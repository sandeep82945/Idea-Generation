This is the situation in which the whole\niii\niv\ndataset is sanitized independently (i.e., row-by-row) and, thus, we implemented LDP algorithms from the perspective of the centralized data owner. In all cases, we concluded that differentially private ML models achieve nearly the same utility metrics as non-private ones.\nKEYWORDS: Differential privacy, Local differential privacy, Categorical data, Machine learning.\nRE\u0301SUME\u0301\nProduction de Donne\u0301es Cate\u0301gorielles Respectant la Confidentialite\u0301 Diffe\u0301rentielle : Conception et Applications au Apprentissage Automatique\nHe\u0301ber Hwang Arcolezi Universite\u0301 Bourgogne Franche Comte\u0301, 2022\nEncadrants: Jean-Franc\u0327ois Couchot, Bechara Al Bouna, et Xiaokui Xiao\nLes organisations prive\u0301es et publiques collectent et analysent re\u0301gulie\u0300rement des donne\u0301es nume\u0301rise\u0301es sur leurs associe\u0301s, volontaires, clients, etc. Cependant, comme la plupart des donne\u0301es personnelles sont sensibles, la conception de syste\u0300mes pre\u0301servant la vie prive\u0301e pour se conformer aux lois sur la confidentialite\u0301 des donne\u0301es, par exemple le re\u0300glement ge\u0301ne\u0301ral sur la protection des donne\u0301es, constitue un de\u0301fi important. Pour re\u0301soudre les proble\u0300mes de confidentialite\u0301, les communaute\u0301s de chercheurs ont propose\u0301 diffe\u0301rentes me\u0301thodes de pre\u0301servation de la confidentialite\u0301, la confidentialite\u0301 diffe\u0301rentielle (DP) se distinguant comme une de\u0301finition formelle qui permet de quantifier le compromis entre confidentialite\u0301 et utilite\u0301. En outre, avec le mode\u0300le de confidentialite\u0301 diffe\u0301rentielle locale (LDP), les utilisateurs peuvent sanitise\u0301 leurs donne\u0301es localement avant de les transmettre au serveur.\nL\u2019objectif de cette the\u0300se est donc double : O1) Ame\u0301liorer l\u2019utilite\u0301 et la confidentialite\u0301 des estimations de fre\u0301quences multiples sous garanties LDP, ce qui est fondamental pour l\u2019apprentissage statistique. Et O2) E\u0301valuer le compromis vie prive\u0301e-utilite\u0301 des mode\u0300les d\u2019apprentissage machine (ML) entra\u0131\u0302ne\u0301s sur des donne\u0301es diffe\u0301rentiellement prive\u0301es.\nPour O1, nous avons premie\u0300rement aborde\u0301 le proble\u0300me sous deux angles \u201cmultiple\u201d, c\u2019est-a\u0300-dire des attributs multiples et des collections multiples dans le temps (e\u0301tudes longitudinales), tout en nous concentrant sur utilite\u0301. Deuxie\u0300mement, nous avons concentre\u0301 notre attention sur l\u2019aspect des attributs multiples uniquement, dans lequel nous avons propose\u0301 une solution axe\u0301e sur la confidentialite\u0301 tout en pre\u0301servant l\u2019utilite\u0301. Dans les deux cas, nous de\u0301montrons par des validations analytiques et expe\u0301rimentales les avan-\nv\nvi\ntages de nos solutions propose\u0301es par rapport aux protocoles LDP de pointe.\nPour O2, nous avons e\u0301value\u0301 empiriquement des solutions base\u0301es sur les ML conc\u0327ues pour re\u0301soudre des proble\u0300mes du monde re\u0301el tout en assurant des garanties de DP. En effet, nous avons principalement utilise\u0301 le cadre perturbation des donne\u0301es d\u2019entre\u0301e de la litte\u0301rature sur les ML pre\u0301servant la confidentialite\u0301. Il s\u2019agit de la situation dans laquelle l\u2019ensemble des donne\u0301es est sanitise\u0301 inde\u0301pendamment (c\u2019est-a\u0300-dire ligne par ligne) et, par conse\u0301quent, nous avons mis en \u0153uvre des algorithmes LDP du point de vue du proprie\u0301taire centralise\u0301 des donne\u0301es. Dans tous les cas, nous avons conclu que les mode\u0300les ML diffe\u0301rentiellement prive\u0301s atteignent presque les me\u0302mes mesures d\u2019utilite\u0301 que les mode\u0300les non prive\u0301s.\nMots cle\u0301s: Confidentialite\u0301 diffe\u0301rentielle, Confidentialite\u0301 diffe\u0301rentielle locale, Donne\u0301es cate\u0301gorielles, Apprentissage automatique.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nPrimarily, I would like to express my greatest thanks to my supervisor, Professor JeanFranc\u0327ois Couchot, for his support, leadership, and encouragement during my Ph.D. study.

I learned a lot from him and gained valuable experiences, which are important for my career as a researcher.\nI am very, very grateful to Selene Cerna, a special person to me, for the many joyful moments, constant support, and for taking care of me all these years. Selene has supported me since my master\u2019s degree and was significant in my growth as a young researcher. I admire Selene for her great willingness to help and share with others, and I am fortunate to be one of those people. I learned a lot with her, both technically and through extensive discussion on research subjects, which essentially helped me during this Ph.D. study.\nI also thank Zh\u0131\u0300 Ha\u0301o Chen who gave me a lot of guidance through many bureaucratic processes to establish me as a foreign doctoral student in France.\nLast but not least, my beloved grandparents, parents, and siblings, my biggest thank to each of you who have supported and cared for me throughout my life. From each of you, a different kind of love has been shown over the years, and I gladly consider and return all the love I can offer you all.\nvii\nCONTENTS"

Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.\u201d\nNotice, however, that with the advancement of technology of information (not only correspondences anymore), protecting individuals\u2019 privacy in the era of Big data is a significant challenge. Indeed, the explosion of the number of connected objects, mobile applications collecting and/or generating any type of data makes personal data ubiquitous and growing exponentially.\nMoreover, when collecting data in practice, one is often interested in multiple attributes of a population, i.e., multidimensional data. For instance, in crowd-sourcing applications, the server may collect both demographic information (e.g., gender, nationality) and user habits in order to develop personalized solutions for specific groups. In addition, one generally aims to collect data from the same users throughout time (i.e., longitudinal studies), which is essential in many situations. For example, the fact that remote antennas of mobile network operators (MNOs) have received cell phone connections may reveal a movement if the same user is identified in different antennas throughout time.\nFrom a human point of view, data analysts can be external providers. In other words, they very rarely have the consent of the data providers (i.e., individuals concerned) to analyze the data. It is, therefore, necessary for the company providing the service to make all possible efforts to follow all the recommendations from data privacy authorities such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GPDR) [112] and, particularly, make any re-identification unfeasible from a practical point of view. On the other hand, even if trusted service providers collect raw personal data, this practice can still lead to privacy breaches, i.e., the risk of information leakage is always possible even if service providers\n5"

[126, 167], for example). Moreover, along with gathering data, extracting high-utility analytics through machine learning (ML) from the collected data is of great interest. Yet, even ML models trained with raw data can also indirectly reveal sensitive information [185, 54] (e.g., cf. [105, 104, 145]).\nIn addition, privacy issues appear more than ever in headlines (e.g., [64, 24, 97, 58, 236, 223, 227]). To tackle privacy concerns, research communities have proposed different methods to preserve privacy, in which the main goal is that anonymized data should not leak private information about any individual [181]. To this end, k -anonymity [18, 20] and differential privacy (DP) [27, 26, 59] are two well-known privacy techniques. On the one hand, k -anonymity is very risky since it does not allow to counter intersecting and/or homogeneity attacks, for example [28, 29]. On the other hand, DP has been increasingly accepted as the current standard for data privacy [73, 132, 220, 59]. However, in the originally proposed centralized DP model, queries perturbed by DP algorithms require the storage of raw databases because the noise is only added at the end of the request. As aforementioned, storing and/or sharing raw databases (as well as training ML models over raw data) is not always desirable because it is necessary to secure all access to them from both a technical and human point of view.\nTo preserve privacy at the user-side, an alternative approach, namely, local differential privacy (LDP), was initially formalized in [32]. With LDP, rather than trusting in a data curator to have the raw data and sanitize it to output queries, each user applies a DP mechanism to their data before transmitting it to the data collector server. The LDP model allows collecting data in unprecedented ways and, therefore, has led to several adoptions by industry. For instance, big tech companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft, reported the implementation of LDP mechanisms to gather statistics in well-known systems (i.e., Google Chrome browser [61], Apple iOS and macOS [106], and Windows 10 operation system [95])."

The OBS team presented us an overview of their deployed system named Flux Vision [53], which publishes real-time statistics on human mobility by analyzing call detail records (CDRs). The Flux Vision system motivated us to study how to gather knowledge from the published statistics as well as to propose a distinct privacy-preserving data collection process. More precisely, from a practical perspective, based on longitudinal and multidimensional OBS mobility reports, we noticed that these statistics could be improved to provide more information about mobility patterns of the individuals concerned. Thus, this is our first objective. Furthermore, our second objective is to propose a privacy-preserving CDRs processing system, which could improve the privacy of MNOs\u2019 clients. Next, from a theoretical perspective on statistical learning, our third objective is to improve the utility and privacy of multiple frequency estimates (i.e., multidimensional and longitudinal data collections) under LDP guarantees.\nIn addition, we also worked on a collaborative framework with Selene Cerna and Christophe Guyeux, members of the AND1 research team from the same research department as ours2. Selene Cerna holds a CIFRE thesis (N 2019/0372) with the fire department named Service De\u0301partemental d\u2019Incendie et de Secours du Doubs (SDIS 25), i.e, an emergency medical services (EMS) in France. For the past few years, the AND team has been investigating ML-based solutions to optimize the SDIS 25 services under a strict confidentiality agreement on the SDIS 25 data. The way these data have been shared motivated us to study the privacy-utility trade-off of ML models trained over sanitized data. That is, we consider the case of centralized data owners (e.g., MNOs and EMS) that collect sensitive information from individuals for both billing and/or legal purposes but do not trust the third entity to develop decision-support systems. So, our fourth and last objective is to evaluate empirically the privacy-utility trade-off of different ML-based solutions trained over sanitized data. We mainly focused on the SDIS 25 data. Notice, however, that this manuscript does not focus on the data collection nor the feature engineering processes carried out by Selene Cerna but, rather, we will present only necessary information about the dataset while focusing on the privacy-utility trade-off analysis."

Second, by studying these aggregate statistics on human mobility, we proposed an LDP-based CDRs processing system to generate multidimensional mobility reports\nthroughout time by offering strong privacy guarantees for each user.\n3. The first two studies on CDRs-based mobility reports are translated to longitudinal statistical releases about the frequency of visitors by multiple attributes. We then\ncontribute to the theoretical aspect under the LDP setting. More precisely, we first focused on optimizing the utility of LDP protocols for longitudinal and multidimensional frequency estimates.\n4. Next, we identified a limitation of the state-of-the-art solution used for multidimensional frequency estimates with LDP, which splits users into groups instead of split-\nting the privacy budget. We then propose a solution to this limitation, which improves the privacy of users while providing the same or better utility (regarding the mean squared error metric) than the state-of-the-art solution.\n5.

            "text": "In the literature, many privacy models have been proposed to tackle privacy issues. In this manuscript, we consider two data privacy definitions, namely, Syntactic privacy and Algorithmic privacy. More specifically, the former notion tries to define a syntactic criterion that should be satisfied by the output dataset through transforming the data. The most influential method is named k -anonymity [18, 20], which was the starting point for other extensions like l-diversity [28] and t-closeness [29]. We introduce k -anonymity in Section 2.2, which will be used in Chapter 11. Throughout this manuscript, we will refer to anonymity as a condition of being \u201csafe in the crowd\u201d (i.e., anonymous).\nThe latter algorithmic notion considers that anonymization is a property of the algorithm, rather than the output dataset. This is the core insight of differential privacy [27, 26], which addresses the paradox of learning about a population while learning nothing about single individuals [59]. One special form of DP is the non-interactive case considered in this manuscript, which corresponds to, e.g., releasing summary statistics, the sanitized dataset, a synthetic dataset, and so on. Throughout this manuscript, we will refer to sanitization the fact that data anonymization was achieved through verifying DP (i.e., using a DP algorithm). In this manuscript, we consistently used differential privacy. So, we present the centralized model of DP in Section 2.3, the local model of DP in Section 2.4, and a local model of DP for location privacy in Section 2.5.\n13\n14 CHAPTER 2. DATA ANONYMIZATION\n2.2/ k -ANONYMITY\nGiven a public medical database without identifiers but where age, ZIP code, ..., were present, and a 20$ dollars public voter records from Massachusetts, United States of America, a Ph.D. student named Latanya Sweeney was able to re-identify the Governor of Massachusetts in this medical database [72]. This re-identification attack took place because there was similar demographic information in both medical databases and voter list records. This way, the combination of several demographic data made people unique in both databases, which allowed Sweeney to directly match these records in both databases.\nTo tackle this uniqueness problem in data publishing, Samarati and Sweeney [18, 20] proposed the k -anonymity model, which requires that each released record to be indistinguishable from at least k\u2212 1 others. Intuitively, the larger k is the better the privacy protection will be. On applying k -anonymity, there is a difference between: explicit identifiers (e.g., names), which are removed or masked to avoid direct re-identification; sensitive attributes (e.g., disease), that might be preserved, and quasi-identifiers (QIDs) such as age and gender, in which k -anonymity seeks to ensure indistinguishability. We recall the definition of k -anonymity in the following.\nDefinition 1 (k -anonymity requirement [18, 20]). Each release of data must ensure that every combination of values of QIDs can be indistinctly matched to at least k individuals.\nWe also recall here an example from [28]. Table 2.1 exhibits a pseudonymized dataset (i.e., with no direct identifiers like \u2018name\u2019) that stores the medical record of a set of individuals. This dataset is composed of both sensitive (disease) and \u2018non-sensitive\u2019 information like age, gender, and nationality. Table 2.2 exhibits a 4-anonymous version of the original data in Table 2.1. Note that in Table 2.2, there is no unique record anymore and there are three different combinations of values grouped by k = 4 records.\nHowever, several studies have pointed out limitations of the k -anonymity model, normally resulting in a new syntactic notion of privacy such as l-diversity [28] and t-closeness [29]. For instance, the last four records in Table 2.2 exhibits the same sensitive value Cancer. So, if an attacker with background knowledge knows someone within [31; 41[ years old contributed to this dataset, it is obvious the disease value for this person. This is also known as homogeneity attack. Besides, k -anonymity does not compose, i.e., if the same person participates in two independent k -anonymous releases, there is no guarantee s/he will be k -anonymous in the composition of both dataset. Suppose the person in the first row (in red color) tested positive for tuberculosis in the hospital that release the 4-anonymous dataset of Table 2.2. Although this hospital had a good laboratory, the person decides to take a second test in another hospital, which releases the 5-anonymous dataset of Table 2.3. So, if an attacker knows, e.g., that someone is 29 years old, lives"

For instance, if each time an attacker adds or removes someone of the database and performs the query \u201chow many people tested positive for this disease?\u201d, in the end, it is possible to infer whose people tested positive by calculating the influence of each individual.\nOne way to preserve privacy in this scenario is to add some noise in the output of the query, which, ideally, should not destroy the utility of the data. In other words, the challenge would be to maximize the utility of the released noisy statistics while preserving the privacy of the individuals. Differential privacy (DP) [27, 26] is a formal definition that allows quantifying the privacy-utility trade-off. Indeed, rather than being a privacy property of the output dataset (like k -anonymity and its variants), DP is a definition that must be respected by a randomized algorithm (i.e., algorithmic notion of privacy).\nIn recent years, DP has been increasingly accepted as the current standard for data privacy with several large-scale implementations in the real-world [219] (cf. [132, 232, 95, 106, 196, 187, 61, 169, 220, 114, 205]). One key reason is that DP addresses the paradox of learning about a population while learning nothing about single individuals [59]. More specifically, the idea is that removing (or adding) a single row from the database should not affect much the statistical results. A formal definition of DP is given in the following.\nDefinition 2 (( , \u03b4)-Differential Privacy [59]). Given > 0 and 0 \u2264 \u03b4 < 1, a randomized algorithm A : D \u2192 R is said to provide ( , \u03b4)-differential-privacy (( , \u03b4)-DP) if, for all neighbouring datasets D1,D2 \u2208 D that differ on the data of one user, and for all sets R of outputs:\nPr[A(D1) \u2208 R] \u2264 e Pr[A(D2) \u2208 R] + \u03b4.

This is equivalent to the privacy goal stated by Dalenius [12] in 1977 as \u201caccess to a statistical database should not enable one to learn anything about an individual that could not be learned without access\u201d. However, respecting such a statement, as proven in [26], no utility could ever be obtained. So, we have to accept leaking some information about individuals in order to have some utility, which is translated to increasing (i.e., privacy-utility trade-off )."

For instance, with DP, there is no need to define the background knowledge that attackers might have, which is equivalent to assuming an attacker with unlimited resources. Besides, DP definition protects anything associated with a single individual, e.g., their presence in the database and their sensitive information [181]. On the other hand, DP does not protect against attribute inference as it may leak information about individuals not present in the database.\nIn addition, DP is immune to post-processing, which means it is not possible to make an\n-DP mechanism less differentially private by evaluating any function f of the response of\nthe mechanism, given that there is no additional information about the database.\nProposition 1 (Post-Processing of DP [59]). If A : D \u2192 R is -DP, then f (A) is also -DP for any function f .\nFurthermore, DP also composes well, which is one of the most powerful features of this privacy model. For instance, accounting for the overall privacy loss consumed in a pipeline of several DP algorithms applied to the same database is feasible due to composition. We recall two types of composition below.\nProposition 2 (Sequential Composition [59]). LetA1 be an 1-DP mechanism andA2 be an 2-DP mechanism. Then, the mechanism A1,2(D) = (A1(D),A2(D)) is ( 1 + 2)-DP.\nProposition 3 (Parallel Composition [59]). Let A1 be an 1-DP mechanism and A2 be an 2-DP mechanism.

The `1-sensitivity of a function f : D \u2192 R, for all neighbouring datasets D1,D2 \u2208 D that differ on the data of one user, is:\n\u22061( f ) = max || f (D1) \u2212 f (D2)||1\nDefinition 4 (`2-sensitivity [59]). The `2-sensitivity of a function f : D \u2192 R, for all neighbouring datasets D1,D2 \u2208 D that differ on the data of one user, is:\n\u22062( f ) = max || f (D1) \u2212 f (D2)||2\nDefinition 5 (Laplace mechanism [27]). For a query function f : D \u2192 R over a dataset D \u2208 D, the Laplace mechanism is defined as:\nAL(D, f (.), ) = f (D) + Lap ( \u22061 ) ,\nin which Lap(b) is the Laplace distribution centered around 0 and of scale b. The Laplace mechanism is proven to preserve -DP [27].\nDefinition 6 (Gaussian mechanism [59]). For a query function f : D \u2192 R over a dataset D \u2208 D and for \u03c3 = \u22062 \u221a 2 ln (1.25/\u03b4), the Gaussian mechanism is defined as:\nAG(D, f (.), , \u03b4) = f (D) +N ( 0, \u03c32 ) in which N ( 0, \u03c32 ) is the normal distribution centered at 0 with variance \u03c32. For \u2208 (0, 1), the Gaussian mechanism provides ( , \u03b4)-DP [59]."

Informally, assume we extract a random subsample from a database and, next, we apply a DP mechanism to this sampled database. Observe now that there is more uncertainty on the output of the DP mechanism since an attacker would be, first, unable to distinguish which data samples were used and, second, there is the DP guarantee.

To preserve privacy at the user-side, an alternative approach, namely, local differential privacy (LDP), was initially formalized in [32]. With LDP, rather than trusting in a data curator to have the raw data and sanitize it to output queries, each user applies a DP mechanism to their data before transmitting it to the data collector server. A formal definition of LDP is given in the following:\nDefinition 7 ( -Local Differential Privacy).

This is a primary objective of LDP, in which the data collector decodes all the sanitized data of the users and can then estimate the number of users for each possible value. The frequency estimation task has received considerable attention in the literature [217, 159, 108, 80, 139, 116, 61, 95, 168, 192, 150] as it is a building block for other complex tasks (e.g., heavy hitter estimation [67, 238, 88, 143], estimating marginals [161, 138, 134, 78], frequent itemset mining [136, 85]).\nLet A j = {v1, v2, ..., vc j} be a set of c j = |A j| values of a given attribute and let be the privacy budget. Each user ui, for i \u2208 {1, 2, ..., n}, has a value v \u2208 A j. Thus, the aggregator\u2019s goal is to estimate a c j-bins histogram, including the frequency of all values in A j. Algorithm 1 exhibits the general procedure for frequency estimation under LDP, which includes: Encoding and Randomization at the user-side, and Aggregation at the serverside (i.e., the aggregator).\nAlgorithm 1 General procedure for frequency estimation under LDP Input : Original data of users, privacy parameter , and local randomizer A. Output : Estimated frequencies.\n# User-side 1: for each user ui (i \u2208 {1, 2, ..., n}) with input value v \u2208 A j do 2: Encode(v) into a specific format (if needed); 3: Randomize(v) with A(v, ); 4: Transmit the randomized output to the aggregator. 5: end for # Server-side 6: The server aggregates the reported values and estimates their frequency. 7: return : c j-bins histogram, including the frequency of all values in A j.\nIn addition, if one intends to collect data from the same population, i.e., longitudinal studies, the authors in [61] introduced the concept of memoization. The idea behind memoization is to use two steps of sanitization, where the first step uses an upper bound value of\n\u221e-LDP and only outputs lower epsilon reports using this randomized data. This will be a subject of study in Chapter 6. In the next three subsections, we will review state-of-the-art LDP protocols for non-longitudinal frequency estimation (a.k.a. frequency oracles)."

We then presented differential privacy, which is a definition that should be satisfied by a randomized algorithm. While the former satisfies a syntactic notion of privacy, i.e., the final database should satisfy \u201ck -anonymity\u201d, DP is a property of the process. In addition, DP offers strong post-processing and composition properties, which are important in designing differentially private systems for real-life applications. Besides, we have presented the decentralized setting of DP, also known as local DP, in which there is no need to assume a trusted server. In the LDP setting, the aggregator already knows the users\u2019 identifiers, but not their private data. In this case, users apply a differentially private algorithm in their own device such that only perturbed data is sent to the aggregator. Also, we have presented geo-indistinguishability, which is an LDP model to protect location privacy. Geo-indistinguishability utilizes a Laplacian noise to perturb the actual location of a user before transmitting to the (un)trusted server and has received considerable attention due to its effectiveness and simplicity of implementation (e.g., Location Guard [6]).

The system is optimized by a quick parallel tree construction and adapted to be fault-tolerant under distributed environments.\n\u2022 Light Gradient Boosted Machine (LGBM) [100] is a novel gradient boosting frame-\nwork, which implemented a leaf-wise strategy. This strategy significantly reduces computational speed and resource consumption in comparison to other decision tree-based algorithms."

In this manuscript, we mainly used Bayesian optimization (BO) [86] and random search optimization [40]. On the one hand, to apply a random search, one initially defines the search space as a bounded domain of hyperparameters values. Next, each step of the optimization randomly samples a point in that domain, builds the model, and then evaluates its performance. In the end, the random search optimization selects the most accurate method encountered during the iterative process. On the other hand, in contrast to random search, Bayesian methods track the entire set of prior evaluations of hyperparameters, which are used to build a probabilistic model of mapping hyperparameters to the likelihood of a score of an objective function. Rather than random sampling points in the domain, the goal of BO is to improve as iterations go by."

For example, let x be a real-valued vector, then a differentially private version of it using the Laplace mechanism (cf. Section 2.3.2) is: x\u0302 = x + Lap(b). This is also true for categorical data, e.g., by randomizing each data point in x with some LDP protocol (i.e., frequency oracle) from Section 2.4. On the one hand, input perturbation is the easiest method to apply [54, 140] and it is independent of any ML and post-processing techniques. On the other hand, the perturbation of each sample in the dataset may have a negative impact on the utility of the trained model.\nIn the literature, some works [191, 98] started to investigate how \u2018input perturbation\u2019 through applying the Gaussian mechanism [59] on data samples can guarantee ( , \u03b4)DP on the final ML model. In [211], the authors sanitized each sample with LDP protocols (GRR [80] for categorical data and the Piecewise mechanism [166] for realvalued data) for training ML models to compare with federated learning. Indeed, there are an extensive literature on training ML models over differentially private data (e.g., [124, 170, 93, 243, 179, 60, 210, 172, 148])."

Indeed, DL models trained with DP-SGD provide provable DP guarantees for their input data. Two new parameters are added to the standard stochastic gradient descent algorithm, namely, clip and noise multiplier. The former is used to bound how much each training point can impact the model\u2019s parameters, and the latter is used to add controlled Gaussian noise to the clipped gradients in order to ensure DP guarantee to each data sample in the training dataset.

These values were completed with the average value for that respective week, region, and 30-min interval. We will refer to this pre-processed dataset as Paris-DB throughout this manuscript.\nMore formally, the Paris-DB is a multivariate time series dataset X(t1,t\u03c4) with aggregate number of people per 6 regions and corresponding time period t \u2208 [1, \u03c4] of 30-min intervals.

We started revising supervised learning and classification and regression tasks, all three considered in this manuscript. Next, we have reviewed state-of-the-art ML algorithms ranging from linear (i.e., LASSO), decision-tree learning (i.e., LGBM and XGBoost), and deep learning (e.g., MLP, RNNs) models. We also presented the metrics that will be used to assess the models\u2019 performance, as well as two hyperparameter tuning methods (i.e., random search and Bayesian optimization). Lastly, we also reviewed how to build differentially private ML models, which fundamentally depends on where the DP guarantee is added. That is, by the post-processing property of DP [59] (cf. Section 2.3.1), everything after DP, stays DP. Indeed, we mainly consider in this manuscript the rigorous input perturbation setting, which sanitizes each data sample independently (i.e., rowby-row). Although utility may drop, we believe the privacy-utility trade-off is worthwhile since the sanitized dataset will be protected if data leakes [228], and the ML model will also be differentially private, protecting the data against, e.g., data reconstruction attacks, membership inference attacks [105, 104]. On the other hand, we also briefly presented another setting, namely, gradient perturbation contextualized to deep learning methods trained with the DP-SGD [73] algorithm. Lastly, we also presented the datasets we will be using in this manuscript to perform our experiments.\nIII CONTRIBUTION: IMPROVING THE UTILITY AND\nPRIVACY OF LDP PROTOCOLS\n41\n4 MS-FIMU: A MULTIDIMENSIONAL DATASET TO EVALUATE LDP\nPROTOCOLS\nIn Chapters 1, 2, and 3, we have presented all main components that will be used in the rest of the contribution chapters of this manuscript. In this chapter, we start to study statistics on aggregated human mobility data generated by OBS (i.e., with the Flux Vision system [53]). The main objective here is to instantiate a mobility scenario from these statistics and to generate a synthetic dataset that allows simulating the data collection pipeline with the privacy-preserving techniques we develop in the next three Chapters 5, 6, and 7. We emphasize that although the exact Flux Vision\u2019s anonymization method is unknown to the author, we refer to state-of-the-art methods that could give similar results."

            "text": "The main objective of this chapter is to propose an approach to instantiate a mobility scenario that matches the anonymized dataset of mobility described in Section 3.3.1.1 named FIMU-DB, which was published by OBS. To generate the FIMU-DB, as stated by OBS, algorithms for data acquisition are compliant with European laws to guarantee the anonymity of each person. Indeed, following the GDPR [112] and CNIL [13], MNOs must anonymize \u201con-the-fly\u201d CDRs used for purposes other than billing. More precisely, if CDRs are used for mobility analytics, these data must be processed within a required time interval (e.g., 15 minutes) if and only if there is a sufficient number of users present for reaching a specific level of anonymity (i.e., \u201chide in the crowd\u201d). Besides, all implicit metadata (e.g., users\u2019 IDs, timestamps) should be excluded before transmitting any data for processing. That is to say, data should be aggregated (respecting anonymity) within the required time interval and all kinds of identifiers must be excluded before any further\n43\n44CHAPTER 4. MS-FIMU: A MULTIDIMENSIONAL DATASET TO EVALUATE LDP PROTOCOLS\nanalysis.\nMore specifically, to generate FIMU-DB, OBS established pre-defined indicators through generalization (e.g., age ranges, socio-professional profiles, ...). Next, an anonymity threshold of k = 20 was defined, i.e., if there are less than 20 users the number is masked with the symbol #. Besides, given the number of identified Orange customers, an extrapolation algorithm was developed to estimate the real population. This latter algorithm can be seen as a perturbation-based technique to add noise to the true value. Thus, within the required time interval, OBS processed CDRs respecting k = 20 for any interval to produce the mobility indicators per day and per the union of consecutive days. We notice that to generate cumulative statistics, i.e., the number of unique users by the union of days could have been done, e.g., using Bloom filters [22]. Also, we use k to indicate the anonymity threshold as it follows the \u201chide in the crowd\u201d protection provided by k -anonymity [18, 20]. However, in our view, we believe that the OBS procedure approximates some of the privacy-preserving approaches described in [89].\nIn summary, the FIMU-DB is subject to noise resulting from the extrapolation of detected Orange clients and from the anonymization procedure to respect the GDPR and the CNIL. Besides, the FIMU-DB has information on the number of people present by the union of consecutive days (also referred to as \u2018cumulative\u2019 information throughout this chapter).\nTherefore, on the one hand, with our proposed approach, we aim to improve the utility of this data, providing the number of people present by all the intersections of days. The mobility scenario we propose represents an invaluable source of information to the city public administration and private companies. Rather than being limited to the number of unique people present in certain regions per union of consecutive days, the scenario allows knowing if they are the same visitors or different visitors over the analyzed time period. With such specific information, companies and public administration would be able to manage their employees and equipment resources efficiently to improve accommodation and transportation systems according to peoples\u2019 mobility, thus providing better attendees comfort and security.\nBesides, we propose to recreate the instantiated mobility scenario with virtual humans, such that the synthetic dataset matches the original statistical data. Therefore, as an open dataset, one can carry out studies such as testing and improving data sanitization techniques. For the rest of this manuscript, we will refer to the final synthetic dataset as Mobility Scenario FIMU (MS-FIMU), which contains 7 categorical attributes for 88, 935 unique users along 7 days (on average \u223c 26, 000 unique users per day). That is to say, a longitudinal and multidimensional dataset.

Hence, we propose to model a more precise mobility scenario, including one day before the FIMU event, the five days of the FIMU, and one day after the FIMU end. In other words, this Nb = 7 days scenario for a 5-days event provides information for these institutions to know the number of people who got in and out of the zone of analysis before, during, and after the event."

First, we are unable to determine the real number of people when OBS published #, i.e., due to the anonymity threshold k = 20. On the one hand, one could think of excluding all # values, which would probably compromise the utility of the data. So, in this chapter, instead of excluding this information, we considered the option of randomly replacing # by an integer within the known range from 1 to 20. However, both solutions (excluding or randomly\n46CHAPTER 4. MS-FIMU: A MULTIDIMENSIONAL DATASET TO EVALUATE LDP PROTOCOLS\nassigning an integer) result in different cardinalities between the seven files that describe the same population, which represents an inconsistency.\nFor instance, Table 4.1 summarizes the records of the first three days of the FIMU. In this scenario, the first day of analysis is Thursday and it has only one record labeled as \u2018Th1\u2019. Friday has two records labeled as \u2018Fr1\u2019 (only Friday) and \u2018Fr2\u2019 (Friday OR Thursday), respectively. And Saturday has three records labeled as \u2018Sa1\u2019 (only Saturday), \u2018Sa2\u2019 (Saturday OR Friday), and \u2018Sa3\u2019 (Saturday OR Friday OR Thursday), respectively. For the rest of this chapter, we will be using this notation (e.g., \u2018Fr1\u2019, \u2018Fr2\u2019, ...) to indicate the \u2018cumulative\u2019 information (i.e., the union of consecutive days).\nIn Table 4.1, both \u2018FR geo\u2019, \u2018FR region\u2019, and \u2018FR age\u2019 columns present the total number of unique French visitors aggregated in each file. This is according to the \u2018Cum. days\u2019 attribute exemplified in Table 3.1 and after replacing randomly all # values. The same procedure is reproduced for the other files. Theoretically, the information from all three columns \u2018FR geo\u2019, \u2018FR region\u2019, and \u2018FR age\u2019 should be equal as they describe the same population. However, this is not true, and the difference between files changes depending on the replacement of all # values (unknown)."

            "text": "As described on the left side of Fig. 4.1, first, we input data with cumulative information and replace the # values. A Boolean map is used to describe every combination of Nb = 7 consecutive days resulting in 2Nb = 128 variables. Then, each of the Nb(Nb + 1)/2 = 28 cumulative days is described as a Boolean vector with 0 (excluded) and 1 (included) values per combination of days according to the representative map.\nThen, a linear program (LP) is defined to instantiate the first feasible solution given a random initial solution, without trying to maximize or minimize any combination of days. The system constraints are the number of people per cumulative day, expressed as Boolean vectors. However, due to both problems of # values and inconsistencies between the cardinalities of the datasets, rather than using the exact \u2018known values\u2019, these problems are addressed by establishing bounds. In this case, the lower and upper bounds are the minimum and maximum values between all the datasets. The motivation for such an approach is to instantiate a feasible solution that respects the values of all available data such that the global error could minimize. More precisely, we are defining a linear constraint solver that computes an arbitrary solution within the set of feasible solutions rather than using the linear program as an optimization mechanism. In this case, the objective function of this system is just a constant (zero). Eq.(4.1) mathematically describes\n48CHAPTER 4.

Then, with such results, the second part is retaken for generating samples of virtual humans aiming to approximate the original data.\nBefore moving on to step 2 (generate synthetic data), let us consider the scenario of Table 4.1 to better understand the proposed LP. Fig. 4.2 illustrates the Boolean map representation of Nb = 3 consecutive days (Th=Thursday, Fr=Friday, Sa=Saturday, and its complements), and the example of both Th1 (unique visitors on Thursday) and S a2 variables (unique visitors present on Saturday OR Friday). Notice that x1 represents the number of visitors that are present neither Thursday nor Friday nor Saturday. This number is obviously not known and, hence, it is not considered.\nConsidering the LP in Eq.(4.1), Eq.(4.2) exhibits the Ai j matrix according to Fig. 4.2 and its lower (lb) and upper bound (ub) with values from Table 4.1 relating to French citizens.\n4.3.

First, using the original data, the frequency of visitors present each day of the week under study is calculated for each sub-category, e.g., on the first day 50.2% are men and 49.8% are women.\nNext, we set up a dictionary for each day grouping its related keys of combination days; people present only Thursday are described by TT, people present both Thursday and Friday are described by TF, and so on. It is noteworthy that the same TF key appears on both Thursday and Friday dictionaries as they are the same people that attended both days in the analysis area.\nThen, an iteration starts filling up each key for the first day with virtual individuals respecting the frequency of men and women, geolife categories, age groups, regions (countries for foreign tourists), the sleeping area, and the visit duration. Afterward, for the next six days, people with similar keys are directly copied from one day to another. In this case, the frequency for each category is re-calculated considering the existing people. The remaining people are then generated according to the new frequency. However, there is one exception about the attribute \u2018visit duration\u2019, which means that people could be present more hours from one day to another (a dynamic attribute). Hence, the approach may vary the duration time of every people each day relative to the real frequency acquired from the original data.\nOnce the stop criterion is met, i.e., when all days have their respective virtual humans, the error is calculated by querying the generated data and comparing it to the original one. The error, total error, and error rate metrics are defined in the following.\nDefinition 8 (Error). Let |A| be the cardinality of set A and A| j be the subset of A restricted to sub-category j, i.e., A| j = {x|x \u2208 A, x \u2208 j}. Given a set O (original data), a set G (generated data), and sub-categories j related to each specific category (i.e., from the gender\n50CHAPTER 4. MS-FIMU: A MULTIDIMENSIONAL DATASET TO EVALUATE LDP PROTOCOLS\ncategory there are two sub-categories, feminine and masculine), the error is defined as\nerror( j) = ||G| j| \u2212 |O| j||.\nDefinition 9 (Total Error). The total error TE is the sum of errors per sub-category j and per day i defined as\nT E = n\u2211\ni=1 \u2211 j=category error( j)i.\nDefinition 10 (Error Rate). The error rate ER is calculated considering j original datasets\nER = T E\u2211 j=dataset \u2211 j=category |O j| j| .\nThese computations are repeated for m iterations based on a random search optimization approach. In particular, the first parameter randomly generated is the # values within the range 1-20, which changes the number of people per day and, consequently, per file at every iteration. In addition, considering the LP in Eq.(4.1), an initial solution is randomly generated such that the linear constraint solver can provide a different mobility scenario at each iteration. Then, the error rate metric is calculated. Finally, the mobility scenario and synthetic dataset with the smallest error rate are recovered as a final solution.\nSome motivations for such a random search approach are described as follows. First, an initial attempt to model our problem as a linear program resulted in an infinity number of solutions. And second, as aforementioned, the # problem due to privacy constraints had to be handled, resulting in different cardinalities for the datasets."

            "text": "In the literature, several studies on human mobility show that humans follow particular patterns with a high probability of predictability [49]. Hence, there is a high interest in understanding how people move. However, taking into account users\u2019 privacy, research emerges using synthetic and open data to solve such a problem. For example, in [99], the authors provided an approach for creating an open people mass movement dataset. In [74], the authors studied the use of open data for building and validating a realistic urban mobility model. The authors in [101] developed a framework for the generation of individual human mobility trajectories with realistic Spatio-temporal patterns. Finally,\n54CHAPTER 4. MS-FIMU: A MULTIDIMENSIONAL DATASET TO EVALUATE LDP PROTOCOLS\nthe authors in [130] proposed a mobility dataset generation method of social vehicles traveling.\nAll the aforementioned works treated a different problem from ours, which corresponds to different data types available they have. In our case, there were only statistical mobility indicators with information about the unique number of people per day and per the union of consecutive days. We then proposed a solution based on linear programming (linear constraint solver) to instantiate a feasible solution and, thus, reconstruct virtual humans based on statistics. We also notice that the authors in [87] used a similar linear constraint solver to their problem.\nRegarding our solution described in Section 4.3 and summarized in Fig. 4.1, one can notice that we have split the problem into two steps. Indeed, solving a single linear program considering the number of intersections 2Nb = 128 for each sub-category (e.g., masculine or feminine) of each category (e.g., gender) would probably require a large number of variables and, thus, it was not considered in this chapter. In addition, we consider that virtual humans have \u2018static\u2019 values for five attributes, i.e., each person has always the same geolife profile; people are from one unique region, they normally sleep in the same zone, and so on. The exception is for the \u2018Visit duration\u2019 attribute, which was considered \u2018dynamic\u2019 since people can vary the number of hours they stay in the FIMU per day.\nHence, as noticed in Fig. 4.3 and Table 4.3, the error metrics are very low when querying people in each sub-category from the generated data, compared to the original one. In other words, the result, which is one of many possible scenarios, closely describes how people behave during the week of interest. With such results, it is possible to assert with a reasonable amount of accuracy how many people were present in each combination (intersection) of 7 days, which is a more precise mobility scenario than just knowing the number of unique people per day or cumulative days (union).\nFor instance, from the final mobility scenario, and by querying the generated dataset, we can find out how many foreign tourists, French tourists, and residents are present only one or several days at the FIMU event, as well as their specific information such as socio-professional profile, region or countries, age groups, gender, and so on. For illustrative purposes, it is possible to know that from 176 visitors present during all week (see Table. 4.2, highlighted in bold), 153 are residents, 20 are French tourists, and 3 are foreign tourists.\nMoreover, it is noticed that foreign tourists were present normally at one unique day or at most three consecutive days, which is consistent with reality. Indeed, foreign people come to the FIMU for few days and usually have no \u2018gaps\u2019 between days, such as one day present, the other not, and the next yes. Additionally, the premise of assigning one unique sleeping area for each visitor seems to indicate that the approach is consistent."

For instance, if one has information about the presence of foreign tourists on a specific combination of days and if they do not change much their sleeping place, accommodation companies can improve their future strategies to assist this population. Similarly, tourism companies would be more prepared knowing that most of the people present during the week are residents while tourists are rather present during the weekend of the FIMU event."

            "text": "This chapter proposes an approach to infer and recreate synthetic data that provides a precise mobility scenario based on one-week statistical data of unions of consecutive days made available by [53]. Our improved mobility scenario presents specific information about people present on one or several combinations of days (i.e., all intersections of days). The proposed approach is generic enough to apply to other mobility scenarios that rely on databases with information about the cumulative number of unique people for days (i.e., the union of consecutive days). Moreover, the proposed approach overcomes challenges due to data acquisition with anonymization techniques such as an anonymity threshold (k = 20 in this case) and extrapolation algorithms.\nThe results show that the proposal can be efficiently applied to generate a synthetic dataset with specific information about people present in a certain region, for instance, attending the FIMU [94] as was the case in this study. Finally, the generated and open dataset named MS-FIMU closely matches the original statistics with a low error rate, which substantiates the proposed approach. One direct use case of MS-FIMU is to evaluate differentially private cardinality estimation methods on longitudinal studies (e.g., [87, 66, 115]). Besides, experimenting with machine learning tasks could also be considered. Lastly, one can also evaluate the effectiveness of new LDP protocols on multidimensional and longitudinal frequency estimates, as we present in Chapters 6 and 7, or other complex tasks such as marginal estimation (e.g., [233, 161, 138, 134, 78]).\n5 LDP-BASED SYSTEM TO GENERATE MOBILITY REPORTS FROM CDRS\nIn Chapters 1, 3, and 4, we have reviewed mobility reports published by OBS Flux Vision system [53]. These mobility reports are, in other words, longitudinal statistics releases about the frequency of visitors by multiple attributes (e.g., as in [169, 62] too). Although current data privacy legislations require anonymity \u201con-the-fly\u201d to collect CDRs for human mobility analytics, we posed ourselves two questions: Q1) what if MNOs do not trust the data analyzers (e.g., third party companies working on mobility analytics)? Or Q2) what if future data privacy legislations require different privacy protections than \u201canonymity onthe-fly\u201d, e.g., demanding \u201csanitization on-the-fly\u201d? Indeed, while the former anonymity protection provides syntactic privacy through the \u201csafe in the crowd\u201d concept, the latter sanitization protection provides algorithmic privacy by using a DP model, as we defined in Section 2.1 for this manuscript. These questions Q1 and Q2 initially motivated the core contributions of this chapter where we propose an LDP-based CDRs processing system to generate mobility reports, following the objective of the OBS Flux Vision system. We invite the reader to refer to Chapter 2 for the background on LDP. Lastly, we highlight that although we refer to our proposal as LDP-based, this is a centralizer data owner (i.e., MNOs) that applies the LDP protocol on its servers, thus, providing -DP guarantees for users."

            "text": "We start by recalling some requirements of data privacy regulations on collecting and analyzing CDRs for human mobility analytics. For instance, although MNOs have the right and duty to store CDRs, according to the GDPR [112], it does not mean MNOs have the right to use the collected raw data for other purposes. Besides, the CNIL [13], in France, requires that CDRs used for human mobility analysis (i.e., for purposes other than billing) to be anonymized on-the-fly (i.e., \u201chide in the crowd\u201d). One reason behind\n57\n58CHAPTER 5. LDP-BASED SYSTEM TO GENERATE MOBILITY REPORTS FROM CDRS\nthis is because users cannot sanitize their data locally since CDRs are automatically generated on MNOs\u2019 servers through the use of a service (e.g., making/receiving phone calls). Lastly, MNOs cannot process data for mobility analytics containing users\u2019 IDs or a hashed version of them as they are still unique IDs.\nThe purpose of this chapter is, thus, to propose a privacy-preserving system for human mobility analytics through mobile phone CDRs. This way, MNOs can benefit from such an important data source while respecting their clients\u2019 privacy and following major recommendations of data protection authorities such as the GDPR and CNIL. Indeed, we intend to analyze human mobility through multidimensional and longitudinal statistical data releases (e.g., as in [169, 62, 53]). Throughout this paper, \u201cmultidimensional\u201d refers to data with multiple d > 1 attributes. For instance, as shown in Section 3.3.1.1 and Chapter 4, from subscription data, MNOs can gather: gender, age range (date of birth), and county origin (invoice address). From CDRs there is the coarse location (antennas that handled the service) and if it is \u201croaming data\u201d (foreign mobile) or not. Besides, \u201clongitudinal\u201d refers to data with temporal information, i.e., analyzing human mobility over time (a.k.a. continuous monitoring in software literature [61, 95, 149]).\nTherefore, we propose an LDP-based CDRs processing system for such purpose that goes beyond \u201canonymity on-the-fly\u201d, i.e., with \u201csanitization on-the-fly\u201d. The main reason to use the local DP model is that it allows sanitizing each sample independently while providing strong privacy guarantees (see Section 2.4). So, while MNOs CDRs processing systems utilizes each users\u2019 raw information (e.g., gender masculine, age range <18, ...), we propose that an LDP version of each users\u2019 data be used instead, i.e., LDP(masculine), LDP(<18). In fact, we assume that MNOs CDRs processing systems have, first, pre-defined the mobility indicators (e.g., gender, age-ranges, nationality, ...) they want to release.\nFig. 5.1 illustrates our system model overview and the considered trust boundary (in dashed line). The first entity, namely, users, refers to MNOs\u2019 clients, which are not able to sanitize their data locally when using a service (e.g., exchanging SMS). The second entity is the MNOs themselves, which are data holders and must ensure \u201csanitization on-thefly\u201d through an LDP mechanism for all CDRs used for analyzing human mobility. The third entity is the data processor (considered as an untrusted analyzer in our model), which processes data to generate statistical indicators. The last entity is the data consumers, which have access only to released statistics.\nWith more details, each time a user makes a call, or sends SMS, or connects to the internet ..., a CDR is generated and is stored by MNOs offline for billing and legal purposes, along with their subscription data (e.g., invoice address). This way, instead of MNOs transmit the raw data of this user (according to the pre-defined indicators), this data should be processed by an -LDP algorithm in the MNOs servers, where is a pub-"

Besides, similar to MNOs CDRs processing systems, the users\u2019 IDs should be excluded before transmitting any data to the analyzer. Thus, improving the users\u2019 privacy.\nTherefore, the data processor would only store uncorrelated (i.e., no IDs) -LDP data. At the end of the period of analysis, the analyzer can aggregate these data to produce statistics through multiple frequency estimation, which depends on the LDP algorithm and the public parameter . Notice that with our proposal, both users and MNOs are safeguarded as no raw data will be collected to analyze human mobility anymore. However, -LDP values must not result in indirect unique identifiers. Indeed, if one can detect a unique -LDP value for many days, it would violate the privacy of this user as s/he could be easily tracked away.\nSo, in this chapter, we propose to use the GRR [80] LDP mechanism, which corresponds to the situation where no particular encoding is chosen. In other words, with GRR, -LDP private reports will become anonymous depending on the size of the attribute (e.g., feminine or masculine, for the gender attribute), thus allowing a longitudinal collection of data. Lastly, we propose to generate mobility reports similar to the FIMU-DB of Section 3.3.1.1, i.e., multidimensional frequency estimates by day and by the union of consecutive days (\u201ccumulative frequency estimates\u201d).\nThe remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. In Section 5.2, We extended the analytical analysis of GRR for multidimensional frequency estimates. Next, we explain our proposed LDP-based CDRs processing system in Section 5.3. In Section 5.4, we present our results, its discussions, and review related work. Lastly, in Section 5.5 we present the concluding remarks. The results of Section 5.2 and a preliminary version of the proposed LDP-based CDRs processing system in Section 5.3 with its results were published in a full paper [215] at the 15th IFIP Summer School on Privacy and Identity Management.\n60CHAPTER 5.

Let d \u2265 2 be the total number of attributes, c = [c1, c2, ..., cd] be the domain size of each attribute, n be the number of users, and be the whole privacy budget. An intuitive solution is splitting (Spl) the privacy budget, i.e., assigning /d for each attribute. The other solution is based on uniformly sampling without replacement (Smp) only r attribute(s) out of d possible ones, i.e., assigning /r per attribute. Notice that both solutions satisfy -LDP according to the sequential composition theorem [59]. More visually, Fig. 5.2 illustrates both Spl and Smp solutions, with r = 1 for Smp.\nFor the first case, Spl, replacing by /d in Eq. 2.8, gives the variance (\u03c321) of GRR as:\n\u03c321,GRR = e /d + c j \u2212 2 n(e /d \u2212 1)2 .

According to the left side of Fig. 5.3, MNOs should define the privacy guarantee , which is uniform for all users. Let Nb be the whole period of analy-\nsis (e.g., total number of days) known a priori, e.g., before an event like the FIMU. So, the data processor should initialize Nb(Nb + 1)/2 empty databases, which corresponds to all days and union of consecutive days. For instance, if Nb = 3 one will have setdb = {D1,D2,D2 \u222a D1,D3,D3 \u222a D2,D3 \u222a D2 \u222a D1}.\n2. LDP-based sanitization on-the-fly. Similar to MNOs CDRs processing systems (e.g., [53]), MNOs will continue to be responsible for applying a privacy-preserving\ntechnique. In our proposal, the privacy-preserving technique corresponds to an LDP-based sanitization model on-the-fly using the GRR [80] protocol explained in Section 2.4. Besides, we assume that MNOs store information about their clients such that each user ui (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) has a discrete-encoded tuple record v = (v1, v2, ..., vd), which contains the values of d categorical attributes A = {A1, A2, ..., Ad} (according to the pre-defined mobility indicators, e.g., as the table in the right side of Fig. 5.3). Since we have multiple attributes, we adopt the Smp solution from 5.2,\n62CHAPTER 5. LDP-BASED SYSTEM TO GENERATE MOBILITY REPORTS FROM CDRS\nwhich randomly samples a single attribute per user and uses the whole privacy budget to sanitize it. For the rest of this chapter, we will refer to this solution as Smp[GRR].\nTherefore, we propose that MNOs apply GRR a single time (i.e., once and for all) for each users\u2019 sampled data B = v j and consistently use the sanitized value B\u2032 for all future reports \u3008 j, B\u2032\u3009. In other words, MNOs would not use any raw data anymore but, rather, an -LDP version of their clients\u2019 data. Since GRR does not utilize any particular encoding, the uncorrelated -LDP values could be made \u2018anonymous\u2019 within all other reports, thus, allowing longitudinal data collection with no risk of creating a \u2018unique ID\u2019. Notice that our solution can not ensure \u201canonymity on-the-fly\u201d, but instead, the -LDP values could probably be \u201chidden in the crowd\u201d depending on the domain size of the attributes.\nMoreover, on the MNOs\u2019 side, each CDR contains metadata such as the user\u2019s ID and timestamp (Actual Day \u2013 AD). Hence, for each user, MNOs calculate a listdb that represents which databases (days and union of consecutive days) the -LDP data should be stored by the data processor (with no ID). For instance, the listdb can be calculated by knowing the days this user \u201cwas present\u201d (by CDRs) or, similarly, by using Bloom filters [22] to de-duplicate the users\u2019 presence throughout days.

Finally, at the end of the analysis period, the analyst will have Nb(Nb+1)/2 databases, with the estimated frequencies for all d attributes in each combination of union of consecutive days.\nExample to calculate listdb. To calculate the listdb for each user, consider the right side of Fig. 5.3, which has data for Nb = 3 days. First, let Actual Day AD = 1 (the first day of analysis). So, user ID = 1 is detected by the MNO and his listdb = {D1,D2 \u222a D1,D3 \u222a D2 \u222a D1}. The reason behind this is that if this user does not appear anymore, we have considered his -LDP report in the whole analysis. Next, let AD = 2. For the same user ID = 1, the MNO knows he was present in both two days, hence, his listdb = {D2,D3 \u222aD2} as the previous day his -LDP report was already stored in D2\u222aD1 and D3\u222aD2\u222aD1.

For instance, data processors need to initialize Nb(Nb + 1)/2 empty databases where if one wishes to analyze an enhanced detailed scenario, it grows up very fast (i.e., with at least an Nb2/2 factor). However, this scenario is only intended in special mobility analytics cases, e.g., tourism events, natural disasters, following up the spread of diseases, etc. In addition, there is high power for computation and powerful tools to deal with big data nowadays. One way to smoothen this problem in, e.g., daily scenarios, is to exclude the stored data after retrieving statistics.\nFurther, similar to the FIMU-DB explained in Chapter 3, there is an important loss of information by not calculating the intersection of users through days. That is, we propose to compute the number of users per union of consecutive days as it may have very few users per intersection (see our enhanced mobility scenario in Table 4.2 of Chapter 4). The latter would not produce accurate frequency estimations due to the LDP formulation, which is data-hungry. At first glance, one can surely compute the pair-wise intersection for any two days in the analysis period using |A \u2229 B| = |A| + |B| \u2212 |A \u222a B|. One possibility of solving the whole problem is to use the methodology developed in Chapter 4, which models our proposed mobility scenario (days and union of consecutive days) as a linear program to find a solution for all intersections. Besides, for the case where one can have\n64CHAPTER 5. LDP-BASED SYSTEM TO GENERATE MOBILITY REPORTS FROM CDRS\nsufficient data samples per pair-, triple-, ..., and Nb-wise intersections, one can easily extend our methodology for such a case. However, the storage factor is even bigger as data processors would have to initialize 2Nb \u2212 1 empty databases (all combinations of intersections of days).\nLastly, the single time sanitization step implies always reporting the same sanitized value B\u2032 for the unique sampled attribute, which can be effective in the cases where the true client\u2019s data does not vary (static) [61, 95]. On the other hand, a measured attribute such as location is dynamic. Therefore, for the users who sample a dynamic attribute, for each different value, a new sanitized value would be generated, thus accumulating the privacy budget by the sequential composition theorem [59]. Yet, in our privacypreserving architecture (Fig. 5.1), the collected/stored -LDP reports are \u2018uncorrelated\u2019 from users, as no ID will be stored. Thus, improving the privacy of users."

Lastly, for the sake of illustration, Fig. 5.6 illustrates multidimensional frequency estimates for a single day (D7) and for the union of all consecutive days (D7 \u222a D6 \u222a ... \u222a D1) using the adopted Smp[GRR] solution and = 1.\nAs one can notice in Fig. 5.4, overall, the proposed Smp[GRR] solution adopted in our LDP-based CDRs processing system consistently and considerably outperforms the baseline Spl[GRR]. In Fig. 5.5, except for = 1, the curves of Smp[GRR] are under even to the best one of Spl[GRR] using the highest privacy budget = 6. As also highlighted in the literature [166, 83, 108], privacy budget splitting is sub-optimal, which leads to higher estimation error. Indeed, in a multidimensional setting, the combination of privacy budget splitting and high numbers of values in a given attribute (e.g., Region with 22 values) leads\n66CHAPTER 5. LDP-BASED SYSTEM TO GENERATE MOBILITY REPORTS FROM CDRS\nto lower data utility even for high privacy regimes. On the other hand, the Smp[GRR] solution based on random sampling uses the whole privacy budget to a single attribute, and this problem is, hence, minimized. However, there is also an error provided by the sampling technique, which is due to observing a sample instead of the entire population.\nMoreover, in Figs. 5.5 and 5.6, it is noteworthy that the MS Eavg decreases as the data size increases. Intuitively, this is due to LDP, which requires a large amount of data to guarantee a good balance of noise. In our case, single days (e.g., D7) have less users comparing to the union of all consecutive days (e.g., D7 \u222aD6 \u222a ...\u222aD1) and, hence, single days are generally the peak-values in Fig. 5.5. Indeed, these results are consistent with Eqs. (5.1) and (5.2), where the variances are decreasing functions over the number of users n. Yet, these peak values are smoothed using Smp[GRR], which induces less error by sampling a single attribute for each user.\n5.4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 67\nLastly, we highlight that the objective of our experiments was to measure the accuracy loss (based on the MS Eavg error metric) of using our LDP-based \u201csanitization on-thefly\u201d system in comparison with the original statistics produced by an \u201canonymity on-thefly\u201d based system. As shown in the results, accurate multidimensional frequency estimates could be achieved for practical purposes with strong privacy guarantees (see, e.g., Fig. 5.6 with = 1). On the other hand, in terms of the overall privacy budget per user, in the worst case, the sequential composition theorem [59] applies for each data release. As also pointed out in [232, Section 8.4, Table 2] and in [219], real-world DP systems utilize as large as the ones experimented in this manuscript on daily basis. Thus, some future implementation of our LDP-based CDRs processing system to generate mobility reports is a potential perspective."

            "text": "As reviewed in Chapters 1 and 2, mobile phone CDRs have been largely used to analyze human mobility in several contexts, e.g., the spread of infectious diseases [156, 44, 65, 218, 186, 237], natural disasters [127, 182, 44], tourism [53, 62, 194], and so on. However, concerning privacy, de Montjoye et al. [49] show that humans follow particular patterns, which allows predicting human mobility with high accuracy. For instance, in a dataset of 1.5 million users, the authors showed that 95% of this population can be re-identified using four approximate locations and their timestamps. Besides, Zang and\n68CHAPTER 5. LDP-BASED SYSTEM TO GENERATE MOBILITY REPORTS FROM CDRS\nBolot [38] have performed extensive experiments showing that the anonymization of location data from CDRs using k -anonymity [18, 20] leads to privacy risks. Further, in nontechnical papers, de Montjoye et al. [122] discuss the conscientious use of mobile phone data for mobility analytics, and Buckee [56] highlights both the importance of collecting CDRs to analyzing human mobility in low-income countries and the privacy concerns that rise up.\nBecause of these privacy issues, MNOs tend to publish aggregated mobility data [218, 109, 237, 135, 53], e.g., the number of users by coarse location at a given timestamp or the number of users in a single location (cf. Section 3.3.1.1). However, as recent studies have shown, even aggregated mobility data can be subject to membership inference attacks [103, 198] and users\u2019 trajectory recovery attack [135, 109]. More precisely, the later authors in [135, 109] showed that their attack reaches accuracies as high as 73% \u223c 91%, suggesting generalization and perturbation through DP [27, 26, 59] as a means to mitigate this attack. Therefore, it is vital to deploying systems that allow analyzing human mobility (e.g., through CDRs) with strong privacy-preserving guarantees.\nWith these elements in mind and with the motivating questions Q1 and Q2 from the beginning of this chapter, we have proposed a solution beyond \u201canonymity on-the-fly\u201d since aggregated location data are still at risk of leaking private information. Indeed, our solution considers \u201csanitization on-the-fly\u201d with an LDP protocol, in which rather than transmitting aggregated raw data for the analyzer, we propose that MNOs sanitize each users\u2019 data independently (as if it was made by the user) and send it to the untrusted analyzer.\nAs we present in this chapter, implementing the Smp[GRR] solution in our methodology could ensure that -LDP private reports will not become indirect unique IDs. The reason behind this is because no particular encoding is used with GRR and, thus, -LDP values are generic to any user. So, it is possible to utilize the sanitized value in longitudinal studies if the domain size of attributes is not big. Besides, notice that each time users connect, MNOs will always report the same attribute out of d possible ones. That is, even though users appear all days in the analysis (in this dataset \u223c 0.2% of users), MNOs will never report the remaining d \u2212 1 attributes, which were not sampled. Lastly, our solution would also safeguard MNOs as no raw data would be shared with the analyzer for the purpose of human mobility analysis, but, rather, -LDP values that are robust to post-processing. One clear limitation of our LDP-based CDRs processing system is that the recent privacy amplification by shuffling [141, 149, 184, 202, 224] does not apply. Although all users\u2019 IDs are excluded, the signals\u2019 order is not hidden due to \u201csanitization on-the-fly\u201d. That is, the -LDP reports are not aggregated in \u201cbatches\u201d to provide some \u201canonymity\u201d and profit from amplification. Therefore, extending our solution to the shuffle DP model is a potential and intended perspective."

We proposed an LDPbased CDRs processing system as an extension of \u201canonymity on-the-fly\u201d to satisfy \u201csanitization on-the-fly\u201d, thus, providing higher privacy guarantees for each user. With our proposal, we can have preliminary answers to the motivating questions Q1 and Q2 highlighted at the beginning of this chapter. That is, such a privacy-preserving system would allow MNOs to share the sanitized data with untrusted analyzers, with a more strict setting that allows sanitizing each data independently on-the-fly. As shown in the results, the proposed LDP-based CDRs processing system using Smp[GRR] achieves accurate multidimensional frequency estimates for practical purposes (cf. Fig. 5.6, for example), proving its effectiveness in producing mobility reports as the original ones from OBS.\nOn the one hand, this is because GRR has low utility loss for attributes with small domain sizes. On the other hand, if MNOs intend to pre-define a mobility indicator on a higher domain (e.g., the number of people in each \u223c 1, 000 bus stops of a given city), other protocols like OUE [108] could provide higher data utility, as its variance does not depend on the domain size. However, since OUE is based on unary-encoding (cf. Section 2.4), it would probably generate a sanitized value similar to a unique ID. In other words, analyzers would be able to use the unique OUE-based reports to track individuals across many days. One possible solution would be using two rounds of sanitization (i.e., memoization [61, 95]), also mentioned in Section 2.4. Indeed, this is one of the core contributions of the next Chapter 6, which investigates how to improve the utility of LDP protocols for longitudinal (based on memoization) and multidimensional frequency estimates.\n6 MULTIDIMENSIONAL FREQUENCY ESTIMATES OVER TIME WITH LDP:\nUTILITY FOCUS\nIn Chapter 5, we focused on a more practical perspective for the problem of generating multidimensional mobility reports throughout time from CDRs. In this chapter, we abstracted this problem and, thus, we contribute on the theoretical aspect by optimizing the utility of LDP protocols for longitudinal and multidimensional frequency estimates. This way, the more the estimated frequencies approximate the real ones, the more ML models can take advantage of when performing learning/prediction tasks [183]. Notice that our solutions are generic to any LDP application scenario (e.g., collecting user behavior in software [61, 95, 106]). We invite the reader to refer to Chapter 2 for the background on LDP."

As in previous Chapter 5, we assume there are d attributes A = {A1, A2, ..., Ad}, where each attribute A j with a discrete domain has a specific number of values c j = |A j|. Each user ui for i \u2208 {1, 2, ..., n} has a tuple v(i) = (v(i)1 , v (i) 2 , ..., v (i) d ), where v (i) j represents the value of attribute A j in record v (i). Thus, for each attribute A j at time t \u2208 [1, \u03c4], the aggregator\u2019s goal is to estimate a c j-bins histogram, including the frequency of all values in A j.\nOn tackling both longitudinal and multidimensional settings, one needs to consider the allocation of the privacy budget, which can grow extremely quickly due to the composition theorem [59]. So, first, we focus on solving the multidimensional aspect with a random sampling-based solution [83, 166, 123, 239], also used in Chapter 5. Next, we considered\n71\n72CHAPTER 6. MULTIDIMENSIONAL FREQUENCY ESTIMATES OVER TIME WITH LDP: UTILITY FOCUS\nthe memoization-based framework [61, 95, 184] to solve the longitudinal setting, which allows having an upper bound to the privacy budget. In both cases, we extended the analysis of three state-of-the-art protocols, namely, GRR [80], OUE [108], and SUE [61], presented in Section 2.4. Thus, combining the optimal cases of each setting, we propose a new solution named Adaptive LDP for LOngitudinal and Multidimensional FREquency Estimates (ALLOMFREE). We demonstrate through experimental validations using four real-world datasets the advantages of ALLOMFREE over state-of-the-art protocols [61, 108], with a gain of accuracy, on average, ranging from 10% up to 55% with the analyzed range of -LDP guarantees.\nThe rest of this chapter is organized as follows. In Section 6.2, we extend the analysis of OUE and SUE to multidimensional data collections. In Section 6.3 we present the memoization-based framework for longitudinal data collections, the extension and analysis of longitudinal GRR and longitudinal UE-based protocols; the numerical evaluation of their performance, and we present our ALLOMFREE solution. In Section 6.4, we present experimental results, discuss our results and review related work. Lastly, in Section 6.5, we present the concluding remarks.

Without loss of generality, minimizing \u03c322,S UE and \u03c3 2 2,OUE is equivalent to minimizing e /2r r(e /2r\u22121)2 and e /r r(e /r\u22121)2 (similar to GRR in Section 5.2), respectively. Hence, let x = r/ be the independent variable, \u03c322,OUE can be rewritten as y1 = 1x \u00b7 e1/x (e1/x\u22121)2 and \u03c3 2 2,S UE can be rewritten as y2 = 1 x \u00b7 e1/2x (e1/2x\u22121)2 as functions over x. It is not hard to prove that both y1 and y2 are increasing functions w.r.t. x and, hence, we have a minimum and optimal when r = 1 (a single attribute per user) for both protocols too.\nTherefore, in this chapter, we adopt the multidimensional setting Smp with r = 1. In this setting, users tell the data collector which attribute was sampled, and its perturbed value ensuring -LDP by applying either GRR or UE-based protocols; the data analyst server would not receive any information about the remaining d \u2212 1 attributes. ."

Whenever one intends to report B, B\u2032 shall be reused to produce other sanitized versions B\u2032\u2032 with lower epsilon values.

One natural question emerges: how to select the parameters {p1, q1, p2, q2} in order to optimize the utility of this L-UE protocol? One can see RR1[UE] as a permanent sanitization and RR2[UE] as a \u2018small\u2019 perturbation to avoid averaging attacks and keep privacy over time.\nBased on SUE and OUE, we are then left with four options: two known solutions that strictly use only OUE or SUE parameters in both sanitization steps and two proposed\n78CHAPTER 6. MULTIDIMENSIONAL FREQUENCY ESTIMATES OVER TIME WITH LDP: UTILITY FOCUS\nsettings that combine both OUE and SUE. These four L-UE protocols are summarized below:\nI both sanitization steps with OUE (L-OUE);\nII both sanitization steps with SUE (L-SUE);\nIII starting with OUE and then with SUE (L-OSUE);\nIV starting with SUE and then with OUE (L-SOUE);\nin which, L-SUE is the well-known Basic-RAPPOR protocol [61], L-OUE is the state-ofthe-art OUE protocol [108] with memoization, and both L-OSUE and L-SOUE are proposed in this chapter.\nAs presented in [108], the OUE variance in Eq. (2.11) is smaller than the SUE variance in Eq. (2.10) and, therefore, the former can provide higher utility than the latter for RR1. On the other hand, we argue that OUE might be too strict for RR2 since the parameter p2 = 1/2 is constant. Thus, we hypothesize that option III (i.e., L-OSUE) is the most suitable one. Without loss of generality, the following analyses are done only for L-OSUE, which can be easily extended to any of the other combinations.\nIn the first round of sanitization, RR1, our solution L-OSUE applies OUE with p1 = Pr[B \u2032 i = 1|Bi = 1] = 12 and q1 = Pr[B \u2032 i = 1|Bi = 0] = 1 e \u221e+1 ( highlighted in the middle of Fig. 6.2).

In other words, following our proposal, one has to set both the upper ( \u221e) and lower ( 1) bounds of the privacy guarantees. For example, let \u221e = 2, one might want that the first 1-LDP report to have high privacy such as\n1 = 0.1, i.e., 1 = 0.05 \u221e (we will use this percentage notation to set up the privacy guarantees).\nTable 6.1 exhibits numerical values of the approximate variance using Eq. (6.5) for all longitudinal protocols with n = 10000, \u221e = [0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0] (as in [108]), and 1 = {0.6 \u221e, 0.5 \u221e, 0.4 \u221e, 0.3 \u221e, 0.2 \u221e, 0.1 \u221e}. For values of 1 higher than 0.6 \u221e, neither L-OUE nor L-SOUE could satisfy some values of 1 because of the constant p2 = 1/2 in RR2. Yet, it is not desirable to have higher values of 1 and, thus, we did not consider values above 0.6 \u221e in our analysis. Besides, Table 6.2 exhibits numerical values for non-longitudinal GRR, OUE, and SUE protocols, which allows evaluating how utility degrades with a second step of sanitization.\nFrom Table 6.1, one can notice that L-GRR presents the smallest variance values"

On the other hand, L-GRR is also the most sensitive to change in privacy parameters \u221e and 1 when c j is large, which leads to much higher variance than when using a non-longitudinal GRR in Table 6.2. Similar to nonlongitudinal GRR, this increase in the variance is due to the number of values c j, which decreases the probability p of reporting the true value. With two rounds of sanitization, it further deteriorates the accuracy of the L-GRR protocol getting to extremely high values, e.g., see L-GRR(c j = 210). Interestingly, when c j = 2 in Table 6.1, the variance of L-GRR with 1 = 0.5 \u221e is a lagged version of the variance values given by the non-longitudinal GRR in Table 6.2. This effect is also observed for both L-SUE (cf. SUE in Table 6.2) and L-OSUE (cf. OUE in Table 6.2) protocols, which use symmetric probabilities on RR2 (i.e., p2 + q2 = 1). We highlighted these values in bold font. However, for L-GRR, this is not true for other values of c j, whose further analysis is beyond the scope of this chapter.\nOn the other hand, L-UE protocols avoid having a variance that depends on c j by encoding the value into the unary representation, which results in a constant variance no matter the size of the attribute. To complement the results of Table 6.1, Fig. 6.3 illustrates numerical values of the approximate variance for L-UE protocols with 1 = {0.3 \u221e, 0.6 \u221e}. With the four options I-IV analyzed, on high privacy regimes, L-OSUE and L-SUE have similar performance while always favoring the proposed L-OSUE one. On lower privacy regimes, our proposed protocols L-SOUE and L-OSUE have similar performance, which outperform both L-OUE and L-SUE protocols. As shown in our experiments, the L-OUE protocol has the worst performance among the four options analyzed, with the exception of high values for \u221e (see the plot on the bottom of Fig. 6.3), when it has performance superior or similar to L-SUE. Indeed, for L-OUE, selecting p2 = 1/2 for the second sanitization step is too strict, which results in higher variance value. Therefore, by comparing the approximate variances, the best option for L-UE protocols, in terms of utility, is starting with OUE and then with SUE as we propose in this chapter, i.e., L-OSUE.\n6.3.5/ THE ALLOMFREE ALGORITHM\nLet A = {A1, A2, ..., Ad} be a set of d attributes with domain size c = [c1, c2, ..., cd], A = {L-GRR,L-OSUE} be a set of optimal longitudinal LDP protocols, and \u221e and 1 be the\n82CHAPTER 6.

Each user ui, for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, holds a tuple v(i) = (v(i)1 , v (i) 2 , ..., v (i) d ), i.e., a private value per attribute. From now on, we will simply omit the index notation v(i) and use v in the analysis as we focus on one arbitrary user ui here. For each attribute j \u2208 [1, d] (we slightly abuse the notation and use j for A j) at time t \u2208 [1, \u03c4], the aggregator aims to estimate the frequencies of each value v \u2208 A j.\nClient-Side. In a multidimensional setting with different domain sizes for each attribute, a dynamic selection of longitudinal LDP protocols is preferred.

Given cr (the domain size), \u221e, and 1, one calculates the parameters f pL\u2212GRR = {p1, q1, p2, q2} and f pL\u2212OS UE = {p1, q1, p2, q2}, for L-GRR and L-OSUE, respectively (cf. Eq.

By requiring each user to submit only 1 attribute with the whole privacy budget, it reduces both the variance incurred as well as the communication cost. Also, since we developed the calculus of the approximate variance in Eq. (6.5) for the proposed longitudinal protocols (L-GRR and L-OSUE), ALLOMFREE can adaptively select the protocol with a smaller variance value to optimize the data utility. Therefore, ALLOMFREE utilizes optimal solutions for both multidimensional and longitudinal data collection settings developed in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 of this manuscript, respectively.\nServer-Side. On the server-side, for each attribute j \u2208 [1, d] at time t \u2208 [1, \u03c4], the estimated frequency f\u0302L(vi) that a value vi occurs for i \u2208 [1, c j] is calculated using Eq.

Indeed, the difference on performance between ALLOMFREE and the other longitudinal LDP protocols increases according to the privacy guarantees, i.e., for high \u221e and 1 values the gap is bigger. This is, first, because in all datasets there are attribute(s) with small domain size (e.g., c j = 2 or\n86CHAPTER 6.

Secondly, by selecting adequately the probabilities p1, q1, p2, q2 for the L-UE protocol (i.e., L-OSUE) also optimizes data utility. Thus, since there is a way to measure the approximate variance of the extended protocols (i.e., Eq. (6.5)), given the sampled attribute, ALLOMFREE adaptively selects one of the optimized protocol (i.e., L-GRR or L-OSUE) whose smaller variance improves the data utility.\nIn addition, among the L-UE protocols applied individually, the experimental results with multidimensional data approximate the numerical results with a single attribute from Section 6.3.4. For instance, the proposed L-OSUE provides similar or improved performance than L-SUE while always outperforming L-OUE. Besides, L-SOUE always outperforms LOUE too, achieving similar performance than L-OSUE and L-SUE in low privacy regimes (i.e., high values). As we have already shown in Section 6.3.4, even though OUE has higher utility than SUE for one-time collection [108], applying OUE twice does not provide higher utility."

Regarding multidimensional frequency estimates, in [108], the authors prove for the optimal local hashing protocol that sending 1 attribute with the whole privacy budget results in less variance than splitting the privacy budget for d = 2 attributes, i.e., with /2. More generically, this is true for any number of attributes d for the GRR protocol, as we have shown analytically and empirically in Chapter 5, and for both OUE and SUE protocols, as shown in Section 6.2.\nBesides, most frequency estimation academic literature focuses on single data collection. To address longitudinal data collections, in [61, 95, 184], the authors proposed LDP protocols based on two rounds of sanitization, i.e., memoization, which was also adopted in this chapter. In the literature, some works [129, 200] applied L-SUE (a.k.a. Basic-RAPPOR [61]) and L-OUE (i.e., OUE [108] two times) for longitudinal frequency estimates. However, rather than strictly using only SUE or OUE twice, we prove that the optimal combination is starting with OUE and then with SUE (i.e., L-OSUE). The privacy guarantees of chaining two LDP protocols has been further studied in [195, 184], which results in Eq. (6.10).

Yet, concerning the privacy guarantees of ALLOMFREE, the memoization step is certainly effective for longitudinal privacy to the cases where the true client\u2019s data does not vary (static) or vary very slowly or in an uncorrelated manner [61]. In many application scenarios, gender, age-ranges, nationality, and other demographic data are generally static or vary hardly ever. On the other hand, for dynamic attributes such as location or the time spent in the application, this is not the case. Therefore, for each different value, a new memoized value would be generated, thus accumulating the privacy budget \u221e by the sequential composition theorem [59]."

            "text": "This chapter investigates the problem of collecting multidimensional data throughout time (i.e., longitudinal studies) for the fundamental task of frequency estimation under -LDP guarantees. We extended the analysis of three state-of-the-art LDP protocols, namely, GRR [80], OUE [108], and SUE [61] (cf. Section 2.4) for both longitudinal and multidimensional frequency estimates. On the one hand, for all three protocols, we theoretically prove that randomly sampling a single attribute per user improves data utility, which is an extension of common results in the LDP literature [184, 108, 208, 238, 138, 215].\n90CHAPTER 6. MULTIDIMENSIONAL FREQUENCY ESTIMATES OVER TIME WITH LDP: UTILITY FOCUS\nOn the other hand, in the literature, both SUE and OUE protocols have been extended (and also applied [129, 200]) to longitudinal studies based on the concept of memoization [61, 95], i.e., L-SUE and L-OUE, respectively. However, we numerically and experimentally show that combining both protocols provides higher data utility, i.e., starting with OUE and then with SUE (L-OSUE) minimizes the variance incurred rather than using SUE or OUE twice. In addition, for the first time, we also extended GRR for longitudinal studies (i.e., L-GRR), which provides higher data utility than the other protocols based on unary encoding for attributes with small domain sizes.\nWe also notice that in a multidimensional setting with different domain sizes for each attribute, a dynamic selection of longitudinal LDP protocols is preferred. Therefore, we also proposed a new solution named Adaptive LDP for LOngitudinal and Multidimensional FREquency Estimates (ALLOMFREE), which combines all the aforementioned results. More specifically, ALLOMFREE randomly samples a single attribute to send with the whole privacy budget and adaptively selects the optimal protocol, i.e., either L-GRR or L-OSUE.\nTo validate our proposal, we conducted a comprehensive and extensive set of experiments on four real-world open datasets. Under the same privacy guarantee, results show that ALLOMFREE consistently and considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art L-SUE [61] and L-OUE [108] protocols in the quality of the frequency estimates, with a gain of accuracy, on average, ranging from 10% up to 55%.\nLastly, we highlight that ALLOMFREE is based on the multidimensional Smp solution, which randomly samples a single attribute out of d ones to send it with -LDP. However, aggregators (who are also seen as attackers) are aware of the sampled attribute and its LDP value, which is protected by a \u201cless strict\u201d e probability bound (rather than e /d). Indeed, in some cases, using the Smp solution may be \u201cunfair\u201d with some users, e.g., users that randomly sample a demographic attribute (e.g., age) might be less concerned to report their data than those whose sampled attribute is socially \u201cmore\u201d sensitive (e.g., disease, location, most common web page). Investigating how to deal with this \u201cunfair\u201d issue on multidimensional frequency estimates is the main goal of the next Chapter 7.\n7 MULTIDIMENSIONAL FREQUENCY ESTIMATES WITH LDP: PRIVACY\nFOCUS\nIn Chapter 6, we tackled both multidimensional and longitudinal settings for the fundamental task of frequency estimation under -LDP guarantees. In this chapter, we continue contributing to the theoretical aspect dedicating our efforts to the multidimensional setting only. Indeed, the sampling-based solution for multidimensional frequency estimates used in Chapters 5 and 6 (i.e., Smp), focuses on optimizing the utility. However, this solution considers that all attributes have equal weight in terms of privacy, which (generally) is not the case in real life. For example, in health data collection, people who randomly sample the disease attribute might hesitate to share their data in comparison with others that randomly sample, e.g., age. This idea extends to other application scenarios, e.g., in software monitoring applications with the \u201cfavorite webpage\u201d attribute, and so on. Therefore, in this chapter, we propose a solution for multidimensional frequency estimates under -LDP guarantees, which improves the privacy of users while providing the same or better performance than the state-of-the-art Smp solution."

As in previous chapters, we assume there are d attributes A = {A1, A2, ..., Ad}, where each attribute A j with a discrete domain has a specific number of values |A j| = c j. Each user ui for i \u2208 {1, 2, ..., n} has a tuple v(i) = (v(i)1 , v (i) 2 , ..., v (i) d ), where v (i) j represents the value of attribute A j in record v (i). Thus, for each attribute A j, the analyzer\u2019s goal is to estimate a c j-bins histogram, including the frequency of all values in A j.\nAs presented in Chapters 5 and 6, there are mainly two solutions for satisfying LDP by\n91\n92CHAPTER 7. MULTIDIMENSIONAL FREQUENCY ESTIMATES WITH LDP: PRIVACY FOCUS\nrandomizing v, namely, Spl and Smp. We will also omit the index notation v(i) and use v in the analysis as we focus on one arbitrary user ui here. Although the Smp solution adds sampling error, in the literature [166, 83, 108, 215, 239, 208, 238, 184, 88] and in previous Chapters 5 and 6, Smp has proven to provide higher data utility than the former Spl solution.\nHowever, as aforementioned, aggregators (who are also seen as attackers) are aware of the sampled attribute and its LDP value, which is protected by a \u201cless strict\u201d e probability bound (rather than e /d). In other words, while both solutions provide -LDP, we argue that using the Smp solution may be unfair with some users. For instance, on collecting multidimensional health records (i.e., demographic and clinical data), users that randomly sample a demographic attribute (e.g., gender) might be less concerned to report their data than those whose sampled attribute is \u201cdisease\u201d (e.g., if positive for human immunodeficiency viruses - HIV).\nThis way, there is a privacy-utility trade-off between the Spl and Smp solutions. With these elements in mind, we formulate the problematic of this chapter as: For the same privacy budget , is there a solution for multidimensional frequency estimates that provides better data utility than Spl and more protection than Smp?\nThus, we intend to solve the aforementioned problematic by answering the following question: What if the sampling result (i.e., the selected attribute) was not disclosed with the aggregator? Thus, since the sampling step randomly selects an attribute j \u2208 [1, d] (we slightly abuse the notation and use j for A j), we propose that users add uncertainty about the sampled attribute through generating d \u2212 1 fake data, i.e., one for each nonsampled attribute.\nWe call our solution Random Sampling plus Fake Data (RS+FD). On the one hand, since RS+FD introduces some uncertainty in the view of the aggregator, we remarked that users\u2019 privacy is amplified by sampling [25, 43, 118, 173, 32]. Besides, we integrate two state-of-the-art LDP protocols, namely, GRR [80] and OUE [108] for single attribute frequency estimation, both presented in Section 2.4, into our RS+FD solution to propose four protocols. We demonstrate through experimental validations using four real-world datasets the advantages of our protocols with RS+FD over the state-of-the-art Spl and Smp solutions.\nThe rest of this chapter is organized as follows. In Section 7.2, we introduce our RS+FD solution, the integration of state-of-the-art LDP mechanisms within RS+FD, and their analysis. In Section 7.3, we present experimental results. Lastly, in Section 7.5, we present the concluding remarks. The proposed RS+FD solution in Section 7.2 and the results presented in Section 7.3 were published in a full paper [213] at the 30th International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2021)."

Let n be the total number of users, d be the total number of attributes, c = [c1, c2, ..., cd] be the domain size of each attribute, A be a local randomizer, and be the whole privacy budget. Each user holds a tuple v = (v1, v2, ..., vd), i.e., a private value per attribute.\n94CHAPTER 7. MULTIDIMENSIONAL FREQUENCY ESTIMATES WITH LDP: PRIVACY FOCUS\nClient-Side. The client-side is split into two steps, namely, local randomization and fake data generation (cf. Fig. 7.1). Initially, each user samples a unique attribute j uniformly at random and applies an LDP mechanism to its value v j. Indeed, RS+FD is generic to be applied with any existing LDP mechanisms (e.g., GRR [80], UE- or hash-based protocols [61, 108], Hadamard Response [139]). Next, for each d \u2212 1 non-sampled attribute i, the user generates one random fake data. Finally, each user sends the (LDP or fake) value of each attribute to the aggregator, i.e., a tuple y = (y1, y2, ..., yd). This way, the sampling result is not disclosed with the aggregator and, thus, an amplified privacy budget\n\u2032 \u2265 can be used.

For each attribute j \u2208 [1, d], the aggregator performs frequency (or histogram) estimation on the collected data by removing bias introduced by the local randomizer and fake data.\nPrivacy analysis. Let A be any existing LDP mechanism, Algorithm 4 satisfies -LDP, in a way that \u2032 = ln (d \u00b7 (e \u2212 1) + 1). Indeed, we observe that our scenario is equivalent to sampling a dataset D without replacement with sampling rate \u03b2 = 1d in the centralized setting of DP, which enjoys privacy amplification (cf. Section 2.3.3). More specifically, let a trusted curator in the centralized DP setting randomly split a datasetD in d disjoint subsets D1,D2, ...,Dd, i.e., each with n/d non-overlapping users. Next, let the trusted curator perform frequency estimation in each subset D \u2208 D with \u2032-DP. Therefore, invoking Theorem 1 (amplification by sampling) and Proposition 3 (parallel composition), all frequency\nestimation queries satisfy -DP with = ln ( 1 + \u03b2(e \u2032 \u2212 1) ) where \u03b2 = 1/d. In our case, with the local model, users sanitize their data locally with a DP model. This way, to satisfy\n-LDP with RS+FD, an amplified privacy parameter \u2032 \u2265 can be used.\nLimitations. Similar to other sampling-based methods for collecting multidimensional data under LDP [123, 83, 166, 239], our RS+FD solution also entails sampling error, which is due to observing a sample instead of the entire population.

The distribution of values in each attribute follows an uniform distribution, for all synthetic datasets.\n\u2022 For the first two synthetic datasets, we fix the number of attributes d = 5 and the\ndomain size of each attribute as c = [10, 10, ..., 10] (uniform), and vary the number of users as n = 50000 and n = 500000.\n\u2022 Similarly, for the third and fourth synthetic datasets, we fix the number of attributes\nd = 10 and the domain size of each attribute as c = [10, 10, ..., 10] (uniform), and vary the number of users as n = 50000 and n = 500000.\n\u2022 Lastly, for the fifth and sixth synthetic datasets, we fix the number of users as\nn = 500000.

In addition, we also conduct experiments on four real-world open datasets with non-uniform distributions. We briefly recall here the datasets from Section 3.3.6 and the generated one in Chapter 4.\n\u2022 Nursery. A dataset from the UCI machine learning repository [96] with d = 9 cat-\negorical attributes and n = 12960 samples.

The domain size of each attribute is c = [9, 52, 47, 17, 3, 7, 24, ..., 43, 5, 3, 3, 3, 2], respectively.\nEvaluation and metrics. We vary the privacy parameter in a logarithmic range as = [ln(2), ln(3), ..., ln(7)], which is within range of values experimented in the literature for multidimensional data (e.g., in [166] the range is = [0.5, ..., 4] and in [239] the range is = [0.1, ..., 10]).\n7.3. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION 103\nBecause our estimators in Eq. (7.1), Eq. (7.3), and Eq. (7.5) are unbiased, their variance is equal to the MSE (cf. Eq. (2.6)), which is commonly used in practice as an accuracy metric [202, 203, 239, 224]. So, to evaluate our results, we use the MSE metric averaged per the number of attributes d to evaluate our results. Thus, for each attribute j, we compute for each value vi \u2208 A j the estimated frequency f\u0302 (vi) and the real one f (vi) and calculate their differences.

Fig. 7.8).\nImpact of the number of attributes. One can notice the effect on increasing d comparing the results of Fig. 7.6 (d = 5) and Fig. 7.7 (d = 10) while fixing n and c (uniform number of values). For instance, even though there are twice the number of attributes, the accuracy (measured with the averaged MSE metric) does not suffer much. This is because the amplification by sampling ( e \u2032\u22121\ne \u22121 = 1 \u03b2 [43]) depends on the sampling rate\n\u03b2 = 1d , which means that the more attributes one collects, the more the \u2032 is amplified, i.e.,\n\u2032 = ln (d \u00b7 (e \u2212 1) + 1); thus balancing data utility.\nBesides, in Fig. 7.8, one can notice a similar pattern, i.e., increasing the number of attributes from d = 10 (left-side plot) to d = 20 (right-hand plot), with varied domain size c, resulted in only a slightly loss of performance. This, however, is not true for the Spl solution, for example, in which the MS Eavg increased much more in order of magnitude than our RS+FD solution.\nComparison with existing solutions. From our experiments, one can notice that the Spl solution always resulted in more estimation error (i.e., higher MS Eavg) than our RS+FD solution and than the Smp solution, which is in accordance with other works [166, 83, 108, 215, 239]. Besides, our RS+FD[GRR], RS+FD[OUE-z], and RS+FD[ADP] protocols achieve smaller estimation error (i.e., lower MS Eavg) or nearly the same MS Eavg than the Smp solution with a best-effort adaptive mechanism Smp[ADP], which uses GRR for small domain sizes k and OUE for large ones. Although this is not true with RS+FD[OUE-\n7.3.

EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION 107\nThe results with real-world datasets follow similar behavior than with synthetic ones. For all tested datasets, one can observe that the MS Eavg of our proposed protocols with RS+FD is still smaller than the Spl solution with a best-effort adaptive mechanism Spl[ADP]. As also highlighted in the literature [166, 83, 108, 215, 239] and in Chapters 5 and 6, privacy budget splitting is sub-optimal, which leads to higher estimation error.\nOn the other hand, for both Adult and MS-FIMU datasets, our solutions RS+FD[GRR], RS+FD[OUE-z], and RS+FD[ADP] achieve nearly the same MS Eavg (sometimes smaller MS Eavg on high privacy regimes, i.e., for low ) than the Smp solution with the besteffort adaptive mechanism Smp[ADP]. For the Nursery dataset, with small number of users n, only RS+FD[OUE-z] and RS+FD[ADP] are competitive with Smp[ADP]. Lastly, for the Census dataset, with a large number of attributes d = 33, increasing the privacy parameter resulted in a small gain on data utility for our solutions RS+FD[GRR] and RS+FD[OUE-r]. On the other hand, both of our solutions RS+FD[OUE-z] and\n108CHAPTER 7. MULTIDIMENSIONAL FREQUENCY ESTIMATES WITH LDP: PRIVACY FOCUS\nRS+FD[ADP] achieve nearly the same or smaller MS Eavg scores than Smp[ADP].\nMoreover, one can notice that using the approximate variance in Eq. (7.7) led RS+FD[ADP] to achieve an improved performance over our RS+FD[GRR] and RS+FD[OUE-z] protocols applied individually. For instance, for the Adult dataset, with RS+FD[ADP] it was possible to outperform Smp[ADP] 3x more than with RS+FD[GRR] or RS+FD[OUE-z] (similarly, 1x more for the MS-FIMU dataset). Besides, for the Census-Income dataset, RS+FD[ADP] improves the performance of the other protocols applied individually on high privacy regimes while accompanying the RS+FD[OUE-z] curve on the lower privacy regime cases.\nIn general, these results help us answering the problematic of this chapter (cf. Section 7.1) that for the same privacy parameter , one can achieve nearly the same or better data utility with our RS+FD solution than when using the state-of-the-art Smp solution. Besides, RS+FD enhances users\u2019 privacy by \u201chiding\u201d the sampled attribute and its -LDP value among fake data. On the other hand, there is a price to pay on computation, in the generation of fake data, and on communication cost, which is similar to the Spl solution, i.e., send a value per attribute."

Regarding multidimensional frequency estimates, in Chapters 5 and 6, we prove that for GRR, SUE, and OUE, sending a single attribute with the whole privacy budget results in less variance than splitting the privacy budget for all attributes, which is a common result in LDP literature [108, 208, 238, 184, 88].\nHowever, in the aforementioned works [83, 166, 108, 123, 239] as well as in Chapters 5 and 6, the sampling result is known by the aggregator. That is, each user samples a single attribute j, applies a local randomizer to v j, and sends to the aggregator the tuple y = \u3008 j, LDP(v j)\u3009 (i.e., Smp). While one can achieve higher data utility (cf. Figs. 7.6- 7.12) with Smp than splitting the privacy budget among d attributes (Spl), we argue that Smp might be \u201dunfair\u201d with some users. More precisely, users whose sampled attribute is socially \u201dmore\u201d sensitive (e.g., disease or location), might hesitate to share their data as the probability bound e is \u201dless\u201d restrictive than e /d. For instance, assume that GRR is used with k=2 (HIV positive or negative) and the privacy budget is = ln(7) \u223c 2, the user will report the true value with probability as high as p \u223c 87% (even with = 1, this probability is still high p \u223c 73%). On the other hand, if there are d = 10 attributes (e.g.,\n7.5. CONCLUSION 109\nnine demographic and HIV test), with Spl, the probability bound is now e /10 and p \u223c 55%.\nMotivated by this privacy-utility trade-off between the solutions Spl and Smp, we proposed a solution named random sampling plus fake data (RS+FD), which generates uncertainty over the sampled attribute in the view of the aggregator. In this context, since the sampling step randomly selects an attribute with sampling probability \u03b2 = 1d , there is an amplification effect in terms of privacy, a.k.a. amplification by sampling [25, 43, 118, 173, 32]. A similar privacy amplification for sampling a random item of a single attribute has been noticed in [136] for frequent itemset mining in the LDP model too. Indeed, amplification is an active research field on DP literature, which aims at finding ways to measure the privacy introduced by non-compositional sources of randomness, e.g., sampling [25, 43, 118, 173, 32], iteration [125], and shuffling [141, 149, 184, 202, 224]."

First, an LDP mechanism preserves privacy for the data of the sampled attribute. Second, the fake data generator provides fake data for each d\u22121 non-sampled attribute. This way, the sanitized data is \u201chidden\u201d among fake data and, hence, the sampling result is not disclosed along with the users\u2019 report (and statistics).\nWhat is more, we notice that RS+FD can enjoy privacy amplification by sampling [25, 43, 118, 173, 32], detailed in Section 2.3.3. That is, if one randomly sample a dataset without replacement using a sampling rate \u03b2 < 1, it suffices to use a privacy budget \u2032 \u2265 to satisfy -DP, where e\n\u2032\u22121 e \u22121 = 1 \u03b2 [43]. This way, given that the sampled dataset for each attribute has\nnon-overlapping users, i.e., each user selects an attribute with sampling probability \u03b2 = 1d , to satisfy -LDP, each user can apply an LDP mechanism with \u2032 = ln (d \u00b7 (e \u2212 1) + 1) \u2265 .\nMoreover, we integrated two state-of-the-art LDP mechanisms, namely, GRR [80] and OUE [108], within RS+FD to develop four protocols: RS+FD[GRR], RS+FD[OUE-z], RS+FD[OUE-r], and RS+FD[ADP]. We analyze these four protocols analytically and experimentally through a comprehensive and extensive set of experiments on both synthetic and real-world open datasets. With our experiments, we can conclude that under the same privacy guarantee, our proposed protocols with RS+FD achieve similar or better utility (measured with the MS Eavg metric) than using the state-of-the-art Smp solution (see Figs. 7.6 \u2013 7.12). Besides these utility results, RS+FD also generates uncertainty over the sampled attribute in the view of the aggregator, which enhances\n110CHAPTER 7. MULTIDIMENSIONAL FREQUENCY ESTIMATES WITH LDP: PRIVACY FOCUS\nusers\u2019 privacy.\nIV CONTRIBUTION: DIFFERENTIALLY PRIVATE\nMACHINE LEARNING PREDICTIONS\n111\n8 FORECASTING MOBILITY DATA WITH DIFFERENTIALLY PRIVATE DEEP\nLEARNING\nIn Chapters 5-7 we have focused and contributed on statistical learning with the local DP model. From this Chapter 8 until Chapter 11, we concentrate our efforts on differentially private machine learning. As mentioned in Chapter 1, we aim to solve real-world problems using machine learning, assuming centralized data owners (e.g., MNOs and EMS) that collect sensitive information from individuals for both billing and/or legal purposes. This way, we consider settings applying either centralized DP algorithms (Chapters 8 and 11) or LDP algorithms (Chapters 9 and 10) to sanitize the data on the server-side, which is -DP for users. However, besides sanitizing the data, extracting meaningful predictions is also of great interest, thus, requiring a proper evaluation of the privacy-utility trade-off.\nMoreover, in Chapters 1 and 4, we have reviewed mobility reports published by OBS Flux Vision system [53] and in Chapter 5 we have proposed an LDP-based CDRs processing system as a stronger alternative to \u201canonymity on-the-fly\u201d, i.e., with \u201csanitization on-thefly\u201d. In this chapter, we assume that besides generating mobility reports, MNOs (or any involved entity) could also be interested in forecasting aggregate human mobility statistics. Therefore, in this chapter, we will assume the existence of two settings for privacy-preserving human mobility analytics using CDRs. The first scenario, S1, considers that aggregated mobility statistics are published following the anonymity \u201con-the-fly\u201d model of MNOs CDRs processing systems (e.g., as in [53]). The second setting, S2, considers that besides anonymity \u201con-the-fly\u201d, a centralized DP algorithm (e.g., Laplace or Gaussian mechanisms from Section 2.3) is used to sanitize the aggregate mobility statistics before public release.\nIn other words, this corresponds to evaluating the privacy-utility trade-off of applying centralized DP algorithms to the current anonymity-based statistics. This is the core contri-\n113\n114CHAPTER 8. FORECASTING MOBILITY DATA WITH DIFFERENTIALLY PRIVATE DEEP LEARNING\nbution of this chapter, in which we evaluate differentially private deep learning models for multivariate time-series forecasting of aggregate human mobility data. Notice that while the previous chapters considered multiple attributes, we will focus on a single attribute here, namely, the number of people per several given regions."

            "text": "As reviewed in Chapters 1, 4, and 5, on analyzing mobility data, some studies have shown that humans follow particular patterns with predictability [49] and, hence, users\u2019 privacy is a major concern [49, 122, 52, 66, 55, 38, 56, 103, 198, 135, 109]. Because of these privacy issues, MNOs tend to publish aggregated mobility data [218, 109, 237, 135, 53], e.g., the number of users in given areas at a given timestamp, which, in other words, represents a multivariate time series dataset.\nHowever, as recent studies have shown, even aggregated mobility data (e.g., heatmaps) can be subject to membership inference attacks [103, 198] and users\u2019 trajectory recovery attack [135, 109]. More precisely, the later authors in [135, 109] showed that their attack reaches accuracies as high as 73% \u223c 91%, suggesting generalization and perturbation through DP [27, 26, 59] as a means to mitigate this attack.\nWith these elements in mind, this chapter contributes with a comparative analysis between adding DP guarantees into two different steps of training deep learning (DL) models to forecasting multivariate aggregated human mobility data. On the one hand, we consider using gradient perturbation, which can be achieved by training DL models over original time-series data with the DP-SGD [73, 131, 241] algorithm. This case corresponds to collecting data following the scenario S1 mentioned at the beginning of this chapter and training a differentially private DL model. On the other hand, we consider using input data perturbation, i.e., training DL models with differentially private time series data. This corresponds to collecting data following the scenario S2 also mentioned at the beginning of this chapter and training any non-private DL model on it. We have briefly presented both gradient and input perturbation settings in Section 3.2.\nWe carried out our experiments with the real-world mobility dataset collected by OBS [53] named Paris-DB described in Section 3.3.1.2. In this chapter, we aim at forecasting the future number of people at the next 30-min interval in each of the 6 regions. That is, given X(t1,t\u03c4), the goal is to forecast X(t\u03c4+1), i.e., one-step-ahead forecasting, which is unknown at time \u03c4. Therefore, we benchmark four state-of-the-art DL models (i.e., recurrent neural networks) with the Paris-DB, providing a first comparative evaluation on the impact of differential privacy guarantees when training DL models in both input and gradient perturbation settings. Indeed, we intend that from this study, other\n8.2. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION 115\nclassical multivariate time series forecasting, ML, and privacy-preserving ML techniques can be tested and compared. We invite the interested reader to also visit the Github page (https://github.com/hharcolezi/ldp-protocols-mobility-cdrs), in which we release the dataset and codes we used for our experiments.\nThe remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. In Section 8.2, we present the experimental setup, our results and its discussion, and we review related work. Lastly, in Section 8.3, we present the concluding remarks and future directions. The experiments and results in Sections 8.2 and 8.3 were submitted as part of a full article to the Neural Computing and Applications journal."

We split the Paris-DB into exclusively divided learning (first 65 days, i.e., nl = 3120 intervals of 30-min) and testing (last 7 days, i.e., nt = 336 intervals of 30-min) sets.

And in the end, we compute the performance metrics.\nPerformance metrics. All models were evaluated with standard time-series metrics, namely, RMSE and MAE, both explained in Section 3.1.5. RMSE was the primary metric to select the final DL models. As a multi-output scenario (i.e., 6 regions), we present the metrics per region as well as its averaged values. In all experiments, due to randomness, we report the results of the model with the lowest RMSE over 10 runs."

Notice that this is a quite accurate baseline since, in general, the number of people per region varies slowly by 30-min (i.e., walking people may take more time to move from one area to another).\nMethods evaluated. To predict the number of users in each region in a multivariate time series forecasting framework, we compared the performance of four state-of-the-art DL models, i.e., recurrent neural networks: LSTM [16], GRU [57], and their Bidirectional [17] architectures, i.e., BiLSTM and BiGRU. These methods have been briefly presented in Section 3.1.3.3.\nModel selection.

For each method, we only used a single hidden layer followed by a dense layer (output), since RNNs generally perform well with a low number of hidden layers [222]. So, we searched the following hyperparameters: number of neurons (h1), batch size (bs), and learning rate (\u03b7). All models used \u201crelu\u201d (rectified linear unit) as activation function, which resulted in better performance than the default \u201ctanh\u201d activation in prior tests. Lastly, models were trained using the adam (adaptive moment estimation) optimizer during 100 epochs by minimizing the MAE loss function.

Table 8.3 present the performance of the developed DL models in comparison with the Baseline model based on RMSE and MAE metrics per region and the resulting mean. Notice that the metrics are in the real scale according to the number of users per region (cf. Table 8.1). That said, although R1 presents higher metric values, it does not necessarily mean worse results. One solution could be normalizing the data. Besides, Fig. 8.2 illustrates for each region forecasting results for the last day of our testing set, which includes the real number of people and the predicted ones by each RNN: LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, and BiGRU.\n118CHAPTER 8.

On average, the BiGRU model outperformed all other forecasting methods, with results highlighted in bold. Indeed, for each region, the BiGRU consistently and considerably outperformed the Baseline model, showing the worthiness of developing DL models for this multivariate forecasting task. Similar scores were achieved by the GRU and BiLSTM models with an average RMSE around 1241. The least performing DL method in our dataset was the LSTM model. Extending the architectures, hyperparameters range, lag values (i.e., test with less or more input time steps), dropout layers, for example, could probably improve our models and change the resulting most performing technique. However, we will focus our attention on a comparative analysis of privacy-preserving DL methods in the next subsection and, thus, these possible extensions are left as future work."

            "text": "Methods evaluated. We consider two privacy-preserving ML settings presented in Section 2.3, namely, input perturbation (IP) and gradient perturbation (GP). Thus, we selected only the DL method that presented the smallest RMSE with original data, i.e., BiGRU (cf. Table 8.3). We will use BiGRU[IP] and BiGRU[GP] to indicate a BiGRU trained under input and gradient perturbation, respectively.\nFor the model selection stage, we first start with BiGRU[GP] since it allows defining a range of , which is dependent on several hyperparameters of DP-SGD. For a fair comparison between both settings, we utilize the given range of to develop BiGRU[IP] models too. Notice, however, that in both scenarios, ( , \u03b4)-DP can be ensured to each time series data sample. On the other hand, this also means that the same user may have contributed to all nl = 3120 training samples and, thus, in the worst case, the sequential composition theorem [59] applies. With these elements in mind, we considered\nhigh privacy regimes ( 1) such that the maximum \u030c = \u2211nli=1 i is compatible with realworld DP deployed systems [219].

In addition to standard hyperparameters h1, bs, and \u03b7 (cf. Section 8.2.2), we also included the TFP hyperparameters in the Bayesian optimization with 100 iterations to minimize loss = (RMS Eavg + RMS Estd)e ; the multiplicative factor e is a penalization on high values of , which varies depending on the hyperparameters used per iteration. More specifically, given the number of training samples nl = 3120, we fix the following hyperparameters: the number of epochs equal 100, num microbatches = 5, noise multiplier equal {35, 70, 140, 500}, respectively, and \u03b4 = 10\u22127, which respects \u2211nl i=1 \u03b4i < 1/nl [59].

Lastly, all BiGRU[GP] models also used \u201crelu\u201d as activation function and were trained using the differentially private adam optimizer by minimizing the MAE loss function.\nBiGRU[IP] model selection. We fix \u03b4 = 10\u22127 and we apply the Gaussian mechanism [59], by varying according to Table 8.4 (with their respective upper bound \u030c), to the whole time series data, as it would be done if such system had been deployed in real life. The metrics, however, are computed in comparison with original raw time series data. Because input perturbation allows using any post-processing techniques, we used the same model selection methodology as for non-private BiGRU models to optimize the hyperparameters for BiGRU[IP] models. The resulting values per\n= [0.0650, 0.0399, 0.0357, 0.0317], respectively, are: BiGRU[IP]1 : {h1 = 200, bs = 5, \u03b7 = 0.001993}, BiGRU[IP]2 : {h1 = 275, bs = 5, \u03b7 = 0.001182}, BiGRU[IP]3 : {h1 = 200, bs = 10, \u03b7 = 0.001333}, and BiGRU[IP]4 : {h1 = 200, bs = 10, \u03b7 = 0.000842}.\nPrivacy-preserving results and analysis. Table 8.5 presents the performance of differentially private BiGRU models trained under input and gradient perturbation regarding the RMSE and MAE metrics per region and the resulting mean values. We also included in Table 8.5 the utility loss of differentially private BiGRU models in comparison with nonprivate ones, for both RMSE and MAE averaged metrics E , calculated as:\nU = EDP \u2212 ENP\nENP , (8.1)\nin which ENP is the result of Non-Private BiGRU (cf. averaged metric values in bold from Table 8.3) and EDP refers to the results of either BiGRU[GP] or BiGRU[IP] models. Indeed, Eq.

EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION 121\nseries sample (cf. Table 8.1), it was still possible to make accurate forecasts in both privacy-preserving ML settings with the experimented range of ( , \u03b4)-DP. Indeed, from Table 8.5, one can notice that all differentially private BiGRU models achieved averaged RMSE lower than 1250, in which the worst result achieved by BiGRU[IP]4 is just 2.8072% less precise than the non-private BiGRU model, comparing the utility metric for RMSE. What is more, in both gradient and input perturbation settings, differentially private BiGRU models achieved smaller error metrics than non-private LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU models (cf. Table 8.3). For instance, both BiGRU[GP]2 and BiGRU[IP]2 reached similar scores in comparison with the non-private BiGRU model, with a utility loss of about 0.57% and 0.62% (for RMSE), respectively. These results are highlighted in underlined font, which represents our best results in terms of utility, with differentially private BiGRU models.\nInterestingly, the accuracy (measured with the RMSE metric) of differentially private BiGRU models did not necessarily decrease according to more strict , i.e., lower values. One can note that results with 2 and 3 were more accurate than with 1. This way, in terms of a satisfactory privacy-utility trade-off, both BiGRU[GP]3 (0.92% less accurate) and BiGRU[IP]3 (1.53% less accurate) presented adequate metrics scores while satisfying a low value of , with results highlighted in bold. Indeed, in the worst-case scenario, a user that was present in each data point would have leaked \u030c3 = 111.384 at the end of 65 days (i.e., \u223c 1.7 per day), which follows real-world DP systems deployed by industry nowadays [232, 219].\n122CHAPTER 8. FORECASTING MOBILITY DATA WITH DIFFERENTIALLY PRIVATE DEEP LEARNING\nThe contribution of this research is significant for those involved in urban planning and decision-making [122], providing a solution to the human mobility multivariate forecast problem through RNNs and differentially private BiGRUs. In addition, we point out the research community to the Github page mentioned in the introduction section, in which we release the mobility dataset used in this paper for further experimentation with time series, machine learning, and privacy-preserving methods. The related literature to our work includes the generation of synthetic mobility data [133, 52, 172], the development of Markov models to infer travelers\u2019 activity pattern [137], and the development of privacypreserving methods to analyze CDRs-based data [66, 38, 52, 55]. Besides, the work in [225] surveys non-private deep learning applications to mobility datasets in general. Concerning differentially private deep learning, one can find the application of gradient perturbation-based DL models for load forecasting [165], an evaluation of differentially private DL models in federated learning for health stream forecasting [189], the proposal of locally differentially private DL architectures [179], practical libraries for differentially private DL [131, 241], and theoretical research works [73, 71].\nLastly, Fig. 8.3 illustrates for each region forecasting results for the last day of our testing set, which includes the real number of people and the predicted ones by the following models: Baseline, non-private BiGRU, BiGRU[GP]3, and BiGRU[IP]3. As one can notice, similar forecasting results were achieved by both non-private and DP-based BiGRU models, which clearly outperforms the Baseline model. Lastly, between both input and gradient perturbation settings, BiGRU[GP] models took more time to execute than BiGRU[IP] models due to DP-SGD. In terms of accuracy, BiGRU[GP] models consistently outperformed BiGRU[IP] models for the same ( , \u03b4)-DP privacy level in our experiments. Nevertheless, BiGRU[GP] is trained over non-DP time-series data, which might be subject to, e.g., data leakage [228], membership inference attacks [103, 198], and users\u2019 trajectory recovery attacks [135, 109]."

However, along with collecting time-series data, extracting meaningful forecasts is also of great interest [128]. Thus, this chapter evaluated differentially private DL models in both input and gradient perturbation settings to forecast multivariate aggregated mobility time series data.\n8.3. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES 123\n124CHAPTER 8. FORECASTING MOBILITY DATA WITH DIFFERENTIALLY PRIVATE DEEP LEARNING\nExperiments were carried out on the dataset named Paris-DB from Section 3.3.1.2. First, we compared the performance of four non-private DL models (i.e., LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, and BiGRU). Since the BiGRU model provided the highest utility, we selected it for building privacy-preserving models. Under gradient and input perturbation settings, i.e., BiGRU[GP] and BiGRU[IP], respectively, four values of 1 were evaluated. As shown in the results, differentially private BiGRU models achieve nearly the same performance as non-private BiGRU models, with utility loss related to the RMSE metric varying between 0.57% \u2013 2.8%.\nThus, we conclude that it is still possible to have accurate multivariate forecasts in both privacy-preserving ML settings, favoring the gradient perturbation setting in terms of accuracy and the input perturbation setting in terms of privacy protection. We believe that the input perturbation setting provides encouraging results for adding DP guarantees to MNOs CDRs processing systems, i.e., following the setting S2 mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. Indeed, besides being useful for forecasting tasks, DP would also add a layer of protection against, e.g., data breaches [228], membership inference attacks [103, 198], and users\u2019 trajectory recovery attacks [135, 109].\nSome limitations and prospective directions of this chapter are described in the following. For differentially private BiGRU models, we only provided lower and upper \u030c bounds for the privacy guarantee of each sample in the time-series data. Using, however, advanced composition theorems [59] to account for the final privacy budget for each user was out of the scope of this chapter since the Paris-DB dataset does not contain users\u2019 IDs. Besides, although the developed DL models outperform the Baseline model (xt+1 = xt), there is plenty of room for improvements to be carried out on hyperparameters optimization (e.g., accounting for the overall privacy budget [229]), data scaling, the number of lag values, etc. For instance, some high-peak values were missed by both non-private and DP-based DL models (see Fig. 8.3). In addition, we fixed the number of lagged values to 6 to predict a single step-ahead in the future (i.e., the forecasting horizon), in which the former can be tuned for performance improvement and the latter can be increased for multi-step forecasting tasks.\n9 FORECASTING FIREMEN DEMAND BY REGION WITH LDP-BASED DATA\nIn Chapter 8, we have started to evaluate the privacy-utility trade-off of differentially private machine learning models on a real-world problem concerning human mobility. From this Chapter 9 until Chapter 11, we will focus on our second motivating project (cf. Section 1.2), which concerns emergency medical services (EMS), in particular, using SDIS 25 [9] processed data by Selene Cerna. Similar to Chapter 8, this chapter also focuses on multivariate time-series forecasting but is related to the number of firefighters\u2019 interventions per region (referred to as firemen demand by region throughout this chapter). While there are several examples of EMS publicly sharing their data [8, 111, 158], we believe that more attention should be given to their victims\u2019 privacy. Indeed, the first question one may ask is if an intervention is a sensitive attribute. The answer is certainly yes because EMS would not have been called if the situation had not been severe enough (e.g., cardiac arrest, respiratory distress, ...). While the intention of the aforementioned EMS is laudable on publishing open-source data, there are many ways for misusing this information (e.g., discrimination in health insurance), which can jeopardize users\u2019 privacy.\nTherefore, in collaboration with Selene Cerna, we propose in this chapter a methodology based on generalization and LDP, which allows EMS to properly sanitize all their data row-by-row (i.e., independently). Thus, thanks to the post-processing properties of DP [59], EMS could use and/or share the sanitized data with third parties to develop ML-based decision-support tools. Indeed, our solution envisaged both statistical learning and machine learning tasks (i.e., frequency estimation and multivariate time-series forecasting of firemen demand by region). We invite the reader to refer to Chapter 2 for the background on LDP. Lastly, similar to Chapter 5, we highlight that although we refer to our proposal as LDP-based, this is a centralizer data owner (i.e., EMS) that applies the LDP protocol on its servers, thus, providing -DP guarantees for users.\n125\n126CHAPTER 9.

            "text": "We start by recalling two recent publications of EMS French data on data.gouv.fr, a government site dedicated to initiatives in open data. The first concerns the 2007-2017 interventions of the Service De\u0301partemental d\u2019Incendies et de Secours de Sao\u0302ne-et-Loire (SDIS 71), containing the number of interventions by type and by city [45]1. The second concerns the same type of data for SDIS 91 (Essonne department) for the period 2010- 2018 [111]. In each case, anonymization was done by aggregation: monthly for the first dataset and weekly for the second. Tables 9.1 and 9.2 exhibits five random samples of these datasets.\nFrom Tables 9.1 and 9.2, one can notice that the applied anonymization method is both too strong and too weak. Too strong, first of all, because carrying out one aggregation per month results in the loss of useful information by summarizing the interventions at a cloud of 120 samples (12 per year), for which only a simple linear regression remains possible: it is hard to envisage machine learning with such a dataset - this is true, to a lesser extent, for data aggregated weekly. Then, too weak, because this aggregation per month, or per week, was done in a blind and generalized way: if some cities have a sufficiently large number of interventions, which allows a simple temporal aggregation to achieve anonymization of the data, others conversely do not have enough. In the case of monthly aggregation, for example, there are more than 600 situations where there has been only one intervention in a city in a given month: at this level, the simple 2- anonymity [18, 20] is no longer satisfied, and the information leakage is obvious. Such information leaks are also numerous in the case of weekly data, and anonymization has failed for both sets of data. For example, on analyzing the last row of Table 9.1, we\n1Currently, this data is inaccessible on the referenced webpage.\n9.1. INTRODUCTION 127\nlearn, for example, that in the city of Ballore (FR-71220), an intervention took place in August 2014. Considering that the city has 86 inhabitants, it would not be very difficult to find the person who received help this month.\nMoreover, a more risky case of possible data leakage concerns the Seattle Fire Department [8], which displays live EMS response information with the precise hour, location, and reason for the incident. While the intention of publishing precise EMS data is creditable, there are many ways for (mis)using this information, which can jeopardize users\u2019 privacy. For instance, if an attacker knows that one intervention took place in front of the house of a debilitated person, they may accurately infer that this person received care and (mis)use this information for their own good.\nTherefore, the objective of this chapter is to propose a methodology that allows sanitizing each interventions\u2019 data with DP guarantees while still making it possible to aggregate them and make accurate forecasts. More specifically, our proposal also utilizes generalization, which, first, allows generalizing the precise hour to, e.g., days, and, secondly, to generalize the space of several small cities to bigger regions. Then, besides agglomeration of cities to regions, we also propose that each intervention\u2019s region be -DP, which corresponds to applying an -LDP protocol row-by-row. This way, EMS could share the sanitized dataset containing the generalized timestamp plus the -DP interventions\u2019 location data. On the analyst side, one could, therefore, aggregate the sanitized data through frequency estimation (cf. Section 2.4) by different periods of interest, e.g., daily, 4-days period, weekly, monthly, and so on, which would correspond to a multivariate time-series dataset.\nIn this chapter, we carried out our experiments with a real-world dataset collected by SDIS 25 [9] named Interv-DB from Section 3.3.3. The Interv-DB has information about 382046 interventions attended by the fire brigade from 2006 to 2018 inside their department. Our experiments are separated into two parts. The first concerns statistical learning, i.e., to estimate the frequency of firemen demand by region in different periods using the state-of-the-art OUE [108] protocol for single attribute frequency estimation (cf. Section 2.4). The second part is dedicated to one-step-ahead forecasting of firemen demand by region using daily estimated frequencies with the state-of-the-art XGBoost [76] ML technique.\nThe remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. Section 9.2 introduces our proposed methodology to sanitize EMS interventions\u2019 location data. Section 9.3 presents experiments on frequency estimation of firemen demand by region in different aggregation periods. Section 9.4 evaluates the privacy-utility trade-off of our methodology through training differentially private ML models over the sanitized multivariate time-series data. In Section 9.5, we conclude this work. A preliminary version of the proposed LDP-based methodology in Section 9.2 with its results was published in a full article [172] in the\n128CHAPTER 9.

We summarize our proposal in the following.\nSanitization of Interventions\u2019 Data (EMS Side). From Fig. 9.1, the first step to guarantee the privacy of each interventions\u2019 data is through generalization of the starting date of the intervention (i.e., SDate) and the agglomeration of the location attribute. For the former, we adopt a daily generalization (not so strict as the datasets of Tables 9.2 and 9.1). For the latter, we propose a strong agglomeration of small cities to bigger regions in order to obtain events that are sufficiently representative in number. For example, one can notice in the left side of Fig. 9.1 that a set of M = {m1,m2, ...,m15,m16} small cities are grouped to a set A = {v1, v2, v3} of 3 regions.\nIn this chapter, using the data at our disposal, 608 cities where interventions happened in the Doubs department were generalized to 17 regions using the public dataset available in [113]. The set A = {v1, v2, ..., v17} of 17 regions are: (1) CA du Grand Besanc\u0327on, (2) CA Pays de Montbe\u0301liard Agglomeration, (3) CC Altitude 800, (4) CC de Montbenoit,\n9.2.

Fig. 9.2 illustrates the department of Doubs with the respective cities and their agglomeration to regions.\nUp to now, the generalized dataset might still have unique events for a single day in a given region. However, to improve the level of privacy for each intervention, we propose to apply the OUE [108] LDP protocol row-by-row since it is independent on the number of regions. As presented in Section 2.4, given the original region B = Encode(v) and the privacy budget , OUE reports a sanitized bit-vector B\u2032 where Pr[B\u2032i = 1] = p = 1 2 if Bi = 1 and Pr[B\u2032i = 1] = q = 1 e +1 if Bi = 0. Therefore, the final sanitized dataset (see the right side of Fig. 9.1) would be both generalized in terms of time and space and, besides that, it would be -DP, thus enhancing the privacy of each interventions\u2019 region.\nGenerating Synthetic Multivariate Time Series Datasets (Analyst Side). At this point, we assume that the analyst possess a sanitized dataset with generalized timestamp information and the -DP sanitized region (see the bottom right of Fig. 9.1). Since is a public parameter, the analyst can define specific aggregation periods of their choice (e.g., day, 3-days period, week, ...) and estimate the frequency f (vi) of firemen demand by region vi with f\u0302 (vi) = Ni\u2212nq n(p\u2212q) , where Ni is the number of times the bit i has been reported and n is the number of interventions (cf. Eq. (2.4)). In this context, a synthetic multivariate timeseries dataset will be built with all the estimated frequencies, which is considered as a non-interactive case of DP [110, 59]. Therefore, both statistical learning and forecasting tasks (following the input perturbation settings of Section 3.2.1) could be performed with\n130CHAPTER 9. FORECASTING FIREMEN DEMAND BY REGION WITH LDP-BASED DATA\nthe aggregated dataset, while preserving privacy of the individuals concerned."

The initial transformed dataset has both daily temporal information (the when) and the regions (the where) 382, 046 interventions took place from 2006 until 2018 (e.g., see the right-side of Fig. 9.1). This transformed original dataset will be used for frequency estimation experiments in this section and for forecasting tasks in the next Section 9.4.2.\nMethods evaluated. In this chapter, we only applied the state-of-the-art OUE [108] LDP protocol for single attribute frequency estimation.\nEvaluation and metrics. We considered three different aggregation periods in our experiments. The first aggregation period we analyze is with yearly data (\u03c4 = 13 frequency estimates), which allows at the beginning of a year the fire brigade to better distribute their budget around its centers according to the firemen demand by region. Next, a monthly scenario (\u03c4 = 156 frequency estimates) is considered. And, similar to before, the fire brigade can have high-utility statistics from a third-party company to reorganize budgets and personnel each month. Lastly, a daily scenario (\u03c4 = 4748 frequency estimates) is taken into consideration such that ML algorithms could be applied in this amount of data.\nFor each aggregation period, similar to Chapter 7, we vary the privacy parameter in a logarithmic range as = [ln(2), ln(3), ..., ln(7)]. We use the MSE metric averaged by the number of aggregation periods \u03c4 to evaluate our results. Thus, for each time interval t \u2208 [1, \u03c4], we compute for each value vi \u2208 A the estimated frequency f\u0302 (vi) and the original one f (vi) and calculate their differences.

Moreover, for the sake of illustration, Fig. 9.4 exhibits the estimate frequency of firemen demand by region for the year 2013, a month of 2017, and a given day in 2016, with the three values for = [ln(7), ln(4), ln(2)] (i.e., a low, a medium, and a high privacy guarantee). All three specific dates were chosen at random for illustration purposes.\nNotice that such kind of frequency estimation experiments allow evaluating the relationship between MS Eavg versus data size (i.e., period of analysis) according to in order to find the best privacy-utility trade-off for different applications. For instance, each scenario allows the fire brigade to have a sanitized database of intervention\u2019s region where third party companies or the human resources department itself could acquire high-utility statistics.\nMore specifically, as one can notice in Figures 9.3 and 9.4, estimating the frequencies of firemen demand by region with OUE can be achieved high accuracy for different aggregation periods. Intuitively, the MS Eavg decreases as the data size increases, with a difference of 1 order of magnitude for each aggregation scenario. In fact, this is because the variance of OUE is inversely proportional to the number of users n (cf. Eq. (2.11)). For example, for a one-year analysis, the number of interventions is at least 17333 in 2006 (and higher the other years), while the average per day is just 47 for the same year. For this reason, the utility of the data decreases for small aggregation periods.\nHence, one has to balance the application of the sanitized data. For instance, if one intends to acquire statistics per year, results are very accurate with good privacy guarantees. However, if one intends to apply machine learning tasks to this data (as presented\n132CHAPTER 9. FORECASTING FIREMEN DEMAND BY REGION WITH LDP-BASED DATA\nin the next section), a one-day scenario is more appropriate but with a higher estimation error.

In our case, as 608 cities were generalized to 17 regions, privacy could be slightly decreased (higher values) to acquire good utility for generating statistics. In the literature, common values to are within the range 0.01 \u2212 10 [63]."

In all experiments, we report average results over 10 runs as LDP algorithms are randomized (i.e., the sanitized datasets).\nDataset. There are 7 datasets of frequency demand by region: the original dataset and the 6 sanitized datasets from Section 9.3, which guarantees -DP in the range\n= [ln(2), ln(3), ..., ln(7)]). More formally, each dataset X(t1,t\u03c4) aggregates the number of interventions per 17 regions and corresponding time period t \u2208 [1, \u03c4] of daily intervals. That is, X(t1,t\u03c4) = [\u3008t1,x1\u3009, \u3008t2,x2\u3009, ..., \u3008t\u03c4,x\u03c4\u3009], where xt is a vector of size 17 in which each position represents the number interventions per region at time t \u2208 [1, \u03c4].

Thus, given X(t1,t\u03c4), the goal is to forecast X(t\u03c4+1), i.e., one-step-ahead forecasting, which is unknown at time \u03c4. More precisely, we only used a single lag value, i.e., we used the current frequency of firemen demand by region at time t as an input to predict the future frequency at time t + 1.\n134CHAPTER 9.

In this regard, one regressor per target (region) is fitted using the XGBoost [76] regressor with the parameters: max depth=3, learning rate=0.8, and n estimators=100. For all other parameters, we used their default values. We tuned these hyperparameters through a random search [40] optimization methodology with the following ranges per parameter: max depth={1, 2, 3, ..., 12}, learning rate=[0.1,0.9], and n - estimators={50, 100, 150, ..., 1000}.

DIFFERENTIALLY PRIVATE FORECASTING FIREMEN DEMAND BY REGION135\n136CHAPTER 9. FORECASTING FIREMEN DEMAND BY REGION WITH LDP-BASED DATA\nFirst, as one can notice in Fig. 9.5, it is remarkable the improvement of the scores achieved by the XGBoost models for such complex task rather than developing a simple prediction model as the baseline (mean) assumed in this chapter. In addition, from both Figs. 9.5 and 9.6, one can notice that XGBoost models trained with sanitized data can also guarantee a good utility of the data for prediction purposes since they did not lose much utility in comparison with the model trained over original data. Indeed, this is true for the whole range of evaluated, thus, proving the effectiveness of our proposed solution, which relies on input perturbation allowing both statistical learning and forecasting tasks.\nMore precisely, in Fig. 9.6, it is shown for a given day of 2018 the comparison of the original and predicted firemen demand by region using the original dataset and a sanitized one with the strongest = ln(2) tested in our experiments. As one can notice, accurate multivariate forecasts could be achieved even with a strongly sanitized dataset. With such forecasting results, the fire brigade could efficiently prepare themselves for short-, middle-, and long-term scenarios. For example, knowing that certain regions are more prospect to happen incidents, the fire brigade can better allocate the human and machinery resources as well as planning the construction of new barracks. All of these could be achieved while providing strong privacy guarantees for each intervention, using our proposed methodology.\nIndeed, forecasting the operational demand is one main goal of Fire brigades (and EMS in general) to optimize their services [152, 148, 193, 172, 75, 148, 176, 162, 146, 177, 226, 154]. For instance, in [75], the authors identified that shorter ambulance response time is associated with a higher survival rate and predicted the demand of ambulances to allow their reallocation. Besides, in previous works of our research group [148, 176, 146, 177, 226, 154], several classical time-series forecasting, ML, and DL techniques have been employed to forecast the total number of interventions considering the whole Doubs region, in different time-slots (e.g., 1 hour, 3 hours, ...). Besides, in [148], our group also proposed to forecast the operational demand of two main regions of Doubs and by motive, by slots of 3 hours. In that work, input perturbation was considered through applying k -anonymity [18, 20], l-diversity [28], and centralized DP [27, 26, 59] algorithms to sanitize the original dataset. The main difference between the work in [148] with this chapter, is that an LDP mechanism is used to sanized row-by-row independently, which also permits the data analyst to aggregate by different slots of time (cf. Section 9.3)."

CONCLUSION 137\ntistical learning and forecasting tasks on the frequency of firemen demand by region. Indeed, while there are examples of EMS open data publication [45, 111], we believe that more attention should be given to the privacy of the victims concerned. For instance, EMS should not blindly generalized the number of interventions per month/week and city, as there could be many cases of unique interventions (e.g., see Tables 9.2 and 9.1). Moreover, in a more non-private case, we argue that publishing the precise information about the time, the location, and the reason of the emergency (e.g., as in [8]), could increase the possibility of breaching someone\u2019s privacy.\nTherefore, in our solution, we propose that both the time and the location be generalized, the former by day and the latter by big regions (e.g., we generalize 608 cities to 17 regions in Fig. 9.2). In addition to generalization, we also propose that an -LDP protocol (cf. Section 2.4) be applied to each interventions\u2019 region (i.e., row-by-row sanitization), thus, enhancing the privacy of users. In this chapter, we used the state-of-the-art OUE [108] protocol for single attribute frequency estimation. As shown in the results of Section 9.3, the OUE mechanism can adequately estimate the firemen demand by region with a good level of privacy guarantees for all three aggregation periods (see Fig. 9.4).\nMoreover, as shown in Section 9.4, it is possible to forecast the future firemen demand by region with sanitized data as well as with the original data (cf. Fig 9.5). More specifically, the work in this chapter shows that EMS data, which is sensitive but can be very useful, can be properly sanitized to avoid information leakage while remaining useful for both statistical learning (cf. Fig. 9.4) and forecasting (cf. Fig. 9.6) purposes. Lastly, while this chapter focused on aggregate information, thus, applying generalization and LDP protocols for frequency estimation, the next Chapter 10 investigates how to sanitize the coordinates (i.e., latitude and longitude) of the emergency\u2019s location, focusing on a different problem, i.e., predicting the response time of each ambulance.\n10\nPRESERVING EMERGENCY\u2019S LOCATION PRIVACY TO PREDICT\nRESPONSE TIME\nIn Chapters 1, we have reviewed our second motivating project concerning the SDIS 25 (i.e., an EMS in France) and in Chapter 9, we have proposed an LDP-based methodology focusing on both statistical learning and machine learning forecasting on the frequency of firemen demand by region. In this Chapter 10 and in Chapter 11, following our collaboration with Selene Cerna, we focus our attention on a different problem, which concerns the response time of EMS to each emergency. Indeed, many victims require care within adequate time (e.g., cardiac arrest) and, thus, improving response time is vital. In this context, the location of the emergency is a determinant factor of EMS response time since it defines, e.g., the distance between the EMS center and the emergency scene.\nWith these elements in mind, we asked ourselves, is the precise location really necessary to be used as a predictor of an ML model that predicts ambulance response times? In fact, we still consider that EMS intend to share a sanitized version of their data, such that third parties could build decision-support tools to optimize the EMS service. So, in collaboration with Selene Cerna, we propose in this chapter to use the geo-indistinguishability [46] LDP model to sanitize each emergency scene independently (i.e., row-by-row). In addition, there are many other predictors that may also be \u2018perturbed\u2019, e.g., the calculated distance between both the EMS center and the emergency scene; the estimated travel time, the city, and so on. Thus, thanks to the post-processing properties of DP [59], EMS could use and/or share the sanitized data with third parties to develop ML-based decision-support tools. We invite the reader to refer to Chapter 2 for the background on LDP and geo-indistinguishability. Lastly, similar to Chapter 5 and 9, we highlight that although we apply an LDP-based mechanism, this is a centralizer data owner (i.e., EMS) that applies the geo-indistinguishability protocol on its servers, thus, providing centralized privacy guarantees for users.\n139\n140CHAPTER 10.

            "text": "Ambulance response time (ART) is a key component for evaluating pre-hospital EMS operations. ART refers to the period between the EMS notification and the moment an ambulance arrives at the emergency scene [121, 144]. In many urgent situations (e.g., cardiovascular emergencies, trauma, or respiratory distress), the victims need first-aid treatment within adequate time to increase survival rate [41, 144, 188, 121, 75, 157] and, hence, improving ART is vital.\nOne important factor of ART is the location of the intervention [82, 41, 158, 144, 33], e.g., in dense urban areas, the distance may be short, but the travel time may be longer due to traffic congestion. On the other hand, travel distance and travel time may be longer for rural areas. In other words, the location information is of great importance for the prediction of travel time and, naturally, ART [82, 33]. As also mentioned in Chapter 9, the location of an emergency, on the other hand, is considered sensitive information since it might identify who received assistance and for what purpose. For example, attackers with auxiliary information may correctly deduce that a weakened person activated the EMS if they know that one intervention took place in front of their residence. The attackers may then exploit this knowledge for their own benefit.\nIn this chapter, we propose to sanitize, independently, each emergency location data with geo-indistinguishability (GI) [46] (cf. Section 2.5), which is based on the state-of-the-art DP [27, 26, 59] model. Indeed, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of several values of (i.e., the privacy budget) to sanitize emergency location data with GI and train ML-based models to predict ART. In other words, this is a practical evaluation of GI on a real-world EMS task. This way, EMS would only use and/or share sanitized data with third parties to train and develop ML-based decision support systems, thus, protecting their victims if there are data leakages [228] or if the built ML model is subject to membership inference attacks and data reconstruction attacks [105, 104, 145].\nIn our context, besides the own location, with the exact coordinates of both SDIS 25 centers and the emergency scenes, one can retrieve important features such as the distance and estimated travel time. However, if the location is sanitized via GI, many other explanatory variables (e.g., distance, travel time, city) would be \u2018perturbed\u2019 too. As reviewed in Section 3.2.1, training ML models with sanitized data is also known as input perturbation [32, 31].\nWe perform our experiments on the SDIS 25 preprocessed dataset named ART-DB from Section 3.3.4. The ART-DB contains information about 186130 dispatched ambulances from SDIS 25 centers that attended 182700 EMS interventions from 2006 up to June 2020. To the author\u2019s knowledge, this is the first work to assess the impact of geoindistinguishability on sanitizing the location of emergency scenes when training the ML\n10.2.

The codes we developed and used for all experiments are available in a Github repository1. More specifically, even if the ART-DB is per ambulance dispatch (i.e., 186130 ambulances), we used the same sanitized value per intervention (i.e., 182700 unique interventions). Although in [46] the authors propose two further steps to Alg. 2, i.e., discretization and truncation, both steps can be neglected in our context. This is, first, because SDIS 25 may also help other EMS outside the Doubs region, and second, we assume that any location in the continuous plane can be an emergency scene. While reporting an approximate location in the middle of a river may not have much sense in location-based services, in an emergency dataset with approximate locations, this may indicate an urgency for someone who drowned in the river, for example.\nWe used five different levels for the privacy budget = l/r, where l is the privacy level we want within a radius r. Table 10.1 exhibits the five different levels of privacy, selected similar to the original GI paper [46]. For the sake of illustration, Figure 10.1 exhibits three maps of the Doubs region with the points of original location (left-hand plot), = 0.005493-GI location (middle plot), and = 0.002747-GI location (right-hand plot).

The latter two features were recalculated with the open source routing machine (OSRM) API [35], which only considers roads, i.e., if the obfuscated location is in the middle of a farm, the closest route estimates the driving distance and travel time until the closest road. We also highlight that if the new coordinates of the emergency scene indicate a location closer to another SDIS 25 center, even in real life, it would not imply that this center took charge of the intervention. Therefore, the center attribute was not \u2018perturbed\u2019.\nTo show the impact of the noise added to the Location attribute, Table 10.2 exhibits the percentage of time that categorical attributes (zone, city, and district) were \u2018perturbed\u2019 (i.e., reassigned); the mean and std values of the great-circle distance attribute (considering the SDIS 25 center and the emergency scene) and its Pearson correlation coefficient [7] with the ART variable (Corr. ART). In Table 10.2, we report the mean(std)\n10.2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 143\nvalues since we repeated our experiments with 10 different seeds (i.e., DP algorithms are randomized). Although we did not include the estimated driving distance and estimated travel time from OSRM API in this analysis, in preliminary tests, we noticed that these two features follow a similar pattern as the great-circle distance attribute.\nFrom Table 10.2, one can notice that many features are perturbed due to sanitization of emergency\u2019s location with GI. With high levels of (i.e., less private), the city and the zone suffer low \u2018perturbation\u2019. On the other hand, district is reassigned many times as it is geographically smaller than the others. For example, in the fourth row Table 10.2, when\n= 0.000866, the city is already reassigned more than 50% of the time and the district about 74% of the time. Moreover, one can notice that the mean and std values of the great-circle distance increase as the parameter decreases (i.e., more private). Because\n= l/r, making l smaller and/or r higher, the stricter becomes, and therefore more noise is added to the original locations. Besides, the Pearson correlation coefficient between the great-circle distance with the ART variable decreases as becomes smaller."

More precisely, we compared the performance of two state-of-the-art ML techniques based on decision trees, which are known for their high performance (and speed) with tabular data (i.e., LGBM [76] and XGBoost [100]); a traditional and well-known deep learning (i.e., MLP [79, 69]), and a classical statistical method that can perform both variable selection and regularization (i.e., LASSO [15]). All these methods have been revised in Section 3.1.3\nBecause in Table 10.2 there are low variations (i.e., small std values) on all features that depend on the sanitized location, we ran our experimental validation only once. As detailed in Section 3.3.4, in our experiments, each sample corresponds to one ambu-\n144CHAPTER 10. PRESERVING EMERGENCY\u2019S LOCATION PRIVACY TO PREDICT RESPONSE TIME\nlance dispatch, in which there are temporal features (e.g., hour, day), , traffic data (i.e., indicators from [244]), hourly weather data (e.g., temperature, pressure, ..., from [246]), location-based features (latitude, longitude, district, city, and the zone), and computed features (e.g., the distance between the SDIS 25 center and the emergency scene, estimated travel time, estimated driving distance, where the two latter are from [35]). The scalar target variable is the ART in minutes, which is the time measured from the SDIS 25 notification to the ambulance\u2019s arrival on-scene.\nIn addition, the ART-DB was preprocessed by Selene Cerna as follows. All numerical features (e.g., temperature) were standardized using the StandardScaler function from the Scikit-learn library [36]. Categorical features (e.g., center, zone, hour) were encoded using mean encoding, i.e., the mean value of the ART variable with respect to each feature (considering the training set only). The target variable, namely ART, was kept in its original format (minutes) since no remarkable improvement was achieved with scaling.\nWith these elements in mind, we divided the ART-DB into training (years 2006-2019) and testing (six months of 2020) sets to evaluate our models. Thus, five models per ML technique (i.e., XGBoost, LGBM, MLP, and LASSO) were built to predict ART on each month of 2020 using the sanitized (training) datasets with different levels of -GI location data (cf. Table 10.1). All models were trained continuously, i.e., at the end of each month, the new known data were added to the training set after sanitization with -GI. Lastly, all models were tested with original data. On the one hand, this would prevent having in real-life a sanitized location that would compromise the EMS response time. On the other hand, each time the model is re-fitted (or retrained), the new known data should also be sanitized with -GI. In addition, for comparison purposes, we also trained and evaluated one additional model per ML technique with original data. In this chapter, the models were evaluated using the following regression metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R2, all presented in Section 3.1.5.\nResults for each metric were calculated using data from the 6 months evaluation period. The RMSE metric was also used during the hyperparameters tuning process via Bayesian optimization (BO), explained in Section 3.1.6. To this end, we used the HYPEROPT library [47] with 100 iterations for each model. Table 10.3 displays the range of each hyperparameter used in the BO, as well as the final configuration used to train and test the models."

As one can notice in this figure, for XGBoost, LGBM, and LASSO, there were minor differences between training models with original location data or sanitized ones. On the other hand, models trained with MLP performed poorly with GIbased data. In addition, by analyzing models trained with original data, while the smaller RMSE for LASSO is about 5.65, for more complex ML-based models, RMSE is less than 5.6, achieving 5.54 with XGBoost and LGBM. In comparison with the results of existing literature, lower R2 scores and similar RMSE and MAE results were achieved in [158] to predict ART while using original location data only.\nIndeed, among the four tested models, LGBM and XGBoost achieve similar metric results while favoring the LGBM model. Thus, Figure 10.3 illustrates the BO iterative process for LGBM models trained with original and sanitized data according to the RMSE metric (lefthand plot); and ART prediction results for 50 dispatched ambulances in 2020 out of 8,709\n146CHAPTER 10.

This way, local minimums were achieved in different steps of the BO (i.e., the last marker per curve\n10.3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 147\nindicates the local minimum). For instance, even though = 0.002747 is more strict than\n= 0.005493, results were still better for the former since, in the last steps of BO, three better local minimums were found. Besides, prospective predictions were achieved with either original or sanitized data. For instance, in the right-hand plot of Figure 10.3, even for the high peak-value of ART around 40 minutes, LGBM\u2019s prediction achieved some reasonable estimation. Although several features were perturbed due to the sanitization of the emergency scene (e.g., city, zone, etc), the models could still achieve similar predictions as the model trained with original location data."

            "text": "The medical literature has mainly focused attention on the analysis of ART [41, 21, 30] and its association with trauma [19, 144] and cardiac arrest [121, 157, 188], for example. To reduce ART, some works propose reallocation of ambulances [175, 75], operation demand forecasting [152, 148, 193, 172, 75, 148, 176, 146, 177, 226, 154], travel time prediction [33], simulation models [39, 23], and EMS response time predictions [33, 158]. The work in [158] propose a real-time system for predicting ARTs for the San Francisco fire department, which closely relates to our work in this chapter. The authors processed about 4.5 million EMS calls utilizing original location data to predict ART using four ML models, namely linear regression, linear regression with elastic net regularization, decision tree regression, and random forest. However, no privacy-preserving experiment was performed because the main objective of their paper was proposing a scalable, MLbased, and real-time system for predicting ART. Besides, we also included weather data that the authors in [158] did not consider in their system, which could help to recognize high ARTs due to bad weather conditions, for example.\nBecause most of EMS data are personal and confidential (e.g., location, reason), there is a need for privacy-preserving techniques for processing and using these data. In this chapter, even if the intervention\u2019s reason could be an indicator of the call urgency, we did not consider this sensitive attribute in our data analysis nor privacy-preserving prediction models. This is because, for SDIS 25, the ARTs limits are defined by the zone [178]. Additionally, we also did not include the victims\u2019 personal data (e.g., gender, age) in our predictions or analysis since, during the calls, the operator may not acquire such information, e.g., when a third party activates the SDIS 25 for unidentified victims. This way, we focused our attention on the location privacy of each intervention.\nIndeed, location privacy is an emerging and active research topic in the literature [163, 77, 37, 91, 46, 240] as publicly exposing users\u2019 location raises major privacy issues. To address this location privacy issue, in this chapter, we sanitized each emergency location using the state-of-the-art GI [46] model. As highlighted in [46], attackers in LSBs may\n148CHAPTER 10. PRESERVING EMERGENCY\u2019S LOCATION PRIVACY TO PREDICT RESPONSE TIME\nhave side information about the user\u2019s reported location, e.g., knowing that the user is probably visiting the Eiffel Tower instead of swimming in the Seine river. However, this does not apply in our context because someone may have drowned and EMS had to intervene. Similarly, even for the dataset with intermediate (and high) privacy in which locations are spread out in the Doubs region (cf. map with 0.005493-GI location in Figure 10.1), someone may have been lost in the forest and EMS would have to interfere. For these reasons, using (or sharing datasets with) approximate emergency locations (e.g., sanitized with GI) is a prospective direction since many locations are possible emergency scenes. Indeed, we are not interested in hiding the emergency\u2019s location completely since some approximate information is required in order to retrieve other features (e.g., city, zone, estimated distance) to use for predicting ART.\nWith the differentially private input perturbation setting adopted in this chapter, data are protected from data leakage and are more difficult to reconstruct, for example. For instance, the authors in [191, 98] investigate how input perturbation through applying controlled Gaussian noise on data samples can guarantee ( , \u03b4)-DP on the final ML model. This means, since ML models are trained with perturbed data, there is a perturbation on the gradient and on the final parameters of the model too.\nIn this chapter, rather than Gaussian noise, the emergency scenes were sanitized with Alg. 2 explained in Chapter 2, i.e., adding two-dimensional Laplacian noise centered at the exact user location x \u2208 R2. In addition, this sanitization also perturb other associated and calculated features such as: city, district, zone (e.g., urban or not), great-circle distance, estimated driving distance, and estimated travel time (cf. Table 10.2). As well as the optimization of hyperparameters, i.e., once data are differentially private, one can apply any function on it and, therefore, we also noticed perturbation on the BO procedure. Yet, as shown in the results, prospective ART predictions were achieved with either original or sanitized data. What is more, even with a high level of sanitization ( = 0.000693) there was an adequate privacy-utility trade-off. According to [14], if the mean absolute percentage error (i.e., MAPE) is greater than 20% and less than 50%, the forecast is reasonable, which is the results we have in this chapter with MAPE around 30%."

CONCLUSION 149\nindistinguishability.\nAs shown in the results, the sanitization of location data and the perturbation of its associated features (e.g., city, distance) had certain impact on data utility (see Table 10.2) but no considerable effect on predicting ART (see Fig. 10.3). With these findings, EMS may prefer using and/or sharing sanitized datasets to avoid possible data leakages, membership inference attacks, or data reconstruction attacks, for example [228, 105, 104, 145]. In conclusion, while predicting ART might allow EMS to save more lives, we notice that it is also possible to do so while preserving the victims\u2019 location privacy.\nLastly, on the one hand, this chapter focused on response time taking into consideration the recommended times SDIS 25 ambulances should arrive on-scene (e.g., for Z1 the ART should be \u2264 10 minutes) [178]. The next Chapter 11 proposes a privacy-preserving solution to response time taking into consideration the urgency level of the intervention through predicting if each victim will die.\n11\nPRIVACY-PRESERVING PREDICTION OF VICTIM\u2019S MORTALITY\nIn Chapter 10, we have started to focus on EMS response time to emergencies. In this last chapter of contribution, we continue in this direction from another perspective: Although SDIS 25 ARTs depend mainly on the zone [178], is there a way to recognize or of being aware that an emergency will require priority attention? To answer this question, with Selene Cerna, we proposed a methodology based on ML techniques to predict the victims\u2019 mortality using data gathered from the start of the emergency call until the SDIS 25 is notified. Within this interval of interest, there are data about the call processing times, operators\u2019 and victims\u2019 personal data; the location of the emergency, and so on. In other words, there are two entities we will be concerned with, namely, call center operators and victims regarding privacy. Similar to Chapters 9 and 10, we still consider that EMS intend to share an anonymized version of their data, such that third parties could build decision-support tools to optimize the EMS service. However, differently of a single sensitive attribute (i.e., only location in Chapters 9 and 10), there are several personal attributes concerning victims and operators. Therefore, in this chapter, we evaluated the privacy-utility trade-off of ML models trained over anonymized data using either the k -anonymity model (cf. Section 2.2) or of a differentially private algorithm [120] that produces truthful data output. Throughout this chapter, we slightly abuse of our notation and use the terms anonymized/anonymization for both k-anonymity and DP (instead of anonymized/sanitization) guarantees (cf. Section 2.1). We invite the reader to refer to Chapter 2 for the background on both k - anonymity [18, 20] and DP [27, 26, 59] models."

An important measurement of their quality is their response time,\n151\n152 CHAPTER 11. PRIVACY-PRESERVING PREDICTION OF VICTIM\u2019S MORTALITY\nwhich is measured from the time the EMS is notified to the time an ambulance arrives at the emergency scene (cf. Chapter 10). In fact, shorter ambulance response times are potential contributors to higher survival rates [188, 144, 121, 75, 19, 157] since every second is a matter of life. For instance, the response time also depends on how and by whom the call is processed in the EMS center [84]. For this reason, there is a need to optimize these services and take advantage of plenty of data gathered throughout the years in hospitals and EMS.\nIn this chapter, we consider as interval of interest the period comprising the time where the SDIS 25 call center\u2019s phone starts to ring until some center(s) is notified to handle the intervention or the call ends. With all accessible data within this interval (e.g., victims and operators data, call processing times, ...), the purpose of this chapter is to evaluate the privacy-utility trade-off of training ML models over anonymized data to predict the victims\u2019 mortality. Therefore, there are two entities we are concerned with, namely, call center operators and victims with regard to privacy.\nFor instance, with the raw dataset containing direct identifiers (e.g., names), one straightforward question as: \u201cIs there any operator linked with an increased ratio of victims\u2019 death?\u201d can be easily computed, which compromises the operators\u2019 privacy and can lead to social and/or economical damages. Similarly, one can easily access the reason for the intervention (e.g., cardiac arrest) and use this information to jeopardize the victims\u2019 privacy through discrimination in health insurance, for example. Besides, as reviewed in Section 2.2, even by excluding direct identifiers, both victims\u2019 and operators\u2019 identities are still at risk of being retrieved [72]. Indeed, attributes such as gender, age, and ZIP code (a.k.a. quasi-identifiers \u2013 QIDs) can be combined with public data to reidentify individuals [18, 20].\nFor instance, on analyzing the Vic Mort-DB from Section 3.3.5, considering victims, by combining three available QIDs (gender, age, and city), one can find about 22000 cases with the trivial k = 1-anonymity level [18, 20]. This means, in some cities with low population density, it would not be difficult to find out the person who needed help by knowing their gender and age. Similarly, combining four QIDs considering operators (gender, age, grade/career, and seniority) leads to a similar output with many unique rows. One exception is that there is a set of operators, and each row represents an event of who treated the emergency call. This reinforces the need for applying privacy-preserving techniques to protect the users\u2019 privacy.\nTherefore, in this chapter, we assessed the effectiveness of anonymizing the Vic Mort-DB from Section 3.3.5 with two state-of-the-art privacy techniques, namely, k -anonymity [18, 20] and DP [27, 26, 59] before training any ML model to predict the victims\u2019 mortality. The Vic Mort-DB has information about 177883 victims that the SDIS 25 attended from January 2015 to December 2020. To the author\u2019s knowledge, this is the first work to\n11.2. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION 153\nassess the impact of privacy-preserving techniques on predicting the victims\u2019 mortality. Indeed, while these predictions may allow SDIS 25 (or EMS in general) to save more lives, we notice that it is also possible to do so with anonymized datasets, which preserves both victims\u2019 and operators\u2019 privacy.\nThe remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. In Section 11.2, we present the experimental setup, our results, discussion, and we review related work. Lastly, in Section 11.3, we present the concluding remarks. The proposed privacy-preserving methodology to predict the victims\u2019 mortality (and their transportation to health facilities not approached here) developed with Selene Cerna, part of the results/discussion of Section 11.2 were accepted as a full article [221] in the Transactions on Industrial Informatics journal."

Therefore, only XGBoost will be used in this chapter to evaluate its privacyutility trade-off of being trained over anonymized data.\nDataset. We utilize the Vic Mort-DB from Section 3.3.5 divided into exclusively learning (from 2015-2019 with nl = 149321 victims) and testing (the year 2020 with nt = 28562 victims) sets.\nPrivacy models evaluated. We compared the effectiveness of both k -anonymity [18, 20] and DP [27, 26, 59] models, both presented in Chapter 2. The differentially private model of ARX was proposed in [120], namely, SafePub, which produces truthful data output. More precisely, DP is ensured by sampling, in which the sampling probability depends on\n, and data are released in a generalized form that also satisfies k -anonymity (where k\n1https://arx.deidentifier.org/\n154 CHAPTER 11. PRIVACY-PRESERVING PREDICTION OF VICTIM\u2019S MORTALITY\ndepends on and \u03b4). Also, we highlight that both privacy models were applied only in the learning set and, hence, the testing set was transformed using the final generalization hierarchies.\nIn our experiments, we vary the parameter in the range = [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0] and we fix \u03b4 = 10\u22126 1/nl. With these parameters, the differentially private learning sets were sub-sampled from nl = 149321 to n\u2217l = [24621, 45038, 61841, 76418, 88663] samples and, besides DP guarantees, k -anonymity is also satisfied with k = [62, 62, 65, 70, 74], respectively. Thus, for a fair comparison between the two privacy models, we also set k = [62, 62, 65, 70, 74] when applying the k -anonymity model.\nGeneralization approach. The following (generalization) transformations were considered to anonymize each information concerning the victim (Vic.) and operator (Ope.):\n\u2022 Age (Vic. and Ope.) by intervals of growing amplitude: 10, 20, 40, 80, total sup-\npression (*);\n\u2022 Gender (Vic. and Ope.) by total suppression (*);\n\u2022 Vic.

Eleven models were built. One XGBoost model trained over original data, five XGBoost (input perturbation-based) models trained over DP data considering the aforementioned -DP range, and five XGBoost (input perturbation-based) models trained over k -anonymous data considering the aforementioned k range. To optimize XGBoost hyperparameters, we applied Bayesian optimization [47] (explained in Section 3.1.6) with 100 iterations, with the following specification: n estimators [50-1000], learning rate [0.001-0.5], max depth [1-20], colsample by tree [0.2-1], and scale pos - weight [20-60]. For all other parameters, we used their default values.\nPerformance metrics. All XGBoost models were evaluated with standard binary classification metrics, namely, ACC (accuracy) and MF1 (macro f1-score), both explained in Section 3.1.5. The MF1 metric was also used as the objective function for the Bayesian optimization.\n11.2. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION 155"

For each value of , the corresponding k -anonymity guarantee is k = [62, 62, 65, 70, 74], respectively.\nOne can notice from Fig. 11.1 that XGBoost models trained with anonymized data can also guarantee a good privacy-utility trade-off for the binary classification of victims\u2019 mortality. Overall, the results with the k -anonymous datasets are still close to the results with original data while the results with DP decreased more. This could be due to DP applying both sub-sampling of the learning set as well as the generalization and/or suppression of QIDs to also satisfy k -anonymity.\nOn the other hand, with the commonly used = 1 privacy guarantee [59, 120] that also satisfies k = 74-anonymity, the MF1 and ACC scores of both XGBoost models trained over DP and k -anonymous data had no considerable loss of utility. Indeed, selecting\n= 1 has also been suggested in [120] as a good parameterization value. Thus, considering = 1 and k = 74, Table 11.1 exhibits the final generalization approach for each QID we considered of each entity (Victim \u2013 Vic. and Operator \u2013 Ope.) and privacy model (k - anonymity and DP). The symbol \u2217 in Table 11.1 indicates full suppression for an attribute or masking of a digit (for Vic. City). On the one hand, the transformed/suppressed features limit the data analysis one can carry on, e.g., to find correlation between features. On the other hand, as one can notice from Fig. 11.1, although some features (the QIDs) suffered transformation and/or suppression, XGBoost models were still able to classify victims\u2019 mortality as good as with the original dataset, while providing privacy guarantees for both victims and operators.\n156 CHAPTER 11.

This algorithm is based on the relative contribution of each feature to improve the accuracy in the division of a branch. In Fig. 11.2, the following prefixes are used: \u201cPROBA\u201d for probability, \u201cINT\u201d for intervention, and \u201cVIC\u201d for victim, which corresponds to the features of the Vic Mort-DB from Section 3.3.5.\nFrom Fig. 11.2, we can notice that the calculated variables from probabilities (PROBA - MORT MOT and PROBA MORT AGE) and the type of intervention (type, subtype, and motive) have a great impact on the creation of the models. Besides, the victims\u2019 age and gender showed more importance than the alert diffusion time (INT D DIFF ALERT) and duration of the call. Lastly, in our experiments, operators\u2019 personal data did not show much importance for any XGBoost model, in this way, for upcoming works, we consider not using such predictors as there would be a need for preserving their privacy."

Indeed, in the context of this chapter, for EMS, there are many interests in using ML methods for tasks such as: identifying possible medical conditions before arrival on emergency departments [190], to predict ambulances\u2019 demand to allow their reallocation [75], to predict operation demand [152, 148, 193, 172, 75, 148, 176, 146, 177, 226, 154], to predict ambulance response time [215, 158], to predict the ambulances\u2019 turnaround time in hospitals [216], to predict clinical outcomes [160], to early identify clinical conditions on emergency calls [142], to recognize and predict service disruptions [178], and so on. However, to our knowledge, we are the first group investigating privacy-preserving ML\n11.2. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION 157\nsolutions to EMS.\nIndeed, although the collection of medical data allows investigations to propose improved ML-based decision-support tools, on the other hand, there is a problem with the disclosure of personal and sensitive information. In the privacy-preserving data mining literature, there are few alternatives, e.g., objective perturbation [34], gradient perturbation [73, 241, 131], and input data perturbation [32, 31], that can help to mitigate these problems. This chapter also adopted the input perturbation setting (cf. Section 3.2.1) because it allows using any ML and post-processing techniques in contrast with gradient [73] or objective perturbation [34]. Furthermore, input perturbation is consistent with real-world applications in which EMS would only utilize and/or share anonymized data with third parties to train and improve ML-based decision support systems. This way, because each sample in the dataset is anonymized, data are protected from data leakage and are more difficult to reconstruct when the ML model receives attacks [105, 104, 145], for example.\n158 CHAPTER 11.

            "heading": "11.3/ CONCLUSION",
            "text": "In this chapter, we aimed to predict the victims\u2019 mortality using data collected from the emergency call until an SDIS 25 center is notified about the intervention. More precisely, with all data available within this time interval (e.g., call processing times, operators\u2019 and victims\u2019 personal data, location, etc), we sought to predict if victims will die. This way, the SDIS 25 (or EMS in general) can quickly dispatch ambulances depending on the level of urgency. However, we also take into consideration both victims\u2019 and call center operators\u2019 privacy when training the ML models. Therefore, this interdisciplinary work aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of predicting victims\u2019 mortality with XGBoost models trained over differentially private and k -anonymous data with different levels of and k.\nAs shown in the results, even with anonymized datasets (k = 74-anonymous and = 1- differentially-private), mortality could be predicted with accuracy as high as 97% with MF1 scores of about 79%. These results showed (again) the potential of privacy-preserving ML solutions for EMS, which can be used as a decision-support tool to early identify mortality while preserving the users\u2019 privacy and, thus, help EMS to save more lives. As a result of these findings, EMS may consider utilizing and/or sharing anonymised datasets to prevent data leakages, membership inference attacks, and data reconstruction attacks [228, 105, 104, 145].\nLastly, some limitations of this chapter are described in the following. First, on anonymizing the datasets, there is a clear difference in the type of privacy we provided for each entity. On the one hand, because victims were unique in our dataset, DP and k -anonymity provided user-level [59] privacy. On the other hand, there is a unique set of operators that treated many emergency calls and, thus, DP and k -anonymity provided event-level [59] privacy. Also, we considered an ideal case where the information of all victims in the testing set was acquired during the call. However, this may not always occur in real life, e.g., when someone activates EMS for unidentified victims.\nV CONCLUSION & PERSPECTIVES\n159\n12\nCONCLUSION & PERSPECTIVES"

            "heading": "12.1/ GENERAL CONCLUSION",
            "text": "In this manuscript, we approached several aspects of privacy-preserving data collection and publishing, as well as privacy-preserving machine learning. This manuscript is separated into four parts. In the first part, we introduced the context, the motivating projects, and the objectives. The second part started presenting the data privacy and ML techniques our works depend on. We finished the second part by presenting the datasets we experiment on.\nThe third part contains our contributions to privacy-preserving statistical learning, mainly with the LDP model. In the first chapter of the third part, i.e., Chapter 4, we proposed an approach to infer and recreate synthetic data that provides a precise mobility scenario based on one-week statistical data of unions of consecutive days made available by [53]. The generated and open dataset (https://github.com/hharcolezi/OpenMSFIMU) named MS-FIMU can be used to evaluate new privacy-preserving techniques as well as ML tasks. For instance, in Chapters 6 and 7, the MS-FIMU dataset has been used to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed LDP protocols for multidimensional and longitudinal frequency estimates. The MS-FIMU dataset has also been used in Chapter 5, in which we proposed an LDP-based CDRs processing system to publish multidimensional mobility reports throughout time. We also prove in Chapter 5 that for collecting multidimensional data with GRR [80] the utility loss sending a single attribute with -LDP (i.e., Smp solution) is lower than splitting the privacy budget over the number of attributes. This proof extends to two other protocols named SUE [61] and OUE [108], as shown in Chapter 6.\nWe then abstracted the problem of Chapter 5 and thus, in Chapter 6, we focused on improving the utility of LDP protocols for longitudinal and multidimensional frequency estimates. Indeed, the combination of both \u201cmulti\u201d settings (i.e., numerous attributes and longitudinal data collection) presents several problems, for which this manuscript provides the first solution called ALLOMFREE under -LDP. Under the same privacy guaran-\n161\n162 CHAPTER 12. CONCLUSION & PERSPECTIVES\ntee, our studies revealed that ALLOMFREE consistently and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art protocols, namely, L-SUE (a.k.a. Basic-RAPPOR [61]) and L-OUE (i.e., OUE [108] with memoization), with an average accuracy increase ranging from 10% up to 55%.\nWe start the last chapter of the third part, i.e., Chapter 7, by arguing that the state-of-theart Smp solution for multidimensional frequency estimates might be \u201cunfair\u201d with some users since the reported value uses the whole privacy budget , which is what is currently accepted. We thus propose RS+FD, which may be utilized with any current LDP protocol designed for single-frequency estimation. More precisely, with RS+FD, the client-side has two steps: local randomization and fake data generation (cf. Fig. 7.1 and Alg. 4). With our experiments, we concluded that under the same privacy guarantee, our proposed protocols with RS+FD achieve similar or smaller estimation error than using the state-ofthe-art Smp solution while enhancing all users\u2019 privacy.\nThe fourth and last part comprises our contributions to differentially private machine learning predictions. Indeed, the main goal of this fourth part was to evaluate the privacyutility trade-off of training ML and DL models over differentially private data (a.k.a. input perturbation [31, 32]). So, in Chapter 8, we developed and assessed the performance of DL models on two privacy-preserving ML settings, namely, input and gradient perturbation. For the former, we applied the Gaussian mechanism [59] to each sample before training any DL model, and for the latter, we trained DL models with the DPSGD [73, 131, 241] algorithm. Both settings were compared on a multivariate time series forecasting task of aggregate human mobility data. We concluded that it is still possible to have accurate multivariate forecasts in both privacy-preserving ML settings. In terms of accuracy (measured with the RMSE metric), the gradient perturbation setting surpasses input perturbation. However, input perturbation provides higher privacy protection than gradient perturbation as it might also protect the aggregated mobility data against known threats (e.g., data breaches [228], membership inference attacks [103, 198], and trajectory recovery attack [135, 109]).\nNext, we started to focus on our second motivating project with a collaboration with Selene Cerna, which concerns the SDIS 25 (i.e., an EMS in France). Our assumption is that EMS intends to deploy decision-support systems to optimize their services but only shares sanitized data with the development team (i.e., third parties). So, in Chapter 9, we proposed an LDP-based methodology to allow EMS to properly sanitize interventions\u2019 data. With several experiments in frequency estimation and input perturbation-based ML forecasting, we concluded that interventions data can be properly sanitized to avoid leakage of information while remaining useful for both statistical learning (cf. Fig. 9.4) and forecasting (cf. Fig. 9.6) purposes.\nMoreover, in our two last contribution chapters, i.e., Chapter 10 and 11, we evaluated\n12.2. PERSPECTIVES 163\nthe privacy-utility trade-off of solutions based on ML and DP with a focus on optimizing EMS response time to emergencies. More precisely, in Chapter 10, we proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of several values of (i.e., the privacy budget) to sanitize emergency location data with geo-indistinguishability [46] and train ML-based models to predict ambulance response times. We concluded that the sanitization of location data with geo-indistinguishability and the perturbation of its associated features (e.g., city, distance) had a certain impact on data utility (see Table 10.2) but no considerable effect on predicting ARTs (see Fig. 10.3). Finally, in Chapter 11, we concentrate our attention on each victim by using several sensitive attributes of both victims and call center operators (cf. Section 3.3.5). Our objective was to use data collected within the time of the emergency call until an SDIS 25 center is notified about the intervention to predict the victims\u2019 mortality. Once more, we focused on anonymizing/sanitizing the dataset and, thus, we assessed the effectiveness of both k -anonymity [18, 20] and DP [27, 26, 59] models. That chapter concludes that even with anonymized datasets, victims\u2019 mortality could be predicted with high accuracy and macro f1-scores, which could be used as a decision-support tool by EMS to early identify high urgent situations."

            "text": "The research fields in privacy and privacy-preserving ML are broad and promising. For instance, it is possible and interesting to investigate the following topics in the short term:\n\u2022 To integrate the proposed LDP protocols from Chapters 6 and 7 into the LDP-based\nCDRs processing system of Chapter 5 in order to improve the privacy of MNOs clients.\n\u2022 To investigate how to combine the optimal longitudinal LDP protocols from Chap-\nter 6 (i.e., L-GRR and L-OSUE) and our proposed RS+FD solution from Chapter 7 is also a planned and indicated direction.\n\u2022 For both Chapters 8 and 9, for future work, we suggest and intend to investigate a\nmore complex DL architecture to improve the results of DL/ML models proposed in this manuscript for their respective multivariate time series forecasting task.\n\u2022 Regarding the work on Chapter 10, the intended future works are to extend the\nanalysis and predictions to different operation times of EMS such as the pre-travel delay (i.e., gathering personnel and ambulances) and travel times (e.g., from the center to the emergency scene, from the emergency scene to hospitals), while respecting users\u2019 privacy.\n164 CHAPTER 12. CONCLUSION & PERSPECTIVES\nIn addition, for the long term, we list below some perspectives of the works in this manuscript:\n\u2022 To extend the proposed LDP-based CDRs processing system of Chapter 5 to the\nshuffle DP model [141, 149, 184, 202, 224], which could provide strong privacy guarantees as well as accurate multidimensional frequency estimates (i.e., mobility reports throughout time).\n\u2022 To investigate our proposed RS+FD solution from Chapter 7 on generating synthetic\ndata from -LDP multidimensional frequency estimates for classification/regression tasks (e.g., as in [93]) in two perspectives: performance and privacy-protection (e.g., against membership inference attacks).\n\u2022 To study if given a reported tuple y one can state which attribute value is \u201cfake\u201d or not by seeing the estimated frequencies reported with our RS+FD solution from\nChapter 7. Indeed, we suggest investigating this phenomenon in both single-time collection and longitudinal studies (i.e., throughout time).\n\u2022 Concerning multivariate time-series forecasting (i.e., Chapters 8 and 9), investigat-\ning the data leakage through membership inference attacks of both differentially private input and gradient perturbation settings is also a prospective and intended direction.\n\u2022 Some future work for Chapter 11 would be to investigate a uniform notion of privacy\nfor both entities (i.e., a set of operators linked to many unique victims). In addition, we intend to evaluate privacy-preserving ML models with randomly excluded data from victims (i.e., sex and age) since these data might not be acquired during the calls, in order to assess the models\u2019 robustness. Besides, another prospective direction would be working with the text observations registered by operators during calls, which could be treated with natural language processing techniques, while preserving the privacy of the individuals concerned (e.g., [230, 242]).\n13\nPUBLICATIONS\nDuring the period of this thesis, the author has published the following papers and resources.

To tackle privacy concerns, research communities have proposed different methods to preserve privacy, with Differential privacy (DP) standing out as a formal definition that allows quantifying the privacy-utility trade-off. Besides, with the local DP (LDP) model, users can sanitize their data locally before transmitting it to the server. The objective of this thesis is thus two-fold: O1) To improve the utility and privacy in multiple frequency estimates under LDP guarantees, which is fundamental to statistical learning. And O2) To assess the privacy-utility trade-off of machine learning (ML) models trained over differentially private data.\nTitre : Production of Categorical Data Verifying Differential Privacy: Conception and Applications to Machine Learning\nMots-cle\u0301s : Confidentialite\u0301 diffe\u0301rentielle, Confidentialite\u0301 diffe\u0301rentielle locale, Donne\u0301es cate\u0301gorielles, Apprentissage automatique.\nRe\u0301sume\u0301 :\nLes organisations prive\u0301es et publiques collectent et analysent re\u0301gulie\u0300rement des donne\u0301es nume\u0301rise\u0301es sur leurs associe\u0301s, volontaires, clients, etc. Cependant, comme la plupart des donne\u0301es personnelles sont sensibles, la conception de syste\u0300mes pre\u0301servant la vie prive\u0301e pour se conformer aux lois sur la confidentialite\u0301 des donne\u0301es, par exemple le re\u0300glement ge\u0301ne\u0301ral sur la protection des donne\u0301es, constitue un de\u0301fi important. Pour re\u0301soudre les proble\u0300mes de confidentialite\u0301, les communaute\u0301s de chercheurs ont propose\u0301 diffe\u0301rentes me\u0301thodes de pre\u0301servation de la confidentialite\u0301, la confidentialite\u0301 diffe\u0301rentielle (DP) se distinguant comme une de\u0301finition formelle qui permet de quantifier le compromis entre confidentialite\u0301 et utilite\u0301. En outre, avec le mode\u0300le de confidentialite\u0301 diffe\u0301rentielle locale (LDP), les utilisateurs peuvent sanitise\u0301 leurs donne\u0301es localement avant de les transmettre au serveur. L\u2019objectif de cette the\u0300se est donc double : O1) Ame\u0301liorer l\u2019utilite\u0301 et la confidentialite\u0301 des estimations de fre\u0301quences multiples sous garanties LDP, ce qui est fondamental pour l\u2019apprentissage statistique. Et O2) E\u0301valuer le compromis vie prive\u0301e-utilite\u0301 des mode\u0300les d\u2019apprentissage machine (ML) entra\u0131\u0302ne\u0301s sur des donne\u0301es diffe\u0301rentiellement prive\u0301es."
