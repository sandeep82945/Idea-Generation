Commun., 2023, 59, 13668\u201313678 | 13669\nThe development of novel organic cages, which generally benefits from dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) strategies,7,8 has been raising significant interest in the past few years due to the potential application of this type of receptors in various fields, from supramolecular chemistry in solution (e.g. host\u2013 guest chemistry, sensing,9,10 mechanically interlocked molecules11 and molecular machines12) to catalysis and material science.3\nThe selectivity of organic cages in molecular recognition relies on the establishment of multiple non-covalent interactions (e.g. hydrogen or halogen bonding, p\u2013p, ion\u2013p, ionic, hydrophobic, metal\u2013ligand) with the trapped guest, also operating in a synergistic manner.1 One of the key features of cage-like receptors is their structural diversity and tunability. By incorporating functional groups within the cage structure, these hosts can be modified to selectively trap and release specific guests in solution, making them useful for sensing and separation processes. First examples of cages, called cryptands,13\u201316 were synthesized and reported by Lehn in 1968\u20131969. These systems contained two tertiary amine bridgeheads linked together by three polyether chains. Similarly to crown ethers, cryptands showed a high selectivity for s-block cations, originating from the size matching between the cage cavity and the included spherical guest. Protonation of cages containing amino groups in the framework, e.g. azacryptands,14 enabled the successful recognition of anions in aqueous media through electrostatic and H-bonding interactions. As for cations, also for anionic or neutral guests, the selectivity relies on the complementary size and shape, and on the interaction sites matching between the guest and the cage cavity.1,14\u201317 For systems supposed to operate in aqueous matrixes, the cage design should take into account: pH effects, nature of potentially interfering species, solubility and hydrophobicity of both the cage and guest. In particular, for organic hosts that undergo multiple acid\u2013base equilibria, the cavity shape can dramatically change under protonation, hence the binding affinity is strongly affected by the pH in solution. Transition metal cations present within the cavity, if contributing to the binding, can improve the selectivity in guest recognition and associated applications (e.g. chemosensing, extraction of pollutants from contaminated solutions). This is particularly evident in bistren cages, which can coordinate two Cu(II) cations and an ambidentate anion, as bridging ligand, within the cavity, leading to a stable cascade complex.1,14 With respect to MOCs and MOPs, metal ions here do not have any structural role: their function is mainly expressed in the binding of the guest inside the cavity or in the chemosensing process or, at least, in the synthesis of the cage structure as templating agents. Due to the importance of cavity effects on the cage selectivity, it is crucial that any structural change \u2013 e.g. made to convert the cage into an extracting agent or a chemosensor \u2013 does not affect the internal structure of the cavity and its binding capacity.\nOver the last ten years, organic cages have also raised attention as nanoporous materials for sorption and separation processes. Despite the difficulty of obtaining porous materials from the assembling of simple molecules because of the frequent loss of porosity upon desolvation, numerous examples\nof organic cages with a high porosity in the solid (or liquid18) state are now available in the literature.19,20 These materials, which are generally called porous organic cages (POCs),3,19,21,22 have been proposed as selective sorbents, and have been investigated in membranes for e.g. gas separation and ion transport.23,24 Since the seminal works by Cooper,21 Mastalerz25 and Zhang,26 considerable progress has been made in the development of novel POCs, which are stable both physically and chemically,27 and present high permeability and selectivity. For applications in separation membranes,28 organic cages have been highly appreciated for the ability of discriminating molecules of different sizes, solvent processability29 and film-forming tendency. However, issues such as scaling up and robustness still pose challenges for the implementation of organic cages-based membranes beyond the lab-scale. With the aim of improving their stability in aqueous solution, organic cages have been utilized as monomers and building blocks30 in the fabrication of polymers and COFs, respectively.31 Crosslinked polycage membranes, for instance, impregnated with metal (Pd) nanoclusters, can effectively separate and catalytically decompose organic pollutants (e.g. azo dyes) in aqueous solution.32\nIn this feature article, we present the advances over the last ten years in the application of organic cages (i) as chemosensors or components in chemosensing devices for the determination of analytes (pollutants, analytes of biological interest) in complex aqueous media, such as wine, fruit juice, urine; (ii) as selective (back-)extractants or masking agents for potential applications in relevant processes, such as the plutonium and uranium recovery by extraction (PUREX). Finally, we will provide an overview of the uses of cages in membrane technologies for separation and solvent nanofiltration. The limitations and scope of these systems will be also discussed."

In addition, thanks to their good dispersibility and water solubility, organic cages have great potential for biological applications,35 such as bioimaging and therapeutics.9,36\u201338 For the conversion of a cage-like host into a chemosensor, a mechanism to signal the binding is required.39 In the case of fluorescent cages,40,41 this mechanism can involve e.g. photoinduced electron or energy transfer, (twisted)-intramolecular charge transfer, chelation enhanced fluorescence (CHEF), aggregation-induced/enhanced emission or quenching, encapsulation induced emission (EIE), etc.34,42\u201344 In several examples of the recent literature, the signalling process involves a combination of different and independent types of responses. There are also cases in which the signalling unit participates directly in the recognition process.\nA successful strategy to obtain a chemosensor consists in placing the signalling unit in close proximity to the cage cavity.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Commun., 2023, 59, 13668\u201313678 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023\nThis is obtained, for instance, by modifying the covalent skeleton of the cage, replacing one of the bars with a fluorophore or chromophore. This approach, which has been known for a long time, has been employed over the last ten years in the sensing of various types of analytes: pollutants, biomolecules (e.g. choline),45,46 explosives (e.g. picric acid,47 nitroaromatics48) both in solution (although rarely in water) and solid state.34,49\nA few years ago, our group investigated a series of protonated bistren cryptands50 as potential hosts for the b-emitting 99TcO4 and its non-radioactive surrogate, ReO4 . The pertechnetate anion is the stable form of technetium in water. As a potential pollutant, this radioactive species causes concern because of long lifetime (4105 years), high solubility in water and environmental mobility.\nOur study51 identified the hexaprotonated cryptand 1 (Fig. 1) as an excellent host for pertechnetate and perrhenate in acidic aqueous solution, as shown by the high 1 : 1 association constants: log K = 5.49(1) and 5.22(1) for 99TcO4 and ReO4 , respectively, measured at pH 2 in 0.1 mol L 1 CF3SO3Na (0.01 mol L 1 CF3SO3H). Anion inclusion into the cage cavity was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies on single crystals. The high stability of these inclusion complexes is attributable to the multiple H-bonding interactions (both direct and water-mediated), between the ammonium groups and the guest oxygen atoms, and to the size-matching between the anion and cavity.\nThe protonation of the six secondary amines is crucial for the recognition process. In fact, a partial protonation would promote the establishment of intramolecular H-bonds between the ammonium groups and the free amines on the same cage, which would result in a deformation of the cavity with a loss of selectivity for the guest.\nThe conversion of cage 1 into a fluorescent chemosensor for 99TcO4\nwas accomplished by replacing one of the 1,4-xylyl groups with a fluorophore, e.g. the 1,9-anthracenyl fragment52 (see cage 2 in Fig. 1). This structural change does not interfere with the affinity trend: anion binding studies actually confirmed the selectivity for 99TcO4\n. At pH 2 in aqueous solution, the hexaprotonated 2 cage is fully fluorescent and displays the\ntypical emission of the anthracenyl fluorophore (lmax = 425 nm). In these conditions, a significant quenching was observed on addition of either 99TcO4 or ReO4 to the cage. In contrast, no effects were observed with ClO4 , NO3\n, Cl and Br , beside the formation of stable complexes between these anions and the cage. The quenching by 99TcO4 and ReO4 can be interpreted as a consequence of the higher basicity of these two anions (pKa = 0.32 and 1.25 for HTcO4 and HReO4, respectively) compared to the others investigated (pKa = 7, 9 for HCl, HBr, respectively). A higher anion basicity can actually favour proton transfer processes from the ammonium groups of the hexaprotonated 2 cage to the included anion, with subsequent quenching of the anthracene emission by photo-induced electron transfer from the resulting free amines.52\nEven if cage 2 enables the detection of 99TcO4 at micromolar concentration in water, its application in a complex matrix is strongly limited by the presence of potential masking agents and competitors. This issue was addressed by our group,53 by replacing the anthracenyl unit with the chiral R-BINOL chromophore. With respect to chemosensor 2, the hexaprotonated chiroptical cage 3 (see Fig. 2) was also effective in presence of biological ingredients and sweeteners, absorbing in the UV-vis range of interest, and in presence of mixed competing anions. In particular, the cage proved useful in the sensing of ReO4 , as surrogate for 99TcO4 , in both the artificial urine medium and fruit juice. The chiroptical sensing mechanism resides in a change of the dihedral angle in R-BINOL, that accompanies the binding and produces a remarkable CD response. The participation of the BINOL O\u2013H groups in the binding was confirmed by studies in silico and, experimentally, by comparing the binding constants of cage 3 with those determined for the methylated\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Interestingly, BINOL methylation not only reduced the anion binding tendencies of the cage, but also cancelled its chiroptical response to the guest. Perrhenate encapsulation also promoted the partial quenching of the BINOL emission, therefore cage 3 provided a dual-channel response to the guest.\nIn the literature, there are dozens of examples of cascade complexes formed by bistren cages, incorporating two metal cations and a bridging ligand. In these systems, selectivity is determined by the good correspondence between the bite length of the anion (e.g. the O O distance in OOC\u2013 (CH2)n\u2013COO\n) and the separation between the metal centres in the cage cavity.54 For instance, the separation between Cu(II) ions in [Cu2(4)]\n4+ (Fig. 3) makes this host suitable for the recognition of terephthalate55 in aqueous solution at neutral pH. In these conditions, [Cu2(4)]\n4+ also shows strong affinity for trans,trans-muconate (t,t-MA), i.e. an urinary biomarker of benzene featuring the same bite length as terephthalate.56 This property was exploited by our group to develop a portable device for the sensing of t,t-MA in urine samples. The quantification of urinary t,t-MA, in fact, is one of the recommended methods for monitoring the occupational exposure to benzene, a well-known human carcinogen still employed in the industry.\nFor hosts like [Cu2(4)] 4+, the conversion into a chemosensor is conveniently obtained using the indicator displacement approach. In particular, when an (e.g. coloured, fluorescent) indicator is bound to a cryptate, and a substrate with a higher affinity for the receptor is added to the solution, the indicator is displaced from the cavity and its release is accompanied by a detectable signal (colour/emission changes).34,57 When fluorescent dyes are employed, the displacement is typically monitored using a fluorimeter. However, if the dye is coloured, its displacement can be also monitored using a smartphone provided with a suitable colour-picking application.34b As a matter of fact, the RGB values recorded by the smartphone camera can be correlated to the analyte concentration. This approach was applied by our group in the determination of t,t-MA in real samples. In particular, a solution containing both\nthe [Cu2(4)] 4+ cryptate (2.3 nmol) and the coloured 6-TAMRA indicator (0.23 nmol) was absorbed on silica gel into the wells of an ELISA microplate (Fig. 3). After the addition of human urine spiked with t,t-MA into the wells, the microplate was exposed to a UV-lamp (l = 366 nm, 16 W) and the analyte concentration was determined by recording the RGB values with a smartphone. A good correlation was found between the recorded R-index and the concentration of urinary t,t-MA at the occupational level. In collaboration with Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Ma\u0300n\u0303ez,58 a nanoprobe based on gated mesoporous silica was also developed. In particular, silica nanoparticles were loaded with the sulforhodamine B dye (SRh B) and capped with the inclusion complex formed by [Cu2(4)]\n4+ and a terephthalic acid derivative, grafted onto the external surface of nanoparticles. In this system, the sensing mechanism was based on the displacement of terephthalate by urinary t,t-MA. The consequent emission enhancement due to pore opening and SRh B release was detected using a fluorimeter. Compared to the smartphonebased device described previously, this nanoprobe is less portable, but features a high sensitivity without pretreatment and a low limit of detection (0.017 mmol L 1) in spiked urine.\nOver the last years, the sensing of biologically relevant dicarboxylates in real matrixes has raised considerable interest among the scientific community. Zonta59a recently reported a series of tris(pyridylmethyl)amine (TPMA)-based supramolecular cages, containing Zn(II) ions, able to selectively capture dicarboxylic acids in wine. These supramolecular systems can also amplify the circular dichroism (CD) signal of the encapsulated chiral guest (e.g. L-tartaric acid), thus providing a chiroptical response to the guest inclusion.\nThis peculiar feature was employed in the quantification of tartaric acid in wines, and in the discrimination of different matrixes through principal component analysis (PCA) of the raw CD data.59,60 Zonta showed that the stereodynamic TPMA units in a supramolecular cage are capable of inverting their helicity according to the length of the included guest, thus transducing the achiral information (i.e. the guest size) into different diastereomeric states with opposite chiroptical absorptions. This result paves the way to the development of new methods for the transduction of the chemical information into a chiroptical response.61 A similar behaviour was observed in a flexible and adaptive cage formed by two 1,3,5-triacylbenzene caps connected by three diarylthiourea-based arms.62 This organic cage showed a strong affinity for tricarboxylates. The guest encapsulation locked the cage in a helical conformation, producing a gearing-like chirality transmission mechanism. Hence, the cage became \u2018\u2018chiral\u2019\u2019, generating racemates upon guest inclusion.\nTetraphenylethene-based fluorescent derivatives (TPEs), with a cage-like covalent structure,63 have been widely employed in biological applications, such as for the detection of 3-nitrotyrosine (i.e. a crucial biomarker of chronic kidney disease) in serum.64 TPE-based systems are actually characterized by peculiar features: the propeller-like P/M rotational conformation of the phenyl rings which can be modified by the guest binding, and the excellent photophysical properties due to aggregation-induced\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The obtained host\u2013 guest complexes showed an improved AIE-based emission, a larger excitation\u2013emission gap and a longer emission lifetime compared to the free cage. This molecular host was also employed in the recognition of enantiopure deoxynucleotides in water. The resulting cage-deoxynucleotide complexes showed excellent chiroptical (i.e. CD and CPL) properties thanks to the adaptive chirality of the cage induced by the guest binding. TPEbased triangular prismatic enantiomeric structures,66 with mirror symmetrical CD and CPL signals, showed enhanced fluorescence as a result of both chiral induction and the restriction of the phenylene rotation by geometrical constraints. Changes in fluorescence and CPL, from blue to yellow, were observed in the presence of trace acids (see Fig. 4). This feature makes these molecules suitable for the quantitative detection of acids in common organic solvents. Chiral emissive cages were also proposed as porous materials for the separation of organic racemates.67"

            "text": "The selective encapsulation into a cage cavity allows for the separation of target species from mixtures also in presence of potential competitors. Organic cages can be also designed to selectively facilitate or prevent the transfer of a substrate between immiscible solvents.\nAs schematized in Fig. 5, cage-like hosts can be used as extractants to transfer hydrophobic or hydrophilic substrates between two phases. For applications as masking agents, the formation of a stable complex with the cage is employed to stabilize the substrate in the original phase, thus preventing its extraction.\nIn the recent years, one of the extraction processes in which cryptands have revealed remarkable potentialities is the separation of technetium and rhenium from aqueous mixtures.68 The selective extraction from contaminated matrixes (either liquid\nor solid), in which these elements are contained as oxoanions at low concentration, is very challenging. Within this context, cage-like hosts, such as the metal\u2013organic tetrahedra by Nitschke,6 can give an important contribution. Gale69 recently showed that the solid\u2013liquid (or liquid\u2013liquid) extraction of either perrhenate or pertechnetate from aqueous solution is achievable with an organic phase containing a selective superphane in chloroform. Noticeably, the target anion was recognized and transferred into the receiving phase also in presence of abundant competing species (e.g. phosphate, nitrate, molybdate, etc.). The application of the superphane as extractant was successful even for low concentrations of the anion (ppb level) in the original phase.\nOver the last decade, organic cages with a high selectivity for pertechnetate have also been investigated for potential applications in spent nuclear fuel treatment. 99Tc can indeed contaminate the final products of the nuclear fuel cycle, and interfere with uranium and plutonium extraction and reprocessing. As a consequence, strategies for the removal of technetium as pertechnetate, also based on the direct application of molecular hosts in the extraction process, are of great interest. However, for application in the PUREX process, selectivity is a necessary but not sufficient requirement: the cage must also be soluble and chemically resistant in aqueous nitric acid medium. In these conditions, the cage should immobilize pertechnetate in the aqueous phase, thus preventing its extraction into the organic solvent also in presence of potential competitors.70\nA few years ago, the protonated cage 1 was tested by Tamain as a potential masking agent for technetium in nitric acid medium, in presence of uranium.70,71 Liquid\u2013liquid extraction experiments were conducted on aqueous phases of 1 (40 mmol L 1 in 0.5 mol L 1 HNO3), containing Tc (or Re) and U (0.3 g L 1 and 30 g L 1, respectively). As receiving phase, a solution of N-methylN-octyl-(2-ethyl)hexanamide in isane\u2020 (MOEHA, 1.4 mol L 1) was employed. MOEHA is an extractant for U(VI) and Pu(IV), already utilized on spent nuclear fuel solutions. These experiments showed that pertechnetate encapsulation by the protonated cage 1 significantly reduced the extraction of the anion into isane. In particular, using 1 at 40 mmol L 1 concentration in the aqueous phase (0.5 mol L 1 HNO3), the distribution ratio for Tc\n\u2020 Isoparaffinic solvent.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The application in real conditions is however restricted by the poor solubility of the cage at concentrations of nitric acid 40.5 mol L 1. These solubility issues were addressed by incorporating hydrophilic groups in the cage framework. In collaboration with Marie,71 our group synthesized a series of soluble cryptands containing polar groups (e.g. hydroxyl groups or polyoxyethylene chains) on the p-xylyl spacers (see cages 5\u20137 in Fig. 6). These novel cages were tested in extraction processes, conducted in the conditions employed for 1 (aqueous phase: 0.3 g L 1 Tc, 30 g L 1 U in 0.5 mol L 1 HNO3; organic phase: 1.4 mol L\n1 MOEHA in isane; T = 298 K). These tests confirmed the improved solubility of the cages in nitric acid, accompanied by an unvarying affinity for pertechnetate compared to 1. Interestingly, with cages 5\u20137 (100 mmol L 1 M in 0.5 mol L 1 HNO3), DTc resulted divided by a factor of fifteen compared to the reference without the cage, with an extraction efficiency improvement of 3 times compared to 1. These new ligands were also successfully tested as scrubbing agents, to selectively back extract technetium from an organic phase containing this element and U. For these experiments, Tc and U were firstly extracted in organic solvent (aqueous phase: 0.3 g L 1 Tc, 30 g L 1 U in 0.5 mol L 1 HNO3; organic phase: 1.4 mol L 1 MOEHA in isane; T = 298 K). The collected organic phases, containing both Tc and U, were then contacted with an aqueous solution (1 mol L 1 HNO3) of the cage, see the scheme in Fig. 6. The back-extraction of Tc was successfully achieved: with cages 6\u20137 (200 mmol L 1), DTc resulted twelve-fold decreased compared to the reference without the cage.\nAnother relevant issue, addressable using cage-like receptors, is represented by the extraction of alkali halides from aqueous solutions or solid media. In particular, the ditopic macrobicyclic host by Delgado, containing a dibenzofuran spacer and an isophthalamide head unit, showed potential in the liquid\u2013liquid extraction of potassium halides from neutral aqueous phases into chloroform.72 Among alkali halides, lithium salts are of special importance due to their applications in various areas, from pharmaceuticals to lithium-ion\nbatteries.73 Due to the worldwide shortage of lithium, selective materials and hosts for the recovery and purification of lithium salts by extraction, especially of LiCl from used-batteries, are receiving considerable interest. However, the high hydration energies of both Li+ ( 475 kJ mol 1) and Cl ( 340 kJ mol 1) make LiCl extraction very challenging. This issue can be overcome using ion-pair receptors with strong affinity for both Li+ and Cl ions. A series of calix[4]pyrroles (see the example in Fig. 7) have been reported by Sessler as the first hosts capable of stabilizing LiCl in the solid state, without the participation of a water molecule between cation and anion.73 These systems can actually capture and extract the LiCl ion-pair from NaCl/KCl solid mixtures (containing 1% LiCl) with 100% selectivity. They can also extract LiCl from aqueous solutions into nitromethane (or chloroform).\nThe ditopic cage-like hosts, described previously, are capable of entrapping both the cation and anion, stabilizing the ion-pair into the organic phase. However, in other reported examples, only one of the two ions of the pair is effectively bound into the cage cavity.74 For instance, in a recent paper by Flood,75 a triazole-based organic cage was proposed as extractant for Cl from water into dichloromethane (see 8 in Fig. 8). The high extraction efficiency for chloride is correlated to the selectivity of the cage for this guest. Chloride is actually encapsulated into the cage cavity and stabilized by nine CH Cl H-bonds: six from the 1,2,3-triazole units and three from the phenylenes. This is reflected in the high value of the association constant in dichloromethane: log K = 17. Significantly lower extraction efficiencies were found for more loosely bound anions, such as bromide, while no extraction was observed for iodide. Counter-ions are not entrapped into the cage cavity. Na+ is actually extracted with a higher efficiency than other alkali metal ions, due to the strong stability of the ion-pair between Na+ and the [8(Cl)] complex. Interestingly, cage 8 also showed anticorrosion properties: a film of the cage, deposited on a sample of mild steel, could make Cl inaccessible and protect steel from corrosion. This was demonstrated by immersing the coated steel sample into a brine solution for two weeks.75\nIn the systems by Sessler and Flood, the extraction efficiency was correlated to the binding affinity, and both depended on the stabilization of the anion by multiple H-bonding interactions. This strategy proved effective in the anti-Hofmeister\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle . P\nub lis\nhe d\non 2\n5 O\nct ob\ner 2\n02 3.\nD ow\nnl oa\nde d\non 1\n/1 2/\n20 24\n3 :0\n9: 56\nP M .

In the case of multicharged and highly hydrated anions, such as polycarboxylates, high extraction efficiency and selectivity are achievable using dimetallic cryptates. The modulation of spacers length in cryptands can actually improve the selectivity for the target guest, while the presence of hydrophobic groups on the host structure can enhance its solubility in non-polar solvents. Finally, the strong affinity of a dimetallic cryptate for the included guest can stabilize this latter into the organic phase, compensating for loss due to dehydration energy. As a proof of concept, the [Cu2(9)]\n4+ cryptate was employed by our group76 as an extractant for dicarboxylates from water into dichloromethane, using succinate as model anion (Fig. 9). The water-soluble analogue host, [Cu2(10)]\n4+, is actually known in the literature77 for its selectivity towards rigid dicarboxylates with two/three C-atoms between the \u2013COO groups, such as succinate and fumarate. [Cu2(10)]\n4+ can also distinguish fumarate from the geometric isomer, maleate. The sensing of fumarate in neutral aqueous solution was achieved using the indicator-displacement approach, with 5-carboxyfluorescein as the fluorescent indicator and [Cu2(10)]\n4+ as receptor (0.1 and 5 mmol L 1, respectively, in 0.050 mol L 1 HEPES buffer at pH 7).76 On the other hand, the [Cu2(9)]\n4+ cryptate, rendered soluble in dichloromethane by the hexyl-chains on the naphthyl spacers, showed good potentialities as extractant for the succinate anion from neutral water. For the solvent extraction studies, we employed solutions of the cryptate (0.2 mmol L 1) in dichloromethane, stirred in contact with an aqueous phase containing succinic acid (1 mmol L 1 in HEPES buffer, 0.050 mol L 1 at pH 7). As expected, succinate\nwas quantitatively extracted from the aqueous phase into dichloromethane, as demonstrated by monitoring the changes in the UV-vis spectrum of the cryptate in the organic phase, before and after contacting with solutions of succinate (see Fig. 9). These spectral changes are consistent with the binding of succinate into the cryptate cavity (in 1 : 1 molar ratio), as bridging ligand between the copper ions. The extraction efficiency was further confirmed by following the decrease of succinate concentration in the aqueous phase by HPLC-UV and 1H-NMR.\nOrganic cages as adsorbents and membranes\nBeside applications in solution, organic cages have recently been considered attractive in the condensed phase as porous liquids or solid materials for sorption processes. However, for applications as selective sorbents to be effective, the cages should display rigid framework, shape-persistent cavity and undergo non-efficient packing in the solid state. Porous organic cages (POCs) that meet these requirements have been proposed for the selective sorption of carbon dioxide,21,25,78,79 sulphur dioxide,80 hydrocarbons,81,82 perfluorocarbons83 (Fig. 10), iodine vapours,84,85 and as solid phases for gaseous mixtures separation.86\u201392\nA solid phase able to both capture and sense CO2 was also obtained by polymerizing a TPE-based POC. However, when compared to polymer networks or covalent organic frameworks, solid phases constituted by assemblies of discrete molecules have the advantage of being more soluble and solution processable. Thanks to these features, cages can be evenly mixed with polymers, leading to mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs)93 by solution casting. MMMs \u2013 incorporating cages94\u201396 as filler materials into a polymer matrix (Fig. 11) \u2013 have been proposed to address the orthogonal (permeability vs. selectivity) issue of membrane separation technologies. These MMMs can actually combine the selectivity of fillers with the scalability and permeability of polymers, thus boosting the membrane separation performance.94 POC-based MMMs have been applied successfully in the size-sieving separation of relevant gaseous mixtures,87,95,96 e.g. C2H2/CO2, CO2/N2, CO2/CH4, and in the capture of iodine vapours.85\nIn several instances, the cage molecules crystallize into the polymer matrix, thus producing a discrete particle phase inside\nFig. 8 1,2,3-Triazole-based organic cage employed by Flood et al.75 as a selective extractant for chloride from water (w) into dichloromethane (o). In the organic solvent, chloride is encapsulated into the cage cavity, and the [8(Cl)] complex forms a stable ion-pair with Na+ as counter-ion.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

To overcome this risk, it is necessary to reduce the interactions between individual cages and promote the amorphous packing in the solid phase.\nThis goal was achieved by introducing different and/or bulky functionalities on the cage structures. Porous materials obtained by mixing POCs with different groups at the cage vertices showed greater solubility and solution-processability98 than the individual non-scrambled compounds. In addition, these molecularly-mixed polyimine POCs, embedded into a polymer matrix, could effectively produce homogenous MMMs with improved gas separation performance.\nSolution-processable organic cages were deposited as thinlayer films on solid supports (Fig. 12), and employed in separation processes based on size, shape, and polarity. Films of chiral POCs (such as the CC3 cage by Cooper et al., shown in Fig. 12b), deposited on the internal walls of standard capillary columns, were applied as stationary phase in gas chromatography (GC) and electrochromatography for the separation of chiral alcohols.99,100 When porous solid supports (e.g. alumina, polyacrylonitrile) were concerned, thin-film membranes of the POCs were prepared by\neither spin-coating,101 or contra-diffusion growth,102 and solvothermal synthesis.103 Thin-film composite (TFC) membranes98 were also fabricated using mixtures of scrambled POCs and matrix-forming polymer (Matrimid), deposited onto crosslinked polyimide supports. These membranes were utilized for a range of molecular sieving applications, such as gas separation and organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN).104 As shown by Cooper in his seminal work on POCs, one of the peculiar features of these molecular materials is the possibility to change their porosity (and therefore their selectivity) by switching their crystalline phase between different polymorphs. This property was recently exploited to fabricate membranes for graded molecular sieving. In particular, crystalline membranes of scrambled POCs were grown on a polyacrylonitrile support by interfacial synthesis. The membrane pore size was then modified by changing the methanol/water ratio, and therefore by switching the POC between two crystalline polymorphs. These switchable membranes showed high permeances for a range of organic solvents and high rejection of organic dyes.\nThe good solution-processability and film-forming properties of cages can be utilized in the fabrication of dense films and self-standing membranes\u2021\u2021 of various thickness (between 30 nm and 100 mm). For instance, our group fabricated mechanically robust membranes of a chiral organic cage105 (Fig. 13a), simply by casting chloroform solutions of the cage in a Teflon dish. The obtained membranes resulted homogeneous, transparent, stable for months, and could be investigated through gas permeation and tensile tests.\nThe deposition of selective cages as transparent films on glass or quartz slides105 opens perspectives for their application in sensing processes. For instance, in the seminal work by Cooper,98 the adsorption of iodine vapours by a thin layer of POC (100 nm), spin-coated on a glass slide, was evidenced by the development of a dark brown coloration (Fig. 12e), and of a strong band around 400 nm in the UV-vis spectrum. The intensity of this band is correlated to the quantity of iodine adsorbed in the film. More recently, Mastalerz et al.106 obtained\nFig. 11 Schematized CO2/N2 separation using a mixed-matrix membrane, which contains an organic cage filler embedded into a polymeric matrix.\n\u2021 Without the aid of solid support nor matrix-forming polymers.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Very interestingly, the cage films could be switched in colour and fluorescence, from pale yellow to fluorescent red (and vice versa), by exposing the glass to vapours of either hydrochloric acid or ammonia. Thanks to the chemical stability of the cage structure, this reversible colour switching could be repeated for several cycles without decomposition."

As shown in this review, the high selectivity for the target guest makes these receptors suitable for the sensing of analytes in complex aqueous media, or as extractants/masking agents in solvent extraction processes. Recent studies have also demonstrated the possibility of using cages in technological applications, including as anticorrosion agents for steel.75\nAround fifteen years ago, under the influence of material science before and then of membrane technology, organic cages also began to arouse interest as nanoporous materials for gas sorption and separation processes. Experiencing a range of new challenges \u2013 primarily related to maintaining the material\u2019s porosity after solvent removal \u2013 the design of porous organic cages has followed an independent path from that of the traditional host\u2013guest chemistry. Over the last decade, the growing interest in membrane separation technologies has boosted the application of porous cages as fillers in MMMs, or as film-forming materials for self-supporting/composite membranes. Although for now this film-forming ability of cages has been little exploited in the development of chemosensing devices,106 our belief is that the widespread awareness of the potential of these molecular systems will foster their use in point-of-care diagnostics (e.g. as functional materials in portable/miniaturized sensing devices). The utilization of highthroughput technologies107 in the discovery of nanoporous cages will surely speed up their development, boosting their implementation in solvents nanofiltration, desalination, catalysis,108,109 ion transport and exchange,102,110 technologies for water remediation."
