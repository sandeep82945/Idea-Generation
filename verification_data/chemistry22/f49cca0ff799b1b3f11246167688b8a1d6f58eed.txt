"In summary, we proposed an eco-friendly and facile microvia filling method through printing and sintering of Cu@Ag NMPs. Cu@Ag NMPs with compact and uniform Ag shells, good sphericity and promising oxidation resistance were obtained. The as-synthesized Cu@Ag NMPs show optimal microvia filling property. Using a dense refill method, the compactness of the particles in the microvias is significantly improved and the resistivity is reduced by approximately ~95%. With the combination of the Cu@Ag NMPs and the dense refill method, the filled microvias could obtain resistivities as low as 7.0 and 6.3 µΩ·cm under sintering temperatures of 220 ◦C and 260 ◦C, respectively. The property is comparable to that of the electroplated microvias, and much low than that of microvias filling with metallic particles in previous reports."
