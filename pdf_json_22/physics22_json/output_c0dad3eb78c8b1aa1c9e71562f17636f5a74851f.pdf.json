In parallel with the search for new 2D materials, the formation of Janus congurations of TMDCs has been recently achieved as an alternative technique to tune the intrinsic behavior of already existing 2D TMDC systems. For instance, the Janus TMDC MoSSe monolayer has been practically realized through the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique by replacing sulfur with selenium in the MoS2 monolayer12 and replacing selenium with sulfur in the MoSe2 monolayer.13 Recently, Janus WSSe monolayers have been fabricated through the CVD method.14 The MXY (M \u00bc Mo, W; X, Y \u00bc S, Se) monolayers have proven excellent electronic and optical properties, realizing them potential candidates for designing optoelectronic,15 piezoelectric,16 photocatalysis,17 and spintronic devices.18 More recently, it has been demonstrated that all single layer Janus CrXY (X, Y \u00bc S, Se, Te) are energetically and thermally stable, and display semiconducting band gap nature (in the range of 1.10\u20131.57 eV), have good optical absorption in the near infra-red region and hold a suitable band edge for fully photocatalytic water splitting.19\nThe interest in tailoring the properties of 2D materials has gained tremendous attention in designing novel devices with enhanced tunable functionalities. The vertical assembling of 2D materials via weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions allows for the tailoring of the physical properties of the constituents,\nNanoscale Adv., 2022, 4, 3557\u20133565 | 3557\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

In the typeI band alignment, the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) are localized in one constituent, resulting in the fast recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and hence making them favorable for laser or light emitting diode (LED) applications.21 A type-II heterostructure holds both VBM and CBM localized in different constituents reducing the photogenerated charge separation, making them promising for solar cells and photovoltaics.22 Moreover, the continuous separation of photogenerated electrons and holes in different layers of the vdW heterojunction is utilized for water decomposition under solar irradiation.23\nThe photocatalytic water splitting reaction is driven by photoexcited electron\u2013hole pairs, which are generated in a semiconducting photocatalyst as solar illumination and spatially separated by band bending at the semiconductor surface layer. Water at the photocatalyst surface can be reduced to H2 by photoexcited electrons that reach the surface, while holes at the surface would induce oxidation of water to produce O2 gas.24\u201326 Recently, several efforts have been dedicated to explore enhanced optoelectronic and photocatalytic properties in GeC\u2013MXY,27 Janus TMDC\u2013Janus TMDCs, MoSSe\u2013WSSe,28 MoSSe\u2013graphene,29 MoSSe\u2013WSe2 (ref. 30) and MoSSe\u2013XN.31 Despite these attempts, the theoretical or experimental study of a feasible design of the MS2\u2013CrSSe vdW heterostructure remains unexplored.\nIn accordance with outstanding physical properties and satisfactory lattice mismatch, in the present study, we designed and investigated the unprecedented properties of the vdW heterostructure based on MS2 (M \u00bc Mo, W) and Janus CrSSe monolayers by rst-principles calculations. The mirror asymmetry in the CrSSe monolayer allows for considering two different models of the MS2\u2013CrSSe heterostructure with six possible stacking patterns. The most feasible stacking conguration of both models reveals energetic, dynamic and thermal stability. Finally, the electronic, optical and photocatalytic behavior of the feasible conguration is explored.

            "text": "The pristine single layers MS2 (M\u00bcMo,W) and CrXY (X\u00bc S, Y\u00bc Se) exhibit a graphene-like hexagonal honeycomb structure. The calculated bond length for Mo\u2013S, W\u2013S, Cr\u2013S and Cr\u2013Se are 2.402 A\u030a, 2.408 A\u030a, 2.302 A\u030a and 2.423 A\u030a, respectively. Also, the optimized lattice constant (band gap) values for parent MoS2, WS2 and CrSSe monolayers are 3.16 A\u030a (2.01 eV), 3.15 A\u030a (1.95 eV) and 3.13 A\u030a (2.11 eV), respectively. These results are consistent with previously available theoretical and experimental literature43\u201351 and conrm our theoretical approach for the study of TMDCs and Janus CrSSe monolayers.\nIn general, the orientation of contacted atoms in individual layers or local congurations strongly affects the interfacial properties of the heterostructures. Since the lattice mismatch between Mo(W)S2 and CrSSe monolayers is 0.95 (0.63) %, the MS2 and CrSSe monolayers exhibit a satisfactory lattice mismatch, revealing the experimental construction of MS2\u2013 CrSSe heterostructures through van der Waals (vdW) interaction. As Janus CrSSe with mirror asymmetry possesses different chalcogen (X/Y) atoms, we consider two different models (model-I and model-II) with alternate chalcogen atoms at the opposite surface of single layer CrSSe placed above the MS2 monolayer to construct the MS2\u2013CrSSe vdW-heterobilayer system, as displayed in Fig. 1(i). For each model, six possible congurations with different orientations of corresponding chalcogen or transition metal atoms in the MS2\u2013CrSSe heterobilayer system are presented in Fig. 1(ii). In Fig. 1(ii); conguration a(b), the Se(Cr)-atom in CrSSe is localized on top of the Satom in MoS2 and the Cr(Se)-atom occupies the position on top of the Mo-atom. Conguration c(d), Se-atom is positioned on top of the S(Mo)-atom with Mo(S)-atom localized on the hollow site. Conguration e(f), Cr-atom is located on top of Mo(S)-atom and S(Mo) occupies the hollow site. A similar trend of possible congurations with alternate orders of Se and S atoms in CrSSe is followed in model-II; hence, only model-I is discussed in detail here.\nTo further conrm the energetic stability of the most feasible conguration, the binding energy is calculated for each conguration of both models of MS2\u2013CrSSe vdW heterostructures. The binding energy is dened as:\nEb \u00bc Ehetero ETMDC ECrSSe\nwhere Eb shows the binding energy of the system, Ehetero, ETMDC and ECrSSe represent the total energy of MS2\u2013CrSSe, isolated MS2\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The calculated lattice constants, bond length, binding energy (Eb) and interlayer spacing (d) of the most feasible conguration for model-I and model-II are presented in Table 1. It is clear from Table 1 that an increase/decrease in the bond length of the Mo(W)S2/CrSSe system indicates intrinsic tensile/compressive strain in Mo(W) S2/CrSSe, respectively. The calculated intrinsic compressive/ tensile strain are 0.47%/0.48% for MoS2/CrSSe in MoS2\u2013CrSSe and 0.32%/0.32% for WS2/CrSSe in WS2\u2013CrSSe, which is attributed to vdW interactions between Mo(W)S2 and CrSSe vertically stacked systems. Evidently, the disparity of local congurations leads to different magnitudes of binding energy and corresponding distance between the layers. The smaller interlayer spacing of the conguration (b) of both models reveals energetic stability and tailors the physical behavior of MS2 (M \u00bc Mo, W) and CrSSe monolayers.\nTo assess the dynamical stability of MS2\u2013CrSSe heterobilayers, the phonon band spectra is calculated using the phonopy code, as shown in Fig. 2. There are six atoms per primitive unit cell therefore, each phonon band dispersion is composed of three acoustic zero frequency modes and 15 optical branches. As it is clear from Fig. 2 that all phonon modes with positive eigenfrequencies at the G-point of the Brillouin zone indicates\ndynamical stability of MS2\u2013CrSSe heterobilayers. This conrms the synthesis of all MS2\u2013CrSSe heterobilayers. Further, the thermal stability of a material is important to study the molecular vibrations or uctuation in energy with time at different temperatures.52,53 The thermal stability of MS2\u2013CrSSe systems, presented in Fig. 3(a\u2013d), is carried out by performing ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations. Since it determines the amount of energy per vibrational degree of freedom and the oscillation amplitudes are dependent on the temperature. Both models of MS2\u2013CrSSe systems comprise pure harmonic oscillators, revealing no prominent change in the energy spectra, as shown in Fig. 3(a\u2013d). This indicates the absence of broken bonds or the reconstruction of geometric structures aer heating the system at 300 K for 3000 fs, hence conrming the thermodynamical stability of the MS2\u2013CrSSe systems. This behavior has also been demonstrated in P\u2013SiS, P\u2013 SiC and P-Janus structures.54\nIn general, the electronic properties of 2D materials can be modulated by the interaction between the stacked monolayers. The electronic band structure of MS2\u2013CrSSe systems is investigated using PBE and HSE06 functionals, as displayed in Fig. 4(a\u2013d). All understudy systems possess an indirect band gap semiconducting nature with the valence band maximum (VBM) located at K-point and the conduction band maximum (CBM) found at G-point of the Brillouin zone. In this case, the excited electrons could jump from the valence band to the conduction band at K-point and then the holes move from G-point, which can effectively retard the combination of photogenerated electrons and holes and enhance the photocatalytic performance55 TMDCs.56,57 This is consistent with other 2D In2X3 (X\u00bc S, Se, Te) monolayers58 and Nb2XTe4.59 The band gap values of MS2\u2013CrSSe (model-I and model-II) systems using PBE and HSE06 functionals are listed in Table 1. Evidently, an enlarged band gap value using the HSE06 level can be seen. This trend has been demonstrated in GeC\u2013MS2 and SiC\u2013MX2 systems.24,60,61 Further, the MS2\u2013CrSSe vdW heterostructures with indirect type-I band gaps are comparatively more promising for photodetectors and photocatalysis as compared to MX2\u2013Zr2CO2,62 PbI2\u2013a-Te63 and GaS\u2013g-C3N4 (ref. 64) vdWs heterostructures.\nIn order to illuminate the orbital character for understanding the nature of the band alignment of heterostructures, the weighted band structure of all heterobilayers is calculated, as displayed in Fig. 5.

It is evident from Fig. 5(a\u2013d) that both VBM and CBM are localized in the CrSSe monolayer of the studied systems, indicating the type-I band alignment in MS2\u2013CrSSe heterobilayers. The formation of the type-I band alignment is crucial for lasers or light emitting diodes (LEDs) applications.65 A similar trend of type-I band alignment has been theoretically demonstrated in\n3560 | Nanoscale Adv., 2022, 4, 3557\u20133565\nZnO\u2013JTMDC, phosphorene\u2013ZrSSe, and WSSe\u2013WX2 (ref. 66\u201368) and experimentally reported in MoS2\u2013PbI2.69\nThe absence of mirror-symmetry in Janus 2D materials results in different polarization effects, which helps to understand the intrinsic electronic and extrinsic photocatalytic behavior of the materials.70\u201373 The plane-averaged electrostatic potential of all MS2\u2013CrSSe heterobilayers for both models is calculated and plotted in Fig. 6(a\u2013d).

The calculated work function of understudy heterobilayers is comparatively smaller than the work functions of corresponding parent monolayers (5.15 eV (MoS2), 4.09 eV (WS2) and 5.24 eV (CrSSe) reported in ref. 23 and 38) and leads to strong interfacial interaction. In models-I, electrons may transfer from MoS2(WS2) with deeper potential to CrSSe with a lower potential, forming a built-in electric eld at the interface with a potential drop of 0.46 eV(0.07 eV). Similarly, the potential drop (DV) for MoS2(WS2)\u2013 CrSeS is 0.14 eV(0.57 eV), which is consistent with C4N\u2013MoS2.74 The built-in electric eld formed at the interfacemoves from the MS2 (M \u00bc Mo, W) layer to the CrSSe layer for both model-I and model-II. Further, the charge density difference (Dr \u00bc rMS2\u2013CrSSe rMS2 rCrSSe) of the MS2\u2013CrSSe system is calculated to address the interlayer charge transfer, as plotted in Fig. 6(e and f). Here, rMS2\u2013CrSSe, rMS2 and rCrSSe represent the charge density of MS2\u2013CrSSe, MS2 and CrSSe systems, respectively. In Fig. 6(e and f), the gain and loss of electrons are represented by yellow and cyan colors, respectively. It can be easily seen that MS2 depletes charges and the CrSSe layer accumulates charges. However, the main charge redistribution occurs in the interfacial region between chalcogen atoms of the individual layers, indicating a built-in electric eld in the interfacial region. In both models, MS2\u2013CrSSe heterobilayers exhibit the same character of charge transfer; hence, Dr is plotted only for model-I of the Mo(W)S2\u2013CrSSe system (Fig. 6(e and f)). This identies that P-type doping occurs in MS2 monolayers. Moreover, the Bader charge analysis reveals that an amount of 0.0005e (0.0025e) is driven from MoS2 to CrSSe in model-I (model-II) and 0.0089e (0.0021e) is donated by WS2 to CrSSe in model-I (model-II). Interestingly, charge transfer in model-I (model-II) is responsible for stronger electronic inuence in the WS2 (MoS2) monolayer.\nThe optical response of materials to incident solar light is crucial in identifying the promising materials for the water\nFig. 7 The absorption spectra of (a\u2013d) MS2\u2013CrSSe heterostructures.\n3562 | Nanoscale Adv., 2022, 4, 3557\u20133565\nsplitting mechanism. The optical parameter particularly the imaginary part of the dielectric function 32(u) of understudy systems is calculated to understand the transition between the occupied and unoccupied states, as displayed in Fig. 7(a\u2013d). The electronic band structure is modied in the MS2\u2013CrSSe system due to the weak coupling and interlayer charge transfer between the pristine monolayers. Moreover, the excitons dominate the optical transition from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) in all understudy heterostructures. Interestingly, the excitonic transition occurs in the range of 1.07\u20131.60 eV for MoS2\u2013CrSSe, 2.05\u20132.80 eV for WS2\u2013CrSSe, 2.01\u20132.80 eV for MoS2\u2013CrSeS and 3.0\u20133.5 eV for WS2\u2013CrSeS. In contrast to pristine monolayers, a red-shi is evidently observed in the optical absorption spectra of MS2\u2013CrSSe, highlighting them as potential candidates for optoelectronic devices to capture the visible solar spectrum. Other 2D materials have followed the same trend.75\u201378\nTo explore water dissociation into hydrogen production under solar irradiation, the valence band (VB) edge and conduction band (CB) edge position align with the standard reduction (H+/H2) and oxidation (O2/H2O) potentials of water dissociation are calculated at pH \u00bc 0 using the HSE06 level, as displayed in Fig. 8. In general, the standard potentials for the redox reactions of water splitting are as follows Ered (H\n+/H2) \u00bc 4.44 eV + pH 0.059 eV and EOx (O2/H2O) \u00bc 5.67 eV + pH 0.059 eV.79 In photocatalysis, photogenerated electrons and holes are separated and transported to H+/H2 or to O2 molecules. For the water splitting reaction, the photocatalyst should possess a semiconducting band gap with a value greater than 1.23 eV. Evidently, for W(Mo)S2\u2013CrSSe of model-I(II), the valence band (VB) edge is found above the oxidation potential and the conduction band (CB) edge fails to reside above the reduction potential. In contrast, for other Mo(W)S2\u2013CrSSe systems of model-I(II), the CBM lies higher than the reduction potential ( 4.50 eV) and the VBM is located lower than the oxidation potential ( 5.70 eV). This exciting trend of the band edge position has been demonstrated for other materials.80,81 Hence, both VB and CB edges straddle the redox potentials,\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

            "text": "To summarize, we theoretically investigated the structural, electronic, optical and photocatalytic behavior of two different models of MS2\u2013CrSSe (M \u00bc Mo, W) heterostructures by performing the density functional theory calculations. The feasible binding energy, absence of imaginary frequencies in phonon branches and no considerable uctuation of the energy curve at room temperature verify the energetic and dynamical stability of all understudy heterobilayers. All MS2\u2013CrSSe (M \u00bc Mo, W) systems possess an indirect type-I band alignment with VBM and CBM localized in the CrSSe layer, indicating the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes in the CrSSe layer, hence making them suitable for light detection applications. The broadening of light absorption in the visible region coupled with red-shi in absorption spectra reveals MS2\u2013CrSSe systems promising for light conversion purposes. TheMo(W)S2\u2013CrSSe of model-I(II) heterobilayers are capable of performing redox reactions of water splitting under solar irradiation, whereas the WS2(MoS2)\u2013CrSSe system of model-I(II) fails to perform redox reactions. These ndings lead to the practical utilization of MS2\u2013CrSSe systems in future optoelectronic and photocatalytic water splitting applications."
