    "abstractText": "Traditional medicine shows several treatment protocols for COVID-19 based on natural products, revealing its potential as a possible source of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. Ampelozizyphus amazonicus is popularly used in the Brazilian Amazon as a fortifier and tonic, and recently, it has been reported to relieve COVID-19 symptoms. This work aimed to investigate the antiviral potential of A. amazonicus, focusing on the inhibition of spike and ACE2 receptor interaction, a key step in successful infection. Although saponins are the major compounds of this plant and often reported as its active principles, a polyphenol-rich extract was the best inhibitor of the spike and ACE2 interaction. Chemical characterization of A. amazonicus bark extracts by LC-DAD-APCI-MS/MS before and after clean-up steps for polyphenol removal showed that the latter play an essential role in maintaining this activity. The effects of the extracts on viral replication were also assessed, and all samples (aqueous and ethanol extracts) demonstrated in vitro activity, inhibiting viral titers in the supernatant of Calu-3 cells after 24 hpi. By acting both in the SARS-CoV-2 cell entry process and its replication, A. amazonicus bark extracts stand out as a multitarget agent, highlighting the species as a promising candidate in the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.",

SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3159. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28073159 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3159 2 of 19\nvirus with a 27\u201332 kb-long genome [2,3], which is divided into two open reading frames (ORFs) that encode non-structural proteins and subgenomic RNAs that encode the structural proteins [4,5]. Like other enveloped viruses, coronaviruses have unique proteins responsible for the recognition of and binding to host cell receptors [6,7]. The spike protein (SP) has 180 to 200 kDa and is a structural glycoprotein present in all coronaviruses and which is formed by a signal peptide and two subunits: S1, which contains the receptor binding domain (RBD), and S2, in which the fusion peptide is present [8,9]. They are found in the homotrimeric form, as a crown-like ornamentation around the viral particle, which gave the name to this group of viruses [9]. In the viral particle, SP exists in its pre-fusional conformation, and its specific cleavage is mandatory to trigger the conformational change that leads to viral and cellular membrane fusion [9,10]. Two possible entry pathways into host cells have already been described, and both start with the recognition and binding of SP RBD to its major ligand, the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [9,10]. Although the vaccine arsenal is widely available to the population and complete vaccination clearly reduces severe cases, it is still imperative to consider mild and moderate infections, whose needs are currently unmet. Controlling non-severe cases will help to reduce the viral spread and reduce the social and economic impact of COVID-19. Therefore, investments in new therapeutic approaches are welcome. Since the pandemic\u2019s beginning, natural products\u2019 relevance as a potential source of active compounds in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 has exponentially grown, and records in the literature show how these substances represent a promising approach. Plants\u2019 secondary metabolites, such as saponins, terpenes, alkaloids, and phenolic acids, have been shown to display antiviral activity against several specimens of the Coronaviridae family [11\u201313]. To date, a few works have described several representatives from different classes of natural products, such as flavonoids and alkaloids, that clearly exhibit a promising activity against SARS-CoV-2 [14\u201317], reinforcing the necessity of continued efforts to find potential alternatives to be used in the clinical management of mild and moderate COVID-19 cases. In 2020, a great number of in silico studies emerged as an alternative to evaluate natural products\u2019 ability to act as protease, helicase, and replicase inhibitors, especially because of the limited infrastructure to manipulate SARS-CoV-2. In silico analyses provided valuable and reliable information on a range of substances with potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in a relatively short time; these are currently being tested in in vitro and in vivo assays [18\u201322]. Despite viral enzymatic inhibition being the main mechanism of action for most of the currently available and in development antivirals, blockage of SP interaction with ACE2 is becoming an attractive approach for a new generation of antivirals since it has the potential to hamper viral recognition and infection of host cells, preventing viral propagation inside the organism as well as contributing to a reduced mutation rate and thus the appearance of new variants [23]. Lately, in vitro methodologies using isolated viral components have gained space in an attempt to increase the rate of the discovery of potential inhibitors, whether they come from natural or synthetic sources. Some of the technologies used for this purpose include pseudoviruses to investigate the cell entry process, FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) assays to evaluate enzymatic activity, and colorimetric or luminescent assays to evaluate protein interactions [24]. As part of a broader ongoing screening project on natural inhibitors of the interaction between SP and ACE2, a library of plant extracts belonging to Brazilian biome biodiversity (in the Amazon, Atlantic Forest, and Cerrado region) was evaluated, from which the extracts from A. amazonicus Ducke stood out as the most promising. A. amazonicus is one of 984 species of the Rhamnaceae Juss. family [25], which is endemic to the Amazonian states of South America; its distribution includes the regions of Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Brazil [26\u201328]. The bark and roots of the plant, popularly known as \u201ccerveja de indio\u201d or \u201csaracura-mir\u00e1\u201d, have been used in Brazil for over 30 years by the Amazonian traditional communities to prepare a drink with\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3159 3 of 19\nstimulant, tonic and fortifying properties to combat and prevent malaria, among other uses [29]. Studies with a spray-dried aqueous bark extract of the plant have demonstrated its properties as an immune enhancer and adaptogen [30,31]. More recently, the species has been recorded as being used for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 by the Sater\u00e9 Maw\u00e9 indigenous people, as well as by riverine communities in the Brazilian Amazon during the pandemic [32]. Reports on the chemical composition of the plant focus basically on its triterpenes and saponins, which are believed to be responsible for the wide range of biological activities reported for the species [29\u201331,33\u201335]. In fact, aqueous extracts prepared from the plant produce abundant foaming, due to the presence of up to 48% of saponins [31,33], which explains one of the popular names \u201ccerveja de indio\u201d which means \u201cIndian beer\u201d. However, although never studied, phenolic compounds are also present in these plant extracts, especially ethanol compounds (personal observations). Since the literature shows the potential of A. amazonicus as a source of useful compounds for the attenuation of COVID-19 symptoms, we aimed in the present study to evaluate the potential of its chemically characterized bark extracts to inhibit the receptorbinding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2 interaction before and after clean-up steps with lead acetate for the removal of phenolics, and to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro."

Results and Discussion 2.1. A. amazonicus Extracts Inhibit at Least Half of RBD:ACE2 Complex Formation In Vitro\nThe ability of four different extracts of A. amazonicus to interfere in the formation of RDB:ACE2 complex was assessed with the aid of a Lumit\u2122 kit (Promega), a no-wash, add-and-read bioluminescence-based kit suitable for the trial of potential inhibitory samples [36].The tested samples included two aqueous extracts prepared according to traditional medicine, which were previously shown to have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties [30,31], and two ethanol extracts obtained according to the literature [34,35].

Clean-Up Procedure with Lead Acetate Removes Phenolic Compounds and Promotes Differences in Biological Activity\nTaking into account the results of the inhibition rates of the formation of the RBD:ACE2 complex by A. amazonicus extracts (Figure 1), and their chemical characterization by mass spectrometry showing a similar saponin profile, a clean-up step on the most active ethanol extract (#76) was performed to separate the UV-absorbing compounds (probably phenolic) from the saponins, aiming to identify whether they could be responsible for the enhanced activity of this extract.

These data are the result of two independent duplicates. Multiple t-tests between concentrations of each extract showed a significant statistical difference (p-value < 0.05). #76 R2 = 0.92. #76_Pb R2 = 0.81.\nThe data show that extract #76 interferes in the RBD:ACE2 complex formation in all concentrations tested (25 to 125 \u00b5g.mL\u22121), reducing the interaction by at least 40% in a dose-dependent pattern (Figure 4). The highest concentration (125 \u00b5g.mL\u22121) reduced the interaction by 92.45 \u00b1 3.65%, which is similar to what was observed at 250 \u00b5g.mL\u22121 (Figure 1). Interestingly, the removal of phenolic compounds by lead acetate clean-up abolished the inhibition potential of #76 extract by 70% at the highest concentration (125 \u00b5g.mL\u22121), as shown in Figure 4, suggesting that phenolic compounds and not saponins are responsible for hampering RDB and ACE2 interaction.

UHPLC\u2013PDA\u2013MS/MS analysis of extract #76 revealed the presence of 3\u2032,5\u2032di-Cglucosyl phloretin (8) and quercetin 3-O-deoxyhexoside (9) by comparison of their APCIMS/MS spectrometric data (fragmentation patterns) and photodiode array PDA/UV/Vis with data from the literature (Table 2) [40,41]. Compound (7) remained unidentified, but it was possible to hypothesize its structure as a C-glycosyl flavonoid based on the similarity of its mass fragmentation pattern when compared with 3\u2032,5\u2032di-C-glucosyl phloretin, (8). The tandem mass spectrum produced by compounds 7 and 8, showed a pattern typical of a C-glycosyl derivative. The fragmentation profiles of these C-glycosylated flavonoids are characterized by the loss of water molecules followed by the fragmentation of the hexose units with fragment ions at m/z [M-H-90]\u2212 and m/z [M-H-120]\u2212 (Figure 6). Compound 7 at m/z 621 [M-H]\u2212 follows this pattern with fragment ions at m/z 531 [M-H-90]\u2212 and m/z 501 [M-H-120]\u2212 [14,42], in addition to the ion at m/z 603 corresponding to a water loss [M-H-H2O]\u2212 (Figure S8).

In addition, fragment ions characteristic of this aglycone were observed at m/z 271, 255, and 179 [41]. This is the first report on the phenolic composition of bark extracts of A. amazonicus, in which only saponins and triterpenes have been previously identified [31,34,35,37,38]. Despite saponins being the major compounds in the plant extracts, the phenolic compounds described in this study seem to be responsible for the inhibition of SP and ACE2 interaction. Polyphenolic compounds are among the most promising chemical class of SARS-CoV2 inhibitors [43]. A recent review compiled the structure\u2013activity relationships of plant phenolics with antiviral activities against human coronaviruses [44], showing that data on viral entry inhibitors are scarce. The flavonoid luteolin has been shown to inhibit the entry of HIV-luc/SARS pseudotyped virus and wild-typed SARS-CoV into Vero E6 cells without substantial cytotoxicity. Emodin, an anthraquinone, inhibited the interaction between SARS-CoV S protein and ACE2 receptor in a dose-dependent manner. However, most of the studies with SARS-CoV-2 SP and ACE2 interactions are in silico studies. Computational studies showed that catechin and curcumin bind the interface of the \u2018RBD:ACE2-complex\u2019, suggesting the efficacy of these two polyphenols in hindering the formation of SP and ACE2 complex [45]. Structure-based virtual screening of the Taiwan Database of Extracts and Compounds identified 39 natural products targeting the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein; among them, amentoflavone was selected as the best one [46]. Recently, surface plasmon resonance of candidate molecular binders has been performed to determine the binding affinities and kinetics for RBD of a group of five compounds previously selected by a virtual screening of a natural product database, one of which was 5,4\u2032-di-hydroxy-6,7-di-glucosyl-flavanone [47]. Concerning chalcones, a recent in silico study screened a library of natural and synthetic chalcones against homology-modeled S protein. Analysis of protein\u2013ligand docking revealed that phloretin can interact with the spike proteins\u2019 key RBD, pointing to this class of natural compounds as promising [48].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3159 10 of 19\nInterestingly, in another recent in silico study, phloretin showed a strong inhibitory effect on the crucial residues ASN417, SER496, TYR501, and HIS505 of the omicron receptorbinding domain (RBD), which are supported for the inviolable omicron and angiotensinconverting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor interaction [49]. Additionally, the authors state that phloretin is suggested as the antiviral drug against omicron B.1.1.529, which strongly supports our findings that 3\u2032,5\u2032di-C-glucosyl phloretin is in part responsible for blocking the SP and ACE2 interaction in extract #76. On the other side, flavones such as quercetin and their derivatives are currently considered promising compounds for COVID-19 treatment [50]. Quercetin possesses a 15-carbon skeleton with a chromone core comprising bicyclic 1,4-benzopyrone (A- and Crings) substituted on carbon 2 with a catechol moiety (B-ring), with hydroxyl groups at positions 3\u2032, and 4\u2032 with electron-donating activity [51]. The presence of hydroxyl groups in the B-ring reflects positively on its binding affinities to the viral target [52]. In silico and in vitro studies have been focused on quercetin, testing it experimentally against some targets such the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, with promising results showing its potential as an antiviral agent [53,54]. In an in silico study [55], the authors suggest that beyond the interaction with active sites of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, polyphenols from Geranii herba could interact in the cell surface receptor glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) to regulate the cell signaling to release ER stress and other processes. They could also interact either directly or indirectly with the Cys/His dyad of the main protease to inhibit viral replication. In this way, polyphenols could interfere with viral pathogenesis in various stages [56]. Moreover, flavonoids are known for their potential ability to regulate inflammatory mediators and inhibit endothelial activation, among other factors, which might be beneficial in regulating the cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and may positively influence inflammatory changes associated with COVID-19 [57]. Additionally, phenol-rich extracts from plants have also demonstrated antiinflamatory activity [58,59]. The results presented here show evidence that supports that compounds belonging to chalcones and flavones in the A. amazonicus extracts were able to inhibit the binding of the viral spike protein to its ACE2 receptor, which is one vital mechanism for the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2 viruses."

Extracts R2\nvaried from 0.85 to 0.97.\nAccording to the chromatographic profile shown in Figure 2, the samples seem to be very similar regarding the saponins profile, which may explain the fact that they are all active in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication. Although the results obtained previously demonstrate that A. amazonicus extracts can act on the ligand\u2013receptor interaction of a structural protein and that this action is linked to the phenolic compounds in the extract, antiviral activity is a complex process and can exhibit different possibilities of interference. In this section, the results shown reflect that A. amazonicus extracts (especially #75 and #156) also act on a distinct target, quite possibly non-structural proteins, since the model represents a scenario in which the infection is already established. RBD:ACE2 binding assays demonstrate that saponins are not important for the interaction\u2019s inhibition, unlike the polyphenols in the extract. However, it is known that saponins have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, properties already demonstrated for these same extracts and that are important in the clinical approach to COVID-19 treatment [30,31,63,64]. Additionally, this action would also support the traditional use of\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3159 12 of 19\nthis species by Amazonian communities [32]. Interestingly, there is one record for an antiSARS-CoV-2 compound in the Rhamnnaceae family: jubanine B, a cyclopeptide alkaloid from Ziziphus spina-christii (L) Desf. was demonstrated to be a promising ligand of 3CLpro protein, the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 virus [65]. A. amazonicus is an Amazonian adaptogen [29], and plants with this characteristic could consist of interesting models to be explored in drug discovery against SARS-CoV2. Several traditional Chinese medicine protocols have been evaluated since 2020 in the treatment of COVID-19, using in silico, in vivo, and in vitro approaches [66]. As the basis of these practices are contained in medicinal plants and natural products, the good results presented here show that alternatives from plant secondary metabolites are very promising. Panax ginseng Meyer, popularly known as Korean ginseng, is a plant with a high content of saponins structurally similar to the ones present in A. amazonicus, with dammarane triterpene structure [67]. It has been shown, in vivo that transgenic mice that were fed with ginseng extracts had much lower virus titers than the ones that were not. Additionally, interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) production was significantly higher in the lung tissue of the mice fed with ginseng extracts [68], demonstrating the potential of this species in SARS-CoV-2 infection, not only in virus replication but also in host response. Similarly to A. amazonicus, P. ginseng is also used in traditional medicine as an immune system fortifier, and has been pointed out as a potential treatment for COVID-19 [69]. Therefore, A. amazonicus is an interesting species to be considered in new drug discoveries to counter SARS-CoV-2, since it presents promising substances with proven action in its replication process."

Water (18.2 M\u2126\u00b7cm) was from a Millipore Direct-Q\u00ae purification system. Four different A. amazonicus bark extracts from our biobank library (registered at the Sistema Nacional de Gest\u00e3o do Patrim\u00f4nio Gen\u00e9tico e do Conhecimento Tradicional Associado, SISGEN, under the registration number CB8C853), coded with numbers #74, #75, #76 and #156, were used for in vitro assays. Ampelozizyphus amazonicus was collected in August 2008, in the Brazilian Amazon region of Oriximina (Para state). Bark was dried in a ventilated oven (Marconi, model MA037) and ground in a hammer mill (Marconi, model MA340, serial 9304176). The preparation of extracts #74, #76 and #156 is reported in the literature (#74) [30], (#156) [31] and (#76) [34]. In brief, extract #74 was prepared with 250 g of dried and ground bark submitted to extraction with boiling water (5% w/v) for 15 min and filtered. A second extraction was performed with boiling water (2.5%, w/v, 30 min). The extracts were mixed and infused into a spray-dryer nozzle unit of a Buchi \u00a8Mini Spray Dryer B-290 (Buchi LaboratoriusTechnik AG, Flawil 1, Switzerland) [30]. The extractive yield was 4.5%. Extract #75 was prepared with commercial ethanol (96%) from the cake resulting from the aqueous extraction that generated extract #74, until exhaustion of plant material. It was then filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator, at a temperature not exceeding 40 \u25e6C. The extractive yield was 7.3%. For extract #76, ground and dried bark (346.544 g) were extracted with commercial ethanol (96%) by percolation until exhaustion. The extract was filtered, and ethanol was removed by rotary evaporation at 40 \u25e6C under reduced pressure [34]. The extractive yield was 8.61%. Finally, to extract #156, dried and ground bark was used for the preparation of extract at the Centroflora Group facility, Botucatu, SP, Brazil. The bark (14.9 kg) was submitted to a two-step extraction process as follows: extraction with boiling water (5% w/v) for 15 min, followed by a second extraction with boiling water (2.5%, w/v) for 30 min. The extracts were mixed and filtered (using a rotary drum filter with a mesh of 30 \u00b5m) and then concentrated until the total solid level\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3159 13 of 19\nreached 24% (w/v) (Bernauer evaporator). Final drying was achieved by spray drying as reported in [31]. The extractive yield was 4.52%. A brief description of the methodologies is presented in Table 4. The work was authorized by Conselho de Gest\u00e3o do Patrim\u00f4nio Gen\u00e9tico (CGEN) to access the traditional knowledge with bioprospecting purposes, by the Resolution CGEN no. 213 (6 December 2007), renewed in the Resolution CGEN no. 87/2012, and by the authorizations AEAC3E9 in 2018, and A5A49CA in 2022."

            "text": "Until now, all studies regarding A. amazonicus have attributed the species\u2019 promising pharmacological potential to saponins, its class of major compounds. This work is the first to report the phenolic composition of A. amazonicus and to show the important role that these substances hold in inhibiting the binding between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2 receptor. However, when evaluating a different target, such as viral replication post-infection, saracura-mir\u00e1 extracts also present promising activity reducing viral titers, which means that saponins may also contribute to the antiviral potential of A. amazonicus. In addition, the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity of these extracts has already been proven and attributed to this class of compounds. These two features represent very important approaches to the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as they are able to control symptoms and prevent evolution into severe cases, as has been highlighted in the popular use of A. amazonicus. Therefore, it is believed that A. amazonicus can contribute to controlling the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 through several mechanisms, standing out as a multitarget agent. The data presented here, together with the literature and recent reports on the medicinal use of A. amazonicus, strongly suggest that this species could be a possible candidate and model for the development of new drugs to treat COVID-19.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28073159/s1, Figure S1: MS/MS spectra of compound 1 at m/z 959.4 [M-H]\u2212; Figure S2: MS/MS spectra of compound 2 at m/z 973.3 [M-H]\u2212; Figure S3: MS/MS spectra of compound 3 at m/z 943.4 [M-H]\u2212; Figure S4: MS/MS spectra of compound 4 at m/z 957.3 [M-H]\u2212; Figure S5: MS/MS spectra of compound 5 at m/z 1059.3 [M-H]\u2212; Figure S6: MS/MS spectra of compound 6 at m/z 897.5 [M-H]\u2212; Figure S7: MS profile of extracts in the region of UV absorption compounds (0\u20135 min); Figure S8: MS/MS spectra of compound 7 at m/z 621.4 [M-H]\u2212; Figure S9: MS/MS spectra of compound 8 at m/z 597.5 [M-H]\u2212; Figure S10: MS/MS spectra of compound 9 at m/z 465.7 [M-H+H2O]\u2212 (water adduct).\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, G.G.L., D.A. and S.G.L.; Data curation, M.F.C., S.C.M., B.A.C.d.O., A.S.R., A.R.T., V.N.S.F. and T.K.F.O.; Formal analysis, M.F.C., S.C.M., B.A.C.d.O., A.S.R., A.R.T., V.N.S.F. and T.K.F.O.; Funding acquisition, G.G.L., M.D.M., D.A. and S.G.L.; Investigation, M.F.C., S.C.M., E.M.C.P., B.A.C.d.O., A.S.R., A.R.T., V.N.S.F., T.K.F.O., M.D.M. and S.G.L.; Methodology, M.F.C., S.C.M., E.M.C.P., B.A.C.d.O., A.S.R., A.R.T., V.N.S.F., T.K.F.O., M.D.M., D.A. and S.G.L.; Project administration, G.G.L., D.A. and S.G.L.; Supervision, G.G.L. and S.G.L.; Writing\u2014original draft, M.F.C., S.C.M. and E.M.C.P.; Writing\u2014review and editing, M.F.C., S.C.M., E.M.C.P., G.G.L., M.D.M., D.A. and S.G.L.
