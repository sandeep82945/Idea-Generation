    "abstractText": "Sulfated metabolites have shown to have potential as long-term markers (LTMs) of anabolic\u2013androgenic steroid (AAS) abuse. The compatibility of gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) with trimethylsilyl(TMS)-derivatives of non-hydrolysed sulfated steroids has been demonstrated, where, after derivatisation, generally, two closely eluting isomers are formed that both have the same molecular ion [MH2SO4]. Sulfated reference standards are in limited commercial availability and therefore the current knowledge of the GC-MS behaviour of these compounds is mainly based on sulfating and analysing the available standard reference material. This procedure can unfortunately not cover all of the current known LTMs as these are often not available as pure substance. Therefore, in theory, some metabolites could be missed as they exhibit alternative behaviour. To investigate the matter, in-house sulfated reference materials that bear resemblance to known sulfated LTMs were analysed on GC-MS in their TMS-derivatised non-hydrolysed state. The (alternative) gas chromatographic and mass spectrometric behaviour was mapped, evaluated and linked to the corresponding steroid structures. Afterwards, using fraction collection, known sulfated LTMs were isolated from excretion urine to confirm the observed findings. The categories that were selected were mono-hydroxy-diones, 17-methyl-3,17-diols and 17keto-3,16-diols as these are commonly encountered AAS conformations. The ability to predict the GC-MS behaviour of non-hydrolysed sulfated AAS metabolites is the corner stone of finding new metabolites. This knowledge is also essential for e.g., understanding AAS detection analyses, for the mass spectrometric characterization of metabolites of new designer steroids or when one needs to characterize an unknown steroid structure. http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/dta Drug Testing and Analysis",

            "text": "The prevalence of anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) use among doping rule-breaking athletes in\nsport is highlighted by the fact that they have been continuously listed as the most detected substance for\ndoping violations (i.e., adverse analytical findings) over the past years1\u20135. Furthermore, the re-analysis\nprogram of the 2004, 2008 and 2012 summer Olympic Games revealed that of the 191 counts of detected\nprohibited substances in previously declared negative samples, the use of AAS accounted for 90%.6\nAlthough this is partly explained by improved instrumentation, it is also a consequence of the discovery of\nnew long-term metabolites (LTM). Due to recent research, non-hydrolysed sulfated metabolites have gained\nrenewed interest as evidence has emerged of prolonged detection times in comparison with the conventional\nmarkers for methandienone7, clostebol8, 17\u03b1-methyltestosterone9, metenolone10 and mesterolone.11\nInvestigations into their potential have been conducted using both liquid chromatography (LC) and gas\nchromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) but there are some fundamental differences between these\ntwo modes of detection.\nFirst, the benefits of using LC-MS include that no derivatisation is required before analysis, saving\ntime and cost in materials, and intact sulfated metabolites are detected. The disadvantage is that the detection\nis generally based on the sulfate group cleaving off from the steroid molecule (i.e., detection of the cleaved\nsulfate group m/z 97 ([HSO4]\u2212) and/or m/z 80 ([SO3]\u2212)) which does not reveal any compound-specific information.12\nSecond, a recent paper conducted on GC-MS has demonstrated that, contrary to the general\nconsensus13,14, non-hydrolysed sulfated steroids do not require hydrolysis before analysis.15 However,\ncontrary to LC-MS, derivatisation is required to take full use of the separation capabilities of the GC-MS.\nBy this direct injection of the trimethylsilyl (TMS)-derivatised non-hydrolysed sulfated steroid the sulfate is\ncleaved off in the inlet, generally forming 2 closely eluting isomers that both have the same molecular ion\n[M-H2SO4]\u2022+. As such, the core structure of the steroid molecule remains intact, facilitating detection, characterization and\nconfirmation of the steroid by for example further fragmentation to obtain more compound-specific ions.\nDue to the limited availability of commercially sulfated reference standards, the current knowledge\nregarding analysis of TMS-derivatised non-hydrolysed sulfated metabolites on GC-MS is mainly based on\nPage 4 of 46\nhttp://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/dta\nDrug Testing and Analysis\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\nFor Peer Review\nsulfating the available standard reference material of the free steroid, using the procedure published by\nWaller and McLeod16 and then analysing it. However, the available standard reference materials do not\ncover all the possible steroid structure configurations and, as such, not all LTM. So doping control\nlaboratories still rely on excretion samples to detect and confirm the presence of LTM. Similarly, as the\ncurrent knowledge on for example gas chromatographic and mass spectrometric behaviour of TMS-\nderivatised non-hydrolysed sulfated steroids on GC-MS is based on what standards are available, there is, in\ntheory, a possibility that the detection of some new (long term) metabolites could be missed as they have a\nnon-typical steroid structure (e.g., due to a non-typical metabolic pathway) and as such exhibit\nalternativenon-typical behaviour.\nTo investigate the matter, in-house sulfated reference materials that bear resemblance to three\ncategories of known sulfated LTMs were analysed on GC-electron ionisation (EI)- quadrupole time of flight\n(QTOF)-MS in their TMS-derivatised non-hydrolysed state. The (alternativeunconventional) gas\nchromatographic and mass spectrometric behaviour was mapped, evaluated and linked to the corresponding\nsteroid structures. Where available, excretion urine was used to confirm that the observed behaviour for the\nsulfated reference material could also be observed for structurally related metabolites isolated from\nexcretion urine.\nPage 5 of 46\nhttp://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/dta\nDrug Testing and Analysis\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\nFor Peer Review"

The synthesis procedure was verified by LC-ESI-QQQ-MS and\nthe data generated by GC-EI-QTOF-MS are presented in figure 1.\n[Figure_1_S-ADIONs.pdf]\nGenerallyConventionally, during injection of a TMS-derivatised non-hydrolysed sulfated steroid, the sulfate\nmoiety is cleaved off in the inlet and, depending on the compound structure, it forms one or two structural\nisomers, determined by the position of the double bond formed after cleavage, that exhibit the same\nmolecular ion [M-H2SO4]\u2022+.15 For mono-hydroxy-ADIONs, such expectedconventional molecular ion is m/z 428.2561 (C25H40O2Si2) and this is observed for 2\u03b1-sulfate-ADION. Here, cleavage of the 2\u03b1-sulfate group leads to only one isomer as there are no protons available on carbon 3 (figure 2). However, for the other\npositions, alternative unconventional behaviour and variations are observed for the main ion depending on\nthe sulfate position. The different behaviours are likely caused by a combination of the derivatisation\nmechanism of the molecule and the mechanism of sulfate moiety cleavage in the inlet. To aid the\nvisualisation of the process, potential pathways for the observed behaviors are listed in figure 2.\nPage 10 of 46\nhttp://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/dta\nDrug Testing and Analysis\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\nFor Peer Review\n[Figure_2_Pathway.pdf]\nIn case of 6\u03b1- and 6\u03b2-sulfate-ADION, the derivatisation of the 3-keto group on the A-ring will result\nin a double bond on either side of the keto group. Under normal circumstances, derivatisation of a 3-keto-4-\nene structure would lead to the 3,5-diene TMS derivative. However, due to sterical hinderance of the 6-\nsulfate group this is only partially true and also the 2,4-diene TMS derivative is formed.26 When the 3,5-\ndiene TMS derivative is formed this also leads to loss of the sulfate group during the derivatisation.\nDepending on the confoirmation of the sulfate group (i.e., 6\u03b1 or 6\u03b2), more or less sterical hinder occurs,\nleading to varying amounts of the 3,5-diene versus 2,4-diene TMS derivative. After injection, when\napplicable, cleavage of the sulfate group leads to a mixture of two compounds. One compound with the\nexpected main ion ([M-H2SO4]\u2022+, m/z 428) and one compound with an unusual main ion ([M-SO4]\u2022+, m/z 430).\nContrary to 2\u03b1-, 6\u03b1- and 6\u03b2-sulfate-ADION, 16\u03b1-sulfate-ADION does not exhibit [M-H2SO4]\u2022+, only\n[M-SO4]\u2022+ is observed. Formation of the 16-ene TMS derivative also leads to loss of the sulfate group during the derivatisation and the same unusual main ion ([M-SO4]\u2022+, m/z 430) is observed. Although this loss has not been previously observed, it has been described when sulfated steroids are analysed using fast atom\nbombardment (FAB)27,28 and its presence indicative of the sulfate position on the steroid molecule.28\nAs there is no sulfated reference material commercially available to investigate if similar behaviour\ncan be observed for other compounds with similar structure, a metabolite of metenolone was isolated from\nexcretion urine using fraction collection. This metabolite, 16\u03b2-sulfate-1-methyl-5\u03b1-androst-1-ene-3,17-\ndione, has previously been identified by Fragkaki et al.24 using LC-MS but has, up to now, never been\nanalysed on GC-MS in its TMS-derivatised non-hydrolysed state. The fraction containing the metabolite\nwas first analysed on LC-MS to confirm the identity of the compound and subsequently derivatised and\nanalysed on GC-EI-QTOF-MS. The A-ring is the same for this metabolite as it is for metenolone parent\ncompound which displays prominent ion fragments of m/z 179.0887, 195.1200 and 208.1278.10,29,30 By\nsearching for these three ions, one peak was observed and its spectra is presented in figure 3.\nPage 11 of 46\nhttp://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/dta\nDrug Testing and Analysis\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\nFor Peer Review\n[Figure_3_S-MetenMet.pdf]\nAccurate mass was obtained and demonstrates that the same behaviour is observed for this metenolone\nmetabolite as for 16\u03b1-sulfate-ADION. Due to this alternativeunconventional behaviour, this metabolite was\nnot detected in our previous investigation focussing on the discovery of new LTM in their TMS-derivatised\nnon-hydrolysed sulfated form using GC-MS.21 This illustrates the importance of mapping, evaluating and\nlinking alternativeunconventional behaviour to the corresponding steroid structures. It is of crucial\nimportance when e.g., searching for new long term metabolites or when one needs to characterize an\nunknown steroid structure.\nPage 12 of 46\nhttp://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/dta\nDrug Testing and Analysis\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\nFor Peer Review"

Scaling down the reaction was\nnot practically feasible and due to high costs and unreliable delivery times, the use of low amounts of\nreference material was preferred. Therefore, a slight modification (see section 2.2) was developed to favour\nthe formation of mono-sulfates. The modified procedure was applied to six compounds. Two metabolites of\n17\u03b1-methyltestosterone; 17\u03b1-methyl-5\u03b1-androstane-3\u03b1,17\u03b2-diol (5\u03b1-MT) and 17\u03b1-methyl-5\u03b2-androstane-\n3\u03b1,17\u03b2-diol (5\u03b2-MT), a metabolite of methasterone (2\u03b1,17\u03b1-dimethyl-5\u03b1-androstan-3\u03b1,17\u03b2-diol), a\nmetabolite of calusterone (7\u03b2,17\u03b1-dimethyl-5\u03b2-androstan-3\u03b1,17\u03b2-diol), a metabolite of mibolerone (7\u03b1,17\u03b1-\ndimethyl-5\u03b2-estrane-3\u03b1,17\u03b2-diol) and lastly, a metabolite of bolasterone (7\u03b1,17\u03b1-dimethyl-5\u03b2-androstan-\n3\u03b1,17\u03b2-diol). The synthesis procedure was verified by LC-ESI-QQQ-MS, and the GC-EI-QTOF-MS results\nare presented in figure 4.\n[Figure_4_MonoSulf_5a5b17OH17CH3.pdf]\nFor all compounds, a single peak was observed on LC-MS, suggesting that no mixtures were formed\nduring the synthesis. When analysed on GC-EI-QTOF-MS, m/z 143 and 130 are in high abundance for all\nsix compounds. These two ions are characteristic for trimethylsilylated 17-hydroxy, 17-methyl steroids31\u201333\nand thus the sulfate is on carbon 3 on the A-ring in all six cases.\nThe GC-MS behaviour of the sulfated 5\u03b1 and 5\u03b2 metabolites is peculiar in two instances. First, the\norder of elution is reversed compared to the non-conjugated forms, as the 5\u03b2-metabolites elude slightly\nahead of the 5\u03b1-metabolites, whereas they elute slightly behind in case of the non-conjugated forms. Second,\nis the total number of peaks formed when injected non-hydrolysed on GC-MS.\nPage 13 of 46\nhttp://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/dta\nDrug Testing and Analysis\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\nFor Peer Review\nWhen injected, 3\u03b1-sulfate-5\u03b1-MT forms the expectedconventional two isomers after cleavage of the\nsulfate group, while 3\u03b1-sulfate-methasterone metabolite forms only one of them. This is expected because\nthe formation of the second structural isomer is hindered by the methyl group on carbon 2. However, the\nmono-sulfated 5\u03b2 metabolites form three to five peaks and elute further apart compared to 3\u03b1-sulfate-5\u03b1-\nMT. Furthermore, the conformation of the methyl group on carbon 7 has an impact on the overall peak\npattern. When it is in a 7\u03b1 position, three peaks are formed but when in 7\u03b2 position, there are 4 peaks visible.\nThis is an indication that the B-ring plays a role in the formation of the overall peak pattern.\nSince there is no reference material commercially available to verify these observed GC-MS\nbehaviours, a pre- and post-administration sample of a 17\u03b1-methyltestosterone administration was subjected\nto fraction collection. An investigation conducted by Gomez et al.9 on LC-MS identified 5\u03b2-MT, 5\u03b1-17epi-\nMT and 5\u03b2-17epi-MT in the sulfate fraction and proposed 3\u03b1 as the sulfate position. The fraction collection\nsamples were first analysed on LC-MS to confirm the identity of the compounds and subsequentially\nanalysed on GC-EI-QTOF-MS. The results are displayed in figure 5.\n[Figure_5_S-MT-Met_new.pdf]\nComparing figure 4 and 5, the same GC-MS behaviour can be observed for the synthesised sulfated\nmetabolites as for the sulfated metabolites isolated from excretion urine. The high abundance of m/z 143 and\n130 for all three metabolites confirms carbon 3 as the sulfate position despite the observed endogenous\ninterference for m/z 130 at 4.9 min for 3\u03b1-sulfate-5\u03b2-17epi-MT. Furthermore, reversed elution order is also\nobserved for 3\u03b1-sulfate-5\u03b1- and 3\u03b1-sulfate-5\u03b2-17epi-MT. Additionally, both 5\u03b2-metabolites form more than\n2 peaks that elute further apart than is the case for 3\u03b1-sulfate-5\u03b1-17epi-MT. Due to the low concentration of\n3\u03b1-sulfate-5\u03b2-17epi-MT though, only three peaks are visible versus the five for 3\u03b1-sulfate-5\u03b2-MT.\nTo verify and confirm that these various GC-MS behaviours are due to the 5\u03b1- and 5\u03b2- configuration,\ncommercially available standard reference materials of 3\u03b1-sulfate-androsterone (5\u03b1) and 3\u03b1-sulfate-\netiocholanolone (5\u03b2), were analysed on GC-EI-QTOF-MS. The data are presented in figure 6.\n[Figure_6_AndroEtio.pdf]\nPage 14 of 46\nhttp://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/dta\nDrug Testing and Analysis\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\nFor Peer Review\nComparable GC-MS behaviour can be observed for 3\u03b1-sulfate-androsterone and 3\u03b1-sulfate-\netiocholanolone as in figures 4 and 5. Therefore, the difference in behaviour can be atributed to the\nconformation of the hydrogen on carbon 5.\nFirstly, the order of elution reversal is also observed compared to when injected non-conjugated,\nwhether partly (only the 3\u03b1-hydroxy group is derivatised) or fully derivatised. This is most likely due to how\nthe overall structural conformation is affected by the derivatisation.\nSecondly, again the difference in resolution between the peaks and peak pattern can be observed for\nthe two sulfated compounds. Also here, the 5\u03b1 (i.e., androsterone) forms the expectedconventional two\nisomers and 5\u03b2 (i.e., etiocholanolone) forms multible peaks, in this case five peaks. Most likely, this is\ncaused by the difference in their conformation where androsterone has trans junction between the A and B\nring, whereas etiocholanolone has cis junction between the two rings.34 Another related steroid,\ndehydroepiandrosterone (3\u03b2-hydroxy-androst-5-en-17-one, DHEA), has the B-ring in half chair\nconformation35 and when the commercially available reference material (in its sulfated form) is analysed\nwith the same method, it forms the two expectedconventional structural isomers but with a retention time\ndifference of 0.3 min instead of almost coeluting (data not shown). This verifies that the conformation has a\nsubstantial effect on the resolution between the two isomers.\nIn order to investigate how the different peak patterns are formed and to what extent the B-ring has a\nrole in it, as is suggested by the GC-MS behaviour of the three 7-methylated metabolites, the commercially\navailable standard reference materials of 3\u03b1-sulfate-d4-androsterone and 3\u03b1-sulfate-d5-etiocholanolone were\nanalysed using the aforementioned analytical technique. The data are presented in figure 7A.\n[Figure_&AB_Sd4A_Sd5E_Spectra.pdf]\nBased on the observed molecular ion of 3\u03b1-sulfate-d4-androsterone (i.e., [M-HDSO4]\u2022+) the double\nbonds are on either side of carbon 3. The five peak pattern observed for 3\u03b1-sulfate-etiocholanolone in figure\n6, is also present for 3\u03b1-sulfate-d5-etiocholanolone but two different molecular ions were observed, [M-\nHDSO4]\u2022+ and [M-H2SO4]\u2022+. Based on the observed molecular ions of peak 1 and 2, they most likely stem\nPage 15 of 46\nhttp://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/dta\nDrug Testing and Analysis\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\nFor Peer Review\nfrom expectedconventional sulfate cleaving as is observed for 3\u03b1-sulfate-d4-androsterone. The larger\nretention time gap between peak 1 and 2 is due to the conformation of the molecule as is the case for 3\u03b2-\nsulfate-DHEA. Peaks 3 to 5 are not formed by the expectedconventional cleaving of TMS-derivatised non-\nhydrolysed sulfated steroids. The molecular ion of peak 3, [M-H2SO4]\u2022+, shows only loss of hydrogens and despite using isothermal conditions, better separation could not be obtained. The mass spectra of peaks 4 and\n5 are displayed in figure 7B8. Peak 4 contains both molecular ions, [M-HDSO4]\u2022+ and [M-H2SO4]\u2022+, while peak 5 only has [M-H2SO4]\u2022+ where the sulfate cleaves off by leaving all the deuteriums behind. Unfortunately, the mass spectra of these peaks did not yield any further structural information. However, the\nobserved phenomena is likely the result of the sulfate interacting with hydrogens on the B-ring during the\ncleaving stage. Another indicator is that when looking at the peak pattern of mono-sulfated bolasterone and\nmibolerone metabolite in figure 4, peak 4 and 5 are not visible as both of these compounds have a 7\u03b1-methyl\ngroup causing stericalsteric hinderance. A possible explanation of the observed differences between the\nnumber of total structural isomers of the sulfated 5\u03b1 and 5\u03b2 metabolites could be their dissimilar availability\nof anti-coplanar hydrogen atoms leading to the formation of a cation as could be the case for 5\u03b2 metabolites.\nThe formation of the cation would lead to the elimination of hydrogens in various positions resulting in\nmore transpositions as has been described for other sulfated metabolites.36 Further investigation into this\nsubject would require the synthesis of several reference compounds and is beyond the scope of this paper.\n[FIGURE-8]\nPage 16 of 46\nhttp://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/dta\nDrug Testing and Analysis\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\nFor Peer Review"

The peak pattern observed on GC-MS for mono-sulfated 16\u03b1-hydroxy-etiocholanolone\nis the same as for sulfated etiocholanolone (figure 6). Therefore, the most probable position of the sulfate is\non carbon 3 in the A-ring in both cases. Additionally, better peak separation is observed here for peaks 2 to 5\nthan is observed for sulfated etiocholanolone. However, when bis-sulfated, the peak separation is negatively\naffected and a combination of expectedconventional and the alternative unconventional sulfate cleaving is\nobserved (i.e., [M-H2SO4-SO4]\u2022+).

Furthermore, excretion urine, where available, was used as substitute for sulfated reference material, as supply is limited, to confirm the observed behaviour of mono-sulfated diones and mono-sulfated saturated diols.\nThe cleaving of the sulfate group from the steroid molecule, and therefore the observed molecular\nion, is dependent on its position as was observed for mono-sulfated diones. The observed molecular ions ranged from purely expectedconventional ([M-H2SO4]\u2022+) to purely alternativeunconventional ([M-SO4]\u2022+) which 16\u03b1-sulfate-ADION exhibited. This was confirmed through analysis of the structurally similar monosulfated metabolite of metenolone that was overlooked in our previous investigation.\nA change in retention time and the total number of observed peaks was found to be due to the\nconformation of the mono-sulfated AAS metabolites where the 5\u03b1-metabolites generally showed the expectednormal two, close eluting peaks while three to five peaks could be observed for the 5\u03b2-metabolites. The analysis of 3\u03b1-sulfate-d5-etiocholanolone demonstrated that some of the minor peaks are due to interaction of the sulfate group with the B-ring during the sulfate cleaving off in the inlet.\nThe ability to accurately predict the GC-MS behaviour of TMS-derivatives of non-hydrolysed\nsulfated metabolites will greatly impact the success when searching for new metabolites as emphasised by the metenolone metabolite missed in our previous investigation. Furthermore, mapping, evaluating and linking (alternativeunconventional) gas chromatographic and mass spectrometric behaviour to the corresponding steroid structures provides important data that will be helpful in the elucidation of the structures of unknown steroids and in the search for new metabolites. It enables and facilitates detection, characterization and confirmation of AAS. The knowledge is e.g., essential for understanding AAS detection analyses, for the mass spectrometric characterization of metabolites of new designer steroids, for searching for new long term metabolites or when one needs to characterize an unknown steroid structure."
