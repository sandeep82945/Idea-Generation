However, lower resistance to experimental infection with 29 E. cuniculi was found in B-1 deficient mice (Xid), besides increased the number of CD8 30 T lymphocytes. Here, we evaluated the cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T lymphocytes from 31 Balb/c wild-type (WT) or Balb/c Xid mice (with B-1 cell deficiency) on the microbicidal 32 activity of macrophages challenged with E. cuniculi. CD8 T lymphocytes from WT or 33 Xid mice previously infected or not with E cuniculi were co-cultured with macrophages 34 challenged with E. cuniculi. We evaluated macrophages viability and microbicidal 35 activity, and proliferation, viability, and presence of activating molecules (CD62L, CD69, 36 and CD107a) in CD8 T lymphocytes. Macrophages co-cultured with CD8 T lymphocytes 37 from WT demonstrated high microbicidal activity. CD8 T lymphocytes obtained from 38 uninfected WT mice had a higher proliferative capacity and a higher expression of CD69 39 and LAMP-1-activating molecules compared to Xid CD8+ T lymphocytes. CD8 T 40 lymphocytes from infected Xid mice proliferated more than those from WT mice, 41 however, when the expression of the activating molecule CD69 associated with the 42 expression of CD62L was kept low. In conclusion, the absence of B-1 cells in Xid mice 43 might be associated with the lower expression of activating molecules in CD8+ T 44 lymphocytes and their cytotoxic activity. However, after a previous infection with E. 45 cuniculi, CD8 T lymphocytes were more effective in killing macrophages infected with 46 E. cuniculi.\nunder 17 USC 105 and is also made available for use under a CC0 license. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The phylum Microsporidia has at least 200 genera and more than 54 1,500 species, of which 17 species affect mammals, including domestic animals and 55 humans [2, 3] (Han et al., 2021; Mohamed et al., 2021). Microsporidian spores are 56 resistant and infective; they are usually ingested by susceptible hosts and infect host cells 57 by extruding their polar tubule, injecting the sporoplasm into the cytoplasm, which 58 initiates their development and proliferation [4, 5]. To survive, the pathogen fights against 59 the immune response using various adaptive evasion mechanisms. Encephalitozoon 60 cuniculi is used as a standard for studying the immune response in mice [6]. It infects 61 epithelial and endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages of various mammals, 62 including rabbits, rodents, carnivores, monkeys, several wild mammals, and humans [6]. 63 Several researchers have evaluated immunity against microsporidia, especially E. 64 cuniculi, in recent years, and highlighted the importance of adaptive immunity in 65 combating microsporidiosis [7, 8]. T cells protect against E. cuniculi infection [9, 10, 11]. 66 Some studies have shown that protective immunity against intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection 67 depends specifically on CD8 T cell immunity; TCD8\u2013/\u2013 mice died after inoculation of the 68 pathogen, which caused severe and disseminated disease [12, 13, 14, 15] . In contrast, E. 69 cuniculi infection of CD4\u2013/\u2013 mice did not result in any mortality [11]. Our group found 70 that several immunosuppressive doses of cyclophosphamide can increase the 71 susceptibility of mice to encephalitozoonosis by significantly reducing the population of 72 T lymphocytes [16]. 73 However, before acquired immunity is activated to control microsporidiosis, the innate 74 immune response must play its role in antigen preparation and presentation and milieu\nunder 17 USC 105 and is also made available for use under a CC0 license. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells (NKs), and 77 innate-like lymphocytes are essential for eliciting responses against microsporidian 78 infections [8]. Our group has investigated the effect of B-1 cells on encephalitozoonosis. 79 B-1 cells are a part of innate immunity and constitute a distinct population from B (B-2) 80 cells due to their anatomical location, phenotype, self-renewal capacity, and ability to 81 produce natural antibodies [17]. Generally, B-1 cells are found in the pleural and 82 peritoneal cavities and express high levels of IgM and low levels of IgD and CD11b on 83 their surface [18]. B-1 cells play a key role in acquired and innate immunity. To assess 84 their role, Balb/c Xid mice (Xid) are used because they are carriers of Bruton's tyrosine 85 kinase (Btk) deficiency, which leads to B cell deficiency [19, 20]. 86 In another study, our group showed that Xid mice were more susceptible to infection by 87 E. cuniculi than wild-type (WT) mice, via the oral and intraperitoneal route. This lower 88 resistance was associated with B-1 cell deficiency since the adoptive transfer of these 89 cells to Xid mice promoted the increase in immune cell populations and resulted in greater 90 resistance to infection [21, 22]. We also showed that Xid mice treated with Cy 91 immunosuppression developed severe and disseminated encephalitozoonosis, which was 92 similar to that reported in the models with T-cell deficiency. However, populations of 93 TCD8+ and TCD4+ lymphocytes in the peritoneum were higher than those in WT mice, 94 which had milder disease [23]. B-1 cells influenced the composition of pulmonary 95 granuloma induced by BCG in mice [24] and it was demonstrated that B-1 cells induced 96 a large infiltrate of CD8+ T lymphocytes in grafts [25]. Additionally, it has been 97 suggested that peritoneal B-1 cells may also influence the immune response by activating 98 T cells without necessarily migrating to the lymphoid organ responsible for eliciting a 99 response [26].\nunder 17 USC 105 and is also made available for use under a CC0 license. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Our aim was to 102 study the effects of CD8+ T lymphocytes obtained from WT mice (with B-1 cells) and 103 Xid mice (with B-1 cell deficiency) on the microbicidal activity of macrophages 104 challenged with E. cuniculi. 105 106 107 Methods 108 109 Ethics statement 110 All experiments involving animals were performed following the recommendations 111 outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Concea \u2013 Conselho 112 Nacional de Controlee m Experimenta\u00e7\u00e3o Animal).

WT or Xid mice 153 infected or not infected were administered ketamine (100 mg/mL), xylazine (20 mg/mL), 154 and fentanyl (0.05 mg/mL) intraperitoneally. After cardiorespiratory arrest, the animals 155 were washed with a chlorhexine solution and immersed in 70% alcohol. The spleens were 156 collected under sterile conditions and mechanically dissociated using a syringe plunger 157 and a 70 \u00b5m nylon mesh (cell strainer) in a PBS solution supplemented with 2% FBS 158 (PBS+FBS). After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and 1 mL of hemolytic 159 buffer was added. After 2 min, 10 mL of PBS+FBS was added, and the samples were 160 centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min. Next, the samples were incubated for 20 min with 161 anti-CD16/CD32 antibodies to block Fc receptors under refrigeration. The cells were 162 washed with PBS+FBS and incubated with the monoclonal antibody anti-mouse CD8 T 163 conjugated to Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC) (BD-Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), 164 which was suitable for determining the phenotype of CD8+ T cells. After the cells were 165 refrigerated for 20 min, they were washed and resuspended in 2 mL of PBS for cell sorting 166 using a flow cytometer (Supplementary figure). 167 168 Experimental Design 169 To understand the effects of B-1 cells on CD8 T lymphocytes, two experimental protocols 170 were used. Using the first protocol, na\u00efve CD8+ T lymphocytes were collected from the 171 spleen of uninfected WT and Xid mice and separated by cell sorting. Using the second 172 protocol, primed CD8+ T lymphocytes were collected by cell sorting from WT and Xid 173 mice after 14 days of infection with 1\u00d7107 spores of E. cuniculi, by i.p. route .

After washing with Mac\u2019s buffer (0.5% BSA and 0.075% EDTA), the 215 macrophages were labeled with mouse anti-F4/80 monoclonal antibody conjugated to 216 phycoerythrin (PE) and CD8 T cells with FITC-conjugated mouse anti-CD8 monoclonal 217 antibody for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. Once again, the washing with Mac\u2019s buffer was performed. 218 After that, the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in the Kit buffer, followed by the 219 addition of 1 \u00b5L of annexin and 1 \u00b5L of 7AAD. After 15 min of incubation at room 220 temperature in the dark, the kit buffer was again added, and apoptosis quantification was 221 performed on an AccuriTMC6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) 222 while collecting after 30 s from each of the tubes. 223\nunder 17 USC 105 and is also made available for use under a CC0 license. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Briefly, 227 1 \u00b5M CFSE was added to the lymphocytes and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min. Then, two 228 washes were performed with sterilized PBS. CFSE-CD8 T lymphocytes were co-cultured 229 with macrophages infected with E. cuniculi spores (described in Section 2.5) for 36 h at 230 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. After incubation, the supernatant containing the lymphocytes was 231 collected, centrifuged, and resuspended in 150 \u00b5L of PBS for analyzing the samples using 232 a flow cytometer (ACCURI C6 Sampler; BD Bioscience); the decrease in the CFSE 233 fluorescence intensity was used as a proliferation parameter. 234 235 Analysis of the cytotoxic activity 236 Macrophages infected with E. cuniculi (details in Section 2.5) were co-cultured with 237 CD8+ T lymphocytes from WT or Xid mice, previously separated by sorting, in a 5:1 ratio 238 (five lymphocytes to one macrophage). The cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. 239 After 31 h, 10 \u00b5L of mouse anti-CD107a (LAMP1) monoclonal antibodies conjugated to 240 Phycoerythrin (PE) were added per well. After 1 h, 0.5 \u00b5L of monensin and 0.5 \u00b5L of 241 brefeldin were added to the final solution (500 \u00b5L) to block protein transport across the 242 cell membrane. Upon completion of the experiment after 36 h, the supernatant was 243 collected, the adhered macrophages were released using a cell scraper, and they were 244 added to the lymphocytes in the supernatant. After centrifugation at 200g for 5 minutes, 245 the anti-Fc receptors were added to cells, with the subsequent separation of the sediment 246 into two aliquots.

The cells were incubated for 30 min under 250 refrigeration and away from light, washed and resuspended in 150 \u00b5L of PBS, and 251 analyzed using a flow cytometer. In panel 2, lymphocytes were labeled using interferon252 gamma (IFN-\u03b3). Briefly, the samples were permeabilized with a 253 Fixation/Permeabilization solution (BD Citofix/Citoperm - Fixation/Permeabilization 254 kit) for 20 min and then washed with Perm/Wash buffer. Next, the cells were incubated 255 for 30 min with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD8, PerCP-conjugated anti-F4/80, and 256 APC-conjugated anti-IFN-\u03b3 antibodies. Finally, the cells were washed with Perm/Wash 257 buffer, resuspended in 150 \u00b5L of PBS, and analyzed using an Accuri BD flow cytometer. 258 259 Microbicidal activity 260 Macrophages infected with E. cuniculi spores at a 2:1 ratio were co-cultured with CD8+ 261 T lymphocytes from WT or Xid mice, at a lymphocyte-to-macrophage ratio of 5:1 under 262 controlled conditions (37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2). After 36 h, both types of cells were harvested 263 and disrupted by alternately exposing them to cold (ice bath) and heat (70 \u00b0C) treatment 264 for 20 s in each condition. The process was repeated 20 times for the complete disruption 265 of cells and release of intracellular spores. The total number of spores collected was 266 denoted as T0. To determine that the spores were viable, they were inoculated into RK267 13 cells and cultured for seven days. Following this, the cells were harvested and 268 disrupted, and the number of spores present (T7) was counted. The T7/T0 ratio (Ratio = 269 final number of T7 spores/initial number of T0 spores) was evaluated and indicated the 270 proliferation of spores.

However, after 36 h of incubation, in co284 cultures with CD8 T lymphocytes from WT and Xid mice, few spores were detected with 285 their characteristics preserved (Fig. 2B and 2C). Also, fewer intact spores with 286 fluorescence green were detected inside the macrophages. However, the presence of 287 orange vacuoles indicated that phagolysosomes were frequent, suggesting spore 288 degradation (Fig. 2B and 2C). The contact between CD8 T lymphocytes and macrophages 289 was also visible, indicating intercellular communication occurred (Fig. 2C). 290 291 Figure 2.

CD8 T 305 lymphocytes can be seen adhering to macrophages (arrow). 306 307 Previous infection with E. cuniculi reduced the viability of macrophages 308 The viability of macrophages co-cultured with CD8 T lymphocytes obtained from 309 uninfected WT and Xid mice was similar; around 90\u201395% of the cells were viable (Fig. 310 3A, 3B). Death due to apoptosis was twice as high as that due to necrosis in the two 311 groups of cells. However, the viability of macrophages co-cultured with CD8 T 312 lymphocytes from E. cuniculi infected Xid mice previously was lower (60\u201370%) (Fig. 313 3E, 3F) and most cells died due to apoptosis (Fig. 3G, 3H). These results suggested that 314 lymphocytes from Xid mice infected with E. cuniculi induced an increase in the apoptosis 315 of macrophages. 316 317 Figure 3.

As E. cuniculi spores have a high affinity for RK cells, viable 335 spores could internalize the sporoplasm through the polar tubule and multiply inside these 336 cells. The results of the proliferation assay showed that the spores recovered from co337 cultures of macrophages with CD8 T lymphocytes from uninfected WT mice were not 338 viable (Fig. 4A), as the ratio between the spores inoculated in the RK cells to those 339 recovered was zero. This finding showed the high microbicidal capacity of the 340 macrophages in co-culture with CD8 T cells from WT uninfected mice. The proliferation 341 rate of spores recovered from co-cultures of macrophages with CD8 T lymphocytes from 342 uninfected Xid mice was high, i.e., the number of spores recovered from RK cell cultures 343 was 2\u201310 times greater than the number of spores initially inoculated, these results 344 confirmed the viability and subsequent multiplication of the spores in RK cells (Fig. 4A). 345 Our findings indicated a decrease in the microbicidal activity of macrophages that were 346 co-cultured with CD8 T lymphocytes from Xid mice. 347 The results of the proliferation assay performed for spores obtained from co-cultures with 348 lymphocytes from infected WT and Xid mice showed the opposite pattern.

These results suggested that B-1 cells, abundant in WT mice and deficient 416 in Xid mice, probably influenced the expression of co-stimulatory molecules, such as 417 CD69 in CD8 T lymphocytes. These findings explained the lower resistance of Xid mice 418 to encephalitozoonosis described by our group (Langanke et al., 2017). We found that the 419 expression of Lamp-1 increased in the lymphocytes of uninfected WT mice (Fig. 7A, 7B). 420 We examined the correlation between the co-stimulatory molecules CD62 x CD107 421 (Lamp-1) and CD62 x CD69 and found an inversely proportional relationship, i.e., the 422 expression of CD62L decreased as the expression of CD107 or CD69 increased on the\nunder 17 USC 105 and is also made available for use under a CC0 license. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Our group found 449 that intraperitoneal infection of Xid mice with E. cuniculi resulted in an increase in CD8+ 450 T lymphocytes in the spleen and peritoneum, although these mice showed a greater range 451 of clinical signs and fungal burden, which indicated lower resistance to infection [21, 23]. 452 In Xid mice infected orally with E. cuniculi, the decrease in the number of CD8+ T cells 453 in the spleen and peritoneum was associated with a decrease in the content of serum IFN454 \u03b3. These findings indicated that the resistance to infection was low [22]. 455 In this study, we found that CD8 T lymphocytes from WT (na\u00efve) mice showed high 456 proliferative capacity, a high percentage of CD69 activation molecules, a low mortality 457 rate, and high microbicidal activity when cultured with macrophages. These results 458 suggested that B-1 cells present in Balb mice potentiated the cytotoxic activity of 459 lymphocytes. However, CD8 T cells from Xid mice (deficient in B-1 cells) proliferated 460 less. They exhibited lower expression of activation molecules and lower microbicidal 461 activity of macrophages in co-cultures. Our findings suggested that the presence of B-1 462 cells (in Balb mice) or their deficiency (in Xid mice) altered the cytotoxic function of 463 CD8 T lymphocytes. These changes could explained why Xid mice showed low 464 resistance to E. cuniculi infection, although the population of CD8 T cells was quite large. 465 Our results were similar to those of studies in which B1-cells were found to potentiate the 466 activity of CD8 T lymphocytes [25, 26, 27, 28]. Thus, the relationship between 467 lymphocytes/B-1 cells/macrophages might be linked to functional factors involving 468 complex signaling pathways. 469 The expression of CD69 in infiltrating lymphocytes in inflamed tissues is a marker of 470 different signaling pathways, which can regulate tissue retention, metabolism, and their 471 activated phenotype [29].

Consistent with this 474 information, we found that CD8 T lymphocytes from WT mice showed higher expression 475 of CD69 and were associated with an increase in the microbicidal activity of macrophages 476 infected with E. cuniculi. The proliferation of CD8 T lymphocytes in this group of mice 477 was also higher, probably due a mitogenic stimulus. However, the reduction in the 478 microbicidal activity of macrophages co-cultured with CD8+CD69low T lymphocytes was 479 determined by the high proliferation of spores recovered from these assays. These 480 findings confirmed that a positive relationship occurred between CD69 expression in 481 CD8 T cells and macrophage stimulation, as recorded in tumor macrophages (TAM) [32].\n482 The CD8 T lymphocytes obtained from infected Xid mice (primed) with E. cuniculi 483 showed a higher mortality rate due to necrosis and less for apoptosis. A similar finding 484 was recorded for macrophages co-cultured with these lymphocytes. In another study, we 485 showed that macrophages infected with E. cuniculi have a higher rate of apoptosis, which 486 matched the findings described here [33]. The natural response of an infected cell is to 487 undergo apoptosis to prevent the pathogen from multiplying and spreading. However, 488 apoptosis can act as a mechanism to evade the immune response; for example, 489 Encephalitozoon can suppress apoptosis, as found in Vero cells, by inhibiting the 490 cleavage of caspase-3, phosphorylation, and translocation of p53 [34]. We also found that 491 E. cuniculi can exploit efferocytosis to enter the host cell, multiply, and spread, as well 492 as, modulate to a less inflamed environment. These changes act as a favorable mechanism 493 for evading immunity [33]. 494 We also found that lymphocytes from previously infected Xid mice showed higher 495 expression of CD107, demonstrating their ability to function against E. cuniculi.

The expression of CD107 is 502 associated with a decrease in the expression of CD62L. Also, the elimination of CD62L 503 and changes in the cytoskeleton are associated with an increase in the lytic activity of T 504 cells [38]. We hypothesized that higher expression of CD107 and proliferative activity 505 might explain the high microbicidal activity exerted by macrophages co-cultured with 506 Xid lymphocytes previously infected with E. cuniculi, considering that memory CD8 T 507 cells have greater potential for division, high chance of survival, and low effector activity. 508 In conclusion, our results suggest that the absence of B-1 cells in Xid mice might be 509 associated with the lower expression of activating molecules in CD8+ T lymphocytes and 510 their cytotoxic activity. However, after a previous infection with E. cuniculi, CD8 T 511 lymphocytes were more effective in killing macrophages infected with E. cuniculi. 512\n513\n514 Declaration of competing interest\n515 The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal 516 relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n517\n518 Funding 519 This work was supported by the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Ci\u00eancia do Estado de S\u00e3o 520 Paulo\u2013Fapesp (grant number: 2015/25948\u20132) and Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de 521 Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior-Capes.\nunder 17 USC 105 and is also made available for use under a CC0 license. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.
