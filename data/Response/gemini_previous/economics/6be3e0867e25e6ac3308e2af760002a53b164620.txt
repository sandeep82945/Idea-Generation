1. **Investigate the impact of time-varying parameters on the stability of the equilibrium points.** The paper assumes that the parameters of the model, such as the cross-holdings and the asset prices, are constant. However, in reality, these parameters are likely to change over time. It would be interesting to investigate how these changes affect the stability of the equilibrium points and the dynamics of the system.


2. **Develop a more detailed model of the financial system that includes additional factors, such as the role of central banks and the impact of government policies.** The paper presents a relatively simple model of the financial system that captures the main features of cascading failures. However, there are many other factors that could potentially affect the dynamics of the system. It would be valuable to develop a more detailed model that includes these additional factors in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the propagation of failures in financial systems.


3. **Analyze the impact of different network topologies on the dynamics of the system.** The paper assumes that the financial system is represented by a fully connected network. However, in reality, the financial system is more likely to be represented by a sparse network, where not all organizations are connected to each other. It would be interesting to investigate how the topology of the network affects the dynamics of the system and the propagation of failures.


4. **Develop a computational method for finding the equilibrium points of the system.** The paper presents a sign-space iteration method for finding the equilibrium points of the system. However, this method is not guaranteed to converge in all cases. It would be valuable to develop a more robust computational method for finding the equilibrium points of the system that can be used to analyze more complex models.


5. **Apply the model to real-world data to validate its predictions.** The paper presents a number of simulations to illustrate the behavior of the model. However, it would be valuable to apply the model to real-world data to validate its predictions. This could be done by using historical data on the equity values of organizations and the cross-holdings between organizations to estimate the parameters of the model and then simulating the model to see if it can reproduce the observed dynamics of the system.
