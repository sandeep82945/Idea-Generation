Comparative Analysis of Propolis from Different Geographical Locations: Building upon the detailed characterization of Gerês propolis, future research could expand to a comparative study of propolis collected from various geographical regions within Portugal and beyond. This would involve analyzing the chemical composition, bioactivities (antioxidant, antimicrobial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties), and quality parameters of propolis from different locales. Such studies could provide insights into the influence of environmental, climatic, and botanical diversity on propolis' bioactive profile, paving the way for the identification of region-specific propolis types with unique health benefits.

Longitudinal Studies on the Impact of Climate Change on Propolis Quality and Bioactivity: Given the observed consistency in the chemical and bioactive profiles of Gerês propolis over a four-year period, conducting longitudinal studies over a longer timeframe could assess the impact of climate change on propolis. This research could investigate how shifting climatic conditions, environmental stressors, and changes in bee foraging behavior affect the chemical composition, quality, and bioactivity of propolis. The findings could contribute to developing adaptive strategies for maintaining propolis quality amidst environmental changes.

Development of Standardized Propolis Extracts for Clinical Applications: The study highlighted the need for standardization in propolis research due to its complex and variable composition. Future work could focus on developing standardized propolis extracts with consistent chemical profiles and bioactivities. These standardized extracts could be tested in clinical trials to evaluate their efficacy in treating specific health conditions, such as wound healing, microbial infections, inflammation, and cancer. The goal would be to pave the way for the inclusion of propolis-based products in formal medical and therapeutic practices.

Exploration of Propolis' Synergistic Effects with Antibiotics and Other Natural Products: Considering the antimicrobial activity of Gerês propolis, future research could explore the synergistic effects of propolis when used in conjunction with antibiotics and other natural products. This could be particularly relevant in the context of antibiotic resistance, where propolis might enhance the efficacy of antibiotics or offer alternative antimicrobial strategies. Studies could investigate the mechanisms underlying these synergistic interactions and identify specific propolis compounds responsible for enhanced bioactivities.

In-Depth Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Propolis Bioactivities: While the paper documents the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of Gerês propolis, future research could delve deeper into the molecular mechanisms driving these bioactivities. This could involve using advanced analytical techniques, such as omics technologies, to identify the active compounds in propolis and their targets within cellular and molecular pathways. Understanding these mechanisms could contribute to the development of propolis-based pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals with targeted therapeutic actions.
