    "abstractText": "A compact quasi-Yagi antenna with a modified ground plane is designed for a through-wall radar (TWR) on-chip. A slot-based ground plane modification in the proposed antenna results in significant miniaturization with an increase in the impedance bandwidth by 44.62%. The antenna has a high directivity of 9.02 dBi and a front-to-back ratio of 25.76 dB at 2.4 GHz. Based on experiments in realworld deployment scenarios, the performance of the proposed quasi-Yagi antenna is found to be comparable to that of a Vivaldi antenna and a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) horn antenna. Spectrogram-based signatures of a moving person behind a wooden partition and a 40 cm thick masonry wall are successfully obtained using the designed antenna, demonstrating the suitability of the quasi-Yagi antenna for portable applications using a radar-on-chip.",

            "text": "A through-wall radar (TWR) based imaging system enables the determination of target locations behind walls and the remotemapping of the contents of a room. Such an imaging system is of special interest to the law enforcement, defence, and search and rescue departments in various countries1,2,3. Specific applications include concealed object detection at airports, thru-wall imaging for intelligence gathering at terrorist held buildings and the rescue of people buried under rubble in collapsed buildings4. The electromagnetic (EM) waves at the low microwave frequency range can penetrate common building materials, enabling the radar to image behind the wall. However, due to the complexity of the scattering scenario, the radar signal undergoes multipath propagation phenomena. These typically manifest themselves as environmental clutter, which may impair the detection and tracking of actual targets5,6,7. Ultrawideband (UWB) TWR technology has excellent potential due to the larger frequency range over which performance variation due to propagation characteristics of different building materials can be handled better8,9. An improved understanding of the TWR propagation mechanism and high-resolution, time-efficient imaging techniques, can enhance this technology2,10,11,12. It is recommended to use ultrawideband (UWB) modulation technology in order to deal with indoor propagation and to achieve improved range resolution for human localization13. In14, L-band frequencies are used to develop a real-aperture FMCW radar system for the detection of objects buried in heavily wet snow-pack. In15, a millimeter-wave frequency-modulated continuous wave radar is used for through-wall surveillance applications. However, the wall attenuation increases with the frequency of operation thereby decreasing the penetration capability8. The development of a robust TWR\n0Abbreviations: UWB, Ultra wide-band; FMCW, frequency modulated continuous wave; TWR, Through-wall radar\nar X\niv :2\n20 8.\n11 03\n4v 1\n[ ee\nss .S\nY ]\n2 3\nA ug\n2 02\n2\nsystem requires extensive theoretical and experimental studies involving the entire system, and its components such as the radar subsystem and the antenna. Through-wall radar systems provide significant challenges to antenna design due to varying levels of attenuation caused by different types of construction material such as concrete, brick and mortar, wood and glass. Hence a TWR antenna should have high directivity and gain. A compact ultrawideband antenna array for TWR applications is proposed in16 and a twoelement L-band quasi-Yagi antenna array in17, but the antenna has an omnidirectional radiation pattern. Portability often places a practical limit on antenna size for a given angular resolution. Therefore the antenna has to satisfy size and weight constraints. Ground-based radar systems, specifically TWR systems, operate in extremely complex propagation environments. It is therefore necessary to perform a comprehensive study of the radar system in different settings to develop a robust system18. A patch antenna is optimized for through-wall detection applications in19. However, the form factor of the antenna is larger than that of the compact quasi-Yagi design proposed in this work. The Vivaldi antenna has also been used in TWR systems2,20,19. However, a more compact antenna working in the desired band with satisfactory gain and radiation efficiency is required to optimize space in portable applications. This paper presents a compact planar quasi-Yagi antenna with a modified ground plane. A slot is introduced near the feed of the dipoles of the quasi-Yagi antenna in the ground plane which leads to increased effective electrical length, thereby causing miniaturization. Flaring is introduced in the arms of the dipoles to increase the impedance bandwidth (IBW), and directors are added to further improve the matching in the band. The proposed antenna offers a high gain of 7.8-9.8 dBi in the entire band of interest. Its size and performance are compared with planar quasi-Yagi antennas reported in recent literature. The rest of this paper is organised as follows. In section 2, the basic working principle of an FMCW radar is described with the specifications of a radar-on-chip used in this study. Section 3 discusses the antenna design for the radar. The design process and parameters of a Vivaldi antenna are discussed in section 3.1, while the development of the quasi-Yagi antenna and its miniaturisation is described in section 3.2. Section 4 presents experimental data obtained from radar system tests and its analysis in the context of specific deployment scenarios. Section 5 concludes the paper."

For an FMCW radar with start frequency fc , chirp bandwidth B and modulation time T with a target located at a distance d from the radar, the transmitted LFM chirp can be expressed as:\nSTx(t) = a0 cos [ 2 ( fct + st2\n2\n)\n+ 0\n]\n(1)\nwhere, s is slope of the chirp defined as, s= B T and 0 is the initial phase. After reflecting off a target situated at a distance d from the Radar, the received signal is a time delayed replica of the transmitted chirp, given by:\nSRx(t) = a1 cos [ 2 ( fc (t \u2212 ) + s (t \u2212 )2\n2\n)\n+ 0\n]\n(2)\nThe change in the amplitude incorporates the path loss and the radar cross section (RCS) of the target. The time delay ( ) is the time taken by the EM wave to travel the round-trip distance, 2d given as = 2d\nc .\nThe received signal is then mixed with an exact replica of the transmitted signal which is applied to the LO port of the mixer. The resulting waveform at the output port of the mixer is called the intermediate frequency (IF) signal expressed as\nSIF (t) = b cos [ 2 ( s t + fc \u2212 s 2\n2\n)]\n(3)\nThis process is termed de-chirping as illustrated in Fig. 2 (b). For a single stationary target, the IF signal is a single tone with its frequency linearly proportional to the delay of the echo, and thus related to the beat frequency fb as\nfb = s = 2sd c\n(4)\nThe target range can thus be determined from the beat frequency using (4). The maximum detected range depends on the transmit power and the sampling frequency of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), used to digitize the de-chirped signal. The range resolution of a radar is its ability to resolve two closely spaced objects. For two objects separated by a distance of \u0394d, the corresponding difference in their beat frequencies using (4) can be written as\n\u0394fb = 2s\u0394d c\n(5)\nAlso, an observation window of T can resolve two frequencies that are separated by more than more than 1\u2215T Hz, i.e., \u0394fb \u2265 1\u2215T . Using (5), we get\n\u0394d \u2265 c 2B\n(6)\nThus, the range resolution of the FMCW radar depends directly on the bandwidth of the radar."

The antenna is designed on an FR-4 substrate of thickness 1.6 mm with relative permittivity 4.3 and loss tangent 0.025. The inner edge and outer edge of both the arms of the antenna are exponential and each arm is metallized on either side of the substrate, flaring in the opposite direction to form a tapered slot. EM waves travel along the inner edges of the flared aperture and couple with each other to produce radiation. According to conventional theory24, the lower cutoff frequency of a Vivaldi antenna is determined by the width of antenna aperture, which can be expressed as cutoff = 2W . The exponential curve for the inner edge C1 is defined as;\nX(t) = fw \u2212 0.5fwe(a1(t\u22125) + W 1 2 , Y (t) = t (7)\nwhere t \u2208 [5, 148], fw is the width of feeding microstrip, and a1 = 0.027 is the rate of exponential curve for C1, and for the outer edge C2 is defined as;\nX(t) = \u22120.5fwea2(t\u22125) + W 1 2 , Y (t) = t (8)\nwhere t \u2208 [5, 29] and a2 = 0.16 is the rate of exponential curve for C2.\nThe antenna is designed to be fed through a 50 \u03a9 SMA connector followed by a gradual transition consisting of an exponentially contoured ground plane and a microstrip line, shown in Fig. 3 . Full 3D wave EM simulations for the design were performed on CST Microwave Studio Suite 202123. Fig. 4 (a) shows the S11 plots for the designed Vivaldi antenna. As shown in Fig. 4 (b), with 0 directors, the gain of the antenna varies from 6.8 to 8.8 dBi. To enhance the gain of the Vivaldi antenna, 2 directors are added between the inner edges. Consequently, the gain increases by 1 dB.\nThe radiation pattern plots for the E- and H-planes are shown in Fig. 5 . The antenna has a directivity of 10.44 dBi and frontto-back ratio of 14.44 dB at 2.4 GHz. The fabricated antenna and the measurement setup is shown in Fig. 6 . The measured result is obtained using a Keysight N5230A PNA series network analyzer, and the influence of the coaxial line is eliminated by calibration. It is observed that simulation results match the experimental results reasonably well."

            "text": "This section describes the design procedure for the proposed compact quasi-Yagi antenna for the TWR radar-on-chip (section 2.2). Fig. 7 illustrates the evolution of the designed antenna structure at various stages. A microstrip-fed printed directive dipole antenna operating at 2.34 GHz with an impedance bandwidth (IBW) of 13.24% (S11 < -10 dB) is chosen as the initial design (Fig. 7 (a)). The directive dipole consists of an x-directed printed dipole antenna with a partial ground plane. The printed dipole is excited by broadside-coupled co-planar strip-lines (BC-CPS). The partial ground plane acts as the reflector, which is essential for the directive operation of the antenna. The antenna is designed on a 1.6 mm thick FR-4 epoxy substrate with relative permittivity ( r) of 4.3 and loss tangent (tan ) of 0.025.\nFor a length of 1.25 (46 mm) the dipole radiates at 2.34 GHz. To reduce the size of the dipole a rectangular slot is introduced near the BC-CPS (Fig. 7 (b)). This modification of the ground plane shifts the centre frequency. The introduced slot has two parameters (glc and gwc) which can be tuned to obtain matching at the desired frequency. A parametric study to demonstrate the impact of glc and gwc variation, is shown in Fig. 8 . The dimensions of the slot were optimised (glc = gwc = 10 mm) to achieve a smaller dipole length (=0.97 ) for the same resonant frequency. The design was then used to obtain a 2-element array (Fig. 7 (c)) and to increase the bandwidth, the dipoles were flared at an angle of = 15\u25e6 (Fig. 7 (d)). Flaring in printed microstrip dipole antenna has been shown to improve the impedance bandwidth without adversely affecting the efficiency25. Upon flaring the dipoles, the IBW increased from 13.24% to 27.35%. Next, to improve the gain of the antenna, directors were added (Fig. 7 (d)). Starting with no directors, the number of directors was increased gradually. The gain of the antenna at 2.4 GHz for 0, 2, 6 and 12 directors was observed to be 3.09 dBi, 4.90 dBi, 6.80 dBi and 8.62 dBi, respectively. Due to the tradeoff between the gain and the size of the antenna, the number of directors was chosen to be 12. The final design offers a high IBW of 44.62%. The |S11| versus frequency plots for the antenna at each design stage are shown in Fig. 9 (a) and the gain plot for increasing number of directors is shown in Fig. 9 (b). The radiation patterns for the E-and H-planes at 2.4 GHz, are shown in Fig. 10 . The antenna has a measured gain of 8.7 dBi and front-to-back ratio of 25.76 dB at 2.4 GHz. A comparison between\nthe proposed and previously reported compact planar quasi-Yagi antennas is shown in Table 2 . The gain bandwidth product for the antennas is defined as the figure of merit. It can be seen in Table 2 that our final design in Fig. 7 (e) has the maximum gain bandwidth product. The proposed quasi-Yagi antenna has a modified ground structure for size reduction and offers a 22.4% reduction in dipole length and 36% reduction in the area of a single element antenna. Fig. 7 shows the structure of the antenna at different design stages. The fabricated antenna and measurement setup is shown in Fig. 11 . The measured results agree with the simulated results, and the fabrication tolerance can account for the slight discrepancies."

All the setups are real world scenarios where system level experiments were performed in the presence of clutter from static objects, multi-path propagation, etc. The obtained results are compared with that of a commercial off-theshelf (COTS) pyramidal horn antenna. The horn antenna has a high directivity of 15 dBi but its large and bulky form-factor makes it unsuitable for practical applications using the TWRoC. In all the conducted experiments, the TWRoC transmits an FMCW chirp between 2.052 and 2.6 GHz with a chirp rate of 11.2 MHz/ s at 0 dBm output power. The baseband signal from the radar output is fed to a Keysight 89601B vector signal analyzer (VSA), to obtain real time spectrograms. The VSA is set to acquire data with a frequency span of 1-20MHz and samples the incoming IF signal with a bandwidth of 24.32 MHz."

A volunteer walked back and forth in front of the antennas while the wooden door was kept closed. The experimental setup, using the closed door, is shown in Figs. 13 (a), (b) and (c).

We used a COTS power amplifier (MAAL-010200TR3000), which provides a power gain of 10-20 dB in the frequency band of 2-2.6 GHz. The thru-wall-radar setup is shown in Figs. 14 (a), (b) and (c).

Clearly, the signatures for the case of horn antenna are more prominent than that of the Vivaldi and quasi-Yagi antennas. However, the quasi-Yagi antenna is able to identify moving targets behind the wall to distances that are quite comparable with the horn. Using the above experiments, we have identified the range of the static objects (wall, wooden partition, metallic reflector, etc.) very close to the measured distance, as reported in Table 3 , 4 and 5 . Slight mismatches are due to the multiple reflections from a number of other static objects and the multi-path propagation of the waves since the experiments are conducted in a real world situation, instead of an ideal environment like an anechoic chamber. We have successfully observed the signatures of a walking human in two different environments and behind a brick wall using all the three antennas. Table 6 compares the physical dimension and weight of the three antennas used in this work. The signatures obtained from the planar antennas (Vivaldi and quasi-Yagi) may look faint when compared to the horn antenna on the same power scale but stronger signatures can be obtained by separately adjusting the mapping of the power levels for individual antennas to their respective color maps. Thus, the designed quasi-Yagi antenna can do the job as well as the horn antenna while significantly improving the portability and form factor of the complete radar system."
