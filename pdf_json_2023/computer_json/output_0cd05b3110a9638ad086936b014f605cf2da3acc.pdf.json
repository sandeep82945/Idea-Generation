    "abstractText": "1 Tuber size, shape, colorimetric characteristics, and defect susceptibility are all factors that 2 influence the acceptance of new potato cultivars. Despite the importance of these characteristics, 3 our understanding of their inheritance is substantially limited by our inability to precisely 4 measure these features quantitatively on the scale needed to evaluate breeding populations. To 5 alleviate this bottleneck, we developed a low-cost, semi-automated workflow to capture data and 6 measure each of these characteristics using machine vision. This workflow was applied to assess 7 the phenotypic variation present within 189 F1 progeny of the A08241 breeding population. Our 8 results provide an example of quantitative measurements acquired using machine vision methods 9 that are reliable, heritable, and can be used to understand and select upon multiple traits 10 simultaneously in structured potato breeding populations. 11 12",

            "text": "influence the acceptance of new potato cultivars. Despite the importance of these characteristics, 3 our understanding of their inheritance is substantially limited by our inability to precisely 4 measure these features quantitatively on the scale needed to evaluate breeding populations. To 5 alleviate this bottleneck, we developed a low-cost, semi-automated workflow to capture data and 6 measure each of these characteristics using machine vision. This workflow was applied to assess 7 the phenotypic variation present within 189 F1 progeny of the A08241 breeding population. Our 8 results provide an example of quantitative measurements acquired using machine vision methods 9 that are reliable, heritable, and can be used to understand and select upon multiple traits 10 simultaneously in structured potato breeding populations. 11 12 Keywords: Potato, Solanum tuberosum, phenotype, machine vision, heritability, machine 13 learning, hollow heart 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46\nIntroduction 47 The merits of the potato (Solanum tuberosum), particularly its yield potential and 48 nutritional benefits relative to other crops, have made it an essential global staple food along with 49 rice and wheat (Hirsch et al., 2013). The U.S. is a major producer of potatoes (~ 21 million 50 tonnes in 2019), a majority of which are used to manufacture processed foods (67%), particularly 51 French fries and potato chips (~78%) (USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2020). 52 Consumer preference for these processed food products have necessitated increased breeder 53 focus on tuber sugar and acrylamide levels, texture, specific gravity, and tuber shape to 54 consistently maintain the quality requirements of their finished products (Fajardo et al., 2013). 55 Tuber size and shape are especially important characteristics because they determine 56 compatibility for use in processing machines including peelers, cutters, and fryers, etc. as well as 57 the portion of a usable raw product after cutting and trimming (Bradeen & Kole, 2016; Pavek & 58 Knowles, 2015; Van Eck et al., 1994; Tao et al., 1995). Unlike grain crops, genetically identical 59 potato clones can exhibit substantial variation in tuber size and shape across field locations and 60 growth years, making it difficult to standardize the size and shape of any single potato clone 61 (Lindqvist-Kreuze et al., 2015; Van Eck et al., 1994). As such measurement of tuber size, shape, 62 and the variance of these characteristics is an essential component of both the breeding and clone 63 evaluation process. 64 Tuber size is traditionally quantified by gravimetric, mechanical, or optical sorting 65 methods and used to partition large tuber lots into categorical subsets of similar size. Tuber size 66 determination within large, bulk harvested tuber lots from late-stage trials (tens of clones, > 15 67 hill plot) frequently relies upon the acquisition and maintenance of dedicated sorting equipment. 68 Estimating tuber size in studies performed on early generation breeding material (hundreds of 69 clones, < 10 hill) is often performed manually using calipers (Lindqvist-Kreuze et al., 2015; 70 Prashar & Jones, 2014; Van Eck et al., 1994) or by separating individual tubers into categorical 71 descriptors by hand (Alsahlany et al., 2021; Bradshaw et al., 2008; Buhrig et al., 2015; 72 Doma\u0144ski, 2001; Hara-Skrzypiec et al., 2018; Li et al., 2005; Lindqvist-Kreuze et al., 2015; 73 \u015aliwka et al., 2008). 74 Description of tuber shape can be quantified either through ordinal numbering evaluation 75 (Alsahlany et al., 2021; Bradshaw et al., 2008; Doma\u0144ski, 2001; Hara-Skrzypiec et al., 2018;. Li 76 et al., 2005; Lindqvist-Kreuze et al., 2015; \u015aliwka et al., 2008; USDA Plant Variety Protection 77 Office, 2015) or as the relationship between individual measurements (Lindqvist-Kreuze et al., 78 2015; Prashar & Jones, 2014; Tabatabaeefar, 2002; Van Eck et al., 1994). Visual scoring of tuber 79 shape into ordinal categories is a rapid, quantitative way to assess shape. Categorical descriptors 80 of shape range in resolution from 2 shapes (round or long) all the way up to 6 shape categories 81 (long, long oval, oval, round-oval, round, compressed). These types of values are relatively easy 82 for humans to interpret but are limited in their descriptive capacity due to poor measurement 83 resolution (ordinal categories do not reflect the continuous variation in tuber shape), differences 84 in the magnitude of shape variance between tuber populations (all russet type tuber lot vs. 85 primitive introgression population), and variation introduced due to human bias (discordance 86 between human potato graders) (Poland & Nelson, 2011). 87 Length \u2013 width ratio (L/W ratio), also known as aspect ratio, is a commonly used, 88 quantitative tuber shape descriptor. Aspect ratio greater than 1.75 is an important tuber 89 characteristic that can determine the suitability of a clone or tuber lot for French fry production. 90 This descriptor readily discriminates between chipping and russet clones. These high-resolution 91 measurements can be acquired inexpensively using calipers or a ruler and be easily interpreted 92\nbetween experiments performed on different tuber population types. Tabulation of tuber length, 93 width, and their relationship provide greater depth and content than ordinal shape values. 94 Unfortunately they require greater effort to compile in terms of labor and recording on a per 95 tuber basis, limiting application within both basic research and mass production systems of the 96 food industry. Additional shape characteristics, such as tapered ends, or tuber bend is not 97 typically quantified in breeding populations. 98\nColorimetric characteristics of tuber skin and flesh are also key features that determine 99 the suitability of potato cultivars for different fresh market and processing market classes. These 100 features are important descriptors that may be used to predict pathogen infection or the presence 101 of tuber blemishes. Much of our knowledge pertaining to the genetic basis of potato skin and 102 flesh color has been ascertained from manual qualitative scoring of individual clones for their 103 color characteristics (Salaman, 1910; Zhang et al., 2009), whereas visual inspection of skin 104 quality and internal flesh color is an important component of tuber grading protocols. To date, 105 most research studies have relied upon categorical scoring of skin and flesh color performed by 106 human subjects (Buhrig et al., 2015; De Jong, 1987; Jung et al., 2009) or based upon 107 subsampling within a single tuber using a digital colorimeter (Buhrig et al., 2015; Qin et al., 108 2020; Roe et al., 2014; Thornton et al., 2013; Waterer, 2010). These types of measurement 109 strategies are subject to many of the challenges associated with manual measurements of tuber 110 shape; particularly the tradeoffs observed between accuracy, precision, resolution, and 111 throughput (Krupek et al., 2021; Miller et al., 2023; Roe et al., 2014). 112 The propensity of a clone to develop tuber defects is another important characteristic that 113 must be considered during the potato cultivar development process. Certain defects including 114 susceptibility to hollow heart, spraing, tuber greening, in-field sprouting, growth cracks and 115 knobby tuber outgrowth (secondary growth) are unacceptable and clones expressing these 116 defects must be identified and removed from breeding programs; whereas other defects including 117 tuber bruising, skinning, and scab or nematode susceptibility are important but can sometimes be 118 addressed through agronomic management strategies. The presence of hollow heart is somewhat 119 common and relatively easy to identify, making it an excellent test case to evaluate the feasibility 120 of machine learning based classification. This physiological, internal tuber defect that can occur 121 when growth in the perimedullary region of the tuber outpaces growth of the pith causing the 122 development of irregularly shaped cavities within the tuber pith tissue (Rex & Mazza, 1989). 123 Frequently, expression of this defect is a consequence of water or nutrient fluctuation during the 124 growth season. Genetics has been demonstrated to contribute to hollow heart susceptibility and 125 in some cases susceptibility is likely independent of final tuber size (Jansky & Thompson, 1990). 126 The invasive and low-throughput methods needed to evaluate internal defects prevent rigorous 127 evaluation during early generation selection process and limit our ability to understand the 128 genetic basis of these characteristics. Fortunately, work towards the detection and quantification 129 of tuber defects is becoming more prevalent in the literature (Marino et al., 2019; Miller et al., 130 2023; Moallem et al., 2013; Wang & Xiao, 2021). 131 Application of machine vision to quantify tuber size, shape, and color has been under 132 development by numerous groups since the late 1980s (J. Marchant et al., 1988; J. A. Marchant 133 et al., 1990; McClure & Morrow, 1987; Miller et al., 2023; Neilson et al., 2021). Data acquisition 134 using digital imaging and machine vision is an inexpensive, high-throughput technique that can 135 capture accurate measurements of multiple continuous traits simultaneously (Li et al., 2014). 136 Additionally, image data is long lived and can be revisited later for further analysis. Multiple 137 research groups report high correlation between manual and machine vision-based measurement 138\nof tuber size (Hasankhani & Navid, 2012; Neilson et al., 2021; Noordam et al., 2000; Si et al., 139 2017; Zhou et al., 1998), tuber shape (Hasankhani & Navid, 2012; Liu et al., 2021; Miller et al., 140 2023; Neilson et al., 2021; Noordam et al., 2000; Si et al., 2017; Su et al., 2017; Tao et al., 1995; 141 Zhou et al., 1998), or categorical descriptors of tuber color (Barnes et al., 2009; Caraza\u2010Harter & 142 Endelman, 2020; Miller et al., 2023). Generally, this process involves assigning pixels within a 143 digital image that encompass the potatoes using either manual thresholding (Miller et al., 2023; 144 Neilson et al., 2021; Si et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 1998) or machine learning techniques (Noordam 145 et al., 2000; Si et al., 2017; Tao et al., 1995) and calculating measurements from of the shape 146 contour of each tuber (Miller et al., 2023; Neilson et al., 2021; Noordam et al., 2000; Si et al., 147 2017; Tao et al., 1995; Zhou et al., 1998). In some cases, these measurement strategies have been 148 applied to collect and analyze data at the throughput needed in mechanical tuber grading 149 platforms (Hasankhani & Navid, 2012; Noordam et al., 2000; Rady & Guyer, 2015; Si et al., 150 2017; Zhou et al., 1998). 151 Surprisingly, outside of breeding value estimation for parental clones (Neilson et al., 152 2021), this technology has not been widely applied in the field of quantitative genetics in potato. 153 The routine linkage and association mapping techniques have been deployed in many other 154 cropping systems require quantitative measurement of plant phenotypes for each clone within 155 breeding populations that consist of hundreds-to-thousands of individual clones (Bernardo, 156 2019). We speculate this is largely because without mechanization, data collection is laborious 157 and the mechanical data collection platforms deployed require expensive, dedicated use 158 equipment that is not well suited for the evaluation of early generation breeding trials (hundreds 159 of clones, < 10 hills/plot) at small-to-medium size research stations. Knowledge derived from 160 such studies can be applied to better understand the underlying genetic architecture of these 161 important traits and be applied in marker assisted/genomic selection breeding schema. 162 In this study we utilize an image-based potato tuber measurement system, based on 163 consumer grade sensors and open-source data analysis workflows constructed with beginner 164 friendly, high-level programming languages (Python, R). Using student labor, we applied this 165 workflow to measure tuber size, tuber shape, colorimetric characteristics of tuber skin and flesh, 166 and hollow heart susceptibility on 189 F1 progeny within the A08241 breeding population, 167 replicated twice, using several different techniques. Our results indicate that quantitative 168 measurements acquired using this scalable methodology are reliable and can be used to measure, 169 understand, and select upon multiple traits simultaneously in potato breeding populations. 170 171 Materials and Methods 172 173 Plant material 174 The autotetraploid mapping population (A08241), comprised of 189 F1 progeny, was obtained 175 from a cross between a cultivar \u2018Palisade Russet\u2019 (female parent) and a breeding clone 176 \u2018ND028673B-2Russ\u2019 (male parent). This mapping population was initially created for late blight 177 resistance study and has been grown and maintained at USDA-ARS Small Grains and Potato 178 Germplasm Research Unit in Aberdeen, ID. For this study, the two parents and their progeny 179 were planted in a randomized complete block design with two replications of eight-hill plots in 180 2019. Both Palisade Russet (Novy et al., 2012) and ND028673_2Russ (Dr. Susie Thompson, 181 North Dakota State University, personal communication) show oblong or long tuber shape. For 182 all the experiments in this study we measured ten tubers from each clone (five tubers from 183 replication 1 and another five tubers from replication 2). 184\n185 Digital caliper measurement 186 After harvesting, five tubers per clone replicate (ten total tubers per clone) were randomly 187 selected and then their length and width were measured by a digital caliper. The length was 188 defined as the distance between stem-end and bud-end of the tuber. The definition of width was 189 the longest distance perpendicular to the length. The ratio of tuber length divided by tuber width 190 is reported as aspect ratio [aka length / width ratio (L/W ratio)]. The units for both distance 191 measurements are expressed in centimeters. 192 193 SolCAP visual assessment for tuber shape and weight measurement 194 Tuber shape of the whole population was visually scored from \u201c1\u201d (Compressed) to \u201c5\u201d (Long) 195 (Park et al., 2021). This measurement is called \u201cSolCAP Visual Assessment (SVA)\u201d in this 196 research project. For SVA, five tubers from each replication of each clone were horizontally 197 aligned on a plate first. After observing the five tubers, a researcher assigned a single score 198 representative of the entire sample, which reflects the average tuber shape of the five tubers. The 199 weight [unit: ounces (oz)] of each individual was also measured together. After completing data 200 collection, the SVA and weight data were compared with the digital caliper measurement. A 201 comparison between replication 1 and 2 data was also conducted. 202 203 Image acquisition 204 Digital images of up to 5 whole tubers per replicate were acquired of the same five 205 tubers/replicate that were measured previously with the digital caliper. A Nikon D7100 DSLR 206 camera with a Nikon AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-140mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR Lens (focal length 18 207 mm) was suspended 32\u201d above the floor of the imaging cabinet using a K&F Concept TM2534T 208 DSLR Camera Tripod (66\u201d) and counterbalanced with a 1-gallon water container was used for 209 digital imaging. Tubers were labeled with a permanent marker and arrayed in numerical order 210 under full power LED illumination (color temperature 5500K) within a HAVOX HPB-80D 211 photo studio on both a non-reflective black background and a Laboratory Supplies CO., Inc. Cat. 212 G129 Model A Illuminator equipped with two Philips 30-Watt Linear T12 Fluorescent Tube 213 Light Bulbs (color temperature 6500K). Two faces of each tuber were imaged on both the black 214 background and the illuminator light box by acquiring an image of each tuber side (take image, 215 then rotate tuber and take another image) on the black background (with the illuminator turned 216 off) and repeating this procedure again on top of the illuminator with the bulbs powered on. The 217 image acquisition process and camera settings were configured using a custom Python script run 218 on a Raspberry Pi 3 computer that minimized the potential for labeling mix ups and standardized 219 the camera settings across all images. Optimal camera settings were determined by autofocus 220 detection algorithms on the camera, recorded, and applied automatically to each image capture 221 using the Python gphoto2 library. When imaging on the black background images were captured 222 with white balance set to 5560K, ISO equal to 100, a F-Stop value of 7.1, and a shutter speed of 223 1/200 seconds. On the illuminator box, white balance and ISO were kept at 5560K and 100 224 respectively, whereas F-Stop was increased to 8 and shutter speed was reduced to 1/250 seconds. 225 The resulting JPEG images were written to the Raspberry Pi 3 computer and also saved on the 226 camera\u2019s SD card. 227 Digital scans of tuber flesh were acquired using a Hewlett Packard HP ColorJet 6200C 228 flatbed digital scanner controlled by the sane library in a custom Python program run on a 229 Raspberry Pi 3 computer. Before scanning each tuber was cut in half lengthwise and an image of 230\nthe labeled side of each tuber was captured by arraying the tubers in numerical order on the 231 scanning surface and covering the scanner with an opaque Rubbermaid storage bin to exclude 232 ambient light. 233 Both size and radiometric calibration standards were included in each image. A blue 234 plastic poker chip (37 mm diameter) was used as a size standard in all images and scans. An X-235 Rite ColorChecker Classic was used as a radiometric standard for the top-down imaging on the 236 black background whereas a X-Rite ColorChecker Mini was used as color standards for the top-237 down imaging on the illuminator and the scanner. Python scripts used to control the imaging 238 hardware can be found at: https://github.com/maxjfeldman/Feldman_hardware_control 239 240 Image processing 241 Input files were JPEG images (4000 \u00d7 6000 pixels from the top-down camera, and 2550 \u00d7 3507 242 pixels from the flatbed scanner) of the potato tubers that had been arrayed in numerical order and 243 arranged so that no two tubers were touching. Processing was achieved using custom Python 244 scripts that rely heavily on the functionality provided by the OpenCV library. In some cases 245 functions from the PlantCV library were also used (Fahlgren et al., 2015; Gehan et al., 2017). 246 Briefly, images were cropped to remove unwanted background features and gaussian blur was 247 used to obscure salt-and-pepper noise within the image. Potato tubers were isolated from 248 background by applying threshold selection on the saturation channel within the HSV color 249 space and b* channel in the CIE LAB color space. The binary image result after applying a 250 logical AND set operation on both thresholded binary images provided repeatable isolation of 251 the tuber from the image background. Contours of each individual tuber and size marker were 252 then used to extract shape and colorimetric measurements that were subsequently written to a 253 .csv file. 254 Measurement of potato tuber eccentricity was performed using the contourMoments 255 function in the OpenCV library on the derived tuber contour. Eccentricity is a measurement of 256 the of the shortest length of paths from a given vertex to reach any other vertex of the connected 257 graph. It can be considered an measure of roundness, where 0 is a perfect circle and an ellipse 258 exhibits a value greater than zero but less than one. 259 Tuber biomass profiles were calculated as reported by (Turner et al., 2018). Biomass 260 profiles are an example of latent traits that capture structural information about an object that 261 require biological interpretation through dimensional reduction usually using Principal 262 component analysis (PCA), autoencoders, persistent homology barcodes, or elliptical Fourier 263 descriptors. Each tuber contour was rotated to align the longest axis of a bounding ellipse to the 264 vertical axis of the image, then the image was cropped to its minimal bounding rectangle and 265 converted to a binary image. This rectangular image was then padded along the x-axis with zeros 266 to maintain axis ratio after resizing, and the resulting square binary image was resized to a 100 x 267 100 pixel image. For each of the 100 rows the number of tuber pixels across the sweep was 268 calculated and written to a .csv file. PCA was used to perform dimensional reduction before trait 269 evaluation. 270 Color correction of each image was performed in MATLAB using the colorChecker 271 function to identify the X-Rite ColorChecker Classic and the measureColor function was used to 272 derive and apply the color correction matrix. Colorimetric features were calculated as the mean 273 reflectance value (between 0 \u2013 255) within each tuber contour, across each of the R, G, and B 274 channels of the digital image. Dimensional reduction using principal component analysis was 275\napplied to these three mean color channel values (R, G, and B) using the prcomp function in R 276 and the resulting data analyzed. 277 Python and R computer scripts used to perform this analysis can be found at: 278 https://github.com/maxjfeldman/Park_Feldman_Tuber_Imaging_2023 279 280 281 282 Heritability calculation 283 Broad-sense heritability was calculated by fitting a linear model with genotype as the only 284 explanatory variable using the lmer function in the R package lme4. In cases where both sides of 285 each tuber were imaged, only the data from side one (as annotated in data file) was used to fit the 286 model. The model was fit using the following formula: 287 288 H2 = s2genotype / s2total variance 289 290 Measurement of repeatability between tuber sides/faces 291 To assess measurement repeatability, values of each trait collected through machine 292 vision techniques from top-down images of intact tubers were compared between tuber 293 sides/faces using Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient. Calculations were made using the cor 294 function in base R. Because only a single face of each halved tuber was collected using the 295 flatbed scanner it was not possible to assess repeatability of tuber flesh color. 296 297 Sample size variance calculations 298 To evaluate the ideal number of tuber samples needed per clone, we calculated the mean 299 standard error of each trait using 3 to 10 tuber samples. Smaller samples were simulated from 300 complete trait data of the 10 tubers by selecting smaller tuber samples at random. For each trait, 301 and each clone, the standard error of each sample size was calculated using the std_error 302 function from the plotrix package in R and then averaged across all clones. These average values 303 of standard error were plotted to evaluate gain of precision from each additional tuber measured. 304 305 Capture and augmentation of hollow heart dataset 306 Halved, individual tubers were labeled by their position in the scanner image and manually 307 scored for the presence or absence of internal defects according to the USDA grading standards 308 visual aid chart. This study utilized a dataset of 1500 RGB images of sliced potatoes with 309 dimensions of 1900x1900 pixels. Out of these, only 49 images depicted potatoes with the hollow-310 heart defect, representing less than 4% of the total dataset (Fig. S1). The dataset is imbalanced, 311 with a higher number of normal potato images compared to hollow-heart defect images. 312 Imbalanced data can negatively impact the performance of a classification model, potentially 313 leading to biased results and low accuracy. To address this, we utilized random augmentation, as 314 described below, on the hollow-heart defect images to artificially increase the size of the dataset 315 (Johnson & Khoshgoftaar, 2019). 316 Image augmentation is a technique that creates new training examples from existing ones 317 by applying random transformations to the images. These modifications, which may include 318 cropping, adjusting brightness and contrast, rotating, warping, and flipping, are intended to 319 increase the size and diversity of the training dataset. Image augmentation can help to improve 320 the performance and generalizability of machine learning models, particularly when the original 321\ndataset is small or lacks variety. In this study, a python library Albumentations (Buslaev et al., 322 2020) was used to perform random image augmentation on the hollow-heart potato images. The 323 Albumentations library offers a range of transformation options, including flipping, adjusting 324 brightness and contrast, distorting the image using a grid, rotating, scaling, and applying affine 325 transforms. These transformations were randomly applied to each hollow-heart potato image 326 (Fig. S2). The dataset now includes a total of 2431 images, with the number of hollow-heart 327 defect images having been increased from 49 to 980 using augmentation. 328 Before image augmentation, we used a random split method to assign 80% of the images 329 to the training set and 20% to the test set. This ensures that the model is trained on a 330 representative sample of the data and evaluated on unseen data. 331 After image augmentation, the original dataset was reshaped into 3 different resolutions 332 (256x256, 512x512, and 1024x1024) using bilinear interpolation. Deep learning models were 333 then trained and evaluated on these reshaped datasets to determine the minimum resolution 334 necessary for accurately classifying potatoes with hollow-heart defects from normal potatoes. 335 336 Deep learning network architecture and network training 337 A convolutional neural network (CNN) was implemented for the classification of 338 potatoes with or without the hollow-heart defect. The network (Fig. S3) contained an input layer 339 and five blocks (B0\u2013B5), each consisting of a 2D convolution, batch normalization, and 2D 340 Max-pooling layer. The convolution layer utilized a 3x3 filter, zero padding to maintain the same 341 input tensor size, and a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. The Max-pooling layer 342 employed a 2x2 pool size and a stride of 2. The output of block B5 was flattened and passed 343 through fully connected layers FC1, FC2, FC3, then the output layer (outputs 2 classes). The 344 fully connected layers output 1024, 128, 16, and 2 values, respectively, and utilized the ReLU 345 activation function. The CNN model was implemented using the TensorFlow deep learning 346 framework (Abadi et al., 2016) in Python. 347 To train the classification CNN, the dataset that was randomly split into three parts: a 348 training set, a validation set, and a test set. The ratio used was 6:3:1. The training set was used to 349 optimize the model's parameters, while the validation set was used to evaluate the model's 350 performance and tune its hyperparameters. The test set was used to evaluate the trained model's 351 performance on unseen data. To reduce the variance of the model's weights and improve its 352 generalization, the training data was shuffled and divided into small batches of 16 images before 353 each epoch. 354 The classification CNN was trained on a randomly split dataset consisting of two parts: a 355 training set, and a test set. The training dataset was split into a training and a validation using a 356 ratio of 7:3. The training set was utilized to optimize the model\u2019s parameters, while the validation 357 set was used to evaluate the model\u2019s performance and fine-tune its hyperparameters. The test 358 dataset was used to assess the trained model's performance on new, unseen data. To improve the 359 model's generalization and decrease the variance of its weights, the training data was shuffled and 360 split into small batches of 16 images before each epoch. This process was iterated 20 times to 361 ascertain the ideal model and performance tolerances. This comprehensive approach to training 362 and testing the CNN allowed for accurate evaluation of its performance on both seen and unseen 363 data, ensuring the model's optimized and reliable results. The Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 364 2014), a stochastic gradient descent method based on adaptive estimation of first and second order 365 moments, was utilized to adjust the model's parameters in order to minimize the loss function. The 366 categorical cross entropy loss function was chosen for this study because it is often used for 367\nclassification tasks involving the prediction of discrete class labels. It measures the difference 368 between the predicted probability distribution over the classes and the true distribution and is 369 minimized when the predicted probability for the true class is maximized. The initial learning rate 370 for training was set to 0.001. If the validation loss did not change for 10 epochs, the learning rate 371 was reduced by a factor of 0.05. The models were trained for a total of 400 epochs. 372 373 374 Model evaluation 375 Model evaluation is the process of assessing model performance on unseen data, also 376 known as the test set. In this study, the classification model's performance was evaluated using 377 two evaluation metrics: accuracy and loss. Accuracy is defined as the proportion of correct 378 predictions made by the model, while loss is a measure of the error between the predicted output 379 and the true output. Loss is often used as a training loss to guide the optimization process, and the 380 goal during training is to minimize loss in order to improve the model's prediction accuracy. The 381 networks were trained and inferred using a notebook that had an Intel Core i9-12900H processor, 382 64GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics card with 16GB of VRAM. 383 Additionally, the code for the workflow is available for public usage on GitHub at: 384 https://github.com/collinswakholi/Potato-defect-detection 385 This allows for the reproduction of the results obtained in this study and enables other 386 researchers to build upon this work.. 387 388 Results 389 Top-down imaging of whole tubers and flatbed scans of halved tubers was used to collect 390 measurements of tuber size, shape, skin color and flesh color for each clone. Top-down imaging 391 was performed using both a dark non-reflective background and a lightbox background. 392 393 Measurement of tuber size 394 Systematic differences in the relative size of an object standard were observed across all 395 imaging configurations. Variation in area measurements calculated from a size standard was 396 minimized on the black background: standard deviation for object of same size: 3.97 mm2 on the 397 black background, 4.54 mm2 on the scanner, and 12.81 mm2 on the lightbox background (Fig. 398 S4). Variation in size measurements was generally less than 5% of the total for an object the size 399 of a poker chip (area: 1075 mm2, diameter: 37 mm) and linear measurements exhibit a standard 400 error of < 2 mm (Fig. S4). The size standard exhibited significantly less variation on the black 401 background relative to the lightbox in the top-down imaging configuration. Regardless of 402 conformation used, variation in measurement was small relative to the size of the object 403 standard. 404 Tuber size in terms of length and width as measured by caliper or gravimetric 405 measurement of tuber weight exhibited high correlation with relative pixel area (Fig. 1). Tuber 406 length as measured by caliper and relative pixel area exhibited the highest correlation (r2 > 0.98) 407 whereas width measurements (r2 > 0.96) and comparison of tuber weight and relative tuber area 408 (r2 > 0.93) all exhibited correlation greater than 0.9; indicating that machine vision 409 measurements provide adequate predictive ability to estimate tuber size within this population. 410 Measurements of these size characteristics from different faces/sides of each tuber were 411 practically identical (r2 > 0.98; for all characteristics), suggesting that it is not necessary to image 412 both sides of each tuber to measure tuber size traits. 413\nThe distribution of mean tuber size (weight and area) from clones in the A08241 414 population is approximately normal but slightly skewed towards larger tubers (Fig. S5). The 415 mean tuber weight of this population as calculated on a per clone basis is estimated to be 6.33 oz 416 but ranged from 1.19 oz (clone 177) to 10.86 oz (clone 074); whereas the coefficient of variation 417 is ~16% of the size average across clones (Fig. 1D). Standard deviation was positively correlated 418 with average tuber size (r2 = 0.37). All measurements of tuber size exhibited high broad sense 419 heritability (h2 > 0.5; Table 2). The heritability of machine vision measurement of tuber 420 characteristics was roughly equivalent to the heritability of manual measurement in every case 421 (Table 2). The standard error of these size measurements decreased as the number of tubers 422 sampled increases but does not exhibit asymptotic behavior at the largest number of tubers 423 sampled (10) suggesting that measuring additional tubers may provide an increasingly accurate 424 estimate of population mean (Fig. S6A). 425 426 Measurement of tuber shape 427 Variation in the shape of the size standard on the black background was small as 428 measured by both aspect ratio (mean: 1.010, standard deviation: 0.004) and eccentricity (mean: 429 0.139, standard deviation: 0.029). Both ordinal scoring (aka SolCAP visual assessment, SVA) of 430 tuber shape and caliper measurement of aspect ratio, were used to quantify tuber shape manually, 431 whereas aspect ratio, eccentricity, and principal components values calculated from tuber 432 biomass profiles were obtained using machine vision techniques. Both manual and machine 433 vision measurements of aspect ratio were highly correlated (r2 > 0.98) whereas the categorical 434 values of SVA showed substantial correlation (r2 = 0.60) but obviously fail to capture the 435 continuous nature of this trait (Fig. 2). The variance explained by principal components (PC) 436 calculated from tuber biomass profiles substantially drops off after the first several PCs (>90% 437 variance explained, Fig. S7). The first PC (PC1shape) captures roughly 42.1% of the shape 438 variation observed and is not correlated with aspect ratio (r2 = 0.001) or SVA (r2 = 0.05) (Fig. 3, 439 Fig. S7). The second PC explains roughly half the variance of PC1shape (PC2shape; 22.1% variance 440 explained) and also does not exhibit correlation with aspect ratio (r2 = -0.08), whereas PC3shape 441 explains 15.6% of the variation and exhibits a significant correlation with aspect ratio (r2 = 0.52) 442 (Fig 3, Fig. S7). Visualizing the variance across these sweeps seems to indicate that PC1shape may 443 describe the variation in tuber thickness at the stem or bud/rose end in this population (Fig. 4a). 444 Examination of tubers exhibiting extreme values along the PC1shape axis supports this conclusion 445 (Fig. 4b). Generally, shape characteristics also exhibited substantial repeatability as measured by 446 correlation between both faces/sides of each tuber. Aspect ratio and eccentricity exhibited the 447 highest correlation between the sides/faces of individual tubers (r2 > 0.98), whereas PC scores 448 derived from tuber biomass profiles exhibited slightly lower correlation (PC1shape > 0.93, PC2shape 449 > 0.78, PC3shape > 0.84). 450 The distribution of mean aspect ratio from clones in the A08241 population is unimodal 451 but likely non-normal and skewed towards larger tubers (Fig. S5). The mean tuber aspect ratio 452 within this population as calculated on a per clone basis is 1.76 but ranged from 1.17 (clone 019) 453 to 2.81 (clone 037); whereas the standard deviation around the mean within each clone averages 454 0.21 across the population. Aspect ratio exhibits substantial heteroskedasticity, as the correlation 455 between trait value and standard deviation is substantially correlated (r2 > 0.57). 456 Broad sense heritability was greatest for SVA (H2 = 0.82), and the heritability of aspect 457 ratio as measured manually (H2 = 0.66) and using machine vision (H2 = 0.65) were almost 458 identical (Table 2). Heritability of tuber biomass profile PCs suggest that the first three PCs may 459\nbe influenced by genetics (all have H2 > 0.14) but little evidence exists for a genetic signal 460 beyond PC4 (all have H2 < 0.11). 461 Substantial differences in variation were observed between traits. SVA exhibited the 462 smallest standard error, whereas aspect ratio and eccentricity expressing a medial value, and 463 PCshape values derived from tuber biomass profiles displayed the largest standard error (Fig. S6b). 464 As observed for the tuber size measurements, the standard error of each measurement type 465 decreased as the number of tubers sampled increased. The rate at which the standard error of 466 SVA, aspect ratio, and eccentricity decrease with additional tubers sampled appears to approach 467 an asymptote after 8 tubers are sampled, suggesting that measurement of additional tubers will 468 provide diminishing returns. 469 470 Measurement of tuber skin and flesh color 471 Colorimetric values derived from a color checker standard (Fig. S8) were compared 472 within and between images acquired using a flatbed scanner (Fig. S9), top-down imaging on the 473 black background (Fig. S10), and top-down imaging on a light box (Fig. S11). Principal 474 component analysis (PCA) was used to perform dimensional reduction across the mean value of 475 each RGB channel and the values of each color chip were compared. The standard deviation 476 (SD) of colorimetric values derived from the color checker along PC1 was almost three times 477 greater on the black background (SD = 0.56), and more than three and a half times larger on the 478 light box (SD = 0.66) relative to the values extracted from the flatbed scanner (SD = 0.19). Color 479 correction of the top-down images collected on the black background and light box reduced the 480 standard deviation substantially (SD = 0.08 and SD = 0.15; respectively). Across all three image 481 acquisition backgrounds, standard deviation was generally largest in magnitude among lighter 482 colors (colors with higher values on each of the R, G, B channels) relative to darker colors 483 (lower RGB values). Along PC1, derived from non-color corrected images, color checker chips 484 19, 5, 4, 23, and 6 were the most variable; whereas variation was minimized for chips 1, 15, 24, 485 12, and 2 (Fig. S8, Table S1). Color correction had a substantial influence on this variation. 486 Within color corrected images chips 6, 1, 9, 20, and 19 exhibited the largest variation along PC1, 487 whereas chips 21, 10, 17, 13, and 24 exhibited the least variation (Fig. S8, Table S1) 488 Color corrected, top-down images of intact tubers placed on a black background and 489 uncorrected images of halved tubers collected using the flatbed scanner were used to assess tuber 490 skin and tuber flesh characteristics. For both tuber skin and tuber flesh, the mean signal value of 491 each tuber contour within the R, G, and B color channels was tabulated and PCA was used to 492 reduce the dimensionality of the data. The proportion of variance captured by PCA decreased 493 rapidly for both tuber skin and flesh color (Fig. S6) with the first PC capturing greater than 87% 494 of the variation in both datasets. Repeatability of skin color, measured as the correlation between 495 values calculated from individual sides/faces of each tuber, was moderate-to-high (PC1skin = 496 0.71, PC2skin = 0.64, PC3skin = 0.82). Repeatability of flesh color measurements could not be 497 calculated, as only a single half of each tuber was imaged. 498 PC1 derived from colorimetric data likely captures the reflective features of both skin and 499 flesh color (Fig. 5). Values of PC1skin and PC1flesh were most highly correlated with L* 500 (lightness) channel from the CIE LAB color space (Table S2). Coloration of tuber skin along 501 PC1 (PC1skin) exhibited a unimodal distribution centered around zero (Fig. S5). Clone 176, 170, 502 172, and 20 can be found at the far right of the PC1skin distribution and had the lightest skin 503 (average values greater than 2.5), whereas clones 088, 058, and 083 exhibited the darkest tuber 504 skin with average PC1skin values less than -2.5 (Fig. 5). PC1 derived from colorimetric values of 505\ntuber flesh (PC1flesh) exhibited a similar distribution, mean, and color trends as was observed for 506 tuber skin. Tubers with the lightest flesh: clones 070, 141, 001 and 022, exhibit average values of 507 PC1flesh greater than 3.3; whereas clones 193, 097, 100, and 078, exhibit the darkest flesh in this 508 population with PC1flesh values less than -2.3 (Fig 5). No clear trends discernable by the human 509 eye were observed along PC2, PC3, etc. for either tuber skin or flesh color. 510 Broad-sense heritability along both PC1skin and PC1flesh measurements was high. PC1skin 511 measurement of tuber color in this population exhibited a broad-sense heritability of 0.49, 512 whereas PC2skin and PC3skin exhibited H2 values of 0.41 and 0.53 respectively. PC1flesh exhibited 513 a broad-sense H2 value of 0.43. This value was lower than the H2 value observed for PC2flesh 514 (0.53) but higher than the value observed for PC3flesh (0.38). 515 Outside of PC3skin, the standard error of the colorimetric measurements decreased as the 516 number of tubers sampled increases (Fig. S6C). The first PC from both skin and flesh tissue 517 captures a majority of the variation in this colorimetric data and also expresses the largest 518 standard error. The reduction of standard error in PC1flesh, PC2flesh, PC3flesh, and PC1skin is not 519 clearly approaching an asymptote, suggesting that measuring additional tuber will provide a 520 better estimate of sample mean. PC2skin and PC3skin on the other hand, exhibit asymptotic 521 behavior after four tubers have been sampled. 522 523 Classification of hollow heart defect 524 A total of 50 individual tubers from 27 clones were identified to exhibit hollow heart defect. 525 The frequency of this defect among affected clones varied with slightly more than half of the 526 affected clones exhibiting a single defective tuber (55%) and a single clone exhibiting 8 hollow 527 heart affected tubers out of 10 total. The CNN model was trained using the parameters in Table 1 528 for 400 epochs. Model accuracy improves and loss decreases with increasing training epochs, 529 indicating that the model is learning and becoming more effective at the task (Fig. 6). However, 530 after around 60 epochs, the trend of both the accuracy and loss appear to plateau, meaning that the 531 model's performance stops improving significantly with more training (Fig. 6). This plateau may 532 occur because the model has reached a local minimum in the loss function and is no longer able to 533 make significant progress on the task, or it may be due to overfitting, where the model is too closely 534 tuned to the specific training data and is not able to generalize well to new, unseen data. This same 535 trend was observed while training the model on all the different resolution datasets. We evaluated 536 the performance of deep learning models on images of different resolutions, with the goal of 537 assessing the generalizability of the models. The model performance in terms of accuracy, loss, 538 confidence score, and inference time are presented in Table 3, and Fig. S12. The results show that 539 training the models on images with a resolution of 512\u00d7512 pixels resulted in the highest accuracy 540 (an average of 99.12% and a maximum of 100%), lowest loss (an average of 0.0366 and a 541 minimum of 0.0027), and highest confidence score (an average of 99.65% and a maximum of 542 100%) when compared to other resolutions. Examples of accurate predictions and common 543 misclassifications observed in models with less than 100% accuracy can be observed in Fig. 7 and 544 Fig. S13 respectively. While the 256\u00d7256 resolution performed well in terms of precision (see 545\nTable 3, Fig. S12), it failed to capture the level of detail necessary for accurate classification. In 546 contrast, using higher resolutions such as 1024\u00d71024 and 1900\u00d71900 pixels did not improve the 547 model performance, possibly due to limitations in the model architecture that made it unsuitable 548 for handling larger images. These findings suggest that there is a trade-off between image 549 resolution and model performance, and choosing the appropriate resolution is crucial for achieving 550 optimal results. In summary, our study highlights the importance of carefully considering the 551\nimage resolution when training deep learning models to ensure their generalizability and 552 performance on a variety of image types. 553 554 555 Discussion 556 This study provides further support to the compendium of evidence suggesting machine 557 vision is a reliable and effective tool to measure many independent phenotypic characteristics of 558 potato tubers (Caraza\u2010Harter & Endelman, 2020; Liu et al., 2021; Miller et al., 2023; Neilson et 559 al., 2021; Rady & Guyer, 2015; Si et al., 2017; Su et al., 2017). To our knowledge, this is the 560 first study that has applied machine vision techniques to estimate tuber size, shape, external and 561 internal colorimetric characteristics as well as classify defects in a replicated, medium-to-large 562 size biparental potato linkage mapping population. Our results indicate that measurement 563 precision of a size standard is maximized when images can be acquired on a non-reflective 564 background, but that choice of background doesn\u2019t contribute as a major source of variation so 565 long as tubers exhibit adequate contrast relative to the background for the purpose of threshold 566 isolation. Estimation of colorimetric values from a color checker standard demonstrates that 567 substantial measurement variation associated with color quantification should be anticipated; and 568 that lighter, more reflective colors will exhibit greater measurement variation relative to darker, 569 less reflective colors. 570 As reported by several other researcher groups (Hasankhani & Navid, 2012; Liu et al., 571 2021; Miller et al., 2023; Neilson et al., 2021; Noordam et al., 2000; Si et al., 2017; Su et al., 572 2017; Zhou et al., 1998), machine vision measurement of size and shape are highly correlated 573 with manual gravimetric, caliper measurement, or index scoring of these characteristics (all 574 characteristics exhibit r2 > 0.9). Although a high correlation between relative tuber area 575 (estimated based upon calibration using a size standard) and gravimetric measurements of tuber 576 size was observed in the A08241 population, this trend may not be as robust in other populations 577 where tuber size exhibits greater variation along the z-axis, which cannot be quantified from the 578 2-dimensional images captured in this study. In the future, these platforms could potentially be 579 improved by incorporating a repeating calibration pattern to improve measurement accuracy 580 (Tabb et al., 2020) and multiple cameras (Tabb et al., 2019) or depth sensors to estimate object 581 length along the z-axis (Liu et al., 2021; Su et al., 2017). 582 Benefits of machine vision measurement are particularly apparent with regards to 583 quantification of tuber shape and colorimetric features. Results from this study suggest that latent 584 traits, like PCs derived from tuber biomass profiles, may capture additional heritable shape 585 characteristics that are independent (uncorrelated with) of aspect ratio typically quantified by 586 ordinal scoring or manual measurement. Colorimetric features are notoriously difficult to 587 quantify and are often described categorically. Although categorical description provides 588 actionable information, this type of ordinal data may not provide adequate resolution for genetic 589 mapping in linkage and association mapping populations like the A08241 population. An 590 additional consideration is that principal component data derived from shape or colorimetric 591 features is experiment specific, meaning that results and conclusions from this study may not be 592 directly relatable to studies performed on other populations unless data are analyzed together as a 593 single dataset. 594 Images are a rich source of quantitative data that can be acquired by non-experts using 595 inexpensive, consumer grade sensors. The total cost to construct the system described is less than 596 $2,000 U.S. dollars and the image data collected for this study was collected by an undergraduate 597\nstudent. Staging of tuber samples is fairly labor intensive so delivery of tubers to the sensor using 598 a conveyor system may greatly enhance throughput. The major benefits of collecting this data type 599 are that researchers can extract and unbiasedly quantify many tuber characteristics simultaneously 600 (far more than could be collected by a human in the same timespan) and the data is long lived, 601 meaning that it can always be revisited later to perform additional analysis (extract new features) 602 after the tubers have been discarded. Features including tuber blemishes, physiological defects, or 603 pathogen disease state can be annotated within image datasets like this one and ultimately used to 604 build classification models to predict the presence of defects with minimal human supervision (Liu 605 & Wang, 2021; Marino et al., 2019; Miller et al., 2023; Moallem et al., 2013; W. Zhang et al., 606 2019). Our study suggests that CNN machine learning techniques are highly effective at 607 classifying the hollow heart defect of potato. The performance of this model was consistent with 608 that of similar studies (Huertas-Tato et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2021; Marino et al., 2019; Moallem et 609 al., 2013; Wang & Xiao, 2021). However, it is worth noting that the model's performance did not 610 improve with an increase in image resolution used for training. This suggests that the model may 611 benefit from additional training data, better architecture, or regularization techniques to improve 612 its generalization performance and reduce overfitting, especially for larger image sizes. Overall, 613 the classification CNN developed in this study demonstrates great potential as a tool for identifying 614 and classifying potatoes with hollow-heart. The resulting image data can also be used to calculate 615 additional latent trait values (combinations of high-dimensional features that define a group of 616 individuals) to better understand how genotypes differ or respond to environmental perturbation 617 (Feldmann et al., 2020; Gage et al., 2019; Ubbens et al., 2020). 618 Trait value distribution and estimates of broad-sense heritability suggest that tuber size, 619 length-width ratio, tuber end thickness (PC1shape), tuber skin (PC1skin) and internal colorimetric 620 features (PC1flesh) are highly heritable and are likely inherited as polygenic traits. Use of machine 621 learning models indicates that identification of tuber defects is also possible given a large and 622 diverse enough training set to build accurate classification models. Application of these methods, 623 combined with modern genotyping techniques and quantitative genetics methods will certainly 624 improve our understanding of the genetic features underlying these traits and may help us better 625 predict the characteristics of offspring in potato breeding populations. 626 627 Conclusions 628 Machine vision measurement of tuber characteristics is an inexpensive, high-throughput 629 method to accurately and unbiasedly quantify size, shape, colorimetric features and quality 630 defects simultaneously. Heritable variation of these characteristics is observed within the 631 A08241 population and the values reported can be directly used for genetic mapping once 632 marker information becomes available for the individual clones. The workflows used to collect 633 this data are well-suited for characterization of early generation breeding material (linkage and 634 association mapping populations) and can be deployed in breeding programs of any size with 635 minimal start up and operating costs. 636 637 Data availability 638 The image datasets collected during this study are available to the public through the 639 USDA National Agricultural Library Ag Data Commons. 640 641 Acknowledgements 642\nThe authors thank Brian Schneider, Darren Hall, Mark Fristad, Ian Fullmer, Jericho Watson, and 643 Russell Elswick USDA-ARS, Aberdeen, ID for their contributions to the collection of data on 644 population A08241 at the Idaho trial site. 645 646 647 Funding 648 The data collection, analysis, interpretation of the data and writing of manuscript was supported 649 by USDA-ARS, Project #2092-21220-003-000-D: Developing New Potatoes with Improved 650 Quality, Disease Resistance, and Nutritional Content, USDA-ARS Project #2050\u201321000-036-651 00D: Genetic Improvement of Potato for Sustainable Production and Enhanced Tuber Qualities 652 for the Western United States in collaboration with the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and 653 Education (ORISE).
