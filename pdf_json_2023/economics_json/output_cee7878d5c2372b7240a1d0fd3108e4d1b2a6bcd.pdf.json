    "abstractText": "Background Costs of informal care are ignored in many cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) conducted from a societal perspective; however, these costs are relevant for lifesaving interventions targeted at the older population. In this study, we estimated informal care costs by age and proximity to death across European regions and showed how these estimates can be included in CEAs. Methods We estimated informal care costs by age and proximity to death using generalised linear mixed-effects models. For this, we selected deceased singles from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement, which we grouped by four European regions. We combined the estimates of informal care costs with life tables to illustrate the impact of including informal care costs on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of a hypothetical intervention that prevents a death at different ages. Results Informal care use, and hence informal care costs, increase when approaching death and with increasing age. The impact of including informal care costs on the ICER varies between \u20ac200 and \u20ac17,700 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. The impact increases with age and is stronger for women and in southern European countries. Conclusion Our estimates of informal care costs facilitate including informal care costs in CEAs of life-extending healthcare interventions. Including these costs may influence decisions as it leads to reranking of life-extending interventions compared with interventions improving quality of life. Key Points for Decision Makers Informal care use, and hence informal care costs, increase when approaching death and with increasing age. The impact of including informal care costs on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a hypothetical intervention that prevents a death at different ages varies between \u20ac200 and \u20ac17,700 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Our findings can be used to include the costs of informal care in economic evaluations of life-extending health care interventions, which may improve health care decision making.

            "text": "Informal care costs are substantial: 0.9\u20135.0% of the Gross Domestic Product in European countries [1]. Many new medical interventions are targeted at older people with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease. Some of these interventions improve survival, thereby also influencing the demand for informal care during the added life-years. However, cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) mostly include public expenditures while ignoring the costs of informal care [2]. As a result, the total costs of these interventions are underestimated. Consequently, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of interventions that increase the burden on informal caregivers looks more favourable than it is.\nThe impact of health care interventions often goes beyond the health care sector. For this reason, CEAs should not only consider the impact of an intervention on the costs within the health care sector but also its costs elsewhere in society [3, 4]. Pharmacoeconomic guidelines such as the Dutch guidelines therefore stipulate including the costs of informal care [5]. However, these costs are still ignored in most CEAs [2] because data on informal care use are often not collected when evaluating specific interventions. Consequently, the impact of a health care intervention on informal care use is unknown.\nStandardised methods facilitate the inclusion of many relevant costs, e.g. unrelated medical costs and costs of non-medical consumption in life-years gained [6\u20138]. A standardised method to include estimates of informal care costs might overcome the issue of data availability. This study therefore estimates the relationship between informal care use and age and proximity to death. These are known predictors of health, and data are readily available in most (modelling) studies that evaluate a health care intervention. This means that our estimates can be used in a standardised way to include informal care costs in CEAs when estimating the cost effectiveness of life-prolonging interventions.\nA simple way to include informal care costs in costeffectiveness studies would be to use estimates of informal care costs by age. Such an approach has been applied when estimating the costs of medical and non-medical consumption of life-prolonging interventions [9, 10]. However, studies on the relationship between age and health care spending suggest this approach would overestimate the costs of life-extending interventions [11]. Average health care spending increases with age, yet this increase is, to a large extent, because at higher ages a larger proportion of the population is in poor health and closer to death. As life-extending interventions increase the share of people alive at older ages, they are thus expected to shift the age\nprofile of health care spending to the right. Some evidence even suggests that lifetime costs decrease because expenditures in the last year of life decrease with age [12, 13]. Additionally, when costs are shifted to later ages, their present value decreases, which lowers their impact on the cost-effectiveness ratio [14].\nTo capture the effect of mortality on the age profile of health care spending, Zweifel et\u00a0al. proposed to estimate health care spending as a function of both age and proximity to death [15]. Once controlling for time to death, the age profile of health care spending becomes almost flat. Since then, many studies have confirmed that the relation between health care spending and age can (at least partially) be explained by proximity of death. This is supported by the finding that health losses and disability are more pronounced in the last years of life [16, 17]. Most of these studies focused on hospital care or medical care [18\u201320]. Research on formal long-term care also found a relation between proximity to death and spending [11, 21\u201324], although the effect of time to death is less strong than in curative care and a significant role of age seems to remain [11, 24].\nAlthough Balia and Brau [25] found a relationship between informal care and proximity to death after controlling for formal long-term care (i.e. paid domestic help), this relationship has been less extensively studied. In this study, we also estimate the relationship between informal care use and age and proximity to death. We do this using longitudinal survey data from single persons in 28 European countries and Israel. The analyses are stratified by region, as the extent to which informal care substitutes for formal care depends on the comprehensiveness of (social) insurance for longterm care and on institutional and cultural differences [26]. By using proximity to death to predict informal care use, we capture the fact that life-prolonging interventions might lead to a postponement of some informal care use. Much informal care use that is used in the years directly preceding death is postponed to higher ages by postponing death. We move beyond prior research by using these estimates to generate profiles of the costs of informal care by age and proximity to death that can be linked to any health economic model that predicts survival."

The focus of the third wave was on life history, which cannot be compared or linked to the questions of the other waves. Data from wave 8 were only used to supplement the information on death.\nRespondents were asked to describe the frequency of informal care received (almost daily, almost every week, almost every month, or less often) from a family member from outside the household, any friend or neighbor with personal care, the household or paperwork, as well as the average number of hours (per day, week, month and year) of informal care received. The latter was asked only in waves 1 and 2. Respondents were also asked to describe whether regular help with personal care was received from someone living within the household. We defined informal care use as a dummy indicator for whether the individual has received informal care from outside the household at least weekly or regular help from someone living within the household,\nand build a continuous variable for the number of hours of informal care received per day.1\nIn waves 1, 2, 4 and 5, the answer on informal care received from outside the household refers to either the respondent or to his/her husband, wife or partner, or to both of them. Therefore, the sample was restricted to individuals who were single across all waves in order to correctly assess the person within a household who received informal care, i.e. the person him or herself instead of his/her husband, wife or partner. The sample was further restricted to individuals with complete data, including a date of death, in order to calculate proximity to death for all individuals. This resulted in 12,239 observations for over 6100 participants.\nTable\u00a01 shows the distribution of responder\u2019s characteristics by wave. In 40.2% of the observations, participants responded to have received informal care from outside the household by a family member, friend, or neighbor at least weekly, or responded to have received regular help from someone from within the household in the 12\u00a0months prior to the interview.\nTable 1 Summary of responders\u2019 characteristics by interview wave\nData are expressed as n\u00a0(%) unless otherwise specified Min; max Minimum; maximum, SD standard deviation a The number of responders in wave 7 is relatively small because many were still alive in the next wave and we selected deceased responders only\nCharacteristic Wave (years)\n1 (2004/2005) [n\u00a0=\u00a02337] 2 (2006/2007) [n\u00a0=\u00a02417] 4 (2010/2011) [n\u00a0=\u00a03008] 5 (2013) [n\u00a0=\u00a02385]\n6 (2015) [n\u00a0=\u00a01884]\n7 (2017) [n\u00a0=\u00a0 208]a\nTotal [n\u00a0=\u00a012,239]\nAge at interview, years \u00a0Mean (SD) 77.0 (10.0) 78.0 (9.8) 78.1 (10.2) 79.7 (10.1) 81.1 (10.1) 84.6 (8.3) 78.8 (10.1) \u00a0Min; max 50.0; 102.0 50.0; 104.0 50.0; 103.0 50.0; 103.0 50.0; 105.0 60.0; 101.0 50.0; 105.0\nWomen 1675 (71.7) 1754 (72.6) 2175 (72.3) 1676 (70.3) 1354 (71.9) 151 (72.6) 8785 (71.8) Time to death \u00a0\u2264\u00a05\u00a0years 875 (37.4) 1056 (43.7) 1864 (62.0) 1948 (81.7) 1876 (99.6) 208 (100.0) 7827 (64.0) \u00a0>\u00a05\u00a0years 1462 (62.6) 1361 (56.3) 1144 (38.0) 437 (18.3) 8 (0.4) 0 (0.0) 4412 (36.0)\nHousehold size \u00a01 1853 (79.3) 1860 (77.0) 2290 (76.1) 1889 (79.2) 1455 (77.2) 162 (77.9) 9509 (77.7) \u00a0>\u00a01 484 (20.7) 557 (23.0) 718 (23.9) 496 (20.8) 429 (22.8) 46 (22.1) 2730 (22.3)\nEuropean country\u2014region \u00a0Nordic 590 (25.2) 542 (22.4) 248 (8.2) 331 (13.9) 225 (11.9) 44 (21.2) 1980 (16.2) \u00a0Western 760 (32.5) 658 (27.2) 953 (31.7) 788 (33.0) 512 (27.2) 61 (29.3) 3732 (30.5) \u00a0Southern 987 (42.2) 864 (35.7) 427 (14.2) 468 (19.6) 465 (24.7) 71 (34.1) 3282 (26.8) \u00a0Eastern 0 (0.0) 353 (14.6) 1380 (45.9) 798 (33.5) 682 (36.2) 32 (15.4) 3245 (26.5)\nInformal care use 856 (36.6) 856 (35.4) 1242 (41.3) 971 (40.7) 887 (47.1) 110 (52.9) 4922 (40.2)\n1 Due to poor accuracy in the responses, those individuals who reported having received more than 16\u00a0h of care per day have been set to 16\u00a0h of care from each helper.\nThe probability of using informal care at least weekly increased with age (55.3% among those aged 85+\u00a0years) (Fig.\u00a01a) and proximity to death (51.6% among those who died in the same year of the interview) (Fig.\u00a01b).

            "text": "To include informal care costs in cost-effectiveness studies, we needed to estimate both the probability of any use and the (conditional) number of hours used as a function of proximity to death, age and gender. We used a two-step approach. First, we estimated the probability of using informal care at least weekly, and second, we estimated the daily number of hours of informal care use among persons who used informal care. This approach is in line with previous studies [18, 20]. In both models, we included gender, age and proximity to death as predictors. Proximity to death was calculated as the difference between month and year of death and month and year of the interview.\nFor the first step, logistic random effects regression analyses were employed to estimate the probability of using informal care at least weekly. To grasp the importance of the inclusion of proximity to death in explaining informal care use, we first estimated a model only including gender and age as explanatory variables. In a second model, we then added proximity to death. A comparison of the age profiles in the two models provided an indication of how much of the relation between informal care use and age observed in a simple model is caused by the strong correlation between age and death. The resulting models are shown in Eqs.\u00a01 and 2:\nwhere p is the probability of informal care use at least weekly; \u03b1i is the subject-specific intercept (random-effect); A is the responder age; A2 is age squared; S is the responder sex; TTD is the time to death; i is the index of the individual; and t is the index of the wave.\nFor the second step, the same explanatory variables were used to estimate the number of daily hours of informal care. As this outcome is a count variable, negative binomial regression models were used. The quadratic term of age was not significant, indicating that the relationship between age and number of informal care hours was not curvilinear and therefore it was not included in Eqs.\u00a03 and 4.\n(1)Model 1 \u2236 ln ( pit\u22151\u2212pit ) = i + 1Sit + 2Ait + 3A 2 it\n(2) Model 2 \u2236 ln\n( pit\u22151\u2212pit ) = i + 1Sit + 2Ait + 3A 2 it + 4TTDit\n(3)Model 1 \u2236 ln(n\u25e6 hours) = i + 1Sit + 2Ait\n(4)Model 2 \u2236 ln(n\u25e6 hours) = i + 1Sit + 2Ait + 3TTDit\nWhile wave 1 and 2 from SHARE contained information on the number of hours of informal care use from outside the household, this information was no longer available in subsequent waves. These latter two models were therefore based on data from waves 1 and 2 only.\nThe relationship between informal care use and functional limitations strongly differs across countries, as it depends on cultural norms and public policy that influence the availability of (publicly subsidised) long-term care [25, 36]. Since proximity to death is strongly correlated with functional limitations [24], it is likely that the relationship between proximity to death and informal care use is also influenced\n(using Eq.\u00a04) given certain ages and proximity death, separately for men and women.\nWe valued informal care with country-specific standard rates of formal caregivers providing similar activities, namely: Sweden for northern Europe (\u20ac16.63/h), The Netherlands for western Europe (\u20ac13.79/h), Spain for southern Europe (\u20ac11.24/h) and Hungary for eastern Europe (\u20ac4.06/h) [1]. Prices were inflated to 2021 levels [37]. To evaluate the impact of including informal care costs on the ICER, we followed the approach by Kellerborg et\u00a0al. [38]. An ICER that considers informal care costs, besides the costs within health care and the costs within other sectors, is calculated as shown in Eq.\u00a05:\nwhere the last term represents the effect on the ICER of including the costs of informal care. We estimated this effect by using a hypothetical intervention that prevents a death at different ages without any intervention costs (reducing Eq.\u00a05 to the last term only). To estimate the impact on the ICER of the costs of informal care for an intervention that prevents a death at age a, we use the following equation (Eq.\u00a06):\nwhere the numerator equals the informal care costs at a given age a and TTD t multiplied by L(a, t) , which is the number of people alive at a given age a and TTD t, summed over age (denoted by the index a) and TTD (denoted by the index t). The denominator is the average quality of life at age a multiplied by the number of people alive at age a, summed over all ages. The ICERs as calculated using Eq.\u00a06 can be interpreted as the cost effectiveness of a hypothetical intervention in which a death at a certain age is prevented at zero intervention costs. Previous research has shown that such ICERs give a good indication of what the impact is of including future costs on the ICER of non-hypothetical interventions [7, 9].\nEstimates of L(a) and L(a, t) are based on a life table, and on 1-year mortality rates obtained from the Human Mortality Database [39]. Life tables for The Netherlands (2020), Spain (2018), Sweden (2019) and Hungary (2020) were used for western, southern, northern and eastern European countries, respectively [39]. Age-specific estimates of QoL(a) were derived from country-specific individual-level EQ-5D survey data, but using the Dutch value set [40].

All analyses were therefore stratified by European region. In line with Bolin et\u00a0al. [26], we distinguished between northern, western and southern European countries and added eastern European countries. The countries included within these regions were: northern Europe (Finland, Denmark, Sweden), western Europe (Austria, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Belgium, Luxemburg, and Netherlands), southern Europe/Mediterranean area (Spain, Greece, Portugal, Cyprus, Malta, Israel and Italy) and eastern Europe (Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia, Croatia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Romania, Slovakia)."

These profiles may be used in CEAs of healthcare interventions and thus contribute to a more complete estimate of the incremental cost-effectiveness of these interventions.\nA role of proximity to death in explaining the age pattern in health care spending has been found in almost all studies. However, the magnitude of the effect differs widely across different types of expenditures: expenditures in hospital care depend on proximity to death rather than age, while\nin long-term care age and disability seem to play a distinct role from mortality [11]. These differences are related to the different aims (curing versus caring) and the relevance of different dimensions of health, of which not all have the same relation with mortality (prevalence of [lethal] diseases versus functioning and disability). Our results show that proximity to death is an important predictor of informal care use, but that a separate role for age remains. Given that informal care has, to some extent, similar aims as formal long-term care, and both forms of care are to some extent substitutes [42], these results are in line with expectations."

            "text": "Gheorghe et\u00a0al. also aimed to overcome the poor availability of informal care data by predicting informal care use with data that are often available to health economic researchers [43]. In contrast to our approach, they used EQ-5D scores of patients to estimate informal care use. We think our approach is complementary to theirs, with their estimates being useful in studies where interventions do not extend life (i.e. interventions that only or also have a strong impact on morbidities that are less lethal), while our estimates are useful in studies of interventions that extend life.\nIdeally, the burden on informal caregivers in terms of the time spent on caregiving is measured using a diary in which caregivers record the time they spend on caregiving, or using a questionnaire where caregivers are retrospectively asked about the time spent on care tasks [44]. However, data from these sources are not always available when evaluating specific interventions or diseases. If data are available for instance from a trial with a short follow-up, these can be combined with our estimates if a model is used to extrapolate findings from that trial in a cost-effectiveness study. More generally, frameworks are available to combine more detailed cost data from other studies with estimates such as presented in this paper that represent averages per capita instead of estimates for specific patient groups [7, 45].\nTraditionally, researchers either use foregone wages or the wage rate of a formal caregiver to assess opportunity costs. Many informal caregivers are retired and hence foregone wages based on the respondent\u2019s wage or the wages of those with a similar age likely underestimate these opportunity costs because many have zero\nearnings. Because we only knew the caregiver\u2019s relation to the recipient of care and, in the case of children, their age and gender, we were unable to value informal care using the wage rate of the informal carer on the labour market. Hence, we used the proxy good method to estimate the costs of informal care to give insight into the possible impact of including informal care costs on the ICER. Others who use our estimates of informal care use by age and time to death can value informal care differently, for example by using wage rates when this information is available to them.\nAnother strand of research studied how to measure care-related quality of life in informal caregivers [46, 47], and how to value the outcomes to include care-related quality of life in CEAs [47, 48]. While such studies are relevant and promising, including the impact of informal care in CEAs on the cost side seems more straightforward."

            "text": "Similar to our approach, standardised methods have been developed to facilitate the inclusion of unrelated medical costs and costs of non-medical consumption in life-years gained in CEAs [6, 7]. Mokri et\u00a0al. estimated future medical and non-medical costs and their impact on the ICER of life-prolonging interventions across five European countries [8]. They found that future medical costs in The Netherlands, Germany and the UK are large compared with future medical costs in Spain and Greece. Conversely, we found that informal care use in western European countries, including The Netherlands and Germany, are low compared with southern European countries, including Spain and Greece. A possible explanation for this difference is that formal and informal care are to some extent substitutes [26]. Consequently, the impact of including informal care costs compared with the impact of including future medical costs on the ICER of a hypothetical intervention that prevents a death at different ages is higher in Spain but lower in The Netherlands. For example, Mokri et\u00a0al. found that the impact of including future medical costs on the ICER of a hypothetical intervention that prevents a death at age 75\u00a0years in Spain or The Netherlands is estimated to be \u20ac4900 or \u20ac18,800, respectively [8]. In comparison, we estimated that the impact of including informal care costs on the ICER of a hypothetical intervention that prevents a death at age 80\u00a0years is \u20ac8200 in men and \u20ac10,700 in women in southern European countries, and \u20ac3100 in men and \u20ac4500 in women in western European countries.\nFig. 2 Predicted informal care hours/week in European countries by gender: a Western European countries; b Southern European countries; c Northern European countries; and d Eastern European countries\n\u25c2"

            "text": "This study is subject to several limitations related to the data. First, the number of cases with complete information on date of death and informal care receipt is only 3.6% (12,239 of 336,601) because of incomplete information about informal care within the household, and because the exit interview after death with relatives was available only in a few cases. A consequence of the incomplete information about informal care within the household was that we had to rely on data from singles only, while singles tend to have poorer health than couples. We believe this is not necessarily a problem if these effects are captured by the proxies for health in the models (age and TTD). Furthermore, the undersampling of people in a nursing home is a limitation. Together, these data limitations mean that the data are likely not representative for the full populations of the countries that we included. However, since the number of single adult households is increasing in the European Union [49], singles are an important group to analyse for policy purposes.\nA further limitation is that while waves 1 and 2 from SHARE contained information on the number of hours of informal care from outside the household, this information was no longer available in subsequent waves, and we had to assume that this information from the first two waves is representative for help from outside and inside the household in subsequent waves."

            "text": "Our findings can be used to include the costs of informal care in economic evaluations of life-extending health care interventions when data on informal care use by disease are lacking. Since our estimates are not disease-specific, they are probably most useful in studies of interventions that extend life. They are easy to incorporate in any health economic model of the cost effectiveness of health care interventions that predicts survival and incorporates data on the number of people who have died over time. Including these costs will have a large impact and will lead to reranking of life-extending interventions compared with interventions that improve quality of life.\nAcknowledgements This paper uses data from SHARE Waves 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 (DOIs:\u00a0https:// doi. org/ 10. 6103/ SHARE. w1. 800, https:// doi. org/ 10. 6103/ SHARE. w2. 800, https:// doi. org/ 10. 6103/ SHARE. w4. 800, https:// doi. org/ 10. 6103/ SHARE. w5. 800, https:// doi. org/ 10. 6103/ SHARE. w6. 800, https:// doi. org/ 10. 6103/ SHARE. w7. 800, https:// doi. org/ 10. 6103/ SHARE. w8. 800, https:// doi. org/ 10. 6103/ SHARE. w8ca. 800), see B\u00f6rsch-Supan et\u00a0al.
