Large quantities of solutions containing oxalic acid and nitric acid are produced from nuclear fuel reprocessing, but oxalic acid must be removed before nitric acid and plutonium ions can be recovered in these solutions. The degradation of oxalic acid with Pt/SiO2 as a catalyst in nitric acid solutions has the characteristics of a fast and stable reaction, recyclable catalyst, and no conclusions The reaction process of oxalic acid degradation in nitric acid solutions with Pt/SiO2 as a catalyst was investigated and described. Strictly speaking, it is difficult to nd evidence of oxalic acid degradation from catalytic reactions involving nitrous acid, given that nitrous acid concentrations in nitric acid solutions are generally 102–3 times smaller than NO3 −. The oxidation intermediates that can be produced by the reaction between nitrous acid and nano-platinum are still uncertain, but nitrous acid did not affect the experimental results in this work. In industrial production, it is necessary to take into account that certain substances poison the catalyst, and that this substance is continuously produced from the irradiated decomposition of an extractive agent containing phosphorus in solution.
