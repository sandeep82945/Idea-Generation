    "abstractText": "Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to multi-carbon products would simultaneously reduce CO2 emission and produce high-value chemicals. Herein, we report Cu electrodes modified by metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) exhibiting enhanced electrocatalytic performance to convert CO2 into ethylene and ethanol. The Zr-based MOF, UiO-66 would in situ transform into amorphous ZrOx nanoparticles (a-ZrOx), constructing a-ZrOx/Cu hetero-interface as a dual-site catalyst. The Faradaic efficiency of multi-carbon (C2+) products for optimal UiO-66-coated Cu (0.5-UiO/Cu) electrode reaches a high value of 74% at \u2212 1.05 V versus RHE. The intrinsic activity for C2+ products on 0.5-UiO/Cu electrode is about two times higher than that of Cu foil. In situ surface-enhanced Raman spectra demonstrate that UiO-66-derived a-ZrOx coating can promote the stabilization of atop-bound CO* intermediates on Cu surface during CO2 electrolysis, leading to increased CO* coverage and facilitating the C\u2013C coupling process. The present study gives new insights into tailoring the adsorption configurations of CO2RR intermediate by designing dual-site electrocatalysts with hetero-interfaces.",

            "text": "The exploitation and utilization of fossil fuels have led to excessive emissions of CO2, which break the carbon cycle in nature and cause serious environmental problems [1]. Hence, it is urgent to develop efficient technologies to convert CO2 into valuable fuels and chemicals, especially into C2+ products with high energy density and high value [2\u20137]. Among all potential technologies, CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) driven by renewable electric energy is practically appealing to realize a benign closedcarbon cycle. However, tremendous challenges, such as high overpotentials, low selectivity, and unsatisfactory long-term stability, have limited the large-scale application of CO2RR. Designing advanced electrocatalysts with high performance is the key to overcome these obstacles.\nCu-based materials, with a proper CO adsorption energy, are the most popular catalysts that can convert CO2 into C2+ products with non-negligible selectivity [3, 8, 9]. However, unitary Cu-based catalysts generally show unsatisfied selectivity toward C2+ products due to the limitation of scaling relations [10\u201312]. Developing dual-site catalysts by incorporating the second component, either organic or inorganic moieties, offers new freedom to regulate the adsorption energies of intermediates and modulate the product distribution. For instance, Cu catalysts modified by organic species such as amino acid [13] and polyamine [14\u201316] exhibited excellent catalytic performance for C2+ products. Cu-based bimetallic catalysts with Bi, Au, Ru, and Pd as second binding sites can tune the adsorption of CO* and promote the conversion of CO2 to alcohols [17\u201319]. Introducing metal elements such as Al with empty orbital to the Cu oxide can stabilize the positive valence state of Cu which is beneficial for the production of C2H4 [20]. Moreover, metal oxides, such as zinc oxide [21\u201324], ceria [25\u201328], alumina [29], zirconia [30], and silica [31] have also been utilized to construct hetero-interfaces with Cu to promote the C2+ selectivity of Cu by multiple interfacial effects [32, 33]. Therefore, we envisage that using proper promoters to active CO2 molecules or\u00a0to stabilize the adsorbed CO* intermediates on Cu electrodes would increase the coverage of CO* and facilitate the subsequent dimerization into C2+ products [16, 34].\nMetal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) with abundant coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUSs) and porous structure are promising candidates for CO2RR [35\u201337]. The coordinatively unsaturated metal sites in MOFs, with strong Lewis acidity, can interact with O atom in CO2 molecules by the Lewis acid\u2013base interaction to activate linear CO2 molecules, and thus promote the CO2 electrolysis [29, 38, 39]. Inspired by the development of dual-site catalysts to steer the catalytic performance of Cu, we envision that constructing a hetero-interface of MOFs and Cu may enhance the CO2RR performance. To check this suppose, UiO-66 with abundant Lewis-acidic Zr sites [40] was used to modify Cu foil by a drop-coating method. During the CO2 electrolysis, the UiO-66 nanoparticles transform into a-ZrOx by losing most of the organic ligands, thereby exposing more coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites. In effect, a-ZrOx/Cu hetero-interfaces were formed on the electrode during CO2 electroreduction. As a result, a significantly enhanced CO2RR performance (Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 74% for C2+) has been observed on UiO-66 modified Cu electrode. In\u00a0situ surface-enhanced Raman spectra revealed that a-ZrOx coating can obviously stabilize the CO* intermediate adsorbed at top sites on the Cu surface, which can increase the coverage of CO* and promote the C\u2013C coupling process."

Then, H2BDC (2.06\u00a0mmol) with an equimolar ratio with respect to ZrCl4 was added to the above solution and dissolved by stirring for 30\u00a0min. The obtained solution was transferred into a Teflon liner (100\u00a0mL) which was sealed in an autoclave. The tightly capped autoclave was placed in an oven at 120\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h. After cooling to room temperature, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed three times with DMF and methanol, respectively. And the as-synthesized UiO-66 was soaked in methanol for three days to exchange DMF. Finally, the as-synthesized UiO-66 was dried at 60\u00a0\u00b0C overnight.\nThe size of UiO-66 can be regulated by tuning the equivalent of HBC.

At first, the UiO-66 nanoparticles with a size of 100\u2013200\u00a0nm were synthesized by a hydrothermal method (Fig. S4a) and dispersed in a mixture solution of Nafion, alcohol, and deionized (DI) water. The Cu foil was mechanically polished to remove surface impurities (Fig. S4b). The dispersion of UiO-66 was then dropped on the polished Cu foil to form a uniform UiO-66 coating layer on the surface of Cu foil (Fig.\u00a01a). From cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image and EDS mapping, the porous UiO-66 layer with a thickness of 1.5\u00a0\u03bcm on top of Cu substrate can be clearly identified (Fig.\u00a01b). The thickness of UiO-66 layer can be adjusted by changing the loading of UiO-66, which might affect the transport of reactants as discussed shortly. Interestingly, the acidic UiO-66 suspension would induce roughening of the Cu surface and formation of well-defined cubic nanoparticles during the preparation\n(2)ECSA = Rf \u00d7 S\n1 3\nof electrode (Fig.\u00a01c). XRD was performed to determine the crystal phase of the cubic nanoparticles. As shown in Fig.\u00a01d, diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern of 0.5-UiO/ Cu electrode can be well assigned to UiO-66 and Cu. When UiO-66 layer was removed to expose the reconstructed Cu surface (sample denoted as 0.5-UiO/Cu-bare), an additional diffraction peak corresponding to Cu2O emerged, implying that UiO-66 promotes the formation of Cu2O on Cu foil by an oxygen-consuming corrosion process. Thus, the welldefined cubic nanoparticles were identified as Cu2O.\nThe Cu LMM Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) of 0.5- UiO/Cu-bare was also carried out to determine the chemical state of Cu. In Fig. S5, the Cu+ species was dominant, which was consistent with the results of XRD. Moreover, XPS spectra of C 1s and O 1s for 0.5-UiO/Cu were presented\nin Fig. S6a\u2013b to confirm the composition of surface coating. Five peaks with binding energies of 284.8\u00a0eV (C\u2013C), 286\u00a0eV (C\u2013O), 289.5\u00a0eV (C=O), 291.9\u00a0eV (CF2), and 293.7\u00a0eV (CF3) were presented in C 1s XPS spectrum of 0.5-UiO/Cu [42]. The C\u2013F bonds originated from Nafion, which acted as a binder for UiO-66 nanoparticles. Other bonds were attributed to the ligands of UiO-66. Apart from primary peaks at 535.4 and 533.4\u00a0eV, which are attributed to SO3H and O\u2013C=O, respectively, secondary peaks assigned to Zr\u2013O and Zr\u2013OH bonds also existed in the O 1s XPS spectra [43\u201345].

Moreover, the partial current densities for C2+ products\n1 3\nare obviously increased after modifying the Cu electrode with UiO-66, indicating that UiO-66 may promote the C\u2013C coupling process. Given that the surface reconstruction process induced by UiO-66 coating would hugely increase the surface roughness of Cu foil, we estimated the ECSA corrected current densities of Cu and 0.5-UiO/Cu electrodes. The ECSA of 0.5-UiO/Cu was notably increased to 6.95 times that of pristine Cu foil, as shown in Fig. S7a\u2013b and Table\u00a0S1, which is consistent with the observed rough surface. Even after deducting the benefit of enlarged surface area, the 0.5-UiO/Cu exhibited a notably increased ECSAcorrected current density of 3.82\u00a0mA\u00a0 cm\u22122 for C2+ products at \u2212 1.05\u00a0V versus RHE, which is about two times higher than that of Cu foil. The ECSA-corrected current densities for H2 and C1 products on 0.5-UiO/Cu were significantly decreased at selected potential range from \u2212 0.85 to \u2212 1.1\u00a0V versus RHE. Therefore, the 0.5-UiO/Cu possesses a better intrinsic activity for C2+ products, and the competing reactions toward H2 and C1 products are substantially inhibited upon UiO-66 modification (Fig. S7c-d).\nExcept for the catalytic activity, the UiO-66 modification also has the capability of steering the product distribution of CO2RR on Cu (Figs.\u00a02b and S8). The major products of CO2RR on Cu foil were altered from H2 and C1 products to C2+ products after the modification of UiO-66. The 0.5- UiO/Cu electrode reaches the maximum FEC2+ of 74% at \u2212 1.05\u00a0V versus RHE, which is about 3.6 times higher than that on Cu foil (Fig.\u00a02c). Moreover, the onset potential for C2+ products shifts from \u2212 0.95\u00a0V versus RHE on Cu to \u2212 0.85\u00a0V versus RHE on 0.5-UiO/Cu, demonstrating the promotion of C\u2013C coupling by UiO-66 modification. Benefiting from the enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity of C2+ products, the formation rate (r) for C2+ products on 0.5-UiO/Cu was 13 times higher than that on Cu at \u2212 1.05\u00a0V versus RHE, indicating that UiO-66 modification significantly promotes the C2+ production on Cu foil (Fig. S9).\nCompared with the state-of-the-art Cu-based catalysts evaluated in H-type cell [10, 15, 27, 48\u201356], the MOFmodified Cu electrode showed a competitive catalytic performance in terms of activity (\u2212 26.57\u00a0mA\u00a0 cm\u22122) and selectivity (74%) toward C2+ products at \u2212 1.05\u00a0V versus RHE (Fig.\u00a02d). As shown in Table\u00a0S2, the formation rate of CO2-to-C2+ products on 0.5-UiO/Cu reached 228.08\u00a0mol\u00a0 s\u22121\u00a0 m\u22122, which was higher than most Cu-based catalysts. Moreover, the stability of MOF-modified Cu electrode is also superior to most reported catalysts. As shown\nin Fig.\u00a02e, the working potential and the FEs for C2+ products were maintained at about \u2212 1.00\u00a0V versus RHE and 60%, respectively, during an operating period of 32\u00a0h at \u2212 30\u00a0mA\u00a0 cm\u22122. The remarkable stability of 0.5-UiO/Cu at a high current density could be related to the high intrinsic stability of the in\u00a0situ formed a-ZrOx/Cu interfacial active sites, in contrast to catalytic sites generated by ex situ approaches such as thermal [57] or plasma [58, 59] pretreatments. All in all, the dramatic enhancement of electrocatalytic CO2 conversion toward C2+ products demonstrates the superiority of constructing dual-site catalysts using MOFs for CO2RR."

            "text": "Detailed characterizations were conducted to explore the real structure of MOF-modified Cu electrode during CO2 electrolysis. SEM images show that the UiO-66 nanoparticles start to collapse and adhere together after CV test and then progress to severe adhesions after CA test (Figs.\u00a03a and S10a). Meanwhile, the reconstructed Cu surface became rougher after CA test, which may lead to more heterointerfaces and stronger interface interaction (Fig. S10b\u2013c). The morphological evolution of surface coating implies the collapse of UiO-66 structure. Thus, XRD analysis was performed on the surface layer collected from the 0.5-UiO/ Cu electrodes after the CV test (denoted as 0.5-UiO/Cu-CV NPs) or the CA test (denoted as 0.5-UiO/Cu-CA NPs). As shown in Fig.\u00a03b, the XRD peaks of UiO-66 diminished after the CV and disappeared after the CA test, indicating that the highly periodic arrangements of UiO-66 were destroyed. The decomposition of UiO-66 was also confirmed by FT-IR analysis of the 0.5-UiO/Cu-CA NPs (Fig.\u00a03c). The peaks at 1578, 1398 and 1504\u00a0 cm\u22121, which can be assigned to asymmetric stretching, symmetric stretching of carboxylate groups (O\u2013C=O), and vibration of C=C bond in benzene ring, respectively, were almost disappeared after the CA test, indicating the loss of ligands during CO2 electrolysis [45, 60]. The peaks located at 980\u20131220\u00a0 cm\u22121 in the FT-IR spectra of 0.5-UiO/Cu NPs (surface layer collected from fresh electrode) are attributed to the main vibrational peaks of Nafion binder [61]. Moreover, ex situ XPS was performed on 0.5-UiO/Cu electrode to investigate the change of surface composition during CO2RR. As shown in Fig. S11, the signals of C and O assigned to ligands (C=O, C\u2013O, C\u2013C)\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-022-00879-5\u00a9 The authors\nwere obviously weakened while the Zr-O-Zr component was strengthened compared with pristine electrode (Fig. S6), indicating the increased inorganic components and decreased organic components in the surface layer after CO2 electrolysis.\nTEM was used to investigate the surface layer of the MOFmodified Cu electrode. Figure\u00a03d depicts a typical UiO-66-derived nanoparticle collected from the 0.5-UiO/Cu electrode\nafter CA test, and the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset of Fig.\u00a03d) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig.\u00a03e) reveal its amorphous nature. On the basis of above characterizations, we can conclude that the UiO-66 nanoparticles transform into amorphous ZrOx (a-ZrOx) nanoparticles with residual ligands during CO2RR, forming an a-ZrOx-modified Cu electrode. As shown in Fig.\u00a03f, a clear interfacial boundary can be found between a\n1 3\ncrystalline and an amorphous phase. The lattice fringes with spacing of 0.21\u00a0nm in the crystalline region correspond to the (111) plane of Cu, while the amorphous region could be assigned to the ZrOx component. The intimate contact of the two phases forms robust a-ZrOx/Cu hetero-interfaces in the 0.5-UiO/Cu electrode during CO2RR, which serve as potential catalytic active sites for CO2 conversion.\nTo elucidate the roles of UiO-66 on the CO2RR performance, a series of control experiments were performed. Firstly, UiO-66 itself does not exhibit any catalytic performance toward CO2RR (Fig.\u00a03g). Secondly, considering that oxide-derived Cu possesses a better catalytic performance for CO2RR toward C2+ products than conventional Cu [57, 62\u201364], we assessed the catalytic performance of 0.5-UiO/ Cu-bare electrode with Cu2O on the surface. As expected, 0.5-UiO/Cu-bare achieved an improved FE for C2+ products at \u2212 1.05\u00a0V versus RHE compared with Cu foil (Fig.\u00a03g). However, the FEs of C2+ products on 0.5-UiO/Cu-bare (43%) were still much lower than that on 0.5-UiO/Cu (74%), which confirmed that the in\u00a0situ formed a-ZrOx/Cu interfaces played an important role.\nFurthermore, the density of a-ZrOx/Cu interface has been adjusted by changing the loading and size of UiO-66. As shown in Fig.\u00a03h, the FEs of C2+ products as a function of UiO-66 loadings exhibited a volcano-shaped tendency. Low loading of UiO-66 (such as 0.1-UiO/Cu) may lead to insufficient a-ZrOx/Cu interfaces, while thick coating layer may block the mass transport of CO2. Thus, 0.5-UiO/Cu with an intermediate loading achieved the optimal selectivity for CO2RR toward C2+ products. In addition, the catalytic activities in terms of current density for CO2RR on X-UiO/Cu increased with increasing loading of UiO-66, which followed the tendency of ECSA for X-UiO/Cu. In addition, increasing the size of UiO-66 decreased the FE for C2+ products on UiO/Cu electrodes as shown in Fig.\u00a03i, which could be explained by the fewer contact points between the large UiO66-derived a-ZrOx and Cu. Combining characterizations and control experiments, the evolution process of UiO-66 coating under CO2 electrolysis is schematically presented in Fig. S12."

            "text": "The modification of UiO-66 on Cu foil may regulate the CO2RR process by the following two possible mechanisms: (i) in\u00a0situ electroreduction formed a-ZrOx may stabilize Cu+\nsites, and thus enhance the selectivity toward C2+ products; (ii) the loss of ligands of UiO-66 under negative potential may expose a large amount of coordination-unsaturated Zr sites, which can interact with CO2 molecule and steer adsorption mode of CO* intermediates, and thus promote the CO2 activation and C2+ products formation. To investigate the real reaction mechanism of CO2RR on UiO-66 modified Cu electrode, in\u00a0situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy was carried out. Figure\u00a04a\u2013b displayed the Raman bands between 100 and 700\u00a0 cm\u22121, where the signals can be assigned to CuOx and UiO-66 [65, 66]. For UiO/ Cu-bare and UiO/Cu, a similar evolution trend of Cu2O was observed under CO2 electrolysis. When a negative potential was applied, the pristine CuOx signals existing at the open-circuit potential (OCP) became weakened. However, the weak signals for CuOx persisted under a wide potential window without obvious discrepancy on UiO/Cu-bare and UiO/Cu. In addition, three bands assigned to UiO-66 between 100 and 700\u00a0 cm\u22121 at OCP on UiO/Cu disappeared under negative potential, in line with the decomposition of UiO-66 revealed by the ex situ characterizations. There is no indication that UiO-66 or a-ZrOx could stabilize the Cu+ species under CO2RR condition. We thus exclude the possibility that the enhancement of C2+ selectivity comes from the stabilization of Cu+.\nAfter ruling out the effect of Cu+, in\u00a0situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy also helped to explore the evolution of adsorption mode of CO2RR intermediate during CO2 electrolysis. The Raman bands at 283, 350 and 2070\u00a0 cm\u22121 are assigned to the restricted rotation of adsorbed CO* on Cu, Cu\u2212CO stretching, and atop C\u2261O stretching (COatop), respectively. A visible difference of CO* related peaks can be observed on Cu foil, UiO/Cu-bare, and UiO/Cu. For Cu foil, the signals of CO* at low frequencies between 200 and 400\u00a0 cm\u22121 cannot be observed (Fig. S13a). The COatop signal appeared at \u2212 0.4\u00a0V versus RHE on Cu foil, which was less discernible compared with UiO/Cu-bare and UiO/Cu (Fig. S13b). As depicted in Fig.\u00a04a\u2013b, the restricted rotation of adsorbed CO* on Cu and Cu\u2212CO stretching appeared at \u2212 0.6\u00a0V versus RHE on UiO/Cu-bare, which is more negative than that on UiO/Cu (\u2212 0.2\u00a0V vs. RHE). In Fig.\u00a04c\u2013d, the signal of COatop at 2070\u00a0 cm\u22121 exhibited a similar convex trend on UiO/Cu-bare and UiO/Cu as the potential shifted negatively, probably corresponding to the accumulation and consumption of CO* [67]. Interestingly, the intensity of COatop signal on UiO/Cu was much higher than that on UiO/\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-022-00879-5\u00a9 The authors\nCu-bare, indicating that UiO-66-derived a-ZrO2 can stabilize atop-bound CO* intermediates, which are generally believed to promote the C\u2013C coupling process [68].\nOn the basis of our spectroscopic results and literature reports, we speculated that the relatively low CO* density on the surface hinders the CO* coupling process on Cu electrode (Fig.\u00a04e). However, the in\u00a0situ formed a-ZrOx with abundant Lewis-acidic sites may activate inert CO2 and stabilize CO* intermediates by Lewis acid\u2013base interaction [29, 38, 39], thus improving the probability of CO* coupling and producing more multi-carbon products (Fig.\u00a04f). Nevertheless, more detailed experimental characterizations and/or computational efforts would be necessary to fully understand the mechanism."

            "text": "In summary, we report that Cu electrodes modified with UiO-66 nanoparticles would catalyze the CO2 electroreduction into C2+ products with enhanced activity and selectivity. The UiO-66 nanoparticles would decompose into amorphous ZrOx with abundant Lewis-acidic sites during\nelectrolysis, in\u00a0situ constructing an amorphous ZrOx/Cu hetero-interface as dual-site catalyst. The optimal UiO66-modified Cu electrode delivered an excellent selectivity of 74% for C2+ products, which was about 3.6 times higher than that for Cu electrode, as well as superior durability up to 32\u00a0h. In\u00a0situ surface-enhanced Raman spectra indicate that the UiO-66-derived a-ZrOx coating can promote the adsorption of atop-bound *CO intermediate, and thus facilitate the C\u2013C coupling process. Constructing a robust hetero-interface opens up a new route to steer the adsorbed mode of intermediate and thus modulate the product selectivity. We believe that such a strategy would shed light on the design of other advanced electrocatalysts for efficient CO2RR.\nAcknowledgements H.B.W. acknowledges the funding support from Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (Grant No. LR21E020003), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 22005266), and \u201cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities\u201d (2021FZZX001-09).
