1. **Investigate the role of proton tunneling in the rate-limiting proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) step of photosynthetic water oxidation.** This could be done using computational methods, such as molecular dynamics simulations, to calculate the tunneling probability and its contribution to the activation energy.
2. **Study the effects of mutations in the protein-internal hydrogen-bond network (HBN) on the rate of photosynthetic water oxidation.** This could be done by introducing specific mutations into the HBN and measuring the rate of water oxidation in the mutant proteins.
3. **Investigate the relationship between the activation entropy and the dynamics of the HBN.** This could be done using time-resolved spectroscopy to measure the changes in the HBN structure during the PCET step.
4. **Explore the possibility of using Marcus theory to describe the PCET step in photosynthetic water oxidation.** This could be done by developing a modified version of Marcus theory that takes into account the specific properties of the HBN.
5. **Investigate the role of the HBN in other biological redox reactions.** This could be done by studying the effects of mutations in the HBN on the rate of other redox reactions, such as those involved in respiration and photosynthesis.
