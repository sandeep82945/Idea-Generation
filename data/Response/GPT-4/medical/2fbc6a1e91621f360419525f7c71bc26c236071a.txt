Longitudinal Study on the Impact of Self-care Behaviors on Health Outcomes in AH Patients: Investigate the long-term effects of adopting the recommended self-care behaviors (as measured by the Hippocratic hypertension self-care scale) on cardiovascular health outcomes, disease progression, and quality of life in patients with arterial hypertension. This study would involve following a cohort of patients over time to observe changes in health outcomes related to variations in self-care behaviors.

Comparative Effectiveness of Self-care Interventions: Design a study to compare the effectiveness of different interventions (e.g., educational programs, mobile health applications, support groups) aimed at improving self-care behaviors in patients with AH. Using the Hippocratic hypertension self-care scale, the study could identify which interventions are most effective in enhancing patients' adherence to recommended self-care practices and subsequently lowering blood pressure and reducing cardiovascular risks.

Cross-cultural Validation and Adaptation of the Hippocratic Hypertension Self-care Scale: Given that lifestyle and healthcare practices can vary significantly across different cultures and societies, conducting a study to validate and adapt the Hippocratic hypertension self-care scale for use in diverse cultural contexts would be valuable. This would involve translating the scale, conducting cultural adaptation, and then testing its reliability and validity in different populations.

Exploration of Self-care Behaviors and Comorbidities: Conduct research to explore the relationship between self-care behaviors in AH patients and the presence of comorbid conditions (e.g., diabetes, chronic kidney disease). This study could use the Hippocratic hypertension self-care scale to assess self-care behaviors and examine how comorbidities influence these behaviors and the challenges patients face in managing multiple health conditions.

Development of a Comprehensive Self-care Program Based on Scale Findings: Based on the insights gained from the initial use of the Hippocratic hypertension self-care scale, develop and test a comprehensive self-care program tailored to the specific needs identified through the scale. This program could integrate medication management, dietary guidance, physical activity, and psychological support to enhance overall self-care among AH patients. The effectiveness of this program in improving self-care behaviors and health outcomes would be evaluated through a randomized controlled trial.
