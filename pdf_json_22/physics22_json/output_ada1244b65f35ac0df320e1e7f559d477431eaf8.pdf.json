            "text": "of protein by a magnetic force booster Syou Maki1* & Masayuki Hagiwara2\nWe developed a new type of compact magnetic force booster by which we succeeded in crystallizing proteins (hen egg white lysozyme) while making them levitate in a solution without contacting the container. This technique is noteworthy in the practical merit that we could control the growth of crystals from the initial stage of nucleation in a magnetic field of merely a few Tesla. The shape of the booster was designed in accordance with the dynamical stability against external forces acting on the crystals. Under a stable condition, the crystals condensed spherically, and formed a \u201cshell shaped\u201d crystallization with a hollow interior. Our magnetic force booster has the potential for use in innovation, especially in the field of protein crystal engineering.\nIn the field of structural biology, a three-dimensional arrangement and its configuration of protein molecules are determined by the use of high-intensity X-ray synchrotron radiation. High-quality protein crystals are very desirable, and high-resolution diffraction pattern has brought many informative benefits to analysis in crystallography. In the creation of quality crystals, the crystal growth is expected to be conducted without any mechanical stress. Ideally speaking, protein crystals should be grown as stably levitating in a solution while being free from contact with the container wall. Such a \u201ccontactless\u201d condition is also known as a \u201ccontainerless\u201d condition or a \u201cfree-surface\u201d condition, and many scientists have been attempting to achieve that by means of ultrasonic pressure1\u20135, electrostatic levitation6, two-phase liquids interface7,8, crystallization in a phase-separated droplet9\u201314, and magnetic force15. By the technique of the magneto-Archimedes levitation16, Maki and Ataka crystallized hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) at the solution side of an air\u2013liquid interface17,18. This method achieved a partial contactless condition, and demonstrated that magnetic levitation is of utility even for the engineering of protein crystallization, although we could not reach the final goal of complete \u201ccontactless crystallization\u201d. Around the same time, the National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS) also attempted the contactless protein crystallization by using a magnetic force booster19. They thought that accurate weightlessness would be a breakthrough in crystallization, and they aimed to realize a \u201cuniform\u201d magnetic force field. A \u201cuniform magnetic force field\u201d is a field in which every magnetic force has the same orientation and magnitude, and it is different from a \u201cuniform magnetic field\u201d. The NIMS\u2019s booster had two small pieces made of a ferromagnetic substance and strong support pillars and stage, which are indispensable to hold the booster. Magnetic force near the body of the booster is enhanced owing to its large magnetization and spatial gradient. Kiyoshi et\u00a0al., who were the inventors of the booster used by the NIMS, realized an accurate weightless environment by applying the same magnitude of upward uniform magnetic force as the gravity20,21. However, contactless crystallization was virtually impossible to achieve only by employing the weightless condition of the crystal, and resulted in failure by the growth of many microcrystals on the vessel wall. The reason for that is natural in the solution; even in a zero gravity space, Marangoni convection happens, and the influence of thermal fluctuation, such as Brownian motion, is inevitable.\nIn the present study, we developed new types of magnetic force boosters from various experimental viewpoints. We tested many kinds of uniquely designed boosters, which were made carefully to balance the gravitational force and the levitating force on the crystal nuclei. We noticed through the experiments that \u201cdynamical stability\u201d on the nuclei might be a necessary condition for realizing contactless crystallization. By jointly utilizing the magnetic forces from the booster and a superconducting magnet, we succeeded in the stable crystallization of HEWL protein without contacting the container wall, applying only the magnetic fields of a few Tesla. Here we will describe the details of our contactless crystallization method by the booster and report new findings through in\u00a0situ observation of the crystallization of HEWL protein.\nOPEN\n1Institute of Frontier Science and Technology, Okayama University of Science, 1-1 Ridai-cho, Kitaku, Okayama 700-0005, Japan. 2Center for Advance High Magnetic Field Science (AHMF), Graduate School of Science, Osaka University, 1-1 Machikaneyama-cho, Toyonaka, Osaka 560-0043, Japan. *email: makisyou@ifst.ous.ac.jp\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:17287 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-21727-x"

            "text": "Basic equations. The vector of magnetic flux density B (T) in a superconducting magnet is calculated by the Biot-Savart equation. In this study, the B is decomposed three-dimensionally in the cylindrical coordinate system as B (br, b\u03b8, bz). The vector of the magnetic force F (fr, f\u03b8, fz) is a body force, and is proportional to the product of the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7 (m3/kg), the magnetic flux density, and its gradient. This is presented as the following equation22.\nHere, \u03bc0, \u03c1, and \u2207 are the magnetic permeability of vacuum 4\u03c0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0 10\u22127 (H/m), the density, and a differential operator (nabla), respectively. Along the central axis of the superconducting magnet (z-axis in Fig.\u00a01), the above equation is often approximated as23:\nBalance of force on the crystals. In a conventional superconducting magnet [see (A) in Appendix 1 attached as the Supplementary Material], there are two points nearby the coil edge on the bore axis where the vertical component of the magnetic force is at its maximum. We shall name such points the \u201cmaximum magnetic force point\u201d (MMF point) in this paper. The MMF point can be obtained by the Biot\u2013Savart equation\n(1)F = \u03c7\n\u00b50\n\u03c1 (B \u00b7 \u2207)B.\n(2)F =\n\ufffd\nfr f\u03b8 fz\n\ufffdT\n=\n\n\n0\n0 \u03c7 \u00b50 \u03c1 bz d bz d z\n\n\nT\n.\nA B\nC D\nF\nO\nz\nr\ng\nG\nI\nH\nE\nFigure\u00a01.

The magnetic force magnitude is computed so that fz becomes zero at the MMF point. The blue isothermal distribution corresponds to a weak gravity environment, and the red distribution corresponds to a hypergravity environment. The hourglass-shaped curves near C indicate that the MFz becomes weak, whereas the MFr is maintained.\n3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:17287 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-21727-x\ntheoretically, but in this study, we determined the point based on the measured data provided by the magnet company Japan Superconductor Technology Inc (JASTEC). In the schema of the superconducting magnet in Fig.\u00a01, the positions C and F correspond to the MMF points, which are symmetrically positioned with respect to the magnet coil center, which is the origin, O. We utilized the magneto-Archimedes effect in our crystallization process16. Concretely, gadolinium chloride, which is a paramagnetic substance with large magnetic moments, was adopted as a precipitating agent. By applying magnetic fields, the paramagnetic substance (e.g., the solution) was attracted towards the magnet center, whereas the diamagnetic substance (e.g., HEWL molecules) was repelled by a large magnetic flux density. That is, the external forces acting on the HEWL crystals were assigned into (a) a gravitational force, (b) a buoyancy force from the solution, (c) a magnetic force acting on the crystals, and (d) a repulsive force of the magnetic force acting on the solution. The crystals\u2019 behavior was guided by the balance of the resultant forces among (a) to (d). In this study, we decomposed the forces in the vertical, circumferential, and radial directions in the cylindrical coordinate system, and the driving force vector on the crystals shall be expressed as RF(MFr, MF\u03b8, MFz). In this system, the circumferential component MF\u03b8 becomes zero due to the axisymmetry in a solenoidal magnet. We assume the vertically upward force direction to be positive. The resultant force between (a) and (b) represents the term of buoyancy force, and contributes to the vertical direction only. This will be abbreviated as BF. The resultant force between (c) and (d) is the term of magnetic force, the vertical and radial components of which shall be abbreviated as MFz and MFr, respectively. In the cylindrical coordinate system, RF is summarized as follows.\n\u03c1c, \u03c1s, and g, are the crystal density (kg/m3), solution density (kg/m3), and gravitational acceleration (m/s2), respectively. \u03c7c and \u03c7s are the mass magnetic susceptibilities (m3/kg) of the HEWL crystals and the protein solution, respectively. In this study, \u03c7s is paramagnetic and \u03c7c is diamagnetic. Hence, the sign of the term of \u03c1c\u03c7c \u2212 \u03c1s\u03c7s becomes negative. B2 is calculated as br2 + bz2 since b\u03b8 becomes zero by the axisymmetry of B. The sign of \u2202\u2202r ( B2 )\nis positive where it is within the magnet coil radius. The sign of \u2202\n\u2202z\n( B2 )\nis negative where z > 0, and is positive where z < 0. In summary, the sign of MFr is negative and that of MFz depends on the location. Since the magnitude of \u03c7s is much higher than that of \u03c7c, the repulsive force (d) plays a major role in moving the crystals. In addition, since \u03c1c (1.24 \u00d7 10\u20133\u00a0kg/mL24) is only a bit larger than \u03c1s (experimentally 1.09 \u00d7 10\u20133\u00a0kg/mL in this study), 87.9% of the crystals\u2019 gravity is cancelled in the solution. That is, the magnitude of the term of BF is smaller than that of the gravity.\nAccording to our experiment, the maximum magnitude in the term of 1 2 \u2202 \u2202z\n( B2 ) in Eq.\u00a0(3) was 20.79 T2/m when B was applied 2.12\u00a0T at the origin O. In the same magnetic condition, the magnitude of 1\n2 \u2202 \u2202r\n( B2 )\nwas 3.468 T2/m. In short, MFr was as small as about 16.7% at its maximum compared to MFz. Even at such a weak force, MFr can be tangible as a driving force on the convection and mass transfer phenomena25,26 in weightlessness. Furthermore, MFr is free from the effect of gravity. These characteristics are very favorable for the control over the nuclei. In our experiment, regardless of \u03c7c and \u03c7s unknown, the contactless crystallization was realized without using these properties. This technical procedure is presented in the Appendix 2 attached as the Supplementary Material.\nDynamical stability. In our search for creating contactless crystallization, we aimed to establish a stable condition during the crystal growth process. The schematic illustration in Fig.\u00a01 represents the isothermal distribution of the magnitude of the magnetic force, which was obtained by the computational approach. This approach is described in Appendix 1. Points A to I in this figure are the representative points, and point C is the MMF point.\nAs a first thought experiment, we assumed the case in which the force balance on the crystals is weightless at point C. This case is presented in Fig.\u00a01, where the blue isothermal distribution corresponds to a weak gravity environment and the red distribution corresponds to a hypergravity one. Notice that the strength of the magnetic force and the gravity in Fig.\u00a01 are displayed as dimensionless. We can find an hourglass-shaped distribution near point C. This is attributed to the results that the MFz cancels out the BF at the C, whereas the MFr remains. The hourglass-shaped distribution of the magnetic force was already confirmed visually in a previous study26.\nIn the next thought experiment, the magnitude of MFz is slightly enhanced. Since the magnitude of the upward magnetic force exceeds that of the gravity, the initial weightless condition at the C is changed to the other positions of B or D. In this thought, we assume the cases in which weightlessness is realized at the B. Therefore, the magnitudes of MFz at the A, B, and C are arranged in the following relationship: MFz |A < MFz |B < MFz |C . The force balance between BF and MFz is then deduced as:\nRelation (4) indicates a preferable condition, where a \u201cstable\u201d condition is established in respect to the vertical direction.\nWhen we assume in a third thought experiment that the weightlessness is realized at the position of D, the force magnitude at the C, D, and E are presented as MFz |C > MFz |D > MFz |E . Consequently, the following relationship is deduced as:\n(3)RF =\n\ufffd\nMFr MF\u03b8\nBF +MFz\n\ufffdT\n=\n\n\n\n( \u03c1c \u03c7c\u2212\u03c1s \u03c7s) 2\u00b50 \u2202 \u2202r\n\ufffd B2 \ufffd\n0\n\u2212( \u03c1c \u2212 \u03c1s) g + ( \u03c1c \u03c7c\u2212\u03c1s \u03c7s)\n2\u00b50\n\u2202 \u2202z\n\ufffd B2 \ufffd\n\n\n\nT\n.\n(4)BF +MFz |A < 0, BF +MFz |B = 0, BF +MFz |CF > 0.\n(5)BF +MFz |C > 0, BF +MFz |D = 0, BF +MFz |E < 0.\n4 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:17287 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-21727-x\nRelation (5) represents that a slight unbalance in the force is positively increased there, and the HEWL crystals cannot stay levitated. That is, the force balance is \u201cunstable\u201d. This indicates that the vertically stable condition is limited to only a specific position in the magnet.\nAs regards the radial direction, the bore axis is always \u201cstable\u201d since the MFr becomes zero. In particular, this effect is remarkable in the hourglass-shaped distribution in Fig.\u00a01. For example, the crystals at the I are easily driven to the D according to the relationship on the radial magnetic force of MFr |D < MFr |I . On the other hand, it is impossible for the D to hold the crystals stably because this point is dynamically a \u201csaddle\u201d owing to the vertical force balance in Eq.\u00a0(5). From the viewpoint of mechanical engineering, we will hereafter use the term \u201cdynamic stability\u201d on the contactless crystallization. In short, the crystallization should be carried out \u201cabove the MMF point\u201d and \u201con the bore axis\u201d. The key objective in our technique is how to locally strengthen the MFr without disturbing the influence of MFz. These results are summarized in Table\u00a01."

            "text": "Our designed magnetic force booster. In relation to the previous section, the basic performance required for a new booster is to keep a dynamically stable condition during the crystal growth. Since few examinations of the magnetic force booster have been reported, we conducted many trial tests to find the most appropriate shape and material. All of the trial boosters were designed to be a much smaller size than that of the prototype booster6. In our test, we succeeded in realizing contactless crystallization with two types of boosters. Figure\u00a02 shows the schematic illustrations and actual photos of our boosters. In this paper, Fig.\u00a0 2A shall be named \u201ctype A\u201d and Fig.\u00a02B \u201ctype B\u201d. Both boosters are made of stainless steel (ISO X6Cr17 (AISI-430 alloy)) and are 20\u00a0mm in diameter. The \u201ctype A\u201d is fixed by holding the brimmed flange. The \u201ctype B\u201d is fixed by sandwiching the inner bottom with a circular plate of non-magnetic material. A thin cylindrical wall (0.1\u00a0mm thickness), which both types have in common, is essentially important to locally strengthen the MFr. The results from using the type B booster are presented in detail in this paper. Figure\u00a02C is the overall photo, including the booster and a nonmagnetic support table. The booster was put on the table, as shown by the broken line. Figure\u00a02D is a closeup photo of the type B booster arranged on the table.\nAs presented in the drawings of Fig.\u00a02, the volumes of the type A and B boosters are estimated as 182 and 185\u00a0 mm3, respectively. The prototype booster developed at NIMS, in contrast, was made up of two parts; one was a disk-shaped object (22\u00a0mm diameter and 10\u00a0mm height), and the other was a cylindrical object (40\u00a0mm outer diameter, 20\u00a0mm inner diameter, and 10\u00a0mm height), and the volume was 13,226\u00a0 mm3 in total. Our miniaturized boosters are devoted to simplifying the observation systems, and are therefore versatile for saving a lot of time and effort in exchanging samples. It can be safely sustained in a magnetic field even with small supports.\nCrystallization and the booster setting. The crystals were adjusted by the batch method. The final concentrations of the HEWL (MP Biomedicals, Inc.), hydrochloric acid (Wako Co. Ltd), and the gadolinium chloride hexahydrate (Wako Co. Ltd) were 6.44\u00a0wt%, 0.00535\u00a0mol/kg, and 0.388\u00a0mol/kg, respectively. We dissolved them in water in that order, then this protein solution was poured into a glass vessel and installed in a superconducting magnet (JMTD-6T100EF3, JASTEC), where the type B booster was installed in advance. The center part of the solution was accorded to a place about 3\u00a0mm above the MMF point. The booster\u2019s upper edge was set at 25\u00a0mm below the MMF point. The magnetic flux density at the origin O (the center of the coil) was set at 2.12\u00a0T. This was equivalent to 1.75\u00a0T at the buster position, and we could find that the booster was magnetized. The temperature in the bore was kept constant at 17 \u00b1 0.2\u00a0\u00b0C, and was measured at 2\u00a0min intervals by means of a data logger (NR-1000, Keyence Co. Ltd.) and several thermocouples (T type, Anbe SMT Co. Ltd.). The crystallization process was recorded from the side by using a rigid scope (Industrial Rigid Scope Type 5, Olympus Co. Ltd.) and a CCD camera (OH414, Olympus Co. Ltd.).\nMagnetic saturation of the booster. When using a magnetic force booster made of iron, we must consider the magnetic saturation of the booster. In our experiment, the booster was magnetically saturated, since a magnetic field of 2\u00a0T or more was applied. This suggests that the magnetic force by the booster had reached\nTable 1. The summary of the force balance between the buoyancy force (BF) and vertical component of the magnetic force (MFz). We assume the vertically upward force is positive and the point C is the MMF point. So the relationships of BF < 0, MFz > 0, MFz |A < MFz |B < MFz |C , and MFz |E < MFz |D < MFz |C are regarded.\nPoints in Fig.\u00a01 When BF + MFz is zero at the point B When BF + MFz is zero at the point C When BF + MFz is zero at the point D\nA BF +MFz |A < 0 , crystals move downward BF +MFz |A < 0 , crystals move downward\nB BF +MFz |B = 0 , crystals are in the weightlessness, and they can keep stable levitation (dynamically stable) BF +MFz |B < 0 , crystals move downward\nC (MMF point) BF +MFz |C > 0 , crystals move upward BF +MFz |C = 0 , crystals are in the weightlessness, but they cannot keep stable levitation simply by the condition at C BF +MFz |C > 0 , crystals move upward\nD BF +MFz |D < 0 , crystals move downward BF +MFz |D = 0 , crystals are in the weightlessness, but they cannot keep stable levitation (dynamically unstable)\nE BF +MFz |E < 0 , crystals move downward BF +MFz |E < 0 , crystals move downward\n5 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:17287 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-21727-x\nalmost constant magnitude. We know the radial component of the magnetic force by the superconducting magnet becomes almost zero near the MMF point. This means that the driving force on the crystals can be controlled simply by the vertical component of the magnetic force by the superconducting magnet. That simple control over the crystals is very helpful for the reproducibility of the crystallization."

            "text": "We demonstrated that the contactless crystallization is possible by using our magnetic force booster. We also found it essentially important to configure strict and careful adjustments if we need to make the nuclei crystallize into a shell shape. Here we will discuss the spherical shell-shaped structure by using the schematic illustrations in Fig.\u00a06. As a prior assumption, the dynamical stability on the crystal growth must be stable, and the center of the spherical crystal is determined as the point N. As shown in Fig.\u00a06, schema (A) and (B) indicate the initial aggregation and the well-grown state of the nuclei, respectively. When the nuclei generate in region (a) far away from the N, they are strongly attracted by the RF, as shown by the orange arrows in schema (A). Since the MFr acts axisymmetrically and the vertical driving force MFz + BF is also almost symmetric with respect to the N, fine crystals are driven to form in a quasi-spherical symmetry. A similar spherical polymer has been realized by the magnetic levitation technique27.\nAs the crystals get close to the N, the external forces on the crystals become smaller and smaller, and finally the crystals are forced to stay near the N. In the succession of the concentration of other crystals, some crystals come into contact with the periphery crystals and grow large together, resulting in the shaping of a spherical shell structure. Since the periphery part is constantly supplied with high-concentration protein molecules, the shell structure grows thick, as schematically shown in region (b). In contrast, the mass transfer effect is suppressed in the hollow part of region (c). The crystal growth becomes weak, and it is insufficient to fill up the hollow part with crystals. As a consequence, the crystals build a two-layer structure, i.e., a spherical shell outside and a hollow inside. If there were even a small disturbance in the crystals contacting each other, the spherical shell structure would probably be lost.

In another case, Appendix 4 shows white precipitates aggregated spherically. Both crystallization conditions are the same as those in Fig.\u00a03.\nAs regards the effect of gadolinium on the crystallization, it is unclear whether the presence of gadolinium atoms affects the crystal structure. We have confirmed that magnetic levitation is feasible even with nickel chloride and manganese chloride, and the use of a magnetic substance other than gadolinium has hardly any effect on changing the morphology of HEWL crystals. We are currently conducting research on the thermal properties of protein crystals28, and we suspect that magnetic substances might affect the thermophysical characteristics of the crystals. Further study is in progress.\nIn summary, our present opinion is that, even if a delicate experimental process is required, we would like to emphasize the merit of the magnetic force booster, which is the only way we know of to actually realize the contactless crystallization of protein. Further improvement of the booster and crystalline is in progress."
