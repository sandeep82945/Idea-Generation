    "abstractText": "Beta-delayed neutron emission and \u03b2-delayed fission (\u03b2df) probabilities were calculated for heavy, neutron-rich nuclei using the Los Alamos coupled Quasi-Particle Random Phase Approximation plus Hauser-Feshbach (QRPA+HF) approach. In this model, the compound nucleus is initially populated by \u03b2-decay and is followed through subsequent statistical decays taking into account competition between neutrons, \u03b3-rays and fission. The primary output of these calculations includes branching ratios along with neutron and \u03b3-ray spectra. We find a relatively large region of heavy nuclides where the probability of \u03b2df is near 100%. For a subset of nuclei near the neutron dripline, delayed neutron emission and the probability to fission are both large which leads to the possibility of multichance \u03b2df (mc-\u03b2df). We comment on prospective neutron-rich nuclei that could be probed by future experimental campaigns and provide a full table of branching ratios in ASCII format in the supplemental material for use in various applications.",

M. Sprouse1\n1Theoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545, USA (Dated: January 14, 2022)\nBeta-delayed neutron emission and \u03b2-delayed fission (\u03b2df) probabilities were calculated for heavy, neutron-rich nuclei using the Los Alamos coupled Quasi-Particle Random Phase Approximation plus Hauser-Feshbach (QRPA+HF) approach. In this model, the compound nucleus is initially populated by \u03b2-decay and is followed through subsequent statistical decays taking into account competition between neutrons, \u03b3-rays and fission. The primary output of these calculations includes branching ratios along with neutron and \u03b3-ray spectra. We find a relatively large region of heavy nuclides where the probability of \u03b2df is near 100%. For a subset of nuclei near the neutron dripline, delayed neutron emission and the probability to fission are both large which leads to the possibility of multichance \u03b2df (mc-\u03b2df). We comment on prospective neutron-rich nuclei that could be probed by future experimental campaigns and provide a full table of branching ratios in ASCII format in the supplemental material for use in various applications.\nPACS numbers:\nI. INTRODUCTION\nBeta-delayed fission (\u03b2df) is a two step nuclear decay process in which fission follows electron capture (EC), \u03b2+ decay or \u03b2\u2212 decay. Discovered by experiments in the 1960\u2019s, this process starts with a parent nucleus which undergoes EC or \u03b2+/\u2212 decay to an excited state in the daughter nucleus. The populated state may fission if the excitation energy is near or greater than the fission barrier of the daughter nucleus and is in competition with particle emission and \u03b3 de-excitation. This rare decay mode in near-stable isotopes is limited by the relatively small \u03b2-decay Q-value of the parent nucleus making it a unique probe of low energy structure of atomic nuclei. In nuclei with extreme neutron-excess this decay mode may be more prevalent, playing a role in the cosmos by influencing the formation of the elements found on the periodic table in astrophysical events [1].\nDifficulty in the production of exotic nuclei which may undergo fission coupled with small branching ratios relative to other processes (such as \u03b1-decay) makes the investigation of \u03b2df very challenging in a laboratory environment [2]. Just under thirty cases of \u03b2df on both the neutron-deficient and neutron-rich side of stability have been studied experimentally with most of this progress coming in recent years at radioactive beam facilities. The bulk of current data resides on the neutron-deficient side of stability, e.g. most recently the two isotopes of thallium (Z = 81), 178Tl and 180Tl have been shown to be the lighest measured \u03b2df precursors [3\u20135]. While the \u03b2df branching ratio of the neutron-deficient isotope 242Es at\n\u2217Electronic address: mumpower@lanl.gov; https://www. matthewmumpower.com\n0.6(2) \u00d7 10\u22122 remains one of the largest measured to date, see Table 1 of Ref. [2] for full list. The partial \u03b2df half-lives of neutron-deficient nuclei have been found to follow a systematic trend [6], however further measurements are required to determine if the systematics can be extended to neutron-rich nuclei. Measurements have been made on only six neutron-rich nuclei, all of which exhibit extremely small branchings relative to measurements of neutron-deficient nuclei. The reason for this observation comes from the fact that experiments cannot yet reach nuclei where the fission barrier height (Bf) is sufficiently smaller than Q\u03b2\u2212 . Such low branching ratios are beyond the fidelity of any current nuclear model prediction.\nExcluding the paucity of experimental data, the description of \u03b2df persists as an open challenge to theory. This stems from the requirement of an all encompassing description of the complexity of the atomic nucleus. To list a few examples: the \u03b2-strength function, excited states, single particle and collective effects as well as a fission properties that depend on the nuclear potentialenergy landscape, and traversal through it (resulting in the production of fission fragments) must all be modeled. Of particular interest to the description of \u03b2df are those neutron-rich nuclei that may participate in the astrophysical rapid neutron capture or r-process of nucleosynthesis [7]. While these nuclei remain out of reach to experimental facilities, heavy r-process nuclei have relatively large Q\u03b2\u2212 compared to Bf which is a favorable condition for large \u03b2df branching ratios. The work of Thielemann et al. [8] laid the groundwork for the theoretical description of \u03b2df and its application to the rapid neutron capture or r process of nucleosynthesis. Statistical approaches, as studied here, offer further exploration of delayed fission phenomenon [9, 10].\nIn this work, we study the \u03b2df of neutron-rich\nar X\niv :2\n20 1.\n02 88\n9v 1\n[ nu\ncl -t\nh] 8\nJ an\n2 02\n2\n2 nuclei using the recently developed Quasi-particle Random Phase Approximation plus Hauser-Feshbach (QRPA+HF) framework. This microscopic approach starts with a compound nucleus initially populated by \u03b2-decay and follows the subsequent statistical decay taking into account competition between neutrons, \u03b3-rays and fission. We find a relatively large region of the chart of nuclides where the probability of \u03b2df is near 100% that prevents the production of superheavy elements in nature [9]. The decay chains of very neutron-rich nuclei near the neutron dripline exhibit large neutron multiplicity and large probability to fission leading to the possibility of multi-chance \u03b2df or mc-\u03b2df for short. This decay mode results in multiple fission chances after \u03b2-decay analogous to multi-chance neutron induced fission. We discuss the theoretical basis of our model and provide tabulated values in the supplemental material."

            "text": "The Quasi-particle Random Phase Approximation plus Hauser-Feshbach (QRPA+HF) approach was introduced in Refs. [11, 12] using version 3.3.3 of the Los Alamos Hauser-Feshbach statisitical decay code. Here, we apply this framework to the calculation of delayed-neutron emission in the presence of \u03b2-delayed fission and now use version 3.5.0. Among other modifications, the change in version number represents the modifications to the code to include the description of fission during the statistical decay. The calculation of \u03b2df in this approach is a two step process starting with the \u03b2-decay of the precursor nucleus (Z,A) where Z represents the atomic number, and A is the total number of nucleons, followed by the statistical decay of the subsequent daughter generations, (Z + 1,A \u2212 j) where j is the number of neutrons emitted, ranging from 0 to 10. Ground state properties are taken from the 2012 version of the Finite Range Droplet Model [13] unless otherwise noted. The procedure for the QRPA+HF calculation is shown schematically in Fig 1 and outlined in detail below.\nThe \u03b2-decay of the precursor nucleus provides the initial population of the daughter nucleus (Z + 1,A), and is given by the QRPA formalism of Refs. [14\u201317]. QRPA allows for the calculation of excited state properties by using a small perturbing force. We use the latest QRPA calculations from Ref. [18] which provides both the GamowTeller (GT) and First-Forbidden (FF) contributions, a notable upgrade in this work compared to our existing global model calculations [9, 12]. In this framework, based on a folded-Yukawa interaction, the \u03b2-decay halflife is calculated via\n1\nT1/2 = \u2211 0\u2264Ex\u2264Q\u03b2 S\u03b2(Ex)f(Z,Q\u03b2 \u2212 Ex) , (1)\nwhere S\u03b2(Ex) is the \u03b2-strength function at excitation energy Ex in the daughter nucleus and f is the Fermi\nfunction which takes into account the phase space contribution. The energy factor can be approximated as f \u223c (Q\u03b2\u2212Ex)5 so that the low-energy excitations or near ground-state transitions dominate the calculation of the half-life. Thus, the output of the QRPA (the \u03b2-strength function) at low energies is of critical importance to understanding this phenomenon [19]. Where data exists, we may supplement the theoretical calculation with the experimental data as in Ref. [12], however, we note that in the case of neutron-rich nuclei which undergo \u03b2df there is no data with which to compare or include.\nThe QRPA solutions for \u03b2-decay strongly depend on the level structure in the participating nuclei. Further, these solutions are strongly peaked depending on the unknown level structure for the nuclei of interest. We therefore apply a smoothing procedure to the \u03b2-strength distribution by a Gaussian,\n\u03c9(Ex) = C \u2211 k b(k) 1\u221a 2\u03c0\u0393 exp { \u2212 [E (k) \u2212 Ex]2 2\u03932 } , (2)\nwhere b(k) are the branching ratios from the parent state to the daughter states E(k), Ex is the excitation energy of the daughter nucleus, C is a normalization constant, and the Gaussian width is taken to scale proportional to A\u22120.57 for excitations above 2 MeV, as used in Ref. [16, 17]. The choice in this work results in a spreading of roughly 200 keV for A = 200 nuclei, and is roughly equal to the error in the mass model. Other Gaussian widths have been used in our previous works, for instance a constant value of \u0393 = 100 keV in Refs. [11, 12]. The choice of the Gaussian width represents an intrinsic uncertainty associated with modern QRPA methods.\nWith the population of the first daughter nucleus defined by the \u03b2-strength function from the QRPA calculation, the statistical decay can then be followed where the competition between neutron emission, \u03b3-rays and fission occurs. In this second stage of the calculation, the daughter nucleus is assumed to be in a compound state, which means the nucleus is governed by its overall properties rather than the details of the formation process [20]. This assumption leads to the independent factorization of exit channel probabilities; for our purposes it is a good approximation. Independent factorization of exit channel probabilities may be modified in certain situations by taking into account the memory of the entrance channel via correction factors [21].\nThe excited state transitions show in Fig. 1 can be discrete or in the continuum. Since there is no known level data for the extremely neutron-rich nuclei studied here, we rely on the Gilbert-Cameron level density [22]. This level density formula connects a Fermi gas model to a constant temperature model at a matching energy with parameters taken from systematics at stability [23]. Shell corrections are applied to the level density using the common Ignatyuk et al. prescription [24].\nTo easily reference the compound nucleus in the context of \u03b2-delayed calculations, we define the compound\nstate as c (j) k where c (j) represents the j-th compound nucleus after j neutron emissions and k the index of the excited state in the same nucleus. Using this shorthand, c(0) is the daughter nucleus (Z + 1,A), c(1) is the granddaughter nucleus (Z + 1,A\u2212 1) and so on.\nThe transmission coefficient for \u03b3 de-excitation in the compound nucleus, c(j), is denoted by vertical dashed lines in Fig. 1. This quantity is calculated using the definition,\nT (j)\u03b3 (E\u03b3) = 2\u03c0E (2L+1) \u03b3 f (j) XL(E\u03b3) , (3)\nwhere the transition occurs with \u03b3-ray energy E\u03b3 = Ei \u2212 Ek, and f (j)XL is the \u03b3-ray strength function of multipole type XL for compound nucleus c(j). The \u03b3-ray transmission coefficient is often written TXL as shorthand for the multipolarities (E1, M2, E2, M2, etc.). In this work, we use the generalized Lorentzian for the E1 \u03b3-strength function (\u03b3SF) [25]. Additional low energy enhancements, such as the M1 scissors mode [26, 27] are not considered here.\nThe transmission coefficient for neutron emission between two compound states is represented by diagonal solid lines connecting adjacent compound nuclei in Fig. 1. The calculation of this quantity occurs between two excited states Ei and Ek\u2032 in neighboring nuclei and can be\nwritten down as T (j+1)n (Ei, Ek\u2032) = \u2211 s \u2211 l Tnls (Ei \u2212 S (j) n \u2212 Ek\u2032) , (4)\nwhere S (j) n is the one neutron separation energy of c(j) and the summation is over all possible partial waves. The difference in energy En = Ei \u2212 Ek\u2032 is the energy of the delayed neutron. The Tnls values are given using the Koning-Delaroche global optical potential that is optimized for neutron-rich nuclei [28\u201330]. The prime on the second (k) index is a reminder that the energy level is in a different compound nucleus.\nThe transmission coefficient for fission is approximated using the Hill-Wheeler formula assuming transmission through a parabolic barrier [31],\nT (j) f (E) =\n1.0\n1.0 + exp(2\u03c0Bf\u2212EC ) , (5)\nwhere Bf is the fission barrier height, C is the curvature and E is the relative excitation energy of the j-th compound nucleus. The fission transmission coefficient is represented as a horizontal solid line to the right of each compound nucleus in Fig. 1. Fission curvatures are defined separately for even-even, odd-A and odd-odd nuclei as in Ref. [8]. The effective transmission coefficient\n4 for fission depends on the number of fission barriers. For instance, with two barriers,\nT efff = TATB TA + TB , (6)\nwhere TA and TB are the first and second fission transmission coefficients respectively. We have considered calculations with a second barrier that is wider and shorter than the first and note that it does not qualitatively change our results. Therefore, in the remainder of this work, we only consider the case of a single (maximal) barrier, T (j) f = TA. Note that for all of the transmission equations above, we have quoted for convinence the \u2018lumped\u2019 versions which remove the spin and parity dependence [27].\nWe use the Finite-Range Liquid-Drop Model (FRLDM barrier height predictions from Ref. [32] for our primary results. Later in section IV we study the variation of our predictions based on different barrier heights. The FRLDM barrier height predictions have been extensively benchmarked against many nuclear observables including electron-capture delayed fission data, fission-fragment charge yields and a handful of prompt neutron-capture data from weapons tests. The predictions of ground state masses relative to these barrier heights shows that there are prominent regions of both (n,f) and \u03b2df for the heavy neutron-rich nuclei near the end of the chart of nuclides with \u03b2df most influential just beyond the N = 184 closed shell towards the neutron dripline [32].\nWith the transmission coefficients defined, we can calculate transmission probabilities for these three channels. In what follows we simplify the equations by excluding indices of quantum numbers and implicitly take all transitions to obey spin-parity selection rules which changes our transmission coefficients into the so-called \u2018lumped\u2019 versions. The \u03b3-emission transition probability in the j-th compound nucleus is taken to be\npj(Ei, Ek) = 1\nNj(Ei) T (j)\u03b3 (Ei \u2212 Ek)\u03c1j(Ek) (7)\nwhere the transition is from a level with high excitation energy Ei to a level of energy Ek, T (j) \u03b3 is the \u03b3-ray transmission coefficient for c(j), \u03c1j(Ek) is the level density in c(j) at energy Ek and Nj(Ei) is a normalization factor that we define shortly. The neutron-emission transition probability from c(j) to c(j+1) is defined as\nqj(Ei, Ek\u2032) = 1\nNj(Ei) T (j+1)n (Ei, Ek\u2032)\u03c1j+1(Ek\u2032) (8)\nwhere the transition is from an energy level Ei in c (j) to an energy level Ek\u2032 in c (j+1), T (j+1) n is the neutron transmission coefficient from c(j+1) to c(j) and \u03c1j+1(Ek\u2032) is the level density in c(j+1) evaluated at Ek\u2032 . For fission, the transmission probability from an excitation energy Ei below the fission barrier for compound nucleus c (j) is\ncalculated as\nrj(Ei) = 1\nNj(Ei) T\n(j) f (Ei)\u03c1 f j (Ei) , (9)\nwhere T (j) f (Ei) is the fission transmission coefficient from Eqn. (5) and \u03c1fj (Ei) is the fission level density in c (j). The normalization factor, Nj is given by the sum over all possible exit channels\nNj(Ei) = \u222b Ei 0 T (j)\u03b3 (Ei \u2212 Ek)\u03c1j(Ek)dEk\n+ \u222b Ei\u2212S(j)n 0 T (j+1)n (Ei, Ek\u2032)\u03c1j+1(Ek\u2032)dEk\u2032\n+ \u222b Ei 0 T (j) f (Ek)\u03c1j(Ek)dEk , (10)\nwhere the integration in each case runs over the appropriate energy window. The units of the q, p and r quantities are the same as the level density and the transition probabilities do not depend on how the initial state, Ei was populated due to the Bohr independence hypothesis of compound nucleus formation.\nThe level population in the compound nucleus, c(j+1), at energy, Ek, is\nPj+1(Ek) = \u2211 i Pj+1(Ei)pj+1(Ei, Ek)\n+ \u2211 k\u2032 Pj(Ek\u2032)qj(Ek\u2032 , Ek)\n+ \u2211 i Pj+1(Ei)rj+1(Ei) , (11)\nwith the summation running over over all levels which may feed the compound state c (j+1) k . Each of the terms takes into account the possible pathways of \u03b3-ray emission, neutron emission and fission to the excited state Ek. The initial population of this recursive function comes from the \u03b2-decay strength function.\nFollowing from Eqn. (11), the total production probability (total branching ratio) to emit j-neutrons or for the j-th compound nucleus to fission are given by,\nPjn = Pj(Ek = Egs) where rj = 0 (12a) Pjf = \u2211 k Pj(Ek) where rj 6= 0. (12b)\nThus, for \u03b2-delayed neutron emission, we merely need to calculate the production of the ground state, Egs for each compound system, c(j). Conversely, for fission, we must sum over all the excited states that end with fission in the particular compound system.\nEquations 12a and 12b tell us that the statistical decay must end in either the population of one of the daughter generation\u2019s ground state or by fission. Ergo, the cumulative probability to emit either neutrons or fission must\n5 sum to unity\n1 = 10\u2211 j=0 Pjn + 10\u2211 j=0 Pjf = Pn + Pf (13)\nwhere the summation index, j, represents the number of neutrons emitted and runs over all possible daughter nuclei. The value of Pjn is the probability to emit j-neutrons without fissioning and Pjf is the probability to fission after j-neutrons have been emitted. For very neutron-rich heavy nuclei that may participate in the r process, we designate a maximum value of j = 10. The cumulative sum of these two quantities are denoted by Pn and Pf respectively. Some values of Pjn or Pjf may be zero due to selection rules or an exhaustion of the initial excitation energy. We explicitly assume that other channels such as proton or alpha emission are very small.\nIn the context of the approach outlined above, regular or first-chance \u03b2df is defined as the fission that occurs during the population of the first compound nucleus formation after \u03b2-decay. Explicitly, if (Z,A) is the precursor nucleus that \u03b2-decays, fission occurring in the first generation daughter nucleus, (Z+1,A), is first-chance \u03b2df. For heavy neutron-rich nuclei there are additional chances to fission after \u03b2-decay stemming from the fact that these nuclei have relatively large Q\u03b2 values as compared to the fission barriers, Bf, or neutron separation energies, Sn. Thus, neutron-rich nuclei populated in extreme astrophysical conditions may open the possibility for each of the populated daughter generations to fission after \u03b2decay. We use the term multi-chance \u03b2-delayed fission (mc-\u03b2df for short) to describe this phenomenon, which is analogous to multi-chance neutron-induced fission that arises at high neutron incident energies. In Fig. 1 this decay mode is represented by fission occuring in the second, or higher, daughter generations. If the sum of the fission probabilities after the first daughter generation is greater than 10 %,\n\u2211 j>0 Pjf > 10%, then we consider this\nnucleus to undergo mc-\u03b2df. Lastly, it is useful in analysis to compute the average neutron multiplicity obtained after \u03b2-decay but prescission,\n\u3008n\u3009 = 10\u2211 j=0 j ( Pjn + Pjf ) (14)\nwhere the summation index again represents the number of neutrons emitted and Pjn, Pjf are defined in Eqns. (12)."

            "text": "Our results include \u03b2-delayed neutron emission and \u03b2-delayed fission probabilities for all neutron-rich nuclei from stability to extreme neutron excess with an upper limit of the mass number at A = 330 which represents\nthe extent of the FRDM2012 model. We first discuss individual cases before going into the global results of applying the QRPA+HF framework to all nuclei.\nAs a typical example, we first explore the \u03b2df of rprocess nucleus 28297Bk. This nucleus has Q\u03b2 \u223c 11 MeV resulting in a population of high-lying excited states in subsequent daughter generations. A competition ensues between the neutron, \u03b3-ray and fission channels during the statistical decay as shown in Fig. 2. In each successive panel going from bottom to top, the energies are shifted relative to the ground state of the first daughter nucleus. For reference, the first daughter generation 282 98Cf has Sn = 3.33 MeV and Bf = 3.82 MeV while the second and third generations have Sn = 2.36 MeV, Bf = 4.47 MeV and Sn = 3.65 MeV, Bf = 4.54 MeV respectively. The neutron multiplicity is \u3008n\u3009 = 1.07 for this decay chain with large fission chances above j = 0, thereby satisfying the definition of a nucleus which undergoes mc-\u03b2df.\nFission dominates the low lying excitations in the first daughter (j = 0; bottom panel). Generally one would expect the \u03b3-channel to have the largest transmission well below the barrier, however, in some cases such as this one, the channel may be blocked due to selection rules.\n6 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Neutrons emitted after -decay (j) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Pr ob ab ilit y [% ] 290Am Pjf 290Am Pjn 295Fm Pjf 295Fm Pjn\nFIG. 3: (Color Online) Individual probabilities for delayed neutron and delayed fission as a function of j neutron emitted from the daughter nucleus. 295Fm is dominated by fission while 290Am shows more competition between neutron emission and fission.\nNevertheless, the total transmission coefficient (right Yaxis) is very small in this energy regime so neither channel contributes to the resultant probabilities. Above the neutron separation energy neutron emission is energetically possible, cutting the fission transmission in half since the barrier height is on the order of the separation energy in this nucleus. We find that the fission transmission coefficient again increases above the neutron transmission coefficient after about 4 MeV due to the higher fission level density relative to the ground state level density.\nIn the second daughter (j = 1; middle panel), the \u03b3 transmission coefficient contributes the most to the low excitation energy regime. After crossing the neutron separation energy neutrons immediately activates with fission transmission slowly increasing. One of the main reasons for the difference between this nucleus and the previous is that the barrier heigh in this nucleus is several MeV higher than the separation energy resulting in a slower onset of fission taking over. The third nucleus in the decay chain shows a similar behavior as the first.\nFigure 2 hints at a subtle interplay between the \u03b2strength function, mass surface and fission barrier heights in predicting \u03b2df properties. To explore these relationships further we highlight the \u03b2df of 295Fm and 290Am.\nFigure 3 shows the individual Pjn and Pjf probabilities after successive neutrons are emitted along the decay chain. In the case of \u03b2df of 295Fm, fission in the first and second daughter generations completely govern the decay. The reason for this is that in the first daughter 295101Md has Sn = 3.15 MeV while Bf = 2.69 MeV, thus fission operates at low excitation energy and neutron emission is strongly hampered, only reaching a maximum ratio of 25% of the total transmission right near the threshold energy. The same scenario plays out in the second daughter, thus limiting a longer decay chain with\nCu m\nul at\niv e\npr ob\nab ilit\nie s [\n% ]\nAv er\nag e\nne ut\nro n\nm ul\ntip lic\nity ,\nn\n160 170 180 190 200 210 220 230 0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n(a)\nPf Pn n\n160 170 180 190 200 210 220 230 Neutron number, N\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n(b)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8 Z=94\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8 Z=97\nFIG. 4: (Color Online) (a) The cumulative probabilities for emitting neutrons (blue) or fission (red) after \u03b2-decay for neutron-rich plutonium (Z = 94) isotopes. The summation of these two terms yields 100%. The average neutron multiplicity after \u03b2-decay, \u3008n\u3009, is also displayed by a dashed line and read from the right Y-axis. (b) The same quantities shown for the berkelium (Z = 97) isotopic chain. Solid grey vertical line indicates the one-neutron dripline in FRDM2012.\nj > 1. Conversely, in the \u03b2df of 290Am, we see from Fig. 3 that a longer decay chain (up to j = 4) ensues with significant probabilities for both neutron emission and fission. Here the separation energies of the daughter generations are all consistently lower than the respective barrier heights, thus providing ample competition between the neutron and fission channels throughout each isotope participating in the statistical decay.\nBoth the cumulative probability to emit a neutron and to fission along an isotopic chain tend to oscillate as shown in Fig. 4 for neutron-rich isotopes of plutonium (a) and berkelium (b). The overall trend of the cumulative probabilities is dependent on the fission barrier heights of the nuclei involved in the decay. The cumulative \u03b2df probability is small near stability since fission barriers are relatively large here, in agreement with experiments. Where fission barriers are relatively low, e.g. near N = 180 for plutonium and N = 190 for berkelium, \u03b2df probabilities may reach near 100%. The odd-even staggering seen in the cumulative curves is sensitive to nuclear masses because the difference in nuclear masses sets the threshold energy for neutron emission. Starting\n7 from stability, the first nucleus in the isotopic chain to have Sn < 0 is denoted by the solid grey line in both panels. This line denotes the extent of the neutron dripline in FRDM2012 that may be accessible in astrophysical applications.\nThe average neutron multiplicity before scission, \u3008n\u3009, is shown on the right Y-axis for the same set of isotopes. The increasing value of this quantity with neutron excess shows that mc-\u03b2df occupies a substantial amount of real estate after the N = 184 shell closure. Additional neutrons may emitted during scission which we have not considered here that will provide more late-time neutrons for capture in the astrophysical r process [33].\nWe now focus our discussion on the global results shown in Fig. 5. The r-process highway, nuclei with Sn \u223c 1 to 2 MeV, is denoted by black dots to guide the eye. This neutron-rich pathway may extend into the region of large neutron emission as shown in panel (a). Towards the neutron dripline roughly five to six neutrons are emitted on average during the decay, similar to other model predictions in the literature [34]. The average neutron energy after \u03b2-decay is plotted in panel (b). Neutron energy for these heavy nuclei is smaller for nuclei that exhibit mc-\u03b2df as compared to those surrounding nuclei resulting in a faster thermalization timescale in the context of nucleosynthesis.\nSeveral additional features of importance for the r process are shown in panel (c) which highlights the cumulative probability for \u03b2df. Beyond the N = 184 shell closure, many nuclei have Pjf = 100%. This means that the \u03b2-decay chain always ends in fission rather than the population of the ground state of any of the daughter generations. When this occurs, the nuclear flow of the r process can no longer increase in proton number preventing the production of superheavy elements. Nuclear flow may proceed at the dripline, subject to mc-\u03b2df, but network simulations show a termination point around A \u223c 300 [9]. We find this region to extend further than previous calculations [8] suggesting that a neutron-rich pathway to populate superheavies via \u03b1-decay is unlikely [35, 36]. Multi-chance \u03b2df, outlined by the solid black boundary in Fig. 5, that occurs towards the neutron dripline is another feature of interest for r-process nucleosynthesis. These nuclei have large Q\u03b2 and large neutron multiplicity after \u03b2-decay due to small separation energies. Unique to this decay process is the observation that the production of light fission products come from a superposition of the yield distributions of the heavy daughter nuclei. Details of the impact of first-chance and multi-chance \u03b2df on r-process abundances can be found in Ref. [9]."

            "heading": "IV. NUCLEI OF INTEREST CLOSE TO STABILITY",
            "text": "The bulk of the discussion has been centered around nuclei with extreme neutron excess. We now turn to the possibility of future experimental measurements probing\nneutron-rich \u03b2df branching ratios for actinides and superheavies. We remind the reader that closer to stability model calculations are more susceptible to deviations, for example from the \u03b2-strength function, than at high neutron excess as has been pointed out in previous work [17].\nTo isolate potentially interesting nuclei, and reduce dependence on any single model, we account for several variations in our inputs. We probe the differences that arise in the \u03b2-strength from three models reported in our previous work [16, 17, 37]. We additionally account for variation in the nuclear mass surface by using various models: the 2012 FRDM [38], Duflo-Zuker [39], Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB-27) [40], UNEDF1 [41], Wood-Saxon [42] and KTUY05 [43]. Finally, we also consider variation in the estimated fission barrier heights of the models FRLDM [32], ETFSI [44], HFB-14 [45] and KTUY [46]. This totals 72 model variations in which we can probe the differences in predicted \u03b2-delayed neutron and \u03b2df probabilities. We note that many more additional model variations were performed using other mass models and those results are consistent with and do not alter the conclusions presented below.\nFigure 6 shows the resultant model variations for nuclei near stability with the extent of NuBase (2020) in the region shown for reference [48]. The colorbar of this figure indicates the percentage of models that predict greater than one percent \u03b2df probability for the given species. Near measured nuclei there is little predicted \u03b2df branching. However, with increasing neutron excess there is substantial agreement among the models that neutron-rich nuclei undergo at least some \u03b2df.\nFrom these model variations we form a subset (indicated by the space between NuBase (2020) and the black solid line in Fig. 6) that may be accessible in future experimental undertakings. Our criterion for future accessibility is: (1) neutron-rich nuclei with 90 \u2264 Z \u2264 120 (2) Pf \u2265 1% and (3) no more than 5 neutrons away from the last neutron-rich value in NuBase (2020). This criterion produces a set of 35 nuclei close to stability which are predicted to be most likely to have a measurable \u03b2delayed fission branching. We summarize this information in Table I. The percent models (column 5) in the table represents the number of variations out of 72 total with Pf \u2265 1%. The minimum fission probability, Pminf (column 6), represents the smallest Pf value among the subset of models with Pf \u2265 1% and likewise for the maximum fission probability, Pmaxf (column 7).\nSeveral nuclei in this list are only a few neutrons from the last neutron-rich isotope found in the recent evaluated data of NuBase (2020). A straightforward way to assess the top experimental candidates is to multiply the percentage of models in agreement of \u03b2df with the minimum \u03b2df probability, Pminf . This information can be found in columns 5 and 6 of Table I. From this estimate one finds primarily superheavies with 282Bh (Z = 107) topping the list, but such nuclei may be rather hard to measure owing to low production. In the actinide region, the odd-Z isotopic chains are of interest with Am\n9\nTABLE I: Nuclei with \u03b2df branching ratios greater than 1% (Pf = P0f \u2265 1%) among 72 model variations (see text for details).

These nuclei may be reachable in the future with fusion evaporation, transfer reactions, or similar techniques.\nFurther reinforcement that future experimental campaigns may reach measurable \u03b2df branchings comes from the observation that the number of nuclei with Pf > 1% increases quadratically with increasing neutron number beyond what has been measured. This behavior arises from the above model variations and is shown in Fig. 7. The functional form can be written as\nCPf>1% \u2248 0.8866\u00d7 n 2 + 3.355\u00d7 n\u2212 3.618 , (15)\n100\n102\n104\n106\n108\n110\nPr ot\non n\num be\nr, Z\nwhere the coefficients arise from a fit to the observed trend and n measures the distance from the maximum neutron number in NuBase (2020). The neutrons counted beyond NuBase (2020) should be n \u2265 1 when using this equation, owing to the negative value of the last coefficient. While n implicitly depends on proton number, the ensemble averaged quantity, represented by CPf>1%, is insensitive to it. This finding comes from the increase of Q\u03b2 values, the decrease of S1n, and rather smooth behavior of predicted fission barriers along isotopic chains. With sufficient enough neutron excess, this observed behavior will break down as the predicted N = 184 shell closure is breached. Nevertheless, Equation 15 provides a simple picture for how close experimental efforts are to probing significant delayed fission probabilities."

We show that the number of nuclei with \u03b2df branching increases quadratically with neutron excess relative to current experimental reach.
