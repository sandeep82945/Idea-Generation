Many companies have adopted digital-based business models to continue their activities and save some of their revenues. Simultaneously, mobile applications have been developed to monitor the pandemic\u2019s evolution. Researchers are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to better understand the virus and accelerate the development of new vaccines. In some countries, internet use increased by 60% shortly after the outbreak (OCDE, 2020), which proves the digital acceleration. Countries are therefore facing a major challenge. Economies are unlikely to return to \u201cpre-COVID\u201d models. The crisis has clarified the potential of digital technologies. Moreover, our daily activities, such as jobs, education, health, public services, and even social interactions, will be more dependent on technology in the future. Many researchers\nFrontiers in Sociology 01 frontiersin.org\nhave defined digitalization as a social-technical phenomenon involving the shift to the daily use of technology in life and business. Among them, we cite El Sawy et al. (2016), Legner et al. (2017), Muro et al. (2017), Alt (2018), Clarke (2019), Chapco-Wade (2018), Sandberg et al. (2020), and Corrocher and Ordanini (2002).\nIn this paper, we refer to digitalization as the use of digital technologies in day-to-day business life. The growing importance of digital technologies and communication infrastructures in individuals\u2019 daily lives, especially in doing work tasks, reveals that companies are increasingly tending to place digital strategies at the heart of their action plans. As countries focus on addressing the COVID-19 crisis and organizing the recovery, it is time for the labor market to work toward an inclusive digital transformation that strengthens the business systems.\nThe effect of the pandemic on the labor market was remarkable (Piros\u0327c et al., 2021). The COVID-19 crisis has reinforced the importance of digital skills and accelerated digital transformation in businesses. The global labor force moves during a brief period to online work and intensive use of new technologies in several fields such as public administration and the health sector.\nIn such a situation, all companies must ensure that the labor force can consider the automation process as a weapon in market competition (Madakam et al., 2019). Digital skills become a crucial requirement to be competitive in the labor market. With the online working process, employees need to master the working digital tools, interact with others, and be more productive. Having digital knowledge is more likely to be common among people, but mastering digital skills is another story. Nowadays, finding a job requires having advanced digital skills. Various studies concluded a clear correlation between higher salaries and digital abilities.\nThe continuous improvement of labor market infrastructures in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries1 and their engagement in impressive national revolution strategies such as the Saudi Vision 2030, Qatar National Vision 2030, and Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 will increase the efficiency across all the sectors mostly due to digitalization. A competitive company requires a skilled digital labor force capable of dealing with changes in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector. Nevertheless, the GCC countries suffer from a shortage of skilled workers. According to Stragtegy Report (2022), the number of digital jobs in the GCC is low compared to other countries. We count only 1.7% of digital jobs in the GCC countries and 5.4% on average in European Union countries. Ninety-three percent of the digital\n1 Gulf Cooperation Council countries include the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, and Bahrain.\nGCC workforce are graduates from foreign universities. This is mainly due to some shortages in the GCC education system which is not updated with the technological changes. Indeed, the region\u2019s human capital assessment falls significantly behind the world average. UNDP\u2019s Arab Human Development Reports and the two Arab World Competitiveness Reports (2002\u20132003 and 2005) stressed that education, research, and development are weak in the region and that education systems lack relevance through systems focusing on inputs rather than outcomes. This critical shortage \u201cexacerbates other problems associated with importing both foreign workers and technologies\u201d (Davis and Hayashi, 2007).\nAccording to Figure 1A, we use ICT imports as a proxy for digitalization in GCC and advanced countries. The digital economic index classifies countries into the following three groups: digital creators, digital adopters, and digital disruptors. The GCC countries belong to the group of digital adopters which makes them dependent on digital creators, through the imports of ICT.\nSince 2015 and after the reform plans of Saudi Arabia, Emirates, and Qatar, GCC economies have recorded important digital sector growth to become more competitive in the global market. They can now host strong multinational firms.\nFigure 1B shows that the percentage of employed persons is higher in GCC countries than in advanced countries. This is mainly due to the importance of manual jobs that did not require any advanced skills. Thus, companies increase the number of hires to improve productivity. Since 2018, we record a slight decrease in employment which can be explained by the growth of the digital sector which requires fewer nonskilled workers. The shortage of workers with advanced technical skills reduces the employment rate. In fact, the employment rate in GCC countries is calculated using the participation of national workers in the labor force, not foreign workers.\nThe situation of the GCC countries was controverted in the literature. Therefore, this paper attempts to explore digitalization\u2019s impact on labor market indicators. The novelty of this paper is to be an innovative study on the impact of modern technologies use after the COVID-19 outbreak on employment for GCC countries from different perspectives: industrial sector, services sector, and women\u2019s participation in the labor force. Moreover, we compare the performance of the GCC countries to some selected advanced countries to find out recommendations to support the GCC job market in the digital era.\nThe paper is presented as follows: after a concise presentation of the main research problem, the first section introduces the literature review. The second section defines the data and the methodology used in the paper, followed by the empirical results, and finally, in the fourth section, we present the conclusion and the recommendations.\nFrontiers in Sociology 02 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Technology and labor market variables rely on macroeconomic theories, typically the growth models where technology, labor, and capital are the most important key factors that generate economic growth. Several studies confirmed that digitalization fundamentally changes the nature of work. Modern technologies impact the labor market in many aspects such as reducing the routine of automated work and increasing the demand and pay for highly skilled technical workers. The process of work digitalization in the last decades has gone through various stages, and there is no doubt that during the COVID-19 pandemic it was significantly modified and accelerated (Sam, 2020; Janeska and Lozanoska, 2021).\nSchilir\u00f2\u2019s (2021) study, on digital transformations during the COVID-19 pandemic, shows that digital transformation causes several changes in the economy and society and these changes may be beneficial for one and harmful for others. The substitution of workers for machines will produce counterbalancing forces by increasing the number of lost jobs on the one hand and by creating new types of jobs on the other hand.\nAn empirical paper by Katz et al. (2021) provides various approaches to measure job gains and losses due to automation. Their application in Chile indicated that lost jobs are equal to the jobs created; thereby it results in a slight impact on the labor force. However, the jobs created are mainly addressed to workers with a high degree of education. Their results indicate probable social marginalization impacts, as some weak groups of workers will face the risk of losing their businesses due to their low level of education and income. Another paper by Jongwanich et al. (2022) examined the impact of advanced technology (proxies by ICT) on variations in employment and revenue in Thailand. The\nresults show that advanced technology cannot push workers out of the labormarket, but it reallocates the workers between skilled and unskilled positions.\nThe digital revolution brings new ways of working but cannot be a solution to all the problems. Wisskirchen (2017) argues that the high level of unemployment in some sectors cannot be avoided by the introduction of new technologies, but it will be a shift in some work areas especially in the services sector, by allowing some workers to benefit from flexible work time and workplace through the remote work. However, Denishin (2020) argues that the impact of digitalization is still not clear. Manual jobs have still a high impact on the economy globally and the industrial sector especially. Thus, we cannot think about the alternative of zero manual jobs in the future, but we have to explore the alternative that robots and individuals can work together side by side. These findings are confirmed by Idris et al. (2021) in their research on the effect of hightechnology trade on employment. The authors confirmed that there is evidence of a negative relationship between high-tech trade and employment. Ill\u00e9ssy et al. (2021) stated that highly qualified employees are more likely to get a job and stay in their jobs.\nDespite the national effects, digitalization reinforces the attractiveness of countries in the international market and helps to improve business practices in the international business world. A paper by Bezrukova et al. (2022) on the effect of digitalization on the expansion of the world economy finds that the European Union member states have developed and implemented digital technologies to reach a high economic expansion and a competitive business environment. Vasilescu et al. (2020) tried to investigate if digitalization leads to creating vulnerable citizens or countries groups by focusing only on their digital skills. The survey of EU citizens (2020) shows that people with a high level of digital skills have\nFrontiers in Sociology 03 frontiersin.org\na confident perception of the effect of technologies on the economy.\nThe unemployment rate is one important indicator of the labor market. Controversial studies tried to identify the relationship between digital technology expansion, ICT developments, and unemployment. Among them, Abbasabadi and Soleimani (2021) used the following three indexes of technology: the ICT development index, the digital index, and the technological readiness index. Their findings revealed a clear relationship between unemployment and digital technology indexes for 163 countries. As digital technologies are expanding, unemployment grows to a maximum and then begins to decline as technology expansion exceeds a specific value. Another study by Neffati and Gouider (2019) analyzed the socioeconomic effects of digitization in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by using data covering the period from 1981 to 2016. Their results show a significant negative relationship between digitalization and unemployment. These findings are confirmed by Bas\u0327ol and Yal\u00e7in (2021) and Ivanitskaia (2022).\nFor the GCC countries, the Ideation Center Insight Report (2017) demonstrates that GCC countries are engaged in national transformation plans such as the 2030 vision in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to increase efficiency across all sectors through digitalization. GCC countries still need a comprehensive strategy to focus on boosting digital high skills and developing a more skilled workforce that can adapt easily to modern technologies, besides creating attractive employment chances. The cultural norms and some restrictive gender rules applied in GCC countries are holding women back from joining the workforce. Since 2015, the reform plans applied in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, as well as new policies are encouraging women to join the workforce and increase their visibility in the labor market. Gadi (2021) focuses on the obstacles to women\u2019s participation in the GCC labor market and the author shows that insufficient experience and training in digital technology were the main identified obstacles."

According to Hill et al. (2011), stationarity is a prior condition to any regression. All variables should be stationary to prevent any statistical problems in the regression.

Panel ARDL methods are characterized by ranges of benefits that permit estimating different variables with different orders of stationarity as expressed in Table 5. The Panel ARDL model is very useful when investigating the short and long-run relationship between digitalization and labor market indicators (Pedroni, 2004), it can be formulated as follows:\nyi,t = \u03b1i + \u03b4iyi,t\u22121 + \u03b2ixi,t +\np\u2211\nj=1\n\u03b3ijyit\u2212j +\nq\u2211\nj=0\n\u03d1ijXij + \u00b5it (4)\nwhere the parameter \u03b4i captures adjustment toward long-run equilibrium, p, q is the optimal lag length determined by the AIC criterion. The endogenous variable yt represents different indicators from the labor market, and the exogenous variable Xt represents ICT, mobile subscription, and trademark applications.\nThe results of the Panel ARDL model are summarized in Table 7 below. According to the first part (a) referring to GCC countries, the long-run relation between employment in the industrial sector and the variables of interest (Model 2), shows that Mobile and Tram positively affected industry\nFrontiers in Sociology 07 frontiersin.org\nemployment at a 1% significance level, while ICT has a significant negative impact on industry employment at 1%. This result can be explained by the importance of the oil industry in the Gulf region. The petroleum leading country in the region is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Since 2016, the country, and especially ARAMCO is engaged in many digital transformations to meet the world\u2019s energy needs. The Emirates with ADNOC company are shifting from a traditional oil company to an innovative international energy company in the era of oil and Gas 4.0. Thus, the new automatization of the oil industry in the region increased the unemployment in this sector due to a shortage of national skilled workers. These results for GCC countries are confirmed by Al Qudah et al. (2016) and Wisskirchen (2017). The second interesting result for the GCC countries is the negative long-run coefficient for a mobile subscription that negatively affects employment in the services sector. Many GCC countries, since the COVID19 pandemic provided an online portal that operates as an\nentry point to digital public services. Since that time, people become more familiar with e-services, and they do not need any more to visit governmental entities to apply for public services so this impact negatively the employment rate in the sector. One can cite various public applications such as TAWAKALNA for Saudi Arabia, TAMM for Emirates, and TAWASUL for Bahrain. Indeed, GCC governments continue to improve and innovate in the public sector to be competitive compared to other countries.\nModel 4 results show that Mobile and Tram positively affect women\u2019s employment, but the results are not significant. Thus, we cannot conclude a clear relationship between these variables. Indeed, in the GCC countries, women\u2019s participation in the labor market and the number of business owners were lower compared to men before 2015. The new reform plans adopted after 2015, especially in Saudi Arabia are likely to increase women\u2019s involvement in the labor market, Elhaj and Pawar (2019).\nFrontiers in Sociology 08 frontiersin.org\nTABLE 7 Panel ARDL results.\nModel 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4\nGCC countries (a)\nLong-run Equation\nIct \u22120.000600 \u22120.0049440*** \u22120.015521 \u22122.561476\nMobile 0.1093993*** 0.046475*** \u22120.405479*** 0.270937\nTram \u22120.137944*** 0.106300*** 0.793005*** 2.059094\nShort-run equation\nCointeQ01 \u22120.131353 \u22120.300004** \u22120.88190 \u22120.076496\nD [Dependant variable (-1)] 0.336958*** 0.203298 0.165236 1.189479\nD (ict) 0.001714 \u22120.008856 \u22120.00326 0.150450\nD (Mobile) \u22120.011846 \u22120.004859 \u22120.012023 \u22120.097120\nD (Tram) 0.008838 0.001553 \u22120.005784 \u22120.149204\nAIC criteria \u22125.751198 \u22123.917388 \u22125.314600 \u22123.166857\nSchwarz criteria \u22124.427140 \u22123.011453 \u22123.990541 \u22121.842798\nLog Likelihood 402.0719 274.0433 375.8760 247.0114\nAdvanced countries (b)\nLong-run Equation\nIct 0.159112*** 0.275712*** \u22120.095697*** \u22120.374650***\nMobile 0.082525*** \u22120.065814* 0.008114 0.085861\nTram \u22120.0113448*** \u22120.073502*** 0.012615*** 0.198459**\nShort-run equation\nCointeQ01 \u22120.289455*** \u22120.358416*** \u22120.263254*** \u22120.202385*\nD [Dependant variable(\u22121)] 0.452032*** \u22120.065845** \u22120.008722\nD (ict) \u22120.050052 \u22120.118144*** 0.028629*** \u22120.003235\nD (Mobile) \u22120.046554 \u22120.063591 0.010265 0.092303\nD (Tram) 0.113003*** 0.038430 \u22120.001031 \u22120.011340\nAIC criteria \u22125.555948 \u22125.194752 \u22127.185032 \u22125.357264\nSchwarz criteria \u22124.272868 \u22124.046733 \u22126.307136 \u22124.614429\nLog Likelihood 407.0247 378.2694 491.6570 370.5076\n***, **, and * denote 1, 5, and 10% significant levels, respectively.\nFor the advanced countries group, the results of Model 1 show that ICT and Mobile affect positively total employment at a 1% level of significance. Model 2 shows a positive relation between employment in the industrial sector and ICT, the relationship is significant at a 1% level. Regarding employment in the services sector, only the variable Tram has a positive and significant impact. Finally, the results present a positive impact of Mobile and Tram on the integration of businesswomen in the labor market. These results are explained by the important proportion of national skilled workers in the labor market. This is not the case for the GCC countries where an important number of skilled expatriates\u2019 workers are dominating the digital labor force compared to the national skilled workers. This gap is mainly due to the mismatching of the educational and training systems in these countries with the job market requirements which impacts the employment rate.\nConsidering the short-run equation (Table 7), the coefficient cointeQ01 shows the error correction mechanism ECM, which explores the speed of convergences to equilibrium from the short run to the long run per 1 year. The sign of this coefficient is negative and significant at 1% for GCC Model 2 when industry employment was the dependent variable. It shows a 30.0004% adjustment in industry employment from the short run to the long run annually. In other words, to achieve long-run equilibrium, the GCCs will need 3.33 years. For the Advanced countries group, all the models show the significance of the error correction mechanism ECM, with respectively 28.9455% for Model 1; 35.8416% for Model 2; 26.3254% for Model 3, and 20.2385% for Model 4. Therefore, the advanced countries will achieve the long-run equilibrium faster than the GCC countries for employment in the industrial sector with 2.79 years and will record a slower adjustment speed for total employment, employment in the services sector,\nFrontiers in Sociology 09 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Digitalization is a significant factor that influences labor market indicators, and it gains importance after the COVID19 outbreak. The growing expansion of digital technologies and communication infrastructures in the daily lives of individuals and businesses needs a qualified labor force to work toward an inclusive digital transformation that strengthens the business systems.\nThis paper is an attempt to investigate the effect of digitalization on employment from different perspectives by comparing GCC countries and some selected advanced countries. Using an autoregressive distributed model for the period 2000\u20132020, the results of the Panel ARDL model show that for GCC countries, mobile subscriptions, and trademarks positively affected industry employment, while ICT has a significant negative impact on industry employment. There is a negative relationship between ICT and mobile subscriptions on the one hand, and services employment, on the other hand, these results confirm the findings of Wisskirchen (2017). Regarding the integration of women into the labor market, mobile subscriptions and trademark applications positively affect women\u2019s employment.\nFrontiers in Sociology 11 frontiersin.org\nFor the advanced countries group, the results show that the ICTs and mobile subscriptions are the main support for employment in the industrial and services sector. Regarding the long-term adjustment speed, all the results are significant for the developed countries, while the GCC countries suffer from disequilibrium in the long run and a slow adjustment toward the long-term equilibrium.\nThese results can be explained by the need of GCC countries to develop research and development to support the adoption of digitalization. Since the end of the COVID-19 outbreak, the governments of GCC countries become more aware of the importance of digitalization in the job market. Although the fast growth in the number of companies and startups in the region, the propagation of innovative digital technologies in the labor market is still very low. According to the report of Strategy and Middle East (2022), the share of big data companies per million inhabitants is between 0 and 2.5 compared to an average of 4.4 for advanced countries.\nThe recommendations provided by the research are to focus on three main areas in the GCC countries to limit the digital gap compared to the advanced countries. The first area is to focus on the development of the national labor force with advanced digital skills with training and companies\u2019 engagement to ensure a durable digital economy (Schilir\u00f2, 2021). The second area is to reinforce research and innovation through the review of the educational process to meet the new requirements of the job market. The third area is the localization of digital products. GCC countries should work on formulating strategies for technology transfer to reduce the imports of new technologies that will be costly for the government to train the labor force on them."
