Cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay were conducted for measuring cell viability and membrane permeability. Double immuno uorescence was performed to determine the pyroptotic cells. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe morphological changes of pyroptosis. Pyroptosis-associated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting.\nResults: The OGD/R treatment reduced cell viability, increased pyroptotic cells and released LDH compared to the control group. TEM showed membrane pore formation of pyroptosis. Immuno uorescence showed that GSDMD was translocated from cytoplasm to membrane after OGD/R treatment. Western blotting showed that the expression of DDX3X, and pyroptosis-related proteins (NLRP3, cleaved-Caspase1, and GSDMD-N) were increased after OGD/R treatment. Nevertheless, DDX3X knockdown markedly improved cell viability and reduced LDH release, expression of pyroptosis-related proteins, and N2a cells pyroptosis. Interestingly, DDX3X knockdown signi cantly inhibited membrane pore formation and GSDMD translocation from cytoplasm to membrane.\nConclusions: This research demonstrates for the rst time that DDX3X knockdown attenuates OGD/R\u2010induced NLRP3 in ammasome activation and pyroptosis, which implies that DDX3X may become a potential therapeutic target for cerebral I/R injury.\nIntroduction Cerebral ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with high rates of morbidity, mortality, and disability[1]. The most effective treatment is to restore blood perfusion in occluded arteries. However, reperfusion may lead to cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, eventually resulting in various programmed cell death[2]. Previous studies have reported the three main types of programmed cell death in stroke: apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy[3, 4]. Recently, pyroptosis, a speci c type of programmed cell death, was observed in cerebral I/R injury[5, 6]. Pyroptosis can destroy the integrity of cell membranes, resulting in in ammatory cytokines and cellular contents secretion through the pores formed in the plasma membrane by GSDMD[7]. It has been shown that pyroptosis could be triggered by ischemic stroke or cerebral I/R injury[5, 8]. However, the molecular mechanisms of pyroptosis during cerebral I/R injury remain elusive. Thus, inhibiting speci c genes and proteins associated with pyroptosis may be an underlying therapeutic measure for cerebral I/R injury after stroke.\nPage 3/16\nPyroptosis is divided into the canonical in ammasome pathway and the noncanonical pathway according to whether it depends on caspase-1. In the canonical in ammasome pathway, the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) in ammasome-mediated pyroptosis has been widely known and extensively studied, which is associated with neuronal death in cerebral I/R injury[9]. The activation of NLRP3 in ammasome induces the release of active caspase-1. Active caspase-1 can cleave the gasdermin D (GSDMD), resulting in membrane pore formation, and leading to a rupture form of cell death[10]. DDX3X, an ATPase/RNA helicase of the DEAD-box family, is associated with RNA metabolism, cell cycle, apoptosis, and various diseases, such as in ammation, cancer, and infection[11, 12]. Importantly, recent research showed that DDX3X could serve as a positive regulator of the NLRP3 in ammasome[13]. Moreover, NLRP3 in ammasome activation by DDX3X has repeatedly been proved in a large number of studies[14\u201316]. However, the function of DDX3X in cerebral I/R injury has not been reported.\nThe oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model is widely used to study cerebral I/R injury in vitro[17, 18]. In this study, OGD/R-induced mouse neuro2a (N2a) cells injury were used to mimic a model of cerebral I/R injury in vitro. We aimed to study whether DDX3X de ciency attenuates NLRP3 in ammasome-mediated N2a cells pyroptosis after OGD/R treatment.\nMaterials And Methods\nCell culture and Oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) N2a cells were purchased from the National Collection of Authenticated Cell Culture (https://cellbank.org.cn). N2a cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (BI) and cultured in an incubator (37\u00b0C, and 5% CO2). OGD/R model was carried out as previously described with modi cation[19]. Brie y, For the induction of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), cells were washed with PBS and maintained within the glucose-free DMEM medium (Gibco) in the incubator containing 95% N2 and 5% CO2 for different times (2h, 3h, and 4h) at 37\u00b0C. For reoxygenation, cells were then incubated again in a normoxic incubator with fresh DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 24h. The cells that were not exposed to OGD/R were de ned as control group. Cell transfection The siRNA targeting mouse DDX3X (siRNA) and negative control siRNA (siRNA NC) were designed and purchased from Ruibo Biotechnology (Guangzhou, China). Three different siRNAs speci c sequences: siRNA1, CCTGAACTCTTCAGATAAT; siRNA2, GGATTTACTGGATCTTCTT; siRNA3, GCAGTCGTGGACGTTCTAA. The siRNA NC was used as the negative control for siRNA silencing. OptiMEM serum-free medium (Gibco) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) were used for siRNA transfection. Brie y, N2a cells were inoculated into 6-well plates at a density of 3 \u00d7 105 or 96-well plates at a density of 1 \u00d7 105. After 12h, siRNAs and siRNA NC were transfected respectively into N2a cells by Lip2000 according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The nal concentration of siRNAs or siRNA NC in\nPage 4/16\ntransfection mixes was 50 nM. Following incubation at 37\u02daC for 6 h, the culture medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing serum. After additional incubation at 37\u02daC for 18 h, cells were used to perform the OGD/R treatment. The cells were randomized into 4 groups, including Control group, OGD/R group, OGD/R + siRNA group, and OGD/R + siRNA NC group. Cell viability assay Cell viability was determined with the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) (Vazyme) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. After OGD/R, CCK-8 solution (10 \u00b5l/well) was added to 96-well plates and plates were cultured in an incubator (37\u00b0C, and 5% CO2) for 2h. Finally, the absorbance was detected at 450 nm with an enzyme\u2010labeled instrument. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay LDH release was detected using the LDH-Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (Beyotime) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. After OGD/R, the culture medium was collected and centrifuged (11000\u00d7g, 15min,4\u02daC) to obtain the supernatants. The absorbance of the supernatants was detected at 450 nm with an enzyme\u2010labeled instrument. RNA extraction and qRT-PCR After OGD/R, total cellular RNA was extracted by RNA isolater Total RNA Extraction Reagent (Vazyme). The quality of RNA was detected by NanoDrop 2000 (ThermoFisher Scienti c). Furthermore, the value of 260/280 > 1.8 was required for RNA samples. cDNA was prepared and synthesized by HiScript III RT SuperMix for qPCR(+ gDNA wiper) (Vazyme). The mRNA levels were measured with the Taq Pro Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme) on a CFX96 Real\u2010Time PCR Detection System (Bio\u2010Rad). PCR ampli cation was processed by two-step cycling method: 95\u00b0C for 30s, 40 cycles, 95\u00b0C for 10s, and 60\u00b0C for 30s. The data were calculated using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Cq relative quanti cation method. The relative expression levels of the genes were normalized to GAPDH. The primers were as followed: DDX3X forward, 5\u2032- AAGCCGCAGTTCTCCCGT-3\u2032; DDX3X reverse, 5\u2032-TGGGATATAACGCCCTTTGCT-3\u2019. GAPDH forward, 5\u2032- CAGTGGCAAAGTGGAGATTGTTG-3\u2032; GAPDH reverse,5\u2032- TCGCTCCTGGAAGATGGTGAT-3\u2019. Western Blot Analysis After OGD/R, total protein was extracted and collected from N2a cells by RIPA (Beyotime) lysis buffer. The concentration of protein was measured with the BCA protein assay (Beyotime). The protein was mixed with loading buffer and incubated at 96\u00b0C for 5 min. Protein samples (25 \u00b5g) were separated using 10% SDS gel, and transferred to the PVDF membranes (Millipore). Primary antibodies incubation (4\u02daC and overnight): rabbit anti-DDX3X polyclonal antibody (1:1000, Boster Biological Technology), rabbit antiNLRP3 polyclonal antibody (1:500, ProteinTech), rabbit anti-Caspase1 polyclonal antibody (1:1000, ProteinTech), rabbit anti-GSDMD polyclonal antibody (1:1000, A nity). Then these membranes were washed three times and subsequently incubated by the following secondary antibody for 1h at 37 \u02daC: HRP-conjugated A nipure Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG(H + L) (1:5000, ProteinTech). The immunoblots were\nPage 5/16\nmeasured and scanned by a chemiluminescent analyzer. Relative western blotting intensities were analyzed using Image-Pro Plus software. Immuno uorescence and TUNEL staining Immuno uorescence staining in N2a cells was performed as previously described[20]. The N2a cells were plated on sterile coverslips. After treatment, the cells were xed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Then cells were blocked and permeabilized in 3% BSA and 0.2% TritonX-100. Subsequently, primary antibodies incubation (4\u02daC and overnight): rabbit anti-cleaved-Caspase1 polyclonal antibody (1:100, A nity), rabbit anti-NLRP3 polyclonal antibody (1:200, ProteinTech), rabbit anti-GSDMD polyclonal antibody (1:100, A nity). After washing, the secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, Cy3 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:400, Boster Biological Technology), Subsequently, cells were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma) for staining the nuclei. TUNEL staining (Boster Biological Technology) was used to count the dead cells as previously described[21]. Samples were imaged by uorescence microscopy (IX71, Olympus). Images were analyzed using Image Pro-Plus software. Transmission electron microscopy Transmission electron microscopy was performed as described previously[22]. N2a cells were collected and sectioned (1 mm3), xed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 24 h at 4\u2103, and then xed with 1% osmic acid for 1 h. Finally, samples were observed by transmission electron microscopes (JEM-1400, Japan). Statistical analysis All data were expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. All calculations were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 25.0. The differences among multiple groups were evaluated using one-way or two-way analysis by Tukey\u2019s post hoc multiple comparison test. P < 0.05 was de ned as statistically signi cant.\nResults\nDDX3X expression in OGD/R-treated N2a cells and siRNAs validation After OGD exposure for different times (2h, 3h, 4h), the number of adherent cells was reduced, and partially injured cells oated to form clusters (Fig.\u00a01A). Cell viability was evaluated using a CCK8 assay and results were presented as a percentage of the normal control. Results from the CCK8 assay showed that the survival rate of N2a cells decreased after OGD compared to the normal control, and the decrease was time-dependent (Fig.\u00a01B). After analyzing the time course of cell viability, we chose 3h OGD, which led to a nearly 50% decrease in cell viability, for the subsequent experiments. RT\u2010qPCR and western blot were performed to measure DDX3X expression at different reoxygenation times (8h, 12h, and 24h) in N2a cells after OGD3h treatment. In particular, expression of DDX3X mRNA was remarkably increased in the group that received 12-hour reoxygenation but signi cantly decreased following 24-hour reoxygenation\nPage 6/16\n(Fig.\u00a01C). The results showed that DDX3X protein expression increased along with the duration of reoxygenation after OGD3h (Fig.\u00a01D, E).\nIn addition, validation of siRNA targeting for DDX3X. Three siRNAs were selected to knock down DDX3X expression. The results showed that expression of DDX3X mRNA was signi cantly inhibited by siRNA 2(Fig.\u00a01F). SiRNA 2 was used to inhibit the DDX3X expression in N2a cells treated with OGD/R.\nDDX3X knockdown attenuated OGD/R-induced pyroptosis and NLRP3 in ammasome activation.\nTo evaluate whether OGD/R exposure induced pyroptosis, the LDH cytotoxicity assay was performed since membrane permeability changes are an important pyroptosis indicator[23, 24]. The pyroptotic cells was determined by immuno uorescence double staining of cleaved-Caspase1 and TUNEL[9].Morphological changes of pyroptosis were observed by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)[25]. Western blot assays and immuno uorescence staining were performed to measure NLRP3 in ammasome activation. The results showed that OGD/R treatment decreased the cell viability and increased the level of LDH when compared to the control group. DDX3X knockdown markedly improved cell viability and decreased LDH release as compared with the OGD/R group (Fig.\u00a02A, B). Immuno uorescence staining revealed that the number of cleaved-caspase1 and TUNEL double-positive cells were increased in the OGD/R group, suggesting that OGD/R injury induced pyroptosis. However, DDX3X knockdown could reduce the number of cleaved-caspase1 and TUNEL double-positive cells (Fig.\u00a02C, D). TEM images revealed that typical pathological changes of OGD/R-induced pyroptosis was observed, such as cell swelling, pore formation in the plasma membrane, and rupture or lysis of the membrane. Nevertheless, compared with the OGD/R group, DDX3X knockdown reduced the number of membrane pores (Fig.\u00a02E).\nMoreover, compared to the control group, western blotting showed that the protein expression of DDX3X, NLRP3, cleaved-Caspase1, and GSDMD-N were upregulated after OGD/R treatment. And this growing trend was inhibited signi cantly by the knockdown of DDX3X (Fig.\u00a03A-E). Immuno uorescence staining showed that the mean uorescence intensity of NLRP3 was enhanced after OGD/R treatment. However, DDX3X knockdown reduced the mean uorescence intensity of NLRP3 (Fig.\u00a03F).\nDDX3X knockdown inhibited the GSDMD translocation in N2a cells after OGD/R injury GSDMD results in pyroptosis by forming membrane pores, and the process of GSDMD shift from cytoplasm to the membrane is the critical step for pyroptosis[26]. Therefore, the location of GSDMD was detected in various groups. Immuno uorescence results showed that GSDMD was translocated from cytoplasm to membrane in N2a cells after OGD/R treatment. Interestingly, DDX3X knockdown signi cantly reduced GSDMD translocation. The lower uorescence intensity of GSDMD in the OGD/R + siRNA group also indicated that the DDX3X knockdown reduced pyroptosis (Fig.\u00a04A, B).\nPage 7/16\nDiscussion In our study, we demonstrated for the rst time that DDX3X expression was upregulated after OGD/R injury. DDX3X participates in the activation of NLRP3 in ammasome and N2a cells pyroptosis induced by OGD/R. Notably, DDX3X knockdown attenuated OGD/R\u2010induced NLRP3 in ammasome activation and N2a cells pyroptosis. Therefore, these results suggested that DDX3X may become a potential therapeutic target for cerebral I/R injury.\nPyroptosis is an in ammatory form of programmed cell death that can aggravate in ammatory responses[27]. Previous study showed that pyroptosis could be triggered by cerebral I/R injury in vivo[28]. Pyroptosis and related in ammatory responses are commonly acknowledged as one of the important pathophysiological mechanisms in I/R injury after cerebral ischemic stroke[29]. In ammasomes, especially NLRP3, are the core of in ammatory response, and activation of the in ammasome is the critical step to the occurrence of pyroptosis. NLRP3 in ammasome is a protein complex composed of NLRP3, ASC and procaspase1. NLRP3 in ammasome can cleave procaspase1 forming active cleaved caspase1. Subsequently, cleaved caspase1 can cleave GSDMD into GSDMD-N, and then translocate to the plasma membrane to form transmembrane pores and inducing pyroptosis[30]. Moreover, pyroptosisrelated in ammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, will have been released to aggravate brain tissue injury and in ammatory responses[31].\nIncreasing evidence has demonstrated that NLRP3 in ammasome-mediated pyroptosis plays a key role in the process of OGD/R injury [32, 33]. Consistent with these studies, our study showed that expression of NLRP3, cleaved Caspase-1, GSDMD-N and LDH release was signi cantly upregulated in cells after OGD/R treatment. Furthermore, we newly found that the number of cleaved-caspase1 and TUNEL double positive cells were upregulated after OGD/R treatment. GSDMD is a key factor in the process of pyroptosis, and GSDMD-N is strongly related to the formation of membrane pores[7]. Interestingly, our study found that the OGD/R treatment induced the GSDMD translocation from the cytoplasm to the membrane and typical pore formation in the plasma membrane. These ndings indicated that OGD/R injury can directly trigger pyroptosis by activating the NLRP3 in ammasome.\nThe activation of NLRP3 in ammasomes is the crucial step for the initiation of pyroptosis. Currently, it is generally accepted that activation of NLRP3 in ammasome involves mainly three pathways: First, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been considered to be a signal for the activation of NLRP3 in ammasome downstream of mitochondrial dysfunction[34]. Second, lysosomal membrane disruption can activate NLRP3 in ammasome[35]. Third, ion e ux is also considered to be the important factor upstream of NLRP3 in ammasome activation[36]. Besides these three pathways, novel underlying mechanisms of regulating activation of NLRP3 in ammasome have been reported in cerebral I/R models. For example, Wang et al[37]. found that noncoding RNAs, such as miR-139, protects against OGD/Rinduced injury through targeting c-Jun to inhibit NLRP3 in ammasome activation. Shi et al[38]. reported that activation of GABAa receptor attenuates cerebral I/R injury by inhibiting of NLRP3 in ammasomedependent pyroptosis. Recently, Samir reported that DDX3X could act as the upstream positive regulator\nPage 8/16\nof the NLRP3 in ammasome[13]. Moreover, the regulation activation of NLRP3 in ammasome by DDX3X has been proved in animal models of various neurological diseases, such as spinal cord injury[16], cognitive impairment[14]. Nevertheless, there has not been a study revealing the relationship between DDX3X and cerebral I/R injury. Our study results discovered for the rst time that DDX3X expression was upregulated in N2a cells after OGD/R injury. Remarkably, DDX3X siRNA administration signi cantly reduced the expression of NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, GSDMD-N in N2a cells after OGD/R treatment. These similar results agreed with previously study[16]. Moreover, DDX3X knockdown improved cell viability, and reduced LDH release, the number of double positive cells, formation of membrane pores. Interestingly, DDX3X knockdown signi cantly inhibited GSDMD translocation from cytoplasm to membrane in N2a cells after OGD/R treatment. These results likely indicated that DDX3X reduced N2a cells pyroptosis by inhibiting activation of NLRP3 in ammasome, and also suggested DDX3X may become underlying target to regulate NLRP3 in ammasome-mediated pyroptosis for cerebral I/R injury.\nIt is currently believed that DDX3X could interact with NLRP3 to drive NLRP3 in ammasome assembly and activation via binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3[13, 39]. Recently, Wang et al[16]. newly found that DDX3X plays the important role in TLR4-induced NLRP3 in ammasome activation and microglial pyroptosis in vivo or in vitro experiments. These studies indicate that DDX3X may play a key role for activation of NLRP3 in ammasome and indirectly induce pyroptosis. From our study, expression of DDX3X and NLRP3 was increased in N2a cells after OGD/R treatment. The expression trend of the NLRP3 was reversed by the DDX3X siRNA. Therefore, we speculated that DDX3X played a partial role in the assembly of NLRP3 in ammasome in N2a cells after OGD/R treatment.\nFinally, our current study is not without limitations. First, we used the N2a cell line, which is commonly used cell line in previous study for cerebral I/R models in vitro[40]. However, it cannot completely reproduce the characteristics of primary neurons after OGD/R injury. Our study did not explore the exact regulatory role of DDX3X in the activation of NLRP3 in ammasome. Therefore, further experimental study is required to elucidate the exact mechanisms involved in DDX3X de ciency inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 in ammasome after cerebral I/R injury.\nIn summary, our study demonstrated that DDX3X participates in NLRP3 in ammasome-mediated pyroptosis in N2a cells after OGD/R treatment (Fig.\u00a05). We also found that de ciency of the DDX3X attenuates OGD/R-induced pyroptosis by inhibiting NLRP3 in ammasome activation. However, our present ndings warrant veri cation using in vivo experiments. Thus, further research is required to determine that DDX3X is a potential therapeutic target for cerebral I/R injury.\nDeclarations Funding This study was funded by the Natural Science Foundation Youth Project of Sichuan Province [NO. 2022NSFSC1596]; the Youth Innovation Project of Medical Research in Sichuan Province [NO.
