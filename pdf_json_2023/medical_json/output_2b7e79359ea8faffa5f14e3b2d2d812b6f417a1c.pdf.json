    "abstractText": "We propose a computational framework to study the effect of corrosion on the mechanical strength of m samples. Our work is motivated by the need to predict the residual strength of biomedical Mg implants afte of degradation in a physiological environment. To model corrosion, a mass-diffusion type model is used th localised corrosion using Weibull statistics. The overall mass loss is prescribed (e.g., based on experime mechanical behaviour of the Mg samples is modeled by a state-of-the-art Cazacu-Plunkett-Barlat plastic a coupled damage model. This allowed us to study how Mg degradation in immersed samples reduces strength over time. We performed a large number of in vitro corrosion experiments and mechanical tests computational framework. Our framework could predict both the experimentally observed loss of mechani the ductility due to corrosion for both tension and compression tests.",

The overall mass loss is prescribed (e.g., based on experime mechanical behaviour of the Mg samples is modeled by a state-of-the-art Cazacu-Plunkett-Barlat plastic a coupled damage model. This allowed us to study how Mg degradation in immersed samples reduces strength over time. We performed a large number of in vitro corrosion experiments and mechanical tests computational framework.

Tailoring suitable degradation kinetics for speci remains the focus of current research. In the case of binary Mg-Gd alloys, a minimum corrosion rate w Mg-10Gd [2] in aerated 1% NaCl solution. At higher concentrations of Gd, the corrosion rate increased [7\nComputational modeling can be used to make predictions based on in vitro experiments, thus speedin opment process of new implants if reliable models are developed. Various computational models of Mg d been published to date, including physical, phenomenological, analytical, and machine learning-based mo al. [8] presented a simplified model based on the mass conservation law, but did not include chemical and processes due to the analytical nature of the approach. Other studies used continuum damage mechanics to describe the effect of Mg degradation on a phenomenological level. Gastaldi et al.

The CDM appr the study of the micro-scale geometric discontinuities induced by degradation on the mechanical integrit specimen without explicitly modeling the moving boundary. For addressing the latter, it is required to inclu medium in the analysis, see e.g. [11]. In any case, these approaches do not consider the electrochemica occur during degradation, which may vary locally. As a result, CDMmodel needs to be calibrated for each corrosive environment and material composition. A method for experimentally generating the required dat by Boland et al.

In the same spirit, the present work ing the predictive capabilities of numerical tools towards the ductility quantified by the failure strain as a corrosion time. Corrosion is regarded as initiation for strain localisation and damage initiation. In the fo diffusion type analysis is utilised to model the degradation of a Mg-10Gd alloy. Similar to the procedure de a concentration field representing Faraday\u2019s dissolution-related phase change of magnesium is simulated analysis and subsequently mapped to a variable affecting the local strength in the domain. Based on such a finite element simulation of compression tests and tensile tests is performed to analyse the global mech of the sample that remains at the given point in time due to the corrosion up to that point. In contrast to work, here, the local strength loss and the damage variable are considered in general as independent.

Due to such complex interactions, the sensitivity of the test system to variations of the degradation cond compared to single salt solutions and ambient conditions. Standards were defined for testing the imme of metallic medical devices in electrolytes as ISO 10993-15 standard [34], ASTM NACE/ASTM G31-12 ISO10933 part 12 for non flat, irregular samples. In the present study, the conditions were selected accordin adapted. Immersion conditions were kept constant and equalled an electrolyte volume to test specimen su of 0.125 mL\u2215mm2 for the IB samples, and to 0.020 ml\u2215mm2 for the TS samples. This represents a comp covering the whole sample body with a sufficient amount of immersion medium and meeting the recomme mentioned guidelines. Nevertheless, differences in the corrosion behaviour between the IB and TS samples The more pronounced local degradation of the TS compared to the IB might be attributed to the different vo ratio. In semi-static degradation tests, less volume per surface (ratio between test solution volume and test sp area) leads to a faster increase in pH, which promotes dense deposit layer formation and subsequently sh degradation rate [35].

Second, atter acts on the Jo\nur na\nl P re\n-p ro\nof effects as well as surface defects, it is still possible to observe high degradation rates despite electrolyte and Within this study it was observed that corrosion was suppressed in 3.5% NaCl solutions at pH values Localised corrosion did not appear as already shown by Zeng et al. [36]. However, the cited work show of pH values on the distribution and morphology of corrosion pits. High pH values lead to more local co formation, limited by pH=12, above which corrosion was suppressed. This effect seems to be also existen work, where the rapid increase in pH in the case of TS samples lead to severe local corrosion.\nDue to the described differences in corrosion localisation, it was not expected that an identical Weib of fluxes, as considered in the case of IB samples, would produce the same results as the mechanical TS/MFT samples. Apparently, such reuse of Weibull parameters is generally not possible even if the deg are comparable. Due to the high sensitivity of the pit initiation mechanisms to small variations within th morphology as well as to the local electrolyte conditions, the application of IB/TS calibrated values to the M in general, not possible. If the degradation , in particular, becomes more heterogeneous, this aspect has to b As a consequence and as described in section 5.5, a = 0.01 was chosen to adequately simulate the loca scenario of the tensile samples. To quantify the effect of the Weibull statistics, a numerical study was MFT sample was seeded for mass diffusion (weight loss) analyses with four different Weibull distribution a = 1.0, a = 0.5, a = 0.1, and a = 0.01. For each case, 10 realisations were generated, leading to 40 simu The fluxes were iteratively determined such that they resulted in the same global mass loss in all cases. O sections of the sample were considered to be affected by corrosion. One realization for each of the abov distributions is depicted in Fig. 12. Although the position of the nodal fluxes was randomly chosen in the p the simulations are comparable in the sense that the corrosion conditions were identical. The results of mechanical analyses are depicted in Fig. 13. With increasing localisation, a = 1.0 \u2192 0.01, the maximum by 52%. At the same time, the variation increases. Even more pronounced is the reduction of ductilit the average strain at maximum stress. Even for the \"smooth\" Weibull distribution of a = 1.0, an avera ductility compared to the one of the as-received material of 49% is calculated. a = 0.01 renders a reduc essence, a high localisation level of corrosion leads to a moderate stress reduction, but to a drastic loss of principle, this is neither a contradiction nor surprising: Due to the low strain-hardening of the material, s stress lead to large variations in strain. This is common for as-received material, but it also applies to co with non-uniform cross-sections.\nThe effect of the damage variable d in the analyses of failure is illustrated in Fig. 14. The mapped fie product fOx (see Fig. 14a) has two main effects on mechanics.

By this intera of corrosion pitting can be accounted for in the mechanical model. Although the described model is of phe nature, it appears to be versatile and hence useful for the assessment of medical implants undergoing corr that the results of this in vitro study can be generalised towards in vivo problems. In the current mathematic it is capable of covering the whole range from perfectly uniform degradation to statistically distributed p and its superposition. Intergranular effects as well as effects related to hydrogen uptake are not explicitl they are intrinsically included by the domain damage approach.\nCommonly, FE analyses based on coupled damage models leading to material softening as utilized mesh dependency. Therefore, in the computational study a dependency of results on the discretisation is increasing mesh refinement for a given element formulation, the localisation zone becomes smaller. Hence energy decreases with decreasing element size. While this effect has significant impact in the case of fra simulations, the influence in the case of tensile samples is less pronounced [37]. Further, for the diffusi expected that a higher density of nodes affects the degree of localisation of corrosion.

The predicted ductility falls in the strain interval given by the oth It can therefore be concluded that the conditions of equal mass loss lead to comparable results in case the changed.\nThe damage model, Eqs. 2 and 5, is kept as simple as possible here. The assumed damage nucleation depends on the plastic strain. The damage growth rate does not depend on the stress triaxiality. Conseque does not consider the growth and coalescence of voids and defects. The well\u2013known triaxiality\u2013depend in ductile metals [38] cannot be described.

            "text": "In this paper, a computational framework was developed to study the effect of corrosion on the mecha of Mg samples. Corrosion is modeled by a mass-diffusion type model accounting for, in general, paralle uniform and localised corrosion. To model the statistical effects governing localised corrosion attacks, W is used. In our corrosion model, the overall loss of mass of a sample has to be prescribed (e.g., based o data) to normalise the spatially distributed mass fluxes in the corrosion model properly. The mechanic Mg is modeled by a state-of-the-art CPB plasticity model with a coupled damage model. This allows u Mg degradation in immersed samples reduces the mechanical strength over time. We performed a large rosion experiments and mechanical tests to validate our computational framework in a laboratory setting that our framework could predict for both tension and compression tests the experimentally observed los strength due to corrosion when using extremely sharp Weibull distributions representing pitting corrosion the strength loss due to corrosion, the reduced ductility could be numerically predicted.\nOur study confirmed the importance to consider the surface/volume effect of the samples during corro numerical analysis. It was shown that the conversion of the volume mass loss data via the surface related depth can be an appropriate way to do so. With consideration of calibrated Weibull statistics (e.g. a = uniform\u2013like corrosion, a < 0.1 approximates strong pitting events) the macroscopic mechanical behaviou material can be adequately computed. Adaption of the approach to otherMg alloys andmaterials suffering p is possible but requires carefulWeibull parameter calibration. A general limitation of our current computati is the need to prescribe the overall mass loss to calibrate the boundary conditions of the corrosion mode this limitation, in the future more sophisticated corrosion models are required that can predict the rate of geometry and material of the sample as well as the chemical properties of its environment are given. Such a corrosion model could, for example, rely on a phase-field approach or a peridynamics approach [13, 42]."
