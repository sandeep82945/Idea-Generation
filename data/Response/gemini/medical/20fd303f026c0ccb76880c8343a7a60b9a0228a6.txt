1. **Investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of synchronous advanced adenomas in patients with early-onset colon cancer.** This could involve studying the genetic and epigenetic alterations that occur in these tumors, as well as the role of specific signaling pathways.


2. **Examine the relationship between synchronous neoplasia and the risk of metachronous CRC in patients with early-onset CRC.** This could be done through a prospective study that follows patients with early-onset CRC over time to determine their risk of developing a second CRC.


3. **Evaluate the effectiveness of different surveillance strategies for detecting synchronous and metachronous neoplasia in patients with early-onset CRC.** This could involve comparing the sensitivity and specificity of different screening methods, such as colonoscopy, CT colonography, and fecal immunochemical testing.


4. **Explore the role of lifestyle and environmental factors in the development of synchronous neoplasia in patients with early-onset CRC.** This could involve conducting case-control studies to compare the lifestyle and environmental exposures of patients with early-onset CRC with those of controls.


5. **Develop new therapeutic strategies for patients with early-onset CRC who have synchronous neoplasia.** This could involve developing targeted therapies that specifically target the molecular alterations that are found in these tumors.
