    "abstractText": "Because they are sensitive to mechanical properties of materials and can propagate even in opaque systems, acoustic waves provides us with a powerful tool for local rheological characterization of various systems. While most common acoustic techniques rely on time-of-flight measurements, acoustic spectra of speed and attenuation contain rich information on the propagation medium which led to the development of acoustic spectroscopy techniques. They however remain underused in the field of complex fluids because of the difficulty to interpret quantitatively acoustic signals. In this note, we use a simple ultrasound spectroscopy setup to investigate the gelation dynamics by precipitation of a silica colloidal gel. First, we show that a simple analysis of acoustic attenuation allows to define a gelation time, which is proportional to this obtained with rheological measurements. This validates the possibility to use acoustic spectroscopy for monitoring of gelation process, and our setup also has the possibility to perform mappings, showing that the formed gels display some heterogeneity. By studying in more details acoustic spectra, we finally attempt to relate more precisely acoustic measurements with mechanical parameters of the material.",

While most common acoustic techniques rely on time-of-flight measurements, acoustic spectra of speed and attenuation contain rich information on the propagation medium which led to the development of acoustic spectroscopy techniques. They however remain underused in the field of complex fluids because of the difficulty to interpret quantitatively acoustic signals. In this note, we use a simple ultrasound spectroscopy setup to investigate the gelation dynamics by precipitation of a silica colloidal gel. First, we show that a simple analysis of acoustic attenuation allows to define a gelation time, which is proportional to this obtained with rheological measurements. This validates the possibility to use acoustic spectroscopy for monitoring of gelation process, and our setup also has the possibility to perform mappings, showing that the formed gels display some heterogeneity. By studying in more details acoustic spectra, we finally attempt to relate more precisely acoustic measurements with mechanical parameters of the material.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAcoustic waves are coupled perturbation of deformation and pressure propagating across any material medium (even opaque), that can be longitudinal (associated with compression) or transverse (associated with shear deformations, strongly damped in liquids). Acoustic methods are thus interesting characterization tools, alternative or complementary to their optical counterparts, giving access to different parameters and systems ranging from industry to biomedical research [1\u20135]. In particular, the short wavelengths associated with high-frequency ultrasonic waves offer a satisfactory spatial resolution, typically around a few hundreds of microns in aqueous media. Simple imaging approaches rely essentially on the measurement of time-of-flight of acoustic echoes in heterogeneous system, and thus on sound speed: however, acoustic attenuation also contains rich information.\nIn simple, homogeneous liquids, heat conduction effects on sound propagation are negligible and attenuation is mostly determined by shear viscosity, bulk viscosity and possible relaxation phenomena between molecular energy levels [6, 7]. Acoustic spectroscopy thus appears as an insightful analytic technique, complimentary to more conventional optical methods by giving access to new materials, and commercial devices have been developed to measure sound speed and attenuation spectra. This gave rise to fine studies of microscopic dynamics in simple liquids for instance [8, 9].\nIn complex fluids, relating acoustic spectra to physical parameters is more challenging. In viscoelastic materials, one can define viscoelastic acoustic moduli, analogous to their rheological counterparts despite the very distinct frequency ranges probed by ultrasound and conventional rheometers [10\u201314]. In heterogeneous materials, acoustic propagation is also affected by the shape and by the size distribution of the dispersed phase. For instance, in well controlled suspensions, measured attenuations [15\u201317] can be described by sophisticated models [18\u201324] or by more empirical\napproaches [25, 26]. In spite of these efforts, modeling acoustic spectra remains out of reach for most complex fluids, aside from a few model systems.\nEven without a quantitative interpretation of acoustic spectra, ultrasound spectroscopy remains an interesting tool for complex material characterization and has been occasionally used since the 1950es. By first establishing correlations between acoustic measurements and parameters of interest, it is possible to characterize semi-quantitatively complex systems. Acoustic speed is for instance particularly easy to measure and allows to access elastic properties of the studied material [27, 28]. Moreover, average attenuation, or preferably full attenuation spectra [29], can be used as a proxy for viscosity in many systems (e.g. in food science [30\u201336], biomedical [37\u201339] or pharmaceutical [40, 41] applications). It is then also possible to monitor physico-chemical transformations in time [31, 33, 36, 42]. Such an approach offers promising perspectives for the study of industrial systems. In particular, the technique is easy and cheap to setup, possibly for online monitoring. It gives access to opaque systems, out of reach of common optical techniques. Finally, because of the vanishingly small deformations associated to acoustic wave propagation, it causes minimal disturbance to the system which can be of high interest for instance for thixotropic materials with long relaxation times or fragile materials with very limited linear rheological regime. Despite these promises, acoustic spectroscopy remains underused in the physico-chemistry community.\nAs they are associated with changes of microstructure and mechanical parameters, gelation processes appear as good candidates for acoustic monitoring. Such studies have for instance been performed with various polymer gels [43\u201345]. Colloidal gels constitute a more complex case, as they are both viscoelastic and dispersed materials, and acoustic studies focused on model silica gels obtained by sol-gel processes. They showed a qualitative correlation between rheological measurements and the observed increase of sound speed and\nar X\niv :2\n20 1.\n06 86\n4v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\nof t]\n3 N\nov 2\n02 2\n2 attenuation [46\u201351]. All these systems belong to the group of chemical gels, where mesoscopic elements are linked through chemical bonds.\nSurprisingly, despite their omnipresence in nature and industry and thorough rheological study [52\u201354], no acoustic study of physical gelation processes has been undertaken. In this work, we propose to bridge this gap. We use a simple setup of acoustic spectroscopy which measures sound speed and attenuation spectra during the gelation process. We decided to study the gelation of a colloidal silica suspension induced by aggregation caused by the screening of surface charges by a concentrated brine, leading to a weak gel which can be heterogeneous [55]. This system has already been studied in details through optical and rheological techniques [56\u2013 58] that we use as a guideline for formulation and a reference to compare with our measurements. The formulation of the gel, rheological characterization and the description of the acoustic setup are gathered in Section II.\nIn Section III, we first present rheological characterization of the gelation process. From monitoring of linear viscoelastic moduli over time, we define several gelation times which are of similar order of magnitude and show the same exponential evolution with brine concentration as reported in previous studies. We then propose a simple analysis of acoustic signals: while sound speed do not significantly evolve during gelation, acoustic attenuation continuously increases.Empirically fitting the average attenuation allows us to define an acoustic gelation time, which correlates well with the rheological observations. This proves that our simple acoustic method is representative of the dynamics of mechanical evolution of the gel. We also exploit the possibility to scan the measurement cell with the acoustic beam to map the acoustic properties of a gel in stationary state: we observe some heterogeneities, which could partially explain the sample to sample variability of our measurements.\nFinally, in Section IV, we attempt to relate more precisely our acoustic measurements with rheological parameters by analyzing more carefully the attenuation spectra and their evolution in time, by using two different approaches. First, we compute acoustic viscoelastic moduli and show that viscous modulus allows to define a frequency-dependent characteristic time by an empirical exponential fit. Then, we propose a more physical model considering the attenuation results from the surperposition of this due to the solvent and this due to a single time scale relaxation phenomenon, modeling the effect of the elastic backbone. We finally discuss the compatibility of these two approaches."

In all experiments, we used an initial suspension of silica nanoparticles (Ludox HS-40, Sigma Aldrich) with a 40%wt. content of\nsolid and average particle radius 6nm as specified by the manufacturer. The solution is mixed with a brine made of sodium chloride (NaCl) salt dissolved in deionized water. In order to tune gelation kinetics, we modified the brine concentration between 0.35molL\u22121 and 0.65molL\u22121 while keeping a similar volume fraction \u03d5 = 5.9% of Ludox particles (assuming a density of \u03c1 = 1.3kgm\u22123 for the initial suspension, as indicated by the supplier) in the final gel.\nPhysico-chemical properties of Ludox silica colloidal suspensions are complex [60, 61] but can be qualitatively described by DLVO theory. In the initial suspension, the negative surface charge of particles induces a dominant electrostatic repulsion which stabilizes the solution. When mixed with brine, salts in solution screen this surface charge and attractive van der Waals interaction dominates the interaction potential, leading to a progressive agglomeration of colloids. A fractal network of particles forms and grows in time, giving elastic properties to the gel when it percolates across the sample. It is important to note that the obtained gels are physical and thus a priori distinct in microstructure and properties from the chemical gels obtained with the sol-gel process, which have already been studied by acoustic spectroscopy.\nBoth for acoustical and rheological measurements, the system is maintained at a constant temperature T = (23.0\u00b10.1)\u00b0C and the brine and Ludox suspensions are initially thermalized at the same temperature, in order to limit temperature transients. The two solutions are vigorously introduced in the measuring cell to favor an initial homogeneous mixing which sets the origin of time t = 0 in the experiments. The solution progressively turns into a gel, which can be visually observed by an increasing turbidity due to the growth of the colloidal network. The volume fraction of Ludox and concentration of the brine were chosen to keep a gelation time long enough to allow for loading and thermalization of the sample, while being short enough to ensure experiments run over less than one day."

Gelation is slow enough to allow for measurements at different frequencies: rheometer repeats over time seven steps of frequencies ranging from 0.1Hz to 1Hz.\n3"

Two piezoelectric immersion transducers (Olympus V312-SU, central frequency 10MHz, bandwidth 4\u221212MHz, diameter 6mm) were placed on both sides of the sample, in a small water tank in order to maximize acoustic transmission. One transducer is connected to a pulse generator (Sofranel DPR300) which generates short electrical impulses (duration around 0.5\u00b5s) with a tunable repetition rate in order to create acoustic pulses. Our setup allows for two different measurements: the emitting transducer can also be used as a receiver to measure reflected signals while the other transducer is used to acquire transmitted signals. The earlier was connected to an amplification and filtering stage included in the pulse generator, and both are eventually linked to an oscilloscope (Keysight InfiniiVision 2000X) triggered by the pulse generator for data acquisition and digitization. In order to improve the signal-noise ratio, measurements were averaged over ten pulses with a pulse repetition frequency of 1Hz to ensure a good separation between successive pulses while being significantly faster than the typical timescale of evolution of the gel.\nWe took great care to ensure the sample was kept under isothermal conditions to avoid any thermal bias. To this purpose, the sample was placed in a double-walled cell built in a resin by a SLA 3D printer (Formlabs, High Temp resin). The double wall allowed circulation of water whose temperature is imposed by a thermal bath driven by a feedback loop controlled by a platinum resistance thermometer (4 point PT100, Radiospares) plunged inside the sample. We managed to obtain temperature fluctuations below 0.1\u00b0C after typical thermalization transients of a few minutes.\nIn order to limit interfaces on the acoustic path, the cell wall was designed with a small opening on both sides which is closed by a polycarbonate window (in white on Fig. 1) of homogeneous thickness about 1mm, which was isotropic and homogeneous for ultrasound propagation.\nIn order to align the setup, the measurement cell was held by a ball joint on translation platforms in order to control both its orientation and position. First, the two transducers were aligned parallel and along the same axis by maximizing the amplitude of the transmitted signal. Then, the cell was placed in between and aligned with windows orthogonal to the acoustic propagation direction by maximizing the amplitude of the signal reflected by the first window."

More precisely, the beams generated by the transducers are axisymmetric and we assume that the transverse structure of the acoustic field is not significantly affected by the gelation inside the experimental cell. As we ultimately normalize measurement by a reference\npulse propagating in water, effects of this transverse structure factor out in our final results [62].\nThe acoustic pressure at position x and time t for a single freely propagating pulse can then be written as a wave packet:\nu(x, t) = \u222b\nu0f e j[k( f )x\u22122\u03c0 f t]d f \u2261 \u222b u f (x)e\u22122 j\u03c0 f td f (1)\nwhere u0f represents the spectral content of the source and u f is the Fourier transform of the signal. The wave vector k( f ) = k\u2032( f ) + jk\u2032\u2032( f ) is a complex number, which is set for a given frequency by the properties of the material through a dispersion relation. One defines the (frequencydependent) sound speed c f and attenuation coefficient \u03b1 f by setting k\u2032 = f/c f and k\u2032\u2032 = \u03b1 f . For the sake of simplicity, we will from now on drop the subscript f for speed and attenuation, that will be simply denoted by c and \u03b1: yet, one should keep in mind that these quantities depend on frequency. The Fourier transform of the wave packet can then be expressed as\nu f (x) = u0f e 2 j\u03c0 f x/ce\u2212\u03b1x. (2)\nFor propagation over a distance ` of a wave at frequency f , the time of flight is given by \u03c4 = `/c and the attenuation factor is e\u2212\u03b1`. With this definition, the attenuation \u03b1 is expressed in Neper per meter (Np/m).\nWhen a wave packet crosses an interface, it generates a transmitted and a reflected echo of proportional amplitudes, that later propagate towards the next interface. In our setup, the two transducers allowed us to record these successive echoes created by the initial pulse during its propagation in the water tank, in the windows of the cell and in the sample of interest. The time of flight and attenuation of these pulses were thus not only related to the sample, but also to the propagation in the whole setup: obtaining absolute measurements is not possible with our current experiment. We can however obtain relative values with respect to a reference medium, chosen as water because its acoustic properties are precisely known.\nThe calibration procedure is described in details in A. Shortly, we normalized our measurements by reference signals obtained by reflection on a cell filled with air (the air/window interface being perfectly reflecting for acoustic waves) and by reflection on and transmission through a cell filled with water. This allowed us to obtain the reflection and transmission coefficients of the various interfaces and to factor out the effects of propagation through other media. We finally obtained the excess time of flight and excess attenuation for the propagation across the length ` of sample, compared to the propagation across a similar length of water. As the length ` was also calibrated, and by using tabulated acoustic properties of water [63, 64], we could deduce the sound speed and attenuation of the sample."

            "text": "The evolution in time of the viscoelastic moduli G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 after mixing the brine and the colloidal suspension are presented in Fig. 2, for different brine concentrations and similar particle volume fraction. They are reported here at a single frequency of 1Hz but our measurements showed no notable difference between the different probed frequencies. The overall evolution is consistent with results reported by Cao et al. [58]. Initially, both moduli are very small and at the limit of resolution of the rheometer. After a time delay \u03c4d, they suddenly rise, and eventually increase more progressively as the gel ages. For some samples, we observed sudden drops of the elastic modulus when the system was gelified: we suspect that this is due to wall slip events, despite the walls of the geometry were sandblasted. As they happen after gelation, these events do not affect our measurements of gelation time. Moreover, as it is more directly related to acoustic attenuation, we will mostly focus on measurements obtained from the viscous modulus G\u2032\u2032 that does not display these drops.\nIn order to check for reproducibility, we repeated some of the formulations: despite some variability in the absolute values of the moduli (particularly visible on their final values), there is still a clear difference of dynamics when varying the amount of salt in the system, more concentrated brine leading to faster gelation. However, it is to note that the least concentrated sample (for [NaCl] = 0.35molL\u22121) hardly started to gelify at the end of the experiment: it is thus dubious to interpret results for this gel. We will present our measurement for\nthis gel on figures, but it will be excluded for fittings. Similar caution will be taken with acoustic measurements.\nDifferent ways exist to define a gelation time from rheological measurements. For all the different definitions presented in the following, the relative variation of gelation time obtained when reproducing the experiment in the same conditions is about 10%, which is taken as the associated uncertainty.\nThe most rigorous definition is given by the Winter criterion: by analyzing the evolution in time of the viscoelastic moduli at different frequencies, the gelation time \u03c4W can be defined as the time at which the loss angle tan\u03b4 = G\u2032\u2032/G\u2032 is independent of frequency. This criterion was justified by theoretical arguments on the behavior of viscous and elastic moduli when approaching the critical point of percolation [65\u201369]. While being initially introduced for chemical gels forming by reticulation, this criterion has also been successfully applied to physical silica gels [59, 70]. The time defined from Winter criterion also coincides approximately with the time at which the elastic modulus G\u2032 overcomes the viscous one G\u2032\u2032 [71, 72], which is a more intuitive and common definition. It is interesting to note that applying this latter definition would allow to define a frequency-dependent gelation time but our rheological measurements showed almost no effect of frequency on the probed range.\nMeasurements by Cao et al. [58] showed that gelation time obtained from Winter criterion evolves exponentially with concentration [NaCl] along:\n\u03c4 = \u03c40e\u2212\u03ba[NaCl] (3)\nwith \u03balitt = (8.3\u00b1 1.2)Lmol\u22121 for gels similar to the one we study (in particular with similar volume fraction of par-\nticles). The times obtained from Winter criterion for different brine concentrations are plotted on Fig. 3(a). They follow this exponential evolution, with \u03c40,W ' 3.6\u00d7105 s and \u03baW = (8.5\u00b10.5)Lmol\u22121. We observe that the coefficient \u03ba we obtain is in quantitative agreement with the value obtained in the literature.\nWinter criterion is not very convenient to use. First, it was difficult with some samples to observe a clear crossing of the tan\u03b4 curves at different frequencies. Moreover, these measurements are long to perform as they require to be made at different frequencies. It is thus interesting to define gelation times by other means.\nA simple criterion is obtained by measuring the delay time \u03c4d at which the viscoelastic moduli start rising: the obtained results are displayed on Fig. 3(b). We observe that the times obtained by analyzing the elastic and viscous moduli are similar: consequently, we will mostly focus on the times obtained from G\u2032\u2032, as they are more likely to be correlated with the acoustic attenuation that will be exploited in section III B. This time also follows an exponential evolution with concentration (3), with a typical time \u03c40,d ' 1.1\u00d7106 s and concentration \u03bad = (10.4\u00b10.5)Lmol\u22121. This value of \u03ba is close to this obtained from Winter criterion, suggesting that the delay time is also a good marker of gelation.\nWe also tested other ways to define a gelation time, by measuring a rising time at 63% of the final value and by fitting viscoelastic moduli with a stretched exponential, as suggested by Cao et al. [58] for the elastic modulus. In all cases, we obtain comparable times from studies of G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032, independent on frequency, and displaying an exponential variation with brine concentration along Eq. (3) with similar values of \u03ba .\nIn the following, we will rather discuss the time observed from Winter criterion. However, the fact that the other proposed definition give qualitatively similar results makes us confident in the quality of our measurements of gelation time."

            "text": "As a first step, we want to compare the gelation dynamics probed by ultrasound spectroscopy to this obtained in rheology. To do so, we decided to focus on a simple analysis of acoustic data and consider only the averaged sound speed c and attenuation \u03b1 on the whole frequency range. Information is obviously lost in the process and we will check in Section IV that it still makes sense, but this approach is interesting from an engineering point of view, as it provides us with a simple method to monitor gelation. We thus reproduced the same formulations studied with the rheometer and monitored their gelation with the acoustic setup presented in Section II C. An example of evolution of average sound speed c and attenuation \u03b1 is displayed on Fig. 4. In some samples, initial few minutes were removed from analysis because of transient thermalization of the sample.\nWe observe that sound speed does not vary significantly over the duration of the experiment. This is probably due to the fact that it is dominated by the solvent compressibility, which does not evolve during gelation. The tiny remaining evolution (overall increase observed in this example) is not reproducible from one experiment to another and probably reflects some very local changes in the gel. We consequently will not exploit data from sound speed in the following. On the contrary, the attenuation displays a reproducible and progressive increase during the gelation process.\nThis evolution for the samples of different brine concentrations is plotted on Fig. 5. Despite some variability, attenuation overall increases in time and dynamics is faster for higher brine concentrations: this qualitative observation is consistent with the aforementioned literature on Ludox gels [56\u201358] and our own rheological measurements of III A. This is also consistent with the fact that acoustic attenuation is somehow related to dissipation in the material, thus to the viscous modulus G\u2032\u2032. As in our rheological experiments, the sample at brine concentration [NaCl] = 0.35molL\u22121 did not fully gelify over the duration of the experiment: we will display the associated\nresult but exclude it from further analysis. In order to compare our results with rheometrical characterization, we need to define a typical gelation time \u03c4US from the acoustic measurements. Here, there is no apparent delay in the evolution of \u03b1 and noise in our data makes difficult to obtain a robust rising time. We propose to fit the evolution by a generic exponential function:\n\u03b1(t) = \u03b10 +\u2206\u03b1 ( 1\u2212 e\u2212t/\u03c4US ) .

When\nreproducing the experiment with samples of similar composition, typical relative variations of \u03c4US are of about 20%.\nThe evolution of gelation time again follows an exponential evolution with brine concentration, given by Eq.

It is interesting to note that gelation time obtained from Winter criterion, which relies on a microscopic description of the gel structure, is of the same order of magnitude as the acoustic gelation time. Moreover, the mechanical solicitation of the rheometer is pure shear while the acoustic excitation also involves compression. Finally, even if shear amplitude in the rheometer is kept as small as possible, it is likely to slightly delay the gelation process [73\u201375] while ultrasound amplitude is too small to have a significant impact [76].\nThis good correlation of gelation times opens the way to a purely acoustic monitoring of gelation, of interest in industrial context as it is a non-invasive method that can easily be adapted to inline processes. In particular, there is no need for modeling of the acoustic attenuation as we used a very generic exponential fitting. It is also interesting to note that using focused transducers would allow to characterize smaller volumes of material.\nIn our setup, we took great care to ensure strict isothermal conditions, which would be a major shortcoming for practical applications. However, this was required in order to minimize thermal biases for validation of the method. While sound speed is known to depend strongly on temperature, acoustic attenuation is only mildly affected by temperature fluctuations and a qualitative monitoring of gelation does not require the strict temperature control we employed in this experiment."

As discussed in the introduction, the gelation process of destabilization of a suspension through electrostatic screening is known to create more heterogeneous structures than the sol-gel process that has already been studied in the literature. It is thus important to check the degree of heterogeneity in the gels we study to validate our conclusions.\nHowever, the cell presented in section II C 1 had only a small window (in order to ensure temperature control) which did not allow for scanning a representative field of the sample. We thus needed to change the measurement cell. We formulated gels in a cell culture flask (which has the interest to offer large, flat and homogeneous sides), sealed with Parafilm to limit drying, and left them to age for about 10h in order to reach a stationary state. With this system, we could not control the temperature of the sample anymore: the flask was in a water bath to ensure acoustic propagation, but it was affected by room temperature fluctuations. Moreover, when moving the cell vertically, it was partially withdrawn from the water bath which could induce temperature changes.\nWe scanned a field of 1.4cm in height and 3.2cm in width, by steps of 1mm corresponding to a map of about 450 points. These steps are small compared to the size of the acoustic beam (of radius of about 3mm): there is thus a correlation between successive points. Such a measurement takes about 2h, hence the requirement to wait for a long enough time for the gel to be in a stationary state at this timescale. The cell was moved in successive vertical columns in order to limit the possible apparition of a vertical temperature gradient due to the partial withdrawal of the cell from the bath. Resulting maps of average acoustic speed and attenuation for a sample are displayed on Fig. 7.\nFirst, we observe an apparent lateral gradient of acoustic velocity. This is most probably due to room temperature variations which are likely on the time scale of the experiment, as there is no reason to observe such a smooth gradient orthogonal to gravity. Temperature has however a smaller impact on acoustic attenuation, as can be seen by the absence of overall tendency in acoustic maps: we can consequently still exploit these, at least qualitatively.\nThe result presented in Fig. 7(b) is representative of the different samples. The gel display some spots with higher attenuation in a rather homogeneous background. Without further study, it is uneasy to determine the cause of these heterogeneities: they could for instance be due to intrinsical heterogeneity of the gelation process, to imperfect initial mixing of the solutions or to the possible trapping of air bubbles. They could explain the variability of absolute values of attenuation from sample to sample. However, this does not compromise our comparative results of samples at different concentrations. These heterogeneities are indeed localized and outside of these zones, attenuation is rather homogeneous: the relative standard deviation of attenuation is there (\u03c3\u03b1/\u3008\u03b1\u3009) ' 10%. Consequently, provided that the acoustic path crosses an homogeneous part of the sample, these fluctu-\nations remain small enough to discriminate between the different concentrations on Fig. 5."

However, such an averaging over the bandwidth of the pulses loses information on the system and detailed analysis of acoustic spectra should provide further information. In this paragraph, we study these spectra and attempt to model them, in order to relate acoustic measurements with more physical parameters of the material. An example of the evolution of the acoustic spectra is presented in Fig. 8. An alternative representation can be obtained with colormaps in the time-frequency plane, as presented in Fig. 9.\nWe observe that there is no significant acoustic dispersion in the gel as the sound speed spectrum remains essentially flat over the whole transformation, in agreement with the idea that it is principally determined by water. However, the acoustic attenuation increases with frequency. As this evolution is monotonous, the average value remains a meaningful parameter to describe attenuation, which justifies the averaged approach, but more information could be obtained by further analysis."

In order to rewrite these acoustic quantities in more mechanical terms, it is possible to define an elastic acoustic modulus along:\nE \u2032 = \u03c1 f 2c2 f 2\u2212 (\u03b1c)2\n[ f 2 +(\u03b1c)2]2 ' \u03b1c f \u03c1c2, (5)\nand a viscous elastic modulus along:\nE \u2032\u2032 = 2\u03c1 f 3c2 \u03b1c\n[ f 2 +(\u03b1c)2]2 ' \u03b1c f 2\u03c1c2 \u00b7 \u03b1c f . (6)\nModuli E \u2032 and E \u2032\u2032 are the analogous for acoustic propagation of the viscoelastic moduli G\u2032 and G\u2032\u2032 in rheology, but they\nare associated with different types and frequencies of excitation [77]. In our experiments, we have \u03b1c f over the whole frequency range so the first order expansions in Eqs. (5) and (6) are valid. An example of the evolution of these moduli with time at different frequencies are displayed on Fig. 10.\nAs can be seen from the approximation in Eq. (5), the elastic modulus E \u2032 is essentially related to sound speed, thus has only little dependency in frequency and does not vary significantly in time, the observed slight variation being not reproducible. The obtained value of E \u2032 ' 2GPa corresponds roughly to this of water which is not surprising because elastic shear modulus of the gel is negligible compared to water bulk compressibility. On the contrary, the viscous modulus E \u2032\u2032, which is mostly determined by sound attenuation both increases with time and frequency.\nFollowing a similar empirical approach to this used with the average attenuation in III B, we can fit the time evolution of the viscous modulus E \u2032\u2032 at every frequency with an exponential:\nE \u2032\u2032(t) = E0 +\u2206E ( 1\u2212 e\u2212t/\u03c4 ) . (7)\nWe thus define for every frequency a characteristic time \u03c4 , as well as initial elastic modulus E0 and variation amplitude \u2206E.\nThe evolution of these parameters with frequency are plotted on Fig. 11. We keep the discussion of parameters E0 and \u2206E for Section IV C. We observe that the characteristic time \u03c4 decreases with frequency. The results for the different samples, with varying brine concentration, are gathered on Fig. 12. It is uneasy to draw general conclusions from these measurements. In agreement with the results on averaged attenuation, we observe that more concentrated brines lead to faster gelation at most frequencies, despite some sample to sample variability. Some inversions can be observed below 7MHz but this corresponds to frequencies where signal to noise ratio is not very large and we do not consider these as significant. For the least concentrated samples, \u03c4 shows a trend to increase with frequency, while it decreases for the most concentrated samples: this calls for a more systematic investigation. However, in all cases (except for the most concentrated samples), variations with frequency are not negligible while they were hidden in the averaged approach.\nWe observe that at every frequency, the characteristic time still evolves exponentially with concentration, following a generalization of Eq. (3) with:\n\u03c4( f , [NaCl]) = \u03c40( f )e\u2212\u03c7( f )[NaCl]. (8)\nc (m s\u22121)\n\u03b1 (Np/m)(a) (b)\nThe inset of Fig. 13 shows an example of exponential fit. Again, data corresponding at brine concentration [NaCl]\nwhich did not fully gelify are displayed but excluded from fits. The evolution of parameters \u03c40 and \u03c7 are plotted on Fig. 13.\n10\nWe observe that the characteristic inverse concentration \u03c7 increases with frequency while characteristic time \u03c40 decreases. The value of \u03c7 is comparable to this of parameter \u03baUS obtained with averaged attenuation. The opposite variations of \u03c7 and \u03c40 is associated to a peculiarity observable on Fig. 12: at low brine concentration, the gelation time \u03c4 tends to increase with frequency, while it decreases at high brine concentration. For a concentration around [NaCl]' 0.55molL\u22121, there is only little effect of frequency on the gelation time."

It however remains empirical and it is interesting to attempt to model more precisely the acoustic spectra. Defining a precise model for acoustic propagation in colloidal gels is out of the scope of our present work, however one can follow a more phenomenological path.\n11\nSound attenuation in a viscoelastic medium can be shown to be quadratic in frequency following [77, 78]:\n\u03b1 = \u03b7tot f 2\n2\u03c1c3 = \u03b7tot 2 \u221a \u03c1 E3 f 2 (9)\nwhere \u03c1 is the density of the material, E is the elastic compressibility modulus, c = \u221a E/\u03c1 the speed of sound and \u03b7tot = \u03b7b + 4\u03b7/3 corresponds to viscous dissipation, due to both regular shear viscosity \u03b7 and second viscosity \u03b7b associated with compressibility effects. We thus focus on the rescaled attenuation \u03d5( f ) = \u03b1/ f 2\nAn example of the variations of \u03d5 with frequency is plotted on Fig. 14(a). While this rescaling dampens a significant part of the variations, we still keep a trend of decreasing \u03d5 . Such variations could be due to relaxation phenomena resulting from the interaction between the acoustic wave and the rigid skeleton of the gel. If we assume this relaxation is governed by a single time scale \u03b8 , the attenuation should become [6, 79\u201381]:\n\u03b1 = A f 2 +B f 2\n1+( f \u03b8)2 (10)\nwhich corresponds to a lorentzian profile of \u03d5( f ). A direct fit of attenuation \u03b1 (or rescaled attenuation \u03d5) with Eq. (10) was not numerically stable. In order to simplify the analysis, we decided to set the value of A to the reference value A0 = 5.47\u00d710\u221216 Np/m for water [6, 64]. We can then adjust as an affine function of f 2 the parameter \u03a8 defined by:\n\u03a8 = 1\n(\u03b1/ f 2)\u2212A0 = 1 B\n[ 1+(\u03b8 f )2 ] (11)\nExamples of such fit for a given sample are plotted on Fig. 14(b). It is interesting to note that parameter \u03a8 is actually related to the excess attenuation with respect to water which is directly measured in our experiment.\nBy fitting spectra during gelation, we obtained timedependent parameters B and \u03b8 . The evolution of the relaxation timescale \u03b8 is represented as a function of time for the different brine concentrations on Fig. 15(b). We observe that despite some important fluctuations, its evolution shows no significant trend in time. The average relaxation time \u03b8 also shows no clear trend with the brine concentration, as illustrated on Fig. 16. This suggests that \u03b8 is associated to local gel structure rather than being a general feature of the material.\nConversely, as can be seen on Fig. 15(a), parameter B which quantifies the amplitude of the relaxation increases significantly in time and can be modeled by an exponential along:\nB(t) = B0 +\u2206B ( 1\u2212 e\u2212t/\u03c4r ) . (12)\nSuch a fit allows to define for all gel an initial value B0 and an amplitude variation \u2206B as well as a characteristic time \u03c4r, that are plotted versus brine concentration on Fig. 17.\nAs can be seen on Fig. 17(a), parameters B0 and \u2206B show no specific trend with brine concentration and seem\nto be rather random parameters, specific to a given gel. The timescale \u03c4r that quantifies the gelation dynamics has a trend of decreasing with brine concentration, as pictured on Fig. 17(b). Even if the result is less convincing than with the previously defined times, one can still adjust these variations with an exponential along:\n\u03c4r = \u03c40,re\u2212\u03c7r[NaCl] (13)\nWe obtain a typical inverse concentration \u03c7r = (4.1\u00b10.5)Lmol\u22121 which is notably smaller than the previous values, but remains of the same order of magnitude.\nOther models for attenuation spectrum than the proposed relaxation (10) exist. For instance, a powerlaw attenuation \u03b1 = \u03b10 f \u03b3 corresponding to a fractional Kelvin-Voigt model [82, 83]) also provides us with an acceptable description of the spectra, but the evolution in time of the resulting parameters \u03b10 and \u03b3 show a poor reproducibility. At this stage, it is thus not possible to draw clear conclusions about the acoustic spectra. These results therefore remain preliminary and improved experimental data would be helpful, in particular with an extended frequency range to better constrain fits."

We more precisely studied the gelation of colloidal silica due\nto the mixing with a concentrated brine, which is a model system for physical gelation but had not been studied with acoustic techniques previously. In this system, it has been shown in the literature that the brine concentration allows to control the gelation dynamics. We showed that while sound speed remains almost constant, essentially corresponding to its value in water, acoustic attenuation increases in time.\nIn a first step, we only considered average attenuation. It allowed us to define a gelation time, that compares satisfactorily with common rheological measurements. This shows the interest of acoustic spectroscopy for monitoring of dynamical processes, as such a setup can easily be adapted to industrial contexts. Moreover, we showed that our setup is capable of mapping spatially the acoustic properties of the gel, and reveals heterogeneities of the gel structure.\nThen, we proposed a more careful study of the acoustic spectra. Our measurement first show that overall, acoustic at-\n13\ntenuation increases in time at all frequencies and with increasing brine concentration. As a first approach, fitting acoustic moduli as a function of time, frequency per frequency, allows to characterize the frequency-dependent gelation dynamics, while remaining in agreement with the overall trends observed with the average approach. Then, we used a more physical description of acoustic spectra using a single timescale relaxation model, that also allows to characterize the gelation dynamics. These two points of view can be compared: some incompatibilities exist with our current data, but lack of statistics makes difficult to clearly decide the best approach. Our work however gives a good description of attenuation spectra of physical colloidal gels.\nThe current study would require more experiments to perform more precise statistics, and an improved setup to access a wider frequency range.

We finally denote by ` the cell thickness.\nBy writing the phase and attenuation due to propagation and the coefficients associated with reflection and transmission through interfaces for the different signals, and by assuming that the interface between the polycarbonate window and air is an ideal reflector (rPC/a = 1), we can calibrate the experiment and retrieve the quantities we are interested in. First,\nby considering the ratio between the reflection on air and on the sample, and on air and on water, we respectively obtain the reflection coefficients on the window:\nrw/PC = uw,r ua,r and rs/PC = us,r ua,r . (A1)\nFrom these coefficients, we can also easily deduce the associated transmission coefficients. Knowing these factors, the excess attenuation and time of flight in sample with respect to water can obtained by normalizing the transmitted signal through the sample and through the water:\n\u03b1s\u2212\u03b1w = 1 ` ln \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 1\u2212 r2s/PC1\u2212 r2w/PC uw,tus,t \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 (A2)\nand:\n` cs \u2212 ` cw =\n1 2\u03c0 f arg [\n1\u2212r2s/PC 1\u2212r2w/PC\n] [arg( us,t uw,t ) +2q\u03c0 ] (A3)\nwhere q is an integer. This parameter is due to the fact that the phase is known modulo 2\u03c0 . In order to measure it, we unwrap the phase of us,t/uw,t which is almost linear with frequency, and extrapolate it at null frequency, giving a value \u2212A. The physical phase difference between the two signals should cancel in this limit, so we take q as the floor of A.\nAttenuation \u03b1w and sound speed cw in water are taken from reference values [63, 64]. Finally, ` is obtained by measuring the difference of time of flight for a cell filled with water between the reflection at the first window/water interface (corresponding to signal uw,r) and at the water/second window interface.\n[1] J.
