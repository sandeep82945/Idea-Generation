1. **Investigate the effects of different biochar feedstocks and pyrolysis conditions on the negative impact of biochar on microorganisms in anaerobic digestion.** This could involve studying the effects of different feedstocks, such as agricultural residues, forestry waste, and municipal solid waste, as well as different pyrolysis temperatures and heating rates, on the properties of biochar and its impact on microbial activity and biogas production.


2. **Explore the use of alternative carbon materials, such as hydrochar and activated carbon, as additives in anaerobic digestion to mitigate the negative effects of biochar.** This could involve comparing the effects of different carbon materials on microbial activity, biogas production, and the stability of the anaerobic digestion process.


3. **Investigate the mechanisms by which biochar and other carbon materials can negatively impact microorganisms in anaerobic digestion.** This could involve studying the effects of biochar on microbial cell structure, enzyme activity, and gene expression, as well as the interactions between biochar and microorganisms.


4. **Develop strategies to mitigate the negative effects of biochar and other carbon materials on microorganisms in anaerobic digestion.** This could involve optimizing the dosage of biochar or other carbon materials, modifying the properties of biochar through pre-treatment or blending with other materials, or using alternative additives to improve the performance of anaerobic digestion systems.


5. **Conduct long-term studies to assess the sustainability of using biochar and other carbon materials as additives in anaerobic digestion.** This could involve monitoring the performance of anaerobic digestion systems over time, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of using biochar and other carbon materials.
