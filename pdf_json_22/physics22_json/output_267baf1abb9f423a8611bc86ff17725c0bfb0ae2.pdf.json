Stern-Gerlach experiments in the macroscopic domain are needed to settle this question.\nKeywords: Stern-Gerlach experiment, Schro\u0308dinger-Newton equation, Self-gravitational interaction, Semiclassical gravity, emergence of classicality.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nDespite its enormous success, quantum theory still has certain unresolved problems, one of which is the emergence of classicality [1, 2]. Quantum theory characteristically involves superpositions of states, which are entirely absent in the classical world. If one believes that quantum theory is fundamental, it should lead to the classical world in some limit. Quantum theory in itself provides no mechanism for the emergence of classicality.\nConsider the Stern-Gerlach experiment (see Fig. 1), a prototype example of a quantum measurement [3], and one that bears the distinction of demonstrating the fundamentally quantum nature of spin. A spin-1/2 particle subject to a magnetic field gradient experiences a potential proportional to the component of the spin along the magnetic field direction. A general quantum state of a spin-1/2 particle is a superposition cos \u03b82 |\u2191\u3009+ sin \u03b8 2 |\u2193\u3009 in the spin-z basis.In a magnetic field gradient, the trajectory of this particle splits into two, and it always lands in one of two spots on the screen. This general state is also an eigenstate of S\u0302\u03b8 = ~S \u00b7 n\u0302, the spin component along the direction n\u0302 at an angle \u03b8 to the z-axis. Classically this would represent an angular momentum vector pointing along n\u0302. The force on the classical magnetic moment in a field gradient is proportional to cos \u03b8, so that the particle follows a single trajectory landing on the screen somewhere between the spots corresponding to the spin states |\u2191\u3009 (\u03b8 = 0) and |\u2193\u3009 (\u03b8 = \u03c0), with a continuous set of possibilities. The question then is whether this classical behaviour can emerge from quantum dynamics if the\n\u2217 sourav.sahoo1490@gmail.com. \u2020 radhika@goa.bits-pilani.ac.in \u2021 tabish@ctp-jamia.res.in\nparticle is massive enough. To our knowledge a SternGerlach experiment with macroscopic particles has not yet been performed, and whether it would lead to the classical result remains unverified.\nA major contender among theories for the emergence of classicality is decoherence[1, 2], which emphasizes the unavoidable role played by the environment in the evolution of a quantum system. Examining the experiment in the context of decoherence, the initial superposition of pure spin states evolves into a mixed state, which is an incoherent superposition of the two trajectories corresponding to those of |\u2191\u3009 and |\u2193\u3009 [4]. This predicts that the particle will still land in one of the two spots on the screen corresponding to |\u2191\u3009 and |\u2193\u3009. Decoherence does not lead to any intermediate trajectory corresponding to the classically expected behaviour of a particle with magnetic moment passing through a Stern-Gerlach setup.\nWe wish to emphasize here that in various other ex-\nar X\niv :2\n21 1.\n08 36\n3v 3\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n3 1\nJa n\n20 23\n2 periments, such as a massive particle passing through a double-slit, decoherence leads to suppression of superpositions of the two alternate paths, and classically expected behavior emerges. In the Stern Gerlach experiment, from classical dynamics one would expect a single outcome corresponding to the z-component of the magnetic moment. However, such an outcome is not explained by decoherence or by the collapse postulate, both of which lead to the emergence of one of the spin eigenvalues with probabilities predicted by the Born rule.\nFollowing Roger Penrose\u2019s proposal [5] that gravity could play a role in the emergence of classicality in massive particles, several authors have investigated the effect of gravity on quantum systems in various ways [6\u201310]. Here we explore the role of self-gravity of a massive particle in the emergence of classicality in a Stern-Gerlach experiment, using the Schro\u0308dinger-Newton (S-N) equation, earlier introduced by Dio\u0301si [11]."

In this approach, quantized matter is assumed to be coupled to the classical gravitational field [14\u201316], and the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor with respect to the quantum state |\u03a8\u3009 of matter is the source in the Einstein field equations:\nG\u00b5\u03bd = 8\u03c0G c4 \u3008\u03a8|T\u0302\u00b5\u03bd |\u03a8\u3009.

Since this potential depends on the wavefunction itself, the S-N equation is a non-linear modification of the Schro\u0308dinger equation. The non-linearity breaks the unitarity of Schro\u0308dinger evolution, and opens up the potentialities of effects that were precluded by the linearity of quantum dynamics, including perhaps a dynamical reduction of the wavefunction. Issues caused by the sacrosanct quantum-mechanical linearity being broken have been debated in the literature [20]. However,\nthe hope behind this approach is that the dynamics will be linear for all practical purposes at the scales at which quantum mechanics has been successfully tested, and the non-linearity will show up only when one approaches the classical limit. There have also been several other approaches in which non-linearity has been introduced in order to obtain wave-function collapse [21\u201323]. The S-N equation, however, is elegant because no adjustable parameters are introduced, and it should naturally lead to the scale at which classicality might emerge."

            "text": "Consider a Stern-Gerlach experiment as shown in Fig. 1, in which a spin-1/2 particle of mass m travels along the x axis, experiencing a magnetic field along the z axis, with a constant gradient B0z\u0302 [24]. If we assume that the spin-1/2 magnetic moment ~\u00b5 is due to a single unpaired electron in the particle, then the potential experienced by the particle is given by\nVB(z) = \u2212~\u00b5 \u00b7 ~B = \u2212\u00b5BB0z\u03c3z, (4)\nwhere \u00b5B is the Bohr magneton, and \u03c3z is the Pauli spin-z operator. This potential causes a spin-dependent deviation along the z-direction. Assuming an initial constant velocity vx\u0302, the dynamics of the particle along the x-axis is trivial, just translating the x-position of the particle by x = vt in a given time t. So we do not consider the motion of the particle along the x axis explicitly, and just focus on its dynamics along the z axis. The quantum dynamics of the particle in the z direction is given by the one-dimensional Schro\u0308dinger equation under the influence of the potential VB(z) of Eq. (4).\nImposing the additional self-gravitational potential given by Eq. (3), the effective dynamics in the z direction is governed by the S-N equation reduced to one dimension[25], along with VB(z):(\np2z 2m + VG(z) + VB(z)\n) \u03a8(z, t) = i~\u2202\u03a8(z, t)\n\u2202t , (5)\nwith VG(z) = \u2212Gm2 \u222b |\u03a8(z\u2032,t)|2 |z\u2212z\u2032| dz\n\u2032. The state of the particle in general is given by a spinor |\u03a8\u3009, which in the position basis, is a two-component wave-function in a superposition of spin-up and spin-down states:\n\u3008z|\u03a8(t)\u3009 = \u03c7+(z, t)|\u2191\u3009+ \u03c7\u2212(z, t)|\u2193\u3009.\nThe position-space probability distribution of the particle required to calculate the gravitational potential is given by\n|\u03a8(z, t)|2 = | \u3008z|\u03a8\u3009 |2\n= |\u03c7+(z, t)|2 + |\u03c7\u2212(z, t)|2, (6)\nwhere the cross terms between \u03c7\u00b1(z, t) vanish due to the orthogonality of |\u2191\u3009 and |\u2193\u3009. Using Eq. (3), the\n3 self-gravitational potential becomes VG(\u03a8) = VG(\u03c7+) + VG(\u03c7\u2212), where VG(\u03c7\u00b1) = \u2212Gm2 \u222b |\u03c7\u00b1(z\u2032,t)|2 |z\u2212z\u2032| dz\n\u2032. The SN equation for our system can now be expressed as[ \u2212 ~ 2\n2m\u2202 2 z + VG \u2212 \u03b3z 0\n0 \u2212 ~ 2 2m\u2202 2 z + VG + \u03b3z\n] [ \u03c7+ \u03c7\u2212 ] = i~ [ \u03c7\u0307+ \u03c7\u0307\u2212 ] .\n(7) This represents two equations for the time evolution of the two components \u03c7\u00b1, that are coupled nonlinear equations since the potential term VG depends on both \u03c7+ and \u03c7\u2212. Here \u03b3 = \u00b5BB0 represents the magnetic force in our model. Introducing a length scale \u03c3r in terms of which time and mass scales are defined as\ntr = ( \u03c35r G~ ) 1 3 , mr = ( ~2\nG\u03c3r\n) 1 3\n, (8)\nwe work in terms of the dimensionless variables\nz\u0303 = z/\u03c3r, m\u0303 = m/mr , t\u0303 = t/tr ,\nand rescaled wavefunctions \u03c8\u0303 = \u221a\u03c3r\u03c8, \u03c7\u0303\u00b1 = \u221a \u03c3r\u03c7\u00b1. The dimensionless magnetic force is\n\u03b3\u0303 = \u03b3 mr\u03c3r/t2r = \u00b5BB0 mr\u03c3r/t2r . (9)\nEq.

We have carried out comprehensive numerical simulations of the problem to avoid being constrained by the limits of analytical approximations. We used the Crank-Nicolson method [27, 28] to solve Eqns (10), with spatial and temporal grid sizes chosen as \u2206z\u0303 = 0.05 and \u2206t\u0303 = 0.01 respectively, which satisfy the CFL (Courant\u2013Friedrichs\u2013Lewy) condition for stability of the solutions: \u2206t\u0303\u2206z\u0303 < 1. To tackle the singularity in the self-gravity potential, we regularize the integral in the potential using a small dimensionless \u03b4: \u2212m2 \u222b \u03c7\u0303\u00b1(z\u0303\u2032,t\u0303)|2\u221a |z\u0303\u2212z\u0303\u2032|2+\u03b42\ndz\u2032. \u03b4 was fixed at 0.01. Fixing the spatial boundaries at \u00b1100 avoided boundary effects.\nThe initial state of the particle was a Gaussian wavepacket of half width , localized at z\u0303 = 0, with the spin state in a general superposition cos \u03b82 |\u2191\u3009+sin \u03b8 2 |\u2193\u3009, so that\n\u03c7\u0303+(z\u0303, 0) = cos \u03b82 e\u2212z\u0303\n2/2 2\n\u221a \u03c0\n, \u03c7\u0303\u2212(z\u0303, 0) = sin \u03b82 e\u2212z\u0303\n2/2 2\n\u221a \u03c0 .\nFIG. 2.

A contour plot of |\u03a8\u0303(z\u0303, t\u0303)|2 as it evolves in time is shown in Fig. 3. Comparing with the trajectories of the peaks of the spin-up and spin-down wavepackets under pure Schro\u0308dinger dynamics (shown overlaid in blue), it is evident that for low enough mass, the presence of self-gravity does little to affect the pure quantum dynamics, and quantum superpositions remain unaffected.\nAs we increase the mass, the trajectories of the peaks of the wave-packets begin to deviate from those corresponding to pure Schro\u0308dinger dynamics.

The split between the spin-up and spin-down parts of the wavefunction is less than that without gravity, which is expected due to the gravitational attraction between the two components.

            "text": "Our results indicate that self-gravity could play a role in the emergence of classicality in a spin measurement experiment. As the mass of the particle is increased, the expected deviations of the peaks of the spin-up and spindown wavepackets are less than for the pure quantum evolution, and for high enough mass the two wavepackets do not separate, but instead travel as one wavepacket along the classically expected path. This behaviour does not emerge in the decoherence picture. Neither does it emerge in the many worlds interpretation [30]. In the latter, the two wave-packets with different spins, in the superposition state are believed to exist in two independent worlds. In each world, the particle is localized in position and has a distinct value of the z component of the spin. The classically expected path of the particle is nowhere in the picture in this interpretation. The SN model thus appears to fare better than other popular candidates for emergence of classicality that do not invoke wave-function collapse. However, it should be mentioned that it is not clear if the S-N equation can explain the collapse of a superposition of two distinct states to one of the states, with the probability governed by Born rule. There have been suggestions that the S-N equation may need stochastic modifications to achieve that [31]. It has also been pointed out that in the case of two spinentangled particles, and one of them passing through a Stern-Gerlach setup, the S-N equation leads to a possibility, at least in principle, of faster-than-light signalling\n[16]. The question remains as to whether nature actually shows the classically expected path in a Stern-Gerlach experiment with massive particles. Magnetic experiments have been carried out with large atomic clusters, and nano-size particles [32, 33]. However, in such experiments the magnetic moment of the atomic cluster is also large, and the space quantization may not be apparent. The experiment has to be performed with spin-1/2 particles in the macroscopic domain. Coming up with large particles with small, stable magnetic moments may be challenging as spin relaxation is often observed in such situations [34].\nOur results indicate that the effects of self-gravity in the Stern-Gerlach experiment are visible for m\u0303 \u223c 0.3 onward, on evolution upto t\u0303 \u223c 10. Choice of \u03c3r is guided by Eqn (8) and experimentally feasible masses. The smaller \u03c3r is, the larger the mass for which the effect of selfgravity will be noticeable over a relatively short time evolution. Eqn. (9) gives the required magnetic field gradient. For example, choosing \u03c3r = 0.371 nm leads us to mr = 46.05 \u00d7 109 u and tr = 0.1 s. This implies that a particle of mass 27.63 \u00d7 109 u (m\u0303 = 0.6), passing through a magnetic field gradient of 28 mT/m, will display the emergence classical behavior by time t = 1 s (t\u0303 = 10). These values appear well within the reach of the state-of-the-art technology. Magnetic field gradients up to 80 mT/m can already be achieved in clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners [35].\nThis experiment will be orders of magnitude less challenging than the Stern-Gerlach-like experiments proposed in the context of gravity induced entanglement, where masses of the order of 6 \u00d7 1012 u and magnetic field gradients of the order of 106 T/m are needed [36]. Stern-Gerlach experiments for testing the emergence of classicality have an advantage over interference experiments [25] in that one need not worry about creating and maintaining coherent superpositions of massive particles. The only challenge, we believe, would be in coming up with a particle of such high mass, but having a spin-1/2. Our simulations show that masses lower than about 5\u00d7 109 u will not show any effect of self-gravity in a Stern-Gerlach experiment."

            "text": "Including semiclassical gravitational self-interaction in the Schro\u0308dinger equation yields the interesting outcome of emergence of classicality for high masses in the SternGerlach experiment. This is a feature that is amenable to testing in the laboratory, subject to the feasibility of creating spin-1/2 particles of high enough mass. The question which needs to be settled is whether nature shows the expected classical outcome for large mass particles, or does spin remain quantized all the way to the classical regime. It is not clear if the emergence of a single outcome corresponding to the average spin in a\n6 Stern-Gerlach experiment can be explained by any linear theory. Thus this experiment may turn out to be a crucial one in deciding the survival of nonlinear theories like the S-N equation. If the experiments show that for large masses the classically expected result is recovered, it would indicate that there is something lacking in the linear quantum mechanics, including the ideas of decoherence and the many worlds interpretation.\nWe believe this experimental test should be easier to implement compared to the interference experiments which are being attempted on the mesoscopic scale [37\u2013 39]."
