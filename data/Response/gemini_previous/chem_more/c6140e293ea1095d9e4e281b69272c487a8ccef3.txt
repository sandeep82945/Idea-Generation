1. **Investigate the neuroprotective effects of picein in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases.** This could be done by administering picein to animals with neurodegenerative diseases and assessing its effects on disease progression and symptoms.
2. **Determine the molecular mechanisms by which picein exerts its neuroprotective effects.** This could be done by studying the effects of picein on various cellular processes, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis.
3. **Develop novel picein-based therapies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.** This could involve developing new formulations of picein or combining picein with other neuroprotective agents.
4. **Investigate the potential of picein to prevent neurodegenerative diseases.** This could be done by studying the effects of picein on healthy animals or humans at risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases.
5. **Explore the use of picein as a biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases.** This could involve studying the levels of picein in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid of patients with neurodegenerative diseases and determining whether these levels correlate with disease severity or progression.
