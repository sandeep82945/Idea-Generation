            "text": "As an emerging nanomaterial, gold nanoclusters have been widely used in bioimaging,1,2 optoelectronics3,4 and other elds.5,6 Especially in terms of uorescent materials, they have become a substitute for many traditional uorescent materials. As a new type of uorescent cluster, Au NCs have better uorescence performance than organic uorescent molecules (such as semiconductor quantum dots), and have the advantages of mild synthesis conditions and environment friendliness.7,8 However, most reported Au NCs have a single emission wavelength. The single emission peak of gold nanoclusters has certain limitations for the detection and practical application of substances.9,10 The dual-emission gold nanoclusters not only retain the advantages of single-emission gold nanoclusters, but can also detect different substances at the same time, increasing the detection efficiency.11,12 In particular, the dualemitting gold nanoclusters have the ability to self-calibrate,13 allowing more intuitive quantitative analysis.14,15 Therefore, the ratio uorescence analysis method of Au NCs with two emission wavelengths has great research value.\nPhenylalanine, as one of the essential amino acids of the human body, takes part in glucose metabolism and fat metabolism.16,17 The Guthrie bacterial growth inhibition assay18,19 is a common method to detect phenylalanine levels, but it takes a long time and requires rigorous testing conditions. Therefore, it is very important to develop a convenient and efficient method\nd Viral Oncology, Faculty of Environment No. 100, Pingleyuan, Chaoyang District, edu.cn\n2067\nfor the detection of phenylalanine. Fe3+ is an essential trace element in life activities,20,21 and it is an important redox pair in electron transport and various enzyme reactions.22,23 The lack and excess of iron ions will have some negative effects,24,25 Commonly used methods for iron ion determination, such as voltammetry, ame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (FAAS), inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), are time-consuming and complicated.26,27 Therefore, a fast, low-cost, high-sensitivity and easy-to-operate method has attracted more and more attention, and the design of a uorescent nanoprobe suitable for Fe3+ analysis still has value and signicance.\nThe luminescence properties of metal clusters are affected by the synthesis method and ligand\u2013metal charge transfer (LMCT) or ligand\u2013metal\u2013metal charge transfer (LMMCT). Doping other metal elements or ligands in the metal clusters can induce the LMCT effect and improve the luminescence properties. For the template method, the formation of Au NCs is achieved by reducing gold ions to the zero-valence state in the presence of thiol-terminated small molecules and a template-containing cavity. The selection of suitable templates is important for the synthesis of metal clusters that are stable and have special emission wavelengths. GSH-Au NCs with Au(0) core doped with 11-MUA can promote the LMCT effect to enable gold clusters with dual emission peaks. Herein, we directly synthesized dualemissive gold nanoclusters (d-Au NCs) through surface ligand exchange and surface motif optimization and reconstruction, the synthesis process without additional assembly or conjugated. Synthesis of d-Au NCs was divided into two stages, the rst stage is to synthesize GSH-Au NCs by template method, and the second stage is to exchange surface ligands and reconstruct surface motifs on the basis of GSH-Au NCs.

As the concentration of phenylalanine increases (0\u2013140 mM), under the excitation of 350 nm, the emission intensity at 600 nm gradually increases to about 3 times the original intensity, while the emission intensity at 430 nm remains consistent.\nThe color of mixed solution gradually turns from pink to red under UV light. The ratio of uorescence intensity at 600 nm\nand 430 nm has a linear relationship with the concentration of phenylalanine, and the detection limit is 3.9 mM (Fig. 3B). This indicates that d-Au NCs can be used as a ratio probe for the quantication of phenylalanine and the detection process can be completed within 5 minutes. In addition, a variety of other amino acids have been tested, but only phenylalanine has good selectivity.\nD-Au NCs not only has a good uorescence effect on phenylalanine, but also a good uorescence response to Fe3+.

            "text": "In summary, we successfully synthesized dual-emissive gold nanoclusters without additional assembly or conjugation. The uorescence lifetime and nanostructure of d-Au NCs have been studied and conrmed through steady-state/transient uorescence spectrometer and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The average decay times of the d-Au NCs were 5.8 ms for 430 nm emission and 10 ms for 600 nm emission. The particle size of d-Au NCs is uniform, and the diameter is 1.75 0.3 nm. Based on the LMCT effects generated by surface motif reconstruction, dAu NCs have two emission peaks at the same time. Different from the detection of a single species by a single emission peak, d-Au NCs can realize the simultaneous exploration of two different species. The prepared gold nanoclusters can complete the detection of phenylalanine and Fe3+ withinveminutes at room temperature. Under ultraviolet light irradiation, the naked eye can directly monitor the detection effect through the change of color. The prepared uorescence sensor offered high selectivity for phenylalanine and Fe3+ over other amino acids. D-Au NCs have higher detection efficiency than single emission metal clusters. This detection method can provide faster and easier multi-substance detection compared to traditional detection methods. Therefore, we conceive that this study will encourage the further development of Au NCs for simultaneous detection of multiple species.\nAuthor contribution\nChenchen Kong: design the experimental process, synthetic polymers, write and revise the manuscript.
