INTRODUCTION\nIn this article, I focused on the notion of \u201cmoe-phobia,\u201d which is disgust toward female manga-like virtual agents who are perceived as sexual. \u201cMoe-phobia\u201d is one problem regarding the gender of agents and users. This word was suggested by Ito (Azuma, 2003). Ito defined it as the tendency to deny one\u2019s own feelings about being attracted to a virtual character. Later, Ito extended the notion of this word and included the intense disgust toward female virtual agents and the desire to ostracize these agents (Ito, 2008). In this article, I use \u201cmoe-phobia\u201d in the latter meaning. This intense disgust toward virtual agents can cause systems that use virtual agents to be rejected, which is, thus, a large problem for HAI (human-agent interaction). The research question is how an agent\u2019s appearance and context affect moe-phobia.\n\u201cMoe\u201d is originally a Japanese slang word meaning the strong positive emotions felt toward fictional characters, especially girl-like manga characters (Galbraith, 2009). Today, manga-like female characters appearing in fiction and media are generally called \u201cmoe-characters\u201d in Japan. In this article, I use the term \u201cmoe-phobia\u201d instead of simply \u201cnegative feelings toward female mangalike characters\u201d for the following reasons. First, many public and private organizations in Japan\nhave used moe-characters for public relations (PR) even though almost all controversies regarding female manga-like characters have been caused by moe-characters. These usages and controversies seem to have been caused by a divergence in people\u2019s impression of the concept of \u201cmoe.\u201d Thus, I focus on this divergence, especially between genders. Second, Ito suggested the notion of \u201cmoe-phobia\u201d in research on Japanese fiction culture (Ito, 2008). Limniati pointed out that Japanese manga and anime affected real human-robot interaction and humanagent interaction (Limniati, 2017). Also, the appearance of virtual YouTubers seems to have been influenced by Japanesemanga and anime. Thus, the notion of \u201cmoe-phobia\u201d could be transferred from research on manga and anime to HAI.\nManga-like virtual agents are widely used on the web and in the real world. On the web, virtual YouTubers are avatars that are agents operated by streamers and who act as real celebrities (Shirai, 2019; Zhou, 2020; Lu et al., 2021). The number of them is higher than 13,000 as of December 2020 (TEC, 2020), and together, they have earned more than 4,00,000 dollars in total via Super Chat (PLA, 2020).Many virtual YouTubers are human-like female virtual agents who look like Japanese manga characters.\nAlso, female virtual agents are widely used in the real world. \u201cMei\u201d is a Japanese human-like female agent that was developed by the Nagoya Institute of Technology, and Mei appears on digital signage as a guide for the campus (Lee et al., 2013). \u201cHatsune Miku\u201d is an animated character from an ordinary voice synthesis software package; however, the 3D model was constructed and is used to perform in concerts as a singer (Leavitt et al., 2016; THEIR, 2016), and Hatsune Miku is also used as a tourism promotion character in Sapporo Endo (2016). KDDI constructed \u201cRena,\u201d a virtual character operated by character AI and executed on an XR system, and Rena was used to promoting Iida city (KDD, 2018). In these cases, virtual agents are used for regional vitalization. In Japan, many virtual characters are used for the same roles, and they are called \u201clocal moe-characters\u201d (Kim, 2017). They are often produced by local authorities and local companies. Many of them are manga-like female virtual characters in Japan.\nThese agents and characters have often been accepted and embraced by the media and people and, thus, have a large effect on society. However, in some cases, they get flamed on the web, and there are various discussions with respect to gender bias and sexual expression (refer to Section 2).\nIn the research field of HAI, other practical uses of virtual agents have been widely researched, e.g., in the role of medical counselors (Parmar et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2021) and for product recommendation (Qiu and Benbasat, 2009; Matsui and Yamada, 2019). In these cases, female virtual agents are often used. Thus, investigating why some people are disgusted by female virtual agents is an important problem for HAI.\nFlaming on the web is a serious problem on recent social networking sites (SNSs) (Moor et al., 2010; Helfrich, 2014; Jane, 2015; Hwang et al., 2016). This is a phenomenon in which an avalanche of negative comments or slander appears in response to particular news or people. Typically, flaming arises and spreads on SNSs and often leads to serious results, crime, and leaking of private information (Mori and Takeda, 2019). Moe-phobia often\nleads to flaming on the web (refer to Section 2); however, the fundamental reason for this has not been sufficiently researched.\nMany pieces of prior study focused on agents\u2019 and participants\u2019 gender in HAI. However, these studies often had contradictory results. Payne et al. showed that female users prefer interacting with agents of the same gender, whereas male users choose an agent of different gender (Payne et al., 2013). Guadagno showed that users prefer agents of their own gender (Guadagno et al., 2007). Kim et al. showed that users (male and female) had an impression of male personified agents as being closer to humans than female personified agents (Kim et al., 2007). These results show inconsistency, demonstrating that the gender of agents and users is a difficult problem to approach with experiments.\nIn addition, it has been reported that what an agent and human wear affects the interaction. K\u00fcster et al. showed that humans judged virtual agents by what they wear without other non-verbal information (K\u00fcster et al., 2019). Their study used female and male virtual agents. Fox and Bailenson conducted an experiment with suggestively and conservatively dressed female virtual agents in virtual reality (VR) and found that genderstereotypical virtual women enhance negative attitudes toward women (Fox and Bailenson, 2009). Wang and Yeh investigated the effect of a female pedagogical agent with sex appeal. They showed that this agent was effective at getting users to study but was perceived as being untrustworthy and unprofessional. These prior studies suggest that gender bias will affect HAI.\nSexual appearance and symbols have often been shown to have a positive effect on advertisements. Wirtz et al. conducted a meta-analysis on studies of sexual appeal in advertisements and found that this appeal had a positive effect on male customers (Wirtz et al., 2018). Huo and Yuan showed that sexual objects (e.g., a female model in swimwear) in advertisements increase the buying motivation of male customers (Huo and Yuan, 2017). These advertisements rarely cause flaming on the web like in the case of female virtual agents in Japan. This could indicate that flaming on the web is unique to these agents. On the other hand, the sexual appeal does not always bring about a positive effect. Daniels and Zurbriggen showed that girls and young women on Facebook that displayed sexualized profile photos were considered as being less physically attractive, less socially attractive, and less competent to complete tasks (Daniels and Zurbriggen, 2016).\nIn this article, I first discuss cases of flaming involving virtual agents and characters in Japan to verify what in particular many people have a problem with: the female virtual character itself, sexual expression, or the social context (aims and situations for which agents or characters are used).\nI hope that this article can contribute to avoiding cases of flaming involving virtual agents and characters and suggest a design method for female virtual agents."

Roughly speaking, they had two complaints:\n\u2022 Kizuna AI\u2019s design is overly sexual (for example, Kizuna AI wears short pants). \u2022 In this program, Kizuna AI only listened to the commentary, which could perpetuate gender role divisions.\nCritics pointed out that Kizuna AI was not suitable for NHK\u2019s TV program for these two reasons (Ando, 2018). The important point is that NHK is a public broadcasting station in Japan. Many critics said that a \u201cpublic\u201d organization should not use moe-characters like Kizuna AI (Ando, 2018)."

The main criticisms have focused on the appearance of her clothes design, especially on the leg line showing through her skirt.

As a result, some people criticized this poster because it looked\noverly sexual (Ariyoshi, 2019). On the poster, Uzaki-chan was completely clothed, but critics focused on her attractive body line. The same as the above two cases, criticisms of this case centered on two problems; the character looks sexual, and this poster was posted up in public spaces (Ariyoshi, 2019). One critic (Kiiko Ota) claimed that this poster was environmental sexual harassment (OTA, 2019). Also, some critics called for a blood donation boycott (Ariyoshi, 2019). Later, the author of \u201cUzakichan Wants to Hang Out!\u201d expressed that he was a victim of the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake and that this was the reason for collaborating with the Japanese Red Cross Society (Amdo, 2020)."

Atsugi Co., Ltd. is a Japanese underwear maker and also produces tights. This campaign showed many mangalike illustrations of a female character who wore tights (long underwear). After beginning this campaign, negative opinions against these illustrations appeared on Twitter (The Asahi Shimbun, 2020). Critics said that these illustrations regarded tights as sexual items and that a company that produces tights for female customers must not hold such a campaign (The Asahi Shimbun, 2020). In this case, the company\u2019s nature became one important factor that caused the incident. From this case, I have observed that a company\u2019s or organization\u2019s social role is important when they use female virtual characters. This is one kind of usage context."

The second is influenced by the social context in which virtual characters are used. Here, one question arises; which reason is more important formoe-phobia? Or do these two factors influence human perception through the interaction of the two? This is an important problem in designing virtual agents in the real world. If virtual agents are used for entertainment, sexual appearancemay be one point of attraction. However, when the context is public service, will the same agents be effective? This problem has not been researched yet.\nIn fact, the appearance of characters and the context are possibly interdependent; e.g., a school uniform may generate impressions of both sex appeal and educational context. However, many critics have stated that these two problems are independent in actual moe-phobia controversies. Thus, I think that conducting an experiment focusing on these two factors would be useful.\nTherefore, I hypothesize the following. H: Moe-phobia is associated with not only an agent\u2019s appearance (clothes) but also the context (scenario). In other words, I hypothesize that moe-phobia is associated with three factors: appearance, context, and users\u2019 gender. In this article, I conducted an experiment to investigate the effect of these three factors of female virtual agents on users\u2019 perceived resistance. As stated above, the three factors were the agents\u2019 appearance, the context in which they are used, and the gender of the participants in the experiment. For appearance, I used agents wearing clothes that were sexual (swimsuit) or not sexual. For context, I used a formal context and an entertainment context. With this experiment, I aimed to verify which factor was larger or if all three factors influenced users\u2019 perception through the interaction of the three."

They had the same facial and physical parts except for their clothes. For the business suit level, the agent wore a dark business suit. For the swimsuit level, the agent wore a swimsuit. This level seemed to be more sexual than the business suit level. These two levels were the appearance factor. Figure 2 shows these two agents.\nI used only female agents in this experiment and did not use male agents. This is because, in all actual social cases (refer to Section 2), only female virtual agents were the subject of discussion. So far, moe-phobia has been caused only in regard\n1https://vkatsu.jp/\nto female agents. Thus, I focused on only female agents in this article.\nAlso, I constructed two scenarios in which the agents were used. At the municipal office level, the agents played the role of reception guides in a municipal office. I defined this scenario as a formal context in which the agents were used. For the anime shop level, the agents played the role of a clerk in an anime shop. In both scenarios, the agents spoke different texts. Table 1 shows the text for both levels.\nThis experimental design was derived on the basis of case studies. In all actual moe-phobia incidents, female agents have been used in public spaces or by public organizations. Also, these agents have traditionally been used in anime or games. Thus, I used a municipal office situation and an anime shop situation for the scenarios.\nIn both scenarios, the agents were displayed against a blue-sky background as in Figure 2. In this experiment, the agent system, which was designed as if it were appearing on digital signage, and the place (municipal office or anime shop) were assumed to be identifiable from the agents\u2019 speech.\nEach agent moved as she looked around the audience and moved her lips while speaking.\nIn the experiment, human-agent interaction was a onedirection interaction (the participants just watched movies). This is because real moe-phobia incidents have mostly been the result of one-direction interactions (TV shows, posters, and SNS advertisements).\nI conducted the experiment with four conditions. Table 2 shows two factors for each condition. I created four kinds of movies in which virtual agents spoke for each condition. One participant watched only one movie.

This is the most important result of this experiment. The female and male participants\ntended to have different impressions of the agents; however, they tended to have the same perception of the agents\u2019 suitability. This result suggests that the agents in sexual clothes (swimwear) and a formal context (municipal office) were not accepted by the female and male participants. Also, the swimwear and the anime shop itself did not negatively affect the agents\u2019 perceived suitability; only the combination of the two generated a negative effect. From prior studies, only appearance or sexual visual symbols were indicated as the reason for there being an impression of sexuality (Huo and Yuan, 2017; Wirtz et al., 2018). K\u00fcster et al. showed that participants judged female virtual agents by what they wore (K\u00fcster et al., 2019). Their experiment was conducted without any verbal information. My findings also show that what they wear is important; however, this effect was influenced by context and the participants\u2019 gender. My finding redefined this model.\nSecond, this result suggests an important aspect in designing virtual agents to avoid moe-phobia. Sexual clothes do not always lead to moe-phobia; the context (situation) is another important factor for moe-phobia. Thus, the context in which these agents are used must also be considered. Also, the results of this experiment show that an actual controversy may be caused by not only the agents\u2019 appearance but also the situation in which the agents are used. In this experiment, the female and male participants did not judge the suitability of the agents from only the agents\u2019 clothes. Casual situations may allow the use of an agent in swimwear, while formal situations may not. Also, in advertisements, sexual visual symbols are widely used and can have a positive effect (Huo and Yuan, 2017; Wirtz et al., 2018). The findings show that a sexual female virtual agent will have a negative effect in some contexts. In summary, moe-phobia was substantially caused by the context.\nThird, this result seems to be able to explain the contradiction among previous studies regarding the gender of agents and participants. Previous studies that focused on agents\u2019 and participants\u2019 gender had contradictory results (Guadagno et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2007; Payne et al., 2013). This finding suggests\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 11 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 752748\nthat these different results may be caused by the context in which the agents were used. Also, I suggest that a study on the impression given by agents\u2019 gender (especially sexuality and suitability) should consider the experimental context.\nFinally, this finding suggests a way of avoiding moe-phobia incidents; social context is as important as the agents\u2019 appearance. To avoid moe-phobia, we should design virtual characters considering the context and users\u2019 gender."

Also, it is an important problem to determine whether these results are particular to Japanese participants or not. To solve this problem, I have to conduct a cross-cultural experiment.

For example, the Love-tights incident seemed to be partly caused by opposition to the idea that tights symbolize female sexuality."

I referred to this phenomenon as \u201cmoe-phobia.\u201d After discussing actual incidents, I hypothesized that moe-phobia is associated with not only the appearance of agents but also the situations in which they are used. Thus, I planned an experiment with three factors and two levels. The independent values were the agents\u2019 clothes (business suit and swimwear) and their usage scenario (municipal office and anime shop). I created four kinds of movies in which virtual agents spoke for each condition. Also, I conducted the experiment with a group of female participants and a group of male participants. In the experiment, the participants watched one movie and answered questions about the agents\u2019 trustworthiness, familiarity, likability,\nsexuality, and suitability perceived. I conducted a three-way ANOVA on each score for the female and male groups. As a result, I observed a different tendency in the impression of the agents between the female and male groups; however, both groups had the same tendency regarding suitability. The female and male participants judged the agents\u2019 suitability from not only the agents\u2019 clothes but also the scenario. This result suggests new guidelines for designing virtual agents that are used in public spaces.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\nETHICS STATEMENT\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Seikei University.
