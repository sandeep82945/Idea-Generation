    "abstractText": "Background: ETHER (\u201cEducation THE\u00e9rapeutique pour la R\u00e9duction des dommages en alcoologie\u201d or Therapeutic education for alcohol-related harm reduction) is a multicentre community\u2010based mixed\u2010methods study, which aims to evalu\u2010 ate the effectiveness of the innovative therapeutic patient education (TPE) programme \u2018Choizitaconso\u2019 in a sample of French people with alcohol use disorder (people with AUD). Choizitaconso teaches people with AUD psychosocial skills to help them (re)establish controlled drinking and reduce alcohol\u2010related harms. Recruitment started in October 2019. We present here the protocol of the ETHER study. Methods: ETHER\u2019s quantitative component involves a 6\u2010month controlled intervention study which evaluates Choizitaconso\u2019s effectiveness by comparing 30 people with AUD following the programme with a control group of 60 people with AUD not enrolled in it, using a questionnaire co\u2010constructed by the research team and members of the people with AUD community. Thirty\u2010four alcohol\u2010related harms are assessed and summed to provide an individual measure of the \u2018harm burden\u2019 from consuming alcohol (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes are anticipated and internalized stigma, alcohol consumption measures, craving for alcohol, coping strategies, health\u2010related quality of life, self\u2010confidence to control or abstain from drinking, treatment self\u2010regulation, anxiety and depressive symptoms, alcohol\u2010related neuropsychological impairments, and capabilities (a measure of wellbeing in adults). Data will be col\u2010 lected in face\u2010to\u2010face and phone\u2010based interviews at enrolment and 6 months later. Linear regression models will be used to assess the impact of the TPE programme on changes in the primary and secondary outcomes, while adjust\u2010 ing for other correlates and confounders. The study\u2019s qualitative component comprises semi\u2010structured interviews with 16 people with AUD who have already completed the TPE programme at least 6 months before the interview. Qualitative interviews will be analysed using thematic analysis. Results and conclusions: ETHER is the first evaluation study of an innovative TPE programme specifically designed to reduce alcohol\u2010related harms and reach controlled drinking in France.

Harm Reduction Journal (2022) 19:2 Background Alcohol is the second leading cause of avoidable death after tobacco. In France, 41,000 deaths\u2014or 7% of all deaths\u2014were attributed to alcohol consumption in 2015 [1]. From an economic perspective, alcohol was responsible for a loss to the French economy of almost four billion euros in 2010, with an estimated social cost (i.e., the total monetary and non-monetary cost because of alcohol use) of almost 120 billion euros [2]. Worldwide, alcohol is the most dangerous psychoactive substance in terms of physical and social harms for users and for society [3]. Harmful alcohol use is linked to over 200 health conditions, ranging from liver disease, road injuries and violence, to cancer, cardiovascular disease, suicide, tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) [4]. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress [5]. Its diagnosis is based on multiple occurrence of given criteria within a 12-month period, and short screening tools such as the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification TestConcise (AUDIT-C) shows good performance to detect AUD [6]. Cognitive impairments can be found in 50\u201380% of people with alcohol use disorder (AUD) [7], including executive dysfunction, episodic memory deficits and visuospatial disabilities. The term \u2018people with AUD\u2019 is chosen throughout the manuscript as a non-stigmatizing, non-judgmental term based on \u2018person-first language\u2019 that shifts away from defining a person through the lens of disease [8]. There is extensive literature on evidenced-based psychosocial interventions for alcohol use disorder (AUD) [9]. Brief interventions\u2014which comprise counselling and simple assessment of current or potential problems with substance use\u2014are the psychosocial interventions most recommended to achieve low-risk alcohol use among hazardous and harmful drinkers [10]. Typically delivered in a single session in primary care settings, there is a great deal of evidence for their effectiveness, particularly in individuals with mild AUD and people with atrisk alcohol use who are not very concerned about their consumption [11]. Motivational interviews and cognitive behavioural therapies are two psychosocial interventions which are also effective in reducing alcohol use [12]. They are more intense than brief interventions. While difficult to quantify, psychosocial interventions may be of interest as early as a low-to-moderate AUD, while pharmacological treatments may be more suitable for moderate-tosevere AUD [9]. The examination of the combined effect of both approaches represents a great opportunity for research. There are elements pointing at the superiority of the combination over single-approach treatment [13\u201316]. Although AUD concerns approximately 3.5 million people in France [4], more than half of this population have never received appropriate treatment [17, 18]. In the U.S., among those with 12-month and lifetime diagnoses of AUD, only 7.7% and 19.8%, respectively, sought treatment [19]. Common barriers to seeking treatment are a lack of awareness about living with AUD, fear of stigmatization, and apprehension about total abstinence [20]. With regard to the latter, alternative treatment approaches have emerged in recent years that aim to minimize the harmful consequences associated with alcohol use in people who fail with, or simply refuse, total abstinence as a therapeutic option. These alternative harm reduction approaches, including controlled drinking (CD) interventions, alleviate alcohol-induced harms by reducing the total amount of alcohol consumption and by modifying drinking patterns [21, 22]. Such CD interventions have also been developed within the concept of pre-habilitation, i.e. offered to individuals prior to detoxification and while the person is still drinking [23]. A recent systematic review highlighted that \u201cevidence does not support abstinence as the only approach in the treatment of alcohol use disorder. Controlled drinking, particularly if supported by specific psychotherapy, appears to be a viable option where an abstinence-oriented approach is not applicable\u201d [24]. Therapeutic patient education (TPE) is a relatively recent practice, defined by the WHO in 1998 as \u201ceducational activities essential to the management of pathological conditions, managed by health care providers duly trained in the field of education, designed to help a patient (or a group of patients and their families) to community in selecting which experienced and perceived alcohol\u2010related harms to measure ensures that ETHER will provide healthcare staff and researchers with a relevant set of harm reduction criteria for use in future research. Finally, ETHER will provide scientific justification for implementing novel alcohol\u2010related harm reduction approaches and champion controlled drinking as a therapeutic goal.

Thirty\u2011four alcohol\u2011related harms are assessed and summed to provide an individual measure of the \u2018harm burden\u2019 from consuming alcohol (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes are anticipated and internalized stigma, alcohol consumption measures, craving for alcohol, coping strategies, health\u2011related quality of life, self\u2011confidence to control or abstain from drinking, treatment self\u2011regulation, anxiety and depressive symptoms, alcohol\u2011related neuropsychological impairments, and capabilities (a measure of wellbeing in adults). Data will be col\u2011 lected in face\u2011to\u2011face and phone\u2011based interviews at enrolment and 6 months later. Linear regression models will be used to assess the impact of the TPE programme on changes in the primary and secondary outcomes, while adjust\u2011 ing for other correlates and confounders. The study\u2019s qualitative component comprises semi\u2011structured interviews with 16 people with AUD who have already completed the TPE programme at least 6 months before the interview. Qualitative interviews will be analysed using thematic analysis.\nResults and conclusions: ETHER is the first evaluation study of an innovative TPE programme specifically designed to reduce alcohol\u2011related harms and reach controlled drinking in France.

            "text": "Alcohol is the second leading cause of avoidable death after tobacco. In France, 41,000 deaths\u2014or 7% of all deaths\u2014were attributed to alcohol consumption in 2015 [1]. From an economic perspective, alcohol was responsible for a loss to the French economy of almost four billion euros in 2010, with an estimated social cost (i.e., the total monetary and non-monetary cost because of alcohol use) of almost 120 billion euros [2]. Worldwide, alcohol is the most dangerous psychoactive substance in terms of physical and social harms for users and for society [3]. Harmful alcohol use is linked to over 200 health conditions, ranging from liver disease, road injuries and violence, to cancer, cardiovascular disease, suicide, tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) [4]. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress [5]. Its diagnosis is based on multiple occurrence of given criteria within a 12-month period, and short screening tools such as the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification TestConcise (AUDIT-C) shows good performance to detect AUD [6]. Cognitive impairments can be found in 50\u201380% of people with alcohol use disorder (AUD) [7], including executive dysfunction, episodic memory deficits and visuospatial disabilities. The term \u2018people with AUD\u2019 is chosen throughout the manuscript as a non-stigmatizing, non-judgmental term based on \u2018person-first language\u2019 that shifts away from defining a person through the lens of disease [8].\nThere is extensive literature on evidenced-based psychosocial interventions for alcohol use disorder (AUD) [9]. Brief interventions\u2014which comprise counselling and simple assessment of current or potential problems with substance use\u2014are the psychosocial interventions most recommended to achieve low-risk alcohol use among hazardous and harmful drinkers [10]. Typically delivered in a single session in primary care settings, there is a great deal of evidence for their effectiveness, particularly in individuals with mild AUD and people with atrisk alcohol use who are not very concerned about their consumption [11]. Motivational interviews and cognitive behavioural therapies are two psychosocial interventions\nwhich are also effective in reducing alcohol use [12]. They are more intense than brief interventions. While difficult to quantify, psychosocial interventions may be of interest as early as a low-to-moderate AUD, while pharmacological treatments may be more suitable for moderate-tosevere AUD [9]. The examination of the combined effect of both approaches represents a great opportunity for research. There are elements pointing at the superiority of the combination over single-approach treatment [13\u201316].\nAlthough AUD concerns approximately 3.5 million people in France [4], more than half of this population have never received appropriate treatment [17, 18]. In the U.S., among those with 12-month and lifetime diagnoses of AUD, only 7.7% and 19.8%, respectively, sought treatment [19]. Common barriers to seeking treatment are a lack of awareness about living with AUD, fear of stigmatization, and apprehension about total abstinence [20]. With regard to the latter, alternative treatment approaches have emerged in recent years that aim to minimize the harmful consequences associated with alcohol use in people who fail with, or simply refuse, total abstinence as a therapeutic option. These alternative harm reduction approaches, including controlled drinking (CD) interventions, alleviate alcohol-induced harms by reducing the total amount of alcohol consumption and by modifying drinking patterns [21, 22]. Such CD interventions have also been developed within the concept of pre-habilitation, i.e. offered to individuals prior to detoxification and while the person is still drinking [23]. A recent systematic review highlighted that \u201cevidence does not support abstinence as the only approach in the treatment of alcohol use disorder. Controlled drinking, particularly if supported by specific psychotherapy, appears to be a viable option where an abstinence-oriented approach is not applicable\u201d [24].\nTherapeutic patient education (TPE) is a relatively recent practice, defined by the WHO in 1998 as \u201ceducational activities essential to the management of pathological conditions, managed by health care providers duly trained in the field of education, designed to help a patient (or a group of patients and their families) to\ncommunity in selecting which experienced and perceived alcohol\u2011related harms to measure ensures that ETHER will provide healthcare staff and researchers with a relevant set of harm reduction criteria for use in future research. Finally, ETHER will provide scientific justification for implementing novel alcohol\u2011related harm reduction approaches and champion controlled drinking as a therapeutic goal.\nTrial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03954054.

This approach rose from the acknowledgement that citizens themselves could improve on their health through behavioral factors, and that finally, health care cannot be effective without provider\u2013patient and provider\u2013provider communication, as well as inclusion of the patient\u2019s social environment in treatment decisions [26]. TPE is therefore a patient-centred, multidisciplinary approach that aims to promote autonomy, improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and coping skills. In France, TPE guidelines were first published by the National Authority for Health in 2007 [27].\nThe efficacy of TPE is growingly documented [28], as well as its cost-effectiveness [29], at least for some chronic diseases. TPE brings together several disciplines including clinical sciences, humanities and public health, using mixed (i.e., quantitative and qualitative) methods. A quantitative analysis carried out in 2009 looking at 10\u00a0years of international publications and covering 41 chronic diseases, showed a clear increase in the number of articles on TPE and a growing corpus of randomized controlled trials [30]. TPE is effective in preventing complications and in improving health outcomes, including HRQoL, for people living with obesity and other chronic diseases such as diabetes, asthma and cardiovascular disease [28]. However, its benefits in addiction medicine, especially regarding AUD, have not been explored in detail. Of the 3378 TPE programmes listed in France in January 2014, only 35 were related to substance use disorders [31].\nIn Canada, community-based programs aiming to reduce harms of severe alcohol use without expecting cessation of use have been implemented [32], with positive results in terms of reduction in alcohol-related harms [33]. Those programs, in addition to alcohol intervention, provided primary care services, social and cultural interventions [32]. To date, few programmes aimed at harm reduction for people with AUD have been implemented or evaluated in Europe. Two examples are Alcochoix+, a Canadian CD programme imported and adopted by Switzerland [34], and the Outpatient Group Treatment Programme for Controlled Drinking, a 10-week behavioural self-control training programme for hazardous, harmful and dependent drinkers in Germany [35, 36].\nAlcochoix+ was evaluated in a Swiss cohort study of 60 middle-aged men with moderate alcohol dependence (median AUDIT score equal to 20.5 and median weekly alcohol consumption equal to 350\u00a0g) at inclusion.\nAt the end of the program, results showed a median weekly alcohol consumption reduction of 160\u00a0 g, a decrease of the mean AUDIT score to 14.1 points, and a slight improvement in HRQoL [34]. Similar results were\nfound in a randomized controlled trial evaluating the German CD programme in 58 middle-aged subjects (19 women and 39 men) with an average weekly alcohol consumption 560\u00a0g. By the end of the programme, individuals in the intervention group had significantly reduced their alcohol consumption by 50% (from 678 to 354\u00a0 g), whereas changes in the control group were not statistically significant [35]. Therefore, more evaluations are needed in Europe to establish the suitability and effectiveness of alcohol-related TPE, especially regarding harm reduction outcomes.\nThe primary objective of the study presented here\u2014 entitled ETHER\u2014is to evaluate the effectiveness of the TPE programme Choizitaconso [37] for reducing alcohol-related harms in a sample of French people with AUD using a mixed-methods approach. In France, the TPE programme Choizitaconso [37] was developed in order to reduce alcohol-related harms among adult people with AUD. In this article, we present the protocol of the mixed-methods ETHER study, which aims to evaluate this programme in a sample of French people with AUD. This detailed description of the research hypotheses, data collected and methods used may help other researchers involved in the implementation or evaluation of such TPE programmes. Analyses of data collected within the ETHER study are still ongoing, with a release of results scheduled in the coming months."

Casanova, in collaboration with the people with AUD community there, and then implemented for the first time in a CSAPA there [37]. Its objectives are to reduce alcoholrelated harms and to improve participants\u2019 health conditions and HRQoL by teaching psychosocial skills which help them (re)establish self-determined CD. It values the participants\u2019 potential to control their alcohol consumption while taking into account their emotional state and their motivation to drink or abstain from alcohol, without interpreting them as being pathological. Participants are free to choose drinking goals that best fit their individual needs, in line with clinical practice recommendations for harmful alcohol use [10].\nEach Choizitaconso programme session lasts for 10\u00a0weeks for each participant and consists of the following five modules, including one optional module focusing on the family environment:\n1. Understanding the mechanisms that trigger and/or maintain alcohol-related difficulties. 2. Planning and evaluating personalized CD strategies.\n3. Understanding and identifying external and internal influences (e.g., thoughts and emotions); identifying and managing risk situations. 4. Identifying alcohol effects and alcohol-related expectations (by developing self-observation skills). 5. Family environment: learning how to observe and evaluate familial situations in order to best position oneself and take care of oneself (e.g., learning how to better express feelings).\nEach module consists of two to four collective workshops that each last 120\u00a0min and involve 5\u201310 persons. Workshop objectives and themes are presented in Fig.\u00a01. During the workshops, theoretical input is reduced progressively in order to promote collaborative work and colearning between the participants.\nParticipants also attend several individual meetings with medical staff before, during and after the programme (cf. Fig.\u00a0 1). Moreover, Choizitaconso includes remote monitoring at 3, 6 and 12\u00a0months after the programme ends, in order to assess craving, frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption and global quality of life. The multidisciplinary team in charge of the programme comprises three physicians specialized in addictology (including the programme coordinator), two registered nurses, two specialized educators, a psychologist, and a prevention manager. All healthcare providers involved in the programme have received training in TPE and substance use disorders."

ETHER aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the TPE programme Choizitaconso in terms of alcohol-related harm reduction. It will provide important information for implementing and assessing this CD programme in other contexts. It will also provide healthcare professionals with an effective, validated and acceptable healthcare programme for people with AUD which can be combined, if desired, with other pharmacologic approaches according to the individual patient\u2019s needs and wishes. It uses a mixed-methods approach which comprises (1) a qualitative study with former participants of the Choizitaconso TPE programme and (2) a controlled intervention study comparing current participants of the programme (i.e., the intervention group) with people with AUD receiving inpatient and outpatient care but not participating in the programme (i.e., the control group). This control group was included in the study design in order to check for the presence of any impairment in the outcomes for people who participated in Choizitaconso, compared with people who did not. This recurrent 10-week programme takes place in a specialized service for substance use disorders (called CSAPA in France) in Avignon. Numerous positive qualitative feedbacks from former participants encouraged the implementation of an objective evaluation in order to consider further dissemination of the programme in other CSAPAs.\nBoth the development of the Choizitaconso programme (which main steps are described at the beginning of the Methods section) and its evaluation (i.e. ETHER) were based on guidelines set down for community-based participatory research [38]. This approach, involving endusers in the co-creation of public health interventions is thought to increase adherence and effectiveness due to empowering end-users to develop outcomes tailored to their circumstances. ETHER included such principles by noticeably (1) collecting TPE programme users\u2019 discourse in order to allow for benefits non reported in the quantitative study but relevant for users to emerge and be taken into account and (2) co-constructing the quantitative outcome with users in order for it to fit with their main concerns and priorities.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from each patient before enrolment. The protocol was undertaken in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and French law for biomedical research and was approved by the CPP Sud-Est 4 ethics committee (Lyon, France)."

The secondary objectives are to assess the TPE programme\u2019s impact on stigma, HRQoL, alcohol consumption, craving for alcohol, alcohol-related neuropsychological impairments, anxiety and depressive symptoms, coping strategies, treatment self-regulation, self-confidence to control or abstain from drinking, and capabilities (a measure of wellbeing in adults).\nControlled intervention study outcomes Principal outcome The controlled intervention study comprises a 34-item ad-hoc questionnaire administered through a Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI). The items relate to 34 different psychosocial, behavioural and physical harms. They were chosen according to a Delphi approach as follows: first, a list of possible questions were identified by the study\u2019s researchers in the international literature from existing and validated questionnaires; second, during several working sessions, peer educators (former people with AUD), approved or adapted those questions from the list which they felt would guarantee the relevance of the study outcomes. Collaboration between the peer educators and the research team followed the guidelines set down for community-based participatory research [38].\nThe 34 alcohol-related harms are measured as dichotomous (yes/no) variables. The controlled intervention study\u2019s primary outcome is the number of alcohol-related harms experienced (ranging between 0 and 34). This number provides a measure of the \u2018harm burden\u2019 of alcohol use. Alcohol-related harms are assessed at enrolment for the intervention group (i.e., before the study participant commences the Choizitaconso TPE) and 6\u00a0months later (i.e., 14\u00a0weeks after the end of the programme).\nFor further information on the different alcohol-related harms, see Table\u00a01 below.\nSecondary outcomes The controlled intervention study\u2019s secondary outcomes are anticipated and internalized stigma (stigma being of high importance as it is associated with care avoidance or delayed care [39]), quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption, craving for alcohol, coping strategies, HRQoL, self-confidence to control or abstain from drinking, treatment self-regulation, anxiety and depressive symptoms, alcohol-related neuropsychological impairments and capabilities. Each is measured at programme initiation and 6\u00a0months later. The measure-\nment methods (face-to-face interview and CATI interview) and the questionnaires used are listed in Table\u00a02."

People attending those two CSAPAs and the clinic and eligible to participate were identified by the local staff and then proposed to participate in the study during a medical or psychosocial visit. Those who accepted signed the informed consent and were enrolled. In the private clinic, participants were hospitalized for 5\u00a0 weeks, and underwent a medically-supervised withdrawal. Pharmacological treatments were dispensed according to their individual needs, and participants benefited from a multidisciplinary follow-up. After the hospitalization, participants were followed-up as outpatients at the same clinic, were referred to another addictology service (such as a CSAPA), or to their general practitioner according to their geographical constraints. In both CSAPAs, the \u2018treatment as usual\u2019 consisted in tailored and patient-centred care plans. According to participant\u2019s history, needs and demands, they regularly came to the centres to benefit from social and psychosocial followup and participate in individual and/or group activities. Pharmacological treatments were dispensed according to their individual needs and therapeutic objectives.\nParticipants in both groups (i.e. intervention and control) were assessed at study enrolment (M0) and again 6\u00a0 months later (M6) (i.e., 14\u00a0 weeks after they end the Choizitaconso programme), using both a CATI and individual face-to-face interview (Fig.\u00a03).\nAnxiety and depressive symptoms, alcohol-related neuropsychological impairments and capabilities were assessed in the face-to-face interview. In the CATI interview, data on the primary outcome and other secondary outcomes were collected as were sociodemographic and medical data (Table\u00a02). Alcohol consumption was measured using a short form of the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT-C) [40]."

As there are no comparative estimates in the literature to predict the natural variation in the number of alcohol-related harms over follow-up after a TPE intervention, the sample size was computed according to the following assumptions: (1) the Choizitaconso TPE programme will be considered effective if it results in a reduction of at least 30% in the number of alcohol-related harms in the intervention group vs. an expected 5% reduction in the control group\nover a 6-month period. With an alpha = 0.05 and a power of 80%, we estimated we would need 30 individuals in the intervention group and 60 in the control group to be able to demonstrate a significant difference between both groups."

This prevents future researchers and healthcare professionals from being able to reproduce these interventions and conduct implementation science. Lagger et\u00a0 al.

While we are aware that the level of detail provided in the present programme description does not enable for replication, main themes and methodologies implemented are provided. Through this protocol, interested researchers can be aware of what is being evaluated and get in touch with our team if interested for more details.\nChoizitaconso was designed in accordance with TPE guidelines for chronic diseases [43]. It prioritizes the participants\u2019 development of psychosocial skills and helps them to realise their full potential despite their health problems. Moreover, Choizitaconso empowers participants to develop their own needs, objectives, and healthcare decisions. In this way, it enhances participants\u2019\nTable 3 Qualitative study interview guide\n1 Selected (or adapted) from [53\u201356]\nGeneral themes Specific themes to address\nContext for entering the programme Can you say a few words about your alcohol consumption journey? How did you get into this programme? Were you apprehensive? What were your main difficulties / the main damages related to your alcohol consumption?\nProgramme expectations What did you expect from this programme? Did you have specific objectives? Which?\nAssessment of TPE workshops Did you attend all the workshops? What was your experience of the workshops? Did you have particularly pleasant or unpleasant experiences during the workshops? How did you feel at the end of the workshops? What would you say are the strengths and weaknesses of the programme? Were you able to use what you learned in your daily life, right from the start of the programme?\nFeelings after the end of the programme Did you immediately feel that these workshops were useful for you? In what way? What were you able to implement from the things you learned? Did you need help after the programme? If yes, who did you contact?\nImplementation of programme learning Today, how do you use what you learned during the programme? Can you give me examples?\nProgramme benefits Today, are you able to reduce the harms associated with your alcohol consumption? How? Have you reduced the amount of alcohol you consume? In general, what impact has Choizitaconso had on your daily life? Can you give me examples?\nautonomy to responsibly choose and adhere to their own drinking consumption goal.\nIn this respect, Choizitaconso represents a real alternative to approaches exclusively aimed at alcohol abstinence or at drinking reduction. This very characteristic is likely to attract more people with AUD into care, especially those who do not feel ready to or refuse to abstain from alcohol, and who need more pragmatic strategies to avoid at-risk consumption.\nTo our knowledge, ETHER is the first scientific evaluation of a TPE programme specifically created for people with AUD in France. Just as in clinical research, the need for evidence of a programme\u2019s effectiveness is essential in TPE. In the present context, rigorously designed studies evaluating the effectiveness of TPE for people with AUD are needed to provide generalizable results. The research protocol presented here was specifically created for this purpose. Moreover, there is no consensus to date on the types of harms to measure in intervention studies. In this context, ETHER will provide care providers and researchers with a community-validated set of alcoholrelated harms in the context of CD.\nIf ETHER demonstrates Choizitaconso\u2019s effectiveness at reducing alcohol-related harms, it may influence not only AUD care practices but healthcare professionals\u2019 and people with AUD representations about the value of CD as a therapeutic goal, in France and elsewhere. Indeed, few validated alcohol-related TPE are implemented in Europe, and the importation of foreign interventions does not necessarily fit the cultural context around alcohol consumption and users\u2019 needs. Establishing the harm-reducing effectiveness of this programme may lead to an in-depth description of this latter in a (scientific or not) support that can be disseminated and enable replication. It may also lead to explore the cost-effectiveness of the programme in the future. The burden associated with alcohol use is so high that innovative non-pharmacological interventions like this should be evaluated \u201cper se\u201d but also as strategies to be included in a comprehensive model of care including pharmacologic treatments.\nCombining results using a qualitative and quantitative mixed-methods approach, ETHER will provide a more extensive and in-depth view of patients\u2019 perceptions and experiences of the Choizitaconso TPE programme than that offered by separate analyses. More specifically, the qualitative component will help us explore patients\u2019 perceptions long after completing the TPE programme, and will provide information which may be missed in the quantitative study. For instance, former users may be able to clarify what has been the most useful part of the programme for them, or explicit the relationship between parts of the programme and some ETHER\u2019s quantitative outcomes. Such valuable results may thus participate in\na better understanding of mechanisms involved in the harm reduction process, as well as potentially provide some insight for improving the intervention."

            "text": "Our study has limitations. First, assignment to the two study groups (i.e., intervention and control) is not randomised. Nevertheless, specific statistical methodology (selection models) can be applied later, if needed, to control for non-randomization bias. Second, we are using self-reported alcohol use measures, which may be subject to social desirability bias. However, the validity of self-reported alcohol use has been proven in previous research [44], especially when trained interviewers administer the interview in a non-judgmental environment. Lastly, our primary outcome, tailored to our participants, is not yet validated, but we aim to check for its internal consistency during analyses of the results using Cronbach\u2019s alpha."

            "text": "ETHER\u2019s results will pave the way for the possibility of far-reaching developments, including the adaptation and implementation of the Choizitaconso TPE programme throughout Europe, with CD as a therapeutic goal. The programme might also be adapted to other substance use disorders (e.g., cannabis, tobacco) or non-substance addictive behaviours (e.g., pathological gambling, binge eating). Implementing CD programmes in substance use disorder treatment may enable users to control their alcohol intake and to better focus on harm reduction strategies. Choosing one\u2019s own therapeutic goal\u2014thereby becoming an actor in one\u2019s own healthcare management\u2014is likely to be effective for people suffering from substance use disorders other than AUD, and this needs to be studied in greater detail in the future. Moreover, this type of intervention could be offered in low-threshold centres (i.e., harm reduction centres) for drug users, and be made available to populations with psychiatric comorbidities."
