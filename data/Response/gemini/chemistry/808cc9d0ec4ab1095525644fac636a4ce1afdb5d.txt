1. **Investigate the use of other biogenic sources for thiosulfate production.** The current study used a bioreactor for biogas desulfurization to produce biogenic thiosulfate. However, other biogenic sources, such as wastewater treatment plants or food waste, could also be explored for their potential to produce thiosulfate.
2. **Optimize the biogenic thiosulfate production process.** The current study achieved a maximum concentration of 4.9 g Lâˆ’1 of biogenic thiosulfate. However, further optimization of the bioreactor conditions, such as the type of electron acceptor, the pH, and the temperature, could lead to even higher thiosulfate concentrations.
3. **Investigate the use of biogenic thiosulfate for the recovery of other PGMs.** The current study focused on the recovery of Pd from spent synthetic catalysts. However, biogenic thiosulfate could also be used to recover other PGMs, such as Pt, Rh, and Ir, from a variety of sources.
4. **Develop a pilot-scale biogenic thiosulfate production and PGM recovery system.** The current study was conducted at a laboratory scale. However, a pilot-scale system would be necessary to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach for commercial applications.
5. **Investigate the environmental impacts of the biogenic thiosulfate production and PGM recovery process.** The current study did not assess the environmental impacts of the proposed approach. However, a life cycle assessment would be necessary to evaluate the environmental benefits and drawbacks of the process compared to conventional PGM recovery methods.
