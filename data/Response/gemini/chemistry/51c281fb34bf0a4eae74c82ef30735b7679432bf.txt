1. **Investigate the synergistic effects of the isolated compounds.** The paper only tested the individual compounds for their antioxidant and biological activities. However, it would be interesting to see how the compounds work together in combination. This could lead to the development of more effective natural antioxidants and skin care products.
2. **Study the bioavailability and metabolism of the isolated compounds.** The paper does not provide any information on the bioavailability or metabolism of the isolated compounds. This information is important for understanding how the compounds will behave in the body and for designing effective delivery systems.
3. **Explore the potential of the isolated compounds for treating other diseases.** The paper only tested the isolated compounds for their antioxidant and skin care properties. However, it is possible that the compounds may have other therapeutic benefits. For example, they could be investigated for their anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, or anti-microbial activities.
4. **Develop new methods for extracting and purifying the isolated compounds.** The paper used traditional methods for extracting and purifying the isolated compounds. However, there may be more efficient and cost-effective methods available. Developing new methods could make the compounds more accessible for use in commercial products.
5. **Investigate the potential of the isolated compounds for use in food preservation.** The paper only tested the isolated compounds for their antioxidant and skin care properties. However, it is possible that the compounds could also be used to preserve food. This could lead to the development of new natural food preservatives that are safe and effective.
