    "abstractText": "Though conserved in higher plants, the WOX transcription factors play crucial roles in plant growth and development of Melastoma dodecandrum Lour., which shows pioneer position in land ecosystem formation and produces nutritional fruits. Identifying the WOX family genes in M. dodecandrum is imperative for elucidating its growth and development mechanisms. However, the WOX genes in M. dodecandrum have not yet been characterized. In this study, by identification 22 WOX genes in M. dodecandrum based on current genome data, we classified family genes into three clades and nine types with homeodomains. We highlighted gene duplications of MedWOX4, which offered evidences of whole-genome duplication events. Promoter analysis illustrated that cisregulatory elements related to light and stress responses and plant growth were enriched. Expression pattern and RT-qPCR results demonstrated that the majority of WOX genes exhibited expression in the stem. MedWOX13s displayed highest expression across various tissues. MedWOX4s displayed a specific expression in the stem. Collectively, our study provided foundations for elucidating WOX gene functions and further molecular design breeding in M. dodecandrum.",

            "text": "WUSCHEL related homeobox (WOX) Transcription Factors (TFs) belong to the homeodomain superfamily of transcription factors. They contain a homeodomain that folds into a DNA-binding domain formed by 60 to 66 amino acid residues [1]. In Arabidopsis thaliana L., 15 WOX genes that participate in regulating early embryonic development have been identified. Phylogenetic analysis has categorized WOX genes into three evolutionary clades: ancient, intermediate and WUS [1\u20133]. However, plants with different taxonomic positions had different WOX branches. Ostreococcus tauri C. Courties & M.-J. contains only ancient clade, and this clade is found to be expanded in mosses [4]. In fern plants, WOX intermediate clade related genes were found to exist, such as in Ceratopteris richardii Brongn. [5] Whereas in higher seed plants, WUS clade WOX proteins were found to be present [6]. Melastoma dodecandrum Lour. is a creeping shrub widely distributed across southern China [7\u20139]. A pioneer species is a type of plant, fungus, or organism that is among the first to colonize or inhabit a newly formed or disturbed habitat [10]. As a pioneer plant, M. dodecandrum possesses typical advantages of pioneer species [11]. The stems of M. dodecandrum have numerous adventitious roots, which can help it adapt more easily to new habitats. A pioneer plant also can profoundly influence the growth environment and\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 17349. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242417349 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 17349 2 of 17\necosystem [12,13]. Additionally, pioneer plants play important roles in plant community succession and ecotones, with many pioneer herbaceous plants being major agricultural weeds [14]. WOX genes can regulate shoot apical meristem formation and promote differentiation or maintenance of the vascular procambium [15,16]. Therefore, WOX genes may be related to the growth of plant stems. The presence of adventitious roots in M. dodecandrum\u2019s stems enables them to anchor to the ground, leading to a creeping growth habit. Investigating WOX genes in M. dodecandrum is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms behind plant creeping growth and the emergence of pioneer plants. Previous studies have demonstrated that WOX genes play an important role in plant growth and development. In Rosa canina L., RcWOX1 play a pivotal role in auxin induced rhizoid formation [17]. WOX5 interacts with WOX1 and WOX3 to control leaf shape in A. thaliana [18]. WOX6 and WOX11 regulate Oryza sativa L. tillering angle through auxin [19]. WOX7 has been reported to regulate lateral root development and WOX2 and WOX8 involve early embryonic development in A. thaliana [20,21]. NsWOX9 in Nicotiana sylvestris Speg. interacts with LAMINA1 to regulate cytokinin levels, thereby regulating cell proliferation and differentiation [22]. OsWOX10 involves the timely initiation and growth of rice roots [23]. WOX11 played a mediating role in SLG2, allowing SLG2 to specifically regulate grain width [24]. WOX11/12 enhance salt tolerance in poplar tree by activating the PagCYP736A12 gene [25] And the WOX14 stimulates vascular cell differentiation and lignification in A. thaliana stems [26]. Moreover, The WUS/WOX genes could interact with ICDH, influencing plant stem cell maintenance in response to nutrient deficiency. It also could interact with FINS1 to respond to fructose signaling [27,28]. WUS affects the development of plant embryos, bud meristem and reproductive organs [29]. WOX4 and WOX13 are key members of the WOX gene family that play vital roles in regulating plant growth. In Liriodendron hybrids, LCWOX4 expression restricts to the vascular tissues of cotyledon embryos [30]. Silencing of GhWOX4 retards the growth and development of Gossypium hirsutum L. [31,32]. WOX13 regulates plant stem cell growth, initiates callus formation, facilitates organ reconnection and negatively regulates shoot apical meristem formation from callus in A. thaliana [16,33,34]. The number of WOX genes varies across plant species. For example, 18 WOX genes are identified in Helianthus annuus L. [35], 14 in Triticum aestivum L. [36] and 9\u201314 members in Rosaceae species [37]. Additionally, the WOX gene family of many plants was discussed, such as Gossypium, Rosaceae species, Pinus sylvestris L. and Raphanus sativus L. [38\u201341] Although the roles of WOXs have been well-studied in a lot of plants, little is known about their function in pioneer plant. Therefore, we systematically identified and analyzed the characteristics of WOX genes of M. dodecandrum, including gene structures, conserved domains, phylogenetic tree, homologous and repetitive genes, cis-regulatory elements and expression patterns. We hope our research findings can provide novel insights into the study of plant creeping growth and pioneer plants."

The 65 WOX proteins were well clustered into three branches, including the ancient clade, intermediate clade and WUS clade [1] (Figure 1). The number of WOX proteins varies among different branches, with the largest number in the WOX4 branch, including four members (MedWOX4a, MedWOX4b, MedWOX4c and MedWOX4d). Contrarily, A. thaliana and N. sylvestris have only one member each, while E. japonica has two members. There was only one member in WUS and WOX2 branches of M. dodecandrum. Among the WOX proteins in M. dodecandrum, WUS clade has the most members, with 14, while ancient clade has only three members. In order to further understand the evolutionary relationship between duplicated and non-duplicated WOX genes, we selected 12 species of WOX4 (duplicated in M. dodecandrum), WUS (non-duplicated in M. dodecandrum) protein sequences and chloroplast conserved genes (Table S2) to construct The Maximum Likelihood tree (Figure 5). The ML tree results of WOX4 showed that they were clustered into dicotyledons, monocots, and ANA grade branches based on species classification status (Figure 5B). There was a certain discrepancy between this result and the ML tree based on the chloroplast genes (Figure 5C). In addition, the MedWOX4 branch, containing the largest number of genes in the M. dodecandrum WOX family, showed evidence of expansion. The phylogenetic tree results showed that MedWOX4 was clustered to the junction of dicotyledonous WOX4s and monocotyledonous WOX4s. MedWOX4b, MedWOX4c, and MedWOX4d clustered to dicotyledonous WOX4s.

The WOX genes were highly expressed in the stem and entire inflorescence. Most of the genes showed low expression in long and short stamens, with some expression in pistils, sepals, petals, and fruits. Transcriptome data revealed that MedWOX13a, MedWOX13b, and MedWOX13c were highly expressed in flowers, fruits, leaves, roots, and stems. MedWOX13b showing high expression in all tested plant organs and plant parts. MedWOX4b was expressed in flower buds, sepals, medium-sized fruits, leaves, roots, and stems. with particularly high expression in leaves, roots, and stems. In contrast, MedWOX4a, MedWOX4c, and MedWOX4d were predominantly expressed in stems. MedWOX2, MedWOX5, MedWOX11b, and MedWUS showed low expression in all tissues. MedWOX9a and MedWOX9b were highly expressed in pistils and fruits. Interestingly, most of the WOX genes were expressed in the stem, with relatively high expression levels observed for MedWOX3a, MedWOX4b, MedWOX13a, and MedWOX13b. Gene expression clustering analysis (Figure 8B) of different plant organs and plant parts revealed that MedWOX4b exhibited a significant increase in expression in both leaves and stems (cluster 4). Meanwhile, MedWOX4a, MedWOX4c, and MedWOX4d showed a noticeable increase in expression in the stem (clusters 5 and 6). The expression levels of MedWOX13s were consistently moderate across most of the tissues (cluster 1). In addition, MedWOX3a, MedWOX3c, MedWOX5, MedWOX7, and MedWOX11a also exhibited a similar expression trend in clusters 5 and 6. These results have shown that MedWOXs, especially MedWOX4s and MedWOX13s, potential involvement in the stem growth and development of M. dodecandrum.

            "text": "The homeodomain is a typical structural domain of the WOX TFs [1], which are widely present in higher plants and play important roles in plant growth and development. In three cotton species, Gossypium arboreum Linn., G. raimondii Ulbr., and G. hirsutum L., 26, 31, and 50 (NAU)/33 (BJI) WOX genes were identified, respectively [42]. In Brassica rapa L. and B. oleracea L., 25 and 29, WOX genes were identified, respectively [43]. B. napus L. contains 58 WOX genes, which are classified into three main branches [44]. There were 15 WOX genes in A. thaliana. Only 11 WOX genes are identified in Citrus sinensis Pers. [45]. In this study, we identified 22 WOX genes with homeodomains from the entire genome of M. dodecandrum and divided them into three branches (ancient clade, intermediate clade, and WUS clade) (Figure 1). It can be seen that the number of WOX gene family members varies in different plants, which may be due to the preservation of WOX genes suitable for their own growth and development during plant evolution. The gene structure results indicate that the WOX gene family in M. dodecandrum has unique motifs, including motif8, motif2, and motif1. Different clades also have their own unique motifs. For example, the ancient clade has motif3, motif6, and motif10 that were not present in other clades. And the intermediate clade has unique motif4. This suggests that WOX genes in different clades may have different functions. Gene duplication can promote the evolution of plant gene function, but it can also drive the emergence of new protein oligomeric states [46,47]. Segmental duplication and tandem duplication are the main mechanisms of gene family expansion. In order to elucidate the amplification of genes, we performed synteny analysis using TBtools software (version 1.120). A total of 15 pairs of segmental duplications were identified in MedWOX gene family, and no tandem duplication were found. Therefore, segmental duplication may be the main reason for the expansion of MedWOX gene family (Figure 6). Cis-regulatory element analysis is important for studying gene function, agronomic traits and plant metabolism [48]. Our promoter analysis uncovered that the promoter region of the M. dodecandrum WOX gene contains a large number of light and stress response-related elements (G-box, LTR), elements associated with MeJA and abscisic acid (CGTCA-motif, TGACG-motif, and ABRE), as well as elements related to plant growth (CAT-box and O2-site). Among these elements, G-box, CGTCA-motif, TGACG-motif, and ABRE were the most abundant (Figure 7). MeJA is an important hormone for plants to respond to biotic and abiotic stress, while abscisic acid plays a crucial role in response to salt and drought stress, regulating seed dormancy and plant growth and development [49\u201351]. These results suggest the MedWOX genes likely play roles in the response to the light, stress and plant growth of M. dodecandrum. WOX genes play a crucial role in regulating stem cell growth and development, controlling leaf growth, and promoting root formation [52\u201354]. WOX4 gene is a member of the WUS clade. It has been reported to be expressed in the vasculature of roots and stems in A. thaliana and Solanum lycopersicum L., and may promote differentiation and maintenance of the vascular procambium [15]. In Populus trees(Populus tremula L. \u00d7 P. tremuloides Michx and P. alba L. \u00d7 P. glandulosa Moench clone 84K), ubiquitinated PagDA1 can antagonize PagWOX4 in a common pathway to regulate cambial activity. PttWOX4 gene can control cell division activity in the vascular cambium, thus promoting stem growth [55,56]. However, only one or two WOX4 genes have been identified in many species, such as A.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 17349 12 of 17\nthaliana, Paper Mulberry(Broussonetia kazinoki Siebold \u00d7 B. papyrifera (L.) Vent.) [57], and Bambusoideae [58]. In this study, Our phylogenetic analysis categorized the 22 identified MedWOX genes into three branches and nine types. Among them, the MedWOX4 type has four members (MedWOX4a, MedWOX4b, MedWOX4c, MedWOX4d) (Figure 1). This suggests that WOX4 gene have undergone significant expansion in M. dodecandrum, which may be related to the whole-genome duplication events that M. dodecandrum experienced [59]. Transcriptome data and RT-qPCR results showed that MedWOX4a, MedWOX4b, MedWOX4c and MedWOX4d were all expressed in different parts of M. dodecandrum, while the expression of the four genes was relatively high in the stem (Figure 8). We speculate that the amplification of MedWOX4 may be related to the growth of the stem of M. dodecandrum. The ancient clade was typically found in lower plants, while members of the WUS clade and intermediate clade have differentiated from members of the ancient clade that underwent expansion during evolution [60]. Plant evolution may also promote gene evolution. The results of the single-gene phylogenetic tree showed that the WOX4 and WUS genes cluster well according to ANA-grade, dicotyledons and monocots(Figure 5A,B). WOX4 underwent duplicattion during the evolutionary process of M. dodecandrum. But the duplicated MedWOX4 and the non-duplicated MedWUS were found to occupy similar positions in the phylogenetic tree. This indicates that when a species evolved to a certain extent, it may have driven the evolution of the WOX gene. This allows the WOX gene to reflect a certain position in species evolution. However, whether the gene is replicated or not has little impact on the position of WOX in the phylogenetic tree. Constructing a phylogenetic tree based on chloroplast genes to illustrate the evolutionary position of species is a highly credible approach. The results of the single-gene phylogenetic tree have a slight difference when compared to the results obtained from the chloroplast gene phylogenetic tree (Figure 5C). The results of the single-gene phylogenetic tree has a little difference when compared to the results obtained from the chloroplast gene phylogenetic tree (Figure 5C). The discordance between the single-gene ML tree and chloroplast gene ML tree highlights the limitations of using phylogenies of individual genes to analyze gene evolution. Previous studies found that WOX13 regulated plant stem cell growth and promoted plant callus, organ growth and development [33,34]. GhWOX13a and GhWOX13b showed higher expression in the roots and stems, with specific expression in cotton fibers (G. hirsutum) [61]. PgWOX13a and PgWOX13b were detected in the thin-walled cells of the main root and cultured adventitious roots of Panax ginseng C.A.Mey. seedlings, indicating their important role in maintaining the differentiation and self-renewal of the cortex and xylem [62]. A recent study showed that WOX13 could regulate WUS and negatively regulated the expression of regulators in shoot meristem, thus affecting shoot regeneration [16]. Those findings of these studies suggest that WOX13 plays a crucial role in regulating the growth of plant stems and buds. Therefore, elucidating the precise mechanisms underlying the function of WOX13 could provide valuable insights into the adaptive strategies employed by pioneer species to thrive in novel habitats. Based on transcriptomic data and RT-qPCR results, we found that MedWOX13a, MedWOX13b, and MedWOX13c were highly expressed in flowers, fruits, leaves, roots, and stems (Figure 8), similar to previous studies. Those are the indispensable important organs in plants. It showed that the MedWOX13s play an important role in growth and development of M. dodecandrum. It should be noted that MedWOX13s was similar to MedWOX4s in that they had higher expression in the stems. This suggested the MedWOX13s and MedWOX4s may have played a role in promoting stem growth. This may help the adventitious roots on the stems of M. dodecandrum to better set on land, thereby promoting the rapid spread and prostrate establishment of M. dodecandrum in new habitats However, further investigations are required to substantiate this hypothesis.\nInt.

Our analysis encompassed the physicochemical properties, conserved domains, gene structure, sequence and synteny analysis and so forth of the WOX genes in M. dodecandrum. We constructed phylogenetic trees of M. dodecandrum with A. thaliana, E. japonica, and N. sylvestris, as well as single-gene phylogenetic trees of WOX4 and WOX13 in twelve plants. Notably, we observed substantial expansion of the WOX4 clade in M. dodecandrum. Promoter element prediction indicated that the WOX genes of M. dodecandrum may be associated with light and stress response and plant growth. Based on transcriptomic and RT-qPCR data, The WOX genes, especially MedWOX4 and MedWOX13, had high expression in the stems of M. dodecandrum and MedWOX4 expressed specifically in the stem. This suggested that these genes may be related to stem growth. The growth of the stems could have helped the adventitious roots of the M. dodecandrum to anchor better, contributing to its creeping growth habit. These findings provide potential research directions for unraveling the role of WOX transcription factors in plant growth and development.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms242417349/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Y.Z., K.Z., D.P. and Z.-J.L.: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software; R.Z. and S.A.: Data curation, Writing\u2014Original draft preparation, Writing\u2014Reviewing and Editing.
