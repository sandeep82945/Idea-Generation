    "abstractText": "Citrus fruits have been the subject of extensive research over the years due to their impressive antioxidant properties, the health benefits of flavanones, and their potential use in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. Grapefruit have been shown in studies to improve overall health, with numerous potential benefits, including improved heart health, reduced risk of certain cancers, improved digestive health, and improved immune system function. The development of cyclodextrin complexes is an exciting approach to increasing the content of flavanones such as naringin and naringenin in the extraction medium while improving the profile of beneficial phenolic compounds and the antioxidant profile. This research aims to optimize the extraction conditions of the flavanones naringin and naringenin with additional compounds to increase their yield from different parts of grapefruit (Citrus \u00d7 paradisi L.) fruits, such as albedo and segmental membranes. In addition, the total content of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and the antioxidant activity of ethanolic extracts produced conventionally and with -cyclodextrin was examined and compared. In addition, antioxidant activity was measured using the radical scavenging activity assay (ABTS), radical scavenging activity assay (DPPH), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) methods. The yield of naringin increased from 10.53 \u00b1 0.52 mg/g to 45.56 \u00b1 5.06 mg/g to 51.11 \u00b1 7.63 mg/g of the segmental membrane when cyclodextrins (\u03b1, \u03b2-CD) were used; naringenin increased from 65.85 \u00b1 10.96 \u03bcg/g to 91.19 \u00b1 15.19 \u03bcg/g of the segmental membrane when cyclodextrins (\u03b1, \u03b2-CD) were used. Furthermore, the results showed that cyclodextrin-assisted extraction had a significant impact in significantly increasing the yield of flavanones from grapefruit. In addition, the process was more efficient and less expensive, resulting in higher yields of flavanones with a lower concentration of ethanol and effort. This shows that cyclodextrin-assisted extraction is an excellent method for extracting valuable compounds from grapefruit.",

Epidemiological studies have shown that consumers of polyphenolic compounds are less susceptible to chronic diseases [1,2].

Due to the great pharmacological potential of citrus fruits, flavonoids and phenolic chemicals are the most studied biologically active molecules in the pharmaceutical field.\nNutrients 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 22\nthis perspective, the fruits of Citrus x paradisi L. are rich in physiologically active components such as phenolic compounds, vitamins, carotenoid pigments, and fiber [3]. Grapefruit (Citrus x paradisi L.) is one of the world\u2019s most popular fruits. In Eastern medicine, it is used as an appetite stimulant, antidiarrheal, emetic, and expectorant to treat flatulence, scurvy, acne, and eczema [4].

Due to the great pharmacological potential of citrus fruits, flavonoids and phenolic chemicals are the most studied biologically active molecules in the pharmaceutical field. Two of the most important flavanones in grapefruit fruits are naringin and narirutin [10]. Naringenin (5,7,4\u2032-trihydroxy flavanone), a polyphenolic flavonoid, is an aglycone derivative of hydrogenated flavone [11]. The bacteria of the gut microbiome convert naringin into active naringenin [12]. This flavonoid molecule is an essential part of the human diet and responsible for our foods\u2019 color and bitter\u2013sour taste.\nFigure 1. The effects of grapefruit (Citrus x paradisi L.) and the main flavonoids found in its extracts.\nThe anticancer, antiproliferative, and antitumor effects of naringenin are based on its DNA repair ability [13,14]. It has inhibited breast, liver, prostate, melanoma, and spinal cord glioblastoma cells. Naringenin also influences the intrinsic (mitochondrial) and extrinsic (receptor) apoptotic pathways. The effect of naringenin on apoptosis inhibits proliferation and angiogenesis [15]. Naringenin reduces leukocyte accumulation by inhibiting macrophages\u2019 chemotaxis molecules, which draw leukocytes to inflammation [14,16]. In addition, it activates NFE2\u2013related factor 2 (Nrf2), an anti-inflammatory factor, in macrophages which is another way it influences. It can also reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-33, TNF-, IL1, and IL-6, suppressing nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u0138B) activation [17], boosting antioxidant ability, and reducing superoxide anions and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) [18]. Antidiabetic activity: Studies conducted in vitro and in vivo show that naringenin is essential in preventing and treating insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes [6]. This bioflavonoid can reduce the amount of glucose absorbed by the intestinal brush and the amount of sugar stored in the kidneys [19]. In addition, naringenin improves glucose uptake and utilization and contributes to glucose reabsorption by muscle and adipose tissue. According to the research, naringenin stimulates the growth of pancreatic cells, which has a beneficial effect. These cells have enhanced glucose-sensing abilities because of their training. It has been hypothesized that naringenin causes pancreatic cells to be more sensitive to the effects of glucose and has a pro-apoptotic effect on these cells [12]. Naringenin reduces inflammation caused by phenyl-\u03b2-benzoquinone, acetic acid, formalin, capsaicin, carrageenan, and superoxide anions [20].

Naringenin reduces inflammation caused by phenyl-\u03b2-benzoquinone, acetic acid, formalin, capsaicin, carrageenan, and superoxide anions [20]. This bioflavonoid also possesses antinociceptive and analgesic properties in vivo. Naringenin also regulates transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in nociceptors. Hence, it helps in analgesia [21]. Antibiotic resistance is a global problem. Bacteria are resistant to all groups of antibiotics [22]. The use of antibiotics in the food, veterinary, and medical industries has\nNutrients 2023, 15, 1276 3 of 21\nraised this concern. Overprescribing antibiotics to asymptomatic patients, the COVID-19 pandemic, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have worsened this situation. Acinetobacter Baumann, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and beta-lactam-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia result from overuse. Naringenin kills Gram-positive bacteria, including S. aureus and MRSA [23,24]. However, only a few clinical studies are using this bioflavonoid as an antibiotic. Unfortunately, neither the US nor the EU databases have registered any clinical trials, so these results are unavailable. Pharmacological safety is shown at 900 mg [25]. Flavanones are also liver protective. Naringenin reduces hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and gluconeogenesis [26], reduces triglyceride formation, and significantly reduces low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and triglycerides in diabetic mice. Furthermore, based on articles, naringenin increased high-density lipoproteins (HDL) levels in Wistar albino rats [19,27]. Antioxidant activity in the traditional sense is identified by the hydroxy substituents (OH) on their molecules showing a high reactivity towards reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) [5,22,28]. Because of this, the ability of a given molecule to function as an antioxidant increases when that molecule contains OH radicals; in the case of naringenin, there are three of these residues. After this, OH donates its hydrogen to free radicals (R), eventually stabilizing naringenin by resonance. Ring B is an essential part of the typical structure of flavonoids. This is because when hydroxyl groups are present in the ring, flavonoids can stabilize hydroxyl (OH), peroxyl (ROO), and peroxynitrite (ONOO) radicals, thereby forming relatively stable flavonoid radicals (Figure 2) [29,30].\nNutrients 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 22\npossesses antinociceptive and analgesic properties in vivo.

They measure the absorption of the reaction mixture in the visible spectrum. These methods are fast, simple, and reliable but lack chromatographic selectivity. Colorimetric techniques are used to quantify phenolic compounds based on their abundance and the complexity of the plant matrix [32]. One of these methods is that of Folin\u2013Ciocalteu, which uses a specific reagent composed of several chemicals (sodium molybdate, sodium tungstate, etc.) [33]. The method is based on electron transfer reactions. However, the method requires a reference substance (in this case, gallic acid) to measure the total phenolic content of the extract. Next, the method with aluminum chloride (AlCl3) is used to test the total amount of flavonoids. These forms chelate complexes of aluminum and flavonoids [34]. DPPH (2,2- diphenyl1-picrylhydrazyl), ABTS (2,2\u2032-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid),\nNutrients 2023, 15, 1276 4 of 21\nand FRAP (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power) are spectrophotometric techniques for the preliminary testing of the antioxidant activity of plant extracts [35,36]. ABTS uses ABTS\u2022+, a stable blue-green radical with a maximum absorbance of 734 nm. Before use, allow the ABTS solution and potassium persulfate (K2S2O8) to react in the dark at room temperature for 12\u201316 h to generate the ABTS radical cation. Next, this ion reacts with phenolic chemicals to change the blue color to greenish or colorless. Data are Trolox equivalents [34]. The FRAP method is comparable to the ABTS and DPPH methods; however, the reaction is carried out in an acidic medium. The effectiveness of the antioxidant in reducing Fe (III) in an acidic solution is the focus of this approach [35]. Pharmacologically active chemicals usually contain excipients. Excipients help in the formulation of drugs, and they increase drug stability, dosage uniformity, and bioavailability [36]. Cyclodextrins are composed of a ring of glucose molecules linked in a specific arrangement. The structure creates a cavity within the molecule, which can be used to bind to other molecules. This property makes cyclodextrins useful for drug delivery, as they can bind to drugs and deliver them to the desired location in the body. Additionally, cyclodextrins have a high degree of solubility in water, which makes them useful for water purification applications. Another property of cyclodextrins is their ability to form complexes with other molecules. This property makes them useful for food processing applications, as they can be used to bind to food additives and other compounds to improve their stability and shelf life. Additionally, cyclodextrins can be used to bind to flavors and aromas, which can be used to enhance the flavor and aroma of food products. Cyclodextrins (CDs) form inclusion complexes in aqueous solutions, making them suitable for assisted extraction. Lipophilic guest molecules or fragments reside within these inclusion complexes [37], so complexation can increase flavanone solubility and antioxidant properties [38]. In addition, CDs decrease the taste of naringin generations and decrease their interaction with intestinal CYP3A4 metabolized drugs [39]. The most common types of cyclodextrins are \u03b1-CD, \u03b2-CD, and \u03b3-CD, which contain six, seven, and eight glucopyranose units, respectively (Figure 3).\nNutrients 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 22\ncompounds based on their abundance and the complexity of the plant matrix [32].

The temperature of the column was set at 25 \u00b0C. Peaks were found by comparing the UV-Vis spectra of each peak to valid reference standards and measuring their retention times. The samples were subjected to two different analyses. The chromatograms of the standards for naringenin, naringin, and narirutin are shown in Figure 7.\nThe Methodological Review of Natural Products by Wolfender (2009) [29,46] was used for quantification and validation. Standard stock solutions with primary concentrations of 100 \u00b5g/mL of naringin, narirutin, and naringenin were prepared in 70% methanol, and calibration curves were constructed using six standard solution concentrations. Three injections per concentration were performed to determine linearity. To construct calibration equations, naringin, naringenin, and narirutin were plotted against known concentrations of the respective standard solutions. The least squares approach was used to calculate a linear regression equation. The regression coefficients of all calibration curves were R2 > 0.999, confirming the linearity of the concentration ranges. The sensitivity of the approach was determined by determining the limit of detection (LOD) and the quantification (LOQ). The concentrations that produced a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 and 10, respectively, were used to determine LOD and LOQ. A standard mixture of naringin, naringenin, and narirutin was used during the intraday and inter-day precision testing. Five repeated non-consecutive injections of the regular combination on the same day on four different days proved the method\u2019s accuracy. Relative standard deviation (RSD) is used to describe the results. The retention times and spectra of standards (naringin, naringenin, and narirutin) were compared to those prepared in extracts in this work. Linearity was determined by calculating the correlation coefficient R2 of the calibration curve (naringin R2 = 0.99992, naringenin R2 = 0.99992, narirutin R2 = 0.99999) and the peak areas were used for quantification. The linearity range of naringin was 1.166 to 33.34 \u00b5g/mL, 0.472 to 15.12 \u00b5g/mL for naringenin, and 1.2757 to 80.5 \u00b5g/mL for narirutin. The concentrations of naringenin, naringin, and narirutin were expressed as \u00b5g/g, mg/g, and mg/g dry weight (DW), respectively (Table 2).\nNutrients 2023, 15, 1276 8 of 21"

            "text": "The structure of cyclodextrins (CD) can explain the increased yield of flavanones in the extracts from plant material. Additionally, the CD encapsulation can change the physicochemical features, such as water solubility and the substance\u2019s stability [36]. CDs can protect chemically unstable drug molecules from environmental factors, reducing or preventing drug hydrolysis, oxidation, and enzymatic degradation. One common application is reducing bitterness in citrus fruit juice by forming a naringin-\u03b2CD complex [38]. The research of Pereira et al. in 2021 revealed that by using inclusion complexes, an impressive conversion rate from naringin to naringenin could be achieved, reaching up to 98.7% and 56.2%. On top of this remarkable success, \u03b2-CD has been noted as having a positive effect on water solubility; therefore, enzymatic hydrolysis of naringin will likely improve significantly [44]. Based on previous studies, we picked the albedo and segmental membrane parts for our investigation. The most significant quantities of naringenin were detected using combination extraction methods (ultrasonic extraction method with thermal hydrolysis). Due to its polarity for flavonoids, research shows that methanol, among other organic solvents, is exceptionally capable of extraction. Because of this, efforts are being undertaken to find non-toxic and entirely biodegradable alternatives, such as ethanol, that can produce the same or similar outcomes without harming the environment [52,53]. The primary goal was to improve the flavanone yield in the extract; an organic solvent was chosen as a co-solvent with CDs because aglycones are more hydrophobic than hydrophilic chemicals and have limited solubility in water. As a result, once the combination with CD degrades, flavanone deposits might develop in water. This procedure may be avoided by using an organic solvent. In control, the maximum level of naringenin was detected in the part of the segmental membrane using 70% ethanol (67.59 \u00b1 3.37 \u00b5g/g). By using cyclodextrins, this amount could be increased by more than 34%. Comparing \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3-cyclodextrins, a statistically significant increase was observed in the AA1 sample (\u03b1-CDS, 50% ethanol v/v) 43.44 \u00b1 2.17 \u00b5g/g compared to AT1 (23.58 \u00b1 1.17 \u00b5g/g), AB1 (16.21 \u00b1 0.81 \u00b5g/g), AG1 (0.84 \u00b1 0.042 \u00b5g/g), and SA1 (91.19 \u00b1 4.55 \u00b5g/g) compared to ST1 (65.84 \u00b1 3.29 \u00b5g/g) and SB1 (0.45 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b5g/g).\nNutrients 2023, 15, 1276 11 of 21\nThe results of our samples concluded that the combination of naringenin and \u03b1-CD with the smallest cavity size provided a higher yield of the aglycone compared to other cyclodextrins. Statistical analysis indicated that this significant increase was remarkable (p < 0.05). According to the results of our research, 50% ethanol generated a higher concentration of naringenin than 70% (v/v) ethanol using \u03b1-CD: (AA1) 43.44 \u00b1 2.17 \u00b5g/g\u2013(AA2) 28.77 \u00b1 1.44 \u00b5g/g from albedo, and (SA1) 91.19 \u00b1 4.55 \u00b5g/g\u2013(SA2) 86.69 \u00b1 4.33 \u00b5g/g from segmental membrane parts, (50% and 70%, respectively).

The concentration of flavonoids varies depending on the plant\u2019s development stage since they are the most abundant group of chemicals found in plants and substantially influence the plant when growing. The majority of flavonoids, also known as flavanone glycosides, are only found in citrus trees. Other types of plants have very few of these compounds. Grapefruit contains several flavonoid glycosides, the most important of which are naringin, hesperidin, and narirutin [34,52]. Flavonoids are abundant in various parts of the fruit, resulting in significant differences between fruit types. Another study found that fruit parts and cultures had different total flavonoid levels. For example, the peel has values between 5.12 mg and 8.30 mg per gram fresh weight; the pulp can range from 3.86 to 5.38 mg/g, from 0.26 to 0.44 mg/g in juice, from 3.16 to 9.27 mg/g in whole fruits and from 18, 61 to 25.33 mg/g in seeds. As a result, seeds contained more flavonoids than juices (5496 times as much as the juice) [57]. Nurcholis et al. investigated the effects of extraction procedures and durations on total flavonoid and phenolic contents (TFCs and TPCs) in a solvent such as methanol. According to the researchers, different extraction procedures and durations significantly influenced the TFCs, TPCs, and antioxidant activities of Java cardamom fruit methanol extracts [58].

The TFC ranged from 1.26 \u00b1 0.08 to 4.91 \u00b1 0.24 mg RE/g DW. Flavedo extracts had the highest flavonoid levels (2.52 \u00b1 0.13 mg RE/g DW).

The antioxidant capacity of plant extracts can be affected by a wide variety of factors, including the extraction process, the solvent used, the kind of fruit, and the stage of ripeness at which the fruit was harvested [60]. Consequently, we decided to assess the number of antioxidants present in grapefruit using different methods (radical scavenging, antioxidant activity, and reducing power) [61]. Cyclodextrins, for example, can assist overcome the disadvantages of antioxidants in functional foods. In addition, cyclodextrins are also used as anti-browning agents to prevent the enzymatic browning of food. Finally, research shows that cyclodextrins act as secondary antioxidants and help typical antioxidants resist enzymatic browning.

Extracts were extracted using ultrasound (as described in Section 2.4) (control test) and compared to extracts with the addition of \u03b2-cyclodextrins (test sample). To this end, the variation in antioxidant capacity was determined by assessing the effect of cyclodextrin on antioxidant capacity.

The free radical scavenging activity of Citrus \u00d7 paradisi L. extract varied considerably: from 4.36 \u00b1 0.218 \u00b5g TE/g to 18.61 \u00b1 0.93 \u00b5g TE/g. The highest ABTS radical-cation binding activity was observed in fresh grapefruit juice at 18.61 \u00b1 0.93 \u00b5g TE/g. In this study, all test samples developed using CDs had significantly increased antioxidant activity than the control samples. In the sample with flavedo (from 8.97 \u00b1 0.448 \u00b5g TE/g to 18.61 \u00b1 0.93 \u00b5g TE/g) and fresh juice (from 18.61 \u00b1 0.93 \u00b5g TE/g to 20.56 \u00b1 1.028 \u00b5g TE/g), the highest binding of the ABTS radical showed (Figure 15).

Combinations with reducing power imply that they are electron donors and can decrease the oxidized intermediates produced during the process of lipid peroxidation, functioning as both primary and secondary antioxidants [63]. It was discovered by Gupta et al., who investigated two distinct harvests of pomelo fruit, that the flavedo of the fruit had the highest antioxidant capacity and FRAP activity. On the other hand, the albedo of the fruit was found to have the highest accumulation of naringin. These findings were based on the findings that the flavedo of the fruit had the highest antioxidant capacity and FRAP activity. On the other hand, pomelo juice showed the most increased DPPH free-radical scavenging activity and the highest tannin concentration [59]. The results of a FRAP experiment that was conducted on various grapefruit components may be found in Figure 16. Compared to their capacity to scavenge free radicals, the ability of some samples to reduce iron ions (Fe3\u207a) to iron ions (Fe2\u207a) was significantly more impressive. Applying \u03b2-CD resulted in a one- to two-fold increase in the ethanol samples\u2019 reduction power. In this investigation, the outcomes of the test samples (which had \u03b2CDs) were noticeably superior to those of the control samples (devoid of \u03b2-CD). The spectrophotometric FRAP method determined that fresh grapefruit juice and extracts from the flavedo showed the highest reducing activity among the tested extracts, and the lowest reducing activity was found in the segmental membrane. The use of \u03b2cyclodextrins showed statistically significant results in all tested extracts. In some samples, the reductive activity doubled; for example, the sample from flavedo parts increased reduction from 10.44 \u00b1 0.522 \u03bcg TE/g to 20.44 \u00b1 1.02 \u03bcg TE/g.

In the culinary, nutraceutical, and medicinal industries, increasing the naturally occurring flavanone aglycones in fruit materials may generate new potential for utilizing these beneficial chemicals in various applications. Grapefruit contains many nutrients and biologically active compounds. The results show that grapefruit\u2019s albedo parts and segmental membranes have the highest total content of phenols, naringin, and naringenin. Grapefruit (Citrus \u00d7 paradisi L.) extracts from the fresh juice and flavedo parts have greater levels of antiradical activity. These findings will be beneficial for processing grapefruit and creating products because there is a lack of literature on the phytochemical and taste qualities. According to the findings of this study, discarded fruit parts possess varied qualities and can also be employed to produce high-quality nutritional supplements and medicines.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.B. and J.S.; investigation, J.S., M.M. and J.V.; resources, J.B., P.V. and L.I.; writing\u2014production of the initial draft, J.S.; writing\u2014review and editing, J.B. and J.S.; visualization, J.S.; supervision, J.B.
