            "text": "In a recent editorial published in the Korean Journal of Family Medicine, the author highlighted the role of continuity of care in managing chronic diseases. He rightfully emphasized that the factors affecting the continuity of care might vary depending on the country\u2019s environment or medical system.1) I agree with this point since it is evident that the healthcare systems of First World countries are far more advanced than those of developing ones, especially regarding resources and technological advancement. However, I feel the need to emphasize another indispensable factor, the behavioral aspect\u2014trust issues. Here, I have elaborated on this point by sharing the situation in the Philippines.\nContinuity of care is the process by which the patient and his/her physician-led care team are cooperatively involved in ongoing healthcare management toward the shared goal of high-quality, cost-effective medical care.2) It is essential, especially for chronic diseases, since evidence suggests that continuity of care for patients prevents hospitalizations, reduces health care costs, and may prolong life in some populations.3) While the level of continuity of care differs worldwide generally because of the abovementioned factors, the behavioral aspect vested in healthcare providers, such as family doctors, general practitioners, specialists, and health government officials, also matters greatly. In case of trust issue or lack of confidence due to inappropriate practices or any unusual behavior, Filipino patients usually sever their relationship with their family doctors. One example of malpractice is the unreasonable professional fees collected by doctors during the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Despite the difficult fi-\nnancial situation during this crisis, some doctors collect additional fees, namely \u201cpandemic fee,\u201d even if the patient is a member of a particular health maintenance organization or has active medical insurance. Moreover, some private hospitals also charge patients excessively.4) The current National Health Insurance Program (NHIP) benefit scheme in the Philippines offers benefits on a fee-for-service basis up to a fixed ceiling. However, NHIP beneficiaries are also not entirely free from the financial risk of having to make potentially large outof-pocket payments for inpatient care.5) Another \u201ctrust issue\u201d is some malpractices committed by healthcare personnel. Recently, four doctors and two staff members in hospitals run by the Negros Occidental provincial government are being investigated for alleged medical infractions. The complaints filed at the Department of Health (DOH) involved medical malpractice such as selling medicines in hospitals.6) In another case, the Court of Appeals upheld the decision of a lower court in Cebu ordering two physicians and a community hospital to pay over PhP2 million in damages to an appendectomy patient whose heart stopped during surgery.7) Furthermore, health government officials were also involved in huge controversies that disappointed many Filipinos, resulting in lack of confidence towards medical professionals. An example is the DOH authorized administration of Dengvaxia to schoolchildren. Approximately 2 years after the campaign started, Sanofi, the manufacturer, announced that the vaccine might cause \u201cmore severe disease\u201d in those who have not had previous dengue infection. However, by then, over 800,000 Filipino schoolchildren had been inoculated.8)\nGiven these circumstances involving patients\u2019 \u201ctrust issues\u201d\nDalmacito A. Cordero Jr. \u2022 In Doctors We Trust! Addressing Trust Issues for an Enhanced Continuity of Care\nhttps://doi.org/10.4082/kjfm.22.0166\nwww.kjfm.or.kr 65\nin their health professionals, a higher level of continuity of care is difficult to maintain since a deeper relationship between both parties is not established. Thus, some interventions are needed to recover the trust and to strengthen the bond between patients and health professionals. However, it is imperative that both parties start from the basics, which is fulfilling their respective responsibility. Doctors are responsible for record-keeping, knowing patients\u2019 history, recalling accumulated knowledge, and maintaining confidentiality. Meanwhile, patients are responsible for disclosing personal and health details, transferring information to other practitioners (including new family doctors), and trusting their doctors.9) Both the parties are equally benefitting when they are faithful to their responsibilities. In addition, it is essential to note that the government (or national health insurance) as a policymaker plays a critical role in maintaining the trust between patients and providers in the country. The health policy or system protects the interests of patients while simultaneously promoting their full cooperation with the health providers for a harmonious relationship."
