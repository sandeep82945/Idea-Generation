    "abstractText": "Maxwell interface problems are of great importance in many electromagnetic applications. Unfitted mesh methods are especially attractive in 3D computation as they can circumvent generating complex 3D interface-fitted meshes. However, many unfitted mesh methods rely on non-conforming approximation spaces, which may cause a loss of accuracy for solving Maxwell equations, and the widely-used penalty techniques in the literature may not help in recovering the optimal convergence. In this article, we provide a remedy by developing N\u00e9d\u00e9lec-type immersed finite element spaces with a Petrov-Galerkin scheme that is able to produce optimal-convergent solutions. To establish a systematic framework, we analyze all the H1, H(curl) and H(div) IFE spaces and form a discrete de Rham complex. Based on these fundamental results, we further develop a fast solver using a modified Hiptmair-Xu preconditioner which works for both the GMRES and CG methods.",

Introduction. Efficient and accurate computation ofH(curl) interface problems is of great importance since many applications involve multiple media with different electromagnetic properties. For example, when designing electromagnetic motors and actuators for electric drive vehicles, one must consider the metal-air or metal-metal interface of rotary objects [10, 34]. Another family of critical applications is for non-destructive detection techniques such as EMI sensors, ground-penetrating radar, and Lorentz force eddy current tests [1, 2, 3, 22] that aim to detect buried metallic objects.\nLet u be an electric or magnetic field in a domain \u2126 in R3 that covers multiple subdomains representing media with different electromagnetic properties. For simplicity, we assume there are only two subdomains of \u2126 denoted as \u2126\u00b1 separated by an interface \u0393. Then, the mathematical model for the interface conditions of u at \u0393 can be generally written as\n[u\u00d7 n]\u0393 := u+ \u00d7 n\u2212 u\u2212 \u00d7 n = 0,(1.1a) [(\u03b1 curl u)\u00d7 n]\u0393 := \u03b1+ curl u+ \u00d7 n\u2212 \u03b1\u2212 curl u\u2212 \u00d7 n = 0,(1.1b) [\u03b2u \u00b7 n]\u0393 := \u03b2+u+ \u00b7 n\u2212 \u03b2\u2212u\u2212 \u00b7 n = 0,(1.1c)\nwhere n denotes the normal vector to \u0393 from \u2126\u2212 to \u2126+, and \u03b1 = \u03b1\u00b1 and \u03b2 = \u03b2\u00b1 in \u2126\u00b1 are assumed to be positive piecewise constant functions with different electromagnetic meanings in various situations. In fact, the interface conditions in (1.1) can be interpreted from Hodge star operators, see the discussion in Section 2.2 and particularly Diagram 2.11. In this work, we shall develop IFE spaces to capture those conditions.\nThe interface condition in (1.1) appears in many formulation of Maxwell equations. For example, the following time-dependent curl-curl equation can be used to model an electric field u = E:\n(1.2) utt + \u03c3ut + curl(\u00b5 \u22121 curl u) = Jt\nsubject to some boundary and initial conditions, where , \u03c3, and \u00b5 are the electric permeability, conductivity, and magnetic permeability of the media respectively, and J is the applied current density. Then solving (1.2) at each time step by an implicit method yields the equation\n(1.3) curl(\u03b1 curl u) + \u03b2u = f .\nIn this model, the jump conditions in (1.1) have \u03b1 = \u00b5\u22121 and \u03b2 = \u2206t\u22122 + \u03c3\u2206t\u22121. We refer readers to [15, 25, 29, 43] for details of this formulation. One can also consider a Helmholtz-type equation [27, 26, 44, 56] where the parameters in (1.1) become \u03b1 = \u00b5\u22121r and \u03b2 = \u03ba\n2 r with \u00b5r and r being the relative magnetic and electric permeability.\nIt is widely known that traditional finite element (FE) methods must be applied on geometrically fitted meshes to solve interface problems, but generating a high-quality fitted mesh is non-trivial, especially for the\n\u2217Department of Mathematics, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697, USA.

For complex geometry, a global refinement is needed to generate high-quality meshes, which is expensive. Instead, locally modifying the mesh near the interface is more efficient. For instance, the approach in [27] first generates a background unfitted mesh and further triangulates those interface elements to fit the interface. However, the local refinement cannot guarantee shape regularity or even the maximal angle condition [12]. In particular, for arbitrarily shaped interface surfaces, the so-called slivers having edges nearly coplanar are difficult to be completely removed from tetrahedral meshes [35, 60], which may deteriorate the accuracy. Another approach is to directly use polyhedral meshes to fit the interface which avoids further triangulation [4, 16, 24]. For all these approaches, small edges of anisotropic meshes may make the conditioning of the resulted linear system even worse and pose a severer restriction on the step size for time-dependent problems.\nIn contrast, some special numerical methods are designed for solving interface problems on unfitted meshes which completely avoids the mesh generation issue. Typical examples include penalty-type methods [13, 14, 54], non-matching mesh methods [19, 20, 25, 50] and immersed finite element (IFE) methods to be discussed in this article. Indeed, all these methods have been successfully applied to various interface problems arising from fluid, elasticity, wave propagation, and so on, see [8, 36, 37, 40, 41] and the reference therein. We also refer readers to FDTD methods [69] based on finite difference formulation for Maxwell interface equations.\nThe methodology of IFE methods is to encode the jump conditions in the construction of approximation spaces, i.e., the IFE spaces, which then have optimal approximation capabilities for functions satisfying the related jump conditions. One of its distinguishing features from others is that they inherit the degrees of freedom (DoFs), which is particularly advantageous for the considered H(curl) problems.\nFor almost all the aforementioned unfitted-mesh FEMs, one of the prices paid is the loss of the conformity of the approximation spaces. For example, the interface-penalty methods and non-matching mesh methods employ spaces that are discontinuous across the interface; while the IFE spaces are discontinuous across interface edges/faces. For many situations, the discontinuity can be well-handled by suitable penalties such as the Nitsche\u2019s penalty [13, 53], but it becomes one of the main obstacles for Maxwell-type equations due to the underlying H(curl) space. Here let us briefly explain the issue. Solutions of (1.3) generally admit low regularity especially near the interface [30, 31, 32]. Suppose that u \u2208 Hs(curl; \u2126), s > 0, and an approximation space is non-conforming on a face F , then the penalty h\u22121 \u222b F\n[uh\u00d7n] \u00b7 [vh\u00d7n] ds is generally needed to ensure the stabilization. Then, in the error estimation, one needs the inequality:\n(1.4) h \u22121/2 K \u2016u\u2212 \u03c0Fu\u2016L2(F ) . h s\u22121 K \u2016u\u2016Hs(curl;K),\nwhere \u03c0F is a projection to some polynomial space on F . Note that even for a moderate regularity s = 1, (1.4) immediately leads to a failure of convergence. This issue was first realized in [9] for a mortar FEM on non-matching meshes. It was also observed by the authors in [19, 20] for the Nitsche\u2019s penalty method (see Theorem 2 in [19]) and recently numerically studied in [62] with a realistic example. From the results in the literature, this issue seems to be essential rather than caused by the limitation of analysis techniques.\nSome approaches in the literature can overcome this issue. One is to search for a conforming subspace of the underlying non-conforming space. This is indeed true for standard discontinuous Galerkin (DG) spaces on fitted meshes for Maxwell equations [47, 48] where the analysis is completely different from the standard DG framework. The authors in [50] employ a similar idea to improve the estimate of the mortar FEM, which relies on a \u201cnested mesh\u201d assumption. But since the unfitted mesh methods modify their spaces near the interface, the conforming subspaces may not exist. Without resorting to conformity, another approach is to use the appropriate scaling in the stabilization [4, 17]. In fact, the scaling factor is highly related to the trace spaces of the underlying Sobolev space [11]. For example, if the solution has H1(curl; \u2126) regularity, the scaling factor should be h instead of h\u22121 in (1.4), which can indeed achieve optimal convergence. But for many unfitted mesh methods, such a scaling factor may not yield a stable scheme.\n(1.5)\nR H2(\u03b2; Th) H1(curl, \u03b1, \u03b2; \u2126) H1(div, \u03b1; Th) H1(Th) 0\nR Snh Seh S f h Qh 0\nR S\u0303nh S\u0303eh S\u0303 f h Qh 0\n\u21aa\u2192\nInh\n\u2207\nIeh\ncurl\nIfh\ndiv\n\u03a00\n\u21aa\u2192\n(Inh ) \u22121\n\u2207\n(Ieh) \u22121\ncurl\n(Ifh) \u22121\ndiv\nI\n\u21aa\u2192\nInh\n\u2207\nIeh\ncurl\nIfh\ndiv\nI\nTherefore, it would be highly desirable if the penalty can be completely avoided, which is the key motivation for this work. With this motivation, here we employ a Petrov-Galerkin (PG) formulation that uses IFE trial spaces but keeps the standard conforming FE test spaces. Then, there will be no penalty introduced from integration by parts, which nicely addresses the issue of (1.4). In order for the resulted matrix being square, the trial and test spaces should have the same number of DoFs. Thus, we shall design the IFE spaces to be isomorphic to the standard FE spaces through the usual DoFs. The isomorphism is shown by the mapping between the middle and bottom sequences in the Diagram (1.5), where the definition of the spaces and operators is given in Section 3.3. The original idea of PG formulation can be found in the fundamental work [6] of Babus\u030cka et al. and is then used in [28] for Multiscale FEM and [46] for IFE methods on H1 interface problems. This is a generalization of the previous work in [39] for H(curl) interface problems from 2D to 3D. However, the generalization is non-trivial due to the more complicated 3D geometry and the well-known essential difference between 2D and 3D H(curl) spaces.\nThere are multiple novelties in this work. We construct both the 3D H(curl) and H(div) IFE spaces according to their corresponding jump conditions which have not appeared in any literature. With the H1 IFE space in the literature, we establish the complete de Rham complex as shown by the middle sequence in Diagram (1.5) that is identical to the FE counterparts, including the exactness and commutative properties. It is well known that solving the resulting linear system from the H(curl) system is challenging, and the exact sequence is critical for developing fast solvers as it can accurately describe the kernel space of curl. Based on the de Rham complex and multigrid methods, we develop an IFE version of HX preconditioner [45]. In addition, the non-SPD matrix and the potentially small-cutting elements add another layer of difficulty for many unfitted mesh methods. We design a special smoother by computing the exact inverse of the nonSPD submatrix near the interface. The idea is closely related to domain decomposition methods [67]. We demonstrate by numerical experiments that the resulting fast solver works remarkably well for general minimum residual methods (GMRES) and even Conjugate-Gradient (CG) methods which typically do not converge for non-SPD systems. It is worthwhile to mention that CG-like methods have been developed for more general semi-symmetric matrices [55]. We also refer readers to multigrid methods for interface problems in [66, 49].\nThe article consists of 5 additional sections. In the next section, we describe the geometry and set up some notations. In Section 3, we establish the IFE spaces and their de Rham complex. In Section 4, we describe the PG-IFE formulation, the fast solver, and a numerical test for the inf-sup condition. In Section 5, we show the optimal approximation capabilities. In Section 6, we present some numerical experiments.\n2. Preliminary. In this section, we first describe an unfitted background mesh and introduce some spaces and notation which will be frequently used in this work.\n2.1. Meshes. Note that electromagnetic wave generally propagates over the whole space, and a widely used approach is to cover the interesting media by a box as a modeling and computational domain. So in this work, we shall assume our domain is cubic, and generate a background Cartesian mesh in which each cubic element is then partitioned into several tetrahedra. For example, we show two types of triangulation in the left two plots of Figure 2.1 where the triangulation in Type I does not introduce extra nodes but Type II introduces an extra node on each face and one inside the element. (We only show 4 tetrahedra in the second plot of Figure 2.1 for better illustration). All these tetrahedra form an interface-unfitted shape regular mesh\ndenoted by Th which will be used for discretization. Let Nh, Eh, and Fh be the collection of nodes, edges, and\nfaces of Th, respectively. For each element K, we let NK , EK , and FK be the collection of nodes, edges, and faces of K with |NK | = 4, |EK | = 6, and |FK | = 4.\nGiven the signed-distance level-set function of the interface denoted by \u03d5\u0393, we can compute its linear interpolation \u03d5\u0393h on the mesh Th; namely, \u03d5\u0393h interpolates \u03d5\u0393 at the mesh nodes and is piecewise linear on each element. Then, the numerical interface is defined as\n(2.1) \u0393h = {x : \u03d5\u0393h(x) = 0}.\nWe note that, as \u03d5\u0393h is piecewise linear, \u0393h is also piecewise linear and forms a polyhedron as a linear approximation to the exact interface. Linear interpolation of signed-distance functions has been widely used for discretizing interface numerically [63, 59]. For a smooth interface, the geometric error is in the order of O(h2), see Lemma 2.1 below, which is sufficient for a linear method [52]. Then, we let \u0393h cut \u2126 into \u2126 \u00b1 h . An element K is called an interface element if\n(2.2) min x\u2208NK \u03d5\u0393h(x) max x\u2208NK \u03d5\u0393h(x) < 0.\nAs \u03d5\u0393h interpolates \u03d5 \u0393 at the mesh nodes, (2.2) also implies that K intersects the exact interface. Let T ih be the collection of interface elements. For IFE methods, there are two advantages to using \u03d5\u0393h. First, as \u0393 K h is a plane, it is not hard to see that there are only two possible cases for \u0393Kh cutting a tetrahedron: three or four intersection points, see Figure B.1. Second, it is possible that the four intersection points of the original interface surface are not coplanar; but the cutting points of \u0393Kh are always coplanar, as shown in Figure 2.3. Of course, the cutting points of \u0393 may not be those of \u0393h, see Figure 2.2 for a 2D illustration where \u0393 K h does not pass through the cutting points of \u0393. With these two properties, the IFE shape functions always exist, see the discussion in Section 3. In addition, given a K \u2208 T ih , define the interface patch \u0393Kh = \u0393h \u2229K. Of course, there is a mismatching region sandwiched by \u0393h and \u0393, see the subregion enclosed by the red curve and blue polyline in Figure 2.2 for a 2D illustration. We define it as Kint := (K\n+ \u2229K\u2212h ) \u222a (K\u2212 \u2229K + h ) and \u2126int := \u222aK\u2208T ihKint.\nWe present the following geometric error estimate of which the proof is in Appendix 2.1.\nLemma 2.1. Suppose \u0393 is smooth enough such that \u03d5\u0393 is also smooth near the interface, and let the mesh size be sufficiently small. Then, for each interface element K and each x \u2208 \u0393 \u2229K, there holds\n\u2016x\u2212 x\u22a5\u2016 \u2264 c\u0393,1h2K ,(2.3a) \u2016n\u2212 n\u0304K\u2016 \u2264 c\u0393,2hK ,(2.3b)\nwhere x\u22a5 is the projection of x onto \u0393Kh , and n\u0304K is the normal vector to \u0393 K h with the same orientation as the normal vector to interface, i.e., n. Here, the constants c1\u0393 and c 2 \u0393 only depend on the interface curvature.\n2.2. Spaces. Given a subdomain D \u2286 \u2126, for a non-negative number s, we let Hs(D) be the standard Sobolev space. In addition, we introduce the following vector function spaces:\nHs(curl;D) = {u \u2208 Hs(D) : curl u \u2208 Hs(D)},(2.4a) Hs(div;D) = {u \u2208 Hs(D) : div u \u2208 Hs(D)}.(2.4b)\nGiven a subdomain D \u2286 \u2126, if D \u2229 \u0393 6= \u2205, we let D\u00b1 = \u2126\u00b1 \u2229D, and further denote Hs(\u222aD\u00b1), Hs(curl;\u222aD\u00b1) and Hs(div;\u222aD\u00b1) consisting of functions that belong to the corresponding Sobolev spaces on each D\u00b1. Given a face F in the mesh, we let rotF be the 2D rotationary operator on F , and define the space\n(2.5) Hs(rot;F ) = {u \u2208 Hs(F ) : rotF u \u2208 Hs(F )}.\nAs the IFE version of the de Rham complex is to be established, we need to additionally revisit the H1\nand H(div) interface problems and understand their connection. The H1-interface problem reads as\n(2.6) \u2212\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03b2\u2207u) = f in \u2126\u2212 \u222a \u2126+,\nwith f \u2208 L2(\u2126), subject to u = 0 on \u2202\u2126 and the jump conditions:\n[u]\u0393 := u + \u2212 u\u2212 = 0,(2.7a) [\u03b2\u2207u \u00b7 n]\u0393 := \u03b2+\u2207u+ \u00b7 n\u2212 \u03b2\u2212\u2207u\u2212 \u00b7 n = 0,(2.7b)\nwhere the parameter \u03b2 is the same as the one in (1.1c) that has the similar physical meaning related to conductivity. The H(div)-interface problem is given by\n(2.8) \u2212\u2207 div(u) + \u03b1u = f ,\nwith f \u2208 H(curl; \u2126), subject to u \u00b7 n = 0 on \u2202\u2126 and the jump conditions\n[u \u00b7 n]\u0393 := u+ \u00b7 n\u2212 u\u2212 \u00b7 n = 0,(2.9a) [\u03b1u\u00d7 n]\u0393 := \u03b1+u+ \u00d7 n\u2212 \u03b1\u2212u\u2212 \u00d7 n = 0,(2.9b) [div(u)]\u0393 : = div(u +)\u2212 div(u\u2212) = 0.(2.9c)\nThis system comes from the first-order least-squares formulation of the elliptic interface problem [68] or preconditioning for the mixed finite element using a gradient formulation [5]. The related finite element approximation for interface problems can be found in [42].\nNow, we encode the jump conditions for the H1 case (2.7), the H(curl) case (1.1), and the H(div) case (2.9) into the definition of the following special Sobolev spaces:\nH2(\u03b2;D) := {u \u2208 H2(\u222aD\u00b1) \u2229H1(D) : \u03b2\u2207u \u2208 H(div;D)},(2.10a) H1(\u03b1, \u03b2, curl;D) := {u \u2208 H1(curl;\u222aD\u00b1) \u2229H(curl;D) : \u03b2u \u2208 H(div;D), \u03b1 curl u \u2208 H(curl;D)},(2.10b)\nH1(\u03b1,div;D) := {u \u2208 H1(div;\u222aD\u00b1) \u2229H(div;D) : \u03b1u \u2208 H(curl;D), div u \u2208 H1(D)}.(2.10c)\nIn fact, the other interpretation of these interface conditions is to regard \u03b1 and \u03b2 as Hodge star operators mapping between fields in different Sobolev spaces, which is illustrated by the following Diagram (2.11). The construction of IFE spaces is just to mimic it locally on each interface element.\n(2.11)\nH2(\u03b2; \u2126) grad\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H1(curl, \u03b1, \u03b2; \u2126) curl\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H1(div, \u03b1; \u2126) div\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 H1(\u2126)yI y\u03b2 y\u03b1 yI\nL2(\u2126) div\u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 H(div; \u2126) curl\u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 H(curl; \u2126) grad\u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 H1(\u2126)\n3. Immersed Finite Element Spaces. In this section, we develop Ne\u0301de\u0301lec-type and Raviart-Thomastype IFE spaces that admit the edge and face DoFs, respectively. We shall use \u03b1h and \u03b2h for the discontinuous coefficients partitioned by \u0393h instead of \u0393. In the following discussion, let Pk(D) be the k-th degree polynomial space on a domain D. For readers\u2019 sake, we recall the lowest order local Ne\u0301de\u0301lec [57, 58] and Raviart-Thomas spaces [61]:\nND0(K) := {a\u00d7 x + b : a \u2208 R3, b \u2208 R3}, RT 0(K) := {c x + a : c \u2208 R, a \u2208 R3}.(3.1a)\n3.1. The local H1, H(curl) and H(div) IFE Spaces. Let us briefly recall the local IFE spaces [18, 51]. Consider two piecewise constant vector spaces:\nAh(K) = {c : c\u00b1 = c|K\u00b1h \u2208 [ P0(K\u00b1h ) ]3 , c \u2208 H(div;K), \u03b1hc \u2208 H(curl;K)},(3.2a)\nBh(K) = {c : c\u00b1 = c|K\u00b1h \u2208 [ P0(K\u00b1h ) ]3 , c \u2208 H(curl;K), \u03b2hc \u2208 H(div;K)}.(3.2b)\nWe can derive the specific format for functions in (3.2). Given each interface element with the approximate plane \u0393Kh , let n\u0304K , t\u0304K,1 and t\u0304K,2 be its unit normal vector and two orthogonal unit tangential vectors. Further denote the transformation matrix by TK = [n\u0304K , t\u0304K,1, t\u0304K,2]. Define the transformation matrices:\n(3.3) AK = TK  1 0 00 \u03b1\u0303 0 0 0 \u03b1\u0303 T>K and BK = TK  \u03b2\u0303 0 00 1 0 0 0 1 T>K , where \u03b1\u0303 = \u03b1+/\u03b1\u2212 and \u03b2\u0303 = \u03b2+/\u03b2\u2212. Then, the spaces Ah(K) and Bh(K) can be rewritten as\n(3.4) Ah(K) = {c : c\u00b1 \u2208 [ P0(K\u00b1h ) ]3 , c\u2212 = AKc +}, Bh(K) = {c : c\u00b1 \u2208 [ P0(K\u00b1h ) ]3 , c\u2212 = BKc +}.\nWith these two fundamental spaces, we are able to construct the H1, H(curl), and H(div) IFE spaces,\ndenoted by Snh (K), S e h(K), and S f h(K), which are reported in Table 1 including their corresponding jump condition and general function format. One can easily check that the IFE spaces above belong to the corresponding Sobolev spaces. Moreover, the formats are identical to the standard Lagrange, Ne\u0301de\u0301lec, and Raviart-Thomas elements in which the only difference is the vectors a and b replacing the simple constant vectors in [P0(K)]3. Then, it is easy to see the following sequence\n(3.5) R \u21aa\u2192\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Snh (K) \u2207\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Seh(K) curl\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Sfh(K) div\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 P0(K) \u2212\u2192 0.\n3.2. Degrees of Freedom. For the H1 case, it has been proved in [51] that the functions in Snh (K) admit nodal DoFs for the two types of tetrahedra shown in the right two plots of Figure 2.1. Namely, there exist \u03c6ni , i = 1, 2, 3, 4, such that \u03c6 n i (zj) = \u03b4ij , where zj , j = 1, 2, 3, 4, are the nodes of K. Then, the global H 1 IFE space is defined as\nSnh = {vh \u2208 L2(\u2126) : vh|K \u2208 Snh (K), if K \u2208 T ih , and vh|K \u2208 P1(K), if K \u2208 T nh vh is continuous at x \u2208 Nh}. (3.6)\nAlthough the local H(curl) and H(div) IFE spaces are constructed in [18], their edge and face DoFs have not been addressed yet, which is our focus in this subsection. Thanks to the special geometry of the considered tetrahedra, the discussion will be relatively easier.\nHere, the most difficult one is the edge space Seh(K). But, we will see that the edge shape functions can be constructed from the nodal and face shape functions in a manner exactly the same as the standard FE spaces. We shall see that the local exact sequence for the IFE spaces in (3.5) can help in simplifying the analysis.\nLet us first consider the unisolvence of Sfh(K) and begin by deriving a formula for computing H(div) IFE shape functions. Given an interface element K with 4 faces Fi, i = 1, 2, ..., 4, we let vi = \u222b Fi\nvh \u00b7 n ds, with nFi being the normal vector to Fi, for any function vh = c(x\u2212 xK) + ah \u2208 S f h(K) based on Table 1, and let v0 = v1 + v2 + v3 + v4. Determining c is straightforward:\n(3.7) c = div(vh)\n3 =\n1\n3|K| \u222b K div(vh) dx = 1 3|K| 4\u2211 i=1 \u222b Fi vh \u00b7 nFi ds = v0 3|K| .\nThen, by (3.4) ah should satisfy the equations: \u2200i = 1, ..., 4,\n(3.8) |F+i |a + h \u00b7 nFi + |F \u2212 i |a \u2212 h \u00b7 nFi = |F + i |n > Fia + h + |F \u2212 i |n > FiAKa + h = vi \u2212 v0 3|K| \u222b Fi (x\u2212 xK) \u00b7 nFi ds.\nConsidering (3.8) on three arbitrary faces F1, F2 and F3, we obtain a linear system for the vector a + h :\n(3.9) MKa + h = v\u0304, with MK = \u03a6 +NK + \u03a6 \u2212NKAK ,\nwhere \u03a6\u00b1 = diag(|F\u00b11 |, |F \u00b1 2 |, |F \u00b1 3 |), NK = [nF1 ,nF2 ,nF3 ]> and v\u0304 is given by the right-hand side of (3.8). Thus, the solvability of a+h is equivalent to the invertibility of MK .\nLemma 3.1. Given a trirectangular tetrahedral or regular tetrahedral interface element K, the space Sfh(K) has the DoFs \u222b Fi\nvh \u00b7 nFi ds, i = 1, 2, ..., 4. Proof. It remains to show the invertibility of MK . We treat the two types of tetrahedra separatly. If K is a trirectangular tetrahedron, we chose Fi, i = 1, 2, 3, as the three orthogonal faces. Then, NK is\nan orthonormal matrix, and we can rewrite\n(3.10) MKN > K = \u03a6 + + \u03a6\u2212NKAKN > K = \u03a6 + \u03a6 \u2212NK(AK \u2212 I)N>K = \u03a6 ( I + \u03a6\u22121\u03a6\u2212NK(AK \u2212 I)N>K ) ,\nwhere \u03a6 = diag(|F1|, |F2|, |F3|) = \u03a6\u2212 + \u03a6+. Without loss of generality, we can assume \u03b1\u0303 = \u03b1+/\u03b1\u2212 \u2264 1; otherwise we simply consider the matrix MKA \u22121 K N > K = \u03a6 +NKAKN > K + \u03a6\n\u2212. Let \u03bbmax(\u00b7) be the largest magnitude of eigenvalues of a matrix. Note that \u03bbmax(\u03a6\n\u22121\u03a6\u2212) \u2264 1 and \u03bbmax(NK(AK \u2212 I)N>K) = \u03bbmax(AK \u2212 I) = 1\u2212 \u03b1\u0303. In addition, since \u03a6\u22121\u03a6\u2212 is a diagonal matrix and NK(AK \u2212 I)N>K is symmetric, it is well-known that \u03a6\u22121\u03a6\u2212NK(AK \u2212 I)N>K has real eigenvalues, and\n(3.11) \u03bbmax(\u03a6 \u22121\u03a6\u2212NK(AK \u2212 I)N>K) \u2264 \u03bbmax(\u03a6\u22121\u03a6\u2212)\u03bbmax(NK(AK \u2212 I)N>K) \u2264 1\u2212 \u03b1\u0303.\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of I + \u03a6\u22121\u03a6\u2212NK(AK \u2212 I)N>K must be bounded below by 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b1\u0303) = \u03b1\u0303, and thus, from (3.10), the matrix MK is non-singular.\nIf K is a regular tetrahedron, such a simple proof is not available. Instead, we have to employ a computeraided argument to verify that MK is non-singular. As it is technical, we put it in Appendix C.\nLemma 3.1 guarantees the existence of face shape functions \u03c6fi , i = 1, 2, 3, , 4 satisfying\n(3.12)\n\u222b Fj \u03c6fi \u00b7 n ds = \u03b4ij , j = 1, 2, 3, 4,\nregardless of interface location. Then the global H(div) IFE space can be constructed as\nSfh = {vh \u2208 L 2(\u2126) :vh|K \u2208 Sfh(K), if K \u2208 T i h , and vh|K \u2208 RT 0(K), if K \u2208 T nh ,\u222b\nF\n[vh \u00b7 n] ds = 0, \u2200F \u2208 Fh}. (3.13)\nWith the nodal and face shape functions, we are ready to analyze the DoFs of Seh(K).\nLemma 3.2. Given a trirectangular tetrahedral or regular tetrahedral interface element K, the space Seh(K) has the DoFs \u222b ei vh \u00b7 ti ds, i = 1, 2, ..., 6.\nProof. Given an interface element K with 6 edges ei, i = 1, ..., 6, we let vi = \u222b ei\nvh \u00b7 ti ds for a function vh \u2208 Seh(K) where ti have some assigned orientation. We need to show that vh uniquely exists for arbitrary vi. As the dimensions match, we only need to prove the existence which is done by explicit construction. For each face Fj of K, we let (3.14) wj = \u2211\nei\u2282\u2202Fj\ncj,eivi, j = 1, ..., 4, and \u03c6 f = 4\u2211 j=1 wj\u03c6 f j ,\nwhere cj,ei = 1 or \u22121 is a sign to correct the orientation such that the edges associated with each face has the counter-clockwise orientation. So, trivially \u22114 j=1 wj = 0 and thus \u03c6\nf is div-free, i.e., \u03c6f \u2208 curl Seh(K) by the local exact sequence in (3.5). We then proceed to construct the component in Snh (K). Let the four nodes of K be zl, l = 1, ..., 4. Picking any node, say z4, without loss of generality, we let the three neighbor edges be ei pointing to zi, i = 1, 2, 3. Define the orientation coefficients di = 1 if ti points from z4 to another ending point of ei, otherwise di = \u22121. We then construct (3.15) \u03c6n = \u2211\ni=1,2,3\ndi ( vi \u2212 \u222b ei (\u03c6f \u00d7 (x\u2212 xK)) \u00b7 ti/2 ds ) \u03c6ni .\nNow, the edge function has the edge integral values vi, i = 1, ..., 6, can be constructed as\n(3.16) \u03c6e = \u03c6f \u00d7 (x\u2212 xK)/2 +\u2207\u03c6n.\nIt is easy to see that \u03c6e matches the DoFs on ei, i = 1, 2, 3. The verification of the rest edges can be shown by the DoFs of \u03c6f and \u03c6n with the formula \u222b F curl\u03c6e \u00b7 n ds = \u222b F rotF \u03c6 e ds = \u222b \u2202F \u03c6e \u00b7 t ds for each face F .\nThanks to the same DoFs, the whole construction procedure exactly mimics the standard FE spaces. Lemma 3.2 guarantees the existence of Ne\u0301de\u0301lec IFE shape functions \u03c6ei , i = 1, 2, ..., 6, satisfying\n(3.17)\n\u222b ej \u03c6ei \u00b7 t ds = \u03b4ij , j = 1, 2, ..., 6.\nThen, the global H(curl) IFE space can be constructed as\nSeh = {vh \u2208 L2(\u2126) : vh|K \u2208 Seh(K), if K \u2208 T ih , and vh|K \u2208 ND0(K), if K \u2208 T nh ,\u222b e (vh|K1 \u2212 vh|K2) \u00b7 t ds = 0, \u2200e \u2208 Eh, \u2200K1,K2 sharing e}. (3.18)\nRemark 3.1. The integral conditions in both (3.18) and (3.13) simply imply the tangential and normal continuity on non-interface edges and faces, which is the same as the standard FE spaces. However, the difference is on interface edges and faces where the integral conditions can not imply the exact continuity. Take the H(curl) case as example: \u222b e (vh|K1 \u2212vh|K2) \u00b7 t ds can not imply (vh|K1 \u2212vh|K2) \u00b7 t = 0 since vh \u00b7 t is piecewise constant on e\u00b1h . So the DoFs should be only understood as continuity in certain average sense. We illustrate this kind of discontinuity in Figure 3.1 for an edge IFE function vh where we show the tangential traces vh|Ki \u00d7n (right) from the two neighbor elements, Ki, i = 1, 2, (left) on their sharing the face F (right). Furthermore, for the H(curl) case, the integral conditions \u222b e (vh|K1 \u2212 vh|K2) \u00b7 t ds = 0, \u2200e \u2282 \u2202F can not even\nyield \u222b F [vh \u00d7 n] ds = 0, which is another difference from the standard FE space.\nFinally, the node, edge and face DoFs make the following interpolation operators well-defined:\nInh : H 2(\u03b2; \u2126)\u2192 Snh , satisfying Inhu(x) = u(x), \u2200x \u2208 Nh,(3.19a)\nIeh : H 1(\u03b1, \u03b2, curl; \u2126)\u2192 Seh, satisfying \u222b e Iehu \u00b7 t ds = \u222b e u \u00b7 t ds, \u2200e \u2208 Eh,(3.19b)\nIfh : H 1(\u03b1,div; \u2126)\u2192 Sfh, satisfying \u222b F Ifhu \u00b7 n ds = \u222b F u \u00b7 n ds, \u2200F \u2208 Fh.(3.19c)\n3.3. The de Rham Complex. Now, we recover the well-known and important de Rham complex in Diagram (1.5) for all the IFE spaces introduced above. Here, Qh denotes the piecewise constant space on the mesh Th, and \u03a00 denotes the L2 projection to Qh.\nTheorem 3.3. The sequence in the middle of (1.5) is a complex.\nProof. First of all, it is clear that R \u2282 Snh . Besides, with the local result in (3.5), we know that the functions mapped by the operators \u2207, curl and div must satisfy the corresponding jump conditions on each element. Thus, we only need to verify the corresponding integral conditions on edges and faces in (3.18) and (3.13), respectively. For each edge e \u2208 Eh with the nodes z1 and z2, we let K1 and K2 be any two elements sharing e. Then, given any vh \u2208 Snh , the continuity on nodes implies\n(3.20)\n\u222b e \u2207vh|K1 \u00b7 t ds = vh|K1(z2)\u2212 vh|K1(z1) = vh|K2(z2)\u2212 vh|K2(z1) = \u222b e \u2207vh|K2 \u00b7 t ds,\nwhere t is assumed from z1 to z2. So, we conclude \u2207vh \u2208 Seh. Next, for each face F \u2208 Fh, we let K1 and K2 be the two neighbor elements. Given any vh \u2208 Seh, we have\n(3.21) \u222b F curl vh|K1 \u00b7 nF ds = \u222b F rotF vh|K1 ds = \u222b \u2202F vh|K1 \u00b7 t ds = \u222b \u2202F vh|K2 \u00b7 t ds = \u222b F curl vh|K2 \u00b7 nF ds.\nTherefore, we have curl vh \u2208 Sfh. Finally, it is trivial that div(vh) \u2208 Qh for any vh \u2208 S f h.\nTheorem 3.4. The diagram formed by the sequences in the middle and top of (1.5) is commutative.\nProof. First of all, given every u \u2208 H2(\u03b2; \u2126), there holds for each e \u2208 Eh with the nodes z1 and z2 that\u222b e Ieh(\u2207u) \u00b7 t ds = \u222b e \u2207u \u00b7 t ds = u(z2)\u2212 u(z1) = Inhu(z2)\u2212 Inhu(z1) = \u222b e \u2207Inhu \u00b7 t ds(3.22)\nwhich implies Ieh \u25e6 \u2207 = \u2207 \u25e6 Inh . Next, given u \u2208 H1(\u03b1, \u03b2, curl; \u2126), there holds\n(3.23)\n\u222b F Ifh curl u \u00b7 n ds = \u222b F curl u \u00b7 n ds = \u222b \u2202F u \u00b7 t ds = \u222b \u2202F Iehu \u00b7 t ds = \u222b F curl Iehu \u00b7 n ds\nwhich shows Ifh \u25e6 curl = curl \u25e6Ieh. Finally, for every u \u2208 H1(\u03b1,div; \u2126), integration by parts yields\n(3.24)\n\u222b K \u03a00K div u dx = \u222b K div u dx = \u222b \u2202K u \u00b7 n ds = \u222b \u2202K Ifnu \u00b7 n ds = \u222b K div Ifhu ds\nwhich yields \u03a00 \u25e6 div = div \u25e6Ifh . Then, the commutativity has been proved. To show the exactness, let us first describe the isomorphism between the IFE spaces and standard FE spaces. Let S\u0303nh , S\u0303 e h and S\u0303 f h be the standard Lagrange, Ne\u0301de\u0301lec and Raviart-Thomas spaces defined on the same mesh Th. Note that the interpolations Inh , Ieh and I f h are all well-defined on these standard spaces, which lead to certain isomorphism; namely their inversions from the IFE spaces to FE spaces are also well-defined. We shall keep the same notation Inh , I e h and I f h as the isomorphism, and illustrate this structure by the diagram formed from the middle and bottom sequences in (1.5), where I is the identity operator.\nLemma 3.5. The diagram formed by the middle and bottom sequences in (1.5) is commutative.\nProof. The argument is the same as Theorem 3.4 by verifying the DoFs.\nLemma 3.6. The operators Inh , I e h and I f h and their inversions preserve the kernels of \u2207, curl and div:\nker(\u2207) \u2229 S\u0303nh Inh\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\n(Inh ) \u22121\nker(\u2207) \u2229 Snh ,(3.25a)\nker(curl) \u2229 S\u0303eh Ieh\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\n(Ieh) \u22121\nker(curl) \u2229 Seh,(3.25b)\nker(div) \u2229 S\u0303fh Ifh\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\n(Ifh) \u22121\nker(div) \u2229 Sfh.(3.25c)\nProof. (3.25a) is trivial since ker(\u2207)\u2229 S\u0303nh = ker(\u2207)\u2229Snh = P0(K) and Inh preserves constants. For (3.25b), thanks to the local exact sequence, we know vh \u2208 ker(curl)\u2229S\u0303eh if and only if \u222b F curl vh \u00b7n ds = \u222b \u2202F\nvh \u00b7t ds = 0, for each face F \u2208 FK , which is equivalent to \u222b \u2202F Iehvh \u00b7 t ds = \u222b F\ncurl Iehvh \u00b7n ds = 0. Then, Lemma 3.1 yields the desired result. The argument for (3.25c) and its inverse direction is similar.\nTheorem 3.7. The sequence on the middle of (1.5) is exact.\nProof. The result directly follows from Lemma 3.6 and the exactness for the standard FE spaces.\n4. The Petrov-Galerkin IFE Method for The H(curl) Interface Problem. In this section, we apply the IFE spaces, particularly the H(curl) IFE space, to the H(curl) interface problem.\n4.1. Schemes. For simplicity of presentation, we here only consider the perfect electric conductor (PEC) or correspondingly the perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) boundary condition, i.e., u\u00d7n = 0 on \u2202\u2126. For the quasi-static equation (1.2), the proposed PG-IFE scheme is to find uh \u2208 Seh,0, i.e., the subspace of Seh with the zero trace, such that\n(4.1) ah(uh,vh) = (f ,v)\u2126, \u2200vh \u2208 S\u0303eh,0 with ah(uh,vh) := (\u03b1h curl uh, curl vh)\u2126 + (\u03b2huh,vh)\u2126,\nwhere (\u00b7, \u00b7)\u2126 denotes the standard L2 inner product. Note that (4.1) follows from the integration by parts of (1.3) which always holds as long as the test function space is H(curl)-conforming. Namely, even without any penalties, the scheme (4.1) is still consistent. Thanks to the isomorphism between the IFE and FE spaces, the resulting linear system is square. So the PG formulation completely avoids the non-conformity issue aforementioned in the introduction.\n4.2. Fast Solvers: HX Preconditioner. The resulting linear system of (4.1) is denoted by\n(4.2) BPGu\u0304 = f\u0304\nwhere BPG is not symmetric positive definite (SPD). However, the majority portion of BPG is indeed SPD, and the \u201cproblematic\u201d portion is only around the interface. So, naturally, it may help if we employ the exact solver on the subsystem around the interface and use an iterative solver on the rest part of the system, which motivates the following fast solver. Define the collections of elements and edges around the interface:\nT lh = {K \u2208 Th : K \u2229K \u2032 6= \u2205, for some K \u2032 \u2208 T l\u22121h }, E l h = {e \u2208 Eh : e \u2208 EK for some K \u2208 T lh},(4.3)\nwhere T 0h = T ih is simply the set of interface elements. It is not hard to see that T lh and E lh can expand to the whole domain from the interface when we increase l. But with relatively small l, the set E lh is sufficient to cover the \u201cproblematic\u201d DoFs. Assuming the DoFs associated with E lh are indexed at the end, we can write\n(4.4) BPG =\n[ B\n(1,1) l B (2,1) l\nB (1,2) l B (2,2) l\n] ,\nwhere B (1,1) l is SPD but B (2,2) l is non-SPD and also B (1,2) l 6= (B (2,1) l ) >.\nWe write B\u2207 as the matrix associated with the IFE discretization of the bilinear form\n(4.5) a\u2207h,1(uh,vh) := (\u03b1h\u2207uh,\u2207vh)\u2126 + (\u03b2huh,vh)\u2126, \u2200uh,vh \u2208 [Snh,0]3,\nand write B\u2207 as the matrix of the bilinear form\n(4.6) a\u2207h,2(uh, vh) := (\u03b1h\u2207uh,\u2207vh)\u2126, \u2200uh, vh \u2208 Snh,0.\nBased on (4.4), we then construct a special smoother:\n(4.7) BPGl =\n[ diag(B\n(1,1) l ) 0\n0 B (2,2) l\n] ,\nIn the following discussion, BPGl and l shall be frequently referred to as a \u201cblock diagonal smoother\u201d and an \u201cexpanding width\u201d. Then, the IFE version of the HX preconditioner [45] is\n(4.8) Bcurl = [BPGl ] \u22121 + Pcurl(B \u2207)\u22121P>curl +G(B \u2207)\u22121G>\nwhere G is the matrix associated with \u2207 : S\u0303nh \u2192 S\u0303eh, and Pcurl is the matrix associated with the operator \u03a0curlh : [S\u0303 n h ] \u2192 S\u0303eh such that \u03a0 curl h w|e \u00b7 t = (w1 + w2) \u00b7 t, \u2200e \u2208 Eh with w1 and w2 being the nodal values of w at the nodes of e. We emphasize that forming such a matrix highly relies on the isomorphism between IFE and FE spaces through the DoFs. The matrices B\u2207 and B\u2207 are SPDs and their inverses are approximated by a few algebraic multigrid (AMG) cycles. The [BPGl ] \u22121, particularly the block (B (2,2) l )\n\u22121, is computed by the direct solver (the backslash in MATLAB) as it is of small size, and we shall see that this direct solver only has a very subtle effect on the total computational time but is the key to handle the \u201cproblematic\u201d DoFs near the interface. We adopt the HX preconditioner implemented in iFEM [23].\n4.3. Numerical Test of the Inf-Sup Condition. Define the natural energy norm ||wh||2h,D = \u222b D \u03b1h curl wh \u00b7 curl wh dx + \u222b D \u03b2hwh \u00b7wh dx, \u2200wh \u2208 Seh or S\u0303eh.\nClearly, there holds the identity \u2016vh\u20162h,\u2126 = ah(vh,vh) and the norm equivalence \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016H(curl;\u2126) ' ||\u00b7||h,\u2126. With the optimal approximation capabilities of the H(curl) IFE spaces discussed later, one can immediately show the optimal convergence for the PG-IFE scheme as long as the following inf-sup condition holds:\n(4.9) \u03b7s := sup vh\u2208S\u0303eh,0\nah(uh,vh)\n\u2016vh\u2016h,\u2126\u2016uh\u2016h,\u2126 \u2265 Cs, \u2200uh \u2208 Seh,0.\nHowever, it is generally quite challenging to show such a inf-sup condition. The approach of Babus\u030cka in [6] assumes a certain structure of the elliptic coefficient. The proof of the 2D PG-IFE method [39] highly relies on the symmetry of the high-order curl-curl term, which does not hold anymore for the 3D case. In this work, instead of pursuing a rigorous theoretical analysis, we provide a numerical test for the inf-sup condition (4.9).\nDenote BFE and BIF as the matrices corresponding to the FE and IFE schemes on the same mesh, i.e., the matrices associated with the bilinear forms ah(wh,vh), wh,vh \u2208 S\u0303eh,0 and ah(wh,vh), wh,vh \u2208 Seh,0, respectively. Further let N be the total number of edge DoFs. Then, (4.9) is equivalent to\n(4.10) sup v\u0304\u2208RN v\u0304>BPGu\u0304\u221a u\u0304>BIF u\u0304 \u221a v\u0304>BFEv\u0304 \u2265 Cs, \u2200u\u0304 \u2208 RN .\nIn general, one may verify (4.10) by constructing a suitable test function v\u0304 = Pu\u0304, where P is a non-singular matrix, such that\n(4.11) u\u0304>P>BPGu\u0304\u221a\nu\u0304>BIF u\u0304 \u221a u\u0304>P>BFEPu\u0304 \u2265 Cs, \u2200u\u0304 \u2208 RN .\nIt is not hard to see that (4.11) implies (4.13) as it takes sup over v\u0304 \u2208 RN . We shall concentrate on (4.11).\nNote that one natural choice of the test function vh = (I e h) \u22121uh. Consequently, in (4.11) u\u0304 = v\u0304, i.e., P is an identity matrix, and thus an equivalent condition for (4.11) to hold is BPG + (BPG)> being SPD. Unfortunately, numerical results show that BPG + (BPG)> has negative eigenvalues. Our experience suggests that such a local construction approach may not be appropriate. Hence, we consider a global construction approach. Given each IFE function uh \u2208 Seh,0, we define its projection to the FE space denoted by \u03c0huh \u2208 S\u0303eh,0 through ah(\u00b7, \u00b7), namely\n(4.12) ah(uh,vh) = ah(\u03c0huh,vh), \u2200vh \u2208 S\u0303eh,0.\nNote that (4.12) is always well-defined since ah is SPD on the FE space. The corresponding vector solution of \u03c0huh is v\u0304 = (B FE)\u22121BPGu\u0304, i.e., P = (BFE)\u22121BPG. Notice that\n(4.13) u\u0304>P>BPGu\u0304 = u\u0304>(BPG)>(BFE)\u22121BPGu\u0304 = u\u0304>P>BFEPu\u0304.\nThus, (4.11) becomes the following minimization problem\n(4.14) \u03b7s = min u\u0304\u2208RN\n\u221a u\u0304>(BPG)>(BFE)\u22121BPGu\u0304\u221a\nu\u0304>BIF u\u0304 .\nSimilar to [7, 21], the solution to the minimization problem in (4.14) is the smallest generalized eigenvalue:\n(4.15) (BPG)>(BFE)\u22121BPGw\u0304 = \u03bbBIF w\u0304.\nHere, \u03bb must be non-negative as the matrices on the left is semi-SPD and the right one is SPD. Thus, we have \u03b7s = \u221a \u03bbmin which can be used as a numerical estimate of the inf-sup constant. We refer readers to Section 6 for the numerical results.\n5. Approximation Capabilities. In this section, we proceed to show the optimal approximation capabilities of the IFE spaces. Due to the interface conditions, it will be very different from the estimation of the interpolation for the standard FE spaces in [29, 56]. Before the technical details, let us describe some major challenges and the fundamental idea, which also illustrates the structure of this section. The first one concerns the mismatching portion sandwiched by \u0393h and \u0393 around the interface. To deal with this issue, we employ the \u03b4-strip argument [43, 52] that is widely used for interface problems, but special attention should be paid to the low regularity of functions in H1(\u03b1, \u03b2, curl; \u2126). This result together with some other fundamental estimates will be presented in Section 5.1. The second one is the non-smoothness of the IFE functions across the interface which makes classical techniques unapplicable here. For this issue, a special quasi-interpolation will be constructed to encode the jump information that is discussed in Section 5.2. In Section 5.3, the quasi-interpolation will be used as a bridge to estimate the face and edge interpolations.\n5.1. Some Fundamental Estimates. We first define the \u03b4-strip S\u03b4 = {x : dist(x,\u0393) \u2264 \u03b4}. Note that Lemma 5.3 immediately implies that\n(5.1) \u2126int \u2282 S\u03b4, with 0 < \u03b4 \u2264 c0h2.\nThe key is the following estimate that enables us to control the L2-norm on the \u03b4-strip by its width.\nLemma 5.1. It holds for any z \u2208 H10 (\u2126\u00b1) that\n(5.2) \u2016z\u2016L2(S\u03b4) \u2264 C \u221a \u03b4\u2016z\u2016H1(\u2126).\nNext, we recall the H1(curl; \u2126) and H1(div; \u2126)-extension operators, see Theorem 3.4 and Corollary 3.5 in [43] and Theorem 3.2 in [42]. To simplify the discussion, we shall adopt the general differential operator d = curl or div widely used in differential forms.\nTheorem 5.1. For d = curl or div, there exist two bounded linear operators\n(5.3) E\u00b1d : H 1( d; \u2126\u00b1)\u2192 H1( d; \u2126),\nsuch that for each u \u2208 H1( d; \u2126\u00b1): 1. E\u00b1du = u a.e. in \u2126 \u00b1,\n2. \u2016E\u00b1du\u2016H1( d;\u2126) \u2264 CE\u2016u\u2016H1( d;\u2126\u00b1) with the constant CE only depending on \u2126.\nWith this theorem, we define u\u00b1E, d = E \u00b1 du \u00b1 which are the keys in the analysis. Furthermore, for any subdomain D \u2282 \u2126, we shall employ the following notation for simplicity:\n(5.4) \u2016u\u2016E, d,s,D = \u2016u+E, d\u2016Hs( d,D) + \u2016u \u2212 E, d\u2016Hs( d,D),\nand \u2016u\u2016E,s,D simply denotes the Sobolev norm without the curl or div terms, i.e., only the L2 norm. Next, we introduce a patch \u03c9K of each interface element K:\n(5.5) \u03c9K = \u222a{K \u2032 : \u2202K \u2032 \u2229 \u2202K 6= \u2205}.\nThen, for each \u03c9K , define \u0393 \u03c9K := \u0393 \u2229 \u03c9K and \u0393\u03c9Kh := \u0393\u0302Kh \u2229 \u03c9K , where \u0393\u0302Kh is the entire plane containing \u0393Kh . Namely, \u0393\u03c9Kh is the extension of \u0393 K h to the patch, see Figure 5.1 for an illustration. Let l \u0393 K be the maximal height within \u03c9K supporting \u0393 \u03c9K h . Then, there exist \u03b31 > 0 and \u03b32 > 0 such that\n(5.6) |\u0393\u03c9Kh | \u2265 \u03b31h 2 K and l \u0393 K \u2265 \u03b32hK ;\nnamely, \u0393\u03c9Kh as a polygon is always shape regular. The key of employing the patch is the following trace-type inequalities that have constants independent of interface location.\nLemma 5.2. On each interface element K, for vh \u2208 P1(K), there holds\n(5.7) |vh(z)| . h\u22121K \u2016vh\u2016L2(\u0393\u03c9Kh ), \u2200z \u2208 \u0393 \u03c9K h , and \u2016vh\u2016L2(\u0393\u03c9Kh ) . h \u22121/2 K \u2016vh\u2016L2(\u03c9K).\nProof. The first one is [38, Lemma 4.2]. The second follows from [38, Lemma 4.1] and an inverse inequality.\nSimilar to Lemma 2.1, the following geometric estimates regards the closeness between \u0393\u03c9K and \u0393\u03c9Kh .\nLemma 5.3. Under the conditions of Lemma 2.1, for each interface element K and its patch \u03c9K , there holds for each x \u2208 \u0393\u03c9Kh that\n(5.8) \u2016x\u2212 x\u22a5\u2016 \u2264 c\u0303\u0393,1h2K and \u2016n\u2212 n\u0304\u2016 \u2264 c\u0303\u0393,2hK .\nProof. The argument is similar to (2.1) by recognizing that (A.1) is actually true on \u03c9K . We further need the following Sobolev-type inequalities relying on the closeness between \u0393\u03c9K and \u0393\u03c9Kh .\nLemma 5.4. Given each interface element K, there holds\n\u2016a\u2212u\u2212E, d \u00d7 n\u0304K \u2212 a +u+E, d \u00d7 n\u0304K\u2016L2(\u0393\u03c9Kh ) . h 1/2 K \u2016u\u2016E,1,\u03c9K ,(5.9a)\n\u2016b\u2212u\u2212E, d \u00b7 n\u0304K \u2212 b +u+E, d \u00b7 n\u0304K\u2016L2(\u0393\u03c9Kh ) . h 1/2 K \u2016u\u2016E,1,\u03c9K ,(5.9b)\nwhere d = curl for (a, b) = (1, \u03b2), u \u2208 H1(\u03b1, \u03b2, curl; \u2126) or d = div for (a, b) = (\u03b1, 1), u \u2208 H1(\u03b1,div; \u2126). Proof. See Appedix B.\nRemark 5.1. As curl H1(\u03b1, \u03b2,\u2126, curl) \u2282 H1(\u03b1,div; \u2126), curl u with u \u2208 H1(\u03b1, \u03b2, curl,\u2126) actually satisfies (5.9) with d = div. Furthermoer, with continuity of div u, it can be similarly shown that\n(5.10) \u2016div u\u2212E,div \u2212 div u + E,div\u2016L2(\u0393\u03c9Kh ) . h 1/2 K \u2016u\u2016E,div,1,\u03c9K .\n5.2. Special Quasi-Interpolation Operators. To develop quasi-interpolation for handling the discontinuity of IFE functions across the interface, by Table 1 and (3.4), let us rewrite the functions in Seh(K) in the following format\n(5.11) vh =\n{ v+h = a + h \u00d7 (x\u2212 xK) + b + h , in K + h ,\nv\u2212h = CcurlK (v + h ) := (AKa + h )\u00d7 (x\u2212 xK) + (BKb + h ), in K \u2212 h ;\nand similarly, the functions in Sfh(K) can be represented as\n(5.12) vh =\n{ v+h = c0(x\u2212 xK) + a + h , in K + h ,\nv\u2212h = CdivK (v + h ) := c0(x\u2212 xK) + (AKa + h ), in K \u2212 h .\nThe operators CcurlK and CdivK can be considered as discrete extensions mapping the polynomial component on the \u201c+\u201d side to the \u201c\u2212\u201d side through the jump conditions. Note that the \u201c\u2212\u201d piece of IFE functions can be completely determined by the \u201c+\u201d piece. In addition, we also need an interpolation: P d\u03c9K : H( d;\u03c9K)\u2192 S\u0303h(K) where S\u0303h(K) = ND0(K) if d = curl or S\u0303h(K) = RT 0(K) if d = div such that\n(5.13) Pcurl\u03c9K v := (\u03a0 0 \u03c9K curl v)\u00d7 (x\u2212 xK)/2 + \u03a0 0 \u03c9Kv and P div \u03c9Kv := (\u03a0 0 \u03c9K div v)(x\u2212 xK)/3 + \u03a0 0 \u03c9Kv,\nwhere \u03a00\u03c9K is simply the projection onto [P0(\u03c9K)] 3 or [P0(\u03c9K)]. Note that P d\u03c9K will be only applied to each Sobolev extension u\u00b1E, d which are smooth functions involving no discontinuity. In fact, such a quasiinterpolation also results in a commutative diagram in Figure 5.3.\nNow, with C dK and P d\u03c9K , we define the quasi-interpolation J d K : H( d;K)\u2192 Sh(K) where Sh(K) = Seh(K)\nif d = curl or Sh(K) = S f h(K) if d = div, such that\n(5.14) J dKu =\n{ J d,+K u = P d\u03c9Ku + E, d, in K + h ,\nJ d,\u2212K u = C dK(P d\u03c9Ku + E, d), in K \u2212 h .\nRemark 5.2. Let us use the diagram in Figure 5.2 to briefly explain the motivation. Suppose P d\u03c9K (u + E, d) has sufficient approximation to u+E, d. Then, its discrete extension C dK(P d\u03c9Ku + E, d) may be also expected to be a good approximation to u\u2212E, d. So the quasi-interpolation J d K behaves close to a Hermitian-type interpolation.\nRemark 5.2 motivates the estimation: the \u201c+\u201d piece follows directly from the estimate of P d\u03c9Ku + E, d and the \u201c\u2212\u201d piece is given by the closeness between C dK(P d\u03c9Ku + E, d) and P\u03c9Ku \u2212 E, d. It suggests the decomposition\n(5.15) u\u2212 \u2212 J d,\u2212K u = (u \u2212 \u2212 P d\u03c9Ku \u2212 E,d) + (P d \u03c9Ku \u2212 E,d \u2212 J d,\u2212 K u) := \u03beu + \u03b7u.\nNow, we make the idea above more rigorous. Let us first estimate \u03beu in the following lemma.\nLemma 5.5. For w \u2208 H1( d;\u03c9K), there holds\n(5.16) \u2016w \u2212 P d\u03c9Kw\u2016H( d;\u03c9K) . hK\u2016w\u2016H1( d;\u03c9K).\nProof. The estimate for L2 norm directly follows from the approximation result of \u03a00\u03c9K and \u2016x\u2212xK\u2016 . hK for x \u2208 \u03c9K . The estimate for d-semi norm additionally follows from the commutative diagram in Figure 5.3.\nAs for \u03b7u, here we present a detailed discussion for d = curl, and the argument for the div case is similar. In order to deal with jumps, we define a special norm for vh \u2208 ND0(\u03c9K):\n(5.17) |||vh|||2curl,\u03c9K := h 2 K |vh(xK) \u00b7 n\u0304|2 + \u2016vh \u00d7 n\u0304\u20162L2(\u0393\u03c9Kh ) + \u2016 curl vh \u00d7 n\u0304\u2016 2 L2(\u0393 \u03c9K h ) + \u2016 curl vh \u00b7 n\u0304\u20162L2(\u0393\u03c9Kh ).\nWe show it is equivalent to the standard L2 norm.\nLemma 5.6. The norm equivalence h 1/2 K |||\u00b7|||curl,\u03c9K ' \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016H(curl;\u03c9K) holds in ND0(\u03c9K). Proof. Since vh \u2208 ND0(\u03c9K) is a polynomial, then Lemma 5.7 implies\n|vh(xK) \u00b7 n\u0304| . h\u22123/2K \u2016vh\u2016L2(\u03c9K), \u2016vh \u00d7 n\u0304\u2016L2(\u0393\u03c9Kh ) . h \u22121/2 K \u2016vh\u2016L2(\u03c9K), \u2016 curl vh \u00d7 n\u0304\u2016L2(\u0393\u03c9Kh ) . h \u22121/2 K \u2016 curl vh\u2016L2(\u03c9K), \u2016 curl vh \u00b7 n\u0304\u2016L2(\u0393\u03c9Kh ) . h \u22121/2 K \u2016 curl vh\u2016L2(\u03c9K), (5.18)\nwhich readily show h 1/2 K |||vh|||curl,\u03c9K . \u2016vh\u2016H(curl;\u03c9K). As for the reverse direction, we consider the expression\n(5.19) vh = curl vh \u00d7 (x\u2212 xK)/2 + vh(xK).\nNote that both vh \u00b7 n\u0304 and vh \u00d7 n\u0304 (rotation of the tangential component) can be understood as polynomials defined on \u0393\u03c9Kh . Therefore, using Lemma 5.7, we obtain\n(5.20) \u2016vh(xK)\u2016 . \u2016vh(xK)\u00d7 n\u0304\u2016+ |vh(xK) \u00b7 n\u0304| . h\u22121K \u2016vh \u00d7 n\u0304\u2016L2(\u0393\u03c9Kh ) + |vh(xK) \u00b7 n\u0304|.\nSimilarly, we also have\n(5.21) \u2016 curl vh\u2016 . \u2016 curl vh \u00d7 n\u0304\u2016+ | curl vh \u00b7 n\u0304| ' h\u22121K \u2016 curl vh \u00d7 n\u0304\u2016L2(\u0393\u03c9Kh ) + h \u22121 K \u2016 curl vh \u00b7 n\u0304\u2016L2(\u0393\u03c9Kh ),\nwhich leads to \u2016 curl vh\u2016L2(\u03c9K) . h 1/2 K |||vh|||curl,\u03c9K . Next, by (5.19), we have\n\u2016vh\u2016L2(\u03c9K) . h 5/2 K \u2016 curl vh\u2016+ h 3/2 K \u2016vh(xK)\u2016,(5.22)\nand then we apply (5.20) and (5.21) to each term in (5.22), which yields the desired reuslt.\nWe shall see that the norm |||\u00b7|||curl,\u03c9K is suitable for estimating \u03b7u = P curl \u03c9K u \u2212 E,curl \u2212 CcurlK (Pcurl\u03c9K u + E,curl). Lemma 5.7. For u \u2208 H1(\u03b1, \u03b2, curl; \u2126), there holds\n(5.23) \u2016Pcurl\u03c9K u \u2212 E,curl \u2212 C curl K (Pcurl\u03c9K u + E,curl)\u2016H(curl;\u03c9K) . hK\u2016u\u2016E,curl,1,\u03c9K .\nProof. Note that \u03b7u \u2208 ND0(\u03c9K). Then, Lemma 5.6 shows\n\u2016\u03b7u\u2016H(curl;\u03c9K) . h 1/2 K ( hK |\u03b7u(xK) \u00b7 n\u0304|+ \u2016\u03b7u \u00d7 n\u0304\u2016L2(\u0393\u03c9Kh )\n+\u2016 curl\u03b7u \u00d7 n\u0304\u2016L2(\u0393\u03c9Kh ) + \u2016 curl\u03b7u \u00b7 n\u0304\u2016L2(\u0393\u03c9Kh ) ) . (5.24)\nWe need to estimate each term in the right hand side of (5.24). As their estimates are similar, we only present the first term. By the normal jump condition for Seh in Table 1 and the first inequality in (5.6), we have\n|\u03b7u(xK) \u00b7 n\u0304| = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Pcurl\u03c9K u\u2212E,curl(xK) \u00b7 n\u0304\u2212 \u03b2+\u03b2\u2212Pcurl\u03c9K u+E,curl(xK) \u00b7 n\u0304 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 . h\u22121K \u2016\u03b2 \u2212Pcurl\u03c9K u \u2212 E,curl \u00b7 n\u0304\u2212 \u03b2 +Pcurl\u03c9K u + E,curl \u00b7 n\u0304\u2016L2(\u0393\u03c9Kh )\n. h\u22121K \u2211 s=\u00b1 \u2016\u03b2sPcurl\u03c9K u s E,curl \u00b7 n\u0304\u2212 \u03b2susE,curl \u00b7 n\u0304\u2016L2(\u0393\u03c9Kh )\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n(I)\n+ \u2016\u03b2+u+E,curl \u00b7 n\u0304\u2212 \u03b2 \u2212u\u2212E,curl \u00b7 n\u0304\u2016L2(\u0393\u03c9Kh )\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 (II) .\nFor (I), using the trace inequality with the second inequality in (5.6) and Lemma 5.5, we obtain\n(5.25) (I) . h\u22121/2K \u2016P curl \u03c9K u s E \u2212 usE\u2016L2(\u03c9K) + h 1/2 K |P curl \u03c9K u s E \u2212 usE |H1(\u03c9K) . h 1/2 K \u2016u s E\u2016H1(curl;\u03c9K)\nwhere we have used \u2016\u2207Pcurl\u03c9K u s E\u2016L2(\u03c9K) ' \u2016 curlPcurl\u03c9K u s E\u2016L2(\u03c9K) . \u2016usE\u2016H1(curl;\u03c9K). The estimate of (II) follows from (5.9b) in Lemma 5.4 with d = curl and b = \u03b2. The other terms in (5.24) follow from similar arguments with the corresponding estimates in Lemma 5.4 where for the curl terms we need Remark 5.1.\nThe result similar to Lemma 5.6 holds for d = div.\nLemma 5.8. For u \u2208 H1(\u03b1,div; \u2126), there holds\n(5.26) \u2016Pdiv\u03c9Ku \u2212 E,div \u2212 C div K (Pdiv\u03c9Ku + E,div)\u2016H(div;\u03c9K) . hK\u2016u\u2016E,div,1,\u03c9K .\nNow, we are ready to estimate J dK . Lemma 5.9. For u \u2208 H1(\u03b1, \u03b2, curl; \u2126) or u \u2208 H1(\u03b1,div; \u2126), there holds\n(5.27) \u2016u\u00b1E, d \u2212 J d,\u00b1 K u\u2016H(curl;\u03c9K) . hK\u2016u\u2016E, d,1,\u03c9K .\nProof. It can be seen from the Diagram 5.2 and definition (5.14) that the estimate of u+E, d\u2212J d,+ K u directly follows from Lemma 5.5. The estimate on \u201c\u2212\u201d piece follows from applying the triangular inequality to (5.15) with Lemmas 5.5 and 5.7.\n5.3. Face and Edge Interpolation. Lemma 5.9 only gives the local approximation capabilities. We then need to estimate the errors of the global spaces through the edge and face interpolations in (3.19). Note that the nodal interpolation of the H1 IFE space has been analyzed in [51].\nLet us first present the following estimates for the bounds of the face and edge shape functions.\nLemma 5.10. Under the conditions of Lemma 3.1, there holds that for i = 1, 2, ..., 4\n(5.28) \u2016\u03c6fi \u2016L\u221e(K) . h \u22122 K , and \u2016 div\u03c6 f i \u2016L\u221e(K) . h \u22123 K .\nProof. The second estimate in (5.28) is trivial since div\u03c6fi is a constant and \u222b K div\u03c6fi dx = \u222b \u2202K\n\u03c6fi \u00b7n ds. For the first one, using the estimate in the proof of Lemma 3.1 for the eigenvalues of MK for trirectangular tetrahedron and regular tetrahedron, we obtain |det(MK)| \u2265 C(\u03b1)h6K , where C(\u03b1) denotes a constant only depending on \u03b1. Then, there holds \u2016M\u22121K \u2016\u221e \u2264 C(\u03b1\u0303)h \u22122 K , which, by (3.9), shows \u2016ah\u2016 . h \u22122 K . Applying it with the second one in (5.28) to the general formula vh = c(x\u2212 xK) + ah \u2208 Sfh(K) yields the desired result. Lemma 5.11. Under the conditions of Lemma 3.2, there holds that for i = 1, 2, ..., 6\n(5.29) \u2016\u03c6ei\u2016L\u221e(K) . h\u22121K , and \u2016 curl\u03c6 e i\u2016L\u221e(K) . h\u22122K .\nProof. Lemma 5.10 with (3.16) and (3.14) already yields the second inequality in (5.29). Next, note that \u03c6n is constructed from (3.15). By Lemma 5.10 and \u2016x\u2212xK\u2016 . hK , we know |\u03c6n(z)| . 1, \u2200z \u2208 NK . Using the boundedness for H1 IFE shape functions [51], we have \u2016\u2207\u03c6n\u2016\u221e . h\u22121K . Then, applying it to (3.16) implies the first estimate in (5.29).\nLet us briefly explain the idea of interpolation estimationg. The key is to employ J dK as the bridge. Let\nIh be I e h if d = curl or I f h if d = div. Then, the following triangular inequality always holds\n(5.30) \u2016u\u2212 Ihu\u2016L2(K) \u2264 \u2016u\u2212 J dKu\u2016L2(K) + \u2016J dKu\u2212 Ihu\u2016L2(K).\nFor the first term in the right-hand side of (5.30), Lemma 5.9 almost gives the desired result, but special attention must be paid to the different partition of u and JKu which are defined with \u0393 and \u0393 K h , respectively.\nLemma 5.12. For u \u2208 H1(\u03b1, \u03b2, curl; \u2126) or u \u2208 H1(\u03b1,div; \u2126), there holds\n(5.31) \u2211 K\u2208T ih \u2016u\u2212 J dKu\u2016L2(K) . h(\u2016u\u2016H1( d;\u2126\u2212) + \u2016u\u2016H1( d;\u2126+)).\nProof. On each interface element K, we have (5.32) \u2016u\u2212 J dKu\u2016L2(K) \u2264 \u2211 s=\u00b1 \u2016usE, d \u2212 J d,s K u\u2016L2(Ksh) + \u2016u + E, d \u2212 u \u2212 E, d\u2016L2(Kint),\nwhere the estimate of the first term is readily given by Lemma 5.9. Summing (5.32) over all the interface elements and applying (5.1), Lemma 5.1 as well as Theorem 5.1, we have the desired result.\nNext, we turn into the term \u2016J dKu\u2212 Ihu\u2016L2(K) in (5.30). We need the following estimate\nLemma 5.13. For u \u2208 H1(\u03b1, \u03b2, curl; \u2126) or u \u2208 H1(\u03b1,div; \u2126), given a \u03b4-strip with \u03b4 . h2, there holds (5.33) \u2211 K\u2208T ih \u2016J d,\u00b1K u\u2016L2(S\u03b4\u2229\u03c9K) . h\u2016u\u2016H1( d;\u2126+).\nProof. For the \u201c+\u201d component, with the estimates |S\u03b4 \u2229\u03c9K | . h4K and \u2016x\u2212xK\u2016L2(S\u03b4\u2229\u03c9K) . h3K , we have\n\u2016J d,+K u\u2016L2(S\u03b4\u2229\u03c9K) . h 3 K\u2016\u03a00\u03c9K du + E, d\u2016+ h 2 K\u2016\u03a00\u03c9Ku + E, d\u2016\n. h3/2K \u2016\u03a0 0 \u03c9K du + E, d\u2016L2(\u03c9K) + h 1/2 K \u2016\u03a0 0 \u03c9Ku + E, d\u2016L2(\u03c9K) . h3/2K \u2016du + E, d\u2016L2(\u03c9K) + h 1/2 K \u2016u + E, d\u2016L2(\u03c9K) (5.34)\nwhere we have used the boundedness property for the projection \u03a00\u03c9K in the last inequality. Then, the desired estimate follows from summing (5.34) over all the interface elements, using the finite overlapping of \u03c9K , and applying the \u03b4-strip argument from Lemma 5.1 with \u03b4 ' hK as well as Theorem 5.1. For the \u201c\u2212\u201d side, by (3.3), we have the boundedness \u2016AK\u2016 . 1 and \u2016BK\u2016 . 1. Therefore, there also holds that\n(5.35) \u2016J d,\u2212K u\u2016L2(S\u03b4\u2229\u03c9K) . h 3 K\u2016\u03a00\u03c9K du + E, d\u2016+ h 2 K\u2016\u03a00\u03c9Ku + E, d\u2016\nof which the estimete is the same as (5.34).\nNow, with the estimate in Lemma 5.13, we proceed to show the second term in (5.30) and split the discussion for the edge and face elements.\n5.3.1. Face Interpolation. Let us first consider the face interpolation, and in the following discussion we fix d = div. We need the following assumption to handle the mismatching portion on faces:\n(A2) For each interface element K \u2208 T ih and any of its face F , define F\u0303 = F \u2229 Kint. Assume that there exists a \u03b4-strip S\u03b41 with \u03b41 ' O(h2) such that for every K \u2208 T ih , there is a pyramid PF\u0303 \u2282 \u03c9K \u2229 S\u03b41 with F\u0303 as its base satisfying that the height lF\u0303 of PF\u0303 supporting F\u0303 is O(hK).\nWe refer readers to the 2D illustration of this assumption in the left plot of Figure 5.4.\nTheorem 5.14. For u \u2208 H1(\u03b1,div; \u2126), under the Assumption A2, there holds\n(5.36) \u2016u\u2212 Ifhu\u2016L2(\u2126) . h(\u2016u\u2016H1(div;\u2126\u2212) + \u2016u\u2016H1(div;\u2126+)).\nProof. We only consider interface elements. Given K \u2208 T ih , by (5.30) and Lemma 5.12, it remains to estimate \u2016J dKu \u2212 I f hu\u2016L2(K). We need an auxiliary function w such that w\u00b1 = J d,\u00b1 K u \u2212 u \u00b1 E, d in K \u00b1, i.e., it is partitioned with \u0393. Note that w is slightly different from J dKu \u2212 u as J dKu is defined with \u0393Kh , and thus this difference is only on Kint. To control the mismatch, by Assumption A3 and the trace inequality for polynomials [65], we have\n(5.37) \u2016J d,+K u\u2212 J d,\u2212 K u\u2016L2(F\u0303 ) . h \u22121/2 K (\u2016J d,+ K u\u2016L2(S\u03b41\u2229\u03c9K ) + \u2016J d,\u2212 K u\u2016L2(S\u03b41\u2229\u03c9K )).\nNote that each component of w\u00b1 can be naturally extended to the whole element and whole patch. Noting that w\u00b1 \u2208 H1/2(F ) for each face of F , then by the trace inequality and Lemma 5.9 we have\n(5.38) \u2016w\u00b1\u2016L2(F\u00b1) . \u2016w\u00b1\u2016L2(F ) . h \u22121/2 K \u2016w\u2016L2(K) + h 1/2 K |w|H1(K) . h 1/2 K \u2016u\u2016E,div,1,\u03c9K .\nNow, by the definition of the face interpolation, we obtain\n\u2016J dKu\u2212 I f hu\u2016L2(K) = \u2016I f h (J d Ku\u2212 u)\u2016L2(K)\n. ( 4\u2211 i=1 |Fi|1/2(\u2016w+ \u00b7 n\u2016L2(Fi) + \u2016w \u2212 \u00b7 n\u2016L2(Fi)) + |F\u0303i| 1/2\u2016J d,+K u\u2212 J d,\u2212 K u\u2016L2(F\u0303i) ) \u2016\u03c6fi \u2016L2(K) .hK\u2016u\u2016E,div,1,\u03c9K + (\u2016J d,+ K u\u2016L2(S\u03b41\u2229\u03c9K ) + \u2016J d,\u2212 K u\u2016L2(S\u03b41\u2229\u03c9K )), (5.39)\nwhere we have used (5.37), (5.38) and Lemma 5.10. Summing (5.39) over all the elements, using the finite overlapping property of \u03c9K , and applying Lemma 5.13 and Theorem 5.1 yields the desired result.\nIn addition, the estimate of div(u\u2212 Ifhu) is trivial due to the commutative property by Lemma 3.5. Theorem 5.15. For u \u2208 H1(\u03b1,div; \u2126), there holds\n(5.40) \u2016 div(u\u2212 Ifhu)\u2016L2(\u2126) . h(\u2016u\u2016H1(div;\u2126\u2212) + \u2016u\u2016H1(div;\u2126+)).\n5.3.2. Edge Interpolation. Next, we proceed to estimate the approximation capabilities of the global space Seh through the interpolation I e h. We need a similar assumption to A2.\n(A3) For each interface element K \u2208 T ih and any of its edge e, define e\u0303 = e \u2229Kint, i.e., the portion of the edge contained in the mismatching region Kint. Assume that there exists a \u03b4-strip S\u03b42 with \u03b42 ' O(h2) such that for every K \u2208 T ih , there is a tetrahedron Te\u0303 \u2282 \u03c9K \u2229 S\u03b42 with e\u0303 as one of its edges satisfying |Te\u0303| & |e\u0303|2hK .\nWe illustrate this assumption in Figure 5.4. In the following disucssion, we fix d = curl.\nTheorem 5.16. For u \u2208 H1(\u03b1, \u03b2, curl; \u2126), under Assumption A3, there holds\n(5.41) \u2016u\u2212 Iehu\u2016L2(\u2126) . h(\u2016u\u2016H1(curl;\u2126\u2212) + \u2016u\u2016H1(curl;\u2126+)).\nProof. We still only consider interface elements. Similar to the argument of Theorem 5.14, we only need to estimate \u2016J dKu\u2212Iehu\u2016L2(K). Define the same auxiliary function w partitioned with \u0393 and w\u00b1 = J d,\u00b1 K u\u2212u \u00b1 E, d in K\u00b1. Let us estimate J d,+K u\u2212 J d,\u2212 K u on the small subedge e\u0304. By Assumption A3 and the trace inequality for polynomials [65], we obtain\n(5.42) \u2016J d,+K u\u2212 J d,\u2212 K u\u2016L2(e\u0304) . h \u22121/2 K |e\u0303| \u22121/2(\u2016J d,+K u\u2016L2(S\u03b42\u2229\u03c9K ) + \u2016J d,\u2212 K u\u2016L2(S\u03b42\u2229\u03c9K )).\nIn addition, as u\u00b1E, d \u2208 H1(curl; \u2126), the first moment \u222b e u\u00b1E, d \u00b7 t ds is well defined on each edge e. Furthermore, we have u\u00b1E, d \u2208 H1/2(F )\u2229H(rot;F ) on each face F . Thus, by Lemma 4.4 in [33] and the trace inequality, we obtain for each face F of K and any one of its edge e that\n\u2016w\u00b1\u2016L1(e\u00b1) . \u2016w\u00b1\u2016L1(e) . \u2016w\u00b1\u2016L2(F ) + h 1/2 F \u2016w \u00b1\u2016H1/2(F ) + hF \u2016 rotF w\u00b1\u2016L2(F ) . h\u22121/2K \u2016w \u00b1\u2016L2(K) + h 1/2 K \u2016w\n\u00b1\u2016H1(K) + h\n1/2 K \u2016 curl w \u00b1\u2016L2(K) + h 3/2 K \u2016 curl w \u00b1\u2016H1(K) . h 1/2 K \u2016u\u2016E,curl,1,\u03c9K ,\n(5.43)\nwhere we have used Lemma 5.9 in the forth inequality with the following estimates\n\u2016w\u00b1\u2016H1(K) . \u2016u\u00b1E, d\u2016H1(K) + \u2016 curl J d,\u00b1 K u\u2016L2(K) . \u2016u\u2016E,curl,1,\u03c9K , \u2016 curl w\u00b1\u2016H1(K) . \u2016 curl u\u00b1E, d\u2016H1(K) . \u2016u\u2016E,curl,1,\u03c9K .\nThen, it follows from the definition of J dK together with (5.42), (5.43) and Lemma 5.11 that\n\u2016J dKu\u2212 Iehu\u2016L2(K) = \u2016Ieh(J dKu\u2212 u)\u2016L2(K)\n\u2264 ( 6\u2211 i=1 \u222b ei |w \u00b7 t|ds+ |e\u0303i|1/2\u2016J d,+K u\u2212 J d,\u2212 K u\u2016L2(e\u0303i) ) \u2016\u03c6ei\u2016L2(K)\n.h1/2K 6\u2211 i=1 (\u2016w+\u2016L1(ei) + \u2016w \u2212\u2016L1(ei)) + (\u2016J d,+ K u\u2016L2(S\u03b42\u2229\u03c9K ) + \u2016J d,\u2212 K u\u2016L2(S\u03b42\u2229\u03c9K )) .hK\u2016u\u2016E,curl,1,\u03c9K + (\u2016J d,+ K u\u2016L2(S\u03b42\u2229\u03c9K ) + \u2016J d,\u2212 K u\u2016L2(S\u03b42\u2229\u03c9K )). (5.44)\nSumming (5.44) over all the interface elements, using the finite overlapping property of \u03c9K , and applying Lemma 5.13 and Theorem 5.1 leads to the desired estimate.\nRemark 5.3. One key in the proof is to use Assumption A3 with the trace inequality for polynomials to control J d,\u00b1K u on edges. If this is done for u \u00b1 E, d, one must be careful about bounding \u2016uE, d\u2016L2(e\u0303) since it may not be well-defined for u \u2208 H1(\u03c9K). Finally, Theorem 5.14 immediately yields the estimate for curl(u\u2212 Iehu), u \u2208 H1(\u03b1, \u03b2, curl; \u2126). Theorem 5.17. Under Assumption A3, for u \u2208 H1(\u03b1, \u03b2, curl; \u2126), there holds\n(5.45) \u2016 curl(u\u2212 Iehu)\u2016L2(\u2126) . h(\u2016u\u2016H1(curl;\u2126\u2212) + \u2016u\u2016H1(curl;\u2126+)).\nProof. Note that div curl u = 0, and thus curl u \u2208 H1(\u03b1,div; \u2126). Then the estimate follows from the commutative property by Lemma 3.5 and Theorem 5.14.\n6. Numerical Experiments. In this section, we present a group of numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. We fix the cubic domain to be \u2126 = (\u22121, 1)3 but with varying interface shapes. The background Cartesian mesh is generated by N3 uniform cubes of which each is partitioned into tetrahedra. In [39] for the 2D case, we have compared the PG formulation with other penalty-type schemes and observed its significant advantages in producing optimal convergent solutions. A similar behavior can be also observed in the 3D case, and here we omit their comparison.\n6.1. Test 1(Stability). In the first test, we study the numerical stability of the method with respect to mesh size and interface location. We first provide a group of numerical estimates for the quantity \u03b7s in (4.9) indicating a lower bound of the inf-sup constant. We consider the spheric interface shape shown in the middle plot of Figure 6.1 for the three groups of parameters.(\nmax(\u03b2+, \u03b2\u2212) min(\u03b2+, \u03b2\u2212) , max(\u03b1+, \u03b1\u2212) min(\u03b1+, \u03b1\u2212)\n) = (200, 100), (200, 1000), (2000, 100)(6.1)\nwhere the minimal values are always set as 1, see the detailed parameter illustration in the right corner of plots in Figure 6.2. Then, we consider a sequence of meshes with N = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70. We plot the values of \u03b7s in Figure 6.2. Here, the computational results for the first two groups of parameters are presented in the first two plots, but for the third group, we separate the parameter (\u03b2+, \u03b1\u2212) = (2000, 100) in a single plot to show more details. Overall, we can see that \u03b7s is bounded below. More specifically, we can make the following numerical observations:\n\u2022 \u03b7s slightly decreases at the beginning, and then the curve proceeds to be flat as the mesh becomes finer. \u2022 \u03b7s highly depends on the contrast of the parameters, and the larger contrast leads to smaller \u03b7s.\nParticularly, the values decrease from the first to the third group of parameters. \u2022 Furthermore, for the third group that the parameters have the ratio (2000, 100), when (\u03b1\u2212, \u03b2+) =\n(100, 2000), \u03b7s \u2248 2.6\u00d7 10\u22123 for the mesh N = 20, which is indeed close to zero. But it turns back to around 0.05 for finer meshes.\nThese observations are consistent with the analysis (cf. [39]) that the inf-sup condition only holds for sufficiently small mesh size.\nNext, we test the condition number of BPG with respect to various interface locations. Consider a flat interface (x \u2212 x0) \u00b7 n = 0 passing through x0 = [ , 0, 0] with = 10\u2212j , j = 1, 2, ..., 6 and the normal vector n = [1, 0, 0]> such that the interface gradually moves to one face/edge of interface elements. Thus the small subelements exist for every interface element. The condition numbers are shown in Table 2 for various . In fact, as the interface element shrinks to a non-interface element, the IFE functions will converge to standard FE functions which is \u201cgood\u201d for computation.\n6.2. Example 2 (Optimal Convergence). In the second test, we investigate the optimal convergence rates with respect to mesh size and speed of the fast solver. Consider a spheric interface with a radius r1 shown in the left plot of Figure 6.1. We still employ (1.3) as the model equation, and use the benchmark example from [39] of which the analytical solution is given by\n(6.2) u =\n{ 1 \u03b2\u2212x + 1 \u03b1\u2212n1R1(x)[(x2 \u2212 x3), (x3 \u2212 x1), (x1 \u2212 x2)]\n> in \u2126\u2212, 1 \u03b2+ x + 1 \u03b1+n2R1(x)R2(x)[(x2 \u2212 x3), (x3 \u2212 x1), (x1 \u2212 x2)] > in \u2126+,\nwhere x = [x1, x2, x3] >, R1(x) = r 2 1 \u2212 \u2016x\u20162, R2(x) = r22 \u2212 \u2016x\u20162, and n1 = n2(r22 \u2212 r21). We let (\u03b1\u2212, \u03b1+) = (\u03b2\u2212, \u03b2+) = (1, 100) and (1, 1000), and denote \u03c1 = \u03b1+/\u03b1\u2212 = \u03b2+/\u03b2\u2212. We present the numerical results for N = 10, ..., 70 in Figure 6.3 which clearly show the optimal convergence rates.\nTo solve the linear system, we employ the preconditioner described in Section 4.2 with both GMRES and CG iteration strategies. Of course, it involves a direct solver on a smaller matrix of which the size depends on the expanding width l, i.e., the size of B (2,2) l in (4.4). But the block diagonal smoother in (4.7) can help in greatly reducing the iteration steps for convergence, and consequently significantly reduce the computational time. In fact, as l is small, in practice we store the LU factorization of B (2,2) l to avoid repeatly compute the inverse. In Table 3, we present both the number of iterations and computational time for GMRES. It is highlighted that the preconditioning strategy even works for a CG method which in general does not converge for non-SPD matrices. The resuls are presented in Table 4, and we can observe that the CG method must need l = 1 at least for convergence. But once the block diagonal smoother in (4.7) is used, the CG method has better performance than GMRES. We may refer to our detailed discussions in Section 4.2, and point out again the important fact that the majority portion of BPG is symmetric, and the problematic portion is only around the interface which can be well-handled by the direct inverse (B (2,2) l )\n\u22121. Overall, for both methods we observe that the expanding width l depends on the contrast \u03c1. For a larger contrast, there needs a relatively larger l to ensure fast convergence. With an appropriately chosen expanding width, the algorithm converges in a small number of iterations which indeed takes significantly less computational time.\n6.3. Example 3 (Application to a time-domain Maxwell equation). In this test, we consider the scattering problem modeled by (1.2) in a time domain [0, T ]. We partition it into M sub-intervals: t0 = 0 < t1 < t2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < tM = T with equal length \u03c4 = T/M . We then apply the implicit time-discretization introduced in [29] which reads\n(6.3) ( \u22022\u03c4u n h,vh)\u2126 + (\u03c3\u2202\u03c4u n h,vh)\u2126 + (\u00b5 \u22121 curl unh, curl vh)\u2126 = (Jt,vh)\u2126, \u2200vh \u2208 Seh, where, for n \u2265 2, \u2202\u03c4unh = (unh \u2212 u n\u22121 h )/\u03c4 and \u2202 2 \u03c4u n h = (\u2202\u03c4u n h \u2212 \u2202\u03c4u n\u22121 h )/\u03c4 . Then, at each time step it can be discretized by the PG-IFE scheme with the parameters \u03b1 = \u00b5\u22121 and \u03b2 = \u03c4\u22122 + \u03c3\u03c4\u22121 and solved with the proposed fast solver. The optimal convergence rates can be also observed if the analytical solution is available, which is omitted for avoiding redundancy. Here, we consider a simulation problem of electromagnetic waves propagating through a torus where the analytical solution is difficult to derive if not impossible, but instead we compare the results of the IFE method and the standard FE method on fitted meshes.\nThe torus interface shown in the right plot of Figure 6.1 is described by a level-set signed-distance function: \u03b3(x) = ( \u221a\n(x1 \u2212 z1)2 + (x2 \u2212 z2)2 \u2212 r2)2 + (x3 \u2212 z3)2 \u2212 r21,\nwhere z1 = z2 = 0, z3 = \u22120.3 and r1 = 0.2, r2 = \u03c0/5. We further set the medium parameters as + = 0.05, \u2212 = 2 +, \u03c3+ = 0.1, \u03c3\u2212 = 1 and \u00b5+ = 4\u03c0, \u00b5\u2212 = 3\u00b5+. Initially, we impose a Gaussian pulse\n(6.4) u = exp(\u2212b(a(x1 \u2212 z0)\u2212 \u03c9t)2)[0, 1, 0]>\nwhere a = \u03c9 \u221a +\u00b5+ modeling the speed of the electromagnetic wave. In addition, the boundary condition is set to match (6.4) except on the faces at x = \u22121, 1 where it is set as 0. Set the source as J = 0, let the time domain be [0, 1.5] and let the step size be \u03c4 = 1.5/128. The IFE method is computed on a 643 unfitted mesh which contains 1572864 elements and 1872064 DoFs, while the simulation of the FE method is performed on a fitted mesh containing 1679542 elements and 2002947 DoFs.\nDenote the numerical solutions by uIFEh and u FE h , respectively. To compare the simulation results, we first plot the evolution of the x2 component at some slices in Figure 6.4 at t = 12\u03c4 , t = 24\u03c4 , t = 36\u03c4 and t = 48\u03c4 . The results of the IFE and FE methods are almost identical demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, we can clearly observe the delayed electromagnetic wave inside the torus agreeing with the physics. Next, we plot the electromagnetic fields inside the torus in Figure 6.5 such that we can also examine the direction. The plots still clearly show that the two methods have very similar simulation results.\nA. Proof of Lemma 2.1. Here, we only show (2.3b), since it can yield (2.3a) by the argument in [38]. Since \u03d5\u0393 is sufficiently smooth, we obtain by the interpolation approximation that\n(A.1) \u2016\u2207\u03d5\u0393 \u2212\u2207\u03d5\u0393h\u2016L\u221e(K) \u2264 ChK\nwhere C depends on the second derivative of \u03d5\u0393. As a signed-distance function, \u03d5\u0393 satisfies \u2016\u2207\u03d5\u0393\u2016 = 1, and thus (A.1) implies\n(A.2) \u2223\u22231\u2212 \u2016\u2207\u03d5\u0393h(x)\u2016\u2223\u2223 \u2264 ChK , \u2200x \u2208 K.\nNote that the unit normal vectors of \u0393 and \u0393Kh are \u2207\u03d5\u0393 and \u2207\u03d5\u0393h/\u2016\u2207\u03d5\u0393h\u2016, respectively.

Proof of Lemma 5.4. Here, we only prove (5.9a) with d = curl, i.e., a = 1, and the others are similar. Let v = u\u2212E \u00d7 n\u0304K \u2212 u + E \u00d7 n\u0304K . Without loss of generality, we define a local system (x\u03021, x\u03022, x\u03023) with x\u03023 being the direction normal to \u0393 \u03c9K h , i.e., n\u0304K , and x\u03021, x\u03022 spanning the plane containing \u0393 \u03c9K h such that the interface surface can be represented by x\u03023 = f(x\u03021, x\u03022) with f being a smooth function. Then,\n(B.1) v(x\u03021, x\u03022, f(x\u03021, x\u03022)) = v(x\u03021, x\u03022, 0) + \u222b f(x\u03021,x\u03022) 0 \u2202x\u03023v(x\u03021, x\u03022, x\u03023) dx\u03023\nwhich, by Ho\u0308lder\u2019s inequality, yields\n\u2016v\u20162 L2(\u0393\n\u03c9K h )\n= \u222b \u0393 \u03c9K h \u2016v(x\u03021, x\u03022, 0)\u20162 dx\u03021 dx\u03022 . \u222b \u0393 \u03c9K h \u2016v(x\u03021, x\u03022, f(x\u03021, x\u03022))\u20162 dx\u03021 dx\u03022\n+ \u222b \u0393 \u03c9K h \u222b f(x\u03021,x\u03022) 0 \u2016\u2202x\u03023v(x\u03021, x\u03022, f(x\u03021, x\u03022))\u20162 dx\u03023|f(x\u03021, x\u03022)|dx\u03021 dx\u03022 (B.2)\nof which the last two integrals are denoted by (I) and (II), respectively. With (5.8), it is clear that\n(B.3) (II) \u2264 max (x\u03021,x\u03022)\u2208\u0393 \u03c9K h |f(x\u03021, x\u03022)|\u2016\u2202x\u03023v\u20162L2(\u03c9K) . h 2 K\u2016\u2207v\u20162L2(\u03c9K).\nAs for (I), we note that \u221a 1 + \u2016\u2207f\u20162 \u2265 1, and thus obtain\n(I) \u2264 \u222b\n\u0393 \u03c9K h\n\u2016v(x\u03021, x\u03022, f(x\u03021, x\u03022))\u20162 \u221a 1 + \u2016\u2207f\u20162 dx\u03021 dx\u03022 = \u222b\n\u0393\u03c9K \u2016v\u20162 ds = \u2016v\u20162L2(\u0393\u03c9K )\n= \u2016(u\u2212E \u2212 u + E)\u00d7 (n\u2212 n\u0304K)\u2016 2 L2(\u0393\u03c9K ) . max \u0393\u03c9K \u2016n\u2212 n\u0304K\u20162\u2016u\u2212E \u2212 u + E\u2016 2 L2(\u0393\u03c9K ) . h2K\u2016u\u2016E,1,\u03c9K (B.4)\nwhere we have used (u\u2212E \u2212 u + E)\u00d7 n = 0 on \u0393\u03c9K , (5.8) and the trace inequality from Lemma 3.1 in [64].\nC. Proof of Lemma 3.1 for a regular tetrahedron. We treat the cases of 3 or 4 intersection points shown in Figure B.1, separatly, where Di are the intersection points of the approximate interface \u0393 K h with the edges. Without loss of generality, we assume the tetrahedron has the vertices A1(0, 0, 0), A2(1, 0, 0), A3(1/2, \u221a 3/2, 0), A4(1/2, \u221a 3/6, \u221a\n6/3). The three faces are chosen as A1A2A3, A1A3A4 and A1A2A4. In addition, for Case 1 we let the intersection points be D1 = d1A2, D2 = d2A3, D3 = d3A4, and for Case 2 we let them be D1 = d1A2, D2 = d2A3, D3 = (1\u2212 d3)A4 + d3A3 and D4 = (1\u2212 d4)A4 + d4A2, where di \u2208 [0, 1], i = 1, 2, 3, 4, are parameters of their location. For Case 2, since Di are coplanar, d4 can be expressed as\n(C.1) d4 = d1d3(d2 \u2212 1)\nd1d2 + d2d3 \u2212 d2 \u2212 d1d3 .\nWe use Mathematica to express the determinant as\n(C.2) det(MK) = f1(d1, d2, d3) + f2(d1, d2, d3)\u03b1\u0303+ f3(d1, d2, d3)\u03b1\u0303\n2\nf0(d1, d2, d3)\nwhere fi(d1, d2, d3), i = 0, 1, 2, 3, are some polynomials of d1, d2, d3. We omit the explicit formulas for the functions fi here since they are complicated. When \u03b1\u0303 = 1, i.e., AK = I, it is straightforward to calculate det(MK) = \u22121/16, and thus\n(C.3) f1(d1, d2, d3) + f2(d1, d2, d3) + f3(d1, d2, d3) = \u2212 1\n16 f0(d1, d2, d3).\nFor Case 1, we can verify that fi(d1, d2, d3) \u2264 0, i = 1, 2, 3 and f0(d1, d2, d3) \u2265 0. Thus, by (C.3) we have\nf1(d1, d2, d3) + f2(d1, d2, d3)\u03b1\u0303+ f3(d1, d2, d3)\u03b1\u0303 2\n\u2264min{\u03b1\u03032, 1} \u2211\ni=1,2,3\nfi(d1, d2, d3) = \u2212 min{\u03b1\u03032, 1}\n16 f0(d1, d2, d3).\n(C.4)\nFor Case 2, we can veriify that fi(d1, d2, d3) \u2265 0, i = 1, 2, 3 and f0(d1, d2, d3) \u2264 0. Similar to (C.4), we obtain\n(C.5) f1(d1, d2, d3) + f2(d1, d2, d3)\u03b1\u0303+ f3(d1, d2, d3)\u03b1\u0303 2 \u2265 \u2212min{\u03b1\u0303 2, 1} 16 f0(d1, d2, d3).\nCombining (C.4) and (C.4), for both cases we arrive at\n(C.6) det(MK) \u2264 \u2212 min{\u03b1\u03032, 1}\n16 < 0.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R.
