On the other hand, the company is also getting a demographic bonus in the form of the number of employees of the millennial generation who should be of a productive age and able to support the company\u2019s performance. The success of an organization is determined by its ability to manage various kinds of resources, one of which is very important, namely human resources. According to Suprapti et al. (2020) and Sunarsi et al. (2021), employees are always attached to any organizational resource as a determining factor for their existence and role in contributing to the achievement of organizational goals effectively and efficiently faced by companies in the coming year will be even more difficult. The Central Statistics Agency (BPS) shows that 50% of workers in Indonesia are <30 years old, which means that millennials are active workers who dominate human resources in an organization. According to Sun and Leithwood (2015) the millennial generation is hope for the company. To have human resources that support the progress of the organization requires high motivation from employees in improving performance. Employee motivation is influenced by the work atmosphere that supports its performance.\nIn several studies, organizational culture is present in providing an indirect influence on employee performance. According to Chan et al. (2019) culture is an important part of the internal environment of an organization. Organizational culture is a set of values, beliefs, behaviors, customs, and attitudes that help members of the organization understand and translate the attitudes that must be taken in dealing with something. Organizational culture plays an important role in influencing the level of motivation of employees to carry out their work. According to Charoensukmongkol and Puyod (2021) and Dewi et al. (2022), there is a clear dependence between organizational culture and employee motivation, where organizational culture must be encouraged to increase employee performance motivation. In addition to a supportive work environment, organizations must have leaders who are able to motivate their members to achieve a goal. Leadership has a big influence on an achievement in the organization. The quality of a leader influences its members to build self-confidence, motivation, and commitment to achieve company goals. According to Direction (2015) andDewi et al. (2022)motivation becomes very important as a\nfactor in achieving employee performance. Motivation affects a person or individual to be involved in activities and work that leads to goals as satisfaction. With this motivation employees have From this background, researchers feel that to improve the performance of millennial employees, research is needed on the relationship between organizational culture and transformational leadership in influencing the performance of next-generation employees millennials through motivation."

This condition can be overcome with motivation from within themselves, the surrounding environment, and inspiration from other people. The motivation that arises in employees makes the enthusiasm to work increase. With increased motivation, employee performance will also increase. According to Kadiyono et al.

In testing the hypothesis, the direct relationship between organizational culture and performance has a significant effect, as can be seen from the value of the hypothesis test obtained in chapter V. However, when testing the mediating relationship between organizational culture and performance through motivation, an insignificant relationship was found. The same results were also found in the results of research conducted by Nguyen and Luu (2019) where the motivational variable did not significantly mediate the relationship between organizational culture and performance. In the research of Noruzy et al. (2013), Nguyen and Luu (2019), Kadiyono et al. (2020), and Muliati et al. (2022) also said that the relationship between organizational culture and employee performance is considered to be indirectly mediated by employee motivation. When viewed from the distribution of answers made by respondents on question points regarding competition in producing work optimally has the highest neutral value from the other questions. This can mean that there are some respondents who are not sure of the motivational drive that comes from organizational culture to improve performance. According to Nguyen and Luu (2019) conducted a study who found an insignificant mediating relationship on organizational culture on performance through motivation. According to Kadiyono et al. (2020) andMuliati et al. (2022) each individual is typically different from one another. Inequality includes needs, desires, interests, values, attitudes, and accepted norms. So it is natural when they have different needs to motivate themselves to achieve good performance. It seems that in this case in addition to taking the company\u2019s core values, efforts are needed to unite the characteristics or personalities that vary among employees into a stronger organizational culture."

In the direct analysis, transformational leadership significantly positively affects employee motivation. That is, the existence of transformational leadership means that transformational leadership has a positive effect on employee motivation. Employeemotivation is increasing but it turns out that this has no impact on their performance.

Suggestions given by researchers include practical advice and academic advice. As a practical suggestion, researchers give advice to companies to create an organizational culture that is oriented toward employee motivation so that companies can map things that can be behind the emergence of motivation in employees, especially in the generation that dominates today, namely the millennial generation. Although the result of the path coefficient value is positive and significant, but it is classified as a fairly low number, it is necessary to study the motivational content in organizational culture. Academic advice from researchers is that for further research, further discussion and analysis can be carried out on the factors that affect employee performance because in this study researchers are still limited to using only two variables as X variables which are adjusted to the needs of the respondents. The novelty of this research is a new model of the relationship between the variables of Transformational leadership, work motivation, culture and employee performance of the millennial generation in the manufacturing industry in the digital era."
