 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further optimize culture conditions like temperature, pH, medium composition etc. to increase EPS yield and productivity from the Lactiplantibacillus plantarum strains isolated in this study. The yields obtained so far are quite low.

2. Study the rheological and texturizing properties of the EPS produced by these strains to evaluate their potential applications as thickeners, stabilizers etc. in different food products. 

3. Evaluate the health benefits and bioactivities like antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory effects of the purified EPS from these strains. This could expand their application to nutraceuticals and functional foods.

4. Perform genome sequencing and comparative genomics of the EPS gene clusters in these strains to identify genes responsible for EPS production. This can help develop metabolic engineering strategies to further improve EPS yields. 

5. Study EPS production in situ during vegetable fermentations using these strains as starter cultures. This can provide insights into industrial scale production and application of EPS directly in foods.
