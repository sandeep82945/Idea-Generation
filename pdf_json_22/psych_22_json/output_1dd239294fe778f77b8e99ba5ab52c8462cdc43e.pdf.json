We assessed the presence of AB in cannabis users with varying use severity and tested models of moderation, mediation and moderated mediation to assess how AB, craving and IC interact in their association with measures of cannabis use. Design: A cross-sectional study design was used. Setting and participants: Eight studies performed by our laboratory in the Netherlands including never-sporadic, occasional (\u2264 1/month) and regular cannabis users (\u2265 2/week), and individuals in treatment for CUD were combined (n = 560; 71% male). Measurements: Studies included a classic Stroop task (IC), a cannabis Stroop task (AB) and measures of session-induced and average session craving. Both heaviness of cannabis use (grams/week) and severity of use related problems were included. Findings: Only those in treatment for CUD showed an AB to cannabis (P = 0.019) and group differences were only observed when comparing CUD with never-sporadic users (P = 0.007). In occasional and regular users, IC was negatively associated with heaviness (\u03b2 = 0.015, P < 0.001), but not severity of use. Average session craving (exploratory), but not session-induced craving (confirmatory), mediated this association between AB and heaviness (\u03b2 = 0.050, P = 0.011) as well as severity of use (\u03b2 = 0.083, P = 0.009); higher AB was associated with heavier use and more severe problems through increased craving. Conclusions: Attentional bias only appears to be present in cannabis users with the most severe problems and craving appears to mediate the association between attentional bias and both heaviness and severity of use in occasional and regular users. The association of interference control with heaviness but not severity of use may point to subacute intoxication effects of cannabis use on interference control.",

We assessed the presence of AB in cannabis users with varying use severity and\ntested models of moderation, mediation and moderated mediation to assess how AB,\ncraving and IC interact in their association with measures of cannabis use.\nDesign: A cross-sectional study design was used.\nSetting and participants: Eight studies performed by our laboratory in the Netherlands\nincluding never-sporadic, occasional (\u2264 1/month) and regular cannabis users (\u2265 2/week),\nand individuals in treatment for CUD were combined (n = 560; 71% male).\nMeasurements: Studies included a classic Stroop task (IC), a cannabis Stroop task\n(AB) and measures of session-induced and average session craving. Both heaviness of\ncannabis use (grams/week) and severity of use related problems were included.\nFindings: Only those in treatment for CUD showed an AB to cannabis (P = 0.019) and\ngroup differences were only observed when comparing CUD with never-sporadic users\n(P = 0.007). In occasional and regular users, IC was negatively associated with heaviness\n(\u03b2 = 0.015, P < 0.001), but not severity of use. Average session craving (exploratory), but\nnot session-induced craving (confirmatory), mediated this association between AB and\nheaviness (\u03b2 = 0.050, P = 0.011) as well as severity of use (\u03b2 = 0.083, P = 0.009); higher\nAB was associated with heavier use and more severe problems through increased\ncraving.\nConclusions: Attentional bias only appears to be present in cannabis users with the most\nsevere problems and craving appears to mediate the association between attentional\nbias and both heaviness and severity of use in occasional and regular users. The associa-\ntion of interference control with heaviness but not severity of use may point to subacute\nintoxication effects of cannabis use on interference control.\nK E YWORD S Attentional bias, cannabis use, cognition, craving, interference control, motivation\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

            "text": "Excessive cannabis use and cannabis use disorder (CUD) are considered major health problems. Trends in cannabis legalization, increasing potency and decreasing harm perceptions [1] highlight the urgency of research into the mechanisms underlying CUD. Traditional theories of addiction propose central roles for both cognitive and motivational processes [2], but research assessing both cognitive and motivational processes and their interactions in cannabis users is lacking.\nThe increased salience of substance-related cues in substance users is thought to bias behaviour towards substance use, which can present itself as a cue-induced attentional bias (AB) and craving [3]. These drug-orientated motivational processes may more easily result in actual substance use in individuals with relatively limited cognitive control [4, 5]. The classical Stroop task has been used to measure cognitive control [6], in which slower responses on incongruent trials, controlled for congruent trials, are an indication of lower IC. Modified drug Stroop tasks have been developed (e.g. Ataya et al. [7]), and the extent to which substance-related (e.g. weed or blunt) relative to matched neutral words (e.g. floor or table) slow down colour-naming is taken as an index of AB, which is expected to relate to substance use [8].\nSeveral studies have investigated the role of IC, AB and craving in cannabis use and CUD. One study, using the classical Stroop to measure IC, found poorer IC and altered brain activity in weekly to daily users relative to non-sporadic using controls when responding to incongruent trials [9]. However, others found no performance differences when comparing near-daily users and controls (e.g. Takagi et al. [10]) or only found differences in task-related brain activity in at-risk and treatment samples (e.g. previous works [11\u201313]). Similarly, AB has been identified in cannabis users ranging from life-time users to those in treatment for CUD [14\u201316], while others do not observe AB using a cannabis Stroop even in near-daily users and those in treatment for CUD [17\u201319]. Craving, however, has consistently been associated with heavier use [20] and has been shown to be predictive of cannabis use and related problems 6 months later [16]. Also, craving has been association with both AB (e.g. Field [21]) and IC (e.g. Cousijn et al. [15]) in studies using the cannabis Stroop and the classical Stroop.\nThese mixed findings could in part be explained by the differential role that AB, craving and IC play across trajectories of cannabis use towards CUD. IC may be lower and AB and craving may be higher in heavier and dependent users [15, 19, 20, 22\u201324]. Unfortunately, most studies look at these constructs separately and have a limited range of cannabis use severity included in the sample. It remains unclear which cannabis users have an AB and how this relates to craving and IC (e.g. Cousijn et al. [16]). Furthermore, a meta-analysis [21] found a small but significant association between AB and craving in substance users, indicating that previous studies might lack power to detect such small effects. To overcome these problems and systematically assess the potential interactions between cognitive and motivational processes in a large sample of cannabis users with variable use frequency, this study combines eight studies conducted in our laboratory that\nincluded a pencil-and-paper version of the classical Stroop and the cannabis Stroop, and similar assessments of craving.\nFirst, focusing on AB, we will assess whether groups of neversporadic users, occasional users, regular users and those in treatment for CUD show an AB towards cannabis cues and whether AB differs between these groups. We expect an AB in regular users and those in treatment for CUD only, that differs from the never-sporadic users [20]. In occasional and regular users, excluding the CUD group to avoid effects of recent cessation on the outcomes, we will assess whether AB, craving, IC, heaviness of current use and severity of cannabis use-related problems are indeed associated with each other in this broad range of users.\nSecondly, we will assess how the cannabis AB, craving and IC interact in their association with heaviness and severity of cannabis use. We will test different theory-informed models; we will assess whether AB, craving and/or IC are predictive of heaviness of cannabis use and/or severity of cannabis use-related problems (Figure 1a; e.g. Kroon et al. [25]). We will then assess the proposed moderating role of cognitive processes in overcoming motivational urges [4, 5] (Figure 1b,c). AB could increase craving or vice versa, subsequently leading to increased cannabis use or use-related problems (e.g. Field et al. [3, 26]). Therefore, we will also separately assess whether AB or craving act as a mediator in the association between the other variable with heaviness of use and severity of cannabis-use-related problems (Figure 1d,e). Then, to combine these moderation and mediation models, we will assess whether IC moderates the association of craving and/or AB with heaviness/severity cannabis use in the proposed mediation models (Figure 1f,g)."

To account for differences in measures across studies, session-induced (SI) craving (start\u2013end score) and an exploratory measure of average session (AS) craving were calculated before the scores were standardized within each scale and combined into single measures of AS and SI\ncraving. Comparability of the MCQ and VAS craving scores was assessed in a subsample (n = 40) in which both were collected during the same session, showing a moderate to high within-person correlation between the AS craving scores (r = 0.806, P < 0.001) as well as SI craving scores (r = 0.500, P = 0.001) as calculated from the VAS and MCQ. Furthermore, VAS and MCQ were similarly associated with the measures of cannabis use included in this study (Supporting information, Table S2).\nClassical Stroop: interference control\nThe classical Stroop task included three different cards that were presented in a fixed order [6, 33].

Thirdly, participants were instructed to name the incongruent colour in which the words red, green, blue and yellow were printed (colour-word card). Reaction-times were recorded using a stopwatch and IC scores were calculated using this formula: reaction-time colour-word card/[(reaction-time word card + reaction-time colour card)/2] [34]. Higher scores indicated lower IC.\nCannabis Stroop: attentional bias\nThe cannabis Stroop task included two different cards presented in counterbalanced order [16]. Each card included eight rows of seven words that were all printed in red, green, blue or yellow. The words on both cards were matched on word length and number of syllables, but on one card the words were neutral (e.g. poster), while the words on the other card were cannabis-related (e.g. stoned). Participants were instructed to name the colour in which each word was printed, row by row, from left to right, as fast as they could. A stopwatch was used to record the time needed to complete each card. AB scores were calculated using the following formula: reaction-time cannabis card \u2013 reaction-time neutral card, with higher scores being indicative of a relatively higher bias for cannabis words."

Individuals who did not fit any of these groups (n = 8) were excluded (Supporting information, Table S1). IC, AB, craving, grams/week of use and CUDIT-R scores that were more than 3 standard deviations from the mean were excluded to reduce effects of measurement error (e.g. implausibly high levels of cannabis use or IC scores indicative of potential methodological problems).\nAttentional bias\nOne-sample t-tests were run to assess whether there was an AB to cannabis words (whether the AB was different from zero) per group. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to assess group differences in AB, with post-hoc independent-sample t-tests to explore the differences. Then, in all occasional and regular users, correlation analyses were conducted to assess how heaviness of cannabis use (grams/week), severity of cannabis use-related problems (CUDIT-R score), AB, IC and SI craving were associated with each other. The attentional bias analyses as described above were conducted in JASP (version 0.14.1.0 [35]).\nAttentional bias, interference control and craving: their association with cannabis use\nOnly current occasional and regular users were included in the following analyses (Table 1; excluding the CUD group due to potential effects of recent cessation). Simple and multiple regression analyses were conducted to assess whether AB, IC and/or SI craving were predictive of heaviness of cannabis use and severity of cannabis use-related problems (Figure 1a). Moderation analyses were conducted to assess whether IC moderates the association between SI craving (Figure 1b) or AB (Figure 1c) and heaviness of cannabis use and severity of cannabis use-related problems. Then, to assess the proposed relation between AB and SI craving in their association with cannabis use outcomes, we ran a mediation analysis to determine whether AB mediates the association between SI craving and heaviness of cannabis use or severity of cannabis userelated problems (Figure 1d) or the reverse (Figure 1e, Supporting information, Figure S5A). Combining this, moderated-mediation analyses were run to assess whether IC moderates the association between SI craving and AB with heaviness of cannabis use or cannabis use related problems in the proposed mediation models (Figure 1f,g and Supporting information, Figure S5B). All included variables were mean-centred. Additional exploratory analyses were conducted replacing SI craving with AS craving. The models as described above were run in R (version 4.1.2 [36]) creating the models (Figure 1b\u2013g) using the processR (version 0.2.6 [37]) package and running them in lavaan (version 0.6-9 [38]) using maximum likelihood estimation.

Exploratory sensitivity analyses, adding the variables that differed between groups (Table 1) as covariates in an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), showed that the effect was independent of age and IC but no longer significant after correction for AUDIT and FTND.\nFocusing upon occasional and regular users, correlational analysis revealed a positive association between heaviness of cannabis use (gram/week) and severity of cannabis use (CUDIT-R scores; rs (347) = 0.49, Pbonf < 0.001). CUDIT-R score was not associated with any of the other variables (highest rs = 0.10, with uncorrected P = 0.06), but gram/week was positively associated with classical\nStroop scores (rs(343) = 0.20, Pbonf < 0.001), indicating worse IC in more severe users.

            "text": "We assessed the presence of AB in cannabis users with different levels of use and how AB interacted with craving and IC in its relationship with heaviness and severity of cannabis use. A clear strength of this study is the inclusion of a large sample with a large range of cannabis use severity (n = 560). Only those users in treatment for CUD\nshowed an AB to cannabis (significantly > 0), which was significantly higher compared to never-sporadic users, but not compared to occasional and regular users. Poorer IC was consistently associated with heavier cannabis use, but not the severity of use-related problems. However, in contrast to our hypotheses, IC did not moderate the association between AB and craving in their association with measures of cannabis use. Moreover, SI craving did not mediate the association between AB (or vice versa) and measures of cannabis use, but results changed when using average craving instead; craving mediated the association between AB and heaviness as well as severity of use.\nOur results suggest that AB may be a clinical marker of CUD severity, while IC may generally be poorer in heavier users regardless of CUD problem severity. However, the associations between AB, craving IC and cannabis use are complex. Looking at Figure 1, AB appears higher in more frequent users, but AB did not directly relate to our measures of cannabis use (also not when exploratively including the CUD group in the regression analysis). It only related through its positive association with craving; those with higher AB might have higher, potentially more \u2018trait-like\u2019 levels of craving, triggering a higher general likelihood to use. Most studies indicate that the relationship between craving and AB is probably reciprocal [3]; however, our results in which AB affects use through craving are in line with earlier research in alcohol users in which training to increase AB resulted in increased craving and subsequent use [39]. The indirect effects of AB via craving could also explain why some studies did not find direct associations between AB and measures of use (e.g. alcohol Stroop [24]; cocaine Stroop [40]). However, our findings are cross-sectional and were only significant for average craving, not SI craving.

[41]) and could indicate its potential value as a clinical marker. However, research evaluating the relevance of assessing AB for other substance use disorders in clinical settings are inconsistent (e.g. Field et al. [26] and Christiansen et al. [42])\u2014while some studies show AB to be associated with worse treatment outcomes or increased relapse rate (heroin [43]; cocaine [44]; alcohol [45]), this is not the case in all studies (cocaine [43]; tobacco [46])\u2014and studies on the value of AB as a marker of CUD severity and treatment outcomes are largely lacking. Hence, further research is required to systematically assess the clinical relevance of AB to cannabis cues in clinical and non-clinical samples of cannabis users.\nIt must be noted that the group differences disappeared when controlling for AUDIT and FTND. Polysubstance use is extremely common [47], and the higher use of alcohol and tobacco might arise from the same underlying factors as their heavy cannabis use (e.g. Field [21] and Pennington et al. [48]). Including AUDIT and FTND as covariates is suboptimal for it probably deletes cannabis userelevant variance. Furthermore, it seems theoretically unlikely that alcohol and tobacco use directly affect AB for cannabis words, but further research with samples (more closely) matched on these variables are needed to confirm this.\nPartially in line with our expectations, we consistently found lower IC to be associated with heavier cannabis use (small\u2013medium effect; rs = 0.20). While it is often argued that this could indicate of a lack of control over use [4, 5], the lack of association with severity of cannabis use-related problems and the lack of interactions with AB and craving may indicate that this association is a result of the current heaviness of use and associated subacute effects. Some earlier studies also failed to find a moderating role if IC (e.g. Cousijn et al. [15] and van Kampen et al. [19]). Cannabis intoxication has been found to negatively affect Stroop performance (e.g. Hooker & Jones [49]) and there is evidence that several cognitive functions recover with increased abstinence (e.g. Crean et al. [50]). In line with this, an exploratory check in the CUD group, of which the majority have been abstinent for multiple days (53% at least 7 days of abstinence), showed that there is no association between IC and heaviness of use in the CUD group (Supporting information, Table S10). Further research is needed to assess (sub)acute effects and the potential for recovery.\nA few limitations of this study should be noted. While combining different studies increases the sample size and allows for more complex models to be tested, it potentially introduces differences in experimenter effects and methodology between studies. However, the classical and cannabis Stroop methodology was the same throughout studies and it is likely that experimenter variability was as large within some studies as between them [in line with low (\u2264 0.126) ICC]. Differences between sessions might particularly have affected the results of SI craving, as they differed in length and content aside from the measures included in our analysis. It must be noted that all standardized craving scores were based on two different measures of\ncraving. While subsample analyses showed that within-person associations between the measures were moderate to high and displayed similar associations with cannabis use outcomes, it is unclear how this approach could have affected the results. Also, the difference in the results between SI and average craving highlight the potential influence of the chosen outcome, even when calculated from the same measures, and the potential incomparability of the results of studies using different outcome measures. Replication of our results using a single measure of craving but using both average session craving and SI craving as outcomes is warranted. Furthermore, it must be investigated whether our results generalize to other measures of cognitive functioning and AB and whether these effects generalize to more ecologically valid situations in which AB could affect craving and cannabis use.\nOur results indicate that AB as measured by the cannabis Stroop might only be present in those cannabis users with the most severe problems, but that greater AB could be associated with higher craving and, in turn, higher cannabis use and related problems even in less severe cannabis users. While systematic research into the clinical relevance of these associations is crucial, these results highlight the potential importance of AB in both heaviness and severity of cannabis use as well as the mechanisms by which AB through increased craving could affect efforts to reduce or stop using cannabis."
