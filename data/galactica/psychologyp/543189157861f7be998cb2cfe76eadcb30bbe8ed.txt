Methods: The hepatoprotective effect of CR against cholestasis liver injury induced by α-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) was evaluated in rats. The serum biochemical indices, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bile acid (TBA), total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 1β (IL-1β), as well as the liver oxidative stress indexes and the pathological characteristics of the liver were analyzed. In addition, we also performed a serum metabolomics study using UPLC-Q Exactive HF-X technology to investigate the effect of CR on the serum of rats with ANIT-induced IC and screened potential biomarkers. The enrichment analysis of differential expressed genes (DEGs) was performed by transcriptomics. Finally, the regulatory targets of CR on potential biomarkers were obtained by combined analysis, and the relevant key targets were verified by western blotting. open access  edited by Junmin Zhang, Lanzhou University, China reviewed by Xuan Qin, Baylor College of Medicine, United States Runbin Sun, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, China
