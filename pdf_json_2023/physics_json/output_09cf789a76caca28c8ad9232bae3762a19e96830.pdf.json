But due to the cytotoxicity and drug-resistance problems encountered with many available treatments, it has become important to discover and develop highly effective drugs to treat cancer.1,5 Over 60% of conventional anticancer drugs have originated from natural sources.6 Sugars, being natural are an important class of biomolecules which act as building blocks for numerous biologically active compounds and they have been proven as an untapped source of new drug molecules, offering new\nistry, University of Delhi, Delhi-110007,\nUniversity of Delhi, Delhi-110007, India esearch, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India llege, University of Delhi, Delhi-110007,\n, University of Delhi, Delhi, India tion (ESI) available.

In the past few decades, this motif has drawn attention in medicinal chemistry due to its biological and pharmaceutical activities such as anti-cancer, antifungal, anti-HIV, anti-inammatory, antioxidant and antibacterial etc.11\u201315 Some of the pyrano[3,2-c] pyranones were used for the treatment of skin and antineurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.16,17 Moreover, this structure constituted building blocks for many natural products found in plants,18\u201320 where some of them showed high potency towards biological activities.21 For instance, triptiliospinocoumarin (A),22 vismiaguian A (B),23 pyripyropene T (C),24 were found naturally while synthetic compound D25 was cytotoxic to neuroblastoma and melanoma cells. The tricyclic E 26\u2013F 17 might be utilised for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease.

The values become more concerned when these individual reactions employ simple reagents, proceed smoothly, avoid complex separation in work-up procedures and enable favourable overall yields. Herein, we report a small library of two series of sugar fused pyrano[3,2-c]pyranone derivatives, which were afforded stereo-specically in excellent yields starting from natural sugars i.e. D-galactose and D-glucose. No requirement of high temperature, short reaction time for the synthesis of these privileged compounds in diastereomeric pure form are the key factors of present synthesis."

This synthetic methodology involved 2-C-formyl glycals and 4-hydroxy coumarins as starting materials which were reacted in toluene\u2013AcOH solvent mixture, using pyrrolidine as catalyst, when a diastereomeric mixture (50 : 50) was afforded for 2-C-formyl glucal.\nHowever, 2-C-formyl galactal showed a better diasteroselectivity and the mixture was obtained in 99 : 1 ratio (Scheme 1).28,29 It was also observed that elevated temperature helped the reaction to achieve the desired products in high yields.\nOn this occasion, we undertook a similar reaction on 1-Cformyl glycals. The primary objective of this investigation was to eliminate the diastereoselectivity in the resulting product and additionally assess the biological activity of a single isomer of these sugar-fused pyrano[3,2-c]pyranones. Hence, our reaction methodology consisted of reaction between 1-C-formyl glycal and 4-hydroxy coumarins in ethyl acetate solvent system, where\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nL-proline was used as catalyst. Under this reaction conditions, stereoselective single isomer formation was observed in case of both gluco- and galacto-derivatives of 1-C-formyl glycal (Scheme 1). Herein, the reaction proceeded well at room temperature and there was no requirement of higher temperature. In fact, the progress of the reaction was noted even at 5 \u00b0C. Comparatively, a better yield was afforded by this procedure in comparison to the previously mentioned literature procedures (Scheme 1). The sugar fused pyrano[3,2-c]pyranone derivatives synthesized following this method had C\u2013C bond at anomeric position of sugar moiety, instead of C\u2013O bond as was observed in the previous case, which guided us to categorise these molecules as C-glycosides. The structural alteration resulting from transformation of anomeric centre from C\u2013O acetal to strong C\u2013C bond in C-glycosides would stimulate the resistance of these molecules towards chemical/enzymatic hydrolysis and/or metabolic processes, which might enable them to be potent biologically active candidate.30\nIt was envisioned that the reaction of 1-C-formylglycal with 4- hydroxy coumarin could generate the desired pyrano[3,2-c]pyranone derivatives through C-1,2 nucleophilic addition followed by 6p-electrocyclization reaction. The pioneer reaction was carried out by Link and his co-workers,31,32 in the year 1944. Later, this reaction condition was explored by many research groups in attempt to synthesize variety of natural products and biologically active molecules.33\u201336 It was noted that the researchers faced challenges in terms of stereoselectivity, reaction time, temperature, isolated yield and substrate scope etc. while carrying out this reaction. Therefore, there was a constant need to develop an efficient and stereo-controlled method for the synthesis of pyrano[3,2-c]pyranones.\nIn our research work, we started the synthetic methodology with cheap and naturally available sugar molecules i.e. D-galactose and D-glucose. These natural sugars were transformed into C-glycopyranosyl aldehydes 1a\u2013b following a reaction methodology consisting six steps, which afforded the compounds in 41\u2013 55% overall yields.37 Next, these sugar aldehydes 1a\u2013b were treated with sodium methoxide in methanol at room temperature to afford 1-C-formyl glycals 2a\u2013b in 90\u201392% yields.

Thus, startingmaterials 1-C-formyl galactal 2a and 4-hydroxy coumarin 3a in presence of catalyst L-proline in toluene\u2013acetic acid solvent system at 25 \u00b0C afforded desired sugar fused pyrano[3,2-c]pyranone 4a in 68% yield (entry 1, Table 1). The crude product was puried by column chromatography using ethyl acetate and petroleum ether as the solvent system to obtain the pure compound as a solid material. 1H and 13C NMR spectra of crude product indicated the presence of only one isomer, inferring that the reaction was absolutely stereoselective. However, as the isolated yield was only 68%, there was need to improve the isolated yield. Thereaer, the catalyst and solvent system were kept same and optimization was done at higher temperatures i.e. 80 \u00b0C, 120 \u00b0C and 150 \u00b0C, which afforded the desired product in 55, 42 and 30% yields, respectively (entries 2\u20134, Table 1). It implicated that, with the raise in temperature, the yield of product was decreasing. It was concluded that the room temperate i.e. 25 \u00b0C would be optimum temperature to obtain higher yield. Next, catalyst was changed i.e. pyrrolidine was used which also did not show any promising effect on product yield (entry 5, Table 1). It was also observed that there was a slight increment in obtained yield as the temperature went down to 25 \u00b0C. So, catalyst Lproline was reconsidered as the chosen catalyst at temperature 25 \u00b0C, which afforded a higher yield (78%) (entry 5, Table 1).\n24606 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 24604\u201324616\nFurther, solvent system was changed to ethyl acetate while retaining L-proline as catalyst at 25 \u00b0C, which produced the desired product in 91% yield (entry 6, Table 1). When the reaction was carried out without the catalyst L-proline, only trace of product was observed (entry 7, Table 1). Next, we used the polar solvents like DMSO, DMF, MeOH, EtOH and found that the former two solvents were inefficient for the product formation and later two solvents afforded the desired product with very poor yield (entries 8\u201311, Table 1). All other non-polar solvents like benzene, THF, MeCN, DCM, dioxane, acetone were also proved less effective for the conversion of starting material into product (entries 12\u201319, Table 1). Furthermore, an alternative greener solvent, iso-propyl acetate, was employed instead of ethyl acetate. However, the resulting yield was slightly lower compared to the yield obtained with ethyl acetate (entry 20, Table 1).\nThe optimised reaction conditions i.e. L-proline as catalyst in ethyl acetate at 25 \u00b0C was used for the reaction of 2a with nine other freshly prepared differently substituted 4-hydroxy coumarins 3a\u2013i38 to afford sugar fused pyrano[3,2-c]pyranones 4a\u2013i in excellent yields (Scheme 2).\nSimilarly, the designed protocol was also applied on 1-Cformyl glucal 2b and interestingly, here also only one stereoisomer was observed on TLC, which was nally conrmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectra of crude product.

The MTT assay of epirubicin at different concentration was observed for both cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 (ESI\u2020). We further investigated if this anti-proliferative activity was the result of apoptotic mechanisms. MCF-7 cells treated with all the four compounds 5c, 5g, 5h and 5i at 20 to 120 mM showed altered morphology, cellular shrinkage, chromatin condensation and cell death which are the characteristics of apoptosis (Fig. 5 & ESI\u2020).\nApoptosis is initiated with morphological changes. The characteristic of the apoptotic cell include chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation, plasma membrane blabbing and cell shrinkage. Ultimately the cells breaks into small fragments (apoptotic bodies).40 Herein for apoptosis analysis, MCF7 & MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded into 96 well plate, incubated for up to 70\u201390% conuency then treated with different concentrations of compounds (5c, 5g, 5h, and 5i) for 24 hours.

Images were taken in blue and green monochromatic light by inverted uorescence microscope at 10\u00d7 magnication. Result showed gradually increased no. of apoptotic cells from 20 mM to 120 mM compound concentration in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and it is highly signicant at 100 mM and 120 mM in 5c (P < 0.0001), 5g (P < 0.0011, P < 0.0012), 5h (P < 0.0001) and 5i (P < 0.0004, P < 0.0010) treated MCF-7 cells (Fig. 6).

However, there is no signicant migration inhibition was observed on MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer cell line (results are attached in ESI\u2020). One of the most signicant somatically mutated oncogenes in human cancer is the MYC transcription factor. MYC somatic amplication and overexpression are exceedingly frequent in human tumours and are linked to poor prognosis in a variety of human tumour types. Deregulation of the MYC pathway is one of the most frequent characteristics of human carcinogenesis since the majority of transforming oncogenes eventually drive MYC expression either directly or indirectly. The MYC oncoprotein gives cancer cells a selective advantage in a variety of situations by encouraging cell survival, proliferation, differentiation blockage, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and genetic instability, all of which may indirectly aid metastasis.42,45 In this study we have used glucal fused pyrano[3,2-c] pyranones compounds 5c, 5g, 5h and 5i for the migration analysis. It might be possible that these compounds regulated the myc gene expression which in turn inhibited the migration of MCF-7 cells."

            "text": "Efficacies of 18 compounds are evaluated by using MTT-assay for their anticancer role in breast cancer cell lines in MCF-7 & MDA-MB-231. DMSO used to make a 100 mM stock of compounds. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (5 \u00d7 103 cells per well) were seeded into 96 well plates and incubate for 24 hours. A gradient of drug concentrations (20 mM, 40 mM, 60 mM, 80 mM, 100 mM, 120 mM) were added for 24 hours of treatment. Treated cells and controls were stained with MTT dye (5 mg mL\u22121) for 4 hours then cell lysis done by using cell lysis solution (SDS and HCL solution). Optical density (OD) value was measured at 570 nm wavelength in micro-plate reader. Experiments were performed in triplicate. The percent cell viability was calculated by using the following formula:46\nPercentage cell viability = OD of experiment sample\n\u00d7 100/OD of the control.\nCell morphology analysis (cytotoxic assay)\nIn the continuation cytotoxicity of all these compounds, we have evaluated cell morphology. MCF-7 & MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were cultured and 1 \u00d7 103 cells per well were seeded into six well plates in DMEM media with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics, incubated for 24 hours. Further cells were treated with these compounds with various concentrations (0 mM, 20 mM, 40 mM, 60 mM, 80 mM, 100 mM, 120 mM) for 24 hours and images were captured by inverted phase contrast microscope at 10\u00d7 resolution. Cytotoxicity of these compounds was evaluated by morphology of these cells. Adhere, irregular and triangle shape structures are live cells whereas round spherical shape structures denote stressed and death induced cells. Whereas, round and oating cells in the medium are dead cells.47\nApoptosis assay by (Etbr/acridin orange staining)\nMCF-7 & MD-MB-231 cells (5 \u00d7 103 cells per well) were seeded into 96-well plate and incubated for 24 hours. A gradient of active compound concentrations (0 mM, 20 mM, 40 mM, 60 mM, 80 mM, 100 mM, 120 mM) were used for treatment of seeded cells for 24 hours at 37 \u00b0C at 5% CO2 conditions. Cells were xed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30min, cells were washed with 1\u00d7 PBS followed by staining with 1mgmL\u22121 AO/EtBr for 10 minutes and washed again with 1\u00d7 PBS. Images of the cells were captured by an inverted uorescence microscope at 485 nm wavelength and at 10\u00d7 magnication. Images were analysed by ImageJ soware and apoptosis cells no. were counted and graphs were plotted by using GraphPad Prism 5.48\nMigration assay (wound healing assay)\nMCF-7 & MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (5\u00d7 105 cells per well) are seeded into 6-well plate, maintained till 100% conuence.

            "text": "A series of novel sugar fused pyrano[3,2-c]pyranone derivatives were achieved using an efficient and facile one pot condensation reaction between 1-C-formyl glycals and substituted 4- hydroxy coumarins. Reactions were carried out at room temperature (25 \u00b0C) in ethyl acetate by stirring for \u223c1\u20132 h in presence of L-proline to obtain exclusively single diastereomer of pyrano[3,2-c]pyranone derivatives. The reactions went smoothly in a stereoselective manner and produced only one diastereomer exclusively for each of these derivatives. No requirement of high temperature, shortened reaction time and high yields made the protocol attractive. A total of eighteen compounds were synthesized following the methodology. We have screened all eighteen compounds for the anticancer activity. In this study we have selected MCF-7 cell line as an Estrogen Receptor (ER) and Progesterone Receptor (PR) +ve cells with Her-2 gene \u2212ve breast cancer subtype against that these active compounds (5c, 5g, 5h, and 5i) showed signicant antitumor effect. However, MDA-MB-231 is an ER, PR, and Her2 gene \u2212ve cell lines represent triple \u2212ve subtype of breast cancer is known as highly aggressive subtype where these compounds are not effective."
