INTRODUCTION\nThe Penrose process (PP) [1] is one of the remarkable physical effects typical of general relativity and other theories of gravity. Let us suppose that in a space-time there exists a region (called ergosphere) where the Killing energy E measured at infinity can be negative. If a particle 0 within the ergosphere splits to two fragments 1 and 2, one of them can have E1 < 0. Then, the conservation of energy entails that the second fragment has E2 > E0, so some energy gain occurs. This is just the PP. However, it has a quite modest efficiency in realistic astrophysics. Its efficiency increases if instead of decay of one particle the process consists in collision of different particles. Such a process with energy gain is called the\n\u2217Electronic address: zaslav@ukr.net\n2 collisional Penrose process (see Ref. [2] for review and references therein).\nEspecially, it is relevant in the context of another effect that is called the Ban\u0303ados-SilkWest (BSW) one [3]. It happens if particles collide near the black hole. Then, under certain conditions the energy Ec.m. in the center-of-mass frame becomes unbounded. Meanwhile, the gain in the energy E remains bounded [4] - [6].\nOriginally, all these effects were found in the vicinity of rotating black holes. However, the similar effect should occur in the background of static charged black holes [7]. It was investigated further in detail [8] - [11]. Moreover, there exists a limit to flat space-time when the effect under discussion persists [12], [13]. It amounts to the possibility of indefinitely large energy gain when E is formally unbounded (in the test particle approximation , when backreaction on a metric is neglected). Then, such a process is called the super-Penrose one (SPP). In contrast to collisions of neutral particles near rotating black holes where the SPP is forbidden (see, e.g. Ref. [14] and references therein), the SPP is indeed possible for the charged black holes, even for pure radial particle motion in the Reissner-Nordstro\u0308m (RN) background [15], [16]. (More general scenarios can include both the electric charge and rotation [17].)\nIn the present work, we show that there exists one more type of the SPP. It is realized in the background of naked charged singularities. The SPP near naked singularities was already the subject of study for rotating geometries with neutral particles. In [18], it was shown that the SPP is possible for the Kerr overspinning metric when particles move within the equatorial plane. In [19], this result was generalized to generic rotating axially symmetric space-times with naked singularities. In [20], high energy extraction in the Kerr overspinning geometry was investigated for particle collisions taking place on the off-equatorial planes. These papers share two common features: (i) the unbounded (or at least very high) energy extraction requires fine-tuning between the parameters of geometry, so it is on a threshold of forming a horizon (but the horizon does not form), (ii) the effect under discussion implies the collisional Penrose process.\nWe would like to stress that in the scenarios considered in the present work, both conditions are relaxed: the effect is achieved for quite generic geometries without special conditions for particles and, also, it happens for the decay typical of the standard Penrose process instead of the collisional one.\nThe process with charged particles in the RN background discussed in the present work\n3 differs not only from its counterpart in the rotating backgound with neutral particles but also from its analogs near the RN naked singularity considered earlier [21], [22]. In aforementioned papers (i) collisions of shells were studied, (ii) the high energy process implies high Ec.m. Meanwhile, we show that (i) the effect under discussion is valid for test particles, (ii) it involves ultra-high energies E, (iii) there are no collisions at all and the process represents a standard PP, not a collisional one.\nThere is one more interesting property inherent to the scenarios considered in the present paper. The examples of the electric SPP, known before, share the common feature. If one wants to gain large energy, the electric charge is also should be large. This concerns both the standard and collisional PP as well as the confined one [23]. However, the electric charge of elementary particles, atoms or nuclei cannot be arbitrary large [15], [24]. Also, there exist similar restrictions for macroscopic bodies [16]. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that for naked singularities not only PP but also SPP does exist for a finite value of a particle charge.\nWe use the geometric system of units in which fundamental constants G = c = 1."

(19)\nIt follows from (13) that D \u2265 0. The equality holds if m0 = m1 +m2 only. The solutions (14) - (19) are classified according to 4 quantities (\u03c32, h2, h1, \u03b4). The corresponding allowed combinations are listed in eq. (30) of [25]. (A reader should bear in mind that the role of particle 3 in [25] is played now by particle 2). Here,\nh1 = sgnH1, H1 = \u2206+ \u221a f \u2212 2m1X0, (20)\nh2 = sgnH2, H2 = \u2206\u2212 \u221a f \u2212 2m2X0. (21)\nWe are interested in the situation when particle 2 escapes. If it moves after decay immediately to infinity, \u03c32 = +1. We will consider this type of scenario first. (Afterwards, we will also discuss an alternative scenario when particle 2 bounces back from the potential barrier.)\nThen, according to [25], there are only two possibilities: 1(+,+,+,\u2212) and 2(+,+,\u2212,\u2212). Thus \u03b4 = \u22121 and we should also have\nH2 > 0 (22)\nwhile H1 can have any sign.\n6"

            "heading": "VII. DISCUSSION: COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF HIGH",
            "text": "ENERGY PROCESSES\nIt is instructive to compare the obtained results with those already existing in literature, both for the rotating and static charged case. Usually, the outcome of particle collisions depends strongly on several factors: (i) the parameters of geometry, (ii) parameters of particles, (iii) direction of motion. Let us remind a reader at first the situation for processes with neutral particles in the background of rotating black holes. If one wants to have unbounded Ec.m. for collision of particles falling from infinity, a black hole, typically, has to be extremal. This implies a special relation between the mass M and angular momentum a of a black hole: a = M (in corresponding units) for the Kerr metric. Also, one of particles should be fine-tuned (so-called critical) which implies a special relation between the parameters of a particle itself [3]. However, even with unbounded Ec.m., the energy E remains quite modest [4] - [6]. It can be significantly increased if a fine-tuned particle is outgoing [26], [27]. However, the energy E remains bounded anyway.\nIf collision occurs in the field of a naked singularity, there is no need in fine-tuning particle parameters but the geometry itself should be on the threshold of forming a horizon [18], [19], [20]. For example, for the Kerr metric a has to be only slightly bigger than M . Alternatively, one can try to relax the requirement of having the extremal black hole and consider the Schnittman scenario [26] (collision between an infalling and outgoing particles) even for the nonextremal one. However, in this case, the input of energy should be very large from the very beginning, that depreciates the value of the process [28]. Meanwhile, in the current setup, neither geometry nor particles should be fine-tuned. Also, the relative direction of motion is irrelevant. Although details of the process look different for each separate scenario, the SPP turns out to be possible almost for all scenarios considered above.\n12\nOne can also compare our problem with collisions of charged particles near the RN black hole. One should require one of infalling particles to be a critical as well. If both particles are usual (not fine-tuned), neither unbounded Ec.m. or unbounded E are possible [15], [16], [17]. And, for the critical particle there is a bound on the electric charge q < Ze, where e is the value of an elementary charge and Z = 170 comes from quantum electrodynamics. As the energy of a particle produced in collision turns out to be proportional to the charge q [15], this gives rise to the restriction of the efficiency of the PP. But this circumstance is irrelevant in the case under discussion since high energies can be obtained even for a modest electric charge.\nAnd, the last but not the least, there is no necessity in arranging the collisional Penrose process for achieving the SPP. A standard decay of one particle is quite sufficient. Thus, a naked singularity provides us with the most favorable situation for gaining energy and accelerating particles to ultrahigh energies."

            "text": "As is known, the electric charge of astrophysical objects is rather small. (Although it can, in principle, lead to observable effects [29].) However, in some aspects the electrical charge can model what happens in more complicated realistic astrophysical systems with rotation. Meanwhile, the RN metric is much easier for analysis than, say, the Kerr metric describing the vacuum solution of the Einstein equations with rotation. In this sense, the results obtained in the present paper can be of some use for the analysis of more realistic processes.\nThey are also interesting on their own right. We found one more type of systems for which the SPP is possible. It exists in almost all scenarios considered above. In the configuration considered in the present paper (i) the SPP can occur without fine-tuning at all and (ii) to gain large E, there is no need to have large q. More precisely, fine-tuning is required for the subcase with the turning point (38) only but is absent if such a point is missing. One more difference between the present version of SPP and that near a black hole consists in that now the original particle needs not be ultrarelativistic having any finite value \u03b5 > 1 (cf. Sec. IV C3 in [24]). In this sense, the present version of the SPP is less restrictive than the previous one typical of the BSW effect. We would also like to stress that the effect under\n13\ndiscussion concerns indefinitely large Killing energy E, whereas Ec.m. is irrelevant since we considered particle decay, not collision.\nIn combination with the previous results [7], [8], [15], [12], [13], this means that any type of the Reissner-Nordstro\u0308m space-time (black hole, flat space-time as its limit, naked singularity) is pertinent to the SPP.\n[1] R.
