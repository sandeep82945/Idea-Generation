            "text": "\u201cListen to the patient; he is telling you the diagnosis\u201d is an aphorism that has been attributed to William Osler, but whose Oslerian provenance, I have suggested, is doubtful.1 My view about this is partly conditioned by the fact that Osler\u2019s clinical style was to concentrate more on observation and examination than on the patient\u2019s tale, important though that is. I have also suggested that patients do not generally volunteer all the relevant facts in the case, spontaneously recounting only the bare bones of the problem, and that careful, sensitive history taking is necessary to flesh out all the details, turning the tale into a narrative that will lead to at least a differential diagnosis, which can then be supplemented by observation, examination, and relevant investigations.2\nThe meaning of the word \u201cdiagnosis,\u201d literally thorough knowledge, is also fluid. \u201cDiabetes,\u201d for example, is an incomplete diagnosis. At the simplest level, one has to specify whether it is diabetes insipidus or diabetes mellitus. If the latter, one needs to differentiate at least between types 1 and 2, not to mention uncommon variants, such as the several subtypes of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY).3 In cases of type 2 diabetes mellitus one might also want to specify, as part of the diagnosis, whether insulin is needed.\nSome \u201cdiagnoses\u201d are no more than labels. There is an apocryphal story (at least, I hope it\u2019s apocryphal) about a consultant doing a whirlwind ward round, who on asking for the diagnosis in a particular case is told \u201cPUO\u201d (\u201cpyrexia of unknown origin\u201d). \u201cWell done,\u201d he says, and moves on to the next patient.\nConsider also the patient with delirium or dementia. The nature of the problem may be immediately clear from the way in which the patient takes part in the conversation, but it may be hard to distinguish between the two conditions, acute and chronic, and to elucidate the underlying cause and any other important features simply from what the patient says and without seeking information from others."

            "text": "There is a Proustian element in this.\nWhen in 1922 C K Scott Moncrieff began to translate Proust\u2019s epic novel \u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu, the first part of which, Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de chez Swann, had been published in 1913, he translated the title as RemembranceofThingsPast. When Terence Kilmartin revised Scott Moncrieff\u2019s version in 1981, correcting errors and relying on a 1954 French edition, he retained the title. Only in 1992, when D J Enright\u2019s further revision appeared, based on the Pl\u00e9iade edition of the French text (1987\u20139), did publishers start to use the more accurate title, In Search of Lost Time, which is now standard.\nWhen Proust wrote to Scott Moncrieff, just a month before he died on 18 November 1922, he praised the translation but averred that the translator had confused \u201cle temps perdu\u201d with \u201cle temps retrouv\u00e9\u201d (which is also the title of the last volume in the sequence).4 Scott Moncrieff\u2019s translation is a literary one. It comes from Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnet 30:\n\u201cWhen to the sessions of sweet silent thought I summon up remembrance of things past, I sigh the lack ofmany a thing I sought, And with old woes new wail my dear time\u2019s waste. \u2026\u201d\nBut Proust distinguished voluntary and involuntary memory. Remembrance of things past he considered to be an expression of the former, obtained by willful recall. The latter, often stimulated by tastes and odours, is what his protagonist Marcel experiences, for example, when the taste of Aunt L\u00e9onie\u2019s madeleine, dipped in tea or a tisane, brings past events flooding back to his mind. That is why Scott Moncrieff\u2019s translation misses the point.\nToday psychologists distinguish two types of autobiographical memory, semantic and episodic.5 \u201cSemantic\u201d comes from the Greek adjective \u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2, significant, which in turn comes from the verb \u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd to show or signify, from the noun \u03c3\u1fc6\u03bc\u03b1, a sign. Semantic memory deals with meanings and concepts and reflects the ability to recall things one knows but has not oneself experienced\u2014factual information, such as the lines in Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnet 30. Episodic memory, on the other hand, is the ability to recall specific episodes from one\u2019s own experience.\nThe hippocampus plays a role in processing episodic memory and it also contains a large number of\n1the bmj | BMJ 2022;376:o804 | doi: 10.1136/bmj.o804\nOPINION\nCentre for Evidence Based Medicine, Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford\nTwitter @JKAronson\nCite this as: BMJ 2022;376:o804\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.o804\nPublished: 25 March 2022\ncopyright. on 17 January 2024 at Indian Institute of T\nechnology P atna (IIT P atna).

It has therefore been suggested that Proust\u2019s description of involuntary recall secondary to olfactory sensations prefigures episodic memory.6 Olfactory stimulation of memory is known as the Proust phenomenon, which can also be engendered by stimulation of the amygdala.7 In neurodegenerative diseases olfactory function is markedly reduced, as is the patient\u2019s ability to generate not only voluntary but also involuntary memories.\nIn most cases the patient\u2019s tale, an effort of autobiographical memory, is a Shakespearean attempt to conjure up remembrance of things past, primarily using episodic memory. The more recent the events the more cogent the account is likely to be, but not infrequently a patient will date the onset of a condition to another memorable event, such as the death of a much loved pet, which may not accurately reflect the history. In contrast, in the case of the patient with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, and in those with other causes of hippocampal damage,8 -10 insofar as memory is possible the effort might be better regarded as largely Proustian. Indeed, olfactory stimuli may improve autobiographical recall in patients with mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease.11\nCompeting interests: None declared.\nProvenance and peer review: Not commissioned; not peer reviewed.\n1 Aronson JK.
