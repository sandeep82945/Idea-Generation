Extension to Other Fluid Systems: Investigate the three-wave two-branch interaction mechanism in different geometrical setups or fluid systems, such as cylindrical or spherical containers, to understand the universality and variability of the observed phenomena. This could involve varying the fluid properties (e.g., viscosity, surface tension) and container shapes to see how these factors influence the interaction mechanism and resonance conditions.

Numerical Simulations and Theoretical Models: Develop comprehensive numerical models that can simulate the observed three-wave interactions and compare these models with experimental results. Such models could help in understanding the underlying physics more deeply, especially the interaction coefficients and phase dynamics. Additionally, they can be used to predict the behavior in systems where experimental observations might be challenging or not feasible.

Wave Turbulence and Energy Cascade Mechanisms: Explore the transition to wave turbulence and the role of three-wave interactions in generating and sustaining a turbulent wave spectrum. This includes studying the energy cascade process in detail, understanding the conditions under which the cascade becomes continuous, and how energy is distributed across different wave modes and frequencies.

Control and Manipulation of Wave Interactions: Develop methods to control or manipulate the three-wave interactions through external interventions, such as varying the forcing frequency or amplitude, modifying the container's geometry, or introducing obstacles within the fluid. This research could lead to practical applications in wave energy conversion, mixing processes, or controlling wave-related phenomena in engineering and environmental contexts.

Analog Systems and Cross-Disciplinary Applications: Investigate the presence and implications of similar three-wave interaction mechanisms in other physical systems, such as plasma physics, optical systems, or mechanical oscillators. Exploring these analogies could unveil new insights into wave dynamics across different branches of physics and lead to cross-disciplinary applications, such as nonlinear optics, energy transfer mechanisms in plasmas, or novel approaches to vibration control in mechanical systems.
