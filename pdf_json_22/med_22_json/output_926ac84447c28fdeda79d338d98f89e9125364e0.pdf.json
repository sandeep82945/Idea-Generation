    "abstractText": "In nonreproductive cancers, males have poorer outcomes than females, with studies also demonstrating sex-based immunologic differences. However, it remains undetermined whether these observed immune differences contribute to the poorer outcomes seen in males. To investigate these sex-based alterations to antitumor immunity, Yang, Jin, and colleagues used transplant and spontaneous murine tumor models and found male tumors to be significantly more proliferative with fewer infiltrating CD8+ T cells. As previous studies have shown that CD8+ T cells in a stem-like state, rather than a terminally exhausted state, mediate tumor regression in response to immune checkpoint blockade and T-cell therapies, analysis of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells was conducted and revealed a higher proportion of stem-like T cells in females and exhausted T cells in males, with male CD8+ T cells also having higher PD-1 expression. Using adoptive transfer of CD8+ T cells as a model of T-cell therapy, male therapeutic CD8+ T cells exhibited diminished stem-like properties and enhanced exhaustion, which yielded poorer therapeutic effect. Analysis of publicly available integrated transcriptomic data showed that the androgen receptor (AR) was enriched in CD8+ T cells compared to other T-cell subsets, and functional analyses revealed that T cell\u2013intrinsic AR activity is a major contributor to sex differences, with AR deficiency enhancing effector cytokine and Granzyme B production as well as increasing the stem cell\u2013like CD8+ T-cell population. Moreover, genetic ablation of AR pushed the epigenetic landscape of tumorinfiltrating male CD8+ T cells toward a more female-like state, while castration of male mice prevented AR-mediated suppression of antitumor T-cell activity and was found to be synergistic with anti\u2013PD-L1 treatment. Additionally, analysis of patient data also revealed the existence of this positive correlation between AR expression and CD8+ T-cell exhaustion. In summary, this study shows that sex-based differences in nonreproductive cancers are due to CD8+ T cell\u2013intrinsic AR signaling that leads to a terminally exhausted differentiation program and suggests that AR signaling inhibition could improve cancer immunotherapy response. \u25a0",

            "text": "Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a common feature of human cancer, and resulting chromosomal abnormalities can introduce double-stranded DNA into the cytosol and activate cGAS\u2013STING-mediated inflammatory signaling. Although this axis can promote apoptosis and immunosurveillance, CGAS and STING are rarely mutated in cancer. To study this inflammatory response in the context of CIN, Hong and colleagues induced acute or chronic CIN in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells via pharmacologic inhibition of the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint or ectopic expression of a dominant-negative mutant form of a microtubule depolymerase, respectively. Whereas CIN activated cGAS\u2013STING signaling, CRISPR\u2013Cas9-mediated CGAS knockout in the context of CIN led to decreased cell viability in vitro and reduced tumor growth in vivo, suggesting that the cGAS\u2013STING pathway promotes survival of cancer cells undergoing CIN. Functional genetic studies demonstrated that STAT3 activation was important for cell survival downstream of cGAS, as STAT3 knockout similarly sensitized TNBC cells following CIN induction. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a cGAS-dependent, CINinduced increase in expression of the inflammatory cytokine IL6, a known activator of STAT3. In agreement with a model in which IL6 signaling promotes survival via STAT3, increasing doses of recombinant IL6 rescued cell viability following CIN induction in CGAS knockout TNBC cells, while inhibition of the IL6 receptor, via the blocking antibody tocilizumab, sensitized TNBC cells experiencing CIN. In multiple murine models, tocilizumab extended tumor-free survival and delayed progression in mice bearing CIN-high tumors. Notably, classification of breast cancer samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas based on CIN and IL6\u2013STAT3 activity revealed that tumors with both high CIN and IL6 signaling had decreased overall survival. Moreover, these observations extended beyond breast cancer, as IL6 signaling was not only necessary for viability after induction of CIN in multiple cancer lineages but also predictive of decreased survival in patients with various tumor types. In summary, this study demonstrates the importance of cGAS\u2013STINGmediated inflammatory signaling in enabling cancer cells to survive despite CIN. \u25a0 Hong C, Schubert M, Tijhuis AE, Requesens M, Roorda M, van den Brink A, et al. cGAS\u2013STING drives the IL-6-dependent survival of chromosomally instable cancers.
