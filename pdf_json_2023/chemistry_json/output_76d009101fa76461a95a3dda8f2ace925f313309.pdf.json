    "abstractText": "The low bioavailability of orally administered drugs as a result of the instability in the gastrointestinal tract environment creates significant challenges to developing site-targeted drug delivery systems. This study proposes a novel hydrogel drug carrier using pH-responsive materials assisted with semi-solid extrusion 3D printing technology, enabling site-targeted drug release and customisation of temporal release profiles. The effects of material parameters on the pH-responsive behaviours of printed tablets were analysed thoroughly by investigating the swelling properties under both artificial gastric and intestinal fluids. It has been shown that high swelling rates at either acidic or alkaline conditions can be achieved by adjusting the mass ratio between sodium alginate and carboxymethyl chitosan, enabling site-targeted release. The drug release experiments reveal that gastric drug release can be achieved with a mass ratio of 1:3, whilst a ratio of 3:1 allows for intestinal release. Furthermore, controlled release is realised by tuning the infill density of the printing process. The method proposed in this study can not only significantly improve the bioavailability of oral drugs, but also offer the potential that each component of a compound drug tablet can be released in a controlled manner at a target location.",

            "text": "Oral compounded tablet delivery is popular among various drug delivery systems because of its ease of administration and low patient pain [1]; it has also been adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a strategy for improving patient compliance [2,3]. Patients with multiple underlying conditions (suffering from peptic ulcers, diabetes, and chronic diseases simultaneously, for instance) require multiple medications with sustained effects at different sites to reduce side effects and improve the efficiency of drugs. Therapeutic drugs are needed for sustained and controlled release in the stomach for gastric disorders such as peptic ulcers, while antineoplastic therapies for systemic diseases such as diabetes and chronic diseases usually require a high absorption of proteins and peptides in the intestine. Oral proteins and peptides can be broken by gastric juice while passing through the stomach due to the pH gradient in the gastrointestinal tract of humans, resulting in the low bioavailability of intestinal drugs [4]. Therefore, achieving the location-targeted release of compound drugs through the oral routine can improve the bioavailability of drugs. pH-responsive release strategies assisted with 3D printing technology have been widely used for addressing the problems above. Of the many 3D printable biomaterials, pH-responsive hydrogels are preferred due to their high volume response to environmental pH changes. They can be utilised to regulate drug release at a specific location within human bodies. Sodium alginate (SA), one of the most widely used natural anionic biopolymers, is sensitive to pH values [5,6]. It can crosslink with divalent cations such as Ca2+, Ba2+, or Zn2+ to form three-dimensional networks [7\u20139]. A large number of carboxyl groups in SA\nBioengineering 2023, 10, 402. https://doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering10040402 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/bioengineering\nBioengineering 2023, 10, 402 2 of 15\nhydrogels can become ionised under acidic conditions, leading to the shrinkage of structure that can impede the release of the loaded drug. In contrast, deprotonation occurring under alkaline conditions can expand the networks, thereby accelerating drug release [10]. Nonetheless, SA hydrogels possess weak mechanical properties and high degradation rates, leading to abrupt release [6,11]. It has been shown that such disadvantages of SA can be overcome by mixing amphoteric polyelectrolyte water-soluble carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) with SA [12,13]. Chitosan hydrogels containing SA have been widely adopted for sustained drug delivery in the stomach because of their high pH response under acidic conditions [14\u201318]. However, it is still challenging to develop a single pH-responsive drug delivery system that can be used for regulating both gastric and intestinal drug release. 3D printing technology is adopted broadly to fabricate personalised drug delivery systems due to its geometrical flexibility and multi-material printing feature, enabling drugs to be delivered over tailored release profiles [19\u201321]. Semi-solid extrusion (SSE), a material extrusion 3D printing method, has been adopted for manufacturing personalised drug delivery systems due to its low printing temperature and high drug loading capacity [22]; however, the printability of the material remains an issue, and high printing accuracy is challenging to be achieved [23]. Falcon et al. [23] improved the hydrogel printing performance by pre-crosslinking calcium ions in hydrogels. Wei et al. [24] used a mild semi-solid paste extrusion 3D printing technique to fabricate oral tablets with two different release kinetics using caffeine and vitamin B analogues as model drugs; however, the printed tablets undergo poly-stack shrinkage after drying, leading to low printing fidelity. The rheological properties of the semi-solids can also affect the printing accuracy and the geometry of the printed parts. Therefore, a new formula for drug release systems offering predominant printability and tunable release behaviours is urgently required. In this study, pH-responsive tablets were fabricated using a new printing ink containing CMCS, SA, polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), diphenyl(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide (TPO), and drugs. PEGDA, a pharmaceutical photocurable polymer, can be cured under UV light irradiation after the addition of photoinitiators TPO to improve the forming ability of semi-solid extrusion 3D printing. After light curing, the tablets were then crosslinked secondary with Ca2+ to enable the responsive capability to pH values. The impact of material parameters on pH-responsive behaviours was then thoroughly analysed. It has been found that location-dependent drug release can be achieved by adjusting the ratio between SA and CMCS, allowing for independent drug releases in the stomach or intestine. Furthermore, the rheological analysis of the printing ink was carried out, demonstrating strong shear-thinning behaviours and good recovery capability. Finally, controlled/sustained release was achieved by tuning the release profiles regulated by the infill density of different printing layers."

            "heading": "3.1. Effects of Calcium ion Concentration and Crosslinking Time on pH-Responsive Properties",
            "text": "The printed tablets were post-treated with calcium ions to allow for secondary crosslinking so as to endow them with pH-responsive properties. The effects of calcium ion concentration on pH-responsive behaviours were investigated by crosslinking the hydrogels with 1%, 2%, 5%, or 10% of calcium ions. To minimise the impact from other parameters, the ratio between SA and CMCS was chosen to be 2:1 and the crosslinking time was kept constant (1h). Since the drug release properties of hydrogels depend on their swelling behaviours [30], studying the swelling behaviour of hydrogels appears to be crucial for controlled drug release [31]. As shown in Figure 2a, the hydrogel\u2019s swelling rate decreased rapidly with the increase of CaCl2 (particularly for pH 7.4), demonstrating a significant correlation with the concentration of calcium ions. The swelling rate was reduced by approximately 11 times for pH 7.4 when increasing the concentration of CaCl2 from 1% to 10%, whereas it was ~3x for pH 1.2. Interestingly, when the concentration of CaCl2 was greater than ~5%, the swelling rate of the hydrogel at pH 7.4 was less than that of pH 1.2. This may be attributed to the excessive chelation between calcium ions and CMCS under an acidic condition, which can form new crosslinked networks, and therefore, enhance the swelling [32].

The swelling rate at pH 1.2 increased slightly by adding CMCS or PEGDA, whereas it decreased more rapidly under pH 7.4.

The amino groups of CMCS that can be protonated enhance the swelling of the hydrogel network, leading to a higher swelling rate under acidic conditions. At pH 7.4, when a small portion of CMCS was added, the swelling rate of the hydrogel decreased. However, as the amount of CMCS increased, the hydrogel\u2019s swelling rate gradually increased.

Rheological Properties In semi-solid extrusion 3D printing, the rheological properties of the printing ink can significantly influence the printing process and the formation of the structure [35,36]. The hydrogel ink in the syringe is initially in a flow-free state (0 shear rates). Subsequently, the plunger exerts a force on the hydrogel to provide a higher shear rate, extruding the ink from the nozzle onto the printing platform. The hydrogel eventually forms a predesigned shape and returns to its flow-free state. The key rheological properties associated with the printing process include viscosity, viscoelastic shear modulus, viscosity recovery behaviour, and shear stress [37]. As shown in Figure 9a, the viscosity of the hydrogel decreased rapidly when the shear stress was promoted from 0 to 800 Pa, demonstrating strong shear-thinning behaviour. As depicted in Figure 9b, the viscosity was lowered remarkably at a light exposure time of 120 s and rebounded by approximately two-thirds at 180 s, exhibiting excellent recovery capability. According to Figure 9c, both the energy storage modulus (G\u201d) increased more rapidly with the increase of light exposure time than the loss modulus (G\u2019), leading to the rapid descending of tan\u03b4 (see Figure 9d).

In this study, tablets with three different infill densities (50%, 75%, and 100%) were manufactured using the semi-solid extrusion 3D printing method. As shown in Figure 11, the BSA release rate increased with the reduction of infill density, which is consistent with the results reported among other studies [41,42]. The release fraction was amplified by ~1.8x at 10 h when the infill density dropped from 100% to 50%. Bioengineering 2023, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 16\nFigure 11. Drug release profiles of the tablets printed with various infill densities.\n4. Conclusions This study presents an innovative drug delivery system that can modulate the release location and rate of drugs by combining semi-solid extrusion 3D printing technology with pH-responsive materials. A new printing ink consisting of CMCS, SA, PEGDA, TPO, and drugs was developed to fabricate 3D drug delivery systems, and the pH-responsive capability was enabled through secondary crosslinking with Ca2+. The pH-responsive behaviours of the printed tablets were then studied experimentally by investigating the impact of material parameters on swelling, exhibiting strong sensitivity to the concentration of Ca2+ and PEGDA, the mass ratio between SA and CMCS, and secondary crosslinking time. Distinct discrepancies in swelling at different pH values can be obtained by tuning the materials mentioned above, allowing site-targeted drug release, and optimal parameters (2% Ca2+, 5% PEGDA, and 30 min secondary crosslinking time) were also found. Additionally, specific release profiles can be achieved by adjusting the infill density of the printing, enabling controlled or sustained drug release. The method proposed in this study can not only significantly improve the bioavailability of oral drugs, patient compliance and therapeutic efficiency, but also offer the potential that each component of a compound drug tablet can be released in a controlled manner at a target location.\nAuthor Contributions: The research idea was conceptualised by F.W., L.L., F.C. and X.H.; the validation and formal analysis were conducted by F.W., L.L. and X.Z.; the original manuscript was drafted by F.W., L.L. and X.Z.; supervision, funding acquisition, and resources were provided by F.C. and X.H.; and the manuscript was edited by F.C., X.H. and F.W.; All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\nFunding: The authors acknowledge the financial support received from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52075158), the National Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province\nFigure 11.
