In this study, we exploit the fact that all aggregated curves have an intrinsic hierarchical structure, and thus hierarchical reconciliation methods can be used to improve the forecast accuracy. We provide an in-depth theory on how aggregated curves can be constructed or deconstructed, and conclude that these methods are equivalent under weak assumptions. We consider multiple reconciliation methods for aggregated curves, including previously established bottom-up, top-down, and linear optimal reconciliation approaches. We also present a new benchmark reconciliation method called \u2019aggregated-down\u2019 with similar complexity to bottom-up and top-down approaches, but it tends to provide better accuracy in this setup. We conducted an empirical forecasting study on the German day-ahead power auction market by predicting the demand and supply curves, where their equilibrium determines the electricity price for the next day. Our results demonstrate that hierarchical reconciliation methods can be used to improve the forecasting accuracy of aggregated curves.",

            "text": "Curves are frequently encountered structures in various scientific disciplines, and especially in economics and finance. Prominent examples are supply and demand curves [Marshall, 2009, Mankiw, 2014, Pindyck et al., 1995]. Other well-known examples are forwards and futures price curves [Hull, 2003], yield curves [Gu\u0308rkaynak et al., 2007], Engel curves [Aitchison and Brown, 1954, Banks et al., 1997], Philips curve [Phillips, 1958], and various types of cost curves [Pindyck et al., 1995, Eiteman and Guthrie, 1952]. The accurate estimation of these curves is important because other measures such as equilibrium values can be derived from them, and modeling a curve as a whole has the benefit of preserving additional information such as its shape or slope, which could be very useful in deriving the strategies of market participants, equilibrium values, or probabilistic forecasts, rather than modeling the equilibrium prices directly [Ziel and Steinert, 2016].\nIt is important to note that we refer to curves as a single observation at a point in time, as is the case in functional data analysis (FDA) [Shang and Hyndman, 2017, Hyndman and Ullah, 2007, Shang and Hyndman, 2011]. In this study, we consider finite-dimensional representations of curves given by a finite grid of x-values and their corresponding y-values, often referred to as f(x). Every curve with well-defined increments can be readily aggregated or disaggregated into marginal and cumulative values. For example, Figure 1 shows a simulated curve and its corresponding marginal values at each step. The cumulative values can be obtained from the marginal values by cumulatively summing them up, and the marginal values can be obtained from the cumulative values by discrete differentiation. Hence, from a computational point of view, a curve is simply a vector of aggregated values. This inherent structure of aggregated curves can be interpreted as a hierarchy, and thus hierarchical time series theory can be applied to potentially improve the forecasting accuracy [Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2018].\nAn hierarchical time series is a set of time series that naturally relate to each other, i.e. sum up or break down, according to a certain logic [Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2018, Wickramasuriya et al., 2019, Spiliotis et al., 2021]. This property is referred to as coherency and it is generally not given for individual forecasts. Approaches that allow independently forecasted time series at certain or all levels of the hierarchy to be made coherent are referred to as reconciliation methods.\nNotable advances have been recently made in optimal reconciliation approaches as well\nas in improving classic approaches, such as top-down and bottom-up approaches, in terms of their forecasting accuracy Hyndman and Athanasopoulos [2018]. Most notable is the optimal minimum trace reconciling method Wickramasuriya et al. [2019]. Other methods have also been proposed, such as a game-theoretically optimal reconciliation approach [Van Erven and Cugliari, 2015], averaging approaches called level conditional coherent (LCC) and combined conditional coherent (CCC) point forecasts [Di Fonzo and Girolimetto, 2021, Hollyman et al., 2021] and machine-learning based reconciliation [Spiliotis et al., 2021], [Bre\u0301ge\u0300re and Huard, 2022], [Huard et al., 2020].\nIn this study, we introduce four novel features into the field of hierarchical forecasting. First, we exploit the fact that all aggregated curves have an implicit hierarchical structure and that reconciliation approaches can be used to potentially improve their forecast accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first time that aggregated curves have been treated as hierarchical structures. We consider various methods of constructing and deconstruction the curves, including different representations of aggregated curves. Second, we introduce a new, simple reconciliation approach called aggregated-down with similar complexity to the top-down approach, which we recommend using as a benchmark method\nalongside bottom-up and top-down approaches. Third, we study minimum trace optimal reconciliation approaches for aggregated curves in detail. In particular, we provide a result to show that under some assumptions, the reconciliation approach is independent of the representation of the curve. Finally, we applied all of these approaches in an empirical setting to forecast the supply and demand curves for day-ahead electricity price auctions. We conclude that forecast accuracy can be improved through hierarchical reconciliation.\nTo assess the effect of hierarchical reconciliation approaches on aggregated curves in an empirical setting we consider an application to the German day-ahead electricity markets. In this auction-based market, submitted bids are aggregated to form supply and demand curves [Narajewski and Ziel, 2022]. The intersection of the curves yields the day-ahead electricity price. Hence, the market mechanism itself fits our idea of aggregated curves, and thus the application of hierarchical forecasting is a natural extension.\nZiel and Steinert [2016, 2018], Haben et al. [2021a] forecast the day-ahead electricity price by forecasting the corresponding bids, aggregating them to form supply and demand curves, and computing the resulting intersection of these curves to yield the final price forecasts. This implicit application of the simple bottom-up reconciliation approach improved both point and probabilistic price forecasts. Recent related papers Kulakov [2020], Mestre et al. [2020], Soloviova and Vargiolu [2021] which forecast electricity supply and demand curves show similar findings.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the notation for the inherent hierarchical structure of aggregated curves. We also describe different ways to construct and represent curves via aggregation and/or disaggregation. In Section 3, we present the reconciliation approaches that we consider in this study, including the new aggregated-down approach and their simplified formulas according to the specific hierarchical structure of aggregated curves. Furthermore, we show that under some assumptions, the reconciliation approach is independent of the previously introduced curve representations. In Section 4, we present a simulation study of the new aggregated-down approach where we analyze and compare with the other reconciliation methods considered in this study. In Section 5, we introduce the market clearing mechanism for the German day-ahead electricity market and the model used to forecast the day-ahead supply and demand curves. We also present our empirical study, the data used, and the empirical results. We summarize the results and provide our conclusions in Section 6."

The curve can be obtained from an aggregation procedure with the marginals. Alternatively, we can start with the curve and describe a disaggregation relationship to obtain the bottom values.\nHowever, a natural method of representation that we refer to as the canonical structure of an aggregated curve is shown in Figure 2. At the end of this section, we also discuss other representations."

            "heading": "2.1 Canonical representation",
            "text": "The canonical representation of an aggregated curve at we illustrate in Figure 2 is regarded as the standard representation. This representation also appears naturally when modeling auction curves in economics [Ziel and Steinert, 2016]. It can be obtained by considering the bottom values together with an aggregation procedure to receive the aggregated values, but also the other way around.\nBased on the first approach above, we introduce the following notation. Let b = (b1, . . . , bn) \u2032 be the n-dimensional vector of bottom-level or marginal values with n > 1,\nas shown in Figure 2. Now, we introduce their aggregation by the vector a = (a1, . . . , an) \u2032, which is an n-dimensional vector of aggregated or cumulative values starting from the top level, where ai for i \u2208 {1, . . . , n} represents the curve at point i. Formally, this is defined as\nai = i\u2211\nj=1\nbj , (1)\ni.e. the cumulative sum of b. In addition, the recursive relationship holds\nai = ai\u22121 + bi for 1 \u2264 i < n and a1 = b1. (2)\nWe note that Equation (2) is simply the mathematical representation of Figure 2. The top level an is the most aggregated level.\nAlternatively, we can introduce the canonical representation starting from the aggregated values a. Then, we can obtain the bottom values b by disaggregation or differencing with an initial value for b1:\nbi = ai \u2212 ai\u22121, for 1 < i \u2264 n and b1 = a1. (3)\nFurthermore, we can express b as b = Da where D is an invertible n-dimensional quadratic matrix defined as\nDn =  1 0 . . . 0 0 \u22121 1 . . . 0 0 ... ... . . . ... ...\n0 0 . . . \u22121 1\n . (4)\nConsequently, the matrix representation of equation (1) is a = D\u22121n b where D \u22121 n is a lowerleft triangular matrix with ones on the diagonal and lower triangle. s Using the definitions of aggregated values a and bottom-level values b we can compactly write all of the values shown in Figure (2) as the (2n\u2212 1)-dimensional vector\ny =  an ... a2\nb\n (5)\nwhich contains the values of a in inverse order except for its first value a1, which matches b1. Thus, (y1, . . . , yn) \u2032 may be regarded as aggregated values and (yn, . . . , y2n\u22121) \u2032 as bottomlevel values.\nThe aggregation relationship within y can be represented using the (2n \u2212 1) \u00d7 ndimensional summation matrix S, which describes the hierarchical structure of the considered data such that y = Sb holds. For the considered canonical representation we have\nS =  1n\u22121 Un\u22121 In  =  1 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 1 1 1 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 1 0 ... ... . . . ... ... 1 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 1 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 ... ... . . . ... ... 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 1 0\n0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 1\n , (6)\nwhere Un\u22121 is a unit anti-diagonal upper-left triangular matrix of dimension (n \u2212 1) and In is an identity matrix of dimension n.\nOther situations can be considered where even more parts of the hierarchical curve are available. Using the notation bi:j = \u2211j\nl=i bl the canonical setting uses b1:j for j > 1\nfor the aggregated values, i.e. a = (b1:1, b1:2, . . . , b1:n) \u2032. We could also consider a setting where, e.g. b2:3 = b2 + b3, is also available, which would enrich the hierarchical structure with this additional information. However, the resulting structures that include general bi:j combinations could include up to n(n \u2212 1)/2 values in the corresponding y vector. This would increase computational costs substantially, so we only study the specific structure where forecasts y\u0302 (or equivalently a\u0302 and b\u0302) are available to the forecaster."

            "text": "In this subsection, we discuss representations other than the canonical one for aggregated curves. We generalize the representation scheme so the canonical representation is embedded. In particular, we consider a situation where the aggregated values a are given and the scope involves defining a disaggregation rule to receive the bottom values b.\nWe introduce k as the element of a where from we start the disaggregation rule. In the canonical representation we disaggregate a starting from the first value k = 1 of the curve, i.e. for k = 1 it holds that bk = ak, bi = ai \u2212 ai\u22121 for i > k (see Equation (3)). This starting point of aggregation/disaggregation k could be changed to achieve an alternative\nbottom-values vector b[k]. Clearly, b = b[1] and if we start disaggregating from the end, i.e. k = n, we obtain b[n],1 = an, b[n],2 = an\u22121 \u2212 an, and in general, b[n],i = an\u2212i+1 \u2212 an\u2212i+2. Thus, b[n],i has the opposite sign to bi for i < n. However, this approach can be embedded in the canonical representation, which we receive by defining bi = b[n],n\u2212i+1. Thus, the theory of canonical representations can also be applied.\nIf we consider the disaggregation procedure with an initial value at k where 1 < k < n with the corresponding value b[k],k = ak, then we obtain a representation that is substantially different from the b[1] and b[n] situations. The reason for this difference is that we require two directions of aggregation, with one for bottom values larger than k and the other one for smaller values. Thus, we have\nb[k],i =  ai \u2212 ai\u22121 , if i > k ai \u2212 ai+1 , if i < k\nai , if i = k\n(7)\nWe observe that the special cases of b[1] (the canonical representation) and b[n] can be defined using the definition (7). For illustrative purposes and to easier understand, we provide an n = 6-dimensional example for k = 1, 3, 6 in Table 1.\nIn the general b[k] setting, the summation matrix S[k] is given by\nS[k] =  On\u2212k,k\u22121 1n\u2212k Un\u2212k Lk\u22121 1k\u22121 Ok\u22121,n\u2212k\nIn  (8) where Lk\u22121 is a (k\u22121)-dimensional matrix that contains 1 on the lower anti-diagonal. The general summation matrix S[k] in (8) also nests the canonical case S in (6) for k = 1. The\nvector y[k] in the corresponding hierarchy that satisfies y[k] = S[k]b is\ny[k] = a[\u2212k] b[k]  (9) where we define a[\u2212k] as the reversed vector a without the kth element, i.e. a[\u2212k] = (an, . . . , ak+1, ak\u22121, . . . , a1) \u2032. Clearly, for k = 1 we have y = y[k] (see definition (9)).\nHowever, the different representations of the hierarchical structure are actually only formal representations and do not automatically provide different reconciled forecasts by themselves, as shown at the end of the next section. To show that this is the case, we observe that the following relations hold:\nai =  \u2211i\nj=k b[k],j , if i > k\u2211k j=i b[k],j , if i \u2264 k\n(10)\nand\nbi =  a1 , if i = 1 \u2212b[k],i\u22121 , if 1 < i < k + 1\nb[k],i , if i \u2265 k + 1.\n(11)\nThese relations help us define Equation (7) in matrix form as b[k] = A[k]a with matrix A[k], which yields y[k] = S[k]A[k]a. For k = 1, we have A[k] = Dn from Equation (4). A[k] has the form:\nA[k] =  Ik\u22121 + 0k\u22122+1 \u2212Ik\u22122 0 0\u2032k\u22122+1  0k\u22122 \u22121  Ok\u22121,n\u2212k 0\u2032k\u22121 1 0 \u2032 n\u2212k\nOn\u2212k,k\u22121\n \u22121 0n\u2212k\u22121  In\u2212k +  0n\u2212k\u22121 0 \u2212In\u2212k\u22121 0\u2032n\u2212k\u22121 \n . (12)\nIn addition, according to definition (9), a matrix B[k] exists that satisfies y = B[k]y[k].\nWe note that B[k] has the structure\nB[k] = \nIn\u2212k On\u2212k,k\u22121 On\u2212k,k\u22121 0n\u2212k On\u2212k,n\u2212k 0\u2032n\u2212k 0 \u2032 k\u22121 0 \u2032 k\u22121 1 0 \u2032 n\u2212k Ok\u22121,n\u2212k Ik\u22121 Ok\u22121,k\u22121 0k\u22121 Ok\u22121,n\u2212k Ok\u22121,n\u2212k Ok\u22121,k\u22121 \u2212Ik\u22121 0k\u22121 Ok\u22121,n\u2212k On\u2212k,n\u2212k On\u2212k,k\u22121 On\u2212k,k\u22121 0n\u2212k In\u2212k  . (13)\nFurthermore, it is easy to check thatB[k] is orthogonal, i.e. it holdsB \u22121 [k] = B \u2032 [k]. We observe that B[k] is a generalized permutation matrix that contains permutations and reflection components.\nFinally, using y = B[k]y[k], y[k] = S[k]A[k]a and a = D \u22121 n b we obtain that y =\nB[k]S[k]A[k]D \u22121 n b. Thus, it holds that S = B[k]S[k]A[k]D \u22121 n for all k, which is valuable for further analysis."

Equation (16) is the result obtained by minimizing the variance of the coherent forecasts. W is not known and must be estimated. We consider multiple estimators for W , which are listed below. The first five estimators were proposed by Hyndman and Athanasopoulos [2018] and Wickramasuriya et al. [2019].\n1. Wopols = I2n\u22121, where I2n\u22121 is the identity matrix. For the optimal projection matrix\nP in the aggregated curves setting, we have Popols = (S \u2032S)\u22121S\u2032 . We note that S\u2032S is of full rank and invertible because it holds\nS\u2032S = [1n\u22121 : Un\u22121] \u2032[1n\u22121 : Un\u22121] + In =  n n\u2212 1 n\u2212 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 2 1 n\u2212 1 n n\u2212 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 2 1 n\u2212 2 n\u2212 2 n\u2212 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 2 1 ... ... ... . . . ... ... 2 2 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 3 1\n1 1 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 1 2\n .\nThus, we obtain Popols = ([1n\u22121 : Un\u22121] \u2032[1n\u22121 : Un\u22121] + In) \u22121 S\u2032. However, the assumption that Var[y \u2212 y\u0302] is constant is usually not realistic in an aggregated curve setting because we expect a tendency towards larger variances for higher aggregation levels. We use opols as an abbreviation for this approach.\n2. Woplambda = \u039b, \u039b = Diag(S1n), where S is the summation matrix and 1n is a unit\nvector of the same dimension as the number of bottom-level time series. In our aggregated curves setting, it holds that Diag(\u039b) = S1n = (n, n \u2212 1, . . . , 2, 1, 1, . . . , 1)\u2032, which means that the higher aggregated values of the curves are weighted less, proportional to their level of aggregation starting from 1 as the lowest and n as the top. This corresponds to a setting where all bottom-level forecasts b have the same variance and are uncorrelated. We use oplambda as an abbreviation for this approach.\n3. Wopwls = W\u0302dcov, where W\u0302dcov is an estimator for Wdcov = Diag(Wcov) with Wcov\nas the covariance matrix of the errors associated with y.

The Wopwls approach may be regarded as a generalization of the Woplambda approach. This design corresponds to a setting where the individual forecast errors have different variances but are uncorrelated. We use opwls as an abbreviation for this approach.\n4. Wopcov = W\u0302cov, where Wcov is the full sample covariance matrix of the error terms.\nThe underlying setting corresponds to a situation where the forecast errors have varying variances and exhibit linear dependence. We use opcov as an abbreviation for this approach.\n5.

We left out the results for the average ratio and ratio of averages approaches for top-down and aggregateddown since they were always greatly inferior to those obtained using the base case. We also omit some optimal methods for brevity because these tended to produce very similar results.\nThe key finding from this simulation study is that the aggregated-down approach using forecasted values was very similar to the other methods, and even optimal ones. By contrast, the top-down approach using forecasted values was markedly inferior in the setups considered. As expected, the accuracy generally decreases as more bottom-levels (n) were added. However, this was disproportionally the case with the top-down approach, which was caused by extreme sensitivity to outliers because the proportions were multiplicatively connected and common factors were present across the hierarchy. We refer to this issue as the error inheritance of proportions.\nThis situation is clear when we consider the formulas. For illustrative purposes, we\nconsider the simplest proportions p\u0302fo,n, and p\u0302fo,n\u22121:\np\u0302fo,n = b\u0302n\na\u0302n\u22121 + b\u0302n , p\u0302fo,n\u22121 =\nb\u0302n\u22121\na\u0302n\u22122 + b\u0302n\u22121\na\u0302n\u22121\na\u0302n\u22121 + b\u0302n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 =1\u2212p\u0302fo,n\nClearly, the formulas are sensitive to outliers when the denominator a\u0302n\u22121+ b\u0302n is very small, i.e. when a\u0302n\u22121 \u2248 \u2212b\u0302n. If this is the case, then all of the subsequent proportions will generally be outliers because p\u0302fo,n is part of p\u0302fo,n\u22121, and so on. It should be noted that this occurs if we allow negative values. If we only consider monotonously increasing curves, then these outliers do not occur, as shown in Table 6, where we simulated a strictly positive AR(1) process leading to errors close to the other methods. To understand the sensitivity to outliers, Table 7 shows the results for the same setup with all outliers defined as |p\u0302fo,1| > 50 removed. The errors improved for greatly tdfo, especially with increasing values of N .\nThis issue is essentially error aggregation and is important considering the specific hierarchical structure of aggregated curves because the hierarchy considered is completely vertical and each additional point on the curve deepens the hierarchy instead of widening it. Thus, if we allow for negative values, the outliers become larger for tdfo when the hierarchy is deeper. The aggregated-down approach is not sensitive to this distance issue since proportions are not multiplicative, but instead they are always calculated using values immediately above the hierarchy level considered, and non-monotonic curves can be easily accommodated. The other simulation setups yielded similar results, as shown in Appendix Tables 8, 9, 10, and 11.\nIt is important to note that we consider the aggregated-down approach as a simple benchmark approach. It is not equivalent to more sophisticated optimal reconciliation\nmethods. Nevertheless, aggregated-down has the advantages of being intuitive and using very simple formulas for calculating proportion, especially compared to the top-down approaches, and is programmatically simple as well as efficient. Furthermore, it is not affected by the error aggregating issue, unlike the top-down approach."

These bids are the volumes that buyers are willing to buy and that producers are willing to sell at certain prices. For the time range of data considered, bid volumes can be specified for prices ranging from -500 EUR/MWh up to 3000 EUR/MWh with an increment of 0.1 EUR/MWh1. After gate closure, the volumes bid across all participating countries are aggregated and unique prices and volumes are generated for each separate market area. One of these areas is Germany-Luxembourg, which we modeled and forecasted in this study. The market clearing results as well as the 24 supply and demand curves are published shortly after gate closure at 12:00 CET. All major relevant aspects of the German day-ahead electricity market are illustrated in Figure 3 (see Petropoulos et al. [2022] for more details). Only selected prices can be bid on out of a total of 35001 possible prices, so the curves have a characteristic step-like appearance due to the many zero-volume prices, i.e. prices that were not bid on Ziel and Steinert [2016].\nFigure 4 shows the German volumes bid for each price for a selected day and hour. In total, there are 35001 prices that can be bid on for each hour, where most usually have a volume of zero, as can be observed by the many empty intervals between the bars . Certain prices are generally preferred by market participants, such as multiples of 10 and those in the vicinity of 40 EUR/MWh, as shown by the clusters formed around these prices in Figure 4.

The electricity prices are not modeled directly but instead they are obtained from the forecasts of the whole day-ahead curves as their intersection.\n[Ziel and Steinert, 2016, 2018, Haben et al., 2021a, Kulakov, 2020] modeled the dayahead supply and demand curves by grouping the prices into price classes, thus drastically reducing the dimensionality, e.g., from 350001 prices to a few price classes (40 in our study), to make the problem computationally feasible. The prices are split into price classes by inverting the supply and demand curves at a pre-specified grid of equidistant volumes [Ziel and Steinert, 2016]. The result is shown in Figure 5, where the curves are approximated by ca. 20 points each. This form of dimensionality reduction via binning can\nbe interpreted as a special case of applying FDA where the basis functions are constants, i.e. dummy variables, that do not overlap. This works very well in our case because the original curves are not smooth. An additional advantage is computability because it would be quite costly to smoothen the curves first, model them, and then un-smooth them again for the final representation. [Ziel and Steinert, 2016] use a simple but very effective\nmethod for reconstructing the forecasted curves from the price class approximations, i.e., by using historical proportions for each price. This method was shown to capture the shape of the original curves very well without requiring vast computational resources. However, this reconstruction step is only important for calculating the price as the intersection of the supply and demand curves and does not affect the forecasting accuracy of the curves themselves, hence we refer to the original X-model paper for more information [Ziel and Steinert, 2016] as well as other papers that use more classical FDA approaches to implement the X-model [Soloviova and Vargiolu, 2021, Soloviova].\nThus, the response variable is the sum of the volume within a price class, which is modeled separately for every hour and class. For 40 price classes comprising both supply and demand, a total of 40 \u00d7 24 regressions must be conducted to forecast curves for all hours in the next day. [Ziel and Steinert, 2016] modeled each price class volume marginally, and thus the supply and demand curves were generated by cumulatively summing up the forecasted values, which is equivalent to forecasting only the bottom-level values and using the bottom-up reconciliation approach described earlier. In this study, we modeled both the marginal and cumulative responses, and used them to compare and contrast the different\nreconciliation approaches. It should be noted that the method using marginal values will always be equivalent to the bottom-up approach.\nTo model the responses, we used a combination of autoregressive and external regressors.\nLet then X (c) S,d,h and X (c) D,d,h be the supply and demand volumes at day d and hour h of price class c among the price classes generated for the supply and demand curves, respectively. These constitute the bulk of the regressor matrix because each price class volume will depend on its lags according to a specific lag structure. The external regressors are denoted by X (1) X,d,h, . . . , X (MX) X,d,h for a total ofMX external regressors, and they comprise the prices for coal, gas, oil and CO2 emissions (EUAs), the day-ahead prices and volumes on the previous day, as well as the day-ahead forecasts for the country-wide load, solar, onshore wind, and offshore wind production. The day-ahead data were taken from www.epexspot.com and the forecasts from www.entsoe.eu.\nLet MS and MD be the number of price classes for the supply and demand curves,\nrespectively. Then. all regressors can be compactly written as\nXd,h = (X1,d,h, . . . , XM,d,h) \u2032 = (( X (c\u2208CS) S,d,h ) , ( X (c\u2208CD) D,d,h ) , ( X (c\u2208CX) X,d,h ))\u2032 ,\nwhere CS and CD are the sets of price classes for the supply and demand sides, respectively, CX is the set of external regressors CX = { X (1) X,d,h1, . . . , X (MX) X,d,h } , andM =MS+MD+MX .\nTo capture the weekly seasonality, we also included dummy regressors for every day of the week which we denoted by a function Wk(d) that returns the day of the week d. The full model can be written as\nXm,d,h = M\u2211 k=1 24\u2211 j=1 \u2211 k\u2208Im,h(l,j) \u03d5m,h,l,j,kXl,d\u2212k,j + 7\u2211 k=2 \u03c8m,h,kWk(d) + \u03b5m,d,h,\nfor m \u2208 {1, . . . ,MS +MD} and Im,h(l, j) represents the sets of possible lags, which we\ndefined as\nIm,h(l, j) =  {1, . . . , 30}, for m = l and h = j {1, . . . , 8}, for (m = l and h \u0338= j) or (m \u0338= l and h = j)\n{1}, for m \u0338= l and h \u0338= j\n.\nWe fitted the models using lasso [Ziel and Steinert, 2016] as implemented in the glmnet R package."

            "text": "We conducted a day-ahead rolling window forecasting study for each day between 2019- 01-01 and 2019-06-30. We used a rolling window length of 730 = 2 \u00d7 365 days to forecast each day. The price classes were generated only once for the first day-ahead forecast, i.e. using the 2017 and 2018 data, and they were kept constant throughout the study. All data were hourly except for coal, gas, oil, and EUA prices, which were daily. We used marginal values as regressors to forecast the marginal values b\u0302i and cumulative values as regressors to forecast the cumulative values a\u0302i. We chose a\u0302n \u2190 b\u03021 for each day and hour, as in Figure 2.\nTo measure the forecasting accuracy, we used two popular error measures comprising\nthe mean absolute errors (MAE) defined as\nMAEtestm = 1 24 \u00b7#(D) \u2211 d\u2208D 23\u2211 h=0 |Xm,d,h \u2212 X\u0302m,d,h|\nand the RMSE defined as\nRMSEtestm = 1 #(D) \u2211 d\u2208D \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a 1 24 23\u2211 h=0 (Xm,d,h \u2212 X\u0302m,d,h)2\nwhere D is a set containing all 181 forecasted days, #(\u00b7) is a function that returns the number of elements in a set, and X\u0302m,d,h represents the respective forecasted value.\nThe averages over the MAEs and RMSEs for the overall price classes are shown in Figure 6. The top-down and aggregated-down approaches using historical proportions yielded worse results than the simple bottom-up method. Therefore, we do not include these results but they can be inspected in the comprehensive Tables 12 and 13. For the supply curve, the optimal lambda reconciliation approach obtained the smallest MAE on average, approximately 33 MWh lower than that with the marginal model. For the demand curve, the optimal shrinkage reconciliation approach returned the smallest MAE on average, approximatively 97 MWh lower than that of with the marginal model. Similar results were obtained in terms of RMSEs, with differences of approx. 39 MWh and 109 MWh for the supply and demand curves respectively.\nTable 5 shows the absolute MAE and percentage differences for some selected classes and the mean over all classes. Again, we do not include the results for the top-down and aggregated-down approaches using historical proportions for the same reasons stated\nfor Figure 6. When using historical values to calculate the proportions, the top-down approach was superior to aggregated-down. However, using forecasted values to calculate the proportions for the aggregated-down approach yielded better results than the bottomup case on average. The top-down approach still yielded less accurate values than the bottom-up approach even when using forecasted values to calculate the proportions. Hence, aggregated-down was superior to bottom-up and top-down only when using forecasted values for the proportions.\nTables 12 and 13 in the Appendix show the detailed MAEs and RMSEs over each price class. For the supply curve, no approach consistently yielded the lowest errors across all price classes. For example, the first three price classes had the lowest MAEs and RMSEs using the simple bottom-up approach. The cumulative and marginal models in the tables refer to simply forecasting all bottom-level values with the corresponding marginal or cumulative regressors and simply cumulatively summing them up, which corresponds to a bottom-up approach. It should be noted that in the results tables, the explicit bottom-up approach is equal to the cumulative approach per definition. The optimal weighted least squares (WLS) reconciliation approach yielded the lowest errors for the largest number of classes, followed by the shrinkage and lambda approaches. For the demand curve, the results were consistent for all classes, where the lowest errors were achieved by the optimal\nshrinkage reconciliation approach (option 5 among the Section 3.3)."

            "text": "In this study, we considered the hierarchical structure of aggregated curves and different representations. We presented several reconciliation methods comprising established bottom-up, top-down, and minimum-trace optimal reconciliation approaches in an aggregated curves setting [Wickramasuriya et al., 2019]. In addition, we introduced a new\naggregated-down approach with comparable methodological complexity to the bottom-up and top-down approaches. We provided a theoretical insight that under mild assumptions regarding the forecasting and reconciling method, the reconciling result is independent of the representation of the curve. These approaches were then applied in a simulation study, and for forecasting the supply and demand curves of the German day-ahead electricity market. In the latter case, we showed that the reconciling approaches for aggregated curves can improve forecasting accuracy compared with the standard approaches.\nThe results showed that there is a single reconciliation method did not outperform the others every time. However, the Section 3.3 (optimal approaches), particularly the shrinkage, WLS, and lambda approaches, obtained the best results in most cases, where they obtained considerable improvements compared with the bottom-up base case. The reconciliation method that improves the forecast by the greates amount will probably be specific to the data.\nWe suggest that it may be useful to consider multiple methods because even simple approaches such as Section 3.2 (aggregated-down) yielded improvements at certain points on the curve compared with the bottom-up approach, which is the current state-of-the-art method [Ziel and Steinert, 2016, 2018, Haben et al., 2021b]. Based on our finding that the top-down approach did not improve the forecasts on average whereas the aggregateddown approach using forecasted values to calculate proportions obtained improvements, we conclude that the aggregated-down approach can be applied as a simple benchmark method that is superior to top-down. In addition, we conclude that it is important to have access to all base forecasts to calculate the proportions because they can lead to substantial improvements in the forecasts compared with only using historical values.\nOur study could be extended further by including more recent approaches, such as machine-learning-based [Spiliotis et al., 2021] and conditional coherency reconciliation methods [Di Fonzo and Girolimetto, 2021]. Averaging or using different reconciliation approaches for each point on the aggregated curve could also be considered, especially if coherency is not necessary."
