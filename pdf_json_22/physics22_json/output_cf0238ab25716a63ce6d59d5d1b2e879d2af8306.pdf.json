    "abstractText": "The Onsager algebra is one of the cornerstones of exactly solvable models in statistical mechanics. Starting from the generalised Clifford algebra, we demonstrate its relations to the graph Temperley\u2013Lieb algebra, and a generalisation of the Onsager algebra. We present a series of quantum lattice models as representations of the generalised Clifford algebra, possessing the structure of a special type of the generalised Onsager algebra [1]. The integrability of those models is presented, analogous to the free fermionic eightvertex model. We also mention further extensions of the models and physical properties related to the generalised Onsager algebras, hinting at a general framework that includes families of quantum lattice models possessing the structure of the generalised Onsager algebras.",

            "text": "Exactly solvable models [2\u20134] play an important role in statistical mechanics, providing us with the possibility to obtain analytical and mathematically rigorous results that are scarce when the physical systems are interacting. One of the first examples of exactly solvable models is the Onsager\u2019s solution to the two-dimensional classical Ising model [5] in 1944. Onsager used the Onsager algebra to obtain the partition function of the two-dimensional classical Ising model in the absence of the magnetic field. Since then, the Onsager algebra has become a useful tool to study many classical statistical mechanical and quantum lattice models, such as the chiral Potts model [6,7] and the ZN -symmetric spin chain [8,9]. In addition, the Onsager algebra is closely related to quantum integrability [10] and Kramers\u2013Wannier duality [11\u201313], offering many facets on understanding exactly solvable models to us. More recently, the Onsager algebra has been conjectured to be present in a series of quantum integrable systems at root of unity values of anisotropy [14\u201316], e.g. the spin-1/2 quantum XXZ model at root of unity with quasi-periodic boundary conditions 1, hinting at an intriguing relation to the representation theory of quantum groups. The Onsager algebra is also closely related to quantum manybody scars [17], a subset of the eigenstates of non-integrable quantum systems that have nontrivial out-of-equilibrium behaviour. The Onsager algebra can be used to solve the dynamics of interacting quantum systems [18] as well.\nFrom the mathematical perspective, the Onsager algebra is an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra [19], which is a fixed-point subalgebra of the sl2 loop algebra [15, 20]. Recently the alternating presentation and its central extension of the Onsager algebra has been studied in [21, 22]. The close relation between the Onsager algebra and the classical Yang\u2013Baxter algebras has been investigated in [23]. There are few ways to extend the Onsager algebra. One is to consider the q-deformation of the model, the q-Onsager algebra [24\u201326], a coideal subalgebra of affine Uq(s\u0302l2), with connections to the quantum XXZ model with open boundary conditions. The alternating presentation and its central extension of the q-Onsager algebra can be found in [27,28]. Meanwhile, one can consider a generalisation of the Onsager algebra as a Lie subalgebra of certain Kac-Moody algebra that satisfies Dolan\u2013Grady-like relations. One of the first attempts is the so-called \u201csln Onsager algebra\u201d [29], i.e. a Lie subalgebra of the affine Lie algebra A(1)n\u22121. Results for other generalisations can be found in [30], even in the presence of the q-deformation [25, 31]. Recently, a systematic construction of this type of generalisations was presented in [1], dubbed \u201cgeneralised Onsager algebras\u201d, classifying all the Lie subalgebras of different Kac\u2013Moody algebras with Dolan\u2013Grady-like relations. In the meantime, the Yang\u2013Baxter algebra presentation of the generalised Onsager algebras has been studied in [23,32]. The result of [1] serves as a motivation for this article, where we try to find physically relevant models that consists of parts as the representation of a certain generalised\n1For certain roots of unity, e.g. q = exp(i\u03c0/2) for spin 1/2 or q = exp(i\u03c0/3) for spin 1, the Onsager algebra can be found explicitly for the spin-1/2 XXZ model or the spin-1 Zamolodchikov\u2013Fateev model [14], where the Onsager generators consist of local operators. When we are at other roots of unity, the Onsager generators are expected to have quasi-local density [15].\nOnsager algebra. Indeed, we discover an elegant connection between the generalised Clifford algebra, defined in Section 2, and one type of the generalised Onsager algebras, defined in [1], which possesses a representation related to the Fendley model [33\u201336], a model of mediumrange spin interactions having free fermionic spectra with open boundary conditions. We show that the Fendley model with periodic boundary condition (i.e. interacting) can be expressed in terms of operators satisfying the generalised Onsager algebra, and is integrable, where we present a different approach compared to the one in [33], analogous to the free fermionic eight-vertex model.\nThe outline of the article is as follows. We introduce the generalised Clifford algebra, the key figure of this article, and its relation to the graph Temperley-Lieb algebra and generalised Onsager algebra. We present the physically relevant representations of the generalised Clifford algebra, including the transverse field Ising model and free fermionic eight-vertex model. Most importantly, the Fendley model consists of operators that belong to a representation of the generalised Clifford algebra as well as a special type of the generalised Onsager algebra, which is the first quantum lattice model associated with the generalised Onsager algebra to the best of our knowledge. Since the Onsager algebra implies integrability of the model, we proceed with presenting the integrability of the Fendley model motivated by recent works on medium-range quantum integrable models [37,38]. Eventually, we present the chiral-Potts-like generalisation of the Fendley model where the generalised Onsager algebra remains, before ending the article with conclusions and outlook."

            "text": "We start with defining the generalised Clifford algebra (GCA) [34,35,39,40], whose representation plays a crucial roles in the following.\nThe generalised Clifford algebra GC(r, N) is a unital associative algebra over the complex numbers with generators h1, h2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , hN satisfying\nh2j = id , h jh j+m = \u2212h j+mh j , 1\u2264 m\u2264 r , h jh j+n = h j+nh j n\u2265 r + 1, 1\u2264 j \u2264 N , (1)\nwith \u201cperiodic boundary conditions\u201d hN+k \u2261 hk, k \u2265 1. When r = 1, it becomes the usual Clifford algebra. As illustrated in Fig. 1, for GC(2,6),\nh1h5 = \u2212h5h1 , h1h4 = h4h1, (2)\netc. There are many known representations of the GCA that are relevant to exactly solvable models. The most renowned one is the transverse field Ising model (TFIM) as a representation of GC(1, N). The explicit constructions are given in Section 3.1.\nWe move on to the \u201cperiodic graph Temperley\u2013Lieb (TL) algebra\u201d GTL(\u03b2 , r, N) [41]. As demonstrated below, we obtain a quotient of the algebra GTL( p 2, r, N) from the GCA. It is defined as the unital associative algebra over the complex numbers with generators e1, e2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 eN , satisfying\ne2j = \u03b2e j , e je j\u00b1me j = e j , 1\u2264 m\u2264 r , e je j+n = e j+ne j n\u2265 r + 1, 1\u2264 j \u2264 N , (3)\nwith eN+k \u2261 ek, k \u2265 1.\nRemark. The algebra GTL(\u03b2 , 1, N) is very similar to the periodic (affine) Temperley-Lieb algebra [42], which is a quotient of the affine Hecke algebra [43]. However, the main difference here is that we do not require the existence of the element g from the periodic TL algebra, such that\nge j g \u22121 = e j+1 . (4)\nUsually we can define an operator G for the physical relevent representations of GTL(\u03b2 , r, N) that satisfies the relation (4), in the form of right translational operator. However, it is a bit complicated to define such an operator for Ising or Potts like models. The existence of g does not affect the discussions about the relations to the generalised Onsager algebra. Therefore, we do not require the existence of g in our definition of GTL(\u03b2 , r, N).\nFrom the algebra GC(r, N), we can construct a map from a quotient of GTL( p\n2, r, N), i.e. GTL\u2032( p 2, r, N), to GC(r, N)\ne\u2032j \u2192 1 p\n2 (id+ h j) , (5)\nsatisfying (3). Generators e\u2032j satisfy the following relations in addition to the definition of GTL( p 2, r, N) (3), {e\u2032j , e \u2032 j+m}= p 2(e\u2032j + e \u2032 j+m) , 1\u2264 m\u2264 r . (6) For the sake of convenience, we shall use the algebra GTL( p\n2, r, N) and its definition (3) mainly for the rest of the article.\nFinally, we focus on a special type of generalisation of the Onsager algebra GO(r + 1) defined in Definition 2.5 of [1]. The algebra GO(r + 1) is an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra. Without diving into the full definition, for which we refer the readers to [1], we use the generalised Dolan\u2013Grady presentation of the algebra GO(r + 1) with only (r + 1)-many generators A(s), 0 \u2264 s \u2264 r, which are enough to generate the rest of the infinitely many ones. The r + 1\ngenerators A(s) satisfy the Dolan\u2013Grady relation between any pair of them,\nA(s), A(s), A(s), A(t)\n= 16 A(s), A(t) , \u2200s, t \u2208 {0,1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , r} . (7)\nAs shown in [1], the algebra GO(r+1) is a fixed-point Lie subalgebra of a Kac\u2013Moody algebra g with generalised Cartan matrix of dimension (r + 1)\n\n    \n2 \u22122 \u22122 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u22122 \u22122 \u22122 2 \u22122 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u22122 \u22122 ... . . . ... \u22122 \u22122 \u22122 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 2 \u22122 \u22122 \u22122 \u22122 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u22122 2\n\n     . (8)\nThe mathematical curiosities of the Kac\u2013Moody algebra here are mentioned in Ref. [44], which is not the main focus of this paper.\nWhen r = 1, we have GO(2), which is the renowned Onsager algebra, which possesses the Kramers\u2013Wannier duality A(0)\u2194 A(1) [12],\nA(0), A(0), A(0), A(1)\n= 16 A(0), A(1) ,\nA(1), A(1), A(1), A(0)\n= 16 A(1), A(0) . (9)\nThe cases of GO(r + 1) with r \u2265 2 therefore possess a generalised version of the Kramers\u2013 Wannier duality,\nA(s)\u2194 A(t) , \u2200s, t \u2208 {0,1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , r} , (10)\nthat leaves the algebra invariant. There exists a map GO(r+1)\u2192 GC(r, N) with N mod(r+1) = 0 which is injective, where\nA(s)\u2192 N/(r+1) \u2211\nj=1\nh(r+1) j\u2212s , s \u2208 {0,1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , r} . (11)\nSince we also have a map GTL\u2032( p\n2, r, N) \u2192 GC(r, N) (5), we obtain a map GO(r + 1)\u2192 GTL\u2032( p 2, r, N), i.e.\nA(s)\u2192 N/(r+1) \u2211\nj=1\n( p\n2e(r+1) j\u2212s \u2212 id) , s \u2208 {0,1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , r} . (12)\nIn this section, we have shown that the algebra GC(r, N) has two homomorphisms, one to GTL\u2032( p 2, r, N) and another to GO(r + 1). In the following sections, we will study certain physically relevant representations of the algebra GC(r, N), which constitute the Fendley model [33\u201336]."

(19)\nThe same construction of (16) and its relation to the Onsager algebra have been studied in [45,46].\nThe operators A(0)IM and A (1) IM satisfy the Dolan\u2013Grady relation (9) and the duality between the two operators is the renowned Kramers\u2013Wannier duality. In fact, we can rewrite the TFIM Hamiltonian in terms of the Onsager generators,\nHIM(\u03bb) = \u03bbA(0)IM +A (1) IM , (20)\nand by using the self-duality we can predict a phase transition happening at \u03bb\u2192 1 [12,47]. The TFIM is solvable, as it can be mapped into a free fermionic model via the Jordan\u2013 Wigner transformation, and it can be considered as the quantum limit of the two-dimensional classical Ising model [47\u201349]. The relation between the algebra GO(1,2L) and generalisations of the Jordan\u2013Wigner transformation has been discussed in [45, 46, 50]. A different generalisation of to the cluster XY-models that possess a similar structure of the Onsager algebra is presented in [51].\nThe additional conserved operator here is of particular interest. In the case of TFIM, we have\nH(0,1)IM = i 2\n2L \u2211\nj=1\nhIMj h IM j+1 =\nL \u2211\nj=1\n1 2 \u03c3xj \u03c3 y j+1 \u2212\u03c3 y j \u03c3 x j+1 , (21)\nwhich is the spin current of the spin-1/2 XXZ model [52]. With a unitary transformation, H(0,1)IM becomes the spin-1/2 XX model, i.e. spin-1/2 XXZ model at root of unity q = i. This means that spin-1/2 XX model, despite being free fermionic, commutes with all the Onsager generators, cf. Appendix A. This observation serves as a starting point for the conjecture of the presence of the Onsager algebra symmetry for the spin-1/2 XXZ model at arbitrary root of unity [15,16].\nIn addition to the well-known TFIM, there are a few more physically relevant representations of the algebra GC(r, N) as we present in the following."

However, the spectra of the Hamiltonians do not satisfy the free fermionic condition in [53] with the periodic boundary condition. This can be observed from numerically obtaining the eigenvalues of (29), as shown in Fig. 2. In principle, this do not exclude the possibility that the spectra cannot be partitioned into subsectors that are free fermionic. The most notable example is the TFIM with periodic boundary condition, where the spectrum can be divided into two parts that are free fermionic. In the case of the Fendley model, it is less clear whether such partition of the spectrum into free fermionic parts exists. Moreover, unlike the TFIM, the non-local transformation constructed in [33] no longer applies for periodic boundary. The question whether the Fendley model is intrinsically interacting is postponed to future investigation.\n2What we refer to as \u201cfree fermionic spectra\u201d is defined in Eq.

In this article, we instead take a different approach similar to [37] which has a four-dimensional auxiliary space (tensored space with two spin-1/2s) when r = 2, revealing a hidden connection to the integrability of the free fermionic eight-vertex model, presented in Sec. 4.2.\nRemark. The transfer matrix in [33] can be applied to the r = 2 Fendley model with inhomogenous couplings and periodic boundary. However, the method in Sec. 4.2 only works for the homogenous case (31). Instead, we can add inhomogeneities in the transfer matrix (64) constructed in Sec. 4.2, which will result in another Hamiltonian with longer-range interaction.\nThere is a hidden supersymmetric algebra too, desribed in [33]. The observation is that there is a \u201cdual representation\u201d for the same algebra GC(L, r),\nh j 7\u2192 h\u0303FM[ j, j+r] = \u03c3 \u03b2 j \u03c3 \u03b2 j+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03c3 \u03b2 j+r\u22121\u03c3 \u03b1 j+r , (32)\nsuch that\nhFM[ j, j+r], h\u0303 FM [k,k+r] = 0 , \u2200 j, k \u2208 {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , L} .

(62)\nIndeed, with the parametrisation of the Lax operator (61), there exists the R matrix that serves as the intertwiner for the Yang\u2013Baxter relation,\nRFM(a,b)(c,d)(u, v)L FM a,b, j(u)L FM c,d, j(v) = L FM c,d, j(v)L FM a,b, j(u)R FM (a,b)(c,d)(u, v) , (63)\nwhere the R matrix acts non-trivially on 2 four-dimensional auxiliary spaces, i.e. a 16\u00d716 matrix. The R matrix is not of difference form, and it can be obtained via solving linear equations from the Yang\u2013Baxter relation. The result of the R matrix is presented in Appendix C.\nWith the Yang\u2013Baxter relation, we construct the monodromy matrix and the transfer matrix by tracing over both auxiliary spaces a and b,\nMFMa,b(u) = L \u220f\nj=1\nLa,b, j(u) , T FM(u) = tra,bM FM a,b(u) , (64)\nsuch that\nTFM(u),TFM(v) = 0 , \u2200u, v \u2208 C . (65)\nWe can therefore construct conserved charges with local density by taking the logarithmic derivative of the transfer matrix, the same as in the free fermionic eight-vertex models,\nQFMn+1 = i\u2202 n u logT FM(u) u=0 , (66)\nin particular, the Hamiltonian can be written as\nHFM = QFM2 = i\u2202 1 u logT FM(u) u=0 . (67)\nMore interestingly, the density of the higher order charges can be expressed as the Hamiltonian\u2019s local terms, e.g.\nQFM3 = i\u2202 2 u logT FM(u) u=0\n= \u22122i L \u2211\nj=1\nhFMj h FM j+1 + h FM j h FM j+2\n+ L . (68)\nWhen the system size L mod3 = 0, we define the additional commuting operators for the generalised Onsager generators the same as (13), i.e.\nH(s,t)FM = i 2\nL/3 \u2211\nj=1\nhFM3 j\u2212sh FM 3 j\u2212t + h FM 3 j\u2212th FM 3 j+3\u2212s . (69)\nIn this case, we express the third-order charge as the sum of the additional commuting operators (while they do not commute among themselves),\nQFM3 = \u22124(H (0,1) FM +H (0,2) FM +H (1,2) FM ) + L . (70)\nSimilar to the free fermionic eight-vertex model, the \u201cdual Hamiltonian\u201d for the Fendley model reads\nH\u0303FM = L \u2211\nj=1\nh\u0303FM[ j, j+r] , h\u0303 FM [ j, j+r] = \u03c3 x j \u03c3 x j+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03c3 x j+r\u22121\u03c3 y j+r , (71)\nwith h\u0303FM[ j, j+r],h FM [k,k+r] = 0, \u2200 j, k. When r = 2, we have h\u0303[ j, j+2] = \u03c3xj \u03c3 x j+1\u03c3 y j+2. We thus conjecture that the total Hamiltonian\nHFM(\u03b8 ) = L \u2211\nj=1\nhFMj (\u03b8 ) , h FM j (\u03b8 ) = cos\u03b8h FM j + sin\u03b8 h\u0303 FM j (72)\nis integrable too. In fact, imitating the construction of (53), we conjecture the following Lax operator\nLFMa,b, j(z,\u03b8 ) =\n1+ p\n2 2\nz \u2212 z\u22121\n2\nhFMa,b, j(\u03b8 ) + 1 2\nz + z\u22121\n2 \u2212 1\nhFMa,b, j(\u03b8 ) 2 Pb, jPa, j (73)\ngives rise the monodromy matrix and the transfer matrix defined as\nMFMa,b(z,\u03b8 ) = L \u220f\nj=1\nLFMa,b, j(z,\u03b8 ) , T FM(z,\u03b8 ) = tra,bM FM a,b(z,\u03b8 ) , (74)\nsuch that\nTFM(z,\u03b8 ),TFM(w,\u03b8 ) = 0 , z, w \u2208 C . (75)\nNumerically we have checked for systems with L \u2264 14, where (75) works. Moreover, the Hamiltonian (72) can be obtained as a local conserved charge from the conjectured transfer matrix\nHFM = i\u2202z logT FM(z,\u03b8 ) z=1 . (76)\nThis is guaranteed by the conjecture that the R matrix (intertwiner) exists, satisfying the Yang\u2013Baxter relation\nRFM(a,b)(c,d)(z, w,\u03b8 )L FM a,b, j(z,\u03b8 )L FM c,d, j(w,\u03b8 ) = L FM c,d, j(w,\u03b8 )L FM a,b, j(z,\u03b8 )R FM (a,b)(c,d)(z, w,\u03b8 ) , (77)\nand\nRFM(a,b)(c,d)(z, w,\u03b8 )R FM (a,b)(e, f )(z, x ,\u03b8 )R FM (c,d)(e, f )(w, x ,\u03b8 ) = RFM(a,b)(e, f )(z, x ,\u03b8 )R FM (c,d)(e, f )(w, x ,\u03b8 )R FM (a,b)(c,d)(z, w,\u03b8 ) .\n(78)\nThere are a few limits where the R matrix is known, such as \u03b8 = n\u03c02 , n \u2208 Z, cf. Appendix C. In principle, we would like to obtain the R matrix RFM(a,b)(c,d)(z, w,\u03b8 ) by requiring it to satisfy the\nYang\u2013Baxter relation (77). However, the procedure is tedious even for symbolic calculation software on a laptop. We shall leave the exact form of the R matrix to later consideration.\nEven though it is cumbersome to get the exact expression for the conjectured R matrix, we still can write down two simple limits that the conjectured R matrix has to fulfil,\nRFM(a,b)(c,d)(z, 1,\u03b8 ) = L FM a,b,c(z)L FM a,b,d(z) , (79)\nand RFM(a,b)(c,d)(1, w,\u03b8 )\u221d LFMc,d,b \u22121 (w) LFMc,d,a \u22121 (w) . (80)\nThese two limits are analytically checked and indeed they are both fulfilled. In addition to considering the total Hamiltonian (72), there is another generalisation to the Fendley model, similar to the apporach to obtain the Q-state chiral Potts model from transverse field Ising model. By doing so, we keep the generalised Onsager algebra GO(r +1) intact. We outline the construction in the following section."

            "text": "Similar to the chiral Potts model as an extension of the TFIM model, while keeping the Onsager algebra intact, we also extend the Fendley model to its chiral counterparts [34]. In order to achieve that, we first generalise the algebra GC(r, N) into GC(r, N ,Q), where the generators h1, h2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , hN satisfy\nhQj = id , h jh j+m =\u03c9h j+mh j , \u03c9= exp 2i\u03c0 Q , 1\u2264 m\u2264 r ,\nh jh j+n = h j+nh j , n\u2265 r + 1, 1\u2264 j \u2264 N , (81)\nwith the same periodic boundary condition and Q \u2208 Z>0. It is obvious that the algebra GC(r, N)\u2261 GC(r, N ,Q = 2).\nWith some algebraic manipulations, we can find presentations of the \u201ccoupled graph Temperley-Lieb algebra\u201d and the generalised Onsager algebra GO(r + 1) as before. The \u201ccoupled graph Temperley-Lieb algebra\u201d is defined as follows:\ne(k)j 2 = \u03b2e(k)j , e (k) j e (l) j\u00b1me (k) j = e (k) j , 1\u2264 m\u2264 r, 1\u2264 k, l \u2264Q\u2212 1,\ne(k)j e (l) j+n = e (l) j+ne (k) j n\u2265 r + 1, 1\u2264 j \u2264 N , 1\u2264 k, l \u2264Q\u2212 1 e(k)j e (l) j \u2212 0 , k 6= l, 1\u2264 k, l \u2264Q\u2212 1 .\n(82)\nThe algebra GTL(\u03b2 , r, N) is a subalgebra of the \u201ccoupled graph Temperley-Lieb algebra\u201d, when fixing e j \u2261 e (k) j . When r = 1, it becomes the coupled Temperley-Lieb algebra, which has a physically relevant representation being the Q-state chiral Potts model [59] with \u03b2 = p\nN . Here instead we have\ne(k)j = 1 p\nQ\nQ \u2211\na=1\n\u03c9kh j a , (83)\nwith \u03c9 being the Q-th root of unity as above, satisfying the relations of the \u201ccoupled graph Temperley-Lieb algebra\u201d (82) with \u03b2 = p N .\nMoreover, for the generalised Onsager algebra GO(r + 1), we find the following presentation from GO(r, N ,Q):\nA(s) = 2 Q\nN/(r+1) \u2211\nj=1\nQ\u22121 \u2211\na=1\nha(r+1) j\u2212s 1\u2212\u03c9\u2212a , s \u2208 {0,1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , r} , (84)\nsatisfying the Dolan\u2013Grady relation (9) with N mod (r + 1) = 0. When we choose Q = 2, we recover the results in the previous sections.\nWithout delving into the details, we give two representations of the algebras above, one being the Q-state chiral Potts model, the other being a chiral-Potts-like generalisation of the Fendley model. The physical properties and other implications are postponed to future investigations.\n5.1 Representations of GC(r, N ,Q)\nTo begin with, we introduce the clock operators acting on the vector space (CQ)\u2297L ,\nX j =\n\n    \n0 1 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 ... . . . . . . ... 0 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 1 1 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0\n\n    \nj\n, Z j =\n\n    \n1 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0 \u03c9 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 ... . . . ... 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c9Q\u22122 0 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 \u03c9Q\u22121\n\n    \nj\n. (85)\nThe operators satisfy\nXQj = Z Q j = 1 , X jZ j =\u03c9Z jX j ,\nX j ,Xm = Z j ,Zm = X j ,Zm = 0, j 6= m . (86)\nWhen Q = 2, the clock operators become Pauli matrices, X j \u2192 \u03c3xj and Z j \u2192 \u03c3 z j .\nFirstly, we consider the representation of the algebra GO(1, 2L,Q), where\nh2 j\u22121 7\u2192 hCP2 j\u22121 = Z j , h2 j 7\u2192 h CP 2 j X jX \u2020 j+1 . (87)\nThe chiral Potts model is defined as\nHCP = L \u2211\nj=1\nQ\u22121 \u2211\na=1\n\n\u03bb\nhCP2 j\u22121 a\n1\u2212\u03c9\u2212a +\nhCP2 j a\n1\u2212\u03c9\u2212a\n\n= \u03bb Q 2 A(0)CP + Q 2 A(1)CP , (88)\nwith the Onsager generators\nA(0) 7\u2192 A(0)CP = 2 Q\nL \u2211\nj=1\nQ\u22121 \u2211\na=1\nhCP2 j\u22121 a\n1\u2212\u03c9\u2212a , A(1) 7\u2192 A(1)CP = 2 Q\nL \u2211\nj=1\nQ\u22121 \u2211\na=1\nhCP2 j a\n1\u2212\u03c9\u2212a . (89)\nIt is well-known that the Q-state chiral Potts model consists of the two parts forming a representation of the Onsager algebra. The relation to the coupled Temperley-Lieb algebra is similar to the Ising case, and it has been discussed in details in [59].\nMore interestingly, we can simply generalise the Fendley model in a similar manner. We consider the following representation of the algebra GC(r, L,Q) acting on the vector space (CQ)\u2297L ,\nh j 7\u2192 hCPFMj = X jX j+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7X j+r\u22121Z j+r . (90)\nThe chiral-Potts-like generalisation of the Fendley model thus can be expressed as\nHCPFM = L \u2211\nj=1\nQ\u22121 \u2211\na=1\nhCPFMj a\n1\u2212\u03c9\u2212a , (91)\nwhich is Hermitian, the same as the chiral Potts model (88).\nRemark. If instead we consider another Hamiltonian with open boundary condition,\nH\u2032 = L\u2212r \u2211\nj=1\n\u03be jh CPFM j , \u03be j \u2208 R , (92)\nwe arrive at a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with free parafermionic [53] spectra, as discussed in details in [35]. In the meantime, the chiral-Potts-like generalisation of the Fendley model (91) is always interacting and Hermitian.\nThe generalised Onsager algebra GO(r + 1) has a similar representation with L mod (r + 1) = 0, i.e.\nA(s) 7\u2192 A(s)CPFM = 2 Q\nL/(r+1) \u2211\nj=1\nQ\u22121 \u2211\na=1\nhCPFM(r+1) j\u2212s a\n1\u2212\u03c9\u2212a , (93)\nwhich leads to the following rewriting of the Hamiltonian (91)\nHCPFM = r \u2211\ns=0\nA(s)CPFM . (94)\nWe expect the phase diagram and the existence of the \u201cdual Hamiltonian\u201d to be the same as the Q = 2 case, i.e. the Fendley model discussed previously. However, the phase transitions are expected to be different from the Fendley model. Since the generalised Onsager algebra is present in the generalisation too, we expect that the chiral-Potts-like generalisation is also integrable. Yet the Lax operator and the R matrix are needed to be constructed, which should be more complex than the ones of the Fendley model. We reserve all those intriguing questions for the future work."

Then we continue with its representations. Above all, the Fendley model can be expressed in terms of the operators of the representation of GC(r, N). This reveals the relation between the Fendley model and the generalised Onsager algebra GO(r + 1), which has gone undetected previously. The integrability of the Fendley model with the periodic boundary condition is considered next, analogous to the free fermionic eight-vertex model case. We discuss the chiral-Potts-like generalisation of the Fendley model in the end.\nThe existence of self-dualities is ubiquitous when we consider the generalised Onsager algebra, as demonstrated in previous sections. In fact, with the duality itself, we are able to extract numerous physical properties of the model. This has been well exploited in the \u201cbond algebra approach\u201d [60\u201363], where the \u201cbond algebra\u201d refers to the algebra of the local terms of the Hamiltonian, i.e. the generalised Clifford algebra GO(r, N) in the scope of this article. Together with the graph theoretical approach to quantum lattice models [36,64], it is intriguing to combine different methods to discover new \u201cbond algebras\u201d that possess similar self-duality structures.\nEven though we have shown that the Fendley model and its generalisations are closely related to the generalised Onsager algebra, many intriguing aspects have not been discussed in the current article. Most notably, we would like to understand how the generalised Onsager algebra affects the physical properties of the Fendley model and its chiral-Potts-like generalisation, e.g. the phase transitions and its complete spectrum. Meanwhile, it is worth investigating the mathematical structure of the R matrix of the Fendley model and its relation to the\ngeneralised Onsager algebra. The hidden extended supersymmetry algebra shown in [33] is beyond the scope of the article. The relation between the extended supersymmetry algebra and the generalised Onsager algebra is missing at the moment. Ultimately, the generalised Onsager algebra, the quantum integrability and the extended supersymmetry should be comprehended under one roof for the Fendley model and the chiral-Potts-like generalisation. The article should be considered as an appetiser for the more ambitious and intriguing questions both in theoretical physics and mathematics mentioned above."

(C.4)\nMoreover, the inverse of the R matrix can be obtained by permuting the auxiliary spaces and spectral parameters, i.e.\nRFM(a,b)(c,d)(u, v)R FM (c,d)(a,b)(v, u) = 2[cosh(4u) + cosh(4v)\u2212 2 sinh(2u) sinh(2v)] [cosh(2u) + cosh(2v)]2 .
