1. **Investigate the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in neuro-tourism studies.** 
Current research shows a lack of AI integration in neuro-tourism, despite its potential to create cutting-edge AI systems that anticipate traveler preferences or desires and thus generate individualized travel experiences. Future studies could explore the use of AI in neuro-tourism, such as developing AI-powered systems that can analyze neuro-tourism data to identify patterns and trends, or using AI to create personalized travel recommendations based on an individual's brain activity.


2. **Examine the use of neuro-tourism methods to understand the impact of tourism on mental health and well-being.** 
Neuro-tourism research has primarily focused on understanding tourist emotions and decision-making in the context of marketing and advertising. Future studies could investigate how neuro-tourism methods can be used to assess the impact of tourism on mental health and well-being. For example, researchers could use neuro-tourism techniques to measure the stress levels of tourists in different environments or to examine the effects of nature exposure on brain activity.


3. **Explore the application of neuro-tourism in sustainable tourism.** 
Neuro-tourism research has the potential to contribute to the development of more sustainable tourism practices. Future studies could investigate how neuro-tourism methods can be used to understand tourist preferences for sustainable tourism products and services. For example, researchers could use neuro-tourism techniques to measure the emotional responses of tourists to sustainable tourism initiatives or to examine the effects of sustainable tourism practices on brain activity.


4. **Investigate the use of neuro-tourism methods to improve the accessibility of tourism for people with disabilities.** 
Neuro-tourism research could be used to develop new technologies and strategies to make tourism more accessible for people with disabilities. Future studies could investigate how neuro-tourism methods can be used to understand the challenges faced by people with disabilities when traveling. For example, researchers could use neuro-tourism techniques to measure the stress levels of people with disabilities in different travel environments or to examine the effects of assistive technologies on brain activity.


5. **Explore the ethical implications of using neuro-tourism methods in the tourism industry.** 
The use of neuro-tourism methods in the tourism industry raises a number of ethical concerns, such as the potential for privacy violations and the manipulation of consumer behavior. Future studies could investigate the ethical implications of using neuro-tourism methods in the tourism industry. For example, researchers could examine how tourists perceive the use of neuro-tourism methods or develop guidelines for the ethical use of neuro-tourism methods in the tourism industry.
