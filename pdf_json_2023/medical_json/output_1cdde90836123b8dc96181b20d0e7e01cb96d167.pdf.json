    "abstractText": "Abstract Both public stigma and perceived self-stigma are prevalent during pandemics threatening a divide among the global community. This systematic review examined the cultural factors associated with viral respiratory-related pandemic stigma. Following PRISMA guidelines, the keywords, \u201cculture, stigma, and pandemic\u201d were searched across relevant databases for empirical papers between January 2000 to March 2022. Quality assessment and coding were adopted in the screening process. Thirty-one articles were included in the final analysis. Themes revealed that collectivistic values, cultural identities, and non-western regions were associated with public (others) stigma; mismatch of cultural values, minority groups, and North America, Asia, Oceania, and African regions were associated with higher perceived and self-stigma. We further mapped the themes into a proposed systemic cultural stigma model to integrate the dynamic intersection of cultural values, identity, and ecology. The cultural factors and their influence on stigma were then explained by drawing on two evolutionary theories: Cultural rationality theory and scapegoating theory. Lastly, we proposed culturally sensitive and responsive practices for stigma management at the community level, especially in non-Western regions during the pandemic recovery phase.",

Pandemics affect societies through physical illness and mortality, as well as a range of disruptions, including economic, social, and political consequences (Qiu et\u00a0al., 2017). In particular, pandemics related to viral respiratory infections (VRIs), such as influenza (e.g., H1N1) or coronaviruses (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], COVID-19), tend to trigger higher anxiety among the general population due to its life-threatening and highly contagious nature (Saeed et\u00a0al., 2020). In addition, given VRIs\u2019 ease of transmission through air and water droplets (Ong et\u00a0al., 2020), public\nhealth control measures for VRI-induced pandemics generally require mass lockdown of public spaces and quarantine of high-risk groups. Such measures further reinforce public fear and isolation (Ren et\u00a0al., 2020), which may leave individuals or groups associated with VRIs (e.g., countries of origin, highly infected regions, frontliners, patients, caretakers) especially vulnerable to stigmatization.\nFrom the perspective of cultural psychology, scholars have proposed that culture plays an important role in stigmatizing attitudes and experiences, due to its underlying moral cognition (Yang et\u00a0al., 2007). While there have been some commentaries highlighting the effect of culture on stigmatization during pandemics (e.g., Biswas et\u00a0al., 2021; Bruns et\u00a0al., 2020), there is still a gap in the synthesis of evidencebased studies to understand the cultural determinants of stigma during pandemics. Our study aimed to bridge this gap by conducting a systematic review of the published empirical articles in the past 21\u00a0years, to understand the role of culture on the perception of stigma towards others and self during VRIs pandemic. We aimed to advocate for culturally responsive and sensitive community services during the post-pandemic era, especially among the marginalized minorities. * May Kyi Zay Hta May.ZayHta@monash.edu * Rachel Sing-Kiat Ting Ting.SingKiat@monash.edu\n1 Department of\u00a0Psychology, Jeffrey Cheah School of\u00a0Medicine and\u00a0Health Sciences, Monash University Malaysia, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Selangor, Malaysia\n1 3"

            "text": "Stigmatization is defined as the differentiation and labeling of a collective group of individuals based on their characteristics, attributes, qualities, or status (Goffman, 1968). This usually leads stigmatized individuals or groups to experience social exclusion, discrimination, humiliation, and marginalization from the mainstream (e.g., Saeed et\u00a0al., 2020). At the broadest level, stigma can be categorized into two distinct constructs, namely, public stigma and self-stigma (Corrigan & Watson, 2002). From a social psychological perspective, we adopted this broad definition of stigma in our systematic review, where public stigma refers to an individual expressing stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors towards others, and self-stigma is the perception of being stigmatized."

            "heading": "Public stigma",
            "text": "Public stigma is defined as the negative beliefs and attitudes one holds that lead to fear, avoidance, rejection, or discrimination towards individuals with the disadvantaged condition (Corrigan & Penn, 1999; Parcesepe & Cabassa, 2013). In the context of the pandemic, the publicly stigmatized populations may include infected persons or those perceived to be at a higher risk of being infected, such as healthcare workers, family members, or people of a particular nationality or ethnicity, through associative stigma (Bhanot et\u00a0al., 2021; Duan et\u00a0al., 2020; Goffman, 1968; Hoppe, 2018). Public stigma, especially in the context of infectious diseases, can be explained through the evolutionary perspective of \u201cothering,\u201d with its function to protect oneself and one\u2019s in-groups (Kurzban & Leary, 2001). Stigmatizing others is viewed as an act of adapting to increase the chances of both individual and in-group survival from the \u201cperceived threat\u201d\u2014infected persons, or individuals or groups perceived to have associated attributes with the disease. To the individual, the phenomenon of separating between \u201cthem\u201d and \u201cus\u201d allows the idea of distancing from perceived threat; the label \u201cthem\u201d temporarily induces feelings of security and reduces fear and anxiety (Gilmore & Somerville, 1994; Saeed et\u00a0al., 2020). This is especially prominent as epidemics and pandemics are characterized by and exacerbated by fear of the disease and uncertainty (Ren et\u00a0al., 2020; Saeed et\u00a0al., 2020). Hence, pandemics and virus outbreaks would be expected to be accompanied by social stigma toward others.\nSelf\u2011stigma\nIn this study, self-stigma refers to the awareness and perceptions of negative attitudes, prejudice, or discrimination others hold towards them (Corrigan & Rao, 2012; Link, 1987).\nThe self-stigma model proposed by Corrigan and Rao (2012) argues that self-stigma may extend beyond initial awareness and perception of receiving stigma, to individuals internalizing those beliefs, leading to lower self-esteem. Sullivan et\u00a0al. (2014) explained that scapegoating may occur in response to uncontrollable situations, usually towards the minority out-group, with the displacement of anger toward tangible and controllable targets in response to the uncontrollable situation. This is obvious during the pandemic, when the infected or \u201cassociated\u201d people were blamed and discriminated against (e.g., Yang et\u00a0al., 2021). As such, self-stigma usually results from the public projection of fear during the pandemic, where the stigmatized group (either infected or associated) becomes the scapegoat and the out-group. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the self-stigma experiences ranged from feeling ashamed, being blamed, and being rejected, isolated, and abandoned by close ones, as well as the larger community (Duan et\u00a0al., 2020; Nursalam et\u00a0al., 2020; Yuan et\u00a0al., 2021). Effects of self-stigma can also be long-term, extending beyond surviving the disease and even the pandemic itself. For example, SARS survivors struggled against stigma from family and co-workers (Lee et\u00a0al., 2005), and those who were COVID19 positive or quarantined reported self-stigma (e.g., feeling abandoned) even after recovery (Lohiniva et\u00a0al., 2021; Nursalam et\u00a0al., 2020). Hence, it is important to study the nature and mechanism behind self-stigma during both the pandemic and the recovery phase."

            "text": "On the socio-political level, previous research has identified several determinants that are associated with public stigma and self-stigma, including sociodemographic correlates such as education, health literacy, socio-economic status, gender, age, race/ethnicity, exposure to the virus, occupation as a healthcare worker, or the media (see, e.g., Yuan et\u00a0al., 2021). We argue that culture is an additional factor that warrants a systematic study due to how the mechanism of culture interplays with pandemic stigma. While Link et\u00a0al. (2004) viewed stigma as a universal phenomenon across different cultures and societies, Yang et\u00a0al. (2007) highlighted that the experience and the endorsement of stigmatization could be very different and distinct, as stigmatizing actions, reasons, and outcomes differ based on culture. Moreover, some ethnic/ racial identities or nationalities that are perceived to have a higher likelihood of being the carrier of virus or are believed to be the regional origin of the disease are highly stigmatized. (e.g., Bhanot et\u00a0al., 2021; Hoppe, 2018). For example, literature reported that pandemics such as SARS and COVID-19 have been mainly associated with East Asians\n1 3\nor Chinese, especially through media portrayal such as the news (e.g., He et\u00a0al., 2020; Peprah & Gyasi, 2021).\nOn an individual level, there is some evidence that a person\u2019s socio-cultural traits and norms may affect their perceptions and coping with a disease or illness. For example, Ji et\u00a0al. (2020) reported how mainland Chinese had a more optimistic outlook towards the pandemic and the construct of suffering compared to the Euro-Canadians, potentially explained through dialectical thinking, whereby happiness and suffering co-exist in the Chinese population. Guan et\u00a0 al. (2020) also further explained how cultural constructs such as cultural orientation (e.g., collectivism/individualism\u2014Hofstede, 1980; Triandis, 1995), cultural norms (e.g., tight/loose society\u2014Gelfand et\u00a0al., 2011), cultural-prone thinking styles (e.g., holistic/analytic\u2014Nisbett et\u00a0 al., 2001) and self-construal (independent/ interdependent\u2014Markus & Kitayama, 1991) impacted coping during the COVID-19 pandemic. Together, these different studies and approaches point to the close relationship between culture and perception of the pandemic, from the individual level to the national level, which warrants further studies from the cultural perspective (e.g., Yu et\u00a0al., 2021)."

To date, a few published commentaries have attempted to describe the role of culture on public stigma during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as discriminating against or blaming a specific cultural group (e.g., Biswas et\u00a0al., 2021; Bruns et\u00a0al., 2020). While certain cultural groups are more vulnerable to social rejection during a pandemic, there is a gap about what are the prominent cultural determinants of the exhibition of stigma towards the \u201cculturally other\u201d. Moreover, as both culture and pandemic stigma are complex and multifaceted constructs, measures of these constructs are not consistent in the existing literature. A systematic review is ideal for synthesizing findings through an operationalized definition of these constructs to summarize how culture may influence stigma, with culture as the major theme or independent variable, and pandemic stigma (both self-stigma and public stigma) as the outcome or dependent variable. This type of review is needed to prevent or mitigate pandemic stigma in the future, by designing culturally responsive health campaigns and policies. Therefore, we conducted a systematic\nreview that aimed to examine cultural factors associated with public stigma and self-stigma during VRI pandemics."

Others came from diverse regions in Europe (n = 3), Asia (n = 6), Australia (n = 1), and South Africa (n = 1). One study included 173 countries worldwide, with regional comparisons. Most studies were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 29), with the rest conducted during SARS (n = 1) or H1N1 (n = 1). Studies relied on quantitative (n = 17), qualitative (n = 10), and mixed (n = 4) methods. Most studies examined self-stigma (n = 26), while only seven examined public stigma (n = 7) as the outcome variable/s. Other details, including participants\u2019 characteristics and measurements, are presented in Table\u00a03.\n1 3\nCultural factors and\u00a0pandemic\u2011related public stigma\nFrom the seven studies that examined public stigma (e.g., discriminatory attitudes), four cultural factors were identified: Race or Ethnicity, Religious Identity, Collectivistic Values, and Residence in Non-Western Countries (see Table\u00a04).\n[Insert Table\u00a04: Cultural Factors Associated with Public Stigma during Pandemics].\nRace and ethnicity As shown in Table\u00a0 4, three studies found that being members of the majority race or ethnicity was associated with public stigma. In Wong and Sam\u2019s study (2011), ethnicity was associated with the extent to which participants endorsed stigmatizing attitudes during the H1N1 pandemic. They found that among Malaysians,\nMalays endorsed the highest public stigma in the domain of fear (such as being afraid of those from overseas or eating outside) compared to Chinese and Indians. A qualitative study by Schmidt et\u00a0al. (2020) also found that ethnic or racial identity was associated with public stigma towards other ethnicities during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereby some of the Blacks in South Africa believed COVID-19 to be a \u201cWhite-mans\u2019 disease\u201d or a disease for those in China or Italy. They believed that the disease only affected \u201c\u2026 upper-class people who travel a lot\u201d, \u201cit was for the White people\u201d or that \u201cit doesn\u2019t affect Black people, we have strong genes\u2026\u201d (Schmidt et\u00a0al., 2020, p.12). On the other hand, a study in China by Jiang et\u00a0al.

Overall, these studies demonstrated that racial and ethnic identities were associated with negative perceptions of others who were affiliated with the pandemic, especially those from other racial groups.\nReligious identity Two studies found different religious identities within a country were associated with differences in public stigma during the COVID-19. In Lebanon, those who identified as a Muslim or a Druze reported higher discriminatory attitudes towards those infected with COVID-19 compared to the Christians (Haddad et\u00a0al., 2021). A study in India by Islam et\u00a0al. (2021) found that while Hindus perceived Muslims to be responsible for the spread of the COVID-19, Muslims did not hold this perception towards the Hindus.\nCollectivistic values Findings from Ahuja et\u00a0 al. (2020) showed a positive relationship between collectivism and pandemic-related public stigma in India, where collectivism was defined as the extent to which family and society needs take importance over an individual\u2019s needs (Kim et\u00a0al., 2016). They found that the more the non-Muslim participants endorsed collectivist values, the more they expressed public stigma (blaming and attributing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic) towards Muslims in India.\nNon\u2011Western countries A global survey conducted by Dye et\u00a0al. (2020) across 173 countries found differences in\nCOVID-19 related public stigma across different geographical regions. In comparison to participants from Europe, Northern America, or Oceania, participants from Non-western countries such as Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Caribbean regions were more likely to believe that individuals in their community had a negative perception of those who were infected or associated with COVID-19. They were also more likely to believe that people lost status and respect in the community when they tested COVID-19 positive compared to participants in Europe, Northern America, or Oceania. However, Dye and colleagues (2020) did not explain why there were differences across the regions."

And we\u2019re the ones that are spreading it around.\u201d (Pakistan, Female, 22, p.146) \u201cI think there\u2019s also a sense of stigma in the Somali community, when it comes to illness and diseases, people don\u2019t want to be seen as weak or vulnerable. So, I think there\u2019s also that mentality of just firming it and hoping for the best, and not wanting to be seen as suffering from COVID-19.\u201d (Somali, Male, 27, p.146) Vandrevala et\u00a0al.

The students mostly attributed the self-stigma to their ethnicity of being Chinese. Moreover, some of the students felt stigmatized or received less support by fellow Chinese nationals back in China as they were blamed for encountering stigmatizing responses by leaving China and being in the US \u201cThe only thing special is that we are all Chinese, and we were all wearing masks.\u201d (Male, 20, Chinese in the US, p.5) \u201cTheir [friends in China] attitude to me is why you chose to be in the USA [you asked for it]\u201d (Female, 24, Chinese in the US, p.6) Ji and Chen (2022)\n1 3\nTable 5 (continued)\nThemes Extracted Findings Authors (year)\nIn the US, Blacks and Latinx students recounted discriminatory behaviours towards them during the COVID-19 pandemic due to their race while the White students\u2019 recount of negative experiences included more of day-to-day life interruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic \u201cif you\u2019re a person of colour, I\u2019m pretty sure that you\u2019ve felt it. It\u2019s an unspoken thing to definitely feel it.\u201d (Black, 23, p.9) Tan and Umamaheswar (2021)\nChinese American adolescents who identified most as Chinese and lowest as American (separated profile) reported highest levels of being racial discriminated during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to those who participated in both Chinese and American culture (bicultural profile) as well as those who had low levels of participation in both cultures (marginalized profile). However, all three profiles did not significantly differ on reporting levels of feeling vicarious discrimination Zong et\u00a0al. (2021)\n2. Religious Identity (especially the minority) During the COVID-19 pandemic, significant differences in perceived self-stigma was reported in Canada across religions according to prevalence rate:\n\u2018Other\u2019 religion > Islam > Christianism > Atheism > Judaism\nMiconi et\u00a0al. (2021a)\nA participant in South Asia reported feeling stigmatized during the COVID-19 pandemic for being a Muslim \u201cAs I belong to a particular religion, the people near my home keep on bullying us for the coronavirus, which is not fair\u201d (Moslem participant in South Asia, male, in his 20\u00a0s) (p.10) Dye et\u00a0al. (2020)\nIn Israel, about a third of participants from cultural minority group, Ultra-orthodox Jews reported experiencing microaggressions during the COVID-19 pandemic due to their religious identity Weiden et\u00a0al. (2021)\nIn Lebanon, Muslims were associated with higher self-stigma (e.g., feeling isolated by others, internalized shame of being COVID-19 positive) compared to Christians among those who have tested COVID-19 positive Haddad et\u00a0al. (2021)\n3. Language as a Minority During the COVID-19 pandemic, significant differences in self-stigma prevalence was reported among different spoken languages groups in Canada, in the following order:\nEnglish-speaking cultural group > Bilingual (English & French) > French-speaking group\nMiconi et\u00a0al. (2021a)\n4. Cultural Values Conflict with the Dominant Society A few Chinese students reported being stigmatized due to wearing masks during the COVID-19 pandemic and attributed it to differences in cultural values and norms\n\u201cAmerican culture values human rights and freedom. The American people do not listen to their government, even if their government asks them to do something. Chinese people tend to listen.\u201d (p.14) \u201c\u2026values personal freedom more than anything else\u2026 This is what Americans looks like to me\u2026they live a very independent and individualistic life\u2026\u201d (pp.14\u201315)\nMa and Zhan (2020)\n1 3\n(N = 23). In North America (the USA and Canada), several studies found that Asians reported the highest degree of being stigmatized or discriminated against during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to other races, especially Whites (Inman et\u00a0al., 2021; Miconi et\u00a0al., 2021a, 2021b; Pan et\u00a0al., 2021) and other People of Color (POC), such as Blacks or Latino/a (Molock & Parchem, 2021), or Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (Park et\u00a0al., 2022). Generally, in the US, Asians were seen to experience higher self-stigma compared to non-Asians during the COVID-19 pandemic (Kim et\u00a0al., 2022). Moreover, some Asians attributed self-stigma to their ethnicity or race. Dye et\u00a0al. (2020) reported that across 173 countries Asian and Chinese participants felt stigmatized during the COVID-19 pandemic due to their ethnicity. For instance, a Southeast Asian participant in Europe stated, \u201cI am Asian\u2026people treated me badly and avoided me.\u201d (Dye et\u00a0al., 2020, p.10). Similar findings were echoed among Chinese or Asians in France, and the US, whereby their Asian physical appearance, as well as China being the pandemic origin, were some of the reasons for feeling stigmatized and being discriminated against during the COVID-19 pandemic (Ji & Chen, 2022; Oh & Min, 2022; Wang et\u00a0al., 2021). Interestingly, Ji and Chen (2022) indicated that the Chinese international students not only felt stigmatized by the majority in the US, but also felt blamed and received less support from the Chinese back in China, as they were told it was their own choice and responsibility for leaving China and studying in the US.\nMoreover, self-stigma during the pandemic was not limited to Asians per se, as other ethnic minorities also reported higher experiences of discrimination compared to the majority in the USA (e.g., Le et\u00a0al., 2022, Shah et\u00a0al., 2021, Strassle et\u00a0al., 2022, & Tan & Umamaheswar, 2021). For instance, ethnic minorities such as Blacks and South Asians in the USA reported similar narratives where they felt that they were stigmatized by the public and the community around them such as, \u201cI think somehow there\u2019s always this narrative that we\u2019re the other\u2026We have COVID, and nobody else seems to have it. And we\u2019re the ones that are spreading it around.\u201d (Vandrevala et\u00a0al., 2022, p.146). Interestingly, not only were particular racial labels associated with intensified self-stigma, but personal identification with the racial label was found to be associated with a higher level of self-stigma. For instance, Zong et\u00a0al. (2021) found that\nthose Chinese American adolescents who identified themselves most as \u201cChinese\u201d (participation in Chinese culture) and lowest as \u201cAmerican\u201d reported the highest level of racial discrimination experiences, compared to their counterparts who identified either as bicultural or had a low level of identification with both cultures. Increased self-stigma among ethnic minorities was not limited to COVID-19 pandemic, as an earlier qualitative study during SARS also found that residents of the Chinatown in New York, USA reported feeling stigmatized due to their ethnicity (Eichelberger, 2007), such as a participant stated: \u201cI did feel more self-conscious that I was getting these looks because I was\u2014I am Asian, Asian\u2013American. That was hard for me.\u201d (p. 1290). In short, the studies showed that ethnic identity, especially being the minority, was associated with higher self-stigma during a pandemic.\nReligious identity, especially among the minorities Three studies found that minority religious groups were stigmatized during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in Quebec, Canada, individuals who self-reported as \u201cother\u201d religion reported the highest discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic, followed closely by Islam and then Christianity, Atheism, and Judaism (Miconi et\u00a0al., 2021a). Moreover, in Dye and colleagues\u2019 (2020) study, a Muslim participant wrote that they felt stigmatized in a South Asian country, \u201cAs I belong to a particular religion [Islam], the people near my home keep on bullying us for the coronavirus, which is not fair\u201d (Dye et\u00a0al., 2020, p.10). Weiden et\u00a0al. (2021) found that a third of the participants from the cultural minority group in Israel, Ultra-orthodox Jews, perceived they experienced microaggressions due to their religious identity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interestingly, Haddad et\u00a0al. (2021) found that Muslims in Lebanon (the majority) who were diagnosed with COVID-19 were more likely to report feeling isolated by others or having higher internalized shame concerning their condition compared to Christians who were diagnosed.\nBeing a minority by spoken language Self-stigma was not only associated with religious minorities but also with those who were a minority by spoken language. In the same study conducted in Quebec, Canada, Miconi et\u00a0al. (2021a) found that those who were English-speaking were more likely to\nTable 5 (continued)\nThemes Extracted Findings Authors (year)\n5. Countries and Regions Participants from Africa, Asia, Northern America, and Oceania reported a higher frequency of self-stigma (experiences of bullying, harassment, and hurt) compared to those in Latin America & Europe during the COVID-19 pandemic Dye et\u00a0al. (2020)\n1 3\nreport experiences of discrimination during COVID-19 compared to those who were bilingual (English and French) or French-speaking only. As Quebec is a French dominant region, this implies that those who could not speak the French language (most likely a foreigner) faced higher selfstigma than others during the pandemic.\nCultural values conflict with the dominant society A qualitative study by Ma and Zhan (2020) found that a mismatch in cultural values was associated with stigma experiences. They interviewed Chinese international students who felt stigmatized by Americans in the USA. Chinese students reported that they were being stigmatized due to the mismatch in cultural values and norms between the Chinese and mainstream American society, which resulted in differences in health behaviors and beliefs during the pandemic. For instance, an interviewee mentioned, \u201cAmerican culture values human rights and freedom. The American people do not listen to their government, even if their government asks them to do something. Chinese people tend to listen.\u201d and another, \u201c\u2026Americans look\u2026to me\u2026they live a very independent and individualistic life\u2026\u201d (Ma & Zhan, 2020, p.14). Another participant quoted their American Professor\u2019s judgment of them for wearing masks, \u201cWhy are you wearing masks? You are selfish. You should leave the masks to doctors\u201d (Ma & Zhan, 2020, p.11).\nCountries and regions Finally, one study found that selfreported discrimination differed among countries. Countries from African, Asian, Northern American, and Oceania regions reported higher experiences of self-stigma, represented by COVID-19 related bullying/discrimination, compared to those in Latin America and Europe (Dye et\u00a0al., 2020)."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "The current systematic review identified a number of cultural factors associated with public stigma and self-stigma during pandemics caused by VRI. Previous researchers have highlighted that stigma is a complex and multi-faceted phenomenon, with factors influencing stigma at different levels, including culture (e.g., Link & Phelan, 2001). Erez and Gati (2004) illustrated the intersection of a multi-level culture model from individual level to group, organizational, national to global levels. However, there has been no integrative model of how culture at different levels interact with stigma specifically. Hence, based on our findings, we attempted to construct the cultural factors we identified into a multi-level systemic model of cultural levels relevant to pandemic stigma. This consisted of culture from the micro-individual domain, meso-level shared cultural group\nidentity, and the larger macro-society/ecology one resides in. The micro domain describes the influence of culture at the individual level, such as cultural values or beliefs. Next, at the meso-level of shared identity, we identified cultural group identities such as race/ethnicity, religion, or shared language, which influenced pandemic stigma. Lastly, the influence of culture at the regional or country level was mapped onto the macro-level domain, termed cultural ecology. We label this model tentatively as a \u201csystemic cultural stigma model\u201d (see Fig.\u00a02).\nHere, we discuss this cultural stigma model in relation to both public stigma and self-stigma during the pandemic from the perspective of evolutionary cognition from Strong Ties Weak Ties (STWT) cultural rationality theory (Sundararajan, 2020; Yeh et\u00a0al., 2022) and social group conflicts from scapegoating theory (Allport, 1954). Then, we discuss the implications of our findings for community healthcare."

            "text": "As shown in the systemic cultural stigma model in Fig.\u00a02, collectivistic values (individual level), ethnic/racial and religious identity (shared cultural identity), and non-western countries (cultural ecology) were associated with pandemicrelated public stigma. These cultural factors could be interpreted through cultural niche-rationality theory, recently proposed by Sundararajan \u2018s (2020). Cultural rationality theory posits how individuals differ in their cognition, such as reasoning about the world based on their evolutionary ecology, which influences the subsequent choice of survival behaviors (Morfett, 2018; Sundararajan, 2020). A StrongTies based community is described as comprised of closeknit relationships of family or kinship, with a cognitive orientation to external cues and resources (i.e., relying on strong-ties networks during hardship, shared responsibilities, and decision making), whereas weak-ties networks refer to distant relationship networks, such as acquaintances or strangers (Sundararajan, 2020; Ting & Sundararajan, 2018). With this foundation, STWT cultural rationality theory posits that an individual with a more dominant strong-ties rationality is more holistic in their cognitive style, where they perceive self in relation to those around them, aligning with the concept of related others (Sundararajan, 2020). Hence, in strong-ties dominant societies, individuals prioritize safety and wellness of family, kinship, and close friends, with fewer considerations given to those perceived as threats (regardless of in-group out-group membership), which could result in the social rejection of the latter. Values such as collectivism are privileged among strong-ties dominant societies, while individualism is privileged among weak-ties dominant societies (Sundararajan & Yeh, 2021). Research has also identified some associations between certain religions\n1 3\nor ethnicities that historically embody kinship and bloodline as important and their members being more dominant in strong-ties rationality (Thong et\u00a0al., 2022; Ting & Zhang, 2021; Yeh et\u00a0al., 2022).\nPublic stigma, especially in the context of infectious diseases, has previously been explained through evolutionary needs, with its function to preserve group survival by distancing from those who are perceived as threats, namely the out-groups (Gilmore & Somerville, 1994; Kurzban & Leary, 2001; Saeed et\u00a0al., 2020). During disasters such as pandemics, a society becomes tighter in its social norms, expecting higher conformity from its members, due to the commonly perceived threat of a contagious virus (Gelfand et\u00a0al., 2021). STWT cultural rationality theory (Sundararajan, 2020) further suggests this type of reasoning is more privileged by strong-ties societies, following the evolutionary discourse, where tribal survival needs are prioritized over individual survival.\nWe found that the cultural factors associated with public stigma represented characteristics of strong-ties rationality at the micro-level through to strong-ties society at the macro-level. At the individual level, one study showed an association between collectivistic values and public stigma (Ahuja et\u00a0al., 2020). At the group identity level, strong-ties ethnic identity was seen to have led to the social rejection of others who were more susceptible to the virus (Jiang, et\u00a0al., 2021; Schmidt et\u00a0al., 2020). In addition, we also found that religious groups in strong-ties societies were associated with higher public stigma toward the perceived threat, COVID-19\ninfected or affiliated persons (Haddad et\u00a0al., 2021; Islam et\u00a0al., 2021). Lastly, at the cultural ecology level, a study found higher public stigma among strong-ties countries, such as in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean regions compared to the weak-ties countries such as Europe, Northern America, or Oceania (Dye et\u00a0al., 2020). The former regions have historically been considered as collectivistic societies in previous cross-cultural psychology literatures (Eaton & Louw, 2000; Holloway, 1990; Triandis, 2015). Past literature (e.g., Krendl & Pescosolido, 2020) on mental illness stigma has also corroborated our findings demonstrating a higher endorsement of stigma in Eastern countries (strong-ties characteristics) even towards their own in-group members due to the perceived threat to their group dynamics compared to Western countries (weak-ties characteristics). Overall, evolutionary cognition and niche could well explain why these strong-ties related cultural features are associated with public stigma, due to their association with the conservation of bloodline and in-group survival."

            "text": "As shown in our cultural stigma model, having conflicting or mismatching cultural values with the dominant society (individual level), or being a minority by ethnicity, religion, or language (shared cultural identity), or particular countries (cultural ecology) were cultural factors associated with pandemic-related self-stigma. We propose this pattern of self-stigma being perceived primarily among the minorities\n1 3\ncould be explained using scapegoating theory (e.g., Allport, 1954; Sullivan et\u00a0al., 2014). According to Allport (1954), during social turbulence, \u201cscapegoating\u201d occurs as people displace their anger and frustration on those perceived as being minority group members, usually based on common cultural labels such as ethnicity or religion. Sullivan et\u00a0al. (2014) further posited that the mechanism of displacing blame on tangible and controllable targets when situations are perceived as out of control (e.g., a crisis) brings a temporary sense of control to those of the majority. Hence, during a disastrous pandemic, this could result in minority cultural groups being the scapegoats, subject to selfstigma. We found that the majority of the articles in our review pointed to Chinese or Asian Americans as the ethnic minority group who felt most stigmatized or discriminated against during the pandemic due to their behavior of wearing a mask (Ma & Zhan, 2020), their physical appearance, or their affiliation with countries in the Asian region where the pandemic was believed to have originated (e.g., Dye et\u00a0al., 2020; Eichelberger, 2007; Miconi et\u00a0al., 2021a, b; Molock & Parchem, 2021; Oh & Min, 2022). Moreover, other ethnic minorities, such as Persons of Color in the US, also reported higher self-stigma, potentially as the result of scapegoating (e.g., Le et\u00a0al. 2022; Tan & Umamaheswar, 2021). Other forms of cultural identity were also associated with higher self-stigma and discrimination during the pandemic, such as those who were members of a minority by religion or spoken language (Miconi et\u00a0al., 2021a, b; Weiden et\u00a0al., 2021). Especially in the context of religion, both dominant and non-dominant religious groups reported higher self-stigma (e.g., Haddad et\u00a0al., 2021, Islam et\u00a0al., 2021), suggesting religious identity is susceptible to selfstigma during a pandemic regardless of their social status. Lastly, in the larger ecology domain, one study found differences in the level of self-stigma across countries in different regions (Dye et\u00a0al., 2020)."

Despite the need for more research in certain cultural domains, our proposed model may guide the design of public health interventions during the recovery stage of the pandemic. We suggest national policies should consider culturally-responsive approaches to increase the effectiveness of anti-stigma campaigns in the community. For instance, in strong-ties societies, policymakers could reframe anti-stigma interventions as \u201ccommunal thriving\u201d, which promotes the idea of \u201ctogetherness\u201d. To overcome disproportionate fear and perceived threat of marginalized groups, government agencies and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) could emphasize messages\nand awareness campaigns on practical and tangible methods of keeping safe as a whole community regardless of group membership during the pandemic for the larger good (e.g., \u201cWe are all one family\u201d or \u201cWe are all in the same boat\u201d). On the other hand, since cultural minority groups in general perceived higher self-stigma, national bodies such as the health ministry through national policies or media could advocate for their pandemic control campaigns to be more culturally responsive towards less-represented groups (e.g., ethnic minorities, migrant workers, refugees). Moreover, during future pandemics, healthcare providers (e.g., public health officials, mental health professionals) could focus on increasing awareness of the scapegoating phenomena, introducing cross-cultural empathy exercises, and increasing the internal locus of control within individuals in the weak-ties society, to help reduce displaced anger and frustration toward minority groups. Overall, with more culturally responsive health campaigns, we anticipate a better quality of life at the individual level, as well as positive communitywide benefits, with fewer instances of isolation and division within the society."

            "text": "Our review highlighted that there is limited rigorous and empirical literature exploring the role of culture in pandemic-related stigma. While differences in cultural characteristics such as ethnocultural identity associated with public stigma or self-stigma were reported, cultural theories explaining those observed differences were absent. In addition, the majority of the reviewed articles only used self-reported cultural characteristics. There is a need for researchers to also use cultural scales to assess participants\u2019 underlying cultural values (e.g., collectivism/individualism), rationality (i.e., STWT), thinking styles, etc. Moreover, the self-reported cultural characteristics, such as ethnicities, were compared with unequal sample sizes which, while reflective of the population in those countries, may limit the power of the analyses. As the current review led to our proposed cultural stigma model (see Fig.\u00a02), we recommend that future studies consider assessing all three domains to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the role of culture. Specifically, more studies could involve cultural measures in both the individual and ecology domains, to examine the dynamic interaction between the different cultural domains. There were also limited studies examining public stigma, as the majority studied only self-stigma during the pandemic. Understanding both constructs of stigma is important, as the systematic review showed that the cultural factors associated with each differed. Furthermore, there were multiple stigma scales adopted in the different studies, which only tapped into certain aspects of stigma, such as fear (e.g., Wong &\n1 3\nSam, 2011) or discriminatory treatment (e.g., Dye et\u00a0al., 2020), making comparisons across studies difficult. Some scales were only validated in one single national sample. Hence, we also recommend either exploring stigma concepts that may be specific to a culture through a bottom-up approach, or developing and validating standardized pandemic stigma scales for future research that are suitable for cross-cultural comparisons."

Regarding the systemic cultural stigma model, there was only one study each that mapped onto the cultural values and ecology domain, due to the limited availability of empirical studies in these cultural domains relating to pandemic stigma. Lastly, as this study only reviewed cultural factors and their association to stigma, other possible contributing factors to stigma, such as sociodemographic variables (e.g., age, gender, SES, political affiliation) or personal variables (beliefs and motivation), have not been taken into consideration."

We examined the intersectionality of three cultural domains, individual cultural values, cultural identity, and cultural ecology, and incorporated STWT cultural rationality theory and scapegoating theory, to draw on both evolutionary and sociological perspectives to explain how culture may affect pandemic stigma. We also highlighted the need for more mixed-method research in non-Western societies to look at both types of stigma. Finally, we advocate that it is essential to promote culturallyresponsive stigma interventions in the community, informed by research, to increase the well-being and inclusivity of minority groups during a pandemic.\nAcknowledgements The authors acknowledge and thank the following research assistants (Esther Ong, Jia Yee Choo, Keerthi Rajesh, Ling Yin Chan, Min Jun Choong, Darlene Koh Mei-Yi) from Monash Culture and Health Lab for their contribution during the abstract and full-text screening of the articles.\nAuthors contribution The authors confirm contribution to the paper as follows: Systematic\u00a0review\u00a0conception and design: May Kyi Zay Hta, Rachel Sing-Kiat Ting; Abstract screening: May Kyi Zay Hta, Qian Hui\nGan; Full-Text Screening: May Kyi Zay Hta, Qian Hui Gan, Rachel SingKiat Ting, Pei Hwa Goh; Critical appraisal: May Kyi Zay Hta, Pei Hwa Goh, Rachel Sing-Kiat Ting; Analysis and interpretation through consensual approach: May Kyi Zay Hta, Rachel Sing-Kiat Ting, Liz Jones, Pei Hwa Goh, Qian Hui Gan; Manuscript writing and editing: May Kyi Zay Hta, Rachel Sing-Kiat Ting, Liz Jones, Pei Hwa Goh, Qian Hui Gan.
