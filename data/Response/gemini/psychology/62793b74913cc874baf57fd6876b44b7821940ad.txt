1. **Investigate the effect of different magnetic field strengths on the adsorption efficiency of the magnetogel.** The current study used a magnetic field strength of 1.42–1.47 T. It would be interesting to investigate how the adsorption efficiency of the magnetogel changes with different magnetic field strengths. This could help to optimize the magnetic field strength for the removal of specific pollutants.


2. **Explore the use of different types of magnetic nanoparticles in the magnetogel.** The current study used γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles. However, other types of magnetic nanoparticles, such as magnetite (Fe3O4) or cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4), could also be used. It would be interesting to investigate how the type of magnetic nanoparticle affects the adsorption efficiency of the magnetogel.


3. **Study the adsorption mechanism of the magnetogel in more detail.** The current study provides some insights into the adsorption mechanism of the magnetogel. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the detailed mechanism. This could be done using techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).


4. **Investigate the reusability of the magnetogel.** The current study did not investigate the reusability of the magnetogel. It would be important to investigate how many times the magnetogel can be reused without losing its adsorption efficiency. This would be a key factor in determining the practical applicability of the magnetogel.


5. **Apply the magnetogel to the removal of other pollutants.** The current study investigated the removal of Co(II), Ni(II), and Cr(III) from water. However, the magnetogel could also be used to remove other pollutants, such as heavy metals, dyes, and organic pollutants. It would be interesting to investigate the removal efficiency of the magnetogel for a wider range of pollutants.
