    "abstractText": "Long-wire very low frequency antennas, when lifted up on high altitudes by an aerostat, move through different atmospheric layers and interact with them electrically in a more intense way in comparison with aircraft flights. Such interactions manifest themselves in the form of electrical changes in the clouds and corona discharges excited on the antenna wire, which may increase the risk of mechanical damages and transmitter overload. In order to investigate the interactions between the different types of clouds and a long balloon-borne antenna wire, two theoretical models were developed and compared with results from an experimental balloon flight directly through a storm front. Based on the theoretical and experimental results, the most accurate model proposed was chosen, as well as a set of basic requirements for the balloon-borne VLF antenna system, reducing the risk of failure during operation in highly electrically active atmospheric environments.",

            "text": "Very low radio frequencies (VLF, 3\u201330 kHz) have been used since the 1920s for longrange stable telegraphic communication, transmission of time- and frequency standards, and communicating with submerged submarines and mines. Antenna systems required to efficiently emit signals in these frequency range are, for mechanical and maintenance reasons, often reduced to multiple tuned mast-antenna systems with capacitive overhead wire nets [1]. The overall linear dimensions of the radiating structures of these systems are designed to be as close as possible to the order of magnitude of the emitted wavelengths\u2014tens of kilometers. The elaborated mechanical structures pose significant costs of construction and periodic maintenance [2], which are difficult to handle if the designed system is to be employed occasionally, for scientific purposes, or as a support for existing stations. The actual sizes of the VLF antenna systems also make them easily traceable on satellite and radar data, which\u2014in addition to their strategic importance\u2014poses a threat of becoming an easy target for enemy activities. Solutions to reduce the costs and resources needed to establish a fully operating VLF antenna system are either supporting the ground-anchored radiating structure (wire) by an aerostat [3] or creating a fully airborne antenna system, lifted up to higher altitudes by an airplane or an aerostat [4,5]\u2014not only dismissing the requirement of large mechanical supporting structures on ground, but also\u2014if a stratospheric (reaching the altitude above ~12 km) balloon is employed\u2014moving the VLF transmitting system into an environment less accessible to conventional aircraft and weapons (low temperatures and low partial pressure of oxygen, impeding the engines\u2019 combustion processes), making it essentially unobtrusive and naturally protected. It shall also allow the use of such VLF transmitters for remote sensing of the atmosphere/clouds and ground layers, similarly to magnetic ferritecore loop antennas lifted up by helicopters [6]. In comparison with horizontal antennas trailed by conventional aircraft, balloon-borne systems also consume less resources (fuel\nSensors 2022, 22, 5302. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22145302 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 5302 2 of 28\nand maintenance costs), provide more stationary operation of the system with less risk from extensive mechanical loads due to flight dynamics, offer greater radiation efficiencies (the elongation of the radiator is not problematic), achieve wider signal coverages, and require less power for operation. Balloon-borne antenna systems move through the atmosphere with total velocities much lower than these of an airplane (as the latter, being an aerodyne, requires a high velocity to create the lifting forces), consuming less energy, and allowing the use of vertical linear antennas, providing an effective mean to emit a vertically polarized signal that possesses superior characteristics when exciting the terrestrial (ground\u2013ionosphere) waveguide [7,8]. Such systems, however, interact with the surrounding atmosphere differently than the horizontal aircraft-trailed wires, as the balloon-lifted vertical wires are not only subjected to different speeds of electric charge accumulation and loss, but also may act as a shunt between two differently charged regions of a cloud, the flight through which cannot be directly avoided (as the ground-bound balloon pilot\u2014used if a heavy balloon mission is flown\u2014cannot change the mission\u2019s trajectory, except for the remote forced initiation of the descent phase). All of these phenomena lead to the potential occurrence of intense corona and electrical discharges, which could damage the antenna itself, its coupling elements, and the transmitter [9]; additional requirements and constraints must be issued for the system in order to protect it from direct damage from electrical overloads and mechanical damages resulting from interactions with the atmospheric electricity. It is of great importance to investigate the electrical compatibility of such balloon missions\u2014this type of elaborated analysis often lacks in antenna design, and problems linked to electrostatic interactions of the craft materials with the atmosphere and clouds have already caused serious accidents in lighter-than-air aviation (e.g., the catastrophes of the LZ129 Hindenburg or the Star of Poland Stratostat [10]). Modern research [11\u201315] concentrates mainly on the electrification of the clouds themselves (including assumptions on the future/possible numerical models), electrification and discharges on plastics, and the occurrence and properties of lightning strikes on aircraft (natural, artificial, and model setups). The acquisition and loss of electric charge in aircraft was addressed in Reference [15]; however, no cloud-related mechanisms were presented, as the major focus was on the inception of lightning. An optional solution to assess the electric charge loss was based on the measurement of the lightnings\u2019 lengths, which required experimental optical data. As the experimental case considered in this paper is an atypical one (slow vertical metallic airborne setup with low velocities), new formulations must be created by using adapted basic formulas and then concatenated to give the first complex descriptions of these electrostatic interactions. In this paper, such interactions\u2014e.g., the increase of electric field strength around the large air-floating antenna\u2014are modeled by using two different models of interaction with clouds and their proximities; these models are then compared with direct corona and discharge data obtained from a rare case of a stratospheric flight directly through a warm storm front. Finally, a set of additional requirements and constraints is presented in order to protect the transmitting balloon-borne system from direct damage."

            "text": "The clouds, due to the processes of coagulation of water droplets which capture freefloating ions, experience a very low electrical resistance, lower than the air in good weather. The conductivity of the air increases with altitude, reaching the highest values in the ionosphere. The precipitation (rain) leaving the cloud possesses a positive charge shortly after exiting the cloud; later on, however, during the fall, the charge drops (gets mixed, positive and negative) due to electrostatic interactions between the individual droplets of different sizes and the surrounding air [17]. Due to the significant difference in electrical resistances between the cloud and the air in good weather, the charged particle/object loses its electric charge much faster in the latter conditions. This process is exponential and accelerates with the increase of altitude; the general function of this decrease from the particle\u2019s initial electric charge Q0 (C) can be formulated as follows:\nQloss = Q0e \u2212 1\u03c4loss t (1)\nwhere the time constant, \u03c4loss (s), corresponds to the time after which the electric charge of a particle decreases three times in the cloudless air [13]. This constant is a function of altitude H (m) and can be approximated for different altitude ranges by using the given formulas:\n\u03c4loss = 728.19e\u22125\u00b710 \u22124\u00b7H \u2227 0 m < H \u2264 2000 m (2)\n\u03c4loss = 535.5e\u22123\u00b710 \u22124\u00b7H \u2227 2000 m < H \u2264 4000 m (3)\n\u03c4loss = 360.8e\u22123\u00b710 \u22124\u00b7H \u2227 4000 m < H \u2264 6000 m (4)\n\u03c4loss = 272.1e\u22122\u00b710 \u22124\u00b7H \u2227 6000 m < H \u2264 8000 m (5)\nIn the presence of high electric fields and/or large electric charges, the loss of electric charge of an object may manifest itself in the form of corona\u2014short electrical discharges, not always accompanied by glowing ionization of the air, appearing rapidly with clear intervals. The electric field strength above which the corona appears\u2014the corona initiation field strength\u2014decreases exponentially with the altitude, following Paschen\u2019s law describing the breakdown voltage/electric field strength as a function of air pressure [18,19]; according to the research on electrostatic precipitators (industrial devices used to electrically separate different dust fractions by electrifying them), the corona is more easily initiated on wires of larger radii (larger surface) [20]\u2014this is consistent with the experiments on aircrafttrailed wires, which exhibited corona of increasing intensity with the increase of wire length [21]. Atmospheric experiments on the appearance of corona showed that, for higher altitudes\u2014lower air pressure\u2014the corona initiation field strength varies from 7.2 kV/cm for the altitude of 18,300 m to 4.6 kV/cm for 30,500 m; laboratory experiments with charged dielectrics (Mylar sheets) showed that the Paschen\u2019s law indicated the surface charge density of the charged object (surface charged density needed for the breakdown to occur) as one degree of magnitude higher than in the actual experiments [12]. For the airplanes, the loss of electric charge acquired via friction with the water and ice particles, as well as by the electrostatic induction, is facilitated by the affixation of special dischargers, consisting of an externally insulated short cable with a bundle of thin wires at the end [21]. The dischargers are affixed on the extremities of the aircraft (wing tips, winglets, and tips of the vertical and horizontal stabilizers), where the electric charge density is maximized, accelerating the charge loss (see Figure 1). As the aircraft moves with the average velocities of hundreds of km/h through electrically charged regions in the atmosphere, its presence in these regions is too short to actively influence the clouds\u2019 structures and evolution. Slowly moving balloon missions are subjected to slower acquisition of electric charge by friction with surrounding particles, but, due to the much longer presence in the clouds (due to slower movement), they may be considered to be a disturbance of the cloud\u2019s homogeneity, influencing its evolution and the surrounding electric field.\nSensors 2022, 22, 5302 4 of 28\nSensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 32\nwith the average velocities of hundreds of km/h through electrically charged regions in the atmosphere, its presence in these regions is too short to actively influence the clouds\u2019 structures and evolution.

(C) formulated as follows [13]:\nQmax. = 0.515\u03b50ELd (6)\nwhere \u03b50 \u2248 8.854 F/m is the electrical permittivity of vacuum, and E (V/m) is the external electric field intensity. This maximum value is reached exponentially in time, with the tim constant derived from the xperimentally defined charge accumulation rate, vC (in this analysis, equal to 0.3 \u00d7 10\u221213 C/m3/s [17], and 104 times more for the storm cloud conditions):\n\u03c4 = Qmax.

The electric potential distribution around the analyzed wire can be defined as follows [23]:\nV = Qmax. 4\u03c0\u03b50Ld log ( a + c a\u2212 c ) (9)\na = \u221a r2 + c2 (10)\nwhere c is the half of the wire\u2019s length (here equal to 70 m), and distance r is assumed at 1 m. In real conditions, the distance, r, is a variable dependent on the actual shape of the cloud and the position of the equipment in relation to the cloud\u2019s electric charge concentrations (if assumed that they could be considered as the \u20182nd electrodes\u2019). The exemplary experimental electric field strength data used in this comparison do not indicate any more information related to the geometry of the measuring equipment/environment (e.g., the distance between the probes), presenting the electric field strength values only. If the aforementioned assumption is maintained and a simulated (or experimental) cloud shape is delivered, a distance, r, could be introduced as a defined non-unitary value; however, this would limit the usefulness of the calculations, as the considered clouds present a lack of repeatability in this geometric scale (except their general types and substructures). Hence, the unitary value of the distance, r, was assumed. By using this formula, the electric field intensity, EI (V/m), around the electrified wire in this region can be derived:\nEI = 0.515E\n4\u03c0r\n( log\na + c a\u2212 c\n)( 1\u2212 e\u2212 bvC 0.515\u03b50E t + e\u2212 1 \u03c4loss t )\n(11)\nThe third zone\u2014the inside of the cloud\u2014can be characterized by an increased rate of electric charge accumulation and negligible charge loss; thus, Formula (8) is reformulated into the following [17]:\nQI I(t) = 3\u03b50ELd ( 1\u2212 e\u2212 bvC 3\u03b50E t )\n(12)\nresulting in the respective formula for the electric field strength, EII (V/m):\nEI I = 3E 4\u03c0r\n( log\na + c a\u2212 c\n)( 1\u2212 e\u2212 bvC 0.515\u03b50E t )\n(13)\nThe external electric field strength, E, can be taken directly from the experimental data shown in Figure 3; as these functions are altitude-dependent, to form such dependence in Formulas (12) and (13), the time, t (s), can be substituted with a ratio H/vZ, where H (m) is the altitude, and vZ (m/s) is the ascent rate of the balloon mission (chosen arbitrarily or based on the actual flight data). Additional elements of the electrification process of the balloon-borne wire are the electric charge acquisition during the takeoff procedure and the creation of potential difference during the freezing of remains of liquid water remaining on the system. As the wire antenna of the balloon mission is lifted up from the ground from a lying-down, already-deployed position, it remains in a rubbing contact with the partially conductive substrate (the airfield\u2014humid grassy surface). As the antenna rises, a difference of electric potential appears as an effect of the separation of charges between the wire and the ground [24]; assuming that the dielectric compound of the aluminum antenna (the supportive substrate of the wire) is partially composed of polyethylene, the maximum electric field strength resulting from this mechanism can be approximated as +300 V/m (lower than the mean value for different types of polyethylene due to expected irregularities in the process from the rugged airfield surface) [25]. In the mid-1940s, the works of Workman and Reynolds, as well as Gunn and Dinger, showed that, during the freezing process of water, an increase of the electric potential can be observed [26]; this process is able to produce electrical currents as high as 1 microampere and is experienced only during the freezing (does not manifest itself after the freezing\nSensors 2022, 22, 5302 8 of 28\nstops) [27]. In the current analysis, the freezing of possible water that remains accumulated on the antenna system may occur in the Ns clouds at the altitude of the 0 \u25e6C isotherm, around the altitude of 4.2 km from the data set in Figure 3. The maximum electric potential difference reached in this manner is +230 V (ice positive) [26,27]. The \u2018static electric field model\u2019 approach mentioned in the title of this section means that it is assumed here that the balloon mission does not interfere with the electrical structure of the clouds, thus allowing the use of encountered external electric field strength, E, in Formulas (11) and (13) (as presented in Figure 3). This does not necessarily correspond to the reality, as the balloon mission moves through the atmosphere with velocities low enough for it to be considered as a disturbance in the cloud\u2019s structure, which is theoretically able to modify its composition and the existing electric field (as mentioned in Section 2.1). Therefore, for comparative purposes, a \u2018dynamic electric field model\u2019 is proposed below."

            "text": "The basis for the definition of the possible influence of the slow-moving balloon mission with a long vertical antenna on the electric field in the cloud and its proximities is the assumption that, during the passage of the balloon mission, the cloud remains in a quasi-constant state, which can be described by the equation of cloud equilibrium [17]:\nEbelow cloud\u03bbbelow cloud = Ecloud\u03bbcloud = Eabove cloud\u03bbabove cloud (14)\nwhich describes the current densities (A/m2) in different electrified regions, with E (V/m) defined as previously, and \u03bb (S/m) as the conductivity of the given region. The three electrified regions\u2014below the cloud, inside the cloud, and above the cloud \u2014physically do not exist as a discontinuous formation; that is, the passage from one zone to another is smooth and continuous. Therefore, if discretized for different adjacent altitudes, H, the equation takes the following form:\nEH\u22121\u03bbH\u22121 = EH\u03bbH = EH+1\u03bbH+1 (15)\nIf the adjacent step\u2019s index is changed from H to a common i, E\u2032 is introduced as the value of the electric field strength modified by the presence of the antenna wire, and the index A is introduced as the one describing a parameter related to the antenna wire itself. Thus, Formula (15) can be expanded as follows:\n(Ei + EA)(\u03bbi + \u03b1\u03bbA) = E \u2032 i+1(\u03bbi+1 + \u03b1\u03bbA) (16)\nwhere \u03b1 (\u2013) is the ratio of the antenna wire volume to the volume surrounding it with the boundary of r = 1 m (similarly to the assumption in the previous section). The modified electric field strength, E\u2032, in the next (i + 1) step can be easily calculated from this formula; this value shall be then used in Formulas (11) and (13). The mode of employment of Formula (16) is recursive; that is, the antenna electric fields calculated from (11) and (13) become EA in the next calculation step (next altitude value), along with the respective Ei value from the cloud (Figure 3). The values of the conductivities in the clouds can be calculated by using the experimental electric field values and the current densities\u2014for the Ns clouds, under a macroscopic (large area) approach the current density reaches 10\u22127 A/m2; for the Sc clouds, assuming that the maximum conductivity may reach 1/25 of the conductivity of clear air (mean clear air value: 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221214 S/m [28]), the current densities in the central part of the Sc clouds reach values between 0.7 \u00d7 10\u221213 and 2.5 \u00d7 10\u221213 A/m2 [17]."

In all cases, the vZ (ascent velocity) was defined as 3 m/s (consistent with experimental flight readings); the parameters of the antenna wire are used as defined in Section 3 (L = 140 m). For comparative purposes, a calculation of results for two lengths of wires\u201410 and 500 m\u2014was also carried out. The calculated electric field strengths were summed with the external electric field strength in order to correspond to the worst-case scenario, where the total electric field strength may appear high enough to induce discharges.\nFigures 5\u201311 present the calculated total electric field strengths for \u2018static\u2019 and \u2018dynamic\u2019 cases; the functions correspond to the electric field strengths appearing in the moment the antenna passes through the air/cloud.\nIt can clearly be seen that the maximum values of the electric field strengths for all cases are significantly higher for the \u2018dynamic\u2019 cases, where the external electric field in the cloud and in cloud proximities is influenced by a long electrically charged object of different conductivity\u2014the cloud, to maintain its equilibrium according to general Formula (14), for a changing conductivity elevates the electric field strength in the region where the disturbance takes place, as in Formula (16). As the local differences in conductivities reach many degrees of magnitude (air/cloud vs. aluminum), the local electric field strengths are expected to locally increase significantly to compensate for this, according to the assumed aforementioned mechanisms; hence, there are large differences in the E values between the models. For the Sc clouds, the \u2018static\u2019 model of electrification presents electric field strengths rarely exceeding 0.5 kV/m, while for the \u2018dynamic\u2019 charging model, the values may reach up to 30 kV/m for both Sc and Ns clouds\u2014despite their significant differences in initial electric field strengths, as shown in Figure 3 (this shows that the main causes for the increase of electric charge and electric field strength are the charging mechanisms, not the external electric field itself). The \u2018dynamic\u2019 model shows that, for the increasing values of the electric field strength inside the Ns clouds, with the mechanisms of electrification and charge loss adapted to these conditions, the difference between the antenna E values and the cloud\u2019s E values starts to decrease; this effect may be accelerated by the initial course of the cloud\u2019s E function. For all cases, the electric field strength drops rapidly after the exit from the zone with external electric field in proximity to the cloud\u2014a result of the increased conductivity of the surrounding air. For the Ns clouds, an increase of the electric field strength can be seen after the exits from the cloud regions (above the upper cloud borderlines)\u2014the effects of changing electric charge accumulation mechanisms.

The electric charge loss, depicted as faster at higher altitudes and slower at lower altitudes, due to changing conductivity of the air, can be related to the reported higher occurrence of lightning strikes appearing at lower altitudes on the aircraft [9]\u2014as the aircraft is subjected to higher electric charges facilitating the formation of lightning. The model that is considered most correctly describing the actual antenna wire electrification processes when passing through the clouds and their proximities is the \u2018dynamic\u2019 model, as it includes the expected (at given velocities of the balloon mission) influence of the antenna on the cloud\u2019s electrical structure as a sort of an artificial disturbance. The \u2018static\u2019 model was built on simpler formulas which rely directly on the electrification processes in the clouds and the atmosphere, yet do not include the functioning of the cloud as a uniform, self-equalizing system\u2014this appears as a crucial assumption for modeling electrostatic interactions which do resemble those appearing in reality in maturing charged clouds. As both models did not possess an implemented breakdown/lightning-strike condition (this depends on the local structure of the cloud, which varies for every existing cloud), the model that showed the highest possibility of the occurrence of breakdowns is also the dynamic one, as in this model, only the electric field strength derivatives inside the clouds appear sufficiently large to sustain the rapid electrification after a possible discharge\u2014a widely reported property of a highly electrically active cloud [17], imperceptible in the static model. The dynamic model results may be compared to the experimental results, which concentrated on the monitoring of corona appearing on the balloon-borne wire antenna of the same dimensions as in the simulations, traveling directly through a warm storm front."

            "text": "The dynamic model of balloon-borne antenna electrification in every considered cloud case has produced a single maximum peak of electric field strength (global maximum). The experimental corona discharge plot shows multiple peaks instead of one, considering that the discharges occur at the maximum electric field strength\u2014this difference is the effect of the exemplary value of r = 1 m at which the calculations were performed (as there is no solid second electrode in real conditions). Multiple discharge peaks show that the corona threshold value for the electric field strength is reached more rapidly and more often\u2014an effect of the intense electrifying processes and, as the antenna is fully immersed in the charging medium with no separation/insulation, physically lower values of the maximum distance, r, between the antenna wire and surrounding charged humid air concentrations. The plotted electric field strengths for both models and all cloud cases depict the electric field strength reached around the antenna wire in the moment the wire passes through the cloud/space of certain properties; after the antenna moves up and forward, the electric field strength either drops down in time to its previous value or evolves with the conventional evolution processes with the cloud. It should be, therefore, theoretically possible to influence the formation and evolution of clouds (by affecting their electric fields) by inserting into them a slow-moving, highly conductive disturbance in the form of a long antenna wire. Based on the qualitative analysis of the corona discharge currents and total charge flows, it can be expected that, from the perspective of the cloud, the electrifying effects of the antenna wire on the cloud structure cannot be treated as negligible; in an extreme case, the cloud may try to maintain its equilibrium by ejecting a certain electric charge upward\u2014an ephemeral effect often known as the TLE (Transient Luminous Event), which is observed naturally only above highly electrified clouds. The calculation of the discharge currents from the recorded corona peaks can be performed accurately if a Pearson coil is employed as a receiving end of the recording system. This type of coil is, however, unadapted for light stratospheric balloon missions because of its small dimensions and very high density\u2014this, from the point of flight safety, automatically elevates the balloon mission class to heavy, which demands more elaborated navigation and in-flight control; moreover, the majority of the payload available is dedicated to the coil only. It has been reported that the corona discharges are excited on the entire length of the antenna wire [21]. Each discharge is a high-temperature phenomenon which does not leave\nSensors 2022, 22, 5302 27 of 28\nthe substrate material undamaged\u2014microcraters from the discharge entry/exit points are able to mechanically weaken the material, facilitating the propagation of cracks during the mechanical strains in the re-entry phase\u2014this is most likely one of the contributing factors to the fact that the experimental antenna wire, subjected to intense corona in the storm cloud, landed with its aluminum part separated into pieces. As the entire wire is subjected to corona, the electric charge lost in each corona peak comes from the entire conductive part of the wire\u2014these current peaks pass also through the antenna transformer, creating high-voltage peaks endangering the transmitter\u2014especially if it is based on highvoltage-sensitive MOSFET transistors. Therefore, a set of protective measures must be undertaken to ensure the safe operation of the transmitter. The most intuitive way is to disconnect the transmitter from the antenna and operate it above the clouds only, and this, however, limits the research capabilities of such transmitting systems. Any ferrite snubbers provide sufficient protection only if employed as a part of a larger protective system, relying mainly on automatic overload detection [31]\u2014provided the total system is not too heavy and dense for a light-class balloon mission and not too payload-consuming for a heavier mission. A passive and effective system protecting the transmitter is the low efficiency of the antenna transformer, which can assure acceptable high-voltage risk levels for the semiconductor-based transmitter, but with lower transmitting efficiency\u2014to be overcome by either increased transmitter power or increased sensitivity of the receivers. The corona discharges, however, can be concentrated around mechanical structures which provide high electric charge density\u2014spikes, single wires, or wire bundles (similar to those shown in Figure 1), constituting an electrostatic discharger\u2014a safe location for rapid charge loss without the risk of mechanical damage to the antenna wire and, if the charge loss is continuous and rapid enough, low corona current peaks not endangering the transmitting circuit. An active solution for the reduction of the electric charge\u2014as in active inductive dischargers used in industrial applications [24]\u2014is unfeasible, as the system is a floating-earth conductor, with no permanent grounding."

            "text": "This paper presented two theoretical approaches to the description of the electrification of a long balloon-borne wire antenna traveling through different types of clouds. Based on the experimental flight through a storm cloud with intense corona discharges, the more accurate electrification model was chosen (the \u2018dynamic\u2019 one), with the differences between the model and the experiment indicated. The electrification models can be refined with more detailed formulas describing the electrification processes in various atmosphere layers for different antenna geometries. A set of basic requirements for the antenna system was defined in order to reduce the risk of transmitter overload and antenna damage due to ongoing corona. An open problem is the accurate theoretical modeling of the \u20182nd electrode\u2019 for atmospheric electrification processes and discharges; an engineering task would be to create a sufficiently lightweight and safe method for the discharge current measurements onboard a stratospheric balloon mission that is not based on a too-dense and too-heavy Pearson coil.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, T.A.M.; methodology, T.A.M.; validation, T.A.M.; investigation, T.A.M.; resources, T.A.M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, T.A.M.; supervision, J.M.
