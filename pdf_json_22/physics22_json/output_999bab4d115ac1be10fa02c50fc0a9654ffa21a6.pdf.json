    "abstractText": "Since its discovery, electrochromism, known as a modulation of the optical properties under an applied voltage, has attracted strong interest from the scientific community and has proved to be of significant utility in various applications. Although vanadium dioxide (VO2) has been a candidate of extensive research for its thermochromic properties, its intrinsic electrochromism has scarcely been reported so far. In this study, multi-electrochromism is described from VO2 thick films. Indeed, VO2 opaque film, doctor bladed from homemade monoclinic VO2 powder, shows a pronounced color modulation from orange to green and blue associated with an amorphization-recrystallization phenomenon upon cycling in lithium-based electrolyte. The strong memory effect allows to follow the coloration mechanism by combining various ex-situ and in-situ characterizations addressing both structural and electronic aspects. Upon cycling the multi-chromism of VO2 finds its origin in a transformation of VO2 into orange-V2O5 on oxidation while in reduction the blue color lithiated state illustrates a mixed vanadium oxidation state.",

            "text": "Electrochromism is a perceptible phenomenon in which a color change is observed as a response to a variation of electric potential 1-3. This process involves redox reaction and concerns a wide variety of materials 4. Electrochromic systems find applications in a variety of fields ranging from smart windows (transmission mode) 5 to displays (reflective mode) 6. With the continuous development of inorganic electrochromic materials, many transition metal oxides, such as WO3, NiO, TiO2, Nb2O5, MoO3 and their derivatives, have been studied7-11. Among them, vanadium oxides are of growing interest showing both anodic and cathodic electrochromism allowing a multi-color switch suitable for display. The vanadium element exists in several oxidation states, namely V3+, V4+, and V5+, leading to the formation of several oxides with exciting properties but until now mainly V2O5 has been recognized for its electrochromic performances 12-16.\nVanadium dioxide exists in different polymorphic forms, such as VO2(A), VO2(B), VO2(C), VO2(D), VO2(M), and VO2(R) 17-18. Among these polymorphs, VO2(M) is widely studied due to the metal\u2013semiconductor transition between VO2(M) and VO2(R) making it an attractive candidate for intelligent thermochromic windows or emissivity control for space applications 19. In this work, it will be shown that, next to its thermochromic performances, VO2 is characterized by unexpected electrochromic properties (color modulation between blue, green and orange) accompanied by structure change from VO2 (M1) to V2O5 under applied voltage,. To our knowledge, literature on EC properties of VO2 is scarce and reported in very few papers using transmittance data 20. In particular, aiming at combining thermochromism to electrochromism in a single material, Khan et al. attributed the modulation of transmittance in VO2 sputtered films cycled in lithium based electrolyte to the insertion reaction forming LixVO2. However, no structural information were provided.\nFollowing the same path of combining two chromogenic properties, namely thermochromism and electrochromism, in a single material, we re-investigate VO2 by choosing to work on opaque films suitable for displays and coatings for IR furtivity or thermal control applications. VO2(M1) powders were synthesized by polyol synthesis from ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) and ethylene glycol. Vanadium dioxide thick films deposited by doctor blading were cycled in lithium based ionic liquid and electrochromic performances in the visible region were systematically investigated. The strong memory effect, persistence of color while no potential is applied, in both the reduced and oxidized states allowed ex-situ characterizations combining several techniques, namely Grazing Incidence XRay Diffraction GIXRD, High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy HRTEM, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy XPS, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance EPR, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance NMR and Energy Electron Loss Spectroscopy EELS."

            "text": "Synthesis The synthesis of the VO2 (M1) phase was carried out using the polyol process mixing ammonium meta vanadate NH4VO3 to ethylene glycol (H6C2O2) as template, with a final treatment at 500 \u00b0C for 2 h under vacuum (PO2 \u2248 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 Pa) of the intermediate vanadylglycolate (VEG). Details of the synthesis and of the powders characterization are reported in our work published in the journal Inorganic Chemistry in 201721. VO2(M1) films were doctor bladed on In2O3:Sn/glass, ITO/glass. The film thickness, measured using a Dektak mechanical profilometer, was of about 1200 nm \u00b1 40 nm.\nElectrochromic measurements\nElectrochemical measurements were carried out in a three electrodes cell configuration using a BioLogic SP50 potentiostat/galvanostat apparatus, VO2 films on ITO/glass as working electrode, a platinum foil as the counter-electrode and Saturated Calomel Electrode, SCE (ESCE = 0.234 V/ENH as reference electrode ). All the electrochemical measurements were performed at room temperature in lithium-based electrolyte, namely lithium bis-trifluoromethanesulfonimide (LiTFSI, Solvionic, purity > 99.99%) in ethylimidazoliumbis-(trifluoromethane-sulfonyl)-imide (EMITFSI), in a voltage window of - 0.9 V and +1.9V with a scan rate of 20 mV/s. After application of specific potentials, VO2(M1) films diffuse reflectance spectra were ex situ recorded using a Varian Cary 5000 UV-VisNIR spectrophotometer. Colorimetric parameters in the CIE L*a*b* colorimetric space were deduced. The optical contrast (\u2206E*) between two color states was calculated using the equation: \u2206E* = [(L*1-L*2)2+(a*1-a*2)2+(b*1-b*2)2]1/2\nFilms characterizations The film structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (Philips PW 1820, PANalytical X\u2019Pert instrument, 2\u03b8 range from 8 to 60\u00b0 and \u03bbCuK\u03b11=1.54056 \u00c5). Grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering analyses, on films were carried out with a high-resolution diffractometer Bruker D8 Discover (films, grazing incidence, and textures), with Cu radiation. The adjustment of the grazing angles, namely 0.5, 1 and 2 degrees identified the 0.5 degree angle as the most suitable giving higher intensity.\nSurface composition of the films, and the variation of the oxidation number of the vanadium cations, in cycled films were deduced upon the electrochemical measurements, by ex-situ Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The VG ESCALAB 220i-XL apparatus allows an analysis of the 5 nm first nanometers in depth with a lateral resolution of 150 \u00b5m. A ThermoFisher Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer was used for surface XPS analysis of thin films. The monochromatized AlK\u03b1 source (h\u03bd=1486.6eV) was activated with a spot size 200 \u00b5m in diameter. The full spectra (0-1320 eV) were obtained with a constant pass energy of 200 eV and high-resolution spectra with a constant pass energy of 40 eV. High resolution XPS spectra were quantified and fitted using the AVANTAGE software provided by ThermoFisher Scientific.\nIn order to characterize the film composition and structure identification, the EELS combined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used. Scratched film mixed with ethanol was deposited on copper grids (200 mesh) coated with carbon formvar. Three calibration powders of homemade V2O5, VO2 and V2O3 were utilized. In order to stabilize the measurement, a cryogenic sample holder (GATAN) was used (at N2 liq. Temperature: -165 \u00b0C). Measurements were performed on highresolution (gun field emission) transmission electron microscope (HRMET) JEOL 2200FS, operated at 200 kV with a punctual resolution of 1.9 \u00c5, as well as an \u201cOmega\u201d in-column energy filter (GATAN) for EELS spectra with an energy resolution of 1 eV. The following conditions were chosen for the EELS spectra acquisition: illumination semi-angle \u03b1=1.4 mrad and collection semi-angle \u03b2=6.6 mrad, dispersion=60 \u00b5m/eV. The 0-loss was acquired in 0.02 s and the V-(L3-L2) / O-K were acquired in 3 s (energy shift of +550 e V). An average of 7 or 8 different locations were recorded for each sample leading to homogeneous results (for V-(L3-L2) and O-K edges).\nElectron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded at room temperature with a Bruker ESP300E spectrometer operating at X-Band frequency (9.54 GHz). The main parameters used to characterize the scratched films are the following: microwave power 10 mW, magnetic field modulation frequency and amplitude 100 kHz and 0.4 mT, respectively and a spectral resolution of 0.3 mT.\n7Li Solid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (SS-NMR) experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance III 300WB spectrometer (B0 = 7.1 T, Larmor frequency of 7Li: 116.6 MHz) equipped with a DVT BL2.5 magic-angle spinning (MAS) probe. The spectra were acquired using a Hahn echo (\u03c0 /2 - \u03c0) pulse sequence synchronized to one rotor period (MAS rate: 30 kHz) with a \u03c0 /2 pulse length of 2.0 \u00b5s and an optimized recycle delay of 1 s. A molar solution of LiCl (\u03b4(7Li) = 0 ppm) was used as external reference."

            "text": "Structural and morphological characterizations VO2(M1) powders were synthesized using the polyol process starting from a mixture of ammonium metavanadate and ethylene glycol forming a vanadyl glycolate VEG upon reaction. All the peaks of the X-ray patterns of the dark blue powders obtained by coprecipitation were indexed in the VEG phase (00- 049-2497 JCPDS data file; C2/c space group) (Figure 1a). The VEG powders were annealed under vacuum (2.10-5 Pa) for 2 h at 500 \u00b0C. After calcination (Figure 1b), the the narrowness of the peaks indicate an oxide with high crystallinity. The d-spacing values of all diffraction peaks match the ones of the monoclinic crystalline phase VO2 (Space Group: P21/c) with lattice constants a = 3.564 \u00c5, b = 11.510 \u00c5, and c = 4.373 \u00c5 (JCPDS # 85-0601).\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 1. X-ray diffraction patterns of the (a) as-synthesized VEG (b) VO2(M1) obtained at 500 \u00b0C post-treatment under vacuum (2.10-5 Pa) and (c) VO2(M1) films.\nFrom the as-synthesized VO2(M1) powders, micrometerthick electrochromic films (1.2 \u00b5m) were deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate using doctor blade technique. In first approximation, the XRD pattern of the as deposited opaque film shows similar features as the VO2 powder (Figure 1c). All the d-spacing values of the diffraction peaks (besides the ITO ones) match the ones of the monoclinic crystalline phase. Nonetheless, a preferential orientation along the (011) crystallographic direction of the VO2 (M1) film was evidenced indicating that the associated lamellar morphology may be favoured by the coating process22. Indeed, a drastic evolution of the morphology from powder to film is observed for VO2 (M1) from spherical powders to veil-shaped morphology (Figure 2). As expected, the deposition method plays a significant an role on the surface morphology of VO2 films 23,24.\nFigure 2. High-resolution images of VO2(M1) (a) powders, (b) film prepared by doctor blading, (c) and corresponding electron diffraction pattern (of b).\nFor the as-deposited film, the electron diffraction pattern (Figure 2c) clearly shows the presence of dark spots which can be indexed to VO2(M1) monoclinic phase according to the literature in good agreement with the XRD results.\nElectrochromic characterization\nThe electrochromic activity of VO2(M1) films was recorded in a lithium-based ionic liquid electrolyte. Figure 3a shows the 1st, 20th and 50th cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the VO2(M1) film deposited onto ITO and cycled, at a scan rate of 20 mV s\u22121 in the potential range of \u22120.9 to 1.9 V, in a three electrodes cell using ionic liquid based (0.3 M) LiTFSI in EMITFSI as a supporting electrolyte and Satured Calomel Electrode (SCE) as reference electrode. The CV shape clearly evolves upon cycling, both cathodic and anodic parts progressively becoming smoother and broader. Indeed, the first reductive scan shows two well defined peaks (at -0.2 V and -0.7 V), that progressively shift and broaden to merge into one large peak at about - 0.5 V after 50 cycles and the oxidative wave gradually extends to higher voltage upon cycling. Nonetheless, the cyclic voltammetry of VO2 films exhibit a good reversibility and stability in terms of capacity as illustrated by repetitive cycling, up to 500 cycles associated with no further evolution in the CV shape (Figure S1). In agreement with a nice reversible process, the charges deduced from the CVs in reduction and in oxidation are very close showing however a slight decrease upon cycling (Figure S2). Such reversibility, may be surprising as it concerns an irreversible process on early cycling thus probably illustrating a continuous and progressive transformation. The number of cycles required for a complete VO2 to V2O5 transformation still needs to be better evaluated. However, one can notice the similarity in CV shapes of the 50 and 500 cycles (Figure S1). Moreover, a pronounced colour change is observed upon cycling. During the reductive scan the initially dark green VO2 film turns green then blue and finally, after the (re)oxidation process, orange (Figure 3b). (c)\nFigure 3. (a) Evolution of the cyclic voltammograms (1, 20 and 50 cycles) of VO2(M1) film cycled in Pt/LiTFSIEMITFSI/VO2 vs SCE with a 10 mV/s scan rate, (b) visual appearance of the films in different color states and (c) Chronoamperograms at -0.9 V (reduced state) and +1.9 V (oxidized state) for 30 s.\nThe switching optical response in between alternating potentials is one of the most important characteristics of electrochromic materials and devices. The switching times, defined as the time required to reach 90% of the full response, were estimated to 5 and 7 s from chronoamperometry measurements performed at -0.9 V (reduced state) and +1.9 V (oxidized state) for 30 sec., respectively (Figure 3c). The response times, slightly higher in the reduction process (7 s) than in the oxidation one (5 s), are probably due to the transition from a more conductive to less conductive state, in agreement with the existence of various vanadium oxidation states in the reduced state.\nThe diffuse reflectance spectra of vanadium dioxide films for the oxidized and reduced states are illustrated in Figure 4a. The color switching between the blue-reduced and the orangeoxidized state corresponds to reflectance values of about 5% and 55% at 610 nm, respectively, leading to an optical reflectance modulation, \u0394R, of about 50%.\nFigure 4. (a) Ex-situ diffuse reflectance of VO2(M1) films in reduced blue state at (\u22120.9 V) and oxidized orange state (+1.9 V). Dashed lines represent the diffuse reflectance spectra recorded after three months storage under ambient air at room temperature (b) L*a*b parameters of VO2 in different colored states.\n(a)\n(b) -0.9V -0.3V +1.9V\n(b)\nThe coloration efficiency (CE), defined as the change in optical density (OD) per unit charge density (Q) was calculated from the following formula:\nCE = \u0394OD/Q eq (1) Where OD = log(Rox/Rred), Q the electrochemical capacity per unit area, Rox the reflectance at the oxidized state and Rred. the reflectance at the reduced state. The coloration efficiency is thus estimated to 56 cm2/C.\nThe L*a*b* parameters, extracted from the diffuse reflectance curve (not shown here) are illustrated in Figure 4b. The L*a*b* parameters are in good agreement with the visual colors. Indeed, for the blue-reduced state (at \u22120.9 V), the L*a*b* parameters are 19, \u221213, and -19, respectively, whereas for the orange-oxidized state (at 1.9 V), the L*a*b* parameters are 71, 27, and 41, respectively. Using eq(2), these values lead to a color contrast \u0394E* = 88.\n\u0394E* = [(\u0394L*)2 +(\u0394a*)2 +(\u0394b*)2]1/2 eq (2) Where \u0394L* =|L*2 \u2212 L*1|, \u0394a* = |a*2 \u2212 a*1| and \u0394b* = |b*2 \u2212 b*1|\nIn addition, Figure 4a shows the reflectance spectra of the oxidized and reduced states for films stored 3 months under ambient air at room temperature with no electrical voltage applied. In agreement with similar apparent colors and visual aspects, the reflectance curves for each color state are rather the same after three months, confirming the strong memory effect of the vanadium oxide films. Such property allowed us to investigate the electrochromic mechanism by performing ex-situ characterization of the films at various states using a combination of techniques."

            "text": "The mechanism at the origin of the multi-electrochromism in VO2(M1) relies both on structural and electronic evolutions. The Grazing Incidence X-Ray Scattering (GISAXS) pattern of the as-deposited film unambiguously corresponds to monoclinic VO2 (M1) (Space Group: P21/c) whereas the GISAXS patterns of the films recovered at the green and blue reduced states after 50 cycles exhibit mainly broad diffraction lines due to amorphous phases (Figure 5a and b). In oxidative regime (+1.9 V; Figure 5c), leading to an orange coloration, the peaks can be indexed as highly crystallized orthorhombic V2O5 (SG: Pmmn) with a pronounced orientation along the (001) crystallographic direction. Interestingly, such evolution was already reported for V2O3 films demonstrating, for both oxide stoichiometries, the trend to an irrevsrible transformation to the most thermodynamically stable V2O522.\nThe GISAXS results were combined with TEM. Figure 6 shows the morphology and the crystallites size for each colored state. As for the film before cycling (Figure 2b,c), the film reduced at -0.3V shows a veil-shaped morphology (Figure 6a). For the reduced blue state (-0.9V), a drastic change is observed with the appearance of agglomerated particles (Figure 6b). Furthermore, for the re-oxidized orange state (+ 1.9 V), the film appears homogenous with well-faceted particles (Figure 6c). This surprising morphological evolution is associated with structural changes as evidenced the electron diffraction pattern. For the reduced green state (-0.3V), the selected area electron diffraction SAED image still reveals the presence of some spots related to the VO2 monoclinic phase (Figure 6d). At -0.9 V, the reduced blue film is characterized by the presence of several spots characteristic of the V2O3 phase while the re-oxidized (+1.9V) orange film exhibits a SAED pattern characteristic of the V2O5 phase. At this stage, the identification of the blue state with the V2O3 phase remains unexpected as further discussed in respect of the electrochemical capacity value as well as the\noverall modification of the vanadium oxidation states using various characterizations.\nFurther insights in the structural evolution upon cycling were investigated by Solid-state NMR spectroscopy. 7Li and 51V MAS NMR experiments were conducted on scratched films recovered at different states (reduced at -0.3 V and -0.9 V and reoxidized at +1.9 V). As expected for both reduced films, strong interactions with paramagnetic V4+ ions prevent the observation of any 51V NMR signals, except for a very weak signal with isotropic shift \u03b4iso \u2248 - 590 ppm. The shape of the spinning sideband pattern suggests a large chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) (\u03b4\u03c3 \u2248 750 ppm and \u03b7\u03c3 \u2248 0.2) related to significant distortion of the vanadium site. Similar values of isotropic shifts and CSA parameters were reported for 51V MAS NMR signals observed for CeVO425 and various other vanadium oxides or oxysulfates26 where vanadium ions are located at distorted octahedral sites associated in V-O-V chains. However, the very low intensity of the 51V NMR signals observed for the reduced VO2 films (figure 7) and poor signal over noise ratio do not allow us to accurately determine the values of CSA and quadrupolar parameters (\u03b4\u03c3, \u03b7\u03c3, CQ, \u03b7Q) and then undoubtedly associated this resonance signal with some V5+ ions in isolated and distorted V-O-V chains25,26. On the contrary, the 51V NMR spectrum of the reoxidized film exhibits an\nintense and sharp signal (Figure 7b) characteristic of 51V in a well-crystalized V2O5 phase, in good agreement with the ex-situ grazing incidence XRD results (Figure 5).\nRegarding the Li+ ions environment within the reduced (lithiated) VO2 films, the 7Li NMR spectra (Figure 7a) show two main resonance lines at -0.8 ppm and -21.4 ppm consistent with those already reported in previous studies for chemically or electrochemically lithium intercalated LixV2O5 compounds 27-30.\nAsai et al. have shown that depending on the lithiation rate of amorphous LixV2O5, Li+ ions can actually occupy three different sites within the large cavity formed by eight VO5 square pyramids31. For the reduced VO2 films, the two observed 7Li NMR resonance lines can then be associated with Li ions at distinct locations within the vanadium oxide structure. Both signals are characterized by a short spin-lattice relaxation time (T1 < 100 ms), revealing magnetic interactions between the Li nuclear spins and the unpaired electronic spins of paramagnetic ions (V4+ or VO2+). The NMR signal with 7Li shift close to 0 ppm is attributed to Li ions located at octahedral sites similar to those occupied by Li in electrochemically intercalated LixV2O5 with x \u2264 132.The signal observed at about -21 ppm is actually the sum of two distinct resonance lines, as evidenced by NMR experiments performed at various MAS rates. The isotropic shift value and its variation with the MAS rate and then\nwith temperature (due to frictional heating of the rotor) suggests that the Li ions responsible for these resonance lines are close to paramagnetic centres (Fermi contact or pseudocontact interaction). Thus, several Li local environments were clearly evidenced by 7Li NMR. Moreover, the intensity of all 7Li NMR signals increases as the potential decreases from -0.3 V to - 0.9 V (Figure 7a), supporting the effective lithiation of the VO2 film. The 7Li NMR spectrum of the reoxidized (delithiated) film (recovered at +1.9 V) only shows a very weak signal in the structure (small irreversible capacity loss) or some electrolyte residue located at the film surface.\nAside from the structural modifications, redox reactions associated with the modulation of the vanadium oxidation states were evaluated by various techniques starting with XPS analysis. To identify the valence state, the binding energy of vanadium was determined. V2p3/2 core peak spectra were recorded for the as-deposited film and at specific potentials corresponding to distinct colorations (Figure 8): the green intermediate reduced state, the blue reduced state and the orange oxidized state, recorded after 50 cycles. In the potential range from +1.9 to \u22120.9 V, only two V2p3/2 core peaks are identified. The orange coloration being associated with the occurrence of a main peak near 517.3 eV assigned to V5+ ions. The second peak centered at 516.1 eV is ascribed to the V4+ ions. As expected, this contribution is predominant in the as-deposited film while V5+ ions are also present due to surface oxidation. The attribution of the 516.1 eV can be contested as this peak could be indeed the convolution of the characteristic signals of both V3+ and V4+ ions. The V5+/V4+ ratio shows that, whatever the coloration state, vanadium ions always have mixed 5+ and 4+ valence states. After 50 cycles, for a green color at -0.3 V, the V5+/ V4+ ratio is in favor of the V5+ ions with a significant minor peak of V4+ signal; this ratio is approximately around the unit, i.e. showing the same proportion of V5+ and V4+ ions, for the reduced blue state at -0.9 V. For the return sweep, in oxidative regime up to 1.9 V, leading to an orange color, the V5+ ions are at the origin of almost the entire XPS spectrum. The XPS results confirm the XRD study showing the re-oxidation to the stable V2O5 with orange color.\nThe variation of vanadium oxidation state upon cycling was also clearly evidenced by EPR measurements performed on scratched films at different states (reduced at -0.3 V and -0.9 V and reoxidized at +1.9 V). The EPR powder spectra (Figure 9)\nmainly exhibit an axial signal with g values g\u22a5 = 1.98 and g// = 1.91 associated with paramagnetic V4+ (3d1) or vanadyle (V = O)2+ cations33,34. This EPR signal clearly increases between -0.3 V and -0.9 V indicating the partial reduction of V5+ ions. Moreover, for the sample recovered at -0.3 V an additional signal is detected. This last signal, which is characterized by an hyperfine structure (marked by stars in Figure 9) due to unpaired electron spin interaction with the 51V nuclear spin (I = 7/2), reveals the presence of isolated (oxo)vanadium(IV) ions35,36. Upon reduction, the concentration in paramagnetic vanadium ions increases and no hyperfine structure is observed because of strong exchange interactions between the unpaired electron spins. After reoxidation (at +1.9 V), both EPR signals are still detected but their intensities are significantly reduced in good agreement with 51V NMR and XPS analyses showing that vanadium is mainly at the +5 oxidation state.\nEELS was also carried out to characterize the VO2 thick films at different colour states. Figure 10 presents the EELS spectra of the VO2 at reduced and oxidized states. In EELS characterization, V-L3 and V-L2 edges reflect the excitations from the V2p3/2 and V2p1/2 core levels to the unoccupied V3d states, while the O-K band is due to the excitation of the O1s electrons37-39. The difference in the oxidation state of vanadium atoms results in the chemical shifts of the V-L3, V-L2 and O1s edges. To obtain the insight into the extent of these shifts, the EELS spectra of standard compounds for V2O5, VO2 and V2O3 powders were first measured (Figure S4). Their comparison indicates the tendency of V-L3 and V-L2 absorption edge onset energies to increase with the increasing oxidation state of vanadium cations. Upon normalization to V-L3 absorption edge, it\nbecame evident that the relative V-L3/V-L2 intensity ratio decreased with the increase in oxidation state of vanadium (Figure 10). A characteristic feature is also the shape and intensity of O1s pre-edge, being much more intense for higher oxidation state of vanadium40. From literature, the shift \u0394E of the V-L3 edge relative to the O-K peak as measurement of oxidation state was chosen. \u0394E decreases from 13.8 eV (-0.9V), to 13.2 eV (- 0.3 V) and 12.2 eV (+1.9 V) in agreement with the presence of mixed states in reduced states and V5+ in oxidized ones.\nCONCLUSION\nElectrochromism starting from opaque VO2 greenish films is reported. Upon cycling in lithium based electrolyte, a progressive reversible switch from orange in oxidized state to blue in the reduced state takes place. The strong memory effect, associated with the persistence of the blue coloration in the reduced state allowed a careful characterization using techniques including Li and V NMR, XPS, leading to the conclusion of an initial and irreversible transformation to V2O5. The combination of the various techniques highlights the complexity of the mechanism based on the oxydo-reduction of the vanadium cations. This study represents an initial contribution to the understanding of the electrochromic mechanism taking place in vanadium oxide films giving rise to desirable multichromism and rather unique strong memory effect in oxides. As it was previously reported for V2O322, one can extend that whatever the initial oxide stoichiometry the trend is an irreversible transformation to the most thermodynamically stable V2O5 phase upon cycling.\nSupporting Information: \u201c500 Cyclic voltammograms (OPJ), cycling stability (OPJ), reflectance (OPJ) and EELS (OPJ) spectra of powders used as references\u201d\nAcknowledgements: The authors wish to thank Fran\u00e7ois Weill for fruitful HRTEM discussions.\nAuthor contributions: Issam Mjejri: conceptualization, characterization, writting.
