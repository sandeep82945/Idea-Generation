The bare interaction between the fermions is set to zero. A central question of our study is what type of interactions can be induced between the fermions by the bosons, for both weak and strong interspecies coupling. We find that the induced interactions can lead to competing instabilities favoring phase separation, superconducting phases, and density wave structures, in many cases at work on length scales of more than 100 sites. Marginal bosonic superfluids with a density matrix decaying faster than what is allowed for pure bosonic systems with on-site interactions, are also found.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.107.054502\nI. INTRODUCTION\nDue to their clean and fully controllable yet versatile setup, quantum gases in optical lattices have proven to represent an ideal candidate to realize a quantum simulator for classically incomputable many-body problems in condensed matter theory [1,2]. For monatomic bosonic gases trapped in a threedimensional (3D) optical lattice the theoretically predicted [3,4] quantum phase transition from a Mott insulator to a superfluid was experimentally proven to exist [5].\nThe interplay between bosons and fermions is ubiquitous in nature. In conventional superconductors phonons mediate an attractive interaction between the electrons. Mixtures of 3He and 4He caught attention already in the 1940s and showed such effects as a very low solubility and the Pomeranchuk effect [6\u20138]. Every Bose-Fermi system has, however, its own types of interactions and characteristics, and requires a separate study. In the field of ultracold atoms, several degenerate Bose-Fermi mixtures have been cooled to degeneracy over the past 20 years [9\u201317]. Induced interactions between the fermions mediated by the bosons leading to a fermionic pair superfluid attracted theoretical interest shortly after the first condensates were experimentally realized [18\u201321]. In more recent years, experimental efforts focused on the interactions between a bosonic and fermionic pair superfluid [22\u201325]. Experimental loading of a fermionic 40K and bosonic 87Rb mixture in an optical lattice [26] can lead to stronger localization and interaction effects such as phase separation, spin- or charge-density waves, and supersolids [27\u201343].\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. Further distribution of this work must maintain attribution to the author(s) and the published article\u2019s title, journal citation, and DOI.\nIn this work we examine the ground-state phase diagram of the one-dimensional Bose-Fermi-Hubbard model at unit filling for the scalar bosons and half filling for the S = 1/2 fermions. The bare fermions are taken to be free particles. As the system size and inverse temperature increase, the induced interactions grow stronger. Nevertheless, those induced interactions leading to pair flow [44] are expected to be weak for weak interspecies coupling [45]. In this Bardeen-CooperSchrieffer regime the pair size is very large, and therefore very large system sizes are required. For stronger interspecies coupling, localization effects are stronger and a competition between instabilities towards superfluids and density wave structures is expected. It turns out that the renormalization flow can still extend to hundreds of lattice sites, with misleading behavior on intermediate length scales. The purpose of this work is hence to map out the physics of induced interactions and competing instabilities for the one-dimensional Bose-Fermi-Hubbard model. It is one of the few sign-positive models for mixtures where unbiased numerical simulations can be carried out."

Those amplitudes are chosen equal and set as the energy unit, tB = tF = t = 1. We work at unit filling for the soft-core bosons and half filling for the hard-core bosons. The on-site density-density interactions are constant over the lattice. Its amplitude for the intraspecies soft-core bosonic interaction is U > 0, and the amplitude for the interspecies interactions is V , whose sign is irrelevant at half filling. There is no bare intraspecies interaction between the hard-core bosons. The lattice spacing is set to one, a = 1, and the length of the chain is L. The Jordan-Wigner transformation between hard-core bosons and fermions requires an odd number of fermions if we use periodic boundary conditions; we will use the language of bosons and fermions in this sense below. The model is simulated using a straightforward extension of the worm algorithm [46] presented in Refs. [47,48].\nThe parameters are chosen such that there is no apparent small parameter, i.e., in a regime where numerics are necessary. Contemporary density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) studies put a strong cutoff on the bosonic occupation number in order to keep the local Hilbert space tractable and focused on superfluid-insulator transitions [49\u201351]. Our main result is summarized in the phase diagram shown in Fig. 1, valid in the thermodynamic limit. However, monitoring the competing instabilities that develop on length scales consisting of hundreds of sites cannot be read off in full from this phase diagram. This competition is explained in the detailed\nanalysis in the sections below. As we will see, the simulations are notoriously hard, and, in certain cases, autocorrelation times that exceed one million Monte Carlo steps are observed, indicative of strong metastabilities and competing phases, perhaps in the vicinity of first-order transitions. This inevitably leads to a few uncertainties in the phase diagram, which can only be resolved if better algorithms are devised and better computer hardware is available.\nTo set the ideas, we briefly explain the phase diagram shown in Fig. 1. The phase diagram is dominated by two big areas: for V U the system separates into a bosonic and a fermionic system, and for U V the bosons form a uniform n = 1 Mott insulator above which the fermions are quasifree. We focus on the channel-like region in between. The solid red line demarcates the area of uniform bosonic superfluidity. It extends to remarkably large values of U and V and probably closes in a cuspy way for a value of V close to V = 6. Mesoscopic superflow is found for V = 8 and U = 14 as well but, extrapolating our results, it vanishes around L \u2248 500. In the tip of this region, the bosonic superfluid is marginal with a density matrix decaying faster than what is allowed for the pure bosonic system. We found no indications of bosonic supersolid behavior (i.e., concomitant bosonic superfluidity and density waves breaking the lattice symmetry). The dotted black line is the weak-coupling argument for phase separation (see Sec. III A), which is found to exist everywhere in the lower parts of the phase diagram. The dashed black lines are the leading-order strong-coupling predictions (see Sec. III B) separating phase separation, a structure with density wave character, and a uniform system. We suspect that phase separation extends up to the dotted black and cyan lines. In the fermionic sector, the fermions are insulating below the solid green line and show pair flow above and to the left of it, at least up to the system sizes that we can simulate. Above (below) the dashed blue line the decay of the charge-density wave (CDW) correlations is slower (faster) than for free fermions. Whether the charge-density waves can spontaneously break the lattice symmetry is impossible to say based on our system sizes for V 6, but for V = 8 we see some strong indications of that for U = 13. The dotted green line indicates a crossover scale where, on our length scales, the up and down particles are so weakly coupled on top of a uniform bosonic Mott insulator that they can be considered quasifree. For exponentially low temperatures, pair flow is expected everywhere in the upper part of the phase diagram.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Sec. III we present analytical arguments in the limiting cases of the phase diagram such as weak and strong interspecies coupling, arguments based on bosonization, and the type of induced interactions in the random phase approximation for various parameter regimes. This is followed by Sec. IV where we highlight some specifics of our quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, and we list in Sec. V all relevant quantities that are computed in the simulations and used for analyzing the phases. In Sec. VI we systematically go through the phase diagram for various values of V and discuss the obtained Monte Carlo results. In particular, renormalization flows as a function of the system size allow one to monitor the competing instabilities, and infer the structure of the phase diagram. Note that in this paper we refer to a renormalization flow\n054502-2\nalways as a flow in the system size, unlike in the setting of the renormalization group. We conclude in Sec. VII."

The instantaneous limit can be taken when the bosons are fast compared with the fermions. The velocity of the bare fermions at half filling (kF = \u03c0/2) is vF = 2t sin(kF ) = 2t . The instantaneous approximation is hence reasonable for low values of V when U is not too small; in particular, close to the bosonic Mott transition it is valid. In the static approximation we have\nD0static(x) = \u222b dk\n2\u03c0 eikx 2 k\u221a 2k + 2 kn0U . (4)\nThis induced interaction is spin agnostic, attractive on site (x = 0), but repulsive for x > 0 and scaling as \u223c1/x2, which is short range in one dimension but can be rather large for next- and next-next-nearest-neighbor interactions. If we nevertheless only keep the local part, then we arrive at an attractive Hubbard model whose phase diagram is known [53]. In particular, we expect dominant superconducting pair fluctuations, especially for weak V in this BCS-like regime, but the pairing gap is exponentially weak in the induced interaction and scales exponentially in \u221a V 2/U . Note that this approach neglects the back-coupling of the fermions on the bosons, i.e., it underestimates CDW structures, which, given the nonlocal form of the static interaction, could still be important. Furthermore, the induced pair superfluidity is in competition with a tendency to phase separate, which at the mean-field level is found when V 2 > U [20,28,36]. At U = 0 the bosons occupy a number of sites scaling as L1/3; the fermions occupy the rest. In the thermodynamic limit, coupling free bosons with spinless fermions via V is hence always unstable, with a separation line given by U = V 2/\u03c0 . However, in the case of induced interactions, the previous arguments do not immediately apply and the criterion for\nphase separation can be written as \u2202\u03bc\u03c3/\u2202n\u03c3 < 0 [20], which is numerically hard to use, however. Since the gain in energy due to quasicondensation is rather small in practice, we expect that the criterion found above is a very good upper bound and it is indicated by the dotted black line in Fig. 1. Simulations in close proximity to phase separation are difficult, and we saw no indications of being able to significantly improve on the behavior U = V 2/\u03c0 (which is also close to the bosonization prediction; see Sec. III D).\nThe bosons undergo a transition from a Luttinger liquid to a Mott insulator, which, for V = 0, is found at U = 3.25(5) [54]. Turning on V , and having established that the bosons are fast with respect to the fermions, the renormalization flow of the bosons is understood to be already strong on the system sizes that we can simulate, whereas the fermions remain nearly free. Neglecting the back-action of the bosons on the free fermions, the bosonic Mott transition shifts upwards quadratically with V 2 and proportionality factor D( ) = \u221a 1 \u2212 ( /2t )2/(\u03c0t ) at = 0. This prediction for the location of the bosonic to superfluid Mott insulator is a reasonable approximation for low values of V 1. As can be seen in Fig. 1, it is even not too bad at V = 2 but slightly overestimates the critical point because not all fermions can be considered noninteracting at the length scales of strong bosonic renormalization. When the bosons are deep in the uniform Mott insulator, we can approximate their dispersion by E (k) = + k22m\u2217 where is the gap (of order U in the pure bosonic system) and m\u2217 the effective mass for particle and hole excitations. The kernel is now DMott (x, \u03c4 ) =\u222b\ndk 2\u03c0 e ikxe\u2212 \u03c4 to leading order in the ground state. For 2t we hence cannot expect to see any induced interaction; i.e., the bosonic and fermionic systems decouple and the bosons remain in a uniform n = 1 Mott insulator and the fermions are quasifree (this is the upper part of the phase diagram in Fig. 1). For 2t induced interactions remain possible. However, in the weak-V limit and recalling the exponential weakness of the pairing gap, we can only see such pairing fluctuations when is very close to zero, which in turn requires very big system sizes to distinguish pair flow from two correlated superfluids."

            "text": "Since the system phase separates when U V , we focus on the regime where both couplings are strong, U,V 4t . We can map the system onto an effective model as follows. First, turning off the hopping amplitudes, we consider product states that minimize the potential energy subject to our filling constraints. We can fill M sites with two bosons, N sites with one fermion and one boson, and L \u2212 M \u2212 N sites with up and down fermions. Sites that contain more than two particles per site are higher in energy and are discarded. The energy of this configuration is Eg = MU + NV , subject to the constraint of particle number conservation, 2M + N = L. Eliminating N , we minimize Eg = M(U \u2212 2V ). Hence, for V < U/2 (this is the upper dashed black line in Fig. 1) we expect that every site contains one boson (i.e., we have a homogeneous bosonic Mott insulator with unit density) and one fermion on average. As there is no interaction between the fermions and the potential energy between bosons and fermions is constant (this\n054502-3\ncase is equivalent to the Hartree approximation), the fermions delocalize on top of the Mott insulator and behave as (nearly) free fermions. From the arguments in the previous paragraph we expect this behavior when the bosonic gap is large, while pair flow is expected for a small bosonic gap. For V > U/2 we must have that M = L/2, i.e., half of the system is doubly occupied with bosons and the other half with fermionic doublons (molecules). Even though all configurations are equally likely, we expect that the kinetic terms will select either the fully phase-separated regime or a phase with charge-density wave order.\nSecond, we analyze the effect of the hopping terms on those ground states to see which phase can lower its energy the most, and is hence preferred when we lower U away from U = 2V . In second-order perturbation theory there is only a diagonal virtual exchange term (no flips are possible) described by a Jz term:\nJz = 6t 2 B U \u2212 2t 2 B 2V \u2212 U \u2212 2t2F 2V . (5)\nThis predicts a transition to the phase-separated regime at V/U = 10+ \u221a 52\n24 \u2248 0.717 (this linear behavior is the lower dashed black line in Fig. 1).\nThe reliability of these arguments was checked with exact diagonalization using a Lanczos method. We computed a naive measure for phase separation, OPS, as the overlap of (one of) the ground states with fully phase-separated product states. This is an underestimation of the phase-separated states but for large V and U it is believed to be very accurate, consistent with the strong-coupling argument. In the phaseseparated regime we also expect the ground state to be L-fold degenerate. CDW order was probed by the staggered structure factor of the CDW correlation functions, as introduced in Sec. V, but divided by the number of sites. The ground state of a system with CDW order should be twofold degenerate in the thermodynamic limit. For V = 20, we see in Fig. 2 that the strong-coupling prediction is quantitatively accurate. Furthermore, the CDW order parameters for L = 6 and L = 8 lie on top of each other. Hence, finite-size effects are tiny. For V = 8, however (this is the largest value of V for which we have obtained quantum Monte Carlo results), the Lanczos results are far off from the thermodynamic limit, as can be seen in Fig. 3: the peak position of the CDW correlator shifts to larger values of U , and the signal diminishes with L. We also observe a tiny energy difference between the ground-state energy and the energy of the first excited state in this parameter regime. Based on the Lanczos results, we can envisage two scenarios: (i) the CDW correlations survive in the thermodynamic limit (as for V = 20) but with a very tiny amplitude, or (ii) there is no lattice symmetry breaking and we instead find a Luttinger liquid with dominant CDW power-law correlations. Also a combination is possible, where scenario (ii) is found close to the phase-separation regime and scenario (i) for larger values of U . Also the location of the phase-separation boundary could shift to larger values of U as we increase L. As we will see below, the quantum Monte Carlo results for substantially bigger L are likewise unable to differentiate between these scenarios. Especially for U = 14 we will see strong competing instabilities at work for up to\nhundreds of lattice sites. The quantum Monte Carlo simulations for V = 8 show the strongest tendency for CDW order at U = 13.\nFinally, For V = 12 (see Fig. 4), the Lanczos results suggest that true CDW order is stable for U 19, but probably not for smaller values of U where we would again expect dominant CDW power-law behavior.\nC. Intermediate coupling, V \u223c 3t\u20134t In this regime, we expect no simple analytical arguments to hold and give only a few comments on the phase diagram and/or the most surprising results here. Unlike for weak interspecies coupling, we can in this regime often monitor the\n054502-4\nrenormalization flow till the order is complete. In Fig. 5 we see how a full pair superflow has developed for V = 3 and U = 4.5 on a system size L \u223c 200.\nThe extension of the bosonic superfluid to these large values V = 4 is remarkable. For V = 4 and U = 6 the bosonic winding numbers (indicative of their superfluid density) remain constant as a function of system size, hinting at a superfluid. Fitting the equal-time bosonic density matrix with a power law d 1\n2\u03b7B (x|L) we extract that \u03b7B = 1.60(2) as is shown in Fig. 6. Recalling that we have commensurate bosons at unit filling, the fact that this Luttinger parameter is less than 2 and does not flow to zero with system size is paradoxical (see, however, the next section)."

The fermion degrees of freedom were subsequently cast in the standard spin and charge channels. If we assume that the spin sector is always massive thanks to the induced attractive interactions, which is supported by the Monte Carlo data except for the free fermion case (which we found when U V ), then the bosonization analysis bears a strong resemblance to the spinless case. In Ref. [31] it was assumed that the bosons are fast compared to the fermions. Lattice commensurabilities, which would lead to a nonlinear and hence nontractable problem, were analyzed to lowest order by looking at their scaling dimension only.\nThe predictions of the theory of Ref. [31] are that the single-particle bosonic density matrix decays as a power law,\nGb(x) \u223c x\u2212 12\u03b7b , (6) where \u03b7b (K in the notation of Ref.

(7) In the notation of Ref. [31], K\u03b4 = \u03b7bb. The momentum kb = \u03c0 is set by the bosonic filling factor. The transition to the bosonic Mott insulator is found for K\u03b4 = 2. Note that K\u03b4 > K > Kb (which allows the behavior seen in Fig. 6 with \u03b7b < 2). In the massive spin sector, the fermionic single-particle density matrix and the spin-density wave (SDW) correlator are exponential, but the CDW correlator has a power-law behavior as\nCCDW(x) \u223c cos(2k f x)x\u2212\u03b7CDW . (8)\n054502-5\nIn the notation of Ref. [31], \u03b7CDW = K\u03b2 + K\u03c3 \u2192 K\u03b2 . If the full form of the SDW correlator is needed, it is \u03b7SDW = K\u03b2 + K\u22121\u03c3 . The 2k f component of the singlet correlation function has a power law K\u03b2 + K\u22121\u03b3 , but the signal-to-noise ratio on this quantity in the Monte Carlo simulations is too low for this to be useful to us. The polaron operators mentioned in Ref. [31] are not implemented. We will take the pragmatic view that the generic form of the correlation functions above holds in the nonmassive phases in order to analyze our simulations. However, Ref. [31] has only limited power in predicting the phase diagram. It gives a good account of the phase separation (also quantitatively for low values of V ), and a criterion for the bosonic Mott transition (through K\u03b4 = 2), but it systematically predicts singlet pairing for the fermions for our microscopic parameters. For our parameters the commensurabilities are such that lattice symmetry breaking is possible, and that insulating CDW structures in the bosonic sector are also possible, which is incompatible with their assumptions."

The interspecies coupling then corresponds to a density-density coupling between the layers. For the fermions, we employ two types of worms: the standard algorithm, which samples the single-particle Green function for each component separately, and a two-worm algorithm necessary to be ergodic in the superconducting phases. The latter is implemented in the particle-particle or the particle-hole channel in such a way that the worm creation operator of the spin-up particles moves around in space-time synchronously as the worm creation operator for the spin-down particles, but not necessarily on the same site. In the particle-hole channel, it is the worm annihilation operator for one of the species that moves together with the worm creation operator of the other species. With these updates the algorithm is ergodic for superconducting phases made up of two fermions. Simulations would face an exponential barrier, however, in the case of a molecular superfluid phase consisting of the pairing between a hard-core boson and a soft-core boson because we do not allow configurations with the simultaneous presence of their respective worm operators. Such phases would certainly be important for other parameter choices than the ones we considered. Nevertheless, the simulations are often hard for large system sizes and inverse temperatures. We also employed simulated annealing strategies, in which we gradually lower the temperature, and also quench strategies, in which we take a stable and converged configuration in the, say, superconducting phase and then quench the parameters to a nearby point in parameter space where the simulations are harder. We typically scale system size and inverse temperature as L = \u03b2, as is justified for Luttinger liquids. Test simulations done for V 4 with a larger aspect ratio did not change the physics."

We examined in total 20 different\nquantities, which must behave consistently before we can be sure of the phase that we observe.\n(i) The superfluid density of the individual bosons is\n\u03c1s,b = L\u3008W 2 b \u3009 t\u03b2 , and that of \u201cfermions\u201d (simulated as hard-core bosons) is \u03c1s,\u03c3 = L\u3008W 2 \u03c3 \u3009\nt\u03b2 . Here, Wb and W\u03c3 are the winding numbers of the bosons and the fermions, respectively [55].

For the fermions, the Jordan-Wigner string between sites 0 and x must be inserted in the Monte Carlo measurements since the fermions are simulated as hard-core bosons [56]. Its Fourier transform yields the momentum distribution n\u03c3 (k) = \u2211x eikxG\u03c3 (x). Sign-positive statistics remain possible with periodic boundary conditions when the number of up spins and the number of odd spins are both odd.\n(iii) The equal-time four-point correlation functions are G pp(x) = \u3008c\u2020\u2191(x)c\u2020\u2193(x)c\u2191(0)c\u2193(0) + H.c.\u3009 and G ph(x) = \u3008c\u2020\u2191(x)c\u2193(x)c\u2191(0)c\u2020\u2193(0) + H.c.\u3009. These probe the Green functions of molecules seen as a local Cooper pair of two fermions with opposite spin. Due to the attractive induced interactions, G ph(x) should always decay exponentially in the thermodynamic limit.\n(iv) For grand-canonical simulations we computed the compressibility of the bosons, \u03bab = \u03b2(\u3008N2b \u3009 \u2212 \u3008Nb\u30092)/L, where Nb is the total number of bosons in the configuration.\n(v) For canonical simulations, we fine-tune the chemical potential \u03bcb such that \u3008Nb\u3009 = L. The fermionic chemical potentials are always \u03bc\u03c3 = V to ensure that \u3008n\u03c3 \u3009 = 1/2.\n(vi) In canonical simulations we also compute the bosonic Green function at zero momentum as a function of imaginary time, Gb(p = 0, \u03c4 ), in order to measure the bosonic singleparticle gap in the insulating phases. The Green function Gb(x = 0, \u03c4 ) was also computed for very low values of V in order to extract the speed of sound [46].\n(vii) We compute the connected static densitydensity correlation functions Cbb(x) = \u3008nb(x)nb(0)\u3009 \u2212 1, CCDW(x) = \u3008(n\u2191 + n\u2193)(x)(n\u2191 + n\u2193)(0)\u3009 \u2212 1, and CSDW(x) = 1 4 \u3008(n\u2191 \u2212 n\u2193)(x)(n\u2191 \u2212 n\u2193)(0)\u3009 for bosons and fermions in the CDW and SDW channels. We also compute the correlator CMDW(x) = \u3008M(x)M(0)\u3009, where M(x) = 2nb(x) \u2212 n\u2191(x) \u2212 n\u2193)(x) is the molecular-density wave correlator.\n(viii) We compute the corresponding structure factors Sbb(k) = \u2211 j eik jCb( j) and SCDW/SDW(k) =\u2211\nj e ik jCCDW/SDW( j).\nAs our bare fermions are noninteracting, their n\u03c3 (k) shows a Fermi surface with a jump of 1 at k = \u00b1kF = \u00b1\u03c02 . For finite V and increasing L, this jump decreases. In the thermodynamic limit, the jump must be zero as there are no quasiparticles in one dimension, only collective excitations. The jump is hence a good diagnostic for how strongly the renormalization flow from the noninteracting fermions into the Luttinger liquid (or a massive phase) has developed.\n054502-6\nWe always expect a spin gap because of the attractive induced interactions in the thermodynamic limit. The limit limq\u21920 \u03c0SSDW(q)/q should hence approach zero. In practice, any value below 1 for finite L is seen as evidence for a spin gap that will fully develop as L \u2192 \u221e. For a system with rotational spin invariance, one must have that limq\u21920 \u03c0SSDW(q)/q = 1. This is what we hence see for free fermions. Likewise, the limit limq\u21920 \u03c0SCDW(q)/q of the CDW structure factor captures the nonoscillating part of the CDW correlation function.\nSince it is possible to break a discrete symmetry in one dimension, true CDW order is possible. It is seen as CCDW(x) oscillating with C cos(\u03c0x) for large x and a constant C > 0. This implies that SCDW(k = \u03c0 ) grows linearly with L. True CDW order for the fermions must imply true CDW order for the bosons, and vice versa, due to the nature of the boson-fermion coupling. Strong CDW correlations are also possible in the form of quasi-long-range order, when the oscillating 2kF part of the CCDW(x) correlation function decays as \u223c|x|\u22122+\u03b1 . For \u03b1 > 0 this implies a diverging susceptibility. The density remains uniform in this case, just as the bosonic density remains uniform. In order to treat the periodic boundary conditions adequately, we must use the cord function d (x|L) = sin(\u03c0x/L) in the argument of the correlation functions (cf. Ref. [33]). Near half the system size, a power-law decay of the cord function is hard to discern from asymptotic (near-)constant behavior. Given our system sizes of the order L = 100 we are therefore often unable to discriminate between lattice symmetry breaking with a low value of C and a slowly decaying power law. In practice we attempted both fits, which are often equally good, and used a cutoff value of C \u2248 1L for true long-range order for at least L 70. We will refer to algebraic CDW order when the decay of the CDW correlations is described by a power law but slower than for free fermions, i.e., \u03b7CDW < 1."

The bosonic superfluid density, single-particle density matrix, and the properties of the fermionic single-particle matrices converge typically the fastest. Counterflow and especially pair-flow properties converge slower, and the largedistance charge-density wave properties are usually hard to determine precisely because of the low values involved. Our resolution on the V parameter is 1, as already mentioned, and it is 0.5 on the U parameter in the weak- and moderately strong-coupling regimes. For V = 6 and V = 8 the resolution on U is 1. This means that the error bars in the phase diagram must be of the order U/2. We do not attempt to discuss the nature of the phase transitions or determine their precise location for two reasons. First, although the data for the (bosonic) superfluid properties are suggestive of a Kosterlitz-Thouless renormalization flow, we do not know the value of the jump in \u03b7b at the transition. We take a pragmatic view and when we observe a typical scaling of the superfluid densities as\n\u223c1/ ln(L/L0) with L0 comparable to the lattice spacing, then we know that we are close to the critical point. Second, computing quantities like \u03b7CDW is known to be hard, already for systems with fewer flavors of particles [57,58]. When fitting the CDW correlation function, there are uncertainties about how to choose the fitting interval, the influence of a nonoscillating term 1/r2 (which is not always negligible) next to the oscillating first harmonic which has an unknown power-law decay, and the influence of the periodic boundary conditions. It is argued that a low-momentum analysis of the corresponding static structure factor (see Sec. V) gives a better signalto-noise ratio [58\u201360]. Although we also take this route here, the drawback in this approach is that there are cases where the curve bends down for low momenta. Increasing the system size adds lower momentum points to the curve, which in turn tends to bend the curve further down; i.e., the extrapolation to zero momentum can be misleading for small system sizes."

Looking again at the right-hand panel of Fig. 10, we see that Z \u223c 0.8 on the scales of relevant flow in the bosonic channel; hence 4.3(2) is more likely for the transition point.\nThe power law of the equal-time bosonic density matrix \u03b7b(V = 2,U = 4) = 2.02(1) appears to be nearly constant with L whereas it is flowing to zero with L for U = 4.5, as is shown in the left=hand panel of Fig. 11. The transition can also be studied from the scaled static structure factor, limk\u21920 2\u03c0S bb(k) k shown in the right-hand panel of Fig. 11, from which we extract \u03b7bb in the limit k \u2192 0. Bosonization [31] predicts the transition at \u03b7bb = 2, which is reflected in the data (see also the left-hand panel of Fig. 12).\nFigure 13 suggests that there is a strong tendency towards pair flow on mesoscopic system sizes. It is, however, impossible to monitor the flow for big enough system sizes, even where the lowest Z factors are found, i.e., for the lowest values of U as can be seen in Fig. 14 for U = 2 and\nk . Bosonization predicts a tran-\nsition from a Luttinger liquid to a Mott insulator when \u03b7bb = 2 (indicated by the dotted line). Right: The parameters \u03b7CDW (blue) and \u03b7SDW (purple) for V = 2 and L = 30, 50, and 70 (top to bottom) obtained from their respective static structure factors. The dotted line is the value of \u03b7CDW for free fermions. The parameter \u03b7SDW should scale to zero owing to the presence of a spin gap for attractive induced interactions.\n054502-8\nU = 1.5. Whereas no CDW order can be seen for the largest L (see Fig. 12), the extrapolation of the pair-flow density to the thermodynamic limit is nevertheless dangerous, as shown in Fig. 14 for U = 2 and U = 1.5 because the value of the superflow in the counterflow channel is still a quarter (half) of the one in the pair channel for U = 2 (U = 1.5) for L = 150. The superfluid density of the up fermions is also seen to be going down with L. In the pair-flow phase this value should be exactly 1/4 of the superflow density. We hence expect as a rule of thumb that \u3008W 2\u2191 \u3009 should approach \u223c0.26 for U = 2, which is one-quarter of the value seen in the pair-flow channel for the lowest system sizes and which appears roughly stable on the system sizes that we can simulate. Hence, the reduction seen in \u3008W 2\u2191 \u3009 with L is not necessarily a sign of insulating behavior at astronomically large L, but it cannot completely be ruled out either. The right-hand panel of Fig. 12 also shows that the spin gap is not fully developed on the length scales that we can simulate. Correlations in the charge sector decay algebraically, and slightly more rapidly than for free fermions as long as the bosons are superfluid, but the value of \u03b7CDW\nbecomes less than 1 when the bosons turn insulating. Note that it is common for one-dimensional superconducting systems to show subdominant CDW algebraic correlations [53]. The rather strong charge correlations can be understood based on the arguments presented in Sec. III A, and it further seems reasonable that superfluid bosons suppress such correlations as uniformity in the system is beneficial for phase rigidity."

In the bosonic superfluid regime the Z factors for the fermions range from 0.1 to 0.5 at L = \u03b2 = 110. Surprisingly, the power law of the bosonic density matrix at U = 5 is such that \u03b7b = 1.81(2) < 2 (which was given an explanation in Sec. III D) while the system stays uniform (see Fig. 16). For U = 4 this power law was just \u03b7b = 2.01(5). The values \u03b7bb, extracted as before from the scaled bosonic static structure factor, are \u03b7bb = 2.20(5) for U = 5, L = 70, and \u03b7bb = 1.75(5) for U = 5.5 and L = 70 and are compatible with a universal jump at \u03b7bb = 2 as predicted by bosonization [31].\nFrom the winding numbers squared in the pair-flow and counterflow channels, shown in Fig. 17, we infer a strong tendency towards superconducting pair-flow correlations that are almost fully developed (cf. Fig. 5 and the left-hand panel of Fig. 18). However, as can especially be appreciated from the data in the pair-flow channel in the range 3 U 5 (see\n054502-9\nthe right-hand panel of Fig. 17), the system is very hard to thermalize and simulate already for L > 50. Autocorrelation times are extremely large, ranging from 103 to 105 for L = 70 and rapidly increasing with L, which we attribute to the frustration caused by the induced interactions and the competition between paired and insulating phases. We did not find evidence of gapped CDW order anywhere in the phase diagram for V = 3. The parameter \u03b7CDW is above 1 everywhere in the bosonic superfluid regime: We find \u03b7CDW(U = 5, L = 70) = 1.10(5), \u03b7CDW(U = 5.5, L = 70) = 1.00(5), and \u03b7CDW(U = 6, L = 70) = 0.93(5).\nBased on the system sizes that are accessible to the simulations, the system is for V = 3 (i) in the phase-separation regime for U 3, (ii) a bosonic superfluid and uniform swave superconductor for 3 U < 5.3(2), and (iii) a bosonic Mott insulator for larger values of U . The fermions remain superconducting when U remains close to the critical value of the bosonic Mott transition, and then cross over towards free fermions when the gap \u2248 EF . As \u03b7CDW < 1 in this regime a tendency towards algebraic charge-density wave order is also observed."

The decay of the single-particle density matrix has, however, a power-law exponent that is less than 2, but \u03b7bb is above 2 (and in fact very close to 2 for U = 6.5). This is the behavior we previously referred to as a marginal superfluid (cf. Figs. 6 and 16).\nFrom the Z factors shown in the right-hand panel of Fig. 19 we see essentially non-Fermi-liquid behavior up to U = 8.5. Signs of phase separation were seen for U 5: Specifically, for U = 5 the bosonic superfluid density appears to flow to zero while \u03b7bb is considerably larger than 2. We will see such paradoxical behavior also for larger values of V , and interpret it as a sign of phase separation (see the discussion for larger values of V below). In addition, according to both the weak-coupling estimate, V 2/\u03c0 , and the strong-coupling one, V/0.717, we expect phase separation for U = 5.\nFrom the winding numbers squared in the pair-flow and the counterflow channels shown in Fig. 20 we see a tendency towards stable pair flow for U values in the range 7\u20138 on the system sizes that we can simulate, which are not enough to extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit because the Z factors remain large. We show in the right-hand panel of Fig. 21 the power-law decay of the four-point correlator G pp(x) and the simultaneous exponential decay of the four-point correlator G ph(x) for U = 7 and L = 70, which is indicative of a pair\n054502-10\nsuperflow. The weakness of the signal is in line with the weak superflow properties that we also observed based on the analysis of the winding numbers. For larger values of U 8.5 the fermions cross over to quasifree fermions, as we have seen before.\nFor smaller values of U 7.0(5) the pair flow looks stable on mesoscopic length scales but then abruptly jumps to zero, and the data are very noisy. In many cases, for instance for U = 6, we see an unphysical increase in the flow with L before jumping to zero at larger length scales (see Fig. 21). This noisy behavior (due to autocorrelation times that exceed 106) is in fact often encountered in our simulations (cf. the discussion for V = 3 before). When this happens, one has to wonder if the data at larger system sizes (here for L 90) have properly thermalized, but we are confident that this is so here: We saw a value of (near) 0 for U = 6 and L = 90 also in a simulation protocol in which the temperature was systematically lowered at fixed L, and also in a different protocol where we started from a configuration with stable superflow found at larger U after which we reduced the value of U . We therefore consider this system to be an insulator for the fermions.\nIn the left-hand panel Fig. 22 we show the extrapolated values of \u03b7CDW and \u03b7SDW obtained from the linear behavior of the static correlation functions SCDW/SDW(q) for small q. It is seen that the spin gap is fully developed for 5 < U < 7 at L \u223c 100. For larger values of U the behavior crosses over to the one of free fermions, which sets in around U = 9\u201310. Similar\nas for lower values of V , we see that \u03b7CDW drops below 1 when bosonic superfluidity is lost, indicating Luttinger liquid behavior with somewhat stronger charge fluctuations on top of a bosonic Mott insulator. We saw no conclusive evidence of lattice symmetry breaking for any value of U at V = 4 on the system sizes that we can simulate."

The bosonic winding number squared is plotted in the left-hand panel of Fig. 23. We indeed see a renormalization to zero for U 7.5 and stable superflow for U \u2248 8. The superflow is again marginal, as reflected in the decay of the single-particle density matrix, Gb(x), which decays already fast with an exponent \u03b7b \u2248 1.3 for L = \u03b2 = 30 and U = 8, but barely faster for L = \u03b2 = 90 where \u03b7b \u2248 1.2. We come back to the issue of bosonic superfluidity when discussing \u03b7bb. The fermionic Z factors are shown in the right-hand panel of Fig. 23. The flow scales inversely with system size and we see a very strong renormalization everywhere except when U 2V , in agreement with the arguments of Sec. III B. The winding numbers squared in the counterflow and pair-flow channels, shown in Fig. 24, show the tendency towards free fermionic behavior for U 12. For 9 U 10 the counterflow channel flows to zero with system size whereas the pair flow seems to approach a constant on mesoscopic length scales, within error bars, indicating superconducting correlations. This is elaborated in\n054502-11\nthe left-hand panel of Fig. 25 for U = 10. For smaller values of U 8.5 any superflow disappears in the thermodynamic limit. For U = 9 and U = 9.5 the signal is noisy; it indicates either thermodynamically stable superflow or mesoscopic flow extending over hundreds of sites. It is, given the data, certain that the bosonic and the fermionic pair flow do not coexist, and likely that they are adjacent in the phase diagram.\nWe plot the quantities \u03b7CDW and \u03b7SDW as a function of U and for L = 30, 50, and 70 in the right-hand panel of Fig. 25 obtained from the low-momentum analysis of the static CDW and SDW structure factors. In the region of putative bosonic superfluidity, we obtain values between 1 and 1.25 (and a fully developed spin gap), indicating a decay faster than the one of free fermions. The fermions are hence paired because of the attractive induced interactions but a picture of molecules with charge-density wave order does not apply. For U 9 the values of \u03b7CDW are below 1. Note that the spin gap has not fully developed for U 9.5 for L = 70, as can be seen in the lower curve of the right-hand panel in Fig. 26. The spin gap develops, however, rather quickly for U < 11, and (exponentially) slowly for U > 12. Figure 26 also shows \u03b7bb, which is larger than 2 for U = 8, in line with uniform bosonic superfluidity. For U 9 the flow towards a bosonic Mott insulator is apparent. At U = 8.5 the bosonic density-density correlation function has an exponent \u03b7bb < 2. It seems to be nearly constant on our system sizes (whereas it should flow to zero in a Mott-insulating phase). We attribute this to the (mesoscopic) superfluidity, which counters stronger density fluctuations (cf. also the behavior of \u03b7bb for U = 4.5 and V = 2 in Fig. 12 and for U = 14 and V = 8 in Fig. 35). Hence, within our system sizes, U = 8 shows a bosonic superfluid and is very close to the phase-separation line (and also very close to a Mott transition), whereas U = 8.5 is already on the Mott-insulating side based on its value of \u03b7bb.\nWe saw the strongest CDW correlations for U = 9 with \u03b7CDW = 0.72(3) and U = 9.5 with \u03b7CDW = 0.75(3), both for L = \u03b2 = 70, as shown in Figs. 25 and 26. These CDW correlations decay algebraically and for larger and smaller values of U they decay as faster power laws; for L = \u03b2 = 70 we find \u03b7CDW = 0.79(2) for U = 10. We did not see any indication of\nlattice symmetry breaking for V = 5 on the system sizes that we can simulate (cf. below for a discussion on this for V = 6 and V = 8). There remains the small region between the strong-coupling prediction for phase separation at U \u2248 7 and the onset of bosonic superfluid for U 8. The data show no sign of superflow in any channel, and furthermore \u03b7CDW and \u03b7bb are large because of an upturn in their respective structure factors at low momentum. At the phase-separation transition line the compressibility is divergent, with which the increase of \u03b7CDW and \u03b7bb is consistent. Most likely, on finite systems in the canonical ensemble, the data are already phase separated [58] and this leads us to the dotted cyan line in the phase diagram of Fig. 1. The dotted cyan line is for V = 4 and V = 5 in fair agreement with the weak-coupling prediction for phase separation."

As we do not know if the strong-coupling analysis applies, it could extend to higher values of U .\nThe bosonic winding number squared is plotted in the left-hand panel of Fig. 27. The flow stops for U = 9.5 on a scale L \u223c 150, and also for U = 10.5 it will vanish. For U = 10, the flow is reminiscent of the one of a critical point. The single-particle density matrix G decays with an exponent \u03b7b \u2248 1.1 for L = \u03b2 = 30 and goes down very slowly with system size as is seen from \u03b7b \u2248 1.0 for L = \u03b2 = 70. The value of \u03b7bb appears to be 1.98(2) for L = 70 (see the left-hand panel of Fig. 30). Whether any stable superflow for slightly different values of U at V = 6 can be found is outside our resolution. We will consider U = 10 a critical point; for the system sizes that we can simulate it behaves locally as a superfluid. The fermionic Z factors are shown in the right-hand panel of Fig. 27. We see a very strong renormalization towards non-Fermi-liquid behavior everywhere except for U > 12, which is in agreement with the argument given\n054502-12\nin Sec. III B. For U 11.5 the low values of Z (L) 0.2 indicate that we have good chances of monitoring the entire flow on the system sizes that we can simulate. The fact that we still need to go to L = 150 for U = 11 and U = 11.5 is, however, remarkable given that U,V t . The winding numbers squared in the counterflow and pair-flow channels, shown in Fig. 28, likewise show the tendency towards free fermionic behavior for U 14. For U = 12 the counterflow channel flows to zero with system size whereas the pair-flow channel seems to approach a nonzero value on mesoscopic length scales within error bars, indicating superconducting correlations (see the analysis in the left-hand panel of Fig. 29). For smaller values of U 10.5 any superflow disappears in the thermodynamic limit. For U = 11.5 the signal is noisy; it indicates either thermodynamically stable superflow or strong correlations at least extending over hundreds of sites and close to the transition. The induced pairing between the fermions cannot be caused by a soft bosonic mode.\nWe plot the quantity \u03b7CDW as a function of U and for L = 50 and 70 in the left-hand panel of Fig. 30 obtained from the low-momentum analysis of the static CDW structure factor. In the region of the (local) bosonic superfluid, we ob-\ntain values between 1 and 1.2 (and a fully developed spin gap), indicating a decay faster than the one of free fermions. The fermions are hence paired because of the attractive induced interactions but a picture of molecules with charge-density wave order does not apply. As the bosons gap out for larger L we expect \u03b7CDW to diminish as well. For U 11 the values of \u03b7CDW are below 1. Whether true lattice symmetry breaking develops is impossible to say given the data, but unlikely as shown in Figs. 31 and 32 for U = 11, which has the lowest value of \u03b7CDW: It is equally well possible to fit the CDW data\n054502-13\nwith a staggered constant at large distances as with a power law over the cord function, but the value of this constant is so low (and lower than 1/L such that far bigger system sizes would be needed to answer this question). As shown in the right-hand panel of Fig. 32 the CMDW correlation function shows the same oscillating (alternating) pattern as CCDW [and Cbb(x)] and has the largest amplitude. This strengthens the picture of a density wave consisting of alternating bosonic and fermionic molecules.\nWe now turn our attention to the region without superflow for U = 8.5\u20139.5. Care has to be taken with thermalization in this regime because in the absence of superflow properties we have no efficient updates, and the proximity of the phase separation further complicates the simulations. The spin gap is fully developed, and the bosonic single-particle density matrix decays exponentially on long enough length scales and the parameters \u03b7bb and \u03b7CDW are large. The behavior is similar to V = 4 and U = 5 and to V = 5 and U = 7\u20138, and, as discussed in the previous paragraph, this is interpreted as phase separation."

The bosonic superfluid properties are shown in the left-hand panel of Fig. 33. As one can expect for such strong values of U and V the bosons are in the thermodynamic limit always insulating. However, for U = 14 nonzero winding numbers can be observed up to \u223c500 sites (after extrapolation, not shown), with the typical flow for one-dimensional systems.\nIn the right-hand panel of Fig. 33 we see that the flow of the residue in the fermionic channel is completed for U 15. In Fig. 34 we observe that the pair-flow and counterflow signals decay to zero with system size for U = 15. However, very close to the U = 2V = 16 value, where our strong-coupling arguments favor a homogeneous system, indications of pair flow (at least on finite-size systems) are seen. For U 18 we are close to the behavior of decoupled, free fermions. In Fig. 35 we show the dependence of \u03b7bb, \u03b7CDW, and \u03b7SDW on U for L = 30, 50, and 70 as obtained from the low-momentum behavior of their respective static structure factors. The curve for \u03b7bb is nonmonotonous. The most likely explanation is that for U = 14 the mesoscopic bosonic superfluidity suppresses the density fluctuations, as we have seen for lower values of\n054502-14\nV . The \u201cfan\u201d does not visibly open for U = 14 although the value of \u03b7bb is below 2 (because it is still rather close to 2), but we expect it to open for larger system sizes when the bosonic superfluidity is negligible. The suppression of charge fluctuations in the bosonic channel is then also reflected in \u03b7CDW. This parameter point (U = 14 and V = 8) demonstrates a recurrent theme of this paper, namely, monitoring competing instabilities to more than 100 lattice sites.\nFor U 15, we see strong indications of bosonic insulating behavior, similar to what we have seen before in the regime U \u223c 2V . For U = 13 we observe a fast reduction of \u03b7bb with L. The spin gap is fully developed on our length scales up to the point when U \u223c 2V , then shows a strong renormalization on the length scales that we can study for U values in the range 15\u201318 and \u03b7SDW approaches 1 from below in the quasifree fermion regime for larger values of U . This is also similar to what we have seen before. For U 15, \u03b7CDW < 1 and it approaches 1 from below when further increasing U as we approach the regime of quasifree fermions.\nThere are fingerprints of spontaneous lattice symmetry breaking for U = 13 based on the linear scaling of the staggered static structure factors in the bosonic and CDW (and MDW) channels, as shown in Fig. 36. The slope in the lefthand panel of Fig. 36 for the CDW channel is consistent with the value C = 0.10(2) seen in the right-hand panel of Fig. 35. Although the bosonic structure factor also scales extensively with L, its slope is less steep than for the fermions. The spin-density wave structure factors are obviously insensitive to such charge order. Given the absence of any superflow, this data point would then be in an insulating phase characterized with alternating bosonic molecular pairs and fermionic molecular pairs, and is predicted by the strong-coupling arguments of Sec. III B. Nevertheless, the observed order is weak, and a final answer would require bigger system sizes. We were not able to let the simulations converge for those, however. For U = 16, the right-hand panel of Fig. 29 is suggestive of stable pair flow. In Fig. 37 the data for the CDW structure factor can equally well be fitted by a linear line as with a logarithm. Given the very low value of the linear slope, an interpretation of the data in terms of the absence of lattice symmetry breaking (and thus the logarithmic fit) is more likely, however. This\ncan also be understood from the strong-coupling arguments of Sec. III B: For U > 2V we expect a uniform n = 1 bosonic Mott insulator, and U = 2V is the critical point. The strongcoupling arguments have hence quantitative predictive power for the upper boundary at V = 8. In between U = 13 and U = 16 (not shown) the staggered structure factors are seen to diminish with increasing U , and one cannot be sure about spontaneous lattice symmetry breaking. For \u03b7CDW, U = 14 has a higher value than U = 13, which we attributed to the mesoscopic bosonic superflow. For U = 15 we find, however, the lowest \u03b7CDW.\nThe data in the regime U = 11.5\u201312 is again contradictory and misleading. The fermionic residues indicate the absence of quasiparticle degrees of freedom, and the Luttinger parameters indicate a Luttinger liquid with \u03b7CDW > 1. The bosons are nonsuperfluid but have \u03b7bb > 2. As with similar conflicting\n054502-15\nresults for V = 5 and V = 6, we think that these values of U are in the phase-separation regime. The strong-coupling arguments from Sec. III B are for V = 8 not quantitatively precise for the lower boundary, although the dashed black and dotted cyan lines will merge for somewhat larger values of V in the phase diagram of Fig. 1: Lanczos results for very small system sizes and V = 20 show very good agreement with the strong-coupling predictions (cf. Figs. 2\u20134)."

            "text": "The simulation of multicomponent systems, weakly induced interactions, competing instabilities at work on hundreds of lattice sites, and long autocorrelation times presents a frontier in current computational physics. The system under investigation, a one-dimensional mixture of scalar bosons and S = 1/2 fermions defined on the lattice and subject to Hubbard interactions, is perhaps the simplest model where such physics can be explored. We employed path-integral Monte Carlo simulations with worm-type updates to simulate this system. We have introduced worm-type operators for all single-particle Green functions, but restricted the two-worm operators to the particle-particle and particle-hole channels of the spin-up and spin-down fermions. Although the algorithm is efficient almost everywhere in the nongapped part of the phase diagram, there are cases where the autocorrelation times explode for reasons ill understood. Despite the numerical challenges, the phase diagram shown in Fig. 1 is brought under reasonable control. It is straightforward to understand that for V U the system phase separates, and that for U V the bosons impose a uniform n = 1 Mott insulator on top of which the fermions remain quasifree. In between, the bosons induce attractive interactions between the fermions, which must lead to a spin gap. We have systematically monitored the development of the spin gap and the fermionic residue as a function of V , U , and L, and used it as an indication of how close we are to the thermodynamic limit. The induced interactions can lead to phase separation, pair flow, and/or molecular-density wave structures. For not too high values of V , the bosons are found to be uniformly superfluid in between the phase-separation and Mott-insulator phases. Bosonic superfluidity is the dominant energy scale, and this in turn suppresses fermionic charge fluctuations. The bosonic superfluid is most likely adjacent to the regime of phase separation by a first-order transition. The Mott insulator is reached\nby a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition when \u03b7bb = 2 (this is the exponent governing the decay of the bosonic density-density correlation function), and this implies that \u03b7b (the exponent governing the power-law decay of the off-diagonal singleparticle, equal-time bosonic density matrix is less than 2 at and close to the Mott transition), in line with the predictions from bosonization [31]. We referred to \u03b7b < 2 as a marginal superfluid (see Fig. 6). We find a bosonic superfluid (almost) up to V = 6 and U = 10, and even for V = 8 and U = 14 there is mesoscopic bosonic superflow up to several hundreds of lattice sites. Superflow for such large values U,V t is a clear signature of the competition in the system: it must be that there is a delicate parameter regime where induced interactions between the bosons mediated by the fermions lower the value of U and prefer a homogeneous system. At least up to the system sizes that we can simulate (note that the \u201cCooper\u201d pair size exceeds hundreds of lattice sites even for V = 2), the signal in the counter- and pair-flow channels hints at pair flow for the fermions for low values of V < 4, with \u03b7CDW > 1 as long as the bosons are superfluid. For Mott-insulating bosons, we immediately arrive at \u03b7CDW < 1 throughout the phase diagram. For V = 4 and V = 5 we observe a transition between pair flow and insulating fermionic behavior as a function of U that is very hard to simulate and therefore hard to determine precisely. The quantity \u03b7CDW is not strongly affected by this. We expect for very large values of V,U t that over the range V/0.717 < U < 2V a molecular charge-density wave alternating with bosonic molecular pairs is formed (see Sec. III B). We see some evidence for that for V = 8 and U = 13 as shown in Fig. 36, but increasing U further leads to a reduction in the strength of the charge order correlations.\nNumerical data for this paper are available [61]. Our simulations make use of the ALPSCore library [62] for error evaluation."
