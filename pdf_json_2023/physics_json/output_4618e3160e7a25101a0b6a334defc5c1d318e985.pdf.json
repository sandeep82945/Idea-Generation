    "abstractText": "Meropenem (MRP)-Vaborbactam (VBR) is a novel beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor used for the management of difficult-to-treat Gram-negative infections. Among critically ill patients, MRP-VBR shows remarkable inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetic behavior, thus justifying the implementation of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for improving real-time management in different challenging scenarios. In this study, we developed and validated a fast and sensitive Liquid Chromatography\u2013Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of MRP and VBR in human plasma microsamples of 3 microliters. The analysis required only a single-step sample preparation and was performed by means of a fast chromatographic run of 4 min, followed by positive electrospray ionization and detection on a high-sensitivity triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer operated in multiple reaction monitoring modes. The straightforward analytical procedure was successfully validated, based on the EMA guidelines, in terms of specificity, sensitivity, linearity, precision, accuracy, matrix effect, extraction recovery, the limit of quantification, and stability. The novel method was successfully applied for simultaneously measuring MRP and VBR concentrations in more than 42 plasma samples collected from critically ill patients affected by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria infections.",

            "text": "Meropenem (MRP)-Vaborbactam (VBR) is the combination of a carbapenem with a first-in-class boronic acid-based \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor. VBR is added to the therapy to restore the antibacterial effect of MRP by blocking its degradation promoted by the serine beta-lactamases. This antibiotic protects a primary \u03b2-lactam, MRP, with a new \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor, and expands the limited options for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Gramnegative infections. The MRP-VBR combination was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2018 for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, complicated intraabdominal infections, and hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia [1]. Similar to other traditional and novel beta-lactams, meropenem-vaborbactam exhibits time-dependent pharmacodynamics, being efficacy related to the percentage of the dosing interval, so that the unbound concentration is maintained above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the targeted pathogen (%f T > MIC) [2]. Experimental pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models found that a T > MIC greater than 40% for meropenem\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 719. https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics12040719 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antibiotics\nis required for bacterial killing, whereas the relationship between vaborbactam exposure and microbiological response in terms of 2-log kill and suppression of resistance is defined by an area-under-curve (AUC)/MIC ratio of 24 [2]. It shows good in vitro activity against Enterobacterales producing KPC and/or other types of class A serine carbapenemases, including KPC mutant strains conferring resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam and difficult-to-treat (DTR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa [2]. Conversely, the activity of meropenem-vaborbactam against isolates producing class B or D carbapenemases is limited [2]. Several real-world studies found a promising activity of MRP-VBR in terms of the clinical and microbiological outcome against difficult-to-treat (DTR) Gram-negative infections, including KPC-producing Enterobacterales and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa [3\u20135]. Additionally, starting MRP-VBR therapy within 48 h in DTR Gram-negative infections was independently associated with reduced negative clinical outcomes [5]. Unfortunately, it is noteworthy that resistance development has been reported also in patients exposed to MRPVBR [6], and that identifying optimal dosing schedule in presence of challenging scenarios (e.g., renal replacement therapy, augmented renal clearance) still remains an unmet clinical need [7]. Consequently, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) could be a helpful tool for assessing the attainment of optimal MRP-VBR pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target. Several high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS) methods have been developed for measuring MRP in biological fluids, either in plasma [8\u201311] or in serum [12\u201315] However, there are only a few available methods for measuring simultaneously MRP and VBR in biological fluids by means of HPLC [8,16] or of LC-MS/MS methods [17\u201319], and all of these are based on traditional blood sampling volume, namely 3\u20135 mL. The aim of this work was to develop a fast, selective, and simple LC-MS/MS method for quantifying simultaneously MRP and VBR in human plasma microsamples of only 3 \u00b5L and to validate it for enabling routine application for TDM purposes in patients treated with MRP-VBR."

Proton ion adducts of MRP and meropenem-d6 (MRP-d6) were detected by means of the following mass transitions: 384.2\u2013141.0 m/z and 390.2\u2013147.1 m/z and daughter ion intensity over retention time were used to generate multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) ion extraction chromatograms. Negative ion mass transitions at 296.0\u2013234.1 m/z and 269.0\u201396.0 m/z were employed to detect VBR and AvibactAM-c13 (AVI-C13), respectively. Optimization of MRP signals resulted in parameters as reported in Table 1.\nLC-MS/MS conditions were set for granting sharp peak shape and quality regardless of the very short chromatographic run time. For this purpose, the ZORBAX Eclipse plus C18 column was selected, and simple mobile phases were prepared. A mobile phase consisting of (A) water-formic acid (100:0.1, v/v) and (B) methanol-formic acid (100:0.1, v/v) was applied with an elution gradient, as summarized in Table 2. The total chromatographic\nrun time was as short as 4 min, but this did not impair the chromatographic performance. The retention times were 1.21 and 2.35 min, for MRP and VBR, respectively (Table 1), and a reconditioning step of 0.5 min at 0.5 mL/min flow with 5% of the B phase (Table 2) was utilized for ensuring proper column reconditioning between runs. The very good reproducibility of the retention times observed between different runs confirmed that the reconditioning step was really effective.\nFigures 1a and 2a show MRM chromatograms obtained by analyzing drug-free plasma samples. In these chromatograms only the signals of MRP-d6 and the AVI-C13 were present. This confirms both the MRM transitions specificity, and the purity of the internal standards (ISs) solution employed. Figures 1b and 2b show MRM chromatograms obtained by analyzing a very low concentration sample (equal to the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ). In these chromatograms, the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio for MRP and VBR peak was 77.6 and 61.9, respectively, confirming the high sensitivity of the method. The real sample MRM chromatograms (Figures 1c and 2c) showed that peak shape and resolution were optimal for MRP and acceptable for VBR. In the VBR chromatograms, an isobaric peak appeared at approximately 0.4 min, but no interference with the VBR detection and/or quantification is expected, since it is very far from the VBR retention time (2.35 min).\n2.2. Method Validation 2.2.1. Sensitivity\nThe LLOQ for both MRP and VBR was 0.1 mg/L, corresponding to the lowest point of the calibration curve. The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio for MRP and VBR was 77.6 and 61.9, respectively (Figure 1b,c), namely values significantly higher than the usually considered LOQ for both compounds (10).\n2.2.2. Selectivity and Carry-Over\nTen MRP-VBR-free plasma samples collected from hospitalized patients were analyzed to verify the eventual presence of interferences generated by endogenous components and/or by other drugs. MRM chromatograms of drug-free plasma samples (Figure 1a and Figure 2a) showed no interfering peaks in correspondence with the retention times for both analytes, supporting the high specificity of the LC-MS/MS method. MRM chromatograms of drug-free plasma samples injected after running the Upper Limit of Quantification (ULOQ) level showed that peaks had areas below 20% of the LLOQ peak area, thus confirming that carry-over was negligible.\n2.2.3. Linearity and Limit of Quantification (LOQ)\nThe calibration curve models using a response (=MRP peak area/MRP-d6 peak area ratio or VBR peak area/AVI-C13 peak area ratio) over nominal concentrations showed good data fitting (example in Figures 3 and 4). The equations calculated by pooling data obtained in seven different days were y = 0.383x and y = 0.705x for MRP and VBR, respectively. The average regression coefficients (R2) were 0.99 for MRP and 0.98 for VBR, respectively.\n2.2.4. Dilution Integrity\nFor checking dilution integrity, 3 independent samples were prepared at 200 mg/L and tested for accuracy and precision in triplicate (N = 9). The average accuracy was within \u00b115% of the nominal concentration and the coefficient of variation (CV) was 8.2%.\n2.2.5. Accuracy and Precision\nThe precision (mean CV%) and accuracy (mean BIAS%) of MRP results are summarized in Table 3. The intra- and inter-day CVs ranged from 9.8% to 10.5%, and from 10.2% to 10.6% for MRP and VBR, respectively. Likewise, the intra- and inter-day accuracy bias of\nthe Lower Quality Control (LQC), Medium QC (MQC), and High QC (HQC) ranged from 8.7% to 9.5% and from 4.1% to 10.6%, respectively.\nThe precision (mean CV%) and accuracy (mean BIAS%) of VBR results are shown in Table 4. The intra- and inter-day CVs ranged from 10.8% to 12.5% and from 8.2% to 10.4%, respectively. Likewise, the intra- and inter-day accuracy bias of the LQC, MQC, and HQC ranged from 7.5% to 9.5% and from 7.1% to 13.3%, respectively.\n2.2.6. Matrix Effect and Extraction Recovery\nPercent Matrix effect (%ME) and percent Extraction Recovery yield (%ER) were calculated at low, medium, and high concentration levels for both MRP (Table 5) and VBR (Table 6). At all the tested concentrations, the signal enhancement effect was slight for MRP and strong for VBR. After normalizing for the internal standard, the matrix effect values matched the criteria (<15% between different matrix lots) established by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) for validation.\nExtraction recovery yield was very favorable for both compounds ranging from 86.3 to 91.4 for MRP and from 76.3 to 86.4 for VBR. These values satisfied the EMA criteria and pointed out that IS addition is needed for providing accurate quantification throughout the whole dynamic tested range.\n2.2.7. Stability\nMRP and VBR stability were tested at all QC levels in different operating conditions, as specified in Tables 7 and 8. After the first freeze and thaw cycle, concentration decrease was relevant for MRP and less marked for VBR. This highlights the need for careful sample management when reprocessing samples. Autosampler extracts kept at 10 \u25e6C were stable for less than 1 h, thus strongly limiting the possibility of reanalyzing sample extracts. However, autosampler extracts frozen at \u221220 \u25e6C were stable for 24 h.\nTypes of Sample Tested Conditions\nAvg Accuracy (Bias%)\nAvg Accuracy (Bias%)\nAvg Accuracy (Bias%)\nQuality Control LQC MQC HQC\nTypes of Sample Tested Conditions\nAvg Accuracy (Bias%)\nAvg Accuracy (Bias%)\nAvg Accuracy (Bias%)\nextracts autosampler post 2 h \u221212.1 \u221219.2 \u221214.6\nfreezer post 24 h \u22129.5 \u22128.7 \u22129.1\nplasma samples\nfreeze-thaw stability\n1 cycle \u22128.8 \u22129.1 \u22129.4 2 cycle \u221215.1 \u221219.2 \u221212.6 3 cycle \u221227.4 \u221225.1 \u221226.3"

            "text": "An accurate, precise, and sensitive bioanalytical method for the simultaneous measurement of MRP and VBR concentrations in plasma microsamples of 3 microliters was developed and validated. Our method was very sensitive and allowed reliable quantification of concentrations as low as 0.1 mg/L. This level of sensitivity is the highest in the analysis of MRP and VBR among the available LC-MS/MS techniques [18,19], and was granted in plasma microsamples. This is an added value for TDM purposes, as it ensures accurate precision in the measurement of MRV and VBR plasma concentrations. The method selectivity was very efficient, as witnessed by the fact that no interference due to endogenous compounds and/or co-administered drugs was observed in the chromatograms of 10 pools of plasma samples obtained by mixing blood drawn from hospitalized patients. This finding was consistent with those observed in other studies measuring MRP and VBR concentrations by means of LC-MS/MS methods [18,19], even if the much smaller plasma sample size used by us (3 vs. 100 \u00b5L) may suggest a better absolute sensitivity of our method. The compound-specific MRM transitions used in our methods were similar to those implemented in previous studies [18,19], and this granted high selectivity. Sample preparation was simple and straightforward, involving just one dilution step of plasma with water (1:17 v/v) followed by solvent protein crash-down. Sample dilution allowed to reduce the total amount of biological matrix and this made sample extracts very clean. The use of methanol as a crash-down solvent in a 3:1 v/v ratio with water provided an extraction yield of around 80% for both compounds. Notably, this extraction yield was higher compared to those reported in previous studies [18,19]. The method was reliable and simple with no need of implementing complex conditions for improving chromatographic resolution. The setting was simple, namely a reverse-phase C18 column and a binary gradient with water and methanol for the mobile phase, but granted sharp peak shape and reliable elution of the two analyte peaks. The very fast chromatographic run time (4 min) was similar to those reported in previous LC-MS/MS methods [18,19]. The very good precision and accuracy shown by our method are mandatory conditions for granting reliable measurements of MRP and VBR for TDM purposes in the clinical setting. The linearity of the calibration curve over a wide dynamic range of concentrations from 0.1 to 100 mg/L may allow direct processing of clinical samples in most cases with no need for preliminary dilution. In any case, even if re-analysis after sample dilution was the case, the analysis would be reliable as granted by the favorable outcome of the dilution integrity tests. The limitations of our study should be acknowledged. The chromatographic peak for VBR was not fully symmetrical, showing suboptimal retention of VBR in implemented RP conditions. However, the peak shape was acceptable and peak purity adequate, allowing us to successfully perform quantitative validation. No deuterated internal standard was used for VBR. We are well aware that in LC-MS/MS methods isotopically labeled analogue should be used as the internal standard of the corresponding analyte, but this was unfeasible due to commercial unavailability at the time of the study. Consequently, we used AVIC13 as IS, similar to what was previously done by other methods assessing MER/VBR plasma concentrations [17\u201319], with good results. Finally, the short stability of MRP, namely an issue very well-known in literature [17,20], was confirmed in the stability test conducted in our study, whereas VBR showed longer stability. Accordingly, to prevent degradation during transport, blood samples must be delivered to the lab without any delay and must be processed promptly or alternatively should be stored at \u221280 \u25e6C after blood centrifugation and plasma separation. Finally, the relevant degradation of MRP after just one freeze\u2013thawing cycle obliges us to consider that analysis of freeze\u2013thawed samples can accurately be performed only once."

Selectivity and Carry-Over\nTen different plasma samples were analyzed for checking the absence of interfering signals that may be resulted from endogenous and/or exogenous components of the matrix at the retention times of the analytes and of the deuterated IS. The carry-over effect was evaluated by injecting blank plasma samples after the ULOQ calibration standard, being considered negligible if the signal in the blank was lower than 20% of that of the LLOQ.\n4.5.2. Linearity and Limit of Quantification (LOQ)\nSix plasma calibrators were created by spiking blank matrices with MRP-VBR and the respective isotopic ISs, over the range from 0.1 to 100 mg/L. Linearity of the calibration curve was confirmed by means of the fitness-for-purpose approach.38. The LLOQ was defined by the lowest calibrator in the selected dynamic range (0.1 mg/L) and showed a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) higher than 10.\n4.5.3. Precision and Accuracy\nPrecision (mean CV%) and accuracy (mean BIAS%) were assessed by analyzing the LQC, the MQC, and the HQC five times both on the same day (intra-day) and on three different days (inter-day).\n4.5.4. Dilution Integrity\nDilution integrity refers to the ability to dilute with a control matrix prior to the analysis of a sample containing the target analyte at a concentration higher than that of the ULOQ into the concentration range of the assay and obtain an accurate estimate of the concentration prior to dilution [21]. To achieve this, three independent samples were prepared in a two-fold higher concentration than of the ULOQ (200 mg/L) followed by dilution (1:3) in drug-free plasma before extraction. Diluted samples were tested for accuracy and precision: the acceptance limits were CV < 15% for precision and within \u00b115% of the nominal concentration for accuracy.\n4.5.5. Matrix Effect and Extraction Recovery\nPercent Matrix effect (ME) and Extraction Recovery (ER) of the LQC, the MQC and the HQC levels were calculated by means of the following equations:\nME (%) = B/A \u00d7 100 and ER (%) = C/B \u00d7 100 where: A is the Analyte/Internal Standard peak area ratio obtained by injecting watermethanol 1:3 v/v samples (N = 3) spiked at the three concentration levels. B is the Analyte/Internal Standard peak area ratio obtained by injecting a drug-free plasma extract (N = 3) spiked at the three concentration levels after extraction. C is the Analyte/Internal Standard peak area ratio obtained by injecting drug-free plasma (N = 3) spiked at the three concentration levels before extraction. ME and ER were assessed on ten different patients\u2019 plasma samples for addressing the issue of individual matrix composition variability.\n4.5.6. Stability\nThe stability of MRP and VBR in human plasma and their extract was assessed by comparing the nominal concentrations at low, medium, and high QC levels with those observed under different storage conditions: a. sample extracts boarded on the autosampler at 10 \u25e6C for 24 h; b. sample extracts kept at \u221220 \u25e6C for 24 h; c. matrix samples after three complete freeze and thaw cycles from \u221280 \u25e6C to 25 \u25e6C.\nStability in the above operating conditions was deemed suitable if MRV and VBR concentrations were within \u00b115% of the nominal value."
