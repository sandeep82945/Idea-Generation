1. **Investigate the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on service industry employees' work engagement and job insecurity.** This study focused on the immediate effects of the pandemic, but it would be valuable to examine how these effects change over time. Do employees' work engagement and job insecurity levels eventually return to pre-pandemic levels? Or do they remain elevated, or even worsen, in the long term?


2. **Explore the role of individual differences in moderating the relationship between the COVID-19 fear and work engagement.** This study found that safety leadership can moderate the relationship between the COVID-19 fear and job insecurity, but it is likely that other individual differences also play a role. For example, employees with higher levels of resilience or optimism may be less likely to experience job insecurity or disengagement, even in the face of a pandemic.


3. **Examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on service industry employees' mental and physical health.** This study focused on work-related outcomes, but it is important to consider the broader impact of the pandemic on employees' well-being. Are service industry employees experiencing higher levels of anxiety, depression, or other mental health problems? Are they more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking, drinking, or overeating?


4. **Investigate the effectiveness of different interventions for reducing job insecurity and increasing work engagement among service industry employees.** This study identified several factors that can contribute to job insecurity and disengagement, but it did not test the effectiveness of any interventions for addressing these issues. Future research could examine the effectiveness of interventions such as job training, career counseling, or financial assistance in reducing job insecurity and increasing work engagement.


5. **Explore the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and other workplace stressors.** This study focused on the COVID-19 pandemic as a unique stressor, but it is important to consider how it interacts with other workplace stressors. For example, employees who are already experiencing high levels of stress due to job demands or work-life conflict may be more vulnerable to the negative effects of the pandemic.
