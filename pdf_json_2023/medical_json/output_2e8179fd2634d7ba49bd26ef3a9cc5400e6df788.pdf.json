    "abstractText": "We investigated the effect of pegylated recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (PEGrhG-CSF) on lymphocytes and white blood cells of patients with malignant tumors. After PEG-rhG-CSF treatment, the count of lymphocytes increased in 66 cases, remained unchanged in 2 cases, and decreased in 20 cases. The difference in lymphocyte count before and after treatment was statistically significant (P < 0.001). White blood cell changes were positively correlatedwith lymphocyte changes (r = 0.36, P = 0.001). In the subgroup with increased white blood cells (n = 80), there were 62 cases with increased lymphocytes, 1 case with unchanged lymphocytes, and 17 cases with decreased lymphocytes after PEG-rhG-CSF treatment. There was significant difference in the count of lymphocytes and white blood cells (P < 0.001). In the subgroup with 6mg of PEG-rhG-CSF (n = 66) and the subgroup with 3mg of PEG-rhG-CSF (n = 22), the changes of white blood cell and lymphocyte counts before and after treatment were statistically significant (P < 0.001). The two were positively correlated in the 6mg PEG-rhG-CSF subgroup, with correlation coefficient r = 0.34 (P = 0.002). PEG-rhGCSF can increase the count of lymphocytes and white blood cells in patients with malignant tumors, and the increase of lymphocytes is positively correlated with the increase of white blood cells.",

            "text": "Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are still important modes of comprehensive treatment for malignant tumors [1], and neutropenia is the most common hematological toxicity during chemotherapy and radiotherapy. It often induces fever during neutropenia (FN), septic shock, and even death, which seriously affects the clinical treatment and survival of tumor patients and increases medical expenses [2,3]. Pegylated recombinant human granulocyte colonystimulating factor (PEG-rhG-CSF) is a glycoprotein that can bind to specific receptors on the surface of granulocyte progenitor cells or mature neutrophils. It can promote the proliferation and differentiation of granulocyte progenitor cells and enhance the phagocytosis and killing ability of neutrophils [4]. PEG-rhG-CSF is a long-acting, self-regulating stimulator with a plasma half-life of 47 h and only needs to be applied once after each chemotherapy cycle. The standardized management guidelines for chemotherapy-related neutropenia have been issued [5,6], which recommends the prophylactic application of PEGrhG-CSF at 24\u201372 h after chemotherapy. PEG-rhG-CSF can effectively reduce the incidence and severity of neutropenia caused by chemotherapy and shorten the duration of neutropenia [7,8]. However, the effects of PEG-rhG-CSF on lymphocytes and white blood cells remain unclear.\nHerein, this study analyzed the effect of PEG-rhG-CSF on lymphocyte and white blood cell count during chemotherapy in patients with malignant tumors.

            "text": "Neutropenia occurs in 25\u201340% of patients treated initially with chemotherapy, and neutropenia results in delayed chemotherapy and dose reduction in more than 60% of patients. Human granulocyte CSF (hG-CSF) is often used to treat neutropenia in clinic. PEG-rhG-CSF has been confirmed to be as effective as hG-CSF in preventing and treating chemotherapy-related myelosuppression and FN [10].\nHowever, hG-CSF is a short-acting drug and should be applied three to seven times per chemotherapy cycle. Meanwhile, PEG-rhG-CSF is a long-acting drug and needs to be applied only once at 24 h after each chemotherapy cycle, which is more convenient. In addition, Huang et al. showed that PEG-rhG-CSF had a stronger immune cellmodulating effect compared to rhG-CSF in breast cancer patients [11]. Therefore, we focused on PEG-rhG-CSF in this study.\nPEG-rhG-CSF has a definite effect on granulocytes. However, there are limited studies on the effects of PEG-rhG-CSF on immune cells (especially lymphocytes), immune microenvironment, and immune status in patients with malignant tumors. This study investigated the effect of PEG-rhG-CSF on lymphocytes and white blood cells in patients with malignant tumors. Our results found that lymphocyte counts were significantly increased in 66 cases after PEG-rhG-CSF treatment. The white blood cell increase was positively correlated with lymphocyte increase (correlation coefficient r = 0.36, P = 0.001). Pearson regression analysis showed a highly significant regression coefficient (1% significance level). On average, for every 1 \u00d7 109/L increase in white blood cells, lymphocytes will increase by 0.02 \u00d7 109/L. This indicates that PEG-rhG-CSF can increase lymphocyte counts in patients with malignant tumors. Single-cell analysis by Franzke et al. showed that CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells also expressed G-CSF receptors after stimulationwith short-acting G-CSF, and that G-CSF could regulate T cells directly through these receptors [12]. We speculate that it may be possible that treatment with long-acting PEG-rhGCSF can also cause CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells in patients with malignancies to express G-CSF receptors, which in turn can regulate T cells and elevate lymphocyte\ncounts through these receptors. More in-depth studies are needed to confirm this speculation.\nIn this study, we further analyzed the subgroup with increased white blood cells after PEG-rhG-CSF treatment. The changes in lymphocytes and white blood cells were also significantly different in this subgroup, and there was a positive correlation between increased white blood cells and increased lymphocytes, with a correlation coefficient of 0.34. A mean increase of 1 \u00d7 109/L in white blood cells indicates a mean increase of 0.03 \u00d7 109/L in lymphocytes.\nIn the subgroup with increased white blood cells after PEG-rhG-CSF treatment, the increase in lymphocytes was more significant along with the increase in white blood cells than in the all-case group. It is hypothesized that this may be because patients with increased white blood cells after PEG-rhG-CSF treatment may have higher expression of G-CSF receptors by lymphocyte CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells, which in turn may exert stronger effects on regulating T cells and elevating lymphocytes through G-CSF receptors.\nClinically, the commonly used dose of PEG-rhG-CSF for subcutaneous injection is 6 mg per cycle. If the body weight of patients is less than 45 kg or if the patients have a \u201cwhite blood cell-like reaction\u201d (white blood cells > 50 \u00d7 109/L and neutrophils > 20 \u00d7 109/L), the dose of PEGrhG-CSF for subcutaneous injection can be adjusted to 3 mg per cycle [13]. In primary-care hospitals, PEG-rhGCSF at 3 mg per cycle can also be used because of high cost of the drug. Therefore, this study analyzed the 6mg group and the 3 mg group separately. The results showed that the 66 patients in the PEG-rhG-CSF 6mg subgroup showed statistically significant changes in white blood cell count and lymphocyte count before and after\ntreatment, and the two were positively correlated with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.34, P = 0.002. The 22 patients in the PEG-rhG-CSF 3mg subgroup showed statistically significant changes in lymphocyte count and white blood cell count before and after treatment. However, there was no correlation between the changes in white blood cell count and lymphocyte count before and after treatment in the 3 mg subgroup. This may be caused by the small number of samples in the 3 mg subgroup. It should be further clarified in future studies by increasing the sample size.\nIn recent years, immunotherapy using programmed death factor-1 (PD-1) antibodies and chimeric receptor lymphocytes, for example, have been widely used as first-line class IA and recommended drugs for advanced lung cancer, esophageal cancer, and other solid tumors [14\u201316]. Despite longer overall survival, the overall response rate of immunotherapy is still low, only 10\u201320%, and the problem of primary and secondary drug resistance has been difficult to be solved [17,18].\nThere are many theories on the mechanism of poor efficacy and drug resistance of immunotherapy. Some scholars consider that the internal factors of tumor cells (such as activation of driver genes and inactivation of oncogenes) and external factors may lead to drug resistance [19]. In addition, there are other factors that affect the efficacy of immunotherapy, including the decrease of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, the low expression of PDL1, and the decrease in absolute value of lymphocytes [20].\nLong-term stimulation by tumor antigens can cause T cells to gradually lose their original ability to recognize antigens, activate and proliferate, or secrete interleukin-2, leading to T cell depletion [21]. The immune microenvironment and the distribution of immune cells in peripheral blood are important markers of immune status. A study has found that there were more CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and PD-1+ T cells in the peripheral blood of lung adenocarcinoma patients with long-term survival, indicating that the infiltration degree of immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment is closely related to long-term survival [22]. The distribution of peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations can be used as a prognostic indicator for tumor patients [23]. Understanding and improving the immune status of patients with malignant tumors, increasing the number of lymphocytes, reversing the depletion of lymphocytes, and changing the immune microenvironment are of great significance for improving the effect of immunotherapy.\nIn order to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy, some new combination immunotherapy models have been proposed, including immunotherapy combined with radiotherapy and double immunotherapy [24\u201326]. Our study\nconfirmed that PEG-rhG-CSF could increase the number of lymphocytes in patients with malignant tumors. Immunotherapy combined with PEG-rhG-CSF may serve as a new mode of combined immunotherapy. On the one hand, PEG-rhG-CSF, as the primary or secondary prevention of agranulocytosis, can prevent agranulocytosis and FN and ensure smooth treatment. On the other hand, by increasing the number of lymphocytes, we may reverse the depletion of lymphocytes, improve the efficacy of immunotherapy, and reduce the occurrence of drug resistance.\nThe following were the limitations of this study: 1) although the sample size was large, the selective bias and recall bias of data selection were high; 2) the disease types of the study population were heterogeneous; 3) this study did not perform further detailed analysis of lymphocyte subgroups and did not conduct a T-cell antigen receptor group library study; and 4) follow-up study was not performed. Further prospective studies with specific tumor type and detailed analysis of lymphocyte subgroups (such as CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, NK cells, B cells, etc.) are needed."
