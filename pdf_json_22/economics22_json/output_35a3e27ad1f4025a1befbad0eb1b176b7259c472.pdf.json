            "text": "Thank you for giving an opportunity to revise our paper entitled \"Initial Survey Validation for the Impact of Intellectual Capital on Frugal Innovation\". Response and corrections made are as attached.\nWe have revised to the best of our knowledge and addressed all reviews. We thank you again for this opportunity and looking forward to receive favourable reply.\nThank You.\nYours Faithfully\nAuthors\nMagiswary Dorasamy\nJayamalathi Jayabalan\nMurali Raman\nResponses to Review:\nSection Reviewers and Comments Response\nReviewer 1 Format The writing format is\ninconsistent between pages, and does not conform to the IJTech format. Must be rewritten and conform to the IJTech format.\nThank you for the comment.\nThe font used must be consistent, and conform to the IJTech format. The fonts used in Table 5 are different.\nThank you for the comment. We have corrected the paper with correct formatting.\nThe writing of this paper is very disorganized, making it difficult to read. Why is subsection 4.3 written in bold? In sub-section 4.3 why is there 1.1 Descriptive Analysis? If it will only contain 1 subsub-section, there is no need to write it like that, unless it will consist of more than one sub-sub-section.\nApologies for the oversight. We have corrected the subsections and flow of the numbering. We have removed the sub-sub sections.\nGeneral You must read and learn to write a good paper, so that\nyour paper can be accepted in a good journal.\nThis paper only contains descriptive of the respondents and the results of the questionnaire reliability test. No analysis at all, let alone novelty.\nThank you for the comment. We have added more content page 13 to give detail discussions.\nIt should be rewritten to show the analysis, and also the novelty of this paper should be explained clearly.\nReviewer 2 Introduction You should explain \"frugal\ninnovation\" better in order to\nbetter understanding to your\nresearch\nThank you for the comment. We have added more explanation for frugal innovation.\nMethodology\nThe methodology should be\nexplained more systematic\nThank you for your comment. We have improved this section now.\nGeneral This paper is interesting but it\nshould be followed by the scientific writing and appropriate methodology\nThank you for your comment. We have improved the paper further."
