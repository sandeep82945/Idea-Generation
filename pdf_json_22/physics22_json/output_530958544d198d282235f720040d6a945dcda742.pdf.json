    "abstractText": "Magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles were successfully prepared by a co-precipitation method. Rietveld refinement on the X-ray diffraction pattern confirmed the development of a single-phase cubic spinel structure with space group Fd 3m. However, Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy suggested the presence of Fe and Fe (mixed Fe and Fe) ions at the tetrahedral and octahedral sites of the inverse spinel structure, respectively. Impedance spectroscopy measurements showed a discontinues variation in the temperature dependence of the sample's resistive behavior, indicating the appearance of semiconductor\u2013metal\u2013semiconductor like transitions between the temperature range of 293 and 373 K. A similar dual transition was also observed from the dielectric and conductivity measurements around the same temperature regions. The observed unusual transition is explained in term of the competitive effects among the hopping of localized/delocalized and short-range/long-range charge carriers present in the sample. Moreover, the prepared sample exhibits colossal dielectric permittivity ( 10), reduced tangent loss ( 0.2) and moderate conductivity (>10 6 S cm ) values, making Fe3O4 nanoparticles a potential candidate for electromagnetic absorbing materials.",

            "text": "Magnetite (Fe3O4) is a well-known ferrimagnetic material having an inverse spinel cubic structure with a space group of Fd 3m. In the inverse spinel structure, 1/3 of the Fe ions are located in the tetrahedral (A) sites as Fe3+ while the rest are located in octahedral (B) sites as Fe2.5+ in a closely packed array of oxygen atoms.1 Th ferrimagnetic nature is caused by the ferromagnetic sub-lattices (A- and B-sites) and their mutual antiferromagnetic interaction. Fe3O4 has the highest value of magnetization, i.e., M \u00bc 4.2 mB below the Curie temperature (Tc \u00bc 850 K) and electrically is a good semiconducting material at room temperature and above.1,2 However, on decreasing the temperature, the semiconducting behavior of Fe3O4 changed into metallic character along with a decrease in the conductivity by two orders of magnitude due to a structural phase transition from cubic to monoclinic and charge-orbital ordering.3 This unusual transition usually occurs at Tv z 120 K and is termed\nhysics, Air University, PAF Complex E-9, oo.com , Directorate of Science, PINSTECH, P.O.\nrsity of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran,\ns in Energy (USPCAS-E), NUST, H-12,\nfor his contributions to the eld of\n354\na Verwey transition; however, this Verwey transition temperature (Tv) is found to be quite sensitive to the stoichiometry of the constituents in Fe3O4.4 Although, the Verwey transition has a low operating temperature for most of the practical applications, it plays a vital role in the importance of iron based materials (ferrites) due to their promising applications in spintronics and nano-electronic switching devices.5\nIn the last decade, efforts have been made to alter such unusual semiconductor to metal like conductivity transition in Fe3O4 derived compounds (MFe2O4; where M is transitionmetal ions) at higher temperature without changing the crystal symmetry for the novel microwave switching applications in communication and sensing. The fundamental requirements for such applications are the creation of so ferrimagnetic characteristics at room temperature, high electrical conductivity, reduced eddy current loss, and chemical stability.6 Several studies have been published on the magnetic and electrical properties of different Fe3O4 derived compounds such as CoFe2O4,7 MnFe2O4,8 Co1.25Fe1.75O4,9 Ni1 xZnxFe2O4,10 Mg0.5Co0.5Fe2O4,11 and Ni0.4Cu0.2Zn0.4Fe2 xDyxO4 spinel ferrite nanoparticles.12 From these studies, we found that the magnetic exchange interactions and charge carriers hopping mechanism in these ferrites are considerably inuenced by the cation distribution, surface spin structure, interparticle interactions, magnetocrystalline anisotropy and surface morphology. However, to understand the mechanism of semiconductor to metal transition (SMT) at higher temperature in the spinel ferrites, different concepts have been presented.

Later, Bhowmik et al. reported a dual transition in Ni1.5Fe1.5O4 ferrite, where they found a semiconductor to metal transition (SMT) at around 373 K; however, on further increase in temperature, system returned back from metallic to semiconductor transition (MST) at around 413 K.16 They revealed that hopping of localized and long-range charge carriers governs the semiconducting behavior at low and high temperatures, respectively. While, the occurrence of metal-like behavior in the middle temperature region could be attributed to the hidden charge conduction phase which could be manifested depending on the coupling among the ferromagnetic spin order and electronic states along with the reconguration of charge carrier's conduction mechanism in the system. Similarly, O\u0308zdemir et al. conrmed a semiconductor\u2013metal\u2013semiconductor transition in pure CuFe2O4 and CuO/CuFe2O4 nanocomposites by impedance spectroscopy.17 According to them, a metallic conduction is formed as a result of the delocalization of localized states and the formation of conducting channels. Moreover, the addition of CuO nanoparticles decreased the temperature at which metallic conductivity could be observed, which might be due to the composites' reduced cation and anion content. So far, none of the above-mentioned report obtained such unusual semiconductor\u2013metal\u2013semiconductor transition in other spinel ferrites. Moreover, the effects of cation distribution on the conduction mechanism along with the existence of metal like behavior between the two semiconductor states still need attention. Thus, in the present study, it was proposed to investigate the conductivity and dielectric properties of the nanostructured Fe3O4 at higher temperatures (i.e., well above the Verwey transition temperature) for the probable occurrence of such type of transitions in the inverse spinel system.\nIn this work, Fe3O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by a coprecipitation method and then investigated for their structural and magnetic properties along with the impedance spectroscopy measurements as a function of frequency (0.5\u2013107 Hz) and temperature (293\u2013373 K). Our impedance results conrmed the presence of semiconductor\u2013metal\u2013semiconductor transition in the prepared sample and also exhibited a colossal dielectric permittivity, reduced tangent loss and dissimilar conduction mechanism governed at high and low temperatures which make this material applicable for different technological applications.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

Then, both solutions were mixed together in a beaker placed on a hot plate at 75 C for 1 h. Aer an hour of stirring, ammonia (NH3) was added dropwise in the mixed solution until brownish solution turned into blackish. The sample was kept on the hot plate for further 1 h under same temperature and stirring conditions. Aerward, the beaker was moved from the hot plate and allowed to cool down to room temperature. The sample was then washedmultiple times with deionized water and once with ethanol, and placed in a vacuum oven for 24 h at 70 C for drying. Lastly, the dried powder was ground and compacted in the form of pellet by applying a pressure of 5 ton per cm2 using hydraulic press and then sintered at 200 C for 5 h.\nStructural characterization was performed using X-ray diffractometer (ARL EQUINOX 3000) with CuKa X-ray source (l\u00bc 1.54 A\u030a). The experimental XRD data was tted with Rietveld renement using FullProf soware. The morphology of the prepared Fe3O4 nanoparticles was analyzed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) using a JEOL JEM-2100F. Elemental analysis was conducted using scanning electron microscopy (VEGA3, TESCAN) equipped with an EDX detector (Oxford Instruments). At room temperature, the 57Fe Mo\u0308ssbauer spectrum of the ground powder was collected at room temperature using 57Co in Rh-matrix source in the transmission geometry. The Mo\u0308ssbauer data were tted by assuming that all peaks were Lorentzian in shape. Magnetic measurements were made using a Quantum Design Inc. vibrating sample magnetometer (PPMSVSM). To measure electrical/dielectric properties, the pelletized sample was connected on a probe with copper wires and silver paint. The probe was then connected to dielectric analyzer (Novocontrol Alpha N-Analyzer), which was connected to a computer through fully automated soware WINDETA, which calculated different electrical parameters while varying the temperature via a resistive lament mounted inside the probe."

The sextet with lower isomer shi (IS) is attributed to the tetrahedral (A) site, which contains only Fe3+ ions while the other three sextets are believed to be due to the octahedral (B) site, which corresponds to the random distribution of both Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions. The comparatively larger IS corresponding to the Fe ions are attributed to an effectivemean charge of +2.5 at the Bsite. This usually happens due to fast charge transfer transition between the Fe3+\u2013Fe2+ centers at the same crystallographic site, which causes delocalization of spin electrons by super-exchange mechanism.20 Furthermore, in nanoparticles the surface layers are more active and have a strong effect on the cationic distribution. Due to these hopping and surface effects, the structural formula for Fe3O4 can be written as [Fe 3+]A[Fe2 x 2.5+Fex 3+]BO4 2 instead of [Fe3+]A[Fe 3+Fe2+]BO4\n2 .21 Moreover, the emergence of a sextet veries the magnetic behavior of the sample at room temperature while the doublet is assumed to be related to the nanoparticle's super-paramagnetic nature.\nQuadrupole splitting (QS) is another critical Mo\u0308ssbauer parameter for dening the asymmetry of the charge distribution surrounding Fe ions. The strength of the quadrupole interaction is determined by the electric eld gradient (EFG) generated by the nucleus's s-electron density. The EFG at the B-site could be a result of the nearest neighbours' deformed octahedral geometry, which results in a non-spherical charge distribution.21 While, the negative QS values may be attributed to the Fe ion's oblate charge distribution.22 It can be observed from Table 2 that the sign of QS changes from Fe3+ to Fe2.5+ in the octahedral B-site, which conrms a charge re-distribution by the surface modication of Fe3O4.\nThe cation distribution among the A- and B-sites may be determined using the area and intensity of the 2nd and 5th peaks in the normalized Mo\u0308ssbauer data, which are listed in Table 2. It can be observed that the tetrahedral A-site consists of about 32% of trivalent Fe ions and the B-site consists of a mixture of about 11% of trivalent and 45% of divalent Fe ions, while, some 9% of Fe3+ ions reside on the surface. For stoichiometric magnetite, the area ratio of A-site to the B-site remains 0.5. However, in this study, we found that the area ratio of A-site to B-site comes out to be 0.567, which is slightly higher than a perfect stoichiometry. This usually happens due to the strong contribution of the surface layers, which has been observed from the Mo\u0308ssbauer data analysis. Hence, the stoichiometry of the Fe3O4 sample can be written based on Mo\u0308ssbauer data as follows:\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle . P\nub lis\nhe d\non 2\n5 A\npr il\n20 22\n.

The ZFC curve exhibits a broad peak with a maximum at TB \u00bc 122 K, corresponding to the average blocking temperature (TB) of nanoparticles. Above TB, the thermal stimulation energy overcomes the anisotropy energy barrier, causing the spins of the nanoparticles to oscillate between their two easy axis directions.23 However, the overlapping of ZFC and FC curves above TB species the presence of certain particle size distribution and/or interparticle interactions in the prepared nanoparticles (see Fig. 2(a)).23 Fig. 4(b) shows the hysteresis loop (M\u2013H) of the prepared nanoparticles which was measured by applying a magnetic eld of 20 kOe at room temperature.

Arrows in the impedance plane plot represents the increasing direction of frequency. Two semicircular arcs are clearly observed for the temperature range from 293 K to 333 K (see Fig. 5(a)); however, above 333 K, a single semicircular arc is only visible (see Fig. 5(b)). Here, the presence of different semicircular arcs represents different electro-active regions arise from the contribution of grains (Gs), grain boundaries (GBs) and/or electrode effect (Es) having dissimilar relaxation times.15 The intercept of these semicircular arcs at x-axis provides the total resistance of the sample. It can be seen from the gure that the diameter of the semicircular arcs reduces with increasing temperature and displays its minima around 313 K. With further increase in temperature, the diameter of the semicircular arcs begins to increase and shows its maxima around 343 K (see Fig. 5(a)). However, beyond 343 K, the diameter of semicircular arc begins to decrease again with increasing temperature (see Fig. 5(b)). Here, the temperatures at which the diameter of the semicircular arcs is minimum and maximum are labeled as semiconductor to metal (SMT) and metal to semiconductor (MST) like transition temperatures, respectively. To obtain a better understanding of these relaxation processes, we have tted our experimental data with different equivalent circuit models involving a series and parallel combinations of resistance (R), capacitance (C), and constant phase element (Q) using ZView soware. Generally, the constant phase element (CPE) is a deviation from the actual capacitative behavior indicating the presence of more than one relaxation phenomena with same relaxation time. The capacitance of CPE is calculated using the relation:\nC \u00bc Q1n R\n1 n n\n(1)\nwhere n represents the dispersion parameter and the value of n is 1 for ideal capacitor and 0 for ideal resistor.15 Fig. 5(c and d) shows the tting of experimental data recorded at 303 K using the equivalent circuits as shown in the insets of these gures along with their corresponding residuals.

Since, the series combination of RC circuits with CPE is typically a representation of grains (Gs), grain boundaries (GBs), and electrode effect, which is not suitable here due to the poor quality of t (see inset of Fig. 5(c)). However, the other combination of (R1\u2013C1\u2013CPE1)(R2\u2013 CPE2), as shown in Fig. 5(d), is found to be a good representation of the typical bulk impedance response with different ionic/electronic hopping conductors.26 Therefore, based on the obtained minimum residual value and good t, we have tted the obtained complex plane plots at different temperatures (293\u2013373 K) using an equivalent circuit model of (R1\u2013C1\u2013 CPE1)(R2\u2013CPE2), as shown in Fig. 5(d). The estimated values of the tting parameters for each temperature are listed in Table 3.

Beyond 333 K, we have tted the obtained data using a parallel combination of R1\u2013C1\u2013CPE1 equivalent circuit model. We found that these single semicircular arcs have parameters comparable to the geometrical capacitance for Gs; therefore, these single semicircular arcs are attributed to the contribution of Gs.\nFig. 6 shows the variations in the resistance of grains (Gs) and electrode effect (Es) with temperature for the prepared nanoparticles.

Above 313 K, an increasing trend in the Gs resistance is visible up to 343 K, which exhibits a metal-like behavior. However, the Es and RT resistance still show decreasing trends which might be due to increase in the mobility and decrease in the density of the hopping carriers with temperature.

Moreover, below the Curie temperature, the presence of cations of the same elements with distinct valence states result in the metallic nature.15 In the present study, the coexistence of Fe3+ and Fe2+ are found to exist in the prepared nanoparticles, as inferred from the Mo\u0308ssbauer measurements. The electrostatic interaction among these different ionic states of metal ions (i.e., cation\u2013anion\u2013cation) causes a formation of relatively less stable doubly degenerate eg electrons and more stable triply degenerate t2g electrons.28 Therefore, to understand the observed semiconductor to metal (SMT) and metal to semiconductor (MST) like transitions at different temperatures, it is necessary to consider the energy of eg electrons as well as the potential for oxygen vacancies. For this, let Ek be the energy of the carriers participating in hopping (i.e., eg electrons), n be the number density of eg electrons, and f be the potential of the oxygen vacancy.

Thus, the hopping probability of eg electrons between Fe\n3+\u2013O\u2013Fe3+ network at the B-site increases with increasing temperature up to 313 K, which in turn reduces the resistance of the sample and displays the semiconducting behavior. Above 313 K, the efficient conducting channels begin to appear with further increase in temperature, causing the delocalization of charges and alignment of surface/ core spins which satises the condition Ek > ef. These conducting channels in the form of Fe3+\u2013Fe2+ network facilitate the electron hopping thereby increasing the mobility of charge carriers and we observe a metal-like behavior up to 343 K. However, above 343 K, the hopping probability of eg electrons increases again due to increase in the conductivity caused by the un-trapped delocalized charges, which represent the recurrence of semiconducting behavior.\nTo better understand into whether the relaxation process is dominated by short-range or long-range charge carrier movement, Fig. 7(a\u2013c) compares the normalized plots of the imaginary part of modulus (M00) and impedance (Z00) as a function of frequency for various representative temperatures. It can be seen from the gure that, within the available frequency window, only one peak is visible in both components of normalizedM00 and Z00 at higher frequency region. At 303 K (lowtemperature semiconducting regime), a distinct mismatch between the two peaks is observed, indicating that charge carriers are localized and that the relaxation process is governed by short-rangemobility of charge carriers.30 With the increase in temperature, the observed mismatch between the two peaks decreases at 323 K (intermediate-temperature metal-like regime) which suggests that the conduction process become less localized and translated to long-range mobility of charge carriers (see Fig. 7(b)). However, with increasing temperature, the mismatch between the M00 and Z00 becomes nearly same at 363 K (high-temperature semiconducting regime) as shown in Fig. 7(c), indicating the relaxation process is dominated by the long-range movement of charge carriers.30 Hence, the increase\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The obtained tted parameters at different temperatures are tabulated in Table 3. The temperature-dependent dc conductivity (sdc) behavior in Fig. 8(b) shows three thermal activated conductivity regions. The sdc curves transform from semiconductor behavior (region-I: increase of sdc) to metal-like behavior (region-II: decrease of sdc) at T \u00bc 313 K with increasing temperature. Aerward, with the further increase in temperature, the metal-like behavior is transformed into second semiconductor behavior (region-III: increase of sdc) above T \u00bc 343 K. Here, the observed metal-like behavior in the prepared sample is not considered as a real metallic behavior because of the fact that the sac behavior of the prepared sample follows the Jonscher's power law.9 Thus, the observed metal-like behavior (region-II) at intermediate temperature range (313\u2013343 K) might be due to the presence of trapped conducting charge carriers, which can be evident from the correlation among the disordered surface spins and electronic trap centers at the Bsites. Moreover, in the semiconducting regions (i.e., region-I & III), the linear trends of sdc obey Arrhenius equation as follows:\nsdc \u00bc so exp( Ea/kBT) (4)\nwhere so is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, KB is the Boltzmann's constant and T is the absolute temperature.32 The activation energies (Ea) are found to be 0.262 eV and 1.019 eV in region-I and region-III, respectively. Here, the obtained values of Ea suggest the dominance of hopping of electrons and hole hopping process along with polaron conduction at the low- and high-temperature regimes, respectively.17 Hence, the activation energies estimated for the prepared sample predict both hopping and polaronic conductionmechanisms among the localized sites. Moreover, the inset of Fig. 8(b) displays the variation of slope exponent (n) with temperature. It can be seen that the value of n decreases with increasing temperature up to 323 K and then it begins to increase. Here, the minimum value of n is obtained in the intermediate temperature region (region-II) which might be associated to the charge carrier's delocalized character in comparison to charge localization at low (region-I)\n12352 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 12344\u201312354\nand high (region-III) temperatures. However, the observed variation in n(T) reveals that charge conduction in the prepared sample is governed by the overlapping large polaron tunneling (OLPT) mechanism.33"

            "text": "Fig. 9(a) shows the behavior of real part of dielectric permittivity (30) measured at different temperatures. The graph shows the typical permittivity vs. frequency pattern where dielectric permittivity values are higher at low frequency region and decreases as frequency increases at all temperatures and displays a constant behavior at higher frequencies. Dispersion in dielectric values could be understood using Maxwell\u2013Wagner polarization model in accordance with Koop's theory.34,35 It is proposed that ferrites are composed of conducting Gs, separated by resistive GBs. At low frequencies, charges transport via Gs to GBs and creating a local lattice distortion by asymmetric charge distribution which moves along the applied eld.36 Such type of polarization is known as space charge polarization. But, as frequency increases, this slowly moving lattice distortion (space charge polarization) cannot follow the higher applied eld and lag behind, resulting in the decrease of dielectric permittivity values with the increase in frequency. Moreover, the value of dielectric permittivity initially increases as temperature rises to 313 K due to thermally activated dipoles, increasing the electron exchange interaction which results in the increase of dielectric permittivity. Here, the obtained value of dielectric permittivity at room temperature is found to be comparatively higher than the reported ones.37\u201340 The reason for such a high dielectric permittivity is that the prepared sample has electrical inhomogeneity caused by the Gs and GBs effect. Above 313 K, a decrease in the value of dielectric permittivity is observed due to the delocalization of conducting channels. However, above 343 K, the value of dielectric permittivity begins to increase again due to the oxygen ion hopping at relatively higher temperatures, supporting our earlier MST discussion.\nFig. 9(b) shows the variation of dielectric tangent loss (tan d) vs. frequency for the prepared Fe3O4 nanoparticles measured at\nctric tangent loss with frequency measured at different temperatures. ielectric tangent loss at low and high frequency regimes, respectively.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

It can be seen that, for all temperatures, the value of tangent loss decreases with increasing frequency followed by a peak behavior appearing in the frequency range of 102 to 103 Hz. This peak behavior usually appears when hopping frequency matches the frequency of external applied eld.41 Moreover, it can be seen from the gure that the tan d plot exhibit two distinct features. At low frequency region (0.5\u2013103 Hz), the tan d values increase linearly with temperature as indicated by arrow-head. The electrode effect is predominant in our sample at low frequency up to 343 K and then vanished at higher temperatures, as discussed in the impedance section. Therefore, an increasing value of tan d in the low frequency region might be due to the fact that energy is consumed in overcoming the electrode effect. However, the increasing trend of tan d values above 343 K is explained by a dri of surface-spins and appearance of increased conductive channels. While, at high frequency region (103\u2013107 Hz), one can see from the inset of gure that the value of tan d initially increases as temperature rises up to 313 K. This observed increase in tan d is accredited to the increase in thermally activated charge carriers showing the semiconducting behavior, as discussed earlier. However, above 313 K (i.e., SMT temperature), the tan d value is found to decrease due to the delocalization of charge carriers. Since, themovement or ipping of delocalized conductive channels with AC-eld is easier; therefore, less energy is dissipated which results in the decrease of tan d values till 343 K. Aerwards, the value of tan d begins to increase again with temperature which is explained by the increased conductivity values at high temperatures. Here, the obtained values of tan d for the prepared sample are <0.18 at high frequencies (107 Hz) and found to be comparatively small in comparison to the literature values.37,38 Hence, the reduced value of tan d for the prepared sample along with a high dielectric permittivity making these sample interesting for the electromagnetic absorbing material."

Moreover, we found that both short-range and long-range movements of charge carriers governs the conduction process in the sample. While the presence of metal-like behavior at intermediate temperature could be a result of the semiconductor state transitioning from short-range to long-range conduction at low and high temperatures, respectively.
