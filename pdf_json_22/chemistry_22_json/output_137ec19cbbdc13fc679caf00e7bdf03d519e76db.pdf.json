superhydrophobic surfaces, superoleophobic surfaces, and slippery liquid-infused surfaces, have drawn keen research interest from the communities engaged in chemical synthesis, interfacial chemistry, surface engineering, bionic manufacturing and micro-nano machining. This is due to their great potential applications in liquid-proofing, self-cleaning, chemical resistance, anti-icing, water/oil remediation, biomedicine, etc. However, poor robustness and durability that notably hinders the real-world applications of such surfaces remains their Achilles heel. The past few years have witnessed rapidly increasing publications that address the robustness and durability of liquid-repellent surfaces, and many breakthroughs have been achieved. This review provides an overview of the recent progress made towards robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces. First, we discuss the wetting of solid surface and its generally-adopted characterisation methods, and introduce typical liquid-repellent surfaces. Second, we focus on various evaluation methods of the robustness and durability of liquid-repellent surfaces. Third, the recent advances in design and fabrication of robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces are reviewed in detail. Fourth, we present the applications where these surfaces have been employed in fields like chemistry, engineering, biology and in daily life. Finally, we discuss the possible research perspectives in robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces. By presenting such state-of-the-art of this significant and fast-developing area, we believe that this review will inspire multidisciplinary scientific communities and industrial circles to develop novel liquid-repellent surfaces that can meet the requirements of various real-world applications."

            "heading": "1 Introduction",
            "text": "Wetting, referring to the process of making contact between a liquid and a solid (or liquid) surface, is a ubiquitous phenomenon that exists in our daily life, industry, agriculture, biology, etc., from raindrops on a car windshield to drastic shape transition of living tissues.1-8 Wetting shows a range of curious, yet useful behaviors which make the fields concerned with their study intrinsically multidisciplinary, spanning across several areas of chemistry, biology, physics, engineering, etc. Since the introduction of Young\u2019s equation in 1805,9 research on wetting and wettability has continued for over two hundred years. As an important and fascinating subfield of wetting, non-wettable surfaces, which are also termed as liquid-repellent surfaces, have drawn keen yet continuously increasing interests from both academic and industrial communities.10-14 Upon the discovery of the underlying mechanism (i.e., rough structures and low surface energy) of the self-cleaning and super water repellence of Lotus leaf,15,16 superhydrophobic surfaces became the earliest research focus for the topic of liquid repellence. Subsequently, the key structural feature (i.e., re-entrant microstructures) of super oil-repellent surfaces was revealed,17 and the natural oil-repellence of the cuticle of springtail was also discovered,18 both of which boosted the development of superoleophobic surfaces in air. Later, the fish scale was demonstrated to be super oil-repellent underwater due to its superhydrophilicity in air,19 which introduced underwater superoleophobicity to the family of super liquid-repellent surface. Moreover, a novel Nepenthes pitcher plant-inspired slippery\nliquid-/lubricant-infused surface (SLIS) with excellent non-wettable performance (e.g., negligible contact angle hysteresis and low sliding angles) was reported in 2011,20 which further broadened the research scope of liquid-repellent surfaces. During the last 20 years, much attention has been paid on superhydrophobic surfaces, superoleophobic surfaces (both in air and underwater), and SLISs, and plentiful and significant achievements on these liquid-repellent surfaces have been obtained. As depicted in Fig. 1, when searching the topic of \u201csuperhydrophobi*, superoleophobi* or slippery l*-infused surface\u201d in the Web of Science, significant numbers of research articles and reviews could be indexed, which showed a rapid increase most years. Recently, the topic of \u201csuperwettability\u201d was selected as one of the 2021 Top Ten Emerging Technologies in Chemistry released by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).21 Based on the comprehensive and in-depth study of the anti-wetting property of liquid-repellent surfaces, diverse potential applications have been explored and verified especially at a lab-scale, such as self-cleaning,22 drag reduction,23 oily wastewater remediation,24,25 liquid/gas manipulation,26-28 anti-icing,29,30 anti-fouling/-corrosion,31,32 enhanced heat transfer,33-35 energy harvesting/conversion,36,37 and biomedical engineering,38-41 just to name a few.\nAlthough tremendous progress has been made on the research of these liquid-repellent surfaces, the realization of their real-world applications and industrializations remains challenging. This mainly originates from the poor robustness and durability of the liquid-repellent surfaces.14,42-45 Firstly, it is well known that the liquid repellence of superhydrophobic and superoleophobic surfaces is attributed to the locked air cushion within the rough structures, and that of SLIS originates from the infused lubricant layer, both of which are thermodynamically unstable under some conditions, such as long-term immersion in the repelling liquid, vapor condensation, increased hydraulic pressure, etc. As a result, the super-liquid-repellent surfaces change their wetting from the Cassie-Baxter to the Wenzel state due to the\nlost air cushion, while the SLIS suffers from the depletion of infused lubricant, thus rendering the loss of liquid repellence. Secondly, micro/nanoscale rough structures and special surface chemistry are generally two essential factors of liquid-repellent surfaces, but these features (especially the rough surface textures) are intrinsically fragile and thereby are highly susceptible to mechanical abrasion, dynamic impacting, peeling, etc., since the local pressure applied on the surface textures is high even when the corresponding mechanical loading is small. Mechanical damage of surface architectures and/or surface chemistry always results in the deterioration of the liquid repellence. Lastly, when liquid-repellent surfaces are exposed to chemically active conditions, such as being immersed in corrosive aqueous solutions, exposed to UV, or treated by plasma, etc., chemical processes often occur on the surfaces either slowly or rapidly, which may change their surface textures and/or surface chemistry, leading to the loss of their liquid repellence. Therefore, extensive efforts have been made to address the robustness and durability of liquid-repellent surfaces in recent years. As shown in Fig. 1, when the topics of \u201crobust or durable\u201d and \u201csuperhydrophobi*, superoleophobi* or slippery l*-infused surface\u201d were used to search the publications in the Web of Science, a large number of research articles and reviews could also be found, and the number of these papers increased annually, but its relative proportion was less than a quarter of the publications of liquid-repellent surfaces, indicating that plenty of room exists for the study of robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces.\nTo improve the robustness and durability of artificial liquid-repellent surfaces, various strategies have been proposed to address the thermodynamic durability, mechanical durability, chemical durability, or several aspects of them. First of all, the matrix and surface chemistry should be considered, for example, abrasion-tolerant substrates could partially improve the mechanical durability of liquid-repellent surfaces,46,47 while carbon-fluorine-based surface agents usually generate better chemical durability than carbon-hydrogen-based groups.48 Next, various special surface textures, such as re-entrant microstructures,49,50 densely and closely packed nanostructures,51 self-similar rough structures,52 hierarchical micro/nano structures,53 etc., have been designed to enhance the robustness and durability of liquid-repellent surfaces from different aspects. For those substrates covered with liquid-repellent coatings, increasing the bonding strength among them is a universal and effective strategy.54 In addition, imparting liquid-repellent surfaces with self-healing property, such as restorable microstructure, self-healable surface chemistry, or both, is another alternative method to improve their durability.55,56 Moreover, selective combination of the proposed strategies have been recently demonstrated to be more effective in further improving the robustness and durability of liquid-repellent surfaces,47,57-59 which should be a promising solution for moving liquid-repellent surfaces towards real-world applications.\nThis review provides an overview of recent progress towards robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces and lays foundation for further in-depth research of this topic. Fig. 2 schematically illustrates the main context of this review, including the robustness and durability of liquid-repellent surfaces, the recently proposed design and fabrication strategies for robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces, as well as their emerging applications. Specifically, the wetting of solid surface in both air and liquid and the common\nwettability characterisation methods will be discussed, followed by a brief summary of typical liquid-repellent surfaces, including superhydrophobic, superoleophobic and SLISs (Section 2). After introducing the thermodynamic, mechanical and chemical durability of liquid-repellent surfaces, as well as their general evaluation methods (Section 3), we will present a detailed discussion of recent progress on the design and fabrication of robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces (Section 4). Then we briefly discuss several applications of robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces, such as protection of solid substrate, liquid/gas harvesting/transport/manipulation, immiscible liquids separation, electricity generation, and enhanced heat transfer (Section 5). Finally, we draw conclusions and propose possible research perspectives in robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces (Section 6). This review will draw great attention from researchers engaged in functional surfaces fabrication, especially those in chemical synthesis, interfacial chemistry, surface engineering, bionic manufacturing, micro-nano machining, etc. Moreover, this review may appeal to those communities that are devoted to promoting commercial applications of liquid-repellent surfaces towards our daily lives."

            "text": "When the wetting of a solid surface occurs in air, a triple-phase interface consisting of solid, gas (i.e., air) and liquid is built, and a CA, \u03b8, which is defined as the angle between the tangent to the liquid-gas interface and the solid surface at the three-phase contact line can be observed, as shown in Fig. 3a. The CA is an indication of how likely the surface is to be wetted by the liquid: low CA means a tendency of the liquid to spread and adhere to the surface, whereas high CA suggests the liquid-repellent tendency of the surface. In 1805, Young first described the CA of an ideal solid surface (i.e., one that is atomically smooth, chemically homogeneous, nonreactive and nondeformable by the liquid or gas) by proposing the Young\u2019s model, as depicted in Fig. 3a.9 For an ideal solid surface wetted by a liquid droplet, the formed CA depends only on the physico-chemical nature (i.e., the surface tension) of the three phases and is independent of both the system geometry and gravity, which is expressed by the Young\u2019s equation:\nSV SL LV Y= + cos    (1)\nwhere \u03b3 is the surface tension (or surface free energy) and the subscripts SV, SL and LV respectively refer to the solid-vapor, solid-liquid and liquid-vapor interfaces; \u03b8Y is the intrinsic CA, or Young CA, of the liquid droplet on the solid surface. This equation was justified as the result of an equilibrium of forces at\nthat time, and the \u201cup\u201d component, LV Ysin  , was balanced by the strain field existing near the\nthree-phase contact line in the solid.60,61\nFrom the point of thermodynamics, the Gibbs free energy, G, of the solid-liquid-gas system can be\nwritten as76:\nSL SL SV SV LV LV= + +G A A A   (2)\nwhere A is the contact interface area. When the three-phase system achieved equilibrium state, G must be a minimum, that is, the thermodynamic derivation dG = 0. As shown in Fig. 3b, when the liquid-vapor interface slips freely at a certain inclination \u03b8I along the solid surface, the variation of the contact areas must meet the geometrical conditions of dASV = \u2212dASL and dALV = dASLcos\u03b8I. Then eqn (1) could be deduced thermodynamically, and the inclination \u03b8I is equal to \u03b8Y.\nHowever, ideal solid surfaces rarely exist, and real surfaces are usually topographically rough and chemically heterogeneous. For a topographically rough but chemically homogeneous solid surface, its actual (i.e., microscopic) surface is greater than its geometrical (i.e., apparent or macroscopic) surface by a coefficient r, the roughness factor introduced by Wenzel in 1936.77 In addition, the rough structures at solid-liquid contact area are supposed to be completely filled with the liquid (Fig. 3c). Therefore, the solid-liquid and solid-vapor contact interfacial area (i.e., ASL and ASV, respectively) should be mathematically multiplied by the factor r, and the Gibbs free energy of the wetting system on such a rough solid surface, Gr, can be written as:\nSL SL SV SV LV LV= + +rG r A r A A   (3)\nThe minimum of Gr (dGr = 0) yields the well-known Wenzel equation: 77\nSV SL LV W= cosr r   + (4)\nwhere \u03b8W is the apparent CA in Wenzel model. Eqns (1) and (4) provide the relationship between \u03b8W and \u03b8Y:\nW Ycos = cosr  (5)\nSince r > 1 for a rough surface, eqns (4) and (5) clearly show that the surface roughness amplifies both wetting and non-wetting properties of a solid surface, depending on the intrinsic wettability (i.e., \u03b8Y) of the corresponding smooth surface. For a smooth surface with intrinsic CA < 90\u00b0, roughening enables it to become more wettable, while a surface with intrinsic CA > 90\u00b0 becomes more non-wettable when roughness is present. These tendencies are generally valid for a rough solid surface, but when r is made arbitrarily large (r >> 1), complete wetting (cos \u03b8W > 1) or complete drying (cos \u03b8W < \u22121) seems to be implied. However, such features could not be obtained because Wenzel\u2019s assumptions, such as the liquid completely wets the rough structures at the solid-liquid contact area and there is a single Gibbs free energy minimum, etc. are not satisfied.78,79 Additionally, one essential condition to approximate the stable CA by eqn (5) is employing sufficiently large droplet volume, which is supposed to be 102\u2013103 orders of magnitude compared to the roughness scale.78,80 The typical scale of a real solid surface roughness is in the range of nanometers to micrometers, so a liquid droplet with a volume of a few microliters (i.e., diameter in millimeter scale) may be sufficiently large for the estimation of \u03b8W.\nIn 1944, Cassie and Baxter investigated the wettability of rough porous surfaces by considering the trapped air in the microporous structures.81 When liquid wets a rough porous surface, the apparent solid-liquid contact interface is actually composed of microscopic solid-liquid interface and vapor-liquid interface (Fig. 3d), so it can be regarded as the wetting on a chemically heterogeneous surface. By taking surface chemical heterogeneities into consideration, the water CA of a rough solid surface could be described as:81\nC-B 1 Y 2cos = cosf f  \u2212 (6)\nwhere \u03b8C-B is the apparent CA in the Cassie-Baxter model, f1 and f2 are respectively the fractional area of the solid-liquid interface and the liquid-vapor interface (f1 + f2 = 1) in the composite contact interface. When the rough surface is completely wetted by water (i.e., no air is trapped and f2 = 0), eqn (6) reduces to Wenzel\u2019s equation (eqn (5)) for the apparent CA of a rough solid surface with the roughness factor of f1. The Cassie-Baxter model can be easily generalised to more complex solid-vapor-liquid wetting systems in which the rough solid surfaces show different surface chemistries. For a surface with n kinds of chemistries, the surface free energy of the solid-vapor and solid-liquid interfaces are:\nSV , SV SL , SL= , = n n i i i i\ni i\nf f     (7)\nwhere fi is the area fraction characterised by a given chemistry at domain i ( 1 n\ni\ni\nf = ), , SVi and , SLi\nare the surface free energy at domain i. Then the universal equation can be expressed as:\nC-Bcos = cos n i i\ni\nf  (8)\nwhere \u03b8i is the CA on the flat domain i with homogeneous chemistry. For liquid wetted rough surfaces\nwith two different surface chemistries (i.e., n = 2), eqn (8) becomes:\nC-B 1 1 2 2cos = cos cosf f  + (9)\nFor example, when a rough and chemically-homogeneous surface with trapped air is wetted by liquid, the actual surface chemistries for the liquid could be regarded as a composite chemistry of solid and air, and \u03b81 and \u03b82 respectively refers to the CAs on flat solid surface (i.e., \u03b81 = \u03b8Y) and air. Considering that the liquid CA on air is always equal to 180\u00b0 (i.e., cos\u03b82 = \u22121), eqn (9) could be rewritten as eqns (6) and (10):\nC-B 1 1cos = (cos 1) 1f  + \u2212 (10)\nMilne et al. reported that for a wetting system with a composite interface, eqn (6) could be used generally, whereas eqn (10) was only valid for the case of flat topped pillar structures without any liquid penetration, and its incorrect use in CA estimation would result in errors from ~ 3\u00b0 to 13\u00b0 for superhydrophobic surfaces.82\nIn a mixed wetting state, as described in Fig. 3e, a liquid droplet partially wets the side walls of asperities and partially sits on the trapped air pockets, it is also referred as the transition state from the Wenzel to the Cassie-Baxter state. The apparent CA (\u03b8mix) in such a mixed wetting state is described as:83,84\nmix 1 Y 1cos cos 1rf f = + \u2212 (11)"

            "text": "When a solid surface is covered with a layer of liquid or directly immersed in liquid, its wetting by another immiscible liquid will be different from that directly exposed to air, and the difference mainly focuses on the three phases and thus the contact interfaces in the wetting system. Notably, the interfacial tension between the two liquids should be positive, otherwise they will fully mix with each other.\n2.1.2.1 Solid surface covered with a layer of liquid. When a solid surface is covered with a thin layer of Liquid A, its wetting by another immiscible Liquid B in air is governed by the interfacial interactions between the four phases (solid, Liquid A, Liquid B, and the surrounding air) and by the geometry of the solid surface.85 Referring to the interfacial tensions of solid-Liquid A, Liquid A-vapor, Liquid A-Liquid B\nand Liquid B-vapor interfaces as ASL  , AL V  , A BL L  and BL V  , respectively, when eqn (12):\nA ASV SL L V\n( ) 0  \u2212 +  (12)\nis satisfied, Liquid A will keep infusing the solid surface despite the presence of Liquid B, and Liquid B will form a discrete droplet anchoring on the layer of Liquid A (Fig. 4a, left part).85 This condition refers to a stable liquid-liquid contact interface, and is known as slippery liquid-infused surface (SLIS),20,85-87 in which liquids A and B are respectively termed as infused lubricant and repelling liquid. Wong et al. proposed two criteria that describe such a stable wetting state of liquid layer infused solid surface:20\nA A B B A B\nA A B B B A\nL V L L V L L L\nL V L L V L L V L V\n( cos cos ) 0\n( cos cos ) 0\nr\nr\n    \n     \n\u2212 \u2212  \u2212 + \u2212  (13)\nwhere AL  and BL  are the CAs of Liquid A and Liquid B on the flat solid surface. Notably, when\nB A B AL V L L L V\n( ) 0  \u2212 +  (14)\nLiquid A spontaneously spreads over and encapsulates the droplet of Liquid B, resulting in coating of the droplet with a thin layer of Liquid A, termed as cloaking (Fig. 4a. right part).85-87 The formed droplets (both uncloaked and cloaked ones) are usually surrounded by a annular wetting ridge (Fig. 4a, b), at which four CAs, the apparent CA of the droplet (\u03b8app), and CAs between the three phases of Liquid A,\nLiquid B and vapor (i.e., AL V  , BL V  , and A BL L  ), can be found (Fig. 4b). \u03b8app can be described via the\nmodified Young\u2019 equation (eqn (15)):\nA A BL V Lp Leff ap\n=   \u2212 (15)\nwhere \u03b3eff = AL V  + A BL L  or BL V\n for Liquid B with or without a cloaking layer, respectively.88 Similarly,\nCAs between the three phases can be expressed as eqn (16):\n\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b1\u03b2, Y \u03b2S \u03b1Scos   = \u2212 (16)\nwhere the subscripts \u03b1 and \u03b2 correspond to Liquid B, Liquid A and vapor phases, and S represents solid phase. If pinning effects and the related energy barriers are negligible, they can be further given by the modified Cassie-Baxter equation (eqn (17)):88\n\u03b1\u03b2,C-B \u03b1\u03b2,Ycos cos (1 )f f = + \u2212 (17)\nwhere \u03b1 represents the Liquid A phase, \u03b2 is either the Liquid B or vapor phase, and f is the fraction of the projected solid area exposed to the \u03b2 phase.\nIn comparison, when eqn (18):\nA A B BL V L L L V\n( ) 0  \u2212 +  (18)\nis satisfied, Liquid B spreads indefinitely over the covered layer of Liquid A, leading to the formation of a Liquid B film instead of discrete droplets (Fig. 4c).85 If eqn (19):\nA A A BSV SL L V L L\n1\n1 ( ) r\nr f    \n\u2212 \u2212 +  \u2212\n\u2212 (19)\nis met, Liquid B impales the Liquid A layer and constructs a new solid-Liquid B interface (Fig. 4d).\n2.1.2.2 Solid surface immersed in liquid. When a solid surface is totally immersed in Liquid A, and the wetting by another immiscible Liquid B occurs under Liquid A, its wetting behavior becomes similar to that in air, except that the vapor phase is replaced by the Liquid A phase. Therefore, Young\u2019s equation could be expressed as:19,89\nA B B AL L BA, Y L V B, Y L V A, Y\ncos cos cos     = \u2212 (20)\nwhere A, Y , B, Y and BA, Y are the CAs of Liquid A on flat solid surface in vapor, Liquid B on flat\nsolid surface in vapor, and Liquid B on flat solid surface in Liquid A, respectively.

            "text": "Classical wetting models proposed by Young,9 Wenzel77 and Cassie-Baxter81 are all based on rigorous thermodynamics, and are thus established on the assumption that Gibbs free energy versus apparent CA of an ideal wetting system has only a single free energy minimum, indicating that a given solid surface has a unique CA value (Fig. 5a).90,91 However, even mirror-like, nearly atomically smooth and chemically controlled silicon wafer surface has a range of measurable CAs.92 Fig. 5b shows the Gibbs free energy of a real wetting system as a function of apparent CA, in which multiple free energy minima (i.e., thermodynamic equilibrium states) can be observed, corresponding to the most stable CA at the global minimum and some metastable CAs at the local minima of a real solid surface. Taking 2D droplet wetting on smooth but chemically heterogeneous solid surface with 2D periodic chemical patterns (Fig. 5c) as an example, the relationship between the ideal/apparent CAs and the position of the contact line for a given volume is shown in Fig. 5d. Practical thermodynamic equilibrium can only be achieved when the ideal\nCA curve intersects with the apparent CA curve (namely, the local ideal CA equal the apparent CA).93 Therefore, multiple equilibrium positions could be obtained, which correspond to the extremum points in the Gibbs free energy curve (Fig. 5b). Meanwhile, as a finite energy barrier separating every two adjacent equilibrium states exists (Fig. 5b), these CAs can be reached and measured depending on the balance between the energy barrier and the available drop energy. For example, mechanical vibration was suggested to overcome the energy barriers so as to evaluate the most-stable CA.94 The maximum and minimum apparent CA values in this range are termed as advancing and receding CAs (ACA and RCA, or, \u03b8adv and \u03b8rec), respectively, and their difference, \u2206\u03b8 = \u03b8adv \u2013 \u03b8rec, is defined as contact angle hysteresis (CAH). A measurable static CA could thereby be any value between ACA and RCA, which makes CA to be less meaningful while ACA and RCA to be more important in characterising surface wettability.95-97 CAH is one of the most effective parameters to evaluate the mobility of a liquid droplet on a solid surface, and smaller CAH usually represent better liquid mobility and liquid repellence.\nCAH is related to the pinning of the three-phase line. For Young wetting state on an ideal solid surface, the \u03b8adv = \u03b8rec = \u03b8Y and there is no CAH, while Wenzel wetting state generally shows low \u03b8rec and high \u2206\u03b8 due to particularly strong contact line pinning in this state, and Cassie-Baxter state is always characterised by low \u2206\u03b8. CAH has been extensively studied both from theoretical and experimental viewpoints, and some causes, such as surface heterogeneity, roughness, reorientation of molecules in the solid surface, transport of molecules from the liquid, interactions between molecules of solid and liquid at the three-phase line region, motion rate of the three-phase line on the solid surface, liquid sorption/retention on the surface, surface deformation, etc. were proposed early on to understand the fundamental underlying mechanism.60,92,98 Additionally, Lam et al. found that the CAH decreased with the chain length of the liquid, and when the alkane molecules were infinitely large \u03b8rec equals \u03b8adv, therefore the chain length and size of the liquid molecule could contribute to the CAH.99 Brandon et al. computationally investigated the partial wetting of 3D droplets, and showed that the CAH was droplet volume dependent.100 For a surface with very low CAH, the relation among \u03b8Y, \u03b8adv and \u03b8rec can be roughly written as:\nadv recY +\n= 2\n   (22)\nAdam et al. claimed that a \u201cfrictional force\u201d accounted for the CAH and it disappeared when the wetting system reached its equilibrium CA.101 They also proposed the following cosine relation of \u03b8Y, \u03b8adv and \u03b8rec:\nadv recY cos cos\n=arccos 2\n   +     \n(23)"

            "text": "CA is one of the most important values measured experimentally during characterisation of solid properties, and is regarded as the gold standard to characterise the wettability of a solid surface.97,104 Although static CA is always reported in the literature, it is highly recommended to measure the ACA and RCA (i.e., the CAH), which can indicate the wettability of the surface more comprehensively.95-97 Most techniques for CA and CAH measurement can be classified into two groups: direct methods mainly including sessile-drop goniometry and captive bubble method, and indirect methods such as the Wilhelmy balance method.\n2.2.1.1 Sessile-drop goniometry. Due to its simplicity and versatility, sessile-drop goniometry is probably the most widely used method to measure the static CA and CAH. Typically, in terms of static CA measurement, a liquid droplet with given volume is gently deposited on the solid surface by a dispensing system and a 2D profile of the droplet is then captured by a software-operated high-resolution camera under the assistance of a light source from behind (Fig. 6a). Software-based fitting via image analysis algorithms is then performed to estimate the CA value from the fitted drop shape, baseline and tangent line (Fig. 6b). With regard to CAH (i.e., ACA and RCA) measurement by sessile-drop goniometry,\ndigital images are captured during increasing or decreasing the droplet volume with the needle until the contact line starts to advance or recede on the surface, and the CA values obtained by the software-based fitting are ACA and RCA, respectively (Fig. 6c). More details about the guidelines of sessile-drop goniometry can be found in refs. 105 and 90. The sessile-drop method requires small amount of testing liquids, and can measure both plane and non-planar surfaces with small areas so as to provide their 2D wettability distribution though an amount of time is required.106,107 However, this method is susceptible to measurement details, such as image analysis, droplet volume, etc.\nSoftware-based image analysis of sessile-drop method causes inaccuracies due to optical distortions or blurs originating from experimental details such as magnification, lighting, contrast and camera resolution.97,108 The optical distortions are obvious at the area close to the three-phase contact line, and become conspicuous for surfaces with large CAs, especially for super liquid-repellent surfaces. Diffuse droplet edge and pixelation make it difficult to precisely determine the droplet shape and baseline even when a high-resolution digital image is taken, leading to systematic errors in CA measurement. For example, as illustrated in Fig. 7a, though a digital image with resolution of 1984 \u00d7 1264 pixels is used, error in CA measurement appears due to the baseline displacement providing that the droplet shape is fitted: setting baseline too high decreases CA, while setting it too low increases CA, which is a subjective process. Both simulated and experimental data showed that one-pixel displacement of the baseline would result in errors in CA value from ~ 1\u00b0 to > 10\u00b0, and the error dramatically increased for a super liquid-repellent surface with CA > 150\u00b0 (Fig. 7b).97,108 The systematic errors in CA measurement will inevitably be propagated to CAH, and even make the uncertainty of CAH worse. The error can be slightly reduced by improving measurement details, such as using high resolution cameras and enhancing droplet reflection, but cannot be eliminated entirely.\nDroplet volume (i.e., size) is another key yet under-debated factor that needs to be considered in the\nsessile-drop method. Shahraz et al. reported that water CA measured on a periodically grooved hydrophobic surface increased when the droplet volume increased from 0.4 nL to 4.5 \u03bcL.109 By contrast, Cansoy studied the effect of water droplet size on CA measurement of superhydrophobic surfaces with varying square pillar sizes and solid area fraction.110 The results demonstrated that the variation in droplet volume (0.5 \u03bcL to 19 \u03bcL) had no significant influence on the experimentally measured CA and the deviations between the predicted CAs by the Cassie-Baxter equation and the experimental values. Bell et al. showed that gravity enabled the droplet with small size to flatten and spread across the surface, and even to penetrate surface asperities more favorably, which would tend to lower the measured CA value, while CA became independent of gravity when the size of the droplet was much larger than that of the surface features.111 A recent work by Ren et al. showed that the volume (5.0 \u03bcL to 20 \u03bcL) of four resting liquids (water, glycerol, ethylene glycol and hexadecane) had no significant effect on the measured CA values of both natural Lotus leaf and artificial superhydrophobic coating. It was also demonstrated theoretically that only a small change in the three-phase line length was needed to re-balance the forces exerted to the droplet when its volume changed, so the contact ratio of solid-liquid and gas-liquid changed insignificantly, resulting in negligible change in CA.112 Therefore, to reliably characterise surface wettability via CA and CAH measurements by sessile-drop goniometry, larger droplet should be preferably employed, and the volume of a few microliters is generally recommended.\nMost work conventionally considered the effect of gravity on CA measurement by the sessile drop technique to be negligible because the radius of the adopted droplets was generally smaller than the capillary length.90 However, Extrand et al. clarified that gravity-induced sagging or distortion of sessile droplet always led to the underprediction of the CA via conventional circular-segment approximation method, especially for those droplets with lower surface tension or larger density depositing on super-liquid-repellent surfaces, the underestimation could reach up to tens of degrees.113 To address this concern, strategies like employing small sessile droplets (on the order of hundreds of picolitres),113 estimating CA by using the maximum droplet width and height,114 and Cassie-levitating droplet model115 have been proposed to improve the accuracy of CA measurement. Moreover, Kim et al. demonstrated that the ACA and RCA were not affected by gravity, while the overall shape of the droplet and the position of the pinning point were affected by gravity, and that the gravitational effect played a key role in the movement of the droplet tip during continuously increasing or decreasing the volume of the droplet.116\nAdditionally, other measurement details such as the resting time of deposited droplet on surface,117,118 temperature,119 and dispense rate as well as the distance between the dispense needle and the surface should also be considered in CA and CAH measurement by the sessile-drop goniometry.120\nAnother commonly-used yet under-debated optical method to measure CAH is tilting-plate method, in which the tilting angle of the surface with a droplet is gradually increased until the droplet starts moving, and after fitting the corresponding digital image, the CAs measured from the leading and trailing edges of the distorted droplet are regarded as ACA and RCA, respectively (Fig. 6d). However, the CAs on two edges of a droplet on a tilted plate are not independent of each other. Krasovitski et al. found that the CAs at the leading and trailing edges did not always simultaneously equal the ACA and RCA, respectively.121 They clarified that on a hydrophobic surface, the CA at the trailing edge tended to be approximately equal to the RCA, while the CA at the leading edge might be much lower than the ACA; but for a hydrophilic surface, the CA at the trailing edge was lower than the RCA, whereas the CA at the leading edge was roughly equal to the ACA. Pierce et al. demonstrated that CAH measured by tilting-plate method was liquid volume-dependent, which is contrary to the fact that the CAH is a surface property that does not depend on droplet size.122 Therefore, the obtained results from the tilting-plate method are not necessarily representing reliable CAH, and this method is sometimes not recommended.\n2.2.1.2 Captive bubble method. Captive bubble method is another optical technique widely used for CA and CAH measurements. As shown in Fig. 8a, the solid sample is pre-immersed horizontally in the liquid with the surface to be measured downward, and a bubble with a certain volume is gently released by a needle, which is subsequently captured by the lower surface. Then the 2D profile of the bubble is recorded and analyzed via software-based fitting of the bubble shape, baseline, and tangent line to the liquid-gas interface. The fitting procedure is similar to the procedure of sessile-drop method described in 2.2.1.1, while the difference is that the CA, \u03b8, of the testing liquid on the surface is complementary to the angle between the baseline and tangent line (\u03b8b), that is: 93\nb180 = \u2212 (24)\nSimilarly, the ACA and RCA of the bubble on the surface (\u03b8b,adv and \u03b8b,rec) can be obtained by increasing or decreasing the volume of the bubble (Fig. 8b), thereby achieving the \u03b8adv and \u03b8rec of the testing liquid on the surface as follows:\nadv s,adv b,rec\nrec s,rec b,adv\n180 180 =      =  \u2212 =  \u2212= (25)\nwhere \u03b8s,adv and \u03b8s,rec respectively represent the ACA and RCA from sessile-drop goniometry. Eqn (25) describes the complementary relationship of ACA and RCA measured by sessile-drop and captive-bubble methods, which indicates that captive bubble method can be readily used for the ACA and RCA calculations,93,123 especially for cases where the sessile-drop method cannot be adopted. However, the recent works demonstrated that for a rough hydrophilic surface, the \u03b8s,adv and \u03b8b,rec tended to deviate from the complementary rule, which could be attributed to the contrasting wetting states: the liquid droplet totally wets the rough surface in sessile-drop method (i.e., Wenzel state), while the bubble cannot totally dry the surface in captive bubble method since the trapped liquid in rough structures cannot be completely replaced by the captive bubble (termed as \u201cinverted Cassie-Baxter state\u201d).124,125\nPractical use of the captive bubble method is severely limited by its complex operation, however, this method is suitable for the wettability characterisation of solid surfaces that are always applied in liquid environments, such as biomaterials that are used in human body or other living bodies.126-128 Biomaterials are generally hydrophilic and are immersed in tissue fluids during long-time utilization so as to form long-lasting hydrated surfaces. When the captive bubble method is used to measure the CA and CAH of the biomaterials, pre-immersion in liquids that are similar to the tissue fluids simulates a real service condition and imparts the surface with hydratability, thereby enabling accurate in vivo wettability evaluation via in vitro CA and CAH measurements.\nXue et al. proposed a modified captive bubble method, in which the bubble volume was adjusted by the pressure of the testing chamber instead of using a needle.129 This modification eliminated the distortion of the bubble induced by needle, and thus provided more accurate and repeatable ACA and RCA values. They also confirmed that the captive bubble method was only available for surfaces with ACA and RCA values below 130\u00b0.\n2.2.1.3 Wilhelmy balance method. The Wilhelmy balance method130 proposed in 1863 is another ancient technique used for measuring CA and CAH of a solid surface.131 Generally, as shown in Fig. 9a, a thin plate sample is dipped vertically into the testing liquid, the total forces acting on the plate include the\ngravity (Gp), the capillary force due to surface tension of the liquid (Fc), the buoyancy force (Fb), and the plate holding force measured by the microbalance force sensor (Fm). Since the thickness of the plate is much smaller than the other two dimensions, the form drag (i.e., pressure drag) is negligible. The CA of the plate surface cannot be directedly measured but can be determined based on the following force balance equation:\nm b p c cosF F G F + = + (26)\nGp, Fc and Fb can be described as:\np c cl b h\nG mg F P F gV   = = =\n(27)\nwhere m is the mass of the plate, Pcl is the length of contact line between the plate and liquid, which is roughly equal to the perimeter of the plate, \u03b3 and \u03c1 are respectively the surface tension and density of the testing liquid, Vh denotes the volume of the plate immersed in the liquid with immersion depth of h, g is the gravitational acceleration. Notably, the direction of Fc depends on the wettability of the plate\u2019s surfaces. For example, as depicted in Fig. 9a, when the surface is hydrophobic, the cosine component of Fc is upward (i.e., opposite to Gp). Combination of eqns (26) and (27) yields the CA value measured by the Wilhelmy balance method as:\nm h\ncl\narccos F gV mg\nP\n \n\n+ \u2212 = (28)\nSimilarly, the ACA and the RCA can be respectively obtained via Fm measurements during the advancing and receding of the plate (Fig. 9b), which is also termed as the dynamic Wilhelmy balance method. Fig. 9c illustrates a typical curve of Fm vs immersion depth h for the dynamic Wilhelmy balance method.\nThe Wilhelmy plate method is regarded as a fully automatic and thus \u201coperator-error-free\u201d technique for CA characterisation, and had been expected to obtain more accurate and highly reproducible CA values than other experimental methods, but this advantage is gradually diminishing due to rapid development of sessile-drop goniometry. A large surface area is analyzed in the Wilhelmy balance method, thereby making the influence of small surface imperfections/contaminations on the measured CA to be negligible. Additionally, 1D resolution of surface wettability along the advancing/receding direction can be achieved by the Wilhelmy technique. This method is much preferred for CA measurement of plain plate,132,133 fabric134 and fiber135 with rectangular or cylindrical shapes (i.e., a constant perimeter) and same chemistries in both sides. For samples with different wettability on the two sides, back-to-back bonding is suggested to expose two same surfaces for measurement. Recently, it was shown that the Wilhelmy balance technique could also be used for the CA measurement of irregular shaped samples with a variable perimeter.136,137 For example, Park et al. proposed to determine the perimeter of the sample as a function of the immersion depth by profile plot obtained from the optical image, and then measured the ACA and RCA via the Wilhelmy balance method, which was verified with triangular and irregular PTFE sheets in water.136 However, the precise estimation of Pcl in eqns (27) and (28) is always difficult, especially for those porous or textured surfaces, the contact line is significantly different from the geometric perimeter, which can be a large source of error.\nSample thickness is traditionally negligible in this method, and the viscous frictions acting on the bottom and sides due to sample movement are ignored in eqn (26). However, recent researches showed that taking viscous frictions into consideration could well guarantee the measurement accuracy of CAH via the Wilhelmy balance method, especially when thick sample, highly viscous liquid and high moving speed of the sample were used.138,139 Furthermore, Zhang et al. found that the viscous drag forces acting on the submerged plate surface during a dynamic Wilhelmy plate experiment could be of the same order of magnitude as surface tension forces, which were always highly underestimated due to the ignorance of the interface curvature, the tip of the plate, or the flow formed between the plate and liquid container.140 They further proposed a new viscous drag force model that incorporated the effects of the moving contact line, the leading edge of a flat plate and a Couette-Poiseuille flow to measure CA by the Wilhelmy plate method, and the results of their demonstrative example showed that CA values of glycerin advancing on glass plate increased by 20\u00b0 while the capillary number varied from 10\u22123 to 10\u22121.\nTable 1 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the above-discussed CA and CAH measurement methods. It has to be noted that each measurement method has its own strengths and shortcomings, and the most suitable method should be selected based on the specific features of the substrate (e.g., size, shape, composition, and estimated CA range), the application condition, as well as the measurement purposes. 2.2.2 Sliding/rolling-off angle Sliding/rolling-off angle (SA/RA) is another common characteristic for the wettability of solid surfaces, especially for liquid-repellent surfaces, since it can easily reflect the mobility of the liquid droplets\ndeposited on the surfaces. Generally, the SA/RA can be measured by the same instruments used in CA measurement via sessile-drop goniometry method with the assistance of a tilting plate. During the measurement process, the solid sample is firstly fixed on the plate horizontally, and then the plate is tilted slowly until the droplet starts to slide or roll, by which time the tilt angle of the plate can be regarded as the SA/RA (i.e., the \u03b1tilt shown in Fig. 6d). Thus, the SA/RA denotes the tilting angle at which the gravitational force component of the droplet along the inclined surface (i.e., mgsin \u03b1tilt, where m is the mass of the droplet, g is the acceleration of gravity) overcomes the lateral moving resistance that mainly originates from the adhesion force between the solid and liquid, as well as rough structures induced obstruction. Therefore, small SA/RA always indicates weak solid-liquid adhesion and high liquid droplet mobility on the surface, making SA/RA indispensable in evaluating the liquid repellence of a solid surface.\nAlthough the measurement of SA/RA is easy to be realized, it\u2019s sensitive to operational details, such as droplet volume, dropping speed of the droplet, resting time of the droplet on the surface, tilting speed of the plate, etc. Droplet volume is widely considered in literatures, and it was demonstrated that increasing the droplet volume could generally lower the SA/RA.141 However, other measurement details are always reported intangibly, and the specific influence have been rarely focused on, making it difficult and even unreliable for the quantitative comparison among different reports."

            "text": "A liquid droplet is usually in molecular contact with the underneath solid surface, the intermolecular forces, commonly referred as adhesive forces, will inevitably impede the motion of the droplet. The\nadhesive forces are closely related to the wettability of the surface, so their measurement can also be used to characterise the wettability of solid surfaces, especially those with liquid repellence.102\n2.2.3.1 Lateral adhesive force. When a liquid droplet is moved along a solid surface, the lateral adhesive force (Flat) acts as the friction force. Conventionally, the tilting method is used to measure the ACA and RCA of the moving droplet, and then Flat can be roughly calculated by eqn (29): 142\nlat LV rec adv(cos cos )F R  = \u2212 (29)\nwhere R is the base radius of the droplet. Thus, the tilting method is actually dependent on the accurate measurement of CAH and determination of the baseline. Therefore, when the ACA and RCA of the surface approach each other, for example, an ultra-slippery PDMS-chains grafted surface with CAH lower than 2\u00b0,143 this method becomes unapplicable owing to the limited accuracy of CAH measurement and baseline determination (see Section 2.1.1).144 Additionally, it is difficult to study the time-dependence and velocity-dependence of Flat by the traditional tilting method.\nRecently, force measurement by elastic cantilevers have been employed to measure Flat as an important emerging technique.102,145,146 Generally, a liquid droplet deposited on the surface is attached through capillary force to a force-calibrated elastic cantilever (effective spring constant k). When the substrate is moved and relative motion between the droplet and the surface appears, Flat works and results in a deflection of the cantilever (\u0394x). Then Flat can be directly calculated by eqn (30):\nlatF k x=  (30)\nThe deflection can be easily detected by a high-resolution camera from the side. For example, Backholm et al. designed a micropipette cantilever-based setup to measure the lateral friction of water droplet moving on a superhydrophobic surface (Fig. 10a).144 During the measurement, as shown in Fig. 10b, the pre-deposited water droplet with radius of ~ 620 \u03bcm was firstly attached to the micropipette cantilever, and was then pulled along the substrate with a constant speed of v ~ 0.1 mm s\u22121 until the elastic force from the deflected micropipette matched the lateral friction force of the substrate. At this moment, the deflection (\u0394x) remained nearly constant while the droplet started to slide along the surface. In the recorded force-time curve (Fig. 10c), the average equilibrium position of the micropipette was first recorded for ~ 5 s after which the surface started moving, and the difference between the average zero and kinetic plateau force represented the kinetic friction (Flat ~ 10 \u00b1 4 nN). It was also demonstrated that this method achieved a force resolution of as low as ~ 4 nN, which was up to three orders of magnitude more precise than using eqn (29). The same group further used this method to study the pinning behavior of water droplets on various superhydrophobic surfaces with high spatial resolution.147 Similarly, the lateral adhesive force measurement of an oil droplet on underwater superoleophobic surface,148 and that of droplets on SLISs,149 have also been reported.\nGao et al. employed a position-sensitive detector (PSD) to record the laser beam incident on the capillary (Fig. 10d), which could be then used to calculate \u0394x with high resolution and accuracy.150 The authors thereby measured the friction that impeded the lateral motion of liquid droplets on various solid\nsurfaces. As a representative example, Fig. 10e shows the Flat (measured and calculated by both eqns (30) and (29)) during the motion of an ionic liquid (1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) on fluorinated silicon wafer. Moving the wafer laterally increased the force until a threshold force of ~ 50 \u03bcN was reached (the static regime), upon which the droplet started to slide. Then the force gradually decreased and stabilized at ~ 33 \u03bcN (the kinetic regime). It could be seen that the threshold static force was higher than the force required for continuous motion of the droplet, which is analogous to well-known solid-solid friction. Once the threshold adhesion force was overcome, the liquid-solid interaction changed from a static regime to a steady kinetic regime, and the Flat in the two regimes were substantially different due to their dissimilar CAs and contact widths. Their results also showed that Flat depended on the interplay between surface tension and CAH, and for a specific liquid droplet, lower Flat could sometimes indicate better liquid repellence for the solid surface. Moreover, it was demonstrated that Flat could be used to characterise the time-resolved pinning-depinning dynamics of the droplet by moving it across the surface.151\n2.2.3.2 Normal adhesive force. Compared to lateral adhesive force (friction force, to be more precise) which is surface structures-dependent due to the liquid meniscus trapped within the rough structures, normal adhesive force (Fnor) reflects the liquid-solid adhesion more directly. Therefore, Fnor has been\nwidely employed to characterise the wettability of liquid-repellent surfaces.152-154 Daniel et al. measured the Fnor between liquid and superhydrophobic surfaces by attaching a micrometric-sized 40-wt% glycerin-water droplet to an atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever (Fig. 11a).151 The vertical force acting on the droplet was linearly proportional to the flexular deflection (\u0394z) of the AFM cantilever (i.e., be similar to eqn (30)), and \u0394z was detected by focusing a laser beam onto the cantilever and reflected into a 4-quadrant sensor. Fig. 11b is the measured force spectroscopy for a 30-\u03bcm-diameter droplet with volume of 20 \u00b1 2 pL approaching and retracting from one of the superhydrophobic scales of a butterfly wing at v = 10 \u03bcm s\u22121. It could be seen that when the droplet was approaching towards the solid surface, there was a sudden attractive snap-in force (132 nN) upon contact (z = 0 \u03bcm); after slight continuous pressing and then retracting, a maximum adhesion force, Fnor = 720 nN, was obtained when the droplet was completely detached from the surface. Liimatainen et al. measured the Fnor of single hydrophobic micro pillar by a vertically mounted force sensor with a water droplet probe (Fig. 11c), and found that the Fnor < 4500 nN for a 5 \u03bcm radius pillar (Fig. 11d), and the force increased with the droplet radius. 155 They also measured the Fnor for various (super)hydrophobic surfaces, and showed that the force was related to both CA and CAH of the surface.\nMore importantly, Fnor measurement can be a desired technique to map the wetting properties of solid surfaces with high spatial and force resolution, even for those non-flat surfaces, which is almost impossible by traditional CA method.147,151,155 For example, Fig. 11e illustrates the Fnor map of a eyespot area on a butterfly wing, clearly showing low adhesive force (< 3.4 \u03bcN) and microscale wettability inhomogeneity of the surface.155 Recently, Hokkanen et al. used the same technique to map the Fnor of various commercial superhydrophobic coatings, and found that even the best coatings showed regional wettability heterogeneity in sub-mm scale.147"

            "text": "According to the above discussion, the wettability of macroscopically flat surface with clearly visible contact line between testing liquid and substrate can be well characterised by CA and SA/RA measurements. However, these techniques are sometimes not applicable to soft porous materials (e.g., textile and cotton wool) since their contact lines cannot be defined and the macroscopically rough structures make SA/RA measurements unreliable.156,157 Aiming at this problem, Zimmermann et al. proposed to evaluate the water repellence of superhydrophobic textiles qualitatively by water shedding angle (WSA).156 Briefly, a water droplet was released onto the inclined superhydrophobic surface from a defined height, and the minimum tilting angle at which the droplet completely rolled off from the surface was defined as the WSA. The authors compared the qualitative differences in water repellence of superhydrophobic silicone nanofilament coated textiles, and found that the textile parameters such as fiber dimension, yarn, and weave influenced the WSA. It is obvious that the WSA can only reflect the short-term wetting resistance of a liquid-repellent surface. If a water droplet deposited on a soft porous material maintained a high CA for a while before being completely wicked into the substrate, the WSA was inadequate to judge the overall wetting behavior of the substrate, and additional wettability characterisation methods would be required.\nBouncing is a common dynamic behavior when liquid droplet impinges liquid-repellent surfaces, it indicates a redefined air gap between the liquid droplet and the solid surface after impacting. Crick et al. proposed to evaluate the hydrophobicity based on the ability of water to bounce on a solid surface.158 They tested a wide range of surfaces with static water CAs between 0\u2013175\u00b0, and found that the surfaces with rounded microstructure showed water bouncing when the CAs were larger than 151\u00b0, while surfaces promoting water pinning disabled water to bounce unless the CAs exceed 156\u00b0. Moreover, the number of water bouncing increased linearly with the water CA of superhydrophobic surfaces with similar microstructures. This characterisation method for liquid repellence ruled out personal errors in classic CA measurement, enabling it to be a more accessible technique providing results that could be directly compared among different works. Lu et al. further demonstrated that liquid droplet bouncing occurred on soft porous materials, and thereby liquid bouncing could be used to define a soft surface as being super liquid-repellent.157\nIn addition, solid-liquid/liquid-liquid interface imaging by environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM),159,160 AFM,161 confocal microscopy,47,162,163 etc. has also been widely used to characterise the\nwettability of solid surfaces. Taking confocal microscopy as an example, liquids (and solids) are generally fluorescently dyed, which enabled fluorescence emission under photoexcitation. Then the emission signals from different dyes and the reflected light from the interfaces are recorded, for example, by laser scanning confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 12a, when a water droplet was deposited on a superhydrophobic surface, a visible air layer (i.e., Cassie-Baxter wetting state) could be seen with the assistance of solid-liquid interface imaging.47 The confocal microscopy image of SLIS could visualize the lubricant layer underneath the droplet and the wetting ridge (Fig. 12b), as well as the cloaking (wrapping) layer,162 which favors the understanding of the special wetting properties of SLIS. Li et al. used confocal fluorescence and reflection interference contrast microscopy to demonstrate the role of hierarchical micro- and nano- structures on underwater superoleophobicity (Fig. 12c).163 Imaging of the solid-liquid interfaces can be an alternative technique to study the dynamic behaviors of the moving droplet (e.g., measurement of ACA and RCA, pinning and depinning, Fig. 12d),164 and wetting state transition (Fig. 12e).165 Moreover, these confocal microscopy images could be used to determine the droplet shape and baseline more accurately, thus facilitating the static CA measurement, as shown in Fig. 12b and c."

            "text": "Due to their extremely low CAH, low adhesion, and high mobility towards water droplets (i.e., the Cassie-Baxter wetting state), superhydrophobic surfaces with water CAs larger than 150\u00b0 and RAs smaller than 10\u00b0 are the most fascinating water-repellent surfaces. The research of superhydrophobic surfaces can be dated back to 1944 when duck feather was reported to be water-repellent, and the importance of rough structure for water repellence was first emphasized.81 Barthlott et al. studied the self-cleaning property of the Lotus leaf (Fig. 13a), and found that the epidermal microscale papillae (Fig. 13b) and epicuticular wax crystalloids were the key to its water repellence.15 Jiang\u2019s group further reported that the micro- and nano-scale two-tier structures (i.e., microscale papillae covered with branch-like nanostructures, Fig. 13c) enabled the upper surface of a Lotus leaf to possess high CA (~ 161.0 \u00b1 2.7\u00b0) and low SA (~ 2\u00b0).16 Since then, various superhydrophobic surfaces in nature, such as rice leaf,16 legs of water strider,166 butterfly wings,167 mosquito compound eyes,168 taro leaf,169 etc. have been discovered, and shown that the air cushion underneath the water droplet and the low solid-liquid fractional area (i.e., the Cassie-Baxter wetting state) are critical for superhydrophobic surfaces with large CA and small CAH, which further boost the modern development of artificial super water-repellent surfaces.170-172 Comparatively, nature also provides some superhydrophobic but not super water-repellent surfaces, referred to as high-adhesive superhydrophobic surfaces, such as rose petal,173 Salvinia leaf,174 gecko feet,175 peanut leaf,176 etc. The water CAs of rose petal and peanut leaf are indeed larger than 150\u00b0, but water droplets adhere to the surfaces and cannot roll off even when the petal or leaf are turned upside down due to the formed Cassie impregnating wetting state on the petal surface173 and quasi-continuous three-phase contact line at the microscale on the peanut leaf surface.176 The high water adhesive forces of Salvinia leaf and gecko feet, respectively, originate from the hydrophilic patches distributed on superhydrophobic surfaces174 and the contact between water and high-density nanopillars.175 Therefore, these high-adhesive superhydrophobic surfaces are not discussed in this review.\nThe past twenty years have witnessed an all-round development of superhydrophobic surfaces. Based on the strategy of \u201cmicro- and/or nanoscale rough structures + low surface energy chemistry\u201d, various elegant methods and their combinations have been proposed to prepare superhydrophobic surfaces, such as chemical etching/deposition,177-179 self-assembly,180,181 electrochemical methods,182,183 electrospinning,184,185 hydrothermal method,186,187 plasma exposure,188,189 laser based ablation and 3D printing,190-193 templating,72,194,195 spraying,196-198 and so on.171,172 2.3.2 Superoleophobic surface Organic liquids such as oils are ubiquitous and are widely-used in our daily life and industries. Imparting solid surfaces with oil-repellence is therefore significant sometimes in order to prevent them from being\nwetted or contaminated by oils. Superoleophobic surfaces with oil CAs > 150\u00b0 and SAs < 10\u00b0 in air or underwater have drawn keen research interests recently due to their remarkable repellence towards oily liquids.\n2.3.2.1 Superoleophobic surface in air. Oily liquids generally have much lower surface tensions than that of water,200,201 making it energetically favorable for oils to wet most of the super water-repellent surfaces. Therefore, surfaces with superoleophobicity could be more desired in terms of liquid repellence in oily environments. To the best of our knowledge, the first superoleophobic surface in air was reported in 1997 by Tsujii et al. who modified an anodically oxidized aluminum surface with fluorinated monoalkylphosphates.202 They showed that a rapeseed oil droplet on the prepared surface remained spherical shape with a CA of 150\u00b0, and could roll around without attaching when the surface was slightly tilted. However, insufficient understanding of the critical factors for superoleophobicity limited the continuous development of super oil-repellent surfaces in the following 10 years. In 2007, Tuteja et al. demonstrated that re-entrant surface curvature, in conjunction with low surface energy and roughened texture, allows for the construction of surfaces that show non-wetting ability towards a number of oily liquids with low surface tension.17 They further clarified that when an oil droplet is deposited on a surface with re-entrant texture, the net force acting on the liquid-gas interface is directed upward, so the oil cannot penetrate the rough structures, thereby stabilizing the air pockets beneath the oil droplets and forming a solid-liquid-gas composite interface in the Cassie-Baxter state.203 These works shed light on the key to designing superoleophobic surfaces and thus initiated the rapid development of super oil-repellent surfaces.12,64,204 Subsequently, the skin of springtails was demonstrated to be super oil-repellent due to its overhanging microstructures (Fig. 14a), which benefit their living in habitats with surface-active substances contaminated water and potentially harmful microorganisms.18\nRe-entrant structure for superoleophobic surfaces can be realized with well-defined overhang geometries, like micro inverted trapezoid,207,208 micro/nano hoodoo,17,209,210 and mushroom-like micropillars,211-216 or with randomly aggregated micro-/nanostructures with inward curvature.217-222 Li et al. designed surface textures with re-entrant curvature on both micro- and nanoscales, and found that\ncompared with the single micro and single nano re-entrant superoleophobic surfaces, the micro/nano re-entrant-coordinated superoleophobic surface showed higher CA, lower CAH and smaller adhesion towards various liquids with surface tensions ranging from 26.5\u201372 mN m\u22121.223 Therefore, micro re-entrant structures can enhance the oil-repellence of superoleophobic surfaces. Liu et al. reported that a doubly re-entrant microstructure (Fig. 14b) can render any solid surfaces super repellent towards all available liquids (including perfluorohexane) even without low surface energy chemistry.188 These specific doubly and even triply re-entrant structures show incomparable advantages in creating the structural basis for superoleophobicity, and have been widely employed in the design of excellent super oil-repellent surfaces.191,192,224-227 However, these well-defined re-entrant microstructures are usually fabricated by reactive ion etching,188 photopolymerization based 3D printing,191,192,224-229 or recently-reported laser-induced localised heating and ablation of a bilayer matrix,216 which suffer from limited substrate selection and difficulty for scale-up production. Recently, by harnessing the configurable elastic crack engineering, Li et al. proposed a facile and high-efficient method to construct arbitrary hierarchical structures (including well-defined, regular array structures) with broad material compatibility by harnessing the configurable elastic crack engineering, and as an example, they fabricated a superoleophobic polypropylene surface with an array of doubly re-entrant structures (Fig. 14c), which exhibited excellent repellence to various liquids including hexane with surface tension of ~ 18.6 mN m\u22121 (Fig. 14d).63 Yet despite this, randomly structured super oil-repellent surfaces by spraying,220 templating,217 etc. could possess higher potential for scale-up production.\nDue to the higher surface tension of water, most surfaces that are superoleophobic in air are also superhydrophobic, which has led them to be termed as superamphiphobic,17,204,217 omniphobic49,188,209 or superomniphobic188,230,231 surfaces. However, some studies show that special design of the surface chemistry (e.g., using fluorosurfactant that contains a low surface tension fluorinated tail and a high surface tension head group) enables the as-prepared surfaces to be both superoleophobic and superhydrophilic in air.205,206,232-234 Water molecules induced surface reconfiguration is widely adopted to explain this counterintuitive phenomenon since complete water spreading (i.e., water CA decreased to ~ 0\u00b0) always takes some time (typically tens of seconds to several minutes or even longer).232,233 Brown et al. fabricated a superoleophobic-superhydrophilic surface by a layer-by-layer technique and deposition of fluorosurfactant (Capstone FS-50, DuPont), which showed super oil-repellence and rapid water wetting (within 2 s).234 They attributed this to the molecule size difference between oil and water: larger oil molecules are blocked by the top fluorinated layer while smaller water molecules can penetrate through the top layer and contacting with the underlying hydrophilic region.234,235 Recently, Pan\u2019s group fabricated various superoleophobic-superhydrophilic surfaces with rapid response for both oil repellence and water spreading, and proposed a theory based on the dispersive and non-dispersive component of surface free energy.205,206 For example, the sprayed coating from the mixture of TiO2 nanoparticles and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, CF3(CF2)6COOH) showed superamphobicity (Fig. 14e) because the non-dispersive and dispersive components of its surface free energy are both low. However, after\nreplacing the hydrogen atom of PFOA with sodium (Na) atom, the non-dispersive component became higher while the dispersive component remained low since the fluorocarbon chains were unchanged. Therefore, the sprayed coating consisting of TiO2 nanoparticles and sodium perfluorooctanoate (CF3(CF2)6COONa) showed superoleophobicity and superhydrophilicity (Fig. 14f and g) as the fluorocarbon chains repels the nonpolar oil, whereas the hydrophilic Na+ attracts the polar water. Similarly, Sun et al. fabricated superoleophobic-superhydrophilic surfaces by using Capstone FS-50 modified SiO2 nanoparticles, which could be rapidly wetted by highly polar liquids (e.g., water) while completely repel nonpolar oily liquids (e.g., n-hexadecane).236\n2.3.2.2 Superoleophobic surface underwater. In 2009, Liu et al. reported that fish scales (Fig. 15a) with superhydrophilicity in air shows superoleophobicity underwater.19 Fish scales are composed of calcium phosphate, protein, and a thin layer of mucus; the surface morphology is characterised by oriented rough micropapillae with length of 100\u2013300 \u03bcm and width of 30\u201340 \u03bcm (Fig. 15b), enabling the scales to be superhydrophilic and superoleophilic in air (Fig. 15c). When an oil droplet comes into contact with the fish scales that were immersed in water, the trapped water in the micro/nano structures assists the formation of an oil-water-solid composite interface that coincides with the Cassie-Baxter wetting model, thereby showing underwater superoleophobicity with CA of 156.4 \u00b1 3.0\u00b0 for 1,2-dichloroethane droplet (Fig. 15d). In the following years, some other natural creatures with underwater superoleophobic surfaces have also been discovered, such as the lower side of Lotus leaf,237 clam\u2019s shell,238 filefish skin,239 seaweed,240 aloe vera mucilage,241 pomfret skin,242 etc.\nThe construction of underwater superoleophobic surface is based on introducing the repulsive water phase into the roughly structured hydrophilic surface, which opens up a new research area for super oil-repellent surfaces.19 It has been proven that the combination of hydrophilicity in air and roughness generally endows surfaces with superoleophobicity underwater.19,64,237-240 Therefore, the strategy to fabricate underwater superoleophobic surface focuses on creating superhydrophilic surface in air, and many methods have been employed to construct such underwater super oil-repellent surfaces, such as dip-/spray-coating,243,244 chemical treatment,245,246 electrochemical method,247,248 plasma exposure,249-251 electrospinning,184,252 thermal treatment,253,254 lithography,255 laser texturing,256 etc."

            "text": "Although superhydrophobic and superoleophobic surfaces always possess excellent liquid repellence, most of them suffer from poor mechanical durability, weak air cushion stability in terms of high pressure or liquid intrusion.11 Inspired by carnivorous plants such as Nepenthes pitcher plant (Fig. 16a), which captures prey by a slippery, water-infused surface at the rim of the pitcher,257 Wong et al. reported slippery liquid-infused surfaces (SLISs) by infiltrating epoxy-resin-based nanofabricated post array or Teflon-based porous nanofiber network with perfluorinated liquids (such as 3M Fluorinert FC-70, DuPont Krytox 100 and 103) (Fig. 16b).20 The infused liquid (i.e., lubricant) is locked in place by the micro/nano structures and forms a physically smooth and chemically homogeneous lubricating film on the solid surface. When a droplet of another immiscible liquid contacts the SLIS, a liquid-liquid interface between the infused liquid and droplet is created, and an infused liquid \u201ccushion\u201d retains beneath the testing liquid, preventing the solid surface from being wetted by the testing liquid (Fig. 16c). Depending on the surface tension of the infused liquid, SLIS is characterised by exceptional liquid repellence (negligible CAHs and low SAs for low surface tension liquids and their complex mixtures), instantaneous and repeatable self-healing after mechanical damage, and extreme pressure stability, all of which are advantages over traditional superhydrophobic and superoleophobic surfaces,11 thereby making SLIS to become another fascinating candidate of liquid-repellent surfaces in the past decade. Besides SLIS, some other terms are also adopted to describe slippery liquid-repellent surface in the literature, such as slippery liquid-infused porous surface,11,20 slippery pre-suffused surface,258 liquid-infused surface,14,259 lubricant-infused surface,11,85,87 and lubricant-impregnated surface,86,260 and we use the \u201cSLIS\u201d to represent this kind of slippery liquid-repellent surface throughout this review.\nTo prepare SLIS successfully, three main design criteria must be met:20 (i) the infused liquid must wick into, wet and stably adhere within the substrate, (ii) the solid surface must be preferentially wetted by the infused liquid rather than by the testing liquid that is to be repelled, namely, the surface tensions of the infused liquid and testing liquid, and the interfacial tension at the liquid-liquid interface must satisfy eqns (12)\u2013(14), and (iii) the infused liquid and the testing liquid must be immiscible. Hydrophobic and porous/textured substrates are generally combined to construct SLISs since micro/nano structures and low solid surface energy favor the immobilization and stabilization of the infused liquids via capillary forces and intermolecular forces.20,261,262 However, recent works have demonstrated that hydrophilic smooth\nsurfaces can also be imparted with slippery liquid repellence via some ingenious strategies, such as immobilizing infused liquid via \u03c0-OH or \u03c0-COOH interactions,263,264 and covalent graft of liquid-like polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based brushes.143,265-273 For example, Wang et al. prepared slippery liquid-like omniphobic coatings on hydrophilic smooth glass slides by covalently grafting PDMS brushes through rapid acid-catalyzed polycondensation of dimethyldimethoxysilane monomers (Fig. 17a, b).143 Fang et al. fabricated a highly smooth (roughness of < 1 nm), ultrathin (thickness of ~ 2 nm) and transparent slippery \u201cliquid-like\u201d coating on silicon wafer substrate through one-step condensation under heating (100 \u00b0C for 24 h).274 The grafted PDMS chains possess high mobility through rotational and/or bending motions since only one end is covalently grafted to the surface,275 and the mobile PDMS chains can facilitate the motion of triple-phase contact lines by minimizing the Gibbs free energy barriers between metastable states, which imparts the coated surfaces with excellent liquid repellence (Fig. 17c).143 It is further demonstrated that the PDMS-grafted layer creates chemical affinity to nonpolar liquids, enabling the immobilization of silicone oil, which makes hydrophilic flat surfaces to be slippery and repellent towards various liquids and even soft viscoelastic solids.276,277 Additionally, swelling flat polymer matrixes by suitable infusing liquids are also proved to be effective in preparing SLISs, and the most common combination is PDMS swelling in silicon oil.278-281 Recently, Salbaum et al. proposed to confine ionic liquids to the underlying flat substrate by swelling of polymeric gels that were functionalized to match the chemical structure of the ionic liquids, their molecular interactions were maximized and thus yielded an enduring slippery ionic liquid-infused organogels.282\nImmiscibility of the infused liquid and testing liquid is another major requirement for preparing SLIS.20,85,87 Sett et al. investigated the miscibility of a range of testing liquids (surface tensions of 12\u221273 mN m\u22121) with widely used lubricants (viscosities of 5\u22122700 cSt) in SLIS design.87 The tested lubricants included fluorinated Krytox oils (Krytox 1506, 1525, and 16256), hydrocarbon silicone oils (with viscosities of 5, 100, 500, and 1000 cSt), carnation mineral oil, and ionic liquids (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-imide, BMIm), while water, alcohols, alkanes, ethylene glycol, toluene, and perfluorohexane (Fluorinert FC-72) were used as testing liquids. Results indicated that no single lubricant was suitable for all of the testing liquids. As depicted in Fig. 18, Krytox oils should be the preferred lubricants for most of the studied testing liquids except perfluorohexane, carnation oil might be suitable for polar organic compounds (such as ethylene glycol, ethanol, and perfluorohexane), ionic liquid BMIm was the desired lubricant for repelling alkanes, and silicone oils should be infused to build SLIS that repelled perfluorohexane."

Meanwhile, some related terminologies, such as thermodynamic/mechanical/chemical stability/robustness/durability,43,44,286-291 wear/abrasion-resistance,286,292-295 chemical/corrosion resistance,72,291,296 etc., have been employed to describe the ability of liquid-repellent surfaces to survive in various conditions.

Accordingly, to unify the terminology, we use \u201cthermodynamic durability\u201d, \u201cmechanical durability\u201d and \u201cchemical durability\u201d to describe the long-term stability of liquid-repellent surfaces under corresponding external conditions throughout this review.

            "text": "The liquid repellence of superhydrophobic and superoleophobic (both in air and underwater) surfaces relies\non the air or water cushion trapped/locked in the rough structures (i.e., the Cassie-Baxter wetting state), and that of SLIS originates from the infused liquid layer. The cushion layer may be thermodynamically damaged under some conditions, such as diffusion, evaporation, drainage, etc. Therefore, the thermodynamic durability of these liquid-repellent surfaces refers to the persistence or recovery of the air or liquid cushions during contact with testing liquids or exposure to other medium.\nIt is well established that the air cushion beneath testing liquid is indispensable to build the Cassie-Baxter wetting state of superhydrophobic and superoleophobic (in air) surfaces with super liquid repellence. However, the trapped air cushion could be destroyed under some conditions that the surfaces typically undergo during use, which finally leads to a so-called Cassie-Baxter to Wenzel transition (also termed as impalement), and thereby resulting in the pinning of liquid droplet and loss of super liquid repellence.13,283,285,299,300 The wetting transition occurs when the wetting pressure exceeds the capillary pressure of the meniscus,300 and it has been observed in many scenarios. For example, pressing the water droplet placed on a superhydrophobic surface can trigger its wetting state transition from Cassie-Baxter to Wenzel, leaving the droplet to stick on the surface (Fig. 19a).300,301 Liquid droplet/jet impacting on super liquid-repellent surface leads to either complete rebound of the droplet with the air cushion retained (i.e., Cassie-Baxter state) or partial/total sticking with the cushion abated (i.e., Wenzel state), as illustrated in Fig. 19b, which depends on the surface tension of the impacting liquid, impacting speed, surface structure and ambient conditions.299,302-306 It has also been demonstrated that the impalement of liquid droplet happens when its volume decreased due to evaporation (Fig. 19c), which is attributed to the increased Laplace pressure of small droplet.307-310 Vapor condensation on super liquid-repellent surfaces forms randomly distributed nanodroplets within rough textures, which gradually bridge together and grow to be droplets in the Wenzel wetting state (i.e., flooding condensation), resulting in the loss of liquid repellence when vapor condensation occurred or hot water contacted the surface (Fig. 19d).159,183,311,312 Meanwhile, condensation-induced blisters through nanoscale pinholes on the hydrophobic thin coatings will result in the delamination of the coatings if the condensed droplets cannot overcome the Laplace pressure barrier generated by the pinned three-phase contact line at the pinhole, which finally develop into the failure of liquid repellence.313-315 Another frequently-meet and significant situation for the wetting model transition is immersing the surface in the repelled liquid (either static or flowing), where a gradual disappearance of the cushion is observed (Fig. 19e), and this generally results from liquid static pressure, air diffusion driven by chemical potential gradient, and/or shear stress induced deformation/detachment of the air bubbles.283,316-319 Additionally, some other mechanisms, such as vibration,320,321 water hammer pressure,322-324 electrowetting,325-327 electrostatic attraction154 and electric field adaptive deformation,153 have also been reported to induce the cushion instability and thus wetting transition.\nFor the underwater superoleophobic surface, the locked water within the rough micro/nano structures serves as a repulsive cushion that prevents oil from contacting with the solid surface directly. The underwater Cassie-Baxter state for oil/water/solid wetting system is documented to be thermodynamically stable during long-term immersion in water,242,245,249,328 and the destruction of the water cushion has been rarely observed hitherto even if the testing oil droplet is severely pressured by a preloading force.247 However, as superoleophobicity underwater is closely connected with the superhydrophilicity in air (i.e., water hydration ability),19,64,237-240 it should be emphasized that superhydrophilic surfaces exposed to air often (not always) show thermodynamical instability,329-331 although the quantitative/qualitative relationship between the instability of water wettability in air and resultant change of underwater oil wettability has not been well-addressed yet. Superhydrophilic surface exposed to air tends to reorganize in order to minimize its interfacial energy to maintain equilibrium, this thermodynamically driven instability is extensively observed in plasma induced (super)hydrophilic modification, which is also termed as aging behavior, and some possible mechanisms for the instability are proposed, such as reorientation of polar groups, diffusion of low molecular weight species and adsorption of organic\ncontaminants from air.332-334 Chen et al. elucidated that the instability of superhydrophilic surfaces in air is closely related to the surface micro/nano structure, surface chemistry, ambient temperature and relative humidity, etc.330,331,335 It was also showed that storing in water favors the long-term stability of superhydrophilic surface (Fig. 20a),330 which is consistent with the ever-lasting underwater superoleophobicity (Fig. 20b).242,245,249,328\nThe infused liquid layer is critical for the liquid repellence of SLIS due to its defect-free and smooth features, and intrinsically immiscibility towards testing liquid, which nearly eliminates the pinning of liquid contact line.20 SLIS is reported to be surprisingly stable towards pressure up to ~ 680 atm, which is equivalent to the hydrostatic pressure at a depth of ~ 7 km.20 However, thermodynamic instability of the lubricant always leads to its depletion, which inevitably results in the failure of SLISs. Gravimetric drainage,279 evaporation,336,337 immersing in other liquids,338-340 and liquid droplets/jet impinging or sliding337,341,342 are mostly considered incentives for the lubricant loss. When a testing droplet is deposited on SLIS, the redistribution of the lubricant layer on the surfaces occurs, and the interconnected lubricant dynamics subsequently results in the formation of wetting ridge around the droplet. Then the movement of the droplet generates shear force and drags the lubricant meniscus downhill, which dominates the depletion of the lubricant.341 Tress et al. demonstrated that decreasing the lubricant thickness would increase the extra height of the wetting ridge, leading to the acceleration of lubricant depletion via droplet sliding.337 Kreder et al. found that the lubricant depletion rate was related to the capillary number of the two liquid-phases system (Ca = \u03b7v/\u03b3LV, where \u03b7, v, and \u03b3LV is the viscosity, velocity and surface tension of the droplet, respectively).341 Their findings showed that droplets with higher Ca deplete much less lubricant than slower-moving droplets on less viscous lubricants (Fig. 21a), indicating counterintuitively that those faster moving droplets created higher shearing force but less lubricant depletion. It was also demonstrated that the volume of the wetting ridge nearly equaled that of the lost lubricant (Fig. 21b), confirming that wetting ridge was the main source of lubricant depletion during a moving droplet swept\nacross a SLIS.\nAdera et al. studied the lubricant depletion caused by pendant water droplets on horizontal copper tube with nanostructured outside SLIS during condensation.342 They revealed that droplets falling from tube surface broke unequally and left behind small satellite droplets that retained the bulk of the lubricant in the wetting ridge (Fig. 21c and d), which was totally different from the droplets sliding off from tilted flat SLISs where the entire wetting ridge left the surface upon droplet departure. In addition, when eqn (14) was met, a highly non-uniform both spatially and temporally layer of lubricant wrapped on the droplet (i.e., cloaking). Although the lubricant depletion by cloaking layer was demonstrated to be much less than that by wetting ridge,341,342 it still needs to be well considered in terms of the thermodynamic durability of SLIS."

For example, superhydrophobic clothes will inevitably be rubbed by hands, stretched and bended; superhydrophobic windshield of a car will suffer from the impacting of raindrops and sands blown by the wind; medical implants with SLISs often serve under severe abrasion with tissues, to name a few. However, if the surface textures are highly susceptible to external forces caused by rubbing, impacting, stretching, peeling, etc., different morphological changes like abrasion, rupture, flattening and exfoliation will be generated, leading to increased sticking or even spreading of the testing liquid and thus the loss of liquid repellence. Consequently, the mechanical robustness and durability, which imply the ability of liquid-repellent surfaces to withstand the destructions of surface textures and/or chemistries under continuous external force action, are practically important for these surfaces. Usually, according to the direct results of the force action, mechanical durability testing methods can be classified as tangential abrasion, dynamic impacting, tape peeling, substrate deformation, etc., which are depicted in Fig. 22."

            "text": "Contact and relative motion between two solid surfaces always generates tangential abrasion, a common condition that liquid-repellent surfaces often encounter during real use. Dynamic friction between the contact points causes material removal, leading to gradual flattening of the rough textures and/or depletion of the infused liquid, which finally gives rise to the loss of the liquid repellence with abrasion-dependent extent. Various methods and setups have been reported to perform tangential abrasion test of liquid-repellent surfaces, such as simple finger wiping, manual sandpaper abrasion, automatic tribometer abrasion, scratch by hard tips, etc.\nFinger wiping (Fig. 22a) is reported in the literature to simulate rubbing on liquid-repellent surfaces,54,269,343-345 and Fig. 22b shows a finger rubbing induced surface morphology damage on a spray-coated superhydrophobic coating.345 Although natural secretions like sweat and oil exist on fingers,43,346 they can be neglected or eliminated by wearing a glove in the wiping test. Finger wiping is a simple method where no special requirements are needed, but it is difficult to control the applied pressure and to evaluate the mechanical durability quantificationally.\nSandpaper abrasion (Fig. 22c) is probably the most widely selected mechanical durability testing method in the literature,43,54,67,244,352-357 as it does not require specialized or professional equipment, and can offer quantitative analysis of the robustness. Typically, the liquid-repellent surface is placed face-down to a sandpaper, and a loading is applied on the solid substrate to provide normal pressure, then the substrate is moved along the tangential direction with a certain speed and distance. Longitudinal and then transverse abrasion or vice versa is suggested to be defined as one abrasion cycle.54 Abrasion degree from the sandpaper can be adjusted by the grit number (i.e., granularity) of sandpaper, the mass of applied loading (i.e., pressure), and the speed and distance of each abrasion cycle. Fig. 22d illustrates the SEM images of a spray-coated commercial superhydrophobic coating (Neverwet) before and after sandpaper abrasion under a pressure of 10 kPa for 4.0 m, showing obvious surface textures damage and thus a CA decreasing from 156\u00b0 to 92\u00b0.52 However, sandpaper abrasion is sometimes time-consuming when too many abrasion cycles are required, especially for those abrasion-tolerant surfaces. Moreover, sandpaper abrasion is a full-manual testing process and is thereby susceptible to operator error, making it difficult to compare the robustness of different liquid-repellent surfaces.\nLinear and circular abrasions by tribometer (Fig. 22e, g) are recently popular in mechanical durability testing of liquid-repellent surfaces due to their advantages in automation and qualitative analysis.43,47,269,291,349,354,356,358 For example, Wang et al. showed that superhydrophobic surfaces coated with commercial Ultra-Ever Dry coating lost their super water repellence after 100 cycles linear abrasions due to nearly complete removal of the surface micro/nano structures (Fig. 22f).47 Peng et al. performed the circular abrasion of an all-organic superhydrophobic nanocomposite coatings using an ASTM standard (D4060) Taber abrasion technique, and found that the area under drastic abrasion (100 cycles) suffered from obvious plastic deformation (Fig. 22h), leading to the partial loss of their superhydrophobicity.291 These tests are generally conducted as follows: the testing surface is fixed upward on the sample platform of a standard equipment (e.g., Taber abrasion machine), and then the abradant (e.g., steel ball, indenter and abrasive wheels) makes contact with the surface under a normal loading, following which the abrasion testing starts automatically under to-and-fro feed movement of the abradant or rotation of the platform with the pre-set loading and speed. Linear and circular abrasions by tribometer could reduce operator error, enabling them to be preferable in evaluation of robustness towards tangential abrasion, especially in multiple abrasion cycles testing.\nScratch by hard tips (e.g., blade, knife, screwdriver, indenter, etc.) is another common testing method for mechanical durability of liquid-repellent surfaces.47,54,56,269,352,356-359 For example, Wang et al. showed that indenter scratch under normal load of 10 N (Fig. 22i) could severely damage the micropillars of a superhydrophobic surface (Fig. 22j), resulting in the decrease of water CA from ~ 160\u00b0 to ~ 120\u00b0 and droplet pinning,47 while knife scratch has little influence on the liquid repellence of SLISs due to their self-healing ability.56,269 Though this method is easy to be operated, it can hardly provide quantitative evaluation of the robustness, and the density of the scratches (i.e., the scratched area) is rarely considered in previous publications."

For example, the raindrops in a thunderstorm have maximum diameters of 4\u20135 mm, and the impacting speed reaches up to 7\u20139 m s\u22121 on a solid surface with a frequency of 3.88 \u00d7 105 drops m\u22122 h\u22121.360 Intensive impacting could cause fracture of the surface textures and/or removal of the infused-liquid of the liquid-repellent surfaces, which could negatively affect their liquid repellence. Therefore, much attention has to be paid to the dynamic impacting induced potential fragility, and some artificial impacting methods are proposed to address this issue, including falling sand, liquid droplet, liquid jet, etc.43,44,284\nFalling sand impacting is often employed to study the influence of solid particles impacting on liquid-repellent surfaces.217,218,270,349,353,361-363 As depicted in Fig. 22k, in this testing, the liquid-repellent surface is fixed with a tilting angle (usually 45\u00b0), and the pre-collected sand is placed in a container and located above the surface, then the sand is dropped down, accelerated by gravity and finally impacts on the surface. As reported by Wu et al., one of their superhydrophobic coatings lost its superhydrophobicity (water CA decreased from ~ 164\u00b0 to ~ 140\u00b0, while SA increased from < 10\u00b0 to 24\u00b0) after falling sand impacting, due to obvious flattening of the surface rough structures (Fig. 22l).218 Wu et al. showed that falling sand impacting invalidated the liquid repellence and biofouling resistance of a SLIS (perfluoropolyether oil infused porous PTFE membranes),270 which probably originated from the cooperative effect of rough structures change and lubricant depletion. Impacting energy (i.e., velocity) of the falling sand is mainly affected by the falling height,217,218 which partly determines the impacting force and thereby the damage degree to the liquid-repellent surfaces. However, the hitherto reported maximum falling height is 1.1 m,349 corresponding to an impacting velocity of ~ 4.7 m s\u22121, which is far below the typical sand speed in a sandstorm (> 10 m s\u22121).364\nHigh speed liquid droplet/jet impacting is also frequently used for the mechanical durability testing of liquid-repellent surfaces (Fig. 22m). As discussed in Section 3.1, liquid droplet/jet impacting can trigger thermodynamic instability of super liquid-repellent surfaces via cushions removal induced Cassie-Baxter to Wenzel transition,299,302-306 as well as the drainage of the infused-liquid due to commonly observed meniscus and cloaking.341 It should be emphasized that the interaction between dynamic liquids (including droplet, jet, and flow) and liquid-repellent surfaces could have a negative effect on their surface textures and/or infused-liquid due to the generated shear force, which sometimes leads to the loss of liquid repellence.47,217,291,355,363,365-368 Notably, this is different from the meniscus and cloaking induced infused-liquid depletion of SLIS, which should be, more precisely, considered as a thermodynamic process."

Tape peeling is a common\napproach used to assess the bonding strength between liquid-repellent coatings and solid substrates.291,349,350,355,363,367,368 As depicted in Fig. 22n, the substrate is placed horizontally to the liquid-repellent coating upward, then adhesive tape is applied and uniformly pressed (usually by using a cylindrical block as a roller) for a while to adhere to the underneath coating, following which the tape is peeled off. Based on this testing, both the coating removal rate (e.g., according to the ASTM standard D3359-17) and wettability change of the surface can be obtained. For example, Qing et al. showed that when a superhydrophobic 1,1,2,2-tetrahydroperfluorodecyltrimethoxysilane-TiO2/PDMS coating was directly deposited on glass substrate, it could be easily removed by tape peeling, which obviously decreased its water repellence (Fig. 22o).350\nTape peeling can quantitatively evaluate the resistance of liquid-repellent coating towards mechanical peeling-off, and its result is significantly affected by the adhesive ability of the tape, and the pressing force. Peng et al. used Elcometer 99 tape (with adhesion to steel value of 642 N m\u22121) and VHB tape (with adhesion to steel value of 2600 N m\u22121) to test the peeling-off resistance of a robust superhydrophobic coating, and found that the two tapes had little influence on the superhydrophobicity, but it should be noted that the former one did not remove any coatings, whereas a small part of the coating (less than 5%) was removed onto the later one.291 However, these influencing factors are rarely considered comprehensively throughout the literature, making the tape peeling indication of robustness of liquid repellence incomparable and even sometimes unconvincing."

Generally, rigid substrates (e.g., metals) are extremely sensitive to deformation due to their poor plasticity and elasticity, so little attention has been paid to the robustness of liquid-repellent surfaces on rigid substrates towards mechanical stretching or compressing, except some publications on bendable superhydrophobic metallic matrix.371,372 By contrast, soft substrates (e.g., silicone elastomer and fabric) often possess excellent flexibility, enabling them to be preferably selected to create liquid-repellent surfaces that are used in conditions with complex mechanical deformation. Typically, reconstruction (e.g., sparsification and densification), rupture, or even peeling-off of the rough structures could be observed during the deformation of flexible substrates, which may sometimes lead to the loss of liquid repellence depending on the deformation.373-376 For example, Zang et al. prepared superhydrophobic crumpled graphene layer on an elastic film of VHB acrylic 4905, and the water CA decreased from 152\u00b0 to 103\u00b0 when the substrate was biaxially stretched with a tensile strain of 400% due to the reduced surface roughness during graphene unfolding.373 3.2.5 Others Besides the above-discussed testing methods, other techniques can also be found in the literature for the mechanical durability testing of liquid-repellent surfaces. Laundering in detergent or water is often used\nin mechanical durability testing of liquid-repellent fabrics,346,355,377 as it represents the most common mechanical interaction of fabrics during their use. Laundering can create composite testing conditions containing solid-solid abrasion, solid-liquid abrasion, liquid impacting, substrate deformation, detergent adsorption, etc., indicating that a relatively overall evaluation of the mechanical durability can be obtained. Ultrasonic processing can physically damage fragile surface structures or even break off the coatings that have poor adhesion with substrates, thereby making it an alternative candidate for mechanical durability testing of liquid-repellent surfaces.378,379 Some groups also tested the mechanical durability of liquid-repellent surfaces by hammer punching,66,359 which can roughly evaluate the robustness towards transient and huge impact pressure. In addition, spinning is always used to apply vigorous centrifugal/shear force to the infused lubricant on SLISs, so as to accelerate the lubricant depletion, which can be therefore employed to test the robustness of SLISs.338-340"

            "text": "Potential chemical processes have to be prudently considered for the real applications of liquid-repellent surfaces, especially under some harsh conditions, since they could cause a change in surface textures and/or surface chemistry, resulting in deterioration of the liquid repellence. For example, building walls with Lotus leaf-like self-cleaning ability are often exposed to direct sunlight and acid rain, ship hulls with drag-reduced surfaces are always immersed in corrosive seawater, superhydrophobic transmission lines may suffer from extremely low temperature, and so on. Chemical durability here refers to the resistance of liquid-repellent surfaces towards various chemical invasions, and it is vitally important to be emphasized. 3.3.1 Acid/alkaline/salty solutions corrosion Artificial chemical corrosion by aqueous solutions, including acid (e.g., HCl, H2SO4 and aqua regia), alkaline (e.g., NaOH and KOH) and saline (e.g., NaCl), are widely employed to test the chemical durability of liquid-repellent surfaces. Depositing corrosive liquid droplets on liquid-repellent surface and measuring their CAs on the surface is a simple method to estimate the chemical durability, but the results are sometimes unconvincing since the time interval during the droplet deposition and CA measurement is always too short to trigger the possible chemical processes between the corrosive liquids and the surfaces. Additionally, when chemical corrosion occurs between the corrosive liquid droplets and the surfaces, the measured CAs are always time-dependent, making it difficult to evaluate the chemical stability. Therefore, this method is advisable for the proof of highly chemical instability or transitory stability, but not for the chemical resistance assessment of long-term stable surfaces. By contrast, immersing the liquid-repellent surfaces into corrosive solutions for a certain period and then depicting their wettability could be a relatively reliable way to evaluate the chemical resistance. For example, Cheng et al. fabricated superhydrophobic fabrics by enzyme etching and subsequent methyltrichlorosilane modification, and tested their chemical durability via the two methods.380 They showed that no obvious CA change was observed when HCl (pH = 2), NaCl (pH = 7) and NaOH (pH = 12) droplets were deposited on the superhydrophobic fabrics, but drastic water CA decrease was displayed after the fabrics were immersed in\nHCl (pH = 2) and NaOH (pH = 12) for 24 h. Additionally, it has to be noted that the chemical resistance of underwater superoleophobic surfaces could be well characterised by oil CA measurement in corrosive aqueous solutions, because the samples are pre-immersed in and totally soaked by the corrosive solutions.\nAnother technique to test the chemical resistance of liquid-repellent surface is accelerated electrochemical corrosion in corrosive solutions (e.g., 3.5 wt% NaCl solution) on an electrochemical workstation, during which potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) can be obtained.48,296,381 Generally, a three-electrode configuration, with liquid-repellent surface as the working electrode (WE), a platinum electrode as the counter electrode (CE), and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode (RE), is used in this testing. Corrosion current density (Icorr) and corrosion potential (Ecorr) obtained from the PDP curve can directly reflect the corrosion resistance of the tested sample, and the corresponding corrosion rate (CR, mm a\u22121) could be obtained by the formula below:\ncorr 3725 = I M\nCR V\n \n (31)\nwhere M, \u03c1, and V is respectively the molar mass, density, and valence state of the tested substrates. In general, samples with better corrosion resistance show lower Icorr and CR but higher Ecorr values. Based on the EIS results, many useful data can be collected to evaluate the corrosion behavior of the tested samples, such as the Nyquist plots and corresponding equivalent circuit models, Bode plots of impedance modulus (|Z|) vs frequency and phase angle vs frequency, etc. For example, it was demonstrated that the larger diameter of capacitive loop in the Nyquist plot and bigger value of |Z| at low frequency (e.g., |Z| at f = 0.01 Hz, termed as |Z|f = 0.01 Hz) in the Bode plot revealed the better corrosion resistance. Moreover, the Bode phase angle plots indicated that the samples with the better corrosion resistance had higher and more stable phase angle maxima across a wider range of frequency. For example, Yang et al. studied the anticorrosive performance of superhydrophobic and slippery coatings on 316L stainless steel via accelerated electrochemical corrosion.382 Laser textured 316L steel surface was functionalized by 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane to obtain superhydrophobic surface, which was subsequently infused by silicon oil to construct SLIS. The PDP test results (Fig. 23a) showed that the SLIS possessed the lowest Icorr (1.61 \u00d7 10 \u22128 A cm\u22122), which was about 30-fold smaller than the superhydrophobic surface (4.70 \u00d7 10\u22127 A cm\u22122) and 300-fold smaller than the original surface (4.56 \u00d7 10\u22126 A cm\u22122), and the polarization resistance of SLIS (2327.42 k\u03a9 cm2) > superhydrophobic surface (83.16 k\u03a9 cm2) > original surface (13.23 k\u03a9 cm2). The EIS testing results showed that compared with the original steel substrate (Fig. 23b), the SLIS presented the best corrosion resistance due to its largest capacitive loop, followed by the superhydrophobic surface (Fig. 23c). In addition, as shown in Fig. 23d, the Bode plot of |Z| vs frequency showed that in the low frequency the SLIS had the |Z| of 105.58 \u03a9 cm2, which was larger than the superhydrophobic surface (104.76 \u03a9 cm2) as well as the original surface (103.19 \u03a9 cm2). Overall, the accelerated electrochemical corrosion testing could provide more quantifiable data based on PDP and EIS,\nenabling us to evaluate the chemical durability of liquid-repellent surfaces quantificationally and convincingly."

            "heading": "3.3.2 Exposure to UV and active species",
            "text": "Exposing to UV is an extensive method to evaluate the chemical durability of liquid-repellent surfaces in the literature. Direct irradiation by UV lamp or sunlight is employed to conduct the evaluation of UV-resistance for liquid-repellent surfaces.72,218,271,383 Testing parameters, such as wavelength and intensity of the UV light, exposure duration, and the distance between UV source and surface, are generally considered. If the matrix materials and/or surface functional groups of liquid-repellent surfaces are degradable towards UV, the surfaces will lose their liquid repellence after UV treatment.384-386 For example, thiols, which are widely used to lower surface energy, tend to be oxidized over short timescales when exposed to UV radiation, turning into disulfides and sulfonates that can be washed away easily by polar solvents such as water.387 Kong et al. fabricated superoleophobic/superhydrophilic coatings on cotton fabric and sponge by liquid-phase deposition of TiO2 nanoparticles that were subsequently decorated with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA).385 Upon exposure to UV, TiO2 with \u00b7OH radicals and holes (h+) could oxidize the adsorbed PFOA long chains via defluorination cycle reaction, which finally turned the surface to be both superoleophilic and superhydrophilic. By contrast, Kim et al. prepared superhydrophobic coatings on various pre-roughened metals by depositing PDMS that was vaporized with the aid of ammonium bicarbonate.388 Although the surfaces retained their superhydrophobicity after\n5 days of UV irradiation, they became superhydrophilic upon treatment by UV-ozone, which might be attributed to the strong oxidation effect of ozone. Therefore, reactive gas can also cause chemical damage for liquid-repellent surfaces. Recently, a superamphiphobic surface composed of Ti\u2013O\u2013Ti networks, hydrophobic titanium\u2013carboxylate coordination complexes, and fluorinate-rich molecular chains was reported to be partially damaged by NH3 exposure. 389 Due to the cleavage of a titanium\u2013carboxylate coordination complex and the generation of ammonium carboxylate by NH3-triggered surface reactions, the polar component of the surface free energy (\u03b3s d) decreased while the polar component (\u03b3s p) increased, and the dipolar-dipolar interaction between water molecules and formed ammonium carboxylate was enhanced, driving the water droplets to quickly spread on the treated surface.\nAs ionized gases, plasmas contain various energetic particles and highly reactive species, such as electrons, ions, excited groups, and metastable atoms/molecules, which enables them to be versatile sources to trigger interfacial physiochemical processes including physical/chemical etching, deposition, oxidation, etc. The specific plasma-target interfacial reactions heavily depend on the properties of plasmas. Generally, plasmas containing oxygen-based active species can oxidize liquid-repellent surfaces by incorporating oxygen-containing polar groups, such as \u2013OH and \u2013COOH, which thereby deteriorate their liquid repellence.225,330,356,390 Oxygen, air or water vapor are often used as working gas directly or an additive to carrier gas (e.g., nitrogen, helium, and argon) to generate oxygen-containing plasmas via gas discharge.\nAdditionally, polydopamine, a well-known substrate-independent adhesive that can attach to various materials through strong coordinative interactions, can also change the wettability of liquid-repellent surfaces due to the radicals generated during the oxidative polymerization of dopamine.391,392 For example, Prieto-L\u00f3pez et al. reported that when silicon-based SLISs prepared by swelling PDMS with silicon oil were placed in dopamine buffer solution containing NaOH, the surface hydrophobicity was changed and a polydopamine coating was observed on the damaged surface.391 The authors found that the alkaline pH, the presence of Na+ cations in the coating solution together with the active sites present in the polydopamine structure (i.e., \u2013OH, =O, \u2013NH, and \u2013NH2), and especially various radical species generated during oxidative polymerization of dopamine, enabled the penetration of polydopamine particles through the lubricant layer, which further promoted the cleavage of the Si\u2013O bond or C\u2013H bond of the PDMS matrix and the subsequent anchoring of the dopamine/polydopamine species. 3.3.3 Others Besides the aforementioned frequently-used testing methods, some other methods, such as organic solvents invasion and high/low temperature exposure, are also employed to evaluate the chemical durability of liquid-repellent surfaces. When organic solvents make contact with liquid-repellent surfaces, complete repelling or potential physicochemical processes may occur, such as adsorption of the solvents, dissolution or swelling of the substrate and/or the surface coating, etc., making it necessary to test the durability of liquid repellence towards organic solvents.346,372,393 If the liquid-repellent surfaces possess complete repellence towards the testing organic solvents, they would be insusceptible to the invasion of\nthe solvents.17,20,188,231 For example, Pan et al. prepared hierarchically structured surfaces by using an electrospun coating of cross-linked PDMS + 50 wt% fluorodecyl polyhedral oligomeric silsequioxane on top of stainless steel wire meshes.231 The resultant surface showed superamphiphobicity with virtually all liquids - organic or inorganic, polar or nonpolar, Newtonian or non-Newtonian, and jets of a range of different liquids could easily bounce on the surfaces. The super repellent surface with doubly re-entrant structures reported by Liu et al. showed excellent repellence to almost all available liquids, which enabled the surface to be chemically stable towards the invasion by even completely wetting organic solvents.188 By contrast, when the tested surfaces can be (partially) wetted by or react with the testing organic solvents, their liquid repellence would be damaged. For example, Wang et al. prepared a superamphiphobic surface on cotton fabric by dip-coating a mixed suspension of fluorodecyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes, TiO2 and PTFE particles, and showed that the water CA of the fabric decreased from 164\u00b0 to 128\u00b0 after being contaminated by oleic acid.346 Cross-linked PDMS, which is typically used as a coating with low surface energy for superhydrophobic surface or a versatile matrix for SLIS, has been demonstrated to be unstable upon organic solvents (e.g., toluene, chloroform, and silicon oil) invasion.231,280,281,347 In addition, for a SLIS with infused lubricant (Liquid A) and a testing organic solvent (Liquid B), if their surface tensions cannot meet eqns (12) and (14), the SLIS will be seriously damaged.85,86\nMost liquid-repellent surfaces are characterised at room temperature, but the practical service conditions of these surfaces often involve high/low temperature. Extreme temperature exposure can lead to changes in surface morphology and/or chemistry, and thereby bring a potential threat to the stability of their liquid repellence.372,394 For instance, Chandekar et al. studied the thermal stability of self-assembled thiol and silane monolayers, and found that these monolayers would be decomposed at evaluated temperatures, e.g., self-assembled 1-octadecanethiol and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane monolayers started to decompose at ~ 110 \u00b0C and 350 \u00b0C, respectively,395 indicating that the durability of thiol or silane functionalized liquid-repellent surfaces under high temperatures have to be well considered. Therefore, it is also important to study the stability of the wettability under high/low temperature treatment. Generally, a high and low temperature environment test chamber or hot platform can be used to provide continuously variable temperatures typically ranging from dozens of degrees below zero to a few hundred degrees above zero. Liquid nitrogen is always used to create extremely low temperature (\u2212196 \u00b0C), while flame burning is sometimes employed to simulate high temperature source. After exposing the liquid-repellent surfaces in pre-set testing temperature for a certain period of time, the samples are then restored to room temperature, after which the changes of surface wettability are measured to evaluate their stability towards high/low temperature treatment. For example, Li et al. prepared a superhydrophobic coating by spraying the suspension containing epoxy resin modified silicone resin and its curing agent, multilayer graphene oxide, lamellar mica powders, and octadecyltrichlorosilane functionalized SiO2 nanoparticles. 296 The obtained superhydrophobic coating could retain its excellent water repellence even after 12 cycles of storage in liquid nitrogen for 10 min and subsequently on a hot\nplatform at 200 \u00b0C for 10 min, which was attributed to the durable surface structures and compositions during extremely large and rapid temperature changes. Notably, extreme temperature treatment induced chemical instability is different from vapor condensation caused thermodynamic instability (i.e., flooding).\nIn addition, chemical degradations of the hydrophobic coatings of super liquid-repellent surfaces during water vapor condensation have also drawn much attention in recent years.315,396-399. For example, Wang et al. studied the condensation-induced chemical degradation and failure of organofunctional silane (including trichloro(octadecyl)silane and trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl) silane) self-assembled monolayer coatings on Si/SiO2 substrate. 399 The authors found that silane-uncoated defects within the coatings were generated during the synthesis of the coatings in uncontrolled environments with unregulated water/moisture content, and these defects favored the condensed water to dissolve and hydrolyze the Si\u2212O\u2212Si bonds at the coating-solid interface, leading to partial detachment of the cross-linked silane agglomerates from the surface, which thereby acted as nucleation sites for degradation of the silane functionalized liquid-repellent coating. By conducting the silane coatings in an anhydrous/moisture-free environment, the authors effectively improved the chemical durability of the coatings under condensation conditions, and realized enhanced condensation heat transfer over an extended period of time.399,400\nAlthough plentiful of liquid-repellent surfaces have been reported and their robustness and durability have also been evaluated skillfully, most of the tests are only conducted on lab-scale with limited testing intensity (e.g., immersion under static water for several hours, or gentle sandpaper abrasion for dozens of cycles) that are far from the requirements for real-world applications, making it necessary to emphasize that long-term and repeated testing (e.g., 80 days immersion under water, or 25000 cycles Martindale abrasion according to ASTM D4966)47,288,401-404 that are in good accordance with practical application requirements, which are urgently demanded to promote the development of \u201creal\u201d robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces."

            "text": "As for liquid-repellent surfaces, the chemistry of the underneath solid substrate is sometimes unrelated to the surface wettability, but they are important to the robustness and durability of the liquid repellence. Intuitively, using intrinsically hard/wear-resistant material can allow for construction of mechanically\nrobust liquid-repellent surfaces, while materials with naturally chemical inertness can be helpful to get chemically durable liquid-repellent surfaces. For example, Ye et al. synthesized amphiphilic vitrimer via base-catalyzed ring-opening between pristine and epoxy-modified biobased malic acid, which were then transformed into superhydrophilic vitrimer membrane after dry-pressing and sintering.406 Similar to classical epoxy resins, the vitrimer epoxy resin possessed excellent mechanical durability and chemical inertness, which further endowed the resultant membrane with robust and durable underwater superoleophobicity towards sandpaper abrasion (Fig. 24a, b) and immersion in corrosive media (such as aqua regia and NaOH solutions). Concrete, a widely-used engineering materials with exceptional strength and good durability, has been used to construct a robust and durable superhydrophobic surface, which could tolerate various testing under harsh conditions, such as sandpaper abrasion, knife scratch, hammer beat, sand impacting, tape peeling, and concentrated acid/alkali/salt immersion.66,407,408 Chen et al. proposed a multi-fluorination strategy to prepare all-organic superhydrophobic coatings consisting of fluorinated epoxy resin, perfluoropolyether and polytetrafluoroethylene nanoparticles (Fig. 24c).291 The addition of the perfluoropolyether improved the mechanical flexibility of the coating, which imparted the coating with impalement resistance to high-speed droplets and turbulent water jets at least up to ~ 35 m s\u22121 and a Weber number of ~ 43,000 due to the flexibility-induced cushioning of pressure peaks. In addition, the choice of the all-organic raw materials with inherent chemical stability imparted the coating with excellent chemical durability, and the coating maintained a water CA of > 150\u00b0 after 60 min immersion in aqua regia (Fig. 24d) and 12 h corrosion in 1 M NaOH (Fig. 24e). By mimicking natural nacre which exhibited exceptional mechanical and chemical performance due to biomineralization-induced hierarchical organization of organic matrix and inorganic aragonite component, Chen and co-authors reported a mechanically robust underwater superoleophobic film via superspreading and biomineralization strategies (Fig. 24f, g).67,409,410 The prepared film was composed of aragonite platelets as the inorganic component and chitosan derivative as the organic framework, and showed outstanding robustness and durability in terms of long-term immersion in high salt solution or seawater, and intensive impingement by falling sands (Fig. 24h).\nSurface chemistry is one of the dominant factors that determines the wettability of materials.411,412 Silanes, thiols, and fatty acids containing CH- and CF-based groups are always employed to reduce the surface energy of a roughened surface to fabricate super liquid-repellent surfaces. Silanes are more stable due to their covalent bonding with the underlying surface, but thiols are generally less stable under ambient conditions, UV exposure or thermal treatment.387,395 In addition, it was demonstrated that the surface free energy of these groups decreased in the order \u2212CH2\u2212 > \u2212CH3 > \u2212CF2\u2212 > \u2212CF2H > \u2212CF3, and that increasing the chain length could further decrease the surface energy.413,414 Samanta et al. studied the influence of surface chemistry on wettability of a laser-textured aluminum alloy.415 They found that fluorinated groups (\u2212CF2\u2212 and \u2212CF3 with very low dispersive and nondispersive surface energy) anchored the rough surface resulting in both water and diiodomethane repellence; polar nitrile group (\u2212C\u2261N with very high nondispersive and high dispersive surface energy) attachment leads to both\nsuperhydrophilicity and superoleophilicity; anchoring fluorinated groups (\u2212CF2\u2212 and \u2212CF3) and polar sodium carboxylate (\u2212COONa) together created very low dispersive and very high nondispersive surface energy components, resulting in the coexistence of water affinity and diiodomethane repellence. Wang et al. modified laser-roughened stainless steel surfaces respectively with stearic acid (CH3(CH2)16COOH) and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane (CF3(CF2)7CH2CH2SiCl3) to fabricate superhydrophobic surfaces, and they found that the two surfaces possessed similar water repellence, but the fluoroalkylsilane modified one showed better chemical durability towards aqueous solution corrosion.48\nIn addition, the use of CF-based compounds results in massive release of fluorine-compounds in natural environment, which has caused serious and recurrent threats to human health, such as the causation for cancer, disruptions of immune systems, and reproductive problems.416 Consequently, fluorine-compounds are going to be banned in the European Union shortly,417 indicating extremely timely and significant demand to realize liquid repellence with non-fluorinated surface chemistry. Materials with\nCH-based groups that possess low surface tensions (e.g., PDMS, polypropylene, silicone oligomer and stearic acid) are thereby promising candidates for the fabrication of fluorine-free liquid-repellent surfaces.292,418-421 Wu et al. reported a fluorine-free superhydrophobic coating prepared by spray-coating copper alkylcarboxylates, Cu(CH3(CH2)10COO)2. 422 When the emulsion solution of (CH3(CH2)10COO)2Cu with a concentration of 0.04 M in a mixed solvent of ethanol and water (volume ratio 1:1) was sprayed on various substrates and dried completely, the obtained coatings showed water CA of 158 \u00b1 2\u00b0 and SA of 5 \u00b1 1.4\u00b0 due to the resultant binary micro/nanostructures (microscale papillas and nanoscale rods) and the CH-based groups induced low surface energy. Cao et al. prepared a fluorine-free superhydrophobic fabric by depositing organically modified silica aerogel (ormosil) thin film onto the fabric and subsequently coating PDMS.423 The PDMS layer not only increased the binding strength between the hierarchical ormosil film and fabric, but also lowered the surface energy of the sample, resulting in a mechanically robust and chemically durable superhydrophobic fabric. In addition, materials with CH-based groups can also be used to build 3D blocks with liquid repellence. For instance, Zhang et al. reported a press-in-mold method to fabricate non-fluorinated superhydrophobic blocks via dispersing hydrophobic SiO2 nanoparticles in polymers. 46 Hydrophobic SiO2 nanoparticles functionalized by hexamethyldisilazane were dispersed in various polymers including polyhexamethylene adipamide, polystyrene, polypropylene, and methyl silicone resin. After drying and then pressing in a mold, hard free-standing blocks were obtained, which became superhydrophobic after removing the outermost layer by sandpaper abrasion. The whole fabrication process did not include any fluorinated materials, and the superhydrophobic blocks could retain their super water repellence after knife/file scratching, liquid nitrogen testing, severe sand/water impacting, acidic/alkali corrosion and 20 m sandpaper abrasion. However, it is still a challenge to prepare fluorine-free superoleophobic surface in air, unless special doubly/triply re-entrant microstructures are employed,188,191,424 which can be found in Section 4.2.2.\nThe underwater superoleophobicity can also be influenced by surface chemistry. Cheng et al. studied the underwater oil wettability of nanostructured copper that was modified by mixed thiols containing both HS(CH2)9CH3 and HS(CH2)11OH, and the results showed that surfaces with controlled oil wettability from underwater superoleophilicity to underwater superoleophobicity could be achieved by simply changing the concentration of HS(CH2)11OH in the mixed solution. 425 Zhao et al. further reported under-oil superhydrophobicity and underwater superoleophobicity coexisted copper surface by designing conformational transitions of surface self-assembled molecules.246 The authors modified Cu(OH)2 nanowire structured Cu plate in the ethanol solution of 1 mM different hydroxythiol (HS(CH2)nOH, where n is the number of methylene groups) for 5 h to prepare superwettable surface. The authors selected the following hydroxythiol: \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (n = 2), 3-mercapto-1-propanol (n = 3), 4-mercapto-1-butanol (n = 4), 6-mercapto-1-hexanol (n = 6), 9-mercapto-1-nonanol (n = 9), and 11-mercapto-1-undecanol (n = 11). Owing to the solvation effects, self-assembled hydroxythiol molecules underwent conformational reorientations in response to the external solvent environments. When the sheet was placed in water, the \u2212OH groups exposed on the surface could form hydrogen bonds with water\nto form a stable solid-water composite interface, meaning that the surfaces modified with different hydroxythiol showed underwater superoleophobicity (Fig. 25a). In oily environments, the solubility of oil in hydrocarbons allowed it to penetrate into the ordered self-assembled molecule structure and triggered molecular conformation transition, which resulted in the mask of the hydrophilic groups (\u2212OH) by hydrophobic \u2212CH2\u2212 groups (Fig. 25b). When n < 4, the short \u2212CH2\u2212 chain could not completely block the \u2212OH groups, so water molecules could still combine with the remaining hydrophilic groups, and the surface showed under-oil superhydrophilicity. By contrast, when n \u2265 4, the chain bending caused the \u2212OH groups to be completely covered by the \u2212CH2\u2212 groups, and the surface exhibited under-oil superhydrophobicity. Recently, by controlling the surface hydrophobic-hydrophilic heterogeneous chemistry, programmable super-antiwetting evolutions in oil-water-air system from single to quadruple super repellence have also been reported.389\nAlterations in the chemistry of superhydrophobic surfaces is a strategy to stabilize lubricants in porous structures of SLIS. Hydrophobically modified substrates show high chemical affinity towards oils, and therefore lubricants are able to wet surfaces completely and also could be stably locked into porous structures. Liu et al. reported a robust SLIS by infusing perfluoropolyether (PFPE) into porous PTFE nanostructures via a spin-coating method.426 In this study, nanoscale PTFE coatings were used as porous structures, and PFPE was used as the lubricating oil. A uniform and dense PTFE layer exhibited similar chemical affinity towards PFPE, which was beneficial to stabilize lubricants into PTFE nanostructures. After being subjected to different mechanical damages, including wiping, sandpaper abrasion (Fig. 26a) and knife scratch, the SLIS remained repellent to water (Fig. 26b) and n-decane, exhibiting excellent mechanical stability. Different from the above remarkable work, Maji et al. reported that SLIS with hydrophilic porous layers were capable of stabilizing infused lubricants as well.383 The hydrophilic\nporous interfaces (water CA of ~ 20\u00b0) were prepared by depositing chemically reactive nanocomplexes with acrylate groups onto glass substrates. After infusing silicone oils (AR20) into the porous layers, the inherently hydrophilic surfaces immediately became slippery with a water CA of ~ 83\u00b0 and a tilting angle of ~ 4\u00b0. In this design, the residual hydrophobic acrylate groups played an important role in stabilization of the oil phase and compatibility with other kinds of oils, though chemically reactive nanocomplexes showed hydrophilicity. The as-prepared SLIS remained highly robust after exposure to physical or chemical damages, such as tape peeling, sandpaper abrasion, UV irradiation and corrosive solutions.\nOn the other hand, the surface chemistry of SLISs was primarily determined by the infused lubricant layer. Besides the consideration of surface tensions to prepare SLISs as described in eqns (12) and (14), some other physical properties of the lubricants (vapor pressure, viscosity, etc.) should also be considered. For example, Zhao et al. investigated the effect of volatility of infused lubricant oils towards the robustness of the SLIS.427 For oils that were infused into hydrophobic nanostructured underlayers, such as pump oil (vapor pressure: 6.72 \u00d7 10\u22126 kPa), silicone oil (0.7 kPa) and perfluoropolyether (Krytox GPL105, ~ 10\u22128 kPa), they were of low volatility. When slippery surfaces infused with these lubricants were\nexposed to evaporation at temperature of 75 \u00b0C for 7 days (Fig. 26c) and continuous water-flow shear for 600 minutes (Fig. 26d), these surfaces still exhibited remarkable liquid repellence. Conversely, after hydrophobic porous layers were filled with high-volatility oils, such as petroleum ether (7.99 kPa), cyclohexane (10.31 kPa), and toluene (2.9 kPa), lubricants were prone to be evaporated from the SLIS in a short time even at room temperature. Finally, these slippery surfaces were transformed into hydrophobic surfaces, showing unstable performance of oils retention. Ouyang et al. discussed the effects of dimethyl silicone oils with different viscosities towards anti-corrosion and anti-biofouling performances.429 High-viscosity dimethyl silicone oils (viscosity: 350 mPa\u00b7s) were demonstrated to possess better corrosion and biofouling inhibition performance than that of low-viscosity oils (50100 mPa\u00b7s) for a long term. Sett et al. prepared a robust nanostructured fluorinated SLIS for vapor condensation of ethanol and hexane.428 They demonstrated that low-viscosity oils (Krytox GPL 100, 23 mPa\u00b7s) were quickly depleted from the slippery surfaces during steam condensation and high-viscosity lubricants (Krytox 1525, 496 mPa\u00b7s) were stable and durable for 7 h (Fig. 26e). Wang et al. fabricated robust SLIS by utilizing phase transformable peanut oil, and compared its stability with traditional SLIS.430 Phase transformable SLIS (PTSLIS) was synthesized by infusing peanut oil in porous PDMS substrates. Subsequently, in the freezing condition, the solid peanut oils in PTSLIS were well retained in porous PDMS substrates while liquid oils in SLIS were easily drained from the pores by capillary force from nucleation of icicle. In addition, phase transformable lubricants were capable of self-healing bulk damage. At a temperature of above 3 \u00b0C, liquid-phase lubricants could spontaneously flow to the damage regions to form a homogenous lubricant layer via surface-energy-driven-capillary forces. At freezing temperature, liquid-phase oil was converted into solid-phase oil, which possessed greater intermolecular force and was beneficial for self-repair of damaged areas.\nStoddard et al. studied the effect of surface chemistry on the durability of superhydrophobic surfaces and SLISs.431 Copper tubes were firstly roughened via chemical etching and electrodeposition methods, and then modified by six different functionalizing agents (including PFTDS, stearic acid, octylphosphonic acid, n-hexadecyl mercaptan, and DOW Sylgard-184) to obtain the superhydrophobic surfaces, after which five different lubricants (including Krytox 103 and 104, Dowsil 510 with viscosity of 50 and 100 cSt, Santolube OS-105) were infused to prepare the SLISs. Results showed that the superhydrophobic surfaces with different functionalizing agents performed well in cold water immersion (\u2264 20 \u00b0C), but only n-hexadecyl mercaptan coating and curing-based Sylgard-184 exhibited significant durability in heated water immersion (70 \u00b0C) and under water jet impingement. In addition, a lubricant with high surface tension (Santolube OS-105, 36.1 mN m\u22121 at 23 \u00b0C) imparted the SLIS with the best durability in heated water immersion since the strong intermolecular interactions reduced the spreading of the lubricant in water, while high dynamic viscosity lubricant (Krytox 104, 243.5 mPa\u00b7s at 25 \u00b0C) showed the best durability towards water jet impingement due to its lowest susceptibility to shear degradation."

            "text": "It is well-known that the geometries of rough structures are crucial for liquid repellence of a solid surface, as well as their own mechanical strength which mainly influenced the mechanical durability of the surface, but the requirements for liquid repellence and mechanical durability are conflicting from both theoretical and experimental perspectives.45,47,432-434 Taking micro/nano pillars or needles featured superhydrophobic surface as an example, a high height-to-pitch aspect ratio of the features is required to decrease the liquid-solid contact area (i.e., f1 in eqn (6)) so as to increase superhydrophobicity, but the low contact area also results in high contact pressure and makes the pillars or needles fragile towards external force action, which thereby lowers the mechanical durability of the liquid repellence.434 Therefore, the geometries of micro/nano structures have to be optimized in order to develop robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces.\nCompared with pillar-like open-cell structures, those closed-cell micro geometries (such as brick or honeycomb structures) are demonstrated to be more effective in constructing robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces.435 For example, Mishchenko et al. showed that a superhydrophobic surface with closed-cell brick structures (features of 15 \u00d7 39 \u03bcm2) could effectively repel water droplets impacting from a height of 10 cm, while that with posts array architectures failed at half that feature spacing.435 They also demonstrated that the CA of a water droplet on superhydrophobic surface with closed-cell structures changed little even at pressures up to 40\u201360 atm, which implied that such surface was durable towards dynamic impacting by droplets with speed of 90\u2013135 m/s. Park et al. reported a mechanically durable superhydrophobic surface with dual hole patterned hexagonal arrays (Fig. 27a).436 A conventional photolithography process was employed to prepare a nickel stamp to imprint superhydrophobic pattern on the composite of carbon nanotubes and PDMS. By moving a rubber tip horizontally under applied normal loading of 1.5 N on the superhydrophobic surfaces with micro pillars or dual hole patterns, it could be observed that the pillars were severely damaged after 100 cycles wear test causing degradation of hydrophobicity, while the dual hole arrays maintained their morphology and hydrophobicity after even 600 cycles wear demonstrating their mechanical durability (Fig. 27b).\nTo improve the mechanical durability of superhydrophobic surface with nanocones, Kim et al. proposed a self-reinforcing egg-crate-like inverted-nanocones (i.e., nanoholes).437 When 4 N external force was applied on the two nano structures with pitch of 200 nm and aspect ratio of 4, the stress of the nanocone was clearly concentrated at the conical tip, and the calculated shear/normal stresses were 50.4/44.8MPa, while that of the inverted-nanocone evenly distributed over the entire top surface area, and the maximum shear/normal stresses were only 1.34/1.23 MPa (Fig. 27c). The enhanced mechanical stability of the interconnected inverted-nanocone arrays was attributed to the improved redistribution of the shear/normal mechanical loading compared with the nanocone arrays.\nWang et al. further studied the mechanical stability of interconnected microstructures (Fig. 28a) by changing the angle between the sidewall and the substrate of the microstructures (\u03b1sidewall) while keeping the top contact area constant.47 As shown in Fig. 28b, multipurpose finite-element analysis results showed that the third principal stress of the features decreased markedly as \u03b1sidewall increased, demonstrating that increasing \u03b1sidewall was an effective way to improve the mechanical stability of the interconnected\nmicrostructures. Conversely, the before1f increased to after 1f after mechanical abrasion fracture reduced\nthe height in half, and the increment ( after before\n1 1 1f f f = \u2212 ) increased with \u03b1sidewall, which indicated larger\nliquid adhesion force and thereby poorer water repellence. Consequently, the \u03b1sidewall was optimized to be around 120\u00b0 in which both superhydrophobicity and mechanical stability could be balanced and guaranteed. Moreover, the authors compared the mechanical stability of interconnected inverted-pyramidal (\u03b1sidewall = 125 \u00b0), pillar and pyramidal microstructures with the same f1 of 3% (Fig. 28c). The breakpoints in the displacement-load curves of microindentation testing indicated the fracture of the microstructures (points I, II, and III in Fig. 28d), and it was found that the inverted-pyramidal structures could resist the highest loading and thereby showed the best mechanical stability. Based on the interconnected inverted-pyramidal with optimized geometries, the authors designed robust and durable armoured superhydrophobic surfaces, which will be discussed in Section 4.2.4.\nRe-entrant geometry was introduced to improve the mechanical durability of liquid-repellent surfaces against shear loading by scratching.438 By mimicking the omniphobic skin of springtails, Hensel et al. prepared omniphobic polymer membranes with comb-like patterned cavities with re-entrant structures via reverse imprint lithography (Fig. 29a and b). Wear tests of the polymer membranes with the re-entrant structures in comparison to that with pillar structures were conducted by an oscillating steel ball in combination with a load. Results showed that membranes with re-entrant structures deformed plastically during loading dissipation and delaminated from the substrates, while the pillars broke at their bottom where the highest bending stress occurred (Fig. 29c). The re-entrant geometry provided a continuous and self-supporting surface that could resist normal loads of 200 to 500 mN depending on the comb wall width, while the pillar structures withstood much lower normal loads (1 to 75 mN) (Fig. 29d). Therefore, re-entrant structures featured surfaces showed significantly higher mechanical durability than pillar arrays covered ones. Furthermore, Hu et al. designed a flexible superhydrophobic surface comprising mesoscale heads and microscale spring sets (Fig. 29e) that was similar to the mushroom-like re-entrant geometry on springtail cuticles. Compared with mushroom-like units with rigid supports, the units with spring-like flexible supports showed mechanical durability against ubiquitous normal and shear compress (Fig. 29f),\nas well as tribological friction.50 Moreover, these micro structures with re-entrant geometries can also be used to improve the thermodynamic durability of liquid-repellent surfaces, which will be discussed in section 4.2.2.1."

            "text": "As discussed above, superhydrophobicity and superoleophobicity in air relies on the retained air pockets, superoleophobicity underwater originates from the locked water layer, and the liquid repellence of SLIS depends on the infused lubricant layer. Consequently, the stability of these micro/nano structure enabled \u201ccushion\u201d determines the thermodynamic durability of the liquid-repellent surfaces, which further influences the chemical durability of these surfaces in terms of immersing in corrosive liquids or exposing to corrosive vapors. Closed-cell micro geometries show much higher pressure stability than open-cell structures due to the confinement of the air underneath the droplet in closed wells, rendering them capable of stabilizing the \u201ccushion\u201d and durable towards droplet impacting.435 Besides, re-entrant structures and nano structures have been extensively designed to stabilize the \u201ccushion\u201d.\n4.2.2.1 Re-entrant structures. Compared with traditional typical pillar microstructures, re-entrant structures have proved to be capable of increasing the breakthrough pressure of the liquid (Pbreak, namely\nthe hydrostatic pressure value at which the \u201ccushion\u201d collapses upon immersion in the liquid), thereby stabilizing the air cushion to improve the durability of the super liquid-repellent surfaces. The springtail skin inspired polymer membranes with re-entrant structures (Fig. 29a and b) were shown to obviously increase the stability of the air cushion upon long-term immersion in water or hexadecane (Fig. 30a).438 It could be found that the opening diameter of the cavity, 2a, had significant influence on the Pbreak (Fig. 30b). For 2a < 1 \u03bcm, the Pbreak significantly increased up to ~ 350 kPa for water and ~ 60 kPa for hexadecane. Shi et al. fabricated re-entrant micropillar arrays by using a top-restricted self-growth strategy, through which the structural parameters of the re-entrant micropillar array (center-to-center distance P, microdisk diameter D, and height H) could be easily adjusted.214 By studying the dynamic deformation of ethylene glycol droplet deposited on the surface by applying external vertical vibration, they found that the re-entrant micropillar with P of 650 \u03bcm, D of 500 \u03bcm and H of ~ 700 \u03bcm showed better dynamic pressure resistance. Recently, Hu et al. designed new super liquid-repellent surfaces with re-entrant heads atop spring-like flexible supports by 3D direct laser writing lithography (Fig. 30c), and trampoline-inspired extra horizontal springs to link adjacent mushroom-like heads was further proposed to resolve the structural instability owing to stress concentration and large aspect ratio (Fig. 30d).215 In contrast to the re-entrant heads with rigid supports, the spring-like flexible supports were proved to contribute a 15.60% improvement of droplet impalement resistance, and even reached a 50.98% enhancement with the aid of trampoline-inspired horizontal springs.\nAlthough singly re-entrant structures increased the breakthrough pressure of liquids, and thus improved the stability of the air cushion, it was subsequently demonstrated that doubly or triply re-entrant structures could further minimize the break-in force by the liquid pressure and maximize the surface tension force that favored the beading up of the liquid even without the requirement of surface fluorination.188,191 For example, Domingues et al. studied the stability of entrapped air on coating-free Si/SiO2 surfaces with different micro-textures, including simple cavity, re-entrant cavity and doubly re-entrant cavity (Fig. 31a), under wetting liquids.424 Results showed that the breakthrough pressures of intruding water on simple cavities were 0 kPa, while those on (doubly) re-entrant cavities were typically larger than 100 kPa. In addition, while the air entrapped in circular or non-circular simple cavities immersed in hexadecane was lost within 0.2 s, the air entrapped in various (doubly) re-entrant cavities showed much better stability, and the circular (doubly) re-entrant cavities even stabilized the intruding menisci such that the trapped air remained almost intact even after 27 days (Fig. 31b), a duration that was over 7 orders of magnitude longer than for the simple cavity. Recently, it was demonstrated that a surface with nanoscale doubly re-entrant structures could repel impacting water droplets with a Weber number as high as 103 at room temperature due to its extremely high breakthrough pressure.305 Sun et al. designed robust super liquid-repellent surfaces by depositing hydrophobized silica nanoparticles onto multilayered doubly re-entrant micro structures (Fig. 31c) that could generate stepwise wetting resistance.439 Three layers of doubly re-entrant posts with increasing diameter from top to bottom provided multiple energy barriers for intrusive liquid due to stepwise sagging of the liquid-air interface. The maximum Laplace pressure difference and theoretical Pbreak across the liquid-air interface at the third layer (respectively referred as Pmax3 and Pbreak3 in Fig. 31d and e) reached up to ~ 1.6 kPa and ~ 2.3 kPa, respectively, which were approximately 2\u20133 times of those of single layered doubly re-entrant posts. This endowed the engineered surfaces with durable super liquid repellence against droplet evaporation, dynamic impact by ethylene glycol droplets with Weber number of 35, and random vibration underwater.\nFurthermore, Liu et al. prepared triply re-entrant microstructures by adding a small overhang at the bottom of the inner vertical overhang doubly re-entrant microstructure via two-photon polymerization-based 3D printing (Fig. 32a\u2013c), and demonstrated that the triply re-entrant structures showed higher Pbreak in comparisons with traditional microscale pillars, singly re-entrant structures, and doubly re-entrant structures (Fig. 32d).191 The printed surface possessed super-repellence to water and various organic liquids with surface tensions of 12.0\u201327.1 mN m\u22121, which could even be retained after oxygen plasma treatment.\n4.2.2.2 Nano structures. Compared with microscale structures, nano structures can enhance the durability of superhydrophobic and superoleophobic surfaces in air by generating larger anti-wetting pressure. By introducing effective water hammer pressure of impinging droplets on superhydrophobic surfaces, Deng et al. demonstrated that sub-100-nm textures could generate large enough anti-wetting pressure for impinging droplets with high speed, which favored the durability of the air cushion under liquid impacting and thereby improved the thermodynamic durability of super liquid-repellent surfaces.322\nShieh et al. further revealed that a nanograss (diameter of ~ 20 nm, length of ~ 200 nm) or nanopillar (diameter of 100 nm, height of 1 \u03bcm, and pillar-to-pillar distance of 200 nm to 50 \u03bcm) structure alone did not result in an improvement, while the nanograss decorated nanopillar structures remarkably improved the robustness of the superhydrophobic surface towards liquid impingment.440 Recently, it was also verified that a nanostructurally-densified superamphiphobic coating possessed enhanced durability during long-term immersion in mixed synthetic and vegetable oils.441\nIt is well-known that the air cushion trapped in microscale structures can be easily penetrated by vapor, resulting in the loss of superhydrophobicity during condensation. Superhydrophobic surfaces with dense nanocone arrays were demonstrated to be much superior in antifogging,442 which highlighted the role of nanoscale textures in stabilizing the air cushion towards vapor condensation. Meanwhile, condensate micro droplets on liquid-repellent surfaces with nanostructures could be self-propelled since the coalescence-released excess surface energy was much larger than the interface adhesion-induced energy dissipation.51,183,443-448 For example, as shown in Fig. 33, Wang et al. demonstrated that condensate micro droplets on a superhydrophobic surface with closely packed aligned ZnO nanoneedles could be self-removed by mutual coalescence-induced jumping, and the surface thereby maintained long-term water repellence in extreme vapor conditions.449 They also showed that the geometric parameters of the nanoneedles (i.e., tip size, height, and interspace) influenced the vapor condensation and micro droplet departure: decreasing the interspace could increase nucleation density of condensate droplets and reduce their departure diameters. Reducing the tip size and height favored the reduction of the departure diameters of the droplets, all of which were beneficial to improve the durability of superhydrophobic surface towards condensation.\nBesides the simple one-tier nanoscale structures, the role of nanostructures in designing super liquid-repellent surfaces with hierarchical structures has also been demonstrated. McCarthy et al. experimentally demonstrated that the micro and nanoscale structures of hierarchical superhydrophobic surfaces played distinct, but complementary, roles in endowing the surface with durable water repellence under droplet impacting.450 The nanostructures provided a large anti-wetting capillary pressure, while the micro features hindered the development and propagation of pressures due to liquid compression. Verho et al. studied pressure-induced wetting states transition of superhydrophobic surfaces with one-tier (i.e., microscale) and two-tier (i.e., micro-nano hierarchical) topographies.451 Results showed that positive Laplace pressure caused an irreversible transition from the Cassie to the Wenzel wetting state for the superhydrophobic surface with single-level topography (Fig. 34a). However, the nanostructures on the surface with hierarchical textures effectively suppressed the transition to the Wenzel state and instead to a so-called nano-Cassie state due to the trapped air in the nanostructures, demonstrating reversible and durable Cassie state superhydrophobicity (Fig. 34b). Similar work was reported by Li et al., who demonstrated a so-called monostable superhydrophobic surface with hierarchical textures, where the transitions from the Cassie state to the Wenzel state became spontaneously reversible.301 By considering nanotextures enhanced durability, Mouterde et al. proposed structural recipes of superhydrophobic surface for repelling hot water: rough features with small radial size (e.g., radius of top, ~ 100 nm) and relatively large axial dimensions (e.g., height of ~ 10 \u03bcm).312 The nanometric top limited the size of vapor-condensation-induced water bridges and thus miniaturized the droplet sticking, while the tall features dynamically prevented the formation of water bridges between the hot droplets and the solid surface during contact.\nFor underwater superolephobic surface and SLIS, nano structures stabilize the water or lubricant layer via superior capillary forces.249,342 Kim et al. discussed the performance of retaining oils on four types of lubricant-infused substrates, such as flat, microtextured, nanostructured and hierarchically structured substrates, and demonstrated that the substrates with nanotextures possessed the best ability of oil retention (Fig. 35a).261 Microtextured, nanostructured and hierarchically structured roughness on aluminum substrates were synthesized after sandblasting, boehmite and both of sandblasting and boehmite, respectively. For flat substrates, it was difficult to hold lubricants due to a lack of capillary force when exposed to practical conditions (Fig. 35a, i). On microtextured substrates, lubricants easily leaked from valleys between the microscale structures when the length scale of the microtextured features was larger than the capillary length of the lubricant (Fig. 35a, ii). In terms of hierarchically structured substrates consisting of nanostructured and micro-structured textures, nanoscale roughness provided a large capillary force to retain lubricants, but there was still the loss of lubricant from valleys of microscale topographies (Fig. 35a, iii). Lubricants were stabilized in SLIS with nanostructures when the thickness of the lubricant layer matched well with the height of nanostructured textures (Fig. 35a, iv). Therefore, SLISs with nanostructured roughness were demonstrated to possess the best performance in oil retention compared with the other three kinds of substrates under high shear conditions. Wang et al. fabricated robust tungsten oxide (WO3)-based slippery surfaces, and proved that oil retention and durability of the obtained SLIS had a close relationship with the diameter and specific surface area of the WO3 nanostructures.452 WO3 nanoparticles with smaller diameter and larger specific surface area were\nfavorable for the immobilization of the lubricants, which improved the long-term stability of WO3-based SLIS under high shear force and flowing water impact. Adera et al. studied the lubricant depletion from horizontal copper tube with SLIS, and found that the closely spaced nano-florets helped to immobilize and retain the lubrication film via capillarity, which made nearly half of the lubrication film to remain on the surface after 10 h of continuous steam condensation at ambient pressure, 23 \u00b0C, and 60% relative humidity.342\nVogel et al. designed well-ordered honeycomb wall nanostructures in which lubricants could be strongly locked and flow freely, even when exposed to strong shear forces or long-term storage.357 The SLISs were prepared as follows: a homogeneous and interconnected porous layer was synthesized by using a silica precursor solution to backfill colloidal monolayer on a glass substrate and then the colloids\nwere removed at high temperature, which was followed by infusing the porous intermediate with fluorinated oil. When the SLIS was damaged partly (damaged region was 33%), it retained outstanding octane repellent property with a SA of < 5\u00b0 under spin-coating at 10000 r.p.m. This could be attributed to the interconnected nanoscale pore structures that favored the formation of intact surface via re-filling of the lubricant. The as-prepared SLIS retained remarkable octane repellency with SAs of below 10\u00b0 after being stored more than 9 months without replenishment of the lubricants. In addition, SEM images shown in Fig. 35b demonstrated complete structural integrity of the closed-cell architectures after various mechanical testing including tape peeling, touching, and wiping, while the open-cell samples were completely destroyed by any of the testing (Fig. 35b, insets). These results demonstrated the excellent robustness and durability of the SLIS with closed-cell nanopores array, the coated glass slides showed efficient repellency to dyed octane droplet after mechanical wiping, scratching with a razor blade and sandpaper (Fig. 35c). Furthermore, Laney et al. reported delayed lubricant depletion of SLIS with nanotube texture in comparison to nanohole and nanopillar textures (Fig. 35d).453 The authors fabricated an array of silicon nanotubes and equivalent arrays of nanoholes and nanopillars (pitch, 560 nm; height, 2 \u03bcm), and obtained the corresponding SLISs after surface hydrophobic treatment and subsequent infusion with lubricant Krytox 1525. Shear tolerance test revealed that all nanostructures were able to retain the lubricant via capillary action up to 10000 rpm, but harsh water droplet shedding test showed 2-fold and 1.5-fold enhancements of lubricant retention in nanotubes in comparison to nanopillars and nanoholes, respectively, demonstrating a prolonged lifetime of the SLIS with nanotube textures.\nRecently, Zhang et al. proposed a new mechanism of nanostructures enhanced lubricant retention for SLIS during its contact with water.454 By using surface-sensitive sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy, the authors characterised the water-lubricant interface of a water droplet depositing on a lubricant-infused nanostructured surface and the same lubricant layer without the underlying nanostructures. The results demonstrated that due to the strong interaction between the infused lubricant and underlying nanostructures, water droplets deposited on nanostructured SLIS preferred a molecular orientation that was predominantly parallel to the water-lubricant interface (Fig. 35e), which weakened the hydrogen bonding interactions between the water droplets and lubricant, imparting the SLIS with excellent water repellence and reduction of lubricant depletion during contact with water."

            "text": "Many of the durability problems of liquid-repellent surfaces arise from the fact that the outermost layer cannot survive through mechanical and chemical destruction, and the thin functional layer may be easily removed or destroyed so as to lose their liquid repellence. If the rough structures and chemistries are self-similar throughout the coating/matrix, the freshly exposed area after damage will be similar in wettability and functionality with the top or undamaged layer, which thereby can be used to design robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces.455-459 Based on this strategy, liquid-repellent coatings with self-similar structures can be used to render the underlying substrates robust and durable liquid repellence until the coatings are completely damaged or removed. For example, Deng et al. deposited a porous layer\nof candle soot on a glass slide and then coated the soot with a silica shell, after which the coating was calcinated and subsequently silanized to prepare a superamphiphobic surface (Fig. 36a, b).217 The surface retained its superamphiphobicity after 5 min of falling sand abrasion from a height of 25 cm (the corresponding impacting velocity was ~ 2 m s\u22121). The silica shells were not sufficiently robust to completely resist the sand abrasion, and an eroded cave was observed at the impacted area (Fig. 36c). However, the exposed area showed similar sub-micrometer structure with the original surface (Fig. 36d), which enabled the impacted surface to be oil-repellent until the coating\u2019s thickness was reduced to < 2 \u03bcm by extended sand abrasion. The proposed candle soot-templated porous silica shell with self-similar micro/nano structures was followed in many subsequent works that focused on the fabrication of various robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces.47,223,460-464 Additionally, fluorosurfactant-coated silica aerogels have also been demonstrated to create self-similar nanoporous frameworks with re-entrant surface topography that rendered the surface mechanically robust superamphiphobicity.465 Kong et al. prepared a robust and durable sprayable superhydrophobic coating by designing polydivinylbenzene nanotubes interweaved fluorine-containing SiO2 nanoparticles. 197 The authors firstly prepared post cross-linked polydivinylbenzene nanotubes with abundant mesopores via a Friedel-Crafts reaction, and then mixed the nanotubes with industrial paraffin wax, ethyl \u03b1-cyanoacrylate, and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltrimethoxysilane functionalized SiO2 nanoparticles, which were finally sprayed on wood substrates to create superhydrophobic surfaces. The combination of polydivinylbenzene nanotubes and fluorinated SiO2 nanoparticles formed self-similar hierarchical structures, which enabled the superhydrophobic surface to tolerate various chemical and mechanical durability testing, such as immersion in corrosive solutions for 24 h, UV illumination for 70 h, ultrasonic processing for 1 h, finger rubbing, circular abrasion (500 g loading, 1000 cycles), and scratching by box cutter.\nBesides these coated liquid-repellent materials on substrates, free-standing 3D blocks with self-similar structures between the exterior surface and internal space have also been widely developed to create liquid-repellent monoliths.46,458 Li et al. reported a robust superhydrophobic PDMS/SiO2 thick film prepared by thiol-ene photopolymerization of PDMS/hydrophobic SiO2/cyclohexane suspension and subsequent solvent evaporation (Fig. 36e).351 The formed self-similar hierarchical structures (Fig. 36f) enabled the film to retain its superhydrophobicity even after 500 cycles of abrasion by sandpaper, as well as \u201cplasma + sanding\u201d treatment. Based on a simple 1,4-conjugated addition reaction, Chen et al. prepared superhydrophobic nanocomplexes bulk by a facile gelation process involving dipentaerythritol penta-/hexa-acrylate (5Acl) and branched polyethylenimine ethylenediamine (BPEI) (Fig. 36g), and subsequent modification with octadecylamine.466 Due to its self-similar microstructures (Fig. 36h), the bulk material retained the superhydrophobicity after cutting (Fig. 36i), water jet impacting, rubbing, and sandpaper abrasion. Recently, 1,4-conjugated addition reaction between selected small molecules, i.e., [3-(2-aminoethylamino)propyl]trimethoxysilane and octadecyl acrylate, in the presence and absence of crosslinker molecules [pentaerythritol triacrylate (3-Acl) or 5-Acl], were reported to develop \u201ctolerant and hard\u201d superhydrophobic coatings on polyurethane fabric and melamine formaldehyde sponge.467 The\nself-similar micro/nano structures enabled the resultant superhydrophobicity to be highly robust and durable towards sandpaper abrasion for 30 m, various chemical invasion (including acid, alkali, salt, and organic solvents) for 30 days, and washing test for 250 cycles. Recently, Dong et al. developed a method to print superhydrophobic objects with bulk nanostructures by combining 3D printing with photopolymerization-induced phase separation based on a specific printing ink composed of hydrophobic (meth)acrylate monomers and porogen solvents.52 Owing to the self-similar bulk nanostructures, the printed object showed superhydrophobicity both on the surface and on the cross-section. As shown in Fig. 36j, when the bulk material was abraded on sandpaper under a pressure of 10 kPa for 10 cm per cycle, it remained superhydrophobic even after 40 abrasion cycles owing to the exposed surface underneath after abrasion was structurally similar to the original surface.\npermission from ref. 351.

            "text": "Rough topographies are almost indispensable to achieve liquid-repellent surfaces. As discussed above, nanoscale structures can enhance the liquid repellence via special capillarity, but these structures are intrinsically extremely fragile towards mechanical force and can be easily destroyed even by rather low mechanical stress. By contrast, microscale features possess much higher resistance to external forces induced destruction. However, owing to the considerable contact line pinning at the edges of the microstructures, liquid-repellent surfaces with microstructures alone always exhibit large CAH and low liquid mobility. Therefore, hierarchical structures, combination of micro and nano structures, have been widely employed to improve the mechanical durability of liquid-repellent surfaces.45,53,405,468 When hierarchical structures are exposed to mechanical stress, the microstructures bear much of the loading, which thereby protects the fragile nanostructures from being damaged. For example, Zimmermann et al. reported a gas phase coating procedure to deposit a polymethylsilsesquioxane nanofilaments layer on various textile fabrics, by which robust superhydrophobicity was created.156 As illustrated in Fig. 37a, a superhydrophobic poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fabric retained its water repellent property after 1450 cycles skin-simulating abrasion under a contact pressure of 7.8 kPa, and it could be easily seen that the 3D microstructure of the fabric protected the majority of the nanofilaments from being damaged during abrasion (Fig. 37b). Xiu et al. compared the mechanical durability of several superhydrophobic surfaces, including hierarchically structured silicon, nanostructured polyurethane, PTFE, silica and silicon.53 After abrasion by polyester/cellulose Technicloth II wipes (pressure of 3.45 KPa and abrasion length of 25 cm), the superhydrophobic silicon surface with two-scale micro- and nano-structures showed robust water repellence with nearly constant water CA (> 165\u00b0) and small CAH increase (from 2\u00b0 to 13.6\u00b0), while all other surfaces lost their superhydrophobicity (water CA < 140\u00b0 and CAH > 60\u00b0). Surface morphology characterisation showed that the nanostructures alone were easy to damage, as well as those on the tops of the micro pyramids, but the nanostructures close to the base of the micro pyramids were well protected and retained, which largely improved the robustness of water repellence towards mechanical abrasion. Verho et al. proposed a model to explain the hierarchical architectures induced mechanical durability of super liquid repellence, as shown in Fig. 37c.286 If the surface was composed of one-tier structures (either micro or nano scale), abrasion caused the structures to wear off, leading to a rupture of the Cassie-Baxter wetting state. By contrast, if nanostructures were decorated on microstructures, most of the nanoscale architectures could be protected by the microstructures during abrasion, except the ones on the top of the microstructures that were directly exposed to abrasion, which favored the stable Cassie-Baxter wetting state.\nLin et al. designed a robust superhydrophobic carbon nanofiber-polydimethylsiloxane (CNFs-PDMS) network inlay-gated stainless-steel mesh (SSM).469 They deposited CNFs into the pores of SSM to form network fillers via vacuum filtration, which became superhydrophobic after being coated with PDMS layer (Fig. 38a). The wires of the mesh acted as protective supports to the embedded CNFs-PDMS composites during abrasion (Fig. 38b and c), which enabled the mesh to retain its superhydrophobicity after 15 cycles abrasion by sandpaper under pressure of ~ 1.7 kPa and abrasion length of 5 cm per cycle. Based on this, they proposed a concept of discrete or partial superhydrophobicity, indicating that although the protective structures were partially damaged and lost the water repellence due to physical abrasion, the protected areas were well preserved and thereby retained the overall superhydrophobicity of the surface.\nRecently, Qing et al. proposed a microskeleton-nanofiller composite to form an excellent mechanically robust superhydrophobic film against abrasion and impact.354 They filled phosphorizing liquid roughened porous iron with inorganic/organic medium composed of fluorinated epoxy resin, hydrophobic SiO2 nanoparticles and \u03b3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, and the resultant composite film showed superhydrophobicity (Fig. 38d). Due to the protectiveness of the microskeleton, the nanofiller could be well retained during knife scratch, cyclic tape peeling, and continuous sandpaper/Taber abrasion (Fig. 38e and f), thereby reserving superhydrophobicity before complete wearing of the film. Additionally, the tight composite filler protected the microskeleton from being collapsed during bearing ball impacting (Fig. 38g), which enabled robustness to heavy impact at least up to a kinetic energy of ~ 40.2 J.\nWang et al. further demonstrated that when the liquid-solid contact fraction (f1) is small enough, the surface could still repel water even if the contact areas were altered from hydrophobic to hydrophilic during mechanical abrasion (Fig. 39a).47 Based on this, they reported a mechanically durable water-repellent surface with skillfully designed \u201carmoured\u201d micro/nano structures. They deposited nanoparticles into interconnected microstructures that contained crater-like \u201cpockets\u201d, and the nanostructures were used to provide water repellency while the microstructures were designed to protect the mechanically fragile nanoparticles (Fig. 39b). Benefiting from the protection of mechanically robust microstructure armour, the housed superhydrophobic nanoparticles could be well preserved during abrasion, which endowed the surface to be water-repellent before f1 increased to a critical value upon abrasion (Fig. 39c). For example, they fabricated inverted-pyramidal microstructures on silicon substrates with different open cavity widths L and liquid-solid contact fractions f1, and then filled the microstructure\nframeworks with soot-templated silica nanostructures, finally yielding water-repellent surfaces after fluoridation. Repeated scraping by steel blade gradually removed materials (both the fluorosilane layer and the matrix) from the top of the microstructures (Fig. 39d), which changed the local wetting properties of the surface from hydrophobic (\u03b8Y = 115\u00b0) to hydrophilic (\u03b8Y = 45\u00b0) and increased the liquid-solid contact fraction f1, but the surfaces retained their super water repellence after abrasion if f1 was lower than 8% (Fig. 39e and f). Linear abrasion testing (vertical pressure of 12 MPa and abrasion speed of 50 mm s\u22121) of the armoured superhydrophobic surfaces showed that more than 1000 cycles of abrasion could be tolerated, which was 10 times higher than that of conventional superhydrophobic surfaces (Fig. 39g). The remarkable mechanical durability of the armoured water-repellent surfaces was also confirmed by other testing, including scratching, tape-peeling, Taber abrasion and high-speed water jet impacting."

            "text": "Compared with roughening the substrates and tailoring the surface free energy, coating is regarded as a\nuniversal, easy-to-commercialize, and substrate-independent solution to construct liquid-repellent surfaces. Therefore, strengthening the bonding between the coating and the substrate becomes significant to improve their robustness and durability. Different from the weak physical adsorption induced by van der Waals forces, chemical bonding via covalent bonds, cross-linking, adhesive layer assistance, etc. are much stronger to tolerate mechanical and chemical damage, which are thereby widely developed to enhance the bonding strength at the coating-substrate interface of liquid-repellent surfaces.45,344,405 4.3.1 Covalent bonding In general, covalent bonds can be generated between substrates and coatings via reactions of chemical reactive groups. Surfaces with abundant hydroxyl groups (e.g., cellulose-based fabrics, filter paper, etc.) can directly react with silanol, epoxide groups, etc. to form covalent bonds. Deng et al. soaked a cotton fabric into a methanol solution containing 1H,1H,2H,2H-nonafluorohexyl-1-acrylate monomer and then initiated graft polymerization under \u03b3-rays irradiation in a nitrogen atmosphere, which resulted in covalent connection of fluorinated compounds onto the cotton fiber at the molecular level.377 When the degree of grafting was higher than 10%, the obtained fabric showed stable superhydrophobicity. Due to the strong binding between the cotton fiber and the fluorinated groups, the grafted fabric retained its superhydrophobicity after 50 accelerated laundering cycles, which was equivalent to 250 commercial or domestic launderings. Zou et al. prepared a highly durable and robust superhydrophobic cotton fabrics based on covalent bonding by using diblock copolymers consisting of poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA) and poly(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate) (PTFEMA) blocks.290 The block copolymers self-assembled into micellar aggregates to form nanoscale roughness, and the PTFEMA block lowered the surface free energy, while the PGMA block was covalently bonded to the surfaces of cotton fibers through a ring-opening reaction between the epoxy groups of the PGMA chains and the hydroxyl groups of the cotton fiber, and the self-crosslinking of the epoxy groups from PGMA chains. The covalently bonded PTFEMA chains favored the robustness and durability of the superhydrophobic fabrics towards various testing, including sandpaper abrasion, laundering, ultrasonication and boiling in tetrahydrofuran or trifluorotoluene, soaking in organic solvents and acidic/basic aqueous solutions, and exposure to UV irradiation. Fang et al. modified fabric with mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane to incorporate thiol groups, which was then used to anchor methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane modified SiO2@Fe3O4 (MPS-SiO2@Fe3O4) nanoparticles via UV-assisted thiol-ene click chemistry (Fig. 40a). 470 The obtained superhydrophobic fabric showed excellent robustness against tape-peeling, sandpaper abrasion, and corrosive solutions, which were attributed to the strong interactions between the MPS-SiO2@Fe3O4 nanoparticles and fabric by thiol-ene click reaction-induced covalent bonding.\nFor those surfaces with insufficient reactive groups (e.g., glass), pre-treatments by UV, ozone, plasma, or chemical solutions are required. For example, Zhang et al. reported a method to prepare robust superhydrophobic coatings via stoichiometric silanization (Fig. 40b\u2013d).414 The authors mixed pure octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) with water by vortex and sonication, which was then incubated for 2 h under ambient conditions before being diluted with hexane. The solution could be used to treat various substrates directly to obtain superhydrophobic surfaces, such as cotton fabric, filter paper, and PET, but pretreatment by UV-ozone cleaner was required for glass slides (Fig. 40b). During the solution preparation procedure, stoichiometric silanization reaction between long-chain organosilanes and water occurred and created micro- and nano-scale hierarchical siloxane aggregates (Fig. 40c). Owing to the incomplete silanization reaction after 2 h, reactive sites (\u2212Si\u2212OH or \u2212Si\u2212Cl) still existed on the aggregated particles, which facilitated the formation of covalent bonding between these hierarchical particles and the substrates covered with \u2212OH groups during the coating treatment. The covalently bonded coating showed robust superhydrophobicity towards falling sand abrasion, water jetting, water splashing and tissue wiping, etc. (Fig. 40d). Additionally, the coating could tolerate abrasion by sandpaper under a pressure of 2.5 kPa and a distance of 50 cm, since only the top layer of the coating was partially\nremoved while the remaining micro/nano structures were similarly rough to retain the super water repellence.\nBesides the covalent bonding of liquid-repellent coatings as discussed above, the lubricant layer of SLIS can also be stabilized via covalent bonding to improve its durability and stability.266,275 For example, Chen et al. fabricated robust ionic liquid-infused slippery surfaces via enhancement of the interaction between substrate and lubricant using a covalent half-polymerization strategy.471 Anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) with homogeneous pore size (~ 200 nm) was utilized as the porous substrate, and ionic liquid (1-vinyl-3-hexylimidazolium bis(tri-fluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) was employed as the infusing lubricant. Silane couplers with alkene terminated groups were firstly anchored on the AAO surfaces with abundant hydroxyl groups via chemical bonding (Fig. 41a), and then the intermediates with alkene groups were chemically linked with vinyl groups of ionic liquid via alkene polymerization (Fig. 41b). In this case, both the porous nanostructures-induced capillarity and the covalent half-polymerization-enhanced interaction between the substrate and ionic liquid contributed greatly to the stabilization of the lubricant layer, which rendered the resulted SLIS with excellent underwater durability, high temperature stability, shear-resistance and corrosion-resistance. Liu et al. reported a liquid-repellent PDMS coating on silicon or glass slide prepared by spontaneous and fast polymerization of dichlorodimethylsilane under the assistance of water hydrolysis.273 The grafted liquid-like PDMS brushes enabled the surface to be slippery and droplets of a variety of liquids could slide off at the tilting angles below 5\u00b0. Due to the strong covalent attachment of the PDMS brushes to the substrates, the prepared slippery liquid-repellent surface showed outstanding durability against long-term sonication washing, tape peeling, scouring pad wiping, high temperature treatment, and water vapor exposure."

            "text": "In addition to directly forming covalent bonds, cross-linking has also been introduced to increase the bonding density, which can further improve the bonding strength between liquid-repellent coatings and substrates. Cross-linking reactions can be triggered by adding cross-linking agents/catalysts, exposing to UV/plasma, etc. For example, Ye et al. synthesized 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane functionalized hydrophobic SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) first, and then incorporated hexamethylene diisocyanate tripolymer (N3375) as a cross-linking agent into their mixture with hydroxyl acrylic resin, which was finally sprayed onto a glass slide and cured to prepare a superhydrophobic surface.418 Owing to the formed cross-linked network structure (Fig. 42a), the resultant superhydrophobic surface could retain its water repellence after 30 cycles of sandpaper abrasion and 240 h of immersion in acid solution (pH = 1). Li et al. reported a method to prepare robust superhydrophobic surface by rapid UV cross-linking of superhydrophobic PDMS/SiO2 coating onto a stretchable polyurethane acrylate (PUA) substrate. 472 As shown in Fig. 42b, pre-polymer of PUA was cured via UV irradiation to form stretchable matrix, while its surface remained uncured due to the oxygen inhibition when exposed to air during the photopolymerization. The uncured PUA surface provided abundant reactive sites for cross-linking of the sprayed superhydrophobic PDMS/SiO2 coating under UV irradiation. The formed covalent cross-linking greatly enhanced the interface adhesion between the coating and substrate, which obviously improved the mechanical durability of the resultant superhydrophobic surface towards sandpaper abrasion and stretching-releasing.\nChen et al. fabricated robust superhydrophobic cotton textile by a simple two-step dip-dry strategy.473 The authors firstly dipped cotton fabric into homogeneous mixture of spherical SiO2 particles with different diameters (100, 200 and 400 nm), and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) in ethanol for 10 min. After drying at room temperature, the fabric was immersed into the mixture of PDMS prepolymer and its curing agent (mass ratio of 10:1) and 3-isocyanatomethyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexyl isocyanate (IPDI) in n-hexane for 2 min, and then obtained the superhydrophobic cotton after curing at 120 \u00b0C for 2 h. The surfaces of the SiO2 particles and cotton fabric were rich in \u2212OH groups, enabling them to be easily cross-linked together via the assistance of the silane coupling agent. During the first dip-coating, the \u2212OH groups generated by the hydrolysis of the C2H5O\u2212 groups of APTES acted as the linkage point and the \u2212OH groups on the surface of SiO2 particles were firstly bonded to the \u2212OH groups of the silanol surface and then connected to the \u2212OH groups of the cotton surface. The \u2212OH groups dehydrated and condensed during high-temperature curing, making the SiO2 particles combine with the cotton textile closely. In the second dip-coating procedure, IPDI was used as the cross-linking agent and its \u2212NCO group was introduced into the condensation reactions with the \u2212OH groups. During the heating assisted curing, the \u2212NCO group reacted with the \u2212OH group to form \u2212NHCOO\u2212 group, enabling the formation of covalent bonds among the PDMS, the SiO2 particles and the cotton textile. The covalent bonds imparted the superhydrophobic surface with outstanding mechanical durability (130 sandpaper abrasion cycles and 40 washing cycles) and chemical durability (immersion in strong acid, alkali, ethanol, toluene, hexane, acetone and boiling water for 24 h)."

            "heading": "4.3.3 Adhesive layer assistance",
            "text": "Besides direct covalent bonding and cross-linking, an adhesive layer has also been widely employed to enhance the bonding strength between liquid-repellent coatings and substrates. The mechanisms of adhesive enhanced bonding are complicated, including intermolecular forces, chemical bonds, mechanical interlock, etc. Both commercial and lab-synthesized adhesives, such as epoxy resin,343,474 PDMS,363,475 and even glues and double-sided tapes,54,218 have been reported to bond the coatings to improve the robustness and durability of the liquid-repellent surfaces. Zhou et al. prepared a robust superamphiphobic coating on fabric by immobilizing nanoparticles in the coating layer with a binding agent (Fig. 43a).403 Two coating solutions, a nano particulate silica sol that was co-hydrolyzed from tetraethylorthosilicate and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane (PFDTS) in ethanol under alkaline condition, and a poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP)/dimethylformamide solution containing PFDTS, were applied in sequence onto the fabric by the dip-coating method. The PVDF-HFP not only lowered the surface energy of the coating, but also served as a binder to immobilize the SiO2 particles, hence rendering the superamphiphobic coating with impressive durability towards 600 cycles of standard machine laundry, 800 cycles of abrasion, 1 h of boiling water soaking, and 7 days of immersion in strong acid and base solutions. Recently, PVDF-HFP and polyethersulfone were used as adhesive layer to bond fluorinated palygorskite@SiO2 composite to create a robust superamphiphobic surface. 476 Wu et al. reported robust superhydrophobic surfaces that were prepared by forming Ag nanoparticles (NPs) coated\nwith the copolymer (polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-co-butylene)-block-polystyrene: SEBS) via Ag precursor reduction and synchronous nonsolvent induced phase separation (Fig. 43b).378 The SEBS significantly strengthened the interaction among individual Ag NPs and the bonding between Ag NPs and the substrate, thereby making the superhydrophobic surfaces robust against ultrasonic treatment, bending, and sandpaper abrasion. Later, SEBS was used to enhance the bonding between dimethyloctadecyl [3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl] ammonium chloride modified SiO2 nanoparticles and various flat substrates, which endowed the resultant superhydrophobic surfaces with outstanding robustness and durability to cyclic tape-peeling, falling sand impacting, sandpaper abrasion, scrubbing, concentrated acid/alkaline, high/low temperature and UV irradiation.477\nLu et al. first proposed to promote the mechanical durability of superhydrophobic coatings by commercial adhesive enhanced bonding between the coatings and substrates.54 A paint-like ethanolic suspension of perfluorosilane-coated TiO2 nanoparticles was prepared and then sprayed, dipped, or extruded onto both hard and soft materials (e.g., glass, steel, cotton wool, and filter paper) to create superhydrophobic surfaces (Fig. 44a, for example). The authors developed a method to enhance the bonding strength between the coatings and substrates by using commercial adhesives (e.g., double-sided tape, spray adhesive), from which the weak inherent robustness of the superhydrophobic coatings was significantly overcome. The \u201cpaint + adhesive + substrate\u201d strategy enabled the resultant superhydrophobic surfaces to retain their water repellency after finger wiping, knife scratching, and 40 abrasion cycles with sandpaper (Fig. 44b). Enlightened by this work, commercial adhesive or glue have been frequently used to construct robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces.295,478 For example, Chen et al. prepared mechanically robust superamphiphobic surfaces by bonding perfluorooctanoic acid modified\ncopper particles onto various substrates (e.g., glass, aluminum, rubber, scouring pad, filter paper and sponge) with double-sided tape or commercial spray adhesive.218 Intensive falling sand abrasion (150 g of sand impacted on the coating from the height up to 70 cm) had little influence on the superamphiphobicity of the as-prepared surfaces, and a coated rubber could even retain both water and oil repellency after 50 stretch/release cycles.\nBesides the above-mentioned organic adhesives, inorganic adhesives have also been employed to enhance the bonding strength between liquid-repellent coatings and substrates. For example, Liu et al. developed robust underwater superoleophobic surfaces by spraying a composite suspension of nanoparticles and aluminum phosphate (AP) binder.244 The spraying solution was prepared by mixing AP with nanoparticles in ethanol/water cosolvent. During heating-assisted curing process, the hydroxy groups of the AP binder favored condensation-polymerization reaction via intermolecular and intramolecular dehydration to form continuous network structures, and the hydrogen (or coordination) bonds between the functional groups of the AP binder and oxygen (or metal) atoms on the surfaces of the substrates created strong molecular attractive forces to increase the adhesion (Fig. 44c). This strategy was available for various nanoparticles (such as TiO2, SiO2, and Al2O3) and substrates (SSM, ceramic, and glass) to construct robust underwater oil-repellent surfaces. As shown in Fig. 44d, after 500 abrasion cycles by sandpaper, the underwater oil CAs of the TiO2-AP-treated SSM retained above 150\u00b0 and the mass loss of the TiO2-AP coating was only ~ 20%. Sun et al. prepared a superamphiphobic coating by spray-coating of the suspension containing PFDTS-modified SiO2 nanoparticles and AP. The coating showed remarkable mechanochemical robustness due to the adhesive layer enhanced bonding between the inks and substrate,\nand neighboring SiO2 particles. 479 Xue et al. bound polystyrene nanoparticles onto cotton fibers with AP and then coated them with PDMS layer, finally yielding superhydrophobic cotton fabrics.393 Due to the improved bonding strength between the fibers and nanoparticles, the prepared fabric surfaces showed excellent stability to acid, alkali, salt, organic solvents and UV exposure, and could tolerate 2000 cycles of abrasion by nylon fabric cloth under loading pressure of 45 kPa, or 35 cycles of intensive laundering.\nMussel-inspired adhesion that is mediated by 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine opens a new avenue for enhancing the bonding strength between coating and substrate,480 and has also been frequently applied to fabricate robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces.481 By taking advantages of the self-polymerization of dopamine and dehydration polymerization of aluminum orthophosphate (AOP) binder, Lin et al. reported a robust and durable superhydrophobic coating with reinforced composite interfaces.358 As depicted in Fig. 45a, they firstly coated polydopamine layer on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) under the assistance of tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane hydrochloride. The polydopamine provided active hydroxyl groups for the in situ grows of Mg(OH)2 on CNTs when Mg 2+ were introduced under alkaline conditions, and CNTs-polydopamine&MgO (CP&MgO) composite particles with improved interfacial compatibility were obtained after calcination at 500 \u00b0C for 2 h under nitrogen atmosphere. Finally, the CP&MgO suspension, AOP binder solution and PTFE emulsion were well-mixed and sprayed on various cleaned substrates and then cured at 380 \u00b0C for 20 min to yield superhydrophobic PTFE-CP&MgO-AOP coating. As shown in Fig. 45b, during the dehydration polymerization reaction between the CP&MgO particles and AOP binder, phosphate networks (CP&MgO-AOP) were formed through cross-linking and hydrogen bonding interactions, which not only enhanced the interfacial interaction among CP&MgO particles but also strengthened the interfacial binding force between the PTFE-CP&MgO coating and the substrates. Owing to the improved composite interfacial strength, the superhydrophobic PTFE-CP&MgO-AOP coating showed excellent mechanical durability, which could withstand more than 1.27 \u00d7 105 cycles Taber abrasion with a 1000 mesh friction wheel and a loading of 100 kPa, as well as knife-scratching, finger wiping, and tape peeling. Additionally, the AOP binder enabled reticular/coral-like composite structures and the chemical inert PTFE layer imparted the superhydrophobic surfaces with excellent chemical durability and long-term stability under water.\nApart from the consideration of adhesives themselves, optimizing the bonding between the adhesive layer and micro/nano particles has also been proposed in recent years to further improve the robustness of the liquid-repellent surfaces.349,474 For example, Wu et al. proposed an inverse infusion method to construct extremely robust superhydrophobic hierarchical structures by using hydrophobic epoxy resin and Al2O3 nanoparticles (Fig. 46a). 349 They drop-casted an uncured fluorinated epoxy layer first on the substrate and then sprayed a nanocomposite coating containing fluorinated epoxy and Al2O3 nanoparticles, after which the uncured epoxy inversely infused into the micro/nanostructure and constructed a tougher microstructure on the top as well as a continuous nanocomposite layer throughout the coating after curing. Compared with the coating without inversely infused epoxy (i.e., the drop-casted epoxy layer was fully cured before spraying the nanocomposite coating, as depicted in Fig. 46b), the inverse infusion processed hierarchical structures showed more robust superhydrophobicity, which could tolerate 600 cycles of tape peeling tests, 20 m sandpaper abrasion, 115 cycles of Taber abrasion, and 600 g of sand impact from a height of 110 cm. Zhao et al. proposed to improve the adhesive bonding and hierarchical textures of the spin-coated superhydrophobic coating by using hydrophobic/hydrophilic dual-sized SiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 46c).474 Hydrophilic SiO2 nanoparticles (200 nm) synthesized via St\u00f6ber method 482 and commercially available hydrophobic SiO2 nanoparticles (55 nm) functionalized with \u2212O\u2212Si\u2212(CH3)3 groups were mixed and coated on the substrate by epoxy resin bonding. They found that the combination of the hydrophobic SiO2 and hydrophilic SiO2 was essential in creating hierarchical structures, and the strong adhesion of hydrophilic SiO2 (bottom of the coating film) to the substrates and porous structures of hydrophobic SiO2 (top of the coating film) were crucial to form robust superhydrophobicity towards droplet impacting and tape peeling (Fig. 46d\u2013f)."

The interfacial surface energy difference between the plasma treated surface and the surrounding air would drive the covalently bonded hydrophobic POTS molecules underneath the treated area to migrate to the outer surface through rearrangement of polyelectrolyte chains, which enabled the coating to restore its superhydrophobicity after aging for only 4 h under a relative humidity of 40%. Later, Jin et al. reported robust superamphiphobic silica aerogels that could retain their liquid repellence after 100 mechanical abrasion cycles, which was attributed to the combined effect of the self-similar re-entrant topography of the silica aerogels and the self-healing of the fluorinated surfactant (Fig. 47b).465 Liu et al. reported a mechanical stimuli induced self-healing of chemically damaged superhydrophobicity.487 They prepared superhydrophobic textiles by coating polydopamine nanocapsules that were filled with hydrophobic agents such as octadecylamine and octadecanethiol. These trapped hydrophobic agents could be released under mechanical stimuli (e.g., stretching, compression, friction, and even mechanical washing), which favored the self-healing of the superhydrophobicity when it was damaged by plasma treatment (Fig. 47c).\nCompared with superhydrophobic and superoleophobic surfaces, SLISs are naturally self-healable due to the mobility of the infused lubricant.20 However, lubricants are easily depleted or removed under some conditions like continuous water flow impacting or evaporation, even if the surface structures of the SLIS are well-designed.275 In order to further improve the longevity and durability of SLIS, incorporating self-replenishable lubricant by using internal oil reservoirs could be a good choice.488 Once lubricant layers are damaged, oils can continuously migrate from internal oil reservoirs to refill the damaged regions, and thus the self-healing function of SLIS is realized. For example, Liu et al. prepared robust and self-replenishing slippery lubricant-infused porous network surface (SLIPNS) for anti-icing applications.56 The key structures of the SLIPNS were the microchannels and nanosheets, which worked as internal oil reservoirs and vessels, respectively. As a comparison, SLIS with only nanosheets was also synthesized. During multiple icing/de-icing cycles, it was found that more lubricant retained on the SLIPNS, which exhibited more stable performance than the SLIS. When oil depletion occurred on SLIS, only the interfacial lubricant film flowed into the damaged areas (Fig. 48a). By contrast, in terms of the SLIPNS, the lost oil could be supplemented by both top oil layer and interconnected microchannels (Fig. 48b). Similarly, owing to the self-healable lubricant layer, the water repellence of the SLIPNS retained almost unchanged after knife scratch, repeated icing/de-icing, and water flow impact. Yu et al. fabricated robust and self-healing SLIS by using modified hollow silica spheres as oil reservoirs via a spray-coating method.271 The modified mesoporous silica particles were synthesized after vinyl-terminated PDMS was grafted on the external and internal sulfhydryl-modified hollow spheres via a thiol-ene click reaction. Consequently, lubricants could be locked or stored in hollow silica spheres due to its hollow cavity. When the lubricant layer was damaged, a certain amount of silicon oil could directly migrate from the inner wall to the surface of the modified hollow sphere to repair the defects under heat treatment. Li et al. reported another self-healing SLIS with superior self-replenishable lubrication by combining microstructured SLIS and nanostructured SLIS together (Fig. 48c), in which the square PDMS microwell was used as a reservoir to store sufficient lubricant and the PTFE nanofilm was employed as a skin to stabilize the thin lubricant layer.489 Through the collaborative effect of capillary corner filament inside the microwell and wettability gradient between the microwell and the nanofilm, the lubricant stored in the microwells could be directionally and timely transported to replenish the nanofilm when the lubricant within the nanofilm was depleted. Therefore, compared with the square microwell SLIS or nanofilm SLIS alone, the combined SLIS possessed lower oil depletion and more stable water repellence towards long-term cooling, heating, and water droplets impinging, and thereby showing robust and durable liquid repellence. Additionally, they found that the corner structures of the square microwell were indispensable for complete oil self-replenishment from a single microwell to the upper nanofilm, while most oil would stay at the bottom of the circular microcavity (Fig. 48d), which lead to a much higher self-replenishing ratio of the lubricant in square microwell (> 95%) than that in circular microcavity (~ 50%)."

When the surface textures of liquid-repellent surfaces are distorted but not removed from the underlying substrates by external force, strategies like using elastic materials (e.g., PDMS) and shape memory polymers (SMPs) can be used to recover the textures, and thereby restores the liquid repellence.\nElastic materials can deform actively when mechanical forces are applied on (e.g., impacting, bending, twisting, compressing, and stretching), which avoids the fracture and removal of micro/nano structures; once the forces are withdrawn, the materials recover their original surface morphologies owing to the reversible deformation. Therefore, endowing the liquid-repellent coating and/or the underneath substrate with elasticity becomes a general method to improve their mechanical durability.58,153,196,294,375,490 It was demonstrated that compared with rigid superhydrophobic surface, a water droplet impacting an elastic superhydrophobic surface showed a two-fold reduction in the contact time between the droplet and surface.491 This was attributed to the distinct post-impacting kinetic-to-elastic energy conversion between the droplet and elastic substrate, which enabled the substrate to oscillate upon impacting, and then applied vertical momentum back to the droplet with a springboard effect during the droplet retraction, resulting in a rapid droplet bouncing with reduced contact time and an improved durability towards droplet impacting.\nBy mimicking the exoskeleton of insects, Hoshian et al. proposed a robust hybrid PDMS/TiO2 superhydrophobic surface.490 The authors firstly deposited a protective TiO2 layer on a pre-roughened aluminum template by atomic layer deposition, which was then transferred to an elastic PDMS scaffold via sacrificial release etching. Without any further surface treatment, the resultant hybrid PDMS/TiO2 replicas showed robust and durable superhydrophobicity towards mechanical abrasion, knife scratch, rubbing, bending, tape peeling, high temperature annealing, UV exposure, water jet impinging and long-term underwater storage (90 days). The robustness and durability resulted from a thick nanostructured elastic substrate that was conformally covered by a TiO2 layer instead of a monolayer hydrophobic coating. As shown in Fig. 49a, the pure TiO2 nanostructure was likely to be broken under mechanical stress, while the elastic PDMS structure alone would stick to itself due to self-adhesiveness. By contrast, for the hybrid PDMS/TiO2 coatings, the TiO2 nanostructures bended during mechanical contact and the elastic PDMS part allowed their recovery after unloading, while the TiO2 film prevented the PDMS self-adhesiveness. Although TiO2 film might break down into small pieces due to mechanical stress in the abrasion test, the elastic PDMS scaffold kept these pieces in place as the TiO2 film was strongly adhered to the elastomer. Based on the similar strategy, they reported a robust PDMS/Cu superhydrophobic composite material that could withstand 1000 cycles of mechanical abrasion and 10,000 cycles of stretching and bending recently.294\nAs shown in Fig. 49b, when a hydrophobic TiO2 nanoparticles coated elastic VHB 4910 film was equi-biaxially stretched with stretch ratio \u03bb = 3, the micro/nanostructured TiO2 clusters were diluted and the film thereby lost its superhydrophobicity, which could be easily recovered by releasing the film (\u03bb = 1) due to its excellent elasticity.153 Dai et al. fabricated a robust superhydrophobic film based on magnetic field-assisted in situ formation of PDMS microcilia arrays and subsequent swelling-assisted decoration of silica nanoparticles.347 Due to the elasticity of the PDMS matrix and the robust adhesion of the silica nanoparticles, the as-prepared film showed robust super water repellence towards finger rubbing, ultrasonic treatment, cyclic compression, high-speed water jet impacting, tape peeling, sandpaper abrasion, as well as periodical linear stretching, bending, twisting and squeezing.\nSMPs have been employed to construct self-healing liquid-repellent surfaces based on the shape memory effect originating from external-stimulus-dependent molecular chain configuration and mobility.494,495 For example, Bai et al. prepared superhydrophobic surface on various thermal-responsive SMPs by femtosecond laser texturing and subsequent fluoroalkylsilane treatment.492,496 After being heated and pressed, the surface lost its superhydrophobicity due to the surface topography deformation, which could be regenerated through a simple reheating at 80 \u00b0C for ~ 3 min (Fig. 49c).\nBesides, Manna et al. reported a healable superhydrophobic surface based on liquid water-induced swelling of polymer coating.493 They deposited porous rough polymer multilayers by layer-by-layer assembly of branched poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) and the amine-reactive polymer poly(vinyl-4,4-dimethylazlactone) (PVDMA), and the coating became superhydrophobic (water CA of 156\u00b0) after treating with n-decylamine (Fig. 49d). After being crushed with a glass slide under a pressure of ~ 6.4 MPa for 1 min, the micro/nano-scale features were completely damaged, and the water CA decreased to ~ 130\u00b0. However, when the crushed sample was immersed in deionized water for 1 h and then dried under vacuum, the topographic features were almost completely regenerated and superhydrophobicity was restored. Moreover, this recovery process was substantially faster when the crushed films were incubated at low pH (e.g., a complete recovery was realized within 60 s in 200 mM acetate buffer with pH of 3), which was probably due to the protonation of the amines of the PEI component speeding up the swelling of the polymer coating.\nHowever, if the surface textures are removed (e.g., by abrasion), regeneration of the rough structures under suitable external stimuli may be effective in healing the liquid repellence. For instance, Wang et al. reported thermo-induced self-healing of superhydrophobic coating prepared by using self-assembled flaky micro/nano structures of cellulose-derived phase-change nanocrystals.497 The authors firstly hydrolyzed microcrystalline cellulose by using hydrochloric acid to extract cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), which were then modified with 10-undecenoylchloride in pyridine under heterogeneous reaction conditions to synthesize undecenoated cellulose nanocrystals (UCNCs), and then 1-octadecanethiol was grafted in the shell layer of the UCNCs containing terminal vinyl groups via thiol-ene reaction to prepare 1-octadecanethiolated UCNCs (C18-UCNCs) (Fig. 50a). The C18-UCNCs possessed a distinct core-shell structure: the cellulose crystalline core retained the basic structure and the soft shell containing octadecyl\nchains allowed phase transition. During the evaporation from its tetrahydrofuran suspension, the phase transition of the C18-UCNCs shell led to the formation of self-assembled flaky micro/nano structures with superhydrophobicity (Fig. 50b), by which both self-standing C18-UCNCs films and coatings on other substrates with super water repellence could be obtained. The assembled flaky hierarchical structures showed limited mechanical durability towards abrasion by 800 mesh sandpaper under loading of 50 g and an abrasion length of 20 cm, and the damaged structures decreased the water CA of the self-standing film from ~ 160\u00b0 to ~ 115\u00b0 (Fig. 50c). After heating the damaged films at 80 \u00b0C for 30 min, cooling down, and aging at room temperature for 24 h, the flaky hierarchical structures regenerated and the films restored their superhydrophobicity (Fig. 50d), and the abrasion-healing process could be repeated for more than 10 cycles.\nMoreover, in terms of macroscopic ruptures (e.g., by knife cutting) on liquid-repellent materials, the reforming effect of coordination bonds could be used to heal the cracks and subsequently the liquid repellence.198,498,499 Jin et al. prepared a self-healing SLIS via cross-linking of dopamine-armed Fe3O4 nanoparticles, diethylenetriamine, and glycidyl methacrylate-co-polydimethylsiloxane propyl ether methacrylate, and subsequent silicone oil swelling.500 As depicted in Fig. 51a, owing to the photothermal effect of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, reversible Fe-catechol coordination, and reconfigurable lubricant layer, the cracked SLIS could be recovered after being irradiated with sunlamp for 2 h and sequentially healed for 10 h under ambient conditions (Fig. 51b). Shan et al. prepared a self-healing superhydrophobic surface by spraying polystyrene (PS) and SiO2 particles on a layer of cross-linked PDMS-based silicon elastomer containing imidazole-zinc coordination bonds.499 The imidazole group had strong coordination ability towards metal ions (e.g., Zn2+), and the pendant structure imparted the imidazole group and PDMS chains\nwith high mobility, which enabled the coating to recover its topographic structures and thus super water repellence within 20 min at room temperature when it was damaged by knife-induced ruptures (Fig. 51c)."

Then the microcapsules decorated epoxy-based SMP micropillars were fabricated via mold replication method, which showed super water repellence with water CA of 153\u00b0 and SA of 7\u00b0. Owing to the shape memory effect of the micropillar and the encapsulated agent of FAS12, the prepared superhydrophobic surface could not only restore the crushed surface textures by heat, but also heal the damaged surface chemistry under the assistance of acid stimuli (Fig. 52b).\nRecently, Yu et al. prepared a robust and durable slippery film with lubricant self-replenishing and morphology self-healing properties by encapsulating silicone oil into thermoplastic elastomers.504 As shown in Fig. 53a, polysiloxane-polyurea elastomer composite silicone oil (PDMS-IPDI@Oil) was firstly synthesized by a polycondensation reaction between aminopropyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane (NH2-PDMS-NH2) and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) in tetrahydrofuran solution containing silicone oil. Then, the terminal \u2212NH2 groups of the PDMS-IPDI@Oil further reacted with the \u2212CHO groups of the chain extender terephthalic aldehyde (TPAL) to yield PDMS-IPDI@Oil with dynamic imine bond (named as PDMS-IPDI-TPAL@Oil). Due to the reversible cleavage and reconstruction of the imine and hydrogen bonds, the damaged crack could be restored via bonds recombination (Fig. 53b). In addition, as shown in Fig. 53c, when the oil film was wiped off the surface by paper towel, the lubricant stored in the oil storage capsules could be easily released by applying 500 g of pressure on the surface, which enabled quick replenishing of the lubricant layer to recover the liquid repellence."

            "heading": "5.1.1 Anti-corrosion",
            "text": "Corrosion of metallic substances and their alloys in humid or hypersaline environments has caused waste and unsatisfactory strength of materials, environmental contamination and tremendous economic loss.32,505 Casting a robust physical barrier between substrates and corrosive medium (e.g., H2O, O2 and chloride ions) has been recognized as an effective strategy to inhibit corrosion at the interface.32,506 Superhydrophobic surfaces, superoleophobic surfaces and SLISs have attracted great interests because\nthey can effectively protect metal surfaces from being corroded.32,506,507\nIn terms of superhydrophobic and superamphiphobic surfaces, the anti-corrosion mechanism is where the air trapped in micro/nanostructures of superhydrophobic or superamphiphobic substrates protect surfaces from external environments. For example, Wang et al. endowed a magnesium alloy with robust hydrophobicity and corrosive resistance through chemical etching, zinc deposition and hydrophobic modification of ethanolic stearic acid solution.508 On exposure to corrosive saline solution (3.5 wt% NaCl solution) and humid atmosphere (relative humidity of ~ 90%), superhydrophobic samples were hardly corroded until 12 hours and 96 hours, respectively. The anti-corrosion mechanisms include (1) air film prevents interaction of corrosive ions and substrates (Fig. 54a), and (2) superhydrophobic surfaces restrain the formation of an electrolyte film (Fig. 54b). After a tape peeling test, superhydrophobic surfaces retained their robustness and exhibited no delamination or detachment. Su et al. prepared superhydrophobic coatings on copper substrates as effective corrosion barriers through a nickel electrodeposition approach and subsequent hydrophobization.509 The as-prepared superhydrophobic surface remained robust after mechanical damage (hardness and mechanical abrasion) and chemical erosion (acid and alkaline). Li et al. reported the corrosion resistance of a superhydrophobic layer on aluminum alloy substrates via a hydrothermal treatment in a La(NO3)3 solution and subsequent hydrophobic modification by dodecafluoroheptyl-propyl-trimethoxylsilane.510 The superhydrophobic surfaces showed little change after being immersed in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution for 48 h and the water CA remained above 150\u00b0. The water CAs of the as-prepared surfaces were almost unchanged after being placed in air for 80 days, being exposed to a 250 \u00b0C atmosphere or being under UV irradiation for 24 h, and were above 150\u00b0 after NaCl corrosion and abrasion. The strong bonding between lanthanum hydroxide and hydrophobic molecules formed during hydrothermal process, and hydrophobic lanthanum oxide contributed to sustaining the robustness of the resulting surfaces in harsh environments. Li et al. developed hydrophobic coatings with passivation ability for corrosion resistance of carbon steel using polyether sulfone (PES), potassium titanate whisker (PTW), nanoscale SiO2 and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane via a spraying method.511 Atomic oxygen was produced by oxygen vacancies on the surface of reduced potassium titanate whisker (RPTW) and then reacted with iron to generate passive films on carbon steel. Corrosive medium permeated micro-defects, voids, and cavities to the surface of carbon steel and then led to the corrosion of substrates (Fig. 54c). Despite of the existence of passive films, the electrolyte could still pass though the coatings and subsequently damage the passive film after long-term immersion (Fig. 54d). With the cooperative effect of passive film and air cushion, superhydrophobic layers were able to prevent the permeation of corrosive solution containing water and chloride ions (Fig. 54e).\nWith similar water-repellent property to superhydrophobic surfaces, superamphiphobic surfaces are used as a durable barrier film for protecting metal surfaces from corrosion.64,204 For example, Wei et al. revealed different anti-corrosion properties of superhydrophobic and superamphiphobic coatings for metal protection under different volumes of NaCl droplets.367 Superhydrophobic hexadecyl polysiloxane modified SiO2 nanoparticles (HD-POS@SiO2) and superamphiphobic perfluorodecyl polysiloxane modified SiO2 nanoparticles (PF-POS@SiO2) were coated on magnesium alloy that was pretreated with epoxy paint (EP) via a spray-coating method, respectively. For water droplets larger than 0.9 \u03bcL, superhydrophobic and superamphiphobic coatings displayed the same wettability; hence superamphiphobic coatings showed better water repellent properties when water droplets were smaller than 0.9 \u03bcL. This was attributed to the lower surface energy of C\u2212F in PF-POS@SiO2 nanoparticles than that of C\u2212H groups in HD-POS@SiO2 nanoparticles. When small NaCl droplets adhered stably on the superhydrophobic coating, water (or vapor), oxygen and chloride ions diffused through the coating and then seriously eroded the metal substrates. However, affected by low-surface-energy C\u2212F groups in PF-POS@SiO2 coatings, NaCl micro-droplets rolled off from the surface easily, the limited contact time\nand area between the NaCl droplets and superamphiphobic surface contributed to restricting the diffusion of corrosive medium effectively. In addition, robust superamphiphobic coatings could retain remarkable anti-corrosion performance after long-term immersion and neutral salt spray test.\nFor SLISs that are applied in metal corrosion protection, the mechanism was similar to that of superhydrophobic surfaces, the air cushion trapped in hierarchical surfaces is replaced by a lubricant film.32 For example, Sun et al. reported robust SLIS with excellent anti-corrosion performance via mimicking Nepenthes pitcher plant.512 The SLIS were prepared as follows: \u03b1-zirconium phosphate (ZrP)/epoxy suspensions were coated on different substrates, followed by construction of superhydrophobic PTFE/graphite fluoride (GrF) micro/nanostructure layer, and perfluoropolyether (PFPE) infusion (Fig. 54f). The water CA and SA were respectively ~ 118\u00b0 and ~ 2.3\u00b0, and the cetane CA was ~ 61\u00b0, and thus the oil layer possessed water resistance as well as resisted liquids with low surface tension. The impedance modulus of SLIS-coated steel (|Z|f = 0.01 Hz = 9.96 \u00d7 10 7 \u03a9\u00b7cm2) was much higher than pure steel (|Z|f = 0.01Hz = 8.89 \u00d7 10 2 \u03a9\u00b7cm2), demonstrating a good anti-corrosion property. The corrosion protection mechanisms of the SLIS are (i) chemically inert and low-surface-energy hydrophobic layer (PTFE/GrF) prevented the invasion of corrosive medium, (ii) ZrP plates prolonged the pathway of the corrosive medium to the substrate (Fig. 54g). Besides, SLIS coatings kept robust and still displayed water CA of > 110\u00b0 and SA of < 10\u00b0 even after 30-day immersion in acidic and alkali solutions. Chen et al. developed slippery surfaces coated on porous aluminum oxide for corrosion resistance using environmentally friendly ionic liquid via a polymerization process.471 With the assistance of capillarity and intermolecular interaction, low-surface-energy ionic liquid and porous surfaces were interacted firmly, leading to the stability of solid-liquid interfaces. The as-prepared surfaces (Ecorr = \u20130.701 V, Icorr = \u20138.71 A cm\u22122) exhibited a better corrosion resistance than pristine aluminum oxide surfaces (Ecorr = \u20130.764 V, Icorr = \u20136.897 A cm\u22122). Additionally, slippery ionic liquid-infused surfaces exhibited outstanding temperature stability and stability of resistance to shear stress.\nGenerally, owing to better stability of the infused lubricant layer in comparison with the air cushion, SLISs have been demonstrated to be more effective in anti-corrosion than superhydrophobic and superoleophobic surfaces.513-515 For example, Zhang et al. compared the anti-corrosion property of superhydrophobic surface and SLIS.514 Chemical etching of an aluminum alloy in aqueous FeCl3 solution and PFDTS modification enabled the preparation of the superhydrophobic surface, and subsequent perfluoropolyethers lubricant infusion yielded the SLIS. Corrosion inhibition evaluation showed that the SLIS retained its original anti-corrosion ability after immersing in 3.5 wt% NaCl aqueous solution for 7 days, while the superhydrophobic surface almost lost its corrosion resistance."

            "text": "Anti-fouling surfaces show significant roles in a wide range of areas, such as medical devices, maritime industries, and food packaging.516 Nature inspired liquid-repellent surfaces, including superhydrophobic surfaces, underwater superoleophobic surfaces, and SLISs have been employed to protect the underlying substrates from being contaminated by foulants such as protein, bacterial, algae, and blood, enabling\nliquid-repellent surfaces to be potentially employed in biomedical and marine applications, etc.517 This section introduces the application of liquid-repellent surfaces in anti-fouling.\nSuperhydrophobic surfaces have been successfully used for inhibition of foulants due to the trapped air \u201ccushion\u201d prevents intimate contact between the surfaces and aqueous solutions containing foulants.517-519 For example, Leibner et al. found that a superhydrophobic expanded PTFE surface showed negligible adsorption towards human serum albumin, which was, however, totally changed after being evacuated to remove the trapped air prior to contact with protein solutions.520 Similarly, the effect of air \u201cchshion\u201d on preventing protein adsorption was also verified on a superhydrophobic/superhydrophilic patterned surface with TiO2 nanotubes. 521 Dou et al. investigated wettability regulated Gram-positive bacteria adhesion on bioinspired hierarchical structures duplicated from rose petal structures whose surface wettability were then tuned from superhydrophilicity to superhydrophobicity by changing the interfacial chemical composition of the self-assembled films from supramolecular gelators.522 Results demonstrated that the Gram-positive bacteria adhesion was crucially mediated by peptidoglycan (PGN) due to its different interaction mechanisms with the surfaces (Fig. 55a). Owing to the tightly bound water layer on the superhyrophilic surface, weak H-bonded driving force between PGN and the surface enabled a 0.32 ng cm\u22122 adsorption of PGN. Increased H-bonding interaction on hydrophilic surface and hydrophobic interaction on hydrophobic surface resulted in 1.86 ng cm\u22122 and 2.12 ng cm\u22122 adsorption of PGN on hydrophilic surface and hydrophobic surface, respectively. By contrast, the trapped air \u201ccushion\u201d on superhydrophobic surface minimized the hydrophobic interaction area between PGN and the surface, leading to the best bacteria adhesion resistance with PGN adsorption of only 0.11 ng cm\u22122. Wang et al. prepared micro/nanoscale diamond films on different substrates via CVD and self-assembly seeding method, and showed that compared with flat diamond coatings, the superhydrophobic hierarchical diamond coatings showed better anti-fouling performances towards bacterial and marine algae.179\nSuperhydrophobic surfaces also showed enhanced anti-blood-adhesion ability, making them promising in enhancing the hemocompatibility of blood-contacting devices and implants (e.g., wound dressing, catheter, endoscopes and stents).39,523-527 Blood is a challenging liquid to repel due to its easily-activated intrinsic hemostatic mechanisms, induction of coagulation, and platelet activation upon contact with foreign incompatible surfaces.39 Jiang el al. prepared superhydrophobic TiO2 coatings on biomedical Ti-6Al-4V alloys via micro-arc oxidation technique and subsequent surface fluorination by 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl-trichlorosilane, by which the in vitro hemocompatibility of the alloy was greatly improved since the superhydrophobic coatings reduced the hemolysis ratio and platelets adhesion effectively.523 Nokes et al. investigated the blood coagulation on superhydrophobic plastics that were constructed by roll-to-roll shrinking of a pre-stressed thermoplastic.524 Results showed that the superhydrophobic surface minimized blood adhesion, leading to significantly reduced blood coagulation compared to flat surface (> 5 times reduction after 50 min testing) without the need of anticoagulants, as depicted in Fig. 55b. Bartlet et al. prepared superhydrophobic TiO2 nanotube array surfaces by anodization, annealing, and low surface energy modification, and evaluated their hemocompatibility.525\nResults showed that compared with original Ti and unmodified TiO2 nanotube arrays surfaces, the superhydrophobic nanotube arrays surfaces effectively reduced albumin and fibrinogen adsorption, human platelet rich plasma cell adhesion, and platelet activation. By focusing mainly on platelet anti-adhesion, Jokinen et al. proposed that superhydrophobic surfaces repel blood because they can (i) reduce the effective area exposed to platelets, (ii) reduce the adhesion area available to individual platelets, (iii) reduce platelet adhesion via hydrodynamic slip effects, and (iv) reduce or alter protein adsorption in a way that is not conducive to thrombus formation.39 However, most of the above-mentioned results are obtained from in vitro studies, and the in vivo testing of the anti-blood-adhesion property and medical safety aspects of superhydrophobic surfaces are rarely focused on,375,527,528 and more in-depth in vivo studies are required to fill the largely unknown area in the future.\nThe durability of the anti-fouling ability of superhydrophobic surfaces during long-term usage remains\nchallenging, as the air \u201ccushion\u201d tends to disappear. For example, Hwang et al. investigated the bacterial adhesion on various substrates including glass slide, polyurethane, white polystyrene sheet, and superhydrophobic surface.529 Results showed that the superhydrophobic surface exhibited obvioulsy reduced bacterial adhesion compared to the control surfaces after 1 h of exposure to a bacterial suspension in either brain-heart-infusion (BHI) broth or phosphate buffered saline (PBS), as exampled in Fig. 55c. However, the anti-fouling of superhydrophobic surface was short-lived and that the bacteria attachment increased greatly after 24 h exposure in either BHI or PBS. As depicted in Fig. 55d, compared to glass, there was a 9-fold increase in the density of adherent bacteria to the superhydrophobic surface for clinical strain of E. coli expressing a carbapenemase enzyme (CRE 1030) in BHI. This was attributed to the loss of the air layer on superhydrophobic surface after prolonged immersion in liquids (e.g., BHI), and the rough structures unexpectedly functioned as reservoirs to enhance bacterial colonization over the longer term. Therefore, it is of great importance to improve the durability of the air \u201ccushion\u201d of superhydrophobic surfaces in order to realize long-term anti-fouling (Section 4). In addition, superhydrophobic surfaces combined with anti-fouling agents have been used to resist foulants aiming to improve the anti-fouling performance and long-term anti-fouling efficiency.530,531\nSimilar to the trapped air \u201ccushion\u201d on superhydrophobic surfaces, the tightly adsorbed and locked water layer on pre-wetted superhydrophilic/underwater superoleophobic surfaces can prevent direct contact between the surfaces and foulants, which thereby protects the substrates from being contaminated by foulants.522,532 For example, Chen et al. developed robust superhydrophilic/underwater superoleophobic and anti-biofouling coatings on glass substrates based on the assembly of hierarchical microgel spheres.533 The hierarchical microgel spheres were prepared by coating SiO2 particles on microgel spheres via complexing interaction. Subsequently, the hierarchical structures were hydrophilized using a hydrophilic block copolymer, which were then coated on glass via a self-assembly method, followed by coating a thermoset resin layer, washing using ethyl acetate and curing. The as-prepared coatings effectively protected the substrates from being fouled by bovine serum albumin protein (Fig. 56a), a significantly decreased protein adsorption (~ 3 \u03bcg cm\u22122) was found on the coating. Moreover, after sandpaper abrasion and 30 days incubation, the coatings still exhibited excellent anti-fouling performance (Fig. 56a) with extremely low protein adsorption (<10 \u03bcg cm\u22122), suggesting long-term anti-fouling ability of the superhydrophilic coatings. In addition, superhydrophilic/underwater superoleophobic surfaces also show anti-oil-adhesion property when they are immersed in water.240 For example, Chen et al. synthesized nacre-inspired hydrophilic mineralized films coated on different substrates using inorganic aragonite and chitosan derivatives.67 The oil CA and SA of the obtained films were 162.3 \u00b1 2.7\u00b0 and 1.6 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0, indicating their low-oil-adhesion property. For a mineralized film coated swimming goggles, the oil stain could be easily removed and became clean immediately after being immersed in water (Fig. 56b), and a coated lens of camera remained its high transparency and high-quality observation in oil-water environment (Fig. 56c).\nContinuous and stable lubricant films locked on SLISs can effectively prevent the contact between foulants and substrates, enabling the SLISs to be capable of resisting fouling adhesion.11,20,279,357 Epstein et al. investigated the anti-fouling performance of SLISs by using lubricant infused porous PTFE substrate or microstructured fluoro-silanized Si wafer.534 They showed that the SLISs could prevent 99.6% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm attachment over a 7 days period, as well as Staphylococcus aureus (97.2%) and Escherichia coli (96%), while superhydrophobic control surfaces attached biofilms within hours, under both static and physiologically realistic flow conditions (10 mL min\u22121). As evidenced in Fig. 57a, after 48 h of room temperature growth in static culture, uniform biofilm coverage was observed on the superhydrophobic surface, while only sparse and isolated cells were seen on the SLIS. Similar results were observed on the two surfaces after 7 days\u2019 growth in 10 mL min\u22121 flow condition (Fig. 57b). Manabe et al. reported an anti-thrombogenic slippery film composed of chitosan and alginate.535 The film was prepared via a combination of electrostatic interactions between chitosan and alginate and hydrogen-bonding between alginate and polyvinylpyrrolidone via layer-by-layer self-assembly method. After cross-linking of the chitosan and alginate, the hydrogen-bonding component was removed by immersing in buffer solution with pH of 10 to generate a porous film, which was then hydrophobized and infused with almond oil to construct a SLIS. Blood could easily flow off the SLIS\nwithout leaving any stains, and blood coagulation on the surface was significantly delayed, demonstrating anti-blood-adhesion and anti-thrombogenicity of the SLIS. Lee et al. prepared fouling resistant SLISs on endoscope lens by femtosecond laser texturing, a fluorinated monolayer self-assembly, and infusion of medical-grade perfluorocarbon lubricants.536 The resultant SLISs showed excellent blood repellence and anti-protein adsorption properties. After immersing bare glass and the SLIS in aqueous protein solutions (blood mixed with either albumin or fibrinogen) and incubated for 24 h, the fluorescence imaging clearly demonstrated that significant amounts of protein were attached on the bare glass surface, whereas negligible attachment was observed on the SLIS, as shown in Fig. 57c and d. By incorporating SLISs, various medical devices, such as scalpels,272,537 endoscope lens,536 intranasal splints,538 and silicone rubber tubes,539 with enhanced anti-fouling ability have been manufactured and tested in vitro.\nDurability of the lubricant \u201ccushion\u201d greatly influences the long-term liquid repellence and anti-fouling\nperformance of SLISs, which could be well addressed by the strategies discussed in Section 4. For instance, Tesler et al. developed slippery tungstite oxide (TO) films on steel surfaces with excellent anti-fouling properties via an electrodeposition method.537 Hydrophilic TO covered steel surfaces became superhydrophobic (termed as TO-SHS) after being modified with perfluoroalkyl-bearing phosphate. Subsequently, TO-SLIS was prepared by infusing TO-SHS with perfluoropolyether lubricants. When the untreated, TO-SHS and TO-SLIS scalpels were immersed into blood and then washed by water, TO-SLIS scalpels exhibited remarkable blood-repellent property (Fig. 57e). Besides, TO-SLIS possessed more outstanding resistance performance towards reducing bacterial and green algae adhesion than that of the untreated and the TO-SHS. The TO-SLIS coatings retained their liquid repellence after being damaged by abrasion due to their self-healing property. Wei et al. synthesized slippery hybrid coatings with long-term stability for biofouling resistance.339 Low-surface-energy surface with nanostructures on glass or aluminum substrates were fabricated by using methyltriethoxysilane, tetraethyl orthosilicate and n-octyltriethoxysilane via a polycondensation method, and then were infused with silicon oil to obtain slippery coatings. The prepared coatings could protect the substrates from being contaminated by blood and bacteria, and even inhibited protein adsorption. Owing to the abundant internal cross-linked networks and nanostructures of the hybrid coatings, the SLISs could store the silicon oil stably and maintain excellent long-term slippery properties even under accelerated lubricant depletion conditions, such as evaporating at 70 \u00b0C for 7 days and immersing in flowing aqueous systems for 7 days. Recently, Hong et al. investigated the optimization of perfluorinated SLISs for blood-contacting applications.540 The authors prepared tethered-perfluorocarbon layers containing large bumpy aggregates (300 \u00b1 200 nm thick) on top of an underlying uniform coating (35 \u00b1 15 nm thick) by a vapor phase silanization reaction, which were then infused with perfluoroperhydrophenanthrene or perfluorodecalin to create SLISs. Although the two lubricants were similar in preventing fibrin adhesion from human whole blood, the higher viscosity of perfluoroperhydrophenanthrene than perfluorodecalin (28.2 mPa\u00b7s vs 5.1 mPa\u00b7s) made it the preferred lubricant for reducing thrombosis in medical applications under blood flow condition due to its greater resistance towards shear-flow induced depletion.\nSuperhydrophobic surfaces could effectively reduce foulants adhesion in a short time, but their anti-fouling performance was barely satisfactory towards liquids/foulants with low surface tensions541 or when the air \u201ccushion\u201d was lost during long-term repelling.529 For superhydrophilic/underwater superoleophobic surfaces, most studies mainly focus on their oil repellence rather than their anti-fouling property. SLISs show more remarkable and long-lasting anti-fouling performance than superhydrophobic surfaces,20,534,537,539 but the problem of lubricant depletion is still challenging. Moreover, in vivo study of the anti-fouling of liquid-repellent surfaces are urgently required so as to promote their practical applications. 5.1.3 Ice-phobicity Undesired ice accumulation on solid surfaces causes tremendous damage to commercial and residential activities.542,543 For example, countries in northern latitudes usually face enormous economic losses and\nvarious safety hazards when their infrastructures or devices are covered with ice, such as power lines, ships, aircrafts and roads in winter.544 Traditional methods, such as cracking ice by inflating, melting ice by thermal/chemical induction, and chemicals incorporated protective coatings, could be used to mitigate ice threats, but these techniques are energy consuming, environmentally harmful, or not reliably up to the goal.435,545 To overcome these challenges, liquid-repellent surfaces possessing passive anti-icing ability to significantly suppress ice nucleation, to impede frosting and to lower ice adhesion force have been widely developed recently.30,545-548 In this section, the application of superhydrophobic surfaces and SLISs in ice-phobicity are introduced.\nIce accumulation often occurs when water droplets come into contact with solid surfaces that are at temperatures below the freezing point. For an ice phase to be initiated and grow, favorable conditions for stable nucleation must be fulfilled, i.e., the Gibbs free energy barrier for ice embryo formation must be overcome.549 Classical nucleation theory is frequently employed to describe the formation of ice. Fig. 58a shows the condition required for homogeneous ice nucleation to proceed, which is depicted by the relationship between the change in Gibbs free energy (\u0394G) and the radius of ice embryo (ri), and the \u0394G could be decomposed into the ice-liquid interface contribution (\u0394GS) and the volumetric contribution (\u0394GV). Fig. 58a also shows that at a given temperature an ice nucleus must reach a critical radius, ri,c, for freezing to initiate and propagate, indicating an energetically favorable growth of the ice embryo when ri exceeds ri,c. Spatially, nucleation can occur within a liquid droplet at the free gas-liquid interface (i.e., homogeneous nucleation, Fig. 58b) or the liquid-solid interface (i.e., heterogeneous nucleation, Fig. 58c).550 Meanwhile, the \u0394G is shown to be a function of surface temperature and ice-water interfacial energy, and the \u0394G for heterogeneous nucleation is lower than that for homogeneous nucleation at a given temperature.549 Also, it was suggested that surface-based approaches are effective in preventing heterogeneous nucleation.551 Therefore, the ice-phobicity of liquid-repellent surfaces could be attributed to the two following strategies: minimizing the contact time between droplets and surface to accelerate the shedding of droplets before ice nucleation occurs, and delaying heterogeneous nucleation through the optimization of surface roughness, chemistry and topography.30\nMinimized contact time are commonly observed when water droplets impinging on superhydrophobic surfaces due to the trapped air and extremely low CAH of the surfaces,552-554 which enables them to prevent ice formation effectively even under temperatures below freezing point.435,546,555-557 For example, Mishchenko et al. compared the dynamic droplet freezing behaviors on hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and superhydrophobic surfaces.435 As shown in Fig. 58d, the authors demonstrated that the impinging droplets attached and froze on hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces due to incomplete retraction (i.e., the contact time was long enough for nucleation and freezing), while that on superhydrophobic surface rapidly bounced away (i.e., extremely short contact time) before freezing occurred at surface temperatures above \u221225 \u00b0C, which rendered the superhydrophobic surface ice-phobic. Bahadur et al. developed a model to predict ice formation on cooled superhydrophobic surfaces under impact of super-cooled water droplets.558 The model showed that when a droplet impacted a super-cooled surface and the contact time was long\nenough to initiate ice nucleation at the tips of the posts, the retraction force responsible for de-wetting of the impacting droplet was thereby decreased, which eventually resulted in incomplete retraction, pinning and complete freezing of the droplet; if the contact time was less than the time required to induce pinning, the droplet would rebound completely and there was no ice formed. Meanwhile, a reduction in temperature increases the viscosity of water, for example, the viscosity shows a 5-fold increase at \u221227 \u00b0C compared to room temperature (23 \u00b0C).304 The resulting stronger viscous dissipation effects significantly influences the impacting dynamics of the water droplet, causing partial meniscus penetration and retarding/preventing droplet retraction, which thereby increases the contact time and facilitates icing.304,559 Consequently, ensuring stable Cassie-Baxter wetting state and minimized contact time of the impacting droplets, particularly of those extremely supercooled ones, are crucial for the ice-phobicity of superhydrophobic surfaces. However, if a droplet impacts a superhydrophobic surface with sufficient kinetic energy, it may penetrate the surface textures and displace the trapped air \u201ccushion\u201d, and finally become pinned in the Wenzel state, resulting in the loss of superhydrophobicity and thereby the ice-phobicity. As discussed in section 4.2.2, micro/nano structures, such as closed-cell features435 and closely packed nanostructures,560 can be created or integrated to increase the capillary pressure of the surface textures and to resist the transition from the Cassie-Baxter state to the Wenzel state, thereby improving the anti-icing capacity of superhydrophobic surfaces.30\nAlthough dynamic bouncing and rapid shedding of impinging droplets can significantly enhance the anti-icing property of superhydrophobic surfaces, it becomes important to delay heterogeneous nucleation when the contact time is long enough to trigger ice nucleation (e.g., freezing of a static droplet).30,561,562 Generally, minimized liquid-solid contact area is crucial for the nucleation delay on superhydrophobic surfaces, which can be attributed to the reduced heat transfer between liquid and subcooled substrate, and an increased free-energy barrier for heterogeneous nucleation at the water-substrate interface.30,435,544,551 For example, Guo et al. investigated the anti-icing performance of fluorinated stainless steel surfaces with different topographies, including micro/nano structures, micro structures, nano structures and smooth structures.546 According to the delay time of ice formation on different surfaces at \u221210 \u00b0C (Fig. 59a), the micro/nanostructured superhydrophobic surfaces (CA ~ 150\u00b0) possessed the longest delay time (~ 7200 s), while nano structured surface (CA ~ 120\u00b0) and smooth/micro structured surfaces (CA < 90\u00b0) showed much shorter delay time to resist water droplets freezing (< 1740 s). Qualitative analysis showed that the liquid-solid contact area of micro/nanostructured surfaces was much lower than the other three surfaces, so less heat transfer occurred upon contacting, which resulted in higher net heat gain in unit time on the micro/nanostructured surfaces and smaller decrease in the temperature of the droplet, thereby delaying the ice nucleation.\nWhen the temperature of a superhydrophobic surface falls below the dew point, water condensates and coalesces indiscriminately within the rough structures under supersaturated condition, which gradually results in the trapping of the growing water droplets in the Wenzel state.300,560,564 Moreover, when the temperature is lower than the freezing point, frost can form either directly from the water vapor through desublimation or via freezing of the condensed water droplets. Water vapor condensation and frosting significantly enhance ice nucleation and increase ice adhesion on superhydrophobic surfaces, which thereby impedes the ice-phobicity of the surfaces under high humid atmosphere.30,549,564,565 To address these challenges, one feasible strategy is nanoscale features enabled self-propelled jumping of condensed water microdroplets, which could be observed on superhydrophobic surfaces with closely packed nanostructures or micro/nano hierarchical structures.546,560,566-571 The spontaneous jumping of microdroplets that powered by the surface energy releasing upon smaller droplets coalescence can remove the condensed droplets from the surface before heterogeneous ice nucleation occurs, which thereby improves the anti-icing property of the surfaces under high humid condition. For example, Chen et al. showed that although frosting over the entire surface was inevitable due to undesired interdroplet freezing wave propagation initiated by edge corners of the substrate, the propagation velocity of the front was up to an order of magnitude slower on superhydrophobic surfaces with nanostructures than on a flat hydrophobic surface (Fig. 59b).563 The authors also found that owing to the microscale edge effect of the hierarchical structures, the energy and structural barriers for the interdroplet freezing wave propagation were increased (Fig. 59c), which resulted in slower condensation frosting for superhydrophobic surface with hierarchical micro/nano structures compared to that with nanostructures alone. Wang et al. reported a durable ice-phobic superhydrophobic surface composing of heptadecafluorodecyl tri-propoxy silane coated PDMS micropapillae and ZnO nanohairs.556 The surface remained dry and possessed a water-rebounding ability after being placed at a temperature of \u221220 \u00b0C and a relative humidity of 90% for 3 months, which were attributed to the ZnO nanostructures repelling condensed droplets, and the PDMS micropapillae suspending droplets and cushioning the pressure from droplets impacting.\nAnother strategy is to replace the trapped air \u201ccushion\u201d of superhydrophobic surfaces with lubricant \u201ccushion\u201d, namely, to create SLISs to enhance the ice-phobicity of solid substrates, particularly in highly humid conditions.29,30,548,572-574 Kim et al. investigated the ice formation process of various Al surfaces, including superhydrophobic surface and SLIS, under a prolonged exposure to freezing temperature of \u22122 \u00b0C and relative humidity of 60%.572 As can be seen from Fig. 60a, after 100 min of freezing, the superhydrophobic sample had > 99% of its surface covered with ice, while only ~ 20% of the SLIS experienced ice coverage that mainly originated from the edge effect and the bulk of the SLIS remained ice-free. Benefitting from the extremely low CAH of SLISs, condensed water microdroplets as small as 100 \u03bcm in diameter became highly mobile and moved continuously at speeds that were several orders of magnitude higher than those on identically textured superhydrophobic surfaces, and finally departed the surface before freezing.572,573 Meanwhile, SLISs exhibited significantly decreased nucleation temperature of supercooled water, reduced heterogeneous nucleation, and lowered frost propagation velocity, which\nfurther improved the ice-phobicity of SLISs.575,576 However, the migration and depletion of the lubricant during icing and de-icing have to be considered since they would inevitably weaken the liquid repellence as well as the ice-phobicity of SLISs.547,577,578 Optimized selection of lubricant and underlying surface chemistry can stabilize the infused lubricant firmly through enhanced chemical affinity (section 4.1), and nanostructured surface textures can improve the retention of the lubricant \u201ccushion\u201d of SLISs via increased capillary pressure (section 4.2.2), all of which contribute to the durability of their ice-phobicity during repeated icing/de-icing.30,573 Wong et al. put forward a method of preventing lubricant depletion during anti-icing of SLIS, involving the capillary pressure provided by nanostructures being greater than the capillary-induced suction pressure caused by frost dendrites.547 Both microstructured and nanostructured SLISs were constructed on the same micropillar array, but differences occurred between them when both surfaces were infused with silicone oil with or without the addition of epoxy-amine nanoparticles. Nanostructured SLIS possessing smaller interstitial spacing (30 nm) than microstructured SLIS (18 \u03bcm) and provided much stronger capillary retentive forces, resulting in reduced lubricant depletion during icing (Fig. 60b, c). As a result, the lubricant film of microstructured SLIS was damaged while that of nanostructured SLIS remained unchanged during condensation-frosting process. After 50 de-icing cycles, there was no obvious lubricant loss in the nanostructured SLIS, indicating its exceptional durability. In addition, imparting SLISs with self-healing property (section 4.4) can also be an alternative method to improve their ice-phobicity for long-term icing/de-icing applications.56,579\nAlthough liquid-repellent surfaces show remarkable anti-icing property, ice eventually forms on even the best liquid-repellent surfaces under extreme conditions, making de-icing a key consideration for the evaluation of ice-phobicity. Typically, shearing the ice from a surface using a force probe, or removing the ice using centrifugation are two most widely used techniques to measure ice adhesion strength. Owing to the minimized direct contact between ice and solid substrates, superhydrophobic surfaces siginificantly decrease the ice adhesion strength.564,580-583 For example, Song et al. prepared superhydrophobic concrete with excellent anti-icing property by a metal mesh covering and hydrophobic modification of fluoroalkylsilane.66 When the sloping angles of the prepared superhydrophobic surfaces were larger than their SA, water droplets easily rolled off from the as-prepared surfaces while droplets firmly adhered on unmodified surfaces and were then frozen into ice. By placing the samples horizontally and forming ice on them, de-icing test by using a force gauge showed that the ice adhesion strength on untreated concrete was about 1496.9 kPa, while that on superhydrophobic concrete was only 113.3 kPa. It has to be noted that the ice-phobicity of superhydrophobic surfaces may deteriorate due to the rough morphologies can be destroyed during de-icing process.56,564,584-586 SLISs can effectively prevent the direct contact between condensed water droplets and solid substrate, thereby exhibiting ultra small ice adhesion strength as low as several kPa.56,572,578,586 However, this will gradually lose when the lubricant layer was depelted during cyclic icing/de-icing,56,578,587 emphasizing the importance of stabilizing the lubricant \u201ccushion\u201d of SLISs. For example, Long et al. put SLIS and superhydrophobic surfaces in water with a tilting angle of 30\u00b0 at \u221215 \u00b0C for 24 h and then compared their anti-icing performance.588 Results showed that both the SLIS and superhydrophobic surface could be easily drawn out from the ice after freezing, but the ice adhesion strength on SLIS (6.2 kPa) was much lower than that on the superhydrophobic surface (35.2 kPa). After 12 icing/drawing cycles, the water CAs of the superhydrophobic surface decreased from 156.1\u00b0 to 108.9\u00b0 due to the gradually damaged micro/nanostructures during de-icing, while that of the SLIS remained almost unchanged (~ 106.3\u00b0) as the lubricant layer kept homogeneous and smooth, demonstrating that the ice-phobicity of the SLIS was robust and durable."

            "heading": "5.2 Liquid/Gas Harvesting, Transport and Manipulation",
            "text": "The manipulation of liquid or gas in air or under water has aroused great interest in many fields, such as water purification/collection,160,589-593 controllable chemical microreactors,594-596 gas bubbles capture and transport,597-600 droplet-based actuators,601,602 and so on. In this part, liquid/gas harvesting, transport and manipulation by liquid-repellent surfaces are introduced. Additionally, advantages and disadvantages of these surfaces applied in the same fields will be discussed and summarized.\nTo date, two strategies have been used for water manipulation on superhydrophobic surfaces in air, (a) utilization of different water adhesion on different superhydrophobic surfaces for no-loss water transportation in a programmable way; (b) loss-free water motion in one direction on superhydrophobic surfaces with the help of external driving forces.603 Theoretically, whether two methods can be applied for water manipulation is primarily related to water wetting states on superhydrophobic surfaces. For example, inspired by rose petals, Tan et al. regulated superhydrophobicity and adhesive force of\nas-prepared interfaces for microdroplets manipulation.595 The highly folded graphene oxide papillae/latex bilayer films were prepared via a three dimensional shrinking method, and subsequently modified with (heptadecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrodecy) trichlorosilane. The resulting graphene-based surfaces not only exhibited superhydrophobicity, but also showed strong water adhesion due to the existence of oxygen-containing groups, even after the modification of hydrophobic agents. Through the optimization of microstructures of papillae (microfolds or microwinkles), papillae numbers and the arrangement of papillae arrays, superhydrophobicity (water CA > 170 \u00b0) with different adhesive forces (39.2 \u00b5N to 129.4 \u00b5N) became tunable. These properties enabled the loss-free manipulation of microdroplets with different sizes. As shown in Fig. 61a, when a microdroplet with a volume of 3 \u00b5L was placed on the triangle array, it could be captured and then transferred to the hexagon array through a manipulator with square array. In contrast, the same microdroplet could not be transferred from square array to triangle array because of poor reversibility. Furthermore, these obtained films remained robust after external damages including stretching, folding, twisting and rubbing. These stable performances were attributed to the strong chemical bonding between the graphene oxide film and the latex substrate.\nIn addition to programmable manipulation of microdroplets, using external driving forces may be another strategy for precise control of microdroplets moving or stopping in any directions on superhydrophobic surfaces. For instance, Dai et al. utilized an electrostatic field to manipulate the motion of water droplets in different wetting states on a superhydrophobic PDMS surface.154 The as-prepared superhydrophobic surface possessed a water CA of 157.2 \u00b1 1.6\u00b0 and an adhesive force of 9.8 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b5N. After dynamic friction on the superhydrophobic surface, microdroplet acquired positive charges and showed a water CA of 151.1 \u00b1 2.4\u00b0 and a higher adhesive force of 59.8 \u00b1 2.6 \u00b5N, with offset Cassie-Wenzel transition state. Exposed to an electric field, a positively charged droplet moved upward on the superhydrophobic surface, and then the air cushion trapped in the micro/nanostructures returned to its original state. Its adhesive force also recovered from 59.8 \u00b5N to 9.2 \u00b5N and the water CA increased to 156.4 \u00b1 1.2\u00b0. Therefore, a droplet of charged water exhibited an onset Cassie wetting state. Under electrostatic repulsion, the water droplet displaying onset Cassie wetting state travelled for a distance of 8.2 mm in 0.3 s without any loss while the water droplet at a Cassie-Wenzel transition state pinned on the superhydrophobic surface. Wu et al. reported multimode (rolling, bouncing/reverse bouncing, converging/diffusing, climbing, 90\u00b0 turning, and sequential transport), large-volume-range, and high-speed unidirectional manipulation of microdroplets by horizontal vibration on femtosecond laser engineered slant microwall arrays (Fig. 61b), and the unidirectional transport mechanism was attributed to the variance of viscous resistance induced by the difference of contact area between the microdroplet and the slant microwalls (Fig. 61c).70 The no-loss transport/manipulations of liquids on superhydrophobic surfaces promote the development of droplet-based chemical mixing microreactors (Fig. 61d), which can guarantee the safety of experimenters, reduce the consumption/cost of chemical regents, and improve reaction rates.604 In terms of water harvesting, hydrophobic cactus spine was effectively used to collect water.605 Due to the difference of toughness and hydrophobicity on the tip and the base of cactus spines,\ndriving forces derived from the gradient of surface-free energy directionally drive water collection from the tip to the base. Laplace pressure also contributes to the water harvesting process. Bai et al. fabricated artificial cactus spines with nanogroove-based structures for water collection using micrometer silver needles and the imidization reaction of polystyrene and poly(amic acid).606 Hierarchical nanogrooves facilitated water harvesting and transportation, and the water transportation velocity was ~ 360 \u00b5m/s.\nSuperhydrophobic surfaces exhibit underwater superaerophilicity and possess high bubble adhesive force, which are used for underwater gas bubbles capture and transportation.599,608 In this process, when a superhydrophobic surface was immersed in water, a continuous layer of gas film was firstly formed on the superhydrophobic surface and then captured underwater gas bubbles. Finally, the collected bubbles were released from the as-prepared surface via Laplace pressure.607 For example, Yin et al. fabricated\nrobust superhydrophobic PTFE meshes to transport and collect underwater gas bubbles continuously.607 The hierarchical micro/nanostructures of one-sided PTFE meshes were constructed via a femtosecond laser ablation. The laser-treated side of PTFE mesh was superhydrophobic in air (water CA of 152 \u00b1 2\u00b0) and superaerophilic in water (bubble CA of 0\u00b0). The other side of the PTFE mesh was untreated, exhibiting hydrophobicity in air and aerophobicity in water. When the as-prepared mesh was immersed in water, the laser-treated side was covered with air layer while the untreated side was filled with water. Driven by its buoyancy and the Laplace pressure, air bubbles penetrated through the resulting mesh freely and continuously (Fig. 61e). However, air bubbles spread horizontally over the laser-treated side and were not allowed to pass from the laser-treated side to the untreated side. Additionally, these modified superhydrophobic PTFE meshes remained robust and stable even after corrosion and abrasion tests. In the same group, they synthesized a robust cross-shaped superaerophilic trapezoidal platform for carbon dioxide (CO2) bubbles harvesting in CO2-saturated water. 600 When a superaerophilic platform was immersed in water, underwater CO2 bubbles were captured and coalesced together, and were then transferred to the center of the cross-shaped platform via self-driven forces. Finally, bubbles were detached away from the platform due to the buoyancy. After being damaged by corrosive solutions and abrasion tests, the resulted superaerophilic trapezoidal platform remained stable and durable. Xue et al. fabricated superhydrophobic cones to continuously collect and transport CO2 bubbles with the assistance of the gradient of Laplace pressure and surface-free energy.597 The cones were prepared via gradient electrochemical corrosion using CuSO4 solution and superhydrophobic modification using SiO2 nanoparticles. The highest efficiency of CO2 bubbles collection was achieved when the apex angle was 9\u00b0. As for oils capture or harvesting, oils are normally adsorbed or filtered by superhydrophobic adsorbents or membranes. However, such superhydrophobic materials cannot be reused easily, because the oils with low surface tensions and viscous properties are extremely difficult to be removed from the superhydrophobic substrates.\nSuperhydrophobic surfaces can usually be wetted by low-surface-tension liquids (e.g., hexadecane or ethanol).609 Superamphiphobic surfaces may be a better choice than superhydrophobic surfaces in terms of the manipulation of a wide range of oils with different surface tensions.610 For example, Yao et al. fabricated Cu(OH)2 nanostructures by immersing Cu foils in 0.03 M ammonia solution at 5.0 \u00b0C for 36\u201348 h, which were then reacted with 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecanethiol in its ethanol solution (~ 0.01 M ) for 1\u201336 h to prepare superoleophobic surface in air. By controlling the reaction time (Fig. 62a) and preload force to hexadecane droplet (Fig. 62b), the adhesion between the droplet and superoleophobic surface could be well regulated.152 Depending on the tunable adhesive force, transport of hexadecane droplet was realized on the prepared superoleophobic surface in air (Fig. 62c). Chao et al. fabricated superamphiphobic Cu surfaces by nanosecond laser directly writing, followed by alkali assistant oxidation reaction, and fluoroalkylthiolate modification, whose oil adhesion performance in air could be tuned by changing the grid spacings of laser ablation.611 As the grid spacings changed from 60 \u00b5m to 480 \u00b5m, the surface roughness factor got smaller and the wetting behaviors of oils were correspondingly\ntransformed from the Cassie-Baxter state to the Wenzel state, which enabled loss-free transportation of oils by using different interfaces with programmable oil adhesion behaviors.\nCompared with the superoleophobic surfaces in air, oil droplet manipulation on underwater superoleophobic surfaces have drawn more attention due to their feasibility to control the adhesion between oil droplet and surfaces.64,613 For example, Huo et al. adjusted surface adhesive forces of different types of glass plates to manipulate oil droplets in water in a programable routine.614 By changing the ratios of flat and rough areas of glass using a femtosecond laser ablation, adhesive forces became controllable. A droplet of oil (1,2-dichloroethane, 7 \u03bcL) could be transferred from ultralow adhesive surface and then pinned on the ultrahigh adhesive surface without any oil loss in a designed routine. The same group further realized lossless oil droplet transport on underwater superoleophobic surface with ultralow oil-adhesion by changing the buoyancy of oil droplet in water solution (Fig. 62d).612 They irradiated silicon surface with femtosecond laser to construct periodic rough micro-mountain array with a period of ~ 10 \u03bcm, which showed superhydrophilicity in air and superoleophobicity underwater with ultra-low oil adhesion. As shown in Fig. 62d, the pre-deposited oil droplet on Sample A could float up when the density of water solution was increased by adding sugar, and then the droplet was captured by Sample B due to the increased buoyancy. Then Sample C was moved below the oil droplet, and the water solution was diluted to decrease the floatage on the oil droplet, which finally resulted in the transport of the oil droplet to Sample C. In practical applications, no-loss manipulation of oil microdroplets is of great importance in chemical or biological reactions.251 Additionally, superhydrophilic membranes that are\nassembled into membrane devices for oil/water separation615 or advanced funnel-like device for oils collection592 have emerged in order to transport/collect a large scale of underwater oils with high efficiency.\nSLISs have also been widely applied to liquid harvesting and manipulation due to extremely high mobility of liquid droplets deposited on them.616,617 For instance, Yang et al. reported a rice leaf inspired 3D topological SLIS with anisotropic slippery state on copper sheet that was composed of laser-ablated sub-millimeter groves, alkaline oxidizing nanotextures, and infused silicon oil.618 The nanostructures were crucial for the durability of the SLIS, while the micro textures were necessary for the anisotropy. The sliding resistance anisotropy of water droplet on this surface reached up to ~ 109.8 \u03bcN, which endowed the surface with precise directional transport of water droplets under the assistance of gravity (Fig. 63a). Additionally, as shown in Fig. 63b, by mimicking the shore bird feeding water using beak with wedge-shaped opening, the authors fabricated wedge-shaped nanotextured SLIS that could confine the droplet footprint and squeeze droplet to produce a Laplace pressure gradient, which enabled the surface to realize continuous self-driven droplet transport. Recently, inspired by rice leaves, butterfly wings and Pitcher plants, Cai et al. report a tridirectionally anisotropic slippery surface (TASS) with periodic step-like micro grooves for programmable droplet transport in three directions.619 The authors employed a two-round femtosecond laser ablation technique to construct periodic step-like micro grooves on copper plate, and then NaOH-assisted chemical oxidation was used to create nanostructures on the surface, which were followed by surface fluorination and spin-coating-assisted silicon oil infusion. The resultant TASS showed a tridirectional droplet sliding behavior, i.e., the ultra-slipperiness along the grooves with a SA of ~ 2\u00b0, and the bidirectionally anisotropic sliding perpendicular to the grooves with difference of SA up to ~ 50\u00b0, which was demonstrated to be caused by the pinning effect of the step edge. The tridirectional anisotropy of the TASS allowed unidirectional droplet transport under assistance of vertical vibration, and the transport could be controlled via the groove features, the droplet volume, and the vibration frequency, based on which programmable droplet transports, including merging/separation of droplets, sequential droplet-based chemical micro-reactions, and synthetic motion of droplets, were demonstrated on specially designed TASSs.\nSLISs can also be used for water harvesting, and in order to improve the performance, micro/nanostructures and surface chemistry on slippery surfaces should be regulated. For example, Gou et al. reported the effects of two different kinds of morphologies of SLISs on water harvesting behavior.620 The modified SLISs were prepared by etching of copper foils, morphologies control using cationic or anionic surfactants, surface hydrophobic modification, and hydrophobic lubricant infusion. SLISs with nanolamellas displayed better water collection performance (782.4 mg cm\u22122 h\u22121) than that of needles-assembled surfaces (580.8 mg cm\u22122 h\u22121) because of excellent retention of lubricant layer in nanolamellas-based structures. The as-prepared SLISs showed chemical and physical robustness under harsh environments, such as corrosive solutions, long-term storage, and ultraviolet light exposure, which was ascribed to surface textures on SLISs. Compared with plane SLIS, porous 3D frames with SLISs\nshowed more remarkable water collection capacity. For instance, Pei et al. investigated the performance of water harvesting of 3D copper foams with superhydrophobic surface and hydrophobic SLIS.69 Superhydrophilic surfaces of copper foams covered with dense nanospines were firstly prepared by an etching method using the mixed solution of NaOH and (NH4)2S2O8, and then became superhydrophobic after surface modification by CVD of fluoroalkyl silane. Hydrophobic SLISs were obtained after infusing the superhydrophobic surfaces with hydrophobic lubricant (PMX200/5cs). The modified slippery surfaces exhibited superior water collection performance (~ 800 mg cm\u22123 h\u22121) than that of superhydrophobic surfaces (~ 500 mg cm\u22123 h\u22121). This is because tiny fog droplets were captured by nanospines, grew larger and finally formed a layer of water film on superhydrophobic surfaces. In this case, the formation of water layer hindered water removal and new droplets capture on the superhydrophobic foam, resulting in unsatisfactory water collection performance. However, slippery interfaces were able to quickly capture tiny droplets and continuously promote the water transportation and removal under the synergistic effect of nanospines and low SAs, and thus the efficiency of water harvesting was improved. Additionally, these as-prepared slippery foams maintained stable fog harvesting efficiency at ~ 25% and fog harvesting rate of 15200 mg cm\u22123 h\u22121 for 30 consecutive cycles, and also retained low lubricant loss (~ 6.7%). The robustness was mainly attributed to nanospines on modified slippery foams which endowed strong capillary force, allowing lubricant to be trapped on resulted foams. In addition to hydrophobic SLISs, hydrophilic ones are developed and show exceptional water harvesting performance. For example, Dai et al. investigated water harvesting rates on different surfaces, and found that hydrophilic slippery rough surfaces (SRS) displayed faster water microdroplets nucleation and removal than those of hydrophilic or hydrophobic SLIS and hierarchical superhydrophobic surface (SHS, no lubricants) (Fig. 63c\u2013e).160 The as-prepared hydrophilic SRS were fabricated by combining the features of pitcher plants (SLIS) and rice leaves (directional and hierarchical structures) to facilitate water droplets harvesting and mobility. The performance of water harvesting on hydrophilic SRS, hydrophilic or hydrophobic SLIS and hierarchical SHS were about 500, 350, 200 and 175 mg cm\u22122 h\u22121, respectively. By tuning surface chemistry and increasing surface roughness, water collection performance could be significantly promoted. After continuous 1000 droplet shedding, liquid repellency remained excellent, as the lubricants were maintained in the nano-textured surfaces. This is because the capillary force in nanostructures protected lubricants from being damaged. Additionally, lubricant detachment could be further reduced by using lubricants with higher viscosity.\nBesides water harvesting, SLISs have also been designed to manipulate underwater bubbles dependent on buoyancy.621,622 For example, Wang et al. prepared a slippery track with remarkable mechanical stability for underwater bubbles manipulation.623 Superhydrophobic coatings were constructed on porous alumina ceramic substrates under UV irradiation using the mixtures of vinyl triethoxy silane, hydrophobic fumed silicas and photo initiator. Afterwards, SLISs were obtained when silicone oils were infused into the porous superhydrophobic substrates. The as-prepared slippery track exhibited underwater bubble CA of 72.8 \u00b1 3.8\u00b0 and possessed the ability to transport bubbles (10 \u03bcL) from lower to upper surface of an\nS-shaped track (Fig. 63f). The mechanism of bubbles moving is as follows: driving forces originated from adhesion and buoyancy promoted the motion of bubbles when the slippery track was tilted at a certain angle (Fig. 63g). When the samples were soaked in water for 28 days, owing to the existence of hydrophobic fumed silica, the as-prepared surfaces retained excellent slippery performance and maintained the SA of below 10\u00b0, showing a stable and durable silicone oil layer. As discussed above, superhydrophobic surfaces are also able to capture and deliver underwater bubbles, primarily relying on Laplace pressure as a driving force, which was induced from asymmetric geometric structures of superhydrophobic surfaces, such as trapezoidal and cone or star-based shapes.621 However, it may be ineffective for superhydrophobic surfaces under pressure or highly humid atmosphere because of the disappearance of the air cushion; while SLISs could always self-repair the lubricant once the layers are damaged.620,624\nperformance of water harvesting of different surfaces.

In this combination, water microdroplets are absorbed and condensate on hydrophilic areas, and the superhydrophobic areas promote the efficiency of water removal. For example, in nature, desert beetle, Stenocara, with a hydrophilic/superhydrophobic patterned surface on its back, possesses a unique ability for water collection from fog-rich wind.589,591 The elytra of the desert beetle are covered with an array of bumps, whose sizes are ~ 0.5 mm in diameter (Fig. 64a). The peaks of bumps are smooth and wax-free (hydrophilic) while troughs consist of microstructure covered with wax (Fig. 64b). These microstructures are flattened hemispheres in shape with the diameter of ~ 10 \u03bcm and exhibit superhydrophobicity (Fig. 64c).589 Water microdroplets from moist atmosphere condensate and then coalesce on hydrophilic regions, which are viewed as nucleation sites. After reaching a critical size, water droplets are transported to the beetles\u2019 mouths through superhydrophobic areas (wax regions) when the beetles tilt their bodies.625 According to this interesting natural phenomenon, Yin et al. reported a robust hybrid hydrophilic/superhydrophobic copper-based surface for efficient water harvesting.626 They adhered copper mesh onto the top of a PTFE sheet and then scanned the resulting sample by femtosecond laser line-by-line, during which PTFE particles were deposited on the mesh due to the re-solidification of the ejected PTFE nanoparticles during laser exposure. The resultant PTFE-coated copper mesh showed super water repellence with water CA of 159 \u00b1 2\u00b0, water SA of 3\u00b0 and low water adhesion. By tightly assembling the superhydrophobic copper mesh with a naturally hydrophilic copper sheet, a hydrophilic/superhydrophobic fog collector was obtained. By tuning the mesh numbers (40\u2013100) and inclined angles (15\u201390\u00b0), water collection rate of the as-prepared samples reached approximately 200 mg cm\u22122 h\u22121. The process of water collection was shown in Fig. 64d, water microdroplets were firstly captured on the hydrophilic copper sheet, then grew larger than the pore size of the superhydrophobic copper mesh, and subsequently rolled off the modified copper mesh. Additionally, the as-prepared water collectors were durable and could retain a water CA of above 150\u00b0 and a water collection rate of ~ 200 mg cm\u22122 h\u22121 after being immersed in corrosive solutions (such as 1 M HCl, 1 M NaOH and 10 wt% NaCl solution) for 2 hours."

            "text": "Undesired liquids mixing, such as continuous discharge of industrial wastewater and domestic sewage, and frequent occurrence of marine oil spillage, poses huge threats to the environment, resources, public health and the economy.627 For example, according to the statistics by the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation (ITOPF), there were 181 oil spills of 7 tons and over in the 2000s, resulting in 196,000 tons of oil lost.628 The Deepwater Horizon accident in 2010 spurted > 50,000 tons of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico, which contaminated approximately 5,000 square kilometers of area, killed millions of seabirds and lost hundreds of billions of dollars. Therefore, it is of great significance to remediate these contaminated liquid resources.\nFlocculant,629 Fenton catalytic decomposition,630 and physical separation498,631 are several typical methods for remediation of mixed immiscible liquids. Among them, physical separation could simultaneously separate and recycle immiscible liquids with little negative environmental impact, enabling this method to be the most promising one. Porous particles, two-dimensional (2D) filters (e.g., metallic meshes, fabrics or membranes) and three-dimensional (3D) monoliths (e.g., sponges, carbon aerogels) are the three most commonly used substrates; however, some of these traditional filters and adsorbents have low separation efficiency, liquid selectivity and reusability.25,632,633\nTo separate immiscible liquids with a high separation efficiency, a filter or adsorbent is expected to be preferentially wetted by oil and repel water, or vice versa. Superhydrophobic-(super)oleophilic filters are usually applied for separation of immiscible liquids due to their selective wettability of water and oil/organic solvents. In terms of other types of liquid-repellent surfaces, e.g., superamphiphobic surface\nand SLIS, they repel both water and oil/organic solvents and are not very applicable in the separation of immiscible liquids. In this section, superhydrophobic-(super)oleophilic materials will be discussed for immiscible liquids separation, in the forms of particles, 2D filters and 3D monoliths."

            "text": "Superhydrophobic and oleophilic powder adsorbents can be effectively applied to remove large-scale oil spills, especially for the treatment of a thin oil film (0.04\u201350 \u00b5m of thickness) that is floating on the water surface.634 When oil is spilled on sea water, it is easy to manipulate powder-formed oil adsorbents, which only need to be sprinkled on the region of the oil spill. The adsorption process is spontaneous with the aid of waves and tides. To design a high-performance particle adsorbent, three factors are taken into consideration, i.e., surface chemical properties, porosity and the price of raw materials, which may directly affect their selectivity, oil adsorption capacities and extensively practical usage.\nDolomite and calcium carbonate are high-efficiency mineral oil adsorbents because of their low cost, high specific surface area, and ready availability.635,636 However, pristine minerals can be wetted by oils and water at the same time, and thus find it difficult to separate oil and water. It is necessary to modify surface properties to obtain hydrophobicity and oleophilicity. For example, Shen et al. prepared powder-formed superhydrophobic and oleophilic calcium carbonate adsorbents for oil spill clean-ups.635 After coating with a layer of hydrophobic fatty acid molecules, porous calcium carbonate particles were transformed from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. This approach created low-surface-energy and rough surface simultaneously, and provided superhydrophobic and oleophilic properties of calcium carbonate particles. The water CA of modified calcium carbonate particles was 152\u00b0. As a result, these powders floated on water surface and adsorbed oil contaminants autonomously. By quantitative study of calcium carbonate\u2019s oil adsorption performance under different ratios of oil and water, the removal efficiencies towards crude oil and diesel oil from water were all greater than 98%.\nConventional particle-typed oil adsorbents are easy to use; they can be simply spread and dispersed onto the spilled oil layer. However, these particles are very difficult to recycle after adsorbing spilled oil. Hydrophobic and oleophilic particulate adsorbents are combined with magnetic particles to fabricate highly efficient magnetic oil adsorbents, such as TiO2 nanotubes, porous carbon and SiO2 powders etc., which can be easily re-collected and separated by a magnetic separation process.637-639 For example, Pathak et al. fabricated magnetic controllable superhydrophobic and oleophilic TiO2 nanotubes for selective oil removal from water surface.640 The magnetic TiO2 nanotubes were fabricated via a hydrothermal method by using magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4) and TiO2 nanotubes, and were subsequently post-modified with hydrophobic octadecylamine. The as-prepared TiO2 nanotubes had a water CA of 166 \u00b1 1\u00b0 and could adsorb oil from water with a maximum adsorption capacity of 1.5 times of their own weight, and could be separated under an external magnetic force. However, bare Fe3O4 nanoparticles tend to be instable under acid conditions. Developing core-shell magnetic materials may be a good strategy to improve Fe3O4 stability under a harsh environment. For example, superhydrophobic core-shell Fe2O3@C nanoparticles were synthesized for fast and selective adsorption of oils from\nwater.638 The Fe2O3@C nanoparticles were prepared after thermal decomposition of ferric benzoate precursor at 600 \u00b0C for 6 h, followed by coating with hydrophobic vinyl trimethoxysilane (Fig. 65a), endowing the as-synthesized Fe2O3@C nanoparticles with water CA of 162.9 \u00b1 2\u00b0. The porous Fe2O3@C nanoparticles could selectively adsorb various oils with the capacity up to 3.8 times of their own weight while completely repelling water. After adsorption, magnetic materials along with oils could be separated by a magnet bar (Fig. 65b). In addition, Fe2O3@C nanoparticles exhibited outstanding chemical stability and retained water CA of > 150\u00b0 under 0.1 M NaCl and solutions with pH ranging from 3 to 14. Jiang et al. reported vinyl trimethoxysilane-modified magnetic SiO2 particles with core-shell structure for oil removal.639 When the adsorption process was completed, magnetic SiO2 particles could be removed by a magnetic bar, and the adsorption capacity of the resultant SiO2 powders was 7.2 times of their own weight.\nSuperhydrophobic and oleophilic particle adsorbents are fabricated via a simple dip-coating method. Modified particulate oil adsorbents have a great potential to remove thin oil film in situ over a large scale, but their separation and secondary pollutants may hinder their further applications. Particulate oil adsorbents functionalized with magnetic materials may be promising in future applications, however, there are two challenges remaining to be overcome: (1) magnetic materials are unstable under acid conditions and (2) the adsorption performance of magnetic materials towards oils is still unsatisfactory. Therefore, developing highly efficient and stable magnetic oil adsorbents may be an important research direction in the future."

            "text": "Owing to their remarkable operability, excellent separation efficiency and high filtering flux, 2D filters (e.g., stainless steel meshes, textiles and artificially prepared electrospun films) with selective liquid repellence are highly desirable in the separation of pre-collectable immiscible liquids. To evaluate the separation capacity of these 2D liquid-repellent filters, separation efficiency and filtering flux are always\ncharacterised. Separation efficiency (%) indicates the mass (or content) percentage of the separated liquid to that in the original mixtures, and filtering flux (L m\u22122 h\u22121) means the average flow rate of the filtered liquid running through the filter during separation.\nStainless steel meshes are extensively used as substrates for selective oil/water separation owing to their high filtration flux, excellent mechanical strength and mass production.641 For example, Zhang et al. utilized etching and in situ growth method to prepare superhydrophobic zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-L) coated meshes for oil/water separation.642 The stainless steel meshes were firstly etched by HCl for one hour followed by immersion in the precursor solutions of ZIF-L. Then a layer of hydrophobic ZIF-L with dagger-like structure was grown in situ on the surfaces of the meshes (Fig. 66a). The resulting meshes exhibited water CA of 155.4 \u00b1 1.8\u00b0, and achieved isooctane flux of 1.75 \u00d7 105 L m\u22122 h\u22121 and separation efficiency of 99.7%. The hydrophobic modified meshes with long-term water resistance and stability possessed water CAs of above 150\u00b0. Moreover, the modified meshes displayed outstanding antibacterial performance, reducing the opportunity of the hydrophobic layer being destroyed by bacteria due to the existence of Zn ions and 2-methimidazole (Hmim). Li et al. reported superhydrophobic hybrid meshes with high stability under conditions of hot water and strong corrosive solutions through a spray-coating method (Fig. 66b).643 The robust superhydrophobic meshes with water CA of 160 \u00b1 1\u00b0 were fabricated via sequential deposition of candle soot and SiO2 particles. The modified stainless mesh could be made into a small box and put on a beaker. The kerosene could selectively permeate through the box and be collected into the beaker with the separation efficiency of higher than 99.0%. Furthermore, the as-prepared meshes were chemically stable and possessed robust hydrophobicity, showing water CA of above 150\u00b0 under harsh conditions, for example, strong acidic, alkaline, salty solutions, and even hot water.\nCommercial textiles, such as, cotton textiles and polymer-based textiles, are widely reported as porous substrates for oil/water separation.631,644 For example, Zhou et al. used cyclic self-assembly and dip-coating method to synthesize superhydrophobic cotton fabrics for oil/water separation.645 Phytic acid (PA) molecules were firmly anchored on cotton fabrics via covalent bonds and then coordinated with metal ions to create hierarchical micro/nanostructures on the fabrics. Subsequently, intermediate fabrics were hydrophobically modified via PDMS, the resulting fabrics with water CAs of 152.9 \u00b1 1.8\u00b0 were obtained after 8 cycles of self-assembly (Fig. 66c). The separation efficiencies of hydrophobic fabric for all tested oils were above 95%. After 30 cycles of abrasion tests and 300-cycle peeling tests, the water CAs of as-prepared fabric were 142.5 \u00b1 2.5\u00b0 and above 150\u00b0, respectively, retaining excellent hydrophobicity. In addition, superhydrophobicity of the modified fabrics exhibited no obvious change under UV radiation, high temperature and chemical solvents. The robustness of the resulting meshes was attributed to covalent bonds between the polymer and hydroxyl groups of the fabric. Zhou et al. modified cotton fabric with a hydrophobic layer comprising of FeCl3/1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (PTES) and polyaniline (PANI) micro/nanoparticles through a vapor phase deposition method (Fig. 66d).646 A piece of cotton fabric was firstly coated with a layer of FeCl3 and PTES. Subsequently,\nmicro/nanoscale PANI granules were prepared onto the fabric surface by placing intermediates in a chamber filled with aniline via polymerization. Low-surface-energy material PTES molecules were linked with PANI granules via hydrogen bonding. When superhydrophobic fabrics were attacked by acidic and alkaline liquids, or damaged by abrasion and scratch, they still maintained microstructure and surface chemical compositions of the fabric. Under high humidity and temperature, they also kept highly hydrophobicity. After long-term separation, hierarchical nanostructures on the fabric surface were mostly retained. These remarkable performances of modified fabrics may be ascribed to hydrogen bonding between PANI and PTES. Additionally, the hydrophobic fabrics achieved separation efficiency of as high as 97.8%. In addition to stainless steel meshes and cotton fabrics, electrospun films as porous substrates have been studied in the past few decades. Zhang et al. prepared polyimide (PI) electrospun hybrid films with hydrophobicity.647 The PI films were dipped in PDMS solutions and then decorated with ZnO particles via a hydrothermal reaction for 5 h at 110 \u00b0C, the hydrophobic hybrid films were prepared. The separation efficiencies towards oils or organic solvents were all above 90%. After exposure to different damages, such as acidic and alkaline solvents, high temperatures and chemical corrosion, the water CA of modified films remained unchanged. Additionally, the PI hybrid films were resistant to UV radiation for 24 h due to the presence of ZnO particles.\nPA molecules and subsequent PDMS modification.

(1) Selection of a suitable substrates. It is known that fabric and electrospun films are easy to be modified hydrophobically due to their functional surface groups, but they may suffer from weak mechanical performance. Stainless steel meshes possessed excellent mechanical performance, but they can be easily damaged or corroded when used in acidic or salty solutions. Each substrate has advantages and disadvantages and needs different modification methods, they need to be balanced before use. (2) The combination modes between hydrophobic coatings and substrates, e.g., chemical bonding is usually superior compared with interparticle interactions, and enables more robust hydrophobic coatings and further improves the lifespan of filters, especially in harsh environments.

            "text": "The oil/water separation by 2D filters always need external driving forces (e.g., gravity or pressure), making these materials unadoptable to remove large-scale oil spills on water surface. Clean-up of oil spills by 3D adsorbents may be a promising method and has received more attention in terms of in situ removal of spilled oil.25,648,649 Adsorption capacity (g g\u22121), which is defined as the mass ratio of the adsorbed oil and the adsorbent itself, can be used to assess the oil removal capacity of the 3D adsorbent. Compared with particulate adsorbents, 3D adsorbents show higher adsorption capacity, higher adsorption rate and easier recyclability.\nCommercially available polymeric sponges or foams, such as polyurethane sponge and melamine sponge, have been widely used as ideal 3D porous substrates for the preparation of oil adsorbents because of their light weight, high adsorption capacity, as well as excellent recyclability and elasticity.650 However, amphiphilic polyurethane sponges or melamine sponges are not suitable for oils adsorption due to the lack of selectivity towards oils and water. There are two effective ways to modify polymeric sponges or foams transforming from amphiphilicity to hydrophobicity. The first approach is to improve surface polarity via chemical reactions, i.e., surface polarity of chemical groups is proportional to surface energy. Polyurethane or melamine sponges possess abundant polar groups, such as amine and triazine groups, which could bond with modifying agents or metal ions to endow polyurethane or melamine sponge hydrophobicity.651 For example, Ding et al. developed metal ions-induced highly hydrophobic melamine sponges for oil adsorption via a dip-coating method.651 The mechanism of melamine sponges transforming from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity was that N atoms of amine and triazine groups were\ncoordinated with metal ions (including FeIII, ZnII, CoII and NiII) (Fig. 67a). The reduction of polar groups led to hydrophobicity of pure melamine foams. Therefore, as-synthesized sponges could selectively adsorb oil and repel water, and the adsorption capacity were 71\u2013157 g g\u22121. The resultant oil adsorbents kept robust after mechanical squeezing, and also showed remarkable resistance to flame. Pham et al. synthesized superhydrophobic melamine sponges with low-surface-energy material octadecyltrichlorosilane. The melamine sponges were contacted with hydrophobic modifying agent through (i) direct hydrogen bonding between secondary amine groups and silanol, and (ii) hydrogen bonding produced between amine groups and oligomers formed by condensation of the Si-OH (Fig. 67b).652 After that, sponges turned from amphiphilicity into superhydrophobicity and showed water CA of 151.0 \u00b1 1.1\u00b0. The as-prepared sponges could selectively adsorb oil or organic solvents and achieved the adsorption capacities of 82\u2013163 g g\u22121. Owing to the existence of hydrogen bonding, the hydrophobicity of modified sponges remained unchanged after repeated cycles of squeezing.\nThe second strategy is the construction of superhydrophobic nanomaterials onto the skeleton surfaces of sponges or foams, such as metal organic frameworks, graphene oxide or other nanoparticles that are post-modified by hydrophobic agents. For example, Gu et al. prepared robust superhydrophobic wrinkled microspheres-coated polyurethane sponges for efficient oil/water separation via a dip-coating method (Fig. 67c).181 When a piece of polyurethane sponge used as a substrate was dipped in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-8)@reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and polydimethylsiloxane suspension, superhydrophobic ZIF-8@rGO microspheres-coated polyurethane sponge was fabricated. The as-prepared polyurethane sponges with water CA of 171\u00b0 could remove oil from water selectively and achieved a high adsorption capacity of 14\u201329 g g\u22121 towards various oils and organic solvents. Robust sponges could retain excellent superhydrophobicity after repeated squeezing due to the firm adhesion of microspheres onto the interlaced branches of the sponge. Zhu et al. prepared hydrophobic ZIF-8-coated melamine sponges through an in situ growth reaction (Fig. 67d).653 After a melamine sponge was immersed into the precursor solution of ZIF-8, sponge skeletons were completely covered with a layer of hydrophobic ZIF-8 nanoparticles, which improved chemical composition and roughness of the surfaces simultaneously. The thin wettable layer was robust and stable, and kept intact even after over ten cycles of compressive tests. In addition, the adsorption capacities of the resultant sponge were 74\u2013145 g g\u22121. Zhu et al. immersed a sponge into graphene oxide nanosheets solution, followed by chemical reduction of graphene oxide into rGO though a hydrothermal reaction (Fig. 67e).654 Hydrophobic rGO nanosheets were anchored firmly on the sponge\u2019s skeleton via the van der Waals force, which created hierarchical roughness and lowered surface energy on surface of the sponge. The resulting sponges displayed a water CA of 151.4\u00b0 and selectively adsorbed oils from water, with the adsorption capacity of 60\u2013140 g g\u22121. After 50 cycles of adsorption-squeezing process, adsorption efficiency did not decline significantly. Besides, the rGO-modified sponges possessed outstanding flame-retardant property. Zhu et al. fabricated polysiloxane-coated polyurethane sponges using methyltrichlorosilane though a one-step immersion method (Fig. 67f).655 Polysiloxane was formed after the hydrolysis of methyltrichlorosilane, and was anchored firmly on the sponges\u2019 surface, leading to hierarchical surface roughness and low surface energy. The adsorption capacity of the obtained superhydrophobic adsorbents were 15\u201325 g g\u22121. The superhydrophobic sponges exhibited remarkable chemical and thermal stability, and had a water CA of > 150\u00b0 after immersing in strong acid or alkali solution and even exposed to a temperature range of 30\u201390 \u00b0C. In addition, superhydrophobicity and elasticity of the modified sponges showed no decline even after 300 consecutive compressions, possessing excellent mechanical stability.\nCarbon-based materials with super water repellence are also one of the most used oil adsorbents. For example, Chen et al. prepared superhydrophobic poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-based foams by using table salt as a sacrificial template.72 As shown in Fig. 68a, PVDF, multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and table salt were mixed together and then heated at the temperature of 200 \u00b0C for 30 min. After cooling and dissolution of the table salt, the porous superhydrophobic PVDF-MWCNT foams with water CAs of 152.6 \u00b1 4.5\u00b0 were obtained. The foams possessed adsorption capacities of 3\u201312 g g\u22121 to oils or organic\nsolvents with different densities. Besides, the foams were highly resistant towards UV radiation, corrosive solutions, and turbulent conditions. Xia et al. synthesized carbon-based porous foam consisting of carbon-nanosheet (CNS) frameworks and iron/iron carbide (Fe/Fe3C) nanoparticles via ferric nitrate assisted chemical blowing and carbonization of polyvinylpyrrolidone, and finally obtained superhydrophobic and magnetic CNS-based foam after PDMS treatment (Fig. 68b).656 The foam showed low density, extremely high compressive strength, and selective oil cleanup ability with oil adsorption capacity of 5\u201327 g g\u22121. The foam could remove oil selectively from water in non-open channels under magnet assistance due to its paramagnetic property, and could be easily recovered by heating or releasing in other solvents with stable adsorption capacity. The chemically stable CNS frameworks and PDMS coating enabled the foam to be durable towards high/low temperature and corrosive solutions (e.g., 1 M NaOH and saturated NaCl solution). The 3D porous and self-similar micro structures of the foam enabled it to be mechanical abrasion resistant so as to retain its super water repellence and oil adsorption capacity after repeated and intensive abrasion by sandpaper. Compared with carbon-based sponges and foams, porous carbon aerogels derived from biomass show outstanding features of low density, high porosity, fire-resistance and chemical stability.25,657,658 Wu et al. reported an ultralight, flexible, fire-resistant, and superhydrophobic carbon nanofiber aerogels for oils adsorption by pyrolyzing bacterial cellulose pellicles.659 High porosity of carbon aerogel was beneficial for oil adsorption and its adsorption capacities for oily liquids were up to 106\u2013312 g g\u22121. In addition, it had an excellent fire-resistant property when being exposed to flame, enabling the recycling of carbon aerogels for oil adsorption by a direct combustion method. Besides these carbonized aerogel derived from biomass, hydrophobized nanocellulose-based materials have also been widely used as oil sorbents due to their abundant and sustainable resources, natural renewability, excellent biodegradability and mechanical properties.660,661 Phanthong et al. fabricated a nanocellulose sponge via freeze-drying of nanocellulose aqueous suspension and following hydrophobic treatment with stearoyl chloride at 50 \u00b0C for 1 h.662 The obtained porous nanocellulose sponge showed superhydrophobicity (water CA 160 \u00b0) and superoleophilicity, which enabled the sponge to selectively adsorb oils from water surface with absorption capacities of 25\u201355 g g\u22121. The nanocellulose sponge could be easily recovered by squeezing, so it could be reused for selective oil removal at least 10 cycles with high separation efficiency. Shang et al. prepared a cross-linked nanocellulose aerogel through the freeze-drying of cellulose nanofibril (CNF) and 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA) and subsequent esterification at high temperature (170 \u00b0C), which became superhydrophobic and superoleophilic after being modified by CVD of hexadecyltrimethoxysilane (HTMS) (Fig. 68c).663 Ultra-low density (6.05 mg cm\u22123) and high porosity (99.61%) enabled the aerogel to adsorb various oily liquids with adsorption capacity of 77\u2013226 g g\u22121. The chemical cross-linking reaction greatly enhanced the structural and thermal stability of the resultant aerogel, as well as the reusability towards repeated oil adsorption.\n3D monoliths could selectively in situ adsorb oils, possess high adsorption capacity, and could be easily regenerated by squeezing or combustion after adsorption. However, it is ineffective for adsorbents to\nremove crude oils with high viscosity because the infusion of crude oils into porous structures is relatively slow compared with light oils. During desorption, porous structure and hydrophobic coatings may be damaged by consecutive squeezing and combustion, and thus selectivity and adsorption capacities are directly influenced. Besides, when adsorbents were affected by external harsh surroundings, such as wave or heavy rain, oils may be desorbed from the adsorbents.\nOil adsorbents, namely particulate adsorbents and 3D monoliths, exhibit some excellent features of in situ oil removal, easy operation and spontaneous adsorption. It was challenging to collect used adsorbents that spread over wide ocean surface in severe ocean weather, even though they possess magnetism and millimeter size. Furthermore, the complicated regeneration process and limited adsorption capacity may hinder further practical applications of powder-formed adsorbents. In some cases, the combination of\nparticles and 3D monoliths may be an effective approach to adsorb oils from sea surface. 3D monoliths are applied to remove a large amount of oil and then particle adsorbents are used to remove thin residual oil layer. Super liquid-repellent 2D filters are capable of selective oils or organic solvents separation with high efficiency and continuous operation, but their usage may be impeded for separation of heavy oils (e.g., tetrachloromethane). The cleaning and disposal of used filters is a great challenge because the eluting agents may be environmentally unfriendly and even damage the micro/nano structures required by liquid repellence. All oils adsorbents and filter materials face the problem of durability and stability in harsh environments, such as high temperature, corrosive solutions, UV exposure, mechanical disruption and turbulent surroundings. In short, lots of challenges need to be overcome for the design of next-generation adsorbents and filters with liquid repellence."

            "text": "The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), firstly introduced by Wang\u2019s group, is based on combined effects of contact electrification and electrostatic induction.664 Recently, droplet based-TENGs have received extensive research interest because they could effectively convert low-frequency motion of water into electric energy, and the usage of the liquid itself as the triboelectric material overcomes the inevitable friction wear between two solid materials.36,37,665-667 In this section, droplet based-TENGs with different types of interfaces are divided into liquid-solid TENG and liquid-liquid TENG.36 For liquid-solid TENG, it is classified into single electrode mode and freestanding mode according to the numbers of electrodes.668\nLiquid-solid TENG. Liquid-solid TENGs with liquid-repellent solid surfaces can timely shed droplets from the surface without forming liquid film even at high impact frequency, resulting in enhanced electrical output.669 Cho et al. fabricated superhydrophobic TENGs with different surface structures (nanostructures and hierarchical structures) and investigated the effect of two types of morphologies towards electric output performance.670 The as-prepared TENGs were composed of nanostructured and hierarchically structured Al(OH)3, which were etched on aluminum using alkali or acid etching method and superhydrophobic treatment (heptadecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrodecyl-trichlorosilane). As a result, a droplet of water impacting on the hierarchically structured surface rebounded from the surface while the water droplet tended to adhere on the nanostructured surface. The effect of water droplet release height and remaining water on both surfaces on energy harvesting were compared. When water droplets were sequentially released on two surfaces at the height of 1 cm, the output voltage from the nanostructured surface greatly decreased, but the voltage from hierarchically structured surface only slightly fluctuated.\nBesides, it was easy for a thin water layer to generate on nanostructured superhydrophobic surfaces due to the disappearance of the air cushion. Therefore, the output voltage significantly reduced and then towards no electric output when the impact velocity of water droplets was low. However, in terms of superhydrophobic surfaces with hierarchical structures, water droplets at high impact velocity were split into different sizes, large droplets rebounded while small droplets got pinned on the hierarchically structured surface. Therefore, the energy harvesting performance was decreased. When another water droplet coalesced with the remaining small droplets, an improvement of output voltage resulted. In addition, superhydrophobic surfaces with hierarchical structures showed excellent resistance to low surface tension liquids and highly viscous liquids, and could generate stable output voltage as well. Differing from traditional TENGs whose electrodes were underlying dielectric layers, Zhang et al. synthesized single electrode droplet-based electricity generator (DEG), in which the Al electrode was arranged on the top of different artificial and natural dielectric materials, such as PTFE, silicon, aloe, cicada wing, stone, wood, paper and glass (Fig. 69a).665 Among these surfaces, stone, wood, paper and glass were pre-modified via commercial hydrophobic spray (NeverWet). All the as-mentioned surfaces were demonstrated to be hydrophobic, leading to the rapid refreshment of liquid-solid surfaces after continuous water droplets impinging. When a water droplet impacted the solid surface and then spread to contact the Al electrode, the solid material and Al electrode was connected, and thus there was an electric output between Al electrode and ground. After the water droplet left the solid surface, the output disappeared. The as-prepared electricity generators can drive a calculator or store energy when PTFE or aloe/stone were selected as solid materials, respectively. Besides, the resulted electricity generator could be arranged on any surfaces to harvest kinetic energy of water droplets and then convert into electricity power. Recently, Zhao et al. proposed an oil-solid TENG by pasting an Al electrode with 80-\u03bcm-thick polyimide or PTFE films, which were then coated with a superamphiphobic SiO2 layer. 671 The superamphiphobic SiO2 coating was prepared by depositing 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane on anionic fluorocarbon surfactant modified SiO2 nanoparticles. Based on the contact and separation between oils and solid surfaces, the as-prepared oil-solid TENG generated an excellent electric output with an open-circuit voltage of 22.5 V, a short-circuit current of 50 nA, a charge density of 9.1 \u03bcC m\u22122 and a power density of 1.23 mW m\u22122, which was an order of magnitude higher than that of oil-solid TENGs made from commercial dielectric materials. In addition, the TENG showed excellent durability and retained 90% of the initial electrical output even after 30000 cycles.\nIn addition to single-electrode mode, Zhao et al. reported a freestanding mode TENGs with two electrodes under the dielectric layer.672 A pair of silver electrodes with 5 mm interval were placed between the Nylon and PTFE, where Nylon was used as a support and PTFE worked as a dielectric material. The resulting freestanding mode TENGs were prepared after the intermediate was sealed by PDMS solution. The generation of electric output from freestanding TENGs relied on effective contact area, which was determined by the water spreading and shrinking on the PTFE surface. When installed on an umbrella, the as-prepared TENGs could generate the maximum power density of 1.838 W m\u22122 and light up ~ 30\nlight-emitting diodes (LEDs) instantaneously. Hu et al. developed superhydrophobic TENGs, which consisted of a superhydrophobic layer and several Cu electrodes, for biomedical applications.673 The resultant TENGs were fabricated after Cu electrodes with double-sided adhesive tapes were coated with hydrophobic fumed silicon via a dip-coating method (Fig. 69b). The TENGs exhibited excellent repellency towards various liquids with CAs of near 160\u00b0 to droplets of HCl, NaOH, water, blood, urine and phosphate buffer. A water droplet impacted the superhydrophobic TENG, due to contact electrification, the water droplet and the solid surface were positively charged and negatively charged, respectively. As shown in Fig. 69c, when the as-prepared TENG was tilted at 20\u00b0, a water droplet with positive charges touched the superhydrophobic surface, the first electrode exhibited negative charge, the other electrode displayed positive charge, and thus a pulsed current was generated. When a droplet of water contacted solid surface above the second Cu electrode, this electrode was negatively charged, while the other was positively charged. These two obtained pulsed currents were opposite. The superhydrophobic liquid-solid TENGs can be used for medical application as droplet sensors via detecting the signal of pulsed currents. In addition, the device was robust due to the existence of sticky force between superhydrophobic fumed silicon particles and double-sided tapes. Recently, Zhang et al. proposed an efficient raindrop energy-based TENG by using a superhydrophobic polyethylene (PE) film as a negative triboelectric layer material.674 As depicted in Fig. 69d, the outer surface of the PE film was firstly functionalized by plasma to gain superhydrophobicity and then a thin copper upper electrode was attached on, while the inner surface of the film was spin-coated with a thin layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and was used as a lower electrode. Owing to electrostatic induction, at initial impacting stage between water droplet and the film surface, equal negative charges and positive charges were respectively generated on the film and lower electrode, and no current formed between the lower and upper electrodes. As the droplet spread and contacted with the upper electrode, the film acquired more electrons based on liquid-solid contact electrification, and electrostatically induced positive charges on the lower electrode were transferred to the upper electrode, which resulted in an electrical output. When the water droplet completely spread on the upper electrode, the two electrodes and PE film were connected to form a closed-loop electrical system, enabling the generation of triboelectric charges through the bulk effect between the lower/upper electrode and the film rather than through the traditional interfacial electrostatic induction between the lower electrode and the film. The interfacial screening effect was consequently avoided, and effective triboelectric charge transfer was thus realized. After the droplet rolled off from the film, the charges moved back from the upper electrode to the lower electrode, and the cyclic electricity generation process could thereby be realized by another water droplet impact. When the dripping frequency and height of simulated rain droplets were respectively set to 2 Hz and 15 cm, a 10 \u03bcF capacitor was charged to ~ 6 V after 3 min continuous droplets dripping, which could be used to drive a timer for ~ 12 s. Based on the same working mechanism, Chen et al. reported another droplet-based TENG by using laser-induced graphene (LIG) electrodes.675 By using interfacial laser processing method, the TENG was constructed by in situ growth of fluorine-doped LIG (F-LIG) and LIG electrodes on the top and bottom sides of\nfluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP)-coated polyimide (PI) film, and the working mechanism of the assembled F-LIG-based TENG is illustrated in Fig. 69e. After water droplet impacted the FEP surface, charge accumulation at the LIG electrode occurred due to electrostatic induction. When the droplet spread and contacted with the F-LIG electrode, a closed-loop circuit was formed, which triggered rapid charges transfer from the LIG to F-LIG electrodes, leading to a large instantaneous electric power of ~ 53.2 mW due to the extremely short contact duration between the droplet and superhydrophobic F-LIG. The TENG showed high power conversion efficiency, generating a peak power of 15.2 mW with the power density of 47.5 W m\u22122 during the impacting and sliding of a water droplet with volume of 105 \u03bcL from a height of 25 cm. Moreover, the TENG possessed superior operational stability under various harsh conditions, maintaining 88% of the peak power at a high humidity level of 96%, 70% of the peak power density after 10000 cycles testing, and functioning well in aqueous solutions with pH values of 3\u201313.\npermission from ref. 674.

Superhydrophobic TENGs reduced the effective contact area between liquid and solid surfaces, compromising energy conversion efficiency.676 Besides, it is unsuitable for superhydrophobic TENGs to be applied in high humid surroundings and freezing temperature due to the disappearance of the air cushion, followed by the formation of unwanted wetting transition. As a result, charge generation and transport were screened, and the efficiency of energy harvesting was reduced.677 Xu el al. reported a robust SLIS-based triboelectric nanogenerator and demonstrated charge generation primarily were from the triboelectricity between water and SLIS interface.676 The as-prepared SLIS-TENG constituted indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes and a perfluorinated liquid-infused porous PTFE layer (Fig. 70a). At a temperature of below 5 \u00b0C, water droplet could easily slide off the SLIS-TENG, but the water droplet was pinned on the superhydrophobic surfaces (i.e., SHS-TENG or PTFE-TENG) (Fig. 70b). The SLIS-TENG retained stable output power of 200 nW and could light up bulbs in both room and freezing temperature (\u22123 \u00b0C). However, bulbs could not be lit up on the superhydrophobic surface at \u22123 \u00b0C (Fig. 70c). It is because the formation of ice/frost was delayed or suppressed on SILS-TENG, promoting droplet mobility on its surface and energy generation. However, there were ice crystals formed on PTFE-TENG owing to the disappearance of air pocket, preventing charge separation in the process of triboelectricity. In addition, the effect of scratches on energy generation performance of SLIS-TENG was negligible because of the self-healing property of SLISs. The SLIS-TENG was demonstrated to be robust and durable after 10,000 consecutive water droplets impact, with only 0.4% of lubricant loss.\nSHS-TENG at \u22123 \u00b0C.

Falling water droplets impacted the upper part and rebounded from the superhydrophobic surface, during which the glycerin droplets sandwiched between two superhydrophobic surfaces were compressed to semi-Cassie state and then recovered to Cassie state. The deformation and recovery of the glycerin droplets changed the distance between the coil and the magnetic base, which changed the magnetic flux through the coil and thereby generated electricity. Multiple bouncing of the water droplet on the superhydrophobic surface enabled the magnetic flux passing through the coil to increase/decrease periodically, which resulted in a damping electric performance. When a 50 \u03bcL water droplet was released from a height of 10 cm, the first impacting generated electricity with peak power of 23.8 \u03bcW. Afterwards, they developed another superhydrophobic surface-based electricity generator by using water-based ferromagnetic liquid droplet sliding induced magnetic flux change (Fig. 71b).679 As illustrated in Fig. 71c, upon tilting the superhydrophobic substrate, the ferromagnetic liquid droplet containing randomly distributed Fe3O4 nanoparticles started sliding on the surface and moved onto the magnetic field area, after which the nanoparticles were magnetized and thereby changed the magnetic flux passing through the conductive coil, allowing electricity generation in the coil. After the ferromagnetic liquid droplet rolled away from the magnetic field area, the magnetic flux recovered and electricity generated in the coil again. When a 100 \u03bcL ferromagnetic liquid droplet slid on the surface (tilting speed of 9.5\u00b0 s\u22121) under a 13 mT magnetic field, an electrical response with output power of 2.1 nW were recorded. Similarly, electricity generation under water by using oily magnetic nanofluid droplet sliding on underwater superoleophobic surface has also been reported.680"

            "text": "With the rapid development of high-power electronic devices such as microprocessors, radars and advanced lasers, highly efficient heat dissipation and cooling by enhanced heat transfer is becoming increasingly important.681-684 As a useful and efficient process to transfer energy, liquid-vapor phase change (e.g., boiling and condensation) heat transfer has drawn great research interest in recent years, and critical heat flux (CHF) and heat transfer coefficient (HTC) are always employed to evaluate its heat transfer performance.33-35,685-691 CHF is the maximum heat flux, beyond which a much less effective filmwise heat transfer or even a boiling crisis develops, and HTC is defined as the heat flux divided by the temperature difference (\u0394T) between the surface and the bulk fluid (i.e., superheat for boiling and supercooling for condensation). The liquid-vapor phase-change heat transfer involves recurrent nucleation, growth, coalescence, and departure of a new phase (that is, bubbles for boiling and droplets for condensation),33-35,692 which is highly dependent on the wettability of the surface.74,692-696 For boiling heat\ntransfer, hydrophobicity promotes the nucleation, whereas hydrophilicity is preferred for the growth and departure of bubbles.34,689 Meanwhile, hydrophilicity can also favor rapid liquid re-wetting of the surface during boiling, which restrains the formation of a vapor blanket between the surface and bulk liquid at high superheat, thereby delaying the boiling crisis that leads to significant increase of the surface temperature.34,689 It is well verified that (super)hydrophobic surfaces offer better nucleate boiling heat transfer than hydrophilic surfaces at low superheat due to the siginificantly increased active nucleation site density, but their performance deteriorate sharply and become worse than hydrophilic surfaces at high superheat, as the high superheat results in high-density vapour bubbles which coalesce rapidly and form a relatively insulated evaporating vapor blanket on the (super)hydrophobic surface acting as a thermal barrier for heat transfer (i.e., film boiling).34,686,689,697-700 To delay the early transition into filmwise boiling and the formation of the insulating vapor layer that greatly decreases heat transfer efficiency, some strategies, such as decorating (super)hydrophobic patterns on (super)hydrophilic surface,686,701-703 and boiling on a superhydrophobic surface in the Wenzel wetting state,704,705 have been proposed to increase the CHF and/or HTC compared with their flat hydrophilic counterparts. Even so, the research on boliling heat transfer mainly focuses on those micro/nano structured (super)hydrophilic surfaces with high wickability rather than (super)hydrophobic surfaces. By contrast, condensation heat transfers on liquid-repellent surfaces (including superhydrophobic surfaces and SLISs) have drawn keen research interest in recent years, and much progress have been achieved.34,35,74,315,446,449,573,687,689,706-716 Therefore, in this section, we emphatically discuss the condensation heat transfer on superhydrophobic surfaces and SLISs.\nHeat transfer behavior of condensation can be described by the typical curve depicted in Fig. 72a where the heat flux (Q) is plotted as a function of surface subcooling (\u0394T).33 When the subcooling is very low, condensation is negligible and the heat is mostly transferred by convection (region A in Fig. 72a). As the subcooling increases continuously, liquid vapor starts to nucleate at the onset of droplet nucleation (ODN), and dropwise condensation mode occurs, which enables a monotonic increase of the heat flux due to the accelerated droplet nucleation, growth, and removal refresh the nucleation sites rapidly, until the maximum value of CHF is obtained (region B in Fig. 72a). Taking superhydrophobic surfaces as examples, Fig. 72b shows their typical dynamic processes of recurrent dropwise condensation, as well as the characteristic diameters at each stage.34 The processes starts from the heterogeneous nucleation of droplets with critical diameters of several nanometers. After continuous condensation and growth, the droplets with diameters in the range of 2\u2013500 \u03bcm coalense with each other, followed which the condensed droplets are removed from the surfaces through either surface energy release-induced jumping (~ 2\u20131000 \u03bcm in diameters) or gravity-driven sliding (1.5\u20132.5 mm in diameters). The removal of condensed droplets effectively refreshes the nucleation sites on the surfaces, which favors the heat transfer efficiency of superhydrophobic surfaces. As shown in the region C of Fig. 72a, further increase of the subcooling leads to too fast nucleation and the condensed droplets cannot shed off from the surface but tend to coalesce into a liquid film, and a transition heat transfer mode with sharply decreased Q occurs. At higher\nsubcoolings, liquid film eventually formed on the surface and results in a filmwise condensation mode that is characterized by relactively low CHF and HTC. Liquid-repellent surfaces with low CAH towards droplets enable rapid removal (via jumping or/and sliding) of the condensed droples and significantly delay the transition to filmwise condensation even at high subcooling, which shows distinct advantages over hydrophilic surfaces with high CAH. Therefore, the droplet condensation heat transfer on liquid-repellent surfaces that functioned in region B (Fig. 72a) is widely explored.\nIt is well-known that nanostructured (either nanostructured alone or micro/nano hierarchical) superhydrophobic surfaces could potentially favor dropwise condensation, while microstructured ones often lead to highly pinned Wenzel droplets during short-term condensation,717,718 making those nanostructured ones more appealing towards dropwise condensation enhanced heat transfer. Typically, when condensation develops on a nanostructured superhydrophobic surface characterizing with high CA and low CAH (i.e., the Cassie-Baxter wetting state), three morphologies (Fig. 73a), including suspended, partially wetting, and pinned droplets, can be observed.711,719-721 Miljkovic et al. demonstrated the critical\neffect of droplet morphology on droplet growth dynamics and heat transfer during condensation on superhydrophobic nanostructured surfaces.706 They fabricated silicon nanopillar surfaces by using e-beam lithography and deep reactive ion etching of silicon wafer, which was then silanated by CVD of (tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl)-1-trichlorosilane to obtain superhydrophobicity. In situ ESEM study showed that both suspended and partially wetting droplets underwent coalescence-induced jumping at identical length scales, but the initial growth rate of the partially wetting droplets was 6 times higher than that of the suspended ones due to the increased contact with the substrate. By using a thermal resistance-based droplet growth model, the authors found that the partially wetting droplets had 4\u20136 times higher heat transfer rates than that of the suspended ones, which was attributed to the siginificant thermal resistance caused by the air \u201ccushion\u201d under the suspended droplets. Furthermore, they showed that compared with a flat hydrophobic silicon surface, the superhydrophobic nanostructured surfaces had 56% heat flux enhancement for the partially wetting droplet morphology but 71% heat flux degradation for the suspended one. By contrast, under increased surface subcooling (heat flux) and/or saturation pressure, reduced nucleation size and increased nucleation site density result in the formation of highly pinned droplets that even develop into flooding condensation, which severely deteriorates the heat transfer efficiency of the surfaces.687,711,722-724 Therefore, ensuring rapid droplet shedding and minimizing the negative effect of the air \u201ccushion\u201d by favoring partially wetting droplet morphology need sufficient consideration when design superhydrophobic surfaces for enhanced heat transfer.\nThe droplet wetting morphologies are highly depedent on the surface properties and condensation conditions. Enright et al. proposed that the local energy barriers was a key to the droplet growth during condensation, and the emergent droplet morphology was influenced by the droplet-droplet interactions\nthat were governed by the nucleation density (i.e., the average spacing between nucleation sites L relative to the structure length scale l, L/l).719 Suspended droplets with Cassie-Baxter state nucleating on the tips of the structures were unconditionally stable in the absence of droplet interactions and gravity. They showed that the droplet morphology was dictated by the intricate liquid/structure interaction dynamics, and it could be roughly estimated by an energy criterion that compared the energies of the non-equilibrium advancing Cassie-Baxter (cos\u03b8adv,C-B = \u22121) and Wenzel (cos\u03b8adv,W = rcos\u03b8adv,flat) states with a dimensionless energy ratio:\nadv,C-B\nadv,W adv,flat\ncos 1 *=\ncos cos E r\n\n \n\u2212 = (32)\nwhere \u03b8adv,flat is the advancing CA of a flat surface. As shown in the regime map depicting the dominant wetting behavior during condensation (Fig. 73b), Wenzel droplet morphologies were favored when E* \u2265 1, while partially wetting Cassie-Baxter droplets formed when E* \u2264 1. Meanwhile, the authors found that\nthe droplet morphology was also influenced by the droplet nucleation density, and when L/l \u2265 2\u20135 and E* \u2264 1, the formation of partial wetting Cassie-Baxter droplets was favored, while when L/l was lower than the critical value, Wenzel droplets formed regardless of the energetically preferred wetting state. Wen\net al. studied the wetting transition of condensed droplets on a nanostructured superhydrophobic surface with tapered nanogaps, and demonstrated that the surface wetting property, topography, and condensing condition played synergistic effect on the wetting state and dynamic behavior of the condensed droplets.721 Copper plate was firstly nanostructured by chemical oxidation and then coated with (1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane layer via CVD, rendering the surface superhydrophobic (Fig. 73c). Results showed that the surface subcooling (\u0394T) had significant effect on the nucleation size and nucleation site density (Fig. 73d). When \u0394T was set to be 0.3 K, condensation started from the nucleation of droplets with large size and the condensed droplets tended to be in the suspended Cassie-Baxter state (Fig. 73e), enabling them to shed off the surface rapidly via spontaneous jumping with a maximum size of less than several tens of micrometers (Fig. 73f). By increasing the surface subcooling, more droplets nucleated on the surface but their critical nucleation size decreased (Fig. 73d), resulting in pining of the condensed droplets or even flooding of the surface. Taking \u0394T = 0.8 K as an example, the nucleated droplets with reduced size could stay at the bottom of the nanogaps and then easily merged within the nanogaps due to the spatial confinement effect (Fig. 73g), leading to the formation of pinned droplets with obviously increased size on the surface (Fig. 73h), and gravity-induced sliding dominated the subsequent shedding of the condensed droplets. These results demonstrated that the transition from suspended Cassie-Baxter and partially wetting states to pinned Wenzel state or even flooding could be effectively suppressed by decreasing the length scale of the surface structures. This was also verified by Seo et al. who showed that improving the nanoscale coating homogeneity and reducing the structure length scale favored effective anti-flooding during condensation on superhydrophobic surfaces and thereby enhanced the long-term heat transfer efficiency.724 They deposited nanoscopically non-uniform and uniform coating by liquid-phase and vapor-phase depositions of 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltrimethoxysilane, respectively. As shown in Fig. 73i, the non-uniform coating consisted of solid-phase agglomerates around which a thin dilute-phase film of disordered molecules located, while the uniform coating had a well-ordered and highly uniform molecular film. Rough CuO structures with different length scales were prepared by chemical immersion methods (Fig. 73j). Relatively large CuO structures had height of ~ 1.0 \u03bcm, pitch of ~ 300 nm, solid fraction of ~ 0.023, roughness factor of ~ 10, while relatively small CuO structures showed height of ~ 200 nm, pitch of ~ 150 nm, solid fraction of ~ 0.020, and roughness factor of ~ 12. Condensation testing results showed that compared to superhydrophobic surface with large CuO structures and non-uniform coating, the one with small structures and uniform coating provided a ~ 130% enhanced average HTC with ~ 14% larger supersaturation range for droplet jumping.\n721.

Copyright (2020) American Chemical Society.\nTo avoid the failure of superhydrophobicity and to delay the transition to flooding during condensation, well-designed closely packed nanostructures that can stabilize the trapped air \u201ccushion\u201d and enhance droplets self-propelled jumping upon coalescence (Fig. 74a, also see Section 4.2.2) are desired for heat transfer enhancement.33-35,51,443,444,446,448,687 For example, Miljkovic et al. prepared nanostructured CuO films on Cu tube surface by chemical oxidation in a hot alkaline solution composed of NaClO2, NaOH, Na3PO4\u00b712H2O, and deionized water (3.75:5:10:100 wt%), which were then functionalized by using CVD of a fluorinated silane (trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane).687 As shown in Fig. 74b, sharp, knife-like CuO nanostructures with heights of ~ 1 \u03bcm, solid fraction of ~ 0.023, and roughness factor of ~ 10 were constructed. Depending on the very efficient removal of the coalesced droplets (radius of ~ 8 \u03bcm) via self-propelled jumping (Fig. 74c and d), a 25% higher overall heat flux and 30% higher HTC were achieved on the nanostructured CuO superhydrophobic surfaces compared with conventional dropwise condensation on smooth Cu surfaces at low supersaturations (< 1.12). However, at high surface subcooling and/or supersaturations, the droplet nucleation density increased sharply and the interactions between droplets occurred on a similar length scale as the spacing among nanostructures (~ 1 \u03bcm), leading to the formation of highly pinned Wenzel droplets rather than the energetically favorable partially wetting Cassie-like droplets, which triggered the transition to flooding condensation (Fig. 74e).\nBy reduceing the permeation of water vapor molecular into the intervals between nanowires on condensing surfaces (Fig. 75a), Wen et al. proposed to enhance their condensation heat transfer even under large surface subcooling (up to 24 K) via controlling droplet nucleation based on spatial confinement effect.710 By using a two-step porous anodic alumina template-assisted electro-deposition method, the authors prepared closely packed copper nanowires on copper substrate with an average diameter of 200\u2013240 nm, a height of 20 \u03bcm, and an average interval of 100\u2013140 nm (Fig. 75b), which were then funationalized by n-octadecanethiol for hydrophobicity. When the surface subcooling was small (\u0394T < 8 K), the condensed droplets were mostly removed by self-propelled jumping (Fig. 75c),710,725 and both heat flux and HTC gained more than 100% enhancement over the dropwise condensation on a flat hydrophobic surface, and the CHF of ~ 136 kW m\u22122 was measured at surface subcoolings of 6 K.710 However, as \u0394T increased to 9 K, the condensed droplets grew rapidly and then merged to be larger, which resulted in droplet sliping and thereby surface refreshing by sweeping (Fig. 75d).725 When \u0394T further increased to 18 K, large condensed droplets with diameters up to > 2 mm sticked on the surface and highly pinned Wenzel droplets were observed (Fig. 75e), which led to the undesired flooding condensation and greatly degraded the heat transfer performance.725 To delay the transition to flooding condensation on such surface with uniform nanowires under large \u0394T, Wen et al. proposed to control the droplet nucleation, growth and departure by using superhydrophobic surface with micropatterned nanowire arrays (Fig. 75f).725 It was found that the jumping droplet condensation could be well maintained when \u0394T was increased from 2 K to 9 K (Fig. 75g and h), and although the sweeping droplet condensation was observed when \u0394T increased to 18 K (Fig. 75i), the flooding condensation was avoided even when their testing \u0394T was up to 28 K. As a result, compared with the uniform nanowired surface, the micropatterned one showed significantly enhanced heat transfer performance in the full tested surface subcooling range of 0\u201328 K, and the CHF was increased by 37% from 136 to 186 kW m\u22122 at \u0394T of 14 K, which also indicated that the region of \u0394T for self-propelled droplet jumping was expanded by 133% from 6 to 14 K. The ehhanced heat transfer was attributed to the combination of the spatial control of nucleation for mobile droplets using the closely packed nanowires (Fig. 75j) and the Laplace pressure-powered spontaneous outward moving of the droplets for rapid removal using micropatterned nanowire arrays (Fig. 75k). Tang et al. prepared a hierarchical micro-nanostructured superhydrophobic surface with tapered micro and nano gaps via electrodeposition and alkaline oxidation.718 Condensation testing showed that the nanostructures enabled jetting of microdroplets via tapered nanogaps induced Laplace pressure and self-propelled jumping of submillimeter droplets upon coalescence, and the tapered microstructures favored to push the pinned droplets out of the microgaps via additional Laplace pressure generated by the tapered microtopology (i.e., dislodging). The subsequent droplets coalescence on top of the microstructures triggered microdroplets navigation before finally shedding off from the surface, which prevented the pinning of the condensed droplets, and thereby delayed flooding and enhanced heat transfer performance. Compared with the superhydrophobic surface with nanostructures alone, the surface with hierarchical micro-nanostructures showed much longer duration for dropwise condensation (3 h vs 10 h),\nand the highest heat flux of 223 \u00b1 9.8 kW\u00b7m\u22122 at \u0394T = 10 K and the maximum HTC of 218 \u00b1 29 kW\u00b7m\u22122\u00b7K\u22121 at \u0394T = 0.2 K were achieved.\nMeanwhile, it was found that during the fabrication of closely packed straight nanowires, they tend to agglomerate due to surface tension, leading to the formation of numerous micro-defects with size of 1\u20133 \u03bcm (Fig. 76a and b).711 The micro-defects showed much smaller energy barrier (~ \u22125.7 \u00d7 10\u221212 J) compared with that required in the intervals between nanowires (~ \u22126 \u00d7 10\u221215 J) for droplet nucleation,\nenabling them to become preferred nucleate sites, which subsequently promote the formation of highly pinned droplets at large surface subcoolings (Fig. 76c).711 To avoid the heat transfer deterioration caused by the agglomeration of straight nanowire arrays, Wen et al. proposed to construct superhydrophobic surface with 3D nanowire networks with interconnections among them.711,726 The authors fabricated 3D porous anodic alumina template by anodizing impure (purity < 99.5%) Al foil, which was then used as a template to prepare 3D copper nanowire networks through a two-step electro-deposition method (Fig. 76d and e). Then a fluorinated silane (trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)-silane) was uniformly deposited to render the resultant surface superhydrophobic. Compared with the straight nanowire arrays, the proposed 3D nanowire networks provided homogeneous surface morphologies without micro-defects, and the interconnections reduced the effective spacing between neighboring nanowires, which enabled spatially controlled nucleation at the top of nanowires for the formation of suspended or partially wetting droplets and thereby enhanced stable droplet jumping even at large surface subcoolings of up to 28 K (Fig. 76f). In addition, the interconnections reduced the effective thermal resistance of the nanowire layer, which favored the heat exchange between the droplets and condensing substrate. As a result, significant enhancement of heat transfer was observed on the superhydrophobic 3D nanowire networks (Fig. 76g and h), and a 100% higher heat transfer flux was obtained at large surface subcooling, for example, heat flux of ~ 280 kW\u00b7m\u22122 was realized when \u0394T = 28 K.\njumping condensation on the 3D superhydrophobic nanowire networks without flooding under large \u0394T of 28 K.

Copyright (2017) Elsevier Inc.\nPatterning superhydrophobic surfaces with wettability contrast (i.e., designing biphilic surfaces) is also demonstrated to be capable of delaying the flooding phenomenon at high surface subcoolings so as to improve their heat transfer performance.34,35,444,446,723,727-730 For example, Hou et al. reported enhanced heat transfer via recurrent filmwise and dropwise condensation on a beetle inspired superhydrophobic surface with hydrophilic patterns.446 They fabricated micro-scale SiO2 patterns on Si wafer using standard photolithography and oxide etching processes, and then obtained micropillars with SiO2 tops by etching using tetramethylammonium hydroxide, which was followed by a modified deep reactive ion etching process to construct nanograss on the valleys of the micropillar arrays. After conformally coating a thin hydrophobic layer and then selectively removing the superficial SiO2 layers and the fluoride polymer coating on the top of the micropillars by buffered oxide etching, the hydrophilic micropillars patterned superhydrophobic surface (Fig. 77a) was obtained. The hydrophilic tops of the micropillars facilitated fast droplet nucleation and initial growth (i.e., filmwise condensation), while the valleys between the micropillars that were covered with superhydrophobic nanograss guaranteed the dropwise condensation and coalescence-induced self-propelled droplet jumping (Fig. 77b). Condensation testing under high concentration of noncondensable gas showed that the patterned superhydrophobic surface had much higher HTC (~ 1.5 \u00b1 0.3 kW\u00b7m\u22122\u00b7K\u22121) than superhydrophobic surface with nanograss alone (~ 0.6 \u00b1 0.2 kW\u00b7m\u22122\u00b7K\u22121) and flat hydrophobic surface (~ 0.9 \u00b1 0.2 kW\u00b7m\u22122\u00b7K\u22121). O\u0308lc\u0327erog\u0306lu et al. prepared nickel nanostructures on Si surfaces via the self-assembly and metallization of Tobacco mosaic virus, and then functionalized the surfaces by using either CVD of a monolayer of trichlorosilane or spin coating of a nanoconformal PTFE film to render them superhydrophobic, which were then patterned using standard lithography techniques and oxygen plasma etching to construct superhydrophilic islands with diameters of 3 \u03bcm (Fig. 77c).723 At low supersaturation (e.g., 1.06), nucleation on the superhydrophobic surface was largely suppressed, while nucleation was significantly promoted on the superhydrophilic islands, enabling 250% larger nucleation density on the patterned surface than superhydrophobic surface without patterns, and both surfaces promoted continuous coalescence induced self-propelled droplets jumping. At high supersaturation (e.g., 1.54), droplets nucleated randomly initially in a suspended morphology on both surfaces. The superhydrophobic surface without patterns subjected rapid transition to local flooding within 60 s. By contrast, the nucleated droplets on patterned surface gradually self-organized into an ordered array as they grew and coalesced laterally (Fig. 77d), enabling continuous formation of large droplets that were loosely bound to the islands and easy to shed off to refresh the suface, which prevented the transition to flooding. In addition, flooding occurred on the superhydrophobic surface when the \u0394T was larger than 20 K, but the patterned surface only witnessed a transition from droplets jumping to shedding removal with no flooding occurred even when the \u0394T increased up to the testing limit of 25 K\n(Fig. 77e). Recently, Hoque et al. coupled individual droplet growth and condensation heat transfer with droplet-jumping dynamics to optimize the design of superhydrophobic nanostructured surfaces with wettability contrast patterns for maximum heat flux.730 They reported that the wettability of the patterns should not be optimized to minimize droplet adhesion while maximizing individual droplet growth rates rather than toward minimizing droplet nucleation energy barriers. It was found that a higher RCA of the patterns minimized individual droplet adhesion, and lower pattern pitch ratio (i.e., the ratio of the pitch between neighboring patterns to the diameter of the patterns) minimized individual droplet thermal resistance during condensation, which could favor a higher global jumping-droplet condensation heat transfer. For example, a patterned superhydrophobic surface with hydrophilic spots (\u03b8RCA \u2264 60 \u00b0), pitch ratio of 8.35, and Ohnesorge number of 0.15 was expected to show a HTC of ~ 54 kW\u00b7m\u22122\u00b7K\u22121, while that with hydrophobic spots (\u03b8RCA = 120 \u00b0) with a low pitch ratio of ~ 3 and Ohnesorge number of 0.15 increases to of ~ 260 kW\u00b7m\u22122\u00b7K\u22121. In addition, they showed that superhydrophobic surface with smooth, low-surface-energy patterns had a 10 times higher HTC compared with superhydrophobic surfaces without patterns.\nHowever, these (quasi) 2D patterned surfaces could not drain the condensed droplets away efficiently, and liquid-bridging phenomenon that eventually evolved into flooding was also observed at high surface subcoolings (Fig. 78a).729,731 To address these problems, Lo et al. proposed a 3D patterned surface consisted of superhydrophobic Si nanowire arrays and hydrophilic microchannels to enhance the condensation at high surface subcoolings.729 As shown in Fig. 78b\u2013d, the microchannels with a depth of\n50 \u03bcm were etched by deep reactive ion etching, and the nanowires with height of 15 \u03bcm were synthesized by an aqueous electroless etching technique and selectively coated with 60-nm-thick PTFE thin layer, yielding superhydrophobic Si nanowire arrays with water CA of ~ 150 \u00b1 3 \u00b0 and hydrophilic Si microchannels with CA of ~ 30 \u00b1 3 \u00b0. The resultant 3D patterned surface had a large wettability contrast and a significant structural height difference between the superhydrophobic and hydrophilic areas, both of which enhanced the dragging of the condensed droplets into the microchannels at high \u0394T (Fig. 78e, f), so the departure diameters (~ 1.5 mm) of condensed droplets on the superhydrophobic areas of the 3D patterned surface were four times smaller than those on the superhydrophobic surface with Si nanowires alone (~ 6 mm). In addition, as depicted in Fig. 78g, the liquid bridges formed at high \u0394T on the 3D patterned surface could be promptly absorbed by the liquid flow in the microchannels in a period of ~ 40 ms after their formation, the self-unbridging thereby prevented the condensing surface from flooding at high \u0394T. Moreover, the thickness of the liquid films in the hydrophilic microchannels was confined to ~ 50 \u03bcm on the 3D patterned surface, which reduced the thermal resistance of the liquid films. As a result, the 3D patterned surface exhibited superior condensation heat transfer performance, and a high heat flux of 655 \u00b1 10 kW\u00b7m\u22122 and a high HTC of 37 \u00b1 2 kW\u00b7m\u22122\u00b7K\u22121 at \u0394T = 18 K were obtained when the width of the microchannels was 1300 \u03bcm.\nAnother strategy to prohibit flooding condensation is to replace the air \u201ccushion\u201d of superhydrophobic surface with a lubricant layer, namely, to use a SLIS that is repellent towards the condensates (including those ones with low surface tensions), and the high droplet mobility on SLIS is favorable to enhance the heat transfer.33,35,573,691,707,709,712,714,716,732-734 For example, Anand et al. studied the condensation on SLIS, and showed that the condensed droplets pinning could be significantly reduced by using a well-designed SLIS.573 If the surface energies of all phases present met eqn (14) (i.e., cloaking), the growth of the condensed droplets would be inhibited. By introducing nanostructures on the microstructures, the droplet-solid pinning could also be drastically reduced. They showed that the condensed droplets as small as 100 \u03bcm in diameter became highly mobile and moved rapidly across the surface at speed that was several orders of magnitude higher than that on superhydrophobic surfaces with identical textures. By designing a SLIS with heterogeneous coatings, Xiao et al. further demonstrated the enhanced immersion condensation on a SLIS that would cloak the condensed droplets.707 They showed that water vapor could diffuse through the cloaking layer and droplets nucleated at the high surface energy sites of lubricant-solid interface. In comparision to superhydrophobic nanostructured CuO surface, drastically increased nucleation densities were observed on the slippery heterogeneous nanostructured CuO surfaces, and the HTC increased by ~ 100% without droplets pinning or flooding over the whole range of\nsupersaturations tested (from 1 to 1.6) in the presence of non-condensable gases. Rykaczewski et al. further studied the dropwise condensation of low surface tension liquids on SLISs, and found that the choice of lubricant and surface textures were crucial to stabilize the lubricant and reduce the pinning of the condensed droplets, and a four to eight-fold improvement in HTC was demonstrated on Krytox oil infused nanotextured alumina-silica surfaces as compared to filmwise condensation.709 Preston et al. also verified the enhanced condensation heat transfer of hydrocarbon (e.g., toluene) liquids on Krytox GPL 101 fluorinated oil infused Cu surface with CuO nanoblades, and a ~ 450% increasement in heat flux was observed in pure vapor condensation compared with that on a flat hydrophobic surface.732 Recently, Tripathy et al. proposed a Cu-based SLIS with an ultrathin (~ 70 nm) vertically grown graphene nanoscaffold infused by Krytox 1525, which doubled the heat transfer performance in comparision to the control SLIS with CuO nanostructures.714 However, owing to the inevitable lubricant depletion, the durability of SLISs during long-term condensation is still a great challenge,732 constructing robust and durable SLISs is thereby of great importance, and slippery liquid-like smooth surfaces with physically or chemically bonded polymer molecules735-737 could be an alternative candicate for enhanced yet durable dropwise condensation.\ndifferent \u0394T.

Copyright (2019) Elsevier Inc.\nBesides the above-discussed passive methods, some active approaches (e.g., applying electric field or vibration) have also been proposed to sustain stable dropwise condensation so as to enhance the heat transfer on liquid-repellent surfaces. For example, Miljkovic et al. found that self-propelled jumping droplets on a nanostructured superdrophobic surface obtained a net positive charge that enabled them to repel each other mid-flight, and the mechanism for the charge accumulation was associated with the formation of the electric double layer at the droplet-surface interface,738 based on which they proposed an electric-field-enhanced condensation on superhydrophobic nanostructured surfaces to improve the overall heat transfer efficiency.708 By considering the fact that the jumping droplets could completely reverse and return to the condensing surface under some conditions (e.g., increased drag on the droplets due to vapor flow), which limits the further enhancement of heat transfer, the authors demonstrated that an externally applied electric field could prevent the reversal and return of the jumping droplets. Compared to a superhydrophobic CuO surface with no applied electric field, 50% higher overall condensation HTCs were obtained by applying electric fields of 100 and 200 V cm\u22121. Zhang et al. demonstrated ultrafast sweeping removal of dropwise condensates via charge density gradient (CDG) induced propelling (Fig. 79a).739 They prepared a soot-templated superhydrophobic coating on glass slide, and then the substrate was polarized by corona charging which injected CDG inside the substrate. By observing the droplet condensation process on the resultant surface, the authors showed that condensed droplet with jump-induced charges started to sweep followed by quick snowball-like sweeping and chase-like propelling (Fig. 79b). As a result, a small average diameter of the condensed droplets (~ 45 \u03bcm), low surface coverage (~ 10%), and high departure rate of the condensed droplets (~ 350 \u03bcL cm\u22122 min\u22121) were obtained on the superhydrophobic surface with CDG inside. Indeed, the heat transfer efficiency of such surface needs to be addressed in the future. Moradi et al. showed that by applying a mechanical vibration on superhydrophobic aluminum alloy surface, condensed droplets shedding events were increased by 120%, resulting in a 15% increase in condensation.740 Oh et al. studied vibration-assisted condensed droplet sweeping and heat transfer on a nanoporous polypropylene film-based SLIS.741 Results showed that after applying vibration, the average radius of the departing droplet was reduced by 38.8% and the average departing velocity was increased by 8.6 times, which siginificantly reduced the overall surface coverage by condensed droplet. In addition, compared with a nonvibrating SLIS, time-averaged droplet radius distribution on a vibrating SLIS demonstrated more droplets with radii < 100 \u03bcm, and instantaneous droplet radius distribution showed a smaller average droplet radius. Heat transfer testing under an ambient environment containing noncondensable gases showed that 40.2% enhancement of heat flux was obtained, which could also be partially attributed to the vibration induced significant resonant motion of the liquid-vapor interface of the condensing droplets that created secondary flows at the\ninterface.\nMoreover, to further enhance condensation heat transfer performance of liquid-repellent surfaces especially for long-term operations, ultrathin coatings with low thermal resistance, low CAH, superior robustness and durability are urgently needed,397,398,400,714,742,743 which are refered to another review.315"

            "text": "In this review, we have systematically summarized the recent progress of liquid-repellent surfaces (including superhydrophobic surface, superoleophobic surface and SLIS) with robustness and durability. Emphasis have been put on the characterisation of wettability, the evaluation methods of the robustness and durability, as well as the design, fabrication and applications of robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces. In spite of significant progress made over the past two decades, a number of directions still need to be further explored.\nCharacterisation of wettability is the foundation of research on liquid-repellent surfaces. CA measurement via sessile-drop goniometry is the most general method to evaluate liquid repellence, while CAH and SA have to be well considered since they reflect the mobility of droplets more accurately and directly. The precision/resolution of the goniometer setup and related software need to be further improved.90,97 Meanwhile, the experimental factors, especially those operator-dependent details (e.g., droplet volume, liquid feeding speed, tangent line/baseline determination methods, etc.), should be\nnormalized and reported in the publications. Meanwhile, adhesive force mapping and solid-liquid/liquid-liquid interface imaging are recommended for the study of liquid repellence from visualized and micro perspectives, such as transition between the Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter states, wetting/de-wetting, lubricant dynamics, etc.\nRobustness and durability should be evaluated and targeted according to the specific application scenario of the liquid-repellent surfaces. On the one hand, diverse evaluation methods have been proposed, but it may be unnecessary to test all aspects of the robustness and durability. For example, superhydrophobic self-cleaning roofs of buildings mainly suffer from raindrops, sands, sunlight, acid rain, etc., so the tolerance towards water droplets/falling sands impacting, UV exposure, and acid corrosion need to be addressed firstly, while other testing can be considered secondary. Meanwhile, in order to present repeatable, comparative and reliable evaluation results of robustness and durability, universal testing standards are urgently needed to be unified. On the other hand, the robustness and/or durability of liquid-repellent surfaces cannot be improved one for all. For instance, a lubricant with high surface tension generally imparts SLIS with better durability in heated water immersion, while a lubricant with high viscosity often lowers lubricant depletion but decreases the mobility of droplets on the surface.431,744 Therefore, the strategies to enhance the robustness and durability should be prudently selected based on their practical service conditions.\nAlthough many strategies have been proposed to prepare robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces, it has to be noted that most of these methods can improve the robustness or durability with only a limited degree or aspects when being used alone, while their selective combination could be more effective and comprehensive.57-59,349,354 Therefore, developing advanced composite methods to construct robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces should be actively focused on in future research.\nMost of the recent progress in preparing liquid-repellent surfaces with increasing robustness and durability remains outweighed by substantial trade-offs in large-scale feasibility, environmental unfriendliness, and expense or complexity of preparation. More significantly, fluorine-compounds that are almost indispensable for the construction of liquid-repellent surfaces may be banned in the near future due to their serious threats to human health.417 To promote the real-world and large-area applications of liquid-repellent surfaces,745 as well as to power the carbon dioxide emissions peak and carbon neutrality,746 it is still urgently needed to develop simple, massively scalable, low-cost, and green methods/raw materials to construct robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces.\nLast but not least, although the emphasis on robustness and durability are continuously increasing in order to move liquid-repellent surfaces towards real-world applications, it has to be noted that the surfaces without robustness and durability are by no means useless. As one of the most typical examples, exposing liquid-repellent surfaces to plasma or UV can sometimes trigger chemical instability and thus damage the liquid repellence, but it is widely employed in creating patterned liquid-repellent surfaces,747,748 stimuli-responsive smart surfaces,749,750 materials with Janus wettability,751 etc. Consequently, while we\u2019re focusing on robust and durable liquid-repellent surfaces, those fragile and\nunstable aspects (towards one or more inducements) should also be skillfully exploited to benefit the research of other functional surfaces."
