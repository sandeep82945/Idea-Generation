According to the WHO\u2019s report, the most common types are breast, lung, colon and rectum, prostate, skin and stomach cancer, while most common causes of cancer death are lung, colon and rectum, liver, stomach and breast cancer. Although cancer is often observed in middle-aged to older adults, it can affect individuals of any age. In the world, more than ten million lives are lost to cancer each year. Despite the availability of numerous anti-cancer drugs, the discovery of potential agents remains crucial to realizing a cure for this debilitating disease. Small organic molecules have received significant attention from researchers in the field of medicinal chemistry in recent decades as potential anticancer agents due to their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, such as i) size (molecular weight less than 500 Da), ii) specificity (interact with specific molecular targets, such as enzymes, receptors, and transporters, with high specificity), iii) stability (small organic molecules are often more stable than larger molecules and can withstand harsh conditions, such as high temperatures and acidic or basic environments), iv) synthesis (small organic molecules can be synthesized in large quantities using chemical synthesis, which can be more cost-effective than producing biologics), v) oral bioavailability (many small organic molecules are orally bioavailable, meaning they can be taken as pills or capsules rather than requiring injection or infusion).

Notably, one of the compounds, namely, 4-(5- amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-N-(4-chlorophenyl)-6morpholino-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine, demonstrated potent EGFR inhibition and caused significant apoptosis in lung cancer cells. These findings suggest that the synthesized compounds could be considered as lead candidates for further research into targetoriented anticancer agents. Ultimately, this study could lead to the development of new and effective treatments for cancer.\nIn the second research article, Jiang et al. synthesized a series of C14 sulfonate tetrandrine derivatives and evaluated their potential as chemotherapeutic agents for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Most of the synthesized compounds demonstrated greater antiproliferative activity against four different HCC cell lines than the lead compound, tetrandrine. A compound, namely, 14-O-(5-chlorothiophene-2-sulfonyl)tetrandrine, showed the strongest antiproliferative effect and was found to induce apoptosis in HCC cells via a mitochondriamediated intrinsic pathway. Additionally, above compound also inhibited HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its potential as a candidate for anti-HCC therapy. This study highlights the potential of structural modifications of natural compounds, like tetrandrine, in the development of novel chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of HCC, which could ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes.\nThis review article reported by Prasher et al. focuses on the anticancer properties of spermidine, a naturally occurring polyamine compound found in semen and plant sources. The authors discuss the molecular mechanisms by which spermidine halts the cell cycle, inhibits tumor cell proliferation, and suppresses tumor growth. They also explore how spermidine triggers autophagy by regulating key oncologic pathways and how chemically modified derivatives of spermidine hold great potential for prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications against various malignancies. In addition to its anticancer properties, spermidine has also shown to have neuroprotective, anti-aging, and antiinflammatory effects. The authors highlight the potential of spermidine as a target for the development of new anticancer chemotherapeutics and emphasize the importance of further clinical translation of spermidine and its analogues for the advancement of cancer medications. Overall, this review provides\nvaluable insights into the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential of spermidine in cancer management.\nTaken together, the three articles in this Research Topic highlight the promising potential of chemical biology in the development of novel and effective treatments for cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as the importance of exploring natural compounds and their derivatives in cancer management. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer pathogenesis and the potential of chemical modifications to improve the efficacy and safety of anticancer drugs."
