    "abstractText": "Arabinoxylan (AX) is a polysaccharide composed of arabinose, xylose, and a small number of other carbohydrates. AX comes from a wide range of sources, and its physicochemical properties and physiological functions are closely related to its molecular characterization, such as branched chains, relative molecular masses, and substituents. In addition, AX also has antioxidant, hypoglycemic, antitumor, and proliferative abilities for intestinal probiotic flora, among other biological activities. AXs of various origins have different molecular characterizations in terms of molecular weight, degree of branching, and structure, with varying structures leading to diverse effects of the biological activity of AX. Therefore, this report describes the physical properties, biological activities, and applications of AX in diverse plants, aiming to provide a theoretical basis for future research on AX as well as provide more options for crop breeding.",

            "text": "AX is a group of hemicelluloses with D-xylose as the building block of the polysaccharide chain; it contains arabinose substituent groups [1]. On the basis of the solubility of AX, AX includes water-extractable arabinoxylan (WEAX) and water-unextractable arabinoxylan (WUAX) [2]. AX from diverse sources varies considerably concerning monosaccharide composition, the molar ratio of arabinose to xylose (Ara/Xyl), structure, and so on. Therefore, various sources can result in different molecular weights and degrees of branching of AX; these structural features affect the biological activity of AX [3]. Recently, attention has been paid to AXs\u2019 potential biological response modifier (BRM) for several years [4]. The unique properties of AX, including ferulic acid content, molecular weight, substitution, and the molar ratio of arabinose to xylose, determine its unique functions in antioxidants, prebiotic properties, immunomodulation, and hypoglycemia. In the aspect of antioxidants, AX shows strong antioxidant activity due to the combination of ferulic acid, coumaric acid, and other phenolic compounds [5]. Malunga et al. [6] found that the antioxidant properties of AX were not only related to the source and total phenolic content but also the degree of xylose residues\u2019 substitution. It can be inferred that the ferulic acid content, average molecular weight, Ara/Xyl ratio, and xylose residue substitution determine the antioxidant capacity of AX. In immunomodulation, AX plays a vital role in the immunomodulatory process of the body. AX was shown to induce dendritic cells to\nPolymers 2023, 15, 225. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15010225 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nproduce the immunomodulatory cytokine Interleukin-10 [7] and strengthen natural killer cell activity [8]. Thus, AX can significantly inhibit the growth of tumor cells. At the same time, Savitha et al. [9] discovered that the immunomodulatory effect of AX was related to its ferulic acid content. In the case of prebiotic properties, AX, which is prebiotic, is responsible for the increase in the number and diversity of intestinal flora [10\u201312]. On the other hand, branched AX could better promote microbial proliferation and improve short-chain fatty acid contents (SCFAs) [13]. Complex trisaccharide side chain structure and terminal xylose content may impact AXs\u2019 prebiotic properties [14]. Due to the fact that the structure-prebiotic properties relationship is complex, the fermentability may be related to Ara/Xyl, which needs further study [15]. In the area of hypoglycemia, AX can promote the growth of intestinal flora, thereby releasing more SCFAs. SCFAs may also stimulate the release of the heterotropic hormone glucagon-like protein 1 (GLP-1) via G proteincoupled receptor 43 (Gpr43) in L cells of gastrointestinal endocrine cells. GLP-1 boosts insulin secretion and improves insulin resistance [16]. Therefore, AX has a hypoglycemic effect because of the increase of GLP-1 in vivo. In addition, several surveys have shown that AX has a variety of biological activities beneficial to humans, as AX helps suppress appetite, delay gastric emptying, and promote bowel movements. In summary, the effect of the AX\u2019s biological activity is related to its structural characteristics. The structure of AX is diverse and complex, and AXs from different sources have various structural characteristics. Therefore, AXs of varying sources have diverse effects on biological activity. Apparently, polysaccharides derived from various plant sources exhibit different properties, which may not be unique to AX. For example, \u03b2-glucans are polysaccharides polymerized from D-glucopyranose monomers linked by \u03b2-bonds. \u03b2-glucan is mainly derived from microorganisms, algae, and cereals. The structural characteristics and biological functions of \u03b2-glucans vary due to their diverse origins. In respect to the structure, cereal \u03b2-glucan is mainly linked by \u03b2-1,3 and \u03b2-1,4 glycosidic bonds, while microbial or algal \u03b2-glucan is mainly linked by \u03b2-1,3 and \u03b2-1,6 glycosidic bonds. In terms of biological activity, oat \u03b2glucan can significantly reduce fasting blood sugar, improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and achieve a hypoglycemic effect [17]; Ganoderma lucidum spores \u03b2-glucan and marine diatom \u03b2-glucan have immune-enhancing effects [18,19].In terms of application, Lentinula edodes \u03b2-glucan, yeast \u03b2-glucan and oat \u03b2-glucan have various effects on starch pasting, gelation, and digestive properties due to their distinct molecular weights and spatial conformations. [20]. In summary, various sources of polysaccharides may have different effects on bioactivity. In recent years, AX has been widely used in various fields. First, AX can be used to make flour products, for example, bread, youtiao, and steamed buns [21\u201323]. Pihlajaniemi et al. [24] developed a new extraction process that consists of the pretreatment of the bran by KOH followed by the enzymatic digestion of the bran. The method productively produced an antioxidant bran syrup with high AX content, which was applied to bread making. The bread did not have a significant discrepancy in sweetness and saltiness compared to typical bread, but the bread produced some off-flavors. Therefore, AX can be made into more flavorful bread, for instance, whole wheat bread and sourdough bread. Secondly, AX has also been applied to the field of film. Rye AX films exhibit excellent oxygen barrier properties (between 0.9~1.0 cm3 \u00b5m/m2 d kPa) [25]. In the examples above, AX has been more widely used in flour products and films. With further awareness of the AX\u2019s functional properties, the AX will certainly be more widely used in more areas, bringing more significant social and economic benefits to enterprises. In overview, more reports have described the relevant aspects of AX. He et al. [26] discussed the extraction method, isolation, purification, and structural characterization of AX. AX has several biological activities, among which the prebiotic effects of AX were described by Chen et al. [27] and Emily Schupfer et al. [28]. Although many reviews focus on extraction, isolation, and purification, these also elaborate on the physicochemical properties and biological activity of AX, and the relationship between the structure and function of AX needs to be explored in depth. However, only a few reviews on the\napplication of AX and related products have been published. Therefore, this paper focuses on the molecular characteristics, biological activities, applications, and related products of AX in different gramineous plants. It aims to provide a theoretical basis for future research on the structure-function relationship of AX and the development of AX-related products while guiding seed source innovation and the breeding of gramineous crops."

Then, AX also exists in some dicotyledonous plants, for instance, Andrographis paniculate and Lauraeae. AXs from various sources varied in molecular weight, monosaccharide composition, Ara/Xyl, and structure.

The molecular weight of sorghum AX is 100\u2013400 kDa, and the molecular weight of dicotyledons AX is around 100 kDa; their molecular weights are smaller than those of gramineous plants. Some wheat and barley AXs have the highest molecular weights, probably because the hydrogen bonding in this AX causes the molecules to aggregate [30]. In addition, Hrom\u00e1dkov\u00e1 et al. [31] also revealed that AX can form aggregates through carbohydrate-protein binding or through the cross-linking of ferulic acid substituents, resulting in larger molecular weights."

            "text": "Monosaccharide composition and Ara/Xyl are described as measures of the degree of AX branching. As can be seen in Table 1, the AXs of most plants consist of arabinose, xylose, glucose, and galactose. Among them, mannose is found in hull-less barley bran AX, wheat flour AX, rye grain AX, sorghum seed AX, and sorghum bran AX; rhamnose is present in wheat bran AX, sorghum AX, lacquered sorghum bran AX; and there is glucuronic acid in all of them. On the other hand, xylose accounts for the largest proportion of AX, followed by arabinose, with galactose and glucose accounting for a relatively small proportion. However, barley hull AX and some varieties of rye grain AX contain 20% glucose, which may contain some glucan, resulting in a high glucose content [32]. The lower the Ara/Xyl, the smaller the degree of AX branching. The pattern and extent of arabinose substitution vary with plant origin and plant tissue location [33]. Within Table 1, Ara/Xyl ranges from 0.11\u20132.85. The Ara/Xyl of sorghum bran AX, the Ara/Xyl of sorghum seeds AX, and the Ara/Xyl of Lauraeae AX are more than 1, and the Ara/Xyl of wheat AX is around 0.9, demonstrating a high degree of branching. On the contrary, the Ara/Xyl of oats AX, the Ara/Xyl of barley hull AX, the Ara/Xyl of corn stover AX, and the Ara/Xyl of Andrographis paniculate AX are below 0.5, indicating a lower degree of branching."

Moreover, the substitution group may contain ferulic acid, 4-O-methylglucuronide [34]. The structural features of diverse sources AX mainly lie in the differences in the type and content of the substituent groups or the substitution positions. In Table 1, 14.78% O-3 is monosubstituted and 10.76% O-2,3 is disubstituted in the AX backbone in hull-less barley bran; 22.1% O-2/3 is monosubstituted and 18.4% O-2,3 is disubstituted in the AX backbone in peeled barley kernels; in the xylan backbone of rye bran AX, it contains 57.71% unsubstituted pyranose residues and 6.22% disubstituted\nxylose. Secondly, the structural features of pangola grass also confirm its high degree of branching, with 60% of it consisting of substituent groups. This means that different AXs have all kinds of degrees of substitution, and the structural differences are mainly reflected by the various substitution positions and degrees of substitution of arabinose.\nNote: \u201c/\u201d indicates that something is not mentioned in the literature. Ara is arabinose; Xyl is xylose; Gal is galactose; Glc is glucose; Rha is rhamnose; Man is mannose; GalA is galacturonic acid; GlcA is glucuronide; UA is glyoxylate."

            "heading": "3.1. AX from Wheat",
            "text": "Wheat is a cereal crop widely grown worldwide and is one of the staple foods of human beings. Wheat is ground into flour to make bread, buns, cookies, noodles, and other foods, while after fermentation, it can be made into beer, alcohol, liquor, and so on. In Table 2, wheat grain and wheat bran contain AX. Diverse investigations have shown that wheat AX has different beneficial effects on the human body, such as prebiotics and immuneenhancing effects. First of all, on the prebiotics side, Figure 1a lists the beneficial effects of AX on the human body in terms of its prebiotic properties. AX can enhance the growth of probiotics and inhibit the growth of non-probiotics. Candela Paesani et al. [47] explored the effect on prebiotic properties through Argentine soft wheat AX and durum wheat AX. They identified a significant promotion effect of AX on the growth of Bifidobacterium. Durum wheat AX was more effective in inhibiting Bifidobacterium growth, and both wheat AXs inhibited Clostridium perfringens. Thus, it confirmed the effectiveness of AX as a potential prebiotic. The degree of substitution of arabinose or ferulic acid was negatively correlated with fermentability [48]. The Ara/Xyl of durum wheat AX in the above study was smaller than that of soft wheat AX, but the fermentation rate of durum wheat AX was higher than that of soft wheat AX, and this phenomenon exactly verified the conclusion. In the same way, Candela Paesani et al. [49] evaluated the in vitro fermentation of AX from two types of wheat and came to conclusions consistent with the studies mentioned above. AX improved the number of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and decreased pH; it also increased short-chain fatty acid content. The results demonstrated that AX could enhance probiotic activity. In immunomodulation activity and antitumor activity, Moerings et al. [50] first demonstrated that wheat-derived arabinoxylan preparations induce training and resilience in human macrophages. This experiment suggested that AX could promote the secretion of interleukins and tumor-damaging factors by macrophages (Figure 1b), thereby enhancing the immune function and antitumor ability of the body. According to the study, they added Argentine soft wheat AX and durum wheat AX to the culture medium of human colon cancer cells-116 (HCT-116) and determined the cell viability after 24h, 48h, and 72 h of incubation, respectively.

This result indicated that AX could inhibit the growth of cancer cells, and the study also demonstrated that AX enhanced the cell viability of macrophages and splenocytes [51]. The biological activities of the two wheat AXs exhibit varying effects, resulting from the differences in glycosidic bonds and arabinose substitutions.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 225 6 of 15Polymers\u00a02023,\u00a015,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 7\u00a0 of\u00a0 18\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(a)\u00a0 (b)\u00a0\nFigure\u00a01.\u00a0Bioactivity\u00a0of\u00a0AX.\u00a0(a)\u00a0prebiotic\u00a0properties;\u00a0(b)\u00a0immunomodulatory\u00a0activity\u00a0of\u00a0AX.\u00a0\n3.2.\u00a0AX\u00a0from\u00a0Barley\u00a0 Barley\u00a0 is\u00a0one\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0world\u2019s\u00a0oldest\u00a0cultivated\u00a0crops,\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0variety\u00a0of\u00a0uses\u00a0such\u00a0as\u00a0 food,\u00a0forage,\u00a0brewing,\u00a0medicinal,\u00a0and\u00a0so\u00a0on.\u00a0Barley\u00a0is\u00a0also\u00a0rich\u00a0in\u00a0AX,\u00a0which\u00a0has\u00a0a\u00a0benefi\u2010 cial\u00a0effect\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0human\u00a0body.\u00a0More\u00a0and\u00a0more\u00a0researchers\u00a0have\u00a0found\u00a0that\u00a0barley\u00a0AX\u00a0has\u00a0 better\u00a0hypoglycemic\u00a0and\u00a0 immunomodulatory\u00a0abilities.\u00a0To\u00a0begin\u00a0with,\u00a0Kento\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a0 [16]\u00a0 extracted\u00a0AX\u00a0from\u00a0barley\u00a0flour\u00a0and\u00a0experimentally\u00a0studied\u00a0the\u00a0hypoglycemic\u00a0ability\u00a0of\u00a0 AX\u00a0in\u00a0mice.\u00a0They\u00a0discovered\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0first\u00a0time\u00a0that\u00a0AX\u00a0promotes\u00a0the\u00a0secretion\u00a0of\u00a0GLP\u20101,\u00a0 which\u00a0in\u00a0turn\u00a0promotes\u00a0the\u00a0secretion\u00a0of\u00a0insulin\u00a0to\u00a0decrease\u00a0blood\u00a0glucose.\u00a0Furthermore,\u00a0 AX\u00a0can\u00a0increase\u00a0the\u00a0SCFA\u00a0content\u00a0owing\u00a0to\u00a0its\u00a0fermentation\u00a0characteristics.\u00a0The\u00a0improve\u2010 ment\u00a0in\u00a0SCFA\u00a0can\u00a0affect\u00a0L\u2010cell\u00a0differentiation\u00a0and\u00a0GLP\u20101\u00a0secretion\u00a0genes,\u00a0thus\u00a0enabling\u00a0 an\u00a0even\u00a0better\u00a0release\u00a0of\u00a0GLP\u20101.\u00a0 Secondly,\u00a0among\u00a0the\u00a0immunomodulatory\u00a0effects,\u00a0barley\u00a0leaves\u00a0AX\u00a0were\u00a0able\u00a0to\u00a0pro\u2010 mote\u00a0the\u00a0secretion\u00a0of\u00a0immunoglobulin\u00a0A\u00a0(IgA).\u00a0It\u00a0was\u00a0concluded\u00a0that\u00a0they\u00a0promote\u00a0the\u00a0 increased\u00a0secretion\u00a0of\u00a0IgA\u00a0by\u00a0inducing\u00a0the\u00a0secretion\u00a0of\u00a0recombinant\u00a0human\u00a0transforming\u00a0 growth\u00a0factor\u00a0(TGF\u2010b1),\u00a0granulocyte\u00a0monocyte\u00a0colony\u2010stimulating\u00a0factor\u00a0(GMCSF),\u00a0and\u00a0 interleukin\u20106\u00a0(IL\u20106)\u00a0[52].\u00a0These\u00a0cytokines\u00a0are\u00a0secreted\u00a0by\u00a0various\u00a0lymphocytes\u00a0associated\u00a0 with\u00a0IgA\u00a0production,\u00a0mainly\u00a0T\u00a0helper\u00a0cells\u00a0[53].\u00a0This\u00a0phenomenon\u00a0further\u00a0suggested\u00a0that\u00a0 the\u00a0substance\u00a0has\u00a0immune\u2010enhancing\u00a0effects.\u00a0One\u00a0additional\u00a0note:\u00a0they\u00a0found\u00a0an\u00a0abun\u2010 dant\u00a0class\u00a0of\u00a0immunoglobulins\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0intestine,\u00a0secretory\u00a0IgA.\u00a0IgA\u00a0is\u00a0considered\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0the\u00a0 first\u00a0line\u00a0of\u00a0defense\u00a0against\u00a0harmful\u00a0substances\u00a0and\u00a0toxins\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0intestinal\u00a0epithelium\u00a0[54].\u00a0 Therefore,\u00a0an\u00a0increase\u00a0in\u00a0IgA\u00a0content\u00a0can\u00a0demonstrate\u00a0an\u00a0increase\u00a0in\u00a0immune\u00a0function.\u00a0\nFigure 1.

Barley is also rich in AX, which has a beneficial effect on the human body. More and more researchers have found that barley AX has better hypoglycemic and immunomodulatory abilities. To begin with, Kento et al. [16] extracted AX from barley flour and experimentally studied the hypoglycemic ability of AX in mice. They discovered for the first time that AX promotes the secretion of GLP-1, which in turn prom tes the secretion of insulin to decrease blood glucose. Fur hermore, AX can increase the SCFA content owing to its fermentation characteristics. The improvement in SCFA can affect L-cell differentiation and GLP-1 secretion genes, thus enabling an even better release of GLP-1. Secondly, among the immunomodulatory effects, barley leaves AX were able to promote the secretion of immunoglobulin A (IgA). It was concluded that they promote the increased secretion of IgA by inducing the secretion of recombinant human transforming growth factor (TGF-b1), granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) [52]. These cy okines are secreted by various lymphocytes associated with IgA production, ai ly T helper cells [53]. Th s phenomenon further suggested that the substance has immune-enhancing effects. One additional note: they found an abundant class of immunoglobulins in the intestine, secretory IgA. IgA is considered to be the first\nline of defense against harmful substances and toxins in the intestinal epithelium [54]. Therefore, an increase in IgA content can demonstrate an increase in immune function."

Few studies have been conducted on the biological activity of sorghum AX, and only a few have investigated the antioxidant activity of sorghum AX. Fabiola E [55] proposed the antioxidants white sorghum AX, red sorghum AX, and high-tannin sorghum bran AX. Furthermore, it showed that these three types of sorghum AXs had high antioxidant capacity, while high-tannin sorghum bran AX exhibited the highest antioxidant activity. The explanation for this is that AX contained a large number of tannins with antioxidant activity."

Rice bran is the outer layer of rice, which can be used to extract oil and make pickles. Equally, rice bran contains a considerable amount of AX. Several studies have proved that rice bran AX has antitumor ability and antioxidant capacity. On the one hand, Nariman K. et al. [56] demonstrated the chemopreventive effect of rice bran AX on the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in mice. They made mice carcinogenic by N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) and CCl4, and fed mice biological bran containing AX. The results indicated that the AX-containing biobran could inhibit hepatocarcinogenesis by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting inflammation and cancer cell proliferation. Meanwhile, it has been reported that rice bran AX can also destroy neuroma cells through in vivo and in vitro experiments [8], which is more robust evidence that rice bran AX has antitumor ability. On the other hand, rice bran AX had a higher chemical antioxidant capacity with a higher DPPH scavenging rate and Fe2+ reduction capacity, mainly because of the higher content of this AX-bound phenolic acid. The biological antioxidant capacity of this AX in cells was also high but not related to the content of bound phenolic acids [57]."

China is one of the countries with the largest cultivation area. With the massive production of corn processing by-products, it is essential to achieve resource recycling to reduce resource waste. Corn cobs, corn stover, and corn bran contain substantial amounts of AX, and AX in corn bran can promote intestinal probiotics\u2019 growth. Xu et al. [58] further studied the in vitro fermentation characteristics of corn bran AX. The experimental studies revealed that AX could promote gas production and SCFA production by intestinal flora, which suggested that AX could promote the growth of intestinal flora. This study illustrates that the high branching complexity of corn bran AX causes a gradual slowing of the fermentation characteristics of the intestinal flora, consistent with the conclusions drawn from wheat AX prebiotics. Meanwhile, Hubert W. Lopez et al. [59] have also demonstrated that corn bran AX promotes the proliferation of intestinal flora through in vivo experiments in rats; the study also demonstrated the ability of AX to lower plasma cholesterol levels in rats. Besides, AX also has an antioxidant capacity, and some studies showed that AX with a higher hydroxycinnamic acid content had a stronger antioxidant capacity [60]."

AX significantly raised the storage modulus of the dough, indicating that the dough is more elastic, demonstrating that AX can be applied to dough products [61]. AX is divided into WEAX and WUAX. WEAX is helpful for the dough to form small gluten agglomerates, improves the stability of the gluten protein network, and makes the dough form a uniform and dense gluten network [62]. Moreover, it can increase the strength and elasticity of the gluten in the dough to obtain a more resilient dough [63]. WUAX is added to the dough to protect the gluten protein\u2019s hydrogen and disulfide bond conformations [64]. However, WUAX can contribute to a large and uneven hole in the product, which eventually causes the flour product to harden [65]. After adding WEAX and WUAX to the youtiao, the results demonstrated that WEAX and WUAX changed the conformation of gluten molecules and inhibited the formation of some disulfide bonds, as well as the thermal aggregation of gluten proteins. WEAX reduced gluten\u2019s surface hydrophobicity and increased gluten\u2019s solubility, while WUAX showed the opposite results [22]. WUAX and WEAX exhibit different properties in the dough. Therefore, the properties of both AXs need to be further examined to develop the flour products better."

Similarly, another publication showed that Young\u2019s modulus of films made from corn cob AX increased to 1400\u20131600 MPa and the strength improved to about 53 MPa [69], making this AX a suitable matrix material for film applications. These are enough to prove that AX can make high-quality films. What is more, AX has also been studied in edible coating films. AX can also apply a coating film to fruits and vegetables to preserve and extend their storage period. Usman Ali et al.

However, AX comes from a wide range of sources, its structure is diverse, and there are discrepancies in the biological activities of diverse structural AX. In order to be able to study the structure-function relationship of AX clearly, this paper reviews the molecular characterization and biological activities of different sources of AX to lay the theoretical foundation for the study of the structure-function relationship. Meanwhile, AX-related products have been developed and launched into the consumer market, where they are well accepted by consumers. Therefore, this paper also reviews and discusses the application of AX and related products, aiming to provide new perspectives for future research. The biological activity of AX is closely related to its structure, such that different sources of AX will exhibit various biological activities. However, the structure-bioactivity re-\nlationship of AX still needs to be clarified. Therefore, more in vivo and in vitro experiments are needed to clarify the specific structure of AX and achieve the desired biological function. The natural extract AX has various physiological functions and can be used as an active ingredient in dietary supplements, functional foods, pharmaceuticals, etc. AX is used in food, chemical, and bioengineering applications. Both WEAX and WUAX cause foods to exhibit different properties and sensory characteristics, and further research is needed to investigate the role played by both types of AXs in foods. As a renewable hemicellulose, AX has promising cross-linking properties and can be used for the preparation of gels, films, etc. The development of AX products needs to be further explored.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization: Y.Z.
