    "abstractText": "This study aimed to understand how teacher trust in others (TTO) and teacher commitment (TC) co-mediate the path from school leadership (SL) to students\u2019 reading literacy (RL). Altogether 1,223 Grade 8 students (female =647; male = 576, Mage = 15.35, SD = 1.28) and their 34 principals from 34 secondary schools in rural western China were sampled and matched. All the students completed the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA 2008) reading tests, and their principals completed the Leading and Teaching in Schools Survey Scale online which the variables of SL, TTO, and TC were evaluated. In addition, the \u201cmany to many\u201d step was employed to match principals\u2019 data with the students\u2019 data by STATA analysis. The results indicated that: (1) there were direct and indirect effects of SL on student RL in the mediation model; (2) the serial mediation of TTO and TC was significant between SL and RL. This finding implies that enhancing TTO and TC in rural schools will help improve student\u2019s RL.",

Altogether 1,223 Grade 8 students (female\n=647; male = 576, Mage = 15.35, SD = 1.28) and their 34 principals from 34 secondary schools in rural western China were sampled and matched.

According to the Ontario Leadership Framework (OLF; Leithwood, 2012), teachers\u2019 \u201cemotions path\u201d includes TC, teacher trust in others (TTO), and teachercollective efficacy. The existing literature has confirmed the important role of teachers\u2019 \u201cemotions path\u201d in mediating between school leadership (SL) and student achievement in North American schools (Leithwood et\u00a0al., 2010, 2019a,b; Handford and Leithwood, 2019).

From the previous study, every path of the OLF contained multiple variables and each variable played a different role in the path. So, it was important to understand how the variables interacting in the paths between SL and student achievement (Zhu et\u00a0 al., 2020). For instance, TTO and TC were highly correlated and might impact their emotions (Lau and Rowlinson, 2009; Buvik and Tvedt, 2016; Ghazinejad et\u00a0al., 2018). And in particular, the variables of TTO and TC had been also found that had an indirect effect between SL and student achievement by Emotions path (Sun and Leithwood, 2015; Handford and Leithwood, 2019; Leithwood et\u00a0al., 2019b). Therefore, TTO and TC might play mediating or moderating roles in the path from SL to student achievement. To verify their roles, this study proposed a serial mediation model and tested it with the data from 1,223 students and 34 secondary school principals in rural western China.\nSchool leadership on reading literacy\nSchool leadership can mobilize and work with others to achieve common goals and has two core functions: setting direction and influencing others (Leithwood and Riehl, 2005). The relationship between SL and student achievement has been extensively explored by leadership scholars, who aimed to unveil the impacting mechanism of SL on student achievement. Two research directions have emerged from the existing studies. The first direction was exploring the direct effect of SL on student achievement. For instance, the original Claim 1 made by Leithwood et\u00a0al. (2008) indicated that school leaders had a direct effect on student achievement: \u201cschool leadership is second only to classroom teaching as an influence on pupil learning.\u201d And this direct effect has also been proved by many studies (Short and Spencer, 1989; Lambert, 1998; Nettles, 2005; Silva et\u00a0al., 2011; Day et\u00a0al., 2016; Hitt and Tucker, 2016; Huang and Zhao, 2017). In particular, Nettles (2005) found that SL could directly influence students\u2019 reading achievement, labeled as instructional leadership. In the Chinese context, Huang and Zhao (2017) also found SL positively affected students\u2019 reading literacy (RL) examined by the PISA 2012. In addition, a recent study in rural China (Zhu et\u00a0al., 2020; Li et al., 2022) also found a direct effect of SL on student achievement.\nThe second direction was examining the indirect effect between SL and student reading achievement. Hallinger et\u00a0 al. (1996) had surveyed 36 school superintendents and an indirect effect of instructional leadership on student reading achievement. Later, Mitchell and Tarter (2016) found that the relationship between SL and reading achievement was mediated by school academic optimism climate. In addition, Leithwood et\u00a0al. (2019b) examined the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness program results and found that \u2018rational path\u2019 had a significant indirect effect. And SL impacted the reading achievement through the \u2018rational\u2019 and \u2018emotions paths\u2019. Recently, Zhu et\u00a0 al. (2020) verified this finding with the data from rural schools in western\nChina and found that SL had a significant indirect effect on RL through emotions and organizational path. However, the \u201cemotions path\u201d mediating effect was negative, indicating that some unidentified factors such as TTO and TC should be\u00a0involved in the model. This study will explore their possible mediating effects between the path from SL to RL to fill this gap.\nThe role of teacher trust in others\nTrust is necessary for teachers to actively and continuously participate in school improvement (Bryk and Schneider, 2002). Teacher Trust in Others includes the trust of the principals, colleagues, parents, and students (Leithwood et\u00a0 al., 2017). The existing studies have found that TTO was highly correlated with school effectiveness, school atmosphere and was also influenced by school environment and SL (Tarter et\u00a0al., 1995; Hoy et\u00a0al., 1996; Goddard et\u00a0al., 2001; Leithwood et\u00a0al., 2010; Hallam et\u00a0al., 2015). This might be\u00a0because the tone of the school atmosphere, especially the atmosphere of trust, was established by school leaders (Bryk et\u00a0 al., 2010). With the trust in school leaders, teachers could collaborate around a unified school goal and plan to drive school improvement collaboratively (Bryk et\u00a0al., 2010). Therefore, TTO in principals might directly or indirectly impact student achievement (Chughtai and Buckley, 2009; Supovitz et\u00a0al., 2010; Notman and Henry, 2011; Salfi, 2011; Sebastian and Allensworth, 2012; Forsyth and Adams, 2014; Tschannen-Moran, 2014; Zeinabadi, 2014; Heather et\u00a0al., 2015). In particular, Heather et\u00a0al. (2015) found that TTO not only had a direct effect and an indirect effect through school atmosphere factors (such as teacher\u2019s professionalism, academic atmosphere, and learning community).\nAccordingly, some studies have explored the mediating role of TTO in the relationship between SL and student achievement. For instance, Heather et\u00a0al. (2015) found that TTO played a mediating role between SL and student achievement and was significantly correlated with academic atmosphere, teachers\u2019 collective effectiveness, and teachers\u2019 professionalism. In addition, TTO was one of the key variables in the \u201cemotions path\u201d proposed by Leithwood\u2019s team, and its mediating effect has been verified by the team (Sun and Leithwood, 2015; Handford and Leithwood, 2019; Leithwood et\u00a0al., 2019b). Furthermore, this finding was verified with the data from rural Chinese schools (Zhu et\u00a0 al., 2020). Therefore, this study will explore its mediating role between SL and student achievement in rural Chinese schools."

            "text": "As one of the key variables in the \u201cemotions path\u201d proposed by the Ontario Leadership Framework (Leithwood, 2012), TC has four dimensions: commitment to teaching, to students, to organization, to change. On the one hand, TC was found highly associated with principals\u2019 behaviors and leadership in a school environment (Hoy et\u00a0al., 1990; Hallinger, 2003; Nguni et\u00a0al., 2006; Fancera and Bliss,\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\n2011; Lambersky, 2016; Qadach et\u00a0al., 2019; Cansoy et\u00a0al., 2020). For instance, many studies (Sabir et\u00a0al., 2011; Fasola et\u00a0al., 2013) have found a significant correlation between SL and TC. Recently, Cansoy et\u00a0al. (2020) found that instructional leadership had a direct impact on TC. Some recent studies also confirmed the close relationship between SL and TC (Li et\u00a0al., 2018; Zhu et\u00a0al., 2020). On the other hand, the existing literature has confirmed a significant direct relationship between TC and student achievement (Rosenholtz, 1989; Hatton, 1997; Harvey et\u00a0al., 1998; Housego, 1999; Ingersoll, 2001; Strahan et\u00a0al., 2001; Caprara et\u00a0al., 2006; Johnson et\u00a0al., 2012; Pranita, 2018). For example, Rosenholtz (1989) found that TC could significantly predict student achievement in reading and math. All these findings jointly indicated that TC might mediate SL and student achievement. Therefore, this study would test this mediating effect with data from rural Chinese schools."

However, the inter-relationships between TTO and TC have not been explored. For instance, TTO was found significantly correlated to TC and affected team performance, directly or indirectly (Jones and George, 1998; Brower et\u00a0al., 2000; Dirks and Ferrin, 2001; Burke et\u00a0al., 2007; Yang and Mossholder, 2009; Rachid et\u00a0al., 2011). In particular, TTO was found a necessary factor to maintain teachers\u2019 commitment to school improvement, participation in collaboration, and professional learning (Tarter et\u00a0al., 1995; Bryk and Schneider, 2002, 2003; Louis, 2007; Tschannen-Moran, 2014; Liu et al., 2016), and could enhance TC (Ghazinejad et\u00a0al., 2018). In addition, as for the composition of TTO mentioned above, TTO included teachers\u2019 trust to principals, colleagues, parents and students. As for teacher trust in principals, studies had shown a significant correlation with TC (Hoy and Tschannen-Moran, 1999; Aryee and Chen, 2006; Leithwood et\u00a0al., 2010; Thoonen et\u00a0al., 2012; Sleegers et\u00a0 al., 2014). Similarly, teacher trust in their\ncolleagues was to a large extent related to the central mission of the school. The higher the degree of trust among teachers, the more willing they were to collaborate with their colleagues, and the higher their commitment to students would be\u00a0(TschannenMoran, 2009). Studies had also pointed out that TTO was a necessary factor in maintaining teachers\u2019 commitment to school changing and professional learning (Tarter et\u00a0al., 1995; Bryk and Schneider, 2002, 2003; Tschannen-Moran, 2004; Louis, 2007). This meant there was a close relationship between TTO and TC, and TTO can significantly predict TC.\nTherefore, we\u00a0hypothesized that TTO and TC might be\u00a0the serial mediators in the path from SL to student achievement and proposed a serial mediation model (see Figure\u00a01) to examine in this study. In particular, this study would examine the following hypotheses:\nH1: School leadership have a direct impact on students\u2019 RL.\nH2: Teacher trust in others mediate the relationship between SL and students\u2019 RL.\nH3: Teacher commitment mediate the effect of SL on students\u2019 RL.\nH4: Teacher trust in others and TC play the serial mediation model fit the relationship between SL and RL."

In particular, SL could predict TTO (\u03b2 = 0.460, p < 0. 001) and TC (\u03b2 = 0.133, p < 0.001), and TTO could predict TC (\u03b2 = 0.7413, p < 0.001) and RL (\u03b2 = \u2212 0.185, p < 0. 01). And TC could predict RL, \u03b2 = 0.097, p < 0. 05.\nThe best-fit modelling (Model 6) results indicated that: (1) the indirect effect of SL \u2192 TTO \u2192 RL was significant, \u03b2 = \u22120.085, SE = 0.023, 95% CI = (\u22120.133, \u22120.041), not crossing zero; (2) the indirect effect of SL \u2192 TC \u2192 RL was also significant, \u03b2 = 0.013, SE = 0.007, 95% CI = (0.001, 0.027), not crossing zero; (3) the indirect effect of SL \u2192 TTO \u2192 TC \u2192 RL was also significant, \u03b2 = 0.033, SE = 0.016, 95% CI = (0.002, 0.065), not crossing zero. All these results jointly indicated that teacher trust and TC had a serial mediation effect on the relationship between SL and RL (see Figure\u00a02; Table\u00a03).\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "This study\u2019s primary objective was to understand how TTO and TC jointly mediate the path from SL to RL in rural Chinese schools. The results have confirmed the serial mediating effects of TTO and TC. This section will discuss these findings and their implications for teacher development, SL, and improvement.\nDirect relationship between school leadership and reading literacy\nThis study found a significant direct impact of SL on students\u2019 RL in rural Chinese schools. First, this might be\u00a0attributed to the principals and their SL. This is because the rural schools in western\nChina have so limited teaching resources that principals have to lead the managing and teaching simultaneously, and some even have to teach many classes (Zhu et\u00a0al., 2020). In this specific circumstance, instructional leadership becomes the most prominent part of SL; accordingly, SL could directly affect student\u2019s RL. Similar findings have been reported by Tan (2018) and Zhu et\u00a0al. (2020), who found that Chinese principals tend to be\u00a0 instructional leaders in rural schools or disadvantaged contexts. In addition, as the leader of change, principals have to understand the school curriculum and pedagogy, plan for school improvement with teachers, and provide appropriate feedback to colleagues (Krug, 1992). All these instructional leadership activities will impact school learning environments, methods, and outcomes (Waters et\u00a0al., 2003; Nettles, 2005; Day et\u00a0al., 2016; Hitt and Tucker, 2016). Eventually, SL can influence students and their learning outcomes by setting high expectations and monitoring learning progress (Nettles et\u00a0al., 2007; Kraft et\u00a0al., 2015). Given the high dropout rates in rural schools of western china, principal\u2019s every single measure or effort matters.\nSecond, the students, especially those in rural or disadvantaged contexts, are more sensitive to the principal\u2019s instructional leadership. For example, Tan (2018) compared the impact of instructional leadership on different types of students and found that it could significantly improve disadvantaged students\u2019 academic performance. In other non-Chinese contexts, SL was also found very effective in improving the academic performance of students with low SES background or in rural areas (Hallinger and Murphy, 1985; Andrews and Soder, 1987; Brewer, 1993; Kaplan et\u00a0 al., 2005; Robinson et\u00a0al., 2008; Shatzer et\u00a0al., 2014; Kraft et\u00a0al., 2015; Dutta and Sahney, 2016). The rural schools in western Chinese are challenging for the principal, teachers, and students. In this challenging context, SL does have a direct impact on students\u2019 RL."

First, TTO is necessary for them to participate actively and continuously in school improvement, especially in those challenging contexts (Bryk and Schneider, 2002; Zhang and Pang, 2016). On the basis of Piotr Sztompka Trust Theory, Trust was understood as a cultural rule which was an attribute of society as a whole. And the trust culture was considered as a product of history which seen as the result of collective, shared positive experiences of members of society over a long period of time. Trust behavior was built on three bases, namely the trust in others and the actor\u2019s tendency to trust and trust culture (Sztompka, 1999). For the trust in others, in particular, TTO includes teacher trust in principals and teacher trust in colleagues (Tschannen-Moran and Hoy, 1998). Teacher trust in principals indicates that they believe that the principal will keep their promise and act for the school\u2019s best interest. Teacher trust in their colleagues implies that they are confident that they can depend on each other, rely on each other, and be\u00a0loyal to each other even in those challenging circumstances. In addition, teachers\u2019 trust in the organization is also a key factor in maintaining their commitment to the school (Ferres et\u00a0al., 2004). The higher trust in the school, the higher commitment to the school, and the more efforts to improve performance (McDonough, 2000). Therefore, TTO plays a significant mediating role in the path from SL to students\u2019 RL.\nSecond, TTO is highly correlated with TC (Brower et\u00a0al., 2000; Dirks and Ferrin, 2001; Burke et\u00a0 al., 2007; Lau and Rowlinson, 2009; Rachid et\u00a0al., 2011; Buvik and Tvedt, 2016; Ghazinejad et\u00a0al., 2018). This is because trust is the premise of commitment and has an important impact on commitment (Mohamed et\u00a0 al., 2012; Chen et\u00a0 al., 2015; Fard and Karimi, 2015; Martin and Siebert, 2016; Ghazinejad et\u00a0 al., 2018). Accordingly, TC could be\u00a0strengthened if teachers trust their principals and colleagues (Ware and Kitsantas, 2007). This is why TTO and TC jointly play the roles of chain mediation in this study. In the rural schools of western China, even though principals directly impact students\u2019 RL, they have to build an environment to nurture TTO and TC and establish a collaborative school culture. In such a challenging context, the rural teachers aspire for trust in others and other\u2019s trust, which would enhance their faith and commitment level. With high levels of trust and commitment, they will be\u00a0more willing to follow school leaders and join their efforts to improve teaching\nand learning. This will eventually pay off in students\u2019 academic performance."

            "text": "This study has proposed and established a serial mediation model to demonstrate the joint mediating effects of TTO and TC in the relationship between SL and RL in rural western China. First, a significant direct effect of SL was found, indicating that principals could impact students\u2019 RL directly in rural Chinese schools. Second, TTO and TC sequentially and jointly mediate the path from SL to students\u2019 RL, indicating that teachers\u2019 roles are important and influential.\nHowever, this study has some major limitations. First, the number of students matched with the principals was small due to low return rates. This would have a certain influence on the conclusion. Second, the sample was limited to a county in rural China; thus, the findings could not reflect those schools in urban China. In the future, students from urban schools should be\u00a0sampled to verify the findings of this study further.\nNevertheless, this study has some important implications for school management and teacher development. First, the finding that TTO and TC play a serial mediating role indicates that more attention should be\u00a0paid to building a caring and collaborative school culture. In particular, the distributed leadership could be\u00a0established in rural schools to build up a collaborative culture that values trust, commitment, and collaboration. Towards this ends, the professional learning community could be\u00a0developed in these rural schools (Wang et\u00a0al., 2017). With the help of this community, principals could fully maximize the subjectivity and potential of teachers and enhance their trust, commitment, and teaching. And more public and policy attention should be\u00a0 paid to the teachers\u2019 emotions and interests in rural schools, who are suffering from the limited resources and disadvantaged environments (Liu, 2016). Second, SL training programs should be\u00a0 provided to those principals in rural schools and other disadvantaged areas. These in-service training will empower principals with the knowledge and skills to embrace the challenges and opportunities faced by their schools. Local educational authorities should be\u00a0more aggressive, innovative, and proactive in developing and delivering these in-service training and supporting programs. These remedial measures to teachers and\nTABLE\u00a03 Direct and indirect effects of school leadership on reading literacy."
