    "abstractText": "The non-axisymmetric problem of frictionless contact between an isotropic elastic halfspace and a cylindrical punch with an arbitrarily shaped base is considered. The contact problem is formulated as a two-dimensional Fredholm integral equation of the first type in a fixed circular domain with the right-hand side being representable in the form of a Fourier series. A number of general solutions of the contact problem, which were published in the literature, are discussed. Based on the Galin\u2013Mossakovskii general solution, new formulas are derived for the particular value of the contact pressure at the contact center and the contact stress-intensity factor at the contour of the contact area. Since the named general solution does not employ the operation of differentiation of a double integral with respect to the coordinates that enter it as parameters, the form of the general solution derived by Mossakovskii as a generalization of Galin\u2019s solution for the special case, when the contact pressure beneath the indenter is bounded, is recommended for use as the most simple closed-form general solution of the non-axisymmetric Boussinesq contact problem.",

            "text": "The contact mechanics dates back to Hertz (1882), who developed the theory of unilateral frictionless local contact for two elastic bodies, which in the unloaded state are shaped as elliptic paraboloids in the vicinity of the point of initial contact, and Boussinesq (1885), who solved the problem of contact between an elastic half-space and a frictionless flat-ended cylindrical punch. Since then, particular progress has been made with regard to solving the axisymmetric frictionless problems with a circular area of contact. While in the literature, the general solution of the axisymmetric problem is usually associated with Sneddon\u2019s paper [1] of 1965, different authors give the priority to other studies. In particular, in his comprehensive review, Borodich [2] highlighted the contribution made by Galin (1946); Barber [3] in his book referred to the general solution as the Green and Collins solution; in their historical note [4] (see also [5]), Popova and Popov, acknowledging the contributions made by Galin and Sneddon, put under a spotlight the original paper [6] written in German by Schubert in 1942. However, for the sake of historical truth, it should be underlined that (to the best of the author\u2019s knowledge) the priority of solving the axisymmetric frictionless contact problem with a circular contact area belongs to Leonov\u2019s paper [7] published in Russian in 1939. As it was shown by Argatov and Dmitriev [8], other forms of the general solution follow from Leonov\u2019s results by the simple change of integration variables. As a compromise, Argatov and Mishuris [9] suggested to call the general solution of the axisymmetric frictionless contact problem the Galin\u2013Sneddon solution. The general solution of the non-axisymmetric contact problem for a cylindrical indenter is of great importance in developing the contact stiffness indentation tomography technique [10,11]. Another example of the application of the general solution is given by\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 1083. https://doi.org/10.3390/sym14061083 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry\nthe problem of adhesive contact under non-symmetric perturbation of the contact geometry [12]. Generally speaking, the general solutions collected below will be useful in solving the frictionless contact problems with a circular area of contact (e.g., with applications in geotechnics [13,14]), when the symmetry of the contact geometry does not matter. Whereas axisymmetric contact problems are considered in many publications, including textbooks [3,8] and handbook [15], the situation with the non-axisymmetric contact problem with a circular area of contact is not so equivocal, even in spite of the fact that this problem is a direct generalization of the Boussinesq problem for a cylindrical punch with a non-flat base. This paper aims to bridge this gap by comparing different general solutions published in the literature. The main motivation for writing this reviewer paper was to identify in a sense the simplest closed form of the general solution. Another quite utilitarian motivation was to collect in one compendium the practically useful results, some of which are not readily accessible. Herein, we compare only the solutions collected from the literature, and the discussion of the methods of their derivations falls outside the scope of the present study. The recent paper [16] on solving Keer\u2019s indentation problem for a cylindrical indenter with the face in a wedge form can be regarded as a case study for the use of the general solutions."

            "text": "2.1. The Boussinesq Contact Problem Formulation\nWe consider the so-called Boussinesq contact problem for an isotropic elastic halfspace (see Figure 1), which is indented by a frictionless cylindrical punch of radius a with a non-flat base described by a continuous shape function, \u03a6(r, \u03d5). For the sake of simplicity we assume that the center of cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03d5, z) is taken at the center of the circular area of contact, and the elastic semi-infinite body occupies the half-space z \u2265 0.\nLet us assume that the shape function \u03a6(r, \u03d5) admits the Fourier series representation\n\u03a6(r, \u03d5) = \u03a60(r) + \u221e\n\u2211 n=1\n\u03a6sn(r) sin n\u03d5 + \u03a6 c n(r) cos n\u03d5, (1)\nwhere\n\u03a60(r) = 1\n2\u03c0 2\u03c0\u222b 0 \u03a6(r, \u03d5)d\u03d5, { \u03a6sn(r) \u03a6cn(r) } = 1 \u03c0 2\u03c0\u222b 0 \u03a6(r, \u03d5) { sin n\u03d5 cos n\u03d5 } d\u03d5. (2)\nSince the function \u03a6(r, \u03d5) is assumed to be continuous, it can be shown that \u03a6sn(0) = \u03a6cn(0) = 0. In addition, we put\n\u03a60(0) = 0. (3)\nFurther, let p(r, \u03d5) denote the contact pressure exerted by the punch under the action of an external load, F. Then, the condition of static equilibrium implies that\nF = 2\u03c0\u222b 0 a\u222b 0 p(r, \u03d5)r drd\u03d5. (4)\nAccording to the Boussinesq solution of the problem of normal loading of an elastic half-space, the contact pressure p(r, \u03d5) produces the following normal surface displacement field:\nuz(r, \u03d5) = 1\n\u03c0E\u2217 2\u03c0\u222b 0 a\u222b 0 p(\u03c1, \u03d5)\u03c1 d\u03c1d\u03c8\u221a r2 + \u03c12 \u2212 2r\u03c1 cos(\u03d5\u2212 \u03c8) . (5)\nHere, E\u2217 = E/(1\u2212 \u03bd2) is the reduced elastic modulus, E and \u03bd are Young\u2019s modulus and Poisson\u2019s ratio of the elastic semi-infinite body, (r, \u03d5) are coordinates of the point of observation, and (\u03c1, \u03d5) are coordinates of the point of integration. Inside the contact area, the normal surface displacements are determined by the shape of the punch, which under the applied load receives some vertical (normal) displacement, \u03b40, such that\nuz(r, \u03d5) = \u03b40 \u2212\u03a6(r, \u03d5), r \u2208 [0, a], \u03d5 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0). (6)\nThus, from (5) and (6), it follows that\n1 \u03c0E\u2217 2\u03c0\u222b 0 a\u222b 0 p(\u03c1, \u03d5)\u03c1 d\u03c1d\u03c8\u221a r2 + \u03c12 \u2212 2r\u03c1 cos(\u03d5\u2212 \u03c8) = \u03b40 \u2212\u03a6(r, \u03d5), (7)\nwhere r \u2208 [0, a] and \u03d5 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0). The integral Equation (7) is called the governing integral equation of the Boussinesq contact problem with the circular contact area of radius a. It is to emphasize that in contrast to the Hertz contact problem, where the contact area is determined from the condition of vanishing of the contact pressure on the contour of the contact area, in the Boussinesq contact problem, the contact area is assumed to be a priori fixed. Correspondingly, the contact pressure density p(r, \u03d5), which solves Equation (7), may possess a singularity at the contact contour, as the point of observation (r, \u03d5) approaches the contact contour, when r \u2192 a.\nTo simplify formulas, we introduce the auxiliary notation\nf (r, \u03d5) = \u03b40 \u2212\u03a6(r, \u03d5) (8)\n= f0(r) + \u221e\n\u2211 n=1\nf sn(r) sin n\u03d5 + f c n(r) cos n\u03d5, (9)\nwhere, in view of (1), we have\nf0(r) = \u03b40 \u2212\u03a60(r), f sn(r) = \u2212\u03a6sn(r), f cn(r) = \u2212\u03a6cn(r). (10)\nWe note that a rigid body, by means of which external loads are transferred to the surface of an elastic body, is usually called an indenter. Here we prefer the term \u2018punch\u2019, as the term \u2018indenter\u2019 (in many cases) assumes unilateral contact, when only positive contact pressures are allowed inside the contact area. Finally, we note that, in view of (3), the parameter \u03b40 has the exact meaning of the normal surface displacement at the center of the contact area. If \u03a6(r, \u03d5) \u2265 0 for any r \u2208 [0, a] and \u03d5 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0), then in the unloaded state, the punch touches the surface of the elastic half-space at the center of the coordinates, and therefore, the parameter \u03b40 can be interpreted as the displacement of the punch under the applied load F. Provided that the punch shape function \u03a6(r, \u03d5) is known, the equilibrium Equation (4) establishes a relation between the contact force F and the punch displacement \u03b40.\nRemark 1. It is pertinent to note here that to have an axisymmetric displacement in the Boussinesq problem, the indenter shape should be axisymmetric. However, an axisymmetric shape of the indenter in unilateral contact does not necessarily imply that the established axisymmetric contact region is circular (see, for example, [17,18]), where indenters of toroidal-type shapes produce an annular contact region, or [19], where the contact region under a non-convex parametric\u2013homogeneous punch is composed from a central circular part and a number of concentric annular regions). On the other hand, the Boussinesq contact problem with a circular area of contact will be non-axisymmetric if the indenter shape function \u03a6(r, \u03d5) essentially depends on the angular coordinate \u03d5, that is, if the Fourier series (9) contains at least one nontrivial term starting from n = 1.\n2.2. Copson\u2019s Series Solution\nIn view of (1), the general solution of Equation (7) can be represented in the form\np(r, \u03d5) = p0(r) + \u221e\n\u2211 n=1\npsn(r) sin n\u03d5 + p c n(r) cos n\u03d5. (11)\nAccording to Copson (1947), the coefficients of the Fourier series (11) are determined by the following formulas [20]:\npn(r) = \u2212 E\u2217\n\u03c0 rn\u22121 d dr a\u222b r gn(\u03c1)\u03c1 d\u03c1\u221a \u03c12 \u2212 r2 , (12)\nwhere\ngn(\u03c1) = 1 \u03c12n d d\u03c1 \u03c1\u222b 0 rn+1 fn(r)\u221a \u03c12 \u2212 r2 dr. (13)\nTo be more precise, the coefficients psn(r) and pcn(r) are given by Formulas (12) and (13) upon replacing fn(r) with f sn(r) and f cn(r), respectively. We note that in the case n = 0, Formulas (12) and (13) represent the Galin\u2013Sneddon solution of the axisymmetric contact problem. The general solution of the non-axisymmetric contact problem in the series from (12) and (13) was also independently derived by Mossakovskii [21].\n2.3. Mossakovskii\u2019s Series Solution\nUnder the assumption that the functions f0(r), f sn(r), and f cn(r) are continuously differentiable in the interval (0, a), Mossakovskii (1953) simplified Formulas (12) and (13) as follows [21]:\npn(r) = E\u2217\n2 { Cnrn\u221a a2 \u2212 r2 \u2212 2r n \u03c0 a\u222b r x\u22122n dx\u221a x2 \u2212 r2 x\u222b 0 f \u2032\u2032n (\u03c1)\u03c1n+1 + f \u2032n(\u03c1)\u03c1n \u2212 n2 fn(\u03c1)\u03c1n\u22121\u221a x2 \u2212 \u03c12 d\u03c1 } . (14)\nHere, the constant Cn is given by the formulas\nC0 = 2 \u03c0\n( f0(0) + a a\u222b 0 f \u20320(\u03c1)d\u03c1\u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12 ) , (15)\nCn = 2 \u03c0\na1\u22122n a\u222b\n0\nf \u2032n(\u03c1)\u03c1n + n fn(\u03c1)\u03c1n\u22121\u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12 d\u03c1, n = 1, 2, . . . (16)\nWe note that, in light of (3) and (8)\u2013(10), we have f0(0) = \u03b40.\n2.4. Leonov\u2019s Closed-Form Solution\nLet \u2206 denote the two-dimensional Laplace differential operator, that is\n\u2206u(r, \u03d5) = \u22022u \u2202r2 + 1 r \u2202u \u2202r + 1 r2 \u22022u \u2202\u03d52 . (17)\nThe general solution to the governing integral Equation (7) in a closed form was first obtained by Leonov (1955). To simplify the writing of his formula, we introduce the notation\nR = \u221a r2 + \u03c12 \u2212 2r\u03c1 cos(\u03d5\u2212 \u03c8). (18)\nBy the definition, R equals the distance between the point of observation (r, \u03d5) and the point of integration (\u03c1, \u03c8).\nSo, according to Leonov, the general solution is given by the following formula [22]:\np(r, \u03d5) = \u2212 E \u2217\n2\u03c02 \u03c02 \u2206 2\u03c0\u222b 0 a\u222b 0 f (\u03c1, \u03c8) R \u03c1 d\u03c1d\u03c8\n+ 2\u03c0\u222b 0 a\u222b 0 f (\u03c1, \u03c8)\n[ 1\nR3\n( arctan \u221a a2 \u2212 r2 \u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12\naR \u2212 \u03c0 2\n)\n+ a R2 \u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12 \u221a a2 \u2212 r2\n] \u03c1 d\u03c1d\u03c8 . (19) We note that arctan(x)\u2212 \u03c0/2 = \u2212 arctan(1/x).\n2.5. Mossakovskii\u2019s Form of the General Solution\nStarting from the series solution (11)\u2013(13), Mossakovskii (1953) derived the following general solution in the following form [23]:\np(r, \u03d5) = \u2212 E \u2217\n2\u03c02 \u2206 2\u03c0\u222b 0 a\u222b 0 f (\u03c1, \u03c8) arctan (\u221a a2 \u2212 r2 \u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12 aR ) \u03c1 d\u03c1d\u03c8 R\n+ 2\u03c0\u222b 0 a\u222b 0 a f (\u03c1, \u03c8)\u221a (a2 \u2212 r2)3(a2 \u2212 \u03c12) (a4 \u2212 \u03c12r2)\u03c1 d\u03c1d\u03c8[ a4 \u2212 2a2r\u03c1 cos(\u03d5\u2212 \u03c8) + r2\u03c12 ] . (20)\nHere the same notation is used as introduced by Formulas (17) and (18). We note that arctan(x)\u2212 \u03c0/2 = \u2212 arctan(1/x).\n2.6. The Galin\u2013Mossakovskii General Solution\nWe recall that the zeroth term of the Fourier series (9) is defined by the formula\nf0(r) = 1\n2\u03c0 2\u03c0\u222b 0 f (r, \u03c8)d\u03c8. (21)\nAs a generalization of the general solution obtained by Galin [24], for the special case, when the contact pressure beneath the indenter is bounded, Mossakovskii (1953) derived the following formula [23]:\np(r, \u03d5) = E\u2217\n\u03c0 f0(0)\u221a a2 \u2212 r2\n+ E\u2217 2\u03c02 a\u221a\na2 \u2212 r2 2\u03c0\u222b 0 a\u222b 0 (a4 \u2212 \u03c12r2) \u2202 f \u2202\u03c1 (\u03c1, \u03c8) + 2a2r sin(\u03d5\u2212 \u03c8) \u2202 f \u2202\u03c8 (\u03c1, \u03c8)\u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12 [ a4 \u2212 2a2r\u03c1 cos(\u03d5\u2212 \u03c8) + r2\u03c12\n] d\u03c1d\u03c8 \u2212 E \u2217\n2\u03c02 2\u03c0\u222b 0 a\u222b 0 \u2206 f (\u03c1, \u03c8) arctan (\u221a a2 \u2212 r2 \u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12 aR ) \u03c1 d\u03c1d\u03c8 R . (22)\nWe note that, in view of (21), f0(r) gives the average value of the function f (r, \u03d5) on a circumference of radius r. That is why, if f (r, \u03d5) is a continuous function, then f0(0) coincides with the limit of f (r, \u03d5) as r \u2192 0.\n2.7. Fabrikant\u2019s General Solutions\nLet us introduce the notation\nL (k)g(\u03d5) = 1\n2\u03c0 2\u03c0\u222b 0 \u03bb(k, \u03d5\u2212 \u03c4)g(\u03c4)d\u03c4, (23)\nwhere\n\u03bb(k, \u03c4) = 1\u2212 k2\n1 + k2 \u2212 2k cos \u03c4 . (24)\nWe note that Formula (23) defines the L -operator [25] that acts on the function g(\u03d5), defined on a unit circle.\nMoreover, we put\n\u03b7 = 1 a (a2 \u2212 r2)1/2(a2 \u2212 \u03c12)1/2. (25)\nAccording to Fabrikant (1986), the general solution to the governing integral equation of the contact problem under consideration (7), in view of the notation (8), can be represented in the following closed form [25]:\np(r, \u03d5) = \u2212E \u2217\n\u03c0 1 r L (r) d dr a\u222b r x dx (x2 \u2212 r2)1/2 L ( 1 x2 ) d dx x\u222b 0 \u03c1 d\u03c1 (x2 \u2212 \u03c12)1/2 L (\u03c1) f (\u03c1, \u03d5). (26)\nAnother form of the Fabrikant solution is given by the following formula:\np(r, \u03d5) = E\u2217\n\u03c0 1 (a2 \u2212 r2)1/2 \u2202 \u2202a a\u222b 0 \u03c1 d\u03c1 (a2 \u2212 \u03c12)1/2 L ( r\u03c1 a2 ) f (\u03c1, \u03d5)\n\u2212 E \u2217\n2\u03c02 2\u03c0\u222b 0 a\u222b 0 1 R arctan ( \u03b7 R ) \u2206 f (\u03c1, \u03c8)\u03c1 d\u03c1d\u03c8. (27)\nYet, another form of the Fabrikant solution is given\np(r, \u03d5) = E\u2217 \u03c0a 1\u221a\na2 \u2212 r2 a\u222b 0 \u03c1 d\u03c1\u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12 d d\u03c1 [ \u03c1L ( r\u03c1 a2 ) f (\u03c1, \u03d5) ]\n\u2212 E \u2217\n2\u03c02 2\u03c0\u222b 0 d\u03c8 a\u222b 0 1 R arctan (\u221a a2 \u2212 r2 \u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12 aR ) \u2206 f (\u03c1, \u03c8)\u03c1 d\u03c1. (28)\nIt is pertinent to note here that in terms of the L operator, the Mossakovskii solution (20) can be represented as follows [26]:\np(r, \u03d5) = \u2212E \u2217\n\u03c0 \u2212\u2206 a\u222b\nr\ndx (x2 \u2212 r2)1/2 x\u222b 0 \u03c1 d\u03c1 (x2 \u2212 \u03c12)1/2 L ( r\u03c1 x2 ) f (\u03c1, \u03d5)\n+ a\n(a2 \u2212 r2)3/2 a\u222b 0 \u03c1 d\u03c1 (a2 \u2212 \u03c12)1/2 L ( r\u03c1 a2 ) f (\u03c1, \u03c8) . (29) We also note that, in view of (25), the last terms on the right-hand sides of Formulas (22)\nand (27) coincide."

Now, when comparing the closed-form solutions due to Leonov (19), Mossakovskii (20),\nand Fabrikant (26) with the Galin\u2013Mossakovskii solution (22) and the Fabrikant solutions (27) and (28), we conclude that only the latter three formulas allow to evaluate directly the contact pressure at the contact center.\nBy setting r = 0 in the Galin\u2013Mossakovskii formula (22), we readily obtain\np \u2223\u2223 r=0 = E\u2217 f0(0) \u03c0a + E\u2217 2\u03c02 2\u03c0\u222b 0 a\u222b 0 \u2202 f \u2202\u03c1 (\u03c1, \u03c8) d\u03c1d\u03c8\u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12\n\u2212 E \u2217\n2\u03c02 2\u03c0\u222b 0 a\u222b 0 \u2206 f (\u03c1, \u03c8) arctan (\u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12 \u03c1 ) d\u03c1d\u03c8. (33)\nBy taking into account (15) and (21), it can be easily verified that Formulas (32) and (33) are in complete agreement, and they can be rewritten as\np \u2223\u2223 r=0 = E\u2217\n\u03c0  f0(0)a + a\u222b\n0\nf \u20320(\u03c1)d\u03c1\u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12\n\u2212 a\u222b\n0\narccos (\u03c1\na\n) \u2206 f0(\u03c1)d\u03c1 , (34) where f0(r) is defined by Formula (21).\nNow, by setting r = 0 in the Fabrikant solution (27), we obtain\np \u2223\u2223 r=0 = E\u2217 2\u03c02 1 a \u2202 \u2202a a\u222b 0 \u03c1 d\u03c1\u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12 2\u03c0\u222b 0 f (\u03c1, \u03c8)d\u03c8\n\u2212 E \u2217\n2\u03c02 2\u03c0\u222b 0 a\u222b 0 arctan (\u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12 \u03c1 ) \u2206 f (\u03c1, \u03c8)d\u03c1d\u03c8. (35)\nHere the following formula is used (see Equations (23) and (24)):\nL (0) f (\u03c1, \u03d5) = 1\n2\u03c0 2\u03c0\u222b 0 f (\u03c1, \u03c4)d\u03c4. (36)\nThe first term on the right-hand side of Equation (35) can be simplified as follows:\n1 2\u03c0 \u2202 \u2202a 2\u03c0\u222b 0 a\u222b 0 f (\u03c1, \u03c8)\u03c1 d\u03c1d\u03c8\u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12 = \u2202 \u2202a a\u222b 0 f0(\u03c1) \u03c1 d\u03c1\u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12\n= \u2202\n\u2202a a f0(0) + a\u222b 0 f \u20320(\u03c1) \u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12 d\u03c1  (37) = f0(0) + a\na\u222b 0 f \u20320(\u03c1)d\u03c1\u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12 .\nThus, in view of (21) and (38), Formula (35) also completely agrees with Formula (34). Further, from the Fabrikant solution (28), in view of (21) and (36), it follows that\np \u2223\u2223 r=0 = E\u2217\n\u03c0a2 a\u222b 0 \u03c1\u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12 ( d d\u03c1 [ \u03c1 f0(\u03c1) ]) d\u03c1\n\u2212 E \u2217\n\u03c0 a\u222b 0 arctan (\u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12 \u03c1 ) \u2206 f0(\u03c1)d\u03c1, (38)\nand, taking into account the identity\na\u222b 0 \u03c1\u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12 ( d d\u03c1 [ \u03c1 f0(\u03c1) ]) d\u03c1 = a f0(0) + a2 a\u222b 0 f \u20320(\u03c1)d\u03c1\u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12 ,\nit is readily seen that Formula (38) is equivalent to Formula (34)."

A New Formula for the Contact SIF\nObserve that the general solutions (19) and (20) given by Leonov and Mossakovskii contain the application of the Laplace differential operator \u2206 to the double integral, and therefore, the direct usage of Formula (39) for evaluating the contact SIF is impossible. On the other hand, the Galin\u2013Mossakovskii solution (22) employs the operation of differentiation only under the integral sign. Let us assume that the function f (r, \u03d5) is twice continuously differentiable over the closed circle 0 \u2264 r \u2264 a, 0 \u2264 \u03d5 < 2\u03c0. Then, it can be shown (see Appendix A) that the third term on the right-hand side of Equation (22) is not singular at the contact contour. Hence, from Equations (22) and (39), it follows that\nKI(\u03d5) = \u2212 E\u2217 f0(0)\u221a \u03c0a \u2212 E \u2217\u221aa 2\u03c03/2 2\u03c0\u222b 0 a\u222b 0 (a2 \u2212 \u03c12)\u2202 f \u2202\u03c1 (\u03c1, \u03c8) + 2a sin(\u03d5\u2212 \u03c8) \u2202 f \u2202\u03c8 (\u03c1, \u03c8)\u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12 [ a2 \u2212 2a\u03c1 cos(\u03d5\u2212 \u03c8) + \u03c12\n] d\u03c1d\u03c8.

            "text": "First, we observe that all general solutions considered above make use of both the operations of integration and differentiation. From the computational point of view, it is preferable to avoid differentiating integrals with respect to parameters. That is why, Mossakovskii\u2019s series solution (14)\u2013(16) is, in this sense, better than Copson\u2019s series solution (12) and (13). Among the closed-form general solutions, a special interest represents the Galin\u2013 Mossakovskii solution (22), since all differentiations are performed under the integral sign. Moreover, in Formula (22), all operations of differentiation are applied directly to\nthe function f (r, \u03d5), and thus, are equivalent to differentiating the shape function of the punch \u03a6(r, \u03d5). Of note, Fabrikant\u2019s solutions (26), (27) and (28) are given by in terms of the L - operator, and their effective application requires the knowledge of its properties (for instance, L (k1)L (k2) = L (k1k2)). Another important point to note is the apparent singularity of the Leonov and Mossakovskii general solutions, as each of the terms on the right-hand sides of Equations (19) and (20), generally speaking, has a singularity of the order (a\u2212 r)\u22123/2 as r \u2192 a. At the same time, the sought-for solution of Equation (7), generally speaking, should possess the square root singularity, that is, the singularity of the order (a\u2212 r)\u22121/2 as r \u2192 a. This means that the higher-order singularity terms should cancel each other. It is necessary to note here that the general solutions outlined above hold true in a more general case of a transversely isotropic elastic half-space, provided that the plane of isotropy is parallel to the half-space surface (see, for example, [9]). The potential for further generalization and development of the general solutions presented above relies on the fact that the problem of elastic contact is a core issue in similar contact problems with a circular contact region for functionally graded [29,30], viscoelastic [31,32], thermoelastic [33,34], poroelastic [35,36], magneto-electro-elastic [37,38], multiferroic [39,40] semi-infinite media as well for elastic semi-infinite media with surface effects [41,42]. The main results of the present paper are given by Formulas (34) and (42), which in view of (8), can be rewritten as follows:\np \u2223\u2223 r=0 = E\u2217\n\u03c0  \u03b40a \u2212 a\u222b\n0\n\u03a6\u20320(\u03c1)d\u03c1\u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12 + a\u222b 0 arccos (\u03c1 a ) \u2206\u03a60(\u03c1)d\u03c1 , (43)\nKI(\u03d5) = \u2212 E\u2217\u03b40\u221a\n\u03c0a +\nE\u2217 \u221a\na 2\u03c03/2 2\u03c0\u222b 0 a\u222b 0 {\u221a a2 \u2212 \u03c12 \u2202\u03a6 \u2202\u03c1 (\u03c1, \u03c8)\n+ 2a sin(\u03d5\u2212 \u03c8)\u221a\na2 \u2212 \u03c12 \u2202\u03a6 \u2202\u03c8 (\u03c1, \u03c8)\n} d\u03c1d\u03c8[\na2 \u2212 2a\u03c1 cos(\u03d5\u2212 \u03c8) + \u03c12 ] . (44)\nHere, \u03a6\u20320(r) is the angle-averaged shape function, i.e.,\n\u03a60(r) = 1\n2\u03c0 2\u03c0\u222b 0 \u03a6(r, \u03c8)d\u03c8.\nIt is of interest to note that, in contrast to formulas due to Borodachev (40) and Fabrikant (41), Formula (44) separates the contributions to the contact SIF from the punch displacement \u03b40 and the punch shape function \u03a6(r, \u03d5). To the best of the author\u2019s knowledge, Formulas (43) and (44) have been reported in the literature for the first time.
