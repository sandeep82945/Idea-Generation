"Our experiments revealed that incorporating random contrasting leads to a more accurate and seamless scoring function, as compared to using only text and human-centric images. Our framework thus offers a promising approach to scale L&V models trained on large-scale image-text datasets for applications that involve interaction in the 3D world."
