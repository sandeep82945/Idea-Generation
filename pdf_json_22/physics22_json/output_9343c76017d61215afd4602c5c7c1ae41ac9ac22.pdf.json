            "text": "In several of our previous papers, we analysed, in the framework of symmetry methods, systems belonging to some subclasses of the following pde systems ut = Dx( f (u, v)ux) + g(u, v, ux),\nvt = h(u, v) (1)\nwith them in mind, generally, regarding models of population dynamics. With Dx, we denote the total differentiation with respect to x, while, usually, the subscripts denote the partial differentiations with respect to the indicated variables. Finally, in the following, the prime will denote the differentiation of functions with respect to their single argument. The first equation, an advection\u2013reaction\u2013diffusion equation, is obtained by introducing a Fick\u2013Fourier flux in the balance equation for the species of density u; the diffusion coefficient f could depend not only on u but also on density v [1,2], of a second species interacting with u. The function g may not always depend on the advection ux if the species u does not detect external stimuli (usually water currents or wind); this occurs in the swarming cells in the Proteus mirabilis colonies. The second equation is concerned with the species of density v that is assumed to be subject to neither diffusion nor advection, as, for instance, Proteus mirabilis [2\u20135] or mosquito models (Aedes Aegypt [6\u20139], Anopheles [10,11]), respectively, for swinging cells or the so-called aquatic populations. Here, we restrict ourselves to the subclass of phenomena modelled by the following partial differential equation system: ut = Dx( f (u)ux) + g(u, v, ux),\nvt = h(u, v), (2)\nwhere, in general, there is a population of mosquitos of density u interacting in more or less a weak manner with an aquatic population of density v. Moreover, analogous systems\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 2009. https://doi.org/10.3390/sym14102009 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry\ncould be found in several other fields, for instance, in the framework of the models dealing with chemotaxis [12,13]. The motivation of the Lie symmetry analysis approach is twofold. The first one, well known, is that the Lie symmetries offer a methodological way to derive exact solutions by reducing the number of dependent variables. The second one, not negligible, is that the discussion of the equation determining the symmetries could bring about requests for special forms of some constitutive functions in order to admit additional symmetries. This request, sometimes, creates an interesting feedback between the different constitutive parameters of the model and its sensitivity. In (2), the arbitrary functions f (u), g(u, v, ux), and h(u, v) appear. Once we have obtained the so-called determining system, we will obtain some restrictions for the coordinates of the symmetry generator, and three classifying equations involving the unknown coordinates and the arbitrary elements of the system. One equation involves only the function f and another one only the function h. The last condition is more complex, because it involves both f and g, having each different functional dependence. Therefore, we must introduce some simplifying constitutive assumptions. In the following, we consider some systems of the subclass (2) where, for the sake of simplicity, we assume\nf (u) \u2208 { f0, f0u},\nand g = A(u)ux + \u03a0(u) + \u0393(v),\nwith A(u) \u2208 {A0, A0u}, \u03a0(u) \u2208 {\u03b31u(\u03b32 \u2212 u), \u03b31u(\u03b32 \u2212 ln u)},\nwhile the constitutive functions \u0393(v) and h(u, v) remain free to perform a suitable classification with respect to them, which allows us to obtain additional symmetries. Once known, the classifying equations of (2) are obtained with arbitrary f , g, and h; by introducing some specializations of them, it is possible to ascertain the existence of extensions with respect to the principal Lie algebra LP [14] for some special form of the functions \u0393(v) and h(u, v). In this work, we analyse three systems of the type (2) and several classes of exact solutions are found. To the best of our knowledge, the literature regarding group analysis applications to similar systems is quite poor, so we believe that our results are new. The outline of the paper is the following. In Section 2, we write the determining system for the class (2) and we establish the principal Lie algebra. Systems with linear advection are studied in Section 3, while, in Section 4, we consider a system with diffusion and advection coefficients linear in u. Some remarks about the constitutive functions \u0393 and h are given in Section 5. Finally, in the last section, the conclusions are shown."

We recall that the following change in independent and dependent variables\n\u03c4 = t, z = x + At, u = u(\u03c4, z) v = v(\u03c4, z) (14)\nbrings the system (13) in the following form u\u03c4 = f0uzz + \u03a0(u) + \u0393(v),\nv\u03c4 = \u2212Avz + H(u, v). (15)\nWe can find the symmetry generator for the class (13) by solving (11) after having input the special forms of the functions f , g, and h. Taking into account that, for the system (13), f = f0, g = Aux + \u03a0(u) + \u0393(v), h = H(u, v), (16)\nthe conditions (11) become\n(2\u03b1\u2032 \u2212 \u03b2\u2032) f0 = 0, (17) \u2212 [ \u03c6uuu2x \u2212 (\u03b1\u2032\u2032 \u2212 2\u03c6xu)ux + \u03c6xx ] f 20 \u2212 \u03c8\u0393\u2032 f0 \u2212 \u03c6\u03a0\u2032 f0 +\n(\u03c6u \u2212 2\u03b1\u2032)(Aux + \u03a0(u) + \u0393(v)) f0 + \u03c6t f0 +( (\u03b1\u2032 \u2212 \u03c6u)ux \u2212 \u03c6x ) A f0 = 0, (18)(\n\u03c8v \u2212 \u03b2\u2032 ) H \u2212 \u03c6Hu \u2212 \u03c8Hv + \u03c8t = 0. (19)\nFrom (17), we have \u03b1(x) = c0 + c1x, \u03b2(t) = 2c1t + c2, (20)\nwhile, taking into account that no function depends on ux, from (18), we obtain\n\u03c6uu = 0, c1 A + 2\u03c6xu f0 = 0, (21) \u03c6xx f0 + \u03c8\u0393\u2032 + \u03c6\u03a0\u2032 + (2c1 \u2212 \u03c6u)(\u03a0 + \u0393)\u2212 \u03c6t + \u03c6x A = 0. (22)\nFrom conditions (21), it follows that\n\u03c6(x, t, u) = u (\n\u03c61(t)\u2212 c1 Ax 2 f0\n) + \u03c62(x, t). (23)\nIn the condition (22), the arbitrary elements \u03a0(u) and \u0393(v) appear. We study (13) by specializing \u03a0(u) in these two special forms\n\u03a0(u) = \u03b31u(\u03b32 \u2212 u), \u03a0(u) = \u03b31u(\u03b32 \u2212 ln u).\n3.1. Logistic u- Production\nA typical choice for the function \u03a0(u) is given by the logistic form\n\u03a0(u) = \u03b31u(\u03b32 \u2212 u), (24)\nbut taking into account (23) and this form of \u03a0(u), from the condition (22), we obtain\nc1 = 0, \u03c61(t) = 0, \u03c62(x, t) = 0, \u03c8(x, t, v) = 0, (25)\ni.e., extensions of the principal Lie algebra do not exist. Thus, we look for invariant solutions of the system ut = f0uxx + Aux + \u03b31u(\u03b32 \u2212 u) + \u0393(v),\nvt = H(u, v). (26)\nBy using the generator X = c1X1 + c2X2, (27)\nthe solutions are u = U(\u03c3), v = V(\u03c3),\nwhere \u03c3 = c2x\u2212 c1t, and with U and V solutions of the following reduced system c1U\u2032 + f0U\u2032\u2032 + c2 AU\u2032 + \u03b31U(\u03b32 \u2212U) + \u0393(V) = 0,\ncV\u2032 = H(U, V). (28)\nIf we specialize\n\u0393(v) = \u03b32v, h(u, v) = \u03b32v\u2212 \u03b33\n\u03b32 (u\u2212 2\u03b30),\nthe previous reduced system becomes c1U\u2032 + f0U\u2032\u2032 + c2 AU\u2032 + \u03b31U(\u03b32 \u2212U)\u2212 \u03b32V = 0,\ncV\u2032 = (V \u2212 \u03b33\u03b32 )(U \u2212 2\u03b30). (29)\nIf U = 2\u03b30, V must be constant too and we obtain V = 2\u03b30\u03b31 ( \u03b32 \u2212 2\u03b30\u03b32 ) . Instead, if V = \u03b33 \u03b32 , then U must satisfy the following autonomous equation:\nf0U\u2032\u2032 + (c1 + c2 A)U\u2032 + \u03b31U(\u03b32 \u2212U) + \u03b33 = 0. (30)\nAfter having performed the substitution Z(U) = U\u2032, equation (30) becomes the following Abel equation of the second kind in the canonical form [23,24]:\nf0ZZ\u2032 + (c1 + c2 A)Z + \u03b31U(\u03b32 \u2212U) + \u03b33 = 0. (31)\nFrom this, after a suitable choice of arbitrary constants c1 and c2, we obtain the following separable variable equation:\nf0ZZ\u2032 + \u03b31U(\u03b32 \u2212U) + \u03b33 = 0. (32)\n3.2. Log-Logistic u- Production\nIf we want to obtain some extensions of the principal Lie algebra but at the same time a form of \u03a0(u) with the characteristics of the logistic form, we can choose\n\u03a0(u) = \u03b31u(\u03b32 \u2212 ln u). (33)\nThen, we consider  ut = f0uxx + Aux + \u03b31u(\u03b32 \u2212 ln u) + \u0393(v),\nvt = H(u, v). (34)\nWe recall that for the system (13), we have already obtained\n\u03b1(x) = c0 + c1x, \u03b2(t) = 2c1t + c2, \u03c6(x, t, u) = u (\n\u03c61(t)\u2212 c1 Ax 2 f0\n) + \u03c62(x, t), (35)\nand the following conditions\n(Ac1x + 4c1 f0 \u2212 2 f0\u03c61)(\u03a0 + \u0393) + (2\u03c62 f0 + 2\u03c61u f0 \u2212 Auc1x)\u03a0\u2032 + 2A\u03c62x f0 \u2212 (A 2c1 + 2\u03c6\u20321 f0)u + \u03c62xx f 2 0 + 2\u03c8\u0393\n\u2032 f0 \u2212 2\u03c62t f0 = 0, (36)( \u03c8v \u2212 \u03b2\u2032 ) H \u2212 ( u (\n\u03c61 \u2212 c1 Ax 2 f0\n) + \u03c62 ) Hu \u2212 \u03c8Hv + \u03c8t = 0. (37)\nSubstituting (33), the condition (36) reads\n(Ac1\u03b31x + 4c1\u03b31\u03b32 f0 \u2212 A2c1 \u2212 2 f0\u03b31\u03c61 \u2212 2\u03c6\u20321 f0)U \u2212 4c1 f0\u03b31u ln u + \u22122\u03c62 f0\u03b31 ln u + Ac1x\u0393 + 2\u03c62 f0\u03b31\u03b32 + 2A\u03c62x f0 + 2\u03c62xx f 2 0 +\n\u22122\u03c62 f0\u03b31 \u2212 2\u03c61\u0393 f0 + 2\u03c8\u0393\u2032 f0 + 4c1 f0\u0393\u2212 2\u03c62t f0 = 0. (38)\nTaking into account that in the condition (38), no function depends on u, we obtain\nc1 = 0, \u03b31\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c6\u20321 = 0, \u03c62 = 0, \u03c61\u0393 f0 \u2212 \u03c8\u0393\u2032 f0 + \u03c62t f0 = 0, (39)\ni.e.,\n\u03c61 = c3e\u2212\u03b31t, \u03c8 = c3 e\u2212\u03b31 \u0393\n\u0393\u2032 . (40)\nFinally, by substituting these results into the condition (37), it becomes\nc3e\u2212\u03b31t [ (Huu\u2212 H)\u0393\u20322 + (Hv + \u03b31)\u0393\u0393\u2032 + h\u0393\u0393\u2032\u2032 ] = 0. (41)\nWe obtain the following extension of LP\nX3 = e\u2212\u03b31t (\nu\u2202u + \u0393 \u0393\u2032 \u2202v\n) (42)\nonly when\nH(u, v) = (\u03a6(\u03c9)\u2212 \u03b31 ln \u0393) \u0393 \u0393\u2032\n(43)\nwith \u03c9 = u \u0393 .\nRemark 2. We obtain the same result even if A = 0, i.e., without advection.\nIf we use the generator\nX = c1X2 + c2X1 + c3X3, (44)\nwith c1 6= 0, the invariant solutions are\nu(t, x) = e\u2212 c3 c1\u03b31 e\u2212\u03b31t U(\u03c3),\n\u0393(v(t, x))) = e\u2212 c3 c1\u03b31 e\u2212\u03b31t V(\u03c3),\n(45)\nwhere \u03c3 = c1x\u2212 c2t. The functions U and V are solutions of the reduced system \u2212c2U\u2032 = c21 f0U\u2032\u2032 + c1 AU\u2032 + \u03b31U(\u03b32 \u2212 ln U) + V, \u2212c2V\u2032 = ( \u03a6 ( U V ) \u2212 \u03b31 ln V ) V.\n(46)\nIn order to have a reduced system of the first order, we use the generator\nX = c2X1 + c3X3, (47)\nwith c2 6= 0. In this case, the invariant solutions are\nu(t, x) = e c3 c2 xe\u2212\u03b31t U(t),\n\u0393(v(t, x))) = e c3 c2 xe\u2212\u03b31t V(t).\n(48)\nThe functions U and V are solutions of the reduced system U\u2032 = c 2 3 c22 e\u22122\u03b31t f0U + c3 c2 e\u2212\u03b31t AU + \u03b31U(\u03b32 \u2212 ln U) + V, V\u2032 = ( \u03a6 (\nU V ) \u2212 \u03b31 ln V ) V.\n(49)\nIn this case, if we consider\n\u03a6 (\nU V\n) = p0 + p1\nV U + p2 \u221a V\u221a U\n+ p3 ln (\nU V\n) , (50)\nwe can look for solutions of type\nU(t) = u0e f1(t) and V(t) = v0e\u22122\u03b31 e f1(t). (51)\nIf we take p0 = \u03b31(\u03b32 \u2212 2),\np1 = f0u20 p 2 2\nA2v20 \u2212 1,\np3 = \u2212\u03b31,\n(52)\nby choosing\nc2 = A \u221a v0c3\u221a (u0)p2 , (53)\nwe obtain f1(t) = \u03b32 \u2212 ln(u0) + (\u221a\nu0\u221a v0\np2t + k ) e\u2212\u03b31t \u2212 A2v20 + f0 p 2 2u 2 0\nA2\u03b31u0v0 e\u22122\u03b31t, (54)\nwith k arbitrary constant. Once we have obtained U(t) and V(t), from (48), we obtain directly u(t, x). To find v(t, x), we must invert the assigned function \u0393 (numerically or analytically)."

            "text": "In this paper, we continue our studies dealing with the extension of the principal Lie algebra and with our search for solutions of some subclasses of systems (2), begun in [7] and recently continued in [26,27]. In all the cases analysed here, a priori, we have considered the two constitutive functions of production \u0393(v) and h(u, v) arbitrary in order to obtain a classification with respect to each of them. In the case of linear advection, we obtain, for \u03a0(u) = \u03b31u(\u03b32 \u2212 ln u), the extension by one of LP that leaves \u0393(v) arbitrary while h is, as expected as a solution of a PDE, an arbitrary function depending on \u03c9 =\nu \u0393 . For special forms of h, wide classes of exact\nsolutions are derived. We remark that, in this case, the function \u03a0(u) has the same numerical features, at least in a suitable interval, of the classical logistic form \u03a0(u) = \u03b31u(\u03b32 \u2212 u) for which we do not obtain extensions. For this form of \u03a0(u), however, looking for travelling wave solutions, in some cases, we bring the reduced system, with appropriate transformations, to an Abel equation. For the same system without advection, we obtained additional extensions in [27]. In the system analysed in Section 4, we assumed diffusion and advection coefficients both linear in u. Additionally, in this case, we obtain extensions with \u0393 arbitrary, while H is still dependent on an arbitrary function \u03a6(\u03c9) with \u03c9 =\nu\u221a \u0393 . For an appropriate choice of\n\u03a6(\u03c9), classes of exact solutions are derived.\nAuthor Contributions: M.T. and R.T. contributed equally to this work.
