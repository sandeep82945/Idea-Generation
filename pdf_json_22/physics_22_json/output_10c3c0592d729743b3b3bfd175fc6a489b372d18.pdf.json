    "abstractText": "We present a dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation study on the surface modification of initiator embedded microparticles (MPs) of different shapes via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) brush growth. The surface-initiated ATRP-brush growth leads to the formation of a more globular MP shape. We perform the comparative analysis of ATRPbrush growth on three different forms of particle surfaces: cup surface, spherical surface, and flat surface (rectangular/disk-shaped). First, we establish the chemical kinetics of the brush growth: the monomer conversion and the reaction rates. We next argue the structure changes (shape-modification) of brush-modified surfaces by computing the radial distribution function, spatial density distribution, radius of gyration, hydrodynamic radius, and shape factor. The polymer brush-modified particles are well known as the carrier materials for enzyme immobilization. Finally, we study the biopolymer adsorption on ATRP-brush modified particles in a compatible solution. In particular, we explore the effect of ATRP-brush length, biopolymer chain length, and concentration on the adsorption process. Our results illustrate the enhanced biopolymer adsorption with increased brush length, initiator concentration, and biopolymer concentration. Most importantly, the flat surface loads more biopolymers than the other two surfaces when adsorption reaches saturation. The experimental results verified the same, considering the disk-shaped flat surface particle, cup, and spherical particles.",

The surface-initiated ATRP-brush growth leads\nto the formation of a more globular MP shape. We perform the comparative analysis of ATRP-\nbrush growth on three different forms of particle surfaces: cup surface, spherical surface, and\nflat surface (rectangular/disk-shaped). First, we establish the chemical kinetics of the brush\ngrowth: the monomer conversion and the reaction rates. We next argue the structure changes\n(shape-modification) of brush-modified surfaces by computing the radial distribution function,\nspatial density distribution, radius of gyration, hydrodynamic radius, and shape factor. The\npolymer brush-modified particles are well known as the carrier materials for enzyme\nimmobilization. Finally, we study the biopolymer adsorption on ATRP-brush modified\nparticles in a compatible solution. In particular, we explore the effect of ATRP-brush length,\nbiopolymer chain length, and concentration on the adsorption process. Our results illustrate the\nenhanced biopolymer adsorption with increased brush length, initiator concentration, and\nbiopolymer concentration. Most importantly, the flat surface loads more biopolymers than the\nother two surfaces when adsorption reaches saturation.

            "text": "The structural modification of MPs is gaining immense attention in the biomedical field (mainly in targeted drug/cell delivery, self-assembly, diagnostics)1\u20134 due to their enormous\napplications. Recent studies show that MP\u2019s structure and shape significantly influence physiological interactions such as margination, circular half-life, and opsonization.5\u20138 Apart\nfrom the extensively used spherical MPs, a noticeable rise has also been observed in MPs of\nvarious other shapes such as cup, disc, rod, tube, and ellipsoid as an emerging controlled drug\ndelivery system.9\u201312 Therefore, a controlled surface modification of the particles could be highly crucial to several biomedical applications.13\u201317 There are numerous reports\ndemonstrating the importance of surface modification of MPs such as polymeric cup-shaped particles using various techniques such as solvent evaporation,18 vapor deposition,19 miniemulsion,20,21 microfluidics.22\nOut of numerous applications of surface-modified particles, the immobilization of\nbiopolymers (e.g., enzymes) has been getting enormous attention in the last decade due to its use in biocatalysts, food processing, drug, and textile manufacturing, biosensors, and so on.23\u2013 25 This inspired researchers to find a better solution to utilize biopolymers more efficiently to expand their applications.16,26\u201329 Further, the immobilization of biopolymers to insoluble solid\nparticles has enhanced the rapid arrest and controlled quenching of reaction kinetics. This is\nbecause of a comparatively more straightforward extraction of solid surface-bound biopolymers from the solution.16,26\u201334 Thus, this immobilization process improves the stability\nand reusability of biopolymers against the change in pH, solvent, and temperature over successive chemical reactions.35\u201337 The immobilization of biopolymers on solid surfaces has significant medical and industrial applications.35 Additionally, surface-modified solid particles\nwith polyelectrolyte ATRP-brush (e.g., poly(DMAEMA) can immobilize a considerable\namount of biopolymer through electrostatic adsorption in their brush morphology due to the high charge density.37\u201339 Thus, brush-modified surfaces proved fascinating in immobilizing biopolymers due to their unique structures.36,37\nIfra and co-workers have recently illustrated differently-shaped MP modifications using the electrojetting technique.14\u201316 In particular, different MPs are prepared from a blend of\npolylactide (PLA) and poly[methylmethacrylate-co-2-(2-bromopropionyloxy) ethyl methacrylate] (poly(MMA-co-BEMA)) in 3:1 ratio.14 To fabricate the surface,\npoly(DMAEMA) brushes are synthesized via grafting from approach at the initiator (BEMA molecule) embedded surfaces via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP)14\u201316 with\nDMAEMA monomer in the water (\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc3b \u22cd 7). The brush grafting density is regulated by\naltering the initiator concentration on the surfaces. The polymerization time yields ATRP\nbrushes of different lengths and thus controls surface charge at the fabricated surface. Thus,\nthe efficiency of electrostatic adsorption of biopolymer (\ud835\udefc-Glucosidase) onto the surface of a brush-modified particle gets enhanced.16,36,37\nTo understand the experimental findings by Ifra and co-workers16, we present a DPD\nsimulation study to gain further insights into the underlying physical phenomena at the atomic level. In DPD, the system evolution follows Newton\u2019s equation of motion.40\u201343 Advantage of\nusing the DPD technique is well-known for preserving the hydrodynamic behavior of modeled\npolymeric solutions, melts, and biopolymers in crowded and confined environments, which is crucial to estimating the system\u2019s dynamic behavior.44,45 Hence, it is proved to be a very effective particle (DPD bead) simulation technique.40,41 DPD is used extensively to model\nvarious types of free radical polymerization processes, and the effect of shape and size on the dynamics of the complex soft materials.42,43\nThis contribution presents a generic DPD model focusing on surface fabrication via surface-\ninitiated ATRP-brush growth at differently-shaped MPs (such as the cup, sphere, and\nrectangular) surfaces and biopolymer adsorption occurring at these modified surfaces. Our\nsimulation demonstrates a comparative study by varying the percentage of initiator\nconcentration and polymerization time to vary the brush density and brush length and their effect on biopolymer adsorption. Further, we correlate them with the experimental findings.15,16\nThe biopolymer is modeled as a linear free-rotating chain of soft beads connected by harmonic bonds.42,43\nWe organize this paper as follows. First, in section 2, we describe the computational model\ndetails and simulation parameters of the system. Then, section 3.1 discusses the results obtained\nfor brush growth from the initiators implanted at the three different surfaces via surface-\ninitiated ATRP in the solvent. Further, we discuss the biopolymer adsorption at the brush\nmodified cup surface (CS), spherical surface (SS), and flat rectangular surface (RS) particles\nfor various biopolymer concentrations in the solution. Next, section 3.2 presents the\nexperimental results of CS, SS, disk surface modification, and biopolymer adsorption. Finally,\nin section 4, we conclude the paper with a summary."

The noise amplitude \ud835\udf09\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 in Eq.

The symmetry relation \ud835\udf09\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 = \ud835\udf09\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc56 and the forces, ?\u20d7?\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc37 and ?\u20d7?\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc45 act along the line\nof bead centers, ensuring momentum conservation. For a correct canonical equilibrium state, the dissipative and random forces are coupled with the following relations:40,41 \ud835\udf0e2 = 2\ud835\udefe\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc47, and \ud835\udf14\ud835\udc37(\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57) = \ud835\udf14\ud835\udc45(\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57) 2 = (1 \u2212 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc50\u2044 ) \ud835\udc60 for \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 < \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc50 where \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc35 is the Boltzmann constant, and \ud835\udc47 is the equilibrium temperature of the system. Here, we took the traditional weight function\nexponent \ud835\udc60 = 2. However, other choices are also allowed if the above two conditions are fulfilled.49,51 Overall, the notable advantage of the DPD approach is that the pairwise forces\nshown in Eqs. (2-4), conserves the momentum locally, thus upholding the correct hydrodynamic52 behavior with only a few hundred particles.40,41\nWe set the interaction parameter between the compatible beads, \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 = 25 (in reduced\nDPD units). This choice is based on the compressibility of water by coarse-graining ten water molecules into one bead.40 In general, for any two incompatible beads, we set \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 = 60. 43 We provide the other \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 values in a short while. The parameters \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc50, \ud835\udc5a, and \ud835\udc47 are set to 1.0 and \ud835\udefe = 4.5 in reduced DPD units. The typical energy scale of the model is set by \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc47. 40,53 We use the modified velocity-verlet algorithm to integrate the equations of motion.40,54 The simulation time step is set to \u0394\ud835\udc61 = 0.02\ud835\udf0f where \ud835\udf0f = (\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc50 2 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc47\u2044 ) 1 2\u2044 is defined as the characteristic time scale. The total bead number density in the simulation box is set to \ud835\udf0c = 3, which is a reasonable choice for DPD simulation of liquids.40,41 The above choices of coarse-graining yield the dimensional values of length \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc50 \u2248 0.97 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5a, and time \ud835\udf0f \u2248 8.3 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc60. 55,56\nWe simulate the polymer chains as a bead-spring model56 where the harmonic bond\npotential \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4f = 1 2\u2044 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4f(\ud835\udc5f \u2212 \ud835\udc5f0) 2 connects neighboring DPD beads of the chain. Here \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4f = 128 is the elastic bond strength, and \ud835\udc5f0 = 0.5 is the equilibrium bond distance. 57 The angle potential \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc4e = 1 2\u2044 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4e(cos \ud835\udf03 \u2212 cos \ud835\udf030) 2 provides the polymer chain stiffness. We set the potential strength \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4e = 5, and the equilibrium angle \ud835\udf030 = 180 degrees; 56\u201358 \ud835\udf03 denotes the angle between two successive bonds along a polymer chain.\n2.2 Modeling the nanoparticles. In the framework of DPD simulation, we model the\ndifferently shaped MPs (CS, SS, and RS) as rigid bodies. Therefore, the forces and torques\nacting on rigid MPs are computed as the sum of all the forces and torques on constituent DPD\nbeads. The particles are made of PLA blended with poly(MMA-co-BEMA) in a 3: 1 ratio, as described in the experiments,16. The poly(BEMA) compound acts as an initiator to instigate\nthe ATRP process with DMAEMA monomers available in the solution to fabricate the surface.\nThe cup (half-sphere) and spherical-shaped MPs are composed of double-layered DPD beads arranged on the vertices of a geodesic grid generated by subdividing an icosahedron.59 The\ninner and outer radii are set to \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b = 7.7\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc50, \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc5c = 8.0\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc50. The cup-shaped MP contains \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc60 = 1962 beads (\ud835\udf19\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc60 = 5.23 \u00d7 10 \u22123) and the spherical-shaped MP comprise \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 = 3924 beads (\ud835\udf19\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 = 1.04 \u00d7 10 \u22122). The rectangle-shaped MP surface is also modeled as a double-layered flat structure with \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc60 = 1960 beads (\ud835\udf19\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc60 = 5.23 \u00d7 10 \u22123) arranged in a regular lattice structure with a lattice constant of 0.5\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc50. Each layer contains an equal number of beads. The rectangular MP size is 17.5\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc50 \u00d7 14\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc50 (in reduced DPD units) with \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc67 = 0.5\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc50 dimensionless unit in thickness. The number density of beads is kept sufficiently high (\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc5a~ 11) in each layer of CS, SS, and RS to prevent the penetration of ATRP-brush and other beads.\nThe experimental studies14\u201316 illustrated that only a fraction of poly(BEMA) molecules\non the MP\u2019s surface act as initiators in the solution. Our simulation models this experimental\nobservation by considering a certain fraction of MP beads as the initiator beads. Furthermore,\nwe chose the initiator beads randomly at either particle surface for the CS and RS, whereas for\nSS, they are selected only on the outer surface. Note that the flat surface is a disk-shaped\nparticle in the experiment, whereas we model it as a rectangular-shaped particle in the\nsimulation. We considered three initiator values: \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56 = 20, 50, and 100, i.e., 1%, 2.5%, and 5% of MP beads, respectively; corresponding volume fractions are \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc56 = 5.3 \u00d7 10 \u22125, 1.33 \u00d7 10\u22124, and 2.66 \u00d7 10\u22124. Thus, polymer brushes (\ud835\udc35) will grow from the surface during polymerization. The MPs are insoluble in the solvent (\ud835\udc60),16 we set their interaction with the\nsolvent \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc60 = 45. To model the fact that the interaction between MP bead (\ud835\udc5a) and monomer bead (\ud835\udc40) is slightly incompatible, we set \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc40 = 35, and its interaction with the polymer brush is set as \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc35 = 35.\n2.3 Surface fabrication of microparticles via ATRP-brush. To simulate ATRP-brush\ngrowth, we exploit the recently developed DPD approach for living radical polymerization, where a set of relevant elemental reactions model the ATRP processes.42,43,60 The elements\ninvolved in ATRP are initiator and monomer; all are modeled as DPD beads. The main reaction\nsteps are the initiation and propagation of monomers in the explicitly considered solvent beads.\nThe polymerization in our approach is similar to the earlier modeled via coarse-grained\nMD and MC simulations.61,62 Herein, we picked the monomer volume fraction, \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc40 = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22121 (\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc40 = 37500) to grow up the polymer brush. We randomly selected initiator beads to begin the ATRP reactions. In each reaction step, we randomly select monomer beads within the interaction radius, \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56 = 0.7\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc50 of each initiator bead. 42,43 The selected bead pair will form a covalent bond with the polymerization probability 0 < \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc65 < 1, where superscript \ud835\udc65 stands for the type of chemical reaction; \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc56 for the initiation, and \ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc40 for the propagation with monomers.63,64 Next, we draw a random number \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5f \u2208 (0,1) from a uniform distribution and compare it with the reaction probability \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc65. The covalent bond formation reaction step is accepted when \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5f < \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc65, otherwise rejected. Thus, each successful reaction step yields an irreversible covalent bond represented by the harmonic bond potential with \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4f = 128, \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4e = 5, and \ud835\udf030 = 180 (in reduced DPD unit).\nIn our simulation, we set the initiation probability \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc56 = 0.5, and the chain propagation\nprobability \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc40 = 0.05.42,63,64 The respective reaction rate constants can be adjusted efficiently by selecting different values of \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc65. Nevertheless, lower \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc65 values are chosen to\nensure kinetically controlled polymerization. The stated value of \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56 is chosen to reproduce the expected linear first-order kinetics for living radical polymerization. Any smaller values delay the brush growth, and higher values significantly deviate from the linear first-order kinetics.43\nWe exclude the degenerative chain transfer and the termination reaction of active radicals to dormant species in ATRP due to the characteristics of living polymerization.65,66 The details of\nbead types involved in the primary reaction steps are summarized via a schematic shown in\nFig. 1. Since the characteristic simulation time step is set to \u0394\ud835\udc61 = 0.02\ud835\udf0f, and the reaction time interval between any two successive reaction steps is selected to be \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc5f = 0.2\ud835\udf0f, 42,67 the reactions are performed every ten simulation time steps.42\nThe monomer and ATRP-brush beads are considered hydrophilic (compatible) with\nsolvent beads, and hence, their interaction parameters are set to \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc60 = \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc60 = 25 (in DPD units). Similarly, for monomer and brush (polymerized monomer) bead interaction, \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc35 = 25. The experimental results14,15 suggest that in a pure solvent (water at \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc3b \u2248 7),\npoly(DMAEMA) brushes are positively charged due to protonated amino groups present in the\nbrush. However, the explicit use of charge distribution and corresponding electrostatic forces in the DPD simulation approach of biological systems is rare.68\u201370 Due to the charge screening,\nelectrostatic interaction becomes short-range. Therefore, to incorporate the effect of repulsive\ninteraction between the brush beads carrying positive charges, we choose \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35 = 27.\n2.3 Biopolymer adsorption at the fabricated nanoparticle surface. We modeled the\nbiopolymer (\ud835\udefc-glucosidase enzyme) in the same way as the brush chain- a linear chain of \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc4f DPD beads, connected by harmonic bonds with an elastic constant \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4f = 128, and equilibrium bond distance \ud835\udc5f0 = 0.5. 71 The angle potential coefficient between two consecutive bonds along with the biopolymer chain \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4e = 5, and \ud835\udf030 = 180 is an equilibrium angle between the successive bonds. The mass of each biopolymer bead is set to 1.0 in the reduced DPD unit. We study biopolymer adsorption for three different concentrations: \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4f = 2%\ud835\udc41 (\ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f = 2.0 \u00d7 10 \u22122), 4%\ud835\udc41 (\ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f = 4.0 \u00d7 10 \u22122), and 8%\ud835\udc41 (\ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f = 8.0 \u00d7 10 \u22122). The corresponding number of DPD beads are \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc4f = 7500, 15000, and 30000, respectively. To study the effect of biopolymer length (\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4f) on the adsorption at fabricated surfaces, we choose \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4f = 25, 10, and 1. The biopolymer (\ud835\udefc-glucosidase16) is chemically compatible with the solvent and negatively\ncharged molecule. Therefore, the positively charged brush beads will attract the negatively\ncharged biopolymers. Thus, to incorporate this favorable interaction, we set the interaction\nparameters between these beads, \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc4f = 15, and between the biopolymer beads, \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f = 27.\nWe consider a simulation box of size 50\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc50 \u00d7 50\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc50 \u00d7 50\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc50. The total number density in the\nbox is fixed at \ud835\udf0c = 3\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc50 \u22123 (i.e., \ud835\udc41 = 375000 beads).40\u201343 The periodic boundary conditions are applied in the \ud835\udc65- and \ud835\udc66-directions. In contrast, the simulation box in the transverse \ud835\udc67-direction is bounded by amorphous solid walls.42 The height of both walls is fixed to \u210e = 1, and bead density is set \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc64 = 3 (volume fraction, \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc64 = 4.0 \u00d7 10 \u22122). In addition, we apply bounce-back boundary conditions at the fluid-wall interface72 to inhibit the penetration of solvent, moieties, and polymer brush beads into the walls.73 We consider repulsive interaction (\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc57 = 60) between wall beads and other beads in the system. The solvent volume fraction in our simulation box is held fixed to \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc60 \u2248 8.3 \u00d7 10 \u22121 (for \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f = 2.0 \u00d7 10 \u22122), 8.1 \u00d7 10\u22121 (for \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f = 4.0 \u00d7 10\u22122), and 7.7 \u00d7 10\u22121 (for \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f = 8.0 \u00d7 10 \u22122). The interaction parameters for all DPD beads are summarized in Table 1.\nTo start the DPD simulation, we place the microparticle in a simulation box and generate\nthe initial configuration of monomer and solvent by randomly placing them in the box. Then, we equilibrate the system for \ud835\udc61 = 1 \u00d7 105 simulation time steps, and allow the polymerization\nreactions to begin. First, we let the ATRP brush grow up to three different time steps: \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3a = 400, 800, and 1500 to get the fabricated MP surface with varying brush lengths. Next, we\nintroduced the biopolymers in the solution containing fabricated MPs and observed the\nbiopolymer adsorption up to \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 = 3000 simulation time steps. 3. Results and discussion\n3.1. Simulation Study\nWe utilize the DPD simulation approach to study the biopolymer adsorption at ATRP-\nbrush modified different-shaped MPs such as cup, spherical, and rectangular surfaces. To begin\nwith, first, we study the surface modification of a cup particle where initiators are equally\ndistributed at the inner and outer surfaces. Three initiator percentages \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 = 1%, 2.5%, 5% of \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc60 are considered to differentiate its effect on surface fabrication. We allow the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) reaction to begin with monomers in the solution. To analyze\nthe polymerization kinetics, we plot the monomer conversion (Conv\ud835\udc40 = [\ud835\udc40]\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61/[\ud835\udc40]0) and the reaction rate, log ([\ud835\udc40]0 [\ud835\udc40]\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\u2044 ) as a function of time (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3a) in Fig. 2, where [\ud835\udc40]0 denotes the initial monomer concentration, [\ud835\udc40]\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61 and [\ud835\udc40]\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61 indicate the reacted and unreacted monomer concentration, respectively, at \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3a . The polymerization is allowed up to \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3a = 1500 for all three initiator concentrations. As illustrated in Fig. 2(a), with an increase in \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56, Conv\ud835\udc40 increases linearly, which yielded nearly 6% conversion for \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 = 1% (black curve), 13% conversion for \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 = 2.5% (red curve), and 21% conversion for \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 = 5% (green curve) within the given\nsimulation time. Figure 2(a) demonstrates that, in ATRP, polymer chains grow linearly with\nthe monomer conversion. Thus, a higher monomer conversion corresponds to a longer brush\nlength.\nThe reaction rate, log ([\ud835\udc40]0 [\ud835\udc40]\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\u2044 ) is also varying linearly for all \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 values illustrated in\nFig. 2(b). Thus, confirming the first-order reaction kinetics of ATRP, as expected for a\nliving/controlled polymerization with constant free radical concentrations during the reaction process.42,63,64 Figures 2(c-e) show the snapshots of fabricated CS for the ATRP-brush growth\ntill \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3a = 1500 at different initiator concentrations. Figures 2(f-h) display brush density variation around CS in the \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66-plane at \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc67 = 25 corresponding to Figs. 2(c-e). The yellow circle shows the crosssection of CS, and the red region displays the ATRP-brush density. These\nsnapshots clarify that the brush density is higher for higher monomer conversion (~21%) for\n\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 = 5.0% at CS. The presence of the red region within CS (yellow circle) also confirms the initiators\u2019 presence at the inner surface of CS.\nThe two most frequently used physical parameters that characterize the size of a\nmacromolecule are the radius of gyration (\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc54) and hydrodynamic radius (\ud835\udc45\u210e). Both \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc54 and \ud835\udc45\u210e used different ways to compute the size of a macromolecule and arrive at a similar conclusion.\nWe calculate the radius of gyration74,75 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc54 = ( 1\n\ud835\udc41 \u2211 \u27e8\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\n2\u27e9\ud835\udc56 ) 1/2 as a function of time \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3a for \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 =\n1.0%, 2.5%, and 5.0%, as displayed by the black, red, and green curves in Fig. 3(a). Here \ud835\udc41 denotes the total number of CS and brush beads, and \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56 represents the distance of \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc61\u210e bead from the center of mass of CS and brush beads. The angular brackets signify the averaging over five\nensembles. The plots in Fig. 3(a) show that brush fabricated cup particle size increases with\ntime as the degree of polymerization (Conv\ud835\udc40) increases for all \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56. However, Conv\ud835\udc40 is more for higher \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 (= 5.0%) at a set duration of polymerization. Hence, the larger values of \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc54 is observed as a function of time (see the curves in Fig. 3(a)).\nNote that in ATRP, one monomer adds up at a time to a growing chain (i.e., the\npropagation rate is the same for each initiator). Consequently, the growing chains are nearly monodispersed.62,64\u201366 Therefore, at a given monomer concentration, the individual chain\nlength (degree of polymerization) is longer for a low initiator concentration for any given time\nduring the polymerization. Thus, from the results shown in Fig. 2, the estimated individual\nbrush length is \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc35 \u2243 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5f0 where \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc35 \u2243 115, 100, and 86 are roughly the number of polymerized beads per brush chain for \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 = 1.0%, 2.5%, and 5.0%, respectively, at \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3a = 1500. Given the fact that polymer brushes are repulsive with CS (\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc35 = 35) and also with themselves (\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35 = 27) due to positively charged DPD beads, the ATRP-brushes are more\nswollen and thus relatively more extended in the solvent for \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 = 5.0% than for \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 = 1.0% and hence, higher \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc54 is observed.\nWe compute \ud835\udc45\u210e to gain further insight into the brush-modified particle size. \ud835\udc45\u210e imitates\nthe size of a solvated molecule more closely. Therefore, it is a more appropriate biological\nparameter to determine the size of a molecule in the context of its environment. Thus, \ud835\udc45\u210e of a modified particle is measured by assuming that the brush embedded on its surface moves\nthrough the solution and is resisted by the solvent viscosity. The hydrodynamic radius\nformulation is 1\n\ud835\udc45\u210e =\n1\n2\ud835\udc412 \u27e8\u2211\n1\n\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc56\u2260\ud835\udc57 \u27e9, 74\u201377 where \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 is the distance between \ud835\udc56 and \ud835\udc57 beads of\npolymer brush and CS (\ud835\udc41); the angular brackets denote the averaging over five ensembles.\nLike \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc54 in Fig. 3(a), \ud835\udc45\u210e also increases linearly with time as the brush density increases at CS, having almost the same order of magnitude. The brush swells more with higher initiator\nconcentration, thus, explaining a higher \ud835\udc45\u210e for \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 = 5.0%.\nThe ratio of \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc54 and \ud835\udc45\u210e, \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc53 = \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc45\u210e\u2044 (also known as the shape factor), characterizes the\nshape of a macromolecule. The shape factor for a globular polymer structure is approximately \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc53~0.775. 74,75 However, any departure from the globular to nonglobular (or elongated) shape, \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc45\u210e\u2044 attains higher values as \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc54 turn out to be larger than \ud835\udc45\u210e. For a hollow sphere, \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc53~ 1.0.\nAt early times, the brush growth is minimal, and hence, the shape factor for the modified CS\nat this stage is estimated as \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc53 \u2208 (1.05 \u2212 1.065) for all \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 values as displayed in Fig. 3(c).\nHowever, ATRP-brush modified CS tends toward attaining a relatively more globular shape\nwith time; thus, \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc53 decreases. At late times, the shape factor is smaller (\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc53 \u22cd 0.985) for \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 = 5.0% than for the other two \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 values (see Fig. 3(c)). Nevertheless, when we allow the brush growth for a much longer time at which Conv\ud835\udc40 \u2192 90%, the fabricated MP attains the shape factor \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc53 \u22cd 0.94 (this result is not displayed here due to brevity).\nTo illustrate the polymerized (brush) beads distribution tethered, we compute the radial\ndistribution function (RDF), \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc5f) = \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc35 \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc35\u2044 of brush beads at a radial distance, \ud835\udc5f = (|\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65|2 + |\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc66|2 + |\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc67|2)1/2 from the CS beads. Here, \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc35(\ud835\udc5f) = \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc35(\ud835\udc5f) \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc60\u210e\u2044 denotes the local brush density, and \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc35 = \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc35 \ud835\udc49\u2044 indicates the total brush density. \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc35(\ud835\udc5f) is the local number of brush beads (displayed in the blue and green colors) in a shell of volume \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc60\u210e at a distance \ud835\udc5f from the microparticle bead (displayed in the orange color), \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc35 represents the total brush beads, and \ud835\udc49 is the total volume of the box. The plots in Fig. 4(a) exhibit the variation in RDF for\nthree different \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 values as denoted by the black, red, and green symbols. As expected, the larger peak width and height shown by the green curve validate that brush beads are more\ntightly bound around CS at \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 = 5.0% due to higher monomer conversion than at \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 = 1.0% and 2.5%. The plot of number density \ud835\udf0c(\ud835\udc67) of brush beads along the transverse (\ud835\udc67)-direction\nis displayed in Fig. 4(b). The curves at different \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56, further certify that more brush beads are localized around CS (10 < \ud835\udc67 < 30) at \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 = 5.0% than at \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 = 1.0% (black curve) and \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 = 2.5% (red curves). Overall, an increase in the initiator concentration yields noticeable brush\nswelling, which could facilitate the biopolymer diffusion into the brush matrix, thereby\nenabling immobilization.\nWe next consider SS and RS to study the surface modification due to ATRP-brush growth\nand its influence on biopolymer adsorption. However, first, we compare corresponding\nphysical properties related to the structural change of SS and RS with CS, as discussed above.\nThen, since the brush modified CS is highly swollen for the brush growth up to \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3a = 1500 at \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 = 5.0%, we compare the SS and RS fabrication with CS by considering the polymerization up to the same simulation time steps for \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 = 5.0%.\nIn Fig. 5, we plot Conv\ud835\udc40 and log([\ud835\udc40]0 [\ud835\udc40]\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\u2044 ) as a function of time for SS and RS and compared them with the results obtained for CS. The initiators are evenly distributed at both\nthe surfaces of RS and only at the outer surface of SS. The surface fabrication is led by growing\nthe ATRP brushes up to \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3a = 1500. We observe that Conv\ud835\udc40 for SS (red curve) is slightly higher than RS (green curve) and CS (black curve) at early times (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3a \u2272 350). Whereas the gap is enhanced over time, as displayed in Figs. 5(a)-(b), due to higher monomer accessibility\nto active radicals tethered at a larger outer surface of SS than CS and RS. The propagation\nreaction (Conv\ud835\udc40) for RS is also growing at almost the same rate as fS at early times (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3a \u2272 1000). However, a slightly higher conversion is obtained for RS beyond this time. For RS, the\nmonomers are equally accessible to initiators at both surfaces. Thus, initiators/active radicals\nhave equal accessibility to monomers. The brush growth at the outer CS can occur at the same\nrate for the SS; however, the monomers are less accessible to initiators at the inner concave\nsurface of CS. Thus, the effective rate of chain propagation at CS is balanced such that it yields\nless monomer conversion than on RS and SS. Overall, Fig. 5(b) illustrates that the propagation reaction rate (log([\ud835\udc40]0 [\ud835\udc40]\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\u2044 )) at different surfaces varies linearly with time (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3a) thus, exhibiting the expected first-order reaction kinetics.\nWe illustrate the morphology of fabricated CS, SS, and RS due to ATRP-brush growth up\nto different polymerization times, \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3a = 400 (Fig. 6(a-c)), 800 (Fig. 6(d-f)), and 1500 (Fig. 6(g-i)) at \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 = 5.0%. The Conv\ud835\udc40 at CS, SS, and RS for \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3a = 1500 are ~23%, ~26%, and ~24%, respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 5(a). The corresponding estimated brush length\nis \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc35 \u2243 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc5f0 where \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc35 \u2243 79, 97, and 86 are the number of polymerized beads per brush chain bounded at CS, SS, and RS, respectively. At \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3a = 400, the monomer conversion is almost the same at all surfaces, hence, nearly the same brush length: \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc35 \u2243 21\ud835\udc5f0 for CS and RS, and \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc35 \u2243 26\ud835\udc5f0 for SS are assessed. However, \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc35 increases with time and is slightly different from each other at different surfaces due to diverse monomer conversion, as can be seen in Fig 5.\nFor the polymerization up to \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3a = 800, the approximate brush lengths are \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc35 \u2243 41\ud835\udc5f0, 53\ud835\udc5f0, and 43\ud835\udc5f0 at CS, SS, and RS where Conv\ud835\udc40 \u2243 11%, 14%, and 12%, respectively. Figures 6(jl) show the brush density variation around MP surfaces in the \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66-plane at \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc67 = 25, corresponding to Figs. 6(g-i). The yellow color represents the crosssection of various MPs, and\nthe red region displays the ATRP-brush density.\nThe shape and size of ATRP-brush modified differently-shaped particles are compared at\n\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 = 5.0%. First, we plot \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc54 as a function of \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3a in Fig. 7(a). The difference in \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc54 values are due to different MP structures; \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc54 for SS is higher than CS and RS. However, the latter two surfaces maintained similar growth in \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc54 against time with a tiny advancement for RS at late times due to higher Conv\ud835\udc40 (shown in Fig. 5). With a considerable Conv\ud835\udc40 at SS (as discussed in Fig. 5), the initial surge in \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc54 is maintained till late times. Similar to \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc54, the hydrodynamic radius (\ud835\udc45\u210e) for the modified surfaces varies linearly with time, as presented in Fig. 7(b). In Fig. 7(c), we plot the shape factor (\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc53) to characterize and compare the temporal variation in the shape of modified MPs. At early times, when Conv\ud835\udc40 is small, \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc53 is highest for RS and lowest for SS due to their different unmodified shapes. However, \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc53 for CS and RS approach a similar value as the polymerization increases with time. Though, \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc53 for SS remains the lowest for the entire polymerization period considered here.\nWe compare \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc5f) versus \ud835\udc5f for the ATRP brushes around CS in Fig. 8(a), SS in Fig. 8(b),\nand RS in Fig. 8(c) at \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 = 5.0% for three different brush lengths assessed at \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3a = 400, 800, and 1500. The corresponding brush lengths at each surface are estimated and\ndiscussed a short while ago. Figure 8 demonstrates that the peak height increases with brush\nlength, and its position moves to higher \ud835\udc5f for the modified particles. This suggests an increase\nin the local brush density (\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc35). Thus, the brushes are more closely bound to MP surfaces. The increase in the width of RDF with \ud835\udc5f, validates the spreading of growing brush chains. The\nlocal brush density becomes negligible with \ud835\udc5f \u2192 \u221e and hence, \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc5f) \u2192 0. Following the\nprevious observations as depicted in Figs. 5-7, the variation of \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc5f) is very similar for both CS\nand RS; nevertheless, \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc5f) for RS has a slight edge (in Fig. 8(c)) over CS (in Fig. 8(a)). Figure\n8(b) shows that the peak of \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc5f) for SS is lower than for CS and RS. The reason for this could\nbe the lower \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc35 per shell because of the hollow core of the spherical MP and higher \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60(= 2 \u00d7 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc60 or 2 \u00d7 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc60), which reduces \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc35(\ud835\udc5f). Since SS has a hollow core, and no other beads, including the brush beads, can penetrate it, we also see a sudden jump at \ud835\udc5f \u2248 2\ud835\udc450.\nRecall that the brush grafting density increases with the polymerization, which causes an\nincrease in the surface charges. Thus, the brushes get stretched out and swollen due to the\nincompatible interaction between the brush beads (\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35 = 27). Furthermore, the negatively charged biopolymers (\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f = 27) pave the way to enter into the brush region and get adsorbed due to much favorable interaction (\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc4f = 15) between the swollen brush and biopolymers.\nWe introduce the equilibrated biopolymer chains of length \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4f = 25 in the solution, and\nanalyze the adsorption at different brush modified surfaces for a period \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 = 3000. In Figs. 9(a-c), we compare the fraction of biopolymer adsorbed (\ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34) with time on fabricated CS (black curve), SS (red curve), and RS (green curve) in the presence of various fractions of biopolymers, \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f = 2 \u00d7 10 \u22122, 4 \u00d7 10\u22122, and 8 \u00d7 10\u22122, respectively. We found that the biopolymers are getting adsorbed within the brush region at nearly the same rate on different\nbrush-modified surfaces for some initial period (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 \u2272 300). However, as time progresses, \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 for SS is growing faster than CS and RS for up to \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 \u2272 900. This observation is consistent with all the biopolymer concentrations used in the simulation. Furthermore, it seems pretty\nevident as the brush length (\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc35) and the radius of gyration (\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc54) are prominent for SS due to higher monomer conversion than CS and RS.\nTo compute \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34, we count the number of biopolymer beads within \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc54 of modified MPs\nand then scale it with the total number of beads (\ud835\udc41) in the system. Interestingly, for \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 > 900, we find a gradual crossover in \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 curves for RS to its corresponding noticeable higher value (see the green curves in Fig. 9) than for the other two surfaces at all the biopolymer\nconcentrations (\ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f). The crossover becomes more prominent with increasing values of \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f as depicted in Figs. 9(b-c). On the other hand, \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 data for SS (red curve) and CS (black curve) converge to nearly the same lower value (steady-state value) for a given \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f at late times. However, the red curve (\ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 for SS) approaches the steady-state faster than the black curve (for CS) at a relatively higher \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f. At late times, the reason for a lower \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 at SS could be a relatively higher volume of the swollen brush region due to a more considerable brush length\n(\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc35) caused by higher monomer conversion at SS. The larger volume implies a more porous brush region around SS. The biopolymers more easily diffuse into the brush matrix due to a\nfavorable interaction (\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc4f = 15) between the brush and biopolymer beads. Note that\nbiopolymers are negatively-charged molecules. Therefore, some biopolymers can easily\ndiffuse out of the brush region after relatively quicker initial adsorption due to unfavorable\ninteraction (\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f = 27) between the biopolymer beads. Therefore, the number of trapped biopolymers within fabricated SS is relatively smaller than RS.\nTo demonstrate the effect of brush lengths on biopolymer adsorption, we consider the\nsurface-initiated ATRP-brushes grew up to \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3a = 400, 800, and 1500 at each surfaces considered here for \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 = 5% and \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f = 8 \u00d7 10 \u22122. The corresponding brush lengths are \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc35 \u2248 21, 41, and 79 for CS, \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc35 \u2248 26, 53, and 97 for SS, and \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc35 \u2248 21, 43, and 86 for RS (brush lengths are measured in the units of \ud835\udc5f0). To analyze the biopolymer adsorption at different brush lengths, we first plot \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc5f) versus \ud835\udc5f in Fig. 10 at \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 = 3000, mainly to show the radial distribution of biopolymers within the brush region. Here, we take the biopolymer chain length\n\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4f = 25. In ascending order, the black, red, and green curves exhibit \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc5f) data for different brush lengths. Figure 10(a) displays that for CS, \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc5f) peak strength and position enhanced,\nand also it is getting wider with increasing \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc35. This implies that a more fraction of biopolymers have uniformly diffused into the brush region for a longer brush length; a similar behavior is observed for SS and RS, as shown in Figs. 10 (b-c). A sudden jump in \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc5f) is observed for SS\nat \ud835\udc5f \u2248 2\ud835\udc450 due to the absence of biopolymer molecules within the hollow SS, as explained earlier in Fig. 8(b). We plot \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 versus \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 in Figs. 10(d-f), which displays that biopolymer adsorption increases with \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc35 as shown by the black, red, and green curves. Similar to the results in Fig 9, the fraction of biopolymer adsorbed is relatively more for RS as in Fig. 10(f) than CS\nand SS as in Figs. 10(d-e). After an initial growth in \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34, data saturates to a specific value for each brush length at late times; this behavior remains the same for all the modified surfaces.\nThe adsorption is relatively minor for the shorter brushes, and the corresponding data saturates\nearly.\nThe biopolymer length (\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4f) significantly influences the amount of adsorption on brushmodified surfaces, as illustrated in Fig. 11. To characterize it, we consider biopolymers of three\ndifferent chain lengths \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4f = 1, 10, and 25, and monitor their adsorption up to \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 = 3000 at \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f = 8 \u00d7 10 \u22122. The plots of \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc5f) versus \ud835\udc5f, and \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 versus \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 curves are displayed in Fig. 11 with the black, red, and green symbols. They exhibit the biopolymers distribution, and the\nfraction of it adsorbed within the ATRP-brush matrix on CS, SS, and RS. The brushes are\nallowed to grow on these surfaces till \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3a = 1500 for \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56 = 5%. These plots explain that the adsorption is more for the longer biopolymer chains, independent of the modified surface type.\nNotice the RDF curves in Figs. 11(a-c), the higher peak strength at lower \ud835\udc5f certifies that\nbiopolymers are more closely packed around the modified surfaces for \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4f = 25 and 10 (see the green and red curves). However, the black \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc5f) curves show that when we coarse-grain the\nbiopolymer with a single bead (\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4f = 1), they are loosely bounded around the modified surfaces and uniformly distributed in a wide range of \ud835\udc5f from the surface beads.\nThe curves in Figs. 11(d-f) demonstrate that \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 saturates to a finite value, i.e., the\nbiopolymer adsorption attains a steady-state value, for all the cases studied here within the\nadsorption time \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 = 3000. Similar to the results obtained for \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4f = 25 (see Figs. 9 and 10), \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 is higher at RS (\ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 \u2248 11.6 \u00d7 10 \u22123) than CS and SS with \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 \u2248 10.6 \u00d7 10 \u22123 for \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4f = 10. It is interesting to note that \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 reaches its steady-state (constant) value sooner with decreasing biomolecule size \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4f. The gap in \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 values at different modified surfaces are also getting insignificant. Therefore, for \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4f = 1, \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc34 \u2248 6.0 \u00d7 10 \u22123 for all the modified surfaces (see the black curves in Fig. 11 (d-f)). This could be attributed to a quick diffusion of smaller molecules into and out of the brush region as the diffusion coefficient \ud835\udc37 ~\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc4f \u22121 where \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc4f is the number of beads in a biopolymer chain. Since the diffusion of longer biopolymer is slow, its\nsaturation takes more time than smaller chains. However, when longer biopolymer chains are\ndiffused into the brush matrix due to strong favorable interaction, they mostly remain trapped\ndue to structural constraints.\n3.2. Experimental Study\nFurther, we performed an additional experimental study to verify the simulation results.\nWe focus on biopolymer adsorption at differently shaped brush modified surfaces such as cups,\nspheres, and disc surfaces; Recall that we have considered the rectangular surface in our\nsimulation instead of the disc-shaped surface. Nevertheless, we presumed that both the flat\nsurfaces (rectangular or disc) would regard the same result within the statistical error. The\ndetail of the experimental setup is briefly provided in SI. However, we can find a more detailed design and explanation in some recent publications.14,16\nIn the experimental study, we synthesize poly(DMAEMA) brush-modified particles of\nvarious shapes such as spheres, cups, and discs following our previous publications14,16 to study\nthe effect of particles\u2019 shape on enzyme immobilization efficiency. To serve the purpose, first,\nwe copolymerize the acrylate monomers, i.e., methyl methacrylate (MMA) and 2-hydroxy\nethyl methacrylate (HEMA), and modify the hydroxyl groups of HEMA moieties via reacting\nwith bromopriopionyl bromide (poly(MMA-co-BEMA)) as discussed in our previous study.14,16 The bromo functional moiety of the copolymer is then utilized as an ATRP initiator\nto grow polymer brushes from the surface of the particles consisting of the copolymer,\npoly(MMA-co-BEMA). The particles with different shapes are made by electrojetting a blend\nof polylactide (75%) and poly(MMA-co-BEMA)(25%) under various conditions, as stated in Table S1.14,16\nDuring the electrojetting process, the polymer droplets are thought to be attracted to the\ncollector at a low solution concentration. The polymer droplet starts bending depending upon\nthe process parameters, resulting in the cup-shaped particle formation. However, in the case of\nhigh concentrations (3\ud835\udc64/\ud835\udc63% and 4.5\ud835\udc64/\ud835\udc63%), this bending is restricted because of enough\nviscous forces acting on the droplet. At 3\ud835\udc64/\ud835\udc63%, the viscosity is not very high, so there is fast\nsolvent evaporation from the outer shell of the polymer droplet leading to a polymer skin\nformation outside the droplet. When solvent from the internal core of this droplet gets\nevaporated, it leads to the collapsing of the polymer droplet, and disc-shaped particles are formed.14,16 However, at 4.5\ud835\udc64/\ud835\udc63%, the concentration gradient from the skin to the core is\ncomparatively high. In this case, relatively more uniform solvent evaporation occurs from the\nshell to the core of the jetted droplet leading to the formation of spheres. In the next step,\nsurface-initiated ATRP (SIATRP) is carried out for one hour to grow poly(DMAEMA) brushes from the surface of the spherical, cup, and disc-shaped particles.14 Brightfield Images and\nconfocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) images for brush modified and \u2018as jetted\u2019 spheres, cup-shaped particles, and disc-shaped particles are shown in Figs. 12 and 13, respectively.14,16\nLater \u03b1-glucosidase enzyme is allowed to adsorb onto the surface of these brush-modified\nparticles of various shapes via electrostatic interaction.16 It is found that brush-modified disc-\nshaped particles exhibit the highest enzyme loading capacity (58,900 \ud835\udc48/\ud835\udc54 or 589 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc54/\ud835\udc54 of\nparticles), as displayed in Fig. 14. This is in excellent agreement with the simulation results\n(exhibited in Figs. 9, 10, and 11). The brush-modified spherical particles demonstrate the\nlowest enzyme immobilization capacity (41,000 \ud835\udc48/\ud835\udc54 or 410 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc54/\ud835\udc54 of particles) (black curve).\nOn the other hand, the brush-modified cup-shaped particles adsorbed (red curve) in between spheres and discs (44,100 U/g or 441 mg/g of particles) (blue curve in Fig. 14).16 The cup-\nshaped particles adsorb slightly more enzyme than spheres (within the error bar), as observed by other researchers also.18 However, their enzyme adsorption capacity was still less than\nbrush-modified disc-shaped particles. This may be due to the difference in the availability of\nsurface area of these particles for polymer brush growth. Cup-shaped particles have the\nprobability of growing polymer brushes from inside and outside surfaces. However, the\ngrafting density of polymer brushes will be less inside the cup due to less accessibility of\nmonomer (DMAEMA) inside the cup surface. Hence, polymer chain growth will be restricted\nto the confined concave surface. In contrast, the disc surface should be equally available, leading to enhanced grafting density and maximum enzyme immobilization efficiency.16 The\nexcellent qualitative agreement of the experimental and simulation results further justifies our\nsimulation model."

            "text": "In conclusion, we have utilized the DPD approach to present a generic and robust\nsimulation model for surface fabrication of different-shaped microparticles with surface-\ninitiated ATRP brush grafting. In particular, we have considered the initiator embedded cups,\nspheres, and flat (rectangular/disc-shaped) surfaces for the modification. We then performed a\ncomparative study of biopolymer adsorption on these brush-modified surfaces to appreciate\nthe critical chemical and physical processes happening at the microscopic level.\nIndependent of the shape of microparticles, the monomer conversion is enhanced with the\naddition of initiator concentration on the surfaces for a fixed period, hence the radius of\ngyration and hydrodynamic radius. The reaction rate kinetics depicted a linear brush growth,\nas expected for any typical living radical polymerization process, thus validating the chemical\nkinetics of our simulation model. We found that polymerization reduced the shape factor for\nall the fabricated surfaces at a fixed initiator concentration. However, we noted a more\nsignificant change for the rectangular surface due to its initial structural constraint that\nadvanced to form a more globular shape with polymerization. As illustrated by the radial\ndistribution function, we found the uniform distribution of ATRP brushes near the surface for\nall the initiator concentrations. Still, they were denser at higher initiator concentrations. The\nbrush density smoothly reduced when moved away from the surface, confirming the brush\nswelling in the solvent.\nFurther, we have studied biopolymer adsorption on brush-modified surfaces. We have\nnoticed enhanced biopolymer adsorption with the increase of (i) brush length at a given surface\nwith fixed initiator concentration; (ii) initiator concentration, which triggered the brush-\nmodified surfaces with higher grafting density and hence, a more swelled brush morphology,\nand (iii) the biopolymer concentration. In addition, we observed biopolymer adsorption for an\nextended period, allowing the amount of adsorbed biopolymer to reach a steady-state\n(saturation point) value for most cases studied here. Most importantly, when adsorption\nreached a saturation point at late times, the flat surface (rectangular/disc-shaped) could adsorb\n(load) more biopolymers than the other two surfaces having nearly the same adsorption. The\nexperimental results verified the same, considering disk-shaped flat surface particles, cups, and\nspherical particles.\nFinally, we have demonstrated a significantly high biopolymer loading for a longer biopolymer\nchain length for all the surfaces. Nevertheless, the modified flat surface had the maximum\nadsorption like in other cases. When the small biopolymer molecules were coarse-grained as a\nsingle bead, we marked a significantly low and nearly similar loading for all the modified\nsurfaces. Overall, our simulation data appeared to agree with the experimental results. These\nresults could lead to a different way of regulating the shape of complex soft materials crucial\nto diverse applications in the biomedical field. For example, the shape and surface chemistry\nare deciding factors in advanced drug delivery and the development of biomedical devices\nusing cell-material interactions."

Rhodamine B dye is purchased from India Mart.\n1.2. Fabrication of spherical, cup-shaped, and disc-shaped particles and their\nsurface modification by growing Poly(DMAEMA) Brushes\nFirst, copolymerization of methyl methacrylate and 2-hydroxy ethyl methacrylate\n(HEMA) is carried out by the bulk ATRP method. The hydroxyl groups (in HEMA unit) are\nconverted to ATRP-initiating moiety (BEMA unit) by reacting them with bromopropionyl\nbromide to yield poly(MMA0.9-co-BEMA0.1) (Mn: 9155 g/mol; PDI:1.38) as discussed in our previous publication.1 Then, spherical, cup-shaped, and disc-shaped particles are made via the\nelectrohydrodynamic jetting (EHDJ) technique. A polymer solution is obtained by a blend of\n75 wt % PLA and 25 wt % poly(MMA-co-BEMA) dissolved in a solvent system (chloroform:\nDMF - 97:3). This is sprayed at different concentrations, flow rates, and applied voltage (details\nof solution/processing parameters are given in Table S1). Then, poly(DMAEMA) chains\n(polymer brushes) are grown from the surface of spherical, cup-shaped, and disc-shaped\nparticles using the \u201cgrafting from\u201d surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization\n(SIATRP) as discussed in our previous paper.1 Except spherical, cup and disc-shaped particle\nformation and brush modifications have already been discussed in our earlier publications.1,2\nShape Concentration of polymer solution (w/v%)\n((75%PLA +25%poly(MMA-co-BEMA))\nFlow rate\n(ml/h) Voltage (kV)\nSpheres 4.5 0.5 8.5\nCups 1 1 9\nDiscs 3 1.5 9\nTable S1: Solution/Processing parameters to fabricate spheres, cups, and discs.\n1.3. Immobilization of the \u03b1-Glucosidase Enzyme onto the brush modified spherical,\ncup-shaped, and disc-shaped particles2\nFirst, \u03b1-glucosidase is mixed in a solvent (phosphate buffer solution (pH \u223c 6.8)) at a\nconcentration of 0.8 mg/mL or 80 U/mL (one unit (U) enzyme may be defined as the amount which can catalyze the conversion of 1 \u03bcmol of \u03b1-PNPG in a minute)2. Initially, particles (1mg)\nare dispersed in 100 \u03bcL (0.08mg/mL) in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, and particles are stirred on\na plate shaker for 1 h at room temperature. After 1h, particles are collected in a centrifuge at\n10,000 rpm and washed three times. The immobilized enzyme amount (active units) is obtained\nby deducting the amount of the enzyme present in the supernatants (initial supernatants and\nsupernatant obtained on washing the particles) from the initial solution. Then, \u03b1-PNPG\n(substrate), which gets hydrolyzed by the \u03b1-glucosidase enzyme to release p-nitrophenol (pNP), is taken for enzyme activity determination.2 Thus, the amount (mmoles) of released p-NP\nis identified by UV/vis spectroscopy at 400 nm (a calibration curve is already prepared using pure p-nitrophenol)2. The experiments are performed in triplicate.\n1.4. Characterization Methods.\nUV absorbance is done on Synergy h1, microplate reader.
