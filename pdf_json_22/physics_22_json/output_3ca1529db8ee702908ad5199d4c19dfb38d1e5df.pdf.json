We will review the notions of equilibrium measure and quadrature domain and then discuss how they relate in general. This will serve to motivate a search for domains that exhibit particular weighted quadrature identities.The result will be a description of the supports of equilibrium measures in the context of external fields with additional point sources. For a discussion of several varieties of quadrature domains, see [19].\n1.1. External Fields and Equilibrium Measures\nConsider a unit charge placed onto the complex plane that is free to distribute into the configuration of least logarithmic energy under the influence of an external field. The external field is given as an extended real-valued function and the unit charge distribution placed into the plane is conceived as a probability measure.\nTo be precise, suppose an external field Q(z) : C \u2192 R \u222a {\u221e} is given which is admissible. This means exp(\u2212Q(z)) is upper-semicontinuous, positive-valued on a set of positive logarithmic capacity, and satisfies |z| exp(\u2212Q(z))\u2192 0 as |z| \u2192 \u221e (see [25]). For any probability measure \u00b5 supported in the plane, the weighted logarithmic energy of \u00b5 is \u222b\nC \u222b C ln 1 |w \u2212 z| d\u00b5(w)d\u00b5(z) + 2 \u222b C Q(w)d\u00b5(w).\n\u2217Corresponding Author Email addresses: dragnevp@pfw.edu (Peter D.

Saff) 1The research of this author was supported in part by NSF grant DMS-1936543.\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier March 18, 2022\nar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n09 42\n1v 1\n[ m\nat h.\nC V\n] 1\n7 M\nar 2\nIn the presence of such an admissible external field, there is a unique energyminimizing probability measure \u00b5Q called the equilibrium measure of the system. It can be described in terms of its logarithmic potential by the Frostman Theorem (see [25] Theorem I.1.1.3). A consequence is that the equilibrium measure has constant weighted potential on its support (quasi-everywhere2). The physical interpretation is that a potential difference would induce a current which would redistribute the charge. Mathematically, for some constant CQ, and letting SQ = supp(\u00b5Q) be the support of the equilibrium measure, the following holds for z \u2208 SQ (quasi-everywhere):\u222b\nC ln\n1\n|w \u2212 z| d\u00b5Q(w) +Q(z) = CQ.\nThe weighted potential is also at least CQ outside SQ. These conditions on the weighted potential in fact characterize the equilibrium measure.\nWe are especially interested in the case of a smooth subharmonic admissible external field Q(z) to which additional point sources are added, say at z1, z2, . . . , zn \u2208 C of positive intensities q1, q2, . . . , qn, respectively. Setting q := \u2211n j=1 qj , we consider the new external field\nV (z) := (1 + q)Q(z) + n\u2211 j=1 qj ln |z \u2212 zj |\u22121.\nWith SQ = supp(\u00b5Q) and SV = supp(\u00b5V ), we would like to characterize the equilibrium support SV and see how it compares to SQ.\nAdding the point sources causes an outward flux that tends to displace the support of the equilibrium measure. The factor (1+q) in V (z) is chosen to compensate for this with a greater inward influence from infinity. (We will see that this choice is natural insofar as SV will take the simple form SQ\\\u2126 for an open set \u2126, when the point sources have low intensity and are placed inside SQ.) Since quadrature domains will play an important role in our approach to these problems, we briefly review their essential features.\n1.2. Quadrature Domains\nA classical quadrature domain \u2126 for a given test class of functions is a domain in C such that for all functions f in the test class, integration over the domain is equal to a linear combination of point evaluations of the function and its derivatives. In other words the following holds: \u222b\n\u2126 f(z)dAz = N\u2211 j=1 nj\u2211 k=0 cjkf (k)(zj), (1.1)\nwhere dAz is Lebesgue area measure, the zj are points in \u2126 and the cjk are constants that do not depend on f . When the variable of integration is understood we may\n2A property holds quasi-everywhere if the set of points where it does not hold has capacity zero. A set has capacity zero when \u222b \u222b ln |x\u2212y|\u22121d\u00b5(x)d\u00b5(y) = +\u221e for every probability measure \u00b5 supported on the set.\ndrop the subscript from the area measure and write dA. Formula (1.1) is known as a quadrature identity. Common choices of test class include the space A1(\u2126) of integrable analytic functions, the space of integrable analytic functions with primitive, harmonic functions, the Hardy space H2(\u2126), and the Bergman space A2(\u2126) of squareintegrable analytic functions. For more on the foundations of quadrature domains, see [1, 2, 4, 6, 14, 16, 27, 12] Here and throughout this article, \u2018analytic\u2019 will be taken to mean complex analytic.\nQuadrature domains whose quadrature identity involves just a multiple of a single point evaluation have been dubbed \u2018one-point\u2019 quadrature domains (see, for example, [5, 17]). Usually the term implies that the point evaluation involves a function value, and not a derivative value. We will keep that convention here.\nIn this article we admit the following generalization: integration on the left side of the quadrature identity will occur with respect to modified measures. We will especially be concerned with the complex measure |z|\u22122pdz along the boundary of the domain and with the positively weighted area measure |z|2pdAz, p \u2208 N. For simplicity our domains will always be C\u221e smooth and bounded. The default test class for quadrature identities shall be A\u221e(\u2126), the space of analytic functions on \u2126 that are C\u221e smooth up to the boundary. By density this test class will allow us to appeal to the Hardy and Bergman spaces when needed (e.g. [6] first paragraph of Chapter 4, Theorem 6.2, and Cor 15.1).\nThe assumption of smoothness (and sometimes simple-connectedness) is made to keep the focus on an elegant connection between equilibrium and quadrature. Classical quadrature domains are always algebraic and admit only certain boundary singularities [26, 14, 1]. On the other hand, general questions of \u2018regularity\u2019 for equilibrium problems are nontrivial [18]. In Theorem 11, we see an example of a conclusion obtained under assumptions of smoothness that can be verified directly from Frostman\u2019s Theorem.\n1.3. Outline\nIn Section 2 we show the relationship between supports of equilibrium measures and quadrature identities in the setting of a smooth and subharmonic admissible external field with additional point sources.\nIn Section 3 we identify one-point quadrature domains with respect to the measures we mentioned above. This will occur in three stages. We first consider domains that exclude the origin. Then we examine domains containing the origin, considering separately those where the origin is and is not the quadrature node.\nIn the final Section 4 we apply our results to the case of the admissible external field Q(z) = |z|2p, p \u2208 N, in the plane with additional point sources. We include a connection to quadrature properties of Cassini ovals pointed out in Exercise 22.3a of [19]. We also examine more generally the case of what will be termed a cavity."

            "text": "Suppose Q(z) is a smooth subharmonic admissible external field in the complex plane. The equilibrium measure \u00b5Q in the plane in the presence of Q(z) will have\ncompact support SQ (see e.g. [25], [22], [18]). On the interior of SQ the equilibrium measure has the form (2\u03c0)\u22121\u2206QdA.\nTo proceed we assume SQ is the closure of a smooth bounded domain, and that \u00b5Q = (2\u03c0) \u22121\u2206QdA \u2223\u2223 SQ (without singular part on the boundary). Under these assumptions we can describe SQ in terms of a conformal mapping of its exterior. (For a detailed discussion of smoothness in equilibrium problems, see [18].)\nLet ScQ := C\u0302\\SQ be the exterior of SQ, and let \u03b1 be an interior point of SQ. Frostman\u2019s Theorem says that for z \u2208 SQ,\n1\n2\u03c0 \u222b SQ \u2206Q(w) ln 1 |w \u2212 z| dAw +Q(z) = C\nfor some constant C. Indicating holomorphic differentiation by \u2202 and antiholomorphic differentiation by \u2202\u0304, recall that \u2206Q = 4\u2202\u2202\u0304Q. So in the equality above, we differentiate in z to obtain\n1\n\u03c0 \u222b SQ \u2202\u2202\u0304Q(w) w \u2212 z dAw + \u2202Q(z) = 0, z \u2208 int (SQ).\nBy the Cauchy-Green Formula (e.g. [6] Theorem 2.1), this means\n1\n2\u03c0i \u222b \u2202SQ \u2202Q(w) w \u2212 z dw = 0.\nNow change variables conformally via t := 1w\u2212\u03b1 , \u03b6 := 1 z\u2212\u03b1 , and let S \u2217 Q and (S c Q) \u2217 be the images of SQ and S c Q respectively under this change:\n\u2212 1 2\u03c0i \u222b \u2202S\u2217Q \u2202Q(t\u22121 + \u03b1)t\u03b6 \u03b6 \u2212 t 1 t2 dt = 0.\nSince SQ and S c Q have the same boundary but with opposite orientations, we rewrite\nthis as \u222b \u2202(ScQ) \u2217 t\u22121\u2202Q(t\u22121 + \u03b1) t\u2212 \u03b6 dt = 0, \u03b6 \u2208 int(S\u2217Q)\nBy Mergelyan\u2019s theorem (e.g. [24] Chapter 20 ), we can pass from this equality by uniform convergence to \u222b\n\u2202(ScQ) \u2217 t\u22121\u2202Q(t\u22121 + \u03b1)h(t)dt = 0\nfor all h \u2208 A\u221e((ScQ)\u2217). In the language of quadrature domains, we can summarize the above discussion as follows: mapping the exterior of SQ via the mapping z \u2192 t := (z\u2212\u03b1)\u22121, the resulting (ScQ) \u2217 is a null quadrature domain with respect to the complex boundary measure t\u22121\u2202Q(t\u22121 + \u03b1)dt.\nThe above can also be applied to certain cases when the external field Q(z) is perturbed by point sources. Consider the external field V (z) = (1+q)Q(z)+ \u2211n j=1 qj ln |z\u2212\nzj |\u22121, where point sources are added at locations zj \u2208 C with intensities qj > 0. Assume that the equilibrium measure support SV in the plane in the presence of V (z) is the closure of a smooth bounded simply connected domain. Following the reasoning above for V (z) in place of Q(z), the ln |z \u2212 zj |\u22121 terms will differentiate into Cauchy kernels. These will produce point evaluations when integrated. Thus (ScV )\n\u2217 in this case will be a quadrature domain with respect to t\u22121\u2202Q(t\u22121 + \u03b1)dt, with quadrature nodes at the points (zj \u2212\u03b1)\u22121. For illustration, a diagram of the mapping used above is found in Figure 1 for the case of a single point source added to a field Q(z) = |z|2p.\nOn the other hand, when point sources of sufficiently small intensity and are placed into the interior of an existing equilibrium support, we expect by partial balayage [15, 23] that the new equilibrium support will exclude neighborhoods of the point charges. (In other words, the point sources \u2018sweep clean\u2019 a region of charge in their vicinity.) We will call these swept-clean voids in the support cavities (see Figure 2). For examples see [21] where the cavities corresponding to point sources on the sphere are proven to come from quadrature domains; or [3], where for external field |z|2 the cavities are explained to be quadrature domains for Lebesgue area measure. On the sphere, quadrature domains have also appeared in [9, 10, 11] in the context of vector equilibrium problems and of fluid dynamics. The effect of monomial terms added to a background external field was studied in [20].\nGiven the admissible external field Q(z), let again SQ = supp(\u00b5Q) be the support of the equilibrium measure in the plane in the presence of Q(z). Then add point sources of intensity qj > 0, j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n at points z1, z2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , zn \u2208 C respectively, and set q = \u2211n j=1 qj . Consider the external field V (z) = (1 + q)Q(z) + \u2211n j=1 qj ln |z \u2212 zj |\u22121. If the zj are interior points of SQ and if the qj are sufficiently small, then by balayage the support SV of the equilibrium measure in the plane in the presence of V (z) will be SQ\\\u2126, for \u2126 an open set. In fact 1+q2\u03c0 \u222b \u2126 \u2206Q(z)dAz = q and 1+q 2\u03c0 \u222b SQ \u2206Q(z)dAz = (1 + q). In other words SV is formed by spreading a total charge of (1 + q) over the set SQ, then deleting an open set amounting to a charge of q. In this setting we will call the components of \u2126 cavities. Recall that the factor (1 + q) in V (z) is introduced so that the cavities are taken from SQ. (Otherwise the point sources would tend to expand the outer boundary of the support in addition to forming cavities).\nIn this situation, we can prove that \u2126 (the union of all cavities) is a \u2018quadrature open\nset,\u2019 namely an open set that has a quadrature identity but which is not necessarily connected.\nBy Frostman\u2019s condition for equilibrium measure \u00b5Q,\n1 + q\n2\u03c0 \u222b SQ \u2206Q(w) ln 1 |w \u2212 z| dAw + (1 + q)Q(z) = (1 + q)CQ\nfor a constant CQ, valid for z \u2208 SQ. Likewise Frostman\u2019s theorem applied to the equilibrium measure \u00b5V in the presence of V (z) := (1 + q)Q(z) + \u2211n j=1 qj ln |z \u2212 zj |\u22121 yields\n1 + q\n2\u03c0 \u222b SV \u2206Q(w) ln 1 |w \u2212 z| dAw + (1 + q)Q(z) + n\u2211 j=1 qj ln 1 |z \u2212 zj | = CV\nfor a constant CV , valid for z \u2208 SV . Differentiate these equalities with respect to z and subtract one from the other. We see for z \u2208 SV that\n1 + q\n\u03c0 \u222b \u2126 \u2202\u2202\u0304Q(w) w \u2212 z dAw \u2212 n\u2211 j=1 qj zj \u2212 z = 0.\nIn other words \u222b \u2126 \u2202\u2202\u0304Q(w) w \u2212 z dAw = \u03c0 1 + q n\u2211 j=1 qj zj \u2212 z .\nUsing an approximation theorem of Bers [8], we see by taking limits that\u222b \u2126 \u2206Q(w)h(w)dAw = 4\u03c0 1 + q n\u2211 j=1 qjh(zj),\nfor all h \u2208 A1(\u2126), where A1(\u2126) is the space of integrable holomorphic functions on \u2126. We conclude that \u2126 is a quadrature open set for weighted area measure \u2206QdA.\nBut Q(z) is subharmonic, and the interior of SQ is in the region where \u2206Q > 0. Thus if \u2126 had a component \u21260 that did not contain any of the zj , then with test function h(z) = 1 on that component and h(z) = 0 on all others, we would have\u222b\n\u21260 \u2206Q(z)dAz = 0, which contradicts the positivity of \u2206Q.\nSo each component of \u2126 contains at least one of the zj , j = 1, 2, . . . , n and is in fact a quadrature domain using weighted measure \u2206QdA, with quadrature nodes at locations of point charges. We also note that in this case there was no assumption of boundary regularity, though implicitly we have assumed that \u2202SQ has Lebesgue measure 0, which is true for smooth enough Q(z) [18].\nWe summarize this as our first theorem.\nTheorem 1. Let Q(z) be a smooth subharmonic admissible external field in the plane. Let V (z) := (1 + q)Q(z) + \u2211n j=1 qj ln |z \u2212 zj |\u22121 and set q = \u2211n j=1 qj. Let SQ be the support of the equilibrium measure \u00b5Q in the plane, and SV the support of the equilibrium measure \u00b5V . We assume that \u00b5Q and \u00b5V do not have singular parts supported on the boundaries of SQ and SV , respectively.\n(i) If z1, z2, . . . , zn are interior points of SQ and if q1, q2, . . . , qn are small positive intensities, so that SV = SQ\\\u2126 for an open set \u2126 \u2282 SQ, then each component O of \u2126 is a quadrature domain for weighted area measure \u2206QdA. The quadrature nodes are all the points among the z1, z2, . . . , zn that lie in O.\n(ii) Suppose SV is smooth and simply connected with z1, z2, . . . , zn in the exterior of SV . Let \u03b1 be an interior point of SV . Let S c V := C\u0302\\SV be the exterior of SV , and let (ScV ) \u2217 be the image of ScV under the conformal mapping z 7\u2192 t := (z \u2212 \u03b1)\u22121. Then (ScV ) \u2217 is a quadrature domain with respect to boundary measure t\u22121\u2202Q(t\u22121 +\u03b1)dt. The quadrature nodes are the points (zj \u2212 \u03b1)\u22121, j = 1, 2, . . . , n."

            "heading": "3. Quadrature Domains for modified measures",
            "text": "In anticipation of describing some equilibrium supports as above using the particular external field Q(z) = C|z|2p, C > 0, we now identify quadrature domains for the corresponding measures mentioned in Theorem 1. In this case \u2206Q(z) = 4p2|z|2p\u22122 and \u2202Q(z) = pzp\u22121z\u0304p. So let us focus on quadrature domains with respect to the weighted area measure |z|2pdA, and the complex boundary measure |z|\u22122pdz. In this section we treat such domains in their own right. In the next section we will make the connection again to equilibrium measures.\nThe first thing to note is that quadrature domains with respect to these measures are related by Green\u2019s theorem.\nTheorem 2. Let p be a natural number, and \u2126 a smooth bounded domain in the plane, 0 /\u2208 \u2202\u2126, such that for some constants cjk, and points zj \u2208 \u2126, the quadrature identity\u222b\n\u2202\u2126\nf(z) |z|2p dz = N\u2211 j=1 nj\u2211 k=0 cjkf (k)(zj)\nholds for f \u2208 H2(\u2126). Then \u2126 is a quadrature domain with test class A2(\u2126) with respect to the weighted area measure |z|2p\u22122dA.\nProof. For f \u2208 A\u221e(\u2126), rewrite the right hand side of the quadrature identity using the Cauchy formula. Then note that there exists a rational function R on \u2126 which is smooth up to the boundary with poles located at the zj (with order nj) such that\u222b\n\u2202\u2126\nf(z) |z|2p dz = \u222b \u2202\u2126 R(z)f(z)dz\nfor all such f .\nSuch f are dense in the Hardy space. The structure of the orthogonal complement of the Hardy space on a smooth bounded domain (see [6]) ensures there is an H \u2208 A\u221e(\u2126) such that\n1\n|z|2p \u2212R(z) = H(z), z \u2208 \u2202\u2126.\nThus |z|2p has the same boundary values as does a meromorphic function smooth up to the boundary of \u2126. This means that \u222b \u2202\u2126 f(z)|z|\n2pdz is equal to a linear combination of evaluations of f and its derivatives (the same linear combination for all f) by the Residue theorem. For brevity, let L : A\u221e(\u2126) \u2192 C denote this linear combination of evaluations, and \u222b\n\u2202\u2126 f(z)|z|2pdz = Lf.\nBy Green\u2019s theorem \u222b \u2126 f(z)zpz\u0304p\u22121dA = 1 2i Lf.\nFrom here we consider separately the cases where 0 \u2208 \u2126 and 0 /\u2208 \u2126. First, suppose 0 /\u2208 \u2126. Then\u222b\n\u2126 f(z)|z|2p\u22122dA = \u222b \u2126 f(z) z zpz\u0304p\u22121dA = 1 2i Lf(z) z ,\nwhich is a quadrature identity.\nIn case 0 \u2208 \u2126 we have\n\u222b \u2126 (f(z)\u2212 f(0))|z|2p\u22122dA = \u222b \u2126 f(z)\u2212 f(0) z zpz\u0304p\u22121dA = 1 2i Lf(z)\u2212 f(0) z .\nHence we see \u222b \u2126 f(z)|z|2p\u22122dA = kf(0) + 1 2i Lf(z)\u2212 f(0) z ,\nwhere k = \u222b\n\u2126 |z| 2p\u22122dA. This is a quadrature identity (which may introduce evalua-\ntions of derivatives of f at z = 0.)\n3.1. One-point quadrature domains whose closures exclude the origin\nFor unweighted planar Lebesgue measure dA, it is well known that the only onepoint quadrature domains for integrable harmonic functions are discs [13]. With the measures we are now considering, other possibilities arise.\nWe will consider separately the cases where the origin is in the domain or outside the closure. By a pth root of a disc, we will mean a set { p \u221a z : |z \u2212 a| < r} for a given complex number a and a positive number r, r < |a|, and where p \u221a z denotes an analytic branch of z1/p defined on the disc |z \u2212 a| < r. Recall that unless stated otherwise, the test class for quadrature identities is A\u221e.\nTheorem 3. With p a natural number, let \u2126, 0 /\u2208 \u2126, be a smooth bounded one-point quadrature domain with respect to the weighted area measure |z|2p\u22122dA. Then \u2126 is a pth root of a disc.\nProof. By hypothesis there exists a complex constant c and a point z0 \u2208 \u2126 such that for all f \u2208 A\u221e(\u2126), \u222b\n\u2126 f(z)|z|2p\u22122dA = cf(z0).\nSince the origin is excluded from the closure of the domain, f(z)/zp\u22121 is analytic and so \u222b\n\u2126 f(z)z\u0304p\u22121dA = \u222b \u2126 f(z) zp\u22121 |z|2p\u22122dA = c zp\u221210 f(z0).\nNow use Green\u2019s theorem, rewrite the right hand side using the Cauchy formula, and collect the terms to obtain for a new constant C\u222b\n\u2202\u2126 f(z)(z\u0304p \u2212 C z \u2212 z0 )dz = 0.\nBy orthogonality to the Hardy space, we conclude that there exists H \u2208 A\u221e(\u2126) such that\nz\u0304p = H(z) + C\nz \u2212 z0 , z \u2208 \u2202\u2126.\nOn setting G(z) := H(z)(z \u2212 z0) + C, we have\nz\u0304p = G(z)\nz \u2212 z0 , z \u2208 \u2202\u2126\nLet T (z) := \u2211p\u22121\nj=0 z p\u22121\u2212jzj0 and observe\nz\u0304p \u2212 z\u03040p = G(z)T (z)\nzp \u2212 zp0 \u2212 z\u03040p, z \u2208 \u2202\u2126\nClearing the denominator,\n|zp \u2212 zp0 | 2 = h(z), z \u2208 \u2202\u2126\nwhere h(z) := G(z)T (z)\u2212 z\u03040p(zp \u2212 zp0) is analytic and smooth up to the boundary of \u2126.\nFrom here, the imaginary part of h is 0 on the boundary of \u2126, and by the maximum principle h must be a positive real constant throughout \u2126, say h(z) = K2 > 0. Thus on the boundary of \u2126\n|zp \u2212 zp0 | = K.\nFor each z on the boundary of \u2126, zp is on the circle of radius K about zp0 . If K > |zp0 |, then the union of all values of branches of the pth roots of the points on the circle would comprise the boundary a single bounded domain, which would contain the origin. Then \u2126 would be this very domain, which is impossible since 0 /\u2208 \u2126. Similarly if K = |zp0 | then 0 would be a boundary point of \u2126 which is impossible.\nThus K < |zp0 |, and taking pth roots of points on the circle of radius K about z p 0 gives a union of closed smooth curves, one for each branch of the root. One of these must be the boundary of \u2126. In other words, \u2126 is a pth root of a disc.\nRemark: the cavity in Figure 2 is a root of a disc.\nThe case of boundary measure |z|\u22122pdz can be reduced to the theorem which was just proved.\nCorollary 4. If \u2126 is a smooth bounded one-point quadrature domain with respect to the boundary measure |z|\u22122pdz, and if the origin is outside the closure of \u2126, then \u2126 is a pth root of a disc.\nProof. For some constant c and point z0 \u2208 \u2126 we have for all f \u2208 A\u221e(\u2126)\u222b \u2202\u2126 f(z) |z|2p dz = cf(z0).\nUsing the Cauchy formula on the right side and collecting terms to the left side, we have \u222b\n\u2202\u2126 f(z) ( 1 |z|2p \u2212 c 2\u03c0i(z \u2212 z0) ) dz = 0.\nBy orthogonality in the Hardy space, there exists H \u2208 A\u221e(\u2126) such that\n1\n|z|2p = H(z) +\nc\n2\u03c0i(z \u2212 z0) , z \u2208 \u2202\u2126.\nBy the Argument Principle, since the left side exhibits no winding of argument around the boundary of \u2126, the meromorphic function on the right side has as many roots as poles (namely one) in \u2126. So for some nonzero \u03be 6= z0 and nonvanishing function g \u2208 A\u221e(\u2126),\n|z|2p = 2\u03c0ic(z \u2212 z0) g(z)(z \u2212 \u03be) , z \u2208 \u2202\u2126.\nSince z = 0 is outside the closure of \u2126, we write\nzp\u22121z\u0304p = 2\u03c0ic(z \u2212 z0) g(z)(z \u2212 \u03be)z , z \u2208 \u2202\u2126.\nBy the Residue Theorem there is a constant C such that for all f \u2208 A\u221e(\u2126)\u222b \u2202\u2126 f(z)zp\u22121z\u0304pdz = Cf(\u03be), z \u2208 \u2202\u2126.\nUse Green\u2019s Theorem on the left hand side:\u222b \u2126 f(z)|z|2p\u22122dA = 2Cif(\u03be).\nIn other words, \u2126 is a one-point quadrature domain with respect to weighted area measure |z|2p\u22122dA, and we appeal to Theorem 3.\n3.2. Quadrature nodes at the origin.\nNow we consider one-point quadrature domains which contain the origin. In this case, if the origin is the quadrature node and the measure for quadrature is |z|2pdA, then the domain must be a disc.\nTheorem 5. If \u2126 is a smooth bounded one-point quadrature domain with respect to weighted area measure |z|2pdA whose quadrature node is the origin, then \u2126 is a disc centered at the origin.\nProof. We have in this case for all f analytic and smooth up to the boundary\u222b \u2126 f(z)|z|2pdA = cf(0).\nAs in the proofs above, use Green\u2019s theorem on the left to get an integral on the boundary, and rewrite the right side using the Cauchy formula, subtract, and use orthogonality in the Hardy space to conclude that for some H holomorphic and smooth up to the boundary of \u2126\nzpz\u0304p+1 = H(z) + c\n2\u03c0iz , z \u2208 \u2202\u2126.\nJust multiply by z and get\n|z|2p+2 = zH(z) + c 2\u03c0i , z \u2208 \u2202\u2126.\nThe rest is clear: the imaginary part of the holomorphic function on the right must be everywhere 0, so that |z|2p+2 is a real positive constant on the boundary of \u2126.\nThe corresponding case for boundary measure |z|\u22122pdz will reduce to the case of weighted area measure, but with quadrature node away from the origin.\nProposition 6. Let \u2126 be a smooth bounded one-point quadrature domain with respect to boundary measure |z|\u22122pdz, whose quadrature node is the origin. Then \u2126 is a one-point quadrature domain with respect to weighted area measure |z|2p\u22122dA, with quadrature node away from the origin.\nProof. The proof is very similar to that of Corollary 4, with 0 in place of z0. Arguing similarly, we arrive at\n1 |z|2p = h(z) z , z \u2208 \u2202\u2126.\nBy the argument principle, since the left side has no winding, the function h has exactly one root, at a point z0 6= 0. Thus for some nonvanishing analytic function g\n|z|2p = z g(z)(z \u2212 z0) , z \u2208 \u2202\u2126,\nor\nzp\u22121z\u0304p = 1\ng(z)(z \u2212 z0) , z \u2208 \u2202\u2126.\nNow integrate along the boundary, use Green\u2019s Theorem on the left hand side and the Residue Theorem on the right side, to conclude that for a constant C\u222b\n\u2126 f(z)|z|2p\u22122dA = Cf(z0).\n3.3. Domains containing 0, with quadrature node away from 0.\nWe turn to the case of a one-point quadrature domain with respect to |z|2pdA which contains the origin, but whose quadrature node is not the origin. For this case, under the assumption of simple-connectedness we will be able to describe the domain via a Riemann map.\nSo let \u2126 be a smooth bounded simply connected one-point quadrature domain with respect to |z|2pdA. Assume 0 \u2208 \u2126, but the quadrature node is z0 6= 0. For some constant c, \u222b\n\u2126 f(z)|z|2p = cf(z0)\nfor all f analytic and smooth up to the boundary. Notice that the function\nf(z)\u2212 \u2211p\u22121\nj=0 f (j)(0) j! z j zp\nis analytic and smooth up to the boundary. Thus\u222b \u2126 (f(z)\u2212 p\u22121\u2211 j=0 f (j)(0) j! zj)z\u0304pdA = kf(z0)\u2212 p\u22121\u2211 j=0 cjf (j)(0),\nfor some constants k, c0, c1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , cp\u22121. But now move the integrations of the terms under the summation sign to the right side and conclude that for some (different) constants \u03ba, d0, d1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , dp\u22121\u222b\n\u2126 f(z)z\u0304pdA = \u03baf(z0) + p\u22121\u2211 j=0 djf (j)(0).\nSince this quadrature identity will hold in the Bergman space, and since the left hand side is the Bergman space pairing \u3008f(z), zp\u3009, we have\nwp = \u03baK\u2126(w, z0) + p\u22121\u2211 j=0 dj \u2202jK\u2126(w, z) \u2202z\u0304j \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 z=0 , (3.2)\nwhere K\u2126(w, z) is the Bergman kernel function of \u2126.\nLet \u03d5 : D\u2192 \u2126 be a conformal map which takes 0 7\u2192 0. We use t to denote points in D. By the Bergman kernel transformation formula [7, 6] the above equality can be pulled back to the disc, in the form\n\u03d5\u2032(t)\u03d5(t)p = aKD(t, \u03b60) + p\u22121\u2211 j=0 bj \u2202jKD(t, \u03b6) \u2202\u03b6 j \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b6=0 ,\nfor some constants a, b0, b1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , bp\u22121. Since we know the Bergman kernel of the disc to be\nKD(t, \u03b6) = 1\n\u03c0(1\u2212 t\u03b6)2 ,\nwe have now for some constants \u03b1, \u03b20, \u03b21, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b2p\u22121\n(\u03d5(t)p+1)\u2032 = \u03b1\n(1\u2212 t\u03b60)2 + p\u22121\u2211 j=0 \u03b2jt j .\nThat means\n\u03d5(t)p+1 = P (t)\n1\u2212 t\u03b60 for some polynomial P (t) of degree at most p+ 1 such that P (0) = 0. Notice that the denominator has no roots in the disc, and the meromorphic function on the right must have an analytic (p+ 1)-th root. The origin must be a root of order exactly p+ 1, and consequently for some constant C and appropriately chosen branch for the root, we have\n\u03d5(t) = Ct\n(1\u2212 t\u03b60)1/p+1 . (3.3)\nTheorem 7. If \u2126 is a smooth bounded simply connected one-point quadrature domain for measure |z|2pdA whose quadrature node is not the origin, then \u2126 is the conformal image of the unit disc under a map of the form (3.3) with \u03b60 6= 0.\nRemarks. In view of Proposition 6, Theorem 7 applies to smooth bounded simply connected one-point quadrature domains for boundary measure |z|\u22122p\u22122dz whose quadrature node is the origin. In Figure 3 we see an example of such a quadrature domain.\nLastly we come to smooth bounded one-point quadrature domains for the boundary measure |z|\u22122pdz, with quadrature nodes away from the origin. It will again be possible to describe such domains using conformal mapping under the assumption of simple connectedness.\nLet \u2126 be such a domain, for which\u222b \u2202\u2126 f(z) |z|2p dz = cf(z0),\nfor some constant c and point 0 6= z0 \u2208 \u2126, and for all f \u2208 A\u221e(\u2126). Using Cauchy\u2019s formula, orthogonality in the Hardy Space, and the Argument Principle in the way we have several times above, this means that for some nonvanishing g \u2208 A\u221e(\u2126) and \u03be \u2208 \u2126, \u03be 6= z0,\n|z|2p = z \u2212 z0 g(z)(z \u2212 \u03be) , z \u2208 \u2202\u2126.\nWe now distinguish two cases, where \u03be 6= 0 and \u03be = 0. In the first case, the boundary equality\nz\u0304p = z \u2212 z0\ng(z)(z \u2212 \u03be)zp , z \u2208 \u2202\u2126\ntogether with Green\u2019s Theorem gives\u222b \u2126 f(z)z\u0304p\u22121dA = \u03b1f(\u03be) + p\u22121\u2211 j=0 \u03b2jf (j)(0) (3.4)\nfor some constants \u03b1, \u03b2j , j = 0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , p\u2212 1. But now zp\u22121 is a linear combination of Bergman kernel functions, similar to what occurred in 3.2. Letting \u03d5(t) be a conformal map from the unit disc to \u2126 taking 0 7\u2192 0, we have on the disc\n\u03d5\u2032(t)\u03d5(t)p\u22121 = k\n(1\u2212 \u03c9\u03b60) + p\u22121\u2211 j=0 djt j ,\nwhere k, dj are constants. And so for a polynomial P (t) of degree at most p + 1 vanishing at the origin,\n\u03d5(t)p = P (t)\n1\u2212 t\u03b60 .\nFor the right side to admit an analytic pth root, we need P (t) = atp + btp+1 for some constants a, b with |a/b| > 1. And so we determine\n\u03d5(t) = t ( a+ bt 1\u2212 t\u03b6\u03040 )1/p . (3.5)\nNow, consider the case where \u03be = 0. The argument begins the same way, using \u03be = 0; but now instead of (3.4) we get\u222b\n\u2126 f(z)z\u0304p\u22121dA = \u03b1f(\u03be) + p\u2211 j=0 \u03b2jf (j)(0)\nfor some constants \u03b1, \u03b2j (note the upper index on the sum has changed). Now use the Bergman kernel with similar reasoning as above, to conclude that a conformal map from the unit disc to \u2126 taking 0 7\u2192 0 will be of the form\n\u03d5(t) = t (a+ bt+ ct2\n1\u2212 t\u03b60\n)1/p (3.6)\nfor some constants a, b, c such that the roots of the quadratic function in the numerator have modulus greater than 1.\nTheorem 8. If \u2126 is a smooth bounded simply connected one-point quadrature domain for the boundary measure |z|\u22122pdz, with 0 \u2208 \u2126 but 0 not the quadrature node, then \u2126 is the conformal image of the unit disc under a map of form (3.5) or (3.6)."

The case of Q(z) = C|z|2p\nOn the plane with external field Q(z) = C|z|2p with C > 0, the support SQ of the equilibrium measure \u00b5Q is the closed disc DR(0) centered at the origin with radius R := (2pC)\u22121/2p (see [25] Theorem IV.6.1).\nThe equilibrium support SV in the plane in the presence of V (z) := (1 + q)Q(z) + q ln |z\u2212 z0|\u22121 will depend on z0 and q. If z0 is internal to SQ and if q is small enough, then a cavity will form. On the other hand, if q is large or z0 is far from SQ, then a cavity does not form.\nTheorem 9. Consider the external field Q(z) = C|z|2p in the plane, C > 0, p \u2208 N. Let V (z) := (1 + q)Q(z) + q ln |z\u2212 z0|\u22121, where q > 0 and z0 \u2208 C. Let SV := supp(\u00b5V ) and SQ := supp(\u00b5Q) be the supports of the equilibrium measures \u00b5V , \u00b5Q respectively. Then SQ is the closed disc centered at the origin of radius R = (2pC) \u2212 1 2p . We have\nd\u00b5Q = \u2206Q 2\u03c0 dA \u2223\u2223 SQ ,\nd\u00b5V = (1 + q)\u2206Q 2\u03c0 dA \u2223\u2223 SV .\nThe support SV is described as follows:\n(i) If a cavity forms so that SV = SQ\\\u2126 for an open set \u2126 \u2282 SQ, and if 0 /\u2208 \u2126, then \u2126 is a pth root of a disc.\n(ii) If a cavity forms so that SV = SQ\\\u2126 for a smooth open set \u2126 \u2282 SQ, where 0 \u2208 \u2126, then \u2126 is a conformal image of the unit disc under a map \u03d5 : D \u2192 \u2126 of the form \u03d5(t) = At\n(1\u2212t\u03b60)1/p , with A a constant and \u03b60 6= 0 .\n(iii) If z0 = 0, then SV is an annulus.\n(iv) If SV is smooth and simply connected, and if 0 \u2208 SV is an interior point, then let ScV := C\u0302\\SV be the exterior of SV . Let (ScV )\u2217 be the image of ScV under the conformal mapping z 7\u2192 z\u22121. Then (ScV )\u2217 is the image of the unit disc under a conformal map \u03d5 : D \u2192 (ScV )\u2217 of the form \u03d5(t) = t ( P (t) 1\u2212t\u03b60 )1/p , where P (t) is a polynomial of degree at most 2.\nA few remarks are in order. Note that (iii) is a consequence of ([25] Section IV.6). In (iv), if 0 /\u2208 \u2126, then use instead the mapping z \u2192 (z \u2212 \u03b1)\u22121, where \u03b1 is an interior point SV , and analyze as in the previous section. Finally, we emphasize the assumptions of smoothness and simple connectedness. In the next subsection, we show how the case (i) can be verified by direct computation.\nIf instead of a single point source we add several to the background field Q(z), then we can draw some conclusions about what happens in case a cavity forms. For the next theorem, consider the external field Q(z) = C|z|2p in the plane, C > 0, p \u2208 N. Let V (z) := (1 + q)Q(z) + \u2211n j=1 qj ln |z \u2212 zj |\u22121 where q = \u2211n j=1 qj . Here qj > 0,\nj = 1, 2, . . . , n, and |zj | < (2pC)\u22121/2p, j = 1, 2, . . . , n. Set rj := \u221a\nqj 2C(1+qj) and define\n\u2126j to be that component of {z \u2208 C : |zp \u2212 zpj | < rj} which contains zj . (Note that \u2126j is a pth root of a disc.)\nTheorem 10. With definitions as above, suppose that SV is of the form SQ\\\u2126 for an open set \u2126 \u2282 SQ.\n(i) \u2126 is a union of quadrature domains for weighted area measure |z|2p\u22122dA. The quadrature nodes involved are the points zj.\n(ii) If for each j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n we have rj < |zj |p and |zpj | + rj < (2pC)\u22121/2, and the \u2126j are mutually disjoint, then \u2126 = \u222anj=1\u2126j .\nPart (i) is immediate from part (i) of Theorem 1. Part (ii) says that for sufficiently weak point sources in the interior of SQ, the cavity is a union of pth roots of discs around the point sources. This can be verified by computing from Frostman\u2019s theorem similar to what will be shown in the next subsection.\nKhavinson and Lundberg in [19], Exercise 22.3a, point out that Cassini ovals OT := {z \u2208 C : |z2 \u2212 1| < T}, T > 1, are two-node quadrature domains for weighted area measure |z|2dA. One can show that such OT are the cavities that occur in the support SV of the equilibrium measure in the presence of V (z) := (1+2q)C|z|4 +q ln |z\u22121|\u22121 + q ln |z + 1|\u22121, when the constant C is small enough and q is large enough. In slightly more generality, we have the following.\nExample. Consider the external field Q(z) = C|z|2p in the plane, where C < 1/2p. The corresponding equilibrium measure support SQ is the closed disc centered at the origin of radius (2pC)\u22121/2p. Let \u03c9 = exp(2\u03c0i/p), and place point sources of equal intensity q > 0 at the pth roots of unity. So consider the external field V (z) =\n(1 + pq)Q(z) + q \u2211p\u22121 j=0 ln |z \u2212 \u03c9j |\u22121. Denote T := T (q) = \u221a q 2C(1+pq) and OT := {z \u2208 C : |zp \u2212 1| < T}. Then for all q > 0 such that 1 + T (q) < (2pC)\u22121/2, the equilibrium support SV is SQ\\OT .\nNotice that for 0 < q < 2C/(1\u2212 2pC), OT is a union of pth roots of discs around the pth roots of unity. When q = 2C/(1\u2212 2pC), the closure of OT becomes connected as the roots of discs meet at the origin. For all values q > 2C/(1 \u2212 2pC) such that T (q) < (2pC)\u22121/2 \u2212 1, the set OT is a lemniscate which generalizes the Cassini ovals pointed out in [19] Exercise 22.3a. If q is large enough so that T (q) > (2pC)\u22121/2 \u2212 1, then SV is no longer determined by a cavity (since OT is no longer compactly contained in SQ). Figure 4 demonstrates the cases of p = 2, 3.\nThis example is related to the fact that polynomial lemniscates are quadrature domains with respect to (unweighted) equilibrium measure on the boundary of the lemniscate. One interpretation of the cavity above is that for the lemniscate OT , the unweighted equilibrium measure on the boundary matches the balayage of the weighted area measure 1+q2\u03c0 \u2206QdA \u2223\u2223 OT onto the boundary \u2202OT . (See [25], [19].)\n4.2. Cavity by direct computation\nAlthough we have assumed smoothness above, in the case of a cavity our result can be verified by directly computing the weighted potential and using Frostman\u2019s theorem. In fact this can be done in a more general setting which we now describe.\nSuppose that Q(z) is an admissible external field, and that \u03d5(z) is a complex analytic function such that Q(z) = C|\u03d5(z)|2p for z near z0, where z0 is an interior point of the support SQ of the equilibrium measure \u00b5Q. Assume furthermore that 0 6= d\u03d5p/dz|z=z0 . (Here \u03d5p(z) designates the pth power, and not p iterations of the function.)\nNote that \u03d5p is univalent in a neighborhood of z0, and so has a local inverse \u03c8 defined in a neighborhood of \u03d5p(z0). Let r := \u221a q 2C(1+q) , and let q be small enough so that \u03c8 is defined on the disc Dr(\u03c6 p(z0)) of radius r centered at \u03d5\np(z0), and so that \u2126 := \u03c8(Dr(\u03d5\np(z0))) is compactly contained in SQ. We contend that for small q > 0, the equilibrium measure \u00b5V in the plane in the presence of the external field V (z) = (1 + q)Q(z) + q ln |z \u2212 z0|\u22121 has support SV := SQ\\\u2126.\nTo proceed, define a weighted potential F (z) as in Frostman\u2019s Theorem:\nF (z) := 1 + q\n2\u03c0 \u222b SV \u2206Q(w) ln 1 |w \u2212 z| dAw + (1 + q)Q(z) + q ln\n1\n|z \u2212 z0| .\nWrite F (z) = F1(z) + F2(z) where F1, F2 are defined as\nF1(z) := 1 + q\n2\u03c0 \u222b SQ \u2206Q(w) ln 1 |w \u2212 z| dAw + (1 + q)Q(z),\nF2(z) := q ln 1 |z \u2212 z0| \u2212 (1 + q)C 2\u03c0 \u222b \u2126 4p2|\u03d5p\u22121(w)\u03d5\u2032(w)|2 ln 1 |w \u2212 z| dAw\nBy Frostman\u2019s theorem, F1(z) is a constant C1 for z \u2208 SV and F1(z) \u2265 C1 elsewhere (quasi-everywhere). As for F2, we need to compute the potential occurring from \u2126. Observe that p2|\u03d5p\u22121(w)\u03d5\u2032(w)|2 is the Jacobian determinant of the map w 7\u2192 \u03d5p(w). By changing variables the integral over \u2126 occurring in F2 is\n4C(1 + q)\n2\u03c0\n\u222b Dr(\u03d5p(z0)) ln 1 |\u03c8(t)\u2212 z| dAt.\nWhen z is outside \u2126, this can be evaluated by the harmonic mean value property, yielding q ln |z \u2212 z0|\u22121. When z is in the closure of \u2126, we rewrite the integral as\n4C(1 + q)\n2\u03c0\n( \u222b Dr(\u03d5p(z0)) ln |t\u2212 \u03d5p(z)| |\u03c8(t)\u2212 z| dAt + \u222b Dr(\u03d5p(z0)) ln 1 |t\u2212 \u03d5p(z)| dAt ) .\nThe first term can be calculated by the mean value theorem. The second term represents the potential formed by a disc of uniform charge, which is well known. This gives\nq ln |\u03d5p(z0)\u2212 \u03d5p(z)| |z0 \u2212 z| + q( 1 2 \u2212 ln(r))\u2212 q 2 |\u03d5p(z0)\u2212 \u03d5p(z)|2 r2 .\nHence\nF2(z) = { 0, z /\u2208 \u2126 q ln r|\u03d5p(z0)\u2212\u03d5p(z)| + q 2(\u22121 + |\u03d5p(z0)\u2212\u03d5p(z)|2 r2 ), z \u2208 \u2126 .\nFrom here it can be verified by calculus that F2(z) > 0 for z \u2208 \u2126. That means F (z) is itself equal to the constant C1 on SV , and F (z) \u2265 C1 for all z /\u2208 SV . We conclude by Frostman\u2019s theorem that \u00b5V = 1+q 2\u03c0 \u2206QdA \u2223\u2223 SQ\\\u2126 , and indeed SV = SQ\\\u2126.\nTheorem 11. Let Q(z) be an admissible external field and let the support of the equilibrium measure in the plane in the presence of Q(z) be SQ. Let z0 be an interior point of SQ and assume that in a neighborhood of z0, Q(z) = C|\u03d5(z)|2p where \u03d5 is a complex analytic function such that \u03d5(z0) and \u03d5\n\u2032(z0) are nonzero, p is a natural number, and C > 0. Setting r = \u221a q/2C(1 + q), we have that for all q > 0 sufficiently small, the support SV of the equilibrium measure in the plane in the presence of the external field V (z) = (1 + q)Q(z) + q ln |z \u2212 z0|\u22121 is SV = SQ\\\u2126, where \u2126 := \u03c8(Dr(\u03d5p(z0))), with Dr(\u03d5 p(z0)) being the disc of radius r centered at \u03d5 p(z0), and \u03c8 being the (local) inverse of \u03d5p.\nRemark. In Theorem 11 \u2018sufficiently small\u2019 means small enough such that \u03c8 exists on Dr(\u03d5 p(z0)) and \u03c8(Dr(\u03d5 p(z0)) is compactly contained in SQ."
