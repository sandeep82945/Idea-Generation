    "abstractText": "Abstract Amyloidosis is triggered by the truncation of amyloid precursor proteins, causing organ damages. While previous studies found the truncation of amyloid A (AA) and amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) occurs in Cand N-terminal, respectively, the detailed mechanism of the fibril formation remains unclear. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry is usually applied for a qualitative purpose, and thus quantification of tryptic peptide residue is difficult. We therefore employed a mass spectrometry-based quantification by isotope-labeled cell-free (MS-QBIC) to analyze the truncation processes in amyloid fibrillogenesis of AA and ATTR using the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of autopsy cases. In this study, the process of transthyretin from an 'early fibril state' consisting of full-length ATTR to a 'mature ATTR amyloid fibril' with a truncated low-amyloidogenic segment has been mathematically revealed. The amount of full-length ATTR was nine times higher than in mature fibers. Large cohort studies using MS-QBIC may shed light on the clinical significance of amyloid fibrils.",

Currently, the number of identified amyloid fibril proteins is 42, of which 18 proteins appear as systemic amyloidosis\u00a0[1]. Amyloid A (AA) and amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) are relatively common amyloid subtypes, but the mechanism or the structure of amyloid fibril formation remain unclear.\nWe previously applied the mass spectrometry-based quantification by isotope-labeled cell-free product (MS-QBIC) to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues of 30 autopsy cases with amyloidosis, including seven AA cases and nine ATTR cases\u00a0[2]. This quantification approach, the MS-QBIC method uses absolutely quantified isotope-labeled peptides as the quantification control. (Supplemental Fig.\u00a01) [3, 4]. Therefore, differences in ionization efficiency due to differences in peptide sequence do not, in principle, affect the quantitative value (if the peptide to be measured is quantifiable). Note that quantification values were given within the range where the signal value changes linear to the amount of spiked MS-QBIC peptides[2]. This approach has been feasible and useful in classification and analysis of systemic amyloidosis. Herein, we successfully quantified the truncation processes involved in amyloid fibrillogenesis of AA and ATTR by using MS-QBIC. * Yukako Shintani-Domoto yukakoshintani@gmail.com 1 Department of\u00a0Diagnostic Pathology, Nippon Medical School Hospital, 1\u20101\u20105, Sendagi, Bunkyo\u2010ku, Tokyo\u00a0113\u20108603, Japan 2 Department of\u00a0Systems Pharmacology, Graduate School of\u00a0Medicine, The University of\u00a0Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan 3 Department of\u00a0Cardiovascular Medicine, The University of\u00a0Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo, Japan 4 Department of\u00a0Pathology, Graduate School of\u00a0Medicine, The University of\u00a0Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan 5 Laboratory for\u00a0Synthetic Biology, RIKEN Center for\u00a0Biosystems Dynamics Research, Suita, Osaka, Japan\n6 Department of\u00a0Integrated Diagnostic Pathology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan\n1 3\nSerum amyloid A (SAA) consists of 104 amino acids. Native SAA, which adopts a unique four-helix bundle fold stabilized by its long C-terminal tail, exists as a hexamer. The C-terminus of SAA is presumed to be truncated in AA amyloid fibrils; however, it remains unclear whether the C-terminus is genuinely absent or present at an under-detection level. Using MS-QBIC, amino acids (aa) 26\u201334 and aa 91\u2013103 of SAA peptides were quantified. Aa 26\u201334 was detected in all 14 AA samples, whereas the C-terminal aa 91\u2013103 were detected in only six AA samples, illustrating that the average aa 26\u201334/aa 91\u2013103 ratio was only 4.91% (0.95%\u20138.24%) among these six samples (Fig.\u00a01A, B). This result indicates that the C-terminus is almost absent or may be present in minimal amounts in amyloid deposits. The length of SAA fragments detected in the amyloid fibrils varies and is dependent on the cases and/or the methods employed, shown by a previous study reporting fragments ranging from aa 2\u201321 to 2\u201386\u00a0[5]. We recently showed that the distribution of C-terminal tryptic peptides differed from that of N-terminal tryptic peptides in FFPE specimens of AA patients using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry\u00a0[6]. These results demonstrated that the N-terminus plays a critical role in forming AA amyloid fibrils, consistent with the previous report\u00a0[5]. A possible mechanism for this fibril formation was the activity of an endogenous protease, but the roles of C-terminal peptides in this process require further investigation.\nTransthyretin (TTR) consists of 127 amino acids. By using cryo-electron microscopy, Schmidt et\u00a0al. investigated the misfolding mechanism of TTR, i.e. that aa 36\u201356 is proteolytically\ndegraded during the process from \u201cearly fibril state\u201d to \u201cmature ATTR amyloid fibril\u201d\u00a0[7]. This early fibril state consists of fulllength ATTR and contains the low amyloidogenic segment at aa 36\u201356 in a solvent-exposed conformation. In our study, we have quantified two tryptic peptides; aa 22\u201334 and aa 36\u201348 of ATTR (Fig.\u00a02A, B) that were detected in 47 of 48 samples, with an average aa 36\u201348/aa 22\u201334 ratio of 10.26% (2.45%\u201326.67%), respectively. Quantitative values of aa 36\u201348 indicated the amount of mature ATTR amyloid fibrils is 9 times larger than the early fibril state (Fig.\u00a02C), supporting the hypothesis of TTR misfolding, proposed by Schmidt et\u00a0al. [7].\nATTR has two main fibril morphologies in amyloid fibrils\u00a0[8]. Type A fibrils are common and consist of N-terminally truncated and full-length TTR. Type B fibrils are formed from only a few mutational variants of TTR and primarily consist of only full-length ATTR. In our study, aa 36\u201348 is significantly less common than aa 22\u201334, suggesting that all cases are likely to be ATTR type A. Ihse et\u00a0al. reported that patients with ATTR fragments (type A) have a late onset of amyloidosis and are more likely to develop cardiomyopathy, while patients without fragments (type B) have an early onset of amyloidosis with a higher incidence of neuropathy and a lower incidence of myocardial involvement [9]. The clinical feature of type A and type B, classified according to the length pattern of amyloid fibrils, is thus markedly different. Large cohort studies using our method may provide new insights into the clinical significance of amyloid fibrils.\nA\nB Average of Estimated peptide concentration (n=3)\n(pmol/mm3)\nHeart Another organ\naa 91-103 (DPNHFRPAGLPEK)\naa 26-34 (EANYIGSDK)\n0100200300 0 100 200 300\nAnother organ\nAdrenal gland\nStomach\nSalivary gland\nThyroid\nKidney\nThyroid\nTongue\n#1 59 F\n#2 78 F\n#3 71 F\n#4 48 M\n#5 64 M\n#6 49 F\n#7 75 F\n5.0%\n5.4%\n4.8%\n8.2%\n0.0%\n0.0%\n5.1%\n0.9%\n0.0%\n0.0%\n0.0%\n0.0%\n0.0%\n0.0%\nCase Age M/F\nPeptide ratio\nPeptide ratio\nFig. 1 Amino acid sequence and quantitative value of human Serum amyloid A (SAA) peptides.

Two peptides, aa 22\u201334 (black and bold) and aa 36\u201348 (red and bold), which were detected using absolute quantification by LC\u2013MS in our previous study\u00a0 [2] are enclosed in the boxes.

The bar graph shows the average of three measurements. In our quantification study, two tryptic peptides; aa 22\u201334 and aa 36\u201348 of TTR were successfully.
