During a merger between two massi ve galaxies, he evolution of the two central SMBHs can be decomposed into three ajor stages (Begelman, Blandford & Rees 1980 ): (i) at kpc scale eparation, due to dynamical friction, the SMBHs lose their orbital nergy and angular momentum, sink towards the centre of the galaxy erger remnant, and form a gravitationally bound binary; (ii) at pc cales, the SMBH binary continues to shrink by interacting with as (e.g. circumbinary disc, Haiman, Kocsis & Menou 2009 ) and ndividual stars (e.g. slingshot interactions between the binary and tars, Hills & Fullerton 1980 ); (iii) at mpc scales, the SMBH binary ynamics is dominated by the gravitational wave (GW) emission ntil coalescence.

In order to offer better heoretical predictions for these GW experiments and to maximize heir scientific returns, it is of paramount importance to impro v e the\nodelling of BH formation and evolution in a cosmological context f galaxy formation while simultaneously resolving the small-scale ynamics of BH binaries (e.g. Amaro-Seoane et al. 2022 ). In cosmological galaxy formation simulations, because of the imited spatial and mass resolution, the sub-pc-scale BH accretion isc is not resolved and BH evolution is modelled in a subgrid pproach as follows:\n(i) BH accretion and AGN feedback. BH accretion is typically mplemented using the Bondi\u2013Hoyle\u2013Lyttleton (BHL, Hoyle & yttleton 1939 ; Bondi & Hoyle 1944 ; Bondi 1952 ) accretion model. he BHL model was first introduced into galaxy formation simuations by Di Matteo, Springel & Hernquist ( 2005 ) and Springel, i Matteo & Hernquist ( 2005 ) and it has been adopted in many ater large simulation projects such as Illustris (Vogelsberger et al. 013 ), EAGLE (Schaye et al. 2015 ), Illustris TNG (Weinberger et al. 017 ; Pillepich et al. 2018 ), Auriga (Grand et al. 2017 ) amongst thers. In addition, there are also other accretion models, e.g. the ravitational torque-driven accretion model (Hopkins & Quataert 011 ; Angl \u0301es-Alc \u0301azar et al. 2017 ; Dav \u0301e et al. 2019 ), the transport f angular momentum model (Debuhr, Quataert & Ma 2011 , 2012 ), nd the accretion disc particle model (Power, Nayakshin & King 011 ). In different implementations of AGN feedback, BHs can heat he surrounding gas via thermal feedback (e.g. Springel et al. 2005 ; ooth & Schaye 2009 ; Johansson, Naab & Burkert 2009a ; Teyssier t al. 2011 ; Schaye et al. 2015 ; Blank et al. 2019 ; Tremmel et al. 019 ; Ni et al. 2022 ), or kick surrounding gas elements by jets/winds hrough kinetic feedback, or adopt multiple feedback mechanisms e.g. Choi et al. 2012 ; Debuhr, Quataert & Ma 2012 ; Dubois et al. 012 ; Barai et al. 2014 ; Costa, Sijacki & Haehnelt 2014 ; Angl \u0301eslc \u0301azar et al. 2017 ; Weinberger et al. 2017 ; Dav \u0301e et al. 2019 ). See abouzit et al. ( 2021 ) and Habouzit et al. ( 2022 ) for comparisons f the AGN feedback models in some large-scale cosmological imulations.\n(ii) BH dynamics. Due to the softened gravitational interaction, mall-scale BH dynamics is not resolved in standard galaxy foration simulations, especially for low-mass BHs and at the scales f the BH binary phase. Instead, BHs are typically repositioned to he local potential minima assuming that the unresolved dynamical riction can efficiently keep BHs near galaxy centres (e.g. Springel t al. 2005 ; Johansson et al. 2009a ; Bah \u0301e et al. 2022 ). In addiion, the two BHs are merged instantaneously if their separation nd relative velocity satisfy some given criteria. For example, in pringel et al. ( 2005 ), two BHs are merged if their separation s less than the BH smoothing length (usually kpc or sub-kpc cales) which is defined using the smoothed particle hydrodynamcs approach and their relativ e v elocity is below the local sound peed.\nAs a result, the three-stage BH coalescence process is not fully esolved in standard cosmological simulations. Although there have een some impro v ements in resolving BH dynamics at kpc or subpc scales by introducing dynamical friction subgrid modelling to eplace the repositioning scheme (e.g. Tremmel et al. 2015 ; Pfister t al. 2019 ; Chen et al. 2022a ; Ma et al. 2023 ), the evolution beyond he formation of a bound BH binary and the resulting GW predictions sually have to be modelled by post-processing the simulation data\nNRAS 520, 4463\u20134489 (2023)\nith semi-analytical prescriptions (e.g. Salcido et al. 2016 ; Kelley, lecha & Hernquist 2017 ; Katz et al. 2020 ; Volonteri et al. 2020 ; hen et al. 2022b ; Li et al. 2022 ). Recently, there have also been attempts to resolve the entire\nH coalescence process in cosmological simulations. Khan et al. 2016 ) selected two merging disc galaxies in a group environment rom the Argo cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamical simulation Feldmann & Mayer 2015 ) and resimulated the evolution of the ery central region with their direct N -body code \u03c6-GPU until the wo BHs coalesce. To do so, they had to manually convert all gas articles into stars before the onset of the direct N -body simulation see similar approaches in Khan et al. 2012b , 2018 ). Moreo v er, the y id not include BH accretion and AGN feedback modelling in both he parent hydrodynamical simulation and the resimulations. These v ersimplified approximations make their approach not fully selfonsistent, and how these simplifications affect the simulated BH ynamics is unknown. Recently, Mannerkoski et al. ( 2021 , 2022 ) perormed cosmological zoom-in simulations of galaxy groups which esolve BH dynamics down to separations of tens of Schwarzschild adii while simultaneously modelling the galaxy formation processes e.g. cooling, star formation, stellar and AGN feedback). These more elf-consistent simulations enable us to study the evolution of both H binary and triplet systems, the impacts of GW recoiling velocity n BH\u2013galaxy scaling relations, and the GW signatures from BH ergers. In the simulations of Mannerkoski et al. ( 2021 , 2022 ), given that ost of the BH binaries are in a gas-poor environment and their ccretion rates are in general low, the authors still adopted the raditional BHL accretion and isotropic thermal feedback model, hich was originally introduced for single BHs. When simulating H binaries in gas-rich galaxy mergers, the gas accretion rates can e significantly higher, and the BH model should be impro v ed to roperly take into account the BH binary phase. Note that this is articularly important for modelling LISA targets, i.e. BHs with asses in the range of 10 3 \u201310 7 M up to z \u223c 20 (Amaro-Seoane t al. 2022 ), as these low-mass and high-redshift BH mergers usually eside in gas-rich galaxies.\nDuring the evolution of a BH binary, the gas from the circumuclear disc (e.g. Escala et al. 2005 ; Dotti et al. 2007 ; Mayer et al. 007 ) forms a circumbinary disc centred at the binary centre of ass (CoM), leading to a different accretion behaviour compared o the single BH case (see Lai & Mu \u0303 noz 2022 , for a re vie w). or e xample, small-scale viscous hydrodynamical simulations of ircumbinary discs have revealed that during the BH binary phase, here is a preferential accretion on to the secondary BH, i.e. the ong-term accretion rate of the secondary BH is higher than that f the primary BH (e.g. Artymowicz & Lubow 1996 ; Hayasaki, ineshige & Sudou 2007 ; Farris et al. 2014 ; Duffell et al. 2020 ; u \u0303 noz et al. 2020 ). In contrast, in the BHL model, the BH accretion ate is proportional to the squared BH mass and thus it is higher or the more massive BH. These two models lead to two opposite utcomes: a binary in the circumbinary disc accretion model tends o be equal-mass, while a binary in the BHL model evolves towards larger mass ratio. This has an important impact on the simulation redictions since the BH mass ratio is one of the key parameters hat affects the GW-induced recoil velocity (Campanelli et al. 2007 ; aker et al. 2008 ; Lousto & Zlochower 2009 ; Zlochower & Lousto 015 ). Therefore, an impro v ed BH accretion and feedback model eeds to be developed for simulating BH binaries in a gas-rich nvironment.\nIn this work, we introduce a BH binary accretion and feedback odel which incorporates the results from small-scale circumbinary\nd m s d ( w i O f i\n2\n2\nT G i M e b g i r u a r m ( (\n2\nT p e t w a ( e t p i\nc w s m c s i a t e\n2\nO f 2 (\ns r e\nC s p c S i r a c t\ne t p m a p w\n\u2265 n i p b\np\nw t c\nI f fl ( f w a l w s m\n( t s a e d a S S t r o 1\n(\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/520/3/4463/7031773 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nisc simulations in a subgrid approach, and use gas-rich disc galaxy ergers to test and demonstrate the behaviour of the model. The tructure of our paper is as follows. In Section 2 , we describe the etails of our numerical code and the galaxy formation subgrid model i.e. gas cooling, star formation, and stellar feedback). In Section 3 , e introduce the BH accretion and feedback models. The simulation nitial conditions and the simulation details are described in Section 4 . ur results are presented in Section 5 . We discuss the caveats and uture impro v ements of our model in Section 6 and finally conclude n Section 7 .\nN U M E R I C A L C O D E\n.1 The KETJU code\nhe KETJU code (Rantala et al. 2017 ) extends the widely used ADGET-3 code (Springel 2005 ) by replacing the standard leapfrog\nntegration with the high-accuracy algorithmically regularized STAR integrator (Rantala et al. 2020 ) in selected regions around ach BH. All gravitational interactions in the regularized regions etween BHs, and BHs and star particles, are computed without ravitational softening, whereas star\u2013star interactions are softened n order to a v oid energy errors when particles enter and exit the e gularized re gions. The standard gadget leapfrog inte grator is also sed for integrating the CoM motion of the regularized regions, s well as all the other simulation particles outside the regularized egions. In order to model the effects of general relativity on the otion of the BHs, the KETJU code also includes post-Newtonian PN) corrections for BH\u2013BH interactions up to the order of PN3.5 Mora & Will 2004 ).\n.2 Hydrodynamics\nhe hydrodynamics is modelled using the modern SPHGAL smooth article hydrodynamics (SPH) implementation developed by Hu t al. ( 2014 ). In this model, the SPH calculation is performed using he pressure-entropy formulation utilizing a Wendland C 4 kernel ith N ngb = 100 neighbouring particles, and also includes a new rtificial viscosity scheme with a stronger viscosity coefficient limiter Cullen & Dehnen 2010 ) and the artificial conduction of thermal nergy (Read & Hayfield 2012 ). Together, these impro v ements help o better resolve the fluid mixing at contact discontinuities and revent the development of feedback-induced viscous instabilities n isolated disc galaxy simulations.\nIn addition, the SPHGAL model also uses sophisticated time-step ontrol by restricting the time-steps of neighbouring SPH particles ithin a factor of few (we use 4 in this study) for particles undergoing trong shocks (Saitoh & Makino 2009 ). In addition, the SPHGAL odel adopts the time-step limiter proposed by Durier & Dalla Vechia ( 2012 ) when modelling feedback processes. Thus, when BHs or tars inject thermal or kinetic feedback energy to SPH particles, the nacti ve energy-recei ving SPH particles will immediately become ctive and shorten their time-steps. This is necessary to ensure that he system reacts to energy inputs promptly and achieves proper nergy conservation.\n.3 Gas cooling, star formation, and stellar feedback\nur adopted model for gas cooling, star formation, and stellar eedback was originally developed by Scannapieco et al. ( 2005 , 006 ) and later impro v ed by Aumer et al. ( 2013 ) and N \u0301u \u0303 nez et al. 2017 ). It has been tested and used both in isolated galaxy and merger\nimulations (Eisenreich et al. 2017 ; Lah \u0301en et al. 2018 ), and more ecently also in cosmological zoom-in simulations (Mannerkoski t al. 2021 , 2022 ).\nIn this model, the abundances of 11 chemical elements (H, He, , N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ca, and Fe) are traced for every gas and\ntar particle in the simulation, with the cooling rate for each gas article depending on its current temperature, density, and chemical omposition. The cooling rate tables are adopted from Wiersma, chaye & Smith ( 2009 ) assuming that the gas is optically thin and in onization equilibrium embedded in the redshift-dependent UV/Xay background from quasars and galaxies (Haardt & Madau 2001 ) nd the cosmic microwave background. In this study, we use the ooling table calculated with the z = 0 background with a lower emperature limit of T = 10 4 K.\nDuring the simulation, the metal abundances for gas particles volve due to the metal enrichment from stellar feedback and the urbulent diffusion of metals (Aumer et al. 2013 ). Note that as gas articles keep receiving metals from stars during the simulation, the asses of some gas particles can reach twice the initial mass. To keep relatively uniform mass resolution, we split such an o v ermassiv e gas article into two gas particles and record the splitting history so that e can trace the evolution of baryonic particles in our simulations. Stars form stochastically from gas particles with densities \u03c1gas 2.2 \u00d7 10 \u221224 g cm \u22123 (or equi v alently hydrogen number densities H \u2265 1 cm \u22123 ) and with temperatures T \u2264 12 000 K which reside n convergent flows, i.e. the velocity divergence \u2207 \u00b7 v gas \u2264 0. The robability of converting a gas particle into a star particle is given y\nSF = SFR t t dyn\n= SFR t \u221a 4 \u03c0G\u03c1gas , (1)\nhere SFR = 0.02 is the star formation efficiency, t is the size of he time-step, t dyn is the dynamical time, and G is the gravitational onstant.\nWe consider the stellar feedback from the explosions of Type a (SNIa) and Type II (SNII) supernovae and the slow winds rom asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. When a star particle is agged for feedback, it enriches, heats (thermal feedback), and kicks kinetic feedback) the closest 10 neighbouring gas particles. The ractions of the metals and energy that a gas neighbour receives are eighted by the SPH smoothing kernel of the star particle. To a v oid dding feedback mass and energy to gas particles at unphysically arge distances when there are not enough nearby gas particles, e introduce a maximum radius of r max , = 2 kpc to the neighbour earch (see Hopkins et al. 2018 , for a similar implementation of a aximum search radius). Each star particle represents a stellar population with a Kroupa 2001 ) initial mass function. To estimate the SNII rates, we assume hat stars more massive than 8 M end their lives as SNII. As massive tars have fairly short lifetimes ( 10 7 yr ), we simply assume that fter the formation of a star particle, all SNII in this star particle xplode at the same age of \u03c4SNII = 3 Myr . In contrast, CO white warf binary systems, which are the SNIa progenitors, can explode t very different ages. For a star particle in the simulation, the first NIa explodes at the age of \u03c4SNIa , min = 50 Myr , and the following NIa feedback events are performed every 50 Myr until a maximum ime period of \u03c4 SNIa, max = 10 Gyr is reached. To estimate the SNIa ates, we adopt a delay time distribution, which declines with the age f the star particle as \u03c4\u22121 , and the normalization of two SNIa per 000 M of formed stars following Maoz & Mannucci ( 2012 ). When a star particle undergoes a supernova feedback event SNII or SNIa), mass is ejected with an outflow velocity of v SN =\nMNRAS 520, 4463\u20134489 (2023)\nM\n4 s\nE\nw ( W\nt n p f t t t a t g f r w l 3 r w t W a\nm m t e d a o\n3\n3\nI 1 m\nM\nw g b u s l f i\nr\nM\nw\nM\nw t t\nu\nM\nT\nL u p p\np\nw r \u2212 B\nw a n t f p 0\nt \u2264 t i o\n3\nW t l g i w w a r r a f a 1 t M c t h i\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/520/3/4463/7031773 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\n000 km s \u22121 to the gas neighbours, resulting in a total energy of the upernova feedback event of\nSN = 1 2 m ej v 2 SN , (2)\nhere m ej is the ejected mass. For SNII and SNIa, the ejected masses or chemical enrichment) are computed by adopting the yields from\noosley & Weaver ( 1995 ) and Iwamoto et al. ( 1999 ), respectively. F ollowing the superno va feedback model of N \u0301u \u0303 nez et al. ( 2017 ), he ejecta received by a gas particle is in one of the three superova remnant phases depending on the distance between the star article and the receiving gas particle: the momentum-conserving ree expansion (FE), the energy-conserving Sedov\u2013Taylor (ST), or he momentum-conserving sno wplo w (SP) phase. In the FE phase, he ejected mass is much greater than the mass swept out by he supernova remnant blast wave, and the ejecta expands at an lmost constant velocity and conserves momentum when impacting he surrounding medium. The supernova feedback is added to the as particle assuming a perfectly inelastic collision, resulting in a raction of the energy being transferred in kinetic form and the emaining energy in a thermal form. In the ST phase, the blast av e e xpands adiabatically, e xperiencing only ne gligible radiativ e osses, and it can be described by a self-similar solution in which 0 per cent of the ejected energy is kinetic energy, whereas the emaining 70 per cent is thermal energy. In the SP phase, the blast av e e xperiences significant energy loss due to radiativ e cooling, and hus the ejected energy decreases as a function of the radial distance. e refer the reader to N \u0301u \u0303 nez et al. ( 2017 ) for a detailed description nd implementation of this supernova feedback model. The AGB stellar feedback is implemented similarly to the aforeentioned supernova feedback in the FE phase, assuming that the omentum is conserved during the feedback process, and with he same time delay function as the SNIa feedback. The chemical nrichment for the AGB feedback is computed using the metalependent yields from Karakas ( 2010 ) and the AGB wind velocity is lso modelled using equation ( 2 ) but assuming a much lower velocity f v AGB = 25 km s \u22121 .\nBH M O D E L\n.1 Traditional single BH accretion (gadget)\nn the BHL accretion model (Hoyle & Lyttleton 1939 ; Bondi & Hoyle 944 ; Bondi 1952 ; Di Matteo et al. 2005 ; Springel et al. 2005 ), the ass accretion rate is computed as\n\u02d9 BHL = \u03b1 4 \u03c0G 2 M 2 BH \u03c1( c 2 s + v 2 rel )3 / 2 , (3) here M BH is the BH internal mass, and \u03c1, c s , and v rel are the as density, sound speed, and the magnitude of the relative velocity etween the BH and gas at the location of the BH, respectively. We se the same SPH approach as for gas particles to define the BH moothing length ( h BH ) and estimate the gas properties at the BH ocation using all SPH particles within h BH . The dimensionless boost actor, \u03b1, is introduced due to the limit of the numerical resolution n galaxy formation simulations. We adopt \u03b1 = 25 in this study.\nThe BH mass accretion rate is capped by the Eddington accretion ate, i.e.\n\u02d9 BH = min ( M\u0307 BHL , M\u0307 Edd ) , (4)\nNRAS 520, 4463\u20134489 (2023)\nhere the Eddington accretion rate is\n\u02d9 Edd = 4 \u03c0GM BH m p\nr \u03c3T c , (5)\nith m p , r , \u03c3 T , and c being the proton mass, the radiati ve ef ficiency, he Thomson cross section, and the speed of light, respectively. In his study, we adopt r = 0.1.\nIn the actual implementation, the internal mass of a BH particle is pdated at every time-step as\nBH ( t + t) = M BH ( t) + (1 \u2212 r ) M\u0307 BH t. (6) he factor of (1 \u2212 r ) is introduced here as an amount of energy E r = L r t has been radiated. Here, the radiated luminosity is r \u2261 r M\u0307 BH c 2 . The real dynamical mass of a BH particle, which is sed in the gravity calculations, tracks its internal mass closely in a robabilistic approach, i.e. at each time-step, the probability of a gas article being swallowed by the BH is\ni = w i M\u0307 BH t \u03c1 , (7)\nhere w i is the SPH kernel weight. For each gas particle, a uniform andom number x i \u2208 [0, 1] is generated, and if x i < p i , a fraction (1\nr ) of the mass and momentum of this gas particle is added to the H and the gas particle becomes a ghost particle thereafter. As the dynamical friction from stars, dark matter, and gas is not\nell resolved in traditional galaxy formation simulations, it is usually ssumed that this dynamical friction is able to efficiently keep the BH ear the galaxy centre. Specifically, at every time-step, we compute he gravitational potential and the particle-BH relative velocity v pBH or all types of particles within h BH , then reposition the BH to the osition of the particle with the minimum potential and with v pBH \u2264 .25 c s . When the distance between two BHs is smaller than any of heir smoothing lengths and their relative velocity satisfies v BH, rel 0.5 c s , these two BHs are merged instantaneously. Therefore, in he traditional galaxy formation simulations, the BH binary phase s not resolved. In this paper, we denote the traditional BH model utlined in this subsection as \u2018 gadget \u2019.\n.2 Ketju + single BH accretion ith the ketju integrator, we are able to resolve the BH dynamics in he binary phase, which further enables us to resolve the complex evoution of many BH mergers and their resulting GW signals in zoom-in alaxy formation simulations (Mannerkoski et al. 2021 , 2022 ). As n our previous zoom-in simulations of galaxy groups, the galaxies ere relatively gas-poor and the BH accretion was less important, e adopted the single BH accretion model described in Section 3.1 s an approximation, but with the following modifications: (i) The epositioning prescription is not used for BHs in ketju regularized egions as the non-softened gravity between star particles and BHs re calculated within the regularized regions, and the dynamical riction from stars is thus properly modelled. (ii) Two BHs are merged t a distance of six times the combined Schwarzschild radius, i.e. 2 G ( M BH, 1 + M BH, 2 )/ c 2 (where M BH, 1 and M BH, 2 are the masses of he primary and secondary black holes, respectively, and M BH, 1 \u2265 BH, 2 is assumed in this paper) as the ketju simulations include PN orrections up to order 3.5 for BH\u2013BH interactions and can resolve he evolution of a BH binary down to the separation regime where the ardening is dominated by GW emission. In this paper, this approach s denoted as \u2018 ketju + single accretion \u2019.\n3\nF a m m\no w w t t L 2 T e\nE\nw v r\nc C c b o t G n s i i B i\nl a\nFigure 2.

In this subsection, we introduce a BH binary accretion odel for the KETJU galaxy formation simulation code. We adopt a simple switch between the single and binary phase in ur model: when a BH is isolated (i.e. it does not form a bound binary ith any other BH), we use the \u2018ketju + single accretion\u2019 model; hen a BH forms a bound binary system with another BH, we use he binary accretion subgrid model which incorporates as an input he results from circumbinary disc simulations (e.g. Artymowicz & ubow 1996 ; Hayasaki et al. 2007 ; Farris et al. 2014 ; Duffell et al. 020 ; Mu \u0303 noz et al. 2020 ; see Lai & Mu \u0303 noz 2022 for a recent re vie w). wo nearby BHs are defined as a bound binary when their total orbital nergy satisfies 12 = 1 2 \u03bcv 2 12 \u2212 G M BH , 1 M BH , 2 r 12 < 0 , (8) here \u03bc = M BH, 1 M BH, 2 /( M BH, 1 + M BH, 2 ) is the reduced mass, and 12 and r 12 are the relative velocity and separation between two BHs, espectively.\nWhen two BHs form a bound binary system, the gas from the ircumnuclear disc forms a circumbinary disc centred on the binary oM position (see Fig. 1 for a schematic diagram). According to ircumbinary disc simulations, due to the tidal torques from the inary, the circumbinary disc develops a central cavity with a radius f roughly twice the binary semimajor axis where the gravitational orque from the binary balances the viscous torque from the disc. as streams from the circumbinary disc transport gas into the BH eighbourhood and mini-discs centred on each BH form. As the econdary BH is closer to the inner edge of the circumbinary disc, t can accrete gas from the circumbinary disc more readily and thus t preferentially has a higher accretion rate compared to the primary H. The consequence of this preferential accretion is that two BHs n a bound binary evolve towards equal-mass. As the scales of the circumbinary disc are not resolved in cosmoogical galaxy formation simulations, we incorporate this preferential ccretion of the secondary BH into our BH model in a subgrid\npproach. We first use the BHL accretion formalism to estimate the otal accretion rate for the whole binary system (or equi v alently the otal gas inflow rate into the circumbinary disc)\n\u02d9 BHL , CoM = \u03b1 4 \u03c0G 2 M 2 bin \u03c1CoM ( c 2 s , CoM + v 2 rel , CoM )3 / 2 , (9) here M bin = M BH, 1 + M BH, 2 is the total mass of the binary system, nd the gas density ( \u03c1CoM ), sound speed ( c s, CoM ), and the magnitude f relativ e v elocity between the gas and the binary\u2019s CoM velocity v rel, CoM ) are computed at the CoM position of the binary. Again \u03b1 = 5 is adopted in the binary accretion model. We also cap the total ccretion rate by the total Eddington accretion rate,\n\u02d9 bin \u2261 M\u0307 BH , 1 + M\u0307 BH , 2 = min ( M\u0307 BHL , CoM , M\u0307 Edd , bin ) , (10) here the total Eddington accretion rate is\n\u02d9 Edd , bin = 4 \u03c0GM bin m p\nr \u03c3T c . (11)\nTo further compute the actual mass accretion rate for each BH, we dopt the fitting equations from recent circumbinary disc simulations. n Fig. 2 , we compare the fitting formulae for the BH accretion ate ratio ( M\u0307 BH , 2 / M\u0307 BH , 1 ) as a function of the BH mass ratio ( q\nM BH, 2 / M BH, 1 ) from K elley et al. ( 2019 ), Duf fell et al. ( 2020 ), nd the recent work of Siwek et al. ( 2023 ). Note that the Kelley t al. ( 2019 ) formula is based on the data points from the Farris t al. ( 2014 ) simulations in the mass ratio range of 0.026 \u2264 q \u2264 , but it gives M\u0307 BH , 2 / M\u0307 BH , 1 < 1 for q 0 . 6, which contradicts the onclusion from circumbinary disc simulations. Duffell et al. ( 2020 ) rovide an updated fitting formula using simulations with mass ratios own to q \u223c 0.01. The Siwek et al. ( 2023 ) formula is based on imulations with BH mass ratio ranging from q = 0.1 to q = 1.\nDifferent fitting formulae tend to agree with each other better for arger mass ratios, i.e. q 0 . 1 (especially for recent simulations), he range which we also explore with our simulated BH binaries in his study, whereas they exhibit larger deviations for smaller q (which re less explored in circumbinary disc simulations). The difference mong different formulae might originate from the different numerial set-ups and methods used in these simulations (e.g. the viscosity\nMNRAS 520, 4463\u20134489 (2023)\nM\nm R\nfi w S\nW r r h c\n+ a B i\n3\nT t t e o\nE\ni u l f w p\nE\nw\nw C t f t v f 2 e t a i\nf\nE\ni u a e\nE\nT w\nE\nw f t d p t e t d d l g\np w\nE\nT b\nv\nI d o m a p p d\nf ( D t m l\ns r i T t e t w f \u223c o d A\nf B p t\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/520/3/4463/7031773 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nodel, sink prescription); see the discussions in e.g. Dittmann & yan ( 2021 ) and Siwek et al. ( 2023 ). In this study, we adopt the Duffell et al. ( 2020 ) formula which is tted from simulations with the broadest mass ratio range and agrees ell with other recent simulations such as Mu \u0303 noz et al. ( 2020 ) and iwek et al. ( 2023 ),\nM\u0307 BH , 2 M\u0307 BH , 1 = 1 0 . 1 + 0 . 9 q . (12)\nith equations ( 10 ) and ( 12 ), we can determine the mass accretion ate for each BH in the binary. Note that as we cap the total accretion ate by the total Eddington limit in our model, the secondary BH can a ve super -Eddington accretion (compared with the Eddington limit omputed by its own BH mass) if the BH mass ratio is small enough.\nWe denote the binary accretion model introduced abo v e as \u2018 ketju binary accretion \u2019 in this paper. Note that, as in the ketju + single ccretion model, here the repositioning prescription is not used for Hs with ketju integration and BHs are merged when their separation s less than six times the combined Schwarzschild radius.\n.4 BH feedback\no model the feedback from BHs, in this work, we implement wo approaches, i.e. thermal feedback and kinetic feedback. In the hermal feedback, following the previous literature (e.g. Di Matteo t al. 2005 ; Springel et al. 2005 ), we assume that some fraction f, th f the radiated luminosity,\n\u02d9 th = f, th r M\u0307 BH c 2 , (13)\ns coupled to the surrounding gas thermally and isotropically. We se f, th = 0.02 which reproduces the observed BH mass\u2013stellar veocity dispersion ( M BH \u2013\u03c3 ) relation. At each time-step, this thermal eedback energy is added to the internal energy of every gas particle ithin h BH according to the SPH kernel weights, i.e. the i -th gas article receives the amount of energy\nth ,i = w i m i E\u0307 th t \u03c1 , (14)\nhere m i is the gas particle mass. Moti v ated by observations of the AGN-driven galactic outflows ith velocities ranging from a few thousand km s \u22121 to \u223c0.1 c (see e.g. renshaw, Kraemer & George 2003 ; Laha et al. 2021 , for re vie ws), he kinetic feedback mechanism has been introduced into galaxy ormation simulations and has been shown to be more efficient han thermal feedback in regulating the BH gro wth, dri ving higher elocity gas outflows, and shock-heating gas compared to the thermal eedback model (e.g. Choi et al. 2012 , 2014 , 2015 ; Debuhr et al. 012 ; Barai et al. 2014 , 2016 ; Angl \u0301es-Alc \u0301azar et al. 2017 ; Costa t al. 2018 ; Costa, Pakmor & Springel 2020 ; Torrey et al. 2020 ). For he implementation of kinetic feedback in this study, we adopt an pproach which is similar to the kinetic mode of the AGN feedback n the Illustris TNG simulations (Weinberger et al. 2017 ).\nSimilar to the thermal feedback approach, we assume that some raction f, kin of the radiated luminosity,\n\u02d9 kin = f, kin r M\u0307 BH c 2 , (15)\ns coupled to the gas particles within the BH smoothing length. But nlike the continuous energy feedback in the thermal approach, we dd this kinetic feedback energy to the energy reservoir of the BH at ach time-step, i.e.\nkin , res ( t + t) = E kin , res ( t) + E\u0307 kin t. (16)\nNRAS 520, 4463\u20134489 (2023)\nhe energy stored in the reservoir is released to the surrounding gas hen it reaches the threshold,\nthr = 1 2 f thr M gas ( < h BH ) \u03c3 2 DM , (17)\nhere f thr is a free parameter that controls the strength of each kinetic eedback energy pulse, M gas ( < h BH ) is the enclosed gas mass within he BH smoothing length, and \u03c3 DM is the one-dimensional velocity ispersion computed from the 40 nearest neighbouring dark matter articles of the BH. By linking the feedback energy threshold to he local dark matter velocity dispersion, we ensure that the wind nergy does not significantly exceed the galaxy binding energy, and herefore we will not unbind a large amount of gas. The use of the ark matter velocity dispersion, instead of the gas or stellar velocity ispersions, provides a more numerically robust estimation of the ocal gravitational potential, as some galaxies might not have enough as/star particles.\nWhen releasing the energy in the reservoir, each surrounding gas article receives a fraction of the energy according to the SPH kernel eights, i.e.\nkin ,i = w i m i E kin , res \u03c1 . (18)\nhis amount of energy is coupled to the gas particle in a kinetic form y adding a kick velocity with the magnitude of kick ,i = \u221a\n2 E kin ,i m i . (19)\nn the single BH phase, following Choi et al. ( 2012 ), we set the irection of the kick velocity to be parallel (50 per cent probability) r antiparallel (50 per cent probability) to the direction of angular omentum r i \u00d7 v i , where r i and v i are the i th gas particle\u2019s position nd v elocity v ectors with respect to the BH. In the binary BH hase, the kick direction is parallel or antiparallel (again 50 per cent robability for each possibility) to the orbital angular momentum irection of the BH binary. Note that compared to many previous works of kinetic AGN eedback in which the kick velocity is fixed to a constant value usually in the range of \u223c10 3 \u201310 4 km s \u22121 , see e.g. Choi et al. 2012 ; ebuhr et al. 2012 ; Barai et al. 2014 ; Angl \u0301es-Alc \u0301azar et al. 2017 ), he kick velocity in our model varies for different gas particles, and ore physically, the o v erall kick v elocity magnitude depends on the ocal gravitational potential or equi v alently the galaxy virial mass. Our kinetic model has two free parameters: f, kin and f thr . As hown in Appendix A , the final BH mass of the galaxy merger emnant is more sensitive to the feedback efficiency parameter f, kin , .e. with a larger (smaller) f, kin , the final BH mass is lower (higher). herefore, we can use the observed M BH \u2013\u03c3 relation to calibrate he value for f, kin , which leads to f, kin = 0.008 for this study. The nergy reservoir threshold parameter f thr controls the magnitudes of he kick velocity in each feedback e vent. As sho wn in Appendix A , ith the fiducial value adopted for the simulations in this study thr = 20, the maximum kick velocities can reach up to values of 5000\u201310 000 km s \u22121 , which are the typical values of the observed utflow v elocity (e.g. Crensha w et al. 2003 ; Laha et al. 2021 ). The etails of the tests for our kinetic feedback model are summarized in ppendix A . Similar to some previous works which studied thermal and kinetic eedback models in simulations of isolated and merging galaxies (e.g. arai et al. 2014 , 2016 ), in this work, we use either pure thermal or ure kinetic feedback model. This approach allows us to compare he impact of different AGN feedback models on the results.\nNote.

( 2005 ) to generate single progenitor alaxies, then set up the orbit and orientation of the two progenitor alaxies. In all initial conditions, the gas and star particle mass is gas = m = 10 5 M , and the dark matter particle mass is m DM 1.6 \u00d7 10 6 M . The initial BH particle mass is set to the same alue as the other baryonic particles, mimicking the BH seeding n cosmological simulations and this places the progenitor galaxies elow the observed M BH \u2013\u03c3 relation. The cosmic time of the initial ondition is set to 10 . 7 Gyr . We generate two disc progenitor galaxies, D1 and D2, with ifferent total masses. Each disc progenitor consists of a dark matter alo with a Hernquist ( 1990 ) density profile, an exponential gas isc, an exponential stellar disc, a Hernquist stellar bulge, and a H. Except for the input virial velocity ( V vir ), which is used to etermine the total mass, all other input parameters are the same hen generating D1 and D2. Specifically, the input Navarro\u2013Frenk\u2013 hite (NFW, Navarro, Frenk & White 1996 ) profile-equi v alent halo oncentration is c = 9. The spin parameter is \u03bb = 0.033, the total disc i.e. gas + stellar) mass fraction is m d = 0.041, the gas mass fraction n the disc is f gas = 0.2, the fractional disc angular momentum is d = m d , and the vertical height of the stellar disc is set to be z d = .2 r d with r d being the disc scale length. We assume here that the as disc and the stellar disc have the same scale length. The stellar ulge mass fraction is m b = m d /3 = 0.01367, and the bulge scale ength is set to r b = 0.2 r d . Furthermore, we follow Lah \u0301en et al. 2018 ) to initialize the stellar ages and stellar/gaseous metallicities. o set up the stellar ages for bulge (disc) star particles, we assume n exponentially (linearly) decaying star formation rate (SFR). To nitialize the metal abundance of disc stars, bulge stars, and gas articles, we adopt a metallicity gradient of k = 0 . 0585 dex kpc \u22121 , a cale radius r s = 3 kpc , and the initial abundances at r s as given n table 2 of Lah \u0301en et al. ( 2018 ). The helium abundance is set ccording to the observed helium\u2013metallicity relation, Y = 2.1 Z 0.24, with Y and Z being the helium and total metal mass ractions, respectively (Jimenez et al. 2003 ; Casagrande et al. 007 ). For D1, the virial velocity is V vir = 200 km s \u22121 , and thus the\notal mass is M tot = 2 . 62 \u00d7 10 12 M and the virial radius 1 is R vir = 82 kpc . The disc scale length for D1 is r d = 4 . 32 kpc . The total ass of galaxy D2 is roughly twice the total mass of D1. For D2, the nput virial velocity is V vir = 250 km s \u22121 , resulting in a total mass f M tot = 5 . 12 \u00d7 10 12 M and a virial radius of R vir = 352 kpc .\nThe virial radius is defined as the radius within which the mean density is 00 times the critical density.\nl d s r\nhe D2 disc scale length is r d = 5 . 40 kpc . See Table 1 for more etailed information on these progenitors (e.g. the masses and article numbers for the different components). The reason that we av e relativ ely more massiv e disc galaxy progenitors here compared o previous works (e.g. Johansson et al. 2009a ; Johansson, Burkert & aab 2009b ) is to ensure that the BH seeds can grow to be massive nough before they enter the binary phase, fulfilling the BH-to-stellar article mass ratio requirements for the ketju integration (for details ee Section 4.2 ).\nThe progenitor galaxies described abo v e are further used to enerate the initial condition for the galaxy mergers. We assume hat the two galaxies approach each other on a parabolic orbit with n initial separation of d sep, ini = ( R vir, p + R vir, s )/2 and a pericentre istance of d peri, ini = r d, p + r d, s . Here, the subscripts of \u2018p\u2019 and s\u2019 represent \u2018primary\u2019 (more massive) galaxy and \u2018secondary\u2019 (less assi ve) galaxy, respecti vely. The assumption of parabolic orbit is oti v ated by the work of Khochfar & Burkert ( 2006 ), which shows hat half of the galaxy merger orbits are parabolic or very close to arabolic in cosmological simulations. In order to have a diverse merger sample, we set up initial condiions with different mass ratios and orbital geometries. Specifically, or the initial disc orientations, we adopt the geometries of G0, G5, nd G15 from Naab & Burkert ( 2003 ), of which the inclination of the isc with respect to the orbit plane i and the argument of pericentre for primary (p) and secondary (s) disc galaxies are as follows: G0: i p = \u03c9 p = i s = \u03c9 s = 0 \u25e6, G5: i p = \u2212109 \u25e6, \u03c9 p = \u221260 \u25e6, i s = 180 \u25e6, \u03c9 s = 0 \u25e6, G15: i p = \u2212109 \u25e6, \u03c9 p = 60 \u25e6, i s = 71 \u25e6, \u03c9 s = \u221230 \u25e6. The merger samples that we consider in this study are summarized n Table 2 . We name the galaxy mergers using the convention f \u2018progenitor galaxy types-galaxy mass ratio-orbit geometry\u2019, for xample, \u2018DD-21-G15\u2019 denotes the merger of two disc galaxies with n initial mass ratio 2: 1 and an initial G15 orbit.\n.2 Simulation details\nll simulations start at the cosmic time of t 0 = 10 . 7 Gyr and are volved for 3 Gyr , with the final snapshots reaching the current ge of the Universe (e.g. \u223c13 . 7 Gyr ). All BHs merge between 1.4 nd 2 Gyr after the start of the simulations. Each galaxy merger onfiguration consists of six runs: \u2018ketju + binary accretion\u2019, ketju + single accretion\u2019, and \u2018gadget\u2019, which differ in the BH ccretion model as described in Section 3 , and each of them has een run with both a pure thermal and a pure kinetic feedback odel. Note that a high enough BH-to-stellar particle mass ratio (e.g. at east a few hundred) is required to give sufficiently converged binary ynamics (Rantala et al. 2017 ). Therefore, in ketju runs, we only witch on the ketju integration for a BH when the mass of this BH eaches M BH \u2265 3 \u00d7 10 7 M , i.e. reaching a BH-to-stellar particle\nMNRAS 520, 4463\u20134489 (2023)\nM\nTable 2.

When two BHs enter the binary phase, typically his ratio can reach M BH /m 400. Before switching on the ketju ntegration, these runs are the same as the gadget runs. Furthermore, n the ketju runs, when two BHs have merged, there is no further BH erger in the remaining simulation time; therefore, to reduce compuational time, we switch off the ketju integration and move back to the adget mode but without repositioning the BH at each time-step. 2 To ummarize, the ketju runs have three stages, i.e. they are first run with he gadget mode (with BH repositioning) when the BH mass is below \u00d7 10 7 M , then we switch on the ketju integration until the two Hs merge, and finally mo v e back to the gadget mode (without BH epositioning). The softening lengths for dark matter, gas, stellar, and BH articles are DM = 100 pc , gas = 20 pc , = 5 pc , and BH = 5 pc , espectively. Note that and BH in our simulations are a factor f a few smaller than those in previous works which used the ame galaxy formation subgrid model and similar mass resolutions. or e xample, the stellar mass resolution and softening length are 0 5 M and 20 pc in Eisenreich et al. ( 2017 ), 1 . 3 \u00d7 10 5 M and 4 pc in N \u0301u \u0303 nez et al. ( 2017 ), and 3 \u00d7 10 5 M and 30 pc in Manerkoski et al. ( 2022 ). The moti v ation to adopt smaller and BH here are (i) to resolve the central stellar distribution down to maller radii, and (ii) to ensure that even for galaxy mergers with he strongest starburst during the merger (i.e. equal-mass mergers ith the G0 orbit), the number of star particles within the ketju egion radius ( r ketju = 3 ) is still computationally feasible ( 10 4 articles) with the current KETJU code. As discussed in Ludlow et al. 2020 ), based on the EAGLE galaxy formation model (Schaye et al. 015 ), the optimal/calibrated parameters for the subgrid model in alaxy formation simulations might depend on the adopted softening engths. Ho we ver, as detailed in Section 5 , our simulations reproduce ery well the observed scaling relations, thus suggesting that the oftening lengths adopted in our simulations are still within a hysically moti v ated range for our adopted galaxy formation subgrid odel. In all simulations, we set the gadget integrator error tolerance arameter to \u03b7 = 0.02, and the tree force accuracy parameter to force = 0.005. The ketju integrator Gragg\u2013Bulirsch\u2013Stoer (GBS, ragg 1965 ; Bulirsch & Stoer 1966 ) accuracy tolerance parameter\ns set to \u03b7GBS = 10 \u22128 . We save snapshots every 50 Myr.\nNRAS 520, 4463\u20134489 (2023)\nWhen the simulations return back to the gadget mode, repositioning is o longer used because the merged BH has now become massive enough ompared to the star particles (e.g. M BH /m 1000). Note that a similar pproach has been adopted in the EAGLE simulation, i.e. only BHs with asses less than 100 m gas are repositioned to the minimum of the halo ravitational potential (Schaye et al. 2015 ).\na b a t t r e F\nRESULTS\n.1 BH growth history\ne start by comparing the BH growth history in merger runs with ifferent BH accretion models. In Fig. 3 , we use the DD-11-G15 run ith thermal feedback as an example to illustrate the behaviour of he BH accretion in the gadget (blue lines), ketju + single accretion orange lines), and ketju + binary accretion (green lines) models.\nIn the left panels, we show the time-evolution of the BH separation, he total SFR in the galaxies, the total BH accretion rate, and the otal BH mass in the different runs. Two BHs start from an initial eparation of 282 kpc , and evolv e e xactly in the same way in all hree runs until t \u223c 1.5 Gyr when the mass of a BH in the ketju runs ncreases to the threshold of 3 \u00d7 10 7 M (marked by the vertical olid lines). Once a BH in a ketju run reaches this mass threshold, it s evolved by the ketju integrator, which computes the non-softened ravity between the BH and star particles in the regularized region. After two pericentre passages, the two BHs rapidly sink to the very entre of the galaxy remnant due to dynamical friction. At the same ime, the tidal response drives the gas to the centre, and a starburst s triggered, with the total SFR increasing to \u223c60 M yr \u22121 . The BH ccretion rates also increase significantly, approaching \u223c1 M yr \u22121 . he two BHs merge at t \u223c 1 . 65 Gyr in the gadget run (marked by he blue filled circle) with a final separation of \u223c10 pc , while they ecome a bound binary roughly at the same time (marked by the ertical dashed lines) in the ketju runs. Once the BHs enter the inary phase in the ketju runs, due to the different BH accretion odels, we start to observe differences in the BH evolution between he ketju + single accretion and ketju + binary accretion runs. In he ketju runs, the BH binary subsequently shrinks by interacting ith stars and ejecting them in three-body slingshots until the GW mission takes o v er. BHs in the ketju runs merge roughly \u223c200 Myr fter they become a bound binary at the final separation of \u223c10 \u22123 pc . ompared to the gadget run, the KETJU code enables us to resolve the hree-stage BH merging process, which is not resolved in traditional alaxy formation simulations.\nOverall, all three runs show relatively similar BH growth and lobal star formation histories as they adopt similar BHL accretion, hermal AGN feedback, and subgrid models. Ho we ver, we do notice hat during the BH binary phase, the ketju + binary accretion nd ketju + single accretion runs exhibit different BH accretion ehaviours, i.e. the total BH accretion rate in the ketju + single ccretion run becomes increasingly lower and when the BHs merge here is an abrupt sharp increase in the accretion rate. In contrast, he BH accretion rate is smoother in the ketju + binary accretion un. To see this more clearly, we zoom in on the BH accretion volution during the binary phase and plot it in the right panels of ig. 3 .\nFigure 3. The BH growth history in the DD-11-G15 run with thermal feedback. Left-hand panel: from top to bottom, the time-evolution of the BH separation, the total SFR, the total BH accretion rate, and the total BH mass from the gadget (blue), ketju + single accretion (orange), and ketju + binary accretion (green) runs are plotted. The vertical solid lines mark the onset of the ketju integration for ketju runs, while the vertical dashed lines denote the formation of a bound BH binary in the ketju runs. The filled circles mark the BH merger events. Note that the total SFR and the total BH accretion rate are averaged over 10 Myr. Right-hand panel: The evolution of the BH mass, the BH mass ratio, the BH accretion rate, the gas density, the sound speed, and the BH-gas relative velocity (from top to bottom) for each BH during the BH binary phase in the ketju runs.

The grey vertical dashed lines mark the formation of a bound BH binary, whereas the orange/green vertical dotted lines mark the merging of the BHs in the ketju + single accretion/ketju + binary accretion run. Note that the BH accretion rate, the gas density, the sound speed, and the BH-gas relative velocity are averaged over 2 Myr.\nr f a t t m a t\nb r p b r a p t a\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/520/3/4463/7031773 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nIn the right panels, we plot the mass, the mass ratio, the accretion ate, the gas density, the sound speed, and the gas-BH relative velocity or each BH in both the ketju + single accretion and ketju + binary ccretion runs. Before the BHs enter the binary phase (marked by he vertical dashed lines), these two runs are exactly the same, and he BH mass ratio is decreasing to \u223c0.8 (as the primary BH accretes\nore gas according to the BHL formula). After the BHs become bound binary, in the ketju + binary accretion run we see that he secondary BH has a higher gas accretion rate during the whole\ninary phase, and therefore the evolutionary trend of the BH mass atio reverses and approaches instead unity. This is caused by the referential accretion of the secondary BH in our newly introduced inary accretion model. In contrast, in the ketju + single accretion un, the BHL formula is used for each BH, and the primary BH l w ays has a higher accretion rate since the BH accretion rate is roportional to M 2 BH . Just before the two BHs merge (marked by he vertical dotted lines), the BH mass ratio in the ketju + binary ccretion run is \u223c0.9, while in the ketju + single accretion run it is\nMNRAS 520, 4463\u20134489 (2023)\nM\nFigure 4.

This clearly demonstrates that the circumbinary disc subgrid odel tends to equalize the masses of the BHs in a binary system. Apart from the preferential accretion, we can observe another\nignificant difference between the two ketju runs. As the BHs ecome tightly bound in the binary phase, their inspiral velocities eep increasing. In the ketju + single accretion run, the gas-BH elativ e v elocity is still computed using the v elocity of each BH, nd as a result v rel increases from a few hundred to \u223c10 4 km s \u22121 . ote also that v rel is larger for the secondary BH. This extremely igh relativ e v elocity in the denominator of the BHL formula ignificantly suppresses the BH accretion rate and thus the AGN eedback strength, and as a result, gas accumulates in the vicinity f the BH. When the two BHs merge, v rel abruptly drops from 10 4 to \u223c10 2 km s \u22121 , and as a consequence the BH accretion rate omputed from the BHL formula jumps by roughly three orders of agnitude (note that the plotted jumps in Fig. 3 are less significant s the accretion rates have been smoothed o v er 10 and 2 Myr , in\nNRAS 520, 4463\u20134489 (2023)\nhe left and right panels, respectively). The resulting strong AGN eedback subsequently pushes the accumulated gas away, leading to tep function-like behaviours in many quantities plotted in the right anels. This flaw of the ketju + single accretion model originates rom the fact that although the BH binary dynamics is resolved by the etju integrator, the gas resolution is still limited in current galacticcale galaxy formation simulations. In contrast, in the ketju + binary ccretion run, as the gas-BH relative velocity is computed using the oM velocity of the binary when estimating the total accretion rate f the binary system, the plotted quantities evolve more smoothly. In Fig. 4 , we plot the BH growth history of the DD-11-G15 erger with pure kinetic AGN feedback. Compared to the thermal eedback run, we notice that the BH accretion in the kinetic run ho ws more v ariability, the gas density at the location of the BH s lower, and the SFR is also lower (i.e. the peaked total SFR here s \u223c30 M yr \u22121 compared to \u223c60 M yr \u22121 in the thermal case), s the kinetic feedback is more ef fecti v e in remo ving gas from the\nc p 2 i m f o f t t i t t t\na p a t a t c a k o o t\n5\nI r n\nFigure 6. The galaxy size\u2013stellar mass relation for the galaxy merger remnants in ketju + binary accretion runs. The filled circles (diamonds) with y -errors show the galaxy remnants of different mergers in the thermal (kinetic) feedback runs. Similar to Fig. 5 , the error of the projected stellar halfmass radius in each simulation is computed from 50 random projections. The observed relations for early-type galaxies from Shen et al. ( 2003 ), Newman et al. ( 2012 ), and van der Wel et al. ( 2014 ) are o v erplotted for comparison. Note that the redshifts of the galaxies in Shen et al. ( 2003 ) are z 0 . 3. The van der Wel et al. ( 2014 ) relation plotted here is the one of the z = 0.25 bin, and the plotted Newman et al. ( 2012 ) relation is the one fitted from z = 0.06 SDSS early-type galaxies (see their table 1).\ng r\ni o p e r a f T ( t w s t o f c B t w t e o k f\nr t H s\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/520/3/4463/7031773 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nentral region and thus reducing the star formation, in agreement with revious studies (e.g. Choi et al. 2012 , 2014 , 2015 ; Barai et al. 2014 , 016 ). After the BHs form a binary in the ketju runs, the differences n the evolution of the SFR, the BH accretion rate, and the BH ass among the three runs become larger compared to the thermal eedback case, which should originate from the higher stochasticity f the pulsed kinetic feedback compared to the continuous thermal eedback. Nev ertheless, o v erall the behaviour of the BH accretion in he kinetic feedback runs is qualitatively similar to accretion in the hermal feedback, suggesting that our binary accretion model works n both the thermal and kinetic feedback mechanisms. Finally, note hat although here we only use the DD-11-G15 merger as an example o detail the BH growth history, similar results can also be found for he other mergers. In this subsection, we have demonstrated that if the BHL single ccretion model is directly applied to BHs in the resolved binary hase (i.e. the ketju + single accretion model), then the total BH ccretion rate is suppressed due to the high BH inspiral velocity and he unresolved small-scale gas velocity. There are also unphysical brupt jumps in the accretion-related quantities, and the evolution of he BH mass ratio is also in disagreement with the predictions from ircumbinary disc simulations. Given these flaws in the ketju + single ccretion model, in the following subsections, we will focus on the etju + binary accretion runs which model the accretion behaviour f binary BHs in a more physically reasonable approach. Unless therwise specified, the ketju runs in the remaining subsections refer o the ketju + binary accretion runs.\n.2 Galaxy scaling relations\nn this subsection, we compute the scaling relations for the galaxy emnants in all ketju + binary accretion runs and check if the ewly introduced BH model in combination with the other included\nalaxy formation subgrid models can reproduce the observed scaling elations.\nWe first look at the M BH \u2013\u03c3 relation. To compute the stellar velocty dispersion, we consider all star particles within an aperture radius f 30 kpc centred on the BH in the final snapshot ( t = 3 Gyr ), and roject them along 50 random line-of-sight (LOS) directions. Along ach LOS direction, we compute the projected stellar half-mass adius, R e , and then calculate the dispersion of the LOS velocities of ll star particles within R e . The final \u03c3 and its uncertainty are taken rom the mean and standard deviation of all 50 random projections. he simulated M BH \u2013\u03c3 relation from all galaxy merger remnants distinguished by colours) in both the thermal (filled circles) and he kinetic (diamonds) feedback runs is plotted in Fig. 5 , in which e o v erplot the observ ed relations from the literature. Although we tart with galaxies containing BH seeds which are located below he observed M BH \u2013\u03c3 relation, the final galaxy remnants mo v e n to the observed relation, suggesting that our BH accretion and eedback (both thermal and kinetic) models successfully model the o-evolution of BHs and their host galaxies. We note that the final Hs in our kinetic feedback runs are slightly more massive than hose in the thermal feedback runs as our kinetic feedback model as calibrated with the van den Bosch ( 2016 ) relation, while the hermal feedback model was originally calibrated using the Tremaine t al. ( 2002 ) relation. Compared to the thermal feedback runs, the v erall lower \u03c3 in the kinetic feedback runs reflect the fact that the inetic feedback mechanism is more ef fecti ve in suppressing the star ormation in the centres of the merger remnants.\nIn Fig. 6 , we compare the simulated galaxy size\u2013stellar mass elation with the observed relations for early-type galaxies from he SDSS (Shen et al. 2003 ; Newman et al. 2012 ) and the 3DST + CANDELS (van der Wel et al. 2014 ) data. The galaxy ize and its uncertainty are computed from the mean and standard\nMNRAS 520, 4463\u20134489 (2023)\nM\nFigure 7. The X-ray luminosity from hot and diffuse gas as a function of stellar mass for the galaxy merger remnants in the ketju + binary accretion runs. The filled circles (diamonds) with y -errors are from simulations with thermal (kinetic) feedback models. The inset panel shows a zoom of the clustered simulation data points (except the kinetic feedback runs of DD11-G0 and DD-11-G5). Note that the error bars of some simulation data points cannot be seen if they are smaller than the sizes of those markers. The observations of the MASSIVE and ATLAS3D early-type galaxies (Goulding et al. 2016 ) are plotted with open triangles and circles, respectively. Note that the stellar masses for the MASSIVE and ATLAS3D galaxies are estimated from their K -band magnitudes, M K , which are retrieved from Ma et al. ( 2014 ) and Cappellari et al. ( 2011 ), respectively, according to the relation of log 10 M = 10.58 \u2212 0.44( M K + 23).

Overall, the sizes of our alaxy remnants are comparable to those of the observed earlyype galaxies, but we can also notice that they are systematically ome what belo w the best-fitting observed relations. This can be xplained by the fact that the galaxy remnants in these idealized erger simulations only experience one major merger, but in the real niv erse, galaxies e xperience additional subsequent minor mergers uring their evolution, which can further increase their sizes (e.g. aab, Johansson & Ostriker 2009 ; Johansson, Naab & Ostriker 012 ). We also compute the X-ray luminosity from hot and diffuse gas or our galaxy remnants and compare the results with observed earlyype galaxies from the MASSIVE and ATLAS3D surv e ys (Goulding t al. 2016 ) in Fig. 7 . To estimate the X-ray luminosity from hot gas roduced by bremsstrahlung and metal-line cooling, we follow the ethod outlined in Eisenreich et al. ( 2017 ). Using the APEC model version 3.0.9) (Smith et al. 2001 ) implemented in PYATOMDB Foster & Heuer 2020 ), we first calculate the X-ray luminosity L X ( T , .4 Z ) and the metallicity gradient (d L X /d Z )( T ) in the soft energy ange of 0.3\u20135 keV for a plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium ith a temperature T and metallicity Z = 0.4 Z for a range of emperatures between 0.01 and 85 keV . The solar metal abundance s adopted from Anders & Grevesse ( 1989 ). With this pre-calculated able, for a gas particle with temperature T i and metallicity Z i from he simulation, the X-ray luminosity can be estimated as\nX ,i = N [ L X ( T \u2032 i , 0 . 4 Z ) + ( Z i \u2212 0 . 4 Z )\nd L X d Z \u2223\u2223\u2223 T \u2032\ni\n] , (20)\nhere T \u2032 i is the tabulated temperature which is closest to T i , and he normalization factor N depends on the mass, mass density, and\nNRAS 520, 4463\u20134489 (2023)\nlectron density of the gas particle. The total X-ray luminosity of galaxy remnant is computed by summing o v er all considered gas articles. We only consider gas particles for which the distance from he BH are within the 3D stellar half-mass radius ( R 1/2 ). We further xclude gas particles with densities higher than the star formation ensity threshold (2 . 2 \u00d7 10 \u221224 g cm \u22123 ), as such star-forming dense as is likely to be obscured by the dust. Note that the gas X-ray uminosity of a galaxy fluctuates o v er time, and in order to have a\nore robust estimation, we have computed the X-ray luminosities of he last 10 snapshots (corresponding to the simulation time between .5 and 3 Gyr ) for each merger remnant, and plot their mean and tandard deviation in Fig. 7 .\nFrom Fig. 7 , we find that the o v erall hot gas X-ray luminosities of ur galaxy remnants agree well with observations. Compared to the hermal feedback runs, the X-ray luminosities in kinetic feedback uns tend to have larger error bars, reflecting the higher stochasticity f the pulsed kinetic feedback model. We also notice that the mergers f DD-11-G0 and DD-11-G5 with kinetic feedback tend to predict ower X-ray luminosity as these two galaxy mergers (especially D-11-G0) have higher BH accretion rates and thus stronger AGN eedback during the merger, and the kinetic feedback have removed ore gas from the centre for these two mergers thus lowering the as X-ray luminosity significantly. This is in agreement with Choi t al. ( 2014 ) which suggests that kinetic AGN feedback can produce ower gas X-ray luminosity compared to thermal AGN feedback.\nTo summarize, we have presented three scaling relations that are elated to the BHs, the stellar component, and the gas component rom our simulations, and have shown that the newly introduced H model in combination with the subgrid models adopted in our imulations are able to reproduce the observations reasonably well.\n.3 BH binary orbital evolution\nn Fig. 8 , we plot the PN corrected orbital parameters Memmesheimer, Gopakumar & Sch \u0308afer 2004 ; Mannerkoski et al. 019 ), the semimajor axis a and the eccentricity e , for the BH binaries n different galaxy mergers (distinguished by colours) with both hermal (solid) and kinetic (dashed) feedback models. We also give he BH binary merger time-scales, which are measured from when he two BHs become a stably bound binary to when the two BHs erge. For both equal-mass and unequal-mass mergers, the BHs in the\n0 run form a bound binary first, then the G5 run, and only later he G15 run, reflecting that the BHs in the G0 run experience the trongest dynamical friction as a result of the strongest star formation n the galaxy centre (see e.g. Johansson et al. 2009a ), in the G5 and 15 runs the merger induced starbursts are systematically weaker. lso, compared to equal-mass mergers, the BHs in the unequal-mass ergers with the same galaxy orbital geometry experience weaker ynamical friction, in agreement with previous work (e.g. Capelo t al. 2015 ), and thus tend to form a binary later. For the same galaxy erger, the BHs in the kinetic feedback runs form binaries later than heir counterparts in the thermal feedback runs, which is a result of he lower SFRs in the kinetic feedback runs, which results in weaker ynamical friction. All BH binaries in our simulations merge within a few hundred yr, and there is no final parsec problem (Begelman et al. 1980 ; ilosavljevi \u0301c & Merritt 2003 ). The merger time-scales in our imulations are in the range \u223c10\u2013400 Myr. The DD-11-G0 run with hermal feedback has a particularly short merger time-scale of only\n7 Myr . This equal-mass, co-planar, and prograde galaxy merger as the strongest tidal torque which drives a very high fraction of\nFigure 8.

Note that in contrast to the g as-free g alaxy merger imulations in which the merger time-scales of BH binaries with ow eccentricities usually reach several Gyr (e.g. Khan et al. 2012a ; antala et al. 2017 ), the low-eccentricity BH binaries in our gas-rich alaxy mergers merge rapidly. For example, both the thermal and inetic feedback runs of DD-11-G5 and the thermal feedback run f DD-11-G15 have relatively low eccentricities of \u223c0.1\u20130.3, but heir merger time-scales are just \u223c100 to \u223c200 Myr. We also notice hat o v erall the BH binary merger time-scales in the kinetic feedback uns (i.e. from \u223c100 to \u223c400 Myr) are longer than those in thermal eedback runs (i.e. from \u223c10 to \u223c200 Myr).\nAll the aforementioned results point to an explanation that in as-rich disc galaxy mergers, the gas is driven to the galaxy centre nd triggers the formation of new stars which replenish the loss\none of the BH binary; these stars interact with the BHs, and ead to an o v erall shorter merger time-scales compared to gas-free alaxy mergers. Compared to the thermal feedback case, the kinetic eedback is more ef fecti ve in suppressing star formation during alaxy merging. Thus, for comparable binary eccentricities, the BH inary merger time-scales in the kinetic feedback runs tend to be onger.\n.4 Star ejections by the BH binary\nith the ketju integrator, we are able to resolve accurately the lose dynamical interactions between star particles and the BH inary, which cannot be resolved in traditional galaxy formation imulations (e.g. the gadget runs). Note that while gravitational lingshot ejections have been studied extensively in gas-free mergers\nMNRAS 520, 4463\u20134489 (2023)\nM\n( g a y m a q\ne s b o w \u2018 c o t c b t \u2018 o r o b m f e e E\nE s\ns t t p w C c N h b g b p\nf e w I h w\n3\nr h 4\nm t c a\no s g p\ns w h p f c g t s B i\no a c p p e\nt w t b S \u2018 b s h N s M a g\nm t c o b w s M 2 t q B M c\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/520/3/4463/7031773 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 20\ne.g. Milosavljevi \u0301c & Merritt 2001 ; Merritt 2006 ), here by including as ph ysics and other g alaxy formation processes, we will be able to ddress further related questions, such as: Are the ejected stars mostly oung or old? Does the ejected stellar mass still correlate with the BH ass in hydrodynamic simulations, and do AGN feedback models ffect the stellar ejections? In this subsection, we try to answer these uestions with our gas-rich galaxy merger simulations. To study the slingshot kicks on star particles, we follow Frigo t al. ( 2021 ) and compute the change of the specific energy of tar particles between the snapshot before the formation of a BH inary (the \u2018before\u2019 snapshot) and the snapshot after the merger f BHs (the \u2018after\u2019 snapshot), E / E \u2261 ( E after \u2212 E before )/ E before , ith E before and E after being the specific energy of a particle in the before\u2019 and the \u2018after\u2019 snapshots, respectively. Compared to the ollisionless galaxy merger simulations used in Frigo et al. ( 2021 ), ur simulations contain gas and the related baryonic processes, and herefore additional effects need to be considered carefully when omputing the energy change. Specifically: (i) a gas particle can e converted into a star particle in our simulations, and therefore he progenitor in the \u2018before\u2019 snapshot of a star particle in the after\u2019 snapshot can be either a gas or a star particle; (ii) as the v ermassiv e gas particles are split into two particles to keep the mass esolution more uniform, we have to record the splitting history in ur simulations so that we can trace the progenitors of any given aryonic (gas or star) particle in previous snapshots; (iii) as the asses of baryonic particles can change o v er time due to stellar eedback and metal diffusion, instead of computing the change of nergy, here we compute the change of specific energy. The specific nergy of a baryonic particle is computed as E i = \u02dc E i /m p ,i , where \u02dc i is the total energy and m p, i is the particle mass. For a gas particle, \u02dc i is the sum of kinetic, potential, and internal energy, while for a tar particle, \u02dc E i is the sum of kinetic and potential energies. The distributions of E / E for different galaxy merger runs are hown in Fig. 9 . To obtain this figure, we consider for each run all he star particles in the \u2018after\u2019 snapshot, compute their E after , and race back their progenitor particles (which can be either gas or star articles) in the \u2018before\u2019 snapshot. For all bound 3 progenitor particles hich are within twice the stellar half-mass radius (centred on the oM position of the BH binary 4 ), we compute their E before , then ompute the relative energy change E / E , and plot the distribution. ote that as E before is ne gativ e, E / E > 0 means that the particle as become more bound, while E / E < 0 means that it has ecome less bound or even unbound. To study the impact of the as progenitor particles, we plot separately the histograms for all aryonic progenitor particles (open) and for only star progenitor articles (filled). For all runs, the histograms at E / E > 0 are relatively similar or the gadget and ketju runs. The particles with very positive nergy change (e.g. E/E 1) are mostly gas progenitor particles hich have cooled down, formed stars, and become more bound. n contrast, in the ne gativ e energy change range, the ketju runs ave significant tails of particles extending to very negative values hich have interacted with the BH binary and become less bound\nNRAS 520, 4463\u20134489 (2023)\nThe fraction of unbound progenitor particles (i.e. gas particles which have ecently received energy from feedback processes) within twice the stellar alf-mass radius is negligible ( 10 \u22125 ) for all runs. The centre of a merging galaxy is difficult to define while it is still in the erging process. Here, we have tried three definitions for the galaxy centre: he CoM of the BH binary, the position of either BH, and the stellar centre omputed with the shrinking sphere method (Power et al. 2003 ). The results re similar for all of the methods.\na s\no r i t r t\n24\nr even unbound. On the other hand, the gadget runs only have a mall number of particles with E / E < \u22121, and they are usually as progenitor particles which have received energy from feedback rocesses in the later evolution. In the ne gativ e energy change range, the ketju histograms start to ignificantly differ from the gadget ones at E/E \u22120 . 5. Thus, e use E / E < \u22120.5 to approximately define the particles which av e receiv ed strong kicks from the BH binary. These particles are ushed to larger radii (for \u22121 E/E < \u22120 . 5) or even escape rom the galaxy (for E / E < \u22121), and thus they can affect the entral dynamics of the galaxy. Note that as we can see from the adget histograms, the baryonic feedback processes can also lead o ne gativ e energy changes for some particles, but as the number of uch particles is very low compared to the star particles kicked by the H binary in the ketju histograms, they do not affect our estimation n any significant way. The total mass of the star particles with E / E < \u22120.5, i.e. the mass f ejected stars ( M ej ), and the mass of the BH after merging ( M BH ) re summarized in Table 3 , and their relation is shown in Fig. 10 . We an see that for both thermal and kinetic feedback runs, there is a ositive correlation between M ej and M BH , and a linear fit to all data oints in Fig. 10 gives M ej = 0.44 M BH , i.e. the mass of the strongly jected stars is roughly half of the total BH mass.\nWe notice that in Fig. 10 , the BHs in the kinetic feedback runs end to be more massive than the BHs in the thermal feedback runs, hich is due to two factors. First, as we have discussed in Fig. 5 , he final BH masses in our calibrated kinetic feedback model tend to e slightly more massive than those in the thermal feedback model. econd, note that the BH masses in Fig. 10 are measured from the after\u2019 snapshots. Compared to the thermal feedback runs, the BH inaries in the kinetic feedback runs tend to have longer merger timecales, and as a result, they have already accreted more mass and ave merged to become more massive BHs in the \u2018after\u2019 snapshots. ote that we also fitted the linear relation between M ej and M BH eparately for the thermal and kinetic feedback runs, and the results, ej = 0.55 M BH and M ej = 0.41 M BH , respectively, are similar to the forementioned combined fit, suggesting that the combined fit is a ood representation of the o v erall correlation. As a comparison, previous studies have investigated the stellar ass deficit in bright elliptical galaxies, M def , which is defined as he difference in the integrated mass between the assumed initial uspy profile and the observed/simulated final cored profile. From bservational data and g as-free g alaxy merger simulations, it has een found that M def correlates with the BH mass as M def = fM BH ith the factor f varying from \u223c0.5 to \u223c10, and there have been uggestions that f is proportional to the number of mergers (e.g. ilosavljevi \u0301c & Merritt 2001 ; Milosavljevi \u0301c et al. 2002 ; Graham 004 ; Merritt 2006 ; Rantala et al. 2019 ; Nasim et al. 2021 ). Note hat we adopt here a definition that is different from these studies to uantify the mass of the stars which have strongly interacted with a H binary, but interestingly we see a correlation between M ej and BH similar to the one between M def and M BH in the single merger ase (i.e. f = 0.5, Merritt 2006 ). This similarity suggests that our dopted criterion (i.e. E / E < \u22120.5) for the definition of ejected tellar mass is reasonable.\nIn Fig. 11 , we show the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) f the formation time of the strongly ejected stars in the different uns. Star particles with ne gativ e formation times are already present n the initial condition and their formation times are generated using he methods described in Section 4.1 . For all thermal feedback uns, there are sharp increases of CDFs at roughly 200 Myr prior o the onset of the BH binary phase, indicating that the majority\nFigure 9.

These new tars form from the gas driven to the galaxy centre by the tidal orques during the galaxy mergers. In the DD-11-G0 run, which as the strongest starburst, nearly 80 per cent of the ejected stars re formed after t = 1 . 2 Gyr (i.e. \u223c200 Myr prior to the formation f the bound BH binary).

At radii of r r ketju = 3 , in both the thermal and kinetic eedback simulations, the stellar density profiles in the ketju runs are uspier than in the gadget runs. As a quantitative measurement, we ompute the summed enclosed stellar mass within the ketju region adius r ketju centred on both BHs and show the mass ratio between the etju and gadget runs in the top-right corner of each panel in Fig. 12 . e can see that this ratio tends to be abo v e one, and in some runs t can even reach a factor of a few. This difference in the very inner\nensity profile can be explained by the fact that in the ketju runs, on-softened gravity is considered between BHs and stars within the e gularized re gion while in the gadget runs, softened gravity is used ithin the distance of 2.8 for all interactions, leading to artificially ore flattened profiles.

This reflects the effects of the jection of stars by the BH binary via the slingshot interaction. This ffect is more significant in the kinetic feedback runs because their jected stellar masses are higher (see Fig. 10 ) and their central stellar ensities are lower compared to their counterparts in the thermal eedback runs. At the top-right corner of each panel, we again give the etju-to-gadget ratio of the enclosed stellar mass within 3 . Note that he ratios of some merger remnants are greater than 1 (e.g. thermal D-21-G0 and DD-21-G5, kinetic DD-11-G15); ho we ver, compared\nNRAS 520, 4463\u20134489 (2023)\no the corresponding ratios in the \u2018before\u2019 snapshots (Fig. 12 ), they ave decreased, suggesting that the star ejection in the ketju run is ndeed lowering the central stellar densities.\nHo we ver, we can clearly notice one outlier, the DD-11-G5 kinetic eedback simulation, which seems to contradict the conclusions bo v e. F or this simulation, after the two BHs merge, the central tellar density profile in the ketju run is significantly higher than hat in the gadget run, even though the stellar density profiles in hese two runs are very similar in the \u2018before\u2019 snapshots. After an xamination of the star formation histories in these two runs, we nd that the central density bump in the ketju run originates from he formation of an ultra-compact stellar clump, with a stellar mass f \u223c5 \u00d7 10 8 M and a stellar half-mass radius of \u223c20 pc.

In the ketju run, the nitially formed stellar clumps are more compact and clustered, and n the subsequent evolution, the small differences are amplified in runaway manner as the clumps merge to form an ultra-compact lump which is compact enough that it survives the tidal interactions nd finally merges into the centre of the galaxy merger remnant, thus oosting significantly the central density profile and o v ershadowing he effect of star ejection.\nIn contrast, in the gadget run these initially formed stellar clumps n the tidal arm are less compact and less clustered. In their later volution they remain as small and separate clumps, and are finally idally disrupted when they merge into the galaxy remnant centre.\ne have performed a test gadget run starting with the ketju \u2018before\u2019 napshot at t = 1.55 Gyr which contains the ultra-compact clump oving along the tidal arm, and found that at t = 1.80 Gyr, the stellar ensity profile in this test gadget run is indeed higher than the ketju ne, which is similar to the other galaxy mergers discussed before. ee Appendix B for more details. In order to quantify if a ketju galaxy merger remnant has a cored ensity profile, we compute the surface density profile ( r ) in the after\u2019 snapshot for each ketju + binary accretion run. We project he star particles along 50 random viewing directions, compute ( r ) n the projected radius range of [0.01, 60] kpc for each viewing irection, stack ( r ) o v er all viewing directions, and fit the stacked rofile using the six-parameter core-S \u0301ersic profile (Graham et al. 003 ; Trujillo et al. 2004 )\n( r) = \u2032 [ 1 + ( r b\nr\n)\u03b1\u2032 ]\u03b3 /\u03b1\u2032 exp \u23a1 \u23a3 \u2212b ( r \u03b1\n\u2032 + r \u03b1\u2032 b r \u03b1\n\u2032 e ) 1 / ( \u03b1\u2032 n ) \u23a4 \u23a6 , (21) here \u2032 is the normalization surface density, r b is the break radius\neparating the inner power law with a logarithmic slope \u03b3 and the uter S \u0301ersic function with an index n and an ef fecti ve radius r e , \u03b1 \u2032 is a arameter controlling the sharpness of the break, and b is defined by equiring that r e becomes the radius enclosing half of the total mass f the profile. The best-fitting parameters for the different runs are ummarized in Table 3 . Note that the fitted profiles with very small b (i.e. less than the lower limit of the fitting radius range, 0.01 kpc) re essentially S \u0301ersic profiles (S \u0301ersic 1963 ), see e.g. the thermal runs f DD-11-G5 and DD-11-G15. In the thermal feedback runs, the inner logarithmic slopes are 1, suggesting that all galaxy remnants are cuspy galaxies. In he kinetic feedback runs, galaxy remnants tend to have smaller \u03b3 . specially, the DD-11-G15, DD-21-G0, and DD-21-G15 remnants, or which the break radii and inner slopes are marked with dagger ymbols ( \u2020 ) in Table 3 , have \u03b3 < 0.2, suggesting that these remnants ave core-like stellar density distributions with core radii (i.e. the reak radii) ranging from \u223c50 to \u223c100 pc. In Table 3 , we also rovide the central enclosed stellar masses within 100 pc in the alaxy remnants, M 100 pc , and the ratios between the ejected stellar ass and this central stellar mass. In the thermal feedback runs, the jected stellar masses are usually only 3 per cent of the central tellar masses while in kinetic feedback runs, this ratio is larger, eaching 10 per cent. Therefore, it is not surprising that in the hermal feedback runs we do not see core formation as the ejected tellar mass is almost negligible compared to the total stellar mass in he central region. Our results indicate that the AGN feedback model an play an important role in the formation of cores in gas-rich galaxy ergers.\nCompared to the gas-free galaxy merger simulations, which roduce large cores with radii of a few hundred parsecs to even few kiloparsecs (e.g. Rantala et al. 2018 ; Nasim et al. 2021 ), ur galaxy remnants are mostly cuspy galaxies or cored galaxies ith small cores (i.e. r b 100 pc). The following arguments explain his difference. First, in gas-free simulations of massive elliptical alaxies, the BH masses are usually much higher (e.g. M BH \u223c10 9 \u2013 0 10 M ), which will lead to more significant stellar ejections and hus assist in the formation of larger cores. Secondly, unlike gas-free imulations, there are new stars forming in the galaxy central region, hich will dominate the central density in g as-rich g alaxy mergers see the dashed lines in Fig. 13 ). This replenishment of stars can inder the formation of a large core, i.e. these new stars will interact ith the BH binary and drive it to merge in a shorter time-scale; eanwhile, they can also increase the central stellar density, both f which can make the core formation mechanism less ef fecti ve. specially in the thermal feedback runs, star formation is stronger nd the central stellar profiles remain cuspy.\nFinally, we note that observations have revealed that bright ellipical galaxies ( M V \u221222) tend to have core-lik e surf ace brightness rofiles, while fainter elliptical galaxies ( M V \u221220) tend to have teeper profiles that lack cores, and at intermediate magnitudes, both ypes coe xist (e.g. F aber et al. 1997 ; Trujillo et al. 2004 ; Lauer t al. 2007 ). As our simulated galaxy remnants are elliptical galaxies oughly in the intermediate-mass range, the results that only some f them exhibit small cores and some of them even have no cores re consistent with these observations. For our simulated galaxy emnants which e xhibit cores, the y broadly agree with the observed elation between BH masses and core radii provided in Thomas et al. 2016 ).\nDI SCUSSI ONS\nn this section, we discuss the caveats of our BH binary accretion nd feedback model and the impro v ements that we can introduce in he future.\n(i) Fitting formulae from circumbinary disc simulations. In our biary BH model, the preferential mass accretion behaviour is included y adopting the fitting formula from circumbinary disc simulations. o we ver, all the formulae shown in Fig. 2 are fitted from simulations ith circular ( e = 0) BH binaries, and therefore strictly speaking, t is not fully self-consistent to apply these formulae to eccentric H binaries in our simulations. There have been circumbinary disc imulations of eccentric BH binaries (e.g. Artymowicz & Lubow 996 ; Hayasaki et al. 2007 ; Cuadra et al. 2009 ; Roedig et al. 2011 ; u \u0303 noz, Miranda & Lai 2019 ; Zrake et al. 2021 ), but there are still no tting formulae available for such eccentric cases and the sampled arameters, such as the mass ratio and eccentricity, are still fairly imited in these studies (but see the recent work of Siwek et al. 2023 , or a systematic exploration of the binary mass ratio and eccentricity arameter space). Depending on the different binary mass ratios, the inary eccentricity might lead to suppressed or enhanced preferential ccretion compared to the circular case (see Siwek et al. 2023 ).\nThus, how the BH accretion rate ratio depends on both the binary ass ratio and the eccentricity is still an ongoing research topic\nnd hopefully a robust fitting formula will be provided from the ommunity in the near future. The fitting formula implemented in ur code is a module which can be easily changed and updated, and it ill be straightforward to incorporate an impro v ed formula. We note hat similar to our approach, the fitting formulae from circular BH inaries have also been adopted in some semi-analytical modelling tudies, see e.g. Kelley et al. ( 2019 ).\nMNRAS 520, 4463\u20134489 (2023)\nM\nb b a e c 2 e V o\nc t e t d T e a e m a s\nE i o A 2 d ( M 2 f b w i T e t p a r 0 T w p a i t a c p u s f B f b I i o\no m i G h b a b P a T t ( m\nm q a u c 2 2 a i b k b g w s s W k\n7\nI m c p\nB 1 s i s 2 s t c a c a c e k t a\ni\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/520/3/4463/7031773 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nWe further caution that the existing fitting formulae are usually ased on two-dimensional simulations which assume that the BH inary is coplanar with the circumbinary disc. The simulations also ssume a specific disc thickness and viscosity, and also ignore the ffect of AGN feedback. Note that much of the parameter space of ircumbinary disc simulations remains unexplored (Lai & Mu \u0303 noz 022 ). See recent works of Dittmann & Ryan ( 2022 ) for a systematic xploration of the disc thickness and viscosity, and finally see del alle & Volonteri ( 2018 ) for a study on the effects of AGN feedback n the evolution of the BH binary + circumbinary disc system. (ii) Circumbinary disc\u2013BH binary torque interactions. In a cirumbinary disc\u2013BH binary system, apart from the mass accretion, he gravitational torque from the disc could also affect the orbital volution of the BH. The torque experienced by the binary (i.e. he rate of change of the angular momentum of the binary due to isc\u2013binary interaction, J\u0307 bin ) is composed of two parts, i.e. J\u0307 bin = grav + J\u0307 acc , where T grav is the gravitational torque from all fluid lements (including the circumbinary disc, streams, and mini-discs), nd J\u0307 acc is the angular momentum change due to accretion. Note that ven if the accreted gas has zero total angular momentum, adding its ass to the binary can increase the angular momentum of the binary, nd therefore a part of J\u0307 acc has been modelled automatically in our ubgrid model.\nHo we ver, the modelling of T grav is a much more complicated story. arly analytical and numerical works suggest that T grav is ne gativ e,\n.e. the BH binary loses angular momentum to the disc and shrinks its rbit, thus the disc-binary interaction assists the BH coalescence (e.g. rtymowicz et al. 1991 ; Pringle 1991 ; MacFadyen & Milosavljevi \u0301c 008 ). In contrast, several recent numerical works investigating the isc\u2013binary interaction in more detail show that T grav is positive Miranda, Mu \u0303 noz & Lai 2017 ; Tang, MacFadyen & Haiman 2017 ;\noody, Shi & Stone 2019 ; Mu \u0303 noz et al. 2019 , 2020 ; Duffell et al. 020 ; Dittmann & Ryan 2021 ), i.e. although the gravitational torque rom the circumbinary disc (region with radius r 2 a with a eing the binary semimajor axis) is ne gativ e (as expected in early orks), the torque from the gas in the innermost region ( r a) s o v erwhelmingly positiv e, leading to a positiv e total torque T grav . his implies that the binary gains net angular momentum and its orbit xpands, suggesting that the circumbinary disc may prevent rather han assist the BH merger. Follow-up simulations further find that the ositive T grav from these numerical works might originate from their ssumption of a thick circumbinary disc, i.e. a disc with an aspect atio (i.e. the ratio between the disc thickness h and radius r ) of h / r = .1 or equi v alently Mach number of M = 10 (Heath & Nixon 2020 ; iede et al. 2020 ; Dittmann & Ryan 2022 ). These authors show that ith a thinner disc (e.g. h/r 0 . 04 or M 25), which is more referred for AGN, the inner edge of the circumbinary disc is denser nd its ne gativ e torque can dominate; as a result, the total torque T grav s ne gativ e and the binary migrates inwards instead of outwards. Note hat T grav might also depend on the viscosity (Dittmann & Ryan 2022 ) nd the sink prescription (Dittmann & Ryan 2021 ). Given all these omplexities and the ongoing debates in the literature, unlike the referential mass accretion, the modelling of T grav is much more ncertain and difficult, and we do not include it in our current ubgrid accretion model. We note that even without including the ull disc\u2013binary interacting torque in our simulations, all simulated H binaries merge within a few hundred Myr, suggesting that the star ormation in gas-rich galaxy mergers is efficient enough in driving the inary to the regime of GW emission through slingshot interactions. t will be interesting to incorporate the disc\u2013binary torque interaction nto our subgrid model in the future when a sophisticated modelling f T grav is available from circumbinary disc simulations.\nNRAS 520, 4463\u20134489 (2023)\n(iii) Accretion of gas angular momentum. In this work, we focus n the mass accretion of BHs and ignore the accretion of gas angular omentum and the resulting evolution of BH spins, which are mportant when modelling spin-driven jet AGN feedback and the W recoil kicks at the last stage of BH coalescence. Recently, there ave been a range of attempts to improve the BH subgrid model y taking into account the BH spins. For example, mass accretion nd spin evolution based on the Shakura\u2013Sunyaev \u03b1-disc model has een considered in e.g. Dubois et al. ( 2014 ), Fiacconi, Sijacki & ringle ( 2018 ), Bustamante & Springel ( 2019 ), Cenci et al. ( 2021 ), nd the spin-driven jet AGN feedback have been implemented in e.g. albot, Bourne & Sijacki ( 2021 ) and Hu \u030csko et al. ( 2022 ). Note that he circumbinary disc can also affect the spins of the merging BHs e.g. Steinle & Gerosa 2023 ). We leave the construction of a subgrid odel for BH spin evolution due to gas accretion for future work. (iv) Two-mode feedback model. Usually, a combined twoode AGN feedback (for example, thermal/kinetic feedback for uasar/radio mode) is preferred in galaxy formation simulations s this is moti v ated by observ ations and has been shown to be seful in reproducing the observed galaxy properties in modern osmological simulations (e.g. Sijacki et al. 2007 ; Dubois et al. 012 ; Hirschmann et al. 2014 ; Steinborn et al. 2015 ; Grand et al. 017 ; Weinberger et al. 2017 ; Dav \u0301e et al. 2019 ). Here, as a first ttempt to introduce a BH binary accretion model, we aim to study f and how different AGN feedback implementations affect the BH inary evolution, and thus we use either a pure thermal or a pure inetic feedback model in our simulations. Similar approaches have een adopted in previous simulation studies of isolated or merging alaxies (e.g. Barai et al. 2014 , 2016 ). Note that a two-mode model ill introduce more parameters (e.g. the accretion rate criterion to witch between the two modes) and usually, it is difficult to calibrate uch additional parameters with idealized galaxy merger simulations. e leave the introduction of a two-mode AGN feedback model for etju simulations for future work.\nC O N C L U S I O N S\nn this work, we introduce a BH binary accretion and feedback odel for the KETJU code, which enables us to resolve the entire BH oalescence process in gas-rich galaxy merger simulations in a more hysically moti v ated way. Our BH binary accretion model is a natural extension of the HL accretion model (Hoyle & Lyttleton 1939 ; Bondi & Hoyle 944 ; Bondi 1952 ), which has been widely used in galactic-scale imulations (Di Matteo et al. 2005 ; Springel et al. 2005 ), and it also ncorporates the results from small-scale viscous hydrodynamical imulations of circumbinary discs (Farris et al. 2014 ; Duffell et al. 020 ). Specifically, our model adopts a simple switch between the ingle and binary BH phases. In the single BH phase, we follow he traditional BHL accretion model, whereas in the binary phase, a ircumbinary disc subgrid model is introduced. When two BHs form bound binary, the total accretion rate on to the circumbinary disc is omputed with the BHL accretion model but using the gas properties t the binary centre of mass, while the fitted formula from small-scale ircumbinary disc simulations is adopted to assign the accretion to ach BH. The AGN feedback is implemented with both thermal and inetic approaches. In the binary phase, the kick velocity direction of he kinetic feedback is set to be parallel or antiparallel to the orbital ngular momentum direction of the BH binary.\nTo test and demonstrate the behaviour of the model, we perform dealized galaxy merger simulations with two gas-rich disc galaxies\na f\nt w h s a r a t m e r m i 2\nm \u223c l c s f e s t f O t s k\ne s b r f ( e\ns o g H m s d c a m d \u223c g i\np o g s f t\nf c\nt a e m f e f s\nA\nW r t G o s f g c S\np M ( 2\nD\nT r\nR\nA A A A\nA A A A A A\nB B\nB\nB\nB B B B B B\nB\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/520/3/4463/7031773 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nnd consider both pure thermal AGN feedback and pure kinetic AGN eedback in our runs. Our major findings are summarized as follows.\n(i) Accretion behaviour of BH binaries. We demonstrate that using he CoM properties of the BH binary in the BHL formula is important hen estimating the accretion on to the BH binary, otherwise the igh inspiral BH velocities in the tight binary phase will artificially uppress the BH accretion rates and the AGN feedback strength, nd lead to unphysical abrupt jumps in the evolution of accretionelated quantities. Furthermore, as a result of the preferential mass ccretion from circumbinary disc simulations, the BH binaries tend owards equal-masses in our simulations. Note that such an impro v ed odelling for BH binary accretion is of paramount importance, specially for gas-rich galaxy mergers which have higher accretion ates, as the BH binary accretion behaviour directly affects the BH ass ratio before coalescence which is one of the key parameters n computing the GW-induced recoil velocity (Campanelli et al. 007 ). (ii) BH merger time-scales. All BH binaries in our simulation erge rapidly, and the merger time-scales range from \u223c10 up to 400 Myr. In gas-rich galaxy mergers, the tidal torque drives a arge amount of gas to the galaxy centre, triggering starbursts which an replenish the loss cone of the BH binary and lead to o v erall horter time-scales compared to gas-free galaxy mergers (especially or binaries with lower eccentricities, e.g. Khan et al. 2012b ; Rantala t al. 2018 ). In our simulations, the orbital geometry with stronger tarbursts (i.e. the co-planar prograde equal-mass merger G0) tends o have shorter BH merger time-scales (e.g. \u223c10 Myr in the thermal eedback model and \u223c100 Myr in the kinetic feedback model). verall, in the kinetic AGN feedback runs, BHs merge over longer ime-scales (i.e. from \u223c100 to \u223c400 Myr, compared with the timecales from \u223c10 to \u223c200 Myr in the thermal feedback runs), as inetic feedback quenches star formation more efficiently. (iii) Dynamical ejection of stars. We use the change in the total nergy of star particles before and after the binary phase to identify tar particles which experienced strong dynamical kicks by the BH inary. We find that the total mass of the ejected star particles is oughly half of the total BH mass, agreeing with a similar correlation ound from observations and gas-free galaxy merger simulations Milosavljevi \u0301c et al. 2002 ; Merritt 2006 ). We also show that the jected stars tend to have young stellar ages.\n(iv) Formation of cuspy and cored elliptical galaxies. Due to the tar ejection by the BH binary, the central stellar density profiles of ur galaxy remnants tend to be lower compared to those in traditional adget simulations which do not resolve the BH binary dynamics. o we ver, unlike gas-free simulations of massive elliptical galaxy ergers (Rantala et al. 2018 ; Nasim et al. 2021 ), there are new tars forming in the galaxy central region, which increase the central ensity in gas-rich galaxies, and can thus hinder the formation of large ores. As a result, all merger remnants in the thermal feedback runs re cuspy galaxies because of the strong star formation acti vity. A fe w erged galaxies in the kinetic feedback runs exhibit core-like surface ensity profiles with small cores (i.e. core radii range from \u223c50 to 100 parsecs). Overall, our results agree with the observed elliptical alaxies at the intermediate magnitude range ( \u221222 M V \u221220) n which cuspy and cored ellipticals coexist (Faber et al. 1997 ).\n(v) Impacts of different AGN feedback implementations. Both our ure thermal and pure kinetic feedback simulations reproduce the bserved galaxy scaling relations such as the M BH \u2013\u03c3 relation, the alaxy size\u2013stellar mass relation, and the hot gas X-ray luminosity\u2013 tellar mass relation. As summarized abo v e, we also notice that AGN eedback models play an essential role for setting the BH merger ime-scales and for the formation of cores. This indicates that AGN\needback models are a crucial ingredient in modelling the BH binary oalescence in a cosmological galaxy formation context.\nOur newly introduced BH binary accretion and feedback model in he KETJU code can be further applied to cosmological simulations by dding a BH seeding scheme (Sijacki et al. 2007 ) as in Mannerkoski t al. ( 2022 ) and extending the model to multiple BH systems. BH ergers in late-type g as-rich g alaxies are one of the major targets for uture spaceborne GW observatories, such as LISA (Amaro-Seoane t al. 2022 ) and TianQin (Luo et al. 2016 ). Our model will be useful or improving the modelling of these targets in galaxy formation imulations.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\ne thank Thorsten Naab for valuable discussions and the anonymous eferee for helpful comments.

To save computational ime, we perform all test runs in this appendix using the gadget mode. s we have shown in Section 5 , when the parameter values calibrated ith the gadget runs are applied to the ketju + binary accretion runs, he simulated scaling relations agree well with the observations. This s not surprising since the ketju runs have very similar overall BH rowth and star formation histories as compared to the gadget runs Section 5.1 ).\nAll tests are run with the DD-11-G0 galaxy merger, and except or the BH model parameters, all other parameters are identical in all uns. To study the effects of the feedback efficiency parameter f, kin , e fix the reservoir threshold parameter to f thr = 20, which is the alue used in the Illustris TNG simulations (Weinberger et al. 2017 ), nd perform five runs with f, kin = 0.0025, 0.005, 0.008, 0.01, and .02. To study how f thr affects the BH growth and the star formation, e fix f, kin = 0.008, and perform four additional runs with f thr = 2, , 10, and 40. In Fig. A1 , we present the time-evolution of the total SFRs, the otal BH accretion rates, and the total BH masses for the kinetic eedback runs. In the left panels, we hav e fix ed f thr = 20 but vary f, kin , while in the right panels, the tests are run with fixed f, kin = .008 but varying f thr . We also o v erplot the results from a pure thermal eedback run with f, th = 0.02 (black line) for comparison.\nThe BH accretion rates and BH masses are more sensitive to the eedback efficiency parameter. With a higher f, kin , the total feedback nergy from the radiated luminosity is higher, and the BH accretion ate is more significantly suppressed with the final BH mass being o wer. By v arying f, kin o v er an order of magnitude, from 0.0025 to .02, the o v erall BH accretion rate (and the final BH mass) also differs y roughly an order of magnitude. In contrast, the BH accretion rate nd the final BH mass are less sensitive to f thr . With a higher f thr , he strength of each individual AGN feedback event is stronger, but he feedback events are less frequent. The test runs show that the atter effect tends to be more impactful for BH growth, i.e. as the eedback events are less frequent, the BHs tend to have slightly higher ccretion rates. When f thr varies from 2 to 40, the BH accretion rate nd the final BH mass only change by a factor of \u223c2.\nThe star formation history is more sensitive to the reservoir hreshold parameter, in agreement with the findings in Weinberger\nMNRAS 520, 4463\u20134489 (2023)\nM\nFigure A1. The star formation and BH growth histories in the DD-11-G0 merger runs with different kinetic feedback model parameters. From top to bottom panels, the time-evolution of the total SFR, the total BH accretion rate, and the total BH mass are plotted. In the left column, the results from different kinetic feedback runs with varying f, kin (but with fixed f thr = 20) are shown, whereas in the right column, the results from different kinetic feedback runs with varying f thr (but with fixed f, kin = 0.008) are given. In all panels, the run with thermal feedback is plotted with black lines, while the run with our fiducial kinetic feedback model parameters (i.e. f, kin = 0.008 and f thr = 20) is shown with red lines. The filled circles mark the merging of the BHs. Note that the total SFR and the total BH accretion rate are averaged over 10 Myr in this figure.\ne w c e t p f\na b\nM\nr A i w ( o\ng i t c i\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/520/3/4463/7031773 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024 t al. ( 2017 ). In the top left panel of Fig. A1 , kinetic feedback runs ith different f, kin show quite similar star formation histories. In\nontrast, in the top right panel, when f thr increases from 2 to 40, it is vident that the SFRs decrease by a factor of a few (especially after he first passage). This suggests that with a stronger AGN feedback ulse, it is more ef fecti ve to kick out and shock-heat the gas, and thus urther quenching the star formation in a galaxy.\nThe aforementioned impacts of f, kin and f thr on the BH growth nd star formation history indicates that the following methods can e used to calibrate these parameters: (i) We can use the scaling relations related to the BH masses, e.g. BH \u2013\u03c3 relation, to constrain f, kin . In Fig. A2 , we plot the galaxy\nNRAS 520, 4463\u20134489 (2023)\nemnants from all the kinetic feedback runs on the M BH \u2013\u03c3 plane. s expected, the location of a galaxy remnant on the M BH \u2013\u03c3 plane s more sensitive to f, kin , and the runs with f, kin = 0.008 agree well ith the best-fitting observed M BH \u2013\u03c3 relation from van den Bosch 2016 ). Therefore, we choose 0.008 as the fiducial value for f, kin in ur simulations presented in the main text. (ii) We can use the observations of the star formation history or alaxy g as mass fractions to constrain f thr . This can be readily done n cosmological galaxy formation simulations (e.g. by comparing he evolution of the cosmic SFR density to observations), but it annot be done with idealized galaxy merger simulations as the nitial conditions are ideally generated and the galaxy samples are\nFigure A2. The M BH \u2013\u03c3 relation for the merger remnants from the DD11-G0 merger runs with different kinetic feedback model parameters. The fiducial run is shown with a red filled circle. The runs with varying f, kin but fixed f thr = 20 are shown with downward triangles, while the runs with varying f thr but fixed f, kin = 0.008 are shown with upward triangles. The error bars show the 3 \u03c3 uncertainty of the LOS velocity dispersion computed from 50 random LOS directions. The observational data points (grey scatter points with error bars or upper limits) and the best-fitting observed M BH \u2013 \u03c3 relation (black solid line) are from van den Bosch ( 2016 ), with the grey shaded regions denoting one and three times the intrinsic scatter.\nFigure A3.

Therefore, in this study, we simply adopt the value of f thr = 0 suggested in Weinberger et al. ( 2017 ) as our fiducial value. In he future two-mode AGN feedback model for ketju cosmological imulations, we can use the cosmic SFR density to provide a better alibration of this parameter.\nAs f thr controls the feedback strength and thus the kick velocities f gas neighbours, it is interesting to study the gas kick velocities in uns with different f thr (fixed f, kin = 0.008) and compare them to the bserved AGN outflow velocities. In Fig. A3 , for each test run, we ompute the maximum kick velocity, v kick, max , from each feedback vent and plot the probability distribution function (PDF) of v kick, max rom all feedback events during the whole run. As expected, with higher f thr , the median v kick, max is higher. With the fiducial value thr = 20, the median v kick, max is \u223c5000 km s \u22121 and in some feedback vents, v kick, max can reach \u223c10 4 km s \u22121 , in agreement with the typical\nas outflow velocities from observations (Crenshaw et al. 2003 ; Laha t al. 2021 ). Note that a fix ed kick v elocity of a few thousand to 0 4 km s \u22121 has been implemented in many previous kinetic AGN eedback models (see e.g. Choi et al. 2012 , 2014 , 2015 ; Debuhr et al. 012 ; Barai et al. 2014 , 2016 ; Angl \u0301es-Alc \u0301azar et al. 2017 ; Torrey t al. 2020 ). The agreement with observations and other simulation odels support the notion that our adopted fiducial value for f thr is a easonable choice. In Fig. A1 , by comparing the pure thermal feedback and pure inetic feedback runs, we find that they have qualitatively similar star ormation and BH growth histories. Especially, our fiducial kinetic odel (red lines) gives a fairly similar BH growth history as in the ducial thermal feedback run (black lines). Ho we ver, quantitati vely he kinetic feedback model is more ef fecti ve at quenching star ormation compared to the thermal feedback model.\nPPENDI X B: D D - 1 1 - G 5 KI NETI C AG N EEDB AC K R U N S\ns shown in Fig. 13 , the DD-11-G5 kinetic feedback simulation s a clear outlier which exhibits significantly different behaviour ompared to other simulations, i.e. at t = 1.80 Gyr, the ketju central tellar density is remarkably higher than the gadget density even hough they are very similar at t = 1.55 Gyr (Fig. 12 ). In this ppendix, we investigate the cause of this difference.\nIn order to do this, we have rerun both the ketju + binary accretion nd gadget runs starting from the snapshots at t = 1.45 Gyr (i.e. napshot 29 in the original runs) and increased the output frequency ith an output interval of \u223c2.5 Myr (compared to the interval of 50 Myr in the original runs). These two new runs continue until t = .60 Gyr, and each of them has 60 output snapshots. These outputs ith higher time resolution enable us to better examine the galaxy erging process and the BH evolution. Fig. B1 shows the evolution of the central stellar and gas distribuions in both the ketju (upper two rows) and gadget (lower two rows) uns from t = 1.485 to 1.5 Gyr. Overall, at t = 1.485 Gyr, the largecale patterns of the gas tidal arms are quite similar in both runs. o we ver, within the tidal arm, in the ketju run the gas tends to be ore compact in the top-left corner, while in the gadget run it tends o be smoother. This small difference in the gas tidal arms leads to inor differences in the star formation, i.e. in the ketju run the small tellar clumps are more compact and clustered (marked by the white rrow), while in the gadget run they are more diffuse and are more eparately distributed along the arm. In the subsequent evolution, mall stellar clumps in the ketju run merge to form an ultra-compact tellar clump orbiting the galaxy centre in which the secondary BH esides, amplifying the initial small difference in a runaway manner. n contrast, in the gadget run the stellar clumps remain diffuse and eparated while moving along the tidal arm.\nAfter t = 1.500 Gyr, the ultra-compact stellar clump continues to rbit the galaxy centre of the secondary BH and gradually sinks to he central region. We plot the later evolution of the stellar densities n both runs in Fig. B2 .\nAt the snapshot with t = 1.551 Gyr, we identify the ultra-compact tellar clump (marked by the white arrow) using the Friends-ofriends (FoF, Davis et al. 1985 ) method with a linking length of 5 pc. he identified FoF clump has a total stellar mass of 4 . 8 \u00d7 10 8 M nd a stellar half-mass radius of 16.3 pc. Possible observational nalogues of this ultra-compact clump are ultra-compact dwarfs UCDs) for which masses are 10 6 M 10 8 M and the ef fecti ve adii are 10 R e 100 pc (Mieske et al. 2008 ; Brodie et al. 2011 ). n terms of mass and size, the ultra-compact clump in our simulation\nMNRAS 520, 4463\u20134489 (2023)\nM\nFigure B1. Formation of an ultra-compact stellar clump in the ketju run. The evolution of the central stellar and gas distributions around the secondary BH (marked by black dots) in the ketju run is plotted in the first and second ro w, respecti vely, and the third and fourth rows show the same for the gadget run. The distribution is projected along the y -axis direction and plotted on the xz -plane. In the first row, the targeted compact stellar clumps are indicated with white arrows. From left to right columns, the snapshots at t = 1.485, 1.491, 1.495, and 1.500 Gyr are plotted.\ni g 1 S f s ( f\nt c t c d f\no k s 1 i r d b\nt r S t c p\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/520/3/4463/7031773 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024 s similar to the most massive known UCDs located near the elliptical alaxy M59, M59-UCD3, which has a dynamical mass of a few times 0 8 M and an ef fecti ve radius of around 20 pc (Liu et al. 2015 ; andoval et al. 2015 ). One of the possible formation mechanisms or UCDs is that they are stellar superclusters merged from smaller tar clusters formed in the tidal arms of g as-rich g alaxy mergers Fellhauer & Kroupa 2002 , 2005 ), which is quite similar to the ormation process seen in our simulations.\nAs the ultra-compact clump mo v es close to the galaxy centre of he secondary BH, it affects the motion of the secondary BH. The lump and the BH orbit each other, leading to the helix-like BH rajectory, as shown in the first row of Fig. B2 . At t \u223c 1.59 Gyr, this lump finally merges into the galaxy remnant and boosts the central ensity in the ketju run. The stellar density profiles at t = 1.600 Gyr or both the ketju and gadget runs are shown in the rightmost panel\nNRAS 520, 4463\u20134489 (2023)\nf the bottom row. To further confirm that the density bump in the etju run is indeed due to the ultra-compact clump, we exclude the tar particles which belong to the FoF group identified in the t = .551 Gyr snapshot and re-compute the stellar density profile which s shown with the magenta solid line. We can clearly see that after emoving the contribution from the ultra-compact clump, the stellar ensity profile in the central region decreases significantly and agrees etter with the gadget one. As a final test, we start with the ketju snapshot at t = 1.55 Gyr (i.e. he \u2018before\u2019 snapshot), which contains the ultra-compact clump, and un with the gadget mode until t = 1.80 Gyr (the \u2018after\u2019 snapshot). ince the effect of the ultra-compact clump is included in this gadget est run, we can better isolate the effect of star ejections when omparing it with the original ketju run. The final stellar density rofile centred on the merged BH is plotted with the green curve\nFigure B2. The impact of the ultra-compact stellar clump on the BH trajectory and stellar density profile. The first row shows the evolution of the stellar distribution from t = 1.551 to 1.600 Gyr in the ketju run. The targeted ultra-compact stellar clump in the ketju run is indicated with white arrows in the three left panels, and in the rightmost panel this clump has already merged into the galaxy remnant centre. The secondary and primary BHs are marked by black and grey dots, respectively, and their trajectories since t = 1.551 Gyr are plotted with black and grey solid lines. The second row shows similar plots but for the gadget run. Note that in the gadget run, two BHs merge at t = 1.584 Gyr; after that only the primary BH (grey) is plotted (i.e. the rightmost panel). The third row shows the spherically averaged stellar density profiles centred on the secondary BH (or the merged BH in the rightmost panel for the gadget run) in both ketju (orange solid) and gadget (blue dashed) runs. The vertical dotted lines mark the stellar softening length and the ketju radius 3 . In the rightmost panel, the magenta solid line shows the stellar density profile in the ketju run after removing the particles of the ultra-compact stellar clump identified using the FoF method.\nFigure B3.

Now we can see the same behaviour as in the other imulations shown in Fig. 13 when comparing the ketju and the adget test runs, i.e. the central stellar density in the ketju run ends to be lower than the gadget one due to the gravitational lingshot ejection. Quantitatively, the ketju-to-gadget enclosed mass atio within the ketju radius changes from 12.49 in the original gadget un to 0.53 in this test gadget run. We have also performed similar ests for other galaxy merger runs in Fig. 13 , and confirmed that the entral density profiles at the \u2018after\u2019 snapshots of the test gadget runs re all higher than their ketju counterparts, further supporting our iscussions in Section 5.5 , which were based on the other galaxy erger runs.\nhis paper has been typeset from a T E X/L A T E X file prepared by the author.\nMNRAS 520, 4463\u20134489 (2023)\nchnology Patna user on 19 January 2024"
