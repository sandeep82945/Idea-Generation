    "abstractText": "Summary The role of integrating genomic scores (GSs) needs to be assessed. Adding a GS to recommended stratification tools does not improve the prediction of very low bone mineral density. However, we noticed that the GS performed equally or above individual risk factors in discrimination. Purpose We aimed to investigate whether adding a genomic score (GS) to recommended stratification tools improves the discrimination of participants with very low bone mineral density (BMD). Methods BMD was measured in three thoracic vertebrae using CT. All participants provided information on standard osteoporosis risk factors. GSs and FRAX scores were calculated. Participants were grouped according to mean BMD into very low (<80 mg/cm3), low (80\u2013120 mg/cm3), and normal (>120 mg/cm3) and according to the Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation recommendations for BMD testing into an \u201cindication for BMD testing\u201d and \u201cno indication for BMD testing\u201d group. Different models were assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC) and reclassification analyses. Results In the total cohort (n=1421), the AUC for the GS was 0.57 (95% CI 0.52\u20130.61) corresponding to AUCs for osteoporosis risk factors. In participants without indication for BMD testing, the AUC was 0.60 (95% CI 0.52\u20130.69) above or equal to AUCs for osteoporosis risk factors. Adding the GS to a clinical risk factor (CRF) model resulted in AUCs not statistically significant from the CRF model. Using probability cutoff values of 6, 12, and 24%, we found no improved reclassification or risk discrimination using the CRF-GS model compared to the CRF model. Conclusion Our results suggest adding a GS to a CRF model does not improve prediction. However, we noticed that the GS performed equally or above individual risk factors in discrimination. Clinical risk factors combined showed superior discrimination to individual risk factors and the GS, underlining the value of combined CRFs in routine clinics as a stratification tool.",

            "text": "Osteoporosis is a major health problem due to low diagnostic rates and disease-related consequences, such as osteoporotic fractures and increased mortality. Despite being a frequent and preventable disease, screening tests and referral to diagnostic tests have not increased diagnostic rates sufficiently [1, 2].\nQuantitative computed tomography (CT) is a relatively new promising method for identifying high-risk individuals using CT scans to quantify bone mineral density (BMD). BMD is a well-known surrogate marker of osteoporosis [3]. Opportunistic screening using CT scans has the benefits of using pre-existing scans made for various clinical indications. We have recently demonstrated that spine BMD measured from routine cardiac CT scans is associated with fracture rate in a large group of individuals referred to cardiac CT [4]. Furthermore, we have documented that a substantial proportion of individuals (179/1487; 12%) referred to routine cardiac CT have very low BMD (thoracic spine BMD<80 mg/cm3) [5]. These findings suggest a feasibility using CT for opportunistic screening to increase diagnostic rates and identify high-risk osteoporotic individuals.\nCurrent screening guidelines differ between countries and in lack of validated screening strategies, individual risk stratification is often based on identifying osteoporosis risk factors [6, 7]. The Fracture Risk Assessment tool (FRAX) can be used to assess an individual\u2019s absolute 10-year fracture probability based on clinical risk factors with or without BMD measurements [8]. Recently, a randomized controlled trial has shown the benefits of using FRAX to screen women for further BMD assessment and pharmacological treatment\nby reducing hip fractures [9], underlining the clinical value of screening using FRAX.\nHowever, the ability of FRAX to discriminate between men with fractures versus men without fractures is limited [10]. Screening using either a model including risk factors for osteoporosis or FRAX could possibly be improved by adding the individuals\u2019 inherent risk of osteoporosis, especially in individuals otherwise not identified using standard screening tools.\nOsteoporosis is a polygenic disease associated with a strong heritability (twin study-based H2-estimates range between 0.77 and 0.89 for lumbar and femoral neck BMD [11]); hence, family predisposition is a strong independent risk factor for osteoporosis [12, 13]. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous genetic variants associated with BMD and/or osteoporotic fractures [14\u201317] from which a genomic score (GS) can be constructed [18]. The GS, also known as a polygenic score, is the sum of common alleles an individual carries weighted by the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effect size estimated from GWAS. A GS could be a promising tool to identify patients with very low BMD otherwise invisible in the daily clinic. BMD measurements are accessible and relatively cheap; however, patients with osteoporosis often go undiagnosed. Research in genetic risk profiling and focus on personalized medicine have increased in recent years and could be a valuable tool for assessing the risk of very low BMD in the future. However, the clinical role of integrating GSs in medical clinics to improve the selection of individuals for BMD testing needs to be further assessed. We hypothesize that a GS adds value to the identification of patients with very low BMD based on a clinical risk factor model.\nTherefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether adding GS to recommended stratification tools improves the discrimination of participants with very low BMD."

The selected thoracic vertebrae have previously been demonstrated to include Th6 (11%), Th7 (48%), Th8 (37%), and Th9 (4%) [20]. The Mindways QCT Pro software (Mindways Software Inc, TX) was used to measure BMD together with the calibration phantom, Mindways Solid 3 (Mindways Software Inc, TX) as previously described [5]. The mean BMD was grouped as very low (<80 mg/cm3), low (80\u2013120 mg/ cm3), and normal BMD (>120 mg/cm3) as described by the American College of Radiology (ACR) for lumbar spine QCT [21]."

Current systemic glucocorticoid use was defined as a redeemed prescription within 6 months prior to the baseline visit. All participants with self-reported or known rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease, colitis ulcerosa, osteogenesis imperfecta, severe scoliosis, Scheuermann\u2019s disease, lymphoma, leukemia, or myelomatosis were excluded from BMD analyses; thus, these risk factors were considered as not present for the entire cohort.

The summary statistics for the GSFN_BMD were based on a GWAS meta-analysis assessing femoral neck (FN) BMD measured by DXA in 32,961 individuals with populations from both Europe, America, East Asia, and Australia [14]. Only 54 SNPs associated with BMD were publicly available.

Furthermore, we evaluated the ability of reclassifying participants using the CRF model vs. the CRF+GS model using pre-test probability cutoff values of 6%, 12%, and 24% [29]. These cutoff values were based on the prevalence (p) of having very low BMD (12%) in the total cohort, by calculating p/2, p, and 2p, as recommended when clinical cutoff values do not exist [30]. The net reclassification index (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were calculated. In order to internally validate the CRF and CRF+GS model, we compared AUCs with the FRAX and FRAX+GS model (not fitted to the current study [31]) and tested AUCs using 5-fold cross-validation [32]. A P value<0.05 was considered statistically significant and in multiple comparisons, P values were adjusted according to the Bonferroni adjustment (P value/ntests) when relevant. Sample size calculation has previously been published [19]. All analyses were performed using STATA/IC 17.0 (StataCorp, College Station, Tex).\n(1)yBMD = GSTB_BMD +\n(2)yBMD = CRF +\n(3)yBMD = CRF + GSTB_BMD +\n(4)yBMD = FRAX +\n1 3"

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "In the present study, the GS was weakly associated with mean BMD as measured from cardiac CT scans (Supplementary Table S1). Nonetheless, the GS showed equal or greater discrimination than standard clinical risk factors, especially in participants without an indication for BMD testing. In participants without an indication for BMD testing, odds for having very low BMD per SD decrease in GS was 1.56 (95% CI 1.18\u20132.07, P<0.01) compared to 1.24 (95% CI 1.02\u20131.50, P<0.05) in participants with an indication for BMD testing. However, when performing reclassification analyses, no significant improvements in prediction were detected adding the GS to the CRF model in the total cohort nor in subgroup analyses inconsistent with our stated hypothesis.\nDespite not detecting any statistically significant improvement in the combined model\u2019s AUCs, a new predictor may add valuable improved prediction, as AUC is not suffcient to fully assess model performance. Often, despite improving the performance of a model, the increase in AUC is likely very small [29]. Furthermore, despite not adding statistically significant value, the combination of several risk factors can add value to prediction [33]. Therefore, we performed a reclassification analysis to further assess the contribution of the GS as a novel variable in risk assessment for identifying participants with very low mean BMD. To our knowledge, no other studies have assessed the clinical utility of adding a GS in a stratification algorithm to identify participants having very low BMD as measured from CT.\nThere is a need to assess the clinical relevance of genetic profiling, as recent developments have resulted in low costs and fast routine assessment of genetic profiles being available, making personalized disease-preventive measures possible. If GS becomes a routine assessment, the genetic risk of very low BMD could be evaluated if indicated and requested by the clinician and the patient.\nOur primary outcome was quantitative CT-measured BMD; however, GWASs have primarily focused on DXAor ultrasound-measured BMD and fracture risk [14, 16, 17], and to our knowledge, no GWAS have been conducted on CT-measured BMD. As differences in BMD measurements exist regarding units and measurement sites, this could reduce the discriminative performance of the GS and GScombined models in this study. BMD of the femoral neck by\n1 3\nDXA is used to diagnose osteoporosis, but total body BMD and BMD measured by ultrasound are not recommended for diagnosis according to the World Health Organization [34].\nHowever, we compared different genomic scores derived from these measurement sites (GSTB_BMD, GSFN_BMD, and GSHQ_SOS), including BMD femoral neck, in order to assess\nFig. 3 Discrimination of very low BMD stratified by indication for BMD testing. The area under receiver operating curves (AUC) using osteoporosis risk factors, the GS, and FRAX for discriminating participants having very low BMD stratified by indication for BMD testing as recommended by the Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation based on age, sex, and clinical risk factors [22]. In total, 580 participants indicated BMD testing (A) and 841 participants did not (B). AUC between the individual osteoporosis risk factors (including GS) was not statistically different in participants with indications for BMD testing (P=0.47). However, in participants without indication for BMD testing, the AUC for GS alone performed above some individual clinical risk factors (sex, active smoking, and secondary osteoporosis, all P<0.0063) and equally for previous osteoporosis-\nrelated fracture, family predisposition, BMI, and glucocorticoid treatment (all P>0.0063). Bonferroni correction (0.05/8=P<0.0063). Adding the GS to the FRAX and CRF model did improve the AUC, except for adding the GS to the FRAX in the group without indication for BMD testing; however, this was not statistically significant (all P>0.05). The GS and BMI were included as a continuous variable multiplied by \u22121, as higher values, thus indicating a higher risk. Abbr.: AUC area under receiver operating curves, BMD bone mineral density, BMI body mass index, CI confidence intervals, CRF clinical risk factors, FRAX (MOF) the 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fractures calculated by the Fracture Risk Assessment tool (without BMD), GS genomic score\n1 3\nthis in our study population and in a clinical context. We predefined the GSTB_BMD as our primary GS as it was based on a fully available GWAS summary statistic, and the GSTB_BMD (P<0.001) was selected for further analyses based on its strongest association to mean BMD in comparison to the other P value thresholds (Supplementary Table S1). There are numerous ways to calculate GSs [35], and our results are limited to this specific GS limiting generalizability to other GSs. The overall effect size of identified genetic variants is small, suggesting at present that GSs for prediction of fracture or low BMD alone have limited predictive power [36]. However, a GS may still be of clinical relevance combined with other clinically relevant predictors to fully capture the polygenic nature of osteoporosis. Furthermore, when GWASs for BMD further expand, the predictive power for discriminating disease likely increases.\nIt is important to assess both BMD-specific GSs (based on GWASs for BMD) and fracture-specific GSs (based on GWASs for fracture) to assess the relevance in a clinical context and for patient care. Individuals with BMD T score>2.5 and no osteoporosis risk factors do not generally have an indication for specific anti-osteoporosis treatment, despite most fragility fractures occur in individuals without osteoporosis [37, 38]. This fact highlights the need to optimize the identification of individuals at high fracture risk, who are otherwise overlooked. A BMD-specific GS can potentially help identify inherited very low BMD, and thus, high fracture risk, in younger individuals without clinical risk factors. Despite limited research in the management of osteoporosis in younger adults, it seems likely that these individuals represent a patient group, where diagnosis and early treatment\nmay impact positively the quality of life [39]. Furthermore, these young patients are likely to be missed using standard clinical stratification tools. Further research in screening, treatment, and prediction of fractures in younger adults is warranted.\nRecent studies suggest adding a GS in osteoporosis screening could reduce the number of patients who need BMD testing and improve overall fracture risk prediction [15, 16, 40]. Due to differences in clinical outcomes and designs, it is challenging to directly compare our results with other studies. Ho-Le et\u00a0al. (2017) assessed the predictive value of a BMD-associated genetic score for the incidence of radiographically verified fragility fractures. They documented that the genetic score improved the accuracy of fracture prediction above clinical risk factors [40]. Our primary outcome was CT-measured BMD, a surrogate marker of fracture risk, limiting direct comparison of outcomes. However, we have previously shown that CT-measured BMD in our cohort is associated with greater fracture rate, both incident osteoporosis-related fracture and any fracture, documenting the clinical feasibility of CT-measured BMD in predicting fractures across a broad age range [4]. Lu et\u00a0al. (2021) assessed a genetic score for heel quantitative speed of sound, which they found to improve fracture risk prediction above traditional clinical risk factors when adding it to FRAX. The clinical cutoff was set at 20% and 3% for the prediction of major osteoporotic fractures and hip fractures, based on the indication for treatment as recommended by the BHOF [16]. Our primary GS was based on total body BMD as previously described and we assessed a CRF model vs CRF-GS model using cutoff values at 6%, 12%, and 24 %.\n1 3\nAs the reclassification analysis is highly dependent on the cutoff values used, this limits direct comparison. We used FRAX as a reference platform to identify individuals at risk, as this model is validated for fracture probability, included in clinical guidelines and not fitted to the current study data [41]. However, FRAX does not identify very low BMD, but asses fracture risk and so, our primary focus was a clinical risk factor model including known osteoporosis risk factors. Having differences in outcome and designs in mind, we could not confirm previous findings suggesting adding a GS to recommended stratification tools could be of use in osteoporosis screening for personalized risk assessment.\nThe aim of adding a GS is to identify patients, who will benefit from interventions including medical treatment that will reduce fracture risk. Preventive interventions are especially cost-effective in high-risk individuals [42]. Based on our data, we found no benefit of adding a GS to a CRF model. Although DXA will likely always be favorable in availability and costs, future GSs might increase awareness of many silent diseases by identifying high-risk individuals. We noticed that the GS model performed equally or above individual clinical risk factors in discriminating individuals with very low BMD. This suggests that if general genetic profiling of the population or subgroups of the population becomes more common, a GS might be of value in identifying individuals at risk otherwise overlooked. The combined clinical risk factor model (and FRAX) showed superior discrimination to individual risk factors and the GS, underlining the value of combined CRFs in routine clinics as a stratification tool.\nOur results highlight the need to carefully evaluate the benefits of new predictors in different cohorts using different study designs before implementation."

            "text": "The strengths of this study include the consecutive inclusion of a homogenous study population of both men and women at two centers. Participants had free access to medical attention and were referred to cardiac CT by experienced cardiologists, limiting possible selection bias. All participants had relevant and extensive osteoporosis risk factors collected at their baseline visit and a trained reader (JT) performed BMD analyses and calculated FRAX for all participants. BHOF releases comprehensive recommendations to guide clinicians to prevent and treat osteoporosis worldwide, including guidelines for BMD testing [22], and despite countryspecific guidelines, we used these recommendations for a stratification algorithm to assess the GS in a clinical setting.\nLimitations include the following: [1] Only participants with European ancestry referred to cardiac CT were included; thus, the results from this study may not be extrapolated to other cohorts. [2] FRAX includes previous\nfractures (defined as spontaneous or low-energy fractures in adult life). However, we defined a previous osteoporosis-related fracture based on diagnostic codes from Danish registries recorded at Danish hospitals since 1995. These registries do not differentiate low- from high-energy fractures, nor could we include non-clinical fractures, such as vertebral fractures only detected on imaging or vertebral fractures without imaging. Participants were asked if they were predisposed to osteoporosis, including 1-degree relatives having osteoporosis or a history of hip fractures, and this was entered into the FRAX tool. Thus, a history alone describing parental hip fracture was not recorded despite being used in the FRAX tool. Current systemic glucocorticoid use was defined as a redeemed prescription recorded 6 months prior to the baseline visit; however, the FRAX tool defines use as either currently using or exposed for 3 months of minimum 5 mg daily. Secondary osteoporosis was here defined as type 1 diabetes mellitus, early menopause (<45 years), or a Charlson comorbidity index \u2265 2. Although the FRAX tool does not include a Charlson comorbidity index in its users\u2019 guide, this was chosen to include diseases with a known increased fracture risk [41] comparable to the clinical risk factor model. [3] Lumbar and thoracic spine BMD values show high correlations [20], but currently, only lumbar QCT BMD is recommended [43]. CT-measured thoracic BMD is a surrogate marker of fracture risk, currently not included in clinical guidelines to diagnose osteoporosis [20, 43]. Despite BMD being the strongest individual predictor of fracture risk, the developed models\u2019 ability to predict future fractures needs to be assessed. In the lack of validated thoracic BMD cutoff values, we chose ACR\u2019s recommended lumbar spine BMD cutoff values for very low and low BMD. This likely underestimates the very low and low BMD group due to physiological differences in BMD values between the thoracic and lumbar spine [44]. [4] In the lack of relevant clinical cutoff values, predefined cutoff values of 6%, 12%, and 24% were chosen according to the calculated p/2, p, and 2p as described by Cook et\u00a0al. (2011) [30]. The results of the reclassification analyses were dependent on these cutoff values.\nWe performed cross-validation, as model synthesis tested in the original dataset tends to optimistic estimate the predictive performance [45]. Our analysis showed a more realistic estimate with the tendency of a slight over-fitting, however not affecting the overall results. As our models were developed and assessed in the same study population, there is a need to externally validate the results of this study in an independent cohort to fully assess the generalizability of the results.\nIn conclusion, adding a GS to a clinical risk factor model did not improve the overall prediction of very low BMD. However, we noticed that the GS performed equally or above individual risk factors in discrimination. Clinical risk factors\n1 3\ncombined showed superior discrimination to individual risk factors and the GS, underlining the value of combined CRFs in routine clinics as a stratification tool.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s00198- 023- 06857-w.\nAcknowledgements The authors are grateful for all the priceless and valuable work done by the clinical staff involved in the Dan-NICAD trial.
