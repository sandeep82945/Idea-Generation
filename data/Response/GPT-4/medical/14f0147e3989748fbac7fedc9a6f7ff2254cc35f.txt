Longitudinal Study on Vitamin B6 Levels and DP Treatment Phases: Conduct a longitudinal study to monitor vitamin B6 levels in Wilson's Disease (WD) patients from the initiation of D-penicillamine (DP) treatment through various phases of the disease. This study would help to understand the dynamics of vitamin B6 levels over time and across different stages of WD, especially in the initial phases of treatment where the study suggests results might not be extrapolable.

Prospective Study on Dietary Intake and Vitamin B6 Levels in WD Patients: Initiate a prospective study that evaluates the role of dietary intake on vitamin B6 levels in WD patients treated with DP. This study should include a detailed dietary evaluation to assess if a regular diet can provide sufficient vitamin B6 to counteract the antipyridoxine effect of DP, and identify specific conditions or patient profiles (e.g., malnutrition, growth spurts in children) where supplementation might be more critical.

Clinical Trials on Vitamin B6 Supplementation Dosage and Frequency: Design and conduct clinical trials to determine the optimal dosage and frequency of vitamin B6 supplementation for WD patients on DP treatment. This could help establish a consensus on supplementation practices, balancing the benefits of preventing deficiency against the risks of overdose, especially given the ubiquity of vitamin B6 in common foods.

Study on the Impact of Vitamin B6 Supplementation on DP Side Effects and Treatment Adherence: Investigate the impact of vitamin B6 supplementation on the adverse effects associated with DP treatment and overall treatment adherence. Since DP can cause significant side effects leading to discontinuation, understanding how vitamin B6 supplementation interacts with these effects could inform better management strategies for WD.

Electrophysiology Studies on Neurological Manifestations in Supplemented vs. Non-Supplemented Groups: Perform dedicated electrophysiology studies to assess neurological manifestations in WD patients treated with DP, comparing those with and without vitamin B6 supplementation. This research would specifically look for subtle signs of neuropathy or other neurological conditions that might be attributable to either vitamin B6 deficiency or overdose, addressing a gap noted in the current study regarding the clinical neurological examination's sensitivity.
