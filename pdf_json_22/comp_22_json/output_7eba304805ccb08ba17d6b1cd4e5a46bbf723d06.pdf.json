    "abstractText": "This study deals with the mathematical modeling, dynamic analysis, hybrid control structure, and experimental tests of a hydraulic servo drive (HSD) flexibly connected by a vibration isolator as a spring damping device (SDD) to a boom manipulator excited by the cyclic impact force generated by a rock breaker. Based on the dynamic model of the HSD-SDD system, the frequency ratios of the rigid and flexible connections to the mass load were determined. The HSD-SDD model was saved as a Hammerstein model with unknown parameters. The dynamic linear part of the HSD-SDDmodel was adopted as an autoregressive model with an exogenous input (ARX) model. The online proportional integral derivative (PID) controller parameter-tuning algorithm was implemented in several steps. The PID controller tuning process occurs in real time, and the optimal setting of the PID controller depends on the critical ultimate gain and period set at the stability limit. A hybrid control structure consisting of a feedback controller and feedforward controller was proposed. A combination of input shaping and feedforward filters is used, thus the badly damped vibrations are more effectively compensated, resulting in better control accuracy of the HSD-SDD system. The goal of optimizing the hybrid control structure is to determine a feedforward filter coefficient that minimizes the objective function. Finally, the global minimum is calculated from the control error based on the measurement of the input and output signals. The highlight of this study is the development of a new hybrid control structure to compensate for badly damped vibrations.

INTRODUCTION The dynamic properties and precision of hydraulic servo drive (HSD) control depend on the rigidity of the mounting of its components: actuators (barrel and piston rod), control elements (valves), load mass, and equipment. Although the connections between the hydraulic and mechanical components in hydraulic drives are flexible, they are assumed rigid. It is also necessary to consider clearances in moving joints. The assumptions of rigid connections can be applied to vehicles on rough roads, heavy vehicles, aircraft, construction equipment, road vehicles, road-makingmachines, heavyduty machines, agricultural machinery, mining machinery,\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Wonhee Kim .\nsteel industry machines, lifting equipment, transportation equipment, heavy manipulators and robots. The operating conditions of heavy hydraulic machines with changing load mass and external forces cause the formation of vibrations and deformation of the elastic structural elements and connecting devices of hydraulic systems. Vibrations and flow pulsations were also transmitted to the drive and control components of the hydraulic system. In justified cases, the influence of the non-rigid (flexible) mounting of hydraulic elements on the dynamic properties is considered. It is generally assumed that all hydraulic components are rigidly mounted and that the load mass is rigidly connected to the piston rod of the cylinder. Although this assumption is valid for most industrial applications, there are cases in which a non-rigid connection of a load mass should be considered.\n7734 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

This situation frequently arises in hydraulically actuated machines, such as rolling mills where the hydraulic actuator is fully integrated with the mill stand [1]. Helduser et al. presented the use of hydraulic actuators in four basic versions, considering their non-rigid mounting [2]. The research paper reviewed non-rigid or flexible connections of hydraulic actuators. Cetinkunt presented a hydraulic control system with one degree of freedom, a flexible base and load contact [3]. A single-acting hydraulic actuator connected to a non-rigid base and mass load was considered. In this case, using mobile work equipment, a hydraulic actuator is connected to the machine frame, and the machine frame rides on the flexible wheels. The piston rod end was connected to the mass load through a non-rigid tool mechanism. The interaction between the actuator and mass load was modeled as an inertia spring and damper system. Walters presented various dynamic performances of the linear model of a hydraulic actuator with an elastically mounted mass analyzed when the mass is inside or outside the feedback loop [4]. It has been established that the stiffness of a hydraulic actuator significantly affects the dynamic properties of the hydraulic drive. Feng et al. presented the impacts of various factors on the stiffness properties of the hydraulic actuator, including the modulus of the oil volume modulus, air content of the hydraulic oil, axial deformation of the piston rod, expansion of the barrel volume, expansion of the volume of metal pipes and flexible hoses, and deformation of the seal [5]. Tang and Ren presented spring-damper systems that were equivalent to the dynamic model of hydraulic actuators [6]. This actuator was used to lift the boom from a truck that delivered the concrete. Sochacki and Tomski presented actuator dynamic stability tests to determine the conditions of stability loss [7]. Hydraulic cylinder vibration models are generally adopted as beam models [8], [9], in which a vibration damping analysis is performed on beams that model a barrel and piston rod. Zhang and Zhang presented a method for vibration analysis of a hydraulic pump [10]. The dynamic responses of the hydraulic plunger pump were obtained through numerical simulations. Zhang et al. proposed a novel passive hydraulically interconnected suspension system to achieve improved compromise in the handling of mining vehicles [11]. A lumped-mass vehicle model with a coupled mechanical-hydraulic system was developed by applying the free-body diagram method. Robots for heavy loads and/or wide operating ranges with flexible links have become popular research objects for control engineers owing to their sophisticated properties [12]. The approach to active damping control for flexible multilink robots uses a spring damping element, which is a passive energy-dissipation device [13]. Rydberg demonstrated the weakness of elastic connections in the mounting of a cylinder and piston rod [14]. Hydraulic actuators fail because of physical damage or deterioration of their seals. Physical damage to a hydraulic actuator is usually\ncaused by an external source, such as vibrations excited by a rock breaker. Actuator damage can take the form of a bent piston rod or dented barrel, both of which can prevent a full piston stroke. Physical damage to actuator mounting parts can also occur. Because a hydraulic actuator is a single point of failure (SPOF), its reliability is essential in hydraulic actuation systems [15]. For safety reasons, hydraulic components must be mounted in a manner that is resistant to buckling owing to excitation vibration [16]. Wang presented a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of an aircraft hydraulic power supply and control system [17]. Military standards (MIL-STD) require compliance with good practices for the operation and maintenance of hydraulic systems and components [18]. Hydraulic drives are also used in the vibration test stands. The hydraulic vibrating stand contained a pressure pulsation generator created by the rotary piston of a hydraulic valve with a hydraulic motor and hydraulic cylinder for vibration loads [19]. Hydraulic vibration generators that implement periodic variable motion are used not only in test stands (e.g., vehicle body testbed and, pulse apparatus) but also in technological machines, mining machines, and agricultural and construction equipment. Gao et al. conducted experiments have been carried out to describe hydraulic pipeline systems in which the excitation of fluid pressure in a pipeline is driven by a throttle valve, and the base excitation is produced by a shaker driven by a vibration controller [20].\nThe contribution of this work in relation to the existing solutions consists of tuning the PID controller in real time and using the hybrid control structure to compensate for badly damped vibration. The optimal real-time PID tuning process depends on the critical ultimate gain and the critical ultimate period set at the stability limit. A hybrid control structure consisting of a feedback controller and feedforward controller was proposed. A combination of an input-shaping filter and a feedforward filter is used; thus, badly damped vibrations are more effectively compensated, resulting in better control accuracy of the HSD-SDD system. The goal of optimizing the hybrid control structure is to determine a feedforward filter coefficient that minimizes the objective function. Finally, the global minimum was calculated from the control error based on the measurement of the input and output signals. The simulation and experimental results of this research provide operational guidelines for designers of hydraulic manipulators working with long-term mechanical vibrations. Design difficulties arise when selecting an HSD-SDD system for the hydraulic manipulators of an industrial crusher.\nII. FORMULATING THE RESEARCH PROBLEM Vibrating mechanisms affect technical devices and machines, leading to failure or even damage to structural elements. Excess vibrations are a common problem during the operation of hydraulic drives. These are not due to hydraulic reasons, but to mechanical reasons resulting from excited vibrations. When designing hydraulic systems, the natural vibrations of the hydraulic components and externalmechanical vibrations are generally not considered, although this may\nVOLUME 10, 2022 7735\nbe justified. The mechanical connections and construction structures were assumed rigid and the external mass loads were constant. This implies that the effects of mechanical vibrations on the hydraulic components were not considered. However, designers of hydraulic equipment should anticipate the potential problems of long-term mechanical vibrations and should not be guided by simplified and short-term solutions that can lead to problems with the operation and maintenance of hydraulic components and systems.\nIn jaw crushers, rocks are crushed between the fixed and moving plates (jaws). Jaw crushers can easily crush rocks of any material or size. Crushers use different jaws with smooth adjustment of the grip angle using a special screw. Blake crushers are commonly used in the rock industry. In the cement industry, a crusher shreds limestone rocks into smaller ones, which are then transported to the mill and calcined into quicklime after milling and separation. During surgery, the jaw crusher, rock conveyor, feed gap, and jaw are often blocked by excessively large rock particles. For crushers without a manipulator, rocks that are too large must be crushed by a worker using a manual hammer under hazardous conditions. This contributes to the downtime of the jaw crusher and reduces productivity. The hydraulic manipulator has a working space that allows the crushing of excessively large stones in the jaw crusher, on the conveyor, in the feed gap, or between the jaws. Hydraulic manipulators contribute to the reduction in downtime caused by material blockage in the jaw crusher. They also significantly improved the safety of crusher operations. Mechanical vibrations from the rock breaker to the crusher manipulator and the components of the hydraulic system were transmitted. It contributes significantly to the troubleshooting and maintenance of hydraulic components and systems. The designer of the crusher manipulator and hydraulic system should anticipate the operational problems related to long-term mechanical vibrations. However, the most common practice is to determine simple design solutions that provide only short-term operational benefits. Rock breakers mounted on hydraulic manipulator break large rocks in the jaw crusher space. Crusher users have reported problems with the operation of hydraulic manipulators. This is related to the mechanical connecting elements and hydraulic components. The design of the hydraulic manipulators used in rock crushers is difficult to modify. It was proposed to constructors of hydraulic manipulators to introduce an elastic connection with damping as a vibro-isolator to reduce the transmission of vibrations from the excitation source (rock breaker) to the HSD. As a result of the cooperation of the authors with the designers of hydraulic manipulators and jaw crusher users in the production of rock aggregates in a cement plant, it was necessary to evaluate the dynamic properties and control system of the HSD that is flexible with the load mass induced by the cyclic force [21].\nFig. 1 shows the model of a Blake jaw crusher with a rock conveyor andmounted hydraulic boommanipulator. A design solution for a hydraulic manipulator for jaw crushers was proposed to crush rocks with an average weight up to 300 kg.\nThe hydraulic manipulator has three degrees of freedom (3DoF), and its workspace includes the rock conveyor, feed gap, and jaws. The double telescopic boom consists of a mother boom and internal boom. The mother boom was lifted and rotated by hydraulic cylinders. The inner boomwas extended and retracted by the hydraulic cylinder of an HSD, which was the subject of the tests. In the proposed design solution, the hydraulic cylinder was rigidly mounted on the mother boom, and the piston rod was flexibly connected to the inner boom via the SDD vibration isolator. The SDD is a spring device with viscoelastic damping elements that enables effective damping of vibrations under high dynamic loads in hydraulic rock breakers. The SDD parameters were adopted from the following ranges: damping coefficient dm = 10 - 25 kNs/m and spring stiffness coefficient km = 10 - 100 kN/m. The hydraulic rock breaker was mounted on an internal telescopic boom that was extended by a hydraulic cylinder to a length of 1.2 m. The selected hydraulic rock breaker (SC25 Montabert) had the following parameters: weight of 225 kg, working pressure of 120 bar, flow range of 25-50 L/min, frequency of 1,310 bpm, and tool diameter of 0.055 m. A quantitative estimate of the impact\n7736 VOLUME 10, 2022\nloads on a hydraulic rock breaker is necessary. The striking forces and vibration frequencies were determined via impact experiments. The use of a hydraulic rock breaker increases the crushing capacity on a Blake jaw crusher by an average of 20%.\nElectrohydraulic servo systems are normally integrated units in an assembly, which is specified as an HSD [22]. The HSD consists of a differential hydraulic actuator (cylinder), a proportional directional control valve 4/3 (4-way, 3-position) with electrical position feedback, and integrated control electronics (ICE) called on-board electronics (OBE). The ICE compares the specified command value with the actual position value of the main-valve control spool. Placing a proportional directional control valve with a position controller directly on the hydraulic actuator reduced the volume of oil and improved the dynamic properties of the HSD. When the control valve is to be operated, a positive or negative 0-10 V command signal is used. A positive voltage shifts the spool to position A and a negative voltage shifts the spool to position B. The hydraulic actuator parameters are the diameter of the piston D = 0.05 m, the diameter of the piston rod d = 0.028 m, area ratio \u03b1 = 0.69, stroke h = 1.25 m, and working pressure p = 25 MPa. Technical data of the 4WRSE proportional control valve: nominal volumetric flow rate qvn = 35 L/min (0.583 10\n\u22123 m3s\u22121) at a pressure difference of 1pn = 1 MPa, power supply of 24VDC, command value u = \u00b1 10 V, and mineral oil HLP46 (kinematic viscosity \u03bd = 0.46 10\u22124 m2s\u22121 at temperature T = 313.15 K). The hydraulic actuator contained an internal magnetostrictive linear-position transducer.\nIII. DYNAMIC MODEL OF THE HSD-SDD SYSTEM The complex two degrees of freedom (2DoF) nonlinear dynamic model of the HSD-SDD system was described by differential equations in a semiexplicit manner. Figure 2 shows the computational model of an HSD flexibly connected to the load mass through an SDD.\nThe following state coordinates were assumed in the HSD dynamic model:\n\u2013 displacement x, velocity vx = dx/dt , and acceleration ax = d2x/dt2 of the mass load\n\u2013 displacement y, velocity vy = dy/dt , and acceleration ay = d2y/dt2 of the actuator piston \u2013 shift z and velocity vz = dz/dt of the control valve spool, the spool shift z is related to the command signal u by the first-order inertial PT1 element\nTz z\u0307+ z = Kz u\u21d2 z\u0307 = \u2212 1 Tz z+ Kz Tz u, (1)\nwhere Tz is the time constant and Kz is the gain factor of the proportional directional valve [23].\n\u2013 pressure p and pressure impulse (pressure\u2013time derivative) pi = dp/dt in actuator chambers. Because a dynamic system with two degrees of freedom was considered, the coordinate differences 1x = x \u2212 y, 1y = y \u2212 x for the dynamic equations were introduced. Finally, the 2DoF dynamic model for an HSD flexibly connected to a mass load is expressed as follows: x\u0308 = 1 mL [\u2212dm 1x\u0307 \u2212 km 1x \u2212 FC + F(t)] y\u0308 = 1 my [ \u2212dm 1y\u0307\u2212 km 1y\u2212 Ff + FL ] z\u0307 = \u2212 1 Tz z+ Kz Tz u p\u03071 = 1 C1 [qv1 \u2212 A1 1y\u0307\u2212 kl (p1 \u2212 p2)]\np\u03072 = 1 C2 [\u2212qv2 + A2 1y\u0307+ kl (p1 \u2212 p2)\u2212 kle p2] ,\n(2)\nwhere mL is the load mass; dm is the damping coefficient; km is the spring stiffness coefficient; FC is the Coulomb friction force; my is the moving mass of the actuator; A1 and A2 are the effective areas of the actuator piston; kl is the internal leakage flow coefficient between the cylinder chambers; and kle is the internal leakage flow coefficient in the cylinder piston rod chamber. F(t) is the excitation force limited to the harmonic vibration\nF(t) = F0 + FI sin (2 \u03c0 fe t) , (3)\nwhere F0 is a constant component of the force, FI is the impact force, and fe is the excitation frequency. FL is the load force of the hydraulic actuator\nFL = A1 p1 \u2212 A2 p2 = A1 (p1 \u2212 \u03b1 p2) = A1 pL , (4)\nwhere \u03b1 is the area ratio, \u03b1 = A1/A2, pL is the load pressure\npL = FL A1 = p1 \u2212 \u03b1 p2, (5)\nFf is the friction force as a function of the velocity of the piston\nFf = dy y\u0307+ F st exp \u2212\u03c3 |y\u0307(t)| sign (y\u0307(t))+ FS , (6)\nwhere dy is the viscous friction coefficient, Fst is the static friction force, and \u03c3 is a variable coefficient. The total friction force FS in the hydraulic actuator seal is the sum of the friction force Fl due to the squeeze of the seal\nVOLUME 10, 2022 7737\nand the friction force Fa due to the hydraulic pressure on the seal [24]:\nFS = Fl + Fa = fl L + fa A, (7)\nwhere fl is the friction force per contact length of the seal; L is the circumference of the piston groove seal (L = \u03c0Do); Do is the piston groove outer diameter; fa is the friction force per projected area of the seal; A is the projected area of the seal in the piston groove (A = \u03c0 /4 (D2o-d 2 i ); and di is the piston groove. C1 and C2 are the hydraulic capacities of the actuator chambers at initial position y0 of the actuator piston\nC1 = V1 K = V10 + A1 (y0 + y) K , (8) C2 = V2 K = V20 + A2 (h\u2212 (y0 + y)) K , (9)\nwhere K is the bulk modulus; V10 and V20 are the dead volumes of the cylinder chamber; and h is the stroke of the actuator piston. qv1 and qv1 are the flow rates through the proportional valve of the proportional directional servo valve 4/3 (A + A, spool overlap \u00b13%)\nqv1 = Kq (zo + z) \u221a\u2223\u22231p1\u2223\u2223 sign (1p1) , (10)\n1p1 = { ps \u2212 p1, y \u2265 0 p1 \u2212 pT , y < 0,\n(11)\nqv2 = Kq (z0 \u2212 z) \u221a\u2223\u22231p2\u2223\u2223 sign (1p2) , (12)\n1p2 = { ps \u2212 p2, y < 0 p2 \u2212 pT , y \u2265 0,\n(13)\nwhere ps is the supply pressure, pT is the tank pressure, z0 is the spool of the underlap valve, and Kq is the flow coefficient of the control valve\nKq = qvn zn \u221a 1pn , (14)\nwhere qvn is the nominal flow rate at a pressure drop1pn = 1 MPa and zn is the nominal shift of the servo-valve spool.\nThe inclusion of the SDD increases the degree of freedom of the dynamic HSD model, which complicates its simulation and analysis. The proposed nonlinear dynamic model was used to evaluate the dynamic properties of an HSD for a rigidly and elastically connected load mass excited by an external cyclic force. The dynamic model, written in the form of explicit differential equations, is used for the numerical calculations performed by the user in a simulation software such as MATLAB\u2013Simulink. Dynamic model (2) was expressed as a nonlinear state-space model\n(seventh order differential equation). x\u03071 = x2 x\u03072 = 1 mL [\u2212dm (x2 \u2212 x4)\u2212 km (x1 \u2212 x3)] \u2212 1 mL FC + 1 mL F(t) x\u03073 = x4 x\u03074 = 1 my [ \u2212 dm (x4 \u2212 x2)\u2212 dy x4 \u2212 km (x3 \u2212 x1) +A1p6 \u2212 \u03b1A1p7 ] +\u2212 1 my Ff (x4) x\u03075 = \u2212 1 Tz x5 + Kz Tz u x\u03076 = 1 C1 [\u2212A1 (x4 \u2212 x2)\u2212 kl (x6 \u2212 x7)] + 1 C1 qv1(x5, x6, x7) x\u03077 = 1 C2 [A2 (x4 \u2212 x2)+ kl (x6 \u2212 x7)\u2212 kle x7]\n\u2212 1 C2 qv2(x5, x6, x7)\n(15)\nwhere: x1 = x, x2 = vx , x3 = y, x4 = vy, x5 = z, x6 = p1, x7 = p2. The dynamic model (15) is a complex nonlinear dynamic system that includes the insensitivity and saturation of the control valve, the square pressure drop, and the friction force based on the Striebeck model. Most proportional control valves have undesirably high nonlinearity, asymmetric flow gain, and hysteresis. Nonlinear external disturbances such as the Coulomb friction force and external cyclic force significantly influence the dynamic responses of the HSD-SDD system. The nonlinear behavior of the HSD-SDD system may vary with changes in the system load and operating\nTABLE 1. Main constant parameters of the HSD model.\n7738 VOLUME 10, 2022\nconditions. The values of the main constant parameters of the HSD-SDD dynamic model are listed in Table 1.\nIV. SELECTION OF THE HSD-SDD SYSTEM The first step in selecting an HSD-SDD system is to determine the frequency ratios for the case of a rigid and flexible load-mass connection.\nA. RIGIDLY CONNECTED LOAD MASS The excitation frequency fe is derived from the rock breaker frequency\nfe = frb 60 , (16)\nwhere frb is the frequency of the rock breaker in beats per minute (bpm).\nThis equation follows fe = 1,310/60 = 21.8 Hz. The natural frequency fy of the actuator excited by the\ncyclic load is\nfy = 1 2 \u03c0\n\u221a ky\nmy + mL . (17)\nThe hydraulic oil in the actuator chamber is compressible and thus acts as a stiff spring. The spring stiffness ky(y) of the asymmetric actuator resulting from the oil volume elasticity in the series-connected cylinder chambers is\nky(y) = ( A21 C1 + A22 C2 ) = K ( A21 V1 + A22 V2 )\n= K\n( A21\nV10 + A1 y + A22 V20 + A2 (h\u2212 y)\n) . (18)\nThe frequency ratio fr for a rigid connection is as follows\nfr = fe fy . (19)\nFigure 3 shows the natural frequency fy of the asymmetric hydraulic actuator versus the displacement of piston y over stroke length h, where fr is defined as the ratio of the excitation frequency fe to the natural frequency fy of a hydraulic actuator.\nThe lowest value of the natural frequency of the hydraulic actuator is fy \u2248 30 Hz. The relative frequency fr versus piston displacement y for the asymmetric hydraulic actuator excited by the cyclic load is shown in Fig. 4. A rock breaker is selected to avoid resonant vibrations when the excitation frequency fe is close to the natural frequency fy of the actuator (fr \u2248 1).\nThe dynamic properties of the HSD depend on the ratio of the actuator frequency fy to the proportional servo-valve frequency fz\nfd = fy fz . (20)\nIn this study, a 4WRES proportional valve (Bosch Rexroth) was used to control the direction and size of the\nvolumetric flow. It is a high-response valve with a frequency of fz = 100 Hz and a phase shift of 90\u25e6. For fd = 0.3-0.6, the best results are obtained for the state-space controller. This type of controller is used in machines that require highly dynamic operation [25].\nB. FLEXIBLE-CONNECTED LOAD MASS The natural frequency fy of the actuator\nfy = 1 2 \u03c0 \u221a ky my . (21)\nThe natural frequency fm of the mechanical components of the SDD\nfm = 1 2 \u03c0 \u221a km mL . (22)\nThe frequency ratios frym and frem for a flexible connection are as follows\nfrym = fy fm , (23) frem = fe fm . (24)\nVOLUME 10, 2022 7739\nThe damping ratio \u03bey of the actuator\n\u03bey = dy 2 \u221a ky my . (25)\nThe damping ratio \u03bem of mechanical components of the SDD\n\u03bem = dm\n2 \u221a km mL\n. (26)\nThe relative damping rdmy for a flexible connection is as follows\nrdmy = \u03bem \u03bey = dm dy \u221a ky km \u221a my mL . (27)\nFor the assumed setting of the piston stroke, the yset frequency ratios were frym = 95.01, frem = 9.7, and the relative damping was rdmy = 11.4.\nV. PULSATION OF PRESSURE IN A SHORT HYDRAULIC LINE The variation in the flow caused by the actuator excitation process leads to flow fluctuations in the hydraulic pipeline. Excess pressure pulsation amplitudes can cause mechanical vibrations and fatigue failures in hydraulic pipelines and connecting elements. The influence of the pressure pulsation in the cylinder on the flow fluctuation was modeled in a short hydraulic line with lumped parameters.\nTo set the yset of the piston stroke, a mechanical model of an actuator excited by cyclic force was developed. y\u0308 = 1 my + mL [ \u2212dy y\u0307\u2212 (A1 p1 \u2212 A2 p2)+ F(t) ] p\u03071 = 1 C1set A1 y\u0307 = ( K V10 + A1 yset ) A1 y\u0307 p\u03072 = \u2212 1\nC2set A2 y\u0307 = \u2212\n( K\nV20 + A2 (h\u2212yset)\n) A2 y\u0307. (28)\nFor the assumed setting of the piston stroke yset , the displacement y(t) and the speed vy(t) of an actuator rigidly connected to a loadmassmL = 250 kg fo ryset = 0.6m and the excitation force F(t) at the frequency fe = 21.8 Hz are shown in Fig. 5. For such a piston stroke setting, the pulsation of pressures p1(t) and p2(t) in an actuator rigidly connected to a load mass mL = 250 kg for yset = 0.6 m and the excitation force F(t) at the frequency fe = 21.8 Hz are shown in Fig. 6. In the analyzed case, the frequency of pressure pulsation in the actuator is fp1 = 1/T = 10 Hz, where T is the time period of pressure pulsation, T \u223c= 0.1 s.\nHydraulic short lines can be modeled using lumped circuit elements in the form of resistance, inductance, and capacitance (RLC). A model of a short hydraulic line connecting the actuator and control valve was considered (Fig. 7).\nThe one-dimensional RhLhCh model of a short cylindrical hydraulic line with lumped parameters, as shown schematically in Fig. 7, can be expressed using the following differential equation:\n1 Ch\n\u222b qh dt + Lh\ndqh dt + Rh qh = p1 \u2212 ph, (29)\nwhere qh is the pipe flow rate; p1 is the pressure at the inlet of the pipe; ph is the pressure at the outlet of the pipe; Ch is the hydraulic line capacitance, Ch = V/K ; Lh is the hydraulic line inductance, Lh = \u03c1a/A; Rh is the hydraulic line resistance, Rh = (8\u03c0 l\u03b7)/A2; a is the velocity of the sound, a = \u221a K/\u03c1; V is the volume of the cylinder chamber\n7740 VOLUME 10, 2022\nand pipeline; A is the pipe cross-section, A = \u03c0r2; r is the pipe inner diameter; l is the pipe length; K is the bulk modulus; \u03c1 and is the density of the oil. There is a valve at the end of a short hydraulic line for which the flow rate is qh = \u221a ph Rv\n, where Rv is the flow resistance through the valve at the nominal flow rate qn and nominal pressure drop 1pn, and Rv = \u221a 1pn qn .\nEq. (29) is written as a transition function in the Laplace domain solution\nGp(s) = qh(s) p1(s) = Ch s Ch Lh s2 + Ch Rh s+ 1\n= Ch s\n1 \u03c92h s2 + 2 \u03b6 \u03c9h s+ 1\n, (30)\nwhere \u03c9h is the natural frequency of the hydraulic line \u03c9h =\n1 \u221a Ch Lh ,\n\u03b6 is the damping coefficient of hydraulic line \u03b6 = 1 2 Ch Rh \u03c9h. The frequency-domain transfer function was defined as the ratio of the output pressure amplitude to the input pressure amplitude\nGp(j\u03c9) = ph(j\u03c9) p1(j\u03c9) = Rv Ch j \u03c9 1\u2212 \u03c9 2\n\u03c9h2 + 2 \u03c2 \u03c9h j\u03c9\n= 1 \u03b1 [ \u03b2 + j ( \u03c9 \u03c9h \u2212 \u03c9h \u03c9 )] , (31) where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the constant coefficients of the short hydraulic line, \u03b1 = 1Rv Ch \u03c9h , and \u03b2 = 2 \u03b6 , respectively.\nUltimately, the amplitude of the transition function (31) was determined\u2223\u2223Gp(j\u03c9)\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223ph(j\u03c9)p1(j\u03c9) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = 1 \u03b1 \u221a \u03b22 + ( \u03c9 \u03c9h \u2212 \u03c9h \u03c9\n)2 . (32) Basic parameters of the short hydraulic pipeline model: V = 0.1 m3, r = 0.005 m, l = 0.2 m. However, for the short pipeline, the frequency fh = \u03c9h/2 \u03c0 = 0.5 Hz was calculated. For these parameters, Fig. 8 shows the resonance characteristics of the short hydraulic line for different flow rates in the control, and Fig. 9 shows the frequency response of the short hydraulic line.\nThe presented analysis shows that the pressure pulsations in the actuator are transferred to the flow fluctuations in a short pipeline. The resonance characteristics in Fig. 8 show the maximum vibration amplitudes for a pressure pulsation frequency that is equal to the natural frequency of the short hydraulic line (fp1/fh = 1). Vibration resonance must be avoided because the maximum pressure pulsations that arise can seriously damage the hydraulic system and significantly shorten its life. In the case of near-resonance vibrations, a pulsation damper should be used in the hydraulic lines.\nVI. SIMULATION RESULTS The industrial use of the HSD was considered, in which the cylinder was rigidly mounted on the main boom and the piston rod was flexibly connected via an SDD to the inner boom of a hydraulic crusher manipulator. The purpose of the simulation tests is to assess the dynamic properties of an HSD that is rigidly and flexibly connected to a load mass excited by a cyclic force. The step response of an HSD rigidly and flexibly connected to a load mass at a constant force or the cyclic force generated by the rock breaker was compared. The HSD-SDD simulation model in MATLAB Simulink using Simscape FluidsTM tools is illustrated in Fig. 10.\nA. THE INITIAL-STATE PARAMETERS The initial pressures in the cylinder chamber were established in the steady state of HSD for x = 0, vx = 0, y = 0, vy = 0, z = 0, and vz = 0. For the steady state, the flow rate through the proportional directional spool valve can be written as q1 = A1 z\u0307 = Kq1 z0 \u221a ps \u2212 p10 q2 = \u03b1A1 z\u0307 = Kq2 z0 \u221a p20\npL = p10 \u2212 \u03b1 p20\n(33)\nVOLUME 10, 2022 7741\nFor 1p2 = ps \u2013 p10, 1p2 = p20, pT = 0 and using m = Kq2/Kq1 = 0.5 and \u03b1 = q2/q1 = 0.68 the initial pressures p10 and p20 in the cylinder were determined as follows\np10 = \u03b13 p0 + m2pL m2 + \u03b13 , p20 = \u03b12 (p0 \u2212 pL) m2 + \u03b13 . (34)\nB. DYNAMIC RESPONSE The dynamic responses of the displacements y(t) and the speeds vy(t) of an HSD actuator rigidly connected to a load mass mL = 250 kg for yset = 0.6 m, a constant force F0 = 2500N, and the excitation force F(t) at frequency fe = 21.8 Hz are compared in Fig. 11. The dynamic responses of the load pressure pL(t) in an HSD actuator rigidly connected to a load mass mL = 250 kg for yset = 0.6m, a constant force F0 = 2500 N (blue line), and the excitation force F(t) (red line) at frequency fe = 21.8 Hz are compared in Fig. 12. The opening characteristics of the proportional directional valve for the time constant Tz = 0.01 s (100 Hz) and the factor gain Kz = 1.66 10\u22124 m/V are shown in Fig. 13. Figs. 11, 12, and 13 show that, in hydraulic circuits, the dynamic characteristics of the hydraulic cylinder and control valve are of great importance. Upon sudden switching of the valve and cutoff of the flow to the cylinder chamber, rapid\nhydraulic pulsation develops, causing significant noise. In the case of fast movements during the vibration of the hydraulic cylinder piston, the position output signals from the magnetostrictive transducer make accurate measurements difficult. This affects the switching disturbance of the control valve. Forced vibrations intensify disturbances in the operation and control of the hydraulic systems.\n7742 VOLUME 10, 2022\nThe dynamic responses of displacement y(t) and speed vy(t) of an HSD actuator flexibly connected by SDD to a load mass mL = 250 kg for yset = 0.6 m, constant force F0 = 2500 N and excitation force F(t) at frequency fe = 21.8 Hz are compared in Fig. 14.\nThe dynamic responses of the load pressure pL(t) in an HSD actuator flexibly connected by SDD to a load mass mL = 250 kg for yset = 0.6m, a constant force F0 = 2500 N and the excitation force F(t) at frequency fe = 21.8 Hz are compared in Fig. 15.\nThe dynamic responses of the displacements y(t) and the speeds vy(t) of an HSD actuator rigidly and flexibly connected by SDD to a load mass mL = 250 kg foryset = 0.6 m and the excitation force F(t) at frequency fe = 21.8 Hz are compared in Fig. 16.\nThe dynamic responses of the load pressure pL(t) of an HSD actuator rigidly and flexibly connected by SDD to a load mass mL = 250 kg for yset = 0.6m and the excitation force F(t) at frequency fe = 21.8 Hz are compared in Fig. 17.\nA comparison of the HSD step response (Figs.14-17) shows a difference in the dynamic properties for a rigid and flexible connection between a load mass at a constant force and the cyclic force generated by the rock breaker. The simulation results were used to select the SDD and vibration exciter for the test stand.\nVOLUME 10, 2022 7743\nKnowledge of the influence of mechanical vibrations on the dynamic behavior of hydraulic systems is of key importance in the engineering design of products such as crusher manipulators, as well as in the selection of hydraulic components with the required dynamic properties. When designing, it must be considered that vibration phenomena have an impact on the increase in noise in hydraulic circuits and the reduction in the service life of hydraulic components. In the case of fast movements during the vibration of the hydraulic cylinder piston, the position output signals from the magnetostrictive transducer make accurate measurements difficult. This causes disturbances in the control-valve-switching time. Forced vibrations intensify the disturbances and natural vibrations of the cylinder and the hydraulic valve. Vibrations in a hydraulic system can cause failure or destruction of hydraulic components. Owing to the use of the SDD, the amplitude and frequency of vibrations in the HSD decreased.\nThe sensitivity of the HSD-SDD system to deformations of the manipulator structure and actuator mounting was not analyzed. The simulation of the HSD-SDD includes an analysis of the sensitivity of hydraulic control systems to changes in the internal and external parameters. A sensitivity analysis was performed at the design stage during the simulation tests using the sensitivity function in the Laplace domain. The HSD-SDD is a dynamic system, the output signals of which show periodic vibrations described by a harmonic function. For such a system, the logarithmic sensitivity function is the most appropriate measure of changes in the amplitude characteristics with disturbed parameters.\nVII. EXPERIMENTAL TEST STAND The experimental test aims to select an HSD control system that is flexibly connected to the load mass, ensuring accurate extension of the internal telescopic boom at the cyclic excitation force (impact force). A view of the HSD test stand is shown in Fig. 18.\nThe mass load of the hydraulic actuator as the technological payload was achieved using weights installed on the\nlinear guide support. A hydraulic loading actuator is used to generate a constant force on the actuator. An electrohydraulic vibration exciter with two rotary valves was used to generate an excitation force. The displacements of the hydraulic actuator (CSM1/MT4/50/28/1200) were measured using a Novostrictive R\u00a9 magnetostrictive linear position sensor TMI 0250 with a CANopen interface. The 4/3 proportional directional valve (4WRSE6V1-35-3X/G24K0/A1) was used for position and speed control of the hydraulic actuator. The technological load on the test stand was measured using a force sensor [25]. The supply pressure (pmax = 24 MPa) was set using a proportional pressure-relieving valve (DBETX\u20131X/250G24\u201325NZ4M). The test stand also included a computer system for a superior control system equipped with MATLAB/Simulink xPC Target software. The PC had C/A and A/C converter cards from the PCI-type DAS1602/16 Measurement Computing Corporation. A card with an actuator position converter is used to create the measurement system. In the experimental test, the measured signals were taken from the sensors as continuous signals, and then after discretization of the signal, the signal was recorded digitally.\nVIII. CONTROL SYSTEM DESIGN A. PARAMTERIC IDENTIFICATION OF THE HAMMERSTEIN MODEL OF THE HSD-SDD SYSTEM The HSD-SDD model is considered to be a discrete-time single-input and single-output (SISO) nonlinear system. The identification of unknown parameters in the nonlinear dynamic model of an HSD-SDD is difficult because of the need to measure the internal physical state. When a system\u2019s HSD-SDD output depends nonlinearly on its input, the I/O relationship can be decomposed into two or more series-connected components. In this case, the Hammerstein model, which shows a series connection of static nonlinear parts with a dynamic linear part, was used. A block diagram of the parametric identification of the Hammerstein model (H-model) of the HSD-SDD system is shown in Fig. 19.\n7744 VOLUME 10, 2022\nThe HSD-SDD dynamic model (15) is written in the form of a nonlinear state-space model:{\nx\u0307(t) = A x(t)+ N [x(t), u(t)] y(t) = C x(t)\n(35)\nwhere <x(t) \u2208 n is the state vector, <u(t) \u2208 m is the input vector, <y(t) \u2208 p is the output vector, <A \u2208 n+n is a linear matrix,<N \u2208 n+m is a nonlinear matrix,<C \u2208 p+n is a linear matrix.\nThe HSD model (35) was transformed into a discrete state space-time model with the separation of a linear transfer function G(z\u22121) and a nonlinear function f (u(k)){\nx(k) = f (u(k)) y(k) = G ( z\u22121 ) x(k)+ \u03b6 (k),\n(36)\nwith constraints\numin \u2264 u(k) \u2264 umax , ymin \u2264 y(k) \u2264 ymax ,\nwhere umin and ymin are vectors of the lower bounds, umax and ymax are vectors of the upper bounds, \u03b6 (k) is the additive noise, and z\u22121 is the discrete-time-domain backward-shift operator.\nThe HSD-SDD model (36) was saved as the Hammerstein model with unknown parameters consisting of two parts: a static nonlinear part and a dynamic linear part, and u(k), x(k), \u03b6 (k), and y(k) are the identification input, intermediate state, noise sequence, and output of the system [26], [27].\nThe static nonlinear subsystem is approximated by the set polynomial degree, and is described by the nonlinear function of the nth order that binds the nonlinear output x(k) to the input u(k): x(k) = m\u2211 k=1 fk uk (k) = f1 u(1)+ f2 u2(2)+ . . .+ fm um(m),\n(37)\nwhere fk is the nonlinearity parameter and m is the order of the polynomial.\nIn the dynamic linear part, the autoregressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX) model was applied, and the relation of input x(k) to output y(k) is as follows [28]:\ny(k) = G(z\u22121) x(k)+ \u03b6 (k) = z\u2212d B ( z\u22121 ) A ( z\u22121 )x(k)+ w(k) A ( z\u22121\n) , (38)\nwhere d is the discrete delay of the dynamic linear part, z\u22121 is the backward shift operator in the discrete-time domain A(z\u22121), andB(z\u22121) are the polynomials of an identifiedmodel of the controlled HSD, defined by A ( z\u22121 ) = 1+ na\u2211 i=1 ai z\u2212i = 1+ a1z\u22121 + a2z\u22122 + . . .+ anaz\u2212na B ( z\u22121 ) = nb\u2211 i=1 bi z\u2212i\n= b1z\u22121 + b2z\u22122 + . . .+ bnbz\u2212nb,\n(39)\nw(k) is the noise sequence w(k) = A ( z\u22121 ) \u03b6 (k). (40)\nWhen designing an ARX model, Equation (38) can be written in the following regression form:\ny(k) = \u2212 na\u2211 i=1 ai y(k \u2212 i)+ nb\u2211 i=1 bi x(k \u2212 i)+ w(k). (41)\nThe identification of unknown parameters in the HSD-SDD dynamic model is difficult owing to the need to measure the internal physical state. The estimation parameters ai and bi for the ARX model are shown in Fig. 20. The measured output of the HSD-SDD plant is given by the general expression:\nym(k) = y(k)+ e(k), (42)\nwhere e(k) is the output noise disturbance. Substituting (37) into (41) and then into (42), we obtain the following expression: ym(k) = \u2212 na\u2211 i=1 ai y(k \u2212 i)\n+ nb\u2211 i=1 bi m\u2211 k=1 fk uk (k \u2212 i)+ w(k)+ e(k). (43)\nEq. (43) can be written in the following least squares (LS) format\nym(k) = \u03b8T (k) \u03c6 + w(k)+ e(k), (44)\nwhere \u03b8T is the autoregressive variable\n\u03b8T (k) = [\u2212y(k \u2212 1), . . . ,\u2212y(k \u2212 na), u(k \u2212 1), . . . , um(k \u2212 na) ] , (45)\nVOLUME 10, 2022 7745\nwhere \u03d5 is the estimated parameter vector\n\u03c6 = [a1, . . . , ana, b1 f1, . . . , bnb fm]T . (46)\nThe estimated value of \u03d5 was obtained using the least squares method (LSM).\n\u03c6\u0302 = ( 8T 8 )\u22121 8T Y, (47)\nwhere \u03c6\u0302 = [ a\u03021, . . . , a\u0302na, b\u03021 f\u03021, . . . , b\u0302nb f\u0302m ]T ,8 =[\n\u03b8T (1), \u03b8T (2), . . . , \u03b8T (N ) ] , Y = [y(1), y(2), . . . , y(N )]T .\nThe parameters of the HDS-SDD model are estimated using the recursive least squares (RLS) method, which is based on minimizing the quality index.\n\u03c6\u0302 = argmin \u03b8 n\u2211 k=1 [ ym(k)\u2212 8\u0302(k)T\u03c6 ]2 . (48)\nExamples of the estimated parameters of the nonlinear HSDSDD model for a third-order polynomial function are shown in Fig. 21.\nB. PID CONTROLLER TUNING The nonlinear vibration characteristics of the HSD-SDD system make it difficult to properly control it using classic proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller settings. A method of tuning the PID controller parameters has been proposed using the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm, which adapts to the vibration variation of the HSD-SDD system. The RLS algorithm with a forget factor was used to assign more weight to recent data, which is suitable for adaptive controller tuning.\nUsing the backward Euler method for integrals and derivatives in a given sampling period Ts and modifying the derivative termwith a low-pass filterHLPF , aGPID transfer function\nin the z-domain of the PID controller is represented by [29]\nGPID (z) = u (z) e (z) = KP + KI T z z\u2212 1 + KD z\u2212 1 N T z\n= [KP KI KD]  1T z z\u22121 z\u22121 N T z  = \u03b8T \u03d5, (49) where Kp is the proportional gain; KI is the integral gain; KD is the derivative gain; T is the sampling period; N is the filter coefficient of the approximate derivative; \u03b8 and is a PID gain vector to be tuned in the controller, \u03b8T = [KP KI KD],\n\u03c6 is a vector with the z-operator \u03c6 = [ 1 T zz\u22121 z\u22121 N T z ]T .\nFirst, a closed-loop experiment is performed to obtain the input/output data u0(k), y0(k), k = 1, . . . ,N , for an initial controller parameter \u03b80, the reference signal yr0(k) is calculated by\nyr0(k, \u03b80) = GPID(z, \u03b80)\u22121 u0(k)+ y0(k). (50)\nThe initial controller parameter \u03b80 is then fine-tuned to minimize the performance index\nJ (\u03b80) = N\u2211 k=0 ( y0(k)\u2212M (z) yr0(k, \u03b80) )2 , (51)\nwhereM (z) denotes the fictitious reference controlmodel that expresses an ideal closed-loop system. The aforementioned tuning procedure was performed offline.\nIn the ideal case\ny0(k)\u2212M (z) yr0(k, \u03b80) = 0. (52)\nAfter substituting (49) into (50) and then into (52), the tuning error is obtained\ne\u0303(k) = \u03b80T \u03d5 (1\u2212M (z)) y0(k, \u03b80)\u2212M (z) u0(k), (53)\n7746 VOLUME 10, 2022\nThen, the tuning method can be applied by minimizing the performance index\nJ\u0303 (\u03b80) = N\u2211 k=0 e\u0303(k)2. (54)\nAfter introducing the parameters y(k) and u(k) into (54), the following signals are defined:\ne\u0303(k) = \u03b8T \u03d5 (1\u2212M (z)) y(k, \u03b8)\u2212M (z) u(k)\n= \u03b8T \u03b4(k) \u2212 d(k), (55)\nwhere \u03b4(k) = \u03d5 (1\u2212M (z)) y(k, \u03b8), d(k) = M (z) u(k). Tuning of the PID controller leads to the minimization of the performance index\nJ\u0303k (\u03b8 ) = k\u2211 i=0 e\u0303(i)2. (56)\nBecause the RLS algorithm cannot cope with all changes in the HSD-SDD reference model, the forgetting factor \u03bb (0 < \u03bb < 1) is introduced. After introducing the forgetting factor \u03bb, performance index (56) is expressed as follows,\nJ\u0303k (\u03b8 ) = k\u2211 i=0 \u03bbk\u2212i e\u0303(i)2. (57)\nThe RLS algorithm after the introduction of the forgetting factor is as follows\nR(k) = P(k \u2212 1) \u03b4(k)\n\u03bb+ \u03b4(k)TP(k \u2212 1) \u03b4(k) , (58)\nwhere P(k) is the covariance matrix P(k) = ( P(k \u2212 1)\u2212 r(k) ( \u03b4(k)TP(k \u2212 1) )) /\u03bb. (59)\nThe recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm finds the optimal estimate of \u03b8\u0302 (k) the controller gains using \u03b8\u0302 (k \u2212 1) at the previous time k\u20131. According to the RLS algorithm, the controller gains \u03b8\u0302 (k) are updated each time.\n\u03b8\u0302 (k) = \u03b8\u0302 (k \u2212 1)+ R(k) ( d(k)\u2212 \u03b4(k)T \u03b8\u0302 (k \u2212 1) ) . (60)\nTo reduce the variability of the controller parameter by updating the implemented PID controller gains, \u03b8 (k) was proposed.\n\u03b8 (k) = (1\u2212 \u03b1) \u03b8 (k \u2212 1)+ \u03b1 \u03b8\u0302 (k \u2212 1), (61)\nwhere \u03b1 is the positive constant, 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1. According to rule (60), \u03b8\u0302 (k) is filtered by an HLPF , which can be defined as [30]:\nHLPF = \u03b1\nz+ \u03b1 \u2212 1 , . (62)\nFigure 22 shows a block diagram for online tuning of the PID controller.\nEach online PID controller parameter tuning algorithm is performed in the following steps:\n1. The initial parameters are set as follows: gain \u03b80 of the controller, forgetting factor \u03bb0 and constant \u03b10.\n2. Calculating signals:\nd(k) = M (z) u(k),\n\u03b4(k) = \u03d5 (1\u2212M (z)) y(k).\n3. Obtaining \u03b8\u0302 (k) from Eqs.(58), (59) and (60). 4. Obtaining \u03b8 (k) from Eq.(61).\nThe proposed online tuning does not provide control stability for the HSD-SDD. The solution to this problem is to ensure the stability of the control system by using the HDS-SDD model.\nIn the online tuning method, the optimum setting of the PID controller depends on the critical ultimate gain Ku and critical ultimate period Tu set at the stability limit (the process of tuning the PID controller occurs in real time). The discrete transfer function of the closed-loop control is considered when the control system depends on the gain factor KP.\nGz(z) = y(z) yr (z) = z\u2212d KP B\n( z\u22121 ) A ( z\u22121 ) + z\u2212dKP B ( z\u22121\n) , (63) where yr is the reference set signal, and A(z\u22121) and B(z\u22121) are polynomials according to Eq.(39).\nThe denominator of the Equation (63) is used to determine its stable poles,\nD(z) = A ( z\u22121 ) + z\u2212dKP B ( z\u22121 ) = 0, (64)\nCharacteristics equation (64) contains a pair of complex roots z1,2 = \u03b1\u00b1j\u03b2 (where .\u03b1 is the real part and .\u03b2 is the imaginary part). For a complex space .\u03b12 + .\u03b22 = r2, where r is the radius of the circle on the complex plane (r = 1). The task is to select the gain factor Kp = Ku(Tp) so that the closed control system is stable, which means that the characteristic equation has roots zi and complies with the condition |zi| < 1 for i = 1, 2, ..,m. Figure 23 shows the positions of the roots in the unit circle of a discrete transfer function. If the gain of the controller increases with the gain margin KG, then the system oscillates with frequency \u03c9u. Therefore, Ku and Tu can be determined from KG and \u03c9u as follows:\nKu = KG = 1\n|Gz(j\u03c9)| , (65)\nVOLUME 10, 2022 7747\nTu = 2\u03c0 \u03c9u , (66)\n\u03c9u = arccos\u03b1RE\nTp , (67)\nwhere Tp is the sampling time and \u03b1Re is the real component depending on the distribution of the roots.\nThe Ziegler-Nichols frequency response method is used as a PID tuning method containing a proportional controller attached to the HSD-SDD system in a closed-loop configuration. In this classical method of tuning PID controller parameters, the aim is to increase the gain of the controller until a sustained oscillation is recorded, which is called the ultimate gain Ku, and to measure the period of the oscillation, which is called the ultimate period Tu. This method is effective if the control process can handle oscillations, is a \u2018\u2018self-regulating\u2019\u2019 process, and seeks a steady-state condition. The measured values of the critical ultimate gain Ku and the critical ultimate period Tu of the PID controller for a sin input frequency of 0.48 Hz are shown in Fig. 24.\nThe PID controller gains were calculated according to the Ziegler-Nichols frequency response method using the following formula [31]: KP = 0.6Ku KI = 1.2 Ku Tp Tu KD = 0.075 Ku Tu\nTp ,\n(68)\nC. HYBRID CONTROL STRUCTURE The purpose of the hybrid control structure of the HSD-SDD system, which includes a feedforward controller, feedback controller, and shaping filter, is to compensate for badly damped vibrations after SDD application. Vibration effects can cause deterioration in the response speed, control accuracy, and stability of the HSD. A hybrid feedforward and feedback control methodwas proposed to improve the control precision and mitigate the effects of nonlinearities and badly damped vibrations of the HSD-SDD system. The hybrid control structure of the HSD-SDD system is shown schematically in Fig. 25.\nThe hybrid control structure includes a PID feedback controller with a transfer function GPID(z), feedforward controller with an FIR feedforward filter Hf (z,\u03b8), FIR input shaping filter Hs(z), and HSD-SDD dynamic model G(z) with measurement of the output signal y (displacement of the actuator). This study proposes a combination of input shaping with feedforward control, whereby the oscillations induced by impulse forces are effectively damped, resulting in better control accuracy. The function of the feedforward regulator is to balance the dynamics of the HSD-SDD system using an inverse transition function. The pure inverse of the transfer function G(z) yields an improper transfer function Gf (z):\nGf = G(z)\u22121. (69)\nIn a flexible system such as an HSD-SDD, the transfer functionG(z) is usually strictly proper, whichmakes it impossible to realize the inverse transfer functionGf (z), which may be unstable. Therefore, two finite impulse response (FIR) filters, an input-shaping filterHs(z) and an inverse filterHf (z, \u03b8) of a feedforward controller were used to compensate for the\n7748 VOLUME 10, 2022\nbadly damped vibration in the HSD-SDD system. Note that there are no poles in the FIR filters, therefore there are no stability problems.\nAfter introducing an input-shaping filter Hs, the input signal ys to the feedback loop is\nys = Hs(z) yr . (70)\nAn FIR input-shaping filter Hs(z) was used to reduce the residual vibration of the flexible systems. The FIR input shaping filter in the z-plane can be represented as [32]\nHs(z) = M\u2211 n=0 bn z\u2212n, (71)\nwhere bn is a constant whose value depends on the index n. An FIR feedforward filter (called a compensator) Hf (z, \u03b8) was used to reduce vibrations in the elastic structures. The FIR feedforward filter with variable coefficients has the form [33]:\nHf (z, \u03b8) = N\u2211 n=1 Cn(z) fn(\u03b8 ), (72)\nwhere Cn(z) is the function in the z-plane given by the designer and fn(\u03b8 ) are functions with unknown tunable coefficients \u03b8 \u2208 <N.\nThe equation resulting from the block diagram in Fig. 25 is considered\ny(z) = G(z)\n( Hf (z, \u03b8)+ GPID(z) Hs(z) ) 1+ GPID(z) G(z) yr (z), (73)\nu(z) = Hf (z, \u03b8)+ GPID Hs(z)\n1+ GPID(z) G(z) yr (z), (74)\nyr (z) = 1+ GPID(z) G(z)\nHf (z, \u03b8)+ GPID Hs(z) u(z), (75)\ne = Hs(z) yr (z)\u2212 y\n= Hs(z)\u2212 G(z) Hf (z, \u03b8) 1+ GPID(z) G(z) yr (z) = Hs(z) K (z) u(z)\u2212 Hf (z, \u03b8) K (z) y(z), (76)\nwhere K (z) is the factor for the initial filter coefficient \u03b8 = \u03b80 and K (z) = Hf (z, \u03b80)+ GPID(z)Hs(z). The coefficients \u03b8 of the Hf feedforward filter were determined using the SISO gradient approximation algorithm [33]. The goal of optimizing the hybrid control structure is to determine an FIR feedforward filter coefficient that minimizes the objective function:\n\u03b8\u0303 = arg min \u03b8 V (\u03b8 ), (77)\nwhere V (\u03b8 ) is the objective function, which is defined as the square of the 2-norm of the control error e(\u03b8 ), and \u03b8 is the n-vector \u03b8 = [\u03b81, \u03b82, . . . , \u03b8n]T\nV (\u03b8 ) = e(\u03b8 )T e(\u03b8 ). (78)\nObjective function (78) leads to a convex optimization problem, which means that a global optimal solution is\nachievable. The gradient vector of theV (\u03b8 ) objective function is given by the partial derivative of each independent variable. Second-order partial derivatives can be represented by a square symmetric matrix called Hessian matrix H (\u03b8 ), which contains n elements:\n\u2207V (\u03b8 ) \u2261 \n\u2202V \u2202\u03b81 \u2202V \u2202\u03b81 ... \u2202V \u2202\u03b8n\n , (79)\n\u2207 2V (\u03b8 ) \u2261 H (\u03b8 ) \u2261  \u22022V \u22022\u03b81\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u22022V \u2202\u03b81 \u2202\u03b8n\n... ...\n\u22022V \u2202\u03b8n \u2202\u03b81\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u22022V \u22022\u03b8n  .(80) Then, by minimizing the objective function, a second-order Taylor series expansion of V about \u03b8k is considered\nV (\u03b8 ) \u2248 V (\u03b8k )+\u2207V (\u03b8k )T (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8k)\n+ 1 2 (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8k) T \u2207 2(\u03b8k ) (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8k) , (81)\nwhere k is the trial number, five experiments are carried out. Minimizing the objective function V (\u03b8k) follows from applying a Gauss-Newton update law\n\u03b8k+1 = \u03b8k \u2212 \u03b1k\n( \u2207 2V (\u03b8k ) )\u22121 \u2207V (\u03b8k ), (82)\nwhere \u03b1 is the step length. The gradients in formula (82) are defined as follows\n\u2207V (\u03b8k ) \u2248 2\u2207eT (\u03b8k ) e(\u03b8k ), (83) \u2207 2V (\u03b8k ) \u2248 2\u2207eT (\u03b8k ) \u2207e(\u03b8k ). (84)\nThe global minimum is solved for the coefficient\n\u03b8\u0303 = \u03b8k+1 \u2212 \u03b8k = \u2212\u03b1k ( \u2207eT (\u03b8k ) \u2207e(\u03b8k ) )\u22121 \u2207eT (\u03b8k ) e(\u03b8k ).\n(85)\nFinally, the global minimum is calculated from the control error based on the measurement of the input signal u and the output signal y.\nIX. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The effectiveness of the hybrid control system used to compensate for badly damped vibrations was confirmed by an experiment conducted on the test stand. Figure. 26 compares the characteristics of the displacement step response y(t) of the HSD-SDD system with and without compensation for the badly damped vibration at a frequency of 21 Hz generated by the impact force of the rock breaker. Furthermore, Fig. 27 compares the frequency characteristics of the HSD-SDD system with and without compensation for the badly damped vibrations.\nVOLUME 10, 2022 7749\nThe characteristics in the time and frequency domains show the effect of the compensation of weakly damped vibrations in the hybrid control system. The characteristics of the frequency domain are more precise than those of the time domain because they exhibit vibration amplitudes with resonant vibrations. The use of the hybrid control structure reduced the amplitude by 50% of the resonant vibration at 21 Hz. The main contribution of this study is a new approach to the hybrid control structure that allows the compensation of vibrations that are badly damped by the cyclic impact force generated by the rock breaker used in jaw crush-\ners. Future work will propose a hybrid control structure for vibration compensation in a wider bandwidth of excitation frequencies.\nThe influence of the frequency of the hydraulic actuator movement on the quality of HSD control was analyzed. The evaluation was performed according to the following criteria,\n\u2022 Absolute deviation of the position signal\n\u03b4yi = |yr \u2212 yi| , (86)\n\u2022 Absolute deviation of the speed signal\n\u03b4vi = |vr \u2212 vi| , (87)\nwhere yr is the reference position signal, yi is the measurement position signal, vr is the reference speed signal, and vi is the measured speed signal.\nThe results of the measurement of the absolute deviations of the position and speed signals for different frequencies of actuator piston movement are shown in Fig. 28.\nIn the event of a small deviation in position and speed signals, the control system is predictable and stable. As the deviation of the signals increases, the control system becomes less predictable and there may be a problem with stability. At a higher frequency of movement, the unfavorable influence of inertial forces that occur in the hydraulic drive system becomes apparent.\nTwo indices were adopted for the rating of the HSDSDD control quality: the integral of square error (ISE) index and the integral of the time-weighted absolute error (ITAE) index. Fig. 29 shows the influence of the piston speed of\n7750 VOLUME 10, 2022\nthe hydraulic actuator on the quality indices of the control system.\nThe relatively small values of the ISE and ITSE indices cause the control system to exhibit high-efficiency transient suppression and a high rate of decay of the control error. As shown in Fig. 29, the ISE index was more sensitive than the ITSE index and had the best selectivity. The ISE indicates that the control quality is better up to a piston speed of 0.3m/s.\nThe hybrid control structure was designed to operate under real conditions; therefore, hardware was used to compensate for the badly damped vibrations. Reliable results for the operation of such a system are based on experimental research with correct theoretical assumptions. The authors concluded that the actual results were more important for evaluating the performance of the HSD-SDD system. The limitation of the use of the hybrid control structure is the stable behavior of the HSD-SDD system and the effectiveness of the compensation of vibrations that negatively impact the work and operation of themanipulator and hydraulic components of the crusher. The main difficulty in applying the control method to compensate for badly damped vibrations is the variable nature of the impact loads generated by a hydraulic rock breaker.\nX. CONCLUSION This study analyzes a difficult and complex construction and scientific problem concerning the control of an HSD flexibly connected by the SDD to the load mass induced by the cyclic impact force generated by a rock breaker mounted on a jaw crusher manipulator boom. An important research\ncontribution is the dynamic model and simulation tests of the HSD-SDD system, which enabled the selection of SDDs to isolate the vibrations generated by the rock breaker. The main scientific contribution was the proposal of a new hybrid control structure of the HSD-SDD system to compensate for badly damped vibrations after using the SDD.\nThe goal of optimizing the hybrid control structure of the HSD-SDD system is to determine an FIR feedforward filter coefficient that minimizes the objective function. The objective function leads to a convex optimization problem, which means that a global optimal solution is achievable. The global minimum of the objective function was calculated from the measurement of the input signal u and output signal y. The gradient vector of the objective function is given by the partial derivate of each independent variable. Second-order partial derivatives can be represented by a square symmetric matrix called a Hessian matrix.\nThe purpose of the hybrid control structure was to compensate for the badly damped vibrations of the rock breaker excited by the cyclic impact force after the application of a spring damping device (SDD). The HSD-SDD model was saved as a Hammerstein model with unknown parameters, which consisted of two parts: a static nonlinear part and a dynamic linear part. The static nonlinear subsystem is approximated by the set polynomial degree and described by a nonlinear function of the nth order that binds the nonlinear output x(k) to the input u(k). The dynamic linear part is and autoregressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX), that represents the relationship between input x(k) and output y(k). TheGPID transfer function in the z-domain is introduced by applying the Euler backward method to the PID feedback controller. The results of the experiments show that the hybrid control method proposed in this study effectively compensates for the bad-damped vibrations excited by the cyclic impact force, and thus significantly improves the control precision of the HSD-SDD system.\nThe most important detailed conclusions from the study: 1) Simulation tests carried out in the Simscape Fluids simu-\nlation test (MATLAB/Simulink) compared the influence of rigid and flexible HSD connections on its dynamic properties. Simulation tests showed that the omitted flexible connection of an HSD may become a source of unexpected mechanical vibrations. These vibrations can be a source of parasitic vibrations, which are particularly harmful to the mechanical structure and hydraulic components of the manipulators. These observations were confirmed in the user reports of crusher manipulators. 2) The impact of pressure pulsation in a cylinder on the flow fluctuations in a short hydraulic pipeline with lumped parameters was demonstrated. When extreme pressure build-up occurs in the resonance region, the hydraulic pipeline can be damaged. 3) Simulation and experimental studies of HSD-SDD systems are of great importance in the design, control, and operation of heavy hydraulic manipulators with large moving masses and mechanical structures susceptible\nVOLUME 10, 2022 7751\nto elastic deformation. These manipulators are used in construction, roads, and mining machines.\nThe study will be used to conduct research projects on HSD-SDD systems for crusher manufacturers, jaw crusher users, and aggregate producers in the cement industry. The advantages of this research are the operational guidelines for designers of hydraulic manipulators that operate with long-term mechanical vibrations. Design difficulties result from the adaptation of SDD for hydraulic manipulators in stationary crushers.\nREFERENCES [1] M. Jelali and A.
