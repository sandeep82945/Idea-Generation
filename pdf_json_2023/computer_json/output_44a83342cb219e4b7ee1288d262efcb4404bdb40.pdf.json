    "abstractText": "Though a number of formulations have been proposed for phase\u2013field models for hydraulic fracture, the definition of the degraded poroelastic strain energy varies from one model to another. This study explores previously proposed forms of the poroelastic strain energy with diffused fracture and assesses their ability to recover the explicit fracture opening aperture. We then propose a new form of degraded poroelastic strain energy derived from micromechanical analyses. Unlike the previously proposed models, our poroelastic strain energy degradation depends not only on the phase\u2013field variable (damage) but also on the type of strain energy decomposition. Comparisons against closed form solutions suggest that our proposed model can recover crack opening displacement more accurately irrespective of Biot\u2019s coefficient or the pore\u2013pressure distribution. We then verify our model against the plane strain hydraulic fracture propagation, known as the KGD fracture, in the toughness dominated regime. Finally, we demonstrate the model\u2019s ability to handle complex hydraulic fracture interactions with a pre\u2013existing natural fracture.",

This study explores previously proposed forms of the poroelastic strain energy with diffused fracture and assesses their ability to recover the explicit fracture opening aperture. We then propose a new form of degraded poroelastic strain energy derived from micromechanical analyses. Unlike the previously proposed models, our poroelastic strain energy degradation depends not only on the phase\u2013field variable (damage) but also on the type of strain energy decomposition. Comparisons against closed form solutions suggest that our proposed model can recover crack opening displacement more accurately irrespective of Biot\u2019s coefficient or the pore\u2013pressure distribution. We then verify our model against the plane strain hydraulic fracture propagation, known as the KGD fracture, in the toughness dominated regime. Finally, we demonstrate the model\u2019s ability to handle complex hydraulic fracture interactions with a pre\u2013existing natural fracture.\nKeywords: Phase\u2013field; Hydraulic fracture; Multi\u2013scale analysis; Poroelasticity; Fixed stress split"

            "text": "The phase\u2013field model for fracture has become a standard method to simulate fracturing. The model was originally proposed by Bourdin et al. (2000) [12] as a numerical regularization of the variational approach to fracture [39], and can be regarded as a special case for the gradient damage model [30, 62, 77]. Its applications range from ductile [1, 3, 55, 101], dynamic [9, 14, 60, 76], fatigue [20, 52, 83], dessication [19, 47, 63, 65], and to environment assisted fracturing [28, 64, 78, 82, 93, 94]. For hydraulic fracture, which is the main focus of this paper, Bourdin et al. (2012) [11] adapted the phase\u2013field model by including the effects of fluid pressure within fracture and verified the fracture propagation behaviors in an impermeable elastic medium with injection of inviscid fluid. Wheeler et al. (2014) [89] extended the phase\u2013field approach to porous media but with an invariant pore\u2013pressure field, and it was further extended for variant pore\u2013pressure by Mikelic\u0301 et\n\u2217Corresponding author.\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier April 18, 2023\nar X\niv :2\n30 4.\n08 13\n9v 1\n[ m\nat h.\nN A\n] 1\n7 A\nal.(2015a, 2015b) [70, 71]. Since these pioneering works, many phase\u2013field models for hydraulic fracturing have been proposed. Amongst these models, the differences amount mainly to how to treat these two points: 1) distinct hydraulic responses in reservoir (porous media) and fracture (open channel), and 2) degradation of the poroelastic strain energy. We briefly review these two points in the following.\nFor two distinct hydraulic responses, various ways to delineate the fracture from the reservoir domain have been proposed. Mikelic\u0301 et al. (2015a, 2015b) [70, 71] applied a Darcy flow in reservoir and a Poiseuille flow in fracture and relied on the phase\u2013field value to transition between them. Another way to delineate the fracture was proposed by Wilson and Landis (2016) [91] who scaled the fluid viscosity to recover Poiseuille flow in fracture. Santilla\u0300n et al. (2017, 2018) [79, 80] also delineated the fracture domain from the reservoir domain based on the phase\u2013field value, but in their approach, the fracture domain is extracted and built separately with one\u2013dimensional line elements to form a hybrid system with two\u2013dimensional reservoir elements. This one\u2013dimensional fracture domain then has to be updated dynamically as the phase\u2013field profile evolves. Another hybrid method was proposed by [26]. They applied the phase\u2013field model for fracture propagation and once fractures fully develop, then the fractured domain is treated with the discrete contact model. Instead of delineating the fracture domain, Miehe et al. (2015) [69] enhanced the permeability as a function of the deformation. Similarly, Yoshioka and Bourdin (2016) [102] enhanced the permeability with a simple threshold based on the phase\u2013field variable. On the other hand, Lee et al. (2017) [57] set a level\u2013set function to average the two flow systems, which has been followed by many studies [58, 59, 61, 90, 97, 107, 110, 111]. Alternatively, Chukwudozie et al. (2019) [24] averaged the flow in fracture domain using phase\u2013field calculus. In [35, 46], the theory of porous media was used instead to transition between the reservoir flow (Darcy) and the fracture flow (Navier\u2013Stokes). Despite all the different ways to treat the two distinct flows (porous medium and fracture), the models appear to generate reasonable fluid pressure responses at least in the toughness dominated hydraulic fracture where the pressure drop within the fracture is negligible [32].\nFor degradation of the poroelastic strain energy, we have yet seen a convergence while the degradation of the elastic strain energy is more or less standardized. For an elastic medium, the strain energy density without fracture or damage is:\n\u03c8(u) = 1\n2 Cm : \u03b5(u) : \u03b5(u),\nwhere Cm denotes the elastic tensor, and \u03b5 is the linearlized strain defined as \u03b5 = 1/2 ( \u2207u+\u2207Tu ) with \u2207(\u00b7) being the gradient of (\u00b7) and (\u00b7)T being the transpose of (\u00b7). With the phase\u2013field variable v \u2208 [0, 1], which varies from intact v = 1 to fully broken v = 0, the general degraded strain energy takes the form:\n\u03c8(u, v) = 1\n2 Ceff(v) : \u03b5(u) : \u03b5(u),\nwhere Ceff(v) = v2Cm in the original model [12]. However, other forms of Ceff(v) have been proposed depending on the degradation function [81, 92, 95], the type of strain energy decomposition [4, 31, 41, 69], and the material constitutive relationship [75, 87, 112]. For poroelastic media, on the other hand, the so called effective stress, which is the part of the stress borne by the solid, is given as \u03c3eff = Cm : \u03b5 and the total stress, which is balanced with the body force and external loadings, is by \u03c3 = \u03c3eff \u2212 \u03b1mp\u03b4 where \u03b1m is Biot\u2019s coefficient and p is the fluid pressure. While the effective stress (solid part) is degraded with Ceff(v), degradation for the fluid pressure has not arrived at a consensus within the community. Some models do not degrade the fluid pressure at all [48, 108]\nand some do but in various ways [57, 72, 79, 102]1. Our objective in this study is to derive a poroelastic strain energy that is consistent with the explicit fracture representation where the fluid pressure is localized within the fracture. In other words, the poroelastic deformation from the phase\u2013field model should converge to the one from the explicit fracture as the regularization length scale parameter approaches 0. We first revisit the previously proposed forms of poroelastic strain energy and point out the differences in terms of degradation of the fluid pressure related terms. We then derive a degraded poroelastic strain energy from micromechanical analyses. As it turns out, Biot\u2019s parameters depend not only on the phase\u2013field variable (damage) but also on the type of strain energy decomposition. Our proposed poroelastic strain energy is verified to reproduce the theoretical fracture aperture openings. On the other hand, the previously proposed models require the fluid pressure in fracture to be diffused beyond fully fractured domain or certain value of Biot\u2019s coefficient.\nThis paper is structured as follows. The next section recalls three existing formulations of poroelastic strain energy in the phase\u2013field model for hydraulic fracture. We then propose a model with phase\u2013field dependent Biot\u2019s parameters and porosity via micromechanical analysis. Section 3 deals with the numerical implementation of the new proposed model in which the fixed stress split strategy is derived for solving the hydro\u2013mechanical phase\u2013field coupling problem. In section 4, the proposed model is verified against the analytical solutions. The accuracy of the four involved formulations in estimating the fracture aperture is highlighted. Section 5 studies interactions between hydraulic fracture and natural fracture. The paper ends with a conclusion and possible future works.\nThroughout the paper, the following notations are used. Tensorial product of any second\u2013order tensors A and B and fourth\u2013order tensor C are A : B = AijBij and C : B = CijklBkl. The symbol \u2016A\u2016 = \u221a A : A is used to calculate the norm of any second\u2013order tensor A. The identity tensors for the second and fourth order are denoted by \u03b4 and I, respectively. The fourth order projector J and K are expressed in the component form as Jijkl = \u03b4ij\u03b4kl/3 and Kijkl = (\u03b4ik\u03b4jl+\u03b4jl\u03b4jk)/2\u2212\u03b4ij\u03b4kl/3, respectively. The trace operator Tr (\u00b7) is defined as Tr (A) = \u03b4 : A. \u2207(\u00b7) is the gradient of (\u00b7), (\u00b7)T is the transpose of (\u00b7), and \u2207s(\u00b7) is the symmetric part of the gradient of (\u00b7) defined as \u2207s(\u00b7) := 12 (\u2207(\u00b7) +\u2207T(\u00b7)). The overhead dot symbol A\u0307 indicates the time differentiation of variable A."

Several variations of W (u, v, p) have been proposed previously and we explore them in the following.\nWe start with the linear momentum balance and mechanical boundaries of the poroelastic medium in a discrete setting depicted in Fig. 1 (left): \u2207 \u00b7 \u03c3 + b = 0 in \u2126 \\ \u0393 \u03c3 \u00b7 n\u0393 = \u2212pn\u0393 on \u0393 \u03c3 \u00b7 n = t\u0304 on \u2202\u2126t u = u\u0304 on \u2202\u2126u (4)\nwhere \u03c3 denotes the Cauchy (total) stress, b the body force and n\u0393 the normal vector to the fracture. Let the elasticity stiffness tensor for the poroelastic medium be Cm = 3kmJ + 2\u00b5mK where km and \u00b5m are the bulk modulus and the shear modulus for the porous matrix respectively. Following Biot\u2019s poroelasticity [7], the total stress \u03c3 in the porous matrix (\u2126 \\ \u0393) is given as\n\u03c3 = Cm : \u03b5\u2212 \u03b1mp\u03b4. (5) Let us neglect the body force b and the traction t\u0304 in the comparisons that follow in this section for the sake of simplicity. Multiplying (4)-1 by a test function wu \u2208 H1(\u2126 \\ \u0393) and using Green\u2019s formula, (4)\u20132 and (4)\u20133, we have\u222b\n\u2126\\\u0393 [Cm : \u03b5(u)\u2212 \u03b1mp\u03b4] \u00b7 \u03b5(wu)dV \u2212 \u222b \u0393 p[[wu \u00b7 n\u0393]] dS = 0, (6)\nwhere [[\u00b7]] denotes a jump quantity over \u0393. In [24, 102], they considered the poroelastic strain energy of:\nW1(u; p) := \u222b \u2126\\\u0393 1 2 Cm : ( \u03b5(u)\u2212 \u03b1mp 3km \u03b4 ) : ( \u03b5(u)\u2212 \u03b1mp 3km \u03b4 ) dV \u2212 \u222b \u0393 p[[u \u00b7 n\u0393]] dS, (7)\nso that (6) is the first variation of (7) with respect to u assuming that W1 is a function of u. Using a \u0393-convergence property and the co-area formula [11, 24], the last term of (7) can be approximated as \u222b\n\u0393\np[[u \u00b7 n\u0393]]dS \u2248 \u222b\n\u2126\npu \u00b7 \u2207v dV.\nThen the regularized poroelastic strain energy can be W1(u, v; p) \u2248 \u222b\n\u2126\n1 2 Cm :\n( v\u03b5(u)\u2212 \u03b1mp\n3km \u03b4\n) : ( v\u03b5(u)\u2212 \u03b1mp\n3km \u03b4\n) dV \u2212 \u222b \u2126 pu \u00b7 \u2207v dV (8)\nBecause p was considered constant with respect to u in [24, 102] (i.e., \u03b1mp/3km = const.), the poroelastic strain energy can be equivalently written:\nW1(u, v; p) = \u222b \u2126 v2 2 Cm : \u03b5(u) : \u03b5(u) dV \u2212 \u222b \u2126 v\u03b1mp\u03b5(u) : \u03b4 dV \u2212 \u222b \u2126 pu \u00b7 \u2207v dV.\nIntegrating the last term by parts and denoting \u03c8(u, v) = v 2\n2 Cm : \u03b5(u) : \u03b5(u), we have\nW1(u, v; p) = \u222b \u2126 \u03c8(u, v) dV+ \u222b \u2126 v (1\u2212 \u03b1m) p\u2207\u00b7udV+ \u222b \u2126 v\u2207p\u00b7udV\u2212 \u222b \u2202\u2126 vpu\u00b7n dS\u2212 \u222b \u0393\nvpu \u00b7 n\u0393 dS. (9)\nwhere the last term is canceled because v = 0 in the fracture domain. On the other hand in [72], though derived differently, the poroelastic strain energy is defined as\nW2(u, v; p) := \u222b \u2126 \u03c8(u, v) dV + \u222b \u2126 v2 (1\u2212 \u03b1m) p\u2207 \u00b7 udV + \u222b \u2126 v2\u2207p \u00b7 udV \u2212 \u222b \u2202\u2126 pu \u00b7 ndS. (10)\nNote that, in [72], the authors assumed fractures do not reach the domain boundary \u2202\u2126 so that v = 1 on the boundary \u2202\u2126, which means that the last term of W2 corresponds to that of W1 ( \u222b \u2202\u2126 pu \u00b7 ndS = \u222b \u2202\u2126 vpu \u00b7 ndS). Thus, one can observe that the difference between W1 and W2 amounts to the degradation function for the pressure related terms (v or v2)3. Furthermore, we remark another popular form for the poroelastic strain energy, which does not degrade the fluid pressure related terms. Assuming the continuity of \u03c3 over \u2126 (i.e. without imposing (4)\u20132), one obtains [47, 108]:\nW0(u, v; p) := \u222b \u2126 \u03c8(u, v) dV \u2212 \u222b \u2126 \u03b1mp\u2207 \u00b7 udV. (11)\nNow, we have introduced three common forms of the poroelastic strain energy (W0, W1, and W2). In these notations of the poroelastic strain energies, we use different subscripts (0, 1, and 2) to indicate their exponent of v that multiples the pressure terms (v0 = 1, v1 = v, and v2).\nWe propose yet another form here. Following [8, 72], we define W as\nW (u, v, p) := \u222b \u2126 \u03c8(u, v) dV + \u222b \u2126 M 2 [\u03b1\u2207 \u00b7 u\u2212 \u03b6]2 dV (12)\n= \u222b \u2126 \u03c8(u, v) dV + \u222b \u2126 p2 2M dV, (13)\nwhere \u03b1 and M is Biot\u2019s coefficient and modulus for poroelastic medium (\u2126) and \u03b6 is the variation of fluid content given as\n\u03b6 = \u03b1\u2207 \u00b7 u+ p M . (14)\nAs p depends on \u03b5 (i.e. \u2202p/\u2202\u03b5 = \u03b1/M\u03b4)4, the first variation of W with respect to \u03b5 gives\n\u2202W\n\u2202\u03b5 = \u222b \u2126 [Ceff(v) : \u03b5(u)\u2212 \u03b1(v)p\u03b4] dV, (15)\nwhere Ceff is the effective stiffness tensor for the poroelastic medium (\u2126) including the porous matrix (\u2126 \\\u0393) and the crack set (\u0393). Note that Ceff is not the same as the effective stiffness tensor\n3In [70, 71], v2 was chosen over v because v may go below 0 during the minimization, which causes numerical instabilities. In [11, 24, 102], the solution space for v is bounded in [0, 1] by applying a variational inequality solver for v, which permits v to be a degradation function for the fluid pressure.\n4In [72], W is defined similarly to (12), but p is regarded constant with respect to \u03b5.\nfor the porous matrix (\u2126 \\ \u0393) i.e., Ceff 6= Cm. Here, we indicate that both Ceff and \u03b1 depend on the damage (v) so that the total stress is continuous over \u2126, and the condition \u03c3 \u00b7 n\u0393 = \u2212pn\u0393 in Eq. (4)\u20132 is ensured. Biot\u2019s parameters proposed in [86, 100, 106] also depend on the damage (v), but we derive their dependency on the damage (v) from micromechanics analyses in the following section."

(25) is a general form with Am unspecified. In the present work, Ceff will be derived directly from the phase\u2013field model.\nRecall, in the original phase\u2013field model [12], the strain energy is degraded regardless of the deformation direction, i.e., \u03c8(u, v) = v2\u03c8(u). However, a more general form reads [4, 31, 41],\n\u03c8(u, v) = g (v)\u03c8+(u) + \u03c8\u2212(u), (31)\nwhere g(v) is the degradation function representing the material stiffness deterioration due to the regularized macroscopic crack. In this study, we define it as\ng(v) = v2 (32)\nIn addition, \u03c8+ and \u03c8\u2212 in Eq. (31) are the positive and negative parts of strain energy and only the positive part contributes to the phase\u2013field evolution. For the isotropic strain energy model [12], we have \u03c8+(u) = \u03c8(u) and \u03c8\u2212(u) = 0, which reads\n\u03c8iso((u), v) = g (v) 1\n2 \u03b5 : Cm : \u03b5 (33)\nFor the volumetric-deviatoric (V\u2013D) decomposition model [4], we have\n\u03c8vd((u), v) = g(v) [ km 2 \u3008Tr (\u03b5)\u30092+ + \u00b5m\u03b5 : K : \u03b5 ] + km 2 \u3008Tr (\u03b5)\u30092\u2212, (34)\nwhere \u3008\u00b7\u3009 denotes the Macaulay brackets defined as \u3008\u00b7\u3009\u00b1 = (| \u00b7 | \u00b1 \u00b7)/2. The stiffness tensors can then be derived as\nCeff(v) =  3 g(v)km\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 keff (v) J + 2g(v)\u00b5mK for isotropic model\n3 [g(v)H(Tr (\u03b5)) +H(Tr (\u2212\u03b5))] km\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 keff (v) J + 2g(v)\u00b5mK for V\u2013D decomposition model\n(35) where the underlined quantities correspond to the effective bulk modulus keff , and H(\u00b7) is the Heaviside step function defined as\nH(x) :=\n{ 0, x < 0,\n1, x \u2265 0. (36)\nNote that Eq. (25) is only valid for open cracks and therefore a tension-compression transition criterion should be considered. Apparently, for the isotropic model in Eq. (35)\u20131, keff(v) = 3g(v)km holds both in tension and compression which fails to capture the unilateral effect of fracture in geomaterials. On the contrary, the V\u2013D decomposition model uses the sign of volumetric strain as the tension-compression transition criterion. Without loss of generality, we take the V\u2013D decomposition model in the subsequent derivations. As a result, Biot\u2019s coefficient tensor (26) and Biot\u2019s modulus (30) can be expressed by using Eq. (35) and Eq. (21) as\n\u03b1(v) = [ 1\u2212 [g(v)H(Tr (\u03b5)) +H(Tr (\u2212\u03b5))] km\nks\n] \u03b4 = \u03b1(v)\u03b4 (37)\n1 M(v) = \u03b1(v)\u2212 \u03c6 ks + \u03c6cf , (38)\nwhere now \u03b1(v) is associated with the phase\u2013field variable and can be expressed as\n\u03b1(v) = 1\u2212 [g(v)H(Tr (\u03b5)) +H(Tr (\u2212\u03b5))] km ks\n= 1\u2212 [g(v)H(Tr (\u03b5)) +H(Tr (\u2212\u03b5))] (1\u2212 \u03b1m). (39)\nFor a fractured material (v = 0 and g(v) = 0), the fracture is open when Tr (\u03b5) \u2265 0, and Biot\u2019s coefficient is enhanced, i.e. \u03b1(v) = 1 \u2212 g(v) + g(v)\u03b1m = 1. On the other hand, when Tr (\u03b5) < 0,\nthe fracture is closed and \u03b1(v) = 1\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b1m) = \u03b1m which corresponds to Biot\u2019s coefficient in the bulk material. Unlike the pre-existing models that consider the degradation of Biot\u2019s parameters [100, 106], the value of \u03b1 expressed in Eq. (39) depends both on the value of the phase\u2013field variable and on the specified strain energy decomposition scheme. Therefore, the unilateral effect of fracture can be taken into account if one chooses the V\u2013D decomposition for example.\nAdditionally, the effective porosity \u03c6 in Eq. (29) is related to the volume fraction of the pennyshaped meso-cracks, i.e., \u03d5. And \u03d5 is approximately 0 because the aspect ratio X of penny-shaped meso-crack is much smaller than 1, and then \u03c6 \u2248 \u03c6m implying that the porosity of RVE\u20131 remains constant as assumed by [86, 96]. Such an assumption is valid for RVEs far from the fracture because the value of \u03c9 is small. For nearly fractured RVEs, however, it is invalid because \u03c9 tends to infinity and therefore \u03d5 tends to 1.\nSince the fracture is diffusely represented in the phase\u2013field model, it is reasonable to introduce a transition function for the porosity with its value ranging from \u03c6m to 1. One of the possibilities is to use the following relationship:\n\u03c6(v) = 1\u2212 [g(v)H(Tr (\u03b5)) +H(Tr (\u2212\u03b5))] (1\u2212 \u03c6m), (40)\nwhich takes a similar expression to \u03b1(v) in Eq. (39). Therefore, Eq. (38) reads\n1 M(v) = \u03b1(v)\u2212 \u03c6(v) ks + \u03c6(v)cf . (41)\nAs a result, Biot\u2019s parameters (\u03b1, M), porosity (\u03c6) and effective stiffness tensor (Ceff) are now associated with the phase\u2013field variable (v)."

K and \u00b5 are the permeability tensor and fluid viscosity, respectively.\nIn this work, we consider Darcy flow both in fracture and porous matrix rather than using a diffraction system [57] or phase\u2013field calculus [24, 25] to average or transition between Dacry flow in porous media and Reynolds/Poiseuille flow in fracture [35, 46]. Instead, the permeability is enhanced by the evolution of meso-cracks5 as in [69, 102].\nWe employ an empirical formulation of anisotropic permeability which implicitly takes into account the Poiseuille-type flow [68, 69] in the macroscopic crack, i.e.,\nK = Km\u03b4 + (1\u2212 v)\u03be w2\n12 (\u03b4 \u2212 n\u0393 \u2297 n\u0393) , (43)\n5Further investigations on this point can be found for example in [22, 23, 51] where damage-induced permeability variation was theoretically analyzed from the micromechanical aspect and identified through laboratory experiments. Basically, dozens of parameters need to be calibrated experimentally.\nwhere Km is the isotropic permeability of the porous media, \u03be \u2265 1 is a weighting exponent, and w denotes the fracture aperture.\nThe weighting exponent has no impact in fully fractured elements where v = 0 because (1\u2212v)\u03be = 1. On the contrary, it lessens the permeability enhancement in the transition zone where v < 1 because (1\u2212v)\u03be \u2192 0 as \u03be \u2192\u221e. An alternative way to give such a high contrast to the permeability in fully fractured elements (v = 0) would be to set w = 0 everywhere except where v = 0. However, we find that this would put too much contrast in the permeability and some regularization in the permeability field such as this weighting is necessary for numerical stability.\nBecause the flow velocity is proportional to its square as in Eq. (42), estimation of w is important and should not be treated lightly [104]. In this study, we use an approach proposed by [69], i.e.,\nw = heTr (\u03b5) , (44)\nwhere he is the characteristic length which is taken as the element size in the present work. Furthermore, the crack normal vector n\u0393 needs to be resolved for Eq. (43). Bourdin et al. [11] approaximated n\u0393 from the gradient of the phase\u2013field (e.g. n\u0393 \u2248 \u2207v/|\u2207v|), which has been followed by many [26, 44, 53, 68, 71, 79]. However, as pointed out by [24], the gradient of the phase\u2013field deviates from the normal direction near the crack tip. Another issue is that \u2207v is not defined at fully fractured elements where v = 0, which requires an additional operation such as L-2 projection [53]. In this study, we estimate the normal vector from the principal strains at integration points. We first decompose a strain tensor as\n\u03b5 = 3\u2211 i=1 \u03b5iei, (45)\nwhere \u03b5i are the principal strains with \u03b51 > \u03b52 > \u03b53 and ei are the associated eigenvectors. Then we assign\nn\u0393 = e1. (46)\nOne advantage of this approach is that it is easy to parallelize the computation because it is performed locally at each integration point while the line integral [11] or level\u2013set [57] based approach requires global phase\u2013field profile. This approximation is sufficiently accurate for hydraulic fracture application as demonstrated in Section 4. However, for other applications such as frictional sliding [37], one may require more involved approaches based on image processing techniques [16, 98, 113]."

All the boundaries are assigned with no-flow (undrained) boundary except for the left edge that is drained, i.e., p = 0 Pa.

In this case, damage evolution is not involved, and only displacement and pressure fields are solved. The time increment is taken as \u2206t = 1 s. We can observe a good agreement between the analytical and numerical results for pressure and displacement distributions (Fig. 4)."

            "text": "In this section, we test our crack opening computation through Sneddon\u2019s internally pressurized line crack [\u2212a0, a0] \u00d7 {0} in an infinite domain [84]. Though this example has become one of the standard tests for phase\u2013field hydraulic fracture models [11, 43, 49, 53, 57, 79, 89, 104, 107], not all the models recovered the theoretical crack opening accurately. The computation geometry and boundary conditions are depicted in Fig. 7a. The crack length is taken as 2a0 = 2.2 m. Here, the initial static crack is represented by assigning v = 0 to the corresponding elements (i.e., \u2018pf-ic\u2019 field in Fig .7a).\nThe analytical solution of crack opening displacement under pressurization is given as [84]\nu+(x, 0) = 2pa0 E\u2032\n\u221a 1\u2212 ( x\na0\n)2 , (67)\nwhere E\u2032 = E/(1 \u2212 \u03bd2), x is the distance to the crack center and p is the internal pressure taking as p = 105 Pa. As the solution is based on the assumption of elastic material, we take the material parameters as follows: Young\u2019s modulus E = 1.7 \u00d7 1010, Poisson\u2019s ratio \u03bd = 0.2 and \u03b1m = 0, \u03c6m = 0.\nWith the diffused representation of crack by the phase-field model, we need to account for the extra energy near the crack tip as discussed in [40, 104]. Accordingly, a closed-form expression for the effective crack length is given as [104]\naeff = a0\n( 1 +\n\u03c0`/4\na0 (h/4cn`+ 1)\n) . (68)\nIn the following computations, the crack lengths are normalized by aeff . Note that aeff approaches a0 as ` \u2192 0. We used AT1 in the following examples because AT1 was reported to recover crack openings more accurately [104].\nFor the prescribed pressure field, we consider the localized pressure field (Fig. 7b) where the pressure is elevated (p = 105 Pa) only in the fully broken elements (v = 0). This localized pressure field is supposed to represent the actual hydraulic fracture situation where the fluid pressure within the fracture is distinctively higher than the surrounding.\nVerification of our proposed model\nFirst, we ascertain the influences of mesh resolution and length scale parameter. Fig. 8(a) shows the impacts of mesh resolution where we keep the ratio of length scale parameter ` and minimum element size (denoted by h) as `/h = 4. The results indicate that roughly 20 elements over the span of the initial crack geometry will give an acceptable result, which is consistent with the conclusion from [29]. Fig. 8(b) shows the results where the mesh size is kept to h = 0.025 m while ` alters. We see that a smaller value of ` corresponds to a better match with the analytical solution.\nComparison against previously proposed models\nNext, we compare the three previously proposed models (W0, W1, and W2) with our proposed model (W ) using the same mesh resolution (a0/h = 44), length scale parameter (`/h = 2) and material parameters. These four models introduce different modifications to the poroelastic strain energy corresponding to different momentum balance equations.\nFig. 9(a) compares crack opening displacement computed using the localized pressure field. Our proposed model with diffused poroelasticity matches the analytical result, while the other three models fall short of it. However, we should consider the two underlying assumptions in these models.\nThe first assumption is about the pressure field. For W1 and W2, the deformation depends on \u2207v (or \u2207p after integration by parts in Eqs. (9) and (10)). In other words, without diffusing the fluid pressure in the crack, the deformation in the surrounding media will be underestimated. Thus, for further comparisons, we consider the distributed pressure field where the fluid pressure (p = 105 Pa) is uniformly distributed in the entire domain (Fig. 7c). Fig. 9(b) shows computed cracking openings with the distributed pressure field and we can see that the models with W , W1, and W2 match the analytical solution, but not with W0.\nThe second assumption is about Biot\u2019s coefficient. In particular, the model with W0 requires that \u03b1m = 1 to guarantee the stress continuity condition on the crack interface (Eq. (4)\u20132). On the other hand, the stress continuity on the crack interface is explicitly considered in the W , W1, and W2 models. Figs. 10 show computed cracking opening displacements with three different Biot\u2019s coefficients (\u03b1m = 0, 0.5, and 1.0) with the localized pressure field. The model with W0 can now predict the analytical crack opening profile with \u03b1m = 1 accurately, but the results are sensitive to the value of \u03b1m unlike the other models.\nTo be fair, we should note that we have tested these models in the conditions for which they were not intended for. The models with W1 and W2 diffuse a pressure field beyond the fully fractured domain (v = 0) using the level\u2013set [57] or phase\u2013field calculus [24]. The setting of this distributed pressure may be unrealistic, but in actual computations, the pressure field only needs to be diffused over the transition zone where v < 1, and as long as the transition zone is localized (i.e., small `), the pressure can also be localized to some extent.\nIn this simple case, the pressure in the fracture domain is constant, and the pressure field can be easily diffused or reconstructed. In practice, however, the pressure profile in the fracture may vary, and that may cause inaccurate deformation for complex fracture networks. For this reason,\nthe model should be able to estimate the crack opening correctly with the localized pressure field irrespective of Biot\u2019s coefficient such as W ."

            "text": "We now move on to the hydraulic fracturing problem under a plane strain condition, known as the KGD (Kristianovich-Geertsma-de Klerk) model [32, 50]. The geometry and boundary conditions are presented in Fig. 11 where only half of the model is considered because of the symmetry. The size of the computation domain is 45 m \u00d7 120 m and the height is taken relatively large to approximate an infinite plane. The KGD problem concerns the propagation of a planar fracture by injecting incompressible fluid into the impermeable elastic domain. Therefore, we take \u03b1m = 0, \u03c6m = 0 and cf = 0, mimicking the elastic solid and incompressible fluid respectively except for the permeability which has to be greater than zero for the stiffness matrix in Eq. (66) to be positive definite. The weighting exponent \u03be for fracture permeability in Eq. (43) is taken as \u03be = 10. The other parameters are listed in Table 3.\nSimilarly to the analyses in Section 4.3, we use an effective fracture energy parameter Geffc that\naccounts for the diffused representation of crack by the phase-field model [13, 85, 104]:\nGeffc = Gc\n( 1 + h\n4cn`\n) . (69)\nAlso, to recover the crack length from a diffused-represented crack by the phase-field model, we employ this relationship [103]:\nL =\n\u222b \u2126 Gc 4cn [ (1\u2212\u03bd)n ` + `\u2207v \u00b7 \u2207v ] dV\nGeffc , (70)\nwhere the numerator of the right hand side denotes the crack surface energy which can be readily computed using Gaussian integral on the discretized domain.\nFor the toughness-dominated regime, Garagash [42] presents an analytical solution (see also [79] Appendix A for a detailed derivation). The dimensionless viscosity M is defined as\nM = \u00b5 \u2032Q\nE\u2032\n( E\u2032\nK \u2032\n)4 , (71)\nwhere \u00b5\u2032 = 12\u00b5, E\u2032 = E1\u2212\u03bd2 and K \u2032 =\n\u221a 32Geffc E \u2032\n\u03c0 . IfM is belowMc = 3.4\u00d7 10\u22123, the propagation regime is toughness dominated. And we haveM = 3.8\u00d710\u22127 with the parameters listed in Table 3.\nWe now examine the proposed phase-field model W (Eq. (12)) with various mesh sizes and matrix permeabilities. The ratio of ` and h remains constant, i.e., `/h = 4 throughout different mesh sizes. The time increment is taken as \u2206t = 0.01 s in the first 10 steps and \u2206t = 0.1 s in the remaining steps. The pressure and crack opening at the injection point and the length of the crack are recorded during hydraulic fracturing.\nUsing Km = 1 \u00d7 10\u221218 m2, we compare the results for three different mesh sizes, i.e., a0/h = 20, 40 and 80 in Figs. 12(a), 13(a) and 14(a). As we can see, a finer mesh corresponds to a closer approximation to the analytical solutions of the pressure and crack opening at the injection point, but the crack length is less sensitive to the mesh refinement because the expression in Eq. (70) already accounts for the effects of phase-field regularization.\nUsing a0/h = 40, we compare the results for three different values of the permeability, i.e., Km = 1\u00d7 10\u221219, 1\u00d7 10\u221218 and 5\u00d7 10\u221218. Fig. 12(b) shows that the critical pressure for the onset of fracture propagation is not affected by the permeability of the porous material. However, a higher permeability will delay the onset of fracture propagation because more fluid leaks off to the surrounding porous media. Furthermore, the crack opening and propagation are smaller for the higher permeabilities (Fig. 13(b) and Fig. 14(b)). To capture the KGD fracture propagation in an impermeable media, the permeability needs to be low (e.g., Km = 1 \u00d7 10\u221219 m2), but extremely low permeabilities will cause numerical instabilities in solving the hydraulic equation."

            "text": "In this section, we demonstrate the proposed model\u2019s ability to simulate hydraulic fracture propagation under the presence of a natural fracture. We represent a natural fracture using the interface modeling method proposed by [45, 103] by assigning the effective interface fracture toughness. This method provides a simple but robust description of the deflection and penetration of a crack impinging into an interface. The geometry of this numerical model is shown in Fig. 15 where a natural fracture with weaker fracture toughness is placed 2.2 m away from the initial hydraulic fracture. The sizes of the domain and initial hydraulic fracture are the same as the setting in Fig. 7, and the length of this natural fracture is 10 m. We consider two different inclination angles, \u03b2 = 90\u25e6 and 165\u25e6, and two different interface toughness, Gintc /Gc=0.2 and 0.5. The parameters are the same as those listed in Table 3 except that we take Biot\u2019s coefficient \u03b1m = 0.6, porosity \u03c6m = 0.01 and permeability Km = 5 \u00d7 10\u221218 to account for poroelastic effects. The weighting exponent \u03be for fracture permeability is taken as \u03be = 50 in this case.\nAn incompressible fluid is injected at the center of the initial hydraulic fracture with the injection rate of 2\u00d7 10\u22123 m2/s. The crack will propagate after the pressure reaches a critical value and then impinge on the natural fracture.\nWe first investigate the effect of natural fracture with an inclination angle of \u03b2 = 90\u25e6. Figs. 16 and 17 show that the hydraulic fracture branches along the weaker interface (Gintc = 0.2Gc), but bypasses the relatively stronger interface (Gintc = 0.5Gc). As can be seen, the cementation state of the interface (represented by different interface toughness) impacts the final hydraulic channel network and the resulting pressure field.\nFurthermore, Figs. 16(d) and 17(d) show that Biot\u2019s coefficient transitions smoothly from 0.6 to 1 around the crack tip while it changes sharply in the vicinity of induced hydraulic fracture. As Biot\u2019s coefficient (Eq. (17)) depends both on the phase-field variable and on the strain decomposition strategy, pressurizing a hydraulic fracture will induce compressive strains in the nearby reservoir. Consequently, we have H(Tr (\u03b5)) = 0 and obtain \u03b1 = \u03b1m. And the unilateral contact effect of the fracture on Biot\u2019s coefficient can be well captured by the proposed model.\nFig. 18(a) shows the pressure responses for two interface toughness with \u03b2 = 90\u25e6. These two responses are identical in the early time until the hydraulic fracture starts interacting with the natural fracture. For Gintc /Gc = 0.2, we see a sudden drop when the hydraulic fracture branches along the interface. Once the branched fractures reach the reservoir media, the pressure starts to increase. In contrast, for Gintc /Gc = 0.5, we see only a slight pressure drop when the hydraulic fracture bypasses the weak interface but then it follows back the original pressure decline trend.\nWith \u03b2 = 165\u25e6, the natural fracture attracts the hydraulic fracture as shown in Figs. 19(a) and 20(a). The smaller Gintc /Gc, the easier and earlier the hydraulic fracture is attracted into the natural fracture (18(b)). After the hydraulic fracture propagates through the natural fracture, the pressure increases until the propagation resumes in the reservoir media (see Figs. 19(a) and 20(a)).\nThe distributions of Biot\u2019s coefficient also show a sharp change in the vicinity of developed hydraulic fracture and a smooth transition in the crack tip. The examples demonstrate that our approaches for width Eq. (44) and crack normal vector Eq. (45) computations are well applicable to complex hydraulic fractures."

Our proposed Biot\u2019s parameters depend not only on the phase-field variable but also on the type of energy decomposition, and the poroelastic strain energy is degraded through Biot\u2019s parameters rather than degrading the fluid pressure terms. The theoretical analysis shows that our proposed model automatically ensures the stress continuity on the crack interface (i.e., \u03c3 \u00b7 n\u0393 = pn\u0393 with v = 0). Our proposed model was compared against the three commonly-used phase-field models for poroelastic media, and it can more accurately recover crack opening displacements irrespective of the pressure profile or Biot\u2019s coefficient. The proposed model was also verified against the KGD fracture solution in the toughness-dominated regime. Furthermore, we simulated hydraulic fracture interactions with a natural fracture to demonstrate its capability for dealing with complex hydraulic fracture behaviours.\nThe proposed model is implemented in an open source code, OpenGeoSys [6]. As future study, the model is to be extended for thermo-hydro-mechanical and phase-field coupling problems. On\nthe other hand, to deal with the loss of local mass conservation of fluid for the traditional continuous Galerkin finite element method, the mixed finite element method [38] or enriched Galerkin finite element method [56] may be needed in the future.\nCRediT author statement\nAll authors have contributed equally."
