 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate more advanced prediction structures for the base layer in the proposed SVC schema to improve compression efficiency. The paper currently uses a simple temporal prediction structure, but more complex hierarchical prediction structures could be explored.

2. Explore the performance of the proposed schema on newer video codecs like VVC/H.266 and AV2. The paper implements the schema using AV1, but newer codecs may offer further improvements. 

3. Evaluate the performance of the proposed schema in practical streaming systems and networks. The paper shows codec-level results, but real-world streaming performance should be validated.

4. Study the integration of the proposed SVC schema with existing VR/360 streaming formats like OMAF. Backward compatibility and integration with established formats is important.

5. Extend the schema to support additional scalability modes like quality/SNR scalability and test for 360 video applications. More scalability dimensions could improve adaptability and performance.
