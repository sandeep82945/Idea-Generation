    "abstractText": "Background The majority of people with a chronic disease (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, COPD) have more than one concurrent condition and are also at higher risk for developing comorbidities in mental health, including anxiety and depression. There is an urgent need for more relevant and accurate data on digital interventions in this area to pre\u2010 pare for an increase demand for mental health services. The aim of this study was to conduct a meta\u2010analysis of the digital mental health interventions for people with comorbid physical and mental chronic diseases to compare the effect of technology systems and level of support. Methods This secondary meta\u2010analysis follows a rapid review of systematic reviews, a virtual workshop with knowl\u2010 edge users to identify research questions and a modified Delphi study to guide research methods: What types of digital health interventions (according to a recognized categorization) are the most effective for the management of concomitant mental health and chronic disease conditions in adults? We conducted a secondary analysis of the primary studies identified in the rapid review. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts and applied inclusion criteria: RCT design using a digital mental health intervention in a population of adults with another chronic condition, published after 2010 in French or English, and including an outcome measurement of anxiety or depression. Results Seven hundred eight primary studies were extracted from the systematic reviews and 84 primary studies met the inclusion criteria Digital mental health interventions were significantly more effective than in\u2010person care for both anxiety and depression outcomes. Online messaging was the most effective technology to improve anxiety and depression scores; however, all technology types were effective. Interventions partially supported by healthcare professionals were more effective than self\u2010administered. Conclusions While our meta\u2010analysis identifies digital intervention\u2019s characteristics are associated with better effec\u2010 tiveness, all technologies and levels of support could be used considering implementation context and population. Trial registration The protocol for this review is registered in the National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools (NCCMT) COVID\u201019 Rapid Evidence Service (ID 75).",

We conducted a secondary analysis of the primary studies identified in the rapid review. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts and applied inclusion criteria: RCT design using a digital mental health intervention in a population of adults with another chronic condition, published after 2010 in French or English, and including an outcome measurement of anxiety or depression.\nResults Seven hundred eight primary studies were extracted from the systematic reviews and 84 primary studies met the inclusion criteria Digital mental health interventions were significantly more effective than in\u2011person care for both anxiety and depression outcomes. Online messaging was the most effective technology to improve anxiety and depression scores; however, all technology types were effective. Interventions partially supported by healthcare professionals were more effective than self\u2011administered.\nConclusions While our meta\u2011analysis identifies digital intervention\u2019s characteristics are associated with better effec\u2011 tiveness, all technologies and levels of support could be used considering implementation context and population.\nTrial registration The protocol for this review is registered in the National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools (NCCMT) COVID\u201119 Rapid Evidence Service (ID 75).\nKeywords Digital interventions, Mental health, Chronic diseases, Meta\u2011analysis, Rapid review\n*Correspondence: Maxime Sasseville maxime.sasseville@fsi.ulaval.ca Full list of author information is available at the end of the article"

            "text": "Chronic diseases are the main burden on health systems in developed countries and account for almost 70% of deaths worldwide [1]. The majority of people with a chronic disease (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) have more than one concurrent condition and are also at higher risk for developing comorbidities in mental health, including anxiety and depression [2]. The prevalence of depression or anxiety together with another chronic health disease is approximated to 27% in outpatients populations [3, 4]. Studies have also reported a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders in relation to different chronic diseases [5]. Increased use of health services is also observed in people living with a chronic disease and with a concomitant depressive disorder [6]. Canadians primary healthcare interdisciplinary teams, surveyed during the COVID19 pandemic, reported a need for broadening services offering to answer the increase in encounters for mental health issues [7]. There is an urgent need for more relevant and accurate data on digital interventions in this area to prepare for an increase demand for mental health services.\nPractice-based interventions in primary care settings have been shown effective to improve the management of depression in people with chronic diseases [4]. In addition, a large number of interventions using digital technologies have been evaluated for the management of depression or anxiety [8, 9], and systematic reviews indicate that they are effective in providing timely and delocalized care for college students [10]. However, it is still unclear what elements or characteristics of digital interventions for mental health are effective [10].\nA rapid review provides knowledge users with data that can be readily used to inform healthcare decisions [11]. When the topic is broad, it can lead to data that lack precision to fulfil knowledge users\u2019 needs regarding the most effective content and implementation methods. In an effort to gather data on the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions for people with a chronic disease, a rapid review of systematic reviews was completed [12] and offered only an overview of the problem. The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of the digital mental health interventions for people with comorbid physical and mental chronic diseases to compare the effect of technology systems and level of support."

We followed guidelines outlined by the Cochrane Handbook chapter regarding Overview of Reviews and the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group [13, 14]. The review identified a large body of evidence (35 systematic reviews) showing that digital mental health interventions were effective and safe for people with chronic diseases and cancer but that the evidence was still lacking for children and youth populations. To inform the knowledge users at each step, the first stage and lessons learned while developing the project were published elsewhere [12, 15]. The lessons learned paper was published in the native language of the knowledge users (French) and described the process of engaging with our panel and how it informed the review method.\nThree research activities followed the rapid review: a virtual workshop with knowledge users to present our preliminary results and gather their suggestions in nine possible research questions, a modified Delphi study to prioritize the proposed suggestions for the next stage of the review, and a secondary analysis of the primary studies identified through the rapid review. All activities of the study are summarized in Fig.\u00a01."

We translated these knowledge gaps into nine review questions that were\nused as the basis for a modified Delphi study. We developed a questionnaire using the REDCap system [16] and sent a personalized invitation to participants in the workshop, inviting them to complete the survey. These knowledge users were also invited to suggest names of potential additional knowledge users who could have an interest in the topic. The questionnaire comprised two sections. First, participants had to rate on a 5-point Likert scale the importance, relevance, and applicability in the context of COVID-19, each of the nine potential review questions. Second, participants were invited to rank each of the nine questions (1\u00a0 =\u00a0 most important; 9\u00a0=\u00a0 less important) according to their preference (Additional file\u00a01). A total of 16 knowledge users were invited to take part in a two-round Delphi process to identify the key question for the next stage of the knowledge synthesis. All the knowledge users completed the two rounds and all questions reached consensus using median and IQR.

Based on the input from knowledge users, we added inclusion criteria at this stage. We included randomized-controlled trials (RCT) including\na digital health intervention for the management of concomitant mental health and chronic disease conditions in adults, published during the last 10\u00a0years (since 2010) in French or English, and including an outcome measurement of anxiety and/or depression.\nAll the primary studies referenced in the 35 systematic reviews were extracted and included for the citation screening. Six reviewers individually performed screenings for titles, abstracts and then full text using pilot-tested standardized forms on 25 citations for the first level of screening. All citations were reviewed by two reviewers independently at the first level of screening. A standardized extraction form was developed that included study characteristics (e.g., authors, country, design), intervention characteristics (e.g., type of digital intervention), and outcomes reported (measurement tools used, means, standard deviation, and time of measurement). Data were extracted by four research associates, and a senior investigator (MPG) completed a quality appraisal\u00a0of\u00a0all extracted data. Information related to the study characteristics (first author, date of publication, country, population, health condition, type of intervention, outcomes measured, means, standard deviations, author\u2019s conclusions) were extracted directly in the DistillerSR tool [17].\nAs knowledge users were interested in obtaining evidence on specific types of digital health interventions for concomitant mental health and chronic health conditions, we looked for existing classifications of digital health tools to sort interventions. We consulted the WHO Classification of digital health interventions [18]\nand previous reviews on digital mental health solutions [19, 20]. Given the limitations of existing categorizations, we used our own system which considered the technology system, the synchronous or asynchronous nature of the intervention, and the level of professional support (self-administration, partially guided, guided). The classification used ten technology systems categories (not exclusive): Internet or website, computer software, mobile application, electronic messaging (email, SMS), electronic health record, telehealth (telemedicine, telepsychiatry), virtual reality/augmented reality, robot, connected devices, and other system.\nWe completed a meta-analysis of the standardized means difference\u00a0(SMD)\u00a0with an analysis of heterogeneity (\u03c72and I2) for the two outcomes of interest. We used Cohen\u2019s D, fixed-effects meta-analysis and the R software for data analysis.\nThe Cochrane Risk of Bias for Intervention Studies (ROBIS) tool was completed by two investigators (MS,\nMPG) to assess the probability of bias in the included studies. Five types of biases were considered: (1) risk of bias arising from the randomization process; (2) risk of bias due to deviations from the intended interventions; (3) missing outcome data; (4) risk of bias in the measurement of the outcomes; and (5) risk of bias in the detection of the reported results. An overall risk of bias was also assessed.\nWe report our results based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement [21]."

            "text": "This knowledge synthesis aimed to rapidly provide evidence for knowledge users regarding the types of digital mental health interventions that were the most effective for people living with a concomitant chronic disease. This secondary analysis answers a specific research question based on knowledge users\u2019 needs and prioritization. Thus, preliminary work in the form of a workshop and a two-round Delphi study were conducted to identify the top-priority question for knowledge users. This question was \u201cWhat types of digital health interventions are the most effective for the management of concomitant mental health and chronic disease conditions in adults?\u201d. A total of 84 primary studies including anxiety and\ndepression outcomes were identified from the systematic reviews.\nOverall, the results show that digital health interventions are effective to manage mental health issues in adults living with a concomitant chronic condition. The magnitude of the effect varies for anxiety and depression, and heterogeneity is generally high, but the effect size and direction are consistent across studies. Subgroup analyses show that digital mental health interventions with partial support from a healthcare provider have a larger effect size than self-administered interventions. These results are in line with what is known for other populations [107, 108]. There is not enough evidence to conclude in the effectiveness of digital interventions that are completely guided by a healthcare professional because of the lack of studies in this category. One key challenge of self-administered digital mental health interventions is sustaining engagement and reducing dropout [109, 110]. Partially supported interventions are mitigating these challenges by improving interactivity and personalization [111, 112]. However, it is also documented that patients could prefer to only interact with a platform instead than talking with a healthcare professional, highlighting a need for flexible interventions [113]. This meta-analysis shows that partially supported and self-directed digital mental health interventions can be used for patients with chronic diseases and could save clinical time and resources as well as care engagement. Regarding the type of technology used, our analyses show that the most effective type of intervention is\nelectronic messaging, but that all types of technologies are effective for both anxiety and depression scores. This finding adds to the literature on the use of digital mental health to reduce disparities, while considering that technology have varying value across population (e.g., elder, lower socio-economic). Indeed, as our results show that all types of technologies are equally or more effective than usual care, stakeholders could choose and implement interventions in relation with the needs of the population. For example, decision-makers can tailor their choices with respect to cost, ease of access or easing stigma barriers [114].\nMore research will be needed for newer technologies, such as mobile apps and virtual reality, which have showed effectiveness only in a small number of studies with a large confidence interval.\nThe significant statistical heterogeneity observed between studies in every comparison is not surprising and could be likely due to differences in comorbidity, outcome measure used, and content of the intervention. However, patterns shown in this meta-analysis are useful for clinical use and implementation.\nThis knowledge synthesis was informed by knowledge users in order to validate the review questions considering their needs and identify knowledge gaps that would require more evidence. We used a two-stage process, starting with a rapid review of systematic reviews followed by a secondary analysis of the primary studies. Although we used a systematic approach for selecting these studies, a major limitation is that more recent studies were not included in the analyses. To meet the requirement of the funding agency and the urgent need for evidence in the current pandemic, we considered\nonly the most recent studies (published from 2010) from the included reviews. We also assessed the risk of bias in the included studies.\nResults from the meta-analyses should be interpreted with caution since heterogeneity was generally high. Further analyses, including subgroup analyses for different populations, are needed to provide a more detailed and nuanced portrait of the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses, notably by considering the risk of bias related to the lack of blinding of participants, would be required to minimize the risk of an overestimation of the effect. Some studies used multiples systems in the same intervention, which could overestimate the effect size. We also merged together comparator groups, which could affect the interpretation of results for clinical application. Finally, we cannot rule out the possibility of publication bias, as well as other factors that could lessen the level of confidence in the reported effects.\nAvailable evidence suggests that digital health interventions such as internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) could be effective and provide an alternative to face-to-face psychological interventions to manage mental health issues in adults living with a concomitant chronic condition. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital technologies have played a key role in healthcare. Many of these innovations support the care of people in need of medical attention, including those with chronic illnesses. In response to the current crisis, but also to better prepare for the post-crisis and future crises, digital mental health interventions could be a useful tool to manage mental health problems in people living with chronic conditions."
