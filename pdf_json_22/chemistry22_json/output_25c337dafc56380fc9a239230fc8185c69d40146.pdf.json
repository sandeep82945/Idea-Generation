    "abstractText": "Fatty acids (FAs) are crucial energy metabolites, signalling molecules, and membrane building blocks for a wide range of organisms. Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is the first and presumingly most crucial regulator of FA release from triacylglycerols (TGs) stored within cytosolic lipid droplets. However, besides the function of releasing FAs by hydrolysing TGs into diacylglycerols (DGs), ATGL also promotes the transacylation reaction of two DG molecules into one TG and one monoacylglycerol molecule. To date, it is unknown whether DG transacylation is a coincidental byproduct ofATGL-mediated lipolysis orwhether it is physiologically relevant. Experimental evidence is scarce since both, hydrolysis and transacylation, rely on the same active site of ATGL and always occur in parallel in an ensemble of molecules. This paper illustrates the potential roles of transacylation. It shows that, depending on the B Klemens Fellner klemens.fellner@uni-graz.at J\u00e1n Elia\u0161 janelias@ymail.com Peter Hofer peter.hofer@uni-graz.at Monika Oberer m.oberer@uni-graz.at Renate Schreiber renate.schreiber@uni-graz.at Rudolf Zechner rudolf.zechner@uni-graz.at 1 Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Dr. Boehringer-Gasse 5-11, 1121 Vienna, Austria 2 Institute of Mathematics and Scientific Computing, University of Graz, Heinrichstra\u00dfe 36, 8010 Graz, Austria 3 Institute of Molecular Biosciences, University of Graz, Humboldtstra\u00dfe 50, 8010 Graz, Austria 4 BioTechMed Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria 5 BioHealth Field of Excellence, University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria",

            "text": "Fatty acids (FAs) are crucial for ATP production, synthesis of biological membranes, thermogenesis, and signal transduction (Glatz and Luiken 2015; Zechner et al. 2012). Animals and humans store FAs in the form of water-insoluble triacylglycerols (TGs, one species thereof is triolein, TO) within cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) of specialised fat cells called adipocytes, but also in other cell types. From a biochemical perspective, a TG molecule is composed of three FAs esterified to a glycerol backbone. LD-associated TGs are degraded step-wise by an enzymatic cascade of lipid hydrolases commonly designated as \"lipases\" in a process called intracellular lipolysis.\nDistinct lipases are responsible for each lipolytic step (Grabner et al. 2021; Young and Zechner 2013). The initial step in the degradation of TGs is catalysed by adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) releasing one FA and one diacylglycerol (DG, one species thereof is diolein, DO) molecule (Schreiber et al. 2019). In the second lipolytic step, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) hydrolyses DGs into FAs and monoacylglycerols (MGs; one species thereof is monoolein, MO) (Recazens et al. 2021). Finally, monoglyceride lipase (MGL) hydrolyses MGs into FAs and glycerol, both of which can be secreted from the adipocytes into the bloodstream to supply remote organs.\nTo ensure an adequate response to changes in the metabolic state of an organism, lipolysis is fine-tuned by a large number of molecular factors regulating the three lipases (Hofer et al. 2020). One of these factors is comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58) which accelerates lipolysis by increasing ATGL activity (Lass et al. 2006). Despite literally thousands of studies on the physiological role of lipolysis and its complex regulation, a quantitative description of the intricate reaction processes of TG hydrolysis is, however, still missing.\nGiven the outstandingmetabolic importance of lipolysis, it is remarkable thatATGL (and possibly HSL (Zhang et al. 2019)) not only catalyse the hydrolysis reaction but in parallel also a transacylation reaction, which transfers a FA from oneDGonto a second DG to generate TG and MG (Jenkins et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2019; Kulminskaya et al. 2021; Patel et al. 2022). In fact, measurement of ATGL activity is far from being\ntrivial due its hydrolase and transacylase activity occurring simultaneously. Chemical inhibition of ATGL (Kulminskaya et al. 2021) as well as mutations in its active site (Patel et al. 2022) abolish both activities, implying that it is experimentally not possible to separate one activity from the other. For example, as soon as a TGmolecule formed byDG transacylation is hydrolysed toDG, then the effective outcome (one FA andMG were formed) is identical to the outcome of a DG hydrolysis event, thereby masking DG transacylase activity.\nThe importance and potential metabolic function of transacylation is unknown. By its function, the transacylation reaction provides feedback towards the TG pool as well as an alternative in creating MG alongside DG hydrolysis. One may believe that transacylation plays a minor to no role in TG metabolism. However, in vitro experiments from our laboratory (Fig. 1) and others (Jenkins et al. 2004; Kulminskaya et al. 2021) showed remarkable ATGL-mediated DG transacylation.\nThe experimental procedure behind obtaining Fig. 1 uses a well-defined substrate of artificial LDs made of DO (a particular DG) and purified ATGL as sole lipase. More precisely, a truncated variant of mouse ATGL (mAT288) was used since ATGL is biochemically challenging enzyme and removing a functionally non-essential part of ATGL helps its purification. Figure1 shows that when mAT288 was incubated with an emulsion of DO LDs, significant amounts of TO were formed both in absence or presence of the ATGL endogenous co-activator CGI-58. As mentioned above, it is impossible to directly distinguish DO transacylation and DO hydrolysis in Fig. 1, since TOs produced by transacylation are later hydrolysed by ATGL to DOs and FAs.\nIn this paper we study the potential roles of transacylation in relation to the hydrolytic pathway TG \u2192 DG \u2192 MG as sketched in Fig. 2. More precisely, we consider three activities: TG hydrolysis, DG hydrolysis and DG transacylation. We\nwill not include the final step of lipolysis, in which MGL hydrolyses MG to glycerol and FA, since this step is purely downstream and does not interact with the question of understanding the role of DG transacylation.\nTG hydrolysis is primarily catalyzed by ATGL showing robust TG hydrolase activity especially in presence of CGI-58 (Lass et al. 2006). Accordingly, ATGL (Haemmerle et al. 2006) as well as CGI-58 knockout mice (Radner et al. 2010) accumulate TGs to supraphysiological levels in various tissues. However, ATGL can also act as DG transacylase (Jenkins et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2019; Kulminskaya et al. 2021) and DG hydrolase (Zimmermann et al. 2004), indicating that it is also involved in the second lipolytic step. Nevertheless, DG hydrolysis is believed to be primarily catalysed by HSL. Adding to the complexity of lipolysis, HSL also exhibits minor but empirically proven TG hydrolase activity (Fredrikson et al. 1981).\nFor the sake of simplicity and clarity, we will not detail the activities of ATGL and HSL, whose relative contributions are also not sufficiently well understood. Instead, we will combine the functions together into single reaction rates for TG hydrolysis, DG transacylation andDGhydrolysis, see Fig. 2. Specifically, we postulateMichaelis\u2013 Menten (MM) kinetics for TG andDG hydrolysis andmass action law kinetics (MAL) for DG transacylation.\nHowever, both approaches have drawbacks. Firstly, choosing MM kinetics should not be considered as an ultimate modelling choice: Despite the fact that MM kinetic rates for TG andDGhydrolysis can be found in the literature (see e.g. Viertlmayr 2018; Kim et al. 2008 and the references therein) already the mere fact that transacylation occurs in parallel to hydrolysis implies that hydrolysis can at best be approximatively described by MM kinetics. In favour of our modelling choice, the data in Viertlmayr (2018) also show that MM kinetics for TG hydrolysis is still a decent approximation of the real, more complicated dynamics.\nSecondly, using MAL as reaction rate model for an enzymatic transacylation reaction is also questionable. However, we compared parameter fittings for preliminary in vitro experimental data using mAT288 incubated with a phospholipid-emulsified TG substrate and found that usingMM or Hill kinetics instead of MAL didn\u2019t improve the (already good) fitting quality obtain with the MAL model, and despite involving two resp. three fitting parameters instead of one. Hence, Occam\u2019s razor compels us to use a MAL transacylation rate, at least until the molecular mechanism of transacylation becomes better understood.\nFrom amathematical viewpoint, the stoichiometry of DG hydrolysis (involving one DG molecule) is different to DG transacylation (involving two DGmolecules), which implies different nonlinearities of the respective reaction rates. Hence, the relative contributions of DG hydrolysis and DG transacylation depend on the DG concentration, which in return depends on the kinetics producing and processing DGs: We are faced with a complex nonlinear system behaviour. Finally, we also emphasise that\nwe believe that the analysis of this paper can be extended to general superlinear and monotone increasing models for DG transacylation rates.\nLet us denote the substrate concentrations s = [TG], the intermediate concentration q = [DG], the product concentration p = [MG] and the concentration of fatty acids f = [FA]. Then, we consider the reaction rates\nm1(s) = V1s K1 + s and m2(q) = V2q K2 + q and \u03c4(q) = \u03c3q 2, (1)\nwhere V1, K1 and V2, K2 are the corresponding maximum velocities and Michaelis constants of the TG and DG hydrolysis and \u03c3 denotes the MAL constant for the transacylation 2DG \u2192 TG +MG. Note that it is plausible to assume constant concentrations of ATGL and HSL. Hence, there is no explicit dependence of the parameter V1, \u03c3 and V2 on ATGL or HSL.\nThe system of kinetic equations is as follows\n\u23a7 \u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\ns\u0307 = \u2212m1 + \u03c4 = \u2212 V1s K1 + s + \u03c3q 2, q\u0307 = m1 \u2212 m2 \u2212 2\u03c4 = V1s K1 + s \u2212 V2q K2 + q \u2212 2\u03c3q 2, p\u0307 = m2 + \u03c4 = V2q K2 + q + \u03c3q 2,\nf\u0307 = m1 + m2 = V1s K1 + s + V2q K2 + q ,\n(2)\nand we assume that\ns(0) = s0 > 0, q(0) = q0 \u2265 0, p(0) = 0 and f (0) = 0.\nWe remark that p and f are downstream quantities, which are calculated from the solutions of the closed equations for s and q. Therefore, a big part of our analysis will focus on the first two equations.\nThe substrate TG will eventually be fully hydrolysed into products MG and FA through the processes in the reaction scheme in Fig. 2. It is fully hydrolysed even in the case when \u03c4 = 0. The cascade of MM enzyme reactions in Fig. 2 with \u03c4 = 0 has been previously studied (Storer and Cornish-Bowden 1974).\nIn either cases, the total concentrations of fatty acid and glycerol moieties are conserved in time, which leads to two conservations laws\n3s + 2q + p + f = 3s0 + 2q0 and s + q + p = s0 + q0 (3)\nfor all times. As a consequence of the conservation laws and s, q \u2192 0 as time t \u2192 \u221e, system (2) converges at t \u2192 \u221e to the following equilibrium state:\ns, q t\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 0, p t\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 p\u221e := s0 + q0, f t\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 f\u221e := 2s0 + q0.

Moreover, we discuss the general behaviour and illustrate it by plotting a representative phase portrait.\nThe results of this article are summarised as follows: In Sect. 3, we specify three perspectives of judging the role of transacylation and provide a comparative discussion in terms of numerical simulations. As expected from a nonlinear system like (2) the role of transacylation is complicated. It can both speed up and slow down significantly (up to 80% respectively 30%) the production of FAs and MGs. The complexity of the behaviour raises the question, which conditions might allow to use a simplified system as approximation of the full model (2). We will also emphasise that the dynamics depends not only on the parameters, but also on the current state of the hydrolytic machinery. It is possible, for instance, that DG transacylation initially slows downMG production only to altogether speed it up in the long-run of the evolution.\nIn Sect. 4, we exploit that q changes according to one gain and two loss terms, i.e. q\u0307 = m1 \u2212 m2 \u2212 2\u03c4 . We discuss in detail the involved time scales and provided Proposition 4.2, which states conditions for a QSSA to be reasonable justified. More precisely, we identify three non-dimensional parameters, which \u2013 when assumed sufficiently large \u2013 allow q to be approximated by a QSSA.\nIn Sect. 5, for each of these three parameters, we derive the corresponding first order QSSA models. We illustrate these approximations with numerical simulations including some higher order correction terms.\nIn the final Sect. 6, we provide a comprehensive discussion of the findings of the paper. We shall point out that DG transacylation can serve as failsafe mechanism, which produces MGs and FAs in the case of a lacking DG hydrolysis. We will show that this benefit comes at the price of slowing down the hydrolytic machinery in cases when DG transacylation and DG hydrolysis compete for substrate. We will also point out an example case, where the numerical plot of q(t) appears to the eye as alreadywell approximated by its QSSA. Yet, the sensitivity derivative w.r.t. the DG transacylation rate constant \u03ba , which is a qualitative measure of the change due to variations in \u03ba , is predicted wrongly by the QSSA reduced system. Hence, as future works, we suggest to include parameter sensitivity derivatives into the discussion whether a QSSA is an admissible model reduction."

            "heading": "2 Nondimensionalisation and Qualitative Behaviour",
            "text": "We non-dimensionalise the enzymatic model system (2) by rescaling\nt \u2192 t Tref , s \u2192 s Sref , q \u2192 q Qref , p \u2192 p Pref and f \u2192 f Fref ,\nwhere Tref , Sref , Qref , Pref and Fref are the reference time and concentrations. Note that in a slight abuse of notation, we denote dimensional and rescaled non-dimensional variables with the same letters. Different reference time and concentrations can be\nchosen. For general systems, nondimensionalisation is kind of an art and requires skilful considerations. We refer for instance to Segel and Slemrod (2017), Shoffner and Schnell (1989) to review some well-known and less well-known approaches and a comparison of the pros and cons of each. In the following we choose a nondimensionalisation specifically to our model system and our task of comparing the behaviour with and without transacylation.\nAnatural choice for Sref in amodel for TGbreakdown is the initial TGconcentration s0, i.e. Sref = s0 > 0. We choose also Pref = Fref = s0 as TG is ultimately processed into MG and FA. Since TG hydrolysis is the first hydrolytic step, which governs all the other activities, we normalise the time scale accordingly, i.e. Tref = s0/V1. This implies that the s equation rescales like\ns\u0307 = \u2212 V1s K1 + s + \u03c3q 2 non\u2212dimensionalisation\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 s\u0307 = \u2212 s K + s + \u03c3Q2ref V1 q2,\nwhere K := K1 s0 ,\nwhere the right hand side stated the rescaled non-dimensional s equation. The above choices of reference values lead to the following rescaled version of the q equation:\nq\u0307 = s0 Qref s K + s \u2212 s0 Qref V2 V1\nq K2/Qref + q \u2212 2 s0 Qref \u03c3Q2ref V1 q2. (5)\nA preferable choice for Qref is less obvious. A first idea might be to also chose Qref = s0 like for the other concentrations. However, since DGs are processed by DG hydrolysis and DG transacylation alongside their production from DG hydrolysis, the actual DG concentration q is typically much smaller than s0. In view of this inflowoutflow dynamics of q, another possible choice of an intrinsic reference value Qref could be a value for which inflow and outflow balance, i.e. q\u0307 = 0 holds for a certain amount of substrate s, let\u2019s say initially when s = s0. However, choosing Qref in this way would not apply to all the parameters we would like to analyse. In particular in the absence of transacylation, a value Qref such that q\u0307 = 0 holds only exists when V2 > V1, see Sect. 4. Even in the cases when such a reference value exists, it depends on \u03c3 , which makes a comparison between cases with and without transacylation, i.e. \u03c3 = 0 cumbersome. The same problem occurs when trying to scale the method by the principle of minimum simplification or pairwise comparision, see e.g. Shoffner and Schnell (1989).\nIn this paper,we therefore prefer to setQref = K2,which is independent of transacylation and allows to normalise the Michaelis constant of the DG hydrolysis rate, thus reducing one parameter. Following this choice, we introduce the dimensionless parameter L = s0/K2, which appears in all three terms in (5). Moreover, the dimensionless parameter V = V2/V1 denotes the ratio of the two MM maximal velocities. Finally, the nondimensional transacylation term in (5) features the dimensionless parameter \u03c3K 22/V1, which compares DG transacylation to TG hydrolysis. We prefer to rewrite\nthis parameter as\n\u03c3K 22 V1 = \u03c3K 2 2 V2 V =: \u03baV ,\nwhere we introduce the dimensionless parameter \u03ba = \u03c3K 22/V2. This choice has the advantage, that the dimensionless parameter \u03ba directly compares DG transacylation to DG hydrolysis, thus the two downstream pathways for DG. Altogether, the rescaled model (2) becomes\n\u23a7 \u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\ns\u0307 = \u2212m1(s) + V \u03baq2, q\u0307 = L [ m1(s) \u2212 V ( m2(q) + 2\u03baq2 )] , p\u0307 = V ( m2(q) + \u03baq2 ) ,\nf\u0307 = m1(s) + Vm2(q),\nwhere\n\u23a7 \u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9 m1(s) = sK+s , m2(q) = q1+q , K = K1s0 , L = s0K2 , V = V2V1 , \u03ba = \u03c3K 22 V2 . (6)\nThe model features three positive dimensionless parameters K , L, V > 0 and the non-negative parameter \u03ba \u2265 0 whether transacylation is considered or not. Given the molecular biological background, one would expect that the initial TG concentration s0 is at least not smaller than the Michaelis constants K2 of DG hydrolysis, which suggests L \u2265 1 although we shall not assume this condition. There are also some data (see Kim et al. 2008) suggesting that V2 should be somewhat larger than V1, so that one can maybe expect V \u223c 3, but again we shall not assume this.\nThe scaled initial concentrations become\ns(0) = 1, q(0) = q0 K2 , p(0) = 0 and f (0) = 0 (7)\nand the non-dimensional form of the conservation laws (3) reads as\n3s(t) + 2q(t) L + p(t) + f (t) = 3 + 2q(0) L ands(t) + q(t) L + p(t) = 1 + q(0) L\n(8)\nwhich holds true for all times t \u2265 0. Moreover, p\u221e = 1+q0/s0 and r\u221e = 2+q0/s0.\nPhaseportrait and Global a Priori Bounds\nThe qualitative behaviour of the s \u2212 q system is illustrated by phaseportrait Fig. 3: Given initial data s0 > 0 and assuming q0 sufficiently small in comparison, the TG concentration s decays due to the predominant TG hydrolysis. In the same process, the DG concentration q builds up to a maximum value, before decaying alongside the breakdown of TG. We will discuss later the question under which conditions this coupled decay process can be approximated by a QSSA replacing the q equation. In a second regime for large initial values q0 (compared to s0), transacylation leads to a\ntransient increase of s before again s and q tend to zero in the large time behaviour due to the breakdown of TG and DG.\nThe large time behaviour of the s \u2212q system is addressed by the following lemma:\nLemma 2.1 (Global bounds and exponential decay of TG/DG concentrations) Consider solutions to (6) subject to initial data (7).\nThen, there exist positive constants smax, qmax and C1, C2 such that\nfor each t \u2265 0 : { 0 \u2264 s(t) \u2264 smax, 0 \u2264 q(t) \u2264 qmax, 0 \u2264 s(t), q(t) \u2264 C1e\u2212C2t (9)\nIf additional q(0) is smaller than the value where q\u0307(smax) = 0 holds, then the constant qmax can be chosen independently of L.\nProof The existence of constants smax and qmax follows directly from the mass conservation laws (8) and the non-negativity of s and q, which imply the bounds s(t) \u2264 1 + 2q(0)3 L =: smax and q(t) \u2264 L + q(0). While smax is uniformly bounded in L \u2265 1 this is not true for this bound on q. However, the bound smax allows to estimate\nq\u0307 = L [ m1(s) \u2212 V ( m2(q) + 2\u03baq2 )] \u2264 L [ m1(smax) \u2212 V ( m2(q) + 2\u03baq2 )] .\nDenote by q\u0303(s) the value ofq, where q\u0307 = 0 holds (see Fig. 3). Then, q\u0303(smax) constitutes an upper solution to q provided that q(0) \u2264 q\u0303(smax). Hence, under this additional assumption, we deduce q(t) \u2264 q\u0303(smax) =: qmax, where qmax is now independent of L (and also uniform in large V and \u03ba , cf. Lemma 4.1 below).\nNext, we estimate\nm1(s) = s K + s \u2265\ns K + smax and m2(q) = q 1 + q \u2265 q 1 + qmax .\nLet \u03b1 and \u03b2 be arbitrary numbers such that 0 < \u03b2 < \u03b1 \u2264 2\u03b2. For instance, we can choose \u03b1 = 1 = 2\u03b2. Then,\n(\u03b1Ls + \u03b2q)\u00b7 = \u2212(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2)Lm1(s) \u2212 \u03b2LVm2(q) \u2212 (2\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)LV \u03baq2\n\u2264 \u2212 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u03b1(K + smax)\u03b1Ls \u2212 LV 1 + qmax \u03b2q \u2264 \u2212min {\n\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u03b1(K + smax) , LV 1 + qmax } (\u03b1Ls + \u03b2q) =: \u2212C2 (\u03b1Ls + \u03b2q) ,\nwhere we set C2 = min { \u03b1\u2212\u03b2 \u03b1(K+smax) , LV 1+qmax } . It follows from the Gronwall inequality that\n\u03b1Ls(t) + \u03b2q(t) \u2264 (\u03b1L + \u03b2q(0))e\u2212C2t .\nWe set C1 = max { 1 + \u03b2 \u03b1L q(0), \u03b1L \u03b2 + q(0) } = max { 1, \u03b1L \u03b2 } ( 1 + \u03b2 \u03b1 q0 s0 ) and complete the proof."

            "text": "ATGL is the main TG hydrolase and thus believed to be the key regulator for the lipolytic cascade TG \u2192 DG \u2192 MG. This poses the question if the ability of AGTL to additionally facilitate DG transacylation is of physiological relevance or not?\nThe question of the qualitative role of DG transacylation to our model systems can be viewed from three different perspectives:\n(i) How does DG transacylation effect the processing of the substrate TG? (ii) How does DG transacylation effect the production of the product MG? (iii) How does DG transacylation effect the production of the product FA?\nIn the following, we present numerical simulations of the non-dimensionalised system (6) with MATLAB version 2021b and its built-in ode23s routines. In all plots, we consider initial data consisting only of TG, i.e. s0 = 1 and q0 = p0 = f0 = 0 and fix the parameters L = K = 1. Remark 3.1 We point our that normalising the parameters K and L doesn\u2019t really change the qualitative behaviour of our model system and in particular doesn\u2019t influence the discussion of the qualitative role of DG transacylation. More precisely, K modulates the transition of an approximately constant to an approximately linear Michaelis\u2013Menten rate during the decay of the TGs. Changing K makes no significant qualitative changes to the decay of TGs also since the maximal feedback from DG transacylation is limited by 50%. On the other hand, the parameter L multiplies equally all the processes modelled on the right hand side of the q equation. Hence, changing L doesn\u2019t significantly influence the interplay between the processes of DG production and DG degradation.\nFigure 4 plots in the top row the simulation times, which are needed\u2014depending on values of the parameters V and \u03ba\u2014(i) to process 50% of the initial substrate TG s0, (ii) to produce 50% of the final amount of MG, p\u221e = s0 = 1, and (iii) to produce 50% of the final amount of FA, f\u221e = 2s0 = 2. The axes plot the decimal log of the parameter values (V , \u03ba). Note that the times (ii) and (iii) to produce 50% of p\u221e and f\u221e will always be larger than time i) to process 50% of the initial substrate, which is clearly a requirement for both other times to be reached. The time to produce 50% of p\u221e can be much larger than the one of 50% of f\u221e, since TG hydrolysis can reach the FA target on its own, while in order to reach 50% of p\u221e, either DG transacylation or DG hydrolysis is required.\nThe interpretation of Fig. 4 is far from trivial. For a better understanding we provide the second row in Fig. 4, which plots the relative fraction of the DG transacylation rate to the total rate of DG processing, i.e. 2\u03baq2/(2\u03baq2 + q1+q ) in the same three cases, at the same times and under the same parameters as the top row. Note that thanks to our choice of non-dimensional parameters in Sect. 2, the ratio 2\u03baq2/(2\u03baq2 + q1+q ) only involves the parameter \u03ba yet also depends via the solution q on V . All the images in the second row of Fig. 4 show that DG transacylation is dominant at a level of 90% on the left upper corner. On the other hand, DG hydrolysis is dominant at a level of 90% at the bottom and the extended right lower corner. In the in between area, the contour levels decay horizontally for small levels of V and diagonally for larger values\nof V . The reason for this kink in the contour levels is the change in the values of q in calculating the reaction rates 2\u03baq2 and q1+q , respectively.\nReturning to the interpretation of the top row of Fig. 4, we see in (i) that increasing the value of \u03ba in DG transacylation slows down the processing of the TG substrate. The slowing down effect is the strongest for values of V \u223c 1.\nFor larger value of V , i.e. in the right upper part, the contour lines of equal times follow the contour lines of equal DG fraction in the picture below. Accordingly, the increased TG processing times corresponds in the right upper part to the increase of the dominance of DG transacylation, which provides increasing feedback into the TG pool.\nFor small values of V , however, the contour lines in Fig. 4i do not correspond to the ones in the image below, whichmeans that structure of the DG transacylation feedback changes: In this upper left corner, where DG transacylation is overall dominant and roughly constant, the contour lines in Fig. 4i follow the lines where the parameter product V \u03ba is constant, i.e. log10 \u03ba = C \u2212 log10 V for some constant C . In this part of the image, the increase of the product V \u03ba determines the increase in feedback to the TG pool and the increase in the delay of the 50% TG processing time. Hence, we infer that in this part of the picture, changes in V and \u03ba do not substantially change the values of q. Rather, the increase of the source term V \u03baq2 in the s equation is mainly due to the change in the parameter product V \u03ba . This is different to the right upper area where the contour lines of Fig. 4i follow the contour lines of the image below!\nFigure 4ii shows for small values of \u03ba vertical contour levels as the time needed to produce 50% of MG depends under this conditions entirely on DG hydrolysis and the parameter V . Such vertical contour levels for small values of \u03ba are also shown in Fig. 4iii since DG hydrolysis also contributes to the production of FAs, yet with a much more moderate variation of the values compared to Fig. 4ii since TG hydrolysis is a constant source of FA production. In both images Fig. 4ii and iii, the influence of DG transacylation tilts the contour lines away from the middle for increasing values of\u03ba . In the left upper half of Fig. 4ii, the contour lines followagain the lines log10 \u03ba = C\u2212log10 V for some constantC , which shows howDG transacylation helps in the case of lacking DG hydrolysis to produce MGs and thus lower the time of 50% p\u221e production. The left upper half of Fig. 4iii shows similar contour lines, since DG transacylation provides feedback into the TG pool, fromwhich TG hydrolysis can release additional FAs. However, this DG feedback effects are somewhat more blurred compared Fig. 4ii due to the ongoing TG hydrolysis, which occurs anyway.\nIn the right upper half of Fig. 4ii, the contour lines turn to follow the contour lines in the image below and the production of MGs is actually slowed down by increasing \u03ba and thus DG transacylation. At the first glance, this seems counter intuitive since DG transacylation provides an additional pathway to produce MGs. However, we recall that DG hydrolysis yields one MG out of one DG while DG transacylation results in only 1/2MG. Hence, increased DG transacylation can hinder the twice more efficient production of MGs via DG hydrolysis, which causes the production of MGs to effectively slow down. The left upper half of Fig. 4iii shows again similar contour lines and a similar behaviour as DG transacylation hinders the production of FAs from DG hydrolysis.\nRelative Time Changes Compared to DynamicsWithout DGTransacylation\nFigure 5 shows relative time changes compared to the dynamicswithout transacylation, i.e.\nt\u03ba>0 \u2212 t\u03ba=0 t\u03ba=0 ,\nwhere t\u03ba>0 denotes the simulation times like in the cases (i), (ii), and (iii) of Fig. 4 for positive values of \u03ba and t\u03ba = 0 denotes the corresponding simulation time without DG transacylation (yet all other parameters being the same).\nOn the left, Fig. 5i plots the relative time change with respect to processing 50% of the initial substrate TG s0. For small values of \u03ba , the image show small, positive relative time changes, which corresponds to the small, positive feedback of DG transacylation into the pool of TG delaying the time to have processed 50%. With increasing \u03ba , the delay effect becomes more and more significant reaching up to 70% for values of V 1. The contour lines of Fig. 5i correspond to Fig. 4i, which is an easy consequence of the fact that for \u03ba = 0, the processing time of 50% TG is due to TG hydrolysis alone and thus the same for all values of V .\nThe middle image of Fig. 5ii shows the complexity of the interplay DG transacylation vs. DG hydrolysis. For small values of V , increasing \u03ba leads to DG transacylation becoming dominant and therefore speeding up MG production in Fig. 5ii up to 80% and higher. Here, DG transacylation acts as a by-pass process in order to produce MGs despite lacking DG hydrolysis. A similar speed is shown in Fig. 5iii, where DG transacylation feeds back into the TG pool, from which TG hydrolysis can release additional FAs. In contrast, for larger values of V 1, Fig. 5ii shows that increasing\n\u03ba and DG transacylation results in a substrate competition to DG hydrolysis, which is nevertheless the more efficient process since it produces 1MG out of 1 DG, while DG transacylation yields on 1/2MG. Therefore, the 50%MG production times are slowed down by 40% and more. This is again similar in Fig. 5iii, where DG transacylation hinders the immediate production of a FA by DG hydrolysis (even if TG hydrolysis can later release 1/2 FA form the 1/2 TG produced by DG transacylation).\nEffects of DGTransacylation Depend on the State of the Hydrolytic Machinery\nWe point out the effects of DG transacylation also depend on the current stage within the time evolution of the hydrolytic machinery. Figure 6 plots the relative time changes comparing system (6) with L = K = 1 and \u03ba = 10 to the same system with \u03ba = 0 as function of V and for different percentages x% of TG process and the corresponding percentages (100 \u2212 x)% of MG and FA production.\nFigure 6i plots the slowdown in the TG substrate processing times. For V 1, i.e. under conditions where DG hydrolysis is lacking, the slowdown of TG process is largest for small values of x , i.e. at the beginning of hydrolysis, when DG concentrations are largest and DG transacylation provides therefore the largest feedback into the TG pool. For V 1, i.e. under conditions where DG hydrolysis is present, the effects of DG transacylation and thus the slowdown get smaller and almost independent of x for large values of V .\nFigure 6ii shows for V 1 a strong 80% acceleration of MG production thanks to the MGs produced by DG transacylation, which serves under this conditions as a bypass of the lacking DG hydrolysis. In contrast, for values V 1, Fig. 6ii displays that MG production is slowed down for smallish x = 10, 25, . . ., i.e. at the beginning of hydrolysis. Yet, later in the evolution, when x = 75, 90, the early slow down is not only compensated but MG production is altogether accelerated due to DG transacylation. This example underlines the nonlinear behaviour of the effects of DG transacylation and how they depend on the current state of the hydrolytic machinery. This is important in view of biochemical experiments, in particular when comparing in vitro cell assays experiments to in vivo experiments, where effective DG concentrations are very difficult to determine.\nFigure 6iii shows for values V 1 and smallish x = 10, 25 a very strong speed up of 80% in the FA production time since DG transacylation creates additional TGs, which serve as a substrate for TG hydrolysis and therefore produce additional FAs. However, later in the evolution for x > 50%, there is no noticeable speed up anymore since only 50% of the final FAs come from TG hydrolysis (and in-between DG transacylation). The remaining x-50% of the final FAs can only be produced via DG hydrolysis, which is just as slow as it is.\nOn the other hand, Fig. 6iii shows for values V 1 a slow down effect on FA production from DG transacylation, as it competes with DG hydrolysis for substrate and (after a TG hydrolysis step) yields only half of the FA release compared to DG hydrolysis."

(11)\nHere, we have scaled (w.l.o.g.) the initial TG concentration to one and introduce the function d(q) as a short hand for the sum of the DG hydrolysis and DG transacylation reaction rates in Eq. (11).\nIn this section, we investigate under which conditions system (10)\u2013(11) can be reduced to a simpler model system by means of a quasi-steady-state-approximation (QSSA). QSSAs exploit that some quantities change slowly in time compared to typical time scales of the overall dynamics. Then, a zero order QSSA sets the time derivative of these quantities to zero, thus treating it quasi like for a steady state. From the viewpoint of asymptotic analysis, QSSAs are singularly perturbed ODE problems, see e.g. Holmes (1995), Kuehn (2015) and the many references therein. Hence, approximating slowly changing quantities leads to initial layers (except in the special case where the initial data of the slowly changing quantities already matches their QSSA values), which can be resolved, for instance, by matched asymptotics. More accurate approximations can be obtained by calculating higher order correction terms. Note that (10) can\u2019t qualify for a QSSA since the positive feedback provided by DG transacylation is at most half of TG hydrolysis. Even if DG hydrolysis could be neglected, then the feedback DG transacylation and subsequent TG hydrolysis provides is only like TG \u2192 DG \u21921/2 TG \u2192 1/2 DG \u2026, see Fig. 2.\nHowever, Eq. (11) features a gain and two loss terms (TG hydrolysis vs. DG hydrolysis andDG transacylation), where the loss terms aremonotone increasing in q. Hence, the dynamics of (11) tends to balance gain and loss terms. If this happens sufficiently\nfast, a QSSA is expected to serve as a simplified approximative model replacing (11) by an algebraic equation (and possible higher order correction terms).\nAs a first example, we divide Eq. (11) by L and assume that L is a large parameter. Then, the small parameter \u03b5 = L\u22121 suggests a QSSA \u03b5q\u0307 0 whenever L is sufficiently large. In the following, we will see that also the parameters V and \u03ba yield QSSAs provided they are sufficiently large. In these two cases, one rescales q \u2192 \u03b5q in (11) with either \u03b5 = V\u22121 or \u03b5 = \u03ba\u22121/2, which lead again to a left hand side \u03b5q\u0307 0.\nIn all three cases, system (10)\u2013(11) can be approximated by a zero order QSSA model system by setting \u03b5q\u0307 = 0 and replacing the differential equation (11) by the algebraic equation\nm1(s) V = d(q\u0303) = 2\u03ba q\u03032 + m2(q\u0303), with m2(q\u0303) = q\u0303 1 + q\u0303 , (12)\nwhere the function q\u0303 = q\u0303(s) is the unique positive solution to (12) (recall the monotonicity in q\u0303) as long as it exists. In particular, q\u0303 is not defined when \u03ba = 0 and m1(s) V \u2265 1 which contradicts the bound m2(q\u0303) < 1 for all q\u0303 \u2208 R+. Note, that the explicit solution to the third order polynomial (12) by Cardano\u2019s formula is of little practical use and that we will make use of q\u0303 either implicitly or approximatively.\nThe following Lemma 4.1 states a parameter condition which imply q\u0303 \u2264 1/2 and provides a useful approximation formula of q\u0303 in this case. Note that in practical examples, we expect QSSA levels q\u0303 to be rather small, in particular if V and/or \u03ba are large enough.\nLemma 4.1 (Condition ensuring q\u0303 \u2264 12 and explicit approximation formula) Assume that the parameters (V , \u03ba) satisfy the condition\nV \u2265 4 1 + 2\u03ba \u21d0\u21d2 \u03ba \u2265 2 V \u2212 1 2 . (13)\nFor instance, suppose V \u2265 4 and \u03ba \u2265 0. Then, q\u0303 \u2264 12 holds for all s \u2264 1 and K > 0 and we can approximate (within 10%)\nq\u0303 \u223c 1 V 2\u221a 1 + 4(2\u03ba \u2212 1)/V + 1 = { O( 1V ) if V \u03ba, O( 1\u221a\n2\u03baV ) if V \u03ba. (14)\nProof Since d(q\u0303) is strictly monotone increasing in q\u0303 , the QSSA equation (12), i.e.\nd(q\u0303) = 2\u03ba q\u03032 + q\u0303 1 + q\u0303 = m1(s) V =: I .\nhas a unique positive solution q\u0303 for every input value I > 0. The explicit solution by Cardano\u2019s formula is too cumbersome for practical use. Instead, we derive an approximation formula for sufficiently small q\u0303 , i.e. inputs I . In particular, since d(q\u0303) is monotone increasing, a sufficient condition for q\u0303 \u2264 12 is obtained from estimating m1 V \u2264 1V for all s \u2265 0 and K > 0:\n1 V \u2264 d ( q\u0303 = 1 2 ) = \u03ba 2 + 1 3 , \u21d0\u21d2 \u03ba \u2265 2 V \u2212 2 3 .\nNext, for sufficiently small q\u0303 (to be determined), we can rewrite\nd(q\u0303) = 2\u03ba q\u03032 + q\u0303 \u2212 q\u03032 + q\u0303 3\n1 + q\u0303 = I (15)\nThe last term on the left hand side \u03b4(q\u0303) := q\u030331+q\u0303 will be of lower order for sufficiently small q\u0303 . A formal asymptotic expansion q\u0303 = q\u03030 + \u03b4q\u03031 yields q\u03030 = \u221a 1 + 4I (2\u03ba \u2212 1) \u2212 1\n2(2\u03ba \u2212 1) = 2I\u221a 1 + 4I (2\u03ba \u2212 1) + 1 , q\u03031 = \u2212 1\u221a 1 + 4I (2\u03ba \u2212 1) .\nIn order to make sure that the zero order approximation q\u03030 is real in the cases 0 \u2264 2\u03ba < 1, we enforce 1 > 4I (1\u2212 2\u03ba) by estimating I \u2264 1V independently of s and by imposing the sufficient constraint\n1 V \u2264 1 4 1 1 \u2212 2\u03ba \u2208 [1 4 ,\u221e ) for \u03ba \u2208 [ 0, 1 2 ) . (16)\nNext, we calculate that q\u03030 \u2264 12 implies \u03b4(q\u03030) = q\u030330 1+q\u03030 \u2264 112 . Thus, (15) yields \u03b4(q\u0303) = \u03b4(q\u03030) + O(\u03b4) and thus \u03b4(q\u0303) is of order O(10\u22121). On the other hand, straightforward calculation shows that q\u03030 \u2264 12 is equivalent to I \u2264 (1 + 2\u03ba)/4. Since m1(s) \u2264 1, a sufficient condition which ensures q\u03030 \u2264 12 independently of s and K is given by assumption (13) above. Finally, it is straightforward to check that (13) always implies constraint (16), which completes the proof."

            "text": "A QSSA which approximates \u03b5q\u0307 0 is expected to feature an initial layer whenever the initial data q(0) do not equal the initial values of the approximation q\u0303(s(0)), see e.g. Holmes (1995). Indeed, we expect q\u0307 \u223c O(\u03b5\u22121) during the initial layer except for initial data q(0), which are already O(\u03b5)-close to q\u0303(s(0)).\nHere, it is natural to consider initial data q(0) = 0, i.e. that there is initially no DG, which implies that there is an initial layer behaviour. (Other initial data which are not O(\u03b5)-close to q\u0303(s(0)) can be treated the same.) For a QSSA to be a useful and valid approximation, the initial layer must be short compared to the dynamics which is of interest.\nIn the following,we derive necessary conditions on the parameters aswell as bounds on the shortness of the initial layer. The proximity of q(t) to q\u0303(s(t)) is \u2013 in our opinion \u2013 best studied after rewriting (11) as perturbation \u03c0 around the QSSA variable q\u0303(s(t)), i.e.\nq(t) = q\u0303(s(t)) + \u03c0(t). (17)\nBy using the identities q2 = q\u03032 + \u03c0(2q\u0303 + \u03c0) and m2(q) = m2(q\u0303) + \u03c0(1+q\u0303)(1+q\u0303+\u03c0) , we rephrase the right hand side of (11) as\nq\u0307 = \u2212LV\u03c0 [\n2\u03ba(2q\u0303 + \u03c0) + 1 (1 + q\u0303)(1 + q\u0303 + \u03c0)\n]\n. (18)\nNote that the squared bracket on the r.h.s. is always strictly positive (since q = \u03c0+q\u0303 \u2265 0). Hence, the equality\nsign(q\u0307) = \u2212sign(\u03c0)\nfollows, which is a useful observation. Figure 7 compares the evolution of q(t) from (10) and q\u0303(s(t)) for different values of V : Starting at the initial data without DG, i.e. q(0) = 0 resp. \u03c0(0) = \u2212q\u0303(s(0)), TG hydrolysis yields s(t) to continuously decreases from its starting value s(0) = 1 (not plotted) and q(t) to grow towards a maximal value q(tm) at a time tm > 0 when q\u0307(tm) = 0 holds. Thus (18) implies that\nat tm > 0 holds: q(tm) = q\u0303(s(tm)) =: q\u0303m and \u03c0(tm) = 0. (19)\nAt time tm of maximal DG concentration, the rates of DG hydrolysis and DG transacylation balance exactly TG hydrolysis.\nFor times larger than tm , the DG concentration q(t) decays. Hence, (18) implies \u03c0(t) > 0 for t > tm , which can be interpreted that the decay of the rates of DG hydrolysis and transacylation lags behind the decay of the TG hydrolysis rate caused by the decay of s(t), see also phaseportrait Fig. 3.\nAltogether, Fig. 7 suggests that a QSSA can be used provided that the initial layer interval [0, tm] is sufficiently short and that after tm the perturbation \u03c0(t) is sufficiently small. Figure7 illustrates that we can expect a QSSA for q to hold for sufficiently large values of V . Analog plots can bemade in favour if a QSSA for sufficiently large values of L and \u03ba .\nWe would like to estimate the duration of the initial layer in the following. First, we derive the evolution equation of \u03c0(t). By taking the derivate of (12), we calculate with q\u0303 short for q\u0303(s)\n\u02d9\u0303q = \u02d9\u0303q(s) = m \u2032 1(s)\nVd \u2032(q\u0303) s\u0307,\nwhere we use the formulas:\nm\u20321(s) = K (K + s)2 and d \u2032(q) = 4\u03baq + m\u20322(q) > 0, m\u20322(q) =\n1\n(1 + q)2 , (20)\nBy recalling q\u0307 = \u02d9\u0303q + \u03c0\u0307 , we obtain the evolution equation for \u03c0 :\n\u03c0\u0307 = \u2212LV\u03c0 [\n2\u03ba(2q\u0303 + \u03c0) + 1 (1 + q\u0303)(1 + q\u0303 + \u03c0)\n] \u2212 m \u2032 1(s)\nVd \u2032(q\u0303) s\u0307, (21)\nsubject to the initial data \u03c0(0) = \u2212q\u0303(s(0)) = \u2212q\u0303(1) < 0. The time scales of Eq. (21) are key to understanding necessary conditions for a QSSA. The first term in (21) acts as a stabilising terms and aims to relax \u03c0(t) towards zero (since the square bracket is positive). On the other hand, the second term is always positive (as s\u0307 < 0). Hence, it helps q to reach the maximal level q\u0303(s(tm)) faster, but afterwards becomes a destabilising factor causing \u03c0 > 0 as long as q\u0307 < 0 resp. s\u0307 < 0. Roughly speaking, the second term quantifies the adaptation of the QSSA q\u0303 due to the decay of s.\nAs a first observation, we suppose s\u0307 1 and thus the second term on the right hand side of (21) negligible. Then, linearisation of (21) (i.e. rescaling \u03c0 \u2192 \u03b5\u03c0 and letting \u03b5 \u2192 0), yields indeed exponential stability of \u03c0 = 0:\n\u03c0\u0307 \u2212LV\u03c0 [\n4\u03ba q\u0303 + 1 (1 + q\u0303)2\n]\n= \u2212LVd \u2032(q\u0303) \u03c0, in the case s\u0307 1.\nThe eigenvalue \u2212LVd \u2032(q\u0303) < 0 characterises the linear stability of the QSSA q\u0303(s) provided that the decay of s is negligible.\nRemark 4.1 The fast timescale of classical QSSA for a single substrate - single enzyme reaction is often calculated from the eigenvalue LVd \u2032(q\u0303) (Murray 2002, p. 179), i.e. T = 1/(LVd \u2032(q\u0303)). The same time scale is obtained when using Rice\u2019s scaling by inverse rates to our system, see e.g. Shoffner and Schnell (1989). In the following, we will derive a better estimation of the timescale, see (24) below, which is more specific to our system."

Evaluating \u03c0\u0307 yields\n\u03c0\u0307 | \u03c0=\u2212 q\u0303(s)2 = LV\n[ 3\n2 \u03ba q\u03032 + 1 (2 + q\u0303) q\u0303 (1 + q\u0303) ] + m \u2032 1 Vd \u2032(q\u0303) [ m1 \u2212 V \u03baq2 ] .\nFor the first square bracket, (12) implies the elementary bounds\n1 (2 + q\u0303) m1 V \u2264 3 2 \u03ba q\u03032 + 1 (2 + q\u0303) q\u0303 (1 + q\u0303) \u2264 3 4 m1 V\nwhile for the second square bracket, we obtain\nm1 2 + Vm2 2 \u2264 m1 \u2212 V \u03baq2 \u2264 m1,\nwhere the lower bound follows from q\u0307 > 0 implying 2V \u03baq2 < m1 \u2212 Vm2. Note also that 12+q\u0303 1 2 for small values of q\u0303 , which we expect for large values of V and \u03ba . Hence, we observe that\n\u03c0\u0307 | \u03c0=\u2212 q\u0303(s)2\n\u03c0\u0307 |t=0 + \u03c0\u0307 |t=tm 2\nWe therefore take this average as a typical value of \u03c0\u0307 throughout the initial layer and introduce as a typical time scale for the initial layer the change in q (that is q(tm) \u2212 q(0) = q\u0303(s(tm))) divided by the above typical value of \u03c0\u0307 :\nT := 2q\u0303(s(tm)) \u03c0\u0307 |t=0 + \u03c0\u0307 |t=tm . (24)\nIn the following, we derive for T the more convenient upper bound Tfast in (29) depending only on q\u0303m = q\u0303(tm) = q(tm) and the parameter K . First, since q\u0303d \u2032(q\u0303) = 4\u03ba q\u03032 + q\u0303\n(1+q\u0303)2 , we obtain from (12) the bounds\n1 (1 + q\u0303) m1 V \u2264 4\u03ba q\u03032 + q\u0303 (1 + q\u0303)2 \u2264 2 m1 V\nand therefore\nV q\u0303d \u2032(q\u0303) = \u03b8(q\u0303)m1, where \u03b8(q\u0303) \u2208 [ 1 1 + q\u0303 , 2 ] , \u2200q\u0303 \u2265 0,\nand moreover, \u03b8 \u2208 [ 12 , 2] for q\u0303 \u2264 1. Next, we rewrite T as\nT = 1 T\u221211 + T\u221212 + T\u221213\n(25)\nand identify the terms T1 and T2 in (22) and T3 in (23) using the notations q\u03030 := q\u0303(s(0)) = q\u0303(1) and q\u0303m = q\u0303(s(tm)):\nT1 = 2 m1(s(0)) q\u0303m L = 2(K + 1) q\u0303m L , (26)\nT2 = 2 m\u20321(s(0)) q\u0303m q\u03030 V q\u03030d \u2032(q\u03030) m1(s(0)) = 2(K + 1) 2 K q\u0303m q\u03030 \u03b8, \u03b8(q\u0303) \u2208 [ 1 1 + q\u0303 , 2 ] , (27)\nT3 = 2 m\u20321(s(tm)) q\u0303mV d \u2032(V q\u0303m) m1 \u2212 V \u03ba q\u03032m = 2(K + s(tm)) 2 K \u03b8 \u03c8 , \u03c8 \u2208 [ 12 , 1], (28)\nwhere we have used for T3 in (23) that q\u0303m = q\u0303(tm) = q(tm) and m1 \u2212 V \u03baq2 = \u03c8m1 for some \u03c8 \u2208 [ 12 , 1].\nIn particular, we will estimate (27) and (28) as\nT2 = q\u0303m q\u03030 2(K + 1)2 K \u03b8 \u2264 4(K + 1) 2 K , T3 = 2(K + s(tm)) 2 K \u03b8 \u03c8 \u2264 8(K + 1) 2 K ,\nsince q\u0303m \u2264 q\u03030, \u03b8 \u2264 2 and \u03c8\u22121 \u2264 2. We then obtain the upper bound\nT \u2264 2(K + 1) 2\nL q\u0303m (K + 1) + 34K =: Tfast. (29)\nThe time scales for the initial layer T and its more practical upper bound Tfast have to be compared a time scale representing the decay of the substrate s. Since m12 \u2264 \u2212s\u0307 \u2264 m1 holds during the initial layer (due to q\u0307 > 0 implying 2V \u03baq2 < m1 \u2212Vm2), we choose the Michaelis Menten model s\u0307 = \u2212 34m1(s) to provide a reference time of the decay of s(t). Straightforward integration with s(0) = 1 yields\nK ln(s(t)) + s(t) = 1 \u2212 3 4 t .\nAs comparison for the times scale of the initial layer, we introduce the time T90% when s(T90%) = 910 , which means that at time T90% about 90% of the TG substrate is still to be processed. We calculate\nT90% = 2 15 + 4 3 K ln\n(10\n9\n) 2\n15 (1 + K ). (30)\nA QSSA relies on the separation of times scales. Here we impose that during the fast time scale of the initial layer, at most 10% of the substrate are processed:\nT \u2264 2(K + 1) 2\nL q\u0303m (K + 1) + 34K = Tfast \u2264 T90% = 2 15 (1 + K ) \u21d0\u21d2 L q\u0303m \u2265 15 \u2212 3 4 K K + 1 .\n(31)\nWe state the following Proposition:\nProposition 4.2 As above in (19), denote by tm the time point when q(tm) is maximal, thus satisfying q(tm) = q\u0303m = q\u0303(s(tm)). Assume that the (not explicit, but useful) condition\nL q\u0303m \u2265 15 \u2212 3 4 K K + 1 (32)\nholds. Then, after the time scale bound Tfast of the initial layer has passed, at least 90% of the TO substrate still needs processing. In view of this separation of time\nscales, the QSSA q\u0303 can be considered as a suitable approximation. The weaker, yet even simplified condition\nq\u0303m \u2264 L 15 , (33)\nimplies (32) independently of K . Both conditions (32) and (33) are satisfied either by L being large or by q(tm) = q\u0303m being sufficiently small. Smallness of q\u0303m is implied from V or \u03ba (or both) being sufficiently large as stated in Lemma 4.1. By inserting (33) into (12) and using m1 \u2264 1, we obtain the sufficient conditions\n\u03ba \u2265 15 2L\n( 15\nLV \u2212 1\n1 + L15\n)\n, or V \u2265 1 2\u03baL2 152\n+ 1 1+ 15L\n. (34)\nAltogether, Eqs. (32), (33) and (34) summarise conditions that for L, V and/or \u03ba sufficiently large, the separation of time scales (31) holds and aQSSA of the q equation can be expected.\nProof Condition (32) has been established in (31). It is straightforward to see that (33) implies (32). Finally, (34) follows from elementary calculations. Remark 4.2 Looking back to numerical example Fig. 7, condition (32) for L = 1 = K requires q\u0303m 0.068. This is clearly satisfied for V = 10 where q\u0303m \u223c 0.028, but not for V = 2, where q\u0303m \u223c 0.073. In the latter case, we calculate T90% \u223c 0.26 while (29) yields that Tfast 0.29 and we see that Tfast \u2264 T90% is not satisfied. Nevertheless, when looking at the case V = 2 in Fig. 7, one would think that the QSSA q\u0303 constitutes already a very nice approximation of q after the initial layer. One could suggest to relax the condition Tfast \u2264 T90%, to for instance Tfast \u2264 T84% and calculate analog to above the condition q\u0303 0.11, which is satisfied for V = 2. However, we will elaborate this example further in the discussion and show that one has to be careful with being generous in accepting a QSSA.\nRemark 4.3 We point out that T1 = 2(K +1) q\u0303mL is crucial for deriving condition (31). Without T1, we obtain the contradiction\n2(K + 1)2 3 4K \u2264 2 15 (1 + K ) \u21d0\u21d2 1 + 19 20 K \u2264 0.\nThis is not surprising since T2 and T3 are contributions, which are cause by the adaptation of q\u0303 due to the decay of s(t) and it would be indeed surprising if this feedback alone would enable a sufficiently short initial layer.\nRemark 4.4 From the three large parameters, which allow for QSSAs, the case L large is analog to the classical argument which justifies the Michaelis\u2013Menten QSSA from a large ratio of substrate to enzyme, see e.g. Murray (2002), Shoffner and Schnell (1989).\nThe cases V and \u03ba large are related, but also different in the sense that a large downstream rate (either V2 V1 or \u03c3K 22 V1, see (6)) implies that the maximal values of q are small and thus quickly reached after a short initial layer, altogether allowing to replace q by its QSSA q\u0303 ."

However, the feedback from q\u0303(s\u0303(t)) to the evolution of s\u0303 in (36) is rather weak (recall m12 \u2264\u2212s\u0307 \u2264 m1) and was therefore neglected for the sake of clarity in the derivation the conditions of Proposition 4.2, which are anyway not sharp.\nIn the following, we improve the the approximative quality of the zero order QSSA system (36) by deriving higher order corrections. We will first consider the case of large L and later the cases of large V and \u03ba .

One could think that s0 should be significantly larger than a realistic value K2, which would be in favour of considering L large. However, this is not so clear since ATGL and HSL are assumed bound to the surface of lipid droplets, the TG substrate which is actually available might need to be also near the surface. So effectively, the available s0 might not be larger than K2.\nWith \u03b5 = 1L being a small parameter, we rewrite the q equation of (35) as\n\u03b5q\u0307 = m1(s) \u2212 Vd(q), where d(q) = 2\u03baq2 + q 1 + q .

Straightforward (and somewhat lengthy) calculations show that the following asymptotic expansion of q:\nq = q0 + q1 + q2 + q3 + O(1/V 4) = 0 + m1(s)\nV + m1(s) V 2\n(\n\u2212(2\u03ba \u2212 1)m1(s) + 1L m \u2032 1(s)\n)\n+ m1(s) V 3\n( 4 \u2212 9\u03ba\nL m\u20321(s)m1(s) + (2(2\u03ba \u2212 1)2 \u2212 1)m21(s) + m\u2032\u20321(s)m1(s) + (m\u20321(s))2 L2\n)\n+ O(1/V 4) (49)\nRemark 5.2 Note that in the asymptotics of large V , the zero order approximation q0 = 0, which follows from expanding the rescaled system (46), but could have already been see from the q equation in (35): There, for large V follows already that q = O( 1V ) holds.\nFigure 9 plots q(t) as part of the solution of (35) and shows in comparison the approximations by q1, q1 + q2 and q1 + q2 + q3 given by (49) for parameters L = K = \u03ba = 1 and where s(t) is part of the solution of (35). We see that already for V = 3, the solution q and the third order approximation q1 +q2 +q3 are in very good agreement after the initial layer, while this is not really true for the first and second order approximation. Even better approximation is obtained for larger values of L ."

            "text": "Intracellular lipolysis is a central metabolic pathway involved in a variety of cellular processes including energy production, signal transduction, and lipid remodelling. The main lipolytic enzymes (i.e. ATGL, HSL, and MGL) have been functionally characterised in great detail. Over the last decades, gain- and loss-of-function studies in differentmodel organisms corroborated their crucial roles in neutral lipid catabolism (Grabner et al. 2021; Schreiber et al. 2019). Nevertheless, lipolysis is far from being completely understood.We are convinced that the classical view of lipolysis as a linear process involving the consecutive action of ATGL, HSL, and MGL is too simplistic. On the one hand, published data suggest that lipolysis is an enzymatically redundant process (ATGL not only hydrolyses TGs but also DGs (Zimmermann et al. 2004), vice versa HSL not only hydrolyses DGs but also TGs and MGs (Fredrikson et al. 1981)). On the other hand, three independent studies convincingly showed that ATGL also exhibits DG transacylation activity at least in vitro (Jenkins et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2019; Kulminskaya et al. 2021), indicating that intracellular lipolysis is a non-linear process. The in vivo relevance of DG transacylation is still elusive though.\nKinetic parameters of model system (6) are currently not available. In particular, the parameters \u03ba and V for DG transacylation and DG hydrolysis are unknown since these two functions can not be distinguished by any current experimental protocol. In a work in progress, we are developing mathematical approaches to identify kinetic parameters from experimental data using minimisation of tracking functional as well as Bayesian estimators. First preliminary results of parameter identification (yet for more specific mathematical models than system (6)) suggest values of \u03ba and V , which put the system dynamics somewhere near the middle of the parametric plots Figs. 4 and 5.Aplausible guess suggestsV somewhat larger that one andDG transacylation on average maybe 20% of DG hydrolysis, but with a strong dependence on the substrate and an increase up to 50% in some experiments.\nFor these parameter values, the effects of DG transacylation as shown in Fig. 5 are rather neutral: A slight delay in substrate processing time but negligible effects on the time of MG and FA production compared to the system without DG transacylation. This might be a reason why some researchers believe that DG transacylation does not play a significant role in vivo: Not because it is not active, but because it behaves rather neutrally.\nHowever, if the hydrolytic machinery is shifted away from these conditions, DG transacylation will play a more significant role. First, if DG hydrolysis is lacking, DG transacylation serves as a failsafe mechanism by producing MGs and even indirectly FAs when TGs formed are hydrolysed further to DGs. However, this failsafe mechanism comes at a price: If DGhydrolysis is present, a highly effectiveDG transacylation will compete with DG hydrolysis. This will cause downstream delays by forcing the lipolysis cascade TG \u2192 DG \u2192 MG rather into a semi-open loop of TG \u2192 DG \u2192 1/2 TG \u2192 1/2 DG \u2192 1/4 TG etc, see e.g. Fig 5 and its illustration of the downstream delays.\nIt seems highly remarkable that our current preliminary guess on parameter values places the kinetics of the lipolyticmachinery in themiddle of these twooptions: failsafe mechanism versus DG substrate competition. One can speculate that the lipolytic machinery evolved to operate at a flexible state rather than at the maybe more efficient state without DG transacylation. We interpret our observations that there is biological purpose behind both DG hydrolysis and DG transacylation constituting the lipolysis machinery.\nAs a second biological purpose, we can speculate that various effects of DG transacylation have the ability to homogenise the process of lipid hydrolysis over the surface of lipid droplets.We recall that the ratio of DG transacylation to DG hydrolysis depends on the DG concentration levels and that DG transacylation becomes dominate for sufficiently large concentrations of DGs. The enzyme localisation on the surface of LDs can be temporally and spatially heterogeneous (Egan et al. 1992; Granneman et al. 2009; Sztalryd et al. 2003). Local absence of HSL would lead to local DG accumulation as DGs can\u2019t leave the LD. It can by speculated that DG transacylation may serve as a regulator of spatial heterogeneities of DG concentrations on the surface of the lipid droplet by processing local surpluses (and without having to wait for diffusion to spread DGs). Hence, DG transacylation would contribute to an overall more homogeneous and controlled downstream processing, which is certainly an important physiological factor. However, ATGL-mediated DG transacylation averaged over the\nentire surface of the lipid droplet cannot fully compensate for complete HSL deficiency in vivo, since HSL knockout mice accumulate DGs in adipose and non-adipose tissues (Haemmerle et al. 2002).\nThere are many potential directions of future research. From a mathematical perspective, a rigorous proof of the convergence of the fast-slow ODE systems to the limitingQSSA is work in progress. The proof requires a sufficiently sharp perturbation argument for nonlinear, non-autonomous ODE systems. Unfortunately, estimations of the fundamental matrix of non-autonomous systems like in Teschl (2012, Chapter 3) are currently insufficient, which we strongly consider to be a technical artefact rather than the results of the system behaviour. As a by-pass, we are currently trying to find a suitable change of variables, which might allow to improve the estimates on the non-autonomous semigroup.\nFrom a modelling and interdisciplinary perspective, a central goal is the identification of the lipolytic kinetic parameters from experimental data. In particular, we aim to understand the dynamics of TG breakdown in adipocytes via cell-based assays and mice experiments. However, we will have to work with a limited number of data points both in adipocyte cell assays and even less in mice experiments. We expect that reduced QSSA models like presented in Sect. 5 will be important in order to fit parameter from in vivo data.\nThere is, however, an additional mathematical question concerning the use of QSSAs. As part of the process of mathematical modelling, a sensitivity analysis of the parameter is an important step. In particular, we are studying parameter sensitivity derivatives and how they evolve along solutions of the system. Parameter sensitivity derivatives provided very useful insights into the qualitative behaviour of the system and also into how challenging the inverse problem of identifying parameters from measurements will be.\nIn the spirit of this paper, which is to discuss the role of DG transacylation, the following system considers the sensitivity derivatives with respect to the parameter \u03ba:\n\u23a7 \u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\n( ds\nd\u03ba\n)\u00b7 = \u2212m\u20321(s) ds\nd\u03ba + Vq2 + 2V \u03baq dq d\u03ba ,\n( dq\nd\u03ba\n)\u00b7 = L ( m\u20321(s) ds\nd\u03ba \u2212 2Vq2 \u2212 V (m\u20322(q) + 4\u03baq ) dq d\u03ba\n)\n,\n( dp\nd\u03ba\n)\u00b7 = V ( q2 + (m\u20322(q) + 2\u03baq ) dq\nd\u03ba\n)\n,\n( d f\nd\u03ba\n)\u00b7 = ( m\u20321(s) ds\nd\u03ba + Vm\u20322(q)\ndq\nd\u03ba\n)\n,\n(54)\nsubject to homogeneous initial data\nds\nd\u03ba \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 t=0 = dq d\u03ba \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 t=0 = dp d\u03ba \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 t=0 = d f d\u03ba \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 t=0 = 0.\nNote that, for instance, if dsd\u03ba is positive, then the dynamics observed for increased values of \u03ba will show also increased values of s.\nIn Sect. 5, we have derived simplified QSSAs models. An interesting questions compares the parameter sensitivity derivatives of the full system (54) with the the parameter sensitivity derivatives obtained from the QSSA. Note that, the QSSA q\u0307 = 0 implies (dq/d\u03ba)\u00b7 = 0 and, thus, (dq/d\u03ba) = 0 for all times. Hence, from the second equation in (54) we obtain an algebraic equation for the sensitivity of q\u0303 with respect to \u03ba\ndq\u0303 d\u03ba = 1 \u03bc(q\u0303) ( m\u20321(s\u0303) V ds\u0303 d\u03ba \u2212 2q\u03032 ) , where \u03bc(q\u0303) := m\u20322(q\u0303) + 4\u03ba q\u0303 > 0. (55)\nWe remark that (55) follows equally from differentiating (12) with respect to \u03ba . By substituting (55) into the equation for ds/d\u03ba , we get in the QSSA system that\n( ds\u0303\nd\u03ba\n)\u00b7 = \u2212m\u20321(s\u0303) (\n1 \u2212 2\u03ba q\u0303 \u03bc(q\u0303)\n) ds\u0303\nd\u03ba + V q\u03032\n(\n1 \u2212 4\u03ba q\u0303 \u03bc(q\u0303)\n)\n= \u2212m\u20321(s\u0303) 2\u03ba q\u0303 + m\u20322(q\u0303)\n\u03bc(q\u0303)\nds\u0303 d\u03ba + V q\u03032m\n\u2032 2(q\u0303)\n\u03bc(q\u0303)\nSince initially at t = 0, we have ds\u0303/d\u03ba = 0 and q\u0303 > 0, we obtain from the above equation using m2(q\u0303) = 1/(1 + q\u0303)2\n( ds\u0303\nd\u03ba )\u00b7 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 t=0 =\nV q\u03032\n1 + 4\u03ba q\u0303(1 + q\u0303)2 > 0\nTherefore, ds\u0303/d\u03ba grows initially until the negative linear term starts to dominate and ds\u0303/d\u03ba decays but remains nevertheless positive for all times. Moreover, in the QSSA system (36), the conservation law (8) is reduced to\n\u02d9\u0303s + \u02d9\u0303p = 0.\nHence, differentiation shows\nd p\u0303 d\u03ba = \u2212 ds\u0303 d\u03ba ,\nwhich implies that d p\u0303/d\u03ba is negative for all times, initially decreases until eventually approaches 0, see Fig. 11.\nFigure 11 plots the parameter sensitivity derivatives ds\u0303/d\u03ba and d p\u0303/d\u03ba of theQSSA model for the parameters L = K = 1 and \u03ba = 16, which illustrates this analysis for different values of V = 0.1, 1, 2, 10.\nIn comparison, Fig. 12 plots the evolution of the \u03ba-sensitivity derivatives for the full system (54) for parameters L = K = 1, \u03ba = 16 and the same values of V = 0.1, 1, 2, 10.We observe that the qualitative behaviour of dsd\u03ba and ds\u0303 d\u03ba corresponds well. However, in the cases V = 0.1, 1, 2, the product sensitivity derivative dpd\u03ba of the full system (54) is positive for some initial time interval. This is in contrast to our analysis of the QSSA system, where d p\u0303d\u03ba = \u2212 ds\u0303d\u03ba \u2264 0 holds. For the full system (54), the differentiated conservation law (8), i.e. dsd\u03ba + dqd\u03ba + dpd\u03ba = 0 allows for dpd\u03ba > 0 as long as dqd\u03ba is sufficiently negative, see Fig. 12.\nHence, there are parameters for which the full system predicts an increase of MG production due to increased DG transacylation when the QSSA system predicts a decrease of MG production due to increased DG transacylation. In particular, this contradiction is observed for parameter value V \u2264 2, where for V = 2 Fig. 7 plots (for the same parameters L = K = 1 and \u03ba = 16) a seemingly very good approximation of q by q\u0303 .\nThis example of disagreement between full and QSSA model suggests that an analysis of validity of a QSSA should also include the sensitivity derivatives. Note that already for the classical Michaelis\u2013Menten QSSA analysis, it is known that there are parameter regions where a QSSA can\u2019t be validated, see Eilertsen et al. (2022). In our current paper, Proposition 4.2 identifies parameter conditions, which are necessary for a QSSA, but we do not provide an analysis which shows that these conditions are sufficient. Such a theorem is significantly beyond the scope of the this paper and left for future works.\nAcknowledgements This work is supported by SFB Lipid Hydrolysis (F 73) funded by the Austrian Science Fund FWF, by the International Research Training Group IGDK 1754 and NAWI Graz.
