    "abstractText": "Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) localization refers to the problem of determining the position of each of the agents in a WSN using noisy measurement information. In many cases, such as in distance and bearing-based localization, the measurement model is a nonlinear function of the agents\u2019 positions, leading to pairwise interconnections between the agents. As the optimal solution for the WSN localization problem is known to be computationally expensive in these cases, an efficient approximation is desired. In this paper, we show that the inherent sparsity in this problem can be exploited to greatly reduce the computational effort of using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for large-scale WSN localization. In the proposed method, which we call the Low-Bandwidth Extended Kalman Filter (LB-EKF), the measurement information matrix is converted into a banded matrix by relabeling (permuting the order of) the vertices of the graph. Using a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, it is shown that typical WSN configurations (which can be modeled as random geometric graphs) can be localized in a scalable manner using the proposed LB-EKF approach.",

            "text": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are interconnected agents that sense and navigate their environment, where the interconnections can model various aspects of the WSN, such as the ability of two agents to sense, influence, or communicate with each other. Many real-world systems can be abstracted as WSNs, including groups of autonomous vehicles and fleets of ground-based rovers. WSN localization refers to the problem of accurately estimating the position of each of the agents by processing noisy measurement data.\nIn many WSN applications, the agents are able to obtain relative measurements between their states, such as in the case of inter-agent distance measurements (e.g., using time difference of arrival) or relative bearing measurements (e.g., using cameras) [13, 27, 32]. Moreover, if the agents are equipped with communication capabilities, the received signal strength (RSS) values of the communication links can be used as relative measurements, which is a lowcost approach for WSN localization [20]. Relative measurements are especially useful when the agents are in a GNSS-denied area, or when some of them are being subject to GNSS-spoofing attacks. In such cases the relative measurements can serve as redundant, reliable sources of information that can localize the WSN as well as help to detect sensor faults\n\u2217S. Khan, I. Hwang and J. Goppert are with the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA (e-mail:shiraz@purdue.edu; ihwang@purdue.edu; jgoppert@purdue.edu)\nand spoofing attacks. Assuming that these relative measurements are available between any two agents which are within some given distance of each other, the WSN can be represented using a geometric graph (also called a disk graph) [22]. The problem of WSN localization on geometric graphs using relative measurements has been shown to be NP-hard [1]. Thus, much academic effort has gone into developing efficient state estimation algorithms which can solve this problem approximately.\nClassical approaches for WSN localization like maximum likelihood estimation require a semidefinite programming relaxation before they can be implemented efficiently [30]. A drawback of classical state estimation algorithms is that they only track the state estimate, whereas Bayesian estimators (such as those based on Kalman filtering theory) estimate the covariance of the estimation error as well. The error covariance is valuable for control and decision applications, such as checking for sensor faults using a residual test [16]. Another advantage of Kalman filterbased approaches is that they have provable convergence guarantees, which is not the case for classical estimators that only guarantee the asymptotic consistency of the estimate [25,28]. The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) algorithms are two of the most commonly used Kalman filter-based approaches which can accommodate nonlinear measurement models. While there has been extensive research in the application of EKF to problems having a low-dimensional state vector, e.g., using consensus or diffusion-based strategies [18], these\nar X\niv :2\n30 8.\n00 27\n4v 1\n[ ee\nss .S\nY ]\n1 A\nug 2\n02 3\nalgorithms are not applicable for large-scale WSN localization, which has a high-dimensional state vector. Moreover, estimation algorithms for low-dimensional problems have been made computationally efficient by specializing to geometric graphs [8]. On the other hand, EKF-based approaches for WSN localization in the literature do not exploit graph theory [3, 26]. The authors of [17] note that the computational complexity of a large-scale implementation of the EKF is governed by the error covariance update step, which involves large matrix inversion operations. The complexity of the covariance update step can be reduced by exploiting the sparsity of the matrices involved in its computation. Specifically, matrices having a small bandwidth (i.e., having all of their non-zero elements close to the main diagonal) are highly efficient for scientific computing and memory access [2,14,19]. In [17], the authors design a Kalman filter for largescale applications by assuming that the measurement information matrix has a small bandwidth. However, the foregoing assumption is not satisfied in general, so the algorithm in [17] is not suitable for large-scale WSN localization.\nIn this paper, we develop a novel approach for localizing large-scale WSNs in a scalable manner by leveraging the inherent sparsity of the problem. In the proposed approach, called the L-Banded Extended Kalman Filter (LB-EKF), the sparsity pattern of the measurement information matrix is modified by relabeling (or reordering) the vertices of the graph. We show that when the graph being relabeled is a geometric graph, there exist vertex relabelings which greatly reduce the bandwidth of the measurement information matrix, thereby reducing the computational complexity of WSN localization; an efficient vertex relabeling algorithm which achieves this bandwidth-reduction is proposed as well. Furthermore, we derive an upper bound on the bandwidth of typical WSN configurations, which are modeled as random geometric graphs [15]. Through a numerical example of distance-based WSN localization, it is shown that the vertex relabeling step makes LB-EKF efficient and scalable, while retaining the performance characteristics of the EKF algorithm.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows; Section 2 introduces the mathematical description of the WSN. Section 3 develops the EKF-based solution to the WSN localization problem. In Sections 4.1 and 4.2, the concepts of matrix and graph bandwidths are introduced, and it is shown how they can be exploited to make the EKF algorithm scalable. Sections 4.3 and 4.4 establish bounds on the performance of the proposed vertex relabeling approach on geometric graphs and random geometric graphs, respectively. Finally, Section 5 uses numerical simulations to validate the analysis in the preceding sections.\nNotation: Throughout the paper, | \u00b7 | denotes the\nabsolute value of a number as well as the cardinality of a set.

The vector vi(k) is denoted as such because it represents the agent\u2019s velocity integrated over the discretization period. The noise pi(k) can capture a variety of uncertainties in the knowledge of vi(k), as well as environmental disturbances such as wind gusts. The single-integrator system model is commonly used in this literature [31, 32], as in many real world applications, an informative estimate of the velocity can be obtained using intrinsic sensors with high sampling rates, such as Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), so that the estimation of the velocity may be decoupled from the estimation of the position in order to keep the notation and analysis concise.\nIn order to model nonlinear measurements between the agents, such as inter-agent distance, received signal strength (RSS) and/or relative bearing measurements, we introduce the function \u03d5 : Rd \u00d7Rd \u2192 Rm, which is assumed to be differentiable almost everywhere. For instance, in the case of distance measurements, we can define \u03d5(xi(k), xj(k)) := \u2225xi(k) \u2212 xj(k)\u2225. In order to ensure that the collective state vector x(k) is observable, we assume that a subset of the vertices B \u2286 V, referred to as the set of beacons, can observe their own state (e.g., using GPS measurements). Without loss of generality, let these be the first |B| vertices in V. The measurement model of the agents can be collectively written as\ny(k) = h(x(k)) + [ q(k) r(k) ] (5)\nx1(k)\nx2(k)\n...\nx|B|(k)\n...\n\u03d5(xi(k), xj(k))\n...\n \n  h(x(k)) := (i, j) \u2208 E d|B | en tries m |E|\nen tries\nwhere q(k) \u2208 Rd|B| and r(k) \u2208 Rm|E| are the measurement noise vectors, which are sampled from independent zero-mean white Gaussian noise processes having covariances \u03c3qId|B| and \u03c3rIm|E|, respectively. The existence of one or more beacons (sometimes called anchors) is a standard assumption in literature. For example, a necessary condition for observability in the case of distance-based localization in 2 dimensions (i.e., d = 2) is known to be |B| \u2265 2, as this \u2018pins\u2019 the estimates of two of the agents, preventing any continuous rigid motions of the entire network [31]. More generally, we make the following assumption.\nAssumption 2 (Observability). The system (4), (5) satisfies the observability rank condition given in [28] on some dense set O \u2286 Rd|V| containing x(0) in its interior. Concisely, this states that for all points x\u2032 \u2208 O, the observability matrix constructed using the Jacobian of h(\u00b7) at x\u2032 is full rank.\nIt should be noted that in certain applications, Assumption 2 can be checked in a fast, scalable manner. For instance, in distance or bearing-based localization in 2-dimensions, Assumption 2 simplifies to purely combinatoric properties of the graph (called as the infinitesimal rigidity condition in the literature) which can be checked in polynomial time (with respect to |V|) [31,32]."

            "text": "The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is a widely-used state estimation algorithm which is based on an improvement upon the linearized Kalman Filter, and is able to accomodate nonlinearities in the state and/or measurement models. Moreover, the EKF achieves the Crame\u0301r-Rao lower bound of the localization problem if it is linearized about the true trajectories of the agents [29]. Since the true trajectories are not available in practice, the EKF is instead linearized about the estimated positions. Thus, its performance is asymptotically close to the lower bound. Given Assumption 2 and some mild regularity conditions, it can be shown that the EKF estimate (almost surely) converges exponentially fast to a neighborhood of this\nasymptotic value [25]. In the WSN localization problem, the asymptotic error is dictated by the linearization error of the measurement model (7), which in turn depends on the second-order term in the Taylor series expansion of \u03d5(\u00b7, \u00b7). In order to implement the centralized EKF, the collective measurement function h(x(k)) must be linearized.

The initial estimate of the EKF x\u0302(0) must be chosen to be sufficiently close to x(0) to ensure that the algorithm converges [25]. The estimate of the estimation error covariance at timestep k is denoted as Mk, which can be initialized as\nM0 := E [( x\u0302(0)\u2212 x(0) )( x\u0302(0)\u2212 x(0) )\u22a4]\nMk is updated at each timestep k \u2265 1, using\nPk = Mk\u22121 + \u03c3pId|V| (10)\nMk = ( P\u22121k + Sk )\u22121 (11)\nwhich are the same as the estimation error covariance update equations of the Kalman filter, with the key\ndistinction being that the measurement information matrix Sk depends on x\u0302(k), so thatMk is only an estimate of, and not the true estimation error covariance of the EKF.

This is because the pairwise measurements \u03d5(\u00b7, \u00b7) cause the agents\u2019 estimation errors to be coupled, leading to non-zero off-diagonal blocks in the covariance matrices. The complexity of inverting the matrices in (10) and (11) using general matrix inversion algorithms is O((d|V|)3) [5]. Thus, it is of interest to explore the sparsity patterns of the matrix sequences {Pk} and {Mk} to determine when and how they can be inverted more efficiently for large-scale implementations.\n4.1 Approximation of {Mk} as Banded Matrices\nThe bandwidth of a matrix is defined as follows [21].\nDefinition (Bandwidth of a matrix). The bandwidth of an n\u00d7 n matrix A is\nBandwidth(A) = max Aij \u0338=0\n(|i\u2212 j|) (13)\nNote that Bandwidth(A) counts how far the non-zero entries of A are from its main diagonal, as\n|i\u2212 j| > Bandwidth(A)\u21d2 Aij = 0 (14)\nWhen the matrix A has a small bandwidth, we say that it is a banded matrix. The complexity of many matrix operations reduces considerably when restricted to symmetric banded matrices [14, 19], which are also faster to store and access from memory [2].\nTo ensure that the matrices in {Pk} and {Mk} are banded matrices, we need the following assumption.\nAssumption 3. The initial estimates of the agents\u2019 positions are uncorrelated, i.e., M0 is a block diagonal matrix.\nGiven Assumption 3, M0 is a banded matrix with the bandwidth d \u2212 1. To proceed by induction, suppose that Mk\u22121 is a banded matrix. From (10), it is observed that Pk has the same sparsity pattern as Mk\u22121, and thus, P \u22121 k can be approximated as a banded matrix. If Sk also has a small bandwidth, then the covariance update step in (11) is the inversion of a banded matrix as well, ensuring that every matrix in the sequence {Mk} has a small bandwidth. Given some number L \u2208 N, consider the EKF algorithm which uses the approximated error covariance matrix sequence {M\u0306\u22121k } in its computation, where\nBandwidth(M\u0306\u22121k ) = L\nHere, M\u0306\u22121k is chosen as the matrix of bandwidth L which minimizes the information loss between M\u22121k and itself. Such a matrix is unique, and can be computed using the L-banded matrix inversion algorithm introduced in [14] and [17], summarized in Algorithm 1, where the notation Amn denotes the (n \u2212 m) \u00d7 (n \u2212 m) principle submatrix of the matrix A spanning from row m to row n, and from column m to column n. The computation of M\u0306\u22121k requires the inversion of L \u00d7 L matrices, which is a significant reduction in complexity from general matrix inversion when L \u226a |V| [14, Section 3]. We call this approach the L-Banded Extended Kalman Filter (LB-EKF), summarized in Algorithm 2, which is a family of estimation algorithms parameterized by L.\nAlgorithm 1 L-Banded Matrix Inversion Require: A \u2208 Rn\u00d7n, L \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , n\u2212 1} 1: Initialize a matrix of all zeros, as Z \u2190 0 2: for l = 1 to n\u2212 L do 3: Zll+L \u2190 Zll+L + (All+L)\u22121 4: end for 5: for l = 2 to n\u2212 L do 6: Zll+L\u22121 \u2190 Zll+L\u22121 \u2212 (All+L\u22121)\u22121 7: end for 8: return Z, which is the L-banded approximation\nof A\u22121\nWhen L = 0, the approximated covariances {M\u0306k} are diagonal matrices; when L = 1, they are tridiagonal matrices, and so on. When L = d|V| \u2212 1, {M\u0306k} = {Mk}, i.e., the LB-EKF coincides with the EKF. The authors of [17] remark that the sequence {M\u0306\u22121k }may diverge when L is chosen to be too small, so it should be chosen to be large enough, with its exact value depending on the model matrices as well as the labeling of the WSN."

Thus, the main challenge in making the EKF recursion efficient is in ensuring that Sk is a banded matrix. The bandwidth of Sk can be reduced by exploiting the properties of G, the underlying geometric graph of the WSN. To this end, the following definition of the minimal bandwidth of a graph is introduced.\nDefinition (Minimal bandwidth of a graph). Let \u03a0 be the set of bijections from V to V, such that\n\u03a0 = {\u03c0 | \u03c0 : V \u2192 V, \u03c0(\u00b7) is a bijection} (15)\nThe minimal bandwidth of a graph G = (V, E)) is defined as\n\u03c6min(G) = min \u03c0\u2208\u03a0 ( max (i,j)\u2208E (|\u03c0(i)\u2212 \u03c0(j)|) )\n(16)\nIn the foregoing definition, the bijection \u03c0 is a relabeling of the graph\u2019s vertices. Corresponding to each relabeling \u03c0, there is a unique permutation matrix P\u03c0, such that the Laplacian matrix of G becomes P\u03c0LP\u22a4\u03c0 after the relabeling. Thus, we see that the notions of bandwidth for matrices and graphs are related as follows.\n\u03c6min(G) = min P\u03a0\n( Bandwidth(P\u03c0LP\u22a4\u03c0 ) ) (17)\nwhere P\u03a0 is the set of all |V|\u00d7|V| permutation matrices, and the minimum is taken over the bandwidths of all matrices that are permutation-similar to L. In the literature, \u03c6min(G) is simply referred to as the bandwidth of the graph G [23]. However, we call it the minimal bandwidth in order to avoid any confusion between the two definitions of bandwidth. The bandwidth of a graph refers to the bandwidth of its Laplacian matrix, which may or may not be minimal (i.e., equal to \u03c6min(G)) depending on how the graph\u2019s vertices are labeled.\nOur interest in connecting these two definitions of bandwidth comes from the following proposition.\nLemma 1. The matrix S (2) k in (9) has the same sparsity pattern as L \u2297 1d, where 1d is the d \u00d7 d matrix where each entry is 1.\nProof. Partition S (2) k into d\u00d7 d blocks, and consider the ijth block. When i = j the block is non-zero in general. For i \u0338= j, the ijth block corresponds to the vertex pair (i, j) \u2208 V \u00d7 V, and has the form\n1\n\u03c3r\n\u2211\nl\n( \u03b4hl \u03b4xi )\u22a4 \u03b4hl \u03b4xj\nwhich is only non-zero if there is an entry in h(x) that depends on both xi and xj . This happens precisely when (i, j) \u2208 E . Using the definition of L in (1), we see that the blocks of S\n(2) k have the sparsity pattern\nof L. \u25a0\nNote that the bandwidth of Sk is dictated by the bandwidth of S (2) k , as S (1) k is a diagonal matrix. Using Proposition 1 and a simple counting argument, we have\nBandwidth(Sk) = d ( Bandwidth(L) + 1 ) \u2212 1 (18)\nThus, the complexity of implementing LB-EKF scales with the bandwidth of the Laplacian matrix L, which in turn depends on how the vertices of the graph G are labeled. Unfortunately, for any given graph, there exists a labeling such that the Laplacian matrix has maximal bandwidth, which is |V| \u2212 1 (corresponding to the case where agent 1 is connected to agent n \u2212 1), so the bandwidth of Sk can be arbitrarily large. This makes the problem of finding a good relabeling of V an important sub-problem for large-scale WSN localization."

            "text": "Naturally, the most desirable labeling of the WSN agents is the one that corresponds to the minimal bandwidth of the corresponding graph. Much effort has gone into finding efficient algorithms for finding the minimal bandwidth of a graph, which is known to be an NP-complete problem even when restricted to geometric graphs [7, Theorem 3.1]. Instead, heuristic approaches are used in practice, such as the Reverse Cuthill-McKee [2] and Embed and Project [23] algorithms, amongst others [21]. Since these algorithms do not exploit the properties of geometric graphs, we propose a novel low-complexity algorithm for reducing the bandwidth of geometric graphs, called the vertex relabeling algorithm, and obtain an upper bound on the resulting bandwidth. To arrive at the algorithm, note that a relabeling of the vertices of a geometric graph corresponds to a map from points in Rd onto integers on the number line. This suggests that one can choose a suitable line in Rd and project the positions of the agents onto this line. In the absence of any additional heuristics about the sensor network configuration, we can simply choose the x-axis as this line. Combining these\nideas gives us the vertex relabeling algorithm (Alg. 3). As the algorithm only involves a sorting operation, its complexity is O ( |V| log(|V|) ) [5].\nAlgorithm 3 Vertex Relabeling (VR) Algorithm for Geometric Graphs\nRequire: A realization (G,X ) of a geometric graph.\n1: Sort the vertices in V in increasing order of the x-coordinates of x\u0303i. Resolve any ties by sorting as per their y-coordinate, and so on. 2: return The reordered vertex set V\u03c0.\nIt remains to be justified that Algorithm 3 is indeed effective in reducing the bandwidth of a general geometric graph. Let the bandwidth achieved by the vertex relabeling algorithm (Alg. 3) on a geometric graph G be denoted as \u03c6(G,X ). Here, X is the set of positions of the agents. It can be noted that \u03c6(G,X ) = \u03c6min(G) for the graphs in Fig. 1. More generally, a useful bound on the performance of Algorithm 3 on geometric graphs can be derived as follows.\nTheorem 1 (Upper bound of \u03c6(G,X )). The bandwidth achieved by Algorithm 3 on a geometric graph of sensing radius r, G = (V, E), has the following upper bound:\n\u03c6(G,X ) \u2264 max a\u2208R\n( |X \u2229 Rx(a, a+ r)| )\n=: \u03c6max(X , r) (19)\nwhere Rx(a1, a2) := [a1, a2]\u00d7 Rd\u22121.\nProof. Recall that \u03c6(G,X ) is the bandwidth of the Laplacian matrix of the graph after vertex relabeling. When G is the subgraph of another graph on the same vertex set, G\u2032 = (V, E \u2032), we have\nE \u2286 E \u2032 \u21d2 \u03c6(G,X ) \u2264 \u03c6(G\u2032,X ) (20)\nsince adding edges to a graph corresponds to changing the corresponding entries of its Laplacian matrix from 0 to 1, which can only increase the bandwidth. To\nprove the main result, consider the graph G\u2032 whose edge set is as follows:\nxj \u2208 Rx(xi, xi + r)\u21d2 (i, j) \u2208 E \u2032 (21)\n\u2200i \u2208 V, where Rx(a1, a2) is as defined in the statement of the theorem, and can be thought of as an infinitely long strip in Euclidean space.

Using the definitions of matrix bandwidth and graph Laplacian, we have\n\u03c6(G\u2032,X ) = max (i,j)\u2208E\u2032 (|i\u2212 j|) (23)\n= max i\u2208V\n( max ({ j \u2212 i \u2223\u2223 j \u2265 i, (i, j) \u2208 E \u2032 }))\n(24)\n= max i\u2208V\n( |X \u2229 Rx(xi, xi + r)| \u2212 1 ) (25)\nwhere the last equality follows from the construction of G\u2032. Using (20), we arrive at the desired inequality (19). \u25a0\nClearly, \u03c6max(X , r) bounds the minimal bandwidth \u03c6min(G) of a geometric graph as well. The following corollary shows that this bound can be further improved by minimizing (19) over the set of realizations that induce the same edge set E . Corollary 1.1 (Upper bound of \u03c6min(G)). For a geometric graph G = (V, E),\n\u03c6min(G) \u2264 min (X \u2032,r\u2032)\u2208RG \u03c6max(X \u2032, r\u2032) (26)\nwhere RG is the set of tuples defined as\nRG := { (X \u2032, r\u2032) \u2223\u2223 (G,X \u2032, r\u2032) is a geometric graph }\n(27)\nProof. Observe that \u03c6min(G) is completely determined by the edge set E of the graph. Thus, the inequalities\n\u03c6min(G) \u2264 \u03c6(G,X \u2032) \u2264 \u03c6max(X \u2032, r\u2032) (28)\nhold for all (X \u2032, r\u2032) \u2208 RG , giving us (26). \u25a0\nCorollary 1.1 is presented here only as a tangential result, because the minimization in (26) may be intractable, whereas the bound given in Theorem 1 is achievable in O(|V|| log |V|) time. Equation (28) summarizes the relationship between the various quantities introduced in this section. It remains to be established whether the bound achieved by the vertex relabeling algorithm (Alg. 3)\ngiven in Theorem 1 is indeed small. A tight bound on the minimal bandwidth of graphs is\n\u03c6min(G) \u2264 |V| \u2212 max i,j\u2208V (d(i, j)) (29)\nwhere d(\u00b7, \u00b7) is the length of the shortest path between a given pair of vertices in a graph [4, Th. 3.2.1]. This bound is not always useful for geometric graphs; in fact, one can observe that the bound (19) is more informative than (29) on the cycle graph in Fig. 1. Moreover, computing the second term of (29) itself requires up to O(|V|3) operations [5, Section 25.2], whereas Algorithm 3 can be viewed as an efficient algorithm for bounding the bandwidth of a geometric graph. Finally, it is shown in the next section that the vertex relabeling algorithm proves to be highly effective at reducing the graph bandwidth in typical WSN scenarios."

A commonly used model for large-scale WSNs which encapsulates these ideas is that of random geometric graphs [8, 15,24], which are characterized as follows.\nAlgorithm 4 Generative mechanism for random geometric graphs\nRequire: The domain D \u2286 Rd, the rate parameter \u03bb, and the sensing radius r \u2208 (0,\u221e)\n1: Generate a set of points X (\u03bb) = {x(\u03bb)1 , x (\u03bb) 2 , . . . }\nin the domain D using the homogeneous Poisson point process with rate parameter \u03bb. 2: Construct the vertex set V(\u03bb), with a vertex assigned to each of the points. 3: Construct the edge set E(\u03bb) as per the constraint on geometric graphs (3), with the sensing radius r. 4: return G(\u03bb) := (V(\u03bb), E(\u03bb)) and X (\u03bb)\nDefinition (Random Geometric Graph [9]). Any realization (G(\u03bb),X (\u03bb)) generated using Algorithm 4 is called a random geometric graph.\nThe choice of the Poisson point process as the underlying mechanism for generating the locations of\nWSN agents is well-motivated in the literature as well [11, 12]. The rate parameter \u03bb of the process dictates the spatial density of agents. Lemma 2 lists some of the important properties of random geometric graphs which follow from its definition.\nLemma 2 (Properties of random geometric graphs [6]). A random geometric graph (G(\u03bb),X (\u03bb)) in D \u2286 Rd has the following properties:\n1. For any region A \u2286 D, the distribution of the points X (\u03bb) \u2229 A conditioned on the number of points |X (\u03bb)\u2229A| is the multivariate uniform random distribution over the support A.\n2. For any region A \u2286 D,\n|X (\u03bb) \u2229A| \u223c Po (\u03bb \u00b7Vol(A)) (30)\nwhere Vol(\u00b7) is the d-dimensional volume.\n3. The expected number of vertices in G(\u03bb) is\nE [ |V(\u03bb)| ] = E [ |X (\u03bb) \u2229D| ] = \u03bb \u00b7Vol(D) (31)\nConsider a random geometric graph in D = [0, l]d. Using (30), and the fact that |X \u2229 Dc| = 0, we can see that\n|X (\u03bb) \u2229 Rx(a1, a2)| \u223c Po(\u03bbl(a2 \u2212 a1)) (32)\nwhere Rx(a1, a2) is defined as in Theorem 1. Equivalently, |X (\u03bb) \u2229 Rx(0, a)| is a 1-dimensional Poisson point process indexed by a \u2208 [0, l], having the rate parameter \u03bbl. To see this, one can apply the property (30) to this 1-dimensional process to yield (32). Using Theorem 1, we have\n\u03c6(G(\u03bb),X (\u03bb)) \u2264 \u03c6max(X (\u03bb), r) = max\n0\u2264a\u2264l\u2212r\n( |X (\u03bb) \u2229 Rx(a, a+ r)| )\n(33)\nThe last term in (33) is a random variable, called the scan statistic of the 1-dimensional Poisson point process (32). As tractable expressions (e.g., elementary functions of \u03bb and l) of moments, conditional moments or tail probabilities of the scan statistic are unknown [10], it is difficult to characterize an upper bound for the scan statistic. It is easier to study the term inside the max(\u00b7) operation instead. Using the property (30) of the 1-dimensional process (32), one can observe that\nE [ |X (\u03bb) \u2229 Rx(a, a+ r)| ] = \u03bblr (34)\nwhereas from (31), we have E [ |V(\u03bb)| ] = \u03bbl2, so that\nE [ |X (\u03bb) \u2229 Rx(a, a+ r)| ] = r \u221a \u03bbE [ |V(\u03bb)| ] (35)\nThis indicates that the upper bound on \u03c6(G(\u03bb),X (\u03bb)) is sublinear in the number of agents, unlike the general upper bound (29) which is linear. Indeed, the preceding argument is confirmed through simulations in Section 5, specifically in Fig. 7. The sublinear growth of the bandwidth achieved by the vertex relabeling algorithm, combined with its ease of implementation, motivates its use in large-scale WSN localization."

For each generated matrix, its inverse was approximated by a matrix of bandwidth L using Algorithm 1, with L ranging from 0 to 50. Figure 2 shows the approximation error as a function of L, the bandwidth of the approximated matrix. For L \u226b 1, the complexity of L-banded matrix inversion approaches that of general matrix inversion and the approximation error goes to 0. For smaller values of L, the approximation error decreases steeply until it is greater than the bandwidth of the matrix being inverted, illustrating that covariance matrices having a small bandwidth can be inverted efficiently with reasonable accuracy."

            "text": "Next, we demonstrate the proposed WSN localization approach using the example of distance-based localization. Figure 3 depicts the initial configuration of 30 agents in a 40m\u00d7 40m domain. Of these, 8 agents are beacons, i.e., they are able to measure their own position using GPS sensors with noise variance of 2m2. All agents are able to measure their distance from their neighboring agents, with a variance of 10m2. Thus, the agents follow the measurement model (5), with \u03d5(xi(k), xj(k)) := \u2225xi(k) \u2212 xj(k)\u2225. The sensing radius was chosen as 15m, yielding the\ngeometric graph shown in Fig. 3. The vertex relabeling algorithm was used to reduce the bandwidth of the graph to 8. The WSN was simulated for 100 timesteps using the LB-EKF algorithm with vertex relabeling (denoted as LB-EKF+VR), with an initial estimation error variance of 5m2 and process noise variance of 0.02m2. Note that the dimension of the collective position vector of the WSN is 60. We implemented LB-EKF+VR with L = 20 as well as the original EKF algorithm (which is equivalent to LBEKF with L = 59), with the latter serving as a basis for comparison. From (11), we see that EKF requires the inversion of 59 \u00d7 59 matrices, whereas from Algorithms 1 and 2 we know that LB-EKF only inverts 20\u00d7 20 matrices. For clarity of presentation, the labeling of the vertices is kept consistent between the plots.\nFig. 4 depicts the covariance ellipses of both algorithms at timestep 100, i.e., level sets of the form\n( x\u2212 x\u0302i(k) )\u22a4 M\u0306 (i)\u22121\nk\n( x\u2212 x\u0302i(k) ) \u2264 20\nwhere M\u0306 (i) k is the i th diagonal block element of M\u0306k, and the number 20 is chosen for visual emphasis. Note that the ellipses are centred around the estimated position vector of either algorithm at each agent. The covariance ellipses allow us to visualize how well the banded error covariance M\u0306k of the LBEKF+VR algorithm approximates the true error covariance Mk of the EKF algorithm. It can be seen that the ellipses are nearly coincident, as the parameter L of LB-EKF+VR is large enough to capture the cross-covariances between agents. The estimates of LB-EKF+VR are slightly overconfident (have smaller ellipses) when compared to EKF, as LB-EKF effectively ignores the cross-covariances between agents that are far away from each other in terms of the labeling.\nThe above experiment is repeated for 5000 Monte Carlo trials. To demonstrate the importance of vertex relabeling, we implemented EKF, LB-EKF with vertex relabeling (LB-EKF+VR) as well as LB-EKF without vertex relabeling, i.e., using an arbitrary labeling of the vertices. Figure 5 shows the mean squared error (MSE) of the individual agents, defined as\nMSEi(k) = \u2225xi(k)\u2212 x\u0302i(k)\u22252\nFigure 6 shows the total MSE of the network,\u2211 i\u2208V MSEi(k). While the three algorithms achieve comparable performance at the beacon agents (i.e.,\nagents 1 and 30 in Fig. 5), the LB-EKF algorithm without vertex relabeling has worse performance at other agents. The MSE of LB-EKF+VR is close to that of EKF, in both the transient and steady-state segments of the simulation. This demonstrates that the vertex relabeling approach allows us to greatly reduce the computational burden of large-scale WSN localization while retaining reasonable estimation accuracy and convergence properties."

To this end, we generate independent samples from the 1-dimensional uniform random distribution in the domain [0, l], for varying values of l. From Property 1 of Lemma 2, we know that the points generated in this manner correspond to the points generated by a 1-dimensional Poisson point process in\n[0, l], conditioned on the total number of points. Furthermore, from (32), we know that this is equivalent to generating points in a 3-dimensional (cubic) domain, since the vertex relabeling algorithm sorts the points based on their x-coordinate alone1. Together, the foregoing observations allow us to compute the value of \u03c6max(X (\u03bb), r) for a large number of points in a [0, l]2 domain efficiently.\nThe sensing radius r was chosen as 15m. The simulations were repeated for the rate parameters \u03bb = 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05 and 0.1. To put these numbers into perspective, the expected number of agents in a 40m \u00d7 40m domain is 8, 16, 32, 80 and 160, respectively, for the corresponding choices of \u03bb. Thus, the chosen values of \u03bb capture both sparse and densely connected networks.\nFigure 7 shows the value of \u03c6max(X (\u03bb), r) plotted against the total number of agents in the graph. It can be noted that the bandwidth indeed grows very slowly compared to the maximal bandwidth of the graph, which grows linearly. The growth of the bandwidth slightly overshoots the predicted growth of (35), since the analysis leading to (35) ignored the max(\u00b7) operation involved in the computation of \u03c6max(X (\u03bb), r). The standard deviation of the achieved bound is quite small as well; this is because as the number of agents increases, the max(\u00b7) operation takes the maximum over a large number of agents, so that the law of large numbers comes into effect. Consequently, the vertex relabeling algorithm achieves a small bandwidth on typical WSN configurations with high probability."
