It is, thus, desirable to experimentally explore systems that can be continuously tuned across these transitions. Here, we demonstrate such tunability and the electronic correlation effects in triangular moire\u0301 superlattices formed between trilayer MoTe2 and monolayer WSe2 (3L-MoTe2=WSe2). Through transport measurements, we observe an electronic analog of the Pomeranchuk effect at half filling of the first moire\u0301 subband, where increasing temperature paradoxically enhances charge localization. At low temperatures the system exhibits the characteristic of a Fermi liquid with strongly renormalized effective mass, suggesting a correlated metal state. The state is highly susceptible to out-of-plane electric and magnetic fields, which induce a Lifshitz transition and a metal-insulator transition (MIT), respectively. It enables identification of a tricritical point in the quantum phase diagram at the base temperature. We explain the Lifshitz transition in terms of interlayer charge transfer under the vertical electric field, which leads to the emergence of a new Fermi surface and immediate suppression of the Pomeranchuk effect. The existence of quantum criticality in the magnetic-field-induced MIT is supported by scaling behaviors of the resistance. Our work shows the 3L-MoTe2=WSe2 lies in the vicinity to the MIT point of the triangular lattice Hubbard model, rendering it a unique system to manifest the rich correlation effects at an intermediate interaction strength.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevX.12.041015 Subject Areas: Condensed Matter Physics Strongly Correlated Materials\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe discovery of correlated phenomena in twisted bilayer graphene opens a new avenue for studying electron correlations in two-dimensional (2D) moire\u0301 superlattices, which host novel band structure reconstruction and exotic quantum phases [1\u20134]. Lately, semiconductor moire\u0301 systems based on transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) heterostructures have been shown to offer alternative\nplatforms with appealing opportunities [5\u201315]. Moire\u0301 excitons, trions, and polaritons [16\u201322], Mott insulators [23\u201325], generalized Wigner crystals at fractional fillings [26\u201328] (including those that spontaneously break rotational symmetry [29,30]), and topological phases [31] have been experimentally observed. It is generally accepted that the low-energy Hamiltonian of the TMDC moire\u0301 system can be effectively described by the triangular lattice Hubbard model [5], which is one of the central paradigms in describing correlated systems with geometrical frustration [32\u201337]. When doped with one charge per site (halffilled band), the large spin entropy owing to the frustration and competing orders can give rise to the Pomeranchuk effect or an exotic nonmagnetic insulating state [e.g., quantum spin liquids (QSLs)], depending on the interaction strength U=W, where U is the on-site Coulomb repulsion *yang.xu@iphy.ac.cn Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

Despite extensive research efforts on the triangular lattice Hubbard model, many aspects of its rich phase diagram remain unexplored due to the high complexity of the problem and the lack of suitable experimental platforms in different coupling regimes. In TMDC moire\u0301 homo- or heterobilayers (such as twisted WSe2 or MoTe2=WSe2) with small band offsets between neighboring layers, the charge density and vertical electric fields can be independently controlled by electrostatic gates, enabling in situ tuning across quantum phase transitions (QPTs) [38,39]. However, the precise nature of the QPT so far is not well understood [38,40\u201343]. The canonical problem of the Hubbard model under an external magnetic field, which can polarize the spins and control the exchange interactions, is also unsettled and worth further investigation [44\u201347]. Utilizing the sensitivity of the interaction strength to the dielectric environment and interlayer coupling, we fabricate a new type of moire\u0301 heterostructure consisting of trilayer MoTe2 and monolayer WSe2. The multilayer TMDC (3L-MoTe2 here)-based superlattices can also potentially offer new opportunities to explore moire\u0301 physics (e.g., that arises from the \u0393 valley instead of the K valley) exhibiting different symmetries and strengths of spin-orbit coupling [8,48\u201350]. Detailed information of the band structure analyses for bare 3L-MoTe2 and the 3L-MoTe2=WSe2 heterostructure is presented in Supplemental Material [51]. In this paper, we discover a rich and exotic quantum\nphase diagram tuned by both out-of-plane electrical and magnetic fields in the 3L-MoTe2=WSe2. At half filling of the first moire\u0301 subband, we find a resistance peak that counterintuitively develops with increasing temperature. This behavior resembles the Pomeranchuk effect observed in He-3 and is attributed to the close vicinity of our system to the MIT point in the triangular lattice Hubbard model. Because of the small valence band offset of the two materials, the hole-type charge carriers are first injected into the MoTe2 and the subband population fromWSe2 can be continuously tuned by the vertical electric field, which drives a Lifshitz transition and alters the charge transport greatly. The process is accompanied by a breakdown of the single-band Hubbard model description of the system. The magnetic field, which suppresses spin fluctuations, can induce a MIT following the quantum critical scaling. We observe continuous closure of the charge gap when approaching the quantum critical point from the insulating side and divergence of effective quasiparticle mass from the metallic side."

All the other data are acquired in a He-3 cryostat (base T \u00bc 300 mK, B up to 9 T). Measurements are performed using a standard low-frequency (9.373 Hz) lock-in technique under a small bias voltage (1\u20132 mV). Voltage drops Vxx and Vxy and source-drain current (I) are recorded simultaneously to obtain the corresponding longitudinal and Hall resistances. Both the voltage drops are measured using voltage preamplifiers with large input impedance (100 M\u03a9) to maintain the measurement accuracy.

            "text": "Figure 1(b) shows the longitudinal 2D sheet resistance \u03c1xx as a function of V tg and Vbg measured at an intermediate temperature T \u00bc 20 K. The two arrows denote the directions for increasing D or n, respectively. Notably, the sample exhibits a resistance peak along a constant density line [with n \u2248 5 \u00d7 1012 cm\u22122; see Supplemental Fig. S1(d) [51] ], corresponding to one hole per moire\u0301 unit cell or half filling of the first moire\u0301 subband, namely, moire\u0301 filling factor \u03bd \u00bc 1. We do not observe any sharp feature corresponding to the \u03bd \u00bc 2 band insulating state. Instead, the resistance exhibits a broadened hump at Vbg < \u223c2 V due to charge population of the \u0393 valley in the 3L-MoTe2 (see more discussions in Supplemental Material [51]). Upon increasing the D field, the \u03bd \u00bc 1 peak disappears abruptly (near D \u223c 1.5 V nm\u22121). The behavior is reminiscent of a recently reported bandwidth-tuned Mott transition in MoTe2=WSe2 heterobilayers [38]. However, we find that the resistance peak here is gradually suppressed with decreasing temperature and completely vanishes at the lowest T \u00bc 0.3 K [see the resistance color mappings and constant V tg line cuts at selective temperatures in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d), respectively], in sharp contrast to the Mott insulating state [23,24,26]. In other words, the resistance peak at half filling gets enhanced only at elevated temperatures, indicating a heat-induced charge localization at the\n041015-2\nspecific commensurate doping density (\u03bd \u00bc 1). Similar effects in moire\u0301 superlattices were first reported in magicangle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) [52,53] and referred to as the Pomeranchuk effect, which is an electronic analog of thehigher-temperature solidificationofHe-3 [32,37,54\u201356]. This unusual behavior is due to the larger spin entropy in the localized state (solid phase in He-3 or singly occupied state in 3L-MoTe2=WSe2). The system is then favorable to increase the degree of localization upon heating. The neighboring local moments in 3L-MoTe2=WSe2 have antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions [5,23,37,38], whereas in TBG isospin polarization is favored for the j\u03bdj \u00bc 1 states [52,53]. Phenomenologically, we note that a similar Pomeranchuk effect is observed in theMoTe2=WSe2 heterobilayers at a very narrow electric field range near the critical electric field (Ec \u223c 0.65 V nm\u22121) that drives the MIT [38]. However, we point out that the underlying mechanisms could be very different for the two systems (explained later). A representative \u03c1xx versus T curve for the \u03bd \u00bc 1 state (at D \u00bc 1.313 V nm\u22121) is shown in Fig. 1(e). The sample exhibits an insulating behavior (d\u03c1xx=dT < 0) at\ntemperatures higher than T \u223c 40 K, below which a crossover to a metallic behavior (d\u03c1xx=dT > 0) is observed with \u03c1xx decreasing by more than one order of magnitude (from about 40 to 0.3 K). At T < \u223c10 K, the \u03c1xx\u00f0T\u00de can be well described by a Fermi liquid behavior \u03c1xx\u00f0T\u00de \u00bc AT2 \u00fe \u03c10 (highlighted by the dashed blue curve), where A1=2 is proportional to the quasiparticle effective mass m (Kadowaki-Woods scaling) [57,58] and \u03c10 is the residual resistance. The value of A is extracted to be \u00f064.1 0.9\u00de \u03a9=K2 or \u00f04.53 0.06\u00de \u03bc\u03a9 cm=K2, considering a thickness of approximately 0.7 nm for a single layer of MoTe2. This value is comparable to those of many heavy fermion systems, indicating substantial quasiparticle-quasiparticle scatterings and a strongly renormalized effective mass at low temperatures [59]. A maximum of \u03c1xx \u223c 25 k\u03a9 is reached at T \u223c 40 K, indicating kFl (with kF being the Fermi wave vector and l being the mean free path) of the system to be about unity, as inferred from the Ioffe-Regel criteria. T is known as the coherence temperature characterizing the related energy scales (such as the renormalized bandwidth W ) in strongly correlated materials [60,61].\n041015-3\nThe hence enhanced charge localization is concomitant with an increase of entropy (per quasiparticle) toward ln2 (at approximately T , arising from the spin degree of freedom), whereas the Fermi-liquid state has a lower entropy proportional to T=T [55,56]. The contribution from the spin fluctuations to the entropy is shown later. At T > \u223cT , the quasiparticle mean free path l becomes comparable to or smaller than the moire\u0301 wavelength of approximately 5 nm, and the transport enters an incoherent regime, giving rise to the insulating behavior. In the inset in Fig. 1(e), we plot the inplane magnetic field (Bk) dependences of \u03c1xx at two different temperatures (T \u00bc 1.6 and 30 K). Unlike the TBG at j\u03bdj \u00bc 1 [52,53], 3L-MoTe2=WSe2 is insensitive to the in-plane magnetic field. Now we discuss the effect of the vertical displacement field (D) at \u03bd \u00bc 1. At different temperatures, a similar value of the D field is observed where the resistance maxima disappear [Fig. 1(c)]. In Fig. 2(a), we plot the temperature dependence (0.3\u201370 K) of \u03c1xx at different D fields. The \u03c1xx gradually changes from a nonmonotonic behavior to a\nmonotonic and metallic behavior with a weaker T dependence at largerD fields. At low temperatures (T < \u223c10 K), all resistance curves follow T2 dependences with \u03c1xx\u00f0T\u00de \u00bc AT2 \u00fe \u03c10 [Fig. 2(b)]. The extractedA coefficient is plotted in the inset in Fig. 2(b) as a function of theD field. The A value stays nearly a constant at small D fields, while it decreases drastically by more than 30 folds starting from an inflection point at approximately 1.49 Vnm\u22121, which is denoted as the transition field Dt [dashed vertical line in the inset in Fig. 2(b)]. It indicates strong suppression of electronic interactions in the system and an approximately 80% reduction of effective quasiparticle mass. The high-temperature value of \u03c1xx near Dt is close to 12.9 k\u03a9. On both sides of the transition, the sample exhibits metallic ground states with Fermi liquid behaviors. This \u201cmetal-metal\u201d transition observed here contrasts the electric-field-inducedMIT found in MoTe2=WSe2 [38]. The Dt value (corresponding to Et \u00bc Dt=\u03b5r \u00bc 0.50 V nm\u22121,where \u03b5r is theout-of-planedielectric constant of h-BN) is also smaller than the critical electric field (with Ec \u00bc 0.65 V nm\u22121) for MIT in the heterobilayer [38].\n041015-4\nThe magnetotransport studies (under out-of-plane magnetic fields B\u22a5) suggest that the D field in our sample introduces a Lifshitz transition atDt, beyond which charges are redistributed between different subbands or layers. As shown in Fig. 2(c), the \u03c1xx (at \u03bd \u00bc 1) is plotted as a function of both D and B\u22a5 at the base temperature T \u00bc 0.3 K. At small values of D, the sample encounters a transition to an insulating state (with \u03c1xx > 107 \u03a9; see more data in Fig. 3) above about 6 T. Combined with the barely changed inplane magnetoresistance [inset in Fig. 1(e)], the strong magnetic anisotropy suggests an Ising type of spin-orbit coupling of the charge carriers that likely arise from K=K0 valleys of the MoTe2. It is also consistent with the fact that the finite out-of-plane displacement field lifts the layer degeneracy and leads to a strong localization of K=K0 valley wave functions on the topmost layer of the trilayer MoTe2 (more discussions can be found in Supplemental Material [51]) [62]. At larger values of D, clear Shubnikov\u2013de Haas (SdH)\noscillations due to the formation of Landau levels are\nobserved at B\u22a5 > \u223c3 T. The generated Landau fan (also indicated by the dashed lines in the lower diagram) converges to D \u00bc 1.492 V nm\u22121 in the zero B\u22a5 field limit. The value coincides (while being more accurate) with the transition field Dt discussed above and indicates the emergence of a well-defined Fermi surface at D > Dt. Hence, it corresponds to a Lifshitz transition. The linear dependences of the Landau levels on the D field indicate that the size of the new Fermi surface is directly proportional to (D \u2212Dt). A cyclotron effective mass (0.52 0.01\u00deme (with me being the free electron mass) can be determined from analyzing the temperature dependence of the SdH oscillations (see more details in Supplemental Fig. S3 [51]). It is close to the effective mass found in monolayer WSe2 K=K0 valleys [63,64]. We, thus, conclude that the charge transfer induced by the vertical electric field happens between the K=K0 valleys of the MoTe2 top layer and the adjacent WSe2 monolayer [schematics shown in Fig. 2(d)], giving rise to two sets of quantum oscillations observed atD > Dt (see Supplemental\n041015-5\nFig. S4 [51]). Further evidence for assigning the valley occupations can be found in Supplemental Material [51]. Such observations place a question of explaining the electricfield-induced MIT as the bandwidth-controlled Mott transition within the framework of the single-band Hubbard model [38]. Since the charge transfer between MoTe2 and WSe2 can happen at rather low electric fields, another likely scenario is that the charge population in the WSe2 layer naturally destroys the Mott insulating state in the heterobilayers. The Pomeranchuk effect observed near the critical electric field in the 1L-MoTe2=WSe2, hence, may have a very different origin comparing to our observations in a relatively large electric field range (1.1 Vnm\u22121 < D < Dt) where the single-band Hubbard model description is valid. In the following, we demonstrate the quantum criticality induced by the out-of-plane magnetic field B\u22a5 at \u03bd \u00bc 1 and D < Dt. We plot the dual-gate mappings of \u03c1xx at different B\u22a5 [Fig. 3(a)]. A resistance peak at \u03bd \u00bc 1 can be identified at approximately 5 T for D < Dt and quickly becomes prominent at higher fields [see line cuts in Fig. 3(b)]. At fixed D fields [see an example in Fig. 3(c)], the \u03c1xx weakly depends on B\u22a5 at low magnetic fields, accompanied by a linear Hall resistance \u03c1xy due to the Lorentz force. The lowfield Hall slope gives a density of 5.4 \u00d7 1012 cm\u22122, close to the expected moire\u0301 density. Both \u03c1xx and \u03c1xy diverge at approximately 6 T, which is then identified as the critical magnetic field Bc. The B\u22a5-induced MIT at \u03bd \u00bc 1 is clearly illustrated in Fig. 3(d), where we show the temperature dependences of sheet resistance \u03c1xx (0.3\u201370 K) at a few representative magnetic fields. Above Bc, the sample exhibits characteristics of an insulator following a thermal activation behavior \u03c1xx \u221d E\u00f0\u0394=2kBT\u00de [inset in Fig. 3(d)], where kB is the Boltzmann constant and \u0394 is the activation gap. At low temperatures and below the critical field (Bc), the resistance drops upon cooling, exhibiting the characteristics of Fermi liquids. The extracted prefactor A is plotted as a function of jB\u22a5 \u2212 Bcj in the upper inset in Fig. 3(e), showing a power-law dependence A1=2 \u221d \u00f0Bc \u2212 B\u22a5\u00de\u22120.98 0.11. Our result suggests a divergence of the effective mass (\u221d A1=2) at the MIT [65,66]. After normalizing \u03c1xx\u00f0T\u00de by the \u03c1c\u00f0T\u00de at 6 T (critical field Bc) and scaling the temperature by a field-dependent T0, the resistance curves readily collapse onto two branches in the Fig. 3(e) log-log plot. We notice the \u03c1c has a complicated dependence on the temperature. Possible reasons are discussed in Supplemental Material [51]. On the insulating side (B\u22a5 > Bc), T0 is calculated from the fitting parameter \u0394=kB, while on the metallic side (B\u22a5 < Bc), the same T0 is used as the insulating side with equal distance to the critical field at jB\u22a5 \u2212 Bcj <\u00bc 3 T. Because we do not have data at higher magnetic fields, the T0\u2019s of B\u22a5 \u00bc 0\u20132 T are picked independently to scale the curves nearly symmetric to the insulating branches about \u03c1xx=\u03c1c \u00bc 1. The scaling parameter kBT0 continuously vanishes as it approaches the critical field [lower inset in\nFig. 3(e)]. The B\u22a5 dependences of kBT0 follow a powerlaw behavior kBT0 \u221d jB\u22a5 \u2212 Bcj0.73 0.02 near both sides of the critical field (highlighted by the dashed red and blue curves, respectively). The critical exponent 0.73 0.02 is close to the value found in the bandwidth-tuned MIT reported by Li et al. [38], indicating the QPTs tuned by the two different parameters share the same universality class. The half-filled Hubbard model under an external magnetic field has been extensively studied theoretically [44\u201347,67]. It has been puzzling for a long timewhether the magnetic-field-driven MIT should be continuous or firstorder-like. Recent studies suggest the nature of the transition depends on the correlation strength. Our observation in 3L-MoTe2=WSe2 near the critical field (with strongly enhanced effective masses when approaching the transition from the metallic side) is, in general, consistent with the theoretical prediction of the magnetic-field-induced spinpolarized band insulator at the intermediate correlation strength (U \u223cW) [44,46,47]. However, we do not observe any hysteresis upon sweeping up and down the magnetic field [Fig. 3(c)], signifying the character of a continuous phase transition. We can then estimate the Zeeman energy g\u03bcBB\u22a5 \u223cW \u223c kBT to be 3.5 meV and the Lande\u0301 g factor to be g \u00bc \u223c10. The role of orbital effects from the out-ofplane magnetic fields that could reduce the bandwidth is not considered here."

            "text": "Figure 4 summarizes our main observations at half filling of the 3L-MoTe2=WSe2 sample. In Fig. 4(a), the resistance (in logarithmic scale) is plotted in the three-dimensional space projected on the T \u2212D (B\u22a5 \u00bc 0), T \u2212 B\u22a5 (D \u00bc 1.313 V nm\u22121), and D \u2212 B\u22a5 (T \u00bc 0.3 K) planes. The temperature and magnetic field axes are drawn as kBT and g\u03bcBB\u22a5 to represent the thermal and Zeeman energies, respectively. First, the vertical electric field can induce charge transfer between different subbands and cause a breakdown of the single-band description of the system. It drives the system from a strongly interacting metal to a weakly interacting metal (evidenced by the great reduction of the A value) accompanied by the Lifshitz transition. Second, the perpendicular magnetic field induces the metal-to-insulator QPT at Bc (highlighted by the dashed yellow curve in the D \u2212 B\u22a5 plane). The asterisk symbols illustrate the T (separating the high-temperature insulating behavior from the low-temperature Fermi liquids) as a function of D and B\u22a5. A quantum tricritical point (highlighted by the pink circle) can be identified at Dt \u00bc 1.49 V nm\u22121 and Bc \u00bc \u223c6 T where phase transitions tuned by the two nearly independent parameters meet at the base temperature (see more discussions in Supplemental Fig. S4 [51]). In Fig. 4(b), we illustrate the generally accepted phase\ndiagram of the half-filled triangular lattice Hubbard model with tuning the interaction strength U=W. The ground state\n041015-6\nof our sample at D < Dt and B\u22a5 \u00bc 0 is a correlated metal exhibiting a Fermi-liquid behavior at low temperatures (with strongly renormalized effective mass) and Pomeranchuk effects. The observations are consistent with an intermediate coupling strength in the vicinity to the left side of the MIT [32,37,55,56] [marked by the yellow star in Fig. 4(b)]. Spin fluctuations and geometric frustrations give rise to larger entropy in the exotic nonmagnetic insulating state (e.g., chiral QSLs [36,37]) compared with the metal phase. Pomeranchuk effect arises with the enhanced charge localization at higher temperatures, since it yields a gain in free energy. It can also be seen from the Maxwell relation\n\u2202S \u2202U T \u00bc \u2212\u2202F \u2202T U ;\nwhere double occupancy (F denoting the fraction of the charges in doubly occupied lattice sites) decreases (namely, single occupancy increases) as a function of the temperature, since the entropy S is positively correlated with U near the MIT [37,55,68]. The perpendicular magnetic-fielddriven MIT likely originates from the Zeeman-fieldinduced spin splitting, realizing a spin-polarized band insulator at high fields (when the Zeeman energy excesses the renormalized bandwidth W ) [44\u201347].\nThe vicinity to the intermediate coupling region in 3L-MoTe2=WSe2 provides a novel example of the richness and complex phase diagrams that can be unveiled in moire\u0301 superlattices. The observed Pomeranchuk effect is closely related to the higher entropy in the singly occupied state at half filling. Our observations could have implications on the existence of the elusive QSL phase at larger correlation strength, whereas compelling evidence is still missing. The multiband nature of the system also suggests it as a promising platform to construct and simulate the physics of a two-band Hubbard model [11] or a moire\u0301 Kondo lattice [69,70] with unprecedented controllability."
