    "abstractText": "The single-point diamond-turning operation is a commonly used method for ultra-precision machining of various non-ferrous materials. In this paper, a magnetic field was introduced into a single-point diamond-turning system, and magnetic-field-assisted turning experiments were carried out. The results revealed that the magnetic field affects the metal-cutting process in the form of the cutting force, chip morphology, and surface quality. Compared with traditional turning, magneticfield assisted turning increases the cutting force by 1.6 times, because of the additional induced Lorentz force, and reduces the cutting-force ratio and friction coefficient on the rake surface by 16%, with the improved tribological property of the tool/chip contact-interface. The chip morphology in the magnetic-field-assisted turning shows the smaller chip-compression ratio and the continuous side-morphology. With the magnetoplasticity effect of the metal material and the friction reduction, magnetic-field-assisted turning is helpful for improving metal machinability and achieving better",

            "text": "Single-point diamond turning (SPDT) has been extensively applied in many precision and ultra-precision machining fields, for example, optical lens, optical reflector, disk base, etc. It can achieve excellent dimension-accuracy and good surface-roughness on the nanoscale, by using natural-diamond cutting tools [1,2]. The high-precision parts made of nonferrous materials, such as various single-crystal and polycrystalline metals, are very suitable for production with SPDT [3,4]. SPDT has been a research hotspot in the mechanical-machining field for a long time. As a single-crystal metal, single-crystal copper is commonly used to produce optical reflectors and various substrate materials, owing to its good electrical and thermal conductivity and chemical catalytic-performance, as well [5]. Lee et al. [6] investigated the surface-quality anisotropy on machined surfaces in the diamond cutting of single-crystal copper, and the best machining-direction was suggested. The effect of machining parameters in the nanocutting of a single-crystal-copper workpiece was studied by Zhang et al. [7], who found the depth of cut showed a significant influence on the defect layer. Because of its softness feature, single-crystal copper is easy to cut, but relatively difficult to grind, due to the blockage of the grinding wheel. Hence, SPDT becomes one of the ideal and commonly used methods for ultra-precision machining. Recently, the energy-field-assisted machining methods have attracted significant attention, in areas such as laser-assisted cutting, ultrasonic-vibration-assisted cutting and magnetic-field-assisted cutting [8\u201310]. The primary objective of energy-field-assisted cutting is to obtain the \u201c1 + 1 > 2\u201d effect, to further improve the machining quality. The magnetic-field-assisted cutting is a novel energy-field-assisted machining method. In 1976, Muju et al. [11,12] and Kumagai et al. [13] found that the external magnetic-field helped\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 2147. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi13122147 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 2147 2 of 13\nto decrease the cutting-tool wear. Therefore, this application of the magnetic field to the metal-cutting field has been developed into two branches. First, the magnetic field was used to magnetize the cutting tool to improve its material microstructure and cutting performance [14,15]. Then, Mansori et al. [16,17] introduced an additional magnetic-field action into the metal-cutting process, and found magnetic-field action can change metalcutting mechanics and obtain tribological interface-modifications on tool\u2013chip contact. The results revealed that magnetic-field action in the metal-cutting process is effective for reducing tool wear. Mkaddem et al. [18] found that with an increase of magnetic intensity in magnetic-field-assisted cutting, the shear angle increased, and the contact length and friction coefficient of tool\u2013chip contact decreased. Alireza et al. [19] performed magnetic-field-assisted cutting experiments, and found that it achieved an approximately 94% decrease in flank wear and a 66% reduction in cutting force. Yip et al. systematically investigated the advantages of magnetic-field-assisted cutting, including tool-life enhancement, tool-tip-vibration reduction, material swelling and recovery reduction [20\u201323]. From this literature, it is concluded that the magnetic field is a promising energy-field-assisted machining method with various advantages, but the essential cutting mechanisms are inadequately understood at present. To verify this novel energy-field-assisted machining method and investigate the influence of magnetic-field action during the metal-cutting process, magnetic-field-assisted turning experiments were conducted on single-crystal copper with (111) crystal plane. The actual magnetic-distribution in the cutting zone after introducing an external magnetic-field was analyzed. Then, the cutting force and cutting-force ratio in magnetic-field-assisted turning and the obtained chip and surface quality were compared with conventional turning-processes, to analyze the relevant cutting mechanisms."

Single-crystal diamond is the perfect material for the cutting tool, due to its outstanding properties such as ultra-high hardness, low friction-coefficient and a cutting edge of high sharpness. The used single-crystaldiamond tool was prepared by Shanghai Suporhard Tools Co., Ltd. The single-crystaldiamond tool exhibits the rake- and flank-angle parameters of 0\u25e6 and 5\u25e6, respectively, and its tool nose-radius was 1 mm, as shown in Figure 1. Roughness of tool surface greatly affects the friction properties between the tool and workpiece surface during the cutting process. Roughness of rake and flank surface were assessed as approximately 1.46 nm and 104.28 nm, respectively using the atomic force microscope (Alpha 300RA, WITec, UIm, Germany). As shown in Figure 1c, the edge radius of this used single-crystal-diamond tool was measured to approximately 115 nm.

A magnetic-isolation cover fixture made of 45 steel was used to avoid the interference of the magnetic field on the linear motor. It can shield more than 96% magnetic intensity by testing with a tesla meter. Only one direction is opened to introduce the magnetic field into the workpiece and cutting zone. The remanence and coercive force were 1.18 T and 880 KA/m, respectively. The average magnetic-flux density is 0.38T, and the distance between the two permanent magnets is 190 mm.\nFigure 2.

The depth of cut (4\u201312 \u00b5m) is much smaller than the tool-nose radius (1000 \u00b5m). Only the partial tool-nose assists in the metal-cutting process. This is the reason why the effective tool-cutting edge angle is very low, and is calculated to be less than 0.7\u25e6. Hence, the main components of the resultant force are distributed in a tangential direction, Fz, and a normal direction, Fy. The component of the resultant force in a radial direction, Fx, is very small, and close to zero, and it is difficult to acquire an accurate value.

By comparison, the obtained cutting-force exhibits a similar variation trend, both in magnetic-field-assisted and traditional turning, under different machining parameters. Figure 6a exhibits the cutting-force curve varying with the tested-feed rate. While the feed rate rises from 2.4 to 8.8 \u03bcm/r, the tangential and normal cutting-force in conventional turning go up from 0.18 N and 0.09 N to 0.46 N and 0.21 N, respectively, and they increase from 0.27 N and 0.11 N to 0.67 N and 0.26 N respectively, in magnetic-field-assisted turning. It is found that, although both tangential and normal force increase along with the rising feed-rate, the discrepancy between tangential and normal cutting-force increases as well, at the same time. When fr = 2.4 \u03bcm/r, the discrepancies are 0.09 N and 0.16 N without and with the magnetic field, respectively, and increase to 0.25 N and 0.41 N, respectively, when fr = 8.8 \u03bcm/r. This indicates that the tangential cutting-force exhibits a higher increment than the normal force. Since the depth of cut rises from 4 to 12 \u03bcm, the cutting force exhibits an almost linear increase, as shown in Figure 6b. The same results are observed for the discrepancy between the tangential and normal cutting-force, which increases along with the rising depth of the cut. A possible reason is that the effective tool-cutting edge angle becomes larger, along with both the rising depth of cut and the feed rate. This reduces the component force in an axial direction, and then results in the larger discrepancy between tangential and normal cutting-force. As shown in Figure 6c, both tangential and normal cutting-force gradually decrease, along with the rising cutting-speed.\nFigure 5. tti -f r -si l i p = 10 \u00b5 , fr = 5.6 \u00b5 /r, v = 6.4 m/s), (a) cutting-forcesignal without magnetic field, (b) cutting-force-signal ith agnetic field.\nThe cu ting-forc t c i ing para eters are shown in Figure 6.

A possible reason is that the effective tool-cutting edge angle becomes larger, along with both the rising depth of cut and the feed rate. This reduces the component force in an axial direction, and then results in the larger discrepancy between tangential and normal cutting-force. As shown in Figure 6c, both tangential and normal cutting-force gradually decrease, along with the rising cutting-speed. From the cutting-force comparison between magnetic-field-assisted turning and conventional turning, it is clear that the cutting force in magnetic-field-assisted turning is relatively larger than that of traditional turning. According to the statistical data of the cutting-force results, tangential and normal cutting-force in magnetic-field-assisted turning are an average of 1.9 and 1.6 times, respectively, that of traditional turning. Single-crystal copper is a good conductor, while the copper workpiece rotates in the magnetic-field zone during the turning process; this can be equivalent to the case in which a conductor in a closed circuit cuts the magnetic-induction line in the introduced magnetic-field zone [24,25], as shown in Figure 7. According to the electromagnetic induction principle, the eddy current will be induced inside the copper workpiece, and the eddy current obeys the following equation:\nE = BLv (1)\nwhere E represents the eddy current, and B represents the magnetic-flux density, L represents the conductor length and v represents the cutting velocity. The induced eddy-current will produce an additional Lorentz force, Fm, on the workpiece [18], which obeys the following equation:\nFm = BEL (2)\nwhere Fm represents the Lorentz force and E represents the induced eddy-current. The direction of this Lorentz force is exactly opposite to the movement direction of the equivalent conductor to prevent its relative motion, and the value of this Lorentz force is proportional\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 2147 6 of 13\nto the length of the equivalent conductor. As shown in Figure 8, the Lorentz force, Fmz, that is induced by the cutting movement, is added to the tangential force, and the Lorentz force, Fmy, which is induced by the chip-flow movement, is added to the normal force during the cutting process. Due to the relatively larger area of the workpiece material, compared with that of the produced chips during the cutting process, the induced Lorentz force, Fmz, in a tangential direction is relatively larger than the Lorentz force, Fmy, in the normal direction. This reason explains exactly the larger cutting-force in magnetic-field-assisted turning.

The cutting-force ratio slightly decreases along with both the rising depth of the cut and the feed rate, but its overall variation range is very small.

This reason is helpful to reduce tool wear, and also explain the reduced cutting-force ratio and friction coefficient in this study. According to the relationship between the friction angle and shear angle from Formula (2), this result also indicates that the shear angle in the cutting process becomes larger, which is helpful for achieving better surface quality.\n3.3. Chip Morphology The generated chips were collected after the turning experiments. Figure 10 shows\nthe chip morphology comparison from the same magnification view under different machining parameters. Due to the small machining parameters in SPDT, the chip morphology shows thin, flat shape-features. From high magnification images, the side morphology of the chips is curled with features, due to the severe material extrusion and the plastic side-flow in the metal-cutting process [27].

Because of the plastic deformation of the formed chips, the chip thickness usually increases and becomes larger than the uncut-chip thickness; however, chip length and width usually decrease and become smaller than the actual cutting distance and cutting width. The chip-compression ratio is calculated by cutting width divided by chip width. From the results, it is revealed that the chip-compression ratio in magnetic-field-assisted turning is smaller than that of the traditional turning. It is known that the friction coefficient on the rake face in magnetic-field-assisted turning is smaller, and this factor helps to obtain the smaller chip-compression ratio. The curling and tearing features of the chip-side morphology obviously reduce in magnetic-field-assisted turning. This results also reveal the lower amount of chip deformation in magneticfield-assisted turning. According to the literature [28,29], the magnetic-field action can increase the workpiece-material plasticity, based on the magnetoplasticity mechanism, because the magnetic field can promote a dislocation motion in the tensile quality of the material. The better material-plasticity usually leads to the smaller chip-compression ratio in the metal-cutting process, as well. These factors in magnetic-field-assisted turning are helpful for alleviating the severe extrusion and the material plastic side-flow in the metal cutting process, and the trend is to improve metal machinability.\n3.4. Surface Quality In the experiments, each surface-roughness result that was measured along the radial direction was repeated five times, in different positions. Figure 11 shows the surfaceroughness results under different machining parameters. SPDT can achieve good surfacefinish: the obtained surface-roughness in this work varies, in the range of 10-20 nm.

Conclusions This work presents an experimental investigation on magnetic-field-assisted turning of single-crystal copper material with a single-point diamond cutting-tool. According to the experiment results, the following conclusions were drawn: 1. Magnetic-field action with magnetic-flux density of 0.38T is introduced into a single-\npoint diamond-turning system by neodymium iron magnets, to carry out magneticfield-assisted turning. The cutting force in the magnetic-field-assisted turning increases up to 1.6 times more than the conventional turning because of the additional Lorentz force, which is induced by the equivalent conductor which cuts the magnetic-induction line during the metal-cutting process. Compared with conventional turning, magnetic-field-assisted turning can decrease the cutting-force ratio and friction coefficient on the rake face by approximately 16%, because of the modified tribological property on the tool/chip contact.\n2. The chip-compression ratio in magnetic-field-assisted turning is smaller than the conventional turning. Magnetic-field-assisted turning tends to obtain continuous-chipside morphology with a lower level of chip deformation, due to the magnetoplasticity mechanism. Magnetic-field-assisted turning is helpful for improving metal machinability with friction reduction and the magnetoplasticity effect, the average surface-roughness reduces, from 16.2 nm to 15 nm.\nAuthor Contributions: X.W. and F.J., responsible for the overall research ideas; K.S., Y.Z. and C.F., responsible for turning experiments; X.W., L.Z., Y.L.
