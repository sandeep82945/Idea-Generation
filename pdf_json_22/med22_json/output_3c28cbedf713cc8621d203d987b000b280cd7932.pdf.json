    "abstractText": "Objective: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) refers to unusual permanent dilation of the abdominal aorta, and gradual AAA expansion can lead to fatal rupture. However, we lack clear understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease. The effect of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) on vascular functional status has attracted increasing attention. Here, we try to identify the potential mechanisms linking AAA and PVAT.",

However, we lack clear understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease. The effect of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) on vascular functional status has attracted increasing attention. Here, we try to identify the potential mechanisms linking AAA and PVAT.\nMethods: We downloaded dataset GSE119717, including 30 dilated AAA PVAT samples and 30 non-dilated aorta PVAT samples from AAA cases, from Gene Expression Omnibus to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We performed pathway enrichment analysis by Metascape, ClueGo and DAVID to annotate PVAT functional status according to the DEGs. A protein-protein interaction network, the support vector machine (SVM)-recursive feature elimination and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression model were constructed to identify feature genes. Immune infiltration analysis was explored by CIBERSORT. And the correlation between feature gene and immune cellswas also calculated. Finally,weused the angiotensin II (Ang II)-ApoE\u2212/\u2212mouse model of AAA to verify the effect of feature gene expression by confirming protein expression using immunohistochemistry and western blot.\nResults: We identified 22 DEGs, including 21 upregulated genes and 1 downregulated gene. The DEGs were mainly enriched in neutrophil chemotaxis and IL-17 signaling pathway. FOS was identified as a good diagnostic feature gene (AUC = 0.964). Immune infiltration analysis showed a higher level of T cells follicular helper, activatedNK cells, Monocytes, activated Mast cells in AAA group. And FOS was correlated with immune cells. Immunohistochemistry and western blot confirmed higher FOS expression in PVAT of the AAA mouse model compared to control group.\nConclusion: The differentially expressed genes and pathways identified in this study provide further understanding of how PVAT affects AAA development.

            "text": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is caused by pathological dilation of the abdominal aorta, which can lead to rupture from diameter expansion and subsequent death. AAA is one of leading causes of mortality in the elderly (Nordon et al., 2011; Neumann et al., 2019). There are no efficient drugs or potential therapeutic targets for early-stage AAA and no interventions to reverse disease progression, limiting patient care to image surveillance (computed tomography angiography or ultrasound). When the diameter of an AAA expands significantly or causes other complications such as pain, open surgery or endovascular repair are considered to revascularize the aorta (Karthikesalingam et al., 2016). Although there are some biomarkers related to vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, inflammation, and other immune responses in AAA, they fail to confirm AAA progression sensitively and specifically (Wanhainen et al., 2016). Therefore, finding effective targets to prevent AAA progression should be prioritized.\nPerivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) plays a complex role in vascular function. From a protective perspective, PVAT can produce factors such as NO and H2S to attenuate vasocontraction and protect endothelial function (Emilova et al., 2015; Virdis et al., 2015; Xia et al., 2016). On the other hand, PVAT also can promote macrophage infiltration and inflammatory response around the aorta wall. Further, adipose tissue transplantation in the carotid artery can significantly increase atherosclerotic plaque formation (Konaniah et al., 2017). PVAT-derived free fatty acid can activate nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), reactive oxygen species, and protein kinase C, which may lead to a series of inflammatory downstream activation (Liu et al., 2017; Qi et al., 2018; Rogero and Calder, 2018).\nAccumulating evidence demonstrates that PVAT plays an essential role in AAA formation (Kugo et al., 2017). Stimulated by inflammation, PVAT may act as an endocrine tissue, releasing adipokines and maintaining aortic homeostasis (Qi et al., 2018; Piacentini et al., 2020). Macrophages in PVAT could invade the aortamedia to augment AAAdevelopment, which has been shown in the Ang \u2161-induced mouse background (Police et al., 2009). A metaanalysis including 10 animal experiments and 8 human studies showed that AAA is correlated with a high concentration of plasma adipokines. Although several studies have examined the relationship between adipokines and AAA, this relationship remains poorly understood (Thanigaimani and Golledge, 2021). We need conduct more basic experiments to explore the role of PVAT in AAA formation and progression.\nGene expression microarray is a valuable method to explore potential biomarkers and related functions in many diseases (Jie\net al., 2020). We used the GSE119717 dataset from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between dilated PVAT samples and non-dilated PVAT samples in AAA cases. Further, we identified DEGs that may play a role in AAA and their potential molecular mechanisms, and we verified our discoveries in an animal model of AAA."

Mice were randomly assigned to a control group or experimental group. Osmotic mini-pumps (model 2004, Alzet) containing either angiotensin \u2161 (Ang \u2161, 1000 ng/kg/min, Sigma; A9525) or saline were respectively embedded in the experimental group (n = 6) to generate AAA or the control group (n = 6) for 4 weeks. The authors in sequencing paper studied the aneurysmal sac and proximal neck of the same AAA patient in order to avoid confounding effects of other factors, and they excluded Marfan syndrome, recent major surgery (6 months), and auto-inflammatory or immune vascular disease when selecting their patient samples (Piacentini et al., 2019). Similar to their grouping, for the Ang \u2161-treated experimental mice, we divided each one into a dilated group (aneurysmal sac, n = 6) and a non-dilated group (proximal neck of AAA, n = 6). Our processing of all mice was based on the principle of random assignment. All operations were performed under aseptic conditions. At 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 days, we measured mouse weight, blood pressure (Tail-cuff system, BP-2000, Visitech Systems, Apex, NC, United States), and aortic diameter (Visual Sonics, Toronto, Canada). After a 28-days standard diet and water, the PVAT of three animals in each group was harvested. Three of each group were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 \u00b0C for further western-blot test. And the other 3 in each group were collected and stored in 10% formalin for further histology and immunohistochemistry staining. All procedures complied with the Animal Experimental Ethics Committee of our hospital (Beijing, China) (zryhyy21-21\u201307\u201302) and the United States National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publication No. 85\u201323).\nFrontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org02\nMicroarray dataset and data repeatability test\nWe downloaded the GSE119717 dataset, based on the GPL10558 platform of HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip, from GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). This dataset included 30 AAA PVAT samples and 30 nondilated aorta PVAT samples, obtained from the proximal neck of the aorta from AAA patients. We carried out principal component analysis (PCA) to visualize gene expression and help evaluate sample repeatability and variability. All the data was normalized by \u201climma\u201d package.\nIdentification of differentially expressed genes\nWe used the Bioconductor package \u201climma\u201d in R software to identify significant DEGs between PVAT of AAA samples and control aorta samples in the data. We used t-test to calculate p-value, with a set cutoff point of adjusted p < 0.05, and threshold points of |log fold change| > 1. Additionally, volcano plots and heatmaps were generated in R software to assess DEGs.\nFunctional enrichment of differentially expressed genes\nGene ontology (GO)\u2014which consists of three essential aspects: biological process, molecular function, and cellular component\u2014and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were conducted to assess the biological mechanisms associated with DEGs. KEGG is an integrated database used to understand advanced biological functions and protein interaction networks at the molecular level. We used DAVID (Sherman et al., 2022), Metascape (Zhou et al., 2019) and ClueGO (Bindea et al., 2009) to perform pathway enrichment. These three tools have different algorithms which could play a role of mutual verification. p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.\nConstruction and Analysis of Protein-Protein Interaction\nNetwork and Identification of Hub Genes.\nTo identify the potential protein-protein interaction (PPI) network according to the identified DEGs, we used the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database. STRING is an online tool that provides direct and indirect correlations of PPI (Szklarczyk et al., 2015). We used the Cytoscape software cytoHubba plug-in to clarify hub genes, visualize the PPI network, and select the top 5 hub genes with the greatest degree rank."

Notably, IL-17 signaling pathway was the most important pathway in Metascape, ClueGo and DAVID. And neutrophil chemotaxis was enriched by Metascape and ClueGo.\nFeature genes and biomarkers screening\nWe used Cytoscape software to show the PPI network, which was constructed according to the STRING database. Using the cytoHubba method to identify genes with the greatest degree rank, the top 5 hub genes were: FOS, JUN, ATF3, DUSP1, EGR1 (Figure 3A). All the DEGs were used to conduct LASSO regression and SVM-RFE machine learning. The LASSO logistic regression analysis was used to obtain 4 genes: CSF3R, CXCL8, FOS, SLN (Figures 3B,C). And the minimum absolute contraction criterion was 0.003678. The SVM-RFE identified 5 genes: FOS, FOSB, EGR1, DUSP, JUN (Figure 3D). By combining the genes obtained from these three methods, FOS was thought as the most important feature gene in PVAT of AAA (Figure 3E). And we tested the diagnostic efficacy of FOS, a high level of area under the curve (0.964) showed that FOS had a good diagnostic value (Figure 3F).\nImmune infiltration and correlation between immune cells and FOS\nIL-17 played an important role in regulating immune response (Ruiz de Morales et al., 2020). So, we conduct immune cells infiltration analysis by CIBERSORT. The vioplot indicated that PVAT in expanded aorta area had higher level of follicular helper T cells, activated NK cells, Monocytes, activated Mast cells (Figure 4A). As showed in Figure 4B, the correlation of immune cells indicated that activated CD4 memory T cells were positively correlated with B cells memory (r = 0.63). Regulatory T cells were positively correlated with memory B cells (r = 0.62) and CD4 na\u00efve T cells (r = 0.63), but negatively correlated with M2 macrophages (r = -0.5). Activated Mast cells were positively correlated with follicular helper T cells (r = 0.54), resting Dendritic cells (r = 0.67), Eosinophils (r = 0.67). And follicular helper T cells were positively correlated with resting Dendritic cells (r = 0.78) and Eosinophils (r = 0.78). The percentage of each immune cell was showed in Figure 4C. We further investigated the relationship between FOS and immune cells (Figure 4D). FOS was positively correlated with follicular helper T cells (r = 0.53, p\uff1c0.001), activated Mast cells (r = 0.52, p < 0.001) and na\u00efve B cells (r = 0.27, p = 0.037), but negatively correlated with resting Mast cells (r = -0.29, p = 0.023).\nConstruction of abdominal aortic aneurysm animal model and FOS expression\nWe used Ang \u2161 (1000 ng/kg/min) to build an AAA model in the ApoE-/- mouse. The main difference between dilated and non-dilated abdominal aorta within the same individual is that the elasticity and compliance of normal vessel wall are lost in the dilated group, causing the wall to become distorted and dilated (Derwich et al., 2020). In our research, we measured mouse weight, blood pressure, and aortic diameter to track AAA progression every 7 days. Although no mice died during our 4-week feeding period, the aneurysm in the AAA group had shown considerable enlargement in diameter and complete rupture of the elastic fiber layer encasing the organ cavity as we showed in Figure 5B and Supplementary Figure S1, forming a pseudoaneurysm in a very high-risk state. Compared with the saline controls, Ang \u2161-induced mice presented significantly higher blood pressure, lower body weight, and dilated abdominal aortas (Figure 5A). In addition, H-E staining suggested obvious distortion and expansion of the vascular cavity, Masson\u2019s trichrome staining showed collagen hyperplasia, and van Gieson staining revealed broken elastic fibers in the AAA model (Figure 5B and Supplementary Figure S1). We also verified the diagnostic value of FOS in our AAA model, immunohistochemistry (Figure 6A and Supplementary Figure S2) and western blot (Figure 6B) showed increased expression of FOS in the AAA model compared to control mice and non-dilated area. These results showed that FOS is a reliable diagnostic biomarker to discriminate AAA from normal samples."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "The function of PVAT in AAA formation has drawn more attention recently. Inflammatory cells produced by a dysfunctional PVAT infiltrate the abdominal aortic vessel wall and promote inflammation (Omar et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2020). PVAT promotes the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, which disrupts collagen and elastic fibers in the abdominal aortic wall, making the wall more prone to dilation and fracture (Kurobe et al., 2013; Horimatsu et al., 2017). Additionally, stem cells and immune cells, particularly T cells, produced from PVAT have a substantial correlation with AAA size (Ye et al., 2021). However, the specific mechanism of PVAT-derived genes and factors with AAA remains unclear, so we performed a bioinformatics analysis of the GSE119717 dataset expecting in the hopes of uncovering new points for the unique action.\nOur bioinformatics analysis found 22 DEGs, 21 upregulated and 1 downregulated, in PVAT from AAA. IL-17 signaling pathway and neutrophil chemotaxis were two major pathways we enriched in this analysis. It is generally recognized that AAA is\nFrontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org07\ncaused by inflammation that destroys the arterial wall and causes abnormal expansion of the aorta (Shimizu et al., 2006). IL-17 has already been found elevated in human inflammatory or immune diseases (Albanesi et al., 1999; Ma et al., 1999). Produced by adaptive and innate immune cells including CD4+ Th17 cells, CD8+ Tc17 cells, IL-17 predominantly acts to regulate and amplify signals during interaction with other cytokines such as TNF (Majumder and McGeachy, 2021). TNF-\u03b1 is considered to promote inflammation, and TNF-\u03b1 expression is upregulated in adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells of AAA patients (Huang et al., 2019). Inhibiting TNF-\u03b1 expression can reduce matrix destruction and inflammatory infiltration as well as attenuate AAA pathogenesis, and TNF-\u03b1 plays an important role in matrix remodeling (Xiong et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2019). Moreover, it has been reported that smooth muscle cell derived IL-17C could recruit TH17 cells to\nperivascular and promotes atherosclerosis (Galkina et al., 2006). IL-17 can also stimulate neutrophil chemotaxis by inducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (Strz\u0119pa and Szczepanik, 2011).\nIt was found that activated T cells are highly aggregated in the PVAT around the AAA and that they can produce inflammatory substances to migrate to the abdominal aortic vessel wall, which is closely related to the size of the AAA (Xiong et al., 2004; Sagan et al., 2019). T cells in PVAT can produce IL17, which in turn promotes the expression of downstream inflammatory factors and MMP (Nosalski and Guzik, 2017; Berry et al., 2022). Similarly, IL17 has been found to be pathogenic in AAA. IL17 are significantly increased in AAA patients and animal models and promote smooth muscle cell remodeling (Sharma et al., 2012). However, there are no experiments to conclusively validate PVAT-IL17-AAA as a pathogenic mechanism in the\nFIGURE 4 The immune cells infiltration between dilated and non-dilated groups.

(D) The correlation between FOS and immune cells.\nFrontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org08\nformation of AAA. Given the strong relationship among the three, we believe that this is a promising pathway for further study.\nMany immune cells participate the formation of AAA (Spear et al., 2015). Those immune cells are also observed in PVAT and increase the probability of AAA formation (Police et al., 2009). Due to the close relationship between IL-17 and immune cells, we further investigated immune cell\nin PVAT by CIBERSORT. Our immune cells infiltration showed that there was significantly difference between PVAT from AAA and control group. T cells in PVAT could express CD25, CD44 and CD69 markers and express humorous receptors for inflammatory cytokines (Antony et al., 2010). The cytokines produced by immune cells in PVAT could regulate the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (McMaster et al., 2015). IL-\nFrontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org09\n17A could induce the deposition of collagen and change the compliance of aorta. Knockout of IL-17A could reduce superoxide production and fibrosis. And TNF-\u03b1 and IL17A act synergistically to increase human aortic smooth muscle cell expression of CCL8, CSF3, CXCL2, and CCL7 (Madhur et al., 2010). And the cytokines produced by immune cells can also affect on perivascular adipocytes. It has been proved that leptin has pro-inflammatory effects and adiponectin has anti-inflammatory effects. IL-17A and TNF-\u03b1 could inhibit the production of adiponectin whereas promote the production of leptin (Nosalski and Guzik, 2017).\nFOS was identified as the most valuable diagnostic biomarker by combining LASSO regression, SVM-RFE machine learning and hub genes. In this study, FOS was upregulated in PVAT of AAA and positively correlated with follicular helper T cells, activated Mast cells and na\u00efve B cells whereas negatively correlated with resting Mast cells, which indicates that FOS may participate the activation of immune and inflammatory response and play a pro-inflammatory role. FOS and JUN constitute activator protein-1 (AP-1), which can be induced by TNF-\u03b1 in inflammation. Activation of AP-1 can result in the membrane attack complex inducing higher expression of MMP2 and MMP9, which are the main proteinases in AAA (Wu et al., 2010). Additionally, increased levels of FOS have been shown in aortic aneurysm (Wu et al., 2010). After 4 weeks, the Ang \u2161 induced AAA model showed significantly aorta expansion and elastic fibers rupture.\nWe conducted immunohistochemistry staining and westernblot to explore the expression of FOS in PVAT. Our results support the bioinformatic result that expression of FOS increased in the PVAT of the AAA model. Yet this elevation remains controversial. Previous work has shown that miR-1555p which could inhibit the viability of vascular smooth muscle cells was upregulated in human AAA samples and the expression of FOS was significantly less than normal. Increasing FOS expression could weaken the effect of miR155-5p mimic on vascular smooth muscle cells viability (Zhao et al., 2019). It seems that FOS acts as a double-edged sword in regulating vascular smooth muscle cells. More experiments are needed to validated the role of FOS.\nThere are several limitations to our research. First, we use the Ang \u2161-induced AAA mouse model for verification instead of human samples and we did not compare standard mice with ApoE mice. Second, the feature gene we verified may be altered during sample harvesting and preservation. Third, the immune infiltration is inferred by bioinformatic method which may have inevitable limitations and further experiments should be carried out to validate this view. Additionally, there is a substantial relationship between aortic PVAT density and aneurysm diameter in the same individual (Dias-Neto et al., 2018). Our investigation, however, was unable to adequately analyze the density of PVAT among various mice and the link between PVAT quantity and AAA development. Further improvement could be achieved by expanding the sample size and performing\nFIGURE 6 FOS expression in PVAT of control and AAAmice. (A) Immunohistochemistry staining of FOS expression.
