1. **Investigate the potential of Sanguisorba minor as a natural food preservative.** The study mentioned that S. minor has strong antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, which could be useful in preserving food and preventing spoilage. Future research could focus on testing the efficacy of S. minor extracts or compounds in inhibiting the growth of foodborne pathogens and extending the shelf life of food products.


2. **Explore the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of Sanguisorba minor.** The study mentioned that S. minor has been used in traditional medicine to treat inflammatory conditions, but there is limited scientific evidence to support these claims. Future research could investigate the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of S. minor extracts or compounds in vitro and in vivo models, to determine their potential for treating inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease.


3. **Evaluate the neuroprotective effects of Sanguisorba minor in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases.** The study mentioned that S. minor has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which could be beneficial in protecting against neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Future research could investigate the neuroprotective effects of S. minor extracts or compounds in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, to determine their potential for preventing or slowing the progression of these diseases.


4. **Investigate the potential of Sanguisorba minor as a natural pesticide or insecticide.** The study mentioned that S. minor has been used as a traditional insect repellent, but there is limited scientific evidence to support this claim. Future research could investigate the insecticidal properties of S. minor extracts or compounds against common pests, to determine their potential for use as natural pesticides or insecticides in agriculture or pest control.


5. **Study the effects of Sanguisorba minor on gut microbiota and its potential implications for human health.** The study mentioned that S. minor has been used in traditional medicine to treat gastrointestinal disorders, but there is limited scientific evidence to support these claims. Future research could investigate the effects of S. minor extracts or compounds on gut microbiota composition and function in vitro and in vivo models, to determine their potential for improving gut health and treating gastrointestinal disorders.
