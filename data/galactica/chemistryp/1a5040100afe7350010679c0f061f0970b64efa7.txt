conclusions Complex brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex are likely to contain heterogeneous cell types which have the potential to mask phosphorylation effects of the drug relevant to the therapeutic mechanism. A phosphoproteomics analysis of smaller regions with cellular homogeneity may reveal more robust effects of deferiprone on molecular targets. As deferiprone has been previously shown to have antidepressant-like properties and the current phosphoproteomics analysis has identified molecular mechanisms involved in the action of existing antidepressant, this study is an important benchmark for further experimentation. It would also be informative to examine other brain regions implicated in the antidepressant-like properties of deferiprone and MDD such as the amygdala, as they may reveal additional molecular factors involved in deferiprone’s therapeutic mechanism of action. The data indicates that acute deferiprone treatment on the prefrontal cortex alters phosphorylation of proteins involved in synaptic, glutamatergic and dopaminergic signalling in the 5-HTT KO mouse model of depression. Additionally, there was an effect on proteins involved in cytoskeletal organisation irrespective of genotype. It is likely too simplistic to suggest that one protein or neurotransmitter is involved in the positive effects of a therapeutic in a complex disorder like MDD. Instead, it is probable that a combinatory effect of glutamate and dopamine neurotransmitter signalling on synaptic plasticity and cytoskeletal protein mechanisms are involved in deferiprone’s antidepressant-like properties.
