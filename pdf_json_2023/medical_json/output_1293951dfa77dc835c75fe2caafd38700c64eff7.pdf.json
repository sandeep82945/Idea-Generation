    "abstractText": "Background and Objectives: Most thermal energyinduced distal ureter injuries are missed intraoperatively as they are caused by delayed ischemia-induced necrosis of the affected part leading to fistula, and a delayed presentation. The injuries of the distal ureter are commonly managed by ureteroneocystostomy, which has long-term complications related to vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR). We present our experience of management of distal ureter injury due to thermal energy by laparoscopy ureteroureterostomy and the role of various methodologies for its diagnosis. Methods: It is a retrospective, single-center study that was conducted from January 1, 2020 \u2013 December, 31 2022. Results: A total of 8 cases were enrolled in the study. All cases had an uterovaginal fistula (UVF) post-laparoscopic gynecology surgery. The bilateral ureteric injury was observed in 2 cases. The median post-surgery time to diagnose UVF in the study was 10 days. All cases were managed by laparoscopy ureteroureterostomy (LUUS). Six cases underwent immediate surgery after the diagnosis; whereas 2 cases had initial double-J stent placement as treatment, which subsequently failed following which the LUUS was performed. There were not any immediate or long-term complications such as leakage, stenosis, fistula, or any requirement for revision surgery. Conclusion: Themanagement of thermal energy-induced ureteric injury is exceptional as compared to other types of ureteric injury. Our approach should be toward immediate surgical management rather than a conservative one to avoid long-term complications and sequelae. Iatrogenic lower ureteral injury can be managed successfully by LUUS, maintaining the normal anatomy and physiology of VUR.",

            "text": "Ureteral injuries are an ordeal for the surgeon as it is difficult to diagnose intraoperatively in pelvic laparoscopic procedures which require a high index of suspicion, surgical expertise, and a detailed knowledge of ureteric anatomy in the pelvis. Varied grave complications like urinoma, ureteral stricture, ureteral obstruction, and probable loss of renal function can arise from an unrecognized or delayed presentation of ureteral injury. The literature cites that most intraoperative ureteral injuries occur during gynecologic surgery (52\u201382%), in which hysterectomy accounts for most cases. Hysterectomies for any benign pathologies had 0.33\u20131.7%1,2 associated risk of genitourinary injury. The rest of the ureteric injuries have been documented during urologic (25%), colorectal (15%), and vascular surgical procedures (5%).3\nThe ureteric injury, during any laparoscopic gynecologic surgery, usually occurs following over-cauterization while achieving hemostasis, or due to lateral thermal energy spread. Presently, ureteric injuries during operative laparoscopic gynecologic procedures are on the rise owing to its wide availability.4 Among various inflictions on the ureter, the thermal injury-induced insult is supposedly different from other injuries like crushing, ligation, transection, avulsion, resection, or angulation. While all the other injuries to the ureters will be limited to the site of the injury, the thermal-induced injury will be more widespread than\nDepartment of Gynaecological Endoscopy, Eva Women\u2019s Hospital, Ahmedabad, India.

The proposed mechanism for any post-laparoscopic ureteric fistula is devascularization following which ischemic ends undergo necrosis and fibrosis, and further, retract and lead to fistula formation.5,6 This is the reason for the delayed presentation of ureteric fistula, approximately 7\u201321 days post-surgery, following any thermal injury. The suggested maneuvers for immediate intraoperative detection in any ureteric injuries post thermal injury as the presence of bilateral ureteric jet on intraoperative cystoscopy, intraperitoneal visualization of ureteric peristalsis after surgery, and peroperative injection of phenazopyridine or sodium fluorescein dye to see for any leakage were not useful.\nThere has been a notable shift in the treatment approach for ureteric injury from laparotomy to minimally invasive treatment by laparoscopy or robotics. As early as 1991, Gomel and James7 and Nezhat et al. in 19928 published a case report on the laparoscopy repair of ureteric injury. Since then various kinds of complex urological surgeries have been performed laparoscopically, including bladder reimplantation as well. A considerable incidence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) with laparoscopic ureteroneocystostomy (LUN) with subsequent progression on long-term to recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), pyelonephritis, renal scarring, and renal failure is disapproving.9 Laparoscopy ureteroureterostomy (LUUS) has been a promising surgical alternative with commendable outcomes,10 but it is a strenuous surgical exercise to get an adequate length of the distal end along with diligent intracorporeal suturing to prevent ureteric stricture and the risk of recurrent fistula. The decision of repair depends on the site of ureteric injury and its timing of identification. The general proposition is to do immediate surgical repair, if there is an early presentation (within 72hours), at least with a less invasive procedure with a double-J (D-J) stent insertion with a therapeutic intent into the affected ureter for 6weeks. If there is a delayed presentation, any surgical intervention is warranted for 6weeks to 3months for the tissue edema, inflammation, and fibrosis to subside.11 In contrast, there are studies in the literature advocating similar surgical outcomes following an immediate or delayed surgical management for a ureteric injury.12 We present our experience in the management of thermal energy-induced iatrogenic ureteral injury at the distal pelvic ureter and its laparoscopic repair by end-to-end ureterureter anastomosis. The role and importance of various preventive and diagnostic methods as prophylactic D-J stent placement before surgery for ureteric identification or the role of immediate endourological treatment by stenting has also been discussed in detail."

A CT-IVP provides a better 3D delineation of the relevant anatomy and continuity of the whole urinary tract as well as the site of ureteral injury through the extravasation of contrast material at the location. Delayed scans using CT-IVP reveal an enhancement of fluid collection due to contrast leaking from a ureteric injury, outlining a track connecting the vagina to the distal ureter. Several other findings on CT imaging studies that are suggestive of a ureteral injury include the absence of contrast material distal to the injury due to the transection or complete obstruction, ipsilateral hydroureter, hydronephrosis, and incomplete visualization of the entire ureter.14 There are chances of false positive results when the lesion is too close to the vesico-ureteric junction owing to a dye leak in the bladder. Low ureteric injury cases are usually associated with vesicovaginal fistula in 12\u201325%.15 A pre-operative clear diagnosis regarding the different sites of involvement along with any fistulous connection is imperative for definitive management. Thus, a detailed\nJuly\u2013September 2023 Volume 27 Issue 3 e2023.00030 2 JSLS www.SLS.org\nintraoperative exploration and dissection of the ureter and the bladder will further substantiate the pre-operative diagnosis. Patients with renal failure or with contraindications for CT may utilize a pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of the same.\nAn antegrade pyelogram is an imaging modality for the upper urinary tract. It may be used as a preliminary investigation for the detection of UVF in a limited resource setting. The positive findings suggestive of a fistulous tract may be extravasation of dye outside the ureter, leakage of contrast media into the vagina, or features of hydronephrosis and hydroureter without vaginal drainage. Though this has a very low sensitivity for UVF detection (33%). In case of a dilemma, retrograde pyelography can be performed as a definite test. This technique additionally has the benefit to differentiate between a ureterovaginal fistula from a vesicovaginal fistula. Alternatively, an examination of the fluid leaking through the vagina for the urea and creatinine levels can diagnose urine, if the findings are too close to normal urine (urine creatinine: > 10mg/dL).16"

The various port position was as routine with a supra-umbilical primary 10-mm port for the camera along with 3 accessory 5-mm trocars inserted, two on the surgeon\u2019s left side and one on the right side. The head\u2019s low position was provided adequately to keep the bowel away from the pelvic cavity. Cystoscopy was routinely performed to visualize the bilateral ureteric orifice and for the evaluation of the bladder wall. Coexisting vesicovaginal fistula were also looked for as there were incidences of combined vesicovaginal fistula along with ureterovaginal fistula.\nInitially, the first endo view is visualized with a detailed inspection and analysis of the site of the injury, associated positive findings, and most importantly the tissue health for regenerative surgery. The first endo view of a case of right UVF is shown in Figure 1. The surgery is started with a retroperitoneal dissection, in which the overlying peritoneum is incised starting from the level of sacral promontory towards the round ligament followed by tracing the ureter in the medial fold of the peritoneum from its entry into the pelvic cavity. The ureter is then lateralized from its medial attachment with a meticulous dissection keeping its adventitia layer intact (Figure 2). The proximal end is adequately mobilized to get an adequate length for tension-free anastomosis. The surgery is usually performed using a cold scissor as a dissector and suction, as required, using the energy sources as minimally as possible. The distal end of the injured ureter can be identified by concomitant use of cystoscopy and laparoscopy by placing guide wire by cystoscopy and tracing its tract intra-peritoneally (Figure 3). Under laparoscopic guidance, a guidewire (0.635 mm in diameter) is introduced into the proximal cut end of the ureter through the rail-road technique (Figure 4). Further, over this guidewire, the surgeon inserts a size 5 French D-J stent (Figure 5a). Subsequently, dissection of the\nJuly\u2013September 2023 Volume 27 Issue 3 e2023.00030 3 JSLS www.SLS.org\nlower end has further proceeded to get an adequate length for suturing along with the excision of devitalized tissue (Figure 5b). The repair alternatives depend on the availability of the length of the cut end of the distal ureter. A deliberate dissection with an adequate mobilization of the proximal ureter for tension-free anastomosis is justified.\nThe successful ureteral repair depends on the following principles:10\n\u2022 All devitalized tissue should be essentially debrided to get healthy vascularized tissue at both the cut ends. \u2022 A tension-free anastomosis with sufficient ureteral mobilization is a must. \u2022 It is critical to preserve the ureteral adventitial sheath (as it has minute vessels interlinked by a web of anastomosing arcades that supply the ureter)16 and its vasculature for an adequate ureteral blood supply. \u2022 A ureteroureterostomy should be performed over a ureteral stent with a spatulated end frommucosa to mucosa. It should be a water-tight and tension-free anastomosis using an absorbable suture. The choice of repair depends on the availability of distal ureter end length.\nThe first stitch is placed at the 6 o\u2019clock position with a polyglactin 910 (Vicryl 3-0 or 4-0) approximating mucosa to mucosa and then further stitches are placed in the same way at the 3, 12, and 9 o\u2019clock positions, in a single layer (Figure 5c, d). Intraoperatively, postureteric anastomosis, the vascularity of the anastomotic site is assessed using clinical features such as visualization of surrounding capillary refill. Multiple stitches at an anastomotic site should be avoided as it increases the risk of fibrosis and further enhances the risk of stricture formation at the operative site. The intra-peritoneal drain in the pelvic cavity is kept in situ in all cases. The Foley catheter was placed in all patients at the end of the procedure.\nJuly\u2013September 2023 Volume 27 Issue 3 e2023.00030 4 JSLS www.SLS.org"

Bilaterality was observed in 2 cases, while 6 cases had a unilateral ureteric\ninjury. Interestingly, 1 patient had an injury at 3 sites over both ureters.\nThe most common presenting symptom was the leaking of clear fluid per vagina followed by flank pain. The median age in the study population was 40 years (range 38\u2013 52 years) and the median body mass index was 24 kg/m2 (range 22\u201332 kg/m2). The indications for hysterectomy in the study were adenomyosis (n5 3), fibroid uterus (n5 1), deep infiltrating endometriosis (n5 3), and carcinoma cervix (n5 1).

Conservative management was planned for this case with bilateral D-J stent insertions, which were kept in situ for 6weeks. The follow-up CT-IVP after the removal of the D-J stent still showed a bilateral ureteric fistula, with an even further increase in size. The fistula on the right side was now 2.5cm and 1.5cm on the left side. At this point, the decision to proceed with surgery was made, with LUN performed on the left side ureter and LUUS was performed on the right side.\nCase number 8 (Table 1), required prophylactic intraoperative bilateral D-J stent insertion due to extensive ureterolysis during the surgery, which was kept in situ for 3weeks. The follow-up CT-IVP after the removal of the D-J stent revealed a bilateral ureteric fistula at 3 sites, 2 cm on the right side and 1.5 at the low pelvis near the bladder, and 1 cm on the left side away from the bladder. The decision for reconstructive surgery was taken with 8weeks in situ D-J stent post-surgery (Figure 6).\nThe mean operative time was 90min (range 90\u2013130min) with an average blood loss of 30ml (30\u201350ml). The intraperitoneal drain was removed if the drain output was < 10ml per day with a mean duration of 2 days (2\u20133 days). The D-J stent was kept in situ for a median duration of 8weeks (6\u20138weeks). Three patients had post-D-J stent infection symptomatology, after which treatment was given according to the culture and sensitivity report. One patient had developed post-stent stricture after 6months of reconstruction surgery at the level of the infundibulopelvic ligament which required ureteroscopy balloon\ndilatation of the affected part and placement of respective D-J stent for 8weeks. None of the cases had any associated vesicovaginal fistula in the study population. No postoperative blood transfusion, any serious intraoperative complications, or conversion to laparotomy were required in any of the cases. The median hospital stay was 2 days (range 2\u20133 days). There were no immediate postoperative complications like infection, paralytic ileus, fever, significant pain, or recurrent fistula. Long-term follow-up also revealed no complaints of leakage, stenosis, obstruction, necrosis, hydronephrosis, fistula, or requirement of revision surgery. All patients had complete disease resolution as per clinical and radiological findings."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "Ureteric injury may frequently lead to catastrophic consequences owing to its delayed exposition.\nIn this article, we discuss various intraoperative and preventive maneuvers along with varied diagnostic methods as enumerated in the literature for early detection and management. Prophylactic ureteral stents or catheters can be placed before the surgery to assist in the intraoperative identification of ureters. This is often performed in pelvic surgeries that occur close to the ureter, to exemplify gynecologic cases like deep infiltrating endometriosis of parametria, vault endometriosis, and LRH. This is of great significance in cases where the pelvic operative field is already scarred from previous dissection done during the endometriosis surgery with the possibility of ureters being close to the uterus due to healing fibrosis. Nevertheless, the pre-operative ureteric stent placement to prevent its injury is a topic of debate.17 Ureteric stents can only help in the identification of ureters, but their benefits are limited in cases requiring ureteric tunnel dissection. The proper knowledge of different energy sources18 along with the identification of their lateral spread is of utmost importance, as the lateral spread of energy, if not identified and managed properly will still be the causative factor for ureteric injury, even after the intraoperative recognition of ureters. Further, ureteric stent placement makes ureteric handling more difficult during dissection, owing to loss of its pliability, and thus, has increased chances of ureteric trauma. The placement of lighted ureteral stents can also be one of the preventive measures but still, there is an associated risk of injury due to lateral spread of thermal energy.\nEven the role of prophylactic or therapeutic ureteric stent placement in a case of extensive ureteric dissection with\nJuly\u2013September 2023 Volume 27 Issue 3 e2023.00030 7 JSLS www.SLS.org\nno intraoperative diagnosed iatrogenic ureteric injury or with a peroperative diagnosed case of iatrogenic ureteric injury respectively, in minimally invasive approach is of questionable advantage in the prevention of ureteric injury, as observed in our study with case numbers 5 and 8 (Table 1 and Figure 6). The intraoperative features might suggest ureteric injury and thus can guide further management plans. If there is capillary refill even delayed, it indicates reversible injury. On the contrary, if it is a complete blanching without refill with loss of vascularity (Figure 7) and no capillary refill, this may indicate probable chances of future fistula and this injury should be immediately excised with suturing of healthy ends over a D-J stent for anastomosis. The probable mechanism explained for the injury could be ischemia induced necrosis that gradually increases with time and thus further increases the defect. Also, these cases may have longterm complications on follow-up as stricture or fistula. Ideal management would be to completely excise all devitalized tissue followed by repair of two healthy ends over a D-J stent. Accordingly, since the fibrotic end will not heal and therefore will not seal any minor defect itself as well, the role of a D-J stent cannot be therapeutic. Short-term or long-term use of any ureteral stents are usually associated with minor complications like hematuria, dysuria, frequency, flank, or suprapubic pain to major complications such as vesico-ureteric reflux, migration, encrustation, urinary tract infection, stent fracture, and necrosis.\nAnother practical and handy method for an intraoperative identification of ureteric injury involves direct visual inspection of the ureters patency using intravenous dyes such as phenazopyridine or sodium fluorescein to evaluate for any dye leakage along the course of the ureter.19 Its use in a thermal energy-induced injury is limited as there is no immediate leakage of urine owing to its delayed development of ureteric fistula. It usually manifests approximately after 7 days.\nThe role of intraoperative indocyanine green dye for ureteric injury diagnosis by assessing vascularity along the ureter course and assessing vascularity over the ureterureter anastomosis site still requires strong recommendation with a good supporting study.20\nIntraoperative cystoscopy may help to assess ureteral patency by demonstrating urinary jet from the ureteric orifice due to its peristaltic activity. As noted in the literature, the spontaneous, forward, normal peristaltic movement has also been observed in the ureteral segments isolated in vitro or even after inversing a ureteral segment in situ. Consequently, it could be concluded that the nervous system has only a modulatory role in ureteral peristalsis.21 So, the definitive role of intraoperative cystoscopy with visualization of the ureteric jet for the diagnosis of thermal energy-induced ureteric injury is limited. A meta-analysis study by Teeluckdharry, et. al.,22 showed that it does not have any significant detection rate on postoperative ureteric injury. Also, the routine cystoscopy performed at the time of hysterectomy for any benign indication does not lower the rate of delayed lower genitourinary tract injury, on the contrary, it increases the risk of urinary tract infection and further increases the operative time.\nIntraoperatively, if there is a suspicion of ureteric injury, then a very low threshold should be maintained for the visual inspection. The surgical exploration of the retroperitoneum and direct visualization of the ureter is the most accurate method to identify the ureteral injury. The inspection of the ureter should involve the entire course of the pelvis after complete mobilization of the ureter from its peritoneal attachment, and visualization of the complete wall of it circumferentially for any evidence of discoloration, contusion, hemorrhage, or disruption.\nIn the literature there is no consensus on the timing of surgery as some suggest delayed management after 6weeks,11 and others show no difference in outcome between immediate and delayed.12 In our study, the timing for reparative surgery was usually immediate postdiagnosis. In cases with immediate management after diagnosis (cases 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7) available distal ureter end\nJuly\u2013September 2023 Volume 27 Issue 3 e2023.00030 8 JSLS www.SLS.org\nwas approximately 4\u20135 cm and in cases with delayed management (cases 5 and 8) available ureter distal end was 2.5\u20133 cm. Also, intraoperative ureter injury size was more compared to pre-operative imaging findings due to devitalized tissue. This leads to delayed intervention decreasing the chance for UUS due to short distal end length and might increase the chance of failure.\nThe suture material used in our study for LUUS was polyglactin 910 (Vicryl 3-0 or 4-0). Many studies in literature12 support the use of 5-0 or still above numerology polyglactin 910 (Vicryl) for suturing. Early intervention (3weeks) was done in cases (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7) in our study which precludes the use of polyglactin 910 (Vicryl 5-0 or 6-0) sutures owing to tissue inflammation in these cases which will not be able to hold these fine suture material. We have successfully used polyglactin 910 (Vicryl 3-0 or 4-0) in these types of cases with considerable results as well. Some studies were skeptical regarding the increased chances of fibrosis and stricture following the use of polyglactin 910 (Vicryl 3-0 or 4-0), but the same has not been observed in our study. However, further larger comparative studies are required to validate this fact.\nThe shortest distal end of the ureter for anastomosis was 2\u20133 cm in our study. This is well supported by Lee et al,23 which recommends that even if a distal 2-cm end is present for LUUS, we can expect good results without any increased risk of stricture in the future.\nThe literature recommends that ureteric reimplantation can be achieved through a refluxing or nonrefluxing methodology and nonrefluxing reimplantation is usually favored.24 Executing a laparoscopic nonrefluxing ureteric reimplantation is challenging due to an arduous surgical step and difficult ergonomics. This factor is usually vanquished with LUUS, which retains the natural VUR mechanism. Also, the LUUS group had shorter operative time and lesser intraoperative blood loss than the LUN group.25\nPostoperative, the D-J stent was kept in the repaired ureter for a median of 6weeks duration (range 6\u20138weeks). The prolonged stent placement also increases the risk of UTI. According to a study, 2 to 8weeks are required for adequate healing and prevention of stricture post-repair.26 A study by Visser et al,27 suggests a 3 weeks\u2019 time postsurgery as longer renal transplant increases the risk of UTI. Currently, there are no published studies that provide a concrete recommendation regarding the timing of stent removal. Only complaints of UTI in three cases, which were managed by antibiotics have occurred in our study."

While operating near to uterosacral ligament, the ureter is approximately 3 cm away (Figure 8), and the distance may further decrease due to it pulling up in endometriosis cases, so one must be vigilant. The gauze is preferably used for hemostasis instead of a bipolar energy source if required at these sites (Figure 9). The cervicovaginal junction, especially at 2 o\u2019clock and 10 o\u2019clock positions (Figure 10) (vaginal artery location) should be properly coagulated before cutting, as it may get retracted leading to undue overapplication of energy to achieve hemostasis. This may lead to energy delivery to the ureter with its lateral spread and probably increase the chances of ureteric injury. The surgery should be performed cautiously while dissecting the cardinal ligament to avoid taking the posterior pelvic peritoneum (Figure 11). The management of any thermal energy-induced\nJuly\u2013September 2023 Volume 27 Issue 3 e2023.00030 9 JSLS www.SLS.org\ninjury should be done immediately by an implant surgery or UUS, after excising any devitalized tissue rather than only placement of the ureteric stent. If there is viability but with a delayed capillary refill and cyanosed appearance (Figure 12),\nthe D-J stent should be kept. This is not completely therapeutic and in a scenario of strong suspicion for ureteric injury, CT-IVP is suggested. The mode of approach could be by any modality, open or laparoscopy, but minimally invasive surgery is surpassing open with a better vision and depth assessment, and accurate tissue dissection. Furthermore, technically challenging surgeries like LUUS can be made possible with the benefits of minimally invasive surgery such as less blood loss and\nJuly\u2013September 2023 Volume 27 Issue 3 e2023.00030 10 JSLS www.SLS.org\nshorter hospital stay.

The LUUS is a satisfactory surgical option in terms of the operative and subsequent outcomes, but must be managed precisely by an expert.
