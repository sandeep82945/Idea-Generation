1. **Investigate the use of alternative separation techniques:** While the current study employed electrophoretic separation, other techniques such as capillary electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, or field-flow fractionation could be explored to determine if they offer advantages in terms of speed, sensitivity, or resolution.


2. **Expand the panel of mRNA targets:** The current study focused on a panel of 11 mRNA targets, but there may be additional mRNA transcripts that can be used to improve the accuracy and specificity of body fluid identification. Future research could aim to identify and validate a more comprehensive panel of mRNA targets.


3. **Develop a multiplexed assay:** The current study utilized three separate primer panels to amplify the mRNA targets for each body fluid. Future research could focus on developing a single multiplexed assay that would allow for the simultaneous amplification of all the mRNA targets in a single reaction. This would simplify the experimental workflow and reduce the time required for analysis.


4. **Evaluate the performance of the microfluidic platform using real-world forensic samples:** The current study utilized contrived samples to evaluate the performance of the microfluidic platform. Future research should focus on evaluating the performance of the platform using real-world forensic samples, such as those collected from crime scenes or sexual assault victims. This would provide a more realistic assessment of the platform's potential for use in forensic applications.


5. **Explore the potential for on-site analysis:** The microfluidic platform described in the study is relatively compact and portable, making it potentially suitable for on-site analysis of body fluids. Future research could focus on developing a fully integrated system that could be used to perform body fluid identification at crime scenes or other remote locations.
