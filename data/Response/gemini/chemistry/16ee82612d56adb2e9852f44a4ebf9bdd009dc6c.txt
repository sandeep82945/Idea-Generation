1. **Investigate the effects of other oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids on mitochondrial function.** The study only tested five oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids, but there are many other known compounds in this class. It would be interesting to see if these other compounds also have protective effects on mitochondria.
2. **Determine the molecular mechanisms by which oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids protect mitochondria.** The study did not investigate the molecular mechanisms by which oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids protect mitochondria. Future studies could use techniques such as gene expression profiling and proteomics to identify the targets of these compounds.
3. **Test the effects of oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids in animal models of mitochondrial dysfunction.** The study only tested the effects of oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids in cell culture models. Future studies could test these compounds in animal models of mitochondrial dysfunction, such as Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease.
4. **Develop oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids as potential therapeutic agents for mitochondrial dysfunction.** If oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids are found to be effective in animal models of mitochondrial dysfunction, they could be developed as potential therapeutic agents for these diseases.
5. **Investigate the potential synergistic effects of oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids with other mitochondrial protective agents.** Oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids could be used in combination with other mitochondrial protective agents to improve their efficacy. Future studies could investigate the potential synergistic effects of these compounds.
