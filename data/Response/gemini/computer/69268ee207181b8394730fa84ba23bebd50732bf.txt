1. **Investigate the optimal dose of higher-order EF training:** Explore whether increasing the dose of higher-order EF training results in significant improvements in this domain. Determine the optimal dose that allows for positive results in core EFs while maintaining adherence to treatment.


2. **Examine the effects of the intervention on EF manifestations in daily life:** Conduct studies to determine whether the computerized EF intervention can improve EF manifestations in daily life, as measured by rating scales and performance-based tests. Investigate the characteristics of interventions and assessment tools that are most effective in promoting transfer effects to everyday functioning.


3. **Explore the impact of the intervention on children with different MACS levels:** Investigate the effectiveness of the computerized EF intervention in children with CP across all MACS levels. Determine whether adaptations to the intervention or assessment tools are necessary for children with more severe motor impairments.


4. **Investigate the role of nutritional status and sleep disorders in intervention effectiveness:** Examine the relationship between nutritional status, sleep disorders, and the effectiveness of the computerized EF intervention. Determine whether addressing these factors can enhance intervention outcomes.


5. **Evaluate the long-term effects of the intervention beyond 9 months:** Conduct follow-up studies to assess the sustainability of the intervention effects on core EFs and higher-order EFs over an extended period. Determine whether the intervention can lead to lasting improvements in cognitive functioning and daily life performance.
