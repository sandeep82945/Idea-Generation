    "abstractText": "Production and utilization of grey and blue hydrogen is responsible for emission of millions of tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) across the globe. This increased emission of CO2 has severe repercussions on the planet earth and in particular on climate change. Here in, we explored advance bimetallic (BM) CuO/ Ag and trimetallic (TM) CuO/Ag/NiO based nanoporous materials supported with silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) via sol\u2013gel route. The explored nanocatalysts were characterized by Powder X-ray diffraction (P-XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmittance electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and Raman spectroscopic techniques. These advance nanocatalysts were evaluated for the green hydrogen production through electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. The catalysts exhibited an exceptional catalytic performance, the onset potential for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was determined to be \u2212 0.9 V BMSiNPs-GCE and \u2212 0.7 V (vs Ag/AgCl) for TMSiNPs-GCE, whereas \u03b7@10 for BMSiNPs-GCE and TMSiNPs-GCE is \u2212 1.26 and \u2212 1.00 V respectively. Significantly, the TMSiNPs composite and the BMSiNPs composite exhibited superior photochemical H2 evolution rates of 1970.72 mmol h\u22121 g\u22121 and 1513.97 mmol h\u22121 g\u22121, respectively. The TMSiNPs catalyst presents a highly promising material for HER. This study reveals a cost-effective approach to develop sustainable and resourceful electrocatalysts for HER.",

Significantly, the TMSiNPs composite and the BMSiNPs composite exhibited superior photochemical H2 evolution rates of 1970.72 mmol h\u22121 g\u22121 and 1513.97 mmol h\u22121 g\u22121, respectively. The TMSiNPs catalyst presents a highly promising material for HER. This study reveals a cost-effective approach to develop sustainable and resourceful electrocatalysts for HER.\nOver the last century, there has been a substantial acceleration in the worldwide energy consumption attributed to the growth of the population and advancements in global development. Projections indicate a persistent trend of rising energy demand, with an anticipated increase from 16 Terawatts (TW) in 2010 to around 23 TW by 2030. By 2050, it may reach up to 30 TW1. The REN21 Global Status Report (GSR) 2022 shows that while renewable energy deployment is increasing, the shift to a fully sustainable energy system remains slow. Renewables made up 29.3% of global electricity and 12.4% of total energy in 2020, but conventional sources remain dominant at 79.5%. The transition to renewable energy must be accelerated for meeting climate goals and providing universal access to energy2. The heavy reliance on fossil fuels has not only resulted in their rapid depletion but has also caused significant environmental problems and contributed to global warming.\nMolecular hydrogen gas (H2) is a desirable fuel alternative because of its high energy density per unit mass besides the fact that its only byproduct after combustion is non-contaminated water3. It is an outstanding energy carrier and has potential zero emission CO2 release in future and it is sustainable source of energy. However, it is unfortunate that the majority of H2 is now formed via steam reforming of fossil resources, a process that exhibits a measly conversion rate and releases CO2 into the atmosphere. This undoubtedly exacerbates the existing environmental issues. Consequently, it becomes imperative to urgently develop a method for H2 generation that is both clean and renewable, without contributing to further damage to our environment. Such a development is crucial for the positive establishment of a hydrogen economy4. On a more positive note, electrochemical water splitting, or water electrolysis, has gained recognition as a promising substitute to fossil fuels.

By employing water as both the initial molecule and the resulting byproduct in the hydrogen economy cycle, energy can be harnessed through the combustion of H2 while water is simultaneously regenerated. Water electrolysis, a process with its initial documentation dating back to 1789, has gained recognition as a promising alternative to fossil fuels5. It contains two separate half-cell reactions: the HER and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). These reactions play a pivotal role in facilitating the electrolysis of water [H2O (l) \u2192 H2 (g) + 1/2O2 (g), \u0394G\u00b0 = + 237.2\u00a0kJ\u00a0 mol\u22121, \u0394E\u00b0 = 1.23\u00a0V vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)]. This revolutionary process challenges the traditional methods of H2 production and presents a viable pathway towards a greener future.\nGroundbreaking research in electrocatalytic HER via nanoparticles with metal oxides have shown promising results4. Nanoparticles have unique properties that make them ideal candidates for electrocatalytic applications, and their size and shape can be controlled to enhance their catalytic activity. Various metals, including platinum, nickel, cobalt, copper, and molybdenum, have been explored as catalysts, and their performance has been improved through surface modification and hybridization with other materials6\u201310. Platinum is the state of the art of this catalyst for hydrogen evolution due to its high durability and low onset potential, but its scarcity and limiting widespread application due to high costs. Therefore, first row d-block metals, such as copper, have been explored as an alternative9.\nCopper, known for its abundance and cost-effectiveness, has emerged as a compelling option for electrocatalysts in the HER. Various research studies have supported the exceptional catalytic activity of copper-based composites in both electrocatalytic and photocatalytic processes for HER11\u201315. The development of efficient copper-based catalysts holds great significance in advancing large-scale hydrogen production. Recent efforts have focused on synthesizing and characterizing diverse copper-based materials, including bimetallic and trimetallic composites, for their application in HER16\u201319. Copper-based composites demonstrate exceptional electrocatalytic performance with high current densities and low overpotentials, positioning them as a viable substitute to platinum-based catalysts8. Additionally, the utilization of copper-based composites for HER offers an environmentally friendly solution to the pressing carbon emission challenge associated with hydrogen production. Unlike grey and blue hydrogen processes that contribute significantly to climate change through carbon dioxide emissions, copper-based composites provide a greener pathway with significantly reduced carbon emissions20. Several studies have been published that have investigated the field of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for hydrogen production, spanning a wide variety of materials with varied dimensionalities, such as zero-dimensional (0D), one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) structures. These investigations have delved into topics such as the design of materials, synthesis methodologies, characterization techniques, catalytic mechanism investigation, and performance validation or optimization21\u201323.\nIn this study, advanced BM-CuO/Ag and TM-CuO/Ag/NiO-based nanoporous materials supported with silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) were explored via sol\u2013gel route for green hydrogen production by splitting water. The characterization techniques confirmed the successful synthesis of (bimetallic CuO/Ag/SiNPs) BMSiNPs and (trimetallic CuO/Ag/NiO/SiNPs) TMSiNPs nanoporous composite materials. The study revealed significant findings regarding the HER in various composite materials. The onset potential for HER was determined to be \u2012\u00a00.9\u00a0V for BMSiNPs-GCE and \u2012\u00a00.7\u00a0V (vs Ag/AgCl) for TMSiNPs-GCE. The overpotential at a current density of 10\u00a0mA\u00a0 cm\u22122 was found to be \u2012\u00a01.26\u00a0V for BMSiNPs-GCE and \u2012\u00a01.00\u00a0V for TMSiNPs-GCE. Tafel slopes were calculated as 294\u00a0mV\u00a0 dec\u22121 for BMSiNPs-GCE and 270\u00a0mV\u00a0dec mV\u00a0 dec\u22121 for TMSiNPs-GCE. Notably, the composite materials, TMSiNPs and BMSiNPs, demonstrated superior rates of photochemical H2 evolution. The TMSiNPs composite exhibited a remarkable rate of 1970.72\u00a0mmol\u00a0 h\u22121\u00a0 g\u22121, while the BMSiNPs composite displayed a slightly lower but still impressive rate of 1513.97\u00a0mmol\u00a0 h\u22121\u00a0 g\u22121. These findings highlight the commendable performance of these composites in efficiently generating hydrogen gas through photochemical processes. The TMSiNPs catalyst demonstrates promising potential for the HER. Compared to the bimetallic counterpart, the trimetallic composite exhibits superior electrochemical and photochemical HER activity. This enhanced performance is attributed to efficient charge carrier separation and increased active surface area. These findings emphasize the effectiveness of trimetallic composites as catalysts for HER. Further research is necessary to gain deeper insights into the involved mechanisms and explore their applications in sustainable hydrogen production."

The resulting mixture was subjected to aging and calcination following the previously described procedure. It is worth noting that the surfactant Brij S 20, which comprises a hydrophilic polyethylene glycol head and a hydrophobic hydrocarbon tail, plays a crucial role in the synthesis of nanoporous materials. These surfactant molecules adsorb onto the surface of the materials, preventing aggregation and the formation of nanoparticles (Fig.\u00a01)24.\n3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:16909 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-43697-4"

To modify the GCE surface, the initial glassy carbon electrode (b-GCE) was subjected to treatment with a dispersion consisting of BMSiNPs-GCE and TMSiNPs-GCE. The dispersion was prepared by subjecting 5 mg of each nanoporous materials to sonication in 10\u00a0mL of ethanol. Before the alteration of the electrode, meticulous steps were taken, including polishing the GCE surface with alumina slurry, subjecting it to ethanol sonication for 10\u00a0mins, rinsing it with distilled water, allowing it to dry at room temperature, and performing a final cleaning.\nThe dispersed mixture was then drop-casted onto the GCE surface, allowing the solvent to evaporate naturally at ambient temperature. To optimize the electrode performance, the modified GCEs underwent electrochemical activation through cyclic potential sweeps in \u2212\u00a01.0 to +\u00a02.0 V range in a 0.1 M HNO3 solution. This process aimed to attain a stable voltammogram. After each electrochemical study, the electrode surface was purified by carrying out cyclic sweeps in the reverse direction (from 1.0 to 0.0 V) in a 1\u00a0mM NaOH solution. The obtained voltammograms were subsequently calibrated to the potential versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) via a specific equation."

The SiNPs, being highly porous, deliver a large surface area aimed at the interaction among the metal oxides and the surrounding environment. The CuO, Ag, and NiO, being highly oxidative and reducible in nature, readily react with each other to form a composite material. P\u2212XRD analysis of the synthesized BMSiNPs and TMSiNPs composite material showed the presence of distinct diffraction peaks, indicating the successful formation of the composite (Fig.\u00a02B). For BMSiNPs, strong reflections are observed from the (111), (200) and (220) planes of the face-centered cubic (FCC) structure of CuO (JCPDS file no. 03-065-3288) at 36\u00b0, 50\u00b0 and 62\u00b0, respectively. Additionally, intense peaks at 38\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 64\u00b0, 77\u00b0, 82\u00b0 correspond to the (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) planes of Ag FCC structure (JCPDS no. 4.783) and a slight SiNPs hump at 22\u00b0 (Fig.\u00a02B(b))24.\nFor TMSiNPs, the XRD pattern exhibited several prominent peaks at 2\u03b8 values of 38.2\u00b0, 44.6\u00b0, and 64.5\u00b0, which can be attributed to the (111), (200), and (220) crystal planes of face-centered cubic (fcc) silver (Ag), respectively. Additionally, diffraction peaks at 2\u03b8 values of 36.3\u00b0, and 48.0\u00b0 correspond to the (111), and (200) planes of CuO, respectively.

These findings suggest the presence of SiNPs and Ag distributed in the CuO and NiO matrix. Notably, the absence of any other peaks implies a high degree of crystallinity and the absence of noteworthy flaws or contaminants in the composite.\nThe study involves the characterization of nanoporous material made of TMSiNPs using SEM and TEM imaging. In the case of BMSiNPs with surfactant Brij S 20, it has been observed that even after the calcination process, the surfactant molecules remain adsorbed onto the surface of the nanoparticles. This results in the formation of minimal nanoparticle formation, as shown in Fig.\u00a03A at 5 \u00b5m. On the other hand, in the case of TMSiNPs with surfactant Brij S 20 (Fig.\u00a03B,C), the inclusion of NiO increases the porosity of the material and surfactant Brij S 20 acts as a pore-forming agent throughout the calcination process, and the presence of NiO further enhances the pore-forming ability of the surfactant. The NiO nanoparticles act as templates for the formation of pores in the final product, resulting in a higher degree of porosity. With the increase in temperature, the surfactant molecules start to decompose and generate carbonaceous residues. These residues eventually burn off at high temperatures, leaving behind pores in the nanoparticles. Figure\u00a03D and E EDX analysis supports the presence of C in the nanoparticle assembly, indicating the presence of the surfactant fragments in the nanoparticle structure, which supports the generation of porosity by the decomposition of the surfactant Brij S 20.

The peaks for Cu, Si, Ag, Ni, C and O were observed with high intensity of TMSiNPs. No other elemental impurities were detected.\nThe TEM study of BMSiNPs at 500 nm show a bulk nanoporous image that is consistent with the SEM image because the particles in this case are relatively large, and they are not expected to exhibit significant variation at the nanoscale Fig.\u00a0S1A. On the other hand, in the case of TMSiNPs, Fig.\u00a0S1B and C shows the presence of nanoparticles is evident in the TEM images at 100\u00a0nm and 50\u00a0nm due to the reduced size of the particles. The histogram result for TEM images Fig.\u00a0S1B and C of TMSiNPs show the frequency distribution of particle sizes, with the peak of the distribution indicating the most common particle size in the sample. In this case, the histogram analysis of TEM images Fig.\u00a0S1B and C show that the usual particle size of TMSiNPs is around 12\u00a0nm and 19\u00a0nm, respectively. The presence of NiO in the nanoparticle structure is expected to influence the particle size, as NiO can act as a nucleating agent for nanoparticle formation.\nTMSiNPs have a complex chemical environment that can be analysed by XPS. The wide spectrum XPS of TMSiNPs shows the existence of Ag, Cu, Ni, Si, and O elements in the nanoparticles. A combined graph of the XPS spectra of TMSiNPs reveals the binding energy of each element in the nanoparticles, which is useful in understanding the surface chemistry of the nanocomposite. The Cu 2p spectrum shows two foremost peaks at 932.8\u00a0eV and 952.6\u00a0eV, which resemble to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 binding energies, respectively which indicate the presence of Cu in the +\u00a02 oxidation state. The Ag 3d spectrum shows two main peaks at 368.2\u00a0eV and 374.2\u00a0eV, which correspond to Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 binding energies, respectively, indicating the presence of Ag in the metallic state (0 oxidation state). The Ni 2p spectrum shows two main peaks at 853.5 eV and 871.1\u00a0eV, which correspond to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 binding energies, respectively, indicating the presence of Ni in the +\u00a02 oxidation state. The Si\u2013O 2p spectrum shows a main peak at 103.6\u00a0eV, which corresponds to the Si\u2013O binding energy in SiNPs, indicating the presence of Si in the +\u00a04 oxidation state. The O 1s spectrum shows a main peak at 530.1\u00a0eV, which indicating the presence of O in the \u2212\u00a02 oxidation state (Fig.\u00a0S2A\u2013F)24,25.\nRaman spectra of various samples including Fig.\u00a04A pure SiNPs, (B) BMSiNPs, and (C) TMSiNPs, exhibit characteristic peaks that correspond to the vibrational modes of the materials present. The Raman spectra of pure SiNPs show a distinctive peak around 520\u00a0 cm\u22121, which corresponds to the Si\u2013O\u2013Si vibrational mode. The peaks at 502\u00a0 cm\u22121 at corresponds to the symmetric stretching vibration of the Si\u2013O\u2013Si bond, 922\u00a0 cm\u22121 corresponds to the symmetric stretching vibration of the Cu\u2013O bond, and the peak at 1095\u00a0 cm\u22121 corresponds to the asymmetric stretching vibration of the same bond, suggesting the presence of CuO in the sample. The peak at 1395\u00a0 cm\u22121 corresponds to the asymmetric stretching vibration of the Cu\u2013O bond, providing additional evidence of the presence of CuO. The peak at 1403\u00a0 cm\u22121 corresponds to the stretching vibration of the Ag\u2013O bond, demonstrating the presence of Ag in the sample. Finally, the peaks at 1637\u00a0 cm\u22121 and 1828\u00a0 cm\u22121 correspond to the stretching vibrations of the C=C bond and the C=O bond, respectively, which are characteristic peaks of BMSiNPs (Fig.\u00a04B). Finally, the Raman spectra of TMSiNPs (Fig.\u00a04C) exhibit distinctive peaks corresponding to CuO, Ag, NiO, and SiNPs. The intense peak at 567\u00a0 cm\u22121 corresponds to the symmetric stretching vibration of the Si\u2013O bond, the peak at 929\u00a0 cm\u22121 corresponds to the symmetric stretching vibration of the Ni\u2013O bond, while the peak at 976\u00a0 cm\u22121 corresponds to the asymmetric stretching vibration of the same bond, providing evidence of the presence of NiO in the sample. The small peak at 1029\u00a0 cm\u22121 corresponds bending vibration of the Ag\u2013O bond, while the intense peak at 1056\u00a0 cm\u22121 corresponds to the stretching vibration of the same bond, indicating the presence of Ag in the sample. Finally, the peak at 1097\u00a0 cm\u22121 corresponds to the asymmetric stretching vibration of the Cu\u2013O bond, which is a characteristic peak of Cu\u2013O. The peaks detected in the Raman spectra can be used to determine the crystallinity and composition of the nanoparticles.\nElectrochemical Evaluation of HER electrocatalysts in acidic media The LSV technique was used to examine the Electrochemical performance of composite materials based on BMSiNPs and TMSiNPs for HER. The LSV was carried out at 5\u00a0mV\u00a0 s\u22121 scan rate with 0.5\u00a0M H2SO4 electrolyte. The polarization curves for cathodic reactions of all samples are presented in Fig.\u00a05A.\nThe electrochemical production of hydrogen involves multiple steps that occur on the surface of the catalyst (Fig.\u00a06). In acidic conditions, the reaction is believed to follow these steps [Eqs.\u00a0(2)\u2013(4)],\nFigure\u00a04. Raman spectra of (A) pure SiNPs, (B) BMSiNPs and (C) TMSiNPs.\n6 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:16909 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-43697-4\nHere, H* denotes a chemisorbed hydrogen atom located on the active site of the electrocatalyst (M). While the first step is common, the evolution of hydrogen can proceed through either of the latter two steps. To determine the most likely pathway for H2 generation, the Tafel slope is commonly utilized. The theoretically calculated Tafel slope for Pt, a model catalyst, is 29\u00a0mV\u00a0 dec\u22121 assuming that the Tafel step is the rate-determining step (RDS) according to the Butler-Volmer equation. If the Heyrovsky step is the RDS, then the Tafel slope should be 38\u00a0mV\u00a0 dec\u22121. However, if the first step, i.e., discharge or the Volmer step, is the slowest, then the Tafel slope should be 116\u00a0mV\u00a0 dec\u22121 regardless of whether H2 evolution occurs via the latter two steps. It is important to highlight that a smaller Tafel slope value is indicative of a more efficient catalyst for the HER.\nTo facilitate comparison, the dataset includes information for 40% Pt/C and the bare-GCE. It was observed that the GCE had significantly lower activity compared to TMSiNPs-GCE and Pt/C polarization curves. The onset potential for HER was determined to be \u2212 0.9\u00a0V for BMSiNPs-GCE and \u2212 0.7\u00a0V (vs Ag/AgCl) for TMSiNPs-GCE, whereas for Pt/C it was \u2212 0.23\u00a0V (Ag/AgCl)26.\nThe Tafel slope results obtained for the bare-GCE, BMSiNPs-GCE, and TMSiNPs-GCE Fig.\u00a05B indicate that the electrochemical reaction kinetics are influenced by the presence of the composite materials. The lower tafel slope value obtained for the TMSiNPs-GCE is 270\u00a0mV\u00a0 dec\u22121 compared to the BMSiNPs-GCE is 294\u00a0mV\u00a0 dec\u22121\n(2)(Volmer step) H+ +M + e\u2212 \u2194 M \u2212H\u2217\n(3)(Heyrovsky step) M \u2212H\u2217 +H\u2217 + e\u2212 \u2194 M \u2212H2\n(4)(Tafel step) 2 [ M \u2212H \u2217 ] \u2194 2M +H2\nFigure\u00a05.

The maximum current density achieved indicates that the composite materials have good stability and can be used for efficient hydrogen production.\nTo explore the characteristics of the TMSiNPs interface and improve the electrical interaction amongst the electrode and solution, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted at the initial potential of the sample, covering a frequency range from 105 to 1\u00a0Hz, using an alternating current voltage of 5\u00a0mV. The Nyquist plots of the samples are presented in Fig.\u00a07. The TMSiNPs exhibited a charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 12.0\u00a0\u2126 in comparison to BMSiNPs-GCE exhibited (Rct) of 32\u00a0\u2126, indicating a faster rate of electron transfer, which resulted in the acceleration of HER kinetics. This observation was further supported by the Tafel slope values and polarization curves.\nThe electrocatalytic efficacy of BMSiNPs, TMSiNPs in HER was studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) at various scan rates (10\u00a0 mVs\u22121 to 150\u00a0 mVs\u22121) in the non-faradic region to assess the influence of electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl). Therefore, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the catalyst\u2019s (Fig.\u00a0S3A\u2013D) determined by the double layer capacitance (Cdl) is 10.9 and 19.2 (\u00b5F\u00a0 cm\u22122) for BMSiNPs and TMSiNPs respectively. The EIS and ECSA data clearly demonstrate that the trimetallic composite exhibits superior charge transfer and a higher ECSA compared to its bimetallic counterpart. These findings strongly support the notion that the enhanced catalytic activity of the trimetallic composite can be attributed to these factors.

Figure\u00a0931 illustrates the mechanism used for dye-sensitized HER. The process initiates with the absorption of light via Eosin Y (EY), resulting in the production of a photoexcited dye molecule (EY*). This photoexcited state then undergoes intersystem crossing to generate a long-lived excited state known as EY3*. Subsequently, EY3* accepts an electron from TEOA through a process called reductive quenching, leading to the formation of EY\u2212. The electron originating from EY\u2212 is subsequently transferred to the catalyst, where the process of water reduction takes place. Several aspects play a crucial role in the water reduction process on the catalyst\u2019s surface, including efficient light absorption by the dye molecule, effective separation of charge carriers, and efficient electron transfer to the reduction site.

TMSiNPs, in specifically, exhibits an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 21.88%, suggesting its excellent efficiency in this procedure.\nAfter the electron is transferred to the composite materials, the potential difference between the metal and semiconductor nanoparticles causes charge separation, where the excited electrons are relocated to the metal nanoparticles and the holes are transferred to the oxygen molecule in the surrounding environment, creating hydroxyl radicals. The hydroxyl radicals react with water molecules (H2O) to form hydrogen gas (H2) and oxygen molecules (O2). The metal and semiconductor nanoparticles regenerate and continue the photocatalytic process, providing a sustainable source of hydrogen gas. The EIS studies discussed in the previous section explains that the trimetallic composite exhibits better charge transfer properties than the bimetallic counterpart and therefore exhibits better hydrogen evolution rates. Table\u00a0232\u201334, presents a comprehensive comparison of various Cu-related ternary photocatalysts, focusing on their performance in the photocatalytic production of hydrogen."

Our rigorous synthesis and characterization of BMSiNPs and TMSiNPs composite materials confirms their success, paving the way for a game-changing breakthrough. These catalysts, discovered via our research, have demonstrated nothing short of extraordinary performance, excelling in both electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. Our BMSiNPsGCE and TMSiNPsGCE catalysts, in particular, demonstrated outstanding onset potentials for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) at \u2212 0.9\u00a0V and \u2212 0.7\u00a0V (vs Ag/AgCl), respectively.\nFurthermore, the \u03b7@10 values of \u2212 1.26\u00a0V for BMSiNPs \u2212 GCE and \u2212 1.00\u00a0V for TMSiNPs-GCE, as well as the exceptionally low Tafel slopes of 294\u00a0mV\u00a0 dec\u22121 for BMSiNPs-GCE and 270\u00a0mV\u00a0 dec\u22121 for TMSiNPs-GCE, highlight these materials\u2019 outstanding catalytic abilities.\nNotably, the TMSiNPs composite is blazing a path with a photochemical H2 evolution rate of 1970.72\u00a0mmol\u00a0 h\u22121\u00a0 g\u22121, while the BMSiNPs composite shines brightly with a rate of 1513.97\u00a0mmol\u00a0 h\u22121\u00a0 g\u22121.\nOur thorough research, which included EIS and ECSA measurements, backs up these ground-breaking findings, indicating lower resistance to charge transfer and an enlarged ECSA in the trimetallic catalyst. Apart from its scientific value, this finding provides a cost-effective path toward the creation of HER electrocatalysts that are both sustainable and efficient."
