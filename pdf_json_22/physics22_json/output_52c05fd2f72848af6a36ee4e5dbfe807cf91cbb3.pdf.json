    "abstractText": "A method is presented for generating free energies relating to nonlinear constitutive equations with memory from known free energies associated with hereditary linear theories. Some applications to viscoelastic solids and hereditary electrical conductors are presented. These new free energies are then used to obtain estimates for nonlinear integro-differential evolution problems describing the behavior of nonlinear plasmas with memory.",

            "text": "The theory of materials with memory was designed to provide a wide range of material models, including models of viscoelastic materials, dielectrics and heat conductors with memory. The great majority of them can be characterized by memory functionals: reversible changes are described by the instantaneous response while dissipativity is expressed by the dependence on histories (see [1\u20134] and references therein). Usually, the Boltzmann superposition principle was employed to derive a linear constitutive equation for the response of the materials [5]. However, when the behavior of a given material is nonlinear, the Boltzmann superposition principle is not applicable; so a constitutive equation has to be sought by other means. While more than one approach to nonlinear viscoelasticity was being explored in the literature, it is worth mentioning here the pioneering work of Schapery [6]. By means of a time scale shift factor, he derived single-integral nonlinear viscoelastic constitutive equations from the thermodynamic theory of irreversible processes; these equations are very similar to the Boltzmann superposition integral form and, similar to linear viscoelasticity, still consider the strains to be infinitesimal. A different approach has been employed by Findley et al. [7]. To describe nonlinear memory, they considered a polynomial expansion of a multiple-integral expression so that the dependence of strain on the stress history, and vice versa, is nonlinear even for small deformations. The mathematical complexity of this formulation is too complicated for use in many situations. Another approach involves objective rate equations by means of a thermodynamically consistent scheme which naturally allows the construction of nonlinear viscoelastic models (see [8]). More recently, in [9,10], nonlinear mechanical viscous effects are described by assuming a semicontinuum theoretical model with a geometric nonlinearity. Although many nonlinear models with memory have been developed, this topic is open to many important improvements. A method is presented here for generating nonlinear constitutive equations from known linear theories characterized by memory functionals. The novelty of our procedure is based on the properties of the free energy functionals.\nMaterials 2022, 15, 6804. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15196804 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMemory response functionals lead to the difficulty of determining coherent free energy functionals even if the material response is linear [11,12]. A fundamental property of materials with memory is that there is in general no unique free energy density (we henceforth omit \u201cdensity\u201d) associated with a given state but rather a convex set of functionals which obey the requirements of a free energy ([13,14] and earlier references therein). In recent years, explicit formulae have been given for the minimum free energy associated with linear constitutive equations [15\u201317]. The case of fluids is discussed with in [18]. In addition, for relaxation functions given by sums of decaying exponentials (discrete spectrum model) and generalizations of these, explicit expressions have been presented for the maximum and intermediate free energies [19\u201321]. Based on this work, an expression for a more centrally located free energy has been presented [21]. Both the isothermal and non-isothermal cases have been considered [22,23]. If the relaxation function is an integral over decaying exponentials (continuous spectrum model and generalizations), then an explicit expression can be given for the minimum free energy [24]. In this case, the maximum free energy is the work function [21,23,25]. Free energies relating to heat conductors with memory are considered in [26]. There are similarities between such materials, as described in [27], and electrical conductors with memory, which are of interest in the present work. The concept of equivalent classes of states or minimal states, based on the work of Noll [28], is explored in the context of linear models [29\u201331]. One recent result is that for materials with relaxation functions given by sums of exponentials and generalizations of these, the minimal states are usually non-singleton, while for integrals over exponentials, they are singleton [21,23,25]. A more general point of view on this topic is adopted on page 365 of [1]. In the early sections, free energies with quadratic memory terms\u2014which yield constitutive equations with linear memory terms\u2014are discussed. A method is presented for generating free energies and nonlinear constitutive equations from known free energies associated with linear theories ([1], p. 112). Examples are discussed for nonlinear viscoelastic theories. Such new free energies are then used to prove a boundedness result for integro-differential equations describing the behavior of nonlinear electromagnetic systems, specifically electrical conductors with memory. In Section 2, the central result concerning free energies for nonlinear systems is proved on a general vector space\u2014which may be taken as relating to mechanical, thermal or electromagnetic systems or a combination of these. Minimal states are defined and discussed. In Section 3, free energies with quadratic memory terms and higher-order contributions are considered. The issue of whether the quadratic memory terms are positive definite or positive semi-definite is relevant for applications in later sections. This question is explored in Section 4 in the context of minimal states. In Section 5, examples relating to viscoelastic materials are discussed, while in Sections 6 and 7, electrical conductors with memory are considered, and we obtain estimates for nonlinear integro-differential evolution problems describing the behavior of nonlinear plasmas with memory. While the discussion of these sections is assumed to apply to a small element of the body B \u2282 R3 centered at a point x \u2208 B, we shall omit explicit mention of x. Material deformation, while implicitly included in the general developments of Section 2, are not of primary interest in the present work.\nNotation.

            "text": "We consider, in this section, a method for generating free energies relating to systems with nonlinear, memory-dependent constitutive equations. Independent and dependent field variables will be defined on a general vector space V . Let \u039bt : R+ 7\u2192 V and\n\u039b : R 7\u2192 V be the history and present value of the independent field variable, where the standard notation\n\u039bt(s) = \u039b(t\u2212 s), s \u2208 R+ (1) is understood. The dependent field variable \u03a3 : R 7\u2192 V is given by a constitutive relation\n\u03a3(t) = \u03a3\u0303(\u039bt, \u039b(t)).\nWe will assume that \u039b(\u00b7) belongs to a suitable function space with norm \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016. As noted earlier, the free energy associated with a given state of the material is not in general a uniquely defined quantity. Free energies associated with a given state form a bounded convex set F [14]. Let us denote by \u03c8 : R 7\u2192 R+ a member of F . We have\n\u03c8(t) = \u03c8\u0303 ( \u039bt, \u039b(t) ) , (2)\nwhere \u03c8\u0303 is a nonlinear continuously differentiable function of the present value \u039b(t) and a nonlinear functional of the history \u039bt with a Fr\u00e9chet differential that is continuous in its arguments. The static or equilibrium history is given by\n\u039b\u2020(s) = \u039b(t), s \u2208 R+. (3)\nIn particular, 0\u2020 denotes the zero history,\n0\u2020(s) = 0, s \u2208 R+,\nwhere 0 is the zero vector in V . Note that the requirement\n\u03c8\u0303(0\u2020, 0) = 0 (4)\nis imposed on all free energies. This eliminates the arbitrary constant associated with all physical energies. However, the intrinsic arbitrariness associated with free energies of materials with memory remains (see [32\u201334]).\nWe define the equilibrium free energy by\n\u03c6(t) = \u03c6\u0303(\u039b(t)) := \u03c8\u0303 ( \u039b\u2020, \u039b(t) ) . (5)\nit is assumed that this is a positive definite function of \u039b(t). The quantity\nW(t) = W\u0303(\u039bt, \u039b(t)),\nis the work function, which represents the work completed on the element up to time t. It is assumed to be given by\nW(t) = \u222b t \u2212\u221e \u03a3(s) \u00b7 \u039b\u0307(s)ds, (6)\nwhere the superimposed dot represents time differentiation and the centered dot represents the scalar product in V . The convergence of the integral in relation (6) imposes restrictions on the behavior of \u039b in the distant past. The work completed over the time interval [t1, t2] is given by\nW(t1, t2) = \u222b t2\nt1 \u03a3(s) \u00b7 \u039b\u0307(s)ds. (7)\nBased on consequences of the second law of thermodynamics derived in [32,35], in a continuum mechanics context (and easily generalizable to other dissipitive systems, including electromagnetism [36]), we assign the following (defining) properties to a free energy [14,32,35]:\nProperty 1. \u2202\u03c8(t) \u2202\u039b(t) = \u03a3(t), (8)\nwhere \u03a3 : R 7\u2192 V is the dependent field variable.\nProperty 2. For any history \u039bt and present value \u039b(t)\n\u03c8\u0303(\u039bt, \u039b(t)) \u2265 \u03c6\u0303(\u039b(t)). (9)\nProperty 3. Finally, assuming that \u039b is continuously differentiable,\n\u03c8\u0307(t) \u2264 W\u0307(t) = \u03a3(t) \u00b7 \u039b\u0307(t). (10)\nThese are referred to as the Graffi conditions for a free energy. The relationship between them and the Coleman and Owen [37] definition of a free energy are explored, for a linear theory, by Del Piero and Deseri [30,31]; see also [15]. Note that equality occurs by definition in Property 2 for the static history. Together with the condition (4), Property 2 implies that all free energies are non-negative-valued functions.\nDefinition 1. We say that a non-negative-valued function \u03c8 \u2265 0 is positive definite if it is zero only for the zero history, \u039bt = 0\u2020, and the current zero value \u039b(t) = 0; otherwise, it is positive semi-definite.\nWe can write (10) as an equality in the form\n\u03c8\u0307(t) +D(t) = W\u0307(t), (11)\nwhere D(t) := W\u0307(t)\u2212 \u03c8\u0307(t) \u2265 0 is the rate of dissipation. The work function has Properties 1\u20133 of a free energy, though for zero rate of dissipation. However, it does not have a fourth property, as discussed on page 435 of [1], which applies to all other known free energies. This relates to the fact that for a long established periodic history, we must have \u03c8(t + T) = \u03c8(t), where T is the period of the history. This may not crucially affect the usage of W(t) as a free energy in all circumstances, but it should be considered with caution. Let us now state and prove the central result of this section. Let \u03c81(t), \u03c82(t), . . . , \u03c8n(t) be a set of n free energies relating to a state (\u039bt, \u039b(t)) in a given material or perhaps in different materials at time t. To allow for the latter possibility, we assign to each \u03c8i(t), i = 1, 2, . . . n, different constitutive equations\n\u03a3i(t) = \u03a3\u0303i(\u039bt, \u039b(t)),\nand work functions Wi(t) , where\nWi(t) = \u222b t \u2212\u221e \u03a3i(s) \u00b7 \u039b\u0307(s)ds.\nAccordingly, \u2202\u03c8i(t) \u2202\u039b(t) = \u03a3i(t), i = 1, 2, . . . n (12)\nand \u03c8\u0307i(t) \u2264 W\u0307i(\u039bt, \u039b(t)) = \u03a3i(t) \u00b7 \u039b\u0307(t), i = 1, 2, . . . n.\nIf all the free energies belong to the same material, the dependent field variables \u03a3i are all equal, and the index i refers to different free energies of the same material.\nProposition 1. The quantity\n\u03c8(t) = f (\u03c81(t), \u03c82(t), . . . \u03c8n(t)) (13)\nis a free energy for the state (\u039bt, \u039b(t)) with the dependent field given by\n\u03a3(t) = n\n\u2211 i=1 \u2202 f \u2202\u03c8i(t) \u03a3i(t), (14)\nprovided that f : (R+)n 7\u2192 R+ has the properties\n\u2202 f \u2202yi (y1, y2, . . . , yn) \u2265 0, i = 1, 2, . . . n, (15)\nand f (0, 0, . . . 0) = 0. (16)\nProof. We have\n\u03c8\u0307(t) = n\n\u2211 i=1 \u2202 f \u2202\u03c8i(t) \u03c8\u0307i(t) \u2264 n \u2211 i=1 \u2202 f \u2202\u03c8i(t) \u03a3i(t) \u00b7 \u039b\u0307(t) = \u03a3(t) \u00b7 \u039b\u0307(t)\nwhere \u03a3 is defined by (14). Moreover, from (11), we obtain the rate of dissipation\nD(t) = n\n\u2211 i=1 \u2202 f \u2202\u03c8i(t) Di(t) \u2265 0. (17)\nThese relations essentially state Property 3. In addition, by virtue of (12) and (14),\n\u2202\u03c8(t) \u2202\u039b(t) = \u03a3(t), (18)\nwhich is Property 1. It follows from (13), by taking the stationary limit of the history \u039bt, that\n\u03c6(t) = f (\u03c61(t), \u03c62(t), . . . \u03c6n(t)) \u2264 f (\u03c81(t), \u03c82(t), . . . \u03c8n(t)) = \u03c8(t), (19)\nwhich is Property 2. Finally, by virtue of (16), \u03c8 satisfies the normalization condition (4) since every \u03c8i, i = 1, 2, . . . n has this property.\nThis result allows us to build free energies and constitutive dependent fields relating to nonlinear systems from those associated with basic constitutive equations with linear memory terms (for which many explicit forms exist [15\u201322,38]) though, in fact, the \u03c8i, i = 1, 2, . . . n may be any choice of free energies. Specifically, the result can be used as follows: assume we have a nonlinear dependent field variable of the form (14), where f obeys (15) and \u03a3i is determined by (12). Then, (13) immediately yields a free energy with a rate of dissipation given by (17) and dependent variable \u03a3(t) generated through (18). This is the way it is used in Sections 5.1 and 6.1.\nTaking f to be an analytic function of its arguments at the origin, we can write\n\u03c8(t) = n\n\u2211 i=1\n\u03bbi\u03c8i(t) + n\n\u2211 j,k=1 \u00b5jk\u03c8j(t)\u03c8k(t) + higher powers. (20)\nA constant term is excluded by (4) and (16). If we omit higher powers, assumption (15) takes the form\n\u03bbi + n\n\u2211 k=1 (\u00b5ik + \u00b5ki)\u03c8k(t) \u2265 0, i = 1, 2, . . . n.\nIn particular, taking \u03c8 to be a linear combination of the \u03c8i, it follows that\n\u03bbi \u2265 0, i = 1, 2, . . . n. (21)\nIf we are dealing with free energies relating to the same linear material with dependent field \u03a3`, then \u03a3i(t) = \u03a3`(t), i = 1, . . . , n, and (14) becomes\n\u03a3(t) = \u03ba(t)\u03a3`(t), \u03ba(t) = n\n\u2211 i=1 \u2202 f \u2202\u03c8i(t) .\nIn the linear case, \u03a3(t) = \u03a3`(t) and then \u03ba(t) = 1. When higher powers are neglected in (20), this gives\nn\n\u2211 i=1 \u03bbi :=\n( n\n\u2211 i=1 \u2202 f \u2202\u03c8i(t) )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03c81=\u03c82=\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7=0 = 1 (22)\nwhich, together with (21), amounts to convexity.\nRemark 1. Relations (21) and (22) must hold in the general case, with higher powers included, if states exist for which the higher powers are negligible.\n2.1. Relative Histories We can write (2) in the form\n\u03c8(t) = \u03c8\u0302 ( \u039btr, \u039b(t) ) , (23)\nwhere \u039btr is the relative history defined by\n\u039btr(s) = \u039b t(s)\u2212\u039b(t). (24)\nProperty 1, given by (8), becomes\n\u2202 \u2202\u039b(t) \u03c8\u0302 ( \u039btr, \u039b(t) ) \u2212 D\u039b\u03c8\u0302 ( \u039btr, \u039b(t) ) = \u03a3\u0302(\u039btr, \u039b(t)) = \u03a3(t), (25)\nwhere the second term on the left is defined by the requirement that, for any \u039b(t),\nD\u039b\u03c8\u0302 ( \u039btr, \u039b(t) ) \u00b7\u039b(t) = \u03b4\u03c8\u0302 ( \u039btr, \u039b(t) \u2223\u2223\u039b\u2020). (26) The quantity \u03b4\u03c8\u0302 is the Fr\u00e9chet differential of \u03c8\u0302 at \u039btr in the direction \u039b\n\u2020 which denotes a static history given by (3), for arbitrary \u039b(t). We put\n\u03c8\u0302 ( \u039btr, \u039b(t) ) = \u03c6\u0303(\u039b(t)) + \u03c8\u0302r ( \u039btr, \u039b(t) ) = \u03c6(t) + \u03c8r(t) (27)\nwhere \u03c6\u0303, defined by (5), is given here by\n\u03c6\u0303(\u039b(t)) = \u03c8\u0302 ( 0\u2020, \u039b(t) )\n(28)\nand \u03c8\u0302r = \u03c8\u0302\u2212 \u03c6\u0303 \u2265 0 represents the history-dependent part of the free energy.\n2.2. Summed Histories It is sometimes the case, as in one of the physical configurations dealt with in later sections (and in [26]), that the work function has the form\nW(t) = \u222b t \u2212\u221e \u03a3(s) \u00b7\u039b(s)ds, (29)\nwith no time derivative on the independent field. Formally, we transform this into (6) as follows: define the summed past history by\n\u039b\u0302(t) = \u222b t\n0 \u039b(u)du = \u222b t 0 \u039bt(s)ds, \u039b\u0302 t (u) = \u039b\u0302(t\u2212 u). (30)\nThen, we can write (29) in the form W(t) = \u222b t \u2212\u221e \u03a3(u) \u00b7 \u02d9\u0302\u039b(u)du (31)\nand treat the quantity \u039b\u0302 as the independent field variable. Let\n\u039b\u0302 t r(s) = \u039b\u0302(t)\u2212 \u039b\u0302 t (s) = \u222b t t\u2212s \u039b(u)du. (32)\nNote that the relative summed history \u039b\u0302 t r has the opposite sign to \u039b t r defined by (24),\nwhich is a choice that is more convenient in this context. Dependence on \u039b\u0302(t) cannot occur in the free energy or any other physical quantity. This is because the summed past history depends on the choice of the origin of the time variable. Thus,\n\u03c8(t) = \u03c8\u0302 ( \u039b\u0302 t r, \u039b\u0302(t) ) = \u03c8\u0302 ( \u039b\u0302 t r ) . (33)\nIn addition, \u03c6(t) drops out (see (28)) and\n\u03c8(t) = \u03c8\u0302r ( \u039b\u0302 t r ) .

Minimal States We now introduce the concept of a minimal state. This is an equivalence class of histories defined as follows [20,28\u201331]. The state of our system at a fixed time t is specified by the history and present value St = (\u039bt, \u039b(t)). Let two states St1 = (\u039b t 1, \u039b1(t)), St2 = (\u039b t 2, \u039b2(t)) have the property that\n\u03a3\u0303(\u039bt+s1 , \u039b1(t + s)) = \u03a3\u0303(\u039b t+s 2 , \u039b2(t + s)), s \u2208 R+, (36)\n\u039b\u0307 t+s 1 (u) = \u039b\u0307 t+s 2 (u), 0 \u2264 u \u2264 s, (37)\nthen St1, S t 2 are said to be in the same equivalence class or minimal state. The latter terminology was introduced in [20]. Thus, if they have the same output from time t onwards, they are equivalent histories. The derivatives in (37) arise from the definition of a process in terms of the independent field variable ([14] for example). Requirement (37) means that \u039b1(u), \u039b2(u) differ by at most a constant for u \u2265 t. Note that, for two equivalent states, we have W1(t, t + s) = W2(t, t + s), s \u2208 R where W1 is the quantity defined by (7) for St1 and W2 is that quantity for S t 2.\nRemark 2. A fundamental distinction in the present work is whether the material under discussion has minimal states that are singletons, i.e., St = (\u039bt, \u039b(t)) is the minimal state, or they contain more than one member.\nObserve that property (36) requires that \u2202\n\u2202\u039b1(t + s) \u03c8(\u039bt+s1 , \u039b1(t + s)) =\n\u2202\n\u2202\u039b2(t + s) \u03c8(\u039bt+s2 , \u039b2(t + s)), s \u2208 R+ (38)\nfor St1, S t 2 in the same minimal state."

(44)\nThe form (39) emerges by expanding the general functional in (27) to include quadratic terms and neglecting any dependence on \u039b(t) in the kernel ([23], for example and [1], p. 149). The linear term is omitted because it is inconsistent with the requirement that \u03c8 be positive definite. The quantity \u03c8 will be a valid free energy provided certain conditions are imposed on the kernel IL12, which in particular must be a non-negative operator so that the second term on the right of (43) is non-negative.\nNoting (41), we define IL0(u) = IL(0, u) = IL>(u, 0), IL\u20320(u) = \u2212 \u222b \u221e\n0 IK(s1, u)ds1, (45)\nwhere the prime indicates differentiation with respect to the argument.

Thermodynamic arguments can be used to show that ILe = IL>e , IL0(0) = IL > 0 (0),\nusing an adaption of a technique described in [14], for example. Here, the second property is a consequence of (45). In earlier work on free energies, involving tensor constitutive relations [15,18\u201320,22,23,40], it is also assumed that\nIL0(u) = IL>0 (u), u \u2208 R+, (49)\na condition which cannot be deduced from (40) or from thermodynamics.

The latter vanishes at \u03c9 = 0. It is a consequence of the second law that ([14,36], for example)\nIL\u20320s(\u03c9) < 0 , \u2200\u03c9 \u2208 R++, (56)\nfor dissipative materials.\nNonlinear Models Let \u03c8i(t), i = 0, 1, 2, be given as in (39),\n\u03c8i(t) = \u03c6i(t) + \u03c8i(r)(t), \u03c6i(t) = \u03c6\u0303i(\u039b(t))\n\u03c8i(r)(t) = 1 2 \u222b \u221e 0 \u222b \u221e 0 \u039btr(s1) \u00b7 IK(i)(s1, s2)\u039btr(s2)ds1ds2,\nand satisfy Properties 1\u20133.

In particular, taking into account that\n\u039btr(s1) \u00b7 IK(i)(s1, s2)\u039btr(s2) = IK(i)(s1, s2) : [\u039btr(s1)\u2297\u039btr(s2)],\nwhere \u2297 denotes the dyadic product, we can write\n\u03c8(t) = \u03c60(t) + \u03c61(t)\u03c62(t) + \u03c80(r)(t) + \u03c61(t)\u03c82(r)(t) + \u03c62(t)\u03c81(r)(t)\n+ 1 4 \u222b R4+ IK(1)(s1, s2)\u2297 IK(2)(s3, s4) : 4\u2297 j=1 \u039btr(sj)d 4s,\nwhere Rn+ = (R+)n, n \u2208 IN,\ndns = ds1ds2...dsn, n\u2297\nj=1 \u039btr(sj) = \u039b t r(s1)\u2297\u039btr(s2)\u2297 ...\u2297\u039btr(sn),\nand IK(1) \u2297 IK(2) is a fourth-order tensor belonging to Lin(Lin(V)). With a little abuse of notation, the double dot here denotes the scalar product in Lin(Lin(V)).\nFrom (14), we have\n\u03a3(t) = \u03a30(t) + \u03c82(t)\u03a31(t) + \u03c81(t)\u03a32(t), (58)\nwhere \u03a3i denotes the dependent field related to \u03c8i, i = 0, 1, 2, which is given by\n\u03a3i(t) = \u03a3\u0303 (i) e (\u039b(t)) + \u222b \u221e 0 [IL(i)0 ] \u2032(u)\u039btr(u)du\n= \u03a3\u0303 (i) e (\u039b(t))\u2212 \u222b \u221e 0 \u222b \u221e 0 IK(i)(s1, u)\u039btr(u) ds1du.\nThe special case where \u03c81 = \u03c82 and \u03a31 = \u03a32 is the basis of developments in Section 5.1 and other sections.\nMoreover, according to (17), the nonlinear rate of dissipation has the form\nD(t) = D0(t) +D1(t)\u03c82(t) +D2(t)\u03c81(t)\nwhere\nDi(t) = 1 2 \u222b \u221e 0 \u222b \u221e 0 \u039b\u0307 t (s1) \u00b7 ID(i)(s1, s2)\u039b\u0307t(s2)ds1ds2\nID(i)(s1, s2) =\u2212 \u2202\n\u2202s1 IL(i)(s1, s2)\u2212\n\u2202\n\u2202s2 IL(i)(s1, s2),\nIL(i) being related to IK(i) as indicated by (41). A more general expression, say \u03c8nl , can be obtained by the functional Taylor expansion of \u03c6\u0303 and \u03c8\u0302r in (27) and neglecting the third-order terms because \u03c8nl must be non-negative. We let\n\u03c8nl(t) = \u03c6\u0303nl(\u039b(t)) + 1 2 \u222b R2+ H0(\u039b(t), s1, s2) : 2\u2297 j=1 \u039btr(sj)d 2s\n+ 1 4 \u222b R4+ H(s1, s2, s3, s4) : 4\u2297 j=1 \u039btr(sj)d 4s (59)\nwhere H0 and H are second and fourth-order tensors on V , respectively. Any dependence of H on \u039b(t) is neglected. Further constraints must be placed on H0 and H to ensure that \u03c8nl has the required Properties 1\u20133 of a free energy. Here, we will limit ourselves to observing that (57) is recovered from (59) by letting\n\u03c6nl(t) = \u03c60(t) + \u03c61(t)\u03c62(t), H(s1, s2, s3, s4) = IK(1)(s1, s2)\u2297 IK(2)(s3, s4),\nH0(\u039b(t), s1, s2) = IK(0)(s1, s2) + \u03c6\u03031(\u039b(t))IK(2)(s1, s2) + \u03c6\u03032(\u039b(t))IK(1)(s1, s2).\nWhen summed past histories are involved, \u03c8 reduces to \u03c8r, as stated in (34), and therefore, we can simply choose\n\u03c8nl(t) = 1 2 \u222b R2+ H0(s1, s2) : 2\u2297 j=1 \u039b\u0302 t r(sj)d 2s\n+ 1 4 \u222b R4+ H(s1, s2, s3, s4) : 4\u2297 j=1 \u039b\u0302 t r(sj)d 4s, (60)\nwhere \u039b\u0302 t r denotes the reduced summed history. In particular, (57) is recovered provided that\nH0 = IK(0), H(s1, s2, s3, s4) = IK(1)(s1, s2)\u2297 IK(2)(s3, s4)."

We introduce the relation\n\u039b1(t) = \u039b2(t) (65)\nas an extra condition in the definition of a minimal state. It follows from (64) that (61) holds. We shall sometimes refer to the equivalence or otherwise of histories, omitting the mention of present values, when the former are central to the argument. The linearity of the functional It means that the requirement of the equivalence of \u039bt1 and \u039bt2 is the same as that \u039b t 1 \u2212\u039bt2 be equivalent to the zero history. Thus, if the minimal state including the zero history is singleton (non-singleton), then all minimal states are singleton (non-singleton). In the arguments that follow, we introduce certain results obtained for the minimum, maximum and other free energies in [15,17,20] and related work, without developing the detailed apparatus.\nLet \u03c8r in (27) have the form\n\u03c8r(t) = \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e |f(\u03c9, \u039btr)|2d\u03c9 (66)\nwhere f : R \u2192 C is a linear functional of the history \u039btr with the property that\nf(\u03c9, \u039bt1r) = f(\u03c9, \u039b t 2r), \u2200\u03c9 \u2208 R, (67)\nif and only if \u039bt1r and \u039b t 2r are equivalent histories. The quantity f is thus a functional of the minimal state. We have\nf(\u03c9, \u039bt) = 0, \u03c9 \u2208 R \u21d0\u21d2 It(s, \u039bt) = 0, s \u2208 R+. (68)\nIf states are equivalent to the zero state, usually in the context of the difference of two equivalent states, the present value is zero, and a distinction between actual and relative histories is unnecessary.\nRemark 3. The form (66) applies to the minimum, maximum and a family of intermediate free energies given in [15,17,20,21]. In these cases, f(\u03c9, \u039btr) is defined on the frequency domain.\nLet f(\u03c9, \u039btr) = \u222b \u221e 0 IU(\u03c9, u)\u039btr(u)du, (69)\nso that IL12(u1, u2) = \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e IU\u2217(\u03c9, u1)IU(\u03c9, u2)d\u03c9, (70) where IU\u2217 is the Hermitian conjugate of IU. It follows from (66) and (67) that the free energy is itself a functional of the minimal state so that if ( \u039bt1r, \u039b1(t) ) , ( \u039bt2r, and\u039b2(t) ) are equivalent states, then\n\u03c8\u0302 ( \u039bt1r, \u039b1(t) ) = \u03c8\u0302 ( \u039bt2r, \u039b2(t) ) \u039b1(t) = \u039b2(t).\n(71)\nRelation (38) follows automatically, but it is not necessary to assume (71) for this relation to be true. Let us introduce the scalar product notation\n\u3008\u039bt1, \u039bt2\u3009 = 1 2 \u222b \u221e 0 \u222b \u221e 0 \u039bt1(s1) \u00b7 IL12(s1, s2)\u039bt2(s2)ds1ds2 = \u3008\u039bt2, \u039bt1\u3009 (72)\nThe free energy is given by\n\u03c8(t) = \u03c6(t) + \u3008\u039btr, \u039btr\u3009 = S(t) + \u3008\u039bt, \u039bt\u3009 (73)\nwhere S is defined by (51). We now prove certain results for free energies, using this bracket notation ([1], p. 173).\nProposition 2. If the free energy is a functional of the minimal state and if \u039bt1, \u039b t 2 are equivalent histories, then \u3008\u039bt1, \u039bt1\u3009 = \u3008\u039bt2, \u039bt2\u3009 = \u3008\u039bt1, \u039bt2\u3009, t \u2208 R+. (74)\nProof. The first equality in (74) follows from the definition of equivalence, on noting that S, and more obviously \u03c6, are equal for the states (\u039bt1, \u039b(t)), (\u039b t 2, \u039b(t)) at time t, s \u2208 R+. We also have \u3008\u039btd, \u039btd\u3009 = 0, \u039btd = \u039bt1 \u2212\u039bt2. (75) since \u039btd is equivalent to the zero state. Thus, the last equality in (74) can be deduced using the bilinearity of the scalar product.\nIt follows from Proposition 2 that\n\u3008\u039bt1, \u039btd\u3009 = \u3008\u039bt2, \u039btd\u3009 = 0. (76)\nProposition 3. For a free energy with a history-dependent part of the form (66), the statement that \u3008\u039bt, \u039bt\u3009, is positive semi-definite; i.e., it vanishes for some non-zero \u039bt1, and it is true if and only if the minimal states are non-singleton.\nProof. If, for the non-zero history \u039bt1, the quantity I t(u, \u039bt) vanishes for u \u2265 0; in other words, if \u039bt1 is equivalent to the zero history and the minimal states are non-singleton, then, from (75), \u3008\u039bt, \u039bt\u3009 vanishes at \u039bt1 and is non-negative.\nIf \u3008\u039bt, \u039bt\u3009 vanishes for the non-zero history \u039bt1, then, from (66), f(\u03c9, \u039bt) = 0 and by (68), we have that It(s, \u039bt), s \u2265 0 vanishes, and the minimal states are non-singleton since \u039bt1 is non-zero.\nIn [21,23] (and also [1], p. 168), materials are characterized by the singularity types in the complex frequency plane of the Fourier transform of the derivative of the relaxation function. If this quantity has only isolated singularities (corresponding to a relaxation function consisting of sums of decaying exponentials, possibly multiplying polynomials and trigonometric functions) then minimal states are non-singleton. If the singularities characterizing a material include branch cuts, then the minimal states are singletons [24] (see also [36], p. 499). This is the case of main interest in the present work. We adopt a different viewpoint on free energies and constitutive equations in this work. The standard thermodynamical point of view is to specify a free energy and deduce a constitutive relation from this. Alternatively, an applications-oriented approach, which is now adopted, involves deciding on a constitutive equation and searching for a free energy that yields this relation. This latter step may not be easy.\n4.1. Quadratic Free Energies for Singleton Materials We make the assumption in the following sections that the materials are such that their minimal states are singletons. This implies that the free energies, at least in the categories specified in Proposition 3, are positive definite functionals of the history.\n4.1.1. The Graffi Free Energy Let (46)\u2013(47) be the constitutive relations of the dependent field on a general vector space. A corresponding free energy is the Graffi functional, which is given by\n\u03c8G(t) = \u03c6(t)\u2212 1 2 \u222b \u221e 0 \u039btr(s) \u00b7 IL\u20320(s)\u039btr(s)ds. (77)\nIt satisfies Properties 1\u20133 of a free energy only if\nIL\u20320(s) < 0, IL \u2032\u2032 0 (s) \u2265 0 \u2200s \u2208 R, (78)\nso that these conditions are assumed to hold. The rate of dissipation is\nDG(t) = 1 2 \u222b \u221e 0 \u039btr(s) \u00b7 IL\u2032\u20320 (s)\u039btr(s)ds \u2265 0. (79)\nEquation (77) can be written in the form (39) as indicated on page 238 of [1]. Let us assume that\nIL\u2032\u20320 (s) + \u03bbIL \u2032 0(s) \u2265 0, s \u2208 R+. (80)\nIt will be true, for instance, if IL\u20320(u) consists of sums (or integrals) of decaying exponentials multiplying non-negative coefficients (or a non-negative function) with dominant term proportional to e\u2212\u03bbu. It follows that\nDG(t) \u2265 \u03bb[\u03c8(t)\u2212 \u03c6(t)]. (81)\nThe Graffi free energy is not in general a functional of the minimal state [30]. It is, however, a positive definite functional of the history, by virtue of the first inequality in (78) and a positive definite function of the present value by virtue of the assumption after (5).\n4.1.2. The Work Function Recalling the first equality in (46) we put\n\u03a3h(t) = \u222b \u221e\n0 IL\u20320(u)\u039b t r(u)du = \u222b t \u2212\u221e IL\u20320(t\u2212 s)(\u039b(s)\u2212\u039b(t))ds.\nUsing (47), the total work performed on the material, given by (6), can be expressed in the form\nW(t) = \u222b t \u2212\u221e \u03a3e(u) \u00b7 \u039b\u0307(u)du + \u222b t \u2212\u221e \u03a3h(u) \u00b7 \u039b\u0307(u)du\n= \u222b t \u2212\u221e d\u03c6(\u039b(u)) d\u039b(u) \u00b7 \u039b\u0307(u)du + \u222b t \u2212\u221e \u222b u \u2212\u221e IL\u20320(u\u2212 s)(\u039b(s)\u2212\u039b(u))ds \u00b7 \u039b\u0307(u)du\n= \u03c6(t) + 1 2 \u222b t \u2212\u221e \u222b t \u2212\u221e (\u039b(s)\u2212\u039b(t)) \u00b7 IK0(|s\u2212 u|)(\u039b(u)\u2212\u039b(t))duds,\nwhere IK0(|s\u2212 u|) = \u2202\u2202s \u2202\u2202u IL0(|s\u2212 u|). Then, we conclude that\nW(t) = \u03c6(t) + 1 2 \u222b \u221e 0 \u222b \u221e 0 \u039btr(s) \u00b7 IK0(|s\u2212 u|)\u039btr(u)duds. (82)\nThis is a special example of (39) with IL(s, u) = IL0(|s\u2212 u|). However, IL12 has singular delta function behavior [40] and is therefore not bounded. We emphasize that the work function obeys the properties of a free energy with zero dissipation rate, D(t) = 0, t \u2208 R+ [33,41,42]. We denote by \u03c8M the work function, given by (82), since it is the maximum free energy for singleton materials, but it is not in general a functional of the minimal state [30]. It is a positive definite function of \u039b(t) and a positive definite functional of the history, which is clear from its representation in the frequency domain [15]. In particular, for singleton materials, it can be shown that\n\u03c8G(t) \u2264 \u03c8M(t)."

            "text": "In the sequel, the vector space V is Sym, the subspace of symmetric second-order tensors on R3. In addition, memory kernels take values in Lin(V) = Lin(Sym), which represents the space of fourth-order tensors. Let E \u2208 V and T \u2208 V denote the strain and the stress, respectively. Using the notation (1), Et denotes the strain history and E\u2020 denotes the constant strain history of value E(t),\nE\u2020(s) = E(t) , s \u2265 0 .\nA material is viscoelastic if the stress tensor T not only depends on the current value of the strain but also on its history:\nT(t) = T\u0303(E(t), Et).\nThe dependence of T and E on the space variable x is understood but not written. The linear constitutive equation for a viscoelastic body is given by\nT\u0303(E(t), Et) = G0E(t) + \u222b \u221e\n0 G\u2032(s)Et(s)ds, (83)\nwhere the memory kernel G\u2032 : R+ \u2192 Lin(V) is a summable and continuous fourthorder tensor-valued function. It is of interest to compare this with the more general relation (46). Let\nG(t) = G0 + \u222b t\n0 G\u2032(s)ds, G\u221e = G0 + \u222b \u221e 0 G\u2032(s)ds.\nWe can rewrite (83) as T\u0302(E(t), Etr) = G\u221eE(t) + \u222b \u221e\n0 G\u2032(s)Etr(s)ds, (84)\nwhere Etr(s) = E t(s)\u2212 E(t). Since Etr corresponds to \u039btr in (24) if \u039b = E, then G corresponds to IL0 in (46) with \u03a3e(t) = G\u221eE(t). Accordingly, G\u221e corresponds to ILe. The consequence of the second law stated by (56) takes the form\nG\u2032s(\u03c9) = \u222b \u221e\n0 G\u2032(s) sin \u03c9s ds < 0 \u2200 \u03c9 \u2208 R++, (85)\nin the present context. Moreover, from thermodynamic arguments [14], it follows that\nG\u221e = G>\u221e, G0 = G>0 , G0 \u2212G\u221e > 0.\nAccording to Properties 1\u20133 and (4), a functional \u03c8\u0302(E(t), Etr) is said to be a free energy for the (possibly nonlinear) stress functional T\u0302(E(t), Etr) if it fulfills:\n\u2202 \u2202E(t) \u03c8\u0302 ( E(t), Etr ) \u2212 DE \u03c8\u0302(E(t), Etr) = T\u0302(E(t), Etr)\n\u03c8\u0302(E(t), Etr) \u2265 \u03c6\u0303(E(t)) and \u03c6\u0303(0) = 0 \u03c8\u0307(t) \u2264 W\u0307(t) = T(t) \u00b7 E\u0307(t), \u03c8(t) = \u03c8\u0302(E(t), Etr), T(t) = T\u0302(E(t), Etr)\n(86)\nfor all E(t), Etr. The term DE \u03c8\u0302 is related to the Fr\u00e9ch\u00e9t differential \u03b4\u03c8\u0302 through the representation formula (see (26))\nDE \u03c8\u0302 ( E(t), Etr ) \u00b7 E(t) = \u03b4\u03c8\u0302 ( E(t), Etr \u2223\u2223E\u2020). The free energy (39) becomes\n\u03c8(t) := \u03c8\u0302(E(t), Etr) = \u03c6\u0303 ( E(t) ) +\n1 2 \u222b \u221e 0 \u222b \u221e 0 Etr(s1) \u00b7 IK(s1, s2)Etr(s2)ds1ds2, (87)\nwhere IK(s1, s2) = IL12(s1, s2). Moreover, (11) takes the form\n\u03c8\u0307(t) +D(t) = T(t) \u00b7 E\u0307(t) (88)\nwhere D(t) \u2265 0 is the rate of dissipation, which is given in general by (53) and here by\nD(t) = 1 2 \u222b \u221e 0 \u222b \u221e 0 E\u0307t(s1) \u00b7 ID(s1, s2)E\u0307t(s2) ds1 ds2, ID(s1, s2) = \u2212 \u2202\n\u2202s1 IL(s1, s2)\u2212\n\u2202\n\u2202s2 IL(s1, s2).\nSince Bearing in mind that\nE\u0307t(s) = \u2212 d ds Et(s) = \u2212 d ds Etr(s)\na double integration by parts, with respect to s1 and s2, yields\nD(t) = 1 2 \u222b \u221e 0 \u222b \u221e 0 Etr(s1) \u00b7 ID12(s1, s2)Etr(s2) ds1 ds2, ID12(s1, s2) = \u2202\n\u2202s1 \u2202 \u2202s2 ID(s1, s2).\nWe have the correspondences between G and IL0 and between G\u221e and ILe noted after (84). In addition, the work function (82) becomes\n\u03c8\u0302M(E(t), Etr) = 1 2 E(t) \u00b7G\u221eE(t) + 1 2 \u222b \u221e 0 \u222b \u221e 0 Etr(s1) \u00b7G12(|s1 \u2212 s2|)Etr(s1)ds1ds2.\nSince \u03c8\u0307M(t) = T(t) \u00b7 E\u0307(t), it follows from (88) that DM(t) = 0. Graffi\u2019s free energy takes the form\n\u03c8\u0302G(E(t), Etr) = 1 2 E(t) \u00b7G\u221eE(t)\u2212 1 2 \u222b \u221e 0 Etr(s) \u00b7G\u2032(s)Etr(s)ds. (89)\nIn addition,\nDG(t) = 1 2 \u222b \u221e 0 Etr(s) \u00b7G\u2032\u2032(s)Etr(s) ds.\nFor the functional specified by (89) to be a free energy, it is required that (see (78))\nG\u2032(s) < 0, G\u2032\u2032(s) \u2265 0. (90)\n5.1. Nonlinear Constitutive Equations Special cases of Proposition 1 are now considered in the context of viscoelasticity. Let T\u0302` be the given linear constitutive functional (84) and \u03c8\u0302` any related free energy functional with kernel G. Let f : R+ \u2192 R+ be any given smooth function such that\nf (0) = 0, f \u2032 > 0, f \u2032(0) = 1. (91)\nThen, nonlinear stress\u2013strain constitutive equations can be obtained by considering the memory relation\nT(t) = f \u2032 ( \u03c8`(t) ) T\u0302`(E(t), Etr) (92)\nand the corresponding nonlinear free energy is\n\u03c8(t) = f ( \u03c8\u0302`(E(t), Etr) ) . (93)\nIndeed, we have \u03c8(t) \u2265 0 and\nT(t) \u00b7 E\u0307(t) = f \u2032 ( \u03c8`(t) ) T`(t) \u00b7 E\u0307(t) \u2265 f \u2032 ( \u03c8`(t) ) \u03c8\u0307`(t) = \u03c8\u0307(t).\nFor example, we can choose f (x) = x + x2, f (x) = ex \u2212 1 and f (x) = log(x + 1). When f (x) = x + x2, then (92) and (93) yield\nT(t) = ( 1 + 2\u03c8`(t) ) T`(t),\n\u03c8(t) = \u03c8`(t) ( 1 + \u03c8`(t) ) ,\nD(t) = D`(t) ( 1 + 2\u03c8`(t) ) .\n(94)\nIn fact, we should replace 1 in the relation for \u03c8(t) by a constant with the dimensions of free energy so as to maintain explicitly correct dimensionality in each expression. What we are doing here is choosing units such that this constant has a value of 1. More generally, let us consider memory kernels Gi, i = 1, 2, . . . n, satisfying (85) and lims\u2192\u221e Gi(s) = Gi\u221e. Let\nT i(t) = Gi\u221eE(t) + \u222b \u221e\n0 G\u2032i(s)E t r(s)ds,\ndenote the related i-th linear model and let \u03c8i(t) be any associated free energy satisfying (86). Thus, we have\n\u03c8i(t) \u2265 0 and \u03c8\u0307i(t) \u2264 T i(t) \u00b7 E\u0307(t). In particular, for any given pair of kernels Gi and Gj, we can construct a nonlinear\nstress\u2013strain functional of the form\nT(t) = T i(t) + 2\u03c8j(t)T j(t). (95)\nwhich admits the following free energy functional\n\u03c8(t) = \u03c8i(t) + ( \u03c8j(t) )2. (96) In addition, given a nonlinear function g obeying the relations specified in (91), we\ncan generalize (95) and (96) as follows:\nT(t) = T i(t) + g\u2032 ( \u03c8j(t) ) T j(t), \u03c8(t) = \u03c8i(t) + g ( \u03c8j(t) ) .\nfor any fixed pair of integers i, j. By virtue of (88), we have\n\u03c8\u0307(t) = T(t) \u00b7 E\u0307(t)\u2212D(t), D(t) = Di(t) + g\u2032 ( \u03c8j(t) ) Dj(t) \u2265 0. (97)\n5.2. A Nonlinear Viscoelastic Model Based on Graffi\u2019s Free Energy\nLetting \u03c8` = \u03c8\u0302G and T` = T\u0302, as given by (89) and (84), respectively, we obtain from (94) a nonlinear constitutive equation of the following form\nT(t) = G\u221eE(t) + \u222b \u221e\n0 G\u2032(s)Etr(s)ds + [G\u221eE(t)\u2297G\u221eE(t)]E(t)\n+ E(t) \u00b7G\u221eE(t) \u222b \u221e\n0 G\u2032(s)Etr(s)ds\u2212 \u222b \u221e 0 Etr(s) \u00b7G\u2032(s)Etr(s)dsG\u221eE(t)\n\u2212 \u222b \u221e\n0 \u222b \u221e 0 [ G\u2032(u)Etr(u)\u2297G\u2032(s)Etr(s) ] Etr(s)dsdu\nand a related free energy given by\n\u03c8(t) = 1 2 E(t) \u00b7G\u221eE(t)\u2212 1 2 \u222b \u221e 0 Etr(s) \u00b7G\u2032(s)Etr(s)ds\n+ 1 4\n( E(t) \u00b7G\u221eE(t)\u2212 \u222b \u221e 0 Etr(s) \u00b7G\u2032(s)Etr(s)ds )2 .\nMoreover, the corresponding rate of dissipation is\nD(t) = 1 2 \u222b \u221e 0 Etr(s) \u00b7G\u2032\u2032(s)Etr(s) ds [ 1 + E(t) \u00b7G\u221eE(t)\u2212 \u222b \u221e 0 Etr(s) \u00b7G\u2032(s)Etr(s)ds ] ,\nFor isotropic viscoelastic materials, the kernel G\u2032 and the relaxation modulus G\u221e take the special form\nG\u2032(s) = \u03bb\u2032(s)1\u2297 1 + 2\u00b5\u2032(s)I, G\u221e = \u03bb\u221e1\u2297 1 + 2\u00b5\u221eI,\nwhere 1 is the unit second-order tensor and I the unit fourth-order tensor. Here \u03bb\u2032, \u00b5\u2032 \u2208 C1 \u2229 L1(R+;R), so that\n\u03bb(s) = \u03bb0 + \u222b t\n0 \u03bb\u2032(s) ds, \u00b5(s) = \u00b50 + \u222b t 0 \u00b5\u2032(s) ds,\nand \u03bb\u221e = lims\u2192\u221e \u03bb(s), \u00b5\u221e = lims\u2192\u221e \u00b5(s). Moreover, \u03bb\u2032, \u00b5\u2032 < 0 and \u03bb\u2032\u2032, \u00b5\u2032\u2032 \u2265 0, which are the conditions (90). Using the decomposition,\nE = 1 3 (tr E)1 + E\u25e6, T = 1 3 (tr T)1 + T\u25e6\nwhere tr stands for the trace and the subscript \u25e6 denotes the deviatoric part of the tensor, we rewrite the nonlinear stress\u2013strain relation in the form\nT\u25e6(t) = 2\u00b5\u221eE\u25e6(t)[1 + 2\u00b5\u221e|E\u25e6(t)|2] + 2[1 + 2\u00b5\u221e|E\u25e6(t)|2 \u222b \u221e\n0 \u00b5\u2032(s)Et\u25e6r(s)ds\n\u2212 4\u00b5\u221eE\u25e6(t) \u222b \u221e\n0 \u00b5\u2032(s)|Et\u25e6r(s)|2ds\u2212 4 \u222b \u221e 0 \u00b5\u2032(u)Et\u25e6r(u)du \u222b \u221e 0 \u00b5\u2032(s)|Et\u25e6r(s)|2ds,\ntr T(t) = K\u221etr E(t)[1 + K\u221e|tr E(t)|2] + [1 + K\u221e|tr E(t)|2 \u222b \u221e\n0 K\u2032(s)tr Etr(s)ds\n\u2212 K\u221etr E(t) \u222b \u221e\n0 K\u2032(s)|tr Etr(s)|2ds\u2212 \u222b \u221e 0 K\u2032(u)tr Etr(u)du \u222b \u221e 0 K\u2032(s)|tr Etr(s)|2ds,\nwhere K(s) = \u03bb(s) + 23 \u00b5(s) and K\u221e = \u03bb\u221e + 2 3 \u00b5\u221e denote the bulk elastic kernel and the bulk relaxation modulus, respectively.

A One-Dimensional Example Consider one-dimensional models associated with strain and applied traction in the direction e so that E = Ee\u2297 e, T = Te\u2297 e.\nThe symbol T for the component of T is consistent with the engineering stress considered in the literature as the ratio of the axial force over the reference area. Moreover, for simplicity, let\nG\u2032(s) = \u2212\u03b1(G0 \u2212 G\u221e) exp[\u2212\u03b1s]I, G0 = G0I, G\u221e = G\u221eI,\nwhere \u03b1, G0, G\u221e > 0 and G0 > G\u221e. Letting T` = T\u0302 , after differentiating equation (84) with respect to time, we obtain\nT\u0307`(t) = G0E\u0307(t)\u2212 \u03b1[T`(t)\u2212 G\u221eE(t)], (98)\nwhich represents the well-known equation for a standard linear solid (or Zener model). The corresponding Graffi\u2019s free energy \u03c8` = \u03c8\u0302G satisfies a similar differential equation,\n\u03c8\u0307`(t) = T`(t)E\u0307(t)\u2212 \u03b1 [ \u03c8`(t)\u2212 12 G\u221eE2(t) ] . (99)\nThe parameter \u03b1 represents the reciprocal of the characteristic relaxation time of the material. Equations (98) and (99) are not invariant under the time transformation\nt \u2192 ct, c > 0,\nand hence, they describe a rate-dependent material behavior. In particular, they predict different linear elastic behavior as c \u2192 0 (very fast processes) and c \u2192 +\u221e (very slow processes); since \u03b1\u2192 \u03b1/c we have (up to additive constants)\nT`(t)\u2192 G\u221eE(t), \u03c8`(t)\u2192 1 2 G\u221eE2(t) as c\u2192 0,\nT`(t)\u2192 G0E(t), \u03c8`(t)\u2192 1 2 G0E2(t) as c\u2192 +\u221e.\nAccordingly, from (94), it follows\nT(t)\u2192 [ 1 + G\u221eE2(t) ] G\u221eE(t) as c\u2192 0\nT(t)\u2192 [ 1 + G0E2(t) ] G0E(t), as c\u2192 +\u221e,\nThe asymptotic traction responses for T and T` is plotted in Figure 1 for both limit cases."

The constant history equal to E(t) is given by\nE\u2020(s) = E(t) , s \u2265 0 .\nAn electric conductor is hereditary if the current vector J depends on the electric field history:\nJ(t) = J\u0303(Et).\nAs previously, the dependence of J and E on the space variable x is understood and not written.\nWe start from a basic, linear constitutive equation for the current\nJ\u0303(Et) = \u222b \u221e\n0 \u03c3(s)Et(s)ds (100)\nwhere the memory kernel \u03c3 : R+ \u2192 Sym+(R3) is a summable, continuous and positivedefinite tensor-valued function. Let \u03c30 = \u222b \u221e 0 \u03c3(s)ds \u2208 Sym+. At any constant history E\u2020, we have J\u0303(E\u2020) = \u03c30 E(t).\nThis relation resembles Ohm\u2019s law and \u03c30 is referred to as the relaxation conductivity tensor. Note that the common form of Ohm\u2019s law, J(t) = \u03c30 E(t), is actually recovered if in (100) we (formally) choose the kernel \u03c3 equal to \u03c30 times the Dirac mass at zero, \u03b40. If we introduce the magnetic vector potential A and assume the vanishing of the electric scalar potential (as usual in electric conductors), we obtain\nE(t) = \u2212A\u0307(t), A(s)\u2212A(t) = \u222b t\ns E(u) du,\nso that the relative past history of A, given by (24), equals the relative summed past history of the electric field in the notation (32), since\nAtr(s) = A(t\u2212 s)\u2212A(t) = \u222b t\nt\u2212s E(u) du = \u222b s 0 Et(\u03c4) d\u03c4. (101)\nThus,\n\u2202\n\u2202s Atr(s) = E\nt(s), \u2202\n\u2202t Atr(s) = A\u0307(t\u2212 s)\u2212 A\u0307(t) = E(t)\u2212 E(t\u2212 s) = \u2212Etr(s) (102)\nand after an integration by parts, we can rewrite (100) in the form\nJ\u0302(Atr) = \u222b \u221e\n0 \u03ba(s)Atr(s)ds, (103)\nwhere \u03ba = \u2212\u03c3\u2032. The history Atr, given by (101), corresponds to \u039btr in (24) if \u039b = A. In addition, we see that \u03ba corresponds to IL\u20320 in (46) with \u03a3e = 0. Alternatively, taking \u039b = E and \u039b\u0302 = \u2212A, then Atr corresponds to \u039b\u0302 t r; given by (32) and from (31), it follows that\nW(t) = \u222b t \u2212\u221e J\u0303(E\u03c4) \u00b7 E(\u03c4)d\u03c4 = \u2212 \u222b t \u2212\u221e J\u0302(A\u03c4r ) \u00b7 A\u0307(\u03c4)d\u03c4.\nCondition (56), which is a consequence of the second law, takes the form [43]\n\u03bas(\u03c9) = \u222b \u221e\n0 \u03ba(s) sin \u03c9s ds > 0 \u2200 \u03c9 \u2208 R++, (104)\nin the present context. It is satisfied if \u03ba is positive-definite. A functional \u03c8\u0302 of the relative past history of the magnetic vector potential, Atr, is said to be a free energy for the (possibly nonlinear) current functional J\u0302(Atr), if it fulfills Properties 1\u20133 and (4), as adapted as in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. We write these as follows:\nDA \u03c8\u0302(A t r) = \u2212J\u0302(Atr) \u03c8\u0302(Atr) \u2265 0 \u2200Atr and \u03c8\u0302(0\u2020) = 0 \u03c8\u0307(t) \u2264 J(t) \u00b7 E(t) = \u2212J(t) \u00b7 A\u0307(t),\n(105)\nwhere \u03c8(t) = \u03c8\u0302(Atr), J(t) = J\u0302(A t r). Note that we omit any dependence of \u03c8\u0302 on A(t) as in (35). The term DA \u03c8\u0302(Atr) is related to the Fr\u00e9ch\u00e9t differential \u03b4\u03c8\u0302(A t r| \u00b7) through the representation formula (see (26))\nDA \u03c8\u0302(A t r) \u00b7A(t) = \u03b4\u03c8\u0303(Atr|A\u2020)\nfor any choice of A(t). In the context of quadratic free energies, the operation DA is simply differentiation with respect to the explicit occurrence of A(t) in Atr as given in (101).\nFirstly, the general form of the free energy (39) reduces to\n\u03c8(t) = \u03c8\u0302(Atr) = 1 2 \u222b \u221e 0 \u222b \u221e 0 Atr(s1) \u00b7 IK(s1, s2)Atr(s2) ds1 ds2\n= 1 2 \u222b \u221e 0 \u222b \u221e 0 Et(s1) \u00b7 IL(s1, s2)Et(s2) ds1 ds2, (106)\nwhere IK(s1, s2) = IL12(s1, s2). Moreover, we can write (105)4 in the form:\n\u03c8\u0307(t) +D(t) = J(t) \u00b7 E(t),\nwhere D(t) \u2265 0 is the rate of dissipation, which is given in general by (53) and here by\nD(t) =1 2 \u222b \u221e 0 \u222b \u221e 0 Et(s1) \u00b7 ID(s1, s2)Et(s2) ds1 ds2,\nID(s1, s2) =\u2212 \u2202\n\u2202s1 IL(s1, s2)\u2212\n\u2202\n\u2202s2 IL(s1, s2).\nLetting IK0 = \u03ba subject to (104), the work function (82) becomes\n\u03c8M(t) = \u03c8\u0302M(Atr) = 1 2 \u222b \u221e 0 \u222b \u221e 0 Atr(s1) \u00b7 \u03ba(|s1 \u2212 s2|)Atr(s2) ds1 ds2.\nThere are many choices of free energy that can be used in this context. For example, there is the explicit form for the minimum free energy relating to continuous spectrum materials, which is derived in [24]. Minimal states are singletons for such materials. However, we will opt for algebraic simplicity by choosing the Graffi free energy (77). This takes the form\n\u03c8G(t) = \u03c8\u0303G(Atr) = 1 2 \u222b \u221e 0 Atr(s) \u00b7 \u03ba(s)Atr(s)ds.\nFor this functional to be a free energy, it is required that\n\u03ba(s) > 0, \u03ba\u2032(s) \u2264 0.\n6.1. Nonlinear Electric Conductors We now consider special cases of Proposition 1 in the context of electrical conductors with memory. Let J\u0302\u03ba be a given linear constitutive functional (103) and \u03c8\u0303\u03ba any related Graffi free energy functional with kernel \u03ba. Various forms of nonlinear constitutive equation can be obtained by taking the nonlinear current to be\nJ(t) = f \u2032 ( \u03c8\u03ba(t) ) J\u03ba(t), (107)\nwhere f satisfies (91). Due to the condition f \u2032(0) = 1, the linear constitutive equation for J\u03ba gives the first-order approximation to (107). The expression for the corresponding nonlinear free energy is\n\u03c8(t) = f ( \u03c8\u03ba(t) ) .\nIndeed, we have \u03c8(t) \u2265 0 and\nJ(t) \u00b7 E(t) = f \u2032 ( \u03c8\u03ba(t) ) Jk(t) \u00b7 E(t) \u2265 f \u2032 ( \u03c8\u03ba(t) ) \u03c8\u0307k(t) = \u03c8\u0307(t).\nMore generally, let J\u0302i denote the linear models\nJi(t) = J\u0302i(Atr) := \u222b \u221e\n0 \u03bai(s)Atr(s)ds, i = 1, ..., n,\nwhose kernels \u03bai are compatible with thermodynamics in the sense that they obey (104), and let \u03c8i(t) be any free energy associated with the i-th model satisfying (105). Thus, we have\n\u03c8i(t) \u2265 0 and \u03c8\u0307i(t) \u2264 Ji(t) \u00b7 E(t). For any given pair of kernels \u03bai and \u03baj, we can construct a nonlinear current functional\nand a free energy functional of the form\nJ(t) = Ji(t) + \u03b1\u03c8\u03b1\u22121j (t)Jj(t), \u03c8(t) = \u03c8i(t) + ( \u03c8j(t) )\u03b1, \u03b1 > 1. 6.2. Integral Representations of the Current\nThe goal of this subsection is to establish a connection between the nonlinear constitutive functionals proposed in Section 6.1 and constitutive functionals in the form of single, double and triple integrals of the kind proposed by Graffi in [44,45] (see also [7]). Following the suggestions of Graffi\u2019s paper, we assume a nonlinear constitutive equation of the following general form\nJ(t) = \u222b \u221e\n0 S(s)Et(s)ds + \u222b \u221e 0 \u222b \u221e 0 S(s1, s2)Et(s1)\u2297 Et(s2) ds1 ds2\n+ \u222b \u221e\n0 \u222b \u221e 0 \u222b \u221e 0 S (s1, s2, s3)Et(s1)\u2297 Et(s2)\u2297 Et(s3) ds1 ds2 ds3,\nwhere S, S and S are a second, third and fourth-order tensor-valued function, respectively. A somewhat similar expansion was used in (59). For arbitrary vectors A, B, C \u2208 V , we have(\nSA ) i = \u03c3ij Aj , ( SA\u2297 B ) i = S ijk AjBk , ( S A\u2297 B\u2297 C ) i = Sijkl AjBkCl .\nThe quantities S and S can be taken to be invariant under any permutation of the arguments provided the same permutation is applied to the subscripts jk and jkl. For simplicity, let us assume that the constitutive relation for J is isotropic. It follows that S vanishes, and S, S must be isotropic tensors. Thus,\n\u03c3ij = \u03c3 \u03b4ij , Sijkl = S1 \u03b4ij\u03b4kl + S2 \u03b4ik\u03b4jl + S3 \u03b4il\u03b4jk,\nwhere \u03c3, S1, S2, S3 are scalar functions of the elapsed time s. This implies S A = \u03c3A and\nS A\u2297 B\u2297 C = S1 (B \u00b7 C)A + S2 (A \u00b7 C)B + S3 (A \u00b7 B)C,\nso that\nJ(t) = \u222b \u221e\n0 \u03c3(s)Et(s)ds\n+ \u222b \u221e\n0 \u222b \u221e 0 \u222b \u221e 0 S1(s1, s2, s3) [ Et(s2) \u00b7 Et(s3) ] Et(s1) ds1 ds2 ds3\n+ \u222b \u221e\n0 \u222b \u221e 0 \u222b \u221e 0 S2(s1, s2, s3) [ Et(s3) \u00b7 Et(s1) ] Et(s2) ds1 ds2 ds3\n+ \u222b \u221e\n0 \u222b \u221e 0 \u222b \u221e 0 S3(s1, s2, s3) [ Et(s1) \u00b7 Et(s2) ] Et(s3) ds1 ds2 ds3 .\n(108)\nThe symmetry properties of S gives relations between S1, S2, and S3:\nS1(s1, s2, s3) = S1(s1, s3, s2) S2(s1, s2, s3) = S2(s3, s2, s1) S3(s1, s2, s3) = S3(s2, s1, s3)\n(109)\nwhich are apparent in any case from (108) and\nS2(s1, s2, s3) = S1(s2, s1, s3) S3(s1, s2, s3) = S1(s3, s2, s1)\namong other similar relations. We finally obtain\nJ(t) = \u222b \u221e\n0 \u03c3(s)Et(s)ds\n+ \u222b \u221e\n0 \u222b \u221e 0 \u222b \u221e 0 S(s1, s2, s3) [ Et(s2) \u00b7 Et(s3) ] Et(s1) ds1 ds2 ds3,\n(110)\nwhere S(s1, s2, s3) = 3S1(s1, s2, s3).\nBecause of the first equality in (109) we have S(s1, s2, s3) = S(s1, s3, s2). Hence, assuming the factorization\nS(s1, s2, s3) = \u03bb(s1)L(s2, s3),\nit follows that L(s2, s3) = L(s3, s2). Letting ILij = L\u03b4ij in (106) we obtain\n\u03c8L(t) = 1 2 \u222b \u221e 0 \u222b \u221e 0 L(s1, s2)Et(s1) \u00b7 Et(s2) ds1 ds2,\nand (110) becomes J(t) = J\u03c3(t) + 2\u03c8L(t)J\u03bb(t),\nwhere J\u03c3(t) = \u222b \u221e 0 \u03c3(s)Et(s)ds, J\u03bb(t) = \u222b \u221e 0 \u03bb(s)Et(s)ds.\nFinally, letting \u03bb(s) = L(0, s), we obtain the corresponding free energy \u03c8(t) = \u03c8\u03c3(t) + ( \u03c8L(t) )2. It is worth noting that this choice of \u03c8 is not unique, but it is the simplest one. Indeed,\nin general for any pair L1, L2 such that L1(0, s) = L2(0, s) = \u03bb(s), we have\n\u03c8(t) = \u03c8\u03c3(t) + \u03c8L1(t)\u03c8L2(t) .\nFor the static history E\u2020(s) = E(t), s \u2208 R+, we have\n\u03c8L(t) = 1 2 ` |E(t)|2, ` = \u222b \u221e 0 \u222b \u221e 0 L(s1, s2) ds1 ds2 > 0,\nJ(t) = \u03c30E(t) + \u03bb0 ` |E(t)|2 E(t).\nwhere \u03bb0 and \u03c30 are defined by\n\u03bb0 = \u222b \u221e\n0 \u03bb(s)ds, \u03c30 = \u222b \u221e 0 \u03c3(s)ds.\nIn particular, by applying the Graffi free energy functional, \u03c8L = \u03c8G\u03bb , we have\n` = 2 \u222b \u221e\n0 s\u03bb(s)ds.\nIf we restrict our attention to the one-dimensional case, the nonlinear current response J(t) to the application of the static E(t)-valued history is plotted in Figure 2."

            "text": "The vector spaceV is now taken to beR3. In addition, kernels take values in Lin(V) = Lin(R3), which is the space of second-order tensors. In this section, we consider some nonlinear evolution problems arising from the coupling of hereditary models for the electric current with Maxwell equations. This kind of problem describes electromagnetic phenomena in the ionosphere and, more generally, in a nonlinear model of plasma (see [36,46,47], for instance). The corresponding linear model has been scrutinized in [48,49] and extended to explain electromagnetic behavior in a conducting (or imperfect) dielectric such as water (see [36,43,50], for example).\n7.1. An Energy Inequality for a Nonlinear Plasma Let B \u2282 R3 be a bounded region occupied by a plasma. According to the Minkowski approach, Maxwell\u2019s equations take the same form in the whole spaceR3, namely \u2202tB+\u2207\u00d7 E = 0, \u2202tD\u2212\u2207\u00d7H+ J = 0, \u2207 \u00b7B = 0 \u2207 \u00b7D = 0. (111)\nHereafter, \u2207 := \u2202x denotes the gradient. Let H denote the magnetic field. The magnetic induction B and displacement vector D are given by B = \u00b5H, D = \u03b5E in B, (112)\nwhere \u03b5 and \u00b5 are positive constants which stand for the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of the material, respectively. As usual,\n\u03b5 = \u03b50(1 + \u03c7e)\nwhere \u03b50 is the vacuum permittivity and \u03c7e is the electric susceptibility of the material. Thus, we can write D = \u03b50E+P by introducing the polarization P = \u03b50\u03c7eE. Similarly,\n\u00b5 = \u00b50(1 + \u03c7m),\nwhere \u00b50 is the vacuum permeability and 1 + \u03c7m is the relative permeability of the material so that, after introducing the magnetization M = \u03c7mH, we can write B = \u00b50(H+M). We assume that the constitutive equation of the electric current J of the plasma is given by\nJ(t) = J\u0303(Et),\nwhere J\u0303 is a (linear or nonlinear) functional of the electric field history. Let \u03c8 be a free energy functional satisfying (105). We first establish a local energy inequality for the plasma evolution system. Multiplying the first equation of the system (111) by H and the second by E, we obtain by virtue of (112) the local energy balance\n1 2 d dt\n( \u03b5|E|2 + \u00b5|H|2 ) +\u2207 \u00b7 ( E\u00d7H ) + J \u00b7 E = 0.\nFrom the last inequality in (105) it follows that\n1 2 d dt\n( \u03b5|E|2 + \u00b5|H|2 + 2\u03c8 ) +\u2207 \u00b7 ( E\u00d7H ) \u2264 0. (113)\nAccording to [51], we assume the natural boundary conditions at a free plasma surface,\nE\u00d7 n = 0, H \u00b7 n = J \u00b7 n = 0 on \u2202B. (114)\nInitial conditions, including the past history of the electric field E0, must also be assigned;\nE(0) = E0, H(0) = H0, E0(s) = E\u0302 0 (s), s > 0. (115)\nNow, integrating (113) over B, it follows\n1 2 d dt\n( \u03b5\u2016E\u20162 + \u00b5\u2016H\u20162 + \u03a8 ) \u2264 0, \u03a8 = 2 \u222b B \u03c8 dx,\n\u2016 \u00b7 \u2016 being the norm in L2(B). This is due to the well-known property of the Poynting vector,\u222b B \u2207 \u00b7 ( E\u00d7H ) dx = \u222b \u2202B (E\u00d7H ) \u00b7 n da = \u2212 \u222b \u2202B (E\u00d7 n ) \u00b7H da,\nalong with the first boundary condition in (114). Accordingly, the L2 norms of E(t), H(t) and the function \u03a8(t) = \u03a8\u0302(Et) are bounded for all t by their initial values,\n\u03b5\u2016E(t)\u20162 + \u00b5\u2016H(t)\u20162 + \u03a8\u0302(Et) \u2264 \u03b5\u2016E0\u20162 + \u00b5\u2016H0\u20162 + \u03a8\u0302(E\u03020). (116)\n7.2. Boundedness of the Electric Current By exploiting this energy estimate, we establish here some results about the boundedness of the electric current functional. It is noteworthy that linear and nonlinear models yield different consequences on the L2 norm of the electric current.\nLet J\u0302 be a linear isotropic functional, which is given by\nJ\u0302(Atr) = \u222b \u221e\n0 \u03ba(s)Atr(s)ds = \u222b \u221e 0 \u03c3(s)Et(s)ds, \u03ba = \u2212\u03c3\u2032,\nand \u03c8 is a related quadratic free energy, so that its integral over B is equivalent to a weighted L2-norm. For instance, when \u03ba > 0, \u03ba\u2032 < 0 and the Graffi functional \u03c8G is the chosen free energy, then\n\u03a8(t) = 2 \u222b B \u03c8G(t) dx = \u222b \u221e 0 \u03ba(s)\u2016Atr(s)\u20162ds = \u2016Atr\u20162H\u03ba ,\nwhere H\u03ba denotes the weighted Hilbert space L2\u03ba(R+; L2(B)). Moreover, letting \u03ba0 = \u222b \u221e 0 \u03ba(s)ds, we have\n|J\u0302(Atr)| \u2264 \u222b \u221e\n0 \u03ba1/2(s)\u03ba1/2(s)|Atr(s)|ds \u2264 \u03ba1/20 [\u222b \u221e 0 \u03ba(s)|Atr(s)|2ds ]1/2\nand then, the L2 norm of the electric current is bounded for all t > 0 as well as \u03a8,\n\u2016J(t)\u20162 \u2264 \u03ba0\u2016Atr\u20162H\u03ba = \u03ba0\u03a8(t).\nOn the other hand, let J\u0302 be a nonlinear functional, for instance\nJ\u0302(Atr) = [ 1 + \u03b1\u03c8\u03b1\u22121G (A t r) ] \u222b \u221e\n0 \u03ba(s)Atr(s)ds, \u03b1 > 1/2. (117)\nWe are forced to restrict our analysis to \u03b1 > 1/2 to prevent the electric current J(t) from assuming singular or non-zero constant values when the null constant history of the electric field Et = 0\u2020 is considered. Accordingly,\n\u03a8(t) = 2 \u222b B ( \u03c8G(t) + [\u03c8G(t)]\u03b1 ) dx\n= \u2016Atr\u20162H\u03ba + 1\n2\u03b1\u22121 \u222b B [\u222b \u221e 0 \u03ba(s)|Atr(s)|2ds ]\u03b1 dx (118)\nMoreover, applying H\u00f6lder\u2019s inequality\n|J\u0302(Atr)| \u2264 [ 1 + \u03b1 (\n1 2 \u222b \u221e 0 \u03ba(s)|Atr(s)|2ds )\u03b1\u22121] \u03ba1/20 [\u222b \u221e 0 \u03ba(s)|Atr(s)|2ds ]1/2\n\u2264 \u03ba1/20 [(\u222b \u221e 0 \u03ba(s)|Atr(s)|2ds )1/2 + \u03b1 2\u03b1\u22121 (\u222b \u221e 0 \u03ba(s)|Atr(s)|2ds )\u03b1\u22121/2] ,\nand then, we have the following estimate of the L2 norm of the electric current,\n\u2016J\u0302(Atr)\u20162 \u2264 2\u03ba0 [ \u2016Atr\u20162H\u03ba + \u03b12\n4\u03b1\u22121 \u222b B [\u222b \u221e 0 \u03ba(s)|Atr(s)|2ds ]2\u03b1\u22121 dx ] . (119)\nThis allows us to establish the following result.\nTheorem 1. Let (112) and (117) be constitutive relations for B,D and J. In addition, let the initial data be such that \u2016E0\u2016, \u2016H0\u2016 and \u03a8(0) = \u03a8\u0302(E\u03020) are bounded. Furthermore, we assume that Maxwell\u2019s equations (111) with boundary condition (114) admit solutions. Then, for all t > 0, (i) \u2016E(t)\u2016, \u2016H(t)\u2016 and \u03a8(t) are bounded; (ii) \u2016J(t)\u2016 is bounded provided that 1/2 < \u03b1 \u2264 1; otherwise, J(t) is bounded in the L\u03b2(B)-norm\nwith \u03b2 = \u03b1/(\u03b1\u2212 1/2).\nProof. Item (i) follows from the energy inequality (116). In order to establish item (ii), we first assume 1/2 < \u03b1 \u2264 1. By virtue of (119), there is a positive constant c\u03b1 such that\n\u2016J\u0302(Atr)\u20162 \u2264 c\u03b1\u03a8(t).\napplying first the H\u00f6lder inequality and then the generalized Young inequality to the last term of (118), we obtain\n\u2016Atr\u20162H\u03ba \u2264 \u03a8(t) \u2264 \u2016A t r\u20162H\u03ba + |B| 1\u2212\u03b1/22\u03b1\u22121\u2016Atr\u2016\u03b1H\u03ba \u2264 1 + c0(\u03b1, |B|)\u2016A t r\u20162H\u03ba ,\nwhere |B| denotes the Lebesgue measure of B and c0 stands for a positive constant dependent on \u03b1 and |B|. These estimates are similar to those obtained in the linear case. More generally, when \u03b1 > 1/2, we put\n\u03b2 = \u03b1/(\u03b1\u2212 1/2)\nand applying the Minkowski inequality |1 + f |\u03b2 \u2264 2\u03b2\u22121(1 + | f |\u03b2), \u03b2 > 1, we obtain\n|J\u0302(Atr)|\u03b2 \u2264 \u03ba\u03b2/20\n[ 1 + \u03b1 ( 1 2 \u222b \u221e 0 \u03ba(s)|Atr(s)|2ds )\u03b1\u22121]\u03b2[\u222b \u221e 0 \u03ba(s)|Atr(s)|2ds ]\u03b2/2 \u2264 2\u03b2\u22121\u03ba\u03b2/20 [(\u222b \u221e 0 \u03ba(s)|Atr(s)|2ds )\u03b2/2 + \u03b1\u03b2 2\u03b2(\u03b1\u22121) (\u222b \u221e 0 \u03ba(s)|Atr(s)|2ds )\u03b1] .\nhence, there exists some positive constant C\u03b1 such that\n\u2016J\u0302(Atr)\u2016\u03b2L\u03b2(B) \u2264 C\u03b1 [ \u2016Atr\u2016\u03b2H\u03ba + \u03a8(t) ] .\nMoreover, if \u03b1 > 1, then \u03b2 < 2 and the generalized Young inequality gives\n\u2016J\u0302(Atr)\u2016\u03b2L\u03b2(B) \u2264 C\u03b1 [ \u03b1\u2212 1 2\u03b1\u2212 1 + \u03b1 2\u03b1\u2212 1\u2016A t r\u20162H\u03ba + \u03a8(t) ] \u2264 C\u03b1 [ 1 + 2\u03a8(t) ] .\nin particular, when \u03b1 = 2, we have \u03b2 = 4/3.\nAuthor Contributions: Investigation, C.G. and J.M.G.
