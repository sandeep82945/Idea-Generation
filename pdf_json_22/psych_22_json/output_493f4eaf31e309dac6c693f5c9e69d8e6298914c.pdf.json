    "abstractText": "Purpose: The relationships among employee aging, working memory capacity, and task performance in the context of information technology were studied, and these investigations in turn provide insight into improving employee task performance and mitigating the negative effects of employee aging. Participants and Methods: Based on the limited resource theory and the inhibitory deficit theory, a total of 296 valid questionnaires were collected and the relationships among the variables were examined using cascaded linear regression via SPSS 22.0. Results: Aging negatively affects working memory capacity and task performance. Working memory capacity partially mediates the relationship between age and task performance. Time pressure can exacerbate the negative effects of age on task performance, and self-efficacy mitigates the negative effects of age on task performance. Discussion: Employee information system learning and training can be enhanced to ameliorate the negative impact of aging on task performance. IT-related work can be limited to a manageable level to reduce the negative effects of reduced working memory capacity. Employees\u2019 internal motivation can be gradually cultivated, and employees can be guided toward the improvement of their IT selfefficacy.",

Participants and Methods: Based on the limited resource theory and the inhibitory deficit theory, a total of 296 valid questionnaires were collected and the relationships among the variables were examined using cascaded linear regression via SPSS 22.0. Results: Aging negatively affects working memory capacity and task performance. Working memory capacity partially mediates the relationship between age and task performance. Time pressure can exacerbate the negative effects of age on task performance, and self-efficacy mitigates the negative effects of age on task performance. Discussion: Employee information system learning and training can be enhanced to ameliorate the negative impact of aging on task performance. IT-related work can be limited to a manageable level to reduce the negative effects of reduced working memory capacity. Employees\u2019 internal motivation can be gradually cultivated, and employees can be guided toward the improvement of their IT selfefficacy.

Young employees tend to easily adapt to this work environment, while for older employees, the situation is not so simple.5 As the workforce ages, technology has dramatically increased the number of distractions in the workplace;6 irregular phone calls, sticky notes, and traffic have evolved into constant instant messaging, email notifications, meeting and task reminders, and other interruptions. These new distractions are propagated by a plethora of constantly beeping and buzzing technological devices, to the extent that technology-induced interruptions consume more\nPsychology Research and Behavior Management 2022:15 1043\u20131054 1043 \u00a9 2022 Li et al.

Therefore, the following questions are worth considering: What are the reasons for the lower task performance of older employees in the context of information technology? How can older employees be helped to improve their task performance? What are the factors that exacerbate or moderate the negative impact of aging on task performance?\nThis study introduces age as a variable into the research model to investigate whether there are aggravating and moderating factors operative in the relationship between aging and task performance and whether working memory capacity can be used as a mediating variable between age and task performance. The significance of working memory capacity can be expressed in two ways: (1) from the perspective of employer sustainability, working memory capacity can reduce labor costs and improve the task performance of older employees; (2) from the perspective of individual employees, working memory capacity improves their performance and mitigates the negative effects of information technology change."

Thus, scholars who are concerned with aging have proposed three theories to explain the correlation between cognitive decline and aging: the processing speed theory, the inhibitory deficit theory, and the limited resource theory.11 The processing speed theory concerns the relationship between age differences and cognitive performance. Scholars have used the processing speed theory as a means of support when studying the relationship between aging and task performance, but the inhibitory deficit theory and the limited resource theory have not yet been applied to the theoretical study of the relationship between aging and task performance.12 The main focus of the inhibitory deficit and limited resource theories is on the control of attention and the allocation of attentional resources when task-irrelevant information is present.13 The inhibitory deficit theory assumes that task performance is somewhat affected when task-irrelevant information is present but does not directly examine task performance as an outcome variable.14 The limited resource theory, on the other hand, suggests that distraction is more likely to reduce working memory capacity, which in turn can cause other adverse effects.15 It is thus clear that aging can have task-related effects via other factors. Furthermore, although aging is known to have a range of negative effects on cognitive performance, the question of how to mitigate such negative effects is also a current focus of researchers interested in aging and human resources."

When the demand for working memory capacity in cognitive activities exceeds an individual\u2019s capacity limit, the processing and storage capacities will be reduced to the allowable range of working memory capacity; thus, individuals with different working memory capacities will exhibit differences in the speed and accuracy of information processing and storage.16,17\nWorking memory refers to a system responsible for the temporary storage and processing of information during complex cognitive activities. The capacity of this system is limited and can be theoretically distinguished into four major components: the phonological loop, the visual-spatial template, the central executive, and the contextual buffer.18 The storage system of working memory includes subsystems that retain verbal, spatial, and visual information.19 The storage system plays a crucial in job completion, which is why many scholars have studied working memory in conjunction with\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S359624 DovePress Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2022:151044\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\ntask performance. Although much research in this area has simply assessed the correlation between working memory and cognitive task performance, there is growing interest in understanding the processes underlying relatively complex working memory tasks.20 As humans age, the speed at which they process information and their working memory capacity decrease, both of which are important mediators of the relationship between aging and cognitive decline.21\u201323 In addition, according to the limited resource theory, which explains how finite attention resources are allocated, deeper encoding processes consume more attentional resources and performing encoding with distraction can be very difficult.12 Therefore, this theory can be applied to study the negative effects of aging; after all, older people are relatively less efficient at the encoding process and thus more easily distracted, which also reduces their working memory capacity.12 Information needs to be processed and stored in working memory; depending on how the information is perceived, eg, if a person is familiar with certain aspects of the environment (extensive experience), fewer working memory resources are needed.24,25 Thus, it is the interaction between environmental stimuli and perceptual processes that generate working memory demands and, ultimately, responses such as stress.25 However, stress selection is not a simple function of information processing, which depends on the way the information is interpreted. In the context of information processing and stress, self-efficacy can be one of the factors affecting interpretation, which determines whether the processed information is interpreted as a threat.26 In previous studies, many researchers have used working memory capacity to examine the negative effects of aging. Thus, the present study proposes to use working memory capacity as a mediating variable to measure the relationship between aging and task performance."

In studies related to information management, many scholars have explored the factors that affect task performance, but there is a lack of literature regarding the relationship between aging and task performance. Few scholars have conducted studies that focus on information processing speed as the age contact point;12 however, these scholars have developed an abstract model of age and IT-supported task performance that is independent of any specific technology or software. From a practitioner\u2019s perspective, abstract models may appear to be less realistic.28 Therefore, a scenario-specific version of the model would like be more utile, the development of which would be fruitful for further in-depth research.\nIn summary, the integration of information technology into the work environment is inevitable, and decreasing cognitive level and ability caused by aging make it difficult for older employees to adapt to this environment. Although scholars have started to focus on the relationship between age and work environment,29,30 they have only explored the negative effects of aging in a one-sided manner, thus ignoring the impact of marginal conditions, such as the factors that can mitigate or exacerbate the negative effects of aging."

This theory suggests that older adults store for more information in their working memory than do younger adults, thereby disrupting the inhibitory mechanisms consisting of access and deletion functions; thus, older adults are more susceptible to the disruptive effects of technological mediators at work, which in turn can lead to poorer performance.6 It is clear from the inhibitory deficit theory how and why age affects working memory content;21,32 employees\u2019 cognition gradually deteriorates with age, with a consequent decline in working memory and selective attention. Recent studies have shown that older adults\u2019 working memory capacity tends to be more negatively affected by the salience of sensitivities than that of younger adults due to attentional amplification of sensitivities.33 Thus, the salience of interference is one of the factors by which age may affect technical adaptation, as it relies on attentional amplification (with age) and attentional amplification\u2019s impact on resource availability, potentially leading to more adverse effects on perceived stress of mental workload and performance.6\nPsychology Research and Behavior Management 2022:15 https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S359624 DovePress 1045\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nTherefore, older employees may require more working memory resources to perform IT-based work tasks than younger employees, which may lead to greater stress and lower performance.6 Thus, the following hypothesis can be formulated.\nH1: Employee age has a negative impact on task performance in the context of information technology."

It can also be expected that the older an employee is, the lower working memory capacity related to information technology he or she possesses12,34 \u2014ie, the older an employee is, the greater the negative impact on his or her working memory capacity. In addition, based on the concept of working memory capacity, in a working environment surrounded by information technology, the greater an employee\u2019s working memory capacity, the more information he or she can store, which is more conducive to the completion of work tasks.34,35 In summary, increasing age in employees leads to gradual cognitive aging, which in turn affects working memory capacity and eventually reduces performance at work.

            "text": "Time pressure is psychological stress experienced by team members who are required to complete corresponding tasks or goals assigned by their leaders within a limited time frame.36 The relationship between time pressure and performance is usually recognized as an inverted U-shaped relationship, ie, both excessive and insufficient pressure can only lead to lower performance.37 In a work environment that is inundated with new and increasingly complex information technologies, individuals constantly need to adapt to new information and transactions. Thus, they experience time pressure because slower learning of new technologies means that they may be faced with increasingly complex information technologies.12,38 When individuals feel a sense of urgency from work pressure, they are required to devote a great deal of their limited energy to cope with this negative emotion, and their performance at work naturally decreases. Moreover, in the context of iterative information technology updates, a vicious cycle can emerge with people growing tired of processing additional information, leading to reduced employee performance. This analysis is supported by researchers,39 who have found that stress and performance on computer-based tasks may be negatively related. In addition, time pressure due to factors such as the urgency and complexity of the work can cause individuals to experience positive emotions such as concentration,40 and these positive emotions in turn require higher working memory capacity to undertake the next relevant work task.\nSelf-efficacy is the belief in one\u2019s ability to accomplish a specific task or achieve success in a given situation.41 People with high self-efficacy always believe that they can complete more complex tasks, and this trait can increase the accuracy of task completion.42 In contrast, people with low self-efficacy are more likely to imagine themselves failing and to fear the negative consequences of failure.43 It has been suggested that people with higher self-efficacy experience less stress in the context of high task demands,42 and therefore, the higher self-efficacy is, the lower the working memory capacity required. If older employees have a high sense of self-efficacy, they will be more confident and make greater efforts when engaging in IT-based work tasks, and this effort and confidence can compensate for their decreased working memory capacity.12 Therefore, the following hypotheses can be formulated.\nH3a: Time pressure moderates the relationship between working memory capacity and task performance, and when time pressure is higher, the effect of working memory capacity on task performance is stronger.\nH3b: Self-efficacy moderates the relationship between working memory capacity and task performance, and when self-efficacy is higher, the effect of working memory capacity on task performance is weaker.\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S359624 DovePress Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2022:151046\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nH3c: Time pressure positively moderates the mediating effect of age on task performance through working memory capacity.\nH3d: Self-efficacy negatively moderates the mediating effect of age on task performance through working memory capacity.\nThe theoretical framework is shown in Figure 1."

The results showed that five factors with characteristic roots greater than one were obtained by unrotated principal component factor analysis. The variance explained by the first factor was 31.99%, which was lower than the criterion of 40%, so there were no serious problems with common method bias, and a follow-up study could be conducted.\n(2) Scale reliability test: Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient was used as an indicator to test reliability. The results showed that the alpha coefficients of age, working memory capacity, time pressure, self-efficacy, and task performance were 0.816, 0.898, 0.776, 0.768, and 0.748, respectively, all of which were greater than the criterion of 0.7. Thus, the internal consistency among the data and the scale reliability were satisfactory.\n(3) Validation factor analysis: Validation factor analysis was conducted using AMOS 17.0 software to test the discriminant validity of all variables. The results are shown in Table 1. The five-factor model fit indices met the requirements and were significantly better than those of other competing models, which indicated reliable discriminant validity among all variables. It also indicated to some extent that there were no serious problems with common method bias in this study.\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S359624 DovePress Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2022:151048\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)"

Model 2 showed that age negatively affected working memory capacity (\u03b2 \u00bc 0:510, p<0.001), and Hypothesis 2a was supported. Meanwhile, Model 5 showed a significant positive effect of working memory capacity on task performance (\u03b2=0.415, p<0.001), and Hypothesis 2b was verified.\nModel 6 showed that after adding working memory capacity to Model 4, working memory capacity significantly affected task performance (\u03b2 \u00bc 0:283, p<0.001), while the effect of age on task performance was still significant but less so (\u03b2 \u00bc 0:413, p<0.001), indicating that working memory capacity partially mediated the effect between age and task performance. Furthermore, we used the SPSS-PROCESS macro program for bootstrapping analysis with 5000 resamples. The results showed that the mediating effect of age through working memory capacity on task performance was \u22120.145 with a 95% confidence interval of [\u22120.239, \u22120.065], not containing 0, indicating a significant mediating effect of working memory capacity. Hypothesis 2c was supported by the above analysis.\nAs shown in Table 2, Models 7 and 8\u2014after the inclusion of control variables, mediating variables, moderating variables, and interaction terms\u2014the interaction term of working memory capacity and time pressure had a significant positive effect on task performance (\u03b2=0.065, p<0.05), while the interaction term of working memory capacity and selfefficacy had a significant negative effect on task performance (\u03b2=\u22120.081, p<0.001). Based on the suggestion by Aiken et al, the relationship between working memory capacity and task performance was plotted in two cases: one in which the moderating variable was set at a high value (one standard deviation above the mean), as shown in Figure 2, and one in which the moderating variable was set at a low value (one standard deviation below the mean), as shown in Figure 3. As seen from the graphs, the effect curve of working memory capacity on task performance is steeper, ie, the degree of influence is greater, when high time pressure or low self-efficacy are involved, and thus H3a and H3b were validated.\nIn this study, the conditional indirect effects of the moderating variables at high and low values were obtained directly by PROCESS operations, as shown in Tables 3 and 4. As seen from Table 3, the indirect effects of age on task performance via working memory capacity varied at different high and low time pressures, but the index of the moderated mediating effect was \u22120.035 with a confidence interval of [\u22120.092, 0.024], containing 0, indicating that the moderated mediating effect did not hold.As seen in Table 4, the indirect effect of age on task performance throughworkingmemory capacity varied at different levels of self-efficacy, with a moderated mediating effect index of 0.048 and a confidence interval of [0.013, 0.082], not containing 0, indicating that the moderated mediating effect did hold. Thus, H3c was not supported, while H3d was supported."

            "text": "Based on the theory of limited resources and the theory of restraining defects, this study collected 296 effective questionnaires, and proposed and verified the theoretical model of whether employee age growth will affect task performance in the context of it.\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S359624 DovePress Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2022:151050\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nTheoretical Implications The main content of this paper focuses on three tasks: first, to empirically analyze the relationship between aging and task performance; second, to investigate the mediating role of working memory capacity between aging and task performance; and third, to discuss the moderating role of time pressure and self-efficacy in the relationship between working memory capacity and task performance. In this paper, the proposed hypotheses were investigated and tested, and the following conclusions were obtained.\nFirst, we open the \u201cblack box\u201d of the relationship between age and task performance. In an IT-focused work environment, employee aging negatively affects working memory capacity and task performance. That is, older employees have a lower working memory capacity, which lowers their task performance. These findings extend the conclusions of the study by Tams et al about the relationship between working memory capacity and age and task performance.12\nSecond, our research contributes to a more detailed understanding of the time pressure. The higher the time pressure is, the higher the moderating effect on employees\u2019 working memory capacity and task performance, meaning high work time pressure causes employees to require more working memory capacity to cope with related work tasks. Besides, the hypothesis that time pressure positively moderates the mediating effect of age on task performance through working memory capacity was not supported, suggesting that older employees do not experience a decrease in task performance as a result of greater time pressure. This result may be because this study did not segment time pressure. According to\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nexisting studies, time pressure can be divided into hindering time pressure and challenging time pressure: challenging time pressure is generally considered to be a positive factor that can stimulate employees while hindering pressure functions in the opposite way.40\nThird, Our research links self-efficacy with employees\u2019 individual characteristics, which promotes their research in the field of it and aging. Despite a growing interest in the research on self-efficacy and working memory capacity in the field of psychology, the existing literature fails to unveil the internal mechanism.12,41 To make up for the limitations of the existing research, We examined their role in the relationship between age and task performance, and our findings showed, self-efficacy moderates the relationship between working memory capacity and task performance, and when employees\u2019 self-efficacy is higher, the effect of working memory capacity on task performance is weaker, which indicates that working memory capacity is more important when self-efficacy is lower. Besides, the negative indirect effect of age on task performance is weaker when employees\u2019 self-efficacy is stronger, suggesting that increasing employees\u2019 selfefficacy can significantly mitigate the negative effects of aging on task performance.\nPractical Implications The results of this study have implications for governments and businesses with respect to their responses to the aging of the working population.\n(1) Employee information system learning and training can be enhanced to ameliorate the negative impact of aging on task performance. The findings of this study proved that employee aging in the context of information technology has a negative impact on task performance; thus, we can take advantage of the effects caused by individual differences in age. For example, since younger employees are more likely to learn how to use information technology, an approach in which the \u201cnew\u201d lead the \u201cold\u201d can be implemented, such that older employees can engage with younger employees on a one-on-one basis for the purposes of information technology education and adapting to the endless array of information technology in the modern workplace.\n(2) IT-related work can be limited to a manageable level to reduce the negative effects of reduced working memory capacity. This study demonstrated that employee aging leads to a decrease in working memory capacity and that limited working memory capacity leads to a decrease in task performance. Therefore, the intensity and completion time of ITrelated tasks should be rationalized, and managers should ensure that older employees perform less intermittent IT-related work as much as possible.\n(3) Employees\u2019 internal motivation can be gradually cultivated, and employees can be guided toward improvement of their IT self-efficacy. According to the findings of the study, employees\u2019 high self-efficacy can significantly mitigate the negative impact of aging on task performance; therefore, employees\u2019 internal drive should be gradually cultivated in the context of work. Specifically, this suggestion can be implemented in two ways. First, managers should provide employees with substantive support as much as possible, such as regular information technology lectures and training, to help them add to their reserves of relevant knowledge and improve their determination to overcome difficulties. Second, a fault-tolerance mechanism can be established to reduce the psychological burden caused by the belief that \u201cmore work will lead to more mistakes; less work will lead to make fewer mistakes,\u201d which is conducive to enhancing the courage of employees with respect to exploration and learning."

            "text": "Although this paper has reported important findings regarding the relationship between age and task performance, there are still some limitations that should be noted. First, we have discussed the relationship between age and task performance only from a linear perspective, and there is already research that shows that the relationship between age and task performance is not always linear. Therefore, adding multiple survey time points may lead to further understanding of this subject. Second, a questionnaire-based measure makes common method bias a potential concern in our study. A multi-source, multi-wave approach of data collection should be used in the future to reduce common method bias. Third, the survey respondents were only from companies with a Chinese cultural background, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. Future research may conduct cross-cultural studies to further confirm the findings in other regions and countries.\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S359624 DovePress Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2022:151052\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)"
