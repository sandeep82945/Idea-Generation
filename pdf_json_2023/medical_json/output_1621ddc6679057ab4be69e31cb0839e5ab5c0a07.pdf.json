    "abstractText": "About 5% of patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) develop RT-related side effects. To assess individual radiosensitivity, we collected peripheral blood from breast cancer patients before, during and after the RT, and \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 foci, apoptosis, chromosomal aberrations (CAs) and micronuclei (MN) were analyzed and correlated with the healthy tissue side effects assessed by the RTOG/EORTC criteria. The results showed a significantly higher level of \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 foci before the RT in radiosensitive (RS) patients in comparison to normal responding patients (NOR). Analysis of apoptosis did not reveal any correlation with side effects. CA and MN assays displayed an increase in genomic instability during and after RT and a higher frequency of MN in the lymphocytes of RS patients. We also studied time kinetics of \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 foci and apoptosis after in vitro irradiation of lymphocytes. Higher levels of primary 53BP1 and co-localizing \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 foci were detected in cells from RS patients as compared to NOR patients, while no difference in the residual foci or apoptotic response was found. The data suggested impaired DNA damage response in cells from RS patients. We suggest \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 foci and MN as potential biomarkers of individual radiosensitivity, but they need to be evaluated with a larger cohort of patients for clinics.",

Late side effects, such as hyperpigmentation, fibrosis [4] and even a higher risk of pulmonary fibrosis, can also present later after RT [5]. Thus, it is of great importance for clinics to identify these radiosensitive (RS) patients at an increased risk for side effects. For now, no effective method has been introduced to clinical practice to identify RS patients with clinically sufficient sensitivity and specificity. The most attention has been given to quantification of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) using DNA repair foci [2,3,6\u20138], which are formed by proteins, such as phosphorylated histone H2AX (\u03b3H2AX) [9] and the tumor suppressor p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) [10]. Some residual foci can remain in the cells for a relatively long time and may correlate with individual radiosensitivity [11]. Radiation-induced apoptosis was also investigated as a possible biomarker for assessing radiosensitivity in vitro prior to RT [4,12\u201316]. In particular, our previously published results demonstrated negative correlation between the accumulation of late apoptotic/necrotic (LAN) cells and\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 1122. https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines11041122 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomedicines\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 1122 2 of 18\nthe level of 53BP1 and positive correlation with individual RS [2]. Micronuclei (MN) and chromosomal aberrations (CAs) represent other markers with possible clinical usability as far as a number of studies have shown differences between RS patients and normal responders (NOR) after in vitro irradiation of their lymphocytes using the CA assay [17,18] and also cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay [19\u201321]. In the present study, we analyzed the individual radiosensitivity of two groups of BC patients with either combined CHT/RT or RT alone treatment in relation to DNA repair foci, apoptosis, CA and MN in their lymphocytes. Analysis of these two groups was performed in order to assess the effects of the CHT treatment on genomic instability and apoptosis induced by RT. We assessed DNA repair foci, apoptosis, CA and MN before, during and after the RT, with the aim to compare the level of residual DNA damage and genomic instability in the RS and NOR patients. Furthermore, we analyzed apoptosis in specific populations of blood mononuclear cells (MNCs), namely neutrophils and monocytes, which have important roles in managing inflammation and phagocytosis, as well as in lymphocytes and also hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells that serve as a basis for renewing the pool of blood cells. To further validate our data, we performed a set of in vitro experiments by analyzing the kinetics of radiation-induced \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 foci and apoptosis."

These time points were shown to be the most appropriate for analysis of kinetics of genomic instability before, during and after the RT based on our previous study [2]. The dose acquired by blood cells during irradiation is not homogenous because of blood circulation, and the time of reaching equilibrium between irradiated and nonirradiated cells is individual. Therefore, we chose to draw the blood the next morning after irradiation, when relative equilibrium in blood and plateau in kinetics of residual foci are usually observed. MNCs were isolated from fresh blood via centrifugation on a lymphocyte separation medium (LSM, Sigma Aldrich, Burlington, MA, USA) as previously\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 1122 3 of 18\ndescribed [2].

Five G2 patients exhibited severe acute side effects (erythema, skin desquamations) as assessed during the study.

Of the 57 patients, 5 were categorized as RS with grade 2 erythema and patchy desquamations (G2 acute reactions according to the RTOG/EORTC criteria). From these five RS patients, CHT treatment was applied to three RS patients prior to RT while another two RS patients were not treated with CHT.

This induced level then significantly decreased one month and one year after RT (Fisher LSD, p = 0.002 and 0.014, respectively). Although the trend to induction of \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 foci was observed by 24 h after the 4th fraction, it was statistically insignificant. The numbers of \u03b3H2AX or 53BP1 foci decreased after the completion of RT (Fisher LSD, p \u2264 0.03). In the NOR group, we obtained the same results as in the group of all patients, since 52 out of 57 patients belonged to the NOR group (Figure 1). Interestingly, in the group of RS patients, we found a significantly higher amount of 53BP1 foci before the start of RT in comparison to any other collection timepoint: 24 h after the 4th fraction, one month and one year after the RT (Fisher LSD, p = 0.05, 0.02 and 0.002, respectively). No such trend was observed in the NOR group. Individual variability did not change, both during and after the RT, as illustrated by the 95% confidence interval in Figure 1.\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 1122 6 of 18\nFurther, we then compared the effects in cells of patients treated with CHT and RT and from those patients treated with RT alone. Although in the dataset pooled from all patients, we found significant induction of \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 foci 24 h after the 4th fraction of RT, only a trend to this induction was seen in datasets from CHT + RT and RT alone patients. This difference was likely caused by higher statistical power for the dataset pooled from all patients. Next, we found a higher level of co-localizing \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 foci before the RT in the CHT + RT group as compared with the RT alone group (Fisher LSD, p = 0.04). These data suggested persistence of CHT-induced damage until the start of RT. In the group of CHT + RT patients, results also showed a significant decrease in \u03b3H2AX foci detected one year after the RT in comparison to the numbers counted before the RT (Fisher LSD, p = 0.03). There was also a trend to a decreased level of co-localizing \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 foci one month and year after RT, as compared to values observed before the start of RT (Fisher LSD, p = 0.089 and 0.057, respectively). However, no such trend was present in the RT only group, probably mirroring the CHT-induced foci that further decreased. Since there was no CHT, in the RT alone group, we did not see a decrease in foci count after the RT (Figure 2). To conclude, the data suggested persistence of CHT-induced DNA damage in the PBL until one month after the CHT treatment. We also concluded that CHT-induced DNA damage persisted in the lymphocytes of BC patients at least one month after CHT and that CHT treatment is more genotoxic to PBL in comparison to RT.

MN and Chromosomal Aberrations in PBL of BC Patients We also analyzed micronuclei and CA (dicentric and ring chromosomes) in PBL of thirteen BC patients subjected to RT (Figure S4). Six BC patients were treated with CHT prior to RT while seven patients were not. Of these 13 patients, 2 developed G2-stage adverse skin reactions after RT. Neither of these RS patients were treated with CHT. We observed a trend to higher MN frequency in RS patients before the RT, 2.2 vs. 1.4 in NOR patients. However, this trend was not statistically significant. Additionally, the frequency of total CA, rings and dicentrics was not significantly higher in the RS patients when compared to the NOR patients (Figure 5A). Based on the obtained results, we conclude that MN warrants evaluation as a potential marker of individual radiosensitivity in a larger cohort of RS patients.

Neither of these RS patients were treated with CHT. We observed a trend to higher MN frequency in RS patients before the RT, 2.2 vs. 1.4 in NOR patients. However, this trend was not statistically significant. Additionally, the frequency of total CA, rings and dicentrics was not significantly higher in the RS patients when compared to the NOR patients (Figure 5A). Based on the obtained results, we conclude that MN warrants evaluation as a potential marker of individual radiosensitivity in a larger cohort of RS patients. In line with the literature data [27,28], we found a significantly increased frequency of MN, dicentric and ring chromosomes after one week of RT (MN: p = 0.03; dicentrics: p = 0.0001; rings: p = 0.02). This increase also persisted one month after the end of RT (MN: p = 0.002; dicentrics: p = 0.00006; rings: p = 0.04) (Figure 5B). Next, we compared the level of CA/MN in cells of patients treated with CHT + RT and those treated solely with RT but did not find any significant differences between these groups of patients. However, we detected different kinetics in the accumulation of dicentrics (Figure S5). Namely, the amount of dicentrics increased significantly from a baseline of 1.9% to 4.57% after one week of RT in the RT alone patients (Fisher LSD, p = 0.001), while dicentrics increased from the baseline level of 1.83% to 2.82% in the PBL of BC patients treated with CHT + RT. Finally, at one month after the RT, we observed almost the same level of dicentrics in CHT + RT and RT alone patients, 4.3% and 4.5%, respectively, very similar to the results of Moquet et al., who observed about 5% of dicentrics in the BC patients before the last fraction of RT [28], suggesting the persistence of RT-induced dicentric chromosomes up to one month after the completion of RT.

As far as no difference was observed between \u03b3H2AX foci at this time point (Figure 7A\u2013C) and because the accumulation of 53BP1 at the location of DSB follows H2AX phosphorylation, we hypothesize that the downstream part of the DNA damage response signaling pathway may be impaired in cells from RS patients. At 2 and 24 h post-irradiation, we did not find any difference between RS and NOR patients in either \u03b3H2AX or 53BP1 (Figures 6 and 7). Thus, only early stages of DNA damage response may be impaired in cells from RS patients, while later stages seem to be unaffected. The ROC analysis of the DNA repair foci data obtained 30 min after irradiation revealed an AUC value of 1 for 53BP1 and co-localizing \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 foci (Figure S7). Calculation of the post hoc statistical power using the mean values and standard deviations of \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 foci per cell showed a very high statistical power of 1, suggesting that the sample size was adequate and results are statistically significant.

Finally, we analyzed DNA repair foci and\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 1122 12 of 18\napoptosis induced by in vitro irradiation in the PBL of breast cancer patients in relation to individual radiosensitivity. We studied \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 foci in 57 BC patients before, 24 h after the 4th fraction of RT, one month and one year after RT. In PBL taken before the RT, we found a higher level of \u03b3H2AX and significantly higher level of 53BP1 in RS patients, as compared to NOR patients. The elevated-level residual DNA repair foci suggest higher DNA damage in the RS patients. However, this increase in the level of DNA damage did not lead to apoptosis, probably due to the fact that in vivo apoptotic cells are phagocytized by macrophages and, thus, were not detectable in the bloodstream of patients. Other research groups have previously reported similar observations of increased levels of DNA damage in the PBL of patients, which develop severe acute normal tissue reactions following RT [3,31\u201334], although other studies did not find such an association [2,35,36]. However, neither previous studies nor our current research demonstrated sufficient sensitivity and specificity of the \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 foci analysis prior to RT for clinical identification of the RS patients. While a previous study by Markova et al. reported a negative correlation between the accumulation of late apoptotic/necrotic (LAN) and the level of 53BP1 and also positive correlation with individual RS [2], our current study did not reveal any correlation of DNA repair foci with the level of LAN cells. There are few methodological differences between studies, which may account for such inconsistency in the results. First, while patients were grouped into three groups, G0, G1 and G2-G3, by Markova et al. [2], we merged the G0 and G1 patients in order to gain a larger NOR group to compare with the group of RS patients, which consisted of G2 patients only. Second, while foci have previously been analyzed automatically using Metafer software with the custom-made classifier, we enumerated foci using a new semi-automated classifier, providing a possibility to manually correct the errors made by the automated classifier. In line with our current results, Djuzenova et al., reported a higher level of \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 foci in RS BC patients prior to RT [3]. One main discrepancy between ours and Djuzenova\u2019s study is the significantly higher prevalence of the G2/G3 patients in Djuzenova et al.\u2019s study. While we revealed relatively low acute toxicity, namely 5 G2 and 0 G3 RS patients out of 57 total patients, Djuzenova et al., reported 20/69 G2 and 6/69 G3 patients. The reason for such a huge difference in the prevalence of RS breast cancer patients, which was also reported in our previous study [2], remains unknown. In order to increase the total number of RS patients in our study, we enrolled those treated with CHT before the start of RT. Although the occurrence of RS patients was very similar in those two groups (3 CHT + RT and 2 RT alone), our results revealed a higher initial level of \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 foci in the CHT + RT group that persisted up to 24 h after 4th fraction, suggesting higher genotoxicity of CHT as compared to RT. On the other hand, CHT induced some kind of adaptive response against radiation-induced effects that was observed in the accumulation of dicentric chromosomes during RT. In line with previous studies [2,3], we also detected a lower level of \u03b3H2AX and co-localizing \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 foci one year after the RT in comparison to the level before RT. We hypothesized that a higher level of genetic instability in patients diagnosed with cancer compared to healthy controls [3,34] could resume to the normal healthy state following successful cancer treatment. This process is observed as a lower level of \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 foci one year post-RT in comparison to data observed before the start of RT. To validate the results of our in vivo analysis, we performed a set of in vitro experiments with PBL from four RS and four matched NOR patients, in which we analyzed \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 foci 30 min, 2 h and 24 h after the 2 Gy of \u03b3-rays in order to access primary and residual foci. Similar to the previously published data, the peak level of foci was detectable at 30 min post-IR [24,37]. For the detection of residual foci, the 24 h post-radiation timepoint was shown to be reliable, since all primary foci had already vanished and only residual foci remained until that time [37,38]. Our results revealed an increased level of primary 53BP1 and co-localizing \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 foci in PBL of RS patients, as analyzed 30 min after irradiation with 2 Gy. However, we acquired only 4 RS and 4 NOR patients\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 1122 13 of 18\nin our in vitro experiments. Interestingly, the statistical power calculated post hoc based on the mean values and standard deviations of \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 per cell was 1, which is in line with the results of ROC analyses where the AUC was also 1, strongly suggesting statistical significance in our results. However, due to the limited number of enrolled RS patients, the obtained data should be further confirmed in a larger group of patients. On the other hand, the increased level of endogenous foci found in in vivo conditions was not confirmed through in vitro examination. The likely reason was the freezing/thawing procedure that preceded the in vitro experiments. This procedure could lead to the elimination of damaged cells that were not able to survive the stress caused by the freezing/thawing. Djuzenova et al. also showed a difference in the response of RS patients to in vitro radiation when they analyzed cells from breast cancer patients with an adverse acute skin reaction (G3) to RT [3]. Their results showed significantly increased radiation-induced \u03b3H2AX foci 30 min after 50 cGy and the protracted disappearance of \u03b3H2AX foci, as analyzed 24 h after 2 Gy compared to the group of BC patients with normal skin reaction (G0\u20131) [3]. Chua et al. observed a higher level of residual co-localizing \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 in RS patients 24 h after in vitro irradiation with 4 Gy of IR [31] but no difference in primary foci, which is in contrast to our data. Lobachevsky et al. backtracked G3-4 RS cancer patients and analyzed the levels of \u03b3H2AX foci at six different timepoints after in vitro irradiation of their PBL [6]. Subsequently, they plotted the unrepairable component of \u03b3H2AX foci against the foci repair rate and found both higher unrepairable component and decreased repair rate of \u03b3H2AX foci in the G3-G4 RS patients [6]. We conclude that in vivo-defined endogenous \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 foci before the start of RT and also in vitro radiation-induced primary foci analyzed in PBL could be suggested as biomarkers for assessing individual RS. We also analyzed the late healthy tissue side effects but did not observe any correlation with in vivo-defined foci level; however, the statistical power of this analysis was low. Our results support the reports by other research groups that also did not find any correlation between the level of DNA repair foci and late healthy tissue side effects [36,39,40]. However, some other studies reported differences between patients with late healthy tissue side effects and patients with normal response [32,41,42], suggesting that more data need to be accumulated to confirm the possibility of using \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 DNA repair foci for the prediction of late healthy tissue side effects induced by RT. We studied apoptosis before, during and after RT in the MNC populations, namely: lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils and CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. No difference was found between RS and NOR patients, which is in contrast to our previous study where we analyzed the percentage of late apoptotic/necrotic (LAN) lymphocytes using Trypan blue assay and observed correlation with individual RS [2]. We applied, here, the flow-cytometry-based assessment of LAN cells using 7AAD staining that provided the possibility to analyze many more apoptotic cells in comparison to the Trypan blue assay used in our previous study (ten thousand vs. hundreds of cells, respectively). In addition, in the current study, we analyzed LAN cells in whole blood in contrast to analysis of LAN cells after LSM separation of MNC, as carried out by Markova et al. [2]. Although no difference between RS and NOR patients was observed, we found a decreased percentage of live cells in neutrophils and HSPCs as compared to lymphocytes, suggesting that these populations are more sensitive to RT. However, the primary site for HSPCs is bone marrow, and these cells are released into the blood when needed. Thus, the number of apoptotic HSPCs in blood, defined by us, does not represent the total number of dead HSPCs in the body. Next, we did not observe any effect of CHT treatment on the level of apoptosis. This is due to the time difference between the CHT and RT that was usually at least one month. This time is likely sufficient for the removal of cells killed by CHT from the blood. Changes observed in the in vivo-defined CA/MN/foci were not accompanied by changes in apoptosis, which could be explained by the fact that all apoptotic cells underwent phagocytosis in the blood. Next, we performed an investigation of radiation-induced apoptosis using the Annexin/7-AAD assay through the set of in vitro experiments that did not show any difference between RS and NOR patient groups, as opposed to some literature\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 1122 14 of 18\ndata [14,30]. Inverse correlation between lymphocyte apoptosis after in vitro radiation exposure and chronic toxicity after RT have been observed in other studies with PBL from prostate cancer patients [43,44]. However, we did not observe any correlation between the chronic toxicity and in vitro radiation-induced apoptosis in our study, probably because the chronic toxicities after prostate RT are usually much more severe compared to breast RT. In conclusion, we found no evidence showing a difference in the level of in vivo- or in vitro-induced apoptosis between RS and NOR patients. For the first time, we assessed the effect of radiosensitivity and chemotherapy in the PBL of BC patients using CA and CBMN assays. Vinnikov et al. reviewed the available studies considering the possibility to predict individual radiosensitivity using CA and CBMN techniques and found both positive [21,31,45] and negative results [46,47] for both assays [48]. In our study, we observed a trend to a higher level of endogenous MN in RS patients prior the RT but no difference between the RS and NOR patients by monitoring ring and dicentric CA. It has previously been shown that chronic exposure to low doses of IR can elevate the levels of dicentric and ring CA, as shown in occupational workers [49]. Here, we also observed a significant increase in MN and dicentrics but not ring chromosomes in the PBL of breast cancer patients during the RT. In line with our data for dicentrics and MN, we also found an increased level of DNA repair foci after four fractions of RT. On the other hand, in contrast to radiation-induced DNA repair foci, which vanished after the end of RT, the elevated level of MN and dicentrics was still observed after the course of RT. Our results are in line with several studies considering other types of cancer [27,50\u201352]. Gamulin et al. studied dicentrics, rings and MN in cancer patients before, during and after the RT and observed the accumulation of dicentrics, rings and MN biomarkers induced by RT [50]. Moquet et al. analyzed the level of dicentrics in the PBL of cancer patients and saw an accumulation of dicentric chromosomes in all patients [28]. The BC patients accumulated the least number of dicentric chromosomes in comparison to other tumor locations, such as prostate, lung, endometrium, esophagus and colon, due to the lower volume of healthy tissue exposed to radiation. The frequency of dicentrics before the last fraction of RT observed by Moquet et al. correlates well with our data. Here, we detected the same frequency of dicentric chromosomes, around 4% in the PBL of BC patients one month after the RT, suggesting the persistence of RT-induced dicentric chromosomes up to one month after the RT. Hartel et al. analyzed dicentric chromosomes in the PBL of prostate cancer patients right after, one and 2.5 years after radiotherapy and found 6, 4 and 3% of dicentrics, respectively [53], which is very similar to our observations of 4% dicentrics one month after the RT in BC patients. The aforementioned observations suggested that analysis of dicentrics is the best biomarker to assess the damage induced by RT, since the elevated values of dicentrics and MN remained detectable up to 1 month after RT and up to 2.5 years after RT in other studies [50,51,53]. We also observed a higher level of dicentric chromosomes and MN in the cells of RS patients 24 h after the 4th fraction of RT that could be caused by the lower efficiency of DNA repair and subsequent higher damage affecting CA and MN. In conclusion, CA and CBMN assays may have great value for studying the genomic instability induced by ionizing radiation since it accumulates and preserves for a longer time compared to DNA repair foci. A consideration of the mixed results in the available studies\u2019 application for the assessment of individual radiosensitivity must be confirmed in a larger study with a higher number of patients."

A higher level of in vitro radiation-induced primary 53BP1 DNA repair foci was also found in the PBL of RS patients as compared to the NOR patients. Based on our data and the literature data, we conclude that a number of experimental parameters should be considered while DNA repair foci are being potentially used for\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 1122 15 of 18\nthe assessment of individual RS. Analysis of apoptosis, either in vivo or in vitro, was not shown to be a predictive biomarker for assessing individual RS in our study. Only a trend to higher baseline levels of micronuclei in RS patients was revealed, while this increase was not significant. MN and CA analysis was able to detect the accumulation of damage during RT and may find application in assessing the risk of long-term IR-induced DNA damage. A combination of several molecular biomarkers may provide a sensitive tool for assessing the individual radiosensitivity.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/biomedicines11041122/s1, Figure S1: Cell images in vivo foci; Figure S2: ROC analysis in vivo; Figure S3: Foci late toxicity; Figure S4: Representative images CA and MN; Figure S5: CA and MN effect of CHT; Figure S6: CA and MN late toxicity; Figure S7: ROC analysis in vitro foci; Figure S8: Apoptosis in vitro.
