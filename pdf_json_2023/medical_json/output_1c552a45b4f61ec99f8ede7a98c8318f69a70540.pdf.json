A concern in many nearshore areas is the microbiological quality of the waters because of the combined effects of human activity, animal populations, and climatic variability. The consumption of shell sh contaminated with microbiological pathogens can cause illness, which impacts directly on the industry through loss of sales and loss of consumer con dence, and may also have cascading effects on health services (Campos & Lees, 2014). Pollution events causing shell sh harvest closures represent a real cost to coastal communities that are socially and nancially dependent on these resources (Evans et al., 2016). To protect the health of consumers and ensure a viable industry, many countries undertake hygiene controls at the primary production and processing stages.\nPre-harvest controls usually comprise the identi cation of actual/potential sources of contamination in the shell sh growing area and upstream catchment (sanitary surveys), together with a classi cation of the growing area based on monitoring of faecal indicator bacteria (faecal coliforms; Escherichia coli) in water/shell sh (FAO & WHO, 2018). Bacterial monitoring indicates the risk of faecal contamination, and the need to impose additional, short-term measures to reduce the risk of contamination to an \u201cacceptable\u201d level. The classi cation of growing areas determines whether the growing areas can be used for commercial harvesting and the post-harvest treatment (relaying, depuration, cooking) required, if any, before the shell sh can be marketed for human consumption.\nPage 3/22\nPoint sources of contamination such as discharges from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), septic tanks and combined sewer over ows are easily identi able, and their associated contaminant loadings can be estimated with accuracy (Garreis, 1994). In contrast, loadings from diffuse sources such as runoff from livestock farms, and faecal inputs from wildlife are more di cult to determine (Rees et al., 2010). In recent decades, faecal source tracking (FST) tools have greatly improved our ability to identify and quantify the contribution of individual pollution sources to the total microbiological load affecting shell sh growing areas (Cornelisen et al., 2011; Harwood et al., 2014; Symonds et al., 2017; Gyawali & Hewitt, 2020). For instance, FST tools can be used to identify sources of episodic high microbiological contamination detected during the o cial control monitoring of growing areas (Mieszkin et al., 2013; FAO & WHO, 2018).\nIn Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ), most commercial shell sh growing areas are remote from large population centres and from point sources of domestic wastewater. Consequently, the microbiological quality of the waters is generally very good (Greening & McCoubrey, 2010). However, a small number of growing areas experience episodic water quality deterioration leading to harvest closures. One such example is Papanui Inlet (PI), in the Otago Peninsula, which had a commercial tuaki (Austrovenus stutchburyi) shery from 1983 until 2006. In 2006, commercial harvest in the inlet was closed because faecal indicator bacteria concentrations exceeded \u201cApproved\u201d classi cation standards. Since then, there has been no commercial harvesting of tuaki in the inlet (Ministry for Primary Industries, 2017; Boyd, 2008).\nSeveral sources of faecal contamination have been proposed to cause the elevated concentrations of indicator bacteria, including birds (wildfowl, waders, and gulls), livestock, human wastewater discharges, and marine mammals (e.g., New Zealand fur seals Arctocephalus forsteri and New Zealand sea lions Phocarctos hookeri) (Simpson et al., 2017). Given the rural character of the catchment and the absence of any land-based continuous sources of domestic wastewater to the inlet, the source(s) of intermittent contamination affecting the classi cation status of the growing area has been debated. Thus, PI has been cited as an example of a growing area where better on-site treatment of wastewater and improved water quality could increase returns from shell sh harvesting (Ministry for the Environment, 2008).\nThis study combined information from a sanitary survey, microbiological monitoring (FST markers and Escherichia coli) of tuaki and water, bacterial loading and budget estimations, and hydrometeorological modelling to inform a \u2018weight of evidence\u2019 (WoE) approach to identify sources of faecal indicator bacteria, and inform the managers of PI growing area. Given the rural character of the study area, it was hypothesised that the elevated E. coli concentrations contributing to shell sh harvest closures in the inlet would be predominantly associated with contamination from animal sources.\nMaterials And Methods\nDescription of study area and cockle shery Papanui Inlet (45\u00b084 S, 170\u00b069 E) is a small inlet (3.7 km2) on the east coast of Otago Peninsula, approx. 12 km to the northeast of the city of Dunedin (Fig. 1). The inlet is approximately 1.5 km wide by 3.75 km long, very shallow (average depths = 1\u20132 m at high tide) and much of its tidal area (65\u201370%) is exposed at low tides (Albrecht & Vennell, 2007). PI experiences mixed semi-diurnal tides (Albrecht & Vennell, 2007). Because of its\nPage 4/22\nlong, narrow, shallow channel, constricted mouth, and relatively large tidal area, water movements in the inlet are affected by \u2018tidal choking\u2019 which reduces water exchange with the ocean (Albrecht & Vennell, 2007). Salinity and temperature ranges reported in the literature are 32\u201335 ppt and 6\u201319\u00b0C, respectively (Roper & Jillett, 1981). The PI catchment is approximately 10 km2 and four small streams discharge to the inlet (Enright, 2006). The predominant winds are from the southwest during winter and from the northeast during summer (Macara 2015). The inlet is surrounded by pasture and small areas of indigenous forest with a small number of dwellings on the southern shore (LRIS, 2020). Many of the dwellings are used as holiday homes, but some are occupied permanently.\nThe distribution of tuaki is limited by tide and sediment characteristics with higher tuaki densities occur in the top 10 cm of the sediment, in areas with soft mud to ne sand between the mid and the low water. Tuaki are virtually absent from areas near rivers/streams (Kainamu, 2010). Mean body size of tuaki generally reduces with distance from the entrance of the inlet (Kainamu, 2010).\nTuaki have been harvested commercially using hand dredges pulled through the sandy substratum, collecting the bivalves into a wire basket. The tuaki were then emptied into mesh bags, loaded on to a boat, and taken to a processing factory in Dunedin. Harvesting occurred year-round according to market demands (Simpson et al., 2017). The shell sh growing area has had an inconsistent microbiological classi cation status with periodic downgrades (Simpson et al., 2017). Currently, the growing area is classi ed as \u201cRestricted\u201d and therefore tuaki can only be marketed for human consumption after relaying or processing (depuration or an approved cooking method such as canned product) (Ministry for Primary Industries, 2018). However, commercial harvest is considered uneconomic under these conditions (Simpson et al., 2017).\nSanitary survey A sanitary survey of PI was undertaken by Aquatic Reporting and Compliance Ltd in 2017 in accordance with the requirements of the Animal Products Notice: Regulated Control Scheme \u2013 Bivalve Molluscan Shell sh for Human Consumption (Ministry for Primary Industries, 2018). The survey comprised a desk evaluation of the sources of faecal contamination in the shell sh growing area and an assessment of the potential impact of these sources on the classi cation status of the growing area. A physical inspection of the shoreline and areas of the catchment area adjacent to the growing area was also undertaken by personnel of Aquatic Reporting Compliance Ltd, and of Southern Clams Ltd on 1 February 2017 to con rm the presence of the pollution sources identi ed in the desk study.\nSample collection Seawater samples (1,000 mL) were collected from four sites (Sites 1\u20134 in Fig.\u00a01) and samples of tuaki (> 30 individuals) were collected from two sites (A and E, represented in Fig.\u00a01) in PI during the period January 2015\u2013December 2017. These samples were collected at a minimum of monthly intervals following Adverse Pollution Condition criteria (Simpson et al., 2017) although unfavourable weather conditions, tides, and availability of sampling personnel meant that samples were not collected every month. Over the course of the study, a total of 82 water and 40 tuaki samples were collected. Upon collection, the samples were placed in\nPage 5/22\ncool boxes with freezer packs and sent to the Cawthron Institute, Nelson, New Zealand for microbiological testing. The DNA from all samples was extracted within 24 h of collection and stored at -20oC in accordance with sampling protocols outlined in Cornelisen et al. (2012).\nMicrobiological analyses\nCulturable Escherichia coli A sub-sample (100 mL) of each seawater sample was analysed for E. coli using a culture-based assay (APHA (online) 9223B) (APHA, 1992). Twelve tuaki from each sample were homogenised and analysed for E. coli using a most probable number (MPN) method based on ISO/TS 16649-3 (Burrow, 2020). The theoretical limits of detection of the APHA and MPI assays are 10 MPN 100 mL\u2212 1 and 20 MPN 100 g\u2212 1, respectively (APHA, 1992; Burrow, 2020). Genomic DNA extraction Seawater samples (900 mL) were ltered through 0.45 \u00b5m pore, 47 mm diameter mixed cellulose ester membranes (Advantec, Tokyo, Japan). DNA was extracted from the lters using Mo Bio PowerSoil DNA Isolation kits (Mo Bio Laboratories, Inc, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\nDNA was extracted from tuaki by dissecting out the digestive gland from 12 animals using the protocol of Kirs and Cornelisen (2011). Digestive glands were homogenised and weighed. Disposable scalpel blades were used once and discarded, scalpel handles, and forceps were sterilised by soaking in 10% sodium hypochlorite solution and then autoclaved at 121oC for 30 minutes. Digestive glands were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C with shaking at 200 rpm in a volume of phosphate buffered saline equal to the weight of the homogenised digestive glands, and with proteinase K 100 \u00b5g mL\u2212 1 ( nal concentration). The next day, 250 \u00b5L of the slurry was mixed with 350 \u00b5L of buffer ML1 from an EZNA Mollusc DNA extraction kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, USA) and incubated at 60\u00b0C for 10 minutes. Next, 350 \u00b5l of chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (24:1) was added to the slurry, vortexed, and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 2 minutes. The upper aqueous phase was transferred to a new screw top tube, 550 \u00b5L of buffer MBL and 10 \u00b5L of RNAse was added, mixed, and incubated at 70\u00b0C for 10 minutes. 500 \u00b5L of ethanol (100%) was added to the slurry. The Mollusc kit\u2019s silica columns were conditioned by loading the columns with 100 \u00b5L of equilibration buffer and then centrifuged at 13,000 g for 60 seconds. 750 \u00b5L of sample was then added to the conditioned column and centrifuged at 13,000 g for 60 seconds. The column was then washed with 500 \u00b5L of buffer HB (10,000 g for 30 seconds) and then with 700 \u00b5L of wash buffer (10,000 g for 30 seconds). After a nal centrifugation (15,000 g for 2 minutes), the DNA was eluted from the columns in 100 \u00b5L of elution buffer pre heated to 70\u00b0C. Eluted DNA was stored at -20\u00b0C for a maximum of six months before analysis. Faecal source tracking markers DNA extracted from water and tuaki was used as a template for PCRs targeting the 16S rRNA gene of \u201cuniversal\u201d faecal bacteria and host-speci c faecal bacteria (quantitative PCR for universal and bovine speci c) (Shanks et al., 2008; Siefring et al., 2008), and endpoint PCR for human, waterfowl, and gull speci c bacteria) (Bernhard & Field, 2000; Devane et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2008).\nPage 6/22\nQuantitative PCR (qPCR) tests The universal assay used Express qPCR master mix (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) 10 \u00b5L, primers GenBac F3 and GenBac R4 (10 \u00b5M) 1 \u00b5L, 0.2 \u00b5L of a FAM labelled probe with BHQ quenching (Siefring et al., 2008) (10 \u00b5M) 0.2 \u00b5L and water 6 \u00b5L. Two \u00b5L of DNA was used as the template. Thermcycler conditions were 50oC initially for two minutes then 95oC for two minutes, followed by 40 cycles at 95oC for 15 secondes and 60oC at 15 seconds. Fluorescence at 517 nm in response to excitation from light at 495 nm was measured at the end of each 60oC annealing step, and used to identify positive reactions.\nThe bovine assay used Express qPCR master mix (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) 10 \u00b5L, primers Cow M2F and Cow M2R, (10 \u00b5M) 1 \u00b5L each, 0.2 \u00b5L of a FAM labelled probe with BHQ quenching, water 6 \u00b5L (Shanks et al., 2008) and 2 \u00b5L of template. Fluorescence was measured as for the universal test.\nBoth qPCR tests were run on a Rotorgene Q thermocycler (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands).\nEndpoint tests Endpoint PCR used 18 \u00b5L aliquots of each master mix and 2 \u00b5L of DNA template, except for the second avian E2 (waterfowl ) PCR which used 19 \u00b5L aliquots of master mix and 1 \u00b5L of template. Ampli cation of target DNA was visualised by running 8 \u00b5L of the PCR on a 2% agarose gel stained with RedSafe (1%) at 70 V for 40 minutes. Human endpoint assay The human assay used GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) 10 \u00b5L, primers Bac 183 and Bac708 (10 \u00b5M) 1 \u00b5L, water 6 \u00b5L. The aliquots were initially heated to 94\u00b0C for 3.5 minutes, and then subjected to 10 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 45 seconds, a touchdown annealing pro le with the initial annealing temperature of 65oC decreasing by 1oC every two cycles for 5 cycles, and then by 1oC per cycle until 55oC was reached. The PCRs were then subjected to 30 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 45 seconds, 55oC for 30 seconds, and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds, with a nal extension of 72\u00b0C for eight minutes. Gull endpoint assay The gull assay master mix contained GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) 10 \u00b5L, primer Gull 2F and Gull 2R (10 \u00b5M) 0.8 \u00b5L, water 6.4 \u00b5L. The aliquots were initially heated to 94\u00b0C for 3.5 minutes, and then subjected to 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 45 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 30 seconds and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds, with a nal extension of 72\u00b0C for eight minutes. Avian E2 endpoint assay A semi-nested PCR was used to amplify wildfowl speci c bacterial DNA following the method of Devane et al. (2007), except that GoTaq DNA polymerase was used instead of Amplitaq DNA polymerase.\nIndicator bacterial loadings and budgets\nPage 7/22\nFaecal coliform loadings were estimated using the Bacterial Indicator Tool (USEPA 2000). This tool quanti es the inputs of faecal coliforms to streams/estuaries from animals and failing septic systems. Data used as input to the model were:\nLand use distribution for each sub-catchment (built-up, forest, cropland, and pastureland) derived from the New Zealand Land Cover Database (LCDB) v5.0 (LRIS, 2020).\nNumber of agricultural animals in each sub-catchment; obtained from the sanitary survey.\nWildlife densities for forest, cropland, and pastureland in the study area; obtained from the sanitary survey.\nNumber of septic systems in the study area; obtained from the sanitary survey.\nNumber of people served by septic systems in the study area; obtained from the sanitary survey.\nFailure rate of septic systems in the study area; assumed to be 25%.\nHydrometeorological modelling The relationships between concentrations of E. coli in tuaki and the environmental conditions on the day of sampling were studied using multiple regression. The E. coli data used in this analysis were from the regulatory monitoring programme and cover the period January 2015\u2013September 2020. Weather data (daily measurements of air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, solar radiation) covering the same period were downloaded from the archives of the weather station monitor of the Department of Physics, University of Otago, located in the city of Dunedin (http://www.physics.otago.ac.nz/eman/weather_station/current.php). These environmental variables were assumed to in uence E. coli delivery to PI from the potential sources investigated.\nStatistical analyses Log10-transformations were applied to E. coli concentrations in tuaki from sites A and E to improve parametricity. The E. coli concentrations in shell sh were tested for temporal trend magnitudes using Sen\u2019s Slope Estimator and a linear regression method, and for seasonality using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Multiple regression, using the stepwise selection procedure, was used to investigate the relationships between E. coli concentrations in tuaki and environmental conditions on the day of sampling. Escherichia coli concentrations were considered as dependent variables, predicted by independent variables (season, water temperature (\u00b0C), relative humidity (%), wind speed (m s\u2212 1), wind direction (degrees), and solar radiation (W m\u2212 2). Rainfall was not included in the regression model because the number of signi cant rainfall events (\u2265 50 mm) in the catchment is very low and because the sanitary survey did not nd signi cant correlations between rainfall and E. coli concentrations in tuaki (Simpson et al., 2017). The skewness of each independent variable was examined to determine if any exceeded 1 and therefore required log10-transformation. The statistical relationships were assessed using the coe cient of determination (r2), adjusted for degrees of freedom using Minitab. All tests were assessed at the 95% con dence level. Statistical analyses were performed using Minitab v.19.\nPage 8/22\nWeight of evidence assessment A weight of evidence (WoE) is a process that collects, analyses, and evaluates a combination of different qualitative, semi-quantitative or quantitative lines of evidence to support an overall assessment of water quality (ANZECC & ARMCANZ, 2000). In this study, the WoE assessment analysed lines of evidence through a pressure\u2013stressor\u2013ecosystem receptor causal pathway.\nResults\nPollution sources and associated bacterial loadings Estimated total numbers of animals and associated faecal coliform loadings in the PI catchment are presented in Table 1. Ruminant livestock (sheep, goats, cattle) are the most abundant. Inputs from sheep alone contribute 55% of the total loading to PI. Together, faecal contamination inputs from livestock sources (80%) were estimated to contribute a much greater proportion of the total loading than wildlife sources (20.2%). Black swans were estimated to contribute 13% of the loading and are locally important given that they represent direct faecal inputs to the shell sh growing area. The loading attributed to fur seals and sea lions was estimated to contribute 7% of the total loading. The coliform loadings presented in Table 1 are at least 2log10 higher than the estimated loading from failing septic tank discharges (1.3 x 108 bacteria/day, assuming 10 septic tanks serving 20 people, and a 25% failure rate in the catchment).\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTable 1 Faecal coliform loading from livestock and wildlife in the Papanui Inlet catchment.\nSource Number of\nanimalsa Faecal coliform loading (bacteria/day)\nPercent contribution\nSheep 1,000 1.4 x 1013 55.15\nGoats 200 3.6 x 1012 14.13\nBlack swans 500 3.4 x 1012 13.18\nCattle 50 2.7 x 1012 10.51\nFur seals/sea lions\n200 1.8 x 1012 6.99\nOther birds 1,000 1.0 x 1010 0.04\na Estimated from the sanitary survey.\nEscherichia coli concentrations in water and tuaki\nPage 9/22\nIn NZ, o cial shell sh growing area classi cations are based on median E. coli concentrations calculated on a minimum of 15 samples (Ministry for Primary Industries, 2018). Concentrations of E. coli in water samples were very low and ranged from < 1 to 31 at sites 1 and 2, from < 1 to 87 at site 3, and from < 1 to 20 at site 4 (all in MPN 100 mL\u2212 1).\nThe Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code allows E. coli concentrations higher than 230 MPN 100 g\u2212 1 in only one of ve shell sh samples (no samples can exceed 700 MPN 100 g\u2212 1) (Food Standards Australia & New Zealand, 2019). During the monitoring period, 13 samples had E. coli concentrations that equalled or exceeded 230 MPN 100 g\u2212 1 of esh. Escherichia coli concentrations in tuaki ranged from 20 to 2,400 at site A and from < 20 to 1,300 at site E (all in MPN 100 g\u2212 1). Compliance with the E. coli limit for \u201cApproved\u201d classi cation was lower in shell sh than in water samples (Table 2). The upper limits were not considered in this analysis.\nNo evidence was found for seasonality of E. coli concentrations at sites A and E during the monitoring period.\n\u00a0\nTable 2 Compliance of water and shell sh samples with the microbiological criteria of the Animal Products Noticea.\nSampling site\n(sample matrix)\nn (%) samples with E. coli < Approved status (lower limit)b\nn (%) samples with E. coli < Restricted status (lower limit)c\n1 (water) 31 (96.9) 32 (100)\n2 (water) 33 (97.1) 34 (100)\n3 (water) 31 (91.2) 34 (100)\n4 (water) 33 (97.1) 34 (100)\nA (shell sh)\n26 (74.3) 35 (100)\nE (shell sh)\n27 (77.1) 35 (100)\na In NZ, shell sh growing areas may be classi ed as \u2018Remote Approved\u201d, \u201cApproved\u201d, \u201cConditionally Approved\u201d, \u201cRestricted\u201d, \u201cConditionally Restricted\u201d and \u201cLimited\u201d.

The most common positive marker in seawater samples was the seagull endpoint marker (54.2%) and in tuaki were the bovine and seagull (12.5%) (Fig. 2). Thirteen of the 46 shell sh samples tested for faecal source tracking markers had E. coli concentrations \u2265 230 MPN 100 g\u2212 1.

At site A, solar radiation (entered at step 1; negative) was the only predictive variable associated with bacterial levels, with an explained variance of 25%. A heat map of these E. coli results shows that the highest E. coli results generally occurred in the summer months (Fig. 3). At site E, E. coli concentrations were signi cantly associated with wind speed (entered at step 1; positive) and relative humidity (entered at step 2; negative), and with explained variances of 14% and 21%, respectively.\nDiscussion\nPage 11/22\nEvaluation of lines of evidence\u00a0 Identifying the causes of episodic elevated E. coli contamination in PI is challenging because of the rural character of the catchment, and the limited data available to characterise pollution sources and associated microbial loadings.

However, the nearest municipal wastewater treatment plant (Tahuna WWTP) (Fig. 1) is outside the PI catchment, and discharges treated e uent to the coastal marine environment \u224822 km to the southwest of the mouth of the inlet. A regional hydrodynamic and particle tracking model developed in our laboratory to simulate the transport of particles in the top 3 m of the water column indicates some connectivity between the coastal outfall and the mouth of PI (data not presented). However, while E. coli concentrations associated with point sources of wastewater have been recorded exceeding 230 MPN 100 g-1 > 10 km from the discharge point (Lee & Glover, 1998), the high dilution available in the marine environment around the Otago Peninsula, together with the low number of samples positive for human-speci c marker, suggests it is unlikely that wastewater from Tahuna WWTP or Green Island WWTP affects water quality in PI.\u00a0\nThe other potential source of human faecal contamination in PI is local septic tank discharges from holiday houses. There are approximately 40 dwellings in the PI catchment and most of these are < 150 m from the shoreline (Simpson et al., 2017). The sanitary survey identi ed 11 holiday houses on the southern shores of the inlet that could be sources of intermittent human faecal contamination (Simpson et al., 2017). In some of these dwellings, people use rudimentary pit latrines, simple buckets, or chemical toilets for waste handling. However, the paucity of positive tests for the human marker does not support a human source for the high E. coli\u00a0concentrations.\nFew samples were positive for bovine-speci c faecal bacteria and for sheep DNA suggesting low levels of faecal contamination from these sources despite the estimated faecal coliform loadings from livestock representing \u224880% of the total loading onto the inlet\u2019s terrestrial catchment.\u00a0Many of these faecal bacteria are excreted onto land (in contrast to most of the loading from waterfowl and wading birds) and therefore a proportion of the land-excreted bacteria is attenuated through settlement and decay in the streams before reaching tidal waters. It is noteworthy that bacterial concentrations in tuaki are not correlated with rainfall (Simpson et al., 2017) and therefore it is not expected that E. coli\u00a0concentrations would be elevated during periods of high ow in the streams. The sanitary survey report states that livestock numbers in the catchment have declined markedly and that this would have reduced the faecal inputs to the inlet (Simpson et al., 2017). However, we found no signi cant increasing/decreasing trend in the E. coli concentrations in tuaki.\u00a0\nThe seagull speci c FST test was the commonest positive result (54% of samples). The red-billed gull has been observed during slow walk counts undertaken regularly on the southern shores of the inlet since 2010 (Birds New Zealand, 2017; Ewans, 2017). Other birds (e.g., falcon, pied oystercatcher, spoonbill, variable\nPage 14/22\noystercatcher, spur-winged plover, pied stilt) occur in low numbers in the PI catchment (Ewans, 2017). A study of the speci city of the gull test with NZ faecal samples found no cross-reactivity with 22 non-gull species (Kirs et al., 2011) suggesting that the results of the gull FST are likely true positives. Given the presence of gulls in PI and the speci city of the test, seagulls seem a likely source of some of the faecal bacteria to PI. However, our loading estimates indicate that these sources represent < 1% of the total faecal loading to the inlet.\u00a0\nFur seals have been observed to haul out in large numbers on rocky headlands and nearby pastures near the mouth of PI since the 1990s (Lalas & Bradshaw, 2001). Sea lions also haul out in large numbers in the same area, preferring mostly sandy beaches. Beentjes (1989) identi ed a population of 14 male animals using these areas from March 1986 to December 1987. In our faecal source apportionment modelling, these marine mammals were estimated to contribute \u22487% of the faecal coliform loading to the inlet. However, the quality of the evidence is very low because no detailed investigations were undertaken to con rm this estimate, and there are no faecal source tracing tests available for New Zealand marine mammals.\nThe second most frequent positive faecal source tracking test in water was for wildfowl-speci c bacteria. Ducks (Anas spp.) and black swans (Cygnus atratus) in PI were counted when the samples were collected, and up to 600 black swans were recorded on the inlet on some sampling days. Our estimates indicate that black swans can contribute as much as 13% of the total faecal coliform loading to PI.\u00a0\nCornelisen et al. (2012) found that the human-speci c, endpoint HBac Bacteroidales assay developed in the USA (Bernhard & Field 2000a, 2000b) also ampli ed genes from the gut bacteria of Australian brushtail possums and wallabies present in NZ (Kirs et al., 2011; Cornelisen et al., 2012). The predominantly pastoral habitat surrounding PI suggests the faecal contribution from possums is likely to be low. Additionally, possum control operations have been undertaken in the study catchment. During the period 2013\u20132017, it is estimated that these operations resulted in the removal of >11,000 possums (Ewans, 2017).\nThere was a striking difference in the concentrations of E. coli in the shell sh esh and the water with up to two orders of magnitude higher in tuaki than in the seawater the animals were ltering. The distributions of the E. coli\u00a0concentrations in both water and tuaki show a pattern of generally low concentrations with a small number of samples exceeding the \u201cApproved\u201d limit on scattered, isolated occasions. Even brief exposures to high faecal indicator bacterial concentrations in water can result in high esh concentrations in shell sh. Shell sh have been found to accumulate E. coli to maximum concentrations within 30 minutes of exposure to a sewage contamination source (Campos et al., 2013). This period of rapid accumulation is followed by an \u201cequilibrium\u201d phase (which depends upon the duration of exposure and the capacity of the animals to retain bacteria), followed by a period of bacterial elimination. The dynamics of accumulation, retention and clearance vary between shell sh species and between sites. However, on average, clams and cockles tend to accumulate bacteria to higher levels than oysters (Younger & Reese, 2013). \u00a0\nRelevance to shell sh growing area management\u00a0 The Restricted classi cation of PI is attributed to episodic contamination of tuaki. In PI, the mechanism of contamination is likely to be accumulation of E. coli by tuaki exposed to waters with low levels of faecal contamination for most of the time and intermittent elevated contamination from local animal sources. Clearly,\nPage 15/22\nfaecal contamination from wildlife sources (birds, marine mammals) is di cult to quantify and predict. The management of shell sh growing areas affected by these sources is challenging because of the unpredictable nature of the contamination events. The combination of sanitary survey results, loading and budget estimates, and hydrometeorological modelling in this study provided \u2018quantitative\u2019 information on the likely sources of elevated E. coli concentrations in PI. This study demonstrates that the application of these elements in combination is more effective in informing a WoE assessment than their application in isolation. The FST tools do not per se quantify the loading from each source impacting the shell sh growing area. However, the FST results provided context to the results of the sanitary survey and supported the argument that most of the faecal loading affecting PI is from animal rather than human sources. This is relevant because faecal contamination from human sources (e.g., domestic wastewater) generally presents greater health risk i.e., most cases of shell sh-related illness are caused by human enteric viruses (Bellou et al.,\u00a02013).\u00a0\nThe effect of intermittent contamination on shell sh quality is probably exacerbated during periods of tidal choking, when contaminated waters recirculate within the inlet. It is also likely that the infrequent sampling regime used in the o cial control programme does not detect this elevated E. coli in water but does detect increased E. coli\u00a0concentrations in the shell sh esh due to differences in the retention times of E. coli in the shell sh and in the inlet waters due to tidal ushing. To ensure that the monitoring regime in PI adequately represents the contributing sources identi ed in this study, we recommend more frequent sanitary surveys, and ne scale monitoring of E. coli during the tidal cycle and during periods of high abundance of birds and marine mammals. Tracer studies combining microbiological and chemical markers would also likely provide useful information on the links between septic tank discharges and shell sh water quality. The integration of sanitary surveys, microbiological and hydrometeorological modelling, and FST studies to inform a WoE approach can support management decisions for shell sh growing areas in rural catchments affected by intermittent faecal contamination.\u00a0\nConclusion Assessing multiple lines of information on the origin of contaminants to shell sh areas and using a weight of evidence approach can provide a better understanding of the risks that consumers face. In this study, we used sanitary survey information, faecal indicator bacteria concentrations, faecal microbial source tracking, bacterial source apportionment, and hydrometeorological modelling to assess the sources of faecal contamination affecting a shell sh growing area in a rural catchment. We conclude that the sources of the faecal contamination are predominantly non-human which changes the disease risk pro le from consuming potentially contaminated shell sh.\nDeclarations Competing Interests\nThe authors have no competing interests to declare.\u00a0\nEthical responsibilities of authors\nPage 16/22\nAll authors have read, understood, and have complied as applicable with the statement on \"Ethical responsibilities of Authors\" as found in the Instructions for Authors and are aware that with minor exceptions, no changes can be made to authorship once the paper is submitted.\u00a0\nAcknowledgements\nWe wish to thank Graeme Granger, Roger Belton, and David Redshaw from Southern Clams Ltd for collecting the shell sh and water samples.
