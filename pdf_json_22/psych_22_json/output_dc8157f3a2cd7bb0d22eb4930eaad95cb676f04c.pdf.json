For sustained attention\u2014the ongoing application of focus to a task, the effect appears to be\u00a0modest, and the underlying mechanisms of attention restoration remain unclear. Exposure to nature may improve attention performance through many means: modulation of alertness and one\u2019s connection to nature were investigated here, in two separate studies. In both studies, participants performed the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) before and immediately after viewing a meadow, ocean, or urban image for 40 s, and then completed the Perceived Restorativeness Scale. In Study 1 (n = 68), an eye-tracker recorded the participants\u2019 tonic pupil diameter during the SARTs, providing a measure of alertness. In Study 2 (n = 186), the effects of connectedness to nature on SART performance and perceived restoration were studied. In both studies, the image viewed was not associated with participants\u2019 sustained attention performance; both nature images were perceived as equally restorative, and more restorative than the urban image. The image viewed was not associated with changes in alertness. Connectedness to nature was not associated with sustained attention performance, but it did moderate the relation between viewing the natural images and perceived restorativeness; participants reporting a higher connection to nature also reported feeling more restored after viewing the nature, but not the urban, images. Dissociation was found between the physiological and behavioral measures and the perceived restorativeness of the images. The results suggest that restoration associated with nature exposure is not associated with modulation of alertness but is associated with connectedness with nature.\nKeywords: sustained attention, attention restoration theory, pupillometry, connectedness to nature, SART, waterscape, meadow, alertness\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 809629"

            "text": "Sustained attention is the skill of maintaining concentration and inhibiting distractions (Robertson et\u00a0 al., 1997), which is difficult to maintain and fluctuate over time (Williams et\u00a0 al., 2018). This important form of attention underpins more complex cognitive functions (Anderson and Doyle, 2004), and everyday tasks like driving (Robertson, 2003) and learning (Shannon et\u00a0al., 2021), making it a good candidate for nature interventions. Attention Restoration Theory (ART) proposes that exposure to particular environments, especially nature, helps to restore attention after depletion because natural environments gently capture externally-focused (exogenous) attention processes, thereby allowing internally-focused (endogenous) attention to rest and be\u00a0 replenished (Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989; Kaplan, 1995; Williams et\u00a0 al., 2018). Sustained attention has often (Hartig et\u00a0 al., 1991; Berto, 2005; Craig et\u00a0 al., 2015; Lee et\u00a0 al., 2015; Schutte et\u00a0al., 2017; Amicone et\u00a0al., 2019), but not always (Van den Berg et\u00a0 al., 2003; Nguyen et\u00a0 al., 2018; Cassarino et\u00a0 al., 2019; Hicks et\u00a0 al., 2020; Neilson et\u00a0 al., 2020), been associated with performance improvement after exposure to nature. Two recent meta-analyses revealed that the effect size of nature exposure on sustained attention performance was minimal (Ohly et\u00a0 al., 2016; Stevenson et\u00a0 al., 2018) and it was noted that the mechanisms underpinning the effects of nature exposure on sustained attention performance are not well understood (Stevenson et\u00a0 al., 2018). Here, two different mechanisms were examined in separately\u2014alertness and connectedness to nature.\nAlertness, being ready to respond, can be\u00a0divided into three forms, phasic alertness\u2014short-term readiness to make a response following a warning signal, tonic alertness\u2014baseline readiness linked to circadian rhythm and wakefulness, and intrinsic alertness\u2014voluntary readiness independent of external influences (Sturm and Willmes, 2001; Unsworth et\u00a0 al., 2018). Arousal, the non-specific activation of the brain during the wake state of the sleep\u2013wake cycle, overlaps conceptually with alertness, with the term alertness used when participants are performing cognitive processes (Oken et\u00a0al., 2006). Alertness can be\u00a0measured physiologically through the diameter of the pupil (Unsworth and Robison, 2016; Van den Brink et\u00a0 al., 2016; Unsworth et\u00a0 al., 2018) and via questionnaires such as the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (\u00c5kerstedt and Gillberg, 1990). Pupil size is partly driven by the release of noradrenalin throughout the neocortex by the locus coeruleus in the brainstem (Joshi et\u00a0al., 2016). Locus coeruleus activity closely corresponds with performance on vigilance tasks in monkeys (Aston-Jones et\u00a0al., 1999) and humans (Aln\u00e6s et\u00a0 al., 2014), pupil diameter (Aln\u00e6s et\u00a0al., 2014; Joshi et\u00a0al., 2016), and participant-reported arousal (Aln\u00e6s et\u00a0 al., 2014; Morris et\u00a0 al., 2020).\nTwo forms of pupillary response, phasic and tonic, can be\u00a0measured during a task. Phasic responses reflect momentary or task-induced changes in pupil size and are considered a measure of information processing load (Beatty, 1982). Tonic responses reflect a baseline pupillary response and are considered a measure of the internal state of alertness (Bradshaw, 1967; Beatty, 1982; Laeng et\u00a0 al., 2012). The\nrelations between locus coeruleus tonic activity and task performance on sustained attention tasks vary along an upside-down U shape, where high and low levels of locus coeruleus tonic activity are associated with poor task performance, but intermediate levels are associated with strong task performance (Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005; Oken et\u00a0al., 2006). Accordingly, small and large tonic pupil diameter measures are associated with attentional lapses, as indicated by increased errors, slowing of responses, and increasing variability in responding (Kristjansson et\u00a0al., 2009; Unsworth and Robison, 2016; Van den Brink et\u00a0 al., 2016; Unsworth et\u00a0 al., 2018). Sustained attention performance relies on a participant\u2019s intrinsic alertness (Oken et\u00a0 al., 2006) and is influenced by task-level factors including the pace (Parasuraman, 1979) and dullness of the task (Robertson et\u00a0 al., 1997). The task-level factors can be\u00a0 standardized by using one dull task, such as the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART; Robertson et\u00a0 al., 1997). Performance on the SART activates the brain networks involved in sustaining attention (Manly et\u00a0al., 2003) and correlates with the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ; Broadbent et\u00a0 al., 1982) and the Attention-Related Cognitive Errors Scale (ARCES; Carriere et\u00a0 al., 2008; Smilek et\u00a0 al., 2010).\nThree studies to date have examined the associations between nature images and pupil diameter; participants viewed photographs rated either high or low in restorative value (Nordh et\u00a0 al., 2010; Mart\u00ednez-Soto et\u00a0 al., 2019; Marois et\u00a0 al., 2021). Nordh and colleagues noted that pupil size was smaller when participants viewed park photos they rated as more restorative. They interpreted these results to suggest that the more restorative park photos might have heightened relaxation resulting in a constriction of the pupil. The other two papers, in contrast, found that pupil diameter was larger when participants viewed high compared with low restorative photos. Mart\u00ednez-Soto and colleagues interpreted these results within the context of the emotional valence of the photos, suggesting that a greater emotional response associated with higher restorative ratings of the photos was associated with a larger pupil size (Mart\u00ednezSoto et\u00a0 al., 2019). Marois and colleagues suggested that the nature images with higher restoration potential, the high-mystery images, may have prompter greater engagement of attention with the natural images (Marois et\u00a0 al., 2021). In the current study pupil diameter was used as a measure of alertness during a sustained attention task to investigate if exposure to nature was associated with sustained attention performance and modulation of alertness. Stevenson et\u00a0 al. (2018) determined that exposure to actual rather than virtual natural environments provided a stronger and more reliable effect on measures of working memory, attentional control, and cognitive flexibility. All the studies reviewed in the meta-analysis that measured sustained attention (vigilance) had presented participants with pictures (virtual) of environments (Stevenson et\u00a0 al., 2018). Here, pupil diameter was measured using a lab-based Tobii eye-tracker with a high (300 Hz) sampling rate to gain an accurate measurement of pupil size. Because of the lab-based eye-tracker, a choice was made to use pictures of nature rather than exposure to actual natural environments.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 809629\nResponses to natural and urban environments may be\u00a0 influenced by personal characteristics including identifying with, and connecting to, nature. For example, Wilkie and Stavridou (2013) showed that identifying with the country-side was associated with higher perceived restoration for natural images and lower perceived restoration for urban images, whereas preferring the city was associated with similar restoration ratings for natural and urban images (Wilkie and Stavridou, 2013). The effects on restoration outcomes appear less clear, with a follow-up study reporting similar differences for positive mood, but not for negative mood or attention (Wilkie and Clouston, 2015). Connectedness to nature is defined as an individual\u2019s cognitive and emotional bond to the natural world (Mayer and Frantz, 2004). Recent studies have suggested a positive association between connectedness to nature, perceived restoration (Berto et\u00a0 al., 2018; van den Bogerd et\u00a0 al., 2018) and preference for higher, possibly more naturalistic vegetation in urban settings (Lee et\u00a0 al., 2014). It is unclear, however, whether individuals with low connectedness to nature find non-natural settings (e.g., urban environments) restorative, as proposed by Berto et\u00a0 al. (2018). It may be\u00a0 that an individual perceives an environment to be\u00a0restorative when that environment has a biophilic quality that is compatible with that person\u2019s level of connectedness to nature (Berto et\u00a0 al., 2018). As the restorative potential of a setting varies from person to person (Hartig et\u00a0 al., 1997), perhaps for people with a weak connectedness to nature being presented with a less natural environment may allow them to experience higher perceived restoration (Berto et\u00a0al., 2018). Therefore, it would be\u00a0interesting to examine whether an urban environment has the potential to be\u00a0perceived as restorative among those with low connectedness to nature. Exploring the relation between connectedness to nature and perceived restorativeness would provide insight into whether the perceived restoration of natural and urban environments differ for individuals with varying degrees of connectedness to nature.\nAlthough water is present in studies investigating sustained attention and exposure to nature, little consideration has been given to the differential effect that water in landscapes or waterscapes may have had on sustained attention performance or perceived attention restoration. Behavioral evidence from studies using natural stimuli containing both vegetation and water showed restorative effects on sustained attention, attentional capacity, and the attention networks (Hartig et\u00a0al., 1991; Berto, 2005; Berman et\u00a0 al., 2008; Mayer et\u00a0 al., 2009; Craig et\u00a0 al., 2015). In contrast, Van den Berg et\u00a0 al. (2003) found that videos of water in natural and urban settings had no restorative benefit on sustained attention (Van den Berg et\u00a0 al., 2003). Only two studies have examined specifically the effects of water views on attention performance, with neither study finding water images to be\u00a0 more restorative than urban or greenery images (Emfield and Neider, 2014; Nguyen et\u00a0 al., 2018). These studies provide equivocal evidence of the restorative effects of water views on attention performance. In terms of perceived attention restoration, several researchers have found that both natural and urban scenes with water were associated with greater perceived restorative potential than those without water\n(V\u00f6lker and Kistemann, 1982; Purcell et\u00a0 al., 2001; Felsten, 2009; White et\u00a0 al., 2010; Grassini et\u00a0 al., 2019). White et\u00a0 al. (2010) found a dose\u2013response effect of water on perceived restorativeness, but water-only images were perceived as less restorative than mixed and greenery-only images (White et\u00a0 al., 2010). These findings conflict with work by Nielson and colleagues (2017), which showed no consistent pattern in the effect or proportion of water on perceived restorativeness and no evidence of difference in perceived restorativeness between water-only and greenery-only images (Nielson et\u00a0 al., 2018). Views of water alone may be\u00a0equivalent or possibly less restorative than views containing greenery.\nThis paper describes two studies that attempt to understand better the roles played by alertness and connection to nature in the interplay between sustained attention performance and exposure to nature. In Study 1, the differential effects of viewing images of meadow, water, and urban environments on sustained attention performance, alertness, and perceived restorativeness were measured. Study 2 was a modified and extended replication of Study 1 with a focus on the role of connectedness to nature on sustained attention performance and perceived restorativeness.\nStudy 1 Sustained attention performance is dependent upon an appropriate level of alertness (Aln\u00e6s et\u00a0 al., 2014). Exposure to nature may lead to an improvement in alertness from either low (Lee et\u00a0 al., 2015) or a high level (Ulrich et\u00a0 al., 1991). Lee et\u00a0 al. (2015) postulated that the maintenance of sustained attention control after viewing a flowery meadow roof image, compared with a degradation in performance following the viewing a concrete roof image, was due to nature gently stimulating one\u2019s level of alertness after becoming fatigued. Study 1 aimed to examine differential effects of viewing images of a meadow, an ocean, and an urban view on sustained attention performance, alertness, and perceived restoration. The procedure of Lee et\u00a0 al. (2015) was used, where participants completed the SART, then viewed an image for 40s that simulated a micro-break away from concentrating on the task, and then completed the SART again. Consistent with the literature showing the attentional benefits of exposure to green spaces, including Lee et\u00a0 al. (2015) and Schutte et\u00a0 al. (2017). Hypothesis 1 was that sustained attention performance would decline least for participants allocated the meadow image, moderately for those allocated the ocean image, and most for those allocated the urban image, as measured by SART performance. Hypothesis 2 predicted that alertness, as indexed by tonic pupil diameter, would decline least for the participants viewing the meadow image, moderately for those viewing the ocean image, and most for those viewing the urban image during the SART. In line with previous research on waterscapes (Nielson et\u00a0 al., 2018), Hypothesis 3 was that perceived restorativeness, as measured by scores on the Perceived Restorativeness Scale (Hartig et\u00a0 al., 1997), would be\u00a0 similar for the participants viewing the meadow and ocean images, and higher for those viewing the nature images than the urban image.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 809629\nFIGURE\u00a01 | The meadow image shown for 40 s between the baseline and post-intervention SARTs in Studies 1 and 2.\nFIGURE\u00a02 | The ocean image shown for 40 s between the baseline and post-intervention SARTs in Studies 1 and 2.\nStudy 1 Method"

During the baseline SART all three groups performed well and were able to maintain their performance across the two halves. The decline in mean tonic pupil diameter over the course of the baseline SART, however, suggested that all three groups were becoming less alert. During the post-intervention SART participants in all groups made more extremely long responses, as indicated by the tau measure, in the second half of the task. Tau is thought to index attentional lapses (Leth-Steensen et\u00a0 al., 2000). The measured increase in tau in the second half of the task is interpreted as evidence of an increase in attentional lapses, which may be\u00a0a consequence of cognitive fatigue. This finding was supported by evidence of physiological lowering of alertness, with the tonic pupil size diminishing across the course of the task, in all three groups. A time-on-task effect indicated by a diminishment of pupil size over the course of the task is consistent with the literature (Unsworth and Robison, 2016; Van den Brink et\u00a0 al., 2016). All three groups indicated an increase in sleepiness on the KSS from before the baseline SART and immediately after the post-intervention SART, and there was no effect of the image viewed on the KSS. Nevertheless, participants reported feeling more restored after viewing either nature image, particularly in terms of Being Away and Coherence, with no differences noted between the meadow and ocean groups. Previous research most often uses nature images with a combination of water and vegetation, and this combination is perceived as most restorative (White et\u00a0 al., 2010). Here, with the meadow and ocean clearly differentiated, both were perceived as equally restorative. There were no differences between the three images\nTABLE\u00a03 | Results from the Linear Mixed-Effects Models for Hypotheses 1 and 2 for Study 1.\nVariable F(df) F value p\nErrors of Commission Baseline SART Commission Error Performance F (1, 102) 52.75*** <0.001 Age F (1, 49) 2.98 0.091 Sex F (1, 49) 0.25 0.616 Group F (2, 48) 0.98 0.381 SART Half F (1, 51) 0.0001 0.993 Group x SART Half F (2, 51) 1.24 0.297 Mu Baseline SART Mu Performance F (1, 80) 108.11*** <0.001 Age F (1, 46) 3.59 0.064 Sex F (1, 46) 0.40 0.531 Group F (2, 47) 0.45 0.638 SART Half F (1, 49) 0.14 0.711 Group x SART Half F (2, 49) 0.18 0.835 Sigma Baseline SART Sigma Performance F (1, 127) 1.33 0.251 Age F (1, 55) 0.61 0.439 Sex F (1, 54) 0.04 0.840 Group F (2, 55) 0.94 0.396 SART Half F (1, 56) 0.0009 0.976 Group x SART Half F (2, 58) 0.22 0.802 Tau Baseline SART Tau Performance F (1, 96) 41.00*** <0.001 Age F (1, 58) 0.002 0.963 Sex F (1, 59) 0.47 0.498 Group F (2, 59) 0.86 0.430 SART Half F (1, 62) 4.56* 0.037 Group x SART Half F (2, 60) 0.53 0.589 Linear Change in Tonic Pupil Diameter Baseline SART Linear Change in Pupil Diameter F (1, 127) 18.32*** <0.001 Age F (1, 127) 1.08 0.301 Sex F (1, 127) 0.07 0.797 Group F (2, 127) 0.84 0.433 SART Half F (1, 127) 4.79* 0.030 Group x SART Half F (2, 127) 0.67 0.514 Mean Tonic Pupil Diameter Baseline SART Mean Pupil Diameter F (1, 70) 326.63*** <0.001 Age F (1, 59) 1.24 0.270 Sex F (1, 59) 1.36 0.248 Group F (2, 59) 0.24 0.785 SART Half F (1, 68) 4.44* 0.039 Group x SART Half F (2, 62) 0.65 0.527\ndf, degrees of freedom and SART Half, difference between the first and second half of the post-intervention SART. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 9 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 809629\nin terms of the fascination and compatibility sub-scales of the PRS. The urban image was a scene from a rooftop, which might afford a more expansive and evocative outlook. This image was modified in Study 2 to test this interpretation. These findings suggest performing two SARTs results in a fatiguing effect, and that while viewing the nature images did not provide physiological or behavioral benefits, providing no support for Hypotheses 1 and 2, participants noted a sense of restoration from the meadow and ocean images, supporting Hypothesis 3.\nStudy 2 Study 2 was a modified and extended replication of Study 1. First, eye-tracking was not performed because the study was conducted online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, a ground-level version of the urban stimulus was used to address limitations associated with inconsistent visual perspectives across the three images. In Study 1, the meadow and ocean images were taken at ground-level, whereas the urban image was taken from a rooftop. A high-level perspective, such as the urban view used in Study 1, affords greater perceptual and conceptual coherence (Slepian et\u00a0 al., 2015), and therefore greater extent. This may have increased perceived restorativeness and influenced the results relating to the urban view in Study 1. Third, the Connectedness to Nature Scale (CNS) was included to investigate if one\u2019s connectedness to nature was associated both with sustained attention performance and perceived restoration after viewing one of the three images. Beneficial effects of nature on sustained attention performance may depend on how much the participant felt connected to nature (Mayer and Frantz, 2004).\nKeeping the hypotheses similar between the two studies based on the previous literature, Hypothesis 1 was that sustained attention performance would decline least for the meadow group, moderately for the ocean group, and most for the urban group, as measured by SART performance. Hypothesis 2 was that perceived restorativeness would be\u00a0 similar for the meadow and ocean groups, and higher in the nature groups than in the urban group. Hypothesis 3 predicted that connectedness to nature would moderate the relation between the type of image\nviewed and both sustained attention performance and perceived restoration. Higher CNS scores in the meadow and ocean groups but lower CNS scores in the urban group were expected to predict better SART performance and higher PRS scores.\nStudy 2 Method"

During the baseline SART there was an increase in sigma for the urban group and in tau for the ocean group, but random allocation to the three groups was used and these slight group differences occurred before presentation of the image. Like Study 1, there was no effect of the image on SART performance, providing no support for Hypothesis 1. In this faster version, with each digit appearing every 1.15 s compared with 3.8 to 4.5 s in the eye-tracking SART, all participants performed the second half of the post-intervention SART with increased sigma rather than tau, as found in Study 1. Sigma is a measure of RT variability that indexes lapses in sustained attention\nTABLE\u00a05 | Descriptive statistics of each group for the SART variables for Study 2.\nVariable SART Half Meadow\nMedian (IQR)\nOcean\nMedian (IQR)\nUrban\nMedian (IQR)\nAll\nMedian (IQR)\nGroup difference statistics\nOmission Errors (count)\nBaseline First 0.0(2.0) 0.0(2.0) 0.0(2.0) 0.0(2.0) H(2) = 0.83, p\u00a0= 0.659 Second 1.0(3.0) 1.0(2.3) 0.0(2.0) 1.0(3.0) H(2) = 3.12, p\u00a0= 0.210 Post-intervention First 0.5(2.0) 0.5(2.0) 0.5(2.0) 0.5(2.0) Second 1.0(4.0) 1.0(3.0) 1.0(3.0) 1.0(3.8)\nCommission Errors (count) Baseline First 6.0(4.8) 6.0(4.0) 7.0(4.0) 6.0(4.0) H(2) = 0.50, p\u00a0= 0.780 Second 6.0(5.0) 6.0(5.0) 6.0(4.0) 6.0(5.0) H(2) = 0.26, p\u00a0= 0.878\nPost-intervention First 7.0(5.0) 7.0(4.3) 7.0(5.0) 7.0(5.0) Second 7.0(5.0) 7.0(5.0) 7.0(6.3) 7.0(5.0)\nMu (ms) Baseline First 264(77) 270(67) 264(57) 265(62) H(2) = 1.39, p\u00a0= 0.498 Second 255(100) 267(74) 269(64) 265(82) H(2) = 0.14, p\u00a0= 0.933\nPost-intervention First 264(116) 258(92) 256(78) 258(93) Second 274(128) 258(82) 259(105) 264(100)\nSigma (ms) Baseline First 45(28) 41(29) 36(20) 41(27) H(2) = 4.54, p\u00a0= 0.103 Second 49(33) 46(29) 46(22) 47(26) H(2) = 1.21, p\u00a0= 0.546\nPost-intervention First 54(39) 47(28) 47(24) 47(33) Second 57(47) 52(26) 56(30) 54(34)\nTau (ms) Baseline First 53(48) 49(41) 56(43) 53(45) H(2) = 2.25, p\u00a0= 0.325 Second 61(57) 56(51) 52(49) 56(51) H(2) = 3.88, p\u00a0= 0.144\nPost-intervention First 55(58) 55(70) 52(59) 53(62) Second 67(73) 71(68) 60(61) 65(68)\nThe post-intervention group differences were tested using the linear mixed models, reported in text.

This change is interpreted as a sign of attentional fatigue and was noted in all three groups. As in Study 1, the baseline SART may have caused small levels of attentional fatigue that only became manifest when completing the second, post-intervention SART.

Younger participants made more commission errors than older participants during the post-intervention SART. This observation may reflect better impulse control with age (Vallesi et\u00a0 al., 2021) and is consistent with research by Carriere et\u00a0 al. (2010) in which SART errors tended to decrease linearly with age (Carriere et\u00a0 al., 2010). No age effect was observed on the other SART variables.\nAs predicted and consistent with Study 1, the natural images were perceived as more restorative than the urban image, and the meadow and ocean images were rated as equally restorative, supporting Hypothesis 2. In contrast with Study 1, these results held true for all four subscales. This finding provides support for the speculation that the rooftop view offered by the urban image in Study 1 explained the lack of difference in fascination and compatibility between the three groups.\nHow connected one felt to nature was not associated with SART performance, irrespective of which image was viewed. Nevertheless, connectedness to nature did moderate the relation between viewing images of natural environments and how restorative the image was perceived. While high CNS scores predicted high PRS scores for the meadow and ocean groups, low CNS scores did not predict higher PRS scores for the urban group. The third hypothesis was partially supported. This finding is consistent with van den Bogerd et\u00a0 al. (2018), who found that individuals with a strong connectedness to nature rated green spaces as more restorative than individuals with low connectedness to nature (van den Bogerd et\u00a0 al., 2018). The finding runs against the idea that those with low connectedness to nature might have experienced higher restoration when presented with low biophilic environments,\nas proposed by Berto et al. (2018). Here, for participants with a weaker connectedness to nature, how restorative the image was perceived was not associated with the content of the image."

            "text": "Two recent meta-analyses suggested that the effects of nature exposure on sustained attention performance are small and the mechanisms underpinning this effect remain unclear (Ohly et\u00a0al., 2016; Stevenson et\u00a0 al., 2018). The present research aimed to examine if viewing images of vegetation, water, or an urban setting led to a change in alertness (Study 1) and behavioral performance on the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART; Studies 1 and 2), the perceived restorative value of that image (Studies 1 and 2), and the extent to which one\u2019s connection to nature played a role in both sustained attention performance and the perceived restoration of the viewed image (Study 2). There were three key findings. First, there was no difference in the pupillometry measures of alertness, sustained attention performance, or how sleepy participants felt after exposure to the meadow, ocean, or urban environment image. Second, both natural environments were perceived as being places with more restorative potential than the urban environment, with no difference found between the meadow and ocean views. Third, stronger connectedness to nature amplified the perceived restorativeness of the nature images, but not of the urban image; this effect was not noted in the behavioral performance on the SART. This differentiation between the physiological and behavioral findings compared with the perception of the restorative value of the\nFIGURE\u00a05 | The interaction between Connectedness to Nature Scale scores and group on the Perceived Restorativeness Scale scores, from Study 2. The grey shading represents the 95% confidence intervals.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 14 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 809629\nimages is novel. The findings provide new avenues for research on the mechanisms underpinning how nature exposure may operate to restore attention.\nLee et\u00a0al. (2015) speculated that the beneficial effects of viewing a flowering meadow image on sustained attention performance may have been due to gentle stimulation of alertness leading to enhanced attention control. Using an eye-tracker, the present research found that viewing nature images did not beneficially influence tonic pupil diameter, a measure of alertness. All three groups showed a decrease in linear change in tonic pupil diameter in the first half and a plateau in the second half of the postintervention SART, and a decrease in the mean pupil diameter from the first to second half of the post-intervention SART, both of which are suggestive of a decrease in alertness. Likewise, all three groups performed the SART with increased response time variability in the second half of the post-intervention SART (tau in Study 1, sigma in Study 2), suggestive of declining sustained attention. The reason why different forms of response time variability increased over the post-intervention task between the two studies is unclear but may be\u00a0 due to the timing differences of the two studies. In Study 1, the inter-trial interval varied between 3.8 and 4.5 s to enable enough time between trials for the pupil size to return to the tonic, baseline, level. In contrast, Study 2 excluded pupillometry and hence, used the standard Fixed SART with an inter-trial interval of 1.15 s. The longer inter-trial interval in Study 1 may have induced more attention lapses, as indexed by more very slow responses measured using tau. The shorter inter-trial interval in Study 2 may have induced more moment-to-moment variability in responding, as indexed by sigma. Using a psychomotor vigilance task, Unsworth and colleagues reported that with a long inter-stimulus interval of 8 compared with 2 s, or with a variable interval, participants performed the task with slower responses and with smaller tonic pupil diameter, suggesting that lapses of attention are associated with lower alertness levels (Unsworth et\u00a0al., 2018). In both studies all three groups reported an increase in sleepiness, measured using the KSS, following completion of the two SARTs. The pupillometry data, together with the behavioral data from the SART, and the KSS measure, suggest that participants were becoming less attentive and alert over the course of the two SARTs. The SART is a deliberately fatiguing task; a cumulative effect of performing the SART twice may have occurred. To date this is the first study to use pupillometry during a sustained attention task to test the immediate effects of viewing a nature image. The three other studies using pupillometry measured pupil diameter as participants viewed photos of different forms of nature, finding opposite effects (Nordh et\u00a0 al., 2010; Mart\u00ednez-Soto et\u00a0 al., 2019; Marois et\u00a0al., 2021). Here, the participants showed physiological and behavioral evidence of fatigue during both the baseline and post-intervention SARTs, and reported feeling sleepier after completing both SARTs, but with no relief proffered by viewing the nature images for the 40 s period tested here.\nRegarding performance on the SART, the results from both Studies One and Two suggested that exposure to the images of nature did not influence sustained attention performance. This finding conflicts with similar research that found exposure to natural images compared with urban images led to faster response times (Berto, 2005), less response time variability\nand fewer omission errors (Lee et\u00a0 al., 2015; Cassarino et\u00a0 al., 2019). This finding is consistent, however, with Berto\u2019s research in study 3 (Berto, 2005), which found no significant difference between viewing natural or urban images on any SART outcome measures, and Lee et\u00a0 al. (2015) who reported no difference between groups on mean response time and commission errors. It is also congruent with work by Nguyen et\u00a0 al. (2018), who failed to observe any restorative effect of nature images containing varying proportions of water and greenery (Nguyen et\u00a0 al., 2018), and Cassarino, Maisto, and colleagues (2019), who observed no differences when comparing SART performance after a simulated drive in a computerized rural or urban road environment (Cassarino et\u00a0al., 2019). Together the pupil diameter and SART performance findings suggest that the mechanisms underpinning attention restoration associated with exposure to nature, using a 40 s view of a static image, are not related to alertness or cognitive functioning.\nThe findings from both studies strongly suggest that although the participants did not show physical or cognitive evidence of benefit after viewing the meadow or ocean images, they perceived the meadow and ocean images as places where they could feel restored. Indeed, the data from Study 2 indicated that one\u2019s perception of restoration was tightly linked to how connected one felt to nature, as proposed by Mayer and Frantz (Mayer and Frantz, 2004). Connectedness to nature was found to moderate the relation between viewing images of natural environments and perceived restorativeness of the places in Study 2. Participants with high connectedness to nature were more likely to rate the nature images as more restorative than those with low connectedness to nature, while how connected to nature one felt was irrelevant to the restorative value of the urban image. The rooftop urban image provided some minor restorative benefits compared with the ground level urban image, with no group differences noted between the perceived restoration of the meadow, ocean, and rooftop urban images in terms of Fascination and Compatibility. The ground urban image, in contrast, did not afford such perceived benefits, with the meadow and ocean images rated as more restorative on all four subscales of the Perceived Restoration Scale. Connectedness to nature is an important moderator of perceived restorativeness of nature images. This finding highlights the important role that positive feelings and emotion play in nature-based restoration, echoing the argument put forth by colleagues that affective responses to the natural scene may explain some of the restorative value of nature (Craig et\u00a0al., 2015; Mart\u00ednez-Soto et\u00a0al., 2019). This is an important future line of research for understanding the mechanisms associated with the Attention Restoration Theory.\nIn these two studies, the images presented to the participants were static photos. The Stevenson et\u00a0 al. (2018) meta-analysis encouraged the use of actual exposure to natural environments over the use of virtual exposure (Stevenson et\u00a0 al., 2018), especially in studies measuring sustained attention and vigilance. Here, a choice was made to use static images because of the use of the lab-based eye-tracker. An improvement in design in future research would include the use of mobile eye-tracking and actual exposure to different environments. Future research might also consider extending the length of duration of exposure to the different environments, as Stevenson\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 15 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 809629\net\u00a0al. (2018) argued that longer exposure may be\u00a0moderating the restorative effect of natural environments compared with control conditions. Another limitation of the two studies is that confounds associated with color, shape, shade, familiarity with the image, associations with leisure and work, heat, relaxation, and stress were not addressed. These factors could be\u00a0 systematically address in future research. One limitation specific to Study 2 was that the experimenters did not have control over where the participants looked when they were instructed to view the image for 40s, as the study was conducted online due to restrictions associated with COVID19. Future research might consider broadening the concept of connection to nature to measure feelings, thoughts, and experiences people might have with nature separately, possibly through the use of the Nature Relatedness Questionnaire (Nisbet et\u00a0 al., 2008). These limitations and confounds may help explain why there were no physiological or behavioral differences measured between the three groups.\nHere, with the use of a well-established neuropsychological test of sustained attention, alertness measured using an eye-tracker with a high sampling rate, the current best measurement of response time with the use of the Ex-Gaussian model, and a replication of the behavioral results from Study 1\u00a0 in Study 2, no benefits of viewing the nature images over the urban image were measured physiologically or behaviorally. How connected one felt to nature had a strong effect on how restorative the meadow and ocean images, but not the urban image, were rated. This finding highlighted the importance of emotional response to nature, familiarity with nature, and the perspective of self within the world."
