A fim de testar o efeito de media\u00e7\u00e3o, o estudo utiliza dados recolhidos de estudantes universit\u00e1rios do Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey, no M\u00e9xico. O inqu\u00e9rito produziu 95 dados utiliz\u00e1veis de um total de 97. Os resultados v\u00e1lidos foram testados por meio da abordagem de media\u00e7\u00e3o do modelo linear generalizado (GLM). Os resultados emp\u00edricos do m\u00e9todo Delta afirmam (estimativa = 0,4445, \u03b2 = 0,474, z = 3,699, p < .001) o papel de confian\u00e7a no governo como mediador entre a percep\u00e7\u00e3o dos estudantes sobre o risco de sa\u00fade da COVID-19 e sua satisfa\u00e7\u00e3o de vida. Em outras palavras, para os estudantes de gradua\u00e7\u00e3o mexicanos a confian\u00e7a no governo desempenha papel crucial como mediador entre suas percep\u00e7\u00f5es sobre o risco de sa\u00fade do coronav\u00edrus e a satisfa\u00e7\u00e3o de vida. As conclus\u00f5es do estudo podem orientar os esfor\u00e7os dos governos na elabora\u00e7\u00e3o de pol\u00edticas e motiv\u00e1-los a apoiar iniciativas de cria\u00e7\u00e3o de confian\u00e7a.

In order to test the mediation effect, this study utilizes data collected from undergraduate students at Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey in Mexico by means of online survey. The survey yielded 95 usable data out of 97. The valid results were tested via generalized linear model (GLM) Mediation approach for the mediation. Empirical findings of Delta method affirm the mediation (estimate = 0.4445, \u03b2 = 0.474, z = 3.699, p < .001) role of trust in government as a mediator between students\u2019 perception of COVID-19 health risk and their life satisfaction. In other words, Mexican undergraduate students are of the view that trusting government plays a crucial role as a mediator between their perception of coronavirus health risk and life satisfaction. These findings may guide the governments\u2019 policy making efforts and motivate them to support their initiatives with trust-building efforts.",

A fim de testar o efeito de media\u00e7\u00e3o, o estudo utiliza dados recolhidos de estudantes universit\u00e1rios do Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey, no M\u00e9xico. O inqu\u00e9rito produziu 95 dados utiliz\u00e1veis de um total de 97. Os resultados v\u00e1lidos foram testados por meio da abordagem de media\u00e7\u00e3o do modelo linear generalizado (GLM). Os resultados emp\u00edricos do m\u00e9todo Delta afirmam (estimativa = 0,4445, \u03b2 = 0,474, z = 3,699, p < .001) o papel de confian\u00e7a no governo como mediador entre a percep\u00e7\u00e3o dos estudantes sobre o risco de sa\u00fade da COVID-19 e sua satisfa\u00e7\u00e3o de vida.

            "text": "Since the first coronavirus cases started, governments have been trying to mitigate the effects of the outbreak. While some regimes follow strict restrictions and implement isolation measures, others prefer to use alternative methods like smart lockdowns and socio-economic programs following the medical advisory boards\u2019 recommendations and international organizations such as World Health Organization1,2. Despite these efforts, the success of preventative measures highly depends on how societies perceive fairness of policy making, trust in institutions, perceived health risk, and consequences of these initiatives in their life satisfaction. If citizens of a country trust the reasoning behind policy implementations, they postulate them as improvement in their health safety and overall life satisfaction3.\nOn the contrary, if stringent policy making couples with public distrust in a government, the citizens of countries may consider government interventions as hostile4. This leads to a negative impact on perception of life satisfaction and increase the magnitude of the public distrust in government even further5. For instance, studies conducted after H1N1 pandemic at Switzerland illustrate that initially Swiss population displayed high trust on the government legislations; however, the trust level sharply declined over the time due to the discrepancies between promised effects by government and end result of the implemented policies6,7. A systematic literature review conducted on H1N1 reports that In most countries, perceived vulnerability increased, but perceived severity, anxiety, self-efficacy, and vaccination intention decreased8. This highlights that there is a strong link between trust in government policies and life satisfaction.\nAnother critical aspect of crisis management is the magnitude of perceived health risk. How people assert their risk perception can affect their trust in and content with institutions and governments9. The behavioral response to the crisis is linked to the perception of risk related to the adverse impact of that specific crisis. In times of major disasters and health crisis, people tend to accept higher degree of restrictive policy implementations while, if the risk perception is low, the vice-a-versa is valid10,11. Thus, it is essential to investigate the trust in government dealings and the perceived risk among citizens during a health crisis.\nWith the emergence of COVID-19, there is a growing body of literature that addresses the\naforementioned relationship. Although initial studies report that there is a correlation between trust in government departments and agencies and government policies12,13, majority of these studies are focused on advanced country settings and investigate the topic through the general public lenses. So far, there is limited numbers of studies that concerning of a particular group of population and how aforementioned dynamics work within that group. For instance, Lambovska et al.14 mention in their recent study that the rate of unemployment among European Union (EU) member countries\u2019 young population (25 years of age or younger) have gone up due to adverse effects of COVID-19. Similarly, Palmer and Small15 indicate that COVID-19 has further burdened youth (age 18 to 29) in terms of their economic responsibilities and healthcare related expenditures. Both studies further highlight the importance of government policy implementations for protection of the young population, since they are accounting for nearly one fourth of the total world\u2019s population.\nMotivated to contribute to the mentioned literature gaps, this study aims to investigate university student\u2019s perception on how government policies affect their life satisfaction associated with perceived coronavirus health risk in Mexico. The reason why students are chosen is due to lack of studies that targets them as a subset of young generations. Also, it is important to highlight that Mexico is the only emerging market country in the North America region. Therefore, students who are in Mexico provides a unique setting for this study."

            "text": "Perceived coronavirus health risk and life satisfaction\nLife satisfaction of an individual is determined by the perception of their environment and intuitive risk assessment within that environment16,17. Based on their risk perceptions, individuals adjust their behavior in such a way that they can avoid potential adverse effects of risk factors and can increase their perceived life satisfaction18. While this dynamic is thought to be executed based on facts as well as rational deliberations19, social-cognition literature reveals that being exposed to misinformation (optimistic or pessimistic) that is closer to an individual\u2019s own belief or solely relying on one\u2019s own observa-\n2997 C\ni\u00ean cia & Sa\u00fa de C oletiva, 27(8):2995-3004, 2022\ntion can sway the ability to assess the risk20-22. A given group of people, as a result of the subjectivity, may perceive their life satisfaction higher or lower than other groups in the given society when facing the same adverse situation23. Literature provides mixed results regarding this issue. In some cases, there may not even be a perceived risk at a given health crisis; therefore, no change in terms of life satisfaction can possibly be observed24. Based on the above discussion, this study proposes the following hypothesis \u2013 H\n1 :\nStudents\u2019 perceived coronavirus health risk affects their perception of life satisfaction.\nPerceived coronavirus health risk and trust in government policies\nRecent published research in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization highlights that one of the main influencers of risk perception during COVID-19 crisis is the public relations and trust in government25. This is due to citizens of countries\u2019 dependance on reliable information dissemination on the current events, health system\u2019s effectiveness, and the potential nationwide action plans26. Failing to answer these needs and delaying taking action to curb the negativities born due to COVID-19 for the sake of political narratives increases the distrust in institutions, legislations, and overall government dealings17,27-29.\nOn the other hand, there are research works indicating that government\u2019s ability to match with public\u2019s opinion on how severe the crisis is and to implement measures that could counterbalance the negativities of COVID-19 boost the public trust towards government policies30,31. As a result, the perceived health risk decreases and citizens\u2019 attitude towards risk level at a given country drops and they go back to their pre-pandemic daily routines32,33.\nThe emerging research, however, reveals a different path of interaction. It suggests that the higher risk perception of health could mean lower levels of trust in the government policies34,35. Simply, the higher potential of the riskiness could be perceived by the citizens as ineffective policy making. The higher perceived risk, therefore, requires more impactful government policymaking to recover trust in government policies36. Similarly, false claims by the unaccountable news outlets and word of mouth could create higher perception of risk and lower the level of trust in government37. False information and distorted claims by plethora of news mediums could fuel\nthe overestimate of the seriousness of the pandemic while fostering conspiracy theories to reduce trust in government and policy-making process in a given country38. Based on the above discussion, this study proposes the following hypothesis \u2013 H\n2 : Perceived coronavirus health risk\naffects students\u2019 trust in government policies.\nTrust in government policies and life satisfaction\nTrust in government and its influence on the life satisfaction level has been long investigated in social sciences. Frey and Stutzer39, in their seminal work, highlight that there is a strong evidence on the influence of government policies over life satisfaction. Their contemporaries also provide supporting evidence that government policies directly impact life dynamics at a given country and society40,41. In alignment with the literature, Yu et al.42 find that government policies that are reducing factors of stress in citizens\u2019 livelihood and increasing convenience of their daily dealings would lead to higher life satisfaction compared to antecedent life satisfaction levels. In a similar fashion, Barrafrem et al.43 highlight that trust in government policies causes reduction of future anxiety and improves life satisfaction among citizens.\nYet, the impact of the government policies and to what they are welcomed by the citizens in terms of their life satisfaction is significantly related to citizens\u2019 trust in government44. The lower trust in the policy makers would cause negative perception that leads to lower level of life satisfaction45. On the contrary, however, high trust in policymakers does not always translate into ex-ante policymaking life satisfaction perception of citizens36. Due to the dynamic relationship between trust in government policies and life satisfaction, each group and society should be treated as a unique set of observation and investigated separately27,46,47. Based on above discussion, this study proposes the following hypothesis \u2013 H\n3 :\nTrust in government policies affects life satisfaction of students.\nMediating effects of trust in government policies between perception of health risk and life satisfaction\nWhen large numbers of actors are involved in taking a government motivated action, the extent that individuals\u2019 sense making directly correlated with their own social welfare rather\n2998 A bb as A e t a l.\nthan societies overall well-being48. If individuals\u2019 cost-benefit calculation reveals the perceived risk is not high enough to follow the policies in the time of an adverse event and they do not trust the government, they simply prefer not to follow preventative guidelines and policies that the government implements49. Their perception towards government interventions shifts from facilitating structure for daily life to hindrance of their livelihood50,51. As a result, publics\u2019 perception on trust in government policies and life satisfaction plummets.\nOn the contrary, in certain high-risk environments, government interventions may be considered as legitimate. For instance, if a government provides sound reasoning behind its interventions during the crisis, it will build trust among citizens towards implementing policies and reduce the perceived riskiness52-55. Otherwise, government interventions will be linked to corruption and reduce trust in government during crisis56,57. However, there is a limited number of research works that investigates the dynamic mentioned above in COVID-19 settings. It is not clear whether trust in government policies mediate how citizens perceive government actions and link it to their life satisfaction. Hence, based on the provided literature, this paper proposes the following hypothesis \u2013 H\n4 : Trust in government\nmediates the relationship between perceived coronavirus health risk perception and life satisfaction among students.\nThe Figure 1 illustrates the model that is created to investigate and plot the relationship among the \u201cPerceived Coronavirus Health Risk\u201d (PCHR), \u201cTrust in Government Policies\u201d (TGP), and life satisfaction (LS). It accounts for two possible relation investigations among the mentioned variables: direct relation/correlations and mediation-based interactions. The rigor of the model stems from its way of mapping each possible interaction through the lenses of the proposed mediation technique. The next section explains the adopted methodology in detail, followed by the \u201cAnalysis and Results\u201d section in which the analysis results are explained thoroughly."

            "text": "Participants and procedure\nThis research has been conducted using empirical evidence which was collected through online responses of undergraduate students of\nTecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey, Mexico. In order to collect data for this research, we sought help from university Professors for distributing Google form-based online survey links among their students. Professors used a learning management system (LMS) platform, Canvas, to distribute this online survey link. Canvas is currently being utilized as an official LMS platform for both university professors and students. For this research, the data was collected using the convenience sampling technique. The data collection duration was based on the following five weeks, starting from April to the first week of May 2021. Due to the anonymity of the survey, with in alignment with the previous studies, the study is exempt from ethical board approval58.\nWithin the scope of this study, we received a total of 97 responses via Google Form-based online survey. During data curation, it was found that two responses were incomplete, which were deleted prior to the final analysis of collected data. Therefore, we could only take into account 95 responses as the final analysis of collected data.\nMeasures\nIndependent variable: perceived coronavirus health risk To measure perceived coronavirus health risk (PCHR), we adopted three items from scale developed by Han et al.59 The sample questions involved To minimize my chances of getting coronavirus, I wash my hands more often. In order to test the reliability of the scale, Cronbach alpha value was utilized. According to the previous literature, the value of Cronbach alpha values that are exceeding the 0.7 value accepted as reliable scale for the measuring variables60,61. Cronbach alpha, for the independent variable (PCHR) found as 0.94. The test shows that PCHR variable that is employed for this study is reliability.\nMediating variable: trust in government policies To measure trust in government policies (TGP), three items had been adopted from the developed scale of Han et al.59 The sample questions entailed In general, how much do you trust government of your country to take the right measures to deal with the coronavirus pandemic\u201d. The reliability and the scale of the variable is validated based on Cronbach alpha test. The value of Cronbach alpha for the variable is determined as 0.91. It shows that the scale to be reliable for the present study60,62,63.\nSource: Authors.\nDependent variable: life satisfaction To measure life satisfaction (LS), we adopted four items from developed scales of Phulkerd et al.64 The sample questions included In most ways, my life is close to my ideal and the reliability determined as 0.80. This finding agrees with the Xiong et al.62\nStatistical analysis\nIn order to statistically analyze collected data, we used Jamovi version 1.6.23.0 (Mac OS), an open-access software. During the first step of data analysis, we applied a descriptive technique for gaining initial information of participants like the total number of respondents and percentage with regards to their gender, age, major, enrollment status, and scholarship. In the second step, we applied correlation analysis for checking the existence of a correlation between a set of variables. Lastly, we applied the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) mediation approach, to identify the mediation (indirect and direct) effects of Trust on government policies on the independent variable Perceived coronavirus health risk and dependent variable i.e., Life satisfaction, and also total effects between both dependent and independent variable."

Age-wise distribution of respondents was 26 students (27.4%) between 18 to 20 years, 62 respondents (65.3%) between 21 to 22 years, and remaining 7 respondents were above 23 years (7.4%). Most responses were received from male students i.e., 64 (67.4%), and the remaining 31 were female respondents (32.6%). Specialization-wise 58 (61.1%) respondents were from Management and Social Sciences, 31 (32.6%) respondents from Engineering, and remaining 6 from Natural Sciences (6.3%). 55 (57.9%) respondents were studying without a scholarship, and the remaining 40 (42.1%) respondents held scholarships (Table 1).\nCorrelation analysis\nFor correlation analysis, we applied Pearson\u2019s r test to explore the correlation existing among independent (PCHR), mediation (TGP), and dependent (LS) variables. It is demonstrated by analyzed results in Table 1 that a significant correlation exists between sets of variables. PCHR is significantly and positively correlated with LS (r = .474, p < 0.001). Analyzed results also confirm that a significantly positive correlation exists between PCHR and TGP (r = .877, p < 0.001), and TGP and LS (r = .569, p < 0.001) (Table 2).\nHypotheses testing\nGLM Mediation analysis technique was used to test the hypotheses based on relationships represented in the research model. The technique was used by employing the \u201cmedmod\u201d module\n3000 A bb as A e t a l.\nof Jamovi software. Table 3 illustrates the findings of our results. It is indicated by the analyzed result that our first hypothesis H\n1 : Students\u2019 per-\nceived coronavirus health risk affects their perception of life satisfaction is supported (\u03b2 = 0.474,\np < 0.001). H 2 : Perceived coronavirus health risk affects students\u2019 trust in government policies (\u03b2 = 0.887, p < 0.001) and H\n3 : Trust in government pol-\nicies affects life satisfaction of students (\u03b2 = 0.662, p < 0.001) are supported respectively.\nIt is also revealed by Table 3 that trust in government policies mediates the relationship between PCHR and LS because no zero value exists between Lower and Upper Confidence Intervals, also the Delta method affirms mediation (estimate = 0.4445, \u03b2 = 0.474, z = 3.699, p < .001). Hence, hypothesis H\n4 has been supported as well\ni.e., Trust in government mediates the relationship between coronavirus health risk perception and life satisfaction among students. After the mediator\u2019s introduction, the relationship between the dependent and independent variable has been modified from significant to insignificant such as significant total effects were modified insignificant direct effects. It has been affirmed through our analyzed results that the research model has full mediation."

            "text": "According to the previous literature, mixed results of government efforts in mitigating the negative effects of public health crises might be due to the varying levels of societies\u2019 trust in governments3,4. While high public trust in government significantly increases the compliance with restrictions and preventative measures65, distrust in government limits the outcomes of the of government responses to COVID-1966.\nThis study demonstrates a correlation between perceived coronavirus health risk and life satisfaction, perceived coronavirus health risk and trust in government policies, as well as trust in government policies and life satisfaction. This analysis supports the argument that trust in gov-\n3001 C\ni\u00ean cia & Sa\u00fa de C oletiva, 27(8):2995-3004, 2022 ernment policies has a mediation effect on the relation between people\u2019s perception of health risk and their life satisfaction. The data confirms that trust in government policies is a mediating variable, accounting for the relationship between the perception of COVID-19 health risk among the students who took the survey and their life satisfaction.\nFurthermore, the perceived coronavirus health risk is correlated with trust in government\u2019s policies. In line with the hypothesis, the results show that the students\u2019 perceived health risk associated with the coronavirus affects their level of trust in government policies. Our results support the findings of the contemporary research such as Edelman67 which shows a record rise in trust in government among the 11 studied countries during the COVID -19 pandemic. Our study agrees with the previous literature that the potential riskiness of a health crisis would influence the perception of citizens about effectiveness of government\u2019s policy making and implementation10,11,32,68. The findings of this study also emphasize the importance of ethical media and transparency of information. As Kim and Kim37, and Melki et al.38 suggested, false claims and distorted information by unaccountable news mediums could alter the perception of risk and affect the trust in the government and their policy-making process.\nHowever, according to our results, the extent that the government policies are welcomed by the citizens in terms of their life satisfaction is related to people\u2019s trust in government. This is in line with the statement of Hetherington and Husser3, and Barrafrem et al.43 that if citizens trust the reasoning behind policy implementations by government, they consider them as improvement in their health safety and life satisfaction.\nFinally, results further supplement the perspective on the relevance of trust in government policies as a mediator variable between perceived coronavirus health risk and life satisfaction. After the introduction of trust in government policies, the relationship between the perceived coronavirus health risk and life satisfaction was modified from significant to insignificant. Therefore, trust in government policies fully mediates the effect of perceived health risk on life satisfaction."

            "text": "Recently, perceived coronavirus health risk presented a unique challenge for all governments. In order to tackle this challenging situation, the governments must design and execute new innovative public policies for citizens to trust their government policies as well as build life satisfaction. Due to the dynamic relationship shared by the trust in government policies and life satisfaction, every group and society must be investigated separately and treated as a unique set of observations25,44,45. It has been affirmed through this study\u2019s findings that Mexican undergraduate students are of the view that trusting government plays a crucial role as a mediator between their perception of coronavirus health risk and life satisfaction. The relevant findings of the study might provide guidance to governments\u2019 policymaking efforts and encourage them to support their initiatives with trust-building efforts. In addition, practitioners and academics alike may further explore what communication strategies would transmit information in a reliable fashion and efficient way as a future research topic through comparative analysis and diverse country settings."
