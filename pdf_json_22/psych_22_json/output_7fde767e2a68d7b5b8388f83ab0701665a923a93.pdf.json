    "abstractText": "Mental health refers to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional well-being. However, significant research gaps are still found in disclosing the disparities in mental health outcomes between heterosexual and sexual minority (SM) individuals during the period of 20\u201324 years of age. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the association between the prevalence of psychoactive substance use and the severity of anxiety or depressive symptoms, and well-being across SM and non-SM student-aged populations (N = 1330). This cross-sectional study was conducted in Lithuania over the period of fifteen months following the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study concentrated on the mental health symptomatology, well-being status, and the prevalence of the psychoactive substance use, which were measured by three screening instruments. In terms of negative well-being, mental health problems, and health-risk behaviors, it was found that the SMs were potentially more exposed than the non-SMs. The current study also revealed a significant impact of substance use (alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking) on the symptoms of anxiety (adjusted odds ratios (AOR) 1.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0\u20132.6), AOR 1.5 (95% CI: 1.0\u20132.2)), and negative well-being (AOR 1.7 (95% CI: 1.0\u20132.8), AOR 1.7 (95% CI: 1.1\u20132.5)) across the SM student-aged group. The association between the increased self-administration of cannabis and positive mental health outcomes appertained to milder anxiety symptoms amid SMs has been identified (AOR 0.5 (95% CI: 0.2\u20130.9)). Given that minority stressors could play an important part in mediating between the sexual orientation and negative outcomes of mental and behavioral health in student-aged populations, health strategies should focus on the development of effective substance abuse and drug prevention programs, both student-centered and SMs-centered, aimed to reduce health-risk behaviors in emerging adulthood.",

            "text": "From a holistic point of view, mental health refers to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional well-being [1]. However, mental disorders worldwide were related to 32% of the disability year, including 13% of disability-adjusted life years [2]. In addition, individuals suffering from mental disorders were more likely to develop a risk for morbidity triggered by general medical conditions [3\u20135] associated with premature mortality [6]. A new stage of individual development that has a potential impact on a person\u2019s mental health has been identified as emerging adulthood delineating adolescents and young adults between 18 and 29 years of age [7]. As long as the most common potential risk factor for the development of mental issues is described as a younger age associated with the instability of life structure, changes in lifestyle and place of residence, economic hardships, or worries about postacademic life [8,9], the target population in many of the research studies was attributed to\nSustainability 2022, 14, 13063. https://doi.org/10.3390/su142013063 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability 2022, 14, 13063 2 of 16\nstudent-aged populations at risk of developing the symptoms of a higher level of severity of mental disorders [10\u201318]. Taking into account that students at the age of emerging adulthood face extensive demands in higher education schools leading to elevated psychosocial distress that tends to result in negative mental health outcomes [19], significant gaps remain to be filled by carrying out the research into the disparities of mental health outcomes between heterosexual and sexual minority (SM) individuals [20]. More specifically, multiple studies have revealed the disparities in mental health outcomes observed between heterosexual and SM individuals in accordance with the minority stress model [21\u201328], which defines psychological distress mediated by both internalized (i.e., internalized heterosexism) as well as external (i.e., discrimination, harassment, rejection by the family of origin) stressors [21,29]. Several studies have documented that individuals identifying themselves as a SM (bisexual, lesbian, gay, and transgender) reported higher levels of perceived psychological stress [30\u201333] along with negative outcomes related to severe symptoms of depression and anxiety or other mental disorders, when compared to heterosexual subjects [25,34\u201340]. Another promising theory is related to the mindsponge mechanism. The mindsponge mechanism suggests that a person\u2019s thinking and behaviors are influenced by his/her set of core values [41]. SMs tend to have different value systems from heterosexual people, so their thinking and behaviors are also different. However, if SM persons behave differently from heterosexual people in a social setting, they are more likely to face discrimination, verbal and physical assault, and other forms of harassment. Otherwise, SM people have to try to behave like other heterosexual people, preventing them from being their true selves. Such conflicting mental processes might result in anxiety (an emotion used by apprehension and the somatic symptoms of tension in which an individual anticipates impending danger, catastrophe, or misfortune) and depression (a negative affective state, ranging from unhappiness and discontent to an extreme feeling of sadness, pessimism, and despondency, that interferes with one\u2019s daily life). In addition, the SM people feel anxious because of their survival desire in society, while depression results from their prolonged anxiety [42]. The sexual-orientation-related differences could lead not only to negative health outcomes but also to a higher prevalence of psychoactive substances use [43\u201345]. Based on data derived from some studies, SMs were two times more likely to suffer from mental disorders [46] and two to five times more likely to have substance-use disorders [47] compared to heterosexual individuals. Negative health behaviors, namely, higher rates of tobacco [48], alcohol [49], and drugs [50] use were also associated with negative health outcomes in the cohorts of SMs. Considering the fact that SMs in emerging adulthood are especially exposed to the situations with a risk of development of both mental disorders [25,34\u201340] and higher levels of psychoactive substances use [48\u201350], the gap in studies that have revealed specific differences across student-aged populations still relates to a shortage classifying individuals into sexual orientation categories, such as heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual. The problem also exists in studies examining the condition of mental well-being in relation to psychoactive substance use among individuals who differ in sexual orientations. Importantly, if there are developmental differences in the onset and prevalence of mental health conditions, scholars [43\u201352] who have accumulated data across broad age ranges between 18 and 65 years may be underestimating the level of risk for negative health outcomes along with behavioral patterns in a sample of SM emerging adulthood individuals. Meanwhile, Lithuania has not made any progress yet in improving the situation of its LGBTQ+ people, ranking 34th among 49 countries in the latest edition of the ILGA-Europe Rainbow Europe Map and Index, which monitors queer rights across the continent [53]. Thus, this article examined the following research questions (RQ):\nRQ1. To what degree do disparities exist in the proportions of case-level symptoms of mental disorders and negative well-being status in the samples of SMs vs. non-SMs?\nSustainability 2022, 14, 13063 3 of 16\nRQ2. To what extent do disparities exist in the rate of psychoactive substance use across the cohorts of SMs and non-SMs?\nRQ3. Does psychoactive substance use have an association with mental health problems (the severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms) and well-being status in the samples of SMs vs. non-SMs?"

According to Kelsey\u2019s formula [55], the representative sample size was 714\u20131125 cases of the student-aged population, considering a 4% (z-score 1.96) margin of error, a 95% two-sided confidence interval (CI) was calculated. A total of 125,200 students of eligible population were selected from two major cities in Lithuania, namely, Vilnius and Kaunas, from September to November 2021. The simple random sampling was used to recruit the students from higher education institutions. Participants were recruited through the social media Facebook platform (the official 70 Facebook groups) in Lithuania. All Facebook groups were administrated by 21 higher education institutions in Lithuania. The questionnaire was designed as an online survey, and the web-based E-survey research application was applied to gather information (https://apklausa.lt/private/forms/ (accessed on 2 September 2021)). Depending on the website administration and social media moderation, a link to this survey was periodically submitted and updated in different Facebook groups of universities and colleges. The participation in the survey was provided to 125,200 student-aged individuals. If the students read the instruction detailing the current investigation and had an interest in participating in the survey, then they were sent a link to the website with an online questionnaire. In total, 1426 participants responded to the survey (the response rate in this research was 1.14%). Thus, 123,480 subjects were excluded from the study by reason of deficient entry criteria (without gender identity and/or treated psychiatrically) or declined to fill in the questionnaires. Finally, 18 foreign participants were excluded on the basis of their nationality, as the study was focused only on the Lithuanian students.

A vali ated Lithuanian version of HADS [57] was administered. This instrument was widely used for research purposes in Lithuania [58,59].

HADS questionnaire includes seven issues on each of the symptoms of mental health disorders, and each response consists of a four-point rating scale (scores range from 0 to 3). Sum scores for HADS subscales may range between 0 and 21. A score of 7 or less indicates asymptomatic anxiety or depression, a score between 8 and 10 points indicates borderline symptomatology of anxiety or depression, and a score of 11 and above stipulates that the symptoms of anxiety or depression may potentially point out a case of mental health disorder [59].\n2.2.2. Well-Being\nThe incidence of various health complaints is an important indicator of the physical and psycho-emotional health of young people [60]. To evaluate the well-being index of students, the following questionnaire constructed by the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences (LSMU) was employed [61]. While conducting the study, the information was collected regarding the participants\u2019 symptoms and signs related to health concerns. Subjects were asked to indicate on a five-point Likert-type scale (from \u201cvery often\u201d (1 score) to \u201cnever\u201d (5 scores)) how often they had experienced 26 health-related symptoms that occurred over the last 12 months. According to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) classification system, the symptoms and signs were classified into those that involve the cognition, perception, e otional state, and behavior; the respiratory system; the digestive system and abdomen; general sensations and perceptions; the circulatory system; the nervous and musculoskeletal systems [62]. The well-being index was calculated based on the frequency of self-reported symptoms by summing up the response scores [63]. The estimates of the well-being index ranged from 27 to 108 scores. The interpretation of the results assumed that higher well-being\nSustainability 2022, 14, 13063 5 of 16\nscores reflected a positive well-being status while lower ones showed a negative state of well-being. In a further analysis, according to the 50th percentile, the total well-being scores were assigned to two groups, namely, the students with a negative well-being status (27\u201381 score) and the students with a positive well-being status (82\u2013108 score). Additionally, as it was established in the previous study, the measure of Cronbach\u2019s alpha was equal to 0.846, and it was also related to a good internal consistency of this well-being scale [61].\n2.2.3. The Prevalence of the Psychoactive Substance Use\nTo assess the prevalence and the patterns of the psychoactive substance use, a survey of 3 semi-open questions was designed to reveal the frequency of alcohol, tobacco, and drug use over the last 12 months (with response options of \u201cnever\u201d, \u201c2\u20133 times a month\u201d, \u201c2\u20136 times a week\u201d, or \u201conce a day or frequently\u201d). Additionally, respondents were asked to indicate the types of drugs that have been self-administered and report the frequency of use of these drugs over the last 12 months. Psychotropic substances reported by respondents were classified into \u201ccannabis (marijuana)\u201d, \u201camphetamines\u201d, \u201cMDMA (ecstasy)\u201d, \u201cLSD (lysergic acid diethylamide)\u201d, and \u201ccocaine, heroin\u201d."

The descriptive statistical measures, including the mean and standard deviation (SD), were completed for evaluating the data. To conduct the univariate analysis aimed to compare the baseline demographic characteristics across sexual orientation groups (SMs vs. non-SMs), we used the Pearson\u2019s \u03c72 test, including Cramer\u2019s V (V) correlation coefficients. The correlation coefficient of more than 0.4 indicating a relatively strong or strong correlation between the variables has been analyzed; the correlation coefficient of between 0.2 and 0.4 indicated a moderate correlation; the correlation coefficients of less than 0.2 identifying a weak correlation between the variables have been analyzed.

Different distributions of the selected mental problems and negative well-being scores were observed in student cohorts according to the disparities in sexual orientation, namely, SMs vs. heterosexual individuals. In a sample of heterosexual students, 48.5% of subjects reported severe anxiety symptoms, 10.9% of subjects experienced severe depression, and 48.7% of individuals reported a negative well-being status. At the same time, in a sample of SMs, higher rates of mental health problems were identified in 64.6% of students with anxiety complaints, 20.6% of participants with depression, and 63.2% of individuals with a negative well-being status. In terms of effect size (d), it can be affirmed that higher rates for anxiety (HADS-A) and depression symptoms (HADS-D) were established in the SM category; therefore, these rates could be assigned to small effect sizes (d = 0.4 and d = 0.4). Lower rates of well-being scores were also found in SMs; thus, non-heterosexual populations could be attributed as a potential trigger for risking the development of a negative well-being status (d = 0.5). Additionally, Table A1 (Appendix A) provides the results for signs and symptoms associated with the well-being status of students. Self-reported symptoms of the disorders in the nervous (cognition, perception, emotional state, and behavior), respiratory (cough), digestive, circulatory (precordial pain), and nervous as well as musculoskeletal (muscle spasms in the neck and shoulder) systems related to a negative well-being state were more likely to be experienced by the SMs. Table 2 shows the results for the frequency of self-reported psychoactive substances administration among students. Overall, the most frequently used substances by students were tobacco (46%), alcohol (45.3%), and cannabis (marijuana) (7.5%). The proportion was found significantly lower among drugs, such as MDMA (ecstasy) (1.1%), amphetamines (0.7%), cocaine, heroin (0.7%), and LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) (0.6%) users. The results for different frequencies of self-reported psychoactive substance use were revealed depending on sexual orientation types. In terms of effect size (d), it can be asserted that the higher rates for tobacco, alcohol, cannabis (marijuana), and amphetamines use were found in the SMs, consequently these rates could be assigned to small effect sizes (d = 0.4, d = 0.3, d = 0.3, and d = 0.3).\nSustainability 2022, 14, 13063 8 of 16\nd\u2014the effect size; ***\u2014p-value < 0.001.

            "text": "The relationship between the SM status and mental issues, such as depression and anxiety, are the strongest during the period of 20\u201324 years of age [65]. Hence, anxiety and depression are the most reported mental disorders by university students [66]. Our study found that the proportions of clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety and depression in the sample of Lithuanian higher education students, with an approximate 4:1 ratio, were 51.2 and 12.6%, respectively. According to the current study, the unevenness was observed between mental health outcomes when comparing the generalized prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms (24.5 and 26.1%), with an approximate 0.9:1 ratio, across studentaged populations in other countries [67]. In addition, the findings of population-based studies carried out over the last 20 years revealed an overall higher risk for mental health problems in SM people than in heterosexual individuals [68]. To test this hypothesis in Lithuania, our study examined mental health disparities among students identified in non-SM and SM groups. Taking into account the results of this study conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, SM students reported a higher prevalence of both severe depressive and severe anxiety symptoms compared with heterosexual students. The findings of this study were in line with the report of the Fruehwirth et al. study [69], which revealed the more intense expression of severe symptoms of anxiety and depression in the SM students\u2019 cohort as well as the increased prevalence rates of these mental issues after the COVID-19 pandemic began. The current results from our study were empirically linked to the minority stress theory, which predicts the disparities in mental health outcomes for individuals with minority sexual orientations compared with heterosexual people in terms of the excessive minority stress potentially triggered by stigma-related experiences (i.e., discrimination, verbal and physical violence, microaggressions) [21,70\u201372]. In addition, sexual orientation disparities were empirically associated with the experiences of minority stressors; therefore, disparities in well-being status between SMs and heterosexual individuals were also earlier detected by scholars [44,45]. Still, our findings demonstrated the higher rate of well-being indexes identifying more negative well-being outcomes referred to self-reported complaints of disorders in the nervous, respiratory, digestive, circulatory, nervous, and musculoskeletal systems in a group of SM students compared with heterosexual students during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results of our study not only appertained to the negative SMs well-being status but were also consistent with the currently published work of Fish et al. [73], who observed similar sexual identity disparities revealed by several indicators of well-being during the COVID-19 crisis between adult bisexual vs. heterosexual subgroups in the United States. When assessing health-related behavior across student-age populations, including SMs, it is necessary to highlight that research conducted over the past 20 years has reliably revealed that SMs were more likely to be involved in hazardous drinking and experience alcohol use disorders or abuse and become dependent on illicit drugs compared to heterosexual individuals [74]. Furthermore, SMs were more likely to use tobacco products than heterosexual individuals of their same age and sex [75\u201378]. In the light of this data, the current study first of all clarified the health-risk behaviors allied to the largest proportions of tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis (marijuana) users corresponding to 46, 45.3, and 7.5% of the Lithuanian higher education students. When comparing our survey data\nSustainability 2022, 14, 13063 10 of 16\nassociated with the mid-pandemic report derived by the national drug, tobacco, and alcohol department [79], it was found that students aged 18\u201329 years were less likely to consume alcohol; nevertheless, they were more likely to engage in cigarette and cannabis (marijuana) smoking compared with the proportions of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana consumers (62, 34.9, and 4.3%, respectively) representing the Lithuanian residents of the age group within the range of 15\u201364 years. Secondly, the current study also disclosed higher proportions of student-aged users of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis (marijuana), and amphetamines found in a category of SMs compared to a group of heterosexuals. The less frequent use of alcohol and the increase in cigarette smoking in students compared to the general population can be explained by the fact that, overall, the rates of alcohol and drug use peak in early adulthood (ages 18\u201320) and decrease as individuals age [80]. Meanwhile, SMs have a greater likelihood of tobacco use disorder in emerging adulthood (aged 18\u201328) and the disparity declines with age [65]. Thus, a potential driver of smoking status amid SMs may be related to SM stressors and discrimination [81], which has been also reported at the highest rates during emerging adulthood [65]."

            "text": "Another important issue of this study is linked to the relationship between the healthrisk behaviors and the negative consequences triggered by psychoactive substances on mental health and well-being status across the groups of both SMs and heterosexuals. This study demonstrated that alcohol- and tobacco-related consequences were associated with an increased severity of anxiety symptoms along with negative outcomes of well-being indices in both cohorts identified in SMs and heterosexual individuals. These results were consistent with the data published by scholars, namely Smith et al. [82], Johnson et al. [83], and Kcomt et al. [84], and unveiled that anxiety can result from alcohol- and tobacco-related disturbances in both the general population and SMs. However, the current study did not detect any significant association between the increased severity of depressive symptoms and alcohol abuse or cigarette smoking. Apart from that, our findings were similar to the previously published data [85] identifying the absence of correlation between alcohol consumption and depression symptomatology among SMs. This study also found results concerning an inverse relationship between the increased rates in the frequency of cannabis (marijuana) administration and the decreased severity of anxiety symptoms suffered by SMs. These study findings were still consistent with the data reported by some experimental [86,87] and population-based studies [88\u201390] on the benefits of cannabis use for mental health (in terms of the positive outcomes of anxiety or depression). However, the subjects recruited into this study were illicit non-medical cannabis (marijuana) users. It remains unclear on the doses of non-medical cannabis (marijuana) used by SMs in Lithuania, which is a country that has not yet legalized the recreational use of cannabis. In addition, chronic exposure to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) can cause cannabis-related neurotoxic effects along with cognitive impairment [91], panic disorder [92], increased risk for developing depression [93], and other unwanted physical health problems [91]. While the long-term consequences of using medical or non-medical cannabis, perhaps as a form of self-medication or for anxiety, still remain unclear, the current study highlights the need for both randomized controlled trials along with longitudinal studies examining the symptom improvement and safety of medical cannabis use with average doses of 2.5 g/d [86] in SMs with anxiety disorder."

Other scholars have analyzed disparities related to SMs health across different cohorts, such as racial or ethnic [95].

Second, the survey we have conducted included measures of gender identity; however, we were unable to examine the disparities by gender-identity due to the relatively small sample size of the Lithuanian SMs. Therefore, it would be rational in the future to conduct empirical research in all Baltic States, namely Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. Third, other limitations of our study were associated with the self-report nature of data collection instead of clinical diagnoses. Finally, another limitation of this study was related to the fact that the causal association between the psychoactive substances use and mental issues along with well-being status should be elucidated with caution as this national survey was based on a cross-sectional design."

In terms of negative well-being, mental health problems, and health-risk behaviors, it can be declared that the sexual minority group was potentially more exposed than the heterosexual-identified student cohort. Sexual minority individuals were at a higher risk for the development of severity anxiety or depressive symptoms, a negative well-being state, as well as health-risk behaviors related to an increased use of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs, such as cannabis (marijuana) and amphetamines. Regardless of sexual minority status, this study revealed the association between clinically relevant anxiety symptoms, a negative well-being, and the health-risk behaviors involved both the frequency of alcohol consumption measure along with cigarette smoking rate across student-aged populations. The findings of the current study also identified the relationship between the increased self-administration of cannabis (marijuana), and positive mental health outcomes appertained to milder anxiety symptoms among studentaged sexual minorities. However, this study did not support the association between the higher levels of the most common psychoactive substance use and the elevated prevalence of clinically relevant depressive symptoms. Given that minority stressors could play a significant role in mediating between the sexual orientation and the negative outcomes of mental health and behavioral health in student-aged populations, health strategies should focus on the necessary monitoring of anxiety and depression together with routine evaluation of changes to sexual minorities\u2019 mental health and health-risk behaviors. The study also highlights the importance of developing both student-centered and sexual minorities-centered effective substance abuse prevention programs coupled with drug prevention programs for reducing health-risk behaviors in emerging adulthood individuals.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.B., I.K., and R.S.; methodology, M.B.; software, M.B.; validation, M.B., I.K., and R.S.; formal analysis, M.B., R.S., and I.K.; investigation, M.B.; resources, M.B. and I.K.; data curation, R.S. and M.B.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.B. and R.S.; writing\u2014review and editing, I.K., R.S., and M.B.; visualization, M.B.; supervision, R.S. and I.K.; project administration, I.K. and M.B.
