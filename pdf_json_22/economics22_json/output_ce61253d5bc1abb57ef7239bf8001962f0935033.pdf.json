We identify exact conditions under which generally these Gately values are Core imputations for arbitrary regular cooperative games.

            "heading": "1 Introduction: Gately\u2019s solution concept",
            "text": "Gately (1974) seminally considered an allocation method founded on individual players\u2019 opportunities to disrupt the negotiations regarding the allocation of the generated collective payoffs. This conception is akin to the underlying logic of the Core (Gillies, 1959) of a cooperative game: Coalitions of players would threaten to abandon the negotiations over the allocation of the total generated collective worth, if the offered allocation does not at least assign each coalition\u2019s worth in the cooperative game.1 Gately\u2019s conception formalises to what extend coalitions would disrupt such negotiations.\nGately introduced the notion of an individual player\u2019s propensity to disrupt, expressing the relative disruption an individual player causes when leaving the negotiations. In fact, Gately formulated this \u201cpropensity to disrupt\u201d as the ratio of the other players\u2019 collective loss and the individual player\u2019s loss due to disruption of the negotiations. The prevailing solution method aims to minimise the maximal propensity to disrupt over all imputations and players in the game. Staudacher and Anwander (2019) show that for most cooperative games this solution method results in a unique imputation, which we can denote as the Gately value of the game under consideration.\nClearly, Gately\u2019s solution concept falls within the category of a bargaining-based solution concepts (Maschler, 1992) that also encompasses, e.g., the bargaining set (Aumann and Maschler, 1964), the Kernel (Davis and Maschler, 1965), and the Nucleolus (Schmeidler, 1969).2 Contrary to many of these bargaining-based solution concepts, Gately\u2019s conception results in an easily to compute allocation rule that can also be categorised as a compromise value such as the CIS-value (Driessen and Funaki, 1991) and the \ud835\udf0f-value (Tijs, 1981). These solution concepts have a fundamentally different axiomatic foundation than the fairness-based allocation rules such as the egalitarian solution, the Shapley value (Shapley, 1953), the Banzhaf value (Banzhaf, 1965; Lehrer, 1988), and related notions.\nGately (1974) investigated his conception in the setting of one particular 3-player cost game only. Gately\u2019s notion was extended to arbitrary \ud835\udc5b-player cooperative games by Littlechild and Vaidya (1976). 3 Charnes et al. (1978) introduced various concepts that are closely related to an extended notion of the propensity to disrupt. They introduced mollifiers and homomollifiers, measuring the disparities emerging from abandonment of negotiations as differences rather than ratios. These formulations result in associated games with a given cooperative game. Charnes et al. (1978) primarily investigated the properties of these associated games.\nGately points: Existence, uniqueness and relationship with the Core Staudacher and Anwander (2019) point out that the original research questions as posed by Gately (1974) were never properly investigated and answered in the literature. In particular, Staudacher and Anwander focussed on one particular application within the broad range of possibilities in Gately\u2019s approach, namely the so-called Gately point\u2014defined as an imputation in which all propensities to disrupt\n1It is, therefore, implicitly assumed that a coalition can generate its worth independently of the actions taken by players and coalitions outside that coalition.\n2For an overview of these solution concepts we also refer to textbooks such as Moulin (1986, 2004), Maschler et al. (2013), Owen (2013) and Gilles (2010).\n3Littlechild and Vaidya used their extended notion of propensity to disrupt to define the Disruption Nucleolus in which these propensities are lexicographically minimised.\nare balanced and minimal. The Gately point is a solution to a minimax problem and Staudacher and Anwander show that every standard cooperative game has a unique Gately point. This settles indeed the most basic question concerning Gately\u2019s original conception.\nHere, we provide a natural and constructive characterisation of the Gately value based on three simple properties. These properties relate to the properties introduced by Tijs (1987) to characterise the \ud835\udf0f-value for quasi-balanced cooperative games. We modify these properties for the class of regular cooperative games to fully axiomatise the Gately value for this class of games. This shows in detail that the Gately value is actually a compromise value on the class of regular cooperative games.\nFinally, we introduce the dual Gately value as the Gately point of the dual of a given cooperative game. We show that the dual Gately value is identical to the Gately value for the broad class of regular games. Hence, the Gately value is self-dual.\nGately\u2019s definition of his propensity to disrupt puts equal weight on assessing the loss or gain of the other players versus the loss or gain of the player under consideration. We consider a parametric formulation in which a weight is attached to the relative importance of the gain or loss of the individual player in comparison with the weight attached to the gain or loss of all other players in the game. The higher the assigned weight, the more an individual\u2019s loss or gain due to disruption is taken into account.\nThe imputations that balance these weighted propensities to disrupt are now referred to as generalised \ud835\udefc-Gately points, where \ud835\udefc > 0 is the weight put on an individual\u2019s loss or gain due to disruption. It is clear that \ud835\udefc = 1 refers to the original Gately point. We show that for all \ud835\udefc > 0, all regular cooperative games admit a unique \ud835\udefc-Gately point, generalising the insight of Staudacher and Anwander (2019).\nFor any \ud835\udefc > 0, the unique \ud835\udefc-Gately point is in the Core of the game if and only if the game satisfies \ud835\udefc-Top Dominance, a parametric variant of the top convexity condition. In particular, the \ud835\udefc-Top Dominance condition implies that the game is regular as well as partitionally superadditive. However, counterexamples show that there exist superadditive games with non-empty Cores that do not contain any \ud835\udefc-Gately point.\nAnalysis of the Gately value and other solution concepts The main contribution of this paper is the investigation of the relationship between the Gately value and other solution concepts on the class of regular cooperative games. In particular, we explore the Gately value as a Core selector and under what conditions the Gately and Shapley values coincide.\nGately (1974) states clearly that he views the conception of Gately points and related concepts based on his notion of \u201cpropensity to disrupt\u201d as leading to Core selectors. This is exemplified by the underlying conception of Gately\u2019s solution method as a Core-based bargaining process. In particular, this is supported by the analysis of the cost games considered by Gately (1974), which have rather large Cores. Here, we primarily explore the interesting and yet unexplored relationship between Gately points and the Core. In particular, we show that the unique Gately point is a Core selector for every regular 3-player cooperative game.\nLittlechild and Vaidya (1976) already showed that this cannot be extended to \ud835\udc5b-player games by constructing a 4-player game in which the Gately point is not in the Core. Nevertheless we are\nable to establish the exact conditions for which the unique Gately point is in the Core of a regular \ud835\udc5b-player game. We refer to this condition as top dominance in which the grand coalition generates the largest net benefit in relation to the marginal player contributions. This condition reduces to top convexity for zero-normalised games (Shubik, 1982; Jackson and van den Nouweland, 2005).\nThe axiomatic solution concept seminally introduced by Shapley (1953) is now widely accepted as the prime value for cooperative games. It has resulted in a vast literature on determining the Shapley value and its properties on certain classes of cooperative games such as communication situations (Myerson, 1977, 1980), network games (Jackson and Wolinsky, 1996), and hierarchical permission structures (Gilles et al., 1992; Gilles and Owen, 1999). This indicates the validity of the question for which subclasses of cooperative games an alternative solution concept is equivalent to the Shapley value.\nWe investigate this equivalence property for the Gately value and conclude that for certain classes of regular games the Gately value results in exactly the same imputation as the Shapley value. This includes the class of cooperative games generated by unanimity games of equal-sized coalitions, the so-called the subclasses of \ud835\udc58-games (van den Brink et al., 2023). Other classes of highly regular games also possess this equivalence property, showing that potentially for many subclasses of highly regular cooperative games these values might coincide.\nIn particular, the Gately and Shapley values are equivalent on the specific subclass of 2-games. This equivalence enables us to utilise the characterisation developed in van den Brink et al. (2023, Theorem 1) to establish an axiomatisation of the Gately value within this particular relevant subclass of regular games. In fact, the 2-games subset encompasses the depiction of productive interaction on networks, where binary value-generating activity occurs on the links forming the network. The insight that many values are equivalent on this particular subclass of 2-games is relevant in the analysis of these games.\nStructure of the paper We introduce and illustrate Gately\u2019s approach through a simple application to a trade problem with three traders in Section 2. Section 3 develops the formal treatment of Gately\u2019s approach, defines generalised Gately points and values, and discusses the dual of the Gately value. This section concludes with a natural and simple axiomatisation of the Gately value. Section 4 is devoted to the investigation of the relationship of Gately points, the Core and the Nucleolus for 3-player games. We conclude the paper in Section 5 with the investigation of the Gately value with the Core for arbitrary \ud835\udc5b-player games and the relationship between the Gately and Shapley values."

If seller S and buyer B1 negotiate a settlement price of \ud835\udc43 \u2a7e 0, the result is a gain from trade of \ud835\udc43 \u2212 1 for seller S and a gain from trade of 3\u2212\ud835\udc43 for buyer B1. Clearly, the only viable trades are made at prices that would result in non-negative gains from trade for both seller S and buyer B1. Therefore, the viable range of trades would be 1 \u2a7d \ud835\udc43 \u2a7d 3. Similarly, a trade between seller S and buyer B2 results in gains from trade of \ud835\udc43 \u2212 1 and 2 \u2212 \ud835\udc43 , respectively. Note that the viable range for such a trade is given as 1 \u2a7d \ud835\udc43 \u2a7d 2.\nRepresentation the trade situation as a cooperative game We can represent this bargaining situation as a cooperative game \ud835\udc63 on {\ud835\udc46, \ud835\udc351, \ud835\udc352}.4 Indeed, if there is no trade and seller S retains the ownership rights, he retains the intrinsic value assigned to the object. Hence, seller S by herself generates a personal value of \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46) = 1. Similarly, for both buyers \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc351) = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc352) = 0 if there is no trade.\nThe total value generated from a trade between seller S and buyer B1 at any viable price \ud835\udc43 is now the sum of the intrinsic value of the object plus the total gains from trade. Hence, the generated total wealth is given by \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46, \ud835\udc351) = 1 + (\ud835\udc43 \u2212 1) + (3 \u2212 \ud835\udc43) = 3 irrespective of the agreed terms of trade in the viable range 1 \u2a7d \ud835\udc43 \u2a7d 3. Similarly, a trade between seller S and buyer B2 at a viable price \ud835\udc43 generates a collective wealth of \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46, \ud835\udc352) = 1 + (\ud835\udc43 \u2212 1) + (2 \u2212 \ud835\udc43) = 2 for any 1 \u2a7d \ud835\udc43 \u2a7d 2.\nIf seller S negotiates trade with both buyers B1 and B2 simultaneously, there would be no further gains than the gains from trade generated from a trade between seller S and buyer B1. Now, the total value from a trade resulting from the grand negotiation would be \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46, \ud835\udc351, \ud835\udc352) = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46, \ud835\udc351) = 3.\nTherefore, this representation of this trade situation as a cooperative game is fully described by \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46) = 1, \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc351) = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc352) = 0, \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46, \ud835\udc351) = 3, \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46, \ud835\udc352) = 2, \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc351, \ud835\udc352) = 0 and \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46, \ud835\udc351, \ud835\udc352) = 3.\nAn imputation in this game theoretic representation is a triple (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 , \ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652) \u2208 R3+ such that \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 +\ud835\udc651+\ud835\udc652 = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46, \ud835\udc351, \ud835\udc352) = 3 and \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 \u2a7e \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc56) for \ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc60, 1, 2, where \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 \u2a7e 1 represents the payout assigned to seller S, \ud835\udc651 \u2a7e 0 the payout made to buyer B1, and \ud835\udc652 \u2a7e 0 the payout made to buyer B2, respectively. These payouts are assumed to be negotiated between the three trading parties and, therefore, add up to the total value generated from their interaction.\nThe Core of this game consists of all imputations such that \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 + \ud835\udc651 \u2a7e \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46, \ud835\udc351) = 3 and \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 + \ud835\udc652 \u2a7e \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46, \ud835\udc352) = 2. Here the value generated between from the trade between seller S and buyer B2 is used as an outside option for seller S, providing a lower bound of \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46, \ud835\udc352) = 2 on the allocation to seller S. The Core can therefore be determined as \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) = {(\ud835\udc61, 3 \u2212 \ud835\udc61, 0) | 2 \u2a7d \ud835\udc61 \u2a7d 3}.\nWe compute the Shapley value (Shapley, 1953) of this trade situation as \ud835\udf11 (\ud835\udc63) = ( 2 16 , 2 3 , 1 6 ) . We remark that the Shapley value is not a Core allocation, i.e., \ud835\udf11 (\ud835\udc63) \u2209 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63). Finally, we compute the Nucleolus (Schmeidler, 1969) of this trade situation, which is a well-\nknown selector of the Core. In fact, N(\ud835\udc63) = ( 2 12 , 1 2 , 0 ) \u2208 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) is actually the central imputation of the Core of this game as it is the middle point of the set \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) as a line piece in R3. 4We emphasise that this bargaining situation can also be represented as a non-cooperative game, as is pursued through a well-developed and major literature. Here the focus is on a TU-representation in which the main question is what a proper and fair allocation of the generated gains from trade would be.\nGately\u2019s conception Gately (1974) introduced the idea that during a negotiation between the seller and the two buyers, each of these three parties can disrupt the proceedings by departing the negotiations. Gately\u2019s analysis was explicitly introduced to delineate and focus on a Core selector in the 3-player application explored in Gately (1974).5 Gately pursued a much simpler solution than the Nucleolus, which is notoriously hard to compute (Maschler, 1992).\nGately founded his approach on an innovative method to describe the negotiation process of allocating the worth generated in the cooperative situation. His focal point was on the disruption of the negotiation process that each individual player can cause. This disruption can be measured through a player\u2019s \u201cpropensity to disrupt\u201d. Gately (1974, p. 200\u2013201) introduces this concept as \u201cthe ratio of how much the two other players would lose if a player would refuse to cooperate to how much that player would lose if it refused to cooperate\u201d.\nIf the negotiators consider a proposed imputation (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 , \ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652) \u2a7e (1, 0, 0) with \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 +\ud835\udc651+\ud835\udc652 = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) = 3, Gately\u2019s notion of the propensity to disrupt by seller S would then be the ratio of the buyers\u2019 potential loss \ud835\udc651 + \ud835\udc652 \u2212 \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc351, \ud835\udc352) to the seller\u2019s potential loss from non-cooperation, computed as \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 \u2212 \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46). Hence, using \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 + \ud835\udc651 + \ud835\udc652 = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) = 3, the seller S\u2019s propensity to disrupt is\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc60 (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 , \ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652) = \ud835\udc651 + \ud835\udc652 \u2212 \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc351, \ud835\udc352) \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 \u2212 \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46) = \ud835\udc651 + \ud835\udc652 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 \u2212 1 = 3 \u2212 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 \u2212 1 = 2 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 \u2212 1 \u2212 1.\nSimilarly, we construct the propensity to disrupt for both buyers as\n\ud835\udc511(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 , \ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652) = \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 + \ud835\udc652 \u2212 \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46, \ud835\udc352) \ud835\udc651 \u2212 \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc351) = \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 + \ud835\udc652 \u2212 2 \ud835\udc651 = 1 \ud835\udc651 \u2212 1 \ud835\udc512(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 , \ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652) = \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 + \ud835\udc651 \u2212 \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46, \ud835\udc351)\n\ud835\udc652 \u2212 \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc352) = \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 + \ud835\udc651 \u2212 3 \ud835\udc652 = \u22121\nGately\u2019s motivation was that, if a player would get a relatively small payout, the player\u2019s propensity to disrupt the agreement is relatively high.6 Now, the stated objective of Gately\u2019s proposed solution is to select an imputation that minimises the maximum propensity to disrupt at that imputation. Hence, one should select an imputation that solves the minimax problem stated as\nmin (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 ,\ud835\udc651,\ud835\udc652 )\u2a7e (1,0,0) : \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60+\ud835\udc651+\ud835\udc652=3 max {\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc60 (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 , \ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652), \ud835\udc511(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 , \ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652), \ud835\udc512(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 , \ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652) } .\nThis is clearly resulting in the requirement that \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc60 (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 , \ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652) = \ud835\udc511(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 , \ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652), since \ud835\udc512(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 , \ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652) = \u22121 is certainly not a maximum. This results in Gately\u2019s solution to be determined by the equations\n2 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 \u2212 1 = 1 \ud835\udc651\nand \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 + \ud835\udc651 = 3 with \ud835\udc652 = 0.\nTherefore, the solution to Gately\u2019s minimax problem is unique and determined as \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc63) = (2 13 , 2 3 , 0).\n5From the stated methodology, Gately\u2019s focus is on how individual players negotiate on the allocation of collectively generated worth. The methodology is similar to the definition of the Core as those allocations to which there are no objections, in the sense that there are no coalitional incentives to abandon the negotiations to allocate the collectively generated worth by pursuing an alternative arrangement.\n6In particular, if a player would not get any benefit in the negations in the sense that \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc56), her propensity to disrupt is infinitely large. Similarly, if the player would be proposed to receive the total generated benefit \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ), her propensity to disrupt is usually negative.\nWe remark that \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc63) \u2208 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) is indeed a Core allocation for this particular example.\nGeneralising Gately\u2019s solution conception We propose a generalisation of Gately\u2019s conception in which the definition of a player\u2019s propensity to disrupt is modified by imposing a weight on the denominator. This weight represents an intensity parameter that measures how much more or less weight a player puts on her own loss in relation to the loss of all other players. Hence, we assume that a player can discount her own losses due to disruption or, conversely, assign more weight to her own losses than the losses of the other players.\nFormally, we introduce a weight parameter \ud835\udefd > 0 for the denominator in Gately\u2019s propensity to disrupt. Instead of applying this directly to the formulated propensity to disrupt \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc60, 1, 2, itself, we apply this weight in the modified form \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56 + 1. Hence, for each of the three parties in the trading situation considered, we introduce the \ud835\udefd-weighted propensity to disrupt as\n\ud835\udf0c \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc60 (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 , \ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652) = 2 (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 \u2212 1)\ud835\udefd > 0 \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udefd1 (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 , \ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652) = 1 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udefd\n1\n> 0 \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udefd\ud835\udc60 (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 , \ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652) = 0\nFor any \ud835\udefd > 0, a generalised Gately solution would solve the minimax problem given by\nmin (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 ,\ud835\udc651,\ud835\udc652 )\u2a7e (1,0,0) : \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60+\ud835\udc651+\ud835\udc652=3\nmax { \ud835\udf0c \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc60 (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 , \ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652), \ud835\udf0c \ud835\udefd 1 (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 , \ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652), \ud835\udf0c \ud835\udefd 2 (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 , \ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652) } .\nThe generalised solution for this modified Gately conception is now determined by the equations:\n2 (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 \u2212 1)\ud835\udefd = 1 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udefd\n1\nand \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60 + \ud835\udc651 = 3 with \ud835\udc652 = 0.\nThe equations stated above lead to the conclusion that, for every \ud835\udefd > 0, the generalised Gately solution is given as \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefd (\ud835\udc63) = ( 1+3 \ud835\udefd \u221a 2\n1+ \ud835\udefd \u221a 2 , 2 1+ \ud835\udefd \u221a 2 , 0\n) . We remark that \ud835\udc541(\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc63), \ud835\udefd \u2192 \u221e implies\n\ud835\udc54\ud835\udefd (\ud835\udc63) \u2192 (2, 1, 0), and \ud835\udefd \u2193 0 implies \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefd (\ud835\udc63) \u2192 (3, 0, 0). We conclude that there is a close relationship between these generalised Gately solutions and the Core of this game in the sense that every generalised Gately solution is in the Core and that the relative interior of the Core is mapped through these generalised Gately solutions:{\n\ud835\udc54\ud835\udefd (\ud835\udc63) | \ud835\udefd > 0 } = \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5c (\ud835\udc63) = {(\ud835\udc61, 3 \u2212 \ud835\udc61, 0) | 2 < \ud835\udc61 < 3} \u228a \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) .\nThis close relationship between these values and the Core refers directly to Gately (1974)\u2019s original motivation to identify his solutions as Core selectors. This is explored further below."

In particular, we denote the collection of regular zero-normalised games by V\u0302\ud835\udc41 = V\ud835\udc41\u2605 \u2229 V\ud835\udc410 .\nAn allocation in the game \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 is any point \ud835\udc65 \u2208 R\ud835\udc41 such that \ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udc41 ) = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ), where we denote by \ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udc46) = \u2211\ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc57 the allocated payoff to the coalition \ud835\udc46 \u2208 2\ud835\udc41 .

We emphasise that allocations can assign positive as well as negative payoffs to individual players in a game.\nAn imputation in the game \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 is an allocation \ud835\udc65 \u2208 A(\ud835\udc63) that is individually rational in the sense that \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 \u2a7e \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 for every player \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 . The corresponding imputation set of \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 is now given by I(\ud835\udc63) = {\ud835\udc65 \u2208 A(\ud835\udc63) | \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 \u2a7e \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 for all \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 }.

In particular, this holds for the class of regular games V\ud835\udc41\u2605 .\nWe recall that for any cooperative game \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 , the Core is defined as a set of imputations \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) \u2282 I(\ud835\udc63) such that \ud835\udc65 \u2208 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) if and only for all coalitions \ud835\udc46 \u2208 2\ud835\udc41 : \ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udc46) \u2a7e \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46).

This compares to the CIS value (Driessen and Funaki, 1991).

Again, this can be interpreted as a variation of the CIS value.\nThe next definition introduces a generalised formulation of Gately\u2019s seminal notion of the propensity to disrupt. We show that \ud835\udefc-Gately values are closely related to optimisation problems based on this generalised notion.\nDefinition 3.5 Let \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 be some cooperative game on player set \ud835\udc41 . For every parameter \ud835\udefd > 0 the corresponding generalised \ud835\udefd-propensity to disrupt of player \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 at imputation \ud835\udc65 \u2208 I(\ud835\udc63) is defined by\n\ud835\udf0c \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56\n(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 \u2212 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56)\ud835\udefd (11)\nWe note here that for \ud835\udefd = 1, this generalised propensity to disrupt corresponds exactly to the original propensity to disrupt for an individual player as introduced by Gately (1974), in the sense that \ud835\udf0c1\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63)\u2212\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc65) + 1.\nThe following theorem shows the relationship between the balancing of such generalised propensities to disrupt and corresponding \ud835\udefc-Gately values. In particular, it is shown that the \ud835\udefc-Gately value can be interpreted as a bargaining value, like the original Gately value and the Nucleolus. Furthermore, for certain values of \ud835\udefc , the minimisation of the generated total generalised propensity to disrupt at an allocation results in the corresponding \ud835\udefc-Gately value.\nTheorem 3.6 Let \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41\u2605 be a regular cooperative game on \ud835\udc41 .\n(a) Let \ud835\udefc > 0 and define \ud835\udefd = 1 \ud835\udefc . Then the \ud835\udefc-Gately value \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc (\ud835\udc63) \u2208 I(\ud835\udc63) is the unique \ud835\udefd-Gately point\nin the sense that \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc (\ud835\udc63) is the unique imputation that satisfies the property that\n\ud835\udf0c \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc (\ud835\udc63) ) \u2a7d min \ud835\udc65\u2208I(\ud835\udc63) max \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udf0c \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc65) (12)\nfor every player \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 .\n(b) Let 0 < \ud835\udefc < 1 and define \ud835\udefd = 1\u2212\ud835\udefc \ud835\udefc > 0. Then the \ud835\udefc-Gately value \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc (\ud835\udc63) \u2208 I(\ud835\udc63) is the unique solution to the minimisation of the total aggregated generalised \ud835\udefd-propensity to disrupt of the\ngame \ud835\udc63 :\n\ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc (\ud835\udc63) = arg min\ud835\udc65\u2208I(\ud835\udc63) \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udf0c \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc65) (13)\nProof. To show assertion (a), we note that for every imputation \ud835\udc65 \u2208 I(\ud835\udc63) and every player \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 : \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udefd\n\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63)\u2212\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 )\ud835\udefd \u2a7e 0 from the hypothesis that \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2a7e \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 . Furthermore, since \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc63) > \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 for at\nleast one \ud835\udc57 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 , we conclude that \ud835\udc5f = max\ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udefd\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc65) > 0. Hence, we conclude that the minimax problem min\ud835\udc65\u2208I(\ud835\udc63) max\ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udf0c \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc65) can be solved by identifying \ud835\udc5f > 0 and an imputation \ud835\udc65\u2217 \u2208 I(\ud835\udc63) such that \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udefd \ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc65\u2217) = \ud835\udc5f for all \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc410 = {\ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 | \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) > \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56} \u2260 \u2205. First, note that for all \ud835\udc57 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 \\\ud835\udc410 = { \ud835\udc57 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 | \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 } we can set \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc57 = \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 . Next, for \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc410 we can\nnow solve for \ud835\udc5f > 0 as well as \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 . Rewriting \ud835\udf0c \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc5f , we derive that \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 =\n( \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63)\u2212\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc5f\n) 1 \ud835\udefd + \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 .\nNote that, since \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2a7e \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 for all \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 , it follows that \ud835\udc65 \u2208 I(\ud835\udc63). Hence,\n\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 = \u2211 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc410 (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56) 1 \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc5f 1 \ud835\udefd + \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 \u2261 \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 )\nSince \u2211 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc410 (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56) 1 \ud835\udefd = \u2211 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56) 1 \ud835\udefd , we conclude that\n\ud835\udc5f =\n[\u2211 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56) 1 \ud835\udefd ]\ud835\udefd [ \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212 \u2211\ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 ]\ud835\udefd > 0.\nFrom this we conclude that the identified solution exists and is unique under the regularity conditions on the game \ud835\udc63 . Substituting the formulated solution of \ud835\udc5f back into the formulation for the solution, we deduce that\n\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 + (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56) 1 \ud835\udefd\u2211\n\ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 (\ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 ) 1 \ud835\udefd\n( \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 ) \u2a7e \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 .\nRecalling that \ud835\udefd = 1 \ud835\udefc , we indeed conclude that \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63), leading us to conclude that assertion (a) has been shown. To show assertion (b), consider the minimisation problem min\ud835\udc65\u2208I(\ud835\udc63) \ud835\udc45\ud835\udefd (\ud835\udc65) as formulated, where \ud835\udc45\ud835\udefd (\ud835\udc65) = \u2211\ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udefd\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc65).

The resulting allocations for the other players \ud835\udc57 = 2, . . . , \ud835\udc5b are derived in a similar fashion. We remark that Theorem 3.6 applies to regular cost games or problems as well. Indeed, for a cost game \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 satisfying \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2a7d \u2211\ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc3d , \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2a7d \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 \u2a7d 0 for all \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 and \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc63) < \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 \u2a7d 0 for some \ud835\udc57 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 , both assertions of Theorem 3.6 hold. We do not consider these games here, but refer to, e.g., Moulin (2004) for a discussion of these cost games.\nTo illustrate the importance of regularity of those cooperative games for which Gately values are well-defined as imposed in Theorem 3.6(a), we consider the next example of a three-player game that exhibits non-regularities.\nExample 3.7 Consider a 3-player game \ud835\udc63 on \ud835\udc41 = {1, 2, 3} defined by \ud835\udc631 = 2, \ud835\udc632 = 1, \ud835\udc633 = 0, \ud835\udc63 (12) = \ud835\udc63 (13) = \ud835\udc63 (23) = 4 and \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) = 5. We remark that the marginal contributions can now be computed as \ud835\udc401 = \ud835\udc402 = \ud835\udc403 = 1, leading to the conclusion that \ud835\udc401 \u2212 \ud835\udc631 = \u22121 < 0, \ud835\udc402 = \ud835\udc632, and \ud835\udc403 \u2212 \ud835\udc633 = 1 > 0. Hence, this game is clearly neither essential nor semi-standard.9\n9We also remark that this game has actually an empty Core.\nWe show that this game admits a continuum of Gately points, thereby illustrating that this game does not have a well-defined, unique Gately value. Note that for any proposed solution \ud835\udc65 \u2208 A(\ud835\udc63) :\n\ud835\udf0c1(\ud835\udc65) = \u22121\n\ud835\udc651 \u2212 2 \ud835\udf0c2(\ud835\udc65) = 0 \ud835\udf0c3(\ud835\udc65) = 1 \ud835\udc653\nAll Gately points are now characterised by two equations, namely \ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udc41 ) = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) and \ud835\udf0c1(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udf0c3(\ud835\udc65) \u2a7e 0. This leads to the conclusion that the set of Gately points is a continuum given by {(\ud835\udc61, 3, 2 \u2212 \ud835\udc61) | 0 \u2a7d \ud835\udc61 \u2a7d 2} \u2282 A(\ud835\udc63). Note that this set of Gately points includes allocations that are not imputations. \u2666\nWith regard to Theorem 3.6(b) we remark that for \ud835\udefd = 1 the minimisation of the aggregated total propensity to disrupt \ud835\udc451(\ud835\udc65) = \u2211\ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc65) results in the 12 -Gately value as the unique solution. Furthermore, if \ud835\udefd = 0, the generalised propensity to disrupt for any player \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 is no longer a function of the allocation \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 , implying that the total aggregated 0-propensity to disrupt is a constant function. This implies that the minimisation problem (13) has a continuum of solutions, including all Gately points."

Then the dual game of \ud835\udc63 , denoted by \ud835\udc63\u2217 : 2\ud835\udc41 \u2192 R, is defined by\n\ud835\udc63\u2217(\ud835\udc46) = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212 \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 \\ \ud835\udc46) for every coalition \ud835\udc46 \u2208 2\ud835\udc41 (14)\nThe dual of a game assigns to every coalition \ud835\udc46 \u2286 \ud835\udc41 the worth that is lost by the grand coalition \ud835\udc41 if coalition \ud835\udc46 leaves the game. Note in particular that \ud835\udc63\u2217(\u2205) = 0, \ud835\udc63\u2217(\ud835\udc41 ) = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) and \ud835\udc63\u2217\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc63\u2217({\ud835\udc56}) = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212 \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 \u2212 \ud835\udc56) = \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) for all \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 . Finally, \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63\u2217) = \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 for every \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 .\nWe investigate the \u201cdual\u201d of a given value, which assign to games the value of its dual game. As an illustrative example, we note that Driessen and Funaki (1991) considered the dual of the CIS-value, defined as the CIS-value of the dual game. They refer to this notion as the \u201cEgalitarian Non-Separable Contribution\u201d value, or ENSC-value.\nWe can apply a similar procedure to the Gately value. We note first that the dual of a Gately value only can properly formulated for parameter values that are natural numbers, i.e., \ud835\udefc \u2208 N. This is subject to the next definition.\nDefinition 3.8 Let \ud835\udefc \u2208 N. The dual \ud835\udefc-Gately value is a map \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc : V\ud835\udc41\u2605 \u2192 R\ud835\udc41 that assigns to every regular cooperative game \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41\u2605 the \ud835\udefc-Gately value of its dual game \ud835\udc63\u2217 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 , i.e., \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc (\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc (\ud835\udc63\u2217) \u2208 A(\ud835\udc63).\nThe next proposition considers some properties of dual \ud835\udefc-Gately values.\nProposition 3.9 Consider a regular cooperative game \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41\u2605 and let \ud835\udefc \u2208 N be a natural number.

            "text": "It is easy to see that the Gately value on the class of regular games V\ud835\udc41\u2605 is a compromise value of the individual worth vector and the net marginal contribution vector. Indeed, for any regular game \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41\u2605 , the individual worth vector is given by \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc63 = (\ud835\udc631, . . . , \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc5b) and the net marginal contribution vector by \ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc40 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc63 = (\ud835\udc401(\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc631, . . . , \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc5b (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc5b ). Now the Gately value \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc63) for game \ud835\udc63 can be written as\n\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc63 + \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc63 \u00b7 (\ud835\udc40 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc63) = (1 \u2212 \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc63 )\ud835\udf08\ud835\udc63 + \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc40 (\ud835\udc63)\nwhere \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc63 = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212 \u2211\ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56\u2211 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56) .\nThis re-interpretation of the Gately value as a compromise value holds on the class of regular games V\ud835\udc41\u2605 and allows us to characterise the Gately value as such a compromise value.\nWe remark that the compromise values form a distinct subclass of solution concepts that are based on a similar methodology of determining the exact allocation of the worth of the grand coalition \ud835\udc41 . This refers to the fundamental property that the value is a convex combination of a well-defined lower and upper bound such that the value satisfies efficiency. We refer to Tijs and Otten (1993) and Gilles and van den Brink (2023) for detailed discussion and characterisations of these solution concepts.\nA constructive axiomatisation of the Gately value Tijs (1987) devised a simple axiomatisation for the \ud835\udf0f-value (Tijs, 1981) that is completely based on the property that the \ud835\udf0f-value is a compromise value. We can devise a similar axiomatisation of the Gately value by replicating Tijs\u2019s characterisation methodology to the Gately value to arrive at the following axiomatisation.\nIn this characterisation, a variant of the compromise property and the restricted proportionality property, seminally introduced by Tijs (1987) on the class of quasi-balanced games, can be constructed on the class of regular cooperative games V\ud835\udc41\u2605 .\nTheorem 3.11 The Gately value \ud835\udc54 is the unique map \ud835\udc53 : V\ud835\udc41\u2605 \u2192 R\ud835\udc41 on the class of regular games V\ud835\udc41\u2605 that satisfies the following three properties:\n(i) Efficiency: \u2211\n\ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) for every \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41\u2605 ;\n(ii) \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc63-Compromise property: For every regular game \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41\u2605 : \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc63 + \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc63 \u2212 \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc63), where \ud835\udc63 \u2212 \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\u0302\ud835\udc41 is the zero-normalisation of \ud835\udc63 defined by (\ud835\udc63 \u2212 \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc63) (\ud835\udc46) = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46) \u2212 \u2211 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 for every\ncoalition \ud835\udc46 \u2208 2\ud835\udc41 , and;\n(iii) Restricted proportionality property: For every zero-normalised regular cooperative game \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\u0302\ud835\udc41 : \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc40 (\ud835\udc63) for some \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc63 \u2208 R.\nProof. We first show that the Gately value \ud835\udc54 : V\ud835\udc41\u2605 \u2192 R\ud835\udc41 satisfies the three stated properties. For that purpose let \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41\u2605 .\n(i) Obviously the Gately value \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc63) is efficient for \ud835\udc63 .\n(ii) Let \ud835\udc64 = \ud835\udc63 \u2212 \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc410 be the zero-normalisation of \ud835\udc63 .

Then for any \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 : \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63)\u2211 \ud835\udc57 \u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc63) \u00b7 \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) showing restricted\nproportionality with \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc63 = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 )\u2211 \ud835\udc57 \u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc63) .\nNext, we show that if \ud835\udc53 : V\ud835\udc41\u2605 \u2192 R\ud835\udc41 satisfies the three stated properties, it is equal to the Gately value. Take any regular game \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41\u2605 and let \ud835\udc64 = \ud835\udc63 \u2212 \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\u0302\ud835\udc41 be its zero-normalisation. Then from restricted proportionality we have that \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc64) = \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc40 (\ud835\udc64) = \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc64 (\ud835\udc40 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc63). Furthermore, from the compromise property we conclude that\n\ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc63 + \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc63 \u2212 \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc63 + \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc40 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc63) .\nUsing efficiency we then conclude that\n\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) = \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc63 (\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 ) = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 )\nimplying that \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc63 = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212 \u2211\ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56\u2211 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56) .\nWe immediately conclude from this that \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63), showing the assertion.\nThe axiomatisation in Theorem 3.11 is constructive in the sense that it shows basic properties satisfied by the Gately value. These three properties are independent as the next discussion shows.\nThe efficiency property is a well-established property that is used throughout the literature. It guarantees that the allocation rule selects from the set of imputations in the game rather than the broader set of allocations. We note that the allocation rule \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udc40 (\ud835\udc63) on V\ud835\udc41\u2605 clearly satisfies the compromise property as well as the restricted proportionality property, but which is not efficient.\nThe \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc63-compromise property is a reduced form of additivity and as such decomposes the allocation rule in a translation of the allocation assigned to the zero-normalisation of the game. This property originated in Tijs (1987) as the \u201ccompromise property\u201d for the minimal right vector\ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc63) rather than\nthe vector of individual worths \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc63 . It is clear that the \ud835\udf0f-value satisfies efficiency and the restricted proportionality property. It does not satisfy the \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc63-compromise property, but rather the compromise property based on the minimal rights vector\ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc63).\nThe restricted proportionality property imposes zero-normalised games are assigned an allocation that is proportional to the utopia vector \ud835\udc40 (\ud835\udc63). This property originates from Tijs (1987) as well and it is satisfied by the \ud835\udf0f-value. On the other hand, the Shapley value is a solution concept that is efficient and satisfies the \ud835\udf08\ud835\udc63-compromise property, but it does not satisfy restricted proportionality."

            "heading": "4 Gately points and the Core for 3-player games",
            "text": "Gately (1974) introduced his solution concept as a Core selector within the setting of three-player games only, even though Gately did not investigate the exact conditions under which this solution is indeed in the Core. Littlechild and Vaidya (1976) point out that Gately\u2019s conception does not necessarily result in a Core selector for games with more than three players, devising a counterexample for 4 players.\nIn this section we first discuss the relationship between the Gately value and the Core for games with three players only. This is an exceptional case, since the worths of all coalitions in a three-player game are featured in the computation of the Gately value, in contrast to games with more than three players, in which worths of medium-sized coalitions are not considered. This is further explored in the second part of this section, which considers the relationship between the Gately value and the Core of cooperative games with an arbitrary number of players.\nWe are able to confirm that there is a strong relationship between Gately points and the Core in three-player games. We first illustrate that there exist essential games with empty Cores for which the unique Gately point is well-defined.\nExample 4.1 Consider an essential three-player game with \ud835\udc41 = {1, 2, 3} and \ud835\udc63 given by \ud835\udc631 = 5, \ud835\udc632 = \ud835\udc633 = 0, \ud835\udc63 (12) = \ud835\udc63 (13) = 1, \ud835\udc63 (23) = 5 and \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) = 6. First note that \ud835\udc63 is indeed essential, since \ud835\udc401(\ud835\udc63) = 1 and \ud835\udc402(\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udc403(\ud835\udc63) = 5. On the other hand, \ud835\udc63 is not semi-standard, since \ud835\udc631 = 5 > \ud835\udc401(\ud835\udc63) = 1. Note that the Core of this game is empty, since for an allocation \ud835\udc65 \u2208 A(\ud835\udc63) with \ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udc41 ) = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) = 6 and \ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc653 \u2a7e \ud835\udc63 (23) = 5 it follows that \ud835\udc651 \u2a7d 1. This is contradiction to the Core requirement that \ud835\udc651 \u2a7e \ud835\udc631 = 5. Regarding the existence of Gately points for this particular game, we note that the minimax optimisation problem can be re-stated here as the balance equation \ud835\udc401\u2212\ud835\udc631\n\ud835\udc651\u2212\ud835\udc631 = \ud835\udc402\u2212\ud835\udc632 \ud835\udc652\u2212\ud835\udc632 = \ud835\udc403\u2212\ud835\udc633 \ud835\udc653\u2212\ud835\udc633 resulting into\n\u22124 \ud835\udc651\u22125 = 5 \ud835\udc652 = 5 \ud835\udc653 , which leads to a unique Gately point \ud835\udc541 = 4 13 and \ud835\udc542 = \ud835\udc543 = 5 6 . Note that this unique Gately point can also be computed by the Gately value formula stated in equation (8). In comparison, the Shapley value of this game is given by \ud835\udf19 = ( 2 13 , 1 5 6 , 1 5 6 ) . \u2666\nThe next theorem gathers some properties of three-player games regarding the relationship between the Core and the Gately points of these games. These properties generalise the insights presented through the previous two examples.\nTheorem 4.2 Let \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 be a three-player game on \ud835\udc41 = {1, 2, 3}. Then the following properties hold:\n(a) If the game \ud835\udc63 is semi-regular, then the Gately value is in its Core, \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc63) \u2208 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) \u2260 \u2205.\n(b) If \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) \u2260 \u2205, then the game \ud835\udc63 is semi-regular and \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc63) \u2208 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63).\nProof. To show assertion (a), we first consider a three-player game \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 that is semi-regular, but not regular. Hence, \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 for \ud835\udc56 = 1, 2, 3, implying that \ud835\udc631 + \ud835\udc632 + \ud835\udc633 = \ud835\udc401(\ud835\udc63) +\ud835\udc402(\ud835\udc63) +\ud835\udc403(\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ). Simple computations show that there is a unique Core imputation given by \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) = { (\ud835\udc631, \ud835\udc632, \ud835\udc633) } = { (\ud835\udc401(\ud835\udc63), \ud835\udc402(\ud835\udc63), \ud835\udc403(\ud835\udc63) ) } \u2260 \u2205. Furthermore, it is easily established that the unique Gately point is well-defined and given by \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc63) = (\ud835\udc631, \ud835\udc632, \ud835\udc633) \u2208 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63).\nNext, we assume that \ud835\udc63 is regular in the sense that \ud835\udc631 + \ud835\udc632 + \ud835\udc633 \u2a7d \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2a7d \ud835\udc401(\ud835\udc63) +\ud835\udc402(\ud835\udc63) +\ud835\udc403(\ud835\udc63), \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 \u2a7d \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) for all \ud835\udc56 = 1, 2, 3 and, without loss of generality, \ud835\udc631 < \ud835\udc401(\ud835\udc63). Hence, it holds that \ud835\udc63 (12)+\ud835\udc63 (13)+\ud835\udc63 (23) \u2a7d 2\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ).

We check the conditions for \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc63) being a Core selector: First, for every \ud835\udc56 = 1, 2, 3 : \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc56 \u2a7e \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 ) = \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 . Second, we can check for each 2-player coalition the Core conditions. For {1, 2} it is easy to see that\n\ud835\udc541(\ud835\udc63) + \ud835\udc542(\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udc401(\ud835\udc63) +\ud835\udc402(\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udf021 \u2212 \ud835\udf022 = 2\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212 \ud835\udc63 (23) \u2212 \ud835\udc63 (13) \u2212 \ud835\udf021 \u2212 \ud835\udf022 = \ud835\udc63 (12) + \ud835\udf023 \u2a7e \ud835\udc63 (12)\nSimilar arguments show that \ud835\udc541(\ud835\udc63) + \ud835\udc543(\ud835\udc63) \u2a7e \ud835\udc63 (13) and \ud835\udc542(\ud835\udc63) + \ud835\udc543(\ud835\udc63) \u2a7e \ud835\udc63 (23). Together with \ud835\udc541(\ud835\udc63) + \ud835\udc542(\ud835\udc63) + \ud835\udc543(\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ), this completes the proof of assertion (a).\nTo show assertion (b), assume that for three-player game \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 with \ud835\udc41 = {1, 2, 3} it holds that \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) \u2260 \u2205. Hence, there exists some (\ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc652, \ud835\udc653) \u2208 R3 with \ud835\udc651 + \ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc653 = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ), \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 \u2a7e \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 for \ud835\udc56 = 1, 2, 3, and \ud835\udc651 + \ud835\udc652 \u2a7e \ud835\udc63 (12), \ud835\udc651 + \ud835\udc653 \u2a7e \ud835\udc63 (13), and \ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc653 \u2a7e \ud835\udc63 (23). Adding the last three inequalities results in the conclusion that\n2\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) = 2\ud835\udc651 + 2\ud835\udc652 + 2\ud835\udc653 \u2a7e \ud835\udc63 (12) + \ud835\udc63 (13) + \ud835\udc63 (23),\nwhich in turn leads to the conclusion that\n\ud835\udc401(\ud835\udc63) +\ud835\udc402(\ud835\udc63) +\ud835\udc403(\ud835\udc63) = (\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212 \ud835\udc63 (12)) + (\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212 \ud835\udc63 (13) + (\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212 \ud835\udc63 (23)) \u2a7e \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ).\nFurthermore, from \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 \u2a7e \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 for \ud835\udc56 = 1, 2, 3 it follows that \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) = \ud835\udc651 + \ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc653 \u2a7e \ud835\udc631 + \ud835\udc632 + \ud835\udc633. These two inequalities leads us to the conclusion that \ud835\udc631 + \ud835\udc632 + \ud835\udc633 \u2a7d \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2a7d \ud835\udc401(\ud835\udc63) +\ud835\udc402(\ud835\udc63) +\ud835\udc403(\ud835\udc63), implying that \ud835\udc63 is indeed essential. Furthermore, \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) = \ud835\udc651 + (\ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc653) \u2a7e \ud835\udc631 + \ud835\udc63 (23) implying that \ud835\udc401(\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212 \ud835\udc63 (23) \u2a7e \ud835\udc631. This argument can be replicated for players 2 and 3, leading to the desired conclusion that \ud835\udc63 is indeed semi-regular. The conclusion that, therefore, \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc63) \u2208 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) follows from assertion (a).\nAn immediate insight from Theorem 4.2 is that for every three-player game with a non-empty Core, the Gately value is a Core selector:\nCorollary 4.3 Let \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 with \ud835\udc41 = {1, 2, 3} be a three-player cooperative game. Then \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc63) \u2208 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) if and only \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) \u2260 \u2205.\nSimilar arguments as the ones used in the proof of Theorem 4.2(b) show that the Gately value of certain semi-regular three-player games is equal to the vector of marginal contributions and it is the unique Core imputation if the Core is non-empty.\nCorollary 4.4 Let \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 with \ud835\udc41 = {1, 2, 3} be a three-player cooperative game such that \ud835\udc63 is an essential cooperative game such that \ud835\udc63 (12) + \ud835\udc63 (13) + \ud835\udc63 (23) = 2\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ). Then the unique Gately point coincides with the Nucleolus of the game, being equal to the vector of marginal contributions \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc63) = N(\ud835\udc63) = (\ud835\udc401(\ud835\udc63), \ud835\udc402(\ud835\udc63), \ud835\udc403(\ud835\udc63) ). Furthermore, if \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) \u2260 \u2205, it holds that \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) = {\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc63)} = {N (\ud835\udc63)}.\nThe conclusions about the equivalence of the Gately value and the Nucleolus of the three-player game stated in Corollary 4.4 follows from application of Leng and Parlar (2010, Theorem 1) in case that \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) = \u2205.\n\ud835\udefc-Gately values and the Core of 3-player games The analysis of the relationship between \ud835\udefc-Gately values and the Core of a three-player game is more complex if we look beyond the standard Gately value (\ud835\udefc = 1).\nThe next example shows that there exist three-player games in which \ud835\udefc-Gately values are in the Core for a certain closed interval of \ud835\udefc values bounded away from zero.\nExample 4.5 Consider a zero-normalised three-player game \ud835\udc63 with \ud835\udc41 = {1, 2, 3} and \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 = 0 for \ud835\udc56 = 1, 2, 3, \ud835\udc63 (12) = 12, \ud835\udc63 (13) = \ud835\udc63 (23) = 7 and \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) = 16. Clearly, this game is regular. We easily compute that the marginal contributions are given by \ud835\udc401 = \ud835\udc402 = 7 and \ud835\udc403 = 4. For any \ud835\udefc > 0 we compute the \ud835\udefc-Gately values as\n\ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc1 (\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc2 (\ud835\udc63) = 8 \u00b7 7\ud835\udefc\n7\ud835\udefc + 2 \u00b7 4\ud835\udefc\u22121 and \ud835\udc54 \ud835\udefc 3 (\ud835\udc63) = 8 \u00b7 4\ud835\udefc 7\ud835\udefc + 2 \u00b7 4\ud835\udefc\u22121\nWe note that there are essentially two characteristic inequalities to determine whether the \ud835\udefc-Gately value in the Core of \ud835\udc63 :\n\ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc1 (\ud835\udc63) + \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc2 (\ud835\udc63) \u2a7e \ud835\udc63 (12) = 12 and \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc1 (\ud835\udc63) + \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc3 (\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc2 (\ud835\udc63) + \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc3 (\ud835\udc63) \u2a7e \ud835\udc63 (13) = \ud835\udc63 (23) = 7\nThe first inequality leads to the conclusion that \ud835\udefc \u2a7e ln 3\u2212ln 2ln 7\u2212ln 4 \u2248 0.7245 and the second inequality results in \ud835\udefc \u2a7d ln 7\u2212ln 2ln 7\u2212ln 4 \u2248 2.2386. Hence, the range of \ud835\udefc values for which the \ud835\udefc-Gately value is in the Core of this game is given by \ud835\udefc \u2208 [ ln 3\u2212ln 2 ln 7\u2212ln 4 , ln 7\u2212ln 2 ln 7\u2212ln 4 ] . Note that \ud835\udefc = 1 is indeed in this interval, i.e., \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc63) \u2208 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63). The Shapley value of this game is computed as\ud835\udf19 = ( 5 12 , 5 1 2 , 3 ) = \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc\n\u2022 (\ud835\udc63) \u2208 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) with \ud835\udefc\u2022 = ln 13\u2212ln 6ln 7\u2212ln 4 \u2248 1.38164. Finally, we remark that the Nucleolus of this game is given by N = (7, 7, 2) = \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc\u25e6 (\ud835\udc63) \u2208 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) with \ud835\udefc\u25e6 = ln 7\u2212ln 2ln 7\u2212ln 4 , which is a corner point of the Core. \u2666\nThe next example considers a game with a large set of imputations and a minimal Core, consisting of a single imputation. For this example we show that the original Gately value is the only Core selector, while all \ud835\udefc-Gately values for \ud835\udefc \u2260 1 are outside the Core.\nExample 4.6 Consider a regular three-player game with \ud835\udc41 = {1, 2, 3} and \ud835\udc63 given by \ud835\udc631 = \ud835\udc632 = \ud835\udc633 = 0, \ud835\udc63 (12) = 5, \ud835\udc63 (13) = 6, \ud835\udc63 (23) = 7 and \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) = 9. Note that I(\ud835\udc63) = {\ud835\udc65 \u2208 R3+ | \u2211 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 = 9} and that the Core is a singleton with \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) = { (2, 3, 4) } = {\ud835\udc40 (\ud835\udc63) }. We note that for this game \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udc40 (\ud835\udc63) selects the unique Core imputation. However, for all \ud835\udefc > 0 with \ud835\udefc \u2260 1 we have that\n\ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc (\ud835\udc63) = 9 2\ud835\udefc + 3\ud835\udefc + 4\ud835\udefc ( 2 \ud835\udefc , 3\ud835\udefc , 4\ud835\udefc ) \u2260 (2, 3, 4) .\nNote that \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc (\ud835\udc63) \u2192 (3, 3, 3) as \ud835\udefc \u2193 0 and \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc (\ud835\udc63) \u2192 (0, 0, 9) as \ud835\udefc \u2192 \u221e. This convergence is not monotone as one would possibly expect, since \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc2 (\ud835\udc63) attains a maximal value of \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc2 (\ud835\udc63) \u2248 3.0291 at \ud835\udefc = 1ln 2 ln [ ln 3\u2212ln 2 ln 4\u2212ln 3 ] \u2248 0.4951. The results of the analysis of this example are summarised in Figure 1. The yellow simplex represents the space of imputations I(\ud835\udc63), while the Core is the unique imputation depicted as a blue point. The red curve denotes the set of \ud835\udefc-Gately values, {\ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc (\ud835\udc63) | \ud835\udefc > 0}. Finally, we compute the Shapley value as \ud835\udf19 = ( 3 12 , 3 , 2 1 2 ) \u2209 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63), which cannot be expressed as a proper \ud835\udefc-Gately value. \u2666"

The next example illustrates the issues of the questions we investigate here.10\nExample 5.1 Consider a regular zero-normalised four-player game \ud835\udc63 with \ud835\udc41 = {1, 2, 3, 4} and \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 = 0 for all \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 , \ud835\udc63 (12) = 8, \ud835\udc63 (13) = \ud835\udc63 (14) = \ud835\udc63 (23) = \ud835\udc63 (24) = \ud835\udc63 (34) = 1, \ud835\udc63 (123) = \ud835\udc63 (124) = 5, \ud835\udc63 (134) = \ud835\udc63 (234) = 4, and \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) = 12. We note that the Core of this game is non-empty, since( 4 12 , 4 1 2 , 1 1 2 , 1 1 2 ) \u2208 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63). From these worths, we derive that \ud835\udc40 (\ud835\udc63) = (4, 4, 3, 3). From this it is easy to establish that the Gately value of this game is given by \ud835\udc54 = ( 3 37 , 3 3 7 , 2 4 7 , 2 4 7 ) . Clearly, \ud835\udc54 \u2209 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) since \ud835\udc541+\ud835\udc542 = 6 67 < \ud835\udc63 (12) = 8.\n10We remark that Littlechild and Vaidya (1976) already provided an example of a four-player game in which the Gately value is not in the non-empty Core of that game.\nFinally, we determine that the Shapley value of this game is given by \ud835\udf19 = ( 3 34 , 3 3 4 , 2 1 4 , 2 1 4 ) \u2209 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63). Note that \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc63) \u2260 \ud835\udf19 (\ud835\udc63). \u2666\nIn the following analysis we particularly focus on the conditions on \ud835\udc5b-player games under which \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc63) \u2208 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) and/or \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udf19 (\ud835\udc63). We establish some full characterisations of these equivalences."

            "text": "The main condition for which a \u201csymmetric\u201d or \u201canonymous\u201d cooperative game has a non-empty Core has been identified as the condition that for all coalitions \ud835\udc46 \u2208 2\ud835\udc41 : \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46 )|\ud835\udc46 | \u2a7d \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \ud835\udc5b\n(Shubik, 1982, page 149). This condition has been referred to as \u201cdomination by the grand coalition\u201d by Chatterjee et al. (1993) and as \u201ctop convexity\u201d by Jackson and van den Nouweland (2005). We generalise this condition to identify when the \ud835\udefc-Gately value is in the Core of a regular, zero-normalised cooperative game.\nDefinition 5.2 Let \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 be a semi-standard cooperative game and let \ud835\udefc > 0.

(16)\nFor \ud835\udefc = 1 we refer to the started property as \u201ctop dominance\u201d. First we remark that \u2211 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc46 ( \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 )\ud835\udefc \u2a7e 0 for every semi-standard cooperative game \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 and every \ud835\udefc > 0. Furthermore, the concept of \ud835\udefc-top dominance is akin to the notions listed above in the sense that for a semi-standard zero-normalised game \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc410 , property (16) can be rewritten as\n\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46)\u2211 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc63)\ud835\udefc \u2a7d \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 )\u2211 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc63)\ud835\udefc\nfor \u2211 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc63)\ud835\udefc \u2a7e \u2211\n\ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc63)\ud835\udefc > 0. Moreover, implementing\ud835\udefc = 0, the notion of\ud835\udefc-top dominance clearly generalises the notion of top convexity, as top convexity is equivalent to 0-top dominance for zero-normalised games. Indeed, for zero-normalised game \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc410 we straightforwardly derive\u2211\n\ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc40 0 \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc63) = |\ud835\udc46 |, immediately leading to the conclusion that 0-top dominance is the same as top\nconvexity. The next theorem generalises the insights of Theorem 4.2 to games with arbitrary player sets.\nTheorem 5.3 Let \ud835\udefc > 0. A standard cooperative game \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 is \ud835\udefc-top dominant if and only if \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc (\ud835\udc63) \u2208 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63). Proof. Let \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 be standard and let \ud835\udefc > 0. Now \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc (\ud835\udc63) \u2208 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) if and only if it holds that for every coalition \ud835\udc46 \u2208 2\ud835\udc41 : \u2211\ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc63) \u2a7e \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46). This is equivalent to the condition that for every coalition \ud835\udc46 \u2208 2\ud835\udc41 :\n\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 + \u2211 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc46 (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 )\ud835\udefc\u2211 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 ( \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 )\ud835\udefc \u00b7 (\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 ) \u2a7e \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46)\nFrom \ud835\udc63 being standard, it follows that \u2211\n\ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 )\ud835\udefc > 0. Hence, the above is equivalent to the condition that for every coalition \ud835\udc46 \u2208 2\ud835\udc41 :\n\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc46 (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 )\ud835\udefc \u00b7 ( \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 ) \u2a7e \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 ( \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 )\ud835\udefc \u00b7 (\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46) \u2212 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 ) This is exactly the \ud835\udefc-top dominance property.\nProperties of top dominant games The next definition introduces a reduced notion of superadditivity that fits with top dominance. This form of superadditivity is defined as \u201cpartitional\u201d superadditivity.\nDefinition 5.4 A cooperative game \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 is partitionally superadditive if for every coalition \ud835\udc46 \u2286 \ud835\udc41 it holds that \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46) + \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 \\ \ud835\udc46) \u2a7d \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ).\nThe next theorem shows that top dominant games always satisfy regularity as well as the partitional superadditivity property defined above.\nTheorem 5.5 Let \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 be a standard cooperative game. If the game \ud835\udc63 is \ud835\udefc-top dominant for some \ud835\udefc > 0, then \ud835\udc63 is regular as well as partitionally superadditive.\nProof. Let \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 be a standard game and let \ud835\udefc > 0 be such that \ud835\udc63 is \ud835\udefc-top dominant. Hence,\u2211 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 ( \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc63 ( \ud835\udc57) \u2212 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 )\ud835\udefc > 0 and \u2211 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc46 ( \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc63 ( \ud835\udc57) \u2212 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 )\ud835\udefc \u2a7e 0 for every coalition \ud835\udc46 \u2282 \ud835\udc41 .\nWe first show that \ud835\udc63 is essential, together with the hypothesis that \ud835\udc63 is standard, implying that \ud835\udc63 is regular. When we apply the \ud835\udefc-top dominance property to the coalition \ud835\udc41 \u2212 \ud835\udc56 for any \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 we arrive at(\n\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 \u2212 \ud835\udc56) \u2212 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2260\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 ) \u00b7 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 ( \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc63 ( \ud835\udc57) \u2212 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 )\ud835\udefc \u2a7d ( \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 ) \u00b7 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2260\ud835\udc56 ( \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc63 ( \ud835\udc57) \u2212 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 )\ud835\udefc Adding these inequalities over all \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 we arrive at the conclusion that\n\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 ( \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 \u2212 \ud835\udc56) \u2212 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2260\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 ) \u00b7 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 ( \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc63 ( \ud835\udc57) \u2212 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 )\ud835\udefc \u2a7d ( \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 ) \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2260\ud835\udc56 ( \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc63 ( \ud835\udc57) \u2212 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 )\ud835\udefc = (\ud835\udc5b \u2212 1) ( \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212\n\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 ) \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 ( \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc63 ( \ud835\udc57) \u2212 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 )\ud835\udefc Hence,\n\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 ( \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 \u2212 \ud835\udc56) \u2212 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2260\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 ) \u2a7d (\ud835\udc5b \u2212 1) ( \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 ) leading to the conclusion that\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 [\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212 \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 \u2212 \ud835\udc56) ] \u2212 \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212 (\ud835\udc5b \u2212 1) \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 \u2a7e \u2212(\ud835\udc5b \u2212 1) \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 .\nThis implies that\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2a7e \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ). (17)\nNext, suppose to the contrary that \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) < \u2211\ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 . From \ud835\udc63 being a standard game, there is some \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 with \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) > \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 .

Then, from \ud835\udefc-top dominance, it holds for \ud835\udc46 that(\n\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46) \u2212 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 ) \u00b7 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 )\ud835\udefc \u2a7d ( \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 ) \u00b7 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc46 (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 )\ud835\udefc\n\u00a9\u00ab\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 \\ \ud835\udc46) \u2212 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \\\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 \u00aa\u00ae\u00ac \u00b7 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 )\ud835\udefc \u2a7d ( \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 ) \u00b7 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 \\\ud835\udc46 (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 )\ud835\udefc\nAdding these two inequalities leads to the conclusion that( \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46) + \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 \\ \ud835\udc46) \u2212 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 ) \u00b7 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 )\ud835\udefc \u2a7d ( \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 ) \u00b7 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 )\ud835\udefc\nSince \u2211\n\ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc41 (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 )\ud835\udefc > 0 for any \ud835\udefc > 0, we have shown that\n\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46) + \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 \\ \ud835\udc46) \u2212 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 \u2a7d \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57\nand, hence, \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46) + \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 \\ \ud835\udc46) \u2a7d \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ). We conclude that \ud835\udc63 is indeed partitionally superadditive.\nTheorems 5.5 and 5.3 now immediately imply the following corollary.\nCorollary 5.6 Let \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 be a standard cooperative game and let \ud835\udefc > 0. If \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc (\ud835\udc63) \u2208 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63), then \ud835\udc63 is regular and partitionally superadditive.\nOne can ask oneself whether the condition of top dominance can be simplified or linked to other regularity properties of cooperative games. As shown in Theorem 5.5 it is clear that top dominance is closely related to the superadditivity property that is widely used in cooperative game theory. The next example shows that top dominance is actually strictly weaker than superadditivity.\nExample 5.7 Consider a regular and zero-normalised three-player game with \ud835\udc41 = {1, 2, 3} and \ud835\udc63 given by \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 = 0 for \ud835\udc56 = 1, 2, 3, \ud835\udc63 (12) = \ud835\udc63 (13) = \u22121, \ud835\udc63 (23) = 0 and \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) = 1. We note that \ud835\udc63 is not\nsuperadditive, since \ud835\udc631 + \ud835\udc632 = 0 > \ud835\udc63 (12) = \u22121. However, for any \ud835\udefc > 0 we remark that\n\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \ud835\udc401(\ud835\udc63)\ud835\udefc +\ud835\udc402(\ud835\udc63)\ud835\udefc +\ud835\udc403(\ud835\udc63)\ud835\udefc = 1 1 + 2\ud835\udefc+1 > 0\n\ud835\udc63 (12) \ud835\udc401(\ud835\udc63)\ud835\udefc +\ud835\udc402(\ud835\udc63)\ud835\udefc = \u22121 1 + 2\ud835\udefc < 0 \ud835\udc63 (13) \ud835\udc401(\ud835\udc63)\ud835\udefc +\ud835\udc403(\ud835\udc63)\ud835\udefc = \u22121 1 + 2\ud835\udefc < 0 \ud835\udc63 (23) \ud835\udc402(\ud835\udc63)\ud835\udefc +\ud835\udc403(\ud835\udc63)\ud835\udefc = 0\nHence, we conclude that \ud835\udc63 indeed satisfies \ud835\udefc-top dominance for every \ud835\udefc > 0. Furthermore, we determine easily that \ud835\udc401(\ud835\udc63) = 1 and \ud835\udc402(\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udc403(\ud835\udc63) = 2, leading to the conclusion that for every \ud835\udefc > 0 the Gately values are given as \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc1 = 1 1+2\ud835\udefc+1 and \ud835\udc54 \ud835\udefc 2 = \ud835\udc54 \ud835\udefc 3 = 2\ud835\udefc 1+2\ud835\udefc+1 . It can also easily be checked that for every \ud835\udefc > 0 : \ud835\udc54\ud835\udefc (\ud835\udc63) \u2208 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63). \u2666"

            "heading": "5.2 Comparing the Gately and Shapley values",
            "text": "The Shapley value (Shapley, 1953) has achieved the status as being the prime solution concept for TU-games. It sets a benchmark for assessing the suitability of alternative solution concepts. In this context it is suitable to consider for what classes of TU-games such alternative solution concepts lead to exactly the same allocation as the Shapley value. We pursue that here for the Gately solution concept.\nWe show that the Shapley and Gately values coincide on narrow, but highly relevant, classes of games that satisfy rather strong regularity properties. Theorem 5.9 below identifies a class of structured games that have rather wide applicability. This class is founded on strong conditions on the class of constituting coalitions and the corresponding unanimity games\nWe recall for the benefit of the next analysis that all cooperative games can be represented through the unanimity basis of V\ud835\udc41 . For every coalition \ud835\udc46 \u2208 2\ud835\udc41 we define the \ud835\udc46-unanimity game \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc46 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 by\n\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc46 (\ud835\udc47 ) =  1 if \ud835\udc46 \u2286 \ud835\udc47 0 otherwise\nNow, every game \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 can be written as \ud835\udc63 = \u2211\ud835\udc46\u2208\u03a0\ud835\udc63 \u0394\ud835\udc46 (\ud835\udc63) \u00b7 \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc46 , where \u03a0\ud835\udc63 = {\ud835\udc46 \u2208 2\ud835\udc41 | \u0394\ud835\udc46 (\ud835\udc63) \u2260 0} is the class of relevant constituting coalitions with \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc46 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 being the corresponding \ud835\udc46-unanimity game for the constituting coalition \ud835\udc46 \u2208 \u03a0\ud835\udc63 and \u0394\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46) \u2260 0 the corresponding Harsanyi dividend of coalition \ud835\udc46 in game \ud835\udc63 (Harsanyi, 1959).\nWe also recall that for any game \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 with corresponding representation \ud835\udc63 = \u2211\ud835\udc46\u2208\u03a0\ud835\udc63 \u0394\ud835\udc46 (\ud835\udc63) \u00b7\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc46 , the Shapley value of \ud835\udc63 is defined as \ud835\udf19 (\ud835\udc63) \u2208 R\ud835\udc41 given by\n\ud835\udf19\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) = \u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc46\u22082\ud835\udc41 : \ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc46\n\u0394\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46) |\ud835\udc46 | for every \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 . (18)\nThe next definition introduces some relevant classes of regular games.\nDefinition 5.8 Let \ud835\udc41 = {1, . . . , \ud835\udc5b} be a set of players and let \ud835\udc58 \u2208 {2, . . . , \ud835\udc5b \u2212 1}. A game \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 on \ud835\udc41 is denoted as a k-game if \ud835\udc63 is regular and \ud835\udc63 can be written as \ud835\udc63 = \u2211\n\ud835\udc46\u2208\u03a0\ud835\udc63 \u0394\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46) \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc46 , where \u03a0\ud835\udc63 = {\ud835\udc46 \u2208 2\ud835\udc41 | \u0394\ud835\udc46 (\ud835\udc63) \u2260 0}, such that |\ud835\udc46 | = \ud835\udc58 for all constituting coalitions \ud835\udc46 \u2208 \u03a0\ud835\udc63 . The subclass of \ud835\udc58-games on \ud835\udc41 is denoted by V\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc58 \u2282 V\ud835\udc41 .\nThe subclass of 2-games has been investigated in the literature on its properties. In particular, van den Nouweland et al. (1996) and van den Brink et al. (2023) show that for 2-games the Shapley value coincides with the Nucleolus and the \ud835\udf0f-value. It might not be a surprise that we can show for all subclasses of \ud835\udc58-games the property that the Gately value coincides with the Shapley value.\nTheorem 5.9 Let \ud835\udc41 = {1, . . . , \ud835\udc5b} be a set of players and let \ud835\udc58 \u2208 {2, . . . , \ud835\udc5b \u2212 1}. For every \ud835\udc58-game \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc58 it holds that \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udf19 (\ud835\udc63).\nProof. Let \ud835\udc41 = {1, . . . , \ud835\udc5b} be a set of players and let \ud835\udc58 \u2208 {2, . . . , \ud835\udc5b \u2212 1}. First, we remark that all \ud835\udc58-games are zero-normalised by definition. Now, let \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc58 be a \ud835\udc58-game. Hence, |\ud835\udc46 | = \ud835\udc58 for all\n\ud835\udc46 \u2208 \u03a0\ud835\udc63 . Assume that |\u03a0\ud835\udc63 | =\ud835\udc5a is the number of the constituting coalitions of the game \ud835\udc63 . Next, we introduce some additional notation. For every \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 we let \u03a0\ud835\udc56 = {\ud835\udc46 \u2208 \u03a0\ud835\udc63 | \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc46}. Then the Shapley value of player \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 can be written as\n\ud835\udf19\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) = \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc46\u2208\u03a0\ud835\udc56 \u0394\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46) |\ud835\udc46 | = 1 \ud835\udc58 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc46\u2208\u03a0\ud835\udc56 \u0394\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46) = \u0394\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc58\nwhere \u0394\ud835\udc56 = \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc46\u2208\u03a0\ud835\udc56 \u0394\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46).\nRegarding the determination of the Gately value, we note that the marginal contribution of \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 is now given by\n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u2212 \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 \u2212 \ud835\udc56) = \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc46\u2208\u03a0\ud835\udc63 \u0394\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46) \u2212 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc46\u2208\u03a0\ud835\udc63 : \ud835\udc56\u2209\ud835\udc46 \u0394\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46) = \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc46\u2208\u03a0\ud835\udc56 \u0394\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46) = \u0394\ud835\udc56 .\nFurthermore, this implies that \u2211 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) = \u2211\n\ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \u0394 \ud835\udc57 = \ud835\udc58 \u00b7 \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ). Hence, we have determined that for \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 :\n\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63)\u2211\n\ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc63) \u00b7 \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) = \u0394\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc58 \u00b7 \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) \u00b7 \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) = \u0394\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc58 = \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63).\nThis shows the assertion of the theorem.\nBased on Theorem 1 and Corollary 1 of van den Brink et al. (2023) in combination with Theorem 5.9, we can determine another characterisation of the Gately value for the subclass of 2-games:\nCorollary 5.10 On the subclass of 2-games V\ud835\udc412 , the Gately value is the unique value that satisfies the balanced externalities property in the sense that for every \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc412 with \ud835\udc63 = \u2211 \ud835\udc46\u2208\u03a0\ud835\udc63 \u0394\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46) \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc46 :\n\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) = \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57\u2260\ud835\udc56 ( \ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc63) \u2212 \ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc63\u2212\ud835\udc56) ) (19)\nwhere \ud835\udc63\u2212\ud835\udc56 = \u2211\n\ud835\udc47 \u2208\u03a0\u2212\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63 \u0394\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc47 ) \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc47 where \u03a0 \u2212\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc63 = {\ud835\udc47 \u2208 \u03a0\ud835\udc63 | \ud835\udc56 \u2209 \ud835\udc47 }.\nThe reverse of Theorem 5.9 does not hold. There are other classes of games with strong regularity properties that are not \ud835\udc58-games and on which the Gately value coincides with the Shapley value. The next proposition introduces such a subclass of highly regular games.\nProposition 5.11 Let \ud835\udc63 \u2208 V\ud835\udc41 be a regular game written as \ud835\udc63 = \u2211\ud835\udc46\u2208\u03a0\ud835\udc63 \u0394\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46) \ud835\udc62\ud835\udc46 . Assume that\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc58 \u00b7\ud835\udc5a, where \ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc5a \u2208 N with \ud835\udc58 \u2260\ud835\udc5a, such that \u03a0\ud835\udc63 = \u03a0\ud835\udc58 \u228e \u03a0\ud835\udc5a , where \u03a0\ud835\udc58 is a partitioning of \ud835\udc41 into\ud835\udc5a sets of size \ud835\udc58 and \u03a0\ud835\udc5a is a partitioning of \ud835\udc41 into \ud835\udc58 sets of size\ud835\udc5a. If there exists some \u0394 \u2260 0 such that \u0394\ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc46) = \u0394 for all \ud835\udc46 \u2208 \u03a0\ud835\udc63 , then \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udf19 (\ud835\udc63).\nProof. Let \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 be an arbitrary player. Due to the structure of the game, player \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 is member of exactly one coalition \ud835\udc46 \u2208 \u03a0\ud835\udc58 and one coalition \ud835\udc47 \u2208 \u03a0\ud835\udc5a . Hence, it easily follows that \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) = \u0394\ud835\udc58 + \u0394 \ud835\udc5a\n. To compute the Gately value, we note that \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) = 2\u0394 and \u2211 \ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc63) = \ud835\udc5b \u00b7 2\u0394 = 2\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5a\u0394. Furthermore, \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) = (\ud835\udc58 +\ud835\udc5a)\u0394, so the Gately value for player \ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 can be computed as\n\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63) = 2\u0394 2\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5a\u0394 (\ud835\udc58 +\ud835\udc5a)\u0394 = \ud835\udc58 +\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5a \u0394 = \u0394 \ud835\udc58 + \u0394 \ud835\udc5a = \u03a6\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc63).\nThis shows the assertion.\nFor games that do not satisfy the property stated in Theorem 5.9, the Gately value is only very rarely equal to the Shapley value. The next example discusses a convex five-player game in which the Gately value is not in the Core, while the Shapley value is a Core selector (Shapley, 1971).\nExample 5.12 Let \ud835\udc41 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and let \ud835\udc63 = \ud835\udc6212 + 3\ud835\udc62345. This game is convex with \ud835\udc63 (\ud835\udc41 ) = 4 and the marginal contribution vector \ud835\udc40 = (1, 1, 3, 3, 3). It is easy to see that the Shapley value is given by \ud835\udf19 = ( 1 2 , 1 2 , 1, 1, 1 ) and the Gately value is given by \ud835\udc54 = ( 4 11 , 4 11 , 12 11 , 12 11 , 12 11 ) . We note that \ud835\udf19 \u2208 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63), while \ud835\udc54 \u2209 \ud835\udc36 (\ud835\udc63) since \ud835\udc541 + \ud835\udc542 = 811 < 1 = \ud835\udc63 (12). We remark that the game \ud835\udc63 discussed here does not satisfy either of the descriptions introduced in Theorem 5.9 and Proposition 5.11, but that the game has a structure that is similar to the structure of the class of games considered in Proposition 5.11. \u2666"
