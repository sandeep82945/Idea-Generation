    "abstractText": "The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine, and particularly in radiology, is becoming increasingly prominent. Its impact will transform the way the specialty is practiced and the current and future education model. The aim of this study is to analyze the perception that undergraduate medical students have about the current situation of AI in medicine, especially in radiology. A survey with 17 items was distributed to medical students between 3 January to 31 March 2022. Two hundred and eighty-one students correctly responded the questionnaire; 79.3% of them claimed that they knew what AI is. However, their objective knowledge about AI was low but acceptable. Only 24.9% would choose radiology as a specialty, and only 40% of them as one of their first three options. The applications of this technology were valued positively by most students, who give it an important Support Role, without fear that the radiologist will be replaced by AI (79.7%). The majority (95.7%) agreed with the need to implement well-established ethical principles in AI, and 80% valued academic training in AI positively. Surveyed medical students have a basic understanding of AI and perceive it as a useful tool that will transform radiology.",

            "text": "The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in all fields of medicine and, particularly, in radiology, is gaining more and more importance. Its scope will transform the way of medical practice, as well as the education model for the future. In many cases, the performance of health professionals will depend on the proper knowledge and use of AI, which is expected to lead to the provision of quality health care, based on precision medicine, comprehensive diagnosis and personalized prognosis for the benefit of the patient. The concept of AI has been in continuous evolution because of the development and interactions between the different systems that compose it. In the context of medical activity, AI means the development and use of algorithms and software techniques that can interpret medical data, in order to learn from them, adapt and improve their performance through this experience, and thus helping increase patient safety and reducing the direct workload of professionals [1\u20136]. Its applications in radiology are multiple and can range from scheduling appointments to patients [7] and selecting imaging protocols for optimal radiation doses [8], to other different tasks that have to do with image processing (reconstructions, quality improvements, lesion detection, measurements, organ segmentation, documentation) [9,10]. The COVID-19 pandemic has given a boost to the research sector, favoring the integration of this technology in digital radiology [11]. Its applications in computed tomography/ X-ray of the thorax seem to bring the moment of its introduction in the clinical routine [12,13]. New hybrid networks have been investigated, a combination of machine learning (ML) and DL (deep learning), which will allow prediction of the survival or\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 1589. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20021589 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph\nseverity of the diseases by integrating the characteristics of the lesions with the clinical and laboratory data of the patients, a discipline which is still under investigation [9,14,15]. The use of radiomic models, which use advanced ML approaches and imaging characteristics, for example, magnetic resonance imaging, are methods that are beginning to be spread, because they are simple and non-invasive, and may help in diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making, and in personalizing them, such as in prostate cancer [16]. Other models correlate different imaging studies (CT, PET) with data (proteomics, genomics, liquid biopsy, etc.) that help predict prognosis and response to treatment [2,17]. Despite the efficacy demonstrated by AI in some specific tasks, the radiologist\u2019s work is far from being replaced globally [18]. It is believed that the model that will prevail will be the use of this technology as support [19,20], for which communication and joint work with other professionals such as engineers and computer scientists [21], and their adequate training, will be crucial. AI will have a positive impact on the work of radiologists, since they will not only be seen as image interpreters, but will also lead the algorithm validation process and contribute their experience in the global clinical approach to patients, obtaining greater relevance and visibility. Few studies have been carried out in recent years addressing the need for AI education for both students and residents, as well as medical specialists. There seems to be a generalized and growing consensus to continue training radiologists who incorporate new knowledge and skills in said technologies, and that this training should begin in the university phase, be consolidated in residency and continue as part of continuous training throughout the profession [19,22,23]. There are many training programs offered by a wide range of institutions, but they are often occasional, short, and not integrated into the radiologists\u2019 learning path. The fact that AI training is only recently emerging creates a significant gap between what these programs offer and what radiologists need to learn [24,25]. What is clear is the need for adequate training that includes the use, benefits, challenges and issues related to the implementation of AI in clinical departments to ensure that it increases the confidence of clinicians interested in these careers [26]. Students should be engaged in practical exercises with real applications of AI and learn to use it effectively and critically in their work, in the same way that younger radiologists should be supported by programs that allow them to strategically design and develop their professional career for the future [24]. Thus, the principal aim of this study is to analyze medical students\u2019 perception about the current situation of AI in medicine, especially in radiology. Secondly, and in a complementary way, other objectives would be:\n1. To check the general knowledge that students have about AI. 2. To assess the importance given by students to academic training in AI. 3. To determine the influence of AI on human decision-making and capabilities, as well as the need for the implementation of well-established ethical principles. 4. To investigate the role assigned to the use of AI in radiology and its impact on the\nprofessional performance of specialists and radiology services."

Theoretical: A review of the subject to be investigated was accomplished through different search engines such as: PubMed, Scopus, Dialnet and Google Scholar. Articles from the last 5 years were included, limiting the references to our objectives using the keywords: artificial intelligence; medicine; radiology; students; perception; ethics. 2. Empirical: The tool used was an anonymous online questionnaire (Supplementary Materials), carried out through the Google Forms platform to high school and university Medical students in Santiago de Compostela during the 2021\u20132022 academic year. The distribution of the survey was made through the class delegates in the Faculty of Medicine and through the directors of the institutes. It was open from 3 January to 31 March 2022.\nThe questionnaire consisted of 17 items including multiple choice questions, true/false questions, and 5-point Likert scale items. Questions tried to address the following main topics: (1) Demographics (sex, age, current course, and institution) (2) Ranking radiology specialty with or without the consideration of AI (3) Assessment of their confidence in and understanding of AI (4) Sources of information on AI (5) AI and ethics (6) Asses their opinion about teaching the basis of AI in universities (7) Perception of the impact of AI in radiology. The questionnaire was conducted as an empirical basis for two different research projects. One sought to analyze the perception of AI in high school students, and another in medical students. For this reason, the total sample size was 402 respondents, of which the data of the high school students (n = 119) were not included in this study, as our objective was to seek medical students\u2019 perceptions. Thus, the statistical analysis was performed on the responses of the University Degree in Medicine group (N = 283). Participation was voluntary and had no relation to the student\u2019s curricular activities. Informed consent was confirmed when a respondent agreed to start the online survey. Each participant was informed that their data would be anonymous, statistically analyzed and used for scientific publication. Data analysis was performed with the statistical analysis software R for Mac (4.1.2) with R Studio. First, a descriptive analysis of the data was carried out using absolute and relative frequencies. Likert responses were converted to ordinal data by assigning the following values: strongly disagree = 1; disagree = 2; neither agree/nor disagree = 3; agree = 4; and strongly agree = 5. They were treated as ordinal data, using percentages to analyze them, and using the ggplot2 and likert packages of R to plot them.\nAge did not follow a normal distribution. Next, it was verified how the variables age and sex influenced the results (the chi-\nsquare test and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test were performed as appropriate). Likewise, comparisons were made between some of the rest of the variables. A p-value <0.05 was regarded as statistically significant."

The majority of respondents (95.73%) in this study were in favor of the need for the implementation of well-established ethical principles in AI. This point has not been explored in the studies analyzed, despite the repercussion that the impact of AI has. It would be convenient that, with a view to the future, questions of this type were incorporated, in order to compare the perception between different population groups in this regard. A significant number of students (80%) positively valued academic training in AI. Most of the studies reviewed agree on this point, as respondents believe that teaching AI will be beneficial for their career and agree to include it as part of their study program [27\u201334]. The fact of not receiving education in the use of new technologies could affect students,\nwhen choosing radiology or not, feeling prepared to work with them at the end of their degree [28]. The applications of this technology are valued positively by the majority of students, who give it an important support role. Approximately half of the students surveyed see AI as a useful tool that improves human capabilities, despite affecting our autonomy by interfering with decision-making. According to a UK study, 88% of its students believed that it will play an important role in the medical care of the future and 48.3% believed that certain specialties will be replaced (36), while others believed that AI will revolutionize radiology, as in the case of the German article (77.2%) or ours (90.74%) [27,31]. For 66% of American students, AI will have a profound impact on medicine in general and especially radiology [32]. In turn, 87.7% of the students surveyed by Gal\u00e1n and Portero in 2021 said that \u201cadvances in AI will improve the workload capacity and efficiency of radiologists, constituting a very useful complement to their work\u201d [27]. A large number of students (79.72%) considered that the rise of AI could not replace radiologists. The vast majority of those surveyed felt that the way radiologists work would change. Respondents from the German and Spanish studies, for the most part, stated that it will not replace doctors but that in the case of radiology it could be seen as a good competitor [27,31]. Just over half of Saudi and Canadian students did not agree with AI replacing radiologists, and 44.8% and 67.7%, respectively, believe that in the future the number of these specialists will be reduced by AI [29,30]. A total of 90.2% of Canadian students stated that radiologists should adopt AI and work with the IT industry for its application; on the other hand, they agreed with the view of \u201cdisplacement\u201d, due to greater efficiency with the increase of the AI [29]. As the greatest drawback of the use of AI in medicine, the respondents pointed out the inability to interpret the patient in a global clinical context, followed by the high cost of its implementation, the possible vulnerability of the right to privacy of patients and the necessary training in the management of AI for professionals. All the studies believe that it would be necessary to have training in AI both at the student and professional level. German respondents stated that AI could potentially detect pathologies in radiological examinations (83%), but it could not establish a definitive diagnosis (56%) [31], for which the role of the radiologist is vital. Although the results obtained in the research were fruitful, it is necessary to mention a limitation was found as far as the study sample is concerned: the size is relatively small if we take into account the number of medical students in Spain, and the origin, almost in its entirety, is from one university (USC). It is recommended to carry out new studies with samples from other universities, which include other questions that allow a better assessment of the perception that students have on the subject. In addition, emphasizing the need to train students in AI, including it as a subject in the degree\u2019s study plan, as well as encouraging the choice of specialty in classes and providing it with a greater presence in clinical practice rotations will also be important."
