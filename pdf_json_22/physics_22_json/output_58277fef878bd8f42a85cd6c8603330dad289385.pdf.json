    "abstractText": "The Standard Model can be defined quantitatively by running parameters in a mass-independent renormalization scheme at a fixed reference scale. We provide a set of simple interpolation formulas that give the fundamental Lagrangian parameters in the MS scheme at a renormalization scale of 200 GeV, safely above the top-quark mass and suitable for matching to candidate new physics models at very high mass scales using renormalization group equations. These interpolation formulas take as inputs the on-shell experimental quantities and use the best available calculations in the pure MS scheme. They also serve as an accounting of the parametric uncertainties for the short-distance Standard Model Lagrangian. We also include an interpolating formula for the W-boson mass. This paper is based on results obtained with the publicly available computer program SMDR.",

Martin Department of Physics, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois 60115, USA\n(Received 29 November 2022; accepted 10 January 2023; published 30 January 2023)\nThe Standard Model can be defined quantitatively by running parameters in a mass-independent renormalization scheme at a fixed reference scale. We provide a set of simple interpolation formulas that give the fundamental Lagrangian parameters in the MS scheme at a renormalization scale of 200 GeV, safely above the top-quark mass and suitable for matching to candidate new physics models at very high mass scales using renormalization group equations. These interpolation formulas take as inputs the on-shell experimental quantities and use the best available calculations in the pure MS scheme. They also serve as an accounting of the parametric uncertainties for the short-distance Standard Model Lagrangian. We also include an interpolating formula for the W-boson mass. This paper is based on results obtained with the publicly available computer program SMDR.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.107.013010\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe Standard Model of fundamental particle physics has reached a high level of experimental maturity with the 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson and the increasingly accurate measurements of its mass, production modes, and decays. Meanwhile, the explorations of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the high-energy frontier have not revealed any substantial and lasting deviations that would compel extensions of the Standard Model, despite many motivations for such new physics. Given this state of affairs, it is useful to summarize as accurately as possible our quantitative knowledge of the Standard Model in terms of the Lagrangian parameters that define the theory. These defining parameters can then be matched to a larger set of parameters in candidate new physics theories characterized by large mass scales. It is convenient to use the MS renormalization scheme [1,2] based on dimensional regularization [3\u20137] for this purpose. The Standard Model MS Lagrangian parameters to be evaluated include\nHiggs sector\u2236 \u03bb; m2;\ngauge couplings\u2236 g3; g; g0;\nquark Yukawa couplings\u2236 yt; yb; yc; ys; yu; yd;\nlepton Yukawa couplings\u2236 y\u03c4; y\u03bc; ye; \u00f01:1\u00de\nwhere we have neglected the neutrino sector. Also omitted here are the four physical parameters (three flavor-mixing angles and one CP-violating phase angle) associated with the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix for quarks, which can be considered separately and decouple from the discussion below to a high degree of accuracy due to unitarity of the CKM matrix. For a discussion and numerical values of these four CKM angle parameters in the Standard Model, see the relevant section of the Review of Particle Properties (RPP) [8] published by the Particle Data Group (PDG), and references therein. Each of the 14 quantities in Eq. (1.1) is a running\nparameter, dependent on the choice of MS renormalization scale Q, governed by renormalization group equations that are now known [9\u201335] with some effects through five-loop order. The normalization convention of the Higgs sector parameters is the now-standard one such that the treelevel potential for the canonically normalized real neutral component of the Higgs field is V \u00bc 1\n2 m2H2 \u00fe \u03bb 4 H4. In\nparticular, the Higgs squared mass parameter m2 is negative, as required by electroweak symmetry breaking, and can be traded for the vacuum expectation value v for H, defined as the minimum of the all-orders effective potential in Landau gauge, so that the sum of all tadpole diagrams (including the tree-level tadpole) simply vanishes. In practice, the effective potential is known fully at two-loop [36,37] and three-loop [38\u201340] orders, supplemented by the QCD four-loop contributions [33]. For the purposes of matching to ultraviolet new physics proposals, one should work in a nondecoupling scheme, in which all of the Standard Model particles including the top quark are propagating degrees of freedom. For this reason, we choose as a benchmark MS renormalization scale the value Q \u00bc 200 GeV, which is somewhat arbitrary but has Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

Furthermore, taking a fixed scale (rather than, say, the experimental top-quark mass, which is subject to uncertainty and change) provides for better numerical stability. The results given here can then be evolved to any desired matching scale by the Standard Model renormalization group equations.\nThe standard reference for important experimental results in high-energy physics, the RPP [8] published by the PDG, instead (so far, at least) summarizes our knowledge of the Standard Model in terms of what we will refer to as the on-shell quantities. The RPP quantities that are in the most direct correspondence to the Lagrangian parameters in Eq. (1.1) are\nfine-structure constant\u2236 \u03b1 \u00bc 1=137.035999084\u2026and\u0394\u03b1\u00f05\u00dehad\u00f0MZ\u00de; Fermi decay constant\u2236 GF;\n5-quark QCD coupling\u2236 \u03b1\u00f05\u00deS \u00f0MZ\u00de; heavy particle physical masses\u2236 Mt;Mh;MZ;MW;\nrunning light quark masses\u2236 mb\u00f0mb\u00de; mc\u00f0mc\u00de; ms\u00f02 GeV\u00de; mu\u00f02 GeV\u00de; md\u00f02 GeV\u00de; lepton pole masses\u2236 M\u03c4;M\u03bc;Me: \u00f01:2\u00de\nIt should be noted that in this paper MZ and MW are the on-shell masses in the PDG parametrization; these are related to the gauge-invariant complex pole squared masses sp \u00bc \u00f0Mp \u2212 i\u0393p=2\u00de2 by M \u00bc Mp\u00f01\u00fe \u03b4\u00de= ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 1 \u2212 \u03b4 p\n, where \u03b4 \u00bc \u03932p=4M2p in each case. (For recent discussions, see Refs. [41,42].) In principle, the hadronic contribution to the fine-structure constant, \u0394\u03b1\u00f05\u00dehad\u00f0MZ\u00de is not independent and could be determined in terms of the other quantities, but in practice it cannot be perturbatively evaluated and therefore is taken as an independent experimental input. The W-boson mass MW can also be determined in terms of the others. The other 14 on-shell quantities in Eq. (1.2) are dual to those of the 14 independent MS parameters in Eq. (1.1). This means that one can take the MS parameters as theoretical inputs with the on-shell quantities as outputs, or one can take the on-shell quantities as experimental inputs and view the MS parameters as the outputs. A great deal of effort has gone into relating the two sets of parameters and to evaluating MW in terms of the others. For a necessarily incomplete set of earlier\nreferences, see [43\u2013106], and papers discussed therein. The present work is based on the computer code SMDR [107,108], which implements calculations in Refs. [42,109\u2013113] in the tadpole-free pure MS scheme. This code contains command-line utilities and library programs for fitting the on-shell parameters in terms of the MS parameters, and vice versa, and for performing the renormalization group running in the Standard Model, implementing the state-of-the-art calculations. The purpose of the present paper is to provide simple and\nconvenient interpolation formulas that accurately provide the MS parameters in Eq. (1.1) and MW in terms of the onshell parameters in Eq. (1.2), obtained by doing a fit to the results2 of SMDR. The simplicity and accuracy of the interpolation formulas is aided by the fact that the allowed parameters in the Standard Model are now all experimentally restricted to rather narrow ranges. We now discuss the organization and notation of the\ninterpolation formulas below. First, define a set of benchmark (denoted by subscript 0) on-shell inputs, using the values from the most recent 2022 PDG data:\n1In the case of supersymmetry, current bounds on squarks and gluinos are now generally well above 1 TeV, but there is still some room for light weakly interacting superpartners. More generally, despite the LHC\u2019s negative search results, the new physics might be only very weakly coupled to the Standard Model.\n2More specifically, the interpolation formulas in the present paper have a similar functionality to the SMDR command-line invocation calc_fit -Q 200, but with a drastically shorter evaluation time.\n013010-2\n\u03b10 \u00bc 1=137.035999084; \u0394\u03b1\u00f05\u00dehad\u00f0MZ\u00de0 \u00bc 0.027660; GF0 \u00bc 1.1663787 \u00d7 10\u22125; \u03b1\u00f05\u00deS0 \u00f0MZ\u00de \u00bc 0.1179; Mt0 \u00bc 172.5 GeV; Mh0 \u00bc 125.25 GeV; MZ0 \u00bc 91.1876 GeV;\nmb\u00f0mb\u00de0 \u00bc 4.18 GeV; mc\u00f0mc\u00de0 \u00bc 1.27 GeV; ms\u00f02 GeV\u00de0 \u00bc 93 MeV; mu\u00f02 GeV\u00de0 \u00bc 2.16 MeV; md\u00f02 GeV\u00de0 \u00bc 4.67 MeV;\nM\u03c40 \u00bc 1.77686 GeV; M\u03bc0 \u00bc 0.1056583745 GeV; Me0 \u00bc 0.5109989461 MeV: \u00f01:3\u00de\nThe Sommerfeld fine-structure constant \u03b1 is very accurately known compared to the others, with a fractional uncertainty of 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221210, so no variation in it will be considered. For the other on-shell parameters, we next define the following dimensionless quantities:\n\u03b4Z \u00bc \u00f0MZ \u2212MZ0\u00de=\u00f00.001 GeV\u00de; \u00f01:4\u00de\n\u03b4t \u00bc \u00f0Mt \u2212Mt0\u00de=\u00f01 GeV\u00de; \u00f01:5\u00de\n\u03b4h \u00bc \u00f0Mh \u2212Mh0\u00de=\u00f00.1 GeV\u00de; \u00f01:6\u00de\n\u03b4S \u00bc 1000\u00bd\u03b1\u00f05\u00deS \u00f0MZ\u00de \u2212 \u03b1\u00f05\u00deS0 \u00f0MZ\u00de ; \u00f01:7\u00de\n\u03b4a \u00bc 104\u00bd\u0394\u03b1\u00f05\u00dehad\u00f0MZ\u00de \u2212 \u0394\u03b1\u00f05\u00dehad;0\u00f0MZ\u00de ; \u00f01:8\u00de\nas measures of the deviation from the benchmark model. The normalizations of these five quantities are chosen so that a change in the on-shell input by an amount of order the present experimental uncertainty will correspond very roughly to an order 1 change in the corresponding \u03b4. In the interpolation formulas found below, we will often give at least the contributions linear in the five \u03b4\u2019s above, even when they are numerically too small to be practically significant, in order to quantitatively illustrate their contributions to the parametric errors. In the interpolation formulas for the Yukawa couplings at Q \u00bc 200 GeV, we will also make use of the variations in the fermion masses as needed, parametrized by\n\u0394f \u00bc mf mf0 \u2212 1; \u00f01:9\u00de\nfor f \u00bc b; c; s; u; d; \u03c4; \u03bc; e, where the mf are running MS masses mb\u00f0mb\u00de, mc\u00f0mc\u00de, ms\u00f02 GeV\u00de, mu\u00f02 GeV\u00de, and md\u00f02 GeV\u00de for the light quarks and pole (on-shell) masses for the leptonsmf \u00bc M\u03c4,M\u03bc, andMe. Also, in a few of the interpolation formulas, we will include the small effect due to a possible deviation in the Fermi decay constant from its benchmark central value, parametrized by\n\u0394GF \u00bc GF GF0 \u2212 1: \u00f01:10\u00de\nThe effects of this are typically expected to be very small, since the fractional uncertainty in GF given in the RPP is about 5 \u00d7 10\u22127. The interpolation formulas presented below were obtained by running v1.2 of SMDR with its default choices repeatedly for points in parameter space on grids that cover the plausible allowed ranges and then performing a fit to obtain the coefficients, which were then validated on more parameter space grids. We aim to provide results accurate to well under the experimental and theoretical uncertainties, for deviations of the on-shell inputs by up to 5 times their RPP quoted experimental uncertainties. Contributions quadratic in the deviations therefore will also be included when necessary to achieve relative precision goals for each quantity as stated below. For each output parameter, we will quote a conservative fractional precision, which in this paper refers to the maximum fractional difference between the interpolation formula result and the output of SMDR with default scale-setting choices. The maximum refers to the differences obtained in a scan as all on-shell inputs are varied over ranges such that the total deviation from the experimental central values, added in quadrature, is \u2264 5\u03c3. Here we interpret the uncertainties quoted in the RPP as 1\u03c3, even though a Gaussian distribution of errors may not be the appropriate description. It should be recognized that the actual theoretical uncertainty and the parametric uncertainty are both always much larger than this fractional precision. We have attempted to err on the side of including coefficients even when they are only significant for rather large deviations from the experimental central values. We now provide the benchmark output results obtained using v1.2 of SMDR with default choices. We give many more significant digits than justified by the theoretical and parametric uncertainties, merely for the sake of reproducibility.

The values in Eqs. (1.11) will be used in the interpolation formulas below, as they give the results when all of the \u03b4\u2019s vanish, by definition.\nII.

(1.25), and the other potentially significant coefficients are\nctMW \u00bc 7.61 \u00d7 10\u22125; cZMW \u00bc 1.56 \u00d7 10\u22125; caMW \u00bc \u22122.29 \u00d7 10\u22125; cSMW \u00bc \u22128.8 \u00d7 10\u22126; chMW \u00bc \u22125.9 \u00d7 10\u22127; cttMW \u00bc 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22127: \u00f02:2\u00de\nThis interpolation formula reproduces the results of SMDR (with its default scale-setting choices) to better than 0.1 MeV, which is much smaller than the current theoretical and experimental uncertainties, when the input on-shell parameters are varied such that the total deviation from the central values, added in quadrature, is \u2264 5\u03c3. The results above are based on the pure MS scheme used by SMDR and can be compared with similar interpolation formula results based on on-shell [80] and hybrid [98] scheme calculations, which both used fits to a much wider range for the Higgs mass. A numerical comparison between the results from these three different approaches wasmade in Ref. [42] (see in particular Figs. 4.1 and 4.2), showing that they agree well within the theoretical uncertainty due to renormalization scale dependence and supporting a\ntheoretical error estimate of perhaps 4 MeV. This is less than the parametric error, coming principally from the top-quark mass, of about 6.11\u03b4t \u00fe 1.25\u03b4Z \u2212 1.84\u03b4a\u2212 0.71\u03b4S \u2212 0.047\u03b4h \u00fe 0.010\u03b42t , in MeV, which can be read off from Eq. (2.2). The relatively large uncertainty associated with the top-quarkmass is difficult to reduce, since it is due in large part to the problems in connecting hadron collider measurements and simulations to a well-defined shortdistance top-quark mass or Yukawa coupling.\nIII.

Again, the theoretical and parametric errors are much larger than this fractional precision, with the top-quark mass giving the largest contribution to the error budget other than the Higgs boson mass itself.

Yukawa couplings of light quarks\nIn the interpolation formulas for light-quark Yukawa couplings in the present subsection, the quantities \u03b4a, \u03b4h, and \u03b4Z make a relatively insignificant difference and are therefore omitted. For the bottom-quark Yukawa coupling at Q \u00bc 200 GeV, we find\nyb \u00bc yb0\u00f01\u00fe cbyb\u0394b \u00fe cbbyb \u03942b \u00fe cbSyb \u0394b\u03b4S \u00fe cSyb\u03b4S \u00fe ctyb\u03b4t \u00fe cSSyb \u03b42S \u00fe cSSSyb \u03b43S\u00de; \u00f03:13\u00de\nwhere yb0 was given in Eq.

For the Yukawa couplings at Q \u00bc 200 GeV, we find\nyq \u00bc yq0\u00f01\u00fe \u0394q\u00de\u00f01\u00fe cSyq\u03b4S \u00fe cSSyq \u03b42S \u00fe cSSSyq \u03b43S \u00fe cbyq\u0394b \u00fe ctyq\u03b4t\u00de; \u00f03:17\u00de\nwhere the coefficients in all three cases (q \u00bc s, d, u) are approximated well by\ncSyq \u00bc \u22120.01089; cSSyq \u00bc \u22127.93 \u00d7 10\u22125; cSSSyq \u00bc \u22121.2 \u00d7 10\u22126; cbyq \u00bc \u22120.0128; ctyq \u00bc \u22121.5 \u00d7 10\u22125; \u00f03:18\u00de\nand ys0, yd0, and yu0 were given, respectively, in Eqs. (1.19)\u2013(1.21). These formulas agree with those obtained by SMDR to a fractional precision of better than 10\u22124.\nE. Yukawa couplings of leptons\nFor the tau-lepton Yukawa coupling at Q \u00bc 200 GeV, we obtain\ny\u03c4 \u00bc y\u03c40\u00f01\u00fe \u0394\u03c4 \u00fe 0.5\u0394GF \u00fe cty\u03c4 \u03b4t \u00fe cSy\u03c4 \u03b4S \u00fe cay\u03c4 \u03b4a \u00fe chy\u03c4 \u03b4h \u00fe cZy\u03c4 \u03b4Z \u00fe ctty\u03c4 \u03b42t \u00fe ctSy\u03c4 \u03b4t\u03b4S\u00de; \u00f03:19\u00de\nwhere y\u03c40 was given in Eq.

The Yukawa couplings for l \u00bc \u03bc, e at Q \u00bc 200 GeV are written in the common form:\nyl \u00bc yl0\u00f01\u00fe \u0394l \u00fe 0.5\u0394GF \u00fe ctyl\u03b4t \u00fe cSyl\u03b4S \u00fe cayl\u03b4a \u00fe chyl\u03b4h \u00fe cZyl\u03b4Z \u00fe cttyl\u03b42t \u00fe ctSyl\u03b4t\u03b4S \u00fe ccyl\u0394c \u00fe cbyl\u0394b\u00de; \u00f03:21\u00de\nwhere y\u03bc0 and ye0 were given in Eqs.

Since the present fractional uncertainties in M\u03bc andMe are about 2 \u00d7 10\u22128 and 6 \u00d7 10\u22129, respectively, we see that for each lepton, the bottleneck for obtaining the most accurate possible Yukawa coupling in the ultraviolet is not the uncertainty in the corresponding lepton mass, but rather the uncertainty associated with the top-quark mass, which is difficult to reduce as we have already mentioned.\n013010-7\nIV. OUTLOOK\nIn this paper we have presented simple interpolation formulas that provide the fundamental Lagrangian parameters for the Standard Model, given the corresponding onshell experimental values as inputs. (The three physical angles and CP-violating phase associated with CKM mixing are omitted, having a tiny effect on these results due to CKM unitarity, and can be obtained from Ref. [8] and sources referenced therein.) These results are an alternative to a more time-consuming and complicated evaluation using e.g., the computer code SMDR, on which our results are based. The structure of the interpolation formulas has been designed so as to avoid any numerically significant loss of precision and are made to provide results at the MS renormalization scale Q \u00bc 200 GeV as a reference. For convenience, we have included as Supplemental Material [115] a simple interactive command-line PYTHON code sm200.py implementing the\ninterpolation formulas above. We intend to update our results in the preprint version of this paper and in that code as new theoretical refinements and experimental measurements become available. Besides satisfying basic curiosity about the fundamental parameters of the Standard Model, the results given here will have applications in matching to various candidate ultraviolet completions of the Standard Model, provided that the mass scales associated with new physics are sufficiently high that nonrenormalizable terms in the effective theory can be neglected or corrected for. The results also can be viewed as providing the parametric error budget for the defining couplings of the Standard Model Lagrangian.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation Grant No. 2013340.\n[1] W.
