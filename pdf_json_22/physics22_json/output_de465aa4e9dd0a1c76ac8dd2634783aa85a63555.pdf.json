This dynamical system in particular and Duffing-type equations in general, which can be used to describe pendulums, vibration absorbers, beams, cables, micromechanical structures, and electrical circuits, have a long history [2]. The equation of motion (1) can describe several non-linear phenomena, such as various non-linear resonances, symmetry breaking, chaotic dynamics, period-doubling route to chaos, multistability and fractal dependence on initial conditions, and jumps [2\u20136].\nThe aim of our work is to research the jump phenomenon described and investigated for the system (1) in an interesting study by Kovacic and Brennan [1], using the implicit function machinery. An early approach to the jump phenomenon is due to Holmes and Rand [7] in the Catastrophe Theory setting where a discriminant of a cubic equation, arising in the amplitude-frequency response function, was analysed to detect multivaluedness of the amplitude. Recently, Kalma\u0301r-Nagy and Balachandran applied a differential condition to detect vertical tangencies, characteristic for the jump phenomenon [8].\nar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n05 01\n7v 1\n[ m\nat h.\nD S]\nIn the next Section we describe the steady state solution (2) [1,6,9] which is an implicit function of A0 and \u2126 (5) and compute an implicit function of A1 and \u2126 (6a), (6b). Working in the framework developed in our earlier papers [10,11] we compute the jump manifold in Section 4 containing information about all possible jumps which is the main achievement of this work. We summarize our results in the last Section."

We shall thus refer to equation (12a), which defines an implicit function of variables A0, \u03b3, \u03b6, F , F0, as jump manifold equation. Thus, the jump manifold J (A0, \u03b3, \u03b6, F, F0):\nJ (A0, \u03b3, \u03b6, F, F0) = {(A0, \u03b3, \u03b6, F, F0) : J (A0; \u03b3, \u03b6, F, F0) = 0} , (13)\nbelongs to 5D space.

(14) In other words, for any set of parameters \u03b3, \u03b6, F, F0 belonging to J\u22a5 there is a jump in dynamical system (1) and all jumps occur for parameters belonging to J\u22a5.\nWe shall consider 2D and 3D projections, plotting J (A0; \u03b3\u2217, \u03b6\u2217, F\u2217, F0) and J (A0; \u03b3\u2217, \u03b6\u2217, F, F0), respectively, where parameters \u03b3\u2217, \u03b6\u2217, F\u2217 or \u03b3\u2217, \u03b6\u2217 are fixed.\n4.1.1 2D projection, J (A0; \u03b3\u2217, \u03b6\u2217, F\u2217, F0) = 0\nGlobal picture of the jump manifold J (A0; \u03b3\u2217, \u03b6\u2217, F\u2217, F0) where \u03b3\u2217 = 0.0783, \u03b6\u2217 = 0.025, F\u2217 = 0.1 and A0, F0 are variable is shown in Fig. 1.\nFirstly, all points lying on the blue curve correspond to jumps. Moreover, there are four critical points, dividing Fig. 1 into parts and referred to as border points: F (1) 0 = 0, F (2) 0 = 0.0920, F (3) 0 = 0.7385, F (4) 0 = 6. 5321, defined and\ncomputed in the Subsection 4.2. It turns out that F0 \u2208 ( F (1) 0 , F (2) 0 ) there\nare two vertical tangencies, for F0 \u2208 ( F (2) 0 , F (3) 0 ) there are four, for F0 \u2208(\nF (3) 0 , F (4) 0 ) there are two and there are no vertical tangencies for F0 > F (4) 0 .\nFor example, in Fig. 2 the case F0 = 0.4 is shown. More exactly, the implicit function A1 (\u2126), computed with help of Eq. (6b) is plotted for \u03b3 = 0.0783, \u03b6 = 0.025, F = 0.1 and F0 = 0.4. Red dots, denoting vertical tangencies, correspond to red dots in Fig. 1. These points can be easily computed from Eqs. (11), (4).\nIndeed, solving equations (11) for \u03b3 = 0.0783, \u03b6 = 0.025, F = 0.1, F0 = 0.4 we get four real solutions \u2126, A0 shown in the first two column in Table 3. Then for the above values of \u2126 we solve equations (4) obtaining four values of A1 listed in the third column of the Table 3.\nIn Fig. 3 the bifurcation diagram is shown for the set of parameters listed\nin Fig. 2. Note good agreement of end points of bifurcation branches in Fig. 3 with \u2126 coordinates of red dots in Fig. 2.\n4.1.2 3D projection, J (A0; \u03b3\u2217, \u03b6\u2217, F, F0) = 0\nWe now fix two parameters only, for example \u03b3\u2217 = 0.0783, \u03b4\u2217 = 0.025, and plot the jump manifold J (A0; \u03b3\u2217, \u03b6\u2217, F, F0) as a 3D surface, see Fig. 4.\nNext we compute one border point. For example, we choose F0 = 0.5 (\u03b3\u2217 = 0.0783, \u03b4\u2217 = 0.025) and compute the corresponding border point as F = 0.544 860, A0 = 1. 238 340 as explained in the next Subsection.\nThe blue vertical line, given by the just computed data (0.544 860, 0.5, A0) with A0 variable, touches the upper lobe of the jump manifold exactly at the border point (0.544 860, 0.5, 1. 238 340)."

            "text": "There are also other qualitative changes of the amplitudes A1 (\u2126) controlled by the parameters. For example, number of solutions of Eq. (5) for a given value of \u2126 may change. This happens when two vector tangencies appear at the same value of \u2126. For example, let \u03b3 = 0.0783, \u03b6 = 0.025, F = 0.1. To find a value of F0 for which this happens we have to find a double root of \u2126 of equations (11). Therefore, solving Eqs. (11) numerically for several values of F0 we easily find that for F0 = 0.301 007 there is indeed a double root: \u2126 = 0.597 114, A0 = 0.679 284 and \u2126 = 0.597 114, A0 = 1. 411 787. There is another such case, for F0 = 0.429 166 there is a double root: \u2126 = 0.714 419, A0 = 0.459 118 and \u2126 = 0.714 419, A0 = 1. 628 271.\nTherefore, for F0 \u2208 (0.301, 0.429) equation (5) has five solutions."

Our formalism, described in Section 4 \u2013 built on an idea to use\na differential condition to detect vertical tangencies, due to Kalma\u0301r-Nagy and Balachandran [8] \u2013 can be applied to arbitrary steady-state solution.\nOur work on the asymmetric Duffing oscillator is a supplementation and amplification of results obtained by Kovacic and Brennan [1]. More precisely, the sequence of figures 8.4 (a) \u2013(e), computed in [1] for \u03b3 = 0.0783, \u03b6 = 0.025, F = 0.1 and F0 = 0.01, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.95, respectively, can be appended with Figs. 5 and 6, computed for F0 = 0.092, 0.7385, 6.532 and F0 = 0.301, 0.429. Therefore, the whole sequence of metamorphoses of the curve A1 (\u2126) consists of plots computed for F0 = 0.01, 0.092, 0.2, 0.301, 0.4, 0.429, 0.5, 0.7385, 0.95, 6.532 where numbers highlighted in bold correspond to Figs. 8.4 (a) \u2013 (e) plotted in [1]."
