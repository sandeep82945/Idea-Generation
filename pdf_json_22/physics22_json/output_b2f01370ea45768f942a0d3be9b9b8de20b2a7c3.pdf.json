Finally, we show the relationship between the control parameter in the model and the experiments using a simple parameter estimation technique.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nLean combustion systems are prone to thermoacoustic instability wherein high-amplitude acoustic pressure oscillations occur due to positive feedback between the unsteady turbulent flame and the acoustic modes of the combustion chamber.1,2 These oscillations can result in disastrous consequences, such as severe damage to the engine components and even mission failures.3 As a result, it is vital to develop methods to suppress thermoacoustic instability. The present paper discusses a novel strategy of controlling limit cycle oscillations by actuating the swirler used for flame stabilization. To explain the method of suppressing limit cycle oscillations, we provide a synchronization model.\nSelf-excited nonlinear thermoacoustic oscillations arise when the heat release rate oscillations are in phase with the acoustic pressure oscillations,4 and the amount of energy added to the acoustic field due to the nonlinear feedback from the flame exceeds the acoustic damping in the combustor.5 There are a number of physical mechanisms, which generate heat release rate fluctuations; these include equivalence ratio fluctuations,6,7 swirl number fluctuations,8 flame-vortex interactions,9,10 and entropy fluctuations.11,12 Heat release rate fluctuations generated through these mechanisms undergo feedback coupling and mutual synchronization with acoustic pressure fluctuations in the confinement, resulting in the occurrence of thermoacoustic instability.13\nTo comprehend the physical mechanism for the onset of thermoacoustic instability, it is important to investigate the spatiotemporal behavior of the thermoacoustic systems. The onset of periodic oscillations (thermoacoustic instability) occurs via a transition from the stable operation of the combustor (otherwise known as combustion noise) through intermittency. Intermittency is the dynamical state where bursts of periodic oscillations appear amidst epochs of aperiodic oscillations at apparently random intervals.14 Recently, several studies have performed the spatiotemporal analysis of the synchronization between the local heat release rate fluctuations from the flame and the acoustic pressure oscillations.15\u201318 They reported that when the control parameter is changed, the coupling between the acoustic field and the local heat release rate increases, which leads to the emergence of order from disorder during the transition to thermoacoustic instability. Consequently, mitigation strategies aim at interrupting the coupling between the acoustic pressure field and the unsteady heat release rate fluctuations.\nThese control strategies are broadly classified as passive control19,20 and active control.21,22 In passive control, some aspects of the combustor, such as the acoustic characteristics or the heat release rate dynamics, is changed independently of the combustor operation.20 The change in acoustic characteristics can be achieved by the use of acoustic damping resonators23 and the change in heat release dynamics by fuel injection strategy24 or fuel staging.25\nHowever, passive control strategies are effective only over a limited range of frequencies, require expensive and time-consuming design adjustments, and may be detrimental to engine performance. An alternate technique is active control, which can be implemented in two different ways:26 closed-loop and open-loop control. During closed-loop active control, the state of the combustor is continuously monitored and control measures are adopted based on the specific state of the system.22 In contrast, open-loop active control is achieved by forcing the system using actuators, without any feedback from controllers or sensors monitoring the dynamics in the combustor.27 Active control is typically achieved through external acoustic forcing28,29 or fuel-air modulation30,31 where the suppression depends on the forced synchronization of the thermoacoustic system.29,32,33 However, the implementation of these techniques remains quite challenging. Specifically, acoustic forcing mechanisms do not scale up with the amplitude levels of realistic turbulent combustors, and modulating fuel-air values are unreliable over the extremely long lifespan of turbulent combustors.32,34\nGiven these challenges, Gopakumar et al.35 proposed a novel strategy involving the use of an actuated swirler for altering the coupling between the flame and the acoustic fluctuations. They found that actuating the static swirler, used for flame stabilization inside the combustion chamber, even at moderate rotation rates significantly altered the flow field and the flame structure.36 This alternation in the flow field caused by actuating swirler was associated with the suppression of thermoacoustic instability, where low-amplitude aperiodic oscillations are observed through an intermittency route, hinting toward the de-synchronization of the acoustic pressure and the heat release rate fluctuations during the state of suppression. The underlying mechanism of suppression was then modeled by Dutta et al.37 based on the synchronization of flame oscillators through the Kuramoto model,38 which was able to quantitatively capture the heat release rate response observed in the experiments.\nDespite the usefulness of the heat release rate model, the underlying mechanism by which the acoustic pressure is coupled was not included in the model. Therefore, in this study, we couple the acoustic elements with the heat release rate model to capture the dynamics observed during suppression experiments. We extend the model introduced by Dutta et al.37 and build upon our recent work on the mean-field model of thermoacoustic transitions39 to explain the method of suppression observed in the swirl-controlled experiments. The effect of the actuated swirler is included by accounting for the time scale of the swirler rotation. This mismatch between the convective time scale and the acoustic time scale is then shown to be responsible for weakening the feedback coupling between the heat release rate and acoustic pressure oscillations, leading to the desynchronization between pressure and heat release rate fluctuations during the suppression of thermoacoustic instability. In this manner, we develop a thermoacoustic mean-field model for studying the transition to the state of suppression.\nOur model demonstrates the transition from thermoacoustic instability to the state of suppression by taking the amplitude spectrum of the heat release rate fluctuations as the only input from the experiments. After qualitatively confirming that a transition to the state of suppression produced from the model corresponds with the experiments, we use an optimization technique to determine the relationship between the control parameter in the model\nChaos 33, 043104 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0136385 33, 043104-2\nPublished under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing\nD ow nloaded from http://pubs.aip.org/aip/cha/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/5.0136385/16825559/043104_1_5.0136385.pdf\nand the experiments. We then investigate the dynamics of the flame by computing the time average over pressure maxima and minima during the state of thermoacoustic instability, intermittency, and suppression. Finally, we demonstrate that our model without any spatial inputs qualitatively captures features of spatiotemporal synchronization obtained from the experiments.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. We introduce the experimental setup and measurements in Sec. II. Further, in Sec. III, we derive a thermoacoustic mean-field model followed by estimating model parameters from the experiments. This is followed by results and discussion in Sec. IV. Finally, in Sec. VI we summarize the major findings."

The combustor was characterized in our previous work35\u201337 in a vertical configuration and is used in the present experiments in a horizontal configuration to facilitate length variation and imaging. We have achieved mitigation of thermoacoustic instability up to \u223c20 dB for the horizontal setup under similar operating conditions as the vertical one, reported in the earlier works.36,37 This establishes that the overall functioning and observations from the experimental setup remain unaffected by the change in orientation. A lean mixture (\u03c6 = 0.68) consisting of 6.5 SLPM (standard liter per minute) of methane and 90 SLPM of air (Reynolds number, Re = 6 \u00d7 103 based on swirler diameter, with an uncertainty of \u00b10.8%) is supplied into the settling chamber through four equally spaced inlet ports. The equivalence ratio is calculated as \u03c6 = (m\u0307f/m\u0307a)actual/(m\u0307f/m\u0307a)stoichiometry, where m\u0307f and m\u0307a are the mass flow rate of the fuel and air, respectively. The reactant mixture flows into the combustion chamber made of quartz, having a diameter of 46 mm and a length of 60 mm, where it is ignited. An aluminum duct of 1.5 m in length is mounted over the quartz duct, which acts as a resonator to generate self-excited thermoacoustic instability in the combustor. The flame stabilization is achieved using the swirler having a diameter of 30 mm and consisting of eight straight vanes inclined at \u03b4 = 30\u25e6 with the axis mounted on the central shaft of the motor. The geometric swirl number is obtained as S = 2/3 tan \u03b4 = 0.385.40 The swirler is actuated through a stepper motor to a maximum speed of 2100 rpm for the suppression experiments.\nThe airflow rate (m\u0307a) and the fuel flow rate (m\u0307f) are controlled using digital mass flow controllers (Alicat Scientific, MCR series) with a measurement uncertainty of \u00b1(0.8% of reading + 0.2% of full-scale). Acoustic signatures from the combustor are acquired using a Kistler pressure transducer (sensitivity 1.84 V/bar, uncertainty \u00b10.2%) mounted 20 mm upstream of the dump plane. The pressure signals are acquired for a duration of 5 s at a sampling frequency of 10 kHz and digitized using a National Instruments 16-bit PCI 6251 card. A high-speed CMOS camera (Photon SA5) fitted with LaVision IRO (Intensified Relay Optics) and Tamaron 150\u2013600 mm f/5\u20136.3 telephoto lens is used to capture the unfiltered chemiluminescence images of the flame. The camera recorded 60 \u00d7 60 mm2 of the combustion chamber onto 480 \u00d7 480 pixels2 of the sensor at a framing rate of 2 kHz while focused at the r \u22122 plane at 5 mm height from the swirler exit. We recorded 104 number of\nimages at each state of the combustor operation. We simultaneously perform acoustic pressure and imaging measurements for making quantitative assessments.\nFigure 1(b) illustrates the variation of acoustic pressure amplitude of the first dominant mode as a function of the swirler rotation rate obtained experimentally. The error bars in the plot show the variation between the amplitudes across three experimental runs. Figure 1(c) shows the change in the dominant frequency of the acoustic pressure during a transition from thermoacoustic instability to the state of suppression. The combustor remains at thermoacoustic instability for 0 rpm with a first mode amplitude of 153 dB and frequency of 76.9 Hz. At 1800 rpm, the amplitude reduces to about 130 dB and frequency of 94.2 Hz as intermittent oscillations emerge in the combustor. Finally, the system transitions to the state of suppression at 2100 rpm, where broadband sound replaces the dominant acoustic mode. Consequently, we observe a suppression of approximately 30 dB on varying the swirler rotation rate from 0 to 2100 rpm."

            "text": "The nonlinearity in the thermoacoustic system arises from a combination of the flame response to the background turbulent flow, hydrodynamic instabilities, and acoustic fluctuations.44 These contributions manifest in the overall heat release rate fluctuations. We assume that the contributions from the nonlinear response of the flame is encapsulated in an ensemble of non-identical phase oscillators evolving collectively under the influence of the acoustic pressure oscillations. We formulate the phase oscillators as nonidentical oscillators by assigning the frequencies to each oscillator from the frequency distribution. The frequency distribution is obtained from the experimentally measured heat release rate spectrum during the state of suppression. The interaction among the phase oscillators happens through the phase (8) and normalized amplitude (A\u0302) of the acoustic pressure fluctuations.\nIn particular, the interaction function taking into account the impact of the phase of the acoustics (8) on the phase of each oscillator (\u03b8i) is introduced as a simple periodic function: sin(8\u2212 \u03b8i). Moreover, the effective strength of the coupling due to the oscillatoracoustic coupling (K\u0303) and the amplitude (A\u0302) of acoustic pressure fluctuations is expressed as K\u0303A\u0302. This proportionality of the effective coupling strength on A\u0302 sets up a positive feedback loop between the coupling of the phase oscillators and the amplitude of acoustic perturbation. As the population becomes more coherent, A\u0302 grows and so the effective coupling K\u0303A\u0302 increases, which tends to include even more oscillators into the synchronized group. In this manner, the thermoacoustic feedback is incorporated in the model.\nIn this paper, we consider the simplest case of the evolution of coupled phase oscillators, which is expressed as38,45\n\u03b8\u0307i(t\u0303) = \u03c9\u0303i + K\u0303A\u0302(t\u0303) sin [ 8(t\u0303)\u2212 \u03b8i(t\u0303) ] , (3)\nwhere \u03b8i is the instantaneous phase of the ith oscillator with i = 1, . . . , N. The frequency distribution (\u03c9\u0303i) of the oscillators is centered around the acoustic frequency (\u03030). In the above equation, the phase of individual oscillators corresponding to the phase of local heat release rate oscillations is directly coupled to the acoustic pressure, whereas the phase oscillators are equally weighted and indirectly coupled to each other via the acoustic variable. The exact form considered in Eq. (3) is inspired from the theory of interacting phase oscillators encountered in complex systems theory38,39,45 and is a natural choice, as we intend to study the underlying synchronization behavior of the thermoacoustic system.\nWe express the overall heat release rate fluctuations (q\u0307\u2032) as a summation of the contribution from all the instantaneous phase oscillators,\n\u02d9\u0303q\u2032 = q\u03030\nN \u2211\ni=1\nsin [ \u03030 t\u0303 + \u03b8i(t\u0303) ] , (4)\nwhere the term q\u03030 is the amplitude of heat release rate fluctuations of an individual oscillator."

Figures 4(b) and 5(b) correspond to r = 0.39 and depict intermittent oscillations in both p\u2032 and q\u0307\u2032. These intermittent oscillations lead to a change from a bimodal to a unimodal distribution in the probability density function of p\u2032 and q\u0307\u2032. We note that the model accurately depicts the location of epochs of periodic and aperiodic oscillations in both the time series (p\u2032 and q\u0307\u2032) while also depicting almost identical probability distribution function of both the time series.

The amplitude spectrum of p\u2032 is broadband with a peak at 91 Hz. Again, the match between the experiments and the model is quite evident.\nQuite notably, the model yields a good match in the characteristics of the time series of the pressure and heat release rate fluctuations during various dynamical states and only requires the heat release rate spectrum during the state of suppression as an input from the experiments for obtaining g(\u03c9). Additionally, the amplitude spectrums and probability density functions of p\u2032 and q\u0307\u2032 for the various states of combustor operation are well approximated.

The correspondence between the control parameters in the model and experiments will allow us to explain the experimental observations in terms of the physics embodied in the model. The estimated values strongly imply a linear relationship between the control parameter in our experiments ( r) and the model (K). The coupling strength linearly decreases according to the relation, K = 4.1(0.71 \u2212 r), thus providing a posteriori justification for assuming a linear relationship between K and r in Eq. (5). The linear relation between r and K implies that when r = 0, then coupling strength among the phase oscillators is maximum, encouraging phase synchronization and leading to limit cycle oscillations. Increasing the value of r leads to a decrease in the coupling strength (K) among the phase oscillators, promoting phase de-synchronization, and, hence, the state of suppression.

Thus, the flame fluctuations are strongly correlated with the pressure fluctuations. Moreover, the flame structure shows flame stabilization along the central shear layer separating the inner and outer recirculation zones.36\nNext, we consider the flame dynamics during the periodic part of intermittency [Figs. 7(c) and 7(d)]. The phase-averaged flame image during maxima and minima still depict high and lowintensity values, respectively, albeit with lower intensity as compared to thermoacoustic instability. While the flame structure is similar to that during thermoacoustic instability, the distribution is diffused during both maxima and minima. This implies that some parts of the flame may not be attaining maxima and minima at the instant of pressure maxima and pressure minima. Thus, the flame fluctuations are weakly correlated with the pressure fluctuations. Finally, Figs. 7(e) and 7(f) correspond to the state of suppression. The phase-averaged chemiluminescence images corresponding to the pressure peaks [Fig. 7(e)] and troughs [Fig. 7(f)] are similar to each\nother. We observe incoherent and non-uniform flame structures with low intensity in comparison to the periodic part of intermittency and thermoacoustic instability. Moreover, the distributions of intensity between pressure maxima and minima are virtually indistinguishable, implying no correlation between flame fluctuations and acoustic fluctuations.\nWe are aware that any fluctuation in the flame results in an unsteady heat release rate which, in turn, causes acoustic disturbances in the combustion chamber and affects the flame when reflected from an appropriate acoustic boundary. The strength of the periodic fluctuations in pressure and heat release rate starts increasing as the feedback between the acoustic field and heat release rate fluctuations increases. In Fig. 7, we notice the difference in the flame intensities when the swirler rotation rate is systematically varied. As a result, by varying the swirler rotation rate, we are disrupting the strength of a feedback loop to bring the sustained high-intensity oscillations in the flame at thermoacoustic instability to the low-intensity flame fluctuations at the state of suppression."

The local heat release rate fluctuations are extracted from the intensity variation observed at each pixel of the time-resolved chemiluminescence images. The flame images are coarse-grained over 6 \u00d7 6 pixels to minimize the effect of noisy fluctuations in them. We install the pressure transducer near to the location of the flame imaging, to avoid acoustic phase delay effects in our experimental measurements.

The instantaneous phasor field (\u03c8i) is obtained by subtracting the phase of the acoustic pressure (8) from the phase of the local heat release rate fluctuations (\u03b8i). The instantaneous phase of the local heat release rate fluctuations is obtained using the Hilbert transformation.\nIn Fig. 8(a) (Multimedia view), when the swirler is static ( r = 0), the acoustic pressure and heat release rate oscillate in phase, leading to a coherent field of the phasors.

In this state, the heat release rate fluctuations are dominated only by the turbulent flow, which results in a desynchronized field of the phasors and a broadband distribution of P(\u03c8i). This asynchronous behavior of the local heat release rate fluctuations during the state of suppression prevents the pressure oscillations from increasing in the amplitude, which leads to lowamplitude aperiodic fluctuations in the temporal dynamics of both acoustic pressure (p\u2032) and global heat release rate fluctuations (q\u0307\u2032).\nWe now quantify the characteristics of synchronization through a measure called the Kuramoto order parameter.58 The time-averaged order parameter (r\u0304) is defined as\nr\u0304 = 1\nN\n\u2329 \u2223\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\nN \u2211\ni=1\nexp (i\u03b8i(t))\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u232a\nt\n, (13)\nwhere \u03b8i is the phase of the ith phase oscillator and \u3008\u00b7\u3009t implies time average. The order parameter is defined as the degree of synchrony among the oscillators and it varies between [0, 1]. A value of r\u0304 close to zero indicates de-synchronized states, whereas a value of r\u0304 close to one indicates synchronized states.\nFigure 9(a) depicts the variation of the order parameter as a function of the non-dimensional swirler rotation rate ( r). The time-averaged order parameter (r\u0304) from the model is determined using Eq. (13), while r\u0304 from the experiments is determined according to Eq. (D1) (see Appendix D). The gradual decrease in the order parameter (r\u0304) indicates a transition from an ordered state where the heat release rate oscillators are in synchrony to a disordered state\nwhere the oscillators are in asynchrony. Note that the minor deviation in the order parameter (r\u0304) from the model and experiment is due to the effect of background turbulent flow on the flame during the transition to the suppression state. For instance, Figs. 4 and 5 show the heat release rate spectrums are noisier than the acoustic pressure spectrums, indicating the phase jitter59,60 due to the turbulence is always stronger in the heat release rate signal than in the acoustic pressure signal. Furthermore, in Fig. 8(a), during the state of thermoacoustic instability, the majority of the phasors are aligned in one direction except for a few randomly distributed pockets in the center. A mean-field model of synchronization, on the other hand, does not account for the turbulence, resulting in the minor disagreement in the value of r\u0304. These effects can potentially be incorporated through stochastic modeling, which will be taken up in the future.\nTo compare the synchronization observed in the spatial field of the experiments (Fig. 8) and from the model [Eq. (7)], we plot the characteristics of the oscillators in the \u03b8\u0307i \u2212 \u03c8i phase space. Here, \u03b8\u0307i is the instantaneous frequency and \u03c8i is the phase difference between \u03b8i and 8.

The typical instantaneous oscillator distribution in the \u03b8\u0307i \u2212 \u03c8i plane, as well as the distribution of P(\u03b8\u0307i) and P(\u03c8i) during the state of (b) thermoacoustic instability, (c)\nintermittency, and (d) suppression for experimental (lighter marker) and modeling (darker marker) dataset. The Kuramoto order parameter (r) from the experiments and model (\u2013) is shown in the last column. Multimedia views: https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0136385.2; https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0136385.3; https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0136385.4\nSince the heat release rate fluctuations from the experiments are spatially distributed, comparing the characteristics of oscillators in the \u03b8\u0307i \u2212 \u03c8i plane allows us to evaluate how well the low-dimensional mean-field synchronization model captures the characteristics of the spatiotemporal synchronization.\nIn Fig. 9(b) (Multimedia view), when the swirler is static ( r = 0) corresponding to thermoacoustic instability [see Fig. 4(a)], we observe that the oscillators are entrained at the acoustic frequency and are phase-locked with the distribution of \u03c8i mostly between \u2212\u03c0/2 and \u03c0/2 radians (first column). In the last two columns, we notice a sharp peak, narrowband distribution of frequency P(\u03b8\u0307i) and relative phase P(\u03c8i). The value of order parameter r\u0304 is 0.8, implying global phase synchronization among the phase oscillators. In Fig. 9(c) (Multimedia view), when the swirler rotation rate is r = 0.39 corresponding to the state of intermittency [see Fig. 4(b)], we notice the larger regions of phase-synchronized clusters where \u03c8i < |\u03c0/2| at some spatial locations and \u03c8i > |\u03c0/2| at other locations and comparatively less narrowband distribution of P(\u03b8\u0307i) and P(\u03c8i). The order parameter is r\u0304 = 0.13 during the state\nof intermittency. Finally, in Fig. 9(d) (Multimedia view), when the swirler rotation rate is r = 0.455 corresponding to the state of suppression [see Fig. 4(c)], the oscillators are distributed in \u03c8i > |\u03c0/2|, implying the phase de-synchronized among the oscillators. We also observe a broadband distribution in the distribution of P(\u03b8\u0307i) and P(\u03c8i) and a value of r\u0304 close to zero. Thus, the gradual disappearance of the order among the oscillators, which is associated with the continuous shrinking of the size of the cluster of oscillators, leads to a continuous de-synchronized transition."

After obtaining the probability distribution of each permutation pattern p(\u03c0i) where i = 1, 2, . . . , D!, we estimate the permutation entropy Hp normalized by the maximum permutation entropy log2 D! as\nHp = \u2212\n\u2211D! i=1 p(\u03c0i) log2 p(\u03c0i)\nlog2 D! , (14)\nwhere the lower bound of Hp = 0 corresponds to a deterministic process, while the upper bound Hp = 1 corresponds to an entirely random process.\nFigure 10(a) shows the variation of permutation entropy (Hp) as a function of the swirler rotation rate ( r) obtained from the model (\u2013) and experiments ( ). We under-sampled the data to 2 kHz and took into account the embedding dimension D = 3 with its elements separated by a delay \u03c4 = 1 s. The under-sampling is used to reduce the computational cost involved in obtaining Hp. During the state of thermoacoustic instability, we obtain the value of Hp from the experiments and model around 0.3. The value of Hp begins to rise during the intermittency state and reaches 0.65 during the suppression state. We can see that Hp from the model closely approximates Hp from the experiments.\nThe recurrence rate (RR) is another nonlinear measure calculated following Nair et al.14 from the acoustic pressure time series. The recurrence rate (RR) is one of the statistical measures constructed through a recurrence quantification analysis and is a useful quantifier for measuring randomness in the signal. Recurrences in the phase space can be expressed as a matrix Rij = 2( \u2212 ||Xi \u2212 Xj||), where i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n and Xi, Xj represent the state vectors of the system at time ti and tj, respectively. Here,2 is the Heaviside step function and is the size of the small neighborhood area considered around each point in the phase space. When the trajectory returns to the area within the threshold, Rij is marked as 1 and 0 in the recurrence matrix to represent the white and black points in the recurrence plot, respectively. The density of black points in a recurrence plot represents the recurrence rate (RR) in the dynamics of the system and can be obtained as\nRR = 1\n(N0 \u2212 T) 2\nN0\u2212T \u2211\ni,j=1\nRij, (15)\nwhere T = d0\u03c4optFs having value for d0 = 10, \u03c4opt = 0.5 ms, Fs = 2 kHz. The threshold for the recurrence plot was chosen to be = 0.2 and signal was sampled at Fs of 2 kHz for 5 s to get N0 = 10 000. We obtained \u03c4opt (optimum time delay) and d0 (minimum embedding dimension) using average mutual information (AMI) and averaged false nearest neighbor (AFNN) in Ref. 65.\nFigure 10(b) demonstrates the variation of the recurrence rate (RR) of the dynamical state as a function of r. On approaching\nmodel (\u2013) and experiments ( ) during the transition to suppression state in the swirl-controlled combustor.\nof thermoacoustic instability, the density of points in the recurrence plot decreases. This is expected because the number of black points in the recurrence plot would come down as the thermoacoustic instability is reached because the pairwise distances now exceed the threshold more often. We can notice the value of RR is around 0 during the state of thermoacoustic instability, 0.7 during intermittency, and 1 during the suppression state both from the model and experiments. This measure obtained from the experiments is also very well approximated by the model.\nThe close match of the measures (Hp and RR) for the experiments and the model indicates that the nonlinear features of experiments are very well captured by the synchronization model presented here.\nAlthough the model does well in capturing the bifurcation characteristics and aspects of synchronization, it does not capture the higher modes of the spectrum (see Figs. 4 and 5). This is by the construction of the model as we did not consider higher modes in Eq. (2) to keep the analysis simple. Additionally, the prediction of dynamical states on further increase in swirler rotation rate beyond the state of suppression from the model is left for future studies.\nChaos 33, 043104 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0136385 33, 043104-11\nPublished under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing\nD ow nloaded from http://pubs.aip.org/aip/cha/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/5.0136385/16825559/043104_1_5.0136385.pdf"

            "text": "In this paper, we report experiments and modeling of openloop control of thermoacoustic instability in the turbulent combustion system using an actuated swirler. A systematic increase in the rotation rate of the swirler leads to the suppression of limit cycle oscillations as the dynamics of the combustor transitions to lowamplitude aperiodic oscillations through an intermediate state of intermittency. We propose a mean-field synchronization model for the flame response comprising an ensemble of non-identical phase oscillators evolving collectively under the effect of acoustic pressure. The effect of the active swirler is incorporated naturally into the model in terms of the relative time scales of swirler rotation and acoustic frequency. We further implement a parameter identification technique to obtain exact correspondence between the model parameter values and experimental observations. We find that the mapping between the swirler rotation rate in the experiments and the coupling strength in the model manifests as a linear relationship between them.\nThrough a comparison of the bifurcation diagram, time series, probability density functions, and amplitude spectrums, we show that the model replicates the experimentally observed p\u2032 and q\u0307\u2032 fluctuations very well. Further, we show that the model captures the characteristics of spatiotemporal synchronization underlying a transition to the state of suppression while depicting states such as synchronization, chimera, and de-synchronization. In particular, we find that the phase oscillators are synchronized during thermoacoustic instability, partially synchronized during intermittency, and undergo progressive de-synchronization during the suppression. Therefore, we notice a sigmoid-type transition to the suppression state happens through the underlying synchronization. As a consequence, using the mean-field thermoacoustic model, we establish that the active swirler suppresses thermoacoustic oscillations through a de-synchronization transition."

            "text": "To perform the comparison between the experimental and modeling results, we need to normalize the amplitude of acoustic pressure during various states using the amplitude of acoustic pressure at the limit cycle oscillations (LCO). We use the method of averaging66 in the model to determine the amplitude of acoustic pressure during LCO (ALCO). Using the method of averaging, Eq. (6) in the time-domain describes the evolution of pressure fluctuations that can be mapped onto a pair of coupled ordinary differential equations by introducing two slow flow variables: amplitude A and phase 8. This decomposition is commonly known as Kryloff\u2013Bogolyubov decomposition.67 We start by decomposing \u03b7(t) as\n\u03b7(t) = \u2212A(t) cos (t +8(t)) , (A1)\nwhere the amplitude A(t) represents the envelope of the acoustic pressure and the phase 8(t) represents the time-dependent phase shift. Both A(t) and 8(t) are slowly varying quantities because they change on a longer timescale than the period of oscillations of the thermoacoustic mode of interest. Next, we differentiate \u03b7(t) with respect to t,\n\u03b7\u0307(t) = \u2212A\u0307(t) cos (t +8(t))+ A(t) sin (t +8(t))\n+ A(t)8\u0307(t) sin (t +8(t)) . (A2)\nOn expressing \u03b7(t) as a function of A(t) and 8(t) in Eq. (A1), we introduced additional ambiguity in the equation, which can be removed by prescribing an arbitrary relationship between these quantities as: \u2212A\u0307(t) cos (t +8(t))+ A(t)8\u0307(t) sin (t +8(t)) = 0, which in turn leads to a simple expression for \u03b7\u0307(t) of the form\n\u03b7\u0307(t) = A(t) sin (t +8(t)) .

(A5)\nHere, a is a complex function of time, such that a = A(t) ei8(t) and a\u2217 = A(t) e\u2212i8(t), where the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate. We also calculate \u03b7\u0308(t) by differentiating \u03b7\u0307(t)with respect to t and we get\n\u03b7\u0308(t) = \u2212 i\n2\n( a\u0307 eit \u2212 a\u0307\u2217 e\u2212it ) + 1\n2\n( a eit + a\u2217 e\u2212it ) . (A6)\nWe then substitute \u03b7(t), \u03b7\u0307(t), and \u03b7\u0308(t) [Eqs. (A4), (A5), and (A6), respectively] into Eq. (6) and obtain\n\u2212 i ( a\u0307 eit \u2212 a\u0307\u2217 e\u2212it ) + ( a eit + a\u2217 e\u2212it ) \u2212 i\u03b1 ( a eit \u2212 a\u2217 e\u2212it )\n\u2212 ( a eit + a\u2217 e\u2212it ) = \u2212i\u03b2 cos(kzf) N \u2211\ni=1\n( ei(t+\u03b8i(t)) \u2212 e\u2212i(t+\u03b8i(t)) ) .\n(A7) By canceling the second and fourth terms in the above equation and then multiplying the whole equation by e\u2212it, we obtain\n( a\u0307 \u2212 a\u0307\u2217 e\u22122it ) + \u03b1 ( a \u2212 a\u2217 e\u22122it )\n= \u03b2 cos(kzf) N \u2211\ni=1\n( ei\u03b8i(t) \u2212 e\u22122it e\u2212i\u03b8i(t)) ) . (A8)\nNote that a, a\u0307, and their complex conjugate are slow functions of time as compared to the functions e\u00b1nit, where n is an integer. This means that the slow flow variables do not change much during one period of fast oscillations. If we average the whole equation over one period of fast oscillations, i.e., T = 2\u03c0 , we can get rid of the terms corresponding to the fast time scale, and only the terms related to the slow time scale will remain in the equation. The time average f\u0304 of a smooth function f(t) over the time interval T is defined as f\u0304 = 1 T \u222b 2\u03c0 0 f(t) dt. It is easy to see that all the terms containing e \u22122it would integrate to zero over the time oscillation period T. Thus, on applying time averaging on Eq. (A8), we obtain\na\u0307 + \u03b1a = \u03b2 cos(kzf) N \u2211\ni=1\nei\u03b8i(t). (A9)\nRecalling that a = A(t) ei8(t) and substituting it in the above equation, we get\nA\u0307(t) ei8(t) + iA(t)8\u0307(t) ei8(t) + \u03b1A(t) ei8(t) = \u03b2 cos(kzf) N \u2211\ni=1\nei\u03b8i(t).\n(A10)\nOn multiplying Eq. (A10) by e\u2212i8(t) followed by rewriting the exponential term back in the trigonometric quantities and finally, splitting the equation into real and imaginary parts yields the following equations:\nA\u0307(t) = \u03b2 cos(kzf) N \u2211\ni=1\ncos(\u03b8i(t)\u22128(t))\u2212 \u03b1A(t), (A11a)\n8\u0307(t) = \u03b2\nA(t) cos(kzf)\nN \u2211\ni=1\nsin(\u03b8i(t)\u22128(t)). (A11b)\nDuring limit cycle oscillations, we consider A\u0307(t) = 0 and the phase difference between the acoustic pressure and heat release rate is almost zero. Therefore, considering \u03b8i(t)\u22128(t) \u2248 0 in Eq. (A11a) turns out as\nALCO = \u03b2 cos(kzf)N/\u03b1. (A12)\nThis expression of the amplitude of acoustic pressure during thermoacoustic instability is then used for normalizing Eq. (6)."
