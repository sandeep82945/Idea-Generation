DOI: 10.2340/actadv.v103.6548\nDiagnosis: Lymphomatoid papulosis associated with mycosis fungoides\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumours of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues (1, 2), lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) is included in the group of \u201cCD30+\u201d cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders. It is a chronic relapsing, self-healing, papulonodular skin eruption, showing histological features of a cutaneous skin cell lymphoma. Notably, in 10\u201340% of cases, LyP is preceded, simultaneous with, or followed by, a second type of haematological malignancy (HM) (2). Recently, Melchers et al. (3) evaluated the frequency of associated HM in 504 patients affected by LyP, revealing an overall prevalence of 15.5%, with mycosis fungoides (MF) (6.1%) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (5.8%) being the most frequently reported associated HM. In addition, the authors reported an association with other types of HM, including Hodgkin lymphoma, different B-cell neoplasms and myeloid leukaemias, in 3.8% of cases (3). The pathogenetic mechanism underlying the association of LyP with a second neoplasm are unknown. Notably, identical TCR gene rearrangements and oncogenic mutations were found in distinctive lesions of LyP and MF in the same patients, suggesting that both disorders could arise from a common lymphoid progenitor (4). Histologically LyP displays a highly polymorphic pattern, with 5 main pathological subtypes being described (A, B, C, D and E) as well as several other rarer variants. All of these subtypes can be detected during the course of disease in distinct histological specimens taken from the same patient, and occasionally features related to 2 or more variants can be detected in the same skin lesion. In the current case, histological examination revealed the simultaneous presence of features related to type B (MFlike) subtype, such as epidermotropic infiltrate and bandlike dermal infiltrate. A few studies have suggested that subtypes B might be associated with a higher risk of developing a second malignancy, despite the fact that this observation\nwas not confirmed by other researchers (2, 5). As known, in the later stage, patients with MF can occasionally develop papules and nodules with a morphological change of lymphocytes from small/medium to large dimension with possible expression of CD30 (6).\nTherefore, prior to the occurrence of a papule/nodular eruption in a patient affected by MF, differential diagnosis between LyP and large cell transformation MF may be challenging and require an accurate clinical/pathological correlation. Notably, in the current patient the previous appearance of LyP lesions helped in making a confident diagnosis of the associated MF, although the histological pattern of the latter was not specific for cutaneous lymphomas.\nTreatment of LyP is based on a wait-and-see approach, as well as local and systemic treatment, such as topical corticosteroids, psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA), metho trexate, bexarotene or brentuximab, according to the number, size, morphology and distribution of the lesions and the disease course (2). Furthermore, it is important to perform periodic follow-up visits in order to diagnose any secondary lymphomas at an early stage."
