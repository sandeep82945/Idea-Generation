    "abstractText": "Turn of the month (TOM) is a widely recognized anomaly and studied majorly in the context with equity markets. However, the global mutual fund market has not been much exposed to empirical testing of the TOM anomaly and the implication thereof. This study has dual objectives of not only investigating if the TOM effect persists in the world of equity mutual funds but also proposing an investment strategy to exploit the TOM anomaly to mutual fund investors. The study examines 40 equity mutual funds across 6 different geographies and 2 multi-geographic segments. For the sample period of 15 years (2005\u20132020), crucially covering financial crisis as well as an outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic this study confirms a statistically significant effect of TOM for 23 out of 40 funds. Based on findings, the paper proposes a staggered investment strategy to investors in mutual funds for entry and exit to exploit the TOM effect for return enhancement.",

Equity Mutual Funds returns are also influenced by equity market volatility and the NAV of the funds are varying depending on the expectations of the market participants. The persistence of the TOM effect in the world of equity mutual funds can be converted into a prudent investment strategy for mutual fund investors across the globe. An increase in the price of the asset during the last few days of the month & the first few days of the next month is observed, in general, because\nof the significant movement of funds in the market during this period. This argument is in the light of liquidity aspects of domestic and institutional investors during the last few days of the current month and the first few days of the next month. Many researchers have proved the TOM effect hypothesis with the parametric and nonparametric method but yet only a few have explained the economic rationale behind this anomaly. The flow of liquidity via trading of stocks to rebalance the portfolio by pension fund managers and other institutional investors was the main reason cited by Lakonishok and Smidt (1988) for explaining the economic phenomenon behind the liquidity argument. Another very common argument is about salary date in the month-end period and auto-debit of investment into mutual funds by many retail investors leading toward heavy liquidity flow in the market. This paper examines 40 equity mutual funds across 6 different geographies and 2 multi-geographic segments for the sample period of 15 years (2005\u20132020), crucially covering financial crisis as well as an outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic to check the TOM effect and discuss the possibility of designing the investment strategy in equity mutual funds using such anomaly.\nThis paper is segregated into sub-sections where Sect.\u00a02 elaborates the review of literature, Sect.\u00a03 discusses the data\n* Tirthank Shah tirthanks@gmail.com\nNarayan Baser Narayan.Baser@spm.pdpu.ac.in\n1 Institute of\u00a0Management, Nirma University, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India\n2 School of\u00a0Petroleum Management, Pandit Deendayal Energy University, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India\nand research methodology, Sect.\u00a04 deliberates on the empirical findings based on testing and proposes an investment strategy and the last Sect.\u00a05 presents the closing remarks and future scope of the research work."

            "heading": "Literature review",
            "text": "A very pioneering study was done by Ariel (1987) where he calculated mean returns for the before and during the first half of the month (\u2212\u00a09, +\u00a09) and mean return for the rest of the days to prove the TOM return pattern in US stock index. Jacobs and Levy (1988) also supported the TOM effect for the US market. Lakonishok and Smidt (1988) used 90 years of returns on the DJIA index and reported strong evidence for the TOM effect with its rationale. The study found a higher cumulative return at the turn of the month (\u2212\u00a04, +\u00a04), which is higher than the average cumulative return of the whole month. The impact of TOM with empirical data and explanation of the TOM phenomenon both together is discussed by Ogden (1990) with the help of the very famous hypothesis of \u201cStandardisation of Payment System\u201d that influence the rise in liquidity in the market at the turn of each month in US market. The same idea was carried forward by Ziemba (1991) in the Japanese market to deliver the theory of the \u201cpreferred habitat\u201d of investment as investors reinvest their profits again in the market. The study made an interesting observation of the early effect of TOM (\u2212\u00a05, +\u00a02) in Japan as their salaries are paid five days in advance compared to other international markets. Cadsby and Ratner (1992) had conducted a study on 10 countries including the US and UK and reported a significant TOM effect in a few countries while the study could not establish the TOM effect in France, Japan, Italy and Hong Kong. The cash and derivatives market also has a TOM effect (\u2212\u00a05, \u2212\u00a01) and was reported by Martikainen et\u00a0al. (1995) using Finnish market data. Booth et\u00a0al. (2001) also studied market data of the Helsinki Stock Exchange in Finland to find out the reason for the TOM and it supported the arguments of rising in liquidity at month-end given by Ogden (1990). It was observed that institutional investors do selling of loss-making stocks and buying profit-making stocks at the month-end period to show good performance to their clients and that induces more liquidity in the market. Thaler (1987) Barone (1990) has examined this argument and termed it as \u201cWindow dressing hypothesis\u201d and \u201cPortfolio rebalancing hypothesis.\u201d Many researchers proved seasonal effects and calendar anomalies in various global equity markets and also suggested a profitable investment strategy based on these findings as long as transaction cost (Marquering et\u00a0al. 2006) is smaller than the gross profit of the strategy. Jones (2002) and Lesmond et\u00a0al. (1999) had studied the reduction in transaction cost over a period of time and how it varies by the size\nof the firm and other variables. Hensel and Ziemba (1996) and Kunkel and Compton (1998) also stated about \u201cSwitching Strategy\u201d to maximize the return from TOM effect with reduced volatility rather na\u00efve buy and hold strategy. Intensive research with the data of most of the international equity market, the TOM phenomena has received a global presence. Kunkel et\u00a0al. (2003) proved a significant (87%) TOM effect (\u2212\u00a04, +\u00a04 days) in sixteen major markets of the world with the data of 1988\u20132000. Indian stock market has also shown the TOM effect in the study conducted by Freund, Jain and Puri (2007) with the data of leading stock exchange of India\u2014NSE for the period of 1992\u20132004. Nikkinen et\u00a0al. (2007) had reported that the TOM effect in the SP100 is induced because most of the macroeconomics news is announced at the end of the month which is similar to the reason stated by Penman (1987) observation of corporate earnings announcement of US companies in the first half of the calendar month. McConnell and Xu (2008) have studied CRSP index data for 1987 to 2005 to reconfirm the TOM effect (\u2212\u00a01, +\u00a03) in most of the global economies but they contradicted the argument of Odgen (1990) by showing no significant trading volume and funds liquidity flow. Zwergel (2010) also discovered the TOM effect and showed that a TOM-based trading strategy outperforms even after adjusting for transaction cost. McGuinness and Harris (2011) studied three Chinese markets and compared significant TOM effects along with lunar the new-year return effects. TOM was not only examined in equity markets but also in the ETF market along with suggestive trading strategies to optimize returns for the investors. Chen and Chua (2011) and Chen et\u00a0al. (2015) suggested the \u201cswitching strategy\u201d of T-bill during the non-TOM period otherwise investing into SPDR ETF for higher Sharpe ratio for varying levels of risk aversion of investors. Sharma and Narayan (2014) examined 560 firms of NYSE for the period 2000\u20132008 and found the size-wise and sector-wise different TOM effects in all 14 sectors under the study. Aziz and Ansari (2017) examined 12 major AsiaPacific markets during the period of 2000\u20132015 covering the period of the financial crisis and reported the TOM effect in 11 markets of the Asia-Pacific region. Arendas and Kotlebova (2019) investigated the TOM effect in the stock markets of 11 Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries for a 20-year period (1999\u20132018) and proved significant TOM in seven countries. A study by Singh et\u00a0al. (2021) has focused on emerging markets namely Brazil, China and India for the testing turn of the month effect for equity markets with three different sub-time periods which has pointed that significant higher average returns for the turn of the month were generated as compared to non-turn of the month time period.\nThough a variety of literature is available to verify the TOM effects in equity and other markets but very few handful of studies are available in the equity mutual funds market. The funds flow in the Mutual fund market also has\na seasonality impact. Choi (2015) established the turn of the year effect in cash flows to US domestic mutual funds with the highest net cash flows in January while lowest in December. This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature and examine the presence of the TOM effect in the global mutual funds market and suggest an investment strategy to maximize the return."

Out of these six segments, three developed market segments were selected namely USA, Europe and Japan while the other three segments were emerging market segments namely India, China, Latin America. Emerging market-theme and International market-theme were identified as multi-geographic segments. For every segment top five open-ended equity mutual fund schemes were selected based on their asset under management from MutualFunds.com. For all forty equity mutual fund schemes, the net asset value (NAV) data of daily frequency was extracted from Yahoo finance for the time period starting from 1stAug.-2005 till 31st-July-2020. The NAV data for respective funds is before the adjustment of any income distributed and after the adjustment of any \u201cswing pricing\u201d or \u201centry/ exit load\u201d for moving capital in or out of the fund. This fifteen years\u2019 time period crucially covered the entire economic cycle, the financial crisis of 2008 and the outbreak of the Covid-19 Pandemic. Based on daily NAV data, log returns were calculated for every scheme."

            "text": "An extensive literature review has suggested that various studies have defined the turn of the month window differently. Studies, such as Lakonishok and Smidt (1988), Ogden (1990), Cadsby and Ratner (1992), have opted for the turn of the month window as the last trading day of a month and the first three trading days of next month denoted as (\u2212\u00a01, + 3). Other studies have explored different turn of the month window to empirical testing such as Ziemba (1991) has applied (\u2212\u00a05, +\u00a02) days window, Kayacetin and Lekpek (2016) have used (\u2212\u00a02, +\u00a04) days window and so forth. To represent diverse interest for various windows this study has applied two windows one being (\u2212\u00a01, +\u00a03) days where days from the last trading day of the month till 3rd trading day of the next month is considered as TOM window and all other trading\ndays are considered to be Rest of the Month (ROM) window and another window being (\u2212\u00a07, +\u00a07) which encompasses all other window intervals.\nDaily log returns based on NAV data was calculated as per the formula given below;\nwhere Ri,t is the return of a particular mutual fund scheme on day t, Pi,t is the closing NAV price of the mutual fund scheme on day t and Pi,t\u22121 is the closing NAV price of the mutual fund scheme on day t\u00a0\u2212\u00a01.\nIn order to test if returns generated during the turn of the month window days (ToM) is statistically significant or not against the returns generated during the rest of the month days (ROM), OLS regression analysis is applied which is in line with studies such as Kunkel et\u00a0al. (2003), Kumar (2015), Aziz and Ansari (2017). Following OLS regression equation is applied for empirical testing purpose;\nwhere \u03b1i represents the returns during the rest of the month days when the dummy value supplied would be zero. \u03b2i represents additional returns for the turn of the month days generated over the returns for the rest of the month days. Dit represents a dummy variable that takes a value of zero for the rest of the month days and a value of one for the turn of the month days and eit is the error term.\nMany empirical studies have confirmed that equity asset\u2019s return distribution may not show normal distribution. With consideration that equity mutual fund returns may also indicate non-normal distribution, the study has performed Wilcoxson signed rank test (WSR) as a nonparametric test to validate if returns generated during the turn of the month days window has any statistical significance against returns generated during the rest of the month days."

A descriptive statistics table for all the mutual funds based on fifteen years\u2019 time period is given in Table\u00a01. The study has found based on OLS regression analysis for the turn of the month window of (\u2212\u00a01, +\u00a03) that majority of equity mutual funds from emerging market segments namely India, China, Latin America and emerging segment -theme have shown\n(1)Ri,t = ln [ P i,t\nP i,t\u22121\n]\n\u00d7100\n(2)Rit = i + iDit + eit\nstatistical significant returns generation at a significance level of 5% as indicated in Table\u00a02. Also, the two mediansized funds based on the net asset under management were selected in each category to observe if the size of the fund affects the existence of the TOM effect and how strong the TOM effect was for the larger-sized fund and median-sized fund in the same category. On both these fronts, the study found that median-sized funds demonstrated similar results when compared to larger-sized funds. However, to draw any substantial inferences much larger study is required.\nOn a similar line regression analysis was run for the turn of the month window of (\u2212\u00a07, + 7), where findings are echoing the same outcome that emerging markets mutual funds are having statistical significance at 5% level as shown in Table\u00a03.\nWSR test was performed to test if the median of the difference between returns generated during the turn of the month days window and returns generated during the rest of the month days has any statistical significance. WDR test for the turn of the month winds of (\u2212\u00a01, b\u00a03) has confirmed for statistical significance for the turn of the month window only in the case of a few emerging mutual funds as indicated in Table\u00a04.\nSimilarly, the WSR test was run for the turn of the month window of (\u2212\u00a07, +\u00a07), where findings stated that for the majority of mutual funds from emerging market segments have shown statistical significance in favor of the turn of the month window which is indicated in the Table\u00a05.\na Shows statistical significance at 5% for turn of the month returns b Represents median sized fund based on net asset under management\nReturn enhancing strategy aligned with\u00a0monthly systematic investment plan and\u00a0systematic withdrawal plan\nEmpirical testing has suggested that the emerging markets are more prone to demonstrate the turn of the month effects for both the windows with the context of equity mutual fund schemes. Twenty-three funds that have demonstrated a statistically significant difference for (\u2212\u00a01, +\u00a03) window in favor of the Turn of the Month (TOM) effect, have been identified to measure NAV price difference between ROM window and TOM window.\nThe average NAV price of 23 funds for the TOM window and ROM window along with the percentage difference of these two NAV is exhibited in the Table\u00a06 as below, where the average of all the NAV price falls between the 4th of the month and the 29th of the month as ROM window is taken and for TOM window average of all the NAV price falls between 30th of the month and 3rd of next month is considered for the entire sample time period.\nThis study based on generated inference proposes a return enhancing strategy to exploit evident turn of the month effect especially for retail investors and institutional investors. A systematic investment plan (SIP) is a staggered investment strategy where the investor invests a fixed monetary amount at the NAV on a pre-determined date and frequency in the specified mutual fund where this exercise will be recurring in nature on monthly basis. Hence, the investor may buy through SIP on monthly basis by deliberately selecting\na Shows statistical significance at 5% for turn of the month returns b Represents median sized fund based on net asset under management\ndates that are falling in the ROM window (from 4th to 29th) which may lead to a lower average NAV purchase price. Same way, while withdrawing the fund in staggered manner, the investor can opt for a systematic withdrawal plan (SWP) mode where the investor withdraws on monthly basis on dates that are falling in the TOM window (30th to 3rd of next month) which may lead to higher average NAV sell price. Hence, looking at the percentage difference between average NAV price on ROM and TOM window the strategy can be proposed that buying units on monthly basis during the ROM window may lead to the lower average cost of buying due to lower NAV on these dates, while selling the units on monthly basis during TOM window may lead to the higher average price of selling eventually resulting into return enhancing strategy just by better date selection without any additional cost implication.\nFor the above 23 mutual funds with (\u2212\u00a01, +\u00a03) window, the study also observed (see the figure under the appendix) that 17 mutual funds have shown higher average returns generated during the TOM window for the calendar year-end month of December as compared to average returns generated during other months. This may hint toward the impact of the turn of the calendar year effect which can be further explored as an extension to the current study.\na Shows statistical significance at 5% for turn of the month returns b Represents median sized fund based on net asset under management"

            "text": "The turn of the month effect is tested for many markets over the past few decades. However, the global equity mutual fund market has not attracted much attention to testing turn of the month anomaly. This study based on the identified forty equity mutual fund schemes representing six different geographical segments and two multi-geographical segments for the time period of fifteen years, has inferred that the turn of the month is persistence in two different windows for the majority of emerging markets based on statistical significance generated through regression analysis as well as Wilcoxson signed rank test. The study has proposed the staggered investment strategy to exploit turn of the month anomaly in emerging markets where the investor can buy units on the date which is falling during the ROM window to lower the average purchase cost and sell units on the date which is falling during TOM window to get higher average selling price resulting into return enhancing strategy without any cost addition.\nThe future scope of such study may be explored where along with the turn of the month anomaly, calendar year end anomaly or day of the week anomaly can be tested. Also, other asset markets within the mutual fund can be subject to testing such as a bond or hybrid mutual funds. The extension of this work can also be explored in the direction of studying the impact of size of the fund on the TOM effect. Testing such anomalies in the mutual fund market can be the first step in a direction to devise better strategies to exploit if such anomalies persist.\na Shows statistical significance at 5% for turn of the month returns b Represents median sized fund based on net asset under management"
