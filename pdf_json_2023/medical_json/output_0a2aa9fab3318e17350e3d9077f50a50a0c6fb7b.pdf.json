Among COVID-19 patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), disease severity is increased with associated higher mortality risk.1,2 In the TurCoviDia study, 30-day mortality was increased among COVID-19 patients with T2DM. Furthermore, older age, male gender, obesity, insulin treatment, lymphopenia and pulmonary involvement on admission were independently associated with mortality.3 In the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and Diabetes Outcomes study (CORONADO), diabetes-related phenotypes were investigated to determine their association with admitted\npatients with COVID-19. In the same study, body mass index (BMI), not the long-term glucose control, was independently associated with the severity of COVID-19.4 Although the exact mechanism remains unclear, the dysregulated immune and inflammatory response of the host with COVID-19 and T2DM has been implicated.5 Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with T2DM, COVID-19 increases the risk of poor glycemic control.\nIn COVID-19, inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), ferritin, D-dimer, procalcitonin, high-sensitivity C-reactive peptide (hs-CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are used to assess disease prognosis.

After screening, 109 patient records passed the eligibility criteria. Data were collected and reviewed retrospectively from the medical records section of the University of Santo Tomas Hospital. Medical data were recorded using a data collection form, and each patient was assigned a numerical code. Computations for glycemic control indices and glycemic variability were derived from CBG monitoring of admitted patients during their 72 hours of hospital stay. Data analysis was handled by a biostatistician. The following were the independent variables observed in the study: 1) laboratory profile including absolute lymphocyte count, platelet count, SGOT, SGPT, serum creatinine; and HbA1c; 2) inflammatory markers including hs-CRP, LDH, IL-6, serum ferritin, procalcitonin and D-dimer. Co-variates observed were as follows: 1) demographics including age, sex, weight and body mass index using the Asia-Pacific classification; 2) comorbidities including hypertension, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, immunodeficient state, chronic kidney disease, chronic respiratory disease, chronic liver disease, chronic heart failure, active tuberculosis, active malignancy and hematologic disease; 3) steroid-induced hyperglycemia \u2013 defined as new-onset inpatient hyperglycemia above 180 mg/dL or worsening of current glycemic control above 180 mg/dL, 24 hours after initiation of corticosteroids in patient with T2DM, 4) COVID-19 disease severity including moderate, severe and critical COVID-19 and 5) hyperglycemia inpatient therapy including the use of metformin, sulfonylurea, thiazolidinediones, sodiumglucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP4i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP1 RA), multidose basal bolus insulin therapy including the total daily dose expressed in units/kg/day, basal insulin only, bolus insulin only, premixed insulin and insulin drip.\nCOVID-19 disease severity was defined as 1) moderate, if the patient had signs of non-severe pneumonia (e.g., fever, cough, dyspnea, or difficulty of breathing), respiratory rate 21-30 breaths/min, SpO2 >92% on room air is present; 2) severe, if the patient had severe pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection (fever, cough, dyspnea, respiratory rate >30 breaths/minute, severe respiratory distress or SpO2 \u226492% on room air); and 3) critical, if the patient presented with COVID-Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, sepsis or septic shock.8\nThe following are the observed dependent variables: 1) glycemic control indices9,10 including a) glucose mean defined as the average of daily glucose value computed within 72 hours of hospital stay; b) glucose maximum, minimum and 50th percentile (median) values as derived\nand glycemic variability in patients with COVID-19 and T2DM are yet to be established. Optimal glycemic variability (blood glucose within 70 to 180 mg/dL) was associated with lower mortality than poorly controlled blood glucose.6 Since poor glycemic variability is associated with increased mortality, early intensification of treatment might be needed, hence necessitating the identification of the predictors for poor glucose control and increased glucose variability. This study aimed to identify the predictors for poor glycemic control indices and increased glucose variability among patients with moderate to critical COVID-19 infection and T2DM admitted to a tertiary hospital in Manila, Philippines. In addition, this study hypothesized that the inflammatory markers including procalcitonin, hsCRP, LDH, D-Dimer, ferritin and IL-6 are associated with poor glycemic control and increased glucose variability."

Among these patients, 78% developed poor glycemic control and/or increased glucose variability, while 22% had no poor outcomes. Mean age was 59 (range 47-64) years and sex distribution (male n = 62, 56.8% vs female n = 47, 43.1%) between the groups was not statistically significant. Obese body mass index (mean 28.0, range 22-34) was observed between both sexes with hypertension (n = 82, 75.2%) as the leading comorbidity. In terms of severity, 28% were classified as moderate, 19% were classified as severe and 52% were classified as critical. Steroid use was frequently observed in the poor outcome group (n = 61, 82.43%). Patients with severe and critical COVID-19 were frequently found to have poor glycemic outcomes compared to those with moderate COVID-19 (19 [22.35%], 48 [56.47%] vs 2 [8.33%], 9 [37.5%] p = 0.009).\nIn the laboratory profile of COVID-19 patients, the poor outcome group had statistically significant higher HbA1c levels (7.82 [6.96-10.28], p = 0.002). For the inflammatory markers, there was an increased trend in median hs-CRP in the poor outcome group compared to the other group, however, it did not reach statistical significance (116.29 [36.52-210] vs 50.38 [22.1-136.5] p = 0.059). The use of DPP4i and multiple basal-bolus insulin injections were more frequent in the poor outcome group. Moreover, the total daily insulin dose is higher in the poor outcome group (1 [0.6-1.3] vs 0.4 [0.1-1.1] p = 0.034). The clinical, demographic, laboratory, inflammatory marker and inpatient hyperglycemic therapy profiles are listed in Table 1.\nIn the poor outcome group, patients had higher glucose mean, glucose maximum, glucose minimum and glucose median values. Likewise, the hyperglycemia index (1.5 [0.9-2.87] vs 0.14 [0.03-0.34] p<0.001) and percentage above range (55 [44-73] vs 11 [10-20] p<0.001) was higher in the poor outcome group. Hypoglycemia was only observed in the poor outcome group, as seen in the percentage below range and hypoglycemia index. As expected, patients in the good outcome group had higher target-in-range percentages compared to the poor outcome group (100 [89.5-100] vs 46 [31-56] p<0.001). The glycemic control indices profile is listed in Table 2.\nHyperglycemia is frequently observed in the study population. Nonetheless, acceptable glycemic variability is observed. The patient outcomes are listed in Table 3.\nCOVID-19 patients on DPP4i alone were 69.71% less likely to have poor glycemic control indices. However, patients on basal-bolus insulin therapy were 10.5 times more likely to have poor glycemic control indices.

            "text": "T2DM has been described as a state of chronic low-grade inflammation and it is known that CRP, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and other cytokines are elevated in T2DM.14 Upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, this preexisting chronic inflammation is further augmented leading to a heightened inflammatory response. Comorbidities including hypertension, dyslipidemia, advancing age, cardiovascular disease and obesity contribute to the ongoing inflammation which leads to hyperimmune response and increased severity of COVID-19.2,14 Poorly controlled T2DM has been reported in several studies as a poor prognostic factor for COVID-19.1-4 Indeed, local and international guidelines were created to address hyperglycemia in COVID-19. This retrospective study was designed to: 1) Describe the demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory profiles, including inflammatory markers of patients with moderate to critical COVID-19 infection and T2DM; and 2) Show the correlation of the identified predictors with glycemic control and variability. This study showed that baseline HbA1c and hs-CRP are potential risk factors for hyperglycemia and poor glycemic variability. Of interest, COVID-19 severity, including severe and critical COVID-19 are predictors of hyperglycemia as well. Chronic kidney disease is likewise a predictor of poor variability. To the researcher\u2019s knowledge, this is the first study to show the association of having poor glycemic control indices also increase twelvefold. For every mg/L increase in the patient\u2019s hsCRP, the odds of having poor glycemic control indices also increased by 0.74%, and for every percent increase in the patient\u2019s HbA1c, the odds of having poor glycemic indices also increased by 86.43%. Patients on steroids were 71.2 times more likely to have poor glycemic control indices. In terms of COVID-19 severity, patients with severe COVID-19 were 8.9 times more likely to have poor glycemic control indices compared to patients with moderate COVID-19. Patients with critical COVID-19 were 4.4 times more likely to have poor glycemic control indices compared to patients with moderate COVID-19. Factors associated with poor glycemic control indices are listed in Table 4. COVID-19 patients with chronic kidney disease were 2.8 times more likely to have increased glycemic variability. In addition, the odds of increased glycemic variability decrease by 2.11% for every ml/min/1.73m2 increase in eGFR. For every U/L increase in SGPT, the odds of having increased glycemic variability decrease by 3.85%. Patients on thiazolidinediones were 14.9 times more likely to have\nTable 5.

The association of AST was weaker than GGT in terms of hyperglycemia.20 Elevated ALT, AST and GGT were not correlated with higher glycemic variability.20 Decreased glucose disposal was probably the mechanism of hyperglycemia in patients with elevated liver enzymes.20 In this study, patients with elevated SGPT were less likely to have poor glycemic variability, compared to the Noordam study. However, elevated SGPT and SGOT did not show an association with hyperglycemia in the present study. Noordam found that GGT is probably related to glucose metabolism as compared with SGPT and SGOT.20 This probably explains the poor correlation of SGPT and SGOT to hyperglycemia. Further investigation is needed to prove this association.\nAs expected, the presence of steroid hyperglycemia showed the strongest correlation with hyperglycemia. Among the comorbidities, chronic kidney disease was associated with poor glycemic variability probably due to impaired glucose metabolism in these patients.\nElevated body mass index did not show an association with poor glycemic control indices and increased glycemic variability in the present study.\nIn the study population, DPP4i and basal-bolus insulin therapy were the most frequently used anti-hyperglycemic agents for COVID-19. DPP4i use was associated with improved glycemic control, however, the true correlation regarding the association with glycemic control cannot be determined. Patients who were admitted presenting with mild hyperglycemia were started with DPP4i as compared with those patients presenting with severe hyperglycemia where additional hypoglycemic agents, including insulin, were added. The causal relationship cannot be ascertained, that is whether the improved glycemic control was brought about by DPP4i use or that the baseline characteristics of the patients started on DPP4i had only modest glucose elevations resulting in improved control. Other oral hypoglycemic agents such as metformin, SGLT2i and thiazolidinediones did not show any correlation with good glucose control, possibly due to low frequency of and much later use in the study population. Of note, thiazolidinediones, specifically pioglitazone, were associated with poor glycemic variability as TZDs are known to lower glucose levels in approximately 2 weeks.21 Pioglitazone works by activation of nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated \u03b3 receptor hence, its glycemic effects cannot be immediately seen. Basal-bolus insulin therapy was associated with hyperglycemia, however, patients who were started on this regimen may have had severe hyperglycemia at baseline. The full therapeutic property of basal-bolus insulin therapy may not have been observed immediately during the initial 72 hours resulting in hyperglycemia. In addition, steroid-induced hyperglycemia, a possible confounder, may have affected the results.\nof clinical, laboratory, and inflammatory marker profiles to glycemic control indices and variability for patients with T2DM and COVID-19.\nAmong hospitalized patients, the coexistence of T2DM and COVID-19 may lead to poor blood glucose control and variability. It was observed that during the first 72 hours of admission, there was frequent hyperglycemia, low occurrence of hypoglycemia and good glycemic variability among the study population. This glycemic pattern is similar to the study of Cheng where hyperglycemia on admission was associated with disease severity in COVID-19.2 Critical COVID-19 was frequently observed in the present study.\nPatients with T2DM are in a state of low-grade chronic inflammation, and concomitant COVID-19 infection can induce high levels of cytokines including IL-6, IL1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, MCP-1 and inducible protein-10 that confers a high degree of insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia.15,16 In addition, high IL-6 level, an index of hypercytokinemia, correlated with hyperglycemia and difficulties with glycemic control.17 However, this study, did not show an association between IL-6 and hyperglycemia and glycemic variability. IL-6 is shown to be elevated both in poor and good outcome groups. Further studies with a bigger sample size should be done to further explore an association between IL-6 and hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients.\nIn contrast, in a study of COVID-19 patients with T2DM, a lower incidence of elevated serum CRP has been observed among patients with well-controlled blood glucose.6 In the same study, elevated HbA1c was observed in the poor blood glucose control group. This study showed an association between the risk of hyperglycemia and increased hsCRP and HbA1c on admission. It may be suggested that stringent glycemic control should be observed in COVID-19 patients with elevated baseline HbA1c and hs-CRP. Other inflammatory markers including procalcitonin, LDH and D-Dimer were observed to be elevated in COVID-19 patients with T2DM.1,2 However, these inflammatory markers were not associated with poor glycemic control and increased glycemic variability in the present study. The inflammatory markers in previous studies were used as tools for prognostication of COVID-19 severity and not as predictors for poor glycemic control and increased variability.18,19 Further studies are needed to show the direct correlation of procalcitonin, LDH and D-dimer to glycemic control in COVID-19 patients. Although these inflammatory markers did not show an association with the studied outcomes, COVID-19 severity showed a correlation with hyperglycemia.\nLaboratory profiles including absolute lymphocyte count, platelet count and SGOT did not show an association with poor glycemic control indices and increased variability. In a study by Noordam et al., the researchers analyzed the association of elevated liver enzyme concentration with glycemic variability and hyperglycemia in individuals without diabetes mellitus.

Blood glucose monitoring was tested using a capillary blood glucose meter. To minimize changes in glucose variability, patients should be on at least 4-point CBG monitoring (e.g., three times a day before meals and at bedtime), similar to the study done by Tura et al.9 However, continuous glucose monitoring is still recommended as more data points are required to obtain more accurate glucometrics such as percentage of target glucose in range, percentage above target range, percentage below target range, SD and CV. However, a strength of this study is that it reflects the commonly used modality of blood glucose monitoring in inpatient settings. Another limitation is that because of the study\u2019s observational nature, no causality was ascertained. Also, the researchers failed to create a multivariate model due to the low number of variables left after the stepwise approach. Increasing the sample size may improve this limitation. The researchers recommend doing prospective studies using continuous glucose monitoring to reflect the complete inter- and intraday blood glucose variations."
