1. **Investigate the effect of different types of time pressure on QE characteristics.** The current study manipulated time pressure by instructing participants to perform shots within a specific time limit. However, there are other ways to induce time pressure, such as having participants compete against an opponent or having them perform shots under the pressure of a ticking clock. Future research could investigate how different types of time pressure affect QE characteristics.


2. **Examine the effect of different types of performance pressure on QE characteristics.** The current study manipulated performance pressure by instructing participants that their shots would be evaluated by a public ranking. However, there are other ways to induce performance pressure, such as having participants perform shots in front of an audience or having them perform shots for a monetary reward. Future research could investigate how different types of performance pressure affect QE characteristics.


3. **Explore the relationship between QE characteristics and shooting accuracy in different game situations.** The current study found that competitive elites had higher shooting accuracy than semi-elites, but it did not find a statistically significant effect of time or performance pressure on shooting accuracy. However, it is possible that time and performance pressure could affect shooting accuracy in different game situations. For example, time pressure might have a greater impact on shooting accuracy in the final seconds of a close game, while performance pressure might have a greater impact on shooting accuracy in a game that is being televised. Future research could investigate the relationship between QE characteristics and shooting accuracy in different game situations.


4. **Investigate the neural mechanisms underlying QE.** The current study did not investigate the neural mechanisms underlying QE. However, there is some evidence to suggest that QE is associated with activity in the frontal eye fields, the supplementary motor area, and the basal ganglia. Future research could use neuroimaging techniques to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying QE.


5. **Develop QE training protocols to improve shooting accuracy.** The current study found that competitive elites had longer QE online duration than semi-elites, particularly when time and performance pressure were present. This suggests that QE training could be used to improve shooting accuracy. Future research could develop QE training protocols and investigate their effectiveness in improving shooting accuracy.
