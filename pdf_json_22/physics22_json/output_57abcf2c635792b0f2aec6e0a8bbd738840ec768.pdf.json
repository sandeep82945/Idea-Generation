    "abstractText": "Loosely speaking, the Mpemba effect appears when hotter systems cool sooner or, in a more abstract way, when systems further from equilibrium relax faster. In this paper, we investigate the Mpemba effect in a molecular gas with nonlinear drag, both analytically (by employing the tools of kinetic theory) and numerically (direct simulation Monte Carlo of the kinetic equation and event-driven molecular dynamics). The analysis is carried out via two alternative routes, recently considered in the literature: first, the kinetic or thermal route, in which the Mpemba effect is characterized by the crossing of the evolution curves of the kinetic temperature (average kinetic energy), and, second, the stochastic thermodynamics or entropic route, in which the Mpemba effect is characterized by the crossing of the distance to equilibrium in probability space. In general, a nonmutual correspondence between the thermal and entropic Mpemba effects is found, i.e., there may appear the thermal effect without its entropic counterpart or vice versa. Furthermore, a nontrivial overshoot with respect to equilibrium of the thermal relaxation makes it necessary to revise the usual definition of the thermal Mpemba effect, which is shown to be better described in terms of the relaxation of the local equilibrium distribution. Our theoretical framework, which involves an extended Sonine approximation in which not only the excess kurtosis but also the sixth cumulant is retained, gives an excellent account of the behavior observed in simulations.",

In this paper, we investigate the Mpemba effect in a molecular gas with nonlinear drag, both analytically (by employing the tools of kinetic theory) and numerically (direct simulation Monte Carlo of the kinetic equation and event-driven molecular dynamics). The analysis is carried out via two alternative routes, recently considered in the literature: first, the kinetic or thermal route, in which the Mpemba effect is characterized by the crossing of the evolution curves of the kinetic temperature (average kinetic energy), and, second, the stochastic thermodynamics or entropic route, in which the Mpemba effect is characterized by the crossing of the distance to equilibrium in probability space. In general, a nonmutual correspondence between the thermal and entropic Mpemba effects is found, i.e., there may appear the thermal effect without its entropic counterpart or vice versa. Furthermore, a nontrivial overshoot with respect to equilibrium of the thermal relaxation makes it necessary to revise the usual definition of the thermal Mpemba effect, which is shown to be better described in terms of the relaxation of the local equilibrium distribution. Our theoretical framework, which involves an extended Sonine approximation in which not only the excess kurtosis but also the sixth cumulant is retained, gives an excellent account of the behavior observed in simulations.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.105.054140\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, memory effects have become a hot topic in nonequilibrium statistical physics research [1]. Those phenomena usually imply counterintuitive effects that apparently contradict well-established standard physical laws. One of the most interesting is the Mpemba effect (ME): Given two samples of a fluid in a common thermal bath, the initially hotter one may cool more rapidly than that initially cooler. The well-known Newton\u2019s law of cooling, according to which the temperature evolution is predetermined by its initial value, is thus violated in the presence of the ME. Original studies of the ME deal with water [2\u201332], and even today there is still a lack of consensus about its existence in this very complex system [33\u201335].\nIn a more general context, the ME can be recast as \u201cthe initially further from equilibrium relaxes faster,\u201d with the separation from equilibrium being defined in a suitable way, see below. With such an interpretation, Mpemba-like effects have been investigated in a large variety of many-body systems: molecular gases [36,37], mixtures [38], granular gases [39\u201345], inertial suspensions [46,47], spin glasses [48],\n*albertom@unex.es \u2020andres@unex.es \u2021prados@us.es\ncarbon nanotube resonators [49], clathrate hydrates [50], Markovian models [51\u201355], active systems [56], Ising models [57\u201359], non-Markovian mean-field systems [60,61], or quantum systems [62]. Very recently, the ME has been analyzed in the framework of Landau\u2019s theory of phase transitions [63]. Also, it has been experimentally observed in colloids [64,65].\nThere have been two main approaches to the ME: the kinetic-theory or \u201cthermal\u201d approach [36\u201344,46,47] and the stochastic-process (or thermodynamics) or \u201centropic\u201d approach [51\u201356,62,64,65]. In the thermal approach, kinetic theory makes it possible to define in a natural way an outof-equilibrium time-dependent temperature T (t ) as basically the average kinetic energy, i.e.,\nT (t ) = m dkB \u3008v2\u3009, (1)\nwhere d is the dimensionality of the system, m is the mass of a particle, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. This definition allows for a simple, and close in spirit to the original studies in water, characterization of the separation from equilibrium at temperature Teq: The initially hotter (colder) sample A (B) translates into that having the larger (smaller) initial value of the kinetic temperature, T 0A > T 0 B > Teq. A thermal Mpemba effect (TME) is observed if the evolution curves for the temperature cross at a certain time t\u03b8 , TA(t\u03b8 ) = TB(t\u03b8 ), and that of the initially hotter remains below the other one for longer\n2470-0045/2022/105(5)/054140(24) 054140-1 \u00a92022 American Physical Society\ntimes, Teq < TA(t ) < TB(t ) for t > t\u03b8 . Additionally, a Mpemba effect may exist in the absence of a temperature crossing if TB(t ) overshoots the equilibrium value at a certain time tO, i.e., TB(tO) = Teq, then reaches a minimum, and finally relaxes to equilibrium later than sample A. This overshoot effect would be the analog of the supercooling phenomenon in water.\nIn the stochastic-process approach, the starting point is usually a Markov process x(t ). The state of the system at time t is determined by a probability distribution P(x, t ), which typically obeys a master equation, for discrete x, or a Fokker-Planck equation, for continuous x. The KullbackLeibler divergence (KLD) or relative entropy [66] is defined as\nD(t ) \u2261 \u2329 ln P\nPeq\n\u232a = \u222b dx P(x, t ) ln\nP(x, t ) Peq(x) , (2)\nwhere Peq(x) stands for the equilibrium probability distribution. The H-theorem [67] ensures that D(t ) monotonically decreases to zero over a nonequilibrium process and thus D(t ) can be interpreted as the distance to equilibrium from a physical standpoint [68]. Also, D can be understood as (the opposite of) the nonequilibrium entropy relative to the equilibrium state. The ME is translated as follows in this context: The further from (closer to) sample A (B) has the larger (smaller) initial value of D, i.e., D0A > D0B > 0. The entropic Mpemba effect (EME) emerges when the evolution curves for D cross at a certain time tD, DA(tD ) = DB(tD ), and 0 < DA(t ) < DB(t ) for t > tD.\nThe two effects described above, TME and EME, are equivalent if a biunivocal correspondence between nonequilibrium temperature and (entropic) distance to equilibrium exists. Yet, this is not the case in general, as we will show. In fact, the main aim of this paper is to analyze the correspondence between the TME and the EME in a prototypical system, where the two approaches can be carried out analytically\u2014at least in an approximate, systematic way. Specifically, we consider a molecular gas of hard particles that is coupled to a thermal bath, with the resulting drag force being nonlinear in the velocity [36]. In addition, there are binary elastic collisions between the particles. See Fig. 1 for an illustration of the system. The evolution equation of the velocity distribution function (VDF) is given by the EnskogFokker-Planck equation (EFPE)\u2014the Enskog term accounts for binary collisions, whereas the Fokker-Planck term models the interaction with the thermal bath, see Sec. II for details. To look into the system dynamics, we employ a hybrid approach that includes both a theoretical and a numerical analysis: kinetic-theory tools\u2014via a Sonine approximation of the EFPE equation\u2014for the former and direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), together with event-driven molecular dynamics (EDMD), simulations for the latter.\nNote that it is the nonlinearity of the drag force that the ME stems from. As a consequence, the time evolution of the kinetic temperature is coupled to other moments and the kinetic temperature of the nonlinear fluid shows algebraic nonexponential relaxation and strong memory effects after a quench [37]. Note also that elastic collisions do not change the average kinetic energy: Were the drag absent, the kinetic temperature would remain constant throughout the whole time evolution. Still, an initial nonequilibrium VDF would evolve\ntoward the equilibrium Maxwellian\u2014higher-order velocity cumulants would indeed be affected by collisions and tend to zero in the long-time limit.\nThe above characterizations of out-of-equilibrium temperature and distance to equilibrium, Eqs. (1) and (2), are quite natural in the molecular fluid. Yet, a different choice may be more adequate in other systems. On the one hand, some kind of nonequilibrium temperature, e.g., in the spirit of the fictive or effective temperature for glassy systems [69\u201371], may be introduced in systems where the kinetic temperature cannot be defined\u2014for example, Ising models [72]. On the other hand, the L1 and L2 norms have been employed in the literature to measure the distance of the VDF to equilibrium [51,54,64]. Alternative choices for the observables characterizing the thermal relaxation and the distance to equilibrium may quantitatively affect the values of the crossing times t\u03b8 and tD, and even the own existence of the TME and the EME.\nWith the above definitions, both the TME and the EME can be investigated. Some basic questions arise, though. Does the TME imply the EME, or vice versa? When both of them are present, how close are the respective crossover times t\u03b8 and tD? Is it possible to observe the ME if the kinetic temperature of at least one of the two samples overshoots its equilibrium value? The theoretical framework developed in this paper, which is supported by computer simulations, answers these key questions.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II puts forward our model system for a fluid with nonlinear drag. Also, the local equilibrium concept is introduced and its implications for the entropic distance are discussed. In Sec. III, we derive the evolution equations for the relevant physical quantities, within the Sonine approximation schemes developed in this paper. From this knowledge, the general phenomenology of TME and EME is predicted and described from heuristic arguments in Sec. IV. Afterwards, in Sec. V a singular case for TME, induced by the appearance of an overshoot effect, is investigated. Thus, Secs. II\u2013V constitute the core of the theoretical framework developed in the paper.

MODEL SYSTEM AND LOCAL EQUILIBRIUM\nLet us consider the following model for a fluid with nonlinear drag [36,37,73\u201375]: a d-dimensional fluid of elastic hard spheres of mass m and diameter \u03c3 , with number density n, subjected to a stochastic force composed by a white-noise term with nonlinear variance plus a nonlinear drag force. This scheme mimics a system of elastic spheres assumed to be suspended in a background fluid in equilibrium at temperature Tb, as depicted in Fig. 1.\nThe (spatially uniform) EFPE for the one-body VDF f (v, t ) reads\n\u2202t f (v, t ) \u2212 \u2202 \u2202v\n\u00b7 [ \u03b6 (v)v + \u03be 2(v)\n2\n\u2202\n\u2202v\n] f (v, t ) = J[v| f , f ],\n(3) where\nJ[v1| f , f ] = \u03c3 d\u22121gc \u222b dv2 \u222b + d \u03c3\u0302 v12 \u00b7 \u03c3\u0302\n\u00d7 [ f (v\u20321, t ) f (v\u20322, t ) \u2212 f (v1, t ) f (v2, t )] (4) is the usual Boltzmann-Enskog collision operator with v12 \u2261 v1 \u2212 v2, gc = limr\u2192\u03c3+ g(r) being the contact value of the pair correlation function and \u222b + d \u03c3\u0302 \u2261 \u222b d \u03c3\u0302 (v12 \u00b7 \u03c3\u0302 ). In addition, the drag component of the stochastic force is \u2212m\u03b6 (v)v, while the white-noise counterpart has a nonlinear variance m2\u03be 2(v). The functions \u03b6 (v) and \u03be 2(v) are connected via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem as\n\u03be 2(v) = 2kBTb m \u03b6 (v), (5)\nwhere Tb is the temperature of the background fluid. This ensures that the only stationary solution of the EFPE is the equilibrium Maxwellian,\nf eq(v) = n ( m\n2\u03c0kBTb\n)d/2 e\u2212mv 2/2kBTb . (6)\nA quadratic dependence of the drag coefficient naturally appears when the hard spheres and the background fluid particles have a comparable mass [36,37,73\u201375],\n\u03b6 (v) = \u03b60 ( 1 + \u03b3 mv 2\nkBTb\n) . (7)\nThe coefficients \u03b60 and \u03b3 are both positive and measure the zero-velocity value of the drag coefficient and the degree of nonlinearity of the drag force, respectively. Note that, due to the nonlinearity of the drag force, the implementation of the Langevin equation associated with the free streaming of particles between collisions is far from trivial. This issue is discussed in Appendix A.\nThe two approaches to the ME can be implemented in the nonlinear fluid introduced above. Translating Eqs. (1) and (2) to our model system, we have that the nonequilibrium\ntemperature T (t ) is given by\nT (t ) = m dkB \u3008v2\u3009 = m ndkB\n\u222b dv v2 f (v, t ), (8)\nand the relative entropy is D(t ) = \u2329 ln f\nf eq\n\u232a = 1\nn\n\u222b dv f (v, t ) ln\nf (v, t ) f eq(v) , (9)\nwhere n \u2261 \u222b dv f (v, t ) is the number density. On physical grounds, it is expected that the evolution of the gas toward equilibrium takes place along two stages [76]. First, a rapid \u201ckinetic\u201d stage where the VDF approaches the so-called local equilibrium (LE) form,\nf LE(v; T (t )) = n [\nm\n2\u03c0kBT (t )\n]d/2 e\u2212mv 2/2kBT (t ), (10)\ni.e., f LE has the Maxwellian shape but with the timedependent temperature. Second, a slower \u201chydrodynamic\u201d stage, where the VDF is close to f LE and the evolution of the VDF takes place via the temperature.\nThe above discussion suggests the following decomposition for the relative entropy:\nD(t ) = Dkin(t ) + DLE(T (t )), (11) where\nDkin(t ) = 1 n\n\u222b dv f (v, t ) ln\nf (v, t ) f LE(v; T (t ))\n(12a)\nand\nDLE(T (t )) = 1 n\n\u222b dv f LE(v; T (t )) ln\nf LE(v; T (t )) f eq(v)\n= d 2 [\u03b8 (t ) \u2212 1 \u2212 ln \u03b8 (t )], \u03b8 (t ) \u2261 T (t ) Tb . (12b)\nBoth Dkin and DLE are positive definite [77]. To split D into the sum of Dkin and DLE, we have employed that the average of the kinetic energy with f (v, t ) is the same as with f LE(v; T (t )). A generalization of this idea makes it possible to define a nonequilibrium temperature and an analogous splitting of D in quite a general class of systems, see Sec. VII for further details.\nThe first contribution to the total D, Dkin, is a measure of the departure of the true VDF from the LE one, and depends explicitly on time through the whole VDF f (v, t ). In contrast, the second contribution DLE measures the deviation of the LE state from the asymptotic equilibrium state and only depends on time through the nonequilibrium temperature T (t ), namely on the temperature ratio \u03b8 (t ). More specifically, DLE monotonically increases as |\u03b8 \u2212 1| increases in the domains \u03b8 > 1 and \u03b8 < 1 separately. Figure 2 presents a sketch of the temporal evolution of D and its two contributions, DLE and Dkin [78].\nThe TME and EME can be directly related if the crossing comes about in the hydrodynamic regime, since therein Dkin \u2248 0 and D(t ) \u2248 DLE(\u03b8 (t ))\u2014which is a function of temperature only, as explicitly stated by our notation. Therefore, the TME and EME become equivalent during the hydrodynamic stage, and t\u03b8 tD. However, we will show that in most situations the ME occurs during the kinetic stage, the\n054140-3\ncontribution Dkin is then relevant, and the physical picture is much more complex. In fact, the two-stage relaxation picture may even break down under certain conditions, as discussed in Ref. [79]."

(16) The parameter \u03b6 \u22170 measures the relative relevance of the drag force (i.e., the interactions between the particles and the background fluid) and hard-sphere binary collisions. The limit \u03b6 \u22170 \u2192 0 corresponds to negligible drag force, where the EFPE reduces to the Enskog equation. The limit \u03b6 \u22170 \u2192 \u221e corresponds to negligible collisions, where the EFPE reduces to the Fokker-Planck equation [80]. In this work, we typically consider the value \u03b6 \u22170 = 1, for which the drag force and binary collisions are comparable and act over the same timescale. Note that both the drag force and binary collisions drive by themselves the system to equilibrium, independently of the magnitude of the other interaction, with the entropic distance monotonically decreasing to zero [81].\nIn the remainder of the paper we employ dimensionless quantities. Dimensionless temperature is identified with the temperature ratio \u03b8 defined in Eq. (12b). For simplicity, henceforth the stars on t\u2217 and \u03b6 \u22170 are dropped. The evolution equation for the temperature, Eq. (13), thus reads\n\u03b8\u0307 \u03b60 = \u22122(\u03b8 \u2212 1)[1 + (d + 2)\u03b3 \u03b8 ] \u2212 2(d + 2)\u03b3 \u03b82a2. (17)\nNotice that one gets Newton\u2019s cooling law \u03b8\u0307 = \u22122\u03b60(\u03b8 \u2212 1) in the linear case \u03b3 = 0. However, if \u03b3 = 0, then the evolution of temperature is coupled to that of the fourth-degree moment \u3008v4\u3009 through a2. Next, the evolution equation for \u3008v4\u3009 stemming from the EFPE, Eq. (3), is coupled to the sixth-degree moment \u3008v6\u3009 due to the nonlinear drag term and to all the moments \u3008v \u3009 due to the collision term, and so on. Thus, the full evolution of \u03b8 (t ) is coupled to the infinite hierarchy of moment equations, which are derived in Appendix B by introducing a Sonine expansion of the VDF. By retaining only the first two terms in the expansion, which involve the excess kurtosis (or fourth-order cumulant) a2 and the sixth-order cumulant a3,\na3(t ) = 1 + 3a2 \u2212 d 2 (d + 2)(d + 4) \u3008v6\u3009 \u3008v2\u30093 , (18)\nand neglecting nonlinear terms in the cumulants one gets\na\u03072 \u03b60\n= \u22128\u03b3 (\u03b8 \u2212 1) + 4 [\n2\u03b3 \u2212 (d + 8)\u03b3 \u03b8 \u2212 1 \u03b8\n] a2\n+ 4(d + 4)\u03b3 \u03b8a3 \u2212 8(d \u2212 1) d (d + 2)\n\u221a \u03b8\n\u03b60\n( a2 \u2212 a3\n4\n) , (19a)\na\u03073 \u03b60\n= \u221224\u03b3 (2 \u2212 3\u03b8 )a2 + 6 [\n4\u03b3 \u2212 (d + 14)\u03b3 \u03b8 \u2212 1 \u03b8\n] a3\n+ \u221a \u03b8\n\u03b60\n3(d \u2212 1) d (d + 2)(d + 4) [4a2 \u2212 (4d + 19)a3]. (19b)\nEquations (17) and (19) make a closed set of three coupled differential equations, nonlinear in the temperature but linear in the cumulants.\nIn this paper, we consider two Sonine approximations. The roughest approximation consists of neglecting a3, setting a3 = 0 in Eq. (19a), and dealing then with Eqs. (17) and (19a) for the pair (\u03b8, a2). Here we term this approach the basic Sonine approximation (BSA) [82]. A more sophisticated theory is obtained by keeping a3 and dealing then with Eqs. (17) and (19). We term this approach the extended Sonine approximation (ESA) [83].\nIV. THERMAL VERSUS ENTROPIC MPEMBA EFFECTS\nA. Heuristic arguments\nNow we proceed to study the ME in the theoretical framework of the Sonine approximations we have just introduced. To start with, let us consider two samples (A and B) at the same initial temperatures \u03b8A(0) \u2261 \u03b80A and \u03b8B(0) \u2261 \u03b80B , above the equilibrium value, i.e., \u03b80A = \u03b80B > 1. According to Eq. (17), the initial slopes \u03b8\u0307A(0) and \u03b8\u0307B(0) satisfy the inequality \u03b8\u0307A(0) < \u03b8\u0307B(0) if a2A(0) \u2261 a02A > a2B(0) \u2261 a02B, in which case sample A is expected to reach equilibrium before sample\n054140-4\nB. It must be brought to bear that the latter statement is true if \u03b8 (t ) \u2212 1 keeps its initial sign along the whole relaxation to equilibrium, a condition that is assumed throughout this section. Exceptions to this fact, due to the overshoot of \u03b8 with respect to its equilibrium value, are discussed in Sec. V.\nIn order to analyze the TME described in Sec. I, let us take now \u03b80A > \u03b8 0 B > 1. As discussed above, \u03b8\u0307A(0) < \u03b8\u0307B(0) if a02A > a 0 2B. In that way, it can be expected that, by a convenient choice of the initial-condition values (\u03b80A, a 0 2A) and (\u03b8 0 B, a 0 2B), the evolution curves \u03b8A(t ) and \u03b8B(t ) intersect at a certain crossover time t\u03b8 . That is, \u03b8A(t\u03b8 ) = \u03b8B(t\u03b8 ) and \u03b8\u0307A(t\u03b8 ) < \u03b8\u0307B(t\u03b8 ), which entails a2A(t\u03b8 ) > a2B(t\u03b8 ) and 1 < \u03b8A(t ) < \u03b8B(t ) for t > t\u03b8 . This is the typical framework for the emergence of the (direct) TME in the kinetic description [36,37,39].\nThe inverse TME is analogous, except that, instead of \u03b80A > \u03b8 0 B > 1, one now has \u03b8 0 A < \u03b8 0 B < 1. If now a 0 2B > a 0 2A, then \u03b8\u0307B(0) < \u03b8\u0307A(0), so that it is in principle possible that the evolution curve \u03b8A(t ) intersects \u03b8B(t ) at a certain crossover time t\u03b8 .\nNote that, without loss of generality, we denote by A the sample with an initial temperature farther from the equilibrium one, both in the direct and inverse TME. Thus, the necessary (but, of course, not sufficient) conditions for the direct and inverse TME are a02A > a 0 2B and a 0 2B > a 0 2A, respectively. In this work, we analyze both the TME and the EME. In the latter, it is the evolution curves of the relative entropy D that intersect at a certain time tD, as described in Sec. I [84]. In particular, we want to understand whether the TME implies the EME or not. Also, when both the TME and the EME are present, we would like to investigate the relation between the crossing times t\u03b8 and tD.\nLet us address the questions above by simple heuristic arguments. First, we consider the case in which the further from equilibrium sample in the kinetic approach (A) is also the further from equilibrium in the entropic approach, i.e., D0A > D0B. Therein, the existence of the TME implies that of the EME, and vice versa, as shown below. Note that D0A > D0B if D0 increases with |\u03b80 \u2212 1|. This is indeed true for the LE contribution DLE, but not necessarily so for the total KLD D if the kinetic contribution Dkin plays a relevant role.\nFor the direct TME, we have \u03b80A > \u03b8 0 B > 1 and D0A > D0B. If the TME exists, then one has \u03b8B(t ) > \u03b8A(t ) > 1 after the crossover. In particular, this holds for sufficiently long times belonging to the hydrodynamic stage, where both DkinA and\nDkinB are negligible, and thus one has DB(t ) > DA(t ) (EME) in the same stage. Reciprocally, if the EME exists, then DB(t ) > DA(t ) in the hydrodynamic stage after the crossover, implying \u03b8B(t ) > \u03b8A(t ) > 1 (TME) in the same regime. An analogous reasoning applies to the inverse TME, i.e., 1 > \u03b80B > \u03b8 0 A and D0A > D0B. Provided that the TME and EME are present, the argument above does not tell us the relative positioning of the crossover times t\u03b8 and tD, i.e., whether t\u03b8 > tD or t\u03b8 < tD. Let us start by considering that the direct TME takes place at t\u03b8 . Therefore, we have that DLEA (t\u03b8 ) = DLEB (t\u03b8 ) and only the kinetic part contributes to the KLD difference at t\u03b8 , DA(t\u03b8 ) \u2212 DB(t\u03b8 ) = DkinA (t\u03b8 ) \u2212 DkinB (t\u03b8 ). This implies that DA(t\u03b8 ) < DB(t\u03b8 ) (and hence tD < t\u03b8 ) if DkinA (t\u03b8 ) < DkinB (t\u03b8 ), while DA(t\u03b8 ) > DB(t\u03b8 ) (and hence tD > t\u03b8 ) otherwise.\nFor the sake of simplicity, and to go beyond the generic analysis of the previous paragraph, let us assume that the values of the excess kurtoses at the crossover time t\u03b8 are small enough as to approximate Dkin \u221d a22. The proportionality constant may depend on the details of the VDF\u2014see Eq. (24) below for the specific example of a gamma distribution. Within this approximation, the first case, tD < t\u03b8 , is expected if |a2A(t\u03b8 )| < |a2B(t\u03b8 )|, while the second case, tD > t\u03b8 , is expected if |a2A(t\u03b8 )| > |a2B(t\u03b8 )|. Both scenarios are possible, even recalling that a2A(t\u03b8 ) > a2B(t\u03b8 ) is a necessary condition to have the TME, because the sign of the excess kurtoses of samples A and B may be different. For the case of the inverse TME, the sign of tD \u2212 t\u03b8 coincides again with that of |a2A(t\u03b8 )| \u2212 |a2B(t\u03b8 )|.\nThe different possibilities analyzed above for the case D0A > D0B are summarized in Table I, specifically as cases labeled ET1, TE1 (for the direct ME) and ET2, TE2 (for the inverse ME).\nNow we move onto the situation in which the further from equilibrium sample in the kinetic approach (A) is, however, the closer to equilibrium in the entropic approach, D0A < D0B. On account of Eq. (12b), the condition D0B > D0A requires\nDkin,0B \u2212 Dkin,0A > d\n2\n( \u03b80A \u2212 \u03b80B \u2212 ln \u03b80A\n\u03b80B\n) > 0. (20)\nAdditional cases are possible, which are labeled as T1, T2, E1, and E2 in Table I. The TME and the EME are no longer biunivocally related. For example, in the T1 case, the direct TME is present but no genuine EME takes place: \u03b80A > \u03b8 0 B > 1 and\n054140-5\n\u03b8B(t ) > \u03b8A(t ) > 1 for t > t\u03b8 , but DB > DA both initially and for asymptotically long times. Note, however, that this does not prevent the difference DB(t ) \u2212 DA(t ) from changing its sign an even number of times during the transient relaxation.\nTo fix ideas and for further use, let us take the VDF corresponding to a gamma distribution [85] for the probability density of the variable x = c2. Using the condition \u3008c2\u3009 = d 2 , the reduced VDF associated with the gamma distribution reads\n\u03c6(c) = \u03c0\u2212d/2 ( d 2 )z dz/2\n( dz2 ) cd (z\u22121)e\u2212zc 2 , z \u2261 1 1 + d+22 a2 . (21)\nNote that this includes the LE distribution, Eq. (B10), as the special case a2 = 0. Thus, the deviations of the distribution (21) from LE are monitored by the excess kurtosis a2 only. In particular, the sixth cumulant is given by\na3 = 4 d + 4a2\n( 1 \u2212 d + 2\n2 a2\n) . (22)\nThe KLD of the gamma distribution with respect to the LE one is [86]\nDkin = d 2\n{ ln z + (z \u2212 1) [ \u03c8 ( dz\n2\n) \u2212 1 ]} + ln ( d 2 )\n( dz 2 ) , (23) in which \u03c8 (x) = d ln (x)/dx is the digamma function [87]. For small |a2|, one has\nDkin \u2248 d (d + 2) 2\n16\n[ d\n2 \u03c8 \u2032\n( d\n2\n) \u2212 1 ] a22, (24)\nwhere \u03c8 \u2032(x) \u2261 d\u03c8 (x)/dx. The dependence of Dkin, as given by Eq. (23), as a function of a2 in the three-dimensional case (d = 3) is shown in Fig. 3. We observe that Dkin grows more rapidly for negative than for positive values of a2, exhibiting a vertical asymptote at a2 = \u22122/(d + 2), which corresponds to z \u2192 \u221e.\nB. Linearized analysis\nTo provide a simple, but yet more quantitative, study, in the remainder of this section (and also in Sec. V) we adopt the linearization scheme put forward in Ref. [36]. The starting point is the BSA described by Eqs. (17) and (19a), setting a3 \u2192 0 in the latter. Furthermore, the temperature ratio \u03b8 is linearized around a reference value \u03b8r close to \u03b80 \u2261 \u03b8 (0). The solution of the resulting set of two differential equations is [36]\n\u03b8 (t ) = B1 + [ A11(\u03b8 0 \u2212 B1) \u2212 A12 ( a02 \u2212 B2 )] e\u2212\u03bb\u2212t\n\u2212[(A11 \u2212 1)(\u03b80 \u2212 B1) \u2212 A12(a02 \u2212 B2)]e\u2212\u03bb+t , (25a)\na2(t ) = B2 + [ A22 ( a02 \u2212 B2 ) \u2212 A21(\u03b80 \u2212 B1)]e\u2212\u03bb\u2212t \u2212 [(A22 \u2212 1)(a02 \u2212 B2) \u2212 A21(\u03b80 \u2212 B1)]e\u2212\u03bb+t ,\n(25b)\nin which a02 \u2261 a2(0), and the expressions of the parameters \u03bb\u00b1, Bi, and Ai j can be found in Appendix C. We refer to Eqs. (25) as the linearized basic Sonine approximation (LBSA). When using the LBSA to investigate the ME, we are assuming that \u03b8 (t ) is close to \u03b8r , which in turn is close to \u03b80. This entails that the LBSA is expected to be applicable to the kinetic stage only\u2014i.e., when the ME comes about for short times.\nThe LBSA can be applied to the evolution of the two samples A and B with the convenient choice \u03b8r = \u03b80B [36]. It is then straightforward to find the crossover time t\u03b8 as\nt\u03b8 = 1 \u03bb+ \u2212 \u03bb\u2212 ln\n( 1 + A \u22121 11\nR0max/R 0 \u2212 1\n) , (26)\nwhere\nR0 \u2261 \u03b8 0 A \u2212 \u03b80B\na02A \u2212 a02B , R0max \u2261 A12 A11 . (27)\nTherefore, in the LBSA, the crossover time t\u03b8 depends on the set of four initial values \u03b80A , a 0 2A, \u03b8 0 B , and a 0 2B only through the ratio R0. Moreover, Eq. (26) is meaningful only if\n0 < R0 < R0max. (28)\nOtherwise, no TME\u2014either direct or inverse\u2014exists. The determination of the crossover time tD is much more involved, even in the simple LBSA. It is obtained as the solution of a transcendental equation and the solution depends on \u03b80A , a 0 2A, \u03b8 0 B , and a 0 2B. The locus separating the region where tD < t\u03b8 from the region where tD > t\u03b8 is approximately given by the condition |a2A(t\u03b8 )| = |a2B(t\u03b8 )|; the sign of tD \u2212 t\u03b8 is the same as that of |a2A(t\u03b8 )| \u2212 |a2B(t\u03b8 )|\u2014as discussed in the previous section. See cases ET1, TE1, ET2, and TE2 in Table I. Furthermore, cases T1, T2, E1, and E2 are possible if the initial values of the KLD cross the locus D0A = D0B, as summarized in Table I and described in Sec. IV A. If the locus D0A = D0B happens to separate regions ET1 and T1 (or ET2 and T2), then one has tD \u2192 0 on the locus, so that 0 < tD < t\u03b8 in region ET1 (or ET2) and formally tD < 0 < t\u03b8 in region T1 (or T2).\n054140-6"

            "text": "Let us choose the four representative pairs (a02A, a 0 2B) presented in Table II. Since the scenarios ET1 and TE1 described in Table I require a02A > a 0 2B, they are in principle feasible for the pairs I and II. Analogously, the scenarios ET2 and TE2 might be possible for the pairs III and IV. Next, by assuming the initial VDF has the gamma form, Eq. (21), we have Dkin,0B > D kin,0 A for the pairs I and IV, but not for the pairs II and III; in view of Eq. (20), we conclude that, in principle, cases T1, E1, and E2 are possible for pair I and cases T2, E1, and E2 for pair IV.\nThe phase diagrams predicted by the LBSA are shown in Fig. 4 for \u03b60 = 1, \u03b3 = 0.1, and d = 3. We observe that, at least for that choice of the parameters, case TE1 is absent for the class of initial conditions I, while cases ET2 and TE2 are absent for the class of initial conditions IV. This confirms that the initial conditions shown in the third column of Table I for the cases ET1, TE1, ET2, and TE2 represent necessary\u2014 but not sufficient\u2014conditions for their occurrence, the actual realization of those scenarios depending on the evolution of a2A(t ) and a2B(t ).\nThe time evolution of the differences\nD \u2261 DA \u2212 DB, DLE \u2261 DLEA \u2212 DLEB , (29) for the representative points indicated in Fig. 4 are displayed in Figs. 5\u20138, where the difference Dkin = DkinA \u2212 DkinB = D \u2212 DLE is also included. The change of sign of DLEA \u2212 DLEB and DA \u2212 DB during their evolution signals the presence of the TME and EME, respectively. Here, we made an extra ansatz to evaluate Dkin(t ). As we are working with an initial gamma distribution and the final equilibrium state is a particular case of such a distribution\u2014with a2 = 0, we have assumed that the VDF during its time evolution is sufficiently close to a gamma distribution so as to estimate Dkin(t ) by Eq. (23) with an excess kurtosis a2(t ) given by Eq. (25b).\nFigures 5(b) and 5(c) are both examples of the scenario T1 for the class of initial conditions I. In Fig. 5(b), where (\u03b80B \u2212 1, \u03b80A \u2212 \u03b80B ) = (0.8, 0.2) [see Fig. 4(a)], the difference D0A \u2212 D0B presents a negative local maximum. When moving horizontally in Fig. 4(a) to the point (\u03b80B \u2212 1, \u03b80A \u2212 \u03b80B ) = (0.3, 0.2), however, Fig. 5(c) shows that the local maximum of D0A \u2212 D0B becomes positive and D0A \u2212 D0B vanishes twice during the time evolution. While interesting, this does not qualify as an EME because, as already said above Eq. (20), DB > DA both initially and for asymptotically long times. Next, moving vertically in Fig. 4(a) to the point (\u03b80B \u2212 1, \u03b80A \u2212 \u03b80B ) = (0.3, 0.5), the local maximum observed in Fig. 5(d) is again positive but there is a single crossing D0A \u2212 D0B = 0, which results in the E1 scenario.\nV. OVERSHOOT MPEMBA EFFECT\nIn Sec. IV, we have assumed that, even though the evolution of \u03b8 (t ) may not be monotonic, \u03b8 (t ) \u2212 1 does not change sign, i.e., the temperature does not overshoot the equilibrium\n054140-7\nvalue. However, such an overshoot \u03b8 (tO) = 1 at a finite time tO is possible. In general, a2(tO) = 0, and Eq. (17) shows that \u03b8\u0307 (tO)/\u03b60\u03b3 = \u22122(d + 2)a2(tO) = 0. As a consequence, starting from \u03b80 > 1, \u03b8 (t ) \u2212 1 develops a hump with a negative minimum if a2(tO) > 0; analogously, starting from \u03b80 < 1 and if a2(tO) < 0, \u03b8 (t ) \u2212 1 develops a hump with a positive maximum, reminiscent of the Kovacs effect [37,88\u201394]. We will refer to this crossover \u03b8 (tO) = 1 and subsequent hump, either positive or negative, as an overshoot phenomenon.\nGiven the fact that the relaxation of a2(t ) is generally much faster than that of \u03b8 (t ), at least if \u03b80 = O(1) [37], it is reasonable to expect that the overshoot effect requires initial values |\u03b80 \u2212 1| 1, unless |a02| is unphysically large. This suggests a theoretical treatment based on the LBSA (25) with \u03b8r \u2192 1, i.e.,\n\u03b8 (t ) = 1 + [A\u030411(\u03b80 \u2212 1) \u2212 A\u030412a02]e\u2212\u03bb\u0304\u2212t \u2212 [(A\u030411 \u2212 1)(\u03b80 \u2212 1) \u2212 A\u030412a02]e\u2212\u03bb\u0304+t , (30a)\na2(t ) = [ A\u030422a 0 2 \u2212 A\u030421(\u03b80 \u2212 1) ] e\u2212\u03bb\u0304\u2212t\n\u2212[(A\u030422 \u2212 1)a02 \u2212 A\u030421(\u03b80 \u2212 1)]e\u2212\u03bb\u0304+t , (30b) where overlined quantities refer to their values at \u03b8r = 1. Following the same methodology as in Eqs. (26) and (27),\n054140-8\nwe find\ntO = 1 \u03bb\u0304+ \u2212 \u03bb\u0304\u2212 ln\n[ 1 + A\u0304 \u22121 11\nR\u03040maxa 0 2/(\u03b8\n0 \u2212 1) \u2212 1 ] , (31)\nwhere\nR\u03040max \u2261 A\u030412 A\u030411 . (32)\nTherefore, according to the LBSA, the overshoot effect appears if\n0 < \u03b80 \u2212 1\na02 < R\u03040max. (33)\nIt is interesting to look into the possible change of the ME phenomenology brought about by the overshoot-induced humps. As we show below, the existence of humps may make it necessary to change the preconception of considering the TME present only when the evolution curves of the temperature of the two samples intersect. To be more specific, we consider, as before, samples A and B with A being the initially hotter, i.e., \u03b80A > \u03b8 0 B > 1. Let us assume that the colder sample B fulfills condition (33) but the hotter sample does not. In that case, \u03b8B(t ) might not be crossed by the curve \u03b8A(t ), which remains always above the equilibrium temperature, and yet relax more slowly to equilibrium than A but from below.\nWe could then say that a (direct) TME is present without the existence of a standard crossover time t\u03b8 , provided that a crossover between the LE KLD curves DLEA (t ) and DLEB (t ) occurs at a certain time tDLE . A completely analogous situation is possible for the inverse ME, i.e., when \u03b80A < \u03b8 0 B < 1. We will refer to this phenomenon, where DLEA and DLEB intersect but \u03b8A(t ) and \u03b8B(t ) do not, as the overshoot ME (OME). This phenomenon is reminiscent of the ME observed in Ref. [21] in supercooled water.\nThe different scenarios where overshoot-induced humps appear are illustrated in Fig. 9 for direct preparations, i.e., \u03b80A > \u03b8 0 B > 1. In Fig. 9(a), \u03b8A(t ) and \u03b8B(t ) do not cross each other, but they both exhibit humps, the one in system B being stronger than in system A. This makes the latter system relax to equilibrium earlier than the former, which physically qualifies as a direct TME. While in the thermal scheme there\n054140-9\nis no crossing, the positiveness of DLE forces an intersection between A and B curves, as observed in Fig. 9(b). This is the essence of the OME.\nOn the other hand, the existence of humps or of a finite crossover time t\u03b8 does not ensure the existence of TME. In fact, in Fig. 9(c) there is a crossing between the thermal curves, but the overshoot-induced humps make the initially hotter system relax later to the equilibrium state, thus frustrating the TME. This is signaled by a pair of intersections in the DLE curves of Fig. 9(d), so the OME is absent. The third different scenario is reflected in Figs. 9(e) and 9(f), where there is no crossover either in the thermal evolution or in DLE, even though sample B exhibits a thermal hump.\nThe analogous cases for inverse preparations \u03b80A < \u03b8 0 B < 1 are illustrated in Fig. 10. To summarize, the OME is characterized by a single crossing DLEA = DLEB at a certain time tDLE , without any crossing between \u03b8A and \u03b8B. In order to establish the conditions under which this may happen, let us assume again |\u03b8 \u2212 1| 1 and approximate ln \u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8 \u2212 1 \u2212 12 (\u03b8 \u2212 1)2 in Eq. (12b). Therefore, the condition DLEA (tDLE ) = DLEB (tDLE ) with \u03b8A(tDLE ) = \u03b8B(tDLE ) translates into\n\u03b8A(tDLE ) \u2212 1 = 1 \u2212 \u03b8B(tDLE ). (34)\nMaking use of Eq. (30a) entails\ntDLE = 1\n\u03bb\u0304+ \u2212 \u03bb\u0304\u2212 ln\n( 1 + A\u0304 \u22121 11\nR\u03040max/R 0+ \u2212 1\n) , (35)\nwhere R\u03040max is defined in Eq. (32) and\nR0+ \u2261 \u03b80A + \u03b80B \u2212 2 a02A + a02B . (36)\nNote the difference between this parameter R0+ and the parameter R0 defined before in Eq. (27). Since tDLE must be finite in the OME, the corresponding condition on the initial preparation is\n0 < R0+ < R\u0304 0 max, (37a)\nR0 < 0 or R0 > R\u03040max. (37b)\nThe supplementary condition (37b) represents the violation of Eq. (28) (with \u03b8r \u2192 1) and is needed to exclude any thermal crossing.\nAccording to Eq. (33), if both systems A and B exhibit overshoot-induced humps, the condition given by Eq. (37a) is ensured. As a test, note that R0max = 0.172 for all the cases considered in Figs. 9 and 10. The values of (R0+, R\n0) are (0.060,\u221e), (0.086,0.133), and (1,\u22120.059) in the cases represented in Figs. 9(a) and 9(b), Figs. 9(c) and 9(d), and Figs. 9(e)\n054140-10\nand 9(f), respectively. Analogously, (R0+, R 0) are (0.071,\u221e), (0.111,0.120), and (2,\u22120.123) in the cases represented in Figs. 10(a) and 10(b), Figs. 10(c) and 10(d), and Figs. 10(e) and 10(f), respectively. Thus, the OME double condition (37) is fulfilled only in the cases (a) and (b) of Figs. 9 and 10.\nVI. SIMULATION RESULTS\nIn this section, our simulation results are used to test the theoretical predictions stemming from the numerical solutions of (i) the (nonlinear) BSA, Eqs. (17) and (19a) with a3 \u2192 0, and ESA, Eqs. (17) and (19). The theoretical results for the KLD D(t ) and DLE(t ) are constructed by introducing the theoretical \u03b8 (t ) and a2(t ) in Eqs. (12b) and (23), respectively.\nThe employed computer simulation schemes, DSMC and EDMD, to build the simulation curves are presented in Appendix D. In all cases, the (reduced) initial VDF has been taken as the gamma distribution given by Eq. (21) with the chosen value of the initial excess kurtosis a02, as previously done in Refs. [39,95,96]. The KLD from simulations is computed as described in Refs. [95,96].\nFigures 11 and 12 contain the theoretical and simulation results of the time evolution of the temperature ratio \u03b8 and the KLD D. The graphs for the cumulants a2 and a3 are presented in Appendix E. Samples A and B are prepared with the representative values of the cumulants in Table II, namely pairs I and II (III and IV) for the direct (inverse) ME, and different values of the initial temperatures \u03b80A and \u03b8 0 B . Pairs (\u03b80A, \u03b8 0 B ) are chosen to illustrate the different cases summarized in Table I. Specifically, we present the cases ET1 in Figs. 11(a) and 11(b), TE1 in Figs. 11(c) and 11(d), ET2 in Figs. 11(e) and 11(f), TE2 in Figs. 11(g) and 11(h), T1 in Figs. 12(a) and 12(b), T1 with a double crossing in D in Figs. 12(c) and 12(d), E1 in Figs. 12(e) and 12(f), T2 in Figs. 12(g) and 12(h), and E2 in Figs. 12(i) and 12(j). Note that the cases in Figs. 11(a) and 11(b), 11(c) and 11(d), 11(e) and 11(f), 12(a) and 12(b), 12(g) and 12(h), and 12(i) and 12(j) are the same as in Figs. 5(a), 6(b), 7(b), 5(b), 8(b), and 8(c), respectively. Moreover, the case in Figs. 12(c) and 12(d) is close to the case in Fig. 5(c).\nIt must be remarked that the classification of the case in Figs. 11(e) and 11(f) as ET2 is less clear than expected. The LBSA theory predicts the ET2 behavior with a wide difference between t\u03b8 and tD, as observed in the inset of Fig. 7(b). Still, nonlinearities reduce the time difference t\u03b8 \u2212 tD. Moreover, the double crossing in D predicted by the LBSA for the case of Figs. 12(c) and 12(d) is not actually observed in the simulations. The shallow positive maximum of DA \u2212 DB predicted by the LBSA, as seen in Fig. 5(c), is washed out by nonlinear contributions\u2014at least in the case represented in Figs. 12(c) and 12(d).\nLet us now turn to the OME predicted by the LBSA, which we have discussed in Sec. V. Figures 13 and 14 show the time evolution of \u03b8 , DLE, and D for the same cases as considered in Figs. 9 and 10, respectively. Again, the graphs for a2 and a3 can be found in Appendix E. We see that the overshoot behavior and the OME phenomenology are indeed present. The crossover characterizing the TME is accounted for by the intersection of the DLE curves in Figs. 13(a)\u201313(c) and 14(a)\u201314(c), though the corresponding temperature curves never cross.\nThe figures in this section show that our theoretical predictions for both \u03b8 (t ) and D(t ) are generally in very good agreement with DSMC and EDMD simulation results. This is especially true for the ESA, which still gives a good account of the behavior of the fourth cumulant a2(t ) and a fair account of the behavior of the sixth cumulant a3(t ) (see Figs. 17\u201320), consistently with the results reported in Ref. [37]. The improvement of the ESA over the BSA can be understood by noticing that the values of the cumulant a3 are typically of the same magnitude as those of a2. It is also worth highlighting the generally good agreement between the simulation results for the relative entropy D and those obtained from Eqs. (12b)\n054140-11\nand (23) when \u03b8 and a2 are given by either the BSA or the ESA. This means that the gamma distribution in Eq. (21) represents a convenient proxy of the unknown time-dependent VDF. This ansatz is further confirmed by the generally fair agreement (not shown) between the simulation data for a3 and\nthe right-hand side of Eq. (22) when plugging the simulation data of a2, especially in the cases with a2 < 0.\nFinally, we note that small deviations between EDMD and DSMC simulation are observed (especially for the subtler quantities D and a3), despite the low density of the systems. This might be a consequence of the approximations carried out in the numerical implementation of the Langevin dynamics in the approximate Green function (AGF) algorithm explained in Appendix D 2. Nevertheless, there is a good agreement for the collisional scheme, as tested in Appendix D 3.\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, we have analyzed in depth the relaxation to equilibrium of a dilute gas of elastic hard spheres subjected to a nonlinear drag and the associated stochastic force. We have particularly focused on two versions of the ME, namely, the TME and the EME. Our analysis combines theory and simulation. The theoretical approach is based on a Sonine expansion of the solution of the EFPE, Eq. (3). The simulation approach comprises both DSMC results, which integrate numerically Eq. (3), and EDMD results.\nWe have employed the Kullback-Leibler divergence (or relative entropy) D, defined in Eq. (9), to measure the distance to equilibrium and monitor the possible emergence of the EME. It must be remarked that other distances to equilibrium have been employed in the literature, as long as they share some common properties of monotonicity, convexity, etc. However, the choice of the distance function does not impinge on the existence of the EME\u2014for a thorough discussion of this issue, see Ref. [51]. The KLD choice for the distance function is quite natural due, to its connection to the nonequilibrium entropy, and especially convenient for comparing the TME and EME, since D can be decomposed into two summands, see Eqs. (11) and (12). First, the hydrodynamic LE contribution DLE, which only depends on the temperature and, second, the kinetic-stage correction Dkin, which depends on the whole VDF. To obtain an approximate expression for the latter within the Sonine approximation, we have employed the gamma distribution function, Eq. (23).\nFor given values of the drag force, i.e., given values of (\u03b60, \u03b3 ), the emergence of ME\u2014either direct or inverse\u2014 depends on the initial preparations of the two samples (A, whose initial temperature is farther from equilibrium, and B, whose initial temperature is closer to equilibrium). The simplest approach, based on heuristic arguments, is the LBSA given by Eqs. (25). Therein, both the temperature ratio \u03b8 (t ) and the excess kurtosis a2(t ) are a linear superposition of two exponentials.\nWhen the difference \u03b8 \u2212 1 keeps its initial sign during the relaxation process\u2014i.e., when the temperature does not cross its equilibrium value at a finite time, we have the most usual, standard situation. Bringing to bear that the kinetic-stage contribution Dkin is expected to decay to zero over a shorter timescale than that of the local equilibrium contribution DLE, we have argued that the existence of TME implies that of EME (and vice versa) if D0A > D0B. There are two possibilities: either the thermal crossover occurs earlier than the entropic one (scenarios TE1 and TE2 for direct and inverse effects,\n054140-12\nrespectively) or it occurs later than the entropic crossover (scenarios ET1 and ET2 for direct and inverse effects, respectively).\nInterestingly, even though \u03b80A departs from the equilibrium value 1 more than \u03b80B , one may have D0A < D0B due to the kinetic contribution Dkin to the entropic distance. This gives rise to the existence of TME without entropy crossover (scenarios T1 and T2 for direct and inverse effects, respectively) or, reciprocally, the existence of EME without thermal crossover (scenarios E1 and E2 for direct and inverse effects, respectively).\nA summary of all the possible scenarios above (assuming a constant sign of \u03b8 \u2212 1) is provided by Table I. The corresponding phase diagrams in the plane \u03b80A \u2212 \u03b80B vs \u03b80B \u2212 1 are depicted in Fig. 4 for a few representative choices of the initial\nexcess kurtoses a02A and a 0 2B, given in Table II. Those scenarios are modified when the condition of constant sign of \u03b8 (t ) \u2212 1 is violated, as explained below.\nNonmonotonic evolutions of \u03b8 with a crossing of the equilibrium line \u03b8 = 1 induce the appearance of overshootinduced humps. Sample B may relax to equilibrium later than sample A when the temperature of the former overshoots the equilibrium value, a fact that sample A can take advantage of. Even though \u03b8A(t ) and \u03b8B(t ) do not intersect, the corresponding curves of DLE do intersect. We have termed this class of ME as OME. Simple conditions for its existence, Eqs. (37), have been derived by adapting the LBSA to this situation.\nThe different scenarios for the ME outlined above for the nonlinear fluid, emerging in the extremely simplistic LBSA, have been tested and confirmed by computer simulations (both\n054140-13\nDSMC and EDMD). These numerical results have also been compared with the more complex nonlinear BSA and ESA. The inclusion of the additional cumulant a3 in the set of coupled evolution equations allows the ESA to improve over the BSA. Moreover, DSMC and EDMD results are practically indistinguishable, with small discrepancies that can be traced back to the approximations in the EDMD scheme during the free streaming stage, see Appendix D 2. On the other hand, the collisional schemes are tested in Appendix D 3, with good results.\nThe ME effect is brought about by the nonlinearity in the drag force, which makes the time evolution of the kinetic temperature be coupled to that of higher cumulants\u2014specifically, to that of the excess kurtosis a2 for the quadratic dependence of the drag coefficient in Eq. (7). The nonlinear drag force is also responsible for the algebraic nonexponential relaxation after a temperature quench and for the emer-\ngence of Kovacs-like response [37]. It is important to remark that these behaviors, and also the ME, survive in the limit \u03b6 \u22170 \u2192 \u221e, in which the EFPE reduces to the Fokker-Planck equation\u2014which, interestingly, successfully models mixtures of ultracold atoms [75].\nThe nonmonotonic relaxation of the kinetic temperature observed in the OME entails the necessity of revising the conventional definition of TME. Provided that both initial temperatures are either above (direct case) or below (inverse case) equilibrium, the TME is not necessarily characterized by the crossover of the nonequilibrium temperature but by the crossover of the associated positive-definite quantity DLE. Within this generalized scheme and for a general complex system, we propose the following, more dependable, definition of the TME based on the idea of local equilibrium: The TME exists in a pair of different initially prepared setups if there are an odd number of crossings between their LE relative entropy\n054140-14\nDLE curves. On another note, the definition of the EME is not affected, due to the monotonic decay of the whole relative entropy D to equilibrium. The EME exists in a pair of samples if their relaxation curves for D present an odd number of crossings.\nIt is relevant to stress that the splitting of D into \u201ckinetic\u201d and \u201clocal-equilibrium\u201d contributions can be done on quite a general basis, not only for the molecular fluid we are analyzing in this paper. Moreover, this allows for defining a nonequilibrium temperature T (t ), even in systems for which the kinetic temperature makes no sense. Let us consider a general system with Hamiltonian H (x), in which D(t ) is given by Eq. (2). The system is initially prepared in a certain state with average energy \u3008H\u30090 and is put in contact with a thermal bath at temperature Tb. Thus the probability distribution function P(x, t ) relaxes toward the equilibrium distribution Peq(x) = exp[\u2212H (x)/kBTb]/Z (Tb), where Z (Tb) is the partition function. One can always introduce a LE distribution with the canonical form PLE(x, T (t )) \u2261 exp[\u2212H (x)/kBT (t )]/Z (T (t )), with T (t ) being determined self-consistently by the condition\n\u3008H\u3009(t ) = \u222b dx H (x)P(x, t ) = \u222b dx H (x)PLE(x, T (t )). (38)\nIn this way, T (t ) corresponds to the temperature that a system would have at equilibrium if it had an average energy equal to the instantaneous value \u3008H\u3009(t ). With such a definition of the nonequilibrium temperature T (t ), is it easily shown that\nD(t ) = Dkin(t ) + DLE(T (t )), (39) where Dkin and DLE are given by\nDkin(t ) = \u222b dx P(x, t ) ln P(x, t )\nPLE(x, T (t )) , (40a)\nDLE(T (t )) = \u222b dx PLE(x, T (t )) ln PLE(x, T (t ))\nPeq(x) . (40b)\nNote that T (t ) may in general overshoot its equilibrium value Tb, leading to an OME, but DLE is positive definite and makes it possible to introduce the more reliable definition of the TME explained in the previous paragraph [97].\nWe expect this work can motivate the experimental investigation, making use of a suitable aging protocol to prepare the initial samples, of the whole variety of ME phenomenology described in this work. Specifically, our predicting and observing the OME\u2014as a novel unexpected behavior\u2014in this molecular gas driven by a nonlinear drag opens the door to its finding in other complex systems. Also, we plan to employ the theoretical and computational framework developed here to study the relaxation times of pairs of temperature quenches thermodynamically equidistant from equilibrium [98,99], one above and the other one below."

We are grateful to the computing facilities of the Instituto de Computaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica Avanzada of the University of Extremadura (ICCAEx), where our simulations were run.\nAPPENDIX A: LANGEVIN EQUATION UNDER NONLINEAR DRAG\nIn this Appendix, we discuss the Langevin equation associated with the left-hand side of Eq. (3), since the effect of interparticle collisions represented by the right-hand side is well known.\nLet us start writing the Langevin equation as\nv\u0307(t ) = \u2212\u03b6 (v(t ))vi(t ) + \u03be (v(t ))\u03b7(t ), (A1) where \u03b7(t ) is a Gaussian white-noise stochastic term with the statistical properties\n\u3008\u03b7(t )\u3009noise = 0, \u3008\u03b7(t )\u03b7(t \u2032)\u3009noise = I\u03b4(t \u2212 t \u2032), (A2) where I is the d\u00d7d unit tensor and \u3008\u00b7\u3009noise reads for an average over different realizations. Let us define a Wiener process W (t ) with elemental increment dW (t ) = \u03be (v(t ))\u03b7(t )dt . This is the case of a multiplicative noise and, therefore, there is no a unique way of interpreting the proper time within a given interval [t, t + h] at which the process W (t ) must be evaluated [101]. In general, one can choose a time t + h parameterized by 0 1. Hence, the associated FokkerPlanck equation is [101]\n\u2202t f (v) \u2212 \u2202 \u2202v\n\u00b7 [ \u03b6 (v)v + \u03be 2 (v)\n2\n\u2202\n\u2202v \u03be 2(1\u2212 )(v)\n] f (v) = 0. (A3)\nThe specific choices = 0, 12 , and 1 correspond to the It\u00f4 [67], Stratonovich [67], and Klimontovich [102] interpretations, respectively.\nThe (differential) fluctuation-dissipation relation stemming from Eq. (A3) turns out to be\n\u03b6 (v) = m\u03be 2(v) 2kBTb \u2212 1 \u2212 2v \u2202\u03be 2(v) \u2202v . (A4)\nOnly in the Klimontovich interpretation ( = 1) does one recover the conventional fluctuation-dissipation relation, Eq. (5), holding for constant drag coefficient and additive noise. In that case, the left-hand sides of Eqs. (3) and (A3) coincide.\nOn the other hand, from a simulation point of view, the It\u00f4 interpretation ( = 0) is the simplest one to implement. Fortunately, even if = 0 (as happens in the Stratonovich and Klimontovich interpretations), one can always apply the It\u00f4 interpretation to the Langevin equation, provided that the original drag coefficient \u03b6 (v) is replaced by an effective one \u03b6eff (\u201cspurious drift\u201d). Note first the mathematical identity\n\u03be 2 (v) \u2202 \u2202v \u03be 2(1\u2212 )(v) f (v) = \u2202 \u2202v \u03be 2(v) f (v) \u2212 \u2202\u03be\n2(v)\n\u2202v f (v).\n(A5)\n054140-15\nInserting this into Eq. (A3), one gets\n\u2202t f (v) \u2212 \u2202 \u2202v\n\u00b7 [ \u03b6eff (v)v + \u2202\n\u2202v \u03be 2(v) 2\n] f (v) = 0, (A6)\nwhere\n\u03b6eff (v) \u2261 \u03b6 (v) \u2212 2v\n\u2202\u03be 2(v)\n\u2202v\n= m\u03be 2(v) 2kBTb \u2212 1 2v \u2202\u03be 2(v) \u2202v . (A7)\nIn the particular case of Eq. (7) and = 1, the effective drag coefficient becomes\n\u03b6eff (v) = \u03b6 (v) \u2212 2\u03b60\u03b3 . (A8) Thus, the original Langevin equation, Eq. (A1), in the Klimontovich interpretation is equivalent to the Langevin equation\nv\u0307(t ) = \u2212\u03b6eff (v(t ))v(t ) + \u03be (v(t ))\u03b7(t ) (A9) in the It\u00f4 interpretation."

            "text": "To write the hierarchy of moment equations, it is convenient to introduce dimensionless quantities [36]. First, we define a rescaled velocity c as\nc \u2261 v vth(t )\n, vth(t ) \u2261 \u221a 2kBT (t )\nm , (B1)\nin which vth(t ) is the thermal velocity at time t . Analogously, the dimensionless VDF is introduced as\n\u03c6(c, t ) \u2261 v d th(t )\nn f (v, t ). (B2)\nIn terms of these reduced quantities, the EFPE, Eq. (3), can be rewritten as\n\u2202t\u03c6(c, t ) = 1 2\u03b8 \u2202c \u00b7 [\u03b8\u0307c + \u03b60(1 + \u03b3 \u03b8c2)(2\u03b8c + \u2202c )]\u03c6(c, t )\n+ Kd \u221a\n\u03b8 I[c|\u03c6, \u03c6], (B3) where \u03b8 is the temperature ratio\u2014as defined in Eq.

In Eq. (B3), and consistently with the main text, dimensionless variables are used\u2014recall that the stars on the dimensionless time t\u2217 and the zero-velocity drag coefficient \u03b6 \u22170 are dropped.\nMultiplying both sides of Eq. (B3) by c and defining the reduced moments\nM (t ) \u2261 \u3008c \u3009 = \u222b dc c \u03c6(c, t ), (B5)\none obtains the hierarchy of equations [36]\nM\u0307 \u03b60\n= {[\n( \u2212 2)\u03b3 + (d + 2)\u03b3 \u03b8 (1 + a2) \u2212 1 \u03b8\n] M\n\u2212 2\u03b3 \u03b8M +2 + d + \u2212 2 2 M \u22122 \u03b8\n} \u2212 Kd\n\u03b60\n\u221a \u03b8\u03bc , (B6)\nwhere we have introduced the collisional moments \u03bc as \u03bc \u2261 \u2212 \u222b dc c I[c|\u03c6, \u03c6]. (B7)\nNote that M0 = 1, M2 = d2 , and M4 = d (d+2)4 (1 + a2) [see Eq. (14)]. Conservation of mass and energy imply that \u03bc0 = \u03bc2 = 0, so that Eq. (B6) is obviously consistent with M\u03070 = M\u03072 = 0.\nMaking use of the explicit form of the collision operator, it is possible to express the collisional moments as two-particle averages of the form\n\u03bc = \u222b\ndc1 \u222b dc2 \u03c6(c1)\u03c6(c2) (c1, c2). (B8)\nIn particular, 2 = 0 and, after some algebra, one gets\n4(c1, c2) = 2\u03c0 d\u22121 2 (\nd+5 2 )c12[d (C \u00b7 c12)2 \u2212 c212C2], (ABa) 6(c1, c2) = 3 4(c1, c2) ( C2 + c 2 12\n4\n) , (B9b)\nwhere C \u2261 12 (c1 + c2) is the center-of-mass reduced velocity.\nSonine approximation\nLet us first consider the case of linear drag force, i.e., \u03b3 = 0. In that case, the LE state defined in Eq. (10) is an exact solution of the EFPE, Eq. (3). Equivalently, in reduced variables,\n\u03c6LE(c) = \u03c0\u2212d/2e\u2212c2 \u21d2 MLE2k = [d + 2(k \u2212 1)]!!\n2k , (B10)\nbecomes an exact stationary solution to Eqs. (B3) and (B6), because of the properties I[c|\u03c6LE, \u03c6LE] = 0, \u03bcLE = 0. Moreover, the solution to Eq. (17) is simply \u03b8 (t ) = 1 + [\u03b8 (0) \u2212 1]e\u22122\u03b60t , as stated in the main text. Thus, if \u03b3 = 0 and the system is initially prepared in an equilibrium state with a temperature T (0), its coupling to a bath at temperature Tb makes the temperature evolve toward Tb but otherwise the system remains always in local equilibrium, i.e., the VDF is Maxwellian with the time-dependent temperature.\nGoing back to the nonlinear case \u03b3 = 0, the VDF can be represented by the Sonine expansion\n\u03c6(c; t ) = \u03c6LE(c) [\n1 + \u221e\u2211 j=2 a j (t )L ( d\u221222 ) j (c 2)\n] , (B11)\nwhere L ( d\u221222 ) j (c 2) are generalized Laguerre (or Sonine) polynomials and the coefficients a j = [ j! ( d2 )/ ( j + d 2 )]\u3008L ( d\u221222 ) j (c 2)\u3009 are the cumulants of the nonequilibrium\n054140-16\nVDF. The associated velocity moments are M2k = MLE2k [ 1 + k\u2211\nj=2 (\u22121) j\n( k\nj\n) a j ] , k 2. (B12)\nIn particular,\nM6 = d (d + 2)(d + 4) 8 (1 + 3a2 \u2212 a3), (B13a) M8 = d (d + 2)(d + 4)(d + 6) 16\n(1 + 6a2 \u2212 4a3 + a4). (B13b)\nThe infinite moment hierarchy, Eq. (B6), cannot be solved in an exact way in general. This is even the case for linear drag, \u03b3 = 0, when the initial state is not a Maxwellian. As a consequence, the exact evolution of the temperature ratio \u03b8 (t ) cannot be obtained from Eq. (17) if \u03b3 = 0.\nLet us suppose, however, that the initial condition and subsequent evolution are sufficiently close to the LE state as to assume both the cumulants in Eq. (B11) beyond a3 and the quadratic terms in a2, a3 (i.e., those proportional to a22, a 2 3, and a2a3) being negligible. In that case, the two first nontrivial collisional moments become [100]\n\u03bc4 \u2248 2(d \u2212 1) Kd\n( a2 \u2212 a3\n4\n) , (B14a)\n\u03bc6 \u2248 3(d \u2212 1)(2d + 9) 2Kd\n( a2 \u2212 3a3\n4\n) . (B14b)\nWithin this scheme, Eq. (B6) with = 4 and = 6 yields Eq. (19) in the main text.\nAPPENDIX C: PARAMETERS IN EQS.

In both schemes, the nonlinear drag is implemented at the level of stochastic equations of motion by using Eq. (A9) and applying the associated Wiener process at time t within the interval [t, t + h].\n1. Direct simulation Monte Carlo\nThe implementation of DSMC for this system is based on the pioneering work by Bird [103,104], except for our taking into account of both the nonlinear drag and white-noise forces during the free-streaming stage of the algorithm [105].\nLet us assume a homogeneous system of N particles, where their dynamics is just controlled by their velocities {vi} with i = 1, . . . , N , and positions are obviated. The discrete VDF of such a system of particles is given by\nn\u22121 f (v, t ) = 1 N N\u2211 i=1 \u03b4(vi(t ) \u2212 v). (D1)\nAt the initialization of the system, the squared moduli of the particles velocities {v2i (0)} are drawn from a gamma distribution parameterized by \u3008v2(0)\u3009 = dkBT 0/m and \u3008v4(0)\u3009 = d (d + 2)(kBT 0/m)2(1 + a02). Next, the velocity vectors {vi(0)} are constructed from these moduli, with random directions. To enforce a vanishing initial total momentum, the velocity of every particle is subsequently subtracted by the amount N\u22121 \u2211 i vi(0).\nAfter initialization, velocities are updated from t to t + h (where the time step h is much smaller than the mean free time) by splitting the algorithm into two different stages: collisions and free streaming.\nDuring the collision stage, a number 12 N\u03c9maxh of pairs are randomly chosen with uniform probability, where \u03c9max is an upper bound estimate for the collision rate of one particle. Then, given a pair i j, the collision is accepted (acceptance-rejection Metropolis criterion) with probability (vi j \u00b7 \u03c3\u0302 i j )\u03c9i j/\u03c9max, where \u03c3\u0302 i j a random vector in the unit d-sphere and \u03c9i j = d\u03c3 d\u22121ngc|vi j \u00b7 \u03c3\u0302 i j | with d = 2\u03c0d/2/ (d/2) being the d-dimensional solid angle. If the collision is accepted for the given pair, then postcollisional velocities are assigned following the collisional rules for elastic hard spheres, namely vi, j \u2192 vi, j \u2213 (vi j \u00b7 \u03c3\u0302 i j )\u0302\u03c3 i j . If \u03c9i j > \u03c9max in one of the sampled pairs, then the collision is accepted and the estimate is updated as \u03c9max = \u03c9i j .\nDuring free streaming, velocities are updated according to the scheme given by (B9), namely\nvi(t ) \u2192 vi(t + h) \u2248 vi(t ) \u2212 \u03b6eff (vi(t ))vi(t )h + \u03be (vi(t )) \u221a hYi + O(h3/2), (D2)\nwhere Yi is a random vector drawn from the Gaussian probability distribution\nP(Y) = (2\u03c0 )\u2212d/2e\u2212Y 2/2. (D3) In our DSMC algorithm we took N = 104 threedimensional particles (d = 3) and chose a time step h = 10\u22122\u03bb/ \u221a 2kBTb/m, where \u03bb = ( \u221a 2\u03c0n\u03c3 2)\u22121 is the mean free path.\n054140-17"

There is also a general good agreement with the ESA results, while the BSA predictions exhibit important deviations in the initial stage, especially in the case of \u03bc6.
