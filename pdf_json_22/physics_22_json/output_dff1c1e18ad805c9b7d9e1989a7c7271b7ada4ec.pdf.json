The performance of evolutions under PT -symmetric Hamiltonians is degraded by the inevitable noise and errors due to system-environment interaction and experimental imperfections. In contrast to Hermitian Hamiltonians, the fluctuations in dissipative beams that are utilized to generate non-Hermitian contributions in the PT -symmetric Hamiltonians cause additional errors. Here we achieve the protection of PT -symmetric Hamiltonians against noise acting along the qubit\u2019s quantization axis by combining quantum evolutions with dynamical decoupling sequences. We demonstrate the performance of our method by numerical simulations. Realistic noise sources and parameters are chosen including: constant detuning error, time-varying detuning noise and dissipative-beam noise. The fidelities of the protected evolutions are well above the unprotected ones under all the above situations. Our work paves the way for further studies and applications of non-Hermitian PT -symmetric physics in noisy quantum systems.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn quantum mechanics, the Hermiticity requirement of Hamiltonians guarantees the energy of a system to be real. However, as demonstrated in [1], a class of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians satisfying parity-time (PT ) symmetry can still exhibit real eigenenergies. PT - symmetric Hamiltonians exhibit various exotic behaviors, in which a key property is PT -symmetry-breaking transitions that occur at an exceptional point (EP). EP is a point in the parameter space where the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the Hamiltonian coalesce [2\u20138]. Exotic properties of PT -symmetric systems have been experimentally studied in various classical systems [9\u201313]. This has stimulated many applications such as unidirectional light transport [14], single-mode lasers [15], optimal energy transfer [16] and enhanced sensing [17]. Recently, PT -symmetric Hamiltonians are also constructed in genuine quantum systems, e.g., ultracold atoms [4], NV-centers [5], trapped ions [6, 7], and superconducting quantum circuits [18]. These allow quantum signatures such as perfect quantum coherence at EP to be revealed [6]. The novel character of PT -symmetric Hamiltonians are also expected to play an important role in quantum control. For example, faster-than-Hermitian quantum mechanics evolutions could be achieved [2, 3]; topological structure of exceptional points could be utilized to realize robust quantum control [19].\nIn order to study and utilize PT -symmetric properties in quantum systems, one needs to construct general\n\u2217 These authors contributed equally to this work. \u2020 luole5@mail.sysu.edu.cn\nquantum evolutions (UPT) under PT -symmetric Hamiltonians (HPT), e.g., a faster-than-Hermitian quantum mechanics evolution [2, 3], or encircling an exceptional point [19]. As the unavoidable environmental perturbations degrade the performance of quantum gates and evolutions, protecting the system against noise and errors is key to further studies. Apart from the noise sources such as magnetic field noise and detuning errors that are common to Hermitian systems, additional noise sources present in PT -symmetric quantum systems. For example, a natural and popular way to construct PT - symmetric Hamiltonian is through the application of a dissipative beam [4, 7]. However, the fluctuations and errors in dissipative beams usually become the dominant error sources in these experiments [7]. Developing methods to mitigate the above noise and errors is thus a vital step towards exploring PT -symmetric physics in quantum systems, but so far related studies is still lacking.\nHere we demonstrate the protection of UPT by dynamical decoupling (DD) [20\u201325]. DD is a popular method to protect the quantum system against static or timedependent environmental noise [21, 23]. By applying a series of control operations to the quantum system, the unwanted system-environment interaction could be cancelled to a large extent. DD has been utilized to protect both quantum memories (null operations) [22, 23, 26\u2013 28] and quantum gates (arbitrary evolutions) [29\u201336], without additional qubits. In this work, we first demonstrate how to modify general quantum evolutions under PT -symmetric Hamiltonians in such a way that they can be combined with DD operations, thus achieving the desired evolution goal under DD protection. We then present numerical simulations of general UPT under realistic noise sources including: constant detuning ar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n01 48\n1v 2\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n1 A\npr 2\n02 2\n2 error, time-varying detuning noise and importantly, dissipation beam noise. The performance of DD-protected evolutions is significantly better than unprotected ones in all these situations. To our knowledge, this is the first time that dynamical decoupling bridges to the nonHermitian Hamiltonian. We not only demonstrate for the first time that PT -symmetric Hamiltonians can be protected against environmental noises, but also provide a novel DD scheme to realize such protection. Experiments using our method for trapped ion qubits is currently being implemented in our lab. This work pioneer a new research route, enabling studies and applications of non-Hermitian PT -symmetric physics with noisy quantum systems."

            "text": "The PT -symmetric Hamiltonian considerded here reads\nHPT = 2i\u0393Iz + 2JIx, (1)\nwhere\nIx = 1\n2\n( 0 1 1 0 ) , Iy = 1\n2\n( 0 \u2212i i 0 ) , Iz = 1\n2\n( 1 0 0 \u22121 ) are angular momentum operators and \u0393, J are real parameters. Indeed, [PT, HPT] = 0, satsifying the PT requirement, where P = 2Ix, T = \u2217 denotes complex conjugation operation. The exceptional point is located at \u0393 = J . When \u0393 < J , the system is in the PT - symmetry preserving phase, and when \u0393 > J , it is in the PT -symmetry broken phase. This Hamiltonian has not been directly implemented in quantum systems due to the difficulties in realizing the gain on |0\u3009. It has been constructed by e.g., a dilation method using two qubits [5]. Alternatively, a popular way to study HPT is to use a dissipative scheme that generates a state-dependent loss in a single qubit, as is done in, e.g., cold atoms [4], superconducting circuits [18], and trapped ions [6, 7]. In these experiments, the qubit levels |0\u3009 and |1\u3009 are coupled by a control field (e.g., a microwave field) with coupling strength J , and a loss of population on |1\u3009 with effective loss rate 4\u0393 is constructed, here |0\u3009 (|1\u3009) are eigenstates of Iz with eigenvalues 1 2 (\u2212 1 2 ). This will generate a passive PT -symmetric Hamiltonian\nH\u0303PT = 2JIx \u2212 2i\u0393|1\u3009\u30081| = 2i\u0393Iz + 2JIx \u2212 i\u0393I, (2)\nwhere I is the identity matrix and \u0393 \u2265 0 because the dissipation rate cannot be made negative. The state evolution |\u03c8(t)\u3009 under the original PT -symmetric Hamiltonian HPT could be recovered by multiplying a factor e \u0393t to the state |\u03c8\u0303(t)\u3009 evolving under H\u0303PT. As the factor e\u0393t does not affect the EP or the essential dynamics of the PT -symmetric systems, it is irrelevant in typical studies on PT -symmetric physics [3, 18, 37], the protection\nof U(H\u0303PT, T ) is thus considered equivalent to the protection of U(HPT, T ) in this work. The population loss could be achieved experimentally by adding a dissipation beam [7], as illustrated in Fig.1, (a). Note that the fluctuations and errors in dissipative beams usually become the dominant error sources [7], and is exclusive to non-Hermitian-Hamiltonian construction.\nIII. DYNAMICAL DECOUPLING PROTECTED EVOLUTIONS UNDER PT -SYMMETRIC\nHAMILTONIANS\nThe dynamics of the qubit in a general decohering environment is governed in a semi-classical picture by a Hamiltonian of the form [25]\nH = H\u0303PT +Hn\n= [2i\u0393 + 2i\u03b4\u0393(t) + 2\u03b2(t)]Iz + [2J + \u03b1(t)]Ix \u2212 i[\u0393 + \u03b4\u0393(t)]I, (3) where Hn = [2i\u03b4\u0393(t) + 2\u03b2(t)]Iz + \u03b1(t)Ix \u2212 i\u03b4\u0393(t)I is the noise Hamiltonian. \u03b1, \u03b2 represent random fields imparted by the environment, and we explicitly use \u03b4\u0393(t) to represent noise in dissipative beam. In the following we only consider noises coupled to Iz and set \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b2, \u03b4\u0393 6= 0. \u03b2 and \u03b4\u0393 could also represent experimental imperfections and errors.\nIn order to protect the system from unwanted environmental noise, while still achieving the evolution under H\u0303PT for time T (U(H\u0303PT, T )), we can split the target evolution into pieces and insert them in the free precession intervals of a standard DD sequence.\n3 III.1. Protection based on a CPMG-like sequence\nTo demonstrate the main idea, we first choose a simple Carl-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG)-like sequence [22] as the basic DD sequence, and add the control Hamiltonian H at the end of it in each cycle [34], as demonstrated in Fig. 1, (b). The evolution of the system for one cycle in this sequence is\nU = N\u220f k=1 U(Hk, \u03c4k)Pk, (4)\nhere \u03c4k = \u03c4 , N = 2, and Pk are \u03c0 rotations along y axes. Pk are assumed to be instantaneous and perfect, thus the total duration of one cycle \u03c4c = 2\u03c4 . H1 = Hn which means we let the system evolves freely during this period, and the evolution is governed only by noise terms. H2 = H meaning that the control pulses are presented during this period. The sequence is repeated m times, with the effective evolution time (under H\u0303PT) T = m\u03c4 . This sequence is simple in that the evolution under H does not need to be split in one cycle, similar to the DDprotected gates studied in [34]. This sequence provides\nfirst order protection for U(H\u0303PT, T ) [29]. To show this result, we use average Hamiltonian theory [38].\nAverage Hamiltonian theory states that an evolution U(\u03c4c), such as a DD cycle under a time dependent Hamiltonian, can be described by an evolution governed by an effective time-independent (or average) Hamiltonian\nH\u0304 = H\u0304(1) + H\u0304(2) + H\u0304(3) + ..., (5)\nwhere H\u0304(k) represents kth order approximation [29]. The explict expressions for H\u0304(k) could be found in e.g., [34, 38] by calculating the Magnus expansion, and the first-order approximation is\nH\u0304(1) = 1\n\u03c4c \u222b \u03c4c 0 dtH(t). (6)\nAssume \u03c4 and m are chosen such that \u03b2 and \u03b4\u0393 are kept nearly constant in a single cycle. As P1 = P2 = \u2212P \u20201 , the evolution P2U(H1, \u03c4)P1 is equivalent (omitting the irrelevant global phase) to\nU(H \u2032, \u03c4) = e\u2212iH \u2032\u03c4 = e\u2212iP1H1P \u2020 1 \u03c4 , (7)\nwhere\nH \u2032 = P1H1P \u2020 1 = \u2212Hn \u2212 2i\u03b4\u0393I. (8)\nThe evolution for one cycle under first-order approximation is then\nU(\u03c4) = U(H2, \u03c4)P2U(H1, \u03c4)P1 = U(H, \u03c4)U(H \u2032, \u03c4)\n= e\u2212iH\u0304\u03c4c \u2248 e\u2212iH\u0304 (1)\u03c4c = e\u2212i( \u03c4 \u03c4c (H+H\u2032))\u03c4c\n= e\u2212iH\u0303PT\u03c4e\u22122\u03b4\u0393\u03c4 .\n(9)\nSo the evolution for m cycle is\nUm(\u03c4) =\nm\u220f U(\u03c4) \u2248 e\u2212iH\u0303PTT e\u22122\u03b4\u0303\u0393T . (10)\nwhere \u03b4\u0303\u0393 is the average of \u03b4\u0393 over m cycles. If the dissipative beam noise is not presented, i.e., \u03b4\u0393 = 0, we have Um = U(H\u0303PT, T ). That is, we achieve first order protection of the desired evolution U(H\u0303PT, T ). If \u03b4\u0393 6= 0, Um will differ from U(H\u0303PT, T ) by a factor e\u22122\u03b4\u0304\u0393T . In practice, this is not a concern (also discussed in Sec. II), as the EP remains unchanged with or without this factor. The transition from PT -symmetry preserving phase to PT -symmetry broken phase, as well as the essential dynamics are not affected by this factor either [7]. So the sequences presented in this work are still con-\nsidered to achieve the protection of U(H\u0303PT, T ) with the irrelevant factor e\u22122\u03b4\u0304\u0393T ignored. The above sequence achieves first-order protection, because the noise term Hn in H \u2032 changes sign, and cancels out Hn in H, when adding H and H \u2032 in (9). As it is more convenient to start with a sequence where J and \u0393 are applied simultaneously, plus the fact that \u0393 \u2265 0 cannot be made negative, we design the sequence with evolutions under Hn alone to achieve the cancellation [34]. Otherwise, the 2i\u0393Iz term between two DD pulses will also change sign and cancel out with the following 2i\u0393Iz term, and the protection scheme is failed.\nVariations of \u03b2(t) and \u03b4\u0393(t) between successive evolutions under Hk in a single cycle reduces the fidelity of the operation at the conclusion of the sequence. Nevertheless, a high enough fidelity could still be achieved using sufficiently small \u03c4 , as demonstrated by the numerical simulation in Sec. IV. Note that more robust DD sequences e.g., XY \u2212 4 or KDD sequence [22], might also be utilized to achieve the protection. Here for simplicity we use the DD sequence with a single rotation axis to demonstrate the main idea.\nIII.2. Protection based on the CPMG sequence\n4 The sequence presented in the above subsection could be upgraded to achieve higher-order protection. It is proved that if H(t) is symmetric over one cycle, i.e., H(t) = H(\u03c4c \u2212 t) (0 \u2264 t \u2264 \u03c4c), then all even order average Hamiltonian terms are equal to zero [34, 38]. This allows us to design a protection scheme based on the exact CPMG sequence [22] as shown in Fig. 2, where N = 3, P1 = I, P2,3 are \u03c0 rotations along y axes, H1 = H3 = H, H2 = Hn, and \u03c41 = \u03c43 = \u03c42/2 = \u03c4/2. The evolution operator for one cycle up to the second order approximation is then (omitting the irrelevant global phase)\nU = U(H3, \u03c4/2)P3U(H2, \u03c4)P2U(H1, \u03c4/2)\n= U(H, \u03c4/2)U(H \u2032, \u03c4)U(H, \u03c4/2)\n= e\u2212iH\u0304\u03c4c \u2248 e\u2212i(H\u0304 (1)+H\u0304(2))\u03c4c ,\n(11)\nwhere H \u2032 is the same as (8). As\nH\u0304(1) = 1\n\u03c4c (2H\u03c4/2 +H \u2032\u03c4) =\n1 2 (H\u0303PT \u2212 2i\u03b4\u0393I),\nand [38]\nH\u0304(2) = 1\n2i\u03c4c {[H \u2032, H1]\n\u03c42\n2 + [H3, H1]\n\u03c42\n4 + [H3, H\n\u2032] \u03c42\n2 }\n= 0,\nthe evolution for one cycle up to second order approximation is then\nU \u2248 e\u2212iH\u0303PT\u03c4e\u22122\u03b4\u0393\u03c4 ,\nand Um \u2248 e\u2212iH\u0303PTT e\u22122\u03b4\u0303\u0393T . This sequence thus achieves second-order protection (actually all H\u0304(k) with even k equal 0), and is more effective than the one in Fig. 1, (b). It is more complicated in that H is split and placed before and after the DD sequence in one cycle. More advanced sequences, e.g., the concatenated DD (CDD) and the non-equidistant Uhrig DD (UDD) can achieve arbitraryorder protections for a \u201cno operation\u201d [22]. CDD-like sequences are further utilized to achieve the protection of arbitrary gates to any given order [35], but the ability to realize the inverse of the gate operation (without affecting the noise terms during the gate operation) is required, and are thus not directly applicable in protecting H\u0303PT where \u0393 cannot be negative. This interesting difference between Hermitian and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian protection, as well as the higher-order protection of H\u0303PT are worth further investigation."

The \u201cnon-Hermitian\u201d means the gate is realized by evolving under a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. When J < \u0393, the density matrix will rapidly converge to a steady value [7], and the error between \u03c1id and \u03c1m(\u03c4) will be bounded, thus in order to demonstrate the performance of the protection scheme, we mainly focus on J > \u0393 in the following simulation. In the first three subsections, the protection scheme is based on the CPMG-like sequence as introduced in Sec. III.1. In the last subsection, we demonstrate results obtained from the scheme based on the CPMG sequence (Sec. III.2). In the following simulations, the DD pulses are assumed to be perfect. |\u03c8(t = 0)\u3009 = |0\u3009 or |1\u3009. The cycle number m is 2, 4 or 8. The noises are generated from Gaussian or uniform distributions. In one round of the simulation, the noise is piecewise constant with period p, and we set p = 2\u03c4 , although the noise and the sequence have same periods, they are not synchronized with each other, i.e., the noises might undergo a sudden change during the \u03c4 intervals of the sequence. The simulation is repeated 10000 times with the noises drawn from the same distribution, and the final density matrix \u03c1m(\u03c4) is obtained by averaging [7]. The fidelities are calculated by (12). We vary J , \u03c4 , parameters of the noise distributions, and plot the corresponding fidelities.\n5 IV.1. Constant detuning error\nFirst we consider constant detuning error, i.e., \u03b2 is a constant. The detuning error could be caused by, e.g., a miscalibration of the quantization magnetic field. \u03b4\u0393 = 0 in this subsection. In Fig. 3, (a), the performance of UNOT with and without DD protection is illustrated. Here m = 2, J = 10 kHz, \u0393 = 1 kHz, |\u03c8(t = 0)\u3009 = |1\u3009, \u03c4 = TNOT/2 = 73.9 \u00b5s. From the simulation results, we see that the fidelity of the DD protected gate remains high, while the fidelity of the unprotected gate drops quickly as the detuning error is increased.\nTo show that our method is also capable of protecting an arbitrary evolution, we choose |\u03c8(t = 0)\u3009 = |0\u3009 and vary \u03c4 of the sequence, with fixed \u03b2 = 2000\u03c0 Hz, m = 2, J = 10 kHz, \u0393 = 1 kHz, to realize arbitrary evolutions U(H\u0303PT, T = 2\u03c4). The result is shown in Fig. 3, (b). The fidelity of the DD protected evolution remains close to 1 when \u03c4 is small, in contrast to the unprotected evolution. The fidelity of the DD protected evolution eventually drops as \u03c4 gets larger. The oscillations of the fidelities are related to the fact that all the elements of \u03c1id(T )\nare evolving with a period Tp = \u03c0/ \u221a J2 \u2212 \u03932 \u2248 320\u00b5s, i.e., \u03c1id(T ) = \u03c1id(T + kTp)(k is an integer) when \u0393 < J .\nIn Fig. 3, (c), (d), we fix m = 2, \u0393 = 1 kHz, |\u03c8(t = 0)\u3009 = |0\u3009, \u03b2 = 2000\u03c0 Hz, and vary \u03c4 \u2208 [0, 200] \u00b5s and\nJ \u2208 [1, 10] kHz. The dashed black line represents the contour with F = 0.999 (in the region \u03c4 < 100 \u00b5s). It is clear that the protected evolution has good performance (e.g., F > 0.999) in a wider range of \u03c4 and J than the unprotected one.\nIV.2. Time-varying detuning noise\nNext, we consider time-varying detuning noise. The noise is modeled as a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation \u03c3. It is piecewise constant with period p = 2\u03c4 (it is not synchronized with the DD pulses as explained above Sec. IV.1). To calculate the fidelity, the whole process is repeated 10000 times, and the final density matrix is obtained by averaging. \u03b4\u0393 = 0 in this subsection. In Fig. 4, (a), m = 8, J = 1 kHz, \u0393 = 0.5 kHz, |\u03c8(t = 0)\u3009 = |1\u3009, \u03c4 = TNOT/8 = 151.2 \u00b5s, and the fidelity of UNOT is plotted as \u03c3 is varied. It is clear that the performance of the protected gate is better than the unprotected one. In Fig. 4, (b), m = 4, J = 1 kHz, \u0393 = 0.5 kHz, |\u03c8(t = 0)\u3009 = |0\u3009, \u03c3 = 1.2 kHz, and the fidelity of U(H\u0303PT, T = 4\u03c4) versus \u03c4 is plotted. Again, the performance of the protected evolution is better than the unprotected one at small \u03c4 . The fidelity of the protected evolution starts to drop as \u03c4 gets larger. Oscillations of the fidelities similar to Fig. 3, (b) are also observed.\nIn Fig. 4, (c), (d), we fix m = 4, \u0393 = 1.2 kHz,\n6 |\u03c8(t = 0)\u3009 = |0\u3009, \u03c3 = 1.2 kHz, and vary \u03c4 \u2208 [0, 1.6] ms and J \u2208 [1, 3] kHz. The dashed black line represents the contour with F = 0.999 (in the region \u03c4 < 0.64 ms). It is clear that the protected evolution has good performance (e.g., F > 0.999) in a wider range of \u03c4 and J than the unprotected one. When J < \u0393, the fidelities of the unprotected and protected evolutions are both high, as explained above Sec. IV.1.\nIV.3. Time-varying dissipative-beam noise\nNext, we consider the time-varying dissipative-beam noise, which is genuine to evolutions under nonHermitian Hamiltonians. The noise \u03b4\u0393 could be caused by e.g., the stray light along the dissipative beam path. In more complicated experiments where multiple dissipative beams are needed [40], \u03b4\u0393 could also be caused by imperfections in other dissipative beams that are not intended to affect the population on |1\u3009. \u03b4\u0393 is modeled to obey random uniform distribution in the range [0, w]. It is piecewise constant with period p = 2\u03c4 (it is not synchronized with the DD pulses as explained above Sec. IV.1). The whole process is repeated 10000 times and the density matrix is obtained by averaging. \u03b2 = 0 in this subsection. In Fig. 5, (a), we choose m = 8, J = 1 kHz, \u0393 = 0.5 kHz, |\u03c8(t = 0)\u3009 = |1\u3009, \u03c4 = TNOT/8 = 151.2 \u00b5s. The fidelity of the non-Hermitian NOT gate is plotted against the strength of the dissipative-beam noise w, and the fidelity of the DD protected gate is higher than the unprotected one. In Fig. 5, (b), m = 4, J = 1 kHz, \u0393 = 0.5 kHz, |\u03c8(t = 0)\u3009 = |0\u3009, w = 100 Hz, and the fidelity of U(HPT, 4\u03c4) is plotted with increasing \u03c4 . The performance of the protected evolution is better than the unprotected one. Oscillations of the fidelities similar to Fig. 3, (b) are also observed.\nIn Fig. 5, (c), (d), we fix m = 4, \u0393 = 0.5 kHz, |\u03c8(t = 0)\u3009 = |0\u3009, w = 100 Hz, and vary \u03c4 \u2208 [0, 3] ms and J \u2208 [1, 3] kHz. The dashed black line represents the contour with F = 0.999 (in the region \u03c4 < 2.4 ms). The protected evolution has good performance (e.g., F > 0.999) in a wider range of \u03c4 and J than the unprotected one.\nIV.4. Protection based on the CPMG sequence\nFinally, we further present the performance of protection based on the CPMG sequence (s2) discussed in Sec. III.2, which achieves second-order protection, and compare it with the unprotected evolution and the CPMGlike sequence (s1). In Fig.6, (a), m = 4, J = 10 kHz, \u0393 = 1 kHz. To show the generality of our scheme, we consider simultaneous existence of constant errors \u03b2 = 2000\u03c0 Hz and \u03b4\u0393 = 2000 Hz, and set |\u03c8(t = 0)\u3009 = 1/ \u221a 2(|0\u3009+ |1\u3009). The fidelity of the evolution under s2 is above s1 and the unprotected evolution.\nIn Fig.6, (b,c,d), m = 4, J \u2208 [6, 10] kHz, \u0393 = 1 kHz, |\u03c8(t = 0)\u3009 = 1/ \u221a 2(|0\u3009 + |1\u3009), and \u03c4 \u2208 [0, 80] \u00b5s.

(b) Fidelity of the unprotected evolution U(HPT, 4\u03c4) (black, dashed) and the protected one (red, solid) versus \u03c4 . Here m = 4, J = 1 kHz, \u0393 = 0.5 kHz, |\u03c8(t = 0)\u3009 = |0\u3009 and \u03b4\u0393 \u2208 [0, w = 100 Hz]. (c,d) Fidelity of the unprotected evolution U(HPT, 4\u03c4) (c) and the protected one (d) with m = 4, J \u2208 [1, 3] kHz, \u0393 = 0.5 kHz, |\u03c8(t = 0)\u3009 = |0\u3009, \u03c4 \u2208 [0, 3] ms, and w = 100 kHz. The dashed black line represents the contour with F = 0.999 (in the region \u03c4 < 2.4 ms).\nfurther demonstrate the generality of our scheme, we still consider simultaneous existence of constant errors \u03b2 and \u03b4\u0393, while this time we pick \u03b2 from a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation \u03c3 = 1200 Hz, and \u03b4\u0393 from a uniform distribution in the range [0, w = 100] Hz in each repetition of the simulation. The simulation is repeated 10000 times (at each (\u03c4, J)), and the density matrix is obtained by averaging. The fidelities of s2 and s1 are higher than the unprotected evolution in a wide range of \u03c4 and J (F > 0.93 for s1 and F > 0.999 for s2 in the chosen range). Thanks to the ability to reach secondorder protection, the fidelity of s2 is also higher than s1 in a wide range of \u03c4 and J .\nFrom these simulation results, it is clear that the DDprotected non-Hermitian evolutions have better performance than unprotected ones under noises acting along the quantization axis, indicating the effectiveness of our method."

The fidelities of the protected evolutions are well\nabove the unprotected ones under all the above situations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. We thus conclude that we have theoretically demonstrated the protection of PT -symmetric Hamiltonians against noise and errors. Experiments using this method in a trapped ion quantum processor is being implemented in our lab. Our work paves the way for further studies and applications of non-Hermitian PT -symmetric physics in noisy environment.\nACKNOWLEGMENTS\nWe thank the reviewer for helpful comments.
