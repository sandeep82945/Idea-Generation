Smart devices create opportunities to improve AF management. This paper aimed to evaluate the inhouse developed AF-EduApp application on its usability, satisfaction, and communication effectiveness with the care team. Methods: Duringamulticenter, prospective randomizedcontrolled trial, 153AFpatients were included in the AF-EduApp study, with a minimum follow-up of 12 months and a maximum follow-up of 15months if taking oral anticoagulation (OAC). The AF-EduApp contains six main modules: Questionnaires, Education, Measurement data entry, Medication overview with reminders, Appointments, and Communication with the care team. The App focuses on four main goals: (1) to improve AF knowledge, (2) to increase self-care capabilities, (3) electronic monitoring to improve therapy adherence to OAC, and (4) communication with the care team. Patients unable to use the AF-EduApp were assigned to a no-App control group (n=41) without intervention comparable to the standard care group (SC, n=346) of the AF-EduCare study. Results: A total of 152 patients effectively used the App during a mean follow-up of 386.8\u00b1 108. 1 days (one included patient could not install the application due to an iPhone from the United States). They opened the application on average on 130.1 \u00b1 144.7 days. Of the 109 patients still in follow-up after 12 months (i.e. patients who did not withdraw and on OAC), 90 patients (82.6%) actively used the application at least one day in the next 41 days. The Measurement module was the most used, with a median of used days over the total available days of 6.4%. A total of 75 App patients (49.3%) asked questions, mostly clinical-related questions (e.g. medication use, or actionability on clinical entered parameters). A mean score of 8.1 \u00b1 1.7 about the \u201cperceived quality of follow-up in the past year\u201d was given by the App ITT patients, compared to a score of 7.7 \u00b1 2.0 by the SC group (P= .072). Patients who used the App were more attracted to future follow-up with an application compared to patients who would be capable of using the application of the SC group (31.6% vs. 12.5%; P < .001). Conclusion: This study showed a positive attitude towards using a mobile application, with AF patients using the application one-third of the available days. Patients used the App most for entering measured parameters, and to contact the care team.\nKEYWORDS\natrial fibrillation, mHealth, mobile application, integrated care, education\n01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "With a lifetime risk of one in three, AF is the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia, affecting 59 million people globally (1, 2). This arrhythmia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, including potentially life-threatening complications such as stroke or heart failure (3). The management of AF is based on three pillars, also called the ABC pathway: (A) avoiding stroke with anticoagulation treatment, (B) better symptom control based on rate and rhythm control strategies, and (C) cardiovascular risk factor management. A recently published study showed that following the ABC approach was linked to greater health-related quality of life and a significantly decreased risk of the composite outcome of all-cause death and any thromboembolism in secondary prevention AF patients (4). This was also confirmed by the review of Stevens et al., which showed that patients receiving care following the ABC pathway had significantly lower risks of stroke, myocardial infarction, and death (5). However, recent studies have revealed that the ABC strategy is still not being followed to its full potential. More particularly, around 1 in 5 patients do not receive ABC-based care (6\u20138). As the ABC pathway shows, the management of AF is complex and needs to be patient-tailored. Accordingly, patient education and involvement are crucial to allow shared-decision making. This shared-decision making is only achievable if patients with AF are adequately educated about their condition and its management. Education as the entry point to involvement in their personal care was the foundation of a large, multicenter, randomized controlled trial, the AF-EduCare study. This study compares in-person and online-driven educational follow-ups to standard care (9). The current study is a derivative of this larger trial.\nIn the past decades, smartphones have become more popular and indispensable devices for the general population. Even in the 65 + age population, smartphones became the second most important device after a portable computer (PC) (10). In Belgium, smartphone ownership increased from 48% in 2017 to 82% in 2021 in this population, which is comparable with other countries and age populations (10\u201312). Such devices allow for a remote follow-up of patients, supplementing other forms of care, hence creating more continuous care. Besides, they can be ideal tools to educate patients on different aspects of their condition. This digital growth led to the in-house development of the AF-EduApp (13). This allowed us to follow up with AF patients with more opportunities and functionalities compared to online follow-up. Given the similar follow-up strategy to the AF-EduCare study, the AF-EduApp study (NCT03788044) was added as a fourth study arm to the AF-EduCare study. The primary outcome parameter of the AF-EduApp study was to improve therapy adherence to oral anticoagulation (OAC) by using this educational smartphone application with an integrated medication list and reminders. The results showed that patients who installed a medication reminder had a higher therapy adherence to OAC than those patients who used the app but did not install a medication reminder (14). Other outcome parameters such as AF knowledge, self-care capabilities, AF symptom burden and quality of life are expected in the first half of 2024. The current report focuses\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 02\non patients\u2019 satisfaction with the application and the usability of the application-driven follow-up strategy."

The validation process consisted of three parts: (1) an expert panel gave feedback about the content and functionality; (2) ten AF patients expressed orally what they thought of the application while using it in the presence of a researcher; (3) 20 AF patients used the application during a pilot study of one month.\nNext, the in-house developed and optimized AF-EduApp application was made available for smartphones and tablets on IOS or Android for the AF-EduApp study. Every patient had a unique log-in and received access to the six different modules (Supplementary Figure S1): i.e., (i) an Education module about AF and its treatment which was available 24/7 (except when the knowledge questionnaire had to be completed); (ii) a Questionnaire module including various questionnaires that patients were requested to complete during the study; (iii) a module in which patients could record their medication list, and had the possibility to install an alarm when they had to take a specific medication. They also could record whether they had taken the medication; (iv) a module to enter measured parameters such as weight and blood pressure; (v) a module where upcoming appointments could be inserted and (vi) lastly a module with contact information and a chat box in case of questions for the care team. Of note, the patients had no predefined instructions on how often and how to use the App. They were free to decide how frequently they wanted to use it (except for the questionnaires that needed to be completed within specific time frames and were presented automatically)."

In short, the intervention\u2019s (AF-EduCare/AF-EduApp) primary focus is improving patients\u2019 knowledge about AF and its treatment. Based on this improved knowledge, two other aspects of AF treatment are targeted: promoting self-care skills based on individual risk factors for AF and increasing adherence to OAC therapy. The easy reachability of the AF team was also part of the AF-EduCare/AF-EduApp approach. Patients were randomly assigned to the four study groups: in-person education, online education, App-driven education, and standard care (SC).\nBoth trials were approved by the Ethical committees of the participating centers, and the studies have been conducted in\nfrontiersin.org\ncompliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. More details on the AF-EduCare study design have already been described by Delesie et al. (9). In addition, baseline demographics of the screened AF population (n = 1.979) for the AF-EduCare/AF-EduApp have been described, including a CONSORT diagram and more details on the 1.232 included AF patients (15). As this analysis focuses on the AF-EduApp group, the study protocol of the AF-EduApp study arm will be explained in more detail below. The focus of this report is the methods used to assess patient satisfaction, communication, and App engagement. The SC group (n = 346) was used to compare patient satisfaction with the AF-EduApp study arm (n = 194). This SC group had a comparable clinical profile due to stratification with the randomization procedure."

Patients were excluded if they could not speak Dutch, were cognitively impaired, had a life expectancy estimated to be less than a year, were pregnant, or participated in other clinical trials. There was one randomization procedure for both the AF-EduCare and AF-EduApp studies. Possibility to work with a smartphone application was not used as an inclusion criterion in order to perform both on treatment and intention to treat analyses. Therefore, patients randomly assigned to the App-driven education group could be divided into those who can (eligible; App group) and cannot (non-eligible; no-App group) follow App-driven education, i.e., based on the availability of a smartphone/tablet and the ability of the patient to use it.

App user data were described until 12 or 15 months, depending on whether patients had therapy adherence monitoring or not. Therapy adherence monitoring was performed with AF patients treated with an OAC at baseline or initiated during the study. These patients were monitored with the MEMS cap at the beginning of the study (Monitoring 1, M1) and again after one year (Monitoring 2, M2), each time for a period of three months. The MEMS cap fits on a medication bottle, and each time the bottle is opened, data is stored in the MEMS cap build-in memory card. The study team extracted the data from the cap at the 3- and 15-months follow-up visits. Regimen adherence was calculated as the proportion of days with the correct number of openings as recorded by MEMS, once or twice daily, depending on the dosing regimen."

This calculation included improved therapy adherence from 89.63% \u00b1 14.48% (17) to 96.84% by the application-driven intervention. Considering that 64.4% of the AF population is on OAC (16), a sample size of 153 patients was calculated who had to use the application. The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 28.0. (IBM, Armonk, USA). Normal distribution was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test. As appropriate, variables were described as numbers and percentages, as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR). For continuous variables, the Mann-Withney U test was used to compare two groups and the Kruskal Wallis for two or more categories. The chi-squared test was used for categorical variables. P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Because patients were followed up over time and user data was analyzed, participation statuses (yes/no) obtained from the same patient were expected to be correlated. Ignoring correlation would typically result in underestimating standard errors and hence wrong conclusions (18). Therefore, a generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was constructed using participation as a binary outcome, a logit link function, and an autoregressive working correlation (19)."

However, at the end of the study (410\u2013451 days), 81% (76/94 patients) of the active patients used the application at least once.\nAlmost all patients viewed most modules at least once (i.e.,: Questionnaires: 152; Medication: 151; Measurements: 150; Communication: 150; Appointments: 149; Education: 135). A median percentage was calculated based on how many days a patient used a module over the total number of follow-up days of that patient (Figure 2A).

When asked which follow-up methods patients would prefer for future care, the weighted percentage showed that follow-up by a physician was most chosen in both groups (App ITT: 39.0%, SC: 47.9%; P = .112) (Figure 5C).

As expected, more patients in the Appcapable groups would prefer follow-up with an application (31.6% vs. 4.4%; P = .001 and 12.5% vs. 2.6%; P < .001, respectively). Patients who were effectively followed up with the App indicated less need for follow-up with a physician (34.6% vs. 43.9%; P = .046) than the SC App-capable group. In addition, they indicated significantly more that they preferred follow-up with an App (31.6% vs. 12.5%; P < .001) compared with the SC App-capable group. Looking at the total number of patients, 56 of the 134 App patients (41.8%) prefer the use of an application as part of their follow-up compared to 42 of the 189 SC App capable patients (22.2%) (p < 0.001).\nLooking specifically at intervention satisfaction, almost three in four App patients (98/134; 73.1%) would participate again in this project in the future, and 114 (85.1%) were more motivated to be actively engaged in their health due to the extra education.

            "text": "In the literature, only a few App-based educational efforts for AF patients have been described: i.e., theUNCAF app,mAFA app,MyAF app, and the Health Buddies app (20\u201323). Pattern Health (Durham, NC) developed the UNC AF app to deliver AF education (including videos) over four weeks. Moreover, patients could also track parameters, medication adherence, AF symptoms, and self-reported exercise (20). A total of nine patients participated in the focus groups with the UNC AF app. In those patients, retention was 80% after one week and only 32% after four weeks. The mAFA app mainly focused on clinical decision support for physicians but also incorporated patient education and patient self-care components (21). Satisfaction was assessed for the mAFA application after one month, with 110 of the 113 patients using the application. The MyAF application is linked with a physician application to share symptoms and quality of life. In addition, this application also provides education on AF and its treatment (22). No user or usability data were described. Lastly, the Health Buddies app was based on daily challenges between the AF patient and their grandchildren to improve AF knowledge and OAC therapy adherence (23). A total of 15 patients started using the application, with a mean percentage of logged-in days of 57.7% and a significant decrease in app use by the patients after 90 days (P = .009). Despite these applications being studied and used, little is written about their usability and how long patients used them. During the 1-month pilot study of the AF-EduApp, a significant reduction in the odds of app use was seen from 100% of patients using the application at the beginning to 30% using the application after one month (13). These results, in combination with the results of this report, show that it is hard to motivate patients to use the application for extended\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 09\nperiods. Within our study, a higher percentage of patients used the application during periods in which questionnaires were presented to them compared to periods without questionnaires. According to our knowledge, this is the first paper reflecting on daily use for such a long period of follow-up. Given that the patients could use the AFEduApp according to their own needs (except when questionnaires were presented), it is encouraging to see that the App was used one third of the time for about one year.\nDuring the focus groups with the UNC AF app, patients found it too time-consuming to input all the measurement data themselves (20). Also, during the AF-EduApp pilot study, it was suggested to couple the App to other healthcare devices to allow automatic parameter entries (13). In general, it is seen that patient adherence to these instruments decreases as the amount of work required of them increases (24). However, due to time constraints and technical issues, this was not yet implemented in the AF-EduApp. As the Measurement module was the most used during this longer follow-up study, it proves that such automatic data integration may be a priority for future development.\nIn contrast to the pilot study, where the Education module was the second most used module, it was now the least used module. One reason could be that patients find additional information useful, but only once or when they have a specific question (e.g., about their treatment and self-care, as this was the most visited module). Possibly a more important reason is the fact that patients were given the knowledge questionnaire (JAKQ) five times during their one-year follow-up, which forms the basis of the AFEduCare/AF-EduApp approach (9). By increasing patients\u2019 knowledge with targeted education, we wanted to ensure that patients are more engaged in their AF care. Given that patients of the App group already had a JAKQ score of \u00b170% at baseline and the JAKQ was frequently given, this could provide them with the feeling that they already have enough knowledge resulting in less time spent on the Education module. Despite identical baseline knowledge (AF diagnosis <1 month: 69.6 \u00b1 16.9% vs. AF diagnosis >1 month: 69.8 \u00b1 14.6%; P = .920), it was surprising to see a significant difference in the number of days patients with recent\nfrontiersin.org\nAF diagnoses spent in the Education module compared to those with older diagnoses. However, there was no significant difference in the time spent in the Education module between patients with a recent or those with a longer AF diagnosis. This indicates a difference in the usage of the Education module between those patient groups, possibly related to time since basic AF information was given with AF diagnosis. For example, patients with a longer diagnosis appear to watch the education more often with shorter sessions spread over several days (i.e., longer time since AF basic information and need for specific information), while patients with a recent diagnosis are more likely to view education in one long episode (i.e., still need to absorb all the information).\nIntriguingly, significantly more patients with a recent diagnosis discontinued the trial earlier (i.e., <12 months of follow-up) compared to patients with a longer diagnosis (p < 0.001). This also seems to result in fewer days with App use for this patient group. It could be that a more intensive follow-up for patients with a recent diagnosis is too overwhelming, as 27.8% of the patients quit after one month. This definitely requires further study because it is contrary to what seems medically appropriate.\nAs the primary goal of the educational application was to improve therapy adherence, it is positive to see that the Medication module was the second most used module, with 138 of the 152 patients creating a medication list and 74.6% of the patients setting a reminder. However, therapy adherence calculated based on patients\u2019 own recording of medication intake is embarrassingly low. Given that the actual regimen adherence as measured with electronic monitoring was very high, it seems sufficient for patients to use the medication list and reminders. Interestingly, regimen adherence was significantly higher for patients who set a reminder than those who did not.\nWith the usage of one third of the available time, the application use was already quite good as the patients could use the application according to their own needs. The results also showed that self-care modules, such as the measurement module, are frequently used and that interactive medication reminders positively affect therapy adherence. However, to further improve adherence to the application, one could focus more on the specific needs of patients. For example: Use interactive reminders to enter parameters in the measurement module for patients with AF symptoms or a dysregulated blood pressure; push education when starting medication or undergoing surgery; encourage to set medication reminders with a feedback loop for patients with low adherence."

            "text": "Many questions asked during follow-up were related to the functioning of the application itself. This could indicate that, despite some difficulties, patients want to use the application. Nevertheless, it is also essential to further optimize the App based on these questions. Next, many clinical related questions were asked, requiring the most time to answer. This points to one of the main components of integrated care, i.e. a patient-centered approach with patient involvement and empowerment (25). To do this, patients must be well-educated to interact with their\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 10\nhealthcare providers. This was, in fact, the prime goal of the AFEduApp. Moreover, communication is crucial for patient satisfaction with their care, which was shown by others before (26, 27) and confirmed in our study. The possibility to easily ask questions can comfort patients and reduce emergency department (ED) visits or early consultations, as was shown by Hong KL et al. When looking at the reasons for ED attendance of AF patients in Canada, they noted that 271 of the 356 ED visits were, in fact, unnecessary and could have been managed more effectively outside the ED setting (28). Therefore, accessible communication can help patients explore whether an urgent visit is needed."

However, no difference was seen when patients were asked how they perceived their health status, despite their health remaining the same or having improved. When asked about future follow-up, physician contact remained very important for both groups. However, more patients of the App ITT would also like future follow-up with an application compared to the SC group (P < .001). This was further confirmed when looking at the difference between App-capable patients from the App and SC groups versus patients who are not App-capable: more patients in the latter groups preferred follow-up with a physician or information with a brochure and less with an application.\nSurprisingly, no significant differences were seen for the score on \u201cperceived quality of follow-up in the past year\u201d and evolution of health between the App-capable patients from the App and SC groups. Patients from the App group, who have already had a successful follow-up with an app, appear to be \u201cready\u201d for more digital remote follow-up and fewer doctor visits than patients from the SC App-capable group. This indicates that experience with using an App gives patients confidence in the tool or at least did not demotivate them to use the tool, providing continuous care with targeted education, follow-up of parameters, and an easy way to ask questions if needed. However, the results on AF-EduApp engagement and the similar satisfaction rate between App-capable patients from the App and SC group show that there is still room for improvement of the application to increase app adherence and satisfaction with appdriven follow-up. Also, in the pilot study of one month, usability was positively scored: (i) 17 out of 19 patients found the application easy to use and attractive, (ii) 84.2% wanted to use the App for a longer period, and (iii) 73.1% would participate in further similar projects (13).\nSimilar satisfaction results were seen with other AF apps. For the mAFA trial, 93.9% of the patients found the application easy and user-friendly, 90.8% were positive on real-time communication, and 91.4% thought the application could be helpful for self-care (21). For the Health Buddies app, 9 out of 15 patients indicated they would like to use it again (23).\nfrontiersin.org"
