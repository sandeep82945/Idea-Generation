    "abstractText": "Mutations in subunits of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase cause mitochondrial complex I deficiency, a group of severe neurological diseases that can result in death in infancy. The pathogenesis of complex I deficiency remain poorly understood, and as a result there are currently no available treatments. To better understand the underlying mechanisms, we modelled complex I deficiency in Drosophila using knockdown of the mitochondrial complex I subunit ND-75 (NDUFS1) specifically in neurons. Neuronal complex I deficiency causes locomotor defects, seizures and reduced lifespan. At the cellular level, complex I deficiency does not affect ATP levels but leads to mitochondrial morphology defects, reduced endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contacts and activation of the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (UPR) in neurons. Multi-omic analysis shows that complex I deficiency dramatically perturbs mitochondrial metabolism in the brain. We find that expression of the yeast non-proton translocating NADH dehydrogenase NDI1, which reinstates mitochondrial NADH oxidation but not ATP production, restores levels of several key metabolites in the brain in complex I deficiency. Remarkably, NDI1 expression also reinstates endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contacts, prevents UPR activation and rescues the behavioural and lifespan phenotypes caused by complex I deficiency. Together, these data show that metabolic disruption due to loss of neuronal NADH dehydrogenase activity cause UPR activation and drive pathogenesis in complex I deficiency.",

            "text": "Mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) plays essential roles in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), NADH oxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Mutations in complex I subunits cause complex I deficiency, a clinically heterogenous disorder that frequently results in severe neurological symptoms and death in infancy [1]. Mutations in the complex I genes NDUFS4 and NDUFS1 commonly lead to Leigh syndrome, an aggressive form of complex I deficiency [2]. In mice, knockout of Ndufs4 specifically in the brain recapitulates the severe motor, seizure, neuroinflammatory and lifespan phenotypes associated with Leigh syndrome [3], indicating that symptoms are driven by loss of complex I activity in the nervous system.\nPerturbed mitochondrial function triggers mitochondrial stress signalling pathways. Mitochondrial stress signalling enables mitochondria to communicate with the nucleus and reprogram nuclear gene expression [4\u20136]. Mitochondrial stress signalling can act through different mechanisms, depending on the context. In higher eukaryotes, a common target of mitochondrial stress signalling is activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) [7\u20139]. ATF4 can be activated downstream of the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (UPR), or the integrated stress response (ISR). Importantly, targeting stress signalling pathways, including the UPR and ISR, has shown therapeutic potential in animal models [10,11].\nAnimal models of mitochondrial disease have provided valuable insights into disease mech-\nanisms. Mouse and Drosophila complex I deficiency models have replicated several aspects of the human disease [3,12\u201316]. However, animal models have not previously been exploited to examine mitochondrial stress signalling in complex I deficiency. Here we interrogate a new neuron-specific Drosophilamodel of mitochondrial complex I deficiency. Knockdown of the complex I subunit ND-75 (NDUFS1) in neurons causes neurological phenotypes including climbing and locomotor defects, seizures and greatly reduced lifespan. ND-75 knockdown in neurons does not affect ATP levels but perturbs mitochondrial morphology, causes reduced endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria contacts and triggers the UPR, including activation of ATF4. Loss of ND-75 also alters cellular metabolism and perturbs the TCA cycle. Expression of the single subunit yeast NADH dehydrogenase NDI1 in neurons, which facilitates the TCA cycle, rescues the aberrant mitochondrial morphology and loss of ER-mitochondria contacts resulting from ND-75 knockdown. UPR activation and ATF4 expression are also prevented by NDI1 expression. Moreover, NDI1 almost completely rescues the severe behavioural and\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010793 July 3, 2023 2 / 27\naccession number GSE214562 (https://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc= GSE214562).\nFunding: This work was funded by Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK (ARUK-IRG2017A-2) and the MRC (MR/V013130/1) to JMB; LG was supported by the UK Medical Research Council (MR/N013700/1) and King\u2019s College London MRC Doctoral Training Partnership in Biomedical Sciences; STS and LFA were supported by a Motor Neurone Disease Association (UK) PhD studentship (Sweeney/ Oct15/884-792) and a BBSRC project grant (BB/ M002322/1) to STS; R.P.C was supported by a Northwestern University Pulmonary and Critical Care Department Cugell predoctoral fellowship.

            "text": "Knockdown of ND-75 in Drosophila neurons models mitochondrial complex I deficiency\nMutations in NDUFS1 cause complex I deficiency and Leigh syndrome [2,17]. Complex I initiates the electron transport chain, accepting electrons from NADH which then pass through the complex to ubiquinone. The subunits that form complex I are grouped into 3 modules: N, P and Q. NDUFS1 is an [Fe-S] cluster containing subunit involved in electron transfer that lies within the N module of the complex [18]. To model complex I deficiency in Drosophila we used a previously validated short hairpin RNAi (HMS00853) targeting the Drosophila NDUFS1 homolog ND-75 [19]. We confirmed that ND-75 knockdown (hereafter referred to as ND-75KD) ubiquitously in adult flies using the GeneSwitch system [20] strongly reduced ND-75mRNA expression and caused an ~87% reduction in mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase activity (S1A and S1B Fig). The ND-75 RNAi alone caused a significant reduction in ND75 expression indicating leaking expression of the transgene (S1A Fig). Ubiquitous ND-75KD also significantly reduced the expression of ND-30 (S1C\u2013S1E Fig), the orthologue of mammalian NDUFS3 and a component of Q module of complex I [21], suggesting collapse of the whole complex, and mirroring what has previously been observed with ND-75KD in Drosophilamuscle [21].\nMotor impairments are frequently reported in complex I deficiency patients [22]. Pan-neuronal ND-75KD using nSyb-GAL4 caused late pupal lethality, but dampening GAL4 activity by combining nSyb-GAL4 with Tub-Gal80ts at 25\u02daC resulted in viable adult flies that were almost completely unable to climb (Fig 1A). Similar results were obtained with an independent nonoverlapping ND-75 short hairpin RNAi (HMS00854) (S1H Fig). Although the ND-75 RNAi was leaky and caused reduced ND-75 expression this had no effect on climbing ability, whereas ubiquitous ND-75KD caused a strong reduction in climbing ability (S1A, S1F, and S1G Fig).\nTo further analyse this locomotor phenotype we next measured open-field behaviour in panneuronal ND-75KD flies. The average speed and total distance moved by ND-75KD flies was dramatically reduced, and immobility was increased compared to control flies (Fig 1B\u20131E). Together, these data demonstrate that ND-75KD flies have severe motor dysfunction.\nAlongside motor impairments, seizures are a common symptom of complex I deficiency\n[23,24]. Using a mechanical stress-induced seizure assay we found that pan-neuronal ND75KD flies had a dramatic seizure phenotype, with 94% of flies developing seizures, which were significantly longer than controls and, in some cases, lasting four to five minutes (Fig 1F and 1G). Feeding problems are also common in complex I defiency patients [17] and we found that food intake was significantly reduced in ND-75KD flies (Fig 1H). Together with severe neurological symptoms, complex I deficiency patients typically die within the first few years of life [17,25]. Consistent with this, pan-neuronal ND-75KD flies had dramatically reduced lifespan, with a median survival of five days, compared to 48 days for controls (Fig 1I). Overall, these data show that neuronal-specific loss of ND-75 in Drosophilamodels the severe neurological manifestations of complex I deficiency.\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010793 July 3, 2023 3 / 27\nND-75KD causes reduced neuronal ER-mitochondrial contacts\nMitochondria in fibroblasts isolated from patients with complex I deficiency are fragmented and have significantly altered morphology [26,27]. We therefore investigated the effect of complex I deficiency on mitochondrial morphology in neurons.

At the ultrastructural level, neuronal ND-75KD did not obviously perturb mitochondrial cristae morphology in larval neurons or the adult brain (Figs 2H, 2I, 6G, and 6I).\nTo determine the effect of ND-75 loss on ATP synthesis, we used the Fo\u0308rster resonance\nenergy transfer (FRET)\u2013based ATP biosensor AT-NL [28], which we previously validated [29]. In neurons, as expected, AT-NL produced a significantly higher FRET signal than the AT-RK control probe that does not sense ATP (S2A\u2013S2C Fig). ND-75KD did not alter the\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010793.g002\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010793 July 3, 2023 5 / 27\nAT-NL probe FRET signal in neurons (S2D\u2013S2F Fig), indicating that loss of ND-75 does not affect ATP levels in neurons. Similarly, whole heads from flies with pan-neuronal ND-75KD did not show any change in ATP levels (S2G Fig).\nChanges to mitochondrial morphology lead to alterations in ER-mitochondria contacts\n[30,31]. Depending on the cell-type, it is estimated that ~5\u201335% of the mitochondrial network surface is in close proximity to the ER [32,33]. At sites of contact, mitochondria and the ER physically interact through the formation of tethering complexes [34]. ER-mitochondria contacts play vital roles in processes including Ca2+ homeostasis, mitochondrial fission, autophagy and lipid transfer. In neurons, disturbance of these contacts is strongly associated with altered cellular signalling and disease [35,36]. Therefore, we next assessed whether ER-mitochondria contacts are affected in ND-75KD neurons. To do this, we generated flies expressing the splitGFP-based contact site sensor (SPLICS) [31]. SPLICS consists of an ER membrane-bound moiety and a mitochondrial membrane-bound moiety, which reconstitute to form a functional GFP protein when the ER and mitochondria are close enough (8\u201350 nm) to establish contacts. Mitochondrial morphological changes that alter ER-mitochondrial contacts are detected by SPLICS probes [30,31]. In neuronal cell bodies our SPLICS probe localised to puncta that were significantly reduced by knockdown of the ER-mitochondria tethering protein IP3R [37], validating this tool (S3A\u2013S3C Fig). ND-75KD in larval motor neurons caused a significant reduction in the number of SPLICS puncta (Fig 2E\u20132G), suggesting reduced ER-mitochondria connectivity. We confirmed this finding in the larval nervous system at the ultrastructural level using transmission electron microscopy (Figs 2H\u20132J,). These data suggest that the dramatic alteration in mitochondrial morphology resulting from ND-75 knockdown significantly reduces ER-mitochondria contacts."

            "text": "Disruption of ER-mitochondria contacts has detrimental consequences for ER function, triggering ER stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a stress signalling pathway [38,39]. Furthermore, the UPR contributes to disease progression in animal models of neurodegenerative disease [11]. To investigate whether the UPR is activated in ND-75KD flies, we analysed expression of the UPR transcription factor ATF4. ATF4 is not normally expressed in the Drosophila brain but ND-75KD in neurons caused strong activation of ATF4 expression in the larval CNS and in the adult brain (Fig 3A, 3B, 3E and 3F). Induction of the UPR activates protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), resulting in ATF4 up-regulation through the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 [39]. Consistent with this, ND-75KD increased phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 levels in neurons, and knockdown of PERK abrogated ATF4 activation by ND-75KD (Fig 3C, 3D and 3G\u20132J). Therefore, complex I deficiency activates ATF4 via the UPR in neurons.\nTo independently test the consequences of UPR activation in the nervous system we\nexpressed dominant negative forms of the ER chaperone Hsc70-3 (GRP78, BiP), which ectopically activates the UPR [40]. Pan-neuronal expression of Hsc70-3D231S caused pupal lethality, while expression of Hsc70-3K97S caused a climbing defect (S3D Fig). This finding is consistent with the idea that activation of the UPR contributes to neuronal dysfunction in ND-75KD flies.\nTranscriptional and metabolic disruption in ND-75KD flies\nMitochondrial stress signalling enables mitochondria to reprogramme nuclear gene expression, impacting a wide range of cellular functions [5]. To gain insight into the transcriptional changes induced by mitochondrial complex I deficiency in neurons we performed transcriptomic analysis of head tissue from ND-75KD flies. The expression of 1694 genes were\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010793 July 3, 2023 6 / 27\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010793.g003\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010793 July 3, 2023 7 / 27\nsignificantly increased, and 2017 genes were significantly decreased in ND-75KD flies (S1 and S2 Tables), indicating a strong mitochondrial stress induced transcriptional response. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of genes with increased expression in ND-75KD flies showed significant enrichment of cellular components and molecular functions including transcriptional activity and ubiquitination (S3E and S3F Fig and S3 Table). However, apart from one of the two Drosophila orthologs ofHsp10 (CG9920) whose expression was increased (S1 Table), the expression of genes that respond to the mitochondrial unfolded response (UPRmt;Hsp60C,Hsc70-5 andHsp10; [41]) were unchanged in ND-75KD flies, suggesting that the UPRmt is not activated. By contrast, consistent with activation of the UPR and ATF4 in ND-75KD neurons, 39 of the 230 high confidence Drosophila homologs of mammalian ATF4 target genes had significantly increased expression in ND-75KD flies, including the established ATF4 target protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 15 (PPP1R15), or Gadd34, which mediates dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 (S1 and S5 Tables) [42]. The expression of several autophagy genes (including Atg1, Atg2, Atg5, Atg8a) were also increased in ND-75KD flies, suggesting induction of autophagy and/or mitophagy (S1 Table).\nGO analysis of genes with reduced expression showed striking enrichment for mitochon-\ndrial genes (Fig 4A). Moreover, Kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes (KEGG; [43]) pathway analysis of genes with reduced expression showed genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and the TCA cycle as significantly enriched (Fig 4B). Strikingly, in addition to ND-75, the expression of 28 genes encoding core or accessory subunits of complex I, or complex I assembly factors were significantly decreased in ND-75KD fly head tissue (Fig 4C and S2 Table), while none were significantly increased (S1 Table). Furthermore, expression of multiple subunits of the other four mitochondrial respiratory complexes were significantly decreased by neuronal ND-75KD (Fig 4C and S2 Table). Moreover, the expression of genes encoding numerous antioxidant enzymes were significantly decreased in ND-75KD brain tissue (S2 Table). These data reveal a concerted transcriptional response to depress neuronal mitochondrial respiratory complex gene expression in the brain in response to complex I deficiency.\nGenes encoding TCA cycle enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase, succinyl-CoA synthetase,\nsuccinate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase, malate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase and components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex were significantly decreased in ND-75KD head tissue (Fig 4C and S2 Table), whilst no TCA cycle genes were significantly increased (S1 Table), strongly implying that neuronal mitochondrial metabolism is perturbed by neuronal complex I deficiency. To investigate this further, we performed metabolomic analysis of head tissue to directly analyse the mitochondrial metabolic changes in the brain caused by complex I deficiency (S6 Table). Principle component analysis showed that the metabolite profile in ND-75KD fly heads was markedly different to controls (Fig 4D). Moreover, ND-75KD flies had a significant increase in the level of 22 metabolites, and a significant decrease in the level of 21 metabolites compared to controls (S7 Table). Metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA) showed significant dysregulation of a variety of KEGG pathways in ND-75KD head tissue including purine and amino acid metabolism, the TCA cycle and urea cycle (Fig 4E). Levels of the purine nucleotide adenine were significantly increased, and the TCA cycle intermediate fumarate were significantly decreased in ND-75KD heads (Fig 4F\u20134H and S7 Table). 2-hydroxyglutarate levels were strongly increased (Fig 4F and S7 Table), which we and others have shown is elevated in other mitochondrial dysfunction/disease models [9,44]. Glutamate and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were also increased in ND-75KD fly heads (Fig 4I and S7 Table), indicating that neuronal complex I deficiency affects neurotransmitter levels. Collectively, these data demonstrate that complex I deficiency in neurons disrupts metabolism.\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010793 July 3, 2023 8 / 27\nNDI1 expression partially reverses the neuronal metabolic disruption in ND-75KD flies\nNADH oxidation by complex I replenishes NAD+, an essential coenzyme for the TCA cycle enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase, \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase. TCA cycle intermediates contribute to numerous biosynthetic pathways, including amino acid, fatty acid and purine/pyrimidine synthesis [45,46]. Disruption of the TCA cycle could thus lead to wide-ranging alterations in metabolism in ND-75KD flies. We therefore\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010793.g004\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010793 July 3, 2023 9 / 27\nhypothesised that impaired complex I NADH dehydrogenase activity is a key driver of neuronal dysfunction in ND-75KD flies. To test this hypothesis, we utilised the Saccharomyces cerevisiae single-subunit non-proton translocating NADH dehydrogenase NDI1, which oxidises mitochondrial NADH and transfers electrons to ubiquinone but does not directly contribute to OXPHOS-mediated ATP production [47]. NDI1 expression should therefore restore TCA cycle activity in ND-75KD neurons deficient for complex I activity. We first confirmed that addition of the NDI1 transgene did not alter the strong reduction in ND-75 expression in ND75KD flies with NDI1 expression (S1A Fig). Metabolomic analysis of heads from flies with panneuronal ND-75KD combined with NDI1 expression showed a dramatically altered metabolite profile compared to ND-75KD alone (Fig 4D). Expression of NDI1 reversed the 23 of 45 metabolites whose levels were aberrant in ND-75KD head tissue, including adenine and fumarate (Fig 4F\u20134I and S3 and S4 Tables). Interestingly, NDI1 expression also reversed the dramatic increase in GABA levels in ND-75KD flies (Fig 4F and 4I and S3 and S4 Tables). Thus, expression of NDI1 prevents many of the metabolic changes caused by knockdown of ND-75 in neurons, suggesting that restoration of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase activity broadly benefits neuronal metabolism in complex I deficiency.\nNDI1 expression reinstates ER-mitochondria contacts, rescues neuronal dysfunction and death, and prevents UPR activation caused by complex I deficiency\nAs expected, expression of NDI1 restored the loss of NADH dehydrogenase activity in ND75KD flies (Fig 5A). To test whether impaired NADH dehydrogenase-associated metabolic defects underlie the neuronal dysfunction caused by complex I deficiency, we next analysed the effects of NDI1 expression on motor function, seizure susceptibility and lifespan. NDI1 expression dramatically improved the climbing defect and completely prevented seizures in ND-75KD flies (Fig 5B and 5D). Moreover, ND-75KD flies expressing NDI1 had a median lifespan of 51 days, similar to controls (54 days; Fig 5E).\nComplex I is a major source of ROS and NDI1 has been shown to increase reverse electron\ntransport-mediated ROS production at complex I through the enhancement of reverse electron transport [48]. We analysed ROS using a ratiometric fluorescent probe (mitoroGFP2-Grx1) to measure glutathione redox potential in neurons [49], which we have previously validated [29,50]. ND-75KD in neurons caused a decrease in probe oxidation (S4A, S4B, and S4E Fig), indicating reduced mitochondrial glutathione associated ROS. As expected, expression of NDI1 in neurons alone or in combination with ND-75 knockdown increased mitochondrial glutathione redox potential (S4A-S4E Fig). However, manipulation of ROS levels in ND-75KD flies through knock-down of Sod1, or Sod2, or overexpression of Sod2, catalase, or a mitochondrially targeted catalase, using previously validated transgenes [51], did not modify the climbing phenotype (S4F\u2013S4J Fig). Therefore, although NDI expression elevates ROS levels, the severe behavioural phenotypes in ND-75 KD flies are unlikely to be the result of impaired ROS production.\nFinally, following the observation that NDI1 expression rescues neuronal function in ND-\n75KD neurons, we investigated whether NDI1 expression ameliorates ND-75KD induced changes to mitochondrial morphology, ER-mitochondria contacts and activation of the UPR. Strikingly, we found that NDI1 expression rescued the mitochondrial number and morphology changes (Fig 6A\u20136F), the loss of ER-mitochondria contacts (Fig 6G\u20136K) and prevented ATF4 activation caused by ND-75 knockdown in neurons (Fig 6L\u20136P). Therefore, using NDI1 to at least partially reverse the metabolic disruption caused by ND-75 knockdown prevents UPR activation, neuronal dysfunction and early death in Drosophila.\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010793 July 3, 2023 10 / 27"

Loss of complex I activity in neurons has profound effects on mitochondrial morphology and decreases ER-mitochondria contacts. Consistent with disruption of ER-mitochondria contacts, we find activation of the ER UPR and expression of ATF4 in ND-75KD neurons. ND-75KD causes transcriptional reprogramming, potentially as an attempt to mitigate the loss of complex I activity, repressing complex I and TCA cycle gene expression. There is also evidence of alterations in numerous metabolic pathways, beyond the mitochondrion, as a result of complex I deficiency. Expression of yeast NDI1 in ND-75KD flies reverses key metabolic changes, suggesting that restoring mitochondrial metabolism prevents UPR activation and neuronal dysfunction caused by complex I deficiency.\nA previous DrosophilaND-75 knockdown model used a different ND-75 RNAi line, which results in much weaker phenotypes [13]. Using the same ubiquitous Gal4 driver (Da-Gal4) Hegde et al., found ND-75 knockdown resulted in adult flies with reduced lifespan, whereas\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010793.g006\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010793 July 3, 2023 12 / 27\nwe found that ubiquitous ND-75 knockdown caused developmental lethality. Moreover, Hegde et al., found neuronal specific ND-75 knockdown flies had a 25 day median lifespan, whereas our ND-75KD model has a median lifespan of 5 days. Although we have not directly compared the efficiency of the two RNAi lines, the differences are likely due to the highly efficient knockdown of ND-75 expression in our ND-75KD model.\nATP levels are unaffected by ND-75 knockdown either in individual neurons, or in ND-\n75KD fly whole head tissue. These findings contrast with a previous Drosophilamitochondrial disease model with a mutation in the mitochondrial-DNA-encodedNADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) gene [52]. ND2mutants have reduced ATP levels in heads from 35 day old flies, whereas ATP levels in young flies were not analysed. We analysed ATP levels in very young (2 day old) ND-75KD flies, at which time the brain may have more metabolic plasticity than in old flies. Consistent with this, metabolomic data show significantly increased lactate levels in ND-75KD head tissue (S2H Fig and S6 Table).\nUnderstanding the basis of the neurological manifestations of complex I deficiency in\npatients is hampered by the complex interactions between neurons and glia and the systemic effects of changes to tissues and organs outside the nervous system. Our ND-75KD model provides cell autonomous insight into the effects of neuronal complex I deficiency in vivo. Neuronal ND-75KD causes mitochondrial morphology changes, similar to those caused by knockout of the mitochondrial transcription factor TFAM in dopaminergic neurons [53]. The dramatic reduction in expression of respiratory and TCA cycle genes caused by ND-75KD unbalances the expression of mitochondrial genes encoded by the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. This disruption of inter-organelle gene expression may underlie the mitochondrial morphology defects in ND-75KD neurons. Interestingly, the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis PGC-1\u03b1 is regulated by the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 [54], providing a potential link between the loss of NADH dehydrogenase activity and mitochondrial biogenesis in ND75KD neurons.\nModulation of mitochondrial morphology driven by Drp1 overexpression causes reduced\nER-mitochondria contacts in mammalian cultured cells and primary neurons [30,31]. The reduced ER-mitochondria contacts in ND-75KD neurons are therefore also likely caused by the dramatic mitochondrial morphological changes. ER-mitochondria tethering proteins are involved in regulation of the ER UPR, and modification of ER-mitochondria tethers can trigger UPR activation [55,56]. Together with these studies, our data suggest that ER UPR activation is caused by reduced ER-mitochondrial contacts in ND-75KD neurons. Altered ERmitochondria contacts are a common feature of neurodegenerative disease and there is strong evidence to suggest that they play a pivotal role in disease pathogenesis [56]. Restoring ERmitochondria contacts may therefore also have therapeutic potential in complex I deficiency.\nOur data show that ND-75KD activates ATF4 expression via the ER UPR in neurons. ER UPR activation likely contributes to the neurological defects in ND-75KD flies as ectopic ER UPR activation via expression of dominant negative forms of Hsc70-3 also causes neuronal dysfunction. Activation of the ER UPR and integrated stress response (ISR) are frequently observed in response to mitochondrial dysfunction [4,5,7]. We have previously shown ER UPR and ATF4 activation due to mitochondrial dysfunction in Drosophila neurons using a TFAM overexpression model [9]. Loss of Pink1, Parkin, DJ-1 or OXPHOS inhibition also cause ER UPR or ISR activation [8,36,57,58]. The direct cause of ER UPR and ISR activation in cells with dysfunctional mitochondria is much less well understood. Recently, screening approaches in cultured mammalian cells identified a novel OMA1-DELE1-HRI pathway that activates the ISR in response to mitochondrial dysfunction [59,60]. Whether this pathway is active in neurons is not known but Drosophila do not have an HRI kinase homolog, so this mechanism is unlikely to be relevant to stress signalling in Drosophila.\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010793 July 3, 2023 13 / 27\nNDI1 expression has been shown to extend lifespan and rescue the lethality caused by ubiquitous complex I deficiency in Drosophila [61,62]. Viral expression of NDI1 into the substantia nigra protects against rotenone induced toxicity in a rat model of Parkinson\u2019s disease [63]. In ageing models, NDI1 expression extends lifespan by increasing ROS through over reduction of the ubiquinone pool [48]. In the Ndufs4 knockout mouse model of Leigh syndrome, NDI1 expression rescues the lifespan but not motor defects, potentially through regenerating mitochondrial NAD+ from NADH [16]. ND-75 knockdown in neurons does not affect ATP levels but our metabolic analysis shows that complex I inhibition causes dramatic changes in metabolism, potentially due to aberrant NAD+/NADH inhibiting the TCA cycle leading to broad metabolic alterations. We identified a variety of metabolites whose altered levels in complex I deficiency are reversed by NDI1 expression, including the TCA cycle metabolite fumarate. Increased levels of the major inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA may also contribute to the behavioural phenotypes in ND-75KD flies. Interestingly, glutamate decarboxylase 1 (Gad1) expression is significantly increased by ND-75KD (S1 Table), suggesting that GABA levels may increase in part due to transcriptional mis-regulation. Overall, our study indicates that disruption of metabolism due to loss of NADH dehydrogenase activity is a driver of pathogenesis in the ND-75KD Drosophilamodel. The in-depth knowledge of the mechanisms contributing to neuronal complex I deficiency afforded by the DrosophilaND-75KD model may in future lead to therapeutic strategies tailored to combat the neurological manifestations in mitochondrial disease."

For open-field locomotor activity flies were anaesthetised using CO2 on the day of eclosion, and males of the desired genotype collected. Locomotor assays were performed the following morning, 1\u20134 hours after the start of the 12h light cycle. Flies were briefly anaesthetised on ice and placed into individual openfield arenas 35mm in diameter and 1.8mm in height with vibrating motors attached [66]. Flies were left to acclimatise to the arenas for 15 minutes prior to the start of video recording. Flies were video recorded for a total of 2 hours 15 minutes: after an initial rest period of 30 minutes, flies were subjected to a mechanical stimulus (5 vibrations, 0.2 seconds long, 0.5 seconds apart) followed by 15 minutes recovery. This pattern of stimulus and recovery was repeated a further 5 times before a final rest period of 15 minutes. Tracking of individual flies and analysis of average speed, total distance and immobility was performed using Anymaze software (Stoelting).\nMechanical stress-induced seizure assays were performed using both male and female flies.\nFlies of the desired genotype were collected on the day of eclosion and added to fresh vials so that each vial contained a total of 2 flies. The following day, flies were transferred to an empty vial, and vortexed at full speed for 10 seconds. Immediately after vortexing, flies were observed for seizures. The \u2018bang-sensitive\u2019 seizure phenotype triggered by mechanical stress is well defined [67]. A seizure was defined as a period of paralysis, potentially interspersed with limb twitching, wing movements and abdominal contractions. The length of each seizure was recorded, with the seizure considered to have ended when the fly stood upright. The experimenter was blinded to phenotype until data analysis had been completed.\nLifespan assays were performed using male flies. Male flies of the desired genotype were col-\nlected on the day of eclosion and added to fresh vials. 10 flies were initially added to each vial, and flies were incubated on their sides at 25\u02daC for the duration of the assay. Every 2\u20133 days, flies were flipped into fresh vials and the number of dead flies in each vial were recorded. Dead flies that were carried over into the fresh vials were deducted from the next death count. Any flies that escaped during flipping, or were alive but stuck in the food so could not be flipped, were censored and deducted from the total fly count. Vials were flipped until all residing flies were dead.\nTo measure food intake, the CApillary FEeder assay (CAFE) was performed using 10 male\nand female flies per container for 24 hours as in [68].\nqRT-PCR\nqRT-PCR was performed as described previously [9].

The resulting homogenates next underwent a series of\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010793 July 3, 2023 15 / 27\ncentrifugation steps at 4\u02daC. Firstly, samples were spun at 1000g for 5 minutes. Supernatants were then taken and again spun at 1000g for 5 minutes. Supernatants were taken again and spun at 3000g for 10 minutes. Supernatants were then discarded, and 5ml extraction buffer was added to the remaining pellets. After another round of centrifugation at 3000g for 10 minutes, the supernatants were again discarded, and 5ml extraction buffer containing sucrose, Tris and EGTA only (no BSA), was added to the pellets. Samples were then spun for a final time at 7000g for 10 minutes. Supernatants were removed and pellets (mitochondrial fraction) were resuspended in 500 \u03bcl of extraction buffer without BSA. The concentration of mitochondria in resuspended pellets was determined using a Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\nMitochondrial complex I and citrate synthase activity were assessed using a published pro-\ntocol [69]. To disrupt mitochondrial membranes and maximise enzymatic readouts, isolated mitochondria underwent 3 freeze-thaw cycles prior to use.\nFor measurement of rotenone-sensitive complex I activity, 30\u03bcg/ml isolated mitochondria were added to a cuvette containing 100\u03bcl potassium phosphate buffer (0.5M, 0.5M potassium phosphate monobasic added to 0.5M potassium phosphate dibasic, pH 7.5), 60\u03bcl fatty acidfree BSA (50mg/ml), 30\u03bcl freshly prepared potassium cyanide (10mM) and 10\u03bcl freshly prepared NADH (10mM). A second, identical cuvette was prepared, with the addition of 10\u03bcl rotenone (1mM). Volumes were then adjusted to 994\u03bcl using ddH2O. After mixing, baseline absorbance was read for 2 minutes at 340nm and 25\u02daC using a SPECTROstar Nano (BMG Labtech). After recording of the baseline, 6\u03bcl ubiquinone1 (10 mM) was added to cuvettes, and the change in absorbance (\u0394absorbance) was immediately recorded for 2 minutes at 340nm and 25\u02daC. To calculate the ubiquinone-dependent \u0394absorbance, the baseline \u0394absorbance was subtracted from \u0394absorbance recorded after ubiquinone1 addition. The rotenonesensitive \u0394absorbance for each sample was then calculated by subtracting the \u0394absorbance/ minute with rotenone from the \u0394absorbance/minute without rotenone. Rotenone-sensitive complex I activity was calculated using the following equation: enzyme activity (nmol/min/ mg) = (\u0394absorbance/min \u00d7 1,000)/[(extinction coefficient \u00d7 volume of sample used in ml) \u00d7 (sample protein concentration in mg/ml)], where the extinction co-efficient = 6.2 (NADH), volume = 1 and sample protein concentration = 0.03.\nFor measurement of citrate synthase activity, 5\u03bcg/ml isolated mitochondria were added to a cuvette containing 500\u03bcl Tris (200mM, pH 8.0) with 0.2% Triton X-100, 100\u03bcl freshly prepared 5,5-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DNTB, 1mM) and 30\u03bcl acetyl CoA (10 mM). Volumes were then adjusted to 950\u03bcl using ddH2O. After mixing, baseline absorbance was read for 2 minutes at 412nm at 25\u02daC using a SPECTROstar Nano (BMG Labtech). After recording of the baseline, 50\u03bcl freshly prepared oxaloacetic acid (10mM) was added to the sample, and the change in absorbance was recorded for 3 minutes at 412nm and 25\u02daC. To calculate the oxaloacetic acid-dependent \u0394absorbance, the baseline \u0394absorbance was subtracted from \u0394absorbance recorded after oxaloacetic acid addition. Citrate synthase activity was calculated using the same equation as for determining complex I activity, where the extinction co-efficient = 13.6 (TNB), volume = 1 and sample protein concentration = 0.005."

FDRadjusted p values<0.05 were considered statistically significant. Pairwise MSEA was performed using the \u2018quantitative enrichment analysis (QEA)\u2019 algorithm [77]. The overall metabolite profile (S4 Table) was used as the reference library. FDR-adjusted p-values\ufffd0.05 were considered statistically significant. Using QEA, a p value and a Q statistic, a description of the correlation between compound concentration profiles and clinical outcomes, were generated for each metabolic pathway. The actual Q-statistic calculated for each pathway was divided by the expected Q-statistic to provide the \u2018enrichment ratio\u2019. FDR-adjusted p-values\ufffd0.05 were considered statistically significant."

Briefly, tissues from third instar wandering larvae were dissected and fixed in 0.1 M NaPO4, pH 7.4, 1% glutaraldehyde, and 4% formaldehyde, pH 7.3, overnight. Fixed larval preparations were washed 3\u00d7 in 0.1 M NaPO4 before incubation in OsO4 (1% in 0.1 M NaPO4, 1% potassium ferrocyanide (w/ v) in 0.1 M NaPO4; 2 h), dehydrated in an ethanol series, and embedded using Epon araldite resin. Sections were imaged using a transmission electron microscope (TECNAI 12 G2; FEI) with a camera (Soft Imaging Solutions MegaView; Olympus) and Tecnai user interface v2.1.8 and analySIS v3.2 (Soft Imaging Systems).\nTwo day old dissected adult fly brain samples were post-fixed with 1% (w/v) osmium\ntetroxide and 1% potassium ferrocyanide (w/v) in 0.1M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 hour before being washed and dehydrated through a graded acetone series. Samples were then infiltrated with increasing concentrations of SPURR epoxy resin/acetone mixture before being placed into 100% resin overnight with rotation. The following day, the samples were infiltrated further before embedding (with the dorsal face orientated toward the sectioning plane) and polymerised at 70\u02daC for 24 hours.\nUltrathin sections (50-70nm) were prepared using a Leica UC7 ultramicrotome (Leica\nmicrosystems, Vienna), mounted on grids and contrasted using UranyLess (22409 Electron Microscopy Sciences, USA) and lead citrate (22410 Electron Microscopy Sciences, USA). Samples were examined on a JEOL JEM 1400 Flash (JEOL, Japan) transmission microscope operated at 80 kV and images were acquired with a JEOL Flash Camera.\nMitochondrial contacts were quantified in ImageJ (version 1.52). Mitochondria with ER\ncontacts were identified by observing a 30nm or less distance between the mitochondria and ER. For positive contacts, mitochondria circumferences were measured and recorded. The length of the ER with a distance <30nm was also measured and then divided by the mitochondria circumference to calculate the proportion of the mitochondrial membrane in contact with the ER."
