1. **Investigate the impact of socioeconomic factors on vaccine hesitancy and refusal.** This could help to identify the root causes of vaccine hesitancy and develop targeted interventions to address them.
2. **Examine the relationship between socioeconomic factors and the effectiveness of different vaccine delivery strategies.** This could help to identify the most effective ways to reach and vaccinate underserved populations.
3. **Develop and evaluate interventions to reduce socioeconomic disparities in vaccination rates.** This could include interventions to improve access to vaccines, increase vaccine confidence, and address the underlying social and economic factors that contribute to vaccine hesitancy.
4. **Assess the long-term impact of socioeconomic disparities in vaccination rates on population health.** This could help to quantify the health and economic costs of vaccine inequality and make the case for investing in interventions to reduce disparities.
5. **Explore the role of international cooperation in reducing socioeconomic disparities in vaccination rates.** This could include research on the effectiveness of vaccine sharing programs, the development of new vaccine technologies, and the provision of financial and technical assistance to low- and middle-income countries.
