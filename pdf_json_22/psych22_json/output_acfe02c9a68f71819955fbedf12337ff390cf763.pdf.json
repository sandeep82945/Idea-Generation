Tyssen\nInstitute of Basic Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Department Of Behavioural Medicine, Oslo, Norway *Corresponding author. doi: 10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.88\nPrevious studies have found relatively good physical health in doctors, whereas several studies now report relatively high levels\nof stress and burnout among them. With the exception of higher suicide rates, we have less evidence of poorer mental health among doctors than among other professionals. The elevated suicide rate may represent the tip of an iceberg of frustration and inadequate mental health care among medical doctors. There are very few longitudinal studies that can identify possible risk factors and causality. The Longitudinal Study of Norwegian Medical Students and Doctors (NORDOC) has since 1993/94 followed repeatedly two cohorts of medical students (N=1052) in seven waves during 25 years (Facebook: @docsinrush). Outcomes presented here are on mental health, burnout and problematic drinking. There are two main hypotheses with regard to possible risk factors. First, it may be due to individual factors such as personality traits, past mental health problems etc. Second, contextual stress may influence mental health among doctors, whether this be unhealthy working conditions or negative life events (i.e. stress outside of work). The presentation will give and overview of both individual and workrelated predictors of stress and mental health problems among Norwegian physicians. Individual and organizational interventions to reduce stress and physician burnout will also be dealt with.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.

As with other screeners, prevalence estimation is dependent on the accuracy of the test as well as choice of the cut-off value. The aim of the current study is to use samples from various countries derive more precise prevalence estimates of alcohol problems in physicians by correcting for false positive and false negative results using samples from various countriesMethod: At the Congress of the German Association of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, 2005 in Berlin, 1800 questionnaires, which included the AUDIT-C were distributed among the attending participants. 936 questionnaires (52%) were returned. Also, the data are compared to a second study, performed in Salzburg, Austria to further elucidate the situation. The screening results will be presented and compared to the values when using a correctionformula using data from a general population sample on sensitivity and specificity of the AUDIT-C. Results: Based on the results of AUDIT-C and using a cut-off of 5 for both sexes, 24.1% of the sample of 887 physicians of the German sample are problematic drinkers (14.7% in female and 32 % in male physicians). Using a correction formula leads to markedly lower rates: 6.1% (all), 3.7% (female), 8.1% (male). Discussion: In this large sample, findings clearly confirm that uncorrected screening results lead to severe over-estimation of the prevalence of problematic drinking in\nhttps://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.87 Published online by Cambridge University Press"
