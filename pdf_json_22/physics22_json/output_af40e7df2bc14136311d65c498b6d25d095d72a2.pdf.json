Considering scalar perturbations and the uniform field gauge, we obtain the sound speed of the fields and present a stability analysis by means of the kinetic matrix and the mass eigenvalues. For k-essence models, in the two-field measure theory, the speed of propagation of the field is modified completely due to the new measure field and it gives rise to crucial differences with respect to the case without new measure. The stability analysis gives a physical viable model for the Universe. For the kinetic gravity braiding models in the two-field measure theory we get that, in general, the speed of perturbations is equal to the speed of light which is a consequence of the properties of the new measure field. In the later case, there is always a ghost field. Furthermore, we calculate general expressions for the mass eigenvalues and find, for an explicit example, the existence of tachyonic instabilities.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe discovery of the Universe\u2019s accelerating expansion [1, 2] became one of the most interesting current problems in cosmology [3\u20138]. To explain this behaviour, scientists have proposed many different dark energy models that can be classified into two kinds: the matter and gravity-modified models (see, for example, [9\u201316]).\nA recent alternative explanation to the observations of an accelerating expanding Universe is the Two Field Measure Theory (TMT) [17, 18]. This model includes a new measure, \u03a6, in its action, besides the usual general relativity measure ( \u221a \u2212g). Different actions have been analyzed in this context [19\u201324]. Recently, it has been argued that this kind of formalism is useful in string and brane theories to generate a string tension that appears dynamically [25\u201327]. One of the more interesting properties is that for general k-essence models, this proposal unifies dark matter and dark energy [17, 18]. Moreover, the role of fermionic matter in TMT has also been studied and it was found that its incorporation may lead to a dynamically generated dark energy, for instance, through the neutrino sector [28, 29]. However, to test its viability as an acceptable cosmological model, it is necessary to study the perturbations of these models to see if they evolve according to the observations without developing ghosts or exponential growth. For example, there exist ghost modes in the self-accelerating branch of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati cosmological model [30], in a nonlinear massive gravity [31] and in the linear massive gravity with a de Sitter background spacetime [32]. Several aspects of perturbations in TMT models have been studied in the k-essence context in [17, 33] by a different approach to the presented here.\nSome of the most studied models with the possibility to drive the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe lie in the category of Horndeski\u2019s models [34], which are scalar-tensor theories with second-order equations of motion. From the classification found in [35], we will focus on the first two types of Lagrangians, the k-essence [36\u201346] and the kinetic braiding models [47], which are not excluded by recent observations of gravitational waves [48\u201352]. Other physical preferences could be extracted from the study of the Hubble constant tension in Hordenski\u2019s models which can be found in [53, 54]. The k-essence models are characterized by the action1\nS = \u222b K(\u03d5,X) \u221a \u2212gd4x , (1)\n\u2217Electronic address: rcorderoe@ipn.mx \u2020Electronic address: Josue.desantiago@cinvestav.mx \u2021Electronic address: omr@fis.cinvestav.mx \u00a7Electronic address: mserranoc0800@alumno.ipn.mx 1 This kind of models were proposed initially for inflation [36, 55].\nar X\niv :2\n20 4.\n05 46\n9v 2\n[ gr\n-q c]\n1 3\nO ct\n2 02\n2\nwhere the Lagrangian K is a general function of the k-essence field \u03d5 and its kinetic term X = \u22121/2g\u00b5\u03bd\u2202\u00b5\u03d5\u2202\u03bd\u03d5, where g\u00b5\u03bd is the metric of the spacetime with signature (\u2212+ ++). Later on, it was realized that this model belongs to a wider class of models called Galileons [56\u201359]. In particular, some k-essence models can provide a mechanism to produce a unified description of dark energy and dark matter [44, 45, 60]. The second very interesting subclass of Horndeski\u2019s models is the so-called kinetic gravity braiding models. These models have an action of the form\nS = \u2212 \u222b G3(\u03d5,X) \u03d5 \u221a \u2212gd4x , (2)\nthat includes a D\u2019Alambertian operator and a general function of the field and its kinetic term [47]. 2 In this model, the pressure depends on second-order derivatives of the scalar fields, and the expression for the energy density contains the Hubble parameter. These characteristics produce exciting features analyzed in Refs. [61\u201364].\nIn this paper, we study the cosmological scalar perturbations of k-essence and kinetic gravity braiding models in the context of two field measure theory. To do this we perturb the action following the procedure in [65]. In particular, we obtain propagation speed of the fields, the kinetic matrix and the mass eigenvalues for the kinetic gravity braiding model in TMT. We illustrate our calculations for a particular braiding field.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we develop the main ingredients of TMT. In Section III, we compute the scalar perturbations and the speed of sound of the field for k-essence models and compare them with the case when the TMT is included. In Section IV, we calculate the perturbations of the kinetic gravity braiding model in TMT and the kinetic matrix. In particular, we present the procedure to obtain the mass eigenvalues. Finally, we give our conclusions. Additionally, as a guide to the reader, we include table I with the symbols used in this work.\nII. THE TWO FIELD MEASURE THEORY\nIn this Section we describe the main features of TMT, that we will use throughout this work, following the discussions presented in [22, 66]. In this theory, the action has two measures: the term with the usual metric g\u00b5\u03bd and an extra term with a new measure \u03a6, in the same space-time,\nS = \u222b L1 \u221a \u2212gd4x+ \u222b L2\u03a6d4x. (3)\nIt is possible to construct the new measure using four scalar fields, \u03bea (a = 1, 2, 3, 4),\n\u03a6 = \u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 ijkl\u2202\u00b5\u03be i\u2202\u03bd\u03be j\u2202\u03b1\u03be k\u2202\u03b2\u03be l. (4)\nIn the present work we consider the Lagrangians L1, L2 to be independent from the fields \u03bea and each of them to be independent of each other. The relations between the fields come from the equations of motion.\nAs shown in [67], the variation of the action produces the equation of motion\nA\u00b5i \u2202\u00b5L2 = 0, (5)\n2 The notation G3 for the Lagrangian comes from the classification of the generalized Galileon models [35].\n3 where\nA\u00b5i = \u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 ijkl\u2202\u03bd\u03be j\u2202\u03b1\u03be k\u2202\u03b2\u03be l. (6)\nConsidering the relation\ndet (A\u00b5i ) = 4\u22124\n4! \u03a63 , (7)\nand if we assume \u03a6 6= 0, the constancy of the Lagrangian L2 arises. In the following sections we will assume that the first Lagrangian contains the usual Einstein-Hilbert action plus a matter Lagrangian which will be repeated in the second term. In this work we will consider the matter Lagrangian to be either the k-essence or braiding scalar field, but it can include the other matter-energy components of the Universe:\nL1 = M2p 2 R+ LM (8) L2 = LM , (9)\nwhere MP = 1/ \u221a\n8\u03c0G is the reduced Planck mass (c = ~ = 1). The considerations of this section imply the constancy of LM .\nIII. K-ESSENCE MODEL PERTURBATIONS\nIn this section, we will first derive the cosmological gravitational perturbations for a Universe filled with a purely kinetic k-essence field and calculate its sound speed in the absence of the second measure. For this we will follow De Felice and Tsujikawa [65] who compute the perturbations for a Universe filled with a general Horndeski\u2019s model. We will repeat the procedure for the model including the new measure and compare the results.\nWe start by considering that the action of a k-essence field L1 = M 2 P 2 R+K(\u03d5,X) with L2 = 0:\nS = \u222b d4x \u221a \u2212g [ M2P 2 R + K (\u03d5,X) ] . (10)\nThe flat Friedmann equations associated with this field are given by [36]:\nH2 = 1\n3M2P , (11)\na\u0308 a = \u2212 1 6M2P ( + 3P ) , (12)\nwith\nk = 2XK,X \u2212K , Pk = K . (13)\nWe will work with a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime plus scalar perturbations, that has a metric of the form\nds2 = \u2212 (1 + 2\u03c8) dt2 + 2\u2202i \u03c7 dt dxi + a2Eijdxidxj + a2 (1 + 2\u03c6) dx2 . (14)\nThe selection of a gauge for this metric usually involves choosing two of the perturbations as zero [68]. Here we will use the uniform field gauge where the k-essence field perturbation vanishes (\u03b4\u03d5 = 0) [69] and, to fix the remaining gauge freedom, also set Eij = 0.\nTo obtain the first order equations of motion for the perturbation fields we expand the action (10) up to second order as S \u2248 S(0) + S(1) + S(2). Using the metric (14) as well as the background Friedmann equations we get the expression:\nS (2) = \u222b d4xa3 [( 2\u03c91\u03c6\u0307\u2212 \u03c92\u03c8 ) \u22022\u03c7 a2 + \u03c93 3 \u03c82 + \u03c94 a2 (\u2202\u03c6) 2 \u2212 3\u03c91\u03c6\u03072 (15)\n+ ( 3\u03c92\u03c6\u0307\u2212 2\u03c91 \u22022\u03c6\na2\n) \u03c8 ] ,\n4 where the \u03c9i coefficients are taken from Ref. [65] and we will use them to compare with the TMT case. Here they reduce to\n\u03c91 = \u03c94 = M 2 P, (16) \u03c92 = 2M 2 PH, (17) \u03c93 = 3 2 \u03d5\u03072 ( K,X + \u03d5\u0307 2K,XX ) \u2212 9M2PH2. (18)\nOne can obtain the linear equations of motion for each scalar perturbation by varying the second order action (15) with respect of each of them. In general the expressions can be quite involved, but we can use the procedure in Ref. [70] to obtain the speed of the perturbations directly from the terms in the action. In the following paragraphs we summarize the steps behind this procedure.\nConsidering some of the perturbation fields as Lagrange multipliers we can use their equations of motion and some integrations by parts, to arrive at the second order action in the general form:\nS(2) = \u222b d4x [ AijQ\u0307iQ\u0307j \u2212 Cij (\u2202Qi) (\u2202Qj)\u2212BijQiQ\u0307j \u2212DijQiQj ] , (19)\nwhere Qi are the dynamical perturbation fields of the theory and we are summing over repeated indices. In general, A,B,C and D will be some square matrices dependent only on background quantities. The associated Euler-Lagrange equations become\n2AijQ\u0308j + (2A\u0307ij +Bij \u2212Bji)Q\u0307j \u2212 2Cij\u22022Qj + (2Dij \u2212 B\u0307ij)Qj = 0 . (20)\nIn order to find the sound speed, we are interested in perturbations inside the horizon, with k aH. After Fouriertransforming the fields Qi we keep only the higher terms in \u03c9 and k, arriving at\n(\u03c92Aij \u2212 k2Cij)Q\u0303j(\u03c9, k) = 0 , (21)\nthat can be solved for Qj 6= 0 only if the determinant of the coefficient is zero. Using \u03c9 = csk/a we obtain the condition\ndet ( c2SA\u2212 a2C ) = 0, (22)\nwhich can be used to obtain the speed of propagation of the perturbations in the limit of high frequencies. If c2s is possitive, then the perturbations propagate without growing, if it is zero, the perturbations grow at the rate needed for the structure formation, if it is negative the perturbations grow exponentially.\nComing back to the k-essence field, we can use the equation of motion for \u03c7, \u03c8, \u03c6,\nE\u03c7 \u2192 \u22022(2\u03c91\u03c6\u0307\u2212 \u03c92\u03c8) = 0 , (23)\nE\u03c8 \u2192 2 \u03c93a\n3\n3 \u03c8 + 3\u03c92a\n3\u03c6\u0307\u2212 2\u03c91a\u22022\u03c6\u2212 \u03c92a\u22022\u03c7 = 0 , (24)\nE\u03c6 \u2192 \u2212 d\ndt\n( 2\u03c91a\u2202 2\u03c7\u2212 6\u03c91a3\u03c6\u0307+ 3\u03c92a3\u03c8 ) \u2212 2\u03c94a\u22022\u03c6\u2212 2\u03c91a\u22022\u03c8 = 0 , (25)\nto write the action in the form (19) in terms of a single perturbation field Qi = (\u03c6). The speed of sound c 2 s in this case is given by:\nc2S = 3 ( 2\u03c921\u03c92H \u2212 \u03c922\u03c94 \u2212 2\u03c921\u03c9\u03072 ) \u03c91 (4\u03c91\u03c93 + 9\u03c922) . (26)\nTaking into account that \u2202 k/\u2202X = K,X + 2XK,XX and substituting the values of \u03c91, \u03c92 and \u03c93 we obtained the well known result [36]\nc2S = \u2202P \u2202X \u2202 \u2202X = \u2202P \u2202 . (27)\n5 A. k-essence and the TMT\nIn the remaining of this section we repeat the previous calculation for the k-essence field including the new measure. First we introduce the new measure field as \u03a6 = \u03a60(t) + \u03b4\u03a6(t,x), where \u03a60 is the value of the new measure at the background level and \u03b4\u03a6 is its perturbation. We start again with the corresponding action for the TMT case\nS = \u222b d4x \u221a \u2212g\nM2p 2 R+\n\u222b d4x (\u221a \u2212g + \u03a6 ) K (\u03d5,X) . (28)\nBy writing the field equations at the background level, we arrive at the energy density and pressure of the k-essence field as\n= \u03d5\u03072K,X \u2212K + \u03d5\u03072K,X \u03a60 a3 , (29) P = K. (30)\nThen we expand the action (28) up to second order in the perturbations fields, and use the Friedmann equations with the new energy density and pressure to write\nS (2) = \u222b d4xa3 [( 2\u03c91\u03c6\u0307\u2212 \u03c92\u03c8 ) \u22022\u03c7 a2 + W3 3 \u03c82 + \u03c94 a2 (\u2202\u03c6) 2 \u2212 3\u03c91\u03c6\u03072 (31)\n+ ( 3\u03c92\u03c6\u0307\u2212 2\u03c91 \u22022\u03c6\na2 + W2 a3\n(3\u03a60\u03c6\u2212 \u03b4\u03a6) ) \u03c8 ] ,\nwhere we defined the \u03c9i\u2019s in Eqs. (16),(17),(18) and two new coefficients appear\nW2 = \u03d5\u0307 2K,X , (32)\nW3 = \u03c93 + 3\n2\n( 3\u03d5\u03072K,X + \u03d5\u0307 4K,XX ) \u03a60 a3 .\nWe can vary the action (31) to obtain linear equations of motion for the fields, which can be written as\nE\u03c7 \u2192 \u22022(2\u03c91\u03c6\u0307\u2212 \u03c92\u03c8) = 0, (33) E\u03c8 \u2192 \u2212\u03c92a\u22022\u03c7+ 2\n3 W3a\n3\u03c8 + 3\u03c92a 3\u03c6\u0307\u2212 2\u03c91a\u22022\u03c6+ 3W2\u03a60\u03c6\u2212W2\u03b4\u03a6 = 0, (34)\nE\u03c6 \u2192 \u22122\u03c91a\u0307\u22022\u03c7\u2212 2\u03c91a\u22022\u03c7\u0307\u2212 2\u03c94a\u22022\u03c6+ 6\u03c91a3\u03c6\u0308+ 18\u03c91a3H\u03c6\u0307\u2212 9\u03c92a3H\u03c8 \u2212 3\u03c9\u03072a3\u03c8 \u2212 3\u03c92a3\u03c8\u0307 (35) \u22122\u03c91a\u22022\u03c8 + 3W2\u03a60\u03c8 = 0, E\u03b4\u03a6 \u2192 \u2212W2\u03c8 = 0 . (36)\nFirst we note that the new measure produces a equation of motion E\u03b4\u03a6 that constrains \u03c8 to be zero. In fact this relation can be obtained from the perturbation (in the uniform gauge) of the constancy of L2, since \u03b4L2 = \u2212 12K(\u03d5,X),X\u2202\u03b1\u03d5\u2202\u03b2\u03d5\u03b4g\n\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212K,X \u03d5\u03072\u03c8 = 0. This relation is correctly reproduced considering the perturbation of \u03a6. Instead, if we take the perturbations of the fields \u03bea, we can use the relation \u03b4\u03a6 = 4A\u00b5i \u2202\u00b5\u03b4\u03be\ni, and find that the analogous relation to Eq.(36) is given by \u2202\u00b5 ( K,X \u03d5\u0307 2\u03c8 ) = 0. This last relation implies that K,X \u03d5\u0307 2\u03c8 is a constant, and if we consider it equal to zero we recover the result of Eq. (36). Assuming that \u03c6 can be written as\n\u03c6(x, t) = \u222b \u03c6(k, t)eik\u00b7xd3k, (37)\nthe equation of motion for \u03c7 (33) implies\n\u03c6\u0307(k, t) = 0 , (38)\nor \u03c6(k, t) = \u03c6(k). This is a known solution for the perturbation of a flat FRW Universe dominated by dust as it is the case of Cold Dark Matter (E.g. see Ref. [71]). Here we obtain a similar solution but for a general k-essence model in the presence of a second measure field. It would be interesting to relate this result with the usual Cold Dark Matter\n6 approach. The solution for Cold Dark Matter, however, is obtained in a Newtonian or longitudinal gauge. In order to transform our results to the longitudinal gauge we use a gauge transformation relation (see Ref. [72])\n\u03c6N = \u03c8 +H\u03c7+ a d\ndt (\u03c7 a ) , (39)\n\u03c8N = \u2212\u03c6\u2212H\u03c7 , (40)\nwhere the fields in the right-hand side of the previous equations correspond to the fields used in this work, with solutions \u03c8 = 0 and \u03c6\u0307 = 0. From eq. (35)\nd dt (a\u03c7) + a\u03c6 = 0 . (41)\nThis model can reproduce the background behaviour of a Universe filled with matter plus cosmological constant [17, 22]. In the epoch dominated by matter, the scale factor a \u221d t2/3 leads to a metric perturbation \u03c7 = \u22123\u03c6t/5. Substituting in equations (39) and (40) we arrive at\n\u03c6N = \u2212 3\n5 \u03c6 , (42)\n\u03c8N = \u2212 3\n5 \u03c6 .\nThe Newtonian gravitational potentials (also known as Bardeen potentials) turn out to be constant and equal, as it is expected for a Universe filled with Dark Matter. In the following subsection we explore an alternative route to convince ourselves that the perturbations of this model resemble those of a matter component.\nB. Geodesic perturbations\nAs obtained in section II the equation of motion associated to the new measure implies the constancy of the matter Lagrangian. In this case\nK(\u03d5,X) = constant, (43)\nwhich can be written as follows:\n\u2207\u03b1K = K\u03d5\u03d5,\u03b1 +KX\u2207\u03b1X = 0 . (44)\nWe can rewrite this equation by defining the 4-velocity of the field as\nU\u03b1 \u2261 \u03d5,\u03b1\u221a 2X , (45)\nthen the constancy of the Lagrangian can be written as(\u221a 2XK\u03d5 \u2212KXU\u03b2\u2207\u03b2X ) U\u03b1 \u2212 2XKXU\u03b2\u2207\u03b2U\u03b1 = 0 . (46)\nSince the two terms are linearly independent we arrive at the equations\n\u221a 2XK\u03d5 = KXU\n\u03b2\u2207\u03b2X , (47) U\u03b2\u2207\u03b2U\u03b1 = 0 . (48)\nThe last equation corresponds to the geodesic equation that is satisfied independently of the k-essence Lagrangian. This result was first obtained in Ref. [17] by means of a different approach and it explains that in the procedure of the previous subsection. The fact that the field obeys the geodesic equation allows it to be a good candidate for Dark Matter as it adequately reproduces the formation of structure in the Universe.\n7 IV. KINETIC GRAVITY BRAIDING MODEL PERTURBATIONS\nIn this section, we compute the perturbation equations, the kinetic matrix, the mass eigenvalues and the sound speed for the kinetic gravity braiding models [47] plus the new measure field. We first follow [65] calculations without the new measure in order to illustrate the procedure.\nThe action is given by\nS = \u222b d4x \u221a \u2212g [ RM2P\n2 \u2212 G3 (X,\u03d5) \u03d5\n] . (49)\nAt the background level, the field equations we arrive are the same Friedmann equations than for the k-essence field (11) and (12), where now the energy density and pressure are:\nB = 3\u03d5\u0307 3HG3,X \u2212 \u03d5\u03072G3,\u03d5 , PB = \u2212\u03d5\u03072 (G3,\u03d5 + \u03d5\u0308G3,X) . (50)\nAfter we expand the action up to second order in perturbations, and use the Friedmann equations and some integrations by parts, we obtain the analogous expression as Eq. (15):\nS (2) = \u222b d4xa3 [( 2\u03c91\u03c6\u0307\u2212 \u03c92\u03c8 ) \u22022\u03c7 a2 + \u03c93 3 \u03c82 + \u03c94 a2 (\u2202\u03c6) 2 \u2212 3\u03c91\u03c6\u03072 (51)\n+ ( 3\u03c92\u03c6\u0307\u2212 2\u03c91 \u22022\u03c6\na2\n) \u03c8 ] ,\nwhere the \u03c9i\u2019s introduced in [65] are now:\n\u03c91 = \u03c94 = M 2 P, (52) \u03c92 = \u22122X\u03d5\u0307G3,X + 2M2PH, (53) \u03c93 = 18X 2\u03d5\u0307HG3,XX + 36X\u03d5\u0307HG3,X \u2212 6X2G3,\u03d5X \u2212 6XG3,\u03d5 \u2212 9M2PH2. (54)\nThe equation of motion for \u03c7 (23), will be used again to put the action in the form of (19) and we only have one independent perturbation field \u03c6. We can compute the speed of sound using the expression (22):\nc2S = 3 2\u03c921\u03c92H \u2212 \u03c922\u03c94 \u2212 2\u03c921\u03c9\u03072\n\u03c91 (4\u03c91\u03c93 + 9\u03c922) . (55)\nIf we now turn the attention to the case with TMT, we will arrive at a different and general result. In this case, the action for G3(X,\u03d5) \u03d5 with the new measure included is given by\nS = \u222b d4x\nRM2P 2 \u221a \u2212g \u2212\n\u222b d4x (\u221a \u2212g + \u03a6 ) G3 (X,\u03d5) \u03d5. (56)\nThe energy density and pressure for the Horndeski field \u03d5 become:\n= B\n( 1 +\n\u03a60 a3\n) + 6G3\u03d5\u0307H\n\u03a60 a3 \u2212 \u03d5\u0307G3 \u03a6\u03070 a3 +G3\u03d5\u0308 \u03a60 a3 , (57)\nP = PB\n( 1 +\n\u03a60 a3\n) \u2212 \u03d5\u0307G3\n\u03a6\u03070 a3 \u2212G3\u03d5\u0308 \u03a60 a3 , (58)\nwhere B and PB are the energy density and pressure from the kinetic gravity braiding model (50). After we vary the action (56) up to second order, and simplify it using Friedmann equations and some integration by-parts, the action can be written as:\nS(2) = \u222b d4xa3 [( 2\u03c91\u03c6\u0307\u2212 V2\u03c8 + 3\n\u03a60 a3 \u03d5\u0307G3\u03c6\n) \u22022\u03c7\na2 + V3 3 \u03c82 + \u03c94 a2 (\u2202\u03c6) 2 \u2212 3\u03c91\u03c6\u03072 + F1\u03c62\n+ (\n3V2\u03c6\u0307\u2212 2 \u03c91 a2 \u22022\u03c6+ F2\u03c6\n) \u03c8\n+ \u03d5\u0307G3 ( F3\u03c8 + 3\u03c6\u0307\u2212 \u03c8\u0307 \u2212 \u22022\u03c7\na2\n) \u03b4\u03a6\na3\n] , (59)\n8 where\nV2 = \u03c92 \u2212 ( \u03d5\u03073G3,X + \u03d5\u0307G3 ) \u03a60 a3 ,\nV3 = \u03c93 + ( 9H\u03d5\u0307G3 + 21H\u03d5\u0307 3G3,X + 3\n2 H\u03d5\u03075G3,XX +\n3 2 \u03d5\u0308G3 + 2\u03d5\u0307 2\u03d5\u0308G3,X+\n\u22123 2 \u03d5\u03072G3,\u03d5 \u2212\n3\u03d5\u03072\u03d5\u0308\n2 G3,X \u2212\n\u03d5\u03074\n2 G3,X\u03d5 ) \u03a60 a3 \u2212 \u03d5\u0307 3 2 G3,X \u03a6\u03070 a3 ,\nF1 = 9\n2 \u03d5\u03072 (G3,\u03d5 +G3,X \u03d5\u0308) \u03a60 a3 + 9 2 \u03d5\u0308G3 \u03a60 a3 + 9 2 \u03d5\u0307G3 \u03a6\u03070 a3 ,\nF2 = 3\na3\n( B\u03a60 + 6G3\u03d5\u0307H\u03a60 \u2212 \u03d5\u0307G3\u03a6\u03070 +G3\u03d5\u0308\u03a60 ) ,\nF3 = \u2212 1\n\u03d5\u0307G3\n( 6H\u03d5\u0307G3 + 3H\u03d5\u0307 3G3,X + \u03d5\u0307 2\u03d5\u0308G3,X + 2\u03d5\u0308G3 ) , (60)\nand \u03c9i were defined by Eqs. (52)\u2013(54). To obtain the speed of sound, we cancel the fields \u03c8 and \u03c7 by using their equations of motion, choosing \u03c6 and \u03b4\u03a6 as the dynamical variables. The action can be written in the form (19) with Qi = (\u03c6, \u03b4\u03a6) and A, B, C, D will be 2\u00d7 2 matrices. To this purpose we use the equation of motion for \u03c7 that this time has contributions coming from the new measure:\nE\u03c7 \u2192 \u22122\u03c91\u03c6\u0307+ V2\u03c8 \u2212 3\u03d5\u0307G3 \u03a60 a3 \u03c6+ \u03d5\u0307G3 \u03b4\u03a6 a3 = 0. (61)\nThe equation for \u03b4\u03a6 becomes:\nE\u03b4\u03a6 \u2192 \u03d5\u0307G3F3\u03c8 + 3\u03d5\u0307G3\u03c6\u0307\u2212 \u03d5\u0307G3\u03c8\u0307 \u2212 \u03d5\u0307G3 \u22022\u03c7\na2 = 0. (62)\nFrom the E\u03c7 (61), we can obtain \u03c8 as a function of Q = (\u03c6, \u03b4\u03a6):\n\u03c8 = P1\u03c6\u0307+ P2\u03c6+ P3\u03b4\u03a6, (63)\nwhere\nP1 = 2\u03c91 V2 , P2 = 3\u03d5\u0307G3 V2 \u03a60 a3 , (64) P3 = \u2212 \u03d5\u0307G3 a3V2 .\nUsing E\u03c7 (61) and integrating by parts we can rewrite the action (59) in terms of the perturbation fields \u03c6 and \u03b4\u03a6\nS(2) = \u222b d4x ( a3 [ V3 3 P 21 \u2212 3\u03c91 + 3V2P1 ] \u03c6\u03072 + [\u03d5\u0307G3P1] \u03c6\u0307 \u02d9\u03b4\u03a6 (65)\n\u2212a3 [ \u2212V3\n3 P 22 \u2212 F1 \u2212 F2P2\n] \u03c62 \u2212 [ \u22122a\n3V3 3 P2P3 \u2212 a3F2P3 \u2212 \u03d5\u0307G3F3P2 \u2212 P2 d dt (\u03d5\u0307G3)\n] \u03c6\u03b4\u03a6\n\u2212 [ \u2212a\n3V3 3 P 23 \u2212 \u03d5\u0307G3F3P3 \u2212 P3 d dt (\u03d5\u0307G3)\n] \u03b4\u03a62 \u2212 [ \u2212\u03c94a+ d\ndt (a\u03c91P1)\u2212 2\u03c91aP2\n] (\u2202\u03c6) 2\n\u2212 [\u22122\u03c91aP3] \u2202\u03c6\u2202\u03b4\u03a6\u2212 a3 [ \u22122V3\n3 P1P2 \u2212 3V2P2 \u2212 F2P1\n] \u03c6\u03c6\u0307\n\u2212 [ \u22122a3V3\n3 P1P3 \u2212 3V2P3a3 \u2212 \u03d5\u0307G3F3P1 \u2212 3\u03d5\u0307G3 \u2212 P1\nd dt (\u03d5\u0307G3)\n] \u03b4\u03a6\u03c6\u0307\n\u2212 [\u2212\u03d5\u0307G3P2]\u03c6 \u02d9\u03b4\u03a6\u2212 [\u2212\u03d5\u0307G3P3] \u03b4\u03a6 \u02d9\u03b4\u03a6 ) .\n9 If we define Qi = (\u03c6, \u03b4\u03a6) the previous action takes the form of (19) where the matrices Aij , Bij , Cij , Dij can be easily read (see appendix A). The equation (22) can be used to obtain the sound speed as:\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223c2SA11 \u2212 a2C11 c2SA12 \u2212 a2C12c2SA21 \u2212 a2C21 0\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = 0, (66) and implies that\nc2S = a 2C12 A12 = a2 \u2212\u03c91aP3 \u03d5\u0307G3P1/2 = a2 \u03c91a 1 a3 \u03d5\u0307G3\n\u03d5\u0307G3 2\u03c91 2\n= 1, (67)\nwhich is independent of the model 3. This result arises because the new measure field imposes the constraint of a constant value for the matter Lagrangian. This value for the sound speed makes the kinetic gravity braiding model with new measure unsuitable to represent the Dark Matter of the Universe, as the perturbations will not grow as expected from the structure formations. On the other hand, the field can still be a candidate to the Dark Energy. In order to explore further the existence of problems with the theory, in the following subsection we will investigate its possible ghost or tachyonic instabilities.\nA. Ghost and tachyonic instabilities\nIn this section we study the ghost and tachyon instabilities of the kinetic gravity braiding model when the new measure field \u03a6 is added. To do this we must transform the kinetic term in the perturbed action (65) to the canonical form. First we Fourier transform the action to\nS(2) = \u222b d3kdta3(AijQ\u0307iQ\u0307j \u2212BijQ\u0307iQj \u2212 D\u0303ijQiQj) , (68)\nwere Q = (\u03c6, \u03b4\u03a6) and the expressions for the matrices A, B and D are written in Appendix A. Comparing this action with the general form (19) we see that the Fourier transformation allowed us to merge the two last terms as\nCij(\u2202Qi)(\u2202Qj) +DijQiQj \u2192 ( \u2212k2Cij +Dij ) QiQj , (69)\nwhere we call the term in parentheses D\u0303. The kinetic matrix has the structure\nA = ( A11 A12 A12 0 ) , (70)\nwith eigenvalues\n\u03bb1,2 = 1\n2 (A11 \u00b1\n\u221a A211 + 4A 2 12) . (71)\nFrom this expression we see that \u03bb1 > 0 and \u03bb2 < 0 which implies that one of the resulting fields will have a negative kinetic term and therefore will be a ghost. To see this explicitly we perform the following field redefinition\n\u03c6 = 1\u221a A11 (\u03a81 + \u03a82) ,\n\u03b4\u03a6 = \u2212 \u221a A11 A12 \u03a82 , (72)\nwhich after integration by parts takes the Lagrangian to the form\nL = a 3\n2 [\u03a8\u030721 \u2212 \u03a8\u030722 +K(\u03a8\u03071\u03a82 \u2212 \u03a8\u03072\u03a81)\u2212M11\u03a821 \u2212 2M12\u03a81\u03a82 \u2212M22\u03a822] . (73)\n3 The same result is obtained if we use Qi = (\u03c6, \u03c8) instead of Qi = (\u03c6, \u03b4\u03a6).\n10\nwhere the expressions for the functions K and Mij are written in Appendix A. As expected, one of the resulting fields, in this case \u03a82 has a negative kinetic term and therefore is a ghost [73], with the unwanted property that its energy is unbounded from bellow.\nIn order to check for tachyonic instabilities, we also need to diagonalize the mass term. To keep the kinetic part invariant while transforming the mass term, we propose an hyperbolic rotation instead of the standard rotation [70]\n\u03a81 = cosh\u03b1\u03be1 + sinh\u03b1\u03be2 ,\n\u03a82 = sinh\u03b1\u03be1 + cosh\u03b1\u03be2 , (74)\nwith\ntanh 2\u03b1 = \u2212 2M12 M11 +M22 . (75)\nThe Lagrangian transforms to\nL = a 3\n2 [\u03be\u030721 \u2212 \u03be\u030722 + (K + 2\u03b1\u0307)(\u03be\u03071\u03be2 \u2212 \u03be\u03072\u03be1)\u2212 \u00b521\u03be21 \u2212 \u00b522\u03be22 ] , (76)\nwhere the masses are given by\n\u00b521 = \u03b1\u0307 2 + \u03b1\u0307K +\n1 2 (M11 \u2212M22) + 1 2\n\u221a (M11 +M22)2 \u2212 4M212\n|M11 +M22| M11 +M22 ,\n\u00b522 = \u2212\u03b1\u03072 \u2212 \u03b1\u0307K \u2212 1\n2 (M11 \u2212M22) +\n1\n2\n\u221a (M11 +M22)2 \u2212 4M212\n|M11 +M22| M11 +M22 . (77)\nIn order to have a theory free from tachyonic instabilities both squared masses need to be positive 4. In fact, it is convenient to compare these masses with the Hubble parameter in the case when \u00b52i < 0. For k = 0, we will have strong tachyonic instability if \u2212\u00b52i H2 and the model is unviable. However the model is physically viable if |\u00b52i | \u2264 H2 and the whole stability of the system will be not destroyed by the evolution of this instability in time intervals shorter than the Hubble time [70]. Although the expressions in terms of the original functions in the action (56) are rather involved, we exemplify the application of these conditions in the following subsection in order to shed some light on how they act in a concrete case.\nB. Example\nAs the expressions of the last subsection are too large to give some insight on the tachyonic stability of the Braiding model, here we will apply the stability criteria to a particular example of cosmological interest. We propose a Braiding field which only depends on the kinetic term G3(\u03d5,X) = G3(X). The Lagrangian then becomes invariant under the transformation \u03d5\u2192 \u03d5+const, which leads to a conserved quantity. At the background level we can write this quantity I as:\nI = G3(X)\n[ d\u03a8\ndt \u2212 3h\n( 2X\nG3,X G3 + 1\n) \u03a8 ] , (78)\nwhere we are using5 \u03a8 = a3 + \u03a60. A second conserved quantity arises from the variation of the action (56) with respect to the new measure \u03a6 which produces a constant value for the factor G3(X) \u03d5, at the background level this becomes\nJ = G3(X) (\u03d5\u0308+ 3H\u03d5\u0307) . (79)\nThe energy density and pressure from this field can be written in terms of both conserved quantities, substituting (78) and (79) in the expressions (57) and (58) we obtain\n= J\n( \u03a8 a3 \u2212 1 ) \u2212 I\u03d5\u0307 a3 ,\nP = \u2212J \u03a8 a3\n( 2XG3,X(X)\nG(X) + 1\n) + J \u2212 I\u03d5\u0307\na3 . (80)\n4 The former Lagrangian produces a very simple form of the Hamiltonian which will be unbounded from below if the squared masses are negatives. 5 See section V of Ref. [22] for details.\n11\nAs we are interested in a particular case, we set I = 0 and\nG3 = rX \u03b3 , (81)\nwith \u03b3 and r constants. Equation (78) solves to\n\u03a8 = La3(2\u03b3+1) , (82)\nwith L an integration constant. This solution leads to an energy density and pressure given by\n= JLa6\u03b3 \u2212 J , P = \u2212JL(2\u03b3 + 1)a6\u03b3 + J . (83)\nAn interesting case happens with \u03b3 = \u22121/2 in which the energy density looks like a matter component plus a cosmological constant. Unfortunately this field is not suited to behave as the dark matter at the perturbation level, as its speed of sound (67) equals the speed of light and it is incompatible with the structure formation.\nIn order to study the tachyonic stability of the model we need to compute the expressions in Eq. (77), which depend on the expressions in Appendix A and ultimately are functions of \u03a60 and G3(X). For the first one we have from Eq. (82)\n\u03a60 = \u2212a3 + La3(2\u03b3+1) . (84)\nFor G3(X) we need to solve equation (79) with X = 1/2\u03d5\u0307 2 and for the particular Lagrangian (81) becomes\nJ = r\u03d5\u03072\u03b3\n2\u03b3 (\u03d5\u0308+ 3H\u03d5\u0307) . (85)\nThis equation can be solved to\n\u03d5\u0307 = 1\na3\n( 2\u03b3(2\u03b3 + 1)J\nr\n\u222b a6\u03b3+2\nH da+ C\u0303\n)1/(2\u03b3+1) , (86)\nwhere C\u0303 is an integration constant which can be fixed by given a value to \u03d5\u0307 at an specific time. If we assume that the energy density from (83) is the only component of the Universe, the Friedmann equation becomes\nH2 H20 = \u2126\u03b3a 6\u03b3 + 1\u2212 \u2126\u03b3 . (87)\nThe former integration constants can be written in terms of the free parameters \u2126\u03b3 and \u03b3 as\nJ = 3M2PH 2 0 (\u2126\u03b3 \u2212 1) , L = \u2126\u03b3\n\u2126\u03b3 \u2212 1 . (88)\nWith the above equations we can study the behaviour of the masses (77). Figure 1 gives the evolution of the masses for different values of the density parameter \u2126\u03b3 for the case \u03b3 = \u22121/2. We can see changes in the sign of the squared masses, which correspond to changes in behavior from canonical to tachyonic. For small \u2126\u03b3 the tachyonic behavior occurs only at the early Universe. The change from stable to tachyonic behaviour is very fast in various regions, in particular for \u2126\u03b3 = 0.3 near a = 0.52. Furthermore, there are points where singularities are present, some of them due to a zero value for the A11 term (see Appendix). We have such divergent behavior, for instance, for \u2126\u03b3 = 0.3 and a ' 0.49 in the left panel of Figure 1.\nOne could try a different approach by eliminating the perturbed new measure field \u03b4\u03a6 of the equations of motion for the perturbations and considering instead the independent perturbations as \u03c6 and \u03c8. However, even in this case, the stability behaviour remains. The canonical field has a tachyonic behaviour and the other is free from tachyonic instabilities, but it has a ghost.\nIf the Braiding field were intended to behave as a Dark Matter + Dark Energy, then \u2126\u03b3 \u223c 0.3, but this case present several tachyonic instabilities at different stages in the evolution of the Universe. An extension of our study will need to be performed to see if these instabilities (together with the ghost instability) can be avoided when we consider a Universe filled with baryonic matter and radiation.\n12\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe nature of the late time accelerating expansion of the Universe is one of the most challenging aspects of modern cosmology. One of the more appealing characteristics of Two Field Measure Theory is the possibility to have a unifying description of dark matter and dark energy. In this paper we have studied the perturbations of k-essence and braiding fields in the context of a Two Field Measure Theory. We have found the stability characteristics and the speed of sound of the scalars fields.\nIn the original Horndeski theory, the speed of perturbations is a function of the field LagrangianK(\u03d5,X) orG3(\u03d5,X) as well as their derivatives, as it is summarized in table II, presenting a rich variety in the speeds of sound depending on the particular Lagrangians. When the new measure \u03a6 is added, however, both cases present a fixed behaviour. For the k-essence models we obtained that the field follows geodesics, a result already obtained in [17]. This allows the field to be a good candidate for the Dark Matter as it can grow its perturbations and form the structure of the Universe. In contrast, kinetic gravity braiding model G3 \u03c6 has a unitary speed of perturbations. This characteristic is a consequence of the new measure field which fixed the value of the matter Lagrangian.\nFor the braiding models we studied further their stability conditions. We obtained that, in the presence of the new measure, there will always appear a ghost instability. The field perturbations of the braiding field plus new measure, can be mapped to a two field theory with a ghost field and a canonical field, both with complicated mass expressions written in Eq. (77). When the masses squared are negative we are in the presence of a tachyon instability.\nTo shed some light on the tachyonic stability of the Braiding model, we studied a particular example in which the field density evolves as a power law in the scale factor plus a cosmological constant. In that case, we computed the squared masses of the resulting fields, obtaining that they change their sign as the Universe evolves. When the density of the Braiding model is low, the tachyonic instability can be limited to the early Universe.\nBoth, ghost and tachyonic instabilities disfavour the braiding + TMT model as explanation for either dark energy or dark matter, since its energy is unbounded from below. An equally important problem for the braiding field to represent the dark matter is that its sound speed is equal to the speed of light, this prevents the perturbations to grow and form the structure of the Universe, despite its background density to evolve as dust with 1/a3 as can be seen in Eq. (83) for \u03b3 = \u22121/2. The tachyonic and braiding instabilities might be alleviated if we had considered in our calculations a Universe with more fields besides the braiding field, however this study was outside of the scope of this work.\n13\nThe dark energy nature is one of the most intriguing question in modern cosmology. The TMT theory has exciting properties. For example, any k-essence model in the context of TMT can produce a unification of dark matter and dark energy and explain the growth of structure in the Universe.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was partially supported by SNI-Me\u0301xico and CONACyT research grant: A1-S-23238.

First for the kinetic term AijQ\u0307iQ\u0307j , the matrix Aij has the following components\nA11 = 3M 2 P\n( 4V3M 2 P\n9V 22 + 1\n) ,\nA12 = A21 = \u03d5\u0307G3M\n2 P\na3V2 ,\nA22 = 0 , (A1)\nwhere the factors Vi are defined in equations (60). The second term in the action given by BijQ\u0307iQj has the following components for the matrix Bij :\nB11 = \u2212G3\u03d5\u0307 \u03a60 a3 ( 4M2PV3 V 22 + 9 ) \u2212 2M 2 PF2 V2 , B12 = \u2212 6XG23\u03a60 V2a6 , B21 = 2M2P V2a3 ( \u03d5\u0307G3 [ 2V3 3V2 \u2212 F3 ] \u2212 d dt [\u03d5\u0307G3] ) , B22 = 2XG23 a6V2 . (A2)\nFinally the last term in the action D\u0303ij = \u2212k2Cij +Dij has the following components for the matrix Cij :\nC11 = \u2212 M2P a2 + 1 a3 d dt ( 2aM4P V2 ) \u2212 6M 2 P\u03d5\u0307G3 V2a2 \u03a60 a3 , C12 = C21 = M2P\u03d5\u0307G3 a5V2 , C22 = 0 , (A3)\nand for the matrix Dij :\nD11 = \u2212 3V3\u03d5\u0307 2G23 V 22 \u03a620 a6 \u2212 F1 \u2212 3F2\u03d5\u0307G3 V2 \u03a60 a3\nD12 = D21 = 2V3XG\n2 3\u03a60\nV 22 a 6\n+ F2\u03d5\u0307G3 2V2a3 \u2212 3F3XG 2 3\u03a60 V2a6 \u2212 3\u03d5\u0307G3\u03a60 2V2a6 d dt (\u03d5\u0307G3) ,\nD22 = 2XG23 V2a6\n( F3 \u2212\n2V3 3V2 ) + \u03d5\u0307G3 V2a6 d dt (\u03d5\u0307G3) . (A4)\nThe function K in (73) is written in terms of the matrix components of the original action as:\nK = B12 \u2212B21 2A12 + A\u030711 A11 \u2212 A\u030712 A12 .
