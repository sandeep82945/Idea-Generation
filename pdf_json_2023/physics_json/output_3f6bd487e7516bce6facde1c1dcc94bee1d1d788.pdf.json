Mint1 and Mint2 are highly expressed in the brain and 3 play overlapping roles in the regulation of synaptic vesicle fusion required for neurotransmitter 4 release by interacting with the essential synaptic protein Munc18-1. The mechanism by which Mint1 5 mediates the interaction of Munc18-1 with Syntaxin1a (Sx1a) to control formation of the fusogenic 6 SNARE complex and facilitate neurotransmission remains unclear. Here, we have studied both the 7 specific interactions of the neuronal Mint proteins with Munc18-1 as well as their wider interactome. 8\nUsing biochemical and biophysical binding approaches we identify a short acidic a-helical motif 9 (AHM) within Mint1 and Mint2 that is necessary and sufficient for specific binding to Munc18-1. In 10 silico modelling of this interaction with AlphaFold2 and extensive validation by structure-based 11\nmutagenesis showed that the AHM in Mint forms an a-helical structure that binds a conserved 12 surface on Munc18-1 domain3b. In Munc18-1/2 double knockout cells we show that mutating the 13 Mint-binding site significantly reduces the ability of Munc18-1 re-expression to rescue exocytosis. 14 Although Munc18-1 can interact with Mint and Sx1a proteins simultaneously we find they have 15 mutually reduced affinities, suggesting an allosteric coupling between the two proteins. Using 16 AlphaFold2 we then examined the entire cellular network of putative interactions governed by the 17 Mint scaffolds. Although this suggests many proposed binders do not associate directly with Mints, 18 our analyses provide a structural model for their assembly with a variety of known and novel 19 regulatory and cargo proteins including ARF3/ARF4 small GTPases, and the AP3 clathrin adaptor 20 complex. Validation of Mint1 interaction with a new predicted binder TJAP1 provides experimental 21 support that AlphaFold2 can correctly predict interactions across large-scale datasets. Overall, our 22 data provides insights into the diversity of interactions mediated by the Mint family and shows that 23 Mints may help facilitate a key trigger point in SNARE complex assembly and vesicle fusion. 24\n25\n2\nINTRODUCTION 26 Synaptic vesicle fusion and release of neurotransmitters requires the formation of specific complexes 27 between vesicular and plasma membrane SNARE proteins (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive 28\nfactor attachment receptors). The vesicular v-SNAREs and target t-SNAREs form an a-helical 29\ncoiled-coil assembly that provides the necessary energy to bring the two opposing lipid membranes 30 together for membrane fusion. Munc18-1 (also called Munc18a, syntaxin-binding protein 1 31 (STXBP1), and neuronal Sec1 (nSec1)) is a member of the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) protein family, and 32 an essential regulatory protein required for the assembly of this SNARE complex in neuronal 33 membrane fusion. Munc18-1 binds with high affinity to the target or Qa-SNARE Syntaxin1a (Sx1a) 34 and mediates both its trafficking and its incorporation into the SNARE complex with the Qbc-SNARE 35 SNAP25 and the vesicle or R-SNARE Vamp2. 36 Importantly, Munc18-1 also interacts with other regulatory proteins including Munc13 and the 37 two Munc-interacting protein (Mint) paralogues Mint1 and Mint2. Mints (also known as X11, amyloid 38 precursor protein-binding family A (APBA) or Lin-10 proteins) are multi domain scaffolds that 39 participate in a host of protein-protein interactions. The human genome encodes three Mint 40 homologues, Mint1, Mint2 and Mint3 (Rogelj et al, 2006) (Fig. 1A). Mint1 and Mint2 are highly 41 enriched in brain and spinal cord tissue, while Mint3 is ubiquitously expressed (Biederer et al, 2002; 42 Ho et al, 2002b; Lee et al, 2003; Motodate et al, 2016; Tomita et al, 1999). Structurally, Mint proteins 43 are composed of conserved C-terminal phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) and tandem PSD95/Dlg/ZO-44 1 (PDZ) domains and possess highly extended intrinsically disordered N-terminal domains that 45 mediate paralogue-specific interactions. As scaffold proteins, the PTB domains of the Mint proteins 46 interact with various ligands containing NPxY sequences (x is any amino acid) such as the amyloid 47 precursor protein (APP), APP-like proteins APLP1 and APLP2, and TrkA (Borg et al, 1996; Borg et 48 al, 1998; Caster & Kahn, 2013; Chaufty et al, 2012; Ho et al, 2008; Matos et al, 2012; Saito et al, 49 2011; Sakuma et al, 2009; Sullivan et al, 2014; Tomita et al., 1999; Xie et al, 2013; Zhang et al, 2009; 50 Zhang et al, 1997), while the PDZ domains of the Mint proteins bind to C-terminal PDZ binding motifs 51 (PDZbms) in molecules including NMDA receptors, kalirin-7, neurexins, ApoER2 and LDLR 52 (Biederer & Sudhof, 2000; Gotthardt et al, 2000; Jones et al, 2014; Minami et al, 2010; Motodate et 53 al, 2019). The N-terminus of the Mint proteins contains both conserved and divergent sequences 54 that mediate distinct protein-protein interactions. An N-terminal sequence specific to Mint1 called the 55 CASK-interacting domain (CID) binds specifically to Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine protein 56 kinase (CASK/Lin-2) (a multi domain adapter and kinase) forming a tripartite complex with Veli/Lin-57 7 family proteins and neurexins at the pre-synapse (Borg et al., 1998; Stafford et al, 2011; Tabuchi 58 et al, 2002; Wu et al, 2020; Zhang et al, 2020). In contrast, the N-terminal regions of both neuronally 59 expressed Mint1 and Mint2 proteins specifically interact with Munc18-1 via a sequence termed the 60 Munc18-1-interacting domain (MID) (Biederer & Sudhof, 2000; Graham et al, 2011; Han et al, 2014; 61 Ho et al., 2002b; Okamoto & Sudhof, 1997, 1998; Park et al, 2012). However the mechanism of 62 Munc18-1 interaction is unknown. 63\n3\nThe importance of Mint proteins in neuronal function is apparent in studies showing 64 homozygous deletions of Mint1 or Mint2 display disrupted GABAergic transmission (Ho et al, 2003; 65 Sano et al, 2006), while knockout of both Mint1 and Mint2 neuronal isoforms leads to lethality at birth 66 in most animals, with surviving mice displaying deficits in motor behaviours and spontaneous 67 neurotransmitter release. A prominent phenotype of knockout animals is an alteration in APP 68\ntrafficking and processing to the Alzheimer\u2019s plaque peptide amyloid b (Ab) (Gross et al, 2013; 69 Sullivan et al., 2014), although the changes appear to be dependent on specific knockout conditions 70 with both an increase (Kondo et al, 2010; Saluja et al, 2009; Sano et al., 2006) and decrease (Ho et 71\nal., 2008; Sullivan et al., 2014) in Ab production reported. Thus, the molecular interactions between 72 Mints, synaptic proteins and trafficking partners involved in neurodegenerative diseases is of broad 73 interest to the field. 74 Mutations in the core neuronal pre-synaptic machinery including Munc18-1 and Sx1a lead to 75 a distinct but overlapping set of neurodevelopmental disorders, with symptoms including 76 neurodevelopmental delay, intellectual disability and early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 77 (Lanoue et al, 2019; Verhage & Sorensen, 2020). Mutations in the Mint1-assocated CASK protein 78 have also been found to cause neurodevelopmental disorders with similar features, including mental 79 retardation and microcephaly with ophthalmic atrophy (Hayashi et al, 2017; Hsueh, 2009; LaConte 80 et al, 2019; Piluso et al, 2009), and the human disease linked missense variant p.Leu209Pro in 81 CASK linked to optic nerve hypoplasia specifically disrupts Mint1 binding without impacting other 82 protein interactions (LaConte et al., 2019). Mutations in the Mint proteins themselves have not yet 83 been specifically linked to similar disorders, although copy number variations in Mint2 have been 84 described in patients with epilepsy and intellectual disability (Peycheva et al, 2018). In addition, 85 variants in Mint2 have been linked to autism spectrum disorder, potentially through disruption of 86 neurexin trafficking (Babatz et al, 2009; Lin et al, 2019). By assessing the mechanisms responsible 87 for Mint1 binding to a range of protein partners, we aim to provide a framework that can contribute 88 to the understanding of how Mint1 might modulate a role during neurotransmission and trafficking. 89 In this work we examined the mechanism of binding between the Mint MID domain and 90 Munc18-1. Using truncations and peptide mutagenesis we defined a minimal acidic short linear 91 interaction motif (SLiM) of thirteen amino acids in Mint1 and Mint2 that is required and sufficient for 92 Munc18-1 interaction. Although phosphorylation in this region of Mint1 can regulate binding to other 93 proteins such as APP, this does not appear to influence Munc18-1 affinity. Using AlphaFold2 we 94 generated a model of the Mint1 and Mint2 sequences bound to Munc18-1 which shows that the 95\npeptides form an a-helical structure bound to Munc18-1 at an entirely novel binding site in domain 96\n3b. The binding of this acidic-helical motif (AHM) was extensively validated by mutations in key Mint1 97 and Munc18-1 residues that disrupt their interaction. Notably the AlphaFold2 model and crystal 98 structure match precisely in all key details. Munc18-1 mutation R388A blocking Mint-1 interaction 99 significantly reduced the number of exocytic events detected using VAMP2-pHluorin unquenching 100 in Munc18-1/2 double knockout PC12 cells. Although the respective Mint1/2 and Sx1a binding sites 101\n4\nin domain 3b and domains 1/3a are distinct from each other, their individual Munc18-1 in vitro binding 102 affinities are reduced in the presence of the other ligand. We speculate that this antagonistic 103 allosteric interaction between the two proteins may be important for regulating Munc18-1 templating 104 of SNARE-complex formation. Finally, building on the successful structural predictions of Mint1 with 105 AlphaFold2, we have explored the wider network of interactions mediated by the Mint scaffolds and 106 provide an overall model for its assembly with both effector and regulatory proteins, including the 107 identification of novel binding sites in the Mint PDZ domains for ARF small GTPases and 108 experimental validation of a non-canonical peptide-binding site in the Mint PTB domain that is distinct 109 from the NPxY peptide motif-binding site. 110\n5\nRESULTS 111 Mapping the Munc18-1-binding sequence of Mint1 and Mint2 112 A number of studies have shown that both Mint1 and Mint2 homologues can interact with Munc18-113 1, using methods including immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays (Biederer & Sudhof, 114 2000; Ho et al, 2002a; Lee et al, 2004; M. Okamoto, 1997; Okamoto & Sudhof, 1997). Mint proteins 115 are multi-domain scaffolds with a C-terminal PTB domain and tandem PDZ domains preceded by a 116 long and unfolded N-terminal sequence that shows low sequence homology across the family (Fig. 117 1A; Fig. S1). Munc18-1 binding has been mapped by yeast two-hybrid assays to a region termed 118 the \u2018Munc18-interacting domain\u2019 (MID) within the N-terminus of the neuronal Mint1 and Mint2 119 proteins consisting of residues 226-314 and 185-270 respectively (Okamoto & Sudhof, 1997). We 120 first confirmed the direct interaction of Mint1 with purified Munc18-1, performing a GST pull-down 121 assay using the human Mint1 MID as bait (residues 222-314). This showed clear binding between 122 the two proteins that was specific for the neuronal Munc18-1 protein as we did not detect any 123 interaction with Munc18-3 (Fig. 1B). As the entire N-terminus of Mint1 including the MID is expected 124 to be unstructured in isolation, we hypothesised that Munc18-1 may be binding to a shorter peptide 125 sequence or SLiM (Diella et al, 2008) within the MID. To test this, we generated several truncated 126 Mint1 MID sequences and tested their binding to Munc18-1 by GST pull-down assay (Fig. 1C). This 127 showed that a twenty-one amino acid region encompassing residues 261-282 was required and 128 sufficient for Munc18-1 binding. 129 The binding of a synthetic Mint1 peptide to Munc18-1 was next measured by isothermal 130 titration calorimetry (ITC) and the affinity (Kd) of the interaction was found to be 12.1 \u00b1 1.8 \u00b5M (Fig. 131 2A, Fig. 2B; Table 1). With a direct assay for Mint1(261-282) peptide interaction we generated a 132 series of N and C-terminal deletions and found that the minimal binding sequence for Munc18-1 in 133 human Mint1 consists of the thirteen residues from Glu267 to Ser280 (Fig. 2B; Table 1; Fig. S2). 134 This region is notably the most highly conserved sequence in the N-terminus of Mint1 and Mint2 135 across species (Fig. S1). In line with this we also find that an overlapping peptide from human Mint2 136 shares a similar binding affinity for Munc18-1 (Fig. 2B; Table 1; Fig. S2). Within this region the 137 sequence 267EEDIDQIVAE276 is invariant across Mint1 and Mint2 homologues from human, fish and 138 xenopus species, although it is not present in worms and flies (Fig. S1), and a series of double 139 alanine substitutions in this sequence showed that all these residues are important for Munc18-1 140 interaction by ITC (Fig. 2B; Table 1; Fig. S2). The conservation of this minimal binding sequence 141 suggests that Munc18-1 interactions with Mint1 and Mint2 plays a critical role in the functions of 142 these proteins. 143 We confirmed the binding of Mint1 to endogenous Munc18-1 in PC12 cells by co-144 immunoprecipitation. GFP-Mint1 or GFP-Mint1(D269A/I270A) were expressed in PC12 cells and 145 bound to GFP-nanotrap beads followed by blotting for the presence of Munc18-1 (Fig. 2C). The 146 mutation D269A/I270A reduced Munc18-1 binding in agreement with our in vitro ITC data. 147\n148\n6\nPhosphomimetic Mint1 mutations do not affect the binding to Munc18 149 The N-terminal region of Mint1 and Mint2 is predicted to be unstructured and can be phosphorylated 150 at numerous sites as catalogued in the PhosphoSitePlus database (Hornbeck et al, 2015) (Fig. S3A). 151 There are several potential sites of Ser/Thr phosphorylation adjacent to the minimal Munc18-1 152 binding sequences of Mint1 and Mint2 (Fig. S3B). Given the overall negative electrostatic charge 153 distribution of the Mint1 and Mint2 N-terminal domains (Fig. S3C), we speculated that adding further 154 negative charges in the form of phosphorylation might influence the affinity of the Munc18-1 155 interaction. We designed two longer peptides of Mint1 and Mint2 with putative phosphorylated 156 residues altered to phosphomimetic glutamic acid sidechains and tested their binding by ITC (Fig. 157 2B; Table 1; Fig. S2). Our results suggest that phosphorylation of Mint proteins near to the Munc18-158 interacting sequence does not play a direct role in modulating the Munc18-1 binding affinity at least 159 in vitro. Previous studies showed that Mint1 and Mint2 N-terminal domains can be phosphorylated 160 upstream of the Munc18-1-interacting sequence by the tyrosine kinase c-Src (Dunning et al, 2016). 161 While this enhanced the trafficking of APP via binding the PTB domain, presumably by affecting the 162 overall conformation of Mint1 in some way, it had no effect on Munc18-1 interaction. Phosphorylation 163 of Ser236 and Ser238 in Mint2 also enhance the APP interaction (Sakuma et al., 2009). These sites 164 lie directly adjacent to the Munc18-1-interacting sequence, and our ITC experiments indicate they 165 do not affect Munc18-1 binding (Fig. 2B; Table 1; Fig. S2). Therefore, it appears that while 166 phosphorylation-dependent conformational changes in the Mint1 N-terminal region play a role in the 167 interactions with APP (and likely other PTB domain-binding transmembrane proteins such as APLP1, 168 APLP2, Megalin and LRP) they are dispensable for Munc18-1 association in vitro. 169\n170\nMint1 forms an acidic a-helical motif that binds to Munc18-1 domain 3b 171 Despite attempts to crystallise Munc18-1 bound to various Mint1 peptides we were unable determine 172 a high-resolution structure of this complex, including with stabilized Munc18-1 variants (Peleg et al, 173 2021). The machine-learning structure-prediction algorithm AlphaFold2 (Evans et al, 2022; Jumper 174 et al, 2021) has been successfully used to predict structures of protein-peptide complexes by 175 ourselves and others (Ko & Lee, 2021; Poetz et al, 2021; Simonetti et al, 2021; Tsaban et al, 2021). 176 We therefore performed a series of modelling experiments to map the complex between Munc18-1 177 and Mint1 using the ColabFold implementation of AlphaFold2 (Mirdita et al, 2022). We initially 178 predicted the complex between the Mint1 and Munc18-1 full-length proteins (Fig. S4A). Across 179 multiple models we assessed (i) the prediction confidence measures (pLDDT and interfacial pTM 180 scores), (ii) the plots of the predicted alignment errors (PAE) and (iii) backbone alignments of the 181 final structures. This identified a high-confidence binding sequence in the N-terminal region of Mint1 182 that correlated precisely with the binding motif identified in our biochemical experiments (Fig. S4A). 183 Based on this initial model and our biochemical mapping of the minimal Mint1 sequence for 184 Munc18-1 binding we performed multiple independent predictions using a shorter peptide region, 185 combined with AMBER energy minimization to optimize amino acid stereochemistry. We consistently 186\n7\nfound that the minimal sequence of Mint1 was predicted to form an extended a-helical structure that 187 associated with the Munc18-1 domain 3b (Fig. 3A; Fig. 3B). This novel binding site is highly 188 conserved in Munc18-1 to a similar degree to the binding site for the Sx1a SNARE protein (Fig. 3C). 189 In addition, we found that both the human Munc18-1 and Mint2 proteins and the zebrafish Munc18-190 1 and Mint1 orthologues were consistently predicted to form identical structures (Fig. S4B, S4C). In 191 contrast, the human Munc18-3 protein was not predicted to form a stable complex with Mint1 (Fig. 192 S4D) consistent with their lack of interaction in vitro (Fig. 1B). Finally, we modelled the tripartite 193 interaction of human Munc18-1 and CASK with an extended Mint1 sequence containing both the 194 Munc18 and CASK-interacting domain (CID) (Fig. S4E). The two Mint1 regions were modelled by 195 AlphaFold2 to bind their respective partners in the expected conformations, with the CASK-binding 196 sequence matching closely in structure to the previous crystal structures of the CASK-Mint complex 197 (Wu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). 198\nThe Mint1 interacting sequence forms what we refer to as an acidic a-helical motif (AHM) as 199 proposed by Li and colleagues (Li et al, 2023) (see below), and makes a number of critical contacts 200 with Munc18-1 domain3b including both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between 201 conserved sidechains (Fig. 3D; Movie S1). Consistent with our truncation and mutation analyses of 202 the Mint1 MID peptides (Fig. 2B), all predicted core contacts with Munc18-1 are mediated by Mint1 203 AHM residues Glu262-Ser280. Towards the N-terminus of Mint1 acidic Glu267, Glu268, Asp269 and 204 Glu276 each form complementary bonds with Munc18-1 residues, most notably with Arg388, Tyr411, 205 and Lys415. These are supported by buried hydrophobic interactions of Mint1 Ile270 and Ile273. On 206\nthe opposite side of the Mint1 a-helix C-terminus a network of bonds is formed between Mint1 207 Asp271 and Lys278, with Glu421, Lys425 and His429 of Munc18-1. To confirm the predicted binding 208 site of Mint1 and Mint2 we mutated several residues in domain 3a of Munc18-1 including R388A, 209 L395D, and H429A. In ITC experiments all three mutations showed a reduction in binding affinity 210 and enthalpy, with L395D showing an almost complete loss of association (Fig. 3E). Altogether the 211 Mint1 AHM is predicted to form an extensive complementary interface with Munc18-1, and we 212 speculate that the relatively modest affinity between the two proteins may in part be due to the 213\nentropic cost of the induced a-helical folding of the AHM sequence. 214 To test the functional importance of this interaction for Munc18-1 dependent exocytosis in 215 neurosecretory cells, we performed an exocytic release assay using Munc18-1/2 double knockout 216 (DKO) PC12 cell line in rescue conditions (Kasula et al, 2019). We measured exocytic events by 217 total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy in DKO-PC12 cells co-transfected with 218 VAMP2-pHluorin and either Munc18-1WT-mEos3.2 or Munc18-1R388A-mEos3.2 \u2013 a mutation blocking 219 Mint-1 interaction. VAMP2-pHluorin is classically used to assess vesicular fusion as the intraluminal 220 pH-sensitive pHluorin moiety undergoes unquenching upon exposure to the neutral extracellular 221 environment. This unquenching can be used to study vesicle fusion events and assess the 222 contribution of Munc18-1/Mint1 binding to exocytosis. To assess potential fusion events, we 223 developed a custom Python pipeline that detected puncta of fluorescently labelled vesicles and 224\n8\nassessed them over time. A representative cell shows the initiation and disappearance of several 225 vesicles indicative of fusion events in 3D (time being the 3rd axis) (Fig. S5). We found that the cells 226 expressing the Mint1 binding deficient Munc18-1R388A-mEos3.2 showed a reduced number of 227 exocytic events (Fig. 3F) and yielded an approximate 40% decrease in the number of evoked 228 exocytic events relative to the level found upon re-expression of the wild-type protein (Fig. 3G). 229 As this work was being completed the Song and Feng labs published similar findings 230 regarding the interaction of Munc18-1 with Mint proteins (Li et al., 2023). The crystal structure of rat 231 Mint1(227-303) bound to a complex of Munc18-1 and Sx1a was solved at 3.2 \u00c5 resolution, with 232 electron density observed for Mint1 residues 266-283 associated with Munc18-1 domain 3b. This 233 experimental structure correlates precisely with the region of human Mint1 we have mapped 234 biochemically by truncations and mutagenesis and structurally with AlphaFold2. Based on their 235\ncrystal structure, Li and colleagues termed the Munc18-1-binding Mint1 sequence the acidic a-236 helical motif (AHM) and we have also adopted this terminology. Overlay of the Munc18-1/Mint1 237 crystal structure with our top-ranked AlphaFold2 model shows an essentially identical binding mode 238 in all key details (Fig. 4A), and it is important to note the crystal structure was not included in the 239 AlphaFold2 training set. One minor difference is that the AlphaFold2 predictions consistently model 240 stable electrostatic contacts involving Mint1 Glu267 and Glu268. These are not seen in the crystal 241 structure, and this is likely because these electrostatic interactions are relatively transient and thus 242 not clearly observed in the modest resolution electron density maps. 243 In addition to the crystal structure of Munc18-1/Sx1a bound to the Mint1 AHM, the structure 244 of Munc18-1 was recently determined in a ternary complex with Sx1a and the vesicular R-SNARE 245 VAMP2 (also known as synaptobrevin) by cryoEM (Stepien et al, 2022). Similar to what was 246 observed for yeast SM-family protein Vps33, this showed that Munc18-1 can provide a platform to 247 template the assembly of the Qabc-SNARE/R-SNARE complex required for membrane fusion 248 (Baker et al, 2015). Overlay of the complexes shows that the Mint1 and VAMP2 binding sites do not 249 overlap and thus Mint1 could potentially associate simultaneously with both SNARE proteins (Fig. 250 4B). However, this does not preclude the possibility that protein dynamics or steric effects of the 251 adjacent vesicle and plasma membranes could affect Mint1 interaction. 252\n253 Mint1 binding to Munc18-1 allosterically modulates Sx1a interaction 254 To partly address the question of Munc18-1 dynamics in Mint1 association we examined the effects 255 of domain3a deletions or the presence of Sx1a on their interaction. Previous studies have shown 256 that the flexible hinge-loop region of Munc18-1 domain3a (residues 317-333) is required for efficient 257 priming of secretory vesicles and controls the mobility of Sx1a and subsequent assembly of the 258 SNARE complex (Han et al, 2013; Kasula et al, 2016; Martin et al, 2013). Structural studies of 259 Munc18-1 show that this hinge-loop adopts a \u2018closed\u2019 or inhibitory conformation when Munc18-1 is 260 bound to the Sx1a Habc and SNARE domains (Burkhardt et al, 2008; Burkhardt et al, 2011). Other 261 structures of apo squid Munc18-1, rat Munc18-1 bound to a short Sx1a N-terminal peptide, and the 262\n9\nrecent cryoEM structure of Munc18-1 in ternary complex with Qa-SNARE Sx1a and R-SNARE 263 VAMP2 show that domain3a can also adopt an \u2018open\u2019 conformation that is thought to be necessary 264 for both releasing Sx1a inhibition and providing a platform for binding and assembly of other SNAREs 265 (Bracher et al, 2000; Bracher & Weissenhorn, 2001; Hu et al, 2011; Stepien et al., 2022). This is 266 similar to what is seen when yeast SM protein Vps33 is bound to the Nyv1 SNARE (Baker et al., 267 2015). Surprisingly, we find that deletion of the hinge-loop region in Munc18D317-333, which has only 268 a modest effect on Sx1a binding (Han et al., 2013; Martin et al., 2013), abolishes the binding of Mint1 269 both in GST pull-down and ITC experiments (Fig. 5A, Fig. 5B). 270 As Mint1 binds to Munc18-1 domain 3b, we hypothesized that the perturbed Mint1 interaction 271 on deletion of the distal domain 3a hinge-loop might be due to altered structural dynamics in the 272 combined domain3a/3b module. We therefore tested the binding of Sx1a to Munc18-1 in the absence 273 and presence of the Mint1261-282 peptide to determine if there were any changes in Sx1a affinity due 274 to allosteric interactions. By GST pulldown of GST-Mint1 MID we did not observe a gross impact on 275 the ability to bind Munc18-1 in the presence of the high affinity Sx1a ligand (Fig. 5C). This is in line 276 with the ability to co-crystallise the three proteins when excess Mint1 is present (Li et al., 2023). 277 However, when we quantified the binding affinity by ITC in the presence of Sx1a in complex with 278 Munc18-1 we saw a small but reproducible reduction in the affinity and enthalpy of binding of 279 Mint1261-282 peptide (Fig. 5D; Table 2). In reverse experiments, in the presence of a molar excess of 280 Mint1261-282 peptide we observe a reciprocal reduction in Sx1a binding affinity (Kd) from 7.9 nM to 281 269 nM (Fig. 5E; Table 2). This reduced affinity for Sx1a caused by Mint1-dependent allostery is 282 not seen when we use Mint-binding deficient Munc18D317-333 as expected (Fig. 5F; Table 2). Overall, 283 the data indicates that Sx1a and Mint1 binding to Munc18-1 domains 3a and 3b respectively can 284 allosterically regulate the interaction of the other protein. This has potential implications for a role of 285 Mint proteins in Munc18-1 mediated SNARE assembly, which is a tightly regulated and highly 286 dynamic process. 287\n288 Assessing the network of Mint interactions using AlphaFold2 based predictions 289 Following the successful modelling of the interaction with Munc18-1/2, we next explored the potential 290 of AlphaFold2 to screen for, and map the binding sites of, other protein-protein interactors of the 291 Mint1 and Mint2 neuronal proteins. Putative Mint1 and Mint2 interactors from the BioGRID repository 292 (Oughtred et al, 2021) were screened for direct complex formation with Mint1 and Mint2 respectively 293 using the ColabFold Batch implementation of AlphaFold2 (Mirdita et al., 2022) (Table S1; Table S2). 294 To assign a direct \u2018interactor\u2019 from these in silico analyses, we used an approach similar to recent 295 work by Sifri and colleagues (Sifri et al, 2023). We initially assessed both the AlphaFold2-derived 296 interfacial PTM (iPTM) score and the resultant PAE graphs which provide confidence metrics for the 297 interactions between the proteins. For those with promising scores, we also examined the predicted 298 structures in PyMOL to assess whether interacting regions involved the expected complementary 299 hydrophobic, polar, and electrostatic contacts. To conserve GPU resource allocation, we initially 300\n10\ngenerated only single predictions of each putative complex in AlphaFold2 in unsupervised batch 301 mode. We found that a minimum iPTM score of ~0.3 combined with a strong signal in the PAE plot 302 for inter-molecular structural correlation typically provided a practical indicator of a complex that was 303 suitable for further assessment. In these cases, we subsequently ran at least three modelling 304 experiments focusing on the specific domains of Mint1/Mint2 and the putative interactors that were 305 predicted to interact with each other, to assess whether multiple predictions resulted in physically 306 plausible structures that consistently aligned with each other in PyMOL (Table S1; Table S2). 307 As expected, these in silico interaction screens with AlphaFold2 correctly predicted several 308 well characterized interactors, but they also provided validation of a number of prospective binding 309 partners so far only identified in high-throughput screens (Figure S6; Figure S7; Table S1; Table 310 S2). Known interactors include the cytoplasmic NPxY motif of APP (Matos et al., 2012; Xie et al., 311 2013; Zhang et al., 1997), and the CID sequence of CASK (Wu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) for 312 which crystal structures have previously been determined. In addition, confident predictions were 313 obtained for several other cytoplasmic sequences of transmembrane proteins previously identified 314 to interact with Mint1 and/or Mint2 including lipoprotein receptors LRP1, LRP2 and LRP8 (Gotthardt 315 et al., 2000; He et al, 2007), calsyntenin-1 (CSTN1) (Araki et al, 2003) and KCNJ12 (Leonoudakis 316 et al, 2004). These all utilize variations of the NPxY motif found in APP to associate with the Mint 317 PTB domains (Fig. 6). While LRP1, LRP2 and LRP8 each possess canonical NPxY sequences, 318 CSTN1 and KCNJ12 are predicted to bind the same site of the PTB domain through divergent NPME 319 and NELA sequences respectively. Several other proteins identified in BioGRID were predicted with 320 reasonable confidence to associate directly with Mint1. A putative complex between the homeobox 321 domain of HOXC9 and the PTB domain of Mint1 was modelled by AlphaFold2, via a surface distinct 322 from the NPxY-binding groove. Putative novel interactions between the tandem PDZ domains of 323 Mint1 were also predicted with the USP domain of USP22 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 22) and a C-324 terminal zinc-finger domain from the large protein WIZ (widely interspaced zinc finger-containing 325 protein). 326 We chose four predicted interactions to describe in more detail; (i) the association of the 327 Mint1 and Mint2 PTB domains with a peptide sequence from the coiled-coil protein Tight Junction 328 Associated Protein 1 (TJAP1) also called Protein incorporated later into tight junctions (PILT) or tight 329 junction protein 4 (TJP4)) (Fig 7), (ii) the association of the Mint1 and Mint2 tandem PDZ domains 330 with ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) GTPases ARF3 and ARF4 (Fig. 8A), (iii) the interactions of the 331 C-terminal sequence of the neurexin-1 (NRX1) receptor with the PDZ2 domain of Mint1/Mint2 (Fig. 332 8B), and (iv) lastly the interaction of an N-terminal YxxF motif in Mint1 with the \u00b53 subunit of the AP3 333 clathrin adaptor complex (Fig. 8C). 334 Outside of the canonical interactions of NPxY-related motifs with the Mint1 and Mint2 PTB 335 domains, we observed a high confidence complex prediction involving a short peptide sequence in 336 TJAP1 (an interaction only previously reported in high-throughput proteomic screens (Huttlin et al, 337 2021) (Fig. S7; Table S2). The TJAP1 binding site is distinct from the binding groove of NPxY motifs, 338\n11\nand subsequent predictions of the Mint1 and Mint2 PTB domains in the presence of both the NPxY 339 motif of APP, and the peptide sequence from TJAP1 show highly consistent dual peptide interactions 340 on opposite faces of the PTB domain (Fig. 7A, B). Both the APP and TJAP1-binding surfaces of 341 Mint1 and Mint2 are highly conserved (Fig. 7B). The binding sequence of TJAP1 encompasses N-342 terminal residues 9KPYRKAPPEHRELR22, with buried aliphatic sidechains, and complementary 343 electrostatic and hydrogen-bond contacts as shown in Fig. 7C. The sequence 16PEHR19 is predicted 344 to form a b-turn structure where the Pro16 sidechain forms a stacking interaction with the Arg19 345 guanidino group. To provide further validation of our AlphaFold2 predictions we decided to test the 346 binding of TJAP1 to Mint1 experimentally by ITC. Using the NPxY-containing sequence 347 750SKMQQNGYENPTYKFFEQMQ769 of APP as a positive control we confirmed that this bound to 348 the Mint1 PTB domain with an affinity (Kd) of 0.3 \u00b5M (Fig. 7D; Table 3), similar to the affinity reported 349 previously (Matos et al., 2012). The TJAP1 peptide 9KPYRKAPPEHRELR22 bound to the Mint1 PTB 350 domain with a modest affinity (Kd) of 37 \u00b5M (Fig. 7E; Table 3). Importantly, in competition 351 experiments the presence of the APP peptide did not appreciably alter the TJAP1 affinity nor vice 352 versa, confirming that the two peptides interact with distinct sites on Mint1 as predicted (Fig. 7D and 353 7E; Table 3). These results show the Mint PTB domains are capable of recruiting proteins via two 354 distinct peptide-motifs. 355 Mint2 was previously identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for interactors of ARF3 (Hill et 356 al, 2003). These screens identified fragments of Mint2 containing the tandem C-terminal PDZ 357 domains, and subsequent experiments showed that Mint1, Mint2 and Mint3 could all interact with 358 both ARF3 and ARF4. AlphaFold2 predictions of full-length Mint2 complexed with ARF3 and ARF4 359 revealed a very high confidence interaction of the GTPases with the tandem PDZ domains, 360 correlating with the yeast two-hybrid studies (Hill et al., 2003) (Fig. S7; Table S2). Predictions 361 focused on the Mint1 and Mint2 PDZ domains subsequently produced highly consistent complex 362 structures with the two GTPases (Fig. 8A). The structure of activated ARF3-GTP bound to a bacterial 363 toxin called MARTX was previously solved by X-ray crystallography (Lee et al, 2019). AlphaFold2 364 predicts ARF3 and ARF4 to be in the active GTP-Mg2+-loaded conformation when bound to Mint1, 365 and like the bacterial effector Mint1 and Mint2 primarily engage the switch 2 and interswitch regions 366 of the GTPases, making little contact with the switch 1 region. The ARF GTPases bind an extensive 367 and conserved surface with the interface composed of regions from both PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains 368 in the tandem PDZ structure. 369 Although not listed in the BioGRID entries for Mint1 or Mint2, other studies proposed that 370 their PDZ domains interact with C-terminal sequences of NMDA receptors, kalirin-7, Neurexin-1 371 (NRX1), ApoER2/LRP8 and LDLR (Biederer & Sudhof, 2000; Gotthardt et al., 2000; Jones et al., 372 2014; Minami et al., 2010; Motodate et al., 2019). PDZ domains are small scaffolds that bind to PDZ 373 binding motifs (PDZbms) typically found at the C-terminus of their interacting proteins. They fall in 374\nthree main classes; Type 1 with consensus [S/T]xF (x = any amino acid; F = hydrophobic amino 375\nacid), Type 2 with consensus FxF, and Type 3 with consensus [E/D]xF .(Hung & Sheng, 2002; 376\n12\nNourry et al, 2003). We used AlphaFold2 to predict the interaction of the Mint1 and Mint2 PDZ 377 domains with the C-terminal sequence of NRX1, which conforms to a Type 2 PDZbm. This 378 confidently predicted an interaction between the C-terminal 1471KDKEYYV1477 NRX1 sequence with 379 the second PDZ2 domain of the PDZ1-PDZ2 tandem structure (Fig. 8B). The C-terminal Val1477 380 side chain (position \u20180\u2019 in standard PDZbm nomenclature) docks in a complementary hydrophobic 381 pocket with the terminal carboxyl group hydrogen bonding with the backbone amides of Mint1 382 Leu759 and Gly760. The NRX1 Tyr1475 and Tyr1476 side chains at positions -1 and -2 pack into 383 complementary surface grooves, while both main-chain and side-hydrogen bonds upstream of the 384 C-terminal interaction provide further specificity. This requires experimental validation, but combined 385 with the fact that the C-terminal Mint1 sequence PVYI (PLIY in Mint2) itself can form an 386 intramolecular interaction with its own PDZ1 domain (Long et al, 2005) it suggests that the PDZ2 387 domain of the Mint proteins provides the major platform for recruiting PDZbm-containing ligands. 388\nThe last predicted interaction we examined in detail was that of Mint1 with the \u00b53 subunit of 389 the tetrameric AP3 clathrin adaptor complex (Fig. 8C), another unexpected association reported in 390 the same high-throughput screens as TJAP1 (Huttlin et al., 2021). The \u00b53 subunit has an N-terminal 391\nlongin domain that embeds it within the AP3 tetramer, and a C-terminal \u00b5-homology domain (MHD) 392\nthat associates with YxxF tyrosine-based motifs (where F is a bulky hydrophobic residue), typically 393 in transmembrane cargos for sorting from endosomes to lysosomal compartments (Mardones et al, 394 2013; Sanger et al, 2019). The predicted structure of the Mint1 298YEEI301 sequence closely 395\nresembles the crystal structure of the TGN38 motif YQRL bound to the rat \u00b53 MHD, with both Tyr298 396\nand Ile301 inserting into complementary surface pockets as typically seen for YxxF motifs. We also 397\ntested AlphaFold2 predictions of the Mint1 sequence with other \u00b5-subunits from AP1, AP2, AP4 and 398\nAP5. While \u00b51, \u00b52 and \u00b54 proteins were each predicted to interact, the iPTM confidence scores were 399 much lower, and AP5 was not predicted to bind at all. 400 While we have focused on proteins that are predicted to bind to Mint1/Mint2, it is notable that 401 from the list of putative BioGRID interactors the majority are not predicted to associate directly with 402 the Mint adaptors, including many that have previously been identified using methods such as co-403 immunoprecipitations (Table S1; Table S2). In some case this could be due to limitations with the 404 predictive ability of AlphaFold2. However, it likely indicates that many of the proteins reported in 405 BioGRID either bind indirectly (via other proteins not included in our binary predictions) or are non-406 specific interactions detected by the proteomics methods. 407\n13\nDISCUSSION 408 The interaction of Munc18-1 with Mint proteins has long been known to be important for synaptic 409 neurotransmitter and hormonal release through the regulation of SNARE-mediated vesicle fusion. 410 While the molecular basis for the scaffolding and trafficking of the APP transmembrane protein and 411 CASK kinase have been structurally characterised (Matos et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2020; Xie et al., 412 2013; Zhang et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 2020), the mechanism by which Mint bind to Munc18-1 was 413 unknown. In this work, and in a recent study by Li and colleagues (Li et al., 2023), the interaction is 414\nrevealed to be via the binding of Munc18-1 domain3b via a conserved a-helical motif (AHM) in the 415 N-terminal unstructured domains of the Mint1 and Mint2 neuronal homologues. The binding surface 416 on Munc18-1 is distinct from its known binding sites for the Sx1a and VAMP2 SNARE proteins, 417 although we find there is a small but significant reduction in the binding affinity of Sx1a in the 418 presence of the Mint1 AHM. In line with a role for the Mint1 interaction in Munc18-1-dependent 419 exocytosis we observed that perturbation of Munc18-1 Mint-1 interaction in domain 3b impacted 420 exocytosis in neurosecretory cells. We speculate this could point to a role of Mint proteins in 421 regulating the SNARE complex dynamic templating activity of Munc18-1 which will be worth future 422 investigation. 423 The AHM sequence found in Mint1 and Mint2 is conserved across many species, although it 424 appears not to be present in some organisms such as nematodes and flies. Further, it may be 425 relatively specific to the Mint proteins, with few if any other proteins possessing similar motifs. We 426 scanned the human genome using ScanProsite and did not find any other proteins with highly similar 427 sequences. Li and colleagues reported potential AHMs in Munc13-1, Bassoon, and Atg16L, although 428 no binding was detected using the putative motif from Munc13-1 by ITC (Li et al., 2023). Future 429 proteomic studies of Munc18-1 using specific domain3b mutations may reveal the existence of other 430 proteins able to bind this site, but there are unlikely to be a large number. Like the CASK-binding 431 CID sequence in Mint1, the Mint1 and Mint2 AHM sequences lie within their extended and 432\nintrinsically unstructured N-terminal domain, likely adopting their a-helical structures via induced 433 folding upon Munc18-1 interaction. This may explain the relatively modest binding affinity for 434 Munc18-1 despite the reasonably large binding surface. The interaction between these proteins is 435 thus likely highly context dependent, relying on both their specific coupling as well as their 436 colocalization at the membrane surface and likely clustering with other proteins such as the SNAREs, 437 APP, neurexins, and potentially small GTPases like ARF3. 438 In addition to dissecting the mechanism of Mint1 and Mint2 interaction with Munc18-1, we 439 have used machine learning-based structure prediction with AlphaFold2 to assess the broader 440 interactome of the Mint proteins. These predictions provide useful insights into those interactions 441 that are likely to be directly mediated by the Mint proteins, as validated at least in one instance with 442 the direct binding of TJAP1 confirmed. Our results thus provide an example of how AlphaFold2 (and 443 similar algorithms) can be used to provide confidence in the plausibility of complexes identified in 444 larger proteomic datasets (Burke et al, 2023; Gao et al, 2022a; Gao et al, 2022b; Humphreys et al, 445\n14\n2021; Sifri et al., 2023; Yu et al, 2023). Such an approach has the potential to inform and accelerate 446 subsequent experimental validation of molecular complexes detected in high-throughput screens, 447 by providing much greater confidence as to which hits represent specific interactions. 448 Apart from the expected predictions of CASK and APP, for which previous crystal structures 449 are available, there were several other notable complexes that were confidently modelled by 450 AlphaFold2 in this study. A number of proteins have been reported to interact with the PDZ domains 451 of Mint1 and Mint2 via C-terminal PDZbms, including calcium channels (Maximov et al, 1999), kalirin-452 7 (Jones et al., 2014; Penzes, 2001), NMDA receptors (Motodate et al., 2019) and NRX1 (Biederer 453 & Sudhof, 2000; Dean & Dresbach, 2006). Furthermore, the C-terminus of Mint proteins can form 454 an intramolecular interaction with the PDZ1 domain, effectively acting as an autoinhibitory sequence 455 of PDZ1 (Long et al., 2005). Taking NRX1 as an example, we found that its Type II PDZbm was 456\npredicted to interact with the PDZ2 domain in the canonical b-strand orientation, and since other 457 neurexin homologues share the same C-terminal sequence they likely use the same binding 458 mechanism. This hypothesis, as well as whether the second PDZ2 domain is bound by other 459 PDZbms warrants further investigation. 460 One novel Mint interactor predicted by AlphaFold2 and validated in direct binding 461 experiments was TJAP1, which was previously identified in high-throughput proteomic screens with 462 all three Mint homologues (Huttlin et al., 2021). TJAP1 has an N-terminal unstructured region, which 463 we predicted to interact with Mint PTB domains, a central-coil region predicted by AlphaFold2 to form 464 a homodimer (not shown), and an extended C-terminal unstructured and Proline-rich domain. The 465 precise function of TJAP1 is essentially unknown, although it was identified in yeast two-hybrid 466 assays to bind the GTPase ARF6 (Tamaki et al, 2012) and discs large-2 (Dlg-2/PSD93) (Kawabe et 467 al, 2001), a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein family that 468 includes CASK (Ye et al, 2018). TJAP1 is localised to both the Golgi and tight junctions (Kawabe et 469 al., 2001; Tamaki et al., 2012), and the putative interaction with the TJAP1 N-terminal peptide 470 sequence is confidently predicted with not only the neuronal Mint1 and Mint2 proteins but also the 471 ubiquitous Mint3 protein (not shown) so it is possible that the association is important in cell types 472 other than neurons. 473 Similar to TJAP1, the ARF3 and ARF4 small GTPases were originally identified to bind Mint 474 proteins in yeast two-hybrid screens (Hill et al., 2003), however no subsequent studies have 475 examined the mechanism or functional role of these interactions. Our modelling indicates a 476 conserved binding site involving the PDZ1 and PDZ2 tandem domains of the Mint proteins, which 477 support the original yeast two-hybrid mapping experiments. ARF3 is highly enriched in the brain, 478 and both proteins play a role in maintaining recycling endosome morphology and integrity (Kondo et 479 al, 2012; Nakai et al, 2013). Interestingly ARF3 mutations have recently been found in patients with 480 neurodevelopmental disorders characterised by brain abnormalities, microcephaly and seizures 481 (Fasano et al, 2022; Sakamoto et al, 2021). It is tempting to speculate these disorders overlap with 482 synaptic pathologies caused by mutations in Munc18-1, CASK and other synaptic proteins, thus 483\n15\nsuggesting a role for ARF3 in the synaptic vesicle trafficking pathways that could in part be mediated 484 through the Mint proteins. 485 The last predicted interaction we examined was that of Mint1 with the AP3 clathrin adaptor 486\ncomplex. This involves binding of the AP3 \u00b53A domain with a canonical YxxF sequence in the Mint1 487\nN-terminal region (not present in Mint2 or Mint3). It would indicate that the Mint1 N-terminus has at 488 least two functions distinct from the other Mint isoforms; the ability to bind CASK, and the potential 489 to couple Mint1 and bound proteins (such as APP or neurexins for example) into AP3 mediated 490 transport structures. AP3 is primarily found on endosomes where it mediates trafficking to lysosomes 491 and lysosome-related organelles (Sanger et al., 2019), and depending on specific subunit isoforms 492 has important roles in axonal transport and synaptic function by regulating the reformation of synaptic 493 vesicles from endosomes derived from bulk synaptic endocytosis (Blumstein et al, 2001; Evstratova 494 et al, 2014; Li et al, 2016; Newell-Litwa et al, 2010; Seong et al, 2005; Shetty et al, 2013; Voglmaier 495 et al, 2006). Similar to ARF3, mutations in neuronal AP3 isoforms can lead to neurodevelopmental 496 disorders with some similar features to synaptopathies (Lanoue et al., 2019), suggesting a potential 497 functional overlap of Mint1 and AP3 in synaptic integrity (Ammann et al, 2016; Assoum et al, 2016). 498 An overall model for Mint1 is shown in Fig. 9 summarising the known and predicted 499 interactions mediated by this scaffold protein. Fig. 9A shows an AlphaFold2 prediction of the full-500 length protein highlighting binding sequences and structural domains of the protein and underlines 501 the highly extended nature of the N-terminal intrinsically disordered domain containing the Munc18-502 1 binding AHM as well as binding motifs for the AP3 adaptor and CASK. Fig. 9B is a cartoon 503 summary of the interactions described above and highlights the overall scaffolding function of this 504 protein. From our biophysical and biochemical studies, we speculate that the reduced affinity of Sx1a 505 for Munc18-1 in the presence of the Mint AHM sequence could lead to an enhancement of SNARE 506 assembly mediated by Munc18-1 templating, although this will require further validation. A final 507 caveat to this model is that it does not account for temporal regulation of the various interactions, 508 the impact of posttranslational modifications or the cellular context where each interaction is likely to 509 occur including the plasma membrane and other organelles such as endosomes and the Golgi. 510 In summary, we have mapped and characterised the specific association of the neuronal 511 Mint1 and Mint2 proteins with the SNARE regulatory protein Munc18-1 providing a high-resolution 512 snapshot for how these key synaptic proteins interact with other, confirming and extending recent 513 related work (Li et al., 2023). This study further emphasises the ability of AlphaFold2, at least in 514 many instances, to predict protein-peptide interactions with a high degree of accuracy. By applying 515 a wider set of systematic analyses, our work has revealed likely modes of interaction between the 516 Mint proteins and a variety of known and novel effectors, which provides a foundation for future 517 mechanistic studies of their important role in synaptic activity. 518\n519\n16\nMETHODS 520 Antibodies, plasmids and peptides 521 Human Mint1 sequences for bacterial expression were codon optimised and sub-cloned into the 522 pGEX4T-2 plasmid by Genscript (USA). The constructs generated were GST-tagged Mint1(226-523 314)(MID), Mint1(261-272), Mint1(261-282), Mint1(226-289), Mint1(222-314), Mint1(237-289). 524 Human Mint1 open reading frame and mutant Mint1(D269A/I270A) were obtained from Genscript 525 and cloned into the pcDNA3.1-N-eGFP. The human Mint1 PTB domain (residues 448-623) 526 sequence was synthesised and cloned into pGEX6P-2 by Gene Universal. 527 All Mint-derived synthetic peptides were purchased from Genscript (USA). The human 528 APP(750-769) (SKMQQNGYENPTYKFFEQMQ) and TJAP1(9-22) (KPYRKAPPEHRELR) peptides 529 were made by solid phase peptide synthesis in-house, purified by reverse phase HPLC and purity 530 assessed by mass spectrometry. GFP polyclonal antibody and Goat anti-mouse secondary antibody 531 were purchased from Thermo Fisher and Mouse monoclonal anti-munc18-1 was purchased from 532 BD biosciences. pmEos3.2-N1 Munc18-1WT was created by restriction digestion of Munc18-1WT 533 (double digestion with NheI/AgeI, New England Biosciences) from pmEos2-N1 Munc18-1WT (Kasula 534 et al. 2015 Journal of Cell Biology), vector linearisation of pmEos3.2-N1 with NheI/AgeI was followed 535 by T4 Ligation. pmEos3.2-N1 Munc18-1WT was then used as a template to introduce the following 536 missense mutation R388A using Quick-Change Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent 537 Technologies, Cat# 210518) as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Primers were designed by PrimerX 538 (site: http://bioinformatics.org/primerx/) and ordered from SigmaAldrich.

All new plasmids were 541 verified by sanger sequencing performed by the Australian Genome Resource Facility (Brisbane, 542 Australia). pCI VAMP2-pHluorin was a kind gift from James Rothman (Miesenbock et al, 1998). 543\n544 Recombinant protein expression and purification 545 All proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta\u2122(DE3) cells. GST-Mint1 (226-314, the 546 Munc18-1 interacting domain (MID)), containing pGEX4T-2 vector was transformed into Rosetta 547 cells and plated on a LB/Agar plate supplemented with Ampicillin (0.1mg/mL). Single colony was 548 then used to inoculate 50 mL of LB medium containing Ampicillin (0.1 mg/mL). and the culture was 549 grown overnight at 37 oC with shaking at 180 rpm. The following day, 1L of LB medium containing 550 antibiotics Ampicillin (0.1 mg/mL) and Chloramphenicol (0.034 mg/mL) was inoculated using 10 mL 551 of the overnight culture. Cells were then grown at 37 oC with shaking at 180 rpm to an optical density 552\nof 0.7-0.8 at 600 nm and the protein expression was induced by adding 0.5 mM IPTG (isopropyl-b-553\nD-thiogalactopyranoside). Expression cultures were incubated at 20 oC overnight. And the cells were 554 harvested next day by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 min using Beckman rotor JLA 8.100. Cell 555 pellets were resuspended in 20 mL (for cell pellet from 1L) of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 500 556 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, Benzamidine (0.1mg/mL), and Dnase (0.1 mg/mL)). 557\n17\nResuspended cells were further lysed by using the cell disrupter (Constant systems, LTD, UK , TS-558 Series) and the soluble fraction containing GST-Mint1 was separated from cell debris by 559 centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 oC. The soluble fraction was first purified by affinity 560\nchromatography using glutathione-Sepharose resin and the GST-Mint1 was eluted using 50 mM Tris, 561 pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT buffer and the protein containing fractions were 562 concentrated and further purified by gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 75 (16/600), GE 563 Healthcare). GST-Mint1 containing fractions were analysed by SDS PAGE. All the other GST-Mint1 564 N-terminal constructs (GST-Mint1 261-272, 261-282, 226-289, 222-314, 237-289) were also 565 expressed and purified as described above. The GST-Mint1 PTB domain was expressed as above, 566 but the GST tag was removed by incubation with Prescission protease, followed by gel filtration into 567 50 mM HEPES, 200 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP and 5% glycerol. 568 For GFP-nanotrap preparation, the plasmid pOPINE harbouring His-SUMO-GFP-nanotrap 569 was transformed into Escherichia coli Bl21 (DE3) cells and plated on a LB/Agar plate supplemented 570 with Ampicillin. GFP-nanotrap refers to the camelid-derived nanobody specific for GFP (Kubala et 571 al, 2010). The expression and lysis of cells were carried out as described above. The supernatant 572 containing GFP nano trap was first purified by affinity chromatography using Talon resin equilibrated 573 with 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 10 % Glycerol and protein bound to the column was eluted 574 using elution buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 10 % Glycerol, 300 mM Imidazole. 575 The fractions containing GFP-nanotrap was combined, concentrated and loaded on to a Superdex 576 75 (16/60) column equilibrated with 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP (tris(2-577 carboxyethyl)phosphine). The fractions containing the protein were analysed by SDS PAGE, 578 combined, and concentrated to the desired concentration. Rat Sx1a (Sx11-261-His), Munc18-1-His 579 and Munc18-1D317-333 were also expressed and purified to homogeneity as described Hu et al (Hu et 580 al., 2011). 581\n582 Cell culture and Transfection: 583 Neurosecretory cell line, Pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) and Munc18-1/ 2 double knockout PC12 584 cells (DKO-PC12) (Kasula et al., 2019), were cultured at 37 oC/5% CO2 in normal culture media 585 (Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (High glucose, pyruvate, Gibco, Cat#11995), 7.2% Heat-586 inactivated Foetal Bovine Serum (Gibco), 7.2% Heat-inactivated Horse Serum (Gibco), 1x 587 GlutaMAXTM supplement (Gibco, Cat# 35050061)). Cells were transfected using LipofectamineTM 588 LTX (Invitrogen, Cat#15338100) as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For co-IP experiments PC12 589 cells 4 x 106 cells were cultured in 10 cm culture dishes (TPP Techno Plastic Products AG) coated 590 with 0.1 mg/mL Poly-D-Lysine (Sigma, P2636). For each condition 15.3 \ud835\udf07g plasmid DNA was used 591 per 10 cm dish and 2x 10 cm dishes were pooled for experiments. PC12 cells were transfected with 592 either pEGFP-N1 (GFP Control), pcDNA3.1-N-eGFP hMint1 WT or pcDNA3.1-N-eGFP hMint1 593 DI/AA mutant, and 48hr post transfected cell pellets were collected for subsequent co-IP/GFP Trap. 594\n18\nMunc18 DKO-PC12 cells were co-transfected with 1 \u03bcg pCI VAMP2-pHluorin and 1 \u03bcg of either 595 pmEos3.2-N1 Munc18-1WT or pmEos3.2-N1 Munc18-1 R388A with 6.75 \u03bcL LipofectamineTM LTX 596 with PLUS ReagentTM (ThermoFisher, Cat# 15338-100) into 3.5 cm petri dishes as per the 597 manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cells were re-plated after 24 h onto 0.1 mg/mL Poly-D-Lysine 598 (SigmaAldrich, Cat#P2636-100MG) coated glass-bottom petri-dishes (Cellvis, Cat# D29-20-1.5-N) 599 and imaged 48 hrs after transfection. 600\n601 Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) 602 PC12 cells containing EGFP, GFP- hMint1 (WT), GFP hMint1 DI/AA were lysed on ice using buffer 603 composed of 20 mM Hepes, 50 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, 1 mM DTT, DNAse and a tablet of protease 604 inhibitor cocktail. To further enhance the Lysis, the lysate was aspirated through a small needle 605 approximately 10 times. The lysate was then centrifuged at 17,000 g for 15 minutes to separate the 606 cellular debris from the supernatant containing the soluble proteins. 50 \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc59 of GFP nano trap coupled 607 to NHS activated Sepharose 4 beads were added to each of the three supernatants containing GFP, 608 GFP-hMint1 WT and GFP-hMint1 DI/AA. The supernatant-bead mixtures were incubated for 2 hours 609 at 4 \u00b0C while shaking, and then the beads were spun down by at 5000 g for 2 minutes to remove the 610 unbound proteins. The bead samples were washed three times using the lysis buffer, and 50 \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc59 of 611 SDS sample buffer was added to each sample. The beads, containing the immunoprecipitated 612 proteins were boiled at 95 \u00b0C for 5 minutes to elute the bound proteins and resolved using Western 613 immunoblotting. GFP and Munc18a proteins were detected using anti-GFP mouse and anti-614 Munc18a mouse as primary antibodies respectively and Goat anti-mouse antibody as the secondary 615 antibody. The final imaging was performed using ECL and Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-616 COR). 617\n618 Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM) and cell footprint analysis 619 For live cell TIRF imaging, transfected Munc18 DKO-PC12 cells were imaged in glass-bottom dishes 620 bathed in Buffer A (145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM Na2HPO4, 10 mM D-glucose, 20 mM HEPES, 621 pH 7.4) and imaged immediately before and following 2 mM BaCl2 addition, to elicit vesicle fusion 622 (Papadopulos et al, 2013). Dishes were imaged on an iLas2 Microscope (Roper Scientific) equipped 623 with a Nikon CFI Apo TIRF 100\u00d7/1.49 NA oil-immersion objective, and an Evolve 512 Delta EMCCD 624 camera (Photometrics) and Metamorph Imaging Software version 7.7.8. Cells were imaged at 10 Hz 625 (100 ms acquisition), for 3000 frames (300 seconds) at 37oC/5% CO2, and 30% of the initial 491 626 laser power in TIRF. 627\n628 Vesicle Fusion Assays in Munc18 DKO cells 629 To assess vesicle fluorescence over time a custom Python 3.8 pipeline was developed. For a typical 630 3000 frame TIRF acquisition, the data was read into a Python z-stack and divided into 100 frame 631 intervals. The fluorescence at each interval was averaged, and fluorescent puncta identified at pixel 632\n19\nresolution (where 1 pixel = 106 nm) using the Laplacian of Gaussian functionality of Python OpenCV. 633 The puncta were used to populate a 3D [x,y,t] array. 3D DBSCAN (scikit-learn) was used to identify 634 clusters of puncta which were within 1 pixel spatially and 2 pixels temporally. The time corresponding 635 to the disappearance of each cluster was used as the indicator of a completed fusion event. Ongoing 636 clusters that had not disappeared by the end of the acquisition were not considered for further 637 analysis. 638\n639 Statistical Analysis of vesicle fusion events in Munc18 DKO cells 640 Unless otherwise stated, values are represented as mean\u00b1SEM. The tests used for statistical 641 analysis are indicated in the respective figure legends. Non-parametric Mann Whitney U test was 642 used to compare two groups of for non-normally distributed data. Comparisons of the same cells 643 analysed before and after stimulation was analysed by a paired statistical test. Data were considered 644 significant at P < 0.05. 645\n646 Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) 647 For ITC, all peptides were weighed and initially dissolved in the working buffer to make a stock 648 concentration of 2 mM. ITC experiments measuring Munc18-1 binding to Mint1 peptides and Sx1a 649 were carried out on Microcal iTC200 at 25oC. GST-Mint1 and all the other proteins used in the 650 experiments were buffer exchanged into 50 mM Tris, (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl by gel filtration prior to 651 ITC. GST-Mint1 (1 mM), Sx1a (1 mM) or Mint1 synthetic peptide (0.7 mM) were titrated into Munc18-652\n1-His (50 \u00b5M). Mint1 PTB domain binding to the APP and TJAP1 peptides was performed in 50 mM 653 HEPES, 200 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP and 5% glycerol at 25oC with 1 mM peptides titrated into 50 654\n\u00b5M Mint1 PTB domain. The binding parameters, equilibrium constant Ka (1/Kd), stoichiometry (n) 655 and the enthalpy (DH) were determined by processing the ITC data using ORIGIN 7.0 software. The 656\nequation, DG = DH \u2013 TDS was used to calculate the Gibbs free energy (DG) and all the experiments 657\nwere performed in triplicate to calculate the standard error of the mean (SEM) for thermodynamic 658 parameters. 659\n660 Pull down assays 661 Pull down assays were carried out using GST-Mint1 and Munc18-1-His. 0.5 nmol of GST-Mint1 was 662\nmixed with 1 nmol of Munc18-1-His in 500 \u00b5L of pull down buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 663 1mM DTT, 0.1% IGEPAL) and incubated for 30 min on a rotating holder at 4 oC. The protein mixture 664\nwas then centrifuged at full speed for 5 min and 50 \u00b5L of glutathione Sepharose resin pre-equilibrated 665\nin pull down buffer was added. The protein mix with the resin was incubated further 30 min at 4 oC 666 on a rotating holder and at the end of the incubation, the beads were spun down at 5000 rpm for 30 667 sec. The supernatant containing the unbound protein is pipetted off and the beads with the bound 668\nprotein was washed 4 times with 1 mL of pull down buffer. 50 \u00b5L of SDS sample buffer was added 669 to the beads and analysed by SDS-PAGE for bound proteins. 670\n20\n671 Protein structural prediction, modelling and visualisation 672 All protein models were generated using AlphaFold2 Multimer (Evans et al., 2022; Jumper et al., 673 2021) implemented in the Colabfold interface available on the Google Colab platform (Mirdita et al., 674 2022). For each modelling experiment ColabFold was executed using default settings where multiple 675 sequence alignments were generated with MMseqs2 (Mirdita et al, 2019). For all final models 676 displayed in this manuscript, structural relaxation of peptide geometry was performed with AMBER 677 (Hornak et al, 2006). For all modelling experiments, we assessed (i) the prediction confidence 678 measures (pLDDT and interfacial iPTM scores), (ii) the plots of the predicted alignment errors (PAE) 679 and (iii) backbone alignments of the final structures. For modelling of the complex between Munc18-680 1 and Mint1 we initially predicted the complex between full-length proteins and identified a high-681 confidence binding sequence in the N-terminal region of Mint1 that correlated precisely with the 682 binding motif identified in our biochemical experiments. Based on this initial model and our 683 biochemical mapping of the minimal Mint1 sequence for Munc18-1 binding we performed multiple 684 independent predictions using a shorter peptide region, combined with AMBER energy minimization 685 to optimize amino acid stereochemistry. 686 For interactome-wide analysis of other protein-protein interactors of Mint1 and Mint2 we 687 obtained a list of putative interactors from the BioGRID repository (Oughtred et al., 2021), and 688 predicted whether they formed direct complexes using the ColabFold Batch implementation of 689 AlphaFold2 (Mirdita et al., 2022) (Table S1; Table S2). To assign a direct \u2018interactor\u2019 from these in 690 silico analyses we used an approach similar to recent work by Sifri and colleagues (Sifri et al., 2023). 691 We initially assessed both the AlphaFold2-derived interfacial PTM (iPTM) score and the resultant 692 PAE graphs which provide confidence metrics for the interactions between the proteins. For those 693 with promising scores we also examined the predicted structures in PyMOL to assess whether 694 interacting regions involved the expected complementary hydrophobic, polar, and electrostatic 695 contacts. To conserve GPU resource allocation, we initially generated only single predictions of each 696 putative complex in AlphaFold2 in unsupervised batch mode. We found that a minimum iPTM score 697 of ~0.3 combined with a strong signal in the PAE plot for inter-molecular structural correlation 698 typically provided a useful indicator of a complex that was suitable for further assessment. In these 699 cases, we subsequently ran at least three modelling experiments focusing on the specific domains 700 of Mint1/Mint2 and the putative interactors that were predicted to interact with each other, to assess 701 whether multiple predictions resulted in physically plausible structures that consistently aligned with 702 each other in PyMOL (Table S1; Table S2). Sequence conservation across PDB models was 703 mapped with Consurf (Ashkenazy et al, 2016). All structural images were made with Pymol 704 (Schrodinger, USA; https://pymol.org/2/). 705\n706\n21\nAcknowledgements 707 This work was supported by grants from the National Health and Medical Research Council of 708 Australia (NHMRC) (APP1138083 and APP1139316) to B.M.C and FAM.

(C) Endogenous 1076 Munc18-1 is bound to GFP-tagged Mint1 but not the mutant GFP-Mint1D269A/I270A. GFP-tagged Mint1 1077 proteins were transiently transfected into PC12 cells, immunoprecipitated with GFP-nanobody 1078 coupled beads, and the bound proteins probed by Western blot with anti-Munc18-1. 1079\n1080\nFigure 3. Modelling of Munc18-1 in complex with the Mint1 AHM sequence. 1081 (A) AlphaFold2 prediction of the complex between Munc18-1 and Mint1 AHM. The three top ranked 1082 models are overlaid and shown in backbone ribbon representation. The AHM is consistently 1083\nmodelled in an a-helical structure associated with the Munc18-1 domain3b (highlighted in blue). On 1084 the right the predicted alignment error (PAE) is plotted for each model. Signals in the off-diagonal 1085 regions indicate strong structural correlations between residues in the peptide with the Munc18-1 1086 protein. Fig. S4 shows predictions of the full-length Munc18-1 and Mint1 complex as well as models 1087 of other Munc and Mint homologues and orthologues.

Comparison of the predicted Munc18-1/Mint1 complex with experimental structures. 1100 (A) Overlay of the Munc18-1 complex with Mint1 AHM predicted by AlphaFold2 and the recent crystal 1101 structure of the Munc18-1/Sx1a/Mint1 complex (Li et al., 2023). The inset shows details of the 1102 binding site modelled by AlphaFold2 and observed in the crystal structure. The two structures are 1103 identical in all key respects. (B) Overlay of the Munc18-1 complex with Mint1 AHM predicted by 1104 AlphaFold2 and the cryoEM structure of the Munc18-1/Sx1a/VAMP2 complex (Stepien et al., 2022). 1105 The Mint1 AHM is expected to bind Munc18-1 independently of the Sxa1 t-SNARE and VAMP2 v-1106 SNARE proteins. 1107\n1108\nFigure 5. Mint1 and Sx1a show allosteric effects on binding to Munc18-1 1109 (A) Pulldowns with GST-Mint1 MID show that Munc18-1 domain3a hinge loop is important for binding. 1110 As Mint1 does not contact domain3a this suggests an allosteric effect on the domain3b binding site. 1111 Image shows Coomassie stained gel. (B) ITC of synthetic Mint1261-282 peptide binding to purified 1112 Munc18-1 (red) and Munc18-1D317-333 (black) confirm the requirement of domain3a for Mint1 1113 interaction. (C) Pulldowns with GST-Mint1 MID show that Mint1 can bind Munc18-1 both alone and 1114 in the presence of Sx1a. Image shows Coomassie stained gel. (D) Although Mint1 and Sx1a can 1115 bind Munc18 simultaneously, ITC of Mint1 Mint1261-282 AHM peptide binding to Munc18-1 in the 1116 absence (red) and presence (black) of Sx1a shows a reduction in binding affinity and enthalpy. (E) 1117 ITC of Sx1a binding to Munc18-1 in the absence (black) and presence (red) of synthetic Mint1261-282 1118 peptide. Together this shows there is a subtle allosteric inhibition of Sxa1 binding to Munc18-1 in the 1119 presence of Mint1.

Mint1 structural model and interactions. 1161 (A) Structural model of Mint1 derived from AlphaFold2 (Ammann et al., 2016). (B) Schematic 1162 summary of Mint1-mediated interactions, and speculative model suggesting that at the cell surface 1163 Mint1 may act to reduce the affinity of Munc18-1 for the auto-inhibited Sx1a, thus enhancing the 1164 ability of Sx1a to associate with VAMP2 and SNAP25 to form the trans-SNARE assembly required 1165 for vesicle fusion. The C-terminal domains of Mint1 in contrast are associated with other proteins 1166 containing NPxY and PDZbm sequences and ARF small GTPases that may enhance Mint1 1167 membrane recruitment and modulate transmembrane protein trafficking. 1168\n1169\n33\nSupplementary Information 1170 Figure S1.

(Related to Fig. 3) 1194 (A) Overlaid top three ranked models of human Mint1 bound to Munc18-1 from ColabFold shown in 1195 backbone ribbon representation. Mint1 is consistently modelled to bind Munc18-1 domain 3b via a 1196\nshort acidic a-helical motif (AHM) within its unstructured N-terminal domain (highlighted in blue). On 1197\nthe right hand side the predicted alignment error (PAE) is plotted for each model. Signals in the off-1198 diagonal regions indicate strong structural correlations between residues in the peptide with the 1199 Munc18-1 protein. (B) Overlaid top three ranked models of the zebrafish Mint1 AHM sequence 1200 bound to Munc18-1 predicted with ColabFold. Similar to the human structures, the AHM is 1201\nconsistently modelled in an a-helical structure associated with the Munc18-1 domain3b (highlighted 1202 in blue). (C) Overlaid top three ranked models of the human Mint2 AHM sequence bound to Munc18-1203 1 predicted with ColabFold. (D) Overlaid top three ranked models of the human Mint1 AHM 1204 sequence modelled with the non-binding Munc18-3 homologue. The AHM is modelled at several 1205 random positions (highlighted in blue). The PAE plots do not show evidence of significant interactions 1206 between the two proteins. (E) The top scoring model of the human Mint1 AHM and CID sequences 1207\n34\nbound to Munc18-1 and CASK using ColabFold. The AHM region is predicted in an identical binding 1208 site on Munc18-1 to the isolated peptide sequence (highlighted in blue). The CID sequence is 1209 predicted to bind to CASK in almost essentially the same conformation as the two previous crystal 1210 structures (Wu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). 1211\n1212 Figure S5.
