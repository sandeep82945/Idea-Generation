    "abstractText": "A growing interest for demonstrating prestige and status of higher education institutions has spurred the establishment of several international ranking systems. A major percentage of these rankings include parameters related to scientific productivity. Here, we examined the differences between diverse rankings as well as correlation with bibliometric parameters and disciplines for the top universities. We investigated the top 300 universities from four international rankings, the Times Higher Education World University Ranking (THE), the QS World University Rankings (QS) the ShanghaiRanking-Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) and the U.S.News Best Global Universities Ranking (USNews). The assessed parameters include ranking positions, size related and bibliometrics-related indicators of each selected ranking. The weight of scientometric parameters ranges between 20% (QS) and 75% (USNews). The most important parameters defining ranking positions include citations, international reputation, and the number of researchers, but the correlation strength varies among ranking systems. The absolute number of publications and citations are particularly important in ARWU and USNews rankings, and scientific category normalized (field weighted) citation impact is central in THE and USNews rankings. Our results confirm that universities having outstanding results in rankings using size-independent indicators (QS and THE) compared to others have significantly lower number of students. High impact research can improve position in ARWU and USNews ranking lists. Regarding to different disciplines, the main results show that outstanding universities in THE ranking have higher publication activity in social sciences and universities which perform better in USNews and QS ranking have more publications in science, technology, and medicine fields and lower score in social sciences. In brief, here we present a comprehensive analysis of the correlation between scientometric parameters and university ranking positions, as well as the performance of outstanding universities and their correlation with different disciplines, to help decision makers select parameters for strengthening and to attract the interest of prospective students and their parents via a better understanding of the functions of different ranks.",

In the case of universities, there are several metrics enabling qualitative assessment, including the oversubscribed proportion of the admissions, the admission score, the proportion of international students, the ratio of students to lecturers, the number of lecturers with PhDs, etc. In this field, before the publication of university rankings, the reputation of the university was the decisive argument for the choice.

On the other hand, it is not so easy for a university with a history of hundreds of years to lose it either. According to several authors, a university\u2019s reputation is a decisive factor that increases the number of international students2.\nAs early as 1863, a research was published with the purpose to compare and analyze the German polytechnic schools\u2014Hanover, Karlsruhe, and Zurich\u2014for the upcoming reorganization of the Technical College in Prague3. Hundred years later, in 1986, the US News and Report US Colleges Ranking was published, which was the first national level comparison of universities. The first truly global international university ranking, the Shanghai Jiao Tong University\u2019s Academic Ranking of World Universities, was published in 2003. Since then, more and more university rankings have appeared, some of which have a long history and became recognized, while some others have lost attention over time.\nThe purpose of university rankings is to compare universities based on their merit and performance. There are as many methodologies as there are rankings, and their data collection can be based on data submitted by universities and data extracted from other sources and databases. Using these data, ranking systems aim to provide a common definition of value4. The range of indicators used is wide, there are metrics that depend on or are independent of the size of the university, and there are rankings where the reputation of the university is part of the method, which is assessed with the help of questionnaires. Despite their different methodologies, there are reasonable similarities between the rankings5, and a common feature of rankings is the use of bibliometric indicators.\nStudies have been conducted to assess the effect of university rankings on the selection preferences of prospective students. A study mapped Chinese students\u2019 knowledge of university rankings using a survey of more than 900 students and found that thirty percent of the students was aware of ranking positions6. On the other hand, progress achieved in ranking lists had little or no effect on the students\u2019 choice of university2. According to others, the university rankings had an impact on the choice of university and among the indicators of the rankings, students consider those universities that refer to mentoring, faculty infrastructure, and general satisfaction of students as the most important aspects, while the characteristics that are aimed at research are less relevant to them7. Other studies have also shown that prospective students and their parents rely on university rankings when making decisions about higher education8. Based on data from a medium-sized German university, the university\u2019s place in the rankings had high importance for both international and national students, similarly to other determinants of reputation and quality9. A study using Google trends and QS World University Rankings found positive and significant relationship between QS ranking results and Google Search volumes for universities in the top 50010. Nevertheless, international students are mostly concentrated at large universities11.\nFor the determination of scientific output, a new branch of science, scientometrics, has emerged, the purpose of which is to provide an objective, qualitative picture of research output with the help of mostly quantitative indicators. The analysis of scientometric performance, an easily quantifiable output, is a key feature in each ranking. The aim of our study was to investigate the possible correlations between different scientometric variables and the results achieved by a university in each ranking and to find the common scientometric and discipline characteristics of universities that have achieved outstanding results in one ranking compared to other rankings. We also aimed to compare the importance of different parameters when determining ranking outcome. It\u2019s important to emphasize that universities should avoid prioritizing rankings as their only objective. Instead, their focus should include enhancing teaching quality, advancing scientific research, and elevating the standard of their services. In this aspect, ranking is one of the tools at hand for monitoring relative output."

            "text": "Setting up a matched ranking for top universities. The ranking presented by the Times Higher Education (THE) magazine performs its own data collection for the included universities. It had common roots with QS ranking between 2004\u20132009, but in 2010 it switched to a different methodology. THE is based on 13 performance indicators grouped into five areas: teaching (30%), research (30%), citations (30%), knowledge transfer (2.5%), and international outlook (7.5%). All together 13 indicators are used, and out of these the total weight of bibliometric indicators is 38.5%. All indicators are normalized to university size or scientific area. Elsevier\u2019s SciVal (based on Scopus data) is used as publication and citations source.\nThe QS\u2014World University Ranking is published by the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) company. Universities are ranked based on six key metrics in the ranking: academic reputation (40%), employer reputation (10%), faculty/ student ratio (20%), citations per faculty (20%), international faculty ratio (5%), and international student ratio (5%). There is only one bibliometric indicator (citations per faculty\u201420%) which is normalized to the scientific area, and self-citations are excluded. Elsevier\u2019s SciVal (based on Scopus data) is used as publication and citations source.\nThe Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU, also called ShanghaiRanking) was first published in 2003. Since 2009 the ARWU has been published by ShanghaiRanking Consultancy, which is a fully independent organization. It ranks the first 1000 universities, using six indicators, including quality of education (10%), quality of faculty (40%), research output (40%), and per capita performance (10%). The two normalized bibliometric indicators have a total weight of 40%, and one bibliometric related (number of highly cited researchers) indicator weights 20%. Clarivate\u2019s InCites database (based on Web of Science Core Collection data) is used as publication and citations source.\nThe U.S.News Best Global Universities Ranking was launched by U.S.News & World Report in 2014. It ranks universities based on thirteen indicators, including global research reputation (12.5%), regional research reputation (12.5%), and eleven bibliometric indicators (75%). It contains size-dependent indicators, but some indicators are normalized. Clarivate\u2019s InCites database (based on Web of Science Core Collection data) is used as publication and citations source.\n3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:14193 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35306-1\nAfter analyzing all four rankings, we got a common list with 470 universities included in at least one ranking among the top 300 universities. Of these, nine universities were found in one ranking only, 25 universities were found in two rankings, 48 universities were missing from one ranking, and 388 institutions were found in all four rankings.\nRanking positions vs. determined parameters. First, we compared the ranking positions to the selected scientometric parameters, the number of students, and enrollment. All together 105 correlations were computed, and in 98 cases there were correlations (p < 0.05) between ranking positions and the determined parameter. The high proportion of significant correlations between ranking indicators and rank positions of the universities in most cases proves that bibliometrics related indicators play an important role in each of the examined rankings. The correlations were stronger with a particular ranking\u2019s own indicators. We observed lower correlation in four cases: USNews international collaboration (relative) (corr.coeff = 0.24, p = 1.25e\u221207), USNews conferences (corr.coeff = 0.31, p = 5.86e\u221212), THE international outlook (corr.coeff = \u22120.41, p = 1.61e\u221219), and QS citations per faculty (corr.coeff = \u22120.44, p = 1.78e\u221222), Of these, the first three represent indicators with low weight, but the last one gives 20% weight of the entire ranking. University sizes shows medium correlation with ARWU and USNews ranking results, but there is no correlation with THE and QS rankings. The highest positive correlation coefficients were present for citations and percentage of papers in the top 1%, while the strongest negative correlations were present for two non-ranked parameters, the number of highly cited researchers and publications in Nature and Science. The complete results are presented in Fig.\u00a01.\nDifferences in ranking positions vs. determined parameters. Next, we investigated the correlation between the ranking position differences and the determined scientometric parameters. In this analysis, high correlation values mean high importance for this parameter and low correlations mean small importance in determining ranking differences between the four investigated rankings. All together 126 correlations were evaluated, and in 99 cases we found significant correlations (p < 0.05).\nThe most significant correlations were observed in case of the THE citations and the USNews normalized citation impact indicators. Although both of these indicators represent the citation impact of publications relative to their scientific discipline, but they use two different data sources, Web of Science and Scopus. The two indicators show higher correlation in THE\u2013QS and in THE\u2013ARWU pairs proving that universities with higher discipline-specific citation reach better ranking in THE compared to QS or ARWU. Albeit with lower correlation values, these universities also have better ranks in USNews. When comparing THE and USNews, THE has a positive value also linked to the higher weight of citation in THE (30%).\nIn case of THE\u2013QS and of the ARWU\u2013USNews pairs, the differences do not show correlation with university size while in case of the QS/ARWU vs THE/USNews pairs the differences show high correlation values. These results support the notion that QS and THE rankings are better for small universities with high impact while larger universities can reach better scores in ARWU and USNews rankings.\nThe detailed analysis results are shown in Fig.\u00a02.\nComparing all determined parameters to each other. We also correlated all the investigated parameters to each other across all included universities. In this, 441 associations were checked, 399 of which had a significant correlation (p < 0.05).\nParticularly high correlations can be observed for USNews scientometric parameters including the number of publications in the top 10% and top 1%, and citations in the top 10% and top 1%. These results provide evidence that the overall impact of these parameters is amplified by their influence on the other parameters. Of note, the percentage of top 10% and top 1% are also positively correlated.\nSimilarly, significant correlations can be observed between the size-dependent parameters of ARWU and USNews. The complete results for all parameters are depicted in Fig.\u00a03.\nOutstanding universities. A particularly interesting analysis involves the \u201coutstanding universities\u201d, which have excellent position in one ranking but mediocre position in another. All together twelve outstanding university groups were compared with the control groups (which include all non-outstanding universities) for the 22 determined parameters. The analysis includes universities outstanding in THE vs. the three other rankings (Fig.\u00a04A), universities outstanding in QS vs. the three other rankings (Fig.\u00a04B), universities outstanding in ARWU compared to the other universities (Fig.\u00a04C), and universities outstanding in USNews compared to other rankings (Fig.\u00a04D). Note that because outstanding universities have better positions (lower number), the ranking difference is negative for almost each parameter.\nWe also studied the typical disciplines of the universities selected with this method. We examined the differences of OpenAlex root level concepts scores (19 concepts and three concept groups) between outstanding university groups and control groups. In this analysis, we found significant differences (Mann\u2013Whitney p < 0.01, two-tailed) in case of 98 outstanding groups (see result in Fig.\u00a05A\u2013D). The main results show that outstanding universities in THE ranking have higher score in social sciences and universities which perform better in USNews and QS ranking have higher score in science, technology, and medicine fields and lower score in social sciences.\nThe university size parameter was also examined when comparing outstanding and control university groups. Results show that universities outstanding in QS and THE compared to ARWU and USNews have significantly differed with lower number of students (Mann\u2013Whitney p < 0.01 two-tailed) and conversely, universities outstanding in ARWU and USNews compared to THE and QS had higher median of number of students (Fig.\u00a06).\n4 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:14193 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35306-1"

Our results clearly show that smaller universities have better results in size independent rankings including the THE and QS, while bigger universities can perform better in USNews and ARWU rankings which both have size-dependent indicators.

Previously, it has been shown that ranking scores correlate with the publication output and citations of a university15. It was also established and extended that broader field coverage is also an advantage in rankings16. Our results confirmed that scientometric indicators play a major role in rankings. We have found significant correlations between almost all bibliometricrelated indicators and positions in each examined ranking. Our results also show that the absolute number of publications and citations are particularly important in ARWU and USNews rankings, and scientific category normalized (field weighted) citation impact is important in THE and USNews rankings.\nEach ranking uses different indicators to measure the performance of universities, which vary from one ranking to another. Remarkably, many of these different parameters used for the rankings are not truly independent and we found strong correlations between examined parameters in some cases. These similarities can be divided to two groups: first, the correlation is actually high because of the natural phenomenon that the indicators can be similar in different rankings, e.g., ARWU publications and USNews publications or THE citation and USNews normalized citation impact show similar data from different sources which have significant\nRankDiff THE-QS\nRankDiff THE-ARWU\nRankDiff THE-USNews\nRankDiff QS-ARWU RankDiff QS-USNews RankDiff ARWU-USNews\nCon nuous indicators THE FTE of Students -0.07 n=421\n0.49 n=406\n0.50 n=423\n0.49 n=393\n0.47 n=409\n-0.16 n=400\nUSNews Enroll (# of Students)\n-0.06 n=284\n0.48 n=280\n0.48 n=290\n0.45 n=275\n0.44 n=285\n-0.17 n=282\nQS cita ons per faculty -0.03 n=421 -0.12 n=393 -0.14 n=409 -0.07 n=403 -0.04 n=421 0.05 n=398\nTHE cita on -0.52n=421 -0.34 n=406 -0.28 n=423 0.11 n=393 0.27 n=409 0.29 n=400\nTHE research -0.07 n=421 -0.21 n=406 -0.30 n=423 -0.14 n=393 -0.14 n=409 -0.04 n=400\nTHE interna onal outlook 0.07 n=421 -0.45 n=406 -0.35 n=423 -0.38 n=393 -0.29 n=409 0.30\nn=400 ARWU # highly cited\nresearchers -0.13 n=393 0.23 n=406 0.13 n=400 0.36 n=403 0.26 n=398 -0.22 n=423\nARWU Nature and Science -0.13n=393 0.20 n=406 0.06 n=400 0.26 n=403 0.17 n=398 -0.21 n=423\nARWU publica ons 0.07 n=393 0.39 n=406 0.30 n=400 0.32 n=403 0.23 n=398 -0.24\nn=423 ARWU per capita\nperformance -0.07 n=393 -0.01 n=406 -0.13 n=400 0.05 n=403 0.00 n=398 -0.10\nn=423 Ranked indicators\nUSNews publica ons -0.03 n=409 -0.34 n=400 -0.30 n=423 -0.30 n=398 -0.26 n=421 0.20 n=423\nUSNews books 0.15n=409 0.05 n=400 -0.01 n=423 -0.05 n=398 -0.14 n=421 -0.09 n=423\nUSNews conferences -0.32n=409 -0.25 n=400 -0.26 n=423 -0.01 n=398 0.08 n=421 0.15\nn=423 USNews normalized\ncita on impact 0.45 n=409 0.28 n=400 0.16 n=423 -0.13 n=398 -0.32 n=421 -0.33 n=423\nUSNews total cita ons 0.09n=409 -0.25 n=400 -0.25 n=423 -0.32 n=398 -0.33 n=421 0.09 n=423\nUSNews # top 10% cited 0.09n=409 -0.25 n=400 -0.25 n=423 -0.34 n=398 -0.35 n=421 0.10 n=423 USNews % top 10% cited 0.38n=409 0.19 n=400 0.08 n=423 -0.18 n=398 -0.32 n=421 -0.23\nn=423 USNews interna onal\ncollabora on (rela ve) -0.06 n=409 -0.11 n=400 -0.16 n=423 -0.05 n=398 -0.05 n=421 0.00 n=423 USNews # top 1% cited 0.14n=409 -0.21 n=400 -0.23 n=423 -0.33 n=398 -0.36 n=421 0.03 n=423 USNews % top 1% cited 0.37n=409 0.18 n=400 0.06 n=423 -0.18 n=398 -0.32 n=421 -0.25 n=423\nFigure\u00a02.

The second group involves indicators correlated to each other within one ranking. We found that indicators measuring absolute values in USNews ranking are highly correlated with each other. For example, universities performing well in the publications indicator also rank well in the citation\u2019s indicator, similar to the #top 1% cited and #top 10% cited indicators.\nWe have to mention several criticisms of university rankings formulated by different research groups. Vernon et\u00a0al. summarized several doubts about the rankings, suggesting that the significance of the reputation questionnaire should be kept below 10%12. QS has the highest weight of reputation indicator (50%) of all the rankings we examined, followed by THE (33%) and USNews (25%). Daraio et\u00a0al. abridged the main criticisms of the rankings into following four issues: monodimensionality, i.e. the rankings focus mainly on research among the education, research, and third missions of universities; statistical robustness, i.e. statistical problems of the individual indicators; dependence on university size and subject mix; and lack of consideration of the input\u2013output structure13. As our results show, that ARWU and USNews rankings have high correlation with university size, while THE and QS rankings use normalized parameters.\nWe have to note a limitation of our study: the university ranking websites usually do not provide detailed information on the indicators, so approximations had to be used in some cases. In the THE ranking, the \"Research\" and \"International Outlook\" pillars, whose values are publicly available, were calculated by combining bibliometric and other indicators, so the effect of bibliometric parameters can be distorted in the correlation calculations. In the USNews ranking, the order of each indicator was available instead of the score values, and this contains less information. The exact ranking position in the ARWU list can only be calculated as an approximation, which also causes some bias. A second limitation is the use of different university names. In some ranking sites the English name only while in other sites the local language versions are used. We tried to identify each university in each list precisely, but we cannot completely exclude the possibility of a mismatch. Notably, as we found strong correlation between number-related parameters, it seems that at least for the THE, USNews, and QS rankings this potential bias is negligible. Finally, although we aimed to make all data openly available, the copyright of the original data sources prohibited this goal.\nUnfortunately, in our study it was not possible to give a perfect guide, as one of the limitations of our project is that we only looked at bibliometric indicators (and the university\u2019s size). However, each ranking attempts to find the best universities by weighting different indicators. In our study, we found that, even when using the most objective bibliometric indicators, significant differences in the performance of several universities in each ranking can be detected when using certain types of indicators, and that publication differences in the disciplines\nUSNew s Enroll (# of Students) QS cita ons per faculty\nTHE cita on\nTHE research\nTHE interna ona outlook\nARW U # highly cited researchers\nARW U Nature and Science\nARW U publica ons\nARW U per capita perform ance\nUSNew s publica ons\nUSNew s books\nUSNew s conferences\nUSNew s norm alized cita on im pact\nUSNew s total cita ons\nUSNew s # top 10% cited\nUSNew s % top 10% cited\nUSNew s interna onal collabora on\nUSNew s # top 1% cited\nUSNew s % top 1% cited\nCon nuous indicators THE FTE of Students 0.97 n=290 -0.03 n=421 -0.11 n=440 0.11 n=440 -0.27 n=440 0.31 n=406 0.23 n=406 0.60 n=406 -0.07 n=406 -0.59 n=423 -0.33 n=423 -0.45 n=423 0.14 n=423 -0.53 n=423 -0.53 n=423 0.08 n=423 -0.04 n=423 -0.48 n=423 0.08 n=423 USNews Enroll (# of Students) -0.08 n=285 -0.12 n=290 0.03 n=290 -0.33 n=290 0.25 n=282 0.18 n=282 0.56 n=282 -0.09 n=282 -0.52 n=293 -0.24 n=293 -0.40 n=293 0.16 n=293 -0.45 n=293 -0.45 n=293 0.11 n=293 -0.07 n=293 -0.40 n=293 0.09 n=293 QS cita ons per faculty 0.33 n=421 0.54 n=421 0.23 n=421 0.41 n=403 0.36 n=403 0.32 n=403 0.50 n=403 -0.35 n=421 -0.26 n=421 -0.36 n=421 -0.25 n=421 -0.39 n=421 -0.43 n=421 -0.41 n=421 -0.22 n=421 -0.41 n=421 -0.29 n=421 THE cita on 0.31 n=440 0.37 n=440 0.48 n=406 0.43 n=406 0.20 n=406 0.52 n=406 -0.22 n=423 -0.45 n=423 0.18 n=423 -0.88 n=423 -0.40 n=423 -0.40 n=423 -0.78 n=423 -0.04 n=423 -0.49 n=423 -0.81 n=423 THE research 0.24 n=440 0.51 n=406 0.62 n=406 0.57 n=406 0.55 n=406 -0.64 n=423 -0.58 n=423 -0.42 n=423 -0.28 n=423 -0.65 n=423 -0.65 n=423 -0.36 n=423 -0.18 n=423 -0.63 n=423 -0.27 n=423 THE interna onal outlook 0.14 n=406 0.12 n=406 -0.11 n=406 0.36 n=406 0.05 n=423 -0.37 n=423 0.13 n=423 -0.40 n=423 -0.06 n=423 -0.05 n=423 -0.35 n=423 0.11 n=423 -0.11 n=423 -0.35 n=423 ARWU # highly cited researchers 0.64 n=431 0.64 n=431 0.50 n=431 -0.64 n=423 -0.44 n=423 -0.30 n=423 -0.45 n=423 -0.71 n=423 -0.74 n=423 -0.57 n=423 -0.18 n=423 -0.77 n=423 -0.56 n=423 ARWU Nature and Science 0.57 n=431 0.56 n=431 -0.63 n=423 -0.56 n=423 -0.25 n=423 -0.45 n=423 -0.71 n=423 -0.71 n=423 -0.52 n=423 -0.23 n=423 -0.72 n=423 -0.50 n=423 ARWU publica ons 0.35 n=431 -0.96 n=423 -0.47 n=423 -0.57 n=423 -0.09 n=423 -0.91 n=423 -0.90 n=423 -0.19 n=423 -0.15 n=423 -0.84 n=423 -0.15 n=423 ARWU per capita performance -0.38 n=423 -0.43 n=423 -0.05 n=423 -0.53 n=423 -0.47 n=423 -0.46 n=423 -0.55 n=423 -0.19 n=423 -0.50 n=423 -0.52 n=423 Ranked indicators USNews publica ons 0.53 n=451 0.56 n=451 0.14 n=451 0.97 n=451 0.96 n=451 0.23 n=451 0.13 n=451 0.91 n=451 0.22 n=451 USNews books 0.23 n=451 0.40 n=451 0.60 n=451 0.59 n=451 0.38 n=451 -0.04 n=451 0.58 n=451 0.33 n=451 USNews conferences -0.31 n=451 0.45 n=451 0.47 n=451 -0.16 n=451 0.26 n=451 0.38 n=451 -0.22 n=451 USNews normalized cita on impact 0.36 n=451 0.36 n=451 0.88 n=451 0.06 n=451 0.46 n=451 0.90 n=451 USNews total cita ons 0.99 n=451 0.43 n=451 0.13 n=451 0.98 n=451 0.42 n=451 USNews # top 10% cited 0.46 n=451 0.15 n=451 0.98 n=451 0.43 n=451 USNews % top 10% cited 0.17 n=451 0.54 n=451 0.89 n=451 USNews interna onal collabora on (rela ve) 0.16 n=451 0.16 n=451 USNews # top 1% cited 0.56 n=451\nFigure\u00a03.

Based on these considerations, it is likely that the use of disciplinespecific rankings would be more effective than overall rankings for the study of education, research and services.\nUniversity ranking systems are on the rise and influence the perceived prestige of a university. Here, we have determined the effects of scientometric parameters on university ranking positions. Notably, there are also other reasons why one group of universities have significantly different results in rankings, e.g., diversified territorial and educational contexts can cause structural biases17. In this study we have identified factors significantly related to the outstanding status. Overall, strong publication activity is an important factor in each ranking, but significant differences in ranking places depend on both the selected indicators used by the ranking and the publication and citation characteristics of the universities."

            "text": "Setting up a matched ranking for top universities. We selected four internationally recognized rankings from three continents, Europe, North-America and Asia. A common characteristic of these rankings was the availability of detailed ranking data. We used the most recent version of the four chosen rankings including the Times Higher Education World University Ranking 2022 edition (THE), the QS World University Rankings 2022 edition (QS) the ShanghaiRanking\u2014Academic Ranking of World Universities 2021 edition (ARWU), and the U.S.News Best Global Universities Ranking 2022 edition (USNews).\nRecomputing ranking scores for scientometric indicators. Because most ranking websites do not publish exact ranking results, only bins, we had to calculate the ranking positions of the universities according to the ranking\u2019s published methodology. For example, in ARWU, the total scores were available only for the first 100 universities, for the other universities the total scores could not be derived from the public data, so we used estimation of the total score based on the values of each indicator using their methodology.\nWe selected bibliometrics-related indicator values from the four rankings, which were available on the webpage of the rankings. This includes altogether twenty indicators (one indicator from QS, three indicators from THE, four indicators from ARWU, and 12 indicators from USNews) which are described in detail in Table\u00a01. Notably, the total weight of scientometric parameters is 60% in THE, 60% in ARWU, 20% in QS, and 75% in USNews.\nWe also collected available data on university sizes, which was the \u201cNumber of Students\u201d parameter from THE and \u201cEnrollment\u201d value from USNews. These two parameters were the same for most universities, but they originate from different data collection processes.\nFigure\u00a04.

Only those median differences are shown where the two group significantly differed (p < 0.01).\n9 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:14193 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35306-1\nIndicator abbreviation Ranking Indicator original name % of overall size dependent Definition Indicator origin (database) Indicator type\nTHE citation THE Citations 30% no Citation ratio compared to average in same field, area, type and year Scopus Citation\nTHE research THE Research (Includes research productivity) 30% (6%) no Number of publications (article, review)/number of staff FTE Scopus Publication\nTHE international outlook THE International Outlook (Includes collaboration) 7.5% (2.50%) no % of articles Scopus Publication\nQS citations per faculty QS Citations per faculty 20% yes\nThe total number of citations received by all papers produced by an institution across a fiveyear period by the number of faculty members at that institution Scopus Citation\nUSNews publications USNews Publications 10% yes The total number of scholarly papers\u2014reviews, articles and notes Web of Science Publication\nUSNews books USNews Books 2.50% yes The total number of books Web of Science Publication\nUSNews conferences USNews Conferences 2.50% yes The total number of conference abstracts, proceeding papers\nWeb of Science Publication\nUSNews normalized citation impact USNews Normalized citation impact 10% yes\nThe total number of citations per paper Web of Science Citation\nUSNews total citations USNews Total citations 7.50% yes The total number of citations Web of Science Citation\nUSNews # top 10% cited USNews Number of publications that are among the 10% most cited\n12.50% yes\nThe number of papers that have been assigned as being in the top 10% of the most highly cited papers in the world for their respective fields Web of Science Publication\nUSNews % top 10% cited USNews Percentage of total publications that are among the 10% most cited 10% no\nThe percentage of a university\u2019s total papers that are among the top 10% of the\u00a0most highly cited papers in the world\u2014per field and publication year Web of Science Publication\nUSNews # top 1% cited USNews Number of highly cited papers that are among the top 1% most cited in their respective field 5% yes\nNumber of highly cited papers that are among the top 1% most cited in their respective field based on the Clarivate\u2019s Essential Science Indicators\u2122 Web of Science Publication\nUSNews % top 1% cited USNews Percentage of total publications that are among the top 1% most highly cited papers\n5% no\nThe number of highly cited papers for a university divided by the total number of documents it produces Web of Science Publication\nUSNews international collaboration (relative) USNews International collaboration\u2014relative to country 5% no\nThe proportion of the institution\u2019s total papers that contain international co-authors divided by the proportion of internationally co-authored papers for the country that the university is in Web of Science Publication\nARWU Nature and Science ARWU N&S\u2014Papers published in Nature and Science 20% yes\nThe number of papers published in Nature and Science between 2016 and 2020.

As USNews ranking did not publish the scores of different indicators, only by the rank by the indicator values, we calculated the ranking positions for each used indicator in order to make these indicators easily comparable where this was reasonable.\nCreating merged ranking of universities listed among the top 300 in at least one ranking. A unified ranking of universities was created by merging universities which were among the top 300 in any of selected four rankings. Different university names in different rankings have been manually identified and merged (e.g., in some cases a local name was used in one ranking and English name in another). For each university in the merged list, we collected the ranking positions and indicator scores and/or ranking position values from all four selected rankings even in case the university was not listed in the other rankings. If the university was not listed at all in a ranking, the ranking place and the determined parameter indicators were left empty. In each case, we tried to identify the reason for being excluded from a particular ranking. In some cases, we found that QS did not list some universities because they are specialized in one specific field. Some institutions were listed as a part of a larger institution in one ranking, and separately in other rankings (e.g., Indian Institute of Technology).\nDetermining typical disciplines of universities. To identify the most typical scientific fields of each university we used OpenAlex database concepts which classifies scientific works using an automated algorithm18. OpenAlex has 19 root level concepts, and concepts score values are aggregated at the university level. We have collected the score values of root level concepts of all universities, and we summarized score values of concepts to three categories, including (1) Science, Technology, and Medicine which contains the following concepts: Computer science, Biology, Medicine, Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, Materials science, Mathematics, Geography, Geology, and Environmental science; (2) Social Sciences, which contain Economics, Political science, Philosophy, Psychology, Business, and Sociology; and (3) Arts & Humanities, including Art and History.\nStatistical analysis. We used Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient to evaluate the correlation between ranking positions and determined parameters in order to assess the overall weight of the investigated parameters. Also, Spearman\u2019s rank correlation was computed to correlate the positions in different rankings vs. the parameters, and between the determined parameters.\nIn a separate analysis, for each ranking pair (THE-QS, THE-USNews, THE-ARWU, QS-USNews, QS-ARWU, USNews-ARWU, and their reverse complementary pairs) universities for which the difference in ranking positions exceeded 100 were classified as \u201coutstanding universities\u201d in the given pair of rankings. Parameters and score values of OpenAlex concepts of outstanding groups and control groups were compared using the Mann\u2013Whitney two-sample rank-sum test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.01 in the study."
