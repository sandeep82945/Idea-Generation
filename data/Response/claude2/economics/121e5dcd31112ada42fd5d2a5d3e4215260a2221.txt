 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct similar research on CSR perception and consumer behavior in other EU countries to allow for cross-country comparisons. Since this study was limited to Slovakia, expanding the research to other markets could provide useful insights into cultural differences.

2. Examine the impact of specific CSR initiatives (e.g. environmental, social, governance) on consumer attitudes and purchase intent. The study could investigate which types of CSR resonate most with consumers. 

3. Research the role of CSR communication and how messaging affects consumer trust and brand perceptions. The study could look at optimal communication strategies and channels.

4. Analyze how CSR influences consumer decision-making over the entire purchase process, from awareness to post-purchase, using surveys and experiments. This could provide a more complete understanding.

5. Investigate generational differences in CSR attitudes and behaviors more deeply using qualitative methods like interviews and focus groups. The research could uncover more nuanced insights into young consumers' perspectives.
