In particular, the reaction of 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-amine (1) with 2-bromo ketones 2\u0430\u2013n in EtOAc at room temperature led to 3-substituted pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazole hydrobromides 3\u0430\u2013n (no yields given).9 At the same time, in the case of pyridyl bromo ketone 2\u043e, heating in DMF in the presence of Na2CO3 gave isomeric 2-substituted pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazole 4 in only 14% yield (Scheme 1).10\ncompound 10 with amino ketone hydrochlorides 13\u0430\u2013\u0435 resulted in the formation of 3-arylpyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazoles 14a\u2013e (no yields given, Scheme 4).15\nScheme 1\nTreatment of iminopyrrolidines 5\u0430\u2013d with \u03b1-phenacyl bromides 2\u0440\u2013r in MeCN followed by heating in acetic anhydride led to the formation of pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazolium bromides 6a\u2013\u0435. The latter were smoothly partially reduced with NaBH4 in DMF to afford tetrahydro-1Hpyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazoles 7a\u2013\u0435 (Scheme 2).11\nIntramolecular cyclization of 2-(2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl)acetamide (8) by the action of POBr3 or POCl3 gave 2-halosubstituted pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazoles 9a,b (Scheme 3).12 The microwave modification of this method made it possible to synthesize compound 9a in 82% yield.13\nCyclocondensation of 2-methoxypyrroline 10 with aminoacetonitrile hydrochloride (11) in i-PrOH under reflux led to 6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazol3-amine hydrochloride (12),14 while cyclocondensation of\nScheme 2\nScheme 3\nThe reaction of pyrroline 10 with 2,2-dimethoxyethanamine (15a) in the CH2Cl2\u2013MeOH system gave aminopyrroline 16, the cyclization of which in formic acid gave the simplest 6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazole (17a) (Scheme 5).16,17 Its 6,6-dimethyl analog 17b was obtained in quantitative yield by similar transformations from 3,3-dimethyl-5(methylsulfanyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrole hydroiodide (18) and amine 15\u0430 (Scheme 6).16\nA four-step synthesis of (S)-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazol-6-ol (22) was developed based on silylation of 4-hydroxypyrrolidin-2-one (19a), transformation of the\nScheme 4\nobtained derivative 19b into cyclic imidate 20, its subsequent amination with aminoacetal 15b, and cyclization of the resulting amidine 21 (Scheme 7).18,19\nScheme 5\nScheme 6\nScheme 7\n6-Aryl-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazoles 24a\u2013k were synthesized from \u03b3-lactams 23a\u2013k by O-methylation with Meerwein's reagent followed by amidination with aminoethyl diethyl acetal 15b and cyclization under acidic conditions (no yields given, Scheme 8).20\nA patent21 describes a method for the synthesis of 6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazole-2-carboxylate (27) by the reaction of ethyl 3-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)acrylate (25) with 4-nitrobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate (26) in MeCN at room temperature followed by cyclization of\nScheme 8\nintermediate hydrazone A in the presence of a base (no yield given, Scheme 9).\nThe synthesis of dihydropyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazole2,3-dicarboxylate 30 is based on the reaction of pyrrolidine 28\u0430 with acetylenedicarboxylate 29\u0430 and involves the one-pot formation of four C\u2013N bonds, which is realized via the steps of hydroamination/azidation/cyclization (Scheme 10).22\nScheme 9\nTo obtain 2,3-disubstituted pyrrolo[1,2-\u0430]imidazoles 33\u0430\u2013g, one-pot three-component condensation of aryl 1,2- diketones 31\u0430\u2013g, L-proline (32\u0430), and NH4OAc in a ratio of 1:1:1 was employed. The microwave modification of this method proved to be suitable for 3-hydroxy-L-proline (32b) and was employed to access pyrrolo[1,2-\u0430]imidazol6-ols 33h\u2013k (Scheme 11).23\nThe one-pot synthesis of 6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazoles 35a\u2013f was developed on the basis of a cascade of [3+2] cycloaddition and oxidative aromatization reactions. The reaction of phenacyl azides 34a\u2013f with L-proline (32a) in PhMe under reflux led to the target products 35\u0430\u2013f in high yields (Scheme 12).24\nPhotocatalytic annulation with decarboxylation of L-proline (32\u0430) with \u03b1-azidochalcones 36a\u2013r in the presence of ruthenium(III) polyvinylpyridine complex (Ru(III)-P4VP) proved to be an effective method for constructing pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazoles 37a\u2013r.

The use of pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazoles as organocatalysts\nPyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazole derivatives have found wide application in various fields of organic synthesis as selective organocatalysts. Thus, 7-alkoxy-substituted chiral 6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazoles 168\u0430\u2013d were successfully used in the asymmetric Steglich rearrangement.26 In addition, derivatives 168\u0430\u2013c were first used for the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral compounds (Fig. 3).91\nAn original low molecular weight catalyst 169 was constructed based on the scaffold of a chiral 6,7-dihydro5H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazole (Fig. 3). It promotes the insertion of P-stereogenic phosphoramidates into nucleoside structures via a dynamic stereoselective process.92\nMore recently, reports have appeared on the use of (pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazol-7-yl)carbamates 170\u0430,b for organocatalytic asymmetric phosphoramidation of one of the intermediates in the synthesis of the drug remdesivir which is used to treat COVID-19 (Fig. 3).93,94\nChiral esters based on pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazoles 171\u0430\u2013\u0435 proved to be effective catalysts for the enantioselective Black rearrangement (Fig. 4).28 In addition, ((R)-6,7dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazol-7-yl)acetate (171a) has found application in direct catalytic enantioselective C-acylation for the construction of the quaternary stereocenter of 3-substituted benzofuran-2(3H)-ones.95\n(S)-7-Cyclohexyl-3-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)-6,7-dihydro-5Hpyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazole (172) was successfully used for the kinetic separation of aryl and hetaryl alkyl carbinols with high enantioselectivity (Fig. 4).96\nChiral dialkylaluminum complexes of 6,7-dihydro-5Hpyrrolo[1,2-\u0430]imidazol-7-ols 173\u0430,b were tested as effective initiators of ring opening of \u03b5-caprolactone during polymerization (Fig. 4).97\n4.2. The use of pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazoles as ionic liquids\nAnother area of practical application of functionalized pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazoles is ionic liquids. Affinity ionic liquids of pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazolium 174a,b are capable of binding to peptides and proteins, which has been used for liquid-liquid extraction and purification of hexahistidinetagged (His-tagged) proteins (Fig. 5).37,98\nFigure 4. The catalysts of enantioselective processes 171a\u2013e, kinetic separation of aryl and hetaryl alkyl carbinols 172, and polymerization initiators pyrrolo[1,2-\u0430]imidazoles 173a,b.\nFigure 5. The affinity ionic liquids 174a,b capable of binding to biomacromolecules.\nQuartz crystal microbalance (QCM) chips thinly coated with sensitive ionic liquids 175\u0430\u2013d proved effective for the chemoselective detection of aldehydes, ketones, and amines in gases.99,100 The use of 1-butylpyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazolium (trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (175c) for the separation of Th-227 and Ac-225 isotopes by extraction with N,N,N',N'-tetraoctyldiglycolamide also deserves attention (Fig. 6).38\nIn turn, the 1,3,5-triazine-containing ionic liquids 176a,b on QCM chips seem to be very promising for\nchemoselective detection of gaseous amines and alcohols (Fig. 6).101\nEqually important is the development of the specialized ionic liquids 177a,b on QCM chips for on-line and chemoselective real-time detection of organic azides (Fig. 6).102\n4.3. Biomedical potential of pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazoles\nHeterocyclic compounds based on the pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazole ring are attractive objects for biomedical research. Thus, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-[(4-phenoxyphenylcarbamoyl)methyl]-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazol-1-ium chloride (178) has a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Notably, compound 178 is characterized by high hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and cytotoxicity against the HEK-293 cell line, but has low in vivo toxicity in mice (LD50 >2000 mg/kg) (Fig. 7).15\nEffective inhibitors of the WIN region of the WDR5 scaffolding protein, which regulates chromatin and is overexpressed in various types of cancer, were identified among 2-aryl-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazoles. Derivatives 179\u0430\u2013\u0441 are characterized by dissociation constants <10 nM and micromolar cellular activity against acute myeloid leukemia (Fig. 8).12\nModified pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazoles 180 were evaluated as degraders of the WDR5 protein, but despite only\nFigure 7. The quaternary salt of pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazol-1-ium 178 with antimicrobial activity.\ninhibiting a subset of WDR5 protein interactions, chemically induced proteasomal degradation of the WDR5 protein could represent an elegant way to target all oncogenic processes (Fig. 9).13\n3-Aryl-substituted 6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazoles 14d,f may find application in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer. These molecules have been shown to block the nuclear localization of androgen receptors in prostate cancer (Fig. 10).9,103\n(1S,3R)-3-Acetamido-N-[4-(6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazol-3-yl)pyridin-2-yl]cyclohexanecarboxamides 181\u0430\u2013\u0441 inhibit cyclin-dependent kinase CDK9 and may be useful\nFigure 11. The inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase CDK9 181\u0430\u2013\u0441.\nFigure 12. The androgen receptor inhibitor 182.\nin the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases. No less important is the effect of compounds 181 on phosphorylation of the Ser2 residue of RNA polymerase II in the breast cancer cell line (MCF7) and on MV4-11 cells of biphenotypic B-myelomonocytic leukemia (Fig. 11).16\nStructural modification of the pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazole ring was used to construct derivative 182 containing a cereblon ligand that binds to E3 ubiquitin ligase, as well as a fragment capable of binding to the androgen receptor and inhibiting it (Fig. 12).17\nThe optically pure pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazoles 22, 183\u0430,b are progesterone receptor (PR) antagonists and are useful in the treatment of endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and related conditions as well as in the treatment of breast, ovarian, or endometrial cancer (Fig. 13).18\n6,7-Dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazole-2-sulfonamide 184 has the ability to inhibit the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and may be useful in the treatment of a wide range of diseases in which the NLRP3 inflammasome is considered the key inflammation-regulating factor.41\nN N\nN NHCl\nO\nHN Me\nO\nN N\nN NHCl\nO\nHN Me\nO\nMe Me\nN N\nN NHF\nO\nHN Me\nO\nMe Me\n181a CDK9, ATP conc. at Km\nIC50 = 0.005 M CDK9, high ATP conc.\nIC50 = 0.35 M p-Ser 2 RNAP II IC50 = 0.83 M\nMV4-11 caspase activity IC50 = 0.701 M\n181b CDK9, ATP conc. at Km\nIC50 < 0.003 M CDK9, high ATP conc.\nIC50 = 0.011 M p-Ser 2 RNAP II IC50 = 0.36 M\nMV4-11 caspase activity IC50 = 0.054 M\n181c CDK9, ATP conc. at Km\nIC50 < 0.003 M CDK9, high ATP conc.\nIC50 = 0.005 M p-Ser 2 RNAP II IC50 = 0.019 M\nMV4-11 caspase activity IC50 = 0.026 M\n2.

WO Patent 2019012063.\nIn turn, N-(pyrrolo[1,2-\u0430]imidazol-3-yl)acetamide 185 was tested as an inhibitor of human tropomyosin receptor kinase A (hTrkA) (Fig. 14).104\nPerhydropyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazole 186 was revealed as a selective antagonist of the melanocortin-4 receptor (pA2 = 8.086 M) and also weakens the binding of an agonist, including \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and of an inverse agonist, including a protein related to the melanocortin receptor (Fig. 14).105\u2013108 1-(p-Tolyl)tetrahydro5H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazole-2,5(3H)-dione (187) may be promising for treatment and prevention of peripheral neurotoxicity induced by chemotherapy (Fig. 14).109,110\nTo conclude, the analysis of literature sources indicates that, in most cases, the construction of various pyrroloimidazole systems uses the annulation of the imidazole ring to the pyrrole ring or vice versa. However, ring expansion reactions, rearrangements, recyclizations, cascade and multicomponent reactions, as well as one-pot methods for the formation of the pyrroloimidazole framework are of considerable interest among the methods of synthesis of pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazoles. The practical significance of partially and fully hydrogenated pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazoles is due to their use in organic synthesis as selective catalysts, ionic liquids in analytical sensors, and for the creation of pharmacologically active substances.\nReferences\u00a0\n1.
