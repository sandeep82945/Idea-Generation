Insulators, conductors, and semiconductors are the three distinct properties of oxide-perovskites. In addition to their excellent electrical properties, these compounds are also capable of possessing a stable crystalline structure. Applications of oxide perovskites that support sustainability and renewable energy are being investigated. They are employed in solid oxide fuel cells, for instance, which provide effective energy conversion with little emissions. Perovskite-based catalysts can also reduce environmental problems, including air pollution. Perovskite materials are being investigated for cutting-edge data storage and processing technologies such as spintronics and magneto-optics because of their distinctive magnetic and electrical properties. The exploration of oxide perovskites presents the possibility of nding unique materials with novel properties, which may result in innovations in a number of disciplines. It has also been pointed out that these materials have applications in lithography, opto-electrics, batteries, and lenses.1\u20135 In particular, oxide perovskites have been the subject of a plethora of research because of the continued interest in learning more about their unique features.

The best options are wide bandgap oxide perovskites. Because of their high potential and broad energy band gap, such molecules can be used in the fabrication of vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and ultraviolet (UV3)operating glass.13,14 Ref. 15\u201324 show that several recent studies on oxide perovskite have been described. Because of its large direct band-gap and ensembles of the imaginary component of the insulating features in the ultra-violet region, BaCsO3 was found to be appropriate for optoelectronic devices by Harmel et al.,18 who utilized DFT to investigate the characteristics of barium-based oxide perovskite. The work of Daniel et al.19 aer looking at a few properties of LiBaO3, it became clear that it may be used to store energy. Compounds with band gaps larger than 3.10 eV will function well in the UV region of the electromagnetic spectrum. SrHfO3 and SrPtO3 are promising candidates for electronic applications because of their nonmetallic properties and their position among the best semiconductors. In this study, we used DFT and the FP-LAPW method to analyze some of the important features of SrMO3 (M = Hf and Pt) of oxide perovskites in order to use it as a tool for future research. Structure, elasticity, electricity, and optics are all part of these features."

These crystals belong to the space group (Pm 3m# 221) and have a single molecule, cubic unit cell structure, conforming to the ABO3 formula, revealing the structure of oxide perovskite. The arrangement of atoms within the unit cell follows a specic pattern, with Sr atoms located at (0, 0, 0) positions, M (M = Hf and Pt), and oxygen atoms at (0, 1/2, 1/2), (1/2, 0, 1/2), and (1/2, 1/2, 0), and (0.50, 0.50, 0.50), respectively, as shown in Fig. 1. To predict the arrangement behavior of the chosen crystals, we used Birch\u2013Murnaghan's equation of state to compute the volume optimization. This allowed us to determine the total energy surrounding Vo, which is the volume of the unit cell at equilibrium conditions. By reducing the unit cell's overall energy, we obtained the lowest stable unit cell. We then analytically calculated the data from Birch\u2013Murnaghan's equation of state to predict the lowest state properties of the unit cell, as shown in Fig. 2. These properties include the steadiness lattice numbers ao, the bulk modulus B, and its pressure derivative B\u2032. The true the minimal ground state of the specic chemical is given by Eo, for which the volume receives its lowest value, V0. The structures of crystals with higher negative energy are more stable. Table 1 presents the optimized structural parameters, such as ao, Eo, V0, Bo, and B\n\u2032, which are necessary for structural comparison. The outcomes conrm that the bulk modulus decreases as the lattice numbers increase, which is consistent with the general trend of this technique. The accuracy and precision of our computed results are demonstrated by these ndings.

Fig. 4 provides the total and partial densities of the states calculated, from which we obtained a clear image of the energy state contribution of various states in the lower and upper bands. The Fermi line is drawn vertically between the conduction and valence bands and it is assumed that this line represents a barrier with zero energy. The peaks reveal the availability of the electronic energy levels and offer important information about the electronic characteristics and behaviors of the compound. The material's capacity to absorb and emit light at a particular energy is directly correlated with the greatest peaks in the DOS.

Wemay learn important details about every cubic crystal system from the values of the elastic constants C11, C12, and C44. Table 2 lists some elastic constants that are not related to one another. For a cubic crystal to be mechanically stable, the elastic constants must satisfy the following conditions: to ensure that C11 > C12, C11 > 0, C44 > 0, C11 + 2C12 > 0, and B > 0, the following criteria must be satised.34 The mechanical stability of our compounds was inferred from the fact that the calculated elastic constants met all of the aforementioned requirements. Based on our ndings, SrHfO3 is typically stiffer than SrPtO3, with a C11 value of 329.41 GPa compared with 189.71 GPa for SrPtO3. An additional factor, the anisotropic constant (abbreviated as \u201cA\u201d), describes a crystal's propensity to form microscopic cracks. With this information in hand, engineers can examine the tiny response of a crystal to stress. Using the elastic constants we determined previously, we can calculate the values of A for the compounds we selected using the formula below37\nA = 2 \u00d7 C44/C11 \u2212 C12 (1)\nIf A = 1, then the material is isotropic; otherwise, it is anisotropic. In Table 2, we show the \u201cA\u201d values we determined for both of our compounds. The value of \u201cA\u201d for both of these substances is not equal to 1, making them anisotropic; the variance shows how much anisotropy exists. The calculated value of A for the molecule SrHfO3 is 0.538, while the value for the molecule SrPtO3 is 1.632, demonstrating that the molecule SrHfO3 is less isotropic than the molecule SrPtO3. The elastic constants used to determine other crucial parameters, such as Young's modulus (represented by \u201cE\u201d), shear modulus (represented by \u201cG\u201d), and Poisson's ratio (represented by \u201cv\u201d), are summarized in Table 2.

Due to their positive Cauchy's pressures, 144.95 GPa for SrPtO3 and 263.51 GPa for SrHfO3, both of our crystals exhibit ductile properties. On the basis of these calculated values, we conclude that the SrMO3 (M = Hf, Pt) crystals we selected are ductile, anisotropic, robust, and fracture-resistant from a mechanical standpoint.

The reectivity R(u) of a particular substance is the degree to which that substance reects light incident on it. It is calculated from the dielectric function. The threshold values for SrHfO3 and SrPtO3 are 0.05 and 0.28, respectively; neither is zero. Both of our selected compounds showed non-zero reectivity throughout the selected energy range. However, its value for SrHfO3 was increasing with the increase in energy and reached its maximum value of 0.8 at 14 eV, while the reectivity of SrPtO3 uctuated. For the latter, its minimum value was 0.05 at 7.5 eV\n26140 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 26134\u201326143\nand its maximum value was 0.53 at 14 eV. One can say that an energy of less than 6.5 ev for SrPtO3 indicates it is a good reector compared to the SrHfO3 compound. Fig. 8 summarizes the entire mess, and for effective lens materials, it is recommended to use transparent materials, which in this case is SrHfO3."

The fundamental elastic constant, anisotropy factor, Poison ratio, ductility, Cauchy's pressure, shear modulus, Pugh ratio, and Young modulus were among the elastic parameters predicted by the IRelast soware. We conclude that both are ductile, anisotropic, elastically stable, and scratch-resistant based on these fundamental elastic features. These ndings assure us that these crystals can be utilized in several modern electrical gadgets. Using the TB-mbj approximation, we investigated the fundamental electronic characteristics of the chosen crystals. Additionally, it is determined that SrPtO3 and SrHfO3 are conductors and insulators, respectively. The TDOS and PDO details are as follows, SrHfO3 valence band primarily consists of O-tot, whose energy extends from \u22124.4 to 0 eV, with the largest peak occurring at 2.8, which corresponds to \u22121.0 eV. The same states also exhibit peaks at energies of 1.8, 2, and 2.6 at \u22121.5, \u22121.2, and \u22120.6 eV, respectively. The Sr-s state makes up the second-highest contribution in the same band, with a value of 2.0 at 5.8 eV. The Sr-p state makes up a large portion of the conduction band in the same crystal, contributing at its highest levels between 3.2 and 5 eV, with the biggest peak occurring at 3.3 eV. Sr-p and Sr-d states cross the Fermi level and are dominant and enhance the conductivity of the compounds. The valence band of the second compound (SrPtO3) contains a number of states with varying degrees of participation, such as the Pt-p state, which exhibits peaks at \u22126.20, \u22125, \u22124, and 0.2 eV. Similarly, the Sr-p state contributes with an energy range of \u22126 eV to 0 eV. Peaks were observed at \u22126, \u22125, \u22123, \u22122, and 0.20 eV with energies of 0.20, 0.30, 1.40, 1.20, and 1.30, respectively. The Pt-p state contributes energy between 0 and 6.80 eV to the conduction band, with an approximation of 0.1 remaining in this region. The optical properties were studied using the band gap energies of these substances. Our ndings suggest that these crystals have low energy absorption and reectivity of up to 65%, making them suitable for use in high-frequency UV devices.\nConflicts of interest\nThe authors declare no conict of interest."
