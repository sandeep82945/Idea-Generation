    "abstractText": "Over the past decade, materials that combine broken inversion symmetry with metallic conductivity have gone from a thought experiment to one of the fastest growing research topics. In 2013, the observation of the first uncontested polar transition in a metal, LiOsO3, inspired a surge of theoretical and experimental work on the subject, uncovering a host of materials which combine properties previously thought to be contraindicated [Nat. Mater. 12, 1024 (2013)]. As is often the case in a nascent field, the sudden rise in interest has been accompanied by diverse (and sometimes conflicting) terminology. Although \u201cferroelectric-like\u201d metals are well-defined in theory, i.e., materials that undergo a symmetry-lowering transition to a polar phase while exhibiting metallic electron transport, real materials find a myriad of ways to push the boundaries of this definition. Here, we review and explore the burgeoning polar metal frontier from the perspectives of theory, simulation, and experiment while introducing a unified taxonomy. The framework allows one to describe, identify, and classify polar metals; we also use it to discuss some of the fundamental tensions between theory and models of reality inherent in the terms \u201cferroelectric\u201d and \u201cmetals.\u201d In addition, we highlight shortcomings of electrostatic doping simulations in modeling different subclasses of polar metals, noting how the assumptions of this approach depart from experiment. We include a survey of known materials that combine polar symmetry with metallic conductivity, classified according to the mechanisms used to harmonize those two orders and their resulting properties. We conclude by describing opportunities for the discovery of novel polar metals by utilizing our taxonomy.",

Rondinelli\u2021 Department of Materials Science and Engineering,\nNorthwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208, USA (Dated: October 18, 2022)\nOver the past decade, materials that combine broken inversion symmetry with metallic conductivity have gone from a thought experiment to one of the fastest growing research topics. In 2013, the observation of the first uncontested polar transition in a metal, LiOsO3, inspired a surge of theoretical and experimental work on the subject, uncovering a host of materials which combine properties previously thought to be contraindicated [Nat. Mater. 12, 1024 (2013)]. As is often the case in a nascent field, the sudden rise in interest has been accompanied by diverse (and sometimes conflicting) terminology. Although \u201cferroelectric-like\u201d metals are well-defined in theory, i.e., materials that undergo a symmetry-lowering transition to a polar phase while exhibiting metallic electron transport, real materials find a myriad of ways to push the boundaries of this definition. Here, we review and explore the burgeoning polar metal frontier from the perspectives of theory, simulation, and experiment while introducing a unified taxonomy. The framework allows one to describe, identify, and classify polar metals; we also use it to discuss some of the fundamental tensions between theory and models of reality inherent in the terms \u201cferroelectric\u201d and \u201cmetals.\u201d In addition, we highlight shortcomings of electrostatic doping simulations in modeling different subclasses of polar metals, noting how the assumptions of this approach depart from experiment. We include a survey of known materials that combine polar symmetry with metallic conductivity, classified according to the mechanisms used to harmonize those two orders and their resulting properties. We conclude by describing opportunities for the discovery of novel polar metals by utilizing our taxonomy.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe concept of crystalline metals without inversion symmetry, specifically those that lift parity symmetry to support a polar crystal structure, has been frequently attributed to a concise 1965 Letter by Blount and Anderson titled \u201cSymmetry Considerations on Martensitic Transformations: \u2018Ferroelectric\u2019 Metals\u201d [1]. What is less well appreciated is that Blount and Anderson\u2019s article focuses on how a nominally first-order ferroelastic transition, observed at the time in the metallic silicide V3Si, could exhibit second-order character, presumably attributed to a displacive component akin to the paraelectric-toferroelectric transition found in insulating compounds, which exhibit a well-defined polarization below the critical temperature. At the time, nearly all martensitic (ferroelastic) transformations in metals exhibited strong first-order character [2]; yet, V3Si exhibited second-order behavior. The continuous response was rationalized by inferring that the symmetry-break should be like that found in second-order displacive ferroelectrics, hence the quotes around \u201cferroelectric\u201d in the title. Blount and Anderson did not suppose that \u201cferroelectric\u201d metals would possess a switchable polarization. Gauss\u2019s Law dictates that no electric field may exist within a metal [3, 4], so the atomic structure of an ideal polar metal should be immune to perturbation via external applied electric field.\nIronically, for years this same physical law seemed to imply that polar metals should not exist at all. In prototypical ferroelectrics like BaTiO3 it was shown that the polar displacement was stabilized by long-range dipoledipole interactions [5, 6]. In the presence of free charge carriers, such interactions would be completely screened,\nfavoring the centrosymmetric structure. In the decades following Anderson and Blount\u2019s work, it appeared that Gauss\u2019s Law would prevail over the synthesis of a polar metal. There were several candidates in the 2000s which combined polar order and metallicity via compositional ordering, but it was not until 2013 that Shi et al. showed the metal LiOsO3 exhibited a displacive transition [7]. Their work demonstrated that a \u201cferroelectric\u201d-like transition need not rely on long-range interactions, but may derive from local structural effects (geometrically-driven Li displacements in the case of LiOsO3). Since the discovery of LiOsO3 and following the introduction of a \u2018weak-coupling hypothesis\u2019 by Puggioni and Rondinelli outlining mechanisms by which to stabilize polar metals [8], they have garnered significant interest (Fig. 1). It was further accelerated by the discovery of nontrivial topological metals and their ensuing phenomena and properties [9\u201311]. During the rapid increase in scholarship, diverse methods of combining these previously contraindicated properties have been proposed and executed, ranging from degenerately doped ferroelectrics [12\u201315] to metals with hybrid improper polar distortions [16, 17] to twodimensional thin films and interfaces [18\u201320]. Reviews of the classification of different design strategies for polar metals can be found in Refs. 21\u201323.\nAccompanying these materials are a variety of terms. Polar, ferroelectric, \u201cferroelectric,\u201d ferroelectric-like, and native ferroelectric are all qualifiers used to describe metallic systems with broken inversion symmetry. Furthermore, many so-called \u201cferroelectric metals\u201d either push the boundaries of what may be called \u2018metallic\u2019 or do not exhibit a switchable polarization. Given the advances in dielectric, modern polarization, and soft-mode theories [24\u201328], we find that the ferroelectric-like designation and\nar X\niv :2\n21 0.\n05 11\n0v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\ntr l-\nsc i]\n1 5\nO ct\n2 02\n2\n2 1968 1976 1984 1992 2000 2008 2016 year 0 10 20 30 40 ci ta tio ns\nFIG. 1. Citations per year of Anderson and Blount\u2019s 1965 paper on second-order martensitic phase transitions [1]. Data collected from Google Scholar on October 10th, 2022.\nits derivatives [18, 29\u201332] are cumbersome and nonessential descriptions, obfuscating the physics displayed by very different (and yet, equally interesting) classes of materials. In addition, we note that both experimental and computational approaches to studying these materials have at times been abused. Computationally, the background-charge approach to electrostatic doping simulations fails to model reality in multiple underappreciated ways [33, 34]. Meanwhile, in experiment, the application of ferroelectric characterization techniques to materials that are not formally ferroelectrics both erodes the key differences separating metals from dielectrics and can lead to misinterpretations of measured dielectric polarizations, e.g., electric polarization hysteresis [29, 35].\nIn this work, we propose using meaningful atomic and electronic structure descriptions to distinguish materials based on conductivity and symmetry considerations. We begin by discussing the tensions between theory and experiment, as exemplified by both the various methods for combining polar order and metallicity and the shortcomings of our current terminology. These issues are further amplified in computational studies using electronic structure methods, e.g., with the popular background-charge approach to electrostatic doping simulations, which can lead to model results inconsistent with experiment. We then present a survey of polar metals classified using our taxonomy that combines conductivity with broken inversion using terminology based on clearly defined class descriptors.\nII. TENSIONS IN TERMINOLOGY: \u201cFERROELECTRIC\u201d \u201cMETALS\u201d\nBetween the realms of theory and experiment, communication is critical in order to foster a productive relationship. Since communication is built on having a common vocabulary, this makes the terminology we use of utmost importance in seeking to advance the current understanding of our field and not just a pedantic dilemma. In the field of polar metals, however, some classifiers that\nseem obvious in theory are less well-defined in experiment and the result has been confusing and at times unintentionally misleading. We present a few examples of the two most common sources of dissonance between theoretical and experimental labels\u2014namely, \u201cmetallic\u201d and \u201cferroelectric\u201d\u2014and suggest methods for relieving the tension.\nA. Ferroelectric \u201cmetals\u201d\nHow to define metallicity?\u2014The question of how one defines a \u2018metal\u2019 carries significance for many disciplines, but the distinction bears considerable weight when evaluating doped ferroelectrics (FEs), especially as a large number of reports describe doping known FEs as a route to achieve polar or \u201cferroelectric\u201d metals. At what point does a doped ferroelectric become a polar metal? Is there an important fundamental difference between a polar structure with intrinsic charge carriers or extrinsic charge carriers? To answer these questions, let us consider fundamental definitions of metallicity.\nAccording to Kohn\u2019s theory, while the wave function of a metal in its ground state is delocalized, that of an insulator is localized [36]. This distinction strictly defines the difference between metals and insulators. Electron transport considerations can, in principle, be used to quite clearly separate metals from insulators (dielectrics). According to Mott, \u201c. . . a metal conducts, and a nonmetal doesn\u2019t\u201d [37, 38]. This statement is strictly true at T = 0 K and is often used as the discriminating factor between a metal and an insulator (or semiconductor) such that:\nlim T\u21920 \u03c1(T ) = { \u221e insulator \u03c10 metal\n(1)\nwhere \u03c1 corresponds to the electric resistivity of the material and \u03c10 is the residual resistivity due to electron collisions with crystal impurities and imperfections at T = 0 K. Importantly, the value of \u03c1 at room-temperature does not matter; thus, although the definition is mathematically well defined, experimental conditions (T 6= 0 K) can make the differentiation challenging, especially when the carrier density of a semiconductor is sufficiently high at room temperature. These may be intrinsic charge carriers or the result of degenerate doping, such that the material is conductive through extrinsic doping [15, 39\u2013 41]. These compounds are polar, and for reasonably large temperature ranges there is a positive correlation between resistivity and temperature, even though (strictly speaking) the correlation between resistivity and temperature becomes negative at low temperature. This fact may be why the boundary between doped polar semiconductors and polar metals is frequently blurred by experiment, despite the clear theoretical distinction [36, 42, 43].\nBand Theory\u2014The distinction between a trivial insulator and a metal can be understood using band theory.\n3 For an insulator, the Fermi level is not well-defined, but resides within an energy gap. Therefore, at 0 K, there are no free charge carriers available and \u03c1\u2192\u221e. With increasing temperature, the electrons may thermally populate the conduction band and become available for conduction such that the resistivity decreases (d\u03c1/dT < 0). In metals, the Fermi level is located within a band, giving rise to free charge carriers. As temperature increases, so does resistivity (d\u03c1/dT > 0). At high temperatures (T \u0398D, where \u0398D is the Debye temperature), \u03c1 \u223c T . At low temperatures (T \u0398D) and \u03c1 has four contributions [44]:\n\u03c1(T ) = \u03c10 +AT 2 +BT 5 + CT f exp ( \u2212~\u03c9min kBT ) .\nThe T 2 contribution originates from electron-electron scattering. The T 5 contribution was evaluated by Bloch and Gru\u0308niessen [45, 46] and is due to electron-phonon scattering. The exponential term describes the contribution of electron-phonon umklapp scattering, where \u03c9min is the minimum phonon frequency below which umklapp process are forbidden and f is an empirical parameter. To be considered genuinely metallic, polar metals should exhibit a positive correlation between resistivity and temperature for all T > 0 K. This is exactly what happens for LiOsO3, which shows Fermi liquid-like behavior (\u03c1 \u223c T 2) in its polar phase [7]. With this in mind we can answer the question: At what point does a doped semiconductor become metallic? The threshold to achieve metallic conductivity is determined by the carrier concentration required to make d\u03c1/dT > 0.\nThe ratio d\u03c1/dT is useful for differentiating metals from insulators. However, we note that metallic and insulating phases are limiting situations. In transition metal oxides and other strongly correlated systems \u03c1(T ) exhibits a complex behavior. For instance, the polar oxide Ca3Ru2O7 exhibits metallic conductivity above 48 K, insulating behavior from 48 to 30 K, and shows again metallic transport below 30 K [47]. Even doped ferroelectrics exhibit complex transport properties. In La-doped BaTiO3, \u03c1(T ) shows insulating behavior from 350 to 260 K, metallic transport between 260 and 70 K, and again insulating behavior with weak localization below 70 K [40]. Therefore, the assessment of metal/non-metal status using d\u03c1/dT alone is not an easy task and should be performed in conjunction with other descriptors.\nDrude Definition\u2014Although the DC conductivity would appear to be the natural way to separate metals from insulators, in practice assessing the frequency dependent free-carrier response of a material allows one to treat metals, doped-semiconductors, and insulators on more equal footing [49]. For a perfect crystalline material with non-interacting electrons, the optical conductivity \u03c3 relates the electrical current density due to a spatially uniform transverse electric field as\n\u03c3(\u03c9) = ne 2\u03c4\nm(1\u2212 i\u03c9\u03c4) ,\n\u03c9\n\u03c3( \u03c9\n)\n\u03c30\nmetal insulator doped semiconductor\nFIG. 2. (top) Schematic illustration of the difference in optical conductivity response across materials classes. (bottom) Experimental data from Ref. 48 illustrating the evolution of the optical conductivity of BaTiO3\u2212\u03b4 under oxygen vacancy doping at T \u2248 30 K.\nwhere m is the mass of the carrier (free electron mass or band renormalized mass) and n is the density of carriers (electrons or holes). Fig. 2a shows that for an ideal metal the dc conductivity \u03c30 = ne2\u03c4/m appears as a local maximum of \u03c3(\u03c9) at zero frequency (Drude peak) and then decays with a Lorentzian form due to finite relaxation time \u03c4 . In contrast, \u03c3(\u03c9) = 0 for 0 \u2264 \u03c9 \u2264 Eg in insulators with an optical gap Eg. This Drude definition would categorize some doped FEs with very modest room temperature conductivity as fundamentally closer to insulators, providing some clarity. In addition, the nature of the optical conductivity may vary with temperature [50], allowing the metal-insulator classification to change with temperature\u2014thereby accounting for metal-insulator transitions. However, sufficient doping of a ferroelectric\n4\ncan still lead to optical conductivities that remain nonzero as \u03c9 \u2192 0, but do not reach a local maximum at \u03c9 = 0 (Fig. 2b), which presents a somewhat ambiguous case.\nAnother low-frequency dynamical property, which is of relevance to distinguishing between metals and insulators, is the non-adiabetic Born effective charge (naBEC) [51]. Whereas Born effective charges are typically only welldefined in insulators (as measurements of the changes in dielectric polarization as a function of atomic displacement), naBECs are measurable in metals by considering the current generated in response to atomic motion. Atomic motion in this case is produced optically in a regime such that \u03c9 is much greater than the inverse carrier lifetime (1/\u03c4) while still being much smaller than interband resonances. Effectively, i.e., for materials with long carrier lifetimes, this amounts to \u03c9 \u2192 0 and the naBECs stabilize as the \u201cDrude weight\u201d or the density of free charge carriers available for conduction. As with optical conductivity, \u03c9 \u2192 0 in insulators but reaches a non-zero value in metals. The naBECs, as an analog to BECs, are also advantageous as they allow for characterization of polarizability in metals despite polarization itself not being well-defined.\nOrder of Magnitude\u2014Although for low-frequencies the optical properties of (doped) semiconductors are qualitatively similar (\u03c3 6= 0), they are quantitatively different, because of the difference in carrier masses and densities. At high-frequencies, semiconductors and metals both absorb \u2013 as expected for an insulator with available conduction band states \u2013 owing to interband processes that give rise to finite \u03c3(\u03c9). The frequency crossover at which the behaviors change is given by the plasma frequency \u03c9p, corresponding to a zero in the real part of the dielectric function. Neglecting any damping effects, the plasma frequency can be expressed as \u03c92p = ne2/\u03b5 0m, where \u03b5 = \u221e for a metal in that it includes only electronic contributions from (high energy) interband transitions while an insulator includes both electronic and ionic (static) polarization contributions, i.e., \u03b5 = \u221e+ ionic and ionic > \u221e. As the carrier density increases, the plasma frequency increases. In conventional metals \u03c9p is in the UV region which gives\nrise to the UV reflectivity edge (light of frequency \u03c9 < \u03c9p is reflected). (In practice, this edge can be difficult to assess experimentally due to interband transitions and in some cases can be found just below visible frequencies.) By contrast, the carrier density in doped semiconductors places \u03c9p in the 100s of meV (5-30\u00b5m range) as in n-InSb (Table I) and is highly tunable [52].\nTable I also illustrates the order of magnitude gap in resistivity between doped semiconductors and band metals (as does Fig. 3). The order of magnitude is a meaningful descriptor to aid classification as it similarly is a useful materials selection when deploying materials under application constraints. This distinction should be used when comparing polar metals and doped FEs. However, it is worth noting that some materials would be mislabelled if one uses the order of magnitude of the plasma frequency or resistivity alone. Doped SrTiO3 exhibits extremely low resistivity (including a superconducting transition) but the plasma frequency, even at low temperature, is comparable to other doped semiconductors (\u223c 1.5 \u00d7 103cm\u22121)[53]. Meanwhile, many polar metals exhibit relatively poor conductivity (Fig. 3), belonging to the so-called class of \u201cbad metals.\u201d LiOsO3, for example, has a room temperature resistivity of 15\u00d7 10\u22126 \u2126-m and a plasma frequency on the order of \u223c 102 cm\u22121) [7, 54]. Therefore, as with all other descriptors discussed thus far, order of magnitude is best used in combination with other\n5 criteria when assessing conductivity. Doping Sensitivity Analysis\u2014Although the descriptors above are generally sufficient to clearly differentiate between polar metals and doped FEs, greater clarity may be achieved by considering doping as a perturbation to the initial state of a material and evaluating whether that perturbation has been sufficient to change the material\u2019s classification. We consider the sensitivity of the electronic and crystallographic structure with respect to the perturbation. The effect of doping on electronic structure is direct and immediately distinguishes intrinsic conductivity from extrinsic conductivity. Doping shifts the Fermi level, which in most metals (i.e., excluding semi-metals)\nhas little effect on the effective mass or concentration of the free charge carriers. In FE insulators, on the other hand, doping has an immediate impact, shifting the Fermi level toward a band edge and often inducing defect states, thereby altering the conduction mechanism. This distinction has practical considerations; the transport properties of doped FEs will be more sensitive to changes in the electron chemical potential than those of polar metals.\nAt sufficiently high concentrations, dopant atoms form a partially occupied impurity band which may exhibit metallic conductivity\u2014so-called degenerately doped semiconductors. In this regime, the conductivity of the material is less sensitive to small variations in the concentration of impurity atoms than a traditional doped semiconductor. However, the system should still be considered a perturbation from the pristine state of the semiconductor and can be distinguished from a band metal by both the relatively smaller carrier concentration and the proximity of the Fermi level to a band gap. These distinctions should be clear from electron transport and optical measurements, respectively.\nPredicting the effect of doping on crystal structure is less direct and requires an understanding of the structural driving forces. In the case of polar metals or doped FEs, the primary structural concern is the impact of doping on the inversion-lifting mechanism. Once again, different classes of materials will respond differently to doping as a perturbation. In doped proper FEs, the asymmetric structure is stabilized by a combination of dipole-dipole interactions and covalent bonds which compete with shortrange repulsive forces (which favor a higher symmetry structure) [55\u201357]. Although the addition of charge carriers is not necessarily incompatible with the persistence of broken symmetry, it cannot help but reduce and eventually eliminate the influence of long range dipole-dipole interactions (due to the reduction of the screening length) that cooperatively align the off-centering displacements and may also interfere with bonding, depending on the electronic structure of the material. By contrast, longrange interactions in polar metals are always screened and the atoms providing states at the Fermi level typically display weak coupling with the atoms active in the soft phonon(s) driving the symmetry-break [8]. Nonetheless, for sufficient carrier densities local polar displacements can persist. Therefore, beyond how one simulates dop-\nFIG. 4. (a) Adding correlation to LiOsO3 via increasing the Hubbard U (applied to Os d states) enhances the amplitude of the polar distortion. (inset) Schematic showing how the polar distortion amplitude is defined by the relative long and short distances between Li and Os along the polar axis. (b) Crystal structure of polar (R3c) LiOsO3. (c) Increasing the degree of correlation in cubic BaTiO3 (by applying the Hubbard U to the Ti d states) reduces the critical doping concentration to stabilize the soft \u0393-point phonon mode of the cubic phase. (inset) The crystal structure of cubic (Pm3m) BaTiO3.\ning in these materials, as discussed in Appendix A, it is also imperative to recognize that how we understand the manner in which the atomic structure responds to doping relies intimately on whether the experimental probe interrogates local or average structure [58, 59]. In any case, changes in the Fermi level of doped proper FEs will almost always eventually affect the ground state crystal \u2013 local and average \u2013 structure whereas similar changes in the Fermi level of polar metals are more likely to leave the crystal structure unaltered independent of the experimental probe volume.\nElectron Correlation and Magnetism\u2014Correlation also plays a significant role, both in the realization of polar metals generally and in the potential to drive metalinsulator transitions, often in concert with magnetic ordering. Evidence of the former is found in the number of polar metals which exhibit \u201cbad\u201d metallic transport from electron-electron interactions (Fig. 3). Although it is now well-established that short-range interactions play a dominant role in driving local off-centering in polar metals, reduction of the screening length via correlation may enable longer-range interactions to further enhance the displacement magnitude, or at least allow for longrange coordination of local displacements. It was shown in Ref. 60 that the polar displacements in the predicted polar metal SrEuMo2O6 are enhanced by introduction of additional correlation via a Hubbard U .interaction within DFT. A similar effect is observed when plotting the effective polar amplitude in LiOsO3 as a function of the static U (Fig. 4a). However, just as correlation may help to stabilize or enhance polar displacements, when coupled with magnetic ordering it may also drive Mott-type metal insulator transitions, as found in simulations of LiOsO3/LiNbO3 superlattices [61].\n6 The effect of correlation on a system is also highly dependent on the distortion mechanism. In the absence of magnetism, correlation was shown to reduce the critical free carrier concentration in doped BaTiO3 (Fig. 4c). The more highly correlated Ti d states exhibited weaker covalent bonding with the O p states, favoring the high symmetry structure. Previous studies of correlation in polar metals implied that correlation should assist in decoupling free charges from the symmetry-lowering transition, but the result of BaTiO3 illustrates that the impact of correlation is highly dependent on the driving force behind local off-centering."

            "text": "In this section, we consider existing terminology used to denote polar structures in metallic compounds. Most of these labels were developed to describe insulating polar materials and require re-evaluation in a metallic context. We discuss the fundamental contradiction inherent to some labels and highlight others which transfer more easily. Note that we are restricting our discussion to polar metals, rather than noncentrosymmtric metals more broadly. Noncentrosymmetric space groups may be polar (more than one point invariant under all symmetry operations), chiral (symmetry elements contain only proper rotations), polar-chiral, or nonpolar-achiral. Chiral metals in particular (e.g., ferromagnetic MnSi and other B20 transition metal compounds) are of great interest for realizing skyrmions and other emergent physics [62\u201364], but are not explicitly considered herein. A recent perspective on chiral magnets can be found in Ref. 65.\nContraindicated Properties\u2014 Whereas long-range coordinated off-centering and metallic conductivity were merely thought to be fundamentally incompatible (only to be shown otherwise in the last decade), the switchable polarization of a ferroelectric is, in principle, incapable of coexisting with free charge carriers. A ferroelectric phase is defined as \u201cone in which the spontaneous electric polarization can be reoriented between possible equilibrium directions (determined by the crystallography of the system) by a realizable, appropriately oriented electric field\u201d [66]. Unlike some of the conductivity definitions above, ferroelectricity is an engineering definition; whether a material is ferroelectric can only be confirmed via experimental verification of two criteria: (1) That the polar order occurs at zero electric field (i.e., spontaneous ordering) and (2) the polarization may be switched via external electric field according to the symmetry of the crystal structure. These two criteria lead to the appearance of domain microstructures, a well-known feature of ferroic properties which separates ferroelectrics from other noncentrosymmetric materials [67]. Gauss\u2019s Law prevents the generation of an internal electric field in a metal, thereby screening any attempt to switch the polarization of a polar metal via external electric field and rendering the possibility of criterion (2) null for any reasonably\nconducting materials. \u201cFerroelectric-like\u201d\u2014 Nevertheless, \u201cFerroelectric-like\u201d or \u201cferroelectric\u201d (in quotes) terminology has been used to describe structural phase transitions in polar metals since the first report of its kind in 2013 [7], with many other studies since following suit with this naming convention, either in reference to the material itself or to the inversion-lifting transition (e.g., [21, 30, 40, 68]). Despite the recent history of this convention, describing something as \u201cferroelectric-like\u201d is inherently ambiguous, as it leaves unclear which aspect(s) of ferroelectricity are being replicated. The comparison to FEs implies that the polarization is switchable, which\u2014as noted above\u2014is only true in very specific cases. The intended FE attribute being referred to is the presence of a second-order, structural phase transition that removes the spatial parity operation of inversion. Given the possibility for confusion,we recommend using more precise terminology.\nFerroelectric Bananas\u2014 Electrical hysteresis measurements assess the change in charge Q on a pair of electrodes in contact with a dielectric material upon reversal of the applied bias, such that\nQ = 2PrA+ \u03c3EAt (2)\nwhere Pr, A, t, and E are the remnant electric polarization, area of the electrode contact, thickness of the dielectric, and the applied field, respectively, and \u03c3 is the conductivity. For either a degenerately doped ferroelectric or a polar metal, \u03c3 6= 0 and thus the charge that switches is not due to an electric polarization but the finite conductivity of the material, which is well-understood to be dielectric loss as Pr \u2192 0 [35]. Nonetheless, some reports from the literature have claimed both to have synthesized a polar metal and to have measured a polarization [29, 69]. However, we find these hysteresis loops reported in Ref. 29 to be consistent with examples from Reg. 35, demonstrating that even definitively non-polarizable materials (e.g., bananas) can still exhibit electrical hysteresis. Indeed, the classification of a material as a metal is fundamentally incompatible with a bulk polarization within the adiabatic regime [43]. For these reasons, in principle one should not on the one hand call a material a polar metal and then on the other hand report an electric polarization for it.\nIt is still possible, nonetheless, to experimentally quantify the displacements in polar metals. To this purpose, appropriate techniques such as scanning transmission electron microscopy, near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure, X-ray diffraction, coherent Bragg rod analysis, Raman scattering, and second harmonic generation measurements could be used [16, 31, 70\u201373]. The optical conductivity of noncentrosymmetric metals has been used to evaluate the effect and magnitude of correlation effects [16, 54]. Analysis of the spectral weights produced in those measurements could be used to derive non-adiabatic Born effective charges (naBECs) and provide insight into the role of various ions with regard to the inversion-breaking mechanism [51].\n7\nFerroelasticity\u2014 The mechanical analog of ferroelectricity, a ferroelastic material exhibits two or more domains exhibiting a spontaneous strain, the direction of which may switched by an applied external stress [66, 74]. While ferroelectric and ferroelastic transitions are often accompanied by one another (as is the case in BaTiO3), they may also occur independently, since all that is required for a ferroelastic transition is a change in unit cell shape, which may occur either with or without loss of inversion symmetry (e.g., sodium trihydrogen selenite [75] and lithium niobate [76, 77] both exhibit nonferroelastic ferroelectric phase transitions). Since ferroelasticity is defined without regard to electric fields or charge carriers, there is no fundamental incompatibility between metallicity and ferroelasticity; therefore, ferroelastic metals are an allowed class of materials. However, since they do not necessarily break inversion, we will henceforth restrict our discussion of ferroelastic metals to the scenario where the ferroelastic order is coupled with polar displacements.\nSwitchable Polar Metals\u2014 Nevertheless, recently a number of materials have emerged which use lowdimensionality, anisotropy, or ferroelasticity to demonstrate switchable polar metals [16, 18, 32]. Although it is still difficult to formally define a polarization (P 6= 0) for these compounds, it is possible to reverse the direction of the atomic displacements into an opposite orientation. Perhaps the most widely applicable switching mechanism is ferroelasticity. Although free charges screen external electric fields, strain fields experience no such screening. Although not all polar metals exhibit ferroelastic domains, a change in lattice parameters often accompanies polar distortions, making ferroelastic switching perhaps a viable switching strategy as demonstrated by Lei et al. [16].\nSwitching the polar displacement via electric field was only achieved recently within two-dimensional polar metals that exhibit anisotropic conductivity [18, 32]. With the polar axis oriented perpendicular to the plane, the\nminimal thickness of the conducting layer limits the number of free charges available to screen an applied electric field. This approach skirts the fundamental contraindication between metallicity and switchable polarization by compromising the conductivity of the polar metal along the polar axis, such that switching is enabled along the more insulating direction. We might argue that the ferroelectric properties associated with these compounds are not intrinsic to the materials themselves but rather a product of the architecture and dimensionality of their synthesis.\nWe should note that although it has yet to be realized in experiment, there is a third proposed mechanism toward switching a polar metal. Namely, a thin polar metal film is deposited on a FE with low lattice mismatch. An external electric field switches the FE substrate and the resulting strain switches the polar metal [30, 78]. This approach might be considered a variation of the ferroelastic switching mechanism, as both approaches use the unscreened strain field to switch polarization.\nPiezoelectric Metals\u2014 Piezoelectricity is defined as a change in polarization in response to a mechanical stress, the only prerequisite for which is a lack of an inversion center. However, as was observed when discussing \u201cferroelectric\u201d metals, polarization in a metal is ill-defined. Nonetheless, the Berry curvature effects observed in noncentrosymmetric insulators give rise to analogous properties in metals. Although a static polarization has no meaning in a conductive material, changes in electric polarization are instead measurable as a bulk current, making piezoelectric metals a meaningful designation. Varjas et al. also demonstrated that noncentrosymmetric metals with broken time reversal symmetry should exhibit a magnetopiezoelectric effect (MPE) [9], as was observed recently in antiferromagnetic EuMnBi2 [79]. It is noteworthy that while all ferroelectrics by definition must exhibit piezoelectricity, not all piezoelectrics will be\n8\nferroelectric. This distinction is especially significant in metallic systems as the vast majority of polar metallic system are not switchable, making \u201cpiezoelectric metal\u201d a more accurate and more frequently applicable label than \u201cferroelectric metal\u201d."

            "text": "Summarizing the above considerations and descriptors concerning symmetry and conductivity class (Fig. 5a), we have identified four unique subclasses classes of polar metals (Table II), which we describe in detail next and differentiate from degenerately doped ferroelectrics. In some cases, a material may be classified by more than one designation as indicated by the overlapping intersections in Fig. 5b. We then use this schema to surveying known metallic and acentric compounds in the literature (Table III), which is current as of September 2022 and Fig. 6 shows the distribution of these compounds by polar metal subclass and crystal class. A dynamic version of Table III is maintained at https://mtd.mccormick.northwestern.edu/polarmetals-materials-database/. We invite researchers to submit entries as new materials are discovered by contacting the corresponding author.\nPolar Metal\u2014A polar metal (PM) exhibits a polar crystal structure, identifiable via structural characterization techniques, such as X-Ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, or the observation of properties associated with broken inversion symmetry (i.e., second harmonic generation). A polar metal should also conduct electricity, as determined via a local maximum in its optical conductivity as \u03c9 \u2192 0. Finally, the inversion-lifting mechanism and electron transport should be more or less unaffected by\nsmall changes in electron concentration, i.e., perturbations to the electron chemical potentiatl. Restated, for a material be considered a polar metal, the polar distortion and metallicity should not be contraindicated. Examples include LiOsO3 [7], Ca3Ru2O7 [16, 17], and CePt3Si [80].\nDistortive Polar Metal\u2014A distortive polar metal (DPM) is a subclass of polar metals, meeting all of the above criteria while also exhibiting an inversion-symmetry lifting phase transition. This eliminates the need for misleading \u201cferroelectric-like\u201d terminology and its derivatives by highlighting the intended comparison to a ferroelectric phase transition.\nThe disortive polar metal subclass also separates polar metals exhibiting phase transitions from polar metals in which inversion is lifted via compositional order and nominally absent for a broad temperature range. This is a meaningful distinction, both from a fundamental physics perspective as well as an application-driven perspective, as the presence of a phase transition implies opportunities to tune physical properties in ways that would not be possible in polar metals that do not undergo a phase tran-\n9 sition. Structural phase transitions in polar metals have been experimentally observed via second-order discontinuities in electronic transport, heat capacity, magnetic susceptibility, dielectric response, second harmonic generation, and with scattering and diffraction techniques [7, 40, 48, 72, 81\u201383]. Within distortive polar metals\u2014as is true with ferroelectrics\u2014the phase transition may be displacive, order-disorder, or exhibit characteristics of both. Examples of distortive polar metals include LiOsO3 (primarily order-disorder) [7, 31, 72, 73] and Pb2CoOsO6 (primarily displacive) [81]. Examples of non-distortive or compositional polar metals include intermetallics such as CePt3Si [80] and ErPdBi [84].\nIn differentiating between polar metals that exhibit a structural phase transition and those that do not, a key feature of potential technological use in distortive polar metals is their domain structure. Metallic domains walls in ferroelectrics like BiFeO3 [85] and YMnO3 [86] are actively investigated for use as non-destructive resistance-based memory devices [87, 88]. Similarly, in Ca3Ru2O7, both charged and uncharged domain walls were shown to exist\u2014each associated with different electrical conductivity\u2014implying potential application in charge-mediated memory devices as well [70]. However, under the current classification scheme, Ca3Ru2O7 would not be classified as a distortive polar metal because the temperature at which it would undergo a structural phase transition to recover centrosymmetry exceeds the melting temperature of the compound.\nA number of polar metals both exhibit a local ordering mechanism and fail to exhibit an inversion-lifting structural phase transition. Ca3Ru2O7 is one such example, in which the polar order is derived from trilinear\ncoupling between octahedral rotations but the thermal energy required to overcome this coupling and achieve a centrosymmetric structure is greater than the melting temperature of the compound [16, 17]. Therefore, materials which exhibit local-ordering mechanisms similar to those observed in distortive polar metals may be called \u201cpseudodistortive polar metals.\u201d This terminology acknowledges that such materials share important characteristics with distortive metals while remaining distinct due to their lack of an ordering transition.\nAnisotropic Ferroelectric Metal\u2014An anisotropic ferroelectric metal (AFM) meets the structural criteria for a distortive polar metal but exhibits limited conductivity along the polar axis, allowing for observable switching of the polar displacement direction via external electric field. \u201cAnisotropic\u201d is meant to call attention to the fact that it the anisotropic conductivity tensor and direction of the polar distortions are in transverse orientations. As a consequence, these materials can be deployed in suitable device geometries to sidestep the fundamentally contraindicated relationship between field-switchable polarization and conductivity. Ferroelectricity is not, and by definition cannot, be an intrinsic property of a metal, but low-dimensional conductors provides a design strategy to achieve high electrically anisotropy such that the polarization becomes switchable by external electric field. Examples include WTe [18] and Bi5Ti5O17 [32]. Note that polar metals whose polar order is switched via strain are not classified as anisotropic ferroelectric metals, as this switching mechanism does not require limiting the fundamental relationship between external electric field and free charge carriers.\n10\nTABLE III \u2013 continued from previous page Composition SG Tc Tsc TM Class Digital Object Identifier (DOI) La2Ti2O7 P21 P

polar metal (EPM) must meet each of the structural and electronic criteria of a polar metal (i.e., polar structure, metallic optical conductivity, robust polar distortion in the presence of perturbations to the Fermi level). However, a polar metal is deemed extrinsic if the metallic electron transport is a result of perturbations to the pristine state of the material. The number of charge carriers or conductivity of an extrinsic polar metal is determined by the doping mechanisms, such as chemical substitution, interstitials, vacancies, photodoping, and electrostatic gating. This distinction has consequences for application contexts in which sensitivity to small changes in chemical potential either positively or detrimentally impacts performance. In any case, the broken inversion symmetry in an extrinsic polar metal persists over the doping ranges explored. Examples include Nb-doped PbTiO3 [12] and doped SrTiO3 [13, 14].\nInterfacial Polar Metal\u2014When the two fundamental criteria for a polar metal exist only at the interface between two compounds, we define the resulting composite material an interfacial polar metal (IPM). Interfacial polar metals exhibit some similarity to both anisotropic ferroelectric metals and extrinsic polar metals, but can be fundamentally distinguished from both. Whereas anisotropic ferroelectric metals often exhibit low-dimensional electronic structures distinct from bulk polar metals, interfacial polar metals emerge out of the heterojunction created by interfacing two materials which in the bulk are either non-metallic, non-polar, or both. In this sense, either the conductivity, the broken inversion symmetry, or both should be exclusively limited to the interface. In addi-\ntion, whereas anisotropic ferroelectric metals must be switchable, interfacial polar metals may or may not be switchable.\nWhen the interfacial polar metal forms at the interface of two doped semiconductors, it may be considered a subcategory of extrinsic polar metals. However, if no doping is required or if one of the two materials is a bulk conductor, then the conductivity of the interface is no longer considered to be extrinsically derived. The most well-known interfacial polar metals are grown as perovskite superlattices, e.g., BaTiO3/SrTiO3/LaTiO3 [89], LaAlO3/BaSr0.8TiO3/SrTiO3 [90], and doped LaFeO3/YFeO3 [91].\nDegenerately Doped Ferroelectric\u2014A degenerately doped ferroelectric (DDF) meets the same structural criteria as the other categories, but the structural transition is detrimentally impacted by perturbations to the Fermi level from a pristine insulating state. In such a material, the polar order and the conduction mechanism are contraindicated, which both implies a fundamentally different relationship between the polar structure and the conduction mechanism than in the above categories. These differences will affect how degenerately doped ferroelectrics are used in devices, e.g., some are proposed for thermoelectric applications [92\u201395], whereas the higher carrier density in polar metals would make them less well suited for these energy devices. Furthermore, the pristine undoped material is a good dielectric that exhibits a spontaneous and switchable polarization. Nonetheless, if degenerately doping a ferroelectric is seen as a pathway to accessing the many desirable properties of a polar metal, it should be performed in a context where careful\n13\ncontrol of the chemical potential is possible and practical. The conductivity threshold required to be deemed \u201cdegenerately doped\u201d rather than \u201cmetallic\u201d is somewhat ambiguous, but a minimum criteria should be \u03c3 6= 0 as \u03c9 \u2192 0. The primary example of a degenerately doped ferroelectric is doped BaTiO3 [15, 48, 56]."

            "heading": "B. Classification Caveats",
            "text": "Despite the consideration put into the above classification scheme, there remain materials which prove difficult to categorize into a single class. The majority of such cases involve materials which undergo significant changes in conductivity or displacive mode dynamics as a result of changes in their environment. In most cases, it is simplest to describe a material as moving between categories as a function of some perturbation. For example, a polar material exhibiting a metal-insulator transition would transition from a polar metal to ferroelectric [61, 96, 97].\nAnother unique case is found in materials which exhibit a polar displacement that is enhanced as a consequence of doping an initially insulating material, as predicted in Sr3Sn2O7 and various binary metal oxides [98, 99]. Strictly speaking, assuming doping occurs at such level so as to pass the Drude criterion for conductivity, it would be tempting to categorize Sr3Sn2O7 as a degenerately doped ferroelectric, since the polar distortion is sensitive to changes at the Fermi level and the pristine state is ferroelectric. However, since polar order and conductivity are clearly not fundamentally contraindicated in this compound, it may be wise to reclassify as an extrinsic polar metal. Such a classification would be made easier if the polar mode amplitude plateaus under doping to reach a steady state, relatively insensitive to changes at the Fermi level. It is also worth noting that the material has not yet been synthesized and characterized in experiment and we may discover that the real material behaves differently than anticipated.\nFinally, although we referenced 2D polar metals in the \u201cAnisotropic Ferroelectric Metals\u201d category, it should be noted that a low-dimensional polar metal may have applications beyond switchability under external electric field. For example, 2D polar metallic In and Ga thin films exhibit remarkable second harmonic generation due to their unique bonding environment and fine control of the crystal lattice [100, 101]. These materials cannot be described as ferroelectrics, and would be considered simply polar metals under our current scheme, although the strong coupling between thin film morphology and crystal structure implies a similarity to \u201cInterfacial Polar Metals\u201d and may warrant a separate category entirely."

            "heading": "IV. OUTLOOK",
            "text": "The outlook for polar metals research has never held more possibility. The number of publications in the re-\nsearch space continues to climb and we have made great strides in determining the necessary relationship between electronic and crystallographic structure to enable their coexistence. Although there remain some unanswered questions (e.g. is \u2018weak-coupling\u2019 a necessary condition or merely a useful design principle?), there are also opportunities to significantly broaden the polar metallic design space:\n\u2022 Polar metals requiring new subclass designations may combine multiple orders or enhanced functions, e.g., magnetism and strong electron-electron interactions can enable magnetochiral anisotropy with nonreciprocal electrical transport.\n\u2022 Polar metals violating the weak-coupling principle would broaden the materials landscape and bring control routes to physical properties using non-conjugate fields.\nBeginning with magnetic polar metals, there are many known acentric conductors with magnetic ordering temperature (across all of the above categories), including the following: en-CoS [19], Pb2CoOsO6 [81], Pb2NiOsO6 [102], tri-color superlattices BaTiO3/SrTiO3/LaTiO3 [89], Ca3Ru2O7 [17], and more. The relationship between magnetic ordering in these materials and their designation as polar metals varies. For example, Jiao et al. describe separating polar metals with magnetic ordering temperatures into \u201ctype-I\u201d and \u201ctype-II\u201d categories depending on the strength of the coupling between magnetic and polar orders, with Pb2CoOsO6 being an example of a \u201ctype-II\u201d magnetic polar metal [81]. By contrast, the magnetic ordering predicted in SrCaRu2O6 is not expected to couple to the inversion-lifting distortion [8], or one might note the insensitivity of the polar transition in doped SrTiO3 to the presence of magnetic doping and isovalent substitution as an example of \u201ctype-I\u201d behavior [103]. Still, we may describe other categories, including magnetically-driven metal-insulator transitions in Pb2CaOsO6 [104] and Bsite substituted Ca3Ru2O7[105\u2013107] (in which case the magnetic and transport properties are highly sensitive to dilute concentrations and dependent on the substituting species\u2014Mn, Ti, or Fe). Such sub-categorization according to magnetic properties helps describe fundamentally different physical phenomena, but may be well-suited to more detailed investigations which may coexist with the classification scheme presented above.\nThe \u2018weak-coupling hypothesis\u2019 states that in order for broken inversion and metallic conductivity to coexist there must be limited coupling between electrons at the Fermi level and the phonon(s) responsible for driving the symmetry-breaking transition [8]. If polar metals exhibiting strong coupling between the Fermi level and the structural distortion were to be discovered, they may deserve separate categorization as well. Although TiGaO3 has been predicted as a compound that might violate the weak-coupling hypothesis [30], it be would hasty to separately categorize such a material prior to experimental\n14\nsynthesis and characterization. We recently computed the decomposition enthalpy of TiGaO3 to be about - 1 eV/f.u., making it unlikely to be realized in experiment. Studying a series of related ABO3 compounds (A = Ti, Zr; B = Al, Ga, In) revealed that while each exhibits a dynamically stable polar phase driven by displacements of the A-site cation (which also contributes to the Fermi level), none have a decomposition enthalpy smaller in magnitude than -0.8 eV/f.u. As was the case with Sr3Sn2O7, it seems prudent to primarily concern ourselves with the classification of known compounds, as the synthesis of exotic predicted compounds may reveal features that aid in their classification. Alternatively, we may yet discover factors that prevent the synthesis of acentric conductors that challenge our classification scheme. In the mean time, it is incumbent on theoretical and computational materials scientists to examine the stability of their predicted compounds before sharing their results [108]. At the same time, the high number of superconducting polar metals (Table III) implies that perhaps the description of weak coupling between crystallographic and electronic orders in polar metals is not entirely accurate. There is certainly evidence of a coupled relationship in degenerately doped superconducting ferroelectrics SrTiO3 [13, 14] and BaTiO3 [109]. The apparent connection between superconductivity and polar metals (and the associated implications for coupling between the two orders) warrants further investigation.\nAccompanying the advent of 2D materials has been a recent interest in the emergent phenomena that occur when two sheets of material are stacked on top of one another; Moire\u0301 heterostructures like those in the famous \u201cmagic angle\u201d graphene are being explored in a variety of van der Waals materials [89, 110\u2013113]. However, work thus far has exclusively focused on small-bandgap semiconductors and semimetals. In addition, \u201ctwisting\u201d typically occurs mechanically and continuously. Concurrently, in the past year we have seen a significant increase in the number of predicted and synthesized two-dimensional polar metals [18, 32, 114\u2013117]. We see an opportunity to significantly broaden the phase space of both topologically non-trivial materials and acentric conductors by considering two dimensional metals and scalable, discrete stacking mechanisms.\nMetallic correlated transition metal dichalcogenides and halides have yet to be investigated in Moire\u0301 heterostructures. Noting that interlayer twisting at most angles breaks inversion symmetry, this presents a pathway for a new class of noncentrosymmetric metals, which may facilitate the generation of tunable charge density waves as well as topological conduction mechanisms and create exotic opportunities to support new physics. However, the number of metallic 2D transition metal dichalcogenides is limited, motivating an interest in looking beyond van der Waals stacking (which requires mechanical stacking amidst a continuum of possible twist angles) toward hybrid organic-inorganic materials that can be directly assembled [118, 119].\nAs evidenced by Table III, there are a great many predicted compounds; experimental verification of predicted polar metallic dynamics is a pressing need. In addition, the search for compounds that violate weak-coupling continues to be of interest and may require expanding the field into new structure families. Finally, the properties and applications of polar metals are not yet fully appreciated. Recent work on topological phonons indicates that polar metals are ideal candidates to host this recently described phenomenon [120], while the potential for polar metals to impact the fields of photovoltaics [121], energy harvesting [122, 123], catalysis [124], microelectronic [125\u2013127], optoelectronic, photonic and plasmonic devices [100, 101, 128\u2013134], and quantum information systems [135] remains largely untapped."

            "text": "The background charge approach has become the de facto tool for use in studying the effects of electrostatic doping on solid state materials [33, 56, 91, 136, 137]. This method works by changing the number of electrons present in an electronic structure simulation, while providing an additional homogeneous background charge to maintain charge-balance. The background charge approximation has become popular in doping simulations because it allows one to use smaller unit cells than in substitutional or vacancy-doping simulations and because it allows one to separate the effects of changes in electronic structure from the distortions which accompany real chemical dopants. This is an attractive combination of attributes when studying the interplay between free charge carriers and the polar distortion active in ferroelectrics.\nThe background-charge method is frequently used both to investigate fundamental relationships and to design polar metals [12, 91, 136, 137]. This approximation, however, has consequences which do not always translate to physical systems. These include, but are not limited to: (i) Changes in volume; (ii) Abrupt changes in conductivity; and (iii) Homogeneous changes to electronic and crystallographic structure. Some of these problems are linked to the use of periodic density functional theory (DFT) as a simulation method in general, e.g., (3) can be challenging to avoid while using periodic boundary conditions, and all have been previously observed, but their shortcomings have been amplified by widespread application of the background charge technique to doped\n15\nFEs. Despite its limitations, the background-charge approximation remains an extremely valuable method of exploring the effects of doping on electronic and crystallographic structure. The consequences of using this approximation instead of more realistic substitution or vacancy-based doping simulations, however, should be acknowledged to avoid arriving at inappropriate conclusions about the effect of doping in semiconductors and in doped ferroelectrics in particular."

            "heading": "1. Changes in volume",
            "text": "The homogeneous background charge introduced in electrostatic doping simulations produces unintended consequences for the volume of the semiconductor being studied. The effective \u2018pressure\u2019 resulting from the additional electrons and associated background is ill-defined, resulting in inconsistent consequences depending on the choice of DFT software [33]. It follows naturally that this arbitrary treatment of volume leads to results that deviate significantly from experiment. For example, Iwazaki et al. showed that volume increase due to electrostatic doping simulations via the background charge method in BaTiO3 dramatically overpredicted volume changes as compared to experimental substitutional doping [34]. Volume discrepancies dramatically impact properties, including the stability of the crystal structure, as volume is closely tied to the strength of interatomic forces and hence phonon frequencies. Simulations of soft phonon modes in BaTiO3 under electrostatic doping with and without volume relaxation produce significantly different critical doping thresholds [56]. If the volume difference between polar and non-polar phases is substantial, then the volume changes induced by this method will intrinsically favor high or low symmetry structures depending on the relative volume [34, 91], obfuscating the changes induced by doping. Therefore, it is recommended that electrostatic doping via the compensating background charge approximation be performed with fixed volume. Volume relaxation may only be used when simulating substitutional, interstitial, or vacancy-based doping. Even in those cases, the dopant concentration should be considered when performing volume relaxations."

            "text": "In the pristine case, ferroelectric insulators are easily differentiated from metals, both computationally (i.e. gapped band structure) and experimentally (optical conductivity approaches zero at low frequency). Next, the addition of charge carries can be achieved through chemical means (dopants) or electrostatic gating. Upon chemical substitution, defect states are introduced into the electronic structure of a semiconductor, allowing for modest conductivity due to thermally excited charge carriers occupying the defect states. This may lead to the material\nCB VB\nenergy\nDOS\nEF EF'\nCB VB\nenergy\nDOS\nEF EF'\nIB\nFIG. A1. Schematic illustration of the effect of doping on the electronic structure under the background-charge technique (top) and under more realistic substitutional doping mechanisms involving the formation of an impurity band (bottom)\nexhibiting metal-like temperature-dependent resistivity (i.e. positive slope) away from 0 K, but as temperature is reduced the thermally activated charge carriers are eventually frozen out and resistivity increases. This is reflected in the optical conductivity (\u03c30), which still heads to 0 at low frequency (Fig. 2a).\nUpon additional doping, an impurity band may form, transforming a degenerately doped semiconductor into a bad metal with low mobility from impurity scattering [138, 139], as shown schematically in Fig. A1. In this case, the material will exhibit exclusively metallic characteristics, as the impurity band produces a finite \u03c30 as \u03c9 \u2192 0, which can lead to the apparent closure of the gap with sufficient doping as low frequency spectra weight appears (Fig. 2a).\nThis gradual evolution in conductivity under doping, accompanied by the formation of an impurity band, is not well-described using the background charge method to approximate doping. In real semiconductors, doping shifts the Fermi level up or down within the band gap, but often not to a degree sufficient to push the Fermi level into either the valence or conduction band (Fig. A1). With the background charge method, even a highly dilute concentration of additional electrons (or holes) is sufficient to place the Fermi level within a band, making the system metallic far below even the electron concentration given by the Mott criterion (n1/3c a0 \u2248 0.25) for free electrons. Furthermore, the undoped band structure remains more or less intact, precluding the possibility of changes to the electronic structure due to impurity bands or polaron formation (Fig. A1). This simplification obscures the complex reality of changes to the electronic structure that\n16\naccompany chemical dopants. These changes are highly dependent on choice of starting material and doping method (substitution, vacancy, electrostatic, etc.). The critical charge carrier concentration (n\u2217) for conductivity in BaTiO3 alone varies considerably across several doping mechanisms [15, 40, 140], all of which are significantly higher than n\u2217 for SrTiO3 [141]. The background charge method is not able to account for these differences and therefore may lead to misleading conclusions about the ease of altering the conductivity of a material. It may come closest to approximating electrostatic gating, as this field-driven method typically does not generate an impurity band. However, it still ignores charge localization mechanisms, as will be discussed in the next section."

            "heading": "3. Homogeneous changes to crystallographic and electronic structure",
            "text": "Below the impurity band formation limit, or under electrostatic gating, the carriers will either be homogeneously or inhomogeneously distributed at the nanoscale. At present, nearly all DFT calculations make the assumption that carriers are homogeneously distributed, and by construction the simulations result in a metallic electronic structure. Whether or not this model accurately captures the experimental situation requires attention, as recent extensions of semiconductor doping principles to transition metal compounds show that homogeneous distributions are often the exception rather than the rule [142].\nFor the inhomogeneous case, we anticipate nanoscale phase segregation to occur in close analogy to what happens across metal-insulator phase transitions in complex oxides, e.g., VO2 [143]. Here doping leads to domains\nthat are either metallic or insulating and local structures that are centric and noncentrosymmetric, respectively. In other words, the regions that are metallic recover inversion while inversion symmetry remains lifted in the insulating regions. This electronic- and parity-symmetry phase separation is supported by recent studies on BaTiO3 and SrTiO3 [140, 141]. Indeed, BaTiO3 is much more difficult to make metallic than SrTiO3 [141] with the key difference being the lattice dynamical properties; BaTiO3 is a softmode semiconducting ferroelectric whereas SrTiO3 is an incipient ferroelectric with a highly dilute superconducting transition. In practice this means that long range order quickly breaks down in doped BaTiO3, as the driving force for local off-centering persists leading to a network of disordered insulating octahedra separated by centrosymmetric metallic clusters hosting pseudo-localized free charge carriers. By contrast, under similar doping conditions, the more regular octahedra of SrTiO3 enter a metallic\u2014and subsequently superconducting\u2014state. SrTiO3 is not immune to nanodomain formation [144], but charge does not localize as easily. This highlights the fact that the experimental structure may exhibit electronic structure heterogeneities in real-space with regard to either the electronic structure and/or crystal structure.\nMeanwhile, nearly all DFT calculations assume homogeneous doping. This is unavoidable to a certain extent, due to the prohibitive cost of simulating the large supercells necessary to capture nanodomain structures on the mesoscale. However, the background charge method further enforces uniformity, as the added charge carriers are distributed among the bands closest to the Fermi level while a homogeneous compensating background charge is added for charge balance. This makes it very challenging to simulate localization or polaron formation, let alone account for multiple phases.\n\u2217 hickoxyoung@roanoke.edu; Present Address: Department of Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics, Roanoke College, Salem, Virginia 24153, USA \u2020 danilo.puggioni@northwestern.edu \u2021 jrondinelli@northwestern.edu [1] P.
