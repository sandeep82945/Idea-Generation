    "abstractText": "Defect engineering is considered an effective method to adjust the photocatalytic properties of materials. In this work, we synthesized the vacancy-rich ZnO rods with (100) planes via the melamine-assisted thermal activation method. A high concentration of oxygen vacancies was successfully introduced into non-polar oriented ZnO rods by calcination. The effect of oxygen vacancy on the photocatalytic properties of non-polar-oriented ZnO rods was investigated. Raman and XPS spectra revealed the formation of oxygen vacancies in the ZnO. The results showed that the growth habit and defects in ZnO can be controlled by changing the ratio of ZnO to melamine. The higher ratio of ZnO to melamine led to more amounts of (100) planes and oxygen vacancies in ZnO, and it reached the highest when the ratio was 1.2:1. When the ratio was 1.2:1, ZnO exhibited a high methyl orange degradation rate (95.8%). The differences in oxygen vacancy concentration and non-polar planes were responsible for the improvement in photocatalytic performance. ZnO exhibited good stability and regeneration capacity. After recycling four times, the degradation rate was still at 92%. Using the same method, vacancy-rich \u03b1-Fe2O3 was obtained. This work could offer a new and simple strategy for designing a photocatalyst with oxygen vacancies.",

Compared with other preparation methods, calcination has the advantages of simple operation, lower requirements of equipment, increases in molecular/ion activity and the provision of a special environment to form defects, thus affecting the crystal growth kinetics. All of these advantages are beneficial to obtain materials with different morphologies, structures and properties. Upon calcination, a systematic morphology, structure and property can be monitored by changing temperature, time, or atmosphere, or adding additives [1\u20133]. For example, with an increase in calcination temperature (from 300 \u25e6C to 400 \u25e6C), CuII0.4FeII0.6FeIII2O4 nanomaterials changed from an irregular morphology to needle-like structure, and the photocatalytic performance was significantly improved [2]. During the calcination process, less-reactive monoclinic \u03b1-spodumene was converted to more-reactive tetragonal \u03b2-spodumene, which resulted in a higher lithium grade and recovery [3]. Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a unique nontoxic material with high photocatalytic activity and chemical stability [4], which shows strong face-dependent and defect-dependent photocatalytic activity [5,6]. Many researches have focused on how to form specified faces and defects in the structure of ZnO to improve its photocatalytic performance. Calcination is an effective way to obtained ZnO with defects and orientation growth. For example, defects such as oxygen vacancies were generated by annealing ZnO under oxygen-deficient conditions or in a reductive environment [7]. The growth habit of ZnO could be modified during\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5329. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28145329 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5329 2 of 16\nthe calcination process by introducing plasma [8], electrospinning [9], or additives [10]. Among this research, ZnO with polar (001) planes was easily obtained. However, it has been reported that ZnO with non-polar planes could exhibit higher stability and properties. For example, ZnO with non-polar (100) planes showed higher gas-sensing properties compared to that with polar (001) planes [11]. Therefore, the performance of ZnO is expected to improve by combining defect engineering with orientation growth. Though a few studies reported the formation of defects in non-polar-oriented ZnO rods, a more straightforward and efficient way to create defects is still urgently needed [12]. In this work, non-polar-oriented ZnO rods with oxygen vacancies created by a melamine-assisted thermal activation method were obtained. The growth habit and defects in ZnO were controlled by changing the ratio of ZnO to melamine. Simply calcining ZnO with melamine introduced oxygen vacancies in the structure of ZnO and realized the orientation growth of ZnO rods. The effect of oxygen vacancies on the photocatalytic property of non-polar-oriented ZnO rods was investigated. We also prepared vacancy-rich \u03b1-Fe2O3 using the same method."

A single phase of ZnO with a hexagonal structure was obtained after reaction at 120 \u25e6C (sample ZnO-H, Figure 1a, JCPDS No. 36-1451). For comparison, melamine was calcined at 520 \u25e6C for 4 h, which resulted in the formation of g-C3N4 with a hexagonal phase (sample MW, JCPDS file No. 87-1526). After calcining ZnO-H at 520 \u25e6C with and without melamine (labeled as sample ZnO-X and sample ZW, respectively), all samples showed the same hexagonal structure of ZnO (Figure 1a), but the crystallinity increased. After calcining ZnO with melamine, no diffraction peaks for g-C3N4 were detected, which confirmed that there were no significant changes in the crystal structure. As the ratio of ZnO to melamine increased, the peak intensity increased gradually, indicating an enhancement in the crystallinity. In general, materials with higher crystallinity show better photocatalytic activity and stability since the increase in crystallinity could decrease the number of recombination centers for photoinduced charges, leading to efficient charge migration [13]. Therefore, ZnO-X with higher crystallinity is expected to show better photocatalytic activity.

It can be further proved by the change in lattice parameters. Based on the equations (Equations (1)\u2013(3), which were derived from Equations (S1) and (S2)), the lattice parameters (a and c) and the cell unit volume (V) were calculated using the lattice spacing values of (100) and (002) planes. The values obtained are summarized in Table 1. The slight decrease in the lattice parameters was observed as the ratio increased (Table 1 and Figure S1). Compared to ZW, the peak intensity and the tendency of oriented growth of ZnO rods in ZnO-X were increased (Figure S1), indicating that the addition of melamine changed the growth habit of ZnO rods. The relatively high intensity of (100) peaks was obtained when the ZnO/melamine ratio was 1.2:1.\nThe average crystallite sizes of samples were calculated using Scherrer\u2019s formula (Equation (4)) and the Williamson\u2013Hall model (W-H model, Equations (5) and (6), Figure 2) [15].\na = \u03bb/( \u221a\n3 sin \u03b8(100)) (1)\nc = \u03bb/sin\u03b8(002) (2)\nV = \u221a 3a2c/2 (3)\nD = 0.9\u03bb/\u03b2Dcos\u03b8 (4)\n\u03b2cos\u03b8 = 0.9\u03bb/D + 4\u03b5sin\u03b8 (5)\n\u03b2 = \u03b2D + \u03b2\u03b5 (6)\nwhere \u03bb, \u03b8, D, \u03b2D, \u03b5 and \u03b2\u03b5 represent the wavelength of the CuKa radiation, Bragg angle, crystallite size, full-width at the half maximum intensity (FWHM) of the diffraction line, strain and the strain-induced broadening of the diffraction line. The values of \u03b5 were also obtained from the slope of \u03b2cos\u03b8-4sin\u03b8 plots (Table 1). It can be seen that the sizes of samples calculated with Scherrer\u2019s formula are smaller than those of the W-H model (Table 1). The reason is that the strain-induced broadening effect is excluded in Scherrer\u2019s formula. After calcining ZnO with or without melamine, the values of \u03b5 in samples decreased and the sizes of ZnO increased, confirming the improvement of crystallinity of ZnO. Sample ZW exhibited a hexagonal rod-like shape with a size of about 200 nm (Figure 3a). When annealing ZnO-H with melamine in air, all ZnO-X showed a similar hexagonal rodlike shape (Figure 3b\u2013d), while the sizes of the ZnO rods decreased. TEM, SAED and EDS analyses were employed to investigate the microstructures of ZnO calcined with and without melamine (Figure 4). Both ZW and ZnO-1.2 showed a rod-like shape. The SAED patterns of a single rod revealed the crystalline nature of ZW and ZnO-1.2 (insets in Figure 4a,b). The SAED pattern of ZnO-1.2 could be indexed to the (002) and (100)\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5329 4 of 16\nreflection of ZnO, while that for ZW was indexed to the (002) and (110) reflection.

(a) the wide-scan XPS spectrum, the high-resolution XPS spectra of (b) N 1s, (c) Zn 2p, (d) O 1s and ( ) C 1s.\nThe high-resolution XPS pectrum of Zn 2p for ZnO-X displayed two peaks at 1021.5 eV and 1044.6 eV, corresponding to the Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 of ZnO [16]. The difference in binding energy between Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2 states was 23.1 eV, which matched well with the standard value (23.0 eV) (Figure 5c). For ZW, two peaks appeared at around 1022.5 eV (Zn 2p3/2) and 1045.6 eV (Zn 2p1/2) with a similar energy distance (23.1 eV). It is worth noting that the shift of the peak for ZnO-X toward lower binding energy confirmed an increase in the electron density of the Zn2+ species, which resulted from the formation of oxygen vacancies in ZnO-X [17].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5329 6 of 16\nThe high-resolution XPS spectrum of O 1s for ZnO-X was fitted with two peaks, labeled as OL and OV and located at 530.15 eV and 531.71 eV, respectively (Figure 5d). The OL peak and OV peak can be assigned to the lattice oxygen of ZnO and oxygen ions in the oxygen-deficient regions caused by oxygen vacancies [18,19]. However, the XPS spectrum for ZW was only fitted with one peak at 530.15 eV (OL), and no peak for OV was observed. It is believed that the peak area ratio of OV/(OL + OV) reveals the concentration of oxygen vacancies [16,18]. OV/(OL + OV) was 38.5% for ZnO-X, which suggested the formation of oxygen vacancies in ZnO-X. The Zn/O atomic ratio in ZnO could be larger than the stoichiometric value (Zn:O = 1:1), owing to the formation of interstitial ions or ions vacancies [18]. According to the XPS analyses, the Zn/OL atomic ratio was 1.19:1 for ZnO-X, and oxygen vacancies in the surface of ZnO-X were 16%, which confirmed the formation of oxygen vacancies for ZnO-X, similar with reported values [20,21]. The high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s (Figure 5e) were fitted with three peaks, located at 284.8 eV, 286.4 eV and 288.6 eV for ZnO-X as well as 284.6 eV, 285.9 eV and 288.5 eV for ZW, which were attributed to C\u2013C, C\u2013O and C=O, respectively [19,22]. Compared to ZW, the peak of C 1s in ZnO-X shifted slightly toward higher binding energy. The peak intensity ratio of 1288.6 eV/(1284.8 eV + 1286.4 eV + 1288.6 eV) for ZnO-X (16.42%) was larger than that of ZW (8.96%). The light yellow color of ZnO-X further indicated the presence of C in ZnO-X after ZnO-H was calcined with melamine. Raman spectroscopy was used to study the molecular vibration and chemical structure, which revealed the defects in ZnO. Compared to MW (Figure 6), no peaks of g-C3N4 were observed for ZnO-X. Several peaks for ZnO were observed (Figure 4a,b). The peaks at 97.9 cm\u22121 and 438.3 cm\u22121 were attributed to the E2 vibration mode of ZnO with a hexagonal structure [16]. The peaks at 203.7 cm\u22121, 331.6 cm\u22121, 381.5 cm\u22121 and 1150.9 cm\u22121 were assigned to the molecular vibration arising from zero-boundary phonons 2-TA(M), 2E2, A1 (TO) and 2E1(LO) modes, respectively [22]. The peak around 585.5 cm\u22121 was assigned to the E1(LO) mode, owing to the contribution of oxygen vacancies in ZnO. Compared to ZW, ZnO-X showed relatively higher intensity of the peak located at 585.5 cm\u22121, which revealed that ZnO-X has more defects than ZW.\nolec les\u00a0 ,\u00a0 ,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 6\u00a0 of\u00a0 16\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a05.\u00a0(a)\u00a0the\u00a0wide-scan\u00a0XPS\u00a0spectrum,\u00a0the\u00a0high-resolution\u00a0XPS\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0(b)\u00a0N\u00a01s,\u00a0(c)\u00a0Zn\u00a02p,\u00a0(d)\u00a0 O\u00a01s\u00a0and\u00a0(e)\u00a0C\u00a01s.\u00a0\nRaman\u00a0spectroscopy\u00a0was\u00a0used\u00a0to\u00a0study\u00a0the\u00a0molecular\u00a0vibration\u00a0and\u00a0chemical\u00a0structure,\u00a0which\u00a0revealed\u00a0the\u00a0defects\u00a0in\u00a0ZnO.\u00a0Compared\u00a0to\u00a0MW\u00a0(Figure\u00a06),\u00a0no\u00a0peaks\u00a0of\u00a0g-C3N4\u00a0 ere\u00a0observed\u00a0for\u00a0ZnO-X.\u00a0Several\u00a0peaks\u00a0for\u00a0ZnO\u00a0were\u00a0observed\u00a0(Figure\u00a04a,b).\u00a0The\u00a0peaks\u00a0 at\u00a097.9\u00a0cm\u22121\u00a0and\u00a0438.3\u00a0cm\u22121\u00a0were\u00a0attributed\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0E2\u00a0vibration\u00a0mode\u00a0of\u00a0ZnO\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0hexagonal\u00a0structure\u00a0[16].\u00a0The\u00a0peaks\u00a0at\u00a0203.7\u00a0cm\u22121,\u00a0331.6\u00a0cm\u22121,\u00a0381.5\u00a0cm\u22121\u00a0and\u00a01150.9\u00a0cm\u22121\u00a0were\u00a0 assigned\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0molecular\u00a0vibration\u00a0arising\u00a0from\u00a0zero-boundary\u00a0phonons\u00a02-TA(M),\u00a02E2,\u00a0A1\u00a0 (TO)\u00a0and\u00a02E1(LO)\u00a0modes,\u00a0respectively\u00a0[22].\u00a0The\u00a0peak\u00a0around\u00a0585.5\u00a0cm\u22121\u00a0was\u00a0assigned\u00a0to\u00a0 the\u00a0E1(LO)\u00a0mode,\u00a0owing\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0contribution\u00a0of\u00a0oxygen\u00a0vacancies\u00a0in\u00a0ZnO.\u00a0Compared\u00a0to\u00a0 ZW,\u00a0ZnO-X\u00a0showed\u00a0relatively\u00a0higher\u00a0 intensity\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0peak\u00a0located\u00a0at\u00a0585.5\u00a0cm\u22121,\u00a0which\u00a0 revealed\u00a0that\u00a0ZnO-X\u00a0has\u00a0more\u00a0defects\u00a0than\u00a0ZW.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a06.\u00a0Raman\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0(a)\u00a0ZW,\u00a0(b)\u00a0ZnO-X\u00a0and\u00a0(c)\u00a0MW.\u00a0Inset\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0enlarged\u00a0Raman\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0\nZW\u00a0and\u00a0ZnO-X.\u00a0\n2.3.\u00a0Diffuse\u00a0Reflectance\u00a0Spectroscopy\u00a0Results:\u00a0Band\u00a0Position\u00a0and\u00a0Optical\u00a0Property\u00a0\nFigure\u00a07a\u00a0shows\u00a0the\u00a0room-temperature\u00a0UV-Vis\u00a0diffuse\u00a0reflectance\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0ZW\u00a0and\u00a0\nZnO-X.\u00a0The\u00a0increasing\u00a0adsorption\u00a0for\u00a0ZnO-X\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0region\u00a0between\u00a0450\u2013600\u00a0nm\u00a0shows\u00a0\nthe\u00a0enhanced\u00a0adsorption\u00a0properties\u00a0of\u00a0ZnO-X\u00a0 (as\u00a0 indicated\u00a0by\u00a0a\u00a0 square\u00a0 in\u00a0Figure\u00a07a),\u00a0\nFigure 6.

All ZnO-X samples obtained by annealing ZnO-H with melamine exhibited a slight red shift to a longer wavelength compared to ZW.\nMolecules\u00a02023,\u00a028,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 7\u00a0 of\u00a0 16\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nthe\u00a0band\u00a0gap\u00a0 (Eg)\u00a0was\u00a0estimated\u00a0by\u00a0extrapolating\u00a0 the\u00a0 tangent\u00a0 line\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0plot\u00a0of\u00a0 (\u03b1h\u03bd)2\u00a0 versus\u00a0h\u03bd\u00a0(Inset\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a07a).\u00a0 (\u03b1h\u03bd)2\u00a0=\u00a0A(h\u03bd\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Eg)\u00a0 (7)\nwhere\u00a0\u03b1,\u00a0h\u03bd,\u00a0A\u00a0and\u00a0Eg\u00a0are\u00a0absorption\u00a0coefficient,\u00a0photon\u00a0energy,\u00a0the\u00a0characteristic\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0 material\u00a0and\u00a0band\u00a0gap,\u00a0respectively.\u00a0The\u00a0band\u00a0gap\u00a0of\u00a0ZnO-X\u00a0was\u00a0less\u00a0than\u00a0ZW\u00a0(Table\u00a02).\u00a0 All\u00a0ZnO-X\u00a0samples\u00a0obtained\u00a0by\u00a0annealing\u00a0ZnO-H\u00a0with\u00a0melamine\u00a0exhibited\u00a0a\u00a0slight\u00a0red\u00a0 shift\u00a0to\u00a0a\u00a0longer\u00a0wavelength\u00a0compared\u00a0to\u00a0ZW.\u00a0 To\u00a0further\u00a0investigate\u00a0the\u00a0band\u00a0structure\u00a0of\u00a0ZnO-X\u00a0and\u00a0ZW,\u00a0the\u00a0Urbach\u00a0energy\u00a0(Eu)\u00a0 was\u00a0calculated\u00a0according\u00a0to\u00a0Equation\u00a0(8)\u00a0[15].\u00a0\nln(\u03b1)\u00a0=\u00a0\u03b10\u00a0+\u00a0h\u03bd/Eu\u00a0 \u00a0 (8)\nwhere\u00a0\u03b1,\u00a0h\u03bd,\u00a0\u03b10\u00a0and\u00a0Eu\u00a0are\u00a0absorption\u00a0coefficient,\u00a0photon\u00a0energy,\u00a0a\u00a0constant\u00a0and\u00a0Urbach\u00a0 energy,\u00a0respectively.\u00a0The\u00a0Eu\u00a0values\u00a0of\u00a0samples\u00a0were\u00a0determined\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0slope\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0linear\u00a0 portion\u00a0of\u00a0ln(\u03b1)~h\u03bd\u00a0curves\u00a0(Figure\u00a0S2\u00a0and\u00a0Table\u00a02).\u00a0Compared\u00a0to\u00a0ZW,\u00a0the\u00a0higher\u00a0Eu\u00a0values\u00a0 for\u00a0ZnO-X\u00a0indic t d\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0m lamine-assisted\u00a0thermal\u00a0activation\u00a0method\u00a0favors\u00a0the\u00a0formation\u00a0of\u00a0defects\u00a0in\u00a0ZnO,\u00a0which\u00a0is\u00a0expected\u00a0to\u00a0improve\u00a0the\u00a0photocatalytic\u00a0activity.\u00a0 According\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0XPS\u00a0valence\u00a0band\u00a0(VB)\u00a0spectra\u00a0(Figure\u00a07b),\u00a0the\u00a0VB\u00a0positions\u00a0of\u00a0ZW\u00a0 and\u00a0ZnO-1.2\u00a0were\u00a02.61\u00a0eV\u00a0and\u00a02.54\u00a0eV.\u00a0The\u00a0band\u00a0gaps\u00a0of\u00a0ZW\u00a0and\u00a0ZnO-1.2\u00a0were\u00a03.10\u00a0eV\u00a0 and\u00a03.05\u00a0eV.\u00a0Thus,\u00a0the\u00a0conduction\u00a0band\u00a0(CB)\u00a0position\u00a0of\u00a0ZW\u00a0and\u00a0ZnO-1.2\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0calculated\u00a0 by\u00a0Evb\u00a0=\u00a0Ecb\u00a0+\u00a0Eg,\u00a0where\u00a0Evb,\u00a0Ecb\u00a0and\u00a0Eg\u00a0are\u00a0VB\u00a0energy,\u00a0CB\u00a0energy\u00a0and\u00a0band\u00a0gap,\u00a0respectively.\u00a0 The\u00a0values\u00a0of\u00a0Ecb\u00a0were\u00a0\u22120.49\u00a0eV\u00a0and\u00a0\u22120.51\u00a0eV\u00a0for\u00a0ZW\u00a0and\u00a0ZnO-1.2.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a07.\u00a0(a)\u00a0UV-Vis\u00a0diffuse\u00a0reflectance\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0ZW\u00a0and\u00a0ZnO-X;\u00a0inset\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0corresponding\u00a0(\u03b1h\u03bd)2h\u03bd\u00a0curves,\u00a0(b)\u00a0XPS\u00a0valence\u00a0band\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0ZW\u00a0and\u00a0ZnO-1.2.\u00a0\nTable\u00a02.\u00a0Calculated\u00a0values\u00a0of\u00a0Eg\u00a0and\u00a0Eu\u00a0for\u00a0ZnO-X\u00a0and\u00a0ZW.\u00a0\nSample\u00a0 Eg\u00a0(eV)\u00a0 Eu\u00a0(eV)\u00a0 ZnO-0.6\u00a0 3.08\u00a0 0.236\u00a0 ZnO-0.8\u00a0 3.06\u00a0 0.249\u00a0 ZnO-1\u00a0 3.07\u00a0 0.223\u00a0 ZnO-1.2\u00a0 3.05\u00a0 0.262\u00a0 ZnO-1.4\u00a0 3.07\u00a0 0.167\u00a0 ZW\u00a0 3.10\u00a0 0.159\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\nigure 7.

The Eu values of samples were determined by the slope of the linear portion of ln(\u03b1)~h\u03bd curves (Figure S2 and Table 2). Compared to ZW, the higher Eu values for ZnO-X indicated that the melamine-assisted thermal activation method favors the formation of defects in ZnO, which is expected to improve the photocatalytic activity. According to the XPS valence band (VB) spectra (Figure 7b), the VB positions of ZW and ZnO-1.2 were 2.61 eV and 2.54 eV. The band gaps of ZW and ZnO-1.2 were 3.10 eV and 3.05 eV. Thus, the conduction band (CB) position of ZW and ZnO-1.2 can be calculated by Evb = Ecb + Eg, where Evb, Ecb and Eg are VB energy, CB energy and band gap, respectively. The values of Ecb were \u22120.49 eV and \u22120.51 eV for ZW and ZnO-1.2.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5329 8 of 16"

            "text": "DTA/TG analysis was employed to investigate the thermal decomposition of ZnO with and without melamine (Figure 8). Compared to pure ZnO-H and melamine, the mixture of ZnO-H and melamine showed different thermal behavior. There were four endothermic peaks (130 \u25e6C, 176 \u25e6C, 365 \u25e6C and 523 \u25e6C) and an exothermic peak at 537 \u25e6C in DTA for melamine (Figure 8a). The weight decreased dramatically in the range between 300 \u25e6C and 550 \u25e6C (Figure 8b), which was ascribed to the oxidation and decomposition of melamine. Complete decomposition of melamine at 600 \u25e6C was observed. For ZnO, no distinct peak and weight loss were measured in DTA and TG curves. The DTA curve for the mixture of ZnO-H and melamine also showed four endothermic peaks (133 \u25e6C, 154 \u25e6C, 343 \u25e6C and 516 \u25e6C), which moved to a lower temperature compared to melamine. An exothermic peak at 487 \u25e6C in the DTA curve was observed. The corresponding weight loss was measured to be 41.8%. When the temperature reached 540 \u25e6C, the weight of the mixture remained unchanged, and no weight loss occurred beyond this temperature. According to the mass ratio of ZnO to melamine (1.2:1), the percentage of melamine in the mixture was 45.5%. Combined with the XPS analyses, the weight loss (41.8%) of melamine indicated that most of melamine in the presence of ZnO decomposed and only a few carbon residues were left.\nMolecules\u00a02023,\u00a028,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 8\u00a0 of\u00a0 16\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n2.4.\u00a0Mechanism\u00a0of\u00a0Oriented- ro t \u00a0 \u00a0

(a) DTA curves and (b) TG curves of ZnO-H, the mixture of ZnO-H and melamine (the mass ratio of ZnO to melamine was 1.2:1) and melamine.\nMelamine decomposed to form NH3 as the temperature increased. Under this environment, oxygen vacancies were easier to form in ZnO-X than in ZW under oxygen-rich conditions, which was consistent with the results from XPS and Raman analyses. The presence of melamine resulted in ZnO showing different thermal behavior and growing along a specific direction, thus enhancing the expression of (100) planes on ZnO rods, which was affected by the ratio of ZnO to melamine. Therefore, calcining ZnO with melamine provided favorable conditions for the growth of (100) planes and vacancy-induced defects. It is known that ZnO shows a strong face-dependent photocatalytic activity. Among these lattice planes, the (100) planes of ZnO showed the highest activity, while the (00-1) and (110) planes showed lower activity. According to XRD analyses, more (100) planes were obtained for ZnO-1.2, which also increased the photocatalytic activity [22]. A similar effect of melamine on the growth of \u03b1-Fe2O3 was also observed. After calcining FeO-H (\u03b1-Fe2O3 prepared by the hydrothermal method) with and without melamine (labeled as sample FeO-1.2 and sample FW, respectively), both samples showed the rhombohedral structure of \u03b1-Fe2O3 (JCPDS No. 33-0664) and no diffraction peaks for g-C3N4 were detected (Figure 9a).

The concentration of MO decreased with the extension of irra-\ndiation time. The photocatalytic activity of samples was evaluated (C0 and Ct are the equi-\nlibrium concentrations of MO before and after irradiation, respectively). ZnO-X showed\nan improved photocatalytic activity. When using ZnO-0.6, ZnO-1.0 or ZnO-1.4 as the pho-\ntocatalyst, the degradation rate was less than 60% (Figure 10a).

With the increase in catalyst dosage from 0.1 to 0.5 g/L, the degradation rate of MO increased from 89.1% to 95.8% (Figure 11a). It is known that, the more catalyst is added, more active sites are available for MO degradation, which can improve the photocatalytic activity. However, increasing the catalyst dosage further (0.7 g/L) caused a decrease in t e degradation rate of MO (92.9%). Excessive catalyst would catter the light that penetrates int the eacti n system, leading to a decrease in the photocatalytic activity. Thus, an optimum catalyst dosage for the degradation of MO was 0.5 g/L. Figure 11b shows that the degradation rate of MO gradually decreased from 97.8% to 92.0% as the initial concentration of MO increased from 10 mg/L to 25 mg/L. At lower concentrations, all MO in solution could interact with the active sites on the surface of catalyst, which led to an increase in the degradation rate compared with those at higher initial MO concentra ions. The influence of initial pH of the reaction solution on the d gradation of MO was investigated (Figure 11c). When the pH value increased from 5.5 to 6.9, the degradation rate of MO increased from 91% to 95.8% and then slightly decreased to 86.1% at pH 8.0. MO changes to a negatively charged azo structure when the pH value is greater than 4.5 [27]. In our experimental conditions, the pH values were between 5.5\u20138.0 and MO molecules were negatively charged. Photocatalytic activity is related to the formation of reactive species such as hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH), superoxide radical anion (\u2022O2\u2212) and holes during the photocatalytic process. In basic conditions, it is easy for photogenerated holes to react with OH\u2212 to form \u2022OH. However, in our experiments, \u2022OH was not the dominant active substance during the degradation process. Therefore, a basic condition has less effect on improving photocatalytic activity. With the increasing pH value, more OH\u2212 in the solution would increase the competition with negatively charged MO, which could hinder the contact of MO with the catalyst and reduce the photocatalytic activity. Herein, the degradation rate of MO decreased to 86.1% while pH value increased to 8.0.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5329 11 of 16\nMolecules\u00a02023,\u00a028,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 11\u00a0 of\u00a0 16\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nactive\u00a0substance\u00a0during\u00a0the\u00a0degradation\u00a0process.\u00a0Therefore,\u00a0a\u00a0basic\u00a0condition\u00a0has\u00a0less\u00a0effect\u00a0on\u00a0improving\u00a0photocatalytic\u00a0activity.\u00a0With\u00a0the\u00a0increasing\u00a0pH\u00a0value,\u00a0more\u00a0OH\u2212\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0 solution\u00a0would\u00a0increase\u00a0the\u00a0competition\u00a0with\u00a0negatively\u00a0charged\u00a0MO,\u00a0which\u00a0could\u00a0hinder\u00a0 the\u00a0contact\u00a0of\u00a0MO\u00a0with\u00a0 the\u00a0catalyst\u00a0and\u00a0reduce\u00a0 the\u00a0photocatalytic\u00a0activity.\u00a0Herein,\u00a0 the\u00a0 degradation\u00a0rate\u00a0of\u00a0MO\u00a0decreased\u00a0to\u00a086.1%\u00a0while\u00a0pH\u00a0value\u00a0increased\u00a0to\u00a08.0.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a011.\u00a0The\u00a0effect\u00a0of\u00a0(a)\u00a0catalyst\u00a0dosage,\u00a0(b)\u00a0initial\u00a0concentration\u00a0of\u00a0MO\u00a0and\u00a0(c)\u00a0pH\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0photo-\ncatalytic\u00a0degradation\u00a0of\u00a0MO.\u00a0\nTo\u00a0investigate\u00a0the\u00a0stability\u00a0of\u00a0ZnO-1.2,\u00a0the\u00a0renewability\u00a0experiment\u00a0was\u00a0carried\u00a0out.\u00a0 After\u00a0four-cycle\u00a0experiments,\u00a0the\u00a0degradation\u00a0rate\u00a0of\u00a0ZnO-1.2\u00a0on\u00a0MO\u00a0was\u00a0maintained\u00a0at\u00a0 92%\u00a0after\u00a0120\u00a0min\u00a0of\u00a0irradiation\u00a0(Figure\u00a012).\u00a0The\u00a0reuse\u00a0examination\u00a0showed\u00a0that\u00a0ZnO-1.2\u00a0 could\u00a0be\u00a0recycled\u00a0four\u00a0times\u00a0without\u00a0loss\u00a0of\u00a0degradation\u00a0efficiency,\u00a0which\u00a0confirmed\u00a0that\u00a0 ZnO-1.2\u00a0has\u00a0good\u00a0stability\u00a0and\u00a0regeneration\u00a0capacity.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a012.\u00a0The\u00a0stability\u00a0of\u00a0ZnO-1.2\u00a0after\u00a04\u00a0cycles\u00a0of\u00a0photocatalytic\u00a0degradation\u00a0of\u00a0MO.\u00a0\nTo\u00a0investigate\u00a0the\u00a0photocatalytic\u00a0mechanism,\u00a0reactive-species-trapping\u00a0experiments\u00a0 were\u00a0performed\u00a0by\u00a0adding\u00a0IPA,\u00a0EDTA\u00a0and\u00a0AA\u00a0to\u00a0capture\u00a0the\u00a0active\u00a0substances\u00a0\u2022OH,\u00a0h+\u00a0 and\u00a0\u2022O2\u2212,\u00a0 respectively.\u00a0With\u00a0 the\u00a0addition\u00a0of\u00a0AA\u00a0and\u00a0EDTA,\u00a0 the\u00a0degradation\u00a0 rates\u00a0decreased\u00a0distinctly\u00a0(Figure\u00a013),\u00a0which\u00a0showed\u00a0that\u00a0\u2022O2\u2212\u00a0and\u00a0h+\u00a0were\u00a0the\u00a0dominant\u00a0active\u00a0 substances\u00a0during\u00a0the\u00a0degradation\u00a0process.\u00a0\nFigure 11.

Reactive-species-trapping experiments.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5329 12 of 16\nIt is known that photoinduced electrons and holes can migrate to the surface of ZnO to form superoxide and hydroxyl radicals with dissolved O2 and OH\u2212, respectively (Equations (9) and (10)) [28]. Since the bottom of the conduction band of ZnO is less than the standard redox potential of O2/\u2022O2\u2212 (\u22120.31 eV), photogenerated electrons can react with O2 to form \u2022O2\u2212 (Figure 14). However, the top of the valence band of ZnO is greater than that of OH\u2212/\u2022OH (2.74 eV), meaning photogenerated holes cannot react with OH\u2212 to form \u2022OH. Therefore, the degradation rate changed slightly with the addition of IPA (\u2022OH trapping agent). The addition of hole-trapping agent (EDTA) leading to a decrease in the degradation rates demonstrates that photogenerated holes could oxidize the pollutant. So, the reactive species during the photocatalytic process for both ZW and ZnO-1.2 are holes and \u2022O2\u2212.\nO2 + ZnO(e\u2212)\u2192 \u2022O2\u2212 (9) OH\u2212 + ZnO(h+)\u2192 \u2022OH (10) Molecules\u00a02023,\u00a028,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 13\u00a0 of\u00a0 16\u00a0\nFigure\u00a014.

The degradation mechanism of ZnO-X.\nHowever, in ur experiments, ZnO-X exhibited better photocatalytic properties in comparison with ZW. Based on the above XRD analyses, we found that calcining ZnO with melamine provided favorable conditions for the growth of non-polar (100) planes. It is known that oxygen vacancies formed mainly at the (100) surface of ZnO [29]. Combined with XPS, Raman and UV-Vis absorbance analyses, these results revealed that ZnO-X has more defects located at interfaces than ZW, which could provide more active sites for photocatalytic reaction and facilitate the transfer of photoinduced electron/hole pairs to the interface, leading to a higher photocatalytic activity of ZnO-X in comparison with ZW [29,30]. Therefore, with the enhanced adsorption properties of ZnO-X, the combination of oxygen vacancies with orientated growth led to the improvement of the photocatalytic property of ZnO-X."

            "text": "ZnO rods with oxygen vacancies and (100) planes were successfully synthesized by a melamine-assisted thermal activation method. Simply calcining ZnO with melamine introduced oxygen vacancies in ZnO and realized the orientation growth of ZnO rods. Raman and XPS spectra revealed the formation of oxygen vacancies in the ZnO. XRD analyses demonstrated that the higher ratio of ZnO to melamine led to greater amounts of (100) planes and oxygen vacancies in ZnO, and it reached the highest when the ratio was 1.2:1. Compared with ZnO-H and ZW, ZnO-X showed improved photocatalytic activity and ZnO-1.2 exhibited the highest photocatalytic degradation rate of MO (95.8%). After four cycles of photocatalytic degradation of MO, the degradation rate was still at 92%, which confirmed that ZnO-1.2 has good stability and regeneration capacity. The reactive species during the photocatalysis reaction were holes and \u2022O2\u2212 for both ZW and ZnO-X. The enhancement in photocatalytic activity could be attributed to the presence of oxygen vacancies and (100) planes, which favored photoinduced charges\u2019 separation and transfer. The more oxygen vacancies and (100) planes in the structure, the higher photocatalytic activity ZnO has. Vacancy-rich \u03b1-Fe2O3 was also prepared by this melamineassisted thermal activation method. Our study proved that the melamine-assisted thermal activation method can simplify the preparation process of materials with defects and improve photocatalytic properties, which provides a feasible route for the future design and synthesis of photocatalysts.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28145329/s1, Equation S1: Bragg equation.
