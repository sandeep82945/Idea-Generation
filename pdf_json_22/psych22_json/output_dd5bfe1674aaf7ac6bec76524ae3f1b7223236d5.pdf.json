Methods: Cross\u2010sectional design with 8th grade adolescents (n = 572, mean \u00b1 SD age 13.9 \u00b1 0.3 yrs). Outcome assessment was compulsive exercise (Compulsive Exercise Test, CET). Total CET score \u2265 15 was defined as clinical CET score. Further assessment included exercise motivation (Behavioural Regulation of Exercise Questionnaire\u20142), HRQoL (KIDSCREEN 27), accelerometer\u2010assessed physical activity and Andersen test for cardiorespiratory fitness. Exercise obsession was defined as clinical CET score and < 60 min/day with moderate\u2010to\u2010vigorous objectively assessed physi\u2010 cal activity. Results: Small sex differences were found for CET total score. Seven percent of the adolescents were classified with clinical CET score, and four percent with exercise obsession. Adolescents with clinical CET score had higher body mass index, more weight loss attempts, and lower physical fitness compared to adolescents with non\u2010clinical CET score. Being a boy, higher scores on introjected motivational regulation and HRQOL subscale parent relation and autonomy, use of exercise monitoring tool, and number of weight loss attempt the past 12 months explained 39% of the total CET score variance. Physical activity level did not predict compulsive exercise. Conclusions: Compulsive exercise in early adolescents was predicted by exercise motivation, exercise habit, and dieting, but not physical activity level. This implicates a distinction of obsessive cognitions about physical activity from performed physical activity in adolescents, and that such cognitions must be addressed in future initiatives that aim to improve adolescents\u2019 general physical activity level, health, and wellbeing. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03906851. Plain English summary: Although there is a huge concern about adolescents being insufficiently physically active, there are also adolescents who struggle with issues of compulsive exercise. The issues of compulsive exercise have been rarely studied in adolescents. We therefore aimed to describe compulsive exercise and factors that were associ\u2010 ated with and could explain presence of compulsive exercise. A total of 572 8th graders (age 13.9 \u00b1 0.3 yrs) responded to this study. We found that the score on compulsive exercise was higher in boys than in girls, and that adolescents \u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

Journal of Eating Disorders (2022) 10:156 Introduction Low levels of physical activity (PA) is a major public health concern, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to initiate a global action plan with the aim of reducing low levels of PA by 20% within 2030 [1]. Adolescence is the life phase with the steepest decline in PA levels, and this decline often continues into adulthood [2]. Despite this knowledge, adolescence as a life phase is understudied compared to other life phases [3]. Many strategies and initiatives have already been executed to promote more PA among adolescents with various level of success [4]. Unfortunately, in trying to move the young generation, the issue of PA and exercise becomes more complex as some adolescents develop an unhealthy, obsessive, and compulsive relationship to exercise [5, 6]. Compulsive exercise can be viewed in light of the DSM-5 criteria for obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder and is defined as exercise obsessions and compulsive actions driven by avoidance of the discomfort of exercise deprivation [7]. It is detected as the most common symptom of eating disorders in youth [8], viewed as a step towards use of other pathogenic weight-control methods [9], and acknowledged as a major burden for those affected [10]. The few studies examining compulsive exercise in the general adolescent population report inconsistency regarding prevalence differences between sexes [5, 11\u2013 13]. Compulsive exercise is predicted by dysfunctional emotion regulation [11]. Other identified predictors are socio-cultural risk factors such as feedback from family and peers about muscularity in boys and perceived thinness pressure from media in girls [5, 14, 15]. Plateau et al. [16] found higher levels of both compulsive exercise and disordered eating behaviour in adult users versus nonusers of exercise monitoring tools. Whether the use of such monitoring tools is linked to compulsive exercise among adolescents is unknown. Further, dimensions of compulsive exercise are associated with impaired quality of life in both clinical eating disorder and general populations [17]. Although the level of compulsive exercise is linked to athlete populations [18] and high PA levels [19, 20], a recent study showed that exercise obsessions without actual compulsive exercise behaviour is detected in 20% of hospitalized adult patients with longstanding eating disorders [19]. Poobalan et al. [21] found that intentions to exercise is not necessarily associated with actual exercise behaviour, this impacts our understanding of cognitions about exercise in the absence of actual performed PA and exercise. In general treatment of obsessive\u2013compulsive disorders, exposure and response prevention consists of exposing whatever elicits the anxiety or discomfort in different ways, and then learn how to resist any compulsion to stop the anxiety instead of employing obvious or subtle avoidance [22]. Given the complexity of compulsive exercise, the focus on one side is to stop the compulsion and the irresistibly internal urge to perform dysfunctional exercise behaviour. On the other side, it is important to encourage continuance with functional exercise behaviour. This complexity requires more understanding and knowledge. Motivation behind exercise has been described specifically as the key antecedents of compulsive exercise [23]. As motivation determines the initiation, maintenance, and completion of relevant behaviours, analysing adolescents\u2019 quality of motivation may be an important key to further understand compulsive exercise among this group. Using self-determination theory (SDT) [24] as a framework, we can examine the degree to which people engage in their actions with a complete feeling of choice. Moreover, SDT suggests that motivation toward any given behaviour can be either extrinsically, intrinsically or amotivated. These categorizations of motivation represent different degrees of internalization of external values and goals, and therefore differ in the degree to which they are self-determined or autonomous [24]. Amotivation refers to an absence of either extrinsic or intrinsic motivation, no perceived value of the activity, nor a belief that engaging in the activity will result in any personally meaningful outcomes. Extrinsic regulation is comprised of four different types of regulation: external regulation (i.e., perceived pressure to engage in the activity or to obtain some external incentive); introjected regulation (i.e., activity performed to avoid feelings of guilt, shame and anxiety); identified regulation (i.e., more selfdetermined type of motivation where the benefits and outcomes of the activity are valued as greater than the with high score on compulsive exercise had higher body mass index, more weight loss attempts, and lower physical fitness compared to adolescents with low score on compulsive exercise. Also, we found that exercise obsessions, i.e., thinking of exercise without actually exercising, was present in four percent of the respondents. Being a boy, attempt\u2010 ing weight loss, exercising to avoid shame/guilt, and exercising for the perceived value of exercise predicted compul\u2010 sive exercise. Awareness of the compulsive exercise and exercise obsessions is important in public health initiatives that aim to increase adolescents\u2019 physical activity level.",

Outcome assessment was compulsive exercise (Compulsive Exercise Test, CET). Total CET score \u2265 15 was defined as clinical CET score. Further assessment included exercise motivation (Behavioural Regulation of Exercise Questionnaire\u20142), HRQoL (KIDSCREEN 27), accelerometer\u2011assessed physical activity and Andersen test for cardiorespiratory fitness. Exercise obsession was defined as clinical CET score and < 60 min/day with moderate\u2011to\u2011vigorous objectively assessed physi\u2011 cal activity.\nResults: Small sex differences were found for CET total score. Seven percent of the adolescents were classified with clinical CET score, and four percent with exercise obsession. Adolescents with clinical CET score had higher body mass index, more weight loss attempts, and lower physical fitness compared to adolescents with non\u2011clinical CET score. Being a boy, higher scores on introjected motivational regulation and HRQOL subscale parent relation and autonomy, use of exercise monitoring tool, and number of weight loss attempt the past 12 months explained 39% of the total CET score variance. Physical activity level did not predict compulsive exercise.\nConclusions: Compulsive exercise in early adolescents was predicted by exercise motivation, exercise habit, and dieting, but not physical activity level. This implicates a distinction of obsessive cognitions about physical activity from performed physical activity in adolescents, and that such cognitions must be addressed in future initiatives that aim to improve adolescents\u2019 general physical activity level, health, and wellbeing.\nTrial registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03906851.\nPlain English summary: Although there is a huge concern about adolescents being insufficiently physically active, there are also adolescents who struggle with issues of compulsive exercise. The issues of compulsive exercise have been rarely studied in adolescents. We therefore aimed to describe compulsive exercise and factors that were associ\u2011 ated with and could explain presence of compulsive exercise. A total of 572 8th graders (age 13.9 \u00b1 0.3 yrs) responded to this study. We found that the score on compulsive exercise was higher in boys than in girls, and that adolescents\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

            "text": "Low levels of physical activity (PA) is a major public health concern, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to initiate a global action plan with the aim of reducing low levels of PA by 20% within 2030 [1]. Adolescence is the life phase with the steepest decline in PA levels, and this decline often continues into adulthood [2]. Despite this knowledge, adolescence as a life phase is understudied compared to other life phases [3]. Many strategies and initiatives have already been executed to promote more PA among adolescents with various level of success [4]. Unfortunately, in trying to move the young generation, the issue of PA and exercise becomes more complex as some adolescents develop an unhealthy, obsessive, and compulsive relationship to exercise [5, 6].\nCompulsive exercise can be viewed in light of the DSM-5 criteria for obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder and is defined as exercise obsessions and compulsive actions driven by avoidance of the discomfort of exercise deprivation [7]. It is detected as the most common symptom of eating disorders in youth [8], viewed as a step towards use of other pathogenic weight-control methods [9], and acknowledged as a major burden for those affected [10]. The few studies examining compulsive exercise in the general adolescent population report inconsistency regarding prevalence differences between sexes [5, 11\u2013 13]. Compulsive exercise is predicted by dysfunctional emotion regulation [11]. Other identified predictors are socio-cultural risk factors such as feedback from family and peers about muscularity in boys and perceived thinness pressure from media in girls [5, 14, 15]. Plateau et\u00a0al. [16] found higher levels of both compulsive exercise and disordered eating behaviour in adult users versus nonusers of exercise monitoring tools. Whether the use of such monitoring tools is linked to compulsive exercise among adolescents is unknown. Further, dimensions of compulsive exercise are associated with impaired quality of life in both clinical eating disorder and general populations [17].\nAlthough the level of compulsive exercise is linked to athlete populations [18] and high PA levels [19, 20], a recent study showed that exercise obsessions without actual compulsive exercise behaviour is detected in 20%\nof hospitalized adult patients with longstanding eating disorders [19]. Poobalan et\u00a0al. [21] found that intentions to exercise is not necessarily associated with actual exercise behaviour, this impacts our understanding of cognitions about exercise in the absence of actual performed PA and exercise. In general treatment of obsessive\u2013compulsive disorders, exposure and response prevention consists of exposing whatever elicits the anxiety or discomfort in different ways, and then learn how to resist any compulsion to stop the anxiety instead of employing obvious or subtle avoidance [22]. Given the complexity of compulsive exercise, the focus on one side is to stop the compulsion and the irresistibly internal urge to perform dysfunctional exercise behaviour. On the other side, it is important to encourage continuance with functional exercise behaviour. This complexity requires more understanding and knowledge.\nMotivation behind exercise has been described specifically as the key antecedents of compulsive exercise [23]. As motivation determines the initiation, maintenance, and completion of relevant behaviours, analysing adolescents\u2019 quality of motivation may be an important key to further understand compulsive exercise among this group. Using self-determination theory (SDT) [24] as a framework, we can examine the degree to which people engage in their actions with a complete feeling of choice. Moreover, SDT suggests that motivation toward any given behaviour can be either extrinsically, intrinsically or amotivated. These categorizations of motivation represent different degrees of internalization of external values and goals, and therefore differ in the degree to which they are self-determined or autonomous [24]. Amotivation refers to an absence of either extrinsic or intrinsic motivation, no perceived value of the activity, nor a belief that engaging in the activity will result in any personally meaningful outcomes. Extrinsic regulation is comprised of four different types of regulation: external regulation (i.e., perceived pressure to engage in the activity or to obtain some external incentive); introjected regulation (i.e., activity performed to avoid feelings of guilt, shame and anxiety); identified regulation (i.e., more selfdetermined type of motivation where the benefits and outcomes of the activity are valued as greater than the\nwith high score on compulsive exercise had higher body mass index, more weight loss attempts, and lower physical fitness compared to adolescents with low score on compulsive exercise. Also, we found that exercise obsessions, i.e., thinking of exercise without actually exercising, was present in four percent of the respondents. Being a boy, attempt\u2011 ing weight loss, exercising to avoid shame/guilt, and exercising for the perceived value of exercise predicted compul\u2011 sive exercise. Awareness of the compulsive exercise and exercise obsessions is important in public health initiatives that aim to increase adolescents\u2019 physical activity level.\nKeywords: Physical fitness, Mental health, Health promotion, Quality of life, Sports, Behavioral medicine\npotential unpleasantness); and integrated regulation (i.e., the behaviour connected to the activity is constructed in congruence with the other values and needs that make up one\u2019s personality) [24]. It is, according to SDT, only when individuals perform a behaviour because of the inherent fun and enjoyment in the activity, that the behaviour is fully intrinsically motivated. A comprehensive review by Standage and Ryan [25] showed that self-determined motivational regulations are related to more adaptive outcomes compared to controlling regulations and amotivation. To date, only a limited number of studies have examined the relationship between the motivational regulations established by SDT and forms of compulsive exercise [13, 26, 27]. Overall, most of these studies show that higher scores on introjected regulation, more specifically avoidance of shame and guilt, seems to be the strongest predictor of unhealthy forms of exercise (i.e., compulsive exercise and exercise dependence). However, they also show that more self-determined forms of motivation (e.g., integrated and identified regulations) are correlated with compulsive exercise, thus not fully confirming the predictions by SDT.\nThe overall aim of this study was to examine compulsive exercise in a Norwegian sample of early adolescents. We wanted to explore potential sex differences, differences in adolescents with and without clinical levels of compulsive exercise, and determine how PA level, exercise habits and motivation, dieting behaviour, and healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL) relate to compulsive exercise."

Accelerometers were initialized to start recording at 06:00 on the day after they were distributed. Epoch length was set to 10-s intervals. The criterion for a valid day was set as a wear time of 480\u00a0min/day between 06:00 and 24:00.

The items are divided into five subscales (avoidance and rule-driven behaviour, weight control exercise, mood improvement, lack of exercise enjoyment, and exercise rigidity). The CET total score is calculated by summing each mean subscale score. The Cronbach\u2019s alpha for CET total score in this sample was 0.88, with subscale alpha ranging from 0.67 to 0.90. A\nCET total score of 15 or higher has been identified as a clinical cut off [31], and this cut off score was used in this sample. To examine frequency of exercise obsessions, i.e., preoccupation with exercise without actually exercising as described in Bratland-Sanda et\u00a0 al. [32], all respondents with CET total score \u2265 15 and < 60\u00a0 min/day with moderate-to-vigorous PA were classified with exercise obsession.

Further, a higher total CET score in boys compared to girls, although the difference was small, was consistent with previous findings from French and US samples [12, 13]. The reason for this sex difference is believed to be related to a higher frequency of sport participation, weight lifting, and the use of exercise as a method to regulate weight and appearance among boys compared to girls [13]. However, our findings are somewhat contradictory to the latter hypothesis as we did not find any sex difference on the CET subscale weight control. In our study, seven percent of the sample was defined with clinical CET score. In clinical samples from females with eating disorders, the frequency of clinical CET score has been found to be 52\u201354% [19, 31]. To our knowledge, we are the first to identify the construct of exercise obsessions in an adolescent sample. Compared to the 20% defined with exercise obsessions in the adult clinical sample in Vrabel and Bratland-Sanda [19], we argue that the high percentage found in our general adolescent sample calls for greater attention to adolescents\u2019 thoughts and attitudes towards exercise in screening of adolescents\u2019 exercise behaviour in Norwegian as well as other Western societies.

The small to moderate differences in BMI, physical fitness, weight loss attempts, and use of exercise monitoring tools, and the moderate to large differences in external, introjected and identified regulation for exercise found among adolescents with clinical compared to nonclinical CET score, implies that high scores on compulsive exercise in general adolescent populations is linked to maladaptive thoughts about exercise, and dieting behaviour. The higher frequency of using fitness training centres as an exercise arena has also been linked to more external regulation and less self-determined exercise motivation compared to organized sports as an exercise arena for adolescents [41]. This is in accordance with previous findings of exercise addiction prevalence in fitness training centres attendees versus organized sport participants [42]. Compared to Goodwin et\u00a0al. [18] who found higher CET scores in sport versus non-sport participants, our findings might seem a bit surprising. Unfortunately, the study by Goodwin et\u00a0al. [18] did not examine other arenas for exercise participation than competitive sports, and thus potential associations between body dissatisfaction and compulsive exercise in other exercise arenas in that study have not been reported. Overall, in the current study, it seems that the adolescents with clinical CET scores are preoccupied with exercise, losing weight, and perceive high levels of both internal and external pressure to exercise. However, they seem to lack the actual adaptive and healthy exercise behaviour. Some studies have found that effortful inhibition of eating and appetitive behaviours (i.e., dieting) can have negative cognitive effects in the sense that it leads to more obsessive thoughts about food and eating in adults [43]. It may be that, for this group, preoccupation with exercise is characterized by a driven urge to exercise, without the perceived inability to actually stop exercising. In our opinion, this calls for attention to exercise obsessions without compulsive exercise actions as an important part of the compulsive exercise construct. For exercise obsessions in adolescents, we applied the WHO recommendations of 60-min with daily moderate-to-vigorous PA [33] as a cut off for low levels of PA. This includes all forms of PA, i.e., school-based PA, active transportation, leisuretime PA, and structured exercise and sport participation. This can be viewed as a strict cut off which might be insufficiently specific and thus include \u201cfalse positive\u201d. However, it must be emphasized that different criteria can be considered for screening of the general population versus categorization of exercise obsession in e.g., clinical samples from various populations with eating disorders. It is also in our opinion important to acknowledge the vast amount of research and evidence-base behind the recommendations of a minimum of one-hour daily\nPA for health in this age group, and thus we argue that it is important not to pathologize PA amounts below this recommendation in the general population.\nThe highly significant predictors for compulsive exercise determined by the regression analysis, i.e., sex, use of exercise monitoring tools, introjected regulation, and weight loss attempts, are in accordance with findings from Ganson et\u00a0 al. [44], Plateau et\u00a0 al. [16] and Symons Downs et\u00a0 al. [13]. These findings are not surprising as compulsive exercise is a well-known approach to regulation of body weight and appearance in both clinical and non-clinical populations [20, 44, 45]. The adolescents\u2019 use of monitoring tools for exercise can be viewed as one of several warning signs for compulsive exercise, and is therefore something parents, teachers and sport coaches must be aware of.\nInterestingly, the adolescents\u2019 level of objectively assessed physical activity was neither associated with nor did it predict the CET score. Based on previous findings in clinical populations, the construct of exercise as an\neating disorder symptom is more linked to compulsivity than an excessive amount [46]. Although Symons Downs et\u00a0al. [13] found more time reported spent in leisure-time exercise as predictor of compulsive exercise, this result was based on self-reported PA and exercise which has been found less valid compared to objective assessment of PA and exercise [47]. Our finding therefore adds to this knowledge in a general adolescent population.\nAll but one blocks used in the hierarchical multiple linear regression model provided significant changes to the model, with the greatest improvement in adjusted R2 from 6% (Model 3) to 28% (Model 4). Only the adding of BMI (Model 3) was not significant. The improvement of the model when adding the motivational regulation of exercise (Model 4) is in accordance with previous studies on the importance of these variables [13, 48]. One form of extrinsic motivation, i.e., controlled (introjected) motivational regulation of exercise, stood out as a core predictor for compulsive exercise. This is in accordance with findings from Symons Downs et\u00a0al. [13], who found\nTable 4 Predictors of compulsive exercise in adolescents\nUse of standardized regression coefficients (\u03b2\u2011value) from hierarchical linear regression analysis\nDependent variable: Total Compulsive Exercise Test score.

Further, Th\u00f8gersen-Ntoumani and Ntoumanis [48] found introjected regulation of exercise more closely linked to both adaptive and maladaptive behaviour in adult exercisers. Introjected regulation of exercise motivation refers to behaviour performed to avoid feelings of guilt, shame, and anxiety, and hence covers the core of the compulsive exercise construct. Thus, it is not surprising that introjected regulation showed a moderate, positive correlation with CET avoidance and ruledriven behaviour. According to SDT, intrinsic motivation is all about the enjoyment of the behaviour, and the negative, strong correlation between intrinsic motivation for exercise and the CET subscale \u201clack of enjoyment\u201d was expected. The strong, positive correlation of identified regulation with the CET subscale \u201crigidity\u201d was also expected as the identified regulation refers to behaviour performed as a sense of obligation. Thus, perceived benefits outweigh the perceived disadvantages, regardless of perceived enjoyment of the activity.\nStrengths of this study include a large sample of adolescents, high response rate, use of standardized and validated instruments, and the use of objective assessment of PA and physical fitness. Further, we believe it is a strength that we have a broad approach to exercise behaviour and thus can capture the complexity to a greater extent than previous studies. The cross-sectional design is a weakness together with the limited data on dieting behaviour. The study is also limited by the lack of data on disordered eating and eating disorders as this is important information when interpreting findings on dieting and compulsive exercise, and the huge difference in sample size between the groups with clinical and non-clinical CET score warrants caution when interpreting the results. Further, the lack of data on the adolescents that were absent from the school on the day of data collection limited our possibilities to examine potential response bias in the sample. As this study was conducted in Norway and similar studies with similar findings are from Western countries, this current study might therefore be most relevant for addressing compulsive exercise in Western cultures.\nThere is a need for longitudinal studies on how compulsive exercise evolves during childhood and adolescence, and whether it is linked to other mental health issues than eating disorders. Also, there is a need for separation of obsessive cognitions about exercise from actual performed exercise in adolescents, and knowledge about how such cognitions might serve as a great barrier towards healthy and joyful exercise participation. This warrants greater awareness about compulsive exercise in future initiatives and policy making aimed at increasing the general PA level in adolescents. There is a need\nalso for studies with larger and more equal-sized samples that have adequate power to analyse potential differences in PA, physical fitness, dieting, disordered eating, eating disorders, and motivational regulation of exercise among adolescents classified with exercise obsession, compared to the adolescents with and without compulsive exercise. Further, we argue that compulsive exercise is a better marker than performed exercise in screening of unhealthy and maladaptive behaviour related to dieting and exercise. Practitioners such as physical education teachers, sport coaches, and clinical exercise physiologists can use the knowledge derived from our study, together with previous knowledge about the importance of creating autonomy- and need-supporting environment to improve intrinsic motivation and thus healthy adherence to exercise [49]."

Compulsive exercise in adolescents was predicted by sex, use of exercise monitoring tools, exercise motivational regulations, and weight loss attempts, but not PA level. The findings implicate separation of obsessive cognitions about PA from actual PA level in adolescents, and that such cognitions must be addressed in future PA promoting initiatives.\nAbbreviations BMI: Body mass index; CET: Compulsive Exercise Test; DSM\u20115: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, 5th edition; HRQoL: Health\u2011related quality of life; PA: Physical activity; SDT: Self\u2011determination theory.\nAcknowledgements The authors want to thank all the adolescents who participated in the study.\nAuthor contributions SBS had the idea to the project, planned, participated in data collection, analy\u2011 sis, and led the writing and revising of the manuscript.
