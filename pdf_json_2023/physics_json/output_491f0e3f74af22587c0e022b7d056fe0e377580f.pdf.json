In fact, several studies have shown that pheomelanin can provide better ionizing radiation protection than eumelanin.22,23 Additionally, pheomelanogenesis was suggested to be related to Parkinson's disease (PD), as red hair color is associated with a signicantly higher risk for PD.24 However, other studies showed that loss of neuromelanin (a mixture of pheomelanin and eumelanin) and subsequent depigmentation of the substantia nigra is a hallmark feature of PD.25,26 Undermining our complete understanding of the material is that structural and functional studies of pheomelanin have long conicted with one another.23,27,28 Therefore, to better understand the functions of pheomelanin, detailed structural characterization is essential.\nNatural pheomelanin is likely synthesized from L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and cysteine.14,25 This biosynthesis is described by the Raper\u2013Mason pathway (RMP), in which the nucleophilic addition of cysteine to enzymatically generated DOPA quinone forms 5-cysteinyl-DOPA (5-CD), 2-cysteinylDOPA (2-CD), 2,5-dicysteinyl-DOPA and trace amounts of 6- cysteinyl-DOPA (6-CD) as the subunits of pheomelanin. Further oxidation leads to more hierarchical pheomelanin pigments. As with eumelanin, pheomelanin presents a signicant challenge\nChem. Sci., 2023, 14, 4183\u20134192 | 4183"

One of the reasons is the inherent difficulty in isolating pure pheomelanin.14 This is not only because of the lipids and proteins found together with the pigment even aer extensive attempts at purication, but also because pheomelanin covalently conjugates to and physically traps other biomolecules.30,31 Therefore, producing a high-delity chemical analogue of pheomelanin can play an important role in understanding the biomaterial.12 Previously, pheomelanin syntheses have been performed using a combination of L-DOPA and cysteine as comonomers, or using the 5-CD heterodimer.19,22,27,28,32\u201334 However, pheomelanin materials synthesized using these two main routes have not been thoroughly characterized and compared against each other. Presumably, this lack of investigation stems from the aforementioned challenges.\nFurthermore, although the primary structure is caused by covalent bond forming reactions, supramolecular interactions are important for the formation of melanin pigments because aggregation of the chromophores accounts for perturbations of the p-electron systems, thereby affecting color development.29,35 The covalent pathway for pheomelanin is elucidated by the RMP,14,16 but the non-covalent pathway has been relatively underappreciated, likely due to a lack of well-established model systems. The readily-accepted interactions in pheomelanin are hydrogen bonding and p\u2013p stacking, as demonstrated by eumelanin-based research.36\u201338 Recently, cation-p interactions have been shown to play a key role in the progressive assembly of polydopamine (PDA) type eumelanin.39 Since nature has utilized cation-p interactions for various important biomacromolecules,40 it is desirable to determine whether this important supramolecular interaction also exists in pheomelanin.\nHere, we show the synthesis of articial pheomelanin and directly compare it with multiple natural samples for\n4184 | Chem.

Through comprehensive characterization, properties such as color and spectral signatures via ssNMR and EPR were identied and assigned to natural pheomelanin.

(Method 1) KMnO4 was used to oxidize a solution phase mixture of cysteine and L-DOPA in water at pH 7.32 (Method 2) Oxygen was used to oxidize cysteine and L-DOPA in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) in the presence of tyrosinase.33 However, as shown in Fig. 1B, the aromatic region (\u223c100\u2013160 ppm) of sample from methods 1 and 2 are very weak, especially compared to the aliphatic peak (55, 30 ppm) and carbonyl peak (175 ppm), while pheomelanin made of benzothiazine subunits14,25 is expected to show strong aromatic peaks, aliphatic peaks, and carboxylic acid peaks (Fig. S1\u2020). This spectral disparity suggests strongly that the two synthetic methods do not provide mimetics for natural pheomelanin. We use ssNMR as the main characterization method because it can minimize disruptive sample preparation compared to other typical methods like chemical degradation and highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation.41,42 To verify if the possible disulde species hinder the pheomelanin formation, KMnO4 was used to oxidize a solution phase mixture of cysteine and L-DOPA in water at pH 7, following the in situ reduction of cystine (Fig. S1\u2020), yet this attempt resulted in a similar ssNMR spectra as method 1 and 2. The structural discrepancy of the well-established methods encouraged us to try a third method (Method 3), in which we employed 5- cysteinyl-DOPA (5-CD) as the starting monomeric material (Fig. 1A3, and see S2 and S3\u2020 for the synthesis and\n) (Method 1) KMnO4 was used to oxidize a solution phase mixture of xidize cysteine and L-DOPA in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in the as the starting material under chemoenzymatic oxidation with horsespinning (CP-MAS) 13C ssNMR spectra of the pheomelanin samples roduced from our previous work.23\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Zinc sulphate was added to the reaction to aid in retaining carboxylic acid groups in the benzothiazine intermediates.28,31 As shown in Fig. 1B, only Method 3 yields a pheomelanin structure with reasonable ssNMR features. Previously, pheomelanin materials synthesized using these three methods have not been thoroughly compared. Our ssNMR data show that only the 5-CD method gives a close pheomelanin mimic, while using L-DOPA and cysteine does not.\n5-CD polymerization reaction proceeds from an initially clear, light-yellow solution becoming bright yellow upon mixing the H2O2 and HRP with 5-CD (Fig. 2A). The solution changed from yellow to orange, to red, and eventually to a dark reddish brown over 24 h. The color change is distinct from the conventional PDA or poly(L-DOPA)-based eumelanin synthesis which quickly results in a yellow, to dark brown and nally to a black solution.43 As monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. S4\u2020), a peak around 390 nm developed during the rst 5 min to 1 h period. This is followed by a more broadband absorption appearing aer 2 h corresponding to an extension of the conjugated structure and more hierarchical polymers. This absorption spectroscopy change is consistent with previous observations by Napolitano.28 Absorbance at 500 nm, which can be used to quantify the total amount of melanin,18 increased over the time course of the polymerization reaction (Fig. 2B). HPLC and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) data obtained periodically from aliquots of the reaction, revealed an expected 5-CD depletion (tR = 9.3 min, [M + H]\n+ m/z = 316.96) and its conversion to the intermediate 3-oxo-3,4dihydrobenzothiazine (tR = 12.5 min, [M + H]\n+ m/z= 268.88) (Fig. S4\u2020).\nThe reaction yielded irregular colloidal aggregates as characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 2C) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) (Fig. S5\u2020).\nFig. 2 Chemical synthesis of pheomelanin using 5-cysteinyl-DOPA (5-C reaction.

The peaks at 172.7 ppm and 165.7 ppm were ascribed to the \u2013COOH groups from 5-CD moiety (13C ssNMR of 5-CD monomer is displayed for comparison), while the decrease in the peak at 150.3 ppm corresponds to a change from the catechol structure of the monomer to the o-aminophenol structure of the benzothiazine subunit. The peak at 137.7 ppm was assigned to aromatic signals belonging to benzothiazine units as reported of polycysteinyldopamine by Ambrico.44 We note here that the spectral features in the carbonyl and aromatic regions are highly similar to that of a previously described selenomelanin, a benzoselenazine-based analogue.23 In addition, the aliphatic moieties (20\u201360 ppm) in the 5-CD pheomelanin spectrum have a smaller integration area relative to that of\nD) as the starting material.

Taken together, our results support the idea that the 5- CD polymerization proceeds according to the RMP and forms benzothiazine-based pheomelanin. Therefore, method 3 should be used for future studies regarding pheomelanin function and applications.\nComparison of synthetic pheomelanin with natural pheomelanin from different sources\nTo perform a direct comparison of synthetic pheomelanin prepared from 5-CD with natural samples, pheomelanins were extracted from Rhode Island red rooster feathers, and human red hair from two separate individuals (Fig. 3). Enzymatic extraction was chosen over chemical extraction because the mild conditions are expected to preserve the melanin in its natural form far better than harsher conditions.45 Aer a series of enzymatic treatment cycles and washing steps, the sample was characterized via various techniques including SEM, DLS, and ssNMR to provide information regarding the natural chemical structure. Particles from the natural pheomelanin samples exhibit a more irregular shape than extracted eumelanin nanomaterials, as previously reported.1,21,46 The size of the resulting particles varies with rooster feathers about 330 nm in diameter by SEM microscopy (Fig. 3A) and particles from human hair measuring in the micrometer length scale (Fig. 3C), which also agree with the DLS results (Fig. 3D\u2013F). Interestingly, we observed a size variation of the pheomelanin from two human donors likely due to the donor difference. z-Potential of the natural pheomelanin samples ranges from \u221234 mV to \u221244 mV (Fig. S7A\u2020), similar to that of the synthetic sample.\nFig. 3 Natural pheomelanins extracted from bird feathers and human re natural pheomelanin samples extracted from rooster feathers, human r corresponding natural pheomelanins. Inset are the optical images of the\n4186 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 4183\u20134192\n13C ssNMR of pheomelanin extracted from bird feathers showed a rough similarity in the aromatic region to that of the synthetic pheomelanin (Fig. 4A). ssNMR of hair pheomelanins is similar to that seen in previous literature examples (Fig. S7B and C\u2020).30 There are some signals ascribed to proteinaceous components (172 ppm and the region 50\u201310 ppm). However, extra proteinase-K treatment does not signicantly decrease the lipid signal intensities (Fig. S7D\u2020), which indicates that peptides/proteins may be physically trapped within the pheomelanin, rendering them less accessible to enzyme extraction.47 In turn, three higher intensity peaks in the feather sample at \u223c172 ppm, 72 ppm and 33 ppm were assigned to lipids. Similar assignments to lipids were reported by Stark in a fungal melanin sample.47 Lipid peaks were also observed in the human hair samples, which is further supported by FTIR peaks at \u223c2955 cm\u22121 (aliphatic C\u2013H stretch vibration, Fig. 4B). UV-vis spectra each showed broadband absorption (Fig. 4C), which is typical for melanin and melanin-like materials.29 The absorption spectra from 250 nm to 800 nm of 5-CD pheomelanin and pheomelanins from red hair showed similar features to the previous observation by Napolitano.28\nThese studies conrm the morphology and the chemical form by comparison of 5-CD based synthetic and natural pheomelanins. However, there are limitations to this approach, as we could not distinguish benzothiazine and benzothiazole based on the 13C ssNMR. It is known that UVA irradiation could convert benzothiazine moieties to benzothiazole units in natural pheomelanin based on HPLC analysis.31,48 We performed UV (365 nm, 7.0 mW cm\u22122) irradiation of our 5-CD pheomelanin for 30 h and characterized them by CP-MAS ssNMR (Fig. S7E\u2020).

Here we choose PDA as a synthetic eumelanin mimic because PDA is the most commonly-used and well-studied standard for eumelanin in literature.12,49 In contrast to PDA-based lm studies, pheomelanin lms from close mimics of natural pheomelanin have not been studied.44,50 Pheomelanin lms were prepared by submerging a glass slide in the polymerization reaction solution (Fig. 5). PDA lms were prepared similarly via the oxidative polymerization of dopamine under alkaline conditions in the presence of a glass slide.51 The water contact angle of pheomelanin was 20.7\u00b0 (Fig. 5A), smaller than that of PDA (34.8\u00b0, Fig. 5B) and blank glass (25.5\u00b0, Fig. 5C), indicative of a higher hydrophilicity. Our data showed that a continuous pheomelanin lm can also be prepared (Fig. 5D, see PDA control 5E and blank glass 5F). The synthetic lm showed the typical broadband absorption seen in aqueous\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\ndispersion (Fig. S8\u2020). Other substrates like polystyrene and gold substrates could also be coated (Fig. 5G). Additionally, the pheomelanin could also be deposited onto a 3D-printed polymethacrylate object (Fig. 5H), showing the versatility of surface modication with these materials. Furthermore, synthetic pheomelanin appears reddish brown in color compared with the darker, black PDA at identical particle concentration bymass (1mgmL\u22121) (Fig. 5I). Reectance spectra of the lmsmade of synthetic and natural pheomelanin showed a peak around 670 nm, corresponding to the visual red color of pheomelanin (Fig. S8\u2020). Considering the long-lasting enthusiasm of polydopamine chemistry on surfaces for numerous applications,37,49,52 these pheomelanin lms should be of signicant interest as a surface modication and photochemical responsive material.44"

In addition, quantitative EPR in dispersion elucidated that the spin concentration of the pheomelanin is \u223c1.7 times higher than that of PDA-type eumelanin (Fig. S9\u2020), consistent with previous studies.22\nTo further study the difference between pheomelanin and eumelanin, a continuous-wave EPR power saturation curve was measured (Fig. 6B). In these plots, the signal amplitude of an EPR spectrum was plotted against the square root of the incident microwave power P. The signal amplitude increased linearly with the square root of P until it began to saturate, and then decreased in intensity. The 5-CD pheomelanin (Fig. 6B) behaved similarly to the pheomelanin from rooster feathers, whereas the slower saturation of PDA melanin (Fig. 6B) with increasing power compared with pheomelanin suggests a longer spinlattice relaxation time caused by the different chemical structures.

To further quantify the spinlattice relaxation time T1, pulse EPR measurements were utilized. Pulse experiments can measure relaxation time more directly than the continuous-wave saturation experiment. The T1 is 18.8 ms for synthetic pheomelanin (Fig. 6C), which agrees reasonably well with the feather pheomelanin (15.4 ms) and is much shorter than PDA eumelanin (55.5 ms, Fig. 6D).\nCation-p interactions elucidated by controlled disassembly\nAlthough the RMP provides a molecular pathway for the synthesis of pheomelanin, the concomitant non-covalent pathway for pheomelanin remains elusive. Nature is known to use cation-p interactions to bind important small molecules, like acetylcholine.40,56 In biomacromolecules like proteins, cation-p interactions make signicant energetic contributions to protein stability.57 In the Protein Data Bank, 1 out of 77 amino acid residues has cation-p interactions.40 Melanin is a biomacromolecule that has conjugated p systems and cationic groups, making cation-p interactions readily accessible.

View Article Online\nmimics of eumelanin.39 Based on the chemical structure of pheomelanin, we hypothesize that cation-p interactions could exist in pheomelanin, along with the more commonly accepted hydrogen bonding and p\u2013p interactions. Compared with the well-studied PDA, the supramolecular interactions of the pheomelanin are more difficult to decipher due to the lack of a well-established model system. Here, we utilized our synthetic pheomelanin lms as a model system to study the supramolecular interactions in pheomelanin.\nWe speculated that deprotonation of the cationic ammonium might result in disassembly of the entire pheomelanin thin lm if cation-p bonding is the dominant driving force for pheomelanin supramolecular formation (Fig. 7). First, we found that KOH aqueous solution (pH 10) could quickly trigger the disassembly of the pheomelanin lm (Fig. 7A and B),58 whereas the lm is stable in deionized water, pH 7.4 buffer and 1% acetic acid solution (Fig. S8\u2020), suggesting the high stability at neutral or acidic environment. The pKa of phenol hydroxyl group in tyrosine is 10.10. The pKa of \u2013COOH is 1.91 and 2.18 for cystine and tyrosine. Therefore, the phenol remains protonated and \u2013COOH remains deprotonated at the experimental conditions: pH 7 and pH 10.0. The disassembly of pheomelanin triggered by pH change from 7 to 10.0 indicates that the deprotonation of ammonium is the dominant factor for this change. Secondly, the solution salinity strongly impacts the disassembly process under identical pH conditions. The addition of KCl (0.5 M) provides a strong cation-p interaction, and therefore can compensate for the deprotonation of cationic amine (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, lowering potassium concentrations leads to a smaller compensation effect (Fig. S10\u2020). The observed KCl salt compensation could be caused by salt bridge interactions or cation-p interactions. However, typical cation-p bonding between a cation and a hydrophobic aromatic group is known to be stronger than salt bridges between oppositely charged species in aqueous solution because of its low desolvation penalty.59 Therefore, we speculate that the loss of cation- p bonding is the main reason for pheomelanin lm disassembly. We note here that salt bridge interaction should also exist in the synthetic pheomelanin lm. To test this, another cation, Na+ was used, because Na+ has a lower binding affinity to the electron-rich p system than K+ based on previous experimental and simulation studies.60 In our experiment, NaCl (0.5 M) showed only a very small compensation effect for disassembly, suggesting that the cation- p interaction is the main driving force for the stabilization of pheomelanin disassembly. UV-vis spectra were recorded of the resulting lm (Fig. 7C), and the statistical test showed that 0.5 M KCl treated lm has the same absorbance at 400 nm with the pristine one (P = 0.41, Fig. 7D), whereas the 0.5 M NaCl and pH 10 solution led to much lower absorbance values (P = 0.0002, 0.0005 with reference to 0.5 M KCl treated lm). Aer the salt treatment, SEM micrographs (Fig. 7E) conrmed that the lm was mostly preserved in KCl solution, slightly preserved in NaCl solution, and only blank glass substrate could be observed under SEM aer treatment with a pH 10 KOH solution. Additionally, to decouple this cation compensation effect from the type of anion, we then screened different counterions including Br\u2212\n4190 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 4183\u20134192\nand SO4 2\u2212 (Fig. S10\u2020). Similarly colored lms were observed for alternated anions as compared to treatment with the KCl solution, and absorption mapping at 400 nm of the lm supported a similar trend (Fig. S10\u2020), indicating that the cationic species is the dominating factor in the pheomelanin disassembly process. The results collectively suggest the cation-p interaction contributes in a dominant fashion to the assembly of the synthetic pheomelanin pigment. Although we mainly highlight the intermolecular cation-p interaction, it is anticipated that intramolecular cation-p61,62 should also exist in pheomelanin biomacromolecule. Understanding the supramolecular pathway of pheomelaningenesis could lead to novel routes for manipulating articial pheomelanin synthetically. This high-delity pheomelanin model also could enable the elucidation of other enigmatic properties and biological functions of pheomelanin."

            "text": "Pheomelanin is an important part of the diverse melanin family. Producing a high-delity chemical analogue of pheomelanin can play an important role in understanding the biomaterial. Biosynthetic and synthetic attempts at pheomelanin have been investigated multiple times over several decades by different groups,19,27,28 with most efforts focused on reaction intermediate studies and degradation product identication.28,63 Yet thorough characterization of the resulting polymeric materials with reference to the natural product has been lacking. Here we reiterate the importance of parallel comparison and full characterization of different synthetic routes and natural products. This work identied the false methods and therefore, is an important guidance and benchmark for the future synthesis and utilization of pheomelanin biomaterials. We demonstrated that the chemoenzymatic oxidation of 5-CD could yield benzothiazine-based pheomelanin, but using cysteine and L-DOPA failed, possibly because of the slow redox step to give cysteinyldopaquinone.25 Although the 5-CD synthetic method is only one step further in the RMP, it altered the polymerization pathway signicantly,27 likely due to the suppression of the addition of cysteine to the quickly growing polymer chains.19 Moreover, these approaches could also help to elucidate the more enigmatic neuromelanin, which is believed to have structural features of both eumelanin and pheomelanin.\nIn nature, pheomelanin is found as a mixture of melanins according to the previously proposed \u201ccasing\u201d model (pheomelanin cores encased by eumelanin surfaces).14,26 This makes it a formidable challenge to study the properties of the pheomelanin polymer from natural sources. Synthetic methods, such as the use of 5-CD monomers, provide a route to circumvent the casing model since no eumelanin monomer is involved. As eumelanin typically has a well-dened shape, the absence of the casing eumelanin may account for the irregular morphology of 5-CD synthetic pheomelanin. To be clear, we note that despite structural similarity at the molecular level, morphologically the chemoenzymatic approach to synthetic pheomelanin yields irregular structures as opposed to the\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Presumably, this is because biological processes guide the in vivo pheomelanogenesis utilizing connement (liposomal, or casing induced) and genetically programmed progression of the melanosome. To truly mimic the shape and chemistry of the pheomelanosomes, synthetic templation or self-assembled nanoarchitecture approaches should be developed. Insight derived from our study highlighting the importance of cation-p interactions may give direction to such an approach.\nIn summary, 5-cysteinyl-DOPA oxidation under enzymatic conditions yields a close structural mimic to natural pheomelanin. Notably, synthetic pheomelanin was found to be more hydrophilic, exhibits a lower T1 relaxation time than polydopamine-type eumelanin and is a reddish-brown color at the same mass concentration. Alongside the extensive structural characterization of pheomelanin, with this synthetic tool in hand, we found that cation-p interactions exist in synthetic pheomelanin. This insight may provide a deeper understanding of the melanogenesis of one of the most important melanin subfamilies in nature. Further research will focus on controlling monomer composition, introducing other functionalities, and controlling nanoscale/microscale morphology. Moreover, the pursuit of better synthetic mimics for melanin classes, including for eumelanin, where it is known that PDA is a common but incomplete analogue, promises to shed much needed light on function and molecular structure of melanins more generally.12"
