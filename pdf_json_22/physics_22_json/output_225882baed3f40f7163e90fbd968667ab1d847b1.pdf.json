We use coherent WaveBurst (cWB) pipeline enhanced with a decision-tree classification algorithm for more efficient separation of GW signals from noise transients. The machine-learning (ML) algorithm is trained on a representative set of noise events and a set of simulated stochastic signals that are not correlated with any known signal model. This training procedure preserves the model-independent nature of the search. We demonstrate that the ML-enhanced cWB pipeline can detect GW signals at a larger distance than previous model-independent searches. The sensitivity improvements are achieved across the broad spectrum of simulated signals, with the goal of testing the robustness of this model-agnostic search. At a false-alarm rate of one event per century, the detectable signal amplitudes are reduced up to almost an order of magnitude, most notably for the single-cycle signal morphologies. This ML-enhanced pipeline also improves the detection efficiency of compact binary mergers in a wide range of masses, from stellar mass to intermediate-mass black holes, both with circular and elliptical orbits. After excluding previously detected compact binaries, no new gravitational-wave signals are observed for the two-fold Hanford-Livingston and the three-fold Hanford-Livingston-Virgo detector networks. With the improved sensitivity of the all-sky search, we obtain the most stringent constraints on the isotropic emission of gravitational-wave energy from short-duration burst sources.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe first detection of a gravitational wave (GW) signal, GW150914 [1], in 2015, during the earliest observing run of the Advanced LIGO detectors [2], opened a new observation window to study the Universe. In the following runs, the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo [3] detectors have recorded around a hundred GW signals [4\u20137]. All these detected GW sources are interpreted as compact binary coalescences (CBC), with the majority being binary black hole (BBH) mergers. However, gravitational waves from other, less understood GW sources, still remain elusive [8, 9].\nSeveral astrophysical sources are predicted to produce short bursts of GW radiation with a duration of up to a few seconds. They could be roughly divided into two\na E-mail: francesco.salemi@unitn.it\ncategories. The first category includes late inspiral and merger waves from CBCs comprised of black holes and/or neutron stars. Types of CBC signals include binary systems with circular orbits [10\u201314], eccentric orbits [15\u2013 21], head-on collisions [22, 23], extreme mass-ratio binaries [24], primordial black holes [25\u201328], and hyperbolic encounters [29\u201331]. Gravitational waves may also be generated in the post-merger phase of the binary neutron star systems [32, 33]. The second category includes all other anticipated burst progenitors, such as star explosions, neutron star glitches, or unknown sources. Prime examples of the star explosions are core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) [34\u201341], hypernovae [42], superluminous supernovae [43], supernovae type Ia [44], and pulsation pair-instability supernovae [45\u201347]. Also, gravitational waves may be produced during a black-hole formation from a collapsing star [48\u201350], quantum chromodynamics phase transition in a core-collapse supernova [51], or in a collapsar [52, 53]. The resulting gravitational waves from these source types are typically predicted to be ar X iv :2\n21 0.\n01 75\n4v 2\n[ gr\n-q c]\n1 1\nN ov\n2 02\n2\n2 stochastic. Neutron stars or pulsar glitches are expected to generate ringdown GW signals [54\u201357]. Other potential burst sources are the soft gamma repeaters [58] and cosmic strings (CSs) [59, 60].\nFor most of the GW sources mentioned above, the simulations of accurate and computationally efficient GW waveforms (templates) are not readily available, which limits the use of the matched filter methods. This is the reason why the burst algorithms [61\u201367], designed to detect a wide range of GW sources without templates, are actively used for GW searches in data collected by the LIGO[2], Virgo [3], KAGRA [68] and GEO600 [69] detectors.\nCoherent WaveBurst (cWB) [61] has been used to search for burst signals [70\u201376] and BBH signals [4, 5, 7, 77\u201381]. It has made a major contributions in the discovery of the first GW signal GW150914 [1, 82] and the first intermediate-mass black hole merger GW190521 [83, 84]. Also, cWB contributed to the Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogs (GWTCs) [4, 5, 7], to population studies of IMBH sources [85, 86], and the search for specific CBC properties, such as higher-order multipoles [87, 88].\nBy using a few assumptions about GW signals, cWB identifies the excess power triggers in the data from multiple detectors. A reduction of the false-alarm rate is accomplished with a post-production veto procedure making use of summary statistics calculated for each trigger. This paper presents a generic burst search using cWB enhanced with machine learning (ML) to improve the separation of GW signals from the noise transients. Similar to the standard veto procedure, supervised classification algorithms can achieve an efficient reduction of the cWB false-alarm rate. In [89] a neural network method analyzing the time-frequency patterns of reconstructed cWB triggers was suggested to improve the detection of BBH signals. In [90] a machine-learning method was used to improve the identification of CCSNe. In both cases, a strong model dependence was introduced at the cWB post-production stage, limiting the pipeline detection to a specific source used for the ML training. A more practical weakly-modeled classification based on the XGBoost decision trees was introduced in [91, 92] to enhance the cWB detection of the BBH signals. Unlike templatebased searches that find events based on a specific signal model, the XGBoost classification is designed to penalize events inconsistent with generic signal features. More recently, a different signal-noise classification based on the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) methodology was developed for generic burst searches with cWB [93]. In this approach, the GMM likelihood model is tuned on a separated subset of the simulated events used to benchmark the performances, sparsely sampling the ranges of burst frequency and duration. Instead, in this paper, we use the XGBoost decision-tree algorithm, which is trained on a representative set of noise events and a set of simulated signals with stochastic waveforms that are not correlated with any known signal model. The training set is densely covering the frequency band and the range of burst dura-\ntion selected for the analysis. We demonstrate the sensitivity improvement across a broad spectrum of simulated signals not used for the XGBoost training. With this more sensitive algorithm, we re-analyze the data from the third observing run (O3) of the LIGO and Virgo detectors, targeting bursts in the frequency band up to 1 kHz.\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section II describes the ML-enhanced cWB pipeline, the data analyzed, and simulated signals used for training the ML algorithm. Section III describes signal models used for testing the search sensitivity. Section IV provides results of the ML-enhanced cWB search compared with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) all-sky search for short duration bursts [8]."

            "text": "Coherent WaveBurst (cWB) is a burst search pipeline that can detect GW signals from astrophysical sources without templates [61\u201365]. The cWB algorithm identifies excess-power triggers in the time-frequency data obtained with the multi-resolution Wilson-DaubechiesMeyer (WDM) wavelet transform [94] of the strain data from multiple detectors. By using the constrained likelihood method [61], it reconstructs the source location in the sky and the signal waveform: incoming gravitational waves should produce coherent responses over the detector network, while in general, the noise events are not correlated. The rate of triggers produced by the pipeline is controlled by model-independent veto thresholds on the excess-power statistics and the coherent amplitude \u03b70 that characterizes the coherence of a cWB trigger across the detector network. The veto thresholds are set to be sufficiently low to avoid costly re-runs of the pipeline trigger production. Further reduction of the cWB falsealarm rate is achieved with a more stringent veto procedure by applying thresholds on the summary statistics calculated for each trigger, including the \u03b70, the crosscorrelation coefficient between the detectors, the reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio in each detector, the number of WDM resolutions used for the reconstruction and the waveform shape parameters (see Appendix Afor more details).\nAlthough this veto procedure generally works quite efficiently, designing vetoes in the multi-dimensional space of summary statistics is challenging and requires retuning the veto thresholds for each detector network configuration and observing run. In addition, due to distinctive noise sources, cWB triggers are typically split into different categories (so-called \"search bins\") and analyzed separately. To solve these issues, a boosted decision-tree algorithm, eXtreme-Gradient Boost (XGBoost) [95], was adopted and implemented within the\n3 cWB framework to automate the signal-noise classification of cWB triggers [91]. Two types of input data are used: signal events from simulations and noise events from background estimations. For each event, a selected subset of cWB summary statistics (see Appendix A for more details) is used by XGBoost as input features to train a signal-noise model. This ML method simplifies the analysis approach by jointly analyzing all candidate events within a single search bin. As described in Refs. [91, 92], the detection statistic for the ML-enhanced cWB algorithm is defined by:\n\u03b7r = \u03b70 \u00b7WXGB, (1)\nwhere \u03b70 is the cWB ranking statistic and WXGB is the XGBoost penalty factor ranging between 0 (noise) and 1 (signal).\nThis study extends the ML-enhanced cWBmethod [91, 92] to generic burst searches in the frequency band [16, 1024]Hz. In order to preserve the model-independent nature of cWB and be sensitive to generic GW signals, when training the XGBoost, we select as input features the summary statistics that do not depend on the waveform morphology (see Appendix A for details). Moreover, we do not train XGBoost on anticipated GW signals that follow specific astrophysical distributions. Instead, we use a stochastic set of band-limited White-Noise-Burst (WNB) signals: i.e., white noise contained within an ad-hoc timefrequency range. The WNB signals populate a wide range of randomly chosen signal durations and frequency bands. To that end, we use two sets of WNB for training: (a) WNBs uniformly distributed in central frequency in the range [24,996] Hz, bandwidth [10,300]Hz, and duration is logarithmically distributed between 0.1ms and 1ms; (b) WNBs logarithmically distributed in central frequency [24,450]Hz, bandwidth [10,250]Hz and duration [1,50]ms. The WNB signals are explicitly chosen to span a space of two parameters (Qa, Qp): Qa is an estimator of how much energy occurs outside the largest oscillation of the event\u2019s waveform and Qp is a parameter linked to the event number of cycles [91, 92]. Within this simplified 2- D parameters space, low-Q noise transients can be better identified by the ML classifier and, therefore, penalized. Furthermore, this approach efficiently removes one of the most challenging noise sources - blip glitches [8, 96]. The details of the changes introduced to the ML method for improving the sensitivity toward generic burst sources are described in Appendix A."

The two epochs have significantly different rates of short-duration glitches.\nIn this paper, we analyze HL and HLV detector networks. The HV and LV networks are omitted due to their lower sensitivities and shorter additional observing time with respect to the HL network. The three-fold network generally allows a more accurate characterization of the GW signal than a two-detector network. Previous burst searches on O3 data, in particular the LVK one [8], did not report analysis of the HLV detector network because its detection performances were found to be not as good as the ones achieved using the HL detector network. This is due to concurrent causes, including differences in spectral and directional sensitivities between the two LIGO detectors and Virgo. After removing periods affected by poor environmental conditions and detector hardware anomalies, the analyzed duration of coincident data between LIGO detectors is 206.57 days (104.94 and 101.63 days for O3a and O3b, respectively). In comparison, it is 143.3 days (75.19 and 68.11 days) for HLV. We calculated the background data set of our search by using the time-shift analysis. We accumulated 980.7 and 1096.0 years of data for the HL network for O3a and O3b, respectively, while it was 572.9 and 395.8 years for the HLV network.

Detection efficiency (hrss) is estimated by adding (i.e. injecting) selected GW signals in the detector noise over a wide range of amplitudes. For all-sky searches, the modeled source location and orientation in the sky are uniformly random. The resulting (hrss) is the fraction of detected events over injected ones at hrss amplitude with a search threshold that ensures a minimum statistical significance, such as a minimum inverse False Alarm Rate (iFAR).\nThe hrss amplitude corresponding to 50% detection efficiency, hrss50, has been widely used as a benchmark of the typical search sensitivity. Here we report hrss50 at iFAR \u2265 100 years as in [8], i.e. for rather significant detection candidates.\nDetection efficiency can also be expressed as a function of the luminosity distance r by assuming a reference\n1 More precisely, for isotropic emission hrss indicates signal strength at Earth, while for an-isotropic emissions we define hrss as the maximum amplitude emitted by the source, inversely scaled by the source distance, as in [8]\n4 amplitude value of the GW emission, hrss(r0) at some nominal distance r0:\n(r) \u2248 (hrss(r0))\u00d7 hrss(r0)/hrss(r).

Eq. 3 also describes how detection efficiency (r) scales for different assumptions on the (r0, hrss(r0)) parameters, provided that waveform morphology and spectral sensitivities of detectors are unchanged.\nDetectable volume, or sensitivity volume V, is a benchmark more directly related to the detection probability of a source population, whose spatial and GW amplitude distributions are assumed to be known. In case the source is modeled as a standard siren with a uniform spatial density and rate, the sensitive volume can be estimated by integrating the detection efficiency2 (see [70]):\nV = 4\u03c0(r0 hrss(r0))3 \u222b \u221e\n0 dhrss h4rss (hrss) (4)\nand volume V can be re-scaled for different amplitudedistance relations hrss(r0).\nThe following expression provides the energy radiated in GWs in case the emission is narrowband and isotropic:\nEGW = \u03c02c3\nG r20f 2 0h 2 rss(r0) (5)\nwhere r0 is the distance to the source and f0 is the central frequency of the GW signal. This approximation is good to within a few % for all the ad-hoc signals listed in subsection IIIA, apart from the broad-band Gaussian pulses. By using hrss50 in Eq. (5), one can benchmark the typical sensitivity of the search in terms of EGW at a reference distance (50% detection efficiency, for the selected iFAR threshold).

CS cusps and kinks propagating on string loops are expected to generate GW bursts. The CS models allow generating templates and matched filtering was used in the recent LVK search for CSs [102]. In our analysis, we adopt GW waveforms from CS cusps [60], that has been used in the search for CSs with O1 LIGO data [103] and are characterized by the amplitude, low-frequency cut-off of 1Hz and high-frequency cut-off fcutoff of 50Hz, 150Hz, 500Hz and 1500Hz. 3 For the first time, we report the cWB sensitivity on these sources, both for the standard and the ML-enhanced search. These results cannot be directly compared to the Ref.

The waveforms are calculated using effective-one-body SEOBNRv4 model [104] that includes only dominant (l,m) = (2, 2) mode.

The mass ratio ranges between 1/4 to 1.\nThe second set of binaries is intermediate-mass black hole systems. Similarly to [106], we use 46 IMBH binaries with a total mass between 120 M and 800 M , and a mass ratio from 1 to 1/10. The systems are precessing, with aligned and anti-aligned spins. These waveforms\n3 The fraction of the CSs\u2019 injected amplitudes that fall inside the analyzed frequency band is only 10%.\nare derived from Numerical Relativity simulations ( [107\u2013 109]). Each IMBH binary is uniformly distributed in sky location, inclination angle, and within a co-moving volume, optimized on the signal strength: for each signal waveform, we fix the maximum redshift by calculating conservative upper bounds on the optimal three-detector network signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to avoid generating injections well outside any possible detection range.\nThe third set contains binaries with eccentric orbits. The eBBH systems could be formed through gravitational capture in close encounters, which causes small orbital separation between the component black holes and high initial orbital eccentricity. We consider 35 mass bins which range between 100 M and 250 M , mass ratio 1, and eccentricities between 0.19 - 0.96. The simulated eBBH signals used in this analysis are obtained from Numerical Relativity simulations from [108]."

(5) by assuming a source distance of 10 kpc, 50% detection efficiency and iFAR\u2265100 years. Due to the null detection results for non-CBC GW transients, this can be interpreted as constraints on the product of luminosity distance and amplitude for burst sources. The ML-enhanced cWB improves significantly the constraints across the frequency spectrum for all tested morphologies.\nDetection range. As mentioned in Sec.II C, in the case of CCSNe models the detection efficiency can be reported as a function of luminosity distance according to Eqn. (3). Figure 4 shows examples for three CCSN models. The distances at 50% detection efficiencies are typically around 1 kpc. Similarly to the improvements in the detectable hrss50, ML-enhanced cWB allows for an average increase in the detection distance. Moreover, the enhanced algorithm significantly increases the number of detected signals at closer distances.\nSensitivity volume. Figure 5 presents a volumetric benchmark for ad-hoc and astrophysical waveforms, based on Eqn. (4). This benchmark is a proxy for the expected detection rate in case of sources uniformly distributed in volume and with a detection range within small cosmological redshifts. The sensitivity volume is mainly determined by the detection efficiency (hrss) in the lower hrss range, typically well below hrss50. This benchmark is estimated using Eqn.4 by fitting (hrss) over a measured grid of hrss values. In a few cases, namely the GA waveforms and the CS fcutoff = 50 Hz, the fits fail and Eqn.4 is estimated directly from the data points. Results in Fig. 5 assume a standard siren model with equal strength across all tested signal models to highlight dependencies on the signal morphology. We do not report sensitivity volumes for CCSNs since each model requires a specific emission strength and current detection ranges are not compatible with the assumption of uniform distribution in volume.\nThe sensitivity volume shows a systematic improvement with respect to the standard search, with the volume ratio VXGB/VSTD ranging between 1.2 \u2212 1.5 for WNBs, 1.3 \u2212 2.1 for SGs and 1.2 \u2212 2.7 for RDs. Here too, the most substantial improvements are achieved for GAs, 2.3 \u2212 4.5, and CSs, 2.4 \u2212 27, confirming that the ML-enhanced search greatly improves its discriminating\n7 GA , =0 .1 m s GA , =2 .5 m s\nSG L,\nf= 70\nHz ,Q\n=9\nSG L,\nf= 235\nHz ,Q\n=9\nSG C,\nf= 70\nHz ,Q\n=3\nSG C,\nf= 235\nHz ,Q\n=1 00\nSG C,\nf= 554\nHz ,Q\n=9\nSG C,\nf= 849\nHz ,Q\n=9\nSG E,\nf= 70\nHz ,Q\n=3\nSG E,\nf= 235\nHz ,Q\n=1 00\nSG E,\nf= 554\nHz ,Q\n=9\nSG E,\nf= 849\nHz ,Q\n=9\nWN B,\nf= 150\nHz\nWN B,\nf= 300\nHz\nWN B,\nf= 700\nHz\nAn d+\n19 s11\nMu l+1\n2 L 15\nKu r+1\n7 S FH\nx\nPo w+\n19 he3\n.5\nPo w+\n19 s18 Ra d+ 18 s13 Ra d+ 18 s25 Ra d+ 18 s9\nOc o+\n18 me\nsa2 0\nOc o+\n18 me\nsa2 0_p\nert\nAb d+\n14 A4\nO0 1.0\nRD , 0.\n5 c ycl\ne, f =7\n0H z\nRD , 0.\n5 c ycl\ne, f =2\n35 Hz\nRD , 0.\n5 c ycl\ne, f =8\n49 Hz\nRD , 1\ncyc le,\nf= 70\nHz\nRD , 1\ncyc le,\nf= 235\nHz\nRD , 1\ncyc le,\nf= 849\nHz\nRD , 2\ncyc les\n, f= 70\nHz\nRD , 2\ncyc les\n, f= 235\nHz\nRD , 2\ncyc les\n, f= 849\nHz\nCS , f cu\ntof f=\n50 Hz\nCS , f cu\ntof f=\n150 Hz\nCS , f cu\ntof f=\n500 Hz\nCS , f cu\ntof f=\n150 0H\nz\n10 22\n10 21\n10 20\nh r ss\n50 (1\n/ Hz\n)\nAd-hoc Supernova Ringdown\nCosmic String\n0. 29\n0. 25\n0. 92 0\n.9 1 0. 95 0\n.8 6\n0. 93\n0. 92\n0. 93\n0. 87\n0. 9\n0. 9\n0. 95 0. 92\n0. 91\n0. 84\n0. 93 0. 89\n0. 84 0. 81 0.\n85\n0. 86\n0. 83\n0. 86 0. 84 0.\n95 0 .8\n1 0. 31\n0. 77\n0. 9 0\n.7 7\n0. 74 0\n.9 8 0. 91\n0. 8\n0. 24 0. 37 0. 44 0. 44\nStandard search ML-enhanced search\nFIG. 2: Resulting hrss50 achieved with cWB with standard post-production veto procedure (darker colors) and with ML-enhanced cWB (lighter colors) for the HL network on full O3 and at iFAR\u2265 100 years.

Also, the sensitive volume V improves for 36 out of the 42 considered waveforms.\nAnalyzing the HLV results for O3a and O3b separately, we observe that ML-enhanced cWB search demonstrates better performance in O3a.

            "text": "This paper reports a search for generic GW burst sources on the data from the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors. We use coherent WaveBurst pipeline enhanced with machine learning to discriminate noise from signal events. The ML algorithm is trained using generic signals with stochastic morphology that do not match any known signal model. This procedure preserves the model-independent nature of the search.\nThe ML enhancement substantially improves the allsky search for burst sources. We achieved a systematic improvement of sensitivity across the very broad set of tested signal morphologies, including ad-hoc signal classes and waveforms from astrophysical sources (corecollapse supernovae, cosmic strings and ringdown waveforms). The most significant improvement in sensitivity compared to the LVK O3 search [8] is achieved for low-Q factor signals, such as cosmic strings and Gaussian pulses. In fact, the ML-enhanced algorithm is more successful in discriminating the dominant class of noise events such as blip glitches. Detection performances are measured in terms of the detectable signal amplitudes, distance ranges and space volumes. In particular, detectable amplitudes improve from a few percent to almost an order of magnitude. The ML-enhanced cWB is also more efficient in reconstructing compact binary coalescences with stellar mass and intermediate-mass black holes. These tests demonstrate that the algorithm robustly detects a wide range of short-duration GW transients.\nThis search detects more compact binaries than the previous cWB burst search, improving their significance. The results of the three-fold LIGO-Virgo detector network with O3 data are reported here for the first time. After the compact binaries are excised, we report no evidence for new GW transients for both two-fold LIGO and three-fold LIGO-Virgo detector networks."

            "text": "The ML-enhanced cWB search was introduced in Ref. [91] and updated for the O3 BBH search in Ref. [92]. We use a decision tree-based ensemble learning classifying algorithm called eXtreme-Gradient Boost (XGBoost). The cWB pipeline is utilized to reconstruct interesting events and generate summary statistics. A carefully selected subset of summary statistics is used as the list of input features for the ML model.\nIn this subsection, we discuss the necessary updates to the BBH/IMBH ML-enhanced cWB search [92], in order to tune it for the generic burst search:\nWhile the cWB search described in Ref. [92] looks for compact binary coalescence signals that do not depend on accurate waveform modeling, the generic searches should be designed for an even wider range of burst morphologies. The definitions of the summary statistics used for the O3 BBH burst search can be found in Ref. [91]. We use the following subset of the summary statistics to train XGBoost: norm (nf), cross-correlation coefficient (cc), quality of event reconstruction (\u03c72), square of SNR over likelihood (SNRi/L; where i = 0 for the HL network, and i = {0, 1} for the HLV network), effective correlated SNR (\u03b70). Additionally, we use shape parameters (Qa, Qp) which are developed to identify short-duration low-Q glitches. We exclude model-dependent summary statistics: central frequency (f0), duration (\u2206Ts), and bandwidth (\u2206Fs) as they are strongly correlated with the signal parameters like total/component masses. We also exclude the chirp parameters (chirp massM, chirp ellipticity eM) since they depend on the time-frequency evolution of the signal.\nWe use White-Noise-Burst (WNB) signals to train XGBoost, as WNBs allow probing of different regions in the time-frequency map where we expect to find GW signals. Training XGBoost on WNBs ensures the model independence of the ML-enhanced cWB generic burst search as the training set is completely independent of anticipated GW signal models. We generate two sets of WNB for training: (a) WNBs uniformly distributed in central frequency in the range [24,996] Hz, bandwidth [10,300]Hz, and duration is logarithmically distributed between 0.1ms and 1ms. (b) WNBs logarithmically distributed in central frequency [24,450]Hz, bandwidth [10,250]Hz and duration [1,50]ms. The choice of the WNB signals is largely motivated by looking at the Qa-Qp parameters and ensuring that there are no gaps left in the parameter space where we expect to find GW events. Using WNB signals instead of adhoc GW waveform signals helps in not biasing the ML\n11\nalgorithm to specific signal models.\nWe use 50% of the accumulated background for each run and generate the above-mentioned WNB signals for training. Testing is done on various GW signal simulations and the remaining background for O3a and O3b, respectively.\nWe expect to encounter GW signals with very different waveform morphology than BBH/IMBH. We start by extending the cap for the \u03b70 statistic to \u03b70 = 20 for O3a and 25 for O3b (which was earlier set to 11 for BBH/IMBH searches in the O1-O2 reanalysis paper [91], and to 20 in the O3 reanalysis paper [92]). Since the number of summary statistics used as input features was halved, we change the XGBoost hyper-parameter max_depth from 13 to 6, and min_child_weight was optimized from 10 to 5. All the other XGBoost hyperparameters are the same as reported in the O3 reanalysis paper for the BBH/IMBH search [92]. With these changes, short grid searches were performed to determine the optimal value for the user-defined weight options (introduced in Ref. [91]) for O3a (q = 5, A = 40) and O3b (q = 6, A = 80). The list of final XGBoost hyper-parameter values can be found in Table II. The same XGBoost hyper-parameters are used for both the two-fold (HL) and three-fold (HLV) networks.\nA further correction is applied to the ML penalty factor PXGB to reduce the high SNR background outliers. PXGB is ranking criteria obtained from XGBoost (see Ref. [91]). These high SNR background outliers usually correspond to a low value of Qa and Qp (especially blip glitches), and we can suppress them in the affected parameter space by\nimproving.\napplying the following correction:\nP \u2032 XGB = { PXGB \u2212 \u03b1(0.15 + \u2206Qa,p) if \u2206Qa,p \u2264 0.15 PXGB if \u2206Qa,p > 0.15\n(A1) where \u03b1 is usually equal to 1, except for HLV network on O3b data where \u03b1=3, due to the higher transient noise rate and \u2206Qa,p = Qa(Qp \u2212 0.6) defines the penalization curve in the Qa \u2212 Qp plane. More details can be found in Ref. [91]. The factor WXGB in Eq. 1 is a monotonic function of P \u2032\nXGB to increase the dynamic range.\n12\n[1] B. P. Abbott et al.
