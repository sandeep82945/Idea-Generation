    "abstractText": "Background: Psychological morbidity has been documented in medical and pharmaceutical undergraduate students in different countries around the world. In this study, we examined the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) home quarantine on the depressive psychological aspects of last-grade pharmacy students. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted by the Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Deraya University, Egypt. Two hundred and sixty-eight last-grade pharmacy students were included in this study, and they completed a self-administered, pre-designed, anonymous questionnaire. The main outcome measures were the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRS) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), which were measured to screen for the symptoms of psychological depression and determine the degree of depression severity between the beginning and the end of the COVID-19 home quarantine period. Data entry and analysis were done using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software version 26. Descriptive statistics were employed for analyses of the data, and categorical variables were described by frequencies and percentages. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were performed to examine relations between demographic data and psychological scales. The study protocol was approved by the Faculty of Pharmacy, Minia University Ethical Committee. Results: A total of 268 students participated in this study (102 males and 166 females). The mean \u00b1 SD score of baseline HRS and HRS at the end of the study was 6.3 \u00b1 4.45, 7.95 \u00b1 5.36, respectively, with the presence of a statistically significant difference between the two scores (p < 0.001). The mean \u00b1 SD score of baseline PHQ-9 and PHQ-9 at the end of the study was 4.35 \u00b1 3.45, 5.37 \u00b1 4.14, respectively, with the presence of a statistically significant difference between the two scores (p < 0.001). The results showed that the COVID-19 home quarantine period led to a depressive psychological effect on the students in this study. Conclusions: Students\u2019 psychological depression causes morbidity and, in some cases, mortality. Psychological depressive problems were significantly associated with the COVID-19 home quarantine period, which calls for early intervention to solve it. Student counselling services must be more accessible and affordable to overcome this",

            "text": "Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted by the Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Deraya University, Egypt. Two hundred and sixty-eight last-grade pharmacy students were included in this study, and they completed a self-administered, pre-designed, anonymous questionnaire. The main outcome measures were the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRS) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), which were measured to screen for the symptoms of psychological depression and determine the degree of depression severity between the beginning and the end of the COVID-19 home quarantine period. Data entry and analysis were done using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software version 26. Descriptive statistics were employed for analyses of the data, and categorical variables were described by frequencies and percentages. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were performed to examine relations between demographic data and psychological scales. The study protocol was approved by the Faculty of Pharmacy, Minia University Ethical Committee.\nResults: A total of 268 students participated in this study (102 males and 166 females). The mean \u00b1 SD score of baseline HRS and HRS at the end of the study was 6.3 \u00b1 4.45, 7.95 \u00b1 5.36, respectively, with the presence of a statistically significant difference between the two scores (p < 0.001). The mean \u00b1 SD score of baseline PHQ-9 and PHQ-9 at the end of the study was 4.35 \u00b1 3.45, 5.37 \u00b1 4.14, respectively, with the presence of a statistically significant difference between the two scores (p < 0.001). The results showed that the COVID-19 home quarantine period led to a depressive psychological effect on the students in this study.\nConclusions: Students\u2019 psychological depression causes morbidity and, in some cases, mortality. Psychological depressive problems were significantly associated with the COVID-19 home quarantine period, which calls for early intervention to solve it. Student counselling services must be more accessible and affordable to overcome this problem.\nKeywords: COVID-19, Depression, Quarantine, Students, Mental health, Pharmacy\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

WHO assumed different options to prevent\n*Correspondence: Asmaa.Mohamed@pharm.psu.edu.eg\n1 Clinical Pharmacy Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Port Said University, Port Said 42526, Egypt Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nthe introduction of the disease to new areas or to reduce human-to-human transmission, like quarantine, which means limiting the movement of people to decrease exposure to the virus [2]. Quarantine was implemented successfully as an effective measure during the SARS epidemic in 2003 [3].\nOne of the COVID-19 quarantine drawbacks is the restriction of online learning for all grades, including university. Pharmacy students are one of these groups who were asked to complete their curriculum with the aid of online sources. Psychological disorders in these students negatively affect their future, leading to decreased quality of life, lower output, and learning difficulties [4, 5]. The environment of medical colleges was considered extremely stressful and so they have been an issue of concern for many researchers [6\u20139]. Medical students are a characteristic group of people that are very sensitive and trying to fit in, maintain good grades, plan for the future. Being in quarantine away from their colleague leads to higher academic disorder, inability to manage, and may cause anxiety for many students [10]. Stress may make some students get depressed. Starting a new experiment as online learning, especially in the year of graduation can increase this depression that may cause severe problems [11]. Several studies measure depression resulting from quarantine [1, 12, 13] and all of them approved that depression is one of the signs of quarantine. Other signs such as depression, anorexia, guilt, and agitation are among serious conditions of low mood and distaste for activity that can affect an individual\u2019s thoughts, behavior, feelings, and sense of well-being. If long-lasting and with moderate or severe intensity, these problems may become a serious health condition. It can cause severe suffering and a poor job at work, school, and home. At its worst, that can lead to suicide [14, 15].\nWhile the studies mentioned above provide valuable information about how COVID-19 home quarantine/ pandemic isolation affects the psychological state of the students, the results may be different according to the country, society, type of the college, and grade of the students, the study focuses on the pharmacy students\u2019 last year. The novelty of this study lies in using two different psychological scales of depression The importance of this study lies in emphasizing the psychological effects of the COVID-19 home quarantine period on the students and its relation to some demographic data that may be modifiable to some extent, which helps to prevent negative psychological effects on the students.\nThe purpose of this study is to estimate the presence of depression among pharmacy students at Deraya University following the end of the COVID-19 home quarantine period, as well as the impact of this isolation on their psychological health state, by comparing previous data\ncollected at the start of home quarantine using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRS) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [16, 17]."

Last-grade pharmacy students at Deraya University were selected as participants. Calculation of sample size. The minimal sample size was calculated using a sample size calculator program with a 95% confidence level and 0.05 standard error. Out of the pharmacy students\u2019 last grade (n = 346), the enrollment was 346 students, but 268 students participated and completed the questionnaires (as shown in Fig.\u00a01).\nStudents who failed to fulfill all inclusion and exclusion criteria were excluded from the study. The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: full-time undergraduate students in the last grade who were \u2265 22\u00a0years of age; providing valid oral and written consent; and comprehending the questionnaire. Participants with pregnancy, a malignant tumor, a mental or psychiatric disorder, or any disease that can affect the psychological or nervous state were excluded from the present study.\nData were collected on socio-demographic characteristics. Sleep and screen time were determined by asking \u201con average, how many hours of sleep do you usually have during the daytime and night?\u201d and \u201chow many hours per day do you watch TV, computer, or mobile?\u201d physical activity index [18]. The total score for the physical activity index is the sum of multiplying intensity\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0duration\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0frequency of an exercise. The score of (81 to 100) = very active lifestyle, (60 to 80) = active and healthy; (40 to 59) = acceptable but could be better; (20 to 39) = not good enough; (Under 20) = sedentary. A selfadministered, pre-designed, anonymous questionnaire based on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRS) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) had been filled out by the students.\nThe outcome variables are: a simple questionnaire was selected to cover all the data required in this study. It was used to screen for the severity of depression. This questionnaire was self-reported by the same participants at the beginning and at the end of the COVID-19 home quarantine period for 3\u00a0months by using electronic election through Microsoft Team software. The scales that were used in this study have been validated by much research [19, 20]. The HRS is designed to rate the severity of depression in patients. The severity of depression was classified as follows: normal = (0\u20137), mild depression = (8\u201313), moderate depression = (14\u201318), severe depression = (19\u201322), and very severe depression = (> 23).\nThe PHQ-9 is a self-administered questionnaire that measures the degree of depression severity. The severity of depression was classified as follows: depression can be classified as mild (0\u20139), moderate (10\u201314), moderately severe (15\u201319), or severe (20\u201327)."

            "text": "At the beginning of the COVID-19 home quarantine, the percentages of the normal, non-depressed students in the studied sample were (69.77%) and (66.8%) and the percentages of the depressed students were (30.23%) and (33.2%) according to (HRS) and (PHQ9), respectively. After the COVID-19 home quarantine, the percentages of the normal, non-depressed students in the studied sample were (50.8%) and (53.73%) and the percentages of depressed students were (49.2%) and (46.27%) according to (HRS) and (PHQ9), respectively. Another study showed that 35.33% of university students had signs of anxiety and 72.93% of depression, although to a mild degree during the COVID-19 pandemic [25]. A preceding study revealed how young people, in particular university students, are more liable to psychological distress in pandemic disasters [26]. This suggests that the pandemic augmented common mental health conditions among the population, with a prevalence of anxiety and depression of about 32.9 and 35.3% in Asia and 23.8 and 32.4% in Europe, respectively [27]. This study reported a significant difference in scale scores in relation to gender (being a female) many studies of medical students have reported that female students experience more depression, anxiety, and stress compared to male students [28, 29]. But many studies reported no gender difference in the occurrence of depression among medical students [30]. In contrast, another study reported that male students are more prone to depression than female students [31]. A study proved an association between gender and anxiety level in which females more likely to develop anxiety symptoms due to health emergencies and obligatory quarantine than their male colleagues [32]. This association is debatable since other studies reported greater anxiety scores in males [33]. This change may be the result of cultural factors and gender-related attitudes and behaviors.\nThis study suggested that the high levels of psychological stress in females may be since female medical students are more competitive, tend to be more concerned about their grades and their performance, and they tend to exaggerate their sadness and engage in less exercise. Also, it is multifactorial, including biological, sociocultural, or varying combinations of each.\nThis study showed a significant difference in both depression scale scores that were used for family income categories, as the higher the family income, the lower the depression score and vice versa. This result is consistent with another study that observed a positive relationship between family income and a youth\u2019s symptoms of depression and anxiety [34].\nRegarding parental marital status; students residing with a father and mother in a stable family life have significantly lower scores of depression, and another study reported that men and women who have had a parental divorce since they were children are probably more depressed than those who did not [35].\nIn addition, the physical index showed a significant difference in both the depression scale scores that were used, where previous studies have shown that regular exercise reduces the incidence of depression in physiological and psychological ways. Regular practice of sport affects levels of the monoamine and endorphin neurotransmitter systems; notably, monoamines are depleted in depressed patients [36]. Psychologically exercising improves self-esteem and self-perception improves\nthrough self-actualization and benefit the satisfaction of an extended social network [37]. The level of physical activity during the quarantine acted as a defensive factor against psychological distress. The positive effect of physical activity on mental well-being has been widely shown in many studies [38, 39]. Recent studies revealed that exercising and physical activity during quarantine improves both mental and physical health [39\u201341], especially for younger people.\nLast academic performance in this study has no significant difference in both depression scale scores, this is due to the fact that concern about the disease takes everyone\u2019s attention.\nSleep time in this study showed a significant difference in both depression scale scores that were used. Students who sleep < 6\u00a0h per day and then > 8\u00a0h per day have more depression scores than students who sleep 6\u20138\u00a0h per day. These results are consistent with another study done in China [42].\nCollege students have a high rate of mental health problems was clear in this study\u2019s results. Suicide prevalence also was very high, according to the WHO proposal in 2005 [43] that was terrible results and must be put into consideration. Many participants expressed the opinion that the number of students with mental health problems was increasing and that the severity of their problems was also increasing. There was widespread agreement that the levels of stress were very high in the medical student population [44, 45].\n179(66.8%)\n65(24.2%)\n24(9%)\n0\n144(53.73%)\n81(30.22%)\n38(14.18%)\n5(1.87%) 0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\nMinimal or none Mild Depression Moderate Depression\nModerately-severe\nPHQ9D0 PHQ9D1\nFig. 3 Depression degree by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 before and after COVID-19 home quarantine period. PHQ9D score (0) = Patient Health Questionnaire-9 degree before COVID-19 Quarantine period, PHQ9D score (1) = Patient Health Questionnaire-9 degree after COVID-19 Quarantine period\nThe reason for the high percentage of symptoms being reported by pharmacy students could be a result of the obstacles in the process of learning, rigid practical work in addition to the culture of facing pandemics as a developing country. It is important for academic staff to be aware of the presence of these symptoms in their students. There is a great demand for this in colleges. Undergraduate pharmacy students should understand what is required of them and adapt as quickly as possible."

Other psychological stress problems may be associated with depression, such as suicide, guilt, insomnia, stomatitis, and agitation. Hopefully, these conditions can be stopped to prevent psychological morbidity among the college of pharmacy students and all students in general. It is clear here the important role played by the family as well as the universities in overcoming this crisis through psychological support for students and communicating with them directly with parents or online with universities for prevention, early detection, and early treatment of such cases of depression. A larger study should be done to confirm these outcomes.\nAcknowledgements The authors thank all participants of this study.\nAuthor contributions Concept: ASM, and SAM; design: ASM and SAM; supervision: AAA; materials: ASM, and SAM; data collection and processing: ORAA, and YSM; analysis and/ or interpretation: ASM, SAM, and HMA; literature review: SAM, HMA, ORAA, and YSM; writing manuscript: ASM, and HMA.
