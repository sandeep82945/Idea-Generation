Investigate the Therapeutic Potential of PNX and ALA in ACSCR: Given the anti-inflammatory and anti-edema properties of PNX and ALA, respectively, further research could explore their therapeutic potential in treating ACSCR. This could include the development of pharmaceutical compounds that mimic or enhance their action within the retinal environment.

Explore the Role of the Gut Microbiota in ACSCR Development: Since elevated TMAO levels, a metabolite associated with gut microbiota, are observed in ACSCR patients, future studies could explore the direct link between gut health, the gut-eye axis, and ACSCR. This research might include interventions aimed at modulating gut microbiota to prevent or ameliorate ACSCR.

Longitudinal Studies on the Biomarkers for Early Detection and Progression of ACSCR: Conduct longitudinal studies to assess the levels of TMAO, PNX, ALA, and SPX over time in patients with ACSCR versus healthy controls. This could help in understanding the dynamic changes in these biomarkers and their potential use in early detection, monitoring disease progression, and the effectiveness of treatment interventions.

Mechanistic Studies on the Interaction Between TMAO, PNX, ALA, SPX, and Retinal Health: Investigate the underlying mechanisms by which TMAO, PNX, ALA, and SPX influence retinal health, particularly focusing on their roles in inflammation, oxidative stress, and fluid regulation in the retina. This could involve cellular and molecular studies using retinal cells and animal models of ACSCR.

Clinical Trials for SPX as a Potential Treatment for ACSCR: Given the findings that SPX levels were significantly lower in ACSCR patients and its potential role in regulating nutrition, metabolism, and possibly reducing edema, conducting clinical trials to test SPX supplementation or SPX-mimicking drugs as a treatment for ACSCR could be a significant next step. This research would assess the efficacy, dosage, and safety of SPX in improving visual acuity and reducing macular thickness in ACSCR patients.
