Among them, the uorescence analysis method23\u201326 has been widely used for detecting Hg2+ ions. It has advantages such as high sensitivity and selectivity, fast response, low cost and suitability for in vivo detection. Given the huge advantage of uorescent materials, many uorescent materials based on gold nanoparticles,27 metal\u2013organic framework materials,28 carbon materials,29 polymer-based materials or rhodamine family compounds30 have been developed for Hg2+ ion sensing.\nConsidering the variety of luminescent sensing materials used for Hg2+ ion detection, this review will mainly focus on the recent advances in Hg2+ sensing materials based on different sensing implementation schemes. We made a systematic exposition to the design ideas and sensing mechanisms of existing Hg2+ ion sensing materials. Meanwhile, the problems and challenges in this eld are also discussed. Moreover, we hope that this review would be helpful to the researchers working on Hg2+ sensors or the other people engaged in sensing material development.\n2. Classification of mercury ion fluorescent probes\nBy 2022, hundreds of luminescent sensors that can be used for detecting Hg2+ ions were reported. These Hg2+ ion probes can be mainly classied according to their sensing mechanisms as follows:\n(1) Fluorescent sensors based on the static quenching mechanism. This type of sensor usually has uorescence, but once it coordinates with Hg2+ ions, the uorescence intensity of the resulting product would decrease signicantly, leading to an obvious \u201cturn-off\u201d uorescence phenomenon.\n(2) Fluorescent sensors involved in the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process. Some materials usually have weak uorescence due to the PET effect, but once they react with Hg2+ ions, the original PET process is suppressed, resulting in a uorescence enhancement phenomenon. In another case, the sensor did not have PET effect at the beginning, and it emitted intense uorescence. Aer the introduction of Hg2+ ions, a PET process will appear to suppress the uorescence of the sensor.\n(3) Fluorescent sensors involved in the inuence of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process. This type of sensor contains both electron withdrawing and donating groups, which would cause charge separation under the excitation of light. Its uorescence properties are greatly affected by the ICT state. When the sensor interacts with Hg2+ ions, the ICT process will be affected, resulting in the redistribution of electron density on the sensor, which will cause changes in uorescence intensity or spectrum shape.\n19430 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 19429\u201319446\n(4) Fluorescent sensors involved in aggregation-induced emission (AIE). Compounds with AIE property usually show weak or no uorescence emission at lower concentrations. Introducing Hg2+ ions can cause the aggregation of compounds, which would restrict the intramolecular motion of them, resulting in signicantly enhanced uorescence emission.\n(5) Fluorescent sensors involved in the metallophilic interaction. These sensors are mainly composed of noble metal nanoclusters (especially gold nanoclusters), which usually display \u201cturn-off\u201d uorescence upon reacting with Hg2+ ions.\n(6) Fluorescent sensors based on the mercury-induced reaction. Such sensors are not simply bound to Hg2+ ions, but when it binds to Hg2+ ions, it would cause obvious structural transformation, resulting in a change in uorescence.\n(7) Fluorescent sensors based on the changes in ligand-tometal energy transfer (LMET). This kind of sensor is usually represented by lanthanide-based uorescent materials. When Hg2+ ions interact with certain groups of the sensor, the LMET process is affected, leading to a decrease or increase in the uorescence emission of lanthanide ions.\nOf course, still there are some Hg2+ sensors which cannot be simply classied into categories depending on their design principle. In addition, the above-mentioned classication is not absolute, and many uorescent sensors oen involve multiple sensing mechanisms.31\u201335 To help readers better understand the recent development of Hg2+ ion sensors, in this review, we will divide and classify the sensors according to their main sensing mechanism (Fig. 1)."

            "text": "Static quenching is one of the most common uorescence sensing mechanisms. Generally, sensor materials have uorescence. When they combine with a quencher, a uorescent inert complex will form, causing a \u201cturn-off\u201d uorescence quenching change.36\u201338 Hg2+ ions have good coordination ability to the groups containing N, O, and S atoms, and most of the resulting complexes are uorescent inert. Therefore, researchers can design uorescence sensing materials for Hg2+ detection based on this mechanism. It is noteworthy that static quenching will not affect the uorescence lifetime (s) of the sensor. Meanwhile, such quenching can also be recovered upon the addition of some reagents with strong binding preference to Hg2+ ions, e.g., sulde or chelating agents.39\u201341 Therefore, researchers could easily decide whether the quenching mechanism is a static quenching process based on these two characteristics. Besides, the Stern\u2013Volmer equation is usually used to determine if it is static quenching or dynamic quenching, or both.42\u201344\nMasuhara et al.45 earlier reported the examples of closedshell heavy metal ion sensing based on non-uorescent complex formation and proposed a uorescence static quenching mechanism. Saleh46 has also recommended that this static quenching mechanism could be used to explain the sensing reaction involving the formation of ground-state nonuorescent complexes.

Various compounds with a crown ether structure showed sensitive uorescence turn-off properties targeting Hg2+ ions.47\u201349 Manna et al.50 prepared a porous covalent organic framework nanosheet (abbreviated as Mc-CONs) by linking the rigid diamine building block comprising cyclic naptho-1,4dithia-15-crown-5 units through a b-ketoenamine linker (Fig. 2). It was found that napthodithia-crown-ether moieties on Mc-CONs can serve as an efficient catcher for Hg2+ ions, making the electron transfer from the extended p-conjugated network of Mc-CONs to the empty orbital of Hg2+ ions. Therefore, the resulting Mc-CON has the ability to detect and effectively remove ultra-trace levels of Hg2+ ions from aqueous solution simultaneously. Besides, Mc-CONs are robust materials, and their Hg2+ ion removal efficiency would remain almost unaffected aer several cycles of regeneration over a wide range of pH 3\u20139, which makes them promising materials for the remediation of Hg2+ ion pollution.\nFig. 2 Scheme of the preparation of Mc-CON and its application in sensi ref. 50.

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nSince uorescent carbon dots (CDs) have advantages such as low toxicity, good biological compatibility, good water solubility, and high photo-stability, their application value in heavy metal detection has naturally received widespread attention.51\u201354 Functionalized CDs, especially those with surfaces rich in carboxyl, sulydryl, amino groups and so on, are easily combined with heavy metals differently, usually resulting in non-uorescent complexes, and the uorescence quenching mechanism is mainly involved in static quenching. Wu et al.55 had synthesized nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (N-CQDs) by a microwave hydrothermalmethod using citric acid and urea as sources (Fig. 3). The resulting N-CQDs emitted blue uorescence, had a high uorescence quantum yield up to 62.67%, and showed good selectivity and low detection limits to Hg2+ ion detection. The sensing behavior revealed a static quenching mechanism according to the measurement of the uorescence lifetime methods. Meanwhile, due to the good water solubility, the N-CQD was also made into a kind of uorescent invisible ink. Because N-CQDs have good biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity, they are successfully used for imaging and the detection of Hg2+ ions in HeLa cells.\nng and removing Hg2+ ions in water.

The so sulphur (S) atoms of the thiophene rings in the linker molecule can interact with the so Hg2+ ions effectively, thus provide the MOF an outstanding selectivity sensing property towards the Hg2+ ions (Fig. 4). The response time of IITG-5a in the cases of sensing Hg2+ ions was 1 min, and the corresponding limit of detection (LOD) values were as low as 5 nm. The uorescence lifetime analysis revealed no signicant change before (2.08 ns) and aer (2.07 ns) addition of Hg2+ ions, indicating that the uorescence changes followed the static quenching mechanism. IITG-5a was further used to produce test strips that showed a real-time monitoring ability to Hg2+ ions. Besides, they found that the IITG-5a could be used to detect nitrofurazone or nitrofurantoin in MeOH.\nR. V.

Based on the Stern\u2013Volmer equation, the uorescence process follows a static quenching mechanism. The LOD of FPA for Hg2+ ions is 0.34 mM as determined by uorescence spectroscopic methods. The FPA can also be used to develop a portable test strip, which can provide a rapid and straightforward detection of Hg2+ ions in all three states. Of course, many other kinds of materials could be designed and fabricated for sensing Hg2+ ions based on this mechanism.62\u201364"

That is, the electron transfer in the abovementioned process will be inhibited, leading to a \u201cturn-on\u201d uorescence behavior, realizing the sensor detection of Hg2+ ions. Extensive research has demonstrated that this \u201cturn-on\u201dtype uorescence caused by the restriction of the PET process of sensors is a very effective means of detecting Hg2+ ions.65\u201367 For example, Nolan et al.68 designed a molecular sensor with a low uorescence quantum yield due to the PET effect of the lone pair on the nitrogen atom of the aniline moiety. Coordination with Hg2+ will destroy the quenching pathway, resulting in an emission maximum red shi and a quantum yield increase, making it a useful Hg2+ ion sensor. Recently, Srivastava et al.69 have designed and synthesized a novel hydrophilic PET sensor of Hg2+ ions (Fig. 6). The sensor has an anthracene core as a uorophore along with two benzhydryl moieties and piperazine units as a suitable object acceptor because the benzhydryl and anthracene moieties connected by piperazine (the connecting arm) will form a stable hydrophilic PET system. Meanwhile, the so closed-shell cation Hg2+ has a pronounced affinity to the acceptor and promotes a stable complex in an aqueous medium, which will restrict the PET process and lead to a real-time uorescence \u201cturn-on\u201d response. The probe showed high selectivity and sensitivity for Hg2+ ions. As Hg2+ ions are gradually added to the sensor solution, a naked-eyesensitive uorescent color change (blue to blue-green) can be observed. Based on such switched-on uorescence property, they had successfully used the sensor to detect Hg2+ ions in real contaminated water samples and live cell imaging.\nIn contrast, the new reverse PET process in materials oen causes \u201curn-off\u201d uorescence, which has also been shown to be useful in designing Hg2+ ion sensors.70\u201372 Hou et al.73 synthesized a novel zinc phosphonate with a one-dimensional chain\nFig. 6 Proposed binding of Hg2+ ions to the sensor.

The as-synthesized [Zn(H4L)(2,2\n\u2032-biim)] can act as a highly selective uorescent probe for Hg2+ ions. According to the investigation of DFT calculations, the HOMO energy of 2,2\u2032- biim (acceptor) increased from \u22125.440 eV to \u22125.030 eV aer it chelated with Hg2+ ions, and was higher than the HOMO energy of H6L\u2013Zn (\u22125.133 eV, uorophore) (Fig. 7). Hence, the electron in the HOMO of 2,2\u2032-biim would transfer into the vacancy in HOMO of H6L\u2013Zn le by the excited electron, preventing the return of excited electrons in the LUMO to HOMO of H6L\u2013Zn. Thereby, [Zn(H4L)(2,2\n\u2032-biim)] exhibited a uorescence quenching property via the PET mechanism, which gave it the ability to detect Hg2+ ions.

Under the excitation of light, the electron in the donor can transfer to the acceptor (ICT), following the increase in charge separation within the uorophore.

Because the Hg2+ ion has strong affinity with electrons, it can easily combine with the donor moiety of the uorophore and affect the ICT. Meanwhile, the uorescence properties of the uorophore are greatly affected by the ICT state.\nMolecules with ICT processes and the ability to coordinate with Hg2+ ions are usually involved in the above-mentioned mechanism, making them useful Hg2+ ion sensors.74\u201380 For\nermission from ref. 69, copyright 2014, American Chemical Society.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 19429\u201319446 | 19433\nFig. 7 LUMO and HOMO energies calculated for 2,2-biim, H6L\u2013Zn and Hg\u20132,2-biim.

However, when the coordination part (which is also the electron donor) contacts a Hg2+ ion, its electron donor capacity will be decreased, resulting in the blue shi of absorption and emission spectra due to the decrease in p-electron conjugation. Thus, the molecule can be used as a uorescent sensor for detecting Hg2+ ions. Recently, Wei et al.82 have developed a novel uorescent probe DGRK based on the tripeptide (Gly\u2013 Arg\u2013Lys\u2013NH2) conjugated with a dansyl uorophore (Fig. 8). The peptide-based DGRK exhibited excellent water solubility and showed bright yellow uorescence under 365 nm UV light. However, when Hg2+ combine with the DGRKmolecule, the ICT process between the amino group of the tripeptide structure (donor) and the dansyl group (acceptor) would be changed, and the resulting DGRK\u2013Hg2+ complex only has very weak uorescence emission. They found that the uorescence of DGRK solutions can be quenched only with the addition of Hg2+ ions, and the response time is very rapid (40 s) and the sensitivity is very high (LOD = 33.6 nM). Furthermore, they had further\n19434 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 19429\u201319446\nextended the resulting DGRK\u2013Hg2+ complex to develop a S2\u2212 sensor based on the strong binding affinity of Hg2+ to S2\u2212. Additionally, due to the low toxicity and good bio-compatibility of DGRK, the authors had successfully used it to monitor Hg2+ and S2\u2212 in living cells, and developed smartphone-based test strips, which had high sensitivity, stability and selectivity for Hg2+ ion detection.\nMeng et al.83 had designed and synthesized a novel molecule composed of a conjugated uorophore structure (2,1,3-benzothiadiazole = BTD) and an acceptor moiety (rhodamine-3-acetic = RDA) (Fig. 9 top). According to DFT calculations, the electron density of HOMO and LUMO for BTD\u2013RDA is mainly localized on 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, the benzene ring and the rhodanine part, which clearly suppressed the ICT process, resulting in a weak uorescence emission.

Naturally, they have been widely used in detecting Hg2+ ions over the past dozen years.89\u2013101\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nSome molecules with thymine units can coordinate with Hg2+ ions, resulting in the AIE phenomenon.102\u2013104 Zhang et al.105 synthesized a novel AIE phosphor with a triphenylamine\u2013triazine motif and a thymine unit. The resulting compound showed very weak emission before the addition of Hg2+ ions. Upon addition of Hg2+ ions, the compounds aggregated into nanoparticles due to the coordination of thymine moieties with Hg2+ ions (Fig. 10). It had been proven that the compound is a sensitive and selective uorescent \u201cturn-on\u201d sensor for Hg2+ ions. In addition, the nano-aggregation also remarkably enhanced the two-photon uorescence of the compound. Under the excitation of an 800 nm laser, the nanoaggregator emitted intense red uorescence, making it highly desirable for biological imaging applications.\nYang et al.106 had synthesized a multiple-response uorescent compound by the condensation reaction of 5-bromosalicylaldehyde and 2-benzothiazoleacetonitrile. The resulting compound is an \u201cAIE transformer\u201d that exhibits different aggregated states in different solutions and thus emits different light. Different aggregated states give the compound the ability to detect H2S and Hg 2+ respectively. As shown in Fig. 11, Hg2+ ions can bind with the S atom and destroy the hydrogen bond (S/H\u2013N), inducing the aggregated state change from AIE (3) to AIE (4) along with markedly different uorescence emissions. Besides, they had demonstrated that such AIE transformers can be used for the selective detection of H2S and Hg 2+ in cells.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 19429\u201319446 | 19435\nFig. 9 Molecular structure of probe BTD\u2013RDA (top); HOMO\u2013LUMO energy diagrams of BTD\u2013RDAwith Hg2+ ions.

Nevertheless, once the content of water reaches 80% or above, an unexpectedly strong uorescence emission was observed. This wasmainly due to the aggregation of DBAQwhen water was added as a poor solvent, which results in an AIE\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

They had found that the uorescence intensity of the DBAQ solution in the MeCN/H2O solution (v/v = 1/9, pH = 7.5) at 600 nm dropped off sharply upon addition of excess Hg2+ ions. Meanwhile, the uorescence of the DBAQ solution changed from bright orange to colorless under a 365 nm UV lamp. They found that aer adding Hg2+ ions, the mean diameter of the DBAQ aggregator became larger instead of becoming smaller, which ruled out that the uorescence quenching was not caused by the change of DBAQ with no longer aggregation or dissolution due to the introduction of Hg2+ ions. The probable uorescence quenching mechanism of DBAQ towards Hg2+ ions (Fig. 12): (i) the combination of the nitrogen atom with Hg2+ ions interrupted the intramolecular conjugation and (ii) the resulting DBAQ\u2013Hg2+ complex has a strong spin\u2013orbit coupling effect, causing the \u201cturn-off\u201d uorescence phenomenon. Finally, they had demonstrated that\nFig. 12 Proposed sensing mechanism of DBAQ towards Hg2+. Reprodu\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nDBAQ can be used as an effectively probe for detecting Hg2+ ions in environmental water, seafood samples and living organisms. Many other reports108\u2013110 have also observed a similar phenomenon, during which static quenching may occur because the AIE phosphor and Hg2+ ions would form a uorescent inert complex. And it seems that this uorescence \u201cturnoff\u201d strategy of the AIE phosphor has a great potential application for designing effective Hg2+ ion probes."

As shown in Fig. 14, the as-synthesized compound is a vinyl ether derivative of 3-hydroxyphthalimide (denoted as MP1). When targeting Hg2+ ions, vinyl ether of MP1 would undergo a Hg2+-induced hydrolytic cleavage process, and then MP1 would turn into free ESIPT-active 3-hydroxyphthalimide, resulting in the recovery of green uorescence emission by restoring the ESIPT process. This uorescence \u201cturn-on\u201d property of MP1 had been demonstrated to be highly selective and sensitive in detecting Hg2+ ions in aqueous solutions with a low detection limit of 1.9 ppb. Besides, the MP1 had been successfully used to detect Hg2+ ions in live cells.\nIt is well known that the thymine base usually pairs with the adenine base in the DNA double helix. However, extensive research has found that a thymine will pair with another thymine via the meditation of Hg2+ ions to form a more stable thymine\u2013Hg2+\u2013thymine (T\u2013Hg2+\u2013T) pair. Since such reaction\nFig. 15 Schematic illustration of the label-free fluorescence method fo copyright 2017, Springer Nature.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The resulting T\u2013Hg2+\u2013T complex can facilitate uorescence enhancement via intercalating with SYBR Green I (SG I), which acted as a uorescent dye that had been widely used in analytic elds (Fig. 15). It had been proved to be a rapid, convenient and economic method for the detection of Hg2+ ions in environmental drinking water samples. Meanwhile, the method has high specicity for detecting Hg2+ ions, and its lowest detection limit can be as low as 3 nM.\nRecently, reaction-based uorescent probes by virtue of the strong thiophilic ability of Hg2+ ions have also attracted increasing attention.136\u2013139 Wang et al.140 had constructed\nr the detection of Hg2+.

In addition, CP\u2013Hg could be used as a biomarker for uorescence imaging of Hg2+ ions in living cells.\nRhodamine-based uorescent chemosensors are another kind of reaction-based uorescent probe of metal ions that has been widely studied. Early in 1997, Dujols et al.141 reported a pioneering work using rhodamine-B hydrazide as a uorescent chemodosimeter for Cu2+. Since then, the application of rhodamine-B-derived compounds in the eld of chemical sensing has gained great interest. There are many reviews on\nFig. 17 Proposed bindingmode of probe PS with Hg2+metal ions (X= co copyright 2021, Elsevier.\n19440 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 19429\u201319446\nrhodamine-based chemosensors reported in the past decade.142\u2013144 Yang et al.145 rst used such rhodamine-based chemodosimeters for the rapid detection of Hg2+ ions in aqueous media, and achieved an amazing detection sensitivity below 2 ppb in aqueous solutions. The sensing mechanism of these probes is mainly based on the Hg2+ ion-induced structural conversion between the spirocyclic and open-cycle forms of rhodamine unit.146\u2013149 Recently, Vanjare et al.150 have designed and synthesized a novel kind of rhodamine-based uorescent probe of Hg2+ ions based on a rhodamine 6 G molecule. As shown in Fig. 17, the as-synthesized PS molecule is nonuorescent, but a uorescence \u201cturn-on\u201d behavior was observed when it targets Hg2+ ions due to the Hg2+ ion-induced ring-opening of the spiro-cyclic structure within a rhodamine moiety. The LOD for probe PS was determined to be 30.37 nM.

            "text": "Lanthanide-based uorescent materials exhibit linear emissions, long lifetimes and relatively independent emission spectra. Generally, lanthanide-based uorescent probes are superior to others due to their strong resistance to background uorescence interference. However, because the uorescence of lanthanide materials mainly come from the f\u2013f transition of lanthanide ions while the f / f transition is parity forbidden. Fortunately, this defect can be overcome by the introduction of an \u201cantenna\u201d unit that can effectively absorb the excitation energy, and then enhance the uorescence intensity of lanthanide ions via a LMET process.151\u2013153 Interference to the LMET would inevitably lead to changes in the uorescence of lanthanide-based materials. Based on this principle, many lanthanide-based uorescent probes have been developed in recent years, including the sensor of Hg2+ ions.154\u2013162\nIn 2010, Liu et al.163 reported for the rst time a highly selective Hg2+ ion probe based on the lanthanide complex. They designed and synthesized novel pendant benzo crown ether using a benzo-15-crown-5 unit as a macrocyclic receptor and Nbenzylsalicylamide as a chromophore and coordination unit. As shown in Fig. 18 (le), the ligand L can chelate with Tb3+ ions by the oxygen atom of the amide group, while themacrocycle of the crown ether remains free. It has been proven that the assynthesized terbium complex exhibits a strong green uorescence due to the effective LMET from N-benzylsalicylamide to Tb3+ ions. Since the crown ether units still remain free and have a unique coordination capability with metal ions, the effects of various metal cations on the uorescence properties of the terbium complex were investigated. As shown in Fig. 18 (right), the terbium complex showed immediate luminescence quenching only upon addition of Hg2+ ions, which make it a highly selective and sensitive uorescent probe for detecting Hg2+ ions. It was inferred that the late reaction of the terbium complex with Hg2+ ions affected the LMET from N-benzylsalicylamide to Tb3+ ions, leading to uorescence quenching.\nThe uorescent probe based on lanthanide-functionalized MOFs has also attracted much attention as it can combine the characteristic photo-physical properties of lanthanide ions with the plentiful recognition site of MOFs.164\u2013168 Recently, Wang et al.169 have developed a novel boric acid (BA)-functionalized lanthanide MOF (BA\u2013Eu-MOF), which can be synthesized by a one-pot method with 5-boronobezene-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (5- bop) and Eu3+ ions (Fig. 19). Within the MOF, the 5-bop ligand acts as both the energy \u201cantenna\u201d of Eu3+ ions and the recognition units for Hg2+ and CH3Hg\n+ ions. Interestingly, the BA\u2013EuMOF showed weak uorescence in water because of the inefficient LMET caused by the electron-withdrawing effect of the BA\n19442 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 19429\u201319446\ngroup. But once the BA groups are replaced by Hg2+ or CH3Hg + ions, the \u201cantenna effect\u201d would be greatly enhanced, reactivating the LMET from 5-bop to Eu3+ ions. Thus, an obvious uorescence \u201cturn-on\u201d phenomenon would be observed when the BA\u2013Eu-MOF encounters Hg2+ and CH3Hg + ions. It has been proven that the BA\u2013Eu-MOF can simultaneously detect Hg2+ and CH3Hg + ions."

In part two, we gave a brief introduction to each uorescent probe from the perspective of sensing mechanism. Aerwards, the detailed sensing mechanism of each type of Hg2+ ion probe was discussed in each part, and the uorescence characteristics of various sensors were also discussed. The response mechanism and implementation strategy of various probes for sensing Hg2+ ions were also presented and highlighted through selected examples. Among these probes, except for MNCs based on the metallophilic interaction mechanism, all other probes are due to the strong electron affinity of Hg2+ ions. The high electron affinity make Hg2+ ions easy to react with groups containing O, N, S atoms or unsaturated bonds, leading to coordination and even further reactions. It should be admitted that many reports on Hg2+ ion uorescent probes are not included here, because they usually have unclear uorescence sensing mechanism. Meanwhile, some Hg2+ ion uorescent probes oen have multiple sensing mechanisms. Thus, we classify the references according to their main sensor mechanism here.\nAs mentioned above, the sensing mechanism of Hg2+ ion uorescent probes has developed to a certain extent, which can guide the design and synthesis of novel Hg2+ ion uorescent probes. Although the research on Hg2+ ion uorescent probes has made many impressive progresses, developing rapid Hg2+ ion uorescent probes is still in the exploratory stage, and its practical applications face great challenges. For example, most reported probes focus on the detection of Hg2+ ions in water samples. However, Hg2+ ions in food, medicine, cosmetics or biological samples were less detected, and most need tedious preprocessing. Although most of the studies were focused on the detection, simultaneous removal of Hg2+ ions was rarely concerned. Besides, the sensing mechanism of some Hg2+ ion uorescent probes was not clear, which hinders its further development and popularization. Therefore, to meet the increasing needs of mercury detection and pollution control, the following should be considered. First, the sensing mechanism of some Hg2+ ion uorescent probes should be further explored, which will provide clear ideas for the design of novel probes. Second, the development of sensing methods based on green solvents (e.g. ionic liquid) can avoid polluting organic solvents, as well as using the unique solvent properties of ionic liquids to adapt more objects.
