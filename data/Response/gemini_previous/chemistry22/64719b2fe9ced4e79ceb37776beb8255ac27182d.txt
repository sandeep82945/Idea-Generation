1. **Investigate the effects of AITC, BITC, and PEITC on the expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.** This could be done using quantitative real-time PCR or RNA sequencing. This would help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which these compounds inhibit bladder cancer growth and proliferation.


2. **Evaluate the effects of AITC, BITC, and PEITC on the migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells.** This could be done using in vitro scratch wound or Transwell invasion assays. This would help to determine whether these compounds can inhibit the spread of bladder cancer to other parts of the body.


3. **Investigate the effects of AITC, BITC, and PEITC on the tumor microenvironment.** This could be done by analyzing the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis, inflammation, and immune response. This would help to determine whether these compounds can modulate the tumor microenvironment in a way that is beneficial for bladder cancer patients.


4. **Evaluate the efficacy of AITC, BITC, and PEITC in combination with other bladder cancer therapies.** This could be done using in vitro or in vivo models of bladder cancer. This would help to determine whether these compounds can enhance the efficacy of standard bladder cancer treatments.


5. **Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AITC, BITC, and PEITC in bladder cancer patients.** This would be the ultimate test of whether these compounds can be used to improve the outcomes of bladder cancer patients.
