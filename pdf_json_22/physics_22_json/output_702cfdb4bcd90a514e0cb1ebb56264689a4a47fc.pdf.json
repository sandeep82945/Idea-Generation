The dynamics of global circulations which is coupled to the dynamics of the vortices is carefully taken into account. Much emphasis is put to the study of vortex pairs, having the Kimura conjecture in focus. This says that vortex pairs move, in the dipole limit, along geodesic curves, and proofs for it have previously been given by S. Boatto and J. Koiller by using Gaussian geodesic coordinates. In the present paper, we reach the same conclusion by following a slightly different route, leading directly to the geodesic equation with a reparametrized time variable. In a final section, we explain how vortex motion in planar domains can be seen as a special case of vortex motion on closed surfaces.",

            "text": "This paper extends previous results in Gustafsson (2019) on multiple point vortex motion on closed Riemannian surfaces of arbitrary genus to cases in which the sum of the vorticities is not zero, and therefore a counter-vorticitymust be present. This occurs for example when there is only one-point vortex. For reasons dictated by a Hodge decomposition, the counter-vorticity is naturally chosen to be uniformly distributed on the surface.\nCommunicated by George Haller.\nB Bj\u00f6rn Gustafsson gbjorn@kth.se\n1 Department of Mathematics, KTH, 100 44 Stockholm, Sweden\nSpecial for our investigations is that we, in the case of higher genus, carefully take the circulation around the holes into account and make sure that the Kelvin law of preservation of circulations is satisfied. This was done already in Gustafsson (2019), but in the case of a counter-vorticity being present one has to take some extra steps. It is natural to choose fixed closed curves on the surface to make up a basis for the first homology group, but the circulation around such curves will in general not be conserved in time. We handle the so arising problem by considering these circulations as free variables in the phase space, in addition to the locations of the vortices. If there are n vortices and the genus of the surface is g, the phase space will thus have real dimension 2n + 2g.\nThe Hamiltonian function will, as usual, be a renormalized kinetic energy for the flow, see (5.28), but in the presence of a counter-vorticity the symplectic form has to be accordingly adapted, see (6.1). With this done the dynamical equations come out to be the expected ones (Theorem 6.1). After having set up the vortex dynamics in general (Sects. 5 and 6) and after a short discussion of the single vortex case in genus zero (Sect. 7), we turn in Sect. 8 to the question of motion of vortex pairs, i.e., systems consisting of two point vortices of equal strength but rotating in the opposite direction. In this case, there is no counter-vorticity. The conjecture of Kimura (1999), saying that a vortex pair in the dipole limit moves along a geodesic curve, has been a major source of inspiration for the present paper. The same applies for papers (Koiller and Boatto 2009; Boatto and Koiller 2015) by S. Boatto, J. Koiller. These latter papers actually contain a proof of Kimura\u2019s conjecture, and in the present paper we try to clarify the situation further by connecting the dipole trajectory directly to the geodesic equation associated with the metric.\nThroughout this paper, we think of a Riemannian surface (a Riemannian manifold of dimension two) as a Riemann surface provided with a metric which is compatible with the conformal structure, and hence can be written on the form\nds = \u03bb(z)|dz|. (1.1)\nWe are then led into more or less classical function theory on Riemann surfaces. Our treatment is based entirely on local holomorphic coordinates. For example, the logarithmic singularities in the stream function will look like, up to a constant factor,\n\u03c8(z) = log |z \u2212 w| \u2212 c0(w) + O(|z \u2212 w|)\nnear a point vortex located atw. Here, the constant term c0(w) is a kind of \u201cconnection\u201d (0-connection, up to a sign, in our terminology). In potential theory, it is known as a capacity function, or \u201cRobin function\u201d if \u03c8 is viewed as a Green function, and in fluid dynamics it goes under the name \u201cRouth\u2019s stream function,\u201d a kind of stream function for the motion of the vortex. It has an inhomogeneous transformation law, which can be translated into saying that\nds = e\u2212c0(w)|dw|\nis a conformally invariant Riemannianmetric (usually not identical with (1.1) though).\nThe corresponding flow field \u03bd = (\u2202\u03c8/\u2202 y)dx\u2212(\u2202\u03c8/\u2202x)dy = \u2212\u2217d\u03c8 , considered here as a one-form or a covariant vector field, looks like\n\u03bd(z) = dz z \u2212 w \u2212 c1(w)dz + complex conjugates + O(|z \u2212 w|)\nnear the vortex point. The term named \u201ccomplex conjugates\u201d is inserted tomake possible for \u03bd to be real-valued. Also in this expansion, the constant term is a \u201cconnection.\u201d More precisely,\nrrobin(w) = \u22122c1(w)\nis an affine connection (or 1-connection in our terminology) in the sense of differential geometry. It appears in expressions for covariant derivatives, and after subtraction of the affine connection\nrmetric(w) = 2 \u2202 \u2202w log \u03bb(w)\nderived from the metric (1.1) it gives the speed of the vortex. Indeed, citing from Gustafsson (2019) (Lemma 7.1 there) this speed is given by\n\u03bb(w)2 dw\ndt = 4\u03c0 i\n( rmetric(w) \u2212 rrobin(w) ) , (1.2)\nwhere is the strength of the vortex. This formula is also implicitly contained in Theorem 6.1 in the present paper.\nOne step further, it is possible to proceed directly to dipole flow by differentiating with respect to w:\ndw\u03bd(z) = dzdw (z \u2212 w)2 \u2212 2c2(w)dzdw + complex conjugates + regular terms.\nAgain the constant term defines a connection. To be precise, q(w) = \u22126c2(w) is a projective, or Schwarzian, connection (or 2-connection); see Sect. 4, aswell as relevant parts of Gustafsson (2019). This term gives some pieces of information on the fine structure of the flow near the dipole; however, it seems not to be directly related to the speed of the dipole. The differential dw is to contain information about the orientation of the dipole and can be used to specify in which direction it is going to move. Indeed, all evidence shows that the dipolemoveswith infinite speed along the geodesic directed perpendicular to its orientation. This is Kimura\u2019s conjecture, which was confirmed in Koiller and Boatto (2009) and Boatto and Koiller (2015) and which we make attempts to further clarify in the present paper.\nSpecifically, we show that the equations of motion for a vortex pair in a suitably scaled dipole limit reduce to the geodesic equation for the center w of the dipole. We write this geodesic equation on the form\nd dt arg dw dt + Im (rmetric(w)dw dt ) = 0, (1.3)\nwith t being an arbitrary parameter, for example, Euclidean arc length. See Theorem 8.1.\nThe Kimura conjecture and other matters related to dipole motion have been discussed also in Smith (2011), Smith andNagem (2013), Rodrigues et al. (2018), Koiller (2020), Krishnamurthy et al. (2021), and from slightly different points of view in Chorin (1973), Kulik et al. (2010), Holm and Jacobs (2017), and Cawte et al. (2019). It may be remarked that Kimura\u2019s conjecture is counterintuitive. The reason to think so is that vortex motion in general is governed by global laws on the manifold, like the structure of Green functions and other harmonic functions, whereas the geometry of geodesics is an entirely local matter. If the geometry of the manifold is changed at one place, then this will not affect what geodesics look like at another place. It will, however, change the structure of Green functions and the general vortex dynamics everywhere. The solution of this paradox is that vortex dipoles are highly singular. A vortex pair is partly governed by the global harmonic structure, but in the limit, when the vortex pair becomes a dipole, this harmonic structure is completely overruled by the differential geometric structure. In that limit, all terms in the dynamical equations containing harmonic functions become negligible compared to those terms depending on the metric only. This fact shows up in the two dynamical equations above: The motion (1.2) of a single vortex is governed by rmetric(w) and rrobin(w) to equal parts, whereas only rmetric(w) appears in equation (1.3) for a dipole. See Sect. 8 for further details.\nIn the final section of the paper, we discuss how point vortex motion in planar domains can be considered as a special case of vortex motion on surfaces. This is done by doubling the domain to a compact Riemann surface (the Schottky double), which is a standard tool as far as the conformal structure is concerned. What is special in our case is that we have to take the metric structure into account, and this becomes non-smooth in the doubling procedure. An interesting observation is that the boundary of the domain becomes a geodesic curve with respect to the natural planar metric (on each of the halves) of the Schottky double.\nIn general, the present paper is, in addition to the papers by S. Boatto and J. Koiller already mentioned, much in spirit of papers (Smith 2011; Smith and Nagem 2013; Ragazzo 2017; Ragazzo and Viglioni 2017; Wang 2021) by S. G. Llewellyn Smith, R. J.Nagem,C.GrottaRagazzo,H.Viglioni, andQ.Wang.Thepaper (Bogatskiy 2019) by A. Bogatskiy contains ideas concerning the higher genus case which are somewhat similar to those in the present paper; see in particular Section A.3 in Bogatskiy (2019). We wish to mention also the work (Borisov and Mamaev 2006) by A. V. Borisov and I. S. Mamaev, and the very early article (Fridman and Polubarinova 1928) (cited in Borisov andMamaev 2006; Smith and Nagem 2013) by A. A. Fridman and P. Ya. Polubarinova. That work, from 1928, may be one of the first papers on motion of dipoles and other higher singularities."

            "text": "Weconsider the dynamics of a non-viscous incompressible fluid on a compactRiemannian manifold of dimension two. We follow the treatments in Schutz (1980), Arnold and Khesin (1998), and Frankel (2012) in the respects of treating the fluid velocity field as a one-form and in extensively using the Lie derivative. These sources also provide the standard notions and notations for differential geometry to be used. Other treatises in fluid dynamics, suitable for our purposes, are Marchioro and Pulvirenti (1994) and Newton (2001).\nTraditionally, non-viscous fluid dynamics is discussed in terms of the fluid velocity vector field v, the density \u03c1, and the pressure p of the fluid. The basic equations are the equation of continuity (expressing conservation of mass) and Euler\u2019s equation (conservation of momentum):\n\u2202\u03c1 \u2202t + \u2207 \u00b7 (\u03c1v) = 0, (2.1) \u2202v \u2202t + (v \u00b7 \u2207)v = \u2212 1 \u03c1 \u2207 p. (2.2)\nThese are to be combined with a constitutive law giving a relationship between p and \u03c1. We shall take that to be the simplest possible: \u03c1 = 1. Thus, \u03c1 disappears from discussion, and the equation of continuity becomes\n\u2207 \u00b7 v = 0. (2.3)\nOne can get rid also of p, because when \u03c1 is constant, p appears only as a scalar potential in Euler\u2019s equation, this equation effectively saying that\n\u2202v \u2202t + (v \u00b7 \u2207)v = \u2207(something), (2.4)\nwhere this \u201csomething\u201d = p afterward can be recovered, up to a (time dependent) constant.\nSo everything is extremely simple (in theory), and even more so in two dimensions. As is well known, every (oriented) Riemannian manifold of dimensions two can be made into a Riemann surface by choosing isothermal local coordinates (x, y) = (x1, x2), by which z = x + iy becomes a holomorphic coordinate and the metric takes the form\nds2 = \u03bb(z)2|dz|2 = \u03bb(z)2(dx2 + dy2) (2.5)\nwith \u03bb > 0. Thus, the metric tensor gi j , as appearing in general in ds2 = gi jdxidx j , becomes gi j = \u03bb2\u03b4i j in these coordinates. It turns out to be convenient to work with the fluid velocity 1-form (or covariant vector)\n\u03bd = \u03bdx dx + \u03bdy dy\nrather than with the corresponding vector field, which then becomes\nv = 1 \u03bb2\n( \u03bdx \u2202\n\u2202x + \u03bdy \u2202 \u2202 y\n) .\nThe Hodge star operator takes 0-forms into 2-forms and vice versa and takes 1- forms to 1-forms. It acts on basic differential forms as\n\u22171 = \u03bb2(dx \u2227 dy) = vol = the volume (area) form, \u2217dx = dy, \u2217dy = \u2212dx, \u2217(dx \u2227 dy) = \u03bb\u22122.\nThus, for 1-forms,\n\u2217\u03bd = \u2212\u03bdy dx + \u03bdx dy,\nwhich can be interpreted as a rotation by ninety degrees of the corresponding vector. In addition to the Hodge star, it is useful to introduce the Lie derivative Lv of a vector field v. When acting on differential forms, this is related to interior derivation (or \u201ccontraction\u201d) i(v) and exterior derivation d by the homotopy formula\nLv = d \u25e6 i(v) + i(v) \u25e6 d. (2.6)\nThe Hodge star and interior derivation are related by\ni(v)vol = \u2217\u03bd, (2.7)\nwhere v and \u03bd are linked via the metric tensor as above. Thus,\nd \u2217 \u03bd = d(i(v)vol) = Lv(vol) = (\u2207 \u00b7 v)vol.\nSee Frankel (2012) for this identity, and for further details in general. We conclude that (2.3) is equivalent to the statement that \u2217\u03bd is a closed form:\nd \u2217 \u03bd = 0. (2.8)\nLocally, we can therefore write\n\u2217 \u03bd = d\u03c8 (2.9)\nfor some (locally defined) stream function \u03c8 . The vorticity 2-form for a fluid is, in terms of the flow 1-form \u03bd,\n\u03c9 = d\u03bd = ( \u2202\u03bdy\n\u2202x \u2212 \u2202\u03bdx \u2202 y\n) dx \u2227 dy. (2.10)\nThe Euler equation (2.2) can be written\n( \u2202\n\u2202t + Lv\n) (\u03bd) = d ( 1\n2 |v|2 \u2212 p\n) . (2.11)\nNote that the left member involves the fluid velocity both as a vector field and as a form. The combination \u2202\n\u2202t +Lv can be viewed as a counterpart, for forms, to the more traditional \u201cconvective derivative\u201d (or material derivative) \u2202\n\u2202t +v \u00b7\u2207, implicitly used in (2.4), for vector fields. However, the two derivatives are not the same. The equivalence between (2.11) and (2.2) (when \u03c1 = 1) is a consequence of the identity\nLv\u03bd = d ( 1\n2 |v|2\n) + (v \u00b7 \u2207)\u03bd,\nwhich can be directly verified by coordinate computations. See Schutz (1980), Frankel (2012) for details.\nSince the pressure p does not appear in any other equation, the Euler equation on the form (2.11) only expresses, in analogy with (2.4), that the left member is an exact 1-form:\n( \u2202\n\u2202t + Lv\n) (\u03bd) = exact = d\u03c6. (2.12)\nFrom the scalar \u03c6 the pressure p then can be recovered via\n\u03c6 = 1 2 |v|2 \u2212 p + constant. (2.13)\nOn acting by d on (2.12), the local form of Helmholtz\u2013Kirchhoff\u2013Kelvin law of conservation of vorticity follows:\n( \u2202\n\u2202t + Lv\n) (\u03c9) = 0. (2.14)\nSince the right member of (2.12) is not only a closed differential form, but even an exact form, a stronger, global, version of theHelmholtz\u2013Kirchhoff\u2013Kelvin lawactually follows. This can be expressed by saying that\nd\ndt\n\u222e\n\u03b3 (t) \u03bd = 0\nfor any closed curve \u03b3 (t) which moves with the fluid."

            "text": "In the sequel, M will be a closed (compact) Riemann surface provided with a Riemannian metric on the form (2.5).\nGiven a 2-form \u03c9 on M , one can immediately obtain a corresponding Green potential G\u03c9 by Hodge decomposition, i.e., by orthogonal decomposition in the Hilbert space of square integrable 2-forms. The inner product for such forms is\n(\u03c91, \u03c92)2 = \u222b\nM \u03c91 \u2227 \u2217\u03c92. (3.1)\nThe given 2-form \u03c9 then decomposes as the orthogonal decomposition of an exact form and a harmonic form:\n\u03c9 = d(something) + harmonic.\nThis Hodge decomposition can more precisely be written as\n\u03c9 = \u2212d \u2217 dG\u03c9 + constant \u00b7 vol, (3.2)\nwhere G\u03c9 is normalized to be orthogonal to all harmonic 2-forms, namely satisfying\n\u222b\nM G\u03c9 vol = 0. (3.3)\nThe constant in (3.2) necessarily equals the mean value of \u03c9,\nconstant = 1 V\n\u222b\nM \u03c9, (3.4)\nwhere V denotes the total volume (=area) of M :\nV = \u222b\nM vol.\nWhen \u03c9 is exact, as in (2.10), the second term in the right member of (3.2) disappears, hence\n\u2212 d \u2217 dG\u03c9 = \u03c9 (3.5)\nin this case. In the other extreme, when \u03c9 is harmonic, i.e., is a constant multiple of vol, the first term disappears. Indeed, the whole Green function disappears:\nGvol = 0. (3.6)\nFor 1-forms, the inner product has the same expression as for 2-forms:\n(\u03bd1, \u03bd2)1 = \u222b\nM \u03bd1 \u2227 \u2217\u03bd2. (3.7)\nIf \u03bd represents a fluid velocity, then (\u03bd, \u03bd)1 is the kinetic energy of the flow (up to a factor). For a function (potential) u, we consider the Dirichlet integral (du, du)1 to be its energy. Thus, constant functions have no energy.\nThe energyE(\u03c9, \u03c9) of any 2-form\u03c9 is defined to be the energy of itsGreen potential G\u03c9. Thus, for the mutual energy,\nE(\u03c91, \u03c92) = (dG\u03c91 , dG\u03c92)1 = \u222b\nM G\u03c91 \u2227 \u03c92. (3.8)\nIt follows, from (3.3) for example, that the volume form has no energy:\nE(vol, vol) = 0.\nIt was tacitly assumed above that the forms under discussion belong to the L2space defined by the inner product. However, the mutual energy sometimes extends to circumstances in which source distributions have infinite energy. This applies in particular to the Dirac current \u03b4a , which we consider as a 2-form with distributional coefficient, namely defined by the property that\n\u222b\nM \u03b4a \u2227 \u03d5 = \u03d5(a)\nfor every smooth function \u03d5. Certainly \u03b4a has infinite energy, but if a = b, then E(\u03b4a, \u03b4b) is still finite and has a natural interpretation: It is the (one-point) Green function, or \u201cmonopole\u201d Green function:\nG(a, b) = G\u03b4a (b) = E(\u03b4a, \u03b4b). (3.9)\nHere, the first equality can be taken as a definition, and then the second equality follows on using (3.2) and (3.3):\nE(\u03b4a, \u03b4b) = \u222b\nM dG\u03b4a \u2227 \u2217dG\u03b4b = \u2212\n\u222b\nM G\u03b4a \u2227 d \u2217 dG\u03b4b\n= \u222b\nM G\u03b4a \u2227\n( \u03b4b \u2212 1\nV vol\n) = G\u03b4a (b) = G(a, b).\nThis shows in addition that G(a, b) is symmetric. Changing now notations from a, b to z, w, where laterw will have the role of being the location of a point vortex, the Green function G(z, w), as a function of z, has just\none pole (at z = w). Its Laplacian, as a 2-form, is then\n\u2212 d \u2217 dG(\u00b7, w) = \u03b4w \u2212 1 V vol. (3.10)\nIt is interesting to notice that among the two terms in the right member of (3.10), one has infinite energy and one has zero energy (E(\u03b4w, \u03b4w) = +\u221e, E(vol, vol) = 0). Remark 3.1 It is more common to treat the Dirac delta and the Laplacian (denoted ) as \u201cdensities\u201dwith respect to the volume form.However, we find our usage convenient. In any case, the relationships are\n\u03b4a = (delta \u201cfunction\u201d) vol, d \u2217 d\u03d5 = ( \u03d5) vol.\nRemark 3.2 (Notational remark) Letters like z, w will have the double roles of being complex-valued local coordinates on parts of the Riemann surface and of denoting the points on the surface for which the coordinates have the values in question. A more formal treatment could use, for example, P \u2208 M for a point and z(P) \u2208 C for the corresponding coordinate value.\nRemark 3.3 (Real versus complex notation) For future needs, we wish to clarify the relationship between real and complex coordinates in the context of tangent and cotangent vectors.\nLet z = x + iy be a complex coordinate on M and consider a curve t \u2192 z(t) in M (for example the trajectory of a vortex). Set z\u0307 = dz/dt , and similarly for x\u0307 and y\u0307, so that z\u0307 = x\u0307 + i y\u0307. The velocity of this moving point is primarily to be considered as a vector in the (real) tangent space of M (at the point under consideration). This gives, in the picture of viewing tangent vectors as derivations, the velocity vector\nV = x\u0307 \u2202 \u2202x + y\u0307 \u2202 \u2202 y = z\u0307 \u2202 \u2202z + \u02d9\u0304z \u2202 \u2202 z\u0304 , (3.11)\nwhere it is understood that \u02d9\u0304z = z\u0307. The real tangent space used above can in a next step be complexified, which means that one breaks the connection between z\u0307 and \u02d9\u0304z and consider them as independent complex variables. Equivalently, one allows x\u0307 and y\u0307 to be complex-valued. The so obtained complex tangent space can be decomposed as a direct sum of its holomorphic and anti-holomorphic subspaces, and then\nproj : V = z\u0307 \u2202 \u2202z + \u02d9\u0304z \u2202 \u2202 z\u0304 \u2192 z\u0307 \u2202 \u2202z\nbecomes a natural and useful identification of the real tangent space with the holomorphic part of the complex tangent space. See Griffiths and Harris (1978), in particular Section 2 of Chapter 0, for further discussions. With this identification, z\u0307 represents the velocity of z(t). Still one needs to keep in mind that z\u0307 is just a complex number and that it is rather the preimage under proj above that is the true velocity, as a real tangent vector.\nThe vector V above corresponds, via the metric, to the covector\n\u03bb2(x\u0307dx + y\u0307dy) = \u03bb 2\n2 ( \u02d9\u0304zdz + z\u0307dz\u0304), (3.12)\nwhere \u03bb = \u03bb(x, y) = \u03bb(z) (depending on context). Note that 1\n2 \u02d9\u0304z = 1 2 (x\u0307 \u2212 i y\u0307), 1 2 z\u0307 = 1 2 (x\u0307 + i y\u0307),\nas coefficients of dz and dz\u0304 (respectively) have similar roles (and signs) as theWirtinger derivatives \u2202/\u2202z, \u2202/\u2202 z\u0304. For a covector \u03bd in general, we therefore define\n\u03bdz = 1 2 (\u03bdx \u2212 i\u03bdy), \u03bdz\u0304 = 1 2 (\u03bdx + i\u03bdy),\nso that\n\u03bd = \u03bdxdx + \u03bdydy = \u03bdzdz + \u03bdz\u0304dz\u0304.\nThe corresponding (contravariant) vector is then, as in our fluid dynamical contexts,\nv = 1 \u03bb2\n( \u03bdx \u2202\n\u2202x + \u03bdy \u2202 \u2202 y\n) = 1\n\u03bb2\n( \u03bdz \u2202\n\u2202z + \u03bdz\u0304 \u2202 \u2202 z\u0304\n) ."

            "text": "Besides differential forms, and tensor fields in general, certain kinds of connections with inhomogeneous transformation laws are relevant for point vortex motion. These arise naturally under \u201crenormalization\u201d processes, more precisely as the first regular terms in expansions of a polar singularities. The affine connections have the same meanings as in ordinary differential geometry, used to define covariant derivatives for example, and they play an important role in many areas of mathematical physics.\nSome general references for the kind of connections we are going to consider are Schiffer and Hawley (1962), Gunning (1966, 1967, 1978), Gustafsson and Sebbar (2012). We define them in the simplest possible manner, namely as quantities defined in terms of local holomorphic coordinates and transforming in specified ways when changing from one coordinate to another.\nLet z\u0303 = \u03d5(z) represent a holomorphic local change of complex coordinate on a Riemann surface M and define three nonlinear differential expressions {\u00b7, \u00b7}k , k = 0, 1, 2, by\n{z\u0303, z}0 = log\u03d5\u2032(z), {z\u0303, z}1 = (log\u03d5\u2032(z))\u2032 = \u03d5 \u2032\u2032\n\u03d5\u2032 ,\n{z\u0303, z}2 = (log\u03d5\u2032(z))\u2032\u2032 \u2212 1 2 ((log\u03d5\u2032(z))\u2032)2 = \u03d5\n\u2032\u2032\u2032\n\u03d5\u2032 \u2212 3 2\n( \u03d5\u2032\u2032\n\u03d5\u2032\n)2 .\nThe last expression is the Schwarzian derivative of \u03d5. For {z\u0303, z}0, there is an additive indeterminacy of 2\u03c0 i, so actually only its real part, or exponential, is completely well defined. If z depends on w via an intermediate variable u, then the following chain rule holds:\n{z, w}k(dw)k = {z, u}k(du)k + {u, w}k(dw)k (k = 0, 1, 2).\nDefinition 4.1 An affine connection (or 1-connection) on M is an object which is represented by local differentials r(z)dz, r\u0303(z\u0303)dz\u0303,\u2026(one in each coordinate variable, and not necessarily holomorphic) glued together according to the rule\nr\u0303(z\u0303)dz\u0303 = r(z)dz \u2212 {z\u0303, z}1 dz.\nDefinition 4.2 A projective connection (or Schwarzian connection, or 2-connection) on M consists of local quadratic differentials q(z)(dz)2, q\u0303(z\u0303)(dz\u0303)2, \u2026, glued together according to\nq\u0303(z\u0303)(dz\u0303)2 = q(z)(dz)2 \u2212 {z\u0303, z}2 (dz)2.\nOne may also consider 0-connections, assumed here to be real-valued. Such a connection p(z) transforms according to\np\u0303(z\u0303) = p(z) \u2212 Re{z\u0303, z}0.\nThis means exactly that\nds = ep(z)|dz|\nis a Riemannian metric. For a metric in general, ds = \u03bb(z)|dz| = ep(z)|dz|, there is a natural affine connection r(z) = r(z)metric associated with it by\nr(z) = 2 \u2202 \u2202z log \u03bb = 2\u2202 p \u2202z = \u2202 p \u2202x \u2212 i\u2202 p \u2202 y . (4.1)\nThis can be identified with the Levi-Civita connection in general tensor analysis. The real and imaginary parts coincide (up to sign) with the components of the classical Christoffel symbols ki j . The Gaussian curvature of the metric is\n\u03ba = \u22124\u03bb\u22122 \u2202 2 \u2202z\u2202 z\u0304 log \u03bb = \u22122\u03bb\u22122 \u2202r \u2202 z\u0304 .\nThe equation for geodesic curves z = z(t) is\nd2z dt2 + r(z)\n( dz\ndt\n)2 = 0,\nwhere t is the arc length with respect to the metric. Written in another way,\nd dt log dz dt + r(z)dz dt = 0. (4.2)\nThe first version is just a reformulation of the usual equation in terms of Christoffel functions in ordinary differential geometry (see Frankel 2012), and it is also discussed in a complex analytic context in Gustafsson and Sebbar (2012).\nThe real part of (4.2) only contains information about the parametrization, while the imaginary part, namely\nd dt arg dz dt + Im\n( r(z) dz\ndt\n) = 0 (4.3)\ndescribes the geodesic curve in terms of an arbitrary real parameter t . The latter property is useful in the context of the motion of vortex pairs since the speed of such a pair tends to infinity as the distance between the two vortices goes zero, and time therefore has to be successively reparametrized."

It follows that (twice) the total (kinetic) energy (\u03bd, \u03bd)1 of the flow is given by\n\u222b\nM \u03bd \u2227 \u2217\u03bd =\n\u222b\nM dG\u03c9 \u2227 \u2217dG\u03c9 +\n\u222b\nM \u03b7 \u2227 \u2217\u03b7 = E(\u03c9, \u03c9) +\n\u222b\nM \u03b7 \u2227 \u2217\u03b7\n= \u222b\nM G\u03c9 \u2227 \u03c9 + g\u2211 j=1\n(\u222e\n\u03b1 j\n\u03b7\n\u222e\n\u03b2 j\n\u2217\u03b7 \u2212 \u222e\n\u03b1 j\n\u2217\u03b7 \u222e\n\u03b2 j\n\u03b7 ) .\nWe shall now specialize on the point vortex case, having point vortices of strengths k located at points wk \u2208 M (k = 1, . . . , n). However, we shall not assume that these strengths add up to zero. Hence, the sum\n= n\u2211\nk=1 k (5.3)\nmay be nonzero and there will then be a compensating uniform counter-vorticity. The total vorticity \u03c9 = d\u03bd, which satisfies \u222bM \u03c9 = 0, appears as the right member in\n\u2212 d \u2217 dG\u03c9 = \u03c9 = n\u2211\nk=1 k\u03b4wk \u2212 V vol. (5.4)\nExplicitly, we have (recall (3.6))\nG\u03c9(z) = n\u2211\nk=1 kG(z, wk). (5.5)\nOn using (3.13), the conjugate \u03b1-periods of G\u03c9 can be expressed as\n\u222e\n\u03b1 j\n\u2217dG\u03c9 = \u2212 n\u2211\nk=1 2i k\n\u222e\n\u03b1 j\n\u2202G(z, wk)\n\u2202z dz. (5.6)\nBy differentiation and using also (3.15) and (3.16) (with \u03b3 = \u03b1 j ), we find that\n\u2202\n\u2202wk\n\u222e\n\u03b1 j\n\u2217dG\u03c9 = k \u2202U\u03b1 j (wk)\n\u2202wk = i k \u2202U\u2217\u03b1 j (wk) \u2202wk , (5.7)\n\u2202\n\u2202wk\n(\u222e\n\u03b1 j\n\u2217dG\u03c9 ) dwk = k\n2 (dU\u03b1 j (wk) + i \u2217 dU\u03b1 j (wk)). (5.8)\nHere, U\u2217\u03b1 j denotes a harmonic conjugate of U\u03b1 j , whereby \u2217dU\u03b1 j = d(U\u2217\u03b1 j ). Similar relations hold for periods around \u03b2 j , and for w\u0304k derivatives.\nThe expression for the kinetic energy can in the point vortex case be written, at least formally,\n(\u03bd, \u03bd)1 = n\u2211\nk, j=1 k j G(wk, w j ) + g\u2211 j=1\n(\u222e\n\u03b1 j\n\u03b7\n\u222e\n\u03b2 j\n\u2217\u03b7 \u2212 \u222e\n\u03b1 j\n\u2217\u03b7 \u222e\n\u03b2 j\n\u03b7 ) .\nHowever, the presence of the terms 2kG(wk, wk)makes the first term become infinite. In order to renormalize this singular behavior, we isolate the logarithmic pole in the Green function by writing\nG(z, w) = 1 2\u03c0 (\u2212 log |z \u2212 w| + H(z, w)), (5.9)\nand expand, for a fixed w, the regular part in a power series in z as\nH(z, w) = h0(w) + 1 2\n( h1(w)(z \u2212 w) + h1(w)(z\u0304 \u2212 w\u0304) ) +\n+ 1 2\n( h2(w)(z \u2212 w)2 + h2(w)(z\u0304 \u2212 w\u0304)2 )\n+ h11(w)(z \u2212 w)(z\u0304 \u2212 w\u0304) + O(|z \u2212 w|3). (5.10)\nWe note from (5.10) that\nH(w,w) = h0(w), { \u2202H(z, w)\n\u2202z\n}\nz=w = 1 2 h1(w). (5.11)\nThus, the symmetry of H(z, w) gives\nh1(w) = \u2202h0(w) \u2202w , (5.12)\nIn Gustafsson (2019), the behavior of the coefficients in the expansion (5.10) under conformal mapping was discussed. For example, the coefficient h11(w) transforms as the density of a metric, and it is indeed proportional to the given metric:\nh11(w) = \u03c0 2V \u03bb(w)2. (5.13)\nThe coefficients h0(w), h1(w) and h2(w) are subject to inhomogeneous transform laws, expressing that they, in certain combinations, behave as connections under conformal mappings.\nFor h0(w), the law is\nh\u03030(w\u0303) = h0(w) + Re{w\u0303, w}0,\nand this means that its exponential defines a metric, namely the Robin metric via\nds = e\u2212h0(w)|dw|. (5.14)\nMetrics of this kind are implicit in the theory of capacity functions, as exposed in Sario and Oikawa (1969). It should be pointed out that our version of the Robin metric depends on the given metric, since the Green function itself depends on it. The Robin metric can also be adapted to given global circulations, and then it becomes more intrinsically hydrodynamic in nature. The coefficient h0(w) is one example of a (coordinate) Robin function.\nNow, letting w have the role of being a vortex point indicates that one could renormalize the kinetic energy by simply discarding the singular term log |z \u2212 w|, as this seems at first sight to produce just a circular symmetric flow, not affecting the speed of the vortex. However, this is not fully correct in the case of curved surfaces. The term log |z \u2212 w| cannot be just removed; it needs be replaced by a term which counteracts the above inhomogeneous transformation law of h0(w). Such a term comes naturally from the given metric ds = \u03bb(w)|dw| = elog \u03bb(w)|dw|. We see that minus log \u03bb(w) has the right properties, and it combines with h0(w) into\nRrobin(w) = 1 2\u03c0 (h0(w) + log \u03bb(w)). (5.15)\nThis is indeed a function, the Robin function, and it appears naturally when writing the singularity of the Green function in terms of the distance with respect to the given Riemannian metric:\nG(z, w) = \u2212 1 2\u03c0 log dist(z, w) + Rrobin(w) + O(dist(z, w)).\nAs for the infinite kinetic energy, we conclude that it should be renormalized by replacing the diagonal terms G(wk, wk) by Rrobin(wk). This gives the same equations of motion as more direct approaches, or those available in the literature, like (Hally 1980; Boatto and Koiller 2015; Dritschel and Boatto 2015). Thus, the renormalized energy is\n(\u03bd, \u03bd)1,renorm = n\u2211\nk=1 2k Rrobin(wk) + \u2211 k = j k j G(wk, w j )\n+ g\u2211 j=1\n(\u222e\n\u03b1 j\n\u03b7\n\u222e\n\u03b2 j\n\u2217\u03b7 \u2212 \u222e\n\u03b1 j\n\u2217\u03b7 \u222e\n\u03b2 j\n\u03b7 ) . (5.16)\nThis depends on the locations w1, . . . , wn of the vortices (even the last term depends on these, although somewhat more indirectly).\nMany authors start out directly with the Robin function (5.15), but there are some advantages with exposing the two terms in it as individual quantities. One is that it clarifies the structure of the vortex motion equations by separating harmonic contributions, such as h0(wk) and G(wk, w j ), from differential geometric contributions, like log \u03bb(wk). The first category of terms can be classified as nonlocal, coming from solutions of elliptic partial differential equations on the entire surface, whereas the second category are purely local in nature. There is also the contribution from global circulations, represented by the final term in (5.16), and this may be considered to be truly global. So the vortex motion is in principle governed by a balance between different categories of contributions, local, nonlocal, and global in nature. As we shall see later, this balance is drastically changed in the more singular case of dipole motion (Sect. 8). Then, only the local terms survive.\nWe need to elaborate further the expression (5.1) and relate it to the global circulations. The 1-form \u03b7 is harmonic and hence can be expanded as\n\u03b7 = \u2212 g\u2211 j=1 A jdU\u03b2 j + g\u2211 j=1 BjdU\u03b1 j . (5.17)\nThe coefficients Ak , Bk are in view of (3.18), (3.19) given by\nAk = \u222e\n\u03b1k\n\u03b7, Bk = \u222e\n\u03b2k\n\u03b7.\nThe circulations of the total flow \u03bd = \u03b7 \u2212 \u2217dG\u03c9 then become\nak = \u222e\n\u03b1k\n\u03bd = Ak \u2212 \u222e\n\u03b1k\n\u2217dG\u03c9,\nbk = \u222e\n\u03b2k\n\u03bd = Bk \u2212 \u222e\n\u03b2k\n\u2217dG\u03c9.\nWe shall treat the circulations a1, . . . , ag, b1, . . . , bg as free (independent) variables, along with the locations w1, . . . , wn of the vortices. These variables will be the coordinates of the phase space, and together they determine \u03b7 and \u03bd. The locations of the vortices are given by complex variables, in contrast to the circulations which are real.\nIf\u03b3 is a closedoriented curve inM , fixed in timeand avoiding thepoint vortices, then according to the Euler equation (2.12), and in the notation used there, the circulation of \u03bd around \u03b3 changes with speed\nd\ndt\n\u222e\n\u03b3\n\u03bd = \u222e\n\u03b3\n\u2202\u03bd \u2202t =\n\u222e\n\u03b3\n(d\u03c6 \u2212 Lv\u03bd) = \u2212 \u222e\n\u03b3\ni(v)d\u03bd =\n= \u2212 \u222e\n\u03b3\ni(v)\u03c9 = \u222e\n\u03b3\ni(v) (\nV vol\n) =\nV\n\u222e\n\u03b3\n\u2217\u03bd.\nHere, we used also (2.6), (2.7), and (5.4). It follows, in particular, on choosing \u03b3 = \u03b1k, \u03b2k , that\ndak dt = V\n\u222e\n\u03b1k\n\u2217\u03bd = V\n\u222e\n\u03b1k \u2217\u03b7, (5.18) dbk dt = V \u222e\n\u03b2k\n\u2217\u03bd = V\n\u222e\n\u03b2k\n\u2217\u03b7.

Thus, for example, Rkj = \u222e \u03b2k \u2217dU\u03b1 j .\nNext, we write\ndU\u03b1 = \u239b \u239c\u239d dU\u03b11 ...\ndU\u03b1g\n\u239e \u239f\u23a0 , dU\u03b2 = \u239b \u239c\u239d dU\u03b21 ...\ndU\u03b2g\n\u239e \u239f\u23a0 .\nAs mentioned, these two column matrices together define a basis of the harmonic forms.

The relation between the bases is Lemma 5.1 The two bases {dU\u03b1, dU\u03b2} and {\u2217dU\u03b1, \u2217dU\u03b2} are related by\n( \u2217dU\u03b1 \u2217dU\u03b2 ) = ( RT Q \u2212P \u2212R ) ( dU\u03b1 dU\u03b2 ) .

The circulations a and b are fixed parameters, given in advance.\nHowever, the period vectors A and B still depend on time via w1 and w2. Indeed, using (3.20) and (3.21) we have\nA = a + 1 \u222e\n\u03b1\n( \u2217 dG(\u00b7, w1) \u2212 \u2217dG(\u00b7, w2) ) = a + 1 \u222b w1 w2 dU\u03b1,\nB = b + 1 \u222e\n\u03b2\n( \u2217 dG(\u00b7, w1) \u2212 \u2217dG(\u00b7, w2) ) = b + 1 \u222b w1 w2 dU\u03b2 j .\nThe Hamiltonian is given by\n2H(w1, w2) = ( 1, \u2212 1 ) ( Rrobin(w1) G(w1, w2) G(w2, w1) Rrobin(w2) )( 1 \u2212 1 )\n+ ( AT , BT ) (\nP R RT Q ) ( A B ) , (8.2)\nand the dynamics of the vortex pair {w1, w2} becomes, by (6.4),\n1\u03bb(w1) 2 w\u03071 = \u22122i \u2202H(w1, w2)\n\u2202w\u03041 ,\n1\u03bb(w2) 2 w\u03072 = +2i \u2202H(w1, w2)\n\u2202w\u03042 .\nIn place of w1 and w2, one may turn to w = 12 (w1 + w2) and u = 12 (w1 \u2212 w2) as coordinates. These are similar to the \u201ccenter-arrow coordinates\u201d used in Boatto and Koiller (2015), Smith and Nagem (2013). Then,\n{ w1 = w + u, w2 = w \u2212 u.

This limit then determines the orientation of the dipole.\nIn view of the symmetry H(w1, w2) = H(w2, w1), we have expansions\nH(w + u, w \u2212 u) = h0(w) + O(|u|2), h0(w \u00b1 u) = h0(w) \u00b1 ( h1(w)u + h1(w)u\n) + O(|u|2), log \u03bb(w \u00b1 u) = log \u03bb(w) \u00b1 1\n2\n( r(w)u + r(w)u) + O(|u|2)\n(coupled signs throughout). The latter equation uses the affine connection r(w) = rmetric(w), see (6.7) or (4.1). We record also\n\u03bb(w \u00b1 u)2 = \u03bb(w)2 ( 1 \u00b1 (r(w)u + r(w)u\u0304) + O(|u|2) ) . (8.4)\nUsing these expansions we obtain, for the first matrix in the Hamiltonian (8.2),\n2\u03c0 ( Rrobin(w1) G(w1, w2) G(w2, w1) Rrobin(w2) )\n= (\nh0(w + u) + log \u03bb(w + u) \u2212 log |2u| + H(w + u, w \u2212 u) \u2212 log |2u| + H(w + u, w \u2212 u) h0(w \u2212 u) + log \u03bb(w \u2212 u)\n)\n= (\nlog \u03bb(w) \u2212 log |2u| \u2212 log |2u| log \u03bb(w)\n) + ( h0(w) h0(w) h0(w) h0(w) )\n+ ( h1(w) + 12r(w) 0 0 \u2212h1(w) \u2212 12r(w) ) u + ( h1(w) + 12r(w) 0\n0 \u2212h1(w) \u2212 12r(w) ) u\u0304 + O(|u|2). (8.5)\nWhen acting with ( 1,\u2212 1) on both sides of the matrix (8.5), the last three terms in the final expression disappear and the result becomes, up to O(|u|2),\n( 1 \u2212 1 ) ( log \u03bb(w) \u2212 log |2u| \u2212 log |2u| log \u03bb(w) )( 1 \u2212 1 )\n= 2 21 ( log \u03bb(w) + log |2u|).

Therefore, the leading terms in this limit are given by\nH(w + u, w \u2212 u) = 2 1\n2\u03c0\n( log \u03bb(w) + log |2u|) + O(1) (u \u2192 0). (8.7)\nThis is essentially a constant factor times log of the distance (in the metric) between w1 = w + u and w2 = w \u2212 u. Indeed, we recover the simple and beautiful formula\nH(w1, w2) = 2 1\n2\u03c0 log dist (w1, w2) + O(1)\nof Boatto and Koiller. See equations (24) and (25) in Boatto and Koiller (2015). Compare also Ragazzo and Viglioni (2017). The distance is taken with respect to the Riemannian metric. The error term O(1) can be identified with a what is called the \u201cBatman function\u201d in Boatto and Koiller (2015).\nTo proceed toward the Hamilton equations (6.2), we differentiate the leading term in (8.7) and insert the metric affine connection r(w) = rmetric(w) as defined by (6.7),\ndH = \u2202H \u2202w dw + \u2202H \u2202w\u0304 dw\u0304 + \u2202H \u2202u du + \u2202H \u2202 u\u0304 du\u0304\n= 2 1\n4\u03c0\n( r(w)dw + r(w)dw\u0304 + du\nu + du\u0304 u\u0304\n) . (8.8)\nUsing (8.4), we expand the symplectic 2-form given by (8.1) in terms of w and u as\n= \u2212 1 2i\n( \u03bb(w + u)2d(w + u) \u2227 d(w\u0304 + u\u0304) \u2212 \u03bb(w \u2212 u)2d(w \u2212 u) \u2227 d(w\u0304 \u2212 u\u0304) )\n= i 1\u03bb(w)2 ( dw \u2227 du\u0304 \u2212 dw\u0304 \u2227 du + (r(w)u + r(w)u)(dw \u2227 dw\u0304 + du \u2227 du\u0304) )\n+O(|u|2).\nInterior derivation by\n\u03be = w\u0307 \u2202 \u2202w + \u02d9\u0304w \u2202 \u2202w\u0304 + u\u0307 \u2202 \u2202u + \u02d9\u0304u \u2202 \u2202 u\u0304\nthen gives, up to terms of order O(|u|2),\ni(\u03be) = i 1\u03bb(w)2 ( \u2212 ( \u02d9\u0304u+(r(w)u+r(w)u) \u02d9\u0304w)dw+(u\u0307+(r(w)u+r(w)u)w\u0307)dw\u0304\n\u2212 ( \u02d9\u0304w + (r(w)u + r(w)u) \u02d9\u0304u)du + (w\u0307 + (r(w)u + r(w)u)u\u0307)du\u0304 ) .\nComparing with (8.8), we see that the dynamics of the vortex pair is described by the two equations\n1 4\u03c0 i r(w) = \u03bb(w)2\n( u\u0307 + (r(w)u + r(w)u)w\u0307 ) , (8.9)\n1\n4\u03c0 i\n1 u\u0304 = \u03bb(w)2\n( w\u0307 + (r(w)u + r(w)u)u\u0307 ) , (8.10)\nvalid up to order O(|u|2) as u \u2192 0. Equation (8.10) is used to eliminate w\u0307 in (8.9), which then becomes\n1 4\u03c0 i r(w) = \u03bb(w)2u\u0307 + (r(w)u + r(w)u)\n( 1\n4\u03c0 iu\u0304 \u2212 \u03bb(w)2(r(w)u + r(w)u)u\u0307\n) ,\nagain up to O(|u|2). Here, the left member cancels with one of the terms in the right member, and the rest can be written, after division by u,\n0 = \u03bb(w)2 \u00b7 u\u0307 u + r(w) 1 4\u03c0 iu\u0304 \u2212 \u03bb(w)2(r(w)u + r(w)u)2 \u00b7 u\u0307 u ,\nnow up to an error of order O(|u|). In this equation, the final main term in the right member is of a smaller magnitude than the first two terms and is swallowed by the allowed general error O(|u|). Thus, we arrive at\n\u03bb(w)2 d\ndt log u + r(w) 1 4\u03c0 iu\u0304 = 0, (8.11)\nvalid with an error of at most O(|u|) as u \u2192 0. Equation (8.11) essentially comes from (8.9), and it is to be combined again with (8.10). For the latter, it is enough to use the simplified form\n1 4\u03c0 iu\u0304 = \u03bb(w)2 dw dt , (8.12)\nwhich only uses the leading terms, and for which the error is still at most O(|u|). Inserting (8.12) in (8.11) results in the master equation\nd dt log u + r(w)dw dt = 0. (8.13)\nOne problem with (8.13) is that the speed dw/dt becomes infinite, along with the first term, in the dipole limit. However, this problem only affects the real part of the equation. For the imaginary part, one can replace true time t by an arbitrary parameter, which may be scaled with u so that dw/dt remains finite as |u| \u2192 0. Alternatively one may scale 1 with u so that the left member of (8.12) remains finite. Then, one can still think of any new parameter t as a time variable. In any case, we take imaginary parts of (8.13) and obtain\nd dt arg u + Im(r(w)dw dt ) = 0. (8.14)\nEquation (8.12) shows that the directions of u and dw/dt are related as\narg u = arg dw dt \u00b1 \u03c0 2 , (8.15)\nwhere the plus sign is to be chosen if 1 > 0, the minus sign if 1 < 0. Now (8.14) and (8.15) taken together give the final law for the motion of the center w of the vortex pair in the dipole limit:\nd dt arg dw dt + Im(r(w)dw dt ) = 0. (8.16)\nAs explained in Sect. 4 (see specifically equation (4.3)), (8.18) is exactly the equation for a geodesic curve when expressed in an arbitrary parameter t . One may notice that (8.14) can be written in the parameter-free form\nd arg u + Im(r(w)dw) = 0\n(similarly for (8.16)), confirming the fact that the geometry of the dipole trajectory has a meaning independent of any choice of parameter.\nThe real part of (8.13) says, in view of (6.7), that\nd\ndt\n( log |u| + log \u03bb(w)) = 0,\nhence that |u|\u03bb(w) = C (constant) along each trajectory. By (8.12), this also gives \u2223\u2223\u2223dw dt \u2223\u2223\u2223 = C \u03bb(w) . (8.17)\nThus, along each trajectory \u03bb(w) is proportional to one over the velocity, and in this sense has the same role as the refraction index in optics.\nWe summarize the most essential parts of the above discussion as\nTheorem 8.1 The dynamical equations for a vortex pair in the dipole limit are identical with the geodesic equation for the metric ds = \u03bb(w)|dw|, namely\nd dt arg dw dt + Im\n( r(w) dw\ndt\n) = 0. (8.18)\nHere, w = w(t) is the location of the dipole, t is an arbitrarily scaled time parameter chosen such that dw/dt is finite.\nRemark 8.1 It is possible to understand why dipole move along geodesics by thinking of vortex pair as a \u201cwave front,\u201d in an optical analogy. Equation (8.15) says that the motion is perpendicular to the wave front (the line segment from w \u2212 u to w + u). Equation (8.14) then expresses that if the front of a vortex pair is not aligned with the level line of \u03bb(w) then the direction of u (representing the wave front) changes in such a way that the curve w(t) bends toward higher values of \u03bb.\nBeing slightly more direct and exact, on taking t to be Euclidean arc length the first term in (8.18) is the ordinary curvature for the curve traced out by w(t). The second term can be viewed as the inner product between the gradient of \u03bb(w) (this gradient can be identifiedwith r(w)) and dw/dt rotated 90 degrees to the right. Letting \u03b8 denote the angle between the gradient of \u03bb(w) and the velocity vector dw/dt , we can write\nIm ( r(w) dw\ndt\n) = |r(w)| \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 dw\ndt\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 sin \u03b8.\nThis is compatible with the laws of optics, for example Fermat\u2019s law, and also with \u201cSnell\u2019s law\u201d (see for example Guillemin and Sternberg 1984; Cawte et al. 2019) in the somewhat singular case that \u03bb(w) jumps between two constant values."

            "heading": "9 Remarks on VortexMotion in Planar Domains",
            "text": "Vortex motion in a planar domain can easily be treated as a special case of vortex motion on Riemann surfaces by turning to the Schottky double of the planar domain. For simplicity, we shall only discuss the case of one single vortex in the planar domain. The case of several vortices will be similar in an obvious way. The ideas in this section extend to cases of vortex motion on general open Riemannian surfaces with analytic boundary.\nLet \u2282 C be the planar domain, assumed to be bounded by finitely many real analytic curves. The Schottky double, first described in Schottky (1877), is the compact Riemann surface M = \u0302 obtained by completing with a \u201cbackside\u201d \u0303, having the opposite conformal structure, and gluing the two along the common boundary. Thus, \u0302 = \u222a\u2202 \u222a\u0303 in a set theoretic sense, and the conformal structure becomes smooth over \u2202 , as can be seen fromwell-known reflection principles. If z is a point in \u2282 M ,\nthen z\u0303 will denote the corresponding (reflected) point on \u0303 \u2282 M . Both z and z\u0303 can also be considered as points in C, then serving as coordinates of the mentioned points in M (holomorphic respectively anti-holomorphic coordinates), and as such they are the same: z = z\u0303 \u2208 C.\nIn our case, we also need a Riemannian structure, with a metric. This is to be the Euclideanmetric on each of and \u0303. But these do not fit smoothly across curved parts of \u2202 , the match will only be Lipschitz continuous. However, that is good enough for our purposes because the vortex will anyway never approach the boundary. (In the case of several vortices, it is, however, possible to make up situations in which vortices do reach the boundary.)\nThe metric on M = \u0302 is thus to be\nds = {\n|dz|, z \u2208 , |dz\u0303|, z\u0303 \u2208 \u0303. (9.1)\nTo see how this behaves across \u2202 , we need a holomorphic coordinate defined in a full neighborhood of this curve in M . A natural candidate can be defined in terms of the Schwarz function S(z) for \u2202 , a function which is defined by its properties of being holomorphic in a neighborhood of \u2202 in C and by satisfying\nS(z) = z\u0304 on \u2202 . (9.2)\nSee Davis (1974) and Shapiro (1992) for details about S(z). We remark that z \u2192 S(z) is the (local) anti-conformal reflection map in \u2202 and that S\u2032(z) = T (z)\u22122, where T (z) is the positively oriented and holomorphically extended unit tangent vector on \u2202 .\nThe complex coordinate z in extends, as a holomorphic function, to a full neighborhood of \u222a \u2202 , both when this neighborhood is considered as a subset of C and when it is considered as a subset of M . The first case is trivial, and the second case depends on \u2202 being analytic. In terms of the Schwarz function, this second extension is given by\nz = { z for z \u2208 \u222a \u2202 , S(z\u0303) for z\u0303 \u2208 \u0303, close to \u2202 . (9.3)\nIn the latter expression, S(z\u0303), z\u0303 is to be interpreted as a complex number. When the metric on M is expressed in the coordinate (9.3), it becomes\nds = {\n|dz| for z \u2208 \u222a \u2202 , |S\u2032(z)||dz| for z \u2208 C \\ , close to \u2202 . (9.4)\nIn the second case (with z \u2208 C \\ ), z = S(z\u0303), z\u0303 \u2208 \u0303, whereby z\u0303 = S(z) and so |dz\u0303| = |S\u2032(z)||dz|. Thus, (9.4) is consistent with (9.1). We see from the coordinate\nrepresentation (9.4) that the metric is only Lipschitz continuous across \u2202 . This is the best one can expect.\nThe associated affine connection (6.7) is in the coordinate (9.3) given by\nr(z) = { 0 for z \u2208 \u222a \u2202 , {S(z), z}1 for z \u2208 C \\ , close to \u2202 ,\nwhere\n{S(z), z}1 = S \u2032\u2032(z) S\u2032(z) = \u22122T \u2032(z) T (z) . (9.5)\nSee Sect. 4 for notations. Thus, r(z) is discontinuous across \u2202 and it is natural to represent it on this curve by its mean value:\nrMV(z) = 1 2 {S(z), z}1 = \u2212T \u2032(z) T (z) (z \u2208 \u2202 ). (9.6)\nExample 9.1 Let = D. Then, S(z) = 1/z and the coordinate z in (9.3) extends to the entire complex plane, thus representing all of M = D \u222a \u2202D \u222a D\u0303 except for the point 0\u0303 \u2208 D\u0303. The metric expressed in this coordinate becomes\nds = {\n|dz|, |z| \u2264 1, |z|\u22122|dz|, |z| > 1.\nThe affine connection similarly becomes\nr(z) = \u23a7\u23aa\u23a8 \u23aa\u23a9 0, |z| < 1, \u2212z, |z| = 1, \u22122z, |z| > 1.\nThe geodesic curves in are of course the (Euclidean) straight lines (similarly in \u0303), geodesic curves crossing \u2202 are straight lines reflecting into the other side under equal angles on \u2202 (just as ordinary optical reflection), while \u2202 is in itself a geodesic curve. The latter is intuitively obvious since at any point on \u2202 there should be one geodesic in the tangential direction, and this has no other way to go than to follow the boundary.\nTo confirm the last statement analytically, let t be an arc length (with respect to the Euclidean metric) parameter along \u2202 , so that T (z) = dzdt on \u2202 . The curvature \u03ba of \u2202 is\n\u03ba = d dt arg dz dt (z \u2208 \u2202 ),\nand using that T (z)T (z) = 1 on \u2202 one finds that\nT \u2032(z) = i\u03ba (z \u2208 \u2202 ).\nIn particular T \u2032(z), and so rMV(z)T (z) (by (9.6)), is purely imaginary on \u2202 . Combining with (9.6), it follows that\nd dt arg dz dt = irMV(z)T (z),\nhence\nd dt arg dz dt + Im(rMV(z)T (z) ) = 0 (z \u2208 \u2202 ).\nThus, the geodesic equation (8.18) holds for the curve \u2202 , as claimed. We remark that the curvature \u03ba of the boundary curve \u2202 appears also in the expression for the Gaussian curvature for the metric on M . That curvature vanishes on and on \u0303, whereas on \u2202 it has a singular contribution with density 2\u03ba with respect arc-length measure on \u2202 .\nA single vortex in a planar domain moves along a level line of the appropriate Robin function, or Routh\u2019s stream function Lin (1941a), Lin (1941b), Lin (1943)). If the vortex is near the boundary, then it follows the boundary closely, with high speed. From the perspective of the Schottky double, the boundary conditions for planar fluid motion are such that there is automatically a mirror vortex on the other side in the double; thus, we really have a vortex pair close to \u2202 on the double. In the limit, this becomes a vortex dipole, moving with infinite speed along the geodesic \u2202 .\nConsidering in somemore detail such a symmetric vortex pair, with vortex locations w \u2208 and w\u0303 \u2208 \u0303, we first notice that the Green function G\u03c9(z) for \u03c9 = \u03b4w \u2212 \u03b4w\u0303 simply is the antisymmetric extension to the Schottky double of the ordinary Green function G (z, w) for :\nG\u03b4w\u2212\u03b4w\u0303 (z) = G (z, w) (z \u2208 ).\nThen, the stream function \u03c8 in (5.2) becomes what is sometimes called the hydrodynamic Green function, which depends on the prescribed periods. This function, which can be traced back (at least in special cases) to Koebe (1916), Lin (1943), has more recently been discussed in for example Cohn (1980), Flucher and Gustafsson (1979), Flucher (1999), and Gustafsson and Sebbar (2012).\nWe wish to clarify how this hydrodynamic Green function is related to the modification, in the beginning of Sect. 5, of the general Green function flow \u2212 \u2217 dG\u03c9 by an additional term \u03b7. To do so we fix, in the case of a Schottky double M = \u0302, the homology basis in such a way that the curves \u03b2 j , j = 1, . . . ,g, closely follow the inner components of \u2202 , and each curve \u03b1 j goes from the j :th inner component of \u2202 through to the outer component, and then back again on the backside.\nWe also introduce the harmonic measures u j , j = 1, . . . ,g, here defined to be those harmonic functions in which takes the boundary value one on the designated\n(number j) inner component of \u2202 and vanishes on the rest of \u2202 . Their differentials du j extend harmonically to the Schottky double with \u222e \u03b1k du j = \u22122\u03b4k j , \u222e \u03b2k du j = 0. Thus, du j = \u22122dU\u03b2 j in terms of our general notations (as in (3.18) and (3.19)). In the block matrix notation of (5.21), we have\n\u2212 \u2217 dU\u03b2 = P dU\u03b1 + R dU\u03b2,\nwhere P = (Pkj ), R = (Rkj ) and (see (3.18), (3.19))\nPkj = \u2212 \u222e\n\u03b2 j\n\u2217dU\u03b2k , Rkj = \u222e\n\u03b1 j\n\u2217dU\u03b2k .\nThe last integral can be written\nRkj = \u22121 2\n\u222e\n\u03b1 j\n\u2217duk = \u22121 2\n\u222b\n\u03b1 j\u2229 \u2202uk \u2202n ds \u2212 1 2\n\u222b\n\u03b1 j\u2229\u0303 \u2202uk \u2202n ds,\nand it is easy to see that it is zero because of canceling contributions from and \u0303 due to the symmetry of duk and \u03b1 j going the opposite way on the backside.\nAs a general conclusion, we therefore have that R = 0 in the matrix (5.21) when M is the Schottky double of a planar domain. As a consequence,\n\u2212 \u2217 dU\u03b2 = P dU\u03b1.\nSimilarly, the other equation contained in (5.21) becomes\n\u2217 dU\u03b1 = Q dU\u03b2. (9.7)\nTurning now to the flow \u03b7 in (5.17), this is necessarily symmetric onM = \u0302, hence \u222e\n\u03b1 j\n\u03b7 = 0.\nIt follows that the coefficients A j in (5.17) vanish, whereby that equation becomes\n\u03b7 = g\u2211 j=1 BjdU\u03b1 j .\nIn terms of the stream function \u03c8 = G\u03c9 + \u03c80 (recall (5.2)) this gives, on inserting also (9.7),\nd\u03c80 = \u2217\u03b7 = g\u2211 j=1 Bj \u2217 dU\u03b1 j = g\u2211 j=1 C jdU\u03b2 j = d ( \u2212 1 2 g\u2211 j=1 C ju j ) ,\nwith C j = \u2211gi=1 Bi Qi j . It follows in particular that \u03c80, and hence all of \u03c8 , is singlevalued on .\nIn summary, the total stream function is\n\u03c8(z) = G (z, w) + g\u2211 j=1 C jU\u03b2 j (z),\nand it is single-valued when restricted to . It is clear that the C j will actually depend on w, and for symmetry reasons the above formula eventually takes the well-known form\n\u03c8(z) = G (z, w) + g\u2211\ni, j=1 Ci jU\u03b2i (z)U\u03b2 j (w)\nfor some constants Ci j subject to Ci j = C ji .
