Production of multiple emulsions is one of the main goals of manufacturing microfluidic devices. Design and fabrication of microfluidics are functions of the size of emulsion droplets, properties of fluids applied for emulsification, and considered stability for emulsions. In this article, we have manufactured a novel microfluidic device using simple fabrication and accessible materials. Capillary tubes, PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) chassis, a medical needle of gauge 32, and O-rings are the primary materials used to produce this device. The production procedure is explained completely, and all the drawings are represented. Concerning probable interactions between glues and flowing fluids, we tried to fabricate and seal the device without applying chemical agents. The device is tested by n-heptane and deionized water to produce multiple water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) emulsions. A sensitivity analysis on the rate of injection is performed. Considering the HLB (hydrophilic\u2013lipophilic balance) as an important property of emulsifiers, the effects of two different types of emulsifiers (sodium dodecyl sulfate with HLB of 40 and glycerol monostearate with HLB of 3.8) at various concentrations are investigated. Due to the results, the injection rate of the mediate phase should be less than half of the outer phase for the formation of emulsions. Consequently, the rate of injection for the inner phase should be less than half of that for the mediate phase. The simplicity of production and accessible raw materials could be considered as the strengths of our microfluidic device.

            "text": "I. INTRODUCTION\nMultiple emulsions have extensive applications in the food industry, drug delivery, and lubricants.1 The existence of a shell in multiple emulsions enables these fluids to protect the core material at various conditions. A shell phase surrounds the core material, and the shell phase is emulsified in a carrier phase.2 Multiple emulsions could be oil in water in oil (O/W/O) or water in oil in water (W/O/W). Indeed, in multiple emulsions, a water phase is located between two oily phases or vice versa. Multiple emulsions are common systems for encapsulating variable materials, which should be applied to a specific environment, condition, or organ.3\nAlthough some useful food ingredients are necessary for the body, they have an inappropriate smell and taste. Flavoring and\nchanging the taste of foods is one of the applications of multiple emulsions.4\nEach drug has a particular goal and should be delivered to a specific organ, while the drug could be adsorbed to the other organs during digestion. To avoid this phenomenon, the drug materials should be capsulated and covered by different shell materials. In fact, the drugs are protected by shell material to secure their delivery to the goal organ of the body.5 Designing the core\u2013shell system should be performed concerning the conditions at the goal organ and other organs. The shell should be resistant to the situation of other organs, and it should be degraded by unique conditions at the goal organ. Multiple emulsions are assumed to be efficient solutions for drug delivery.6\nIn addition, with respect to existence of harsh conditions in oil reservoirs multiple emulsions and encapsulated materials could\nRev.

Appropriate emulsifiers, proper shear stress, and emulsification method are determinative factors in the formation of emulsions.9 The application of microfluidic devices to produce multiple emulsions has recently been noticed.10 Designing the microfluidic devices is performed by various methods and with respect to the goals of projects. Several criteria, such as accuracy of machining, assembling, sealing, and closed tolerance, should be considered through designing and manufacturing microfluidic devices.11 In addition, preventing the probable interactions between materials of microfluidic devices and phases used for emulsification is essential.12\nThe formation of emulsion in a microfluidic device is a function of various parameters, same as the injection rate of each phase, the radius of tubes used in the device, and the rheological properties of fluids. Utada et al. (2005) introduced jet flow and dripping as the flowing regimes of microfluidic devices. The following equations can be used to predict the flowing regime of a capillary device:13\ntg = R3jet/Qsum, (1)\ntpinch = CRjet\u03b7OF/\u03b3. (2)\nIf tg < tpinch, the flowing regime will be jet. Otherwise, the dripping regime is expected for the device under certain conditions.\nConfiguration and manufacturing of microfluidic devices have been the subject of some research in the past decade. These devices mainly consist of three main paths or tubes for the flowing carrier phase, shell phase, and core fluid.14 Although the mechanism of emulsification through microfluidic devices is similar in all types of manufactured devices, the devices differ in the type of assembling, sort, and dimension of the tubes and the method of production.\nBandulasena et al. (2019) designed a microfluidic device to generate multiple emulsions. Round capillary glasses were considered as the tubes of microfluidic devices. They manufactured three blocks as locations of tubes by polyacetal for coupling the tubes into them. The polyacetal blocks can be attached to each other by LEGO-type connections. The device is tested with deionized water as the water phase and mineral oil as the oil phase. The successful formation of W/O/W multiple emulsions is reported.15\nUsing 3D-printed patterns for manufacturing microfluidic devices is common.16 Martino et al., in 2014, introduced their microfluidic device, which was printed using a 3D printer. To test the device, they used deionized water as the inner and outer fluids and mineral oil as the middle phase. The device worked properly during the test process. Due to the enclosed tolerance of 3D printers, these devices are highly accurate.17 However, the raw materials used for 3D printers are mainly soluble in some inorganic fluids (e.g., benzene, n-hexane, and toluene). In addition, their surface quality is not high enough for accurate visual observations.\nLi et al. (2013) manufactured a microfluidic device by using resin epoxy, a capillary tube, and microscope slides. Lower cost, simple fabrication, and the ability to observe under the microscope are the positive points of their device. Difficult cleaning and the application of high-tech tools for drilling the glass could be considered weak points. Their device successfully passed the tests of production of multiple emulsions.18\nFIG. 1. Front view of the manufactured microfluidic device.\nSome microfluidics work by T-junction structures. The wettability of the surface of channels plays a key role in these types of microfluidics.19 First, the desired pattern is carved on a plastic sticker using a laser instrument. Thereafter, the sticker is pasted on a clean glass, and by using diluted HF (hydrofluoric) acid, the dissolution of the glass takes place. There is no interaction between HF acid and plastic, while it can dissolve glass at a limited level. Finally, the sticker is removed, and another glass plate is etched on the surface of the main glass by the thermal etching process. Inexpensive fabrication and high accuracy in carving the pattern are known as the main positive points of these devices. Cleaning and washing are the main challenges of T-junction microfluidics. In addition, the uncontrolled rate of dissolution is another limitation of manufacturing microfluidic devices with this method. The uncontrolled rate of dissolution results in uncertainty in the diameter of flowing paths.\nThe direction of flowing phases is also an important criterion in designing microfluidic devices. All phases could flow co-currently and in the same direction. On the contrary, at least two of them could flow in opposite directions (countercurrently). It should be noted that, finally, all fluids will be moved in the same direction in the outlet of the device. The direction of movement can affect the force that is exerted on each fluid.20\nOvercoming the severities, limitations, and challenges against the production of previous devices, a microfluidic device is designed and manufactured in this research. The mediate and outer fluids flow countercurrently. The availability of materials, simple fabrication (without using chemical agents), and preventing probable interactions between fluids and device materials are considered the main criteria for design. The exerted shear stress and shear rate to fluids in each tube are calculated. Figure 1 represents the manufactured microfluidic device."

The fluids will flow countercurrently through this tube. In addition, both injection and collection capillary tubes are located at the center of the main tube. The flowing fluids should meet each other at the inlet of the collection tube. In other words, the head of the main tube is the inlet for the carrier\nRev. Sci.

This tube should be aligned in the center of the main tubes. The core fluid will be pumped to the device from the inlet of this tube. The outlet of the injection tube faces the inlet of the collection tube at the center of the main tube.\nMultiple emulsions (capsules) will be formed at the inlet of the collection tube. The collection tube is the path for leaking them out. In other words, the emulsification or encapsulation will take place at the inlet collection tube. The core phase will be surrounded by the shell phase with the help of shear stress at the inlet of the collection tube. The collection tube and the injection tube should be aligned symmetrically and longitudinally at the center of the main tube.\nThe visibility of the emulsification procedure and flow stream introduced glass capillary tubes as a suitable candidate for flowing paths. The sizes of the selected tubes are summarized in Table I. To apply more shear stress on the core phase and sequentially have better control of this fluid, the outlet of the injection tube should be tighter than the inlet of the collection tube. In addition, the size of the injection tube nozzle has a direct effect on the size of core droplets. Since the aim of manufacturing this microfluidic device is to generate micro-multiple emulsions, the inner diameter of the injection and collection tubes should be in the micron range. To obtain a nozzle-like edge and conical form at the outlet of the injection tube and raise the pressure, a tube with 100 \u03bcm inner diameter was heated above a flame symmetrically and pulled out mechanically (as tight as possible). Based on the design criteria, the outlet diameter of the injection tube should be lower than 100 \u03bcm. As pulling the tube above the flame did not have enough accuracy to create a homogeneous conic, a medical needle with gauge 32 was coupled at the outlet of the injection tube (at the conical head). The dimensions and properties of the needle gauge 32 are summarized in Table II.\nObviously, the internal diameter of the main tube should be greater than the outer diameters of the injection and collection tubes. The differences between the internal diameter of the main tube and the outer diameters of the injection and collection tubes should not be as high to let injection and collection move freely in the vertical\nIdentification\n(mm)\n(mm)\n(mm) Material\nNeedle gauge 32 0.108 0.235 0.064 Stainless steel (316)\ndirection. The greater the gap between the inner diameter of the main tube and the outer diameters of the collection and injection tubes, the more the gravity force will affect the flow. Fixing the position of tubes is of high importance. Centralizing and alignment of the injection tube and collection tube have great effects on the emulsification process.13 To exert extra pressure on the drops injected from the outlet of the injection tube, the inner diameter at the inlet of the collection tube should be lower than the body of the tube. In other words, an orifice should be created at the inlet of the collection tube. This pressure prevents the continuous flow of each phase. Therefore, the inlet of the collection tube was heated symmetrically for some seconds on the direct flame. Figure 2 schematically represents the arrangement of the tubes."

The injection and collection tubes should be fixed to their unique chassis (bolts), while the main tube will be held by two chassis (nuts). To avoid probable interactions of flowing fluids and coupling materials, such as glue and paste, chemical agents are not recommended for assembling the device. The tip of the injection and collection tubes is kept by two bolts, and the bolts will be tightened onto their nuts. The nuts are the chassis for coupling the main tube. Figure 3 represents the 3D schematic of the designed chassis. Two sets of bolts and nuts should be manufactured. The selected material for chassis (bolts and nuts) is PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene). Due to the activity of chemical agents that might be used in this system, PTFE is selected to avoid interactions with normal chemical (non-acidic) agents. Thermal expansion and contraction of PTFE, on the one hand, and its elasticity, on the other hand, were additional reasons for this selection. As another positive point, machining operation on PTFE is easier than for other materials.\nFigure 4 illustrates the drawings of nuts and their dimensional details.

The flow of fluids into the injection, collection, and main tubes has been investigated by three syringe pumps simultaneously. The wetting properties of tubes may have key roles in the emulsification process. Before entering the collection tube, the mediate fluid flows through the annulus between the outer surface of the injection tube and the inner surface of the main tube, while the channel between the outer surface of the collection tube and the inner surface of the main tube belongs to the carrier fluid (outer phase). It is obvious that the wetting properties of the surfaces should be in confirmation with the connecting fluid. The state of wettability of the inner surface of the collection tube should be the same as the outer phase. If we need to produce W/O/W, the wettability of this region should be water-wet. As we know, the natural wettability for glass surfaces is water-wet.\nTo evaluate the performance of the device, a series of experiments were designed. Sensitivity analyses on flow rate and type of emulsifier have been performed during this stage. The generation of W/O/W emulsions was the final goal of the experiment design. Deionized water (DIW) and N-heptane were used as water and oil phases, respectively. Due to the clarity of DIW and N-heptane, a very low amount of dye oil-based color (Sudan red) was added to\nN-heptane to distinguish the oil phase. The fluids entered the system using three syringe pumps. Obtaining the appropriate injection rate, the flow rate of each phase was varied, and with respect to the observations, the fair flow rates were specified. Generally, the flow rate of the outer phase should be greater than the mediate phase, and consequently, the inner phase should have the lowest flow rate. This rule was obeyed during our experiments.\nSince the oil phase is placed in the middle of two water phases, the dispersion of emulsifiers in both the oil and water phases is of importance. So, the HLB (Hydrophilic\u2013Lipophilic Balance) of emulsifiers should be considered in the experiments. The greater value of the HLB index indicates more hydrophilicity. In contrast, emulsifiers with an HLB index between 1 and 4 are known as hydrophobic. We tested SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) with an HLB of 40 as a hydrophilic emulsifier and glycerol monostearate with an HLB of 3.8 as the hydrophobic one. If the emulsifier is dispersed in the oil phase homogeneously, a suitable generation of multiple emulsions will be expected."

            "text": "as the gradient of velocity perpendicular to the flow direction. The shear rate of Newtonian fluids could be calculated by the following equation:\n\u03b3\u0307 = v h , (4)\nwhere v is the velocity of fluid flow, h is the distance at the perpendicular axis, and \u03b3\u0307 represents the shear rate in Eq. (4). As can be seen, the value of the shear rate can be increased by increasing the velocity or reducing the diameter of the pipe. Therefore, the shear rate is not an intrinsic property of the fluid, and it only depends on the condition of flow. Table V represents the shear rate and shear stress in each experiment.\nThe injection rate and the diameter of tubes are two important parameters in the final state of formed emulsions. Shear rate and shear stress are directly in contact with both of these parameters. Thus, the shear rate and shear stress are effective in the formation of multiple emulsions. Indeed, the shear rate and shear stress have key roles in emulsification at the collection tube. It is obvious that reducing the size of emulsions is highly dependent on the injection rate and, consequently, a function of shear rate and shear stress. Varying the injection rate can help us to have O/W emulsions with medium-sized oil phase droplets. Achievement of the smaller size of emulsions and multiple emulsions is impossible without the application of emulsifiers. Since the emulsification process takes place in the collection tube, the values of shear rate and shear stress in this tube are of importance. The minimum shear rate exerted on the oil phase and outer water phase for obtaining O/W emulsions with mediumsize droplets is 8149 and 16 298 s\u22121, respectively. The size of oil phase droplets could be reduced by the addition of emulsifiers. However, the shear rate exerted on the inner water phase at the collection tube should be at least 4074.5 s\u22121 for the formation of W/O/W multiple emulsions in the presence of an appropriate amount of emulsifiers.\nNot only the aforementioned parameters affect the emulsification procedure, but also other parameters such as alignment and\ncentralizing of capillary tubes, wettability of surface of flowing paths, and viscosity of each phase can influence the process significantly."

            "text": "With respect to available equipment and materials, a microfluidic device is designed and manufactured. The device has been tested to find out its efficiency in the production of multiple emulsions. Fabrication and sealing without glues or pastes extended its applications to be used in many fluids. During the experimental procedure, it was clarified that the emulsifiers with lower HLB are proper for the generation of W/O/W multiple emulsions. In fact, the emulsifiers with lower HLB can produce W/O/W with a lower concentration in comparison with high HLB emulsifiers. Spreading this emulsifier in the oil phase, on the one hand, and the presence of the oil phase between two water phases, on the other hand, enhance the efficiency of emulsifiers with lower HLB values.\nIn addition, the effects of injection rate were also investigated. It was observed that varying the rate of injection can reduce the size of O/W emulsions up to a specified value. A further reduction in the size of droplets and the generation of W/O/W multiple emulsions take place in the presence of emulsifiers. Shear rate and shear stress are introduced as important parameters with determinative roles. For the investigated system (DIW, n-heptane, and DIW) and in the presence of an appropriate amount of emulsifiers, the multiple emulsions will be formed at shear stress equal to 145.05, 31.69, and 36.26 Pa for inner, mediate, and outer phases, respectively. Therefore, we have to tune the injection rate to achieve shear stress above the mentioned values."
