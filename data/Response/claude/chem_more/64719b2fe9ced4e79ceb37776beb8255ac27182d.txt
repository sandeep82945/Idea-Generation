 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct in vivo studies in animal models of bladder cancer to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combining ITCs with cisplatin and gemcitabine. This would provide important preclinical data before testing in humans.

2. Investigate the molecular mechanisms of ITC-induced apoptosis in cisplatin/gemcitabine resistant bladder cancer cells. Understanding these mechanisms could reveal new therapeutic targets. 

3. Evaluate synergistic combinations of different ITCs to determine if certain ratios/doses have enhanced anti-tumor effects compared to individual ITCs. This could optimize the therapeutic potential.

4. Explore the effects of ITCs on invasion and metastasis of drug-resistant bladder cancer cells. The paper suggests ITCs may impact these processes but more research is needed. 

5. Initiate clinical trials in bladder cancer patients to evaluate adding ITC supplements to standard chemotherapy. This would provide key data on efficacy, safety, and tolerability in humans. Phase 1 trials could first determine optimal dosing.
