Information on self-harm, support(s) accessed\nafter self-harm, and satisfaction with support received were obtained via a structured,\nself-report questionnaire. No tests for significance were conducted.\nResults: 1,457 (12.5%) students reported having ever self-harmed and 789 (6.7%)\nreported self-harming during the first national lockdown. Informal sources of support\nwere accessed by the greatest proportion of respondents (friends: 35.9%; parents:\n25.0%). Formal sources of support were accessed by considerably fewer respondents\n(Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services: 12.1%; psychologist/ psychiatrist: 10.2%;\ngeneral practitioner: 7.4%). Online support was accessed by 8.6% of respondents,\nand 38.3% reported accessing no support at all.

Of\nthe respondents who sought no support, 11.3% reported this as being helpful.\nGeulayov et al. Adolescent Self-Harm and Help-Seeking\nConclusions: More than a third of secondary school students in this sample did not\nseek any help following self-harm. The majority of those not seeking help did not find\nthis to be a helpful way of coping. Further work needs to determine effective ways of\novercoming barriers to help-seeking among adolescents who self-harm and improving\nperceived helpfulness of the supports accessed.\nKeywords: Self-harm, adolescence, school, help-seeking, mental health, self-poisoning, self-injury"

            "text": "Since the onset of the global pandemic there have been concerns about its impact on adolescent self-harm. Self-harm is defined as any act of intentional self-poisoning or self-injury, irrespective of motivation (1, 2). Evidence, however, suggests that presentations to hospital emergency departments due to self-harm in adolescents have decreased, including in England (3\u20135). Any reported change may reflect a proportionate change in the incidence of self-harm in the community. However, little is known about the incidence and prevalence of selfharm in the community in England since the onset of the pandemic. Furthermore, for those who have not presented to health services following self-harm during this period, little is known about the type(s) of support, if any, they have received.\nAdolescent self-harm is a major public health problem (6) that is associated with numerous adverse health and social\noutcomes (7\u20139), including depression, substance misuse, poorer educational attainment, and dying by suicide (10). It has been suggested that in the years leading up to the pandemic, in England, the incidence of self-harm in adolescents has been increasing (11, 12). Self-harm can have a profound impact on the adolescents themselves, as well as their families and friends, health services, and the wider community (13, 14). Despite this, prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately half of school-aged adolescents did not seek any support following an incident of self-harm (15), and only 1- in-8 presented to health services for medical treatment (16). Common reasons for this included the stigma and self-stigma associated with self-harm (17, 18), and a lack of knowledge about where to seek help (15). For those who do seek help, the previously published literature indicates that friends and family members are the most commonly reported sources of support (15). Help-seeking following self-harm is important because it represents an opportunity to offer individuals help and support which may mitigate the harmful impact of selfharm, irrespective of the motivation or intention associated with the behavior.\nIn this study, using data from a large sample of secondary school students in England surveyed after the onset of the pandemic, we aimed to (1) identify the prevalence of help-seeking among those with a history of self-harm; (2) examine the degree to which they perceived the support accessed as being helpful; and (3) identify the barriers to help-seeking behavior in students who did not access any support."

Self-poisoning included the intentional ingestion of any drug where the amount exceeds that prescribed or the ingestion of non-ingestible substances, overdoses of \u201crecreational drugs,\u201d and severe alcohol intoxication where the individual intended to harm themselves. Self-injury was defined as any injury that was intentionally selfinflicted. Detailed questions relating to self-harm were based on those used in the Child and Adolescent Self-harm in Europe (CASE) study (22).\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 2 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 881248\nGeulayov et al. Adolescent Self-Harm and Help-Seeking\nFIGURE 1 | Sample selection process.\nLifetime self-harm was defined as intentional self-poisoning or self-injury which had occurred at any point prior to the survey. We used two questions to ascertain lifetime self-harm (Supplementary Table 1). For respondents who endorsed item 1 (\u201cEver self-harmed\u201d) their free-text item (item 8) describing their act of self-harm was reviewed by two researchers (GG and ES) independently. They were classified with \u201clifetime self-harm\u201d if their described act (item 8) met the study criteria (23). Past year self-harm was defined as intentional self-poisoning or self-injury which occurred in the 12 months prior to survey administration. Respondents who endorsed item 1 (\u201cEver self-harmed)\u201d, had selfharmed within the past year (items 4, \u201cLast self-injury\u201d and/or 7, \u201cLast self-poisoned\u201d), and who described a valid method of self-harm (item 8) were considered to have self-harmed in the past year. Self-harm in the past 6 months was defined as above, but had self-harmed within the past 6 months. Self-harm during lockdown was defined as intentional self-poisoning or self-injury which occurred between 23March 2020 (i.e., the beginning of the first UK lockdown) and the date of survey administration (JuneJuly 2020). Respondents who endorsed item 1 \u201cEver self-harmed\u201d and item 2 \u201cEver self-injured\u201d (from \u201cOnce or twice\u2019 to \u201cDaily\u201d) and item 3 \u201cSelf-injured during lockdown\u201d (from \u201cOnce or twice\u201d to \u201cMost days\u201d), or if they endorsed items 1 and 5 \u201cEver selfpoisoned\u201d (\u201cYes\u201d) and 6 \u201cSelf-poisoned during lockdown\u201d (\u201cYes\u201d) were classified as having self-harmed during lockdown (provided their described act[s] of self-harm met the study criteria). All others were considered not to have self-harmed during lockdown (Supplementary Table 1). Our method of self-harm ascertainment was contingent on the provision of information about the method of self-harm, in the form of free text. Some respondents who endorsed the item about self-harm did not provide further information on their act or provided information which was inconsistent with the study criteria (n = 999). The vast majority of those (n = 887, 88.8%) did not provide a free text response, 57 (5.7%) stated that they did not wish to provide further information, 18 (1.8%) described\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 3 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 881248\nGeulayov et al. Adolescent Self-Harm and Help-Seeking\nthe reason or motivation for their act rather than their act, 7 (0.7%) denied self-harming, 4 (0.4%) described an act which was not consistent with self-harm (examples cannot be provided due to small numbers), 3 (0.3%) described the location and time of their self-harm, while the remaining 23 (2.3%) provided a range of other text options (e.g., a symbol).\nRespondents who reported having self-harmed were asked whether or not they received support following self-harm from any of the following: Parent, step-parent, or carer; Brother or sister; Someone else in their family; Friends; GP (family doctor); Social Worker; School or college nurse/welfare staff; Psychologist or psychiatrist; Telephone helpline; Dropin/advice center; Residential Warden; CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services); Website or online forum; or No-one, and the extent to which the support sought was perceived as helpful (response categories: Not helpful at all; Not helpful enough; Just about helpful enough; Quite helpful; Very helpful). Information about the reasons for not receiving support was sought from respondents who approached noone for support. Respondents could select one or more of the following: Did not trust anyone; Did not want help; Didn\u2019t want to burden anyone else; Didn\u2019t want the stigma; Didn\u2019t know where to get help; Worried about it not being kept confidential; Scared/worried about what people might say; Other. Respondents who reported having self-harmed were further asked whether they required subsequent medical attention (i.e., whether or not they needed medical care therefore including only those who perceived a need for medical treatment), and the source of care they sought, including: Own first aid; Familyprovided first aid; School nurse/first aid at school/college; Friends helped; GP (family doctor); Ambulance/paramedics; Hospital A&E / acute mental health provision; Hospital with overnight stay on ward; Other. Respondents were permitted to select multiple sources."

We calculated post-stratification weights to reduce possible non-response bias using raking and auxiliary information for a subset of demographics that could be matched with the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) Census data for the participating counties. Weights were derived using regional census data including information on 1) type of school (independent vs. other i.e., state primary/secondary); 2) gender (male/female); 3) English as first language (we used a proxy of child and both parents born in UK); 4) age; and 5) Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD; based on school address). The IMD is an official measure of deprivation of small geographical areas in England. It is a combined score from the following domains: income and employment, health and disability, education, skills and training, barriers to housing and services, living environment and crime. There are 32,844 small geographical areas across England which are ranked from 1 (most deprived) to 32,844 (least deprived). All analyses were conducted using Stata 14.2 (27)."

Of those who did not access support, one in nine (11.3%) reported this as helpful. Respondents who reported not accessing any support were more likely to have parents born outside the UK, more likely to attend male-only schools, and less likely to be eligible to receive free school meals (Supplementary Table 2).\nWe compared the patterns of supports accessed by adolescents who self\u2013harmed during lockdown to supports accessed prior to the pandemic. Of the adolescents who reported self\u2013harming during lockdown (n = 789, 6.7% of adolescents surveyed), most reported accessing informal sources of support [friends: 36.5% (95% CI 33.1\u201340.0); parents or carers: 23.6% (95% CI 20.7\u201326.7); sibling: 7.0% (95% CI 5.3\u20139.1)]. Smaller numbers accessed clinical services [(CAMHS: 14.5% (95% CI 12.2\u201317.1); psychologist or psychiatrist: 11.1% (95% CI 9.1\u201313.5); GP: 8.2% (95% CI 6.5\u201310.2)]. Just 10.2% (95% CI 8.2\u201312.5) accessed support through a website or online forum and 5.6% (95% CI 4.2\u20137.4) received support from a telephone helpline. 38.2% (95% CI 34.7\u201341.8) accessed no support. The overall pattern was similar in adolescents who self\u2013harmed prior to the pandemic (n = 668, 5.8% of adolescents surveyed) with most accessing informal sources [friends: 35.1% (95% CI 31.5\u201338.9), parents or carers: 26.6% (95% CI 23.3\u201330.2) and sibling: 8.1% (95% CI 6.2\u2013 10.5)]. The number of adolescents accessing all other types of support was markedly smaller [(CAMHS: 9.2% (95% CI 7.2\u2013 11.8); psychologist or psychiatrist: 9.1% (95% CI 7.2\u201311.6); GP: 6.6% (95% CI 4.9\u20138.7)]. 6.8% (95% CI 5.1\u20139.1) accessed support through a website or online forum and 2.1% (95% CI 1.3\u20133.5) received support from a telephone helpline while 38.4% (95% CI 34.6\u201342.3) accessed no support. Nevertheless, the proportion of adolescents who received support through CAMHS was comparatively lower in adolescents who self\u2013harmed before the pandemic [9.2% (95% CI 7.2\u201311.8)] relative to those who reported self\u2013harm since its onset [14.5% (95% CI 12.2\u201317.1)]. Similarly, the proportion of adolescents who accessed support through a website or online forum was somewhat lower in the\npre\u2013pandemic [6.8% (95% CI 5.1\u20139.1)] than since its onset 10.2% (95% CI 8.2\u201312.5)]."

We observed marked differences in the reported utilization of various sources of support and the degree to which these were perceived as helpful. Accessing informal sources of support and not accessing any support were the most frequent responses. Although no formal tests for significance were conducted, many of the confidence intervals overlapped heavily and, on this basis, there appeared to be no gender differences in any categories."

In the context of the national COVID\u221219 lockdown that coincided with our data collection period, informal sources of support may have been more readily accessible than clinical or school\u2013based support services. However, this pattern was seen whether adolescents self\u2013harmed prior to or since the onset of the pandemic. Furthermore, a 2014 systematic review of adolescent help\u2013seeking behavior following self\u2013harm (15) also reported that young people primarily turn to friends and family members for support following an act of self\u2013 harm, suggesting that COVID\u221219 may not have been a unique contributing factor to this finding."

Furthermore, clinical services were perceived to be less helpful than informal sources of support such as friends and family members. During the first UK lockdown, there was a significant reduction in the number of referrals to mental health services, including to CAMHS (28). This was driven partly by a reduced healthcare workforce due to sickness and self\u2013isolation, and by substantial changes in service configuration and accessibility which are likely to have influenced our findings. The low prevalence of help\u2013 seeking observed in our study supports previous research in this area prior to the onset of the COVID\u221219 pandemic (16)."

These sources were also rated as the least helpful of all available sources of support, with just over a third reporting that they found these services helpful. Our finding that adolescents did not access support from readily available, anonymous, cost\u2013neutral sources\u2014even in the relative absence of more formal support options due to the COVID\u221219 lockdown\u2014requires further investigation. Many clinical services, along with the wider public health and research agenda, have placed considerable emphasis on developing virtual resources to support mental health (29, 30). Yet, despite being forced to spend more time in the virtual environment due to education shifting online for most students, our findings suggest that young people have not turned to such resources in times of acute distress. This may reflect a lack of awareness of these resources, or the belief theymay not be helpful (or both) and highlight the importance of ensuring that if online resources are developed, they are informed by the young people themselves. Such work may be of benefit in two ways here: first, it may help us understand how to make information about available support(s) more accessible to the relevant users (e.g., via social media platforms). Second, if young people are aware of existing sources of support but perceive them to be unhelpful, further work may identify alternative approaches they might find potentially helpful."

            "heading": "No Support Accessed",
            "text": "Approximately two in five respondents who reported a history of self\u2013harm did not access any sources of support. The most common reasons cited for not accessing support were 1) not wanting help; 2) not wanting to burden anybody; and 3) being scared or worried about what others might say. Other reasons included not trusting anyone and not knowing where to access support, both of which were endorsed by a higher proportion of females than males. Importantly, more than half of this group reported that not accessing any support following self\u2013harm was unhelpful and only one in nine stated that it was helpful. Furthermore, many of the reasons most frequently endorsed by the respondents for not seeking help (e.g., stigma, feeling burdensome, and others\u2019 opinions) are related to shame and fear. This suggests that some young people who self\u2013harm would welcome either formal or informal support to better manage their self\u2013harm and/or the distress associated with it, yet, paradoxically, they are not accessing such support. In light of this unmet need, more work is required to understand the reasons why the young people did not seek help.\nOur finding that 38% of respondents did not access any support following self\u2013harm expands on previous review findings (15), which noted that up to one half of adolescents who self\u2013 harm do not seek help afterwards. They also support previous UK\u2013based research indicating that most self\u2013harm among young adolescents does not come to the attention of clinical services (6), and the common reasons provided for not accessing help following self\u2013harm (15, 31, 32). More work could be carried out within schools and other relevant settings to address barriers such as concerns about privacy, availability of support and stigma surrounding mental health difficulties. Further work is also needed to better understand the response of 60% of adolescents who did not receive support because they did not want help, and\nthe extent to which they did not access any support because they perceived the support available to be unhelpful.\nMedical Intervention Following Self\u2013Harm All respondents who reported self\u2013harm were asked if they required medical treatment after their most recent episode of self\u2013harm. Of these, less than one in twenty reported accessing help from an ambulance, GP, or hospital emergency department. Rather, most applied their own first aid or received assistance from friends or family members. A larger proportion of females than males reported applying their own first aid and receiving help from a family member. Adolescent self\u2013harm may signal the occurrence of other risk behaviors posing additional hazards for young people (7), including increased risk of premature death (14, 33). Although self\u2013harm varies substantially in terms of medical severity, it is concerning that most young people who thought they needed medical intervention did not seek appropriate help. There are likely to be high levels of untreated morbidity and distress among this population and facilitating the help\u2013seeking of this difficult\u2013to\u2013reach group of young people should be considered an urgent priority. Alongside wider, population\u2013based strategies to reduce mental health\u2013related stigma (34), young people may benefit from decisional support aids addressing a variety of psychosocial and physical needs (35). Our findings suggest that parents and friends need more effective methods to help those who have self\u2013harmed and to facilitate help\u2013seeking where appropriate, and services and policymakers need to ensure that these supports are acceptable and accessible to adolescents in a timely manner. Ideally, all young people should have access to evidence\u2013based guidance to help them manage their own self\u2013harm (if applicable), and/or to offer support to their friends who may be engaging in self\u2013harm. Similarly, it is important to determine which resources would be most helpful for parent and carers as well as school staff.\nConsideration must also be given to the optimal social scaffolding that will support students\u2019 ongoing emotional development andminimize the risk of self\u2013harm, and to promote protective and enabling relationships with families, schools, communities, and peers (36).\nFurthermore, schools may be an important setting to address self\u2013harm. There is some evidence of beneficial effects of several school\u2013based programmes addressing self\u2013harm in adolescence. Such programmes include the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) (37) and the Good Behavior Game (38). The Signs of Suicide (SOS) prevention programme has also reported some beneficial effect in terms of reduction in self\u2013harm behavior (39), although the results of this programme has not been replicated in a UK population. An earlier UK school\u2013based qualitative analysis provided some evidence about the benefit of peer support (16). Other possible approaches include developing resources tailored to the needs of specific groups (as discussed above) although their impact has not been evaluated."

            "heading": "Limitations and Strengths",
            "text": "Our findings should be considered in light of some potential limitations. First, the disclosure of self\u2013harm remains highly\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 11 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 881248\nGeulayov et al. Adolescent Self-Harm and Help-Seeking\nstigmatizing among many young people (17) and it is therefore possible that we under\u2013ascertained the prevalence of self\u2013harm in our sample (40). However, we did not collect identifiers such as name, address, or postcode to preserve students\u2019 anonymity and to encourage accurate responses to questions around self\u2013 harm and other sensitive items relevant to mental health. Second, our method of self\u2013harm ascertainment was contingent on the provision of information about the method of self\u2013harm in the form of a free text. Some respondents who reported self\u2013 harming did not provide further information on their acts and therefore were not classified as having self\u2013harmed. Our estimates of the prevalence of self\u2013harm are therefore likely to be conservative especially as a distressing memory associated with the self\u2013harm incident might make it less likely for a student to describe what they had done. Third, our sample included students enrolled in and actively attending school; as such, we did not capture the experiences of young people who have disengaged from education and who are at increased risk of experiencing poor mental health (41). Fourth, our data were collected in the context of partial school closures resulting from a national COVID\u221219 lockdown and not in a standard educational setting. This may have influenced our findings. Our quantitative findings would have been strengthened by additional qualitative data to better understand the lived experience of adolescents during this time, and how they perceived access to support and services during lockdown (42). Fifth, we did not include any measure of non\u2013binary gender identification. As this is associated with an increased prevalence of self\u2013harm (43), this may have further contributed to an under\u2013ascertainment of self\u2013harm. Finally, the study did not allow for a clear separation in support sought during different timeframes. Our items about support sought after self\u2013harm were phrased to capture support sought at any point in time although we have shown that the patterns of support accessed were similar in adolescents who only reported self\u2013harm prior to the pandemic and those who self\u2013harmed during the first lockdown. Our study has several strengths. Data were collected from a large sample of students, attending 90 schools across four demographically and socio\u2013economically disparate counties in England. Data were also collected during a national COVID\u221219 lockdown incorporating partial school closures, providing a contemporaneous snapshot of adolescent self\u2013harm during this unique period."

            "text": "We found that two in five secondary school students who have self\u2013harmed did not access any sources of support. Most implied that this was not a helpful approach, thus highlighting a group likely to benefit from more accessible and appropriate support options following self\u2013harm. In the context of the COVID\u221219 pandemic\u2019s documented adverse impacts on the mental health of adolescents (44, 45), the imperative to effectively identify and support adolescents engaging in (or at increased risk of) self\u2013harm has never been more urgent. Identifying those young people who self\u2013harm but do not subsequently access support (who may be at increased risk of poor outcomes) should be\nconsidered a particularly high priority. Young people primarily turn to friends and family members for support following an act of self\u2013harm. These friends and family members may experience distress because of their concern for the young person\u2019s well\u2013 being and also because they may not feel they have the skills and knowledge on how best to support the young person who has self\u2013harmed, highlighting an important group of individuals who may benefit from guidance and support themselves."
