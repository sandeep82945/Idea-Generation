 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading this paper on macrocyclic peptide structure generation using deep learning:

1. Extend the model to more diverse macrocycle datasets beyond homodetic peptides, including heterodetic cycles and macrocycles with non-peptide backbones. This would allow the model to generalize to more drug-like macrocycles. 

2. Incorporate explicit solvation and molecular dynamics to better capture solvent effects on macrocycle conformations. The current work uses implicit solvent. Adding physics-based modeling could improve accuracy.

3. Develop conditional models that can generate macrocycle conformers based on predicted binding poses to protein targets. This would enable macrocycle optimization directly for binding.

4. Combine the backbone sampling model with sidechain prediction to generate complete macrocycle 3D structures. The current work focuses only on backbones.

5. Explore alternatives to the post-processing optimization step used for ring closure, such as constrained generation or Lagrangian relaxation, to enable end-to-end generation. The current two-step process could limit precision.
