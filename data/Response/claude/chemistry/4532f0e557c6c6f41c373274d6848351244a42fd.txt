 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further explore the structure-activity relationships of dihydrobenzofuran neolignans against T. cruzi by synthesizing and testing analogs of compounds 1, 2, and 4. Modifications could include changing functional groups, ring substitutions, stereochemistry etc. to optimize antitrypanosomal potency and selectivity. 

2. Evaluate the in vivo efficacy of compound 1 in animal models of Chagas disease to determine if the promising in vitro activity translates to in vivo antiparasitic effects. Assess pharmacokinetic properties as well. 

3. Elucidate the exact molecular mechanism of tubulin inhibition by compounds 1, 2 and 4 through biochemical assays with purified tubulin. Determine binding kinetics and effects on tubulin polymerization.

4. Test compounds 1, 2 and 4 against other protozoan parasites that utilize tubulin, such as Plasmodium, Toxoplasma and Leishmania species. Assess broad-spectrum antiparasitic potential.

5. Explore combination therapies of compound 1 with current trypanocidal drugs like benznidazole and nifurtimox to evaluate potential synergistic effects and combat drug resistance.
