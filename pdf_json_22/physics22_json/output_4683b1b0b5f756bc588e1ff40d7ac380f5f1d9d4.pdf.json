    "abstractText": "We investigate the nematic and loop-current-type orders that may arise as vestigial precursor phases in a model with an underlying pair-density wave (PDW) instability. We discuss how such a vestigial phase gives rise to a highly anisotropic stiffness for a coexisting single-component superconductor with low intrinsic stiffness, as is the case for the underdoped cuprate superconductors. Next, focusing on a regime with a mean-field PDW ground state with loop-current and nematic xy (B2g) order, we find a preemptive transition into lowand high-temperature vestigial phases with loop-current and nematic order corresponding to xy (B2g) and x2 \u2212 y2 (B1g) symmetry, respectively. Near the transition between the two phases, a state of soft nematic order emerges for which we expect that the nematic director is readily pinned away from the high-symmetry directions in the presence of an external field. Results are discussed in relation to findings in the cuprates, especially to the recently inferred highly anisotropic superconducting fluctuations [W\u00e5rdh et al., arXiv:2203.06769], giving additional evidence for an underlying ubiquitous PDW instability in these materials.",

We discuss how such a vestigial phase gives rise to a highly anisotropic stiffness for a coexisting single-component superconductor with low intrinsic stiffness, as is the case for the underdoped cuprate superconductors. Next, focusing on a regime with a mean-field PDW ground state with loop-current and nematic xy (B2g) order, we find a preemptive transition into low- and high-temperature vestigial phases with loop-current and nematic order corresponding to xy (B2g) and x2 \u2212 y2 (B1g) symmetry, respectively. Near the transition between the two phases, a state of soft nematic order emerges for which we expect that the nematic director is readily pinned away from the high-symmetry directions in the presence of an external field. Results are discussed in relation to findings in the cuprates, especially to the recently inferred highly anisotropic superconducting fluctuations [W\u00e5rdh et al., arXiv:2203.06769], giving additional evidence for an underlying ubiquitous PDW instability in these materials.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.107.134504\nI. INTRODUCTION\nOne major challenge in the study of cuprate hightemperature superconductors is to unravel the intricate interplay of \u201cintertwined\u201d electronics orders [1], and their relation to the pseudogap. Spin and charge orders have been shown to be ubiquitous phenomena in these compounds [2\u20135], as well as nematic order [6\u201310]. Another pertinent electronic order is the spatially modulated superconducting state, known as a pair-density wave (PDW) [11,12], which is conceptually related to the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO)-type [13,14] type states. The PDW came to prominence in the cuprate context to explain the anomalous suppression of superconductivity at 1/8 doping in the striped superconductor La2\u2212xBaxCuO4 [2,15\u201318]. More recently, to explain the apparent residual superconductivity in the pseudogap, in the form of a prevalent diamagnetic response [19], together with the omnipresent charge-density wave (CDW), PDW order has also been suggested as the \u201cmother state\u201d of the pseudogap itself [20,21]. Related to this, PDW has been discussed in the context of Fermi arcs [22], and the anomalous quantum oscillations at large magnetic fields [23\u201325]. More direct signatures have been reported based on scanning tunneling spectroscopy [26,27]. Furthermore, numerous evidence\n*jonatan.wardh@gmail.com \u2020mats.granath@physics.gu.se\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

Funded by Bibsam.\npoints towards a time-reversal-symmetry breaking intraunit cell magnetic order present in the pseudogap phase [28\u201333]. This has spurred the suggestion of various kinds of magnetoelectric (ME) orders, specifically so-called loop-current orders [34\u201338], which break time-reversal symmetry and parity but preserve their product.\nAnother recent theme in the physics of strongly correlated materials and the cuprates is that of vestigial orders, which refers to the emergence of a secondary order parameter that breaks a subgroup of symmetries of a multicomponent order parameter at a critical temperature that may surpass that of the underlying order. Such discrete broken symmetry has been discussed both in the context of nematic order [39\u201341] and broken time-reversal symmetry [42\u201345], as well as partially broken continuous symmetry phases of multicomponent superconductors [46].\nVestigial order is natural to appeal to as a source for intracell order when the multicomponent order is related to the point group of the lattice and has been studied as a source of nematicity, with evidence in iron-based, topological, and cuprate superconductors [41,47\u201350]. In hole-doped Ba1\u2212xKxFe2As2 a recent study shows evidence for a state with incoherent pairing but broken time-reversal symmetry consistent with a vestigial state of a multiband superconductor [51]. In the cuprates, vestigial-nematic order has been suggested to possibly arise both from spin and charge order [52,53], as well as PDW [54]. It has also been shown that loop-current orders can arise as a vestigial order that preempts a magnetoelectric PDW (ME-PDW) state [54]. In this paper we explore the occurrence and competition between various PDW-vestigial phases, motivated both by an explicit model for stabilizing PDW order based on pair-hopping interactions [55,56] (see also [57]), and by recent experiments on strongly nematic phase fluctuations in a cuprate superconductor [58].\n2469-9950/2023/107(13)/134504(18) 134504-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nFirst, we show how the relation between PDW and homogeneous superconductivity naturally generates an anisotropic superconducting state in a vestigial nematic PDW phase. In turn, this anisotropy can become strongly enhanced due to low phase stiffness [59,60], which in itself may also be related to a proximate PDW instability [55,56]. Transport measurements in La2\u2212xSrxCuO4 (LSCO) have shown evidence of an electronic nematic order [61]. These measurements indicate highly anisotropic superconducting fluctuations near the underdoped critical point, with only a small anisotropy of the normal electrons [58]. This is consistent with the collective dynamics of the superconductor being highly susceptible to nematic order, along the lines presented in the present paper. A caricature of a phase diagram based on such a scenario, with interplay between superconductivity and vestigial PDW order, is presented in Fig. 1.\nIn tetragonal symmetry, loop-current (LC) order is associated with a vector l = (lx, ly), transforming in the Eu representation. In the second part of the paper we will explore a scenario with an underlying ME-PDW state with LC order, which is invariant under reflection in the crystallographic diagonal xy (lx = ly), with subleading xy (or B2g) nematic order lxly. This phase is naturally preempted by a phase without the long-range PDW order but with vestigial LC and nematic order [54], which we refer to as an xy LC phase. We show that this preemptive transition can be split further into low- and high-temperature phases. The low-temperature phase coincides with the xy LC phase, while the high-temperature phase breaks the tetragonal symmetry differently, by developing LC order which is invariant under reflection in the crystallographic axis lx = 0, ly = 0, i.e., x2 \u2212 y2 (or B1g) nematic order l2x \u2212 l2y . We refer to this as an x2 \u2212 y2 LC phase. Besides giving a richer phase diagram with both B1g and B2g symmetric orders, arising from the same underlying ME-PDW state, we find near the first-order transition between the x2 \u2212 y2 and xy LC phases a state with approximate rotational symmetry in l .\nThis yields a very soft nematic order that is highly susceptible to external fields that may pin the nematic director away from the high-symmetry directions.\nOutline\nThis paper is composed of two main results parts and is outlined as follows. In Sec. II the considered model is discussed. This model is based on the phenomenology of an instability to a PDW state developed in [55,56], but shares features with other discussed models for a PDW state [21,57,62\u2013 64]. In the first results part, Sec. III, the model is decomposed into possible vestigial order parameters which is then used to develop an effective model of a uniform, but anisotropic, superconducting state, Eq. (18). In Sec. III B we discuss how the proximity to a PDW instability, with concomitant vestigial nematic order, can give rise to a very large stiffness anisotropy of the superconductor.\nIn the second results part, Sec. IV C, we explore the possible vestigial phases to a PDW state, implicitly assumed in Sec. III. Here we focus on a parameter regime where the xy ME-PDW is stable, exploring its potential vestigial phases."

The partition function takes the form Z = \u222b D e\u2212S with S = 1\nT \u222b x r0| ( x)|2 + \u2217( x)\u03b5( D) ( x)\n+ 1 2T \u222b x1, x2 x3, x4 U ( x1, x2, x3, x4) ( x1) \u2217( x2) ( x3) \u2217( x4),\n(1)\nwhere D = \u2212i \u2207 \u2212 2e A. The action S is given by the most general [two-dimensional (2D)] Ginzburg-Landau expression, with interaction U , to fourth order in superconducting order, which respects U (1) gauge symmetry, translational symmetry, and the point-group symmetry D4h. In order to describe an instability towards PDW order the superconducting \u201cdispersion\u201d \u03b5( p) should develop minima at finite momenta. We consider a general dispersion to sixth order in momenta p = (px, py),\n\u03b5( p) = ap2 + bp2x p2y + c(p2)2 + d (p2)3 + e ( p2x p 4 y + p2y p4x ) ,\n(2)\nand to ensure stability we take d > 0, e > \u22124d . This renormalized dispersion naturally occur in models with pairhopping interactions [55,56], but can also be considered a phenomenological model for coexisting zero- and finitemomentum superconductivity.\nThe instability to PDW order can occur in two different ways. The first, as shown in Figs. 2(a)\u20132(c), is a continuous evolution of the pairing momenta from p = 0 to finite p,\n134504-2\nparametrized by a going from positive to negative for c > 0. When a = 0 the dispersion of the homogeneous superconductor becomes flat, constituting a Lifshitz point, where the stiffness to fluctuations goes to zero. The second, occurring when c < 0 and shown in Figs. 2(d)\u20132(f), is a discontinuous jump in p through the development of a distinct metastable state at finite momenta p = 0, which becomes stable when a is decreased sufficiently. The dispersion (2) allows local minima along both the axes and the diagonals. In general eight finite momentum vectors are allowed, \u00b1Q1,\u00b1Q2,\u00b1Q1, and \u00b1Q2 given by Q1 = Q(1, 0), Q2 = Q(0, 1), Q1 = Q(1, 1)/ \u221a 2,\nand Q2 = Q(\u22121, 1)/ \u221a\n2. In order to analyze the fluctuations near the onset of these finite momentum orders we will go on reexpressing Eq. (1) by expanding in the various finite momentum superconducting order parameters. We will, however, leave the explicit form of the fourth-order term U in Eq. (1) unspecified and instead infer the expansion by considering all symmetryallowed terms. Before writing down the expression for the expanded action, we first discuss formally what terms are allowed."

The different momenta of the PDW order lead to eight different complex order parameters, and one ordinary homogeneous superconducting field 0.

We reexpress the action in these composite order parameters, integrating out the PDW fields, . The new action will thus be made up of products of these composite order parameters, that transform trivially under the full symmetry group. The breaking of symmetries and emergence of vestigial phases is then understood in the language of a Landau phase transition L = a\u03c62 + b\u03c64 where the order parameter \u03c6 develops a nonzero expectation value for a < 0, thus breaking the corresponding symmetry of the system.\nWe are especially interested in composite orders that only break the point-group symmetries, i.e., nonsuperconducting intraunit cell orders.

The polarvector order li = | Qi |2 \u2212 | \u2212Qi |2 is odd under parity and has the symmetry of a toroidal moment, which shares symmetry with the so-called loop-current (LC) order, and we will refer to it as such.

But, terms linear in derivatives imply an instability of the PDW momenta. Thus, expanding around stable local minima of Eq.

However, usually these terms are irrelevant compared to derivative terms arising to second order in fields. We will assume this is still true for the PDW\nfields, for which these terms will be neglected. However, near the Lifshitz point, where the dispersion for 0 becomes flat, derivative terms acting on 0, occurring to fourth order in fields, will be important to include. To second order in derivatives and to fourth order in fields, we can form products between an A1g derivative term and the A1g bilinears, or the B1g (B2g) derivative term with the B1g (B2g) bilinears. The first term contributes to the isotropic stiffness and is of no particular interest (it can be included in the overall renormalization); the second type of term will, however, generate an anisotropic stiffness in the presence of (vestigial) nematic order from the PDW fields.\nTerms linear in derivative do occur by coupling to the Eu bilinears. This coupling will shift the zero momentum 0 in the presence of LC. But as long as the dispersion is well approximated with a parabola, this shift will not change the dispersion around the stable point, and the response will remain isotropic. Therefore, we will neglect these terms even in the presence of LC order."

We have left out the gauge field A (absorbing it in the phase gradient), considering an extreme type-II superconductor, for which the electromagnetic field energy can be ignored. We will treat \u03c8, Nx2\u2212y2 , l on a mean-field level and only keep the uniform component (i.e., \u03c8 ( q) = \u03c8 (2\u03c0 )d\u03b4( q), etc.). The composite field \u03c8 will always have a nonzero and positive expectation value since it describes the fluctuations of the PDW state,\n\u03c8 u0 = \u222b x \u3008| Q1 |2 + | \u2212Q1 |2 + | Q2 |2 + | \u2212Q2 |2\u3009, (8)\nand is, therefore, not an order parameter. Similarly, developing a nonzero expectation value on any of the vestigial-order parameters implies\nNx2\u2212y2 u1 = \u222b x \u3008| Q1 |2 + | \u2212Q1 |2 \u2212 | Q2 |2 \u2212 | \u2212Q2 |2\u3009,\nlx u2\n= \u222b\nx \u3008| Q1 |2 \u2212 | \u2212Q1 |2\u3009,\nly u2\n= \u222b\nx \u3008| Q2 |2 \u2212 | \u2212Q2 |2\u3009, (9)\nrespectively.

(24) for the full static susceptibilities]. Without vestigial ordering, the transition temperature would be given by r\u2032 = 0. Thus we see a splitting of the transition into the ordered PDW state and that the preemptive transition enhances the transition temperature."

(Here we have only explicitly included the primary nematic fields, that are linear in the PDW fluctuations | Q|2.) This anisotropic pair mass is equivalent to an anisotropic stiffness, that may be observed, for example, as an anisotropy of the in-plane penetration depth in the superconducting state, or through an anisotropy of the near-Tc normal state conductivity due to superconducting fluctuations [58].\nThe coupling r\u20320 = r0 + \u03b30,Au0,A \u03c8A + \u03b30,A u0,B\n\u03c8B is the renormalized inverse static susceptibility. Since 0 is single component, and its amplitude is rotationally symmetric, it cannot couple directly to the nematic order, as seen from the fact that only the symmetric PDW fluctuations \u03c8A/B contribute. As discussed in Sec. II A 2, expression (18) is expected to hold even in the presence of LC order, although the superconductor would acquire a small finite momentum."

            "heading": "B. Enhancement of anisotropic superconducting fluctuations near PDW instability",
            "text": "In Eqs. (18) we have found an effective superconducting action, renormalized by the PDW fluctuations and the possible vestigial nematic order parameters Nxy and Nx2\u2212y2 . Note that the superconductor is anisotropic in its dynamics, and, at this level, the static order parameter is still isotropic. However, in the ordered SC state, the nematic order will affect the order parameter. In assuming d-wave superconductivity, there is a coupling d \u2217s Nx2\u2212y2 + H.c. (not considered here), which will induce a subleading s-wave component, effectively shifting the gap nodes. Nevertheless, as we argue below, for a superconductor with low phase stiffness, the effect of even a weak nematic field on the fluctuations may be dramatic, even though the effect on the static gap may be small.\nAs a digression, we note that this scenario of the effect of vestigial nematic order from superconducting fluctuations on the superconductor is similar in spirit but also different from electron-doped Bi2Se3. The latter has a multicomponent SC order parameter, which may itself form a vestigial nematic phase, which in turn would also affect the dynamics in the normal state [67]. In our case, instead, it is the finite momentum (PDW) superconducting components that give rise to the vestigial nematic order.\nOne way to probe the anisotropic stiffness of the superconductor is to study the contribution to the conductivity from superconducting fluctuations above Tc, the paraconductivity. At Tc, this contribution will diverge, reflecting the lifetime of Cooper pairs, and we expect to see a strong signature of the nematic order near Tc. As derived in [58], the Aslamazov-Larkin expression for the in-plane paraconductivity of a layered superconductor (interlayer distance d) with anisotropic stiffness is given by\n\u03c3 p = e 2\n16h\u0304d\n1 (T/Tc) \u2212 1 \u221a det(mp)m \u22121 p\n= princ.\ne2\n16h\u0304d\n1 (T/Tc) \u2212 1 [\u221a mp,b/mp,a 0 0 \u221a mp,a/mp,b ] , (19)\n134504-6\nwhere a, b refer to the principal axes of the conductivity, such that the last expression holds in the principal frame. Given a nematic distortion, in the form of Eqs. (18), the pair-mass quotient is given by\nmp,b mp,a\n= 1/2mp,0 +\n\u221a S2xx + S2xy\n1/2mp,0 \u2212 \u221a S2xx + S2xy , (20)\nwhere the angle of the a axis (corresponding to the axis of highest conductivity) to the crystal x axis is given by\n\u03b8 = arctan \u221a\nS2xx + S2xy \u2212 Sxx Sxy . (21)\nThus, in the presence of both Nxy (i.e., Sxy = 0) and Nx2\u2212y2 (i.e., Sxx = 0) the principal axes of conductivity will not be aligned with the symmetry axes of the crystal, and will rotate if the relative amplitude of the two fields changes with temperature.\nThere is, in fact, evidence for highly anisotropic superconducting fluctuations in transport measurements done on thin films of underdoped LSCO [58,61,68], consistent with a high pair-mass ratio mp,b/mp,a. This ratio increases as the underdoped critical point is approached, while the quotient of normal masses mb/ma remains near 1 [58]. The crystals show very weak signs of lattice distortion, remaining effectively tetragonal, which is in line with the development of electronic nematicity coupling directly to the superconductor, and not through strain [61,68], consistent with the anisotropic superconductor described in Eqs. (18). In addition, the principal axes of the paraconductivity (seen close to Tc) and the normal conductivity are in general not aligned with each other, or with the crystal axes, which is consistent with the presence of both B1g and B2b nematic order.\nNevertheless, the analysis leading up to Eqs. (18) does not by itself explain why the superconducting stiffness anisotropy would be enhanced compared to other observables that couple to nematicity, such as the normal electron conductivity, orthorhombic lattice distortions, and the superconducting gap (as discussed above). However, a natural explanation for this is evident in the expression for the pair-mass ratio (20): if the isotropic pair mass mp,0 is sufficiently large (i.e., stiffness small), the quotient mp,b/mp,a will become large even for a small nematic tensor S. Without an explicit microscopic model of how the nematic order couples to normal and paired electrons this is only a qualitative statement, but that the phase stiffness is small in the underdoped cuprates is well established [59].\nIn fact, proximity to a PDW instability provides a unified conceptual framework in which both the low stiffness and the more recently observed nematic distortion thereof can be understood. As discussed in Sec. II, and more detailed in [56], such an instability is expected to influence also the uniform component by deforming the spectrum of superconducting fluctuations giving a large effective pair mass. In other words, the availability of low-energy finite momentum pair excitations suppresses the stiffness to real-space deformations. Also, as we will further elucidate in the next section, the fluctuations of a (metastable) PDW state can generate vestigial nematic\norder that acts to deform the stiffness. Thus, approaching the finite momentum instability provides a mechanism for generating highly anisotropic superconducting fluctuations, both through creating a low phase stiffness, yielding a high susceptibility towards an anisotropic distortion, as well as providing the distortion itself. This scenario is depicted in Fig. 1, where the pseudogap is made up of vestigial phases set up by an underlying PDW state (possibly ME-PDW, as discussed in the following sections), with anisotropic superconducting fluctuations.\nIV. INTERTWINED NEMATIC AND LOOP-CURRENT ORDERS IN THE VESTIGIAL ME-PDW PHASE\nIn this section we will investigate the various possible vestigial phases from an action of the form (4). Specifically we are interested in the nature of generation of the nematic order coupling to the dynamic response of the homogeneous superconductor through the action (18).\nThe ME-PDW state argued to be consistent with polarized angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements [28] has xy LC order corresponding to ( Q1 , \u2212Q1 , Q2 , \u2212Q2 ) = ( , 0, , 0), which we will refer to as xy ME-PDW. In Fig. 3(a) the PDW momenta for the xy ME-PDW state is shown alongside its circulating current analog [35]. As a speculative scenario for the cuprates, we will consider ME-PDW as a mean-field ground state for the pseudogap phase. The overall stability of action (4) requires u0 > 0. When u1 > 0, u2 > 0, no point-group symmetry is broken. For u1 < 0 we have the possibility for nematic order without LC order, while u2 < 0 is necessary for LC order. The mean-field solutions of SA in Eq. (4) and the corresponding stable vestigial phase for u2 < 0, u1 > 0 are presented in Table II. Here and subsequently, we use the notation\n\u03b1 = u0|u2| , \u03b2 = u1 |u2| , (22)\nwhich parametrize the relative repulsion strength of fluctuation and primary nematic field. [The stability of action (4) requires \u03b1 > 0.5 for \u03b2 > 0.5 and \u03b1 > 1 \u2212 \u03b2 for \u03b2 < 0.5.]\n134504-7\nThe mean-field state breaks both continuous U (1) gauge symmetry and the discrete point-group symmetry simultaneously. In the vestigial phase, the point-group symmetry breaking preempts the continuous symmetry breaking. Given that fluctuations act to restore the continuous symmetry, we expect that the vestigial phase breaks the same point-group symmetry as the mean-field solution. From this line of reasoning we expect to find a vestigial xy LC phase [ l = (l, l ) without long-range PDW order] above the transition to the xy ME-PDW. Surprisingly, for 0.5 < \u03b2 < 1, \u03b2 < \u03b1, we find that the xy LC phase can become unstable to an x2\u2212y2 LC phase [ l = (l, 0)] at higher temperature (see Fig. 4). Thus, the meanfield ground state is preempted by a low-temperature vestigial phase, sharing the same xy symmetry, and a high-temperature vestigial phase, with a different symmetry (x2 \u2212 y2). This possibility can be understood as a result of a fluctuation-induced transition between the mean-field ground and first excited states, which are both listed in Table II. Near this transition we find a state with soft nematic order, which is discussed in Secs. IV C and V.\nIn the continuation of this section we derive the content of Table II and study the phase diagram for 0.5 < \u03b2 < 1, \u03b2 < \u03b1, presented in Fig. 4. Some details are left for Appendixes A, B, and C."

However, it is important to note that the A and B sectors support different primary nematic fields, Nx2\u2212y2 and Nxy, respectively, while both support the subleading nematic order l2x \u2212 l2y and lxly. A finite LC order implies subleading nematic order l2x \u2212 l2y , lxly transforming as B1g and B2g, respectively. The subleading nematic orders are to fourth order in PDW fields, while the primary nematic fields Nx2\u2212y2 , Nxy (listed in Table I) are to second order\nin the PDW fields. Specifically, sector A only supports the primary nematic order Nx2\u2212y2 , but not Nxy. Thus, an xy LC order, l = (l, l ), implies subleading B2g nematic order, lxly, but no primary, Nxy.

This divergence leads to\n134504-8\nfinite PDW susceptibilities (24), implying no long-range PDW order. This is just a restatement of the Mermin-Wagner theorem: Continuous symmetries will not form long-range order at finite temperature in two dimensions. The vestigial order parameters, however, being discrete Ising-like orders can break the point-group symmetries. Continuing with the 2D case, we find the mean-field equations of (17) as\nr\u2032 = rR \u2212 u0 4\u03c0\u03ba\nln [ (r\u2032 + Nx2\u2212y2 )2 \u2212 l2x ] \u00d7 [(r\u2032 \u2212 Nx2\u2212y2 )2 \u2212 l2y ], (25a)\nNx2\u2212y2 = \u2212 u1\n4\u03c0\u03ba ln (r\u2032 + Nx2\u2212y2 )2 \u2212 l2x (r\u2032 \u2212 Nx2\u2212y2 )2 \u2212 l2y , (25b)\nlx = \u2212 u2 4\u03c0\u03ba ln r\u2032 + Nx2\u2212y2 + lx r\u2032 + Nx2\u2212y2 \u2212 lx , (25c)\nly = \u2212 u2 4\u03c0\u03ba ln r\u2032 \u2212 Nx2\u2212y2 + ly r\u2032 \u2212 Nx2\u2212y2 \u2212 ly , (25d)\nwhere we introduced rR = r + u0 \u03c0\u03ba\nln(\u03ba 2), \u03ba = \u221a\n|\u03ba21 \u2212 \u03ba22 |, and as the momentum cutoff. Instead of using \u03c8 we have expressed the mean-field equations in terms of r\u2032 = r + \u03c8 ,\nwhere we assume 0 = 0. This is natural since \u03c8 describes Gaussian fluctuations of the PDW fields, which renormalizes the bare static susceptibility r\u22121.\nCare must be taken when considering solutions to Eqs. (25). First, in the absence of long-range PDW order, only solutions fulfilling r\u2032 + Nx2\u2212y2 \u00b1 lx, r\u2032 \u2212 Nx2\u2212y2 \u00b1 ly > 0 can be considered physical. Second, solutions to Eqs. (25) are generally singular, meaning that solutions with finite order do not generally coincide with solutions without order in the limiting cases. Therefore, we will have to consider all possible combinations of ordering independently. In addition to the trivial normal state without any ordering we find the following solutions.\n(i) xy LC state: LC ordered state with xy nematic order, lx = ly = 0 [69]. Solutions are presented in Appendix A.\n(ii) LC saddle-point solution: Unstable LC ordered state with both x2 \u2212 y2 and xy nematic order, lx = ly = 0. Solutions are presented in Appendix A.\n(iii) x2 \u2212 y2 LC state: LC ordered state with with x2 \u2212 y2 nematic order, lx,y = 0, ly,x = 0, and Nx2\u2212y2 = 0. Solutions are presented in Appendix B.\nSolutions with only nematic order and no LC order are of secondary interest and presented in Appendix D, for completeness.\n134504-9\nIn finding the vestigial mean-field solutions it is convenient to rescale the order parameters to unitless quantities, l\u0303x = 2\u03c0\u03balx/|u2|, and equivalently for other variables. (See Appendixes A and B for details.) However, for notational clarity we will suppress the tilde even when the parameters should be interpreted as unitless. The susceptibility gains an additional shift\nR = r\u0303R \u2212 2\u03b1 ln ( |u2|\n2\u03c0\u03ba\n) . (26)\nHere R is assumed to be tunable with temperature through its dependence on the bare susceptibility r.\nThe mean-field solutions only guarantee local stability, and we must compare the absolute energy of the different phases in order to find the ground state. The energy is presented in Appendix C. The energy expression (C2) was used to find the stable vestigial phases listed in Table II. For 0 < \u03b2 < 0.5 (1 < \u03b2), the x2 \u2212 y2 (xy) LC state is the stable state, regardless of \u03b1 (and for low enough R). In contrast, for 0.5 < \u03b2 < 1, there is a transition between the x2\u2212y2 and xy LC states for \u03b2 < \u03b1, as R (\u221d T ) is lowered, while the xy LC state is the only possible ordered state for \u03b1 < \u03b2. Thus, after including fluctuations, there is an induced transition between the wouldbe mean-field ground and first excited states (see Table II), resulting in a high-temperature x2\u2212y2 LC phase and lowtemperature xy LC phase, separated by a first-order transition."

            "text": "As a representative case of 0.5 < \u03b2 < 1, \u03b2 < \u03b1, the phase diagram and the evolution of the order parameters are presented in Fig. 4 for \u03b2 = 0.75, \u03b1 = 0.7, and \u03b1 = 1.1. (For \u03b1 = 0.75 the normal, the xy and x2\u2212y2 LC phases all coexist. It is possible to show that this holds in general for \u03b1 = \u03b2.)\nThe saddle-point solution (lx = ly > 0) only has support for a finite range of R \u2208 (Rmin, Rmax), as indicated by the green regions in Figs. 4(c1)\u20134(c4), and forms closed paths in the (lx, ly) plane [see also Fig. 7(a) in Appendix A]. As R is tuned from Rmax to Rmin, by lowering the temperature, l twists from lx = ly with Nx2\u2212y2 = 0 to lx > 0, ly = 0 with Nx2\u2212y2 > 0.\nTo explore this transition further we consider the absolute energy in terms of l [70]. The energy is presented in Fig. 5 for \u03b1 = 1.1, \u03b2 = 0.75, just below (R = 0.10) and above (R = 0.55) the support for the saddle-point solution, as well as near the transition R = 0.36.\nThe xy and x2\u2212y2 LC solutions lie on a semicircular shaped valley in the energy landscape. Because of periodicity, the number of maxima equals the number of minima. Thus, in order for the xy and x2 \u2212 y2 LC to be simultaneously stable, two intermediate maxima have to be introduced along the valley (in each quadrant). These are the lx = ly solutions, and their energy can be seen as the height of the barrier between the two (meta)stable solutions. Nevertheless, these are saddle-point solutions in the full energy landscape. As is seen\n134504-10\nboth from Figs. 4(c2) and 5(b2), this barrier height is small compared to the energy scale in the radial direction. Thus, the solutions are easily excited along the valley direction.\nThe relative smallness of the stiffness in the valley direction should be understood as a result of the valley direction being a compact dimension whose length is tunable to zero. Alternatively, it follows from expanding around a rotational invariant point l = 0. This effect is perhaps most easily seen from comparing Figs. 5(a)\u20135(c) and 5(g)\u20135(i) with Figs. 5(d)\u20135(f). In the former, the dispersion is only about twice as soft in the valley direction, while in the latter, the inclusion of three additional stationary points forces the dispersion to become even flatter in the valley direction. In the limit l \u2192 0, this feature is expected to become more pronounced. To confirm, we expand Eqs. (A2a) and (A2b) for small l , and find\n6(1 \u2212 R) \u03b1 \u2212 1 = l 2 x + l2y + O(l4),\n30(1 \u2212 \u03b2 ) \u03b2 = l2x + l2y + O(l4), (27)\ndescribing two concentric circles. This implies that at R = 5\u22124\u03b2\n\u03b2 + 5(\u03b2\u22121) \u03b2 \u03b1 all points around the valley will be arbitrarily close to a local maximum; thus the valley direction will be essentially flat. This expansion becomes exact for \u03b2 \u2192 1\u2212, and according to Table II, there will be a second-order phase transition for \u03b1 > \u03b2, where the xy and x2 \u2212 y2 LC states are degenerate. Thus, the first-order transition gets turned into a second-order transition. As a corollary, we expect a small stiffness in the valley direction whenever there is only a small region of support for the x2 \u2212 y2 solutions."

            "heading": "V. SOFT NEMATIC STATE",
            "text": "We have seen how the vicinity of the first-order transition between xy and x2\u2212y2 LC gives rise to an arbitrarily flat energy landscape, associated with a rotation of the LC order. Thus, a small field would be able to pin the LC order in any direction, promoting a state with, in general, both B1g and B2g nematic order. For concreteness, we can consider a correction to the superconducting mass, like the one found in Eqs. (18), due to the LC order\nS = [ g1 ( l2x \u2212 l2y )/ 2 g2lxly\ng2lxly \u2212g1 ( l2x \u2212 l2y )/ 2\n] . (28)\nThe principal direction of S will in general not be aligned with the crystallographic axis, as well as being easily pinned in any direction. We will refer to this as a \u201csoft\u201d nematic state. (Note that S does not constitute an XY nematic order parameter unless g1 = g2.)\nThere is some evidence for such a soft nematic state for the cuprates. A detachment of the nematic director from the lattice is seen in transport measurements on LSCO films [61], a signature which is strongest near optimum doping. This state is also expected to be sensitive to quenched disorder, which might explain the decreasing nematic domain size in bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO) [8], approaching optimum doping. This would suggest that the underlying nematic state seen in both LSCO and BSCCO is of the same\norigin, an underlying xy ME-PDW preempted by an xy and/or x2\u2212y2 LC state in turn setting up a soft nematic state, of the type described here; in LSCO the nematicity may be aligned by an external symmetry breaking field, while in BSCCO it is pinned to impurities. We include this scenario in the inset of Fig. 1, where the vestigial nematic phase is divided into a high- and low-temperature phases with x2 \u2212 y2 and xy nematic order, respectively, with a soft nematic state at the boundary of the two phases.\nEmergent overdamped Goldstone mode\nThe approximate rotational symmetry for the LC order near the first-order transition implies the existence of lowlying collective excitations. In the limit of an exact rotational symmetry this would correspond to a Goldstone mode. To explore the signatures of the soft nematic state near the transition we here consider the the spectral function of this \u201cemergent\u201d Goldstone mode.\nThe collective modes of the xy and x2\u2212y2 LC states involve not only the LC order but couple all fields in the complete \u03c8, Nx2\u2212y2 , l space; as l change, Nx2\u2212y2 and \u03c8 change accordingly. Thus, in general, a collective mode is associated with variations in the combined space of = [\u03c8, Nx2\u2212y2 , lx, ly]. In Eq. (7), we neglected the time dependence of the (bosonic) fields, corresponding to a high-temperature (classical) limit, where only the first bosonic Matsubara frequency is kept. Now we reintroduce the Matsubara frequencies to find the excitation spectra by analytic continuation to real frequencies.\nThe PDW part of the effective action (7) (for the A sector) can be written as\nSeff({ Q}, \u03c8, Nx2\u2212y2 , l )\n= \u2212 1 T \u222b \u03bc |\u03c8\u03bc|2 2u0 + |Nx2\u2212y2,\u03bc| 2 2u1 + | l\u03bc| 2 2u2 + \u222b \u03bc,\u03bc\u2032 \u2020 \u03bcG \u22121 \u03bc;\u03bc\u2032 \u03bc\u2032,\n(29)\nwhere we included an integral T \u222b 1/T\n0 d\u03c4 and fields in the Matsubara representation f (i\u03c9n) = \u222b 1/T 0 d\u03c4 e \u2212i\u03c9n\u03c4 f (\u03c4 ), with the bosonic Matsubara frequencies \u03c9n = 2\u03c0nT . We introduced the short-hand notation \u03bc = i\u03c9, k and = [ Q1 \u2212Q1 Q2 \u2212Q2 ], \u222b \u03c4 = \u222b 1/T0 d\u03c4 and \u222b\u03bc = T \u2211 i\u03c9n \u222b q.

We assume that the PDW fields are\n134504-11\ncoherently propagating, and not damped. (This would be the case if PDW arose from a strong-coupled BEC scenario [56].) The effective action is found in terms of by integrating over the PDW fields. We proceed by expanding around the uniform mean-field solution \u03b4Seff\n\u03b4 = 0, given by 0,\n(i\u03bdn, q) = 0\u03b4n,0\u03b4( q) + \u03b4 (i\u03bdn, q).

(32)\nIn the high-temperature limit, keeping only the first Matsubara term n = 0, S(0)eff (\u03c8, Nx2\u2212y2 , l ) is given by Eq. (14) (with 0 reinserted). The correction can be written\nS(2)eff = \u222b\n\u03bc\n1 2 \u03b4 i(\u03bc)L\u22121i j (\u03bc)\u03b4 j (\u03bc),\nL\u22121i j (i\u03bdn, q) = \u2212\u03b4i j Tui \u2212 i j (i\u03bdn, q). (33)\nHere L is the propagator of fluctuations of , with ui = [u0, u1, u2, u2]. The self-energy term is given by\n= \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239d 1+ 2+ 3+ 4 1+ 2\u2212 3\u2212 4 1\u2212 2 3\u2212 4 1+ 2\u2212 3\u2212 4 1+ 2+ 3+ 4 1\u2212 2 4\u2212 3\n1\u2212 2 1\u2212 2 1+ 2 0 3\u2212 4 4\u2212 3 0 3+ 4\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u23a0,\n(34)\nwhere i(i\u03bdn, q) = \u222b\ni\u03c9, k Gi(i\u03c9 + i\u03bd, k + q)Gi(i\u03c9, k), (35)\nand G\u22121i (i\u03c9, k) = \u2212i\u03c9 + T \u03c7\u22121Q(i)( k) where Q(i) = [Q1,\u2212Q1, Q2,\u2212Q2]. The propagator Li j (i\u03bdn, q) is in general off-diagonal. However, when approaching the x2 \u2212 y2 to xy LC transition from the x2\u2212y2 LC state, with lx = l0, ly = 0 and Nx2\u2212y2 = 0, i j (i\u03bdn, q) is block diagonal, i j = ab \u2295 44, a, b = 1, 2, 3. In this case the valley direction lies solely along ly, with all other fields stationary.\nThe static, zero-frequency part of the propagator L\u22121i j (0, 0) is associated with the stiffness to uniform deformation. Here L\u2212144 (0, 0) can be related with the stiffness along the valley direction, which we set to zero and identify it with the transverse propagator for a nematic director along the x axis, L\u2212144 = L\u22121\u22a5,x. After analytic continuation of\n44(i\u03bdn, q) = 2 \u222b\ni\u03c9, k G4(i\u03c9n + i\u03bdn, k + q)G4(i\u03c9n, k), (36)\nwe can obtain the retarded transverse propagator. In the hightemperature limit, after expanding in q and \u03bd/q (assuming r Nx2\u2212y2 , l , i.e., far from the PDW transition) we find\nL\u22121\u22a5,x (\u03bd, q) = \u03b7q\u03032 \u2212 i\u03b7\u2032s + O(sq\u0303) + O(s3), (37) where s = \u03bd/q\u0303, \u03b7 = 112\u03c0T \u03ba 1r2 , \u03b7\u2032 = 18T 2\u03ba 1r3/2 , and q\u0303 = q \u221a\n\u03ba1 \u2212 \u03ba2 cos(2\u03d5), where \u03d5 is the angle of q to the x axis. In Fig. 6, the spectral density Im(L\u22a5) is shown, and we see an overdamped bosonic mode, with \u03bd \u221d iq3.\nThese results are reminiscent of the results for a nematic Fermi fluid [71], where an overdamped Goldstone mode is\nfound within the broken symmetry phase. (The reason has to do with the noncommuting property of the broken symmetry and translation [72].) In a fermionic system, an overdamped bosonic mode coupling to the fermions usually leads to the destruction of the Fermi liquid. This is of special interest in cuprates as a possible origin of the strange metal phase [6,73].\nA Goldstone mode associated with spatial rotation is not expected in a crystalline system since there is no rotational symmetry. However, as seen in this work, a competition between a vestigial xy and an x2\u2212y2 LC phase leads to a very small gap and an emerging symmetry. It is intriguing to note that this phenomenology again points towards an emergent rotational symmetry near the overdoped critical point (possibly a soft nematic state), over which the strange metal phase is located. Indeed, at this level, these results are only speculative. First of all, in the model considered here, the bosonic mode does not couple directly to fermions, but to PDW fluctuations. The fate of the PDW fields and the underlying fermions is left for future work."

            "heading": "VI. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK",
            "text": "In this paper, we study vestigial orders of a PDW state with pair momenta that are aligned with the high-symmetry directions of a tetragonal crystal, focusing on phases that only break the point-group symmetry. Of particular interest is the influence of vestigial nematic order on a homogenous singlecomponent superconductor, giving rise to an anisotropic superfluid stiffness. We stress that if the nematicity arises from a PDW state, i.e., from finite momentum fluctuations of the superconducting field itself, the superconductor can become highly susceptible to this nematic distortion due to the natural proximity of a Lifshitz point with vanishing superfluid stiffness. Crucially, even a nominally weak nematic field, as observed through anisotropy of the normal electron response or the superconducting gap, may give a large relative renormalization of a small stiffness. We argue that this may explain\n134504-12\nwhy the observed anisotropy in transport measurements on LSCO [61] can be ascribed to highly anisotropic superconducting fluctuations coexisting with an essentially isotropic normal conductivity [58]. Probing vortex dynamics, also expected to be sensitive to stiffness anisotropy, near Tc, could be a fruitful pursuit to investigate this unusual manifestation of nematicity further.\nIn the later part of the paper we focus on vestigial orders of a magnetoelectric (ME) PDW, containing both nematic order and loop-current-type order. We have shown that a preemptive transition into a vestigial phase of an ME-PDW with B1g (x2 \u2212 y2) nematic order can split into high- and low-temperature phases, that correspond to distinct B1g and B2g (xy) phases. This feature is not specific to PDW, but is expected for any other field transforming in the A1g \u2295 B1g \u2295 Eu (or A1g \u2295 B2g \u2295 Eu) representation. Near the transition between the high- and low-temperature phases, the nematic order will be soft and easy to pin in either direction, yielding an approximate rotational symmetry, with possible relevance to observations of nematic order in LSCO and BSCCO. Also, as a start for further investigation, the emergence of an overdamped Goldstone mode due to this approximate rotational symmetry may have interesting implications for the single-particle properties of electrons coupling to this mode.\nIn conclusion, the results lend support and warrant further investigation into the proposal of pair-density wave order as the underlying source of the abundance of broken symmetries and exotic phenomenology seen in the cuprate superconductors.\nNote added. Recently, an experimental study of overdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x using scanning Josephson tunneling microscopy has presented evidence for a nematic state with short-range PDW order, interpreted as a disorder-pinned realization of a state with vestigial nematic PDW order [74]."

Nontrivial lx, ly > 0 solutions of Eqs. (25c) and (25d) take the form\nr\u2032 \u00b1 Nx2\u2212y2 = \u2212lx,y coth ( 2\u03c0\u03ba\nu2 lx,y\n) , (A1)\nfrom which we see the need for u2 < 0 to ensure r\u2032 \u00b1 Nx2\u2212y2 \u2212 lx,y > 0. The existence of primary B1g nematic order, Nx2\u2212y2 = 0, is equivalent to lx = ly as seen from Eq. (25b) which ensures Nx2\u2212y2 = 0 if lx = ly, while Eqs. (25c) and (25d) imply Nx2\u2212y2 = 0 if lx = ly, unless lx = ly = 0. Only considering the A sector we do not find any primary (Nxy) B2g nematic order for the lx = ly solution. However, if both the A and B sectors were stable, the subleading (lxly) B2g nematic order would induce a finite primary B2g nematic order Nxy (supported by sector B) through the coupling set by v1 in Eq. (4). In Appendix E\nwe discuss the inclusion of both sectors, but for the present discussion this will be implicit.\nBack to solving Eqs. (25): Using Eq. (A1) to simplify Eqs. (25a) and (25b) we receive two new (reduced) mean-field equations,\nR = l\u0303x coth(l\u0303x ) + l\u0303y coth(l\u0303y) 2\n+ \u03b1 ln (\nl\u0303x l\u0303y sinh ( l\u0303x ) sinh ( l\u0303y ) ) ,\n(A2a)\n0 = l\u0303x coth(l\u0303x ) \u2212 l\u0303y coth(l\u0303y) 2\n+ \u03b2 ln ( l\u0303x sinh ( l\u0303y ) l\u0303y sinh ( l\u0303x ) ) , (A2b)\nwhere we introduced the normalization l\u0303x,y = 2\u03c0\u03balx,y|u2| , and R = r\u0303R \u2212 2\u03b1 ln( |u2|2\u03c0\u03ba ). Note that Eq. (A1) is not valid in the limit lx,y \u2192 0, since it implies r\u2032 \u00b1 Nx2\u2212y2 = \u2212 u22\u03c0\u03ba , whereas Eqs. (25c) and (25d) do not put any constraints on r\u2032 \u00b1 Nx2\u2212y2 . Thus lx,y = 0 must be considered independently.\nWe find lx and ly by simultaneously solving Eqs. (A2a) and (A2b), which we can interpret graphically as in Fig. 7. Equation (A2b) is always solved for lx = ly, Nx2\u2212y2 = 0, cor-\n134504-13\nresponding to (meta)stable xy solutions. Equation (A2a) determines the evolution of l , as R is changed. For \u03b1 > 1 there is an onset of stable solutions at R = 1 and l = 0, corresponding to a second-order phase transition. For 0.5 < \u03b1 < 1 a locally stable solution occurs at a finite l for some R > 1, implying a first-order phase transition.\nEquation (A2b) also admits solutions with lx = ly, Nx2\u2212y2 = 0 for 0.5 < \u03b2 < 1, as can be seen from Fig. 7. These solutions, only supported for a finite range in R, will evolve along a curved path in the lx, ly plane, with a corresponding change in Nx2\u2212y2 as R changes. These solutions are unstable; however, as will be clarified, their existence indicates that an xy and an x2 \u2212 y2 LC state are simultaneously stable. We will refer to this solution as the saddle-point solution since it constitutes a saddle point in the energy landscape. Indeed, in Sec. IV C we will see how 0.5 < \u03b2 < 1 admits a first-order transition between the xy and x2\u2212y2 LC states, with the possibility of a superheated and supercooled phase.\nAPPENDIX B: x2\u2212y2 LC STATE, lx,y = 0, ly,x = 0 Now we assume the stability of the x2\u2212y2 LC solutions with only one finite LC order component, say, lx > 0. Equation (25d) puts no constraint on r\u2032 \u2212 Nx2\u2212y2 , while Eq. (25c) still implies r\u2032 + Nx2\u2212y2 = \u2212lx coth( 2\u03c0\u03bau2 lx ). For physical solutions we must require u2 < 0 as well as r\u2032 \u2212 Nx2\u2212y2 > 0. In this case, we can directly solve for r\u2032 and Nx2\u2212y2 using Eqs.

            "text": "Bilinears of our model transform in two distinct sectors, which we denote A and B. The stabilities of these two sectors, determined by the local minima of the dispersion (2), are independent, and we can consider situations where either one or both of the sectors are present.\nThe structures of both sectors are identical, and the above analysis holds equally for both sectors if we take into account that the states refer to the principal axes of the A and B sector\nframes, respectively, which are rotated 45\u25e6 to each other. For concreteness, the x2 \u2212 y2 LC and xy LC phase of the A sector map to the x2 \u2212 y2 = xy LC and xy = x2 \u2212 y2 LC phase of the B sector.\nIf both sectors are present they will couple through fourthorder terms, tuned by v0,1 in Eq. (4). We will study this situation by including a weak interaction between the two sectors. Including nonzero couplings v0,1 in Eq. (4) means that the matrix M in the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation (5) will no longer be diagonal. Instead it will take the form\nM = [\nMA MAB MTAB MB\n] , MAB = \u23a1 \u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3 v0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 v1\u221a 2 \u2212 v1\u221a\n2 0 0 v1\u221a\n2 v1\u221a 2 \u23a4 \u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6, (E1)\nand the auxiliary field vector = [\u03c8A, Nx2\u2212y2 , lA,x, lA,y, \u03c8,Nxy, lB,x, lB,y].

(E2)\nThe third term represents interaction between the A and B sectors, and the first two terms refer to the action of the A and B sectors, respectively [Eq. (17)]. Due to the inversion of the off-diagonal matrix, M, the couplings become renormalized [indicated by the tilde in (E2)]: u\u03030,(AB) = u0,(AB) \u2212\nv20 u0,(AB) , u\u03032,(AB) = u2,(AB) \u2212 v 2 1 u2,(AB) , v\u03030 = v0 \u2212 u0,Au0,Bv0 , and v\u03031 = v1 \u2212 u2,Au2,Bv1 . The two sectors do not couple directly through the primary nematic order parameters Nx2\u2212y2 , Nxy. The bilinear term in the LC orders of the two sectors implies mutual induction: A finite LC order in one sector will induce LC order in the other sector.

The correction to the vestigial mean-field solutions because of finite coupling between the sectors is illustrated in Fig. 9, where black\n(red) arrows indicate the LC order in the A (B) sector. In Fig. 9(a) the A sector is ordered in its x2 \u2212 y2 LC state (lA,x > 0, lA,y = 0), while the B sector is not ordered to zero order in v1. By turning on the coupling, an LC order in the B sector is induced, lB,x = lB,y = O(v1). This state, being symmetric for reflections in the x axis, already has a finite expectation value for the primary nematic field, Nx2\u2212y2 , in the unperturbed case [analogous case for the B sector is shown in Fig. 9(b)]. Similar cases are shown in Figs. 9(c)\u20139(e), where no additional primary nematic order is induced, since it is present already for v1 = 0.\nIn contrast, for the case noted above, an xy LC phase in the A sector, which only has subleading xy nematic order, lA,xlA,y, the coupling will induce a primary xy nematic Nxy (stemming from the B sector). This is depicted in Fig. 9(f) [and similarly in Figs. 9(g) and 9(h)].\n[1] E. Fradkin, S. A. Kivelson, and J. M.
