    "abstractText": "In today\u2019s competitive and fast-evolving business environment, it is a critical time for organizations to rethink how to make talent-related decisions in a quantitative manner. Indeed, the recent development of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have revolutionized human resource management. The availability of large-scale talent and management-related data provides unparalleled opportunities for business leaders to comprehend organizational behaviors and gain tangible knowledge from a data science perspective, which in turn delivers intelligence for real-time decision-making and effective talent management at work for their organizations. In the last decade, talent analytics has emerged as a promising field in applied data science for human resource management, garnering significant attention from AI communities and inspiring numerous research efforts. To this end, we present an up-to-date and comprehensive survey on AI technologies used for talent analytics in the field of human resource management. Specifically, we first provide the background knowledge of talent analytics and categorize various pertinent data. Subsequently, we offer a comprehensive taxonomy of relevant research efforts, categorized based on three distinct application-driven scenarios: talent management, organization management, and labor market analysis. In conclusion, we summarize the open challenges and potential prospects for future research directions in the domain of AI-driven talent analytics.",

To cope with the fast-evolving business environment and maintain competitive edges, it is critical for organizations to rethink how to make talent-related decisions in a quantitative manner. Indeed, thanks to the era of big data, the availability of large-scale talent data provides unparalleled opportunities for business leaders to understand the rules of talent and management, which in turn deliver intelligence for effective decision-making and management for their organizations [172, 180]. Along this line, as an emerging applied data science direction in human resource management, talent analytics has attracted a wide range of attention from both academic and industry circles. Specifically, talent analytics, also as known as workforce analysis or people analytics, focuses on leveraging data science technologies to analyze extensive sets of talent-related data, empowering organizations with informed decision-making capabilities\n\u2022 This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

In practice, talent analytics plays a pivotal role in strategic human resource management (HRM), encompassing diverse applications such as talent acquisition, development, retention, as well as examining organizational behaviors and external labor market dynamics. Generally, the research directions of talent analytics can be divided into three categories, as illustrated in Figure 1, including talent management, organization management, and labor market analysis.\nTo be specific, first, talent management is a constant strategic process of attracting and hiring the high-potential employees, training their skills, motivating them to improve their performance, and retaining them to keep organizational competitiveness. In this particular scenario, talent analytics primarily focus on individual-level analysis. For instance, it can help human resources managers find the right talents for different jobs in a practical way [66, 162, 212],\nar X\niv :2\n30 7.\n03 19\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C Y\n] 3\nJ ul\n2 02\n3\n2 and it can reasonably make the employee performance or turnover prediction [4, 108]. Second, organization management is the art of fostering collaboration among talents and guiding the organizations toward achieving success. In this scenario, talent analytics can diagnose the health of an organization and measure the organizational performance by leveraging various relationship information between talents or organizations, such as organizational structure, communication patterns, and project collaborations [56, 213]. It can also assist the organization in effectively structuring and optimizing teams [8, 197]. Third, talent analytics can be applied from an external and macro perspective, i.e., applied to labor market analysis scenario. It is crucial to devise talent and organizational strategies. For instance, by analyzing talent demands within the labor market, managers can effectively craft recruitment strategies [223, 231].\nWhile the traditional studies around talent analytics have achieved great theoretical and practical success, the field of research has been facing dramatic changes in recent years. On the one hand, talent analytics is facing digital disruption, which enables the availability of large-scale relevant data. For instance, online recruitment platforms are rapidly developing and have amassed a significant amount of recruitment data. One such platform, Indeed, a worldrenowned job search site, had 11.3 million active jobs as of January 2022 [30]. Meanwhile, Linkedin, the largest online professional network, had 774 million members from around 200 countries as of March 2022 [120], building up a wealth of labor market data. Moreover, numerous enterprises are setting up their Digital Human Resource Management Systems (Digital HRMS), enabling the collection, storage, and processing of talent and organizational information in a digital environment [191]. On the other hand, with the advent of talent-related big data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have rapidly revolutionized a series of research and practices in this field at an alarming rate, which in turn deliver intelligence for decision-making and management for their organizations. For instance, the deep learning methods have enabled the new paradigm in person-job fit [24, 162, 212, 232] and person-organization fit [183, 185], so as to achieve the efficient and accurate talent selection and development. Text mining methods, such as probabilistic topic models, have been adopted in the employer brand analysis based on the large-scale labor market data [117, 118], which enable the forward-looking strategic plans created for the business. Meanwhile, in recent years, several high-tech companies are gradually incorporating AI technologies into their HRMS. As an illustration, IBM leverages AI technology to achieve a remarkable 95 percent accuracy in predicting employees who are considering leaving their positions, which saved IBM $300 million in retention costs [167].\nThis survey attempts to provide a comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving AI techniques for talent analytics. Based on our investigation, we first provide a detailed taxonomy of relevant data laying a data foundation for leveraging AI techniques to understand talents, organizations, and management better. Along this line, we introduce the research efforts of the AI techniques for talent analytics from three aspects, including talent management, organization management, and labor market analysis. Finally, we identify\nchallenges for future AI-based talent analytics and suggest potential research directions.\nMoreover, in order to help the readers learn more effectively, we highlight the systematic resources provided in this survey as follows,\n\u2022 Table 1 summarizes the data for talent analytics. \u2022 Table 2 summarizes the recent AI-based talent analytics\nefforts in the talent management scenario. \u2022 Table 3 summarizes the recent AI-based talent analytics\nefforts in the organization management scenario. \u2022 Table 4 summarizes the recent AI-based talent analytics\nefforts in the labor market analysis scenario."

            "heading": "2.1.1 Recruitment Data",
            "text": "Recruitment data in pre-employment mainly includes the following types: Resume: A resume or Curriculum Vitae (CV) is a document that outlines a person\u2019s background, skills, and accomplishments, which plays a vital role in the recruitment process as it serves to facilitate talent screening and assessment [162, 173]. It serves as an important tool for job seekers to showcase their qualifications and suitability for a job position. Recently, a large amount of resume data, in either Word or PDF format, has accumulated with the development of online recruitment. As shown in Figure 2, a resume typically comprises structured information such as gender, age, and education, as well as semi-structured information like educational experience, work experience, and project experience. Accordingly, several resume parsing techniques have been developed to extract the redundant information [37, 38, 211]. On such basis, substantial effort are posed in talent analytics with resume data from different perspectives. For instance, Yao et al. [210] introduced a keyphrase extraction approach to explore job seekers\u2019 skills in resumes, and Pena et al. [154] used image information in resume data to improve screening performance and explore fairness issue. Moreover, several studies have proposed leveraging the text mining techniques to determine the matching degree between jobs and job seekers based to their resumes [24, 162, 232]. In addition, the resumes also encompass the career trajectories of the job seekers.

In this phase, Zhang et al. [217] introduced the ResumeVis system to visualize the individual career trajectory and mobility within different organizations. And the researchers further analyzed the sequential patterns of the career trajectory and proposed personalized career development recommendation [138, 192, 221]. Job Posting: A job posting is an advertisement for a vacant position that provides job seekers with information on the job description and requirements. The posting offers applicants a clear understanding of what the position is responsible for and what qualifications are necessary. Recently, the proliferation of online recruitment services has made it increasingly common to publish job postings as web pages. Figure 3 illustrates a typical job posting that comprises structured information, such as the salary range and education requirements, as well as the semi-structured content that includes job duties descriptions and abilities requirements. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to deal with such a large corpus of data by Human Resource (HR) experts manually. To this end, researchers have attempted to reduce the dependence on manual labor by using neural network-based techniques, particularly NLP, on voluminous job postings. As mentioned before, considerable effort has been posed in Person-Job Fit [24, 126, 162, 163, 232], which aims to match the job postings with suitable resumes. Moreover, Shen et al. [173, 174] leveraged the latent variable model to jointly model the job description, candidate resume, and interview assessment, which can further benefit several downstream applications such as person-job fit and interview question recommendation. In order to reduce the expense of manual screening, researchers also extracted the job entities from postings and generated interview questions\nautomatically [113, 161, 164, 175]. Apart from these infirm applications, some studies are carried out to provide comprehensive insights into the global labor market. For instance, researchers have proposed several data-driven methods for salary analysis across different companies and positions [43, 99, 137]. Zhang et al. [223] utilized largescale job postings from one of the largest Chinese online recruitment websites and forecast fine-grained talent demand in the recruitment market. Moreover, some studies aim to measure the popularity of job skills and forecast their evolving trends [201, 204]. Along this line, Sun et al. [184] further focus on measuring the values of job skills based on massive job postings, contributing to the quantitative assessment of job skills. Interview-related Data: Interview-related data is typically collected during the interview process and serves the purpose of evaluating applicants\u2019 overall qualifications for the position they are applying for. In general, an interview can be conducted either in-person or through video, resulting in textual or video-based assessments, respectively. Both of these two kinds of data enable comprehensive evaluations for the candidates and facilitate the integration of AI in HR. To address the subjectivity of traditional interviews, Shen et al. [173, 174] utilized the latent variable model to explore the relationship among job descriptions, candidate resumes, and textual interview assessments. The results provide an interpretable understanding of job interview assessments. Indeed, textual interview assessments within a company are usually private and sensitive, whereas video assessments draw more attention. For instance, several studies extract multimodal features from the videos for automatic analysis of job interviews [40, 41]. In addition, Hemamou et al. [79] proposed a hierarchical attention model to predict the hirability of the candidates using multimodal information, including text, audio, and video. Along this line, Chen et al. [39] leveraged a hierarchical reasoning graph neural network to automatically score candidate competencies using textual features in asynchronous video interviews."

            "text": "Regarding the development of employees within a company, a significant amount of employee data has been accumulated, including training records and individual work outcomes. An overview of employee-related data is shown in Figure 4. Employee Profiles: Employee profiles typically describe an individual based on two main aspects: demographic characteristics and individual work outcomes. In specific, the former branch includes characteristics such as age, gender, and education levels [153], which can be used to enhance employee representations and benefit various downstream analyses, such as career mobility prediction [165, 228] and performance forecasting [127]. In addition to these static variables, individual work outcomes depict the dynamic career development from different dimensions, such as performance appraisals, promotion, and turnover records. In particular, a performance appraisal is a systematic evaluation of an employee\u2019s job performance and productivity that is typically conducted by line managers. Besides, the promotion and turnover records show employee movements within and across companies, respectively. All of\n4\nthis information contributes to further insights into employee dynamics. For instance, researchers have leveraged performance appraisals to identify the high-potential talents within a company [214]. Li et al. [108] utilized static profiles, performance appraisals, and reporting lines of employees to model career development within a company, focusing on turnover and career progression. Sun et al. [183] proposed to capture the dynamic nature of person-organization fit based on individual profiles, reporting lines, and communication records. To investigate the contagious effect of turnovers, researchers have utilized both employee profiles and turnover data [187, 188]. Furthermore, Hang et al. [75] leveraged five kinds of standardized data, including employee turnover records, to predict the turnover probability and period. Training Records: Employee training is a program designed to improve the performance of employees by equipping them with specific skills. Ongoing employee training has proven to be crucial in attracting and retaining top talent [169]. Typically, the training record describes the learning path of an employee, which is a sequence of different skills. Based on these training records, considerable effort has been devoted to exploring the learning patterns of employees. For instance, Wang et al. [193, 194] utilized both learning records and skill profiles of employees from a high-tech company in China to develop a personalized online course recommendation system. Along this line, Srivastava et al. [182] collected employees\u2019 training and work history from a large multinational IT organization to provide personalized next training recommendations. In addition, some researchers also provided insights into employee competency study [82, 109, 121, 200]. For instance, multi-dimensional features, including learning and training dimensions, were collected from a Chinese stateowned enterprise to provide competency assessment for employees [121]."

            "text": "An organizational structure is a system that outlines how activities are directed toward the achievement of organizational aims [158], which plays an important role in decisionmaking and knowledge management. Generally, an organization is commonly represented as a hierarchical tree structure, which can take on diverse forms, such as matrix, flat, and network structures. Figure 5 shows several common types of organizational structures. Typically, existing studies explore these complex structures from various dimensions, such as reporting lines and in-firm social networks.\nReporting lines are generally the most representative aspect of an organizational structure, which delineates how authority and responsibility are allocated in an organization.\nRegarding this point, Sun et al. [183, 185] developed an organization structure-ware convolutional neural network to hierarchically extract compatibility features for measuring person-organization fit and its impact on talent management. Nevertheless, due to privacy concerns, mainstream studies utilize in-firm social networks for human resource management. In general, an in-firm social network can be formed from email or Instant Messaging (IM) records across employees. For example, text-based communication has been used by several machine learning classifiers to identify group mood [100]. Besides, Cao et al. [31] leveraged the lasso regression model to explore team viability using text conversations of online teams. In addition to social networks, researchers have also taken other information into account. For example, Ye et al. [214] utilized both email communication and a high-potential talent list to identify employees with high potential. Along this line, Teng et al. [187] further utilized datasets from three sources for organizational turnover prediction, including profile and turnover, social network, and job levels."

            "text": "Apart from the aforementioned internal data, external sources also contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the labor market, which can be broadly classified into two categories: social media platforms and job search websites. Social Media: Widely-used social media platforms that contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the labor market include Twitter 1, Facebook 2, and news reports. With the help of NLP and Topic Model techniques [26], numerous studies have been carried out to explore the semantic information in this corpus. For example, more than 60,000 tweets related to nine energy companies were collected for sentiment analysis expressed on Twitter [87]. To gain further insight into the impact of public opinion, Spears et al. [181] collected earnings reports and news articles spanning eight years from four companies. The results indicate that companies may face a decline in valuation when they receive negative publicity. Job Search Websites: Recent years have witnessed the rapid growth of job search websites, such as Indeed 3, LinkedIn 4,\n1. https://twitter.com 2. https://www.facebook.com 3. https://www.indeed.com 4. https://www.linkedin.com\n5\nand Glassdoor 5. Specifically, Indeed and Glassdoor allow users to comment on a company, providing an overall understanding of the employer brand. For instance, Lin et al. [117, 118] collaboratively modeled both textual (i.e., reviews) and numerical information (i.e., salaries and ratings) for learning latent structural patterns of employer brands. In addition, Bajpai [16] leveraged the data from Glassdoor to perform aspect-level sentiment analysis. Along this line, large-scale reviews of Fortune 500 companies are collected to identify topics that matter to employees [170]. Differently, LinkedIn provides a wide range of business services, including job listings, professional profile creation, and career development services, with personal profiles being the most analyzed, as they describe users\u2019 employment history. For example, Park et al. [151] used LinkedIn\u2019s employment history data from more than 500 million users over 25 years to construct a labor flow network of over 4 million firms worldwide, demonstrating a strong association between the influx of educated workers and financial performance in detected geo-industrial clusters.\nFurthermore, there are also several third-party business investigation platforms that offer detailed information about companies and their board members\u2019 relationships, such as Crunchbase 6, Owler 7, Tianyancha 8 and Aiqicha 9. These details can be viewed as complementary information to the job search websites. Building upon this foundation, one can gain deeper insights into the aligned companies and conduct more relevant research, such as analyzing cooperative and competitive relationships [48] and providing investment target recommendations [42]."

According to a Forbes article, US corporations spend nearly 72 billion annually on various recruiting services, and the global amount is likely three times larger 10. However, traditional talent recruitment methods rely heavily on the personal knowledge and experience of recruiters, which may introduce bias due to the subjective nature of the process.

However, determining the required capabilities and prioritizing them in line with the job duties can be challenging, especially when recruiters have limited experience and domain knowledge. An intuitive solution to address this challenge is to generate job requirements in a data-driven manner, based on the job duties.

The target of job posting generation is to learn a model M which can generate fluent and rational job requirement Ynew when a new\njob duty Xnew is given.\nTechnically, the task of job posting generation can be viewed as a text-to-text generation problem, where the job duties and job requirements are typically long sequences of text. To address this task, sequence-to-sequence models in an encoder-decoder architecture are commonly employed, as depicted in Figure 6. For instance, Liu et al. [122] applied two Long-Short Time Memory (LSTM) layers as the encoder and decoder, respectively, to extract the key information from job duties and generate the job requirement,\n7 respectively. Since it is important to precisely use and organize skill-related keywords in job requirements, they implemented the decoder in a two-pass manner. The firstpass decoder is to predict skill-related keywords, while the second-pass decoder aims to generate fluent text guided by the predicted skills. In particular, the attention mechanism is used to combine hidden states in the LSTM layer of the encoder with context information when predicting skills in the decoder. Furthermore, Qin et al. [160] trained a neural topic model in job duties to capture the global topic information. The topic distribution of each job duty is used as the context information to guide the generation of each word in the LSTM-based decoder."

            "heading": "3.1.2 Talent Searching",
            "text": "Talent Searching aims to find suitable candidates based on the search query given by a recruiter or a hiring manager. Formally, considering the candidate set R = {R1, .., Rn}, where each candidate Ri denotes her resume consisting of work experience, education experiences, and so on. Then, talent searching can be approached as an information retrieval task: Definition 3.2 (Talent Searching). Given the candidate set\nR and a searching query q consisting of search criteria, the goal of talent searching is to determine a subset of candidates U \u2282 R satisfying the search criteria, and rank those candidates based on the fitness.\nIntuitively, to solve this problem, we need to measure the fitness between the search query q and each resume Ri. However, in industrial practice, the efficiency of computing the fitness for each pair (q,Ri) is a challenge due to the large scale of R. Therefore, before the online talent search, it is essential to derive the crucial representation from the resume in the offline pipeline, even clustering them first to reduce computation. Resume Representation Learning. Here, researchers aim to extract crucial and comprehensive information from resumes. Most related works primarily focus on analyzing the textual content. Then, the problem is transferred into an NLP problem, and various language models have been employed to represent the resume content, such as LSTM [114], Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) [22, 61, 114], Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) [126], and semantic processing technologies [35]. Recently, knowledge graphs based on the keywords in the resume have also been introduced to enhance the representation of the resume [196]. In addition to understanding the textual content, the classification of resume blocks is another crucial step in resume information extraction, which aims to distinguish the semantic purpose of different resume blocks. Both the textual content in each block and the interrelation between different blocks should be considered. Therefore, some sequence models have been applied to this task, such as Conditional Random Field (CRF) [37], Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) [203], and Transformer [211]. Online Talent Searching Engine. After extracting information from the resume, we turn to introduce the AI-based talent searching engine by employing resume representation learning in the offline pipeline. The core task is to rank candidates using different representation techniques and AI-\nbased models. For example, Ozcaglar et al. [148] proposed a two-level ranking system to integrate structured candidate features by combining Generalized Linear Mixed (GLMix) models and Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) models. This approach utilizes recruiter actions as supervised information to learn to rank candidates. In addition, Manad et al. [129] extracted skills from unstructured candidate resumes and ranked them by scoring the proficiency of the skills. Furthermore, Geyik et al. [65] involved recruiter\u2019s immediate feedback on the recommendation results to cluster candidates based on recruiter\u2019s intent. Then, a multiarmed bandit-based approach was developed to choose the appropriate intent cluster for the current recruiter, followed by ranking the candidates in this cluster. Unlike the aforementioned works, where searching queries are given by recruiters, Ha et al. [72, 73] designed a new talent search engine to recommend candidates based on ideal candidates, where the query is constructed from the keywords extracted from the ideal candidates."

            "heading": "3.1.3 Person-Job Fitting",
            "text": "In this phase, we introduce several applications of AI technologies in the task of Person-Job Fitting (PJF), which focuses on measuring the matching degree between a job posting, consisting of job duties and job requirements, and a candidate\u2019s resume, consisting of work and educational experiences. Following [163], we denote a job application S = (J,R) as the tuple of a job posting J , a resume R, and a binary label y that corresponds to the recruitment result, where y = 1 indicates that the candidate has been selected for further interviews. Based on this basis, the problem of person-job fit can be formalized as a text matching problem. Definition 3.3 (Person-Job Fitting). Given a set of job appli-\ncations S , where each application S \u2208 S contains a job posting J and a resume R, as well as the corresponding recruitment result label y, the target of Person-Job Fit is to learn a predictive model M for measuring the matching degree between J and R, and then the corresponding result label y can be predicted.\nIn the following, we will introduce several AI-based solutions for this problem, along with two extended applications: job recommendation and talent recommendation. AI-based Solutions for PJF. The early research efforts in the field of Person-Job Fit with AI-based technologies can be traced back to [128]. They proposed that the compatibility between a job and a candidate is often dependent on underlying factors that may not be explicitly stated in the job posting or the candidate\u2019s resume. To address this issue, the authors developed a latent variable model to represent job requirements and candidate abilities, and formulated PJF as a bilateral matching problem from a demands-abilities perspective. Since then, several studies have explored the use of AI-based technologies to extract job and candidate profiles from textual data. For instance, Zhu et al. [232] introduced a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based neural network to extract representation vectors from job postings and resumes. They then evaluated the fit between a candidate\u2019s qualifications and the job requirements by measuring the similarity between these vectors. Qin et al. [162, 163] used LSTM to model the text sequence and\n8 applied ability-aware attention strategies to measure the importance of each job requirement or candidate\u2019s ability on the final PJF decision. Similarly, Luo et al. [24] treated job postings and resumes as multi-sentence documents and utilized Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BIGRU) and word-level attention to model sentences and documents. Luo et al. [126] extended these efforts by integrating LSTM, CNN, and attention models to handle different types of structured textual information, such as skills and experiences, and proposed an adversarial learning-based framework to enhance expressive representations. Recently, Lavi et al. [104] applied the fine-tuning BERT model to handle the noise and heterogeneous application data. Specifically, they matched jobs and candidates with both classification and similarity-based objectives. Yao et al. [212] introduced a skill knowledge graph to enhance the representation of job postings and resumes in a knowledge-aware manner.\nBesides capturing textual features from application data, several works have explored including other related information to improve the performance or address challenges in the PJF task. For example, it has been reported that certain numerical and categorical attributes of jobs and candidates are also important and helpful, such as career level, education, company name, tag, and region [76, 77, 91]. As a result, several neural network-based approaches have been designed to capture the comprehensive interaction of different types of data, such as Factorization Machine [91], CNN [77], and Self-Attention [76]. Additionally, job-resume relation graphs have been used to aggregate useful evidence from similar jobs or resumes [23] with Graph Neural Networks (GNN), where jobs or resumes are considered as nodes and their relation-specific connections, such as job applications, are considered as links. Meanwhile, the potential semantic relation among different job categories has been noted and leveraged to tackle the availability of labeled data among them with domain adaptation technologies [24]. Moreover, the user interaction record on online recruitment services is also an important complementary feature to represent both jobs and candidates. Specifically, Yan et al. and Jiang et al. [91, 206] integrated historical interviewed applicants for a job posting and historically applied jobs for a particular talent to complement and enhance the representation learning for jobs and candidates. The hidden idea is that historical interview choices and job applicants reveal the preference of jobs and candidates for each other. Fu et al. [63] further explored users\u2019 dynamic preferences in browsing, clicking, and online chat behaviors and regarded them as the cascading relations between jobs and candidates. Applications for Talent Recommendation. One intuitive application of person-job fit is talent recommendation, which involves finding suitable candidates for a specific job. Given a specific job posting J and a set of candidates {R1, R2, ..., Rn}, a well-trained PJF architecture can be used to measure the fitness of each pair (J,Ri) and rank the candidates. While the PJF models mentioned previously can all be applied in this context, some studies have attempted to enhance candidate ranking with a more comprehensive evaluation. For instance, personality traits have been identified as critical success factors for job performance and organizational effectiveness [83]. Researchers have mined these traits through linguistic analysis of social media text\ndata [59, 60, 67, 139]. Moreover, by integrating various measurements and data sources, researchers and companies have developed electronic recruitment (e-recruitment) systems for more effective and efficient recruitment, particularly in the talent pre-screening stage [59, 60]. These systems have been demonstrated to have a positive impact on recruitment [190]. Applications for Job Recommendation. As a dual problem of talent recommendation, job recommendation aims to recommend jobs for a specific candidate. The PJF architecture, which can be built on any PFJ models mentioned previously, can output the fitness of each job in the job set {J1, J2, ..., Jn} for the given candidate R. This can be valuable in recruitment scenarios where job application redistribution is necessary, such as position assignments for candidates in campus recruitment or for employees in internal position adjustment. Job recommendation can also be used in online recruitment services to assist job seekers in finding suitable job opportunities [6, 54, 84]."

A critical task is how to design appropriate questions for comprehensively assessing the competencies of employees. In this phase, personalized question recommendation has emerged as a feasible approach, that selects the right questions from the question set based on the candidate and the job position. Along this line, Qin et al. [164] first proposed to recommend personalized question sets for various applications, taking into consideration both job requirements and candidates\u2019 experiences. In particular, to enhance the performance of the recommendation system, a knowledge graph of job skills was built using query logs from the biggest search engine, Baidu. Substantially, Shi et al. [175] proposed an automated system for generating personalized screening questionnaires based on job postings. They encoded the job posting with the BERT model, selected the question templates with a Multi-Layer Perception(MLP) Classifier, and extracted necessary parameters from the templates using feature-based regression models. To cope with the substantial risk of bias arising from the subjective nature of traditional in-person interviews, Shen et al. [174] proposed to learn the representative perspectives of inperson interviews from the successful job interview records in history. With the help of topic models, they represented job postings, resumes, and interview assessment reports in an interpretable way. The potential relationships among them are also mined to recommend questions or skills that should be estimated during interviews [173, 174]."

            "text": "Assessment scoring is another critical problem in talent management, that evaluates the competency of candidates\n9 or employees based on their performance. Typically, this problem can be formulated as a binary classification problem as follows: Definition 3.4 (Assessment Scoring). Based on the observed\nattributes xu of employee u, the target is to predict whether she is competent for the current job, i.e., P (Y = 1 | xu). In this phase, substantial effort has been posed in the interviewing phase [39, 40, 41, 144]. For instance, Naim et al. [144, 145] predicted overall interview scores based on 82 features from 138 recorded interview videos covering three dimensions: prosodic, lexical, and facial information. With the progression of recruitment techniques, Asynchronous Video Interview (AVI) has received considerable attention from researchers. Specifically, Chen et al. [40, 41] proposed to extract features from a monologue video interview multimodal corpus, including text, audio, and video. Several shallow classification models are utilized to make the prediction, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). To help recruiters, Hemamou et al. [79]collected a corpus of over 7,000 candidates who participated in asynchronous video job interviews for real positions and recorded videos of themselves answering a set of questions. Based on such a massive dataset, they designed a hierarchical attention model to predict the hireability of the candidates. To identify the relevant parts of an answer, the authors also developed attention mechanisms to extract fine-grained temporal information [78]. Moreover, Chen et al. [39] introduced Graph Neural Networks to construct the dependency relation between questions. Differently, they only used the automatic speech recognition transcriptions in the AVI and scored on multiple Question-Answer pairs. Besides, Singhania et al. [178] first investigated fairness with regard to gender and race in the video interview.\nIn addition to the interviewing phase, there is still a focus on predicting competency based on employee profile information. For instance, Liu et al. and Hong et al. [82, 121] applied the SVM model to predict the competence level of civil servants and highway construction foremen, respectively. Furthermore, Li et al. [109] compared the performance of multiple traditional classifiers such as SVM, RF, and Adaboost in competency evaluation and found that the prediction result is not ideal based solely on structured personal static data. For better performance, more unstructured and dynamic data, such as textual data or social networks can be involved, which may be a significant direction for future work."

Much research in this direction is concerned with student education [58, 119, 150]. Recently, some effort has also been posed in the talent management field [182, 193, 194, 209, 229]. Typically, we formalize this problem as follows: Definition 3.5 (Course Recommendation). Given the sequen-\ntial history learning record Hu of the employee u and her/his profile Su, the target is to predict the rating of employee u on course c, i.e., E[r | Hu,Su, c]. As a recommendation task, most of the methods in the recommendation system can be utilized to conduct course recommendations. However, unlike traditional item recommendation, where the decision is determined by the users\u2019 rating, more attention should be paid to mining employees\u2019 competencies and their needs for further development from side information such as the employee\u2019s profiles. Therefore, Wang et al. [193, 194] used a topic model to extract the latent interpretable representations of the employee\u2019s current competencies from their skill profiles, as well as a recognition mechanism to explore the personal demands from learning records. Then, they integrated the collaborative filtering algorithm with the Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) to develop an explainable course recommendation system. In addition to learning records, Srivastava et al. [182] also introduced work history into the learning content recommendation and defined a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to extract the past training patterns. Yang et al. [209] introduced a contextualized knowledge graph embedding to recommend training courses to the talent in an explainable manner."

Typically, the problem can be formulated as a classification task as follows: Definition 3.6 (Promotion Prediction). Given the history\nrecord Hti in a certain period t of the employee i, the target is to predict the probability of a promotion P (Mi = 1 | Hti). In this phase, Yuan et al. [215] suggested that workrelated interactions and online social connections are strongly predictive and correlate with promotion and resignation. Along this line, Long et al. [124] used Random Forest to predict promotions based on demographic and job features. However, these methods may not fully capture the complexity and dynamism of career development. To address this, Li et al. [108] proposed a novel survival analysis approach, where predicting promotion events is transformed into estimating the expected duration of time until promotion occurs."

Given the history\nrecord Hti in a certain period t of employee i, the target is to predict the probability of a turnover P (Ei = 1 | Hti). For instance, Nagadevara [143] used five data mining techniques to predict turnover, including MLP, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc. The results reveal that absenteeism and lateness, job content, demographics, and experience in the current team are strong predictors of turnover. Subsequently, more data mining techniques have been introduced to investigate retaining employees [7, 179, 228]. However, the above studies fail to account for the noise in the data, such as the limited understanding of benefits and cost. To this end, Ajit et al. [4] suggested using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to obtain better performance.\nBesides predicting turnover based on static features, considerable attention is invested in capturing the dynamic factors, especially the evolving neural network-based methods, which have demonstrated significant expressive ability [108]. In this phase, Teng et al. [187, 188] investigated the contagious effect of employee turnover on an individual and organizational level, respectively. Specifically, they developed two LSTM cells to process peers\u2019 turnover sequence and environmental change, as well as a global attention mechanism to evaluate the heterogeneous impact on potential turnover behavior. The experiments conducted on the dataset provided by a high-tech company in China demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed framework, including profile information and turnover records. On this basis, Hang et al. [75] further modeled employee turnover from both internal and external views. For the internal component, they captured the influence of close collaborators and colleagues with similar skills using a graph convolutional network. From the external-market view, they connected employees and external job markets through shared job skills. Finally, both internal and external information is fed into Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and survival analysis for turnover predictions. Job Satisfaction In this phase, another problem also receives considerable attention, namely, how to measure the employee\u2019s job satisfaction, which is inversely related to turnover intention [135]. Traditional approaches in this direction are based on self-reported questionnaire surveys, which are time-consuming and cannot be applied to large organizations. Recently, AI-based technologies have been introduced to automatically analyze job satisfaction from various aspects. Overall, the prediction of job satisfaction can be formulated as a binary classification problem, defined as follows: Definition 3.8 (Job Satisfaction Prediction). Given a set\nof independent variables X , the target is to predict the dependent variable Y , where X characterizes some jobrelated features and Y indicates job satisfaction as a binary variable.\nFor instance, Arambepola [14] explored the influence of job-specific factors on job satisfaction level by combining both the employee\u2019s background data and company-related factors, where several classifiers, including Random Forest,\nLogistic Regression, and SVM, were used for the prediction of the job satisfaction level of software developers. Saha [168] proposed to assess job satisfaction by leveraging large-scale social media, i.e., employees\u2019 Twitter post dataset, where word frequency statistics, lexical analysis, and sentiment analysis have been conducted to extract features from textual data. Accordingly, multiple classifiers, such as SVM and MLP, were used to predict employees\u2019 job satisfaction. In addition to the aforementioned classification models, Mcjames [134] developed a causal inference machine learning approach to identify practical interventions for improving job satisfaction. This approach was based on the TALIS 2018 dataset, which provides a representative sample of school teachers."

            "text": "In the real scenario, abundant talent data can be utilized to construct an organizational network, unveiling the intricate relationships among employees as they form project teams or forge alliances across different groups. An illustration of an organizational network is shown in Figure 8. Without loss of generality, the generalized organization network can be defined as follows: Definition 4.1 (Organizational Network). Organizational\nnetwork is defined as G = (V,E), where V denotes the node set representing employees and departments (or organizations), and E denotes the edge set representing the relationship between nodes, such as the belonging relationship between employees and department, the frequency of communication (e.g., email or instant message) and the reporting lines between employees. Besides, the employee node has a specific profession, which indicates the type of their work (e.g., engineer and product). Meanwhile, each employee and department node has some work-related attributes (e.g., length of service, job level).\nBased on the organizational network, organizational network modeling aims to capture knowledge from this network for supporting talent management-related tasks. Generally, the network embedding techniques are good choices [68, 156] to achieve this goal, which describes the network as low-dimension vectors, and further serves for the downstream applications. For instance, Ye et al. [213] proposed a multiplex attentive network embedding approach for modeling organizational network in a holistic way. In their work, the organizational network is composed of the multiple communication interactions among employees. They generated embedding for employees based on the random walk strategy [156] with k-core and approximated shortest path algorithm. Furthermore, they proposed a relational transition-based approach to represent each department. In this way, the learned representation can be leveraged for several talent management tasks, including employee turnover, performance prediction, and department performance prediction. Besides, Teng et al. [187] exploited\n12\nnetwork fusion technique for organizational turnover prediction. They concentrated on modeling the relationships among organizations. Specifically, they demonstrated the correlation between the topology of organizational network and organizational turnover. To this end, they constructed a turnover similarity network based on the multiple organizational social networks, and took advantage of the GNN to learn comprehensive knowledge from these topological structures, which were further used for organizational turnover prediction. Apart from that, there are also some other applications. For example, Dong et al. [56] studied the problem of cross-group community search on labeled graph, namely Butterfly-Core Community (BCC) search. Specifically, they demonstrated the BCC problem is NP-hard, and proposed an approximated algorithm to solve it. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on a real-world organizational network from Baidu Inc, which can effectively find communities formed by cross-group collaborations given two employees with different positions."

            "heading": "4.1.2 High-potential Talent Identification",
            "text": "High-potential talents (HIPOs) possess leadership abilities, business acumen, and a strong drive for success, making them more likely to emerge as future leaders within organizations when compared to their peers [107]. Proactively identifying and developing HIPOs has always been a major issue in human resource management, it plays significant roles in the execution of organizational strategy and the optimization of organizational structure [177].\nThe traditional methods for HIPOs identification usually rely on subjective selection of HR experts. They primarily focus on evaluating certain talent factors, such as communication skills, teamwork, and self-learning [64, 155]. However, these manually-selected factors may lead to the unintentional bias and inconsistencies [149]. Recently, with the development of ONA, objective data-driven HIPOs identification has become possible. The rationale behind this is that HIPOs usually perform more actively and have\nhigher competencies than their peers to accumulate their social capitals during their daily work [214]. We can detect HIPOs implicitly through social information. Formally, the HIPOs identification problem based on organizational network can be formulated as: Definition 4.2 (HIPOs Identification Problem). Given a\nnew employee v, who joined the company in the t-th time slice, and a set of organizational network G = {Gt, Gt+1, ...Gt+k}, where Gt represents organizational network of time slice t. The objective is to develop a model f(v,G) = y to predict whether v is a HIPO (i.e., y = 1) or not (i.e., y = 0).\nTo solve this problem, Ye et al. [214] proposed a neural network-based dynamic social profiling approach for quantitative identification of HIPOs, which focuses on modeling the dynamics of employees\u2019 behaviors within the organizational network. In particular, they applied GCN and social centrality analysis to extract both local and global information in the organizational network as social profiles for each employee. Then they adopt LSTM with a global attention mechanism to capture the profile dynamics of employees during their early careers. Finally, they evaluated their model on real-world talent data, which clearly validates the effectiveness and interpretability of the proposed model."

            "text": "An organizational structure defines how activities such as task allocation, coordination, and supervision are directed\n13\ntoward the achievement of organizational aims [159]. Considering the availability of data, existing AI-related research has largely explored the formation and optimization of organizations (e.g., teams) under certain goals. Team Formation. Given a project, team formation aims to discover a team of experts that collectively cover all the required skills, as shown in Figure 9. Whereas it is proven to be NP-hard [102], this requirement still needs to be solved in many real-world scenarios, such as team discovery in a social network, which contains professionals who provide specialized skills or services. For instance, Kargar et al. [96] proposed a method to find the object team with minimal communication cost as well as personnel cost of the project. Specifically, they used a graph to model a social network where nodes represent experts and formulate the task as a constrained bi-criteria optimization problem. Since it is proved that the problem of minimizing the combined cost function is still NP-hard, the authors efficiently solve the problem with an approximation algorithm and three heuristic algorithms in polynomial time. Later, Zihayat et al. [233] took both communication cost and experts\u2019 authority into account and proposed greedy algorithms to solve the optimization problem. Since these team formation algorithms are based on very different criteria and performance metrics, Wang et al. [195] implemented these algorithms using a common platform and evaluated their performance with several real datasets. However, these studies have limitations in terms of scalability and fail to effectively manage the dynamic nature of expert networks. To this end, instead of searching over the graph representation of the expert network, Hamidi et al. [74] searched for variational distributions of experts and skills in the context of a team. To be specific, they employed a variational Bayesian neural network to form the optimal team, contributing to a better performance than prior state-of-the-art. Another scene that draws wide attention is the fast-growing Online Labor Marketplaces, which provide a sharp decrease in communication costs. For example, Liu et al. [123] first implemented team formation in crowdsourcing markets with consideration of the impact of teamwork. The study designs a mechanism that combines the greedy selection rule and a special payment scheme, obtaining various desirable properties, such as efficiency, profitability, and truthfulness. In addition, Barnabo et al. [20] considered the fairness of algorithms related to these online marketplaces. They formalized the Fair Team Formation as the problem of finding the cheapest team that can complete the task and, at the same time, that counts the same number of people from two not overlapping classes. Consequently, four algorithms are designed to solve the problem and experiment on real-world\ndata to confirm their effectiveness. Yet, most of the works focus on the offline version of the team formation problem, i.e., the tasks to be completed are a-priori known. To this end, Anagnostopoulos et al. [12] implemented the problem of online cost minimization, where the goal is to minimize the overall cost (paid on hiring, outsourcing, and salary costs) of maintaining a team that can complete the arriving tasks. Moreover, the study considers a more complex case of outsourcing, i.e., hiring, firing, and outsourcing decisions can be taken by an online algorithm leading to cost savings with respect to alternatives. Team Optimization. Two key problems within the scope of team optimization are team member replacement and team expansion, as illustrated in Figure 10. Specifically, team member replacement is put forward first by [112], which aims to find a good candidate to best replace a team member who becomes unavailable to perform the task. To tackle this problem, they introduced the concept of graph kernels that takes into account the interaction of both skill and structure matching requirements. Furthermore, the study proposes a series of effective and scalable algorithms for this problem. Later in [115], the authors further took the synergy between skill similarity and structural similarity into consideration, instead of considering the two aspects independently. In addition, some effort has been paid on team expansion. Zhao et al. [227] formally defined the problem in collaborative environments and proposed a neural networkbased approach, considering three important factors (team task, existing team members, and candidate team member) as well as their interactions simultaneously. However, most works on team optimization treat teams as a static system and recommend a single action to optimize a short-term objective. To this end, Zhou et al. [230] proposed a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to continuously learn and updated its team optimization strategy by incorporating both skill similarity and structural consistency."

In fact, P-O fit has been widely recognized as an effective indicator of proactive talent management, and it has a significant impact on outcomes such as work attitudes, turnover intentions, and job performance [103]. In the domain of organizational behavior, most studies measure P-O fit based on the similarity between organizational profile and employees\u2019 profile.\n14\nFigure 11(a) presents the classical P-O fit modeling process. At first, experts collect information with questionnaires to extract employee and organization profiles and manually design metrics. Then, the statistical methods are applied to measure the congruence between an employee and an organization as P-O fit score. However, this process is laborintensive and subjective, which is difficult to apply to realworld applications. To this end, AI-driven techniques are proposed to automatically extract the profiles and model P-O fit in a dynamic, quantitative, and objective manner. Formally, the P-O fit problem is defined as follows: Definition 4.3 (P-O Fit Problem). Given a sequence of time\nperiods, each associated with an organization network Gt = (V,Et), where the nodes V are employees and links Et indicate their relationships (e.g., reporting relationship) in the time period t. Each node vi has a feature vector xti, representing their traits and behaviors in the t-th time period. The target of Person-Organization Fit is to learn to model the compatibility of each node on the tree with their local environment, seize their dynamic nature and patterns, and accordingly predict relevant talent outcomes y.\nTo solve this problem, Sun et al. [183] proposed a new PO fit modeling process based on AI technology, as shown in Figure 11(b). Specifically, they first extracted features automatically from collected employees\u2019 in-firm data and generated person profiles by dimension reduction on these features. Then, they exploited the organization profile by combining the organization\u2019s structure with the profiles of the employees and extracted a unique environment profile for each employee based on their corresponding positions. Finally, they applied a deep neural network to achieve a more complicated mapping from person and environment profiles to a P-O fit representation. To capture the dynamic nature of P-O fit and its consequent impact, they exploited an adapted Recurrent Neural Network with an attention mechanism to model the temporal information of P-O fit. Later, in [185], Sun et al. further proposed the attentional features extraction layers that can distinguish individualized relation-level and individual-level influence differences for different nodes on the organizational tree. This largely enhanced the performance of person-organization compatibility modeling and improved the interpretability."

Traditional JTB mainly relies on manual market surveys, which are expensive and labor-intensive. Recently, the popularity of online professional networks helps to accumulate massive career records, which provides the opportunity for a data-driven solution. Formally, JTB can be defined as follows: Definition 4.4 (Job Title Benchmarking Problem). JTB is\na process that matches job titles with similar expertise levels across various companies. Formally, given two job title-company pairs, i.e., (titlei, companyi) and (titlej , companyj), the objective is to determine whether the given pairs are on the same level.\nTo handle this problem, Zhang et al. [219] proposed to construct a Job-Graph by extracting information from largescale career trajectory data, where nodes represent job titles affiliated with the specific companies and edges represent the numbers of transitions between job titles. They redefined JTB as a link prediction task on the Job-Graph by assuming that the benchmarked job title pairs should have a strong correlation with the link. Along this line, they proposed a collective multi-view representation learning model to represent job titles from multiple views, including graph topology view, semantic view, job transition balance view, and job transition duration view. Subsequently, they devised a fusion strategy to generate a unified representation from multi-view representation. Finally, they leveraged the similarity between these representations as an indicator for job title benchmarking."

Traditional approaches for JSB mainly rely on the experience from domain experts and market surveys provided by third-party consulting companies or governmental organizations [92, 157]. However, fast-developing technology and industrial structure lead to changes in positions and job requirements, making it difficult to conduct salary benchmarking in a timely manner in dynamic scenarios.\nIn recent years, the prevalence of emerging online recruiting services, such as Indeed and Lagou, has provided\n15\nthe opportunity to accumulate vast amounts of job-related data from a wide range of companies, enabling a new paradigm of compensation benchmarking in a data-driven manner. Formally, the job salary benchmarking problem can be formulated as follows: Definition 4.5 (Job Salary Benchmarking Problem). Suppose\nthere are job positions i = 1, 2, 3..., I and locationspecific company j = 1, 2, 3, ..., J . Each position i has some features, e.g., bag-of-words, and each locationspecific company j can be described as a list of features, e.g., location and industry. Given a combination of position and company (i, j), the objective is to predict its salary s\u0302ij so that the similarity between s\u0302ij and real observation sij is maximized.\nTo address this problem, one straightforward procedure is to construct a job-company salary matrix, where each entry indicates the corresponding salary of a given jobcompany pair. And the JSB problem can be regarded as a matrix completion task. Generally, matrix factorization (MF) is a widely-used method for handling this task. It aims to factorize an incomplete job-company salary matrix into two lower rank latent matrices, and use their dot product for estimating the possible salary of the missing entries. However, the intuitive method is too general to meet the various special needs of C&B professionals. To this end, Meng et al. [137] proposed an expanded salary matrix by expanding the original job-company salary matrix with locations and time information for the fine-grained salary benchmarking. And then they designed a matrix factorization based model for predicting the missing salary information in the expanded salary matrix by integrating multiple confounding factors, including company similarity, job similarity, and spatial-temporal similarity. Further, Meng et al. [136] designed a nonparametric Dirichlet-process-based latent factor model for JSB, which learns representation for companies and positions to alleviate the data deficiency problem. By conducting experiments on two large-scale real-world data, the effectiveness and interpretability of the proposed model have been proved."

These methods make it challenging to uncover the complex associations among multi-source data and the hidden patterns in massive data. The efficiency is also limited by manual analysis. Moreover, some studies that rely on online collected data typically employ causal inference or statistical analysis methods. For example, Jackson et al. [88] deployed psychometric measures with internet surveys to infer the reasons behind talent flow. Hershbein et al. [81] analyzed concentration in labor markets from vacancy and employment data. Hershbein et al. [80] deployed various statistical approaches to analyze the different skill requirements of job postings in different economic situations.\nRecently, the prevalence of Online Professional Networks (OPNs) and online recruitment websites has facilitated the accumulation of a large number of job reviews, company reviews, digital resumes, and job postings. These sources contain a wealth of intricate and diverse information about the labor market, including talent flow, talent demand, market trends, job skills, company branding, and more. These extensive datasets provide novel perspectives and opportunities for conducting a more fine-grained analysis of the labor market at a large scale.

Such efforts are crucial for maximizing the potential of human resources and enhancing organizational productivity. Indeed, we can leverage knowledge graph-related technologies [90] to construct the talent\u2019s knowledge base and achieve efficient knowledge management. Moreover, we can transform the scenarios in talent development, such as knowledge learning and collaboration, into different recommendation scenarios and utilize recommendation algorithms to solve these problems. Recently, Wang et al. developed a personalized online courses recommendation system based on the employees\u2019 current profiling [193, 194]. However, there is still a lack of an algorithm that can recommend heterogeneous knowledge. The existing algorithms are only from the individual perspective and have not been analyzed from the organizational aspect, such as the organizational knowledge diversity or competitiveness."

            "text": "AI technology has been effectively applied in labor market analytics [220]. However, those approaches mainly focus on the perspective of global market analysis and have not explored how the changing environment of the labor market affects internal talent management or organization management. In fact, combining macro and micro data in talent analytics is a vital research direction [85]. With the recent accumulation of internal and external data, there exists an exceptional opportunity to implement market-oriented\ntalent analytics. For instance, Hang et al. leveraged the job posting data to capture the potential popularity of employees in external markets specific to skills and further achieve more accurate employee turnover prediction based on the market trend [75]. Moreover, the rapid development of AI technologies provides an excellent technical foundation for this direction. We can unitize multi-task learning [225] to jointly learn both macro and micro talent analytics-related tasks. Heterogeneous graph learning [75, 218] can help us effectively model the correlation of macro and micro data."

            "text": "In our survey, we reviewed the recent advance in AI techniques for talent analytics in HRM from three perspectives, including talent management, organization management, and labor market analysis. Indeed, the culture of the organizations is one of the most important means of addressing the never-ending quest to maintain organizational viability and effectiveness [69]. Generally, the culture mainly contains three aspects: Mission, Vision, and Values (MVVs), which can help the employees understand what is encouraged, discouraged, accepted, or rejected within an organization, and facilitate the organization to thrive with the shared purpose. Recently, the availability of large-scale data on the whole life cycle of talents and organizations is gradually demonstrating extraordinary opportunities for leaders in culture management. For instance, culture and leadership are inextricably linked and the best team leaders can effectively shape the culture [69]. Some researchers [105] discussed how ML techniques can be used to inform predictive and causal models of leadership effects. Accordingly, they further provided a step-by-step guide on designing studies that combine field experiments with ML applications to establish causal relationships with maximal predictive power. Meanwhile, several studies analyze the leadership styles with the data mining algorithms, demonstrating that the different leadership styles significantly influence leadership outcomes [3]. Moreover, there are some researchers who tried to leverage text mining to analyze the organizational culture. For instance, Schmiedel et al. leveraged the online company reviews data and topic model to explore the employee\u2019s perception of corporate culture [170]. Li et al. [110] applied a topic model to obtain firm-level measures of exposure and response related to COVID-19 for many U.S. firms. In detail, they deployed Correlated Topic Model (CTM) [166], which is similar to Latent Dirichlet Allocation\n21\n(LDA), with 35 topics to discover the correlation between COVID-19 and the company-level measure. The results show that despite the large negative impact of COVID-19 on their operations, firms with a strong corporate culture can outperform their peers without a strong culture. As a famous saying goes, \u201cCulture eats strategy for breakfast\u201d, employing AI technologies in organizational culture management will become one of the most critical research directions in the near future, because it can help managers realize cultural management scientifically."

However, they still raise various concerns about how to ensure that AI technologies adhere to well-defined ethical guidelines regarding fundamental values. Recently, some researchers have made from efforts two perspectives, i.e., fairness and explainability."

            "heading": "6.5.1 Fairness",
            "text": "Generally, the fairness of talent analytics needs to be considered frequently, because management decisions affect employees\u2019 lives and are directly related to the organization\u2019s values. Although AI technologies have achieved various successes in talent analytics, there is growing concern that such approaches may bring issues of unfairness to people and organizations, as evidenced by some recent reports [27, 51, 106]. For instance, Amazon scraps its AIbased recruitment system due to its discriminatory impact against women [51].\nRecently, there are several studies focusing on the fairness of talent management with AI technologies from different perspectives. For instance, Qin et al. [163] verified that when involving the sensitive features, such as gender, age, etc., into the person-job fit model, the model without special design will easily learn the bias from the original data. Intuitively, we can solve this problem by removing sensitive features, also regarded as one of the pre-processing methods for imposing fairness [49]. However, a large amount of unstructured data already contains sensitive features, such as audio and video data in the interview process. The model can easily infer the potentially sensitive attributes of data, which may still cause the bias of AI algorithms [53]. In [154], Pena et al. focused on the multimodal system to predict recruitable from the rich information in the candidate\u2019s resume, i.e., image and structured features. The authors first demonstrated that the deep learning model could reproduce the biases from the training data, even without the sensitive features. They further introduced incorporating an adversarial regularizer [141] that can remove the sensitive information from unstructured features, so that to achieve the fairness of the algorithm. Similarly, Yan et al. both leveraged data balancing and adversarial learning to mitigate bias in the multimodal personality assessment [207]. Moreover, there exist several open-source tools, such as AIF360 [21], FairML [2], Themis-ML [19], that can facilitate systematic bias checks and embed fairness in the AI algorithms [142]. In addition, AI technologies can also help to reduce human bias in different talent management scenarios. For instance,\nAI technologies have been applied to detect the potentially problematic words in the job posting that lead to bias or even legal risks and further assist employers in writing inclusive job descriptions [130]. Therefore, ensuring the fairness of AI algorithms is an important research direction that has received more and more attention in talent analytics."

            "heading": "6.5.2 Explainability",
            "text": "Recently, there has been an increasing concern among employees and managers regarding the decisions made by black-box AI algorithms. Questions arise regarding the basis of these decisions, understanding the factors behind algorithmic success or failure, and determining how to rectify any errors that occur. Therefore, the research interests in increasing the transparency of AI-based automated decisionmaking in talent management are re-emerging [86, 224]. For instance, Qin et al. proposed to leverage the attention mechanisms to explain the matching degree between the content of job posting and resume [162]. Zhang et al. further introduced the hierarchical attention and collaborative attention mechanisms to increase the person-job fit model explainability both at the structured and unstructured information level [226]. Upadhyay et al. leveraged the knowledge graph and name entity recognition technologies to generate the understandable textual job recommendation explanation [189]. In [98], Kaya et al. focused on constructing an end-to-end system for explainable automatic job candidate screening from video resumes. The authors extracted the audio, face, and scene features and leveraged the decision trees to both predict whether the candidates will be invited to the interview and explain the decisions by using binarization with a threshold. Liem et al. further handled the job candidate screening problem from an interdisciplinary viewpoint of psychologists and machine learning scientists [116]. Moreover, Juvitayapun et al. used the tree-based model to calculate different features\u2019 importance to enhance the explainability of AI-based turn-over prediction [93].\nHowever, the current approaches only stay from the perspective of AI model design and fail to consider whether employees or managers can easily comprehend and grasp the explanatory conclusions provided by the model. Indeed, visual analytics is an inherent way to help people who are inexperienced in AI understand the data and model [10, 46]. Therefore, combining visual analysis and explainable AI and building an intelligent talent management system is a valuable research direction. Furthermore, the vast amount of interaction data generated by users can assist us in iterating the model from various perspectives, such as rectifying errors in automated decision-making and enhancing the efficiency of visual information presentation."
