"The treatment of NDDs is still a major concern and therapeutic agents that tackle the pathophysiology of the disease are required for effective treatment. In the present review, we presented evidence from a few studies that confirm the antioxidative and neuroprotective role of picein in addition to its lack of cytotoxicity. Therefore, this plant-derived natural biomolecule may be a safe and effective agent for the treatment of NDDs. Nonetheless, the number of studies is limited in this regard and more studies are required on animals to prove these properties and propose this agent as a novel therapeutic agent."
