1. **Investigate the binding affinities of the ligand-receptor complexes using more advanced computational methods.** The current study used molecular dynamics simulations and QM calculations to estimate the binding affinities of the ligand-receptor complexes. However, more advanced computational methods, such as free energy perturbation or steered molecular dynamics, could provide more accurate estimates of the binding affinities.


2. **Study the effects of different mutations in the D2 dopamine receptor on the binding of the ligands.** The current study focused on the wild-type D2 dopamine receptor. However, mutations in the D2 dopamine receptor are known to occur in a variety of diseases, such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Investigating the effects of these mutations on the binding of the ligands could provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of these diseases.


3. **Explore the effects of different solvents on the binding of the ligands to the D2 dopamine receptor.** The current study was conducted in water. However, the D2 dopamine receptor is located in a lipid bilayer membrane. Investigating the effects of different solvents, such as lipids or detergents, on the binding of the ligands could provide insights into the role of the membrane environment in ligand binding.


4. **Investigate the effects of different temperatures on the binding of the ligands to the D2 dopamine receptor.** The current study was conducted at room temperature. However, the temperature of the body can vary significantly, for example, during fever or hypothermia. Investigating the effects of different temperatures on the binding of the ligands could provide insights into the stability of the ligand-receptor complexes under different physiological conditions.


5. **Study the effects of different ligands on the signaling pathways of the D2 dopamine receptor.** The current study focused on the binding of the ligands to the D2 dopamine receptor. However, the binding of ligands to the D2 dopamine receptor can also lead to changes in the signaling pathways of the receptor. Investigating the effects of different ligands on the signaling pathways of the D2 dopamine receptor could provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of the receptor's function.
