Exploration of CBEO's Components Beyond EZ: While the study focused on (Z)-2-lachnophyllum ester (EZ) as the major component of Conyza bonariensis essential oil (CBEO), future research could delve into the biological activities and potential therapeutic benefits of other minor constituents identified in CBEO. This exploration may uncover additional mechanisms of action and synergistic effects that could enhance its anticancer properties.

In Vivo Anticancer Efficacy of CBEO: Building on the in vitro findings, an important next step is to assess the anticancer efficacy and safety of CBEO in animal models of melanoma. This could involve evaluating the impact of CBEO on tumor growth, metastasis, and survival rates, alongside its potential side effects and toxicity profile, to better understand its therapeutic potential and limitations.

Mechanistic Studies on CBEO-Induced Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Arrest: Although the study provides initial insights into the mechanisms by which CBEO induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, detailed mechanistic studies are needed to fully elucidate the pathways involved. This could include investigating the role of specific apoptotic markers, detailed phase-specific cell cycle analyses, and the involvement of other signaling molecules not covered in the initial study.

Combination Therapies Involving CBEO: Considering the complex nature of cancer and the issue of drug resistance, exploring the potential of CBEO as part of combination therapy with existing chemotherapeutic agents could be valuable. Research could focus on identifying synergistic interactions that enhance efficacy, reduce side effects, or overcome resistance to conventional treatments.

Identification and Synthesis of Active CBEO Analogs: Given the promising anticancer properties of CBEO, there is a potential for the identification and synthesis of analogs of its active components, such as EZ, that may have improved bioactivity, stability, or pharmacokinetic properties. This could lead to the development of novel anticancer agents with enhanced therapeutic potential.
