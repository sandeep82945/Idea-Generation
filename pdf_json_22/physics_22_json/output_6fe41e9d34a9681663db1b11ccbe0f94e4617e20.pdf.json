By means of reinforcement learning algorithms, we showed that swimmers indeed learn nearly optimal strategies just by building experience, even in difficult situations when, in the absence of control, they would end up being trapped by flow structures. Some of the results have been affected by an erroneous implementation of the rotational noise term, ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2DR p\n\u03be in Eq. (2) in this Letter, defining the evolution of the swimming direction. The general qualitative conclusions of this Letter remain the same, while some minor quantitative aspects shown in\nFigs. 1\u20133 need to be amended. Below, we report the new versions of Figs. 1\u20133, obtained with a correct implementation of the rotational noise with amplitude fixed toDR \u00bc 0.0001. Notice that the only minor qualitative difference with what was reported in this Letter is in the right panel in the new Fig. 3, where we do not observe, for optimal policies, actions connected to inefficient downwardswimming strategies. All other conclusions, connected to the efficiency in outperforming naive gravitactic policies shown in Figs. 1 and 3 (left panel) as well as the robustness of the learning protocol shown in Fig. 2, remain unaltered.\n0031-9007=22=128(20)=209901(2) 209901-1 \u00a9 2022 American Physical Society\nWe acknowledge Dai Haotian for pointing out the error in the rotational noise.\n209901-2"
