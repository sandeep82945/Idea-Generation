 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a similar comparison of DCE and PTT methods in a patient population rather than the general public to see if results are consistent. The authors note their sample may not generalize to all populations. 

2. Test different experimental designs and statistical models for the PTT to develop best practice recommendations, since they currently exist for DCE but not PTT.

3. Explore using a combination of DCE and PTT methods in one study to leverage the strengths of each approach. For example, use DCE for multiple attributes and PTT for individual-level heterogeneity.

4. Evaluate how well DCE and PTT elicit true maximum acceptable risk compared to observing real-world behavior and choices. This could inform validity.

5. Apply DCE and PTT to additional disease areas beyond rheumatoid arthritis to build evidence across clinical contexts. The methods should be robust.
