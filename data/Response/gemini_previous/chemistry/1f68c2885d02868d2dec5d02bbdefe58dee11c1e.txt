1. **Investigate the potential of ANP0903 liposomes in combination with other anticancer agents.** The study demonstrated the efficacy of ANP0903 liposomes as a single agent in vitro. However, it would be interesting to explore whether the combination of ANP0903 liposomes with other anticancer drugs could lead to synergistic or additive effects. This could potentially improve the overall efficacy of treatment and reduce the risk of drug resistance.


2. **Evaluate the in vivo efficacy of ANP0903 liposomes in animal models of liver cancer.** The study only evaluated the efficacy of ANP0903 liposomes in vitro. To further validate the potential of this formulation, it is important to assess its efficacy in vivo using animal models of liver cancer. This would provide more robust evidence of the antitumor activity of ANP0903 liposomes and help determine their potential for clinical translation.


3. **Investigate the mechanisms of proteasome inhibition by ANP0903.** The study suggested that ANP0903 may inhibit the proteasome, leading to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and induction of apoptosis. However, the exact mechanism of proteasome inhibition by ANP0903 is not fully understood. Further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular targets and pathways involved in this process. This knowledge could aid in the development of more potent and selective proteasome inhibitors for cancer therapy.


4. **Explore the potential of ANP0903 liposomes for targeted delivery to liver cancer cells.** The study used non-targeted PEGylated liposomes for the delivery of ANP0903. However, it would be interesting to investigate the use of targeted liposomes that can specifically deliver ANP0903 to liver cancer cells. This could potentially improve the efficacy of treatment and reduce systemic toxicity.


5. **Investigate the potential of ANP0903 liposomes for the treatment of other types of cancer.** The study focused on the efficacy of ANP0903 liposomes in liver cancer. However, it would be interesting to explore whether this formulation could also be effective in treating other types of cancer. This could expand the potential clinical applications of ANP0903 liposomes and provide a new treatment option for patients with various types of cancer.
