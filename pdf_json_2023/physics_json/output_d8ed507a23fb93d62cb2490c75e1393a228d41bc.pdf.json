    "abstractText": "Modification of DNA aptamers is aimed at increasing their thermodynamic stability, and improving affinity and resistance to biodegradation. G-quadruplex DNA aptamers are a family of affinity ligands that form non-canonical DNA assemblies based on a G-tetrads stack. Modification of the quadruplex core is challenging since it can cause complete loss of affinity of the aptamer. On the other hand, increased thermodynamic stability could be a worthy reward. In the current paper, we developed new threeand four-layer modified analogues of the thrombin binding aptamer with high thermal stability, which retain anticoagulant activity against alpha-thrombin. In the modified aptamers, one or two G-tetrads contained non-natural anti-preferred alpha-deoxyguanosines at specific positions. The use of this nucleotide analogue made it possible to control the topology of the modified structures. Due to the presence of non-natural tetrads, we observed some decrease in the anticoagulant activity of the modified aptamers compared to the natural prototype. This negative effect was completely compensated by conjugation of the aptamers with optimized tripeptide sequences.",

            "text": "In recent years, nucleic acid aptamers have attracted increasing attention due to their high potential in molecular therapy and diagnostics. Aptamers are single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules that specifically bind with high affinity to their targets, which may range from small molecules such as adenosine monophosphate to large proteins. Typically, aptamers are evolved in an experimental procedure called SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands via exponential enrichment). This consists of repeated rounds of enrichment of a large DNA or RNA library through competitive binding to a target. The structural basis for the high specificity and affinity of aptamer ligands lies in their ability to form a unique three-dimensional structure that perfectly fits the target. While some aptamers adopt their active conformation primarily through an induced fit mechanism [1,2], others can form the core of their specific spatial structure independently of targets. In particular, the 15-mer DNA aptamer that binds and inhibits alpha-thrombin forms a well-characterized anti-parallel G-quadruplex structure [3,4]. The thrombin binding aptamer (TBA) is a convenient model for studying aptamer\u2013protein interactions, since detailed structural information about the aptamer itself and its complex with the protein is available [5\u20139]. This circumstance has contributed to numerous attempts to rationally design optimized TBA variants with increased thermodynamic stability, improved affinity, or increased\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 8406. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24098406 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 8406 2 of 13\nresistance to biodegradation. To date, a large number of TBA-like structures have been proposed, which differ widely in affinity, stability, and resistance to biodegradation [3]. Although multiple strategies have been employed to improve thermodynamic stability or affinity of TBA, adding natural G-quartet planes to an anti-parallel G-quadruplex has never been reported to be a successful approach. It has recently been demonstrated [10] that TBA derivatives with one or two additional G-tetrads do not exhibit anticoagulant properties. A three-layer TBA analogue appeared to adopt a parallel configuration, while a four-layer analogue retained an anti-parallel fold [10,11]. Despite failures with natural three-layer structures, non-natural analogues proved to be more promising. An example of a three-layer TBA analogue with non-natural alpha-deoxyguanosines in two of its three G-tetrads was reported recently by our group [12] (model 1 in Figure 1). An anti-parallel modified G-quadruplex was characterized by notably enhanced thermal stability and retained its anticoagulant properties, which, however, decreased with respect to TBA. Importantly, due to the presence of two G-tetrads with the same polarity, the modified aptamer showed a hybrid-type CD spectrum in both K+ and Na+ containing buffers. Since alpha-anomers of nucleosides are thought to preferably adopt anticonformation [13\u201316], alpha-deoxyguanosine functions as a syn-deoxyguanosine mimetic in modified G-quadruplexes (Figure S1). Similar to other nucleoside analogues with a preferred syn- or anti-conformation [17\u201319], alpha-deoxyguanosine may be used in the design of new G-quadruplex structures with predefined topology and G-quartet polarities.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 13\ntailed structural information about the aptamer itself and its complex with the protein is available [5\u20139]. This circumstance has contributed to numerous attempts to rationally design optimized TBA variants with increased thermodynamic stability, improved affinity, or increased resistance to biodegradation. To date, a large number of TBA-like structures have been proposed, which differ widely in affinity, stability, and resistance to biodegradation [3]. Although multiple strategies have been employed to improve thermodynamic stability or affinity of TBA, adding natural G-quartet planes to an anti-parallel G-quadruplex has never been reported to be a successful approach. It has recently been demonstrated [10] that TBA derivatives with one or two additional G-tetrads do not exhibit anticoagulant properties. A three-layer TBA analogue appeared to adopt a parallel configuration, while a four-layer analogue retained an anti-parallel fold [10,11]. Despite failures with natural three-layer structures, non-natural analogues proved to be more promising. An example of a three-layer TBA analogue with non-natural alpha-deoxyguanosines in two of its three G-tetrads was reported recently by our group [12] (model 1 in Figure 1). An anti-parallel modified G-quadruplex was characterized by notably enhanced thermal stability and retained its anticoagulant properties, which, however, decreased with respect to TBA. Importantly, due to the presence of two G-tetrads with the same polarity, the modified aptamer showed a hybrid-type CD spectrum in both K+ and Na+ containing buffers. Since alpha-anomers of nucleosides are thought to preferably adopt anti-conformation [13\u201316], alpha-deoxyguanosine functions as a syn-deoxyguanosine mimetic in modified G-quadruplexes (Figure S1). Similar to other nucleoside analogu s with a preferred syn- or anti-conf rmatio [17\u201319], alpha-d oxygua osine may be used i the design of new G-quadruplex struct r s with predefi ed topology nd G-quartet polarities.\nFigure 1.

Furthermore, we show that the antithrombotic activity of modified G-quadruplexes can be considerably increased by regioselective conjugation with optimized tripeptide sequences, as recently described [20].\nInt.

            "text": "In our recent study [12], we hypothesized that a TBA\u2013thrombin recognition interface is highly sensitive to a proximal G-quartet configuration. Therefore, in the design of new three- and four-layer TBA analogues we tried to preserve a native TBA configuration at the aptamer\u2013protein interface (Figure 1 and Table 1). To this end, we left intact the two G-tetrads proximal to the protein (Q1 and Q2) in models 2\u20135, thus reproducing the architecture of unmodified TBA. One or two non-natural G-tetrads were added to TBA in four new alphathrombin aptamer derivatives (2, 3, 4, and 5), as shown in Figure 1. Based on the published results [13\u201316], the conformations of non-natural alpha-deoxyguanosines were presumed as anti. In terms of the syn\u2013anti isomerism of natural deoxyguanosine, modification of the G-quartet with anti-alpha-deoxyguanosine at a certain position is equivalent to the syn configuration of the unmodified nucleoside at that particular position. Following this rule, we designed modified G-quartets to either retain or reverse the polarity of an adjacent natural quartet. In this way, in TBA analogues 2 and 4 the modified G-tetrads retained the polarity of the natural quartet Q2. However, models 3 and 5 contained modified tetrads opposite in polarity to the natural G-tetrad Q2. In the four-layer modified TBA analogues 4 and 5, two non-natural G-tetrads (Q3 and Q4) were configured to have identical G-quartet polarities by placing two consecutive alpha-deoxyguanosine modifications in the respective strands. TBA analogue 1 represents a variant of the previously studied three-layer model [12], which is characterized by notably improved thermal stability and preserved anticoagulant properties. All TBA analogues in the current study were capped with a tetraethyleneglycol linker and a propargyl functionality at their 3\u2032 end to make possible fluorescent labeling with Cy5 dye via click chemistry (Figure S2).\n1 g = \u03b1-dG; all oligonucleotides have 3\u2032 tetraethylene glycol and propargyl tag (Figure S1). 2 Tm values are determined from first-derivative plots; \u2206Tm = \u00b10.5 \u25e6C; 3 transition was not detected up to 95 \u25e6C; 4 only the beginning of the transition was observed. Tm values of around 20 and 50 \u25e6C have been reported in the literature for unmodified TBA in 100 mM Na+ or K+ buffers, respectively [3]."

Thermal Stability and Folding We further evaluated the thermal stability of G-quadruplex structures formed by modified oligonucleotides in Na+ and K+ buffer solutions. In our previous study, we found that in 100 mM KCl a variant of model 1 forms an extremely stable structure [12] that does not unfold up to 95 \u00b0C. In 100 mM NaCl, we found a Tm value of 70.4 \u00b0C. These findings were confirmed in the present study. Even in a 10 mM K+ buffer, we could not observe a transition (Table 1) for analogue 1. The stability of the TBA analogues showed strong correlation with their design. Analogues with identical polarities of adjacent natural and modified tetrads Q2 and Q3 (analogues 2 and 4) turned out to be highly stable. Melting of analogue 4 could only be observed in 10 mM NaCl, and the Tm value was as high as 87.8 \u00b0C. It was found that the G-quadruplex structure formed by aptamer 4 could not be denatured in 7 M urea at room temperature. Gel images showing migration of analogue 4 during electrophoresis in denaturing polyacrylamide gel at different temperatures are given in Figure S3. However, analogues 3 and 5 with opposite polarities of neighboring modified and natural tetrads were characterized by invariably lower Tm values as compared to variants 2 and 4, respectively. This fact provides evidence that a 5\u2032-(anti-dG)-(anti-alpha-dG)-3\u2032 step in the G-quadruplex strand induces considerable loss of thermodynamic stability, which can be associated with unfavorable stacking conditions between the modified and unmodified G-quartets Q3 and Q2 in analogues 3 and 5. Interestingly, the presence of two adjacent modified G-tetrads with identical polarity in analogues 1, 4, and 5 was highly beneficial in terms of thermodynamic stability as compared to the structures with a single modified tetrad (2 and 3), regardless of the type of contact between the modified and unmodified G-quartets. Presumably, three- or four-layer stacks of modified tetrads with the same polarity as in 1, 4, and 5 can form highly stable G-quadruplex structures. TBA analogue 2 was the only Q-quadruplex structure that exhibited a two-phase transition in K+ containing buffers (Figure 3). This effect was not observed with Na+ buffers. Minor low-temperature transitions in 100 and 10 mM K+ buffers were observed at 55 and 39 \u00b0C, respectively. It is worth noting that the CD spectra of aptamer 2 in 100 mM K+ buffer at 20 and 65 \u00b0C showed similar patterns (Figure S4), thus providing evidence that the low-temperature transition is not associated with conformational rearrangements.\ni 2. l sis of the binding of Cy5-labeled aptamers to alpha-thrombin by el ctrophoresi in a\n12% polyacrylamide gel at 10 \u25e6C in K+ containing buffer.

We used both Cy5-labeled and unlabeled aptamer variants. With one exception, all unlabeled modified G-quadruplexes migrated as a major band in the monomer zone. Aptamer 3 appeared as a major band with a notably lower mobility, which can presumably be associated with the formation of a dimer, bimolecular structure, or unfolded form. The presence of the Cy5 dye at the 3\u2032 end affected the migration patterns of analogues 3 and 5. The former produced smeared bands above the monomer zone. This pattern is consistent with partial unfolding and correlates with the relatively low stability of the G-quadruplex structure formed by aptamer 3. Aptamer quadruplex 5 formed two monomer bands, which most likely resulted from Cy5 dye attachment to a specific functional moiety at the 3\u2032 end. Earlier, we observed the formation of two fluorescent products when using the same type of 3\u2032 clickable tag [12]. Thus, the results of gel-shift assay confirmed the monomolecular folding of TBA analogues 1, 2, 4, and 5.

Structural Details of Modified G-Quadruplexes Molecular dynamics provides an accessible tool for evaluating the structural organization of non-canonical DNA scaffolds. We have applied this technique to characterize five non-natural G-quadruplexes. Starting spatial models of non-natural G-quadruplexes were generated using TBA aptamer models from the previously reported PDB structure 1HAO. We used the previously described strategy to build five non-natural G-quadruplex models [21]. Based on literature reports [13\u201316] and the results of CD experiments, anti-conformation for non-natural alpha-deoxyguanosines was set in all models. The results of 80-ns MD simulations showed the conformational stability of the modified structures (Figures S5\u2013S9). It was confirmed that the presence of one or two non-natural G-tetrads in three- and four-layer G-quadruplexes is consistent with a TBA-like anti-parallel architecture. In a series of three-layer G-quadruplexes, variant 2 was identified as the most stable structure by the sum of all contributions to the potential energy (Figure S5). For TBA analogues 4 and 5, we found approximately equal values for the same parameter. The analysis of specific energy contributions (Eq + EVdW) for each of the three or four tetrads of the studied structures appeared to be more informative (Figure 6). In the three-layer models (1, 2, and 3), tetrad stabilities invariably decreased in the following order: Q3 > Q1 > Q2.

A minimal negative effect was observed for analogue 2. Importantly, aptamers 3 and 5, featuring adjacent modified and unmodified G-tetrads with opposite polarity, were the least active in the clotting time test. Nevertheless, the fact that all non-natural variants retained inhibitory activity further supports the design approach based on the use of alpha-guanosine as an anti-biased analogue.\nFigure 7.

Conjugation with the peptide sequence was carried out at residues T4 in analogue and T5 in analogue 4, which are t functional equivalents of T3 in TBA. In the course of the automated oligonucl otide synthesis, these particular positions were modified with an activated pnitrophenyl thymidine derivative [22]. Post-synthetic conjugation with the respective tripeptides was followed by a standard deprotection procedure yielding crude conjugates.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 8406 9 of 13\nDue to the poor resolution of the complex reaction mixture, we used a combination of reversed-phase HPLC and denaturing gel-electrophoresis at different temperatures to purify peptide\u2013aptamer conjugates. The identity of the conjugates was confirmed by MALDI mass spectrometry. Predictably, conjugation of TBA analogues 2 and 4 with GLE and SLE tripeptides induced a considerable increase in anticoagulant activity (Figure 7). The relative t1/2 values referred to TBA were 2.9 \u00b1 0.6, 5.9 \u00b1 0.9, and 4.1 \u00b1 0.8 for 2SLE, 2GLE, and 4GLE, respectively. Interestingly, the enhancement effect induced by the SLE and GLE peptides in analogue 2 was almost identical in magnitude to that of the previously reported conjugates TBA-SLE and TBA-GLE [20]. In the case of variant 4, the effect of the GLE subunit was apparently weakened by distortions at the aptamer\u2013protein interface due to the presence of two modified tetrads Q3 and Q4 in the quadruplex core. To characterize the most advanced conjugate 2GLE in terms of binding affinity, we analyzed the interaction between alpha-thrombin and the Cy5-labeled aptamer using a microscale thermophoresis technique. The dissociation constants for Cy5-labeled 2GLE and TBA were determined at an aptamer concentration of 20 nM in 90 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The aptamer conjugate 2GLE was characterized by improved binding affinity (Kd = 2.7 \u00b1 0.5 nM) compared to unmodified TBA (Kd = 19.5 \u00b1 1.0 nM)."

The arrangement of the loops matched the same in the crystal structure 1HAO. Modified Gquartets were added to the elements of the starting models using SYBYL X v.2.1 (Certara, Princeton, NJ, USA). The new structures were optimized by the SYBYL X and Powell method with the following settings: partial charges and parameters for interatomic interactions were from the Amber7ff02 force field, a nonbonded cut-off distance was set to 8 \u00c5, a distance-dependent dielectric function was applied, the number of iterations was equal to 500, the simplex method was used in the initial optimization, and the energy gradient convergence criterion of 0.05 kcal/mol/\u00c5 was applied. The model stabilities were verified by MD simulations using Amber 20 software [23]. The influence of the solvent was simulated using the OPC3 water model [24]. Rectangular box and periodic boundary conditions were used in the simulation. The space between the aptamer model and the periodic box wall was at least 15 \u00c5. Potassium ions were used to neutralize the negative charge of the DNA backbone and stabilize the quadruplex structure. The parameters needed for interatomic energy calculation were taken from the force fields OL15 [25,26]. At the beginning of computation, the aptamer models were optimized in two stages. First, the location of the solvent molecules was optimized by using 1000 steps\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 8406 11 of 13\n(500 steps of steepest descent followed by 500 steps of conjugate gradient). At this stage, the mobility of all solute atoms was restrained by a force constant of 500 kcal\u00b7mol\u22121\u00b7\u00c5\u22122. In the second stage, the optimization was performed without restrictions using 2500 steps (1000 steps of steepest descent and 1500 steps of conjugate gradient). Then, gradual heating to 300 K was carried out for 20 ps. To avoid spontaneous fluctuations at this point, weak harmonic restraints were applied with a force constant of 10 kcal\u00b7mol\u22121\u00b7\u00c5\u22122 for all atoms other than solvent. The SHAKE algorithm was applied to constrain hydrogen-containing bonds, which allowed the use of a 2 fs time step. Scaling of 1\u20134 nonbonded van der Waals and electrostatic interactions was performed by using the standard Amber values. The cutoff distance for nonbonded interactions was set to 10 \u00c5, and the long-range electrostatics were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald method. MD simulations in the production phase were carried out using constant temperature (T = 300 K) and constant pressure (p = 1 atm) over 80 ns. To control the temperature, a Langevin thermostat was used with a collision frequency of 1 ps\u22121. To estimate the distances between tetrads or particular guanines, the centers of mass of the aromatic rings were used. The plots of geometrical parameters and energy of interaction vs. time were smoothed using the moving average method (span = 5)."

With regard to the whole family of G-quadruplex structures, alpha-deoxyguanosine can be considered in line with other modified or natural nucleotides that regulate assembly of these non-canonical structures through a preferential syn\u2013anti conformation mechanism. The addition of modified tetrads to TBA provides a considerable increase in the thermodynamic stability of the resulting structures. The payoff for this gain is certain distortions in the quadruplex core that affect the aptamer\u2013protein interface. Fortunately, a moderate loss of anticoagulant activity may be completely abrogated by creating an extended recognition interface through conjugation to an optimized tripeptide subunit. Modified aptamer variants 2 and 4 with the GLE peptide subunit have proven to be promising candidates for advanced anticoagulant DNA aptamers.\nSupplementary Materials: The supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi. com/article/10.3390/ijms24098406/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, E.N.T.; methodology, E.N.T., N.A.K., I.V.V. and V.B.T.; investigation, I.V.V., N.A.K., V.B.T., S.A.S. and A.A.S.; data curation, N.A.K., I.V.V., V.B.T. and A.A.S.; validation, I.V.V. and N.A.K.; visualization, V.B.T., I.V.V. and A.A.S.; writing\u2014original draft, E.N.T., I.V.V. and V.B.T.; writing\u2014review and editing, E.N.T.; supervision, E.N.T.
