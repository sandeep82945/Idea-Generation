Enzymatic Production of Specific Lutein Isomers: Investigate the enzymatic pathways responsible for the formation of specific lutein isomers in flowers like Anthemis tinctoria and Helichrysum italicum. This could lead to a better understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying isomer production and potentially enable the bioengineering of plants or microorganisms to produce high yields of specific lutein isomers.

Bioavailability and Health Benefits of Lutein Isomers: Since the paper touches on the bioavailability of cis-isomers being higher than the trans-isomer and suggests that antioxidant activities might be better for Z-isomers, conducting detailed human or animal studies on the bioavailability, metabolism, and specific health benefits of each lutein isomer could provide valuable information for nutritional science and potential therapeutic applications.

Carotenoid Composition and Its Impact on Flower Coloration: Explore the relationship between the specific carotenoid compositions, including the presence of lutein isomers, and the resulting coloration of flower petals. This research could contribute to plant biology by elucidating the biochemical pathways of pigment formation and their genetic regulation, as well as to agriculture and horticulture through the development of flowers with novel and desirable colors.

Ecological Roles of Lutein Isomers in Plants: Investigate the ecological significance of lutein and its isomers in plants, focusing on how these compounds affect plant interactions with pollinators, herbivores, and pathogens. Understanding the ecological roles of these carotenoids could reveal new insights into plant defense mechanisms and pollination strategies.

Technological Advances in Carotenoid Isolation and Analysis: Develop and refine analytical techniques for the separation, identification, and quantification of lutein isomers and other carotenoids in plant tissues. Improvements in methodologies such as HPLC, NMR, and mass spectrometry could enhance the efficiency and accuracy of carotenoid analysis, benefiting research across multiple fields, including pharmacognosy, food science, and plant biology.
