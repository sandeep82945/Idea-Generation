Hence, it is essential to assess the primary care preparedness for managing diabetes patients and the perspectives of the diabetes patients on the care received at the primary care facilities. Methods: All 21 Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHCs) in Bhubaneswar city of Odisha, India, were assessed using the modified Primary Care Evaluation Tool and WHO Package of Essential Non-communicable disease interventions questionnaire. Additionally, 21 diabetes patients with comorbidities were interviewed in-depth to explore their perception of the care received at the primary care facilities.\nPati, S., Akker, M. van den, Schellevis, F.G., Sahoo, K.C., Burgers, J.S.

There were few provisions for chronic kidney illness, cardiovascular disease, mental health, and cancer. Diabetes patients felt that frequent change in primary care physicians at the primary care facilities affected their continuity of care. Easy accessibility, availability of free medicines, and provisions of basic laboratory tests at the facilities were felt to be necessary by the diabetes patients. Conclusion: Our study highlights the existing gaps in India\u2019s healthcare system preparedness and the needs of diabetes patients with comorbidity. The government of India\u2019s Health and Wellness (HWC) scheme aims to deliver comprehensive healthcare to the population and provide holistic care at the primary care level for NCD patients. It is imperative that there is an early implementation of the various components of the HWC scheme to provide optimal care to diabetes patients."

However, studies in the past have indicated the low priority of primary care health providers in LMICs for chronic conditions management in comparison to acute conditions.7 Conventionally, primary care in LMICs is mainly oriented toward managing infectious diseases, acute conditions, and reproductive and child health. Though ideally placed for also managing noncommunicable diseases, the resource-constrained and overburdened primary care facilities find it a daunting task to deliver optimal care.\nFor a country like India, which has over 69 million diabetes patients, it is a challenge for the health\nsystem to provide quality care to diabetes patients with comorbidities.8 Though the government of India had launched the National Program for Control of Diabetes, Cancer, and Stroke (NPCDCS) to address the growing non-communicable disease burden and provide adequate care, studies have reported the gaps in the implementation of the programme to address the chronic conditions adequately.9 For example, studies indicate that diabetes patients have a wide range of comorbid conditions that are not included in the NPCDCS programme.10"

Therefore, we evaluated the available facilities at Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHCs) and explored the perspective of diabetes patients on the quality of care received at these facilities."

First, we assessed available facilities at all existing UPHCs in Bhubaneswar, Odisha\u2019s capital city, to determine their readiness to manage non-communicable diseases. We employed a modified Primary Care Evaluation Tool (PCET) and a questionnaire from the WHO Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions (PEN). We purposefully chose all 21 UPHCs. Furthermore, we did a qualitative study to establish the patient viewpoint on available treatments at UPHCs; for each facility, we purposefully picked 1 patient who received care at the UHPC. We did 21 in-depth interviews (IDIs).\nAmong the 21 interviewees, 13 were males, and 8 were females. The age of the interviewees was\nin the range of 35\u201365 years. The number of comorbidities among the interviewees ranged from 1 to 4 comorbidities. Twelve interviewees were from non-slum areas, and 9 were slum residents. Odisha has a literacy rate of 79%, and the respondents represent the general population who usually visit UPHCs (Table 1).\n[Table 1]"

Sometimes the antidiabetics prescribed by the primary care physicians, like gliptins or DPP4 inhibitors, were unavailable in the primary care facilities, and they had to buy them.

            "text": "The present study has explored the preparedness of public primary care facilities in managing diabetes and other comorbidities and the care for diabetes patients from their perspectives.\nOur study found that all urban primary healthcare facilities were easily accessible for patients and had provisions of essential medicines and simple laboratory tests to detect and manage diabetes and hypertension. All facilities had preventive care services for non-communicable diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and common cancers like oral, breast, and cervical cancer. However, the provision of allied healthcare providers like nutritionists, physiotherapists, or mental health counsellors were scarce. Diabetes patients shared that ease of accessibility and free medicines with the availability of basic laboratory tests at the UPHC help them in the management of their disease. However, the nonavailability of medicines for multiple comorbidities lack of testing facilities for comorbidities makes it difficult for them to manage multiple conditions.\nThough medicines for a few common chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension were\nregularly available for free, medication for other comorbidities was mostly not available. Studies in the past have emphasized the role of affordable medicines in adherence to treatment among patients with chronic diseases.20 Similarly, in primary care facilities that did not have provisions for a wide range of laboratory tests, respondents felt it led to increased expenditure and longer travel time to do the tests in private laboratories and then come back with the reports to the consulting primary care physicians. For well-coordinated care, the accessibility of adequate laboratory facilities is one of the basic requirements.21 Hence, it reiterates the need for strengthening the existing primary care facilities\u2019 laboratories and expanding the range of tests. Though many primary care facilities had provision of a yoga instructor and physiotherapist, it was found that respondents did not utilize them. Lack of awareness or motivation could be the reason for this. More awareness by the community health workers on the various amenities provided at the primary care facilities could motivate diabetes patients. The role of counselling in the management of multiple chronic conditions is well documented.22 Our study shows that only one of the 21 facilities had mental health counsellors. Both the National Mental Health Program and the Health and Wellness Centre initiative of the Indian government have guidelines for providing mental health counsellors at the primary care level.23,24 Hence, the inclusion of mental health counsellors into the primary care team should be considered a priority. Familiarity with the primary care physician and interpersonal communication was supposed to facilitate adherence to treatment and optimal disease management. This emphasizes the primary care physician\u2019s integral role in managing chronic conditions. Previous studies have also highlighted the importance of continuity of care by the same primary care physician in managing chronic diseases.25,26 For public primary care facilities where it is common to have frequent changes of healthcare providers, it underscores the need to maintain a consistent team of providers to ensure a satisfactory continuity of care for diabetes patients with comorbidities.\nThe present study was conducted in public primary care facilities, and the exclusion of private\nhealthcare facilities is a limitation of our study. However, as all public primary care facilities under the Capital Hospital were included (n = 21), our study findings allow a generalization for public primary care facilities. Another limitation is the conduct of IDIs over the telephone due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions for the qualitative component of the study. Nonverbal communication during the face-to-face IDI could have added to the strength of the qualitative data of the interview. Moreover, it is felt that the ease of communication is greater in face-to-face interview than in a telephone interview. Similarly, because of the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, diabetes patients in\n2023 __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nThis is a Nivel certified Post Print, more info at nivel.nl 9\ntheir interviews shared that sometimes the primary care physicians did the consultations from a distance and they sometimes only received the medicines from the primary care facilities. The robust sample size of 21 respondents for the qualitative component is a strength of the present study. In this study, all authors are from various educational and professional backgrounds; the diverse educational experience and nationalities of all authors brought their unique perspectives and enhanced the conformability of the study findings.\nFor an LMIC country like India, with a large diabetic population that is expected to increase\nmanifold in the future, strengthened and efficient primary care is the need of the hour. As indicated in our study, though multiple initiatives under the various public health schemes and vertical health programmes to meet the healthcare demands of diabetes patients have been initiated, successful implementation is yet to be achieved. Ensuring early implementation of the initiatives, greater integration of vertical programmes with primary care, and generating more awareness among the community on the availability of these services at the healthcare facilities will go a long way in delivering accessible and quality healthcare to diabetes patients."
