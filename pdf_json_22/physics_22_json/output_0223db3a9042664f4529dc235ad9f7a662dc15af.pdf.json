    "abstractText": "Leader election is a crucial process in many areas such as cloud computing, distributed systems, task orchestration, and blockchain. O entimes, in a distributed system, the network needs to choose a leader, which would be responsible for synchronization between di erent processors, data storage, information distribution, and more. In the case where the network is anonymous, no classical algorithms could solve the problem exactly. However, in the se ing of quantum computers, this problem is readily solved. In this paper, we analyze the quantum consensus algorithm developed by Seiichiro Tani. We look at the inner workings of the algorithm and develop a circuit representation of the key steps. We review Mochon\u2019s fault tolerant leader election algorithm. We then implement a simple leader election algorithm on a quantum computer.",
