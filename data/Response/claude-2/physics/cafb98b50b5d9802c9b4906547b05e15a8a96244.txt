 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the use of Cu2-xSe nanoparticles for detecting other biologically relevant molecules besides glutathione. The peroxidase-like activity and NIR absorption of the nanoparticles could potentially be utilized to sense a wide range of analytes. 

2. Optimize the synthesis and properties of Cu2-xSe nanoparticles to further enhance their peroxidase-like catalytic activity. This could involve tweaking parameters like size, shape, and copper vacancy concentration.

3. Explore the use of Cu2-xSe nanoparticles for photothermal therapy applications, like cancer treatment. Their strong NIR absorption and photothermal conversion make them promising for selective cell/tumor ablation.

4. Develop Cu2-xSe nanoparticle-based test strips or microfluidic devices for portable, rapid glutathione detection. This could enable convenient point-of-care testing.

5. Investigate the in vivo behavior and toxicity of Cu2-xSe nanoparticles. This is important for translating their use to real-world applications like sensing, imaging, and therapy in biological systems. Parameters like biodistribution, clearance, and biocompatibility need to be assessed.
