Objective: This study aimed to assess CRT in individuals after acute COVID-19 infection over 1 year. Methods: We prospectively analyzed 30 individuals (male: 9, female: 21) with mild-moderate functional status after COVID-19 and 30 individuals (male: 8, female: 22) without COVID-19. Cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms were evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), respectively. CRT (milliseconds) was evaluated by finding the difference between the photodiode signal and the electromyographic (EMG) onset latency of anterior deltoid, brachial biceps, and triceps during the task of reaching a luminous target. CRT was evaluated three times over 1 year after COVID-19: baseline assessment (>4 weeks of COVID-19 diagnosis), between 3 and 6 months, and between 6 and 12 months. Results: The multiple comparison analysis shows CRT reduction of the anterior deltoid in the COVID-19 group at 3-6 (p=0.001) and 6-12 months (p<0.001) compared to the control group. We also observed CRT reduction of the triceps at 6-12 months (p=0.002) and brachial biceps at 0-3 (p<0.001), 3-6 (p<0.001), and 6-12 months (p<0.001) in the COVID-19 compared to the control group. Moderate correlations were observed between MoCA and CRT of the anterior deltoid (r=-0.63; p=0.002) and brachial biceps (r=-0.67; p=0.001) at 6\u201312 months in the COVID-19 group. Conclusions: There was a reduction in CRT after acute COVID-19 over 1 year. A negative correlation was also observed between MoCA and CRT only from 6 to 12 months after COVID-19 infection.",

            "text": "Some studies have demonstrated associations between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and neurological dysfunction in the early phase1 and long term, mainly cognitive deficits in executive function, attention, language, and delayed recall2,3. The virus can enter the cerebral circulation by interacting with the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor and infect neural cells3,4 or cross the blood-brain barrier and activate the brain\u2019s immune cell to produce neural cytokines, leading to brain dysfunction5.\nThe spread and persistence of the virus in brain cells remains debatable. However, several studies have observed that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can change brain activity and connectivity6-8, causing cognitive dysfunction for months after infection9,10. In addition, there are increasingly frequent reports of memory impairment, concentration difficulties, and long-term neuropsychiatric symptoms11,12. This long COVID-19 status is defined as \u201cbrain fog,\u201d which is the cognitive complaint of slow and confused thinking9,10.\nAssessment of cognitive processing speed through choice reaction time (CRT) can be an objective tool to assess brain fog after acute COVID-19. Decision-making is the reaction time (RT) for more than one visual stimulus (choice RT) and the onset of muscle activity to assess cognitive function and processing speed13. The CRT process includes many cognitive functions, such as recognition, association, coordination, inhibition, and decision planning stages14,15. These cognitive changes after the acute period of COVID-19 can have long-term negative impacts, resulting in cognitive, behavioral, and emotional changes9,10.\nLong-term monitoring of neurological and cognitive function in individuals after COVID-19 infection is necessary to understand changes in cognitive behavior and verify possible neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, Hellmuth et\u00a0al. showed that cognitive deficits were not captured by common cognitive screens, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), suggesting that systematic and objective cognitive tests can be more beneficial after acute COVID-1916. Therefore, this study aimed to assess CRT in individuals with acute COVID-19 after over 1 year. In addition, the correlation between MoCA, anxiety, depression, and CRT was also evaluated in the COVID-19 group."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "This study found a reduction in CRT in individuals after COVID-19 infection over 1 year. CRT reduction was found at 3-6 and 6-12 months after acute infection of the anterior deltoid, 6-12 months for triceps, and the brachial biceps in all evaluations compared to the control group. In other words, individuals who have had COVID-19 showed reduced CRT compared to the control group over 1 year. In addition, we observed moderate negative correlations between MoCA and CRT of the anterior deltoid and brachial biceps at 6\u201312 months.\nThere are four cognitive processes that can be distinguished in CRT tasks: (1) stimulus perception,\nLuvizutto GJ, et\u00a0al. COVID-19 and choice reaction time. 359\n(2) stimulus discrimination, (3) response choice, and (4) motor response23. RT is important for activities of daily living, requires sensory skills, cognitive processing, and motor performance24, and correlates with neuropsychological tests of processing speed and higher order cognitive processes in younger and older adults25. Prolonged CRT is associated with decreased cognitive function23. Some studies showed that COVID-19 could also alter the brain\u2019s functional connectivity pattern, causing cognitive dysfunction for months after infection resolution26,27. Hugon et\u00a0al. also showed marked attentional and executive cognitive impairment in a patient with mild COVID-1920.\nBased on the CRT changes observed, can SARSCoV-2 cause neurological damage to decrease cognitive decision-making in the first year after COVID-19? Can CRT be a resource to diagnose early alterations or post-COVID syndrome? Is CRT a potential predictor of the progression of cognitive loss in long-term COVID-19? The long-term course of these brain lesions and clinical symptoms in mild forms of COVID-19 is difficult to predict. Some authors have mentioned that the evolution toward neurodegenerative diseases could be seen over a prolonged period of time19,20,28. In addition, recovery from COVID-19 infection may be associated with particularly pronounced problems in aspects of higher cognitive or \u201cexecutive\u201d function29.\nIn this study, a correlation was observed between MoCA and CRT only in the period from 6 to 12 months; that is, the lower the MoCA value, the greatest the CRT of the anterior deltoid and brachial biceps muscles. Some authors have presented hypotheses about long-term neurocognitive alterations in individuals who have had COVID-19. These authors reported direct and indirect effects to explain these changes. Regarding direct effects, the authors observed the presence of viral reactivation or hyperactivity of the immune system30; and in relation to indirect factors, they report associated extrinsic aspects, such as environmental changes, social isolation, personal and economic factors, as well as lifestyle changes that could later modify neurological and neuropsychiatric function30. In addition, associated clinical factors such as fatigue or cardiorespiratory changes can secondarily interfere with cognitive ability; however, these variables were not controlled in this study31.\nSome limitations of this study should be highlighted. The first is small sample size \u2014 which limits the\nstatistical power of our analysis; in order to obtain the best reliability of our analyses, we established strict inclusion criteria to avoid interpretation errors. Even limiting the power of our analysis, the possibility of focusing on a homogeneous subgroup allowed us to minimize the effect of all possible confounders. The second limitation is that due to technical and operational limitations, accuracy and precision were not evaluated during the CRT test, and therefore, they are variables to be controlled in future studies. The third limitation is that objective analysis of fatigue and cardiovascular performance was not performed, which may interfere with cognitive response. Finally, the fourth limitation is that there was no functional MRI analysis to understand the changes at the structural level.\nOur findings have important clinical implications in the subacute and chronic phases of COVID-19 because CRT is a simple, low-cost method that can be used as a diagnostic method for brain fog in post-COVID syndrome. Furthermore, these results will help plan and develop multidisciplinary care strategies to improve cognitive performance after COVID-19 infection.\nIn conclusion, there was a reduction in CRT after acute COVID-19 over 1-year period. CRT reduction was found in the anterior deltoid at 3-6 and 6-12 months, triceps at 6-12 months, and brachial biceps in all evaluations. In addition, a negative correlation was observed between MoCA and CRT only from 6 to 12 months after COVID-19 infection."
