Exploring Other Stemness-Related Genes in CSCs: Beyond NANOG and OCT4, there could be other stemness-related genes contributing to drug resistance and cancer stem cell survival. Future research could focus on identifying and characterizing these genes, their roles in GBM and other cancers, and their potential as therapeutic targets. This could involve comprehensive transcriptomic or proteomic analyses to discover novel targets.

Combination Therapies Involving RNAi and Other Anticancer Agents: The paper highlights the effectiveness of combining RNAi targeting NANOG and OCT4 with temozolomide (TMZ). Future studies could explore other anticancer agents that may synergize with RNAi targeting stemness genes. This could include investigating the combination of RNAi with novel chemotherapeutics, targeted therapies, immunotherapies, or radiotherapy to enhance treatment efficacy against GBM.

Mechanisms of PI3K/AKT Pathway Regulation by NANOG: The study points to the critical role of the PI3K/AKT pathway in CSC survival and drug resistance, modulated by NANOG. Further research could delve deeper into the molecular mechanisms by which NANOG influences this pathway. This could involve studying the interaction between NANOG and other molecules in the pathway, the role of post-translational modifications, and how these interactions affect CSC properties and response to therapy.

Role of Exosomes in Mediating Drug Resistance: The study suggests that CSC-secreted exosomes containing stemness genes like NANOGP8 may play a role in inducing drug resistance. Future research could focus on the role of exosomes in the microenvironment of GBM and other tumors, how they contribute to the communication between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment, and their potential as targets or delivery vehicles for therapy.

Clinical Trials of RNAi-Based Therapeutics Targeting CSCs: Based on the promising results of RNAi in reducing stemness and enhancing drug sensitivity in CSCs, conducting clinical trials of RNAi-based therapeutics targeting NANOG, OCT4, or other stemness-related genes in GBM patients could be a logical next step. These studies could focus on assessing the safety, efficacy, and optimal delivery methods of RNAi therapeutics in combination with standard GBM treatments.
