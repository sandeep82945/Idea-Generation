    "abstractText": "COVID-19 infections pose a serious global health concern so it is crucial to identify the biomarkers for the susceptibility to and resistance against this disease that could help in a rapid risk assessment and reliable decisions being made on patients\u2019 treatment and their potential hospitalisation. Several studies investigated the factors associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes that can be either environmental, population based, or genetic. It was demonstrated that the genetics of the host plays an important role in the various immune responses and, therefore, there are different clinical presentations of COVID-19 infection. In this study, we aimed to use variant descriptive statistics from GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Study) and variant genomic annotations to identify metabolic pathways that are associated with a severe COVID-19 infection as well as pathways related to resistance to COVID-19. For this purpose, we applied a custom-designed mixed linear model implemented into custom-written software. Our analysis of more than 12.5 million SNPs did not indicate any pathway that was significant for a severe COVID-19 infection. However, the Allograft rejection pathway (hsa05330) was significant (p = 0.01087) for resistance to the infection. The majority of the 27 SNP marking genes constituting the Allograft rejection pathway were located on chromosome 6 (19 SNPs) and the remainder were mapped to chromosomes 2, 3, 10, 12, 20, and X. This pathway comprises several immune system components crucial for the self versus non-self recognition, but also the components of antiviral immunity. Our study demonstrated that not only single variants are important for resistance to COVID-19, but also the cumulative impact of several SNPs within the same pathway matters.",

            "text": "COVID-19 infections pose a serious global health concern, so it remains crucial to identify the biomarkers for the susceptibility to and resistance against this disease that could help in a rapid risk assessment and reliable decisions being made on patients\u2019 treatment and their potential hospitalisation. The knowledge of genomic variants that are associated with the susceptibility to and resistance against COVID-19 infections is essential for understanding the metabolic pathways and regulatory factors related to different presentations of the disease and, in consequence, for developing new drug targets [1]. Several studies investigated factors associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes that can be either environmental, population based, or genetic. For instance, a geographic and population variation in the disease course and outcome has demonstrated that individuals representing Black, Hispanic, or Asian ethnicities have a higher risk of death compared to Caucasians [2,3]. The identified risk factors of COVID-19 infection are advanced age, male sex, and comorbidities (especially: renal disease, oncological pathologies, chronic respiratory disease, and cardiovascular disease\u2014excluding hypertension and dementia), but they do not fully explain the wide spectrum of disease manifestations [2,4\u20136]. Moreover, the viral load can play a role in the COVID-19 severity, as demonstrated for mortality, especially in combination with advanced age [7,8]. On the other hand, many studies have supported the hypothesis that there are patients who have a natural resistance to COVID-19 infection. For instance, children or adolescents were barely affected [9] and they showed antibody responses up to four months after infection [10]. Thus, some children appear to be able to either repel the infection without the need to strongly engage adaptive immunity or are resistant to infection. It was also demonstrated that the genetics of the host plays an important role in the various immune responses and, therefore, in the different clinical presentations of COVID-19 infection. Risk and protective variants were associated with multiple loci on chromosomes 3, 9, 6, 12, 19, and 21 [11,12] including a segment on chromosome 9 that defines the ABO blood groups [13], a segment on chromosome 12 that contains OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3 [14], and an isoform p41 of CD74, which is a part of the MHC-II that blocks the endosomal entry pathway of the virus [15]. Further significant genes were ACE2 located on chromosome X and human leukocyte antigens (HLA). The main aim of our study was to use variant descriptive statistics from GWAS and variant genomic annotations to identify metabolic pathways that are associated with a severe COVID-19 infection as well as pathways related to resistance to COVID-19. For this purpose, we applied a custom-designed mixed linear model implemented in customwritten software."

            "text": "The raw number of SNPs amounted to 43,469,928; out of these, after filtering, 9,767,423 SNPs remained for GWAS analysis (Figure 1). The most significant SNP from GWAS was located on chromosome 7 (p = 7.10547\u00d7 10\u22129) within the intron of RAPGEF5 gene (ENSG00000136237); however, this gene is not assigned to any KEGG pathway. In total, 12,736 SNPs were included in the pathway model. Out of the 288 KEGG pathway effects predicted, none were significant in the SEVERE analysis, while the Allograft rejection pathway (hsa05330) was significant (p = 0.01087) in the RESISTANT analysis. All 27 SNPs, each representing one gene constituting hsa05330, were significant in GWAS (Table 1, Figure 2). The majority of them were located on chromosome 6 (19 SNPs) and the remainder were mapped to chromosomes 2, 3, 10, 12, 20, and X. The summary of read depth quality underlying each variant in each sample is summarised in Supplementary Figure S1. Interestingly, the comparison of p-values of all SNPs from GWAS with p-values of the subset of SNPs included in the KEGG model showed that genic SNPs have lower p-values than intergenic SNPs (Figure 3)."

            "text": "An important property of the human immune system is natural resistance, defined as the inability of pathogens, viruses included, to infect the host or as an ability of the host to limit the disease burden after infection [16]. Two mechanisms of natural resistance have been suggested [17]. The first mechanism comprises genetic variants in genes important for entry mechanisms, especially in the receptors. The second mechanism is the rapid elimination of the pathogen by host resistance mechanisms. As for the host\u2019s survival, the balance between resistance mechanisms aiming to eliminate host pathogens and tolerance mechanisms aiming to avoid collateral damage induced by inflammation is crucial; natural resistance is mostly related to the immune system, either to its robustness or on the genetic level [17]. In our study, we used GWAS and custom-designed models to identify molecular pathways related to different presentations of COVID-19 infections and to describe significant genetic variants within these pathways. Interestingly, the comparison between the full dataset (all SNPs analysed in GWAS) and the subset used in the estimation of KEGG pathway effects, demonstrated that the majority of most significant p-values were assigned to intergenic SNPs (Figure 3), which can only be used as markers for a potential association with genes, but not as causal mutations. Moreover, although the most common cause of such a significant association is linkage, it is not exclusive proof that an associated SNP always points to the closest located gene as the functional cause of a phenotype (see, e.g., [18]). It was demonstrated that SNP density across the human genome is reduced in conserved regions [19]. However, both exonic and intronic regions are constrained to the same degree and they contain a reduced density of SNPs in comparison to intergenic regions [19]. Therefore, the custom-designed models for the KEGG pathways\u2019 analysis used in this study allowed us to consider additional aspects of the genetic background in COVID-19 infections that were not identified in single SNP GWAS analyses. Our analysis did not indicate any significant pathway in the case of a severe COVID-19 phenotype. However, in the case of a resistant phenotype, the Allograft rejection pathway (hsa05330) was identified as significant, with 27 SNPs marking genes constituting this pathway. The Allograft rejection pathway (Figure 4), associated with resistance to COVID19 infection, comprises several immune system components crucial for self versus non-self recognition, but also the components of antiviral immunity [20]. Molecules involved in this pathway play pivotal roles in many other physiological and pathological processes, including allergies or even an anticancer response [20]. For all those processes the interplay between at least two cells is crucial, one of which remains the immune cell. The majority of the significant SNPs from the Allograft rejection pathway marked genes from the HLA complex (18 SNPs on chromosome 6, Table 1) that encode proteins forming the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and several of them were already indicated as proteins protective against COVID-19 infection [21]. Considering the genomic location of the 27 SNPs from the Allograft rejection pathway (Table 1), five SNPs were identified in CD (cluster of differentiation\u2014classification determinant of immune cells) protein-coding genes, as depicted in the table below (Table 2). CD40 is a member of the TNF superfamily, constitutively expressed on B cells and APC cells [22,23]. CD40 binds its ligand CD40L, which is transiently expressed on T cells and other non-immune cells under inflammatory conditions [24]. CD28 is expressed on T cells, providing signals required for T cell activation and survival, and CD80 and CD86 are its ligands [25\u201328]. The activity of CD80\u2013CD28 complex stimulates the activation of transcription factors NF-\u03baB, promoting IL-2 production [22,26,29,30]. CD80 is also a ligand for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4, also known as CD152), which remains constitutively expressed on most of the T cells, for example, on Tregs, in which CTLA-4 expression increases upon activation [25,27,29]. CD28 competes with CTLA-4 for binding to CD80 and CD86 [26,29,31]. Interestingly, CD80 and CD86 proteins may act as receptors for some adenoviruses [22]. Malfunctioning CD80 molecules are also involved in some pathological\nconditions, such as lupus erythematosus. CD86 is also associated with myocarditis and gallbladder squamous cell carcinoma [22].\nOne SNP on chromosome 12 pointed out interferon IFN-gamma, which is a cytokine produced mostly by activated T cells and NK cells and that can induce MHC expression, which makes it an important factor in transplantation. IFN plays a dual role in COVID-19 infections, on one side aggravating the symptoms, and on the other alleviating the disease course, depending on the disease stage and types of the interferon involved and on the personal predispositions [31]. This occurred in some patients shown to be associated with higher mortality [31], whereas in others poor IFN responses were associated with a more severe disease course [32,33]. In immunosuppressed patients, IFN has a beneficial effect and was applied as an adjuvant treatment [34]. It was shown in mice models that a lack of IFNg led to the failure of microcirculation and necrosis of transplants, which suggested that IFNg modulates allogenic responses and could have a protective role in the early stages of the response to an organ allograft. On the other hand, IFNg promoted graft vessel disease at the later stages [35]. Therefore, the effect of IFNg on an organ allograft depended on the time after transplantation and graft type [36]. The pivotal role of IFNg in allograft rejection has been suggested also in humans. High rates of primary and secondary rejection after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were reported in a cohort of eight HLA-identical paediatric patients [37]. Already at day +3 after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in 15 children experiencing graft rejection, the levels of IFNg were significantly higher than in the control group, and IFNg has been suggested to be a marker of early graft rejection [38].\nUnsurprisingly, the outcome of COVID-19 has been reported to be more severe in patients with co-existing pathologies, especially those associated with an impaired immune system [39,40]. The complex relationship existing between the immune system component, cancer, and COVID-19 brings about the possibility of continuing immune checkpoint inhibitors treatment among COVID-19 positive cancer patients, as well as the use of immunotherapy for the treatment of severe COVID-19 infection. In fact, several attempts have already been made, some of which are undoubtedly very promising [40\u201342]. It is known now that cancer patients have an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection often leading to hospitalization and intensive care [43,44]. Given the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus might potentially trigger immune system over-reactivity in some patients, T cell exhaustion has also been observed in a subset of patients. Immune checkpoint inhibitors remain a useful tool used to modulate the immune reaction [43]. It is worth emphasizing that some COVID-19 patients exhibit lymphocytopenia and suffer from T cell exhaustion, a phenomenon very common in advanced cancer disease, which\u2014in the case of COVID-19 infection\u2014may lead to viral sepsis and an increased mortality rate [39,42,43]. It has been observed that in cancer patients, especially among immunocompromised individuals, treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitors may restore their antitumoral immune response [42]. The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in COVID-19 cases has been reviewed well in [42].\nDespite the promising results, we must bear in mind the fact that severe COVID-19 might also be triggered by immune system aberrations, such as inborn errors of the interferon pathways [45]. The human immune system remains extremely complex and involves many genes and genomic elements, including those genes encoding cytokines: individuals that lack specific cytokines, such as interferons, or possessing gene alleles potentially impairing immune system functioning, can be more susceptible to certain infectious diseases, including COVID-19. In these people, immunotherapy should be administered with particular caution, including cancer patients. The immunological synapse is an important element in the Allograft rejection pathway. The structure of the immunological synapse, i.e., the gap between the immune cell and another cell, such as antigen-presenting cells, APC, together with its complex molecular interactions and canonical, means the step-manner organisation has been known as \u201cthe bull\u2019s eye structure\u201d, with the central complex made of MHC-TCR (major histocompatibility complex\u2013T cell receptor), leading to it providing the first signal [29,46\u201349]. The interaction between MHC and TCR controls the specificity and accuracy of the immune response, as the TCR genes undergo several complicated rearrangements similar to those known from antibody genes [46,48]. Furthermore, a central element of the synapse might be a directed secretion of soluble molecules into the synaptic cleft [46,50]. All other molecules, such as the LFA-1-ICAM adhesion complex, or checkpoint molecules, form distal rings and clusters around the MHC-TCR complex. The rings are required to modulate the response by providing secondary signals since the interaction between MHC and TCR is insufficient [46,49,51]. If no secondary signal is provided, the T cell becomes anergic or even undergoes apoptosis [49]. Summing up, at least two signals are required to activate a T cell: the first is an antigen recognition by the T cell receptor and MHC complex, the second is provided by the multitude of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory receptors and ligands interactions, all of which are crucial in the allograft rejection pathway cell to cell interconnections [52]. Interestingly, studies have reported the relationship between antiCOVID-19 immunisation and acute corneal graft rejection, regardless of the vaccine or graft type [53\u201356]. Moreover, acute allograft rejection after immunisation was observed in the case of kidney and liver transplants [57]. However, a direct causative effect is hard to prove and needs further studies. Furthermore, two SNPs were found on chromosome 10 (Table 1). The first of those SNPs was located within the Fas receptor (CD95), which plays an important role in the maintenance of immune tolerance. Fas-induced apoptosis (induced by Fas\u2013FasL interactions) is involved in the cytotoxic activity of T cells and NK cells [58,59]. Studies conducted in mice models showed that mutations in Fas or FasL that inactivated their function led to disturbances in the immune response to infections with multiple different viruses, such as the influenza virus [60], herpes simplex viruses, mouse hepatitis virus or, mousepox virus [61]. Moreover, it was shown that Fas could play a role in the destruction of graft tissue. Although mechanisms for allograft injury remain unclear, the contribution of Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) was verified in the case of different commonly transplanted organs (e.g., liver, lungs, kidneys) that were probably targeted by FasL-expressing cytotoxic T lymphocytes [62]. In humans, it was shown in vivo that an increased sCD95 is related to the rejection in liver-transplanted recipients [63,64]. The most significant SNP from GWAS, marking the RAPGEF5 gene, with an outstanding p-value of 7.10547 \u00d7 10\u22129, was not assigned to any KEGG pathway. RAPGEF5 encodes Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor 5 protein and belongs to the Ras family of GTPases that plays an important role in cell growth, differentiation, and malignant transformation [65]. The gene has not been associated with severe COVID infection in previous GWAS."

In this context of statistical modelling, as compared to GWAS, the goal is to estimate the joint effects of multiple genes (here represented by SNPs) acting functionally together within a metabolic pathway. Individual effects of many of the genes would have been disregarded in a conventional GWAS as nonsignificant, but they may play a role in a joint metabolic response to infection. The estimation of KEGG pathway effects was based on the following mixed linear model\n|v| = \u00b5 + Wt + \u03b5, (4)\nwhere, |v| (12,736) is the vector of absolute values of SNP effects estimated from GWAS that were mapped to genes; \u00b5 (12,736) is the general mean; t (288) is the random effect KEGG pathway effect with a pre-imposed normal distribution defined by N ( 0, V\u03c32t ) ; W (12,736 \u00d7 288) is the corresponding incidence matrix for t assigning SNPs to KEGG pathways; \u03b5 (12,736) is a vector of residuals distributed as N ( 0, I\u03c32\u03b5 ) . The covariance matrix between KEGG pathways (V) was expressed by the Jaccard similarity coefficient J(i, j) = KN , where K represents the number of genes shared between KEGG i and j, while N represents the total number of genes involved in KEGG i and j. Variance components were assumed as known, amounting to \u03c32t = 0.3\u03c3 2 y and \u03c32e = 1\u2212 \u03c32y . Note that to avoid confounding, within each gene, only one SNP with the highest effect from GWAS was selected for the analysis. The mixed model equations (Henderson C.R. 1984 University of Guelph) were used to obtain solutions for \u00b5 and t\u00b5\u0302\nt\u0302\n = [1TR\u221211 1TR\u22121W WR\u221211 WTR\u22121W + G\u22121\u2217 ]\u22121[ 1TR\u22121|v| WTR\u22121|v| ] , where R = I\u03c3\u0302 2 \u03b5 and G\u2217 = V\u03c3\u0302 2 t . (5)\nTo maximise the computational performance of the estimation (\u00b5\u0302) and prediction (t\u0302) process, a custom Python program implementing the NumPy library was used [78]. Since all calculations were carried out on a high-performance server, the NumPy library was also used to set the array indexing and ordering, which further improved the computing time\nas compared to a native Python application. Each element of t\u0302 was assessed for significance (H0 : ti \u2264 0 vs. H1 : ti > 0) by calculating the probability of obtaining a more extreme value using the N ( 0, \u03c32t ) density function."

Moreover, the Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) evaluations provided a full characterization of the entire genome of SARS-CoV-2, and nowadays it is used not only for the discovery of novel molecular variants of this virus, but also to detect novel emerging strains that might pose a threat to public health. The identification of new\nmutations in the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is also crucial for the development of novel vaccines [80]. Here, we used GWAS analysis to identify metabolic pathways that are associated with a severe COVID-19 infection as well as pathways related to resistance to COVID-19. The main finding of this study were:\n(1) the Allograft rejection pathway (hsa05330) was significant for the resistance to the COVID-19 infection; (2) 27 SNPs marking genes constituting the Allograft rejection pathway, and the majority of these were located on chromosome 6 (19 SNPs), while the remainder were mapped to chromosomes 2, 3, 10, 12, 20, and X. (3) the Allograft rejection pathway comprises several immune system components crucial for the self versus non-self recognition, and also the components of antiviral immunity; (4) no significant metabolic pathway was indicated in the case of susceptibility to COVID19 and its severe course.\nOur study showed that not only are single variants important, but also the cumulative impact of several SNPs within the same pathway seems to matter in the case of severe COVID-19 disease. This evidence supports the notion of a multifactorial background of a disease course. Moreover, as previously indicated by us and others, accumulating evidence suggests inborn errors of the immune system components, especially IFN and TNF superfamily members, are crucial when it comes to the COVID-19 severe course.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms23116272/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.S.
