This paper was recommended for publication by Editor WANG Jue.\nSao Paulo stock Exchange index plunged 14.78%, the biggest one-day drop in 21 years; Chile\u2019s Santiago stock market IPSA index dropped 6.33 percent on Monday, the biggest one-day drop in nine years. Interestingly, the crisis usually accompanies with financial contagion where prices experience downward movement. As shown in Yuan[1], large downward price movements are contagious. Undoubtedly, financial contagion can not only occur in local markets, but also spread to the global financial markets owning to its highly contagion effect. It seems that prices contagion in one market is plausible for explaining the contagion among closely linked markets since they share similar macroeconomic risks[2, 3], such as the markets in developed countries. However, these contributions can not completely account for the cross-regional contagion if markets are not closely linked[4], for example, the emerging countries like South East Asia and Latin America.\nAlthough it is challenging to figure out how many detailed factors that affect the price movement, there are two widely acknowledged factors that influence the asset price undoubtedly, i.e., the fundamental and the noise[5]. The fundamentals represent the macroeconomic factors, such as international trade, foreign direct investment, or the value factors of one firm. While the noise traders usually function as the liquidity provider. An interesting question to ask is then, what was the driving force behind this transmission of negative shocks from one country to another especially for the countries that are not linked? Was it liquidity shock driven? Perhaps liquidity shock alone cannot completely account for the cross-sectional pattern of contagion. When hit with a liquidity shock, market participant would like to liquidate their positions in developed countries since highly liquid markets can attenuate the impact of sell orders on prices, not emerging markets[6]. Hence, the contagion mechanism between the developed countries and the emerging countries still needs to be further clarified.\nIn general, assets with related macroeconomic fundamentals may experience similar volatility tendency. Intuitively, it seems that assets from the unlinked countries cannot be directly affected from the developed countries via the fundamental since their fundamentals are different. However, the market crisis during COVID-19 turns out actually the contagion exists. In this paper, we try to derive this result by introducing a third intermediate that bridges the unlinked countries from the view of fundamental.\nTo construct the contagion model, it is necessary to seek one intermediate that connects the two types of unlinked countries. To this end, this intermediate must function as the bridge that interact with the two unlinked countries at the same time. Specifically, we specify one asset (for example, the market index) that represents one country and analyze the comovement of the three assets. In our model, asset A and asset C do not share any common fundamental factor, instead, asset A and asset B share an exposure to one fundamental risk, and asset B and asset C share another fundamental risk. We therefore refer to Grossman and Stiglitz[7]\u2019s model and extend it to a three-risky-asset setting where traders can learn information from other asset prices. This mechanism prompts the information transmission from one asset to another because prices tend to aggregate all the differential information in equilibrium. In other words, cross-asset learning helps the investors know more about whole markets and reduces the uncertainty about fundamentals, however, it can also propagate the fundamental risk by means\nof prices. We discover that, in this mechanism, liquidity displays positive comovement effect among the three assets. That is, an initial drop in liquidity for one asset will give rise to the same plight for the intermediate asset, and eventually, it can cause liquidity shortage for the third asset. Similarly, the comovement effect also happens for price informativeness. In other words, as the noise trading volume increases in one asset, the price informativeness tends to be low for that asset, which can, through cross-asset learning, induce augmented noise trading risk and thus results in low price informativeness for another asset.\nFurthermore, our model shows that there exists a negative interaction between illiquidity and price informativeness associated with cross-asset learning. That is, an increase in illiquidity lowers price informativeness and vice versa. In reality, assets values may be affected by a series of common fundamentals. This implies an initial liquidity shock of one asset can propagate to other assets and be amplified through mutual interaction. Hence, accompanying with the financial contagion across the assets, the whole market may be in low price informativeness and high liquidity risk, leaving the market in crisis.\nOur paper is related to the burgeoning rational expectation equilibrium (REE) models about multiple assets, in papers that feature such models[2, 3, 8], rational traders can use the price information to update their expectations. Goldstein, et al.[2] extended Grossman and Stiglitz[7]\u2019s model to segmented markets and assume price information can flow across markets. Cespa and Foucoult[3] supposed that price information is available to dealers across the markets. While in our model, we retain the assumption that price information is accessible among investors, and distinctively we focus on the process of price contagion from one asset to another and its potent insights for market crisis.\nNumerous theoretical and empirical literature has greatly contributed to the study about the price comovement effect within markets. Papers about such research findings mainly focus on the contagion through a correlated information or liquidity shock[1, 3, 9]. Our paper is also related to the extensive works about contagion among financial markets[4, 10\u201312]. Allen and Gale[10] provided contagion caused by linkages among financial intermediaries. Kodres and Pritsker[4] also developed a multiple asset REE model to explain the financial contagion. We follow Kodres and Pritsker[4]\u2019s model and try to explain the financial contagion from the way of illiquidity contagion. Recent research about financial contagion about multiple assets is Zeng, et al.[12] who constructed the contagion model from the view of common sentiment that bridges the connection between prices learned by rational traders. However, in our model, we innovatively adopt the shared fundamental risk factors to describe how the contagion occurs between unlinked assets and our model is the complement of Zeng, et al.[12]. And the shared fundamental factors represent the systematic macroeconomic risk.\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we propose the model, as well as constructing the trading environment and solve for traders\u2019 strategies. In Section 3, we define the equilibrium and discusses its properties. Finally, we make the conclusion in Section 4."

            "text": "To illustrate the contagion among three countries, we consider three segmented markets in which there are four assets traded including one riskless asset (with elastic supply) of unitary return and three risky assets A, B and C in each market with the corresponding payoffs:\n\u23a7 \u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\nvA = \u03b81 + \u03b5A,\nvB = \u03b81 + \u03b82 + \u03b5B,\nvC = \u03b82 + \u03b5C ,\nwhere \u03b5A, \u03b5B and \u03b5C are residual uncertainty terms conditional on the fundamental values \u03b81 and \u03b82, and \u03b8i \u223c N ( 0, \u03c4\u22121\u03b8i ) , \u03b5k \u223c N ( 0, \u03c4\u22121\u03b5k ) (\u03c4\u03b8i , \u03c4\u03b5k > 0), i = 1, 2, k = A, B, C. The most important feature here is that A and C share no common fundamental risk, while A and B, B and C share common fundamental risk factors \u03b81, \u03b82, respectively. Here is an example, asset A can be regarded as one company which produces plastic toy, and asset B can be regarded as one company which produces plastic medical equipment, while asset C can be regarded as one company which manufacture medicine. Intuitively, the fundamentals of asset A and asset B are relevant because they are affected by the price of plastic. Similarly, the fundamentals of asset B and asset C are relevant since they belong to same industry. However, the fundamentals of asset A and asset C are irrelevant since they belong to different industries.\nThere are three classes of rational traders in the economy corresponding to the three assets A, B, C: A-informed traders\u2020 (of mass \u03b1) endowed with the private information \u03b81. B-informed traders (of mass \u03b2) with the private information \u03b82. C-informed traders (of mass \u03bb) with the private information \u03b82 and C-uninformed traders (of mass 1 \u2212 \u03bb). As argued by Paul[13], one of the most important functions of the price system is the decentralized aggregation of information since no single person or institution can process all information relevant to pricing, here we leave out B-informed traders with \u03b81 informed. The riskless asset is traded at price 1, and the risky assets are traded at prices pA, pB and pC , respectively. Furthermore, similar with Cespa and Foucault[3], we assume there is no cross-asset trading so that effects can only arise from cross-asset learning rather than from hedging effects.\nThe irrational traders named as noise traders provide market liquidity and their trading is exogenously given as uA, uB and uC , respectively, where uA \u223c N ( 0, \u03c4\u22121uA ) , uB \u223c N ( 0, \u03c4\u22121uB ) , uC \u223c N ( 0, \u03c4\u22121uC ) , and \u03c4uA > 0, \u03c4uB > 0, \u03c4uC > 0.\nWhen trading occurs, pA will be incorporated into the strategies of B-traders and therefore influence the formation of pB which can further affect pC via C-traders\u2019 free riding. Due to the fact that asset A and asset C share no common fundamentals, the price contagion cannot happen directly between these two assets. In our model, the contagion mechanism bridges the connections between assets A and C through the intermediate B, which ultimately results in the price information about asset A to be revealed in asset C. A parsimony version of such a\n\u2020For convenience, we omit A-uninformed traders and B-uninformed traders since they have no impact on price informativeness and our results do not depend on them.\nview could be depicted in Figure 1. Since asset A and asset C are symmetric, so the contagion path can also be from asset C to asset B, and then from asset B to asset A.\nAsset A Asset B Asset CPA PB\nFigure 1 The contagion mechanism\nTo sum up, (\u03b81, \u03b82, \u03b5A, \u03b5B, \u03b5C , uA, uB, uC) are underlying random variables which describe the economy. They are all independent with each other. In the economy just characterized, each investor has CARA preference with risk-averse coefficient 1 and only trade one asset."

They choose the riskless asset DA and risky asset XA to maximize their expected utility:\nE [\u2212e\u2212WA |\u03b81, pA, pB, pC ] ,\nwhere WA = (vA \u2212 pA)XA + DA. The CARA-normal setup implies the optimal demand of one A-informed trader is:\nXA (\u03b81, pA, pB, pC) = E [\u03b81 |\u03b81, pA, pB, pC ] \u2212 pA\nVar [\u03b81 |\u03b81, pA, pB, pC ] + \u03c4\u22121\u03b5A .

(4)\nHence, according to normal-distributed setup, the price of A-asset is a linear function of {\u03b81, pB, pC , uA}, and similarly, the prices of B-asset and C-asset are linear functions of {\u03b82, pA, pC , uB} and {\u03b82, pA, pB, uC}, respectively. We then define the rational expectation equilibrium and solve for the prices."

And the conditional expectation E [vC |pA, pB, pC ] in (4) is equal to solving E [vC |zA, zB, zC ] = E [\u03b82 |zB, zC ].\nBy computation, plugging traders\u2019 strategies into market clearing condition, we immediately derive the following proposition.\nProposition 1 There exists a unique linear REE in which prices are given as follows:\npA = A1\u03b81 + A2uA,\npB = B1\u03b82 + B2uB + B3zA,\npC = C1\u03b82 + C2uC + C3zB,\nwhere the coefficients are endogenously determined and given as follows:\nA1 = 1, A2 = 1\n\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5A , A3 = 0, A4 = 0, B1 = 1, B2 = 1 \u03b2M , B3 = (\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5A)\n2 \u03c4uA\nM ,\nB4 = 0, M = \u03c4\u03b81 + (\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5A ) 2\u03c4uA , C1 = \u03bb\u03c4\u03b5C (\u03c4\u03b5C + \u03c4 )+ (1 \u2212 \u03bb) \u03c4\u03b5C (\u03bb\u03c4\u03b5C )2\u03c4uC N (\u03c4\u03b5C + \u03c4 ) ,\nC2 = (\u03c4\u03b5C + \u03c4 )+ (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u03bb\u03c42\u03b5C \u03c4uC\nN (\u03c4\u03b5C + \u03c4 ) , C3 = (1 \u2212 \u03bb) \u03c4\u03b5C (\u03b2M)2\u03c4uB N (\u03c4\u03b5C + \u03c4 ) , C4 = 0,\nN = \u03bb\u03c4\u03b5C + (1 \u2212 \u03bb) \u03c4\u03b5C \u03c4\n\u03c4\u03b5C + \u03c4 , N = \u03bb\u03c4\u03b5C + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\n\u03c4\u03b5C \u03c4\n\u03c4\u03b5C + \u03c4 ,\n\u03c4 = \u03c4\u03b82 + (\u03b2M) 2 \u03c4uB + (\u03bb\u03c4\u03b5C ) 2 \u03c4uC .\nThus, we have:\nE [vB |\u03b82, pA, pB, pC ] = \u03b82 + (\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5A) 2 \u03c4uAzA\n\u03c4\u03b81 + (\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5A) 2\u03c4uA\n,\nVar [vB |\u03b82, pA, pB, pC ] = ( \u03c4\u03b81 + (\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5A ) 2 \u03c4uA )\u22121 + (\u03c4\u03b5B ) \u22121, E [vC |pA, pB, pC ] = [ \u03b2 ( \u03c4\u03b81 + (\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5A) 2\u03c4uA )]2 \u03c4uBzB + (\u03bb\u03c4\u03b5C ) 2\u03c4uC zC\n\u03c4 ,\nVar [vC |pA, pB, pC ] = \u03c4\u22121 + \u03c4\u22121\u03b5C . (14)\nProof Note that the information set {\u03b81, pA, pB, pC} and {\u03b81} are equal when solving for the conditional expectation E [\u03b81 |\u2022 ], according to the lemma in the Appendix, it is not difficult to compute the strategies of A-informed traders, that is, XA = \u03c4\u03b5A (\u03b81 \u2212 pA) .\nWe further plug the above conditional expectation and variance into Equations (2) and (4), and obtain the following results:\nXB = \u03c4\u03b5B\n( M\u03b82 + \u03c4\u03b5B (\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5A) 2\u03c4uAzA ) \u2212 \u03c4\u03b5B MpB\n\u03c4\u03b5B + M ,\nYC =\n( (\u03b2M)2\u03c4uB zB + (\u03bb\u03c4\u03b5C ) 2 \u03c4uC zC ) \u03c4\u03b5C \u2212 \u03c4\u03b5C \u03c4pC\n\u03c4\u03b5C + \u03c4 .\nPlugging traders\u2019 strategies into the market clearing conditions (5), (6) and (7), we immediately derive the equilibrium prices.\nProposition 1 shows that the equilibrium price will reveal the fundamental value aggregated by the informed traders as well as the noise trading. It is obvious that in our model the statistic of pA (zA) will be integrated into the price of asset B (zB) which will be reflected in the price of asset C by observing the other assets\u2019 prices. The price integration process is in line with the contagion mechanism in Figure 1.\nAs is defined (see Cespa and Foucault[3]), we measure the illiquidity of asset k (k = A, B, C) by the sensitivity of price pk to liquidity demand uk. Thus, we have\nLA = \u2202pA \u2202uA = 1 \u03b1\u03c4\u03b5A , (15) LB = \u2202pB \u2202uB = 1\n\u03b2 ( \u03c4\u03b81 + (\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5A ) 2 \u03c4uA\n) = 1\n\u03b2 ( \u03c4\u03b81 + (1/LA) 2 \u03c4uA ) , (16)\nLC = \u2202pC \u2202uC\n= (\u03c4\u03b5C + \u03c4) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u03bb\u03c42\u03b5C \u03c4uC\nN (\u03c4\u03b5C + \u03c4 )\n= 1\n\u03c4\u03b5C + (1 \u2212 \u03bb) (1 + \u03bb\u03c4\u03b5C \u03c4uC ) \u03bb\u03c4\u03b5C + \u03c4\u03b82 + (1/LB) 2 \u03c4uB + (\u03bb\u03c4\u03b5C ) 2 \u03c4uC . (17)\nAbove equations describe the expression of illiquidity with respect to the three assets, respectively. In the following part, we will make some comparative statics of the illiquidity as for the agent masses.\nProposition 2 The masses of the informed traders have a negative effect on illiquidity, that is, \u2202LA\u2202\u03b1 < 0, \u2202LB \u2202\u03b1 < 0, \u2202LB \u2202\u03b2 < 0, \u2202LC \u2202\u03b1 < 0, \u2202LC \u2202\u03b2 < 0.\nThe effect of the masses of informed traders on the illiquidity through two ways. The first is the direct effect, as shown in the literature (Grossman and Stiglitz[7]; Vives[14]), illiquidity (the reciprocal of market depth) is negatively related to the masses of the informed traders or the information precision of informed traders. Hence, increasing the masses of A-informed traders (B-informed traders) will decrease the illiquidity of asset A (asset B). The second is the indirect effect, increasing the masses of A-informed (B-informed) traders has a negative effect on the illiquidity of asset B (asset C). This can occur because increasing the masses of A-informed traders has a positive effect on price informativeness of asset A, which will give rise to high information precision of B-informed traders when learning from pA and further lead to low illiquidity of asset B. Same explanation for the variation of the illiquidity of asset C.\nProposition 3 (Comovement effect) \u2202LB\u2202LA > 0, \u2202LC \u2202LB > 0. This proof is obvious in above equations. Among the three assets, an increase in the illiquidity of asset A will make asset B more illiquid, which can eventually trigger an increase in illiquidity for asset C. Proposition 3 shows that illiquidity exhibits positive interaction among the three risky assets no matter whether asset fundamentals are relevant or not if cross-asset learning prices is available. The following examples in Figure 2 describe this comovement effect as for the illiquidity.\nProposition 4 \u2202LB \u2202\u03c4uA < 0, \u2202LC\u2202\u03c4uA < 0.\nProposition 4 shows that the initial high volatility of noise trading (\u03c4uA low) shock can engender a final liquidity decline (LB, LC increase) via the intermediate asset B. Through\ncross-asset learning, noise trading in asset A will be infused into the price of asset B which can be further learned by C-traders. This negative impact is an explanation for the financial contagion of the COVID-19 shock, when market is impacted by the bad news, traders need to liquidate their assets to obtain cash and avoid loss from the downward price, leading to the pessimistic sentiment and high volatility of noise trading (\u03c4uA decreases). Through our contagion mechanism, the initial noise trading shock will result in a negative effect on liquidity.\nRemark 1 Increasing the number of A-informed traders augments the trading intensity of B-informed traders.\nAccording to (2), the trading intensity in term of B-informed traders towards their private information \u03b82 can be given as:\n1 Var [\u03b81 |\u03b82, pA, pB, pC ] + \u03c4\u22121\u03b5B\n= [(\n\u03c4\u03b81 + (\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5A ) 2\u03c4uA )\u22121 + \u03c4\u22121\u03b5B ]\u22121 .\nWhen \u03b1 increases, B-informed traders face less fundamental risk about \u03b81, thus taking more aggressively strategies towards their information.\nRemark 2 Increasing the mass of A-informed traders weakens the uncertainty of \u03b82 in pB, that is \u2202(Var[\u03b82|pB ])\u2202\u03b1 < 0. As shown in Remark 1, \u03b1 increases, B-informed traders will trade more aggressively to \u03b82, as a result, more information about \u03b82 will be revealed in pB.\nAs standard in the literature (e.g., Vives[5]; Mondria, et al.[15]), we can use the precision 1 Var(v|prices) of stock payoff conditional on its prices to measure \u201cprice informativeness\u201d (or \u201cmarket efficiency\u201d, \u201cinformation efficiency\u201d,\u201cprice efficiency\u201d). We define price informativeness of assets A and C as IA = [Var (vA |pA, pB, pC )]\u22121 and IC = [Var (vC |pA, pB, pC )]\u22121. As shown in (12), we have the following results.\nProposition 5 (a) \u2202IC \u2202\u03b1 > 0, \u2202IC \u2202\u03b2 > 0 ; (b) \u2202IC \u2202\u03c4uA > 0, \u2202IC\u2202\u03c4uB > 0. Proof According to (12), we obtain\nIC =\n((\n\u03c4\u03b82 + [ \u03b2 ( \u03c4\u03b81 + (\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5A) 2 \u03c4uA )]2 \u03c4uB + (\u03bb\u03c4\u03b5C ) 2 \u03c4uC )\u22121 + \u03c4\u22121\u03b5C )\u22121 > 0.\nBy derivation, the results hold. The above results are intuitive. According to Remark 1, a high proportion of A-informed traders will give rise to high trading intensity of \u03b82, and thus more information about \u03b82 will be injected into pB , which therefore leads to high price informativeness of asset C. It is then not difficult to find increasing the mass of B-informed traders can also result in high price informativeness of asset C since asset B and C share common fundamental factor. Hence, through our contagion mechanism, raising the informed trading of asset A will generate high price informativeness of asset B, and eventually induce high price informativeness of asset C.\nWhen the noise trading of asset A is in high volatility, through this contagion mechanism, price informativeness about asset B tends to be low, ultimately resulting in low price informativeness about asset C.\nProposition 6 \u2202IC \u2202LA < 0, \u2202IC\u2202LB < 0, \u2202IC \u2202LC < 0.\nProof Combing (12) with (14) and (15), we have\nIC =\n((\n\u03c4\u03b82 + ( \u03b2 ( \u03c4\u03b81 + (1/LA) 2 \u03c4uA ))2 \u03c4uB + (\u03bb\u03c4\u03b5C ) 2 \u03c4uC )\u22121 + \u03c4\u22121\u03b5C\n)\u22121\n= (( \u03c4\u03b82 + (LB) \u22122\u03c4uB + (\u03bb\u03c4\u03b5C ) 2\u03c4uC )\u22121 + \u03c4\u22121\u03b5C )\u22121\n=\n(( (1 \u2212 \u03bb) (1 + \u03bb\u03c4\u03b5C \u03c4uC )\nLC \u2212 \u03c4\u22121\u03b5C \u2212 \u03bb\u03c4\u03b5C\n)\u22121 + \u03c4\u22121\u03b5C )\u22121 .\nBy derivation, we obtain the above results. Intuitively, high illiquidity will make the trading harder and therefore prevent new information from being incorporated into price, causing low price informativeness. Figure 3 offers an intuitive description of such relationship.\nConversely, price informativeness also has a negative impact on illiquidity, i.e., \u2202LB/\u2202IA < 0, \u2202LC/\u2202IA < 0. The negative interaction between illiquidity and price informativeness is a key driver of market crisis. In fact, assets value may be determined by various fundamental factors[16] which may generate a series of cross interactions as the above description. Hence, once the initial asset crises are triggered, the downward price may feed the panicky mind-set, which can further create a shock for illiquidity and price informativeness. Under our contagion mechanism, this inter-feedback from illiquidity and price informativeness is therefore the source of liquidity crisis, prompting the occurrence of financial crisis across the whole market (see Figure 4)."

The coefficient \u03c1 increase implies that more informed information \u03b81 will be incorporated into pA. Therefore, the price informativeness of asset A will increase, and this will further enhance the price informativeness of asset C based on Proposition 5.

            "text": "Advanced information technology and close inter-market linkage enable traders to learn information contained in the prices of assets. Our model shows that rational traders can update their expectations using the available private information and price information which bridges multiple assets via cross fundamentals. By this means, prices provide a way that transmits fundamental risk and noise trading risk. This makes the liquidity of various securities more mutually connected: 1) An initial shock in the illiquidity can have a positive effect on the illiquidity of the assets; 2) The drop in liquidity occurs jointly with the decrease in price informativeness.\nAs described above, our results suggest a potential explanations for market crisis. As a matter of fact, when extreme volatility happens in stock prices, market participants who provide liquidity may widen their quotes or stop providing liquidity. If this happens, prices of other assets would not be reliable as the information, but be a pessimistic noisy signal, finally triggering a chain reaction and leading to large liquidity crash across the whole market."
