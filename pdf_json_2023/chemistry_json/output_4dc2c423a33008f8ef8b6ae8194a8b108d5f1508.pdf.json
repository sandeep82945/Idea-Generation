View Article Online interface with low interfacial impedance via tunning electrolyte components,16,17 introducing electrolyte additives,7,18 and covering the anode with an articial protective layer.19,20\nRecently, constructing an articial SEI layer has attracted extensive attention, due to the advantageous simplicity in the preparation process and efficacy in suppressing dendrite growth. Typically, the protective lms are composed of inorganic insulators,21,22 inorganic ion conductors,23\u201326 Li alloys,27\u201330 polymers,31\u201333 or composites.19,47 Inorganic protective lms like Al2O3 (ref. 21) and Li3PO4 (ref. 24) with a high Young's modulus can effectively prevent the penetration of Li dendrites; however, the thin inorganic lms tend to become pulverized, due to the poor exibility and the rapidly accumulated internal stress, induced by the large volume evolution aer multiple Li stripping/depositing cycles. Alternatively, the polymer lm seems a good choice considering its high elasticity, lmforming properties and easy synthesis. Polymers like polyvinyl alcohol (PVA),33 hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC),34 and b-phase polyvinylidene diuoride (b-PVDF)35 with large quantities of polar functional groups, enable strong interaction with Li ions (Li+), guiding uniform Li deposition. Wu and co-workers demonstrated a highly tight PVA layer on the Cu/Li surface to realize a dense deposition of Li without grain boundaries and voids, induced by the connement effect and lithiophilic feature of PVA coating.32 Similarly, Cao's group introduced a viscoelastic HPMC interlayer with excellent lithiophilicity and electrochemical and mechanical stability, enabling dendritefree and zero volume expansion Li anodes.34 Nevertheless, the relatively low ionic conductivity of most polymer lms limits the electrochemical performance of Li metal anodes, especially at high current density.36,37 In line with this, the inorganic species are oen incorporated into the polymer lms as llers. For instance, adding LiF particles to poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO),38 introducing Li bis-triuoromethyl sulfonate (LiTFSI) salt into polyethylene vinyl alcohol-b-acrylonitrile ether (EBC),20 and joining Cu3N nanoparticles to styrene butadiene rubber (SBR)39 have been reported as effective synergised interlayers for Li anodes. Despite this, the detachment of the articial protective layer during long cycles, resulting from the low binding ability between the coating lm and Li metal, is still a major challenge yet to be solved. Generally, polymer lms like polyacrylic acid (PAA),40 pentanoic acid,6 pendant PEO segments and ureidopyrimidinone (UPy)41 with strong binding ability, can in situ react with Li metal. One can expect that the combination of desired properties including high binding ability, strong Li+ homogenizing capability and superior ionic conductivity in the designed integrated protection layer could effectively resolve the issues of Li dendrite growth, volume change and side reactions.\nHerein, we rationally design an articial hybrid protective layer composed of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and PAA via a one-step in situ reaction. PVA with sufficient hydroxyl groups can rmly bond with Li atoms to avoid the ion agglomeration around Li protrusions and achieve even Li deposition. Meanwhile, PVA is a widely used synthetic polymer with low-cost, and excellent thermal, mechanical, and chemical stabilities, coupled with good lm-forming properties.32,39,41 Unfortunately, the relatively low ionic\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nconductivity and inferior binding ability with Li metal of PVA can retard the Li+ transportation under high current density and induce shortened lifespan of LMBs. Alternatively, PAA can in situ react with Li metal to form highly stretchable and favourable ionic conducting lithium polyacrylic acid (LiPAA) showing enhanced contact with Li metal and excellent stability, consequently adapting to volumetric change over multiple Li dissolution/ deposition processes.43\u201345 Accordingly, by mixing PVA and PAA as an articial protective layer, the advantages of uniform Li+ ux from PVA coupled with favourable Li+ conductivity and robust binding ability of LiPAA are synergized. Therefore, when such a hybrid polymer lm is applied in symmetric LijLi cells at various current densities, the cell exhibits enhanced cycling stability (700 h at 3 mA cm\u22122/1 mA h cm\u22122) in a carbonate ester-based electrolyte without any additive. While the PVA\u2013PAA lm is coated on the Cu current collector, LijCu cells can smoothly cycle for 200 cycles under 3 mA cm\u22122/1 mA h cm\u22122 with a high coulombic efficiency (CE) of 97.5%. Our modied Li anode can readily resist the volume uctuation and prevent dendrite growth over long cycling. In addition, when paired with a high areal loading LiFePO4 cathode (about 2.45 mA h cm\n\u22122), the LijLiFeO4 cell with a PVA\u2013PAA coated Li anode displays a long lifespan of 180 cycles at 1.0 C, with a low-capacity decay percentage of 3.3%."

The PVA\u2013PAA layer on Li foil can be spontaneously produced by drop casting the PVA\u2013PAA solution dissolved in DMSO with a mass fraction of 1 wt%, followed by natural evaporation in a glove box (Fig. 1a). With such a hybrid lm coated on the Li foil surface, Li+ ux can be effectively homogenized, leading to smooth deposition behaviours, whilst the dendrite gradually grows on bare Li foil (Fig. 1b). Fig. 2a and b show the optical and SEM images of Cu foils with and without PVA\u2013PAA coating. The colour of the Cu foil turns brown and the surface becomes smoother aer casting PVA\u2013PAA, as compared to bare Cu. The cross-sectional SEM image in Fig. 2c reveals that the thickness of the PVA\u2013PAA protection layer on Cu foil is around 1.20 mm. Upon casting the PVA\u2013PAA foil, the modied Li foil exhibits a glossier texture with a brighter colour and even surface (Fig. 2d and e). The thickness of the PVA\u2013PAA protection layer on Li foil is also around 1.20 mm, as shown in Fig. 2f,\n5096 | Nanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 5094\u20135101\nindicating that the reaction between metallic Li and PAA has no impact on the lm thickness.\nThe proportion of PVA and PAA as well as thickness of the coating layer are vital indices for the electrochemical performance of the PVA\u2013PAA hybrid lm in ester electrolyte. Therefore, a series of PVA\u2013PAA mixtures in various weight ratios (PVA : PAA = 1 : 0; 8 : 1; 4 : 1; 2 : 1; 1 : 4; 0 : 1) were dissolved in DMSO under a weight percentage of 1 wt%.

When a small amount of PAA is added to PVA (PAA : PVA = 1 : 8), the cycling behaviour was signicantly improved, due to the addition of PVA giving rising to LiPAA with relatively high ionic conductivity.42\u201344 The optimal electrochemical performance can be observed (CE: 98.5% aer 300 cycles at 1 mA cm\u22122, 1 mA h cm\u22122), when the weight ratio of PVA to PAA increases to 4 : 1. However, as the weight of PAA further increased, the length of the cycling period was lowered.

Hence, the weight ratio of 4 : 1 was selected as the optimal parameter, as both decent ionic conductivity and distributed Li+ ux can be synergized in the ultimate robust hybrid PVA\u2013PAA lm. When increasing the current to 3 mA cm\u22122, the PVA\u2013PAA layer with a weight ratio of 4 : 1 also exceled its counterparts (Fig. S1b\u2020). Subsequently, Cu foil cast with PVA\u2013PAA of different thickness was measured to investigate the appropriate coating thickness (PVA\u2013PAA-1, PVA\u2013PAA-2, PVA\u2013PAA-3, and PVA\u2013PAA-4). Clearly, the cycling lifespan of PVA\u2013PAA-2@Cu foil was longer, as compared to its counterparts (Fig. S2\u2020). The overthin layer tends to contain defects inside the structure, failing to isolate the electrolyte and resist the volume change over cycling. The over-thick coating layer may lead to insufcient structural integrity, and the consequent over-long transport path of ions could reduce the evenness of Li deposition.\nUpon the optimization of preparation parameters, the CE of bare Cu foil, PVA, PAA and PAA\u2013PVA (1 : 4) coated Cu foil was evaluated at a current density of 1 mA cm\u22122 and areal capacity of 1 mA h cm\u22122. Prior to the test, the ionic conductivity of different coating layers was evaluated with the precursor solution drop casting on stainless steel. 20 mL of ester solution was applied as the supporting electrolyte. As exhibited in Fig. S3,\u2020 the ionic conductivity of the ester electrolyte was higher (3.18 \u00d7 10\u22124 S cm\u22121), as compared to PAA (1.06 \u00d7 10\u22124 S cm\u22121), PVA (1.59 \u00d7 10\u22126 S cm\u22121) and PAA\u2013PVA lms (5.03 \u00d7 10\u22125 S cm\u22121). The resistance in the high frequency range in Fig. S4\u2020 also followed the trend in Fig. S3\u2020 (PVA > PVA\u2013PAA > PAA > liquid electrolyte). The thickness of the coating layer over the test is about 1.20 mm. Distinctly, the incorporation of PAA can improve the ionic conductivity of the PVA layer, favourable for the fast transport of Li+ and subsequent homogeneous growth. Additionally, the stress\u2013 strain proles of PVA and PVA\u2013PAA lms are shown in Fig. S5.\u2020 As compared to the PVA lm, the coating layer of the PVA\u2013PAA lm was markedly more stretchable (289% strain to its initial length), effectively adapting to the volume uctuation without brittle fracture.42,44\nFrom Fig. 3a and b, the LijCu cell can only cycle for 120 and 40 cycles, respectively, at 1 mA cm\u22122/1 mA h cm\u22122 and 3 mA cm\u22122/1 mA h cm\u22122, as the non-uniform deposition of Li on pure Cu can induce the formation of dendrites and dead Li, thereby resulting in short cycle life and low CE. Aer coating the PVA lm with the function of uniform Li+ ux on the Cu foil, it can cycle stably for 220 and 90 cycles at 1 mA cm\u22122/ 1 mA h cm\u22122 and 3 mA cm\u22122/1 mA h cm\u22122, respectively. In stark contrast, the PVA\u2013PAA casted Cu foil can smoothly operate for 300 (98.5%) and 200 (97.5%) cycles, respectively, under 1 mA cm\u22122/1 mA h cm\u22122 and 3 mA cm\u22122/1 mA h cm\u22122, demonstrating enhanced cycling stability as compared to the counterpart. Additionally, the CE of the as-prepared hybrid PVA\u2013PAA was tested in ester electrolyte, as exhibited in Fig. S6,\u2020 where the CE of protected Cu foil clearly outperformed that of bare Cu foil. Such improvement can be attributed to the superior Li+ transmission and distribution capability of the hybrid PAA\u2013PVA lm, enabling fast and\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The inferior capacities of Cu foil and PAA\u2013PVA@Cu in the 1st cycle were due to the generation of a SEI and LiPAA, respectively. In the remaining cycling, the occurrence of parasitic reactions and dead Li on bare Cu consumed a large amount of active Li, whilst PAA\u2013 PVA casted Cu foil can inhibit the side reactions and enable homogeneous Li nucleation. Furthermore, the relatively high charge capacity and low polarisation voltage of the cell with PAA\u2013PVA coated Cu foil aer 200 cycles, in compared to Cu, suggest a stabilised interface induced by the hybrid polymer coating.\nIn order to explore the inuence of PVA\u2013PAA coating on the behaviour of Li deposition, a capacity of 5 mA h cm\u22122 Li was\nNanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 5094\u20135101 | 5097\nFig. 5 Cycle performances of symmetric cells based on PVA, PVA\u2013 PAA, PAA coated Li and bare Li at current densities of (a) 1 mA cm\u22122 and (b) 3 mA cm\u22122 with a fixed capacity of 1 mA h cm\u22122.

As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the Li deposition on Cu foil was very uneven and ends up in dendritic formation. From the cross-sectional view in Fig. 4c and S7,\u2020 the thickness of Li deposition on bare Cu was about 64 mm, much larger than the theoretical thickness (25 mm), suggestive of a loose structure of deposited Li. In contrast, the deposited Li on the PVA\u2013PAA coated Cu foil shows a at coating surface with dense Li growth below (the thickness is 25 mm, Fig. 4d\u2013f). This indicates that Li+ can transport though the PVA\u2013PAA polymer layer and distribute homogeneously to achieve uniform nucleation and dissolution behaviours, thereby suppressing dendrite growth and buffering dimensional variation. Furthermore, the deposited Li was electrochemically extracted from the coated Cu electrode under the same conditions. From the SEM image in Fig. S8,\u2020 the coating layer on Cu foil returned to the original state, and becomes smoother and atter aer the Li extraction, due to the reaction between PAA and Li. This indicates that such a mechanically robust lm can induce uniform deposition of Li and resist the volume change in the subsequent cycling process.\nThe application of the hybrid PAA\u2013PVA polymer layer directly on Li metal was also investigated via a symmetric cell conguration. Similarly, the coating layer thickness on Li foil was assessed upon adjusting the drop volume of precursor solution to explore the optimal parameter. Under a current density of 3 mA cm\u22122 with a xed capacity of 1 mA h cm\u22122 in carbonate-based electrolyte, the symmetric cell of PVA\u2013PAA30 on Li foil maintained a longer cycling period and smaller polarization hysteresis, in comparison to the reference cells (Fig. S9\u2020). Hence, a dose of 30 mL was chosen as the optimal condition for modifying the surface of Li foil, with a thickness of 1.2 mm, equalling the optimal thickness of the coating on Cu foil. An equivalent circuit (Fig. S10a\u2020 inset) was used to t these impedance spectra using ZView soware. The RS, Rf, and RCT respectively stand for the bulk resistance of the cell, surface passivation layer, and charge-transfer process.46,47 The tting results of overall resistance are displayed in Table S1.\u2020 The initial impedance of the LijLi symmetric cell was 415.2 U. Aer 50 cycles, the impedance reduces to 175.1 U, due to the activation process, and then gradually increases in the subsequent cycles (100th cycle: 190.0 U; 200th cycle: 253.7 U). The underneath reasons lie in the brittle original SEI continuing to crack and grow during the cycle, resulting in non-uniform current distribution and high Li+ ux near cracks. The growth of dendrite Li and accumulation of dead Li exhibit high impedance, as shown in the Nyquist plot. Despite markedly large initial impedance of the PVA\u2013PAA coated LijLi symmetric cell (762.4 U) in the 1st cycle, as compared to the LijLi cell, due to relatively low conductivity of the coating layer in contrast to liquid electrolyte, the modied cell maintained a stable small impedance in the following circulation (95.1, 88.1 and 93.2 U in the 50th, 100th and 200th cycles, respectively). The steadied trend of resistance of the modied Li cell can directly suggest the successfully in-built robust lm on the anode surface, which can distribute Li+ ux rapidly and homogeneously to resist the dimensional expansion and dendritic growth. As shown in Fig. 5a and b and S11,\u2020 the\n5098 | Nanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 5094\u20135101\nvoltage hysteresis of the pure LijLi symmetric cell increased signicantly when cycling to 120 h, and a short circuit occurred at 260 h. In contrast, the coated Li\u2016Li cell shows boosted long-cycle performance of stable operation for 700 and 250 h under 1 mA cm\u22122/1 mA h cm\u22122 and 3 mA cm\u22122/ 1 mA h cm\u22122, respectively. Additionally, the largest polarization hysteresis of the symmetric cell with PVA coating validates the inadequate ionic conductivity of PVA, unable to rapidly transport Li+, particularly under high current density. The cycling behaviours were consistent with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data in Fig. S10 and Table S1.\u2020 There are three possible causes for such observation: (i) the ne coating layer can provide a stable interface in between the Li surface and electrolyte, to regulate the Li+ ux and prevent side reactions; (ii) the favourable ionic conductivity of the hybrid lm can ensure the rapid transmission of Li+, instead of local accumulation; (iii) the PVA\u2013PAA layer with a high binding ability between the coating layer and Li metal, coupled with considerable mechanical strength and exibility, can guarantee the tight contact of the polymer lm and anode, and well adapt to volume changes during long cycles. Those synergistic effects can enable rational Li nucleation/ dissolution behaviour and consequently long lifespan.\nThe outstanding performances of PVA\u2013PAA coated Li in symmetric cells demonstrate its high feasibility in practical cells. Herein, a commercial LiFeO4 cathode with an areal capacity of 2.45 mA h cm\u22122 was adopted to pair with the PVA\u2013 PAA coated Li anode. As shown in Fig. 5c, the PVA\u2013PAA coated LijLFP cell delivered a high reversible capacity of 148.2 mA h g\u22121 at 1.0 C (1.92 mA cm\u22122) and maintained a discharge capacity of 124.8 mA h g\u22121 aer 180 cycles, with a retention rate of 96.7%.

The Galvanostatic charge/discharge curves in Fig. S12\u2020 showed the polarization voltage of the LijLFP cell markedly increased aer multiple cycles, probably due to the accumulation of dead Li impeding the transfer of Li at the interfaces, and resulting in low CE and fast capacity decay. The rate performances of the full cells were measured at different current densities (Fig. 5d). The modied LijLFP cell delivered a higher specic capacity of 147.8, 143.1, 135.8, 130.4, and 121.2 mA h g\u22121 respectively at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 C, in comparison to the LijLFP cell (145.2, 142.5, 138.5, 125.2, and 111.3 mA h g\u22121 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 C, respectively). The increased capacity difference of the two cells along with the rise of applied current suggests the generation of dendrites and dead Li on unmodied Li can aggravate the uneven deposition of Li, particularly at a high rate.\nTo further illustrate the role of the PVA\u2013PAA protective layer, post-mortem SEM images were collected to study the morphology of the Li metal anode aer 50 cycles at a current density of 1 mA cm\u22122 with a xed capacity of 1 mA h cm\u22122. From Fig. 6a\u2013c, vast quantities of dendrites and dead Li were formed on the uncoated Li metal anode, caused by uneven Li deposition and serious side-reactions between Li metal and electrolyte. In contrast, the surface of modied Li anode revealed a at and dense texture, with the PVA\u2013PAA lm tightly coating on the top, effectively isolating the electrolyte and offering a stabilized interface (Fig. 6d\u2013f).\nThe structural evolutions of bare Li and PVA\u2013PAA coated Li are displayed in Fig. 7 to demonstrate the protection mechanism of the functional polymer layer. Owing to the nature of high reactivity and ultralow reduction potential, Li metal tends to interact with the electrolyte to form an SEI layer in the initial cycle. During Li plating, the uneven distribution of Li+ ux and the rough electrode surface can cause nonuniform Li deposition and dendrite growth. The accompanying large dimensional uctuation would rupture the fragile SEI and expose fresh Li, which can further react with the electrolyte to form a new SEI. Such a process of continuous cracking and repair of the SEI would repeat in the subsequent\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

In the end, the Li anode will become porous or even pulverized. In stark contrast, when PVA\u2013PAA was applied as an articial SEI on the top of Li surface, the above-mentioned challenges could be addressed. The superior Li+ distribution capability, the decent mechanical strength and good lm-forming properties of PVA as well as good ionic conductivity and tight contact with Li metal of PAA were rationally incorporated in the hybrid lm. Hence, the PVA\u2013PAA layer can enable strong binding with the Li anode, homogeneous Li+ ux and a rapid Li+ transportation rate, achieving uniform and compact deposition of Li without dendrite formation and volume uctuation."

            "text": "In summary, we have successfully demonstrated that the asprepared PVA\u2013PAA hybrid coating layer can effectively stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface and inhibit the growth of Li dendrites. Therefore, a large deposition of Li (5 mA h cm\u22122) on coated Cu foil can obtain a uniform and dense electrode. The LijCu half cells can stably cycle for 300 cycles at 1 mA cm\u22122/1 mA h cm\u22122, with a high CE of 98.5%. The symmetric cell with PVA\u2013PAA coating can continuously operate for 250 h at a high current of 3 mA cm\u22122 under an areal capacity of 1 mA h cm\u22122. In addition, when applied to commercial LFP cathodes, the PVA\u2013PAA@LijLFP cell displayed excellent rate and cycling performances (180 cycles at 1.0 C with a capacity retention of 96.66%; 121.2 mA h g\u22121 at 2.0 C). The reasons behind the phenomena are as follows: (1) the PVA\u2013PAA coating layer can isolate the electrolyte and reactive Li metal to prevent side-reactions and over-consumption of active materials; (2) the PVA\u2013PAA coating layer can induce uniform Li+ ow and promote Li+ transmission, ensuring uniform Li nucleation/dissolution; (3) the PVA\u2013PAA coating layer possesses high binding ability to closely combine with Li and alleviate the dimensional variation over multiple cycles. Consequently, a dense Li anode with dendrite-free morphology can be achieved even aer long-term cycling. In short, using such a multifunctional articial protective layer can be a promising strategy to address the non-uniform deposition and dendrite growth in the anode of practical LMBs.\nNanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 5094\u20135101 | 5099"
