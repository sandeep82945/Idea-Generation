We are interested in the large-\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50 limit of these theories, for which standard lattice techniques are limited by highcomputational costs. Our approach makes use of the well-established twisted volume reduction, which allows one to simulate these theories on a 14 lattice. In this talk, we are going to present a detailed study of the scale setting of these theories, performed with Wilson flow techniques, but endowed with a procedure that allowed us to reduce finite-volume (finite \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50) systematic effects. We will apply this procedure to our configurations for \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 = 0, 12 , 1, 2 and analyze the dependence of the scale on the coupling, the adjoint fermion mass and the number of flavours. For the cases in which enough couplings are available we compared the resulting \ud835\udefd-function with the predictions of perturbation theory, finding very good agreement.\nThe 39th International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory, LATTICE2022 6th-13th August, 2022 Bonn, Germany\n\u2217Speaker\n\u00a9 Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0). https://pos.sissa.it/\nP o S ( L A T T I C E 2 0 2 2 ) 3 6 5"

As an example, the case of \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 = 12 (one adjoint Majorana fermion), corresponds to N = 1 SUSY Yang-Mills which shares several non-trivial properties with QCD, while maintaining minimal supersymmetry. On the other hand, the case of \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 = 1 (one adjoint Dirac fermion) is of high relevance for BSM models and the study of condensed matter systems, and that of \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 = 2 (two adjoint Dirac fermions) is a valuable test case for conformality. The most interesting regime of these theories is at strong coupling where they manifest many non-trivial phenomena, depending on their matter content.\nWe are interested in the study of the large-\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50 limit of these theories and our approach makes use of volume reduction using twisted boundary conditions [1, 2]. This methodology is a wellestablished technique that allows one to simulate gauge theory on a single site lattice and it has already been applied in the past in the context of pure Yang-Mills theory [3, 4], with dynamical \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 = 1, 2 adjoint Dirac fermions [5, 6] and recently for \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 = 12 [7]. In this talk, we will first review general concepts of twisted volume reduction. Next we will go through the methodology we developed to perform scale setting. Our setup allows us to have control over the systematic effects related to finite-volume (finite-\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50), including the case of small fermion masses. We will then present the results of applying the method to large \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50 configurations involving various flavours of dynamical adjoint fermions. This will allow us to analyze the dependence of the scale on the various parameters including the quark masses. Interesting conclusions will then be drawn concerning scaling and the comparison of our results with the perturbative \ud835\udefd-function."

(4)\nThe lattice version of the flow equations are integrated with respect to the lattice flow time \ud835\udc47 = \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc4e2 . In the following, we will consider the dimensionless version of the flowed energy density normalized to the number of colours, \u03a6(\ud835\udc47) = \u27e8\ud835\udc47\n2\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc47 )\u27e9 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50\n. After the flowed energy density is calculated, a scale can be defined by choosing a reference value \ud835\udc60 and then solving the following implicit equation\n\u03a6(\ud835\udc47) \ud835\udc47=\ud835\udc47 (\ud835\udc60) \u2261 1 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50\n\u2329 \ud835\udc472\ud835\udc38 (\ud835\udc47) \u232a \ud835\udc47=\ud835\udc47 (\ud835\udc60) = \ud835\udc60. (5)\nThe standard choice for the reference scale in QCD simulations is \ud835\udc60 = \ud835\udc600 \u2261 0.11, whose relative scale will be called \ud835\udc470, but also other values of \ud835\udc60 can be adopted. In particular, the choice \ud835\udc60 = \ud835\udc601 \u2261 0.05 produces a scale \ud835\udc471 that results to be less affected by finite-volume effects while still being safe from lattice artefacts. In the left side of Fig. 1 we display the flow curves for several values of \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50 for the case of pure Yang-Mills (\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 = 0) at \ud835\udc4f = 0.37, where the two reference scales \ud835\udc600 = 0.1 and \ud835\udc601 = 0.05 are depicted with corresponding horizontal grey lines. As it is evident from the magnification in the plot, each curve corresponding to a different \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50 intersects the line corresponding to \ud835\udc601 at a different value of the lattice flow time \ud835\udc47 . In general, one could attempt an extrapolation of the scale to \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50 \u2192 \u221e, but several values of \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50 would be needed to have good control over the quality of the extrapolation. Since in most of our simulations we just have 2 or 3 values of \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50 available, we adopted another strategy. In [7] we analyzed in detail the source of these \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50 dependence effects and developed a method that we applied to the case of \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 = 12 . In the following subsection, we will give a general indication of how this method is implemented, referring to [7] for further technical details.\n1Note that in standard lattice QCD simulations the dimensionless flowed energy density is not divided by the number of colours as we do in Eq. (5), therefore our \ud835\udc470 for \ud835\udc60 = 0.1 corresponds to \ud835\udc60 = 0.3 in QCD simulations.\nP o S ( L A T T I C E 2 0 2 2 ) 3 6 5\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 t a2\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.10\n0.12\n\u03a6 (T ,N\nc)\nNc = 169 Nc = 289 Nc = 361 Nc = 529 Nc = 625\n2.5 3.0 0.045\n0.050\n0.055\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 t a2\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.10\n0.12\n\u03a6\u0302 (t\n)\nNc = 625\nNc = 529\nNc = 361\nNc = 289\nNc = 169\n2.1 2.2 2.3\n0.0475\n0.0500\n0.0525\nFigure 1: Left-hand side: Flowed dimensionless energy density for pure Yang-Mills for different numbers of colours at \ud835\udc4f = 0.37.

The main observation is that, as analyzed in detail in [8], lattice perturbation theory at LO states that the \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50 dependence of \u03a6(\ud835\udc47, \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50) is given by an overall coefficient that can be computed analytically N\ud835\udc3f (\ud835\udc47, \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50) and whose expression can be found in Eq. (B.10) in Ref. [7]. In light of this, one can employ a modified version of \u03a6(\ud835\udc47), given by\n\u03a6\u0302(\ud835\udc47) = 3 128\ud835\udf0b4\nN\ud835\udc3f (\ud835\udc47, \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50) \u03a6(\ud835\udc47, \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50) (6)\nwhere the number 3128\ud835\udf0b4 is the analytic value of the overall coefficient in the continuum and in the \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50 \u2192 \u221e limit, as known from [9]. This modification takes into account both finite-\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50 effects and lattice artefacts to LO in perturbation theory. This method is expected to work within a scaling window, whose lower bound is determined by limiting the effects of lattice artefacts and the higher bound by the validity of PT to LO and remnant finite-size effects. We define this scaling window to be\n\ud835\udc47 \u2208 [ 1.25, \ud835\udefe2 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50\n8\n] with \ud835\udefe \u223c 0.3 (7)\nwhere we empirically verify that curves do not suffer from the influence of lattice artefacts nor remnant finite volume effects. For the previously considered example of pure Yang-Mills theory at \ud835\udc4f = 0.37, the effects of the corrections are depicted on the right-hand side of Fig. 1, where each colour in the plot corresponds to a different \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50 and the different scaling windows are represented as coloured vertical bands.2 It is visible by eye that inside each scaling window all the different\n2Each coloured band starts at \ud835\udc47 = 1.25.

An important observation is that the reference value \ud835\udc601 falls inside the scaling window of all the cases (except for \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50 = 169 ), therefore \u221a 8\ud835\udc471 can be safely estimated through an interpolation. This is not true for \ud835\udc600 = 0.1, which falls out of the scaling windows (except for \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50 = 625), and therefore the scale has to be calculated with an extrapolation done by fitting our data for different values of \ud835\udc4f to a single universal curve, whose argument is \ud835\udc47/\ud835\udc471(\ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50). For this reason, we preferred to perform the scale setting of all our configurations using\n\u221a 8\ud835\udc471 instead of\u221a\n8\ud835\udc470, also having in mind that for the majority of ensembles for cases of \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 = 12 , 1, 2 we have at our disposal configurations for only smaller values of \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50 = 289, 361.\nThe numerical values for \u221a 8\ud835\udc470 and \u221a\n8\ud835\udc471 for different values of \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50 are reported in Tab. 1.

The configurations that we have used were generated earlier for other scientific purposes. Reflecting this different origin, our results allow different types of analysis. On one hand for the case of Yang-Mills (\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 = 0) and Susy Yang-Mills theory (\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 = 12 ) we have results for a large number of values of \ud835\udc4f = 1/\ud835\udf06, allowing a determination of the beta function and a study of asymptotic scaling.

In fact, the dimensionless quantity defined as \ud835\udc45 = \u221a 8\ud835\udc611\ud835\udf0e results to be compatible with a constant value 0.6589(34) for all values of the coupling. This comparison with the string tension is a remarkable confirmation of the validity of scaling for a wide range of \u2019t Hooft couplings. Furthermore, our new determination of the scale has smaller errors than the one previously extracted using the string tension. On the other hand, in the case of \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 = 12 , we only have configurations for \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc50 = 289, 361 for 4 values of the coupling \ud835\udc4f = 0.34, 0.345, 0.35, 0.36. In [7], after performing the scale setting of these configurations, we performed a linear extrapolation to obtain the value of the scale in the massless-gluino limit, which corresponds to the supersymmetric theory [10, 11]. Having the lattice spacing at several values of \ud835\udc4f for both \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 = 0 and \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 = 12 , we can extract from them the bare \ud835\udefd-function of the theory. In order to give a prediction to confront our data, we employ a parameterization of the \ud835\udefd-function which is well suited for the integration\n\ud835\udefd(\ud835\udf06) = \u2212 \ud835\udc4f0\ud835\udf06 2 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc4f1 \ud835\udc4f0 \ud835\udf06 \u2212\u2211\ud835\udc5b\u22653 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc5b\u22121 , with \ud835\udc4f0 = \u22124\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 \u2212 1124\ud835\udf0b2 and \ud835\udc4f1 = \u221216\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 \u2212 17192\ud835\udf0b4 .

It is well known that the naive coupling \ud835\udf06 does not exhibit precocious asymptotic scaling. We, therefore, use a standard improved version of the coupling \ud835\udf06\u2032, defined as [12]\n\ud835\udf06\u2032 = 1\n\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc4f) , (10)\nwhere \ud835\udc43 is the expectation value of the plaquette.

We focus on the case of \ud835\udc4f = 0.350 and 0.360 for which we have data in a large range of fermion masses at all values of \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 . Having those at our disposal, we can attempt a quantitative study of the behaviour of the corresponding theories, trying to highlight the expected substantial differences.\nOur results for the lattice spacing at \ud835\udc4f = 0.36 as a function of the subtracted (bare) quark mass, \ud835\udc4e?\u0304?\ud835\udc5e \u2261 1/(2\ud835\udf05) \u2212 1/(2\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc50) are displayed in Fig. 3. The critical value of the hopping parameter has been extracted by tuning the PCAC mass to zero, following the methodology explained in [7]; we obtain \ud835\udf05\ud835\udc50 = 0.18418(2), 0.1777(1) and 0.1698(1), for \ud835\udc4f = 0.360 and \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 = 12 , 1 and 2 respectively. The plot shows a smooth dependence of the lattice scale on the fermion mass. As expected from the decoupling of fermions in the heavy mass limit, the curves approach a unique value irrespective of the number of flavours and approximate the red band in the figure which represents the value of the scale extracted on pure gauge configurations. In the light fermion sector, our results approach different theories. The \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 = 12 case was studied in detail in a former publication [7]. We observed that \ud835\udc4e/\n\u221a 8\ud835\udc611 shows a linear behaviour in\u221a\n8\ud835\udc611\ud835\udc5apcac, leading to the scales in the chiral limit given in ref.

The case of \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 = 2, on the other hand, is known to behave differently. In fact, the theory with 2 dynamical adjoint fermions is believed to be conformal in the chiral limit. Indeed, in our previous study [6], we showed compatibility with conformality and extracted the value of the mass anomalous dimension \ud835\udefe\u2217 = 0.269(2) (50).
