 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Develop a COVID-19 specific electronic nose with sensors optimized to detect the key volatile biomarkers identified so far. Test its performance compared to existing e-noses.

2. Conduct further metabolomics studies to identify additional qualitative biomarkers produced only in COVID-19 patients. These could improve diagnosis specificity.

3. Evaluate the use of electronic noses for continuous monitoring of COVID-19 patients to assess disease progression and treatment efficacy over time. 

4. Test the feasibility of using trained dogs for early detection of COVID-19 infections in public settings like airports. Compare to electronic noses.

5. Standardize methods for COVID-19 breath biomarker analysis and build a comprehensive VOC biomarker database to support diagnosis using breath analysis techniques.
