            "text": "In the last few decades, rapid industrial progress, especially in the ne chemicals industry, has dramatically increased the occurrence of chemical-induced water pollution. Mandelic acid and its derivatives (MADs) are such a series of chiral compounds that have attracted much attention due to their wide use in the synthesis of antibiotics, antiobesity and antitumor agents, biologically active compounds and enantiomer separation.1,2 Due to their superior water solubility, the concentration of MADs is substantial in relevant wastewater, causing serious environmental problems because of their strong negative environmental impact and high toxicity.3 Considering not only environmental pollution improvement but also resource re-utilization, converting MADs into useful chemicals, i.e. aromatic aldehydes, is a much more potent alternative to direct mineralization. Aromatic aldehydes, such as p-chlorobenzaldehyde, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 4-hydroxy-3methoxybenzaldehyde, 4-hydroxy-3-ethoxybenzaldehyde, and\nl Engineering, Shanghai Institute of 201418, China.

Silica-encapsulated Cu\u2013Al hydrotalcite (SECuAlHT) was developed as an efficient catalyst to catalytically oxidize 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymandelic acid in a.q. solution under mild conditions, which gave a 72% yield of 4-hydroxy-3methoxybenzaldehyde.18 Without a doubt, the chemical oxidation efficiency towards the substrate was limited under low substrate concentration.\nConsidering that environmental pollution and the sustainable supply of green energy are the two main global challenges being faced in the current era, photocatalytic selective oxidation technology has become a focus of international attention as it has potential for development.19\u201322 Photocatalysis has been\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 5245\u20135254 | 5245\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Several aromatic aldehydes have been obtained from the corresponding alcohols by employing photocatalytic technology in the water medium at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.28 It has been widely used for the detoxication of water and the air and has become a very promising ne chemical synthesis method in recent years.29 Without a doubt, noble metal catalysts, such as Au, Ru, and Pd, can mediate efficient oxidation reactions due to the low-temperature or preferential oxidation of CO, alcohol oxidation and soot oxidation.30 However, high cost is the dominating disadvantage of noble metal-based catalysts, limiting their large-scale use. Thus, low-cost catalyst construction has immense potential. In recent decades, metalfree semiconductor polymer carbon nitride (C3N4) has attracted attention due to its unique and interesting physical and chemical properties, such as high working efficiency under visible and ultraviolet light, strong stability, non-toxicity, nonpolluting nature.31\u201334 For further improvement of the photocatalytic activity of C3N4, many strategies have been adopted, including doping with different metals, such as palladium, silver, and cobalt.35\u201338 Based on the principles of green sustainable chemistry and engineering, considerable efforts have been made to adjust the catalytic activity of C3N4 toward achieving excellent conversion and selectivity in aqueous solutions.39 Simultaneously, metal\u2013organic complexes have attracted the attention of scientists due to their excellent catalytic activity and tunable structure. Considering that C3N4 exhibits excellent electron-transition ability due to the p-conjugated system, supporting p-conjugated compounds on C3N4 has been used to develop hybrid photocatalysts for selective photocatalytic oxidation in the elds of water splitting and organic synthesis.40,41 Especially, the usage of industrial solid waste for organic ligand synthesis can further realize the resource utilization of industrial by-products. For example, 5-aldehyde vanillin (5-AV) is the typical by-product formed during the production of vanillin. The oxhydryl and aldehyde groups make it an abundantly tuneable structure (Scheme 1).\nHerein, a polydentate chelate and polymeric metal\u2013organic complex based on 5-AV, a by-product of vanillin, was constructed and doped on the surface of C3N4 (Co-L/C3N4) to achieve the selective conversion of a variety of substituted mandelic acids to aromatic aldehydes efficiently under mild photocatalytic conditions. The conversion of the substrate reached 96.3% with an 84% selectivity. More importantly, the plausible mechanism for aromatic aldehyde production was investigated by employing in situ IR and UV-vis spectroscopy.\n5246 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 5245\u20135254"

Aer cooling it to room temperature, 220 mg C3N4 was collected as a light-yellow solid.\nThen, 5-aldehyde vanillin (5.5 mmol, 1.0 g) and 1,3-diaminopropane (5.5 mmol, 0.41 g) were completely dissolved in ethanol (30mL) under vigorous stirring at 75 C and reuxed for 4 h. Aer it cooled down to room temperature, the solvent was evaporated to give ligand (L) as a white solid. The ligand (219 mg, 1 mmol) and CoCl2$6H2O (238 mg, 1 mmol) were added to EtOH (10 mL) and heated to 80 C for 3 hours. Aer they cooled down to room temperature, the solvent was removed in a vacuum to get the Co(II) complex (Co-L). A certain amount of Co-L was mixed with C3N4 uniformly and calcined at 500 C for 2 hours to obtain the Co/C3N4 catalyst (0.05 g Co-L mixed with 1 g C3N4 is denoted as Co-L/C3N4-5).\n2.2.2 Photocatalytic conversion performance of by Co-L/ C3N4. The typical procedure for testing the photocatalytic conversion performance was as follows: the freshly prepared catalyst (Co/C3N4 0.1 g) was added to an aqueous solution of mandelic acid (100 mL, 1.0%). Aer the pH value was adjusted to 11 using aqueous NaOH (30%), the mixture was bubbled with O2 under constant stirring at room temperature. Simultaneously, the mixture was irradiated with a 500 W Xe lamp for 5 hours, and the residual material was determined by HPLC.

In order to investigate the reaction clearly, the factors affecting the reactivity were considered one by one. Firstly, the catalytic activity caused by different catalyst loads was examined under typical conditions. As shown in Fig. 1a, in the presence of pure C3N4, the conversion ratio of HPA and the yield of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (HBD) were only 46.7% and 38.9%, respectively, indicating the mediocre catalytic activity of C3N4.

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nemploying an inorganic Co salt, such as CoCl2$6H2O, the conversion rate of HPA and the yield of HPB were 72.3% and 66.4%, respectively. This might be due to the agglomeration of the Co unit in the prepared catalyst. Co-L could be attached on the surface of C3N4 due to the p\u2013p interactions, which avoided the agglomeration effectively. Furthermore, other types of Co sources were also introduced to be compared with Co-Lattached C3N4. As shown in Fig. S2,\u2020 the conversion of HPA ranged from 30% to 72% in the presence of other Co sources. With Co-L loaded on C3N4, the conversion of HPA and the yield of HBD increased rapidly, reecting the excellent catalytic activity of Co-L/C3N4. The catalytic efficiency of Co-L/C3N4 was affected by the loading ratio of Co-L. As shown in Fig. 1a, HPA conversion increased from 87.8% to 94.0% when the Co-L loading amount increased from 5% to 20%. However, the highest yield of HBD reached was 77.6% in the presence of 10% Co-L/C3N4. This might be caused by the overoxidation of the obtained aldehyde in the presence of excess Co-L. Furthermore, the HPA conversion, HBD yield and selectivity corresponding to the repeated use of Co-L/C3N4-10 for 5 cycles are summarized in Fig. 1b. The photocatalytic activity of Co-L/C3N4-10 toward HBD formation hardly reduced aer recycling over ve runs, and the yield rate was maintained at 75%.

These results describe that Co doping facilitates secondary absorption in the visible light region, which would promote absorption in the wider range of visible light and the absorption efficiency of the system, resulting in higher photocatalytic activity.60,61 To further investigate the effect of Co doping on the optical bandgap energy of Co-L/C3N4, the Kubelka\u2013Munk method was used to calculate the bandgap of the prepared samples.62 As shown in Fig. 5b, the presence of the Co-L ligand slightly reduced the energy band of C3N4. The results show that the Co-L ligand presented a good optical response in the whole visible wavelength range (Eg of Co-L was about 1.85 eV, as shown in Fig. S6\u2020). At the same time, the optical response intensity of the Co-L/C3N4 hybrid material was signicantly stronger than that of ordinary C3N4. With an increase in Co-L ligand content, the uorescence intensity increased gradually, especially in the range of 550\u2013650 nm. This phenomenon showed that the introduction of Co-L effectively improved the light absorption ability of the C3N4 material.63\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 5245\u20135254 | 5249\nFig. 4 (a) N2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms of C3N4 and Co-L/C3N4; (b) the corresponding pore size distribution curves of C3N4 and Co-L/ C3N4.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The values of EFB were estimated to be 0.86 V and 0.97 (vs. NHE) for Co-L and C3N4, respectively. Compared with C3N4, a positive shi in the EFB of Co-L demonstrated a decrease in the bending of the band edge, thus facilitating electron transfer.64 The reason for the improvement in the photocatalytic activity of the Co-L/C3N4 nanocomposites was investigated by photochemical experiments. As shown in Fig. 6a, the photocurrent responses of C3N4 were much lower than that of Co-L combined C3N4 due to the rapid recombination of the photoexcited e and h+. However, the photocurrent intensity increased dramatically along with the introduction of Co-L, and the Co-L/C3N4-15 catalyst exhibited the highest photocurrent density, which is consistent with the steady-state PL results. The obvious changes in the current response of the Co-L/C3N4 samples under irradiation indicated the good photo-harvesting capability of the prepared samples. Moreover, aer several switching cycles, the photo-response was basically stable, further indicating the strong light\nFig. 5 (a) The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra of C3N4 and Co-L/\n5250 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 5245\u20135254\ncorrosion resistance of the nanocomposites.65,66 At the same time, it was observed that the transient current between the lamps decreased, which may be caused by the accumulation of charges before the lamp is turned on. The photoelectric response was closely related to the content of Co ions. The photocurrent of Co-L/C3N4-15 was 3 times that of C3N4, which indicated the excellent photo-response of the composite nanomaterial. For nano-photocatalysts, reducing the interfacial resistance can promote charge transfer and thus improve photocatalytic performance.67 The interfacial properties of semiconductors are usually studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).68 The interfacial resistance of the sample is expressed by the radius of the semicircle in the EIS.69 As shown in Fig. 6b, the radius of the C3N4 curve is larger than those of the Co-L loaded catalysts, and the radius of the semicircle decreases obviously aer the introduction of Co ions, indicating that the addition of Co-L clearly reduces the resistance at the C3N4 interface. The interface of the Co-L/C3N4-15 composite nanomaterials had minimum resistance, which is consistent with the results of the photocurrent.\nC3N4; (b) the bandgap energy of C3N4 and Co-L/C3N4.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

As shown in Fig. 7a, C3N4 showed a strong uorescence peak near 455 nm. Aer Co-L was loaded on C3N4, the uorescence peak intensity of Co-L/C3N4 decreased signicantly, indicating effectively suppressed recombination of the photogenerated charges. Furthermore, the photogenerated electron\u2013hole recombination is also the critical factor to improving the photocatalytic oxidation efficiency.

C3N4 afforded a shorter average uorescence lifetime (3.07 ps) compared with the Co-L/C3N4 (5.79 ps), which fully implied that the activated state in Co-L/ C3N4 was long-lived than that in C3N4. The longer lifetime of electrons could be attributed to the remarkable separation of the photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs.71\u201373"

            "text": "In order to investigate the mechanism of 4-hydroxyphenylglycolic acid oxidation, the probable reaction pathway was explored by employing in situ FTIR and UV absorption spectroscopy.\nThe IR spectra of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 4-hydroxyphenylglycolic acid in water were collected from a series of undersaturated solutions with known solute concentrations. To exhibit the reaction clearly, the differential absorption (DA) data was collected and processed, as shown in Fig. 8a. Peaks pointing down indicated bands disappearing, while those pointing up corresponded to new bands appearing due to the catalytic reaction. The increased intensity of the DA value at 1650 cm 1 was vested to the band of C]O stretching vibration, which represents the generation of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde by oxidation of benzyl alcohol in 4-hydroxyphenylglycolic acid.74 At the same time, the increased DA peaks at 1245 and 1170 cm 1 (as shown in Fig. 8b) belonged to the C\u2013C stretching vibration and the conjugation of aromatic ketones following the 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde ketonic acid generation.75 The peaks at 1520 cm 1 and 1480 cm 1 were attributed to the intermediates of the conversion of 4-hydroxyphenylglycolic acid to ketonic acid. The peak at 1020 cm 1 was attributed to the C\u2013C stretching vibration. The decline in the peaks was attributed to the probable fracture of C\u2013C caused by the decarboxylation of the intermediate ketonic acid.76 UV-visible spectroscopy was an important method to study the oxidation of 4-hydroxymandelic acid to 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. As shown in Fig. S8,\u2020 the decrease in the strong absorption peak at 249 nm could be attributed to the p\u2013p* transition of the benzene ring.

The changes in the UV-visible spectrum indicated the transformation of 4-hydroxymandelic acid to 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde clearly under irradiation.\nOn the basis of the above results, a plausible mechanism for the catalytical process has been proposed, as shown in Fig. 9. The Co-L loaded to C3N4 signicantly enhances the visible light absorption, which has been proven by the UV-Vis and PL valence band spectra analysis. Therefore, under visible light irradiation, electrons are excited to the conduction band from the valence band of C3N4, with the holes staying on the valence band simultaneously.77\u201379 The electrons in the conduction band of Co-L/C3N4 can be trapped by electrophilic O2 to produce superoxide radical anions (cO2\n).80,81 On the other hand, the transition of Co2+/Co3+ ensures the generation of cO2\n, which causes the substrate oxidation reaction. The high concentration of cO2\nis captured by p-hydroxymandelic acid and further experiences the hydroxylation process to give OH nally. The deprotonated p-hydroxymandelic acid forms the pivotal intermediate (a-keto carboxylate radical) to accomplish the oxidation process. Simultaneously, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde is generated following the decarboxylation of the pivotal intermediate. The continuously generated cO2 radicals greatly\n5252 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 5245\u20135254\npromote the conversion rate of p-hydroxymandelic acid in the photocatalytic process."

            "text": "In conclusion, a Co-L/C3N4 composite photocatalyst was designed and prepared for high-efficiency aromatic aldehyde generation under normal temperature and pressure, with oxygen as the oxidant. The Co-L-loaded C3N4 could accelerate the separation of the photogenerated carriers and signicantly improve photocatalytic activity. Under ultraviolet light irradiation, the conversion of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde was 93.1%, which is 2 times higher than that achieved with pure C3N4. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the synergistic effect of Co-L and C3N4, which promote the remarkable separation of the photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs and charge transfer. This work provides a useful strategy for aromatic aldehyde production in wastewater containing substituted mandelic acid derivatives, thus promoting the recycling of waste resources.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conicts to declare."
