    "abstractText": "A high-resolution background-oriented schlieren (BOS) technique, which utilizes a high-resolution camera and a microdot background pattern, is proposed and used to measure the pressure field of an underwater shock wave in a microtube. The propagation of the shock wave subsequently reaches a concave water\u2013air interface set in the microtube resulting in the ejection of a focused microjet. This high spatial-resolution BOS technique can measure the pressure field of a shock front with a width as narrow as the order of only 10 \u03bc m with a peak pressure as large as almost 3 MPa. This significant breakthrough has enabled the simultaneous measurement of the pressure impulse of the shock front and the velocity of the microjet tip. As a result, we have experimentally observed the linear relation between the velocity of the microjet tip and the pressure impulse of the shock front for the cases without secondary cavitation in the liquid bulk. Such relation was theoretically/ numerically predicted by Peters et al. (J Fluid Mech 719:587\u2013605, 2013). This study demonstrated the capability of the proposed high-resolution BOS technique as a microscale contactless pressure measurement tool for underwater shock waves and potentially other microand nanofluids. * Yoshiyuki Tagawa tagawayo@cc.tuat.ac.jp 1 Department of Mechanical Systems Engineering, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Koganei, Tokyo 184-8588, Japan 2 Department of Chemical Engineering, Biotechnology and Materials, FCFM, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile 3 Institute of Global Innovation Research, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Koganei, Tokyo 184-8588, Japan Experiments in Fluids (2022) 63: 142",

Typical examples include the generation of high-speed microjets for needle-free injection systems (Menezes et\u00a0al. 2009). As predicted theoretically/numerically, the microjet velocity is strongly influenced by the pressure field in microfluidic devices (Peters et\u00a0al. 2013; Tagawa et\u00a0al. 2012). However, the use of contact measurement devices, such as needle-type hydrophones, causes distortion to the minutescaled flow. To measure the pressure in microfluidic devices, we focused on the background-oriented schlieren (BOS) technique (Venkatakrishnan and Meier 2004), which is a contactless density measurement technique with a simple experimental setup (Hayasaka and Tagawa 2019). The BOS technique has been applied to measure the density field of a shock wave (Meier 2002; Yamamoto et\u00a0al. 2015). The first successful pressure field measurement using the BOS technique was performed by Hayasaka et\u00a0al. (2016). However, to measure the pressure field in microfluidic devices, the spatial resolution must be significantly high to accurately measure\nthe distortion of the displacement field. In this letter, we apply the noninvasive BOS technique with a spatial resolution as high as 0.68 \u03bcm/pixel. We then focus on the analysis between the pressure impulse and microjet velocity generated by the corresponding underwater shock waves. Note that the pressure impulse of the underwater shock wave is obtained by the integration of the pressure field in the shock front vicinity with respect to time."

In our experiments, the energy of a single pulse is varied from 0.36 to 0.97\u00a0mJ. The microdot background pattern (MEMS 8 \u00d7 8 \u03bc m dot size) is\nExperiments in Fluids (2022) 63: 142\n1 3\nPage 3 of 5 142\nattached to the wall of the capillary tube. High resolution images are captured using a CMOS camera (EOS Kiss X5, Canon, photographing resolution: 4000\u20136000 pixels) combined with a 105\u00a0mm focal length lens, two bellows, and several close-up rings, while being illuminated by an expanded laser beam of 640\u00a0nm (SI-LUX 640, Specialized Imaging Ltd.). The spatial resolution is set at 0.68 \u03bcm/pixel, which has enabled us to measure the pressure field of a shock front of a width as narrow as the order of 101 \u03bc m with a peak pressure as large as approximately 3\u00a0MPa. These are significantly narrower and larger, respectively, than the previous studies (Hayasaka et\u00a0al. 2016; Yamamoto et\u00a0al. 2015, i.e., 1\u00a0MPa.)\nThe microjet is captured with a high-speed camera at 50,000 fps (FASTCAM SA-X2, Photron) and illuminated using an expanded laser of 462 nm (CW Laser, IL-106B, HARDsoft). The shock wave laser, the high-resolution camera, the high-speed camera, and the light sources are triggered using a delay generator (Model 575, BNC). To avoid cross-illumination between the light sources, we install a high-pass filter on the high-resolution camera and a bandpass filter on the high-speed camera. An energy meter (EnergyMax-RS J0MB-HE, Coherent, USA, measurable range: 12\u00a0\u03bcJ-Hz) measuring the irradiation energy of the laser pulse using a half mirror (OptoSigma, transmittance: 50% up to 20\u00a0mJ) is assumed to be proportional to the energy absorbed by the irradiated water volume."

            "text": "As illustrated in Fig.\u00a02, the BOS technique quantifies a density-gradient field of a target by comparing the background\nimage distorted by the density gradient of the target and an undistorted background image. Venkatakrishnan and Meier (2004) showed that the displacement field of the distortion is proportional to the gradient of the refractive index. Therefore, it can be converted into the fluid density and then into the pressure distribution of the fluid. For this, the theory of the BOS technique was previously described in detail by Hayasaka et\u00a0al. (2016).\nThe measurement accuracy of the underwater shock wave pressure is highly dependent on the spatial resolution of the BOS technique. The change in the local displacement as a function of position can be written as \u223c \u27e8 v\u2215 y\u27e9 y , where y is the spatial resolution of the image. \u27e8 v\u2215 y\u27e9 y should be smaller than a certain threshold vth . By comparing BOS and hydrophone measurements (Yamamoto et\u00a0 al. 2015; Shimazaki et\u00a0 al. 2022), we estimate that vth \u2264 0.4 . Therefore, to increase displacement field gradients (larger pressures), a smaller spatial resolution, such as y \u223c vth\u2215\u27e8 v\u2215 y\u27e9 , is required.\nTypical high-resolution BOS images of the backgrounds without the shockwave (undistorted) and with the shock wave (distorted) obtained with our system are presented in Fig.\u00a03a and b, respectively. After the laser pulse was triggered ( t = 0 \u03bcs), the image of each shock wave was taken at an interval of t = 0.5 \u03bc s. The displacement field shown in Fig.\u00a03c is obtained by accurately registering (digital matching) the distorted and undistorted background images and computing the PIV cross-correlation (PIVlab, MATLAB2018), where the overall shape of the microshock wave is captured.\nIn this letter, we are interested in measuring the localized pressure at the shock front (indicated by the square region with black outline in Fig.\u00a03c). The displacement field of the localized region of interest is averaged along the x-axis for noise reduction and the profile is shown in Fig.\u00a03d. Along the z-axis, the profile is assumed to be constant to simplify the calculation. The density gradient is obtained by substituting the displacements v\nFig. 2 The micro-background and the image plane are aligned along the optical axis, i.e., the z-axis. With a distorted density field of depth W and a distance Z D , a displacement v is observed in the image plane (red dashed path).

(2015)). We then obtained the fluid density by integrating the density gradient with respect to the undistorted area (hydrostatic density 0 = 998\u00a0kg/m3 ), ( \u2212 0 ) \u221d ZDW \u222b \u27e8v\u27e9x dy , where shock waves do not propagate (right of the shock front shown in Fig.\u00a03c) (see Hayasaka et\u00a0al. 2016). From the density, the pressure value is calculated through the Tait equation, p+T\np 0 +T\n=\n(\n0\n) , where p\n0 is the hydrostatic pressure, and T\nand are constants with values of 314\u00a0MPa and 7, respectively. The spatial distribution of the pressure at the shockwave is shown in Fig.\u00a03e. It is transformed into the temporal distribution shown in Figures\u00a03(f) by assuming that the (unchanging) shock front is translating along the y-axis at the propagation speed of sound in water (1482\u00a0m/s at 20\u25e6 C). The pressure impulse of the shock wave is then\nobtained by integrating the temporal distribution, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a03f.\nThe numerical simulations performed by Peters et\u00a0al. (2013) have shown that the pressure impulse is proportional to the microjet velocity. Note that this simulation did not consider the effect of secondary cavitation in a liquid bulk, which might increase the jet velocity (Kiyama et\u00a0al. 2016; Hayasaka et\u00a0al. 2017)."

This is approximately 3 times larger than Yamamoto et\u00a0al. (2015).\nFigure\u00a04a presents an image sequence of the high-speed microjet generation. The air\u2013water interface is deformed and evolves into a focused (conical) shape. The jet velocity as a function of time is shown in Fig.\u00a04b where the jet reaches the maximum velocity of 13\u00a0m/s when the concave air-water interface converges at t = 60 \u03bc s. As previously reported by Tagawa et\u00a0al.

The comparison of BOS pressure impulse values for the cases without cavitation and the corresponding microjet tip velocity revealed a linear relation. This is consistent with the theoretical predictions by Peters et\u00a0al. (2013), which has validated the accuracy of our pressure impulse measurements.
