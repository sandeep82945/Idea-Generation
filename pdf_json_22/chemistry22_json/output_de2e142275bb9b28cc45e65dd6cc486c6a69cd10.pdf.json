            "text": "The Highland Railway is a major strategic deployment for Chinese development, a great project for long-term development, and with a hundred-year plan. In regional terms, it is necessary to further promote the economic development of the southwest region of China as well as the Tibetan region. But with the construction of the plateau railway requires a large number of metal materials (e.g. rails, steel bars, sound insulation panels, etc.), and the process of producing these metal materials will inevitably produce a large amount of heavy metal wastewater, which will cause serious environmental pollution if not treated in time. Chromium (Cr), one of the essential materials for alloy materials, generates a large amount of Cr wastewater during the manufacturing process of alloy materials and causes serious pollution to the environment (Altun et al. 2021; Chen et al. 2021). Chromium (Cr) is extensively used as an important raw material for production in industries such as metallurgy, electroplating, and alloy manufacturing (Chen et al. 2015). Cr in water mainly exists in the form of Cr(VI) and Cr(III), of which Cr(VI) is soluble, migratory, toxic, and hazardous to humans (Dong et al. 2017; Fei et al. 2021). At present, the treatment methods for Cr(VI)-containing wastewater include precipitation, photocatalysis, adsorption, and ion exchange (Hou et al. 2020; Jia et al. 2021; Jiang et al. 2021). The adsorption methods are of low operating cost, simple operation and high efficiency, and thus have received widespread attention (Pi et al. 2021).\nNanometer zero-valent iron (nZVI) hold abundant pore structure, strong reducibility, and high surface activity, and has a good removal effect on heavy metals, which has been widely used in environmental pollution (Qian et al. 2019; Qiu et al. 2020). However, the small particle size of nZVI, its high surface energy, and its magnetic properties, and hence its tendency to agglomerate, led to a significant reduction in specific surface area and reduction capacity, limiting its application in water treatment (Qiu et al. 2020; Zhao et al. 2020). To address this problem, researchers had attempted to use different materials as nZVI carriers to reduce particle agglomeration (Qiu et al. 2020; Tang et al. 2021). Biochar has a well-developed pore structure and a large number of functional groups on the surface and has good adsorption properties for heavy metals (Zhang et al. 2019; Zou et al. 2021). Biochar loaded with nZVI can effectively reduce the agglomeration effect of nZVI, and improve the reactivity of nZVI (Yi et al. 2020). Previous studies have shown that nZVI-loaded biochar can effectively improve the Cr removal from aqueous solutions and reduce the amount of chromium in aqueous solutions (Qiu et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2021). Zhou et al. (2020) showed that biochar loaded with nZVI was able to double the Cr(VI) adsorption capacity compared to raw biochar. In addition, a number of studies have shown that the specific surface area of virgin biochar is small. For this reason, ball milling was used to increase the specific surface area of the biochar to provide more sites for nZVI loading (Zou et al. 2021). Previous studies had shown that ball milling not only promoted interfacial effects between materials, but also improved the removal of contaminants from composites (Tang et al. 2021; Zou et al. 2021).\nIn this study, the nZVI-loaded sludge-derived biochar materials (nZVI@SDBC) were prepared and investigated their Cr(VI) adsorption performance from aqueous solutions. The purposes of the work were to: (1) investigate the effects of Cr(VI) removal under different environmental conditions; (2) reveal the mechanism of Cr(VI) removal by nZVI@SDBC; (3) evaluate the nZVI@SDBC for the Cr(VI) removal from actual electroplating wastewater; (4) analyze the cost per m3 of effluent removed by nZVI@SDBC. This work analyses the feasibility of nZVI@SDBC for the adsorption of Cr(VI) generated during the construction of highland railways from multiple perspectives (removal performance, mechanism, actual wastewater removal, and cost)."

Under an N2 inert environment, 1.125 g of NaBH4 was added and stirred for 30 min. After the reaction was complete, the precipitate was washed with distilled water and anhydrous ethanol two times in a turn.

This was also consistent with the results of a large number of studies (Yi et al. 2020). In Figure 2(b), the surface of the SDBC was characterized by the presence of a large number of massive structures, grooves, and surface unevenness. The presence of a large amount of particulate matter on the surface of nZVI@SDBC(2:1) (Figure 2(c)), indicates that nZVI was loaded on the SDBC surface. Moreover, nZVI@SDBC(2:1) showed a large amount of particulate matter on the surface after the Cr(VI) removal (Figure 2(d)), presumably to generate a Cr(III)-containing precipitate (Qiu et al. 2020; Yi et al. 2020). In the TEM image (Fig. S1), the overall dispersion of nZVI was relatively uniform, indicating that SDBC was able to effectively disperse the nZVI and solved the problem of easy agglomeration of nZVI (Qian et al. 2019).\n://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/86/9/2089/1133194/wst086092089.pdf\nDownloaded fr by guest on 25 January\nThe N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm was shown in Figure 3(a). As the relative pressure (P/P0) increased, the N2 adsorption capacity by the adsorbent gradually increased and a hysteresis loop was formed in the N2 adsorption-desorption curve. This result indicated that the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of the adsorbent can be classified as a type IV isotherm (Chen et al. 2021). Additionally, the specific surface areas of SDBC and nZVI@SDBC(2:1) were 93.19 m2/g and 186.38 m2/g, respectively. Literature had also reported that biochar loaded with nZVI can enhance its specific surface area (Tang et al. 2021). The pore size distribution concentrated between 2 and 50 nm (Figure 3(b)), which indicated that the adsorbent was a mesoporous material (Zhao et al. 2020). Furthermore, the pore sizes of SDBC and nZVI@SDBC(2:1) were found to be 11.75 nm and 14.92 nm, respectively. This phenomenon assumed that the nZVI particles were embedded in the pores of SDBC, resulting in a reduction in pore size (Qiu et al. 2020). The pHpzc (Figure 3(c)) of SDBC and nZVI@SDBC(2:1) was 2.73 and 3.64, respectively. When the solution pH was less than pHPZC, the adsorbent surface was protonated and positively charged. When the solution pH was higher than pHPZC, the adsorbent surface was deprotonated and negatively charged. This indicated that nZVI@SDBC(2:1) was able to attract negatively charged Cr(VI) at lower pH. The XPS overall spectrum (Figure 3(d)) shows a clear Fe 2p peak on nZVI@SDBC(2:1), indicating successful loading of Fe element on SDBC. The wavenumber at 3,420 cm 1 in SDBC was associated with O-H stretching vibrations (Chen et al. 2015). The characteristic peak at 1,620 cm 1 corresponded to the vibration of the C\u00bcO deformation conjugate (Qiu et al. 2020). The characteristic peak at a wavenumber of 1,430 cm 1 was considered to be the -COOH group (Yi et al. 2020). However, the vibrational peak at 1,070 cm 1 was thought to be due to C-O and Si-O groups (Qian et al. 2019; Qiu et al. 2020). After loading Fe0, the wavenumbers at 3,420 cm 1, 1,630 cm 1, and 1,410 cm 1 showed a significant change, indicating that the O-containing groups (R-OH and R-COOH) in nVZI@SDBC(2:1) may chelate with the Fe ion (Jia et al. 2021). Furthermore, the peak at 565 cm 1 corresponded to the Fe-O bond, which also indicated that nZVI was successfully loaded on SDBC (Qiu et al. 2020; Yi et al. 2020). Compared to nVZI@SDBC(2:1), there was no significant change in the FTIR spectrum after Cr(VI) removal. In contrast, the characteristic peaks of C\u00bcO and R-COOH were slightly shifted to 1,630 cm 1 and 1,410 cm 1, respectively.\nom http://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/86/9/2089/1133194/wst086092089.pdf 2024\nDownloaded from http by guest on 25 January 2024\nThe intensity of the Fe-O at 526 cm 1 increased, indicating that more Fe2O3 was produced after the reaction with Cr(VI) (Yi et al. 2020). The peak at 3,410 cm 1 was also enhanced, and this phenomenon may be caused by the formation of Fe2O3. This result suggested that the R-OH and R-COOH in nVZI@SDBC(2:1) underwent complexation with Cr(VI) (Jia et al. 2021; Tang et al. 2021).\nTo further analyze the Fe species, XRD (Figure 3(f)) was used to analyze the Fe species in SDBC and nZVI@SDBC(2:1). 2\u03b8\u00bc 21.28\u00b0, 26.82\u00b0, 35.16\u00b0, 36.94\u00b0, 42.76\u00b0, and 46.08\u00b0 in the XRD pattern of SDBC corresponded to SiO2, while 2\u03b8\u00bc 29.74\u00b0 and 39.74\u00b0 corresponded to CaCO3 (Chen et al. 2015; Qiu et al. 2020). After loading with nZVI, the peaks associated with SiO2 and CaCO3 in nZVI@SDBC(2:1) weakened or disappeared. Most notably, the presence of Fe\n0 was evidenced by the detection of a characteristic peak of 44.68\u00b0 in the XRD pattern of nZVI@SDBC (2:1) (Qian et al. 2019; Qiu et al. 2020; Yi et al. 2020). The diffraction peak at 2\u03b8 \u00bc 35.48\u00b0 was the Fe2O3 peak (Yi et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2021). After Cr(VI) removal, the Fe0 peak disappeared. This could be the involvement of Fe0 in the removal of Cr(VI). The diffraction peak at 2\u03b8 \u00bc 35.50\u00b0 was Cr2FeO4, presumably due to the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) by Fe\n0 and the formation of Cr(III)-Fe(II) precipitates (Qiu et al. 2020). After adsorption, the diffraction peak of Fe2O3 was enhanced, which may have allowed the reaction of Fe\n0 with Cr(VI) to form Fe2O3 (Yi et al. 2020)."

The solution pH can affect the surface electrical properties of the adsorbent and the morphology of Cr(VI) present in the solution. The results showed that the initial pH had a significant effect on the performance of nZVI@SDBC(2:1) for the Cr(VI) removal (Figure 4(a)). There was little difference in adsorption capacity between the initial pH of 2 and 3. As the solution pH increased from 3 to 10, the Cr(VI) adsorption capacity of nZVI@SDBC(2:1) decreased from 123.74 mg/g to 15.99 mg/g. It was found that nZVI@SDBC(2:1) was better at removing Cr(VI) under acidic conditions. Most notably, the pH of the final solution was higher than the initial pH in acidic conditions, while the final pH was lower than the initial pH in alkaline conditions.\n://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/86/9/2089/1133194/wst086092089.pdf\nDownloaded from http://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/86/9/2089/1133194/wst086092089.pdf by guest on 25 January 2024\nDownloaded from http by guest on 25 January 2024\nThe residual concentration of Crtotal, Cr(III), and Cr(VI) in the solution were measured separately (Figure 4(b)). The residual concentration of Crtotal and Cr(VI) increased with increasing solution initial pH. The residual concentration of Cr(III) first increased and then decreased, indicating that nZVI@SDBC(2:1) reduced some of the Cr(VI) to Cr(III) (Qian et al. 2019). The species distribution of Cr(VI) and Cr(III) in aqueous solution was modeled by Visual MINTEQ 3.1 software. At pH, 6.0, Cr(VI) was mainly present as the anions Cr2O7 2 (more than 90%) and CrO4 2 (less than 10%) (Fig. S2a). At solution pH, 5.0, Cr(III) was mainly present as Cr3\u00fe and Cr(OH)2\u00fe (Fig. S2b). At solution pH less than the zero potential point (pHPZC), the nZVI@SDBC(2:1) surface was protonated and positively charged (Qiu et al. 2020). As a result of the electrostatic effect, it will in turn enhance the Cr(VI) removal by nZVI@SDBC(2:1) and also promote the adsorption-reduction reaction of Cr(VI) to form Cr(III). Thus, electrostatic action contributed significantly to the removal of Cr(VI) under acidic conditions (Yi et al. 2020). However, the generated Cr(III) reacted with Fe(II) in solution by precipitation thereby forming a Cr2FeO4 precipitate (Qiu et al. 2020). When the solution pH was above the pHPZC, the adsorbent surface was deprotonated and negatively charged. The adsorbent and Cr(VI) repealed each other and reduced the opportunity for oxidation-reduction, thus leading to a decrease in adsorption capacity (Yi et al. 2020). Additionally, Cr(III) generated by Fe0/Fe(II) reduction can form insoluble Cr(OH)3 precipitates when the initial pH was above 5.0 (Equation (3)) (Yi et al. 2020). It had also been reported that under weakly acidic and basic conditions Cr(III) was able to form metal hydroxides (CrxFe1 x(OH)3/CrxFe1 XOOH) with Fe 3\u00fe (Equations (4) and (5)) (Dong et al. 2017; Qiu et al. 2020). During the reaction, H\u00fe was generated thus causing a drop in pH, which was also identical to the experimental data (Figure 3(a)) (Qiu et al. 2020; Tang et al. 2021).\nTo further understand, the adsorption-reduction of Cr(VI) by nZVI@SDBC(2:1). Fetotal, Fe 2\u00fe, and Fe3\u00fe were determined in the solution after reaction equilibration (Figure 4(c)). At lower pH, the leaching concentration of Fe was very high, which also provided more exposure of Cr(VI) to Fe0/Fe(II). Furthermore, the levels of Fetotal and Fe\n3\u00fe were essentially similar, while the levels of Fe2\u00fe were very small. One reason for this was that Fe(II) was oxidized by dissolved oxygen, but under acidic conditions, this process was very slow (Qiu et al. 2020). In addition, dissolved oxygen was limited in the closed vial, and Fe(II) was very stable. This also accelerated the reduction of Cr(VI) and the formation of Cr2FeO4 with Cr(III) in an aqueous solution, which was probably the reason why the amount of Fe(II) in the solution was very low (Yi et al. 2020). At the same time, the reduction process consumed a large amount of H\u00fe in the solution, increasing the solution pH (Qiu et al. 2020). However, under weakly acidic or alkaline conditions, the nZVI may be oxidized, thus reducing the amount of Fe species available for Cr(VI) reduction. Therefore, this led to a reduction in the adsorption capacity of Cr(VI).\nTo reduce the leaching of Fe ions and ensure the adsorption capacity of Cr(VI). Follow-up experiments choose pH 3.0 as the initial pH. The adsorption mechanism of Cr(VI) by nZVI@SDBC(2:1) consisted of electrostatic interaction and reduction.\nCr3\u00fe \u00fe 3OH !

The reason for this was that with increasing dosage of nZVI@SDBC(2:1), the number of active sites increased rapidly, resulting in a rapid increase in Cr(VI) removal efficiency (Yi et al. 2020). After the dosage was greater than 0.4 g/L, the removal efficiency remained more or less constant. However, as the dosage continues to increase and the Cr(VI) content of the solution was limited, the reduction of Cr(VI) removal efficiency slowed down and stabilized. Yet, the Cr(VI) adsorption capacity of nZVI@SDBC(2:1) decreased with increasing dosage, from 201.65 mg/g to 24.84 mg/g. The Cr(VI) adsorption capacity decreased as the dosage increased, due to the decrease in Cr(VI) adsorption per unit mass of nZVI@SDBC(2:1).

To further research the ability of the adsorbent to remove Cr(VI), the effect of coexisting cations on the Cr(VI) removal will be investigated (Figure 4(e)). The presence of Ca2\u00fe, Na\u00fe, and Mg2\u00fe had negligible effect on Cr(VI) removal by nZVI@SDBC(2:1). However, the concentration of Pb2\u00fe, Fe3\u00fe, and Ni2\u00fe in the solution was increased from 0 to 50 mg/L, and the removal efficiency of Cr(VI) by nZVI@SDBC(2:1) decreased to 53.78%, 83.89%, and 60.34%, respectively. It was presumed that coexists ions (Pb2\u00fe, Fe3\u00fe, and Ni2\u00fe) competed with Cr(VI) for adsorption sites (Wang et al. 2013). In addition, the competition strengthened as the concentration of coexisting ions increased, resulting in a significant inhibition of Cr(VI) removal.\nIn actual water bodies, carbonate ion (CO2 3 ) is the main substance that makes up the alkalinity of the water column and is\nfound at high levels in natural water bodies. Sulfate ion (SO2 4 ), silicate ion (SiO 2 3 ), nitrate ion (NO 3 ), phosphate ion (PO 3 4 ), and chloride ion (Cl ) are common anions in water bodies (Lv et al. 2013). Therefore, the effect of these anions on the Cr(VI) adsorption will be investigated (Figure 4(f)). The Cl , SiO2 3 , NO 3 , and CO 2 3 had essentially no effect on the Cr(VI) removal. There was a significant inhibition of Cr(VI) removal by nZVI@SDBC(2:1) by SO2 4 and PO 3 4 , with the removal efficiency decreasing to 70.64% and 61.34% respectively. SO2 4 and PO 3 4 had similar chemical structures to CrO 2 4 (one S, P, or Cr element combined with four O elements), and this had a strong inhibitory effect on the Cr(VI) removal (Zou et al. 2021)."

In the fast adsorption stage, the rapid increase in adsorption capacity was mainly due to a large number of adsorption sites available (Tang et al. 2021). As adsorption proceeded, the adsorption sites approached saturation and the adsorption rate slowed down until equilibrium was reached. Additionally, warming was able to enhance the Cr(VI) adsorption capacity on nZVI@SDBC. The explanation for this phenomenon was that higher reaction temperature increased the mobility of Cr(VI), and increased mobility of Cr(VI) facilitates a greater diffusion rate of those ions through the pores (Yi et al. 2020; Zhai et al. 2021).\nTo study the adsorption process and rate-controlling steps of the absorbent on Cr(VI), the pseudo-first-order kinetic model and pseudo-second-order kinetic model were chosen to analyze the experimental data.

The adsorption leveled off with increasing initial concentration, which may be due to the limited number of active sites on the nZVI@SDBC(2:1) surface (Tang et al. 2021).\nThe adsorption isotherm is extremely important in determining the mode of action of the adsorbent on the adsorbate. The Langmiur and modified Langmiur (Figure 6(b)), Freundich (Figure 6(c)) and Temkin (Figure 6(d)) adsorption isotherm models were chosen to analyse the experimental data. The correlation coefficients of the modified Langmuir model (R2\u00bc 0.999) were both higher than those of the Freundlich model (R2\u00bc 0.784) and the Temkin model (R2\u00bc 0.800). The results showed that the maximum adsorption capacity (178.96 mg/g) obtained from the modified Langmuir equation simulations and the actual adsorption capacity (179.78 mg/g) were comparable (Table 4). This illustrated that the modified Langmuir model was more suitable to interpret the Cr(VI) adsorption process by nZVI@SDBC(2:1) (Zhai et al. 2021). The results also demonstrated that the modified model was able to better analyse the Cr(VI) adsorption process by nZVI@SDBC(2:1). The Cr(VI) adsorption on the adsorbent surface was homogeneous monolayer adsorption and there was no interaction between the adsorption sites (Qian et al. 2019; Zhao et al. 2020; Tang et al. 2021). The separation factor RL\u00bc 0.003\u2013 0.009 demonstrated that the adsorption process was favorable (Dehghani et al. 2018). Compared with other adsorbents (Table S1), the qmax of nZVI@SDBC(2:1) for Cr(VI) removal in this study was better than most of the adsorbents, and\nTable 3 | Thermodynamic parameters of Cr(VI) removal by nZVI@SDBC(2:1)\nT/K \u0394G0 (J\u00b7mol 1) \u0394H0 (J\u00b7mol 1) \u0394S0 (J\u00b7mol 1\u00b7k 1)"

The overall spectra of nZVI@SDBC(1:1) before and after Cr(VI) removal (Figure 7(a)). The Cr 2p peak could be observed in the overall XPS spectrum after reaction, which indicated that Cr(VI) could be adsorbed by nZVI@SDBC(2:1).\nIn Figure 7(b), the peaks at 576.77 eV and 586.55 eV were Cr(III) peaks, and the peaks at 578.26 eV and 588.15 eV were Cr(VI) peaks (Qiu et al. 2020). The content of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) was 52.01% and 47.99%, respectively. This result further suggested that Cr(VI) was reduced by nZVI@SDBC(2:1) to Cr(III) (Yi et al. 2020). The main peaks of the pre-reaction O 1s were Fe-O (529.90 eV), C-O (531.07 eV), and C\u00bcO (532.15 eV) (Figure 7(c)) (Zhou et al. 2021). The increase in the peak area of Fe-O and decrease in the peak area of C\u00bcO after adsorption suggested that biochar can act as an electron transfer medium and participate in the reaction by gaining and losing electrons through certain functional groups on the surface (Qiu et al. 2020; Tang et al. 2021; Zou et al. 2021). Notably, the binding energies of C-O (531.27 eV) and C\u00bcO (532.23 eV) were increased after the reaction. This result may be attributed to the complexation of Cr(VI) with -OH or -COOH in\nom http://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/86/9/2089/1133194/wst086092089.pdf 2024\nDownloaded from http://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/86/9/2089/1133194/wst086092089.pdf by guest on 25 January 2024\nDownloaded fr by guest on 25 January\nnZVI@SDBC(2:1) (Pi et al. 2021). The weak peak in the Fe 2p spectrum of nZVI@SDBC(2:1) before adsorption (Figure 7(d)) attributable to Fe0 (706.92 eV) indicated the successful synthesis of nZVI (Qiu et al. 2020; Yi et al. 2020). Binding energies of 723.11 eV and 710.76 eV correspond to Fe(II) (Zhou et al. 2020; Zou et al. 2021). Binding energies of 725.26 eV and 712.78 eV correspond to Fe(III) (Tang et al. 2021). The disappearance of the Fe0 peak after adsorption, the decrease in the relative amount of Fe(II), and the increase in the relative amount of Fe(III) suggested that nZVI and Fe(II) were involved in the removal of Cr(VI) (Qiu et al. 2020; Yi et al. 2020). The XPS analysis illustrated that the -OH and -COOH in nZVI@SDBC(2:1) were related to the Cr(VI) adsorption, along with the reduction of Cr(VI) by nZVI (Jia et al. 2021; Pi et al. 2021; Zou et al. 2021).\nFrom the above results, we can deduce the Cr(VI) removal mechanism on nZVI@SDBC(2:1).\n(1) Part of the Cr(VI) (Cr2O 2 7 /HCrO 4 ) was removed directly by adsorption on nZVI@SDBC(2:1) through electrostatic inter-\naction and complexation of O-containing functional groups (Qiu et al. 2020; Zou et al. 2021). (2) Part of nZVI was oxidised to Fe2\u00fe (Equation (6)), and then Fe0/Fe2\u00fe reduced Cr(VI) to Cr(III)(Cr3\u00fe/Cr(OH)2\u00fe)\n(Equations (7)\u2013(10)) (Qiu et al. 2020; Yi et al. 2020; Zou et al. 2021). Finally, Cr(III) (Cr3\u00fe/Cr(OH)2\u00fe) combined with Fe2\u00fe to become Cr2FeO4 precipitate (Equations (11) and (12)) (Tang et al. 2021; Zou et al. 2021).

The Cr(VI) maximum adsorption on nZVI-SDBC(2:1) was 178.05 mg/g at pH 3.0, dosage 0.4 g/L and temperature 25 \u00b0C. The Cr(VI) adsorption on nZVI-SDBC(2:1) conform to the modified Langmuir isotherm model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, indicating that the adsorption process was homogeneous chemisorption. The Cr(VI) removal mechanism by nZVI@SDBC(2:1) was a complexation of O-containing groups, the formation of Cr(III)-Fe(II) precipitation, electrostatic interaction, and reduction. The Cr(VI) removal by nZVI@SDBC(2:1) was maintained at over 90% after five replicate experiments. nZVI@SDBC is capable of removing most of the Cr(VI) from real electroplating wastewater. The cost of using nZVI@SDBC(2:1) to remove 1 m3 of actual wastewater is approximately 325.7162 USD/m3. The results show that the nZVI@SDBC material has a good effect on the removal of Cr(VI)-containing wastewater generated during the preparation of metal materials in the construction of highland railways, as well as solves the problem of potential pollution generated during the construction of highland railways.\n://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/86/9/2089/1133194/wst086092089.pdf\nDownloaded fr by guest on 25 January\nFUNDING\nThis work was supported by National Key R&D Program (2018YFC1505404) and Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Department Science and Technology Plan Project (No.2021YJ0033).\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nAll relevant data are included in the paper or its Supplementary Information.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe authors declare there is no conflict."
