"Despite the above limitations, this study adds to the empirical evidence on the adverse effect of tobacco use on household welfare. The crowding out effect of tobacco use negatively impacts the economy as a whole, implying reduced investment in human capital development. The estimated household budgetary effects indicate that strengthening and accelerating tobacco control policies is necessary to reduce the consumption and spending on tobacco since it would enhance household-level and population-level well-being, especially of the most financially vulnerable groups of the society. Moreover, the estimated positive effect of tobacco spending on budget shares on bars and restaurants might indicate the issue of the smoke-free policy not being effectively implemented."
