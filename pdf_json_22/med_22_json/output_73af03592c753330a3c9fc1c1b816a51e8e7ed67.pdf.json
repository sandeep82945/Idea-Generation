However, underlying mechanisms of SARSCoV-2-induced multi-organ failure and subsequent death are still largely unknown. Cytokine storm, increased levels of inflammatory mediators, endothelial dysfunction, coagulation abnormalities, and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the organs contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. One potential consequence of immune/inflammatory events is the acute progression of generalized edema, which may lead to death. We, therefore, examined the involvement of water channels in the development of edema in multiple organs and their contribution to organ dysfunction in a Murine Hepatitis Virus-1 (MHV-1) mouse model of COVID19. Using this model, we recently reported multi-organ pathological abnormalities and animal death similar to that reported in humans with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We now identified an alteration in protein levels of AQPs 1, 4, 5, and 8 and associated oxidative stress, along with various degrees of tissue edema inmultiple organs, which correlatewell with animal survival postMHV-1 infection. Furthermore, our newly createddrug (a 15 amino acid synthetic peptide, known as SPIKENET) that was designed to prevent the binding of spike glycoproteins with their receptor(s), angiotensin- converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) (SARS-CoV-2 and MHV-1, respectively), ameliorated animal death and reversed altered levels of AQPsandoxidative stress post-MHV-1 infection.Collectively, our findings suggest the possible involvement of altered aquaporins and the subsequent edema, likely mediated by the virus-induced inflammatory and oxidative stress response, in the pathogenesis of COVID- 19 and the potential of SPIKENET as a therapeutic option.\nKeywords: animal death, aquaporins, COVID-19, multiorgan failure, oxidative stress, tissue edema, drug treatment\nEdited by: Saibal Das,\nICMR\u2014Centre for Mental Health and Ageing, India\nReviewed by: Ran You,\nNanjing Children\u2019s Hospital, China Jayanta Dey, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., India\n*Correspondence: Michael J.

            "text": "COVID-19 is caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus that causes respiratory illness and can ultimately result in organ damage and multi-organ failure (Mokhtari et al., 2020 and references therein). The multi-organ damage is thought to be caused by cytokine storm, septic shock, thrombosis, and oxidative/nitrative stress (Xu et al., 2020). There have been more than 470 million cases in the last 27 months and over 6 million deaths across almost 200 countries. Further, the number of cases and deaths continue to increase despite vaccination, and underlying mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced multi-organ failure and subsequent death remain largely unknown.\nThe multi-organ dysfunction induced by SARS-CoV-2 includes acute lung, liver and progressive kidney failure, neurological complications, cardiovascular disease, and a multitude of hematologic abnormalities (Gu et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2020; El Zowalaty et al., 2020; Mokhtari et al., 2020; Robba et al., 2020; Shanmugaraj et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Henderson et al., 2021; Lopes-Pacheco et a., 2021; Matsuishi et al., 2021; Thakur et al., 2021; Tyagi and Singh, 2021; Zhao et al., 2022). The acute lung failure is characterized by the presence of focal, interstitial, diffuse proteinaceous and alveolar edema (Ackermann et al., 2020; Menter et al., 2020). The liver failure is likely due to a direct SARS-CoV-2 cytopathy based on the ultrastructural features of conspicuous mitochondria swelling in the infected hepatocytes (Wang et al., 2020). The progressive kidney injury is due to edema with an associated inflammatory infiltrate of the renal interstitium (Larsen et al., 2020), swelling of cells and edema in the interstitial space of distal tubules and collecting ducts. With regards to neurological complications, autopsies of brain samples from patients who died of COVID19 revealed the presence of edema (Reichard et al., 2020). Cytotoxic brain edema was also identified in a newborn with COVID-19 (Fragoso et al., 2021). Some reported signs of cardiovascular damage from SARS-CoV-2 infection showed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, interstitial hyperemia, edema, left ventricular dilatation and inflammation (Puntmann et al., 2020). These findings suggest that the development of edema is multisystemic in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nCytokine storm has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 (Jose and Manuel, 2020; Zaim et al., 2020). One potential consequence of immune and inflammatory events is the acute progression of generalized edema, which may lead to death (Wiggli et al., 2013; Rump and Adamzik, 2018).\nAquaporins (AQPs) are integral membrane proteins that function to aid the diffusion of water and small solutes across the cell membrane, thereby regulating extracellular-intracellular osmolar balance (Verkman and Mitra, 2000; Agre, 2006). Several studies have shown that AQPs can be regulated by microbial/ parasitic infections, inflammation-associated responses, and vascular and cell water homeostasis, which implicate their involvement in the disease progression (Azad et al., 2021 and references therein). While thrombosis and inflammation are major factors in SARS-CoV- 2 infection (Mitchell, 2020), studies addressing their interaction with AQPs are absent.\nThus far, the only studies that even mention AQPs in relation to respiratory viruses do not investigate the mechanisms: 1) a 59- year-old woman with aquaporin-4-positive neuromyelitis Optica who developed mild respiratory syndrome (Creed et al., 2020), and 2) reduced AQP-1 level was observed in lung endothelial cells in golden Syrian hamsters (Allnoch et al., 2021). However, little to nothing is currently known regarding the role of AQPs in multiorgan dysfunction in SARS- CoV-2 infection. We, therefore, investigated whether AQPs play a role in multi-organ dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nWe recently established a Murine Hepatitis Virus-1 (MHV-1) mice model of COVID-19 (Paidas et al., 2021). In this model, infection of A/J mice with MHV-1 produces symptoms similar to those seen clinically in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and leads to high mortality (Khanolkar et al., 2009; Leibowitz et al., 2010; Agostini et al., 2018; Caldera-Crespo et al., 2021; De Albuquerque., 2006; Paidas et al., 2021; Tian et al., 2021). Two days post-MHV-1 inoculation the mice present with severe pulmonary disease and 7 days post-infection the mortality reaches 60% (Khanolkar et al., 2009; Leibowitz et al., 2010; Agostini et al., 2018; Caldera-Crespo et al., 2021; De Albuquerque., 2006; Paidas et al., 2021; Tian et al., 2021). On day 2, pulmonary edema, as evidenced by fluid accumulation in the alveolar spaces, and patchy interstitial alveolar thickening was observed. On days 2 and 6 post-MHV-1 infection, morphometric analysis showed infiltration of the lung tissue by macrophages and neutrophils. Increased infiltrates of T cells were also noted by day 6 post-infection. At death, the lungs showed severe interstitial pneumonitis with the presence of consolidation, hyaline membranes, fibrin deposition, and dense lymphocyte and macrophage infiltrate. Liver histology was normal up to day 6, but on day 7, just prior to death, there was severe hepatic congestion and lung and heart failure, as described in humans (Agostini et al., 2018; Caldera-Crespo et al., 2021; De Albuquerque et al., 2006; Paidas et al., 2021; Tian et al., 2021). These findings show that A/J mice develop both a SARS-like pulmonary disease and subsequent multi-organ failure when inoculated with MHV-1 intranasally, despite these two coronaviruses using different receptors, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) (SARS-CoV-2 and MHV-1, respectively). It should be highlighted that the activation of CEACAM1 was shown to stimulate clinical aspects similar to those of SARS-CoV-2 (Khanolkar et al., 2009; Leibowitz et al., 2010; Agostini et al., 2018; Caldera-Crespo et al., 2021; De Albuquerque et al., 2006; Paidas et al., 2021; Tian et al., 2021).\nCoronaviruses have advanced various mechanisms to identify diverse receptors for their cross- species transmission and expansion. These viruses use a variety of cellular receptors and co- receptors that allow them to infect a wide range of avian and mammalian species (Trbojevi\u0107- Akma\u010di\u0107 et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). The spike protein mainly mediates viral entry into host cells (Huang et al., 2020; Trbojevi\u0107-Akma\u010di\u0107 et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021), although several other molecules have been suggested (e.g., C-type lectins, DC-SIGN, L-SIGN) (Rahimi, 2020; Th\u00e9paut et al., 2021; Jackson et al., 2022). During maturation, the spike protein is cleaved into receptor binding\nFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 8647982\nand membrane fusion subunits (S1 and S2 subunits, respectively) (Duan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Jackson et al., 2022). The S1 subunit contains the amino-terminal (N- terminal) domain (NTD) and C domain, and the C domain binds to the Aminopeptidase-N and ACE2, while the NTD binds to CEACAM1 in MHV (Zhang et al., 2021). However, thus far it is not known whether the NTD plays a functional role in SARSCoV-2 entry mechanisms.\nMHV is more extensively studied than any other coronaviruses. The primary physiological function of its receptor, CEACAM1, is to mediate cell adhesion and signaling. CEACAM1 is chiefly expressed in macrophages, epithelial and endothelial cells. While mammalian CEACAM are conserved, only murine CEACAM1a serves as an efficient MHV receptor (see references Jackson et al., 2022; Peng et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2020 for structural and functional aspects and similarities and differences between ACE2 and CEACAM1). While the molecular determinants for the viral and host specificities of SARS-CoV have been elucidated in the past decade, the interaction between coronaviruses and CEACAM1 remains elusive.\nDespite available vaccination against COVID-19, the number of cases and deaths continue to increase. Additionally, the FDA has fully approved just one drug, Remdesivir, to counteract SARS-CoV-2 infection, and only for certain populations (i.e., hospitalized adult and pediatric patients aged \u226512 years and weighing \u226540 kg), while Paxlovid (Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir tablets- oral use), Dexamethasone, Molnupiravir (MK-4482/ EIDD-281), Bamlanivimab, Etesevimab, Casirivimab and Imdevimab were authorized for emergency use by FDA. Based on the molecular structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-1 (S1) and its interaction with the ACE2 receptor, we designed a peptide (a 15 amino acid synthetic peptide, also known as SPIKENET) that specifically binds to S1, thereby preventing SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cell. We found that SPIKENET reversed the disease and reduced death in an MHV-1 mice model of COVID-19. SPIKENET also reduced oxidative stress, and altered AQPs and tissue edema in multiple organs, strongly suggesting that infection-induced changes in tissue oxidative stress and the subsequent increase in tissue edema may be crucial factors in the progression of COVID-19."

We also examined whether SPIKENET has a binding affinity with the human ACE2 receptor. A molecular docking study between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and SPIKENET was performed to understand the nonbonded interactions, and peptide conformation over the human ACE2 binding site of the RBD and to calculate the binding affinity of the\npeptide. The docking study created 10 different conformations of SPIKENET after the docking simulation. From these conformations, the highest binding affinity model (\u2212156.2 kcal/ mol) was chosen for further binding analysis. To confirm the peptide binding affinity of S1 and ACE2 with SPIKENET, we also measured the extent of SPIKENET binding with S1 and ACE2 by spectroscopy. Briefly, the absorbance with relevant wavelength for S1 or ACE2 and SPIKENET was collected independently as well as when S1 or ACE2 and SPIKENET were added together.\nSince the MHV-1 host receptor is CEACAM1 (CCM), we first examined whether SPIKENET has a binding affinity with the CEACAM-1 RBD of the MHV-1 N-terminal domain (NTD) (MHV-1 S1) as well as with the CCM. Accordingly, we performed molecular docking of SPIKENET with SARS-CoV-2 S1, as well as molecular dynamic studies to confirm the binding of SPIKENET with MHV-1 NTD, and with CCM.\nThe initial structures of the MHV1-NTD and CCM human receptor were obtained from the Protein Data Bank database from the structure of 6vsj, and the NTD was truncated at residues 16\u2013283 fromMHV1-S1 for dynamic study. The ligand peptide of SPIKENET has 15 residues with the sequence of MVRIKPASANKPSDD and its 2D structure was built using the Avogadro (v. 1.2.0) molecular modeling program, and geometrical optimization was done using the Steepest Descent algorithm with the universal force field to get an energyoptimized 3D structure. To investigate the binding efficacy of SPIKENET with the NTD of MHV1-S1 and receptor CCM, the truncated NTD and CCM were docked with SPIKENET using ClusPro server at the NTD and CCM binding site. SPIKENET binding with NTD and CCM was subjected to Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to understand the binding affinity of SPIKENET (SPK) with NTD and CCM. MD simulation was performed with the default setting of the GROMACS 5.4.1 package and simulation was done by applying GROMOS96 54a7 force field for all protein atoms. After the minimization of complex structure, position restrained MD simulation was done upon slow heating to 300 K in NVT [conserved amount of substance (N), volume (V) and temperature (T) in the canonical ensemble] and NPT [conserved amount of substance (N), pressure (P) and temperature (T) in the isothermal\u2013isobaric ensemble] with a constant particles number, constant temperature, constant volume, and constant pressure, respectively, at 1 atm pressure throughout 500 ps. The final production MD calculation was then carried out for a total of 50ns MD simulation for our target complexes of NTD + SPK and CCM + SPK with a time step of 1 fs at the constant pressure (1 atm) and temperature (300 K). The MD trajectories were analyzed from time to time using the visual molecular dynamic (VMD) program.\nMHV-1 Inoculation and the Effect of"

Briefly, all the trajectories of both complexes, N terminal domain-SPIKENET (NTD-SPK) and CEACAM1-SPIKENET (CCM-SPK), were analyzed to understand the binding affinity of SPK with NTD/ CCM and their conformational changes during the simulation. Hence, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) for protein backbone atoms using least-squares fitting, and the root mean square fluctuation for every residue were calculated for both complexes and the native proteins using their final coordinates obtained from MD simulation. The RMSD of both complexes, NTD-SPK and CCM-SPK, with their respective native proteins are shown in Figures 1F,G. Comparing the RMSD of both NTD/NTD + SPK after 50 ns dynamic simulation, the structures showed complete equilibration in the system and the SPK peptide is well stabilized with high affinity at the CCM binding location of the NTD (Figure 1F). However, the RMSD analysis of CCM and CCM + SPK structures after the 50 ns dynamic simulation exhibit more\nflexibility at the NTD binding site of CCM than native CCM (Figure 1G), suggesting SPK detachment/displacement over the CCM.

Further, SPIKENET, our newly created drug (a 15 amino acid synthetic peptide) that was\nFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 86479812\ndesigned to prevent binding of spike proteins with their receptor(s), ameliorated animal death, pathological changes, the altered protein levels of AQPs, and the formation of edema post-MHV-1. Additionally, SPIKENET also ameliorated animal death in a humanized animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection (unpublished observation). Collectively, these findings suggest the possible involvement of aquaporins and the subsequent development of edema in various organs in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. AQP activity is highly regulated by gating or by trafficking in the plasma membrane. Phosphorylation of serine residues has been shown to modulate AQP gating (Johansson et al., 1998; Pires-Neto et al., 2016). AQPs (AQP0-AQP12) are divided into three sub-classes based on the selectiveness of the pores: orthodox aquaporins (AQPs 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8), aquaglyceroporins (AQPs 3, 7, 9, and 10) and unorthodox aquaporins (AQPs 11 and 12) (Agre, 2006). AQPs serve different functional purposes and are implicated in a wide variety of diseases including cancer, renal dysfunction, neurological disorders, metabolic syndrome, and cardiac diseases (Azad et al., 2021).\nLung edema can appear suddenly or may develop over a period depending on the cause (e.g., defective heart conditions, pneumonia, or exposure to toxins, viral infection, blood poisoning and sepsis, or due to certain drugs) (Towne et al., 2000; Wittekindt and Dietl, 2019), resulting in chest pain, difficulty in breathing, etc. Studies on lung diseases have shown that AQPs are involved in diseases where there is\ndisturbance of airway surface liquid volume homeostasis, such as in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acute lung injury (Towne et al., 2000; Wittekindt and Dietl, 2019). The precise mechanism involved in the development of lung edema induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown.\nAs noted above, one mechanism which is actively involved in transporting water across plasma membranes is the expression of AQPs. AQPs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are predominantly expressed in the lung, particularly in the plasma membranes of endothelial, epithelial, basal, glandular, and acinar cells of the nasal epithelium, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles (Towne et al., 2000; Wittekindt and Dietl, 2019 and references therein).\nAn increase in AQP1 and 5 has been observed in patients with acute lung injury and diffuse alveolar damage (Pires-Neto et al., 2016). While AQP1 levels are increased generally in most organs, its level decreased in the lung during other infections (Towne et al., 2000). Indeed, a recent study showed vascular inflammation and loss of AQP1 expression in endothelial cells, as well as increased fluid extravasation in SARS-CoV-2-infected golden Syrian Hamsters (Allnoch et al., 2021). Similarly, we identified decreased levels of AQP1 in MHV-1 inoculated mice. Further, treatment of MHV-1 infected mice with our newly created peptide, SPIKENET, reversed such a reduction, as well as diminished the level of elevated edema and animal death.\nWhile the reason for the decline in levels of AQP-1 in our study, or the study performed in Syrian hamsters by Allnoch\nFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 86479813\net al. (2021) is unclear, Allnoch et al. speculated that inflammation may be involved since there is an infiltration of macrophages in the alveolus that is known to affect intercellular junctions and might be causing the observed loss of AQP1. In general, a decrease in AQP-1 positively correlated with an increase in macrophage-derived mediators such as the generation of free radicals and cytokines, along with increased edema (Allnoch et al., 2021 and references therein). Additionally, loss of AQP1 level was also observed during hypoxic conditions (Towne et al., 2000; Wittekindt and Dietl, 2019), suggesting that hypoxia may also be a major event in the lung post-infection.\nWhile other studies have reported decreased levels of AQP5 and associated elevation in lung edema in other viral infections (Towne et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2018), we found elevated levels of AQPs 4, 5, and 8 in MHV-1 inoculated mice. Further, treatment with SPIKENET inhibited the increase of these AQP levels, in addition to reducing lung edema and animal death. The reason for such a contradiction between these studies and ours is unclear, but it is possible that the signaling system that is activated by SARS-CoV-2 may be different than that in other viruses studied. Collectively, these findings suggest the potential involvement of AQPs 1, 4, 5, and 8 in the development of lung edema and the subsequent progression of infection.\nFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 86479814\nAccordingly, our identification of altered levels of these AQPs and its contribution to the development of lung edema is crucial to better understanding the pathophysiology of SARS-Cov-2 infection.\nEdema is one of the serious clinical features of nephritic and nephrotic syndrome and may cause localized puffiness to massive, generalized edema (Palmer and Alpern, 1997; Kurtzman, 2001). Abnormal accumulation of interstitial fluid in these conditions results from anomalous renal sodium retention and increased capillary wall permeability. Additionally, altered AQP expression has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of these syndromes (Wang et al., 2015; Valtue\u00f1a et al., 2020). There are 7 AQPs in the kidney (AQP1, AQP2, AQP3, AQP4, AQP6, AQP7 and AQP11). We indeed identified increased levels of AQPs 1, 4, 5, and 8 in\nMHV-1 infected mice in various organs, although evidence for severe edema in the kidney in other infectious diseases is scant. Since nephritic and nephrotic syndromes are well known to induce massive, generalized edema (Kwon et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2015; Valtue\u00f1a et al., 2020), it is possible that the increased level of AQPs 1, 4, 5 and 8 in MHV-1 infected mice kidneys may cause whole-body edema or it may contribute to the potentiation of infection-induced edema in various organs in COVID-19.\nEdema in the liver and heart has also been implicated in disease progression in various conditions including in infection-induced injury to these organs and altered AQPs have been strongly implicated in their pathogenesis (Marinelli and LaRusso, 1997; Schrier et al., 2001; Frustaci et al., 2021). Our study also demonstrates significant edema in these organs, and treatment of these mice with SPIKENET reduced such edema. Thus, it is\nFIGURE 12 | Effect of SPIKENET (SPK) on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress (protein carbonyl formation) (12 h) (A), and LPS-induced LDH release (36 h) (B) in primary cultures of rat brain microglia, as well as H2O2-induced increase in cell volume (24 h) in primary cultures of rat brain astrocytes (C).

Studies have also shown the potential involvement of AQPs 1, 5, and 9 in the development of brain edema in a variety of neurological conditions (Badaut et al., 2002; Papadopoulos et al., 2002). Increased AQPs, the associated edema, and the subsequent increased intracranial pressure and herniation has been strongly implicated in the development of coma and subsequent death (Agre, et al., 1997; Badaut et al., 2002). We indeed identified elevated levels of AQPs 1, 4, 5, and 8 in the brains of MHV-1 inoculated mice, along with an increase in edema, and treatment of thesemice with SPIKENET exhibited a reduction in these AQPs, as well as in animal death. These findings strongly suggest the potential involvement of infection-indued brain AQPs and their involvement in edema formation and subsequent animal death in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The role of AQPs in the mechanisms of solute transport has been well established over a decade. Based on our current findings, we predict that generalized edema development may be a major event in SARS-CoV-2 infection, since alteration of water transport-related AQPs was specifically identified in this study (i.e., AQPs 1, 4, 5, 8). However, we cannot rule out the possibility of altered AQPs that regulate other solutes that may contribute to organ dysfunction. For example, AQP1 has also been proposed to transport CO2, glycerol, and cations under some conditions (Agre, et al., 1997; Yang .et al., 2000), but these results have been questioned (Agre, et al., 1997; Yang .et al., 2000). These aspects, in addition to its interaction with other ion channels/transporters/exchangers, need to be explored.\nWhile we found changes in various AQPs in a particular organ, it is unclear whether all of these AQPs are involved in water transport, or they also transport other solutes/ions which may contribute to the multiorgan dysfunction observed in the current study. Further, it is not clear whether any interaction occurs in these AQPs that can regulate solute/ion movement. These aspects will be explored in future studies.\nOverall our study demonstrates that AQPs 1, 4, 5, and 8 are increased in all organs examined except that AQP1 levels in the lung are reduced. Our findings on AQP1 support earlier findings showing that AQP1 levels decreased in lung endothelial cells in a humanized animal model of SARS-CoV-2 (Allnoch et al., 2021), and strongly suggest the usefulness of our model to study COVID-19. While there were limited to no expression or protein levels of one or more of the AQPs identified in various organs in normal mice, there was a significant increase in the levels of these AQPs in MHV-1 infected mice, suggesting\nthat these AQPs may be conserved and expressed under favorable conditions. While it is not clear whether the altered levels of AQPs play a role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, our findings which demonstrate that SPIKENET prevented both animal death, as well as reversed the changes in AQP levels and edema, strongly suggest the potential role of AQPs in the mechanisms of animal death in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, targetting AQPs may be a useful approach to treat COVID-19 and diminish some of the multiorgan consequences."
