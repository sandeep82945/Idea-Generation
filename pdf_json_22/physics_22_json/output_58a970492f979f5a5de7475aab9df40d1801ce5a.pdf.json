    "abstractText": "In quantum private information retrieval (QPIR), a user retrieves a classical file from multiple servers by downloading quantum systems without revealing the identity of the file. The QPIR capacity is the maximal achievable ratio of the retrieved file size to the total download size. In this paper, the capacity of QPIR from MDS-coded and colluding servers is studied for the first time. Two general classes of QPIR, called stabilizer QPIR and dimension-squared QPIR induced from classical strongly linear PIR are defined, and the related QPIR capacities are derived. For the non-colluding case, the general QPIR capacity is derived when the number of files goes to infinity. A general statement on the converse bound for QPIR with coded and colluding servers is derived showing that the capacities of stabilizer QPIR and dimension-squared QPIR induced from any class of PIR are upper bounded by twice the classical capacity of the respective PIR class. The proposed capacity-achieving scheme combines the star-product scheme by Freij-Hollanti et al. and the stabilizer QPIR scheme by Song et al. by employing (weakly) self-dual Reed\u2013Solomon codes.

INTRODUCTION\nW ITH the amount of data stored in distributed storagesystems steadily increasing, the demand for user privacy has surged in recent years. One notion that has received considerable attention is private information retrieval (PIR), where the user\u2019s goal is to access a file of a (distributed) storage system without revealing the identity (index) of this desired file. In their seminal work Chor et al. [2] introduced the concept of PIR from multiple non-colluding servers, each storing a copy of every file. More recently, the capacity, i.e., the highest achievable rate, for this setting [3] was derived, which led to similar derivations in more general settings admitting for colluding servers [4], coded storage [5], and symmetric privacy [6], [7]. While the capacity of PIR from coded storage with colluding servers remains an open problem, some progress was made in [8]\u2013[10]. Among other things, [9], [10] introduce the practical notion of strongly linear PIR. Informally, this class is given by PIR schemes where both the computation of the server responses and the decoding of the desired file from these responses is achieved by applying linear functions. The capacity of this class of schemes coincides with a conjecture on the asymptotic (in the number of files) capacity for this setting [11] and is known to be achievable by schemes with requiring only small subpacketization, such as the star-product scheme of [12].\nQuantum PIR (QPIR) considers accomplishing the PIR task with quantum communication between the user and the servers [13]\u2013[20]. Following the study on the classical PIR capacity [4], the papers [21]\u2013[24] considered the capacity of QPIR and quantum symmetric PIR (QSPIR), where the user obtains no other information than the desired file in addition to the requirements of PIR. The QPIR schemes in [21]\u2013[24] are conducted by the following procedure: a user uploads classical queries; multiple servers sharing entanglement apply quantum operations on their quantum systems depending on the queries and the files and respond quantum systems to the user; the user finally retrieves the desired file by quantum measurement on the responded systems. When each of the n servers stores a copy of every file, the QPIR/QSPIR capacity with multiple non-colluding\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

On the other hand, when the files are stored in a distributed storage system coded by an [n, k] maximum distance separable (MDS) code, QSPIR schemes with colluding servers are constructed [24], but the result was limited to the case t + k = n.\nA. Contributions\nAs a generalization of [24], we study the QPIR/QSPIR capacity from [n, k] MDS coded storage with t colluding servers for any t + k \u2264 n. Since the capacity of this setting is even unsolved for the classical case, similar to [9] and [10], we define two new classes of QPIR, which include the existing QPIR schemes [21]\u2013[24], and derive the capacity for these classes. The first class is stabilizer QPIR induced from classical PIR. Stabilizer QPIR is a class of QPIR that naturally imports linear PIR schemes in quantum settings while doubling the PIR rate. More specifically, the user and the servers simulate the classical PIR scheme, except that the servers\u2019 prior entangled state is a state in a stabilizer code and the servers apply Pauli X and Z operations on each quantum system depending on the answers of the classical PIR. The second class is dimension-squared QPIR, which is a broader class of QPIR that includes stabilizer QPIR. Whereas the stabilizer QPIR is defined with restrictions on the encoding, decoding, and shared entanglement, dimension-squared QPIR is defined only with restriction on dimensions of the answered quantum systems, which is a sufficient condition for our converse proof. Similar to the stabilizer QPIR, dimension-squared QPIR can also be induced from classical PIR and the existing QPIR schemes [21]\u2013[24] are dimension-squared QPIR induced from strongly linear PIR.\nFor stabilizer QPIR and dimension-squared QPIR induced from strongly-linear PIR, we prove that the asymptotic QPIR/QSPIR capacities with MDS-coded and colluding servers are min{1, 2(n \u2212 k \u2212 t + 1)/n}. Furthermore, for non-colluding case t = 1, we prove that the general asymptotic QPIR/QSPIR capacity is min{1, 2(n \u2212 k)/n}. The derived quantum capacities double the classical asymptotic capacities of PIR and SPIR, as compared in Table I.\nThe capacity achieving scheme is based on the stronglylinear star-product scheme of [12] for classical PIR from MDS-coded storage and the QPIR scheme of [23] for replicated storage, both in the presence of t colluding servers. A generalization of these schemes, which employs (weakly)\nself-dual Generalized Reed\u2013Solomon (GRS) codes, results in the first known QPIR scheme from MDS-coded storage in the considered setting. The scheme is non-trivial for two main reasons. First, the chosen codes must behave well with the star-product operation: one example is the polynomial-based codes class, that includes GRS codes. This requirement comes from the classical PIR scheme described in [12]. Second, the star-product of the storage code and the query code must be a (weakly) self-dual code in order to employ the stabilizer formalism and get the advantage of quantum communication. To the best of our knowledge the combination of these two properties was not considered in previous literature. In this paper, we prove that for any given GRS storage code we can find a GRS query code such that their star-product is a (weakly) self-dual code.\nThe converse bounds are proved separately for the colluding and non-colluding cases. First, the converse for colluding case is derived generally for any PIR classes. Namely, when the classical capacity of any PIR class is C, we prove that the rates of stabilizer QPIR and dimension-squared QPIR induced from the same class of PIR are upper bounded by min{1, 2C}. Then, from the capacity of strongly linear PIR for coded and colluding servers (n \u2212 k \u2212 t + 1)/n [9], [10], we obtain our converse bound for colluding case. Second, the converse for non-colluding case is proved for general QPIR schemes with the following idea. We prove that the k servers obtain negligible information of the user\u2019s information. Combining this fact and the entanglement-assisted classical capacity [26], we prove that the desired converse bound C \u2264 min{1, 2(n\u2212 k)/n}.\nSimilar to the existing multi-server QPIR studies [21]\u2013[24], the communication model in this paper is classical query and quantum answers with entanglement. This model is the hybrid model of classical and quantum communication for classical file retrieval. Compared to the non-quantum model, our main theorem implies that the capacity doubles only with the one-way quantum communication from the servers to the user. On the other hand, compared to the purely quantum model, which allows quantum queries, our model has three practical advantages. First, since the quantum communication is hard to be implemented with the current technology, our one-way communication model is a more realizable model than the two-way quantum communication. Second, in our scheme, most of the quantum resources and computations are operated by the servers, and the only\nquantum device required for the user is a fixed measurement apparatus.1 The same kind of outsourcing also appears in the computation by measurement-based quantum computation [28]. Third, since the storage is still classical, we can just employ quantum communication technology and quantum memory to double the rate of an already existing MDS-coded storage implementing a classical PIR scheme.\nB. Organization\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II is a preliminary section for notation, linear codes and distributed data storage, quantrum information theory, and stabilizer formalism. In Section III, we formally define classical PIR, QPIR, and the related QPIR classes. In Section IV, we present our main capacity results. Our capacity-achieving QPIR scheme with MDS-coded storage and colluding servers is proposed in Section V and the converse bound is derived in Section VI. Section VII is the conclusion of the paper."

Notation\nWe denote by [n] and [n1:n2] the sets {1, 2, . . . , n}, n \u2208 N and {n1, n1 + 1, . . . , n2}, n1, n2 \u2208 N, respectively, and by Fq the finite field of q elements. For a linear code of length n and dimension k over Fq we write [n, k]. For random variables A1, . . . , An, quantum systems A1, . . . ,An and a set S \u2282 [n], we denote AS := (Aj |j \u2208 S) and AS := j\u2208S Aj . For a matrix A we write A for its transpose and A\u2020 for its conjugate transpose. The function \u03b4i,j is the Kronecker delta and I\u03bd is the \u03bd \u00d7 \u03bd identity matrix. For an n \u00d7 m matrix A = (aij)i\u2208[n],j\u2208[m], S1 \u2282 [n], and S2 \u2282 [m], we denote AS1S2 = (aij)i\u2208S1,j\u2208S2 and A\nS1 = (aij)i\u2208S1,j\u2208[m], AS2 = (aij)i\u2208[n],j\u2208S2 . Throughout this paper, we use log for the logarithm to the base 2.\nB. Linear Codes and Distributed Data Storage\nWe consider a distributed storage system employing error/erasure correcting codes to protect against data loss. To this end, let X be an m\u03b2 \u00d7 k matrix containing m files Xi \u2208 F\u03b2\u00d7kq , i \u2208 [m]. This matrix is encoded with a linear code C of length n and dimension k over Fq. The m\u03b2 \u00d7 n matrix of encoded files is given by Y = X \u00b7 GC , where GC \u2208 Fk\u00d7nq is the generator matrix of C. Server s \u2208 [n] stores the s-th column of Y, which is denoted by Ys.\nIn this work we consider systems encoded with MDS codes. A linear code C is called an MDS code if any k columns of the generator matrix GC are linearly independent. Since we consider a MDS coded data storage, we have the following properties.\n1) The matrix Xi can be recovered from any k elements of {Yi1, . . . ,Yin} for any i \u2208 [m]. 2) Any k columns of Y are linearly independent.\n1QPIR problem can also be considered for the retrieval of quantum states, i.e., QPIR with quantum storage. A part of authors discussed this problem in a recent paper [27].\nC. Preliminaries on Quantum Information Theory In this subsection, we introduce the preliminaries on quan-\ntum information theory. To be precise, we introduce quantum systems, states, operations, and measurements. Further, after the introduction, we explain the quantum information theory is a generalization of classical information theory. For more details the reader is referred to [29] and [30].\nA quantum system H is represented by a finite dimensional complex vector space. Vectors in a quantum system are written with bra-ket notation as |\u03c8 \u2208 H and their complex conjugates are as \u03c8|. The computational basis of a d-dimensional quantum system H is a fixed orthonormal basis written as {|0 , . . . , |d\u22121 }. The composite system of multiple quantum systems H1, . . . ,Hn is represented by the tensor product H1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 Hn.\nA state \u03c3 on H is represented by a positive-semidefinite matrix on H with trace 1, which is called a density matrix. When a density matrix \u03c3 is a rank-one matrix, i.e., \u03c3 = |\u03c8 \u03c8|, the state is equivalently represented by a unit vector |\u03c8 , called a pure state. When a state is not a pure state, the state is called a mixed state. On a composite system H1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297Hn, a state is called separable if the state is written as \u03c3 =\ni pi\u03c31 \u2297\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 \u03c3n with pi \u2265 0, i pi = 1, and density matrices \u03c3i for all i. A state on a composite system is called entangled if it is not a separable state. When the state on H1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297Hn is \u03c3, the reduced state on Hk is written as Trkc\u03c3, where Trkc is the partial trace over\ni =kHi.\nA quantum operation \u03ba from H1 to H2 is represented by completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) map defined as follows. A linear map \u03ba from matrices on H1 to matrices on H2 is called completely positive if for all positive integer n, the map \u03ba\u2297 idCn maps positive-semidefinite matrices to positivesemidefinite matrices, where idCn is the identity map over the matrices on idCn , and trace-preserving if Tr(\u03ba(M)) = Tr(M) for all matrices M on H1. A CPTP map \u03ba is called a unitary map if \u03ba(M) = U \u2020MU with a unitary matrix U on H.\nA measurement on a quantum system H is represented by a set of positive-semidefinite matrices M = {M\u03c9}\u03c9\u2208\u03a9 on H with\n\u03c9M\u03c9 = I , called a positive operation-valued\nmeasure (POVM). When a POVM is performed on a state \u03c3, the measurement outcome is \u03c9 with probability Tr(M\u03c9\u03c3M\u03c9). If all elements of a POVM {M\u03c9}\u03c9\u2208\u03a9 are orthogonal projections, the POVM is called the projection-valued measure (PVM).\nClassical information theory is included in the framework of quantum information theory in the following sense. A finite set [0 : d \u2212 1] corresponds to a d-dimensional quantum system with computational basis {|0 , . . . , |d\u2212 1 }. An instance x \u2208 [0 : d \u2212 1] and a random variable X with probability {px|x \u2208 [0 : d \u2212 1]} correspond, respectively, to a pure state |x and a mixed state \u03c3 =\nx\u2208[0:d\u22121] px|x x|.\nA transition matrix Q = (Qx,y)x\u2208[0:d\u22121],y\u2208[0:d \u22121], which satisfies Qx,y \u2208 [0, 1] and y Qx,y = 1, corresponds to a CPTP map \u03ba(\u03c3) =\nx,yQx,y|y x|\u03c3|x y|. For example, if the state \u03c3 corresponds to the random variable X , i.e., \u03c3 =\nx\u2208[0:d\u22121] px|x x|, the resultant state after applying \u03ba is\ny( x pxQx,y)|y y|, i.e., the random variable after applying Q on X . Sampling a random variable X with the outcome\nx corresponds to performing PVM M = {Px = |x x|} and obtaining the measurement outcome x with probability px.\nD. Stabilizer Formalism\nStabilizer formalism is an algebraic structure in quantum information theory and is often used for the quantum error correction [31], [32]. In the context of QPIR, it is also an essential tool to design most of the existing multi-server QPIR schemes [21]\u2013[24]. With the stabilizer formalism, we will define a new class of QPIR, called stabilizer QPIR in Section III-B.1, and design our capacity-achieving schemes in Section V. As a preliminary, in this section, we first define stabilizer formalism over finite fields Fq. Then, to help understanding how the mathematical definition of the stabilizer formalism is used for information processing tasks, we briefly explain the application to the quantum error correction.\n1) Stabilizer Formalism Over Finite Fields: Let q = pr with a prime number p and a positive integer r. Let H be a q-dimensional Hilbert space spanned by orthonormal states {|j |j \u2208 Fq}. For x \u2208 Fq, we define Tx on Frp as the linear map y \u2208 Fq \u2192 xy \u2208 Fq by identifying the finite field Fq with the vector space Frp. Let tr x := TrTx \u2208 Fp for x \u2208 Fq. Let \u03c9 := exp(2\u03c0i/p). For a, b \u2208 Fq, we define unitary matrices X(a) :=\nj\u2208Fq |j + a j| and Z(b) := j\u2208Fq \u03c9 tr bj |j j| on H. For s = (s1, . . . , s2n) \u2208 F2nq , we define a unitary matrix W\u0303(s) := X(s1)Z(sn+1) \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 X(sn)Z(s2n) on H\u2297n. For x = (x1, . . . , xn), y = (y1, . . . , yn) \u2208 Fnq , we define the tracial bilinear form x,y := tr\nn i=1 xiyi \u2208 Fp and the\ntrace-symplectic bilinear form x,y S := x,Jy , where J is a 2n \u00d7 2n matrix\nJ = 0 \u2212In In 0 .\nThe Heisenberg-Weyl group is defined as HWnq := {\u2217}cW\u0303(s)|s \u2208 F2nq , c \u2208 C. A commutative subgroup of HWnq not containing cIqn for any c = 0 is called a stabilizer. A subspace V of F2nq is called self-orthogonal with respect to the bilinear form \u00b7, \u00b7 S if V \u2282 V\u22a5S := {s \u2208 F2nq | v, s S = 0 for any v \u2208 V}. Any self-orthogonal subspace of F2nq defines a stabilizer by the following proposition.\nProposition 2.1 ([23, Sec. IV-A]): Let V be a self-orthogonal subspace of F2nq . There exists {cv \u2208 C|v \u2208 V} such that\nS(V) := {W(v) := cvW\u0303(v)|v \u2208 V} \u2282 HWnq (1)\nis a stabilizer. In the next proposition, we denote the elements of the quotient space F2nq /V\u22a5S by s := s + V\u22a5S \u2208 F2nq /V\u22a5S . Proposition 2.2 ([23, Sec. IV-A]): Let V be a ddimensional self-orthogonal subspace of F2nq and S(V) be a stabilizer defined from Proposition 2.1. Then, we obtain the following statements.\n(a) For any v \u2208 V , the operation W(v) \u2208 S(V) is simultaneously and uniquely decomposed as\nW(v) = s\u2208F2nq /V\u22a5S \u03c9 v,s SPVs (2)\nwith orthogonal projections {PVs } such that\nPVs P V t\n= 0 for any s = t, (3) s\u2208F2nq /V\u22a5S PVs = Iqn .

We have dimHVs = qn\u2212d for any s \u2208 F2nq /V\u22a5S and the quantum system H\u2297n is decomposed as\nH\u2297n = s\u2208F2nq /V\u22a5S HVs = W \u2297 Cq n\u2212d , (5)\nwhere the system W is the qd-dimensional Hilbert space spanned by {|s |s \u2208 F2nq /V\u22a5S} with the property HVs = |s \u2297 Cqn\u2212d := {|s \u2297 |\u03c8 ||\u03c8 \u2208 Cqn\u2212d}.\n(c) For any s, t \u2208 F2nq , we have\nW(t)|s \u2297 Cqn\u2212d = |s + t \u2297 Cqn\u2212d , (6) W(t)\n|s s| \u2297 Iqn\u2212d W(t)\u2020 = |s + t s + t| \u2297 Iqn\u2212d .\n(7)\n(d) For any v \u2208 V and any |\u03c8 \u2208 |0 \u2297 Cqn\u2212d , we have\nW(v)|\u03c8 = |\u03c8 . (8) 2) Application to Quantum Error Correction: Next,\nwe explain how the stabilizer formalism is used for quantum error correction [31], [32]. Similar to the classical case, the structure of error correction will be used for accomplishing PIR tasks in the later sections.\nConsider the transmission of a quantum state from a sender to a receiver over a noisy channel. When the sender\u2019s message state is \u03c3 on Cq n\u2212d , the sender encodes the state \u03c3 as |0 0|\u2297\u03c3 on the quantum system |0 \u2297 Cqn\u2212d \u2282 H\u2297n defined in (b) of Proposition 2.2, and send the quantum system H\u2297n to the receiver. Suppose the noise of the channel is W(s), i.e., the operation W(s) is applied to the state. Then, the receiver\u2019s state is in the space |s \u2297Cqn\u2212d by (c) of Proposition 2.2. For the decoding of the error, the receiver detects s by performing the PVM measurement {PVs |s \u2208 F2nq /V}, defined from the projections in (a) of Proposition 2.2. This PVM is called syndrome measurement in the similar context to the classical error correction. Then, the receiver applies error correction by choosing an element s \u2208 s and applying W(\u2212s ), which maps the received state to the original space |0 \u2297Cqn\u2212d . Since the noise and error correction operation are combined as the unitray matrix W(s)W(\u2212s ) = W(s\u2212 s ), if s\u2212 s \u2208 V , the decoded state is |0 0|\u2297\u03c3 from (d) of Proposition 2.2. That is, \u03c3 is correctly recovered by the receiver. The characterization of the noise s and the corresponding choice of s in decoding are essential problem in quantum error correction to achieve more reliable communication."

            "text": "A. Classical PIR\nWe formally define a classical PIR scheme with MDS-coded storage (MDS-PIR). In a general MDS-PIR scheme, one user and n servers participate.\nDistributed Storage The m files are given as uniformly and independently distributed random variables X1, . . . , Xm in F\u03b2\u00d7kq . As described in Section II-B, the files X = ((X1) , . . . , (Xm) ) are encoded with an MDS code C as Y = (Y1, . . . , Yn) = XGC \u2208 F\u03b2m\u00d7nq and is distributed as the s-th server contains Ys \u2208 F\u03b2mq . Shared Randomness The servers possibly share randomness H = (H1, . . . , Hn), where Hs is owned by server s. Query Let K be a uniform random variable with values in [m]. The user desiring the K-th file XK prepares QK = (QK1 , . . . , Q K n ) with local randomness R by\nthe encoder Encuser:[m]\u00d7R \u2192 Q := Q1\u00d7\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u00d7Qn, where R is the alphabet of the user\u2019s local randomness and Qs is the alphabet of the query to server s, and sends QKs to server s.\nResponse With the encoder Encservs :F \u03b2m q \u00d7Hs\u00d7Qs \u2192 Bs, the\ns-th server responds BKs = Encservs(Ys, Hs, Qs) \u2208 Bs to the user. We denote BK = (BK1 , . . . , BKn ) and B = B1 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 Bn.\nDecoding With the decoder Dec:[m] \u00d7 Q \u00d7 B \u2192 F\u03b2\u00d7kq , the user obtains an estimate X\u0302K = Dec(K,QK , BK) \u2208 F\u03b2\u00d7kq of X K .\nAs described above, an MDS-PIR scheme \u03a6 is defined as \u03a6C = (C, \u03c3init,Encuser,Encserv,Dec) with the MDS code for storage C, the initial state \u03c3init, the query encoder of the user Encuser, the answer encoders of the servers Encserv := {Encservs |\u2200s \u2208 [n]}, and the decoder of the user Dec.\nThe correctness of MDS-PIR is defined as follows. Definition 3.1 (Correctness): The correctness of a\nMDS-PIR scheme \u03a6C is evaluated by the error probability\nPerr(\u03a6C) := max \u03b9\u2208[m] Pr[X\u03b9 = X\u0302\u03b9]. (9) We also consider the following secrecy conditions with a positive integer t with 1 \u2264 t < n. Definition 3.2 (Privacy With t-Collusion): User t-secrecy:\nAny set of at most t colluding servers gains no information about the index \u03b9 of the desired file, i.e., pQT |K=\u03b9 = pQT |K=\u03b9 for any \u03b9, \u03b9 \u2208 [m] and T \u2282 [n] with |T | \u2264 t, where pQT |K=\u03b9 is the distribution of QT conditioned with K = \u03b9.\nServer secrecy: The user does not gain any information about the files other than the requested one, i.e.,\nI(B\u03b9;X |Q\u03b9,K = \u03b9) = H(X\u03b9). (10) As customary, we assume that the size of the query alphabet\nis negligible compared to the size of the files. This is well justified if the files are assumed to be large, as the upload cost is independent of the size of the files. For simplicity, we only consider files of sizes k\u03b2 log q in the following. However, note that repeatedly applying the scheme with the same queries allows for the download of files that are any multiple of k\u03b2 log q in size at the same rate and without additional upload cost.\nWhen user t-secrecy is satisfied, the scheme is called [n, k, t]-PIR and leaks no information of the index K to any t colluding servers. When both user t-secrecy and server secrecy are satisfied, the scheme is called symmetric and we denote it by [n, k, t]-SPIR.\nAs a measure of efficiency of the MDS-PIR scheme \u03a6C is defined as follows.\nDefinition 3.3 (MDS-PIR Rate): The MDS-PIR scheme \u03a6C is defined as\nR(\u03a6C) = H(X i) n j=1 log |B| . (11)\nDefinition 3.4 (Achievable MDS-PIR Rate): A rate R is called -error achievable [n, k, t]-PIR ([n, k, t]-SPIR) rate with m files if there exists a sequence of [n, k, t]-PIR ([n, k, t]SPIR) schemes with m files {\u03a6 } such that the PIR rate R(\u03a6 ) approaches R and the error probability satisfies lim \u2192\u221e Perr(\u03a6 ) \u2264 .\nDefinition 3.5 (MDS-PIR Capacity): The -error [n, k, t]PIR ([n, k, t]-SPIR) capacity with m files C [n,k,t]m, ,cl (C [n,k,t],s m, ,cl ) is the supremum of -error achievable [n, k, t]-PIR ([n, k, t]SPIR) rate with m files.\nRemark 1: Our definition of the achievable rate and capacity with asymptotic error generalizes the case of = 0, which have been discussed in other PIR studies [3], [6].\nWe define two well-known classes of classical PIR. For a set I \u2286 [n] and \u03b3 \u2208 N, we define \u03c8\u03b3(I) := i\u2208I [(i\u22121)\u03b3+1:i\u03b3]. For example, if I = [n], we have \u03c8\u03b3([n]) = [\u03b3n]. Definition 3.6 (Linear PIR [9, Definition 1]): A PIR sche-\nme is called linear if\n\u2022 the query Q is represented by a matrix Q \u2208 F\u03b2m\u00d7\u03b3nq , where Q\u03c8\u03b3(s) is the query to server s, and \u2022 the classical answer Bs of server s is represented by\nB\u03c8\u03b3(s) = Y s Q\u03c8\u03b3(s) \u2208 F1\u00d7\u03b3q . (12)\nWe also define strongly linear PIR, which requires the linearity also for the reconstruction of the targeted file.\nDefinition 3.7 (Strongly Linear PIR [9]): A linear PIR scheme is called strongly linear if there exist linear maps {fi,j|(i, j) \u2208 [\u03b2] \u00d7 [k]} such that\nXij = fi,j (B(s\u22121)\u03b3+ti,j |s \u2208 [n]) for some ti,j \u2208 [\u03b3].\nOne of our main results is on the MDS-QPIR capacity induced from strongly linear PIR. The capacity of strongly linear PIR is derived in [9] as follows.\nProposition 3.1 ([9], [10]): The zero-error capacity of any strongly linear PIR with [n, k]-MDS coded storage and t colluding servers is\nsup k\u03b2 log q n i=1H(Bi) = 1 \u2212 k + t \u2212 1 n\n(13)\nfor any number of files m.\nB. Quantum PIR (QPIR)\n1) QPIR From MDS-Coded Storage: We formally define a QPIR scheme with MDS-coded storage (MDS-QPIR), depicted in Figure 1.\nDistributed Storage The same as classical PIR. Shared Entanglement The initial state of the n servers is\ngiven as a density matrix \u03c3init on quantum system H = H1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 Hn, where Hs is distributed to server s. The state \u03c3init is possibly entangled.\nQuery The same as classical PIR. Response Each server s applies a CPTP map Encservs [Q K s , Ys]\nfrom Hs to As depending on QKs and Ys, where As is a d-dimensional quantum system, and returns As to the user.\nDecoding Depending on K and QK , the user applies a POVM Dec[K,QK ] on A = A1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297An and obtains the measurement outcome X\u0302K .\nAs described above, an MDS-QPIR scheme \u03a6 is defined as \u03a6 = (C, \u03c3init,Encuser,Encserv,Dec) with the MDS code for storage C, the initial state \u03c3init, the query encoder of the user Encuser, the answer encoders of the servers Encserv := {Encservs |\u2200s \u2208 [n]}, and the decoding measurement of the user Dec.\nDefinition 3.8: The correctness, privacy, rate, and capacity of QPIR are defined in the same way as Definitions 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.5, respectively, except that (10) and (11) are replaced as\nI(A;X |Q\u03b9,K = \u03b9) = H(X\u03b9), (14)\nand\nR(\u03a6) = H(X i) n\nj=1 log dimA . (15)\nNotation 3.1: We denote by C[n,k,t]m, (C [n,k,t],s m, ) the -error [n, k, t]-QPIR ([n, k, t]-QSPIR) capacity with m files.\nIn Definition 3.2, user t-secrecy is defined as the independence of the index K and the queries QT of the colluding servers. Although this user secrecy condition is natural in classical PIR, one may be unsure whether this condition is sufficient for the QPIR setting because the servers share quantum entanglement. To justify this condition in the QPIR setting, we consider the malicious scenario where the servers apply malicious operations on the answered systems in order to extract the information of the user\u2019s request K . Even in this malicious scenario, the servers cannot exploit entanglement to break the user\u2019s secrecy because of the no-signaling principle [33]. No-signaling principle states that two parties sharing an entangled state cannot communicate any information from their local measurements. From this principle, even if the colluding servers share entanglement with the other servers or\nthe user throughout the scheme, the only information obtained by the colluding servers is the queries QT . Thus, the user t-secrecy condition guarantees the secrecy of K from the colluding servers.\n2) Example of QPIR Scheme: With stabilizer formalism, we give an example of two-server QPIR, which corresponds to the QPIR scheme in [21]. Let H1 and H2 be two-dimensional quantum systems, which are also called qubits. From Proposition 2.1, we define a stabilizer on H1 \u2297 H2 with the self-orthogonal subspace\nV = {(0, 0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1, 1)} \u2282 F42.\nThe space V satisfies V = V\u22a5S . With this stabilzer, we set the initial entangled state of the two servers as |0 \u2208 H1 \u2297 H2, where s = s + V\u22a5S for all s \u2208 F42. The two servers have H1 and H2, respectively. The files are prepared as mi = (miX ,miZ) \u2208 F22 for all i \u2208 [m]. For querying the k-th file, the user sends queries\nq1 = (ek, ek) + r \u2208 F2m2 , (16) q2 = r \u2208 F2m2 , (17)\nwhere ek is the k-th standard vector in Fm2 and r is a random vector in F2m2 . After receiving queries, the servers generates\n(a1, b1) = q1 \u00b7m = mk + r \u00b7m, (18) (a2, b2) = q2 \u00b7m = r \u00b7 m, (19)\nwhere m = ((m1X ,m2X , . . . ,mmX), (m1Z ,m2Z , . . . ,mmZ)) \u2208 F2m2 . Then, the server i applies X(ai)Z(bi) on Hi and sends Hi to the user. The user receives the states\nW\u0303(a1, a2, b1, b2)|0 = |(a1, a2, b1, b2) (20) = |(mkX , 0,mkZ , 0) , (21)\nwhere the first equality follows from (6) and the second equality follows from (1, 1, 1, 1) \u2208 V\u22a5S = V . By applying measurement on the received state, the user retrieves mk = (mkX ,mkZ) \u2208 F22 correctly. The user secrecy is satisfied from the query structure, and the server secrecy is satisfied because the user\u2019s state only depends on mk as in (21). The QPIR rate is 1 because 2 bits are retrieved and 2 qubits are downloaded.\n3) Classes of QPIR: As a general class of QPIR schemes, we introduce a new class called stabilizer QPIR, which includes the example in Section III-B.2 and most of the known multi-server QPIR schemes [21]\u2013[24].\nDefinition 3.9 (Stabilizer QPIR): A QPIR scheme is called a stabilizer QPIR induced from a classical PIR scheme \u03a6C if\n\u2022 the initial state of the servers \u03c3init is a state in HV0 = |0 \u2297 Cqn\u2212d \u2282 H\u2297n defined with a self-orthogonal subspace V by Proposition 2.2,\n\u2022 the query is the same as \u03a6C , and \u2022 the s-th server\u2019s operation is the Weyl operation\nX(as)Z(bs), where (as, bs) \u2208 F2q is the s-th server\u2019s answer of \u03a6C . In Section V, we construct a stabilizer QPIR scheme, which achieves the capacities in Corollaries 4.1 and 4.2.\nFurther, we define a more general class of QPIR as follows.\nDefinition 3.10 (Dimension-Squared QPIR): A QPIR scheme is said to be dimension-squared if the s-th server\u2019s operation is determined by classical information Bs \u2208 Bs with |Bs| \u2264 d2 for all s \u2208 [n].\nFurthermore, if B = (B1, . . . , Bn) is the answer of a classical PIR scheme \u03a6C and the query of the QPIR scheme is the same as \u03a6C , the QPIR scheme is called a dimensionsquared QPIR induced from the classical PIR scheme \u03a6C .\nAny stabilizer QPIR scheme is a dimension-squared scheme induced from a classical PIR scheme. Accordingly, the example in Section III-B.2 and the multi-server QPIR schemes [21]\u2013[24] are also dimension-squared schemes induced from strongly linear schemes. In Section VI, we derive the converse bound for dimension-squared QPIR schemes.\nWhen a classical PIR scheme \u03a6C induces a QPIR scheme without the condition of dimensions, then the scheme can be modified to induce dimension-squared QPIR in the following way. First, we make the n answers the same size by repeating \u03a6C multiple times while reordering the roles of the servers for all possible cases. Let d be the size of one answer and \u03a6 C be the repeated PIR scheme. Again, let \u03a6 C be the PIR scheme made by repeating \u03a6 C d times, and then, the size of each answer of \u03a6 C is (d )2. Thus, a dimension-squared QPIR scheme \u03a6Q is induced from \u03a6 C if \u03a6Q can be made to satisfy the correctness condition. For convenience, we consider a dimension-squared QPIR scheme induced from \u03a6 C as induced from \u03a6C .\nNotation 3.2: We denote by C[n,k,t]m, ,stab, C [n,k,t] m, ,dim (C [n,k,t],s m, ,stab, C [n,k,t],s m, ,dim) the -error [n, k, t]-QPIR ([n, k, t]-QSPIR) capacities of stabilizer QPIR induced from strongly linear PIR and dimension-squared QPIR induced from strongly linear PIR.\nFrom the definitions, the capacities are decreasing for t and increasing for , and satisfy\nC [n,k,t],s m, ,stab \u2264 C [n,k,t],s m, ,dim \u2264 C [n,k,t],sm, \u2264 \u2264 \u2264\n(22)\nC [n,k,t] m, ,stab \u2264 C [n,k,t] m, ,dim \u2264 C [n,k,t]m, ."

            "heading": "IV. MAIN RESULTS",
            "text": "In this section, we give our two main results of the paper. The first result is the asymptotic capacity of stabilizer QPIR and dimension-squared QPIR induced from strongly linear PIR. The second result is the general asymptotic capacity without collusion, i.e., the case t = 1. Before our capacity result, we state a general upper bound of dimension-squared QPIR capacity.\nTheorem 4.1 (Converse for Dimension-Squared QPIR Induced From Classical PIR): Let A be a set of assumptions on classical PIR and C [A] be the -error capacity of the classical PIR with assumptions A. Then, for any \u2208 [0, 1), the -error capacity of dimension-squared QPIR induced from classical -error PIR with the assumptions A is upper bounded by min{1, 2C [A]}.\nTheorem 4.1 will be proved in Section VI-A. Notice that Theorem 4.1 is proved for dimension-squared QPIR induced from any classical PIR class. Intuitively, the dimensional condition in the dimension-squared QPIR is the key factor for doubling the capacity of any classical PIR. On the other hand, it should be noted that classical PIR schemes do not necessarily induce QPIR schemes, i.e., the existence and the construction of QPIR induced from the classical PIR is not trivial as discussed in Section I-A.\nOur first capacity result is on the capacities of stabilizer QPIR and dimension-squared QPIR induced from strongly linear PIR. An upper bound of the capacities C[n,k,t]m, ,dim and C [n,k,t],s m, ,dim is derived by Theorem 4.1 and Proposition 3.1 as\nC [n,k,t] m,0,dim, C [n,k,t],s m,0,dim \u2264 2\n1 \u2212 k + t \u2212 1\nn\n. (23)\nFurthermore, we prove the following theorem in Section V. Theorem 4.2 (Achievability): Let n, k, t be positive integers with 1 \u2264 n/2 \u2264 k + t \u2212 1 < n. There exists a stabilizer QPIR scheme induced from strongly linear PIR with [n, k]MDS coded storage and t-colluding servers achieving (23) with equality for any number of files m and without error. Combining Eqs. (22), (23), and Theorem 4.2, we obtain the first capacity result.\nCorollary 4.1 (MDS-Q(S)PIR Capacity With Colluding Servers): Let n, k, t be positive integers such that 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n and 1 \u2264 t < n. Then, for any Cm,0 \u2208 {C [n,k,t]m,0,stab, C [n,k,t],s m,0,stab, C [n,k,t] m,0,dim, C [n,k,t],s m,0,dim},\nCm,0 = \u23a7\u23a8 \u23a9 1 if k + t \u2212 1 \u2264 n/2, 2\n1 \u2212 k + t \u2212 1 n\notherwise.\n(24)\nIn Corollary 4.1, the case for k + t\u2212 1 \u2264 n/2 is proved as follows. When k+ t\u22121 = n/2, Theorem 4.2 proves the rate 1 is achievable. If t \u2264 t , the QPIR scheme for t colluding servers also has the user secrecy against t colluding servers. Therefore, when k+t\u22121 \u2264 n/2, we can apply the scheme for k+ t \u22121 = n/2 with n even to achieve the rate 1. Finally, the tightness of the rate 1 follows trivially from definition. If n is odd, we just consider n \u2212 1 servers and t = (n + 1)/2 \u2212 k in order to achieve rate 1.\nAs the second result, when no servers collude, i.e., t = 1, we prove the general asymptotic capacity theorem. Without\nthe assumption of dimension-squared QPIR, we prove the following upper bound of QPIR.\nTheorem 4.3 (Converse of QPIR Without Collusion): Let n, k be positive integers with 1 \u2264 n/2 \u2264 k < n. Then, we have\nlim \u21920 lim m\u2192\u221e C [n,k,1]m, \u2264 2 1 \u2212 k n . (25)\nTheorem 4.3 will be proved in Section VI-A. Combining Eq. (22), Theorem 4.3, and Theorem 4.2 for the case t = 1, we obtain the second capacity result.\nCorollary 4.2 (MDS-Q(S)PIR Capacity): Let n, k be positive integers such that 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n. For any Cm, \u2208 {C [n,k,1]m, ,stab, C [n,k,1],s m, ,stab , C [n,k,1] m, ,dim, C [n,k,1],s m, ,dim , C [n,k,1] m, , C [n,k,1],s m, },\nlim \u21920 lim m\u2192\u221e Cm, = \u23a7\u23a8 \u23a9 1 if k \u2264 n/2, 2\n1 \u2212 k n\notherwise.\n(26)\nIn Corollary 4.2, the smallest capacity in the six capacities is C [n,k,1],sm, ,stab from (22), and this value is asymptotically lower bounded by the RHS of (26) from Theorem 4.2. On the other hand, the greatest capacity is C [n,k,1]m, , which is upper bounded by the RHS of (26) from Theorem 4.3."

[34, Ch. 10]), a popular class of MDS codes.\nDefinition 5.1: Let L = {\u03b1i \u2208 Fq:i \u2208 [n]} and M = {\u03b2i \u2208 Fq:i \u2208 [n]} be the sets of the code locators and of the column multipliers, respectively. The Generalized Reed\u2013 Solomon (GRS) code C of dimension k is given by C = {(\u03b21f(\u03b11), . . . , \u03b2nf(\u03b1n)):f \u2208 Fq[x], deg(f) < k}. Among coded storage systems, these have proven to be\nparticularly well-suited for PIR and general schemes exist for a wide range of parameters [11], [12], [35]. The key idea is to design the queries such that the retrieved symbols are the sum of a codeword of another GRS code (of higher dimension), which we refer to as the star-product code, plus a vector depending only on the desired file. To obtain the desired file, the codeword part is projected to zero, leaving only the desired part of the responses. In the QPIR system we consider in the following, this projection is part of the quantum measurement. This imposes a constraint on this starproduct code, namely, that the code is (weakly) self-dual. In the following, we collect/establish the required theoretical results on GRS codes and their star-products.\nDefinition 5.2 (Weakly Self-Dual Code): We say that an [n, k] code C is weakly self-dual if C\u22a5 \u2286 C and self-dual if C\u22a5 = C. It is easy to see that any such code with parity-check matrix H has a generator matrix of the form G = (H F ) for some (2k \u2212 n) \u00d7 n matrix F. Lemma 5.1 (Follows From [36, Theorem 3]): For q = 2r there exist self-dual GRS [2k, k] codes over Fq for any k \u2208 [2r\u22121] and code locators L.\nLemma 5.2: Let q be even with q \u2265 n. Then there exists a weakly self-dual [n, k] GRS code C for any integer k \u2265 n2 and code locators L.\nProof: First consider the case of even n. Let S be an [n, n/2] self-dual GRS code with code locators L \u2286 Fq, as shown to exist in [36, Theorem 3] (see Lemma 5.1). It is easy to see that this code is a subcode of the [n, k] GRS code C with the same locators and column multipliers. The property C\u22a5 \u2282 C follows directly from observing that C\u22a5 \u2286 S\u22a5 = S \u2286 C.\nNow consider the case of odd n. First, observe that this implies n < q and n2 = n+1 2 . Then, by Lemma 5.1, there exists a self-dual [n+1, n2 ] GRS code S with code locators L = L\u222a{\u03b1}, where \u03b1 \u2208 Fq \\L. Let j \u2208 [n+1] be the index of the position corresponding to \u03b1. Now consider the code C obtained from puncturing this position j, i.e., the set\nS = {c[n+1]\\{j} | c \u2208 S }. It is well-known that the operation dual to puncturing is shortening and therefore the corresponding [n, n2 \u2212 1] dual code S\u22a5 is given by\nS\u22a5 = {c[n+1]\\{j} | cj = 0, c \u2208 (S )\u22a5} = {c[n+1]\\{j} | cj = 0, c \u2208 S }.\nClearly, this operation preserves the weak duality, i.e., S\u22a5 \u2282 S. Again, it is easy to see that S is a subcode of the [n, k]\nGRS code C with the same locators and column multipliers for any k \u2265 n2 . The statement follows from observing that we have C\u22a5 \u2286 S\u22a5 \u2282 S \u2286 C\nLemma 5.3: Let q be even with q \u2265 n. For any [n, k] GRS code C there exists an [n, t] GRS code D such that their starproduct S = C D is an [n, k + t \u2212 1] weakly self-dual GRS code.\nProof: By [37] the star product between an [n, k] GRS code C with column multipliers MC and an [n, t] GRS code D with column multipliers MD, both with the same locators L, is the [n, k + t \u2212 1] GRS code with column multipliers MC MD and code locators L. Denote by MS the column multipliers of a weakly-self dual [n, k+ t\u2212 1] GRS code with code locators L, as shown to exist in Lemma 5.2. Then, the lemma statement follows from setting MD = (MC)\u22121 MS , where we denote by (MC)\u22121 the element-wise inverse of MC.\nB. Description of the Coded QPIR Scheme\nIn this subsection we describe the required preliminaries for the capacity-achieving QPIR scheme. Afterwards, we give a compact list of the steps followed by the protocol.\n1) Storage: We consider a linear code C of length 2n and dimension 2k, which is the Cartesian product of an [n, k] GRS code C over Fq with itself,2 i.e., C = C \u00d7 C . It therefore has a generator matrix GC = diag (GC ,GC ), where GC is a generator matrix of C . The m\u03b2\u00d72n matrix of encoded files is given by Y = X \u00b7GC . Server s \u2208 [n] stores columns s and n+s of Y, i.e., it stores Y1,s and Y2,s (for an illustration see Figure 2). For a given integer c, which will be defined in the next paragraph, the parameter \u03b2 is fixed to \u03b2 = lcm(c, k)/k.\n2) Query and Star-Product Code: Let t be the collusion parameter with n2 \u2264 k+ t\u22121 < n. By Lemma 5.3 there exists an [n, t] GRS code D such that S = C D is an [n, k+t\u22121] weakly self-dual GRS code. We define the query code as the Cartesian product D = D \u00d7D . Thus, for a generator matrix GD of D , the matrix GD = diag (GD ,GD ) \u2208 F2t\u00d72nq is a generator matrix of D.\nDefine S = C D and S = C D . By (27) we have S = C D = S \u00d7S , so S is the Cartesian product of two star product codes. Define c = dS \u22121, where dS = n\u2212k\u2212t+2 is the minimum distance of S .\nLet HS \u2208 F(n\u2212k\u2212t+1)\u00d7nq be a parity-check matrix of S . By Definition 5.2, the code S has a generator matrix of the form GS = (H S F S )\nfor some FS \u2208 F[2(k+t\u22121)\u2212n]\u00d7nq . Hence, S has a generator matrix of form\nGS = diag (HS ,HS ) diag (FS ,FS ) \u2208 F2(k+t\u22121)\u00d72nq . (28)\nLemma 5.4: Let GS be the matrix defined in Eq. (28) and let HS be the submatrix of GS containing its first 2(n\u2212k\u2212t+ 1) rows. Let w1, . . . ,w2n be the column vectors of GS . Then, they satisfy conditions (a) and (b) of [23, Lemma 2], i.e.,\n2We choose this description of the storage code because this structure is required for the quantum PIR scheme. However, note that the system can equivalently be viewed as being encoded with an [n, k] code over Fq2 , where each of the servers stores one column of the resulting codeword matrix.\n(a) w\u03c0(1), . . . ,w\u03c0(k+t\u22121),w\u03c0(1)+n, . . . ,w\u03c0(k+t\u22121)+n are linearly independent for any permutation \u03c0 of [n].\n(b) HSJ G S = 0. Proof: It is well-known that any subset of k+t\u22121 columns\nof the generator matrix of an [n, k + t\u2212 1] MDS code are linearly independent. Hence, the columns w\u03c0(1), . . . ,w\u03c0(k+t\u22121) are linearly independent, as the first n columns of GS generate S. The same holds for w\u03c0(1)+n, . . . ,w\u03c0(k+t\u22121)+n. Trivially, any non-zero columns of a diagonal matrix are linearly independent and property (a) follows.\nProperty (b) follows directly from observing that, by definition, HSG S = 0 for any linear code with generator matrix GS and parity-check matrix HS .\nLet V be the space spanned by the first 2(n \u2212 k \u2212 t + 1) rows of GS , i.e., V = diag (HS ,HS ) row. By Lemma 5.4, the space V is self-orthogonal and the rows of GS span the space V\u22a5S . Notice that V is defined from a classical code E = HS row, which satisfies E \u2282 E\u22a5S . Thus, the stabilizer S(V) defines a Calderbank\u2013Steane\u2013Shor (CSS) code [38], [39], which is defined from the self-orthogonal space diag (GC1 ,GC2) row with the generator matrices GC1 and GC2 of two classical codes C1 and C2 satisfying C1 \u2282 C\u22a5S2 . Our QPIR scheme will be constructed with the CSS code.\n3) Targeted Positions: Let \u03c1 = lcm(c, k)/c. Fix J = {1, . . . ,max{c, k}} to be the set of server indices from which the user obtains the symbols of Y\u03b9. We consider J1 = [c] \u2286 J and we partition it into subsets J b1 = {i + (b \u2212 1)c/\u03b2|i \u2208 [c/\u03b2]}, b \u2208 [\u03b2]. Then, for r \u2208 [2 : \u03c1] we define recursively J br = {(j + c/\u03b2 \u2212 1) (mod |J |) + 1|j \u2208 J br\u22121} and Jr = b\u2208[\u03b2] J br . We will construct our scheme so that during the r-th iteration the user obtains the symbols (Y\u03b9,b1,a,Y \u03b9,b 2,a) for every a \u2208 J br and b \u2208 [\u03b2]. We define\nN(r) = (ena) a\u2208Jr \u2208 F c\u00d7n q , (29)\nwhere ena is the standard basis column vector of length n with a 1 in position a. Then, the matrix (G S (M\n(r)) ) , with M(r) = diag N(r),N(r)\n\u2208 F2c\u00d72nq , is a basis for F2nq .\nTo see that this is in fact a basis observe that the row span of N(r), by definition, contains vectors of weight at most c. The span of GS contains vectors of weight at least dS = c+ 1. It follows that the spans of N(r) and GS intersect trivially, which implies that their ranks add up.\n4) A Capacity-Achieving QPIR Scheme: In our scheme, we use the the stabilizer formalism for the transmission of the classical files. On the other hand, as discussed in Section II-D, the stabilizer formalism is often used for the transmission of quantum states, which is performed by four steps of the encoding of the state, transmission over the error channel, syndrome measurement, and error-correction. For the transmission of the classical files, similar to the QPIR scheme [23], we construct our scheme so that the desired file is extracted by the syndrome measurement of the stabilizer code. Then, by the same property as the superdense coding [40], our scheme can convey twice more classical information compared to the classical PIR schemes. We refer to [23, Sec. IV-B] for the detailed explanation of this idea.\nSuppose the desired file is X\u03b9. The queries are constructed so that the total response vector during one iteration is the sum of a codeword in S and a vector containing 2c distinct symbols of Y\u03b9 in known locations, and zeros elsewhere.\nWe now describe the five steps of the capacity-achieving QPIR scheme \u03a6 .\nProtocol 5.1: The first four steps are repeated in each round r \u2208 [\u03c1].\n1) Distribution of entangled state. Let H1, . . . ,Hn be qdimensional quantum systems, \u03c3init = qn\u22122(k+t\u22121) \u00b7 Iq2(k+t\u22121)\u2212n and F 2n q /V\u22a5S = {w = w + V\u22a5S:w \u2208\nM(r) row}. By Proposition 2.2.(b) the composite quantum system H = H1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 Hn is decomposed as H = W \u2297 Cq2(k+t\u22121)\u2212n , where W = span{|w |w \u2208 F\n2n q /V\u22a5S}. The state of H is initialized as |0 0| \u2297 \u03c3init and distributed such that server s \u2208 [n] obtains Hs. 2) Query. The user chooses a matrix Z(r) \u2208 Fm\u03b2\u00d72tq\nuniformly at random. We define E(\u03b9) \u2208 Fm\u03b2\u00d72cq with E(\u03b9),p,a = e m\u03b2 (\u03b9,a), p \u2208 [2], a \u2208 [c], where e m\u03b2 (\u03b9,a) is the standard basis column vector of length m\u03b2 with a 1 in coordinate (\u03b9, a). We denote by Q(r) \u2208 Fm\u03b2\u00d72nq the matrix of all the queries, which are computed as\nQ(r) = Z(r)E(\u03b9) \u00b7 GD M(r) =Z(r) \u00b7GD+E(\u03b9) \u00b7 M(r).\n(30)\nEach server s \u2208 [n] receives two vectors Q(r)1,s, Q(r)2,s \u2208 Fm\u03b2q . 3) Response. The servers compute the dot product of each column of their stored symbols and the respective column of the queries received, i.e., they compute the response B(r)p,s = Y p,s \u00b7 Q (r) p,s \u2208 Fq, s \u2208 [n], p \u2208 [2]. Server s\napplies X B(r)1,s and Z B(r)2,s to its quantum system\nand sends it to the user. 4) Measurement. The user applies the PVM BV =\n{Pw|w \u2208 F2nq /V\u22a5S} on H defined in Proposition 2.2 and obtains the output o(r) \u2208 F2cq . 5) Retrieval. Finally, after \u03c1 rounds the user has retrieved 2\u03c1c = 2\u03b2k symbols of Fq from which he can recover the desired file X\u03b9.\nC. Properties of the Coded QPIR Scheme\nLemma 5.5: The scheme \u03a6 of Section V-B is correct, i.e., fulfills Definition 3.1.\nProof: Let us fix the round r \u2208 [\u03c1] and let B(r) be the vector of responses computed by the servers. By Prop. 2.2.(c) the state after the servers\u2019 encoding is\nW(B(r))(|0 0| \u2297 \u03c3init)W(B(r))\u2020 = |B(r) B(r)| \u2297 \u03c3init. We observe that V\u22a5S = S since both spaces are spanned\nby the rows of GS . Notice that the row in coordinate (i, b) of the product E(\u03b9) \u00b7 M(r) is 2 p=1 a\u2208J br \u03b4i,\u03b9(e 2n (p,a))\n. Remembering that e2n(p,a) is the standard basis column vector of length 2n with a 1 in coordinate (p, a), by definition of the star product scheme the response vector is\nB(r) = B(r)1 B (r) 2 = m i=1 \u03b2 b=1 Yi,b Q(r),i,b\n= m i=1 \u03b2 b=1 Xi,b \u00b7GC\nZ(r),i,b \u00b7GD\n+ m i=1 \u03b2 b=1 Yi,b a\u2208J br \u03b4i,\u03b9 e2n(1,a) + e 2n (2,a)\n\u2208 S + \u03b2 b=1\na\u2208J br\nY\u03b9,b1,ae 2n (1,a) + Y \u03b9,b 2,ae 2n (2,a)\n= V\u22a5S + Y\u03b9,b1,a Y \u03b9,b 2,a\na\u2208J br ,b\u2208[\u03b2]\n\u00b7M(r). (31)\nThe random part is encoded into a vector in V\u22a5S while the vector\nY\u03b9,b1,a | Y \u03b9,b 2,a\na\u2208J br ,b\u2208[\u03b2]\n\u2208 F2cq is encoded with M(r)\nand hence independent of the representative of o(r). Therefore, the user obtains the latter without error after measuring the quantum systems with the PVM BV . Recall that we fixed \u03b2 = lcm(c, k)/k for c = dS \u2212 1. To allow the user to download exactly the desired file over \u03c1 iterations, we defined \u03c1 = lcm(c, k)/c. During each iteration, the user can download 2c/\u03b2 = 2k/\u03c1 symbols from each of the \u03b2 rows of Y\u03b9, where the factor 2 is achieved by utilizing the properties of superdense coding [40]. After \u03c1 rounds the user obtained the 2k symbols Y\u03b9,b \u2208 F2kq of each codeword corresponding to a block X\u03b9,b, b \u2208 [\u03b2] and is therefore able to recover the file.\nLemma 5.6: The scheme \u03a6 of Section V-B is symmetric and protects against t-collusion in the sense of Definition 3.2.\nProof: The idea is that user privacy is achieved since, for each subset of t servers, the corresponding joint distribution of queries is the uniform distribution over Fm\u03b2\u00d72tq . Consider a set of t colluding servers. The set of queries these servers\nreceive is given by Q(r) during round r \u2208 [\u03c1]. By the MDS property of the code D any subset of t columns of GD is linearly independent. As the columns of Z(r) are uniformly distributed and chosen independently for each r \u2208 [\u03c1], any subset of t columns of Z(r) \u00b7 GD is statistically independent and uniformly distributed. The sum of a uniformly distributed vector and an independently chosen vector is again uniformly distributed, and therefore adding the matrix E(\u03b9) \u00b7 M(r) does not incur any dependence between any subset of t columns and the file index \u03b9.\nFor each r \u2208 [\u03c1], server secrecy is achieved because in every round the received state of the user is |B(r) B(r)|\u2297\u03c3init with B(r) =\nY\u03b9,b1,a | Y \u03b9,b 2,a\na\u2208J br ,b\u2208[\u03b2]\nfrom (31) and this state is\nindependent of Yi with i = \u03b9. Unlike in the classical setting, the servers in the quantum\nsetting do not need access to a source of shared randomness that is hidden from the user to achieve server secrecy. However, this should not be viewed as an inherent advantage since the servers instead share entanglement.\nTheorem 5.1: The QPIR rate of the scheme in Section V-B is\nR(\u03a6 ) = 2(n \u2212 k \u2212 t + 1)\nn Proof: The user downloads \u03c1n quantum systems while\nretrieving 2k\u03b2 log(q) bits of information, thus the rate is given by\nR(\u03a6 ) = 2k\u03b2 log(q) log(q\u03c1n)\n= 2\u03c1c log(q) \u03c1n log(q) = 2(n \u2212 k \u2212 t + 1) n .\nThe presented scheme is an adapted version of the\nstar-product scheme of [12], which is strongly linear [10]. To see that the QPIR scheme is induced by this strongly linear scheme, it suffices to observe that for each p \u2208 [2] the second and third step in Protocol 5.1, up to the definition of the classical responses B(r)p,s with s \u2208 [n], are the same as in the star-product scheme. Hence, these steps can be viewed as two parallel instances of the star-product scheme and it follows directly from Definition 3.7 that this scheme is strongly linear."

            "text": "In this section, we prove Theorem 4.1 and Theorem 4.3.\nA. Proof of Theorem 4.1\nSince the upper bound 1 is trivial, we prove the quantum capacity in Theorem 4.1 is upper bounded by 2C [A]. Let \u03a6C be an arbitrary classical PIR scheme with assumptions A and error probability , and \u03a6Q[\u03a6C ] be an arbitrary dimension-squared QPIR scheme induced from \u03a6C with error probability . The PIR rate of \u03a6C is upper bounded as\nk\u03b2 log q n s=1H(Bs) \u2264 C [A]. (32)\nFrom the definition of dimension-squared QPIR, we have H(Bi) \u2264 2 log d for all s \u2208 [n] for \u03a6Q. Thus, the QPIR\nrate R(\u03a6Q) is upper bounded as\nR(\u03a6Q) = k\u03b2 log q n log d \u2264 2k\u03b2 log q n s=1H(Bs) \u2264 2C [A]. (33)\nThus, the desired QPIR capacity is upper bounded by 2C [A].\nB. Proof of Theorem 4.3\nTheorem 4.3 is proved with the following idea. If the answered state from some k servers is independent of the targeted file X\u03b9, the user and the remaining (n\u2212k) servers can use the answers from the k servers as entanglement shared with the user. Then, the entanglement-assisted classical-quantum channel capacity [26] implies that the user can obtain at most 2(n \u2212 k) log d bits of X\u03b9, which implies Theorem 4.3. Thus, we show that the answered state of the servers 1, . . . , k have no information of X\u03b9. For the proof, we consider the process in which the k servers apply quantum operations sequentially, and evaluate the information of X\u03b9 contained in the quantum systems. Initially, the k servers have quantum systems H1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 Hk and the state is independent of X\u03b9. After server 1\u2019s operation, the state on A1 \u2297 H2 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 Hk has at most (log d)/m bits of X\u03b9 from the user secrecy. Furthermore, we prove that as one more server applies the operation, at most (log d)/m bits of X\u03b9 is added to the state of the k servers, from the MDS-coded storage structure and the user secrecy. Consequently, after all servers\u2019 operations, the k servers\u2019 quantum systems contain at most (k log d)/m bits of X\u03b9, which converges 0 as m \u2192 \u221e.\nThroughout the proofs, we use superscripts c (resp. u, s, m) over equalities and inequalities for denoting they are derived from correctness (resp. user secrecy, server secrecy, MDS coded storage structure) of the QPIR scheme. For example, u= denotes that the equality is derived from the user secrecy of QPIR scheme.\nThe following proofs are written with quantum mutual information and quantum relative entropy defined as follows. When a quantum system A has a state \u03c3 =\ni pi|\u03c8i \u03c8i|, the\nvon Neumann entropy is defined as H(A)\u03c3 = Tr(\u03c3 log \u03c3) = \u2212\ni pi log pi. Similar to the classical case, the mutual information and conditional mutual information are defined as I(A;B)\u03c3 = H(A)\u03c3 +H(B)\u03c3 \u2212H(AB)\u03c3 and I(A;B|C)\u03c3 = I(A;BC)\u03c3 \u2212 I(A; C)\u03c3 , respectively. For two states \u03c3 and \u03c3 on A, the quantum relative entropy is defined as D(\u03c3 \u03c3 ) = Tr(\u03c3(log \u03c3 \u2212 log \u03c3 )). Similar to classical case, we have I(A;B)\u03c3 = D(\u03c3 \u03c3A \u2297 \u03c3B)\nFor the proof, we prepare two propositions. Proposition 6.1 (Fano\u2019s Inequality): Let X,Y be random\nvariables with values in [n] and Z be any random variable. Then, H(X |Y Z) \u2264 logn+ h2( ), where \u03b5 = Pr[X = Y ].\nProposition 6.2: Let \u03ba be a CPTP map from A to B and \u03c3 be a state on A\u2297C. Then, I(A; C)\u03c3 \u2265 I(B; C)\u03ba\u2297idC(\u03c3), where idC is the identity operator on C.\nProof: The proposition follows from the following inequality\nI(A; C)\u03c3 = D(\u03c3 \u03c3A \u2297 \u03c3C) \u2265 D(\u03ba\u2297 idC(\u03c3) \u03ba(\u03c3A) \u2297 \u03c3C) = I(B; C)\u03ba\u2297idC(\u03c3),\nwhere \u03c3A and \u03c3C are reduced states on A and C, and the inequality is from the data-processing inequality of the quantum relative entropy.\nTheorem 4.3 is proved by the following two lemmas. Lemma 6.1: The size of one file is upper bounded as\nk\u03b2 log q \u2264 2(n \u2212 k) log d + I(A[k];X\u03b9|Q\u03b9) + h2( )\n1 \u2212 , (34)\nwhere = max\u03b9\u2208[m] Pr[X\u03b9 = X\u0303\u03b9]. Proof: Fix the index of the targeted file as K = \u03b9 = argmax\u03b9\u2208[m] Pr[X \u03b9 = X\u0303\u03b9]. The uniformity of X\u03b9 \u2208 F\u03b2\u00d7kq and the Fano\u2019s inequality (Proposition 6.1) imply\nI(X\u0302\u03b9;X\u03b9|Q\u03b9) = H(X\u03b9|Q\u03b9) \u2212H(X\u03b9|X\u0302\u03b9Q\u03b9) (35) \u2265 (1 \u2212 )k\u03b2 log q \u2212 h2( ). (36)\nFrom Proposition 6.2, the mutual information in the above inequality is upper bounded as\nI(A;X\u03b9|Q\u03b9) \u2265 I(X\u0302\u03b9;X\u03b9|Q\u03b9). (37) Furthermore, the left-hand side of the above inequality is upper bounded as\nI(A;X\u03b9|Q\u03b9) = I(A[k+1:n];X\u03b9|A[k]Q\u03b9) + I(A[k];X\u03b9|Q\u03b9) \u2264 2 log dimA[k+1:n] + I(A[k];X\u03b9|Q\u03b9) = 2(n \u2212 k) log d + I(A[k];X\u03b9|Q\u03b9).\nThus, combining (36), (37), and (38), we obtain the desired lemma.\nLemma 6.2: limm\u2192\u221e I(A[k];X\u03b9|Q\u03b9) = 0. With Lemmas 6.1 and 6.2, we prove Theorem 4.3 as\nfollows. From Lemma 6.1, the [n, k, 1]-QPIR capacity is upper bounded as\nC [n,k,1]m, = sup k\u03b2 log q n log d\n(38)\n\u2264 1 1 \u2212\n2(n \u2212 k) n + I(A[k];X\u03b9|Q\u03b9) + h2( ) n log d . (39)\nFurthermore, Lemma 6.2 proves that I(A[k];X\u03b9|Q\u03b9) approaches zero as the number of files m goes to infinity, and h2( ) \u2192 0 as \u2192 0. Thus, as m \u2192 \u221e and \u2192 0, the capacity is upper bounded by 2(1 \u2212 k/n), which implies Theorem 4.3.\nIn the remainder of this subsection, we prove Lemma 6.2. For the proof, we prepare the following lemma.\nLemma 6.3: Suppose that t \u2208 [n] and T \u2282 [n] satisfy t \u2208 T . Then,\nI(AtHT ;Y \u03b9t |Q\u03b9) \u2264 2 log d\nm . (40)\nProof: Since the operation from Ht to At is applied on the quantum system of dimension of d, we have\nI(AtHT ;Yt|Q\u03b9) \u2264 2 log d. (41) On the other hand, we have\nI(AtHT ;Yt|Q\u03b9) = m j=1 I(AtHT ;Y jt |Y [j\u22121] t Q \u03b9) (42) = m j=1 I(AtHT Y [j\u22121]t ;Y j t |Q\u03b9) \u2265 m j=1 I(AtHT ;Y jt |Q\u03b9) (43) u= mI(AtHT ;Y \u03b9t |Q\u03b9), (44)\nwhere the last equality follows from the user secrecy condition. Thus, combining (41) and (44), we obtain the desired inequality (40).\nNow, we prove Lemma 6.2. Proof: [Proof of Lemma 6.2] By mathematical induction, we prove\nlim m\u2192\u221e I(A[j]H[j+1:k];Y \u03b9[j]|Q\u03b9) = 0 (45)\nfor any j \u2208 [k]. Then, the case for j = k proves the lemma. First, the case j = 1 follows from Lemma 6.3. Next,\nassuming\nlim m\u2192\u221e I(A[j]H[j+1:k];Y \u03b9[j]|Q\u03b9) = 0, (46)\nwe prove\nlim m\u2192\u221e I(A[j+1]H[j+2:k];Y \u03b9[j+1]|Q\u03b9) = 0 (47)\nfor j \u2208 [k \u2212 1]. Since\nI(A[j+1]H[j+2:k];Y \u03b9[j+1]|Q\u03b9) (48) = I(A[j+1]H[j+2:k];Y \u03b9[j]|Q\u03b9)\n+I(A[j+1]H[j+2:k];Y \u03b9j+1|Y \u03b9[j]Q\u03b9), (49)\nwe prove that the two terms of (49) approaches 0 as m \u2192 \u221e. Then, we obtain the desired statement by induction.\nThe first term of (49) is upper bounded as\nI(A[j+1]H[j+2:k];Y \u03b9[j]|Q\u03b9) \u2264 I(A[j+1]H[j+2:k]Yj+1;Y \u03b9[j]|Q\u03b9) (a)\n\u2264 I(A[j]H[j+1:k]Yj+1;Y \u03b9[j]|Q\u03b9) m= I(A[j]H[j+1:k];Y \u03b9[j]|Q\u03b9),\nwhere (a) follows from Proposition 6.2 and the last equality holds because Yj+1 is independent of all other quantum systems and random variables. Thus, by the assumption (46), the first term of (49) approaches 0 as m \u2192 \u221e.\nThe second term of (49) is upper bounded as\nI(A[j+1]H[j+2:k];Y \u03b9j+1|Y \u03b9[j]Q\u03b9) (50) m= I(A[j+1]H[j+2:k]Y \u03b9[j];Y \u03b9j+1|Q\u03b9) (51) \u2264 I(A[j+1]H[j+2:k]Y[j];Y \u03b9j+1|Q\u03b9) (52) \u2264 I(Aj+1H[k]\\{j+1}Y[j];Y \u03b9j+1|Q\u03b9) (53) m= I(Aj+1H[k]\\{j+1};Y \u03b9j+1|Q\u03b9) \u2264\nlog d m , (54)\nwhere (53) follows from Proposition 6.2 and the last inequality is from Lemma 6.3. Thus, the second term of (49) approaches 0 as m \u2192 \u221e."

            "text": "In this paper, we have studied the capacity of QPIR/QSPIR with [n, k]-MDS coded storage and t colluding servers. As general classes of QPIR, we defined stabilizer QPIR and dimension-squared QPIR induced from classical strongly linear PIR. We have proved that the capacities of stabilizer QPIR/QSPIR and dimension-squared QPIR/QSPIR induced from strongly linear PIR are 2(n \u2212 k \u2212 t + 1)/n. When there is no collusion, i.e., t = 1, we have proved that the asymptotic capacity of QPIR/QSPIR is 2(n \u2212 k)/n, when the number of files m approaches infinity. These capacities are greater than the known classical counterparts. For the achievability, we have proposed a capacity-achieving QSPIR scheme. The proposed scheme combined the star product PIR\nscheme [12] and the QPIR scheme with the stabilizer formalism [23].\nAs open problems, we state three directions for extending our results. The first direction is to find the general capacity of QPIR/QSPIR with MDS coded storage and colluding servers. This problem in full generality is also unsolved in the classical setting. Partial solutions were given in [8] and [9], which imply that the combination of collusion and coded storage leads to involved linear dependencies that need to be taken into account for a general converse proof. Note that as the capacities proved in these works depend on the number of files m, it is possible that they exceed the asymptotic QPIR capacity proved in this work for a very small number of files.\nThe second direction is to find non-stabilizer QPIR schemes. Most of the existing multi-server QPIR schemes are stabilizer QPIR schemes. Finding non-stabilizer QPIR schemes is the first step towards the achievability part of the general non-asymptotic capacity theorem.\nThe third direction is to clarify the trade-off between the amount of entanglement and the capacity. However, even in the case of only two servers, it is very challenging to derive the capacity with restricted entanglement. As a related study, the entanglement-assisted classical capacity for a noisy quantum channel [41] has been recently studied with several new techniques."
