    "abstractText": "Reactivation of p53 tumor-suppressor function by small molecules is an attractive strategy to defeat cancer. A potent p53-reactivating molecule RITA, which triggers p53-dependent apoptosis in human tumor cells in vitro and in vivo, exhibits p53-independent cytotoxicity due to modifications by detoxification enzyme Sulfotransferase 1A1 (SULT1A1), producing a reactive carbocation. Several synthetic modifications to RITA\u2019s heterocyclic scaffold lead to higher energy barriers for carbocation formation. In this study, we addressed the question whether RITA analogs NSC777196 and NSC782846 can induce p53dependent apoptosis without SULT1A1-dependent DNA damage. We found that RITA analog NSC782846, but not NSC777196, induced p53-regulated genes, targeted oncogene addiction, and killed cancer cells upon p53 reactivation, but without induction of DNA damage and inhibition RNA pol II. Our results might demonstrate a method for designing more specific and potent RITA analogs to accelerate translation of p53-targeting compounds from laboratory bench to clinic.",

A potent p53-reactivating molecule RITA, which triggers p53-dependent apoptosis in human tumor cells in vitro and in vivo, exhibits p53-independent cytotoxicity due to modifications by detoxification enzyme Sulfotransferase 1A1 (SULT1A1), producing a reactive carbocation. Several synthetic modifications to RITA\u2019s heterocyclic scaffold lead to higher energy barriers for carbocation formation. In this study, we addressed the question whether RITA analogs NSC777196 and NSC782846 can induce p53dependent apoptosis without SULT1A1-dependent DNA damage. We found that RITA analog NSC782846, but not NSC777196, induced p53-regulated genes, targeted oncogene addiction, and killed cancer cells upon p53 reactivation, but without induction of DNA damage and inhibition RNA pol II. Our results might demonstrate a method for designing more specific and potent RITA analogs to accelerate translation of p53-targeting compounds from laboratory bench to clinic."

            "text": "The tumor-suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that binds to the promoters of its target genes and regulates their expression. Upon DNA damage and other types of stresses, p53 blocks proliferation of pre-malignant and malignant cells or eliminates them by inducing apoptosis (1\u20133). p53 inactivation via mutations or enhanced degradation by MDM2 is the most frequent alteration in human cancers, which underscores the key role of p53 in combating cancer (4\u20136). Reinstatement of p53 by genetic means has demonstrated remarkable tumor suppression in animal models, including inhibition of aggressive metastatic lesions (7\u201310). This inspires the idea of developing small molecules reactivating p53 to fight cancer.\nWe have identified a small-molecule RITA (reactivation of p53 and induction of tumor cell apoptosis), which prevents p53/MDM2 interaction, induces p53 accumulation and transcriptional activity, and triggers p53-dependent apoptosis in tumor cells of a different origin in vitro and in mice (11\u201313). However, at levels similar to efficacious doses observed in mouse xenografts of human cancer cell lines, RITA caused pulmonary edema in rat, dog, and monkey (14), but not in mice, which are deficient for the expression of phenol sulfotransferase detoxification enzymes in lung (15). We found that p53-independent cytotoxicity of RITA requires modification by SULT1A1 (16). Hence, further development of this chemotype necessitates the generation of\nanalogs for which SULT1A1 expression is not sufficient for p53independent activity.\nWith the development of precisionmedicine that specifically targets cancer drivers, such as imatinib (Gleevec) and others, these types of therapeutics can be used in the clinic with fewer adverse side effects (17\u201319). The concept of selectively targeting specific types of cancer cells, rather thangeneratingbroadly cytotoxic compounds, is now widely viewed as a desirable route for drugdevelopment.With respect to RITA,wehypothesize that broad toxicity observed inmultiplemammals was due to nonspecific biological activities of the SULT1A1-modified molecule, such as induction of DNA damage and inhibition of transcriptionprocesses (RNApolymerase II stalling anddegradation; ref. 20). More target-selective analogs, recently designed by Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) at National Cancer Institute (NCI), in collaboration with Peyser and colleagues, narrowed the cytotoxicity profile of RITA without elimination of in vivo antitumor activity.\nIn this study, we applied multidimensional approaches, including analysis of gene expression profiles, analysis of NCI pharmacology database and functional assays, to identify the mechanisms of action (MoA) of RITA analogs NSC777196 and NSC782846. These findings might indicate how to design novel highly selective p53-targeting compounds."

            "text": "The antitumor activity of RITA analogs shows decreased SULT1A1 dependence\nWe investigated how a series of synthetic modifications to RITA heterocyclic scaffold in NSC777196 and NSC782846 (Fig. 1A) affect their SULT1A1 dependence. Analysis of the NCI-60 pharmacological database revealed a decreased correlation between the baseline expression level of SULT1A1 and cell growth inhibition by RITA analogs compared with RITA (R2 \u00bc 0.62 for RITA; R2 \u00bc 0.45 for NSC777196; R2 \u00bc 0.43 for NSC782846; Fig. 1B).\nNext, we validated the decreased SULT1A1 dependence of anticancer activities by RITA analogs. We assessed the effects of NSC777196 and NSC782846 in seven cancer cell lines with different SULT1A1 levels (Fig. 1C, top). We performed proliferation assay in cell lineswith low SULT1A1:wtp53 osteosarcoma SJSA,mutp53 breast carcinoma MDA-MB231, wtp53 melanoma A375, p53-null lung adenocarcinoma H1299; and with high SULT1A1: mutp53 breast carcinoma T47D, mutp53 epidermoid carcinoma A431, and wtp53 osteosarcoma U2OS.The level of SULT1A protein is shown in the top in Fig. 1C and the growth suppression byNSC782846 andNSC777196 is shown in the bottom in Fig. 1C. As evident from Fig. 1C, the response to NSC782846 was much less dependent on SULT1A1 than that of NSC777196.\nTo further validate the decreased SULT1A1 dependence of growth suppression by RITA analogs, we performed CRISPR\u2013Cas9-mediated deletion of SULT1A1 alleles in MCF7 and HCT116 cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Although RITA and NSC777196 inhibited cell proliferation in a SULT1A1-dependent manner, NSC777196 was more efficient in the MCF7 SULT1A1 knock out (KO) cell line than RITA. The viability of MCF7 SULT1A1KO cells reached 73% by NSC777196 compared with 82% by RITA, whereas the same dose leads to wild-type (WT) cell line reduction to 49% (Fig. 1D, left and middle). The growth suppression by NSC782846 was similar in the MCF7 SULT1A1KO and WT cell lines when the concentration was higher than 10 mmol/L (Fig. 1D, right), suggesting a decreased dependence of growth suppression on SULT1A1. In the HCT116 cell line, all three compounds demonstrated dependence on SULT1A1 expression, albeit to a different extent. HCT116 SULT1A1\u2013/\u2013 was resistant to RITA and NSC777196 at the GI50 dose in the HCT116 WT cell line, whereas NSC782846 resulted in 8% cell death (Supplementary Fig. S1B).\nIn addition to the engineered SULT1A1 deletion by CRISPR\u2013Cas9 in HCT116 and MCF7 cell models, we tested the dependence on SULT1A using two additional cell models. We engineered SULT1A1 status in wtp53 osteosarcoma SJSA and melanoma A375 with low SULT1A1, in which we overexpressed SULT1A1 using lentivirus (Supplementary Fig. S1C). As shown in the top in Supplementary Fig. S1D, overexpression of SULT1A1 in SJSA cells did not change the response to NSC782846, whereas it sensitized to RITA and NSC777196. In A375 cells overexpression of SULT1A1 significantly increased sensitivity to RITA and NSC777196, whereas the effect on response to NSC782846 was much less pronounced (Supplementary Fig. S1D, bottom).\nOverall, these data show that the decreased SULT1A1 dependence of the growth suppression by RITA analogs, NSC782846 in particular.\nTranscriptional repression of oncogenes and growth suppression of RITA analogs are p53-dependent\nWe confirmed the induction of the p53 protein levels by RITA analogs using immunofluorescence staining (Supplementary Fig. S2A).\nTo explore the effects of restoring p53 function in tumor cells by NSC777196 and NSC782846, we analyzed the changes in gene expression in isogenic MCF7 WT and MCF7 p53KO cells after treatment by using qPCR. We observed a marked downregulation of representative oncogenes: IGF1R,MYC (c-Myc) andMCL1 (Fig. 2A), in line with our previous data obtained upon treatment with RITA (13). Transcriptional repression of oncogenes was p53-dependent, as we observed much less or no changes in the expression of these genes in the p53KO counterpart cell line by NSC777196 and NSC782846, respectively (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the mRNA level, the protein level of oncogenes was significantly decreased after treatment. Inhibition of oncogenes was partly or totally rescued in the p53KO cell line upon NSC777196 and NSC782846 treatment, respectively (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. S2B), corroborating p53 dependence. We further confirmed this result in another cell line, HCT116 (Supplementary Fig. S2C).\nBecause the effects of NSC782846 on oncogene inhibition were totally p53-dependent, we tested whether inhibition of cell proliferationwas also p53-dependent. Indeed, using short-term and long-term assays, we found a significant contribution of p53 to cancer cell growth, suppression uponNSC782846 (Fig. 2C; for 48 and 72 hours time point see Supplementary Fig. S2D). We found that the role of p53 in growth suppression by NSC777196 was quite weak, although detectable (Supplementary Fig. S2D). We confirmed this result in another two cell lines, A375 and SJSA (Supplementary Fig. S2E\u2013S2G). Our results obtained in short-term and long-term growth suppression assays shown in Supplementary Fig. S2F and S2G corroborated the p53dependent effect of NSC782846 in A375 and SJSA cell lines, because p53KObyCRISPR\u2013Cas9 significantly prevented growth inhibition. In addition, the effect of treatment with NSC782846 was irreversible, because it was evident upon washing out the compound after 48 hours of treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2G).\nIn summary, our results show that NSC782846 treatment leads to downregulation of oncogenes expression in a p53-dependent manner. p53 contribution to growth suppression by NSC782846 is significant, whereas the role of p53 in the effects of NSC777196 is less substantial.\nDose-dependent repression of oncogenes by RITA analogs Our results suggest that pharmacologically reactivated p53 acts as a potent repressor of a number of oncogenic and survival factors, as well as functions as a powerful trigger of p53 targets, pro-apoptotic NOXA and cdk inhibitor p21 (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, we found that the transactivation of p53 target genes requires a lower dose ofNSC777196 than transrepression of pro-survival genes. As evident from Fig. 3A, left, in response to 0.5 mmol/L NSC777196 p53 and its targets NOXA and p21 were induced. In contrast, oncogenes were regulated differently, whereas 5 mmol/L NSC777196 was sufficient to trigger a sharp downregulation of c-Myc, MCL1, MDM2, and Bcl-2, upon treatment with 0.5 mmol/L NSC777196 the decline of these oncogenes was less pronounced.\nAs for NSC782846, time but not dose plays an important role in downregulation of the oncogenic proteins (Fig. 3A, right). Upon either 5 or 10 mmol/L NSC782846 treatment for 12 hours the repression of c-Myc, MCL1, and IGF1-R was quite weak. Prolonged to 24 hours treatment produced a significant downregulation of oncogenes mentioned above. RITA as a positive control was much more efficient in oncogenes inhibition. p21 mRNA was induced, but its protein level was downregulated by RITA, as we have shown previously (25). In contrast, NSC782846 induced p21 both on mRNA and protein level that suggests a different MoA compared with RITA.\nqPCR confirmed the transcriptional repression of IGF1R, MCL1, MYC, and BCL-2 and transcriptional activation of p53-target genes\nMol Cancer Ther; 21(10) October 2022 MOLECULAR CANCER THERAPEUTICS1526\nD ow nloaded from http://aacrjournals.org/m ct/article-pdf/21/10/1524/3211460/1524.pdf by guest on 25 January 2024\nCDKN1A (encoding p21), BBC3 (PUMA) and PMAIP1 (NOXA) by both RITA analogs (Fig. 3B).\nWe used PI and Annexin-V double staining to detect apoptotic cells upon RITA analogs 16 hours post-treatment. As shown in Fig. 3C, both analogs can induce efficient apoptosis, but the fraction of apoptotic cells upon NSC782846 treatment was lower than upon NSC777196 treatment.\nTaken together, our data imply that repression of oncogenes by NSC782846 occurs through a different mechanism compared with RITA and its analog NSC777196.\nRITA analogs can induce p53 activation, p53-dependent induction of proapoptotic genes, repression of oncogenes and cancer cell apoptosis in SULT1A1-independent manner\nPrevious data have shown that RITA is modified by enzyme SULT1A1 and that its cancer cell cytotoxicity can be rescued by phenol sulfotransferase inhibition (14). To explore whether RITA analogs can inhibit cancer cell proliferation in the absence of SULT1A1, we analyzed their effects in theMCF7 SULT1A1\u2013/\u2013 cell line.\nWe found that in the absence of SULT1A1 both compounds induced p53 accumulation, demonstrating that p53 activation is independent of SULT1A1. Along with p53 induction, treatment with RITA analogs lead to downregulation of several crucial oncogenes, IGF1-R, c-Myc, andMCL1, both on mRNA and protein level (Fig. 4A and B), similar to the downregulation of oncogenes we detected in SULT1A1-expressing cells (Fig. 2A and B). Besides oncogene repression, we detected the induction of p53 target genes in SULT1A1deficient cells: proapoptotic PMAIP1 and BBC3, and cell-cycle arrest gene CDKN1A, although the kinetics of induction of these genes differed (Supplementary Fig. S3A).\nTo further validate the p53-dependent and SULT1A1-independent inhibition of oncogenes, we depleted p53 by shRNA in MCF7 SULT1A1\u2013/\u2013 cell line. Our results presented in Fig. 4C show that the downregulation of oncogenes was rescued after p53 knockdown in SULT1A1-depleted cells.\nNotably, the greater oncogene downregulation upon 16 hours treatment with 10 mmol/L NSC782846 resulted in greater cell death compared with 10 mmol/L NSC777196 at the same time point\nRITA\nHO HO HOOH OH OH S S S\nS O\nO O OO\nA\nC\nD\nB\nNSC777196 NSC782846\nRITA\n8\n7\n\u2212L og\n10 G\nI 5 0\nLog2 SULT1A1 mRNA expression\n6\n5\n7\n6\n5\n4\n7\n6\n5\n4 5 6 7 8\nSJ SA A3 75 MD A-M\nB2 31 H1 29 9 U2 OS A4 31 T4 7D\n9 10 5 6 7 8 9 10 5 6 7 8 9 10\nR2 = 0.62 R2 = 0.45 R2 = 0.43\nLow"

Bottom, NSC777196 efficiently suppressed the growth of high SULT1A1-expressing cells (U2OS, T47D, and A431, red lines) while having negligible effect in cells with lowSULT1A1 (A375,MDAMB-231, SJSA,H1299,black lines).

At extended treatment times, both RITA analogs led to apoptosis in the SULT1A1\u2013/\u2013 cells, as detected by PARP cleavage (Supplementary Fig. S3B).\nNSC782846 can induce p53 accumulation in the absence of DNA damage or transcriptional inhibition\nWe have previously shown that RITA treatment triggers well established p53 stimuli, DNA damage and transcriptional block via inhibition of RNA pol II (20). To find out whether RITA analogs can induce p53 in the absence of transcriptional inhibition and DNA damage, we used the MCF7 SULT1A1\u2013/\u2013 cell line to perform the next series of experiments. In this cell line, RITA analogs are not modified by SULT1A1 to generate reactive carbocations, although we cannot rule out the possibility that other sulfotransferases can modify them. Notably, we found that in the absence of SULT1A1, NSC782846 did not induce the hallmark of DNA damage gH2AX (Fig. 5A and B; the densitometric quantification of the bands in Fig. 5A is shown in Supplementary Fig. S4A). However, p53 was strongly induced by NSC782846, suggesting a DNA damage-independent mechanism. On the other hand, NSC777196 leads to p53 accumulation along with induction of gH2AX, albeit weaker compared with RITA (Fig. 5A and B). These data suggest that although RITA and NSC777196 could be modified by sulfotransferases other than SULT1A1 (for example, SULT1A2 or SULT1E1), NSC782846 is less amenable to sulfonation.\nTo investigate the effect of RITA analogs on transcriptional block, we visualized active transcription by following incorporation of EU\ninto nascent RNA in MCF7 SULT1A1\u2013/\u2013 cells. As shown in Fig. 5C, positive control RITA abolished RNA synthesis, similar to the known RNA Pol II inhibitor ActD. However, RITA analogs NSC777196 and NSC782846 did not block RNA synthesis. In line with these results, we found that the levels of total and phospho-S2 (elongating form) RNA Pol II were strongly decreased upon RITA treatment, but not upon treatment with RITA analogs (Fig. 5D). Further evidence for the crucial role of SUTL1A1-meditedmodification of RITAand its analogs in the inhibition of transcription comes from the results obtained upon overexpression of SULT1A1 in SJSA cells with low SULT1A1 levels. Overexpression of SULT1A1 resulted in the decrease of RNA pol II expression and less RNA synthesis upon RITA and its analogs treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4B and S4C). Interestingly, upon overexpression of SULT1A1 NSC782846 and NSC777196 induced less gH2AX compared with RITA (Supplementary Fig. S4B).\nWe also performed experiments on dose dependence of effects of RITA analogs in the WT cell line to further elucidate their MoA. Our data show that even a very low dose\u20140.25 mmol/L NSC777196 and 1 mmol/L NSC782846\u2014can significantly downregulate oncogenes upon p53 activation (Fig. 5E). Notably, 1 mmol/L NSC782846 is sufficient to inhibit cell proliferation (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 5F and Supplementary Fig. S4D, 1 mmol/L NSC782846 did not inhibit RNA Pol II nor block RNA synthesis, which indicate that the inhibition of oncogenes and growth suppression upon 1 mmol/L NSC782846 are indeed regulated by reactivated p53 but not due to global inhibition of transcription. In line with our results shown above, effects of NSC777196 on DNA damage and transcriptional block were\nMol Cancer Ther; 21(10) October 2022 MOLECULAR CANCER THERAPEUTICS1528\nD ow nloaded from http://aacrjournals.org/m ct/article-pdf/21/10/1524/3211460/1524.pdf by guest on 25 January 2024\nweaker than that of RITA, but stronger than those induced by NSC782846 (Fig. 5).\nThus, we conclude that NSC777196 and NSC782846 are much less capable of induction ofDNAdamage and block of transcription, in line with previous study (14) showing that RITA analogs, especially NSC782846, have higher transition state barriers for the spontaneous formation of a reactive carbocation.\nCombination of low-dose NSC782846 with 4-OH tamoxifen shows a synergetic effect in ER-positive breast cancer\nOn the basis of the tight relationship of the effect of our compounds and p53 as well as its negative regulators, MDM2 andMDM4, we used cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics to analyze the frequency of MDM2, MDM4, and TP53 gene alterations (Study of Origin; refs. 26, 27). MDM2 andMDM4 gene amplification frequency in breast cancer are 4% and 15%, respectively (Fig. 6A). As shown inTable 1, bothMDM2/ MDM4 amplifications and TP53 mutations have the tendency to be mutually exclusive.\nWe analyzed the relationship between the ER status of the primary breast cancer andMDM2/MDM4 amplification. Excluding 27 patients\nwith unknown ER status, we found that in ER-positive patientsMDM2 is amplified significantly more frequently (Fig. 6B). Although there was no statistical difference in MDM4 gene alterations between ERpositive and -negative patients (0.05 < P < 0.1), it might become more clear upon analysis of a larger patient cohort.\nOur analysis suggests that ER-positive patients might benefit from compounds depleting MDM2/4. Low doses of compounds NSC782846 can activateWTp53 (Fig. 5E) and inhibitMDM2/MDM4 (Fig. 6C), similar to downregulation of MDM2 and MDM4 by RITA, as we previously published (28). In addition, the activity of RITA in NCI-60 cell lines is weakly associated with mRNA expression of p53 binding partnerMDM2 (R2\u00bc 0.22). However, the growth suppression byNSC777196 andNSC782846 ismuchmore strongly associatedwith baselineMDM2 expression (R2\u00bc 0.38 and 0.47, respectively; Fig. 6D), suggesting that interference with p53/MDM2 binding may be more important for NSC782846 activity.\nThus, we tested whether combination of 4-OH tamoxifen (4-OH TMX) with NSC782846 has an additive or synergistic effect on ER-positive breast cancer. Indeed, we observed much stronger growth suppression upon the 2 days pretreatment with 4OH-TMX combined\nIGF1R MCL1 BCL-2 CDKN1A BBC3 PMAIP1MYCMDM2\nMDM2\nIGF1-R\nc-Myc\nMCL1\nBcl-2\np21\np53p53 DM\nSO 12 h 24 h 12 h 24 h DM SO RIT A 24 h 12 h 12 h 24 h\nc-Myc\nMCL1\n\u03b2-Actin\n\u03b2-Actin\n\u03b2-Actin\n\u03b2-Actin\nPrecursor\nIGF1-R\nBcI-2\n\u2217\u2217\u2217 \u2217\u2217\u2217\n\u2217\u2217\u2217\n\u2217\u2217\u2217\n\u2217\u2217\u2217 \u2217\u2217\u2217\n\u2217\u2217\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217\n\u2217\u2217 \u2217\u2217\n\u2217\u2217 \u2217\u2217 \u2217\u2217\n\u2217\u2217\np21\nNOXA\nNOXA\nNSC782846\nNSC782846\nNSC777196\nNSC777196\nNSC782846\nDMSO NSC777196\n0.5 \u03bcmol/L 5 \u03bcmol/L 5 \u03bcmol/L 10 \u03bcmol/L\n2\n1\nPI\nAnnexin-V\n0\nQ1 2.42\nQ2 0.14\nQ2 0.49 Q1 1.22 Q1 2.22\nQ2 0.54\nQ4 96.4\n102 102\n103\n104\n105\n103 104 105 102 103 104 105 102 103 104 105\nQ3 1.07\nQ3 13.9 Q4 84.4 Q4 86.8\nQ3 10.4\n\u22121\n\u22122\nqR T-\nP C R Lo g 1 0 fo ld\nc ha\nng e\n20\n15\n10\n5 0A po\npt ot\nic c\nel ls\n( %\n)C\nA\nB\nFigure 3.

As shown in Fig. 6F, appropriate doses of 4OH-TMX slightly inhibited the viability of ER-positive breast cancer cells. However, a combination of NSC782846 and 4-OH TMX resulted in a much stronger antiproliferative effect compared with those of individual agents. NSC782846 had a synergistic effect with 4-OH TMX (CI < 1) when used in combination in MCF7 breast cancer cells.\nIn conclusion, p53-activating compounds with mechanism similar to NSC782846 might be good candidates for a personalized therapy of ER-positive patients with breast cancer in combination with 4-OH TMX\u2013mediated endocrine therapy."

            "text": "Small-molecule RITA has been previously identified by us using a phenotypic screen of the NCI compounds library. RITA displayed efficient induction of apoptosis by inhibiting MDM2 and MDM4 in cancer cells as well as in mouse xenografts (25, 28, 29). The exact mechanism of RITA action remains to be elucidated; in addition to p53-dependent growth suppression, it has strong p53-independent\neffects in cancer cells (16, 20, 30). Recently we have further elucidated the details of RITA interaction with p53 and revealed that RITA prevents the interaction between p53 andMDM2/MDM4via allosteric mechanism (31).\np53-independent cytotoxic effects of RITA are dependent on phenol sulfotransferase SULT1A1, indicating that RITA is most likely a prodrug activated by sulfonation, with a mechanism dependent on the carbocation generation (32). The observed high toxicity of RITA in lungs of rats, dogs, and monkeys relative to mice (14) could be explained by the complete lack of phenol sulfotransferase activity in mouse lung cytosol (15). Thus, lung toxicity of RITA is the most important problem to be addressed. Our results showed that RITA analog NSC782846 can induce cancer cell apoptosis in the absence of SULT1A1. However, even if there was no DNA damage in the absence of SULT1A1 by NSC782846, another analog, NSC777196, still able to induce DNA damage and partially inhibit RNA pol II. Thus, the possibility remains that other sulfotransferases (such as SULT1A2, which is co-expressed with SULT1A1) could be responsible for activation of the NSC777196, whereas NSC782846 is much less prone to sulfonation.

More specifically, lung toxicity detection with these RITA analogs in rats or other mammals needs to be explored in the future. Another p53-independent effect of RITA is that it can inhibit RNA Pol I- and Pol II\u2013mediated transcription by ROS-mediated DNA damage (20), thereby broadly repress transcription, including oncogene expression. In our study, we found that a low dose of NSC782846\nMol Cancer Ther; 21(10) October 2022 MOLECULAR CANCER THERAPEUTICS1532\nactivates p53, its target genes and represses oncogenes without inhibiting the transcription process and in the absence of DNA damage. Taken together, our data provide compelling evidence that RITA analog NSC782846 is indeed specifically targeting p53 in cancer cells. We also speculate that the off-target effect of RITA inducing p53 via DNAdamagemasks the direct effect of RITA on p53. Although the Pol II\u2013mediated transcription repression upon high dose of NSC782846 can still be observed, itmight be due to the low-efficiency production of carbocation metabolites by sulfate elimination from sulfonated products causing DNA damage inWT cell lines, as shown in our model in Supplementary Fig. S5.\nThe multi-gene nature of cancer suggests that the targeting of a single gene is unlikely to produce a sustained effect (33). Targeting two or more unique alterations in cancer cells appears to be a more feasible approach to achieve therapeutic efficiency and selectivity and to prevent the development of drug resistance. Importantly, upon combination treatment the clinical toxicities of each compound will not overlap to permit their use in effective doses (34\u201336). Our data suggest that itmight be safe to use lowdoses of p53-specificRITA analogs, such as NSC782846, without SULT1A1-dependent lung toxicity, in combination with other target-specific drugs."
