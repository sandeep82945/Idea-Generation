    "abstractText": "The trap states and defects near the active region in deep-ultraviolet (DUV) light-emitting diodes (LED) were investigated through wavelength-dependent photocurrent spectroscopy. We observed anomalous photocurrent reversal and its temporal recovery in AlGaN-based DUV LEDs as the wavelength of illuminating light varied from DUV to visible. The wavelength-dependent photocurrent measurements were performed on 265 nm-emitting DUV LEDs under zero-bias conditions. Sharp near-band-edge (~265 nm) absorption was observed in addition to broad (300\u2013800 nm) visible-range absorption peaks in the photocurrent spectrum, while the current direction of these two peaks were opposite to each other. In addition, the current direction of the photocurrent in the visible wavelength range was reversed when a certain forward bias was applied. This bias-induced current reversal displayed a slow recovery time (~6 h) when the applied forward voltage was removed. Furthermore, the recovery time showed strong temperature dependency and was faster as the sample temperature increased. This result can be consistently explained by the presence of hole traps at the electron-blocking layer and the band bending caused by piezoelectric polarization fields. The activation energy of the defect state was calculated to be 279 meV using the temperature dependency of the recovery time.",

            "text": "Deep-ultraviolet (DUV) light consists of electromagnetic waves with wavelengths of 300 nm or lower and can be used in many applications, such as sterilization, water and air purification, medicine and biochemistry, photolithography, as light sources for high-density optical disks, and for chemical decomposition [1\u20134]. The DUV near 265 nm is known to be very effective in sterilizing viruses and has recently attracted more attention due to its effective capacity to break RNA viruses, such as COVID-19. Specific spectral lines from gas discharge lamps, such as xenon and mercury lamps, are currently used in these applications, which is an inconvenient and inefficient process. DUV light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are being used in these applications, as they are compact and highly efficient. Due to their wide direct transition energies in the ultraviolet (UV) range of 3.4 eV (GaN) to 6.2 eV (AlN), AlGaN compounds are being used as the active material in DUV LEDs [5\u20137].

Photocurrent Spectroscopy Photocurrent spectroscopy is a method used to measure photogenerated current depending on the wavelength of excitation light. When a reverse bias is applied to an LED, the carriers generated by light absorption in the MQW layer appear as a reverse current by the built-in electric field in the junction [13,14]. There are two conditions that must be satisfied for absorption to occur in the depletion region or in the MQW region. First, in order for the light to reach the active (depletion) region, the photon energy must be lower than that of the bandgap of the barrier, n-AlGaN, AlN, and sapphire substrates. Second, the photon energy of the incident light must be greater than the bandgap energy of the quantum wells (Al0.53Ga0.47N). Generally, no photocurrent is observed for the wavelength region longer than the absorption band of the QWs, and a photocurrent does not flow for wavelengths shorter than the absorption wavelength of the barriers (Al0.7Ga0.3N) since light is absorbed in the thick n-AlGaN layers. Therefore, the expected photocurrent spectrum will exhibit a peak. The photocurrent spectroscopy setup is shown in Figure 3. As seen in the figure, the measurement setup consists of a xenon lamp, a monochromator, and a source meter. Xenon lamps have an emission range of 200 nm\u2013800 nm. This can be converted to a single wavelength from 200 to 800 nm through a monochromator. A reverse voltage is applied to the sample, and the current is measured through the source meter while irradiating the sample with monochromatic light. The photocurrent spectrum shows the intensity of the photocurrent while changing the wavelength of light from the monochromator. LEDs typically have recovery times of a few \u00b5s after illumination [15]. The sweep rate of the monochromator was set to 1 nm in 1 s intervals, and the photocurrent value was obtained 1 s after each wavelength change in order to ensure a static value of the photocurrent.\nFigure 2.

As seen in Figure 6, a broad strong PL signal was observed with two broad peaks at 400 nm and 545 nm. It was reported that the Al vacancies in the AlN have deep-level defects that can cause emission at 387 nm and 445 nm and absorption at 375\u2013590 nm [19\u201321]. The observed PL peaks had a longer wavelength than the previously reported emission wavelength of Al vacancies in AlN. However, it should be noted that this result was observed in AlGaN-related DUV LEDs with Al composition ratios of 0.53 to 0.7. Since the bandgap energy of AlGaN is smaller than that of the AlN, the deep-level energy of the Al-vacancies may also be small. Our results imply that the defect-related below-gap photoabsorption should occur in the EBL or the EBL/p-AlGaN interface to account for the electric field reversal, which means the related defects should be spatially localized in these very thin layers. Therefore, we believe the photo-absorbing defect band is likely generated by the point defects, not by extended defects such as threading dislocations. In AlGaN, Al vacancy, N vacancy, substitutional oxygen, and the Al vacancy\u2013oxygen complex are known to generate deep-level states [19\u201321]. Considering the central wavelength of the PL peak, it is assumed that Al vacancy or the Al-vacancy\u2013oxygen complex is the dominant cause for these point defects [19\u201321], while further study is needed to specify the exact origin of these defects.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 10\nthe bandgap energy of the QWs.

The resulting spectrum of PL spectroscopy using a 325 nm He-Cd laser in a DUV LED.\nSince a forward current was observed at a wavelength above 300 nm, absorption occurred in a region other than the active region where the built-in electric field generated by the junction is located. This implies that an electric field in the opposite direction to the built-in electric field exists in the absorption layer. Since nitride compound semiconductors have a Wurtzite structure, a strong piezoelectric field (~ 1 MV/cm) exists when the structure deforms due to a difference in the lattice constant between the growth layers [22,23]. The EBL has a high Al content to block electron overflow and, therefore, has a smaller lattice constant than p-AlGaN. p-AlGaN, which has a relatively large lattice constant, can be subjected to compressive strain, and the direction of the formed piezoelectric field is in the opposite direction to the built-in electric field generated at the PN junction. Simulation results show that the piezoelectric field is generated by the strain between the QW and barrier or the EBL and p-AlGaN layers in AlGaN-based DUV LEDs [24]. It was shown that the direction of the piezoelectric field generated by the EBL in the p-AlGaN layer was in the opposite direction to that of the built-in electric field [24]. Therefore, we conclude that the photocurrent above 300 nm is generated in the Al vacancy present in pAlGaN and flows as a forward current due to the piezoelectric field. We investigated the temperature dependence of the recovery time to find the origin of the photocurrent\u2019s reversal at wavelengths over 300 nm in more detail. Measurements were made at four different temperatures: 26 \u00b0C (room temperature), 50 \u00b0C, 100 \u00b0C, and 150 \u00b0C. After the 4 V forward bias was applied at 15 min, as shown in Figure 5, the photocurrent was measured over time in the excitation light of 480 nm at zero bias. The results\nFigure 6. The resulting spectrum of PL spectroscopy using a 325 nm He-Cd laser in a DUV LED.\nSince a forward current was observed at a wavelength above 300 nm, absorption occurred in a region other than the active region where the built-in electric field generated by the junction is located. This implies that an electric field in the opposite direction to the built-in electric field exists in the absorption layer. Since nitride compound semiconductors have a Wurtzite structure, a strong piezoelectric field (~ 1 MV/cm) exists when the structure deforms due to a difference in the lattice constant between the growth layers [22,23]. The EBL has a high Al content to block electron overflow and, therefore, has a smaller lattice constant than p-AlGaN. p-AlGaN, which has a relatively large lattice constant, can be subjected to compressive strain, and the direction of the formed piezoelectric field is in the opposite direction to the built-in electric field generated at the PN junction. Simulation results show that the piezoelectric field is generated by the strain between the QW and barrier or the EBL and p-AlGaN layers in AlGaN-based DUV LEDs [24]. It was shown that the direction of the piezoelectric field generated by the EBL in the p-AlGaN layer was in the opposite direction to that of the built-in electric field [24]. Therefore, we conclude that the photocurrent above 300 nm is generated in the Al vacancy present in p-AlGaN and flows as a forward current due to the piezoelectric field. We investigated the temperature dependence of the recovery time to find the origin of the photocurrent\u2019s reversal at wavelengths over 300 nm in more detail. Measurements were made at four different temperatures: 26 \u25e6C (room temperature), 50 \u25e6C, 100 \u25e6C, and 150 \u25e6C. After the 4 V forward bias was a plied at 15 min, as shown in Fig re 5, the photocurre t was measured over time in the excitation light of 480 n at zero bias. The res lts are shown in Figure 7.

This photocurrent reversal phenomenon by forward bias disappeared at 150 \u25e6C and above. This means that all the trapped holes were thermally activated above 150 \u25e6C. The recovery time constant was calculated by fitting the photocurrent recovery to the double exponential decay, as in Equation (1), and the result is shown in Table 1.\nI(t) = A1e \u2212 t\u03c41 + A2e \u2212 t\u03c42 + I0 (1)\nMicromachines 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 10\nare shown in Figure 7.

As a result, the time constants decreased as the temperature increased and went to 0 when \u03c41 and \u03c42 equaled 100 \u00b0C and 150 \u00b0C, respectively. The exponential temperature dependence of the recovery time implies that the cause of the electric field reversal is associated with the charge traps. The trap states can be charged by the leakage current at 4 V of forward voltage, which is smaller than the turn-on voltage of the device. In this device, a significant leakage current was observed at 4 V of forward voltage. Carriers trapped in a deep-level state can create an electric field around themselves. As the trapped charge thermally escapes over time, the electric field strength decreases, and the activation becomes faster with increasing temperature. A deep carrier trap occurred in the path of the leakage current, as shown in Figure 8b, which can form an electric field larger than the piezoelectric field in the p-AlGaN layer. The layer in which the trap existed appears to be the EBL and p-AlGaN interface, and the trapped charges were holes, since, in this case, an electric field generated by the trapped charge was in the opposite direction to the piezoelectric field in p-AlGaN, as shown in Figure 8c. When the system was returned to a zero bias, the trapped holes were activated very slowly and exited the trap, returning to their original state, as shown in Figure 8a.\nFigure 7.

The electric field caused by the traps generated around the active layer compromised the operational stability of the device.

We report that the direct reversal of the photocurrent occurs in the DUV LED, caused by the immediate absorption region changes with the excitation wavelength, not by the direction of the applied electric field. We note here that the direction reversal of the photocurrent, depending on the excitation wavelength, can be potentially applicable in remote optical switches.\n4. Conclusions To analyze the defect states and their related absorption of the active region in DUV LEDs, we obtained photocurrent spectra as a function of applied bias and the sample temperature. We found several abnormal photocurrent reversal phenomena in the spectra. First, a photocurrent was generated in the 300 nm\u2013800 nm region with a photon energy lower than the bandgap energy of AlGaN in the opposite direction to that of the normal photocurrent by QW band-edge absorption. Second, after applying a forward 4 V bias, the direction of the photocurrent was reversed in the 300 nm\u2013800 nm range, and the direction of the reversed photocurrent recovered to its original direction after several hours at room temperature. To establish the cause of this phenomenon, PL measurements and temperature-dependent recovery time measurements were performed, and the absorption and emission spectra of AlGaN defects were investigated. We found that the cause of the abnormal photocurrent was carrier generation due to absorption in the 300 nm\u2013800 nm wavelength range by the Al vacancies generated near the p-AlGaN and EBL interface. In addition, it was attributed to the hole traps charged by the leakage current in the forward bias at the\nFigure 8.

The activation energy of the hole trap state was obtained by the temperature-dependent recovery time with the Arrhenius equation calculation. We found the activation energy of the trap level to be 279 meV. As a consequence of the above, AlGaN-based DUV LEDs have a high defect density that generates an unexpected electric field, which can adversely affect the operating characteristics, such as the efficiency, threshold voltage, and the leakage current of the device. Our results suggest that it is preferably required to minimize the point defect, such as Al vacancies in the EBL layer and/or at the EBL and p-AlGaN, rather than the dislocations or deep defects in the n-AlGaN and buffer layers, in order to avoid this unexpected sheet charge generation in AlGaN-based DUV LEDs. We believe our results, the wavelength-dependent reversal of the photocurrent, can also be utilized for long-range remote optical switches, such as in free-space laser satellite communication, where the contrast and reliability of the on/off signal are important since the on/off signal can be determined by the direction of the photocurrent other than the current amplitude.\nAuthor Contributions: Data curation, T.-S.K., J.K.
