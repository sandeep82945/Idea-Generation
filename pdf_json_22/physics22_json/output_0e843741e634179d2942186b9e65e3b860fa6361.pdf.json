    "abstractText": "We review various aspects of de Sitter spacetime in string theory: its status as an effective field theory spacetime solution, its relation to the vacuum energy problem in string theory, its (global) holographic definition in terms of two entangled and non-canonical conformal field theories, as well as a realization of a realistic de Sitter universe endowed with the observed visible matter and the necessary dark sector in order to reproduce the realistic cosmological structure. In particular, based on the new insight regarding the cosmological constant problem in string theory, we argue that in a doubled, T -duality-symmetric, phase-space-like and non-commutative generalizedgeometric formulation, string theory can naturally lead to a small and positive cosmological constant that is radiatively stable and technically natural. Such a formulation is fundamentally based on a quantum spacetime, but in an effective spacetime description of this general formulation of string theory, the curvature of the dual spacetime is the cosmological constant of the observed spacetime, while the size of the dual spacetime is the gravitational constant of the same observed spacetime. Also, the three scales associated with intrinsic non-commutativity of string theory, the cosmological constant scale and the Planck scale, as well as the Higgs scale, can be arranged to satisfy various seesaw-like formulae. Along the way, we show that these new features of string theory can be implemented in a particular deformation of cosmic-string-like models.

In particular, based on the new insight regarding the cosmological constant problem in string theory, we argue that in a doubled, T -duality-symmetric, phase-space-like and non-commutative generalizedgeometric formulation, string theory can naturally lead to a small and positive cosmological constant that is radiatively stable and technically natural. Such a formulation is fundamentally based on a quantum spacetime, but in an effective spacetime description of this general formulation of string theory, the curvature of the dual spacetime is the cosmological constant of the observed spacetime, while the size of the dual spacetime is the gravitational constant of the same observed spacetime. Also, the three scales associated with intrinsic non-commutativity of string theory, the cosmological constant scale and the Planck scale, as well as the Higgs scale, can be arranged to satisfy various seesaw-like formulae. Along the way, we show that these new features of string theory can be implemented in a particular deformation of cosmic-string-like models.\nDedicated to the memory of Joe Polchinski and Steve Weinberg\n\u2217per.berglund@unh.edu \u2020thubsch@howard.edu \u2021dminic@vt.edu\nar X\niv :2\n21 2.\n06 08\n6v 3\n[ he\npth\n] 8\nF eb\nContents"

In fact, the details of cosmological evolution are more demanding: This coveted solution of string theory, with all its degrees of freedom, must also accommodate all the observations typically modeled by the inflationary expansion and other particulars of our universe, including the so-called H0-tension [7] and other challenges of the Standard \u039bCDM Model [8]. Fortunately and as we will discuss below, string theory harbors a multitude of degrees of freedom, some of which turn out to be hidden (dark) to the matter of the particle physics Standard Model, and such that their cumulative effects model the asymptotically de Sitter spacetime, while their particulars help modeling other details of the cosmological evolution.1\nWe aim to frame \u201ca discussion of a few key issues\u201d2 that warrants a particular extension of effective field theory and showcases some of its relevant consequences along the way. We address the question of the existence of de Sitter spacetime in string theory, including the crucial problem of vacuum energy (the cosmological constant problem). We summarize the recent new insight about this crucial problem and we emphasize the relation between the quantum spacetime (phase-space) aspects of string theory and how they mesh with the requirements of holography in order to provide a radiatively stable and technically natural cosmological constant. Based on this central insight we discuss a holographic definition of de Sitter spacetime, and argue that there is an important lesson that can be drawn from these considerations, that reinforces a T -duality-symmetric, chiral and intrinsically noncommutative formulation of string theory, called the metastring. Such a formulation can, in principle, accommodate the observed universe with a small and positive cosmological constant and the visible and dark sectors needed for the realistic cosmological structure.\nWe contrast this new view with the more familiar spacetime-geometric form usually associated with the standard and well studied low-energy effective point-field theory limit of string theory [10\u201314]. We also comment on the small and positive cosmological constant in this context. Our central point here is that de Sitter spacetime is realized in a generalizedgeometric and non-commutative, phase-space-like doubled formulation of string theory, for which the familiar local effective field theory is not a generic limit.\nAt a coarsest initial approach in this novel framework, we find that the curvature of the dual spacetime serves the cosmological constant of the observed spacetime, whereas the size of the dual spacetime determines the gravitational constant in the observed spacetime.

We contrast our viewpoint with the recent discussion in the literature.\nThis report starts firmly rooted in a brief and filtering review of the key approaches to finding de Sitter space in string theory in Section 2; here we present the facets of the core problem of finding de Sitter vacua in string theory while following the standard approach via Effective Field Theory (EFT). A detailed discussion of a particular deformation family of toy models [15\u201318] in Section 3 reveals a seesaw UV/IR correlation and the inherent nonperturbativity of such solutions. In the next three sections we address: the vacuum energy problem and its various implications (Section 4), the holographic formulation of de Sitter spacetime (Section 5), and the realistic de Sitter universe filled with the observed visible as well as dark matter needed for structure formation (Section 6).

            "text": "There have been many attempts at finding de Sitter spacetime (dS) in string theory, as detailed in the excellent recent reviews [3,4] and their extensive reference lists; see also [19,20] as well as [9] and references therein for earlier reviews. Here we highlight some quite well known sources (such as [21] and [22]) and also revisit the lesser known Refs. [15,16].\nIn the generally accepted and standardly practiced approach [11\u201314], by now formulated in an undergraduate textbook [23], string theory leads to a low-energy effective (point-)field theory (EFT) action for Einstein\u2019s gravity (we concentrate on the observed 4-dimensional case, regardless of how this is reached; see however below) in the familiar format:\nSeff = \u2212 \u222b d4x \u221a g ( 1\n8\u03c0G \u039b +\n1\n16\u03c0G R + aR\u00b5\u03bdR\n\u00b5\u03bd + bR2 + cR\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3R \u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 + . . . ) , (2.1)\nwhere the coefficients a, b, c as well as the omitted terms are completely determined by the renormalization of the underlying worldsheet theory [24, 25]. Producing a positive and an uncharacteristically small cosmological constant \u039b turns out to be a very difficult task, at least by following this usual formulation of string theory. Besides the notorious difficulty of obtaining a \u039b that is uncharacteristically small as compared with usual characteristic energyscales of the EFT, the additional difficulty of obtaining \u039b> 0 is exacerbated by the standard focus on models which at least start out with some supersymmetry: de Sitter spacetime is well known to admit no supersymmetry [26]. So, while the presence of supersymmetry, subsequently broken in some technically manageable fashion, does help both with computability in concrete models and with general features, it also narrows the search by considerations of technical management. This very general \u201clamppost\u201d approach is in no way guaranteed to lead to such a demanding solution.\nIn what follows, we argue that a more general formulation does lead to a positive cosmological constant, \u039b. This more general formulation is in fact more natural from the point\nof view of the intrinsic structure of string theory, and involves a doubled, non-commutative and generalized geometry. This formulation is in fact also indicated by a more careful reexamination of the EFT solutions such as the discretuum of specific axion-dilaton (axilaton)3 solutions [15, 17, 18] that deform the Minkowski models of Refs. [27\u201330]. We thus first concentrate on this standard and thoroughly familiar EFT approximation of string theory, its compactifications and brane-world scenarios. See also the very recent comprehensive EFTfocused review [31], which also provides an impressive survey of the related literature.\nThe general message of various attempts to find de Sitter spacetime via compactifications in string theory is as follows: It is possible, if na\u0308\u0131vely, to realize dS in these EFT spacetime constructions. What is not clear is whether these attempts are safe from various perils, including the crucial questions of stability, and how generic they are. (The community seems to be divided on these points.) Even so, we argue below that this approach misses an important physics point: All these constructions and analyses are conducted within the context of an effective field theory spacetime interpretation of string theory, which is not generic, whereby the search for dS solution in string theory from this viewpoint cannot possibly be exhaustive and conclusive.\nTo this end, we re-examine in the next section a particular family of axilaton braneworld cosmological models which does produce a de Sitter spacetime. Highlighting its main characteristics and implications turns out to relate to our main point, stated later below. Suffice it here to note that the iterative development of these axilaton models is as follows: Starting from a deformed co-dimension 2 solution (motivated, in part by [32]) with a natural connection to a logarithmic running of coupling constants,4 we find a deep connection to a non-supersymmetric phase of F -theory, the conjectured non-perturbative formulation of the IIB string, via the stringy cosmic strings. Rather unexpectedly from this EFT point of view, this model does accommodate de Sitter spacetime and automatically produces a seesaw mechanism generating a small cosmological constant. Also, although the axilaton models are non-supersymmetric for most of their parameters, they do have a well-defined supersymmetric limit \u2014 located centrally in their parameter space. Thereby, this axilaton deformation family of models may be regarded as showcasing cosmological supersymmetry breaking deformations of a generic supersymmetric configuration in F -theory.\nFurthermore, this turns out to be connected to a deconstruction of the cosmological constant when extending from 3-dimensional to 4-dimensional spacetime, which pivots on the old observation of Witten [33] about the peculiar features of supersymmetry in 3 dimensions: Due to the presence of conical defects in 3-dimensional gravity, the supercharges do not have\n3The admittedly frivolous contraction \u201caxilaton\u201d reminds that the family of cosmological brane-world models developed in Refs. [15,16,27\u201330] are driven by the background values of the axio-dilaton system and their SL(2,Z) monodromy in the extra 2-dimensional plane. The succinct name also saves us from repeated circumlocutions that perforce include the above-cited reference sequence.\n4This is a unique feature of codimension-2 solutions, which owes to the well-known logarithmic nature of\nGreen\u2019s function in 2-dimensional space.\nto be globally defined. Therefore, supersymmetry does not necessarily imply masses of superpartners to be degenerate, as the mass-splitting is controlled by the strength of the conical defects. The deconstruction performed in Ref. [34] (see also Ref. [35]) produces a 4-dimensional version of Witten\u2019s argument, albeit now controlled by stringy defects. These stringy defects are generically strongly coupled in the 4-dimensional continuum limit, and are easily related to the non-supersymmetric stringy cosmic strings in the axilaton deformation family of models. The same holds also for the ensuing seesaw formula for the cosmological constant: Mvac \u223c M2/MP , where Mvac is the vacuum energy/cosmological constant scale, MP the Planck scale, and M the characteristic particle physics scale. 5\nOur main point (see Section 4) is that the chirally doubled (phase-space like), noncommutative generalized-geometric formulation of string theory does lead, and naturally, to a positive cosmological constant and asymptotically dS backgrounds. Essentially and in a coarsest approximation, the curvature of the dual space plays the role of the cosmological constant in the observed spacetime, and the size of the dual space is the gravitational constant in the same observed spacetime. Also, the three scales associated with intrinsic non-commutativity of string theory, the cosmological constant scale and the gravitational constant (Planck) scale, as well as the Higgs scale, are naturally arranged via seesaw formulae. Our showcasing discretuum of axilaton toy models illustrates all these main points, but is not at all isolated: For example, these models bear some striking similarities to the recently analyzed de Sitter bubbles in unstable AdS backgrounds [37\u201340]. In a somewhat similar vein, a recent analysis of hyperbolic compactifications of M -theory are found to accommodate a \u201crelatively simple\u201d (albeit meta-stable) de Sitter uplift as well as cosmological inflation within hyperbolic (negative curvature) compactifications of M -theory [41]."

In de Sitter spacetime the spacetime boundaries I\u00b1 are Euclidean surfaces at early and late time infinity. The extrinsic curvature boundary term is necessary to allow a well-defined Euler-Lagrange variation.\nIt is usually convenient to define a corresponding length scale\nl\u039b =\n\u221a (d\u22121)(d\u22122)\n2\u039b , (2.3)\nwhich itself does depend on the dimension (d) of the spacetime, but the order of magnitude of which does not change much.6 Using this notation, the vacuum dS spacetime solution to the equations of motion that follow from the variation of the above action \u03b4SB = 0, is\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + l\u039b2 cosh2(t/l\u039b) d\u21262d\u22121 (2.4)\nwhere equal time sections are (d\u22121)-spheres.

This is also called an inflationary patch. By replacing \u03c4 by \u2212\u03c4 a patch which covers the other half of de Sitter (from past infinity to a future horizon) can be obtained. We will refer to these two patches as the \u201cbig bang\u201d and the \u201cbig crunch\u201d patches. Finally, an inertial observer in dS spacetime sees a static spacetime with a cosmological horizon:\nds2 = \u2212(1\u2212 r2/l\u039b2) dt2 + (1\u2212 r2/l\u039b2)\u22121dr2 + r2d\u21262d\u22122 (2.6)\nThe relations between these coordinate patches and Penrose diagrams are presented in the classic book by S.

This formal transformation (sometimes accompanied by additional Wick rotations of some of the coordinates) takes patches of de Sitter into patches anti-de Sitter spacetime (AdS). For example, the static patch (2.5) rotates to global AdS. Likewise, by redefining exp(\u03c4/l\u039b) = r/l\u039b and carrying out some formal analytic continuations gives the Poincare\u0301 patch of AdS. Tracking these continuations through the classic computations of properties of AdS spaces gives a powerful method of inferring some aspects of de Sitter physics. We will comment more about this in the section on holography in de Sitter spacetime.\n6For example, for d= 10 vs. d= 4-dimensional spacetime, the relative ratio is l(10)\u039b / l(4)\u039b = \u221a 9\u00b78 3\u00b72 \u2248 3.46."

This concern is usually addressed by: (1) citing the above-enumerated assumptions and a careful arrangement the computations (the \u201crules of the game\u201d), and (2) specifying that one is \u201cworking in a fine-tuned corner of the moduli space, where the weakly coupled space-time solution is argued to be a good approximation to the full string theory solution\u201d [3]. These complementing assumptions are then argued to insure that the resulting value of the cosmological constant in this self-consistent framework of flux compactifications is fairly close to its actual value, and safe from the otherwise typical quantum field-theoretic sensitivity to UV cutoff energies.\nFinding a phenomenologically acceptably small and positive cosmological constant within this general approach seems highly improbable upon surveying numerous attempts in the reviewed literature [3, 4]. In turn, a phenomenologically acceptable cosmological constant determined by the minimum of an effective potential such as in (2.7) has in fact been argued to be outright incompatible with quantum gravity [5, 6]. Without a feasible de Sitter spacetime solution, this line of reasoning then only allows for modeling the details of the observed cosmology with quintessence \u2014 which models then have their own challenges and difficulties. Typically, these include a high degree of fine-tuning: For one, the mass of the scalar field does get quadratically divergent corrections (as do masses of all scalars in 4d, such as the Higgs) inducing the standard hierarchy problem. Here however, this problem\n7In the Brane-World cosmological scenarios such as pioneered in [44] extra dimensions may well have a\nlarge extent, but are highly curved, and it is this curvature length-scale that is relevant in this context.\nis much more serious. The mass of the scalar field in quintessence models must be very small (typically \u223c 10\u221233 eV) so as to \u201cfit\u201d the observed dark energy scale, exacerbating the standard Planck/Higgs \u223c 1017 mass-scale hierarchy problem to a Planck/quintessence \u223c 1061 problem! Furthermore, this scalar will also contribute to the cosmological constant problem, so that the dark energy problem does not really seem to be solved from a quantum perspective. Even on the observational side, quintessence tends to induce too low a value for the Hubble constant (H0) [45, 46]; see also [47].\nWithin this standard EFT-relying approach and fairly generally, one can distinguish three\nbroad classes of options [3]:\nNon-critical string theory: Here, the effective action in the string frame has an extra contribution that for dimensions larger than critical can be understood as a positive contribution to the effective potential. The problem with this option is that one does not have a control over the perturbative sector of these models; see [48].\nCritical string theory, with no known classical geometry: This so-called nongeometric route relies on the non-geometric (Q and R) fluxes, and in that case one has an increase in the number of parameters. In such cases, one may be able to find metastable dS vacua in principle, although such models tend to be very scarce; see [49].\nCritical string theory, with classical geometry: In this, geometric route, one typically starts with 10d supergravity with fluxes at the two-derivative level. The effective potential has two terms: one coming from curvature of the extra dimensions and the other coming from the flux terms. Schematically, in 10 dimensions and using the notation of Danielsson and Van Riet [3], we have:\nSeff =\n\u222b \u221a |g| (1\n2 R\u2212 1 2 \u2016\u2202\u03c6\u20162 \u2212 \u2211 p cp e ap\u03c6Fp 2 ) + CS (2.8)\nwhere \u201cCS \u201d denotes the Chern Simons terms and Fp are the appropriate rank-p field strengths of 10d supergravity (p is odd for IIB and even for IIA supergravity). Then the effective potential is found to be composed of a term coming from the curvature of 6 extra dimensions and the flux term:\nV = \u2212 \u222b \u221a g6 R6 + \u222b \u221a g6 cp e ap\u03c6Fp 2 (2.9)\nLocalized brane sources include an extra term to the effective potential\nVsrc = \u00b5 \u222b \u221a |gn| (2.10)\nwhere \u00b5 denotes the brane\u2019s tension and gn is the determinant of the 10d metric pulled-back onto the internal submanifold wrapped by the brane.\nThe no-go theorem of Maldacena and Nunez [50] asserts that it is impossible to obtain a dS background if the space is static, compact and without singularities. While adding D-branes does not help, orientifolds (which provide negative tension) can help, but there are further no-go theorems in this case as well [19,51], which are in general expected to be resolved by stringy UV completion [52\u201354]. Indeed, classical solutions that include appropriate backreactions have been constructed [55,56].\nMost of the approaches to dS space in string theory start with classical flux compactifications with orientifold sources and by looking at various quantum effects that stabilize the moduli. Perhaps the best understood are type IIB string theory models [57]; see also [58]. This analysis leads to the following main groups of \u201cuplift-vacuum\u201d scenarios: KachruKallosh-Linde-Trivedi (KKLT) [21], as well as the \u201c(racetrack) Ka\u0308hler uplift\u201d (RKU) [59\u201361] and the related \u201clarge volume scenario\u201d (LVS) [22,62,63].\nLet us provide here but a telegraphic summary of a few salient features: (1) The KKLT and LVS scenarios both rely on the inclusion of a D3-brane (anti-D3-brane) to break supersymmetry spontaneously by lifting the overall energy, following the over two decades old exploration of \u201cbrane supersymmetry breaking.\u201d For a comprehensive description of the role of the D3-brane in producing a de Sitter spacetime in the KKLT framework, see [64]; for the fully (linearly and nonlinearly realized) supersymmetric analysis see [65]. Issues with loss of parametric control owing to strong warping have been discussed in [66]. (2) The LVS formalism was, besides breaking supersymmetry spontaneously and generating the AdS \u2192 dS uplift with a D3-brane, also found to induce a logarithmic distribution (in the string landscape) of the supersymmetry breaking scale [67]. Warping corrections are here also found to likely induce a loss of parametric control [68\u201370]. (3) The RKU scenario avoids using D3-branes to break supersymmetry and generate the AdS\u2192 dS uplift, but finds it possible to generate a metastable dS vacuum by balancing 3-form fluxes and D7-branes against leading order perturbative O(\u03b1\u2032 3)-corrections to the Ka\u0308hler potential. These three scenarios are in fact closely related, and several variations and combinations have been considered in the literature [61] (4) In turn, recent study [71] shows that a careful balancing of various contributions (D3-branes, Whitney branes [72,73]) near a (warped deformed) conifold locus in the moduli space permits a metastable 3+1-dimensional de Sitter spacetime; see \u00a7 2.5. (5) The KKLT scenario was also rather quickly extended to also provide for cosmic inflation [74].\nGiven the variety in details of these approaches and the so-called totalitarian principle,8 one should expect that at least certain aspects of all of these scenarios ultimately contribute to the realization of dS spacetime in string theory. It is then, naturally, the intricacies of the interplay between the various details of the involved effects (rather than the isolated\n8\u201cEverything not forbidden is compulsory\u201d [75] has been heavily popularized by M. Gell-Mann as the\nchief overarching tenet of quantum physics, and is often misattributed to him.\ncharacteristics of any particular one of them) that will decide on the viability of this program. In turn, such careful balancing tends to depend on the technical details of the concrete models considered, and the ultimate outcome may well, a priori, be sensitive to next-order and even higher perturbative corrections.\nThis analysis can be extended also to the type IIA and heterotic models, and the results generally turn out rather similar to the canonical type IIB case. Furthermore, it is of course phenomenologically relevant to distinguish models in these categories by the energy where supersymmetry appears effectively broken, i.e., whether the supersymmetry-breaking massscale is as high as the Ka luz\u0307a-Klein scale or below it, and how close it is to experimentally attainable energies. Finally, let us summarize several of the key concerns arising in all of these approaches (see also [3]):\nClassical concerns: There are no known classical 4d de Sitter solutions that are free of tachyons. One simple argument for this is as follows: Of all terms contributing to the scalar potential, the orientifold tension is negative, which at some critical point of the potential and generically, signals the growth of a tachyonic direction. Most probably then, the 4d (broken) supergravity effective description of dS is problematic.\nGeometric vs. non-geometric concerns: One distinction between geometric and nongeometric is that the non-geometric vacua are not T -duals of geometric ones. Also, there is an issue whether the non-geometric solutions are locally geometric. From all known metastable dS vacua of the non-geometric (double field theory like) approach, none are locally geometric, and thus they are hard to interpret as the observed dS vacua.\nQuantum concerns: These include (a) anti-brane back-reaction inside extra dimensions, (b) anti-brane back-reaction on the moduli (see [51]), and perhaps the most severe, (c) generic issues with non-supersymmetric Giddings-Kachru-Polchinski (GKP) solutions [57]. Given the various string-string dualities connecting the type II and the heterotic theories, it is reasonable to inquire how do the various constraints on heterotic models reflect on type II models [76]. This detailed study employs several different dualities and finds that while de Sitter solutions are not necessarily ruled out, they invariably \u201cmust involve an unconventional, or at least hard-to-compute ingredient.\u201d In particular, inclusion of anti-branes and orientifolds does not pass this threshold of unconventionality. This detailed study is however rather carefully framed in exhibiting the key reliance on EFT, and finds that there indeed is a universal issue with the effective field theory constructions. Similarly, a recent analysis of the quantum back-reaction of thermal matter in a dS spacetime suggests the need for a phase-transition around the string-scale, Ms<MP , and a \u201cstill mysterious, presumably topological, high-temperature regime of string theory\u201d [77]; see also [78]."

            "text": "The above, rather general conclusions strongly depend on several of the above-listed assumptions of the standardly adopted EFT-relying framework. Even so, specially tuned and somewhat exceptionally \u201cbalanced\u201d models have been found that do produce a phenomenologically acceptable de Sitter spacetime even within this self-consistent framework; for example, see [71].\nMore to the point however, we argue below against relying on several of the abovelisted assumptions, and especially against neglecting the stringy winding modes. Indeed, as presented below and in the next section, a discretuum of toy axilaton models with dS spacetime [15\u201318] initially developed following this standard approach to string theory turns out to invalidate several of the above assumptions, and so motivates our subsequent survey of a more general approach. With Section 3 reviewing the details of the construction, here we summarize several of the key aspects by which these models evade the above-mentioned difficulties and indicate that an approach beyond EFT is needed.\nThe axilaton toy models: First, these models [15\u201318] stem from a non-perturbative configuration of IIB string theory \u2014 namely the D7-brane [32], which is a stringy cosmic string like configuration [79, 80]: a codimensionsion 2 solution in 10 dimensions. Now, this non-perturbative configuration is deformed in our toy models [15, 16], which turn out to be non-perturbative [17], and so immediately violate one of the assumptions of the canonical approach to dS via string compactifications. The other important aspect is that the model mixes UV and IR scales (precisely because of its codimensionsion 2 nature) and thus it violates the assumption regarding the separation of scales in the canonical approaches. Also, the model can be understood as an S-fold in the context of a doubled formulation [18], in which, generically the \u201cwould be winding modes\u201d are kept as coordinates of a dual spacetime, which, in general, does not commute with the observed spacetime.\nSecond, the cosmological constant is stabilized via an effective non-commutative field theory [18]. To the lowest order in the non-commutativity parameter (the size of the string), this can be treated as a sequestered effective field theory [81, 82]. Thus the cosmological constant, or vacuum energy, is natural, by the seesaw formula of the toy model [15\u201317], and radiatively stable. Analogous arguments apply to the stabilization of the moduli of the K3 space in these toy models, which involve a co-dimension two solution in six dimensional spacetime, where the extra four dimensions are compactified into a K3. These moduli are also subject to a non-commutative effective field theory, and thus to a sequestered effective field theory treatment.\nThird, the axilaton toy models are non-holomorphic deformations of the stringy cosmic string, and thereby break supersymmetry \u2014 but again in a way that can be understood from a general formulation of string theory. In fact, the axilaton models interpolate\nnon-holomorphically between two distinct holomorphic superstring solutions [17]. This supersymmetry breaking should be treated as the stabilization of vacuum energy, via the non-commutative field theory involved, and its sequestered effective field theory limit. This supersymmetry breaking is thereby \u201ccosmological\u201d and directly related to the seesaw formula for the cosmological constant of the effective four dimensional dS space.\nFurthermore, the axilaton solution matches the two fundamental backgrounds of string theory, the axion and dilaton, with the two dimensional transverse space, and in this sense is somewhat similar to what happens in non-critical string theory, where the Liouville field, originating from the conformal anomaly, leads to one extra dimension. Axilatons appear in other situations as effective moduli, so that this discretuum of models can be translated also into that context.\nAlternatively, it is also possible to treat the dS 4d spacetime as (the Lorentzian Wickrotation of) the exceptional set of a resolution of a singularity in a Calabi-Yau (complex) 5- fold, which in turn is itself a Euclidean Wick-rotation of the 10d spacetime of type IIB strings [17]. Via this Wick-rotation, this relates the resolution of a singularity in the (auxiliary) Euclidean picture to the emergence of the cosmological constant in the (actual) Lorentzian geometry of spacetime.\nIn turn, these various non-standard features of the axilaton models fit naturally within a recent reformulation of string theory [83, 84] and its particle-like limit [85]. The crucial feature here is that string theory is revealed to have a non-commutative and chirally doubled target spacetime with a phase-space like structure. Therein, the familiar, \u201cvisible\u201d target spacetime (x) of string theory has a non-commuting dual (x\u0303): [x\u00b5, x\u0303\u03bd ] =\u03bb 2\u03b4\u00b5\u03bd . This affords a continuum of distinct polarizations, i.e., \u201crepresentations\u201d or \u201cpictures.\u201d The usual string theory (including double field theory) is a commutative limit of this non-commutative formulation. This is analogous to the so-called Seiberg-Witten limit of non-commutative field theories [86] found in open string theory in B-backgrounds. This commutative limit is quite useful in practical calculations, but it is a singular limit: In it the general non-commutative observables appear as degenerate, and this limit must therefore be interpreted with care. Our formulation is closer to the Grosse-Wulkenhaar formulation [87], which is intrinsically non-commutative and is formulated with a doubled UV/IR covariant regulator. As such this formulation does not suffer from UV/IR mixing, and it does have a well defined and non-trivial continuum limit.\nFinally, the axilaton toy models are not supersymmetric, and their results require additional care and justification. The underlying logic of the usual approach is that supersymmetric constructions are controllable and reliable in calculations. This of course always brings up the question of the inherently non-supersymmetric nature of dS spacetime, as well as the fact that both general relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics are non-supersymmetric. The basic point here is that if the axilaton toy models are embedded within this non-commutative, chirally doubled, phase-space like general formulation of string theory, then this provides the technical stability instead of supersymmetry. To wit: In the\ncase of double field theory [88\u201390], it is found that the uniqueness of certain crucial geometric data (more precisely, the uniqueness of the connection in the context of generalized geometry) is predicated upon supersymmetry. On the other hand, the non-commutatively and chirally doubled target spacetime with a phase-space like structure exhibits the so-called Born geometry, which features a symplectic structure (but no supersymmetry), and which also guarantees the uniqueness of the connection [91]. In this technical sense, the symplectic structure replaces supersymmetry as a powerful underlying structure in the context of Born geometry and the general non-commutative phase-space like bosonic formulation of string theory, the metastring. It is natural to conjecture that metastring theory does possess a complete structural (and utilitarian) analogue of supersymmetry9 that is based on the robustness of Born geometry, viewed as the geometry of general quantum theory. We will return to this point below."

            "heading": "2.3 Swampland, Landscape and All That",
            "text": "One possible implication of the approach to dS via flux compactifications is that string theory leads to the concept of landscape of vacua [9, 92], and that as such it represents a complex system [93, 94]. This then should be studied using techniques from complex systems, such as spin glasses, protein folding etc., ultimately leading to the implementation of machine learning and AI technology [95]. The key question then is the evaluation of measures on the landscape [96], and there exists a holographic measure for the cosmological constant [97].\nThe string landscape is sometimes put together with the multiverse picture [98] of eternal inflation, and also with the anthropic principle, the latter of which is used to argue for a small and positive cosmological constant, following Weinberg\u2019s classic work [99\u2013101]. All this raises fundamental questions regarding the predictability of string theory (and eternal inflation). Note that the problem of finding dS space in string theory is also related to finding inflation in string theory with natural slow-roll parameters.\nAnother possibility considered in the recent literature is that there is no dS in canonical string theory compactifications, which forces us to model the cosmological evolution of the universe with a quintessence model of dark energy. This idea is compatible with the swampland approach, which seeks to find general constraints on the coupling of effective field theories to quantum gravity, which is incompletely understood and so is typically modeled by standard approaches to string theory. While other approaches to quantizing gravity do exist, it has been argued that those are in fact special limits of string theory [102]. Although this contention does require considerable further analysis for an ultimate confirmation (or\n9In particular, it is tempting to suppose that the structure of Born geometry, perhaps amended by some natural restrictions such as anomaly cancellation, can provide for some non-renormalization theorems akin to supersymmetry, and consequently insure the existence of \u201cquasi-topological\u201d sectors. As discussed in \u00a7 6.1 and definitions (6.3) in particular, Born geometry features a hallmark triple of mutually anticommuting complex structures, which may well provide a rigidity comparable to supersymmetry.\ncorrection), it behoves to recall the well known fact that the \u201cquantum-to-classical\u201d limit mapping is \u201cmany-to-one\u201d: There almost always exist multiple different quantum theories that have the same given classical (and even semi-classical) limit.\nTherefore, aiming for an effective Standard Model-like quantum field theory coupled to Einstein gravity in the classical limit, including the \u201csemiclassical gravity\u201d approach, cannot possibly suffice in singling out the complete underlying quantum theory. This is where we use the underlying string theory for guidance, in that \u2014 whatever the ultimate theory of quantum gravity may turn out to be, we assume it will share the self-consistent characteristics that can be gleaned from string theory. This is sometimes referred to as the String Universality or the String Lamppost Principle [103]. Furthermore, we argue herein that this coveted goal requires a string theory framework [83, 84] that is more refined than the standard description [11\u201314].\nA Baker\u2019s Dozen of Swampland Criteria and Conjectures: A notion developed over the last two decades, that the vast landscape of string theory models is in fact immersed within an even larger collection, dubbed swampland, of self-consistent semiclassical effective field theories, which are however inconsistent as quantum theories when gravity is incorporated [104]. Subsequent work refined this notion and resulted in a collection of increasingly better refined statements, starting with the so-called Swampland Criteria [6,105]; see also the lectures [106]. These preemptive requirements imply that the envisioned effective field theory description of models coupled to quantum gravity breaks down if either of the following two circumstances occurs:\n1. The scalar quantum fields \u03c6i in the model (such as the moduli) vary much more than\nO(1) in natural units [107\u2013111].\n2. The logarithmic gradient of the potential of those scalar fields (|\u2207\u03c6iV |/V ) varies much more than O(1) in natural units [5, 6, 105,112]; see also [113,114].\nThe first of these criteria is complementary to the so-called swampland distance conjecture (\u201cSDC\u201d) [107], in that they pertain to the ultimately opposite extremes in field variations:\n3. Given two infinitely distant values of a moduli field, \u3008\u03c61\u3009 and \u3008\u03c62\u3009, the infinite tower of massive states at \u3008\u03c61\u3009, with the characteristic mass-scale M\u3008\u03c61\u3009, collapses to a heap of massless states at \u3008\u03c62\u3009: M\u3008\u03c62\u3009 \u223cM\u3008\u03c61\u3009 e\u2212\u03b1d(\u3008\u03c61\u3009,\u3008\u03c62\u3009), \u03b1 > 0; see also [108,115,116].\n4. As an immediate corollary of 3, extending an EFT to an infinitely distant value of some\nmoduli field collapses infinitely many states to become massless \u2014 which therefore must stem from a new massless extended object, i.e., new physics,10 such as in [121\u2013123]; see also [124].\n10Notice that, e.g., the \u201cconifold\u201d points are in the physically relevant (Weil-Petersson-Zamolodchikov) metric at finite [117], in fact O(1) distance [115] in higher-dimensional moduli spaces; they presumably host \u201cnew physics,\u201d but are undetected by just the SDC, listed as item 4 above. In turn, the \u03c8\u2192\u221e limit in\nWe continue with the key conjectured properties of consistently gravitational EFTs following the comprehensive, detailed and much recommended surveys in [103, 125\u2013127]; for a recent, astrophysically minded survey, see [128]. In most statements, we also provide some pointers to additional literature, and we number the properties continuing the swampland criteria, since these statements are closely interrelated.\n5. No symmetry is global and exact in a gravitational EFT; it is either gauged or broken,\nor was approximate to begin with [129,130].\n6. There can only be a finite number of massless fields in a gravitational EFT. (By its\nnature, this is an observation about most and well-understood models; in fact, the emergence of an infinite number of massless fields is accepted as an indication of a massless/tensionless extended object or decompactification, i.e., some new physics.11)\n7. There are no free/independent parameters in a gravitational EFT; all parameters are\nvacuum expectation values of corresponding quantum fields. (By its nature, this conjecture is both a credo of ultimate unification in physics, as well as an observation of circumstances of string theory.)\n8. A d-dimensional theory of quantum gravity can be compactified only on k-dimensional\ncompact spaces of trivial cobordism class [133]. (This conjectured complete connectivity is the ultimate generalization of the early indications of \u2018rolling connections\u2019 among string vacua [134\u2013136].)\n9. A gravitational EFT with a gauge symmetry group G, states of all possible G-charges\nconsistent with Dirac quantization must exist [137,138].\n10. A d-dimensional gravitational EFT with a p-form U(1) gauge symmetry and gauge\ncoupling ep has the following weak gravitational conjecture (\u201cWGC\u201d) bounds [139,140]:\n(a) Electric WGC: At least one (p\u22121)-brane must have its tension, Tp (T1 =m), and charge, qp, satisfy the inequality \u221a p(d\u2212p\u22122) d\u22122 Tp6 qp ep (M (d) P ) d\u22122 2 . (b) Magnetic WGC: The UV cutoff scale of the EFT is bounded by the relation\n\u039bUV . ( ep (M (d) P ) d\u22122)1/2p.\nThe generalization to multiple U(1)s results in the Convex Hull Condition, which is more restrictive than the conjecture applied to each U(1) gauge symmetry separately.\n11. Non-supersymmetric AdS vacua must be unstable in quantum gravity [114]; in fact,\nthis is argued to be the case for all non-supersymmetric vacua [103].\nthe Dwork family of quintics [118, 119] corresponds to a highly singular model, quite likely inducing the string compactification to include \u201cnew\u201d extended objects, suggesting that SDC may not not be a sufficient predictor of \u201cnew physics\u201d; see also the novel results on conifold transitions [120]. 11On the face of it, this conjecture excludes some more exotic proposals with infinitely many massless fields. Such is the example of so-called Vasiliev gravity [131], which however can be reinterpreted in terms of tensionless strings [132], and thereby as corroborating this conjecture.\n12. A d-dimensional EFT with Ns particle states is weakly coupled to gravity below the\nenergy scale \u039bs = M (d) P / d\u22122 \u221a Ns.\n13. In a gravitational EFT in a 4-dimensional dS background, the mass of every charged\nparticle must satisfy m2 & eqM (4)P H, where H is the Hubble constant [141,142].\nCommentary: The criteria 1 and 2 are restated so as to remind of the standard expectations in the classical treatment of small oscillations: small field variations within a regime of a slowly varying potential, respectively. Here however the inclusion of quantum gravity provides the natural, Planckian units for the field space.12 Indeed, even the formulation of the second of these (list item 2 above) is predicated on the existence of a semi-classically behaving effective potential for the considered fields. This then in fact corroborates one of the main claims herein: that the effective field theory description of fundamental physics cannot be complete.\nFurthermore, conjecture 3 implies that an EFT with quantum gravity formulated at any particular point in the moduli space cannot possibly be used consistently to describe the situation at an infinitely distant point in the moduli space; see also the statements 4 and 6 in the listing above.\nStatements 6 and 7 in the above listing are generalized from direct observations in all known string theory models, and those explicitly exclude ostensibly esoteric field theory models, such as those with infinitely many massless fields [131].\nAlso, a closer analysis of several of the above statements indicate a key role of backreaction, which present issues that cannot seem to be resolved within EFT, such as the \u201cWeak Gravity Conjecture\u201d (list item 10 above) in systems that include extended objects [143]. Furthermore, so-called axionic strings indicate an \u201ceffective breakdown\u201d of EFT [144]. In turn, WGC has recently also been used to argue that a phenomenologically acceptable value of the cosmological constant can be induced by loop corrections [145].\nAll in all, rather than interpreting these statements as condemning various logical options (including dS spacetime in particular) to swampland or worse, they highlight the range and span of applicability of gravitational EFTs. Among them is also then the conjectured conclusion: \u201cdS space does not exist as [a gravitational EFT description of ] a consistent quantum theory of gravity\u201d [125], where we explicitly qualified the quoted statement by inserting (in square brackets) the tacit assumption.\nIndeed, the abundant reports supporting the above-listed conjectures may be seen as corroborating evidence indicating the need to go beyond gravitational EFT modeling, such as adopting a more detailed picture in which the chirally doubled, non-commutative generalizedgeometric formulation of string theory can lead to a positive cosmological constant. Therein,\n12Logically, these \u201cPlanckian units\u201d ought to pertain to the ultimate high-energy regime of string theory, and this oft-cited as 10d Planck energy may well be exponentially lower than its effective 4d value of 1019 GeV; see, e.g., the toy models described in Section 3.\nthe curvature scalar of the dual spacetime is the cosmological constant in the observed spacetime, and the size of the dual space is the gravitational constant in the same observed spacetime. These are lowest-order results [18]. Also, the three scales associated with (a) intrinsic non-commutativity of string theory, (b) the cosmological constant scale and (c) the Planck scale, naturally satisfy a seesaw-like relation by T -duality. We also discuss various implications for dark matter, hierarchy problem as well as a new non-perturbative approach to string theory and quantum gravity. Along the way, we show that these novel features of string theory can be implemented in a particular deformation of cosmic-string like models.\nRegarding the question \u201cwhat physics is responsible for the masses and coupling of elementary particles and their interactions?\u201d an alternative approach that fits the narrative reviewed in this article is the so called \u201cUniverse as an attractor idea\u201d in which the fundamental interactions vertex of string field theory, or the above-mentioned non-perturbative formulation of metastring theory in terms of an abstract, chirally doubled, non-commutative and non-associative matrix quantum theory, introduces an effective \u201chorizontal transfer of information\u201d that has been used in biological physics to argue for the universality of the genetic code [146]. We will address this in the penultimate section of this review."

            "heading": "2.4 A Sorting Survey of Assumptions",
            "text": "It is worth taking a step back, to survey some of the general assumptions that have over the past four decades been built into seeking string vacua that admit a physically realistic interpretation. Foremost, the foregoing discussion relied on considerations of presumed Ansa\u0308tze for the target spacetime structures (topology and geometry), which are complemented by (1) insights and results from the worldsheet (superconformal) quantum field theory point of view (which also incorporate models for which no known target space geometry has yet been identified), and (2) the continually developing network of dualities, mirror symmetry and other relations among the resulting models. Although immensely varied and rich, this palette of possibilities still hides previously unexpected \u201cpockets of possibilities\u201d (see for example [71]), and as we will argue below, a more detailed analysis of the underlying worldsheet level of string theory harbors structural details [83, 84], which have far-reaching consequences that still remain to be explored [18,147,148].\nThe notion of spacetime geometry that is admissible and realizable in string theory has evolved over the past half a century, since [149,150], and has brought about many key models and their variations, as (partially and coarsely) sketched in Figure 1; see also [147]. The evolutionary/family branch 2.(b).ii.D.II (where the de Sitter axilaton models live) may well converge with 3.(e), since the hallmark non-analyticity in the former provides in the latter for the (\u03b4-function like) isolation of dS-like sub-spacetimes. In the 2.(c)-branch, \u201cdiscrepant\u201d13\n13This terminology stems from the technical terms in algebraic geometry, where the smoothing of singularities introduces a discrepancy, a change in the 1st Chern class, i.e., the Ricci tensor (modulo total derivatives).\nmeans that (stringy) Ricci-flatness (anomaly cancellation) is restored by including suitable additional sources, i.e., geometrical/topological defects, C . Also, the 2.(d) branch features foliations, A >B, which are only locally, but not globally, product spaces; this type of geometry will re-emerge below, in the metastring description of spacetime [148,158].\nBacktracking: Inspired by Refs. [159\u2013168], we adopt the Ricci-flatness of the configuration space as a necessary (and possibly sufficient) condition for quantum consistency. The the free loop-space, Ric(LX ), of the stringy spacetime14 X in this original analysis would have to be generalized to include all collective degrees of freedom (branes, defects, etc.) and should also be double-covered to account for left- and right-movers, i.e., loop orientations. The need for this latter modification was foreshadowed by the original computations of vacuum energy by Polchinski, as discussed in \u00a7 4.4; see p. 42, below (4.32). The homotopy and (co)homology of LX is fully determined by the analogous data on X [170, 171], so that\nIndependently, higher-rank curvature and more general geometric characteristics may also change [120]. Furthermore, some of the \u201csource locations\u201d (C ) of such changes were even identified as exo-curves [153\u2013156], whereby the total spacetime becomes a stratified pseudomanifold : A spacetime in this branch may well have lower-dimensional components that connect to the top-dimensional bulk via a yet lower-dimensional intersection; see also the \u201chybrid models\u201d of [157]. 14By \u201cstringy spacetime\u201d we mean a topological space equipped with a metric that may in certain locations degenerate/singularize but in ways that ultimately prove to be innocuous to (super)string dynamics. Such include spacetimes with local finite quotient (orbifold) singularities, conifolds (\u201cA-D-E singularities\u201d), \u201cnormal stratified pseudovarieties\u201d (where strata of different dimensions are connected in real codimension-2 loci, thus featuring external, \u201cexo-branes\u201d first appearing, tacitly in Ref. [155], then explicitly so-identified in Ref. [156]), and possibly worse singular spaces [169]. Without a nonperturbatively complete (super)string theory, this specification must necessarily remain open-ended.\nRic(LX ) = 0 implies R\u00b5\u03bd(X ) = 0 up to total derivatives.15 These statements presume a metric, g\u00b5\u03bd , of Lorentzian signature on X , and of course imply that R(X ) = g\u00b5\u03bdR\u00b5\u03bd(X ) = 0, but this latter (scalar) condition is significantly weaker: (1) the metrics in the 2.(b).ii branches varies non-analytically over spacetime, rendering R\u00b5\u03bd a distribution (with stepfunction, \u03b4-function and other discontinuities and defects), while (2) the 2.(c) branch involves stratified pseudomanifolds, which admit only piece-wise defined metrics. These technical details both help evading various dS no-go theorems (which presume compactness, sufficient differentiability, . . . ), but also render a comprehensive and conclusive analysis much more difficult.\nRicci-flatness is also related to supersymmetry: The topological space(time) X is Ka\u0308hler if it admits a metric g\u00b5\u03bd with Euclidean signature and a complex structure with respect to which g\u00b5\u03bd is Hermitian, everywhere positive definite, so that g\u00b5\u03bd\u0304 = \u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03bd\u0304K for a (Ka\u0308hler) potential K. Then, the existence of a Ricci-flat Ka\u0308hler metric on X implies the existence of the covariantly-constant \u201cholomorphic volume form\u201d (the holomorphic anticanonical bundle, K\u2217X def = det(T (1,0) X )\u2248COX is trivial), which on spin manifolds implies the existence of a covariantly constant spinor, and so the preservation of a globally well-defined supersymmetry. For a priori Lorentzian spacetimes X , one usually presumes to be able to factor (at least in some fibration or foliation sense) a flat R1,d, leaving a nontrivial (9\u2212d)-dimensional factor with a Euclidean metric. The real world is of course not supersymmetric, and we seek more general geometries, which include \u2014 as the generic case \u2014 the irreducible (non-factorizable, non-product) CY5 \u2192 \u201cCY1,9,\u201d with a Lorentzian metric of the dS type (and broken supersymmetry) at least within a well isolated/separated (1, 3)-dimensional subspace.\nFinally, it bears emphasizing that all these and related Ansa\u0308tze presume stringy spacetime (as in Figure 1 and more) to be describable by some EFT in the target space of vev\u2019s of the worldsheet quantum fields \u2014 which in turn have been standardly identified over the past 15 years [13,14]. This is the key assumption, which has been questioned recently [83,84], which we argue lacks sufficient justification, and which opens an avenue for novel insights. This need is in fact indicated by the through studies of \u201cswampland criteria\u201d as we discussed in Section 2.3, and some systemic modification has even been explicitly called for from very different aspects [76, 77,120,144].\nConventional Approach: One seeks to identify a part16 of the target spacetime, X , in superstring models as a candidate for the observed 3+1-dimensional asymptotically de Sitter spacetime, W 3,1dS . This may be (re)organized according to how the various superstring degrees of freedom couple to each other, and in particular to those spanning W 3,1dS and the matter\n15On spacetimes with boundaries or singularities, this requirement is, in general, corrected by contributions localized to those special subspaces; the analogous follows for all other types of topological defects. 16This part may well be a simple subspace of the total spacetime X , a quotient of X , an exceptional subset within X , an external stratum attached to X , . . . and any combination thereof.\nlocalized within it; see Figure 1. In cases where a geometric description is known,17 we may organize this information by assigning the target spacetime a topological space, over which certain structures are defined: In superstring models, supersymmetry is typically associated with a (1) complex structure, at least in some directions of the target spacetime, X . Mirror symmetry, which is closely related to T -duality, implies the analogous relevance of a (2) symplectic structure [172]. The loop-space approach [159\u2013162,164,165] in turn indicates the existence of an overall (3) Ka\u0308hler structure, i.e., choices of (Ricci-flat) Ka\u0308hler metrics, also to be a very general and inherent characteristic \u2014 which is well defined both from the complex-analytic and from the symplectic \u201cside.\u201d Finally, any one of these structures may well fail to extend to certain suitably small subsets (\u201csingularities\u201d) and in suitably \u201cinnocuous\u201d ways. This was first discovered to be the case with \u201corbifold singularities\u201d [173,174], but is a considerably more general feature in string theory [117,134\u2013136,175,176]; see also [133].\n. Rigid product: The simplest of course is flat target spacetime, R1,9: all relevant structures conform to the rigid tensor product of R1-like degrees of freedom; see branch 1. in Figure 1 and Figure 2 (a). The same is true also of various (\u201cstatic\u201d) compactification frameworks, where some global, rigid factor in spacetime is different from Rn, such as the Freund-Rubin [177] or one of the myriads of Calabi-Yau compactification Ansa\u0308tze [10], in branch 2.(a) in Figure 1; for a comprehensive listing see [178\u2013180].\n. Fibration: In \u201cstringy cosmic strings\u201d [79,80], the direct product space is \u201cwarped,\u201d so that the \u201csmall,\u201d compact factor, Y (6), varies over the \u201clarge,\u201d non-compact spacetime W 3,1. This variation may be smooth (as in a vector bundle), or occasionally singular (in various ways and to various degrees); see branches 2.(b) and 2.(c) in Figure 1 and Figure 2 (b), where Y (6) (vertical) may singularize at some special locations of W 3,1 (horizontal). In the latter case, the structures (smoothness, complex, symplectic, Ka\u0308hler, etc.) of the total spacetime may or may not remain continuous or analytic.\n17This pool increases over time, both by introducing genuinely new constructions, but also as many constructions previously deemed \u201cnon-geometric\u201d have since acquired a geometric interpretation, and if by generalizing the notion of geometry itself.\n. Defect: For over two decades by now, a non-analytic dependence of the metric [44,181] has been known to enable novel geometries, as showcased by the axilaton models reviewed in Section 3; see Figure 2 (c). The total spacetime remains a direct product, but non-analyticity (or other structural non-uniformity) in \u201cwarping\u201d singles out some of the instances of one factor, which then is a \u201cdefect\u201d within the total spacetime; see branch 2.(b).ii.D in Figure 1.\n. Exceptional sets: Finally, the various types of algebro-geometric \u201csurgery\u201d (e.g., \u201cblowups\u201d and \u201csmall resolutions\u201d [170]) proffer yet another possibility where the \u201cexceptional sets\u201d are in no way a factor in the total spacetime, but an isolated subset, possibly of key interest and sometimes describable in terms of gravitational instantons [182\u2013184]; see Figure 2 (d). In Figure 1, branches 2.(b,c,d) and 3.(e) all include this. By virtue of exoflops, exceptional (but internal) subsets are also related to connected but external strata of stratified pseudomanifolds [185,186] and \u201chybrid\u201d models [157].\nFeatures such as those outlined in the above (illustrative and by no means exhaustive) listing may well be combined in concrete models: For example, non-analyticity of a structure relevant to stringy spacetime dynamics at certain locations within the spacetime makes them isolated and exceptional. At certain locations, more than one such exception or singularization can occur while remaining admissible to string dynamics.\nThe main point of this very telegraphic and incomplete survey of possible geometries is that judicious combinations of even just some of the features illustrated in Figure 2 easily evade the known \u201cno-go\u201d results about de Sitter spacetime in string theory by invalidating at least one of their assumptions; see [76] for fairly general results indicating this, as well as Section 3 for a show-casing toy example. In particular, direct product geometries (even with warped but not too singular metrics) result in their Ricci curvature tensors (and so also scalars) being additive. This however fails in general, when the spacetime does not factor.18 Even more intricate is the case of \u201cexceptional sets,\u201d which are subspaces that are isolated by some lack of uniformity in some of the relevant structures (complex, symplectic, Ka\u0308hler,. . . ), and so imply exceptional behavior of at least some geodesics in their vicinity. Ultimately for a successful phenomenological application, it suffices for a given stringy model total target spacetime to have but a single 3+1-dimensional de Sitter subset, even if it is some sort of a structural \u201cdefect,\u201d and is sufficiently isolated by any means. That is, the subset of the stringy degrees of freedom spanning the observable Standard Model ought to couple to the rest of stringy degrees of freedom only below current experimental bounds.\nA complete classification and a corresponding precise extent (and loopholes!) of all the various \u201cno-go\u201d results is far from known, but is clearly desirable for a definitive resolution.\n18This is an obvious corollary of the rigorously proven Tian-Yau theorem [187, 188]: Compact complex Fano (R\u00b5\u03bd > 0) varieties are unions of their compact Calabi-Yau (R\u00b5\u03bd = 0) hypersurfaces and their noncompact Calabi-Yau (R\u00b5\u03bd = 0) complements. The simplest example of this is S 2 (of positive curvature), which is the union of a non-compact (Ricci-flat) cylinder, and two points that form the compact (Ricci-flat) 0-fold. The key point is that these are not reducible: in no way do they involve a direct product of spaces.\nAnother point is that the detailed metric structure is important in determining properties such as geodesic (in)completeness, and for various distinct types of geodesics. For example, whereas Wick-rotating to Euclidean geometry can be helpful in certain aspects of analysis as it maps de Sitter spacetime into an ordinary sphere, it also obscures certain key structures such as horizons and other geodesic features.\nThe foregoing repeatedly confirms the notion that the various string theory models are members of a (possibly multiply) connected19 \u201ctheory space,\u201d giving a meaning to the physically relevant distance between them. It then seems reasonable to expect models that admit some form of a de Sitter sub-spacetime (including all options, from a global factor to an isolated, exceptional \u201cbubble,\u201d and however isolated a \u201cstructural defect\u201d) to form a possibly very high codimension (\u201cspecial\u201d) subspace in this stringy theory space, somewhat akin to how conifolds (and their \u201csmall resolutions\u201d) are located within the discriminant locus in the moduli space of Calabi-Yau manifolds. Similarly then, at least some of the stringy models admitting a de Sitter sub-spacetime may well be at finite distance from other (presumably more generic and non-de Sitter) models. To this line of reasoning, the determination of the correct physically relevant metric is of key importance, and has been studied recently: for example, Ref. [191] examines the physical reasons for such distances to diverge. This relates the issue to the \u201cSwampland Distance Conjecture\u201d [103,107,109,110,125,126], its CFT analogue [192,193], and even the quantum information theoretic metric and distance [194\u2013200]. Thus, not only is it relevant to determine if stringy models can admit a de Sitter subspacetime (and if as an isolated \u201cstructural defect,\u201d such as [17, 18, 152] and [71]), but the physical distance of such models from others would indicate if such de Sitter sub-spacetimes can turn up via a phase transition, and whether it can be \u201crolling\u201d or requires tunneling. Such inquiries are clearly a \u201ctall order,\u201d and remain wide open for now.\nLamppost Effect: At heart is the embarras de richesse of string theory, the configuration space of which is transfinitely richer than that in ordinary quantum field theory. Within this abundance, we seek to identify a sector that could approximate the observed asymptotically de Sitter spacetime, W 3,1dS , with the Standard Model of elementary particles and other observed details in it. The historically followed simple-to-complex progression of the explored geometries (left-to-right in Figure 1) is then only reasonable, from a practitioner\u2019s point of view. It is also by no means guaranteed to find a solution."

            "text": "The early discovery that certain singular features in spacetime are important but innocuous to string dynamics [173,174] shows that the choice of available geometries is, in this respect,\n19Since the early results about Calabi-Yau compactification [134\u2013136,189], this notion has been extended over all other stringy models [133], affording even a collective study of certain subsets of this entire ensemble; see for example [190].\nconsiderably more general than in conventional Field Theory. A large class of such singular geometries affords topology change [134, 136, 201, 202], in a milder sense also [185, 203], and so involve some form of a phase transition. This tends to harbor radical effects both in physics and in geometry: massless black holes [204], exoflops [185,186], D-branes [205], and orientifolds [206\u2013208], \u2014 which frequently involve strong coupling regimes.\nModels that are near being singular then invariably involve multiple competing contributions to the effective action, some of which are often hard to estimate. Nevertheless, at least in some cases, suitable approximations have been well argued, as is the case of warped deformations of conifold singularities [209\u2013211]; see also [63, 212, 213]. Here, the deformation of the conifold singularity and the relative size of the \u201cvanishing cycles,\u201d the D3-brane, and the metric warping all affect the target spacetime physics. Detailed examinations of such nearly singular warped direct product compactification scenarios (Figure 2.b) find regimes in which the multiple competing contributions do induce the proper uplift for a metastable de Sitter metric in the non-compact spacetime factor [71, 213]. Taken as casein-point counter-examples to general conjectures [214, 215], these indicate that models with stringy de Sitter spacetime may well be very far from generic, and may well require a highly specialized (\u201cgoldilocks\u201d) syzygy of circumstances and qualities; see also footnote 20 below.\nBy mirror symmetry, the same phenomenon will also occur when the Ka\u0308hler (or symplectic) structure of the model is nearly singular, as is the case with very small relative sizes of the exceptional sets (\u201cO(\u22121,\u22121)-curves\u201d) in a Calabi-Yau 3-fold compactification. Computationally, worldsheet instanton contributions are expected to make the analysis of this \u201cmirror image\u201d more demanding, but one should again expect a detailed balance of various contributing factors as with the nearly singular (complex structure) deformations [71]. In turn however, Calabi-Yau 3-folds are known to generically have very many such exceptional sets (and conifold singularizations) [216], which implies that the pool of such nearly singular models is very numerous, even if requiring highly specialized arrangements.\nThe direct product and the exceptional subset geometries (Figure 2, a\u2013d) may well combine such as in [44, 181], which may be interpreted as two copies of AdS5 glued together non-analytically across a 3-brane-World, W 1,3z=0 [37]; see also [217\u2013219]. The remaining 5 dimensions presumably compactified on a suitable space of positive curvature, such as S5, complete a direct product 10-dimensional spacetime, (AdS5#AdS5)\u00d7S5. This combination of geometries reminds of the axilaton toy model discussed in \u00a7 3, where the \u201ccylinder\u201d W 1,3z=0\u00d7S1 is the non-analytic \u201cinterface\u201d between the \u201cinside,\u201d W 1,3 \u2212 oY 2in , and \u201coutside\u201d\nregion, W 1,3+ oY 2out. Here, the total spacetime is ( (W 1,3\u2212 oY 2in)#(W 1,3 + oY 2out) ) \u00d7K3. In both of these types of models, the metric depends on a local coordinate as |z| near W 1,3z=0, which induces a \u03b4(z)-like singularity in the Ricci tensor. This hallmark non-analyticity of the 9+1- dimensional metric at W 1,3z=0 has been shown to insure both gravity and matter to exhibit properly localized modes at W 1,3z=0, which thereby may serve as a candidate for \u201cour\u201d world. Just as in \u00a7 3 herein, the model of [37] shows the metric within the so embedded W 1,3z=0 to be of the de Sitter type, with the effective, 3+1-dimensional cosmological constant in the\nphenomenologically relevant ballpark.\nIn the model of Ref. [37], W 1,3z=0 emerges as a \u201cbubble,\u201d a domain-wall like interface between a metastable false AdS5 and the nucleated, expanding true AdS5. Such vacuum decay phenomena have been estimated to be generic in string theory [220,221],20 which would then imply the same also for nucleation, a subset of which resulting in de Sitter \u201cbubble\u201dworlds. These phenomena quite explicitly involve phase transitions, which are generally known to be inherently non-perturbative and the description of which is certain to become improved in time. Both in the claimed ubiquity and in this inherently non-perturbative nature, this reminds of the superstring realization [134,136] of \u201cReid\u2019s conjecture\u201d [216], and also of the much more general cobordism connection [133] \u2014 however, with [37] focusing on the dynamically enfolding aftermath of such a phase transition.\nIt behooves us then to give an old whimsy [152] a second look. Overall, string dynamics is generally understood to require the overall target spacetime to be Ricci-flat [159\u2013162, 164, 165]. Its Euclidean Wick-rotation in Type-II theories is by the N = 2 supersymmetry guaranteed to admit both a complex structure and a Ka\u0308hler metric, making it a CalabiYau 5-fold; various dualities should extend this also to other models. Just as Calabi-Yau 3-folds generically contain numerous isolated \u201cO(\u22121,\u22121) curves\u201d [216], Calabi-Yau 5-folds generically contain numerous isolated Fano (R\u00b5\u03bd > 0) compact complex surfaces S [152]. In the Lorentzian original, at least some of these surfaces should acquire a (1, 3)-signature and a de Sitter metric (owing to positive curvature), with \u039bb > 0 parametrizing the relative size of S 7\u2192W 1,3, and very much akin to the de Sitter desingularizing deformation discussed in Section 3.2. Most candidate complex surfaces, S, easily contain real codimension-2 subspaces to serve as I\u00b1 (past and future \u201cinfinity,\u201d see Sections 2.1 and 5) and a natural \u201cflow\u201d between them to serve as an \u201carrow of time\u201d [223, 224]. Being the exceptional sets of \u201csmall resolutions\u201d of conifold singularities the dynamical evolution of the Lorentzian (and so de Sitter) of these 3+1-dimensional subspaces S 7\u2192W 1,3 may well enfold not unlike the de Sitter bubbles of Ref. [37\u201340]."

However, the ultimate\n20Refs. [220,221] in fact conjecture that de Sitter vacua with small cosmological constant generally decay faster than their horizon size; the latter of these two notes the contradiction with the concrete example results of Ref. [222].\npractical goal is of course real-world physics : a Standard-like model of particle physics in a de Sitter-like spacetime \u2014 which is most definitely not supersymmetric.\nThe encountered and highlighted technical difficulties also indicate several assumptions, sometimes tacit, which were pivotal in deducing the non-viability of de Sitter spacetime in string theory models. To summarize, these include, sometimes several of the following, and in various combinations: (1) non-singularity of phenomenologically relevant structures within the full string theory, such as the spacetime; (2) compactness of extra spacetime dimensions; (3) an essentially static approximation to our dynamically evolving universe; (4) reliability and definiteness of the effective, low-energy point-field limit of the full string theory. Some of the attempts in the literature do present exceptions to this, as we discuss below.\nTo showcase a possible avenue in evading these assumptions, we review a particular illustrative discretuum of axion-dilaton (axilaton) toy models [15, 17, 18], which correlates supersymmetry breaking and emergence of a de Sitter sub-spacetime. We focus on the universal subsystem of all superstring models: the combined axion-dilaton field, \u03c4 = \u03b1 + i exp(\u2212\u03c6), familiar from F -theory [225], coupled to gravity. Ignoring all other degrees of freedom permits embedding this analysis within most any superstring model. For simplicity and definiteness however, one may focus on the type IIB string theory. This strategy derives from the original \u201cstringy cosmic strings\u201d [79, 80] and was generalized to a specific type of \u201cstringy cosmic branes\u201d, wherein exponential mass-hierarchy, localized gravity and a realistic cosmological constant all emerge within the same cosmic 3-brane candidate Universe [15,27, 30,147,226].\nTo this end, compactification on a fixed (10\u2212D)-dimensional supersymmetry-preserving space, Y 10\u2212D, reduces the uncompactified \u201clarge\u201d spacetime to D-dimensional, wherein the axion-dilaton field, \u03c4 , varies over a \u201ctransverse\u201d Y 2\u22a5 = (xD\u22122, xD\u22121)-plane. The relevant part of the low-energy effective D-dimensional action for this simple but universal subsystem, coupled to gravity, reads\nSeff = 1\n2\u03ba2\n\u222b dDx \u221a \u2212g(R\u2212 G\u03c4 \u03c4\u0304g\u00b5\u03bd\u2202\u00b5\u03c4\u2202\u03bd \u03c4\u0304 + . . .) .

It is worth noting that these stringy SL(2;Z)-invariant solutions (3.4) are dispersed amongst the analogous SL(2;R)-solutions (of just supergravity) somewhat akin to rational numbers amongst the real numbers. It is tantalizing to then expect at least some of the landscape to be similarly dispersed through (regions of) swampland ; contrast this with [103, Fig. 2].\nThe manifestly non-holomorphic solutions (3.4) are related to their holomorphic analogues, \u03c4I(\u03b8\u2212iz) and \u03c4II(\u03b8\u2212iz) [17], and their corresponding supersymmetric stringy backgrounds.

As R\u00b5\u03bd \u221d T\u0303\u00b5\u03bd(\u03c4, \u03c4\u0304) = diag[0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, 0, 14\u03c9 2`\u22122], the so-sourced spacetimes (3.2a) are Ricci-flat over W 1,3z o Y 2\u22a5 , except along the angular direction in Y 2\u22a5 : The SL(2;Z)-discrete anisotropy, \u03c9 6= 0, of the axilaton field (3.4) \u201cdrives\u201d supersymmetry breaking [27].\nFinally, Friedan\u2019s classic result [24, 25] identifies Einstein\u2019s field equations (3.2a) as the lowest-order condition for the renormalization flow fixed point. Restricting to the 2-dimensional Y 2\u22a5 , the logarithmic nature of the (leading order) Gell-Mann-Low and Green\u2019s functions necessitates the \u201cdimensional transmutation,\u201d whereby the length scale (`, see below) is introduced and set (determined) dynamically \u2014 very much akin to \u039bQCD in strong interactions. This leaves none of the parameters of the toy model continuously variable, and so leaves no room for continuous instability in this sector. A recently considered class of models involving \u201cdefect 7-branes\u201d as companions of the dynamical cobordism of a domain wall [233] exhibit several of the key technical features of the axilaton models \u2014 most prominently, also this logarithmic geometry in Y 2\u22a5 . This then opens the possibility of reverse-engineering an analogous cobordism-related reinterpretation of the axilaton models."

As was shown in [15], close to the putative horizon, z=z0, spacetime is asymptotically flat in agreement with the behavior of Rindler space [236]. Thus, the geometry (3.3) with (3.8) effectively desingularizes [15] the total spacetime of the radically different Minkowski solution [27] with the warp factors:\nA\u0303(z) = Z(z) 1 (D\u22122) and B\u0303(z) = Z(z) \u2212(D\u22123) 2(D\u22122) e2\u03be(1\u2212Z(z) 2)/z0 , when \u039bb=0.

In turn, the de Sitter solution (3.8) keeps the metric (3.3) analytic and real,26 and the cosmological constant, \u039bb > 0, parametrizes this de Sitter desingularization. The location |z|= z0 however does specify a horizon27 and so restricts the physical region.\nThis splits the total spacetime into the \u201cinside\u201d and \u201coutside\u201d regions, respectively: [W 1,3z o Y 2\u22a5 ]z<0 and [W 1,3z o Y 2\u22a5 ]z>0. The interfacing brane-world W 1,3 z=0 is thereby a metric defect, owing to the |z|-dependence of (3.8). There, the Ricci tensor has \u03b4(z)-localized contributions, which require both matter and gravity to be localized at W 1,3z=0 [15, 30]; see Figure 3.

The cosmological constant is thus directly proportional to the anisotropy variance of the axilaton \u03c4 \u2014 and thereby the string coupling constant! This gives a very non-trivial relation between the stringy axilaton field, and hence string theory itself, and a positive \u039bb.

            "text": "In the preceding sections we have reviewed the problem of de Sitter space in string theory. In this section we start from the observation that the problem of de Sitter spacetime in string theory is closely related to the problem of vacuum energy in string theory. Thus the essential question behind finding de Sitter space in string theory is: can string theory solve the vacuum energy problem?\nThe vacuum energy, or the cosmological constant, problem is one of the outstanding fundamental puzzles in physics, as reviewed by Weinberg [99\u2013101] and also Polchinski [9]. This problem has been made even more acute after the discovery of dark energy [1,2]. These famous observations have established the value of the vacuum energy to be \u03c10 \u223c (10\u22123 eV)4, which is somewhere between 50 and 120 orders of magnitude away from the theoretically predicted values, depending on the assumptions made [9, 100,101]; see also [240] for a more detailed estimation.\nIn this section we consider the vacuum energy problem in the context of the metastring approach to quantum gravity (as well as its metaparticle limit), the metastring approach being a duality symmetric and intrinsically non-commutative formulation of string theory. The central result of this section is based on the recent work by Freidel, Kowalski-Glikman, Leigh and Minic [241]. In that paper a UV/IR feedback for the vacuum energy was explored as arising by defining a notion of quantum (modular) space-time vacua. A regularized microscopic count of vacuum states was defined via a process called modular regularization in order to compute the vacuum energy. The calculation of vacuum energy was then tied to a ground state degeneracy. By equating this microscopic ground state degeneracy with macroscopic gravitational entropy (that is, by taking into account holography) a prediction for the vacuum energy was deduced that can easily be consistent with observations. In this procedure the smallness of the vacuum energy was tied to the large size of the Universe. In this section we provide some background to this recent insight and comment of its various physics applications in the context of string theory in de Sitter spacetime.\nOur central point in this section is that the new insight on the vacuum energy problem is naturally offered by an effective doubled and non-commutative structure of quantum spacetime, the habitat for metastrings and metaparticles that was developed in the previous work by Freidel, Kowalski-Glikman, Leigh and Minic [83\u201385, 242\u2013247]. A generically small cosmological constant is realized in string theory via the interplay between the phase space structure of the metastring and the holographic principle of quantum gravity. The same set-up implies a generic seesaw formula between the vacuum energy scale and the Planck scale and it leads to the natural resolution of the hierarchy problem in string theory. We spell out explicitly where the usual reasoning based on effective field theory breaks down in our approach.\nThis section is organized as follows: First, we review Polchinski\u2019s calculation of the vacuum energy for particles and strings. Then, we briefly review the basic concepts associated with metaparticles and metastrings. In Section 4.4 we compute the vacuum energy for metaparticles and metastrings and point out the crucial differences from Polchinski\u2019s seminal calculation from Section 4.2. Then, in Section 4.5 we point out how an interplay of the phase space and modular spacetime properties of the metastring taken together with the holographic nature of low energy gravity in a positive cosmological constant background that is implied by metastring theory, one obtains a naturally small cosmological constant. We also discuss the limit of effective field theory as well as very precise quantization conditions implied by our argument that might have observable consequences. Next we discuss how the usual effective field theory results are recovered and the reasons for the breakdown of effective field theory in the calculation of the cosmological constant and finally, we point out the relation between the cosmological constant problem and the gauge hierarchy problem in the context of metastring theory. We conclude with an inviting question of how to use this new understanding of the string vacuum in order to illuminate the problem of masses of elementary particles."

(4.5)\nAs emphasized by Polchinski, this expression can be understood intuitively: the modulus of the circle S1 is denoted by l, the world line Hamiltonian is 1 2 (p2 +m2), and the 2l factor in the denominator removes the overcounting from translation and reversal of the world line parameter.\nWe will see later that this particle partition function is a particular limit of the analogous expression for the metaparticle partition function given in [85]. Note that ZS1(m 2) diverges as l\u2192 0. By cutting off the integral at short distance and dropping the divergent terms one gets [13] \u222b \u221e\n0\ndl 2l e\u2212(p 2+m2)l/2 \u2192 \u22121 2 log(p2+m2).

(4.9)\nA naive Planckian cutoff gives the huge vacuum energy density 120 orders of magnitude off from the observed one [13, 100]. Invoking supersymmetry after its breaking (in order to fit the observed world) does not help either [13]. In that case, by assuming the supersymmetry breaking scale is set by the effective Higgs scale, one gets 52 orders of magnitude of discrepancy with the observed value.\nThe corresponding computation in string theory resolves the UV divergence, but leaves the IR divergence [13]. We remark that the use of cutoffs in the computation of the cosmological constant in the context of effective field theory has been recently carefully discussed by Donoghue in [249].\nNext we review Polchinski\u2019s string theory computation, which generalizes his particle computation of the vacuum energy density. Polchinski takes the point particle result and generalizes as follows [13]:\nZS1(m 2) def = iVD \u222b \u221e 0 dl 2l (2\u03c0l)\u2212D/2 e\u2212m 2l/2 = VD \u222b dDp (2\u03c0)D \u222b \u221e 0 dl 2l e\u2212(p 2+m2)l/2 (4.10)\nwhere mass m2 is given in string theory as\nm2 = 2\n\u03b1\u2032 (h+ h\u0303\u2212 2) (4.11)\nand where the levels are matched h = h\u0303 as\n\u03b4h,h\u0303 = \u222b \u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 d\u03b8 2\u03c0 ei(h\u2212h\u0303)\u03b8. (4.12)\nThus Polchinski obtains the string analogue of the point particle result (the string partition function on the torus) after summing over all physical states (labeled by i)\u2211 i ZS1(m 2 i ) = iVD \u222b \u221e 0 dl 2l \u222b \u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 d\u03b8 2\u03c0 (2\u03c0l)\u2212D/2 \u2211 i e\u2212i(hi+h\u0303i\u22122)+i(hi\u2212h\u0303i)\u03b8.

In the context of the string partition function on the torus, ZT 2 , which has the same expression as the above formula for Zstring, the fundamental region of integration is\nF : |\u03c4 | > 1, |\u03c41| < 1\n2 (4.17)\nand in the string case the UV divergent region is absent. Thus the string answer is UV finite (but there is still an IR divergence due to the tachyon of the bosonic string).\nHowever, as Polchinski points out, even though the string answer is UV finite, the string vacuum energy density still scales as in the particle case \u03c1string \u223c \u039bD, which can be seen by looking explicitly at the momentum integral in the partition function Zstring.\nThe main message here is that the vacuum energy problem persists in string theory (as a natural extrapolation of the vacuum energy problem in particle physics/effective quantum field theory). Thus, a new insight into the vacuum energy problem is needed. Therefore, we turn to the concept of metaparticles, metastrings and modular spacetime, and then we repeat Polchinski computation in that context in order to resolve the vacuum energy problem."

            "text": "Here we give a short background on metaparticles [85, 250] followed by a brief discussion of metastrings and modular spacetime and the underlying physics behind these concepts. The idea of metaparticles (the zero modes of the metastring) is implied by the generic quantum spacetime formulation of quantum theory and its associated geometry described in [245]. In [245], Freidel, Leigh and Minic have argued that any quantum theory is endowed with a generic quantum polarization associated with a new concept of quantum spacetime that we call modular spacetime [244]. Essentially, if one considers a complete basis of unitary observables on a latticized spacetime, one has to consider the dual lattice as well. According to the modular spacetime formulation of quantum theory, quite generically, quantum theory can be formulated using a quantum spacetime, which can be very roughly understood as a covariant quantum superposition of the spacetime and its dual. More precisely, modular spacetime is given by a selfdual lattice of (covariant) phase space lifted to the non-commutative, Heisenberg-Weyl algebra [251], or even more mathematically, the modular spacetime describes the space of all commuting subalgebras of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra. (This is based on the famous theorem of Mackey [252] regarding the geometry of all commutative subalgebras of the Heisenberg algebras. The commutative nature of modular variables of Aharonov [253] is responsible for the name \u201cmodular spacetime\u201d.) This quantum, modular spacetime polarization manifestly realizes quantum non-locality, associated with quantum superposition principle, and is consistent with relativistic causality. It also resolves an apparent contradiction between non-locality (fundamental length and time) and relativistic covariance. This generic modular polarization comes equipped with a new geometric structure called Born geometry [242, 243]. Born geometry unifies symplectic, orthogonal and conformal geometries and is found to be fundamental in a new formulation of quantum gravity in the guise of string theory, called metastring theory [83], reviewed briefly in what follows. Metastring theory lives in modular spacetime and it represents an intrinsically non-commutative, chiral phase space-like, and T -duality covariant formulation of string theory [83, 84, 246, 247]. The zero modes of the metastring define a new concept, called metaparticle, that explicitly realizes the geometry of modular spacetime [85], and that could be considered as a prediction of the modular representation of quantum theory. The\ntheory of metaparticles can be also understood as a particle model for Born geometry of modular spacetime [242,243].\nThe series of papers [83\u201385, 242\u2013247] (for reviews consult [254, 255]) offer a view on quantum gravity in terms of \u201cgravitization of the quantum\u201d. More precisely, quantum gravity is defined as a theory of a dynamical Born geometry, as realized in metastring theory. (A mathematical elaboration of Born geometry can be found in [91]). This development can be understood as a concrete implementation of the physical concept of Born reciprocity (the fundamental reciprocity between spacetime and energy-momentum space) [256\u2013258] as well as the new idea of relative (or observer dependent) locality [259, 260]. Thus, the path from quantum theory to quantum theory of gravity is closely analogous to the familiar path that leads from the physical and geometric underpinnings of special relativity to the general theory of relativity. Metaparticles could be considered as a generic prediction of this new view on the problem of quantum gravity. As we will discuss in the penultimate section of this paper, each observed (canonical) particle should have a dual particle, and such dual particles appear as good candidates for dark matter [254, 255] that is correlated to the observed, visible matter [261\u2013263]. Also, this approach predicts a dual gravity sector (associated with a dynamical dual spacetime) [254, 255], which can be used to model dark energy as a cosmological constant in the observed spacetime [18, 264]. We will discuss this later as well.\nIt will be sufficient for our purposes to consider free metaparticles, whose dynamics are given by a world-line action involving a doubling of the usual phase space coordinates. The action is of the form [85,246,247]\nSmp def = \u222b 1 0 d\u03c4 [ p \u00b7 x\u0307+ p\u0303 \u00b7 \u02d9\u0303x+ \u03b1\u2032 p \u00b7 \u02d9\u0303p+ 1 2 N ( p2 + p\u03032 + m2 ) + N\u0303 (p \u00b7 p\u0303 \u2212 \u00b5) ] . (4.18)\nHere the signature is (\u2212,+, . . . ,+) and the contraction of indices is denoted by \u201c\u00b7\u201d. At the classical level, the theory has world-line reparametrization invariance and two additional features [85]. The first new feature of the model is the presence of an additional local symmetry, which from the string point of view corresponds to the completion of worldsheet diffeomorphism invariance. From the particle world-line point of view, this symmetry is associated with an additional local constraint. The second new feature is the presence of a non-trivial symplectic form on the metaparticle phase space, the non-zero brackets being\n{p\u00b5, x\u03bd} = \u03b4\u03bd\u00b5, {p\u0303\u00b5, x\u0303\u03bd} = \u03b4\u03bd\u00b5, {x\u0303\u00b5, x\u03bd} = \u03c0\u03b1\u2032\u03b4\u03bd\u00b5. (4.19)\nwith \u00b5, \u03bd = 0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, d\u22121. Because of its interpretation as a particle model on Born geometry, associated with the modular representation of quantum theory, the space-time on which the metaparticle propagates is ambiguous, with different choices related by what in string theory we would call T -duality. The attractive features of this model include world-line causality and unitarity, as well as an explicit mixing of widely separated energy-momentum scales.\nThe metaparticle propagator follows from the world-line path integral involving the above\naction and has the following form [85]: G(p, p\u0303; pi, p\u0303i) \u223c \u03b4(d)(p\u2212pi)\u03b4(d)(p\u0303\u2212p\u0303i) \u03b4(p\u00b7p\u0303\u2212\u00b5) p2+p\u03032+m2\u2212i\u03b5 . 31 Although we will not consider metaparticle interactions directly in this paper, such interactions preserve both p and p\u0303. We see that although p, p\u0303 might resemble a doubling of momentum space, the propagator contains a simple pole along with a \u03b4-function constraint. We note that the usual string spectrum on flat space-time corresponds to the rather singular limit (actually a super-selection sector) in which all states have \u00b5 = 0 and p\u0303 = 0; flat compactifications correspond to including states with non-zero p\u0303, at least along space-like directions.\nIt follows from the metaparticle action that the metaparticle kinematics is defined by two\nconstraints\nH def= p2 + p\u03032 + m2 = 0, (4.20)\nD def= p \u00b7 p\u0303 \u2212 \u00b5 = 0. (4.21)\nThese constraints together are invariant underO(1, d\u22121)1nO(1, d\u22121)2. The groupO(1, d\u22121)1 acts as (p\u0303, p) 7\u2192 (\u039bp\u0303, p\u039b\u22121), and so can be identified with the usual Lorentz symmetry; p2, p\u03032 and p \u00b7 p\u0303 are all O(1, d \u2212 1)1-invariants; two combinations of these are fixed by the constraints, while \u03b4 = 1\n2 (p\u03032 \u2212 p2) is not, and this is not an invariant of O(1, d\u22121)2. Thus, we\ncan interpret the states as elements of an orbit of O(1, d\u22121)2, with \u2212p2 = m2 = \u03b4+ 12m 2. In addition, for each state, p\u0303 is constrained by (4.21). Depending on the values of \u00b5,m2, \u03b4 will occupy a certain range of allowed values, and for physical reasons we will need to restrict those values. Thus we can think of a metaparticle state as being labeled by momentum p and \u201cinternal\u201d quantum numbers p\u0303 which transform under Lorentz. This might seem to be in conflict with the Coleman-Mandula theorem [265]; however, within the sector of fixed non-zero p\u0303, O(1, d\u22121)2 is effectively spontaneously broken. Here the novel feature is that the internal symmetry is non-compact, and we should consider separately the cases in which p\u03032 is time-like, light-like and space-like [250].\nAlso, given the fact that the \u00b5 = 0 superselection sector belongs to usual particles, the metaparticle extension (\u00b5 6= 0) should be explored in connection with phenomenology of dark matter.32 Thus the usual detection analysis of particulate dark matter should be revisited in the context of metaparticle kinematics and representation theory. We emphasize that the value of \u00b5 differs for different particles.\nWe remark that there exists an interesting observation concerning the metaparticle dispersion relation in a cosmological context [250]. In curved spacetime with metric g we have\n31One can also deduce the corresponding scalar potential from this propagator, which is of the Friedel\nform e \u2212\u03b1r\nr\u03b2 cos(\u03b3r), where \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are functions of m,\u00b5, d (unpublished work of Freidel, Kowalski-Glikman,\nLeigh and Minic). 32We also note the similarity between our new parameter p\u0303 and the continuous spin representations of the canonical Poincare group [266].\n(as a metaparticle limit [85] of the general Hamiltonian constraint for the metastring [83,84])\ng\u00b5\u03bd p\u00b5p\u03bd + g\u00b5\u03bd p\u0303 \u00b5p\u0303\u03bd = \u2212m2 (4.22)\nNow, in the case of a cosmological background (such as the space with a positive cosmological constant \u2014 asymptotic de Sitter space \u2014 including its excitations, such as black holes)\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + a2dx2 (4.23)\nwe can deduce [250] that in the early (small) universe the dual (\u201cdark\u201d) degrees of freedom dominate, and that in the old (large) universe the visible degrees of freedom are dominant. Also, we can go to a frame in which the dual 3-momenta are frozen ~\u0303p = 0, and thus EE\u0303 = \u00b5, leading to an effective IR deformation of the standard dispersion relation for a scalar particle E2 + \u00b52/E2 = ~p 2 +m2, which could be experimentally tested. The relation EE\u0303 = \u00b5 will be important in our discussion of vacuum energy in the following sections.\nNow we give a very brief review of metastrings with emphasis on the phase space (noncommutative) structure and extensification of spacetime. As already stated, metaparticles are zero modes of the metastring. Metastring theory [83\u201385, 242\u2013247, 254] can be thought of as a formulation of string theory in which the target space is doubled in such a way that T -duality acts linearly on the coordinates. This doubling means that momentum and winding modes appear on an equal footing. We refer to the target space as a phase space since the metastring action requires the presence of a background symplectic form \u03c9. The metastring formulation also requires the presence of geometrical structures that generalize to phase space the spacetime metric and the B-field (where the B-field originates from the symplectic structure \u03c9). In fact, in the metastring we have not one but two notions of a metric. The first metric \u03b7 is a neutral metric that defines a bi-Lagrangian structure and allows to define the classical spacetime as a Lagrangian sub-manifold33 \u2014 more precisely, the classical spacetime is defined as a null subspace for \u03b7 which is also Lagrangian for \u03c9. The second metric H is a metric of signature (2, 2(D\u22121)) that encodes the geometry along the classical spacetime (of dimension D) as well as the transverse energy-momentum space geometry. In this formulation, T -duality exchanges the Lagrangian sub-manifold with its image under J = \u03b7\u22121H. Classical metastring theory is defined by the following action [83] which realizes the above comments about quantum field theory in the modular polarization for the special case of a two-dimensional world-sheet quantum field theory34\nSchstr = 1\n4\u03c0 \u222b \u03a3 d2\u03c3 [ \u2202\u03c4XA ( \u03b7AB(X) + \u03c9AB(X) ) \u2212 \u2202\u03c3XAHAB(X) ] \u2202\u03c3XB, (4.24)\nwhere XA def= (xa/\u03bb, x\u0303a/\u03bb)T (with \u03b1\u2032 = \u03bb2 and a = 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, D\u22121) are dimensionless coordinates on phase-space like (doubled) target spacetime and the fields \u03b7,H, \u03c9 are all dynamical (i.e.,\n33We remind the reader that in symplectic geometry, a Lagrangian subspace is a half-dimensional submanifold upon which the symplectic form pulls back to zero. In more familiar terms, a Lagrangian submanifold might be the subspace coordinatized by the q\u2019s within the phase space coordinatized by q\u2019s and p\u2019s. 34See also [90] and the double field formalism [267].\ngenerally X-dependent) target spacetime fields. In the context of a flat metastring we have constant \u03b7AB, HAB and \u03c9AB\n\u03b7AB def =\n( 0 \u03b4\n\u03b4T 0\n) , HAB def = ( h 0\n0 h\u22121\n) , \u03c9AB = ( 0 \u03b4\n\u2212\u03b4T 0\n) , (4.25)\nwhere \u03b4\u00b5\u03bd is the d-dimensional identity matrix and h\u00b5\u03bd is the d-dimensional Lorentzian metric, T denoting transpose. The Hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints of the metastring read as follows:\nH = HAB \u2202\u03c3XA\u2202\u03c3XA, D = \u03b7AB \u2202\u03c3XA\u2202\u03c3XA (4.26)\nThese constraints reduce to the Hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints for the metaparticles. In the standard string notation the metaparticle parameters m2 and \u00b5 become \u03b1\u2032m2 = N + N\u0303 \u2212 2 and \u03b1\u2032\u00b5 = N \u2212 N\u0303 . Note the fundamental non-commutativity of the metastring [246,247]:\n[XA(\u03c3),XB(\u03c3\u2032)] = 2i\u03bb2 [ \u03c0\u03c9AB \u2212 \u03b7AB\u03b8(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3\u2032) ] , (4.27)\nwhere \u03b8(\u03c3) is the staircase distribution, i.e., a solution of \u03b8\u2032(\u03c3) = 2\u03c0\u03b4(\u03c3); it is odd and quasiperiodic with period 2\u03c0. This intrinsic non-commutativity is tied to the fact that the algebra of vertex operators does not contain any cocycles, and that vertex operators are found as representations of the above Heisenberg-Weyl algebra. We remark that upon setting of the symplectic background to zero, and the integration of the dual variables, one recovers the familiar Polyakov action for the bosonic string propagating in a background spacetime. The critical dimension of the metastring is still the critical central change c (\u201ccritical spacetime dimensions\u201d) of the bosonic string, that is, c = 26.\nFinally, a brief note on the habitat of metastring theory [83\u201385,242\u2013247,254], the modular spacetime and its extensification: The space of all commuting subalgebras of the HeisenbergWeyl algebra defines the modular space. The modular space can be understood as a self-dual lattice of phase space lifted to the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra. It is equipped with what we call Born geometry: the symplectic geometry of phase space, the doubly orthogonal geometry associated with the self-dual lattice of phase space, and the doubly metric geometry associated with the choice of vacuum in this modular formulation of quantum theory,\u2019 in terms of modular variables (originally suggested by Aharonov and collaborators in the context of quantum foundations [253]). These are precisely the backgrounds of the above action for the metastring. Note that the metastring propagates in modular spacetime. Note also that the bosonic metastring does not have the tachyon interpretation for the leading vertex operator describing the plane waves in the above chiral phase space formulation of the metastring (the tachyon interpretation is essentially tied to the classical spacetime interpretation of the string target space). The basic \u201catoms\u201d of modular spacetime are the fully \u201ccompactified\u201d 25 + 1 dimensional bosonic string. Because of the modular interpretation there are no issues with closed time-like loops in this context. One builds spacetime backgrounds out of these atomic building blocks in the process called extensification, described in [245]. From this point of\nview, one starts from zero dimensions and builds upwards to 4 spacetime dimensions (the 10 dimensional superstring being a very particular, and not a generic extensification). We will use the modular spacetime nature of the metastring background as well as the concept of extensification in our argument regarding the metastring resolution of the cosmological constant problem in what follows.\nWhat happens if we \u201cextensify\u201d the modular cell, which is of unit Planckian area, into a cell of area N in Planck units [245]? We may consider changing the lattice in different ways that change the size of its fundamental cell. This is a non-trivial process, as it changes the structure of the theory, and in particular modifies the Hilbert space. More precisely, while a change of the lattice shape L\u2192 L\u2032 that does not modify its size can be implemented unitarily, a change that modifies its size leads to inequivalent Hilbert spaces HL and HL\u2032 .\nWe stress that there are really two ways in which we can extend the cell [245]: either we extensify modular space along the space directions or the dual space directions. We also distinguish between the operation of extensification which makes the size of space bigger than the size of dual space, while the second (called \u201ccoarsening operation\u201d) increases the size of the cell homogeneously in both directions (space and dual space). We can extend the lattice by keeping the fundamental scales (the fundamental size of space and the fundamental size of dual space) fixed, or we can keep the lattice fixed while rescaling the fundamental scale of space but keeping the fundamental size of dual space fixed. The coarsening limit corresponds to a rescaling of both the fundamental scale of space and the fundamental scale of dual space. From this perspective both extensification and coarsening correspond to expanding towards a larger phase space cell. What distinguishes the two procedures is that during extensification we change the shape of the cell, which is elongated along the space direction, while during coarsening, we do not.\nFinally, each phase cell has one unit of flux. For multiflux states, we can distribute the fluxes along the phase cells of the extensified space. First we can map the extensified cell with one flux into the unit cell with many fluxes, where the Hilbert space of an extensified cell with a unit flux is embedded onto the Hilbert space of a unit cell with many fluxes. We can also embed the unit cell with many fluxes into many unit cells each with a unit flux, which amounts to an embedding of a Hilbert space of the unit cell with many fluxes to a tensor product of Hilbert spaces of unit cells with unit flux, in a coherent fashion.\nThus, modular space has properties which are far more intricate than those of the usual classical space. There exists a possibility of realizing states associated with larger space as multi-flux states. These identifications in principle blur the line between what is pure geometry and what can be considered as matter. This unification of matter and geometry contained in modular space is one of the most fascinating aspects of the construction presented in [245]."

            "text": "We now comment on the metaparticle and metastring analogues of Polchinski\u2019s calculation.\nAs explained in the original paper [85] we confine our attention to the x, p\u0303 polarization, because of the commutative nature of this pair of variables, which in the quantum theory means that we are considering a specific set of transition amplitudes. (Here we redefine N 2 def = e and N\u0303 def = e\u0303 in order to match the notation from our original paper [85].) Since we have two constraints, the quantum states will be further labelled by a pair of evolution parameters, which we call `, \u02dc\u0300. The transition amplitude in the x, p\u0303 polarization has a canonical interpretation\nK(xf , p\u0303f , `f , \u02dc\u0300f ;xi, p\u0303i, `i, \u02dc\u0300i) = \u3008xf , p\u0303f ; `f , \u02dc\u0300f |xi, p\u0303i; `i, \u02dc\u0300i\u3009\n= \u3008xf , p\u0303f |e\u2212i(`f\u2212`i)H\u0302\u2212i( \u02dc\u0300 f\u2212\u02dc\u0300i)D\u0302|xi, p\u0303i\u3009.\n(4.28)\nAs we will see later in more detail, causality imposes that ` = `f \u2212 `i > 0 while we will not restrict the sign of \u02dc\u0300 = \u02dc\u0300f \u2212 \u02dc\u0300i. The relativistic propagator, denoted G, is obtained by integratingK over ` and \u02dc\u0300. This comes about when we introduce a parameter \u03c4 parametrizing the world-line and express the Hamiltonian parameters in terms of the frame fields (e, e\u0303)\n` = \u222b C |e|(\u03c4), \u02dc\u0300= \u222b C e\u0303(\u03c4). (4.29)\nwhere C : \u03c4 \u2192 (x, x\u0303, p, p\u0303, e, e\u0303)(\u03c4) is a path in phase space, with boundary conditions (x, p\u0303)(\u03c4i) = (xi, p\u0303i) and (x, p\u0303)(\u03c4f ) = (xf , p\u0303f ), and the modulus on e follows from the causality requirement, as explained in detail in [85].\nAs in the usual derivation of the particle path integral, we use factorization repeatedly to find a continuum expression for G. Allowing for arbitrary parametrizations of the world-line yields the integration over e and e\u0303, as is explained in detail in Appendix A of [85]. This in turn means that the propagator G is obtained by integrating over all Lagrange parameters and is independent of the coordinate times \u03c4i, \u03c4f . Thus we find\nG(xf , p\u0303f ;xi, p\u0303i) =\n\u222b [de de\u0303] \u222b xf ,p\u0303f xi,p\u0303i [ddx ddp\u0303] \u222b [ddp ddx\u0303] ei \u222b C(p\u00b7dx\u2212x\u0303\u00b7dp\u0303+\u03c0\u03b1 \u2032p\u00b7dp\u0303\u2212|e|H\u2212e\u0303D), (4.30)\nThe derivation of this path integral proceeds without incident because the operators x\u0302, \u02c6\u0303p commute. Computing it, we find after gauge fixing, that the propagator in x, p\u0303 space is\nG(xf , p\u0303;xi, p\u0303i) \u223c \u03b4(d)(p\u0303 \u2212 p\u0303i) \u222b ddp\n(2\u03c0)d\n\u222b d` d\u02dc\u0300 e\u2212i`H\u2212i \u02dc\u0300D eip\u00b7(xf\u2212xi), (4.31)\nIntegrating over ` \u2208 (0,\u221e) and \u02dc\u0300\u2208 (\u2212\u221e,\u221e) then yields the metaparticle propagator\nG(x, p\u0303; 0, p\u0303i) \u223c \u03b4(d)(p\u0303 \u2212 p\u0303i) \u222b ddp\n(2\u03c0)d eip\u00b7x p2 + p\u03032 +m2 \u2212 i\u03b5 \u03b4(p \u00b7 p\u0303 \u2212 \u00b5). (4.32)\nThere are two differences compared to an ordinary relativistic particle propagator: One is the \u03b4-function of the D constraint, and the other is the presence of p\u0303 in the denominator. We note that the propagator is invariant under the change \u00b5 \u2192 \u2212\u00b5, if we simultaneously change p\u0303 \u2192 \u2212p\u0303. Consequently, we will without loss of generality assume that \u00b5 > 0.\nWe have been cavalier about the dl and dl\u0303 measures. In order to understand that question\nlet us recall how Polyakov derives the dl 2l term in the measure for the ordinary particle [268] (also found in Polchinski\u2019s calculation). For a circular path, one has the translation symmetry \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 + a and this must be excluded from the measure. This is obvious from the action for the ordinary particle. Polyakov implements this symmetry via the following relation\u222b l\n0 da \u222b l 0 d\u03c4 l \u03b4(f(\u03c4) \u2212 a) = 1. So, Polyakov ends up with the measure dl l which is Polchinski\u2019s\nanswer as well dl 2l , up to a factor of 2 which really takes into account the reverse paths. (This is essentially the Faddeev-Popov procedure.) A different justification for this measure was given in Green, Schwarz and Witten, where the above expression for the one loop partition function and the vacuum energy was given from the field theory point of view, and the measure results from the regularization of the Schwinger parametrization of that field theoretic expression for vacuum energy [11,12].\nThe metaparticle can be viewed as a rigid string, that is a string without string oscillators (just zero modes). The measure for metaparticle should thus be the same one as the measure of the torus for the one loop partition function of the string that we reviewed following Polchinski. In order to do that we need to rescale the dimensionful l\u0303 by the size of the string ls (or equivalently, \u03b1 \u2032 = l2s). Let us call l\u0303/ls def = \u03b8. Then the correct measure for the metaparticle Schwinger parameters is the torus measure of the string (with the additional modular invariance requirements which lead to the fundamental domain of integration as in Polchinski\u2019s calculation).\nThus, in order to evaluate the metaparticle vacuum energy density we set x = 0 and p\u0303i = 0 in the above formula for the metaparticle propagator and use the Schwinger parametrization of the metaparticle propagator in order to get the following expression as the correct analogue of Polchinski\u2019s result for the vacuum energy density (the above expression for ZS1(m 2) divided by the spacetime volume factor, VD, as well as, in our case, the volume of the dual spacetime)\nVp\u0303 Zmp(m 2, \u00b5) = (\u222b \u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 d\u03b8 2\u03c0 ei(p\u00b7p\u0303\u2212\u00b5)l 2 s\u03b8/2 )\u222b dDp\u0303 dDp (2\u03c0)2D \u222b \u221e 0 dl 2l ei(p 2+p\u03032+m2)l/2. (4.33)\nNote that this expression has to be divided by the volume Vp\u0303 of the p\u0303 space in order to give the correct units for the vacuum energy density. Unlike Polchinski\u2019s formula it is a Lorentzian expression, and it reduces to Polchinski\u2019s in the singular limit \u00b5\u2192 0, p\u0303 \u2192 0.\nGiven the homogeneity of the measure over the metaparticle Schwinger parameters the above expression for the metaparticle one loop partition function (divided by the volume Vp\u0303 of the p\u0303 space, in order to get the correct units for the vacuum energy density) becomes\n(here we only concentrate on the scaling with the momentum space volume)\nZmp(m 2, \u00b5) = aD\n\u222b dDp\n(2\u03c0)D , (4.34)\nwhere aD is a factor that does not depend on the momentum scale in D spacetime dimensions. (For simplicity we will omit the dependence on m2.) Let the cutoffs in the p and p\u0303 spaces be denoted by \u039b and \u039b\u0303. The cutoffs \u039b and \u039b\u0303 are naturally implied by the fundamental non-commutativity of the metaparticle. (In what follows we will use the diffeomorphism constraint in order to emphasize the possible relation between the cosmological constant problem and the gauge hierarchy problem, to be discussed at the end of this section. We will also connect to the seesaw formulae derived in our toy model from Section 3.) Then, first, we have from the diffeomorphism constraint that, in principle\n\u039b\u039b\u0303 = \u00b5vac (4.35)\nand second, that\nZmp(m 2, \u00b5) = aD\n\u222b dDp\n(2\u03c0)D = aD\u039b\nD = aD (\u00b5vac \u039b\u0303 )D . (4.36)\nHere \u00b5vac denotes the vacuum energy \u00b5 parameter. (Note the \u00b5 parameters are different for different particles, and different physical situations.) This seesaw formula is natural in the sense of \u2019t Hooft because the increase of the \u039b\u0303 leads to the lowering of the vacuum energy.\nGiven the intrinsic non-commutativity of the metaparticle, the spacetime polarization is not fixed. Still one can pick a particular, \u201cchiral\u201d spacetime polarization in the above \u201cdoubled\u201d formulation. In particular, we could have picked the dual, x\u0303, p polarization, because of the commutativity of that pair of variables. Then we would have obtained by replacing p by p\u0303\nZmp(m 2, \u00b5) = aD (\u00b5vac \u039b )D . (4.37)\nThus, in either case we get the following \u201cseesaw\u201d formula for the observed vacuum energy density \u03c10 which incorporates the fundamental UV/IR relation of the metaparticle\n\u03c10 = aD (\u00b5vac \u039b\u0303 )D (4.38)\nwhich is what is apparently observed if \u00b5vac is the TeV 2 scale, \u039b\u0303 is the Planck scale, and D= 4.\nThe main point here is that the big spacetime is balanced by a Planckian dual spacetime, and vice versa. This fits the picture advertised in [250]. And that is the first important point regarding the cosmological constant problem. The metastring should make the whole calculation both UV and IR finite; see below. In the following subsections we will explain\nthe justification for the use of the Planck scale for \u039b\u0303 and the TeV scale for \u00b5vac (the vacuum scale associated with the Higgs part of the matter sector.)\nBefore doing that, we note that the metastring analogue of Polchinski\u2019s expression for the canonical string written as an infinite sum of particle excitations is (after writing m2 = 2 \u03b1\u2032\n(NL + NR \u2212 2) and \u00b5 = 2\u03b1\u2032 (NL \u2212 NR), where NL and NR denote left and right string oscillators) after summing over all oscillators\nVp\u0303 \u2211 L,R Zmp(m 2, \u00b5) def = Vp\u0303 Zms (4.39)\nso that we get\nVp\u0303 Zms = \u2211 L,R (\u222b \u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 d\u03b8 2\u03c0 ei[p\u00b7p\u0303\u2212(NL\u2212NR)]l 2 s\u03b8/2 )\u222b dDp\u0303 dDp (2\u03c0)2D \u222b \u221e 0 dl 2l ei[p 2+p\u03032+(NL+NR)]l/2. (4.40)\nThis expression should in principle demonstrate an explicit relation between the UV and IR finite behavior of the metastring, which is expected on general grounds in metastring theory (as opposed to the UV finite and IR divergent behavior of the canonical string). We will comment on this issue in what follows.\nOn the other hand, we have once again\nZms = bD\n\u222b dDp\n(2\u03c0)D = bD\u039b\nD = bD (\u00b5vac \u039b )D , (4.41)\nwhere bD is another purely numerical factor in D spacetime dimensions. Therefore the metastring vacuum energy scales as\n\u03c1ms = bD\u039b D = bD (\u00b5vac \u039b\u0303 )D . (4.42)\nThis seesaw behavior (again technically natural in the sense of \u2019t Hooft) comes about explicitly from the momentum integral in the partition function Zms, as in the case of metaparticles. Note that both the metastring vacuum energy is UV finite as in the case of Polchinski\u2019s original computation in bosonic string theory.\nWe expect that the metastring should resolve the IR divergence that is due to the tachyon of the canonical bosonic string. The metastring should display a self-dual fixed point and the UV/IR correspondence, and thus UV finiteness should imply IR finiteness, and thus the absence of the tachyon, as stated in the original papers on metastrings and modular spacetime [83, 84, 242\u2013247]. In what follows we concentrate on the cosmological constant problem."

            "heading": "4.5 The Cosmological Constant Problem",
            "text": "Given these results we now come to our main point: the above vacuum energy of the metastring can be naturally small thus clarifying the cosmological constant problem. This is the central result of the recent work by Freidel, Kowalski-Glikman, Leigh and Minic [241]. As already emphasized, in that paper a UV/IR feedback for the vacuum energy was explored as arising by defining a notion of quantum (modular) space-time vacua, and a regularized microscopic count of vacuum states was defined via a process that called modular regularization and that was used to compute the vacuum energy. The calculation of vacuum energy was then tied to a ground state degeneracy and by equating this microscopic ground state degeneracy with macroscopic gravitational entropy, or holography, a prediction for the vacuum energy was obtained that was consistent with observations. Also, the concept of contextuality (one of the hallmarks of quantum theory) emerged as a central guiding idea \u2014 as opposed to statistical, anthropic, reasoning [9, 99].\nIn what follows we will not repeat this argument, but we will emphasize its essential features in the context of metastring theory. The reason for the clarification of the cosmological constant problem in this context involves a combination of the modular spacetime background nature of the metastring, the phase space properties of the metastring, and the holographic bound on the number of degrees of freedom of any quantum theory of gravity, including the metastring.\nFirst: The metastring lives in modular spacetime (as explained in \u00a7 4.3). In that context one builds a spacetime background out of modular spacetime \u201cblocks\u201d which are of the Planck size lP . (In general, the fundamental scale is the string scale \u03bb, that we take to be of the order of the Planck scale lP .) This procedure, named extensification, should be contrasted to the usual compactification procedure.\nNow we imagine that one has 4 spacetime dimensions extensified and all the other dimensions of the order of the Planck scale (or string scale). Similarly for the dual directions. In the energy momentum space we also extensify 4 energy momentum dimensions (conjugate to the extensified spacetime dimensions). The dual momenta \u039b\u0303 are also assumed to be of the Planck size.\nOne might ask: why 4 spacetime dimensions? The natural answer is that cosmologically, as the spacetime extensifies from the Planck phase, the string (having a 2 dimensional worldsheet) becomes \u201ccritical\u201d in 4 dimensions (\u201c2+2 = 4\u201d) as suggested long ago by Brandenberger and Vafa in their paper on string gas cosmology [269] (which also agrees with our recent work [250]).\nSecond: Given this setup, we have the following very simple but profound formula (that is not true in effective field theory). The phase space volume of the combined 4d extensified spacetime and 4d extensified energy-momentum space is given the number of degrees of freedom N . Let l denote the length of the extensified spacetime dimension and \u039b the length\nof the extensified energy momentum space dimension. Then (without paying attention to the numerical factor, which we denote by c4, in 4 spacetime dimensions, in order to make the main point as clearly as possible) we have that\u222b d4x \u222b d4p = c4 l 4\u039b4 = N. (4.43)\nEssentially, this relation represents a UV/IR mixing, but of a very precise kind. Note that this UV/IR mixing is not possible in effective field theory. Given the fact that our theory (metastrings) contains gravity, we know that the cosmological constant as defined by Einstein\u2019s equations (that also follow from the conformal invariance of the metastring) is given in terms of the vacuum energy density \u03c1 (as discussed precisely in the previous section for the case of the metastring, that is scaling as \u039b4 in 4 spacetime dimensions) and the Newton constant GN = l 2 P\n\u03bbcc = 8\u03c0\u03c1 l 2 P = 8\u03c0b4 \u039b 4 l2P . (4.44)\nwhich can be rewritten in the following suggestive way (with b being the numerical factor from the previous section)\n\u03bbcc = 8\u03c0 b4 c4 N ( l2P l2 ) 1 l2 . (4.45)\nNote that we have neglected numerical terms that can be extracted from the precise form of the metastring one loop (toroidal) partition function defined in the previous section.\nThird: Now, we have to remember that the metastring that exists in this extensified spacetime gravitates in such a way that the semiclassical gravity conditions regarding the holographic scaling of entropy S of de Sitter space (associated with the cosmological horizon of 4 dimensional de Sitter space) or the number of degrees of freedom N , hold. In other words, apart from the vacuum energy density, we can look at the holographic formula for entropy (up to another numerical factor d4, in 4 spacetime dimensions)\nN def = S =\nd4 l 2\nl2P \u2192 N l\n2 P\nd4 l2 = 1. (4.46)\nHere we are invoking the fact that Einstein-Hilbert action can be derived by the metastring and that in the semiclassical limit, by the usual computation a la Gibbons-Hawking [270], we get that the entropy is given by the co-dimension one volume of spacetime \u2014 that is area of the cosmological horizon for a space with a positive cosmological constant. Note that the metastring, via the low energy action found in context of a doubled formulation of the world sheet theory of the closed string, does imply a positive cosmological constant. This is discussed in [18] which builds on our previous metastring papers and it can be seen more explicitly as follows: To lowest (zeroth) order of the expansion in the non-commutative parameter \u03bb the low energy effective action (in 4d) takes the form:\nS4d = \u2212 \u222b\u222b \u221a \u2212g(x) \u221a \u2212g\u0303(x\u0303) [R(x) + R\u0303(x\u0303)], (4.47)\na result which first was obtained almost three decades ago by assuming that [x\u0302a, \u02c6\u0303xb] = 0 [90]. In this leading limit, the x\u0303-integration in the first term defines the gravitational constant GN , and in the second term produces a positive cosmological constant constant \u039b > 0. In particular, we are lead to the following low energy effective action valid at long distances of the observed accelerated universe (focusing on the relevant 3+1-dimensional spacetime X, of the +\u2212\u2212\u2212 signature):\nSeff = \u22121\n8\u03c0G \u222b X \u221a \u2212g ( \u03bbcc + 1 2 R +O(R2) ) , (4.48)\nwith \u03bbcc the positive cosmological constant (corresponding to the observed vacuum energy scale of 10\u22123 eV) and the O(R2) denote higher order corrections. The inclusion of the Gibbons-Hawking boundary term [270], leads in the evaluation of the Euclidean partition function defined by this effective action, whose logarithm gives the free energy and thus, after taking the derivative of the free energy with respect to the euclidean temperature, the above entropy of the de Sitter cosmological horizon, or, equivalently, our N .\nTherefore we get our first prediction, that the cosmological constant in the context of\nmetastrings can be naturally related to a large (cosmological) scale l of spacetime\n\u03bbcc = 8\u03c0 (b4d4 c4 ) 1 l2 , (4.49)\nwhere b4, c4, d4 are purely numerical, O(1) factors in 4 spacetime dimensions. The most important observation here is that for large l (the observed Hubble scale) we get the observed small and positive cosmological constant. This result is also radiatively stable and technically natural [241], as it depends only on the IR (and not UV) scale.\nNotice that the usual effective field theory argument (which is carried over in the canonical discussion of string theory, as in our review of Polchinski\u2019s treatment of this problem) assumes that effectively N = 1, and thus the scale of the background spacetime and the energy momentum scale are linked which leads to a Planckian universe with a huge cosmological constant and the cosmological constant problem.\nIt is the combination of the phase space nature of the metastring, together with the fact that the metastring lives in extensified spacetime built out of Planckian (modular) \u201cblocks\u201d, that via holography gives us naturally small cosmological constant. Note that we get that the associated size of the energy momentum space is given by a mixing of the cosmological size l and the Planck size lP (up to numerical factors d and c)\n\u03bbcc = 8\u03c0 (b4d4 c4 ) 1 l2 def = 8\u03c0b4\u039b 4l2P \u2192 \u039b = (d4 c4 )1/4 1\u221a l lP . (4.50)\nThis expression taken together with the Planckian size of the dual momenta \u039b\u0303 def = l\u22121P gives us the immediate scale \u00b5vac associated with the vacuum energy (and thus, related to the\nHiggs scale in the realistic situation) which is much lower than the Planck scale, and it is order of 1 TeV \u039b\u039b\u0303 = \u00b5vac \u2192 \u00b5vac = (d4 c4 )1/4 1\u221a l lP lP . (4.51) This is a stable scale by our construction and it offers a new perspective on the hierarchy problem. We see that in the context of the metastring approach to quantum gravity, the cosmological constant problem and the hierarchy problem are naturally related. We will comment more on this relation at the end of this section.\nWe note that the whole discussion presented above for 4 spacetime dimensions can be formally extended to any D+1 spacetime dimensions. We just summarize the relevant formulae (by setting all numerical factors to be of order one, for simplicity)\nlD+1\u039bD+1 \u223c N, N l D\u22121 P\nlD\u22121 \u223c 1, \u03bbcc \u223c\n1 l2 ,\n\u039bD+1 \u223c 1 l2lD\u22121P\n, \u039b\u0303 \u223c l\u22121P , \u00b5vac \u223c \u039b\u039b\u0303. (4.52)\nFinally, one might ask \u201cwhy is l large?\u201d This is equivalent to asking \u201cwhy is N large?\u201d The reason for this is the same as Schro\u0308dinger\u2019s answer to the question \u201cwhy are atoms small?\u201d, presented in his famous book \u201cWhat is Life?\u201d [271]. The answer is that if a large object is built of atoms then in order for that object to have a well defined size, the number of atoms n should be large, because the statistical fluctuation scales as 1\u221a n . Similarly, the number of modular spacetime \u201cblocks\u201d (spacetime atoms) N should be large so that the extensified spacetime should be stable in size, given the statistical fluctuation 1\u221a N . Note that numerically N \u223c 10124, which gives the following number of modular cells per each direction (say, x direction, in 4 spacetime dimensions), Nx \u223c 1031. This number is not that far off from the Avogadro number used in the canonical atomistic reasoning.\nAlso, in this regard we could use the Bekenstein-Hawking formula for the entropy of the cosmological horizon associated with de Sitter space (that was also an inspiration for [272]) and the statistical reasoning based on the Boltzmann-Einstein formula for entropy in order to argue that the small vacuum energy is entropically preferred (as was argued by Horava and Minic in [97]), and the probability distribution P def = exp(S), where S is the above entropy of de Sitter space, given by the area of the cosmological horizon, is of the Baum-Hawking form [270], dP \u223c exp(cM2P/\u03bbcc)d\u03bbcc, where P is the probability, \u03bbcc is the cosmological constant in 4 spacetime dimensions and MP is the Planck energy scale in 4 spacetime dimensions. This gives us a large probability for small \u03bbcc and thus, a large probability for large l or large N . Furthermore, when combined with the above seesaw formula, this gives us a statistically preferred value for the \u00b5vac which is of the order given by the matter (or Higgs) sector, which, as we already emphasized, sheds light on the hierarchy problem (\u00b5vac being exponentially small compared to the Planck energy scale).\nFinally we note the following: The size of the extensified spacetime can be defined as\nl = l lP lP def = mlP where m denotes the number of Planckian \u201cunits\u201d. Similarly, according to\nthe above argument, the size of energy-momentum space (in 3 + 1 spacetime dimensions) \u039b = 1\u221a l lP can be defined as \u039b = n l thus leading to large number of \u201cunits\u201d:\nm def =\nl\nlP , n def = ( l lP )1/2 (4.53)\nNote that while spacetime units are Planckian of size lP , the energy momentum space is given in units of 1 l , where l is the size of the entire spacetime. This, once again is not the usual reasoning based on effective field theory, according to which, the Planckian size of a spacetime unit leads to the inverse Planckian size of the energy-momentum space unit. Note that it is the ratio of the Hubble scale and the Planck scale that provides for the hierarchy needed to resolve the cosmological constant problem [241].\nFinally, a comment about the infrared finiteness of the metastring partition function. Polchinski makes the point in his textbook that the vacuum energy of the bosonic string is UV finite (the essential feature of string theory) but IR divergent, because of the tachyon. In particular, the partition function of the 26 dimensional bosonic string that Polchinski writes looks like\n2\u03c0V26\n\u222b d\u03c4 2\n\u03c42 (4\u03c02\u03b1\u2032\u03c42) \u221213 \u2211 i e\u2212\u03c0\u03b1 \u2032m2i \u03c42 (4.54)\nwhere the ground state is tachyonic with the tachyon mass squared being \u221224/l2s (and \u03b1\u2032 def = l2s). The tachyonic contribution diverges. That is why traditionally invokes supersymmetry (SuSy) and then compactifications followed by SuSy breaking, upon which the cosmological constant problem returns as it does in any effective field theory formulation.\nHowever, the modular cells of the metastring can be considered as a fully compactified (or dimensionally reduced to zero dimensions) bosonic string in 26 dimensions. It is well known that the mass squared of the tachyon is proportional to \u2212(D\u22122)/l2s , and thus the tachyon is massive and stable in zero dimensions. Thus the partition function is IR finite for each modular cell and any finite number of modular cells. The IR divergence appears only in the thermodynamic limit of the infinite extensification, that is, in the classical spacetime limit."

The second non-trivial claim is that N is given by the holographic bound. More precisely, in the limit of a classically extensified spacetime, we have the Gibbons-Hawking term (needed to make the classical action additive), evaluated at a boundary of spacetime, given an induced metric h on that boundary, and the second fundamental form K of the boundary 1\n8\u03c0G\n\u222b \u221a \u2212h d3x K (4.57)\nThe Gibbons-Hawking term is related to the area of the boundary of spacetime (assuming that the boundary could be chosen to be the (time) t-axis times a sphere of radius l)\u222b l \u221a \u2212h d3x = 4\u03c0l2 \u222b dt ( 1 +O(1/l) ) (4.58)\nas follows 1\n8\u03c0G\n\u222b \u221a \u2212h d3x K = 1\n8\u03c0G\n\u2202\n\u2202n\n\u222b \u221a \u2212h d3x (4.59)\nwhere \u2202 \u2202n is the relevant normal derivative.\nSo, more precisely, our holographic \u201cquantization\u201d condition should involve the regular-\nized area of the boundary of the classically extensified spacetime\n4GN = 4\u03c0l2 =\n\u222b l \u221a \u2212h d3x\u222b\ndt ( 1+O(1/l) ) (4.60) Thus the exact formula for the cosmological constant reads as follows\n\u03bbcc = 8\u03c0G N\u222b\nl\n\u221a \u2212g d4x\n(4.61)\nor after using holographic \u201cquantization\u201d\n\u03bbcc = 8\u03c02l2\u222b\nl\n\u221a \u2212g d4x\n(4.62)\nThus, given the measured values for \u03bbcc, G and the volume of the observed spacetime V4, we have\nN = \u03bbccV4 8\u03c0G\n(4.63)\nIn particular,\nV4 = al 4 (4.64)\nwith a being a very specific constant.

We will make a few comments about this possibility at the end of this subsection.\nFinally, let us rewrite the above formula (4.61) for the cosmological constant as\n\u03bbcc \u222b l \u221a \u2212g d4x = 8\u03c0GN = 2\u03c0N(4G) (4.66)\nwhich reminds us of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization, where 4G or 4l2P is the effective \u201cPlanck constant of quantum gravity\u201d. Now, we know that in the Einstein Hilbert action, there is precisely such a term that involves the cosmological constant\n1\n8\u03c0G \u03bbcc \u222b l \u221a \u2212g d4x (4.67)\nThus, we have a quantization of this part of the classical action. Note that this makes sense given the fact that \u03bbcc can be interpreted as \u201cenergy\u201d (the Wheeler-DeWitt equation with the cosmological constant reads H\u03a8 = \u03bbcc\u03a8). Note that the conjugate \u201ctime\u201d variable is the\nspacetime volume \u222b l \u221a \u2212gd4x. However, if one term in the action is quantized then all terms presumably follow the same quantization. Hence, the curvature term should be quantized as well 1\n2 \u222b l R \u221a \u2212g d4x = 2\u03c0N(4G) (4.68)\nwhere the 1/2 terms takes into account the usual normalization of 1/16\u03c0G) in front of the curvature term. Then the boundary Gibbons Hawking term, which makes the Einstein Hilbert action additive, should be quantized as well. Thus\u222b l K \u221a \u2212h d3x = 2\u03c0N(4G) (4.69)\nTherefore, if we take the boundary of spacetime to be a sphere times the time axis, the area of the boundary should be quantized as well, and if we took the Euclidean time to be simply 2\u03c0, this leads us to the holographic relation\nArea(l) def = 4\u03c0l2 = 4GN (4.70)\nwhich is precisely what we have already used in our argument. So, from this viewpoint, the holographic argument is not needed as an independent input \u2014 it is already contained in the quantization condition of phase space, that follows from modular polarization of quantum\ntheory and the process of extensification. Notice that the quantization condition involves 4G as the effective \u201cPlanck constant of quantum gravity\u201d, which also makes sense, given the appearance of precisely this factor in the Bekenstein-Hawking area law [270]. Also the factor of 2\u03c0 makes sense as the length of the Euclidean time. (Note that the above formula is related to the well known entropy formula for black holes, provided N is replaced by S \u2014 the black hole entropy. It is interesting to note that in Matrix theory S \u223c N [273], where N is the number of partons (D0-branes) that make a black-hole bound state.)\nIn some sense, the above new quantization procedure (invisible in effective field theory (EFT), as discussed in the next subsection) that leads to a small positive cosmological constant and thus ensures that a big spacetime is stable, is analogous to what Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization does for the stability of the Rutherford-Bohr atom. The Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization follows from fundamental commutators, and thus we might expect that the vacuum energy, the volume of spacetime and curvature are turned into operatorial quantities with appropriate (Heisenberg-like) commutators that lead to the above quantization formulae. It would be interesting to understand if that follows from modular quantization.\nFinally, the quantization of area has been postulated by Bekenstein and Mukhanov for black hole horizons in their 1995 paper [274]. Proposals to detect this quantization of the black hole horizon area via \u201cechoes\u201d in gravitational waves using LIGO-Virgo Collaboration have been discussed in the literature (see, for example, [275] and more recently, [276]). In our context, the discovery of such \u201cechoes\u201d could be interpreted as empirical evidence for modular spacetime. Here we want to mention the recent critical discussion of echoes of gravitational waves as presented in [277], in which the original literature on this subject is listed (such as [278]). The conclusion of this critical essay is: \u201cThus if echoes are actually detected, then we would face a profound change in our understanding of physics.\u201d In our case, the new quantum number N is very large (N \u223c 10124), and thus we are really discussing the quantum chaos phase of the quantum black hole physics. Thus the gravitational wave signals could be expected to display (apart from echoes) certain robust signatures of quantum chaos, such as scars \u2014 that is, a well known phenomenon where the eigenstates of a classically chaotic quantum system have enhanced probability density around the paths of unstable classical periodic orbits. This could be a distinguishing (\u201csmoking gun\u201d) signature in our context."

            "heading": "4.8 Comments on the Effective Field Theory Breakdown",
            "text": "As we have mentioned the usual effective field theory argument assumes that effectively \u039b \u223c 1/lP (even though the EFT limit can be understood as a double scaling limit, as discussed in the previous subsection), and thus the scale of the background spacetime and the energy momentum scale are linked which leads to a Planckian universe with a huge cosmological constant and the cosmological constant problem. Many authors have recently attempted the discussion of the breakdown of effective field theory in the context of quantum gravity; see, for example, [272,279\u2013284]. Nevertheless, we consider the separation of various\nscales \u039b, \u039b\u0303 and \u00b5 as a unique feature of metastring theory. This, as far as we know, has not been pointed out before in the literature. (Here we recall the suggestion of Veltman, mentioned in his 1999 Nobel prize lecture, that one should work in phase space in order to address the cosmological constant problem \u2014 and that is a crucial feature of the argument presented in [241], as summarized in this section.)\nIn particular, we can connect our work to Cohen, Kaplan and Nelson [272] because these authors discuss a constraint on the validity of effective field theory in the limit of a large volume. (That would correspond to a very small, Planckian, volume of the dual space, which does not appear in their discussion.) In their well known work, Cohen, Kaplan and Nelson [272] say that \u201cthe length L, which acts as an IR cutoff, cannot be chosen independently of the UV cutoff, and scales as \u039b\u22123,\u201d where \u039b is the UV cutoff. Note that we have established that there is a kind of seesaw relation between UV in \u201cour\u201d space and IR in the dual one, and so the natural question is: how can this provide us with any relation between UV and IR in \u201cour\u201d spacetime? We claim that this is a matter of what kind of spacetime interpretation we adopt. For example, if we think of our \u039b as the spacetime IR scale (whose fourth power gives the observed vacuum energy density, or the cosmological constant) and the \u039b\u0303 as the spacetime UV (Planck) scale, then they are not independent: Their product is given by \u00b5vac, which is naturally given by the Higgs scale \u2014 since the minimum of the Higgs potential defines the vacuum. This interpretation agrees with [272].\nHere we also note, as an aside, that the above seesaw relation is characteristic of the relation between the quantum (Compton) scale and the gravitational (Schwarzschild) scale for a given mass M . The Compton scale is LQ = ~/(Mc) and the Schwarzschild scale in 3+1 dimensions is LGR = 2MGN/c\n2 and thus their product is LQLGR = 2~GN/c3, which is essentially the square of the Planck scale LQLGR \u223c L2P . It is interesting that in the above \u201cseesaw\u201c formula for the cosmological constant [18] the product of the IR and the UV scale is given by an intermediate (Higgs) scale that determines the observed vacuum of the matter degrees of freedom, which is much lower than the Planck scale, indicating a possible relation between the hierarchy problem and the cosmological constant problem [18], to which we will return below.\nTo summarize: in this section we have discussed the vacuum energy problem in the context of the metastring approach to quantum gravity (as well as its metaparticle limit). Our central observation is that the solution of the vacuum energy problem is naturally offered by an effective, chirally doubled and non-commutative structure of quantum spacetime, the habitat for metastrings and metaparticles. A generically small cosmological constant is realized in string theory via the interplay between the phase space structure of the metastring and the holographic principle of quantum gravity. The same set-up implies a generic seesaw formula between the vacuum energy scale and the Planck scale and it leads to the natural resolution of the hierarchy problem in string theory. Our discussion is intrinsically stringy and we have pointed out quite explicitly where the usual reasoning based on effective field theory breaks down, as seen in our more general approach to quantum gravity based on\nmetastring theory and modular spacetime. Finally, we point out that our set-up has a predictive power when applied to cosmology, and in particular the equation of state for the dark energy, as already emphasized in [285].\nComing back to the problem of de Sitter space in string theory, this new understanding of the string vacuum and its vacuum energy, as well as its implication for the cosmological constant problem, sheds light on the meaning of de Sitter entropy as counting the degeneracy of the quantum vacuum, defined in the modular (quantum) polarization of quantum theory, together with the process of extensification, that results in a classical spacetime background.\nLet us close with a remark about the coincidence problem: Why is the universe in the accelerating phase now, and why is dark energy dominant and the dark matter is of the order of the visible matter? Here the fact that dark and visible matter could be correlated in the metaparticle formulation (as explained in the next section) does address the second observed feature regarding the similar abundances of the invisible (dark) and visible matter degrees of freedom. Similarly, the necessary input that holography (and IR condition) provided in the choice of modular vacuum which is determined by the cosmological constant, does shed light on the fist observed feature \u2014 that we are in the cosmological phase dominated by the cosmological constant. One would be tempted to say that the interplay of the IR and UV physics makes our discussion only \u201cweakly anthropic\u201d when it comes to the coincidence problem. However we think that this is not a correct interpretation and that anthropics (even of the weak kind) should be replaced by quantum contextuality, which appears as a fundamental feature of the modular polarization in quantum theory."

            "heading": "4.9 Metastring, the Cosmological Constant and the Higgs Mass",
            "text": "In this final subsection we address the following issue: So far, our argument for the vacuum energy was based on the properties of modular spacetime (including the concept of extensification) and holography. The metastring really enters as an example of a theory of quantum gravity consistent with modular spacetime, but not in any other fundamental way. Can string theory enter in a fundamental way and perhaps illuminate the other hierarchy problem related to the Higgs sector of the Standard Model? Does the new insight into the vacuum of string theory illuminates the question of the Higgs mass (and perhaps masses of other elementary particles)? We will make some preliminary observations about these fascinating questions in what follows.\nThe metastring is endowed with two Heisenberg algebras [83\u201385, 242\u2013247]. Apart from the non-zero \u201cphase space\u201d commutator familiar from quantum mechanics [x, p] = i (with ~ = 1) that we have used in the above, there is the same type of commutator for the dual \u201cphase space\u201d (and that one is taken care of by assuming the Planckian size for the dual spacetime and the Planckian energy scale for the dual momentum space). However, there is also the uniquely metastring commutator between the spacetime and dual spacetime\ncoordinates [x, x\u0303] = il2s , which involves the string length ls. In the following we insist on the compatibility of these two Heisenberg algebras.\nLet us apply the same type of reasoning presented in [241] by combining the modular space associated with this second Heisenberg algebra (together with the concept of extensification) and holography, and let us find out the consequences of that line of reasoning.\nFirst we have that (in 4 extensified spacetime dimensions) with N fluxes in the modular space of x, x\u0303, where the extensified length of x is now l\u039b, the length scale associated with the vacuum energy (already determined in our previous discussion to be the geometric mean l\u039b = \u221a l lP of the observed size of spacetime l \u223c 1027m and the Planck length lP \u223c 10\u221235m, giving l\u039b \u223c 10\u22124m), and the length of x\u0303 is l\u0303\nl\u039b l\u0303 = l 2 sN 1/4 L = l 2 s ( l2\u039b l2P )1/4 = l2s ( l\u039b lP )1/2 (4.76)\nwhere as before the number of fluxes is given by the holographic bound in the dual space NL = l2\u039b l2P . Note that here we have crucially used the vacuum energy length scale l\u039b, because we are concerned with the properties of the vacuum of string theory. What we mean is that the natural \u201cholographic\u201d bound in the dual space is set by the size of the energy momentum space that reproduces the observed vacuum energy. Thus NL \u223c l2\u039b/l2P .\nNote that the string length ls and the Planck length lP (related to G) are related via the string coupling gs gsls = lP , Ms = gsMP (4.77)\nwhere MP is the Planck energy scale and Ms the string energy scale. Taking this conversion between lP that features in the holographic bound (and thus, the number of fluxes, NL) and the string length ls that features in the second Heisenberg algebra of the metastring, we get\nl\u0303 = lP g2s ( lP l\u039b )1/2 (4.78)\nNow, let us demand that the extend of the dual spacetime is essentially lP , and so l\u0303 def = lP . (This was an implicit demand in our reasoning about the vacuum energy, but it turned out that it did not enter that discussion. However, this demand is consistent with the assumption that the size of the \u201cphase space\u201d defined by the dual spacetime and dual momenta is Planckian. Thus, l\u0303 = lP is a consistent assumption.)\nThen the above formula gives us the value of the string coupling gs in terms of the size\nof the vacuum energy length scale l\u039b and the Planck length lP : gs = ( lP l\u039b )1/4 def = (M\u039b MP )1/4 \u2192 g2s = (M\u039b MP )1/2 (4.79)\nwhere M\u039b is the energy scale associated with the vacuum energy. Note that this is a very small value, which would justify our one-loop computation of the metastring partition function (the two and higher loops would be suppressed by this small string coupling). Also,\nthis would suggest a much lower scale for metastrings which would get close to the scales of accelerator-based particle physics.\nNaturally this leads us to the gauge hierarchy problem and the mass of the observed Higgs. We will use the results regarding the stringy computation of the Higgs mass presented in Ref. [286]. In that paper Abel and Dienes claim to \u201cestablish a fully string-theoretic framework for calculating one-loop Higgs masses directly from first principles in perturbative closed string theories. This framework makes no assumptions other than worldsheet modular invariance and is therefore applicable to all closed strings, regardless of the specific string construction utilized. This framework can also be employed even when spacetime supersymmetry is broken (and even when this breaking occurs at the Planck scale), and can be utilized for all scalar Higgs fields, regardless of the particular gauge symmetries they break. This therefore includes the Higgs field responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking in the Standard Model.\u201d Notably, using this framework, Abel and Dienes demonstrate \u201cthat a gravitational modular anomaly generically relates the Higgs mass to the one-loop cosmological constant, thereby yielding a string-theoretic connection between the two fundamental quantities which are known to suffer from hierarchy problems in the absence of spacetime supersymmetry\u201d [286].\nThus, let us look at the formula of Abel and Dienes [286, Eq. (2.57)] that relates the\nHiggs mass to the cosmological constant\nm2H = \u03be\u039b4 M2P \u2212 g 2 sM 2 s 8\u03c02 \u3008X \u3009, (4.80)\nwhere \u03be being defined in [286, Eq. (2.48)] as a particular T -matrix trace, and X is a suitably normalized insertion in the second moment of the partition function [286, Eq. (2.33)]. Let us examine the first term. By looking at it one might say immediately that it does not fit the observed Higgs mass mH \u223c 125 GeV) if one plugs in the new stringy result for the vacuum energy (cosmological constant) reviewed in the previous subsection. Thus this term seems practically irrelevant. The second term, after we take the square root and take into account the absolute value of this term, gives\nmH \u223c gsMs \u221a \u3008X \u3009 8\u03c02 = g2sMP \u221a \u3008X \u3009 8\u03c02\n(4.81)\nNow let us use the derived consequence of the second Heisenberg algebra of the metastring (the fundamental non-commutativity of the spacetime and dual spacetime coordinates) and holography in the observed 4 dimensional spacetime, namely that the string coupling is g2s = ( M\u039b MP )1/2.\nThis implies the following seesaw formula for the Higgs mass in string theory (in which the cosmological constant is also small and positive, as in our previous argument regarding the vacuum energy in metastring theory)\nmH \u223c \u221a M\u039bMP \u221a \u3008X \u3009 8\u03c02\n(4.82)\nwhere M\u039b is energy scale associated with the vacuum energy (10 \u22123 eV) and MP is the Planck energy (1019 GeV). The geometric mean of these two energy scales gives us a TeV, and thus\nthe observed Higgs mass can be obtained if \u221a \u3008X\u3009 8\u03c02 \u223c 10\u22122, of if \u3008X \u3009 \u223c 1 \u2014 consistent with the defining equations [286, Eq. (2.27) and (2.33)].\nNote that the above argument relies on a subtle combination of holography in x-space with the second Heisenberg algebra between x and x\u0303. In this argument x\u0303 is still of the Planck size as we assumed in the argument regarding the cosmological constant. The factor of NL really comes from holography in x-space but taking into account the effective length scale associated with vacuum energy l\u039b and the power N 1/4 L is consistent with what we said about phase space in our argument regarding the cosmological constant. (One may say that the UV/IR is manifested though the relation between the dual space and momentum space via the string length. So the two Heisenberg algebras, one between x and p and the other between x and x\u0303 are mutually consistent.) Also the relation between holography in x-space and the non-commutativity between x and x\u0303 leads to a unique relation between the Planck and string scales as well as the vacuum energy scale. (And, as consequence of that, we get a very specific statement about the Higgs mass.)\nFinally, the string scale turns out to correspond roughly to the geometric mean of the Higgs and the Planck scales, which numerically corresponds to the GZK scale found in high energy cosmic rays. (The QCD axions also have a very similar scale, according to the most recent bounds.) This can be seen by plugging gs = (M\u039b/MP ) 1/4 into Ms = gsMP and using the above formula for the Higgs mass mH \u223c \u221a M\u039bMP \u221a \u3008X\u3009 8\u03c02 in order to obtain (approximately)\nMs \u223c \u221a mHMP (4.83)\nwhich does yield to a pretty low scale of around 1011 GeV.\nThe above argument intuitively makes sense because, in string theory, the one-loop expression for the vacuum energy is related to the one-loop expectation value for the dilaton, which is in turn related to the string coupling, and this in turn sets the relation between the string and Planck scales. However, in order to understand that precisely, we need to properly implement modular quantization of the metastring. Also, we note that the above seesaw formula is consistent with the seesaw-like form of the diffeomorphism constraint in metastring theory. We will comment on this seesaw relation (a feature of our toy model as well) in Section 6.\nThis argument taken together with the above formula that relates the Higgs mass and the vacuum energy in string theory (evaluated in the modular spacetime/metastring formulation of string theory which combines the phase space nature with the holographic nature of the string vacuum) does lead to a new, and completely stringy view of the hierarchy problem. Note finally, that the whole set-up of Abel and Dienes is perfectly suitable for the modular spacetime formulation of string theory (the metastring). It would be interesting to generalize\nthe formalism of Abel and Dienes for the case of fermion masses and check whether \u201cseesawlike\u201d formulae appear as well; see [287,288]) as well as [289]."

            "heading": "5.1 AdS Holography vs. dS Holography",
            "text": "Another approach to understanding de Sitter space in string theory is to start with de Sitter spacetime (as implied by the cosmological observations) and try to define it in terms of a dual, holographic description, that is in principle consistent with a broad definition of the space of string theory in terms of the abstract space of D-dimensional conformal field theories and the renormalization group flows on this space (extending the old view of string theory in terms of the abstract space of 2d conformal field theories and the corresponding 2d RG flows). This approach, dubbed as dS/CFT duality [42, 290\u2013294] is obviously inspired by its better known progenitor, the AdS/CFT [296\u2013298] duality. Note that the emphasis here is on the CFT side of duality, so the fact that AdS is realized in the geometric (spacetime) formulation of string theory is not central.\nOne starts from the Lorentzian SO(D+1, 1) isometries of the Euclidean AdSD+1\nds2 = dr2 + eArds2flat, (AdS) (5.1)\nand Lorentzian dSD+1 spaces (see Section 2.1)\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + eH tds2flat, (dS) (5.2) (written in the corresponding flat patches, with A \u223c \u221a |\u039bAdS| and H \u223c \u221a \u039bdS). That is, both spaces, Lorentzian de Sitter (dS) (\u039b > 0) and Euclidean Anti-de-Sitter (AdS) (\u039b < 0) are hyperboloids\n\u2212x20 + x21 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ x2D+1 = l2, |\u039b| = D(D\u22121)\n2l2 , (5.3)\nembedded in flat space with signature (1, D+1).\nGiven this geometric fact, there exists a non-local map from the Lorentzian dS space to the corresponding Euclidean AdS space, which respects the corresponding bulk isometries and thus the boundary conformal structures. In particular [294],\n\u03c8(Y ) = \u222b dX K(Y,X)\u03c6(X), (5.4)\nwhere dX denotes the invariant measure of dS space, and the kernel K(X, Y ) commutes with the SO(D+1, 1) actions. Under this map, the two boundaries of dS are mapped onto the single boundary of Euclidean AdS. However, this does not imply that the dual of dS is a single conformal field theory, as is the case of Euclidean AdS. Due to a non-local nature of the map, if one knows a field in the Euclidean AdS, one cannot reconstruct the integrals of the corresponding field on dS along null geodesics. This is the reason for the claim that the dual of dS involves two entangled conformal field theories [42,292,294].\nMore precisely, as discussed in [294],\nK(gX, gY ) = K(X, Y ) (5.5)\nwhere g \u2208 SO(D+1, 1). Using suitable g, we can always achieve that Xi = 0 for i < d, and XD+1 = 1. Call such a point E. Then it is sufficient to know K(E, Y ), because by acting with the group we can recover the rest of K from this. The point E is preserved by a SO(D, 1) subgroup. This can be used to write Y as\nY (\u03be) def = (Y0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, YD+1) = ( \u221a 1 + \u03be2, 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, 0, \u03be). (5.6)\nTherefore, the kernel is completely determined by a function of a single variable,\nK(E, Y (\u03be)) def = K(\u03be) (5.7)\nWe can write the kernel explicitly, once we are given K(\u03be). To describe that result, we start with the description of Lorentzian de Sitter spacetime as a hyperboloid immersed in the flat Minkowski space. de Sitter spacetime is described by\nP (X,X) = 1 (5.8)\nwhere we have set the cosmological constant to one and where\nP (X, Y ) = \u2212X0Y0 +X1Y1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+XD+1YD+1 (5.9)\nNote that P (gX, gY ) = P (X, Y ), and also P (E, Y (\u03be)) = \u03be. Thus one can show that [294]\nK(X, Y ) = \u222b d\u03be \u03b4 ( P (X, Y )\u2212 \u03be ) K(\u03be) (5.10)\nsatisfies all the required properties. In particular, if K(\u03be) = \u03b4(\u03be) we have the Radon transform known from the studies of tomography [299].\nIn particular, as discussed in [294], given a point X of Lorentzian 3 dimensional de Sitter spacetime defined by P (X,X) = 1, and U a point on conformal boundary of de Sitter spacetime specified by P (U,U) = 0, then the explicit non-local map to Euclidean 3 dimensional Anti-de Sitter spacetime (and a point Y on it) is given by\n\u03c8(Y, U) = \u222b dX \u03b4 ( P (X, Y ) ) |P (X,U)|\u22121\u2212i\u03c1/2 (5.11)\nwhere i\u03c1 is related to the conformal dimension of the dual operator in the AdS/CFT correspondence.\nGiven this non-local transform from the Euclidean AdS space to the Lorentzian dS space, one is tempted to define dS/CFT correspondence in analogy with the well known AdS/CFT case. The problem is that these two spaces are radically different and thus one has to be extremely careful in such a holographic definition of dS spacetime in string theory.\nIn the context of the AdS/CFT dictionary we have a well defined background in the supergravity limit. This is precisely the issue for the case of dS spacetime, as reviewed in Section 2, even though we will argue that there exists a realization of dS spacetime in string theory if one does not follow the traditional route, as discussed in the previous section and in what follows. However, even without a supergravity solution, one should expect to be able to construct, or define a dS spacetime in string theory via the holographic dictionary.\nAs discussed in [294], the issue is that one CFT will not suffice. Even if one starts on the well defined AdS side and applies the above non-local map in order to get to the dS side, there is an issue with the causal structure which becomes degenerate under such a non-local map. In order to properly take into account the causal structure of dS (and, in particular, the presence of the cosmological horizon and the related dS entropy \u2014 the reasons for the \u201ccosmological breaking of supersymmetry\u201d), one should consider two entangled CFTs and thus realize the finite entropy of dS space as an entanglement entropy. We will sharpen this message in what follows."

            "text": "The main message of [42,292,294] is that de Sitter holography involves non-canonical CFTs involving non-canonical conjugations of the generators of conformal transformations, and in particular, the Virasoro generator conjugation is L\u2020n = \u2212L\u2212n. Also, the holographic dual of dS (in global coordinates) requires two entangled non-canonical CFTs so that the thermal properties of the vacuum de Sitter spacetime are recovered [300,301]. Finally, the holographic dictionary that relates the generators of correlations functions in two entangled theories to the bulk action in the Lorentzian space, requires a non-canonical Hilbert space structure\nof the dual Hilbert space. This is the crucial difference in understanding of holographic descriptions in the AdS and dS cases, and points to the crucial issues in realizing dS space in string theory.\nA very useful toy example: The above picture does have a very nice toy example. Consider AdS3 and dS3 from the viewpoint of the 3d Chern-Simons (CS) theory [302]. The main point here is that the two solutions AdS3 and dS3, come equipped with a canonical and non-canonical inner product of the corresponding Hilbert spaces. Such non-canonical Hilbert space structures represent the counterpart of the non-canonical conformal field theory involved in the holographic description of de Siter space.\nThe reason for the unusual inner product follows from the relation between CS theory in the 3d bulk and the WZW theory on the boundary. The CS action relevant for the positive \u039b case\nS = c[ICS(A)\u2212 ICS(A\u0304)], (5.12)\nwhere, c is a constant (that includes the complex WZW level), and ICS is the usual CS action\nICS(A) =\n\u222b d3x Tr ( A \u2227 dA+ 2 3 A3 ) . (5.13)\nHere the gauge field A takes values in SL(2,C), A\u0304 is the complex conjugate of A, and the Vielbein and the spin connections are given as\n2ie = A\u2212 A\u0304, 2\u03c9 = A+ A\u0304. (5.14)\nThe main point here is that, in the negative \u039b case (AdS) one has independent SL(2,R) theories, and in the positive \u039b case, one has a different hermiticity condition that involves an exchange of left and right movers in the WZW theory. This is precisely what one finds by looking at a free scalar in dS space [42,292,294].\nWe remark that the question of observables in the context of dS holography is still debated [303]. However, the above definition of de Sitter holography can be connected to metastring theory, modular spacetime and modular polarization in quantum theory, and thus the questions of observables should be framed in that context. We will comment on that question in the next subsection. The main point of the holographic approach to de Sitter spacetime in string theory is that the relevant dual boundary CFT (holographically dual to bulk de Sitter space) has a non-canonical structure [42,292,294], which is manifested with a non-canonical inner product on the associated Hilbert space.35 This non-canonical structure is hard to account for in the context of compactifications (especially the ones that lead to spaces compatible with spacetime interpretation in string theory, such as Anti-de Sitter\n35See also the recent discussion of dS space based on von Neumann algebras [303], as well as the old work by Connes and Rovelli about time, the modular group and von Neumann algebras [304]. This is particularly appropriate in our discussion of dS holography based on the insights gained from the metastring which is intrinsically non-commutative and lives in modular spacetime backgrounds.\nspace). This is also one of the main obstacles to finding de Sitter spacetime via string compactifications in the spacetime formulation of string theory. In what follows we will tie the non-canonical CFT to dual spacetime, and formulate de Sitter holography, for a large dS spacetime (with a naturally small cosmological constant), using the insights based on the concepts of modular spacetime and metastrings, which we have utilized to give a clarification of the vacuum energy problem in string theory in the previous section."

            "text": "In this section we want to relate above intuitions about dS holography to metastrings and modular spacetime. First we propose the following intuitive picture: The \u201cwave function\u201d of a large dS spacetime, viewed as an entangled state of two CFTs, one at infinite past and one at infinite future, can be modeled as a BCS wave function for superconductivity, where the vacuum state is given by the Euclidean, Hartle-Hawking vacuum. This picture incorporates the well known view of an eternal AdS black hole as an entangled state in two boundary CFTs [305]. We will place this proposal in the context of the metastring formulation of string theory in modular spacetime that we used in our discussion of vacuum energy problem in string theory.\nLet us first discuss this analogy between dS holography and the BCS theory of superconductivity. In the BCS theory of superconductivity, the superconducting phase is a state with broken symmetry (at low temperature) and the metal phase is an unbroken, normal phase, with restored symmetry (at high temperature). Phenomenologically, the current is directly related to the vector potential (as in the London equation) \u2014 this is just the conserved stationary current of the Abelian Higgs model, describing the simplest symmetry breaking (Higgs) mechanism: ~ = c ~A. The entanglement in the BCS set-up involves pairs of quasiparticles (quasi-electrons) found around the Fermi surface, with opposite momenta (Cooper pairs). The pairing happens dynamically via an electron-phonon interaction. The normal phase is a Fermi liquid, with a well defined Fermi surface and free, dressed, quasi-electrons around it. (An insightful presentation of the effective field theory of the Fermi surface is given in Polchinski\u2019s 1992 TASI lectures [306]). The BCS theory proposes a variational wave-function that describes the ground state of such pairs, which minimizes the energy of the BCS interacting Hamiltonian. Then one gets the gap equation, for the mass gap around the Fermi surface. This formula is essentially non-perturbative. (Polchinski also discussed the effective field theory approach to superconductivity in his 1992 TASI lectures.)\nWe would like to propose an analogue of this famous picture for the two entangled CFTs of dS holography, one living in the infinite past and the other in the infinite future. The analogue of the superconducting phase is dS space. The analogue of the normal phase is Euclidean AdS space. The analogue of the London equation is the relation between the energy-momentum tensor and the metric, which involves the cosmological constant: Tab = \u039bgab. The analogue of the BCS wave-function is the entangled wave-function of dS\nuniverse. The analogue of the gap is the cosmological constant, and the gap equation is replaced by a non-perturbative formula for the cosmological constant (found in our cosmicstring-like toy model of de Sitter space in string theory as well as in our discussion of the vacuum energy problem in metastring theory).\nLet us recall some basic relations from the BCS theory, following the presentation from Feynman\u2019s book [307, Chapter 10] on superconductivity. The BCS wave-function reads as follows:\n\u03a8BCS = \u220f k \u03c8k (5.15)\nwhere\n\u03c8k = (uk + vka \u2020 ka \u2020 \u2212k)\u03c60 (5.16)\nwhere \u03c60 is the ground state described by the Fermi liquid (of free, dressed quasi-electrons around the Fermi surface) and |uk|2 + |vk|2 = 1. These variational parameters are found by minimizing the BCS Hamiltonian, given by the quadratic and quartic terms:\nHBCS = \u2211 k (eka \u2020 kak + e\u2212ka \u2020 \u2212ka\u2212k) + \u2211 k,k\u2032 Vk,k\u2032a \u2020 k\u2032a \u2020 \u2212k\u2032aka\u2212k. (5.17)\nThe minimization gives the gap equation: Ek = \u221a e2k + \u2206 2 k, (5.18)\nwhere the gap is defined by the equation for the variational parameters upon minimizing the BCS Hamiltonian, \u2206k = \u2212 \u2211 k\u2032 Vkk\u2032uk\u2032vk\u2032 , (5.19) and where also\nu2k = 1\n2\n( 1\u2212 ek\nEk\n) , v2k = 1\n2\n( 1 +\nek Ek\n) . (5.20)\nOne thereby obtains the gap equation:\n\u2206k = \u2212 \u2211 k\u2032 Vkk\u2032 \u2206k\u2032 2 \u221a e2k\u2032 + \u2206 2 k\u2032 . (5.21)\nFor an isotropic situation, we have constant interaction V with the range of ec above and below the Fermi surface, and zero otherwise. This produces the following fairly simple gap equation for \u2206:\n1 = \u2212V \u2211 k\n1 2 \u221a e2k + \u2206 2 , (5.22)\nwhich gives (upon the replacement of the sum by an integral) the following non-perturbative formula (characteristic of dimensional transmutation in the purely exponential regime) for the gap \u2206:\n1 = |V | 2 \u222b ec \u2212ec D(e) de\u221a e2 + \u22062 \u223c |V |D(0) \u222b ec 0 de\u221a e2 + \u22062 , (5.23)\nwhere D(e) is the density of states. Thus, finally,\n\u2206 = ec\nsinh( 1|V |D(0)) (5.24)\nwhere D(0) is the density of state at the Fermi surface. V is positive for the electron-phonon interaction which leads to the formation of Cooper pairs. All of this can be generalized to finite temperatures and successfully compared to the actual experiment.\nNow we propose analogous equations for dS holography, concentrating on dS3 and two entangled 2d CFT duals. We will replace the creation and annihilation operators a by their Virasoro counterparts (in momentum space) Ln (where we have to sum over all n in our case), with non-canonical conjugation properties that we have already discussed. Also, the gap will become the cosmological constant. The reason why the cosmological constant is the analogue of the gap is contained in the well known formula for acceleration in dS space [308]\nadS = \u221a a2 + a20 (5.25)\nwhere a0 is the natural acceleration cH0 and H0 is the Hubble constant in dS space, set by the cosmological constant. By the Unruh-Hawking formula [270], this acceleration is related to the Unruh-Hawking temperature, which is essentially of the units of energy, and which makes the analogy with the corresponding equation found in the context of superconductivity reasonable. Note that this formula also works in AdS space, where AdS is consistent with supersymmetry (SuSy) and so corresponds to the normal phase with unbroken SuSy, whereas dS can be understood as the broken phase, wherein SuSy is cosmologically broken. Thus the gap in our dS case should be related to the dS acceleration, and thus, the cosmological constant. The SuSy breaking scale could be related to an effective low string scale of 1011 GeV discussed in the previous section.\nThis analogy leads to the following wave-function for a large dS universe \u03a8dS = \u220f k \u03c8k (5.26)\nwhere\n\u03c8k = \u220f n (uk,n + vk,nL \u2020 k,nL \u2020 \u2212k,\u2212n)\u03c60 (5.27)\nwhere the positive momentum label refers to the future infinity and negative momentum label to past infinity. Note that we have to use the momentum space version of the Virasoro generators. The dS analogue of the BCS Hamiltonian is\nHdS = \u2211 k,n (ek,nL \u2020 k,nLk,n + e\u2212k,\u2212nL \u2020 \u2212k,\u2212nL\u2212k,\u2212n)\n+ \u2211\nk,k\u2032;n,n\u2032\nVk,k\u2032;n,n\u2032L \u2020 k\u2032,n\u2032L \u2020 \u2212k\u2032,\u2212n\u2032Lk,nL\u2212k,\u2212n.\n(5.28)\nThis is one of our crucial points. In order to describe a large dS spacetime in terms of two entangled CFTs with non-canonical conjugation properties and (in general, dynamical) Hilbert space structure, one needs to invoke a second quantized, and in principle, nonperturbative formulation. Such a formulation is quite natural from the point of view of the metastring, and we will comment on that in the remainder of this section.\nGiven this model Hamiltonian for dS holography, we follow the steps already presented in the BCS theory. The final gap equation gives essentially a non-perturbative formula for the cosmological constant, involving an exponential of the interaction V and the density of states in the AdS CFT, DAdS.\nM\u039b = McAdS exp ( \u2212 1 |V |DAdS ) (5.29)\nHere McAdS is some critical energy scale, with naturally Planckian dimensions, associated with the AdS ground state. Notice that precisely such an exponential hierarchy emerges in our toy model, as reviewed in Section 3. This is essentially the seesaw formula which includes the exponential hierarchy. This formula is also consistent with our discussion of vacuum energy that combines the phase-space/modular spacetime features of the metastring with its holographic features [241]. We remark that V should be positive as in the BCS theory.\nA couple of comments are in order: The London equation captures the diamagnetic character of superconductivity \u2014 the expulsion of the magnetic field lines. On the dS side, this would amount to an \u201ceffective antigravity\u201d, which is exactly what the positive cosmological constant describes: the equation of state is p = \u2212\u03c1. Similarly, the London equation implies the vanishing of resistance in the superconducting phase. On the dS side, the analogue of resistance is the Newton constant (because it relates the field to the source in Einstein\u2019s equations), so the weakness of gravity is captured by this fact, which translates into widely separated scales involving the characteristic matter scale and the natural Planck scale. Also, one can work in the two-fluid picture of normal and superconducting electron fluids. It is tempting to associate this to the two-spacetime pictures, of normal and dual spacetime as offered by the metastring formulation of general string theory reviewed in Section 4.\nThe whole description of the analogy of dS holography and superconductivity is quantum, gravitational (gravity would be needed for providing an attractive and thus positive interaction V ) and, in principle, non-perturbative. So, from this point of view a non-perturbative formulation of string theory (already outlined in the previous section and also discussed later in the review) in a holographic limit of large dS spacetimes does lead to dS spaces with a naturally small cosmological constant, which is also related to an exponential hierarchy between the Planck scale and the observed characteristic matter scales. This non-perturbative formula should be also indicative of a non-perturbative (cosmological) breaking of supersymmetry that underlies this holographic dS description.\nNote that the original proposal by Balasubramanian, de Boer and Minic (BdBM) [42,\n292, 294], was mainly concerned with dS3, and as such, it has involved two entangled 2d CFTs with Virasoro generators. This is really analogous to Maldacena\u2019s treatment of black holes in AdS3 [305]. However, the BdBM proposal can be extended to the realistic case of dS4, in which case the holographic definition involves two entangled 3d CFTs. The natural candidate here is the Gustavsson-Bagger-Lambert theory [309\u2013311], which appears in the non-perturbative formulation of n-interacting membranes, of the ABJM model [312], which is the logical 3d analogue of the N = 4 conformal SYM in 4d. However, these theories should be quantized in a generic modular polarization [241].\nFinally, in view of the new understanding of the string vacuum presented in the previous section, such a holographic formulation of de Sitter space (holography being one of the central features of the argument presented in Section 4) should involve both the spacetime and dual spacetime, as well as the corresponding momenta, in such a way that in the early universe the dual degrees of freedom dominate, whereas in the late universe the visible degrees of freedom are dominant, as pointed out in [250]. Thus de Sitter space should be given as a BCS-like entangled state between two CFTs, one of which, in the infinite past, is formulated in terms of dual degrees of freedom, and the one in the infinite future, in terms of visible degrees of freedom. The discussion presented in [250] was applied to metaparticles (the zero modes of the metastring) in an expanding universe (such as de Sitter spacetime) and it indeed revealed that the dual degrees of freedom dominate in the early and young universe (when the visible sector is frozen), whereas in a large and old universe the dual degrees of freedom are frozen and the visible degrees of freedom dominate [250]. However, the same picture should be true for the metastring in a dS background.36\nWe stress that this proposal fits into our new understanding of de Sitter entropy as counting the degeneracy of the quantum vacuum of string theory [250]. This implies that the above Virasoro generators have to annihilate a degenerate modular vacuum [245]. That means that the dS entropy counts the degeneracy of two entangled theories with degenerate vacua, where the temperature of dS spacetime emerges after one of the theories (in the infinite future) is traced over. Note that the dual degrees of freedom are \u201cfrozen\u201d according to the general behavior of metaparticles in a cosmological background associated with an expanding universe, as the universe gets older and bigger, and thus, one could trace over the dual degrees of freedom, in an effective spacetime description. This, in turn, is consistent with how the effective cosmological constant emerges from a low energy description of the metastring framework, which will be discussed in the next section. Also, the new quantum number N introduced in Section 4, which is crucial for understanding how a small positive cosmological constant is realized in string theory, is the consequence of modular polarization. Therefore, the dual CFTs have to be quantized in the modular polarization in which this new\n36The same picture in principle applies to black holes in de Sitter spacetime, suggesting that the interplay of visible and dual degrees of freedom could be crucial for understanding the quantum dynamics of black holes, including the so-called information paradox. By extrapolation to zero cosmological constant, the same picture would apply to black holes in asymptotically flat spacetimes.\nquantum number is apparent. Similarly, dS observables should be defined in the modular formulation of quantum theory, given the fact that the Schro\u0308dinger polarization is generically singular from the modular spacetime point of view [245].\nOne of the most important new points here is that it was very difficult in the past to understand the appearance of CFTs with non-canonical conjugations for their Virasoro generators. Now however, such non-canonical CFTs are associated with the metastring formulation of string theory, and thus the physical picture, including the reason for the natural appearance of a small positive cosmological constant and a de Sitter background in string theory, is logically complete, at least conceptually.\nIn conclusion, given the new insight about the vacuum energy in string theory as presented in Section 4, one can approach the problem of de Sitter space in string theory in the context in which the vacuum energy problem has been understood, that is, in the framework of modular spacetime, and in particular, in the metastring formulation of string theory. However, even if we have a new insight on the vacuum energy problem and de Sitter space in the context of metastring theory (a duality symmetric and intrinsically non-commutative formulation of string theory) we need to understand how the \u201creal world\u201d emerges in such a de Sitter background with a naturally small cosmological constant."

The holographic definition of de Sitter space, based on non-canonical dual CFTs, and the new insights about the vacuum energy, also implies that string theory ought to be reformulated in a generalized-geometric fashion in terms of abstract CFT data.

            "text": "Strings have both left- and right-movers, both of which should in general be taken into account, and treated on the same footing \u2014 which is frequently not the case: In the usual spacetime interpretation, the sum of the left and right zero modes, xa:= 1\u221a 2 (xaL+x a R), are identified as the spacetime coordinates; the dual (winding) coordinates, x\u0303a:= 1\u221a 2 (xaL\u2212xaR) are, in typical textbook treatments, regarded as an afterthought if not outright ignored.37 However, by examining the simplest example of the canonical free string compactified on a circle, in an intrinsically T -duality covariant formulation of the Polyakov string, it was proven that these variables do not commute pair-wise [246,247]:\n[x\u0302a, \u02c6\u0303xb] = 2\u03c0i\u03bb 2\u03b4ab.

Also, this fundamental nonlocality is derived by examining the algebra of vertex operators in the 2d CFT of a free string compactified on a circle [83,84,242\u2013247].\nBorn Triple: As summarized in Section 4.3, one of the central features of this refinement is that the zero-mode variables XA def= (xa/\u03bb, x\u0303a/\u03bb)T span a phase-space like non-commutative, chirally doubled spacetime. Here, x\u0303a := \u03b4ab x\u0303 b uses the neutral metric \u03b7AB, and the Hilbert structure (i.e., the inner product) is captured by \u03c9AB, as specified in (4.25). These structures are usually ignored in the canonical spacetime interpretation of string theory. String theory (as a theory of quantum gravity) thus becomes that quantum theory whose intrinsic (Born) geometry of quantum non-locality is made dynamical. For more information about Born geometry encoded by the triple (\u03c9AB, \u03b7AB, HAB), see [91,158].\n37This coordinate doubling turns up, and most importantly, in the study of so-called twisted sectors in Landau-Ginzburg orbifold description of string compactification [334,335]. 38This fundamental, primordial length-scale, \u03bb, should not be confused with the 3+1-dimensional Planck length, (M (4)P ) \u22121 \u223c 10\u221235m: For example, the exponential hierarchy (3.12) in the axilaton models implies that \u03bb \u223c (M (10)P )\u22121 . 10\u221219m.\nIt is important to discuss the question of the physical meaning of (x\u0302a, \u02c6\u0303xb). Following the usual logic that connects the non-trivial commutators to the mutual indeterminacy of the non-commuting operators, we can understand the meaning of (x\u0302a, \u02c6\u0303xb), as follows: the x\u0302a coordinate can be associated with short-distance (UV) \u201cspacetime\u201d and the \u02c6\u0303xb with the long-stance (IR) \u201cspacetime\u201d, such that their corresponding indeterminacies are necessarily complementary, i.e.: \u2206xa\u2206x\u0303b \u223c \u03bb2\u03b4ab , as follows from (6.1). Furthermore, local effective fields \u03c6(x) should be replaced with bi-local fields \u03c6(x, x\u0303), leading to intrinsically non-commutative field theories. In turn, such theories generically display mixing between the UV and IR physics [87,336,337], and in order to define such theories in the continuum one has to appeal to a double-scale renormalization group (RG) and the self-dual fixed points. Therefore, the effective field theory scale does not have to be the UV scale, but some scale that is a geometric mean between the UV and IR scales (which should be compared to the discussion in section 4).\nBesides having a choice in the Hilbert space structure (that is, the inner product), this seems to be what is called for by the holographic formulation of de Sitter space: an intrinsic CFT formulation with the UV and IR cut-offs both explicitly taken into account. One of the issues associated with de Sitter holography was always that the parameter that defines the size of de Sitter spacetime is the observed cosmological constant, which is one of the explicit observables sensitive both to the UV and the IR physics. This appears as a parameter in the holographic formulation, which is not in principle tied to understanding its origin and naturalness. However, the generalized-geometric formulation offers in principle a new outlook on this fundamental problem.\nThis new approach to string theory suggest the natural unified theory of strings to be the bosonic string reduced on a 25+1-dimensional torus (but interpreted from a generalizedgeometric, quantum spacetime-based point of view, so that the usual puzzles associated with possible closed timelike curves etc. are avoided), and then \u201cextensified\u201d (this was the new concept used in [83,84,242\u2013247]). As suggested in these papers, the strongly coupled version of this fundamentally bosonic and non-commutative construction would then provide the proper definitions of the conjectured supersymmetric non-perturbative limits, that is, M - and F -theory.\nThis generalized geometric formulation of string theory originates from the chiral world-\nsheet (metastring) description (4.24):\nSchstr = 1\n4\u03c0 \u222b \u03a3 d2\u03c3 [ \u2202\u03c4XA ( \u03b7AB(X) + \u03c9AB(X) ) \u2212 \u2202\u03c3XAHAB(X) ] \u2202\u03c3XB, (6.2)\nwhere \u03a3 is the worldsheet, and XA, (A = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, 26, for the critical bosonic string) combine the sum (xa) and the difference (x\u0303a) of the left- and right-moving chiral bosons on the string. 39 The mutually compatible dynamical fields are the antisymmetric symplectic structure \u03c9AB,\n39This formulation also leads to a natural proposal for a non-perturbative string theory which will be\ndiscussed in a latter part of this section. Here we concentrate on the perturbative metastring formulation.\nthe symmetric polarization metric \u03b7AB and the doubled symmetric metric HAB, respectively, defining the so-called Born geometry [242]. For orientation and omitting torsion, Bab, the fundamental triple, (\u03b7AB, HAB, \u03c9AB) defined in (4.25), specifies respectively the neutral metric, the doubled spacetime metric and the symplectic structure of the flat metastring chirally doubled target XA-space. These easily define the following key tensors:\n(I := \u03c9\u22121H)AB = ( 0 \u2212hab hab 0 ) , I2 = \u22121; (6.3a)\n(J := \u03b7\u22121H)AB =\n( 0 hab\nhab 0\n) , J2 = +1; (6.3b)\n(K := \u03b7\u22121\u03c9)AB =\n( \u2212\u03b4ab 0\n0 \u03b4a b\n) , K2 = +1. (6.3c)\n[I, J ] = 2K, [K, I] = 2J, [J,K] = \u22122I; {J, I} = {I,K} = {K, J} = 0. (6.3d)\nThese provide the XA-space with a simultaneous complex (I), chiral (J) and real (K) structure.40 These structures straightforwardly generalize to curved XA-spacetime models, and the inclusion of the stringy Bab-field even provides for torsion; see (6.8), below.\nQuantization renders the doubled \u201cphase-space\u201d operators X\u0302A = (x\u0302a/\u03bb, \u02c6\u0303xa/\u03bb) inherently non-commutative, inducing [242]\n[X\u0302A, X\u0302B] = i\u03c9AB. (6.4)\nIn components and for constant non-zero \u03c9AB, as in (4.25), (6.4) is equivalent to:\n[x\u0302a, \u02c6\u0303xb] = 2\u03c0i\u03bb 2\u03b4ab , [x\u0302 a, x\u0302b] = 0 = [\u02c6\u0303xa, \u02c6\u0303xb], (6.5)\nwhere \u03bb denotes the fundamental length scale, such as the Planck scale \u2014 in the original, 9+1-dimensional setting. Then, = 1/\u03bb is the corresponding fundamental energy scale and the string tension is \u03b1\u2032 = \u03bb/ = \u03bb2. Note that the Hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constrains,\n\u2202\u03c3XAHAB\u2202\u03c3XB = \u03bb\u22122 [ gab(x, x\u0303) (\u2202\u03c3x a)(\u2202\u03c3x b) + gab(x, x\u0303) (\u2202\u03c3x\u0303a)(\u2202\u03c3x\u0303b) ] = 0, (6.6)\n\u2202\u03c3XA\u03b7AB\u2202\u03c3XB = 2\u03bb\u22122 [ (\u2202\u03c3x a)(\u2202\u03c3x\u0303a) ] = 0, (6.7)\nrespectively, are treated on the equal footing. In particular, the usual spacetime interpretation of the zero mode sector of string theory [13] is tied to the solution of the diffeomorphism constraint (6.7) by level matching.\n40Alternatively, 12{iI, iJ, iK} generate the so(2, 1) Lie algebra. In turn, the ordered triple {I, iJ, iK} of mutually anticommuting complex structures satisfy the quaternionic product algebra, e\u03b1\u00b7e\u03b2 = \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 e\u03b3 .\nNote that in the B-background the commutators read\n[x\u0302a, x\u0302b] = 0, [x\u0302a, \u02c6\u0303xb] = 2\u03c0i\u03bb 2\u03b4ab, [\u02c6\u0303xa, \u02c6\u0303xb] = \u22124\u03c0i\u03bb2Bab. (6.8)\nThis provides a new interpretation to the antisymmetric B-field, as essentially stemming from the non-trivial symplectic structure of general string theory, after an O(D,D) transformation. Similarly, there is a conjugate background (called \u03b2-background) characterized by the commutation relations:\n[x\u0302a, x\u0302b] = 4\u03c0i\u03bb2\u03b2ab, [x\u0302a, \u02c6\u0303xb] = 2\u03c0i\u03bb 2\u03b4ab, [\u02c6\u0303xa, \u02c6\u0303xb] = 0, (6.9)\nwhich reveal genuine non-commutativity of spacetime in string theory. Indeed, the direct non-commutativity in the observable spacetime as seen in (6.9) is exactly of the kind that has been discussed in \u201cnon-commutative quantum field theory,\u201d and which exhibits a priori measurable violations of Lorentz symmetry [338]. It is thus worthwhile noting that such studies have a \u201chome\u201d within the metastring/metaparticle framework, and are related to the B-background via the (6.9) vs. (6.8) gauge choice of sorts.\nIn this more general and generically non-commutative chiral formulation, the spacetime interpretation is replaced by a modular spacetime (or quantum spacetime) realization (also found in the context of quantum foundations) [242]. Also, all effective fields must be regarded a priori as bi-local \u03c6(x, x\u0303) and non-commutative, subject to (6.5), and therefore inherently non-local in the conventional xa-spacetime [242]. Such non-commutative field theories [336] generically display a mixing between the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) physics with continuum limits defined via a double-scale renormalization group (RG) and the self-dual fixed points [242, 336]. This has profound implications for the generic physics of string theory, and in particular the problems of dark energy, dark matter and the separation of scales. Thus, an effective field theory limit based on the traditional spacetime interpretation of string theory is simply not generic, but an exceptional and singular limit of this more general, non-commutative chiral formulation.\nThe underlying reason for the phase-space like non-commutativity in the general formulation of string theory may also be seen as follows: In the canonical presentation of string theory, say, compactified on a circle, one assumes that the coordinates and their duals commute, and one consequently finds that the algebra of vertex operators contains cocycles. Such cocycles are simply ubiquitous in string theory. The closer analysis of the underlying symplectic structure finds that these cocycles are simply place-holders for a noncommutative formulation [246,247]: The coordinates and their duals do not commute (6.5), but form a Weyl-Heisenberg-algebra, and the vertex operators form a representation this Weyl-Heisenberg algebra \u2014 now without cocycles. The usual spacetime formulation of strings is therefore simply a singular limit of this generic non-commutative and doubled, phase-space like, formulation. In essence, standard textbook presentation of string theory expands around a commutative limit of this intrinsically non-commutative formulation. This\nsingular limit is very similar to the so-called Seiberg-Witten limit of non-commutative field theory [86], where the physical observables must be identified with great care. Analogously, the physical observables in this general, non-commutative closed string theory must be identified as representations of the underlying non-commutative algebra.\nSimilarly, backgrounds like the B- and the \u03b2-background, respectively (6.8) and (6.9), are found to be part of the symplectic structure of the non-commutative phase-space like formulation, and that the dilaton naturally comes from the the volume preserving transformations of this underlying phase space. The geometry of this formulation is Born geometry which unifies the symplectic and doubly orthogonal transformation with the natural double metric. This geometry turns out to be the underlying geometry of quantum theory in its modular spacetime polarization, in which the symplectic structure captures the discrete phase space of the underlying spacetime and its dual, the orthogonal structure is the symmetry of this doubled spacetime, and the doubled metric structure is related to the choice of quantum vacuum in this generic modular polarization.\nThis implementation of Born geometry is the consequence of the compatibility of the fundamental length/time (non-locality) with Lorentz symmetry (causality) which are the deep reasons behind quantum theory. String theory (in its general formulation) is a very particular quantum theory in which this Born geometry is dynamical. Thus the road from quantum theory to string theory, viewed as a theory of quantum gravity, is analogous to the road taken from special to general relativity. Finally, the natural habitat of string theory is modular spacetime, as a precise form of quantum spacetime. The observed classical spacetime is only an emergent feature (extensification) of this quantum spacetime. Also, instead of the procedure of quantization of classical formulations, we should properly start from an intrinsic quantum formulation (modular polarization, given by a complete set of unitary operators of translation and dual translation), and then look for various consistent classical limits.\nWe emphasize the trade-off between a stable non-commutative (symplectic) bosonic picture of general string theory (and thus not the traditional bosonic picture with instabilities) and the traditional stable supersymmetric picture. In some sense we have a trade-off between the symplectic and complex structures (reminiscent of mirror symmetry).\nBorn Dynamics: In view of the preceding discussion regarding the generic formulation of string theory and its relation to the problem of dark energy and dark matter, in the remainder of this section we discuss a proposal for a non-perturbative formulation of string theory (and its M -theory and F -theory avatars). Indeed, the metastring offers such a new view on the fundamental question of a non-perturbative formulation of quantum gravity [242] by noting the following: In the metastring formulation the target space is found to be a modular space (quantum spacetime), but the same can be also said of the world-sheet. If the world-sheet is made modular in the metastring formulation, by doubling of \u03c4 and \u03c3, so that X(\u03c4, \u03c3) can\nbe in general viewed as an infinite dimensional matrix (the matrix indices coming from the Fourier components of the doubles of \u03c4 and \u03c3), then the corresponding metastring action\nbecomes \u222b Tr [ \u2202\u03c4XA\u2202\u03c3XB(\u03c9AB + \u03b7AB)\u2212 \u2202\u03c3XAHAB\u2202\u03c3XB ] d\u03c4 d\u03c3, (6.10)\nwhere the trace is over the matrix indices. Then we could associate the natural partonic degrees of freedom with matrix entries. We arrive at a non-perturbative quantum gravity by replacing the sigma derivative with a commutator involving one extra X26 (with A = 0, 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, 25). (Note that the idea that the canonical world-sheet of string theory might become non-commutative in a deeper, non-perturbative formulation, was suggested in [339].)\n\u2202\u03c3XA \u2192 [X26,XA]. (6.11)\nThis dictionary suggests the following fully interactive and non-perturbative formulation of metastring theory in terms of a (M -theory-like) matrix model form of the above metastring action (with a, b, c = 0, 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, 25, 26 )\u222b Tr [ \u2202\u03c4Xa[Xb,Xc]\u03b7abc \u2212Hac[Xa,Xb][Xc,Xd]Hbd ] d\u03c4, (6.12)\nwhere the first term is of a Chern-Simons form and the second of the Yang-Mills form, and \u03b7abc contains both \u03c9AB and \u03b7AB. This is then the non-perturbative \u201cgravitization of the quantum\u201d [242]. We remark that in this non-perturbative matrix theory like formulation of the metastring (and quantum gravity), the matrices emerge from the modular worldsheet, and the fundamental commutator from the Poisson bracket with respect to the dual world sheet coordinates (of the modular/quantum world sheet) \u2014 that is, quantum gravity \u201cquantizes\u201d itself, and thus quantum mechanics originates in quantum gravity. (However, this formulation should be distinguished from Penrose\u2019s \u201cgravitization of the quantum\u201d and gravity-induced \u201ccollapse of the wave function\u201d [340]. Also note some similarity of the metastring formulation, in its intrinsic non-commutative form, to the most recent proposal by Penrose regarding \u201cpalatial\u201d twistor theory [341].41)\nWe also note that the essential points regarding the phase space, non-commutative formulation of string theory have been already suggested in the well known work by Atick and Witten in 1988 [339].\n41Note that the bosonic string can be rewritten in terms of twistors [342]. This formulation can be generalized to include not only the original algebra of twistors, but also the \u201cpalatial twistor algebra\u201d in which the same doubled Heisenberg algebra of metastring theory appears. This formulation might be also useful in elucidating the nature of the algebraic structure that replaces supersymmetry in the general noncommutative phase-space like formulation of string theory. Note that twistors can be viewed as complex phase-space coordinates for massless degrees of freedom, and that they are, in some sense, also naturally related to supersymmetry (but without supersymmetry). In turn, this relation should be tied to the relevance of the phase space structure in the context of Born geometry [158], and especially the uniqueness of the connection in Born geometry.\nIn thinking about non-perturbative matrix model formulations of string theory it is natural to invoke the IIB matrix model [343], based on D-instantons as well as the matrix model of M -theory [273], based on D0-branes. However, these matrix models lack very important covariant properties associated with F -theory and M -theory. In our proposal we can do better. Given our new viewpoint we can suggest a new covariant non-commutative matrix model formulation of F -theory, by also writing in the large N limit\n\u2202\u03c4XC = [X,XC ], (6.13)\nin terms of commutators of two (one for \u2202\u03c3XC and one for \u2202\u03c4XC) extra N \u00d7N matrix valued chiral X\u2019s. Notice that, in general, we do not need an overall trace, and so the action can be viewed as a matrix, rendering the entire non-perturbative formulation of F -theory as purely quantum in the sense of the original matrix formulation of quantum mechanics by Born-Jordan and Born-Heisenberg-Jordan [344]\nSncF = 1\n4\u03c0 [Xa,Xb][Xc,Xd]fabcd, (6.14)\nwhere instead of 26 bosonic X matrices one would have 28, with supersymmetry42 emerging in 10(+2) dimensions from this underlying bosonic formulation. Thus, in this formulation one can realize the SL(2, Z) symmetry of IIB string theory. In this non-commutative matrix model formulation of F -theory, in general, fabcs(X) is a dynamic background, to be determined from the matrix analogue of the vanishing of the relevant beta function. By T -duality, the new covariant M -theory matrix model reads as\nSncM = 1\n4\u03c0 \u222b \u03c4 ( \u2202\u03c4Xi[Xj,Xk]gijk \u2212 [Xi,Xj][Xk,Xl]hijkl ) , (6.15)\nwith 27 bosonic X matrices, with supersymmetry emerging in 11 dimensions. Once again, the backgrounds gijk(X), and hijkl(X) are fully dynamicals, and they should be determined by a matrix-analogue of the Renormalization Group (RG) equation, and the vanishing of the corresponding beta function.\nNote the possibility of fundamental time asymmetry in this formulation. This is due to the cubic nature of the first term, and it is rooted in the fundamentally chiral nature of the worldsheed description of metastring theory. Such fundamental time asymmetry must be important for the fundamental cosmological problems, such as the fine tuning of the initial state, as well as the problem of matter-antimatter asymmetry.\nThe fundamental equations of the metastring are self-dual, and using the large-N prescription \u2202\u03c4XC = [X,XC ], we have the general form of Nahm\u2019s equations [345\u2013347], which in turn lead to the fundamental equations of Nambu quantum theory [348,349]. This would be a concrete implementation of the idea of \u201cgravitizing the quantum\u201d that is naturally implied\n42More precisely, this should be a \u201cre-bosonized\u201d preimage of supersymmetry in line with the sketch (6.37)\u2013\n(6.39) of the heterotic string model.\nby this proposal for a non-perturbative formulation of quantum gravity in the guise of string theory. The chiral formulation of the metastring has to be reflected in the choice of matrices \u2014 skew-symmetric or anti-Hermitian matrix. This should be an important point, especially in connection with the covariant formulation of Matrix theory or M -theory in 11d.\nNote that in this approach holography [350, 351] (such as AdS/CFT [296\u2013298], which can be viewed as a \u201cquantum Jarzynski equality on the space of geometrized RG flows\u201d [352,353]) is emergent in a particular semi-classical \u201cextensification\u201d of quantum spacetime, in which the dual spacetime degrees of freedom are also completely decoupled. The relevant information about \u03c9AB, \u03b7AB and HAB is now contained in the new dynamical backgrounds fabcd in F -theory, and gijk and hijkl in M -theory. This proposal offers a new formulation of covariant Matrix theory in the M -theory limit [348,354\u2013356], which is essentially a partonic formulation \u2014 strings emerge from partonic constituents in a certain limit. This new matrix formulation is fundamentally bosonic and thus it is reminiscent of bosonic M -theory [357]. The relevant backgrounds gijk and hijkl should be determined by the matrix RG equations. Also, there are lessons here for the new concept of \u201cgravitization of quantum theory\u201d as well as the idea that (observer dependent) dynamical Hilbert spaces or 2-Hilbert spaces (here represented by matrices) are fundamentally needed in quantum gravity [358\u2013360, 360\u2013363]. This matrix like formulation should be understood as a general non-perturbative formulation of string theory. In this partonic (quantum spacetime) formulation closed strings (as well as branes) are collective excitations, in turn constructed from the product of open string fields. Similarly, our toy model can be understood as a collective excitation in this more fundamental \u201cpartonic\u201d formulation. The observed classical spacetime emerges as an \u201cextensification\u201d [242], in a particular limit, out of the basic building blocks of quantum spacetime. Their remnants can be found in the low energy bi-local quantum fields, with bi-local (metaparticle) quanta, which were a motivation for our discussion of dark matter in string theory.\nFinally, it is an old realization that the 10d superstring can be found as a solution of the bosonic string theory [364]. This is precisely what we have in our proposed non-perturbative formulation. (Such a bosonic formulation is also endowed with higher mathematical symmetries, as already observed in [365].) Supersymmetry (in the guise of M - and F -theory) is emergent from our non-perturbative and seemingly entirely bosonic formulation in a similar fashion. This might allow us to go around some obvious problems raised by the apparent falsification of supersymmetry at the observable LHC energies.\nA comment regarding our toy model: Given the fact that our toy model can be understood as a non-holomorphic deformation of D7-branes in IIB string theory, we can imagine that D7-branes emerge as bound states of \u201cmonads\u201d (partons of our non-perturbative formulation of IIB string theory) in the supersymmetric limit. Thus, in the general, non-supersymmetric case, such initial D7-brane bound states get deformed into our cosmic-brane co-dimension two solutions in six dimensions, times a stable K3. Our toy model can be also understood by starting from a stringy cosmic string, which is supersymmetric, after supersymmetry is broken in a very particular way. From the point of view of string theory, the world sheet\ndescription can be understood as an effective string theory formulation that goes back to Polchinski and Strominger [366]. The leading order quadratic terms in that formulation, can be rewritten following the metastring prescription, that is in a chiral, doubled and intrinsically non-commutative form. Thus our axilaton model can be understood as an effective string theory, accompanied by effective Born geometry, and therefore, can be related directly to the above discussion of general string theory."

            "text": "In our recent papers [264, 367] we have argued that the generalized geometric formulation of string theory discussed above provides for an effective description of dark energy that is consistent with a de Sitter spacetime. This is due to the theory\u2019s chirally and noncommutatively (6.5) doubled realization of the target space and the stringy effective action on the doubled non-commutative (6.5) spacetime (xa, x\u0303a) (where we also include the matter Lagrangian Lm)\nSnceff =\n\u222b\u222b Tr \u221a g(x, x\u0303) [ R(x, x\u0303) + Lm(x, x\u0303) + . . . ] , (6.16)\nwhere the ellipses denote higher-order curvature terms induced by string theory (and where the corresponding Planck lengths are set to one). This result can be understood as a generalization of the famous calculation by Friedan [24]. Dropping the matter Lagrangian for now, to lowest (zeroth) order of the expansion in the non-commutative parameter \u03bb of Snceff takes the form (4.47) in d observed spacetime dimensions. This is a striking result which first was obtained almost three decades ago by Tseytlin [88\u201390], effectively neglecting the intrinsic non-commutativity of general string theory and thus \u03c9AB in (6.4), and by assuming that [x\u0302, \u02c6\u0303x] = 0 [88\u201390]. In general the observed spacetime and its dual are correlated, which should be important for phenomenology, but to first order in the fundamental length we will treat them as independent sectors.\nIn particular, in the leading limit, the x\u0303-integration in the first term of (4.47) defines the gravitational constant GN , and in the second term produces a positive cosmological constant \u039b > 0. Hence, the weakness of gravity is determined by the size of the canonically conjugate dual space, while the smallness of the cosmological constant is given by its curvature. In particular we have:\nS\u0304 =\n\u222b X \u221a \u2212g(x) [ R(x) + . . . ]\u222b X \u221a \u2212g(x) + . . . (6.17)\nwhich leads to a seesaw-like formula for the cosmological constant, discussed below. Note that if we include the matter sector explicitly we can argue that the dual part of the matter sector appears as dark matter, which is in turn both sensitive to dark energy [261\u2013263, 368\u2013374] and also dynamically correlated with the visible matter. One outstanding feature of this approach is the unity of the description of the entire dark energy and matter sector, induced\nand determined by the properties of the dual spacetime, as predicted by this general, noncommutatively phase-space doubled formulation of string theory. We emphasize that our emergent cosmological constant is naturally small and radiatively stable, given the argument presented in section 4.\nNote also that our GN could vary by varying the volume of the dual spacetime. This can be connected to the efforts to resolve the H0 tension by effectively varying GN [375] and references therein. For a recent review of the H0 tension see [376]."

            "text": "In this subsection we stress that the observed hierarchy of scales, already discussed in Section 4, can be understood from the point of view of effective spacetime description of the metastring formulation, and that it also nicely meshes with the general features of our toy model, discussed in Section 3.\nIn general string theory (which is chiral and non-commutative), all effective fields must be regarded a priori as bi-local \u03c6(x, x\u0303) [242], subject to (6.5). Moreover, the fields are doubled as well, and thus for every \u03c6(x, x\u0303) there exists a dual \u03c6\u0303(x, x\u0303), as implied by the background field approach, discussed in the next subsection. These fields are in general correlated, due to their non-commutativity. However, to first order in the fundamental length, we can treat them as independent. Thus, in general, to lowest (zeroth) order of the expansion in the non-commutative parameter \u03bb of Snceff takes the following form (that also includes the matter sector and its dual), which generalizes equation (4.47) :\u222b\u222b \u221a g(x) g\u0303(x\u0303) [ R(x) + R\u0303(x\u0303) + Lm(A(x, x\u0303)) + L\u0303dm(A\u0303(x, x\u0303)) ] (6.18)\nHere the corresponding Planck lengths are set to one and the A fields denote the usual Standard Model fields, and the A\u0303 are their duals, as predicted by the general formulation of quantum theory that is sensitive to the minimal length (the non-commutative parameter \u03bb [242]). In the following subsection we will elaborate more explicitly on the dual matter degrees of freedom. Right now we are concerned with the generalization of the discussion summarized in the previous section.\nTherefore, after integrating over the dual spacetime, and after taking into account T -\nduality, equation (6.17) now reads\nS\u0304 \u2032 =\n\u222b X \u221a \u2212g(x) [ R(x) + Lm(x) + L\u0303dm(x) ]\u222b X \u221a \u2212g(x) + . . . (6.19)\nThe main point here is that the dual sector (as already indicated in the previous section) should be interpreted as the dark matter sector, which is correlated to the visible sector via the dark energy sector, as discussed in [261\u2013263, 368\u2013374]. Once again, we stress the unity\nof the description of the entire dark sector based on the properties of the dual spacetime, as predicted by the generic formulation of string theory (viewed as a quantum theory with a dynamical Born geometry) [242].\nLet us turn off the dynamical part of gravity and consider the hierarchy of scales in this\nformulation. First we have S0 = \u2212 \u222b\u222b \u221a g(x)g\u0303(x\u0303) [ Lm(A(x, x\u0303)) + L\u0303dm(A\u0303(x, x\u0303)) ] , (6.20)\nwhich leads to the following non-extensive action to lowest order in \u039b\nS\u03040 =\n\u222b X \u221a \u2212g(x) [ Lm(x) + L\u0303dm(x) ]\u222b X \u221a \u2212g(x) + . . . (6.21)\nafter integrating over the dual spacetime. This in turn implies a seesaw formula which involves the matter scale from the matter (and dark matter) part of the action and the scales related to the UV (Planck scale, MP ) and the IR (dark energy scale, M\u039b):\nM\u039bMP \u223cM2H . (6.22)\nwhere MH denotes the matter scale (the Higgs scale). This provides for the consistent relation \u00b5 \u223cM2H , where MH \u223c 1 TeV.\nIn general, the relation (6.22) is also implied by the diffeomorphism constraint of the metastring, which is controlled by the O(d, d) bi-orthogonal metric \u03b7, and which implies, in the limit of zero modes (and zero momenta) that EE\u0303 = \u00b5, where E is the energy scale in the observed spacetime, and E\u0303 is the energy scale in the dual spacetime, and \u00b5 is the new parameter, which could be chosen to the Higgs scale (at least for the vacuum). If we remember that the geometry of the dual spacetime is responsible for the origin of dark energy, then the dual energy E\u0303 can be set to the dark energy scale. Then the fundamental energy scale E in the observed spacetime is the Planck scale. The explicit mixing of the UV and IR scales in a fully covariant formulation, which is consistent with a properly defined continuum limit, is a quite unique feature of the metastring. This feature of the metastring should be contrasted with other approaches to the hierarchy problem which mix the UV and IR scales but which violate covariance, such as [377]. In particular, this discussion meshes nicely with the new view on the cosmological constant problem and its relation to the gauge hierarchy problem, presented in Section 4.\nTherefore, we have that the vacuum energy is given as\n\u03c10 \u223cM\u039b4 = (M2H MP )4 (6.23)\nand thus \u03c10 \u223c (10\u22123 eV)4, which is the observed value. Comparing the seesaw relation (6.23) with (3.16) shows that setting M\u039b 4 = \u039b4, MP = M4 and MH = M6 identifies these two relations perfectly. This confirms that this hallmark result was not an artifact of the simplicity\nof the Section 3 toy model, and lends support to identifying the Standard Model (Higgs) mass-scale, MH , with the 6d Planck scale, which is in that axilaton scenario close to the primordial mass-scale of the underlying string theory. All of this is consistent with a more detailed picture of the vacuum energy problem given in Section 4.\nAlso, as highlighted in our previous work, the effective action of the sequester type\n[81,82,378] can be argued to emerge in this discussion\u222b X \u221a \u2212g [ R 2G + s4L(s\u22122gab) + \u039b G ] + \u03c3 ( \u039b s4\u00b54s ) , (6.24)\nwhere L denotes the combined Lagrangian for the matter and dark matter sectors, \u00b5s is a mass scale and \u03c3( \u039b s4\u00b54s ) is a global interaction that is not integrated over [81,82,378]. This can be provided by our set up: Start with bilocal fields \u03c6(x, x\u0303) [242], and replace the dual labels x\u0303 and also \u03bb (in a coarsest approximation) by the global dynamical scale s \u223c \u2206x\u0303\u223c\u03bb2\u2206x\u22121. Also, normal ordering produces \u03c3. This then provides an effective realization of the sequester mechanism in a non-commutative phase of string theory. An important point here is that the low energy effective description of the generic string theory is, to lowest order, a sequestered effective field theory, and more generally, a non-commutative effective field theory [336] of a new kind, which is defined within a doubled RG, which is covariant with respect to the UV and IR cut-offs, and which is endowed with a self-dual fixed point [242]."

            "text": "In this subsection we discuss the dual matter degrees of freedom and the explicit appearance of dark matter in the general formulation of string theory [242]. The previous discussion looked at the stringy effective action to lowest order in \u03bb, neglecting the non-commutative aspects of the generalized geometric formulation of the string worldsheet (6.2). In order to see the effect of the leading order correction in \u03bb of(6.18), we consider the zero modes of Schstr.\nThe action for the zero modes of generalized string theory, the metaparticle action, is fixed by the symmetries of the chiral worldsheet in terms of the symplectic form \u03c9, the O(D,D) metric \u03b7 and the double metric H \u2014 the so-called Born geometry. Following the general results about the metastring formulation [242] and (4.18), it takes the form:\nSmp =\n\u222b d\u03c4 (p\u00b7x\u0307+ p\u0303\u00b7 \u02d9\u0303x+ \u03bb2p\u00b7 \u02d9\u0303p+Nh+ N\u0303d) (6.25)\nwhere the Hamiltonian constraint, fixed by the double metric, h = p2 + p\u03032 + m2, and the diffeomorphism constraint, fixed by the O(D,D) metric, is d = p\u00b7p\u0303 \u2212 \u00b5. These constraints are inherited from the quantization of chiral worldsheet theory. Finally, the symplectic structure fixes the \u03bb2p \u02d9\u0303p term. Note that m2 should not be confused with a mass of a particle excitation. In parallel with the usual discussion found in introductory chapters of textbooks\non quantum field theory one has to understand the representation theory of associated with the symmetries of the underlying Born geometry, and interpret m2 and \u00b5 in terms of the relevant Casimirs in the full representation theory of this description [250]. We are not going to pursue this question in what follows, but we alert the reader that \u00b5 is a new parameter not found in the context of the effective field theory description, while m2 can be interpreted as a particle mass only in a very degenerate limit in which p\u0303 = 0 and \u00b5 = 0.\nWe begin our discussion with a vector background, by shifting the momenta and the dual\nmomenta by the gauge field and its dual [242],\npa \u2192 pa + Aa(x, x\u0303), p\u0303a \u2192 p\u0303a + A\u0303a(x, x\u0303) (6.26)\nThese gauge fields have the usual Abelian gauge symmetries. Thus in the target space action for the gauge fields we end up with canonical Maxwellian terms (with the obvious index structure) plus a characteristic coupling inherited from the symplectic structure (which is clearly not present in the usual effective field theory approach)\u222b x,x\u0303 [ F 2 \u2212 a\u03bb2[[A,A\u0303 ]] + F\u0303 2 + FF\u0303 + . . . ] (6.27)\nand where the \u03bb2[[A,A\u0303 ]] term is induced directly from the \u03bb2p \u02d9\u0303p-term in (6.25) by the \u201cminimal coupling\u201d shift (6.26), and its dimensionful coefficient a will be determined in what follows. This \u201cmixing\u201d term (which is not present in the effective field theory action) may be expressed as:\n[[A,A\u0303 ]] def = \u222b \u03c4 \u03c4\u2217 d\u03c4 \u2032 A(x(\u03c4 \u2032)) dA\u0303(x\u0303(\u03c4 \u2032)) d\u03c4 \u2032 , (6.28)\n= 1 2\n[ A(x)A\u0303(x\u0303) ]\u03c4 \u03c4\u2217 + 1 2 \u222b \u03c4 \u03c4\u2217 d\u03c4 \u2032 [ A(x(\u03c4 \u2032)) dA\u0303(x\u0303(\u03c4 \u2032)) d\u03c4 \u2032 \u2212 dA(x(\u03c4 \u2032)) d\u03c4 \u2032 A\u0303(x\u0303(\u03c4 \u2032)) ] . (6.29)\nThe first of these includes a (worldline-local) mixing term, together with its value at some \u201creference\u201d proper time, \u03c4\u2217, the integral of which evaluates in (6.27) merely to an additive constant and so is irrelevant. The second part, [A \u02d9\u0303A\u2212 A\u0307A\u0303], is far more interesting, as it provides a telltale \u201cangular momentum\u201d-like coupling of (A, A\u0303)-pairs to corresponding \u201cexternal/background\u201d fluxes, represented here by the coefficient \u201ca\u03bb2.\u201d This relies on identifying A, A\u0303 as canonical coordinates in the target-spacetime (classical) field theory. Alternatively, in the underlying worldsheet quantum field theory, the A, A\u0303 are coefficients of certain quantum states, for which then the [[A,A\u0303 ]]-term likewise accompanies a Berry-phase like quantity.\nThe above integral looks very much like the Bohr-Sommerfeld \u222b p dq integral, and which, apparently, also gets quantized in our case, if we plug this integral in the whole path integral. Bohr-Sommerfeld (semiclassical) quantization has physical consequences: quantization of classical energy levels etc. So, it is natural to expect something similar in our case. First\nthe fields and their duals are \u201ccanonically conjugate\u201d like q and p. Second, the fields and their duals exist only in certain state configurations, at least to first order in the appropriate quantization parameter. This reasoning goes beyond the rules of effective field theory.\nIn this sense, the dual particles are conjugate to the Standard Model particles in analogy with the canonical fact that momenta p are conjugate to coordinates q. That is, the dual fields do not commute with Standard Model fields, and the two form an effective Heisenberg algebra. Naturally, that target-space/field-space \u201ccanonical conjugateness\u201d is induced from the domain-space canonical commutation relation between x and x\u0303. That is the \u201cdomainspace\u201d symplectic structure induces a symplectic structure in the target space. This is \u201cobvious\u201d if one thinks of the target space as being \u201cgenerated\u201d by the fields (as their vevs, after a choice of an action and path integral). Thus the actual canonical conjugateness of \u201cp\u201d and \u201cq\u201d induces a conjugateness between any given function f(p) and certain special function g(q). In our case, the \u201cspecialness\u201d of A\u0303(x\u0303) as related to A(x) is that they both stem from the same bi-local function A(x, x\u0303).\nNote the relevance of the very light dual degrees of freedom in the observed spacetime in connection with the H0 tension, which could be resolved by changing the effective number of light dark matter degrees of freedom \u2014 dark radiation. Such light degrees of freedom could be provided by the dual degrees of freedom that are natural in our discussion. However, we also note that the vacuum structure of the full metafield description goes beyond the background field description used in this section [250].\nWe note that in the Coulomb gauge (and its dual), the action (6.27) becomes:\u222b x,x\u0303 [ (\u2202A)2 \u2212 a\u03bb2[[A,A\u0303 ]] + (\u2202\u0303A\u0303)2 + \u2202A \u2202\u0303A\u0303+ . . . ] . (6.30)\nOn the other hand, if we second-quantize the metaparticle action we should end up with the following structure fixed by Born geometry\u222b x,x\u0303 [ (\u2202A)2 + (\u2202\u0303A)2 \u2212 a\u03bb2[[A,A\u0303 ]] + (\u2202\u0303A\u0303)2 + (\u2202A\u0303)2 + \u2202A \u2202\u0303A\u0303+ . . . ] . (6.31)\nBy integrating over the dual spacetime (x\u0303), and by setting, for consistency, p\u0303 \u2192 0 in the observable 3+1-dimensional x-spacetime, we finally obtain (with indices on the respective gauge fields fully restored) [18]\u222b x [ (\u2202[aAb]) 2 \u2212 \u03bb4 2 L4 Fab[[Aa,A\u0303b ]] + (\u2202[aA\u0303b])2 + . . . ] , A\u0303a def = \u03b7ab A\u0303 b (6.32)\nThe effective length scale \u03bb4 relevant in the observed 3+1-dimensional x-spacetime indeed stems from the fundamental length-scale \u03bb from (6.5), but is rescaled by the restriction to the observable 3+1-dimensions \u2014 which may well involve an exponentially driven hierarchy, such as seen in (3.12). We have also introduced the size, L, of the observed 3+1-dimensional\nx-spacetime, whence its L4 is the scale of its 4-dimensional volume.43 Because the \u201cmixing\u201d term [[Aa,A\u0303 a ]] is properly normalized on the world-line, in spacetime it must be multiplied by the volume of spacetime, and so has to be rescaled by the volume of the observed spacetime, L4. This term is thereby sensitive both to the UV cutoff \u03bb4 and the IR cutoff L, both of which as induced for the observed 3+1-dimensional spacetime. Finally, the dimensionless quantity Fab encodes the Berry phase-like \u201cbackground fluxes.\u201d\nIn other words, in the 3+1-dimensional observable spacetime, one has both the visible sector and its dual/dark counterpart, coupled via this very particular \u201cmixing/correlation\u201d between the two, which is sensitive to both the UV and IR cutoffs. This correlation is invisible to effective field theory, and it vanishes as either \u03bb4 \u2192 0 or L \u2192 \u221e. This is consistent with the general set-up of the metastring which has two cutoffs (UV and IR) and which generically should be defined with self-dual RG fixed points. Note that this would mean that Standard Model of particle physics (of visible matter) has a dual counterpart (a dual Standard Model describing dark matter) and that these two are correlated, via the fundamental length. We remark that such a correlation between visible and dark matter involving an IR scale (in this case, the Hubble scale) has been observed in astronomical data and has been studied in the context of modified dark matter in [261\u2013263,368\u2013374]. However, the ratio \u03bb4 2/L4 should not be considered to be necessarily trans-Planckian as would be the case if \u03bb4 were the Planck length, and L the Hubble length. Instead, as already discussed in Section 6.3, these two scales are effective UV and IR scales in the observed 3+1-dimensional spacetime W 1,3, both of which depend on the details of how this W 1,3 \u201csits\u201d within the total 9+1-dimensional spacetime. This question has already arisen in Section 2.4, and we will return to it again in Sections 6.5. Still, the appearance of such scales is a direct evidence of the breakdown of effective field theory.\nWith the general idea for the vector fields Aa and A\u0303 a, the corresponding result for scalars\n\u03c6i and their duals \u03c6\u0303j [18] is immediate:\u222b x [ \u2016\u2202\u03c6\u20162 + \u2016\u2202\u03c6\u0303\u20162 \u2212 \u03bb4 2 L4 Fij[[\u03c6 i,\u03c6\u0303j ]] + . . . ]\n(6.33)\nas such terms would be forced in every dimensional reduction framework. Thus, a Higgs field would have a dual Higgs field and the two would be correlated via the fundamental length. Note that we could also consider pseudoscalars (axions) a and their duals a\u0303\u222b x [ (\u2202a)2 \u2212 \u03bb4 2 L4 [[a,a\u0303 ]] + (\u2202a\u0303)2 + . . . ] (6.34)\nOnce again, an axion field would be correlated to a dual axion field via the fundamental length scale. We should mention that axions can be viewed as \u201cboost generators\u201d (at least for constant profiles) between the observed and dual spacetimes [242]. This can be seen by\n43As seen in the toy model discussed in Section 3 and as will be discussed again below, different cosmological\nscenarios result in differing estimates for both \u03bb4 and L, so here we leave them unspecified.\nobserving that the constant Kalb-Ramond field can be absorbed into a non-trivial symplectic form (on its diagonal) after an O(d, d) rotation [242]. Thus the Kalb-Ramond two-form enters into an explicit non-commutativity of the modular spacetime, and it can be used to rotate between observed and dual spacetime coordinates (as an explicit illustration of relative, or observer-dependent, locality) [242]. The Kalb-Ramond two-form dualizes into a pseudoscalar in 4d, and thus the 4d axion has the same features. More generally, for nonconstant Kalb-Ramond profiles one ends up with a non-associative structure [242]. Therefore, in general, axions are indicators of non-commutative (when constant) and non-associative (when propagating) structures in modular spacetime.\nSimilarly, the corresponding action for the fermions (by taking the \u201csquare root\u201d of the\npropagating part of the scalar action to accommodate the spin-statistics theorem) [18]:\u222b x [ i(\u03c8\u0304/\u2202\u03c8) + i( \u00af\u0303\u03c8/\u2202\u03c8\u0303)\u2212 \u03bb4 3 L4 Fij ( [[\u03c8\u0304i,\u03c8\u0303j ]] + h.c. ) + . . . ] , (6.35)\nwhere [[\u03c8\u0304i,\u03c8\u0303j ]] = 1 2 (\u03c8\u0304i\u03c8\u0303j\u2212\u03c8\u0304j\u03c8\u0303i) are non-derivative bilinear terms, which couple to the same \u201cexternal\u201d fluxes as the bosons, akin to a worldline super-Zeemann effect [379]. The use of supersymmetry to relate (6.33) and (6.35) is justified as these are free fields in flat spacetime; it is the omitted interaction terms (including metric and curvature deviations from flat spacetime) that break supersymmetry. From the underlying (worldline, or even worldsheet [242]) point of view, such terms are induced from generalizing (6.25) along the by now standard GLSM construction [157,380]: Including additional, gauged symmetries and degrees of freedom as well as (super)potentials induces the interaction terms indicated by ellipses in (6.32), (6.33) and (6.35), and is classically equivalent to generalizing (6.25) into a nonlinear \u03c3-model. The \u201cfree-field-limit\u201d terms shown herein however remain unchanged.\nThe \u03bb4 3/L4 coefficient in the fermionic \u201cmixing\u201d term is forced on dimensional grounds, by the canonical 3/2 dimension for the fermion field. This term is quite explicitly a massmixing term, and may well induce a new type of a \u201cseesaw mechanism,\u201d perhaps even tunable to lead to naturally small neutrino masses. Also, the inclusion of several mass-scales enables concrete models to incorporate a hierarchy of \u201cseesaw mechanisms,\u201d with a more reasonable chance to approach the intricacies of a realistic mass spectrum. This relates back to our discussion at the very end of Section 4.9 and to the phenomenological studies [287\u2013289].\nTo summarize, the leading \u201ckinetic\u201d parts in the actions (6.33) and (6.35), together with the \u201cmixing terms,\u201d [[\u03c6,\u03c6\u0303 ]] and [[\u03c8\u0304,\u03c8\u0303 ]], are seen to be natural: (1) by dimensional reduction from (6.32) to (6.33), and (2) by supersymmetry from (6.33) to (6.35). In turn, the axilaton system [17] then induces supersymmetry breaking via the interaction terms, represented by the ellipses in (6.32), (6.33) and (6.35), which is not unlike the Polonyi mechanism [381]; for a recent discussion, see also [382,383].\nIn conclusion of this subsection, we note that the peculiar correlation between the visible and dark sectors, discussed for scalar, pseudoscalar, fermionic and vector degrees of freedom,\ncan be also found in the gravitational and dual gravitational sectors. Thus the observed gravity and dark energy are correlated via the scale of non-commutativity. This might have interesting observable effects for the so-called H0 tension [7], as discussed elsewhere [384]."

            "text": "In this section we comment on various phenomenological issues. The most important generic predictions of the generic string theory [242] is that the geometry of the dual spacetime determines the dark energy sector [264] and that the dual matter degrees of freedom naturally appear as dark matter degrees of freedom, as discussed in the preceding section. We note that, quite explicitly, the dark matter sector provides \u201csources\u201d for the visible matter sector. This follows from the coupling \u03bb4 2\nL4 [[\u03c6,\u03c6\u0303 ]], as predicted by the doubled/non-commutative set-\nup. This provides an explicit correlation between the dark matter sector and a visible sector via the fundamental length. Given the seesaw formula for the dark energy which relates the dark energy scale to the fundamental length, which could be taken to be the Planck energy scale, then the dark matter is also sensitive to the dark energy. So, the visible matter, dark matter and dark energy are all related. This is consistent with the observational evidence presented in [261\u2013263,368\u2013374], already alluded to in this review.\nWe emphasize that in our discussion of the hierarchy problem the UV and IR scales are radiatively stable, and so is their product, the Higgs scale. This new view on the hierarchy problem, that goes beyond the usual tools of effective field theory, because of the explicit presence of the widely separated UV and IR scales. The usual suggested approaches to the hierarchy problem: technicolor, SuSy and extra dimensions are all within the canonical effective field theory. In the context of string theory, effective field theory (and the approach to the hierarchy problem via a SuSy effective field theory) can be naturally found via string compactifications, but in that case one is faced with the issue of supersymmetry breaking (and the fundamental question of \u201cmeasures\u201d on the string landscape/swampland [3,5,104, 126, 385].) We claim that these issues are transcended in the general, chirally doubled and non-commutative formulation of string theory with a fundamentally bosonic and noncommutative formulation, in which spacetime and matter (as well as supersymmetry at the Planck scale) can be viewed as emergent phenomena.\nNext we comment on the seesaw formula, which mixes UV and IR scales, and the neutrino sector. Such a seesaw would involve the neutrino and its dual partner \u2014 the dual neutrino. Quite generically, the dual sector is the source for the visible sector and the overall effect is to make the visible sector essentially massive. If we could argue for such a formula, this would provide a new way of generating neutrino masses. Actually, this does provide a curious mixing \u201cmass\u201d effect \u2014 even if \u03bb4 3/L4 is very small. To see this, consider the well-known, standard diagonalization of a typical mass-matrix restricted to a fermion and\nits dual, [ m \u03bb43/L4\n\u03bb43/L4 m\u0303\n] :\n1 2\n[ (m+ m\u0303)\u00b1 \u221a (m\u2212 m\u0303)2 + 4(\u03bb43/L4)2 ] \u2248 {m+\u03b4m m\u0303\u2212\u03b4m, \u03b4m def =\n\u03bb4 6\nL8(m\u2212m\u0303) + . . . (6.36)\nWhat is worth observing is that the mixing contribution in \u03b4m is divided by the difference (m\u2212m\u0303), so that the mass-gap, 2\u03b4m, may well be phenomenologically relevant \u2014 even for a minuscule numerical value of (\u03bb4 3/L4)2. This clearly involves model-dependent details, and must be left to a case-by-case analysis.\nNext, we remark on other phenomenological issues associated with the dual Standard Model. In the dual QED sector, we should find a dual photon that is correlated to the visible photon, and that is distinct from the dark photon of effective field theory. The correlation is proportional to the fundamental length, and it finite even in the limit of zero momenta (deep infrared). Also, the usual visible photon/dark photon coupling is subdominant to this term that is inherent in our story. Similarly, in the dual of the weak sector of the Standard Model, we have a dual of the visible Z. This dual of Z should be distinguished from the usual Z \u2032 by its sensitivity to the fundamental length and by its correlation to the visible Z. These type of correlations might be found in correlated events in the accelerators, that are not products of any standard particle decays.\nAlso, in the dual QCD we should find interesting phenomenology in the deep infrared, even though that is a very difficult region to study in QCD. In particular, given the new view of the axion field in the above discussion, we have a novel and possibly useful viewpoint of the strong CP problem in QCD: The first observation here is that according to [242], the constant Kalb-Ramond field mixes x- and x\u0303-spacetimes (it acts as a boost that linearly combines the spacetime and its dual in the context of a larger doubled and non commutative quantum spacetime). Also the commutator of dual spacetime coordinates is given by the constant B Kalb-Ramond 2 form. So, for B = 0 we get just the observed (4d) spacetime. Also its H = dB field strength is trivially zero. But H is dual (in 4d) to the axion (a), which is also constant. But B is zero (there is no preferred background direction) and so this constant axion may be interpreted as a uniform distribution for the axion (whose constant values can be positive and negative). Now, let us assume that our axion a is the QCD axion, which is relevant for the strong CP problem. The CP violating term is proportional to the axion (aF \u2227F ). So, if we average this term which is linear in the axion over a uniform distribution for this axion we get zero ( \u222b k \u2212k da a = 0, with k \u2192\u221e). In order to complete this argument we would have to study small fluctuations of the axion field in order to understand the robustness of this new viewpoint on the strong CP problem.\nIn conclusion of this subsection, let us comment on the problem of inflation in string theory. It is known that string theory does not lead to natural slow-roll parameters (see [386]), and thus, inflation is somewhat problematic in string theory. On the other hand, it is known that the original Starobinsky inflation, which can be also viewed as an example of f(R)\ngravity (with a specific, and renormalizable, R2 term) does lead to very successful comparison with observation; see [387] and [388]). As is well known f(R) gravity can be rewritten as ordinary Einstein gravity coupled to a scalar field with a particular potential. Starobinsky\u2019s choice of the R2 terms leads to a very specific inflationary potential, the inflaton being that effective scalar field. Given that phenomenological success, various physicists have tried to connect Starobinsky inflation to particle physics, and in particular, to the Higgs sector, the Higgs field being the natural scalar degree of freedom in the standard model. This is the so called Higgs inflation approach [389]. However, there are problems with fine tuning, and the relation between the Higgs inflation and the Starobinsky inflation is not completely clear [389]. Now, given our discussion regarding the dual sector, the Higgs sector has a natural dual, and this dual scalar field (the dual Higgs) can provide for a natural inflaton, that leads to an effective Starobinsky-like inflation. The central reason here is that in the dual sector we have other parameters, and other scales that could be adjusted to yield the natural connection with the Starobinsky inflation. Therefore, another phenomenological avenue of our discussion, which also relates to the problem of de Sitter space (given the quasi-de-Sitter nature of the inflationary phase), is that the dual Higgs degree of freedom may serve as a Starobinsky-like inflaton. This has a reasonable chance of resolving the apparent tension between Starobinsky inflation and supersymmetry."

            "text": "The chirally doubled (26+26)-bosonic description of stringy target spacetime [83] may be adapted to discussing all stringy models, superstrings included, by reexamining the template of the partial and asymmetric (heterotic) fermionization [364,390\u2013392]; see also [314]. These standard constructions build around treating left- and right-moving degrees of freedom as completely independent and commuting, which is the \u03c9\u21920 (and so \u03bb\u21920) limit of the inherently non-commutative metastring [83, 84]. Via the relations xa:= 1\u221a\n2 (xaL+x a R) and\nx\u0303a:= 1\u221a 2 (xaL\u2212xaR), non-commutativity (6.5) implies that [xaL, xbR] = 2\u03c0i\u03bb2\u03b4ab.\nThe Standard Construction: In the \u03bb\u2192 0 limit, the construction of the heterotic string may be depicted by the following (standard light-cone restricted) diagram:\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\nxL YM: E8\u00d7E8 xR SuSy: TM+T \u2217M M (6.37)\nHere the 16 chiral bosons x10R , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, x25R , red-boxed in (6.37), are \u201cfermionized,\u201d and their dynamics is restricted so as to act as the on-shell 8+8 worldsheet (0, 2)-superpartners to the (x2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, x9), green-boxed in (6.37), in the light-cone gauge:({ x2L, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, x9L x2R, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, x9R } = { x2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, x9 x\u03032, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, x\u03039 }) SuSy\u2190\u2192 ({ x10R , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, x25R x10R , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, x25R } B F { \u03c82R, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, \u03c89R \u03c8\u03042R, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, \u03c8\u03049R }) . (6.38)\nThe so-formed eight worldsheet (0, 2)-supermultiplets, (x\u00b5|\u03c8\u00b5R, \u03c8\u0304\u00b5R) with \u00b5= 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, 9 explicitly omit using the corresponding x\u0303\u00b5 (pale blue in (6.38)). Regarding the target space in turn, the 2-component worldsheet Majorana-Weyl fermions, \u03c8\u00b5R (\u00b5 = 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, 9), and their Dirac conjugates, \u03c8\u0304\u00b5R, span the 8-dimensional spinor of the Lorentz light-cone subgroup SO(8) \u2282 SO(1, 9). Identified via SO(8) triality with SO(8)-vectors, these span the tangent and cotangent vectors at the target spacetime point indicated by the x\u00b5. Although highly nonlocal and nonlinear, the chiral boson to fermion transformation is a 1\u20131 mapping [393, 394]; see also [395\u2013398]. Correspondingly, the linear worldsheet supersymmetry has a correspondingly nonlinear and nonlocal \u201cre-bosonized\u201d preimage:( x\u00b5\n\u201cSuSy\u201d\u2190\u2192 (x\u00b5+8R , x\u00b5+16R )\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 M \u2194 TM+T \u2217M boson/fermion-ization\n) B F ( x\u00b5 SuSy\u2190\u2192 ( \u03c8\u00b5R[x \u00b5+8 R , x \u00b5+16 R ], \u03c8\u0304 \u00b5 R[x \u00b5+8 R , x \u00b5+16 R ] )) , (6.39)\ncomplete with a corresponding preimage of all supersymmetry features. In particular, this identifies/restricts {x10R , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, x25R } as spanning the tangent and cotangent space to the target (sub)spacetime, M , coordinatized by x\u00b5. While the existence of this identification is evident, its details remain to be worked out along [83,84], and compared with the various known supergravity constraints in the standard formalism. This metastring preimage of supersymmetry thus involves solitons, \u03c8\u00b5R and their Dirac conjugates, all of which are represented by exponential functionals [394].\nOn the other hand, the left-moving 16 chiral bosons x10L , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, x25L , blue-boxed in (6.37), are compactified on the E8\u00d7E8 (or SO(32)/Z2) lattice, and provide for the total of 496 massless YM-gauge degrees of freedom owing to the lattice-specified twisted boundary conditions. These 16 chiral bosons correspond to the simple positive roots of the gauge group, so that group elements are generated by these xL\u2019s, and are again represented by exponential functionals.\nThe chiral boson sketch (6.37)\u2013(6.39) is limited both to the \u201ctransverse\u201d degrees of freedom in the light-cone gauge, and that the worldsheet XL,R\u2019s were all originally assumed to be mutually commuting free fields, with but twisted boundary conditions and the identifications (6.37)\u2013(6.39) required for supersymmetry. As noted in [391] and explicitly shown in [10], the free field dynamics may be generalized to Ricci-flatness, which is consistent with the overall requirements [159\u2013162,164,165]. In such generalizations, the sketch (6.37)\u2013(6.39) can only be understood to represent local coordinates on any given chart on any topologically nontrivial (non-contractible) geometry.\nThis standard description thus not only omits the x\u0303\u00b5 (with \u00b5= 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, 9 outside the lightcone gauge) but relies on the commutative limit [xa, x\u0303b] = 2\u03c0i\u03bb2\u03b4ab \u2192 0 for all a= 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, 25.\nBorn Mirror-Doubling: However, [xa, x\u0303b] = 2\u03c0i\u03bb2\u03b4ab 6= 0, and this implies a specific structure to the geometry of the target spacetime.\nThe overall structure of the metastring target spacetime, M , is chirally doubled into an \u201calmost symplectic and para-Hermitian manifold\u201d44 that has a compatible foliation: Locally at every point, x, this doubled spacetime factorizes, Mx =Mx\u00d7x M\u0303x, the local coordinates for the two factors being (xa, x\u0303b)p [158], equipped with a phase-space like structure. For local diffeomorphisms (implemented by the Dorfman generalization of the Lie derivative) to be integrable to finite translations, it is necessary to impose the so-called \u201csection condition,\u201d which halves the spacetime akin to the quantum-mechanical restriction of the classical phase space, (p, q), in the coordinate or momentum representation \u2014 or indeed any other \u03c0 := (\u03b1p+\u03b2q)-polarization, as familiar from the Geometric Quantization program [399,400].\nIt is then a hallmark of this structure that \u03c0[TM ] = (T+T \u2217)\u03c0[M ]: the polarization of (the total space of) the tangent bundle on M is the generalized/doubled tangent bundle on a polarization of M . In local coordinates, elements of TM in the \u03c0x-polarization are given as va(x, x\u0303)\u2202a+wa(x, x\u0303)dx a, since x\u0303 are locally constant (\u2202\u0303a, dx\u0303a 7\u2192 0) on \u03c0x[M ] = Mx [158, Eq. (5.1)]. In turn, the same element is va(x, x\u0303)dx\u0303a+wa(x, x\u0303)\u2202\u0303 a in the \u03c0x\u0303-polarization, since on \u03c0x\u0303[M ] = M\u0303x\u0303 the x are locally constant (\u2202a, dxa 7\u2192 0). Thus, swapping the polarization Mx \u2194 M\u0303x\u0303 explicitly identifies TMx = T \u2217M\u0303x\u0303 and T \u2217 Mx = TM\u0303x\u0303 \u2014 which is the underlying premise of mirror symmetry. As Calabi-Yau manifolds (compact or not), M and M\u0303 additionally admit compatible complex structures and Ka\u0308hler Ricci-flat metrics. Whether these features are also guaranteed by Born geometry or merely compatible with it is an interesting but for now open question.\nThe Born geometry of the metastring (chirally and non-commutatively doubled) target spacetime thus explicitly includes mirror symmetry by virtue of having to \u201cpolarize\u201d on one half of the spacetime, such that polarizing on the complementary half swaps the corresponding tangent and cotangent spaces. This realization of mirror symmetry as T -duality seems rather more direct and automatic in the target spacetime than the earlier proposals [14,172].\nBorn Heterotic Strings: The foregoing realization may be applied to the heterotic Ansatz (6.37) by swapping the polarization in the factor spanned by the first third of fields, {xa, a6 9}, while adapting the roles of the remaining 2/3 of fields, {xaL,R, a> 10} as forced by Born geometry: For example, if say x\u00b5+8R were identified (by \u201cre-bosonized\u201d supersymmetry) to span TMx to Mx coordinatized by x \u00b5, then they must span T \u2217\nM\u0303x\u0303 to M\u0303x\u0303 coordinatized\nby x\u0303\u00b5. These relationships are sketched in Figure 4, which shows that this structure corroborates the argument presented in [17, \u00a7 5.1]. In Calabi-Yau compactifications, the spacetime spanned by {xa, a6 9} factors as Mx =R1,3\u00d7Y 6, where the polarization swapping is trivial on the R1,3-factor, but implements the nontrivial mirror symmetry on the Y 6 factor.\n44Such spaces admit a signature-(d, d) metric \u03b7 and a symplectic structure \u03c9 such that K := \u03b7\u00b7\u03c9 is an almost product structure, K2 = +1. This \u03b7 need not be flat, and \u201calmost\u201d means that \u03c9 need not be a closed 2-form. Owing to the almost symplectic structure, the existence of the corresponding flat (Bott) connection guarantees that a foliated space is everywhere locally a product of two half-dimensional affine spaces.\nRecalling that the original heterotic Ansatz (6.37) assumed the various free fields to be mutually commuting, and to a large extent mutually interchangeable, we consider here the following tripartite heterotic Ansatz,45 shown already with the Born-mirror identifications:\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\nx x\u0303\nWS light-cone coordinates on M light-cone TM = T \u2217 M\u0303 -fiber Simple pos. roots of E8\nlight-cone coordinates on M\u0303 light-cone TM\u0303 = T \u2217 M -fiber Simple pos. roots of E\u03038\n(6.40)\nIn particular, {x10, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, x17} and {x\u030310, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, x\u030317} are here identified by \u201cre-bosonized\u201d supersymmetry to span the indicated (co)tangent spaces to the chirally doubled space with the M>M\u0303 foliation. The non-commutative metastring framework and Born geometry then have the following immediate implications:\n1. The metastring metric, \u03b7AB|10\u00b7\u00b7\u00b717, reproduces the canonical fiber-wise pairing of the two canonical bundles: \u3008TM , T \u2217M\u3009=1= \u3008T \u2217M\u0303 , TM\u0303\u3009.\n2. The metastring metric, \u03b7AB|18\u00b7\u00b7\u00b725, implies a dual pairing between the E8\u2019s simple positive roots and those of E\u03038. This implies that the roots of E\u03038 are \u03b7-canonically reciprocal\nto those of E8 \u2014 which identifies E\u03038 as the Langlands dual, E \u2228 8 [401], i.e., the electromagnetic dual [402, 403]! Being simply laced, E\u22288 \u2248 E8, and they are physically indistinguishable. The E8-group elements are exponential functionals of the {x18, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, x25}, which can be arranged to commute [83,84] with the E\u03038-group exponential functionals of the {x\u030318, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, x\u030325}, realizing the standard E8\u00d7 E\u03038 Yang-Mills group, with [E8, E\u03038] = 0 as assumed in the original heterotic Ansatz [364,390\u2013392].\n3. As indicated in (6.40), for a = 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, 9 identify the light-cone gauge \u201cbase\u201d coordinates xa, x\u0303a and the light-cone gauge \u201cfibre\u201d coordinates xa+8 7\u2192dxa= \u2202\u0303a and x\u0303a+8 7\u2192\u2202a=dx\u0303a, and for a = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, 8 identify the simple positive roots (xa+17, x\u0303a+17) 7\u2192 (\u03c1a, \u03c1a\u0303). Then: (a) All target spacetime fields are a priori bi-local: they depend on both x\u00b5 and x\u0303\u00b5,\nwith \u00b5 = 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, 9. 45In the light-cone gauge, the initial variables x0, x1, x\u03030, x\u03031 are identified with the worldsheet (\u201cWS\u201d) coordinates, i.e., \u201clongitudinal.\u201d In this gauge, the coordinates transversal to the worldsheet are the physical degrees of freedom. In turn, this implies that the worldsheet itself should be coordinatized in this chirally doubled fashion for consistency.\n(b) They are valued as follows: A\u00b5 \u03b1 is an element of T \u2217M\u00d7E8, i.e., it is an E8-valued\n1-form on M . In turn, A\u00b5\u03b1\u0303 is valued in TM\u00d7E\u03038, so that A\u03b1\u0303\u00b5:=H\u00b5\u03bdA\u03bd\u03b1\u0303 is (via H\u00b5\u03bd-contraction) an E\u03038-valued 1-form on M .\nThese originally bi-local fields then give rise to both an E8-gauge field and its (\u201cdark\u201d) dual field valued in the same E8 algebra. Analogously developing the E\u03038-valued gauge fields, we have both the standard A\u00b5 \u03b1(x), A\u00b5 \u03b1\u0303(x), as well as their (\u201cdark\u201d) duals, A\u0303\u00b5 \u03b1(x\u0303), A\u0303\u00b5 \u03b1\u0303(x\u0303).\n4. The metastring non-commutativity correlates, via \u03bb4 2\nL4 \u222b x F\u00b5\u03bd[[A\u03b1\u00b5(x),A\u0303 \u03b2\u0303 \u03bd (x\u0303) ]]\u03b7\u03b1\u03b2\u0303, the\nstandard E8-fields and their dual \u201cdark\u201d E\u03038-fields, and of course analogously the standard and \u201cdark\u201d fields with E8 \u2194 E\u03038 swapped.\nFurther Remarks: A recent analysis of the conifold transition in the standard formulation of heterotic string theory indicates that \u201c[effective] field theory alone [. . . ] is likely not sufficient to describe the relevant singularities\u201d [120]. In turn, the diagram (6.37) indicates that the usual EFT approach indeed misses the (x\u03030, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, x\u03039)-dependent fields, i.e., the \u201cdark\u201d x\u0303-dependent fields \u2014 and then also their curvature (Chern class) contributions. Section 6.2 already showed that the overall curvature of the x\u0303-spacetime induces a cosmological constant, so too must then the dual, \u201cdark\u201d A\u0303\u00b5 \u03b1(x\u0303), A\u0303\u00b5 \u03b1\u0303(x\u0303) induce a previously unaccounted gaugebundle curvature, correlated via (6.32) and other above-enumerated relations. Whether this manifestly self-T -dual, chirally and non-commutatively doubled formulation affords a resolution to this decades-old puzzle and a physically complete description of conifold transitions for heterotic strings is a tantalizing, open question.\nFollowing the discussion in Section 6.4, the fundamental non-commutativity [xL, xR] 6= 0 also implies the existence of gauge-gravity correlation terms, \u03bb4 2\nL4 \u222b x Fab[[Aa,\u0393b ]]. (The linear\nmomentum of a charged particle is in curved spacetime modified both by the gauge potential, Aa, and by the Christoffel symbol/potential, \u0393a.) Such a coupling to background fluxes F ab seems closely related to the so-called \u03c0-fluxes of [247], which however explicitly involve the dilaton. Their consistent combination and possible cancellation, defining the critical case in which this assumption of the standard (6.37) heterotic string model [364, 390\u2013392] is also met, can only happen when gs\u223cO(1). Curiously, this coincides with the seemingly unrelated observation of \u2329 gDs \u232a\nY 2\u22a5 \u223c O(1) in Section 3.2. More importantly however, this implies that\nthe Born geometry of the metastring formalism, besides being inherently T -dual, also involves S-duality.\nAlthough undoubtedly technically demanding, there seem to be no insuperable obstacles to reverse-engineer the myriads of standard (super)string models into the metastring framework [83, 84]. In particular, the Born geometry of this chirally doubled, phase-space like noncommutative stringy target spacetime insures [91, 158] that it contains, in the commutative \u03c9, \u03bb\u21920 limit, both the formalism of \u201cdouble field theory\u201d [88\u201390,267,313\u2013324] as well as that\nof \u201cgeneralized (complex, Ka\u0308hler) geometry\u201d [318, 325\u2013333] \u2014 and so also their respective results, as well as indications towards leading \u03bb-corrections.\nStandard model: Finally, we remark on the relation of this new view of the heterotic string and the emergence of the particle physics Standard Model.\nThe non-commutative geometry of the Standard Model (SM) [404, 405] allows to place the Higgs field on the same footing with the gauge fields, thus fixing the Higgs sector. Our non-perturbative formulation of string theory allows for general non-commutativity and non-associativity, essentially because of the B and H fields in string theory. We want to emphasize that the uniqueness of the SM group from the point of view of a unique nonassociative quantum theory (see Gu\u0308rsey and Gu\u0308naydin\u2019s work [406, 407], reviewed in the book by Gu\u0308rsey and Tze [408]) meshes well with the general non-associativity of our nonperturbative formulation. Also, chiral fermions can arise from the self-dual lattice that gives a fermionic string from the underlying bosonic string formulation. In particular, the unique prediction of heterotic string theory which is constructed from bosonic string theory, the gauge group E8 can be related to the octonionic geometry (see the review of Baez on octonions and physics [409]), which in turn, upon \u201cintegrating out\u201d over one octonionic structure (compatible with the double nature of the non-perturbative formulation of bosonic metastring theory) reduces to octonionic geometry, the Moufang plane [408, 409], which is known to have the projective geometry of F4/ SO(9), and the unique subroup of SO(9) compatible with the Poincare group, being the Standard Model group SU(3)\u00d7SU(2)\u00d7U(1) (as observed by Gu\u0308rsey and Gu\u0308naydin). Thus the uniqueness of E8, via the non-associative octonionic geometry, could imply the uniqueness of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. We note that this type of reasoning transcends the domain of the canonical effective field theory and is complementary to it.\nIn particular, if the Standard Model gauge group appears from the unique non-associative structure, and then the non-commutative structure of the non-perturbative formulation forces one into the so-called non-commutative geometry of the Standard Model as discussed in [404,405] and [410,411] as well as [412\u2013416] then the question still remains: what physics is responsible for the masses and couplings of elementary particles and their interactions? One approach that fits the narrative reviewed in this article is \u201cthe Universe as an attractor\u201d approach in which the fundamental interactions vertex of string field theory, or the above non-perturbative formulation of metastring theory in terms of an abstract, doubled, non-commutative and non-associative matrix quantum theory, introduces an effective \u201chorizontal transfer of information\u201d that has been used in biological physics to argue for the universality of the genetic code, as reviewed in [146]. In that context one uses the mechanism of horizontal gene transfer to demonstrate convergence of the genetic code to a near universal solution. It is tempting to conjecture that a similar mechanism can be used to argue for a universal solution for particle masses and couplings. This also fits the idea of quantum contextuality (as opposed to anthropics) that was already mentioned in our dis-\ncussion of the vacuum energy problem. All this taken together with the realization of dark energy as the geometry/gravity of the dual spacetime [367], as well as dark matter as the metaparticle extension of the Standard Model presents a complete proposal for how, in principle, string theory, in its metastring formulation could describe a world with a small and positive cosmological constant together with the visible and dark matter sectors needed for the observed cosmological and particle physics structures."

            "text": "In this review we have discussed various aspects of de Sitter spacetime in string theory: its status as a spacetime solution, including a new view on the cosmological constant problem, its (global) holographic definition in terms of two entangled and non-canonical conformal field theories, and how a realistic de Sitter universe that includes the observed visible and dark sectors can be realized in string theory, formulated in an intrinsically non-commutative and generalized-geometric form. In particular, we argue that the doubled, non-commutative generalized-geometric formulation of string theory can lead to a positive cosmological constant. Essentially, the curvature of the dual space is the cosmological constant in the observed spacetime, and the size of the dual space is the gravitational constant in the same observed spacetime. Also, the three scales associated with intrinsic non-commutativity of string theory, the cosmological constant scale and the Planck scale, as well as the Higgs scale, can be arranged, to satisfy a seesaw-like formula. We also discuss various implications for dark matter, hierarchy problem as well as a new non-perturbative approach to string theory and quantum gravity. In particular, the vacuum energy of the string balances its phase space nature versus its holographic nature, in order to provide for a radiatively stable and technically natural cosmological constant. Also, we have emphasized that these new features of string theory can be implemented in a particular deformation of cosmic-string like models.\nThe foregoing indicates that looking for alternatives to de Siter space in string theory, such as in the form of quintessence (another effective field theory description), appears rather unnatural even by the very criteria of effective field theory [5,6]. Instead, one should look for cosmological signatures of the intrinsic non-commutativity of string theory and its generalized (Born) geometry. Such cosmological signatures can have both UV and IR guises, and their mixing. In particular, one should look for non-local effects at largest possible (Hubble) scale. A preliminary study of such non-local effects associated with a one-parameter vacuum structure of de Sitter space was discussed in [417\u2013419]. Similarly, effective non-commutativity in cosmology was discussed in [420] and the minimal length in [269,421,422]. However, such effects should be re-examined from the point of view of the non-commutative description of string theory discussed herein.\nFrom the empirical point of view, in order to test the proposal reviewed in this paper, one should search for metaparticles, test the crucial relation between the phase space and\nholographic aspects of the vacuum energy, and look for general quantum implications of a dynamical Born geometry of the metastring, such as \u201cgravitizing the quantum\u201d [284, 423]. Clearly, much work remains to be done to advance the ideas described in this review, and we look forward to discussing some of these developments in the future.\nAcknowledgments: Our very special thanks go to L.
