Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the commonly used delivery tools for messenger RNA (mRNA) therapy and play an indispensable role in the success of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Ionizable cationic lipids are the most important component in LNPs. Herein, we developed a series of new ionizable lipids featuring bioreducible disulfide bonds, and constructed a library of lipids derived from dimercaprol. LNPs prepared from these ionizable lipids could be stored at 4 ◦C for a long term and are non-toxic toward HepG2 and 293T cells. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the best C4S18A formulations, which embody linoleoyl tails, show strong firefly luciferase (Fluc) mRNA expression in the liver and spleen via intravenous (IV) injection, or at the local injection site via intramuscular injection (IM). The newly designed ionizable lipids can be potentially safe and high-efficiency nanomaterials for mRNA therapy. 1. conclusion, a library of 16 ionizable lipids containing disulfide bonds is established
via a 3-step synthetic procedure, which is cost-effective and time-saving. The preliminary
screening is completed by monitoring the size, PDI and stability of LNPs. The hydropho-
bic tail, including the double bond, is superior to the saturated alkyl chain. The leading
LNPs formulations C4S18A, which both embody linoleoyl tails, were identified by in vitro
screening. The LNPs were stable at 4 °C for 40 days and they showed minimal cell cyto-
toxicity, which is verified by CCK8 assays using 293T cells and HepG2 cells. When the
Fluc−mRNA-loaded LNPs prepared by C4S18A and C4AS18A were injected into mice,
our samples present excellent luminance intensity. These discoveries offer an alternative
to developing biodegradable and highly efficient nanocarriers for mRNA delivery. Fur-
ther study on the structure–functionality relationships of this kind of LNP is currently
underway.
