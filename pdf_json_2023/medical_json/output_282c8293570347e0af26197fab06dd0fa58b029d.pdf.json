    "abstractText": "Background Genome-wide sequencing may extensively identify potential pathogenic variants, which helps to understand mechanisms of tumorigenesis, but such study has not been reported in benzene-induced leukemia (BIL). Methods We recruited 10 BIL patients and conducted the whole-exome sequencing on their peripheral blood samples. The obtained sequencing data were screened for potential pathogenic and novel variants, then the variantslocated genes were clustered to identify cancer-related pathways. Shared or recurrent variants among the BIL cases were also identified and evaluated for their potential functional impact. Results We identified 48,802 variants in exons in total, 97.3% of which were single nucleotide variants. After filtering out variants with minor allele frequency \u2265 1%, we obtained 8667 potentially pathogenic variants, of which 174 were shared by all the BIL cases. The identified variants located in genes that could be significantly enriched into certain cancer-related pathways such as PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and Ras signaling pathway. We also identified 1010 novel variants with no record in the Genome Aggregation Database and in dbSNP, and one of them was shared by 90% cases. The recurrent and novel variant caused a missense mutation in SESN3. Conclusions We examined variations of the whole exome in BIL patients for the first time. The commonly shared variants implied a relation with BIL, and the recurrent and novel variant might be specifically related to BIL. The related variants may help unravel the carcinogenic mechanisms of BIL.",

The obtained sequencing data were screened for potential pathogenic and novel variants, then the variantslocated genes were clustered to identify cancer-related pathways. Shared or recurrent variants among the BIL cases were also identified and evaluated for their potential functional impact.\nResults We identified 48,802 variants in exons in total, 97.3% of which were single nucleotide variants. After filtering out variants with minor allele frequency \u2265 1%, we obtained 8667 potentially pathogenic variants, of which 174 were shared by all the BIL cases. The identified variants located in genes that could be significantly enriched into certain cancer-related pathways such as PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and Ras signaling pathway. We also identified 1010 novel variants with no record in the Genome Aggregation Database and in dbSNP, and one of them was shared by 90% cases. The recurrent and novel variant caused a missense mutation in SESN3.\nConclusions We examined variations of the whole exome in BIL patients for the first time. The commonly shared variants implied a relation with BIL, and the recurrent and novel variant might be specifically related to BIL. The related variants may help unravel the carcinogenic mechanisms of BIL.\nKeywords Benzene, Exome, High-throughput sequencing, Leukemia, Genetic variant"

Carcinogenicity of benzene was first established in 1982 based on definite evidence of animal experiments as well as epidemiological studies [1], and benzeneinduced leukemia (BIL) is diagnosed in China according to the current national criteria GBZ 94-2017 \u201cDiagnosis of Occupational Tumor\u201d [2]. Apart from exposure to *Correspondence: Dafeng Lin david1385@foxmail.com Naixing Zhang zhangnx@wjw.sz.gov.cn 1 Occupational Health Department, Shenzhen Prevention and Treatment Center for Occupational Diseases, 2019 Buxin Rd., Luohu District, Shenzhen 518020, China 2 Medical Laboratory, Shenzhen Prevention and Treatment Center for Occupational Diseases, Shenzhen 518020, China 3 Occupational Diseases Department, Shenzhen Prevention and Treatment Center for Occupational Diseases, Shenzhen 518020, China\nbenzene of over 6\u00a0mg/m3 for at least 6\u00a0months, the diagnosis requires a latent period of 2 or more years [2]. Besides, leukemia developed with a medical history of chronic benzene poisoning can be directly diagnosed as BIL [2]. Large cohort studies estimated that the incidence of leukemia among benzene exposure workers was 13.59 per 100,000, and the relative risk for all hematologic neoplasms combined was 2.6 (95% CI 1.4\u20134.7) [3, 4].\nIt was reported that about 80% of BIL were clinically classified as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and about 20% were acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) combined [5, 6]. We observed more CML in clinics than ALL. Both AML and CML are malignant bone marrow cancers showing the characteristic of abnormal growth of myeloid cells at different maturation stages. Clinically, CML can be classified into chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase (AP), and blast phase (BP) or blast crisis (BC) [7]. Although most CML patients remain in the CP which is relatively benign, their conditions will undesirably progress to the myeloid or lymphoid BP if left untreated. CML in BP is similar to AML, both of them show an increased frequency of blast cells, aggressiveness and poor prognosis [8]. The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) is a unique hallmark of CML cells, which results from the t(9;22)(q34;q11) chromosomal translocation and encodes a carcinogenic fusion protein BCR-ABL1, a tyrosine kinase with deregulated activity. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting BCR-ABL1 were developed 2\u00a0 decades ago to effectively treat CML [8]. Comparatively, AML was found to have at least 24 different genetic subtypes, suggesting quite more heterogeneous molecular features than CML [9, 10]. Until this day, cytotoxic chemotherapy is still the same standard treatment for AML as in half a century ago [8].\nThe key to develop more efficient cancer detection methods and therapeutic approaches is uncovering the mechanisms of tumorigenesis, which is considered primarily driven by genetic mutations [11]. Nowadays genetic studies have reached to the genome-wide scope at a single-base resolution thanks to the next-generation sequencing technologies. AML was among the first malignancies that had been extensively studied by novel high-throughput microarray and sequencing technologies [12]. After first reported in 2008, genomic studies in AML identified numerous novel recurrent somatic alleles, such as mutations in the DNA methyltransferase 3A gene (DNMT3A) and the isocitrate dehydrogenase genes (IDH1 and IDH2), and most of them were of biologic, prognostic, or therapeutic relevance [12]. As for CML, studies focused on detecting mutations in BCR-ABL1 gene, because the fusion gene plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CML, and mutations in it might engender failure of one or more of the\ncurrently effective TKIs [13]. Such reported mutations include T315I, Y253F/H, E255K, V299L and L237M, etc. (transcript ENST00000318560.6). [13]. Besides, studies also discovered mutations in ASXL1, DNMT3A, EZH2, RUNX1, TET2 and TP53 genes in the chronic phase of CML, and in CBL, CDKN2A, GATA-2, IDH1, IDH2, IKZF1, KRAS, NPM1, NRAS, RB1, RUNX1, TET2, TP53 and WT1 genes in the advanced phase [13, 14]. Unfortunately, there has been no genome-wide sequencing studies reported on BIL to date regardless of the clinical types.\nWhile being clinically heterogeneous, BIL has the same oncogenous origin, that is benzene exposure. Whether there are shared (or recurrent) genetic variants among the BIL patients is still unknown to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, if the putative variants were specific to BIL and/or had potential impact on biological structures or functions, they would be quite valuable for further studies on carcinogenic mechanisms. Intrigued by the aforementioned hypothesis, we tentatively recruited 10 BIL patients and conducted the whole-exome sequencing (WES) on their peripheral blood samples. The sequencing data were first screened for potential pathogenic variants by using a cutoff value of minor allele frequency (MAF) < 1%, and then screened for novel variants by excluding those recorded in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) and in Database of Short Genetic Variation (dbSNP). The pathogenic variants- and the novel variants-located genes were separately evaluated using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database to identify cancer related pathways. Thereafter, commonly shared pathogenic variants and recurrent novel variants among the BIL cases were preliminarily examined for their potential functional impact."

Originally, we planned to select 5 CML and 5 AML from the BIL cases successively by date of admission, but only 4 AML cases met the selection criteria, so we finally included one more CML to get 10 study cases in total. Written informed consent for participating the study was obtained from all the cases or their guardians.\nWe collected and sorted demographic, occupational and medical information of the cases from their\nelectronic medical records. Peripheral blood samples of the cases were collected after their routine laboratory examination during the hospitalization, and stored at \u2212 80\u00a0 \u00b0C for later use. Unfortunately, paired normal samples were not obtained at the same time. The use of patient information and peripheral blood samples for further studies beyond routine laboratory examination was approved by the Ethics Committee of SPTCOD (No. LL-202036). This study abides by the Helsinki Declaration on ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects."

The DNA fragments with the size mainly distributed between 150 and 250\u00a0bp were repaired with an \"A\" base added at the 3\u2032-end of each strand, thereafter adapters were ligated to both ends of the end repaired/dA tailed DNA fragments, which were selected by size, amplified by ligationmediated PCR (S1000 Thermal Cycler, Bio-Rad, USA), purified [QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, QIAGEN China (Shanghai)], and hybridized to the exome array for enrichment. After washing out non-hybridized fragments, captured products were circularized and the rolling circle amplification was performed to produce DNA nanoballs. Each resulting qualified captured library was then loaded on BGISEQ-500 sequencing platforms (MGI Tech, China) to perform high-throughput sequencing [15, 16]. Sequencing-derived raw image files were processed by BGISEQ-500 base calling software with default parameters to generate the sequence data of each case as paired-end reads."

All clean data of each sample were then mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh38) using Burrows\u2013 Wheeler Aligner (BWA V0.7.15) [17, 18]. Local realignment around small insertions and deletions (InDels) and base quality score recalibration were performed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) [19, 20], with duplicate reads removed by Picard tools [21]. The strict data analysis quality control system was built through the\nwhole process to guarantee qualified sequencing data. All genomic variations including single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and InDels were detected by the state-of-the-art software, such as HaplotypeCaller of GATK (v3.7). After that, the hard-filtering method was applied to get highconfident variant calls, and the SnpEff tool was applied to perform a series of annotations for variants [22, 23]. Detailed description of the bioinformatics analysis has been reported before [15, 16].\nAdvanced data analysis and plotting were performed using R v4.0.4 [24]. We first used MAF < 1% as a cutoff value to filter out potential polymorphic or benign variants, and the obtained variants were examined for their located genes, which were then put into KOBAS v3.0 for pathway enrichment using the KEGG database with P value and corrected P value both < 0.05 [25]. Commonly shared variants among the BIL cases were identified and assessed for their functional impact. Subsequently, we further excluded those recorded in dbSNP and in gnomAD to get novel variants, and the variants-located genes were subjected to a similar pathway analysis. Thereafter, the recurrent novel variants were examined for their potential impact on normal functions of the genes."

            "text": "Despite presenting different clinical types, BIL has been proved to be caused by and is diagnosed primarily on benzene exposure. Recurrent genetic variants may exist among different BIL patients. In order to find variants that may help understand carcinogenic mechanisms of BIL and finally make more effective prevention and treatment measures, we carried out the WES on peripheral blood samples of 10 BIL cases, and identified 48,802 variants in exons in total, 97.3% of which were SNVs. After filtering out variants with MAF \u2265 1%, we obtained 8667 potentially pathogenic variants, of which 174 were shared by all the BIL cases. We also identified 1010 novel variants that might be specifically related to BIL, and one of them was shared by 90% cases.\nBecause paired normal samples of the cases were not available, we could not accurately differentiate somatic\nvariants from those of germline. By using MAF < 1% as the cutoff value, which is recommended by the Interpretation of Sequence Variants in Somatic Conditions Working Group and also commonly used across many clinical laboratories [26], we obtained variants that were very likely to be somatic and disease-related. However, the number of the variants was much larger than averagely 13 per sample in de novo AML or 8 per sample in newly diagnosed CML as previously reported by the Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network and Togasaki et\u00a0al. [27, 28] Apart from naturally acquired and accumulated through the long-term course of BIL, some variants might be introduced by the therapies. Unfortunately, we could not exclude such variants in this study due to the fact that BIL is usually diagnosed as occupational cancer long after it is clinically diagnosed and treated in China.\nThe identified variants located in a wide series of genes, some of which have been reported before, such as TP53, TET2, SF3B1 and PTPN11 in AML [27, 29], and ASXL1, TET2, TET3, CENPF, TLE1, PRDM9, TTN, COL7A1 and DLK1 in CML [13, 14, 28]. Those mutated genes have been suggested to play important roles in carcinogenesis. The following pathway analysis showed that some of the mutated genes were significantly enriched into certain popular cancer-related pathways, such as PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and Ras signaling pathway. The PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway was constantly found activated in a variety of cancers. The PI3K-AKT-mTOR axis consists of many regulators\nof oncogenic potentials, including the catalytic (p110\u03b1) and regulatory (p85\u03b1), of AKT, class IA PI3K, mTOR, RHEB, and eIF4E [30]; it may prompt oncogenic transformation by the mechanisms including stimulation of proliferation, metabolic reprogramming, invasion/ metastasis, survival, and suppression of autophagy and senescence [30]. The Ras signaling pathway is one of the main pathways to transduce intracellular signals in response to mitogens to control cell growth, survival and anti-apoptotic programs. Three RAS genes encode four main protein products: KRAS4A, KRAS4B, NRAS and HRAS [31]. RAS proteins cycle between the GDPbound inactive state (RAS-GDP) and the GTP-bound active state (RAS-GTP) [31]. The active RAS-GTP interacts with downstream effector enzymes including RAF, PI3K, and Ral guanine exchange factors (RalGEFs), transducing the signal to regulate biological behavior [32\u201335]. Ras pathway mutations occur in approximately 19% of all cancers, playing a prominent role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression [36].\nWe further examined recurrence of the variants and found that some variants were identified in each of the BIL cases, which gives P values no more than 8.8 \u00d7 10\u221214. The result suggested that the shared variants were significantly related to BIL. As previously inferred, some of the shared variants might be involved in the process of carcinogenesis, some might occur through the development of the disease, and others might be induced by the therapies.\nBy excluding variants recorded in the public databases, we obtained novel variants in BIL. Some of the novel variants might be specifically related to BIL, while others might be previously undiscovered, non-specific variants. Some of the novel variants were also located in genes that can be enriched into cancer-related pathways such as PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, suggesting that they might participate in the carcinogenic mechanisms of BIL.\nWhen examining the recurrence of the novel variants, we found one variant shared by 90% cases. It locates in SESN3 gene. The SESN3 gene encoded protein (Sestrin 3) belongs to a small protein family that has been implicated in multiple biological processes including antioxidative stress, anti-aging, cell signaling, and metabolic homeostasis [37]. Sestrin 3 was suggested to play a critical tumor suppressor role through multiple mechanisms, including inhibition of the hedgehog signaling, controlling regeneration of peroxiredoxins to balance reactive oxygen species (ROS) upregulation induced by oncogenic Ras [37\u201339]. In BCR-ABL expressing cells, SESN3 mediated anti-leukemic responses through inhibition\nof mTOR signaling cascade [40]. Mutations in this gene might eventually result in oncogenesis."
