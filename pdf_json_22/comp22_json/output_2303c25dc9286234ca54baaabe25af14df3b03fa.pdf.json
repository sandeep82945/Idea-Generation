    "abstractText": "Recently a model for the interplay between homophily-based appraisal dynamics and influence-based opinion dynamics has been proposed. The model explores for the first time how the opinions of a group of agents on a certain number of issues/topics is influenced by the agents\u2019 mutual appraisal and, conversely, the agents\u2019 mutual appraisal is updated based on the agents\u2019 opinions on the various issues, according to a homophily model. In this paper we show that a simplified (and, in some situations, more feasible) version of the model, that accounts only for the signs of the agents\u2019 appraisals rather than for their numerical values, provides an equally accurate and effective model of the opinion dynamics in small networks. The equilibria reached by this model correspond, almost surely, to situations in which the agents\u2019 network is complete and structurally balanced. On the other hand, we ensure that such equlibria can always be reached in a finite number of steps, and, differently from the original model, we rule out other types of equilibria that correspond to disconnected social networks.",

            "heading": "1. Introduction",
            "text": "Over the last few decades, the modelling and analysis of sociological phenomena have attracted the interests of researchers from various fields, such as\nPreprint submitted to European Journal of Control April 15, 2022\nsociology, economics, and mathematics [3, 9, 10, 15]. In several cases, sociological models represent the primary focus of the investigation, but there are numerous contexts, such as product promotion, spread of diseases, resource allocation, etc., where social dynamics represents the context in which other phenomena evolve. Consequently, understanding its behaviour represents a preliminary but fundamental step in order to investigate and understand the evolution of the process of interest [1, 17]. As a result, it becomes of great importance to build a reliable model for the social dynamics, that allows to forecast the network evolution and thus to design strategies aimed at driving the network towards the desired configuration [22]. Dynamic social balance theory is concerned with the study and analysis of the evolution of socially unbalanced networks towards socially balanced ones, namely networks in balanced configurations in which all the agents split in (at most) two groups in such a way that all the agents in the same group have friendly relationships, while agents from different groups have not [12, 14].\nEven if, from a modeling perspective, the study of social balance has rather remote origins, as witnessed by the pioneering works of Heider [14], Cartwright and Harary [11, 12], DeGroot [8], the dynamic social balance theory represents an active and timely research topic. In this regard we mention the recent works of Mei et al. [19] in which two dynamical models based on two different social mechanisms, the homophily mechanism and the influence mechanism, are proposed. In the homophily mechanism, individuals update their mutual appraisals based on their appraisals of the other group members. In the influence mechanism, instead, each agent attributes an influence to the other network members, based on the appraisal that the agent has about them. Reference [19] shows that both mechanisms drive the network towards social balance, but the homophily mechanism gives a more general explanation for the emergence of the social balance with respect to the influence one. A relevant contribution to the dynamic social balance analysis is the one from Quattrocchi et al. [23] whose model takes into account the presence of media and gossip as separate mechanisms. Another inspiring work in which a sociological mathematical model, including two coexisting social mechanisms, is studied, is the recent work from Liu et al. [16].\nIn [16] a novel model in which the interpersonal appraisals and the individual opinions evolve according to an intertwined dynamics has been proposed for the first time. In the proposed state space model, the authors assume as state variables both the interpersonal appraisals and the agent\u2019s opinions,\nnamely the opinions of the agents on a specific selection of topics. Specifically, the model relies on the assumption that the opinion that an agent has on a particular issue is the (signed) weighted average of the opinions that all the other agents have on that issue, where the weights are the appraisals that the agent has about each of them. At the same time, the interpersonal relationship of an agent pair depends on the comparison between the opinions that the two agents have about all the topics into play, thus following a homophily mechanism. This model can be interpreted as a mathematical formalization of a form of cognitive bias known in psychology as \u201cbandwagon bias\u201d [21], by this meaning that our opinions on topics and issues are influenced by the opinions that other individuals have on the same topics and by the relationships we have with those individuals. Bandwagon bias results in an intertwined dynamics involving both a homophily mechanisms for the interpersonal relationships and an influence mechanism for the agents\u2019 opinions. This is in line with the fact that, in real life, interpersonal appraisals influence individual opinions and viceversa. Another dynamical model that studies how cognitive bias drives the formation of social influences can be found in [4].\nInspired by [16] we propose here a mixed-binary and real-valued version of the aforementioned model, by this meaning that while we assume that the agent\u2019s opinions take (positive or negative) real values, that represent their levels of appreciation or dislike of each specific issue, we do not quantify the level of mutual appraisal, but only take into account whether the mutual relationships between pairs of agents are friendly or hostile. This simplified assumption has been adopted in our previous work [7], as well as in the works of Cisneros-Velarde et al. [5] and of Mei et al. [18] in which mutual appraisals are treated as binary variables. In particular, in [18] the evolution of a signed unweighted non-all-to-all network towards the straightforward generalization of the concept of structural balance has been proposed, thus leading to the graph-theoretical concept of \u201ctriad-wise structural balance\u201d, where each agent\u2019s ego-networks satisfies the structural balance property. This discrete-time \u201cgossip-like\u201d model enjoys the property of convergence towards a non-all-to-all structural balance configuration, while the structure of the associated graph is time invariant, since only the signs of the weights change. In [5] a network formation game, in which pairs of rational individuals strategically change the signs of the edges in a complete network is proposed. The game is shown to strategically reduce the cognitive dissonance in the network along time, by driving the network towards clustering\nbalance [6]. The motivation behind the study of the dynamical evolution of unweighted signed social networks, that units the aforementioned works, comes from the fact that there are many circumstances in which recognizing the type (friendly or hostile) of relationship between individuals is easy, while assessing its intensity is complicated and prone to model errors. In fact, while individual evaluations of certain products or their opinions on certain topics can be easily obtained, attributing numerical values to the mutual appraisals is more challenging and oftentimes individuals prefer to not even reveal them.\nWe show that our simpler model retains all the good properties of the model proposed in [16] both in terms of transient behaviour and convergence to structurally balanced equilibria, meanwhile strengthening some of the results derived for that model. In particular, our model exhibit only two types of long term behavior: either the social network converges in finite time towards a socially balanced all-to-all equilibrium or asymptotically converges to zero. Other equilibrium structures, that arise for the model in [16] and that correspond to the case when the group of agents splits into disconnected structurally balanced subnetworks, are ruled out by our model assumptions, which are designed for small networks. In such contexts, getting an all-to-all equilibrium network is realistic and, as it will be clear from simulations, the situation when a structurally balanced equilibrium cannot be found and all individuals eventually weaken their opinions and appraisal to avoid long term conflicts (see [3]) is a very rare occurrence.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 the model is introduced and its equilibrium conditions are studied, Section 3 deals with the finite time behaviour of the model, while in Section 4 its asymptotic convergence properties are studied. Section 6 concludes the paper.\nNotation. Given k, n \u2208 Z, with k < n, the symbol [k, n] denotes the integer set {k, k+1, . . . , n}. We let ei denote the i-th vector of the canonical basis of Rn, where the dimension n will be clear from the context. The vectors 1n and 0n denote the n-dimensional vectors whose entries are all 1 or 0, respectively.\nThe function sgn: Rn\u00d7m \u2192 {\u22121, 0, 1}n\u00d7m is the function that maps a real matrix into a matrix taking values in {\u22121, 0, 1}, in accordance with the sign of its entries.\nIn the sequel, the (i, j)-th entry of a matrix X is denoted either by Xij or by [X]ij , while the i-th entry of a vector v either by vi or by [v]i. The\nnotation X = diag{x1, x2, . . . , xN} indicates the diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are x1, x2, . . . , xN . Given a matrix X \u2208 RN\u00d7N , the spectrum of X, \u03c3(X), is the set of eigenvalues of X. An undirected and signed graph is a triple [20] G = (V, E ,A), where V = {1, . . . , N} = [1, N ] is the set of vertices, E \u2286 V \u00d7 V the set of arcs (edges), and A \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1}N\u00d7N the adjacency matrix of the graph G. An arc (j, i) belongs to E if and only if Aij 6= 0 and when so it may have either weight 1 or weight \u22121. As the graph is undirected, (i, j) belongs to E if and only if (j, i) \u2208 E , and they have the same weight (equivalently A is a symmetric matrix). A sequence j1 \u2194 j2 \u2194 j3 \u2194 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2194 jk \u2194 jk+1 is a path of length k connecting j1 and jk+1 provided that (j1, j2), (j2, j3), . . . , (jk, jk+1) \u2208 E . A closed path in which each node, except the start-end node, is distinct is called cycle, and a cycle of unitary length is also known as self-loop. Since the adjacency matrix uniquely identifies the graph, in the following we will oftentimes use the notation G(A) to denote the graph having A \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1}N\u00d7N as adjacency matrix. The graph G is said to be complete if, for every pair of vertices (i, j), i, j \u2208 V, there is an edge connecting them, namely (i, j) \u2208 E . If so, E = V \u00d7 V and A \u2208 {\u22121, 1}N\u00d7N . Given three distinct vertices i, j and k \u2208 V, the triad (i, j, k) is said to be balanced [5] if AijAjkAki = 1 and unbalanced if AijAjkAki = \u22121.\nIn this work we consider undirected and signed graphs with unitary self loops. Therefore the adjacency matrix of the graph belongs to the set [7]\nSN1 := {M \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1} N\u00d7N : M = M\u22a4, Mii = 1, \u2200i \u2208 [1, N ]}. (1)\nA graph G is said to be structurally balanced if it can be partitioned into two factions of vertices such that edges between vertices of the same faction have nonnegative weights, and edges between vertices from different factions have nonpositive weights (see, also, the aforementioned concept of \u201ctriadwise structural balance\u201d in [18]). The following result easily follows from Lemma 2.2 in [19].\nLemma 1 (Structural balance for complete graphs). Given a matrix X \u2208 SN1 \u2229 {\u22121, 1} N\u00d7N , the following facts are equivalent:\ni) X = pp\u22a4, for some vector p \u2208 {\u22121, 1}N ;\nii) rank(X) = 1;\nii) for every a, b \u2208 [1, N ] either e\u22a4a X = e \u22a4 b X or e \u22a4 a X = \u2212e \u22a4 b X ;\niv) the graph G(X) is structurally balanced;\nv) all the triads (i, j, k) of distinct vertices in G(X) are balanced.\nIn the following we will say that X is structurally balanced if G(X) is structurally balanced."

This information is collected in a matrix Y(t) \u2208 RN\u00d7m, whose (i, j)-th entry is the opinion that agent i has about the issue j at the time instant t. Y(t) is called the opinion matrix at the time instant t of the social network. We assume that the opinion matrix and the appraisal matrix evolve according to an intertwined dynamics expressed by the following equations\nX(t+ 1) = sgn(Y(t)Y(t)\u22a4) (2)\nY(t+ 1) = 1\nN X(t+ 1)Y(t) (3)\n1Since we consider small-medium size networks, this formalizes the case when agent i knows agent j but does not find correlation between its own choices and agent j\u2019s opinions, and hence chooses not to give it any weight.\nthat component-wise correspond to\nXij(t + 1) = sgn\n(\nm \u2211\nk=1\nYik(t)Yjk(t)\n)\n(4)\nYij(t + 1) = 1\nN\nN \u2211\nk=1\nXik(t+ 1)Ykj(t). (5)\nEquation (5) shows that the opinion that agent i has about issue j at the time instant t + 1 is a (signed) weighted average of the opinions that all agents have about the topic j at the time instant t, where the weights are the appraisals that agent i has about them at the time instant t, divided by the number of agents.\nOn the other hand, from equation (4), we notice that the the (i, j)-th entry of the appraisal matrix at the time instant t+ 1, namely, the appraisal that agent i has about agent j at the time instant t+1, depends on the comparison between the opinions that agents i and j have about all the topics at the time instant t. In particular, if the agents agree (resp. disagree) on a specific issue k, this will give a positive (resp. negative) contribution Yik(t)Yjk(t) > 0 (resp. Yik(t)Yjk(t) < 0), in determining the relationship between i and j at the time instant t + 1.\nEssentially, this model captures the evolution of opinion-dependent timevarying graph structures. In this regard one can see analogies with the pioneering work form Hagselmann-Krause [13], in which the closeness of opinions determines the structure topology of the (unweighted) interaction graph. On the other hand, in our model all agents potentially communicate and their opinions will rather determine the type (friendly/antagonistic) of relationship. Equations (2) and (3) can be grouped into a single equation that describes the update of the opinion matrix alone and takes the form\nY(t+ 1) = 1\nN sgn(Y(t)Y(t)\u22a4)Y(t). (6)\nEquation (6) shows that the mathematical abstraction of the bandwagon bias leads the intertwining between opinion dynamics and appraisal dynamics to a peculiar form of opinion dynamics model. It is immediate to notice that if Y(0) has a zero row (a situation that formalizes the case when one of the agents expresses no opinion on any of the m topics), then that same row remains zero in every subsequent opinion matrix Y(t), t \u2265 0. Similarly, if\nY(0) has a zero column (none of the agents expresses any judgement on a specific topic), that same column remains zero in all the matrices Y(t), t \u2265 0. Therefore both cases are of no interest (substantially, one can always remove the agent and/or the topic and focus on the analysis of the remaining variables) and will not be considered in the following.\nRemark 2. Compared with the model proposed and investigated in [16], we have modified the law that governs the appraisal matrix update and how it affects the opinion dynamics in two aspects. First, we have chosen to keep into account only the signs of the mutual appraisals, rather than their absolute values. This is motivated by the fact that, in a lot of practical situations, being able to assess the sign of the mutual appraisal is easier and more robust to modeling errors with respect to determining the numerical value associated to the tie strength. Moreover, the influence that agent j can have on the opinion agent i has on a certain issue does not necessarily scale with the absolute value of Xij. Secondly, we have chosen to \u201cgive a weight\u201d also to the fact that a pair of agents chooses not rely on each other\u2019s opinion, namely to the fact that Xij = 0. Since we consider small-medium size networks, this formalizes the case when agent i knows agent j but does not find correlation between its own choices and agent j\u2019s opinions, and hence chooses not to give it any weight. In this perspective, the fact that the mutual appraisal is 0 is an information that should be considered and this motivates the fact that in the opinion dynamics update equation (5) each row is divided by the overall number of agents N , rather than by the absolute value of its entries. It is worth noticing that, however, since the appraisal matrix is obtained by comparing the (real valued) opinions of the agents on the various topics into play, and its (i, j)-th entry is zero only if the opinion vectors of agents i and j are orthogonal, a zero entry in the appraisal matrix is a very rare occurrence, as it will be confirmed by the numerical simulations at the end of the paper. As we will see in the following, our model retains all the relevant features of the model investigated in [16], and it is simpler to analyse and implement.\nAssumption 1(No zero rows/columns). In the following, we will steadily assume that Y(0) is devoid of zero rows/columns.\nLemma 3 (No zero rows dynamics). If Y(0) \u2208 RN\u00d7m has no zero rows, then for every t \u2265 0 the matrix Y(t), obtained from the model (6) corresponding to the initial condition Y(0), has no zero rows.\nProof. Suppose, by contradiction, that this is not the case, and let t0 \u2265 0 be the smallest time instant such that Y(t0) has no zero rows, but Y(t0+1) has (at least) one zero row. It entails no loss of generality assuming that the first row of Y(t0 + 1) becomes zero (if not we can always resort to a relabelling of the agents to reduce ourselves to this case). If we set Y := Y(t0), this means that Y has no zero rows, but\ne\u22a41 sgn(YY \u22a4)Y = 0\u22a4.\nSet z\u22a4 := e\u22a41 sgn(YY \u22a4) \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1}1\u00d7N . We observe that since the first row of Y is not zero then the (1, 1)-entry of YY\u22a4 is positive and hence the first entry of z is 1. The remaining ones belong to {\u22121, 0, 1}. We distinguish two cases: either all the other entries of z are zero (Case A) or there exist other nonzero entries in z (Case B), and in this latter case we can assume without loss of generality (if not, we can always permute the m topics, namely the m columns of Y, to make this possible) that\nz\u22a4 = [ 1 z2 . . . zr 0 . . . 0 ] , zi \u2208 {\u22121, 1}, i \u2208 [2, r].\nCondition z\u22a4Y = 0\u22a4 implies that the columns of Y are all orthogonal to the vector z. In Case B this implies that Y can be expressed as\nY =\n\n 1\u22a4r\u22121 \u03a3\n0\u22a4 0\u22a4\n0 IN\u2212r\n\n\n[\nCa Cb\n]\n(7)\nfor some matrices Ca \u2208 R(r\u22121)\u00d7m andCb \u2208 R(N\u2212r)\u00d7m, where \u03a3 := \u2212diag{z2, . . . , zr}. On the other hand, the vector z\u22a4 and the matrix Y are related by the identity z\u22a4 = e\u22a41 sgn(YY \u22a4) = sgn(e\u22a41 YY \u22a4), and hence it must be\n[ 1 z2 . . . zr 0 . . . 0 ] = sgn\n(\n1\u22a4r\u22121Ca [ C\u22a4a C \u22a4 b ]\n[\n1r\u22121 \u03a3 0 0 0 IN\u2212r\n])\n.\nThis implies, in particular, that\n[ z2 . . . zr ] = sgn(1\u22a4r\u22121CaC \u22a4 a \u03a3),\nor, entrywise, keeping into account the definition of \u03a3:\nzi = \u2212sgn(1 \u22a4 r\u22121CaC \u22a4 a ziei\u22121), \u2200 i \u2208 [2, r].\nThis amounts to saying that\nsgn(1\u22a4r\u22121CaC \u22a4 a ei\u22121) = \u22121, \u2200 i \u2208 [2, r],\nnamely 1\u22a4r\u22121CaC \u22a4 a \u226a 0, by this meaning that it is a vector with all negative entries. But this would imply \u2016C\u22a4a 1r\u22121\u2016 2 = 1\u22a4r\u22121CaC \u22a4 a 1r\u22121 < 0, which is clearly impossible. We consider now Case A. If the only nonzero entry of z is the first one, then Y can be expressed as Y = WC0, where W = [0|IN\u22121]\u22a4 and C0 is a real matrix of size (N \u2212 1)\u00d7m. By resorting to the same reasoning as in Case B, condition z\u22a4 = e\u22a41 sgn(YY\n\u22a4) becomes [\n1 0 . . . 0 ] = sgn(e1WC0C \u22a4 0 W\u22a4) = sgn(0\u22a4),\nwhich is impossible. Therefore it is not possible that there exists t0 \u2265 0 such that Y(t0) has no zero rows, but Y(t0 + 1) has (at least) one zero row.\nBased on the preliminary remarks and Lemma 3, we introduce the set [19]\nSnz\u2212rows := {Y \u2208 R N\u00d7m : e\u22a4i Y 6= 0 \u22a4, \u2200 i \u2208 [1, N ]},\nand in the following we will steadily assume that Y(0) \u2208 Snz\u2212rows, and hence Y(t) \u2208 Snz\u2212rows for every t \u2265 0. It is worth noticing that, differently from [16], we do not need to impose that Y(0) \u2208 Y := {Y : Y(t) \u2208 Snz\u2212rows\u2200t \u2265 0}, since for our model it suffices to assume that Y(0) \u2208 Snz\u2212rows to guarantee that Y(t) \u2208 Snz\u2212rows, \u2200t \u2265 0. Note that, as a further consequence, for every t \u2265 0,X(t+1) = sgn(Y(t)Y(t)\u22a4) is a symmetric matrix with unitary diagonal entries, and hence belongs to SN1 , \u2200t \u2265 0.\nRemark 4. The case when there exists t > 0 such that the matrix Y(t) has a zero column, even if Y(0) has no zero columns, may arise, but it is a rare occurrence. This happens if and only if one of the columns of Y(t) belongs to the kernel of the matrix X(t + 1) = sgn(Y(t)Y(t)\u22a4). This means that at the time t the column vector describing the opinions that the agents have on some specific topic is such that for every agent i the sum of the opinions of the agents trusted by i equals the sum of the opinions of the agents not trusted by agent i. Since the agents\u2019opinions are arbitrary real numbers this case arises for a set of initial conditions Y(0) having zero measure.\nAn elementary example is represented by the case when Y(0) =\n[\n1 \u01eb 2 \u2212\u01eb\n]\n,\nwhere \u01eb is nonzero and sufficiently small. Correspondingly, we get Y(1) = [\n3/2 0 3/2 0\n]\n.\nAfter having explored these preliminary aspects regarding agents that become indifferent to all issues, or issues that become irrelevant to all agents, we want to investigate the existence and structure of the equilibrium points for the model (2)- (3), when starting from initial opinion matrices Y(0) satisfying Assumption 1.\nDefinition 5 (Equilibrium point). A pair (Y\u2217,X\u2217) is an equilibrium point for the model (2)- (3) if\nX\u2217 = sgn(Y\u2217(Y\u2217)\u22a4) (8) Y\u2217 = 1\nN X\u2217Y\u2217. (9)\nIt is interesting to notice that the only possible nontrivial equilibrium points for the model are those that correspond to a structurally balanced configuration of the appraisal network G(X\u2217). Moreover, the appraisal network is necessarily complete, namely each agent needs to express its appraisal towards all the other agents.\nProposition 6 (Equilibrium equivalence conditions). A pair (Y\u2217,X\u2217) 6= (0, 0) is an equilibrium point for the model (2)- (3) if and only if\ni) X\u2217 = pp\u22a4, for some p \u2208 {\u22121, 1}N ;\nii) Y\u2217 = p [ a1 a2 . . . am ] , for some ai \u2208 R, \u2211m i=1 a 2 i 6= 0.\nProof. It is immediate to observe that if i) and ii) hold, then the identities (8) and (9) hold. Conversely, assume that the pair (Y\u2217,X\u2217) is an equilibrium point. Then (9) holds, but this means that the nonzero columns of Y\u2217 are eigenvectors of 1 N X\u2217 corresponding to the unitary eigenvalue. This means that 1 \u2208 \u03c3 ( 1 N X\u2217 ) and therefore, by Lemma 17 in the Appendix, i) holds. On the other hand, by replacing the matrix X\u2217 in (9) with pp\u22a4, we obtain ii).\nRemark 7. The non-trivial equilibrium points of the model are modulus consensus configurations, see, e.g., [16]. This is also what happens for equilibrium points in [3] and [16]. Moreover, when the model converges to the non-trivial equlibrium configurations, the sign distribution of the opinions mirrors the network partition into factions. As in Altafini\u2019s model [3], and as it will be clear in the following, the system dynamics either achieves modulus consensus (in a finite number of steps) or converges to zero (asymptotically).\nRemark 8. This situation is different from the one that arises with the model investigated in [5], [16] and [18]. In [16] (see Remark 4 and section IV in [16]) the equilibrium points identified in the previous Proposition 6 are not the only possible ones. Indeed, for the model explored in [16] the case may occur that the matrix X\u2217 at the equilibrium corresponds to a non connected graph, whose connected components however achieve structural balance. As we will see later (see Remark 14), if G(X\u2217) becomes disconnected then both the opinion matrix and the appraisal matrix converge to zero. On the other hand, for the binary model in [18], convergence to a non-all-to-all structurally balanced network is also possible while the topological structure of the associated graph is time invariant. Also, under some conditions, convergence to \u201ctwofactions\u201d structural balance is obtained in finite time. The signed formation game in [5] dynamically drives the network towards clustering balance.\nWe want now to show that the model we have proposed cannot exhibit periodic solutions and hence limit cycles. To prove this result we need a preliminary lemma, that will be useful also for the subsequent analysis.\nLemma 9 (Upper bounded opinion dynamics). For every j \u2208 [1, m] and every t \u2265 0 i)\nmax i\u2208[1,N ] |Yij(t+ 1)| \u2264 max i\u2208[1,N ] |Yij(t)|. (10)\nii) Condition max i\u2208[1,N ] |Yij(t+ 1)| = max i\u2208[1,N ] |Yij(t)| 6= 0\nholds if and only if (a) Y(t)ej = p \u00b7 \u00b5j, \u2203 p \u2208 {\u22121, 1}N and \u00b5j > 0; and (b) once we set h := argmaxi\u2208[1,N ]|Yij(t + 1)| then e \u22a4 hX(t + 1) has no zero entries and e\u22a4hX(t+ 1) = ph \u00b7 p \u22a4.\nProof. i) From equation (3) it follows that\n|Yij(t+ 1)| = | 1\nN\nN \u2211\nk=1\nXik(t+ 1)Ykj(t)|\u2264 1\nN\nN \u2211\nk=1\n|Xik(t+ 1)||Ykj(t)|\n\u2264 1\nN\nN \u2211\nk=1\n|Ykj(t)| \u2264 1\nN N max k |Ykj(t)| = max k |Ykj(t)|,\nand hence (10) holds. ii) Set h := argmaxi\u2208[1,N ]|Yij(t+1)|. Then |Yhj(t+1)| = maxi\u2208[1,N ]| Y ij(t+1)| coincides with maxi\u2208[1,N ] |Yij(t)| if and only if\nN \u2211\n\u2113=1\n|Xh\u2113(t+ 1)||Y\u2113j(t)| = N \u00b7 max i\u2208[1,N ] |Yij(t)|\nand this is possible if and only if all the entries in the j-th column of Y(t) have the same absolute value \u00b5j > 0 (and this leads to (a), for some suitable vector p) and all the terms Xh\u2113(t + 1)Y\u2113j(t), \u2113 \u2208 [1, N ], have the same sign. But this latter condition means that e\u22a4hX(t+ 1) either coincides with p\n\u22a4 or with its opposite, and since Xhh(t + 1) = 1 this means that condition (b) holds.\nWe are now in a position to prove the following result.\nProposition 10 (Aperiodicity in opinion dynamics). Suppose that there exist t\u0304 \u2265 0, T \u2265 1 and nonzero matrices Y\u0303i \u2208 RN\u00d7m, i \u2208 [1, T ], such that\nY(t\u0304+ i) = Y\u0303i, i \u2208 [1, T ], and Y(t\u0304+ T + 1) = Y\u03031,\nnamely from t\u0304+ 1 onward the sequence of matrices {Y(t)}t\u2265t\u0304+1 becomes periodic of period T , then T = 1, namely the sequence becomes constant.\nProof. From Lemma 9, part i), we can claim that for every j \u2208 [1, m] and every t \u2265 0\nmax\u2113\u2208[1,N ] |Y\u2113j(t + T + 1)| \u2264 max\u2113\u2208[1,N ] |Y\u2113j(t+ T )|\n\u2264 ... \u2264 max\u2113\u2208[1,N ] |Y\u2113j(t+ 2)| \u2264 max\u2113\u2208[1,N ] |Y\u2113j(t + 1)|.\nBut since for t = t\u0304 we have Y(t\u0304+T +1) = Y(t\u0304+1) = Y\u03031 and hence the two extremes in the previous sequence of inequalities coincide, it follows that all the symbols \u2264 are equalities, namely\nmax \u2113\u2208[1,N ] |[Y\u0303i]\u2113j | = \u00b5j > 0, \u2200 j \u2208 [1, m], \u2200 i \u2208 [1, T ].\nThis also implies, see Lemma 9 part ii), that, for every non zero column in Y\u0303i,\nY\u0303iej = pi \u00b7 \u00b5j, \u2203 pi \u2208 {\u22121, 1} N , \u00b5j > 0, (11)\nand that, for every h \u2208 [1, N ], one has e\u22a4h sgn(Y\u0303iY\u0303 \u22a4 i ) = [pi]h \u00b7 p \u22a4 i . This implies that for every i \u2208 [1, T ]\nsgn([Y\u0303iY\u0303 \u22a4 i ]) = pip \u22a4 i , \u2203 pi \u2208 {\u22121, 1} N\u00d7N .\nConsequently2\nY\u0303(i+1 mod T ) = 1\nN sgn([Y\u0303iY\u0303\n\u22a4 i ])Y\u0303i =\n1\nN pip\n\u22a4 i Y\u0303i. (12)\nSo, by comparing (11) and (12) one gets that every matrix Y\u0303i, i \u2208 [1, T ], takes the form\nY\u0303i = pi\n[\na (i) 1 . . . a (i) m\n]\n, \u2203 pi \u2208 {\u22121, 1} N , a (i) k \u2208 R,\nbut this also implies that\nY\u0303(i+1 mod T ) = 1 N sgn([Y\u0303iY\u0303 \u22a4 i ])Y\u0303i = 1 N sgn(pip \u22a4 i \u00b7 \u2211 k[a (i) k ] 2)pi\n[\na (i) 1 . . . a (i) m\n]\n= 1 N pip \u22a4 i pi\n[\na (i) 1 . . . a (i) m\n]\n= pi\n[\na (i) 1 . . . a (i) m\n]\n= Y\u0303i.\nSo, all matrices Y\u0303i coincide.\n2The expression i+ 1 mod T means the remainder of i+ 1 when divided by T ."

            "text": "We want to explore under what conditions the equilibrium can be reached in a finite number of steps. It is easy to see that if there exists a time instant t0 \u2265 0 such that Y(t0 + 1) = Y(t0) 6= 0 then Y(t) = Y(t0) =: Y\u2217 for every t \u2265 t0. Consequently, also X(t) becomes constant starting at t = t0 + 1, and it coincides with X\u2217 := sgn(Y(t0)Y(t0)\n\u22a4). However, the converse is not true: if the appraisal matrix becomes constant at some time t0 \u2265 0, the opinion matrix Y(t) can still keep evolving for t \u2265 t0. This situation is illustrated in Example 11, below.\nAs a matter of fact, if there exists a time instant t0 \u2265 0 such that X(t) = X\u2217, \u2200t \u2265 t0, we can only claim that Y(t + 1) = 1 N X\u2217Y(t). Equivalently, if we denote by yj(t), the j-th column of the matrix Y(t), then the dynamics expressed by equation (2) decomposes into m linear time invariant systems of the form\nyj(t+ 1) = 1\nN X\u2217yj(t), \u2200 j \u2208 [1, m]. (13)\nAs X\u2217 \u2208 SN1 , the matrix X\n\u2217\nN is symmetric and hence diagonalizable.

The first case is the one depicted in Example 11, namely the case when the systems in (13) are asymptotically stable, which means that Y(t) asymptotically converges to 0 (and hence limt\u2192+\u221e X(t) = 0 6= X\u2217).\nExample 11. Let us consider the case N = m = 3, with\nY(0) =\n\n 1.41 \u22121.21 0.49 1.42 0.72 1.03 0.67 1.63 0.73\n\n .\nIt turns out that \u2200t \u2265 1\nX(t) = X\u2217 =\n\n 1 1 \u22121 1 1 1 \u22121 1 1\n\n\nand \u03c3(1/3 \u00b7X\u2217) = (\u22121/3, 2/3, 2/3), and indeed for t \u2265 14 we have Yij(t) = o(10\u22122), \u2200i, j \u2208 [1, 3].\nThe second possible situation is when X \u2217\nN is simply (but not asymptoti-\ncally) stable. This amounts to saying that 1 is a (simple) eigenvalue of X \u2217\nN ,\nand hence by Lemma 17, X\u2217 takes the form X\u2217 = pp\u22a4, \u2203 p \u2208 {\u22121, 1}N . In this case, the convergence is not asymptotic but instantaneous. In fact, it is sufficient that 1\nN X(t0) becomes simply (but not asymptotically) stable at\na single time instant, to ensure the instantaneous convergence of Y(t) to an equilibrium condition.\nProposition 12 (Equilibrium points characterization). If there exists t0 > 0 such that 1\nN X(t0), with X(t0) \u2208 SN1 , is simply (but not asymptotically) stable,\nthen (X\u2217,Y\u2217) := (X(t0), 1 N X(t0)Y(t0 \u2212 1)) is an equilibrium point.\nProof. By Lemma 17 in the Appendix, we know that if 1 N X(t0) \u2208 S N 1 is simply stable or, equivalently, 1 \u2208 \u03c3( 1 N X(t0)), then there exists a vector p \u2208 {\u22121, 1}N such that X(t0) = pp\u22a4. On the other hand, if X(t0) = pp\u22a4, then\nY(t0) = 1\nN pp\u22a4Y(t0 \u2212 1) = p[a1, . . . , am],\nwhere\n[a1, . . . , am] := 1\nN p\u22a4Y(t0 \u2212 1).\nTherefore (X\u2217,Y\u2217) := (X(t0), 1 N X(t0)Y(t0 \u2212 1)) is an equilibrium point.\nRemark 13. If m = 1 the model reaches the equilibrium in one step. When so, in fact X(1) = sgn(Y(0)Y\u22a4(0)) = pp\u22a4, where p := sgn(Y(0)). Numerical simulations at the end of the paper will show that, when m > 1, namely multiple topics are considered, convergence to structural balance is almost surely guaranteed, and it occurs in a rather small number of steps even for medium size networks (e.g. N = 100).\nRemark 14. Gershgorin Circle theorem also allows to say that if X\u2217 is the adjacency matrix of a disconnected graph, all the eigenvalues of the matrix X \u2217\nN lie in the circle of the complex plane of center the origin and radius N\u22121 N\n(or smaller), and hence X \u2217\nN is necessarily an asymptotically stable matrix.\nTheorem 15 summarizes the main results of this section.\nTheorem 15 (Main theorem). The following conditions are equivalent\ni) there exists a time instant t0 \u2265 0 such that 1 \u2208 \u03c3( 1 N X(t0));\nii) there exists a time instant t0 \u2265 0 such that Y(t0) = Y(t0 + 1);\niii) the opinion-appraisal dynamic model (2)- (3) converges in finite time to an equilibrium (X\u2217,Y\u2217);\niv) the opinion-appraisal dynamic model (2)- (3) converges in finite time to an equilibrium (X\u2217,Y\u2217), with X\u2217 = pp\u22a4 and Y\u2217 = p[a1, . . . , am], \u2203 p \u2208 {\u22121, 1}N , and ai \u2208 R, i \u2208 [1, m], with \u2211m i=1 a 2 i 6= 0.\nProof. iv) \u21d4 iii) follows from Proposition 6. iii) \u21d2 ii) is obvious, while the converse has been commented upon at the beginning of the section. i) \u21d2 iv) follows from Proposition 12, while iv) \u21d2 i) is obvious."

In the former case the overall system (2)- (3) reaches the equilibrium in a finite number of steps. In the latter case a nontrivial equilibrium is reached if and only if X(t) at some point becomes structurally balanced. Differently the opinion matrix asymptotically converges to zero. We want to investigate now if a nontrivial equilibrium can be reached asymptotically, but not in a finite number of steps. An immediate consequence of the analysis of the previous section is that if the sequence of appraisal matrices {X(t)}t\u22651 does not converge in a finite number of steps then X(t) N\nis an asymptotically stable matrix for every t \u2265 1. This means that if we define the set\nSstable := S N 1 \\ {X \u2208 S N 1 : X = pp \u22a4, \u2203p \u2208 {\u22121, 1}N}, (14)\nthen X(t) \u2208 Sstable for every t \u2265 1.\nProposition 16 (Zero vanishing condition). If for every t \u2265 0, X(t) \u2208 Sstable, then limt\u2192+\u221eY(t) = 0.\nProof. For every j \u2208 [1, m], let us define \u00b5j(t) := maxi\u2208[1,N ] |Yij(t)|, and let us introduce the (generalized) Lyapunov function for the system in equation (6), V : RN\u00d7m \u2192 R, defined as\nV (Y(t)) :=\nm \u2211\nj=1\n\u00b5j(t).\nWe notice that V (Y) \u2265 0, \u2200Y \u2208 RN\u00d7m and that V (Y) = 0 if and only if Y = 0. Define \u22062V (Y(t)) := V (Y(t+2))\u2212V (Y(t)). We want to prove that \u22062V (Y(t)) < 0, \u2200t \u2265 0.\nBy Lemma 9 it immediately follows that \u22062V (Y(t)) = \u2211m\nj=1 \u00b5j(t+ 2)\u2212 \u00b5j(t) \u2264 0. We show now that there is not a time instant t0 \u2265 0 such that \u22062V (Y(t)) = 0. If this were the case, in fact, this would mean that \u2200j \u2208 [1, m], \u00b5j(t0+2) = \u00b5j(t0) and therefore \u00b5j(t0+2) = \u00b5j(t0+1) = \u00b5j(t0) =: \u00b5j . As a consequence of Lemma 9 we deduce that\na) Y(t0)ej = pj(t0)\u00b5j, \u2203 pj(t0) \u2208 {\u22121, 1}N ,\nY(t0 + 1)ej = pj(t0 + 1)\u00b5j, \u2203 pj(t0 + 1) \u2208 {\u22121, 1}N ,\nb) \u2200h \u2208 [1, N ], eThX(t0 + 1) = phpj(t0) \u22a4,\nfrom which it follows that X(t0+1) = pj(t0)pj(t0) \u22a4 for every j \u2208 [1, m]. But then X(t0 + 1) = p(t0)p(t0) \u22a4 with p(t0) = \u00b1pj(t0), \u2200j \u2208 [1, m], that means that X(t0+1) is structurally balanced and hence it does not belong to Sstable, thus contradicting the hypotheses. Consequently, it must be \u22062V (Y(t)) < 0, \u2200t \u2265 0. Finally, by defining \u22061V (Y(t)) := V (Y(t + 1)) \u2212 V (Y(t)) we get that\n\u22062V (Y(t)) + \u22061V (Y(t)) < 0, \u2200t \u2265 0,\nso the thesis follows as a direct consequence of Theorem 2.1 in [2].\nSummarizing, Theorem 15 and Proposition 16 show that either there exists a time instant t0 such that \u2200 t \u2265 t0, X(t) = pp\u22a4 and consequently Y(t) = p[a1, a2, . . . , am], ai \u2208 R, \u2211 i a 2 i 6= 0, otherwise, if a time instant t such that X(t) reaches the structural balance does not exist, then Y(t) converges to zero as time goes to infinity."

In order to update the agents\u2019 opinions on a numbers of issues, only the signs (and not the values) of the agents\u2019 mutual\nappraisals are used. This simplified model retains all the main characteristics of the original model, is simpler to analyse and implement, leads to the same kind of nontrivial structurally balanced equilibria as in [16], but rules out nontrivial equilibria that correspond to disconnected socially balanced networks. Furthermore, nontrivial equlibria can always be reached in a finite number of steps, while the case when all opinions and appraisals converge to zero corresponds to sets of initial conditions of zero measure.\nAppendix\nLemma 17 (Rank-one matrices with special structures). Given a matrix M \u2208 SN1 , if 1 \u2208 \u03c3 ( 1 N M )\n, then M = pp\u22a4 for some p \u2208 {\u22121, 1}N , and hence M has no zero entries and \u03c3(M) = (0, . . . , 0, 1).\nProof. Let v := [ v1 v2 . . . vN ]\u22a4 \u2208 RN ,v 6= 0, be an eigenvector of 1 N M corresponding to the unitary eigenvalue, or equivalently of M corresponding to N . Then Mv = Nv.

On the other hand, since condition (a) holds, this means that every index j \u2208 [1, N ] is argmaxi\u2208[1,N ]|vi|, and hence all the rows of M satisfy e \u22a4 i M = pip \u22a4. This implies that M = pp\u22a4, and the rest immediately follows."
