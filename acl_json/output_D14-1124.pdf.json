    "abstractText": "Casual online forums such as Reddit, Slashdot and Digg, are continuing to increase in popularity as a means of communication. Detecting disagreement in this domain is a considerable challenge. Many topics are unique to the conversation on the forum, and the appearance of disagreement may be much more subtle than on political blogs or social media sites such as twitter. In this analysis we present a crowd-sourced annotated corpus for topic level disagreement detection in Slashdot, showing that disagreement detection in this domain is difficult even for humans. We then proceed to show that a new set of features determined from the rhetorical structure of the conversation significantly improves the performance on disagreement detection over a baseline consisting of unigram/bigram features, discourse markers, structural features and meta-post features.",

            "text": "How does disagreement arise in conversation? Being able to detect agreement and disagreement has a range of applications. For an online educator, dissent over a newly introduced topic may alert the teacher to fundamental misconceptions about the material. For a business, understanding disputes over features of a product may be helpful in future design iterations. By better understanding how debate arises and propagates in a conversation, we may also gain insight into how authors\u2019 opinions on a topic can be influenced over time.\nThe long term goal of our research is to lay the foundations for understanding argumentative structure in conversations, which could be applied to NLP tasks such as summarization, information\nretrieval, and text visualization. Argumentative structure theory has been thoroughly studied in both psychology and rhetoric, with negation and discourse markers, as well as hedging and dispreferred responses, being known to be indicative of argument (Horn, 1989; Brown and Levinson, 1987). As a starting point, in this paper we focus on the detection of disagreement in casual conversations between users. This requires a generalized approach that can accurately identify disagreement in topics ranging from something as mundane as whether GPS stands for galactic positioning system or global positioning system, to more ideological debates about distrust in science.\nMotivated by the widespread consensus in both computational and theoretical linguistics on the utility of discourse markers for signalling pragmatic functions such as disagreement and personal opinions (Webber and Prasad, 2008; Abbott et al., 2011; J. E. Fox-Tree, 2010), we introduce a new set of features based on the Discourse Tree (DT) of a conversational text. Discourse Trees were formalized by Mann and Thompson (1988) as part of their Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) to represent the structure of discourse. Although this theory is for monologic discourse, we propose to treat conversational dialogue as a collection of linked monologues, and subsequently build a relation graph describing both rhetorical connections within user posts, as well as between different users. Features obtained from this graph offer significant improvements on disagreement detection over a baseline consisting of meta-post features, lexical features, discourse markers and conversational features. Not only do these features improve disagreement detection, but the discovered importance of relations known to be theoretically relevant to disagreement detection, such as COMPARISON (Horn, 1989), suggest that this approach may be capturing the essential aspects of the conversational argumentative structure.\n1169\nAs a second contribution of this work, we provide a new dataset consisting of 95 topics annotated for disagreement. Unlike the publicly available ARGUE corpus based on the online debate forum 4forums.com (Abbott et al., 2011), our corpus is based on Slashdot, which is a general purpose forum not targeted to debates. Therefore, we expect that detecting disagreement may be a more difficult task in our new corpus, as certain topics (like discussing GPS systems) may be targeted towards objective information sharing without any participants expressing opinions or stances. Because of this, our corpus represents an excellent testbed to examine methods for more subtle disagreement detection, as well as the major differences between news-style and argument-style dialogue."

            "text": "In the past decade, there have been a number of computational approaches developed for the task of disagreement and controversy detection, particularly in synchronous conversations such as meetings (Somasundaran et al., 2007; Raaijmakers et al., 2008) and in monologic corpora such as news collections (Awadallah et al., 2012) and reviews (Popescu et al., 2005; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012).\nIn the domain of synchronous conversations, prosodic features such as duration, speech rate and pause have been used for spoken dialogue (Wang et al., 2011; Galley et al., 2004). Galley et al. (2004) found that local features, such as lexical and structural features, as well as global contextual features, were particularly useful for identifying agreement/disagreement in the ICSI meeting corpus. Germesin and Wilson (2009) also showed accuracies of 98% in detecting agreement in the AMI corpus using lexical, subjectivity and dialogue act features. However, they note that their system could not classify disagreement accurately due to the small number of training examples in this category. Somasundaran et al. additionally show that dialogue act features complement lexical features in the AMI meeting corpus (Somasundaran et al., 2007). These observations are taken into account with our feature choices, and we use contextual, discourse and lexical features in our analysis.\nIn the monologic domain, Conrad et al. (2012) recently found rhetorical relations to be useful for argument labelling and detection in articles on the\ntopic of healthcare. Additionally, discourse markers and sentiment features have been found to assist with disagreement detection in collections of news documents on a particular topic, as well as reviews (Choi et al., 2010; Awadallah et al., 2012; Popescu et al., 2005).\nIn the asynchronous domain, there has been recent work in disagreement detection, especially as it pertains to stance identification. Content based features, including sentiment, duration, and discourse markers have been used for this task (Yin et al., 2012; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010). The structure of a conversation has also been used, although these approaches have focused on simple rules for disagreement identification (Murakami and Raymond, 2010), or have assumed that adjacent posts always disagree (Agrawal et al., 2003). More recent work has focused on identifying users\u2019 attitudes towards each other (Hassan et al., 2010), influential users and posts (Nguyen et al., 2014), as well as identifying subgroups of users who share viewpoints (Abu-Jbara et al., 2010). In Slashdot, the h-index of a discussion has been used to rank articles according to controversiality, although no quantitative evaluation of this approach has been given, and, unlike in our analysis, they did not consider any other features (Gomez et al., 2008). Content based features such as polarity and cosine similarity have also been used to study influence, controversy and opinion changes on microblogging sites such as Twitter (Lin et al., 2013; Popescu and Pennacchiotti, 2010).\nThe simplified task of detecting disagreement between just two users (either a question/response pair (Abbott et al., 2011) or two adjacent paragraphs (Misra and Walker, 2013)) has also been recently approached on the ARGUE corpus. Abbott et al. (2011) use discourse markers, generalized dependency features, punctuation and structural features, while Misra and Walker (2013) focus on n-grams indicative of denial, hedging and agreement, as well as cue words and punctuation. Most similar to our work is that by Mishne and Glance (2006). They performed a general analysis of weblog comments, using punctuation, quotes, lexicon counts, subjectivity, polarity and referrals to detect disputative and non-disputative comments. Referrals and questions, as well as polarity measures in the first section of the post, were found to be most useful. However, their analysis did not\ntake into account many features that have been subsequently shown to be relevant, such as discourse markers and conversational structure, and was hampered by a severe imbalance in the test set (with very few disputative comments).\nOur method takes advantage of insights from many of these previous studies, focusing on discussion thread structure as well as text based features to form our basic feature set. It is unlike Mishne and Glance\u2019s work in that we incorporate several new features, have a balanced testing and training set, and only use comments from one type of online blog. Furthermore, it is a very different task from those so far performed on the ARGUE corpus, as we consider topics discussed by more than two users. We aim to compare our features to those found to be previously useful in these related tasks, and expect similar feature sets to be useful for the task of disagreement detection in this new corpus."

            "text": "The corpus stems from the online forum Slashdot.1 Slashdot is a casual internet forum, including sections for users to ask questions, post articles, and review books and games. For the task of disagreement detection, we focus our analysis on the section of the site where users can post articles, and then comment either on the article or respond to other users\u2019 posts. This results in a treelike dialogue structure for which the posted article is the root, and branches correspond to threads of comments. Each comment has a timestamp at the minute resolution as well as author information (although it is possible to post on the forum anonymously). Additionally, other users can give different posts scores (in the range -1 to 5) as well as categorizing posts under \u201cfunny\u201d, \u201cinteresting\u201d, \u201cinformative\u201d, \u201cinsightful\u201d, \u201cflamebait\u201d, \u201coff topic\u201d, or \u201ctroll\u201d. This user moderation, as well as the\n1www.slashdot.org\nformalized reply-to structure between comments, makes Slashdot attractive over other internet forums as it allows for high-quality and structured conversations.\nIn a previous study, Joty et al. (2013) selected 20 articles and their associated comments to be annotated for topic segmentation boundaries and labels by an expert Slashdot contributor. They define a topic as a subset of the utterances in a conversation, while a topic label describes what the given topic is about (e.g., Physics in videogames). Of the 98 annotated topics from their dataset, we filtered out those with only one contributing user, for a total of 95 topics. Next, we developed a Human Intelligence Task (HIT) using the crowdsourcing platform Crowdflower.2 The objective of this task was to both develop a corpus for testing our disagreement detection system, as well as to investigate how easily human annotators can detect disagreement in casual online forums. For training, users were shown 3 sample topics, labelling them as containing disagreement or not. In each round, annotators were shown 5 topics, with a set of radio buttons for participants to choose \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d, or \u201cNot sure\u201d in response to asking whether or not the users in the conversation disagree on the topic. In order to limit the number of spam responses, users were shown test questions, which consisted of topics where there was obvious disagreement, as well as topics where there was obviously no disagreement (either agreement, or more news-style information sharing). We required that users correctly identify 4 of these test topics before they were allowed to continue with the task. Users were also shown test questions throughout the task, which, if answered incorrectly, would reduce the amount of money they received for the task, and ultimately disqualify them.\nFor each topic, five different judgements were obtained. We consider the trust of each partici-\n2www.Crowdflower.com\npant as the fraction of test questions which they answered correctly. Then, each topic is assigned a score according to a weighted average of the responses, with the weight being the trust of each participant:\nscore = A \u2211\nusers\n( testcorrect testtotal )useri \u00d7 (0, 0.5, 1) (1)\nwhere 0, 0.5 and 1 represent the answers \u201cNo\u201d, \u201cNot sure\u201d and \u201cYes\u201d to the question of disagreement existence, and A is a normalization factor. If the score is less than 0.5, its confidence would be 1\u2212score towards \u201cNo disagreement\u201d, whereas greater than 0.5 would be a confidence of score towards \u201cDisagreement\u201d. The average confidence score across all topics was 0.73. Our corpus consists of 49 topics without disagreement and 46 topics with disagreement. Interestingly, 22 topics had confidence scores below 55%, which suggests that subtle disagreement detection is a subjective and difficult task. Further statistics for the developed corpus are given in Table 1."

            "text": "Discourse markers have been found to aid in argument and disagreement detection, and for tasks such as stance identification (Abbott et al., 2011; Misra and Walker, 2013; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009). We aim to improve over discourse markers by capturing the underlying dis-\ncourse structure of the conversation in terms of discourse relations.\nIn Rhetorical Structure Theory, Discourse trees are a hierarchical representation of document structure for monologues (Mann and Thompson, 1988). At the lowest level, Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) are connected by discourse relations (such as ELABORATION and COMPARISON), which in turn form larger discourse units that are also linked by these relations. Computational systems (discourse parsers) have been recently developed to automatically generate a discourse tree for a given monologue (Joty et al., 2013). Although theoretically the rhetorical relations expected in dialogues are different from those in monologues (Stent and Allen, 2000), no sophisticated computational tools exist yet for detecting these relations reliably. The core idea of this work is that some useful (although noisy) information about the discourse structure of a conversation can be obtained by applying state-of-the-art document level discourse parsing to parts of the conversation.\nMore specifically, posts on a particular topic are concatenated according to their temporal order. This pseudo-monologic document is then fed to a publicly available document level discourse parser (Joty et al., 2013). A discourse tree such as that seen in Figure 1a is output by the parser. Then, we extract the novel relation graph (Figure 1b) from the discourse tree. In this graph, each node (N1, N2, N3) corresponds to a post (P1, P2, P3) and links aim to capture the argumentative structure. There are three cases when a link is added between two nodes in the relation graph. Firstly, links existing between two posts directly, such as the COMPARISON relation between P2 and P3, are added between the corresponding nodes in the re-\nlation graph (N2 and N3). Secondly, links existing between fractions of posts in the discourse tree are added to the relation graph (e.g. if (S2,P2) was connected to (S1,P3) directly, N2 and N3 would have an additional link with that label). Finally, when posts are connected through internal nodes (such as P1 and I1 in Figure 1a), a labelled link is added for each post in the internal node to the relation graph (N1->N2 and N1->N3 in Figure 1b).\nThis relation graph allows for the extraction of many features that may reflect argumentative structure, such as the number of connections, the frequency of each rhetorical relation in the graph per post (diff per post), and the frequency as a percentage of all rhetorical relations (diff percentage). For example, COMPARISON relations are known to indicate disagreement (Horn, 1989), so we expect higher frequencies of this relation if the conversation contains argument. Features from the discourse tree such as the average depth of each rhetorical relation are also added to reflect the cohesiveness of conversation. Moreover, features combining the graph and tree representations, such as the ratio of the frequency of a rhetorical relation occurring between different posts to the average depth (CONTRAST between different postsAverage depth of CONTRAST ), called avg ratio are implemented. These reflect the hypothesis that relations connecting larger chunks of text (or whole posts) may be more important than those connecting sentences or only partial posts.\nFinally, the sub-trees corresponding to individual posts are used to extract the average frequency of rhetorical relations within a post (same per post) and the average frequency of a rhetorical relation with respect to other rhetorical relations in the post (same percentage). A measure of how often a rhetorical relation connects different users compared to how often it connects discourse units in the same post (same to diff ), is also added. These capture the intuition that certain rhetorical relations such as CAUSE, EVIDENCE and EXPLANATION are expected to appear more within a post if users are trying to support their perspective in an argument. In total, there are 18 (rhetorical relations)\u00d77 (avg ratio, avg depth, same per post, same percentage, diff percentage, diff per post, same to diff ) + 1 (number of connections) = 127 features."

Therefore, we also include an aggregated count of all 17 discourse markers in each fifth of the posts in a topic (e.g. the count of all 17 discourse markers in the first fifth of every post in the topic). Altogether, there are 5 aggregated discourse marker features in addition to the 17 frequency count features."

For this work, we use four sentiment scoring categories: the variance, average score, number of negative sentences, and controversiality score (Carenini and Cheung, 2008) of sentences in a post. These are determined using SoCAL (Taboada et al., 2011), which gives each sentence a polarity score and has been shown to work well on user-generated content.\nOverall, we have two main classes of sentiment features. The first type splits all the posts in a topic into 4 sections corresponding to the sentences in each quarter of the post. The sentiment scores described above are then applied to each section of the posts (e.g. one feature is the number of negative sentences in the first quarter of each post). As a separate feature, we also include the scores on just the first sentence, as Mishne and Glance (2006) previously found this to be beneficial. This gives a total of 4\u00d75 = 20 features. We refer to this set as \u201csentiment\u201d.\nMotivated by the rhetorical features, our second main class of sentiment features aims to identify \u201cmore important\u201d posts for argument detection by applying the four categories of sentiment scores to only those posts connected by each of our 18 rhetorical relations. This is done for both posts with an inner rhetorical connection (identified by the sub-tree for that post), as well as for posts connected by a rhetorical relation in the relation graph. This results in a total of (4 sentiment categories)\u00d7(2 (different + same post connections))\u00d7(18 rhetorical relations) = 144 features. This set is referred to as \u201cRhetSent\u201d."

In online, threaded conversations, the standard approach to extracting conversational structure is through reply-to relations usually present in online forums. However, if users strongly disagree on a topic (or sub-topic), they may choose to quote a specific paragraph (defined as a fragment) of a previous post in their reply. Being able to determine which specific fragments are linked by relations may then be useful for more targeted content-based features, helping to reduce noise. In order to address this, we use the Fragment Quotation Graph (FQG), an approach previously developed by Carenini et al. (2007) for dialogue act modelling and topic segmentation (Joty et al., 2011; Joty et al., 2013).\nFor our analysis, the FQG is found over the entire Slashdot article. We then select the subgraph corresponding to those fragments in the target topic. From the fragment quotation sub-graph, we are then able to extract features for disagreement detection such as the number of connections, total number of fragments, and the average path length between nodes which we hypothesize to be useful. We additionally extract the h-index (Gomez et al., 2008) and average branching ratio per fragment of the topic from the simpler reply-to conversational structure. In total, there are 8 FQG features."

In the filtering, we remove stop words and any words that occur in fewer than three topics. This helps to prevent topic specific words from being selected, and limits the number of possible matches slightly. Additionally, we use a lexicon of bias-words (Recasens et al., 2013) to extract a bias-word frequency score over all posts in the topic as a separate feature."

In fact, these feature sets perform significantly better than a unigram/bigram baseline according to a paired t-test between the best classifiers for each set (p < 0.0001). The inclusion of rhetorical structure also significantly outperforms the \u201cbasic\u201d and \u201cbasic+N-grams\u201d feature baselines (which includes discourse markers, referrals, punctuation, bias word counts and structural features) with respect to both the F-score and accuracy (p < 0.02 for all feature sets with rhetorical features). Overall, the feature sets \u201cBasic+RhetAll\u201d and \u201cAll\u201d under the SVM+\u03c72 classifier perform best. This performance is also better than previously reported results for the ARGUE Corpus (Abbott et al., 2011), even though the basic and unigram/bigram features perform similarly to that reported in previous analyses.\nAs an additional check, we also conduct experiments on the \u201chigh confidence\u201d data (those topics with a confidence score greater than 0.75). These results are shown in Table 3. Clearly the basic features perform better on this subset of the samples, although the addition of rhetorical structure still provides significant improvement (p< 0.001).

Furthermore, we check whether the commonly selected features in each of our feature categories are similar to those found to be useful over the ARGUE corpus, as well as within other argument detection tasks in online forums.\nThe rhetorical features that are consistently selected are very well motivated in the context of argument detection. From the rhetorical structural features, we find COMPARISON relation features to be most commonly selected across all rhetorical feature sets. Other highly ranked features include the proportion of JOINT relations linking different authors, EXPLANATION relations between different authors, and the average depth of ELABORATION relations.\nThe COMPARISON relations are expected to in-\ndicate disagreement as motivated by theoretical considerations (Horn, 1989). The importance of other rhetorical relation features can also be explained by examining conversations in which they appear. In particular, EXPLANATION relations often link authors who share viewpoints in a debate, especially when one author is trying to support the claim of another. The JOINT relations are also very well motivated. In the extreme case, conversations with a very high number of JOINT relations between different users are usually news based. The high proportion of these relations indicates that many users have added information to the conversation about a specific item, such as adding new suggested videogame features to an ongoing list. Fewer JOINT relations seem to indicate disagreement, especially when found in conjunction with COMPARISON relations between different users. This appears to generally indicate that users are taking sides in a debate, and commenting specifically on evidence which supports their viewpoint.\nThe average depth of ELABORATION relations reveals how deep the perceived connections are between users in a conversation over time. Deeper ELABORATION connections seem to indicate that the conversation is more cohesive. Alone, this does not signify disagreement/agreement but does seem to signify argument-style over news-style dialogues. This is particularly helpful for differentiating between articles with many COMPARISON relations, as COMPARISON may be present in both news-style dialogues (e.g. comparing citation styles) as well as argument style dialogues (e.g. arguing over which of two operating systems is superior).\nFor the combined sentiment and rhetorical relations, range and variance in ELABORATION, CONTRAST and ATTRIBUTION within the same post are found to be the most informative features. Additionally, neither ATTRIBUTION nor CONTRAST are useful features when only their structural information is considered. In the case of ATTRIBUTION, we hypothesize that the added sentiment score within the post differentiates between a neutral attribution (which would not signify disagreement) and a negative or positive attribution (which may signify disagreement). For CONTRAST, the added sentiment helps to distinguish between responses such as \u201cWe will be trying the Microsoft software. We won\u2019t, however, be able to test the Apple equivalent.\u201d and \u201cWe will be trying the Microsoft software. We won\u2019t, however, be trying the inferior Apple equivalent.\u201d where the second example more likely signals, or even provokes, disagreement.\nOutside of the rhetorical features, the discourse markers which are found to be the most useful in our experiments agree with those found in the ARGUE corpus (Abbott et al., 2011). Namely, \u2018oh\u2019, \u2018but\u2019, \u2018because\u2019 and \u2018and\u2019 are discovered to be the most informative features. We also find the aggregated discourse marker frequency count in the first part of each post to be useful.\nPrevious analysis on Slashdot as a social network (Gomez et al., 2008) suggests that the hindex of the conversation is relevant for detecting controversy in a posted article. We include the h-index as part of the Fragment Quotation Graph feature set, but surprisingly do not find this to be a useful feature. This may be due to our corpus involving relatively shallow conversational trees - the maximum h-index across all topics is three.\nComparing to Mishne and Glance\u2019s work, we also find quotations, questions and sentiment range near the beginning of a post to be very informative features. These are often selected across all feature sets which include the \u201cbasic\u201d set.\nThe topics most often misclassified across all feature sets are those with relatively few sentences. In these cases, the rhetorical structure is not very well defined, and there is much less content available for detecting quotes, punctuation and referrals. Additionally, the feature sets which only use rhetorical and sentiment features consistently misclassify the same set of conversations (those that have lower quality discourse trees with few connections). When combined with the \u201cbasic\u201d feature set, these errors are mitigated, and the topics which the \u201cbasic\u201d features miss are picked up by the rhetorical features. This leads to the best overall accuracy and F-score."

            "text": "A major source of error in detecting disagreement arises because of inaccuracies in our discourse parser. In particular, document-level discourse parsing is a challenging task, with relatively few parsers available at the time of this analysis (Joty et al., 2013; Hernault et al., 2010). We chose to use the discourse parser developed by Joty et al. which both identifies elementary discourse units in a text, and then builds a document-level discourse tree using Conditional Random Fields. Because their approach uses an optimal parsing algorithm as opposed to a greedy parsing algorithm, they are able to achieve much higher accuracies in relation and structure identification than other available parsers. Here, results from their parser on the standard RST-DT dataset are presented since there is no currently available dialogic corpora to compare to.\nExamining the relation labels confusion matrix\nfor the discourse parser in Figure 2, some of the chosen rhetorical features make even more sense. In particular, the confusion of ELABORATION and EXPLANATION may account for the perceived importance of ELABORATION relations in the analysis. Likewise, CAUSE (which may be present when users attribute positive or negative qualities to an entity, signalling disagreement) is often confused with JOINT and ELABORATION which were often picked as important features by our classifiers."

            "text": "In this paper, we have described a new set of features for detecting disagreement in online blog forums. By treating a written conversation as a series of linked monologues, we can apply a document level discourse parser to extract a discourse tree for the conversation. We then aggregate this information in a relation graph, which allows us to capture post-level rhetorical relations between users. Combining this approach with sentiment features shows significantly improved performance in both accuracy and F-score over a baseline consisting of structural and lexical features as well as referral counts, punctuation, and discourse markers. In building our new crowd-sourced corpus from Slashdot, we have also shown the challenges of detecting subtle disagreement in a dataset that contains a significant number of news-style discus-\nsions. In future work, we will improve sentiment features by considering methods to detect opiniontopic pairs in conversation, similar to Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009). Additionally, we will incorporate generalized dependency and POS features (Abbott et al., 2011), which were not used in this analysis due to the very small number of training samples in our dataset. The fragment quotation graph features did not perform as well as we expected, and in future work we would like to investigate this further. Furthermore, we will also explore how to create a discourse tree from the thread structure of a conversation (instead of from its temporal structure), and verify whether this improves the accuracy of the relation graphs, especially when the temporal structure is not representative of the reply-to relationships.\nFinally, we plan to apply our novel feature set to other corpora (e.g., ARGUE) in order to study the utility of these features across genres and with respect to the accuracy of the discourse parser. This may provide insights into where discourse parsers can be most effectively used, as well as how to modify parsers to better capture rhetorical relations between participants in conversation."
