    "abstractText": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and personality changes that ultimately lead to dementia. Currently, 50 million people worldwide suffer from dementia related to AD, and the pathogenesis underlying AD pathology and cognitive decline is unknown. While AD is primarily a neurological disease of the brain, individuals with AD often experience intestinal disorders, and gut abnormalities have been implicated as a major risk factor in the development of AD and relevant dementia. However, the mechanisms that mediate gut injury and contribute to the vicious cycle between gut abnormalities and brain injury in AD remain unknown. In the present study, a bioinformatics analysis was performed on the proteomics data of variously aged AD mouse colon tissues. We found that levels of integrin \u03b23 and \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal), two markers of cellular senescence, increased with age in the colonic tissue of mice with AD. The advanced artificial intelligence (AI)-based prediction of AD risk also demonstrated the association between integrin \u03b23 and \u03b2-gal and AD phenotypes. Moreover, we showed that elevated integrin \u03b23 levels were accompanied by senescence phenotypes and immune cell accumulation in AD mouse colonic tissue. Further, integrin \u03b23 genetic downregulation abolished upregulated senescence markers and inflammatory responses in colonic epithelial cells in conditions associated with AD. We provide a new understanding of the molecular actions underpinning inflammatory responses during AD and suggest integrin \u03b23 may function as novel target mediating gut abnormalities in this disease.",

            "text": "As a prevalent neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is categorized by learning disabilities, personality changes, memory loss, and finally culminates in dementia [1]. Globally, more than 46.8 million individuals have AD-related dementia, and by 2050, this number is anticipated to increase to 131.5 million [2,3]. In recent decades, despite advances in our understanding of AD pathogenesis, cognitive deficit and cell damage mechanisms associated with AD remain unclear, while effective treatments preventing or limiting AD progression are unknown. While AD is primarily a neurological disease of the brain, individuals with AD often experience debilitating gastrointestinal tract (GIT) disorders, including fecal incontinence, constipation, intestinal volvulus, and colon dilatation [4,5]. Both patients with AD and AD experimental models experience altered gut microbiome composition, which is related to significant pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression profiles [6\u20139]. Notably, individuals with abnormal GIT disorders show rapid cognitive decline [10], while antibiotic-mediated\nInt. J. Mol.

Sci. 2023, 24, 5697 2 of 21\nperturbations in the gut microbiome can modulate dementia onset and amyloid accumulation in AD animals [11,12]. Recently, a longitudinal study reported that individuals with inflammatory bowel disease had more than a six-fold increased risk of AD and a possible five-fold increased incidence of all dementia types [13]. Furthermore, recent genetic data also suggested that GIT disorders shared common genetic causes with AD and were considerable AD risk factors [14]. Additionally, some gut microbiota bacterial products, such as short-chain fatty acid metabolites, induced neuroinflammation, increased amyloid plaque deposition, and promoted cognitive alterations in transgenic AD mice [9,15]. Similarly, gut microbiota removal was also reported to reduce neuropathology in transgenic AD mice [9,16]. Despite increasing investigations showing that gut abnormalities are implicated in AD etiology [17,18], the signals that induce gut injury and promote the vicious cycle between gut abnormalities and brain injury in AD remain unknown. The permanent loss of somatic cell proliferative potential, thereby preventing damaged cell propagation, is called cell senescence. The process is characterized by chromatin remodeling, DNA damage, cell cycle inhibitor pathway (p21/p53 and/or p16/pRb) activation, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) development, and senescenceassociated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-Gal) activity [19,20]. Under normal conditions, different inflammatory proteins and metalloproteases which comprise SASP\u2019s are secreted from senescent cells, after which SASP\u2019s activate immune responses to eliminate senescent cells and promote tissue homeostasis [19]. However, during aging and age-related diseases, e.g., AD, senescent cells accumulate during disease progression and induce severe SASPs, causing inflammatory responses, cytokine accumulation, and increased reactive oxygen species which degenerate tissue [21]. Thus, senescent cell depletion in aging tissue may limit age-related pathological progress and severity, and even ameliorate lifespan [21,22]. In previous studies, senescent cell removal using pharmacological or genetic approaches has reversed senescent phenotypes, suppressed inflammation, and attenuated cognitive deficits and neuronal loss in different animal AD models [23\u201325]. During aging, the GIT epithelium becomes more permeable due to proinflammatory cytokine release, which increases gut permeability and alters gut microbiota composition [26,27]. Recently, age-dependent increases in senescent p21+ cells were observed in different human organs, including colon tissue, and indicated associations between senescent cell accumulation and intestinal aging [28]. In particular, the cellular senescence signatures were identified in intestinal tissue via elevated p21 levels and SA-\u03b2-gal activity in accelerated aging and wild-type (WT) mouse models [29]. Similarly, in aged mice, these senescence markers were upregulated in intestinal epithelial organoids when compared with younger mice [30]. Therefore, intestinal epithelial cells exhibit age-dependent cell senescence, which may be implicated in gut homeostasis disruption and intestinal inflammation. However, in pathophysiological terms, it is unclear if cell senescence occurs in the intestines of mice with AD and associates with AD development. In this study, we investigated age-dependent degeneration in the intestinal tissue of transgenic AD mice. Unbiased proteomic and biochemical analyses showed that integrin \u03b23 and \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal), two markers implicated in cellular senescence, were increased with age in AD mouse colonic tissue. Elevated integrin \u03b23 levels were accompanied by increased p21 and SA-\u03b2-gal activity, induced SASPs, and accumulated inflammatory cell infiltration in AD mice. Integrin \u03b23 was highly enriched in intestinal epithelial cells and its elevation induced cell senescence signatures in colonic epithelial cells. Notably, the genetic downregulation of integrin \u03b23 abolished upregulated cell senescence markers and inflammatory responses in colonic epithelial cells under AD conditions. Our results suggest that integrin \u03b23-mediated intestinal cell senescence may represent a molecular signal that triggers intestinal inflammation and tissue degeneration in AD, thereby contributing to AD progression.\nInt.

            "text": "While previous studies have reported intestinal microbiota alteration associations with AD development [5,7,17,26], it currently remains unclear how intestinal tissue integrity changes occur in line with disease progression. Colon dilatation is correlated with human AD [4,5], and 5XFAD mouse colons appear to be most affected by AD stimuli [31]. Therefore, we first characterized colon enteric network density in 5XFAD mice at 3- (early pathological stage), 6- (advanced pathological stage), and 9-months-old (late pathological stage). Transgenic 5XFAD mice have five AD mutations which increase A\u03b2x-42 levels and accelerate plaque formation. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the model was formed by introducing amyloid precursor proteins (APPs) of the Swedish, Florida, and London mutations, and also PS1 L286V and M146L mutations into APP (695) and PS1 cDNAs [32]. We used this model as APP is expressed in human AD and mouse AD model guts [11,33\u201336] and several AD traits are present in the 5XFAD model, including gut alterations [11,31,32]. From H&E staining, age-dependent decreases in the cross-sectional length of colon mucosal folds were identified in 5XFAD mice relative to age-matched WT controls (Figure 1A). While colon muscular thickness was similar between all mice at 3- and 6-months-old, significant decreases in thickness were observed in 9-month-old 5XFAD animals (Figure 1A). Using Alcian blue staining, we consistently observed age-dependent intestinal content loss in 5XFAD mice when compared with age-matched WT controls. Alcian blue-stained goblet cell fractions were progressively shortened in 5XFAD mouse colons and showed approximately 50% loss at 9-months-old (Figure 1B), which is consistent with goblet cell degeneration in human AD gut tissues [37]. To exclude the possibility that enteric network density loss was caused by APP overexpression in 5XFAD mice, we examined colon structures in APPNL-F-G knock-in (KI) mice which expressed human AD mutations at a humanized mouse APP locus; mutations were driven by the APP endogenous promoter, therefore animals developed neurocognitive defects and amyloid plaques [38]. This KI construct had a humanized A\u03b2 region and three pathogenic Swedish \u201cNL\u201d, Iberian \u201cF\u201d, and Arctic \u201cG\u201d mutations [38]. Mice expressed endogenous APP levels and avoided possible artifacts mediated by APP overexpression while simultaneously generating increased pathogenic A\u03b2 levels [38]. In our study, these KI mice exhibited age-dependent colon mucosal fold and goblet cell degeneration, with severe loss at 9-months-old (Figure 1C,D). Additionally, the overall small intestine and colon length in 5XFAD mice was significantly shorter when compared with age-matched WT controls (Figure 1E). Collectively, we observed age-dependent intestinal tissue degeneration in APP-associated mouse AD models.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 5697 4 of 21Int. J. ol.

            "text": "To investigate the molecular basis underlying intestinal tissue damage in AD mice, we profiled the proteome in 5XFAD mouse colonic tissue at different times to reflect disease progression. Proximal and distal colonic tissue were harvested from 5XFAD mice at 3-, 6-, and 9-months-old, and label-free LC-MS/MS analyses were conducted (Figure 2A). Colonic tissues from age-matched WT controls served as comparisons. From these analyses, proteins with at least a two-fold expression change in 5XFAD versus WT controls were selected (i.e., >2-fold down- or up-regulation relative to WT animals). Using these criteria, 214, 88, and 483 proteins were identified in 3-, 6-, and 9-month-old 5XFAD mouse colonic tissue datasets, respectively (Figure 2B). The volcano plots for each dataset highlighted a dramatic accumulation of significantly differentially expressed proteins with progression of time (5XFAD/WT 0.5 \u2265 FC \u2265 2, depicted as blue and red dots) (Figure 2C). At 3, 6, and 9 months, 64, 42, and 161 proteins were upregulated, while 150, 46, and 322 proteins were downregulated, respectively (Figure 2C). To examine biological pathways which were transiently associated with AD, separate enrichment pathway analyses were exclusively performed for proteins dysregulated at all times points. Similar pathways were also identified as significantly dysregulated at 3 and 6 months in 5XFAD mice; \u201cimmune system processes\u201d (p = 4.5*10\u22127 at 3 months and p = 5.83*10\u22126 at 6 months) was ranked as the top enrichment pathway (Figure 2D). In the 9 month 5XFAD colon tissue dataset, vesicle-mediated transport (p = 8.53*10\u221213) and lipid metabolic processes (p = 9.82*10\u221212) were the top two enriched pathways (Figure 2D). Immune responses, vesicle transportation, and lipid metabolism mutually affect each other in AD [39\u201341]. This cross-sectional proteomic analysis suggested that 5XFAD mouse colonic tissue underwent time-sensitive and complex proteomic alterations during AD development, with striking shifts away from early immune response signatures at 3 and 6 months to dysregulated lipid metabolism at 9 months (Figure 2D). Across time points, we identified 28 differentially expressed proteins (Figure 3). A graphical comparison of GO Biological Pathway terms on these proteins showed that \u201cimmune system processes\u201d, \u201cplatelet aggregation\u201d, and plasminogen activation\u201d were the top three protein enrichment pathways (Figure 3A). Subsequent Reactome analyses identified \u201cintegrin signaling\u201d as an additional top enrichment pathway (Figure 3B). We matched these 28 proteins to the DisGeNET AD biomarker database (CUI: C002395) and identified nine AD-associated protein biomarkers (ITGB3, \u03b2Gal, FETUA, PSB9, DCTN4, HA11, HA1B, AiAT4, and A1AT2) (Figure 3C). To identify relationships between these 28 proteins and AD, we performed advanced artificial intelligence-based computational analyses (Figure 3). Using our KG-prediction approach [42,43], we ranked biomedical entities using our context-sensitive network-based algorithm. In total, 19,533 proteins were analyzed, and as shown (Figure 3D), the top ten predicted proteins from the 28 proteins that were significantly associated with AD (p \u2264 0.01 vs. random expected ranking) were ranked. Interestingly, three proteins (ITGB3, FETUA, and \u03b2GAL) that were significantly related to AD overlapped with proteins from the DisGeNET AD biomarker database (Figure 3D). Both ITGB3 and \u03b2-gal showed age-dependent increases in 5XFAD mouse colonic tissue (Figure 3). \u03b2-gal is a glycoside hydrolase enzyme used as a cell senescence marker [19,28]. Integrin \u03b23 belongs to the integrin family and has key functions in migration, cell proliferation, immune responses, microenvironmental homeostasis via extracellular vesicles, and tissue repair [44,45].

Immunofluorescence staining also showed significant rises in integrin \u03b23 expression levels in 5XFAD mice when compared with WT controls (Figure 5B). Additionally, increased integrin \u03b23 immuno-intensity levels were observed in pan-cytokeratin+ colon epithelium (Figure 5B). These data validated our proteomic data and supported increased integrin \u03b23 and \u03b2-galactosidase expression in 5XFAD mouse colons. As integrin \u03b23 is involved in cell senescence [46], we hypothesized if increased integrin \u03b23 levels were associated with colon senescence in AD. Ki67 contributes to normal cell cycle processes and is a marker of cell cycling but not of resting cells [47,48]. Decreased Ki67 levels and enhanced senescence-related \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-Gal) activity are widely used to identify senescent cells [47\u201350]. In our study, Ki67+ cell percentages were significantly decreased in 5XFAD mouse colon crypts (Figure 5B). Moreover, 5XFAD mouse colons showed significantly increased SA-\u03b2-gal activities when compared with agematched controls (Figure 5C). Thus, epithelial cell senescence had occurred in 5XFAD mouse colons. Notably, integrin \u03b23 signals were enriched around Ki67+ nuclei, while increased integrin \u03b23 intensity levels corresponded with decreased Ki67 signals in epithelial cells from 5XFAD mouse intestines (Figure 5B). Both p21- and p16-induced levels robustly reflect cell senescence [19,21]. In our study, p21 mRNA levels were significantly increased in 5XFAD mouse colons when compared with WT controls (Figure 5D), suggesting p21-dependent senescent events. Additionally, cytokines implicated in SASPs, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 (CCL2), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) were significantly induced in 5XFAD mouse colonic tissue when compared with WT controls (Figure 5E). Collectively, strong cell senescence signatures were identified in 5XFAD mouse colons and were associated with increased integrin \u03b23 levels in the epithelium."

Moreover, integrin \u03b23 overexpression enhanced SA-\u03b2-gal activity and induced p21and SASP-associated cytokine expression in colonic epithelial cells (Figure 6B\u2013D).

            "text": "Gut abnormalities contribute to AD pathogenesis and development; however, detailed mechanisms and cell phenotypes implicated in these abnormalities remain unknown. In our study, for the first time, we identified cell senescence in the gut tissue of transgenic AD mice, concomitant with intestinal inflammation and tissue degeneration. Our unbiased proteomic and biochemical analyses showed that increased integrin \u03b23 levels were implicated in upregulated cell senescence and gut inflammation in AD mouse models. These findings suggest new intestinal inflammation and tissue damage mechanisms in AD. Persistent and chronic inflammation are prominent traits in AD and are hypothesized to mediate cognitive decline and neurodegeneration [8,17,51]. A recent study reported that chronic mild gut inflammation, induced by low dextran sodium sulfate concentrations, accelerated cognitive dysfunction onset and toxic protein aggregation in a 3xTg AD mouse model [52]. In our study, in 5XFAD and APP KI mouse colons, multiple cytokines and inflammatory cell numbers had age-dependently increased. Our cross-sectional proteomic analysis consistently showed that immune response was the top altered pathway in 5XFAD mice colons with respect to time. Our data suggested that immune cell activation in AD was putatively not limited to brain glial cells but included other tissues, consistent with the concept that inflammatory changes in AD brains are possibly associated with immune alterations in peripheral tissues [53]. There is limited evidence to suggest that the bulk proteome, transcriptome, or metabolome in 5XFAD mice tissue show age-dependent alterations. This could partially explain why less proteins were identified in the colon tissue of 6-month-old mice compared to 3-month-old mice. The goal of conducting proteomics analyses on colon tissues in our study was to identify potential molecular mechanisms that underlie intestinal inflammation and AD-related alterations. These mechanisms likely play a role in the prodromal/early symptomatic stage and across all stages of AD. Thus, our analysis focused only on enriched proteins that consistently changed over time, as depicted in Figure 3. Intriguingly, AD mouse intestines underwent significant cell senescence, accompanied by tissue inflammation. Cell senescence activation-induced SASPs which were manifested by pro-inflammatory cytokine release to neighboring tissue. Chronic SASP-associated inflammation may have then promoted inflammatory environments in the gut, which possibly enhanced gut permeability, immune activation, and gut microbiome composition [54,55]. Additionally, gut microbiota pathogens can upregulate gut and systemic inflammatory reactions, increase intestinal permeability, and contribute to AD-associated neuropathology and cognitive decline [11,17]. Thus, intestinal cell senescence may initialize inflammation and promote the vicious cycle between gut tissue abnormalities and microbiota alterations.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 5697 13 of 21\nCell senescence is regulated by intracellular and extracellular signals as well as the extracellular matrix (ECM) [46,56,57]. Integrins are the most common ECM regulators; they are heterodimeric cell surface transmembrane receptors which support signal transduction and cell adhesion [45]. Integrin signaling also regulates many cell functions and is involved in neurological disorders, cancer, and wound healing [58]. Integrin \u03b23 was recently identified as a regulator of p21-dependent cell senescence in human primary fibroblasts [46]. We identified integrin \u03b23 from our proteomics analyses of 5XFAD mice colons and showed its protein levels increased in an age-dependent manner and were correlated with gut inflammation at early AD stages. This observation was supported by integrin \u03b23 overexpression which increased cell senescence markers, whereas integrin \u03b23 knock-down diminished APP-induced cell senescence in colonic epithelial cells. Moreover, p21\u2014but not p16\u2014was significantly induced naturally with enhanced integrin \u03b23 and cell senescence signature levels, consistent with a previous report [46]. In the future, we will determine the impact of gut epithelial integrin \u03b23-mediated cell senescence on in vivo AD-associated pathophysiology in AD animal models. In summary, by investigating gut tissue integrity and the proteome in AD mice, integrin \u03b23-mediated cell senescence was implicated in gut inflammation and intestinal tissue degeneration in AD models. We provide a new understanding of the molecular resources required for inflammatory responses during AD, and propose integrin \u03b23 as a novel target mediating gut abnormalities in AD."

Once learned, the predicting module concatenated entity and relationship embeddings and used three operations to extract topological and\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 5697 16 of 21\nsemantic information to generate linked predictions. When inputting a disease entity (e.g., AD) and \u201cDisease-Associate-Gene\u201d, predicting modules generated rich heterogeneous interactions between the entity and relation embedding to determine novel disease\u2013gene interactions."
