The Teruel Orthorexia Nervosa scale was used to measure orthorexia nervosa. The following scales state self-esteem and religiosity were used to measure self-esteem.\nResults Sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, marital status, household crowding index, body mass index and education) were entered in the mediation model as confounding variables. Higher religiosity was significantly associated with higher state self-esteem (Beta = 0.07), while higher state self-esteem was significantly associated with lower identification of those that exhibited ON tendencies or symptoms (Beta= -0.11).\nConclusion A high state self-esteem was correlated with a lower level of orthorexia nervosa. Higher religiosity was shown to be associated with higher self-esteem, which in turn was associated with a decrease in the scores of orthorexia nervosa.\nKeywords Orthorexia nervosa, Self-esteem, Religiosity, Lebanon"

            "text": "Self-esteem, described by the positive or negative value people attribute to themselves, is considered to be a basic need for humans [1, 2]. The construct of self-esteem, referred to as a trait, can be considered stable and global, includes the personal judgement of one\u2019s value or worth [3]. Crouch & Straub (1983) have argued that a person\u2019s trait self-esteem is developed and relatively unchangeable in adulthood, and hence this self-esteem trait is relatively stable [4]. The global aspect of self-esteem can be explained by the presence of both positive and negative feelings one might have towards themselves as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSS) [5]. Global selfesteem, as explained by previous research, can include several domains such as: social, cognitive and physical self-esteems [6, 7]. Self-esteem is a flexible construct, it goes through fluctuations or small changes, where Heatherton and Polivy in 1991 distinguished it as a state of self-esteem [8]. Self-esteem state fluctuates depending on people approval by others [9] and consists of how individuals evaluate their self-worth. Unlike general or trait self-esteem which could be considered to be stable over time, Crouch and Straub suggested that a person\u2019s trait self-esteem can be established by adulthood [4, 10]. On the other hand, Butler and colleagues referred to \u201cself-esteem lability\u201d to explain the changes in the state self-esteem in different contexts or situations [11].\nFor instance, the self-esteem state can refer to this change in self-esteem when someone is sick or unemployed [4]. This close relationship between trait selfesteem and state self-esteem is reduced when something might threaten the ego [8]. The reason for distinguishing between these two forms in the current study was to evaluate the difference between the trait self-esteem and the state self-esteem in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic crisis happening in Lebanon. We hypothesized that the state self-esteem would be more significantly associated with Orthorexia Nervosa (ON). Moreover, previous research has found no significant association between trait self-esteem and ON while using the RSS which evaluated the self-esteem trait [5, 12, 13]. In-addition, there is absence in previous research that evaluated state self-esteem with ON or any form of self-esteem as a mediator between ON and religiosity.\nSelf-esteem can also be correlated with self-image, where a negative self-image of oneself was correlated with a negative self-esteem [14]. In fact, self-image is usually shaped by primary attachment styles or persons and it plays an important role in the interactions with others [15]. People with eating disorders scored more negative scores of self-images than controls [16, 17].\nIn 2019, a study showed that a higher score of eating disorder was associated with a lower self-esteem [18]. Previous literature showed that females with eating\ndisorders were associated with a lower self-esteem where individuals may feel the pressure to fit society\u2019s norms of beauty ideals [19, 20, 21]. A higher self-esteem was positively associated with a higher general wellbeing [22], whereas a low self-esteem was linked with more substance abuse/use as well as eating disorders [23].\nRecent literature links mental health as well as other domains to religion [24, 25]. A cross-sectional study argued that religion has a great effect on human health and could provide people with a positive mental state [26]. In terms of self-esteem, previous research showed that higher levels of religiosity were associated with higher self-esteem score [27, 28]. Religious beliefs were positively associated with a higher self-esteem as well as better mental health [29].\nJust like self-esteem, eating disorders were associated with spirituality, where strong religious beliefs were correlated with lower concerns about the body as well as disordered eating [30]. In a study conducted on Dutch health professionals, a 50-year-old female stated that the insecurities are emerging and one of the factors was that religion was gone and people were looking for a way to deal with the insecurities and fall back on, like ON or even Anorexia Nervosa [31]. To this date, there was no study that evaluated the association of religiosity with Orthorexia Nervosa. Religiosity can refer to several aspects associated with religious beliefs as well as involvements [32]. The beliefs would refer to a reverence for a deity and the involved would be engaging in activities or services related to this faith [33]. Previous authors have stated that religiosity also referred to as religiousness can be defined as the \u201cstrength of one\u2019s connection to or conviction for their religion\u201d [34]. Religion in this case is related to the practices, beliefs and behaviors associated with the idea of the \u201ctranscendent\u201d that can be practiced individually or within a community [35].\nON, still not classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorder 5 (DSM-5), nor in the International Classification of Diseases, Eleventh Revision (ICD-11), can be explained as beliefs and behaviors that are obsessive and compulsive - respectively - in regards to eating behaviors [36]. The main concern of people with ON would be the healthy quality of the diet rather than the quantity, as in making sure of the presence of nutrients, preservatives or the use of pesticides, etc. [36\u201338]. This unhealthy obsession with healthy eating and strict dieting might lead to negative nutritional repercussions [36].\nON tendencies, according to Renee McGregor, are a self-development obsession rather than only striving for a perfect weight. The author describes the origin of ON tendencies to when people challenge themselves by pushing their limits in order to gain self-esteem [39]. In a previous research, bloggers identified with ON tendencies\nexpressed that they felt the need to be in control and to reach perfection which maintained their disordered eating. This \u201cpunishing drive for perfection and control\u201d as identified by the authors, pushed the participants to obsessively be in control of their diet and exercise by implementing strict rules [40]. Some participants shared that they became judgmental while using downward comparisons in regards of other people\u2019s health life choices which brought them a sense of superiority. People with a low self-esteem might be particularly interested in social comparison which might increase their satisfaction [41, 42]. Moreover, self-esteem was previously shown to be a predictor for ON tendencies where higher scores on the ON scale were correlated with lower levels of self-esteem [43].\nPeople with ON may also experience emotional distress as well as social and educational impairments on both physical and physiological levels [44, 45]. In addition, they may experience a high level of frustration when they are not satisfied with their food practices and a feeling of guilt when they do not follow their diet or transgress it [46]. ON was also associated with disordered eating attitudes [47], such as a severe restriction over food, unhealthy behaviors as well as diet habits to lose or maintain weight [48].\nThe association of ON and gender seemed to be controversial across several studies. Two studies found that ON tendencies were more prevalent in women than men [49, 50], whereas two other studies found the opposite [37, 51]. Few more studies found no significant correlations between the two [13, 52, 53]. A previous study found a significant association between ON and marital status in a Lebanese sample whereas another cross-cultural study conducted between Lebanon and Germany found no association between the two [54, 55]. Moreover,\nBona and colleagues (2021) found that ON tendencies were more present in younger participants [43].No previous significant correlation was found between ON and other sociodemographic data such as education and household crowding index.\nThe following conceptual model (Fig.\u00a01) represents the association between religiosity and ON with the mediating role of self-esteem. When an individual has a peaceful approach and has a higher level of religiosity, the less they want to validate their looks or rely on an uncomfortable wish to look healthy. The greater the religious awareness is, the lower the ON would be. Self-esteem can be associated with the negative feelings and the worries to appear in a healthy bod, and this association could be valid through the mediator role of spiritual awareness [43].\u00a0A higher level of intrinsic religion can play a protective factor against eating disorders [56]. As religious beliefs can help increase self-esteem [29], some evidence suggests that an enhanced self-esteem can play a protective factor against eating disorders [57]. With Lebanon being a religious country, religiosity was extensively studied in association of several mental health and psychology concepts such as suicidal risk, depression, addiction [58\u201360], the current study aimed to evaluate the association of religiosity with ON with a mediating role of self-esteem.\nLebanon is considered to be a diverse country as per religions where we find Islam and Christianity as well as other religions (https://www.state.gov/reports/2019report-on-international-religious-freedom/lebanon/ accessed on 6 March, 2022). Most Lebanese would consider God as being full of power and the source of miracles, and religion plays a vital role in their life [61]. Previous research has shown the importance of religion in people\u2019s life and illnesses where participants felt that their illness had a purpose. The authors of this previous\nstudy also recommended the integration of spiritual care to make sure patients have a better quality of life [62]. In a sample of 519 Lebanese individuals, the prevalence of ON tendencies (using the Dusseldorf Orthorexia Scale) was found to be present in 8.4% of the entire sample and 17.5% of the sample was at risk of developing ON [54]. In another study conducted on Lebanese individuals, the authors have highlighted the need for social awareness and behavioral interventions to treat ON [63]. The importance of this social awareness would be for people to be more vocal about eating disorders and especially about ON in order to be able to plan interventions and treatment plans accordingly.\nWith this being said and the scarce literature about ON in the Arab countries, the goal of the present study was to assess the association of higher religiosity with lower ON in a sample of the Lebanese population with the mediating role of self-esteem. We expected that selfesteem would mediate the association between religiosity and ON. Moreover, we used state self-esteem in this current study to study the fluctuation of self-esteem in the moment in which participants filled the questionnaire. This would give us a better idea on how they would feel at the time."

Previous studies have found no significant association between trait self-esteem scores and ON tendencies [12] and other studies have found that ON tendencies were positively associated with trait self-esteem [36]. This could be due to the assessment of trait self-esteem as in the current study where only state self-esteem was significantly negatively associated with ON tendencies. Some authors have found that having a high score of selfesteem reduced the tendency to healthy eating obsession making low self-esteem a susceptible predisposing factor for ON tendencies [77].\nThe results of our study found that state-self-esteem had a significant indirect effect between religiosity and ON. We predicted in our hypothesis a mediating role of self-esteem between religiosity and ON. Religiosity in this case refers to both religious beliefs and engagement in religious activities affiliated to one\u2019s religion and can also be referred to as religiousness. Bona and colleagues, found that the higher the spiritual awareness was, the less likely the participants were found to have symptoms of orthorexia. People who have a high score on spirituality would generally not be concerned about other people\u2019s opinions [78]. This would mean that with this spiritual approach, people\u2019s self-esteem would not be low as they would not engage in restrictive diets or preoccupy themselves with healthy eating habits, which aligns with our theoretical framework and our initial hypothesis. Selfesteem could play a protective role against adverse situations and help reduce the impact of negative events [79, 80]. Almost 70% of reports, showed that religious individuals have higher levels of self-esteem [81] which can\nbe interpreted by the fact that positive image of God and attending church duties, predicted higher levels of selfesteem among young people [82, 83]. This aligns with the results of this current study showing the association of religiosity with self-esteem. These results also align with previous research in which religious comfort and more religiosity were positively correlated with higher selfesteem [81, 84]. People might use self-esteem as a way to help themselves in adverse situations or dangers coming from the environment [85]. As no previous study evaluated the association of state self-esteem with religiosity, we assume that in the midst of the current situation in Lebanon, the fluctuation of people\u2019s state self-esteem was significantly correlated with religiosity as people might be using religiosity as a way to cope with the daily stress. Another interpretation of the significant association of state self-esteem as mediator might be due to the many challenges faced by the Lebanese community on a daily basis. Alongside with the economic inflation in Lebanon, COVID-19, social insecurity, political instability as well as the increase in unemployment could be possibly associated with this fluctuation of state self-esteem. As trait self-esteem is considered to be a stable overtime it might not change immediately after challenging situations. Previous research has indeed found significant associations between the above-mentioned challenges in Lebanon with mental health aspects and mental health disorders [86\u201389]. This could, in some way, explain how state selfesteem \u2013 that can be changeable from one context to another \u2013 mediated the association of religiosity and ON."

Religiosity should be given more focus in the clinical practice, especially in Lebanon as it is considered as a religious country. This approach could be used by clinicians in their treatment plans in order to help some of their clients better."
