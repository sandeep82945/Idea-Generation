            "text": "The double-\u03b2 decay is a nuclear process that changes the charge of a nucleus by two units through the simultaneous \u03b2-decay of two constituent neutrons to protons. The twoneutrino double-\u03b2 decay (2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) is a rare second-order weak interaction process occurring with emission of two electrons and two antineutrinos. It was observed for several nuclear isotopes [1,2].\nThe community\u2019s interest in the double-\u03b2 decay is particularly motivated by the search for its hypothetical neutrinoless mode (0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) [3]. This process violates the lepton number conservation and is only possible if the neutrino has mass and is a Majorana particle [4], i.e. \u03bd \u2261 \u03bd\u0304. The discovery of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 would indicate the physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM).\nThe rates of two-neutrino and neutrinoless double-\u03b2 decay may be expressed as\n1/T 2\u03bd1/2 = G2\u03bdg4A|M2\u03bd |2 , (1) 1/T 0\u03bd1/2 = G0\u03bdg4A|M0\u03bd |2\u3008\u03b7\u30092 , (2)\nwhere G2\u03bd,0\u03bd are the phase space factors, gA is the axial vector coupling constant, M2\u03bd,0\u03bd are the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for the corresponding decay modes, and \u3008\u03b7\u3009 is a parameter of the underlying BSM physics model (in the case of the commonly considered mass mechanism of the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay, the exchange of a light Majorana neutrino, \u3008\u03b7\u3009 is the effective neutrino mass). The phase space factors can be accurately calculated while the model-dependent NME calculations have a substantial theoretical uncertainty. The measurement of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay half-life provides valuable information for nuclear structure models used in NME calculations.\nThe double-\u03b2 decay can proceed through transitions either to the ground state or to excited states of the daughter nucleus. The latter occurs at a lower rate because of its smaller transition energy Q\u03b2\u03b2 leading to the correspondingly suppressed phase space factor. Nevertheless, the measurement of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay to excited states provides supplementary information for nuclear models. Additionally, in the case of the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay discovery, the ratio of half-lives for transitions to the 0+ first excited state and the ground state may allow the\ndominant decay mechanism to be determined [5]. Information on the results of experiments on the \u03b2\u03b2-decay to excited states of daughter nuclei can be found in [6].\nThe isotope 150Nd is one of the best candidates for neutrinoless \u03b2\u03b2-decay searches because of its high transition energy Q\u03b2\u03b2 = 3371 keV and highest phase space factor [7]. However, a modest isotopic abundance of 5.638(28)% and difficulties in isotopic enrichment limit its use in large-scale experiments.\nThe decay scheme of 150Nd to the 2+1 and 0 + 1 excited states is shown in Fig. 1. The half-life for the transition to the first 0+ excited state was first measured in 2004 [8]. These data were subsequently re-analysed, with the final result published in [9]. The measurements of this decay were obtained with \u03b3 -ray spectrometry using high-purity germanium detectors [9\u201311]; none of the previous measurements detected a signal with a 5\u03c3 statistical significance. For other excited states, only lower limits on the half-life were established; the best available limit for the transition to the 2+1 state set at 90% confidence level (C.L.) is T \u03b2\u03b21/2(2 + 1 ) > 2.2 \u00d7 1020 year [9].\nThe most precise measurement for the \u03b2\u03b2-decay of 150Nd to the ground state was performed by NEMO-3 [12]:\nT 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b21/2 (0 + g.s.) = [9.34 \u00b1 0.22 (stat)+0.62\u22120.60(syst)] \u00d7 1018 year.\n(3)\nIt is based on the data recorded for 5.25 years with 36.6 g of 150Nd. The same data set is used in this analysis."

The NEMO-3 detector, designed to search for the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay, uses both a tracking device and a calorimeter, which enables the direct detection of electrons, positrons, photons, and \u03b1-particles.\nA schematic view of the NEMO-3 detector is shown in Fig. 2. The detector was a hollow cylinder with a diameter of 5 m and a height of 3 m and was composed of 20 equal sectors. These hosted thin source foils of 7 different enriched \u03b2\u03b2decaying isotopes (100Mo, 82Se, 116Cd, 130Te, 150Nd, 96Zr, and 48Ca) with a total mass of about 10 kg.\nThe source foils were suspended vertically between two concentric cylindrical tracker volumes, parallel to the wires of the tracking detector. The tracking detector was composed of 6180 open octagonal drift cells arranged in 18 concentric layers, with 9 layers in each of the two volumes. The tracker was filled with a gas mixture of helium (94.9%), ethyl alcohol (4%), argon (1%), and water vapour (0.1%) at 7 mbar above atmospheric pressure. The drift cells operating in the Geiger mode enabled three-dimensional measurements of trajectories and decay vertices of charged particles. The average Geiger cell resolution was 0.5 mm in the horizontal plane and 8 mm in the vertical direction (parallel to the wires).\nThe tracking chamber was surrounded by a calorimeter composed of 1940 plastic scintillator blocks coupled to low-radioactivity 3-inch and 5-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). The calorimeter provided both time and energy measurements. The energy resolution of the calorimeter was \u03c3 = (5.8 \u2013 7.2)%, and the time resolution was \u03c3 = 250 ps for 1-MeV electrons.\nA vertical magnetic field of 25 Gauss inside the wire chamber was provided by a solenoidal coil. The detector was surrounded by the passive shielding consisting of 19-cm-thick iron plates to suppress the external \u03b3 -ray flux and also of\nborated water, paraffin, and wood to thermalize and absorb environmental neutrons. The experimental hall is located at a depth of 4800 m.w.e., to reduce the cosmic-ray flux.\nThe 150Nd foil was manufactured using Nd2O3 powder provided by the Institute for Nuclear Research of RAS in Moscow. Neodymium was enriched by electromagnetic separation to (91.0\u00b10.5)% of the isotope 150Nd and chemically purified. A total of 46.64 g of Nd2O3 powder mixed with a concentration of 8% PVA glue was uniformly distributed between two layers of mylar to produce a composite foil with a total mass of 56.68 g. The foil was 2484 mm long and 65 mm wide. The total mass of the isotope 150Nd in the foil was 36.6\u00b10.2 g [13]. The 150Nd composite foil was located in Sector 5 of the NEMO-3 detector between a foil of 100Mo and a foil containing 96Zr and 48Ca.\nA more detailed description of the NEMO-3 detector, its calibration and performance can be found in [13,14]."

According to the decay scheme in Fig. 1, two electrons from the \u03b2\u03b2-decay are accompanied by one \u03b3 in the case of the transition to the 2+1 excited state and by two photons in the transition to the 0+1 excited state. We therefore select for this analysis twoelectron one-\u03b3 (ee\u03b3 ) and two-electron two-\u03b3 (ee\u03b3 \u03b3 ) event topologies. After the event selection, the \u03b2\u03b2-decay signal is identified by an excess in the data over the expected background.\nBoth a measurement of the two-neutrino \u03b2\u03b2-decay and a search for the neutrinoless \u03b2\u03b2-decay to the 0+1 excited state are carried out in the ee\u03b3 \u03b3 and ee\u03b3 channels. The \u03b2\u03b2-decays to the 2+1 excited state are explored in the ee\u03b3 channel.\nA multivariate analysis improves the separation of the signal from the background. To this end the Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) method is used. The analysis employs a BDT algorithm with adaptive boosting, part of the ROOT [15] TMVA package [16].\nWhere no evidence of a signal in the data is found, a limit on the corresponding decay half-life is set. The 90% C.L. limit is calculated using the CLs method employing the modified frequentist approach [17\u201319].\n3.1 Event selection\nIn this analysis, the ee\u03b3 \u03b3 and ee\u03b3 event topologies are used. Events are selected by requiring two reconstructed electron tracks coming from the source foil, with each depositing in a separate scintillator block an energy greater than 150 keV. Extrapolating each track to the source foil gives the posi-\ntion of its decay vertex, and extrapolating to the calorimeter associates the track with the scintillator block of an optical module for energy and time measurement. A scintillator hit associated with a track must be isolated, i.e. no hits should be found in neighboring scintillator blocks.\nEach of the two electron tracks must have a length greater than 50 cm and originate from a common vertex in the 150Nd source foil: the separation between the two individually reconstructed track vertices is required to be less than 4 cm in the horizontal plane and less than 8 cm in the vertical direction. An event is excluded if its vertex is found in one of the regions of the enhanced activity in the foil corresponding to the localized contamination from 234mPa and 207Bi (hot spots). The locations of the hot spots, which amount to 7% of the 150Nd foil area, were determined in [12].\nTo ensure that an event corresponded to the simultaneous emission of two electrons from a common vertex, the corresponding time-of-flight (TOF) probability is required to be higher than 5%. The TOF probability is calculated using energy and time measurements from the calorimeter and the distances travelled by particles in the event; see [13,14] for details.\nA \u03b3 -ray is identified as either a single calorimeter hit or a cluster of neighbouring hits that are not associated with any track. A minimum threshold of 100 keV for the energy deposited in each of these calorimeter blocks is required. It is also required that no prompt Geiger hits are detected within 20 cm of any scintillator block attributed to a \u03b3 -ray. Events are rejected if the TOF probability exceeds 1% for the hypothesis that the event originates from an external \u03b3 - ray. The probability for the hypothesis that the photon(s) originated from the event vertex simultaneously with two electrons is required to be higher than 5%.\nAn event is rejected if it contains a recognized delayed alpha-particle track, as described in [14], to reduce the background from 214Bi decays.\nAs shown in Table 1, a total of 142 ee\u03b3 \u03b3 and 571 ee\u03b3 events are selected from the full data set.\n3.2 Background model\nThe main source of background events is trace amounts of naturally occurring radioactive isotopes that come from the 238U and 232Th radioactive series. The most important of them are (\u03b2, \u03b3 )-emitting isotopes with high Q\u03b2 values, such as 208Tl (Q\u03b2 = 4.99 MeV) and 214Bi (Q\u03b2 = 3.27 MeV). According to their origin with respect to the source foil, the background events are classified as internal or external ones.\nThe largest background contribution comes from the internal contamination of the source foil. The decay of a \u03b2emitting isotope inside the foil can mimic the \u03b2\u03b2-decay signal through several different mechanisms, such as a single \u03b2decay combined with M\u00f8ller scattering or a single \u03b2-decay\nto an excited state of the daughter nucleus followed by the emission of a conversion electron or a \u03b3 -ray that undergoes Compton scattering in the foil. From these mechanisms, additional \u03b3 -rays could be produced by bremsstrahlung or from a decay to an excited state. In addition to the radioactive impurities, a decay in a neighbouring NEMO-3 source foil can be misinterpreted to have its vertex in the 150Nd foil. The 150Nd \u03b2\u03b2-decay to the ground state also contributes to the background for the excited-state measurement; two electrons are produced in the decay, and one or two \u03b3 -rays could be emitted via bremsstrahlung.\nThe external background is there due to the radioactivity outside of the source foil. Radioactive decays within the detector components (mainly PMT glass), the shielding and rock, surrounding the laboratory, generate the external \u03b3 - ray flux. \u03b3 -ray interactions with the source foil can cause electron-positron pair production, a Compton interaction followed by M\u00f8ller scattering, or double Compton scattering. In the case of electron-positron pair production, two photons can be produced through annihilation of the positron.\nA subset of the external background is induced by radon. Radon is a highly diffusive gas and is outgassed into the air from the rock walls of the LSM laboratory. It is present in the tracker volume due to diffusion from laboratory air through detector seals and emanation from detector materials. The decay of radon progenies (mainly 214Bi) near the source foil can produce signal-like events similar to internal background decays.\nDetails of the background model and measured values of activities that are used in this analysis are provided in [12]. The DECAY0 event generator [20] is used to simulate the signal and backgrounds, and particles are tracked through a detailed GEANT3-based detector simulation [21]. Both the data and Monte Carlo (MC) events are processed by the same\nFig. 3 Distributions of the measured quantities for the ee\u03b3 \u03b3 events from the 150Nd foil after the preliminary event selection: energy sum of two electrons E2e, minimal electron energy Emine , minimal \u03b3 energy Emin\u03b3 , maximal electron energy E max e , maximal \u03b3 energy E max \u03b3 , total measured energy ETOT, cosine of the angle between two electrons\ncos(ee), between two photons cos(\u03b3 \u03b3 ), and between electron and \u03b3 cos(e\u03b3 ) for all e\u03b3 combinations. Data are compared to the MC prediction with the resulting number of 0+1 signal events obtained by background subtraction\nreconstruction and selection algorithm. The number of the expected background events with the ee\u03b3 \u03b3 and ee\u03b3 topologies is given in Table 1.\n3.3 Measurement of 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay to 0+1 excited state\nAn excess in the data over the total expected background is observed both in the ee\u03b3 \u03b3 and ee\u03b3 channels (see Table 1) and can be attributed to the signal of the \u03b2\u03b2-decay to the excited states of the daughter nucleus 150Sm."

The number of the 0+1 signal events S = N \u2212 B = 56.6 \u00b1 11.9 is obtained by subtracting the expected background from the number of events observed. This corresponds to the signal-tobackground ratio\nS/B = 0.66 and to the statistical signal significance N\u03c3 = S/\u221aS + B = 4.8. The 0+1 signal efficiency is = 0.87%. This corresponds to the following half-life estimation:\nT 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b21/2 (0 + 1 ) = [ 8.18+2.18\u22121.42(stat) ] \u00d7 1019 year. (4)\nIn order to suppress the background and maximize the signal significance, the event classification employed the BDT method. Using MC of the 0+1 signal and the background, the BDT training is performed on the set of observables shown in Fig. 3, with the total measured energy ETOT and the maximal \u03b3 energy Emax\u03b3 being the most important variables. After training, both the data and MC were processed by the BDT algorithm which assigned a BDT score to each event to aid discrimination of the signal from the background. The BDT score is a continuous variable with lower values for more background-like events and higher values for more signallike events. The resulting BDT score distribution for the signal of the 150Nd 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay to the 0+1 excited state in the ee\u03b3 \u03b3 channel is presented in Fig. 4. The vertical dashed line in this figure denotes the optimal cut on the BDT score to maximize the signal significance.\nAfter rejecting the events with lower BDT score values, we are left with 53 data events and a total expected background of 13.9 events, see Table 2. This requirement suppresses the background by a factor of 6.1 and reduces the signal efficiency by a factor of 0.88 to = 0.76%. After background subtraction, 39.1 events attributed to the signal remain. This provides the signal-to-background ratio S/B = 2.8 and the signal statistical significance N\u03c3 = S/\u221aS + B = 5.4. The corresponding half-life is estimated to be\nT 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b21/2 (0 + 1 ) = [ 1.04+0.24\u22120.16 (stat) +0.12 \u22120.11 (syst) ] \u00d71020 year. (5)\nThis half-life value statistically agrees within 1\u03c3 with the result in Eq. (4) obtained after preliminary event selection, but is more precise.\nThe distributions of the measured kinematic variables after the cut on the BDT score are shown in Fig. 5. The data show good agreement with MC for the measured quan-\ntities. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov probability values obtained for them are in the range from 10% to 98%. In particular, this probability is equal to 29% for the cos(\u03b3 \u03b3 ) distribution representing the \u03b3 \u03b3 angular correlation. This correlation is measured for this decay for the first time and is found to agree well with 1 \u2212 3cos2\u03b8 + 4cos4\u03b8 behaviour characterizing the 0+ \u2192 2+ \u2192 0+ cascade [22]."

The effect of systematic uncertainty on background rates also becomes more significant with larger backgrounds.

It is estimated by measuring the calibrated 232U source activities. These activities, measured by the NEMO-3 detector for ee\u03b3 \u03b3 and ee\u03b3 events, are found to be in agreement with true values within 7.8%. This value, taken into\naccount both for signal and background events, leads to the decay rate uncertainty of (+11.5, \u22129.8)% in the ee\u03b3 \u03b3 and (+18.4, \u221215.7)% in the ee\u03b3 channel.\nThe systematic uncertainty on the number of background events (see Tables 1, 2) was calculated from those of the individual background components\u2019 activities estimated in [12].

(8)\nThe systematic uncertainty of the mean value was obtained by calculating the mean of the two measurements coherently increased/decreased by their individual systematic uncertainties. The mean value corresponds to the signal-to-background ratio S/B = 1.3 and the statistical signal significance N\u03c3stat = 6.8. Using the total error determined by summing the statistical and systematic errors in quadrature, we obtain the 0+1 signal significance N\u03c3tot = 5. This half-life value is compared with the results of the previous measurements in Table 4. There is a good overall agreement between the results. The value obtained in this work is most precise.\nThis half-life value may be used to extract the experimental value of the corresponding NME according to Eq. (1). Using the phase space factor value G = 4.116 \u00d7 10\u221218 year\u22121 [24] and gA = 1.2756 [1], one obtains the NME value (scaled by the electron rest mass) for the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 transition to the 0+1 excited state:\n|M2\u03bd(0+1 )| = 0.0288+0.0032\u22120.0028. (9)\nOne can compare this value with the NME value for the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 transition to the ground state of 150Sm:\n|M2\u03bd(0+g.s.)| = 0.0338+0.0013\u22120.0011, (10)\nobtained using the half-life of Eq. 3 from [9] and G = 3.540 \u00d7 10\u221217year\u22121 from [24]). The relative difference between these two NMEs is (15+10\u22129 )%. One can see that the values of these matrix elements are very close (in the first approximation they are the same) and that M2\u03bd(0+g.s.) is \u223c15% greater than M2\u03bd(0+1 ). This is consistent with the conclusions in [8,25]. The same conclusions were drawn for 100Mo (see, for example, [25]). Thus, it looks like a certain regularity. It seems important and interesting to understand this regularity and to give it some theoretical explanation. Finally, this can help to clarify the situation with the calculations of nuclear matrix elements.\n3.4 Search for 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay to 2+1 excited state\nAs stated above, there is no excess in the data above the expected background that could be attributed to the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay to the 2+1 excited state. A limit on this transition was set using the ee\u03b3 events. A BDT classification was performed for the 2+1 signal against backgrounds, including all the contributions listed in Table 1 plus the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay to the 0+1 excited state normalized according to Eq. (8).\nThe BDT score distribution in Fig. 9 was used for calculating the limit. Hereafter, the systematic uncertainties discussed above are taken into account. Systematic uncertainties are treated as uncertainties on the expected numbers of events and are folded into the signal and background expectations via the Gaussian distribution. The systematic uncertainties considered for each of the background component normalizations are given in Table 1. The uncertainty on the normalization of the 150Nd 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay to the 0+1 excited state is constrained by the statistical uncertainty of the measurement given in Eq. (8). The obtained result\nT 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b21/2 (2 + 1 ) > 2.42 \u00d7 1020 year at 90% C.L. (11)\nis slightly more restrictive than the limit set in [9].\n3.5 Search for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay to 0+1 excited state\nThe ee\u03b3 \u03b3 and ee\u03b3 events were used to search for the signal of the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay to the 0+1 excited state. No significant data excess is observed for the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 signal in the distribution of the summed kinetic energy of two electrons (see Fig. 10). There are 4.2 (16.1) events expected in the region from 2 MeV to 2.8 MeV under the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 peak, and 3 (16) data events are observed in the ee\u03b3 \u03b3 (ee\u03b3 ) channel. The BDT score distribution is shown in Fig. 11.\nIn the ee\u03b3 \u03b3 channel, the observed half-life limit is\nT 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b21/2 (0 + 1 ) > 5.20 \u00d7 1021 year at 90% C.L. , (12)\nand in the ee\u03b3 channel it is\nT 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b21/2 (0 + 1 ) > 9.97 \u00d7 1021 year at 90% C.L. (13)\nWhen the combination of the two channels is used for calculating the limit, the result is\nT 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b21/2 (0 + 1 ) > 13.6 \u00d7 1021 year at 90% C.L. (14)\nThis limit is much stronger than that from [23].\n3.6 Search for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay to 2+1 excited state\nThe search for the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay to the 2+1 excited state was performed using the ee\u03b3 events. The distribution of the summed kinetic energy of two electrons for these events is shown in\nFig. 12. The 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 signal in this distribution would be manifested in a peak located in the energy interval from 2.4 to 3.2 MeV. There are 12 data events in this interval in good agreement with the MC expectation of 11.6 events, meaning that no evidence of the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay is observed. The BDT score distribution for this decay mode is presented in Fig. 13. With this distribution, we obtain the following half-life limit:\nT 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b21/2 (2 + 1 ) > 1.26 \u00d7 1022 year at 90% C.L.
