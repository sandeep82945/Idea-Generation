1. Investigate the role of α4β7 integrin in the pathogenesis of PPP. This could be done by studying the expression of α4β7 integrin on lymphocytes and endothelial cells in PPP lesions, and by examining the effects of vedolizumab on the migration of lymphocytes in vitro.


2. Evaluate the efficacy of vedolizumab in a larger cohort of patients with PPP. This would help to confirm the findings of the present case report and to determine the optimal dosage and duration of vedolizumab treatment for PPP.


3. Explore the use of vedolizumab in combination with other treatments for PPP. This could include topical therapies, oral medications, and phototherapy. The goal would be to develop a more effective and well-tolerated treatment regimen for PPP.


4. Investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of vedolizumab in patients with PPP. This would involve monitoring patients for adverse events and assessing the durability of the response to vedolizumab over time.


5. Study the effects of vedolizumab on the intestinal environment in patients with PPP. This could be done by examining the composition of the gut microbiota and by measuring the levels of inflammatory markers in the stool. The goal would be to determine whether vedolizumab improves PPP symptoms by modulating the intestinal environment.
