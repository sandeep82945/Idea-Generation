    "abstractText": "Technological advancements in X-ray imaging using bright and coherent synchrotron sources now allows the decoupling of sample size and resolution while maintaining high sensitivity to the microstructures of soft, partially dehydrated tissues. The continuous developments in multiscale X-ray imaging resulted in hierarchical phase-contrast tomography, a comprehensive approach to address the challenge of organ-scale (up to tens of centimeters) soft tissue imaging with resolution and sensitivity down to the cellular level. Using this technique, we imaged ex vivo an entire human left lung at an isotropic voxel size of 25.08 \u03bcm along with local zooms down to 6.05\u20136.5 \u03bcm and 2.45\u20132.5 \u03bcm in voxel size. The high tissue contrast offered by the fourth-generation synchrotron source at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility reveals the complex multiscale anatomical constitution of the human lung from the macroscopic (centimeter) down to the microscopic (micrometer) scale. the dataset provides comprehensive organ-scale 3D information of the secondary pulmonary lobules and delineates the microstructure of lung nodules with unprecedented detail.",

The continuous developments in multiscale X-ray imaging resulted in hierarchical phase-contrast tomography, a comprehensive approach to address the challenge of organ-scale (up to tens of centimeters) soft tissue imaging with resolution and sensitivity down to the cellular level. Using this technique, we imaged ex vivo an entire human left lung at an isotropic voxel size of 25.08 \u03bcm along with local zooms down to 6.05\u20136.5 \u03bcm and 2.45\u20132.5 \u03bcm in voxel size. The high tissue contrast offered by the fourth-generation synchrotron source at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility reveals the complex multiscale anatomical constitution of the human lung from the macroscopic (centimeter) down to the microscopic (micrometer) scale. the dataset provides comprehensive organ-scale 3D information of the secondary pulmonary lobules and delineates the microstructure of lung nodules with unprecedented detail."

Traditionally, studies of lung microanatomy at the organ scale require lengthy operations in targeted sampling, tissue preparation, histological staining, and sectioning1,2. Nowadays, ex vivo clinical evaluations of whole lung microstructures are carried out without sectioning using absorption-contrast micro-CT at around 100 \u03bcm voxel size. A limited area of the lung may then be selected for imaging at higher resolution using histology3\u20135. X-ray phase-contrast imaging6,7 provides higher sensitivity and contrast than laboratory micro-CT8. Compared with optical virtual histology9, X-ray phase contrast from free-space propagation requires no imaging optics and, at the same time, removes the need for laborious tissue clearing and fluorescent labeling that are essential for optical imaging10. The compatibility of X-ray phase-contrast imaging with existing X-ray sources will facilitate its gradual adoption and transition from preclinical research to clinical diagnostics6,11,12. At synchrotron facilities, systematic upgrades13,14 in the X-ray source and imaging techniques over the past decades provide the means to tackle biological questions across meaningful scales and resolution11,15\u201320.

The technique integrates a multiscale imaging workflow4,27\u201330 into a single setup, utilizing propagation phase contrast obtained from high-energy, polychromatic X-rays and tunable detection settings. Therefore, scanning an entire human organ (with a size of 5\u201330 cm in each dimension) at multiple resolutions can be executed without dissecting the sample or requiring to transport to different instrument locations or facilities27,28,30. HiP-CT features a customized flat-field correction, an attenuation scanning protocol, along with an efficient tomographic sampling and stitching pipeline to cover large, soft-tissue organs entirely, without staining27,31 or clearing10. The integrated single-modality, multiscale imaging approach of HiP-CT26 ensures a simplified image registration procedure thanks to the consistent tissue contrast across lengthscales. Its imaging protocol takes inspiration from existing multiscale approaches4,18,19,29, starting with a two-step tomographic sampling of the whole organ (full-field tomography), followed by progressive zoom-ins to selected features of the microanatomy through local tomographies at various finer resolutions compatible with the relevant anatomical context. HiP-CT requires the sample such as a soft-tissue organ to be embedded in 70% ethanol solution in water and immobilized with agar blocks throughout imaging (see Fig.\u00a01a,b). The flat-field correction takes reference from a separate container (reference jar) of the same size as the sample jar to enhance the soft tissue contrast (see Fig.\u00a01c). We provide here the dataset of an intact human left lung imaged by HiP-CT at 25.08 \u03bcm voxel size (full organ, see Fig.\u00a01d) and at 6.05\u20136.5 \u03bcm and 2.45\u20132.5 \u03bcm voxel sizes for various local volumes of interest (VOIs) accomplished by optimization of the incident X-ray spectrum, propagation distance, scintillator thickness, and the coupling optics before the detector (see Methods). The X-ray imaging experiments were carried out at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) BM05 beamline using the recently upgraded fourth-generation extremely brilliant X-ray source (ESRF-EBS)32,33."

The entire left lung (see Fig.\u00a01a) was harvested from a body donor, a 94-year-old woman who succumbed to natural causes, with the medical record provided in Table\u00a01. Body donation was based on free consent by the donor antemortem. The relevant postmortem medical procedures were carried out at Laboratoire d\u2019Anatomie des Alpes Fran\u00e7aises (LADAF) according to the Quality Appraisal for Cadaveric Studies scale recommendations34. All dissections respected the memory of the deceased. The protocols for transport and imaging were approved by the French legislation for body donation. The body of the deceased donor was embalmed and the lung preparations were carried out at ~36 hours postmortem. The lung was instilled through the trachea with a 4% formalin solution using 30 cm of water column positive pressure. The trachea was then ligatured to maintain the inflated configuration in order to fix the lungs in a non-collapsed state. The body was then kept at 4 \u00b0C for 3 days before the dissection. Once removed, the lungs were immersed in 4% formalin solution for 3 more days. Afterwards, it was successively immersed in ethanol solutions (odorless bioethanol, Cheminol, France) with increasing concentration up to 70% (volume fraction). The lung was kept inflated during ethanol dehydration by repeatedly pushing the solution through its main bronchus with a syringe. The significantly lower density of ethanol (789 kg/m3) compared with water (1000 kg/m3) provides a high base contrast\u00a0for soft tissues35,36.\nWe used a PET (polyethylene terephthalate) jar of comparable size to the lung for X-ray imaging due to its commercial availability (3600 mL Sweep Jars with Cap, Medline Scientific, UK), high radiation tolerance37 and optical transparency in assisting sample alignment and assessment of sample condition during imaging. To secure the lung tightly in place and prevent it from touching the container edges on all sides, we prepared agar (Agar-Agar powder, from wild red seaweed, Nat-Ali, France) blocks in ~1 cm3-sized cubes and stacked them at the bottom of the jar and around the organ to firmly embed the lung. The procedure for the agar preparation has been thoroughly described preivously26. The gaps between the small agar blocks provide the escape routes for residual gas removal. The sample mounting procedure involves alternated filling of the agar-ethanol mixture and gentle vacuum degassing to minimize the existing microbubbles from dissolved air in the solution environment and within the organ, thereby eliminating their interference with imaging. The degassing procedure used a membrane pump to directly pump38 above the PET sample jar with the lid open in a sealed vacuum glass dryer. Prior to imaging, the PET jar containing the lung, ethanol solution, and agar embedding was placed in a custom-made sample holder to connect to the rotation stage at the synchrotron beamline26.\nSynchrotron X-ray imaging and reconstruction. The implementation and capabilities of HiP-CT have been described in detail in a separate publication26. Here, we describe the settings used for lung imaging. All X-ray imaging experiments were carried out at the ESRF bending magnet beamline BM0539. The polychromatic synchrotron beam produced at the beamline was passed through a set of filters and then directly used for imaging without additional X-ray optics. The voxel size is effectively controlled by the adjustable visible-light imaging optics situated after the LuAG:Ce (cerium-doped lutetium aluminium garnet) X-ray scintillator (custom-made by Crytur, Czechia) and before the sCMOS (scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) light sensor (PCO edge 4.2 CLHS, PCO Imaging, Germany). Specifically, the imaging optics include the dzoom (\u201cdemagnifying zoom\u201d) and zoom lenses, which cover the ranges of 6.5\u201325.5 \u03bcm and 1.3\u20136.3 \u03bcm, respectively. Because the synchrotron beam size (with usable area 50 mm \u00d7 4 mm at BM05) is considerably smaller than the size of the human left lung (container size 260 mm height, up to 140 mm width at the widest), imaging the entire left lung at 25.08 \u03bcm voxel size required stitching together multiple subscans. We used the half-acquisition (or half-object\n3Scientific Data | (2022) 9:264 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01353-y\nacquisition)40 method developed at ESRF for imaging the VOIs at 6.5 \u03bcm and 2.5 \u03bcm in voxel size.

Ring artifacts from the detectors are corrected in two steps: (1) Before reconstruction, the mean of the projections is subtracted from the projections to remove the rings with constant intensity rings; (2) After reconstruction, the residual inhomogeneous intensity rings were removed using the polar transform combined with linear motion blurring filter41. Tomographic reconstruction employs the phase and amplitude estimates obtained from Paganin\u2019s method42, followed by a 2D unsharp mask of the retrieved phase maps as input for the filtered backprojection algorithm.

We summarize below the imaging and reconstruction protocols for the human lung at each imaged resolution including the key parameters.\n\u2022 Full-field tomography (the\u00a0whole organ at 25.08 \u03bcm voxel size, see Fig.\u00a02a,c): The detected X-ray energy averaged at ~93 keV after filters and sample, the propagation distance was 3475 mm, the scintillator thickness was 2 mm. In total, two sets of 9990 projections were measured by the quarter-acquisition method26 with an offset of 800 pixels for the half-acquisition. A step size of 2.2 mm in the vertical (z) direction was used to cover the height of the sample jar with a total of 98 quarter-acquisition subscans. Radiographic stitching was first carried out to recover a half-acquisition scan40 before the reconstruction. \u2022 Local tomography of level 1 VOI (6.5 \u03bcm and 6.05 \u03bcm voxel size, see Fig.\u00a02b,c): The detected X-ray energy averaged at ~88 keV (~89 keV) after filters and sample, the propagation distance was 3500 mm (3475 mm), the scintillator thickness was 1 mm (2 mm) for the VOIs with 6.5 \u03bcm (6.05 \u03bcm) voxel size. In total, 6000 projections were measured by the half-acquisition method with an offset of 900 pixels. A step size of 2.2 mm in the vertical direction was used to cover the height of the VOIs. \u2022 Local tomography of level 2 VOI (2.5 \u03bcm and 2.45 \u03bcm voxel size, see Fig.\u00a02b,c): The detected X-ray energy averaged at ~77 keV (~79 keV) after filters and sample, the propagation distance was 1440 mm (1500 mm), the scintillator thickness was 0.25 mm (0.2 mm) for the VOIs with 2.5 \u03bcm (2.45 \u03bcm) voxel size. In total, 6000 projections were measured by the half-acquisition method with an offset of 900 pixels. A step size of 1.5 mm in the vertical direction was used to cover the height of the VOIs.\nVolume selection and anatomical reference. Besides the full-field tomography of the entire lung, subsequent smaller VOIs were selected with representative features and imaged with local tomography at higher resolution, including 6.5 \u03bcm (5 locations) and 6.05 \u03bcm (3 locations) for level 1 and 2.5 \u03bcm (5 locations) and 2.45 \u03bcm (3 locations) for level 2 VOIs, respectively. All VOIs have a cylindrical field of view around the rotation axis after removing the boundary artifacts from the local tomographic reconstruction. To obtain the displacements and rotations, the VOIs are spatially registered to the whole lung data by hand in VGStudio Max (version 3.4) and the procedure to apply them is described in Usage Notes. The sizes of the VOIs, their displacements, and rotations with respect to the center of the whole lung data are listed in Table\u00a02 and illustrated in Fig.\u00a03a\u2013d. In addition, we provide brief anatomical references to the VOI spatial locations in Table\u00a02 with respect to the whole lung data at 25.08 \u03bcm. To retain traceable data provenance, we keep the same alphanumeric labels of the VOIs as used in the original experiments. Figure\u00a03e visualizes two selected VOIs in the lower lobe of the lung."

The metadata information in Table\u00a02 is also provided in the corresponding text file contained in each data deposit. The landing page associated with each DOI contains extended information on the parameters of the X-ray beamline for phase-contrast tomography, experimental scanning protocol, and data processing procedures.\nTechnical Validation Although the radiation dose in HiP-CT scans is well below the tissue damage threshold26, due to radiation-induced bubble formation, which only appeared after multiple high-resolution, local tomography scans, the sample went through re-degassing before the remaining measurements were made. The bubbles largely come from solvent vaporization61 but don\u2019t cause visible radiation damage as shown by histology26. However, a consequence of re-degassing is that not all of the VOIs have been imaged consecutively during the same beamtime. In the course of re-degassing, the sample was kept in the container to maintain its original position. The sample jar was then placed into the synchrotron X-ray beamline for further imaging. During the process, care was exercised such that the VOIs scanned before and after re-degassing can be registered to the whole volume without large deformation.\nIn the imaged volumes, contrast is produced by the local density differences between the lung tissue constituents and the void spaces of the airways, alveoli, and\u00a0blood vessels filled with ethanol solution (see Fig.\u00a03e,f). Within the whole lung data at a voxel size of 25.08 \u03bcm, the interlobular septa, the boundaries of the secondary pulmonary lobules62,63 and the perilobular vasculature, are clearly visible (see Fig.\u00a03f). At high spatial resolution, the local density difference increasingly becomes the dominant contributor to image contrast in VOIs26. The consistent contrast across lengthscales provides detailed information for the study of lung morphology for the healthy individual or as a\u00a0control.\nFolder name (.zip) Binning Image size Voxel size (\u00b5m3) 25.08um_LADAF_2020-27_lung-left_pag-0.11_0.25_jp2_ 1 5984 \u00d7 5984 \u00d7 8720 25.083\n50.16um_LADAF_2020-27_lung-left_pag-0.11_0.25_jp2_ 2 2992 \u00d7 2992 \u00d7 4360 50.163\n100.32um_LADAF_2020-27_lung-left_pag-0.11_0.25_jp2_ 4 1496 \u00d7 1496 \u00d7 2180 100.323\n6.5um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-01_pag-0.07_0.43_jp2_ 1 3856 \u00d7 3856 \u00d7 7506 6.53\n13um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-01_pag-0.07_0.43_jp2_ 2 1928 \u00d7 1928 \u00d7 3753 13.03\n6.5um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-02b_pag-0.12_0.45_jp2_ 1 3854 \u00d7 3854 \u00d7 4114 6.53\n13um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-02b_pag-0.12_0.45_jp2_ 2 1928 \u00d7 1928 \u00d7 3753 13.03\n6.5um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-03b_pag-0.12_0.46_jp2_ 1 3852 \u00d7 3852 \u00d7 1402 6.53\n13um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-03b_pag-0.12_0.46_jp2_ 2 1926 \u00d7 1926 \u00d7 701 13.03\n6.5um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-04b_pag-0.12_0.46_jp2_ 1 3856 \u00d7 3856 \u00d7 16318 6.53\n13um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-04b_pag-0.12_0.46_jp2_ 2 1928 \u00d7 1928 \u00d7 8159 13.03\n6.5um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-05_pag-0.08_0.43_jp2_ 1 3852 \u00d7 3852 \u00d7 9202 6.53\n13um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-05_pag-0.08_0.43_jp2_ 2 1926 \u00d7 1926 \u00d7 4601 13.03\n6.05um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-01_pag-0.01_0.03_jp2_ 1 3822 \u00d7 3822 \u00d7 1258 6.053\n12.1um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-01_pag-0.01_0.03_jp2_ 2 1911 \u00d7 1911 \u00d7 629 12.13\n6.05um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-02_pag-0.01_0.19_jp2_ 1 3818 \u00d7 3818 \u00d7 6970 6.053\n12.1um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-02_pag-0.01_0.19_jp2_ 2 1909 \u00d7 1909 \u00d7 3485 12.13\n6.05um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-06_pag-0.02_0.25_jp2_ 1 3816 \u00d7 3816 \u00d7 8074 6.053\n12.1um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-06_pag-0.02_0.25_jp2_ 2 1908 \u00d7 1908 \u00d7 4037 12.13\n2.5um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_ROI-01_pag-0.02_0.25_jp2_ 1 3878 \u00d7 3878 \u00d7 12802 2.53\n5um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_ROI-01_pag-0.02_0.25_jp2_ 2 1939 \u00d7 1939 \u00d7 6401 5.03\n2.5um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-02b_pag-0.04_0.34_jp2_ 1 3880 \u00d7 3880 \u00d7 5600 2.53\n5um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-02b_pag-0.04_0.34_jp2_ 2 1940 \u00d7 1940 \u00d7 2800 5.03\n2.5um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-03_pag-0.02_0.04_jp2_ 1 3878 \u00d7 3878 \u00d7 5600 2.53\n5um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-03_pag-0.02_0.04_jp2_ 2 1939 \u00d7 1939 \u00d7 2800 5.03\n2.5um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-04_pag-0.02_0.29_jp2_ 1 3876 \u00d7 3876 \u00d7 5600 2.53\n5um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-04_pag-0.02_0.29_jp2_ 2 1938 \u00d7 1938 \u00d7 2800 5.03\n2.5um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-05_pag-0.02_0.24_jp2_ 1 3868 \u00d7 3868 \u00d7 15300 2.53\n5um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_VOI-05_pag-0.02_0.24_jp2_ 2 1934 \u00d7 1934 \u00d7 7650 5.03\n2.45um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_01_pag-0.03_0.05_jp2_ 1 3816 \u00d7 3816 \u00d7 3478 2.453\n4.9um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_01_pag-0.03_0.05_jp2_ 2 1908 \u00d7 1908 \u00d7 1739 4.93\n2.45um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_02_pag-0.02_0.06_jp2_ 1 3810 \u00d7 3810 \u00d7 4868 2.453\n4.9um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_02_pag-0.02_0.06_jp2_ 2 1905 \u00d7 1905 \u00d7 999 4.93\n2.45um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_06_pag-0.02_0.04_jp2_ 1 3810 \u00d7 3810 \u00d7 1998 2.453\n4.9um_LADAF-2020-27_lung-left_06_pag-0.02_0.04_jp2_ 2 1905 \u00d7 1905 \u00d7 999 4.93\nTable 3.

In addition, despite the great efforts in maintaining the integrity of the organ during preparation and scanning, in some subpleural areas of the lung, we have noticed a slight compression. We attribute the potential causes of these features to the following: (1) The formalin used in fixation may have difficulties in reaching the more peripheral lung areas. (2) The tight\u00a0fit of the agar blocks around the lung. (3) A sign of minimal parabronchial and/or subpleural emphysema due to aging5."
