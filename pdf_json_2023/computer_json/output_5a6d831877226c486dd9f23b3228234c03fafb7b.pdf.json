    "abstractText": "Background The genome of the largest known animal virus, the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) responsible for huge economic losses and loss of employment in aquaculture, suffers from inconsistent annotation nomenclature. Novel genome sequence, circular genome and variable genome length led to nomenclature inconsistencies. Since vast knowledge has already accumulated in the past two decades with inconsistent nomenclature, the insights gained on a genome could not be easily extendable to other genomes. Therefore, the present study aims to perform comparative genomics studies in WSSV on uniform nomenclature. Methods We have combined the standard mummer tool with custom scripts to develop missing regions finder (MRF) that documents the missing genome regions and coding sequences in virus genomes in comparison to a reference genome and in its annotation nomenclature. The procedure was implemented as web tool and in commandline interface. Using MRF, we have documented the missing coding sequences in WSSV and explored their role in virulence through application of phylogenomics, machine learning models and homologous genes. Results We have tabulated and depicted the missing genome regions, missing coding sequences and deletion hotspots in WSSV on a common annotation nomenclature and attempted to link them to virus virulence. It was observed that the ubiquitination, transcription regulation and nucleotide metabolism might be essentially required for WSSV pathogenesis; and the structural proteins, VP19, VP26 and VP28 are essential for virus assembly. Few minor structural proteins in WSSV would act as envelope glycoproteins. We have also demonstrated the advantage of MRF in providing detailed graphic/tabular output in less time and also in handling of low-complexity, repeat-rich and highly similar regions of the genomes using other virus cases. Conclusions Pathogenic virus research benefits from tools that could directly indicate the missing genomic regions and coding sequences between isolates/strains. In virus research, the analyses performed in this study provides an Karthic Krishnan and Vinaya Kumar Katneni contributed equally to this work and share first authorship *Correspondence: Vinaya Kumar Katneni Vinaya.Katneni@icar.gov.in Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Page 2 of 18 Krishnan et al.

To conclude, the approach implemented in MRF complements similarity-based tools in comparative genomics involving large, highly-similar, length-varying and/or inconsistently annotated viral genomes.",

The Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication waiver (http:// creat iveco mmons. org/ publi cdoma in/ zero/1. 0/) applies to the data made available in this article, unless otherwise stated in a credit line to the data.\nMethods We have combined the standard mummer tool with custom scripts to develop missing regions finder (MRF) that documents the missing genome regions and coding sequences in virus genomes in comparison to a reference genome and in its annotation nomenclature. The procedure was implemented as web tool and in commandline interface. Using MRF, we have documented the missing coding sequences in WSSV and explored their role in virulence through application of phylogenomics, machine learning models and homologous genes.\nResults We have tabulated and depicted the missing genome regions, missing coding sequences and deletion hotspots in WSSV on a common annotation nomenclature and attempted to link them to virus virulence. It was observed that the ubiquitination, transcription regulation and nucleotide metabolism might be essentially required for WSSV pathogenesis; and the structural proteins, VP19, VP26 and VP28 are essential for virus assembly. Few minor structural proteins in WSSV would act as envelope glycoproteins. We have also demonstrated the advantage of MRF in providing detailed graphic/tabular output in less time and also in handling of low-complexity, repeat-rich and highly similar regions of the genomes using other virus cases.\nConclusions Pathogenic virus research benefits from tools that could directly indicate the missing genomic regions and coding sequences between isolates/strains.

            "text": "The white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is the largest known animal virus with genome size ranging from 280 to 314\u00a0Kb and contains > 500 coding sequences. The broad host range for the virus is reviewed by Pradeep et\u00a0al. [1] which includes a commercially significant entity, the penaeid shrimp whose fishery and culture contributes to global nutritional security and employment. As per the latest FAO yearbook of fishery and aquaculture statistics [2], the global shrimp production for the year 2019 was 6.55 million tonnes with an estimated value of USD 40.67 billion. Since its first report in early nineties the WSSV has caused huge economic losses to shrimp farming to the tune of billions of USD [3\u20138] in addition to the loss of employment as WSSV can induce 100% cumulative mortality in as little as 3\u00a0days\u2019 time [9, 10].\nThe genomics studies with WSSV suffers from a peculiar problem of inconsistency in genome annotation nomenclature owing to its novel genome sequence, circular DNA as genetic material, variation in genome length between isolates and genome-wide deletions. Looking deeper, when the genome of WSSV was first deciphered in 2001 [11], its sequence did not show similarity to any other pathogen. Taxonomically, the issue was addressed by creating a new Genus, Whispovirus (Whi and spo taken from initial letters of White and Spot respectively) for WSSV under the Family, Nimaviridae, a new animal virus. The genome annotation was performed by annotating the coding sequences (CDS) serially with Arabic numerals and a common prefix like wsv001, wsv002,\n\u2026, wsv526 in the order in which they were arranged in the genome. In the genomes published subsequently, other prefixes like WSSV (AF440570), ORF (MF768985) etc. were also used which led to the existence of different nomenclature systems for genomes of various WSSV isolates.\nThe circular nature of WSSV genome added further complexity to the annotation nomenclature. First, when the circular genomes were published as linear sequence, they did not have uniform start position (Fig.\u00a01). Secondly, even if the sequence of isolates starts with same CDS and use the same prefix, the Arabic numeral for CDS changed from the very first instance of a deletion or insertion in one of the genomes. As the annotation nomenclature varied across the genomes, the results inferred on one WSSV genome could not be easily comparable to other genomes. This has remained a challenging area in comparative genomics studies of WSSV isolates. As mentioned in Wang et\u00a0al. [12], for CDS in WSSV genome, a uniform annotated name exists only for 48 structural proteins and 41 non-structural proteins. Even for some of these proteins there are aliases like, VP13B for VP16, VP160A for VP190, VP36B for VP33, VP60A for VP56 etc. For example, a single CDS is annotated with different names like wsv162 in AF332093, WSSV218 in AF440570, hypothetical protein in KT995472, KT995470 and KU216744, wsv161 in KY827813, ORF90 in AF369029 and ORF215 in MF768985. Such a complex annotation situation warrants comparison of genomes on the basis of only genome sequences rather than on CDS\nnomenclature. We strongly believe that inconsistent annotation nomenclature between isolates acted as a hindrance to knowledge dissemination and better understanding of the virus. Therefore, the present study aims to overcome the complexities existing in current nomenclature while comparing different genomes of WSSV on uniform basis.\nAnother issue of concern is very high similarity (> 98%) between genome sequences of any two WSSV isolates (Additional file\u00a0 1). Despite high similarity, WSSV genomes exhibit considerable variation in genome length, from 280,591\u00a0bp (MG702567; [13]) to 309,286\u00a0bp (KT995472; [14]). Therefore, in WSSV case, the tools capable of identifying the missing genomic regions and missing CDS between genomes are of high value than similarity search tools as the CDS missing in some isolates might be crucial for a better understanding of the pathogen. However, we do not have tools that could quickly tabulate and depict missing CDS in one genome when compared to another. This has motivated us to develop a general utility tool that helps in comprehensive analysis of WSSV genomes in one annotation nomenclature and also tabulates/depicts missing CDS profile, while comparing highly-similar, length-varying and inconsistently annotated genomes.\nIn this context, we have developed a tool that relies upon sequence similarity but differs from the existing ones by accounting for missing genomic regions located between identical regions and uses the annotation table to tabulate CDS present in those missing genomic regions. The tool, missing regions finder (MRF) principally developed to overcome the inconsistent annotation nomenclature of WSSV genomes has also been tested with other DNA/RNA virus genomes and the results are presented. The results implied the potential utility of MRF in virus research involving comparative genomics studies."

First, the genome regions (GR) that have exact base matches between reference and query genomes are obtained with MUMmer (MUMmer, RRID:SCR_018171) run with mum option [15]. Using the three column\u2019s output from MUMmer, for each of\nthe matching GR, the end base positions of reference and query genomes are calculated as below:\nwhere i = 1, 2,3,\u2026, n (exact matching GR), rs and re are the nucleotide start and end positions of reference genome, qs and qe are the nucleotide start and end positions of query genome, M is the length of matching GR between reference and query.\nBased on the above coordinates, the missing GR or otherwise simply called as missing regions (MR) between two consecutive matching GR are calculated as follows,\nwhere G is the length of the sequence missing between two matching GR in the iterations i and i \u2212 1, Rs and Re are the nucleotide start and end positions of MR of reference.\nThe MR can be a negative or positive integer or single base pair mismatch. The negative values which result from overlapping matches are ignored along with single base pair mismatches, leaving only the positive values which are the true MR. Then MRF compares the base positions of the CDS in gff3 table with the MR and prints the missing CDS. Based on the positions they fall in, the output is arranged in two parts as completely and partially missing CDS. The partially missing CDS can be of three types depending on the deletions at the beginning, end or within the sequence (Additional file\u00a02)."

Therefore, phylogenomic analyses have been conducted among the WSSV isolates to establish possible correlation, if any existing, between pathogenicity and phylogenetic relations. As WSSV genome is circular, initially the sequence of all 13 genomes was oriented to start with VP28 gene. Then multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was performed using MAFFT v7.305b [18] following FFT-NS-2 algorithm which is a fast and progressive method. The consensus alignment was analyzed in RAxML version 8.2.9 [19] with GTRGAMMAI model and random seed value of 12,345, to build maximum likelihood (ML) tree where the confidence of tree nodes was obtained after running 1000 bootstrap replications. With the same model, the consensus MSA was also analyzed in MrBayes 3.2.6 [20] to generate Bayes tree. For Bayesian inference, two simultaneous but completely independent runs that start from different random trees were executed with 4 chains for 10 million generations. The trees were sampled every 100 generations and convergence statistics\nwere calculated every 1000 generations. First 25% of samples were discarded and hence not included for calculating summary statistics. The maximum standard deviation of split frequencies and potential scale reduction factor, PSRF were used to check the convergence of runs.\nRanking important CDS with\u00a0random forest machine learning model A random forest machine learning model was deployed to rank the missing coding sequences that are important for classification of WSSV isolates to different clusters obtained in the phylogenetic tree. Each of the CDS that is completely deleted in one or the other query isolates as compared to CN isolate were coded as a binary categorical variable (0 = CDS deleted; 1 = CDS present). These categorical variables made out of deletion pattern of CDS were selected as independent variables in this analysis. The independent variables displaying similar deletion patterns across all WSSV isolates were removed from analyses except for one variable, to avoid redundancy in the feature set. A categorical dependent variable with three levels is made based on the clustering patterns of WSSV isolates in phylogenetic tree (for example, 1 for isolates in cluster 1, 2 for isolates in cluster 2 etc.). Then random forest model was run in Python\u2019s scikit learn library v0.21.1 to rank the important independent variables."

The CN isolate which is taken as reference in this study is one of the earliest sequenced genomes and longer than most other complete genomes (except CN01 and Taiwan) thus gave an opportunity to understand how the newly sequenced genomes have changed during the course of time. We have analyzed all the isolates against CN isolate using on-line version of MRF and tabulated the missing genomic regions and missing CDS which gave few interesting observations as detailed below.\nCompared to CN isolate, the bases deleted in most other isolates are quite close to the absolute genome length difference between them (Additional file\u00a03). However, there are certain isolates which differ, for example, the MEX2008 isolate is only 11,936 bases shorter but lost about 13,183 bases compared to CN isolate. Similarly, the IN_AP4RU and CN-Pc isolates which are shorter by 24,528 and 4896 bases but show deletions of 26,713 and 6429 bases respectively when compared to CN isolate. Therefore, it may be inferred that the longer genome does not necessarily have all the bases of the shorter genomes. This is very much evident in the case of CN01 and Taiwan isolates which are 4167 and 2168 bases longer than the reference but still lack 970 and 772 bases that are present in the CN isolate.\nThe MRF tool helped us to document the completely (Additional file\u00a04) and partially (Additional file\u00a05) missing CDS in all the 12 WSSV isolates in comparison to CN isolate. Importantly, the missing CDS are reported and commented in this manuscript in the annotation nomenclature of only CN isolate. The CN isolate has 524 CDS, out of which 82 CDS are either completely or partially lost in at least one of the other WSSV isolates.

A blast search conducted for WSSV genes against the blast database of shrimp/human genes and Chinese mitten crab genome revealed the homologous genes (Fig.\u00a03, Additional file\u00a0 10). The sequence of a WSSV gene, wsv285, an unannotated protein showed homology in all the three species tested in the study. The human gene sequence showing homology to wsv285 is annotated as proline, glutamate and leucine rich protein 1 (PELP1).\nOut of 524 coding sequences of CN isolate, only 4 of them showed significant (1e\u221205) similarity to shrimp\ngenes. These four are wsv67 (thymidylate synthetase, 553\u00a0 bp), wsv91 (immediate early protein, 240\u00a0 bp), wsv172 (ribonucleotide reductase large subunit, 545\u00a0bp) and wsv285 (202\u00a0bp). All these genes except wsv91 also showed similarity to genes of the human genome. In addition, the wsv188, ribonucleotide reductase small subunit of WSSV also matches with similar gene of humans. The fragments of Chinese mitten crab genome showed similarity to wsv91, wsv188, wsv238 (VP52A) and few other unannotated genes of WSSV.\nTesting MRF with\u00a0African swine fever virus A single run of MRF in batch mode tabulated and depicted all the completely and partially deleted genes in query genomes compared to the reference genome (refer Additional file\u00a017: Fig. A4 at p. 81 in user manual). Therefore, we could notice that apart from the MGF360 and MGF530/505 genes, many isolates also showed complete deletion of certain MGF110 family of genes. The low virulent isolates, OURT88/3 and NHV shared an identical deletion profile for both complete and partially deleted genes. Both of them did not have genes, MGF360-10L to MGF360-14L and MGF530/505-1R to MGF530/505-2R. The MGF530/505-3R gene is only partially lost in these isolates. Another avirulent isolate, Ba71V also shared similar deletion profile as that of OURT88/3 and NHV isolates, except that it still retained MGF530/505-2R and MGF530/505-3R genes and the MGF360-14L gene is only partially lost. The MGF110-12L and MGF110-13L genes have been found to be completely deleted in OURT88/3, NHV, Ba71V and tengani isolates. However it has been reported that the presence or absence of MGF110 family\nof genes does not alter the state of virulence of the virus [32]. The results highlight the importance of MRF to quickly obtain information related to the genetic variability among African swine fever virus isolates that differ in pathogenicity."

The comparative genome studies published for WSSV genomes are not easily comprehensible as different annotation nomenclature was followed in each case and this warrants performing genome-level analyses in only\none nomenclature. As ICTV study group on Whispovirus considers WSSV-CN (AF332093) as exemplar isolate [12], we conducted comparative genomics analysis with WSSV genomes keeping WSSV-CN isolate as the reference and in its nomenclature system.\nThe morphology and sequence of different WSSV isolates are similar but huge variation exists in genome length. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) that indicates genome-wide similarity (Additional file\u00a01) is very high (> 98%) between any two isolates. Several reports indicated variable virulence of different WSSV isolates [17, 33, 34]. Therefore, the features present in additional genome regions in longer genomes or missing genome regions in shorter genomes are valuable and should be focused in comparative genomics studies. In this regard, the MRF fills a void in the field of comparative genomics, where there is a dearth of suitable tools to analyze and interpret the genomic data. MRF stands out from other tools in this domain as it does not focus on what is present in a genome with respect to a reference but instead focuses on what is absent. Such a tool has also the potential to address the nomenclature issue concerning WSSV genomes, as users can compare several genomes against a single reference genome. In such case, results interpreted in the annotation nomenclature of a single reference genome would be easily comprehensible."

Despite a length difference of about 25\u00a0Kb, the CN01 isolate does not have CDS of wsv486 (CN03 nomenclature) that is present in CN03 isolate. The study also documented 3 deletion hotspots in WSSV where a stretch of 3 CDS are completely lost in at least 3 isolates. Some of the previous reports have also documented similar major deletions in WSSV isolates [35, 36]. Few envelope proteins, VP41A, VP52A, VP35 and an immediate early protein are present in these hotspots. The deletion hotspot, wsv481/wsv499 which is a widely studied variable region is retained completely by CN, CN01 and Taiwan isolates when rest of other genomes has suffered major deletions. Sequence overlaps among certain CDS resulted in finding of partial deletion in longer coding sequence. For example, the partial deletion of wsv479 in several isolates could be due to the overlapping of wsv479 (279,829\u2013281,358) with wsv480 (280,337\u2013280,669) and wsv481 (281,196\u2013 281,390) which are completely deleted. So far there is no evidence associating the presence or absence of this\nsegment with the virulence of WSSV. As majority of recently sequenced genomes lack many proteins in this stretch, probably the virus might not require them for infection and propagation."

            "text": "One of the standard outputs tabulated by MRF tool is the CDS that did not exhibit any deletions. An interesting finding, we have observed with WSSV is the retention of certain CDS in all isolates that have possible or confirmed roles in virus pathogenesis. The structural proteins in WSSV are essential for maintaining the structure of virions. Of the major structural proteins, VP19, VP26 and VP28 have been retained in all isolates of WSSV without displaying even minor deletions whereas the envelope protein, VP24 is partially lost (47%) in CN04 isolate. Absence of VP24 in CN04 virions was hypothesized to be responsible for decreased peroral infectivity in Litopenaeus vannamei [37]. It is also postulated that VP24 may not be necessary for virus assembly or maintenance of viral structure as WSSV virions with normal morphology could be assembled without VP24 [37].\nThe per os infectivity factors (PIFs) are found to be essential for infectivity of insect midgut cells in case of baculoviruses. Four genes that are homologues to PIFs were previously identified in WSSV [38]. These are wsv35 (VP110), wsv115, wsv209 (VP187) and wsv306 (VP39A). All these four PIFs did not exhibit any deletion in all the WSSV isolates used in this study. Further, four of the WSSV proteins, wsv199, wsv222, wsv249 and wsv403 possess RING-H2 domain which is capable of functioning as E3 ubiquitin protein ligases [39] and help in virus pathogenesis. The coding sequences of these RING proteins whose ubiquitination activity has been proven in shrimp [40\u201343] did not exhibit deletion in any of the isolates. The VP9 (wsv230), a metal ion binding, nonstructural protein capable of regulating transcription in WSSV [44] is retained by all isolates. Five WSSV proteins linked to nucleotide metabolism, wsv67, wsv112, wsv172, wsv188 and wsv395 [11] are again retained in all the isolates. Therefore, we hypothesize that the ubiquitination, transcription regulation and nucleotide metabolism might be few functions that might be essentially required for WSSV pathogenesis.\nRecently, a few other nimaviral genome sequences have been deciphered from host genomic fragments which shared about 28 core genes when analyzed along with WSSV genome [45]. Of these 28 genes, 15 genes which are associated with virus gene expression, DNA replication and DNA packaging are retained in all WSSV isolates used in this study. Only exception is with wsv313 which showed partial deletion in only IN_AP4RU isolate.\nOther 13 genes are hypothetical proteins and not yet annotated. Several immediate-early (IE) genes that are expressed during early stages of WSSV infection play an important role in viral replication [46, 47]. These IE genes have been retained in all WSSV isolates considered in this study. Only exception is with wsv178 which is completely deleted in CN03, CN04 and AU isolates while showing partial deletions in many other isolates. Analyses of these structural proteins, PIFs, RING proteins, IE genes and other genes related to DNA replication and DNA packaging indicates that these are the major genes essential for virus and have been retained in all WSSV isolates used in the study though wide difference is noticed in genome length between isolates. The MRF tool helped in comprehensive analyses of WSSV isolates by quickly tabulating the missing CDS in all isolates in one annotation nomenclature.\nMarker sequences indicative of\u00a0WSSV virulence The phylogenomic analysis indicated the existence of three major clusters for WSSV isolates. The clusters did not have common geographical pattern or time of isolate collection. Interestingly, the clusters did indicate a correlation to the virulence of isolate. For three Chinese isolates, the virulence pattern is known [17], CN01 is high-virulent, CN02 is medium-virulent and CN03 is low-virulent. These 3 isolates with varying virulence are grouped into 3 different clusters. The virulence of other isolates in each cluster might be similar to that of virulence-known Chinese isolates. Only the challenge trials with biological specimens and isolates, could confirm this correlated observation. Earlier studies found that VP41B (wsv242) which functions as a transcriptional activator for PjCaspase [48], is an important effector caspase involved in apoptosis process against viral infection in shrimp [49]. This envelope protein is completely lost in IN_AP4RU and partially lost in EC-15098, CN03, CN04 and AU isolates. Incidentally CN03 is a low virulent isolate.\nAssuming that the three clusters in phylogenetic tree indicate virulence of WSSV, a survey of the missing CDS has been conducted using the output of MRF tool. The CDS that exhibited complete deletion in all isolates belonging to each of the hypothesized high-virulent (cluster 1), medium-virulent (cluster 2) and low-virulent (cluster 3) clusters have been identified through MRF tool in the annotation nomenclature of CN isolate (Additional file\u00a013). These 14 CDS and the top 3 ranked CDS identified as important features by random forest model, have been examined for possible clues to virulence. However, majority of these CDS are hypothetical proteins except wsv237 which codes for a structural protein, VP41A. Therefore, we believe that valuable functional\ninformation linked to degree of virulence is hidden in these hypothetical proteins which need to be explored.\nGenerally, animal viruses depend on envelope glycoproteins for cell attachment. But the major structural proteins of WSSV are not glycosylated [50]. Non-glycosylation of major structural proteins was also observed in case of ASFV where few minor structural proteins were found to be glycosylated [51]. Therefore, a search was performed for glycosylation sites in the 14 proteins that exhibited complete deletion in medium-virulent and low-virulent clusters compared to high-virulent cluster at NetOGlyc3.1 Server [52] and NetNGlyc1.0Server [53]. Four and nine of the WSSV proteins were predicted to contain N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation sites respectively (Additional file\u00a014). Of these, as given in Additional file\u00a0 15, six proteins were annotated with GO terms like viral nucleocapsid (wsv489, wsv493 and wsv494), envelope glycoprotein (wsv490) or integral component of membrane (wsv482 and wsv484). Therefore, these minor structural proteins comprising glycosylation sites might help in cell attachment in WSSV in the absence of major glycoproteins in WSSV envelope. Deletions of these minor glycoproteins in medium and low virulent isolates add more evidence on their role in WSSV pathogenesis."

Three of the major structural proteins of WSSV, the VP24, VP26 and VP28 were proposed to have evolved by gene duplication which later acquired different functions [54]. The analyses on homologous genes between WSSV and host species revealed other interesting facts in this direction. One class of genes that WSSV genome showed homology to other host and non-host species is wsv172 and wsv188, the ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs). In living organisms, the RNR gene helps in DNA synthesis by catalyzing the formation of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) from ribonucleotide triphosphates [55]. Of the four deoxyribonucleotides (dCMP, dGMP, dAMP and dTMP), only the formation of dTMP from dUMP requires an additional catalytic transfer of methyl group mediated by an enzyme, thymidylate synthetase [56]. The WSSV genome also has thymidylate synthetase, wsv67 which has showed similarity to shrimp and human thymidylate synthetase that catalyzes the synthesis of thymidylate, a precursor for DNA synthesis [57]. Many viruses lack thymidylate synthetase protein and depend on host machinery for viral replication. In humans, cell death was observed due to deficiency in intracellular concentration of thymidylate and subsequent stoppage of DNA synthesis, when thymidylate synthetase was suppressed [58].\nOverall, the WSSV is capable of synthesizing all the four dNTPs required for the synthesis of DNA. The presence of these DNA synthesis related enzymes in WSSV might have benefitted the virus in viral genome replication, persistence of infection and capacity to infect a wide range of host [59].\nOverall, for WSSV, where diverse nomenclature exists for different isolates, the MRF tool gave new insights on deleted CDS in various isolates in a single annotation nomenclature. As tables of deleted CDS can be obtained ready-made in MRF tool, the comprehension of any new WSSV genomes in terms of complete or partial deletions in important structural and functional genes would become easier. In brief, the findings of the study have proven the utility of MRF in case of a doublestranded DNA virus like WSSV that has problems in gene annotation."

For example, we have compared the WSSV accessions, AF332093 [11] and KX686117 [60] using both the MRF and the BLAST. The BLAST search reported a high similarity between genomes (99.76%) supported by 1242 alignments (p51 in user manual). So, with BLAST, the quest to map the base coordinates contributing to the 5\u00a0 kb length difference between these two genomes would be a cumbersome exercise as one has to manually go through all the alignments considering the percentage identity and query coverage for each alignment. Added to this, the inconsistent start positions in linear sequence accession of these circular genomes pose further complications. The MRF, dependent on exact match algorithm directly tabulated the missing genomic regions and missing CDS and also depicted them in a MirCos plot (Fig.\u00a04).\nHere, for certain CDS such as wsv095 and wsv164, BLAST could retrieve hits only in runs with reduced word length [11] as alignments of these CDS have lowcomplexity regions and are ignored in default run (Additional file\u00a016). In case of wsv178, a CDS with repeat-rich regions, BLAST failed to report partial deletions because several repeat regions in query genome made multiple alignments across a single repeat region of subject genome leading to a positive hit with 100% query coverage (Fig.\u00a05). As MRF relies on exact matches, it could report hits to wsv095 and wsv164 and could identify partial deletions in repeat regions of wsv178 in standard run with default parameters.\nInsights with\u00a0African swine fever virus case While comparing the non-pathogenic (OURT88/3, AM712240) and highly pathogenic (Benin 97/1, AM712239) ASFV isolates varying in genome length, we noticed that MRF handles highly similar genes better than BLAST search. It is observed that the BLAST reported false alignments for certain CDS (for example, MGF 505-2R gene in OURT 88/3 isolate). For \u2018MGF 505- 2R\u2019, MRF printed a completely missing report whereas BLAST reported a weak alignment. Examination of CDS annotation of OURT88/3 genome revealed that it does not have \u2018MGF 505-2R\u2019. Further, when the coordinates of the hit region were examined, it was found to be the sequence of \u2018MGF 505-10R\u2019. This is an alignment between MGF 505-2R of the query and MGF 505-10R of the subject. Here BLAST search erred by falsely reporting an alignment with MGF-505-10R as a hit to MGF 505-2R. As the sequence of MGF 505-2R shares similarity with the sequence of MGF 505-10R, the BLAST with its heuristic nature of the algorithm is able to find a weak match. As the false matches were controlled by offset parameters of MRF, it could accurately print \u2018completely missing\u2019 report for MGF 505-2R (Fig.\u00a0 6). Detection of false alignments in BLAST output requires tedious task of inspecting all the individual alignments but the advanced features of MRF automatically takes care of false exact matches without need of any further steps."

Existing comparative genomic tools primarily focus on genomic similarities. Often, the loss or gains of genomic regions are attributed to the degree of virulence. In viruses with more CDS, knowledge of those major CDS differing between genomes helps researchers to quickly focus on them first. Same is the case with viruses having a high number of genomes, where advances would be rapid, if focus can be brought\ndown quickly to few genomes. The MRF complements similarity-based alignment tools in comparative genomics involving large, highly-similar, length-varying and/or inconsistently annotated viral genomes. To our knowledge, there is no other tool that instantly prints and depicts missing coding sequences in a query compared to a reference genome. In this study, with certain important virus use cases, we have demonstrated the advantage of MRF in providing detailed graphic/tabular output in less time and also in handling of highly similar, low-complexity and repeat-rich regions of the genomes. Further, MRF offers a choice for subject-matter specialists to quickly compare virus genomes of their interest and derive functionally meaningful inferences.\nMore research needs to be invested in to development of tools that focus on missing genomic regions and point mutations. In virus research, MRF provides advancement to find the differences between genomes and to quickly identify the important CDS/genomes that require early\nattention from researchers. There is scope to integrate options for detecting point mutations and the associated aminoacid changes in to the MRF tool.

The heatmap is accompanied by a clustering of genomes based on missing genome regions.\nAdditional file\u00a013. The coding sequences that are completely deleted in all WSSV isolates of each of the three clusters obtained in phylogenetic tree. In this Venn diagram, left-top circle represents cluster 1 (high-virulent), right-top circle represents cluster 2 (medium-virulent) and bottom circle represents cluster 3 (low-virulent).\nAdditional file\u00a014. List of coding sequences displaying complete deletion in certain isolates and which are harboring glycosylation sites.\nAdditional file\u00a015. Functional annotations of missing coding sequences in few WSSV isolates.\nAdditional file\u00a016. Illustration of MRF\u2019s merit in reporting results for coding sequences having low complexity regions with WSSV case (highlysimilar but length-varying genomes). For BLAST search, query is coding sequences of AF332093 genome and the subject is KX686117 genome.\nFor MRF run, the query is KX686117 genome [300223 bp] and the reference is AF332093 genome [305119 bp]. A Summary of results from BLAST search and MRF run for 2 CDS, wsv094 and wsv164. Blast failed to report hits for wsv095 and wsv164 at default parameters (word length = 28). Whereas MRF prints nil deletion in query genome for these 2 coding sequences. B BLAST prints alignment for wsv094 when run with a reduced word length of 11. C BLAST prints alignment for wsv164 when run with a reduced word length of 11. As indicated in alignments, even though there were perfect matches that were greater than the length 28 (as shown in B and C), they were not considered as High Scoring Portions (HSPs) in default run as the alignments have low-complexity regions.\nAdditional file\u00a017.
