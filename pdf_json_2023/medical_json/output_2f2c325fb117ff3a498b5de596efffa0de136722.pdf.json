    "abstractText": "Approximately 50 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, and opioids are commonly prescribed for such individuals. Unfortunately, nearly a quarter of chronic pain patients have reported misusing their prescription. We are investigating the effect of chronic pain on drug-seeking behavior at the neuronal level. Repeated drug-seeking is associated with reactivation of an ensemble of neurons sparsely scattered throughout the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Prior research has demonstrated that chronic pain increases intrinsic excitability of dmPFC neurons, which may increase the likelihood of reactivation during drug seeking. We tested the hypothesis that chronic pain would increase oxycodone seeking behavior, and that the pain state would differentially increase intrinsic excitability in dmPFC drug seeking ensemble neurons. TetTag mice self-administered intravenous oxycodone. After 7 days of forced abstinence, a drug seeking session (extinction conditions) was performed and the ensemble was tagged. Mice received spared nerve injury (SNI) to induce chronic pain during the period between a first and second seeking session, and we measured persistence of seeking between the two sessions to determine if the SNI exacerbated seeking. Following the second seeking session we performed electrophysiology on individual neurons within the dmPFC to assess intrinsic excitability of the drugseeking ensemble and non-ensemble neurons. We found significant sex differences in the effect of SNI on oxycodone seeking and electrophysiology, such that the induction of chronic pain could modulate seeking behavior in mice that have previously self-administered oxycodone prior to injury.",

Unfortunately, nearly a quarter of chronic pain patients have reported misusing their prescription. We are investigating the effect of chronic pain on drug-seeking behavior at the neuronal level. Repeated drug-seeking is associated with reactivation of an ensemble of neurons sparsely scattered throughout the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Prior research has demonstrated that chronic pain increases intrinsic excitability of dmPFC neurons, which may increase the likelihood of reactivation during drug seeking. We tested the hypothesis that chronic pain would increase oxycodone seeking behavior, and that the pain state would differentially increase intrinsic excitability in dmPFC drug seeking ensemble neurons. TetTag mice self-administered intravenous oxycodone. After 7 days of forced abstinence, a drug seeking session (extinction conditions) was performed and the ensemble was tagged. Mice received spared nerve injury (SNI) to induce chronic pain during the period between a first and second seeking session, and we measured persistence of seeking between the two sessions to determine if the SNI exacerbated seeking. Following the second seeking session we performed electrophysiology on individual neurons within the dmPFC to assess intrinsic excitability of the drugseeking ensemble and non-ensemble neurons. We found significant sex differences in the effect of SNI on oxycodone seeking and electrophysiology, such that the induction of chronic pain could modulate seeking behavior in mice that have previously self-administered oxycodone prior to injury."

            "text": "The opioid epidemic reached new heights in 2020 when the CDC reported that nearly 70,000 lives were lost due to a drug overdose involving an opioid, making up 75% of all overdoses accounted for (1). The pandemic exacerbated an already existing problem for individuals misusing opioids (2,3). Some populations of people remain particularly vulnerable to opioid misuse, including those with chronic pain (4). Nearly 50 million people worldwide struggle with chronic pain (5), and opioids are commonly prescribed to help patients cope with their discomfort (6). Chronic pain can manifest in the wake of an acute injury and is marked by persistent existing pain (even beyond tissue repair at site of injury) and is accompanied by allodynia and hyperalgesia (7). Because chronic pain is persistent, prescriptions may extend beyond a year, and many patients require dose increases to maintain analgesic effects as tolerance builds up (6). It has been reported that approximately 21-29% of chronic pain patients misuse their prescription opioids (8).\nDrug-seeking behavior can be initiated by \u201ctriggers.\u201d These include stress (9), people that are associated with one\u2019s drug use, objects, or the environment (10-12). These triggers can lead to the behavioral sequence to obtain the drug because there is a learned association between the administration of the drug, the physiological response, and the environment in which the drug is taken (6,13). The rodent dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) responds to these triggers to initiate drug seeking behavioral sequences (13). The dmPFC is also engaged during the transition from acute to chronic pain and is thought to contribute to the emotional effects of chronic pain (14,15). Taken together, it becomes evident that there is an overlap in this brain region regarding drug-seeking behavior and the affective experience of pain, although there is a lack of studies examining this overlap at the cellular level.\nWithin the dmPFC, there is evidence that a specific population of neurons, or ensemble, controls persistent substance seeking (16-19). Electrophysiological measures of pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic (PrL) region have shown that the induction of neuropathic pain in rats leads to an increase in intrinsic excitability (20). This change could be expected to increase responsiveness of dmPFC neurons to afferent inputs, such as those from drug-associated triggers, but it is unknown if these changes are happening to drug seeking ensemble neurons and if the induction of a pain state can increase drug seeking. Prior work has demonstrated that chronic pain (and inflammatory pain (21)) can elevate opioid seeking after self-administration, but these studies induced the pain state prior to opioid self-administration (22). In this design, opioids may be acting through both positive and negative (analgesic) reinforcement mechanisms. These studies concluded that the addition of negative reinforcement mechanisms was responsible for the chronic pain-associated increase in opioid seeking, although this hypothesis has not been tested. Here, we sought to examine the effects of chronic neuropathic pain on opioid seeking when the pain state occurred following opioid self-administration. We have also included females in this study, considering that there is a higher frequency of females and/or higher pain ratings across different forms of chronic pain (23).\nSince sex differences have been reported in the response to chronic pain and opioids (reviewed in (24-26). We trained male and female TetTag mice (27) to self-administer sucrose (natural reward) or oxycodone (opioid reinforcer) for 10 days followed by 7 days of forced abstinence (see timeline in Fig 1). In an initial drug seeking session on abstinence day 7, drug-seeking ensemble neurons were \u201ctagged.\u201d The next day we induced neuropathic pain via a spared nerve injury (SNI) and mice remained in forced abstinence until day 21 when mice were allowed a second drug-seeking session. We assessed seeking behavior, as well as electrophysiological measurements of ensemble and non-ensemble layer V/VI neurons in the PrL region of the dmPFC. This experimental design allowed us to distinguish the effects of chronic pain on\nopioid drug-seeking from self-administration and the associated intrinsic excitability of the ensemble neurons in the PrL. We tested the hypothesis that SNI would increase oxycodone seeking behavior even when self-administration did not occur during the pain state. In addition to this, we tested the hypothesis that an increase in drug-seeking was associated with an increase in the intrinsic excitability of the specific drug-seeking ensemble neurons."

            "text": "Sucrose-seeking in mice is not influenced by SNI.\nIn order to answer our larger question of how neuropathic pain may affect reactivity to drug-related stimuli, we first started our experiments looking at sucrose as a natural reward. Across the 10 days of 1-hour sucrose self-administration (Fig 1a and 1b), the total number of reinforcers earned between females and males was not significantly different (Fig 1c; t(19) = 0.609, p = 0.550) therefore subsequent outcome measures were pooled between sexes. Mice were counterbalanced to either sham or SNI based on their D7 seeking. When we compared the number of nosepokes from D7 seeking (before\nSNI) to D21 seeking (after SNI) as measured by a seeking persistence ratio ( \ud835\udc3721 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54\n\ud835\udc377 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54 ) , we discovered no significant\ndifference among mice that received SNI compared to sham (Fig 1e; t(19) = 0.247, p = 0.808).\nSpecific sucrose-seeking ensemble neurons show more intrinsic excitability compared to non-ensemble neurons.\nWe hypothesized that sucrose-seeking ensemble neurons would exhibit higher intrinsic excitability compared to nonensemble neurons, as acute sucrose seeking ensemble hyperexcitability has been identified in the dmPFC of c-fos-EGFP mice (33). We measured input-output curves by recording action potentials (AP) evoked by 20 pA step current injections in both ensemble and non-ensemble neurons of sham and SNI animals (Fig 2a, 2a\u2019). When plotted as an area-under the curve (AUC), there was a main effect of ensemble neurons exhibiting higher intrinsic excitability when compared to nonensemble neurons (Fig 2b, 2b\u2019; p = 0.003) but no main or interaction effect of SNI (p = 0.965, p = 0.208). We also noted a main effect in the intrinsic excitability of ensemble neurons versus non-ensemble neurons with respect to rheobase and input resistance (Fig 2c, 2c\u2019 and 2d, 2d\u2019; p = 0.005 and p = 0.021,). Neurons from SNI mice did not show a significant difference in rheobase and input resistance when compared to sham (Fig 2c, 2c\u2019 and 2d, 2dc\u2019; p = 0.744 and p = 0.955). There were also no significant differences in resting membrane potential across injury or celltype (p = 0.257 and p =\n0.090). Taken together, there was no effect of SNI on sucrose seeking or intrinsic excitability of PrL pyramidal neurons, but sucrose seeking ensemble neurons exhibited higher intrinsic excitability when compared to non-ensemble neurons in mice that received SNI or sham injury.\n2-hour oxycodone self-administration sessions did not yield behavioral differences in seeking upon induction of SNI.\nMice self-administered oxycodone across the 10 days during 2-hour sessions, and there was no significant difference in the total number of reinforcers earned between males and females (Fig 3a and 3b; t(11) = 1.23, p = 0.244). Therefore, males and females were pooled for subsequent outcome measures. We then compared D7 seeking to D21 and showed there was no significant difference in mice that received SNI compared to sham (Fig 3c and 3d; t(11) = 0.784, p = 0.686).\nSNI did not affect intrinsic excitability of ensemble neurons in 2-hour oxycodone SA mice. We further investigated the electrophysiology of PrL pyramidal neurons given 20 pA current injections and discovered an interaction effect of injury and ensembles on action potentials (Fig 4a, 4a\u2019; p = 0.004), and a main effect of ensemble membership (Fig 4a, 4a\u2019; p = 0.048). However, we found no main effect of injury with regards to intrinsic excitability when quantified as area under the curve (Fig 4b, 4b\u2019; p = 0.358), and no significant difference in excitability of ensemble neurons or interaction with injury (Fig 4b, 4b\u2019; p = 0.640, p = 0.365). There was also no effect of SNI or ensemble membership in measures of rheobase (Fig 4c, 4c\u2019; p = 0.662, p = 0.316) or input resistance (Fig 4d, 4d\u2019; p = 0.996 and p = 0.956). There was no difference in resting membrane potential across injury or celltype (p = 0.780 and p = 0.580). Taken together, the mice in the 2-hour oxycodone self-administration group did not exhibit SNI-associated changes in drug seeking, and only showed an SNI-associated increase in intrinsic excitability with respect to area under the curve from the input-output recordings of action potentials.\nThere were sex differences in total consumption and subsequent seeking behavior in response to SNI in mice that had 6-hour oxycodone self-administration sessions.\nExtended access drug self-administration models are proposed to better model compulsive drug use in humans (34,35). Using the same timeline as previously described (Fig 1a), male and female mice learned to self-administer oxycodone across the 10-day training period (Fig 5a), but this time for 6-hour sessions. Across all SA sessions, the total number of\nreinforcers earned per animal was calculated. There was a significant difference in the total summation of reinforcers following self-administration, such that females earned nearly 2-fold reinforcers of oxycodone than males (Fig 5b; t(26) = 4.07, p = 0.0004). Due to this difference, subsequent outcome measures were analyzed separately for each sex. D7 seeking values were counterbalanced for assignment to sham or SNI, and individual measurements in seeking behavior were plotted (Fig 5c and 5d). When quantified as a persistence ratio, interestingly, female mice that were given SNI following D7 seeking significantly increased their seeking behavior on D21 (Fig 5e; t(10) = 3.553 , p = 0.0052). When we examined the male seeking behavior, we saw no significant difference in male mice assigned to the SNI group (Fig 5f; t(12) = 0.421, p = 0.681). There was no significant association between intake and persistence ratio (r2 = 0.002, p = 0.892), suggesting that the sex difference in intake did not contribute to the SNI-increased oxycodone seeking. Thus, chronic pain induced by SNI increased seeking 2 weeks later, specifically in females but not male mice.\n6-hour oxycodone SA females exhibited a significant increase in PrL intrinsic excitability in response to SNI.\nWe then investigated our hypothesis at the neuronal level, postulating that an increase in intrinsic excitability specifically within the ensemble neurons could be responsible, in part, for an increase in behavioral seeking behavior in females. In female mice, we found that there was a significant main effect of SNI on the intrinsic excitability, such that the SNI neurons were had greater action potential firing in response to current injections when compared to sham (Fig 6a, 6a\u2019; p < 0.001). However, the significance seen was largely driven by the non-ensemble neurons and is not specific to an increase in ensemble intrinsic excitability (see AUC, Fig 6b, 6b\u2019). An interaction effect of injury*celltype was also discovered in the number of APs fired (Fig 6a, 6a\u2019; p < 0.001). Additionally, significant differences were also detected as a main effect among ensemble versus non-ensemble neurons with respect to rheobase (Fig 6c, 6c\u2019; p < 0.001) and input resistance (Fig 6d, 6d\u2019; p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the resting membrane potential of neurons recorded from across injury or ensemble membership (p = 0.598 and p = 0.363). Given the increase in intrinsic excitability seen with respect to the APs, we wanted to see if there was an association with an increase in seeking as measured by the persistence ratio, so we plotted the persistence ratio against the AUC value using a linear mixed effect regression. While there was no significant association from injury, we did detect a significant difference of persist_ratio*celltype (Fig 6e, 6e\u2019; p = 0.001), such that an increase in intrinsic excitability of cell type showed a relationship with an increase in seeking persistence. There was no main effect of injury.\nIn male mice, when we recorded the number of action potentials following 20 pA steps and plotted AUC, we noted no\nsignificant difference of SNI mice when compared to sham in the number of action potentials (Fig 6f, 6f\u2019; (APs) p = 0.368 and Fig 6g, 6g\u2019; (AUC) p = 0.860), however we did detect a significant difference in the ensemble neuron cell excitability compared to non-ensemble neurons (Fig 6f, 6f\u2019; (APs) p < 0.001 and Fig 6g, 6g\u2019; (AUC) p = 0.001). There was no significant change in cell excitability comparing SNI to sham with respect to rheobase and input resistance (Fig 6h, 6h\u2019; p = 0.330 and Fig 6i, 6i\u2019; p = 0.253), nor for ensemble membership (Fig 6h, 6h\u2019; p = 0.112 and Fig 6i, 6i\u2019; p = 0.825). Resting membrane potential yielded no significant differences across injury or celltype (p = 0.363 and p = 0.570). Despite a lack of significance in behavioral changes or electrophysiological changes resulting from SNI, we still examined the relationship between persistence ratio and AUC value as we did in the females and discovered that there was in fact a significant association across injury, such that mice with a higher persistence ratio yielded a significant relationship with a decrease in neuron AP AUC values (Fig 6j, 6j\u2019; p = 0.012). This association was not observed in relation to cell type.\nTaken together, when female mice received SNI after their initial drug seeking session, two weeks later we saw an increase in seeking behavior; this was not seen in the male mice. When we recorded from PrL pyramidal neurons in females, we discovered that neurons from SNI mice exhibited higher intrinsic excitability (as measured by APs and AP AUC,) than sham, and this difference was largely driven by the non-ensemble neurons. When we recorded from PrL pyramidal neurons in males, we saw a significant difference in ensemble neurons compared to non-ensemble neurons with respect to APs and AP AUC, but there was no significant difference in neurons recorded from SNI mice compared to sham across any of the measures of intrinsic excitability."

            "text": "Here, we examined the effects of neuropathic pain on natural and drug reward seeking behavior and neuronal excitability in the PrL. Using the TetTag mouse model we captured D7 seeking ensemble neurons and compared intrinsic excitability of these neurons to non-ensemble neurons. We demonstrated that mice that self-administered sucrose or short-access (2 hour) oxycodone did not exhibit behavioral changes in seeking when SNI was induced after the initial seeking session. In mice that had long-access (6 hour) oxycodone self-administration, SNI induced during abstinence elevated oxycodone seeking in females, but not males. In 6-hour oxycodone females, intrinsic excitability (as measured by current-spike\nrelationship) of non-ensemble PrL pyramidal neurons in females was elevated by SNI, and excitability of PrL pyramidal neurons correlated with oxycodone seeking in female mice. The increased excitability of PrL non-ensemble cells, positive association between excitability and oxycodone seeking, and lack of either behavioral or electrophysiological changes by SNI in males suggests that SNI may have expanded the size of the dmPFC oxycodone seeking ensemble specifically in females. Pain-associated ensembles that are necessary for driving pain-associated changes in affect have been identified in the basolateral amygdala and dmPFC (36,37). The dmPFC pain ensemble was found to project to regions important in opioid seeking, including the nucleus accumbens and central amygdala (36), suggesting that this ensemble could overlap with a previously established drug seeking ensemble. Additionally, longitudinal calcium imaging studies within the PrL region of the dmPFC have shown that weakly tuned neurons at early behavioral time points can be recruited into ensembles that they showed an early bias toward (38).\nMany studies have examined the comorbidity of pain and drug-seeking behavior through the lens of opioids as a negative reinforcer in which pain precedes the administration of the analgesic (21,22,39,40). In the context of acute pain, Shaham and colleagues found that intraplantar capsaicin did not cause reinstatement of fentanyl seeking, nor did intraperitoneal injections of lactic acid for heroin seeking (41). However, Hip\u00f3lito and colleagues showed that in an inflammatory pain state from CFA (Complete Freund\u2019s Adjuvant) intraplanar injections, high doses of heroin resulted in significantly more drug self-administration and the motivated behavior was maintained (as measured by progressive ratio), but this was not seen in the low dose heroin group (21). Additionally, CFA has been shown to have long-lasting affective effects, and after a single CFA injection followed by 11 days of morphine self-administration (0.2 mg/kg/infusion), morphine intake was not affected (22). However, after 13 days of abstinence, rats showed elevated drug seeking and did not extinguish leverpressing beyond 5 days. Similarly, SNI did not affect self-administration of 0.1 mg/kg/infusion morphine, but led to persistent increases in drug seeking during extinction testing (42). Our current study was designed to isolate the pain state from opioid self-administration. With the pain-associated negative reinforcement of opioid self-administration removed, we interpret our findings to indicate that in females, chronic pain-associated increases in opioid seeking can occur in the absence of opioid alleviation of pain.\nNeuropathic pain leads to neuronal and synaptic plasticity within the brain and has both short- and long-term effects at the circuit level. Alterations in limbic circuit plasticity have been observed up to 12 months post-SNI and exhibit in mice (43). While it is widely understood that the PFC projects to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in reward circuitry, this projection has also been shown to play a role during a shift from acute to chronic pain (44). Work by Guida and colleagues showed\nthat SNI mice measured at 1 and 12 months out from injury exhibited impaired long-term-potentiation (LTP) at this pathway, which they hypothesize may play a role in the affective experience of pain (43). Furthermore, dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the mPFC have been shown to play a role in the chronic pain, and optogenetic stimulation of this projection alleviated mechanical allodynia and produced a conditioned place preference (45). VTA dopaminergic neurons in a pain state contributes to anhedonia-like behavior by way of decreased intrinsic excitability of VTA DA neurons and a reduction in mesolimbic dopamine release (46). At the cellular level, prior work in rats 2 weeks out from SNI reported layer II/III pyramidal neurons in the PrL had an increase in intrinsic excitability (20). In mice, electrophysiological recordings from layer V pyramidal neurons within the PrL following SNI showed an acute peak of hyperexcitability within the first week, and then became significantly hypoexcitable at 35 days out from SNI (47). It is unknown if prior opioid exposure changes this phenomenon. Considering our observed differences in intrinsic excitability in PrL pyramidal neurons recorded from mice with sucrose or 6-hour oxycodone self-administration, opioid exposure may delay the transition from hyper- to hypo-excitability of these cells.\nMemories rely on ensemble neurons, which can be strengthened in particular brain regions when paired with a substance reinforcer (48,49). The specificity of ensembles has been described to play a role in context-induced relapse in rats that previously self-administered heroin (49), as well as work done in cocaine (48,50). The strength and population of an ensemble can grow following substance self-administration, and this has been shown through behavioral work and electrophysiological studies (50-52). Therefore, we hypothesized that the addition of neuropathic pain could perhaps further enhance the neuronal ensemble intrinsic excitability within the PFC.\nInterestingly, we saw increases in intrinsic excitability in female mice that received SNI, but this effect was isolated to non-ensemble neurons. Further analysis indicated that there was a positive association between seeking persistence and AP AUC in female, but not male mice. In males, we did not see a significant change in intrinsic excitability of sham versus SNI neurons with respect to rheobase or input resistance. We did, however, discover a relationship of higher persistence ratios in males being associated with a decrease in intrinsic excitability. While this is not what we initially hypothesized to observe, SNI-associated hypoexcitability has been shown to occur in PFC pyramidal neurons at more chronic durations than tested here (37). In our paradigm, we found that this effect was specific to males that selfadministered oxycodone compared to sucrose. Thus, we identified contingent sex differences (26) where oxycodone SA (and abstinence) interacted with SNI in a sex-dependent manner in both behavioral and electrophysiological measures, even though oxycodone and SNI were never present at the same time. While we were able to correlate our behavioral\noutcomes with the electrophysiological recordings in 6-hour oxycodone females, we can not elucidate the mechanism driving seeking in the females given our current design. Future studies are needed to determine if SNI-associated changes in oxycodone seeking and PrL excitability evolve over time, and whether the SNI-associated PrL excitability is causally linked to elevated oxycodone seeking.\nThe present studies have some limitations due to experimental design. The motivational component was important to our experiment, but we were not able to control for the total number of reinforcers earned during self-administration. It is evident that males in the 6-hour sessions did not self-administer the same number of reinforcers as the females did, and this difference in total amount of oxycodone taken could influence future seeking behavior or the physiological response to SNI. Correlations examining the relationship between intake and persistence ratio in this study did not yield a significant relationship, suggesting that intake differences do not explain sex differences in seeking. Another potential limitation of this experiment is that there may be a ceiling effect in neuron excitability, and the selective increase in nonensemble neurons in female SNI mice may be an artifact of ensemble neurons already having a maximal current-spike response. Furthermore, we used the von Frey assay to measure mechanical withdrawal throughout our study to validate maintained hyperalgesia. This measure is reflexive in nature and does not address the affective dimension of pain (53), which is largely regulated by the PFC (54,55). Therefore, assessment of pain behavior is limited to the sensory component. Finally, our measurements were only performed at a single timepoint. Future studies are needed to determine if the SNI-associated increase in oxycodone seeking (and associated neuroplasticity) occurs at more chronic timepoints."

            "text": "In conclusion, we find that chronic pain can increase oxycodone seeking in females even when drug intake preceded the pain state. Pain is reported to be a trigger for drug craving and relapse in humans (56,57), and prior substance misuse is associated with greater opioid misuse in patients with chronic pain. History of treatment in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation facility had a 93% predictive validity in determining which patients had substance misuse (58), while low dose opioid therapy did not elevate risk of developing opioid misuse in chronic pain patients without prior substance use disorder (59). Thus, our data from females are consistent with clinical reports that chronic pain can promote drug craving and relapse and support the hypothesis that chronic pain may lead to neuroadaptations which promote drug seeking."
