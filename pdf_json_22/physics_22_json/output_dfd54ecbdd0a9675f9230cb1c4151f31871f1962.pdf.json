    "abstractText": "Generally, pressure is a useful tool to modify the behavior of physical properties of materials due to the change in distance between atoms or molecules in the lattice. Barium iodide (BaI2), as one of the simplest and most prototypical iodine compounds, has substantial high pressure investigation value. In this work, we explored the crystal structures of BaI2 at a wide pressure range of 0\u2013200 GPa using a global structure search methodology. A thermodynamical structure with tetragonal I4/mmm symmetry of BaI2 was predicted to be stable at 17.1 GPa. Further electronic calculations indicated that I4/mmm BaI2 exhibits the metallic feature via an indirect band gap closure under moderate pressure. We also found that the superconductivity of BaI2 at 30 GPa is much lower than that of CsI at 180 GPa based on our electron\u2013phonon coupling simulations. Our current simulations provide a step toward the further understanding of the high-pressure behavior of iodine compounds at extreme conditions.",

            "text": "A large number of interesting properties of iodine compounds have been reported such as optical properties, conduction characteristics, catalytic performance, medical application and the hypervalence phenomenon [1\u201310]. Barium iodide (BaI2), as one of the simplest and most representative ionic iodine compounds, has attracted plentiful studies [11\u201315]. At ambient pressure, barium iodide (BaI2) shares a cotunnite-type structure (orthorhombic Pnma, Z = 4) [11] with many other dihalides AX2 (A = Ca, Ba, Pb, Sn) [16] Under high pressure, a new high-pressure phase of BaI2 with monoclinic P1121/a (Z = 8) symmetry between 12 and 15 GPa was reported in 1995 [13]. Curiously, this previous work identified the monoclinic P1121/a phase at a pressure range of 20\u201340 GPa [13]. Moreover, the latest theoretical work in 2015 reported that BaI2 maintains insulator characteristics at least up to 40 GPa [15]. The superconducting behavior of CsI has been reported by experimental and theoretical works [7,17,18], where the external pressure reached 180 GPa. BaI2, as one of the most representative iodine compounds, shares a similar prototype with CsI. According to the reported superconducting mechanism of CsI, the increasing number of electrons of Cs is responsible for superconductivity, and the Ba atom with more electrons is potentially superior to the Cs atom in the electron\u2013phonon coupling. Thus, it is an interesting topic to investigate the conduction characteristics at lowering pressure, which implies much more application value. To the best of our knowledge, the highest pressure studied in previous work for BaI2 was lower than 40 GPa, and the whole high-pressure structural transition sequence up to 200 GPa is still far from being clear and well established. These structural uncertainties impede the in-depth understanding and further exploration of the electronic properties of BaI2 under compression. Here, we present systematic structure searches for BaI2 at high pressures using our developed CALYPSO method [19\u201322]. Our results show that BaI2 adopts orthorhombic\nMaterials 2022, 15, 522. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15020522 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022, 15, 522 2 of 8\nPnma symmetry at 0 GPa, which is consistent with experimental work [11,13]. Furthermore, we identified one thermodynamically stable tetragonal I4/mmm phase for BaI2 at high pressure which is energetically superior to the previously reported post-cotunnite phase (P1121/a, Z = 8) [13]. Further electronic calculations showed that BaI2 becomes a metallic phase via indirect band gap closure at moderate compression. In addition, the simulations also suggest the superconductive feature of BaI2 at 30 GPa [7]."

This computational scheme was verified by many works [23\u201327]. We used Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (PBE-GGA) [28] exchange correlation for the simulations, where the VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation package) code was also employed [29]. Furthermore, we used the Phonopy code to investigate the dynamic properties of the predicted structures [30]. The Device Studio [31] program provides a number of functions for performing visualization, modeling and simulation. We used Bader\u2019s quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis [32] to investigate the charge properties of the predicted structures. Superconductivity was studied by density-functional perturbation theory [33,34], where the Quantum-ESPRESSO package [35,36] was used."

According to our simulations, at ambient pressure, the cotunnitetype Pnma (Z = 4) phase of BaI2 is the thermodynamically optimal structure (Figure 1). From Figure 1c, each barium atom was surrounded by nine iodine atoms, and all the atoms of the primitive cell were packed in an orthorhombic cage. The optimized lattice parameter of the Pnma phase takes a = 9.003 \u00c5, b = 5.448 \u00c5 and c = 10.879 \u00c5 at ambient pressure, which is close to experiment data with a = 8.922 \u00c5, b = 5.304 \u00c5 and c = 10.695 \u00c5 [11].

Electronic density of states of I4/mmm BaI2 at 30 GPa (d).\nThe superconducting behavior of CsI has been extensively explored by experimental and theoretical methods [7,17\u201319]. Therefore, it is noteworthy to study the superconductivity of BaI2 at high pressure. In this work, we performed electron\u2013phonon coupling calculations for BaI2. We provide the Eliashberg spectral function \u03b12F(\u03c9) [38] (Figure 5) and the phonon density of states (PHDOS) of BaI2 at 30 GPa. It is clearly seen that \u03b12F(\u03c9) can be roughly divided into three parts: low (0.49\u20131.25 THz), medium (1.25\u20135.78 THz) and high frequency (5.78\u20136.51 THz). We employed the Allen\u2013Dynes modified McMillan equation [39] \ud835\udc47 = . exp \u2212 . ( )\u2217( . ) to estimate the superconductivity of the predicted structures, where \u03c9log is the logarithmic average frequency, and \u03bc* is the Coulomb pseudopotential. At 30 GPa, \u03c9log was 132.62 K, while at 200 GPa, it was 207.23 K. Furthermore, we found that the estimated superconducting critical temperature TC for BaI2 was 1.27 K at 30 GPa and 0.35 K at 200 GPa. Moreover, two recent studies reported non-adiabatic superconductivity in sibling BKBO [40] and low-dimensional LiC6 [41]. These studies presented a coherent interpretation of the superconductivity. In our work, the relatively lower bottom of the conduction band of BaI2 implies the potential influence of non-adiabatic effects, and this may be an interesting orientation in future work.\nFigure 4.
