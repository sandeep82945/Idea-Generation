    "abstractText": "Objectives Clinical data on retaining extensively damaged teeth using forced orthodontic extrusion followed by restorative rehabilitation are scarce, and economic evaluations are basically absent. A health economic evaluation of this method was performed based on a clinical study. Materials and methods In a convenience sample of individuals recruited from routine care, extensively damaged teeth were orthodontically extruded prior to restoration. Patients were followed up for up to 6 years. The health outcome was tooth retention time. Direct medical, non-medical, and indirect initial and follow-up costs were estimated using the private payer\u2019s perspective in German healthcare. Association of initial direct medical treatment costs and cofounding variables was analyzed using generalized linear models. Success and survival were secondary outcomes. Results A total of 35 teeth in 30 patients were followed over a mean \u00b1 SD of 49 \u00b1 19 months. Five patients (14%) dropped out during that period. Median initial costs were 1941\u20ac (range: 1284\u20134392\u20ac), median costs for follow-up appointments were 215\u20ac (range: 0\u20135812\u20ac), and median total costs were 2284\u20ac (range: 1453 to 7109\u20ac). Endodontic re-treatment and placement of a post had a significant impact on total costs. Three teeth had to be extracted and in three patients orthodontic relapse was observed. The survival and success rates were 91% and 83%, respectively. Conclusions Within the limitations of this clinical study, total treatment costs for orthodontic extrusion and subsequent restoration of extensively damaged teeth were considerable. Costs were by large generated initially; endodontic and postendodontic therapies were main drivers. Costs for retreatments due to complications were limited, as only few complications arose. Clinical relevance The restoration of extensively damaged teeth after forced orthodontic extrusion comes with considerable initial treatment costs, but low follow-up costs. Overall and over the observational period and within German healthcare, costs are below those for tooth replacement using implant-supported crowns.

The amount of residual tooth structure and the defect location have been shown to have a significant role in the long-term prognosis of both tooth and restoration [1]. Subgingival and subcrestal defects are particularly challenging as they usually violate the biologic width [2, 3] and as a circumferential ferrule design preparation is necessary for long-term success of post-endodontic restorations [4]. Hence, surgical crown\n* Maria Bruhnke maria.bruhnke@charite.de\n1 Department of\u00a0Prosthodontics, Geriatric Dentistry and\u00a0Craniomandibular Disorders, Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of\u00a0Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Humboldt\u2013Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin and\u00a0Berlin Institute of\u00a0Health, A\u00dfmannshauser Stra\u00dfe 4-6, 14197\u00a0Berlin, Germany\n2 Department of\u00a0Oral Diagnostics, Digital Health and\u00a0Health Services Research, Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of\u00a0Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Humboldt\u2013 Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin and\u00a0Berlin Institute of\u00a0Health, A\u00dfmannshauser Stra\u00dfe 4-6, 14197\u00a0Berlin, Germany\n1 3\nlengthening [5] or orthodontic extrusion [6, 7] are two strategies employed prior to restorative procedures if extensively damaged teeth with such subgingival or subcrestal defects are to be retained.\nSurgical crown lengthening is associated with esthetic and biologic disadvantages due to the lengthening of the clinical crown [8] and the osseous reduction of the alveolar bone level [9, 10], which is why forced orthodontic extrusion is increasingly discussed as a possible alternative [11, 12]. Orthodontic extrusion may be regarded a minimally invasive and maximally tissue preservative treatment procedure [13]. Alternatives to tooth retention involve extraction and (implant or otherwise supported) replacement of the tooth [14].\nWhile there is a wealth of data towards the survival and prognosis of tooth-supported fixed dental prostheses [15] or implant-supported restorations [16], data on extensively damaged teeth which were orthodontically extruded and subsequently restored is extremely limited [11, 12]. In a recent clinical study, a survival rate of 94% was reported for extensively damaged teeth after forced orthodontic extrusion over a mean observation period of 3.3\u00a0years, and orthodontic relapse was demonstrated as the major complication of this treatment method [12].\nBesides efficacy (longevity, survival), costs of a therapy are increasingly seen as a relevant aspect to consider during decision-making, as they are relevant for payers on all levels (patients, insurances, public funds) but also providers. For orthodontic extrusion and restoration of extensively damaged teeth, any such health economic data is largely absent, and hence any comparison with the discussed alternatives (tooth extraction and replacement) is impossible when it comes to economic aspects.\nIt was the aim of the present study to perform a health economic evaluation of orthodontically extruded and subsequently restored, extensively damaged teeth using routinely collected data of the discussed clinical study. The results of this study are of interest for patients, providers, and further decision-makers in dental healthcare."

The following inclusion criteria were defined: patients with (1) permanent teeth with subgingival or subcrestal defect, with (2) two proximal contact points, (3) pocket probing depths of \u2264 2\u00a0mm, (4) defects violating the biologic width and lacking the option for ferrule design preparation, (5) a prospective crown-root ratio not exceeding 1, (6) tooth mobility \u2264 I, and (7) expected to require a single crown restoration. Patients of 18\u00a0years and older were assessed for eligibility. Both endodontically treated as well as vital teeth were included. Radiographs were obtained before treatment to assess the apical condition of the tooth and to determine the need for endodontic treatment or retreatment. Teeth with a remaining residual dentin thickness at the orifice of the canal of more than 1\u00a0mm and a ferrule height of 2\u00a0mm after extrusion were included. Exclusion criteria were (1) teeth with hypercementosis or (2) vertical root fractures, (3) molars, (4) tooth mobility \u2265 II, (5) probing depths of \u2265 3\u00a0mm, and (6) teeth with prospective crown-root ratios exceeding 1. Patients should have been willing to appear for follow-up appointment over the next 5\u00a0years.\nFigure\u00a01 illustrates the clinical procedures for forced orthodontic extrusion; details are described elsewhere [19]. After removal of insufficient restorations and of all softened carious tissue, a fiber-reinforced composite-based bar (Extrusion pin, Komet Dental, Lemgo, Germany) was adhesively bonded to the root of the tooth to assist extrusion (RelyX Unicem 2 Automix, 3\u00a0M, Neuss, Germany). A second bar was luted onto the surface of the neighboring teeth using an etch-and-rinse adhesive (OptiBond FL, Kerr, Kloten, Schweiz) and a flowable composite (Tetric EvoFlow, Ivoclar, Schaan, Liechtenstein). Orthodontic elastics were used for occlusal movement of the root (> 0.5N). Supracrestal fiberectomy and scaling and root planning were performed [20]. Patients were instructed to change the elastics two times a day. After successful extrusion, teeth were adhesively bonded to the second bar and to the neighboring teeth with a flowable composite (Tetric EvoFlow) for a retention period of at least 8\u00a0weeks. After non-surgical re-treatment of existing root-canal fillings (if present), glass-fiber reinforced composite posts (X-Post, DentsplySirona, Bensheim, Germany) were placed with a self-adhesive resin cement (RelyX Unicem 2 Automix) in teeth with one or less residual coronal walls before final restoration (n = 24). For one tooth (central incisor), X-Post No3 (blue coding/1.67-mm diameter); for 15 teeth\n1 3\n(4 lateral incisors, 3 central incisors, 2 canines, 6 premolars), X-Post No2 (red coding/1.47-mm diameter); and for 8 teeth (1 central incisor, 2 lateral incisors, 1 canine, 4 premolars), X-Post No1 (yellow coding/1.35-mm diameter) were used. Patients were contacted once a year during follow-up. Initial therapy procedures were performed under supervision of one operator (MB). Clinical and radiological re-examinations were performed by one operator (MB). Periodontal assessment was performed with the aid of a periodontal probe (HS-Parodontometer CP15; Henry Schein) under local anesthesia by the same operator. Radiographs were taken using paralleling technique. Analysis of radiographic images of extrusion and at recall is described elsewhere in detail [12]."

For members of the statutory insurance, nearly all dental procedures are fully covered, while only few need to be partially or fully paid out-of-pocket or by private (additional) insurances. Forced orthodontic extrusion and the associated procedures are usually not covered by the public insurance, which is\n1 3\nwhy direct medical costs were estimated using the private payer\u2019s perspective."

For GOZ, factoring of fee items is routine to determine individual costs reflecting complexity and time consumption of therapeutic procedures. In the present study, costs were calculated using the standard multiplication factor of 2.3; this is in line with previous research [23]. Calculation of costs with the aid of average national multiplication fees has shown no significant impact on cost-effectiveness [24]. Laboratory and material costs were similarly accounted for by using fee items. Costs estimations were subdivided in initial treatment costs and treatment costs for follow-up appointments for each tooth and patient individually, including costs for managing possible complications. Direct medical costs were calculated as the sum of all treatment and laboratory costs, including initial clinical and radiographical examinations, diagnostic models, forced orthodontic extrusion, post-and-core restorations, endodontic and periodontal procedures, final coronal restorations, as well as follow-up treatments. The number of appointments and patient\u2019s addresses were derived from electronic records. Based on the patients address information in the electronic record, the number of kilometers was calculated per outward and return journey for one appointment. These travel costs were multiplied by a fixed fee per kilometers travel distance based on the German standard tax tariffs (0.3). These travel costs were defined as initial direct non-medical costs. Costs for time spent traveling and dental appointments were defined as indirect costs (opportunity costs). Calculation of time in minutes spend traveling was based on patient\u2019s addresses. Time in minutes spent in dental appointments was derived from electronic calendars as well as time of photographic documentation. Due to a lack of primary data, indirect costs that were associated with patient\u2019s waiting times or sick leave (e.g., after implantation) were not accounted for. Costs were multiplied by the average net hourly wage in Germany in each specific year of treatment. Costs were calculated both over the total period and per year of follow-up."

The mean observation time was 49.1 \u00b1 18.9\u00a0months. Five patients (14%) dropped out during follow-up: Four patients were not available for follow-up appointments due to no valid contact data, and one patient due to death.\nIn six patients and six teeth, complications arose. (1) Three teeth in three patients had to be extracted due to fractures: One upper first premolar fractured in a patient with a history of bruxism. Furthermore, two lateral upper incisors fractured. For both teeth, a narrow diameter of the root became evident after extrusion due to the anatomical taper of the extruded tooth. (2) In three patients, some degree of orthodontic relapse was documented. However, as restorations remained intact, they were not renewed. This relapse was clinically acceptable to both patients and the operator. Thus, survival rate was 91% and success rate 83%. Figure\u00a02 illustrates the cumulative survival rate. Table\u00a01 provides on overview of all initial, follow-up, and total costs in Euro (\u20ac). Initial total costs were 1941.4\u20ac ranging from 1283.5 to 4392.2\u20ac, follow-up total costs were 215.2\u20ac ranging from 0 to 5812.1\u20ac, and overall total costs were 2283.6\u20ac ranging from 1452.5 to 7108.6 \u20ac.\nMean tooth survival was 46 \u00b1 20\u00a0 months. In three patients, costs during follow-up were particularly high as teeth were extracted and replaced. For two patients, teeth were replaced with fixed dental prostheses, and total costs were 1595 and 1694.9\u20ac, respectively (initial direct medical costs: 86.4/28.8\u20ac; initial direct non-medical costs: 149.62/306.8\u20ac; initial indirect costs: 1359/1359.39\u20ac). One patient received an implant-supported single crown accounting to overall costs of 4827.5\u20ac (initial direct medical costs: 4654.9\u20ac; initial direct non-medical costs: 9.6\u20ac; initial indirect costs: 163\u20ac).\nInitial direct medical costs did not differ between gender and age. Tooth position did not have a significant impact on\n1 3\ndirect medical costs. However, endodontic treatment as well as re-treatment and placement of post had a significant impact. Table\u00a02 provides the association of initial direct medical costs and covariates (gender, age, endodontic treatment, revision, post, tooth type, and jaw).\nTotal costs were higher for initial treatment in comparison to follow-up.

Notably, these teeth generated high costs for retreatment, mainly as replacement was expensive. Overall, costs were mainly generated initially. The findings of the present study need more in-depth discussion.\nFirst, according to the analysis, retaining excessively damaged teeth using forced orthodontic extrusion and subsequent restoration is likely to be less costly initially than tooth removal and subsequent implant placement in the chosen healthcare setting and perspective, where implantsupported crowns come with initial direct medical costs of\naround 4700\u20ac. Costs are comparable to a calculation using the national fee averages from the 2009 American Dental Association survey of dental fees [26]. The findings corroborate a recent EAO consensus conference narrative review which concluded that, for example, retaining central incisors with irreversible pulpitis and coronal lesions using root canal treatment was more cost-effective than implant-supported single crowns [27]. A similarly high cost-effectiveness of tooth retention has been demonstrated in an health economic evaluation using a US perspective [26] and a range of other studies [28, 29]. Notably, none of these evaluations focused on deeply destroyed teeth; the present study now adds a piece to this jigsaw. Also note, however, that both clinical success, treatment needs, and the resulting cost-effectiveness will be heavily determined by a wide range of clinical factors, like restorability, quality of bone and overall dental conditions, the individual esthetic demands, and general health conditions [30]. Moreover, cost estimations highly depend on the method of extrusion as it may be achieved by various ways, e.g., banding full arches and applying occlusal forces with the aid of elastics [31], applying magnetic extrusion procedures [32], as well as the use of removable orthodontic appliances [33] or existing removable partial dentures [34]. Moreover, surgical extrusion may be regarded as an alternative technique [35, 36]. This method might possibly result in rather low opportunity costs at initiation of treatment due to a minimized number of visits.\nSecond, and along these lines, costs were associated with a range of aspects, most importantly the need for endodontic retreatment or post placement. Both, endodontic retreatment and post placement significantly influenced cost estimations. These findings are comprehensive as both treatment procedures are expenses that play a role in cost analysis in addition to the actual procedures of forced orthodontic extrusion.\n1 3\nWhen informing patients towards treatment decisions, these aspects should be borne in mind. Patient\u2019s age, gender, tooth type, and type of jaw did not influence treatment costs significantly. As gender and patient\u2019s age did not affect tooth survival in long-term clinical trials investigating different post systems [37], these findings are not surprising. Notably, the finding that anterior teeth are at higher risk of complications due to high shear forces compared to the posterior zone was not confirmed by results of the present study [1]. However, data are in line with another clinical study on teeth requiring forced orthodontic extrusion [11] and describing orthodontic intrusion as a major complication of this technique.\nThird, if complications arose, retreatment costs were considerable, mainly as tooth replacement was cost-intense. It is conceivable that failure risk increases over time, which is why even longer follow-up periods than the one in this study are needed to establish sound estimates of failure risk. Moreover, it may be that under a worst-case scenario, immediate tooth removal and replacement could be more cost-effective than the costly tooth retention via orthodontic extrusion. Comparative analyses are required to assess this relative cost-effectiveness ranking.\nThis study has a number of strengths and limitations. First, it is the first study focusing on the economic evaluation of retaining teeth using orthodontic extrusion. Moreover, cost estimates reflected the true costs to payers and society in Germany. Second, and as a limitation, these costs may not apply to other settings and health care systems given the specific way they were derived. Third, our sample size was small, which may impact on the robustness of our cost estimates, but also the power to detect significant associations of various cofounding variables and costs. Fourth, treatment protocols were highly standardized, and all teeth were managed by the same dentists; clinical success but also costs may differ if other operators are considered (as they may perform differently, but also employ different restorative and/or surgical approaches). Moreover, the applied extrusion set described in the present study is currently no longer available for purchase. Therefore, a modified workflow with glass-fiber reinforced composite posts supplied by another manufacturer will be necessary in future research. Overall, and given the nature of this study, our findings should be interpreted with caution and require further confirmation."
