    "abstractText": "As a result of the pandemic, many patients with an inflammatory rheumatic disease (IRD) have isolated themselves. The lack of disease management together with fear of infection could lead to changes in physicaland mental health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the socialand health behaviour in patients with an IRD compared with the behaviour of healthy individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was a questionnaire survey answered by patients with an IRD and healthy individuals (HI). The questionnaire contained seven sections with questions regarding COVID-19 and quality of life including SF-36, EQ-5D-5L, and visual analogue scale (VAS) pain, fatigue and global health. Of 1663 invited participants, 661 patients with IRD and 266 HI were included in the analyses. Patients with an IRD felt more isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with HI (IRD: 9.5% (61/644), HI: 3.1% (8/259), p-value = 0.001). More HI (5.4%) had been infected with COVID-19 than patients with an IRD (1.7%). Among patients with an IRD those with worse self-reported disease activity outcomes (VAS pain, fatigue and global health, all p-value < 0.001), worse social functioning and emotional well-being were more isolated than individuals with low disease activity. Patients with an IRD feel more isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to HI. Isolation seems to be most pronounced in patients with worse disease related patientreported outcomes and lower quality of life.",

Patients with an IRD are often at high risk of infection, due to treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, immune dysregulation and comorbidities [2, 3]. Previous studies from Denmark [1, 4] showed that patients with IRD have higher risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19 infection than the general population and that patients with rheumatoid arthritis may be at higher risk of a severe course of illness with COVID-19 than the general\nTobias Eschricht Eriksen and Wilfred K.

However, the study by Cordtz et\u00a0al. showed that treatment with immunosuppressive medication does not force a greater risk [1].\nAs a result of the pandemic, many patients with an IRD have isolated themselves, making the disease management more difficult [5]. A study by Glintborg et\u00a0al. investigated self-protection strategies and health behaviour in Danish patients with an IRD and found widespread anxiety and self-isolation among patients with an IRD [5]. The interplay between self-isolation, complex disease management and fear of infection could lead to changes in both physical- and mental health [6]. The aim of this study was to evaluate the difference in self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic between patients with an IRD and healthy individuals (HI). Furthermore, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and social functioning in patients with an IRD compared with HI were investigated."

The HI did not have an inflammatory rheumatic disease or any other severe chronic disease; however, individuals with osteoarthritis were eligible. An invite to the questionnaire survey was sent out by letter to patients with an IRD through the patients\u2019 individual electronic mailbox (eBoks) on March 18, 2021, and could be answered until May 1, 2021. The letter contained a link to access the questionnaire in Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). Between March 17, 2021 and May 1, 2021 HI were enrolled from a Facebook post from Aalborg University Hospital with information about the trial and a link to access the questionnaire REDCap. The survey was conducted according to Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES) [7]. All participants accessed the closed survey in REDCap where data were stored in a dedicated electronic case report form (e-CRF) only accessible to research personnel conducting the study in the REDCap system hosted by the North Denmark Region [8, 9]. The participants were informed about the length of time of the survey, which data were stored and where and for how long, who the investigator was, and the purpose of the study. The survey was voluntary and no incentives were offered. The participants were asked to state if they wanted to participate (yes/no). Patients answering \u201cyes\u201d continued the survey. The respondents were able to review and change their answers during the survey before submission. To avoid multiple responses by same participant the civil registration number (Danish Civil Registration System) was required.\nThe usability and technical functionality of the electronic questionnaire had been tested by all the investigators before fielding the questionnaire. Furthermore, 25 research and health personal and two patients answered the survey and the survey was revised once according to the identified queries."

Additionally, patients with an IRD were given some further questions regarding their specific disease and treatment. The questionnaire about COVID-19, and behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic, has previously been used in studies of COVID-19 in patients with IRD [5] yet not validated. These questions were all statements with tick box categories with general attitude measurement and easy to complete. Adaptive questioning (items only conditionally displayed based on previous responses) was used to reduce number and complexity of the questions. VAS pain, fatigue and global health, SF-36, EQ-5D-5L and FACIT-F have all been validated in previous studies [10\u201317]. All survey answers were collected and saved in REDCap."

Additional analyses comparing patients\n1 3\nwith IRD > 50\u00a0years with HI > 50\u00a0years was performed. To compare the IRD with similar age group of HI, a sensitivity analysis was performed for < 50 and \u2265 50\u00a0years separately.\nProtocol violations were pre-defined in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) to ensure validity and reliability.

Similarly, patients with an IRD who felt isolated also reported lower scores in all questions regarding SF-36 (all p < 0.001), EQ-VAS (p = 0.01) and FACIT-Fatigue (p < 0.001) (Table\u00a03).\nThe impact of\u00a0COVID\u201119 on\u00a0the\u00a0disease management in\u00a0patients with\u00a0inflammatory rheumatic disease\nOne hundred and eighteen patients with IRD (28.0%) had dose alterations of their immunosuppressive medication during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of these patients were recommended the change by the Department of Rheumatology; however, 9.3% changed their medication because of fear of COVID-19.\n1 3\nOnly 10.7% postponed an outpatient visit for rheumatic disease during the past year as a consequence of COVID19 and 9.2% actively rejected health-offers. Most patients had an acceptable symptom state (PASS \u201cYes\u201d, 76.6%) (Table\u00a04)."

            "text": "This study represents a large questionnaire survey of patients with an IRD compared with HI investigating the impact of COVID-19 on social- and health behaviour and quality of\nlife. This study demonstrated significantly more isolation in patients with an IRD than HI. While the difference between groups were less pronounced when comparing IRD patients and HI > 50\u00a0years of age, patients with IRD > 50\u00a0years of age still felt more isolated. Furthermore, isolation seems to be most pronounced in patients with worse disease-related patient-reported outcomes and lower quality of life.\nA previous study investigating changes in behaviour, anxiety and self-isolation among patients with an IRD found high levels of anxiety and self-protection [5]. However, the patients were not compared to HI. In the present study the results demonstrated significantly more isolation in patients\n1 3\nwith an IRD than HI. A possible explanation for the observed difference between patients and HI could be that patients with an IRD are at greater risk of any infection and, therefore, self-isolate to a higher degree [9]. The observed selfisolation could be a possible explanation for the significantly lesser number of patients with an IRD tested for COVID-19 than HI. Moreover, significantly fewer patients with an IRD had been tested positive for COVID-19. Some of the patients with an IRD had one or multiple comorbidities, which could have affected their need of isolation. Therefore, it is not clear\nwhether the comorbidities of the patients with an IRD had an influence on their need to isolate.\nThis study showed that patients with an IRD were more afraid of being infected with COVID-19 than HI. This result is in agreement with findings of a previous study, where a high degree of fear of COVID-19 was reported by patients with an IRD during the first wave [5]. Thus, it seems that the fear of COVID-19 among patients with an IRD persists, i.e. is nearly the same a year after the start of the pandemic.\nPatients with an IRD who felt isolated during COVID19 pandemic reported worse VAS pain, fatigue and global\n1 3\nhealth compared with patients with an IRD who did not feel isolated. This could indicate more isolation among patients with higher self-reported disease activity. However, patients with an IRD feeling isolated had a worse social functioning, emotional well-being and, therefore, it is not clear whether the patients isolated because of disease activity, affected mental health or both. Furthermore, disease activity and mental health could be interrelated. Our findings concerning social functioning and mental health correlate with results by Cleaton et\u00a0al. [6], where isolated patients with an IRD had worse mental health than non-isolating patients with an IRD. Furthermore, the present study found that patients with an IRD had worse social functioning compared with HI measured by SF-36. Patients with an IRD also reported a lower emotional wellbeing (sub score in SF-36) compared with HI.\nThis study revealed that 9.3% of 118 patients with an IRD had a dose alteration due to the fear of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the majority of the patients did not change their medication due to the pandemic.\nOne out of ten patients with an IRD had postponed an outpatient visit for rheumatic disease during the past year. A study by Michaud et\u00a0al. [18], found that 20.8% of the rheumatic patients in the United States of America either cancelled or postponed their appointments. The difference in postponements/cancellations could, however, be explained by the difference in health care systems in Denmark versus US. However, this could also be explained by the difference in death numbers caused by COVID-19 in these countries and indicate that patients with an IRD in Denmark do not have the same impact on disease care because of COVID-19 as in the United States of America.\nThe study does have important limitations. Data were based on a questionnaire and patient-reported outcomes. All the information was provided by the participants including diagnosis and medication and was not verified. However, only patients with a rheumatic diagnosis and an active course in the department of rheumatology were asked to participate. A larger population could also have improved the study.\nThe difference in age between patients with IRD and HI is another limitation. Since age is an important factor in COVID-19 infection, analysis for patients and HI > 50\u00a0years was performed separately. Another limitation was the contact method to the patients. With a single mail through e-Boks the questionnaire was sent to those patients registered at the Department of Rheumatology at Aalborg University Hospital with a possible bias towards patients with more ITknowledge, greater socioeconomic status and lower disease activity participating. Furthermore, recall bias regarding the initial phase in March 2020 cannot be excluded, because this questionnaire was sent out in the beginning of February 2021.\nWhen conducting a survey-based study, no actual interviewer is present when participants are answering the questionnaire. Therefore, this prevents the investigators from gaining clarification on responses of open-ended questions where the predefined answering options may not be covering all possibilities within the questions. Furthermore, surveys conducted on the internet are also prone to erroneous reporting."

            "text": "Taking the population size into consideration, this study could indicate that patients with an IRD feel more isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with HI with fear of COVID19 having the greatest impact on social and health behaviour. Furthermore, the study implies that patients with worse selfreported disease activity, worse social functioning and emotional well-being were more isolated. This preventive strategy is important to recognize when studying patients with IRD and outcome of COVID-19. Furthermore, in the daily clinic more attention is recommended to this vulnerable group.\nAuthor contributions The research hypothesis and study conception were developed by TEE, WKHD, LU and SK.
