            "text": "Cross-institutional collaboration has gained popularity in recent years as a way to accelerate\nmedical research and facilitate quality improvement[1]. Widespread digitization efforts in the\nhealthcare industry enable the use of data-driven evidence for clinical prediction models[2],\nwhich can be ideally built using centralized data pooled from as many sources as possible. Some\nexamples of cross-regional collaborations include: the Collaborative European NeruroTrauma\nEffectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury[3], the Genotype to Phenotype Databases[4],\nthe Big Data in Cardiovascular Disease[5], the Ontario Prehospital Advanced Life Support[6],\nthe Kaiser Permanente Research Bank[7] and the Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study[8].\nHowever, such partnerships require data sharing, which is typically laborious and time-\nconsuming, and sometimes even impossible due to various privacy regulations[9], [10], for\nexample the European Union General Data Protection Regulation[11].\nFederated learning (FL), sometimes referred to as distributed learning or distributed algorithms,\ncan avoid data sharing by collectively training algorithms without exchanging patient-level\ndata[12], safeguarding patients\u2019 privacy by distributing the model-training to the data-owners\nand aggregating their results[13]. In addition to dismantling data silos, FL could also speed up\nthe development of much-needed AI models[14]. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic,\nDayan et al.[14] constructed a clinical outcomes prediction model across 20 institutes using FL.\nLuo et al. [15] studied the demographic and clinical factors that are associated with length of stay\nin COVID-19 patients using a lossless, one-shot FL algorithm[15]. There exist many applications\nof FL for medical image data, most of which use black box models from computer vision.\nInterpretable models, on the contrary, have fewer instances of FL applications despite their\npopularity in clinical research.\nAs a type of interpretable risk scoring model[16], scoring systems have been employed in\npractically every diagnostic area of medicine[17], since they offer quick and simple risk\nassessments of numerous serious medical conditions without the use of a computer[16]. Some\ntraditional scoring systems, such as the Glasgow Coma Scale[18] first described in 1974, rely\nheavily on clinician\u2019s domain expertise. More data-driven methods for building scoring systems\nhave emerged in recent years, including the Supersparse Linear Integer Model[19] which can\nbetter deal with sparsity, approximal methods that are more computationally efficient[20], [21],\nand interfaces that enable flexible engagement of domain expertise, like the Interval Coded\nScoring[22] and the AutoScore[23].\nRegardless of development strategies, scoring systems have usually been created using single-\nsource data, limiting application at other sites if the development data has insufficient sample\nsize or is not representative. Although it is possible to develop scoring systems on pooled\ndata[24], the process of doing such pooling, as noted previously, is time consuming and difficult\nto achieve due to privacy restrictions. As a result, frameworks for building scoring systems in a\nfederated manner are needed to overcome such difficulties. To fill this gap, we propose FedScore,\na first-of-its-kind framework for building federated scoring systems across multiple sites and\ndemonstrated its efficacy and potential generalizability with a proof-of-concept experiment using\nreal-world data."

They can also assist in correcting physicians\u2019 misestimations of the probability of\nmedical outcomes, which may be rather common[28]. Users frequently take into account a\nmodel\u2019s degree of parsimony when implementing clinical models[29], which means that a model\nis parsimonious if it is both sparse (i.e., it uses the least amount of variables possible) and has\ngood prediction accuracy[29]. As an example, the AutoScore framework[23] is a computational\ntool to conveniently create such scores using machine learning methods, and has been well\nreceived by clinicians[30], [31], because it integrates domain knowledge with data driven\nevidence. However, regardless of the particulars of their generation of scoring systems and\naccounting for model interpretability, AutoScore and other similar methods only permit the\ndevelopment of scoring systems using one set of pooled data. To fully exploit the growing data\nsources and to create less biased models, we propose our FedScore framework to achieve good\nparsimony and interpretability for federated data, while complying with potential privacy\nrestrictions."

In FedScore, variable ranking is first\nperformed independently via random forests at each local site, and then a global variable ranking\nis created by rearranging variables by their weighted ranks across all \ud835\udc3e sites. Specifically, for a\nsingle variable \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc5a where 1 \u2264 \ud835\udc5a \u2264 \ud835\udc43 and \ud835\udc43 is the total number of predictors, let \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc57 \u2208 \ud835\udc41 denote\nits rank at site \ud835\udc57, then its global ranking is obtained by mapping all values of \u2211 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc3e \ud835\udc57=1 \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc57 for each\nsite to the integer set [1, \ud835\udc43] \u2282 \ud835\udc4d.

The maximum number of categories for such\ntransformation is pre-determined (for example, choose 5 as a usual practice), and if the\nmaximum is surpassed, categories are combined so that the requirement is met.

            "text": "FedScore is among the first frameworks that aims to generalize unified scores across multiple\nsites while preserving privacy. The scalable and adaptable architecture offers potential solutions\nfor improving model generalizability and stability across isolated clinical datasets.\nWhereas scoring systems have been widely utilized in clinical domains, few existing FL\napplications have focused on them despite their prevalence, reflecting the phenomenon that\nexisting biomedical FL applications have a tendency to favor black box models[46] over more\ninterpretable ML models. To meet physicians' expectations for model simplicity and\ntransparency, FL applications of interpretable models require more customization and\nmodification compared to black box model implementations with well-established FL\nframeworks available from the computer science community. A simple and straightforward\nscoring table with a lower AUC value for risk stratification, for example, would be preferred by\nclinicians over a black box model with a higher AUC value in the ED. As a result, more cautious\ndesigns for FL applications of interpretable models are required and FedScore deals with this\nissue by emphasizing model parsimony and enabling flexible process monitoring for users.\nFuture FL applications in clinical sciences should take similar factors into account if the research\nquestions favor transparent solutions rather than merely being concerned with model\nperformance.\nFL studies in the biomedical field differ from the ones in computer science, albeit sharing similar\norigins. In many standard engineering FL contexts, since a single client cannot create models\nindependently, attention has been paid to technical details such as data partitioning schemes and\nvarious privacy mechanisms[47]. In clinical domains however, data are frequently formed at the\nhospital or institution level, making local models feasible in these cases. Under these\ncircumstances, generalizability (models\u2019 ability to generalize their performance to a new\nsetting[48]) and stability of global models relative to local models become more crucial, but\nthese factors are not sufficiently considered in many existing FL frameworks that are being\ndeveloped. The results in section 3 show that by a co-training process via FL, a global model\nprediction framework such as FedScore can achieve less variation than locally developed ones\nwhile still maintaining good performance. This benefit of FL is promising for medical research\nthat seeks dependable high risk decision making.\nData constraints, such as biased data and small datasets are considered a source of ML\nmisuse[49], yet investigating such misconduct is not as feasible as developing models. Despite\nthe emphasis[48] on external validations, less than 10% of clinical prediction studies reported to\nhave done so[50]. Instead of training a model on single site and subsequently testing and\nmodifying it on other sites, constructing a model with sufficient and representative data through\nprivacy-preserving means may be a more viable solution. FedScore and its future extensions\ncould potentially aid in reducing model inconsistency across cohorts, leading to more\ntrustworthy decision-making for medical research.\nAlthough we have only used one binary outcome example for illustration, our FedScore\nframework is scalable and versatile, given that modules could be appropriately modified to\naccommodate different clinical research questions. For instance, the score derivation module\ncould be modified to accommodate survival or ordinal outcomes, and additional privacy-\npreserving FL frameworks and topologies might also be added to offer more options. We\nanticipate that FedScore and its future extensions could together act as some foundations for\ncreating more trustworthy clinical scoring systems in approaches that safeguard data privacy."

FedScore may encounter problems with heterogeneous medical\ndata because the current ODAL2 algorithm in module 3 requires that the data across different\nsites are homogeneous, similar to the majority of the FL and distributed methods currently in\nuse[12], [51]. However, since the proposed framework is scalable, it can be continuously\nupdated and enhanced by cutting-edge solutions that can better deal with the issue. Future work\nwill involve international collaboration to develop the FedScore process with more\nheterogeneous datasets. We plan to extend the FedScore by incorporating the two state-of-art FL\nalgorithms that account for the between-site heterogeneity. The first strategy is to use the dCLR\nalgorithm[52], motivated from a novel pairwise conditional logistic regression, to estimate the\ncommon regression coefficients and then estimate the site-specific intercept locally for each site.\nThe second strategy is to adopt the lossless, few-shot dPQL algorithm[53], which has been used\nto rank the performance of different hospitals while considering the case-mix situation across\nsites (i.e., different hospitals are treating different patients)."

While demonstrated for binary\noutcomes, the application of FedScore can be extended for settings with other types of clinical\noutcomes and greater heterogeneity across sites with future developments in FL and clinical\nprediction methods, enabling its use in a wide range of different medical contexts.\nTable 1 Description of the study cohortsa (N = 80613)\nAll Sites Site 1 Site 2 Site 3 Site 4 Site 5 Site 6 Site 7 Site 8 Site 9 Site 10\n# Episodes 80,613 3,224 4,031 5,643 7,255 8,061 8,867 9,674 10,480 11,286 12,092 Age, mean (SD) 63.51 (17.74) 64.09 (17.35) 63.54 (17.77) 63.32 (17.78) 63.80 (17.70) 63.38 (17.70) 63.24 (18.08) 63.52 (17.72) 63.59 (17.76) 63.29 (17.67) 63.65 (17.68) Gender Female 40492 (50.2) 1599 (49.6) 2015 (50.0) 2830 (50.2) 3604 (49.7) 4034 (50.0) 4528 (51.1) 4899 (50.6) 5258 (50.2) 5705 (50.5) 6020 (49.8) Male 40121 (49.8) 1625 (50.4) 2016 (50.0) 2813 (49.8) 3651 (50.3) 4027 (50.0) 4339 (48.9) 4775 (49.4) 5222 (49.8) 5581 (49.5) 6072 (50.2) Race/ethnicity Chinese 56966 (70.7) 2289 (71.0) 2847 (70.6) 3956 (70.1) 5125 (70.6) 5763 (71.5) 6273 (70.7) 6769 (70.0) 7358 (70.2) 7941 (70.4) 8645 (71.5) Indian 8888 (11.0) 320 (9.9) 452 (11.2) 610 (10.8) 811 (11.2) 819 (10.2) 1026 (11.6) 1120 (11.6) 1171 (11.2) 1266 (11.2) 1293 (10.7) Malay 9793 (12.1) 386 (12.0) 478 (11.9) 711 (12.6) 865 (11.9) 1006 (12.5) 1026 (11.6) 1203 (12.4) 1308 (12.5) 1368 (12.1) 1442 (11.9) Others 4966 (6.2) 229 (7.1) 254 (6.3) 366 (6.5) 454 (6.3) 473 (5.9) 542 (6.1) 582 (6.0) 643 (6.1) 711 (6.3) 712 (5.9) PACS triage categories P1 19169 (23.8) 778 (24.1) 950 (23.6) 1279 (22.7) 1752 (24.1) 1865 (23.1) 2095 (23.6) 2311 (23.9) 2579 (24.6) 2665 (23.6) 2895 (23.9) P2 44572 (55.3) 1800 (55.8) 2210 (54.8) 3166 (56.1) 3989 (55.0) 4547 (56.4) 4852 (54.7) 5275 (54.5) 5762 (55.0) 6286 (55.7) 6685 (55.3) P3 and P4 16872 (20.9) 646 (20.0) 871 (21.6) 1198 (21.2) 1514 (20.9) 1649 (20.5) 1920 (21.7) 2088 (21.6) 2139 (20.4) 2335 (20.7) 2512 (20.8) Shift time 8 AM to 4 PM 42594 (52.8) 1707 (52.9) 2133 (52.9) 3012 (53.4) 3851 (53.1) 4275 (53.0) 4649 (52.4) 5158 (53.3) 5609 (53.5) 5893 (52.2) 6307 (52.2) 4 PM to midnight 28141 (34.9) 1115 (34.6) 1419 (35.2) 1937 (34.3) 2537 (35.0) 2829 (35.1) 3112 (35.1) 3378 (34.9) 3584 (34.2) 3961 (35.1) 4269 (35.3) Midnight to 8 AM 9878 (12.3) 402 (12.5) 479 (11.9) 694 (12.3) 867 (12.0) 957 (11.9) 1106 (12.5) 1138 (11.8) 1287 (12.3) 1432 (12.7) 1516 (12.5) Day of week Friday 11060 (13.7) 445 (13.8) 555 (13.8) 763 (13.5) 983 (13.5) 1088 (13.5) 1234 (13.9) 1313 (13.6) 1388 (13.2) 1620 (14.4) 1671 (13.8) Midweek 35464 (44.0) 1435 (44.5) 1781 (44.2) 2590 (45.9) 3178 (43.8) 3614 (44.8) 3880 (43.8) 4272 (44.2) 4588 (43.8) 4820 (42.7) 5306 (43.9) Monday 13311 (16.5) 528 (16.4) 640 (15.9) 905 (16.0) 1200 (16.5) 1306 (16.2) 1486 (16.8) 1610 (16.6) 1756 (16.8) 1897 (16.8) 1983 (16.4) Weekend 20778 (25.8) 816 (25.3) 1055 (26.2) 1385 (24.5) 1894 (26.1) 2053 (25.5) 2267 (25.6) 2479 (25.6) 2748 (26.2) 2949 (26.1) 3132 (25.9) Vital Signs, mean (SD) Pulse, /min 86.38 (18.41) 86.14 (18.75) 86.68 (18.26) 85.89 (18.03) 86.39 (18.58) 86.26 (18.34) 86.51 (18.59) 86.49 (18.56) 86.65 (18.38) 86.36 (18.21) 86.27 (18.42) Respiration, /min 18.27 (2.16) 18.26 (2.16) 18.31 (2.18) 18.22 (2.05) 18.28 (2.21) 18.22 (2.11) 18.28 (2.19) 18.25 (2.14) 18.30 (2.14) 18.27 (2.18) 18.27 (2.22) SpO2, % 97.37 (4.11) 97.40 (3.66) 97.37 (4.42) 97.25 (4.93) 97.28 (4.50) 97.34 (4.03) 97.43 (3.83) 97.40 (3.95) 97.40 (3.85) 97.42 (3.65) 97.32 (4.45) Blood pressure, mm Hg Diastolic 72.58 (14.06) 72.62 (14.07) 72.32 (13.78) 72.70 (13.71) 72.78 (14.09) 72.67 (14.14) 72.63 (14.20) 72.54 (14.25) 72.62 (14.18) 72.54 (14.07) 72.44 (13.87) Systolic 137.46 (27.98) 137.95 (28.34) 136.91 (27.23) 137.56 (27.78) 137.64 (27.98) 137.73 (28.14) 137.12 (27.72) 137.45 (28.36) 137.79 (28.36) 137.48 (27.93) 137.13 (27.70) Comorbidities Myocardial infarction 5095 (6.3) 207 (6.4) 262 (6.5) 335 (5.9) 462 (6.4) 512 (6.4) 540 (6.1) 621 (6.4) 666 (6.4) 699 (6.2) 791 (6.5) Congestive heart failure 8841 (11.0) 363 (11.3) 453 (11.2) 600 (10.6) 767 (10.6) 901 (11.2) 956 (10.8) 1044 (10.8) 1212 (11.6) 1214 (10.8) 1331 (11.0) Peripheral vascular disease 4649 (5.8) 181 (5.6) 219 (5.4) 298 (5.3) 429 (5.9) 479 (5.9) 522 (5.9) 528 (5.5) 654 (6.2) 631 (5.6) 708 (5.9) Stroke 9527 (11.8) 400 (12.4) 498 (12.4) 653 (11.6) 838 (11.6) 969 (12.0) 1055 (11.9) 1141 (11.8) 1260 (12.0) 1307 (11.6) 1406 (11.6)\nAbbreviations: HD, high-dependency;
