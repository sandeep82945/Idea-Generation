1. **Investigate the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions tailored to specific CW sectors.** 
Current research suggests that online interventions should be industry responsive and acknowledge the unique experiences of CWs. Future studies could explore the development and evaluation of digital mental health interventions that are specifically tailored to the needs of CWs in different sectors, such as corrections, law enforcement, and firefighting.


2. **Examine the impact of digital mental health interventions on CW job performance and workplace culture.** 
While research has shown that digital mental health interventions can improve mental health outcomes in CWs, there is a need for more research to examine the impact of these interventions on job performance and workplace culture. Future studies could investigate whether digital mental health interventions can lead to improved job satisfaction, reduced absenteeism, and a more positive work environment.


3. **Explore the role of digital mental health interventions in preventing mental health problems in CWs.** 
Most of the research on digital mental health interventions for CWs has focused on reactive interventions, such as e-CBT, which are designed to treat existing mental health problems. Future studies could explore the potential of digital mental health interventions to prevent mental health problems in CWs by promoting resilience, coping skills, and well-being.


4. **Investigate the long-term effectiveness of digital mental health interventions for CWs.** 
The majority of studies on digital mental health interventions for CWs have been short-term, with follow-up periods of less than 12 months. Future studies could investigate the long-term effectiveness of these interventions to determine whether the benefits are sustained over time.


5. **Develop and evaluate digital mental health interventions that integrate proactive and reactive components.** 
As discussed in the paper, there is a need for digital mental health interventions that can address the spectrum of mental health needs in CWs, from prevention to treatment. Future studies could develop and evaluate digital mental health interventions that integrate proactive and reactive components to provide a comprehensive approach to mental health care for CWs.
