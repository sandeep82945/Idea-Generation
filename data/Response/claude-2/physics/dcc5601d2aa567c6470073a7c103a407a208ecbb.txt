 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Isolate and identify the specific bioactive compounds responsible for the cytotoxic effects against colon cancer cells. Further study their mechanisms of action. 

2. Investigate the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of the extracts in animal models of colitis to determine if they could be an effective natural treatment.

3. Explore the effects of the extracts on other cancer cell lines beyond colon cancer, such as breast, lung, etc. to determine their potential as anti-cancer agents.

4. Conduct clinical studies in humans to evaluate the extracts' efficacy and safety for conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease.

5. Study the synergistic effects of combining different extracts or isolated compounds from P. quercetorum to enhance therapeutic effects. Also explore effects of combinations with standard drugs.
