    "abstractText": "In this work, two Schiff-base-based chemosensors L1 and L2 containing electron-rich quinoline and anthracene rings were designed. L1 is AIEE active in a MeOH-H2O solvent system while formed aggregates as confirmed by the DLS measurements and fluorescence lifetime studies. The chemosensor L1 was used for the sensitive, selective, and reversible \u2018turn-on\u2019 detection of Al3+ and Ga3+ ions as well as Aspartic Acid (Asp). Chemosensor L2, an isomer of L1, was able to selectively detect Ga3+ ion even in the presence of Al3+ ions and thus was able to discriminate between the two ions. The binding mode of chemosensors with analytes was substantiated through a combination of 1H NMR spectra, mass spectra, and DFT studies. The \u2018turn-on\u2019 nature of fluorescence sensing by the two chemosensors enabled the development of colorimetric detection, filter-paper-based test strips, and polystyrene film-based detection techniques.",

            "text": "Earth\u2019s crust consists of various metals, out of which aluminum is the third most abundant [1,2]. Aluminum metal and its compounds enter into the environment through various anthropogenic activities such as building materials, transportation, electronics, industrial effluents, wastewater treatment plants, utensils, and food additives [3\u20136]. As a result, aluminum gets absorbed and accumulated in the human body due to its excessive exposure [6\u20138]. Although aluminum is a nonessential metal in the human body, once inside, it competes with other important metals with similar properties (e.g., Mg2+, Ca2+, and Fe3+ ions) to bind to various proteins [9\u201312]. The high concentration of aluminum in humans can cause severe neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson\u2019s diseases along with various other diseases including microcytic hypochromic anemia, dialysis encephalopathy, and Al-related bone disease [1,13\u201315]. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), the permissible limit of aluminum ions in drinking water is 7.4 \u00b5M while the daily average intake should not exceed 3\u201310 mg [15\u201317]. Therefore, efforts have been made to develop efficient sensors that can detect aluminum ion (Al3+) selectively and sensitively [10]. Similarly, gallium ions (Ga3+), belonging to the identical IIIA group as Al3+, have also been recognized as a potential risk to human health [4,18\u201320]. Amino acids, as building blocks, are essential for living organisms for various vital functions [21\u201323]. Amongst all nonessential amino acids, Aspartic Acid (Asp) plays several critical roles in various biological and physiological processes [24\u201326]. Asp is specifically required for its role in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle [27,28]. Asp also serves as the main precursor for the synthesis of two amino acids, i.e., Glutamic acid and Glycine [24,29]. Asp acts as a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system [24,30]. Studies have shown the use of K+Asp as a cure for heart and liver diseases and diabetes, but a higher amount of Asp can also cause Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, and it is also connected\nSensors 2023, 23, 1798. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23041798 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 1798 2 of 20\nwith the early onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease [25,27,30]. Therefore, the selective and sensitive detection of Asp is quite essential. The literature presents a number of chemosensors that can detect both Al3+ and Ga3+ ions, but only a few chemosensors are known for the discriminative detection of Al3+ and Ga3+ ions [31]. Similarly, a very limited number of examples are available where a chemosensor can detect Al3+ and Ga3+ ions as well as Asp [31]. Many chemosensors suffer from the Aggregation Caused Quenching (ACQ) at higher concentrations [32,33]. Hence, anti-ACQ materials, also known as the Aggregation-Induced Enhanced Emission (AIEE) materials have generated a lot of interest due to their unique light-emitting properties [34,35]. Such AIEE-active fluorophores are usually nonemissive or poorly emissive at the lower concentration but are brightly emissive at the higher concentration or in the aggregated state [36,37]. Moreover, AIEE-active chemosensors offer the advantages of low background noise and a large Stokes shift [35,38]. Thus, the development of rapid, low-cost, and AIEE-active chemosensors that can selectively and sensitively detect Al3+ and Ga3+ ions as well as Asp is of utmost importance [39\u201341]. In this work, we present two isomeric quinoline- and anthracene-based Schiff bases L1 and L2 as the \u2018turn-on\u2019 fluorescent chemosensors. L1 displays the AIEE properties in a MeOH-H2O system while also acting as a sensitive, selective, and fluorescent chemosensor for the detection of Al3+ and Ga3+ ions and Asp. In contrast, L2, a positional isomer of L1, was exclusively selective for the Ga3+ ion and can be used as a discriminative tool for the detection of Ga3+ ion even in the presence of Al3+ ion. The sensing abilities of L1 were further utilized to fabricate low-cost detection methods for both Al3+ and Ga3+ ions and Asp. It is important to note that very few reports are available in the literature where an AIEE active chemosensor can detect Al3+ and Ga3+ ions and Asp [31]."

Becke\u2019s three parameter exchange correlation functional by Lee, Yang, and Parr (B3LYP) was utilized as a hybrid functional for the calculations using Gaussian09W suits [48]. Two different basis sets were used for the geometrical optimization: viz., LANL2DZ for the Al3+ and Ga3+ ions and 6-311 + G (d, p) for the rest of the atoms [49,50].

            "text": "Both L1 and L2 were soluble in various polar and nonpolar solvents such as MeOH, EtOH, THF, CHCl3, DCM, DMF, and DMSO but were insoluble in water. Therefore, in order to induce AIEE, the optical properties of L1 and L2 were examined in MeOH (c, 50 \u00b5M) after adding different percentages of water (fw = 0 to 95%). In fluorescence spectra, as the percentage of water (fw, %) increased from 0 to 60 in a MeOH solution of L1, the emission intensity increased constantly at 411 nm and attained a maxima at this wavelength (Figure 1a). This enhancement is attributed to the aggregation of L1 [32,38]. Notably, as the water percentage was further increased to 70%, a significant bathochromic shift to 460 nm (\u2206\u03bb = 50 nm) was observed. Furthermore, when the water percentage was further increased, the emission intensity decreased but without any shift in wavelength. At fw = 95%, the emission bands were distributed equally at both wavelengths. We believe as the hydrophobic anthracene rings repel water, they minimize their contact with water and thus rupture the aggregates beyond a water percentage of 70% [62,63]. Figure 1b displays changes at various percentages of water varying from 10% to 95% in a MeOH-H2O system under UV light. Notably, the emission spectrum of L2 did not display any change with different percentages of water and hence L2 was AIEE inactive (Figure S15) [32]. In the case of L1, aggregate formation was confirmed by the dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies (Figure 2). DLS measurements revealed that the average diameter of the aggregates increased from 118 nm at fw = 10% to 610 nm at fw = 70%. However, at fw = 95%, the size of aggregates decreased to 293 nm. These results thus confirm that not only does L1 form aggregates in the presence of water, but maximum aggregation was possible at fw = 70%. Sensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 21\nFigure 1.

Since lifetime measurements are independent of the excitation wavelength and concentration, such studies are more conclusive [64]. The fluorescence lifetime (\u03c4av) increased from 3.38 ns at fw = 0 % to 5.73 ns at fw = 70%, implying the aggregate formation (Figure S16 and Table S2). However, \u03c4av decreased to 4.47 ns at fw = 95%, further confirming that the maximum aggregation was possible at fw = 70%. To obtain further support, the fluorescence quantum yield (\u03a6F) was calculated for L1. The quantum yield was very low (\u03a6F = 0.008) at fw = 0%; however, it increased nearly four-fold at fw = 70% (\u03a6F = 0.031). As expected, \u03a6F again decreased to 0.023 at fw = 95%, confirming the formation of maximum aggregates only at fw = 70%. For L1, both the low quantum yield and lifetime at fw = 0% suggested the operation of Photoinduced Electron Transfer (PET) from imine-N and phenolic-OR (R: -CH2-) to the quinoline and anthracene moieties, respectively (Scheme 2). In addition, the intramolecular rotation of the imine-C bond further quenched the emission intensity via nonradiative decay at fw = 0%.

In contrast, L2 displayed an enhanced emission at 430 nm only in the presence of Ga3+ ions while no change was noted with the Al3+ ion as well as other metal ions [6]. Therefore, the chemosensor L2 was able to discriminate between the Al3+ and Ga3+ ions. The bar diagram nicely illustrates the change in the emission intensity of L1 and L2 after the addition of different metal ions (Figure 4c).

It is, therefore, evident that both L1 and L2 were highly selective for Al3+/Ga3+ ions even in the presence of assorted metal ions.\nThe excitation energy of a chemosensor may change after its interaction with an analyte. Hence, the excited state behavior of L1 and L2 in the absence and presence of Al3+/Ga3+ ions was evaluated through the lifetime measurements [70]. L1 exhibited a biexponential decay with an average lifetime (\u03c4av) of 3.38 ns. In the presence of Al3+ and Ga3+ ions, \u03c4av increased to 14.12 and 13.62 ns, respectively (Figures 7a and S19, and Table S2). A similar four-fold enhancement in \u03c4av of L1 in the presence of Al3+ and Ga3+ ions suggested that both these ions offered a similar mode of interaction with L1. However, L2 displayed a triexponential decay with \u03c4av of 0.77 ns, which increased 1.5-fold times to 1.17 ns in the presence of Ga3+ ions (Figure 7b). The quantum yields of L1 and L2 were also measured in the absence and presence of Al3+/ Ga3+ ions by taking Quinine sulfate (\u03a6F = 0.54) as a reference [55]. The resultant \u03a6F for L1, L1\u2212Al3+, and L1\u2212Ga3+ were found to be 0.008, 0.065, and 0.062, respectively. Thus, enhancement in the quantum yield was approximately eight-fold both for the Al3+ and Ga3+ ions. The calculated \u03a6F for L2\u2212Ga3+ (0.010) displayed a 2.5-fold enhancement when compared to L2 (0.003). These results further support the fluorescence lifetime studies.

Both chemosensors L1 and L2 offer three types of functional groups: phenolic-OR (R = -CH2- or -CH3), imine-N, and quinoline-N. Both Al3+ and Ga3+ ions are hard acids and are thus likely to interact and/or bind preferentially with the phenolic-OR followed by imine-N [4,14]. For positional isomers L1 and L2, the position of the quinoline-N is likely to play a crucial role. In the case of L1, the binding of a metal ion through phenolic-OR (R = -CH2-), imine-N, and quinoline-N results in the formation of both six- and five-membered chelate rings and supports chelation-enhanced fluorescence. It is important to mention that a metal ion (Al3+/Ga3+) is situated significantly above (approx. 2.7\u20132.8 \u00c5) the plane of L1 to facilitate the simultaneous coordination of phenolic-OR, imineN, and quinoline groups, as depicted by the DFT studies (vide infra). Due to the formation of such chelate rings, L1 achieves structural rigidity while the intramolecular bond rotation of the imine-N group becomes restricted (Scheme 3). At the same time, excited-state electron transfer from imine-N and phenolic-OR to quinoline rings and anthracenyl moieties also gets inhibited. Collectively, these points suppress the PET [72,73]. Moreover, as PET is subdued, the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) takes place between the anthracene and quinoline rings [2]. Therefore, as a result of the turning off of the PET process and turning-on of CHEF and FRET, the emission intensity of L1 increases in the presence of Al3+/Ga3+ ions.\nSensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 21\nThe absorption and emission spectral studies confirmed the interaction and/or binding of Al3+/Ga3+ ions to L1 and L2.

Sensing mechanism of L1 towards Al3+/Ga3+ ions via fluorescence \u2018turn-on\u2019 strategy.\nAll studies pointed to a similar mode of binding of both Al3+ and Ga3+ ions with L1. To further confirm the binding mode of L1, an 1H NMR spectral titration with Al3+ ions was performed (Figures 9 and S20). When sequentially adding one equivalent of Al3+ ions to a solution of L1, imine-N, phenolic-OR (R = -CH2-), and quinoline-N were shifted downfield, confirming their involvement in binding to the Al3+ ion. Moreover, the quinoline ring protons also shifted downfield, thus further confirming their role in binding. Importantly, both -CH2- and -CH3 protons were completely resolved, indicating a difference in their chemical environment after the binding of the Al3+ ion. Further, anthracene ring protons were also perturbed after the potential coordination of an Al3+ ion. Notably, various aromatic protons were found to split to give multiplets. We propose that imine-N, phenolic-OR, and quinoline-N form a pocket in which a metal ion nicely resides. Such a binding mode affects the chemical environment of nearby arene rings and hence multiplets were observed [4]. In L2, the position of quinoline-N was changed, which is now anti to the imine-N group. As a result, the formation of a common binding pocket was not possible. It is therefore proposed that a larger Ga3+ ion is able to interact with both phenolic-OR (R = -CH2-, - CH3) groups and imine-N. As the Al3+ ion is smaller in size, it could not interact with all three groups, and hence L2 did not show its recognition. The enhanced emission was observed due to the suppression of PET and \u2018turn-on\u2019 of CHEF. As the quinoline ring was not involved in binding to a Ga3+ ion, FRET was not operative [74,75].

To characterize the actual species formed between L1 and Al3+/Ga3+ ions, ESI+ mass spectra were recorded. The mass spectra of L1Al3+ species displayed a peak at m/z 673.27 which corresponded to [L1 + Al3+ + 2NO3\u2014 + OCH3\u2014 + Na+]+. On the other hand, L1Ga3+ species showed a peak at m/z 669.30 corresponding to [L1 + Ga3+ + 3OCH3\u2013 + K+]+ (Figures S22 and S23). The sources of the NO3\u2013 and OCH3\u2013 ions were from an aluminum precursor, Al(NO3)3, and a CH3OH solvent, respectively. It is important to note that, for both species, the isotopic distribution patterns nicely matched that of the simulated patterns. The mass spectra further asserted a 1:1 metal binding stoichiometry to L1 [58]. The said binding stoichiometry was further confirmed by Job\u2019s plot for both Al3+ and Ga3+ ions (Figure S24) [59].\nFigure 9.

DFT Studies All chemical structures were optimized by the DFT using the suitable basis sets and functional (see Table S4 for the Cartesian coordinates). The molecular electrostatic potential surface (MESP) maps are often employed for the qualitative investigation of the charge distribution in a system. Hence, the optimized structures of chemosensors L1 and L2 were used to study the electropositive and electronegative centers. As shown in Figure 10, the electrostatic potential was scaled between \u221247.0 and +32.0 kcal/mol for both L1 and L2 with their approximate values marked. Notably, both oxygen and nitrogen centers in L1 and L2 were relatively more electronegative as depicted from the red-colored region around them. The MESP maps therefore suggest that the metal ions can bind with these groups: quoniline-N, imine-N, and phenolic-OR (-CH2-).\n0 eq. Al3+\n0.5 eq. Al3+\n1 eq. Al3+\na b c\nab c\nFigure 9.

The enhanced emission was observed due to the suppression of PET and \u2018turn-on\u2019 of CHEF. As the quinoline ring was not involved in binding to a Ga3+ ion, FRET was not operative [74,75]. This proposition was further confirmed by the 1H NMR spectral studies where protons of both phenolic-OR and imine-N displayed a downfield shift whereas both quinoline and anthracene rings remained unaffected (Figure S21). To characterize the actual species formed between L1 and Al3+/Ga3+ ions, ESI+ mass spectra were recorded. The mass spectra of L1\u2212Al3+ species displayed a peak at m/z 673.27 which corresponded to [L1 + Al3+ + 2NO3\u2014 + OCH3\u2014 + Na+]+. On the other hand, L1\u2212Ga3+ species showed a peak at m/z 669.30 corresponding to [L1 + Ga3+ + 3OCH3\u2212 + K+]+ (Figures S22 and S23). The sources of the NO3\u2212 and OCH3\u2212 ions were from an aluminum precursor, Al(NO3)3, and a CH3OH solvent, respectively. It is important to note that, for both species, the isotopic distribution patterns nicely matched that of the simulated patterns. The mass spectra further asserted a 1:1 metal binding stoichiometry to L1 [58]. The said binding stoichiometry was further confirmed by Job\u2019s plot for both Al3+ and Ga3+ ions (Figure S24) [59]."

All studies were conducted in EtOH.\nTo identify the binding sites, an 1H NMR spectrum of L1 was recorded in the presence of 1 eq. of Asp. The imine-N and phenolic-OR (R = -CH2- and -CH3) protons displayed a downfield shift (Figure S29). Notably, a small downfield shift in the quinoline ring protons was also noted, suggesting that the quinoline-N was interacting with Asp. Such an interaction aligns with both L1 and Asp to maximize their interaction. However, the aromatic ring protons, i.e., anthracene and arene, remained unaffected. These results suggest that imine-N, both phenolic-OR groups, and quinoline-N are the potential interacting sites of L1 towards a molecule of Asp [29]. We propose that due to such interactions, PET in L1 was suppressed, resulting in an enhanced emission. Importantly, Asp was not recognized by L2 because of the fact that the quinoline-N group was farthest located, which did not allow it to interact with Asp to achieve the correct conformation and hence its sensing was not observed.\n3.11. Low-Cost Detection Methods The \u2018turn-on\u2019 detection of Al3+ and Ga3+ ions by both chemosensors prompted us to attempt different low-cost detection methods. As the best sensing results were observed for L1, low-cost detection methods were explored using the chemosensor L1 (Figure 14). The colorimetric detection was attempted by introducing different metals (c, 2.5 mM) and amino acids (c, 2.5 mM) to an EtOH solution of L1. Notably, L1 displayed detectable enhanced emission under UV light (\u03bbex = 365 nm) with both Al3+ and Ga3+ ions and Asp when compared to other metals and amino acids [79]. Next, polystyrene films were prepared containing the chemosensor L1 [4]. Such peelable polystyrene films displayed enhanced emission under UV light for the detection of both Al3+ and Ga3+ ions as well as Asp from their aqueous solutions. Similarly, filter paper test strips containing L1 were able to detect both Al3+ and Ga3+ ions (c, 2.5 mM) and Asp (c, 2.5 mM) from the aqueous solutions of different metal ions and amino acids [56]. Importantly, such filter paper test strips, tested with different concentrations of Al3+ ions (0, 5, 20, and 50 \u03bcM), were able to detect concentrations as low as 5 \u03bcM by showing color change from blue to cyan under the UV lamp (Figure S30). Hence, low-cost detection methods can be utilized to detect both Al3+ and Ga3+ ions as well as Asp for practical on-site detections.\nFigure 13.
