    "abstractText": "In this work, a new photovoltaic device was prepared. The device uses titanium (Ti) foil/TiO2 nanotubes as the photoanode and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as a photosensitizer. Titanium dioxide nanotube arrays (TiO2-NTs) were prepared by one-step anodic oxidation. Cut-MWCNTs with a length of less than 100 nm were obtained by the mixed-acid oxidation of MWCNTs. The two materials were combined to form a TiO2-NTs@cut-MWCNT heterostructure by electrophoresis. TiO2-NTs@cut-MWCNTs were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), which showed that the two materials were effectively combined. We fabricated the heterostructure into a photovoltaic device, showing an enhanced photocurrent response and an efficiency of 0.0138%, and explained this phenomenon by performing UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and electrochemical tests. It is hoped that this work can provide a reference value for the application of carbon nanotubes in photovoltaic devices.",

            "text": "Solar energy is renewable energy with the advantages of wide distribution, easy access, and inexhaustible supply. As an effective way to utilize solar energy, solar cells have always been a research hotspot [1]. Silicon-based solar cells are the most mature at present, but they are expensive, consume lots of energy in the production process, and have a long cost recovery period, which are all barriers to their large-scale application and promotion. In 1986, Dr. C.W. Tang [2] first prepared a double-layer organic solar cell device with copper titanate cyanine as the donor material and perylene as the acceptor material and tested it under simulated sunlight to obtain an efficiency of 1%. In 1991, O\u2019Regan and Gr\u00e4tzel [3] manufactured the first nanocrystalline TiO2 chemical solar cell. Compared with traditional solar cells, this cell has the advantages of a simple manufacturing process, low production cost, and non-toxic and pollution-free production, and it is expected to compete with silicon technology in the future [4]. In contrast, the light-absorbing layer materials of dye-sensitized solar cells and polymer solar cells need to undergo complex organic synthesis, and their stability is not high. Therefore, researchers have been exploring new materials, new processes, and new structures. TiO2 is an excellent candidate semiconductor material for the effective use of solar energy because of its appropriate band gap, low cost, good chemical stability, and photostability. Since Grimes et al. [5] first reported the successful preparation of highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiO2-NTs) by electrochemical anodization, the synthesis and application of one-dimensional tubular array structures represented by TiO2-NTs have increased\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3604. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12203604 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3604 2 of 12\nrapidly. This structural material has a high orientation, can provide a good path for electron transfer, and is simple to manufacture. Its preparation avoids the cumbersome process of organic synthesis, provides the possibility for large-scale roll-to-roll production, and is proven to have great application value in photovoltaic devices [6\u201311]. Although TiO2 has high photoactivity among many oxide semiconductors, its ability to use sunlight is still very limited, and the recombination rate of photogenerated charges is high, resulting in low quantum yield. Therefore, a lot of work has been conducted to develop modifications of TiO2. Carbon nanotubes are cheap and easy to obtain by chemical treatment. Their energy-level position and band-gap width can be changed to match the energy level of TiO2. They can therefore be used as a photosensitizer \u201cdye\u201d. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are composed of multiple single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). The density of states of each single-walled carbon nanotube has Van Hove singularity and exhibits a photovoltaic effect. Therefore, they have attracted great attention in the field of photoelectrochemistry [12\u201319]. Kumar and colleagues [20] used TiO2 and MWCNTs as active charge-generating layers by spin-coating them on transparent conductive substrates to fabricate solar cells. The efficiency of the TiO2@MWCNT solar cell was 0.4%. Kalitag et al. [21] embedded cut MWCNTs into polymer films to improve their performance and found that cut MWCNTs have better hole transport ability. Baker et al. [22] reviewed carbon solar cells, which use carbon nanotubes as the photosensitive layer with semiconductor properties. In this work, we propose an all-titanium\u2013carbon photovoltaic device. TiO2-NTs were first prepared by anodization, cut-MWCNTs were prepared by mixed-acid oxidation, and then the two materials were combined to form a TiO2-NTs@cut-MWCNT heterostructure by a simple electrophoresis method [23]. Although the heterostructure formed by the composite of TiO2 and carbon nanotubes has been applied in the field of photocatalysis, its functional mechanism for light energy conversion has not yet been reported [24\u201326], and there is no example of fabricating photovoltaic devices using only TiO2 and carbon nanotubes. Therefore, we prepared an all-titanium\u2013carbon photovoltaic device based on the TiO2-NTs@cut-MWCNT heterostructure. The charge-transfer mechanism in the device was studied by electrochemical tests. Most importantly, the material cost of the photovoltaic device is low, and the experimental method is simple. We hope this work can provide some reference value for the application of carbon nanotubes in photovoltaic devices."

            "text": "MWCNTs often contain high-density pentagonal and heptagonal defects on the sidewalls of the nanotubes [28]. During the mixed-acid oxidation process, these positions will be preferentially destroyed. Figure 2a,b show the TEM and FESEM images of MWCNTs, respectively. It can be seen that the length of MWCNTs is so long that the tubes are entangled with each other, and the average diameter of the MWCNTs is calculated to be 14.72 \u00b1 0.55 nm (counted number: 500). Figure 2d,e show the TEM and FESEM images of cut-MWCNTs, respectively. It can be seen that the length of cut-MWCNTs becomes shorter, and the dispersibility becomes better. Due to the uneven distribution of defects on the surface of carbon nanotubes, the length distribution of cut-MWCNTs is uneven, the average length of cut-MWCNTs is 58.86 \u00b1 0.52 nm (counted number: 500), and the average diameter is 17.02 \u00b1 0.14 nm (counted number: 500). This is because, during the oxidation process, the walls of the carbon nanotubes are destroyed. By comparison, it can be concluded that the ratio of the length to the diameter of cut-MWCNTs is significantly smaller than that of MWCNTs. The Raman spectra provide molecular vibration and rotation information. Through the analysis of the position and intensity of the characteristic peaks in the spectrum of MWCNTs and cut-MWCNTs, changes in the composition and structure can be discerned. Figure 2g shows the Raman spectra of MWCNTs and cut-MWCNTs. The spectra of MWCNTs and cut-MWCNTs contain D and G peaks. The D peak at 1345 cm\u22121 is related to the structural defects of MWCNTs, carbon nanoparticles adsorbed on the tube wall, amorphous carbon, and other factors, which are generally considered to be caused by the defects of MWCNTs. The G peak at 1592 cm\u22121 is due to the sp2 hybridization of carbon atoms. The ratio of the D peak to the G peak, R, is used to characterize the structure of carbon nanotubes. The R value of MWCNTs is 1.01, and the cut-MWCNTs have an increased R of 1.26, indicating that part of the ordered graphene structure was destroyed by the acid treatment used for cutting [29]. Mixed-acid treatment will introduce acidic groups to the surface of the carbon nanotubes [30]. Cut-MWCNTs were analyzed by infrared spectroscopy, and the types of functional groups were determined according to the positions of absorption peaks. Figure 2h shows the infrared spectra of MWCNTs and cut-MWCNTs. Compared with MWCNTs, cut-MWCNTs have a wide peak at 3500\u20132000 cm\u22121, which is caused by the stretching vibration of -OH, meaning that acid treatment can introduce -OH to the surface of cutMWCNTs. The peak at 1707 cm\u22121 is associated with the C=O stretching of carboxylic acids. The absorption peak near 1580 cm\u22121 corresponds to the stretching vibration of the C=C bond, which is inherent in the structure of carbon nanotubes. The peaks at 1404 cm\u22121 and 1100 cm\u22121 are obviously enhanced, corresponding to the in-plane bending vibration of -CH and the stretching vibration of C-O, respectively. These absorption peaks indicate that there are a large number of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of cut-MWCNTs, which increase the negative surface charge and enhance the electrostatic repulsion between cut-MWCNTs. The strong electrostatic repulsion makes the dispersion of carbon nanotubes in solution more uniform and prevents aggregation. This is consistent with the TEM and FESEM results and is conducive to the deposition of cut-MWCNTs on the surface of TiO2-NTs by electrophoresis.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3604 5 of 12Nanomaterials 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 12\nFigure 2.

Through\nthe analysis of the position and intensity of the characteristic peaks in the spectrum of\nMWCNTs and cut-MWCNTs, changes in the composition and structure can be discerned.\nFigure 2g shows the Raman spectra of MWCNTs and cut-MWCNTs. The spectra of\nMWCNTs and cut-MWCNTs contain D and G peaks. The D peak at 1345 cm\u22121 is related\nto the structural defects of MWCNTs, carbon nanoparticles adsorbed on the tube wall,\namorphous carbon, and other factors, which are generally considered to be caused by the\ndefects of MWCNTs. The G peak at 1592 cm\u22121 is due to the sp2 hybridization of carbon\natoms. The ratio of the D peak to the G peak, R, is used to characterize the structure of\ncarbon nanotubes. The R value of MWCNTs is 1.01, and the cut-MWCNTs have an in-\ncreased R of 1.26, indicating that part of the ordered graphene structure was destroyed by\nthe acid treatment used for cutting [29].\nMixed-acid treatment will introduce acidic groups to the surface of the carbon\nnanotubes [30]. Cut-MWCNTs were analyzed by infrared spectroscopy, and the types of\nfunctional groups were determined according to the positions of absorption peaks. Fig-\nure 2h shows the infrared spectra of MWCNTs and cut-MWCNTs. Compared with\nFigure 2.

As shown Figure 2i, the peak at 26.1\u25e6 is the diffraction pe k of the graphitic layer structure (002), from which the crystalline structural changes in carbon nanotubes before and after cutting can be seen. The peak of pristine MWCNTs is sharper and stronger. However, the peak of cut-MWCNTs at 26.1\u25e6 is broader and much lower, and the intensity drops significantly, indicating that the initial graphitic structure of MWCNTs is oxidized and has more amorphous features. A large number of oxygen-containing functional groups change the atomic arrangement of MWCNTs. The surface properties of MWCNTs and cut-MWCNTs were studied by N2 adsorption analysis. As can be seen from the nitrogen (N2) adsorption\u2013desorption isotherm in Figure S2a, the samples have obvious lag loops at relative pressures between 0.7 and 1.0, indicating the existence of mesopores. The carbon nanotubes show an increase in the surface area from 105 m2/g to 155 m2/g due to oxidative cutting. The increase in the specific surface area can\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3604 6 of 12\nbe attributed to the combined effect of the unbundling of MWCNTs and the opening of end caps, leading to a higher uptake of nitrogen at a relative pressure of 0.7 to 1.0 in the cut-MWCNTs due to the increase in mesopores [31], while the length of cut-MWCNTs is shorter and can achieve better contact with TiO2-NTs. In addition, the slight N2 uptake at low pressures suggests the co-existence of micropores. The NL-DFT pore size distribution further verifies the pore structure, showing that the main pores are centered in a wide range of 1\u201310 nm (Figure S2b). It is interesting to find that there is a new fraction of pores at 3.4 nm for cut-MWCNTs, suggesting that pickling is beneficial to the formation of mesopores. To further study the chemical bonding of MWCNTs in the oxidized state, we carried out XPS characterization of the MWCNTs and cut-MWCNTs. The spectra of C1s before and after oxidation (Figure 2c,f) can be divided into four peaks. The peak areas corresponding to C-O and C=O increased significantly after oxidation. Table 1 lists the elemental composition of MWCNTs and cut-MWCNTs, also showing a significant increase in the oxygen atom percentage after oxidation. MWCNTs can be regarded as coiled multilayer graphene. Mixed-acid oxidation consumes \u03c0-conjugated groups and introduces oxygen-containing functional groups between graphite layers [32], which is consistent with the FT-IR results. In addition, the contents of N and S are also increased slightly, but the remaining N and S functional groups have no mobility after the strong and repeated washing process, so they have no influence on the device efficiency."

The average inner diameter is 32.27 \u00b1 0.24 nm, and the tube lengths are about 600~700 nm. Figure 3c,d are SEM images of TiO2-NTs@cut-MWCNTs, in which the deposited cut-MWCNTs can be found in the pores and gaps among the TiO2-NTs, as marked in Figure 3d (Figure S3 is a cross-sectional SEM image of the TiO2-NTs@cutMWCNT heterostructure). To demonstrate the effect of cut-MWCNTs on the light absorption properties of TiO2-NTs, Figure 3e shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of TiO2-NTs and TiO2-NTs@cutMWCNTs. Compared with TiO2-NTs, the light absorption of the TiO2-NTs@cut-MWCNT heterostructure significantly increased, and at the same time, its absorption edge was redshifted from 310 nm to 336 nm, indicating that due to the recombination of cut-MWCNTs, the energy band of TiO2-NTs is narrower and is more readily excited by visible light. XRD was employed to characterize the crystalline phase of the TiO2-NTs@cut-MWCNT heterostructure, as shown in Figure 3f. Before the annealing of TiO2-NTs, all peaks were attributed to the Ti substrate. After annealing, peaks appeared at 25.1\u25e6 and 48\u25e6, corresponding to the (101) and (200) crystal planes of the anatase phase of TiO2, indicating that annealing changed the crystal form of TiO2 from the amorphous phase to the anatase phase. Anatase TiO2 is a relatively stable structure with high band-gap energy. There are more defects and vacancies in the lattice, resulting in more oxygen vacancies to capture electrons, so it has high activity. In the XRD patterns of the TiO2-NTs@cut-MWCNT heterostructure, the (101) plane (2\u03b8 = 25.1\u25e6) of the anatase phase can be seen. However, there are almost no diffraction peaks to be found for cut-MWCNTs. This is because the cut-MWCNTs have a broad and weak diffraction peak at 2\u03b8 = 26.1\u25e6, as shown in Figure 2i, indicating very weak crystalline characteristics. Thus, in the TiO2-NTs@cut-MWCNTs, the lower content of cut-MWCNTs results in a signal that is too weak to detect.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3604 7 of 12\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 12"

            "text": "In conclusion, we prepared highly ordered TiO2-NTs on a metal Ti substrate by anodic oxidation. Short cut-MWCNTs were obtained by chemical oxidation. The tests and analyses showed that the graphene structure of MWCNTs was destroyed, and a large number of negatively charged oxygen-containing functional groups were introduced to the surface. Under the action of an external electric field, cut-MWCNTs were filled into TiO2-NTs to form the TiO2-NTs@cut-MWCNT heterostructure. The test results show that the two materials effectively combined. Chemically modified MWCNTs have a band gap of 2.2 eV and have a suitable energy level matching that of TiO2. Compared with pure TiO2-NTs, the TiO2-NTs@cut-MWCNT heterostructure exhibits higher light absorption and a higher transient photocurrent density, and the fabricated photovoltaic device efficiency increases from 0.01036% to 0.01380%. This is a new attempt to adjust the band gap of carbon nanotubes through oxidation to achieve energy level matching with TiO2 and to prepare photovoltaic devices with semiconducting carbon nanotubes as photosensitizers. We hope this study provides a reference for the application of carbon nanotubes in photovoltaic devices and promotes the further development for the efficient large-scale production of all-titanium\u2013carbon photovoltaic devices.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/nano12203604/s1, Figure S1: Schematic diagram of the electrophoresis device; Figure S2: (a) N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms; (b) NL-DFT pore size distributions of MWCNTs and cut-MWCNTs; Figure S3: Cross-sectional SEM image of the TiO2-NTs@cutMWCNTs heterostructure; Figure S4: Kubelka-Munk function for band gap estimation of TiO2-NTs.\nAuthor Contributions: S.N.: data curation, formal analysis, writing\u2014original draft preparation, and writing\u2014review and editing.
