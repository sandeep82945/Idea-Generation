    "abstractText": "We design a Mixed Virtual Element Method for the approximated solution to the first-order form of the acoustic wave equation. In absence of external load, the semi-discrete method exactly conserves the system energy. To integrate in time the semi-discrete problem we consider a classical \u03b8 -method scheme. We carry out the stability and convergence analysis in the energy norm for the semi-discrete problem showing optimal rate of convergence with respect to the mesh size. We further study the property of energy conservation for the fully-discrete system. Finally, we present some verification tests as well as engineering application of the method.",

We carry out the stability and convergence analysis in the energy norm for the semi-discrete problem showing optimal rate of convergence with respect to the mesh size. We further study the property of energy conservation for the fully-discrete system.

            "text": "The numerical simulation of acoustic, elastic or electromagnetic wave propagation finds application in many scientific disciplines, including aerospace, geophysics, civil engineering, telecommunications, and medicine for instance.\nThe present work considers a Mixed Virtual Element method on general polytopal grids for the discretization of the acoustic wave equation written as a first order system of hyperbolic partial differential equations.\nIn general, mixed methods consider the discretization of vector fields in some H(div)-conforming spaces while scalar fields in some L2 spaces. Classes of mixed methods include the well known RaviartThomas (RT) [9, 58, 61], the Brezzi-Douglas-Marini (BDM) [26, 30, 31, 56] finite element schemes and more recently the Mixed Virtual Element Methods (MVEM) [15, 39]. The VEM, introduced firstly in [14], have been applied recently to various differential problems, including elasticity [10], Stokes [20, 33], Navier-Stokes [21], Cahn-Hilliard [2], Darcy [39], Helmholtz [53], Maxwell [18] and wave [4, 40, 62] equations.\nThe major benefit of using VEM, instead of classical approaches, is the fact that it gives the opportunity to preserve at the discrete level some important properties valid at the continuous level. In particular, it is possible to design discrete spaces with global high regularity, which preserve the\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n11 60\n3v 1\n[ m\nat h.\nN A\n] 2\n3 Se\np 20\n22\npolynomial divergence/curl, that are robust with respect to mesh-locking phenomena. Moreover, VEM can handle general polytopal meshes, that are particularly useful to account for small features in the model (such as cracks, holes and inclusions), and treat in an automatic way hanging nodes, movable meshes and adaptivity.\nThe very first analysis of RT finite element discretization applied for the spatial approximation of the acoustic wave equation is presented by Geveci in [46]. He showed that even if the RT finite elements conserve the energy of the system, when a time discretization is applied, the fully-discrete method produces an implicit time-marching scheme which is inefficient, since the mass matrix is nondiagonal. For this reason it is preferred to use mass lumping techniques, see e.g. [13, 37] or symplectic schemes that conserve a positive-definite perturbed energy functional [52]. A slightly different formulation, in which two time derivatives appear on the vector variable and none on the other equation has been analysed in literature, see, for instance, [34, 38, 49, 50, 51].\nDiscontinuous Galerkin (dG) methods have been also considered for the solution of the wave equation in the mixed form, see for instance [11, 34, 35, 36, 55]. However, they have been mostly studied for the second order hyperbolic version: we mention [48, 60] for the scalar case, [5, 8, 42, 43, 44, 54, 59] for the vectorial case and [3, 6, 7] where a dG approximation on polygonal grids is considered. Within the framework of polytopal methods we mention a recent work by [32] where the Hybrid High-Order (HHO) method is applied to the wave equation in either first and second order form and [19] where the Mimetic Finite Differences is applied in the context of Hamiltonian wave equations.\nHere, for the first time, a MVEM is considered for the solution of linear wave acoustics written as a system of first order partial differential equations. The analysis is carried out by taking inspiration from the approaches proposed in [17, 22] and [39]. Concerning the choice of the degrees of freedom, the proposed scheme can be seen as the extension on polytopal grids of RT finite elements. The integration in time of the semi-discrte problem is achieved by considering a \u03b8 -method scheme.\nThe paper is organised as follows: in Section 2 we review the mathematical model, its weak formulation, a stability result and the energy conservation of the system. In Section 3 after introducing the virtual element spaces with the associated set of degrees of freedom and defining the discrete bilinear forms, we present the semi-discrete virtual element formulation and establish the well-posedness of the semi-discrete problem, the stability bound for discrete solution in a discrete energy norm and the energy conservation. In Section 4 we analyse the theoretical properties of the proposed method: by considering the Fortin operator introduced in [39], we recall the interpolation estimates. Then, we prove optimal order of convergence for the proposed method. Moreover we estimate the error between the energy of the exact solution and the energy of the virtual element solution. In Section 5 we introduce the family of \u03b8 -method schemes for integrating in time the semidiscrete problem in Section 3.4 and discuss the property of energy conservation. In Section 6 we provide some experiments to give numerical evidence of the behaviour of the proposed scheme. Finally, Section 7 is devoted to conclusions and future perspectives.\nNotations and Preliminaries\nThroughout the paper we will follow the usual notation for Sobolev spaces and norms as in [1]. Let \u2126 \u2282R2 be the computational domain with Lipschitz continuous boundary \u2202\u2126 and external unit normal n, we denote with x = (x1, x2) the independent variable. With a usual notation the symbols \u2207 and curl denote the gradient and curl for scalar functions, while div denotes the divergence operator for vector fields. For an open bounded domain \u03c9 , the norm in the space Lp(\u03c9) is denoted by \u2016\u00b7\u2016Lp(\u03c9), norm and seminorm in Hs(\u03c9) are denoted respectively by \u2016\u00b7\u2016s,\u03c9 and |\u00b7|s,\u03c9 , while (\u00b7, \u00b7)\u03c9 and \u2016 \u00b7 \u20160,\u03c9 denote the\nL2-inner product and the L2-norm (the subscript \u03c9 may be omitted when \u03c9 is the whole computational domain \u2126 ).\nWe recall the following well known functional spaces which will be useful in the sequel\nH(div,\u03c9) := {v \u2208 [L2(\u03c9)]2 : divv \u2208 L2(\u03c9)} ,\nH(curl,\u03c9) := {v \u2208 [L2(\u03c9)]2 : curlv \u2208 L2(\u03c9)} ,\nand introduce the following spaces\nV := {v \u2208 H(div,\u2126) s.t. v \u00b7n = 0 on \u0393N} , Q := L2(\u2126) ,\nwhere \u0393N \u2282 \u2202\u2126 , equipped with natural inner products and induced norms. Since we are dealing with a time dependent problem, we will also consider the following Bochner spaces. Let T > 0, for space-time functions v(x, t) defined on \u03c9\u00d7(0,T ), we denote with vt the derivative with respect to the time variable. Furthermore, using standard notations [57], for a Banach space V with norm \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016V , we introduce the space\nL2(0,T ;V ) := { v : (0,T )\u2192V s.t. v measurable, \u222b T\n0 \u2016v(t)\u20162V dt <+\u221e\n} .\nIn similar way, for n\u2265 0, we consider the space Cn(0,T ;V )."

            "text": "In this Section we describe the virtual element discretization of Problem 2 on general polygonal meshes. In particular, in Section 3.1 we introduce the assumptions on the regularity of the polygonal meshes together with the definition of crucial projector operators that will be fundamental in the construction of the VE discretization. In Section 3.2 we describe the H(div)-conforming VE spaces, whereas in\nSection 3.3 we present the discrete forms. Finally, in Section 3.4 we introduce the semi-discrete VE discretization of Problem 2 and we provide the stability bound of the solution and the energy preserving property of the semi-discrete system.\n3.1. Mesh assumptions and polynomial projections\nFrom now on, we will denote by E a general polygon having `E edges e. For each polygon E and each edge e of E we denote by |E|, hE the measure and diameter of E respectively, by he we denote the length of e. Furthermore neE (resp. nE) denotes the unit outward normal vector to e (resp. to \u2202E).\nLet {\u2126h}h be a sequence of decompositions of \u2126 into general polygons E, where the granularity h is defined as h = supE\u2208\u2126h hE . We suppose that {\u2126h}h fulfills the following assumption: (A1) Mesh assumption. There exists a positive constant \u03c1 such that for any E \u2208 {\u2126h}h\n\u2022 Any E \u2208 {\u2126h}h is star-shaped with respect to a ball BE of radius \u2265 \u03c1 hE ; \u2022 Any edge e of any E \u2208 {\u2126h}h, he \u2265 \u03c1 hE .\nWe remark that the hypotheses above, though not too restrictive in many practical cases, could possibly be further relaxed, combining the present analysis with the studies in [23, 24, 28].\nReferring to Problem 2, we assume that for any h the decomposition \u2126h matches with the subdivision of \u2202\u2126 into \u0393D, \u0393N , \u0393R and with the definition of the piece-wise constant velocity c. We denote by \u03a3h the set of all the mesh edges and, for any E \u2208\u2126h, we define \u03a3 Eh the set of the edges of E. The total number of vertexes, edges and elements in the decomposition \u2126h are denoted by LV , Le and LP, respectively.\nUsing standard VE notations, for any mesh object \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126h \u222a\u03a3h and for any n \u2208 N let us introduce the space Pn(\u03c9) to be the space of polynomials defined on \u03c9 of degree \u2264 n, with the extended notation P\u22121(\u03c9) = {0}. For any n \u2208 N and for any non-negative s \u2208 R we consider the broken spaces\n\u2022 Pn(\u2126h) = {q \u2208 L2(\u2126) s.t. q|E \u2208 Pn(E) for all E \u2208\u2126h}, \u2022 Hs(\u2126h) = {v \u2208 L2(\u2126) s.t. v|E \u2208 Hs(E) for all E \u2208\u2126h},\nequipped with the broken norm and seminorm\n\u2016v\u20162Hs(\u2126h) = \u2211 E\u2208\u2126h \u2016v\u20162Hs(E) , |v| 2 Hs(\u2126h) = \u2211 E\u2208\u2126h |v|2Hs(E) .\nFor any E \u2208\u2126h, let us introduce the L2-projection \u03a0 0,En : L2(E)\u2192 Pn(E), given by\u222b E qn(v\u2212 \u03a0 0,En v)dE = 0 for all v \u2208 L2(E) and qn \u2208 Pn(E),\nwith obvious extension for vector functions \u03a0 0,En : [L2(E)]2 \u2192 [Pn(E)]2. The global counterpart \u03a0 0n : L2(\u2126h)\u2192 Pn(\u2126h), is defined for all E \u2208\u2126h by\n(\u03a0 0n v)|E = \u03a0 0,En v . (3.1)\nIn the following the symbol . will denote a bound up to a generic positive constant, independent of the mesh size h and of the time step \u03c4 introduced in Section 5, but which may depend on \u2126 , on the \u201cpolynomial\u201d order k and on the regularity constant appearing in the mesh Assumption (A1).\n3.2. Virtual Element spaces\nWe start by presenting an overview of the H(div)-conforming Virtual Element space, cf. [15, 16, 39]. Let k \u2265 0 be the \u201cpolynomial\u201d order of the method. We thus consider on each polygonal element E \u2208\u2126h the virtual space\nV k(E) = { v \u2208 H(div,E)\u2229H(curl,E) s.t. (i) divv \u2208 Pk(E) ,\n(ii) curlv \u2208 Pk\u22121(E) , (iii) (v \u00b7neE)|e \u2208 Pk(e) \u2200e \u2208 \u03a3 Eh } .\nIn the following, we summarize the main properties of the space V k(E). We refer to [15, 16, 39] for a detailed analysis.\n(P1) Polynomial inclusion: Pk(E)\u2286V k(E); (P2) Degrees of freedom: the following linear operators DV constitute a set of DoFs for V k(E): for any\nw \u2208V k(E) we consider\nDV1 the element moments of the divergence\u222b E (divw) pk dE \u2200pk \u2208 Pk(E)\\R, DV2 the element moments \u222b E w \u00b7 (pk\u22121x\u22a5)dE \u2200pk \u2208 Pk\u22121,\nwhere x\u22a5 := (y,\u2212x)T; DV3 the edge moments \u222b\ne (w \u00b7neE) pk de \u2200pk \u2208 Pk(e), \u2200e \u2208 \u03a3 Eh .\nTherefore the dimension of V k(E) is\ndim(V k(E)) = `E (k+1)+ k2 +2k .\n(P3) Computable quantities: for any w \u2208V k(E) the DoFs DV allow to compute\n\u03a0 0,Ek w , divw , (w \u00b7n e E)|e \u2200e \u2208 \u03a3 Eh .\nThe global virtual element space V k is defined by gluing together all local spaces, that is: we require that for any internal edge e \u2208 \u03a3 Eh \u2229\u03a3 E \u2032 h , shared by E and E \u2032,\nw|E \u00b7neE +w|E \u2032 \u00b7neE \u2032 = 0 \u2200w \u2208V k,\nthat is in accordance with the DoFs definition DV1. Therefore we have\nV k := {v \u2208V s.t. v|E \u2208V k(E) \u2200E \u2208\u2126h}. (3.2)\nThe dimension of V k is thus given by\ndim(V k) = (k+1)Le +(k2 +2k)LP .\nThe discrete pressure space Qk is given by the piecewise polynomial functions of degree k, i.e.\nQk := Pk(\u2126h) . (3.3)\n3.3. Virtual Element forms\nThe next step in the construction of our method is the definition of a discrete version of the continuous forms in (2.2). Following the usual procedure in the VE setting, we need to construct discrete forms that are computable through the DoFs. Notice that in the light of property (P3), for any vh,wh \u2208V k and qh, ph \u2208 Qk the quantities\nn(ph,qh) , b(vh,qh) , r(vh,wh) , F(qh)\nare computable. Whereas for arbitrary functions in V k the form m(\u00b7, \u00b7) is not computable since the discrete functions are not known in closed form. Employing property (P3) for any vh, wh \u2208 V k(E) we define the computable local discrete bilinear form:\nmEh (vh,wh) := \u222b\nE (\u03a0 0,Ek vh) \u00b7 (\u03a0 0,E k wh)dE +h \u22122 E S E(vh,wh) . (3.4)\nThe stabilizing term in (3.4) is given by\nS E(vh,wh) = SE ( (I\u2212\u03a0 0,Ek )vh, (I\u2212\u03a0 0,E k )wh ) ,\nwhere SE(\u00b7, \u00b7) : V k(E)\u00d7V k(E)\u2192 R is a computable symmetric discrete form. In the present paper we consider the so-called dofi-dofi stabilization [14] defined as follows: let~vh and ~wh denote the real valued vectors containing the values of the local degrees of freedom (properly scaled) associated to vh, wh in the space V k(E) then\nSE(vh,wh) =~vh \u00b7~wh .\nUnder mesh Assumption (A1) the form SE(\u00b7, \u00b7) satisfies the following bounds (we refer to [39] for the details)\n\u2016vh\u201620,E . h2ESE(vh,vh). \u2016vh\u201620,E , (3.5)\nfor all vh \u2208V k(E)\u2229ker(\u03a0 0,Ek ). The global form mh(\u00b7, \u00b7) : (V k\u222a [Pk(\u2126h)]2)\u00d7 (V k\u222a [Pk(\u2126h)]2)\u2192R can be derived adding the local contributions mh(vh,wh) := \u2211\nE\u2208\u2126h mEh (vh,wh) \u2200(vh,wh) \u2208 (V k \u222a [Pk(\u2126h)]2) . (3.6)\nNotice that, from (3.4) and (3.5), it follows that\nmh(pk,vh) = m(pk,vh) \u2200pk \u2208 [Pk(\u2126h)]2 ,vh \u2208 (V k \u222a [Pk(\u2126h)]2) , (3.7)\n\u2016vh\u201620,\u2126 . mh(vh,vh). \u2016vh\u201620,\u2126 \u2200vh \u2208 (V k \u222a [Pk(\u2126h)]2) . (3.8)\n3.4. Virtual Element semi-discrete problem\nReferring to the spaces (3.2) and (3.3), the forms (2.2) and the discrete bilinear form (3.6), we can state the following semi-discrete problem.\nProblem 3 (VEM problem) Find uh \u2208 L2(0,T ;V k) \u2229 C0(0,T ;Q2), and ph \u2208 L2(0,T ;Qk) \u2229 C0(0,T ;Qk) s.t. {\nmh(uht ,vh)+b(vh, ph)+ r(uh,vh) = 0 \u2200vh \u2208V k, n(pht ,qh)\u2212b(uh,qh) = F(qh) \u2200qh \u2208 Qk,\nwith initial condition uh(\u00b7,0) = \u03a0 0k u0 and ph(\u00b7,0) = \u03a0 0k p0 in \u2126 .\nThe well-posedness of Problem 3 follows from:\n\u2022 discrete inf-sup condition [16]: there exists \u03b2\u0302 > 0 s.t.\ninf qh\u2208Qk sup vh\u2208V k b(vh,qh) \u2016vh\u2016V \u2016qh\u2016Q \u2265 \u03b2\u0302 .\n\u2022 coercivity on the discrete kernel: the bilinear form mh(\u00b7, \u00b7) satisfies\nmh(vh,vh)& \u2016vh\u20162V \u2200vh \u2208 K k ,\nwhere K k := {vh \u2208V k s.t. b(vh,qh) = 0 \u2200qh \u2208 Qk}.\nLet us introduce the discrete energy norm\n\u2016(vh,qh)\u20162Eh := mh(vh,vh)+\u2016c \u22121qh\u201620,\u2126 \u2200 (vh,qh) \u2208 (V k \u222a [Pk(\u2126h)]2)\u00d7Qk . (3.9)\nThen, using analogous argument to that used for the continuous case, the discrete solution (uh, ph) of Problem 3 satisfies the following stability estimate\nsup 0\u2264t\u2264T\n\u2016(uh, ph)(t)\u2016Eh \u2264 \u222b T\n0 \u2016c f (s)\u20160,\u2126 ds+\u2016(\u03a0 0 k u0,\u03a0 0 k p0)\u2016E ,\nwhere, from (3.7), we have used that\n\u2016(pk,qh)\u2016Eh = \u2016(pk,qh)\u2016E \u2200(pk,qh) \u2208 [Pk(\u2126h)] 2\u00d7Qk .\nFurthermore if f = 0 and \u0393R = /0, Problem 3 is energy conservative, i.e. the solution (uh, ph) of Problem 3 satisfies\n\u2016(uh, ph)(t)\u2016Eh = \u2016(\u03a0 0 k u0,\u03a0 0 k p0)\u2016E \u2200t \u2208 [0,T ] , (3.10)\nthat is the semi-discrete counterpart of (2.4).\nRemark 1 Notice that definitions (2.3) and (3.9) and bounds (3.8) imply the following norm equivalence\n\u2016(vh,qh)\u2016E . \u2016(vh,qh)\u2016Eh . \u2016(vh,qh)\u2016E \u2200 (vh,qh) \u2208V k\u00d7Qk . (3.11)\nRemark 2 The proposed approach can be easily extended to more general situations such as the three dimensional case [15], and domains with curved boundary/interfaces [39, 41]. The analysis could be developed with very similar arguments to the ones in the forthcoming sections."

Energy error\nAn important aspect in wave propagation problems is the energy conservation of the continuous and semi-discrete system (cf. (2.4) and (3.10) rispectively). In the following proposition we estimate the errors between the energy of the continuous and the semi-discrete energy of the system.\nProposition 4.3 Under assuption (A1), let (u, p) be the solution of Problem 2 and (uh, ph) be the solution of Problem 3 with f = 0 and \u0393R = /0. Assume that u0, p0 \u2208 Hk+1(\u2126h). Then for all t \u2208 (0,T ), the following estimate holds:\n0\u2264 \u2016(u, p)(t)\u20162E \u2212\u2016(uh, ph)(t)\u20162Eh . h 2(k+1)(|u0|2k+1,\u2126h + c\u03022 |p0|2k+1,\u2126h) ,\nwhere c\u0302 := \u2016c\u22121\u2016L\u221e(\u2126\u00d7(0,T )).\nProof . From (2.4) and (3.10) we infer\n\u2016(u, p)(t)\u20162E \u2212\u2016(uh, ph)(t)\u20162Eh = \u2016(u0, p0)\u2016 2 E \u2212\u2016(\u03a0 0k u0,\u03a0 0k p0)\u20162E\n= \u2016u0\u201620,\u2126 +\u2016c\u22121 p0\u201620,\u2126 \u2212\u2016\u03a0 0ku0\u201620,\u2126 \u2212\u2016c\u22121\u03a0 0k p0\u201620,\u2126 .\nDirect application of Pythagorean Theorem yields\n\u2016\u03b6\u201620,\u2126 = \u2016\u03a0 0k \u03b6\u201620,\u2126 +\u2016\u03b6 \u2212\u03a0 0k \u03b6\u201620,\u2126 , \u2200\u03b6 \u2208 L2(\u2126) ,\ntherefore, recalling that c is piece-wise constant w.r.t. \u2126h, we infer\n\u2016(u, p)(t)\u20162E \u2212\u2016(uh, ph)(t)\u20162Eh = \u2016u0\u2212\u03a0 0 k u0\u201620,\u2126 +\u2016c\u22121(p0\u2212\u03a0 0k p0)\u201620,\u2126 .

Therefore, we introduce a sequence of time steps tn = n\u03c4 , n = 0, . . . ,N, with time step size \u03c4 . Next, we define vnh,\u03c4 := vh(\u00b7, tn) (resp. qnh,\u03c4 := qh(\u00b7, tn)) as the approximation of the function vh(\u00b7, t) \u2208V k (resp. qh(\u00b7, t) \u2208Qk ) at time tn, n = 0, . . . ,N. To integrate in time Problem 3, we take under consideration the family of \u03b8 -method schemes and analyse their energy conservation properties. The fully discrete systems consequently reads as follows: Given (u0h,\u03c4 , p 0 h,\u03c4) = (\u03a0 0 k u0,\u03a0 0 k p0), find (u n h,\u03c4 , p\nn h,\u03c4) for n = 0, . . . ,N s.t. mh ( un+1h,\u03c4 \u2212u n h,\u03c4 \u03c4 ,vh ) +b(vh,\u03b8 pn+1h,\u03c4 +(1\u2212\u03b8)p n h,\u03c4)+ r(\u03b8u n+1 h,\u03c4 +(1\u2212\u03b8)u n h,\u03c4 ,vh) = 0 \u2200vh \u2208V k, n ( pn+1h,\u03c4 \u2212 p n h,\u03c4\n\u03c4 ,qh\n) \u2212b(\u03b8un+1h,\u03c4 +(1\u2212\u03b8)u n h,\u03c4 ,qh) = \u03b8F n+1(qh)+(1\u2212\u03b8)Fn(qh) \u2200qh \u2208 Qk,\n(5.1)\nwhere Fn(qh) := ( f (tn),qh)\u2126 and \u03b8 \u2208 [0,1].

Thus, the above system reduces to mh ( un+1h,\u03c4 \u2212u n h,\u03c4 \u03c4 ,vh ) +b(vh,\u03b8 pn+1h,\u03c4 +(1\u2212\u03b8)p n h,\u03c4) = 0 \u2200vh \u2208V k, n ( pn+1h,\u03c4 \u2212 p n h,\u03c4\n\u03c4 ,qh\n) \u2212b(\u03b8un+1h,\u03c4 +(1\u2212\u03b8)u n h,\u03c4 ,qh) = 0 \u2200qh \u2208 Qk .\n(5.2)\nWe start by considering in (5.2)\nvh = \u03b8un+1h,\u03c4 +(1\u2212\u03b8)u n h,\u03c4 \u2208V k, and qh = \u03b8 pn+1h,\u03c4 +(1\u2212\u03b8)p n h,\u03c4 \u2208 Qk,\nand by summing together the two above equation we get\nmh\n( un+1h,\u03c4 \u2212u n h,\u03c4\n\u03c4 ,\u03b8un+1h,\u03c4 +(1\u2212\u03b8)u n h,\u03c4\n) +n ( pn+1h,\u03c4 \u2212 p n h,\u03c4\n\u03c4 ,\u03b8 pn+1h,\u03c4 +(1\u2212\u03b8)p n h,\u03c4\n) = 0,\nthat is\n\u03b8\u2016(un+1h,\u03c4 , p n+1 h,\u03c4 )\u2016 2 Eh +(1\u22122\u03b8) ( mh(un+1h,\u03c4 ,u n h,\u03c4)+n(p n+1 h,\u03c4 , p n h,\u03c4) ) = (1\u2212\u03b8)\u2016(unh,\u03c4 , pnh,\u03c4)\u20162Eh ,\nwhich, rearranging the terms, is\n\u2016(un+1h,\u03c4 , p n+1 h,\u03c4 )\u2016 2 Eh +(2\u03b8 \u22121)\u2016(un+1h,\u03c4 \u2212u n h,\u03c4 , p n+1 h,\u03c4 \u2212 p n h,\u03c4)\u20162Eh = \u2016(u n h,\u03c4 , p n h,\u03c4)\u20162Eh .

            "text": "In this section we provide some numerical examples to show the behaviour of the method and give numerical evidence of the theoretical results derived in the previous sections. We consider three test cases: the first in Subsection 6.1 presents the expected convergence rates for different approximation degree over several mesh families. The second test case, given in Subsection 6.2, is focused on the energy conservation properties of the scheme. Finally, in Subsection 6.3, we consider a wave propagation problem in a domain having with small curved inclusions. The latter is handled by using the extension of VEM to curved edges (cf. Remark 2).\n6.1. Error decay\nIn this first test case, we verify the expected convergence rate of the method for different mesh families:\n\u2022 tria a simplicial mesh; \u2022 quad a Cartesian mesh; \u2022 hexa composed by distorched hexagons; \u2022 voro a mesh made of Voronoi cells optimized via a Lloyd algorithm.\nIn order to compute the VEM errors between the exact solution (u, p) and the VEM solution (uh, ph) at the final time T , we consider the computable L2-like error quantities,\neu := \u2016u(T )\u2212\u03a0 0k uh(T )\u20160,\u2126 and ep := \u2016p(T )\u2212\u03a0 0k ph(T )\u20160,\u2126 .\nLet us set the mesh-size parameter\nh := 1\nLP \u2211 E\u2208\u2126h hE .\nFor each family, we build a sequence of four meshes with decreasing mesh size h. In Figure 1 we depict one mesh as representative of each family.\nIn accordance with Proposition 4.2, the trend of each error indicator is computed and compared to the expected convergence trend. We consider a problem on \u2126 = (0,1)2 with analytical solution given by\nu(x, t) = [ \u22122\u03c0 cos(2\u03c0x)cos(2\u03c0y)sin(t)\n2\u03c0 sin(2\u03c0x)sin(2\u03c0y)sin(t)\n] ,\np(x, t) = cos(2\u03c0y)sin(2\u03c0x)cos(t).\nWe set \u0393D = \u2202\u2126 , \u0393N = \u0393R = /0 and choose c = 1. Boundary and initial conditions as well as the forcing term f in Problem 1 are computed accordingly. Since we are considering the space discretization error, we set T = 1.e\u22127 and \u03c4 = 1.e\u22128 with \u03b8 = 1 in (5.1).\nThe computed errors are given in Figure 2 and 3. Such convergence lines are coherent with the estimates derived in the theoretical results, see Proposition 4.2. For high approximation degree and fine mesh size, we notice stagnation of the error of the hexa and voro families. This is an expected behaviour discussed in [25]. A possible solution is to introduce a different basis for the polynomial expansion that makes the local systems better conditioned. However, this is out of the scope of the current work and it may be a good starting point for future investigations.\n2\u00d7 10\u22122 5\u00d7 10\u22122 10\u22121 h\n10\u22129\n10\u22127\n10\u22125\n10\u22123 10\u22121 er ro r\nO(h5)\nO(h4)\nO(h3)\nO(h2)\neu\n2\u00d7 10\u22122 5\u00d7 10\u22122 10\u22121 h\nO(h5)\nO(h4)\nO(h3)\nO(h2)\nephexa\n5\u00d7 10\u22122 10\u22121 2.5\u00d7 10\u22121 h\n10\u22127\n10\u22125\n10\u22123\n10\u22121\ner ro\nr\nO(h5)\nO(h4)\nO(h3)\nO(h2)\neu\n5\u00d7 10\u22122 10\u22121 2.5\u00d7 10\u22121 h\nO(h5)\nO(h4)\nO(h3)\nO(h2)\nepquad\n\u22120.04\n\u22120.02\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\nk = 1 k = 2 k = 3 k = 4\nFIG. 2. Error decay for different type of meshes. Example in Subsection 6.1.\n6.2. Conservation of energy\nIn this second example, we test the conservation of energy given, for the semi-discrete system, in (3.10). We consider the same mesh families and approximation degrees of the previous example and we choose four different time integration schemes: Explicit Euler, i.e. \u03b8 = 0 in (5.2), Implicit Euler, i.e. \u03b8 = 1 in (5.2) Crank-Nicolson, i.e. \u03b8 = 12 in (5.2), and Symplectic Euler (5.5). As observed in Section 3.4, the space discretization does locally conserve the energy so the possible lack of conservation will be due to the temporal scheme.\nThe spatial domain is still the unit square, \u0393D = [0,1]\u00d7{0,1} i.e. the top and the bottom boundaries, \u0393N = {0,1}\u00d7 [0,1] i.e. the left and right boundaries, and \u0393R = /0. The final time is T = 1 and \u03c4 = 1/200. We set to zero the source term, the characteristic velocity c = 1 and the initial velocity and pressure as\nu(x,0) = [\nsin(x) cos(y)\n] , and p(x,0) = cos(2\u03c0y)sin(2\u03c0x) .\nThe conservation of energy is depicted in Figure 4. In these graphs we compute the difference between the initial energy and the one at a specific time step and we report such values multiplied by a\n5\u00d7 10\u22122 1.25\u00d7 10\u22121 3.5\u00d7 10\u22121 h\n10\u22128\n10\u22126\n10\u22124\n10\u22122\n100\ner ro\nr\nO(h5)\nO(h4)\nO(h3)\nO(h2)\neu\n5\u00d7 10\u22122 1.25\u00d7 10\u22121 3.5\u00d7 10\u22121 h\nO(h5)\nO(h4)\nO(h3)\nO(h2)\neptria\n1.5\u00d7 10\u22122 5\u00d7 10\u22122 10\u22121 h\n10\u22129\n10\u22127\n10\u22125\n10\u22123\n10\u22121\ner ro\nr\nO(h5)\nO(h4)\nO(h3)\nO(h2)\neu\n1.5\u00d7 10\u22122 5\u00d7 10\u22122 10\u22121 h\nO(h5)\nO(h4)\nO(h3)\nO(h2)\nepvoro\n\u22120.04\n\u22120.02\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\nk = 1 k = 2 k = 3 k = 4\nFIG. 3. Error decay for different type of meshes. Example in Subsection 6.1.\nfactor of 104. We notice that for the Explicit Euler the energy tends to increase during time in agreement with (5.4). This trend becomes more evident for higher approximation degree. For the Implicit Euler the situation has an opposite behaviour. Indeed, the energy is now dissipated during time. Also for this scheme, higher approximation degrees tend to dissipate more energy. The semi-implicit Symplectic Euler scheme mitigates this effect: the energy is not conserved during time, but the absolute error does not grow and stay limited. Finally, Crank-Nicolson shows a perfect energy conservation property. To better appreciate this behaviour we report in Table 1 the values\nE = \u2016(uTh,\u03c4 , pTh,\u03c4)\u2016Eh \u2212\u2016(u 0 h,\u03c4 , p 0 h,\u03c4)\u2016Eh\n\u2016(u0h,\u03c4 , p0h,\u03c4)\u2016Eh , (6.1)\nbeing \u2016(uTh,\u03c4 , pTh,\u03c4)\u2016Eh the energy of the system at final time T . The behaviours of these time discretisation schemes perfectly match the arguments in Section 5."

Multiple scattering in curved configurations\nIn this example, we show the qualitative behaviour of the solution computed by the proposed approach in a domain with multiple circular inclusions. We consider two different configurations that are inspired by [12]. Both domain are defined in \u2126 = (0,1)2, but the first one has five holes whose centres are located at\nx1 = [a ,c]>, x2 = [a ,b]>, x3 = [a ,a]>, x4 = [b ,a]>, x5 = [c ,a]>,\nwhile the second one has three additional circles centred at\nx6 = [b ,c]>, x7 = [c ,c]>, x8 = [c ,b]>,\nwhere the values of the three parameters are given by\na = 0.6052631578947355 , b = 0.5, and c = 0.3947368421052622 .\nAll circles have diameter 0.02. We refer to the first and the second case as fiveHoles and eightHoles, respectively. The grid is build starting from a structured quadrilateral mesh, where the cells intersecting with a circle are properly cut. Moreover, since we exploit the possibility to include the geometry information within VEM spaces [39], we do not need to over-refine edges to get an accurate representation of the circles themselves. As a consequence, we can reduce the computational effort without losing the accuracy of the solution, by neglecting spurious waves due to a piece-wise linear representation of the circles.\nFor both fiveHoles and eightHoles examples, we build two meshes, see Figure 5. The first one starting from a square divided in 38\u00d738 uniform squares. Then, the second one is constructed by refining 2 times only the quadrilateral elements of the first one, see the detail in Figure 6.\nAlong the external boundaries of \u2126 , we impose absorbing boundary conditions, while on all the small circles perimeters we use homogeneous Neumann conditions. Then, we consider c = 1 and the following source term\nf (x, t) = 10.e\u2212(t\u22121) 2/\u03c31e\u2212\u2016x\u2212xc\u2016 2/\u03c32 ,\nwith \u03c31 = 0.01 and \u03c32 = 0.00125 and xc = [0.5,0.5]>. The initial values of both u and p are set to zero. We assume approximation degree equal to k = 2. As final time we take T = 10, we divide the interval [0,T ] into 50 equally spaced sub-intervals and we use the Crank-Nicolson time integration scheme.\nIn Figure 7 we show the computed pressure solution ph evaluated at quadrature points at different time steps for the fiveHoles case.

Energy error for different schemes. For visualization purposes the values have been magnified by a factor 104. Example in Subsection 6.2.\nones, we consider the fine mesh. From a qualitative point of view we observe no much difference between them.\nIn Figure 8 we consider the eightHoles case. Also for this experiment we observe that the coarser mesh provides similar results of the ones obtained with the refined mesh. Moreover, since the holes are displaced in a symmetric way with respect to xc we expect the waves preserve a symmetric structure. This is confirmed by the snapshots represented in Figure 8."

            "text": "In this work, we presented a general order virtual element numerical discretization scheme to approximate the wave equation written in mixed form. The latter results in a first order system of differential equations in both space and time dimension. We presented the a-priori stability analysis as well as the convergence property of the scheme in a suitable energy norm and we showed that the proposed virtual element scheme preserve the semi-discrete energy of the system in absence of external load. To integrate in time the semi-discrete problem we consider the family of the \u03b8 - method schemes and we discuss their energy conservation properties. We verified the theoretical results on different benchmark tests and we applied the proposed scheme on a domain with circular inclusions to show the capabilities of the method in term of accuracy and of flexibility in handling complex geometries. To conclude, the presented mixed virtual element method allows a robust and flexible numerical\ndiscretization that can be successfully applied to wave propagation problems. Future developments in this direction may include the study of multi-physics problems (written in a mixed form) such as vibro-acoustics (with elastic or poroelastic structure) interaction problems."
