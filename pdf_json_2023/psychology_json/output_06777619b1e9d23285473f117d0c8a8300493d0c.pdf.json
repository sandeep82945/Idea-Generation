    "abstractText": "10 Measuring the chemical traits of leaf litter is important for understanding plants\u2019 roles in nutrient cycles, 11 including through nutrient resorption and litter decomposition, but conventional leaf trait measurements 12 are often destructive and labor-intensive. Here, we develop and evaluate the performance of partial least13 squares regression (PLSR) models that use reflectance spectra of intact or ground leaves to estimate leaf 14 litter traits, including carbon and nitrogen concentration, carbon fractions, and leaf mass per area (LMA). 15 Our analyses included more than 300 samples of senesced foliage from 11 species of temperate trees, 16 including needleleaf and broadleaf species. Across all samples, we could predict each trait with moderate17 to-high accuracy from both intact-leaf litter spectra (validation R 2 = 0.543-0.941; %RMSE = 7.49-18.5) 18 and ground-leaf litter spectra (validation R 2 = 0.491-0.946; %RMSE = 7.00-19.5). Ground-leaf spectra 19 yielded better estimates of mass-based chemical traits, while intact-leaf spectra yielded better predictions 20 of LMA. Our results support the feasibility of building models to estimate multiple chemical traits from 21 leaf litter of a range of species. In particular, the success of intact-leaf spectral models allows non22 destructive trait estimation in a matter of seconds, which could enable researchers to measure the same 23 leaves over time in studies of nutrient resorption. 24 25",

            "text": "Measuring the chemical traits of leaf litter is important for understanding plants\u2019 roles in nutrient cycles, 11 including through nutrient resorption and litter decomposition, but conventional leaf trait measurements 12 are often destructive and labor-intensive. Here, we develop and evaluate the performance of partial least-13 squares regression (PLSR) models that use reflectance spectra of intact or ground leaves to estimate leaf 14 litter traits, including carbon and nitrogen concentration, carbon fractions, and leaf mass per area (LMA). 15 Our analyses included more than 300 samples of senesced foliage from 11 species of temperate trees, 16 including needleleaf and broadleaf species. Across all samples, we could predict each trait with moderate-17 to-high accuracy from both intact-leaf litter spectra (validation R 2 = 0.543-0.941; %RMSE = 7.49-18.5) 18 and ground-leaf litter spectra (validation R 2 = 0.491-0.946; %RMSE = 7.00-19.5). Ground-leaf spectra 19 yielded better estimates of mass-based chemical traits, while intact-leaf spectra yielded better predictions 20 of LMA. Our results support the feasibility of building models to estimate multiple chemical traits from 21 leaf litter of a range of species. In particular, the success of intact-leaf spectral models allows non-22 destructive trait estimation in a matter of seconds, which could enable researchers to measure the same 23 leaves over time in studies of nutrient resorption. 24 25 Keywords: decomposition; functional traits; nutrient cycling; nutrient resorption; partial least-squares 26 regression (PLSR); reflectance spectroscopy 27\nIntroduction 28 Long-lived plants resorb and store a large fraction of the nutrients from their leaves before they senesce. 29 These reserves support early growth in the following growing season and reduce the need for nutrient 30 uptake from the soil (El Zein et al. 2011). But nutrient resorption (much like soil nutrient uptake) has 31 metabolic and physiological costs, so the optimal level of nutrient resorption varies among environments 32 (Wright & Westoby 2003). Accordingly, species vary broadly in their nutrient resorption efficiency\u2014the 33 fraction of a given nutrient that is resorbed (Vergutz et al. 2012). For example, plants often (Kobe et al. 34 2005; Hayes et al. 2014; Yuan & Chen 2015), though not always (Diehl et al. 2003), resorb a greater 35 fraction of leaf nutrients when soil nutrients are scarce. This adjustment of resorption efficiency in 36 response to the environment highlights the key role of resorption in plant nutrient economics. 37 38 Resorption often leaves the resulting leaf litter relatively nutrient-poor, which can limit the rate of 39 decomposition of newly shed litter by soil microorganisms (Berg 2014). Hence, nutrient-poor litter 40 decomposes more slowly than nutrient-rich litter at first (Cornwell et al. 2008), although this trend can 41 reverse in later stages (Prescott 2010; Berg 2014; Gill et al. 2021). Because litter nutrient levels influence 42 the nutrient flux into soil inorganic or microbial pools via decomposition, resorption may be a key process 43 for explaining how plants influence their environment (Hobbie 2015). Despite the metabolic changes that 44 occur during senescence, relationships between fresh-leaf and leaf litter composition may help explain 45 why soil processes can often be inferred from remote sensing of aboveground vegetation (Madritch et al. 46 2020, Cavender-Bares et al. 2022). 47 48 Addressing many ecological questions about nutrient resorption and litter decomposition requires 49 measuring litter chemistry. Because measuring resorption efficiency requires the nutrient content of 50 leaves both before and after senescence, it can be expensive and labor-intensive. Furthermore, because 51 measuring nutrient concentration through elemental analysis is destructive, the same exact leaves cannot 52 be measured at each step. Decomposition also depends on litter traits beyond macronutrient 53\nconcentrations, including lignin, cellulose, condensed tannins, and various micronutrients (Schweitzer et 54 al. 2004; Cornwell et al. 2008; Talbot & Treseder 2012; Keiluweit et al. 2015; Bourget et al. 2023). The 55 number of traits and samples can add up to make even simple projects expensive and time-consuming. 56 57 Such complications may make it harder to understand and predict the fluxes of carbon and mineral 58 nutrients between plants, litter, and soil\u2014the determinants of which are still far from well-understood. 59 For example, large-scale comparative tests of the role of nutrient resorption in plant life history or nutrient 60 economics are still rare (e.g., Freschet et al. 2010; Rea et al. 2018). Meanwhile, research continues to 61 reveal new paths through which a plant community\u2019s litter traits or diversity interact with microbial 62 communities and the abiotic environment to influence decomposition rates (Liu et al. 2020; Grossman et 63 al. 2020; Gill et al. 2021; Bourget et al. 2023). Fast, simple estimates of litter traits could make it easier 64 both to study the functional significance of nutrient resorption and to estimate litter decomposability 65 rapidly across taxa and ecosystems. 66 67 The need for faster trait estimates has led some plant ecologists to turn to reflectance spectroscopy, a 68 technique that involves measuring the reflectance of light from a sample across many wavelengths. Many 69 kinds of samples, including leaf tissue, are analyzed using the 400-2400 nm range. Reflectance in this 70 range can be used to estimate many leaf structural and chemical traits because those traits influence how 71 leaves scatter and absorb light across wavelengths. 72 73 Many widely studied functional traits nevertheless cannot be identified with specific structures or 74 chemical constituents that have unique absorption features. Leaf nitrogen concentration (Nmass), for 75 example, includes nitrogen in molecules as varied as RuBisCO and chlorophyll. This challenge is among 76 the reasons that many plant scientists have adopted a multivariate empirical approach to linking traits and 77 reflectance spectra using statistical techniques like partial least-squares regression (PLSR; Burnett et al. 78 2021). Researchers have built PLSR models predicting traits like Nmass and leaf mass per area (LMA) with 79\na high degree of accuracy from spectra, measured either while the leaf was fresh or after drying and 80 grinding it into powder (Serbin et al. 2014; Serbin et al. 2019; Kothari et al. 2023a; Kothari et al. 2023b). 81 Further research has shown that spectral models can predict traits as varied as defense compounds 82 (Couture et al. 2016), water status (Cotrozzi et al. 2017; Kothari et al. 2023a), leaf age (Chavana-Bryant 83 et al. 2017), and photosynthetic capacity (Dechant et al. 2017). 84 85 The vast majority of this research is based on measurements taken during the growing season, before the 86 onset of leaf senescence. These models are not expected to accurately predict the traits of senesced leaves, 87 which are well outside the scope of their training data. Some researchers have built models to predict 88 decomposition-related traits (Joffre et al. 1992; McTiernan et al. 2003; Co\u00fbteaux et al. 2005; Hobbie 89 2005; Petit Bon et al. 2020) or the decomposition rate itself (Gillon et al. 1999; Fortunel et al. 2009) from 90 ground leaf litter using near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectroscopy. Many traits that influence 91 decomposition also influence forage quality, and there is an extensive body of research predicting forage 92 traits using NIR spectroscopy, including in senescent foliage (e.g., Norris et al. 1976). Such studies have 93 often shown high accuracy (R 2 > 0.9) in predicting traits like Nmass, carbon fractions, and phenolics, albeit 94 usually using a limited number (<120) of calibration samples from one or a few species. 95 96 Here, we expand on prior work by building models to predict traits related to litter quality and 97 recalcitrance from reflectance spectra. Compared to previous studies, we calibrate and validate our 98 models using more samples from more species. This breadth allows us to make predictions over a wide 99\nrange of trait values and test how well models predict both intra- and interspecific trait variation. We also 100 measured spectra from the same samples both while intact and ground. Existing models to predict leaf 101 litter traits require the destructive and time-consuming step of grinding the tissue, which motivated us to 102 test whether spectra of whole, intact litter could also yield accurate estimates. We predicted that ground-103 leaf litter spectra would provide more accurate estimates of chemical traits than intact-leaf litter spectra, 104 as most comparisons on non-senesced leaves have shown (Serbin et al. 2014; Couture et al. 2016; Kothari 105\net al. 2023b). On the other hand, we predicted that intact-leaf litter spectra would outperform ground-leaf 106 litter spectra for estimating structural traits like LMA because grinding destroys the leaf structure (Kothari 107 et al. 2023b). 108 109 Finally, we verified whether our litter chemistry estimates could capture known differences among 110 species. We predicted that conifer litter would have greater LMA, recalcitrant carbon, and Cmass and lower 111 Nmass than broadleaf litter. These patterns are thought to explain much of why conifer litter tends to show 112 slower initial decomposition rates than broadleaf litter (Cornelissen et al. 1999; Cornwell et al. 2008; 113 Prescott 2010). 114 115 Methods 116 Samples 117 During fall 2018, we collected senescent leaf litter from the Forests and Biodiversity experiment (FAB1) 118 at Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve (East Bethel, MN, USA; Grossman et al. 2017). In May 2013, 119 one- to two-year-old trees were planted in a 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 m grid within plots that varied in their species 120 richness (1, 2, 5, or 12 species) and composition. The species pool included eight broadleaf angiosperms 121 and four needleleaf conifers (Table 1). We left out one species (Juniperus virginiana) from sampling 122 because its scaly needle morphology meant that individual trees seldom produced enough litter at once for 123 spectroscopic or chemical analyses. To get enough samples of another species (Acer negundo), we also 124 collected material from mature trees in a residential yard in Minneapolis, MN, USA 50.0 km from FAB1. 125 126 We collected litter samples as close as we feasibly could to the time of senescence using both litterfall 127 traps on the ground and hand-collection of senesced leaves from trees. We only took leaves from trees 128 when the petiole had a complete abscission layer and the leaf could be detached with a gentle pull 129 (Chapin & Moilanen 1991). Because tree species dropped their leaves at different times, we collected 130 litter repeatedly from September to November 2018 to ensure that the litter we collected had recently 131\nsenesced. To avoid leaching we discarded litter samples from traps after rain, although nitrogen and 132 carbon leaching tends to be low even under extreme wetting (Schreeg et al. 2013). 133 134 We collected 322 litter samples, seeking to represent the variation in leaf traits within each species (Table 135 1). While our sampling did not explicitly account for the species richness and composition treatments in 136 FAB1, we collected leaves from each species across neighborhoods and crown positions to enhance 137 intraspecific variation. Each sample included 1.5-3.0 g of tissue and could comprise one leaf or multiple 138 similar leaves. When a single trap contained more than 2.5-3.0 g of leaves from a single species, we 139 divided them into two or more samples by keeping together leaves that we judged by eye to be more 140 visually similar. We dried each sample in a dark shed at 40 \u00b0C for at least three days, and then stored 141 them in a cool, dark room until spectral and trait measurements. 142\nSpectral data collection 148 We measured reflectance spectra of each dried sample, both intact and ground, using a PSR+ 3500 full-149 range (350-2500 nm) spectrometer (Spectral Evolution, Lawrence, MA, USA). For intact-leaf spectra, we 150 used the Spectral Evolution leaf clip assembly. We used a built-in 99% Spectralon white reflectance 151 standard to calibrate readings before each sample. Among broadleaf species, many of the leaves curled in 152 on themselves during senescence and drying; when possible, we sought to measure spectra in relatively 153 flat portions of the leaf to minimize specular reflection (Petibon et al. 2021). Among needleleaf species, 154 we made mats by laying out needles in a single layer; because of their shape, there often remained small 155 gaps or areas of overlap between needles. We discarded spectra with large discrepancies in sensor overlap 156 regions, or (particularly for needleleaf species) with very high (>70%) or very low (<30%) peak 157 reflectance, which often indicated that the needle mat was highly non-uniform. There remained at least 158 three reflectance spectra for each sample, and more for most of the broadleaf samples that had multiple 159 leaves. 160 161 After removing their petioles, we ground leaf samples by placing them in individual plastic vials with ball 162 bearings and shaking them with a paint shaker for several hours. To measure ground-leaf spectra, we used 163 the Spectral Evolution benchtop reflectance probe and glass-windowed sample trays. Before measuring 164 each sample, we measured a white Spectralon panel placed in a sample tray for calibration. For sample 165 measurements, we put at least 0.6 g of leaf powder into a sample tray. Preliminary tests showed that 166 adding more material did not change the spectra, suggesting that transmittance was close to zero. The 167 benchtop probe pressed the loose powder into an even pellet. We measured three spectra per sample\u2014 168 turning the sample tray 120\u00b0 between the first two measurements, and loosening and mixing the powder 169 between the second and third measurements. 170 171 The spectrometer automatically interpolated the spectra to 1 nm resolution. We performed all subsequent 172 processing using spectrolab v. 0.0.18 (Meireles et al. 2023) in R v. 3.6.1 (R Core Team, 2019). Because 173\nthe 350-400 nm and 2400-2500 nm regions could be noisy, we trimmed each spectrum to 400-2400 nm. 174 For intact leaves only, we corrected discontinuities at the overlap region between the Si and first InGaAs 175 detectors (970-1000 nm) using the match_sensors() function, and spline-smoothed only this region using 176 the smooth_spline() function. Finally, we averaged all intact spectra and all ground spectra for a given 177 sample. As a metric of measurement consistency, we calculated the mean spectral angle between 178 measurements of the same sample (Kruse et al. 1993). Intact measurements (median across samples: 6.8\u00b0; 179\n2.5 th -97.5 th percentile: 2.9\u00b0-20.4\u00b0) showed much less consistency than ground measurements (median: 180\n0.6\u00b0; 2.5 th -97.5 th percentile: 0.2\u00b0-3.2\u00b0). 181 182 Leaf mass per area measurements 183 Researchers risk underestimating resorption efficiency when they fail to account for leaf mass loss during 184 resorption. To avoid this risk, many studies either express nutrient content of non-senesced and senesced 185 leaves on a per-area basis, or equivalently include a mass loss correction factor (van Heerwaarden et al. 186 2003). We measured LMA of each litter sample to enable conversion between a per-mass and per-area 187 basis. We did not attempt to quantify or correct for the smaller bias sometimes caused by leaf shrinkage 188 (van Heerwaarden et al. 2003). 189 190 For broadleaf species, we could not measure the area of whole leaves because many were curled and 191 brittle. Instead, we used a hole punch to take four to six 0.3 cm 2 disks from each dried leaf sample. We 192 sought to capture the variation within the sample, including veins. We calculated LMA as the total mass 193 divided by the total area of all disks. This method has generally been shown to provide accurate estimates 194 of the LMA of whole leaves (Perez et al. 2020). 195 196 For needleleaf species, we measured the mass and area of five needles per sample. We estimated area as 197 the length times the maximum width of the needle measured using digital calipers. We then measured the 198 mass of each needle and calculated LMA as the total mass divided by the total area. 199\n200 Chemical trait measurements 201 We measured leaf carbon and nitrogen concentration (Cmass and Nmass) on ground, oven-dried samples 202 using dry combustion gas chromatography performed by an elemental analyzer (Costech ECS 4010 203 Analyzer, Valencia, California, USA). We converted Cmass and Nmass to an area basis (Carea and Narea) by 204 multiplying them with LMA. 205 206 We measured carbon fractions on ground, oven-dried samples using an ANKOM 200 Fiber Analyzer 207 (Ankom Technology, Macedon, New York, USA). The first digestion in a hot neutral detergent solution 208 washes out plant solubles. The second digestion in a hot acidic detergent solution further washes out 209 bound proteins and hemicellulose (henceforth \u2018hemicellulose\u2019 for simplicity). The remaining fraction 210 comprises cellulose and acid-unhydrolyzable residue (AUR) such as lignin (henceforth \u2018recalcitrant 211 carbon\u2019). We estimated each component using the changes in sample mass between steps. Because the 212 paint shaker ground our samples into a very fine powder, we had to use small-pored ANKOM F58 fiber 213 bags, which cannot be used in the final acid detergent lignin digestion to measure AUR concentration 214 alone. We also did not determine the ash concentration of the samples. 215 216 We removed some trait values prior to statistical analyses because of clear issues during trait data 217 collection\u2014for example, the rupture of sample bags while measuring carbon fractions. Unlike some other 218 studies (e.g., Gillon et al. 1999), we only removed samples due to known issues with trait measurements, 219 not simply because they had large prediction residuals during statistical analyses. 220 221 Statistical analyses 222 We modeled the relationship between traits and spectra using partial least-squares regression (PLSR), 223 which is well-suited to handle datasets that include many collinear predictors (Burnett et al. 2021). PLSR 224 reduces the full matrix of spectra to a smaller number of orthogonal latent components that best explain 225\nthe variation in the variables to be predicted. We implemented our PLSR models in R package pls v. 2.7.1 226 (Mevik et al. 2019). 227 228 Previous studies using a PLSR modeling framework have often restricted the range of wavelengths used 229 to predict certain traits in order to select bands that, based on prior research or known absorption features, 230 may be most causally linked to the traits in question (e.g., Serbin et al. 2014). In our main set of analyses, 231 we used the full spectrum (400-2400 nm) to predict each trait on the grounds that biochemical changes 232 during senescence may alter the relationship between integrative functional traits like Nmass and specific 233 optical features. However, we also explored two ways of restricting the spectral range for intact-leaf 234 spectra only. First, we built models using only 400-1000 nm (\u2018VIS/NIR models\u2019) given that many less-235 expensive spectrometers only measure this range. Second, we built models using only 1300-2400 nm 236 (\u2018SWIR models\u2019). The pigment composition of leaves changes rapidly during senescence, including 237 breakdown products (\u2018brown pigments\u2019) which may absorb up to 1300 nm (Fourty et al. 1996). The 238 SWIR models could perform better in cases where pigments are poor indicators of the overall 239 composition of the leaf. 240 241 Researchers may transform reflectance of ground-leaf spectra to pseudoabsorbance (-log R; Blackburn 242 1998; Serbin et al. 2014) or its derivatives, which may somewhat linearize the relationship between traits 243 and spectral features and make those features more prominent. We found in preliminary tests that these 244 transformations did not substantially improve model performance. Likewise, brightness normalization of 245 intact-leaf spectra (Feilhauer et al. 2010) did not have a strong influence on model performance. 246 247 We divided our samples into calibration (75%) and validation (25%) datasets, stratified such that the 248 proportions of each species were identical in each dataset. We fit models for each trait on the complete 249 calibration dataset, using 10-fold cross-validation to select the optimal number of model components to 250 use in further analyses while avoiding overfitting. We selected the smallest number of components whose 251\ncross-validation root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) was within one standard deviation of the 252 very lowest RMSEP at any number of components. We used these models to calculate the variable 253 importance in projection metric (VIP) for each trait (Wold et al. 1994) but we do not report their 254 accuracy. 255 256 We developed our main set of models using a resampling procedure in which we divided the calibration 257 data at random 200 times into 70% training and 30% testing subsets (Burnett et al. 2021). During each 258 resampling iteration, we trained a model for each trait on the 70% and assessed its performance (RMSE 259 and R 2 ) on the remaining 30%, using the previously determined number of components for that trait. This 260 procedure left us with an ensemble of 200 models for each trait, which could be used both to make trait 261 predictions and to examine the variability of model performance under random variation in training data. 262 263 We used these ensembles of models to predict traits from the validation (25%) dataset. We quantified 264 model performance for each trait by calculating R 2 and root mean squared error (RMSE) between the 265 predictions (averaged for each validation sample across the 200 estimates) and the measured values. We 266 also report the %RMSE, calculated as the RMSE divided by the 2.5% trimmed range of the measured 267 values in the validation data (Kothari et al. 2023a). 268\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

For 279 example, Nmass varied nearly 11-fold; in contrast, Cmass only varied about 1.5-fold (Table 2). In spite of the 280 high level of intraspecific variation, especially among broadleaf species, species identity alone could 281 account for between 46.0% (Narea) and 93.7% (LMA) of the variation in each trait. In general, needleleaf 282 species had much higher LMA, Cmass, recalcitrant carbon, and lower Nmass than broadleaf species (Table 283 S1), consistent with trends in non-senescent leaves (Serbin et al. 2014; Kothari et al. 2023a). 284 Consequently, we see correlations among pairs of leaf economic traits across the whole dataset (for 285\nlog(LMA) and log(Nmass), R 2 = 0.592; p < 10 -15 ), but a weaker correlation among just needleleaf samples 286\n(R 2 = 0.255; p < 10 -5 ) and none among just broadleaf samples (R 2 = 0.011; p = 0.111). 287 288 Among both ground-leaf and intact-leaf spectra, the coefficient of variation (CV) was highest in the 289 visible range and decreased into the near-infrared range (NIR; Fig. 1). For intact-leaf spectra only, the CV 290 once again increased into the short-wave infrared range (SWIR). There was a global maximum CV 291 around 440-490 nm for intact spectra, shifted to lower wavelengths for ground spectra; there were also 292 local maxima centered at around 670-675 nm for both kinds of spectra. Both maxima lie near absorption 293 peaks of chlorophylls, and reflectance at 670 nm is particularly sensitive to variation in chlorophyll at low 294 levels, such as during late senescence (Gitelson & Merzlyak 1996). 295 296 Each of our traits could be predicted with moderate-to-high success from full intact-leaf and ground-leaf 297 spectra (Figs. 2-4; Table 2). The models for Nmass and (especially for intact-leaf spectra) LMA achieved 298 the highest calibration and validation accuracy, followed by recalcitrant carbon, solubles, Cmass, and 299 finally hemicellulose (Table 2). There was no general tendency for estimation of chemical traits to be 300 better using intact- or ground-leaf spectra, but estimation of LMA was better using intact-leaf spectra. 301 Because we used LMA to convert from a mass to an area basis, we built models predicting Narea and Carea 302 (nitrogen and carbon on a per-area basis) only from intact-leaf spectra (Fig. 4). The Carea model (%RMSE 303\n= 8.02) had better performance than the Cmass model (%RMSE = 14.0), but the Narea model (%RMSE = 304 13.2) had worse performance than the Nmass model (%RMSE = 8.58; Table 2). Jackknife analyses showed 305 that traits for which the ensemble model performance was poorest\u2014such as hemicellulose, Cmass, and 306 Narea\u2014also had the greatest variability in model performance (Figs. S1 and S2). 307 308 For every trait prediction model trained on the full spectrum, the VIP metric also showed a global 309 maximum around 677 nm (intact) or 672 nm (ground; Fig. 5), next to one of the aforementioned 310 chlorophyll absorption peaks. This pattern suggests that the amount of chlorophyll remaining at 311 abscission may be closely related to many traits, especially Nmass. More generally, the visible range was 312 most important for predicting all traits, and the NIR range was also important for LMA. There were 313 further peaks in the SWIR around 1430-1450 nm (for intact leaves), 1910-1950 nm and 2130-2220 nm. In 314 fresh tissue, variation in reflectance around 1910-1950 nm is often interpreted as a measure of absorption 315 by water, but the trace amounts of water remaining in our dried samples likely have no direct biological 316 relevance. In general, reflectance in the visible range and parts of the SWIR range seemed most 317 informative in predicting nutrients and carbon fractions in litter. 318 319 Our VIS/NIR models for intact leaves had considerably worse performance than our full-range models for 320 every trait, particularly Nmass, Narea, and solubles. By contrast, our SWIR models had very similar 321 performance to the full-range models (Table S2). Both sets of restricted-range models had a similar rank-322 ordering of model performance across traits to each other and the full models. Moreover, the VIP metric 323 for these models revealed that the regions that were most important for these predictions were mainly the 324 same bands in their respective regions that were important for the full-range models; however, for the 325 VIS/NIR models, very low wavelengths close to 400 nm also had high importance. 326 327\n337 338\n341 342\nDiscussion 347 We show that PLSR models trained on reflectance spectra can accurately predict several leaf litter traits 348 related to nutrient cycling across temperate broadleaf and needleleaf tree species. For each trait, a single 349 model captures the variation among and within our 11 species. The models\u2019 predictions capture well-350 known ecological differences among species\u2014for example, that needleleaf species have more recalcitrant 351 carbon and lower Nmass than broadleaf species. Importantly, intact-leaf models are about as accurate as 352 ground-leaf models for most traits, which suggests that multiple traits can be estimated from a single 353 measurement that takes only seconds. 354 355 Model performance and interpretation 356 The hierarchy of which traits can be predicted best mirrors results from non-senesced leaves, including 357 fresh ones (Asner et al. 2011; Nunes et al. 2017; Kothari et al. 2023a). Leaf mass per area can be 358 predicted very well from intact-leaf spectra in particular, which has been shown in both fresh leaves 359 (Serbin et al. 2019) and in pressed, dried leaves (Costa et al. 2018; Kothari et al. 2023b). Predictions of 360 LMA from ground leaves are worse, but still quite good (Serbin et al. 2014). Nmass can also be predicted 361 nearly perfectly from intact- and ground-leaf spectra (Richardson & Reeves 2005; Serbin et al. 2014). 362 Recalcitrant carbon, solubles, and Cmass all can be predicted with R 2 > 0.65, while the smallest carbon 363 fraction (hemicellulose) shows the worst performance (Kothari et al. 2023b). For chemical traits, intact- 364 and ground-leaf models had only small and idiosyncratic differences in performance. 365 366 Our comparisons of variation among replicate spectral measurements within samples imply that grinding 367 homogenizes the variation in the leaf and allows more consistent measurements. This consistency may 368 owe to several factors. Veins and other features cause intact leaves to vary in their chemical makeup 369 across the laminar area, which may be hard to capture representatively. Likewise, if chemical traits 370 change with depth through the laminar cross-section, the optical features of deeper layers may be 371 obscured in part by shallower layers. The geometries of uneven needle mats and curled-up leaves may 372\nalso reduce consistency by increasing variation in anisotropic surface reflectance (Petibon et al. 2021). 373 Nevertheless, there was no strong, consistent indication that ground-leaf spectra are necessarily better 374 than intact-leaf spectra for predicting chemical traits. This result deviates from the few previous 375 comparisons of intact- and ground-leaf spectra (Serbin et al. 2014; Couture et al. 2016; Kothari et al. 376 2023b). It is unclear why the theoretical considerations in favor of ground-leaf spectra do not amount to 377 much in practice here; we speculate that information about structure might, depending on the context, 378 either confound or indirectly aid the prediction of chemical traits. 379 380 In contrast to chemical traits, LMA was clearly better predicted from intact-leaf spectra. Given that 381 grinding destroys the leaf structure, it may be perplexing that ground-leaf spectra predict structural traits 382 like LMA at all (Serbin et al. 2014; Kothari et al. 2023b). The relationship between ground-leaf spectra 383 and LMA is likely indirect, mediated through correlations between LMA and chemical traits that retain 384 clear optical signatures in ground tissue (Nunes et al. 2017; Kothari & Schweiger 2022). Since trait 385 correlations within species often differ from those among species (Anderegg et al. 2018), such effects can 386 explain why a model trained across many species may fail to capture intraspecific variation (Kothari & 387 Schweiger 2022). Indeed, in our dataset, ground-leaf spectra do a poor job of predicting intraspecific 388 variation in LMA; species-specific slopes of measured vs. predicted values are often far from 1. 389 390 Changing the basis of nitrogen and carbon from mass to area also changes the accuracy of estimates. 391 While Nmass is predicted more accurately than Narea, Cmass is predicted less accurately than Carea. Across 392 samples, Nmass correlates negatively and Cmass correlates positively with LMA, driven in large part by the 393 split between broadleaf (low LMA) and needleleaf (high LMA) species. As a result, multiplying by LMA 394 to convert N and C to an area basis flattens interspecific variation in N, but enhances it in C. For example, 395 the percentage of variation explained by species identity alone increases for carbon (R 2 from 0.721 for 396 Cmass to 0.945 for Carea), but decreases for nitrogen (R 2 from 0.786 for Nmass to 0.460 Narea). Absorption 397 features that differentiate species or functional groups can aid estimates of Carea much more than Narea, 398\nwhether or not they are causally related to those traits. Area- and mass-based traits often have different 399 uses: there is a strong justification for using area-based nutrients for studying resorption (van 400 Heerwaarden et al. 2003), while mass-based traits are more often used for explaining decomposition 401 (Cornwell et al. 2008), and a \u2018normalization-independent\u2019 basis has been proposed for making sense of 402 trait covariance (Osnas et al. 2018). In general, the basis of estimation should be determined by these 403 factors rather than the apparent accuracy of the models. 404 405 Visible-range wavelengths where chlorophyll and other pigments absorb had high importance in our main 406 set of full-range models. However, removing these wavelengths (\u2018SWIR models\u2019) did not decrease 407 performance while removing the SWIR range (\u2018VIS/NIR models\u2019) did. It seems that pigments are neither 408 essential for predicting litter chemistry, nor do they confound it. Although the bands where they absorb 409 are assigned high importance, much of the information may be redundant with that of the SWIR range, 410 where many leaf macromolecules absorb. However, those SWIR features are not fully redundant with the 411 information about pigments and leaf structure captured by the VIS/NIR range. The spectrum of leaf or 412 litter samples could remain more stable above 1300 nm over the long term (Kothari et al. 2023b), so the 413 SWIR models may also transfer better when sample preparation and storage practices are inconsistent. 414 415 Advancing spectroscopic estimation of litter traits 416 Compared to conventional measurements, spectroscopic estimates of plant tissue functional traits are easy 417 and fast to generate and can be non-destructive. Spectrometers are costly, but measuring each spectrum is 418 (on the margin) nearly free. Once samples have been collected and organized, measuring each sample\u2019s 419 intact-leaf spectrum takes under a minute. In contrast, both ground-leaf spectra and conventional 420 measurements require grinding leaves, which is time-consuming and destructive. Using our protocol, we 421 could measure the spectrum of a single ground sample (including sample tray preparation and cleanup) in 422 5-7 minutes, not including grinding time. In contrast, we found that doing both elemental and carbon 423\nfraction analysis takes about 25 minutes of operator time per sample. The time saved through 424 spectroscopic trait estimation grows as the number of traits of interest increases. 425 426 Many studies that leverage spectroscopy to address ecological questions use models tailored to the 427 particular species and tissues under study (e.g., McTiernan et al. 2003; Hobbie 2005; Fortunel et al. 428 2009). While this practice allows researchers more confidence in their trait estimates, it requires them to 429 spend time and money doing the manual trait measurements needed for calibration, which they must 430 repeat for any new study system they adopt. Spectroscopic trait estimation is unlikely to serve as a 431 complete substitute for standard measurements unless we can create models that are demonstrably 432 accurate across a wide range of species and conditions. 433 434 The good validation performance of our models does not guarantee accurate trait estimates from any set 435 of litter samples. To take one example, consider the aforementioned pattern that the ground-leaf model for 436 LMA often performs poorly within species, despite its strong performance across species. If it were used 437 to study intraspecific variation in litter traits, the model\u2019s estimates could be useless or even misleading. 438 Moreover, when models simply \u2018learn\u2019 to exploit any features that happen to correspond with LMA 439 among species within a given dataset\u2014without respect to their causal relationship with LMA\u2014they may 440 also transfer poorly to new species (Kothari & Schweiger 2022). This case is closely linked to the more 441 general problem in machine learning of distinguishing spurious and invariant correlations (Arjovsky et al. 442 2019). As the volume of available spectral data increases, taking care to assess out-of-sample 443 generalization and borrowing tools from machine learning could help us train better spectral models and 444 make more realistic judgments about their performance (Kattenborn et al. 2022; Cherif et al. 2023). 445 446 Recent studies have attempted to tackle the challenge of building global trait-spectra models. For 447 example, Serbin et al. (2019) show that a single model can accurately predict the LMA of fresh, non-448 senesced leaves across 11 sites from the tropics to the Arctic. It remains to be seen whether any single 449\nmodel could predict traits like Nmass or LMA from leaf tissue across many species at all stages of 450 senescence and decomposition. The predictive success of global models may rely on the constrained 451 patterns of trait covariation among non-senesced leaves\u2014for example, along continua from sun to shade 452 leaves or conservative to acquisitive leaves (Osnas et al. 2018)\u2014which may help in estimating traits that 453 are not themselves associated with strong absorption features (Nunes et al. 2017; Kothari & Schweiger 454 2022). However, the dramatic shifts in leaf chemistry and cellular structure during senescence (Keskitalo 455 et al. 2005)\u2014including pigment degradation and nutrient resorption\u2014could weaken some of these 456 relationships among traits, or between traits and their optical features. If so, it could be hard to build a 457 global model for senesced leaves that achieves the predictive success of global models for non-senesced 458 leaves. 459 460 Some evidence suggests that litter traits do in fact predictably covary with each other, and with non-461 senesced leaf traits (Freschet et al. 2010; Freschet et al. 2012; Jackson et al. 2013). But while most fresh 462 green leaves look alike, each species\u2019 leaves may senesce in its own way. For example, some of our 463 species (A. rubrum, Q. alba, Q. ellipsoidalis, Q. rubra) tend to produce reddish anthocyanins during 464 senescence, but the rest do not. The breakdown of certain metabolites during senescence also creates a 465 complex mixture of brown pigments (Fourty et al. 1996), which are poorly described and may vary from 466 species to species. Such variation could make the relationship between traits and optical features more 467 contingent for senescent foliage. 468 469 Even setting aside these concerns, model generality may also be complicated by differences in sample 470 preparation (e.g., grind size) and instruments, which may affect the spectrum in subtle but important ways 471 (Foley et al. 1998; Petibon et al. 2021). Overcoming these challenges may require investing in protocol 472 development, or in trying algorithms that are more flexible than PLSR in \u2018learning\u2019 the complex forms of 473 biological variation in heterogeneous datasets. In the meantime, it would be prudent for researchers who 474\nplan to use existing spectral models in new systems to take some conventional trait measurements in order 475 to validate model performance. 476 477 Finally, we note that plants produce and shed many kinds of tissue besides leaves, and these other litter 478 sources also contribute to nutrient cycling through resorption and decomposition (L\u00fc et al. 2012). 479 Reflectance spectroscopy may help measure nutrient-related traits in other tissues. For example, fine root 480 decomposition is an important but little-understood part of nutrient cycling; fine roots may contribute 481 nearly half of annual litter inputs in forests (Freschet et al. 2013) and vary considerably in resorption 482 efficiency (Freschet et al. 2010). Elle et al. (2019) showed that PLSR models built using near-infrared 483 reflectance spectroscopy can predict fine root lignin, which increases recalcitrance (See et al. 2019; but 484 see, in contrast, Sun et al. 2018). Continuing to develop models for other plant tissues could make it 485 easier to study how plants alter nutrient cycling in a holistic way. Likewise, nutrients other than nitrogen 486 often limit or co-limit growth and decomposition, and tools to estimate them quickly and cheaply could 487 advance the study of plant nutrient economies. However, estimates of some micronutrients from 488 reflectance spectra may be unreliable (Nunes et al. 2017; Kothari et al. 2023a), and other methods may 489 prove more useful (e.g., X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy; van der Ent et al. 2018). 490 491 Ultimately, whether accurate global models for predicting litter traits from spectra can be built is an 492 empirical question that can only be settled by amassing a wide variety of data. We take an initial step 493 towards this long-term goal by showing that reflectance spectroscopy can provide accurate litter trait 494 estimates across many temperate tree species that vary widely in their litter traits. This line of research 495 shows great promise in relieving some of the major limitations toward understanding plant functional 496 ecology in an ecosystem context. 497\nAcknowledgements 498 The University of Minnesota, including Cedar Creek, is located on the traditional and contemporary 499 Dakota and Ojibwe land.
