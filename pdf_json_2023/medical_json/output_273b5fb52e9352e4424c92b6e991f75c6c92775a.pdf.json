We therefore hypothesized that their ITD detection circuit might be modified by experience. To test this, we raised owls with unilateral ear inserts that delayed and attenuated the acoustic signal, then used the binaural neurophonic to measure ITD representation in the brainstem nucleus laminaris (NL) when they were adult. The ITD circuit is composed of delay line inputs to coincidence detectors, and we predicted that plastic changes would lead to shorter delays in the axons from the manipulated ear, and complementary shifts in ITD representation on the two sides. In owls that received ear inserts around P16, the maps of ITD shifted in the predicted direction, but only on the ipsilateral side, and only in those regions that had not experienced auditory stimulation prior to insertion. The contralateral map did not change. Thus, experience-dependent plasticity of the ITD circuit occurs in NL, and our data suggest that ipsilateral and contralateral delays are independently regulated. Thus, altered auditory input prior to, and during, sensory experience leads to long lasting changes in the representation of ITD.",

            "text": "Barn owls (genus Tyto) are altricial, blind and deaf when they hatch (Haresign and Moiseff, 1988; K\u00f6ppl et al., 2005). Young barn owls begin to acquire auditory sensitivity around day 4 posthatch (P4), their eyes open by about P10, their heads grow to adult width by about P30, and the growth of their facial ruff and sensitivity to high frequency sounds is complete by about P60 (Haresign and Moiseff, 1988; Rich and Carr, 1999a; K\u00f6ppl et al., 2005; Campenhausen and Wagner, 2006; Kraemer et al., 2017). Thus, the early life of barn owls is marked by increasing sensitivity to sound, and by increasing interaural time and level differences. This prolonged post-hatch development allowed us to examine the role of altered auditory experience on the ITD detection circuits.\nDetection of ITDs depends on precise coding of ongoing phase delay by the inputs to postsynaptic coincidence detectors in the nucleus laminaris (NL) which in turn depends on highly specialized morphology and physiology of its circuit elements (Carr and Konishi, 1990; McColgan et al., 2014; Carr et al., 2015). Previous studies had shown that this ITD detection circuit matures slowly (Kubke and Carr, 2000), and we hypothesized that neural delays might be modified by experience (Cheng and Carr, 2007). The adult NL contains large, well-ordered maps of ITD, which we exploited to test this hypothesis. We reasoned that, if axonal delay lines adjusted to temporally altered acoustic input, then the maps of ITD would be shifted compared to normal. To test this hypothesis, we first described the maps of ITD precisely (McColgan et al., 2014; Carr et al., 2015), then fitted 8 young owls (from P21) with unilateral ear-canal inserts (acoustic filtering devices) designed to introduce a time delay to inputs from that ear (Gold and Knudsen, 1999; K\u00f6ppl et al., 2012), and later compared their ITD maps with those of normal adult owls. The manipulated owls did not show altered maps of ITD (K\u00f6ppl et al., 2012). Although abnormal auditory experience starting around P25 induces adjustments in tuning for binaural localization cues in owl midbrain (Gold and Knudsen, 1999, 2000a, 2000b), we reasoned that P21 might be past a critical period for adjustment of delays in the brainstem NL. We therefore raised 6 owls from about P14 with unilateral earmold plugs, and report on the results of both studies here.\nMultiple critical periods have been documented at different levels of the auditory system (Polley et al., 2013; Persic et al., 2020). Early in development, before the emergence of hearing, waves of synchronous activity propagate through the developing auditory brainstem and are hypothesized to refine the tonotopic maps that define these circuits (Friauf and Lohmann, 1999; Jones et al., 2001; Kandler et al., 2009; Sonntag et al., 2009; Clause et al., 2014; Babola et al., 2018). Upon hearing onset, connections in brainstem nuclei are rapidly refined, and at this time appear most vulnerable to disruption by deafening and noise rearing (Kapfer et al., 2002; Werthat et al., 2008; Kandler et al., 2009; Sonntag et al., 2009;\nPopescu and Polley, 2010; Butler and Lomber, 2013; Polley et al., 2013; Clarkson et al., 2016; Babola et al., 2018; Persic et al., 2020). Many synaptic and ionic mechanisms contribute to observed refinement and can exhibit their own patterns of maturation (for reviews see (Trussell, 1999; Sanes, 2002; Kandler and Gillespie, 2005; Kubke and Carr, 2006; Tzounopoulos and Kraus, 2009; Klug et al., 2012; MacLeod and Carr, 2012; Ngodup et al., 2015; Kohrman et al., 2021)). The onset of phase locking appears to follow closely upon hearing onset (Sanes, 1993; Brenowitz and Trussell, 2001; Crins et al., 2011; Dyke et al., 2017). Phase locking is a prerequisite for ITD detection since precise timing of binaural inputs underlies coincidence detection. We assume here that the onsets of hearing and phase locking are close together in time in the barn owl (K\u00f6ppl, 2007).\nUnilateral hearing loss has profound effects on binaural circuits (Moore et al., 1999; Moore and King, 2004; Sanes and Bao, 2009; Popescu and Polley, 2010; Persic et al., 2020). Recent reviews have outlined the effects of hearing loss on auditory brainstem plasticity (Sanes and Bao, 2009; Tzounopoulos and Kraus, 2009; Anderson et al., 2010; Keating and King, 2013; Friauf et al., 2015; Lauer et al., 2019; Persic et al., 2020; Rubio, 2020), and upon localization behavior in rats ((Clements and Kelly, 1978), ferrets (Moore et al., 1999; Keating and King, 2013; Kumpik and King, 2019), gerbils (Maier et al., 2008) and barn owls (Knudsen, 2002; Bergan and Knudsen, 2007; Keuroghlian and Knudsen, 2007). Previous studies have shown clear refinement of inputs to the ITD sensitive neurons of the mammalian medial superior olive (Kapfer et al., 2002; Chang et al., 2003; Magnusson et al., 2005; Werthat et al., 2008; Winters and Golding, 2018).\nIn the present study, we examined the effects of unilateral hearing loss on ITD coding in vivo in NL, the first binaural nucleus in the barn owl. These recordings were possible because NL is large and has reproducible maps of ITD (Carr et al., 2015). The maps are created by afferent delay lines whose responses sum in NL to create a binaural ITD-sensitive neurophonic (kuokkanen 2013). Recordings from these well-ordered maps allowed for detection of the small ITD shifts associated with conductive hearing loss."

            "text": "In our first experiments (K\u00f6ppl et al. 2012), owls (n=8, 2 T. furcata and 6 T. alba) were raised with acoustic filtering devices (Gold and Knudsen, 1999). Two owls (T. furcata) were first binaurally occluded with dense foam rubber earplugs (E.A.R. Cabot) to limit auditory experience from 20 to 28 days of age (P20-P28), corresponding to the time that their ear canals were open but too narrow to accommodate the device. Around 29 days of age, the binaural foam plugs were removed, and the filtering device was sutured into the right ear canal. The other 6 (T. alba) were raised beginning with a modified acoustic filtering device that could fit a younger ear canal (5.5 - 7.5 mm diameter of the ear-canal part), which was then replaced with a full size (8.5 mm diameter) device when the ear canals were large enough (Table 1). The foam earplugs and the acoustic filtering devices were sutured into place while the owls were anesthetized with isofluorane (1-2%). The acoustic filtering device was designed by Gold (Gold and Knudsen, 1999) to alter auditory experience, and custom-made from acetal delrin (Plastics SRT). A small, circular flange fit tightly to the inner walls of the ear canal, and the rest of the device was located just behind the preaural flap and in front of the facial ruff feathers. The device was designed to increase the\npath length of sound reaching the affected ear and to change the resonance properties of the ear canal while still providing a low- impedance pathway to the tympanic membrane. One owl (T. alba) was raised with an early version of the filtering device that had a shorter and smaller diameter chamber; the acoustic properties of this device were not measured. All 8 owl chicks were raised to minimum age of 3 months wearing the devices (see Table 1).\nSince the acoustic filtering device did not appear to affect the map of ITD in the NL, a further 6 owl chicks (T. furcata) were raised with unilateral impression earmold plugs (Gold Velvet, Oklahoma City) inserted into the left ear canal under 1% isofluorane anesthesia. These earmold plugs could be inserted at an earlier age (around P14) to limit auditory experience. Starting at P14, the average diameter of the ear canal was about 1.8 mm, increasing to about 6.2 mm at day 30 (Haresign and Moiseff, 1988). During this first month after hatching, the ear opening diameter increases fairly linearly (y = 0.2x - 0.25), and it was possible to insert an earmold plug after about P14. The 6 owls, plus 2 age matched controls, were handraised in a Brinsea TLC-4 incubator (N. Somerset, UK), with temperature adjusted every few days as their thermoregulation ability increased (Rich and Carr, 1999b). The earmold plugs were examined daily and replaced every few days as the ear canals grew until the owls were about 3 months old. The plugs were then removed and the owls were returned to the aviary to reach adulthood (> 6 months), after which their maps of ITD were measured. Block of the middle ear was not possible because the large interaural canal that connects the two ears (Gans et al., 2012; Kettler et al., 2016).\nAuditory Brainstem Responses (ABR)\nTo determine if plug rearing led to long lasting changes in sensitivity,we used auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to measure sensitivity in free field in 4 adult owls that had been raised with an earmold insert, and in 4 age matched controls (Fig. 1A). The plugs were removed prior to ABR recordings. For comparison with previous measurements, we used the same protocol and equipment as in (Kraemer et al., 2017). Owls were anesthetized by intramuscular injection of xylazine and ketamine. Doses were calculated using the weight formula (0.0004*weight (kg) = X mL 20mg/ml xylazine, 0.00025*weight (kg) = X mL 100mg/ml ketamine). Owls were placed in a large anechoic chamber (I.A.C.), wrapped in a heating blanket (38\u00b0C) with their head positioned 30 cm away from the speaker. Lidocaine was applied to the skin prior to inserting the electrodes subcutaneously. TDT software BioSigRP was used to present stimuli and record from the three platinum subdermal needle electrodes. The negative electrode behind the ear facing directly towards the speaker, the ground electrode behind the opposite ear, and the active electrode directly on the midline vertex of the barn owl\u2019s head. We used SigGenRP software (TuckerDavis Technologies, Gainesville, Florida) to create tone-burst stimuli, which were fed through an RP2.1 (TDT). The electrode signal was processed using a Medusa Digital Biological Amplifier System (RA4L Head stage and RA16PA PreAmp, RA16BA Medusa Base station). After data collection, the signals were notch filtered at 60 Hz, low-pass filtered at 3000 Hz, and high-pass filtered at 30 Hz in the \u201cBIOSIG\u201d software. Thresholds for clicks and individual frequencies were established as the lowest stimulus level where any recognizable feature of the waveform was discernible, using visual inspection (Kraemer et al., 2017). Thresholds were defined as the decibel level between the trace with a detectable peak and the trace\nwithout a detectable peak, so were either 5 dB or 2.5 dB SPL below the detectable peak. At least two thresholds (from 300 stimulus repetitions each) were determined for each frequency per trial. Thresholds were then averaged for each bird. ABR audiograms from owls raised with an earplug were not statistically different from the normal population except for the 0.5 kHz point in the plug reared owls and the 6.3 kHz point in the control group. A one-way ANOVA revealed a statistically significant difference in threshold between the two groups (F(7) = 12.715, p = 0.012).\nWe also measured the effect of acute earmold plug insertion (unilateral and bilateral) in 2 P21 owls to determine the degree of attenuation caused by the earmold plugs around the time of insertion (Fig. 1B, C). We used the same ABR setup as before, with free field stimulation. We therefore measured the effect of both monaural and binaural earplug insertion and compared normal ABRs with ABRs recorded with bilateral and unilateral plugs (Fig. 1B). Above 2 kHz, mean bilateral attenuation for P21 animals was 16\u00b13 dB, and for adult owls 17\u00b14 dB (data not shown). An unbalanced one-way ANOVA showed significant differences in detection thresholds between normal and earplugged conditions for frequencies between 0.5-8 kHz in the adult owl (F1,13 =19.47, p<0.0007, not shown), and for frequencies between 0.5-6.3 kHz in the P21 chick (F1,10 =9.16, p<0.013, data in Fig. 1B, compare P21 bilateral and no plug)."

Anesthesia was induced by intramuscular injections of 16 mg/kg/hr ketamine hydrochloride (\"Ketavet\" Phoenix, St. Joseph, MO) plus 3 mg/kg/hr xylazine (\"Xyla-ject\", Phoenix). Supplementary doses of ketamine and xylazine were administered to maintain a suitable plane of anesthesia. Body temperature was measured by a cloacal probe and kept constant at 39\u00baC by a feedback-controlled heating blanket wrapped around the owl's body (Harvard Instruments, Braintree, MA). An electrocardiogram was used to monitor the plane of anesthesia.\nInitially, the owl's head was firmly held in a controlled position by a custom-designed stereotaxic apparatus, using ear bars and a beak holder designed to position the head at 70\u00b0 to the visual axis. Then a metal head plate and marker of a standardized zero point was permanently glued to the skull. After this, the ear bars and beak holder were removed, and the head held by the head plate alone. A craniotomy was made around the desired area relative to the zero point and a small hole made in the dura mater, taking care to avoid blood vessels. Each electrode was positioned at defined rostrocaudal and mediolateral locations, before being advanced into the brain. In some cases, the electrode was angled to facilitate access to the most medial regions of the brainstem."

Two separate channels of signals could be generated, passing through separate channels of associated hardware and driving two separate earphones (Yuin PK2, China). The earphones were housed in custombuilt, calibrated from 0.1-10 kHz, closed sound systems inserted into the owl's left and right ear canals, respectively.

Once auditory neurophonic responses were discernable, tonal stimuli of varying frequencies were applied from both the ipsi- and contralateral side to judge the position of the electrode. To map best ITD within an isofrequency band, we made multiple stereotaxically controlled penetrations through the overlying cerebellum into NL. Apart from low-frequency NL, which has a lateral bend where frequencies from 500 - 2,000 Hz are represented (Takahashi and Konishi, 1988; K\u00f6ppl, 1997, 2001), NL is sufficiently large and ordered for 3 - 4 serial penetrations along the same isofrequency slab within an 8-hour experimental period.\nAt a given recording site, the following protocol was tested to obtain a data set. To determine best frequency, average threshold crossings of the neurophonic potential in response to 3 - 5 repetitions of each stimulus were calculated within the stimulus window. This paradigm was chosen to derive isointensity frequency response curves for best frequencies between 2 - 7.5 kHz. Best interaural time differences (ITDs) were determined using two assumptions; first, that ITD tuning changed continuously with depth. Second, that ITDs at or close to 0 \u00b5s would occur within a penetration (a best ITD of 0 \u00b5s). Best ITD were calculated from responses to either tone bursts presented binaurally at the estimated best frequency or to stimulation with noise bursts. The noise had a spectrum between 0.1 and 13 kHz, 5-ms rise/fall times, and duration of 100 ms. The overall level of the noise varied between 20 - 60 dB SPL. ITDs generally covered about two periods at the best frequency of a location. The tuning to ITD was judged by a Rayleigh test (p < 0.05). We recorded from both sides of the brain, with left ear leading ITDs described as negative, and right positive."

After the experiment, the responses were quantitatively analyzed with custom-written software (MATLAB; BEDS\nscripts from G. B. Christianson). Frequency and ITD tuning were quantified using the variance of the ongoing neurophonic response; onset effects were excluded, and we averaged the variance over several trials. Only those recordings with both frequency and ITD tuning (Kuokkanen et al., 2013; Carr et al., 2015) were accepted. The vector strength (vs) of the ITD tuning of the response variance was evaluated at each recording depth, and required to be > 0.02 and significant at p < 0.05 (Kuokkanen et al 2010).\nBF tuning curves at sites with weak neurophonic ITD tuning were included if there was a strong ITD tuning of the cyclic mean amplitude (Kuokkanen et al 2010, 2013) of vs > 0.1 and P<0.005. The monaural frequency-response curves were typically recorded multiple times during a penetration, and the maximum Signal to Noise Ratio (SNRmax) was required to be at least 10 dB within the range of stimulus frequencies for both stimulus sides. We also cross-correlated the frequency response curves to ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation at each recording site to determine if there were a relationship between interaural mismatches in frequency tuning and ITD tuning. The BF response curves were linearly interpolated between stimulus frequencies to about 1-5 Hz resolution to ensure a smooth crosscorrelation curve. The frequency-lag at the maximum of the cross-correlation was used to describe the shift between the tuning curves."

            "text": "Since the development of stable ITD cues coincides with development of brainstem auditory circuits, we hypothesized that delays might be modified by experience (Fig. 2). We used the accessible map of ITDs in the NL to test this hypothesis in young owls raised with unilateral earplugs. (Gold and Knudsen, 1999; Popescu and Polley, 2010) Both types of inserts attenuate as well as delay the acoustic stimulus to the manipulated ear, in a frequency specific manner. It is important to note that ITD coding by the brainstem NL is based on phase-locked neural inputs whose preferred phase is basically invariant with sound level (review: Heil and Peterson, 2015; barn owl: K\u00f6ppl, 1997b; Wagner et al., 2005). Thus, although acoustic attenuation will additionally delay neural onset responses (Wagner et al., 2005), this effect is predicted to be negligible here, and the dominant effect of the ear inserts is assumed to be a unilateral, frequency dependent phase shift of the neural inputs to the developing NL on both sides of the brainstem. We predicted that, if compensation were to occur, the manipulated-ear inputs should become \u201cfaster\u201d, i.e. show a decrease in delay when the plug is removed. If compensation were comprehensive, changes of up to 50 \u00b5s are to be expected which corresponds to the typical acoustic delay effected by the ear inserts for frequencies up to 5-6 kHz (Knudsen et al., 1984; Gold and Knudsen, 1999). At still higher frequencies, the introduced acoustic delays are smaller. We tested this hypothesis by looking for a shift in the map of ITD after the auditory system matured. From dorsal to ventral in brainstem recordings, the NL contains an ordered representation of contralateral ITDs and a smaller representation of ipsilateral space, covering a total range of ~200 \u00b5s ITD (Carr et al., 2015). Thus, a \u201cfaster\u201d ipsilateral input should cause the representation of frontal space, around 0 \u00b5s ITD, to be represented significantly more ventrally within NL, when tested with the ear insert removed (Fig. 2D). We had previously characterized the normal ITD map to be able to determine if changes in early experience led to long lasting changes in the brainstem map of ITDs (McColgan et al., 2014; Carr et al., 2015).\nOwls Raised with an Early inserted Unilateral Earmold Plug had Altered Maps of ITD\nTo measure the effect of plug raising on the development of the map of ITD, we compared ITD maps in normal owls (Carr et al., 2015) with maps recorded in 6 owls raised with an earmold plug. In normal owls, ITD maps show a steady shift in the position of 0 \u00b5s best ITD in the mediolateral dimension within any isofrequency slab (Fig. 2). Thus, 0 \u00b5s best ITD is mapped dorsal in medial NL and ventral in lateral NL (Carr et al., 2015). In normal owls, this shift is described by a regression of y = -0.74x + 0.78, R2=0.64 (Figures 2B red line, 6B black line, Carr et al., 2015).\nIt is possible to detect microsecond shifts in best ITD in the experiments in barn owls raised with an earplug because the ITD maps recorded in NL are highly reproducible (Sullivan and Konishi, 1986; Wagner et al., 2005; Carr et al., 2015) (Fig. 2A). We identified the 0 \u00b5s points as precisely as possible using online analyses (mean = -3.8 \u00b15.5 \u00b5s, n=61) prior to making a lesion. The best ITDs were confirmed off-line using measures of signal to noise (SNR (Kuokkanen et al., 2010)) and found to be close to the online measurements (mean = -5.7\u00b110.0\u00b5s, mean difference 1.8\u00b17.3 \u00b5s, n=61). We reconstructed the lesion locations to determine if there were changes in the map of ITDs (Fig. 3A, B).\nIf the maps of ITD were to adapt to decreased sensory experience from the plugged ear, we predicted that a decrease in delay could create a normal map (Fig. 2) that would be revealed by a ventral-ward shift in the map of ITD on the side with the hearing loss, after the plugs were removed (Fig. 2D). On the brainstem side contralateral to the earmold plug, a decreased contralateral delay (mediated by the same NM neurons on the manipulated side) would then cause an equal and opposite dorsal-ward shift in the maps of ITD. In other words, we hypothesized that the maps of ITD in the ipsilateral and contralateral NL would shift in opposite directions. We quantified the maps of ITD as above and found evidence for\nplastic shifts in the maps of ITD in the owls raised with an earmold plug. In these owls, the maps of best ITD ipsilateral to the earmold plug were shifted ventrally, consistent with the prediction (Fig. 2D), but the maps of ITD contralateral to the earmold plug were unaffected, not consistent with the prediction of change on both sides.\nNL is tonotopically organized, with low best frequencies mapped caudally, and progressively higher frequencies rostrally. A band across the mediolateral dimension of NL, oriented along a diagonal of about 45\u00b0 to the midline, represents a single frequency and is referred to as an isofrequency band (Takahashi and Konishi, 1988; Carr and Konishi, 1990; Carr et al., 2013). We made multiple penetrations through the short, dorsoventral axis of NL within each isofrequency band to measure ITD tuning (Fig. 2, 3A), both ipsilateral and contralateral to the side that had experienced the earmold plug. We could not be blind to the side of the earplug, but analyses of lesion positions were blinded (Fig. 3). In birds raised with an earmold plug we found a systematic ventral-ward shift in the representation of 0 \u00b5s best ITD in the NL, ipsilateral to the earmold plug (Fig. 3C). The maps of ITD in the contralateral NL were not statistically different from the normal maps of ITD (Fig. 3D), i.e. they shared similar slopes and yintercepts to those of the control owls (Carr et al., 2015). Furthermore, whether the maps shifted depended on the tonotopic region examined (Fig. 3C). Only ITD maps in the high best frequency region of NL showed plastic shifts.\nMaps of ITD were not plastic after the onset of hearing\nAt first, we combined results from all iso-frequency bands because, in normal birds, the range of ITDs did not change with frequency, at least within the 3-8 kHz range examined (Carr et al., 2015). However, we were only able to insert the earmold plug around P14-18, or around the age when the owl chicks could hear frequencies between 500 Hz-5 kHz (K\u00f6ppl and Nickel, 2007; Kraemer et al., 2017). We therefore reanalyzed the data and separated the results by frequency, i.e., position along the tonotopic axis. The ITD maps from the 3-5 kHz regions of NL were not different to the normal ITD map while the ITD maps from 5-7.5 kHz were shifted ventral (Fig. 2D, 3C). The slopes of each regression were not different, but the yintercepts were, suggesting a ventral-ward shift of about 30%, corresponding to a shift in best ITD of approximately 50 \u00b5s. Since owls only begin to hear frequencies above 5 kHz after P16 (K\u00f6ppl and Nickel, 2007; Kraemer et al., 2017)), these results were consistent with the prediction that only a brief period of auditory experience was required for the neural delay lines in the ITD circuit to finally mature.\nBalance of ipsi- and contralateral inputs\nWe next compared the strength of the inputs to the coincidence detectors from each side. We compared both the BF- and the ITD-sensitivity of the neurophonic responses in low-BF (unshifted) and high-BF (shifted) regions of NL with matching responses from the contralateral NL, and with measurements from age-matched controls (Fig. 4). Computational modeling and analysis of monaural neurophonic responses have shown that the neurophonic potential in NL is generated by hundreds of statistically independent sources, suggesting the afferent delay lines from the nucleus magnocellularis are its primary contributors (Kuokkanen et al., 2010, 2013, 2018). We therefore used the neurophonic to quantify the strength of the response from each ear, using the signal to noise (SNR) of the monaural neurophonic responses to tones. This allowed us to compare ipsi- and contralateral inputs to NL on both sides of the brainstem (plug and no plug sides), and to compare these with age-matched controls (Fig. 4). These analyses helped to separate the role of location (left NL, ipsilateral to the plug vs. the normal or right NL) from experience (recording from ipsi- and contralateral inputs within each NL, where one input originated from the plug side, and the other from the unmanipulated side).\nWe assessed the influence of rearing with a unilateral earmold plug on the SNRmax of neurophonic responses to monaural stimulation at BF using a linear mixed-effects model incorporating recording side (plug or no plug, each divided into recordings from ipsi- and contralateral inputs on both sides of the\nbrainstem as described in the methods section), BF-population (above or below 5 kHz), and the interaction of side and BF-population as fixed factors, and subject ID as a random effect. The linear mixed model showed a strong (p<0.0001, Table 2) effect of the earmold plug on SNRmax. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons between groups with a Tukey adjustment of p-values for multiple comparisons showed that ipsilateral inputs to NL on the same side as the earmold plug (\u201eLL\u201c in Fig. 4) were significantly weaker than the ipsilateral inputs to the contralateral NL (RR) and also weaker than the agematched controls (Fig. 4A, E). This effect was strongest for the high-BF population (<0.0001), but also significant for the low-BF population (Table 3). Furthermore, responses originating from the same NM neurons showed reduced SNRs of their axonal arbors on the plug side (LL), but not on the unmanipulated side (RL; P>0.0178), implicating a side-specific or local effect. In summary, the strength of inputs to coincidence detectors in NL on plug side was reduced, with the strongest effect in the high best frequency regions of NL on the plug side (Fig. 4F).\nWe also quantified the binaural ITD tuning from both plug and no-plug sides, using SNRmax to determine if there were a loss of synchrony associated with plug-rearing. The best ITD of each recording location was determined from the variance of the cyclic-mean signal (Kuokkanen et al., 2018), which corresponded to the circular-mean direction (mean phase) of the variance as a function of ITD (Fig. 5B, D). As before, we used a linear mixed model incorporating recording side (plug or no plug), BFpopulation (above or below 5 kHz), and the interaction of side and BF-population as fixed effects, and subject ID as a random effect. A statistical test of the model showed significant effects of side (p=0.0176); however, post-hoc pairwise comparisons found significant differences in SNRmax among recordings from the plugged and unplugged sides only for the high BF-population (p=0.0273, Fig. 5G). Thus, rearing with a unilateral earmold plug could be associated with a decrease in SNR, again implicating a side-specific local effect.\nFinally, the stereausis hypothesis predicts that ITD tuning may be altered if ipsilateral and contralateral inputs originate from different cochlear positions, with different frequency tuning (Shamma et al., 1989; Pena et al., 2001; Carr et al., 2009; Plau\u0161ka et al., 2017). We therefore investigated the relationship between interaural mismatches in frequency tuning and plug side (Fig. 5H). Ipsi- and contralateral inputs to NL were not always matched in BF, and sometimes the frequency mismatch could be large enough to affect ITD tuning. However, we found no significant differences between ipsi- and contralateral BF in any groups (Fig. 5H, H*), independent of whether there was a plug in one of the ears or not (age-matched control owls). Our data thus suggest that frequency tuning mismatches cannot account for the shifts in ITD tuning associated with rearing with a monaural earmold plug.\nMaps of ITD were Unaffected by Rearing with a Unilateral Acoustic Filtering device\nBoth unilateral acoustic filtering devices and earmold earplugs were used to assess the role of experience in the development of sensitivity to ITDs in NL. The acoustic filtering device increased the path length of sound reaching the affected ear and changed the resonance properties of the ear canal while still providing a low-impedance pathway to the tympanic membrane (Gold and Knudsen (Gold and Knudsen, 1999). These early experiments, however, only yielded an increase in the variability of the map of ITDs (Fig. 6)(K\u00f6ppl et al., 2012), leading to the hypothesis that brainstem and midbrain auditory circuits experienced different developmental windows for auditory plasticity.\nWhen we used the unilateral acoustic filtering devices to assess the role of experience in the development of sensitivity to ITDs in 8 barn owl chicks, we found similar maps of ITD to the normal maps (Fig. 6B). The normal ITD map is characterized by a steady shift in the position of 0 \u00b5s best ITD(Carr et al., 2015), described by a regression of y = -0.74x + 0.78, R2=0.64 (Figure 6B, black line). In the owls raised with acoustic filtering devices, the maps of ITD were not statistically different to the normal owls (Fig. 6B, blue lines). The ITD maps did, however, appear to be less organized, i.e., the regressions explained less of the variance."

It was possible to examine the effects of these manipulations at the level of the brainstem in barn owls because of the large size and reproducible nature of the ITD maps in NL (Carr et al., 2015). The maps are created by afferent axonal delay lines whose responses sum in NL to create a binaural ITD-sensitive neurophonic (Sullivan and Konishi, 1986; Wagner et al., 2005, 2009). We found long lasting changes in the map of ITDs associated with a brief window for plasticity around the onset of hearing. Furthermore, shifts in the map of ITDs were restricted to the side of the hearing loss, suggesting independent regulation of ipsilateral and contralateral circuits for detection of ITD."

            "heading": "Effects of Monaural Occlusion",
            "text": "Young owls learn to associate particular ITDs with corresponding locations in space (Keller and Takahashi, 1996; Poganiatz and Wagner, 2001). Knudsen and his colleagues analyzed developmental changes in barn owls under various conditions of monaural occlusion and showed that if an ear is occluded during the first two months of life, owls were able to recover normal localization accuracy while plugged (Mogdans and Knudsen, 1993; Brainard and Knudsen, 1995; Knudsen and Brainard, 1995; Miller and Knudsen, 2003; Bergan and Knudsen, 2007). When the plug was removed, owls showed large errors, but gradually recovered accurate localization (Knudsen et al., 1984). These behavioral changes are associated with significant remodeling of inferior colliculus circuits (for review, see (Knudsen, 2002)).\nKnudsen\u2019s experiments showed different sites and time constants for plasticity in the circuits for detecting ITDs and interaural level differences (Mogdans and Knudsen, 1993; Gold and Knudsen, 2000b). The first site of binaural interactions in the level difference pathway is the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (Manley et al., 1988; Mogdans and Knudsen, 1994). A monaural earplug inserted around a month after hatching led to plastic changes in this nucleus that mediated some of the adaptive changes in tuning observed at higher levels of the auditory pathway (Mogdans and Knudsen, 1992). In 1999, Gold developed a phase-shifting acoustic filtering device to examine the plasticity in the barn owl ITD pathway. Rearing with this device inserted monaurally caused remodeling of the projection from the central to external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (Gold and Knudsen, 2000a, 2000b). Gold analyzed the representation of ITD in normal and device-reared owls in the external nucleus, and the lateral shell of the central nucleus, its primary source of input. The external nucleus showed adaptive, frequency-\ndependent changes in ITD tuning, while lateral shell responses were unaffected by device rearing. When we raised young owls, using the Gold and Knudsen paradigm, and with device insertion from around P25, we also found no effect of altered auditory experience in the brainstem NL (K\u00f6ppl et al., 2012), consistent with Gold\u2019s findings. These results left unanswered the question of whether the brainstem representation of ITD could be modified by experience. Although the ear canals of younger owls were too small to fit the acoustic filtering device, we were able to induce a monaural conductive hearing loss beginning around P14-16 to reveal plasticity in the brainstem map of ITD. The extent of the shift, about 50 \u00b5s, was consistent with the assumed delay imposed by the earmold plugs on the acoustic stimulus (Knudsen et al., 1984). Thus, our data suggest that there are different critical periods for binaural integration in brainstem and midbrain.\nMultiple critical periods for binaural integration have been reported in other animal models (for reviews, see (Kumpik and King, 2019). In gerbil auditory cortex, monaural deprivation weakened the effect of inputs from the deprived ear and disrupted binaural integration. Effects were larger in auditory cortex than in the inferior colliculus (Popescu and Polley, 2010; Rosen et al., 2012; Polley et al., 2013; Mowery et al., 2015). In cortex, varying the age of hearing loss onset revealed brief critical periods for membrane and firing properties, as well as inhibitory synaptic currents. These critical periods closed 1 week after ear canal opening (Mowery et al., 2015). In the pallid bat, recordings from auditory cortex revealed different maturation rates for the inhibitory inputs that shape binaural responses (Razak and Fuzessery, 2007). In ferrets, unilateral conductive hearing loss produced long-lasting deficits in binaural hearing (Moore et al., 1999; Kumpik and King, 2019).\nWe differentiate between the effects of deafferentation and the monaural occlusion model of conductive hearing loss studied here. Rapid and dramatic neuron death occurs after removal of afferent input to the cochlear nucleus and has been carefully examined in both young mammals and birds (for review, see (Parks et al., 2004). Monaural occlusion has been studied in chicks (Tucci and Rubel, 1985), barn owls (Keuroghlian and Knudsen, 2007)and in mammals, principally in ferrets and gerbils (Moore and King, 2004; Moore, 2009; Popescu and Polley, 2010; Kral et al., 2013; Caras and Sanes, 2015; Sinclair et al., 2017; Rubio, 2020). In ferrets, like barn owls, monaural occlusion during infancy led to compensatory changes in auditory spatial tuning that tended to preserve the alignment between the neural representations of visual and auditory space. The key finding was that experience-induced plasticity allows the sound localization circuits to be customized to individual characteristics, such as the size and shape of the head and ears, and to compensate for natural conductive hearing losses, including those associated with middle ear disease in infancy (King et al., 2000).\nIn gerbils, monaural occlusion has well-defined effects upon the brainstem circuits for detection of ITD. Experiments with earplugs, monaural deafening and noise rearing in gerbils all support a role for experience dependent segregation of inhibition to medial superior olive cell bodies (Kapfer et al., 2002; Maier et al., 2008; Werthat et al., 2008; Sinclair et al., 2017). Recordings from the medial superior olive\u2019s target, the nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, related ITD sensitivity to the maturation of inhibitory inputs to the medial superior olive (Seidl and Grothe, 2005). Thus, both in vivo recordings from the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus and studies of the medial superior olive support a role for experiencedependent refinement in the medial superior olive in the first days after hearing onset."

            "text": "To understand the effects of conductive hearing loss, or other modifications of the external ear during development, it is important to know when animals can hear what. In both birds and mammals, auditory responses typically begin with a restricted range of low to mid-frequencies (Romand, 1979; Brugge, 1983; Arjmand et al., 1988; Rubel et al., 1988; Sarro and Sanes, 2010). In the progression to adult hearing, threshold development can be frequency dependent. In cats, high frequency thresholds reach adult levels before low frequencies (Walsh et al., 1986a), while gerbils show faster maturation at the\nmiddle frequencies, with low and high frequencies developing at similar but slower rates (McFadden et al., 1996). Rates of threshold maturation also differ, depending upon where the animal falls along the altricial to precocial spectrum. Some mammals, such as guinea pigs (Dum, 1984) and humans (review in (Werner, 2007), are born with functioning auditory systems and are considered precocial with respect to hearing. Other mammals, such as gerbils (McFadden et al., 1996), ferrets (Moore, 1982) and cats (Walsh et al., 1986a, 1986b), are considered deaf at birth and altricial with respect to hearing. This deafness is relative; closed ear canals in altricial animals muffle sounds, but loud sounds can activate the auditory system (Pujol and Hilding, 1973; Beatty, 1998; Wess et al., 2017).\nBirds show a low to high frequency pattern of auditory maturation (review in (Kubke and Carr, 2000, 2006). Precocial birds respond to sound in the egg (Konishi, 1973; Gray and Rubel, 1985; Jones and Jones, 1995; Sato and Momose-Sato, 2003; Mann and Kelley, 2011; Rivera et al., 2018) with adult-like thresholds to low and middle frequencies by the time of hatching, and sensitivity to higher frequencies continuing to improve after hatching (Saunders et al., 1973). Altricial birds, such as the barn owl (K\u00f6ppl and Nickel, 2007), budgerigar (Brittan-Powell and Dooling, 2004), and pied fly catcher (Aleksandrov and Dmitrieva, 1992) show similar patterns, except that the maturation occurs after hatching (for review, see (Bolhuis, 1991).\nWhen barn owl chicks hatch, they are insensitive to sound, and first show auditory responses to 1-2 kHz around P4-P7 (K\u00f6ppl and Nickel, 2007; Kraemer et al., 2017). Sensitivity to lower and higher frequencies increases with age, with responses to 12 kHz appearing as late as 2-3 months after hatching (there are small differences between the American Tyto furcata and European Tyto alba). Thus, these altricial birds achieve their sensitivity to sound during a prolonged period of development that coincides with the maturation of the skull and facial ruff (Haresign and Moiseff, 1988; Hausmann et al., 2010). The slow maturation of barn owl hearing allowed us to identify a critical period for auditory experience in the nucleus laminaris; we were able to insert an earmold plug when the young owls could hear frequencies up to 1-5 kHz (about 2 weeks after hatching) but were insensitive to sounds of higher frequency, which mature later, at 1-2 month for 8 kHz (K\u00f6ppl and Nickel, 2007; Kraemer et al., 2017). Since maps of ITD were only shifted in regions of NL with best frequencies above about 5 kHz, this suggests that experience is required for final maturation of the ITD circuit. These findings are consistent with the studies of the development of phase locking in the barn owl\u2019s auditory nerve, in which phase locking emerges at about the same time as frequency tuning, and and over a prolonged period of time. There are also strong parallels with results from the work on the gerbil brainstem discussed above, where activity dependent refinement occurs in the first days after hearing onset. Delays in maturation with white noise exposure suggest that not only activity, but patterned activity, is required (Seidl and Grothe, 2005)."

            "text": "Our data suggest that the axonal delay-line inputs to NL are plastic within a narrow time window around the onset of normal auditory experience, and furthermore, that the effects of monaural manipulation of acoustic experience appear to be predominantly ipsilateral. We had predicted that an acoustic delay caused by conductive hearing loss in one ear might be compensated for by an advance in neural conduction delay in the inputs to NL. We reasoned that these \u201cfaster\u201d inputs could be detected after ear insert removal by a change in the ITD map, as a downward shift of the location of 0\u00b5s best ITD in the ipsilateral map, and a matching upward shift on the contralateral side. The results were more complex than predicted. Only those parts of NL that would respond to frequencies that the owl could not hear at the time of plug insertion appeared to be plastic. Furthermore, only the ITD maps in the NL ipsilateral to the manipulated ear changed. One possible explanation for the prominence of ipsilateral changes is that ipsilateral conduction times may be more readily adjusted by shortening axonal projections or thickening myelination, for example. In contrast, speeding up of the contralateral projection from the plugged side might be harder because the contralateral axons are already thicker and faster to compensate the longer\ndistance than the ipsilateral projection (Seidl ref). Similar ipsilateral effects were observed in the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus on the side ipsilateral to the earplug, in barn owls raised with a unilateral earplug (Mogdans and Knudsen 1992).\nIdentification of the mechanisms underlying modification of ITD circuits will require future study. Our analyses did not reveal misaligned frequency tuning (Shamma et al., 1989; Pena et al., 2001; Carr et al., 2009; Plau\u0161ka et al., 2017), which suggest that stereausis does not underlie the shift in best ITD. The effect of side suggests the action of both or either of two mechanisms previously observed in gerbils: altered inhibition and changes in myelination. Gerbils show local and experience dependent change in myelination and conduction velocity of inputs to the superior olive (Lehnert et al., 2014; Ford et al., 2015; Sinclair et al., 2017; Stange-Marten et al., 2017; Dutta et al., 2018), and similar mechanisms may apply to the developing barn owl circuit. For example, myelination in the barn owl NL peaks at the third week posthatch, and myelinating oligodendrocyte density approaches adult levels by one month, when the head reaches its adult width (Cheng and Carr, 2007).\nChanges in inhibition could also potentially compensate for the small phase delays measured in the barn owl NL. In mammals, the mammalian medial superior olive receives predominantly glycinergic input from the nucleus of the trapezoid body that acts to shift ITD toward the contralateral hemisphere (Brand et al., 2002; Kapfer et al., 2002; Seidl and Grothe, 2005; Pecka et al., 2008; Franken et al., 2015; Beiderbeck et al., 2018; Winters and Golding, 2018). Similar circuits are found in birds, and NL receives inhibitory input from the ipsilateral superior olive (Carr et al., 1989; Fujita and Konishi, 1991; Burger et al., 2011). Glycine and GABA are co-expressed in avian brainstem auditory nuclei (Kuo et al., 2009; Coleman et al., 2011; Fischl et al., 2014), although neither GABA nor glycine have been implicated in shifts in ITD tuning so far. Instead, inhibition has been linked to the quality of such tuning (Gr\u00fcn et al., 1992; Pena et al., 1996; Nishino et al., 2008). GABAergic inputs act upon both laminaris neurons and on their inputs from the first order nucleus magnocellularis, apparently to maintain dynamic range, and sharpen the coincidence window in laminaris neurons (Gr\u00fcn et al., 1992; Hyson et al., 1995; Pena et al., 1996; Funabiki et al., 1998; Lu et al., 2005; Burger and Rubel, 2008; Nishino et al., 2008; Fukui et al., 2010; Burger et al., 2011; Coleman et al., 2011; Fischl et al., 2012; Yamada et al., 2013; Hamlet et al., 2014; Carroll and Hyson, 2016). In chickens, inputs from local inhibitory GABAergic neurons have also been shown to improve ITD-tuning over a wide range of excitatory levels (Nishino et al., 2008; Yamada et al., 2013). Existing circuits allow for monaural effects; the superior olivary nuclei mutually inhibit each other, at least in the chicken (Burger et al., 2005). Thus, loud sounds in one ear should increase inhibition on the ipsilateral side and decrease inhibition on the contralateral side and potentially alter response latency (Burger et al., 2011)."

Exemplar ITD sensitive recordings through lhs (plug side) NL show a shift in best ITD from contralateral to frontal ITDs with recording electrode depth in a dorso-ventral series, as shown by increasing shades of blue (light blue most dorsal recording at 10,100 \u00b5m, thick line closest to 0\u00b5s best ITD, darkest line most ventral recording at 10,600\u00b5m depth). Neurophonic responses in NL were evoked by binaural tones (5.6 kHz) that varied in ITD, and ITD-sensitive responses were recorded only within NL.\nB. Exemplar lesions from penetrations through lhs and rhs NL: Lesions mark 0-\u00b5s best ITD. Nissl stained transverse 40\u00b5m section at the level of central NL. The dorsal (at the top) and ventral (at the bottom) borders of NL are outlined by a glial border that surrounds NL, with the tracts made up of NM axons above and below the borders. There are lesions on both sides in central NL at ITD 0\u00b5s, 46% along the tonotopic axis, and 18% up from the ventral edge of NL (lhs, black-ringed symbol in C) and 44% along tonotopic axis and 24% from the ventral edge (rhs, black-center symbol in D). Scale bar=1000\u00b5m.\nC. Locations of lesions in NL revealed a systematic shift in the mapping of frontal space, around 0 \u00b5s best ITD (dashed line shows normal data from (Carr et al., 2015)), in NL ipsilateral to the earmold plug. Each data point marks the dorso-ventral and isofrequency axis coordinates of a 0 \u00b5s best ITD recording site. The depth of lesions marking 0 \u03bcs best ITD in NL increased with increasingly lateral position along an isofrequency band. Blue symbol colors denote recordings from regions of NL with best frequencies\nbelow 5 kHz, and green symbols recordings above 5 kHz. Note C and D share a common x-axis, marked as % iso-frequency axis. Regression line colors match symbol color.\nD. Location of lesions in NL contralateral to the earmold plug. Blue symbol color denotes recordings from regions of NL with best frequencies \u2264 5 kHz, and green symbols recordings > 5 kHz. Note C and D share a common x-axis, marked as % position along iso-frequency band. Regression line colors match symbol color.\nFigure 4. Plug effects on the strength of the inputs to NL.\nA. Diagram of earmold plug placement in the left ear, with schematic transverse section through the brainstem showing left (plug) ear inputs in red to the nucleus magnocellularis (NM). NM projects to both ipsilateral (red) NL and to the contralateral (magenta) NL. The right hand ear inputs are shown in blue to the right NM. Right NM projects to ipsilateral (blue) NL, and to contralateral (cyan) NL. Color codes are maintained in the figure to faciliate comparisons, and filled symbols show inputs from plug side ear.\nB. Exemplar iso-level neurophonic response curves to stimulation of the ipsi (blue) and contralateral (magenta) ear, with SNR (dashed lines) computed from each recording (SNRmax of 18.16 for this example). The notation Rbrain Rstimulus and Rbrain Lstimulus refers to brainstem side of the recordings and stimulus location.\nC. SNRmax for all BF responses recorded on both left (plug) and right sides of the brain. Responses to stimuli that were ipsilateral to the earmold plug use filled symbols, (LL, RL). Responses to stimulation of the right ear use open symbols, RR, LR.) Dashed line divides plot by frequency into low (below 5 kHz) and high frequency responses (above 5 kHz).\nD. Box plots of the same SNRmax data as in C, for both low and high (>5 kHz) best frequency populations, including age-matched controls (grey), on plug (filled symbols) and no plug (open symbols) brain side. Same color code as in A, C. For pairwise comparisons for low best frequency regions, * show LL significantly different to RR, p<0.005. For high best frequency regions on NL, * show significantly different control vs. LL (p<0.0001), plug LL vs. plug LR (p<0.001), plug LL vs. RL (p<0.018), and plug LL vs RR (p<0.0001).\nE. Comparison of estimated marginal means computed from linear mixed model analysis of all neurophonic SNRmax data from animals with earmold plugs and age-matched controls revealed that, for recordings with best frequencies \u22645 kHz, SNRmax of NL neurophonics evoked by ipsilateral stimulation on the plugged side (\u201cplug ipsi\u201d in lower panel), were significantly different to those evoked by contralateral stimulation on the unplugged side. Confidence intervals for estimated marginal means are indicated by blue bars; pairwise comparisons are shown as red arrows with significant differences between groups indicated by non-overlapping arrows.\nFigure 5. ITD responses on both sides of the brain.\nA. Mean power spectral density (PSD) of the driven response in B, for recording from the unmanipulated side. PSD based on activity 15\u201395 ms after the onset of the tone, and shows the PSD at best and worst ITDs. Note the large \u201csignal\" peak (0.011 mV^2/kHz) at the stimulus frequency for the favorable ITD (arrow at 6.1 kHz) and the average spectra level around the peak (\u201cnoise\u201d: 7*10^-5 mV^2/kHz ). For the PSD of the response to unfavorable ITD the signal peak height was 11*10^-5 mV^2/kHz and the noise level was 3*10^-5 mV^2/kHz.\nB. Exemplar neurophonic ITD curve with best-frequency tones as the stimulus, on the unmanipulated side. Response was obtained from the variance of the sustained activity (onset excluded) \u00b1 SE across trials, where 100% corresponds to 0.79 mV^2 in this example (dashed line). The SNR (blue line) is based\non the signal and noise levels of the response PSDs to respective stimulus ITDs, maximum SNR corresponds to 22.4 dB. Stimulation at 50 dB SPL; stimulus frequency 6.1 kHz.\nC. Mean PSD of the driven response in D, for recording from the side ipsilateral to the plug; note the large signal peak (0.78 mV^2/kHz) at the stimulus frequency for the favorable ITD (arrow at 5.8 kHz) and the average spectra level around the peak (\u201cnoise\u201d: 6*10^-4 mV^2/kHz for the favorable ITD). For the PSD of the response to unfavorable ITD the signal peak height was 8*10^-4 mV^2/kHz and the noise level was 3*10^-4 mV^2/kHz.\nD. Exemplar neurophonic ITD curve with best-frequency tones as the stimulus in NL contralateral to the plugged ear. Response was obtained from the variance of the sustained activity (onset excluded) \u00b1 SE across trials, where 100% corresponds to 6.30 mV^2 in this example (dashed line). The maximum SNR (red line) corresponds to 21.1 dB. Stimulation at 50 dB SPL; stimulus frequency 5.8 kHz.\nE. SNR values for all ITD-sensitive neurophonic recordings from animals raised with an earmold plug, separated according to brainstem side relative to the manipulated ear (ipsilateral, red circles and contralateral, blue circles). Age-matched control measures of SNR in NL are also shown (open grey circles). Vertical line marks border between high (>5kHz) and low best frequency regions of NL.\nF. Box and whisker plots of all SNR values computed from ITD-sensitive neurophonic responses from animals raised with a monaural earmold plug (plug side and opposite side), and age-matched controls.\nG. Comparison of estimated marginal means for the main effects of side and BF-population on SNRmax, derived from linear mixed-effects modeling. Confidence intervals for estimated marginal means are represented as blue bars; red arrows indicate pairwise comparisons between groups where overlap of arrows indicates statistical non-significance.\nH. Difference (in octaves) in best frequency for neurophonic responses to monaural ipsi- or contralateral stimulation, separately for NL on plug side and side with no plug, for all recordings, with age matched controls. Positive difference corresponds to BF (ipsi) > BF(contra).\nH*. Cross-correlation of ipsilateral and contralateral SNR peaks did not predict the difference in best ITD.\nFigure 6.\nA. Example of a lesion used to identify the location of responses to 0\u00b5s best ITD. Nissl-stained top half of rhs brainstem, showing NL, NM, nucleus angularis (NA), and the incoming auditory-nerve tract (N8) . Asterisk marks a lesion near the ventrolateral edge of NL (95% along isofrequency band). Scale bar = 1000 \u03bcm.\nB. Recorded ITD maps were not different to the normal maps in Carr et al. 2015 (solid line). ANCOVA with a z-test for slopes showed that the slopes were not different (p=0.3). A z-test for slopes yielded a p value of 0.64, thus the y-intercepts for the two ITD maps were not statistically different. Neither were they different to the normal map (p=0.696). Regression for line ipsilateral to the device y=-0.503x+0.57, R2=0.39. Regression contralateral to device y=-0.343+0.578, R2=0.08."
