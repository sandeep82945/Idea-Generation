    "abstractText": "The increased discharge of water pollutants drives the development of new and effective wastewater remediation methods. Herein, a magnetic nanocomposite of chitosan-graphene oxide (GO) decorated with copper ferrite (MCSGO) was synthesized under ultrasound agitation and applied to the effective removal of Safranin O (SAF) and indigo carmine (IC) dyes from wastewater. The structural, magnetic, and physicochemical features of the as-prepared MCSGO nanocomposite have been thoroughly investigated using various characterization techniques. The operational parameters such as MCSGO mass, contact time, pH, and initial dye concentration were investigated. The effects of diverse coexisting species on both dye elimination processes were examined. The experimental results demonstrated that the adsorption capacity of MCSGO nanocomposite for IC and SAF was 112.6 and 66.15 mg g\u22121, respectively. Five different adsorption isotherms were investigated using two-parameter (Langmuir, Tekman, and Freundlich) and three-parameter (Sips, and Redlich\u2013Peterson) models. Thermodynamic studies revealed that the elimination of both dyes on MCSGO nanocomposite was endothermic and spontaneous, with anionic and cationic dye molecules randomly arranged onto the adsorbent nanoparticles. Moreover, the mechanism of dye elimination was deduced. Furthermore, even after five cycles of adsorption and desorption, the as-prepared nanocomposite showed no significant loss in the dye removal efficiency, indicating that it has superior stability and recycling potential.",

Chitosan (CS) is a biopolymer that is abundant in nature and is relatively cheap. Because of its biodegradability, superior antibacterial, bioactivity, anticancer, antimicrobial, antifungal actions, and biocompatibility, as well as its ability to strengthen the immune system, CS has received a lot of attention.16,17 Due to its distinctive properties, chitosan has been applied in various elds such as membrane separation, delivery systems, wound healing, wastewater treatment, and food packaging.16 Chitosan shows great adsorption ability for several types of pollutants due to the presence of its numerous hydroxyl and amino functional groups.18 Nevertheless, CS exhibit limited mechanical features and thermal stability, but these features can be promoted by impregnating CS with GO. The chitosan can be utilized as an immobilization matrix for GO, where the \u2013OH and \u2013NH2 of chitosan can participate in hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions with the surface groups of GO.19 The combination of GO and chitosan is obviously benecial with an enhancement in the thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of chitosan, as well as stabilizing the GO sheets and reducing their tendency to aggregate.20 The recovery of the solid adsorbent aer the pollutant's removal process is one of the prime challenges in the application of sorbents. By anchoring magnetic NPs into solid sorbents, the separation and selective pollutant's removal can be achieved even in the presence of other solids.21 Due to their chemical, magnetic, and thermal features, spinel ferrites NPs are oen utilized as magnetic supports for adsorbents.22 Among these spinal ferrites, CuFe2O4 has attracted substantial applied and fundamental research attention due to its numerous uses in electronics, sensors, and catalysts. In this study, we synthesized CS/GO nanocomposite and decorated it with copper ferrite magnetic NPs in one step via ultrasonic agitation and applied the as-prepared magnetic CuFe2O4/CS/GO to eliminate anionic and cationic dyes. To explore the structure and morphology of the composite sorbent materials, various spectroscopic and surface characterization techniques were applied, including XRD, BET, SEM, TEM, and FTIR. The key factors governing the dyes sorption were carefully assessed and optimized for the efficient dyes removal from wastewater. The impact of coexisting pollutants on dye elimination efficiency was investigated. Five adsorption isotherms were studied using two-parameter (Langmuir, Tekman, and Freundlich) and three-parameter (Sips, and Redlich\u2013Peterson) models. The kinetics and thermodynamics were thoroughly investigated to elucidate the rates, and nature of dye removals onto the MCSGO. The mechanism of dye removal onto MCSGO nanocomposite was elucidated."

The concentration of sorbate pollutants played a fundamental role as a xed weight of the MCSGO nanocomposite sorbent can eliminate a maximum xed amount of sorbate dye. The effect of the initial concentrations of anionic (IC) and cationic (SAF) dyes were studied using a 100 ml dye solution containing 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 to 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 M and determining the adsorption capacity of IC and SAF onto the MCSGO nanocomposite. The obtained results demonstrated that the adsorption capacity increased as the initial dye concentration increased,28 as shown in Fig. 7a. Higher dye concentrations result in greater removal capabilities driven by the reduced resistance of dye molecules transfer from the solution to the active adsorption sites of the MCSGO nanocomposite3 Nevertheless, the % removal is reduced due to the consumption of unoccupied sites by the dye molecules.\n3.2.2 Effect of MCSGO adsorbent mass. To examine the effect of the MCSGO mass on IC and SAF dyes' elimination efficiency, the adsorbent mass was increased from 0.01 to 0.04 g per 100 ml of the dye solution while maintaining other experimental parameters constant, Fig. 7b.

That enhancement in elimination efficiency of IC and SAF with the rise of the adsorbent mass is ascribed to the present abundance of the vacant sites and functional groups on the surfaces of MCSGO nanocomposite particles.4 A nonlinear enhancement in the percentage of elimination with increasing composite mass may be because of agglomeration of composite particles or a low number of dye molecules medium.\n3.2.3 Effect of pH on dye removal efficiency. The surface charge of MCSGO adsorbent and the structures of dye molecules are affected by the solution pH, which is a key factor controlling the adsorption mechanism.26 The zeta potential value has been determined at diverse points in the range of 2.0\u2013 10.0 as displayed in Fig. 8a. The isoelectric point (IEP) of the MCSGO composite is 3.8, which means that the MCSGO surface does not bear any electric charge at that point, while the surface becomes negatively charged at pH points higher than the IEP and positively charged when the pH of the medium is less than the IEP.4 As shown in Fig. 8b, the maximum removal was\n5342 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 5337\u20135352\nobserved at pH 7.0 for SAF (88.13%) and pH 3 for IC dye (87.86%). For the SAF dye, there was a gradual reduction in the removal efficiency of the dye with a decrease in the pH value. This is due to the repulsion between the positive surface of the MCSGO and the cationic dye molecule.28 Also, in an acidic medium, an excessive amount of H+ surrounding the surface of the compound increases their competitions with SAF, which in turn decreases the uptake of the dye.29 Furthermore, the removal of the cationic SAF dye at low pH values can be ascribed to the hydrogen bonding and p\u2013p interactions.30 When the medium becomes more alkaline, the removal of the SAF dye shows a corresponding increase. This is related to the signicant electrostatic attraction among the positively charged nitrogen of the SAF dye with the deprotonated groups on the MCSGO surface as well as the p\u2013p force.11 In contrast, the removal efficiency of IC dye is signicantly enhanced at low pH values. The electrostatic forces that occur at low pH values between the negatively charged dye and MCSGO can be attributed to the presence of protons of GO surface groups, or amido groups in MCSGO that resulted from the interaction of amino\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

However, the decrease in removal efficiency with increasing pH value can be assigned to the repulsion force between similarly charged groups.\n3.2.4 Effect of coexisting species. Effluents of dyeing processes contain different substances such as surfactants as a model organic pollutant and dissolved salts like NaCl that are common coexisting species. The presence of these substances may affect the efficiency of dyes removal using the MCSGO nanocomposite. Therefore, we examined the effects of NaCl and SDS on the elimination efficiency of SAF and IC dyes using the MCSGO adsorbent. Fig. 9a and b show the effects of the presence of 0\u20131000 ppm NaCl and 0\u201320 ppm SDS on the SAF and IC dye elimination efficiency using the MCSGO adsorbent. It can be noticed that the elimination efficiency of SAF dye is unaffected by the addition of the electrolyte. Furthermore, higher concentrations of the electrolyte exhibited a slight effect on the removal efficiency of IC dye, Fig. 9a. On the other hand, the addition of SDS had no effect on the removal of SAF dye; however, the observed slight decrease in the elimination efficiency of IC dye (Fig. 9b) was attributed to the competition of the anionic SDS head groups with the anionic IC molecules towards the active adsorption sites of MCSGO adsorbent.\n3.2.5 Adsorption performance in binary system of dyes. In practice, wastewaters frequently contain mixtures of several dyes; therefore, the adsorptive removal of mixtures of IC anionic and SAF cationic dyes were examined at the optimum pH values of 3.0 and 7.0, respectively. Images of dye solutions before and aer mixing and the UV-vis spectral data before and aer the adsorptive removal process are shown in Fig. 10a\u2013e. The UV spectra of Fig. 10d showed that at pH 3.0, the MCSGO\nFig. 10 (a, b, and c) Optical images and (d and e) UV-vis spectra of the m MCSGO adsorbent.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

These results revealed that the presence of more than one dye does not affect the adsorption features of the prepared nanocomposite. However, the selectivity and efficiency in removing dye pollutants are governed by the solution pH, as explained in section 3.2.3."

This model is a combined form of Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms and is more appropriate to elucidate the adsorption operation on surfaces of heterogeneous nature.

The value of R2 of the nonlinear plot for the removal of IC and SAF dye onto MCSGO is 0.985, and 0.984, respectively; reecting that the model is suitable to describe the adsorption operation.

At large concentrations, the R\u2013P model approach that of Freundlich while at low concentrations it approaches the Henry's law. It incorporates elements of the Freundlich and Langmuir equations; hence the removal mechanism is a combination, as it varies from the ideal to the multilayer adsorption behavior.

The bR is an exponent that ranges from 0 to 1. Thus, if the value of bR is outside 0\u20131, the data will not be adequately explained by the R\u2013P equation. The ratio of KR/aR reects the adsorption capacity. The R\u2013P isotherm parameters are shown in the Table 1.

Various kinetic models are commonly applied to adsorptive removal processes, including the pseudo-rst-order (PFO), pseudo-second-order (PSO), intraparticle diffusion (IPD), and Elovich models.\n3.4.1 Pseudo rst order (PFO) and pseudo second order) PSO). The contact time is a critical parameter in the adsorption process, where quick elimination of pollutants and attainment of equilibrium in a short time display the adsorbent efficiency in eliminating the studied pollutants.4 The effect of time on the uptake of SAF and IC dyes by MCSGO NPs is illustrated in Fig. 12a and b, respectively. It was observed that the elimination of dyes was quick in the rst ten minutes and reached equilibrium aer 60 and 100 minutes for IC and SAF, respectively. The fast dye removal at the initial stage of the adsorption process can be assigned to the presence of several vacant sites distributed over the nanocomposite surfaces. However, in the last stage of the adsorption process, the rate of dye removal becomes much slower,33 probably due to the signicant reduction in the number of vacant sites on the surfaces of MCSGO NPs and/or the agglomeration of these particles.3 The obtained adsorption data of IC and SAF dyes onto the MCSGO nanocomposite were tted, Fig. 12c and d, according to the PFO and PSO models, respectively. It was observed that the R2 values of the PFO tting had small values, Table 2, demonstrating that this kinetic model cannot be applied to explain the dyes elimination process.4 Nevertheless, the qm values estimated from PSO graphs, Fig. 12e and f, for the elimination of both IC and SAF dyes were very close to the experimental qm values. Moreover, the high R2 values demonstrated that the PSO kinetic model was predominant, and controlled the adsorptive removal of IC and SAF dyes onto the MCSGO nanocomposite. These ndings show that the dye elimination occurred rst through lm diffusion, then through a gradual progression of the adsorption process, and nally reached equilibrium.26\n3.4.2 Intraparticle diffusion (IPD). In order to better understand how sorbate molecules are transported from solution to the adsorbent surfaces, Weber Morris developed the intraparticle diffusion model (IPD),34 eqn (7):\nqe = kidt 0.5 + C (7)\nWhere C (mg g\u22121) is the intercept and gives details about the boundary layer thickness, Kid is the rate constant of intraparticle diffusion (mg g\u22121 min\u22121/2). Thus, multi-linear graphs were obtained, Fig. 13a and b, for the adsorption of IC and SAF dyes on MCSGOnanocomposite demonstrating thatmore than one single mechanism inuenced the dye removal process. The sharper parts of the plots can be attributed to the external diffusion of dyes from the bulk of the solution to the surfaces of MCSGO NPs. The other linear part is attributed to the diffusion of dyes deep into the MCSGO NPs. The values of Kid and C demonstrated that intraparticle diffusion and lm diffusion took place independently, with appreciable participation of lm diffusion.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 5337\u20135352 | 5345\nFig. 12 Effect of contact time for the removal of (a) IC dye, and (b) SAF dye; PFO plots for the removal of (c) IC dye; and (d) SAF dye, and PSO plots for the removal of (e) IC dye, and (f) SAF dye.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The felicitous preparation of MCSGO composite was ascertained by various techniques including XRD, SEM, EDX, HRTEM, SAED, VSM, FTIR, BET and zeta potential studies. The morphological analysis of the MCSGO composite displayed that copper ferrite NPs were felicitously anchored on CS/GO hybrid sheets. Experimental data demonstrated that the removal of IC and SAF dyes was signicantly improved with increasing the contact time, initial dye concentration, and adsorbent mass. The removal efficiency of dyes was not signicantly affected by the presence of coexisting materials of NaCl and SDS, while the selectivity of dyes removal depends on the pH value of the solution. The elimination of dyes on MCSGO essentially follows the Langmuir model demonstrating monolayer formation on the surface of MCSGO. Furthermore, the removal kinetics followed the PSO mechanism. Both intraparticle diffusion and lm formation were also involved in the dye removal process. The obtained values of thermodynamic parameters demonstrated that dyes' removal was endothermic as well as a random arrangement of dye molecules on MCSGO surfaces. FTIR analyses give information on main functional groups and bonds in the MCSGO composite, demonstrating that surface groups and aromatic structures participate in dyes elimination through electrostatic interaction, p\u2013p interactions and H-bonding.
