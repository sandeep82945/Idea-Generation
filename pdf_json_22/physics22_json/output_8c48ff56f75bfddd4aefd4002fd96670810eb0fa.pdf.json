    "abstractText": "7 The large-scale evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been marked by rapid turnover of genetic 8 clades. New variants show intrinsic changes, notably increased transmissibility, as well as anti9 genic changes that reduce the cross-immunity induced by previous infections or vaccinations 1\u20134. 10 How this functional variation shapes the global evolutionary dynamics has remained unclear. 11 Here we show that selection induced by vaccination impacts on the recent antigenic evolution 12 of SARS-CoV-2; other relevant forces include intrinsic selection and antigenic selection induced 13 by previous infections. We obtain these results from a fitness model with intrinsic and antigenic 14 fitness components. To infer model parameters, we combine time-resolved sequence data 5, epi15 demiological records 6,7, and cross-neutralisation assays 8\u201310. This model accurately captures the 16 large-scale evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in multiple geographical regions. In partic17 ular, it quantifies how recent vaccinations and infections affect the speed of frequency shifts 18 between viral variants. Our results show that timely neutralisation data can be harvested to 19 identify hotspots of antigenic selection and to predict the impact of vaccination on viral evolu20 tion. 21",

            "text": "The large-scale evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been marked by rapid turnover of genetic8 clades. New variants show intrinsic changes, notably increased transmissibility, as well as anti-9 genic changes that reduce the cross-immunity induced by previous infections or vaccinations 1\u20134.10 How this functional variation shapes the global evolutionary dynamics has remained unclear.11 Here we show that selection induced by vaccination impacts on the recent antigenic evolution12 of SARS-CoV-2; other relevant forces include intrinsic selection and antigenic selection induced13 by previous infections. We obtain these results from a fitness model with intrinsic and antigenic14 fitness components. To infer model parameters, we combine time-resolved sequence data 5, epi-15 demiological records 6,7, and cross-neutralisation assays 8\u201310. This model accurately captures the16 large-scale evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in multiple geographical regions. In partic-17 ular, it quantifies how recent vaccinations and infections affect the speed of frequency shifts18 between viral variants. Our results show that timely neutralisation data can be harvested to19 identify hotspots of antigenic selection and to predict the impact of vaccination on viral evolu-20 tion.21\nIntroduction22\nTwo classes of molecular adaptation have been observed in the evolution of SARS-CoV-223 to date. Multiple mutations carry intrinsic changes of viral functions, such as increasing the24 binding affinity to human receptors 1, the efficiency of cell entry 2,3, or the stability of viral25 proteins 11,12. Other mutations, referred to as antigenic changes, decrease the neutralizing ac-26 tivity of human antibodies 4,8\u201310, thereby reducing the immune protection against secondary27 infections 13,14. The strains that inherit a given mutation define a clade of the evolving viral28 population. Several of these molecular changes had drastic evolutionary and epidemiological29 impact, inducing global turnover of viral clades and concurrent waves of the pandemic. Over30 the last two years, three genetic variants and their associated clades successively gained global31 prevalence: Alpha (\u03b1) from March to June in 2021, Delta (\u03b4) from June to December in 202132 and Omicron (o) in 2022. These were named Variants of Concern (VOCs) by the World Health33 Organization 15; other VOCs gained temporary regional prevalence. Several studies reported fit-34 ness advantages of VOCs inferred from epidemiological trajectories and comparative functional35 studies 3,16\u201319. Importantly, however, the evolutionary impact of antigenic changes is time-36 dependent, because it depends on previously acquired population immunity: a larger amount of37 previous infections or vaccinations increases the global fitness advantage of an antigenic escape38 mutation. Specifically, multi-strain epidemiological models and simulations suggest that vacci-39 nations can favour the emergence of escape variants 20\u201323 and influence the turnover of circulating40 clades 24,25; effects of this kind have been reported for some clades of human influenza 26. In41 the case of SARS-CoV-2, pandemic infection and massive vaccination programs, with a global42 count of 4.5 billion vaccinations and >200 million confirmed cases in 2021 6, have built up partial43 population immunity, but its feedback on viral evolution has not been quantified. This leads to44\nthe central question of this paper: what is the impact of vaccination and infection rates on the45 turnover of SARS-CoV-2 clades? To address this question, we infer a data-driven fitness model46 for SARS-CoV-2 variants with distinct components of intrinsic fitness and antigenic fitness by47 vaccination and infection.48\nResults49\nTrajectories and speed of clade turnover As a first step, we map the evolutionary trajec-50 tories of the three global clade shifts in the last two years. To track circulating clades, we analyse51 a set of >5M quality-controlled SARS-CoV-2 sequences obtained from the GISAID database 5.52 We assign these sequences to genetic clades using a standard set of amino acid changes 27; then53 we infer time-dependent clade frequencies from strain counts smoothened over a period of \u223c3054 days (Methods). To obtain accurate, time-resolved data, we record frequency trajectories at the55 level of regions (countries and US states). Including all regions satisfying uniform criteria of56 data availability (Methods), we obtain frequency trajectories of the 1\u2212\u03b1, the \u03b1\u2212\u03b4, and the \u03b4\u2212o57 shift for 11, 16, and 14 regions, respectively. Here, 1 denotes the set of clades circulating prior58 to \u03b1, including the wild type (wt) and the early 614G mutation in the spike protein. Fig. 1a59 shows trajectories of the ancestral and the invading clade for the \u03b1\u2212 \u03b4 and \u03b4\u2212 o shifts in Italy;60 trajectories for all regions of this study are reported in Fig. S1 and S2.61\nAssuming that large-scale frequency shifts of viral clades are adaptive processes, we can62 infer the underlying selective force from frequency trajectories. Specifically, the fitness difference63 (selection coefficient) between invading and ancestral clades takes the form64\ns\u0302(t) = d\ndt log\nxinv(t) xanc(t) , (1)\nwhere xinv(t) and xanc(t) are the corresponding frequencies (here and below, empirical selection65 coefficients inferred from frequency trajectories are marked by a hat). We note that this relation66 is independent of other co-circulating clades (Methods). In Fig. 1b, we show time-resolved,67 regional selection coefficients of the invading and ancestral clade for the \u03b1\u2212 \u03b4 and \u03b4 \u2212 o shifts.68 These data reveal two opposing trends: During the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4 shift, selection increases with time69 in 16 of 16 regions. Conversely, selection driving the \u03b4 \u2212 o shift decreases with time in 12 of70 14 regions. Compared to a reference of time-independent selection, the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4 shift runs at an71 accelerating speed, the \u03b4 \u2212 o shift at a decelerating speed. The time dependence of selection72 is statistically significant (P < 10\u221215 for \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4, P < 10\u22125 for \u03b4 \u2212 o; two-sided Wald test). In73 contrast, the earlier 1 \u2212 \u03b1 shift does not show a significant signal of time-dependent selection74 (P > 0.01, Fig. S3). In what follows, we will relate this pattern to feedback of vaccination on75 viral evolution.76\nCross-immunity trajectories Cross-immunity induced by a primary infection against subse-77 quent infections by related pathogens is routinely tested by neutralisation assays, which measure78 the minimum antiserum concentration required to neutralise the second antigen. Relative, in-79 verse concentrations are reported as serum dilution titers; here we use logarithmic titer values,80 T (with base 2). For SARS-CoV-2, recent work 8\u201310,28,29 has established a matrix of titers, T ki ,81 measuring neutralisation of variant i in immune channel k (Fig. 2a, Table S1). Here and below,82 immune channels label primary challenges inducing specific antisera, including infections by dif-83 ferent variants (k = \u03b1, \u03b4, o, . . . ), as well as primary and booster vaccinations (k = vac, bst; titers84 shown here are for mRNA vaccines). Together, these data provide a first, coarse-grained cross-85 immunity landscape of SARS-CoV-2. Infection-induced cross-immunity titers are maximal when86 primary infection and secondary challenge are by the same variant (Fig. 2a). Similarly, titers in-87 duced by primary vaccination, T vaci , are maximal against strains from the ancestral clade, which88 contains the strain used for vaccination 30. Differences of neutralisation titers, \u2206T kij = T k i \u2212 T kj ,89\nmeasure differences in functional antibody binding between strains of different variants; evolved90 titer reductions are also referred to as antigenic advance. Notably, each of the global clade shifts91 observed to date, 1 \u2212 \u03b1, \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4, and \u03b4 \u2212 o, has decreased neutralisation by vaccination, i.e.,92 generated antigenic advance, \u2206T vac1\u03b1 ,\u2206T vac \u03b1\u03b4 ,\u2206T vac \u03b4o > 0 (Fig. 2b). Moreover, the in-vivo concen-93 tration of neutralising antibodies decays exponentially with time after immunisation 31,32. This94\ntranslates into a linear titer reduction, T ki (\u2206t) = T k i \u2212\u2206t/\u03c4 , with an estimated half life \u03c4 \u223c 6595 days (Methods).96\nImportantly, recent work for SARS-CoV-2 has also shown that neutralisation titers predict97 the cross-immunity cki , defined as the relative drop of secondary infections in human cohorts.98 Specifically, cki = H(T k i ) is a Hill function\n13,14 (Fig. 2c, details are given in Methods), consistent99 with the underlying biophysics of antibody-antigen binding and with results for other viral100 pathogens 33\u201336. The post-immunisation decay of antibody concentration induces a decay of101 cross-immunity, cki (\u2206t) = H(T k i \u2212 \u2206t/\u03c4). Together, cross-immunity depends in a predictable,102 nonlinear way on neutralisation titer and on time since primary immunisation. Fig. 2 shows two103 examples of this pattern. Primary infection by an \u03b1 strain induces a high cross-immunity against104 other \u03b1 strains and a reduced cross-immunity against \u03b4 strains (c\u03b1\u03b1 > c \u03b1 \u03b4 ) (Fig. 2c, top). Both105 factors decrease by antibody decay; their difference has a maximum at an intermediate time106 since primary infection (Fig. 2d, top). Infection by a \u03b4 strain induces cross-immunity factors of107 opposite ranking (c\u03b1\u03b4 < c \u03b4 \u03b4) and similar decay (Fig. 2cd, bottom).108 To track population immunity over time, we combine these cross-immunity factors with109 infection and vaccination data. In each region, we record cumulative fractions of immunised110 individuals, yk(t), in each channel k (clade-specific infections, primary and booster vaccinations;111 see Figs. S1 and S2). Their derivatives y\u0307k(t) are the rates of new immunisations in channel k.112 Clade-specific infection data are obtained by multiplying the total rate of new infections reported113 in each region with the simultaneous viral clade frequencies xk(t) (Fig. 1a). In the regions114 included in our analysis, vaccination has been predominantly by mRNA vaccines (Methods).115 By weighting with the time-dependent cross-immunity factors cki (\u2206t), we infer the population116\ncross-immunity against clade i by immunisation in channel k,117\nCki (t) = \u222b t cki (t\u2212 t\u2032) y\u0307k(t\u2032) dt\u2032. (2)\nIn Fig. 1c, we plot the cross-immunity trajectories relevant for the \u03b1\u2212\u03b4 and \u03b4\u2212o shifts in Italy;118 trajectories for all regions are reported in Figs. S1 and S2. The \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4 shift shows sizeable and119 increasing immunity induced by primary vaccination, while infection-induced immunity remains120 small. During the \u03b4 \u2212 o shift, immunity by primary vaccination declines, while booster- and121 infection-induced immunity components increase. During the earlier 1 \u2212 \u03b1 shift, population122 cross-immunity is still small in most regions. We conclude that the joint dynamics of new123 immunisations and antibody decay can produce complex and opposing cross-immunity patterns.124\nInference of intrinsic and antigenic selection To quantify the feedback of cross-immunity125 on viral evolution, we use a minimal, computable fitness model,126\nfi(t) = f 0 i \u2212 \u2211 k \u03b3kC k i (t), (3)\nwhere fi(t) is the absolute fitness, or epidemic growth rate, of a viral strain. Fitness is propor-127 tional to the log of the effective reproductive number, fi(t) = \u03c4 \u22121 0 logRi(t), where \u03c40 denotes128 the infectious period (Methods). Here, we write fitness as the sum of a time-independent in-129 trinsic component, f0i , and of time-dependent antigenic components, f k i (t) = \u2212\u03b3kCki (t) (Meth-130 ods). Each component is proportional to the corresponding cross-immunity factor Cki (t) with a131 weight factor \u03b3k for each immune channel k. Hence, selection is generated by cross-immunity132 differences between competing strains (shading in Fig. 1c and Fig. 2c). This type of fitness133 model has been established for predictive evolutionary analysis of human influenza 24,37,38 and134 is grounded in multi-strain epidemiological models 39. The minimal fitness model does not ac-135 count for differences in cross-immunity between human hosts (for example, through differences136 in immunodominance 40) and for correlations between multiple prior infections (antigenic sin 41).137\nFor SARS-CoV-2, we compute fitness at the level of variants, neglecting fitness differences be-138 tween strains within a clade. Similarly, we evaluate cross-immunity at the level of variant-specific139 prior infection and of primary and booster vaccination, using the trajectories Cki (t) calculated140 above (Fig. 1c). To compare model and data, we compute the fitness difference between invading141 and ancestral strain for each regional trajectory: s(t) = finv(t)\u2212 fanc(t) = s0 + sag(t), where in-142 trinsic selection, s0, and antigenic selection, sag(t) = \u2211 k sk(t), are given by equation (3). Then143 we decompose the model-based selection trajectories into mean and change, s(t) = \u3008s\u3009+ \u2206s(t)144 (brackets denote time averages over the trajectory for a given region). The empirical trajectories145 s\u0302(t) are decomposed in the same way (Fig. 1b). Cross-region selection differences, measured by146 the rms deviation of \u3008s\u0302\u3009, reflect inhomogeneous conditions of contact limitations, surveillance,147 geography, and population structure that are not included in the minimal model. In a given148 region, however, variants compete under more homogeneous conditions. Therefore, we infer149 antigenic selection from the regional selection change, \u2206s\u0302(t). We use a minimal model with just150 3 antigenic parameters: a uniform \u03b3vac for vaccination and boosting (downweighted by a factor151 a in the \u03b4\u2212 o shift to account for double infections 42) and a uniform \u03b3k = b\u03b3vac for all infection152 channels k (upweighted by a factor b to correct for relative underreporting; Methods). We infer153 maximum-likelihood (ML) values of these parameters by calibrating computed and empirical154 trajectories, \u2206s(t) and \u2206s\u0302(t), for the \u03b1\u2212 \u03b4 and \u03b4 \u2212 o shifts. The intrinsic selection coefficients,155 s0, are then obtained as the time-independent part of selection. Details of the inference proce-156 dure are given in Methods; ML model parameters and selection coefficients for all clade shifts157 are reported in Table S2 and S3.158\nIn Fig. 3a, we plot \u2206s from the ML fitness model against the corresponding empirical159 selection change, \u2206s\u0302, obtained from the trajectories of Fig. 1b. We obtain a remarkable data160 compression: for most regions, the antigenic fitness computed from equation (3) reproduces161 the empirical fitness changes (intrinsic selection drops out of this comparison). This can be162 further quantified: the covariance between data and ML model, \u3008\u2206s\u2206s\u0302\u3009, explains \u223c 50% of163 the empirical variance of selection, \u3008(\u2206s\u0302)2\u3009; this level of covariance is found on average and164 in most individual regions. A detailed comparison of data and model trajectories, \u2206s\u0302(t) and165 \u2206s(t), for all regions is shown in Figs. S1 and S2. As a control, the model predicts only small166 selection change for the 1\u2212 \u03b1 shift, consistent with the weak time dependence of the empirical167 selection trajectories (Fig. S3). We conclude that time-dependent cross-immunity explains the168 time-dependence of selection governing SARS-CoV-2 variant shifts.169\nImpact of vaccination and infection on evolution From the ML fitness model, we obtain a170 breakdown of intrinsic and antigenic selection components relevant for each clade shift. Intrinsic171 selection is strong and positive in all three major clade shifts, with average selection coefficients172 s0 = 0.05\u2212 0.08, consistent with strong functional differences observed between the \u03b1, \u03b4, and o173 variants 3,43 (Fig. 3b, Table S3). Antigenic selection becomes equally strong in the \u03b1\u2212\u03b4 and \u03b4\u2212o174 shifts. Its two main components, vaccination- and infection-induced selection, are statistically175 significant parts of the fitness model, partial models with only one component have a strongly176\nreduced posterior likelihood (differences in model complexity are accounted for by a Bayesian177 information criterion; see Methods and Table S2).178\nVaccination induces cross-immunity differences between variants, resulting in positive anti-179 genic selection of average strength svac = 0.04 in the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4 shift and svac = 0.06 in the180 \u03b4 \u2212 o shift (Fig. 3b, Table S3). These selection coefficients quantify the evolutionary impact181 of primary SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: they measure the relative increase in effective repro-182 duction number of the invading variant by partial escape from vaccination-induced immunity183 (\u03c40svac = Rinv/Ranc \u2212 1). Vaccination-induced antigenicity also explains the observed time-184 dependence of selection (Fig. 1b, Figs. S1 and S2): svac increases during the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4 shift be-185 cause of increasing vaccination levels, but decreases during the \u03b4 \u2212 o shift because vaccination-186 induced immunity fades. In both shifts, primary vaccination generates the dominant compo-187 nents of antigenic selection (Fig. 3b). Booster vaccinations have increased breadth; they induce188 higher neutralisation T bst\u03b4 , T bst o and reduced antigenic advance \u2206T bst \u03b1\u03b4 ,\u2206T bst \u03b4o compared to pri-189 mary vaccinations 9,10,44,45 (Fig. 2a, Table S1). Hence, booster vaccinations generate higher190 cross-immunity but weaker selection for antigenic escape (Fig. 1c, Fig. 4ab). The net effect191 of boosters in the \u03b4 \u2212 o shift is opposite to that of primary vaccinations: we infer a negative192 selection coefficient sbst = \u22120.01. This is because boosters remove cross-immunity differences193 and antigenic selection generated by the preceding primary vaccination (Fig. 3b).194\nInfection-induced antigenic selection increased in net strength from 0.01 in the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4 shift195 to 0.03 in the \u03b4 \u2212 o shift. Notably, it always contains components of opposite sign: primary196 infections by the ancestral clade generate positive selection, while infections by the invading clade197 generate negative selection. This frequency-dependent negative feedback acts to prolong the198 coexistence of ancestral and invading clade. Together, antigenic selection can produce complex199 but computable patterns of time dependence.200\nThese results require careful interpretation. They show that vaccination and previous infec-201 tions induced sizeable antigenic selection on circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and modulated202 the speed of successive clade shifts. However, antigenic selection did not cause or prevent any203 of these shifts, because intrinsic functional changes generated sizeable fitness advantages of the204 invading variants independently of population immunity. The breakdown of selection given in205 Fig. 3b applies to the set of regions accessible to our analysis; the relative weights of vaccination-206 and infection-induced selection components are expected to be different in other regions. The207 availability of comparable data precludes a fully global model-based analysis. An additional,208 model-free inference of selection in regions with low vaccination coverage is given in Methods.209 Most importantly, the fitness model and our data analysis do not predict any simple relation210 between vaccination coverage and speed of evolution. This is because cross-immunity channels211 are correlated: fewer vaccinations lead to more infections, generating buildup of cross-immunity212 in other channels and complex long-term effects.213\nFitness trajectories and selection hotspots The ML fitness model can be applied to the214 long-term turnover of viral clades up to date, including recent frequency changes between the215 variants BA.1, BA.2, and BA.4/5 within the o clade (we use shorthands o1, o2, and o45). First,216 we look at two building blocks of antigenic fitness: antigenic landscapes and immune weights.217 We define antigenic landscapes for each immune channel k by plotting all cross-immunity factors218 cki against their corresponding titers T k i (using a fixed time delay \u2206t = \u03c4 to account for antibody219 decay in an approximate way; Methods). These landscapes visualise antigenic drift, that is, the220 partial escape from population immunity by gradual evolutionary steps 46,47 (Fig. 4a-c; arrows221 mark sizeable steps between successive variants). In this picture, the time-dependence of cross-222 immunity is captured by immune weight functions Qk(t), which measure recent infections or223 vaccinations in channel k, again over a time window of order \u03c4 (Fig. 4d, Methods). Next, we224 juxtapose these immune trajectories to long-term trajectories showing the antigenic selection225 between successive variants, sag(t) (Fig. 4e), and the fitness gap of each variant, \u03b4fi(t) = fi(t)\u2212226\nf\u0304(t) (Fig. 4f); these trajectories are computed from equation (3). Fitness gaps are shifted by the227 mean population fitness f\u0304(t) = \u2211 i xi(t)fi(t) and include the intrinsic component (Methods).228 As expected from the analysis above, the ML model is in quantitative agreement with empirical229 selection (dots in Fig. 4f). The trajectories of Fig. 4ef are averaged over 14 regions (for regional230\ntrajectories, see Fig. S4).231\nTogether, the trajectories of Fig. 4 show a pattern of selection hotspots. The fitness model232 predicts time windows of strong antigenic selection when antigenic advance on the flank of a Hill233 landscape generates sizeable cross-immunity loss and coincides with high immune weight. We234 now trace this pattern through successive clade shifts. At early stages of evolution, until spring235 2021, all immune weights were small (Fig. 4d). Hence, intrinsic selection governed the 1 \u2212 \u03b1236 shift; consistently, the antigenic advance (neutralisation titer drop) \u2206T vac1\u03b1 was small (Fig. 4a).237 Between spring 2021 and spring 2022, primary and booster vaccination generated the dominant238 immune weights and induced directional antigenic selection for escape from the vaccine strain,239 while infection-induced immunity remained relatively small (Fig. 4d). The clade shifts \u03b1\u2212\u03b4 and240 \u03b4\u2212o carried increasing antigenic advance \u2206T vac\u03b1\u03b4 and \u2206T vac\u03b4o , and smaller advance with respect to241 boosting (Fig. 4ab). These changes mark the onset of antigenic drift. The fitness model identifies242 a first clear hotspot of antigenic selection driving the \u03b4\u2212 o shift. At the start of this shift, large243 cross-immunity change and large immune weight coincided in the primary vaccination channel244 (orange arrows in Fig. 4ade). This is consistent with the observed dynamics: \u03b4 \u2212 o was faster245 than the previous shifts and under exceptionally high initial selection, s\u0302 = 0.15 (orange arrow in246 Fig. 4f, Fig. 1b). The following shift, o1\u2212 o2, involved subclades with similar neutralisation by247 primary and booster vaccination. This shift is inferred to be governed predominantly by intrinsic248 selection (Table S1 and S3); consistently, selection is only weakly time-dependent (Fig. S3).249\nThe most recent viral-immune co-evolution shows two important novelties. In spring 2022,250 infection immunity increased, while vaccination-induced immunity decreased; both components251 are reaching comparable weights (Fig. 4d). Whether vaccination remains at sizeable immune252 weight will depend on availability and acceptance of vaccines in the future. These immune weight253 changes also mark the onset of immune drift, that is, the response of population immunity to254 antigenic drift of the viral population. Recently, population immunity has shifted its center of255 mass from wt towards o; components cognate to each of these clades have reached comparable256 weight (red arrows in Fig. 4d).257\nAt this point, our fitness model predicts the next selection hotspot for novel variants car-258 rying antigenic advance away from vaccination and from o infections. The recent antigenic259 evolution within the o clade follows this scenario: the emerging variants o4 and o5 (BA.4 and260 BA.5) combine antigenic advance in three channels 45,48 (red arrows in Fig. 4bce). Consistently,261 these variants show fast initial growth with empirical selection s\u0302 = 0.12 (red arrow in Fig. 4f).262 Moreover, near-future mutations carrying antigenic advance in the same channels are predicted263 to be in the same hotspot (dashed arrows in Fig. 4bc).264\nIf these emerging variants develop into major clade shifts, they will further increase the o265 immune weight factors. On the other hand, population immunity against earlier variants could266 be maintained by backboosting 49 of o infections or by bivalent vaccines with a wt component.267 The future evolutionary trajectories of new variants will also depend on their mutual antigenic268 relations, which have not yet been assayed comprehensively to date. Together, the recent evolu-269 tionary dynamics signals the unfolding of antigenic complexity towards coexistence of multiple270 antigenic variants and immune classes.271\nDiscussion272\nHere we have established a data-driven, multi-component fitness model for the evolution of273 SARS-CoV-2. By applying this model to recent evolutionary trajectories in multiple regions,274 we have quantified intrinsic and antigenic selection driving the genetic and functional evolution275 of the virus. In particular, primary vaccination impacted on the speed of global clade shifts in276 2021. Booster vaccination generated higher cross-protection, but weaker selection for antigenic277 escape in the same period (Fig. 3). These results underscore that vaccine breadth is important278 for constraining antigenic escape evolution. More broadly, they highlight the need to integrate279\nevolutionary feedback into vaccine design.280\nIn the recent evolution of SARS-CoV-2, two general trends are revealed by our analysis.281 Antigenic selection has increased in strength and has broadened its target: primary infection282 by distinct viral variants has generated an increasing number of antigenic selection components283 (Fig. 3b, Fig. 4). These trends mark the transition from initial, post-zoonotic adaptation of284 the virus to evolution to an endemic state, where antigenic evolution continues to be fuelled by285 the buildup of population immunity to circulating viral variants. A plausible end point of this286 transition becomes clear by comparison with influenza, a long-term endemic virus in humans.287 In influenza, the viral escape from population immunity follows a specific mode of antigenic288 drift, where multiple variants with different cross-immunity profiles compete for prevalence 50.289 This mode is marked by continuous, adaptive clade turnover with characteristic time scales290 of several months, which is substantially slower than the recent prevalence shifts of SARS-291 CoV-2 variants (Fig. 1a). In contrast, non-antigenic mutations in influenza proteins are under292 broad negative selection; observed changes often compensate the deleterious collateral effects293 of antigenic evolution on conserved molecular traits (including protein stability and receptor294 binding) 50\u201352. If SARS-CoV-2 reaches a similar endemic state, antigenic evolution is expected295 to slow down and most intrinsic changes, e.g., in binding affinity to human receptors, will296 become compensatory. Recent findings of compensatory evolution leading to Omicron support297 this scanario 53.298\nThe expected transition of SARS-CoV-2 to gradual, multi-faceted antigenic evolution will299 open the possibility to predict the future evolution of the viral population by data-driven fitness300 models 24,37,38 and to inform preemptive vaccination strategies 54. Previous work has estab-301 lished an important prerequisite of predictions: neutralisation assays of human antisera against302 viral strains quantify the immune protection of human cohorts against secondary infections 13,14.303 Here, we have shown that this data can be harvested at the population scale, to compute im-304 mune drift and inform antigenic fitness models. As a first step of short-term predictions, we have305 identified emerging variants in antigenic selection hotspots, in quantitative agreement with their306 observed clade growth (Fig. 4). This and future predictions of SARS-CoV-2 evolution require307 integrated analysis of genome sequences, epidemiological records, and increasingly complex anti-308 genic data. While sequence and epidemiological data are already collected in large amounts, our309 analysis calls for world-wide, real-time tracking of antigenic evolution by cross-neutralisation310 assays. This will be critical for our ability to predict antigenic escape evolution and to integrate311 such predictions into vaccine design.312\nMethods313\nSequence data and primary sequence analysis. The study is based on sequence data from the GI-314 SAID EpiCov database 5 available until 06-22-2022. For quality control, we truncate the 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 regions315 of sequences and remove sequences that contain more than 5% ambigous sites or have an incomplete316 collection date. We align all sequences against a reference isolate from GenBank 55 (MN908947), using317 MAFFT v7.490 56. Then we map sequences to Variants of Concern/Interest (VOCs/VOIs), using the set318 of identifier amino acid changes given in Outbreak.info 27. As a cross-check, we independently infer a319 maximum-likelihood (ML) strain tree from quality-controlled sequences under the nucleotide substitution320 model GTR+G of IQTree 57, using the reference isolate hCoV-19/Wuhan/Hu-1/2019 (GISAID-Accession:321 EPI ISL 402125) as root. For assessment of the tree topology, we use the ultrafast bootstrap function 58322 with 1000 replicates. Internal nodes are timed by TreeTime 59 with a fixed clock rate of 8\u00d7 10\u22124 under323 a skyline coalescent tree prior 60. Consistently, variants are mapped to unique genetic clades (subtrees)324 of the ML tree (Fig. 2b).325\nFrequency trajectories of variants. For a given variant i, we define the smoothened count ni(t) =326 Z\u22121 \u2211 \u03bd\u2208i exp[\u2212(t \u2212 t\u03bd)4/\u03b44], where the sum runs over all sequences \u03bd mapped to variant i, t\u03bd is the327 collection date of sequence \u03bd, and Z is a normalisation constant. We use a smoothening period \u03b4 =328 33d. The corresponding variant frequency is then defined by normalisation over all co-existing variants,329 xi(t) = ni(t)/ \u2211 i ni(t). These frequency trajectories, evaluated separately for each region of this study,330 are shown in Fig. 1 and Figs. S1, S2.331\nInference of empirical selection. In a population of different variants, the absolute fitness of each332 variant is defined as the growth rate of its population,333\nfi(t) = N\u0307i(t)\nNi(t) (4)\n(i = 1, . . . , n). The absolute fitness is related to its reproductive number, defined as the mean number of334 new infections generated by an individual during its infectious period \u03c40,335\nRi(t) = exp[\u03c40fi(t)]. (5)\nThe fitness difference (selection coefficient) between a given pair of variants, sij(t) = fi(t) \u2212 fj(t), is336 given by sij(t) = (d/dt)(logNi(t) \u2212 logNj(t)) = (d/dt) log((Ni(t)/Nj(t)), independently of the other337 co-circulating variants. This relation can also be written in terms of the population frequencies xi(t) =338 Ni(t)/ \u2211 kNk(t), leading to equation (1) of the main text.339 For each clade shift and each region included in the study, we infer a trajectory of empirical selection,340 341\ns\u0302 = (s\u0302(t1), s\u0302(t2), . . . , s\u0302(tn)), (6)\nwhich records the time-dependent fitness difference between invading and ancestral strain, s\u0302(ti) =342 finv(ti) \u2212 fanc(ti) (i = 1, . . . , n). A hat distinguishes these empirical selection coefficients from their343 model-based counterparts introduced below. At each point of the trajectory, we evaluate the selection344 gradient of equation (1),345\ns\u0302(ti) = 1\n\u2206t\n[ log ( xinv(ti + \u2206t/2)\nxanc(ti + \u2206t/2)\n) \u2212 log ( xinv(ti \u2212\u2206t/2) xanc(ti \u2212\u2206t/2) )] (i = 1, . . . , n), (7)\nusing a time window \u2206t = 30d for the 1 \u2212 \u03b1 and \u03b4 \u2212 o shifts and \u2206t = 40d for the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4 shift (which346 extends over a longer period). Increasing \u2206t reduces the statistical error of s\u0302(ti) but reduces the time347 span covered by a trajectory s\u0302. We evaluate equation (6) for the maximal time interval such that348 xanc(ti \u00b1\u2206t/2) > 0.01 and xinv(ti \u00b1\u2206t/2) > 0.01 along the entire trajectory. The start point349 t1 is the first day when xinv(t \u2212 \u2206t/2) > 0.01. From this point, selection is recorded weekly,350 ti\u2212ti\u22121 = 7d (i = 2, . . . , n), and tn is the last point of this sequence where xanc(t+\u2206t/2) > 0.01.351 Single measurements s\u0302(ti) are excluded when at least one of the sequence counts nanc(ti\u00b1\u2206t/2)352 or ninv(ti \u00b1\u2206t/2) is < 10. Statistical errors for selection trajectories are evaluated by binomial353 sampling of counts nanc(t) and ninv(t) with a pseudocount of 1. Empirical selection trajectories354 are reported in Fig. 1b and Figs. S1-S3.355\nFor the subsequent analysis, we grade the complete clade shifts 1 \u2212 \u03b1, \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4, \u03b4 \u2212 o1, o1 \u2212356 o2 by the time dependence of their empirical selection trajectories (Fig. S3). We evaluate357 two summary statistics: (i) the amount of systematic time-dependent variation of selection,358 defined as Var(slin), averaged over regions, where slin(t) is a linear regression to the ensemble359 of trajectories; (ii) the statistical significance of the linear regression, P (two-sided Wald test).360 This identifies two shifts with substantial, statistically significant time-dependent variation of361 selection, \u03b1\u2212 \u03b4 and \u03b4 \u2212 o.362\nInfection and vaccination trajectories. Daily vaccination and infection rates for individual363 regions have been obtained from Ourworldindata.org 6 and from CDC COVID Data Tracker 7364 for US states (download date: 06-22-2022). Clade-specific infection rates yk(t) are computed by365 multiplying the total daily infection rates reported in each region with the simultaneous viral366 clade frequencies xk(t). The resulting cumulative population fractions of infected individuals,367 yk(t), together with cumulative population fractions of primary and booster vaccinations, yvac(t)368 and ybst(t), are reported in Figs. S1-S2.369\nData integration for regional analysis. This study is based on sequence data and epidemi-370 ological data from multiple regions (countries and US states) for parallel analysis. Sequence371 data is used to infer empirical selection trajectories for individual clade shifts, as defined in372 equations (6) and (7). Epidemiological records provide input to the antigenic fitness model,373 equations (2) and (3). Evaluation of the fitness model, which is detailed below, integrates data374 of both categories and requires stringent criteria of data availability and comparability.375\nTo enable this analysis, we choose the set of countries to be included in model inference376 based on uniform criteria. Additionally, we include 3 US states (New York, Texas, California),377 each representative of a different geographic region, that satisfy the same criteria. For each378 clade shift anc \u2212 inv, we require the following: (i) anc and inv are majority variants at times379 t and t\u2032 > t of the clade shift, respectively; i.e., xanc(t) > 0.5 and xinv(t) > 0.5. This criterion380 excludes regions where other variants are prevalent during the shift anc \u2212 inv (e.g., Brazil and381 South Africa have x\u03b1 < 0.5 throughout the 1 \u2212 \u03b1 shift). (ii) anc and inv have a combined,382 smoothened sequence count nanc(t) + ninv(t) > n0 throughout the clade shift. This criterion383 ensures that the empirical frequencies xanc(t) and xinv(t), especially minority frequencies, can384 be estimated with reasonable statistical errors. We use threshold values n0 = 500 for 1\u2212 \u03b1 and385 \u03b1\u2212 \u03b4 and n0 = 750 for \u03b4 \u2212 o (reflecting the increased sequence availability). (iii) The empirical386 selection trajectory s\u0302 contains at least 4 (1 \u2212 \u03b1, \u03b4 \u2212 o) or 6 (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4) measured points s\u0302(ti); the387 threshold values reflect the relative duration of shifts. This criterion ensures a sufficient signal-388 to-noise ratio for inference of temporal variation along the trajectory. (iv) In the \u03b4\u2212 o shift, the389 cumulative fraction of o infections exceeds a threshold value, yo > 0.01. The o variant, which is390 characterised by many less severe cases, is likely to be particularly affected by underreporting.391 This criterion excludes regions with very low o count (yo is less than \u223c 20% of the remaining392 regions) and ensures that cross-immunity trajectories, as given by equation (2), can be evaluated393 across regions with sufficient consistency. (v) Vaccinations have been predominantly by mRNA394 vaccines and epidemiological records in the database 6 are complete. This criterion ensures that395 antigenic data for mRNA vaccines can be used uniformly (Table S1). It excludes regions with396 substantial use of viral vector vaccines (e.g., the UK) and with partial records (e.g., for booster397 vaccinations in Sweden and Croatia).398\nBased on these criteria, our analysis includes (i) 11 regions for the 1\u2212\u03b1 shift, (ii) 16 regions399 for the \u03b1\u2212 \u03b4 shift, and (iii) 14 regions for the \u03b4 \u2212 o shift (Fig. 1, Fig. 3, Figs. S1-S3). Regions400 analysed for both \u03b1\u2212 \u03b4 and \u03b4\u2212 o are used for the long-term trajectories (Fig. 4, Fig. S4). Scope401 and limitations of this set of regions for the inference of selection are described below.402\nAntigenic data. Neutralisation assays for SARS-CoV-2 test the potency of antisera induced403 by a given primary immunisation to neutralise viruses of different variants. Log dilution titers404\nmeasure the minimum antiserum concentration required for neutralisation,405\nT ki = log2 K0\nKki , (8)\nrelative to a reference concentration K0. Hence, log2 titer differences, or neutralisation fold406 changes, \u2206T kij \u2261 \u2206T ki \u2212 T kj , measure differences in antigenicity between variants, \u2206T kij =407 log2(K k j /K k i ). We note that these differences are specific to each primary challenge (immune408\nchannel) k. For example, the inequality T bst\u03b1\u03b4 < T vac \u03b1\u03b4 reflects the increased breadth of booster409 vaccinations compared to primary vaccinations. In contrast, uni-valued antigenic distances be-410 tween variants, dij , can be computed from the titer matrix (T k i ) by multi-dimensional scaling411 methods 61,62. Such distance measures average over inhomogeneities between immune channels.412 Here we define a matrix of titer drops \u2206T ki ,413\n\u2206T ki = T k \u2217 \u2212 T ki (i = \u03b1, \u03b4, o (o1), o2, o45; k = \u03b1, \u03b4, o (o1), o2, o45, vac, bst), (9)\nwith respect to a reference for each immune channel, T k\u2217 = T k k (k = \u03b1, \u03b4, o(o1), o2, o45) and414\nT k\u2217 = T k 1 (k = vac, bst). This procedure eliminates technical differences between assays in415 absolute antibody concentration. We assemble this matrix in Table S1, using primary data416 from different sources 3,8, 9, 28, 29,44,45,48,63\u201378. We proceed as follows: (i) For matrix elements417 with available data, \u2206T ki is the average of the corresponding primary measurements. This418 procedure eliminates technical differences between assays in absolute antibody concentration.419 As appropriate for the analysis in our set of regions, all vaccination titers refer to mRNA vaccines.420 (ii) If no data are available for \u2206T ki but the conjugate titer \u2206T i k has been measured, we use the421 approximate substitution \u2206T ki \u2248 \u2206T ik, as discussed in ref. [79]. (iii) If no data are available for422 \u2206T ki but the titer \u2206T k j of a closely related clade has been measured, we use the approximate423 substitution \u2206T ki \u2248 \u2206T kj , which should be understood as a lower bound (this applies to the424 recent variants o2 and o45).425 The matrix of absolute neutralisation titers, T ki , is then computed by equation (9), combining426 the titer drops \u2206T ki of Table S1 and the reference titers T k \u2217 = 6.5, (k = \u03b1, \u03b4, o(o1), o2, o45),427\nT vac\u2217 = 7.8, T bst \u2217 = 9.8 reported in ref. [30]. A titer difference between vaccination and booster,428 T bst\u2217 \u2212 T vac\u2217 \u2248 2.0, has been observed in several studies 9,10,44. The titers T ki enter the cross-429 immunity functions cki , C k i (t), and c\u0304 k i defined below and are shown in Fig. 2ab.430 The decay of antibody concentration after primary immunisation has been characterised in431 recent work 31,32. Here we describe this effect by a linear titer reduction with time after primary432 challenge,433\nT ki (\u2206t) = T k i \u2212\n\u2206t\n\u03c4 , (10)\ncorresponding to an exponential decay of antibody concentration, with a uniform decay time434 90d (i.e., half life \u03c4 = 65d). This is broadly consistent with experimental data; we infer decay435 times in the range [60, 170]d from several studies 8,9, 31,32,44. In addition, we check that varying436 \u03c4 in this range does not affect our results (in particular, the rank order of variants with respect437 to antigenic fitness remains unchanged).438\nCross-immunity trajectories. The cross-immunity factor cki is defined as the relative reduction439 in infections by variant i induced by (recent) immunisation in channel k. As shown in recent440 work 13,14, absolute titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assays can predict cross-immunity, cki =441 H(T ki ) with442\nH(T ) = 1\n1 + exp[\u2212\u03bb(T \u2212 T50)] . (11)\nThis relation has been established in ref. [13] with constants T50 = 4.2 and \u03bb = 0.9. The resulting443 cross-immunity factors cki (\u2206t) include antibody decay, as given by equation (10). Hence, they444\ndepend on the time since primary immunisation,445 cki (\u2206t) = H ( T ki \u2212 \u2206t\u03c4 ) . (12)\nThese factors enter the population cross-immunity functions Cki (t), equation (2), which become446 447\nCki (t) = \u222b t H ( T ki \u2212 t\u2212t \u2032\n\u03c4\n) y\u0307(t) dt\u2032. (13)\nThese functions enter all evaluations of the fitness model, equation (3) (Fig. 1c, Fig. 3, Fig. 4ef,448 Figs. S1, S2, and S4).449\nTo display the emergence of selection hotspots, we approximate the cross-immunity functions,450 equation (13), by time-independent effective factors and immune weights. (i) The effective451 cross-immunity factors c\u0304ki are obtained from equation (12) at a fixed time delay \u2206t = \u03c4 after452 primary immunisation, c\u0304ki = H(T k i \u2212 1), which accounts for the decay of immune response in453 an approximate way. These factors define the antigenic landscapes shown in Fig. 4a-c. (ii) The454 immune weight functions,455\nQk(t) = \u222b t \u2212\u221e H ( T0 \u2212 t\u2212t \u2032 \u03c4 ) y\u0307(t\u2032) dt\u2032, (14)\nmeasure the effective population fractions of immune individuals in channel k. They account456 for immune decay from a fixed reference titer T0 = 6.5 and follow the time-dependence of457 cross-immunity functions Cki (t) and selection coefficients sk(t) in an approximate way (Fig. 4de,458 Fig. S4). Selection hotspots emerge if large steps on an antigenic landscape, c\u0304kinv\u2212 c\u0304kanc, coincide459 with sizeable immune weights Qk(t) in one or more immune channels (Fig. 4).460\nFitness model. Equation (3) expresses the fitness of viral variants as a sum of intrinsic and461 antigenic fitness components, fi(t) = f 0 i + \u2211 k f k i (t). Intrinsic fitness, f0, integrates contributions462 from several molecular phenotypes, including protein stability, host receptor binding, and traits463 related to intra-cellular viral replication. The antigenic components fki (t) describe the impact of464 antibody binding on viral growth, summed over the immune repertoire components of different465 channels of primary infection or vaccination. Importantly, the input of this fitness model can466 be learned by integration of sequence data, epidemiological records, and antigenic assays.467\nThe additive form the fitness model neglects epistasis between fitness components. The468 additivity assumption is justified between intrinsic and antigenic fitness, because these compo-469 nents are associated to different stages of the viral replication cycle. The additivity of antigenic470 fitness components rests on the approximation of a well-mixed host population and short infec-471 tion times. In this approximation, each viral lineage is subject to a dense sequence of random472 encounters with hosts of different immune channels k, leading to averaging of antigenic fitness473 effects. Multiple infections in an individual can generate additional immune channels; however,474 these effects are relatively small over the short periods of SARS-CoV-2 evolution studied in this475 paper.476\nOur analysis of the fitness model focuses on selection coefficients between co-existing variants,477 478 sij(t) \u2261 fi(t)\u2212 fj(t) = s0ij \u2212 \u2211 k \u03b3k [ Cki (t)\u2212 Ckj (t) ] , (15)\nbecause these can directly be compared with their empirical counterparts s\u0302ij(t). Of equal impor-479 tance, selection coefficients within a region decouple from the changes in viral ecology within that480 region. Specifically, seasonality and contact limitations can generate strongly time-dependent481 reproductive numbers. However, any modulation of the form R(t) \u2192 \u03b1(t)R(t) leaves the se-482 lection coefficients sij invariant, as can be seen from equation (5). Our inference of empirical483 selection, as described above, is also independent of the underlying infectious period \u03c40, which484 may itself be under evolutionary pressure and change with time 80,81. To keep this independence,485 we report all selection coefficients in fixed units [1/d].486\nInference of fitness model parameters. The free parameters \u03b3k (k = 1, . . . , n) measure the487 fitness effect of each cross-immunity component. These parameters calibrate the model to data488 of complex real populations differing, for example, in population structure (including incidence489 structure), infection histories, and monitoring of infections. To avoid overfitting, we use a490 minimal model with just 3 global antigenic parameters: (i) A basic rate \u03b3vac = \u03b3bst translates491 cross-immunity generated by vaccination into units of selection. (ii) This rate is downweighted492 to a value \u03b3\u2032vac = a\u03b3vac for the shift \u03b4 \u2212 o and later shifts. This can be seen as a heuristic to493 account for the effect of double infections 42, which increase cross-immunity and decrease cross-494 immunity differences between variants. (iii) Cross-immunity in all infection channels is uniformly495 upweighted, \u03b3k = b\u03b3vac, to account for underreporting of infections relative to vaccinations.496\nOur inference proceeds in two steps. First, we train the antigenic fitness model using data497 from the clade shifts \u03b1\u2212\u03b4 and \u03b4\u2212o. These shifts are suitable because they carry sizeable antigenic498 advance \u2206T vac\u03b1\u03b4 and \u2206T vac \u03b4o (Fig. 2a), selection shows a substantial and statistically significant499 time dependence (Fig. 1b), and population immunity has started to pick up (Fig. 4d). We infer500 the ML likelihood model by aggregation of log likelihood scores over the sets of regional selection501 trajectories for the clade shifts \u03b1\u2212 \u03b4 and \u03b4 \u2212 o. We use the score function502\nL(s\u0302, s) = \u2212 n\u2211 i=1 (\u2206s\u0302(ti)\u2212\u2206s(ti))2 2\u03c32(ti) (16)\nfor a single empirical selection trajectory s\u0302, equation (6), and its model-based counterpart s. This503 score evaluates selection change, \u2206s(t) = s(t)\u2212 \u3008s\u3009, where brackets denote averaging over time.504 Hence, the fitness model is trained on the time-dependence of selection in each region, in order to505 avoid the confounding factor of heterogeneity across regions. The expected square deviation is506 \u03c32(ti) = \u03c3 2 s(ti) +\u03c3 2 0; the first term describes the sampling error of sequence counts, which enters507 frequency and empirical selection estimates, the second term summarises fluctuations unrelated508 to sequence counts. The total log likelihood score is the sum L = \u2211 L(s, s\u0302), which runs over509\nboth shifts and all included regions. Table S2 lists the ML parameters \u03b3vac, a, b and the ML510 score L relative to a null model of time-independent selection (see below). The 95% confidence511 intervals of the inferred parameters are computed by resampling the empirical selection data with512 fluctuations \u03c32. We note that the ML values a < 1, b > 1 are consistent with the interpretation513 of these parameters as weighting factors accounting for double-infections and underreporting514 (see above). Second, we infer the intrinsic selection for each shift as the difference between515 empirical selection and ML antigenic selection, s0 = \u3008\u3008s\u0302 \u2212 sag\u3009\u3009, where the double brackets516 denote averaging over time and regions. The ML antigenic selection coefficients, \u3008\u3008sk\u3009\u3009, and the517 intrinsic selection coefficient s0 between invading and ancestral variant are listed in Table S3;518 see also Fig. 3b. Confidence intervals are computed by resampling model parameters with their519 confidence intervals. Consistently, we infer weak antigenic selection for the shifts 1 \u2212 \u03b1 and520 o1\u2212 o2, which also show only weak time dependence of selection (Fig. S3).521\nSignificance analysis of the fitness model. To assess the statistical significance of our inference,522 we compare four fitness models of the form (3): the full model used in the main text (VI:523 antigenic selection by vaccination and infection, intrinsic selection), two partial models (V:524 antigenic selection only by vaccination, intrinsic selection; I: antigenic selection only by infection,525 intrinsic selection), and a null model (0: intrinsic selection only). We infer conditional ML526 parameters for each model and we rank models by their ML score difference to the null model,527 \u2206L = L \u2212 L0 (Table S2). An alternative ranking by BIC score 82, which contains a score528 penalty for the number of model parameter, leads to the same result. We observe the following:529 (i) All antigenic fitness models have significantly higher scores than the null model, which shows530 that the empirical selection data are incompatible with time-independent selection. (ii) The531 full model has a significantly higher score than any of the other models; both vaccination and532 infection are significant components of antigenic selection. (iii) Vaccination explains a larger part533\nof the time-dependent data than infection (\u2206LV > \u2206LI), which is consistent with the ranking of534 selection coefficients inferred from the full model (Fig. 3b, Table S3). (iv) The score gain of the535 full model is less than the sum of its parts (\u2206LIV < \u2206LV + \u2206LI). This can be associated with536 statistical correlations in the input data for both antigenic model components. For example, the537 fraction of vaccinated individuals yvac is weakly anti-correlated with the fraction of \u03b4 infections,538 y\u03b4.539\nFitness trajectories. Long-term fitness trajectories display clade turnover of multiple succes-540 sive shifts (Fig. 4f, Fig. S4). For each of the variants \u03b1, \u03b4, o(o1), o2, o45, we plot the time-541 dependent fitness gap, \u03b4fi(t) = fi(t)\u2212 f\u0304(t), where f\u0304(t) = \u2211 j xj(t)fj(t) is the mean population542 fitness. Like selection coefficients, fitness gaps decouple from ecological factors affecting absolute543 growth (see the discussion above). Assuming that the fitness difference between ancestral and544 invading variant, s(t), is dominant during each crossover, we obtain the fitness gap trajectories545 \u03b4fanc(t) = \u2212s(t)xinv(t) and \u03b4finv(t) = \u2212s(t)[1\u2212 xinv(t)], as well as their empirical counterparts546 \u03b4f\u0302anc(t) and \u03b4f\u0302inv(t). For each variant, we patch trajectories from origination to near-fixation547 (here in the time interval (t0,i, tf,i) given by xi(t0,i) = 0.01 and xi(tf,i) = 0.99). The long-term548 trajectories display selection hotspots and confirm the quantitative agreement between empirical549 and model-based fitness.550\nModel-based inference of selection across regions. As shown by the preceding analysis, we551 can infer a statistically significant fitness model with few, global parameters from sequence552 and epidemiological data aggregated over a set of regions and combined with antigenic data.553 The model describes common time-dependent patterns of selection in these regions and serves554 two main purposes: to provide a breakdown of selection in intrinsic and antigenic components555 (Fig. 3) and to display selection hotspots in long-term trajectories (Fig. 4). Our inference556 procedure rests on stringent criteria for the joint availability of sequence and epidemiological557 data in each of these regions (as listed above). A number of points support this procedure:558 (i) The results are robust under variation of the inclusion criteria for regions. In particular, the559 signal of antigenic selection in data and model is broadly distributed over regions (Figs. S1-S3).560 Hence, the selection averages reported in Fig. 3b and Table S3 are reproducible in subsampled561 sets of regions. (ii) Within the set of regions included, the model is applicable beyond the \u03b1\u2212 \u03b4562 and \u03b4 \u2212 o shifts used for training. The early 1 \u2212 \u03b1 shift and the recent o1 \u2212 o2 shifts serve as563 controls. In both cases, we infer weak antigenic selection, consistent with weak time dependence564 of empirical selection (Fig. S4). For the emerging o2 \u2212 o45 shift, strong antigenic selection is565 consistent with fast initial growth of the new variants.566\nOur model-based inference of selection excludes a number of regions that do not fulfil the567 criteria of joint data availability. (i) For the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4 shift, several regions are excluded because568 VOCs other than \u03b1 were majority variants prior to the shift to \u03b4 (for example, Beta in South569 Africa and Gamma in Brazil). Unlike \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4, these shifts do not involve antigenic advance in570 the vaccination channel; i.e., \u2206T vacanc \u03b4 < 0. However, we lack comprehensive antigenic data on571 other VOCs as input for the fitness model. (ii) For the \u03b4 \u2212 o shift, several regions are excluded572 because of low reported incidence (e.g., Brazil, California, India, Mexico, Poland, South Korea,573 Turkey, Texas). Most of these regions show a signal of time-dependent selection consistent with574 the regions included; however, much lower reported incidence counts prevent reliable immune575 tracking of infection channels during the \u03b4 \u2212 o shift. Variation in reported incidence can, in576 principle, be incorporated into the fitness model by region-dependent \u03b3vac factors, but this would577 likely lead to overfitting. We conclude that at current levels of data availability, a comprehensive578 cross-regional analysis is not feasible.579\nModel-free inference of selection in regions with low vaccination coverage. Countries580 with low vaccination coverage during the \u03b1\u2212 \u03b4 shift (yvac < 0.1) disqualify for the model-based581 analysis because \u03b1 was not a majority variant (India, Malaysia, Russia, Philippines, Indonesia,582\nSouth Africa, South Korea) or sequence counts are too low for the inference of selection trajec-583 tories (Australia). For this set of countries, we can still infer a selection coefficient s by fitting a584 sigmoid function to the frequency trajectory x\u03b4(t) (to be interpreted as the growth difference be-585 tween \u03b4 and the average of all other coexisting variants). We find lower region-averaged selection586 in the set of low-vaccination countries compared to other countries (\u3008\u3008s\u0302\u3009\u3009 = 0.08 vs. \u3008\u3008s\u0302\u3009\u3009 = 0.12).587 This is qualitatively consistent with our model-based inference of vaccination-induced selec-588 tion; however, the genetic heterogeneity of this clade shift prevents a systematic breakdown of589 antigenic selection into immune channels.590\nData availability.
