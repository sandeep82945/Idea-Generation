    "abstractText": "Background: Newborn screening (NBS) can prevent inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs), which may cause longterm disability and even death in newborns. However, in China, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) screening has just started. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of NBS using MS/MS in Shenzhen under the nationally recommended program, as well as evaluate the value and affordability of introducing this new screening technology. Methods: A Markov model was built to estimate the cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of different screening programs. We compared PKU screening using traditional immunofluorescence (IF) with the other 11 IEMs not screened and all 12 IEMs screened using MS/MS, and the programs detecting different numbers of IEMs chosen from the national recommended program were also compared. A sensitivity analysis and budget impact analysis (BIA) were performed. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of detecting all 12 IEMs in the national program is 277,823 RMB per QALY, below three times per capita GDP in Shenzhen. MS/MS screening in Shenzhen can be cost-effective only if at least three diseases (PKU, PCD and MMA) are covered and when the screening program covers five diseases (PKU, PCD, MMA, MSUD, IVA), the ICER closely approaches its critical threshold. The BIA indicated the implementation cost of the national program to be around 490 million RMB over 10 years and showed no difference in budget between programs detecting different numbers of IEMs. Conclusions: We conclude that the newborn screening using MS/MS in Shenzhen is cost-effective, and the budget affordable for the Shenzhen government. Two concepts for selecting the IEMs to be detected are also presented. One is to choose the most cost-effective screening programs detecting highest number of IEMs to achieve a minimal ICER. The other considers the curability and affordability of the disease as the basis of healthcare decisions to screen suitable IEMs, achieving an ICER under the threshold and close to the minimum value.",

We compared PKU screening using traditional immunofluorescence (IF) with the other 11 IEMs not screened and all 12 IEMs screened using MS/MS, and the programs detecting different numbers of IEMs chosen from the national recommended program were also compared. A sensitivity analysis and budget impact analysis (BIA) were performed.\nResults: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of detecting all 12 IEMs in the national program is 277,823 RMB per QALY, below three times per capita GDP in Shenzhen. MS/MS screening in Shenzhen can be cost-effective only if at least three diseases (PKU, PCD and MMA) are covered and when the screening program covers five diseases (PKU, PCD, MMA, MSUD, IVA), the ICER closely approaches its critical threshold. The BIA indicated the implementation cost of the national program to be around 490 million RMB over 10 years and showed no difference in budget between programs detecting different numbers of IEMs.\nConclusions: We conclude that the newborn screening using MS/MS in Shenzhen is cost-effective, and the budget affordable for the Shenzhen government. Two concepts for selecting the IEMs to be detected are also presented. One is to choose the most cost-effective screening programs detecting highest number of IEMs to achieve a minimal ICER. The other considers the curability and affordability of the disease as the basis of healthcare decisions to screen suitable IEMs, achieving an ICER under the threshold and close to the minimum value.\nKeywords: Newborn screening, Tandem mass spectrometry, Inborn errors of metabolism, Cost-effectiveness\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

While most published studies have numbered\n*Correspondence: xujuan@hust.edu.cn\n1 School of Medicine and Health Management, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nIEMs in the 500\u2013700 range [3\u20135], a recent article estimates the number to be more than 1015 [6], which suggests a relatively higher cumulative incidence of IEMs, compared to a simple disease. There are many discrepancies in the prevalence of IEMs reported in these studies. Donald Waters et\u00a0 al. [7] estimated the global birth prevalence to be 50.9 per 100,000 live births based on a systematic literature review of birth prevalence and case fatality of IEMs globally. Other research indicates prevalence between 40 per 100,000 and 125 per 100,000 [8, 9]. In China, although epidemiological statistics are absent at the country level, regional data reveals an incidence of IEMs ranging from 35.3 per 100,000 to 136.4 per 100,000 [10\u201312]. Notwithstanding the actual incidence, it is now clear that IEMs affect a multitude of newborns and families all over the world.\nMost IEMs are curable given early detection, but without prompt recognition can give rise to long-term disability and even death [13]. Since IEMs are ingravescent, and overlap in clinical manifestations, early symptoms may not be apparent or are challenging for\u00a0 differential\u00a0 diagnosis, if any [14]. The development of newborn screening (NBS) is now a critical tool in the prevention of primary diseases. IEMs can be detected via NBS in asymptomatic patients. In other words, medical intervention can be made quickly in the early stage to control disease progression [15]. Thus, morbidity and mortality associated with IEMs can be effectively reduced [16], and life-threatening or long-term sequelae prevented [17]."

            "text": "Neonatal screening began in the 1970s when Dr. Robert Guthrie developed the dried blood spot (DBS) analysis to measure metabolites in the diagnosis of phenylalanine (PKU) [18]. From there, NBS gradually evolved from a relatively simple test detecting a single congenital condition to a more comprehensive and complex screening system covering over 50 different diseases [19]. Screening methods advanced with the successive application of Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in NBS. Now, MS/MS is the mainstay of NBS given its\u00a0 high specificity and sensitivity [9, 20]. Different conditions, from the most common disease categories to rarer diseases can be simultaneously detected using filter paper spots or directly, in biological fluids [14, 21]. Following Millington et\u00a0al. [22] first putting MS/MS into practice in 1990 to identify metabolic disorders in NBS, its use\u00a0 became widespread across countries [23, 24]. By 2010, the MS/ MS newborn screening coverage in the US had reached 100% with 20\u201340 diseases being detected among different states [25]. Moreover, screening rates in other countries,\nsuch as Germany, the UK and Japan, also reached 90% [26].\nThe number of IEMs screened varies from country to country. In the US and Canada, NBS covers the largest number, 42 IEMs [27, 28]. By contrast, other countries have set the number within the range of 20\u201330, for example, Australia (21 IEMs), New Zealand (23), and Japan (24) [29\u201331], which is similar to that set in some provinces of China, such as Taiwan (24), Zhejiang (28) and Hefei (29) [32\u201336]. In other provinces of Mainland China, the number of IEMs screened for is very limited, only three in Beijing [37, 38] and four in Shenzhen [38]. Additionally, screening programs in South Korea, Germany, and the UK cover less than 20 IEMs, respectively 18, 16, and 9 [31, 39, 40].\nThe newborn screening program in China was first launched in the 1980s [41]. Since then, significant success has been achieved, with the screening rate increasing from 2% in 1995 to 97.5% in 2017 [42]. The application of the MS/MS method to newborn screening in China began relatively recently, in 2002 [43]. A study revealed that more than 60 laboratories throughout the country had performed MS/MS analysis, and about 40 newborn screening centers had developed the MS/MS screening by 2016 [44]. In China, an increasing number of NBS have adopted using MS/MS rather than the traditional immunofluorescence (IF), which is still the primary\u00a0 means in Shenzhen. Thus, there is an urgent need for the Shenzhen government to implement MS/MS screening throughout the city, especially in the context of \u201cNewborn Screening Management Measures\u201d. In February 2019, the Health Commission of Guangdong province revised\u00a0 its \u201cNewborn Screening Management Measures\u201d, highlighting the potential application of advanced technologies, such as MS/MS, to NBS in the province.\nEconomic evaluation of\u00a0MS/MS newborn screening Developments in economic evaluations of MS/MS newborn screening in different countries have aimed to provide scientific and reasoned evidence to support and improve newborn screening programs, including Canada [45], Germany [16, 46], the US [47\u201350], the UK [51, 52], Thailand [53] and other countries [54, 55]. Most of these analyses focus on cost-effectiveness (cost-utility analysis). A smaller proportion of the articles are cost\u2013 benefit analyses [56\u201358]. The\u00a0vast\u00a0majority\u00a0of\u00a0published articles, excepting a study from Thailand, clearly demonstrate that MS/MS screening in their specific country setting is likely a cost-effective healthcare intervention. However, for lack of essential data about IEMs, the number of diseases incorporated in these analyses is usually less than 10. Further, the studies\u2019 results are not comparable given the varying regions, time frames,\nincremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) thresholds, etc. employed in studies. Nevertheless, what cannot be ignored is that economic evaluations prove MS/MS newborn screening to be economically\u00a0 efficient, and offer policymakers helpful scientific evidence for the benefits of NBS programs.\nIn China, to say nothing of Shenzhen province, any economic evaluation of MS/MS neonatal screening is yet to be carried out, except by one research group [59]. However, the focus of that published article was the whole screening program rather than a specific single disease; prioritizing different IEMs for inclusion in the regional screening program remained undiscussed. Also, as the authors of the study themselves acknowledged, its major limitation was its not applying a Markov model-based analysis to evaluate the costs and health benefits of MS/MS screening in China. The Markov model can simulate the natural progression of the IEMs, providing more rigorous results. Endeavoring to correct this situation, we have conducted this study to determine the cost-effectiveness of MS/MS screening in the social and economic context of Shenzhen based on the diseases nominated by the national program. In doing so, we take into account the government budget and explore how to select the appropriate number of IEMs for detection."

The guideline, based on the criteria for disease screening set by the WHO [61], recommends screening for 12 types of IEMs that are relatively common in China and suitable for screening by MS/MS. The twelve IEMs include Phenylketonuria (PKU), Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), Primary carnitine deficiency (PCD), Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCAD), Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCAD), Isovaleric acidemia (IVA), Glutaric acidemia type I (GAI), Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), Citrullinemia type II (CITII), Citrullinemia type I (CIT-I), Propionic acidemia (PA) and Homocystinuria (HCY).

We then estimated both cost and effectiveness to calculate the ICER of expanded screening, with the cost and effectiveness discounted at an annual rate of 3%.\nFor the moment, PKU, CH (congenital\u00a0 hypothyroidism), CAH (congenital adrenal hyperplasia) and G6PD deficiency (Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency) \u2013 the four diseases included in the current screening program \u2013 are compulsorily detected by IF independently in Shenzhen.\nThe expanded screening program, as nationally recommended, is \u201c12 IEMs detected by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), including PKU, MMA, PCD, MCAD, VLCAD, IVA, GA-I, MSUD, CIT-II, CIT-I, PA, HCY\u201d. Only PKU is covered in both the current program and expanded screening. Should the expanded program be implemented, PKU will be detected by MS/ MS, while CH, CAH and G6PD will still invariably be detected by IF. Using MS/MS to screen the 12 IEMs does not mean that CH, CAH and G6PD would not be screened.\nSince the screening program for CH, CAH and G6PD are unchanged and independent and don\u2019t influence each other, we didn\u2019t take them into consideration. All in all, this study compared PKU screened using traditional immunofluorescence (IF) with the remaining 11 IEMs not screened to all 12 IEMs screened using MS/MS.\nIn order to determine an adequate and reasonable number of IEMs, we compared the results of economic evaluations and budget impact analyses of MS/MS screening programs with different disease combinations. First, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis on the program detecting every disease to obtain an ICER ranking of various diseases. Since PKU is already covered in the current NBS program, we needed to concentrate only on the other 11 IEMs. We could then finally determine 11 screening strategies according to the ranking. The first strategy includes PKU and the disease with the smallest ICER, and the second includes PKU and the top two diseases. By parity of reasoning, the 11th strategy is the nationally recommended program covering all 12 diseases."

We assumed that these program costs remain unchanged between the expanded screening and the status quo. What should be noted is that children must receive continuous medical\ntreatment following a positive detection. Because of the increasing numbers of patients year by year, the cost of treatment is necessarily cumulative. The treatment cost of MS/MS screening is mainly that of the IEMs without sequelae, since early detection can sharply reduce the occurrence\u00a0of sequelae, as indicated in the Markov model. By comparison, the treatment cost of current screening is mainly the treatment cost for the IEMs with sequelae. Due to the high mortality rates of some IEMs, we didn\u2019t calculate the treatment cost of patients with diseases which can cause death within their first two years.\nBIA was carried out under the assumption of 200,000 newborns screened annually for ten years (2019\u20132028).

X-axis represents the screening strategy, y-axis represents the ICER of different screening strategies and the diseases detected in strategies are showed on the right. The first strategy covers PKU and PCD, the second covers PKU, PCD and MMA. By parity of reasoning, the 11th strategy is the nationally recommended program covering all 12 diseases. Different colored columns are used to distinguish different strategies\nThe factors contributing to this situation is that detecting a single disease cannot embody the advantages of MS/ MS \u2012 \u201cone blood sampling for multiple diseases\u201d [74] \u2012 but reflects that MS/MS is more expensive than IF. Second, MS/MS screening can be cost-effective only if at least three diseases (PKU, PCD and MMA) are covered. The selection of IEMs for detection associates to the incidence of diseases. The higher the incidence is, the more QALYs can be saved, and the more diseases detected, and the smaller ICER of the program will be. Moreover, when the screening program covers five diseases (PKU, PCD, MMA, MSUD, IVA), the ICER closely approaches its critical value (since the ICER of the program covering six diseases accounts for more than 95% of the ICER of five diseases). The above points can explain not only why the number of NBS programs varies from region to region but can also reveal two strategic policy ideas for selecting the number of diseases covered. One of these strategies is to screen as many IEMs as possible and get a most costeffective screening program with a minimal ICER, like the 11th screening program mentioned above. \u201cOne blood sampling for multiple diseases\u201d allows an MS/MS screening program to cover more IEMs without additional cost.\nTherefore, screening more diseases leads to more QALYs saved, making the screening program more economically efficient. The first policy idea finally can attain a minimal ICER as the decision-maker adds more and more IEMs into the NBS program, which is perhaps the reason for the US and Canada setting their number of IEMs at 42. Significantly, this strategy proposes the request to regions in terms of social, economic and medical science development. The other policy strategy is to get an almost best screening program detecting suitable IEMs, with an ICER under the cost-effectiveness threshold and close to its minimum value, like 5th screening program mentioned above. In fact, there exists the inevitable problem of how to treat these hard-to-cure diseases. Although various therapies have so far been developed [75], several factors, such as the cost of treatment, the complexity and difficulty of treatment, patient compliance, and so on [76, 77], nonetheless constitute a huge challenge for medical treatment. Without appropriate medical treatments being available, newborns detected positive can only cause families serious economic and emotional stress. It is therefore wise to include some IEMs with a high\nFig. 6 Tornado diagram of newborn screening parametersa, aThe parameters are sorted on the left according to their effect on incremental cost effectiveness ratio.

And, in this case, the ICER of the program is already close to the minimum value. We believe that\u2019s why some countries, such as the UK, South Korea, and Germany, have limited detectable diseases to less than 20. In brief, for the initial implementation of MS/MS screening in Shenzhen, we would suggest utilizing the second policy strategy.\nIn China, while economic evaluations of NBS have been made in many studies [78\u201384], only one has undertaken a cost-effectiveness analysis of MS/MS screening [59]. Most studies have concentrated on the traditional NBS for PKU and/or CH. The benefit\u2013cost ratio ranges between 1:2.38 ~ 1:4.58 for PKU and between 1:3.60 ~ 1:19.94 for CH, demonstrating the economic benefit of traditional NBS. As for the results of the single study focusing on MS/MS screening, these showed the ICUR of MS/MS screening to be -768,429 RMB/QALY (MS/MS screened vs. non-screened) and the BCR was 6.09. That study\u2019s finding of the cost effectiveness of MS/ MS screening is consistent with the result of our study as well as the findings of those studies carried out in other countries [46, 48\u201352].\nThe results of this study are generally robust. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that caution should be taken when the discount rate surpasses 7%. But, statistics indicate that China\u2019s annual inflation rate has remained at around 2% for the past decade (owing to COVID-19, the rate once approached 6%, but remained below 7%) [85]. That is to say, the implementation of MS/MS screening in Shenzhen will be cost-effective for some time\u00a0 to come and likely to be highly cost-effective, since inflation sometimes falls below 1.5%.\nThe findings of the BIA performed demonstrate that no meaningful difference exists among different programs in the whole budget. Given we choose a cost-effective screening program, in every year over the next decade budgets will all reach about 49.33 million RMB. Combining this with the ICER of a program detecting five diseases which reaches the critical value, we can conclude that if the budget of the program covering five diseases is affordable for the Shenzhen administration, it is better to screen for all twelve diseases as per the nationally recommended program. According to the Guidelines for the Treatment of Rare Diseases (2019), there are specific and systematic treatments for these diseases.\nHere, we also considered whether the Shenzhen government could bear the budget as proposed, and the answer is yes. According to the Department Final Report of the Health Commission of Shenzhen in 2018 [86], the budget for public health projects in NBS (including screening for hearing, for IEMs, and for trisomies 21, 18, and 13) was 289.21 million RMB at the beginning of 2018.\nHowever, the final expenditure was 123.73 million RMB, accounting for 42.7% of the budget. This indicates the sufficiency of Shenzhen government funds to finance an expanded program. Moreover, data from Health Statistics Summary of Shenzhen in 2019 [87] show that annual government expenditure on medical treatments and health services increased from 8.332 billion RMB in 2014 to 19.09 billion RMB in 2018, with an annual growth rate of 23.03%, which is much larger than the annual growth rate of the cost of MS/MS newborn screening program.\nAnother of our team\u2019s studies[88], to investigate patients\u2019 willingness to pay (WTP) for the MS/MS screening, revealed the average WTP value was 242 RMB, and that 68.71% (404/588) of families were willing to pay more than 200 RMB. So, the government pricing of the MS/MS screening is truly adjustable and flexible when the WTP value is compared with 20% of the screening cost (average 60.98RMB-79.57RMB per year) that a family should currently be able to afford. And if policymakers are concerned about the risks of health expenditure, it is opportune\u00a0to increase the proportion of out-of-pocket\u00a0 payment to relieve the high-cost burdens of government. Such a policy change would, however, need to be properly considered since the aim of \u201cgradually providing the NBS program free of charge\u201d was proposed in a recent provincial policy. Briefly, the series of data presented above makes the claim that the MS/MS newborn screening program is affordable for the Shenzhen government.\nDue to the lack of epidemiological\u00a0 investigation in China and Shenzhen, the integral local database of IEMs is still extraordinarily wanting. So, in order to solve this bottleneck problem, key recommendations are for research that outlines top priorities to enhance epidemiological studies\u00a0 of IEMs and advance the establishment of the IEMs database in China. Only in this way can we proceed with a cost-effectiveness analysis suiting China\u2019s circumstances and provide further empirical evidence for the NBS program.\nIn this study, we assumed the sensitivity and specificity of MS/MS screening is 100%, implying that this method produces no false positive or false negative results. In fact, even if the accuracy of the technology is sufficiently high, false positives in the practical screening program can still occur. Such occurrences of false positive cases can incur additional costs, including for treatment, confirmation testing and follow-up while creating related stress for families. Taking the example of PKU, a false positive test can cause a loss of about 70,000 RMB every year, not accounting the latent costs of psychological stress. So, what we should concentrate on is screening accuracy and quality management of the whole screening program in the real world."
