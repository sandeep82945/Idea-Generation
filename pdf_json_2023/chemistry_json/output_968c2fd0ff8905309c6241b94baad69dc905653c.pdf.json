    "abstractText": "Biflavonoids are dimeric forms of flavonoids that have recently gained importance as an effective new scaffold for drug discovery. In particular, 3\u2032-8\u2032\u2032-biflavones exhibit antiviral and antimicrobial activity and are promising molecules for the treatment of neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases as well as cancer therapies. In the present study, we directly compared 3\u2032-8\u2032\u2032-biflavones (amentoflavone, bilobetin, ginkgetin, isoginkgetin, and sciadopitysin) and their monomeric subunits (apigenin, genkwanin, and acacetin) and evaluated their radical scavenging activity (with DPPH), antifungal activity against mycotoxigenic fungi (Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus ochraceus, Fusarium graminearum, and Fusarium verticillioides), and inhibitory activity on enzymes (acetylcholinesterase, tyrosinase, \u03b1-amylase, and \u03b1-glucosidase). All the tested compounds showed weak radical scavenging activity, while antifungal activity strongly depended on the tested concentration and fungal species. Biflavonoids, especially ginkgetin and isoginkgetin, proved to be potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, whereas monomeric flavonoids showed higher tyrosinase inhibitory activity than the tested 3\u2032-8\u2032\u2032-biflavones. Amentoflavone proved to be a potent \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1glucosidase inhibitor, and in general, 3\u2032-8\u2032\u2032-biflavones showed a stronger inhibitory potential on these enzymes than their monomeric subunits. Thus, we can conclude that 3\u2032-8\u2032\u2032-dimerization enhanced acetylcholinesterase, \u03b1-amylase, and \u03b1-glucosidase activities, but the activity also depends on the number of hydroxyl and methoxy groups in the structure of the compound.",

            "text": "Flavonoids have been the focus of scientific attention for more than 40 years and 8000 different structures have been described to date [1]. However, they are a large group of specialized metabolites whose biological function in plants and biological activity are strongly influenced by molecular structure [2]. The basic structure of flavonoids is presented in Figure 1a. In general, flavonoids occur as aglycons or in conjugated form. Aglycons are often hydroxylated at the C3, C5, C7, C3\u2032, C4\u2032, and C5\u2032 positions, while some of these hydroxyl groups may also be methylated, acetylated, or sulfated [3]. Prenylation occurs directly on a carbon atom in the aromatic rings, but O-prenylation has also been found [3]. The hydroxylation of C5, C7, C3\u2032, and C4\u2032 and geranylation or prenylation at C6 have been extensively studied to increase the bacterial inhibition of flavonoids, while methoxylation at C3\u2032 and C5 decreases the antibacterial activity of flavonoids [4]. According to a study by Zhang et al. [5], the 2,3-double bond, 4-keto groups, 3\u2032,4\u2032-catechol structure, and 3-hydroxyl in the flavonoid scaffold play an important role in the antioxidant behavior, while the cell proliferation assay showed low cytotoxicity for 3-O-methylquercetin. According to\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1854. https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12101854 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antioxidants\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1854 2 of 13\nBoozari et al. [6], the prenyl group in the C8 position plays an important role in biological effects such as antimicrobial, cytotoxic, enzyme inhibitory, and estrogenic activity. The resveratrol residue (A or B ring) in combination with lavandulyl flavanones in the structure of flavonoids may enhance their cytotoxic effect, while the presence of prenyl groups in any position of the flavonoid backbone may enhance its anti-inflammatory effect [6]. The same group of authors reported that prenylated compounds with flavanone structure and hydroxyl substitution in C3 decreased antibacterial activity but had no effect on cytotoxic activity, while C8 prenylation can increase potent enzyme inhibitory activity, and this effect and C5\u2032-prenylated chalcones with C6\u2032-OH substitution have significant cytotoxic activity. Flavonoids can occur in free form, but in plants, they more commonly occur in conjugated form as flavonoid glycosides, which are conjugated by a bond between flavonoid aglycones and glycosyl groups. The glycosidic bond is located at position C3 or C7, and the carbohydrates are usually L-rhamnose, D-glucose, glucose\u2013rhamnose, galactose, or arabinose [3]. The glycosylation of flavonoids can alter the biological activity of flavonoids, increase water solubility, reduce toxic effects and side effects, and improve specific targeting

can also occur in a dimeric form consisting of two monoflavonoid residues. The basic structure of the 3\u2032-8\u2032\u2032 dimer is presented in Figure 1b. To date, nearly 600 different biflavonoids have been described [8], but little is known about their biosynthesis and precise roles in plants. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence that flavonoid dimers are an effective new scaffold for drug discovery [8\u201313]. They have shown great potential as antimicrobial agents against viruses [14,15] and fungi [16], as well as in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases [17] and cancers [18]. The precise mechanisms through which dimerization affects biological activity and whether this effect exists are not well understood. In this work, we aimed to in estigate how the 3\u2032-8\u2032\u2032-dimerization affects the biological activity of flavonoids. To this nd, we studied their scavenging activity (with DPPH), antifungal acti ity against mycotoxigenic f ngi (A. alternata, A. flavus, A. ochraceus, F. graminearum, nd F. verticillioides) (Figure 2), and inhibitory activity on enzymes (acetylcholi sterase, tyrosinase, \u03b1-amylase, and \u03b1-glucosidase) of five 3\u2032-8\u2032\u2032- biflavones (amentoflavone, bilobet , ginkgetin, nd isoginkgetin) and their monomeric subunits (apigenin, genkwanin, and acac ti ).\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1854 3 of 13Antioxidants\u00a02023,\u00a012,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 3\u00a0

            "text": "Flavonoids are often considered antioxidants, but in reality, their antioxidant activity is highly dependent on the structure of individual flavonoids [26]. This is also evident from our results showing that flavones and biflavones have weak radical scavenging activity using one of the most commonly used methods for measuring antioxidant activity, DPPH. Similar to the results of our experiments, Kang et al. [27] revealed that none of the five biflavones also tested in our study showed radical scavenging activity up to 100 \u00b5M when measured with 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). We tested even higher concentrations and observed no significant activity. This suggests that biflavones do not act as antioxidants or radical scavengers, at least in a cell-free system. Research findings also show that the biflavones amentoflavone, bilobetin, ginkgetin, and sciadopitysin are the weakest antioxidants among the 30 compounds isolated from ginkgo tested in myelomonocytic HL-60 cells [28]. However, there are some conflicting data on the antioxidant activity of biflavones. For example, Li et al. [29] compared the antioxidant activity of acacetin and its 3\u2032,8\u2032\u2032 dimer isoginkgetin using three methods, the O2\u2212 scavenging assay, the Cu2+ reducing assay, and the 2,2\u2032-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging assay, and reported that the 3\u2032,8\u2032\u2032-dimerization increased the antioxidant capacity of flavonoids. From all these findings, we can conclude that the antioxidant activity of biflavones is still very poorly understood, and further studies should clarify their activity as antioxidants. Monomeric flavonoids have been shown to be effective antifungal agents against a variety of pathogenic organisms through mechanisms that include the disruption of the plasma membrane; the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction; and the inhibition of cell wall formation, cell division, RNA and protein synthesis, and efflux-mediated pumping [30]. Herein, we tested compounds for their potential inhibition against five mycotoxigenic fungi that are perhaps the most important pathogens of global concern in the context of food safety. They can affect the quality and quantity of marketable products by damaging foods such as corn, wheat, and peanuts and producing mycotoxin metabolites that can be carcinogenic and affect human and animal health [31]. According to our results, antifungal activity depends on both the fungi used and the tested concentration. The genus Fusarium generates a number of mycotoxins that can cause acute or chronic disease and, in some cases, death [32]. At the lowest concentration, 0.01 \u00b5g/mL, all the tested compounds showed significant inhibition against F. graminearum, and biflavonoids showed higher inhibition than the monomers analyzed. When we directly compared amentoflavone with its monomeric subunits apigenin, we found that amentoflavone had a stronger inhibition against F. graminearum, which may indicate that the 3\u2032-8\u2032\u2032-dimerization increases the antifungal activity against this fungus. In the case of F. verticillioides, all biflavonoids and apigenin showed inhibition at a higher concentration (10 \u00b5g/mL). Krauze-Baranowska and Wiwart [16] investigated the antifungal activity of amentoflavone, bilobetin, ginkgetin, and sciadopitysin against F. culmorum, and at a concentration of 100 \u00b5M/mL, bilobetin, ginkgetin, and sciadopitysin showed 100% inhibition. It has also been reported that the extracts of Hypericum triquetrifolium have antifungal activity against Fusarium sp. [33], and Hypericum sp. are known to contain biflavonoids [34]. Taken together, these findings indicate that the biflavonoids tested here can be potential inhibitors of Fusarium sp. Other mycotoxigenic fungi we tested belong to Aspergillus sp., namely A. flavus and A. ochraceus. All the tested biflavonoids, as well as genkwanin, showed antifungal activity against A. ochraceus, which was higher at lower concentrations and decreased with the increase in concentration, whereas for A. flavus, activity increased with concentration for most biflavonoids. Previously, isoginkgetin was reported to have inhibitory activity against A. fumigatus [35]. Gon\u00e7alez et al. [36] reported in their study that amentoflavone inhibited the production of aflatoxin B1 and B2 by A. flavus but did not inhibit fungal growth at the concentration tested. They indicated that biflavonoids may be effective agents for controlling aflatoxin production without inhibiting growth. All the compounds we tested here showed weak or no inhibition against A. alternata at concentrations up to 10 \u00b5g/mL.\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1854 10 of 13\nKrauze-Baranowska and Wiwart [16] investigated antifungal activity at a higher concentration of 100 \u00b5M and showed that ginkgetin had 100% inhibition against A. alternata, while the inhibition of amentoflavone, bilobetin, and sciadopitysin was 54%, 80%, and 59%, respectively. For the enzyme inhibitory activities of our compounds, we selected four enzymes that are involved in important metabolic functions. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors are widely used for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other dementias because the inhibition of AChE slows the hydrolysis of acetylcholine and increases choline levels, which improves cognitive function. Monomeric flavonoids have been recognized as AchE inhibitors for several decades [37]. According to our results, at a concentration of 100 \u00b5M, ginkgetin and isoginkgetin had significantly higher inhibitory effects on acetylcholinesterase than the other compounds analyzed. These results are not surprising because ginkgetin and isoginkgetin are characteristic compounds of Ginkgo biloba L. [9,28,38], a plant used to treat cognitive disorders, and ginkgetin is known to be a potential neuprotectant [17]. The inhibition of tyrosinase is related to the potential use of compounds to reduce melanogenesis activity and alleviate hyperpigmentation [39]. According to our results, all three monomeric flavonoids, i.e., apigenin, genkwanin, and acacetin, showed significantly higher inhibitory activity than the biflavones studied. Among the biflavonoids, amentoflavone showed higher inhibitory activity. According to the molecular docking study by Ogunwa [40], amentoflavone has moderate tyrosinase inhibitory potential, which is also evident in our study. We also investigated the inhibitory activity against \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase, the two enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. The inhibition of these enzymes may help regulate blood glucose levels and prevent/control diabetes mellitus [23]. According to our results, amentoflavone is the best \u03b1-amylase inhibitor, followed by isoginkgetin. Ametoflavone has already been recognized as a potent \u03b1-amylase inhibitor, and its possible mechanism of action involves the occupation of the catalytic site and other regions of the enzyme as well as the inhibition of the substrate\u2019s access and binding [40]. Peterson et al. [41] studied bilobetin, isoginkgetin, ginkgetin, and sciadopitysin isolated from a ginkgo for their \u03b1-amylase inhibitory activity. They found that bilobetin had no clear inhibitory effect, whereas, in the other components, the inhibitory effect decreased with the increase in concentration, and it was most pronounced for sciadopitysin, which they characterized as an \u03b1-amylase activator rather than an inhibitor. These results are consistent with our results where sciadopitysin showed the least inhibitory effect on \u03b1-amylase. In the case of \u03b1-glucosidase, amentoflavone showed complete inhibition under the concentration tested, followed by isoginkgetin and ginkgetin. Amentoflavone is already known to be a potent \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor. Swargiary et al. [42] investigated \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity via the molecular docking of 155 different phenolic compounds and found that amentoflavone had the strongest binding affinity with \u03b1-glucosidase, much stronger than the reference acarbose. Similarly, Li et al. [43] investigated the inhibitory effects of amentoflavone and monomeric apigenin on \u03b1-glucosidase and reported a stronger inhibitory effect of amentoflavone, which is also reflected in our results. Flavonoids are noncompetitive inhibitors of \u03b1-glucosidase and have shown synergistic inhibitory effects with acarbose [43], an \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor used in conjunction with diet and exercise to control blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

All the tested compounds showed weak radical scavenging activity. The antifungal activity strongly depends on the fungi used and the concentration. At some concentrations, we\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1854 11 of 13\neven detected growth-promoting activity, as in the case of F. verticillioides. At the lowest concentration, 0.01 \u00b5g/mL, all the analyzed compounds showed significant inhibition against F. graminearum, and the biflavonoids showed higher inhibition than the tested monomers. The antifungal activity against A. ochraceus was higher for all biflavonoids and genkwanin at lower concentrations and decreased with the increase in concentration, while all biflavonoids showed antifungal activity against A. flavus, and the activity increased with concentration for most biflavonoids. Biflavonoids showed weak activities against A. alterata, while apigenin and genkwanin showed no antifungal activity. Isoginkgetin and ginkgetin showed the highest inhibition against acetylcholinesterase, while monomeric compounds showed higher inhibitory activity against tyrosinase. Amentoflavone proved to be a potent inhibitor of \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase, and the 3\u2032-8\u2032\u2032-biflavones tested showed higher inhibitory activity against \u03b1-glucosidase than their monomeric subunits. From all these results, we can conclude that the 3\u2032-8\u2032\u2032-dimerization affects the biological activity, such as the antifungal activity against F. graminearum, where the biflavonoids showed higher inhibitory activity than the tested monomers. Also, the inhibitory activity against \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase is enhanced by 3\u2032-8\u2032\u2032-dimerization but is also influenced by the number of methoxy and hydroxyl groups.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, D.\u0160.; methodology, I.J.\u0160., B.\u0160. and D.\u0160.; validation, I.J.\u0160., B.\u0160. and D.\u0160.; investigation, I.J.\u0160., B.\u0160. and D.\u0160.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, D.\u0160.; writing\u2014review and editing, D.\u0160. and E.K.; visualization, D.\u0160.; supervision, D.\u0160.; project administration, D.\u0160.; funding acquisition, D.\u0160.
