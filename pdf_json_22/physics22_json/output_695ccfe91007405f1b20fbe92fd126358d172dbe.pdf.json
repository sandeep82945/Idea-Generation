    "abstractText": "We formulate a new quantization principle for perturbative quantum field theory, based on a minimally non time-ordered product, and show that it gives the theories of physical particles and purely virtual particles. Given a classical Lagrangian, the quantization proceeds as usual, guided by the time-ordered product, up to the common scattering matrix S, which satisfies a unitarity or a pseudounitarity equation. The physical scattering matrix Sph is built from S, by gluing S diagrams together into new diagrams, through non time-ordered propagators. We classify the most general way to gain unitarity by means of such operations, and point out that a special solution \u201cminimizes\u201d the time-ordering violation. We show that the scattering matrix Sph given by this solution coincides with the one obtained by turning the would-be ghosts (and possibly some would-be physical particles) into purely virtual particles (fakeons). We study tricks to descend and ascend in a unique way among diagrams, and illustrate them in several examples: the ascending chain from the bubble to the hexagon, at one loop; the box with diagonal, at two loops; other diagrams, with more loops.",

            "text": "Unitarity is a fundamental principle of quantum field theory. It states that the scattering matrix S satisfies the unitarity equation S\u2020S = 1. Equivalently, the T matrix defined by S = 1 + iT satisfies the optical theorem\niT \u2212 iT \u2020 = \u2212T \u2020T. (1.1)\nThe virtue of this formula is that it can be converted into Cutkosky-Veltman identities [1\u20136], which are diagrammatic relations, satisfied by each diagram separately. The diagrams of T are built by means of the usual vertices and propagators. The diagrams of T \u2020 are built by means of the conjugate vertices and the conjugate propagators. The diagrams of T \u2020T have two sides, one for T \u2020 and one for T , separated by a \u201ccut\u201d. The product between T \u2020 and T is rendered diagrammatically by means of \u201ccut propagators\u201d, which are on shell and encode the physical contents of the theory. Thus, while the matrix T is given by the usual Feynman diagrams, the identity (1.1) involves the larger class of Cutkosky-Veltman diagrams, which are also called \u201ccut diagrams\u201d. It was shown in ref. [7] that the identities obeyed by the \u201cskeletons\u201d of the diagrams (where we ignore the integrals on the space components of the loop momenta), split into independent spectral optical identities, one for every (multi)threshold. The virtue of these relations is that they are algebraic and relatively straightforward to manipulate. Moreover, they provide the threshold decomposition of a diagram, which can be used to quantize the would-be ghosts, and possibly some would-be physical particles, as purely virtual particles, thereby projecting the matrix T onto a reduced matrix Tph, which may be physically acceptable even if T is not. Purely virtual particles, also called fake particles, or fakeons, are defined by this new diagrammatics [7]. The projection allows us to remove degrees of freedom from the physical spectrum at all energies, and satisfy the optical theorem in a manifest way. The main application of the idea is the formulation of a consistent theory of quantum gravity [8], which is observationally testable due to its predictions in inflationary cosmology [9]. At the phenomenological level, fakeons evade common constraints that limit the employment of normal particles (see [10] and references therein). In this paper, we study the scattering matrix of quantum field theory under a new light. We inquire what transformations we can make on the usual S matrix, which is defined by the time-ordered product, to turn it into a different scattering matrix Sph, possibly better suited to describe the physics we observe in experiments. We end up by uncovering purely virtual particles again, in an independent way. The results confirm and upgrade the ones of [7] and provide an alternative understanding of the concept of purely virtuality. Unitarity is not an automatic consequence of the usual quantization principle, and should not be taken for granted. For example, if we start from a theory that contains fields with negative kinetic terms, and quantize it as usual, we obtain a matrix T that is not physically acceptable, because it does not satisfy the unitarity equation (1.1). Even in that case, though, T satisfies a mathematically useful identity, which reads [3\u20136]\niT \u2212 iT \u2020 = \u2212T \u2020CT (1.2)\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\nand is called pseudounitarity equation, where C is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues equal to 1, \u22121 and possibly 0 (if auxiliary fields are present). Higher-derivative theories are typical examples of theories satisfying (1.2) with C 6= I. Normally, the quantization ends with the S matrix, which means that if T = i \u2212 iS is physically unacceptable the theory is discarded. What if the quantization did not end there? What if the derivation of T were just the first step of a longer, more elaborate quantization procedure? To make this happen, we need a new quantization principle, equivalent to the old one whenever the old one was successful, but possibly differing from it in every other case. In particular, it should contemplate a second step, defined by new diagrammatic rules, and a map T \u2192 Tph from the \u201cinterim\u201d matrix T satisfying (1.2), to the \u201cfinalized\u201d, hopefully physical, matrix Tph, satisfying (1.1). The first task is to classify all the possibilities we have to build a unitary scattering matrix Sph = 1 + iTph from another unitary scattering matrix, or from a pseudounitary one, S = 1 + iT . Since the time-ordered product leads to the usual S matrix, and leaves no room for alternatives, the second part of the new quantization principle must be based on non time-ordered products. The set of solutions to the problem just stated is large, but a very special one can be singled out among the others. It is the one that minimizes, so to speak, the violation of the time ordering. A bonus is that it provides an alternative way to uncover the physics of purely virtual particles.\nThe new quantization principle. We briefly describe the new diagrammatics, and state the quantization principle they lead to. If \u03d5 denotes the fields, the diagrams of the physical matrix Tph are built by means of the usual vertices, the usual (time-ordered) free-field propagators\n\u30080|\u03b8(x0 \u2212 y0)\u03d5(x)\u03d5(y) + \u03b8(y0 \u2212 x0)\u03d5(y)\u03d5(x)|0\u30090 (1.3)\nand the non time-ordered free-field propagators\n\u30080|\u03d5(x)\u03d5(y)|0\u30090. (1.4)\nThe rules to build the diagrams with these ingredients are encoded into a compact formula, which is eq. (2.16) of section 2, and an iterative procedure to eliminate a certain arbitrariness \u2126 contained in that same formula. Curiously enough, the non time-ordered propagators (1.4) coincide with the cut propagators mentioned earlier. However, the cut propagators are not used to build the T diagrams, which define the ordinary transition amplitudes. They appear in the CutkoskyVeltman diagrams, when we study the (pseudo)unitarity equations (1.1) and (1.2) obeyed by T . Specifically, they connect T \u2020 and T through the products appearing on the righthand sides of those equations. The first, crucial novelty of the new diagrammatics is that the non time-ordered propagators (1.4) are ingredients of the diagrams that give the physical transition amplitudes, collected in Tph. This way, the physical scattering matrix Sph = 1 + iTph is no longer dictated by the time-ordered product. The inclusion of non time-ordered propagators multiplies the number of diagrams we have to consider by a large\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\nfactor. However, the new diagrams are not more difficult than the usual ones, and their large number can be easily dealt with by means of computer programs, like the popular ones used nowadays in phenomenology [11\u201317]. Briefly, the usual diagrams contributing to T are glued together in certain, prescribed ways, by means of the non time-ordered propagators, to build the new diagrams, those of Tph. A certain formula mapping the standard matrix T to the physical matrix Tph, and a certain procedure, guide the assembly of the new diagrams. The new quantization principle is thus made of two parts. The first part amounts to build the matrix T as usual. The second part amounts to work out the physical matrix Tph as explained. The map T \u2192 Tph is sometimes called \u201cprojection\u201d, other times \u201creduction\u201d, interchangeably. We show that the most general reduced matrix T\u2126 built from T , which obeys the unitarity equation, depends on an arbitrary anti-Hermitian matrix \u2126. A special \u2126 is singled out by requiring that the projection of a product diagram is equal to the product of the projected factors, and the factorization survives basic diagrammatic operations. Due to the violation of time ordering, this factorization requirement is nontrivial. It amounts to assume that the violation is a \u201cminimum\u201d one, rather than the most brutal one: it is confined inside non factorizable diagrams, which we call \u201cprime\u201d diagrams. The reason why we call it minimum violation is that it does not seem possible to violate it less than this. With this particular choice of \u2126, the large number of diagrams collapses to an amount that is comparable to the one generated by the usual time-ordered product. We show that the reduced matrix T\u2126 obtained this way coincides with the matrix Tph of a theory of physical and purely virtual particles, as given in ref. [7]. Once we decide which particles we want to quantize as physical and which ones we want to quantize as purely virtual, Tph follows uniquely. We briefly mention the other results of the paper. We work out a number of tricks to descend from bigger to smaller diagrams, but also ascend in a unique way from smaller to bigger diagrams, and relate their \u2126 corrections and their threshold decompositions. We illustrate these properties in various examples. At one loop, we study the ascending chain\nbubble\u2192 triangle\u2192 box\u2192 penthagon\u2192 hexagon.\nAt two loops, we focus on the first nontrivial arrangement, which is the box diagram with diagonal. Classes of diagrams with arbitrarily many loops are also discussed. Agreement with the formulas of [7] is found in every example. A diagram may need an overall \u2126 correction, but also inherit \u2126 corrections from its subdiagrams. In all the cases we consider, nontrivial corrections are present when the diagram is not prime, and also when it is prime, but factorizes under the contraction of some internal legs. We find that it is always possible to ascend through the threshold decompositions in a unique way. We conjecture that these are general properties of the physical matrix Tph. Since the time-ordered product is not a physical principle, we should be open to the possibility that the physical laws may break it, one way or another. Purely virtual particles provide the most elegant and economic way of implementing such a breaking. In physical\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\napplications, purely virtual particles are expected to be massive, and generically heavy. For example, one spin-2 purely virtual particle \u03c7\u00b5\u03bd of mass m\u03c7 \u223c1012\u221213 GeV is enough to make sense of quantum gravity [8]. In that case, the violation of time ordering is restricted to distances . 1/m\u03c7, and so is the violation of microcausality associated with it (as well as the violation of microlocality, when \u03c7\u00b5\u03bd is integrated out). Tiny violations like these are not detectable in realistic situations, even if we take into account the possibility of boosting the systems. We also recall that purely virtual particles in curved space lead to a sharp prediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio r in primordial cosmology (0.0004 . r . 0.0035 [9]). The first observational results on this are expected to become available in the present decade [18]. The results of this paper provide a quantization, in perturbation theory, of any theory for which the usual Feynman diagram calculation of the T matrix gives a result satisfying (1.2). In particular, no assumption about gauge invariance is used. This means that we can make sense of a very wide class of theories usually thought unacceptable. Many workers in quantum field theory believe that negative probability modes can only be removed if the theory has a gauge invariance, and that the physical states are selected through that symmetry. The construction of this paper provides counterexamples to that belief. Ultimately, the correctness of the new ideas must be proven by experiment, for example by confirming the prediction for r, or the viability of standard model extensions such as the one of [19]. If theories constructed with these methods turn out to be phenomenologically correct, then we need to expand our orthodox ideas about fundamental physics. Further insight on this aspect could come from the investigation of an important open problem, that is to say, establish whether the S matrix generated by the prescription for purely virtual particles is the result of a Hamiltonian evolution, as we normally understand it, or we need to relax the basic axioms of quantum mechanics. Although this issue is beyond the scope of this paper, it ought to be explored. The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we work out the most general map that converts a matrix T satisfying the (pseudo)unitarity equation (1.2) into a reduced matrix Tred that satisfies the unitarity equation (1.1). In section 3 we outline the basic rules for the new diagrams. In sections 4 and 5, we discuss the reduction T \u2192 Tred in the cases of tree and disconnected diagrams. In section 6 we study the simplest one-loop diagrams (bubble, triangle and box). In section 7 we study diagrams with more loops, focusing on the box with diagonal, which is the first truly new arrangement. In section 8 we discuss a number of tools to have control on pure virtuality, and relate smaller and bigger diagrams. In section 9 we explain how to use those tricks to ascend and descend through the diagrams and their threshold decompositions. In section 10 we summarize the diagrammatic rules, and compare the main options (Feynman diagrams, CutkoskyVeltman diagrams, and the diagrams defined here), and their uses. In section 11 we show that the projection preserves the global and local symmetries of a theory, the cancellation of anomalies and the renormalizability. Section 12 contains the conclusions. In appendix A we explain how to switch from the scattering matrix to single diagrams, without loss of information, and vice versa, to derive the diagrammatic identities. In appendix B we prove some identities for product distributions, used in the paper.\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8"

            "text": "In this section we describe how to reduce the scattering matrix of a possibly nonunitary theory to a unitary scattering matrix. We classify the set of solutions without assuming physical inputs.\nWe decompose the usual S matrix as\nS = 1 + V, (2.1)\nwhere V = iT , and T collects the common transition amplitudes, defined by the timeordered product. From now on, we refer to V , or, more generally, the difference between a scattering matrix and the identity matrix, by simply calling it \u201camplitude\u201d.\nThe unitarity of the S matrix, i.e., the identity S\u2020S = 1, gives the identity\nV + V \u2020 = \u2212V \u2020V (2.2)\nfor the amplitude V . Various quantum field theories do not allow us to prove an equation of this form right away. When the theory has fields with negative kinetic terms, we can just prove a pseudounitarity equation\nV + V \u2020 = \u2212V \u2020CV, (2.3)\nwhere C is some Hermitian matrix. We can diagonalize and normalize C so as to put it into the form\ndiag( n+\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 1, n\u2212\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 \u22121, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\u22121, n0\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 0). (2.4)\nThe corresponding Fock space decomposition is written as W = W+\u2295W\u2212\u2295W0, where W is the total Fock space. A quick derivation of (2.3) from (2.2) goes on as follows. We integrate out the auxiliary fields, for simplicity, and use \u03d5\u0302 to denote the fields that have negative kinetic terms. If, for a moment, we change the signs of the \u03d5\u0302 propagators, we obtain a modified theory that satisfies (2.2). Consider a diagram G of the modified theory, and the diagrammatic equation satisfied by it, generated by (2.2). If we multiply that equation by a factor (\u22121)nG , where nG denotes the number of the \u03d5\u0302 legs, we restore the factors of the original theory in front of the propagators of the internal \u03d5\u0302 legs due to V \u2020 and V . However, the cut \u03d5\u0302 legs connecting V \u2020 and V also get factors (\u22121). This converts the unit matrix I between V \u2020 and V into the matrix C, leading to formula (2.3). Our goal is to project the amplitude V and the space W , so as to obtain an equation like (2.2) from (2.3), holding in a \u201cphysical\u201d subspace Wph of W . Let\n\u03a0ph = diag( Nph\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 1, Npv\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 0), (2.5)\ndenote the projector onto Wph, and W = Wph\u2295Wpv the corresponding W decomposition, where Nph 6 n+, Npv = n+ +n\u2212+n0\u2212Nph. It is enough to find a reduced amplitude Vred that solves the equation\nVred + V \u2020red = \u2212V \u2020 red\u03a0phVred. (2.6)\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\nIndeed, this equation implies that the physical amplitude Vph \u2261 \u03a0phVred\u03a0ph solves\nVph + V \u2020ph = \u2212V \u2020 phVph, (2.7)\nso the physical S matrix Sph \u2261 \u03a0ph + Vph satisfies S\u2020phSph = \u03a0ph. In other words, if we manage to solve (2.6), we achieve unitarity in the subspace Wph. Then we can legitimately claim that Vph is the physical amplitude, and Wph is physical space of the theory. Summarizing, our goal is to find the most general solution Vred of (2.6), given the physical projector \u03a0ph. We can generalize the problem a little bit with no effort: given Hermitian matrices C and A, and given a matrix V that satisfies (2.3), we want to find the most general solution Vred of the equation\nVred + V \u2020red = \u2212V \u2020 redAVred. (2.8)\nThis is a merely mathematical problem about matrices, and A, C do not need to be projectors or linear combinations of projectors. For convenience, we write\nB = C \u2212A. (2.9)\nA particular solution of (2.8) is Vred = V0, where\nV0 = ( 1 + 12V B )\u22121 V. (2.10)\nThis formula can be understood recursively as\nV0 = V \u2212 1 2V BV0 = V \u2212 1 2V BV + 1 4V BV BV + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .\nNote that, despite its appearance, the solution is left-right symmetric, since we can also write\nV0 = V \u2212 1 2V0BV = V \u2212 1 4V0BV \u2212 1 4V BV0.\nThe proof that (2.10) solves V0 + V \u20200 = \u2212V \u2020\n0 AV0 follows straightforwardly from the identities\nV \u2020 = \u2212V (1 + CV )\u22121 , V \u20200 = \u2212V ( 1 +AV + 12BV )\u22121 , (2.11)\nwhich are implied by (2.3) and then (2.10). Starting from the particular solution (2.10), we can write the most general solution Vred as Vred = V0 + \u21260. (2.12)\nIn order to fulfill (2.10), the matrix \u21260 must satisfy the equation\n\u21260 + \u2126\u20200 = \u2212V \u2020 0 A\u21260 \u2212 \u2126 \u2020 0AV0 \u2212 \u2126 \u2020 0A\u21260. (2.13)\nAs before, we can solve this equation recursively in powers of V0, starting from an arbitrary anti-Hermitian matrix \u2126\u0303 that is at least of order V0. Indeed, if we write \u21260 = \u2126\u0303 + \u2206\u2126,\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\nwith \u2126\u0303 + \u2126\u0303\u2020 = 0 and assume that \u2206\u2126 is of higher order in the expansion, we obtain the equation\n\u2206\u2126 + \u2206\u2126\u2020 = \u2212\u2126\u20200A\u21260 \u2212 V \u2020 0 A\u21260 \u2212 \u2126 \u2020 0AV0,\nwhich can be solved iteratively as claimed. This also proves that the matrix \u2126\u0303 parametrizes the most general solution of (2.13).\nIt is simple to show that the explicit solution \u21260 of (2.13), and its inverse, are\n\u21260 = ( 1\u2212 12\u2126\u0303A )\u22121 \u2126\u0303 (1 +AV0) , \u2126\u0303 = \u21260 ( 1 + 12A\u21260 +AV0 )\u22121 . (2.14)\nThe proof follows by writing (2.13) in the form E + E\u2020 = 0, where\nE = \u2126\u20200 ( 1 + 12A\u21260 +AV0 ) .\nUsing the expression (2.14) of \u21260, and \u2126\u0303\u2020 = \u2212\u2126\u0303, we see that the matrix\nE = \u2212 ( 1 + V \u20200 A )( 1 + 12\u2126\u0303A )\u22121 \u2126\u0303 ( 1\u2212 12A\u2126\u0303 )\u22121 (1 +AV0)\nis indeed anti-Hermitian. The solution (2.12), with V0 given in (2.10) and \u21260 given in (2.14), needs some rearrangement, since it is not written in a manifestly left-right symmetric form. The symmetrization can be obtained by redefining \u2126\u0303 within the realm of its own arbitrariness. Define\n\u2126 = (1 + V0A)\u22121/2 \u2126\u0303 (1 +AV0)1/2 . (2.15)\nIt is easy to prove that \u2126 is anti-Hermitian. To this purpose, note that, since Vred = V0 solves (2.8), we have the formula\nV \u20200 = \u2212V0 (1 +AV0) \u22121 .\nEquipped with (2.15), the first expression of (2.14) can be recast into the form\n\u21260 = (1 + V0A)1/2 ( 1\u2212 12\u2126A )\u22121 \u2126 (1 +AV0)1/2 ,\nwhich is manifestly left-right symmetric. Then, so is (2.12). Going back to formula (2.12) and summarizing the results we have found so far, we have proved that, given a matrix V that satisfies\nV + V \u2020 = \u2212V \u2020AV \u2212 V \u2020BV,\nwhere A and B are arbitrary Hermitian matrices, the most general matrix Vred that satisfies\nVred + V \u2020red = \u2212V \u2020 redAVred\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\nand coincides with V up to corrections of higher orders in V itself, is Vred = V\u2126(A,B), where\nV\u2126(A,B) = ( 1 + 12V B )\u22121 V\n+ ( 1 + ( 1 + 12V B )\u22121 V A )1/2 ( 1\u2212 12\u2126A )\u22121 \u2126 ( 1 +AV ( 1 + 12BV )\u22121)1/2\n(2.16)\nand \u2126 is an arbitrary anti-Hermitian matrix, to be considered of order two in V , or higher. Formula (2.16) is the key formula of the paper. An interesting case is when the physical spaceWph is just made of the vacuum state |0\u3009. Then A is |0\u3009\u30080| andB is C\u2212|0\u3009\u30080|. If C has the form (2.4), the solution V\u2126(|0\u3009\u30080|, C\u2212|0\u3009\u30080|) can be used to remove the whole on-shell contents of the diagrams, and describe the situation where every particle is rendered purely virtual. To achieve this goal, \u2126 must be determined so as to remove any residual on-shell contributions. As we are going to show in the next sections, this is a nontrivial task, but has a well defined answer. Unfortunately, the answer is not just \u2126 = 0. Indeed, the \u2126 = 0 solution\nV\u030a \u2261 V0(|0\u3009\u30080|, C \u2212 |0\u3009\u30080|) \u2261 ( 1 + 12V (C \u2212 |0\u3009\u30080|) )\u22121 V (2.17)\nturns out to be correct only in a certain subset of simpler diagrams. In general, a nonvanishing \u2126 is to be expected. We will show that the solution V\u2126(|0\u3009\u30080|, C \u2212 |0\u3009\u30080|), equipped with the right \u2126, provides an alternative way to make the threshold decomposition of [7]. By affinity with the notion of prime number, we say that a diagram is prime if it cannot be factorized as a nontrivial product of smaller diagrams, in momentum space. We show that, for arbitrary A, \u2126 can be chosen to make V\u2126 obey the following factorization property: the projection of a non prime diagram is the product of the projections of its prime factors, and the factorization survives basic operations of ascent and descent among diagrams. This is a nontrivial requirement, in the realm of non time-ordered products. We also show that the amplitude V\u2126 determined by this \u2126 gives precisely the diagrams of physical and purely virtual particles, as per ref. [7]. We identify such a V\u2126 with the physical amplitude Vph.\nWe first proceed by explicit examples, then gather the lessons we learn along the way."

            "heading": "3 Diagrams: the old and the new",
            "text": "In this section we lay out the rules to build the new diagrams, and compare them with the Feynman rules. So far, we have been merely playing with matrices: the theorems proved in the previous section hold under assumptions that are more general than the ones we need for physical applications. To move forward towards the physics, let \u03a6 = {\u03d5, \u03c7} collect all the fields, which include the physical fields \u03d5 and the fields \u03c7 we want to project away (for one reason or another). The physical subspace Wph contains the vacuum state |0\u3009 and the states that are built by means of the \u03d5 creation operators, but no \u03c7 creation operators. The\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\ncomplementary subspace Wpv contains the states that are built by means of at least one \u03c7 creation operator. The idea is that a single excitation due to the fields that we want to get rid of is sufficient to drop the whole state from the physical spectrum. From our definition (2.1), it follows that the amplitude V collects the usual Feynman diagrams. In operatorial notation,\nV = T exp ( \u2212i \u222b +\u221e \u2212\u221e HI(t)dt ) \u2212 1, (3.1)\nwhere HI is the interaction Hamiltonian and T denotes the time-ordered product. The V diagrams are defined by the usual Feynman rules. In particular, the \u03d5 free-field propagators are the time-ordered ones, given by the Feynman i prescription. For scalars \u03d5, we have\n\u30080|T \u03d5(x)\u03d5(y)|0\u30090 = \u222b d4p\n(2\u03c0)4 e \u2212ip(x\u2212y) i p2 \u2212m2 + i . (3.2)\nThe propagators of the \u03c7 fields are the same, apart from the possibility of being multiplied by minus signs. Thus, \u03c7 scalars may have propagators\n\u30080|T \u03c7(x)\u03c7(y)|0\u30090 = \u222b d4p\n(2\u03c0)4 e \u2212ip(x\u2212y) (\u00b1i) p2 \u2212m2 + i , (3.3)\nThe 0 eigenvalues of the matrix C of (2.4) correspond to auxiliary fields \u03c7. From now on, we assume that they are integrated away. The right-hand side \u2212V \u2020CV of formula (2.3) collects the usual Cutkosky-Veltman diagrams, which are graphically rendered by means cut diagrams. The cut is unique, and represents the matrix C separating V \u2020 from V . While the V diagrams are time-ordered, and the V \u2020 diagrams are anti-time-ordered, the product V \u2020CV is just a plain (non timeordered) product of field operators. This means that, when we apply Wick\u2019s theorem, the Wick contraction between a field \u03a6(x) that belongs to a conjugate vertex v\u03041 of V \u2020, and a field \u03a6(y) that belongs to an ordinary vertex v2 of V is the non time-ordered two-point function\n\u30080|\u03a6(x)\u03a6(y)|0\u30090 = \u00b1 \u222b d3p\n(2\u03c0)32\u03c9 e \u2212ip(x\u2212y) = \u00b1 \u222b d4p (2\u03c0)4 (2\u03c0)\u03b8(p 0)\u03b4(p2\u2212m2)e\u2212ip(x\u2212y), (3.4)\nwhere the sign is + or \u2212 according to the sign of the C eigenvalue associated with \u03a6, as in (3.2) and (3.3). In momentum space these \u201ccut propagators\u201d are thus\n\u00b1 (2\u03c0)\u03b8(p0)\u03b4(p2 \u2212m2). (3.5)\nNow we describe the diagrams of the reduced amplitude V\u2126. We assume that A is the projector \u03a0ph onto the physical space Wph, C has the form (2.4), and B = C \u2212 A. The V\u2126 diagrams follow from formula (2.16), by expanding the right-hand side in powers of V . Each term of the expansion is graphically represented as a cut diagram, multiplied by a coefficient inherited from the expansion itself. We must distinguish two types of cuts, standing for the matrices A and B. A V\u2126 diagram may contain an arbitrary number of such cuts.\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\nIt is convenient to draw the cuts as vertical lines and place the vertices in the strips between pairs of consecutive cuts, and in the half planes located at the sides. Every strip, or half plane, must contain at least one vertex. The vertices and the uncut propagators of the V\u2126 diagrams coincide with those of V . In particular, no conjugate vertices, nor conjugate propagators, are involved. As above, a line crossed by a cut stands for the propagator (3.5), the energy flowing conventionally from the right to the left. The cut propagator contributes to A, or B, depending on whether the field \u03a6 of (3.4) belongs to the subset of physical fields \u03d5, or the subset of fields \u03c7 we want to project away. A cut A can only cut \u03d5 legs, while a cut B must cut at least one \u03c7 leg. The diagrams we consider in the examples of the next sections have a different particle on each internal leg. In appendix A we show that we can always enlarge the set of fields enough to fit this arrangement, with no gain nor loss of information, by means of a PauliVillars trick [20]. Diagrams with internal legs associated with the same \u03d5, or the same \u03c7, can be seen as particular cases. We distinguish the various fields \u03d5 and \u03c7 by means of indices i, and write \u03a6 = {\u03d5i, \u03c7i}. It is easy to show that the diagrams where every \u03c7i appears an even number of times to the right (left) of a B cut vanish. Indeed, the Wick contraction makes the creation and annihilation operators of all the \u03c7 fields disappear to the right (left) of that cut. This means that only creation and annihilation operators of physical fields \u03d5i act on |0\u3009 (\u30080|) before B. Since B vanishes on the physical space Wph, we obtain something like \u30080|(physical fields \u03d5i)B, or B( physical fields \u03d5i)|0\u3009, which vanish as well. Once we decide what theory we want to build, we have the physical space Wph, and know what fields \u03c7 we want to project away. This means that we have the matrix A, which is the projector onto Wph, as well as the matrix B, which is equal to C \u2212 A. At that point, we are ready to study the V\u2126 diagrams encoded in (2.16). Although they are a large number, there is no difficulty to list them by means of computer software. What can we obtain with a generic \u2126? In principle, anything we want. We can even jump from the S matrix of one theory, say the \u03d54 theory, to the S matrix of a completely different theory, say the standard model. The identities proved in the previous section are general properties of matrices, with no constraints from physics. In physical applications, \u2126 cannot be completely arbitrary. For example, it should be at least O(V 2), as mentioned right after formula (2.16). Moreover, it should not change the basic contents of the theory. This requirement can be phrased more precisely by stating that: it should not change the Euclidean version of the theory; equivalently, it should not change the zeroth level of the threshold decomposition of diagrams (see the beginning of section 6). Finally, \u2126 cannot introduce singularities that are not present in the Feynman diagrams (such as new thresholds, or new types of singular behaviors around existing thresholds). A particular solution V\u2126 must give the diagrammatics of physical and purely virtual particles, derived in ref. [7]. Indeed, the diagrams defined there also solve the problem of building a unitary matrix Tph out of the ordinary (pseudo)unitary matrix T . Thus, there must exist an \u2126 that makes the V\u2126 diagrams coincide with those of [7]. Unfortunately, such an \u2126 is not just \u2126 = 0, nor something comparably simple, but must be worked out iteratively. The examples studied in the next sections tell us how, and make us appreciate what makes the solution of [7] so special.\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\nThe operations we have described are not all straightforward, so we must spend some time to describe them in detail, starting from the connected tree diagrams and the product diagrams, to conclude with the loop diagrams. We mostly work with plus signs in front of the propagators (3.3) and (3.5), which means C = I = \u2211 n |n\u3009\u3008n|, where |n\u3009 is an orthonormal basis of states. The other cases are easily obtained by flipping overall signs in front of formulas and identities."

This helps us illustrate the meaning of the various formulas and their ingredients.\nThe simplest example is the free propagator. We take the interaction Lagrangian\nLI = K1\u03d5+K2\u03d5 = \u2212HI ,\nwhere \u03d5 denotes a scalar field of mass m and standard propagator (3.2), while K1 and K2 are external sources.

The theory is unitary (it is just a free field theory), so C = I \u2261 \u2211 n |n\u3009\u3008n|. More-\nover, \u2211 n\u30080|\u03d5(x)|n\u3009\u3008n|\u03d5(y)|0\u3009 = \u30080|\u03d5(x)\u03d5(y)|0\u3009. In a product such as V CV , the Wick contraction between a \u03d5 due to the left V and a \u03d5 due to the right V is just a product of field operators, with no time ordering, which gives the cut propagator (3.5), with energy conventionally flowing from the right to the left. Now, choose A = |0\u3009\u30080|, so B = I\u2212|0\u3009\u30080|. Let us assume, for the moment, that the \u2126 correction vanishes. Then, the amplitude V\u2126 is given by (2.10):\nV0 = ( 1 + 12V B )\u22121 V = V \u2212 12V BV + 1 4V BV BV +O(V 4). (4.1)\nWe can understand the meaning of this expression by concentrating on the first correction, \u2212VBV/2. Differentiating (4.1) with respect to iK1 and iK2, and setting the sources to zero afterward, we obtain\n\u03b42V0 i\u03b4K1(x)i\u03b4K2(y) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 K=0 = \u03b4 2V i\u03b4K1(x)i\u03b4K2(y) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 K=0\n\u221212\n[ \u03b4V\ni\u03b4K1(x) B\n\u03b4V i\u03b4K2(y) + \u03b4V i\u03b4K2(y) B \u03b4V i\u03b4K1(x) ] K=0 .\nAveraging on the vacuum state, we find\n\u30080|T \u03d5(x)\u03d5(y)|0\u30090 \u2212 1 2\u30080|\u03d5(x)\u03d5(y)|0\u30090 \u2212 1 2\u30080|\u03d5(y)\u03d5(x)|0\u30090,\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\nthat is to say, after Fourier transform,\ni p2 \u2212m2 + i \u2212 1 2(2\u03c0)\u03b8(p 0)\u03b4(p2 \u2212m2)\u2212 12(2\u03c0)\u03b8(\u2212p 0)\u03b4(p2 \u2212m2) = P i p2 \u2212m2 , (4.2)\nwhere P denotes the Cauchy principal value. The projected free propagator is just the principal value, which contains no on-shell part. This is precisely the free propagator of a purely virtual particle [7]. Thus, the correction to V subtracts the on-shell part of the Feynman propagator, and renders the particle described by \u03d5 purely virtual. In passing, we recall that the propagator (4.2) cannot be used as such inside loop diagrams: not surprisingly, a non time-ordered product must be worked out on a diagram by diagram basis. Thus, the result (4.2) is not sufficient to claim that we are dealing with purely virtual articles: it is just the first hint."

            "text": "Now we consider a tree diagram made of two adjacent propagators, which we denote by means of the symbol \u2227. We take the interaction Lagrangian\nLI = K1\u03d51 +K12\u03d51\u03d52 +K2\u03d52 = \u2212HI ,\nwhere \u03d5j denote scalar fields with diagonalized kinetic terms, masses mj and standard propagators\niFj \u2261 i\np2 \u2212m2j + i ,\nKi and K12 being external sources. For the moment, we consider the case where we project both \u03d51 and \u03d52 away. Then we have, again, C = I = \u2211 n |n\u3009\u3008n|, A = |0\u3009\u30080|, B = I\u2212|0\u3009\u30080|. If we differentiate V\u2126, (4.1) and identities like (2.3) and (2.8) once with respect to iK1(x1), iK2(x2) and iK12(x), and set the sources to zero afterward, we can study the correlation function \u30080|T \u03d51(x1)\u03d51(x)\u03d52(x)\u03d52(x2)|0\u3009 and its projection. We start again from \u2126 = 0. Denote the matrix B by means of a vertical bar, standing for a cut across which the energy conventionally flows from the right to the left. We can drop O(V 4) in formula (4.1), because it does not contribute here. We remain with diagrams that have two, one and zero cuts. We have to distribute the vertices of LI in between the vertical bars, as well as to the left and to the right of them, in all possible ways. We must also include the exchanges of \u03d51 and \u03d52, and pay attention to the fact that each zone should contain at least one vertex. The diagrams we obtain are shown in figure 1. It is understood that the vertices are equal to unity. What is the meaning of a leg that is cut twice? Nothing particular, just the propagation of a free particle in the stripe between two cuts. We have seen above that a cut is a missing time ordering: when a field to the left of a cut is contracted with a field to the right of the cut, we have the non time-ordered propagator (3.5). It follows that two cuts on the same line are the same as one cut.\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\nCollecting the various contributions, we obtain\nV0(\u2227,PV2) = (iP1)(iP2)\u2212\u2206+1 \u2206 \u2212 2 \u2212\u2206 \u2212 1 \u2206 + 2 , (4.3)\nwhere the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the legs \u03d51 and \u03d52. We have defined\nPi = P 1\np2i \u2212m2i , \u2206\u00b1i = \u03c0\u03b8(\u00b1p 0 i )\u03b4(p2i \u2212m2i ),\nwhere p\u00b5i = (p0i ,pi) is the momentum of the ith leg, flowing from the right to the left with respect to the ordering x1-x-x2, and \u03c9i = \u221a p2i +m2i is the ith frequency. Here and below, we use the notations V0 and V\u2126 with a different meaning with respect to before. Specifically, they stand for the derivatives of the matrices V0 and V\u2126 of (2.10) and (2.16) with respect to the sources K. Their arguments are the type of diagram we are considering (here \u2227) and the types of particles propagating inside. We see that the result (4.3) is not the product (iP1)(iP2) of the projected propagators of the two legs. This means two things: that the projection of a product diagram is not the product of the projected factors; that we do not get the result predicted by the diagrammatics of purely virtual particles, as per [7]. Both these issues can be solved by advocating a nonvanishing matrix \u2126, as allowed by formula (2.16). For our purposes, that formula can be truncated to\nV\u2126 \u2192 V \u2212 1 2V CV + 1 4V CV CV + \u2126.\nBesides dropping O(V 4), which cannot contribute here, we have also dropped the terms containing A = |0\u3009\u30080|. Indeed, any diagram with an A cut is disconnected, because it contains some V |0\u3009\u30080|V , while the diagram we are considering is connected (and so are its cut versions).\nIf we set \u03b43\u2126\ni\u03b4K1i\u03b4K2i\u03b4K12 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 K=0 = \u2206+1 \u2206 \u2212 2 + \u2206 \u2212 1 \u2206 + 2 , (4.4)\nwe cancel the last two terms of (4.3) and obtain the desired result\nV\u2126(\u2227,PV2) = (iP1)(iP2). (4.5)\nThe correction (4.4) is indeed generated by an anti-Hermitian contribution to the matrix \u2126.\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\n. . .\n. . . . . .\nFigure 2. Examples of tree diagrams with three propagators.\nFormula (4.5) is what we wanted: the result factorizes and coincides with the one predicted by having purely virtual particles on the internal legs. We thus learn that a possible role of \u2126 is to convert the result to a better diagrammatic form, since the matrix formula (2.16) is not constrained to have a satisfactory one. Assume now that one particle, say particle 1, is physical and the second particle needs to be quantized as purely virtual. Recall that the matrix A projects onto the physical subspace, made by the states built with \u03d51, while B projects onto the complementary subspace. We must reinstate all the contributions of the diagrams of figure 1, where the left side, or the right side, of any B cut are physical. This happens: i) when they contain no fields \u03d52, and ii) when they contain two fields \u03d52 (which are going to disappear after Wick contraction). Specifically, we must restore the 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th and 8th diagram, plus the one obtained from the 8th by exchanging the legs 1 and 2. The sum of these diagrams is\n\u2212(iF2)(\u2206+1 + \u2206 \u2212 1 ) + (\u2206 + 1 + \u2206 \u2212 1 )(\u2206 + 2 + \u2206 \u2212 2 ) = \u2212(iP2)(\u2206 + 1 + \u2206 \u2212 1 ).\nSubtracting from (4.3), we obtain\nV0(\u2227,Ph-PV) = (iF1)(iP2)\u2212\u2206+1 \u2206 \u2212 2 \u2212\u2206 \u2212 1 \u2206 + 2 , (4.6)\nat \u2126 = 0. Again, the result is not the one dictated by a theory of physical and purely virtual particles. However, it becomes the desired one, as soon as we choose the same \u2126 as in (4.4), which subtracts the last two terms. We finally obtain the factorized result\nV\u2126(\u2227,Ph-PV) = (iF1)(iP2).

            "text": "Now we study two tree diagrams with three propagators. We have contributions from cut diagrams that contain up to three cuts, shown in figure 2. In the first example, which we denote by \u22a5, the three lines meet at the same point, so we take\nLI = K1\u03d51 +K2\u03d52 +K3\u03d53 +K123\u03d51\u03d52\u03d53,\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\ndifferentiate once with respect to each source (times i) and then set the sources to zero. It is easy to show that, if A = |0\u3009\u30080|, B = I\u2212|0\u3009\u30080|, and \u2126 is chosen to be zero, formula (2.10) for V0 gives\nV0 (\u22a5,PV3) = (iP1)(iP2)(iP3)\u2212 [(iP1)(\u2206+2 \u2206+3 + \u2206\u22122 \u2206\u22123 ) + cyclic permutations] , (4.8)\nwhere the energy flows are oriented towards the common vertex. The terms in between the square brackets are then subtracted by means of \u2126. The reduced amplitude V\u2126 finally gives the non-amputated vertex of three purely virtual particles,\nV\u2126 (\u22a5,PV3) = (iP1)(iP2)(iP3), (4.9)\nas desired. An interesting configuration is the one where one leg, say \u03d53, is physical, while the other two need to be quantized as purely virtual. At \u2126 = 0 we must discard the diagrams of (2.16) where a B cut crosses only the physical leg \u03d53. We obtain\n(iP1)(iP2)(iF3)\u2212 [ (iP1)(\u2206+2 \u2206 + 3 + \u2206 \u2212 2 \u2206 \u2212 3 ) + cyclic permutations ] \u2212(\u2206+1 \u2206 + 2 + \u2206 \u2212 1 \u2206 \u2212 2 )(\u2206 + 3 + \u2206 \u2212 3 ). (4.10)\nThe first term is the result we expect. The middle term can be subtracted away by means of an overall anti-Hermitian \u2126 correction for the diagram. However, the last term cannot be adjusted that way, which would require a non anti-Hermitian correction. Luckily, it disappears by itself, as we show right away. The point is that at \u2126 = 0 we miss the whole second line of formula (2.16). So doing, we ignore not only the overall \u2126 corrections to the diagram, we can be adjusted when needed, but also the \u2126 corrections inherited from the subdiagrams, which cannot be neglected, nor modified. Expanding the right-hand side in powers of V , formula (2.16) truncates to\nV\u2126 = V \u2212 1 2V BV + 1 4V BV BV \u2212 1 8V BV BV BV + \u2126 + 1 2\u2126AV + 1 2V A\u2126. (4.11)\nThe third to last term, \u2126, can be used to adjust the middle term of (4.10): this is the overall \u2126 correction to the diagram. The last two terms are the crucial ones, because they are inherited from the subdiagrams. Now we show that they remove the difficulty mentioned above. Specifically, we have to use the \u2126 of formula (4.4) for the subdiagrams made by the two adjacent legs \u03d51 and \u03d52. The last two contributions to (4.11) are shown to the left in figure 3, where the double line denotes the A cut. Since A is the projector onto the physical subspace Wph, the A cut can only cross physical legs, in our case just \u03d53. Noting that the conventions for the orientations of the energy flows turn (4.4) into \u2206+1 \u2206 + 2 + \u2206 \u2212 1 \u2206 \u2212 2 , the last two contribution to (4.11) are\n(\u2206+1 \u2206 + 2 + \u2206 \u2212 1 \u2206 \u2212 2 )\u2206 \u00b1 3 .\nOnce we include them, as per formula (4.11), we find the expected, factorized result, which is\nV\u2126 (\u22a5,PV2-Ph) = (iP1)(iP2)(iF3),\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\nagain in agreement with what predicted by the diagrammatics of the theories of physical and purely virtual particles. Now we consider the case where \u03d52 and \u03d53 are both physical, and only \u03d51 needs to be purely virtual. At \u2126 = 0 we must drop the diagrams containing a cut that does not cross the leg \u03d51. Again, the last two terms of (4.11) tell us that we have to include the \u2126 corrections for the subdiagrams. The interested subdiagrams are two: the one made by the legs \u03d51 and \u03d52, plus the one made by the legs \u03d51 and \u03d53. Note that there is no \u2126 correction for the subdiagram made by the legs \u03d52 and \u03d53, because A cannot cut the leg \u03d51. We also have to include an overall \u2126 correction, corresponding to the third to last term of (4.11), to subtract the anti-Hermitian contributions\n\u2212 [ (iP2)(\u2206+1 \u2206 + 3 + \u2206 \u2212 1 \u2206 \u2212 3 ) + (iP3)(\u2206 + 1 \u2206 + 2 + \u2206 \u2212 1 \u2206 \u2212 2 ) ] .\nAt the end, we find the desired, factorized result\nV\u2126 (\u22a5,PV-Ph2) = (iP1)(iF2)(iF3).\nThe second example of tree diagram with three legs is the one where the propagators are adjacent, shown to the right of figure 2. We take\nLI = K1\u03d51 +K12\u03d51\u03d52 +K23\u03d52\u03d53 +K3\u03d53.\nIf all the legs are to be quantized as purely virtual, formula (2.16) gives\n(iP1)(iP2)(iP3)\u2212 [ (iP1)(\u2206+2 \u2206 \u2212 3 + \u2206 \u2212 2 \u2206 + 3 ) + cyclic permutations ] (4.12)\nat \u2126 = 0, the energy flows being ordered according to the sequence x1-x2-x3. Again, the terms between the square brackets, which violate the factorization rule, can be subtracted away by means of an overall \u2126 correction. No \u2126 corrections due to subdiagrams contribute, since there is no physical leg that can be cut by A (which is just |0\u3009\u30080|). If the third leg is physical, the other two being purely virtual, the right result, which is (iP1)(iP2)(iF3), is obtained by including, again, the overall \u2126 corrections that subtracts the terms in square brackets of (4.12), plus the \u2126 corrections due to the subdiagram made by the two adjacent legs \u03d51 and \u03d52. Here the convention for the energy flow orientations is the same as in (4.4). If the middle leg is physical and the other two are purely virtual, we obtain the desired result, which is (iP1)(iF2)(iP3), with the same overall \u2126 correction as for (4.12). No \u2126\n\u2013 17 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\ncorrections for subdiagrams contribute, because the subdiagrams obtained by cutting the physical leg are just simple propagators. If the physical legs are at the sides and the middle leg is purely virtual, we obtain the factorized result (iF1)(iP2)(iF3) after including: i) the \u2126 corrections for the two subdiagrams made by a physical leg and a purely virtual one, and ii) the overall \u2126 correction, which now reads [\n(iP1)(\u2206+2 \u2206 \u2212 3 + \u2206 \u2212 2 \u2206 + 3 ) + (iP3)(\u2206 + 1 \u2206 \u2212 2 + \u2206 \u2212 1 \u2206 + 2 ) ] , (4.13)\ninstead of the square bracket of (4.12). An interesting case is when the legs \u03d51 and \u03d52 are physical and the leg \u03d53 is purely virtual. We obtain\n(iF1)(iF2)(iP3)\u2212 (\u2206+1 + \u2206 \u2212 1 )(\u2206 + 2 \u2206 \u2212 3 + \u2206 \u2212 2 \u2206 + 3 )\u2212 (\u2206 + 3 + \u2206 \u2212 3 )(\u2206 + 1 \u2206 \u2212 2 + \u2206 \u2212 1 \u2206 + 2 ) \u2212 [ (iP1)(\u2206+2 \u2206 \u2212 3 + \u2206 \u2212 2 \u2206 + 3 ) + (iP2)(\u2206 + 1 \u2206 \u2212 3 + \u2206 \u2212 1 \u2206 + 3 ) ] (4.14)\nat \u2126 = 0. The first contribution, (iF1)(iF2)(iP3), is the expected, factorized result. We obtain it after including the right \u2126 corrections as follows. The second line of (4.14) is subtracted by means of a new, overall \u2126 correction. The middle terms of the first line are subtracted by the \u2126 corrections of formula (4.4), due to the subdiagram made by the legs \u03d52 and \u03d53. The right terms of the first line are subtracted in a new, probably unexpected way: they are canceled by the \u2126 corrections, derived in formula (5.3) below, associated with the disconnected subdiagrams made by the leg \u03d53 and the endpoint of the leg \u03d51. These corrections, illustrated in the last two diagrams of figure 3, read\n1 2V A\u2126\u2192 1 2 ( 2\u2206\u22121 2\u2206 + 2 ) \u2206+3 + \u2206\u22123 2 ,\n1 2\u2126AV \u2192 1 2 \u2206+3 + \u2206 \u2212 3 2 ( 2\u2206+1 2\u2206 \u2212 2 ) .\nThe arrows stand for dropping the source factors iK. We see that only when we take care of everything properly, we obtain the desired, factorized result, and find agreement with the diagrammatics of a theory of physical and purely virtual particles. What is important is that we can always determine the needed \u2126 corrections, and that they are unique."

The reason why we find zero, instead of \u03bb1\u03bb2 is that, by taking A = 0, we have subtracted too much, including the contributions of the vacuum state. If we take A = |0\u3009\u30080|, we have nothing to subtract (B = 0), so the result of formula (2.16) for V\u2126 at \u2126 = 0 is just \u03bb1\u03bb2, i.e., the product of the two vertices.\nLet us now consider the product of a propagator and a constant vertex. We start from\nLI = K1\u03d51 +K2\u03d51 +K3.\nFormula (2.16) gives, at A = \u2126 = 0,\n\u221212(\u2206 + 1 + \u2206 \u2212 1 ),\nwhich can be subtracted away by an appropriate \u2126 correction. Then, the final result is zero, but, again, we have subtracted too much. The physical space Wph cannot be empty: it must contain at least the vacuum state |0\u3009. If we want to quantize \u03d51 as a purely virtual particle, we must take A = |0\u3009\u30080|. Then (2.10) gives\niP1 \u2212 1 2(\u2206 + 1 + \u2206 \u2212 1 ). (5.2)\nThe expected result for a purely virtual particle is not this, but just iP1. We obtain iP1 by means of the \u2126 subtraction\n\u03b43\u2126 i\u03b4K1i\u03b4K2i\u03b4K3 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 K=0 = 12(\u2206 + 1 + \u2206 \u2212 1 ). (5.3)\nWe see that the \u2126 corrections are crucial and generically nontrivial, even in an arrangement as simple as the product of a propagator times a constant. The product of a purely virtual propagator and two constant vertices can be studied by taking\nLI = K1\u03d51 +K2\u03d51 +K3 +K4.\nThen (2.10), or (2.16), give iP1 \u2212\u2206+1 \u2212\u2206 \u2212 1\nfor A = |0\u3009\u30080| at \u2126 = 0. The bad news is that we cannot subtract the last two terms of this expression by means of an anti-Hermitian \u2126 for the overall diagram. The good news is that there is no need to, because they disappear by themselves once we include the \u2126 corrections (5.3) due to the disconnected subdiagrams made by a propagator and a single\n\u2013 19 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\nvertex, as required by the last two terms of (4.11). At the end, the result is just iP1, as desired.\nThe disconnected product of two purely virtual propagators is studied from\nLI = K1\u03d51 +K \u20321\u03d51 +K2\u03d52 +K \u20322\u03d52,\nby differentiating with respect to each iK once, and then setting the sources to zero. If we apply formula (2.16) with A = |0\u3009\u30080|, \u2126 = 0, we find\nV0(| |,PV2) = iP1iP2 \u2212 1 2 [ iP1 ( \u2206+2 + \u2206 \u2212 2 ) + iP2 ( \u2206+1 + \u2206 \u2212 1 )] . (5.4)\nWe obtain the expected result, V\u2126(| |,PV2) = iP1iP2, once we remove the terms in square brackets by means of an overall \u2126 correction.\nIf the leg \u03d51 is purely virtual and the leg \u03d52 is physical, formula (2.10) gives\nV0(| |,PV-Ph) = iP1iF2 \u2212 ( \u2206+1 + \u2206 \u2212 1 ) ( \u2206+2 + \u2206 \u2212 2 ) \u2212 12 [ iP2 ( \u2206+1 + \u2206 \u2212 1 )] . (5.5)\nThe middle term is subtracted by including the \u2126 correction (5.3) associated with the disconnected subdiagrams made by the \u03d51 propagator and any endpoint of the \u03d52 propagator. The last term is subtracted by the overall \u2126 correction. At the end, we find the expected, factorized result V\u2126(| |,PV-Ph) = iP1iF2. We have learned that the projections of the tree diagrams and those of the disconnected diagrams are not as straightforward as we might have hoped. Yet, they always give the expected, factorized results once we choose the \u2126 corrections appropriately. The examples we have studied suggest that the right \u2126 is determined uniquely by this requirement."

            "text": "In this section and the next one we study loop diagrams. We use the conventions of [7]. Specifically, we integrate on the loop energies k0, with measure dk0/(2\u03c0), and ignore the integrals on the space components k of the loop momenta. The reason is that the identities we write hold for arbitrary values of the frequencies \u03c9 of the internal and external legs of the diagrams. Moreover, we conventionally multiply every propagator by a factor 2\u03c9. So doing, we obtain the so-called \u201cskeleton diagrams\u201d, which allow us to study unitarity by means of simple algebraic operations. Every internal leg is labeled by an index a, b, . . .. The a-th leg has mass ma and carries momentum k\u00b5 \u2212 p\u00b5a , where k\u00b5 = (k0,k) denotes the loop momentum and p\u00b5a = (ea,pa) is an external momentum. The frequency of the a-th leg is \u03c9a = \u221a m2a + (k\u2212 pa)2. In the notation we are adopting, each internal leg has its own external momentum pa. So doing, the external momenta are redundant, but make the formulas more symmetric and easier to handle. After multiplying by 2\u03c9, the Feynman propagator P , its conjugate P \u2217 and the cut propagators P\u00b1 become\nP = i e\u2212 \u03c9 + i \u2212\ni e+ \u03c9 \u2212 i , P \u2217 = i e+ \u03c9 + i \u2212 i e\u2212 \u03c9 \u2212 i , P\u00b1 = (2\u03c0)\u03b4(e\u2213\u03c9).

(6.2)\nWe have a different overall factor with respect to [7], since we assume that the vertices are equal to one (while in [7] they are equal to \u2212i).\nFor future use, we define\n\u2206ab = \u03c0\u03b4(ea \u2212 eb \u2212 \u03c9a \u2212 \u03c9b), Pab = P 1\nea \u2212 eb \u2212 \u03c9a \u2212 \u03c9b ,\nQab = Pab \u2212 P 1 ea \u2212 eb \u2212 \u03c9a + \u03c9b , P\u0302ab = Pab + Pba.\nIn particular, Pab and \u2206ab are the basic ingredients of the \u201cthreshold decomposition\u201d of a skeleton diagram Gs, which organizes the contributions to Gs according to the number of delta functions, which are on shell. This number is called level of the decomposition. We recall that, starting from the threshold decomposition of a Feynman diagram, the threshold decomposition of a diagram with purely virtual particles f is obtained by suppressing the delta functions whose arguments contain any frequency \u03c9f of such particles [7]. In all the examples we consider, C = I, A is the projector \u03a0ph onto the physical space Wph, and B = I\u2212\u03a0ph is the projector onto the complement Wpv. We study the case where all the internal legs are quantized as purely virtual particles (A = |0\u3009\u30080|), as well as the cases where some internal legs are physical and the others are purely virtual."

As before, the projection (6.5) of the product does not coincide with the product (iP\u030212)(iP\u030234) of the projected factors, at \u2126 = 0.

The other diagrams are obtained from (6.9) by means of permutations, or by flipping the signs of the energies. If one internal leg is physical and the other two have to be quantized as purely virtual, the result is the same, because all the diagrams of figure 4 still contribute. Instead, if two internal legs (\u03d52 and \u03d53) are physical and the other one is purely virtual, we must drop the diagrams that have no field \u03d51, or two fields \u03d51, to the left or right of a B cut, as explained in section 3.

This happens when an internal leg is replaced by a stack of legs with the same endpoints, as shown to the left of figure 6. At the level of skeleton diagrams, we have the identity\nSsn = Ss1 ( n\u2211 i=1 ei, n\u2211 i=1 \u03c9i ) , (7.1)\nwhere Ssn denotes the skeleton of the diagram made by the stack of n propagators, Ss1 is a single propagator, ei are the external energies of the various legs, oriented from right to left, and \u03c9i are frequencies of the legs. The identity (7.1) holds for \u201cFeynman stacks\u201d, as well as \u201cnon time-ordered stacks\u201d. The former are made by n Feynman propagators, in which case Ss1 is a single Feynman propagator P of (6.1). The latter are made by n cut propagators, in which case Ss1 is a single cut propagator P+ of (6.1). If the stack Ssn contains one or more purely virtual legs, while the other legs are Feynman propagators, no overall \u2126 correction is required, as well as no \u2126 corrections for subdiagrams. Combining the facts just stated, the reduction V \u2192 V0 of formula (2.10) shows that the projection of the stack Ssn is just the propagator\nP (\ni\u2211n i=1(ei \u2212 \u03c9i) \u2212 i\u2211n i=1(ei + \u03c9i)\n) (7.2)\nof a single purely virtual particle with energy equal to the total incoming energy and frequency equal to the total frequency.

Let us assume that the first and fourth legs have the same endpoints, and their energies e1 and e4 have the same orientations. Then, we easily retrieve the formulas of subsection 6.2 with e1 \u2192 e1 + e4, \u03c91 \u2192 \u03c91 + \u03c94. The same works for the box with pseudodiagonal, where the endpoints of the fifth leg coincide with those of one of the first four legs. And the same works for diagrams with arbitrarily many loops: when the internal legs can be grouped together into stacks, the results coincide with those of a diagram with fewer loops, obtained by replacing each stack with a single leg, with energy equal to the total energy flowing into the stack, and frequency equal to the total frequency. An example is shown in the middle of figure 6, which is a diagram equivalent to the hexagon. These properties hold for the Feynman diagrams, as well as for the diagrams of the reduced scattering matrices derived in section 2. The first nontrivial arrangement at two loops is the box with (true) diagonal, shown to the right of figure 6. The arrows are opposite to the orientations of the external energies ei. From [7], the threshold decomposition reads\nGs4D = \u2212iP4D + \u220612G\u0303sPV3|345 + \u2206 21G\u0303sPV3|345 + \u2206 45G\u0303sPV3|123 + \u2206 54G\u0303sPV3|123\n+ i2 \u2211 s4D (Qa3c \u2212 2i\u2206a3c)\u2206ab\u2206cd + i \u2211 s4D \u2206a3c [ iQab(Qcd \u2212 i\u2206cd) + \u2206abQcd ] + i2 \u2211 s4D \u2206a3c [ \u2206a3d(Qab \u2212 i\u2206ab) + \u2206b3c(Qcd \u2212 i\u2206cd) ] , (7.3)\nwhere P4D = \u2211 s4D Pa3c [ PabPcd + 12P abPa3d + 12P b3cPcd + 12P a3dPb3c ] ,\nand \u2206abG\u0303sPV3|cdf = \u2206 ab GsPV3|cdf \u2223\u2223\u2223 e3\u2192e3\u2212eb\u2212\u03c9b\n, GsPV3|abc being the skeleton (6.8) of the purely virtual triangle with legs abc. Moreover, Pa3c, Qa3c and \u2206a3c are the same as Pa3, Qa3 and \u2206a3, respectively, with ea \u2192 ea+ec and \u03c9a \u2192 \u03c9a+\u03c9c. The sums \u2211 s4D are over the permutations a, b of 1, 2, the permutations c, d of 4, 5, plus (e\u2192 \u2212e). We start from the case where every internal leg is quantized as purely virtual. If we apply formula (2.16) with \u2126 = 0, we find\n\u2212 iP4D \u2212 i [ \u220621\u220654Q235 + (e\u2192 \u2212e) ] (7.4)\nwhich is the expected result, \u2212iP4D, plus a term that can be canceled by means of an overall anti-Hermitian \u2126 correction. In the end, we obtain\nGs4D ( PV5 ) = \u2212iP4D, (7.5)\nas desired. The reason why it is necessary to include the correction just mentioned is easily explained. Although Gs4D is a prime diagram, it factorizes when we \u201ccontract\u201d the diagonal. The contraction operation, denoted by C3, is studied in detail in section 8. It amounts to multiplying the skeleton diagram by im3/2 and taking the limit m3 \u2192\u221e.\n\u2013 26 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\nDiagrammatically, the result of the contraction is a purely virtual double bubble, which is obviously not prime. We know from section 6 that such a diagram needs the \u2126 correction (6.6). A consistency check is to multiply the square bracket of (7.4) by im3/2, take the limit m3 \u2192\u221e, and verify that what we obtain is indeed canceled by the analogue of (6.6). Now we consider the physical box with a purely virtual diagonal, i.e., the case where the diagonal is the only purely virtual leg. This time, the contraction C3 gives the physical double bubble, which does not need any \u2126 correction. Indeed, formula (2.16) at \u2126 = 0 correctly gives\nGs4D ( Ph2-PV-Ph2 ) = Gs4D|3 ,\nwhere Gs4D|a,b,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 means the expression (7.3) upon suppression of all the terms where any frequency \u03c9a, \u03c9b, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 appears in the argument of some delta function. No \u2126 corrections for subdiagrams are involved, since the subdiagrams in question are triangles. When the legs 1 and 3 are purely virtual, while all the other ones are physical, the contraction C3 gives, again, the purely virtual double bubble, so the same \u2126 correction as for (7.4) must be included. The reduced amplitude V\u2126 gives\nGs4D ( PV-Ph-PV-Ph2 ) = Gs4D|1,3 ,\nin agreement with [7]. An interesting case is the one where two adjacent non diagonal legs, say 2 and 5, are purely virtual, while the others are physical. We find the same overall \u2126 correction as above, because C3 gives the purely virtual double bubble. However, we also find some unwanted terms that cannot be subtracted by means of an overall, anti-Hermitian \u2126. Luckily, they cancel out automatically, as in the other cases analyzed so far, once we include the \u2126 corrections due to the subdiagrams, as per the last two terms \u2126AV/2 and V A\u2126/2 of formula (4.11). The unwanted terms are subtracted away by the diagrams where the three physical legs, which are 1, 3 and 4, are crossed by the A cut. One side of the cut contains the vertex \u03d51\u03d53\u03d54, while the other side contains the \u2126 corrections (4.4) to the subdiagram made by the legs 2 and 5. At the end, we correctly find\nGs4D ( Ph-PV-Ph2-PV ) = Gs4D|2,5 ,\nThe other cases can be treated similarly."

(8.3)\nWe denote the operation (8.1), applied to the internal leg `, by I`, or Ie` . It is a useful tool to inspect the diagrams and, for example, check whether they are purely virtual or not, and quantify their virtual contents versus their on-shell contents. It is also useful, as we show in the next section, to ascend and descend among the diagrams.\nIf we prefer to use the standard notation (3.3), (3.5), then the operation I` is\nIe(G\u0304s) \u2261 2\u03c9 \u222b +\u221e \u2212\u221e de 2\u03c0 G\u0304 s(e),\nwhere G\u0304s denotes the skeleton diagram with propagators (3.3), (3.5). We can apply I` to one or more internal legs of a diagram Gs. We begin by studying what happens when we integrate on all the independent external energies ei. Taking into account that, by definition, we are already integrating on all the internal energies of a skeleton diagram, we end up integrating on all the independent energies of the diagram. So doing, all the Feynman propagators collapse to unity. The result of this operation is called avirtuality of the skeleton diagram Gs and measures its \u201con-shellness\u201d. If Gs is the skeleton of an ordinary Feynman diagram with v (nonderivative) vertices, its avirtuality is equal to one.1 The purely virtual contents of the one-loop prime diagrams considered so far were singled out by reduced amplitude V\u030a of formula (2.17). Denote the skeleton diagrams associated with V\u030a by G\u030as. We show that the avirtuality of an arbitrary G\u030as with v vertices is\nAv = 1 + v\u22121\u2211 k=1 (\u22121)k 2k ak+1,v, (8.4)\n1We recall that we are working in the notation where each nonderivative vertex is equal to 1. In the usual notation, where a vertex is equal to \u2212i\u03bb, \u03bb denoting some coupling, we would have (\u2212i\u03bb)v. Diagrams with derivative vertices can be reduced to sums of diagrams with nonderivative vertices, as explained in [7].\n\u2013 28 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\nwhere ak+1,v is defined by the recursive relation\nan,v = nv \u2212 n\u22121\u2211 k=1\n( n\nk\n) ak,v, a1,v = 1. (8.5)\nFormula (8.4) is proved as follows. Expand the right-hand side of equation (2.17) in powers of v. The nth power contains n\u2212 1 vertical cuts, and each cut is equal to\n\u221212(C \u2212 |0\u3009\u30080|).\nThe cuts identify n \u2212 2 vertical strips. Two half planes lie at the sides, their boundaries being the first and the last cuts. We consider them as further strips. The v vertices of G\u030as must be distributed inside the n strips in all possible ways. If we include the possibility to leave some strips empty, there are nV ways of doing so. However, such a possibility must be excluded. Let an,v denote the number of distributions where such a possibility is indeed excluded. Clearly, an,v is equal to nv minus the distributions that contain empty strips. Such distributions can be distinguished according to the number k of empty strips, which ranges from 1 to n \u2212 1. There are (n k ) ways of choosing the k empty strips. In each case, the v vertices can be distributed in an\u2212k,v ways. This gives the recurrence relation (8.5). Each arrangement gives a contribution equal to unity, once the operation (8.1) is applied to all the independent external energies. Expanding (2.17), we thus find formula (8.4). We see that the avirtuality of a diagram depends only on the number of vertices, not on the type of diagram G\u030as. We can easily check that Av vanishes for every even v. The avirtualities of the first odd values of v are\nA1 = 1, A3 = \u2212 1 2 , A5 = 1, A7 = \u2212 17 4 , A9 = 31, A11 = \u2212 691 2 .\nLet us apply formula (8.4) to the examples of the previous sections. The simplest case is the avirtuality of the purely virtual propagator (4.2), which we know to be zero by formula (8.3). This is the case v = 2.\nTriangle. Now we check that the avirtuality of the triangle of purely virtual particles is indeed A3 = \u22121/2, using formula (6.8). To this purpose, we need the identity (B.1), proved in appendix B. We have to calculate\nIe1Ie2 G s 3 ( PV3 ) = \u2212 \u222b +\u221e \u2212\u221e de1 2\u03c0 \u222b +\u221e \u2212\u221e de2 2\u03c0 [ P12P13 + cycl + (e\u2192 \u2212e) ] .\nParticular attention has to be paid to the convergence of the integrals at infinity. Ignoring the integral over e1 for a moment, we find\n\u2212 \u222b +\u221e \u2212\u221e de2 2\u03c0 (P 23P21+P32P12)\u2212 \u222b +\u221e \u2212\u221e de2 2\u03c0 (P 12+P23)P13\u2212 \u222b +\u221e \u2212\u221e de2 2\u03c0 (P 21+P32)P31. (8.6)\nThe last two integrals of this list are convergent for e2 \u2192 \u00b1\u221e, and give zero. The first integral can be worked out by means of (B.1) and gives\nIe2 G s 3 ( PV3 ) = \u2212\u03c02 [\u03b4(e1 \u2212 e3 \u2212 \u03c91 + \u03c93) + \u03b4(e1 \u2212 e3 + \u03c91 \u2212 \u03c93)]. (8.7)\nAt this point, the operation Ie1 gives \u22121/2, as we wanted to show.\n\u2013 29 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\nOne may wonder if we can add \u2126 corrections to obtain zero, instead. If not, we must infer that (8.7) and A3 = \u22121/2 are intrinsic to the diagram. We recall that \u2126 cannot change the level 0 of the threshold decomposition, which matches the Euclidean diagram. It cannot change the odd levels of the decomposition either, because they are not anti-Hermitian. So, the first level that can be affected by \u2126 is the second one. There are two possibilities to remove (8.7) by means of \u2126. One is to add something containing \u220612\u220632, plus (e \u2192 \u2212e), because the operation Ie2 on it can compensate (8.7). However, the symmetries under the permutations of the internal legs, and (e\u2192 \u2212e), imply that we would have to add the whole sum\n\u220612\u220632 + cycl + (e\u2192 \u2212e).\nThe operation Ie2 on the additional terms gives contributions proportional to \u220613, which must not be there.\nThe second possibility is to add\n\u03c02[\u03b4(e1 \u2212 e3 \u2212 \u03c91 + \u03c93)\u03b4(e1 \u2212 e2 \u2212 \u03c91 + \u03c92) + \u03b4(e1 \u2212 e3 + \u03c91 \u2212 \u03c93)\u03b4(e1 \u2212 e2 + \u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92)].\nThis is not acceptable either, since the double singularities due to these delta functions are not present in the starting triangle diagram. A quick way to see this is by noting that differences of frequencies appear, which cannot be traded for sums of frequencies. By stability, it must be possible to express all the singularities of a skeleton diagram defined by means of the Feynman i prescription in terms of sums of frequencies (see [7] for details). We conclude that the avirtuality A3 = \u22121/2 is an intrinsic property of the purely virtual triangle diagram.\nBox. The avirtuality A4 of the box diagram with circulating purely virtual particles is equal to zero. We can verify this result as before, from formulas (6.12) and (6.13), using the identities (B.1) and (B.5) of appendix B. We apply Ie3Ie2Ie1 to (6.13): we first integrate on e1, then on e2 and finally on e3. We can distinguish terms PabPcdPef with three, two and one indices equal to 1. The e1 integral gives zero on the terms that just have one index 1, since they can be organized into the sums\n\u2212 i2 \u222b +\u221e \u2212\u221e de1 2\u03c0 P abPac ( 2Pa1 + P1b + P1c ) = \u2212 i2 \u222b +\u221e \u2212\u221e de1 2\u03c0 P baPca ( 2P1a + Pb1 + Pc1 ) = 0, where {a, b, c} is any permutation of {2, 3, 4}. These integrals are separately convergent. Each term with two or three indices equal to 1 is separately convergent, and can be calculated by means of (B.1) and (B.5). After the operation Ie2 , the result is\nIe2Ie1G s 4 ( PV4 ) = \u2212 i2(P 34 + P43).\nWhen we finally apply Ie3 , we get zero, as we wanted to show. Following the same guidelines, we have checked the avirtualities of the purely virtual penthagon and the purely virtual hexagon (formulas (9.1), A5 = 1, A6 = 0), finding agreement with (8.4). The projection V\u030a of the purely virtual box diagram with diagonal gives (7.4), which also satisfies A4 = 0. The inclusion of the \u2126 correction, which leads to (7.5), does not change A4.\n\u2013 30 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8"

The operation, which we denote by C`, where the letter C stands for \u201ccontraction\u201d and the suffix ` denotes the leg that is being contracted, has other interesting virtues. The first one is that it allows us to jump from one diagram to a simpler diagram, in momentum space. Later on we show that it also allows us to jump from simpler diagrams to more complicated diagrams, once it is combined with the integration trick mentioned before. We start from an ordinary Feynman skeleton diagram Gs, and denote the diagram obtained by contracting the leg ` by C`(Gs). For example, if Gs is the box and ` is one of its internal legs, C`(Gs) is the triangle. If Gs is the triangle, C`(Gs) the bubble. If Gs is the bubble, C`(Gs) is the tadpole. If we contract the third leg of the diagram made by three adjacent propagators, we obtain the diagram made by two adjacent propagators. Etc. Note that a connected diagram Gs is mapped into a connected diagram C`(Gs). Instead, a prime diagram Gs can be mapped into a factorized diagram C`(Gs). For example, we have seen that the box with diagonal turns into the double bubble, by contraction of the diagonal leg.\nThe other interesting property of the operation C` is that it applies straightforwardly to the projected skeleton diagrams, the reduced scattering matrices, and every term of the expansion of the right-hand side of formula (2.16), including the \u2126 corrections. Precisely: the contraction C` and the projection V\u2126 commute. To prove this statement, we work on the amplitude V\u2126 of (2.16), starting from \u2126 = 0. Let G\u0302s denote the projection of the Feynman skeleton diagram Gs, C\u0302`(Gs) the projection of the contracted diagram C`(Gs), and C`(G\u0302s) the contraction of the projected diagram G\u0302s. By (8.8), C` sends the cut propagators of the leg ` to zero. This means that every cut diagram contributing to G\u0302s, where the leg ` is crossed by a cut, disappears. Thus, the surviving diagrams of C`(G\u0302s) are precisely the ones of C\u0302`(Gs). We conclude that the projection encoded in the reduced amplitude V\u2126 commutes with the contraction C` at \u2126 = 0: C\u0302`(Gs) = C`(G\u0302s). It then follows that the two operations also commute at nonzero \u2126, if \u2126 is the one that gives a theory of physical and purely virtual particles. The reason is that the diagrammatics of a theory of physical and purely virtual particles, recalled at the beginning of section 6, amounts to a projection that manifestly commutes with the contraction: starting from the threshold decomposition of a Feynman diagram, it suppresses the delta functions whose arguments contain the frequencies \u03c9f of the purely virtual particles f. The contraction C` suppresses the delta functions that contain \u03c9`, via the second limit of (8.8). The order with which we remove the two is clearly immaterial.\n\u2013 31 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\nThese C` properties can be used to relate the \u2126 corrections of bigger skeleton diagrams to the \u2126 corrections of smaller diagrams, and check the results of the previous sections. For example, if we apply C2 to (4.3), we find the purely virtual propagator (4.2), with m \u2192 m1. If we apply C2 to (4.4) we find 0, since the single propagator has no \u2126. If we apply C3 to (4.8), we find (4.3) (with \u2206\u00b12 \u2192 \u2206 \u2213 2 , due to the different conventions for the energy flows). If we apply C3 to the difference between (4.9) and (4.8), we correctly find (4.4) (again with \u2206\u00b12 \u2192 \u2206 \u2213 2 ). If we apply C3 to (4.12) we obtain (4.3) again. If we apply C3 to (4.14), we obtain iF1iF2, as expected. If we apply C2 to (4.14), we correctly obtain (4.6) with 2 \u2192 3. If we apply C2 to (5.4), we find (5.2). If we apply C2 to (5.5), we also find (5.2). If we apply C1 to (5.5), we correctly find the physical propagator iF2. And so on.\nIn loop diagrams we switch to the notation where every propagator is multiplied by 2\u03c9 with respect to the usual definitions. The basic identities are then\nlim m\u2192\u221e\nim 2 i e\u00b1 (\u03c9 \u2212 i ) = \u2213 1 2 , limm\u2192\u221e im 2 P i e\u00b1 \u03c9 = \u221312 , limm\u2192\u221e im 2 (2\u03c0)\u03b4(e\u00b1 \u03c9) = 0.\nIt is easy to check that C4 turns the purely virtual box skeleton (6.13) into the purely virtual triangle skeleton (6.8), and C3 turns (6.8) into the purely virtual bubble skeleton (6.4). Similarly, C4 turns (6.15) into (6.10) with 1\u2194 2, and C4 turns (6.17) into (6.7), etc.\nThe operation C` preserves the threshold decomposition, by which we mean that it maps level i to level i, for each i. For example, the decomposition (6.11) of the box diagram is sent term by term into the decomposition (6.7) of the triangle diagram, by the operation C4. The integration operation I` considered before, instead, mixes different levels (see below)."

The purely virtual triangle can only be proportional to P3, because of the symmetries under the exchanges of the internal legs, and e \u2192 \u2212e. The proportionality constant can be fixed from the purely virtual bubble (6.4), by requiring Gs3 ( PV3\n) C3\u2212\u2192 Gs2(PV2). We then find (6.8). From triangle to box. By the symmetries mentioned above, the purely virtual box can only be a linear combination\n\u2212 a1 i 6 \u2211 perms PabPacPad \u2212 a2 i 4 \u2211 perms PabPacPdb + (e\u2192 \u2212e).

Next, the total should be integrable in every independent external energy. In particular, it should decrease faster than 1/e4 for large e4. Applied to (9.2), this condition gives a2 = a1.

The goal is achieved by first parametrizing the most general decompositions of Gsbig. After that, the arbitrary coefficients are determined by descending to smaller diagrams Gssmall in all possible ways by means of the operations I` and C`. The result is unique.\nWe illustrate this property by studying the chain\nbubble\u2192 triangle\u2192 box\non Feynman skeletons, which means that we assume that all the internal legs are physical. So doing, we cover all the situations obtained by the various projections, with arbitrary combinations of physical and purely virtual internal legs. We have already shown how to ascend through the purely virtual versions of the diagrams, which is equivalent to ascend through the zeroth levels of the threshold decompositions of the Feynman diagrams. The next task is to ascend through the other levels. We do so by writing the most general linear combinations of the allowed terms, built with Pab and \u2206cd according to the rules explained above and satisfying the symmetries given earlier. Then we fix the free constants by descending with the help of the operations I` and C`. The operations C` relate the decompositions level by level, so there is no need to rearrange the decompositions after applying them. Instead, the operations I` mix different levels. This means that, after applying I` to a bigger skeleton Gsbig, the result must be decomposed anew before comparing it to the threshold decomposition of the smaller skeleton Gssmall.\nFrom bubble to triangle. We know that the zeroth level of the threshold decomposition of the triangle skeleton diagram is \u2212P3. We can parametrize the most general nonzero levels as\nlevel 1: i\u03b1 \u2211\nperms \u2206ab(Pac + Pcb),\nlevel 2: \u03b22 \u2211 perms \u2206ab(\u2206ac + \u2206cb).\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are coefficients to be determined.\n\u2013 34 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\nFirst, we require that the contraction C3 gives the bubble diagram (6.3). This implies \u03b1 = 1. Then, we require that the bubble diagram is also obtained by applying the integration I3. This gives \u03b2 = 1. At the end, we obtain the decomposition Gs3 of formula (6.7).\nFrom triangle to box. The zeroth level of the threshold decomposition of the box skeleton diagram was determined from the parametrization (9.2). It coincides with \u2212iP4, given in formula (6.12). Distributing the repeated indices in all possible ways, and using the symmetries mentioned earlier, the most general nonzero levels of the decomposition can be parametrized as\nlevel 1: \u2211\nperms Pab\n[ Pac(\u03b11\u2206ad + \u03b12\u2206db) + (\u03b13Pdb + \u03b14Pdc)\u2206ac ] + (e\u2192 \u2212e),\nlevel 2: \u2211\nperms \u2206ab\n[ \u2206ac(\u03b21Pad + \u03b22Pdb) + (\u03b23\u2206db + \u03b24\u2206dc)Pac ] + (e\u2192 \u2212e),\nlevel 3: \u2211\nperms \u2206ab\u2206ac(\u03b31\u2206ad + \u03b32\u2206db) + (e\u2192 \u2212e).\nwhere \u03b1i, \u03b2i and \u03b3i are the coefficients that must be determined. It is easy to check that \u03b12 and \u03b13, as well as \u03b22 and \u03b23, multiply identical terms, so we can set \u03b13 = \u03b23 = 0. Next, we impose the convergence of the operations I`. This gives \u03b14 = \u03b11 \u2212 (\u03b12/2) and \u03b22 = \u03b21. Third, we require that the contraction C4 gives the threshold decomposition of the triangle skeleton. Matching the various levels, we find \u03b11 = \u22121/2 and \u03b21 = i/2. Fourth, we require that the integration I4 also gives the triangle. When we apply the operation I4, we find that it does not preserve the levels of the threshold decomposition. The easiest way to see this is that I4 returns terms that cannot be written by means of Pac and \u2206cd, because they depend on differences \u03c9i \u2212 \u03c9j of frequencies rather than just sums \u03c9i + \u03c9j . The corresponding singularities must cancel out, since they do not belong to the triangle skeleton. Their cancellation is achieved by means of identities like (B.4), whose right-hand sides contain remnants that correct the lower levels. Once we reorganize the decomposition properly, we can match the various levels as required. We then find \u03b31 = 1/6 and \u03b32 = \u2212\u03b12/2. After these substitutions we find that \u03b12 and \u03b24 multiply trivial terms, so we can set \u03b12 = \u03b24 = 0. At the end, we obtain the correct decomposition (6.11)."

The diagrammatic formulation of ref. [7] provides a particular solution to the problem considered here, i.e., map the usual amplitude V , which is defined by the time-ordered product (3.1) and satisfies the (pseudo)unitarity equation (2.3), into a unitary amplitude Vph = iTph. Since (2.16) is the most general solution to the problem, there must exist an \u2126 that turns V\u2126 into the diagrammatics of [7]. We denote it by \u2126ph(A). In the previous sections, we have shown how to derive \u2126ph(A), by requiring that the projection of a product diagram equals the product of its projected prime factors, and that this factorization property survives the basic operations of ascent and descent through the diagrams. This ensures, in particular, that \u2126ph(A) itself is diagrammatic. Its diagrams can be obtained by comparing those of [7] with those of V0, encoded in formula (2.10). The comparison must be done iteratively for each contribution to \u2126, as soon as it appears as an overall correction to some diagram. Now we show how to obtain the threshold decomposition of a diagram from formula (2.16). Once we choose the physical space Wph, we know A = \u03a0ph, which is the projector onto Wph. Let Vph(A) denote the physical solution V\u2126ph(A). Since Vph(A) depends just on V (A and B = C \u2212A being given), we can invert its expression and expand V in terms of Vph(A).\n\u2013 36 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\nLet us do this in the particular case A = |0\u3009\u30080|, where Wph is just made of the vacuum state |0\u3009. Then, the projection Vph(|0\u3009\u30080|) singles out the purely virtual contents of the diagrams. Inverting the formula (2.16) of Vph(|0\u3009\u30080|), we can write V as an expansion in powers of Vph(|0\u3009\u30080|): this is precisely the threshold decomposition of the Feynman diagrams collected in V .\nThe levels of the decomposition are the numbers of cuts, plus the levels of the \u2126ph(|0\u3009\u30080|) corrections. The latter are determined by comparison with what they correct, which is easier to do when they appear as overall corrections.\nLorentz invariance. The threshold decomposition of ref. [7] is not manifestly Lorentz invariant, because the skeleton diagrams are defined by ignoring the integrals on the space components of the loop momenta. It is easy to show that Lorentz invariance is recovered when those integrals are resumed. We recall that the projection to purely virtual particles amounts to consider the threshold decomposition, and remove the contributions where some delta functions, such as \u2206ab, depend on the frequencies \u03c9f of some purely virtual particles f. This operation is Lorentz invariant (as long as it is performed consistently in all the diagrams of the theory), since it amounts to remove a certain type of singularity everywhere from Feynman diagrams. Different types of singularities do not talk to one another. Formula (2.16) is manifestly Lorentz invariant, as long as the subspace Wph is Lorentz invariant and the \u2126 correction is \u2126ph(A). The Lorentz invariance of \u2126ph(A) follows by comparison between the projection obtained here and the one of [7].\nGauge symmetry, general covariance, generalized local symmetries. The physical amplitude Vph(A) is manifestly invariant under such symmetries, as long as A projects onto an invariant subspace Wph. This excludes subspaces containing the Faddeev-Popov ghosts, the temporal and longitudinal components of the gauge fields, etc. A quick way to prove the preservation of the symmetries is by means of the techniques recently developed in refs. [21, 22]. There, it was shown how to dress the elementary fields to make them manifestly gauge invariant, without altering the fundamental theory. Working with dressed fields, and recalling that they reduce to the ordinary elementary fields at the level of on-shell asymptotic states, it is evident that the operations involved in formula (2.16) are manifestly gauge invariant. As far as \u2126ph(A) is concerned, we can proceed as before, by comparison with [7], and recalling that: a) the projection to purely virtual particles amounts to remove certain types of singularities everywhere from Feynman diagrams; and b) different singularities do not talk to one another. Thus, once we assume that the physical space Wph is invariant (e.g., it is made of physically observable particles), the projection V \u2192 Vph(A) is invariant, and the preservation of symmetries is always guaranteed, including the cancellation of anomalies to all orders by means of the Adler-Bardeen theorem [23].3 The results of this paper extend to the off-shell amplitudes of gauge invariant fields defined in [21, 22]. We also recall that a particular projection is the one that gets rid of the\n3For a review and references, see also [24].

Applying the map V \u2192 Vph(A) to that case, we recover the proof of unitarity in gauge theories given in ref. [26].\nRenormalizability. The renormalizability of the projected amplitudes is manifest, whenever the unprojected amplitudes are renormalizable. Indeed, formula (2.16) tells us the reduced amplitude V\u2126 is equal to the usual amplitude V plus terms that involve one or more cuts. A single cut is sufficient to kill the overall divergence of a diagram, since the delta function due to the cut restricts the integration domain of the overall integral to a compact subset. The subdivergences are automatically taken care of as usual. The \u2126 corrections are compatible with renormalizability as long as they do not affect the zeroth levels of the threshold decomposition, as we have required. Finally, we remark that the difference V\u2126 \u2212 V between the projected amplitude and the time-ordered one vanishes identically when the incoming energy Ein is smaller than the mass of the lightest purely virtual particle. Indeed, the diagrams of V\u2126 \u2212 V contain at least one cut leg of type \u03c7, so they can be nontrivial only if Ein exceeds the \u03c7 mass. In particular, V\u2126 \u2212 V vanishes in the Euclidean region, and the renormalization of the projected theory coincides with the one of the parent Euclidean theory."

            "text": "We have formulated a new quantization principle for quantum field theory, based on a special type of non time-ordered product, and shown that it gives the theories of physical and purely virtual particles. The diagrams of the physical amplitude Vph = iTph are built by means of the usual vertices and propagators, plus non time-ordered propagators. The instructions to assemble the diagrams are encoded in a formula that maps the standard amplitude V = iT into Vph. If V obeys the unitarity or pseudounitarity equation, the most general reduced amplitude V\u2126 that obeys the unitarity equation depends on an arbitrary anti-Hermitian matrix \u2126. A special \u2126, called \u2126ph(A) in section 11, is determined by requiring that the projection of a product diagram is equal to the product of the projected factors, and that the factorization survives basic operations of ascent and descent through the diagrams. The idea is that the time ordering should be violated in a sort of \u201cminimum\u201d way, inside prime diagrams. The amplitude Vph(A) = V\u2126ph(A) coincides with the amplitude Vph of a theory of physical and purely virtual particles, as given in ref. [7]. We have worked out a number of techniques to relate different diagrams. Besides descending from bigger to smaller diagrams, it is also possible to ascend in a unique way from smaller to bigger diagrams, derive their \u2126 corrections, and match the threshold decompositions level by level. We have illustrated these properties in various examples. At one loop, we have considered the ascending chain bubble \u2192 triangle \u2192 box \u2192 penthagon \u2192 hexagon. At two loops, we have focused on the first nontrivial arrangement, which is the box with diagonal. In all the cases we have considered, nontrivial \u2126 corrections are present when the diagram factorizes, and when it factorizes under the contractions of some internal\n\u2013 38 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\nlegs. Moreover, it is always possible to ascend through the threshold decompositions in a unique way. We conjecture that these are general properties of the physical amplitude Vph. Purely virtual particles provide the most elegant way to break the crystal glass of time ordering. To give the reader an idea of how inelegant the most general solution (2.16) is, consider that, when \u2126 is generic (including \u2126 = 0), a diagram with non-amputated external legs is not straightforwardly related to the same diagram with amputated external legs, and has to be calculated anew. Moreover, the usual definitions of generating functionals of connected and irreducible Green functions do not apply. Only for \u2126 = \u2126ph(A), we have that, if Z(J) denotes the generating functional all the correlation functions, its logarithm W (J) = \u2212i lnZ(J) is the generating functional of the connected ones, and the W Legendre transform \u0393(\u03a6) = W (J)\u2212 \u222b \u03a6J , \u03a6 = \u03b4W/\u03b4J , is the generating functional of the amputated, one-particle irreducible ones. Yet, we cannot exclude that unforeseen physical principles might one day point to one of the many alternative options. In the absence of experimental data, the only thing we can do is single out the options that have remarkable formal and diagrammatic properties. In this spirit, it may be also worth to search for alternative \u2126 corrections, which may break the time ordering in non minimal ways, but have other interesting properties. In any case, the right solution chosen by nature must lie somewhere in formula (2.16), determined by the \u2126 that fits the physics.\nWe conclude with a brief summary of the formulations of purely virtual particles worked out so far. First, a nonanalytic Wick rotation was introduced in refs. [27], as a way to get rid of ghosts with complex masses, and reformulate the Lee-Wick models [28\u201333]. Its key ingredient is the average continuation around the branch cuts of amplitudes. It was soon realized that the procedure was actually a way to formulate models of new types, rather different from the original Lee-Wick idea (see [34] for a detailed comparison), and could be extended to remove ghosts with real masses (as well as physical particles), to give sense of quantum gravity as a power counting renormalizable theory, like the standard model [8]. The proof of unitarity to all orders in this approach was given in ref. [34].4\nThe second, equivalent formulation of purely virtual particles was introduced by means of the diagrammatic threshold decomposition of [7], and the spectral optical identities derived from it. The third formulation, equivalent to the other two, is the one of the present paper, based on the minimally non time-ordered product. With respect to [34], the gain offered by the two new formulations is considerable, not only for the clarity of the proofs to all orders, but also from the practical point of view. Indeed, the new formulations offer several ways to make calculations with not much more effort than computing Feynman diagrams (check [10]).\nWe end by mentioning some perspectives for the future. One goal is to develop the operatorial/Hamiltonian approach to purely virtual particles, and maybe study their quantum mechanics, where the evolution operator is no longer the usual time-ordered exponential, but follows from the minimally non time-ordered product. Another challenging objective is\n4For Lee-Wick approaches to quantum gravity, we address the reader to refs. [35\u201339].

[21, 22], where it was shown how to define off-shell physical amplitudes of colored states in QCD and point-dependent observables in quantum gravity, consistently with the (off-shell version of the) optical theorem. All in all, we think that we have achieved a satisfactory understanding of the nature of purely virtual particles, and revealed the main mysteries behind them, in view of the challenges just mentioned."

            "text": "Although the matrix V = iT is a collection of diagrams, in the paper we have been able to concentrate on single diagrams, and isolate the identities satisfied by them. In this appendix we show how to switch from T to single diagrams, with a different particle in each internal leg (and vice versa), with no loss and no gain of information. For definiteness, we start from a Lagrangian L(\u03d5) that depends on a single field \u03d5. We separate the kinetic (i.e., quadratic) part Lkin(\u03d5,m), where m denotes the mass of \u03d5, from the interaction part Lint(\u03d5, \u03bb) (made by anything that is not quadratic in \u03d5, including the linear terms, if present), where \u03bb denotes the couplings:\nL(\u03d5) = Lkin(\u03d5,m) + Lint(\u03d5, \u03bb). (A.1)\nThen we use a Pauli-Villars trick [20] to introduce many fields \u03d5i without changing the diagrams. Specifically, we replace the \u03d5 kinetic part with the sum of the \u03d5i kinetic parts, having the same mass. Moreover, we replace \u03d5 with the sum of all the \u03d5i in the interaction part:\nL\u2032(\u03d5) = N N\u2211 i=1 Lkin(\u03d5i,m) + Lint (\u03c6, \u03bb) , \u03c6 = N\u2211 i=1 \u03d5i. (A.2)\nThe diagrams GE with E external legs, generated by this Lagrangian, coincide with those generated by (A.1), multiplied by N\u2212E/2 and an appropriate combinatorial factor. To prove this, it is sufficient to note that each internal leg carries the \u03c6 propagator, which is the sum of the \u03d5i propagators, which in turn is equal to the \u03d5 propagator. We can choose the external legs \u03d5i we want, and the diagram GE is always the same, apart from the factors in front. At this point, we give a different mass mi to each field \u03d5i, and a different coupling \u03bbI to each vertex obtained by expanding the interaction part, where the subscript I refers to the various possibilities we have. We obtain\nLext(\u03d5) = N N\u2211 i=1 Lkin(\u03d5i,mi) + L\u0303int (\u03d5i, \u03bbI) ,\nfor a certain, new interaction Lagrangian L\u0303int. We know that we retrieve the diagrams GE of the starting theory when we set all the masses mi equal to m, and all the couplings \u03bbI equal to the appropriate values \u03bb.\n\u2013 40 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\nNow we show that the extended Lagrangian Lext(\u03d5) allows us to isolate the diagrams as needed. Let V = iT and Vext = iText denote the usual (unprojected) amplitudes, associated with L(\u03d5) and Lext(\u03d5), respectively. Let G and Gext denote diagrams contributing to them. For any G there exists a generalization Gext with the same topology as G, where each internal leg propagates a different field \u03d5i. It is sufficient to take N sufficiently large, to have a sufficient number of different fields \u03d5i, and differentiate Vext with respect to suitable couplings \u03bbI . After that, we set \u03bbI = 0 for every I. After building the diagram Gext with this method, we can study the diagrammatic identities satisfied by it, and build the projections we need, by differentiating formula (2.16) with respect to the appropriate couplings. If the \u2126 corrections are determined as explained in the paper, the right identities are obtained by differentiating (2.16) at \u2126 6= 0 as well. An advantage of Gext is that its combinatorics are trivial, since there is only one Wick contraction for each field \u03d5i participating in it. When we set the masses equal to one another, and identify the couplings appropriately to go back to the original theory (A.1)\u2013(A.2), several diagrams give identical contributions and restore the right combinatorics of L(\u03d5). In the paper, we built diagrams with independent internal legs and no external legs, replaced by external sources K. The sources can be replaced by products of physical fields without affecting the results we have obtained, as long as the external legs are amputated. When we need to include propagators on the external legs, we can use the factorization property, since we know that the right \u2126 gives the factorized result. With a generic \u2126, instead, the factorization property does not hold and we must redo the whole projection.\nB Identities for product distributions\nIn this appendix we prove some identities for product distributions that we have used in the paper. The first one is\nP \u222b +\u221e \u2212\u221e dy 2\u03c0 1 y(x+ y) = \u03c0 2 \u03b4(x), (B.1)\nwhere x is real.

Below, we reassure the reader that it is correct to use the decomposition (B.3) in products.\n\u2013 41 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\nMore quickly, formula (B.1) can be also proved from the identity\nP 1 x (1 y \u2212 1 x+ y ) \u2212 P 1 y(x+ y) = \u2212\u03c0 2\u03b4(x)\u03b4(y), (B.4)\nderived in ref. [7]. The y integral of the left term is convergent and gives zero, so the rest gives (B.1).\nThe second identity we need is\nP \u222b +\u221e \u2212\u221e dz 2\u03c0 1 (x+ z)(y + z)z = \u03c0 2P [ \u03b4(x) y + \u03b4(y) x \u2212 \u03b4(x\u2212 y) x ] . (B.5)\nWe start from the formula P [ 1 xyz \u2212 1 x+ y + z ( 1 xy + 1 xz + 1 yz )] = 0,\nwhich was derived again in ref. [7]. First, we reflect z to \u2212z, then translate x and y by z/2, finally rescale z by a factor 2. Integrating on z, we get\n0 = P \u222b +\u221e \u2212\u221e dz 2\u03c0 [ 1 (x+ z)(y + z)z + 1 x+ y ( 2 (x+ z)(y + z) \u2212 1 (x+ z)z \u2212 1 (y + z)z )] .\nEvery integral is separately convergent, so using (B.1) we obtain (B.5). Now we show that it is correct to use the decomposition (B.3) in products. Consider\u222b\n\u03c6(x, y) (x+ i )(y + i \u2032) ,\nwhere \u03c6(x, y) is a generic test function in two variables and the integral is over the plane xy, with measure dxdy/(2\u03c0)2. Decompose \u03c6(x, y) as the sum of\n\u03c6\u03c3\u03c4 (x, y) = 1 4 [\u03c6(x, y) + \u03c3\u03c6(\u2212x, y) + \u03c4\u03c6(x,\u2212y) + \u03c3\u03c4\u03c6(\u2212x,\u2212y)] ,\naccording to the x and y parities, where \u03c3 and \u03c4 can be +1 or \u22121. Note that\u222b \u03c6\u2212\u2212(x, y) (x+ i )(y + i \u2032) = \u222b \u03c6\u2212\u2212(x, y) xy = P \u222b \u03c6(x, y) xy ,\nsince \u03c6\u2212\u2212(x, y)/(xy) is regular for x \u223c 0 and y \u223c 0. Moreover,\u222b \u03c6\u2212+(x, y) (x+ i )(y + i \u2032) = \u2212i \u222b \u2032\u03c6\u2212+(x, y) (x+ i )(y2 + \u20322) = P \u222b \u2212i\u03c0\u03b4(y) x \u03c6(x, y) and \u222b \u03c6++(x, y)\n(x+ i )(y + i \u2032) = \u2212 \u222b \u2032\u03c6++(x, y) (x2 + 2)(y2 + \u20322) = \u2212 \u222b \u03c02\u03b4(x)\u03b4(y)\u03c6(x, y).\nThus,\u222b \u03c6(x, y) (x+ i )(y + i \u2032) = \u222b \u03c6++(x, y) + \u03c6\u2212+(x, y) + \u03c6+\u2212(x, y) + \u03c6\u2212\u2212(x, y) (x+ i )(y + i \u2032)\n= \u222b [ P 1 x \u2212 i\u03c0\u03b4(x) ] [ P 1 y \u2212 i\u03c0\u03b4(y) ] \u03c6(x, y).\n\u2013 42 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 8 8\nOpen Access.
