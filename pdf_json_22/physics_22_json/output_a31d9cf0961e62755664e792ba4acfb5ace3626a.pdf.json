    "abstractText": "We report the results of the experiment aimed at measuring the mobility of O2 ions in dense argon gas in the temperature range 180K \u2264 T \u2264 300K. We show that an adequate theoretical description of the data is obtained by using the thermodynamic Free Volume (FV) model, originally developed to describe the electron bubble mobility in superfluid helium and successfully exploited for describing the O2 mobility in near critical neon gas. The model goal is to thermodynamically predict the free space available for ion motion. By implementing the FV model with the Millikan-Cunningham (MC) slip correction factor, we can describe the ion mobility in the crossover region bridging the dilute gas kinetic regime to the high-density hydrodynamic regime of ion transport. These results confirm the validity of the model and the universality of some of its features.",

INTRODUCTION\nTHE detailed knowledge of the transport properties of ionsin dense gas- and liquid dielectrics is the cornerstone for understanding, designing, and harnessing processes in several natural as well as applicative fields. Control over biological processes, chemical synthesis protocols, electrical discharge equipment facilities, among many others, requires that the behavior of ions drifting under the action of electrical fields is known and/or predictable in advance. Also, the behavior of high-energy detectors [1] and low-temperature plasma processes is affected by the transport behavior of ions [2]. Moreover, the profound comprehension of the physico-chemical mechanisms of the processes occurring in the atmosphere, so important to ascertain several aspects of climate change, is based on the knowledge of the ion transport regimes [3]. Additionally, last but not least, the investigation on how ions drift in a dense disordered dielectric medium can shed light on the fundamental ion-neutral interaction mechanisms and provides pieces of information on the ion-neutral interaction potentials [4], [5].\nThis work benefited from the support of the project ZEROUATE under Grant ANR-19-CE24-0013 operated by the French National Research Agency (ANR).\nArmando Francesco Borghesani (corresponding author) is with CNISM Unit, Department of Physics & Astronomy, Universita\u0300 degli Studi, Padua, Italy (e-mail: armandofrancesco.borghesani@unipd.it) .\nFre\u0301de\u0301ric Aitken is with G2ELab, C.N.R.S., University of Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France (e-mail: frederic.aitken@g2elab.grenobleinp.fr)\nBoth authors are co-first authors.\nTypically, two different regimes for ion transport are considered. In dilute gases, the ion mobility \u00b5 is mainly determined by binary collisions with the host gas atoms and the classical kinetic theory gives an accurate description of \u00b5 as a function of electric field and temperature provided that the ion-atom scattering cross section is known and the appropriate collision integrals can be computed. Conversely, mobility data can be used to invert the equations of the classical kinetic theory to determine the interaction potential [6]\u2013[8]. If the neutral-ion interaction can be modeled as a hard-sphere interaction with hard-core radius R0, the density-normalized mobility \u00b5N of the ions in thermal equilibrium with the gas, as is the case of the present experiment, is obtained as\n\u00b5N = 3\n2\u03c3\n( \u03c0\n2mrkBT\n)1/2 (1)\nin which \u03c3 = \u03c0R20 is the scattering cross section, N is the gas number density, T is the temperature, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and mr is the ion-neutral reduced mass.\nAt the other boundary of the thermodynamic state of the medium, ions drift in a liquid and their thermal mobility is described by the Stokes hydrodynamic formula\n\u00b5N = eN\n6\u03c0\u03b7R (2)\nin which e is the charge of the (singly charged) ion, \u03b7 is the gas viscosity, and R is the so-called hydrodynamic (or, effective) radius, which is assumed to be a constant for a given ionneutral pair [9], [10].\nHowever, this experiment, as several more similar ones [11]\u2013[13], is carried out in a dense gas, for which a fullfledged theory for ion transport encompassing the crossover region between the dilute gas limit and the hydrodynamic regime is absent. Moreover, negative ions are not extensively investigated as the positive ones because of the difficulty of their production. Whereas positively charged ions are produced by direct ionization, the formation of a negative ion goes through several steps, which may not necessarily occur in the correct sequence. Firstly, low-energy electrons must be captured by electronegative molecular impurities. Then, the vibrationally excited transient anions thus formed quickly decay by autodetachment but a fraction of them can be stabilized by collisions with a third body, typically a host gas atom that carries away the excess energy [14], [15]. Only this fraction of ions is sufficiently long-lived to allow the experimenters to measure their mobility.

            "text": "of stable ions is made available because this negative ion production mechanism is not efficient and strongly depends on the environment. The delicate balance of short-range repulsive exchange forces acting between the excess electron in the ion and the electronic clouds of the surrounding atoms, and the long-range polarization interaction leads to the birth of a state that cannot adiabatically be obtained by simply adding an ion to the medium. Therefore, negative ions are endowed with a structure more complicated than that of cations. The ion is localized in an empty cavity surrounded by a solvation shell produced by electrostriction. The properties of the structure depend on the atomic polarizability of the gas and on its thermodynamic state [16]\u2013[19].\nOver the years, we have been carrying out several experimental investigations on the mobility of O\u22122 ions in dense noble gases in wide temperature and density ranges [11]\u2013[13], [20]. Oxygen is the most ubiquitous and important attaching species for evident reasons and is readily available as an impurity even in the best purified gas. Being the same ionic species in different gases its behavior sheds light on gas specific features.\nThe choice to carry out measurements in a supercritical or near-critical gas is dictated by the fact that the gas density can be varied at will by changing pressure or temperature. By so doing, also the Knudsen number, Kn = `(N,T )/R, which is the ratio of the mean free path ` of the neutrals to the ion effective radius, can be varied in quite a range, thereby bridging the Kn 1 hydrodynamic regime to the Kn \u2265 1 kinetic regime.\nAs pointed out several times [11]\u2013[13], [20]\u2013[22], in the broad temperature and density ranges we have explored, neither the kinetic- nor the hydrodynamic description of the experimental data are adequate. However, a thermodynamic model (the FV model) has been recently developed that aims at computing the N and T dependence of the free volume available for the ion motion via an equation of state (EOS) [23]\u2013[25]. The size of the free volume, which is of spherical shape based on symmetry arguments, is assumed to be the effective ion radius to be inserted in the Stokes formula of the hydrodynamic regime. The extension of the model prediction to smaller densities to describe the crossover region towards the kinetic regime is obtained by adopting a suitably modified form of the Millikan-Cunningham slip correction factor [26]\u2013[28].\nDespite being originally developed to describe the mobility of electron bubbles in superfluid Helium, the model has proven very effective to also describe the mobility of any kind of ions in several liquids and gases. We have successfully adopted this FV model to describe the mobility of O\u22122 ions in dense (supercritical and near-critical) Neon gas [21], [22] in extremely broad N and T ranges.\nOwing to the efficacy of the FV model and to test its validity for other systems we have carried out measurements of the O\u22122 mobility in Argon gas in the temperature range 180 K \u2264 T \u2264 300 K. We report here the new data and the result of their analysis with the FV model."

The experimental cell can be pressurized up to \u2248 8 MPa and its temperature regulated within \u00b10.01 K in the range 25 K \u2264 T \u2264 340 K. O\u22122 are produced by resonant electron attachment to O2 molecular impurities in a concentration of a few p.p.m. [21]. Pressure readings are accurate within \u00b12 kPa. The gas density is computed by means of an accurate equation of state [29]. A d.c., high-voltage generator energizes the drift capacitor up to a maximum voltage of \u2248 3 kV. The drift distance is d \u2248 1 cm. The drift signal is passively integrated to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and the drift time is obtained by the analysis of the signal waveforms [30]. The explored range of reduced electric field is limited to E/N \u2264 40 mTd (1 mTd=10\u221224 V m2). Thus, the ions always are in thermal equilibrium with the gas and their mobility \u00b5 turns out to be field independent even at the lowest N , as can be realized by inspecting Fig. 1 and.

This observation is confirmed by these new measurements. We report in Fig. 3 the measured values of \u00b5N as a function of the density N\nfor T = 180 K as closed points with error bars. The solid line is only a linear fit to the data. To ascertain if this density dependence might stem from the type of interaction potential, we also carried out Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations as done elsewhere [31]. The MD results, shown as closed squares in Fig. 3, have a completely different density dependence than the experimental data. However, the MD results can be reconciled with the experimental data (open diamonds in Fig. 3) if they are weighted by the number of nearest neighbors provided by the MD simulations shown in Fig. 4.\nThis observation clearly indicates that the ion mobility is strongly affected by the environment and that a description of the mobility in the crossover density region must be able to account for the structure of the ion environment. The goal of the FV model is just to provide a thermodynamic approach to description of the structure of the ion-medium complex."

The main reasons for the success of the FV model in different systems are that it computes in a thermodynamical way the effective ion radius, therefore accounting for the structure surrounding the ion itself, and that it exploits a modified form of the MC slip correction factor to bridge the two limiting transport regimes.\nThe cornerstone of the FV model is the concept of free volume Vf , i.e., the volume available for the ionic motion through the medium. Ions are the solute species in the gas that acts as a solvent. The free volume is given by Vf = V \u2212 b, in which V is the macroscopic volume occupied by the gas and b the covolume of its atoms. As the ion number produced in the experiment is extremely low (their concentration is \u2264 10\u221214), their covolume can safely be neglected.\nThe free volume per particle Vs = Vf/N is described by a van der Waals-like EOS\nVs = Vf N = kBT P + \u03a0 (3)\nP \u2261 P (N,T ) is the hydrostatic pressure, which incorporates the attractive potential energy contributions among neutrals, and \u03a0 is the internal pressure that accounts for the excess attractive potential energy contributions in the systems, i.e., those due by the long-range polarization interaction between ions and neutrals. The simplest analytical form for the internal pressure is\n\u03a0 = \u03b1N2 (4)\nin which \u03b1 is a constant that determines the density at which the compressibility is maximum and that has been proved to be system-independent according to the analysis of several ion-gas- and ion-liquids systems [21], [24], [32], [33].\nOwing to the spherical symmetry of the ion-neutral interaction, Vs is assumed to have spherical shape and its radius is considered to be the effective hydrodynamics radius R. As we expect that the size of the solvation shell depends on the ion-gas system compressibility, we must seek an analytic form relating R to Vs that accounts for this effect"

The Knudsen number is evaluated by using the kinetic theory expression for the mean free path of the neutrals [34]\n`(N,T ) = 3\u03b7 N \u221a 8mrkBT/\u03c0 (6)\nAs the experiment is carried out at temperature quite higher than the critical one, we can use a version for the hydrodynamic radius with a much simpler temperature dependence than that used for neon gas close to the critical temperature [21], [22]. Thus, we assume\nR\nR0 = 1 +\n(V0/Vs) 1\n1 + \u03b3 (V0/Vs) (7)\nin which the parameters R0, i.e., the hard-sphere radius of the ion-medium interaction, \u03b3, 1, and the free volume of a suitable reference state, V0 = \u03b4kBT , have all to be adjusted to give the best agreement with the experimental mobility data. We found R0 = 0.555 nm, 1 = 12, and \u03b3 = 2. Moreover, we found that \u03b1 = 0.8937 MPa\u00b7nm6 and \u03b4 = 0.15 m3/J. It is worth noting that the present values of \u03b1 and \u03b4 are the same that give the best agreement in all investigated systems [21]\u2013[24], [32], [33] and also in several cation-liquids systems not yet published. Thus, the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b4 appear to be universal. We believe that this universality arises as a consequence of adopting a van der Waals-like approach to the ion-gas thermodynamic description that leads to the manifestation of a sort of Law of Corresponding States.\nFinally, the slip correction factor can be cast in the form\n\u03c6(N,T ) = A ( Nc N ) (8)\nin which Nc \u2248 80.8 \u00d7 1026 m\u22123 is the critical density of Argon, A \u2248 1/4 and \u2248 1.1."

            "text": "In Fig. 5 we compare the predictions of the FV model with the experimental data for T = 180 K and T = 260 K. Similar results are obtained for all other investigated isotherms. We note that the values of the free parameters appearing in (4), in (7), and in (8) have been determined once for all by seeking agreement between the T = 180 K experimental data and the model and retain their values through all other isotherms. As\nwe can see, the agreement between model and experiment is satisfactory.\nWe note that the value of the parameter is slightly larger than 1. This value would be problematic in the limit of zero density. However, the value \u2248 1.1 is obtained by a global fit of the ratio of the mean free path to the hydrodynamic radius over all the investigated density range. Actually, we found that depends on N in such a way that = 1 at low density and \u2192 1.2 at high density. We believe that this behavior is an artifact of the choice of using the kinetic expression of the mean free path that involves the dynamic viscosity of the gas instead of using the simpler expression ` = 1/N\u03c3, in which, unfortunately, the scattering cross section \u03c3 is not known. We further observe that in the real experiment the true zero-density limit is not even closely approached. Actually, the lowest density we achieved is of the order of 1 \u00d7 1026 m\u22123, i.e., roughly 4 times the density of an ideal gas at a pressure of 1 atm and at a temperature of 0\u25e6 C.\nThe FV model also can predict that the effective hydrodynamic radius bridging the hydrodynamic- to the kinetic transport regime over the density crossover region is cast in the form\nReff = R\n1 + \u03c6 (9)\nwhich has to be compared to its experimental determination Reff = e/6\u03c0\u03b7\u00b5. The comparison of the two determinations of the effective radius is shown in Fig. 6. We only report the results for T = 180 K because its investigated density range is the broadest among all isotherms. Moreover, the resulting temperature dependence of Reff is so weak that no further insight is gained by plotting the results for all remaining temperatures.\nOn one hand, we note that the pure hydrodynamic radius R is almost constant throughout the whole investigated density range. This fact implies that the experiment has been carried out in the crossover density region but on the low-density side of it. Consequently, the pure Stokes formula would certainly fail at describing the mobility data.\nBORGHESANI AND AITKEN: FREE VOLUME MODEL ANALYSIS OF THE O\u22122 ION MOBILITY IN DENSE AR GAS 5\nOn the other hand, we see that the agreement between the model prediction and the experimental determination of the effective radius is quite good. We observe that Reff linearly depends on N at very low density. This means that in this limit \u00b5N turns out to be independent of the density as required by the kinetic theory. As the density is increased, the effective radius increases with decreasing slope and tends to a saturation value, thereby approaching the pure hydrodynamic radius and, hence, the hydrodynamic regime.\nWe can conclude that in the explored temperature and density ranges, in particular at temperatures quite higher than the critical one, the most important factor to get agreement with the experimental data is to implement the results of the free volume model with a suitable form of the slip correction factor. The same conclusions apply to all investigated isotherms.\nAlthough the model has been developed in such a way to extend the Stokes formula to relatively low densities, nonetheless it also predicts quite correctly the temperature dependence of the zero-density limit of the density-normalized mobility, (\u00b5N)0, defined as\n(\u00b5N)0 = limN\u21920 \u00b5N (10)\nWe show in Fig. 7 the temperature dependence of the experimentally determined (\u00b5N)0 and the prediction of the FV model. In spite that the accuracy of (\u00b5N)0 is relatively poor because it is obtained by extrapolating the available experimental data to N \u2192 0, nonetheless it appears that the FV model gives a satisfactory description of the experimental outcome. We must stress the fact that, although we reached the lowest possible densities in the experiment, nonetheless we are by far distant from the pure kinetic regime. Actually, in the limit N \u2192 0, (\u00b5N)0 should be be given by the so-called polarization (or, Langevin) limit [35]\n(\u00b5N)0 = 4.81\u00d7 10\u22124 \u221a mr\u03b1s \u2248 6.9\u00d7 1021 (V m s)\u22121 (11)\nin which \u03b1s = 11.08 a30 is the atomic polarizability of Argon, a0 is the Bohr radius, and mr \u2248 2.95\u00d710\u221225 kg is the O\u22122 -Ar\nreduced mass. This picture once more confirms the efficacy of the FV model at treating the transition transport regime."

The measurements are carried out for densities that are too large for the pure kinetic theory to apply and too low for the hydrodynamic theory to be valid. The measurements thus explore a crossover region between the two limiting transport regimes.\nWe have shown, by means of Molecular Dynamics simulations, that the structure of the fluid surrounding the ions does determine their transport behavior.\nThe free volume model that treats the ions as a low concentration solute in a solvent is just aimed at computing the volume associated with each ion that is available for its motion by introducing a van der Waals-like equation of state for the solute. The linear size of this volume is assumed to be the ion hydrodynamic radius to appear in the hydrodynamical Stokes formula.\nThe model, although relying on some adjustable parameters, nonetheless shows some universal features. First, the hydrodynamic radius turns out to be a function of the free volume. Moreover, the expressions for the internal pressure \u03a0 and of the volume of a reference thermodynamical state V0 turn out to be common to all investigated systems and are thus universal. We believe that this universality stems from a sort of Law of Corresponding States following the van der Waalslike approach. Finally, the model parameter, adjusted to fit one specific isotherm, keep their values though all remaining isotherms.\nTo bridge the high- to the low-density regions the Stokes formula for the mobility is supplemented with the introduction of a suitable slip correction factor in the wake of the work of Millikan and Cunningham.

He is actively contributing to all International Conferences on Dielectric Liquids (ICDL) since 1990 and was awarded the Hans Tropper Award at ICDL 2022.\nBORGHESANI AND AITKEN: FREE VOLUME MODEL ANALYSIS OF THE O\u22122 ION MOBILITY IN DENSE AR GAS 7\nFre\u0301de\u0301ric Aitken (born in Grenoble, France, 1969) graduated in Mechanics from Grenoble Joseph Fourier University and Aeronautical Engineering School in Toulouse. In1994-1995 he was appointed engineer at Institute Max Planck, where he was in charge of the study of cooling of resistive magnetic coils of Polyhelix type. He passed his Ph. D. degree in 1998 and joined the CNRS as a full researcher shortly after. 2010-2014, he was appointed as President of the French Physical Society (SFP-Alpes). His\nresearches are focused on the investigation of fast energy injection in dielectric liquids for characterization of phase change induced by corona-like discharges. Making relations of his own with renowned scientists he became a specialist of non-equilibrium thermodynamic and transport properties in these fluids."
