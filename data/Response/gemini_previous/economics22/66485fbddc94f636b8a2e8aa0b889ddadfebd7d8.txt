1. **Investigate the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on humanitarian and development funding.** How will the pandemic continue to impact the flow of funding from high-income countries to low- and middle-income countries? What are the implications for the sustainability of development programs?


2. **Examine the impact of reduced funding on the quality of health services in low- and middle-income countries.** How does the reduction in funding affect the availability of essential health services, such as antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, and emergency obstetric care? What are the consequences for maternal and child health?


3. **Explore the role of data and contextual information in decision-making during program transitions.** How can data be used to identify priority health facilities and services? How can contextual information, such as geographic factors and historical contexts, be incorporated into the decision-making process?


4. **Develop strategies for ensuring the sustainability of development programs in low- and middle-income countries.** How can programs be designed to be more resilient to funding cuts? What are the roles of governments, donors, and implementing partners in ensuring sustainability?


5. **Evaluate the effectiveness of flexible program arrangements in responding to changing funding availability.** How do flexible program arrangements, such as short-term partnerships and buffer implementation periods, help to minimize the impact of funding cuts? What are the challenges and opportunities associated with these arrangements?
