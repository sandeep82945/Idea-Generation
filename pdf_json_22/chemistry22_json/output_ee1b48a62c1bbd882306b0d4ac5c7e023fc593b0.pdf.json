    "abstractText": "Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is often used for biomolecular detection based on the interaction of a molecule with a receptor functionalised electrode surface and consequent impedance change. Though its performance is well established, there is still a need for improved sensitivity and specificity, especially when attempting to detect nucleic acids from clinical samples with minimal amplification steps. Localised heating is a potential approach for improving nucleic hybridisation rates and reducing non-specific interactions, and thereby producing high sensitivity and selectivity. The aim of the study was therefore to develop a microheater surrounding Au thin film electrodes, an integrated hybrid chip, for detecting genes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with enhanced sensitivity. The performance of the integrated hybrid chip was determined using the changes in the charge transfer resistance (Rct) upon DNA hybridisation using probe sequences for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Heat transfer within the system was simulated by using COMSOL Multiphysics as a mathematical modelling tool. When a temperature of 50 \u00b0C was applied to the microheater during DNA hybridisation steps, Rct values (which were indicative of DNA-DNA hybridisation) increased 236% and 90% as opposed to offchip non-heated experiments and off-chip heated experiments. It is concluded from these observations that the microheater indeed can significantly improve the performance of the nucleic acid hybridisation assay and paves the way for the development of highlysensitive and specific integrated label-free biosensors.

            "text": "1\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is often used for biomolecular detection based on the interaction of a molecule with a receptor functionalised electrode surface and consequent impedance change. Though its performance is well established, there is still a need for improved sensitivity and specificity, especially when attempting to detect nucleic acids from clinical samples with minimal amplification steps. Localised heating is a potential approach for improving nucleic hybridisation rates and reducing non-specific interactions, and thereby producing high sensitivity and selectivity. The aim of the study was therefore to develop a microheater surrounding Au thin film electrodes, an integrated hybrid chip, for detecting genes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with enhanced sensitivity. The performance of the integrated hybrid chip was determined using the changes in the charge transfer resistance (Rct) upon DNA hybridisation using probe sequences for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Heat transfer within the system was simulated by using COMSOL Multiphysics as a mathematical modelling tool. When a temperature of 50 \u00b0C was applied to the microheater during DNA hybridisation steps, Rct values (which were indicative of DNA-DNA hybridisation) increased 236% and 90% as opposed to offchip non-heated experiments and off-chip heated experiments. It is concluded from these observations that the microheater indeed can significantly improve the performance of the nucleic acid hybridisation assay and paves the way for the development of highly- sensitive and specific integrated label-free biosensors.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 A cc t\nd M\n2\nKeywords: electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, lab-on-a-chip, microheater, DNA hybridisation sensitivity\n1. Introduction\nRecently, development of new reliable diagnostic methodologies has received a lot of attention. In this regard, biosensors are one of the ideal candidates for use at the point of care because of their capability to monitor and evaluate chemical and biological effects by producing signals either optical, electrical, or electrochemical [1-5]. Since biosensors offer many advantages as alternatives to conventional methods, they have been employed in many scientific and industrial areas such as chemistry [6] engineering [7], biology [8] by utilising various types of bioreceptors like enzymes [9], cells [10], and aptamers [11]. Particularly, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) can investigate in detail the relation between chemical and electrochemical effects via the passage of electric current between the solution and the electrode [12-14]. When electron transfer begins, as a result of an electrochemical reaction, the resistance of this process is called charge transfer resistance (Rct) and is commonly used in biosensor measurements to determine whether the bioreceptors on the surface have successfully bound to their target [12].\nElectrochemical impedance-based DNA biosensors for nucleic acid hybridisation are highly sensitive measurement tools, because, they are label-free possessing significant advantages such as not requiring extra assay steps or resources to label the target, making them lower cost, faster, and more portable over many labelled detection systems [15]. EIS-based DNA biosensors typically employ the three electrodes system which includes working, counter and reference electrodes. Electrons transfer takes place at the working electrode which is often functionalised with nucleic acid sequences or proteins [16]. There are several examples to EIS-based DNA biosensors in the literature. For example, Rainbow et al., reported a coft-effective and fast-responsive integrated electrochemical biosensors to detect waterbone disease [17]. Low cost and low resource micro/nano sensors was developed on flexible substrates by Bamshad et al [18]. Photonic crystal slab (PCS) was developed to investigate complex gases at ng level detection by Biswas et al [19]. Analysis of single-cell was performed with the help of the microfluidic system integrated electrical impedance by Kim et al [20]. Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) integrated glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was develop for monitoring Doxorubicin Anticancer Drug, and the limit of detection achieved 0.6 nM [21]. Detection of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was performed electrochemical biosensors with operating quantum dot (QD) [22]. An electrochemical biosensor that operate without the need for pre-treatment was also developed for the discovery of viruses with a limit of detection of 6 \u03bcg/mL [23]. Peng et al., studied label-free DNA biosensors based on cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy for rapid detection of multidrug resistance MDR1 gene [24]. Blair et al., showed Mycobacterium tuberculosis detection on gold microelectrode produced through photolithography [25]. Yao et al. presented a biosensor that determined mercury ions through use of labelled nucleic acid multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) [26]. These studies generally employ nanoparticles, exotic electrode modification and labelled PCR systems and are therefore not amenable\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 A cc ep te d M a\nus rip\nt\n3\nto mass manufacture and therefore widespread use. In addition, selectivity and specificity issues are rarely addressed and so many promising assays do not reach maturity because of an inability to properly discriminate between specific and non-specific nucleic acid interactions, particularly in complex clinical samples.\nDNA hybridisation specificity can be increased through imposition of elevated temperature, especially around the melting temperature (TM) of the DNA duplex. Hybridisation standard free energy is low at high-temperature and therefore mismatches can be minimized [27-29]. It should be noted that these studies were carried out primarily using hybridisation simulations [30]. Zhang et al., investigated temperature dependent hybridisation performance by evaluating thermodynamics [27]. Javed et al., manufactured a microheater platform to detect DNA attachment using a fluorescence labelled method [31]. Consequently, based on the knowledge in the field, one can conclude that elevated temperatures increase DNA hybridisation specificity. Heating effect in sensor experiments has been previously reported by several groups. Husueh et al., worked with microheater integrated MEMS gas sensors with blue light-emitting diode (LED) and microheater was employed to increase the temperature of sensing layer, resulting in an increase in the response of the sensor [32]. Das et al., investigated co-planar MEMS gas sensor integrated microheater to enhance the sensor response using Pt-made microheater [33]. Chen et al., developed MEMS gas sensor to detect low concentration gases and Pt-microheater was integrated to increase detection sensitivity [34]. The specific detection of gases was accomplished by microheater integrated gas sensor. In this study, by integrating a microheater alongside an electrochemical sensor, a hybrid integrated chip was produced to increase the sensitivity of DNA hybridisation. Effect of heating in electrochemical sensor experiments has also been reported in the literature. Temperature and kinetic conditions of hybridization was examined to detect single base mismatches by square wave voltammetry by Biala et al [35]. Electrochemical sensors with heated gold-disk electrode was performed to examine the electrocatalytic activity of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) [36]. These are rather off-chip bulk experiments. Zhang et al. developed a sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) aptasensor using heated indium thin oxide (ITO) working electrode surface by applying heat via semi-integrated electrical connections [37]. In another setting, the off-chip hybridization experiment was carried out with using heated gold disk electrode immersed in water at 50\u00b0C by Reske et al. [38]. Flechsig et al. worked with heated gold disk electrode for the detection of DNA hybridization using a similar bulk experimental set-up immersed in water at 50\u00b0C, where detection limit was determined to be 3.2 nM [39]. Both of these experiments were not performed using impedance spectroscopy, but other electrochemical analysis. It is clear to us that though there are several examples on heated electrode systems for electrochemical sensor applications, to the best of our knowledge, a fully integrated microelectrochemical sensor containing microelectrodes and a microheater on a single platform has not been presented for DNA hybridisation experiments and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy-based detection.\nThe goal of this study was therefore to produce simple planar chip bearing gold microelectrodes surrounded by a microheater electrode, and to investigate the effect of microheater functionality on\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 A cc ep t d M an us cr ip t\n4\nspecific DNA hybridisation. The design and incorporation of electrodes provided an opportunity to exert control over temperature for improving assay sensitivity and specify. The results presented here showed the initial modelling and fabrication of a highly-sensitive integrated label-free biosensor, followed by characterisation of the assay performance on the system with comparison to a benchmark electrode model.\n2.

The design of the chip and the fabrication procedure [40] are shown in Figure 1A and Figure 1B. The integrated hybrid chip was fabricated on 25 mm by 25 mm glass slides by thermal evaporation (NANOVAK- Turkey) through a shadow mask at Bilkent University (UNAM, Turkey) (Figure 1B-I). Glass slides and shadow mask, were cleaned with acetone and then dried with nitrogen gas. Initially, 100 nm of chromium (Cr) (99.99%) was evaporated to form an adhesion layer between glass and gold (Figure 1B-II). 300 nm of gold (Au) (99.99%) was then deposited on the adhesion layer, as shown in Figure 1B-III. After the removal of the shadow mask, the final chip was obtained, as shown in Figure 1B-IV and photography image of fabricated hybrid chip shown in Figure 1C. In order to ease the handling of the chip and provide efficient connection between the electrode/microheater contact pad and the power supply/ PalmSens, a specific chip holder was designed and manufactured from plexiglass (PMMA).\nFigure 1.

The microheater surrounded the working electrodes at a distance of 4000 \u00b5m while the counter/reference electrodes were placed outside the heating zone of the heater (see Figure 1A). The Dektak profiling of the electrodes showed that the overall thickness of Cr and Au electrodes was about 230 \u00b5m while the width was 1000 \u00b5m. The function of the heater was to generate and maintain the desired temperature during target hybridisation. Here, the temperature profile should be homogeneously distributed with maximum efficiency while consuming minimum energy [42]. The microheater integrated electrode \u2013 the integrated hybrid chip - was fabricated on a glass slide after the deposition of the metal electrodes. Power generator was connected to the microheater contact pads with the help of crocodile tips. Simply, the working mechanism is that the electrons collide with the atoms of the heater material (Au, Cr) with the applied current, and the heating process of the microheater takes place by transferring some of their energy to the atoms.\nCOMSOL Multiphysics modelling was performed three-dimensional in order to simulate the temperature distribution on the chip at 50 \u00b0C and provide an initial insight into the power/duration requirements for experimentation. This operating temperature (50 \u2070C) was determined as being close enough to the melting temperature of the target DNA to maximise specific and minimise non-specific DNA-DNA hybridisation [27- 30]. Simulation results obtained at 50 \u00b0C are shown in Figure 2A. The heating reached a desired maximum value of 50 \u00b0C at the centre of the working electrode. The temperature in the hybrid chip was uniformly distributed. The temperature in the circle, where the working electrode forms its centre and involves the microheater, was simulated as 50 \u00b0C (in air) and this temperature value was obtained within approximately 1 min. Heat transfer of the liquid sample and the glass substrate was disregarded for simplicity. The main goal of this study was to place the working electrode in the middle of the microheater and to benefit from the temperature distribution homogeneously. It has also been shown by COMSOL that the temperature decreases with distance from the working electrode. Furthermore, different mesh parameters were also tested. When the mesh parameters were increased from coarse to extremely fine, as shown in Table S2, there was no significant change observed. Therefore, 300 \u00b5m for maximum element size and 200 \u00b5m for maximum element size were used in all simulation studies.\nExperimental results are shown in Figure 2B and Figure 2C, displaying the temperature change with applied power at 1 min and required duration to reach the desired temperature for 3 W. Power was varied from 0.29 W to 0.32 W and the duration ranged between 1 and 1.5 min. Experimentally, as seen from the figures, the power required to reach 50 \u00b0C was determined as 0.3 W (5 V \u2013 a DC current of 1.42 A). Figure 2A demonstrates the required duration for the heating to reach 50 \u00b0C and it appeared that the optimal duration was approximately 1 min. When a power of 1.68 W was applied, the chip fractured at a temperature of 158 \u00b0C, herewith the maximum temperature that the microheater can withstand has been tested.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 A cc ep te d\na us\ncr ip\nt\n8"

            "text": "In the last decade, studies on biosensors have considerably increased in number and focused on improving the performance and capabilities of biosensor devices [43-45]. In the literature, nucleic acid based biosensors have been frequently reported for use under ambient conditions [46, 47]. In this study, we focused on the improvement of EIS-based nucleic acid biosensors by employing a microheater\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\n60 A cc\npt\n9\nintegrated electrode chip. Experiments were divided into off-chip and on-chip. The off- chip measurements were performed using C223AT SPEs heated on an incubator and on-chip measurements were carried out using the fabricated heat generating electrodes as described above. In order to ease the fabrication procedure, both the sensing electrodes and the heat generating electrodes, the microheater were fabricated from Au and a thin Cr adhesion layer. On-chip and off-chip experiments were carried out at temperatures of 25 \u00b0C and 50 \u00b0C. The temperature of 50 \u00b0C was chosen to improve sensitivity and to decrease non-specific target hybridisation, because this temperature was close to the melting temperature of the target DNA sequence [27].\nCV measurements were performed using C223AT in 1 mM FF to determine the cleaning efficacy. In off-chip experiments, the value of peak-to-peak separation was 80 mV, which is close to the ideal value of 58 mV according to the Nernst Equation, indicating that the cleaning process has been successful [48]. Rct values were calculated for overall experimental steps in FF solution. The EIS outcomes are illustrated using a Nyquist plot, as shown in Figure 3A. The increasing Rct value at each stage indicated that immobilization and hybridisation were successful. The EIS Nyquist plots show that the change in Rct value after target hybridisation at 50 \u00b0C was higher than that observed for room temperature incubation. This suggests that hybridisation at 50 \u00b0C indeed enhanced the hybridisation sensitivity [42].\nAs for on-chip experiments, peak-to-peak separation was calculated to be 100 mV, which is satisfactory though larger than the SPE and the theoretical value stated above. This could in part be explained by the use of thin gold film which has slightly higher resistance than a thickly deposited gold screen printing ink. The Nyquist plots for each measurement steps are illustrated in Figure 3B and the Rct values displayed show similar increases for SPEs.\nFigure 3 Nyquist plots. (A) Nyquist plot of off-chip experiments for each measurement steps, (B) Nyquist plot of on-chip experiments for each measurement steps. C; complimentary, NC; noncomplimentary.\nFigure 4 demonstrates signal change magnitudes for Rct after complementary and non-complementary target hybridisation at different temperatures. At room temperature, the mean signal change of the SPE showed an increase of 93% while the chip response increased by 147%. This could be due to the uneven\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\n60 A cc\ne\nte d\nM nu\nsc rip\nt\n10\nconnection of the DNA probe to the electrode surface due to the rough structure of the SPEsleading to sub-optimal hybridisation [46] or the improved electroanalytical performance offered by reducing the electrode dimensions in the hybrid chip. In short, the signal change for SPEs were less than that of the hybrid device. Our results indicate similar characteristics with the literature [50].\nHybridisation of the complementary target at 50 \u00b0C resulted in an increase of the electrochemical hybridisation signal by 236% for the chip and 146% for the SPE. This shows a higher singal change in comparison with both electrode systems at 25 \u00b0C. The increase is in line with the expectations that the incubation of target DNA close to the melting temperature of the DNA sequences of interest allows for specific hybridisation and increases the rate of hybridisation events within the sample [28-30]. These results also prove the enhanced specificity and selectivity with the use of microheater integrated electrodes, the hybrid chip and therefore higher efficacy with the microheater. There are a few studies in the literature which use microheaters. For example, Javed et al., fabricated a platinum microheater platform to detect DNA using fluorescence labelling [31]. Safavieh et al., reported a biosensor for real time and label-free bacteria isolation from whole blood and antibiotic susceptibility testing [51]. To achieve 37 \u00b0C for the on-chip bacteria incubation, a screen-printed heater was electrically characterized. In our study, an Au-made microheater surrounding the electrode heated at 50 \u00b0C was successfully implemented to increase the hybridisation sensitivity of nucleic acids.\nNon-complementary experiments were also carried out and indicated that the probe and target binding are specific for both temperatures investigated, because changes in charge transfer resistance for the non-complementary targets are much lower than the complementary targets (Figure 4). In the case of the on-chip system, the non-complementary measurement gave a lower signal change at 50 \u2103 than that at 25 \u2103, indicating improved specificity of the higher temperature incubation. Therefore, the EIS results with non-complementary target confirm sensor specificity of the experiments and enhanced discrimanatory power for the assay at elevated temperature. The signal change magnitude of chip samples were more than that of SPE samples at both temperatures, which is due to the smooth and more defect-free surface of the electrodes. For most measurements, this also gave rise to a lower signal variation for the on-chip electrodes. A two-tailed t-test was performed to compare complementary and non-complementary target hybridisation signals and the outcome of the t-tests proved that there were statistically significant differences between the two, shown in Figure 4. This difference was even more enhanced when the incubation was performed at 50 \u2103. Higher signal changes were also observed at 50 \u2103 on the SPEs, giving confidence that incubating at higher temperature improved sensitivity.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 A cc ep\nd M\nan us\ncr ip\nt\n11"

This indicates the surface roughness was considerably higher for the SPEs. The difference is a consequence of the rough surface of the SPE, leading to less controllable formation of the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) with more variable surface coverage than that of the smooth chip which results in the improved performance of the chip in the hybridisation experiments with non-complementary target at 50 \u00b0C [49- 52].\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed to characterize surface properties of SPEs and chip (Au coating electrode).

Conclusion\nIn this study, we present the development of a novel microheater integrated electrode with enhanced DNA hybridisation sensitivity based on EIS experiments. The microheater electrode and the EIS electrode were both made of Au deposited on a thin Cr layer on a glass slide through a shadow mask. Production is facile and low cost because the same shadow mask can be used to produce both electrodes and there is no need for any photolithography steps. The results of the experimental heating tests were in line with the simulations, indicating that a power of 0.3 W was sufficient to reach the desired temperature, 50 \u00b0C, within a min. Sensitivity was increased about 50% and 90% when the hybrid chip was used at room temperature and 50 \u00b0C, respectively, compared to the off-chip experiments. Enhanced sensitivity and selectivity are a result of the surface properties of the electrodes, as shown by AFM images, and most importantly the use of microheater around the electrode. We believe that the concept of integrated microheater is a novel approach in improving the assay performance in not only EIS-based susceptibility assays as such, but also the on-chip biosensors in general. It will also pave the way for the development of more sophisticated and functional sensor with higher throughput.\nAcknowledgement\nThis study was conducted in the frame of Newton Katip \u00c7elebi Fund between Turkey and UK and supported by Turkish Scientific and Technological Council TUBITAK) under the grant number of\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\n60 A cc ep t d M\nan\nus cr ip t\n13\n217S793.DC & EB acknowledge that this work was supported by a British Council Institutional Links grant, ID20180209 and delivered by the British Council.
