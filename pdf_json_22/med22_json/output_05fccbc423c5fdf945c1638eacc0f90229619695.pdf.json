            "text": "The DAMA/LIBRA collaboration has reported the observation of an annual modulation in the event rate that has been attributed to dark matter interactions over the last two decades. However, even though tremendous efforts to detect similar dark matter interactions were pursued, no definitive evidence has been observed to corroborate the DAMA/LIBRA signal. Many studies assuming various dark matter models have attempted to reconcile DAMA/LIBRA\u2019s modulation signals and null results from other experiments, however no clear conclusion can be drawn. Apart from the dark matter hypothesis, several studies have examined the possibility that the modulation is induced by variations in detector\u2019s environment or their specific analysis methods. In particular, a recent study presents a possible cause of the annual modulation from an analysis method adopted by the DAMA/LIBRA experiment in which the observed annual modulation could be reproduced by a slowly varying time\u2011 dependent background. Here, we study the COSINE\u2011100 data using an analysis method similar to the one adopted by the DAMA/LIBRA experiment and observe a significant annual modulation, however the modulation phase is almost opposite to that of the DAMA/LIBRA data. Assuming the same background composition for COSINE\u2011100 and DAMA/LIBRA, simulated experiments for the DAMA/ LIBRA without dark matter signals also provide significant annual modulation with an amplitude similar to DAMA/LIBRA with opposite phase. Even though this observation does not directly explain\nOPEN\n1Department of Physics and Wright Laboratory, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520, USA. 2Physics Institute, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo 05508-090, Brazil. 3Department of Physics and Astronomy, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea. 4Center for Underground Physics, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Daejeon 34126, Republic of Korea. 5Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Sheffield, Sheffield S3 7RH, UK. 6Department of Physics, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 06973, Republic of Korea. 7Department of Science Education, Ewha Womans University, Seoul 03760, Republic of Korea. 8Center for Exotic Nuclear Studies, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Daejeon 34126, Republic of Korea. 9IBS School, University of Science and Technology (UST), Daejeon 34113, Republic of Korea. 10Department of Physics and Wisconsin IceCube Particle Astrophysics Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53706, USA. 11Department of Physics, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Republic of Korea. 12Department of Physics, Sejong University, Seoul 05006, Republic of Korea. 13Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science, Daejeon 34113, Republic of Korea. 14Department of Accelerator Science, Korea University, Sejong 30019, Republic of Korea. 15Department of Physics, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Republic of Korea. 16Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA. 17Department of Physics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. *email: hyunsulee@ibs.re.kr; hafizhp@ibs.re.kr\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:4676 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31688-4\nthe DAMA/LIBRA results directly, this interesting phenomenon motivates more profound studies of the time\u2011dependent DAMA/LIBRA background data.\nSeveral groups have attempted to develop experiments aiming at reproducing or refuting DAMA/LIBRA\u2019s results using the same NaI(Tl) target material1\u20133. The COSINE-100 experiment4,5 is one of these that is currently operating with 106\u00a0kg of low-background NaI(Tl) crystals at the Yangyang underground laboratory (Y2L). Dark matter interpretations of the COSINE-100 data from the background spectra presented null observations6,7 that were inconsistent with an explanation of the DAMA/LIBRA signals as a spin-independent interaction between weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), the stringent candidate of the dark matter particle, and sodium or iodine nuclei in the specific context of the standard halo model. Model independent searches of the annual modulation were reported5,8 but with insufficient statistics to corroborate the DAMA/LIBRA observation yet. Another experiment currently in operation, ANAIS-112, also reported the model-independent annual modulation search results that exhibited more than 2 \u03c3 tension with DAMA/LIBRA\u2019s signals9 but has not yet made a conclusion. These model-independent searches considered time-dependent backgrounds based on the time-dependence of the rate induced by individual isotopes studied by cosmogenic activations10,11 and precise background modeling12\u201314. However, the DAMA/LIBRA experiment used the residual rate by subtracting an average rate in every one-year cycle of data-taking roughly starting in September15,16. If the background rate is not constant over time, this procedure can generate annually modulated event rates17,18. Specifically, a slowly increasing event rate as a function of the time in the region of interest (ROI) can provide an annual modulation similar to the one observed by DAMA/LIBRA without dark matter signals as studied in literature17. To verify this phenomenon, it is interesting to apply DAMA/LIBRA\u2019s analysis technique to other experimental data. Here we analyze the COSINE-100 data in terms of the annual modulation, but applying the analysis methods adopted by DAMA/LIBRA."

            "text": "Experiment. The COSINE-100 experiment4 started physics operation in September 2016 at Y2L in South Korea with about 700\u00a0m of rock overburden. It utilizes eight low-background NaI(Tl) crystals arranged in a 4 \u00d7 2 array, with a total target mass of 106\u00a0kg. Each crystal is coupled to two photomultiplier tubes\u00a0(PMTs) to measure the amount of energy deposited in the crystal. The NaI(Tl) detectors are immersed in a 2200\u00a0liter liquid scintillator, which allows for the identification and subsequent reduction of radioactive backgrounds observed by the crystal19. The liquid scintillator is surrounded by copper, lead, and plastic scintillators to reduce the background contribution from external radiation as well as tag cosmic-ray muons20,21.\nIn contrast with the COSINE-100 detector, DAMA/LIBRA does not employ plastic- or liquid scintillatorbased veto detectors. We, therefore, do not use information from those detectors in this analysis. In the ROI, PMT-induced noise events predominantly contribute to the single-hit physics data. They typically have fast decay times of less than 50\u00a0ns compared with typical NaI(Tl) scintillation of about 250\u00a0ns. The DAMA/LIBRA experiment developed a parameter to discriminate the PMT-induced noise by using a ratio of fast charge between 0 and 50\u00a0ns, X 1 , and slow charge between 100 and 600\u00a0ns, X 2 , each defined from relative to a time in the rising edge of PMT\u2019s waveform. The event selection (ES) parameter based on X 1 and X 2 provided good separation of the PMT-induced noise. DAMA/LIBRA claimed that they could efficiently remove the PMT-induced noise events by only using the ES parameter cut and achieve a 1\u00a0keV energy threshold with almost no noise contamination22. It should be noted that the 1\u00a0keV energy threshold from the COSINE-100 data was achieved by a multivariable machine learning technique (COSINE-100 nominal event selection) that used multiple parameters including, but not limited to X 1 and X 2 , mean decay time, charge asymmetry between two PMTs, and likelihood parameters for signal-like and noise-like templates7,23.\nWe found slightly different selection efficiencies when we applied exactly the same criteria used by the DAMA/ LIBRA for the ES parameter. Instead of the same value of the ES parameter cut, we choose values of the ES cut that result in a selection efficiency similar to the DAMA/LIBRA-phase222. We evaluate the selection efficiency with a 60 Co calibration dataset, which has been used for the COSINE-100 data analyses5\u20138, although DAMA/ LIBRA used 241 Am calibration data. Our selection criteria developed with the 60 Co calibration data and applied to the physics data are presented in Fig.\u00a01. The event selection efficiency compared with DAMA/LIBRA\u2019s efficiencies are shown in Fig.\u00a02.\nFigure\u00a03 shows energy spectra of the single-hit and the multiple-hit events using the ES parameter cut. These spectra are compared with those of the COSINE-100 nominal event selections. DAMA/LIBRA\u2019s event selection introduces an excess below 2\u00a0keV compared with the nominal COSINE-100 event selection. These events were categorized as PMT-induced noise in the nominal COSINE-100 event selection7,23. In the DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 energy spectrum, they also found a mild increase of the event rate below 2\u00a0 keV16, although these excess events were claimed as possible dark matter interactions22. However, the possibility of remnants from PMT-induced noise for excess events of the DAMA/LIBRA data are not fully excluded.\nBecause DAMA/LIBRA\u2019s analysis always used residual spectra of the event rate by subtracting average backgrounds for the modulation fit, we first model the time-dependent background. Here we use two different approaches to account for the time-dependent backgrounds. The first model uses an exponential function to describe the time-dependent background used for the initial annual modulation studies in COSINE-1005 and ANAIS-1122. The second model uses the yearly averaged rate in the DAMA/LIBRA experiment16.\nAfter subtracting the background, the residual rates are fitted with a sinusoidal function,\n3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:4676 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31688-4\nwhere R(t) is the residual event rate as a function of time, Sm is the modulation amplitude, t0 is a phase, and T is a period. In the typical dark matter interaction assuming the standard halo model, t0 and T are expected to be June 2nd , and 365.25\u00a0days (1\u00a0year), respectively.\nFigure\u00a04 shows 1\u20136\u00a0keV single-hit data and the time-dependent background model with the single-exponential model (a). The residual spectrum (c) is fitted with the sinusoidal function to obtain the modulation amplitude Sm = 0.0048 \u00b1 0.0055 counts/kg/keV/day. A similar procedure for the 2\u20136\u00a0keV single-hit events ((e) and (g)) obtains Sm = 0.0041 \u00b1 0.0056 counts/kg/keV/day. Even though the event selection only using the ES parameter contains significant PMT-induced noise events in the COSINE-100 data, the fitted results are consistent with no modulation when we model the time-dependent background using the single exponential function.\nThe same 1\u20136\u00a0keV single-hit data are modeled with the DAMA-like year average method (b). Considering the 13-year cycles of DAMA/LIBRA shown in Table\u00a01, we divide the COSINE-100 data into three-year cycles\n(1)R(t) = Smcos 2\u03c0(t \u2212 t0)\nT ,\nFigure\u00a01.

Here selection criteria shown in Fig.\u00a01 are determined to provide efficiencies similar to the DAMA/LIBRA-phase2.\n4 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:4676 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31688-4\npresented in Table\u00a02. The vertical lines in Fig.\u00a04b represent the start and end of each year cycle. The residual rates from this model are shown in Fig.\u00a04d with the annual modulation fit. Here we obtain a significant modulation amplitude Sm = \u2212 0.044 \u00b1 0.006\u00a0counts/kg/keV/day, which has about 7\u00a0\u03c3 significance. Similarly, in the 2\u20136\u00a0keV energy region ((f) and (h)), Sm = \u2212 0.046 \u00b1 0.006\u00a0counts/kg/keV/day is obtained. The negative sign of Sm indicates an opposite phase compared to that of DAMA/LIBRA and to the predicted phase from the WIMP dark matter model. Because the COSINE-100 data have time-dependent backgrounds from cosmogenically activated nuclides and 210Pb, event rates are clearly decreasing as a function of time. Simple yearly averages provide a bias on the modulation fit due to the mismodeling of the time-dependent background.\nMultiple-hit events in both 1\u20136\u00a0keV and 2\u20136\u00a0keV regions do not show significant modulation behaviors even though we apply the DAMA-like method in Fig.\u00a05). This is because the multiple-hit requirement removes the majority of radioisotopes that have high enough activities and short enough half-lives to affect the multi-hit event rate appreciably. Table\u00a03 summarizes the fit results for the single-hit 1\u20136, 2\u20136\u00a0keV events and comparisons of results from COSINE-100 (nominal analysis)8, ANAIS-1129, and DAMA/LIBRA16.\nFollowing up on the observation of the significant negative modulation of the COSINE-100 data using the DAMA-like method, we perform simulation studies about the DAMA/LIBRA\u2019s time-dependent background. Although the DAMA/LIBRA collaboration claimed no time-dependent background in their data22, a clear decrease of the event rate in the 2\u20136\u00a0keV range from DAMA/LIBRA-phase126 and DAMA/LIBRA-phase216 is observed, approximately from 1.2 to 0.7\u00a0counts/kg/keV/day. The major update from DAMA/LIBRA-phase1 to DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 was the replacement of PMTs from ET\u00a0(Electron tubes) Enterprises to Hamamatsu Photonics for the high quantum efficiency25 but using the same NaI(Tl) crystals. The observed decrease in backgrounds between phases is likely not due to the use of different PMTs, as there is a 10\u00a0cm quartz light guide between PMTs and crystals. Background contribution from the PMT\u2019s radioisotopes in the COSINE-100, which used PMTs from the Hamamatsu photonics, was less than 0.05\u00a0counts/kg/keV/day without the quartz block14. We also noted that similar radiopurities of Electron tubes were reported and Hamamatsu PMTs25.\nTherefore, one can suspect that the background rate decreasing between phase1 and phase2 was indeed due to decays of short-lived radioisotopes such as 3 H and 210 Pb that were reported by COSINE-10010,14 and ANAIS11211. In this simulation study, we assume that DAMA/LIBRA\u2019s crystals have the same background composition as crystal 6 of COSINE-100, which has the lowest background among the COSINE-100 crystals. The total average rate in the COSINE-100 crystal data is 2.5 times higher than the total DAMA/LIBRA rate averaged over phase1 and phase2. We scale each COSINE-100 crystal 6 background component by factor 1/2 to simulate the DAMA/ LIBRA data. After this scaling, the average rate of 2\u20136\u00a0keV single-hit events is 1.3\u00a0counts/kg/keV/day corresponds to the background rate at the beginning of the DAMA/LIBRA-phase1. Because the dominant backgrounds in this region from the COSINE-100 crystal are from 3 H and 210Pb, a decreased background rate is obtained, as shown in Fig.\u00a06. This background model plausibly describes the rate decrease from DAMA/LIBRA-phase1 to DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 (See Methods).\nSimulated data are generated from the aforementioned time-dependent background without the dark matter signals. Figure\u00a07a presents an example of the simulated data for 13-year cycles of the DAMA/LIBRA-like experiment. Vertical lines present the start and end of one year cycle used by DAMA/LIBRA (see Table\u00a01).

Here, selection efficiencies are corrected for proper comparison. Because we do not use the muon and LS detectors for the DAMA/LIBRA\u2019s event selection, the COSINE-100 nominal analysis obtains significantly larger numbers of multiple-hit events. Due to the remnants of the PMT-induced events from the DAMA/ LIBRA\u2019s event selection, a significant excess of the event rate below 2\u00a0keV in the single-hit events is observed.\n5 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:4676 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31688-4\nR at\ne\n3.6\n3.8\n4\n4.2 (a) Single-hit at 1-6 keV (b) Single-hit at 1-6 keV\nSept. 16 - Aug. 17 Sept. 17 - Aug. 18 Sept. 18 - Aug. 19 R es id ua l\n0.2\u2212\n0.1\u2212\n0\n0.1 0.2 (c) Residual rate at 1-6 keV (d) Residual rate at 1-6 keV R at e\n3\n3.2\n3.4\n3.6 (e) Single-hit at 2-6 keV\nSept. 16 - Aug. 17 Sept. 17 - Aug. 18 Sept. 18 - Aug. 19\n(f) Single-hit at 2-6 keV\n500 1000\nR es\nid ua\nl\n0.2\u2212\n0.1\u2212\n0\n0.1\n0.2 (g) Residual rate at 2-6 keV\n500 1000\n(h) Residual rate at 2-6 keV\n, 2016stDays from Jan. 1 , 2016stDays from Jan. 1\nFigure\u00a04.

            "text": "The direct detection of dark matter interactions is one of the main challenges of contemporary physics. Because of its significance, any hints of dark matter evidence need to be precisely examined. COSINE-100 continues to collect and analyze data to confirm or refute DAMA/LIBRA\u2019s hints at dark matter signals. Alternative explanations of the signals that do not involve dark matter, are investigated with the same NaI(Tl) target materials from the COSINE-100 experiment. We have observed PMT-induced noise contamination by adopting the selection criteria of DAMA/LIBRA. The time-dependent background model using a single exponential decay function provided no modulation from the COSINE-100 data, although significant PMT-induced noise in the low-energy signal region was observed. However, a DAMA-like yearly averaging method generates clear annual modulation signals because of the mismodeling of the time-dependent background. Furthermore, the DAMA-like method as applied to the simulated background-only data of DAMA/LIBRA, which are based on the time-dependent background in the COSINE-100 crystals, provides a consistent annual modulation signal of DAMA/LIBRA in the modulation amplitudes but a modulation phases that is almost opposite to that observed by DAMA/LIBRA. Although the observed phase is opposite, the consistent magnitude of the modulation amplitude may indicate an interesting phenomenon hidden in DAMA/LIBRA\u2019s background subtraction procedure."

The single-hit events correspond to any hit in a single NaI(Tl) crystal having no measurable energy in the other crystals. The multiple-hit events are defined in such a way that two or more NaI(Tl) crystals have measurable hits.\nIn the data acquisition of DAMA/LIBRA, PMT signals from the two ends of the crystal are digitized by a waveform analyzer for a time window of 2048\u00a0 ns24. In the data analysis, only a 600\u00a0ns time window integration of each pulse starting from the rising edge of each event was used to evaluate deposited energies.\nLow energies corresponding up to 100\u00a0keV energy region were calibrated with external sources of 241 Am (59.5\u00a0keV) and 133 Ba (30.4\u00a0keV and 81.0\u00a0keV) and with internal X-rays or \u03b3 s (3.2\u00a0keV, 40.4\u00a0keV, 67.3\u00a0keV etc). A linear fits for those points was used for the energy calibration24.

Results of 1000 simulated experiments for the DAMA/LIBRA experiment. We generate 1000 simulated experiments with a background derived from COSINE-100 with an exposure and analysis method derived from the DAMA/LIBRA experiment without the dark matter signals. (a) Results of the modulation amplitudes ( Sm ) using the phase-fixed fit are presented with DAMA/LIBRA\u2019s modulation amplitude. Although negative signs (opposite phase) are required, the simulated experiments obtain a modulation amplitude consistent with DAMA/LIBRA. Results for the phase-floated fits are shown for the modulation amplitude (b) and the modulation phase (c). Here we also observe consistent modulation amplitude but opposite phase by shifting the phase by \u03c0 between the simulated experiments and DAMA/LIBRA.\n9 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:4676 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31688-4\nobserved about 0.2\u00a0keV shift for the tagged 3.2\u00a0keV line and applied an additional correction in the low energy region between the software energy threshold and 15\u00a0 keV16.\nThe data acquisition system of the COSINE-100 experiment took waveforms of events for 8000\u00a0ns time windows4,27. Nominal analysis used a 5,000\u00a0ns time window starting from the rising edge of each event for the deposited energy. We used only internal X-rays or \u03b3 lines for the energy calibration to avoid position dependencies from external sources. The nonproportional scintillation behavior of the NaI(Tl) crystals studied in Ref.28 was applied for energy calibration in the low-energy region14. However, in this analysis, we follow the DAMA/ LIBRA\u2019s method as closely as possible. Integrated charge in a 600\u00a0ns time window is used for the deposited energy. A linear fit relating charge to energy is determined using the 59.5\u00a0keV from external 241 Am source and 3.2\u00a0keV from internal 40 K, providing an energy scale for the low-energy events.\nIn the low-energy signal region below 10\u00a0keV, PMT-induced noise events predominantly contribute to the single-hit physics data. The dominant noise has a fast decay time of less than 50\u00a0ns compared with typical NaI(Tl) scintillation of about 250\u00a0ns. The DAMA/LIBRA collaboration developed a good parameter based on ratios of slow ( X1 ) and fast ( X2 ) charges defined as following24,25,\nThe typical PMT-induced noise deposited most of the pulses in X2 while scintillation events of the NaI(Tl) crystals deposited about 70\u00a0% scintillation charge in the X1 area. For an effective rejection of PMT-induced noise events, DAMA/LIBRA defined an event selection (ES) parameter as follows,\nTypical signals have an ES parameter of around 0.8 while for the PMT-induced noise it is around 0.3, as one can see in Fig\u00a01. DAMA/LIBRA collected pure scintillation events using 59.5\u00a0keV \u03b3 rays from an 241 Am source. DAMA/LIBRA determined the selection criteria as ES greater than 0.72 (0.85) in the energy region of 1\u20133\u00a0keV (3\u20136\u00a0keV)24.\nInitially, we tried to use identical selection criteria for the COSINE-100 data, but the resulting selection efficiency was seen to differ significantly from that reported by DAMA/LIBRA24,25. This may be caused by slightly different scintillation characteristics of crystals due to different environmental conditions and different analysis methods used to determine the rising edge in the two experiments. Instead of the same ES parameter, we empirically develop cut criteria based on the selection efficiencies, making them similar between DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 and COSINE-100, as shown in Figs.\u00a01 and 2.\nBecause DAMA/LIBRA does not have the muon veto detectors, muon-related events are not directly removed. Therefore, we tag high-energy events in each crystal requiring energies above 4\u00a0MeV. After the high energy event, we remove a 1\u00a0s period of events in each crystal. In addition, data is monitored in two-hour periods which are occasionally removed when any large variation in the environmental or detector parameters are recorded.\nThe low-energy spectra from the COSINE-100 data using the aforementioned calibration and event selection are presented in Fig.\u00a03 and compared with the energy spectra from the nominal COSINE-100 data analysis14. Noticeably, we observe a significant increase of the event rate below 2\u00a0keV following DAMA/LIBRA\u2019s event selection method. Those excess events are categorized as PMT-induced noise events by the typical COSINE-100 data analysis.\nFitting procedure. We calculate the event rate for each NaI(Tl) detector binned in 15-day intervals. We then evaluate the detector livetime in each time bin and normalize the event rate based on its relative exposure. This process accounts for variations in exposure induced by both detector-off periods and data periods that are removed due to detector instability.\nAlthough time-dependent event rates were never presented by DAMA/LIBRA, they claimed no time-dependent backgrounds in their data22. The time dependence is reported for the residuals. The published DAMA/ LIBRA residuals were found by subtracting the time-averaged ROI event rate for each one-year cycle from the measured rate.\nThe DAMA/LIBRA cycles start every year around September, as summarized in Table\u00a0115,16,26. In addition to DAMA/LIBRA\u2019s method of the yearly averaged rate, we try to model the time-dependent background using a single exponential function to check the method bias.\nThe residual rates are fitted to the sinusoidal functions. The data from five detectors are fitted simultaneously. We perform the fit by minimizing the value of the computed \u03c72 , defined as\nwhere nij is the residual rate for ith crystal and jth time bin, and \u03c3ij is the corresponding uncertainty of the data. Rij is the expected modulation rate,\n(2)X1 = Charge (100 to 600 ns)/Charge (0 to 600 ns),\n(3)X2 = Charge (0 to 50 ns)/Charge (0 to 600 ns),\n(4)ES = 1\u2212 (X2 \u2212 X1)\n2 .\n(5)\u03c7 2 =\n\u2211\nij\n(nij \u2212 Rij) 2\n\u03c3 2ij ,\n10\nVol:.(1234567890)\nScientific Reports | (2023) 13:4676 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31688-4\nIn the phase-fixed fit, j0 is fixed to be 152 days with period T=365.25\u00a0days. A phase-floated fit with no constraints on j0 is also performed.\nTime dependent background in DAMA/LIBRA and COSINE\u2011100. DAMA/LIBRA has not explicitly reported their background in detail, although a few individual radioisotope contaminations were studied24. In a recent paper22, they presented the single-hit 1\u2013100\u00a0keV energy spectrum for the first time (Fig.\u00a020 in Ref.22). They described the data with 129 I, 40 K, and 210 Pb decays, with continuum (constant) background due to highenergy \u03b3/\u03b2 , and signals (possibly dark matter interactions). Here, 210 Pb can contribute to the time-dependent background due to its half-life of 22.3\u00a0years. In their modeling, 210 Pb contribution in the ROI is negligible, so an assumption of no time-dependent background seems to be legitimate, assuming the validity of this particular background model.\nIn the ROI, dominant background contributions are caused by internal 40 K and the continuum background. The continuum background may be caused by internal contamination of 238 U, 232 Th or external PMT radioactivities such as 238 U, 232Th, and 40 K. However, a precise modeling of the NaI(Tl) crystals performed by ANAIS-112 and COSINE-100 did not show a continuum background from such components13,14. Those backgrounds have decreasing rates in the low-energy region. In this case, other backgrounds with the potential to increase rates at low energy may need to be considered, examples are 3 H and 210 Pb in the crystal surface14,29. When considered, a time-dependent event rate that decreases in time is natural and similar to what is observed in ANAIS-1129 and COSINE-1008. It is worthwhile to mention that the background event rate in the 2\u20136\u00a0keV region in DAMA/ LIBRA has decreased from DAMA/LIBRA-phase1 to DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 as indicated in Fig.\u00a06.\nFor the simulated experiments of DAMA/LIBRA, we try to generate the time-dependent background describing DAMA/LIBRA\u2019s background behavior. Because there is no explicit description of time-dependent backgrounds from DAMA/LIBRA, we simply consider the same background components as the COSINE-100 crystals. The approximately 2.5 times lower background is scaled from the COSINE-100 background using the same fractional compositions of different background components. Short-lived radioisotopes with half-lives of less than 100\u00a0days were not included. Averaged rate of each time-dependent background component at the beginning of the experiment in the 2\u20136\u00a0keV region is summarized in Table\u00a04.\nFigure\u00a06 shows the model of the time-dependent background in the 2\u20136\u00a0keV region derived from the COSINE-100 data. Interestingly, this decreasing rate agrees with the change in average event rates between DAMA/LIBRA-phase1 and phase2. With this model, we generate simulated data and performed the fit for the year-subtracted residual rate as shown in Fig\u00a07."
