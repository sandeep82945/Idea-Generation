    "abstractText": "Abstract. We present a rigorous and precise analysis of the maximum degree and the average degree in a dynamic duplication-divergence graph model introduced by Sol\u00e9, Pastor-Satorras et al. in which the graph grows according to a duplication-divergence mechanism, i.e. by iteratively creating a copy of some node and then randomly alternating the neighborhood of a new node with probability p. This model captures the growth of some real-world processes e.g. biological or social networks. In this paper, we prove that for some 0 < p < 1 the maximum degree and the average degree of a duplication-divergence graph on t vertices are asymptotically concentrated with high probability around t and max{t, 1}, respectively, i.e. they are within at most a polylogarithmic factor from these values with probability at least 1\u2212 t for any constant A > 0.",

Introduction. Studying properties of random graphs is a popular topic of research in computer science and discrete mathematics since the seminal work of Paul Erdo\u030bs and Alfre\u0301d Re\u0301nyi [8]. This model was studied extensively using various probabilistic and analytic methods. The research mostly concentrated on a few broad topics: distribution of structural properties of graphs (e.g. the number of edges, degrees of fixed vertex, maximum degree, diameter), the existence of special subgraphs (e.g. motif counting, longest paths, maximum matching, Hamilton cycles), values of well-known combinatorial parameters (e.g. largest independent set, chromatic number), or extremal properties (Ramsey- and Tura\u0301n-type) \u2013 see e.g. surveys of results in [2, 10, 17, 31].\nThe widening array of application domains ranging from biology to finance to social science inspired further directions of research: first, there appeared an idea to bring the models to the real-world data and to study important aspects, such as centrality, degree correlation, community detection, or graph compression [19, 20, 24]. Second, more models of random networks were developed e.g. for inhomogeneous random graphs, geometric random graphs, preferential attachment graphs, or duplication graphs [4, 10, 31]. Often, these models were inspired by some generation mechanisms (e.g. rich-get-richer), or properties (e.g. scale-free/power-law property) that were\n\u2217Submitted to the editors DATE. The preliminary, partial, and weaker versions of these results appeared in WG 2020 [11] and COCOON 2021 [12] conference proceedings.\nFunding: This work was funded in part by NSF Center for Science of Information Grant CCF-0939370, and NSF Grants DMS1661063 and CCF-2006440.

In particular, since the late 1990s attention turned toward dynamics graphs in which the behavior of networks evolves in time, e.g. when sets of vertices and/or edges are functions of time, which is definitely the case for certain biological (e.g. protein-protein networks) and social networks (e.g. graph of citations).\nOne of the family of such networks is the so-called duplication models [5, 4]. It was observed that the evolutionary dynamics of protein interaction networks can be described by simple duplication and mutation rules [25, 32]. For example, the main mechanisms in such models are duplication and divergence: when vertices arrive one by one, they are created as copies of some already existing node, chosen uniformly at random (duplication), and then the neighborhood is typically altered randomly according to some predefined rules (divergence).\nIn this paper we study a particular duplication-divergence model, first introduced by Sole\u0301, Pastor-Satorras et al. [28]. This model is a promising object of inquiry since it has been shown empirically that its degree distribution, small subgraph (graphlets) counts, and the number of symmetries fit very well the structure of some real-world biological and social networks, e.g. protein-protein and citation networks. More precisely, there exist heuristics to infer the underlying parameters of the model from various biological networks, which enable us to generate similar graphs in terms of degree distributions, k-hop reachability, closeness, betweenness, and graphlet frequency [15, 22] (see also an alternative method of parameter estimation in [29]). It also turns out that this model often outperformed alternative ones in terms of systematically replicating the degree distribution, small subgraph (graphlets) counts, and symmetries of the input networks [6, 27, 29]. This suggests a possible real-world significance for the duplication-divergence model, which further motivates the studies of its structural properties.\nHowever, it is also one of the least understood models, much less so than the Erdo\u030bs-Re\u0301nyi or preferential attachment models. At the moment there exist only a handful of precise results related to the behavior of the degree distribution of the graphs generated by this model. Our contribution is a step towards closing this gap. In short, we prove an asymptotic tight concentration of two parameters in duplicationdivergence graphs: maximum degree, and average degree (or, equivalently, the number of edges) around their mean values.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we define formally the duplicationdivergence model, and we present an overview of the previous results related to the properties of the degree distribution. Then, in Section 3 we introduce our result for the maximum degree, with proof split into three parts: in Subsection 3.1 and Subsection 3.2 we prove upper bounds for the degrees of the earliest and later vertices arriving in the graph, respectively, and in Subsection 3.3 we give a proof of the lower bound for the degree of the first vertices, which is effectively also the lower degree of the maximum degree. Next, we proceed with Section 4, containing the proofs of the upper and the lower bounds for the average degree (or, equivalently, the total number of edges in the graph), respectively. Finally, we offer some further problems and hypotheses that stem from our current research.\nThis work is a substantial extension of two conference papers: the one presented at COCOON 2021 [12] which contained the weaker concentration results for maximum degree only for the case 12 < p < 1, and the one presented at WG 2020 [11] which contained the weaker claims (proved using different methods) for average degree and for degrees only of the earliest vertices.\n2. Model definition and earlier work. Throughout the paper we use standard graph notation from [7], e.g. V (G) denotes the vertex set of a graph G, degG(s) is the degree of node s in G, and we write \u2206(G) and D(G) for the maximum degree and the average degree in G. Let also NG(s) denote the open neighborhood of s in G. All graphs considered in the paper are simple, i.e. without loops or multiple edges.\nAdditionally, since we are eventually dealing with a probability space over graphs on t vertices, let Gt denote a random variable representing a graph on t vertices. Finally, since we are dealing with graphs growing sequentially, we assume that the vertices are identified with the natural numbers according to their arrival time. For simplicity, we introduce the notation degt(s) for the random variable denoting the degree of vertex s in Gt. Clearly, \u2206(Gt) and D(Gt) are random variables denoting the maximum degree and the average degree in Gt.\nLet us now formally define the duplication-divergence model, denoted DD(t, p, r), introduced by Sole\u0301 et al. [28, 26]. Let Gt0 be some graph on t0 \u2264 t vertices, with vertices having distinct labels from 1 to t0. Now, for every i = t0, t0 + 1, . . . , t\u2212 1 we create Gi+1 from Gi according to the following rules:\n1. we add a new vertex with label i+ 1 to the graph, 2. we choose a vertex u from Gi uniformly at random \u2013 and we denote u as\nparent(i+ 1), 3. for every vertex v:\n(a) if v is adjacent to u (v \u2208 NGi(u)) in Gi, then add an edge between v and i+ 1 with probability p, (b) if v is not adjacent to u in Gi (v /\u2208 NGi(u)), then add an edge between v and i + 1 with probability ri . Note that this case also occurs when v = u, since u /\u2208 NGi(u).\nAll edge additions are independent Bernoulli random variables.\nSince both p and ri for i = t0, . . . , t\u2212 1 are probabilities, we allow the parameter space to be p \u2208 [0, 1] and r \u2208 [0, t0].\nThere is indeed a duplication-divergence mechanism at work since we can think of the equivalent set of rules in the form \u201ccopy a vertex from Gi uniformly at random\u201d, \u201cremove its neighbors independently at random with probability 1 \u2212 p\u201d, and \u201cadd edges to all other vertices independently at random with probability ri \u201d.\nThroughout the paper we will refer to the standard Big-O Landau notation, as popularized e.g. in [13]. Let us recall its basic notion: f(n) = O(g(n)) for some functions f and g such that \u2203k>0\u2203n0\u2200n>n0 |f(n)| \u2264 |k \u00b7g(n)|. Additionally, we will use\n\u2022 f(n) = \u2126(g(n)) when g(n) = O(f(n)), \u2022 f(n) = \u0398(g(n)) when both f(n) = O(g(n)) and g(n) = O(f(n)), \u2022 f(n) = o(g(n)) when f(n) = O(g(n)) but not f(n) = O(g(n)).\nIntuitively, f(n) = \u2126(g(n)) when limn\u2192\u221e |f(n)| |g(n)| \u2208 [k1, k2] for some 0 < k1 < k2. Since in the model both p and r (and the order of initial graph Gt0) are constants, the asymptotic results are given exclusively in terms of t.\nAs it was mentioned earlier, there are only a few rigorous results for the DD(t, p, r) model and its special cases. For 0 < p < 1 and r = 0, it was proved in [14] that asymptotically there exists a phase transition for the limiting distribution of degree frequencies: if p \u2264 p\u2217, then almost all vertices are isolated, i.e. the number of nonisolated vertices in Gt is o(t), and if p > p\n\u2217, then only a constant fraction of vertices (with an explicit constant) are isolated. Moreover, it was proved that for any k the fraction of vertices of degree k in Gt converges to 0, and therefore there is no limiting degree distribution for p > p\u2217. From [21] it is known that the number of vertices of degree one in Gt is \u2126(log t) but again the precise rate of growth of the number of vertices with any fixed degree k > 0 is currently unknown.\nHowever, also for the same case in [18, 16] it was shown for p < exp(\u22121) that the (only) connected component in Gt exhibits a power-law property with the scale parameter \u03b3 which is the solution of 3 = \u03b3 + p\u03b3\u22122.\nFor the general case, the two main parameters under consideration were the degree of fixed vertices degt(s) and the average degree of Gt defined as\nD(Gt) = 1\nt\nt \u2211\ns=1\ndegt(s).\nIt was shown in [30] that we can solve the recurrence equation for the expected average degree and obtain\nTheorem 2.1. For t \u2192 \u221e it holds that\nE[D(Gt)] =\n\n \n \n\u0398(1) if p < 12 and r > 0, \u0398(ln t) if p = 12 and r > 0, \u0398(t2p\u22121) otherwise.\nIn a similar fashion it was shown that the expected degree of a vertex s is given by the following theorem:\nTheorem 2.2. For t \u2192 \u221e, it holds that\nE[degt(s)] =\n\n   \n   \n\u0398 ( log ( t s ))\nif p = 0 and r > 0,\n\u0398 (( t s )p) if 0 < p < 12 and r > 0, \u0398 (\u221a\nt s log s\n)\nif p = 12 and r > 0,\n\u0398 (( t s )p s2p\u22121 ) otherwise.\nClearly, the latter result for the earliest vertices implies that the expected maximum degree is \u2126(tp) for all 0 < p < 1.\nIn fact, in [30] the authors obtained more than just Theorem 2.1 and Theorem 2.2, because they derived the exact formulae for both E[D(Gt)] and E[degt(s)] with their very convoluted leading coefficients (depending on s, p, r) together with the asymptotics for Var[D(Gt)] and Var[degt(s)].\nThe natural question then is to show that these random variables are concentrated, i.e. whether by moving only some small (e.g. polylogarithmic) factor from the mean we could observe the polynomial tail decay. Intuitively, for the later vertices we should not expect such a phenomenon: since the parent of a new vertex is drawn uniformly, and there are two binomial processes on top of it, we expect the degree distribution of degt(t) rather reflect the whole degree distribution, which for some cases we know (and for all other we stipulate, based on simulations) is not concentrated. However, as we will see in the next sections for the maximum degree and the average degree we can answer this question in the affirmative.\n3. Maximum degree. In this section we present our main result concerning the concentration of the maximum degree \u2206(Gt). We formulate it in the next theorem.\nTheorem 3.1. Let 0 < p < 1. Asymptotically for Gt \u223c DD(t, p, r)\nPr[(1\u2212 \u03b1)tp \u2264 \u2206(Gt) \u2264 (1 + \u03b1)t p log2\u2212p\n2\n(t)] = 1\u2212O(t\u2212A)\nfor any constants \u03b1 > 0 and A > 0.\nWe prove separately a lower bound and a matching (within a polylogarithmic factor) upper bound. The main idea of the upper bound proof, presented in the next subsection, is as follows: we first in Definition 3.2 introduce auxiliary deterministic sequences (ti) k i=0 and (Xti) k i=0 such that t0 < . . . < tk\u22121 < t \u2264 tk. Although at first glance the dependency between (ti) k i=0 and (Xti) k i=0 given in this definition could seem very convoluted, the intuition behind it is very simple: by doing this we can prove with little effort that Xti grows close to t p i , provided that we choose the right parameters. Indeed, we show that Xt \u2264 (1 + \u03b1)t p log2\u2212p 2\n(t) for any constant \u03b1 > 0. This way, we want (Xti) k i=0 to be a good (i.e. holding with high probability) upper bound for degti(s) for all i = 0, . . . , k and all s \u2264 t0 (denoted as early vertices), which in turn should give us a similar lower bound degt(s) in terms of Xt whp. We proceed in two major steps: first, by construction, we have degt0(s) \u2264 t0 = Xt0 , and second, we prove a bound on degti+1(s)\u2212degti(s) that ensures it does not exceed Xti+1 \u2212Xti with high probability. The latter part is achieved by providing an adequate upper bounding of degti+1(s)\u2212 degti(s) by a sum of independent Bernoulli variables, so the Chernoff bound can be employed \u2013 and by applying a telescoping sum we establish that degt(s) \u2264 Xt with high probability for all s \u2264 t0. Therefore, we find for early vertices s (i.e. s \u2264 t0) a Chernoff-type bound on the growth of deg\u03c4 (s) over an interval of certain length h.\nThe second part of the proof of our upper bound on the maximum degree is inductive: we prove that with high probability for any vertex s \u2208 (ti, ti+1] it holds that degt(s) \u2264 max\u03c4\u2264ti{degt(\u03c4)}, that is, the later vertices (that is, for any s > t0) can have maximum degree only with a negligible probability. This proof can also be decomposed into three steps: first, we show that a vertex s on its arrival cannot have a degree greater than (1+\u03b5)(pXt+r) with high probability, and then it cannot increase between time s and ti+1 to exceed Xti+1 . Finally, to proceed from degti+1(s) \u2264 Xti+1 whp to degt(s) \u2264 Xt whp we use exactly the same Chernoff bound as for early vertices.\nTo prove the lower bound we follow the steps from the upper bound for the early vertices: we show a respective lower Chernoff-type bound on the growth of deg\u03c4 (s) over an interval of certain length h and we combine it with different (but very similar) sequences ti and Xti , thus proving that in this case deg\u03c4 (s) \u2265 X\u03c4 \u2212 ln\n1+p(\u03c4)+ 1 with high probability for all early vertices (that is, s \u2264 t0), and that Xt \u2265 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)t\np for any \u03b1 > 0.\nNote that the asymmetry between the proofs of both bounds stems from the fact that for the lower bound we only needed to find an inequality that holds with high probability for a single vertex, whereas for the upper bound we had to prove an inequality that holds with high probability for all vertices s = 1, . . . , t.\n3.1. Upper bound, early vertices (s \u2264 t0). We begin with the definitions for two auxiliary sequences that we mentioned earlier:\nDefinition 3.2. For any t and the given coefficients \u03c6(t), (\u03b2i(t)) k\u22121 i=0 and the\nsequence of positive jumps (wi(t)) k\u22121 i=0 we define the sequences (ti) k i=0 and (Xti) k i=0 and a number k(t) \u2208 N, also implicitly dependent on t as follows:\nt0 = \u03c6(t), ti+1 = ti + wi(t),\nXt0 = t0, Xti+1 = Xti + \u03b2i(t) wi(t)Xti\nti ,\nk is such that tk\u22121 < t \u2264 tk.\nMoreover, to prove the desired bounds it would be ultimately necessary that \u03c6(t) and all wi(t) tend to infinity with t. For brevity, from now on we assume the dependency on t as implicit and write \u03c6, \u03b2i, and wi instead of \u03c6(t), \u03b2i(t), wi(t), respectively.\nNote that inductively from the definition it follows that if \u03b2i \u2264 1, then Xti \u2264 ti for all i = 0, 1, . . . , k.\nMoreover, observe that we do not need to specify the values of X\u03c4 for \u03c4 other than {t0, t1, . . . , tk}. In the rest of the paper we will be using precisely these values in the proofs, so such a definition is sufficient for our purposes. For reader\u2019s convenience we shall assume that for any \u03c4 \u2208 (tl, tl+1) for some l = 0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1 the sequence is completed in any way such that Xtl \u2264 X\u03c4 \u2264 Xtl+1 .\nNow we analyze the asymptotic properties of these sequences. We start with a simple lower bound:\nLemma 3.3. Assume \u03b2i \u2265 p\u2212 p(1\u2212p) 4 ln ti and wi \u2264 ti ln ti . For t \u2192 \u221e we have Xti \u2265 t p i\nfor all i = 0, 1, . . . , k.\nProof. Let us define Y\u03c4 = \u03c4 p. By definition we know that Xt0 = t0 \u2265 Yt0 . Now,\nlet us assume that Xti \u2265 Yti holds for some i \u2265 0. Then we have\nYti+1 \u2212 Yti = ((ti + wi) p \u2212 tpi ) = t p i\n((\n1 + wi ti\n)p\n\u2212 1\n)\n\u2264 tpi\n(\npwi ti \u2212 p(1\u2212 p)w2i 4t2i\n)\n\u2264 tpi wi ti\n(\np\u2212 p(1\u2212 p)\n4 ln ti\n)\n.\nsince from Taylor expansion it follows that (1 + x)p \u2264 1 + px \u2212 p(1\u2212p)x 2\n4 for any p \u2208 [0, 1] and any x \u2208 (0, 1). Therefore,\nYti+1 \u2212 Yti \u2264 Yti wi ti\n(\np\u2212 p(1\u2212 p)\n4 ln ti\n)\n\u2264 Xti \u03b2iwi ti = Xti+1 \u2212Xti ,\nso clearly Xti+1 \u2265 Yti+1 holds as well, which completes the inductive step.\nNow we prove an upper bound on Xt. Lemma 3.4. Assume that \u03c6 \u2265 ln t, \u03b2i \u2264 p + 1\n2 ln ti and wi \u2264 ti ln ti . It holds\nasymptotically as t \u2192 \u221e that Xti \u2264 \u03c6 1\u2212ptpi ln ti for all i = 0, 1, . . . , k.\nProof. We again proceed by induction with Y\u03c4 = \u03c6 1\u2212p\u03c4p ln \u03c4 . Clearly, Xt0 = t0 \u2264\nYt0 = t0 ln t0. Directly from the definition we get\nYti+1 \u2212Xti+1 = Yti+1 \u2212Xti\n(\n1 + \u03b2iwi ti\n)\n\u2265 \u03c61\u2212ptpi+1 ln ti+1 \u2212 \u03c6 1\u2212ptpi ln ti\n(\n1 + \u03b2iwi ti\n)\n\u2265 \u03c61\u2212ptpi ln ti\n((\nti+1 ti )p ( ln ti+1 ln ti ) \u2212 1\u2212 \u03b2iwi ti )\n= \u03c61\u2212ptpi ln ti\n((\n1 + wi ti\n)p(\n1 + ln(1 + wi/ti)\nln ti\n)\n\u2212 1\u2212 \u03b2iwi ti\n)\n.\nNow we use the inequalities derived from the respective Taylor expansions: (1 +\nx)p \u2265 1 + px \u2212 p(1\u2212p)x 2 2 \u2265 1 and ln(1 + x) \u2265 x \u2212 x2\n2 \u2265 0, true for any p \u2208 [0, 1] and any x \u2208 (0, 1). In particular, in our case x = witi \u2264 1 ln ti \u2264 1ln ln t = o(1). Therefore\nYti+1 \u2212Xti+1 \u2265 \u03c6 1\u2212ptpi ln ti\n(\n(p\u2212 \u03b2i)wi ti +\n(\n1 + pwi ti\n)(\nwi ti ln ti \u2212 w2i 2t2i ln ti\n)\n\u2212 p(1\u2212 p)w2i\n2t2i\n(\n1 + wi\nti ln ti \u2212 w2i 2t2i ln ti\n)\n)\n\u2265 \u03c61\u2212ptp\u22121i ln ti \u00b7 wi\n(\n\u2212 1\n2 ln ti +\n1\nln ti \u2212 wi 8ti\n(\n1 + wi\nti ln ti \u2212 w2i 2t2i ln ti\n)\n)\n\u2265 \u03c61\u2212ptp\u22121i \u00b7 wi\n(\n3 8 \u2212 1\n8 ln ti\n(\nwi ti \u2212 w2i 2t2i\n))\n,\nand for sufficiently large t the last expression is clearly non-negative since witi \u2264 1 ln ti \u2264\n1 ln t0 \u2264 1ln\u03c6 \u2264 1 ln ln t \u2192 0, which completes the proof.\nNext, we need some bounds on deg\u03c4 (s) holding with high probability to match with the sequence X\u03c4 . Let us begin with the following estimate:\nLemma 3.5. For any \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 t and any 0 \u2264 d \u2264 h it is true that\nPr [ deg\u03c4+h(s)\u2212 deg\u03c4 (s) \u2265 d | deg\u03c4 (s) ] \u2264 exp\n(\nd ln exp(1) \u00b7 h(p deg\u03c4 (s) + pd+ r)\nd\u03c4\n)\n.\nProof. First, it follows from the definition of the model that deg\u03c4+i+1(s) = deg\u03c4+i(s) + I\u03c4+i for i = 0, 1, . . . , h\u2212 1 where I\u03c4+i \u223c Be(q\u03c4+i) for some q\u03c4+i \u2208 [0, 1]. The probability q\u03c4+i of adding an edge between s and \u03c4 + i + 1 is just a sum of probabilities of two events:\n1. when parent(\u03c4 + i+ 1) \u2208 NG\u03c4+i(s) holds, i.e. with probability deg\u03c4+i(s)\n\u03c4+i (since we draw the parent uniformly), we add an edge with probability p \u2013 so the whole event has probability pdeg\u03c4+i(s)\n\u03c4+i ,\n2. when parent(\u03c4 + i+ 1) /\u2208 NG\u03c4+i(s) holds, i.e. with probability 1 \u2212 deg\u03c4+i(s)\n\u03c4+i , we add an edge with probability r\u03c4+i \u2013 so the whole event has probability\nr \u03c4+i\n(\n1\u2212 deg\u03c4+i(s)\n\u03c4+i\n)\n.\nBoth events are disjoint, so we obtain q\u03c4+i = p deg\u03c4+i(s)+r \u03c4+i \u2212 r deg\u03c4+i(s) (\u03c4+i)2 \u2264 p deg\u03c4+i(s)+r \u03c4+i .\nNext, we note that the degree grows by at least d if there is a subsequence of d successes i1, i2, . . . , id with only failures between them:\nPr [ deg\u03c4+h(s)\u2212 deg\u03c4 (s) \u2265 d | deg\u03c4 (s) ]\n= \u2211\n0\u2264i1<...<id<h\nPr\n\n\n\u22c3\nj\u2208{i1,...,id}\nI\u03c4+j \u222a \u22c3\nj\u2208[0,id]\\{i1,...,id}\n\u00acI\u03c4+j\n\n\n= \u2211\n0\u2264i1<...<id<h\n\u220f\nj\u2208{i1,...,id}\nPr[I\u03c4+j | deg\u03c4+j(s)] \u220f\nj\u2208[0,id]\\{i1,...,id}\nPr[\u00acI\u03c4+j | deg\u03c4+j(s)].\nNow observe that Pr[\u00acI\u03c4+j | deg\u03c4+j(s)] \u2264 1 for any j and Pr[I\u03c4+ij | deg\u03c4+ij (s)] \u2264 p(deg\u03c4 (s)+j\u22121)+r\n\u03c4+ij for j = 1, 2, . . . , d since j-th success occurs after exactly j \u2212 1 suc-\ncesses, i.e. when the degree of the vertex s is exactly equal to deg\u03c4 (s) + j \u2212 1. Thus\nPr [ deg\u03c4+h(s)\u2212 deg\u03c4 (s) \u2265 d | deg\u03c4 (s) ] \u2264 \u2211\n0\u2264i1<...<id<h\nd \u220f\nj=1\np(deg\u03c4 (s) + j \u2212 1) + r\n\u03c4 + ij\n\u2264\n(\nh\nd\n)\nmax 0\u2264i1<...<id<h\n\n\n\nd \u220f\nj=1\np(deg\u03c4 (s) + j \u2212 1) + r\n\u03c4 + ij\n\n\n\n.\nOne can easily spot that the maximum occurs in the case when ij = j \u2212 1 for all j = 1, 2, . . . , d. This, coupled with a simple upper bound on the value of the binomial coefficient, leads us to the final result\nPr [ deg\u03c4+h(s)\u2212 deg\u03c4 (s) \u2265 d | deg\u03c4 (s) ]\n\u2264 hd exp(d)\ndd\nd\u22121 \u220f\nj=0\np(deg\u03c4 (s) + j) + r\n\u03c4 + j\n\u2264 exp\n(\nd lnh\u2212 d ln d+ d+ d ln p(deg\u03c4 (s) + d) + r\n\u03c4\n)\n\u2264 exp\n(\nd ln exp(1) \u00b7 h(p deg\u03c4 (s) + pd+ r)\nd\u03c4\n)\n.\nThis lemma gives a far better bound than the simple estimation deg\u03c4+h(s) \u2264 deg\u03c4 (s)+ h (e.g. used in [12]). However, it is still too coarse to obtain a desired upper bound that could be coupled with the sequence X\u03c4 . But we can still use it to kickstart the Chernoff bound by bounding the probabilities of all Bernoulli variables:\nLemma 3.6. For ln1+p t \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 t, \u03b5 = 15 ln \u03c4 with h \u2264 \u03b5\u03c4 p(1+2\u03b5) exp(2) it holds for any\nconstant A > 0 that\nPr\n[\nmax j=0,...,h\u22121\n{\np deg\u03c4+j(s) + r\n\u03c4 + j\n}\n\u2265 (1 + \u03b5) pX\u03c4 + r\n\u03c4\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 deg\u03c4 (s) \u2264 X\u03c4 ] = O(t\u2212A).\nProof.

In the fourth line we applied inequality r \u2264 p\u03b5X\u03c4 . Moreover, in the last line we used the facts that X\u03c4 \u2265 max{\u03c6, \u03c4\np} and max{a, b} \u2265 a\u03b3b1\u2212\u03b3 for any a, b > 0 and \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 1].\nTo complete the proof it is sufficient to use a union bound over all values up to h = O(t).\nLet us now proceed with providing a Chernoff-type bound on the growth of the degree of a given early vertex:\nLemma 3.7. Let 1 \u2264 s \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 t such that \u03c4 \u2265 \u03c6 = ln1+p t. Then for any A > 0 it is true that\nPr\n[\ndeg\u03c4+h(s)\u2212 deg\u03c4 (s) \u2265 3A(1 + \u03b4)\n\u03b42 ln t\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 deg\u03c4 (s) \u2264 X\u03c4 ] = O(t\u2212A),\nwith \u03b5 = \u03b4 = 15 ln \u03c4 , and h = 3A\u03c4 ln t \u03b42(1+\u03b5)(pX\u03c4+r) .\nProof. Let us first define an event\nD\u03b5(\u03c4, h) =\n[\nmax j=0,...,h\u22121\n{\np deg\u03c4+j(s) + r\n\u03c4 + j\n}\n\u2265 (1 + \u03b5) pX\u03c4 + r\n\u03c4\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 deg\u03c4 (s) \u2264 X\u03c4 ] .\nClearly,\nPr [ deg\u03c4+h(s)\u2212 deg\u03c4 (s) \u2265 d | deg\u03c4 (s) \u2264 X\u03c4 ]\n\u2264 Pr [ deg\u03c4+h(s)\u2212 deg\u03c4 (s) \u2265 d | deg\u03c4 (s) \u2264 X\u03c4 ,\u00acD\u03b5(\u03c4, h) ] + Pr[D\u03b5(\u03c4, h)],\nLet us estimate the probability of the second event. If h = 3A\u03c4 ln t\u03b42(1+\u03b5)(pX\u03c4+r) and\n\u03b5 = 15 ln \u03c4 , then the condition h \u2264 \u03b5\u03c4 p(1+\u03b5) exp(2) ln \u03c4 is met since for some constant C > 0 we have\nh \u2264 C\u03c4 ln t\n\u03b42X\u03c4 =\nC\u03c4 ln t \u00b7 25 ln2 \u03c4\nmax{ln1+p t, \u03c4p} =\nC\u03c4 ln t \u00b7 25 ln2 \u03c4\nln t \u00b7 \u03c4p2/(1+p) \u2264\n\u03c4\nln2 \u03c4\n\u2264 \u03c4\np \u00b7 2 exp(2) \u00b7 5 ln \u03c4 \u2264\n\u03b5\u03c4\np(1 + \u03b5) exp(2) ln \u03c4\nand from Lemma 3.6 we obtain that Pr[D\u03b5(\u03c4, h)] = O(t \u2212A). Here we again used the facts that X\u03c4 \u2265 max{\u03c6, \u03c4 p} and max{a, b} \u2265 a\u03b3b1\u2212\u03b3 for any a, b > 0 and \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 1].\nThus, it is sufficient to bound deg\u03c4+h(s) \u2212 deg\u03c4 (s) with high probability when D\u03b5(\u03c4, h) does not hold, that is, when for all i = 1, . . . , h it is true that\ndeg\u03c4+i(s)\n\u03c4 + i < (1 + \u03b5) X\u03c4 \u03c4 .\nIt follows that I\u03c4+i = deg\u03c4+i+1(s) \u2212 deg\u03c4+i(s) is stochastically dominated by independent random variables I\u2217\u03c4+i \u223c Be ( (1 + \u03b5)pX\u03c4+r\u03c4 ) for any i = 0, 1, . . . , h \u2212 1 \u2013 since in the case of Bernoulli variables Be(p1) is stochastically dominated by Be(p2) whenever p1 \u2264 p2. This way we can eliminate dependencies \u2013 the outcome of each I\u03c4 influences the distributions for I\u03c4 \u2032 , \u03c4\n\u2032 > \u03c4 \u2013 and work with independent variables I\u2217\u03c4+i.\nNow, since the new variables are both Bernoulli and independent, we can use the well-known left tail Chernoff bound for binomial setting from [10] (see Corollary 21.7) which states that for any \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1)\nPr\n[\nh\u22121 \u2211\ni=0\nI\u2217\u03c4+i \u2265 (1 + \u03b4)E\n[\nh\u22121 \u2211\ni=0\nI\u2217\u03c4+i\n]]\n\u2264 exp\n(\n\u2212 \u03b42\n3 E\n[\nh\u22121 \u2211\ni=0\nI\u2217\u03c4+i\n])\nand therefore\nPr\n[\ndeg\u03c4+h(s)\u2212 deg\u03c4 (s) \u2265 (1 + \u03b4)(1 + \u03b5) h(pX\u03c4 + r)\n\u03c4\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 deg\u03c4 (s) \u2264 X\u03c4 ,\u00acD\u03b5(\u03c4, h) ]\n\u2264 exp\n(\n\u2212 h\u03b42(1 + \u03b5)(pX\u03c4 + r)\n3\u03c4\n)\n.\nTo finish the proof it is sufficient to see that h = 3A\u03c4 ln t\u03b42(1+\u03b5)(pX\u03c4+r) gives the required\nO(t\u2212A) bound in the last equation.\nFinally, we proceed with the proof of the main result of this section.\nTheorem 3.8. For Gt \u223c DD(t, p, r) with 0 < p < 1 and s \u2208 [1, ln 1+p t] it holds\nasymptotically that\nPr [\ndegt(s) \u2265 (1 + \u03b1) t p ln2\u2212p\n2 t ] = O(t\u2212A)\nfor any constants \u03b1 > 0 and A > 0.\nProof. Throughout the proof we will use sequences (ti) k i=0 and (Xti) k i=0 with\n\u03c6 = ln1+p t, \u03b2i = p+ 1\n2 ln ti , wi = 3(A+1)ti ln t \u03b42(1+\u03b5)(pXti+r) , and \u03b5 = \u03b4 = 15 ln ti .\nObserve that all the assumptions of Lemma 3.3 and Lemma 3.4 are met, i.e.\np \u2264 \u03b2i \u2264 p+ 1\n2 ln ti and wi \u2264 ti ln ti , so we know that max{ln1+p t, tpi } \u2264 Xti \u2264 t p i ln 2\u2212p2 t for all i = 0, 1, . . . , k.\nNow let us define events Ai(s) = [degti(s) < Xti ] for i = 0, . . . , k. Clearly, A0(s) holds since by definition of Xt0 we have degt0(s) < t0 = Xt0 .\nSuppose that Ai(s) holds. Then we can apply Lemma 3.7 with \u03c4 = ti and h = wi:\nPr[\u00acAi+1(s)|Ai(s)] = Pr[degti+1(s) \u2265 Xti+1 | degti(s) < Xti ]\n\u2264 Pr[degti+1(s)\u2212 degti(s) \u2265 Xti+1 \u2212Xti | degti(s) < Xti ]\n= Pr\n[\ndegti+1(s)\u2212 degti(s) \u2265 \u03b2i wiXti ti\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 degti(s) < Xti\n]\n= Pr\n[\ndegti+1(s)\u2212 degti(s) \u2265 \u03b2iXti\n(1 + \u03b5)(pXti + r)\n3(A+ 1)\n\u03b42 ln t\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 degti(s) < Xti ]\n\u2264 Pr\n[\ndegti+1(s)\u2212 degti(s) \u2265 3(A+ 1)(1 + \u03b4)\n\u03b42 ln t\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 degti(s) < Xti ] = O(t\u2212A\u22121),\nwhere we used the fact that asymptotically as t \u2192 \u221e\n\u03b2iXti (1 + \u03b4)(1 + \u03b5)(pXti + r) = \u03b2iXti\nXti\n( p+ \u03b4 (\np+ p\u03b5+ r(1+\u03b5)Xti\n) + \u03b5 (\np+ rXti\n))\n+ r\n\u2265 \u03b2i\np+ \u03b4 (\np+ p\u03b5+ r(1+\u03b5)Xti\n) + \u03b5 (\np+ p\u03b5+ r(1+\u03b5)Xti\n)\n+ rXti\n\u2265 p+ 12 ln ti\np+ \u03b4 + \u03b5+ rXti\n\u2265 1,\nwhere in the denominator of the first inequality we used the facts that p + rXti \u2264 p+ p\u03b5+ r(1+\u03b5)Xti = p+ o(1) \u2264 1 for any constants 0 < p < 1, 0 \u2264 r \u2264 t0 when t \u2192 \u221e.\nNext, we get\nPr[degt(s) \u2265 Xtk ] \u2264 Pr[degtk(s) \u2265 Xtk ] = Pr[\u00acAk(s)]\n\u2264\nk\u22121 \u2211\ni=0\nPr[\u00acAi+1(s)|Ai(s)] + Pr[\u00acA0(s)] =\nk\u22121 \u2211\ni=0\nO(t\u2212A\u22121) = O(t\u2212A),\nsince asymptotically it is true that wi \u2265 1 for all i = 0, . . . , k, and therefore k \u2264 t. To complete the proof it is sufficient to note that tk = tk\u22121(1+\u03b1) \u2264 (1+\u03b1)t and thus Xtk \u2264 (1 + \u03b1)t p ln2\u2212p 2 t for any constant \u03b1 > 0.\n3.2. Upper bound, late vertices (s > t0). In the second part of the proof we also use the sequences (ti) k i=0 and (Xti) k i=0 as defined in Definition 3.2. Moreover, throughout this section we use the same constants as in the proof of Theorem 3.8: \u03c6 = ln1+p t, \u03b2i = p+ 1\n2 ln ti and wi = 3(A+1)ti ln t \u03b42(1+\u03b5)(pXti+r) .\nThe proof consists of showing that for s \u2208 [ti, ti+1) for some i = 0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1 the degree graph (i.e. degs(s)) is with high probability significantly smaller than its corresponding Xti+1 . Furthermore, we show that the increase in the degree between degs(s) and degti+1(s) with high probability cannot compensate for this difference.\nThus, Xt (or, to be more precise, Xtk) gives us a good upper bound on degt(s) for all s \u2013 and therefore also we obtain an upper bound for \u2206(Gt).\nLet us introduce auxiliary events Bl(s) = \u22c3s\n\u03c4=1Al(\u03c4) = [degtl(\u03c4) \u2264 Xtl for all \u03c4 \u2264 s \u2264 tl] where Ai(s) is, as before, the event that degti(s) \u2264 Xti for a fixed s \u2264 ti.\nLemma 3.9. Let s \u2208 (tl, tl+1] for some l = 0, 1, . . . , k\u22121. Then, for any constants \u03b5 > 0 and A > 0\nPr [ degs(s) \u2265 (1 + \u03b5)(pXtl+1 + r) |Bl(tl) \u2227 Bl+1(s\u2212 1) ] = O(t\u2212A).\nProof. First, we notice the fact that max{degtl+1(\u03c4) : 1 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 s \u2212 1} \u2264 Xtl+1 guarantees that max{degs(\u03c4) : 1 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 s\u2212 1} \u2264 Xtl+1 . Therefore, degs(s) is stochastically dominated by As \u223c Bin(Xtl+1 , p)+Bin(s\u2212 1, r s\u22121 ) and we directly obtain the result using the Chernoff bound with E[As] = pXtl+1 + r:\nPr [ degs(s) \u2265 (1 + \u03b5)(pXtl+1 + r) \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 Bl(tl) \u2227 Bl+1(s\u2212 1) ]\n\u2264 exp\n(\n\u2212 \u03b52\n\u03b5+ 2 (pXtl+1 + r)\n)\n\u2264 t\u2212A,\nasymptotically for any constants \u03b5, A > 0 since Xtl+1 \u2265 ln 1+p t.\nNote that the result implies that with high probability at most slightly more than a p fraction of the maximum degree is already present at time s. Therefore, we are interested in bounding the remaining part of the degree, i.e. degtl+1(s)\u2212 degs(s), by something smaller than the remaining fraction of the maximum degree.\nLemma 3.10. Let s \u2208 (tl, tl+1] for some l = 0, 1, . . . , k\u22121. Then, for any constant \u03b1 > 0 and A > 0\nPr [ degtl+1(s)\u2212 degs(s) \u2265 \u03b1Xtl+1 |Bl(tl) \u2227 Bl+1(s\u2212 1) ] = O(t\u2212A).\nProof. We use Lemma 3.5 with d = \u03b1Xtl+1 to obtain asymptotically as t \u2192 \u221e that for any A > 0 it holds that\nPr [ degtl+1(s)\u2212 degs(s) \u2265 \u03b1Xtl+1 |Bl(tl) \u2227 Bl+1(s\u2212 1) ]\n= Pr [\ndegtl+1(s)\u2212 degs(s) \u2265 \u03b1Xtl+1\n]\n\u2264 Pr [ degs+wl(s)\u2212 degs(s) \u2265 \u03b1Xtl+1 ]\n\u2264 exp\n(\n\u03b1Xtl+1 ln exp(1) \u00b7 wlp(1 + 2\u03b1)Xtl+1\n\u03b1Xtl+1 \u00b7 s\n)\n\u2264 exp\n(\n\u03b1Xtl+1\n(\nexp(1) \u00b7 (1 + 2\u03b1) \u00b7 3(A+ 1)\n\u03b1(1 + \u03b1) + ln\nln t\n\u03b42(Xtl + r/p)\n))\n\u2264 exp\n(\n\u03b1Xtl+1\n(\n\u0398(1) + ln 25 ln t \u00b7 ln2 tl\nmax{ln1+p t, tpl }\n))\n\u2264 exp\n(\n\u03b1 ln1+p t\n(\n\u0398(1) + ln 25 ln2 tl\nt p2/(1+p) l\n))\n\u2264 exp(\u2212A ln t) \u2264 t\u2212A\nas needed.\nTo proceed we need the following two lemmas.\nLemma 3.11. Let s \u2208 (tl, tl+1] for some l = 0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1. Then asymptotically as t \u2192 \u221e, for any constant A > 0 it holds that\nPr [ degtl+1(s) \u2265 Xtl+1 |Bl(tl) \u2227 Bl+1(s\u2212 1) ] = O(t\u2212A).\nProof.

Let s \u2208 (tl, tl+1] for some l = 0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1. Then asymptotically as t \u2192 \u221e, for any constant A > 0 it holds that\nPr [\u00acBl+1(tl+1)|Bl(tl)] = O(t \u2212A).\nProof. Let l be the first value for which the lemma does not hold. Then, from Lemma 3.11 we get that for any constant A > 0 it holds that\nPr [\u00acBl+1(tl+1)|Bl(tl) \u2227 Bl+1(tl)] =\ntl+1\u22121 \u2211\ns=tl\nPr[\u00acBl+1(s+ 1)|Bl(tl) \u2227 Bl+1(s)]\n=\ntl+1\u22121 \u2211\ns=tl\nPr[\u00acAl+1(s+ 1)|Bl(tl) \u2227 Bl+1(s)] = O(t \u2212A).\nFrom Theorem 3.8 we know that Pr[B0(t0)] = 1 \u2212 O(t \u2212A). Recall that by our assumption Pr[\u00acBi+1(ti+1)|Bi(ti)] = 1\u2212O(t \u2212A) for all i = 0, 1, . . . , l\u2212 1, so it follows that Pr[Bi(ti)] = 1 \u2212 O(t \u2212A) for all i = 0, 1, . . . , l. We use this fact, combined with the observation that Bl(tl) \u2286 Al(s) and Theorem 3.8 to get\nPr [\u00acBl+1(tl)|Bl(tl)] \u2264\ntl \u2211\ns=1\nPr[\u00acAl+1(s)|Bl(tl)]\n\u2264\ntl \u2211\ns=1\nPr[\u00acAl+1(s) \u2227 Bl(tl)]\nPr[Bl(tl)] \u2264\ntl \u2211\ns=1\nPr[\u00acAl+1(s) \u2227 Al(s)]\nPr[Bl(tl)]\n\u2264\ntl \u2211\ns=1\nPr[\u00acAl+1(s)|Al(s)]\nPr[Bl(tl)] =\ntl \u2211\ns=1\nO(t\u2212A)\n1\u2212O(t\u2212A) = O(t\u2212A).\nFinally, for any events E1, E2, E3 we have\nPr[\u00acE1|E2] = Pr[\u00acE1 \u2227 E3|E2] + Pr[\u00acE1 \u2227 \u00acE3|E2]\n\u2264 Pr[\u00acE1|E3 \u2227 E2] + Pr[\u00acE3|E2].\nWe substitute E1 = Bl+1(tl+1), E2 = Bl(tl) and E3 = Bl+1(tl) to obtain the final result.\nFinally, we present the main result of this section.\nTheorem 3.13. For Gt \u223c DD(t, p, r) with 0 < p < 1 and any constants \u03b1,A > 0 it holds asymptotically that\nPr [ \u2206(Gt) \u2265 (1 + \u03b1)t p ln2\u2212p 2 t ] = O(t\u2212A).\nProof. From Lemma 3.4 we know that Xtk \u2264 (1 + \u03b1)t p ln2\u2212p\n2\nt holds asymptotically. It follows that in this case\nPr [ \u2206(Gt) \u2265 (1 + \u03b1)t p ln2\u2212p 2 t ] \u2264 Pr[\u2206(Gt) \u2265 Xtk ] \u2264 Pr[\u00acBk(tk)]\n\u2264\nk\u22121 \u2211\nl=0\nPr[\u00acBl+1(tl+1)|Bl(tl)] + Pr[\u00acB0(t0)] .\nNow, from Theorem 3.8 and Lemma 3.12 we know that both Pr[\u00acB0(t0)] = O(t\u2212A) and Pr[\u00acBl+1(tl)|Bl(tl)] = O(t\n\u2212A) for any A > 0, respectively. Putting this all together with the fact that asymptotically as t \u2192 \u221e it holds that k \u2264 t we obtain the final result.\n3.3. Lower bound. Here we proceed analogously to the case of the upper bound for early vertices. We provide an appropriate Chernoff-type bound for the degree of a given vertex with respect to some deterministic sequence. Then we again use a special sequence, which has the desired rate of growth and serves as a lower bound on degt(s). Note that we don\u2019t need to extend our analysis for the late vertices since a lower bound for the degree of any vertex s at time t is also a lower bound for the minimum degree of Gt.\nNow, we note that if we start the whole process from a non-empty graph, then there exists s \u2208 [1, t0] such that degt0(s) \u2265 1. Moreover, even if the starting graph is empty, but r > 0, then with high probability there exists a vertex with positive degree, as the probability of adding another isolated vertex to an empty graph on t vertices is at most (1\u2212 rt )\nt \u2264 exp(\u2212r), so within first Ar ln t vertices for any A > 0 we have a non-isolated vertex with probability at least 1\u2212O(t\u2212A). Of course, if we start from an empty graph and r = 0, then for any p there is no edge in the duplication process. However, in this case it trivially follows that \u2206(Gt) = 0, so we omit this case in further analysis.\nThat said, let us now proceed with the aforementioned Chernoff-type lower bound for the degree of a given early vertex:\nLemma 3.14. Let 1 \u2264 s \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 t such that \u03c4 \u2265 \u03c6 = ln1+p t. Then for any A > 0 it is true that\nPr\n[\ndeg\u03c4+h(s)\u2212 deg\u03c4 (s) \u2264 2A(1\u2212 \u03b4)\n\u03b42 ln t\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 deg\u03c4 (s) \u2265 X\u03c4 ] = O(t\u2212A),\nwith \u03b5 = \u03b4 = p(1\u2212p)8 ln \u03c4 and h = 2A\u03c4 ln t \u03b42(1\u2212\u03b5)(pX\u03c4+r) .\nProof. Let us recall (as in the proof of Lemma 3.5) that for i = 0, 1, . . . , h\u2212 1 we\nhave deg\u03c4+i+1(s) = deg\u03c4+i(s)+I\u03c4+i where I\u03c4+i \u223c Be (q\u03c4+i) for q\u03c4+i = p deg\u03c4+i(s)+r \u03c4+i \u2212\nr deg\u03c4+i(s)\n(\u03c4+i)2 . Also clearly deg\u03c4+i(s) \u2265 deg\u03c4 (s) for any i = 0, 1, . . . , h, so we have\nq\u03c4+i = p deg\u03c4+i(s)\n(\n1\u2212 rp(\u03c4+i)\n)\n+ r\n\u03c4 + i \u2265\np deg\u03c4 (s) ( 1\u2212 rp\u03c4 ) + r\n\u03c4 + h\n\u2265 pX\u03c4\n( 1\u2212 \u03b52 ) + r \u03c4(1 + \u03b5) \u2265 (1\u2212 \u03b5) pX\u03c4 + r \u03c4 ,\nsince for \u03b5 = p(1\u2212p)8 ln \u03c4 it holds that h \u2264 \u03b5t and \u03b5 2 \u2265 rp\u03c4 . Therefore for any i = 0, 1, . . . , h\u22121 we know that I\u03c4+i stochastically dominates I \u2217 \u03c4+i \u223c Be ( (1\u2212 \u03b5)pX\u03c4+r\u03c4 ) .\nAs in the proof of the upper bound, the new variables are both Bernoulli and independent. So this time we can use the right tail Chernoff bound for binomial setting from [10] (see Corollary 21.7) which states that for any \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1)\nPr\n[\nh\u22121 \u2211\ni=0\nI\u2217\u03c4+i \u2264 (1\u2212 \u03b4)E\n[\nh\u22121 \u2211\ni=0\nI\u2217\u03c4+i\n]]\n\u2264 exp\n(\n\u2212 \u03b42\n2 E\n[\nh\u22121 \u2211\ni=0\nI\u2217\u03c4+i\n])\nand therefore\nPr\n[\ndeg\u03c4+h(s)\u2264deg\u03c4 (s) + (1 \u2212 \u03b4)(1\u2212 \u03b5) h(pX\u03c4 + r)\n\u03c4\n]\n\u2264exp\n(\n\u2212 h\u03b42(1\u2212 \u03b5)(pX\u03c4 + r)\n2\u03c4\n)\nas clearly Pr [ deg\u03c4+h(s)\u2212 deg\u03c4 (s) \u2264 k ]\n= Pr [\n\u2211h\u22121 i=0 I\u03c4+i \u2264 k\n] \u2264 Pr [\n\u2211h\u22121 i=0 I \u2217 \u03c4+i \u2264 k\n]\nfor any k, due to the stochastic dominance. To finish the proof it is sufficient to see that h = 2A\u03c4 ln t\u03b42(1\u2212\u03b5)(pX\u03c4+r) gives the required O(t\u2212A) bound in the last equation.\nIn the following, we again use sequences (ti) k i=1 and (Xti) k i=1 from Definition 3.2. Let us also define Ci(s) = [degti(s) > Xti \u2212 \u03c6 + 1] for a fixed s \u2264 ti. Now we are in the position to proceed with the main theorem of this section:\nTheorem 3.15. For Gt \u223c DD(t, p, r) with 0 < p < 1 there exists s such that it holds asymptotically that\nPr [degt(s) < (1 \u2212 \u03b1)t p] = O(t\u2212A)\nfor any constants \u03b1,A > 0.\nProof. Let us use \u03c6 = ln1+p t, \u03b2i = p \u2212 p(1\u2212p) 4 ln ti and wi = 2(A+1)ti ln t \u03b42(1\u2212\u03b5)(pXti+r) with \u03b4 = \u03b5 = p(1\u2212p)8 ln ti . Suppose that Ci(s) holds. Then we can apply Lemma 3.14 with \u03c4 = ti and h = wi:\nPr[\u00acCi+1(s)|Ci(s)] = Pr[degti+1(s) \u2264 Xti+1 | degti(s) > Xti \u2212 \u03c6+ 1]\n\u2264 Pr[degti+1(s)\u2212 degti(s) \u2264 Xti+1 \u2212Xti | degti(s) > Xti \u2212 \u03c6+ 1]\n= Pr\n[\ndegti+1(s)\u2212 degti(s) \u2264 \u03b2i wiXti ti\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 degti(s) > Xti \u2212 \u03c6+ 1\n]\n\u2264 Pr\n[\ndegti+1(s)\u2212 degti(s) \u2264 2(A+ 1)(1\u2212 \u03b4)\n\u03b42 ln t\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 degti(s) > Xti \u2212 \u03c6+ 1 ]\n= O(t\u2212A\u22121),\nwhere we used the fact that asymptotically as t \u2192 \u221e it holds that\n\u03b2iXti (1\u2212 \u03b4)(1 \u2212 \u03b5)(pXti + r) \u2264 p\u2212 p(1\u2212p)4 ln ti p(1\u2212 \u03b4 \u2212 \u03b5) = 1.\nNext, we get\nPr[degt(s) \u2264 Xtk \u2212 \u03c6+ 1] \u2264 Pr[degtk(s) \u2264 Xtk \u2212 \u03c6+ 1] = Pr[\u00acCk(s)]\n\u2264 k\u22121 \u2211\ni=0\nPr[\u00acCi+1(s)|Ci(s)] + Pr[\u00acC0(s)] = k\u22121 \u2211\ni=0\nO(t\u2212A\u22121) = O(t\u2212A),\nsince asymptotically it is true that wi \u2265 1 for all i = 0, . . . , k, and therefore k \u2264 t. To complete the proof it is sufficient to note that t \u2264 tk \u2264 (1 +\u03b1)tk\u22121 \u2264 (1 +\u03b1)t for any constant \u03b1 > 0 and thus Xtk \u2264 (1 + \u03b1)t p.\n4. Average degree. Now let us proceed to the results on the average degree of Gt defined as\nD(Gt) = 1\nt\nt \u2211\ns=1\ndegt(s).\nFirst, we recall from [30, Theorem 9(iii)] that for any \u03c4 = t0, . . . , t \u2212 1 it holds asymptotically (i.e. when t0 \u2192 \u221e) that\nE[deg\u03c4 (\u03c4)] =\n\n          \n         \nD(Gt0) p\u0393(t0)\u0393(t0+1) \u0393(t0+c3)\u0393(t0+c4) \u03c42p\u22121(1 + o(1)) if p \u2264 12 , r = 0, r(1 + o(1)) if p = 0, r > 0, (\nr(1\u2212p) p(1\u22122p) \u2212 r p\n)\n(1 + o(1)) if 0 < p < 12 , r > 0,\nr log \u03c4 (1 + o(1)) if p = 12 , r > 0, (\nD(Gt0) + 2rt0\nt2 0 +2pt0\u22122r 3\nF2 [ t0+1,t0+1,1 t0+c3+1,t0+c4+1 ; 1 ]\n)\np\u0393(t0)\u0393(t0+1) \u0393(t0+c3)\u0393(t0+c4) \u03c42p\u22121(1 + o(1)) if p > 12 ,\nwhere D(Gt0) is the average degree of the initial graph Gt0 and\n3F2 [ a1,a2,a3 b1,b2 ; z ] =\n\u221e \u2211\nl=0\n(a1)l(a2)l(a3)l (b1)l(b2)l\nzl\nl!\nis the generalized hypergeometric function with (a)l = a(a+1) . . . (a+ l\u22121), (a)0 = 1 the rising factorial (see [1] for details).\nIn short, if we omit constant factors, there are three regimes of growth: constant, ln t, and t2p\u22121. We need to find the proper high probability bound for each case separately, however it turns out that the proofs are very similar.\n4.1. Upper bound. Now we may proceed to the main result of this section: the upper bound for the average degree of Gt. It turns out that there are exactly two regimes with somewhat different behavior:\nTheorem 4.1. Asymptotically for Gt \u223c DD(t, p, r) it holds that\nPr[D(Gt) \u2265 AC ln t] = O(t \u2212A) for p \u2264\n1 2 ,\nPr[D(Gt) \u2265 C t 2p\u22121] = O(t\u2212A) for p >\n1 2 .\nfor some fixed constant C > 0 and any A > 0.\nProof. For simplicity, we will work with the total number of edges \u03c4D(G\u03c4 ) instead of D(G\u03c4 ). Clearly, for any \u03c4 = t0, . . . , t\u2212 1 it holds that\n(\u03c4 + 1)D(G\u03c4+1)\u2212 \u03c4D(G\u03c4 ) = 2 deg\u03c4+1(\u03c4 + 1),\ndeg\u03c4+1(\u03c4 + 1) \u223c Bin(deg\u03c4 (parent(\u03c4 + 1)), p) +Bin(\u03c4 \u2212 deg\u03c4 (parent(\u03c4 + 1)), r/\u03c4).\nTherefore, we can use Chernoff bound to obtain for any \u03b4 \u2265 0\nPr [ (\u03c4 + 1)D(G\u03c4+1)\u2212 \u03c4D(G\u03c4 ) \u2265 2 (1 + \u03b4)E[deg\u03c4+1(\u03c4 + 1)] ]\n\u2264 exp\n(\n\u2212 2\u03b42\n2 + \u03b4 E[deg\u03c4+1(\u03c4 + 1)]\n)\n.\nNow, for p > 12 we know that E[deg\u03c4 (\u03c4)] \u2264 C \u2217\u03c42p\u22121 for some constant C\u2217 > 0.\nThus, it is sufficient to set t0 = t p/3 and \u03b4 =\n\u221a\n3(A+1) ln t 2C\u2217\u03c42p\u22121 = o(1) for all \u03c4 = t0, . . . , t\u22121\nto get\nPr [ (\u03c4 + 1)D(G\u03c4+1)\u2212 \u03c4D(G\u03c4 ) \u2265 2(1 + \u03b4)C \u2217 \u03c42p\u22121 ] = O(t\u2212A\u22121),\nand by summing over all \u03c4 that no event from polynomial tails happens we obtain\nPr [ tD(Gt) \u2265 C t 2p ] \u2264 Pr\n[\ntD(Gt)\u2212 t0D(Gt0) \u2265 t\u22121 \u2211\ni=t0\n2(1 + \u03b4)C\u2217 \u03c42p\u22121\n]\n= O(t\u2212A),\nfor any constant C \u2265 t\u22122p \u2211t\u22121 i=t0 2(1+\u03b4)C\u2217 \u03c42p\u22121+ t\u22122pt0D(Gt0 ) \u2013 and such constant indeed exists since it is not hard to verify that the latter sum is finite.\nIn all cases 0 < p \u2264 12 it turns out that \u221a 3(A+1) ln t 2C\u2217\u03c42p\u22121 \u2192 \u221e. However, for 0 < p \u2264 1 2 , r > 0 we have E[deg\u03c4 (\u03c4)] \u2264 C \u2217 ln \u03c4 for some constant C\u2217 > 0, and we can assume \u03b4 \u2192 \u221e such that\n1 + \u03b4\n2 \u2264\n\u03b42\n2 + \u03b4 =\n(A+ 1) ln t\n2C\u2217 ln \u03c4 ,\nso therefore\nPr[(\u03c4 + 1)D(G\u03c4+1)\u2212 \u03c4D(G\u03c4 ) \u2265 2(A+ 1) ln t] = O(t \u2212A\u22121),\nPr[tD(Gt) \u2265 AC t ln t] \u2264 Pr\n[\ntD(Gt)\u2212 t0D(Gt0) \u2265\nt\u22121 \u2211\ni=t0\n2(A+ 1) ln i\n]\n= O(t\u2212A),\nfor some constant C \u2265 2 + t0At ln tD(Gt0) when t0 = t 1/3.\nFinally, let us study the case 0 < p < 12 , r = 0. Again we know that E[deg\u03c4 (\u03c4)] \u2264 C\u2217\u03c42p\u22121 for some constant C\u2217 > 0. Again, we can assume\n1 + \u03b4\n2 \u2264\n\u03b42\n2 + \u03b4 =\n(A+ 1) ln t\n2C\u2217\u03c42p\u22121 ,\nso by a similar reasoning as before we get\nPr[(\u03c4 + 1)D(G\u03c4+1)\u2212 \u03c4D(G\u03c4 ) \u2265 2(A+ 1) ln t] = O(t \u2212A\u22121),\nPr[tD(Gt) \u2265 AC t ln t] \u2264 Pr\n[\ntD(Gt)\u2212 t0D(Gt0) \u2265 t\u22121 \u2211\ni=t0\n2(A+ 1) ln t\n]\n= O(t\u2212A),\nfor sufficiently large constant C when t0 = t 1/3.\n4.2. Lower bound. We now turn our attention to establishing the corresponding lower bound. Note that since E[D(Gt)] = O(log t) for p \u2264 1 2 , the lower polynomial tail is trivial in this range since all smaller values are within the polylogarithmic distance from the mean. However, we can investigate the case p > 12 .\nTheorem 4.2. For Gt \u223c DD(t, p, r) with p > 1 2 asymptotically it holds that\nPr [ D(Gt) \u2264 C t 2p\u22121 ] = O(t\u2212A).\nfor some fixed constant C > 0 and any A > 0.\nProof. Similarly as before, we invoke the appropriate Chernoff bound for \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1)\nPr [ (\u03c4 + 1)D(G\u03c4+1)\u2212 \u03c4D(G\u03c4 ) \u2264 2 (1\u2212 \u03b4)E[deg\u03c4+1(\u03c4 + 1)] ]\n\u2264 exp ( \u2212\u03b42E[deg\u03c4+1(\u03c4 + 1)] ) .\nFor p > 12 it is true that E[deg\u03c4 (\u03c4)] \u2265 C \u2217\u03c42p\u22121 for some constant C\u2217 > 0. Thus,\nit is sufficient to set t0 = t p/3 and \u03b4 =\n\u221a\n(A+1) ln t C\u2217\u03c42p\u22121 \u2264 1 2 for all \u03c4 = t0, . . . , t\u2212 1 to get\nPr [ (\u03c4 + 1)D(G\u03c4+1)\u2212 \u03c4D(G\u03c4 ) \u2264 2(1\u2212 \u03b4)C \u2217\u03c42p\u22121 ] = O(t\u2212A\u22121),\nwhich leads us to\nPr [ tD(Gt)\u2212 t0D(Gt0) \u2264 C t 2p ]\n\u2264 Pr\n[\ntD(Gt)\u2212 t0D(Gt0) \u2264\nt\u22121 \u2211\ni=t0\n2(1\u2212 \u03b4)C\u2217 \u03c42p\u22121\n]\n= O(t\u2212A).\nfor any constant 0 < C \u2264 t\u22122p \u2211t\u22121 i=t0 2(1 \u2212 \u03b4)C\u2217 \u03c42p\u22121 + t\u22122pt0D(Gt0) \u2013 and such constant indeed exists since it is not hard to verify that the latter sum is non-zero and finite when t0 = t 1/3.\n5. Further challenges. In this paper we focus on deriving large deviations for the average and the maximum degree in the duplication-divergence networks. By a simple martingale argument one can show that \u2206(Gt)/t\np converges to some random variable \u2206. However, it is still worth asking whether \u2206 has finite support (e.g. dependent only on p and r, but not on t).\nA natural next challenge would be to obtain the exact asymptotic formula for the whole degree distribution. For example, there is an open question whether DD(t, p, r) graphs are scale-free, i.e. they have \u0398(k\u2212\u03b3) fraction of vertices with degree k. A first step towards this goal was already done for r = 0 in [18, 16], where it was proved that this property indeed holds for the (only) giant component p < e\u22121. However, it was noticed in [14] that for r = 0 and all 0 < p < 1 such phenomenon does not appear in the whole graph, since almost all vertices are isolated, thus for any k > 0 the fraction of vertices of degree k tends to 0 as t \u2192 \u221e.\nFinally, finding good bounds on the concentration of both D(Gt) and \u2206(Gt) is only the step towards the full understanding of this model, as we still do not know for example how symmetric such networks are. This, in turn, we believe could help find good compression algorithms for these types of networks, as was the case with other graph models [3, 23].\nREFERENCES\n[1] M. Abramowitz and I.
