Air quality (PM2.5) was monitored in participant homes for seven days before their first pharmacy visit and 12 weeks later. Qualitative interviews (N = 14) were conducted with 13 participants who completed the study and one who withdrew part-way through. The interviews explored views/ experiences of using nicotine replacement therapy to help create a smoke-free home. Another participant took part in a shorter telephone discussion at their request, with detailed notes taken by the interviewer, because of their speech disorder.\nResults Three participants reported smoking outdoors only, one of whom subsequently quit smoking. Six participants reported reduced cigarette consumption by 50% in the home, four reported no (sustained) reduction and one reported increased smoking indoors. Self-reported outcomes were not always consistent with PM2.5 readings. Participants\u2019 experiences of accessing nicotine replacement therapy through community pharmacies varied. Some suggested ongoing support to use nicotine replacement products could better assist behavioural change, and that access could be streamlined by posting products to the home. Several suggested that focusing on changing home smoking behaviours using nicotine replacement therapy might facilitate a future quit attempt.\nConclusion Access to free nicotine replacement therapy for temporary use indoors may support some people who smoke to reduce children\u2019s exposure to second-hand smoke.

            "text": "The extensive range of harmful health effects associated with children\u2019s exposure to second-hand smoke (SHS) are well established [1\u20133]. Creating a smoke-free home is key to reducing children\u2019s SHS exposure, and it may also increase the likelihood of quitting smoking [4, 5] and reduce smoking uptake amongst adolescents [6, 7].\nIn Scotland, analysis of 2015 Scottish Health Survey data highlights a clear social inequality in children\u2019s exposure to SHS, with 12% of children exposed to SHS at home in the most socio-economically disadvantaged areas of Scotland, compared to less than 1% of children living in Scotland\u2019s most affluent areas [8]. This pattern has been found in several other countries including the USA, [9] Australia, [10] Germany, [11] Spain, [12] Denmark [13] and Japan [14]. The specific challenges adults who smoke living in disadvantage face in creating a smoke-free home are well documented, [15] and include sole caring for young children, and living in accommodation with limited/no access to suitable and safe outdoor space, which constrains opportunities to smoke outside [16].\nThere is currently no recommended approach to tackle this inequality, [17, 18] which may have been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the UK, 12% of people who smoke who live with children reported smoking indoors more than they did before lockdown restrictions were imposed, [19] reinforcing the need for innovative approaches to developing interventions to better support parents/carers to create a smoke-free family home [20].\nNational Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) harm reduction guidance has identified the role of Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) for temporary abstinence for people who do not want, or are not ready, to stop smoking [21]. NHS Health Scotland\u2019s Harm Reduction Addendum [22] recommends that cessation services should advocate NRT for people who smoke, for temporary abstinence to avoid exposing others to SHS in the home. NRT could offer a means to overcome constraints such as lack of access to outdoor space, limited mobility and sole parenting. New approaches are timely and important given the Scottish Government\u2019s ambition for a tobacco-free generation by 2034.\u00a0A recent review of Scottish Government data concludes that Scotland may miss this target by 16 years in the poorest neighbourhoods [23].\nFindings from a recent randomised controlled trial suggest that providing parents with a 12-week supply of NRT for temporary abstinence in the home alongside behavioural support and feedback on SHS exposure levels using air quality monitoring led to decreased SHS concentrations and cigarettes smoked in the home. Costeffectiveness was demonstrated, but the specific effects of NRT for temporary abstinence remain unclear based on the findings from this multi-component intervention [24, 25]. To explore the sole use of NRT to create a smokefree home, members of our research team conducted a two-phase development study [26]. Phase 1 qualitative interview findings suggested parents were open to using NRT to create a smoke-free home, viewing this as a safer option than using e-cigarettes indoors. In Phase 2, an NHS advisor discussed NRT product choice with 20 participating parents who used NRT for up to 12 weeks in the home, with ongoing support available from local community pharmacy staff. Whilst most participants reported positive changes to their smoking habits, findings relied on self-report measures of smoke-free home success, which may not be accurate if other household members smoke in the home, and may also be influenced by social desirability bias [27, 28]. In addition, the multistep process used to access NRT was cumbersome and a barrier to engagement in some cases.\nIn Scotland, community pharmacies deliver a national smoking cessation service and staff are therefore trained to support patient selection of/counselling on appropriate use of NRT products. The Scottish Government has recently called for improved use of community pharmacies as the first port of call for health-related advice [29]. This study aimed to explore the feasibility of providing parents/carers with NRT for temporary abstinence in the home using a streamlined approach to NRT provision, through engagement solely with local community pharmacies. This eliminated the need for initial home visits by a trained NHS adviser (as per previous studies), as pharmacy staff discussed NRT product choice with participants."

More than one adult member of a household could take part provided they met these criteria. We included grandparents, aunts and uncles in our sample as they play an important role to families living in areas of high deprivation, often providing secondary care for children [30]. Exclusion criteria included individuals who were prescribed Warfarin, Clozapine, Theophylline, or Aminophylline, as NRT use in combination with any of these medications would require close blood monitoring from their GP. All individuals were recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic using paid social media (Facebook) advertising, focused on areas within a one-mile radius of the eight participating community pharmacies. All but one of the pharmacies were situated in higher deprivation postcode areas as measured by the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD).\nIndividuals who were interested in participating submitted their contact details securely online and were telephoned by a study team member to confirm eligibility. They were emailed the participant information sheet, and after 48\u00a0h, with consent to participate provided, choice of participating pharmacy and a suitable date for baseline in-home air quality measurement were agreed."

Fifteen participants completed the study. Participant numbers in each part of the study are illustrated in Table\u00a02 (Tables\u00a01 and 2 to be placed here).\nDuring qualitative interviews, two participants reported creating a smoke-free home, one of whom subsequently quit smoking. A third participant reported smoking outdoors only, though their home wasn\u2019t smokefree as their son smoked in his bedroom. Six participants reported reducing the amount they smoked indoors, five of whom reported reduced daily smoking by 50% or more. Four participants reported no change/no sustained change to the amount they were smoking indoors. One participant noted they were smoking more often in the home. As highlighted in Table\u00a01, self-reported outcomes were often, but not always consistent with PM2.5 readings. Approximately half of participants who completed the study (7/15)\u00a0reported changes in home smoking that were consistent with their baseline to follow up PM2.5 levels. However, just under half (6/15) reported changes that were inconsistent with PM2.5 levels (i.e. reporting reduced smoking in the home when baseline to follow up PM2.5 levels had increased). A few (2/15) reported changes that were in the same overall direction as PM2.5 levels, though reported changes were more substantial than baseline to follow up PM2.5 levels suggested (i.e. reporting significant reductions in smoking in the home, whereas baseline to follow up PM2.5 levels reduced only slightly).\nAccessing NRT through community pharmacies Participants had varied experiences of accessing NRT through community pharmacies. Some found staff to be very helpful:\n\u201cThey explained about each product, what each thing [NRT product] is best for, and if\u2026if it didn\u2019t work or anything like that, just to come back.\u201d (Participant 8, Parent).\nOthers felt that their consultations were rushed and that they were given insufficient details about different types of NRT to inform their choice of product:\n\u201cI went and I explained [why I was there] and she says, \u2018take something off the shelf.\u2019\u2026She wasnae help-\nful at all\u2026So I just looked at two things [NRT products] and said, \u2018that, and that.\u2019\u2026Honestly, I think she was rushed off her feet.\u201d (Participant 12, Grandparent).\nSeveral participants attributed less positive experiences to community pharmacies being extremely busy during the COVID-19 pandemic (\u201cSmoking would be the last thing on their minds at the moment.\u201d (Participant 23, Grandparent)). Locum staff temporarily fulfilled community pharmacy staff duties during sickness absence and this may have contributed to some occasions where staff engaging with participants were not familiar with the study:\n\u201cThe guy actually didn\u2019t really know what I was there for when I told him, and he was a bit confused so it was a bit embarrassing and I had to explain everything to him\u2026so I just decided to pick the [NRT] spray myself.\u201d (Participant 23, Grandparent).\nSeveral spoke of the stigma associated with smoking in the home and some said they felt less comfortable about engaging in face-to-face consultations with pharmacy staff, as private consultation rooms were not in use due to COVID-19 restrictions. They suggested private discussion spaces would be important in any future study building on this work:\n\u201cI was quite conscious of the fact I was talking about smoking in my house in public and that\u2019s, you know, a bit embarrassing and a taboo topic\u2026Our local pharmacy is far more intimate [than the one I visited for this study]. So you would absolutely want to do it behind a closed door there\u2026because you know, you\u2019re in amongst your neighbours, within ear-shot of everyone.\u201d (Participant 5, Parent).\nOnly five participants made more than one visit to their nominated pharmacy to access further NRT supplies, or to change NRT product, in most cases reporting positive experiences (\u201cThey were really quite good with explaining things and advised on what\u2019s the best thing to do\u201d (Participant 8, Parent)). However, one participant was \u201ctoo ashamed to go back\u201d to collect more NRT when she ran"

A few (including Participant 8) were still using their NRT product at the time of interview:\n\u201cIf I\u2019m doing housework and I really want a cigarette, [before] I would have stopped and had a cigarette and a coffee. Now I go and just have a couple of puffs of that [NRT spray] and carry on what I was doing\u2026the more the days and weeks go on, the less cigarettes I\u2019m having\u2026I\u2019m hoping by the time this [NRT] packet\u2019s finished I\u2019ll have stopped [smoking], and if not, I\u2019ll go and buy another packet, it\u2019s a lot cheaper than going and buying cigarettes\u2026and far, far healthier [laughs]\u201d (Participant 2, Grandparent).\nBarriers to smoking only outdoors"

One individual noted that:\n\u201cTo start with, I was [smoking] in the kitchen with the back door open or in the garden, but it got to the stage where it was getting too cold, wet and miserable.\u201d (Participant 17, Grandparent).\nSeveral participants suggested it was easier to smoke outside during the summer months, and this was also reflected in one account where smoking indoors had increased over the course of the study:\n\u201cAt the time when this [study] started, I was religiously going outside and having one outside, but then it got colder\u2026and I was smoking more in the house\u201d (Participant 9, Grandparent).\nBy contrast, one participant who had successfully created a smoke-free home suggested that cold, wet weather could help him to further reduce the amount he smoked per day because he wouldn\u2019t be motivated to smoke outside (\u201cI\u2019m only having four cigarettes now. But\u2026as it\u2019s getting colder and wetter, I think that\u2019s likely to just decrease.\u201d (Participant 6, Grandparent)).\nNuanced differences in self-reported outcomes were observed associated with timing of the intervention (see Table\u00a01) \u2013 those who completed the study in the Spring/ Summer tended to report positive changes in smoking behaviours, whereas those reporting no changes participated in the Autumn/Winter.\nStigma associated with Smoking in public The stigma of smoking was another barrier for a few grandparents in particular, who were reluctant to take their smoking outside. One thought that smoking was a private activity, to be \u201ckept away from as many people as possible [outdoors]\u201d (Participant 9), others disliked smoking in public because their mothers had perceived this to be \u201ccommon\u201d (Participants 16 and 23), or because they feared people would stare at them (Participant 12)."

            "text": "Several individuals who took part had pre-existing health conditions, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Participants who had changed their home smoking behaviours generally reported perceived improvements to their respiratory health:\n\u201cSo with smoking less in the house now as well, I\u2019ve noticed that I can breathe better. And I don\u2019t wake up in the morning coughing as much either.\u201d (Participant 1, Grandparent).\nSome participants also reported financial benefits associated with taking part, with one using the money she would have spent on tobacco to help pay for a holiday: \u201cI honestly wouldn\u2019t have been able to do it if I had been still smoking as much\u201d (Participant 24, Carer). Other participants found that smoking less when their children/ grandchildren were present meant they spent more time together: \u201cIt also helped me engage with the kids more\u201d (Participant 16, Grandparent).\nAlthough not all participants found the NRT helpful, there was wide support for the notion of access to free NRT to enable people who smoke to reduce smoking in the home. Most interviewees reported smoking for between 30 and 55 years. Several spoke of feeling pressured by health professionals to quit smoking, suggesting that changing home smoking behaviours first might help some people who smoke to move towards quitting in the future. Reducing smoking in the home was therefore sometimes viewed as a possible stepping stone to quitting:\n\u201cA lot of people, I think, find it hard just to give up, even if they\u2019ve got NRT. So I think, if they [health professionals] motivated people and said, like, \u2018well, first off, try not smoking in the house\u2019, instead of saying, \u2018just give up smoking\u2019\u2026then you\u2019re cutting down slowly, and you don\u2019t realise you\u2019re taking longer between cigarettes\u2026I think, yeah, people would probably be more successful in stopping in the end.\u201d (Participant 19, Parent)."

A few\ngrandparents suggested telephone conversations would be preferable as \u201ca lot of people, they\u2019ve not got the capacity with computers, where[as] a phone call would be much easier\u201d (Participant 3, Grandparent).

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "Our findings suggest that providing individuals with access to free NRT for temporary abstinence in the home may help some to reduce or eliminate smoking in the home. This approach, which was widely accepted by study participants, builds on the findings of our first development study, with similar outcomes reported [26].\nIn our first development study, [26] participants often exceeded their own expectations of changing their smoking behaviours, with minimal or no support from pharmacy staff. By contrast several participants in this study felt that ongoing support for (effective) NRT use would be beneficial in future. This may to some extent reflect the composition of our sample. Several participants had smoked for between 30 and 55 years, and may therefore have found it difficult to change smoking behaviours with little to no support. Some participants only used NRT for a few days as they didn\u2019t like the taste. This has been shown to be a potential risk factor for non-adherence to NRT in previous (cessation) studies, [32, 33] and yet most people get used to the taste of NRT after a few days [34]. Additional research is required to better understand why some participants stopped using NRT and how barriers such as taste can be better overcome. In future, issues of adherence could be addressed by provision of additional support for NRT use through community pharmacies.\nIn previous studies, [24, 26] access to NRT required an initial home visit from a trained NHS smoking adviser, and a subsequent visit to the local community pharmacy. We streamlined this process so that individuals discussed NRT product choice with community pharmacy staff, anticipating this would be more appealing and less burdensome based on our initial development work. In Scotland, community pharmacies remained open throughout the pandemic, offering a mobilised, accessible setting for intervention. However, the need for social distancing measures to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 often led to significant queuing outside pharmacies, and whilst staff were generally very welcoming to participants, in several cases (including when temporary staff were brought in to cover staff sickness absence) they did not have enough knowledge about the study to support participants. These experiences, alongside the\npreference for private consultation spaces to discuss home smoking with pharmacy staff, are similar to those described by some participants in our first development study, conducted prior to the pandemic [26, 35]. We planned to conduct interviews with pharmacy staff to learn about their experiences of taking part, but were only able to conduct one interview across the eight participating pharmacies because of competing demands on staff time. Further investigation into the challenges faced by community pharmacy staff in supporting this type of intervention would be valuable. Insights gathered could improve the intervention process, help to ensure that staff are sufficiently trained to engage effectively with participants, and identify any additional service developments required to equip community pharmacies to effectively house this intervention. Alternatively, existing NHS cessation services could be utilised, given the potential for reduced smoking in the home to lead to quitting/ increased motivation to quit in some cases. NHS cessation service staff may be better placed than community pharmacy staff to support ongoing use of NRT through regular phone calls, which some participants in the current study suggested would be helpful. The inclusion of regular phone calls in future study design could also help to identify solutions to challenges to creating a smokefree home including colder, wetter weather and perceived stigma associated with smoking in public, which are both documented in other studies [15].\nSelf-reported outcomes were often, but not always, consistent with PM2.5 readings obtained at baseline and follow-up. Whilst self-report data on smoking in the home provides useful information (see [36] for discussion regarding the reasons to collect it), it is sometimes unreliable and/or systematically biased towards underreporting as a result of the influence of attitudes and social norms [28]. Even when individuals report home smoking rules and their associated smoking behaviours reliably, the research questions asked of them may not be sufficiently detailed to capture all scenarios which result in increased levels of exposure [36]. For example, one possible reason for discrepancies observed is smoking by other adult household members in the home [27]. Seasonal effects caused by reduced indoor ventilation during the winter months (i.e. keeping windows closed), increased burning of candles and/or an increase in wood and coal combustion for heating [37, 38] would also result in higher PM2.5 concentrations, which could be confused for SHS in interpretation of PM2.5 data [38]. If feedback on PM2.5 levels wrongly identifies non-SHS sources as being smoking activity this is likely to weaken the effectiveness of assessing smoke-free home interventions and result in participants questioning the validity of the measurement method [38]. It has been suggested that the combination of a biological marker of SHS\n(salivary cotinine, child urine cotinine, hair nicotine) and an environmental measure (air quality measurement, air nicotine monitors) used in conjunction with self-report measures enhances the reliability of assessments of SHS exposure [39]. The inclusion of a biological marker such as child salivary cotinine would overcome potential confounding environmental factors like indoor air quality changes caused by sources other than smoking and should be included in future studies.\nOur findings provide additional evidence regarding the acceptability/feasibility of use of NRT for temporary abstinence in the home, which is important given there is currently no recommended approach to tackle this health inequality [17]. We successfully engaged with several participants who had smoked for between 30 and 55 years, many of whom found the idea of quitting smoking particularly difficult, but were motivated to use NRT to change their daily home smoking routines. Conducting this research during the pandemic was challenging and a larger number of participants than we anticipated withdrew or disengaged, often because of pandemic-related life events. The researcher who conducted most of the interviews was also known to participants during the study (e.g. they took informed consent and established product suitability), which may have introduced some bias."
