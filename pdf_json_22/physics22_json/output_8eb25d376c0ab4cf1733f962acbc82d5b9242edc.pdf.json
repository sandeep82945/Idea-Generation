In that Ref. 1, the chemotaxis of cargo-carrying active particles in a self-propelled force gradient was studied. In its conclusion part, the authors suggested that active bodies inside a container moving in a gradient of activity can give rise to chemotactic motion of the container, which is similar to a special case among our many systems, i.e., the ACC filled with linear active Brownian particles in the\ninhomogeneous self-propelled force environment. Clearly, our simulation result of the special case [Fig. 6(a)] is consistent with their suggestion.\nWe thank the authors of Ref. 1 for helpful remarks."
