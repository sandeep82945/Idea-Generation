1. **Investigate the causal relationship between non-verbal intelligence and GPA in women and men separately.** This could be done through longitudinal studies that follow students over time to see how their non-verbal intelligence and GPA change. This would help to determine whether non-verbal intelligence is a cause of GPA or vice versa.


2. **Explore the role of other psychological variables in academic achievement, such as grit, resilience, and growth mindset.** These variables have been shown to be important for success in other areas of life, and it is possible that they also play a role in academic achievement.


3. **Examine the relationship between health variables and academic achievement.** The study found that non-verbal intelligence was associated with somatization and the number of diseases in women. This suggests that there may be a link between physical health and academic achievement. Future studies could investigate this relationship in more detail.


4. **Investigate the effects of intervention programs that are designed to improve academic achievement.** These programs could target specific psychological variables, such as self-motivation or emotion regulation, or they could focus on improving students' overall health and well-being.


5. **Explore the role of culture in academic achievement.** The study was conducted in a specific cultural context, and it is possible that the results would be different in other cultures. Future studies could investigate the role of culture in academic achievement in different countries and regions.
