Here, we present a laser vibrometry study of the acoustic response of suspended multilayer graphene membranes for microphone applications. We address performance parameters relevant for acoustic sensing, including mechanical sensitivity, limit of detection and nonlinear distortion, and discuss the trade-offs and limitations in the design of graphene microphones. We demonstrate superior mechanical sensitivities of the graphene membranes, reaching more than 2 orders of magnitude higher compliances than commercial MEMS devices, and report a limit of detection as low as 15 dBSPL, which is 10\u201315 dB lower than that featured by current MEMS microphones.",

            "text": "MEMS microphone technology, based on Si manufacturing processes, has benefited from the proliferation of portable electronic devices, experiencing unprecedented market growth1 (reaching around 8 billion sold units in 2022) as well as continuous design and production improvements.2,3 One of the main device development targets is the optimization of the\nmechanical sensitivity, which determines the microphone\u2019s ability to pick up sound. The mechanical sensitivity, defined as the membrane\u2019s displacement amplitude per unit sound pressure, scales inversely with the thickness and stress of the sensing membrane.2 Complex fabrication techniques involving corrugated membranes4,5 or not-fully supported membranes6\u20138 have been implemented to reduce residual fabrication stress and boost sensitivity of thin MEMS membranes.\nBeing ultrathin and lightweight, suspended graphene membranes are excellent candidates for use in electrostatically actuated devices9\u201311 and sensors,12 such as pressure sensors,13\u201315 gas sensors16 and accelerometers17 as well as microphones.18\u201325 Thanks to their atomic thickness, graphene membranes could be made more than a factor 100\u20131000 times thinner than typical 0.1\u20131.0 \u00b5m thick MEMS membranes, resulting in a significant increase of the microphone mechanical sensitivity without requiring complex device structures. On top of that, graphene is an excellent conductor and thus requires no additional layer for electrical readout. Previous studies have demonstrated the fabrication of microphones using graphene-based membranes either with multilayer graphene18\u201320 or with a composite structure made of bilayer or multilayer graphene and a thick (>100 nm) PMMA layer.21\u201325 In general, these works focused on fabricating a condenser microphone structure, involving either wet or dry transfer20\u201322 of large graphene membranes (from 2 to 12 mm in diameter) over pre-patterned substrates or via dry etching of a sacrificial \u2020Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Fig. S1: Raman spectrum of graphene samples; Fig. S2: AFM characterization of graphene samples; Fig. S3: Mechanical sensitivities at 1 kHz of all measured samples: Fig. S4: Measurements of resonance frequency in vacuum and comparison with resonance in air; Fig. S5: Effects of wrinkles on membrane\u2019s mode shape; Fig. S6: SEM pictures of graphene membranes; Fig. S7: Mechanical compliance corrected by resonance frequency; Fig. S8: Growth and transfer process of the graphene membranes; Movie V1: LynceeTec mode shape imaging of graphene membrane; Movie V2: LynceeTec mode shape imaging of wrinkled graphene membrane; Audio A1: music track (Ode to joy) recorded on optically on multilayer graphene membrane.

Although these works have demonstrated successful capacitive readout of audio signals with high output voltage per unit pressure, other important device performance parameters, like the mechanical sensitivity, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), total harmonic distortion (THD), bandwidth and dynamic range, have been less extensively characterized. Following common conventions for microphone specifications, we define these parameters using the reference input frequency and reference pressure level as 1 kHz and 1 Pa = 94 dBSPL respectively:\n\u2022 Sensitivity: ratio between electrical output and input sound pressure, usually expressed in mV Pa\u22121 for capacitive microphones. This overall sensitivity is a combination of electrical sensitivity, which depends on the readout-circuit and amplification, and mechanical sensitivity.2 In this work, we address the mechanical sensitivity, given by the ratio between membrane\u2019s displacement and input pressure which strongly depends on the material properties and membranes dimensions.\n\u2022 Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): ratio between output in response from a reference signal (1 kHz at 1 Pa) and noise level of the microphone.\n\u2022 Dynamic range: difference between the maximum and minimum sound pressure level that the microphone can handle. The maximum detectable sound is determined by the amount of nonlinear distortion in the microphone response.\n\u2022 Total harmonic distortion (THD): measures the level of distortion at the output and it is defined as the ratio between the sum of the powers of the harmonics and the fundamental tone. Maximum detectable sound is determined by the acoustic overload point (AOP) corresponding to THD = 10%.\nIn this work, we use a Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) to carry out a detailed study of the response of multilayer graphene (MLG) membranes to acoustic actuation, and determine their most important performance parameters such that they can be compared to the stateof-the-art. The advantage of optical vibrometry is that it allows direct determination of the mechanical response of graphene membranes to sound, in contrast to electrical methods, where the output voltage depends on the specifics of the readout circuit. Moreover, by using it to characterize freestanding membranes, it allows measurement of the intrinsic membrane characteristics without including effects of a backplate that is used in capacitive condenser microphones. Thus, we gain deeper insights into graphene\u2019s acoustic properties, which is crucial for the design of future MEMS graphene microphones."

The freestanding membranes are made of multilayer graphene with a thickness of \u223c8 nm grown on Si/SiO2/Mo (50 nm) by LowPressure Chemical Vapor Deposition in an Aixtron Black Magic reactor at 1000 \u00b0C with H2\u2013CH4 as carbon precursor source. The Mo seed layer under the graphene is wet-etched with H2O2 and deionized water, after which the graphene remains on the Si/SiO2 substrate.\n26 The graphene is finally immersed in DIwater until it delaminates and it is carefully wet-transferred on a Si/SiO2 substrate (thickness of \u223c520 \u00b5m) with pre-patterned holes. These holes, with a diameter of \u223c350\u2013600 \u00b5m were etched through the silicon chips by Deep Reaction Ion Etching (DRIE) and buffered oxide etch (BOE) to remove the SiO2 hard mask. Finally, the chip with suspended graphene membranes is dried in atmospheric conditions for >10 hours.\nThe graphene used in this study has been found to be strong enough to sustain drying in atmospheric conditions, without a need for critical point drying. The high mechanical quality of the graphene is related to its high uniformity.27 Furthermore, the membranes are completely freely suspended over the through holes, which alleviates the possibility of liquid formation between the graphene and the substrate. The crystallinity of the graphene as well as its thickness were investigated via Raman and atomic force microscopy (see Fig. S1 and S2 in the ESI\u2020)."

            "text": "We investigate the acoustic spectrum of the graphene membranes by measuring their centre displacement in response to an acoustic chirp from 200 Hz to 20 kHz. Owing to frequency\nlimitation of the speaker used, our setup did not enable accurate characterization of the membranes at frequencies below 100 Hz. Fig. 2a shows typical frequency responses from the LDV (in blue) and from the reference microphone (in red). The reference signal (in red) is measured before placing the sample on the reference microphone, in order to avoid any shading of the sound from the speaker. The vibrometer outputs a voltage signal VLDV proportional to the membranes displacement, z, where VLDV = zRLDV. Similarly, the output voltage of the reference microphone is proportional to the incoming sound pressure level by its calibrated sensitivity in the audible range. After correcting for the vibrometer\u2019s responsivity (in nm V\u22121) and for the calibrated sensitivity of the microphone (in mV Pa\u22121), the ratio of the two voltage signals in Fig. 2a yields the mechanical sensitivity in nm Pa\u22121 of the graphene membrane, which is shown in Fig. 2b.\nFollowing this methodology, we characterize the acoustic response of multilayer graphene membranes of varying diameters, as well as the membrane of a commercial MEMS microphone from ST-Microelectronics (MP23DB01HP), and compare their performance. To avoid confusion with other MEMS devices from literature, the commercial device is referred to as \u2018ST MEMS microphone\u2019 in the rest of the manuscript. In Fig. 3a, the frequency response of four graphene drums with a diameter d = 350 \u00b5m is shown together with the response of the ST MEMS microphone (d = 950 \u00b5m). Also, the mechanical sensitivity at 1 kHz (Sm,1 kHz) of the 37 measured drums is shown in Fig. S3 of the ESI.\u2020\nThis quantity is defined as Sm;1 kHz \u00bc \u0394z1 kHz\u0394P1 kHz where \u0394z1 kHz is the AC amplitude of the membrane centre at 1 kHz and \u0394P1 kHz is the input sound pressure amplitude at 1 kHz. Even though large differences in sensitivity between graphene membranes are observed, all graphene membranes exhibit much higher mechanical sensitivities (up to \u223c2000 nm Pa\u22121) than the ST MEMS microphone with Sm,1 kHz \u223c1.3 nm Pa\u22121.\nTo analyze these results, the data points in Fig. 3a were fit (drawn lines) using a harmonic oscillator model,\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023 Nanoscale, 2023, 15, 6343\u20136352 | 6345\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The low-frequency response (\u03c9 \u226a \u03c90), Sm\u00f00\u00de \u00bc R24n0 , can be calculated using the equation for the static displacement, z, of a circular membrane subjected to a uniform pressure load \u0394P:15\n\u0394P \u00bc 4n0 R2 z \u00fe 8Et 3R4\u00f01 \u03bd\u00de z 3; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere E is Young\u2019s modulus and \u03bd is the Poisson\u2019s ratio of the material. Thus, in the limit of small z, the mechanical sensitivity of the membrane can be expressed as Sm\u00f00\u00de z\u0394P \u00bc R2 4n0 . Even though it has a two to three times smaller diameter than the ST MEMS microphone, the mechanical sensitivity of the graphene membrane is extremely large thanks to its low pretension n0.\nAccording to eqn (1), the main parameter determining Sm(0) is the pretension. Thus, variation in sensitivity observed between the devices in Fig. 3 is likely due to fabrication induced differences in pretension. To check this hypothesis, we consider the equation for the fundamental resonance frequency, f0, of a circular membrane and its relation to the mechanical sensitivity Sm(0):\nf0 \u00bc 2:4052\u03c0R ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi n0 \u03c1eff t r \u00bc 2:405 4\u03c0 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 1 Sm\u00f00\u00de\u03c1eff t s ; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere \u03c1eff is the effective density of the membrane, which can be affected by air loading effects (see section 3 of the ESI\u2020). Since 1 kHz is below the resonance frequency of the membrane, Sm,1 kHz \u2248 Sm(0). Therefore, we expect to observe the following proportionality relation between mechanical sensitivity and resonance frequency: Sm \u221d f0\u22122.\nTo remove the influence of air loading effects on the resonance frequency, we also measure the membranes\u2019 resonance frequency in vacuum using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer (MSA400 Micro System Analyzer). The sample is placed inside a vacuum chamber (\u223c10\u22123 mbar) equipped with a piezo shaker to actuate the membrane. The displacement is measured over a user-defined grid of points distributed over the surface of the membrane. Thus the membrane mode shape can be reconstructed to identify the first resonance mode (see section 3 of the ESI for more details\u2020).\nIn Fig. 3b we plot the sensitivity at 1 kHz against f0 measured using a scanning LDV in vacuum. The data in Fig. 3b follows the theoretically expected relation Sm \u221d f0\u22122, showing that the experimental differences in sensitivity observed in Fig. 3b can indeed be well accounted for by variations in n0. Fig. S3b in the ESI,\u2020 shows correlations between mechanical sensitivity and resonance frequencies measured in air from data like in Fig. 3a. Variations in pretension can be caused by forces on the graphene during the transfer process, and might also be induced by wrinkles in the membranes (see Fig. S5 in the ESI\u2020).\nA high sensitivity does not automatically guarantee that a microphone can detect weak sounds, because its limit of detection (LOD) also depends on the noise level. To determine the LOD, we measured the membrane displacement at 1 kHz for different driving amplitudes to investigate the minimum detectable sound pressure level (SPL).

The vibration amplitude at 1 kHz as a function of the input SPL, as obtained from the peak heights in Fig. 4a using the vibrometer responsivity of 200 nm V\u22121, is shown in Fig. 4b for the four devices. The measured average noise level for each sample is depicted with a dashed line of the corresponding colour. For SPL > 30 dBSPL, the response peak at 1 kHz is visible in all samples with varying amplitudes depending on the sample\u2019s mechanical sensitivity. When decreasing the input SPL, the 1 kHz peak becomes comparable to the noise level at \u223c30\u201332 dBSPL for the ST MEMS microphone and G1, while for G4 and G6 the extrapolated signal stays above the noise level down to 25 and 15 dBSPL respectively, which is significantly lower than the lowest SPL of 70 dBSPL at which graphene membranes were tested in literature21 up to now. The extrapolated LOD of \u223c15 dBSPL of device G6 is even lower than the specified LOD of the reference microphone of 24 dBSPL used to measure the input SPL. Fig. 4b shows that the noise level increases when the sensitivity increases due to a smaller stiffness k, because the thermomechanical noise induces a mean displacement given by: , x2 >\u00bc kBT k .28 The thermomechanically induced displacement power spectral density below resonance Sxx;n \u00bc 4kBTkQ\u03c90 can be calculated by extracting k from a linear fit to Fig. 5b and Q and \u03c90 from a harmonic oscillator fit to the resonances in air, leading to a theoretical value of the thermomechanical noise displacement density pSxx,n of \u223c8, 1.8, 0.2 pm Hz\u22121 for sample G6, G4, G1 respectively. The noise level measured is \u223c47, 17, 5 and 3 pm Hz\u22121 for sample G6, G4, G1 and the ST MEMS respectively, showing that the displacement noise in the membranes is near, but not at the theoretical limit. To determine the microphone performance at high sound pressure levels, similar measurements were performed at high SPL to study the dynamic range, the distortion and nonlinearity of the response. In Fig. 5a we show the response amplitude\nFig. 4 Minimum detectable SPL.

The dashed lines show the average noise level (NL) of the corresponding samples. Peaks with amplitudes smaller than 1.1 \u00d7 NL were removed from the plot. A linear fit through the points from device G6 is also shown to determine the minimum detectable SPL by extrapolation (LOD \u223c15 dBSPL).\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023 Nanoscale, 2023, 15, 6343\u20136352 | 6347\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

On average, the noise level of the graphene membranes is higher compared to that of the ST MEMS microphone. However, due to their higher sensitivity at 94 dBSPL, the SNR (difference between blue and red data points in Fig. 5a) of the graphene microphones ranges from 80\u201395 dB, which is significantly larger than that of the ST MEMS microphone, which is 72 dB.\nIn Fig. 5b, we show the peak amplitude of the displacement signal in response to a 1 kHz tone between 50 dBSPL and 110 dBSPL. Louder acoustic signals were not used due to large distortion and clipping occurring in the speaker. All graphene samples exhibit a higher response than the ST MEMS microphone, but at a high SPL the most sensitive samples deviate from linear behaviour. This is to be expected as the linear approximation of eqn (2) holds in the limit of small displacements. Therefore, while sample G6 was the best at detecting low sound levels down to 20 dBSPL, its performance at high SPL gets worse due to non-linear effects limiting its dynamic\nrange. The non-linear response of G6 and G4 was fitted to eqn (2) with t = 8 nm, 2R = 350 \u00b5m and \u03bd = 0.26 yielding a pretension n0 \u223c7 mN m\u22121 and 33 mN m\u22121 and a Young\u2019s modulus of E \u223c5 GPa and 30 GPa for G6 and G4 respectively. The extracted Young\u2019s modulus is much lower than that of pristine graphene. This reduction could be due to defects that originate from graphene growth in the form of small holes of \u223c50 nm, as observed by SEM inspection of the samples (see Fig. S6 in ESI\u2020). In addition, transfer-induced wrinkles and slack in the membrane can further decrease the Young\u2019s modulus.29\nTo analyze the observed distortion, the spectrum of sample G6 in response to a 1 kHz tone with varying SPL at 1 kHz is shown in Fig. 5c. At higher SPL, harmonics of the driving frequency are visible in the spectrum.

The maximum SPL that a microphone can handle is determined by the acoustic overload point (AOP), which is usually defined as the pressure level at which the THD reaches 10%.30 The dynamic range is then given by the difference in dB between the AOP and minimum detectable SPL, which for MEMS devices is usually determined by the microphone\u2019s noise level. In the calculation of the THD of the membrane\u2019s displacement, contributions from harmonics generated by the speaker were subtracted. The extracted THD as a function of the input SPL is shown in Fig. 5d. Samples G6 and G4 reach the acoustic overload point at around 98 dBSPL and 110 dBSPL respectively, setting their dynamic range to \u223c83 dB and 87 dB. The other samples are well below the AOP at the maximum SPL applied so that their dynamic range is >85 dB. The measured THD at 110 dBSPL of the ST MEMS microphone is \u223c0.5%, in close agreement with the reported THD in its datasheet.31\nIn order to theoretically estimate the expected value of the THD, we assume periodic motion of the membrane z(t ) = z0 sin\u03c9t, which when substituted in eqn (2) yields\n\u0394P\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc \u03b1z0 \u00fe 34 \u03b2z0 3 sin \u03c9t \u03b2 4 z03 sin 3\u03c9t; \u00f05\u00de\nwhere \u03b1 \u00bc 4n0 R2 and \u03b2 \u00bc 8Et 3R4\u00f01 \u03bd\u00de . Using values of n0 and E from the fit to the non-linear response curves in Fig. 5b, we calculate the expected distortion just from the third harmonic as: THD3rd \u00bc \u03b2z0 2\n4\u03b1\u00fe \u03b2z02 . The resulting THD3rd for samples G6 and G4 at the maximum applied SPL of 110 dBSPL is 21.5% and 7.5% respectively. This is consistent with the measured values of 25% and 9.6% corresponding to THD from the first 5 harmonics, since the third harmonic is expected from eqn (2) to have the largest contribution to the THD."

In commercial applications, a microphone\u2019s signal is usually detected electrically via capacitive readout. In the capacitive configuration, the microphone\u2019s ability to pick up sound is described by its open circuit sensitivity, S, namely the ratio of the microphone\u2019s open circuit output voltage over the driving SPL in Pa. The open circuit sensitivity is given by the product of the microphone\u2019s electrical Se and mechanical Sm sensitivities as: 32\nS \u00bc SeSm \u00bc Vbg0 Sm; \u00f06\u00de\nwhere Vb is the bias voltage and g0 is the equilibrium gap distance between the capacitor plates. Using this formula we can further compare our membranes with MEMS devices reported in literature2 by extracting their mechanical sensitivity Sm from\npublished values of S, Vb and g0 using eqn (6). To have a more direct comparison between devices of different geometries/ dimensions, we divide the mechanical sensitivity by the area of the membrane which yields the membrane\u2019s mechanical compliance, Cm.\nFig. 6 shows the mechanical compliance as a function of membrane thickness for MEMS devices reported in ref. 2 (blue circles), for graphene-based microphones (red and purple hexagons), and for the multi-layer graphene (MLG) membranes presented here (green hexagon). The data points shown for the MLG membranes of our work include the membranes with highest and lowest compliance to highlight the range of measured values compared to previous reports in literature. The compliance of graphene-based membranes not listed in ref. 2 is estimated from the reported membrane pretension using Cm \u00bc 1k , where the membrane\u2019s stiffness k = 4\u03c0n0 in the case of pressure deformation.33 Moreover, since n0 = \u03c3t where \u03c3 is the pre-stress of the membrane, we can identify lines of constant stress in the Cm vs. t plane. These are highlighted as dashed red lines in Fig. 6 with lower stress corresponding to lower opacity of the line. The high mechanical sensitivity of our membranes can thus be attributed to a combination of low stress and small thickness. The high stress reported on the t = 25 nm membrane in ref. 20 results from the large polarization voltage of 200 V used to readout the acoustic signal, which led to an estimated pretension of 640 N m\u22121.\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023 Nanoscale, 2023, 15, 6343\u20136352 | 6349\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Therefore, the lower compliance in these devices (at atmospheric pressure) can be partly explained by the effect of squeeze film damping. The graphene membranes under study do not have such a backplate, because we first wanted to determine the intrinsic properties of the graphene membranes themselves. Realizing efficient electrical microphone readout, e.g. via a perforated capacitive backplate, while maintaining this high sensitivity and compliance is another challenge that is outside the scope of this work.\nAlthough lowering the tension and stiffness of graphene membranes helps to improve their acoustic sensitivity, a drawback is that it reduces the fundamental resonance frequency, thus limiting the microphone bandwidth (Fig. 3b). Since the mass of the graphene membranes is extremely low, and their aspect-ratio very high (d/t \u223c46 000), the mass of the air that moves along with the membrane is substantial, increasing the effective membrane mass meff.\n34,35 This mass increase further reduces the resonance frequency and bandwidth. Initial experiments showed a 5 to 9-fold decrease of the resonant frequency from vacuum \u223c10\u22124 mbar to atmospheric conditions (see Fig. S4 in the ESI\u2020). Further pressure-dependent measurements are needed to understand better this air mass loading effect as well as the importance of squeeze-film damping on future devices with backplate for capacitive readout.\nIn general, it is desirable to have the resonance frequency of the membrane above the audible range (>20 kHz). The membranes in this work, like in several other graphene microphone publications,18,22,23 do not satisfy this condition. However, it is important to note that depending on the target application, a bandwidth of 6\u201310 kHz can be sufficient,22,36 therefore the reported low resonance frequency (<10 kHz) of graphene membranes is not necessarily limiting for their performance. Nevertheless, this problem could be compensated for in next generation devices by increasing their pretension n0 or reducing the membrane radius R, while keeping competitive mechanical sensitivity. For example, as shown in ref. 37 graphene membranes with diameters of 85\u2013150 \u00b5m exhibit resonance frequencies in vacuum of 250\u2013320 kHz and mechanical sensitivities still comparable to a MEMS membrane with a diameter of 950 \u00b5m. For a fairer comparison, one can correct the obtained compliances in Fig. 6 by a factor (20 kHz/f0)\n2. Even after such a correction, the compliances obtained by the graphene membranes in this work are higher than most literature values as shown in Fig. S7 in the ESI.\u2020\nA main challenge in using graphene as a microphone is linked to the lack of control over its mechanical properties during the transfer process, which limits the reproducibility of the membrane\u2019s performance as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S3.\u2020 For microphone applications, large sheets of suspended CVD graphene are needed and thus a transfer step to the target substrate has been unavoidable in all previous studies. In addition to the poor uniformity and control of strain, the transfer process can degrade the quality of the graphene by introducing contamination, cracks and wrinkles, unwanted for practical\napplication and large-scale production.38 In a recent study,37 wafer-scale fabrication of multilayer graphene membranes was achieved using a transfer-free method, by which the graphene is grown and released directly on the target substrate. This novel method could prove beneficial in terms of uniformity and scalability in fabrication of graphene-based microphones and sensors.\nFinally, the most sensitive membranes are found to be more influenced by non-linear effects at high SPL, and exhibit higher distortion and reduced dynamic range. Graphene membranes cannot yet reach commercial values of THD, acoustic overload point (AOP = 140 dBSPL) and dynamic range (105 dBSPL\n31), also because they do not feature a doublebackplate configuration for differential readout which greatly reduces the THD and increases sensitivity.36 The trade-off between sensitivity and dynamic range could be further optimized by better control over the membrane\u2019s stiffness."

            "text": "In this work, evidence is provided that, with proper design, graphene-based devices have the potential to outperform existing microphones. In terms of mechanical sensitivity and SNR, graphene is superior to commercial Si-based membranes and MEMS devices from literature by a large margin, yielding an improvement of more than 2 orders of magnitude in sensitivity. In addition we show that the detection limit of graphene membranes is as low as 15 dBSPL for membranes with a diameter of only 350 \u00b5m. On the other hand, due to the low stiffness and the large contribution of air loading, the membrane\u2019s bandwidth is found to be limited at <10 kHz on most samples. However, we show that even when taking this factor into account, the membranes in this work are still more performant than commercial devices. We propose that given the high sensitivity of graphene one can further reduce the sensor\u2019s dimensions, increasing its resonance frequency, bandwidth and mechanical strength. Smaller sized membranes would also facilitate the implementation of arrays of membranes in parallel to increase SNR36 or directionality and reduce effects of added air as well as squeeze film damping in closed cavity resonators with capacitive readout.39 Therefore, we believe that graphene can indeed improve current microphone devices and that the main disadvantage and barrier to real applications lies in the lack of a more controllable fabrication method to suspend graphene membranes."
