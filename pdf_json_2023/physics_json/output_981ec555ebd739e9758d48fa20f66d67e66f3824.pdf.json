    "abstractText": "Aqueous extract of fruit obtained from Ficus racemosa enriched with phenolic components was used for the first time to fabricate chitosan (CS) and sodium alginate (SA)-based edible films. The edible films supplemented with Ficus fruit aqueous extract (FFE) were characterized physiochemically (using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Texture analyser (TA), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and colourimeter) and biologically (using antioxidant assays). CS\u2013SA\u2013FFA films showed high thermal stability and high antioxidant properties. The addition of FFA into CS\u2013SA film decreased transparency, crystallinity, tensile strength (TS), and water vapour permeability (WVP) but ameliorate moisture content (MC), elongation at break (EAB) and film thickness. The overall increase in thermal stability and antioxidant property of CS\u2013SA\u2013FFA films demonstrated that FFA could be alternatively used as a potent natural plant-based extract for the development of food packaging material with improved physicochemical and antioxidant properties.",

            "text": "Petroleum-based films are one of the factors contributing to the dramatic rise in pollution over the past few decades, and several health problems are linked to using plastics as food packaging material. To overcome these challenges, edible films prepared from natural polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins or their combinations have gained much attention during the last few years. Polysaccharides have several potential uses in edible film preparations because of their nontoxic nature, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and processibility. Chitosan is a cationic polysaccharide that has been used in film fabrication due to its excellent film-forming properties [1,2]. However, due to its innate hydrophilicity, pure chitosan films have low water resistance. Furthermore, it is challenging to form chitosan-based edible films with desirable mechanical properties, which restricts their applicability in the fabrication of films [3]. Therefore, a variety of approaches have been suggested to address these problems and enhance the qualities of chitosan-based materials,\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1215. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15051215 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1215 2 of 14\nincluding surface coating [4], crosslinking [5], enzyme treatment [6], and combining them with other natural polymers [7]. Sodium alginate is an inexpensive hydrocolloid that is safe to use, biodegradable and biocompatible, and provides a strong film structure in food packaging applications [8]. Both chitosan and sodium alginate are macromolecules safe for human consumption and can be combined to fabricate edible films with the most desirable properties [9]. Moreover, biopolymer films are promising carriers for different bioactive components, such as plant extracts, antioxidants, and antimicrobial agents. Extensive research has been conducted on the cluster fig tree, scientifically known as Ficus racemosa (Moraceae), due to its various health-promoting properties and nutritional aspects. The fruit of Ficus racemosa contains several pharmacologically active compounds such as glauanol, hentriacontane, -sitosterol, tiglic acid, -sitosterol, cycloartenol, cycloeuphordenol, euphol, euphorbinol, isoeuphorbol, and palmitic acid as evidenced by various studies [10]. In different studies, the fruit extract of Ficus racemosa has shown various biological activities such as hypoglycaemic, antioxidant, gastroprotective, and anti-filarial activity [11\u201313]. Different studies have demonstrated the safety and nontoxicity of Ficus racemosa fruit extract [13,14]. The incorporation of naturally occurring sources of antioxidants and antimicrobials in edible films such as plant extracts has been studied extensively. According to the findings of several studies, the incorporation of a variety of fruit extracts into edible films enhances the antioxidant activity of the films [15]. Chitosan-based edible films were prepared with the addition of Berberis crataegina fruit extract. Compared to other films, the film containing fruit extract showed improved thermal stability and antioxidant and antibacterial activities [16]. Despite its high food and medicinal potential, so far, aqueous fruit extract of F. racemosa has not been used in edible films to study its impact on its physiochemical characteristics. As a result, the purpose of the current study is to examine the physiochemical properties and antioxidant potential of the chitosan\u2013sodium alginate-based edible films incorporated with Ficus racemosa fruit aqueous extract (FFE)."

Initially, 1% (w/v) CS solution was prepared by dissolving the polymer in 1% (v/v) acetic acid solution. Similarly, 3% (w/v) SA solution was prepared by dissolving the polymer in distilled water. Then, both solutions were mixed thoroughly in a beaker with the help of a magnetic stirrer. Following the solubilization of CS and SA, the solution was divided equally and transferred to four separate beakers (50 mL) labelled FC1\u2013FC4. 5% glycerol was added to the film-forming solution as a plasticizer. The first beaker (FC-1) contained the CS\u2013SA film-forming solution with 5% glycerol (v/v) and was considered the control sample in the current study. The second, third, and fourth beakers, labelled as FC-2, FC-3, and FC-4, contained 5% glycerol (v/v) film-forming solution and 0.5, 1, and 1.5% FFE, respectively.

The results of our study are corroborated with the findings of Nemazifard et al.

In the current study, an increase in the moisture content among FC-1\u2013FC-4 samples was observed due to the incorporation of the FFE (Table 2). The maximum (34.82%) and minimum (24.16%) moisture content was found in FC-4 and control, respectively. This could be due to the hydrophilic nature of the polymers as well as the extract added. Recent studies have shown that adding plant extracts in biopolymer-based films enhances their water moisture and solubility [25]. In a previous study, conducted by Augusto et al. [26], the researchers found that the incorporation of Codium tomentosum seaweed extract led to an increase in the amount of moisture present in edible films based on chitosan and alginate. The water solubility of the CS\u2013SA-based edible film samples showed 100% values for all the film samples. This behaviour could be ascribed to the hydrophilic nature of the film-forming components, including chitosan and sodium alginate, as well as FFE."

Ideally, food packaging materials should have lower WVP values, thereby reducing food spoilage [22]. The results for the WVP of tested film samples have been presented in Table 2. The WVP value of the control film sample (0.356) was greater than the samples with the added extract. The lowest water permeability was observed in FC-4 (0.333), followed by FC-3 (0.337) and FC-2 (0.348). A decline in the WVP was observed with an increase in the concentration of the FFE. This behaviour could be due to good intermolecular interaction between the filmforming components with the addition of FFE. The findings of our study are in line with Tal\u00f3n et al.

The maximum transparency was observed in the control (FC-1) sample (80.45%). The lowest transparency was shown by FC-4 (46.427%) loaded with the highest concentration (1.5%) of FFE.

The colour parameters of the FC-4 sample with a maximum concentration (1.5%) of FFE shifted from transparent to blue-yellow (b*). The control sample (FC-1) was more evident as compared to samples with extract added (Table 3). Adding the FFE slightly decreased the lightness (L*) of the film samples. The current study results demonstrate that adding FFE significantly affected the colour parameters of the film samples. Zhang et al.

The examined film samples exhibited similar cycles of weight loss in the TG curve (Figure 1). In the temperature range of 35 to 130 \u25e6 C, the occurrence of first thermal degradation could be associated with water evaporation [2]. A weight loss of approximately 10% was observed during the first stage in all the samples, excluding the control (FC-1), which had a relatively dramatic weight loss compared to the other samples. This weight loss could be due to the thermal degradation of polymers having low intermolecular interaction as the addition of FFE would have improved the interaction among the polymers [31]. The second weight loss phase was observed for all samples between 150 and 400 \u25e6C. It could be due to the thermal degradation of film-forming components, including sodium alginate, chitosan, glycerol, and FFE. According to reports, glycerol-rich material, chitosan, and sodium alginate break down between 150\u2013260 \u25e6C, 240\u2013360 \u25e6C, and 229\u2013243 \u25e6C, respectively [32\u201334]. The FC-4 sample with 1.5% extract showed good thermal stability compared to the control, FC-2, and FC-3.

These structural discontinuities in the FC-1 sample align with the findings of Li et al.

Previous studies have demonstrated that pores and tiny particles on the surface significantly affect the mechanical and barrier characteristics of films [39].

Thus, based on th prese t findings, FC-4 was more suitable f r food packaging. However, further research is required to improv its tensile strength and transparency without impacting its physiochemical roperties.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.B. and .A.S.; ethodology, .J., .S. .- . and S.U.; software.
