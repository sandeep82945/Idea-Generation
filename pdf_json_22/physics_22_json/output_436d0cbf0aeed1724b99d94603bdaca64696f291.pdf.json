In principle, there are two options. For many applications, lasers based on III-V compounds provide compelling solutions, even if the integration is complex and therefore costly. However, where low costs and also high integration density are crucial, group-IV-based lasers\u2014made of Ge and GeSn, for example\u2014could be an alternative, provided their performance can be improved. Such progress will come with better materials but also with the development of a more profound understanding of their optical properties. In this work, we demonstrate, using Ge microbridges with strain up to 6.6%, a powerful method for determining the population inversion gain and the material and optical losses of group IV lasers. This is done by deriving the values for the injection carrier densities and the cavity losses from the measurement of the change of the refractive index and the mode linewidth, respectively. We observe a laser threshold consistent with optical gain. Material loss values are obtained from a tight-binding calculation. Lasing in Ge\u2014at steady-state\u2014is found to be limited to low temperatures in a narrow regime of tensile strain at the crossover to the direct-band-gap band structure. We explain this observation by parasitic inter-valence-band absorption that increases rapidly with higher injection densities and temperature. N-doping seems to reduce the material loss at low excitation, but it does not extend the lasing regime. We also discuss the impact of the optically inactive carriers in the L-valley on the linewidth of group IV lasers.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.033050\nI. INTRODUCTION\nToday, germanium-based materials, strained [1] or alloyed with Sn [2,3], form the most advanced platform for groupIV lasing. However, despite encouraging results [4\u201315], all group-IV lasing performances are behind those of group IIIV based lasers integrated on silicon using direct growth on prepatterned [16] or planar layers of quantum dots [17,18], quantum wells [19] or quantum-cascade structures [20]. There is definitely the possibility to close this gap by improving the materials and strengthening the knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms relevant for lasing in group IV. For the latter, we miss a coherent description of the dependence of lasing performances on the band offset and doping. It is also essential to understand the role of parasitic losses, such as the intervalence-band (IVB) absorption [21] and its dependence on the carrier injection and temperature. Moreover, even essential details of the band structure, such as the band offset between\n*francesco.tap@gmail.com \u2020hans.sigg@psi.ch\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

To improve the performance of group IV lasers, this would have to be known precisely.\nHere, we address these points for the strained Ge system, where we can benefit from thoroughly developed tools to calculate band structure [24] and properties relevant for transport [25] and lasing [26,27]. Moreover, Ge is attractive not only for laser benchmarking, but also because of its recent use in quantum technology as a spin qubit [28\u201330]. The possibility to fabricate from the same material quantum gates as well as a laser source provides further motivation for this study.\nThe bottleneck that must be overcome to achieve lasing action with pristine Ge is the low population of carriers at the center of the Brillouin zone ( ), where optical transitions are allowed. Being an indirect semiconductor, Ge differs from standard direct-band-gap semiconductors such as GaAs, where basically only such states are occupied. There are two approaches to enhance the carrier population at in Ge: (i) The initial proposal suggested to use strong n-doping with phosphorus [31]. However, the related experiments showed contradictory results. Whereas the photoluminescence [32] and electroluminescence [33,34] from optical cavities made of such highly doped Ge had been attributed to lasing, the absorption studied under optical pumping on similar material in Refs. [35,36] did not reveal the net gain required for lasing. Alternatively, by applying tensile strain, (ii) we can control\n2643-1564/2022/4(3)/033050(17) 033050-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nthe population at the -point by gradually closing the offset between the band edge at the - and L-points until we have reached and even passed the crossover to the direct band gap, where\u2014in a situation similar to that of GaAs\u2014the lowest energy states in are below those of L. Then, population inversion between the relevant states and thus lasing become possible.\nTo systematically investigate this transition regime from an indirect to a direct semiconductor, we make use of the recently developed strain amplification approach [37,38]. It enables us to study the evolution of lasing\u2014using the same doped or undoped base material\u2014as a function of just the strain. Lasing under tensile strain has also been investigated for the GeSn system [9,12], however its dependence on the strain has not been systematically studied.\nThe organization of the paper follows our experimental approach: we first describe the strain amplification concept [37,38] used to produce a series of high-quality optical cavities with strain up to 4.2% at room temperature, reaching up to 6.6% at low temperature. For all samples, the low-temperature photoluminescence spectra of the cavity modes are investigated in dependence on the excitation power, i.e., the carrier density. The latter was determined from the plasma shift of the dielectric function. We infer the strain from matching the experimental band gap to the calculated band structure obtained using the tight-binding (TB) approach [24]. With the same model, we compute the matrix elements needed for\nthe interband gain and the intra-valence-band material loss calculation. We show that by choosing appropriate values for the carrier temperature and line broadening, as well as the cavity losses, the TB-model accurately predicts lasing thresholds for samples with approximately 6% of strain for excitation around 2\u00d71018 cm\u22123. The model also explains the observed lasing rollover at higher excitations and when the cryostat temperature exceeds 30 K. Via the analysis of the cavity modes\u2019 linewidth\u2014similarly to the work of Petykiewicz et al. [39]\u2014we deduce the cavity quality factor and we gather an overall understanding of the gain and loss mechanism in our tensile strained Ge cavities. We then pin down the crossover to a direct band gap for uniaxially strained Ge at 6.1%. In the final experimental sections, we study the mode linewidth of moderately n-type doped material with high strain, and we discuss a peculiar deviation of the usual Schawlow-Townes laser linewidth theory [40] for the case of only modestly direct-band-gap group IV lasers."

            "text": "In this experiment, we study the optical properties at low temperatures of highly strained Ge microbridges that are suspended and embedded into an optical cavity. The high strain is achieved by patterning along \u3008100\u3009 and selectively underetching a GeOI layer with a builtin biaxial tensile strain \u03b50 of 0.16%. The layers were undoped or doped in situ by\n033050-2\nphosphorus. The strain amplification method has been explained in detail in [37,1,41]. We employed samples with notations L5, L6, L7 on chip A and L9, L10, L11 on chip B obtained from two consecutive processing runs. The labels indicate structures with progressively increasing total pad length L (c.f. Fig. 1(a)) in the range of 280 \u03bcm to 400 \u03bcm. The length L determines the uniaxial tensile strain, which ranges from 3.7 up to 4.2% at room temperature (RT) as measured via Raman scattering. The strained microbridge of length lb = 8 \u03bcm is integrated in a strain-maintaining optical cavity with two corner cube reflectors, at a distance lc = 44 \u03bcm. The cavity is shown in Fig. 1(b), together with the optical mode pattern as calculated with Comsol Multi Physics.\nThe microbridge structures are mounted in a cryostat with a base temperature of 15 K, and they are excited with a diode laser running in continuous wave with an energy of h\u03bdext = 590 meV (\u03bb = 2.15 \u03bcm) and an excitation diameter (i.e., a full width at half-maximum) of about 8.7 \u03bcm. The photon energy of the excitation is well below the band gap of unstrained Ge to guarantee low loss in the pad region, which is essentially unstrained. Throughout this paper, the reported excitation power is defined as the total power at the sample position. Due to the excellent thermal conductivity of Ge at low temperature (1.7 kW/mK at 15 K), the temperature increase of the samples is less than 10 K at the excitation of 10 mW, even when considering a possible reduction of the thermal conductivity by one order of magnitude due to the structure\u2019s finite size. The optical spectra are recorded via a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Bruker Vertex 70) running in the fast scanning mode with an instrumental resolution of 0.5 cm\u22121, corresponding to 62 \u03bceV.\nThe low-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra of samples L5\u2013L11 are reported in Fig. 1(c). Each of the samples shows a broad spontaneous emission strongly modulated by Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity modes. The higher the strain of the sample, the lower is the PL energy. Compared to RT\u2014cf. Appendix A\u2014the PL onset is redshifted, in line with a tensile strain increase when cooling the samples [41]. We converted the measured PL signal to the spectral power of light collected by the microscope using the calibration procedure described in [1]. This procedure could not be applied for L7 because of a misaligned detector. Its spectral power was adjusted by an arbitrary factor of 2.5 for better visibility in Fig. 1(c). Figure 1(d) reports the -VB1 band-gap energy dependence on strain at low temperature as obtained from the tight-binding (TB) simulations [24,1]. As per Fig. 1(d), we deduce the strain of the samples from the position of the band gap. This approach was verified previously by Guilloy et al. [22] via electromodulation spectroscopy on similar microbridges with strain up to 3.3% calibrated by x-ray microdiffraction [42]. Here, we relate the band gap to the photon energy at the half-maximum spectral intensity of the photoluminescence background; cf. the x-axis of Fig. 1(c). This simple method is particularly well suited in the case of strong cavity modes. Corresponding strain values are summarized in Table I.\nFrom the correlation of the PL spectra with Raman measurements taken at room temperature, cf. Appendix A, we obtain that the thus defined band-gap values fit nicely the strain dependence of the TB model up to 4.2%."

            "text": "Figures 2(a)\u20132(e) show a series of power-dependent cavityPL spectra taken at 15 K for samples L5, L6, and L7*, L9, L10, and L11. The sample denoted as L7* belongs to chip B. It has the geometry of L9 but the PL spectra characteristics and onset of the L7 cavities of chip A; cf. Appendix B. We may thus safely assume that the strain of that particular sample L9, henceforth referred to as L7*, is the same as for L7. To enable measurements under identical conditions on a series of differently strained samples, we use in the following the results of L7* together with L9, L10, and L11.\nSamples are excited up to 15 mW, corresponding to a carrier density of about 3.7\u00d71018 cm\u22123. This conversion is based on the observed frequency shift of the cavity modes induced by the electron-hole plasma dispersion effect, as shown in Appendix C. The factor of 0.25\u00d71018 cm\u22123/mW is found to be valid for all samples. This value corresponds roughly to a case with an absorbed fraction and a recombination time of 40% and 5 ns, respectively. The latter is in agreement with the surface recombination time found in a previous pump probe study of the 2-\u03bcm-thick GeOI source material used here [43], while the 40% is a fair estimate for strained Ge when considering the cavity effect created by multiple reflections within the bridge and via the Si substrate.\nThe spectra shown in Fig. 2 can be grouped in three strain ranges. For the lowest strains, Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), the spectra show a broad photoluminescence background modulated by Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity modes. For intermediate strains, the spectral emissions of L7* and L9 in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d) show a similar combination of background and multimode emission, but only up to about 6 mW excitation. Above about 9 mW, there is a single-mode peak in the PL spectra of L7* and L9: its spectral peak intensity sharply increases by about two to three orders of magnitude above the spontaneous emission background. Remarkably, for the highest strains, Figs. 2(e) and 2(f), the spectra of L10 and L11 are again multimode up to the highest excitation power.\nThe emission obtained for the samples with intermediate strains not only exhibits a single mode, but it also reveals a steep increase of the total emitted power, as shown in Fig. 3(a), clearly demonstrating lasing action in L7* and L9. Conversely, L5 and L6 as well as L10 and L11, the samples with the lowest and the highest strains, do not lase, as neither single-mode operation nor a noticeable increase of emission efficiency is observed.\nFrom the intersection between the linearly extrapolated PL emission at high and low excitation power shown in Fig. 3(a), threshold powers of 9.6 and 8.6 mW for, respectively, L7*\u2014 as well as L7 shown in Appendix B\u2014and L9 are obtained. These values, using the above-mentioned conversion factor, correspond to a carrier density Nth = 2.4(2.1)\u00d71018 cm\u22123 for\n033050-3\nL7* (L9). For both samples, the linear increase in the emitted intensity is followed by a striking rollover. For L9, the rollover point occurs at an excitation power lower than for L7*.\nIn Fig. 3(b), we show the light-in light-out curves of lasing sample L9 as a function of temperature in linear scale. The temperature is increased in steps of 5 K from 15 up to 35 K. By raising the temperature, the lasing efficiency rapidly degrades until at 35 K the lasing is suppressed. This behavior, together with the rollover at higher excitation as well as the threshold values of L7* and L9 near 2\u00d71018 cm\u22123, conforms to the predictions detailed in the following."

            "text": "Figure 4(a) represents the band structure of germanium under a uniaxially loaded tensile strain of 6% (shown in orange) when E , the offset between the and the L band edges, is practically zero. The blue lines represent the band structure for relaxed Ge when the strain is zero and E is about 140 meV. Details of the used tight-binding model are given in Ref. [24]. The strongest optical transitions are indicated by the green and red arrows representing, respectively, the interband transitions providing gain and the intervalence band (IVB) transitions responsible for the main material loss, \u03b1m. Figure 4(b) shows\ngain spectra for the barely direct-band-gap case with E = \u22123 meV and carrier density up to 5\u00d71018 cm\u22123. We give further details about the optical gain model in Appendix D.\nCarrier temperature and state broadening for this calculation are set to 30 K and 10 meV, respectively. The latter comes from a previous IVB absorption study of doped Ge [44] at low temperature. As no corresponding study was made for the interband excitation, its state broadening is assumed to be the same for simplicity. The carrier temperature is expected to be higher than the base temperature set for the cryostat and possibly also above that of the phonon bath, because carriers can be heated by the injection and might be out of equilibrium, albeit only weakly. However, as a change of the base temperature by only 20 K\u2014as demonstrated in Fig. 3(b)\u2014is able to switch off the lasing, we know that the heating of the carriers by injection is low and will not exceed 30 K at the 15 K base temperature, as we will conclude later.\nThe open circles shown in Fig. 4(b) mark the peak gain for a selection of excitation densities. While the peak gain is shifting to higher energies with increasing excitation, a transparency band with zero absorption develops at the high-energy side of the spectra. This behavior is typical for marginally direct systems; it can be attributed to the filling of the lowest valence-band states near by a large num-\n033050-4\nber of holes, while most of the excited electrons are in the L-conduction band. Figure 4(c) shows the IVB loss spectra (\u03b1m) for several excitation densities assuming the same carrier temperature and state broadening. Curves are tagged by open squares at the photon energy corresponding to the peak gain at the same carrier density. The IVB absorption strongly increases for decreasing energies, and its high-energy tail is characterized by a rapid increase for carrier densities and temperatures above 2\u00d71018 cm\u22123 and 30 K, respectively. Details of our IVB absorption model are presented in Appendix E together with an analysis of its dependence on temperature and state broadening. The rapid increase of the IVB absorption is due to holes filling the states farther apart from the point in reciprocal space; cf. Fig. 4(a). The strongest contribution comes from the transitions between VB1 and VB2, as indicated by the red arrow in Fig. 4(a). The transitions from VB1 to the split-off (VB3) occur at energies\nlarger than 650 meV and thus are not relevant in the present case.\nFigure 4(d) shows the dependence on the excitation density of the peak gain (blue curve) and the corresponding loss (blue dashed curve) at 30 K. Lasing is expected when the modal gain overcomes the total loss, which includes material and optical or cavity loss, \u03b1c. The latter is experimentally found to be 103 cm\u22121, as detailed in the next section. The material loss can be extracted from Fig. 4(c). It has to be evaluated at the emission energy where the gain is maximal, as indicated by the open squares. We show in Fig. 4(d) the case of a marginally direct band structure, with an offset E = \u22123 meV. In this case, the gain overcomes the total loss at an injection density of about 2\u00d71018 cm\u22123. For zero offset (not shown), the gain does not overcome the IVB loss anymore, demonstrating that the offset E is the main parameter driving the gain at the low temperatures probed here. Optical broadening and effective carrier temperature also have some impact on gain and loss,\n033050-5\nbut only marginally. We observe that, for any combination of optical broadening and effective temperature variation in the range of \u00b15 meV and \u00b115 K, respectively, the offset at which the gain may overcome the loss shifts by less than \u00b12 meV. However, we reach the best overall agreement with the experiments with the above values of broadening and temperature.\nDue to the fast-growing IVB absorption with density and temperature, lasing is achieved neither at higher excitation nor at elevated temperature. As shown in Fig. 4(d), the low temperature loss curve (blue dashed line) overcomes the gain at around 3\u00d71018 cm\u22123. At 50 K, the gain (red solid line) does not prevail over the loss (red dashed line). Both predictions are in good agreement with the experiments presented in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b).\nIn fact, by considering in our gain calculation the offset E as a free parameter and shifting the gain spectrum to the experimental PL onset, the observed lasing threshold is reproduced for E = \u22121.5 meV (L7*) and \u22122.5 meV (L9).\nWe will show below that we can understand with our model\u2014keeping the values of the parameter the same\u2014the lack of lasing in L10 and L11, but only when considering that the strain dependence of the directness is smaller than anticipated from the TB model [24]."

            "text": "In Fig. 5(a), we show the linewidth evolution with respect to the excitation power of the L9 cavity modes labelled in Fig. 5(b). The reported linewidths (h\u03bd) are apodized. We identify three regimes: (i) The linewidth of modes 1\u20134 narrows because of the gain. In line with the assumption that lasing occurs at the gain peak, the lasing mode, labeled as 1, narrows the most. (ii) The linewidths of the high-energy modes 5 and 6 are largely independent of the input power. Their values scatter around 0.45 meV. We relate this effect to transparency, as detailed in the next paragraph. (iii) Near and above lasing threshold, the linewidth levels off. The nonlasing modes from 2 to 4 saturate at 0.20 meV. This behavior can be well understood from the Fermi level pinning when lasing occurs.\n(iv) Unexpectedly, also the lasing mode 1 does not narrow but saturates at about 0.15 meV, well above the spectral resolution of our experiment. In principle, such behavior could come from mecanical vibrations of the floating nanocavities, which would periodically shift the cavity\u2019s resonant position and thus would lead to a peaked noise spectrum [45]. However, the noise spectrum observed for L7* when lasing is found to be flat. We thus attribute the finite laser linewidth to refractive index fluctuation induced by the carriers in the L-valley and multimode lasing on nearly degenerate modes; cf. Sec. VII.\nVia the observation of (ii), we gain access to cavity loss. In line with our Fig. 4(b) gain calculation, a wide transparency band (i.e., zero absorption) occurs for transitions with energies above the gain region. We make use of this characteristic behavior and translate the 0.45 meV linewidth of modes 5 and 6 into a cavity loss \u03b1c. From \u03bd = 1/(2\u03c0\u03c4 ), where \u03c4 is the photon decaying time, equal to \u03c4 = ng/(c\u03b1c), where ng is the group refractive index, we get \u03b1c \u2248 103 cm\u22121. This procedure is well supported by the observation that all samples, save the highest strained sample L11, have high-energy mode linewidths saturating at about 0.45 meV. Intrinsic material losses, such as the parasitic free carrier and IVB absorption, are largely negligible at high energies, in line with our model.\nFrom the standard threshold condition, exp( xygthlb) exp(\u2212\u03b1clc)exp(\u2212 xy\u03b1mlb) = 1, where xy = 0.94 is the transversal confinement factor, gth is the material gain at threshold, lb = 8 \u03bcm is the active material length, and lc = 44 \u03bcm is the length of the cavity, we can deduce that the active material delivers at threshold a gain of gth = \u22121xy \u03b1clc/lb + \u03b1m.\nThe gain required to start lasing is thus quite significant due to the low filling factor xylb/lc = 0.17 of the active material. Even without any material loss, the necessary gain for lasing is thus 600 cm\u22121.\nThe differential gain is obtained via the slope of the linewidth narrowing starting from transparency up to the excitation power corresponding to a reference density of Nr = 1018 cm\u22123. Up to this density, the IVB absorption increase is linear. We consider the mode showing the strongest\n033050-6\nreduction, which is obviously the lasing mode for L7* and L9. For the latter, this is shown as a dashed light-blue line in Fig. 5(a). We then convert the slope to the differential net gain using the linewidth definition in units of energy (h\u03bd) = hc\u03b1/(2\u03c0ng). For L9, we find dg/dN = 4.33\u00d710\u221216 cm2, which is close indeed to the calculated value of g(Nr )/(Nr \u2212 N0) = 4.70\u00d710\u221216 cm2, as obtained for the offset value of E = \u22122.5 meV derived by correlating the calculated to the measured Nth. N0 corresponds to the carrier density at transparency. Moreover, for L7*, the offset value determined from the linewidth/gain analyses is in close agreement with E obtained from threshold density analyses. These conformities give confidence in the slope based offset determination of the nonlasing samples, L5, L6, L10, and L11. Values are given in Table II together with the deduced linewidth reduction per mW of excitation. The corresponding linewidth analyses for L9, L10, and L11 are detailed in Appendix F, together with the linewidth excitation dependence obtained for these samples at T = 30 K. To circumvent possible issues because the gain may increase nonlinearly near transparency, in particular for L10 and L11, the excitation density corresponding to a reference linewidth value of L9 is used for an alternative offset determination. Again, the resulting offsets\u2014cf. Table II\u2014are in close agreement with the ones based on the slope method. For an overview of the three methods to obtain the E from the threshold and/or the experimental linewidth reduction, we refer the reader to Appendix G.\nWhile the experimental offset values agree among each other, the comparison to the model is striking. First, by interpolation of E between L6 and L11, we obtain that the crossover occurs for a uniaxial tensile strain of 6.05%. This is in excellent agreement with the model. In contrast, the dependence of the offset on strain differs considerably: we obtain that the experimental slope is smaller than predicted by almost a factor of 2. The slope determination may be (i) affected by the simplifications made in the modeling of gain and IVB absorption, or (ii) impacted by technical issues, such as material quality imperfection or bridge distortion, which\nmay introduce a nonuniaxial component of stress. We address some of these points in Appendix I. In principle, of course, it would also be possible (iii) that the theory is inaccurate with respect to the slope. To prove this, the offset would have to be measured not only near the crossing at around 6% of strain, but also at medium strain, about 3%. Photoreflection measurements [46] could be the most suitable method here. Despite these unresolved discrepancies between experiment and model, we are confident about the determination of the crossover, since it is based on the observation of lasing at low temperatures. The crossover determination by means of the analysis of the temperature dependence of the PL intensity\u2014 as presented in Ref. [47] for the case of strained Ge\u2014thus turns out to be inaccurate in retrospect.\nVI. N-DOPING\nWe now examine the PL of strained microbridge cavities made of in situ doped Ge, with phosphorus (P) concentrations of 1.8 and 6.3\u00d71018 cm\u22123. We refer to these samples as low doping (LD) and high doping (HD) samples, respectively. The strain, as inferred from the onset of the PL, is about 5.8%, similar to that of the undoped microbridge sample L6. PL results are shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b). The doped samples do not lase. However, compared to the spectra of L6 shown in Fig. 2, cavity modes already develop at low power, and the lines narrow fast with the excitation power; cf. Fig. 6(c). However, as the linewidth saturation also sets in already at low power, both doped samples seem far from reaching the lasing threshold. Lasing seems even further away than for L6, as found by comparing the LD and HD spectra at the highest power in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) and the corresponding one shown in Fig. 2(b).\nThe linewidth slope method yields an offset for both doped samples that is negative, namely \u22126.5 and \u221210 meV, respectively. In fact, for the higher doped sample, the slope shown in Fig. 6(c) is only a lower limit, as the linewidth was already of 0.3 meV at 2 mW excitation. Thus, compared to the 2.0 meV offset for L6, phosphorus doping seems to reduce\n033050-7\nE by about 8.5 meV and more than 12 meV for the LD and HD samples, respectively. Interestingly, these numbers are in reasonable agreement with the Fermi level positions in the L conduction band of the LD and HD samples, namely 8.4 and 20 meV, respectively.\nWe thus seem to have obtained by n-doping a system that becomes quasidirect, as we determine offset values that are negative. However, for higher excitation, the gain does not develop further and thus it does not overcome the optical loss, particularly in the high doping case. The most likely explanation for the reduction of the gain at high excitation is a strong reduction of the lifetime caused by the Auger effect. This explanation is consistent with the observation of the positions of the cavity modes, which shift more and more slowly for the doped samples at increasingly higher excitation density. Alternatively, the gain may not be pure interband, but it may be related to donor- to valence-band transitions that change their character from L to when the two conduction bands align. Such band tail states [48] may give a weak but insufficient gain."

            "text": "For the characterization of the laser linewidth, we focus on sample L7*. The laser resonance of L9 overlaps with an absorption band in air which complicates the linewidth analyses. Examples of the measured laser line spectra of L7* are shown in Appendix H, together with the fit function that consists of Lorentzian broadened lines.\nFor the discussion, we follow the standard model of Schawlow-Townes (ST) [40], which describes the linewidth of a single-mode laser above threshold as \u03bd = \u03b7ST(1 + \u03b12)/Pout, where Pout is the radiated power per round trip. The factor \u03b7ST depends on the amount of gain at threshold, the cavity loss, and the degree of population inversion [40]. The linewidth enhancement factor \u03b1 describes the coupling between intensity and phase noise [49]. The \u03bd value is notably governed by the fact that above threshold, gain\nclamping fixes the amount of carrier density to Nth, thereby stabilizing the spontaneous emission and thus the random drift of the phase.\n033050-8\nFigure 7 (top panel) shows the measured linewidth\u2014below and above threshold\u2014as a function of the excitation power. On the lower panel, the laser linewidth is shown as a function of the inverted collected power. When lasing starts, the linewidth is inversely proportional to the output power, as predicted by the theory. In contrast to theory, however, the experimental linewidth remains finite, and it approaches a residual value \u03bd0 of about 21 GHz, i.e., 0.09 meV, whose interpretation we give in the next paragraph. Before, we estimate the \u03b1 value from the linewidth dependence on the power by converting the collected power to the total output radiated power Pout; cf. the upper scale of the lower panel of Fig. 7. The conversion is calculated from the corner cube far-field emission pattern as explained in [1]. We thus obtain that the linear increase is reproduced by the ST model for the case of \u03b1 = 0 and the parasitic loss as shown in Fig. 4(c). A low value for \u03b1 means that the change in carrier density does not change the absorption but rather the peak gain. This is not exactly what we find from the gain calculation shown in Fig. 4(b), which results in an \u03b1 value of about 1.7. This value is indeed smaller than what is found for truly direct-band-gap systems, such as III-V compounds, where \u03b1 values are between 2 and 6.\nWhile different experiments validated the SchawlowTownes theory [50\u201352], it was often observed that the linewidth of semiconductor lasers was limited by a powerindependent contribution \u03bd0 [53\u201359]. The origin of the power-independent contribution is still debated. It is often attributed to noise, which adds to the quantum noise, like 1/ f noise [60,61] or occupation fluctuation noise [62]. However, in those cases the linewidth saturates at values in the range of 1\u201310 MHz, orders of magnitude lower than in our case.\nA much stronger broadening mechanism is refractive index fluctuations induced by carrier number noise. This effect, usually neglected thanks to gain clamping, is relevant in injection-controlled tuneable-wavelength lasers, as studied in [63,64]. We apply this carrier noise model to the strained germanium laser, where most of the carriers are not optically\nactive because they populate the L valley and are thus not clamped by gain. From [63,64] adapted to our case, we obtain a \u03bd0 value of 3.6 GHz; cf. Appendix H. The remaining quantitative discrepancy we attributed to multimode operation, which is not included in the ST model. Indeed, we observe a line doublet, cf. Appendix H, separated in frequency by about 26 GHz."

            "text": "The most remarkable observation of the current investigation concerns the existence of a sweet spot of strain at which lasing occurs. This surprising experimental result can be reproduced by the model as demonstrated in Fig. 8(a), which gives the peak gains as functions of total carrier densities for samples L6, L9, and L11. For the calculation of the gain, we used the experimental values for E reported in Table II. Superimposed, we show the total loss due to cavity loss and intervalence band absorption. As before, the IVB absorption is calculated for the energy where the gain peaks. We thus obtain that L5 and L6 do not reach the threshold due to the low amount of delivered gain and the fast rise of IVB absorption for densities larger than 2 to 3\u00d71018 cm\u22123. In contrast, the gain increases fast enough in L9 (and also L7 as well as L7*) to reach the lasing threshold at about 2\u00d71018 cm\u22123. The onset of the IVB absorption explains the observed breakup of lasing at high excitation shown in Fig. 4(a). Finally, L11 does not reach the threshold because strong parasitic loss occurs just before the gain is large enough to overcome the optical losses. As shown in Fig. 4(d), the temperature dependence of the lasing is\u2014at least qualitatively\u2014well explained by the model with phenomenological temperature and broadening parameters. Figure 8(b) shows that the experiment and theory are definitely in line concerning the crossing to a direct-band-gap configuration, but not in the slope, which is shallower in the experiment. We have argued that our method is more accurate for determining the crossover than for determining the slope.\n033050-9\nThe indirect-to-direct crossover determined here also confirms the results from Ref. [1] where samples, similar to those investigated here, strained up to 5.9%, thus with an indirect band gap, were studied. Samples of Ref. [1] showed lasing at low temperature, but only upon pulsed excitation, with a pulse length of 100 ps. This was attributed to (i) indirect band gap, i.e., E > 0, and (ii) the buildup of a transient population inversion, thanks to the blocking of the phonon-mediated to L intervalley scattering. Such a process is particularly effective for electrons with excess energy lower than 28 meV, which corresponds to the energy of the zone-boundary longitudinal acoustic phonon. As a matter of fact, the offset E of the least strained samples showing lasing and the most heavily loaded samples showing no lasing of Ref. [1] are indeed less than 20 meV and about 28 meV, according to the TB calculation for strain of 5.4% and almost 5%, respectively."

            "text": "We developed a versatile laser analysis method for determining the gain and the material and optical losses of group-IV lasers. It is made by deriving the values for the injection carrier densities and the cavity losses from the measurement of the refractive index change and the mode linewidth, respectively. We exemplified the method using Ge microbridges strained up to 6.6%.\nWe determined the strain required to lift germanium across the transition from an indirect to a direct band structure by comparing the calculated gain and loss with experimental observations of laser threshold and/or differential gain. We found a sweet spot for the lasing threshold for uniaxial tensile strain of approximately 6.1%, which also marks the crossover to a direct-band-gap semiconductor. At lower strain, the optical gain is too low to overcome cavity losses, while samples at higher strain suffer from IVB absorption, which depends critically on the transition energy, excitation strength, and temperature. The obtained crossover is well predicted by the tight-binding model [24] and confirms the transient blocking of the valley scattering model of Ref. [1]. The experimental slope by which the offset changes is, however, smaller than predicted. The adoption of an optimized cavity, like a distributed Bragg reflector as in [65], might extend the strain and temperature ranges where lasing is achieved, enabling future studies to address whether the E disagreement is of a fundamental or experimental nature.\nOur method revealed that doping brings about a slight gain enhancement, but only at low excitation, which we attribute to (i) additional gain from doping-induced band tail states, and (ii) a reduced lifetime due to Auger scattering.\nWe discussed the fundamental physics of the laser linewidth in the case when carriers fill dominantly the L levels, which are not optically active and thus are not clamped by gain. We expect that such L-carrier fluctuations may also play a role in other group IV lasers, depending on the actual offset and the temperature of the laser.\nAltogether, we have shown a practical way to achieve lasing in Ge at low temperature and in steady state. We related the lasing to the crossover to a direct band gap. Our analytic method can be applied perfectly to laser cavities realized with other material systems such as GeSn alloys, hexagonally\nordered SiGe [66], and defective Ge [67]. It could thus greatly accelerate the future development of group IV lasers for integration into Si microelectronics."

Spectra are calculated with the tight-binding model for 6% of strain [24]. The tightbinding valence-band structure and inter-valence-band dipole matrix elements are fed into Eq. (D1), and the integration over the wave vector is performed on a tetrahedral mesh around . The transitions between the upper and the lowest valence bands are neglected because they do not contribute at the strain and transition energies relevant herein. Included, in contrast to the interband case, however, is the nonparabolic band structure and the k-dependence of the matrix elements.\nWe note that the IVB absorption strongly increases for decreasing energies and peaks at about 160 meV. Moreover, its high-energy tail increases for carrier density above 2\u00d71018 cm\u22123 and temperature T > 30 K. The latter effect is due to holes filling the states in reciprocal space further apart from the point; cf. Fig. 4(a), main text.\nThe characteristics of the IVB absorption enable us to interpret qualitatively several of the reported effects (main text), such as the L7* and L9 intensity rollovers that shift to lower powers when the temperature increases. Because the lasing transition energy is lower for L9 than for L7*, the rollover\u2014 when the parasitic loss starts dominating\u2014is reached faster for the former. The higher the strain, the lower the band-gap energy and thus the stronger the absorption will be. The gain\nincrease for L10 and L11 is thus not enough to reach lasing threshold under the present conditions.\nWe would also like to note that we neglected the freecarrier absorption of electrons (FCA). This process annihilates a photon by exciting an electron from an occupied state below the quasi-Fermi level to an empty state above [70]. Since such a process requires an impurity or a phonon to comply with momentum conservation, the absence of phonons at low temperature makes FCA negligible compared to IVB absorption [71]. It can thus be ignored."

We interpret the transition from narrowing to broadening as the moment the differential loss overcomes the differential gain. The power at which the linewidth starts broadening decreases when reducing the cavity mode energy. For L9, L10, and L11 samples, the onset of broadening occurs at about 12, 9, and 4.5 mW, respectively.\nAt 30 K, the linewidth broadening becomes stronger.

The fitting function suggests the presence of two modes separated by about 0.08 meV. For the linewidth analyses, we have used the linewidth of the strongest mode.\nTo evaluate the power-independent contribution \u03bd0 due to noise of the unclamped carrier population in L, we recall the excess linewidth expression developed for the wavelengthtuneable lasers [33,34]:\n\u03bd0 = q It \u03c0\n( \u03c9e, mode\u03c4\nq\n)2 , (H1)\nwhere It expresses the injection tuning current, \u03c9e,mode is the lasing angular frequency change per unit of charge q, and \u03c4 is the electron state lifetime. We apply the above equation to the strained germanium laser case by expressing It as Pabs/(h\u03bdext ), where Pabs is\u2014as above\u2014the amount of power absorbed by the microbridge, and h\u03bdext is the excitation energy of 0.59 eV converted in Joule units. At the threshold of 9.6 mW, Pabs = 0.38 mW. We assume that all the carriers populate the L valley. As the change of angular frequency is related to the change of refractive index via the relation \u03c9/\u03c9 = \u2212 n/n, we can express the change per carrier from the Drude\nmodel [69] as already used in Appendix C:\n\u03c9e, mode = \u2212\u03c9 mode n n NV\n= \u03c9mode q 2\u03bc20 h\u0304 2c2\n2(n h\u0304\u03c9 mode) 2m0\u03bcplasma\n1\nV\n= 3.39\u00d7105 rad s , (H2)\nwhere N, \u03bc0, \u03bcplasma, and ng, are as defined in Appendix C.

(H2) into (H1), and by using a carrier lifetime of 5 ns, as discussed in Appendix C, we obtain a linewidth broadening of about \u03bd0 = 3.6 GHz. From the experiment, we obtain \u03bd0 = 21 GHz.\nThe remaining discrepancy is attributed to the fact that our laser does not operate in single mode. For such nonideal single-mode or multimode lasers, the power-independent contribution to the linewidth can reach values above the GHz level due to a nonlinear coupling between modes [72].\nAPPENDIX I: ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS"

However, the error margin of our alignment tool, < 1\u25e6, is too small to have an impact, making this explanation rather unlikely.\n(ii) A similar possibility concerns an inhomogeneous strain distribution as the microbridge structure may bend out of plane. Such bending evokes shear stress, which would have an impact on strain. We indeed observe that the expected relationship between the length of the pads and the bridge and their transversal dimensions does not apply for samples with strains larger than in L6. This is why we determined the strain from the measured band-gap energy, and we did not use its correlation to the geometry, as previously demonstrated [1].\n033050-15\nHowever, shear stress is expected to be minor in the bridge also in the case of bending.\n(iii) A degradation of the samples\u2019 optical properties at the highest strain, for example, due to the generation of a parasitic recombination channel, could result in a gain not evolving as expected. We indeed find that the PL inten-\nsity is reduced for samples L10 and L11 compared to the others.
