    "abstractText": "This study examined online gambling behavior during COVID-19 land-based gambling restrictions and associations with changes in mental health, impacts on household income due to the pandemic, financially focused motivations, and symptoms of gambling problems. A repeated online survey was administered to adult gamblers in Ontario, Canada. Wave 1 was conducted at the beginning of the first COVID-19 lockdown (April 2020) and wave 2 in August 2020. Respondents (N = 940) completed validated self-report questionnaires related to depression and anxiety, financial motivation, financial impacts due to the pandemic, online gambling behaviors, and problem gambling symptomatology. A cluster analysis identified three subgroups: no online gambling (subgroup 1), engagement in a range of gambling games online and change in gambling involvement (i.e., some increased and some decreased gambling; subgroup 2), and predominantly online lottery play with no change in online gambling (subgroup 3). Respondents who reported increased anxiety and depression symptom severity between the two waves and those who experienced greater symptoms of problem gambling and negative impacts on household income due to COVID-19 were most likely to be found in subgroup 2. Greater financial focus was also noted in this group. Results indicate a link between change in online gambling involvement during COVID-19 and increased mental health problems, elevated problem gambling severity, negative impacts on household income, and a greater financially focused self-concept. These results may help generate novel research questions examining short and longterm effects of the pandemic on online behaviors that inform policy and practice.",

As of November 2021, over 255 million cases of COVID19 have been confirmed worldwide with more than 5 million people having died from the virus (World Health Organization, 2021). Lockdown measures enacted to control the virus\n* Alex Price alexp@rgco.org\nExtended author information available on the last page of the article\n1 3\nspread (e.g., physical distancing, business shuttering, school and recreational closures) have contributed to negative secondary social, economic, and mental health consequences (Nicola et\u00a0 al., 2020). For instance, the pandemic has contributed to a reported increase in addictive behavior in the general population, including an increase in online gambling (Gambling Commission, 2020; Mallet et\u00a0 al., 2021; Neill et\u00a0 al., 2020; Sun et\u00a0 al., 2020). What is not certain or fully understood to date are the extended and general impacts of COVID-19 on gambling problems and associated comorbidities (Brodeur et\u00a0 al., 2021; Hodgins & Stevens, 2021).\nAlthough gambling is merely a form of entertainment for most of the nearly 1.6 billion people who gamble, it is estimated that millions of those people experience significant economic, social, and health harm as a result of their gambling (Calado & Griffiths, 2016). The COVID-19 pandemic may have been particularly harmful for gamblers at high risk for gambling problems because they are more likely to be experiencing comorbid mental health problems and financial stress (H\u00e5kansson, 2020; Price, 2020). Additionally, highrisk gamblers tend to be financially motivated (i.e., they gamble to make money; Dechant, 2014; for recent review and meta-analysis, see Tabri, Philander, et\u00a0al., 2021; Tabri, Xuereb, et\u00a0al., 2021) despite the fact that the odds of success are not in the gambler\u2019s favor. The impacts of COVID-19 may be particularly harmful to those who are financially motivated because perceived economic disadvantage\u2014which has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014interacts with the desire to gamble for financial reasons and facilitates problematic gambling behavior (Tabri et\u00a0al., 2017a; Tubadji et\u00a0al., 2021; Hodgins & Stevens, 2021). As such, financial motivations hold the potential to inform our understanding of gambling behaviors and outcomes during COVID-19.\nImportantly, the harms that stem from gambling are not restricted to those who gamble problematically. Lower-risk gamblers also experience gambling-related harms and, perhaps counterintuitively, experience a greater proportion of the harms that stem from gambling (Browne & Rockloff, 2018). Moreover, gambling risks and harms can radiate outwards, affecting family members, friends, employers, and communities (Alexander Blaszczynski, 2009; Browne et\u00a0al., 2016; Langham et\u00a0al., 2016). There is some indication that gamblingrelated harms experienced by all these parties have been exacerbated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic due, in part, to the isolation, confinement, fear of disease, and the availability of online gambling (Hakansson et\u00a0al., 2020).\nIn the current research, we used a repeated-measures design (two waves separated by three months) to better understand gambling and its correlates during COVID-19 precipitated closure of land-based casinos and community gambling facilities, which occurred six weeks prior to the first wave of data collection. Specifically, we assessed online gambling behaviors, problem gambling severity, mental health problems, and financial concerns and motivations among gamblers during COVID-19 corresponding with the closure of most land-based gambling venues in the province of Ontario, Canada. Collected data represented two time points over the course of three months. During the first wave of survey research, Ontario had just entered its first province-wide lockdown, which severely restricted movement and access to public and private venues, including land-based gambling establishments (e.g., casinos and community gaming facilities). The second wave of research occurred during a period of restriction easing, although most land-based gambling venues, such as casinos, remained closed.\nIn this study, our stated hypotheses tested self-reported change in online gambling. Change refers not only to increased or decreased frequency of play, but also games played, and change in environment (e.g., online). Specifically, we predicted that participants who reported an increase (relative to decrease) in mental health problems during the first few\n1 3\nmonths of the COVID-19 lockdown would report greater change in online gambling during the COVID-19 land-based gambling restrictions at wave 2. In addition, we predicted that people who reported their household income as being negatively affected by COVID19 would report greater change in online gambling during the pandemic gambling restrictions compared to people who reported negligible impacts on household income. We also hypothesized that people who gambled and who are more (relative to less) financially focused\u2014the belief that the possession of money is a central domain to self-definition and thus self-worth\u2014would report greater changes in online gambling involvement during COVID-19 gambling restrictions. Lastly, we tested the supposition that those who have more (relative to less) symptoms of gambling problems would report greater change in online gambling during the COVID-19 gambling restrictions."

Utilizing their AskingCanadians panel population of over one million Canadians, Delvinia sent out recruitment notifications to registered members who had responded to the first wave survey, conducted at the end of April, 2020. Respondents recruited were directed to the research team\u2019s Qualtrics survey, where data was collected and verified for quality assurance. Return respondents were again screened before filling out the survey to ensure they were at least 18\u00a0years old, residents of Ontario, and had gambled at least once in the past 12\u00a0months, either on land or online. Survey respondents also received an informed consent statement prior to the survey and a debriefing statement at the end. This research received ethics approval from Carleton University Research Ethics Board-B (project ID#113017). Following questionnaire\n1 3\ncompletion, Delvinia compensated participants through a variety of consumer points programs (e.g., Hudson Bay Company, Aeroplan, VIA Preference, Petro Points, etc.).1\nOf the 1,018 participants who completed both waves, 73 were excluded due to missing responses on key measures examined in the current research, three were excluded because they indicated they \u201cdid not know\u201d when responding to a question about whether their income was affected by COVID-19, and two participants were excluded because they provided conflicting responses on the measure of online gambling (e.g., spent more money on gambling and spent less money on gambling). Thus, 940 participants were included in the analyses."

Depression was assessed through the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), derived from the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-ED) diagnostic tool for mental disorders (Homans, 2012; Kroenke et\u00a0 al., 2001). The PHQ-9 includes nine items from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) depression criteria, which are scored out of a total possible 27 points. Moreover, the PHQ-9 shares a prompting question with the tool assessing anxiety symptoms, the General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire: \u201cOver the last 2\u00a0weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems?\u201d Interpretation of depression scores include minimal (0\u20134), mild (5\u20139), moderate (10\u201314), moderately severe (15\u201319), and severe (20\u201327). The GAD-7 presents seven DSM-IV items for generalized anxiety disorder (Spitzer et\u00a0al., 2006). Scoring was out of a total possible 21 points and features four interpretive categories, including minimal (0\u20134), mild (5\u20139), moderate (10\u201314), and severe (15\u201321). Change in mental health problems was calculated by averaging depression and anxiety scores at waves 1 (\u03b1depression = 0.89 and \u03b1anxiety = 0.92) and 2 (\u03b1depression = 0.92 and \u03b1anxiety = 0.93), and subtracting the average score of wave 2 from wave 1.

In the analyses, the reference group was subgroup 3 (played online games, largely the lottery, but did not report a change in online gambling activities) and we examined the likelihood of participants being classified in subgroups 1 (did not play online games) and 2 (played online games during COVID-19 and indicated changes in online play).\nUnstandardized regression coefficients and odds ratios for univariate associations are reported in Table\u00a03 and reported for multivariate associations in Table\u00a04. In line with our hypotheses, an increase in mental health problems from wave 1 to wave 2, greater financially focused self-concept, reporting that income was negatively affected by COVID-19, and greater problem gambling severity were each associated with change in online gambling and greater probability of subgroup 2 membership (online multi-game players that changed their online activities) relative to subgroup 3 (online lottery players). The magnitude of the relations was small. In the multivariate analyses, the strength of the relation between each predictor and group membership was slightly attenuated but remained statistically significant.\nNone of the predictors differentiated between participants in subgroup 1 (who do not play online games and did not change their behavior during the COVID-19 data collection period) and participants in subgroup 3 (people who largely played the lottery online and reported no change in their online play).\nVariable 1 2 3 4\n1 3\nTa bl\ne 3\nR es\nul ts\nfr om\nu ni\nva ria\nte m\nul tin\nom ia\nl r eg\nre ss\nio n\nan al\nys es\ne xa\nm in\nin g\npr ed\nic to\nrs o\nf m em\nbe rs\nhi p\nin su\nbg ro\nup s 1\na nd\n2 re\nla tiv\ne to\nsu bg\nro up\n3\nO R\nod ds\nra tio\n.

            "text": "During the entry and exit of the first lockdown in Ontario, Canada, this study found that variation in online gambling involvement during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased mental health problems over time, negative household income impacts due to COVID-19, stronger financially focused self-concept, and elevated gambling problems. Three subgroups of online gamblers were identified and characterized as generally abstaining from online gambling during COVID-19 (subgroup 1); active online gamblers demonstrating greater changes of time, money, and game involvement (subgroup 2); and those who gambled online during COVID-19, but reported no change in their level of involvement and mostly played lottery (subgroup 3). None of the predictors was able to differentiate between subgroups 1 and 3.\nRecent studies examining the COVID-19 influences on online gamblers have reported mixed outcomes\u2014some studies report increased gambling involvement, whereas others describe a decrease (Fluharty et\u00a0 al., 2020; Frisone et\u00a0 al., 2020; H\u00e5kansson, 2020; Price, 2020; Sharman et\u00a0al., 2021). This study\u2019s findings, using a cluster analysis approach, provide some context for previous investigation\u2019s varied results. Specifically, we found a distinct at-risk cohort who report variable gambling involvement (subgroup 2), which may relate to their increased mental health problems over time, in addition to financial stress and focused motivation. Indeed, while some increase gambling to cope with negative lived experiences (e.g., poor mental health and financial troubles; Dechant, 2014; Schellenberg & Mcgrath, 2016), others retreat from activities following long-term negative conditions like depression (Lewinsohn & Libet, 1972). The study herein also complements one Australian study that did not find associations between problem gambling, gambling involvement, or psychological distress (Gainsbury et\u00a0al., 2020)\u2014that study reported moderate risk gamblers had a greater likelihood of increased gambling frequency compared to non-problem and low risk gamblers. The lack of associations in Gainsbury and colleagues\u2019 (2020) study may be due to the current study\u2019s use of a repeated-measurement design in which participants reported current states rather than relying on recall over multiple months. Our analytic approach also included financial impact dimensions and motivations, previously not widely adopted.\nThe current study is unique among the existing (published) research on gambling during the COVID-19 pandemic because it is one of the first to examine mental health changes as they relate to online gambling involvement at more than one point in time, while also considering financial impacts and motivation. Accordingly, this study provides insights into subgroups most vulnerable to mental health changes over time and variations in online gambling involvement. Those insights may be helpful when designing prevention approaches during times of reduced access to land-based gambling venues, such as during subsequent COVID-19 lockdowns. For example, our findings suggest that educational messaging during the pandemic (and similar events) may have the greatest utility in terms of reducing excessive gambling behavior if it focuses on some people\u2019s tendency to increase their gambling, especially if they are gambling to escape mental health problems (or the stress associated with the pandemic), or gambling as a means to make money (or make up for money lost as a result of the pandemic). Our findings also show that some people decreased their gambling during the pandemic. Understanding this group better\u00a0may help with prevention efforts during the pandemic, but also be helpful post-pandemic. Indeed, there is currently a dearth of research on factors that lead to decreased gambling. Furthermore, results suggest that online gambling operators should (re)consider the information\n1 3\nand resources provided to players during constricted gambling availability (Stark & Robinson, 2021). For example, gambling operators should consider disseminating tailored information supporting players demonstrating play variation (determined via player account data).\nThis study addresses a need for repeated measurement research examining gambling impacts on public health phenomena (Price et\u00a0al., 2021). Future research could try to replicate findings in international jurisdictions with different lockdown conditions and over longer time periods. Increased focus on identifying subgroups and addictive behaviors, integrating financial concerns and financially-focused self-concept, can improve our understanding of gambling problems and COVID-19 impacts."

            "text": "The current study only analyzed two time points separated by three months; though this may limit the breadth of our analyses, the data collected reflects a response to rapidly evolving changes in the pandemic. Recall bias may have affected results, and external validity may be limited as results are drawn from a single provincial jurisdiction. However, Ontario has a substantial foreign-born population (~ 30%; Ontario Ministry of Finance, 2017), which may mitigate social/cultural influences of more homogenous gambling populations. Some question items drafted for this survey may also have limited utility in assessing positive impacts associated with the pandemic, such as the Likert-scale question asking whether \u201cmy household income has been negatively affected by COVID19\u201d (strongly disagree-strongly agree). Finally, the wording used to describe our analytic strategy varied slightly from that outlined in our pre-registration. For instance, instead of framing a hypothesis as a test of factors that may lead to \u201cgreater gambling involvement,\u201d we changed the wording to be one that tests factors that may lead to \u201cvariance in online gambling.\u201d We made this change because (after pre-registration) we realized wording the hypothesis as a test of \u201cgreater gambling involvement\u201d neglects the fact that some people\u2019s gambling may decrease."

            "text": "This study identified an online gambling cohort (subgroup 2) who varied the time, money, and games played during the COVID-19 pandemic. This subgroup\u2019s behavioral profile was associated with increased mental health problems over time, negative COVID-19 impacts on household income, stronger financially focused self-concepts, and elevated gambling problems. There is a critical need for further research on the intersection of online gambling, mental health, and financial security and motivation in other international settings. Such studies will help build consensus understanding on the pandemic effects\u2014and more broadly stress and gambling access\u2014related to comorbid health risks and socioeconomic determinants of health. To this end, a third wave of data has been collected and will be featured in future analyses of gambling and health trends.\nAcknowledgements The authors acknowledge the technical support of Silas Xuereb and Mackenzie Dowson related to survey administration.\nFunding This study was funded through a COVID-19 Rapid Response Research Grant (#RSGRANT185594) awarded by Carleton University.\n1 3\nAll authors report no financial relationships with commercial interests or other conflicts of interest\u00a0tied to this research.\nAP has conducted independent research, evaluation, and reviews funded by the Carleton University (Canada), the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (Canada), the International Center for Responsible Gaming (USA), the Gambling Research Exchange Ontario (Canada), the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation (Australia), the Canadian Consortium for Gambling Research (Canada), the Canadian Gaming Association (Canada), the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation, and other gambling operators in Canada, the UK, Italy, Australia, and Japan.
