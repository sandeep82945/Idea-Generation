            "text": "\u201cCulture eats strategy for breakfast\u201d (Strategies for Influence, 2021). This phrase has been attributed to a famous management consultant named Peter Drucker and is popular at various leadership, change management, or other business conferences and forums. It conveys a simple message. The best organizational strategies can be rendered ineffective by the organization\u2019s culture. Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) practitioners know just how important organizational culture is to the success of ERM programs. This is why behavioral metrics should be utilized to assess the organizational risk culture.\nWHAT IS \u201cRISK CULTURE?\u201d\nAccording to the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), \u201crisk culture pertains to ethical values, desired behaviors, and understanding of risk in the entity\u201d (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, 2017). Howmuch risk are people in an organization allowed to take in the performance of their duties? Is the organization, or subgroups within, risk seeking or risk adverse? When, how, and to whom should risks be communicated? Are people punished for communicating risks? Are people who take risks smartly, but still end up failing, rewarded or punished? The answers to these questions constitute the fabric of an organization\u2019s risk culture. The responses and behavior of senior leaders, middle management, and frontline personnel concerning the questions above are far more indicative of the risk culture than any number of policies and memorandums. ERM program managers should assess their organization\u2019s risk culture periodically because risk culture influences risk management effectiveness. Risk culture affects decisions such as setting strategic objectives, risk appetites (how\nmuch risk to take to achieve objectives), and willingness to conform to compliance requirements (Hillson, 2013). Assessing risk culture will provide insights into the mindset of decision makers BEFORE these important decisions are made."

            "text": "The Federal government annually administers the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) to gauge the federal workforce climate (Office of Personnel Management, 2021). The FEVS survey focuses on employee engagement, organizational leadership, and work experiences. Months after the survey concludes, agency leadership is provided a summary of how their employees (anonymously) answered each question plus a comparison to the responses provided by employees of similar agencies. Based on these responses and comparative data, agency leaders may change how they manage human capital programs such as leave (paid time off), promotions, workplace flexibilities, and training opportunities. While the FEVS provides useful behavioral metrics for an organization\u2019s culture, it also sheds light into the risk culture of the organization as well. Not every FEVS question pertains to risk culture, but there are some that uncover the risk mindset of employees. The FEVS questions below are indicators of the organizational risk culture. Participants answer how strongly they agree or disagree with these statements.\n- I can disclose a suspected violation of any law, rule, or regulation without fear of reprisal. - Employees are protected from health and safety hazards on the job. - My agency is successful at accomplishing its mission. - Managers communicate the goals of the organization.\nOver the past 4 years, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Risk Management Program has been tracking the percentages of respondents who answer positively (Strongly Agree/Agree), neutral, and negatively (Strongly Disagree/Disagree) to these statements. The 2017\u20132020 FEVS results have established a baseline for each of these measures so that the NIH Risk Management Program can monitor these FEVS responses for undesirable trends or significant deviations from those baselines. Figure 1 below shows the percentage of responses that were positive, neutral, and negative for the FEVS risk culture questions identified above between calendar years 2017\u20132020. In 2020, nearly 73% of NIH FEVS participants responded positively to the question regarding the disclosure of a suspected violation of law without reprisal. Over the past couple of years, the positive response rate to this question has hovered around the 72\u201373% mark. The goal of the NIH Risk Management Program is to get as close to 100% as possible because risks cannot be identified if people feel like they cannot disclose violations without reprisal. If the percentage of participants that answer positively to this question begins to drop (or the percentage of respondents that answer negatively begin to rise)\nthen this indicates that the NIH risk culture may be prohibiting risk identification.\nIf there were to be undesired changes in the above measures, the NIH Risk Management Program may tailor risk identification methods. For example, the NIH Risk Management staff could collect risk data by conducting anonymous surveys or nonattributable interviews. Additionally, the NIH Risk Management Program could host training sessions or webinars for supervisors and managers about the importance of allowing employees to identify risks without fear of reprisals. Another option could be to draft an e-mail or memorandum from the NIHDirector reminding supervisors andmanagers that frontline staff are essential to proactively identifying and managing risks. Without measuring andmonitoring FEVS questions like the ones above, the NIH Risk Management Program would not know that such activities were needed. These FEVS measures inform how the NIH Risk Management Program should respond to changes in NIH employee behavior so that NIH\u2019s Risk Management Program objectives can be achieved."

            "heading": "UTILIZING BEHAVIOR-BASED TRAINING METRICS TO ASSESS RISK CULTURE",
            "text": "In addition to the FEVS questions listed above, NIH assesses risk culture using behavioral metrics derived from NIH\u2019s risk management training activities. The goal of risk management training is to provide NIH employees with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to apply risk management principles to their jobs. How is training, especially risk management training, measured to ensure that successful training outcomes such as certain desired risk management behaviors are increasing? The Kirkpatrick Model provides a framework for measuring training programs (Kirkpatrick, 1994). The NIH Risk Management Program uses the Kirkpatrick Model because it focuses on employee behaviors. The Kirkpatrick Model aligns employee behaviors acquired or reinforced through training activities to organizational goals. The Kirkpatrick Model identifies four levels of training evaluations (Kirkpatrick, 1994).\n- Level 1 (Reaction): Evaluate how employees felt about the training. - Level 2 (Learning): Evaluate to what degree did the employees retain or absorb training. - Level 3 (Behavior): Evaluate to what degree are the employees applying the training. - Level 4 (Results): Evaluate influence on organizational objectives.\nThese four levels provide the framework for collecting and utilizing behavioral metrics to inform NIH\u2019s Risk Management Program operations. These behavioral metrics are gleaned from post-training surveys, stakeholder surveys, and analysis of jobrelated products.\nThe first level of the Kirkpatrick Model deals with the employees\u2019 emotional response to the training. It\u2019s not surprising that a person\u2019s emotions and behaviors are connected, so gathering this type of response is crucial. The NIH Risk\nFrontiers in Research Metrics and Analytics | www.frontiersin.org 2 May 2022 | Volume 7 | Article 891324\nManagement post-training survey asks employees behavioral questions like, \u201cWould you recommend this training to a colleague?\u201d This type of question is an important behavioral indicator because NIH\u2019s Risk Management Training is not mandatory. When NIH markets risk management training, it relies on employees spreading their positive experiences with their colleagues.\nLevel 2 behavioral metrics focuses on whether the employees absorbed the training material. Typically, this is done through quizzes, progress checks, and test; however, these types of measuring instruments do not really get to the behavior of employees. Instead of tests, employees are asked after a training session to identify what knowledge or skills from the training session they intend to apply to their job. This is critically important in risk management because knowing risk management is simply not enough to identify and manage organizational risks. Employees must be able to apply risk management principles and concepts to their daily work. Risk management application varies from someone in the human capital, finance, grants management, or scientific research arenas. If employees cannot apply the riskmanagement training, then the NIH Risk Management Program is wasting time and resources.\nLevel 3 is directly tied to employee behavior. In most organizational settings, on-the-job performance is a behavioral indicator of training effectiveness. For the NIHRiskManagement\nProgram, analysis of annual risk inventories1 provides insights into the behaviors of NIH\u2019s risk management practitioners. The primary focus of the NIH risk management training curriculum is to get risk management practitioners to complete annual risk inventories according to prescribed data quality standards. For NIH, risk inventories are a list of each institute or center\u2019s risks and risk responses. The prescribed data quality standards for these risk inventories ensures that the NIH Risk Management Program receives useful risk data. For example, the NIH Risk Management Program requires risks to be written in an \u201cIf/Then\u201d format (If X happens, then Y will occur.) so that the risk is clearly and concisely communicated. Additionally, reduce risk responses must identify future mitigation activities and have a target date for those actions. Every year, the NIH Risk Management Program analyzes the risk inventories from the 27 institutes and centers to determine how well they are adhering to the data quality standards. This analysis informs future risk management training activities.\nFinally, level 4 evaluates how risk management training influences risk management at NIH. The FEVS risk culture behavioral questions are also helpful here\u2013especially the question\n1A \u201cRisk Inventory\u201d is a term the NIH Risk Management Program uses to describe the database of identified risks. \u201cRisk Inventory\u201d is similar to the term \u201cRisk Register\u201d that may be commonly used in other ERM Programs.\nFrontiers in Research Metrics and Analytics | www.frontiersin.org 3 May 2022 | Volume 7 | Article 891324\nabout managers communicating the goals of the organization. It\u2019s impossible to identify relevant risks if risk practitioners do not know the goals (and the associated objectives) of the organization. Part of the NIH Risk Management Program training describes how to integrate strategic planning and risk management activities. This FEVS question helps inform the efficacy of that training. Additionally, the NIH Risk Management Program conducts stakeholder surveys to determine if decisionmakers regularly incorporate risk management information into management decisions such as budget and program performance. If decision-makers tell the NIH Risk Management Program that risk information is not incorporated into the process, then changes need to be made on what and/or how risk data is being communicated to decision makers.\nMetrics collected utilizing the four levels of the Kirkpatrick Model provide behavioral insights into NIH\u2019s risk culture. For example, analysis of past risk inventories [Level 3 (Behavior)] showed a downward trend of risk statements that were in an \u201cIf/Then\u201d format and written clearly and concisely. Furthermore, the analysis of risk inventories revealed that the majority of NIH\u2019s risk responses were identifying past mitigation actions instead of identifying avenues for future actions. This demonstrates a lack of risk understanding, which as noted earlier is essential to risk culture. According to a NIH internal 2020 risk management stakeholder survey [Level 4 (Results)], roughly 27% of participants do not believe that (or do not know if) risk management information is being used in organizational decision making. This demonstrates that some organizations within NIH are not applying the risk management principles being taught. This indicates an ineffective risk culture in some areas within NIH.\nThese training metrics served as the catalyst for several changes in the NIH RiskManagement Program to improve NIH\u2019s risk culture. First, the risk management training shifted focus from online learning modules to classroom and webinar casebased sessions. Two of the risk management training courses require employees to assume the role of a risk management practitioner at a fictitious organization where they are presented with real-world scenarios. This provided a risk-free environment to apply risk management principles to similar job situations.\nSecond, the Risk Management Program constructed a course and training video on how to write proper \u201cIF/Then\u201d risk statements. The training breaks down the requirements of the \u201cIF/Then\u201d risk statement, offers examples, and provides an opportunity to practice writing risk statements with real-world risk data. Finally, the NIH Risk Management Program restructured its \u201cFunctional Owner Report\u201d to deliver more useful risk data. Functional Owner Reports are annual risk data reports that the NIH Risk Management Program offers to business and program area leaders in NIH. These newly revamped reports contain additional risk trend data that could assist these key NIH decision makers. Hopefully, these changes will improve NIH\u2019s risk culture indicators in the coming years."

The NIH Risk Management Program reviews periodic data from the FEVS, risk management training activities, and other stakeholder surveys to evaluate NIH\u2019s risk culture. These metrics provide the behavioral insights to the risk mindset of NIH personnel. Based on the data trends from those metrics, the NIH Risk Management Program decides if changes in ERM policy, training, or communications are warranted. Once the applicable changes are implemented, the next iteration of these metrics are analyzed to determine if the implemented changes had the desired effect. In this manner, the NIH Risk Management Program decisions are more data-driven and aligned with NIH\u2019s risk culture."

Behavioral metrics serve as indicators for ERM program managers to \u201cpulse check\u201d the risk mindset of the people in their organizations. Organizations probably have these behavior metrics readily available in climate assessment, training, and stakeholder surveys. It is just a matter of pulling it all together. Risk culture assessments can lead to more informed ERM program decisions. Do not let a good organizational ERM strategy get gobbled up for breakfast by a ravenous risk culture."
