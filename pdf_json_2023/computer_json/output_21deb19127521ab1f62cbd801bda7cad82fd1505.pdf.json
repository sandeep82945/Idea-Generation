    "abstractText": "Space-Time Block-Encoded 16-APSK in Aeronautical Mobile Telemetry Autumn Twitchell Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, BYU Master of Science The two-antenna problem in aeronautical mobile telemetry is created by the reception of two copies of the same RF waveform with different phases and time delays. Alamouti and Alamouti-like space time block codes can solve the two-antenna problem, but the decoder/detector needs to account for the different time delays between the signals received from the two transmit antennas. In this thesis, a comparison is made between the performance of Alamouti space-time block codes and time-reversed space-time block codes with 16-APSK to solve the two-antenna problem. The maximum likelihood decoder/detector for Alamouti-encoded 16-APSK is a sequence detector operating on a trellis with a large number of states. A practical state-reduction technique is presented. The results produce a trellis with 256 states and a small loss in bit error rate performance as long as the delay difference is not too big. The decoder/detector for the time-reversed space time block requires only waveform manipulations and channel matched filtering in the case where the two channels are simple delays. For the more general case of multipath propagation between the two transmit antennas and the receiver, the decoder/detector requires an equalizer; simulation results using a channel pair measured at a test range show that the decoder/detector is capable of achieving near AWGN performance with a modest equalizer.",

            "text": "Aeronautical mobile telemetry (AMT) is an air-to-ground radio link carrying mea-\nsurements from an airborne test article to a ground station. The measurements (telemetry) contain all the information required for flight test engineers to ensure safety of flight and to determine if the test article meets performance requirements. To increase the spatial coverage on fixed- and rotary-winged test articles, two antennas are often used to account for blockage by the fuselage. The most common configuration is to place one antenna on the top of the fuselage and the other on the bottom as shown in Figure 1.1.\nThe earliest implementations of this configuration transmitted the same RF telemetry\nsignal from both antennas using a power splitter connected to the telemetry transmitter output. This implementation created a simple antenna array defined by the two antennas. An example of the radiation gain pattern created by two antennas is shown in Figure 1.2. The result was a sequence of link outages when the test article executed a turn: the drop outs occurred when the propagation path from the test article to the ground station was through one of the nulls. When bit rates increased beyond 5 Mbits/s, the link was difficult to maintain even when the propagation path was through one of the high-gain lobes. In this case, the link outages are the result of self-interference resulting from the difference in propagation delays between the two antennas and the ground station. Collectively, the problems associated with transmitting the same signal from two antennas separated by several wavelengths is called the two-antenna problem [1]\u2013[6].\nThe use of space-time coding to solve the two-antenna problem was pioneered in [1]\nfor QPSK. The idea was applied to the continuous phase modulations (CPMs) defined in the AMT standards IRIG-106 [7] in [2], [3], [5], [6].\n1\nThere has been recent interest in adopting non-binary linear modulations in AMT to\nimprove spectral efficiency. To be viable, the modulation must have a relatively low peak-toaverage power ratio so that the required output backoff in the RF power amplifier does not significantly reduce operating range of the radio link. The PAPR/backoff tradeoff is common in satellite communications. The direct video broadcast, satellite second generation (DVBS2) standard [8] addresses the PAPR issue by defining constellations whose points lie on one circle (QPSK and 8-PSK), two circles (16-APSK), and three circles (32-APSK). Because\n2\n16-APSK and 32-APSK constellations achieve a reasonable tradeoff between peak-to-average power ratio and throughput, 16-APSK has been considered for use in AMT [9]. The authors of [10] explored the use of 16- and 32-APSK with turbo codes in the AMT. The results showed that 16-APSK with rate-4/5 turbo codes is able to achieve spectral efficiency approximately 3 times that of the uncoded CPM in IRIG 106 called SOQPSK-TG. SOQPSK-TG stands for shaped offset QPSK, version \u201cTG\u201d. Despite its name, SOQPSK-TG is a CPM with a modulation index of 1/2, a constrained ternary alphabet, and a frequency pulse spanning 8 bit times.\nA natural question in the evolution of AMT modulations is to investigate the per-\nformance of 16-APSK in solving the two-antenna problem. Alamouti\u2019s space-time block code (A-STBC) [11] and Lindskog\u2019s time-reversed space-time block code (TR-STBC) [12] are investigated in this thesis. The justification for these two (and only these two) is based on the following observations. The motivation for A-STBC is the fact that it was proven in [1] that Alamouti\u2019s space-time block code solves the two-antenna problem using QPSK. The impact of a differential delay was not addressed in [1] but is examined in the authors\u2019 conference article for 16-APSK [4] and summarized in Chapter 2. The maximum likelihood decoder/detector for A-STBC in the presence of a differential delay is a sequence detector whose complexity can be prohibitive for large constellations with bandlimited pulse shaping. The motivation for TR-STBC is its Alamouti-like structure for symbol sequences and the ability to incorporate parallel equalizers after a waveform orthogonalization step. The different propagation delays from the two transmit antennas are treated as channels whose outputs need to be equalized. The use of simple linear equalizers avoids the complex trellis required by the A-STBC decoder/detector. Most of the work on STBCs following [11], [12] explore orthogonal space-time codes or quasi-orthogonal space time codes for a larger number of transmit and receive antennas. In AMT, the problem is confined to two transmit antennas and one receive antenna; the larger codes are not needed.\nThe results of this work are the following.\n1. The maximum likelihood detector for A-STBC in the presence of a differential delay is\na sequence detector whose Viterbi algorithm implementation requires a trellis with too many states to be of any practical interest. A state-reduction technique, based on a\n3\nsimple approximation of the pulse shape autocorrelation function, is shown to produce an enormous reduction in the trellis size at the cost of a fraction of a dB loss in bit error rate performance. The performance loss increases with increasing differential delay; this favorable trade-off works as long as the differential delay is not too large.\n2. The TR-STBC is reformulated in the continous-time waveform domain. This is per-\nformed to derive a filter-based version of the TR-STBC decoder/detector to replace the linear operator formulation in [12]. The filter-based version is preferable for long data sequences. The filter-based version comprises three steps: waveform partition, waveform decoding, equalization and detection. For the case where the propagation paths from the two transmit antennas are simple delays, we show that the first two steps are all that is required; equalization is not required. Computer simulations show that the bit error rate performance of the TR-STBC decoder/detector coincides with the 16-APSK bit error rate performance in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), and achieves this performance for all differential delays of practical interest. TR-STBC is robust with differential delay in a way that A-STBC is not.\n3. In addition to the computational complexity advantage and bit error rate performance\nadvantages, TR-STBC is capable of operating in a multipath propagation environment with the same complexity. A-STBC is theoretically able to operate in a multipath environment, but the required complexity renders the approach infeasible. The effectiveness of TR-STBC on a pair of real channels measured at Edwards AFB, USA is presented. The results show that a simple linear equalizer is capable of achieving a bit error rate performance equivalent to that of 16-APSK in the AWGN environment.\nThe contributions of this work are listed below.\n\u2022 The A-STBC and TR-STBC methods have been used on continuous phase modulations\nsuch as SO-QPSK and ARTM CPM. The significance with this thesis is that these methods are used for 16-APSK, which is a linear phase modulation.\n4\n<latexit sha1_base64=\"sB4c6qP/QKlionxyRDbF71qiSNQ=\">AAABbnicSyrIySwuMTC4ycjEzMLKxs7BycXNw8vHLyAoFFacX1qUnBqanJ+TXxSRlFicmpOZlxpaklmSkxpRUJSamJuUkxqelO0Mkg8vSy0qzszPCympLEiNzU1Mz8tMy0xOLAEJeWpka8YLKBvoGYCBAibDEMpQdmCpeui+TqQ6IF4gNCYlP7k0NzWvJDknsbg42tCooCS2OrGoJDM5J7WWK6a0OLUgMTk7MT21OjG3uLgyN6lWQTU3sSSjGF0OJAiTA7rDEN1WTEaYkZ6hmZ5JINBBGgwQwMEgzaDEoMFgyGDO4MDgwRDAEMqQzJDB0McwnWEGwwdGMUZZRnmIUiZGqB5hBhTAqAEAi25fNg==</latexit>\n\u2022 Another key component to this work is that the simulations are performed with a\ndifferential delay which is unique to AMT. This differential delay has not been explored for linear phase modulations using these encoding methods.\n\u2022 The two methods, A-STBC and TR-STBC, are simulated and analyzed for 16-APSK.\nIt is concluded that the TR-STBC method triumphs over the A-STBC method when it comes to the two-antenna problem in AMT for 16-APSK in the presence of a differential delay.\nThis thesis is organized as follows. The problem formulation is presented in Sec-\ntion 1.2. The application of the Alamouti space-time block code is described in Chapter 2 and the time-reversed space-time block code is developed in Chapter 3. Conclusions are discussed in Chapter 4."

The space-time encoding techniques investigated here are applied to the user symbols. The result is two parallel symbol streams J0(k) and J1(k) both of which also comprise 16-APSK symbols. Pulse shaping is applied to create the complex-valued low-pass equivalent waveforms. The pulse shape p(t) is a square-root Nyquist pulse shape [13] with support on T1 \u2264 t \u2264 T2.\n5\nThe propagation channels are represented by LTI systems with impulse responses\nc0(t) and c1(t). Our primary interest is with the channels\nc0(t) = g0\u03b4(t\u2212 \u03c40) c1(t) = g1\u03b4(t\u2212 \u03c41) (1.1)\nwhere g0 and g1 are complex-valued propagation gains, and \u03c40 and \u03c41 are the delays, respectively, of the channels between s0(t) and s1(t) and the receiver. This case is noted in Figure 1.3. The reason for the more generalized form used in the figure is explained in Chapter 3.\nThe received signal is given by\nr(t) = s0(t) \u22c6 c0(t) + s1(t) \u22c6 c1(t) + z(t) (1.2)\nwhere \u22c6 is the continuous-time convolution operator and z(t) is the thermal noise modeled by a circularly symmetric complex-valued wide-sense stationary normal random process with zero mean and covariance\nE{z(t+ \u03c4)z\u2217(t)} = 2N0\u03b4(\u03c4). (1.3)\nThe relationship between J0(n) and J1(n) and the user symbols I(n) is based on\neither the Alamouti space-time block code (A-STBC) or the time-reversed space-time block\n6\ncode (TR-STBC). The form of the optimum detector depends on the space-time code used. The two space-time block codes are explored in the following two chapters.\n7\nCHAPTER 2. A-STBC FOR 16-APSK\nRecall the problem illustrated in Figure 1.1. The application of A-STBC to this\nproblem was explored in our conference article [4]. Alamouti encoding is performed on a block-by-block basis where each block comprises two symbols I(2n), I(2n+1) and produces a pair of encoded symbols\nJ0(2n) = I(2n) J0(2n+ 1) = \u2212I\u2217(2n+ 1) (2.1) J1(2n) = I(2n+ 1) J1(2n+ 1) = I \u2217(2n) (2.2)\nfor 0 \u2264 n \u2264 N \u2212 1 (i.e. a total of 2N symbols). The complex-valued baseband equivalent signals [14] transmitted from the airborne test article are\ns0(t) = 2N\u22121\u2211 n=0 J0(n)p(t\u2212 nTs)\ns1(t) = 2N\u22121\u2211 n=0 J1(n)p(t\u2212 nTs) (2.3)\nwhere p(t) is the pulse shape and Ts is the symbol time.\nThe received signal is given by\nr(t) = g0s0(t\u2212 \u03c40) + g1s1(t\u2212 \u03c41) + z(t). (2.4)\nThe goal is to produce decisions for the user symbol sequence I from the observation r(t).\n8"

(2.16) A search must be performed to find the symbol sequence I\u0302 that maximizes (2.16). To use the Viterbi algorithm to perform this search, (2.16) must be written in a recursive form. The double summation on the right-hand side of (2.16) is what makes a recursive form difficult. The double summations in (2.16) are manipulated into a recursive form as follows.\nThe double summation in (2.16) has three summands denoted S1, S2, and S3. Start-\ning with the double summation applied to S1, the inner summation is partitioned into three summations, each corresponding to the indexes \u2113 for which the subscripts of the autocorrelation function are positive, zero, and negative:\nN\u22121\u2211 k=0 N\u22121\u2211 \u2113=0 [I(2k)I\u2217(2\u2113+ 1)\u2212 I\u2217(2k + 1)I(2\u2113)]x2k\u22122\u2113(\u2206\u03c4/Ts) =\nN\u22121\u2211 k=1 k\u22121\u2211 \u2113=0 [I(2k)I\u2217(2\u2113+ 1)\u2212 I\u2217(2k + 1)I(2\u2113)]x2k\u22122\u2113(\u2206\u03c4/Ts)\n+ N\u22121\u2211 k=0 [I(2k)I\u2217(2k + 1)\u2212 I\u2217(2k + 1)I(2k)]x0(\u2206\u03c4/Ts)\n+ N\u22122\u2211 k=0 N\u22121\u2211 \u2113=k+1 [I(2k)I\u2217(2\u2113+ 1)\u2212 I\u2217(2k + 1)I(2\u2113)]x2k\u22122\u2113(\u2206\u03c4/Ts).

Exchanging the order of the summations on the third term and reassigning the summation indexes produces\nN\u22121\u2211 k=0 N\u22121\u2211 \u2113=k+1 [I(2k)I\u2217(2\u2113+ 1)\u2212 I\u2217(2k + 1)I(2\u2113)]x2k\u22122\u2113(\u2206\u03c4/Ts) =\nN\u22121\u2211 k=1 k\u22121\u2211 \u2113=0 [I(2\u2113)I\u2217(2k + 1)\u2212 I\u2217(2\u2113+ 1)I(2k)]x2l\u22122k(\u2206\u03c4/Ts).

I\u0302(n)\nA block diagram of the detector is illustrated in Figure 2.1. The received signal is passed through a filter matched to the pulse shape and sampled at the four instants required to compute the branch metric (2.29). These four samples, along with the propagation constants g0, g1, and \u2206\u03c4/Ts or their estimates are used to compute one step in the Viterbi algorithm. After 2N matched filter samples have been produced and processed, a traceback may be performed to identify the ML sequence estimate I\u0302.\nThe number of states required for ML detection is an important consideration. For\n16-APSK, M = 16 and the number of states is 162L = 256L. The number of states grows rapidly with L. As an example L = 2 requires a trellis with 65,536 states. Consequently, L > 1 is impractical. Unfortunately, pulse shapes with good spectral containment are longer than 2 symbol times. For this reason, a non-optimal approach using L\u2032 < L is explored.\nA good value for L\u2032 depends on the properties of the pulse shape autocorrelation\nfunction. As an example, the pulse shape autocorrelation function x(t) for the square-root raised-cosine pulse shape with 50% excess bandwidth and a span of 12 symbols is plotted in Figure 2.2. Also shown in the figure are the samples of x(t) required to compute the summation over m in the branch metric (2.29) for \u2206\u03c4/Ts = 0, 0.1, and 0.2. Observations:\n19\n1. The samples required for \u2206\u03c4/Ts = 0 are shown by the white circles in the figure. Note\nthat all of these samples occur at the zero crossings of x(t). This is why the case for \u2206\u03c4/Ts = 0 reduces to the block-by-block decision rule in [11].\n2. The samples required for \u2206\u03c4/Ts = 0.1 are shown by the black circles in the figure.\nThe samples for m = 1 occur at t/Ts = \u00b11 + 0.1, \u00b12 + 0.1, \u00b13 + 0.1. The samples for m > 1 are well approximated by zero.\n3. The samples required for \u2206\u03c4/Ts = 0.2 are shown by the gray squares in the figure.\nThe samples for m = 1 occur at t/Ts = \u00b11 + 0.2, \u00b12 + 0.2, \u00b13 + 0.2. The samples for m > 1 are well approximated by zero.\nThis example demonstrates that L\u2032 = 1 is an excellent approximation for 0 \u2264 \u2206\u03c4 < Ts. As will be shown in Section 3.3, L\u2032 = 1 is a very good approximation that presents a desirable complexity/performance tradeoff as long as \u2206\u03c4/Ts is not too big. The assumption 0 \u2264 \u2206\u03c4 < Ts is supported by the size of test articles and bit rates commonly encountered in aeronautical mobile telemetry as explained in Section IV of [5]. The approximation L\u2032 = 0 is also explored in the next section.\nIt should be noted that as the excess bandwidth decreases, the temporal sidelobes of\nx(t) increase. A consequence of this is that for extremely low values of excess bandwidth, larger values of L\u2032 may be needed to realize good performance. Thus as spectral efficiency increases, complexity may also increase.\nFinally, A-STCBC can operate in the more general case represented by c0(t) and\nc1(t) in Figure 1.3. Here, the ML sequence estimator must operate on a trellis defined by the equivalent discrete-time channels. If the composite pulse shape and channel spans D symbols, then the ML sequence estimator must operate over a trellis with MD states. All but the simplest channels render this approach too computationally expensive."

            "text": "Computer simulations were performed to assess the bit error rate (BER) performance\nof the A-STBC system. For the simulations, the square-root raised-cosine pulse shape with\n20\n50% excess bandwidth and a span of 12 symbols (T1 = \u22126Ts, T2 = 6Ts) was used [13]. The 16-APSK constellation parameters were R2/R1 = 2.75, \u03b81 = \u03c0/4 and \u03b82 = \u03c0/12 (cf., Figure 1.4). The simulation uses (1.1) for the channels with g0 = +1 and g1 = \u22121. The phase difference of \u03c0 produces the deep nulls observed when transmitting the same signal from both antennas (i.e., \u201cthe two-antenna problem\u201d).\nThe BER simulation results for A-STBC for \u2206\u03c4 = 0.1Ts, 0.2Ts and for L \u2032 = 0, 1\nare plotted in Figure 2.3. Also shown in the figure for reference is the BER performance of uncoded 16-APSK in the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) environment. The abscissa is the received \u201cSNR\u201d \u03b121Eb/N0 where\n\u03b121 = |g0|2 + |g1|2. (2.31)\nThe pulse shape autocorrelation function xTs(\u2113Ts+\u2206\u03c4) is plotted in Figure 2.2. As explained earlier in this chapter, L\u2032 = 1 is a good approximation for this pulse shape as long as \u2206\u03c4 is not too large. The impact of this assumption on BER performance is shown in the figure.\n21\nFor \u2206\u03c4 = 0.1Ts, the BER performance loss (relative to the AWGN case) at 10 \u22125 is a fraction of a dB; for \u2206\u03c4 = 0.2Ts, the BER performance is only slightly worse. Investigating relatively small values for \u2206\u03c4 is justified by the geometry (size of typical test articles) and commonly encountered bit rates (5 to 20 Mbits/s) as explained in [5, Section IV]. The interesting feature here is that the approximation used for state reduction renders the BER performance a function of \u2206\u03c4 . This is because the approximation error grows as \u2206\u03c4 increases.\nAlso included in Figure 2.3 is the case L\u2032 = 0. This case ignores the memory from one\nAlamouti block to the next and eliminates the need for a sequence search. The simulation results show that removing the sequence detector profoundly impacts the BER performance: the performance loss is about 1.5 dB for \u2206\u03c4 = 0.1Ts. For \u2206\u03c4 = 0.2Ts, a BER floor at about 2.5\u00d7 10\u22124 is observed. (The floor occurs at higher values of received SNR than displayed in the plot.)\n22\nCHAPTER 3.

Substituting z(t) for z0(t) and z1(t) in (3.18) and (3.23) produces\nv0(t) = h \u2217 0(\u2212t) \u22c6 z0(t)\u2212 h1(t) \u22c6 z\u22171(\u2212t+ (2N \u2212 1)Ts + Tg)\n= h\u22170(\u2212t) \u22c6 z(t)\u2212 h1(t) \u22c6 z\u2217(\u2212t+ (2N \u2212 1)Ts + Tg \u2212 (NTs + Tg)) = h\u22170(\u2212t) \u22c6 z(t)\u2212 h1(t) \u22c6 z\u2217(\u2212t+ (N \u2212 1)Ts)\n= \u222b z(u)h\u22170(u\u2212 t)du\u2212 \u222b z\u2217(\u2212u\u2032 \u2212 Ts)h1(t\u2212 u\u2032)du\u2032\n(3.25)\nand\nv1(t) = h \u2217 1(\u2212t) \u22c6 z0(t) + h0(t) \u22c6 z\u22171(\u2212t+ (2N \u2212 1)Ts + Tg)\n= h\u22171(\u2212t) \u22c6 z(t) + h0(t) \u22c6 z\u2217(\u2212t+ (2N \u2212 1)Ts + Tg \u2212 (NTs + Tg)) = h\u22171(\u2212t) \u22c6 z(t) + h0(t) \u22c6 z\u2217(\u2212t+ (N \u2212 1)Ts)\n= \u222b z(u)h\u22171(u\u2212 t)du+ \u222b z\u2217(\u2212u\u2032 \u2212 Ts)h0(t\u2212 u\u2032)du\u2032.\n(3.26)\nFrom here, E{v0(t+ \u03c4)v\u22170(t)}, E{v1(t+ \u03c4)v\u22171(t)}, and E{v0(t+ \u03c4)v\u22171(t)} are solved for below.\n30\nSolving for E{v0(t+ \u03c4)v\u22170(t)}\nThe autocorrelation of v0(t) is\nE{v0(t+ \u03c4)v\u22170(t)}\n= E {[\u222b z(u)h\u22170(u\u2212 t\u2212 \u03c4)du\u2212 \u222b z\u2217(\u2212u\u2032 \u2212 Ts)h1(t+ \u03c4 \u2212 u\u2032)du\u2032 ] [\u222b\nz\u2217(\u03bb)h0(\u03bb\u2212 t)d\u03bb\u2212 \u222b z(\u2212\u03bb\u2032 \u2212 Ts)h\u22171(t\u2212 \u03bb\u2032)d\u03bb\u2032 ]} .

            "text": "In preparation for a discrete-time equalizer, Ts-spaced samples of y0(t) and y1(t) are\ntaken to produce\ny0(nTs) = N\u22121\u2211 k=0 J0(k) [x00((n\u2212 k)Ts) + x11((n\u2212 k)Ts)] + v0(nTs) (3.48) y1(nTs) = N\u22121\u2211 k=0 J1(k) [x00((n\u2212 k)Ts) + x11((n\u2212 k)Ts)] + v1(nTs). (3.49)\nThe Ts-spaced samples define a discrete-time equivalent channel relating the input symbol streams to the samples.\nEquation (3.48) defines the relationship between the sequence J0(n) and y0(nTs). The\nchannel relating the two is the equivalent channel\nheq(nTs) = x00(nTs) + x11(nTs). (3.50)\n35\nThe additive noise term in (3.48) is a vector of complex-valued normal random variables with zero mean and autocorrelation function\nE{v0((n+m)Ts)v\u22170(nTs)} = 2N0heq(mTs). (3.51)\nNote that only sequence J0(n) is involved in (3.48). Similarly, (3.49) defines the relationship between J1(n) and y1(nTs); the relationship is defined by the equivalent channel (3.50); and the additive noise is a vector of complex-valued normal random variables with identical statistics to those of v0(nTs).\nThe \u201corthogonalization\u201d of J0(n) and J1(n) is achieved by the cascade of the encoding\nand the procedure that produced y0(t) and y1(t) from r0(t) and r1(t). The orthogonalization can only be achieved if the received segments r0(t) and r1(t) do not possess any temporal overlap. This is the purpose of the guard interval Tg. The illustration in Figure 3.2 shows that the guard interval must satisfy\nTg + Ts \u2265 T2 \u2212 T1 + Tc. (3.52)\nThe guard interval must take into account not only the spreading due to the channel but also the temporal support of the pulse shape. The guard interval may be realized by inserting a blank period between the transmission in the first interval and the transmission in the second interval. Alternatively (and the preferred approach in AMT) a sequence of known symbols may be inserted between J0(N \u2212 1) and J0(N) and between J1(N \u2212 1) and J1(N) (cf., Figure 3.2). A guard interval of the same length must also be inserted between the end of transmission for J0(2N \u2212 1) and J1(2N \u2212 1) and first symbol of the subsequent block. This guard interval may be created in the same way as described above. Periodic insertion of the guard interval between subblocks and between blocks ensures that each subblock can be processed independently of both the other subblock in the same block or of subblocks in other blocks. This is why, in the analysis above, the detection of a single block is justified.\nThe parallel discrete-time equivalent channels define Ungerboeck observation models\nfor equalization and/or detection. A number of alternatives may be used.\n36\n\u2022 Maximum-likelihood detection of J0(n) from y0(nTs) may be performed using the\nViterbi algorithm described in [15]. Here, in the sense maximum likelihood sequence detection performs \u201cequalization,\u201d equalization and detection are performed simultaneously.\n\u2022 A filter-based equalizer [14] (such as the MMSE or decision feedback equalizer) whose\ndesign incorporates the noise correlation may be applied to create decision variables that are used by a simple symbol-by-symbol detector.\n\u2022 Noise whitening may be applied to the Ungerboeck observation model to create the\nForney observation model [16]. Maximum likelihood sequence detection using the Viterbi algorithm as described in [16] may be used to perform simultaneous equalization and detection.\n\u2022 A filter based-equalizer based on the Forney observation model may be used.\nThe same options apply to the equalization and detection of J1(n) from y1(nTs).\nOf special interest is the case where the channel impulse responses are given by (1.1).\nFrom Figure 1.3, it is shown that\nh0(t) = p(t) \u22c6 c0(t) = p(t) \u22c6 g0\u03b4(t\u2212 \u03c40) = g0p(t\u2212 \u03c40) h1(t) = p(t) \u22c6 c1(t) = p(t) \u22c6 g1\u03b4(t\u2212 \u03c41) = g1p(t\u2212 \u03c41) (3.53)\nwhere p(t) is the pulse shape and ci(t) is the channel.\nIncorporating delays into the pulse shape auto- or crosscorrelation function (3.15)\nand applying it to the simple delay case found in (1.1) yields\nx\u2113m(t\u2212 \u03c4\u2113 \u2212 \u03c4m) = h\u2113(t\u2212 \u03c4\u2113) \u22c6 h\u2217m(\u2212t+ \u03c4m)\n= g\u2113g \u2217 mp(t\u2212 \u03c4\u2113) \u22c6 p(\u2212t+ \u03c4m).\n(3.54)\n37\nApplying this to x00(t) and x11(t) gives\nx00(t) = h0(t) \u22c6 h \u2217 0(\u2212t)\n= g0p(t\u2212 \u03c40) \u22c6 g\u22170p(\u2212t\u2212 \u03c40) = |g0|2x\u2032(t\u2212 \u03c40 + \u03c40) = |g0|2x\u2032(t)\n(3.55)\nand\nx11(t) = h1(t) \u22c6 h \u2217 1(\u2212t)\n= g1p(t\u2212 \u03c41) \u22c6 g\u22171p(\u2212t\u2212 \u03c41) = |g1|2x\u2032(t\u2212 \u03c41 + \u03c41) = |g1|2x\u2032(t)\n(3.56)\nwhere x\u2032(t\u2212 \u03c4\u2113\u2212 \u03c4m) = p(t\u2212 \u03c4\u2113)\u22c6p(\u2212t+ \u03c4m) acts as the autocorrelation function without the channel gains g0 and g1. Thus it can be seen that the delays go away with the autocorrelation function of the channel pulse shape. From these findings, (3.48) and (3.49) become\ny0(t) = (|g0|2 + |g1|2) N\u22121\u2211 k=0 J0(k)x \u2032(t\u2212 kTs) + v0(t) (3.57)\ny1(t) = (|g0|2 + |g1|2) N\u22121\u2211 k=0 J1(k)x \u2032(t\u2212 kTs) + v1(t) (3.58)\nor\ny0(t) = N\u22121\u2211 k=0 I0(k)heq(t\u2212 kTs) + v0(t) (3.59)\ny1(t) = N\u22121\u2211 k=0 I1(k)heq(t\u2212 kTs) + v1(t). (3.60)\nwhere\nheq(t) = (|g0|2 + |g1|2)x\u2032(t). (3.61)\n38\nIf p(t) = \u03b4(t), then x00(t) = |g0|2\u03b4(t) and x11(t) = |g1|2\u03b4(t). The equivalent channel reduces to\nheq(t) = ( |g0|2 + |g1|2 ) \u03b4(t). (3.62)\nSince the equivalent channel is not dependent on the delays \u03c40 and \u03c41 at the input\nof the equalizer, there is no need for an equalizer in the simple delay case: the waveform partition and waveform decoding steps perform all the necessary pre-detection processing."

            "text": "Similar to the A-STBC system, computer simulations were performed to assess the\nbit error rate (BER) performance of the TR-STBC system. For the simulations, the squareroot raised-cosine pulse shape with 50% excess bandwidth and a span of 12 symbols (T1 =\n40\n\u22126Ts, T2 = 6Ts) was used [13]. The 16-APSK constellation parameters were R2/R1 = 2.75, \u03b81 = \u03c0/4 and \u03b82 = \u03c0/12 (cf., Figure 1.4). The first set of computer simulations use (1.1) for the channels with g0 = +1 and g1 = \u22121. The BER simulation results for TR-STBC are plotted in Figure 3.4. As before, the uncoded 16-APSK in the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) environment serves as a reference in the figure. The abscissa is the received \u201cSNR\u201d \u03b121Eb/N0 where \u03b1 2 1 is given by (2.31). Recall that for the channels (1.1), no equalizer is required: decisions are made directly on y0(nTs) and y1(nTs) for J0(n) and J1(n), respectively. The simulation results show no variation with \u2206\u03c4 . The TR-STBC results coincide with the AGWN results.\nMotivated by the excellent performance of TR-STBC over the channel pair (1.1), we\nexplore the more general case of simultaneous solutions to the two-antenna problem and multipath mitigation. To do this, a pair of channels measured on the Cords Road flight corridor at Edwards AFB are used in the computer simulations. The channel measurement experiments are described in [17]. Note that the channel pair used here is a member of the set of channel pairs examined in [18, Section IV.C]. The frequency responses C0(f) and\n41\nC1(f) for the two channels are plotted in Figure 3.5. This channel pair represents a worst case example in the sense that one of the channels [C1(f) in this case] has a null at the carrier frequency. A plot of heq(nTs), the channel seen by the equalizer, is shown in Figure 3.6. The bottom plot, the frequency response of the equivalent symbol-spaced channel, shows that the waveform partitioning and waveform combining steps produce an equivalent discretetime channel that varies by only 4 dB across the frequency band. This is not a challenging problem for a linear equalizer.\nThe equalizer used in the simulation results is a length-31 MMSE FIR filter [14]. The\nsimulation results are plotted in Figure 3.7. The abscissa is the received \u201cSNR\u201d \u03b122Eb/N0 where\n\u03b122 = \u221e\u2211\nn=\u2212\u221e\n|heq(nTs)|2 (3.69)\n42\nThe results show that the equalizer is able to remove the (not very severe) intersymbol interference caused by the equivalent discrete-time channel.\n43\n44\nCHAPTER 4. CONCLUSIONS\nTwo methods are presented for solving the two-antenna problem in aeronautical mo-\nbile telemetry for 16-APSK. The first method uses the Alamouti space-time block code. Because the delays from the two transmit antennas are different, the decoder/detector is a sequence detector. The maximum likelihood (ML) sequence detector was derived and shown to be too complex for a realistic implementation. A state reduction, realized through a simple approximation of the pulse shape autocorrelation function (as shown in Figure 2.2), was shown to provide good performance (measured by the loss in BER performance relative to the AWGN case) as long as the differential delay \u2206\u03c4 is not too big (Figure 2.3).\nThe second method applies Lindskog\u2019s time-reversed space-time block code. The\ndecoder treats the delays as channels to be equalized and comprises waveform manipulations followed by parallel equalizers operating on identical equivalent discrete-time channels. For the case where the channels are simple delays, the waveform manipulations alone solve the two-antenna problem as shown in Figure 3.4. TR-STBC is capable of handling more complex scenarios and was demonstrated to be effective at equalizing a pair of multipath channels measured at Edwards AFB (see Figure 3.7).\nThe importance of these results is that these encoding methods have been simulated\nfor other modulations that are continuous phase modulations, but they have not previously been simulated for 16-APSK. These methods have also not been explored in the presence of differential delays for linear phase modulations which occur in AMT.\nGiven the obvious complexity advantage of TR-STBC over A-STBC in the AMT\nsetting together with the fact that TR-STBC can easily handle more general situations, TR-STBC is the preferred solution to the two-antenna problem.\n45"
