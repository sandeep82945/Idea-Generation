    "abstractText": "Background This study investigated associations between climate variables (average temperature and cumulative rainfall), and El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and dengue\u2010like\u2010illness (DLI) incidence in two provinces (Western and Guadalcanal Provinces) in Solomon Islands (SI). Methods Weekly DLI and meteorological data were obtained from the Ministry of Health and Medical Services SI and the Ministry of Environment, Climate Change, Disaster Management and Meteorology from 2015 to 2018, respec\u2010 tively. We used negative binomial generalized estimating equations to assess the effects of climate variables up to a lag of 2 months and ENSO on DLI incidence in SI. Results We captured an upsurge in DLI trend between August 2016 and April 2017. We found the effects of average temperature on DLI in Guadalcanal Province at lag of one month (IRR: 2.186, 95% CI: 1.094\u20134.368). Rainfall had minor but consistent effect in all provinces. La Ni\u00f1a associated with increased DLI risks in Guadalcanal Province (IRR: 4.537, 95% CI: 2.042\u201310.083), whereas El Ni\u00f1o associated with risk reduction ranging from 72.8% to 76.7% in both provinces. Conclusions Owing to the effects of climate variability and ENSO on DLI, defining suitable and sustainable measures to control dengue transmission and enhancing community resilience against climate change in low\u2010 and middle\u2010 developed countries are important.",

Aedes aegypti and to a lesser degree, Ae. albopictus serve as vectors that transmit the dengue virus to the human body [1, 2]. An eight-fold increase over the last two decades, 5.2 million of dengue fever cases were reported in 2019 by the World Health Organization [3]. Despite being the most common vector-borne disease globally, the Western Pacific, Southeast Asia, and America are severely impacted by dengue infections, and Asia represents 70% of the global burden of dengue [3].\nSolomon Islands (SI), a lower-middle-income nation with almost 1000 islands resided by less than a million inhabitants [4], is listed as 155 out of 190 countries in human development category [5]. Various disease outbreaks have occurred in SI and have become a serious epidemiologic challenge for the country in recent years [6]. The high burden of dengue fever can be attributed *Correspondence: Yu\u2011Chun Wang ycwang@cycu.edu.tw; swingapple@gmail.com 1 Department of Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, 200 Chung\u2011Pei Road, Zhongli 320, Taiwan 2 Research Center for Environmental Changes, Academia Sinica, 128 Academia Road, Section 2, Nankang, Taipei 11529, Taiwan\nto unplanned urbanization, low sanitation practices, and lack of knowledge regarding dengue fever [7]. However, some studies have proposed that dengue fever transmission would not have been successful without favorable climate conditions [8].\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has projected intense extreme weather events in the future despite active climate mitigation efforts [9, 10]. These events may exacerbate the burden of dengue fever in the Asia\u2013Pacific [11]. A study from China has reported that dengue fever incidence is significantly associated with extremely high temperatures and rainfall [8]. A similar study conducted in Taiwan has suggested that temperature, rainfall, and sunshine hours play important roles in dengue transmission [12].\nOwing to regional complexity and proximity to the confluence of the inter-tropical convergence zone and South Pacific convergence zone, most of the big islands in SI, including Guadalcanal, experience high annual rainfall and low seasonality [13]. Rainfall in SI is highly correlated with the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle [14]. ENSO can be explained as an anomaly in sea surface temperature in the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 region with three phases, El Ni\u00f1o (hotter/drier), La Ni\u00f1a (cooler/wetter), and neutral phases. The amount of rainfall could increase twofold during La Ni\u00f1a relative to El Ni\u00f1o in Guadalcanal [13]. Moreover, it has been proven that ENSO can impact human health [15].\nDeveloping public health adaptation strategies are necessary to address the effects of climate change. With regard to dengue fever in SI, such actions require a better understanding of the association between climate hazards and disease incidence. Despite that the effects of climate variables on dengue fever [12] have been explored, a paucity of information related to how climate affects dengue fever in SI is inevitable because of health outcomes and meteorological data constraints. However, our study has successfully extracted dengue-like illness (DLI) incidence from the Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS) SI between 2015 and 2018. Using the Solomon Islands Syndromic Surveillance Report (SISS), this study investigates the associations between temperature, cumulative rainfall, and ENSO on vector-borne disease risks of DLI in SI."

We evaluated the risks for Guadalcanal and Western Province, separately, and then we replicated it by summing the cases from both provinces. The following model is considered: *\ndenotes for monthly average temperature # denotes for monthly cumulative rainfall We conducted a multivariate analysis that included monthly average temperature, and cumulative rainfall with lag structures of up to two months (0\u20132\u00a0months) to capture the delayed effects of risk factors on the disease rates for the whole year (Model 1).

The temporal trends of monthly minimum, average and maximum temperature, and cumulative rainfall of Guadalcanal Province and Western Province are depicted in Fig.\u00a03.\nMonthly average temperature, cumulative rainfall, and ENSO categories were included in the model for the estimation of the risk of DLI in SI according to the QIC values of combined cases from the two provinces (Supplementary Table S1). Table\u00a02 shows the lagged effects of monthly average temperature, cumulative rainfall, and the risk of DLI in SI. An increase of 1\u00a0\u00b0C monthly average temperature was associated with an increased risk of DLI in All Islands and Guadalcanal Province, and the highest risk was found in Guadalcanal Province at lag 1\u00a0 month (IRR: 2.186, 95% CI: 1.094\u20134.368). This study did not observe significant effects on Western Province. However, monthly average temperature had no significant\neffect on DLI risk after lag 2\u00a0 months (Supplementary Table S2).\nThis study found that population of SI was vulnerable to rainfall. A minor effect of cumulative rainfall was captured, with 0.001%\u20130.003% increase in risk every 10\u00a0mm increase of monthly cumulative rainfall, which was consistent across 2 Islands (Table\u00a0 2). The highest risk of cumulative rainfall was found in Guadalcanal Province at lag 1\u00a0month, with IRR of 1.003 (95% CI: 1.001\u20131.005). The effects of cumulative rainfall disappeared after lag zero in Guadalcanal and one month in Western Province and All Islands. Our results show there was no significant association between cumulative rainfall and DLI risk in SI when we extended the lag up to six months (Supplementary Table S2).\nTo further investigate the role of ONI index on DLI, we conducted a sub-analysis restricted to the ENSO category only (Fig.\u00a0 4 and Supplementary Table S3). Compared to the ENSO neutral category, El Ni\u00f1o category consistently reduced the risk of DLI in the studied area, with reductions\nranging from 72.8% to 76.7%. On the other hand, La Ni\u00f1a greatly increased the risk of DLI, and the highest association was found in Guadalcanal Province (IRR: 4.537, 95% CI: 2.042\u201310.083) and All Islands category (IRR: 3.386, 95% CI: 2.004\u20135.722).

            "text": "Climate is one of the overriding factors of the current dengue incidence situation and should not be underestimated [12]. To the best of our knowledge, evidence of the association between climatic factors and ENSO on DLI incidence in the Western Pacific region, especially\nSI, is lacking. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of temperature, rainfall, and ENSO (La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o) on the burden of DLI in SI. Our data capture a long dengue outbreak between 2016 and early 2017 with the highest peak on December 2016. The outbreak was noted with uncommon increase of DLI along with the confirmed cases of dengue in the Solomon Islands. A group of researchers identified that the massive outbreak in 2016\u201317 was mostly caused by DENV-2 [6].\nOur data were collected onsite from SI bureaus to conduct the analysis. In this study, we found that temperature had a significant effect on the risk of DLI in Guadalcanal Province and rainfall showed minor yet consistent effects on the islands. Moreover, the risk of La Ni\u00f1a on DLI was remarkably high in Guadalcanal Province, and protective effects were observed during the El Ni\u00f1o period in SI.\nTemperature is one of the most important climatic factors in dengue transmission. Temperature influences the life cycle (gonotrophic cycle, growth, and development rate) of mosquitoes and the development of pathogens inside a vector [22]. Warm temperatures can accelerate viral replication, shorten extrinsic incubation time and induce the biting rates of mosquitos [23]. An Indonesian study reported that temperature has a significant correlation with dengue hemorrhagic fever (r = 0.371,p = 0.040) [24]. Likewise, our study found that temperature was associated with increased risk of DLI in Guadalcanal Province.\nThe duration and quantity of rainfall are important to dengue transmission. Rainfall can provide favorable habitats for aquatic stages (e.g., larvae) and enhance their distribution [25, 26]. This situation may apply to Ae. albopictus to a greater extent rather than Ae. aegypti, which is better known to breed indoors [27]. A study in a tropical city-state of Singapore has shown that high rainfall has a significant effect on dengue transmission after 5\u00a0 weeks [28]. A study in Malaysia confirmed that accumulated rainfall would affect the dengue cases at a cumulative change of 21.45% (95% CI: 8.96, 51.37) with the highest effect delayed by 26\u201328\u00a0 days [29]. Likewise, a Taiwan study has reported that high rainfall can lead to an increase in dengue incidence at a specific time (lag 10-weeks) [25]. Meanwhile, excessive rainfall can flush mosquitoes\u2019 habitats in the short-term periods (< 5\u00a0 weeks), disrupting the survival and transmission of the dengue virus [25]. The plausible explanation to the lagged effect can be explained because of the incubation periods in hosts, including the aquatic and aerial stages of mosquitoes. In line with our study, we observed a positive relationship between rainfall and an increment in DLI risk across all regions. Our study indicated that the risk of rainfall should not be neglected in SI.\nTo date, ENSO is linked with extreme weather events (floods and drought) and is known to exacerbate vectorborne disease risks in areas where climate is associated with the ENSO cycle (2\u20137\u00a0 years), and disease prevention is insufficient [15, 30]. We observed that while DLI risks increased in Guadalcanal Province during the La Ni\u00f1a phase, the effects of El Ni\u00f1o varied between the two provinces. The nebulous relationship between dengue and La Ni\u00f1a is exemplified in our results by the positive association of dengue risks with precipitation and La Ni\u00f1a phase. Overall, SI experiences colder and higher precipitation during La Ni\u00f1a phase [14].\nAs an archipelagic nation, SI has mountainous regions as well as low-lying atolls scattered across the country. Meteorological Services Division in SI reported that the temperature tends to be uniform (very less seasonality) in most areas throughout the year, with a mean maximum temperature of approximately 2\u00a0 \u00b0C. The annual rainfall is between 3000 and 5000\u00a0 mm, and the greatest annual rainfall can reach up to 9000\u00a0mm at some elevated locations (Ministry of Environment [31). A report suggested that the SI rainfall historical data has an upward trend, whereas the annual rainfall is expected to increase with the intensity of extreme rainfall days in the islands [32]. Projected alteration to rainfall patterns will not necessarily create new threats to health sectors but will likely exacerbate the current situation. The government is encouraged to enhance measurement strategies to control mosquito breeding and the distributions and intensities of other infectious disease vectors.\nAlthough we have established insightful findings regarding the effects of climatic conditions on DLI in SI, this study has some limitations. First, owing to the paucity of long-term data, the empirical estimates of climatic effects on DLI may vary when more data are available. Second, climate condition is not the only risk factor for vector-borne diseases. Our study did not consider the present seroprevalence, herd immunity, secondary transmission, socioeconomic factors, environment and displacement of dengue serotypes. Secondary transmission is a complex situation, which is related to vector control, travel history, and dengue stereotype [33]. Furthermore, surveillance data defined the DLI according to the clinical presentation, and dengue fever can be asymptomatic [34]. Thus, unreported cases can underestimate the true extent of climate variability on the risk of DLI. A previous study conducted in the tropical city-state of Singapore has estimated that asymptomatic cases can be 19-fold [34].\nAdditionally, our research is an ecological study, and thus our findings cannot be generalized at the individual level. However, the results are based on the best available data collected from SI government bureaus.\nThe number of dengue cases and outbreaks have increased dramatically in SI; therefore, a seasonal forecasting system that can predict DLI incidence should be developed. Our study has offered information for decision-makers to initiate strong preventive health policies that support active dengue surveillance and monitor breeding sources. More information is recommended for the development of robust early warning systems."

In addition, precipitation and La Ni\u00f1a significantly affected the risk of DLI in SI.
