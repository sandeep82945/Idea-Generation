 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a longitudinal study following IM residents over several years to assess the long-term impacts of training disruptions during the pandemic on physician wellbeing, career trajectories, and preparedness for independent practice. 

2. Explore interventions such as increased mental health resources, modified duty hours, and curriculum changes that may mitigate resident burnout and improve wellbeing during times of crisis. Assess the effectiveness of these interventions.

3. Examine the factors that enabled some residency programs to maintain adequate supervision and protected education time during the pandemic. Identify best practices that can be implemented at other institutions. 

4. Investigate the experiences of specific underrepresented minority resident groups in more depth to better understand the drivers of increased discrimination during the pandemic. Develop targeted interventions to address systemic racism in medical training.

5. Conduct a cost-benefit analysis of providing hazard pay to residents during crises. Assess impacts on resident wellbeing, patient care, and healthcare costs. Provide data to inform policies on resident compensation during future healthcare system shocks.
