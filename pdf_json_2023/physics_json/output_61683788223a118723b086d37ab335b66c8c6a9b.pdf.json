    "abstractText": "In the present work, the optimization of extraction, emulsifying properties, and biological activities of polysaccharides from Lentinula edodes Sing (LES) were studied. The results showed LES polysaccharides extracted by hot water or ultrasonication are a group of \u03b2-glucan. Among all the samples, the one extracted by hot water showed the best emulsifying capacity. In addition, the results demonstrated that LES polysaccharide had strong scavenging activities in vitro on DPPH and ABTS radicals, which reached the highest level for the one extracted by 90 min ultrasonication (p < 0.05). Overall, Lentinula edodes Sing polysaccharides (LESPs) may have potential applications as emulsifying agents in food industries.",

            "text": "Lentinula, a genus of the family Marasmiaceae, which is best known for the edible and medicinal Lentinula edodes originating from East Asia, is widely cultivated in Asia, Europe, Australia, and North and South America [1,2]. Lentinula edodes is now the second most popular edible fungi in the world owing to its desirable taste and multiple functional activities [3]. One of the major ingredients which contribute to Lentinula edodes\u2019 bioactive function is the polysaccharide fraction, which has shown antioxidant, antibacterial, immunomodulatory, antitumor, and antiinflammation effects, etc. [4]. For example, M et al. extracted and isolated linear (1\u21926)-\u03b2-d-glucan G-1 from Lentinula edodes. The IC50 of 2.2-diphenyl;-1 picrylhydrazine (DPPH) is 183.8 \u00b5g/mL and its antioxidant activity is higher than other fungal polysaccharides [5]. Moreover, Murphy et al. found through an in vitro lung injury model that Lentinan effectively attenuated the production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1), while significantly increasing the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 [6]. HPLPS, another polysaccharide isolated and purified from the fruiting bodies of Lentinula edodes, and reduced the proliferation of HepG2 and HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner [7]. However, as a subfamily member of Lentinula, Lentinula edodes Sing (LES, referred to as \u201cMasang fungus\u201d in Chinese), is a kind of wild mushroom unique to Southwest China that grows on the dead branches of the Coriaria nepalensis Wall in spring and autumn [8,9]. LES has only been domesticated and planted in recent years, so there are few related studies, especially of its polysaccharides, which have not been studied [10,11]. The extraction of edible fungi polysaccharide using hot water is a conventional and simple method but it possesses some disadvantages like long extraction time, high energy requirement, and less extraction yield [12,13]. Ultrasoundassisted extraction (UAE) is currently considered an efficient and environmentally friendly method for extracting polysaccharides from various plant sources [14,15]. Ultrasonic waves can disrupt the edible fungi cell walls by the cavitation effect, resulting in the mass transfer\nFoods 2023, 12, 3289. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12173289 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2023, 12, 3289 2 of 17\nbetween the solvent and the material to extract [16]. However, polysaccharides in natural products are extracted with hot water and UAE, which have different molecular weights, chemical compositions, and molecular conformations, such as the presence and location of functional groups and linkage patterns [17,18]. There are parameters that significantly influence polysaccharide extraction efficiency and biological activity through different ultrasonic conditions, such as ultrasonic power [19]. The result is a difference in the physiological activities of polysaccharides derived from different extraction methods [20]. Currently, UAE has widely used the extraction process of polysaccharides from various natural products (such as mushrooms) to improve the yield of target compounds [16]. Alzorqi et al. reported on the polysaccharides obtained by UAE from the Ganoderma lucidum that have a higher molecular weight and a better branching degree, as well as better in vitro antioxidant activity compared to traditional hot water extraction [21]. The lentinan normally has a high molecular weight, ranging from 1.16 \u00d7 103 to 6.84 \u00d7 103 kDa, which includes glucose, galactose, mannose, and arabinose with different molar ratios [1]. Additionally, the polysaccharides that contained \u03b2-glycoside bonds or with low molecular weight showed higher antioxidant bioactivity than other fungal polysaccharides [5,22]. Until now, there is little information on the physiochemical characteristics and the functional activities of the LES polysaccharide. The polysaccharides were extracted through hot water extraction and UAE, after which four polysaccharides were obtained, namely H90, U10, U20, and U60. Through the use of chemical and structural characteristics, antioxidant activity, hypoglycemic activity, and antilipid digestion studies, it is expected to provide a theoretical basis for the LES polysaccharide."

However, the dark color of polysaccharides could be unfavorable to the quality of food, and dark-colored polysaccharides should be avoided. Table 3 shows the color differences of the polysaccharide freeze-dried powder obtained at different ultrasonic treatment times during the polysaccharide extraction process. The ultrasonic treatment times significantly influenced the color (p < 0.05). The highest whiteness index is the ultrasonic treatment for 20 min (82.96 \u00b1 0.37), and the darkest color is the ultrasonic treatment for 60 min (79.91 \u00b1 0.25). The difference in the color of extracted polysaccharides might be related to the length of the sonication time of the extraction process. The ultrasonic treatment can contribute to the whiteness index. With the increase of ultrasonic time, the temperature of the center of the system gradually increases, which promotes the progress of chemical reactions such as Maillard reactions. Eventually, the polysaccharide darkens in color. Furthermore, the total color difference (\u2206E*) between the standard color plate and polysaccharide samples was calculated; it was observed that the smaller the whiteness index, the larger the value of \u2206E*.\nData are expressed as the means \u00b1 standard deviation of at least three independent replicates.

All these peaks are characteristics of polysaccharides. Peaks at 3380 and 2931 cm\u22121 are connected to the absorption of the O\u2013H and C\u2013H stretching vibration, respectively [20]. The absorption peak at 1632 cm\u22121 was attributed to the C=O bond, while the peak at 1407 cm\u22121 was attributed to the C\u2013H stretching vibration of the aldehyde group [3,37]. The results were consistent with the results of the monosaccharide composition analysis, which confirmed that the four polysaccharides contained glucuronic acid. In this region of 1028\u20131246 cm\u22121, weak peaks can be attributed to the stretching vibration of the C\u2013O\u2013C or C\u2013O\u2013H group and indicated that pyran rings could be present in these polysaccharides [42].

Effects of LES Polysaccharides on Lipolysis\nReducing the speed rate and extent of lipid digestion within the small intestine is an\neffective strategy for the treatment of postprandial spikes in blood lipid levels that occur\nafter the intake of high-fat foods [41]. We, therefore, examined the effect of LESP on lipid\ndigestion. As revealed by the iodine-potassium iodide experiment, our polysaccharide\nsamples do not contain starch. In addition, since the lipase activity in the gastric lumen is\nsignificantly lower than that in the duodenal tract, assays in the oral and gastric phases\ncan be omitted [41,56]. The relationship between the release degree of free fatty acids in\nthe reaction system and the digestion time was detected by the titration method during\nthe incubation in the intestinal stage, to judge the influence of polysaccharides on the rate\nand degree of lipid digestion. The lipolysis of emulsions in the presence and absence of\nLESPs is shown in Figure 8B. Overall, FFA release increased rapidly at the onset of lipol-\nysis and, then, gradually increased over time. At 120 min, the final degree of lipid diges-\ntion was as follows: 77.87 \u00b1 1.27%, 65.21 \u00b1 0.63%, 64.94 \u00b1 1.79%, 53.17 \u00b1 1.43%, and 54.75 \u00b1\n0.56% for the control, H90, U10, U20, and U60 samples, respectively. Lipid digestibility\nand extent were significantly reduced in the presence of lentinan compared to the control\ngroup (p < 0.05).\n4. Conclusions\nA novel source of polysaccharide from Lentinula edodes Sing (LES) was obtained using\nhot water extraction and ultrasonication for different intervals. According to the results of\nCongo red, iodine-potassium iodide, and infrared spectrum, all four polysaccharides have\nrich branched chain structures and three-dimensional helical structures with similar FT-\nIR spectra. Moreover, it revealed that the extraction condition could significantly (p < 0.05)\naffect the extraction yield and emulsifying properties, as well as other physiochemical and\nbiological properties of LES polysaccharide. To be specific, the polysaccharides obtained\nby hot water extraction showed a stronger emulsifying ability and stability, as well as\nstronger hypoglycemic activity in vitro. On the other hand, ultrasonication exhibited a\npositive impact on the antioxidant capacity of LES polysaccharides when the interval was\nextended from 10 to 60 min. In addition, ultrasonication increased the resistance of poly-\nsaccharides to lipid digestion.

            "text": "Reducing the speed rate and extent of lipid digestion within the small intestine is an effective strategy for the treatment of postprandial spikes in blood lipid levels that occur after the intake of high-fat foods [41]. We, therefore, examined the effect of LESP on lipid digestio . As revealed by the iodine-potassium iodide experiment, our polysaccharide samples do not contain starc . In addition, since the lipase activity in the gast ic lumen is significantly lower than that in the uode al tract, assays in the oral and gastric phases can be omitted [41,56]. The relationship between the release degree of free fatty acids in the reaction system and the digestion time was detected by the titration method during the incubation in the intestinal stage, to judge the influence of polysaccharides on the rate and degree of lipid digestion. The lipolysis of emulsions in the presence and absence of LESPs is shown in Figure 8B. Overall, FFA release increased rapidly at the onset of lipolysis and, then, gradually increased over time. At 120 min, the final degree of lipid digestion was as follows: 77.87 \u00b1 1.27%, 65.21 \u00b1 0.63%, 64.94 \u00b1 1.79%, 53.17 \u00b1 1.43%, and 54.75 \u00b1 0.56% for the control, H90, U10, U20, and U60 samples, respectively. Lipid digestibility and extent were significantly reduced in the presence of lentinan compared to the control group (p < 0.05)."

            "text": "A novel source of polysaccharide from Lentinula edodes Sing (LES) was obtained using hot water extraction and ultrasonication for different intervals. According to the results of Congo red, iodine-potassium iodide, and infrared spectrum, all four polysaccharides have rich branched chain structures and thr e-di ensional helical structures with similar FT-IR spectra. Moreover, it revealed that the extraction condition could significa tly (p < 0.05) affect the extraction yield and emulsifying properties, as well as other physiochemical and biological properties of LES polysaccharide. To be specific, the polysaccharides obtained by hot water extraction showed a stronger emulsifying ability and stability, as well as stronger hypoglycemic activity in vitro. On the other hand, ultrasonication exhibited a positive impact on the antioxidant capacity of LES polysaccharides when the interval was extended from 10 to 60 min. In addition, ultrasonication increased the resistance of polysaccharides to lipid digestion. The present study showed that Lentinula edodes Sing can be a great potential s urce of polysac har des, especially the one extracted by hot water for hydrocolloids.\nFoods 2023, 12, 3289 15 of 17\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, L.W.
