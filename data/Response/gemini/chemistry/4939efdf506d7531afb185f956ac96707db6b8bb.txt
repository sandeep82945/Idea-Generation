1. **Investigate the effect of protein size and shape on adsorption behavior.** The study focused on globular proteins of a specific size and shape. It would be interesting to explore how the adsorption behavior changes for proteins of different sizes and shapes, such as elongated or irregularly shaped proteins.

2. **Examine the role of protein-protein interactions in adsorption.** The study assumed that protein-protein interactions were negligible. However, in reality, protein-protein interactions can play a significant role in adsorption behavior. Future research could investigate how protein-protein interactions affect the rate and extent of adsorption.

3. **Study the effect of surface chemistry on adsorption behavior.** The study used a simple implicit wall model to represent the surface. However, in reality, surfaces can have complex chemistries that can affect protein adsorption. Future research could investigate how different surface chemistries affect the adsorption behavior of proteins.

4. **Develop a more detailed model of protein adsorption.** The study used a coarse-grained model to represent proteins and the surface. While this model captured the essential features of protein adsorption, a more detailed model could provide more accurate predictions of adsorption behavior. Future research could develop a more detailed model that includes atomistic details of proteins and the surface.

5. **Apply the model to real-world systems.** The study focused on a simplified model system. However, the model could be applied to real-world systems to predict protein adsorption behavior in various applications, such as drug delivery, biosensors, and biofouling. Future research could apply the model to real-world systems to gain insights into protein adsorption behavior in these applications.
