    "abstractText": "Recent works argue that the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking in QCD-like theories can be derived from supersymmetric (SUSY) QCD with perturbation of anomalymediated SUSY breaking (AMSB). Nevertheless, despite the fact that AMSB needs to be a small (but still exact) perturbation, two other major problems remain unsolved: first, in order to derive the chiral symmetry breaking pattern, one needs to minimize the potential along a certain specific direction, identifying this direction fully as an outcome is nontrivial given the moduli space of degenerate vacua in the SUSY limit; second, when SUSY is broken, non-holomorphic states might emerge and be relevant for determining the vacuum structure. In this work, we try to resolve these problems and discuss their physical implications. For this purpose, we focus on SUSY QCD with Nf \u2264 Nc+1 and perturb the theories using AMSB. Without minimizing the potential along a certain specific direction in the moduli space, we successfully derive the expected chiral symmetry breaking pattern when Nf < Nc. However, when Nf = Nc and Nf = Nc+1, we show that tree-level AMSB would induce runaway directions, along which baryon number is spontaneously broken, and the vacua with broken baryon number can be deeper while the field values are not far from the origin. This implies that phase transitions and/or non-holomorphic physics are necessary. In order to derive the expected chiral symmetry breaking pattern of non-SUSY QCD starting from the SUSY limit and AMSB, baryon number conservation is needed as an input rather than obtained as an output. Moreover, we perform explicit consistency checks on \u201cultraviolet insensitivity\u201d for different Nf by adding the holomorphic mass term for the last flavor, we find that the \u201cjump\u201d of AMSB potential indeed matches the contribution from the holomorphic mass term. We also show in general that, when tree-level AMSB is not vanishing, the origin of the moduli space in s-confining theories does not persist as a minimum.",

            "text": "Gauge theories are central in describing the fundamental interactions of nature. For instance, the Standard Model of particle physics is constructed based on gauge theories, and it is verified experimentally as a great triumph. Nevertheless, our understanding on gauge theories is limited: once the theory becomes strongly-coupled, a large portion of the predicting power is lost. For example, in the case of QCD, no one can derive confinement or chiral symmetry breaking from first principles, even though they are widely believed to be true in describing the theory at low energy. Therefore, the infrared phases of strongly-coupled gauge theories are in general mysterious, and trying to understand them is of great importance.\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 1 6 The understanding on strongly-coupled gauge theories can greatly be improved with the presence of supersymmetry (SUSY). For instance, in N = 1 SUSY QCD, the ground state (or the vacuum) of the theory has been conjectured by Seiberg [1, 2]. Thanks to the power of holomorphy and the existence of many global symmetries and the moduli space, Seiberg\u2019s result is argued to be exact, and it passes many nontrivial consistency checks. See e.g. refs. [3\u20135] for pedagogical introductions on this topic. Shortly after Seiberg\u2019s breakthrough, many other exact results are also worked out, e.g. [6\u201313]. One might be tempted to ask whether it is possible to \u201cderive\u201d the properties of the ground state of non-SUSY confining gauge theories by adding SUSY-breaking effects to the exact results in SUSY gauge theories. Some early attempts in this line can be found in refs. [14\u201320], where the SUSY-breaking effects are assumed to be perturbations, namely the SUSYbreaking scale is required to be infinitesimal compared to the dynamical scale, and it is hoped that there is no phase transition when the SUSY-breaking is extrapolated to large values.1 In particular, some general results [18\u201321] are known on how to map small nonholomorphic SUSY-breaking soft terms from ultraviolet to infrared, where one always finds tachyonic directions for the soft masses of the bosonic component of the chiral superfields, this renders the determination of the ground state of near-SUSY theories nontrivial. In contrast, ref. [22] recently argues that one can successfully obtain the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking of non-SUSY QCD by perturbing the exact results of SUSY QCD [1, 2] with anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) [23, 24]. Within the framework of AMSB, SUSY breaking is only mediated via the superconformal anomaly [23, 24]. It was argued that AMSB is suitable for perturbing strongly-coupled SUSY gauge theories, such as SUSY QCD [22, 25],2 mainly thanks to the property called \u201cultraviolet insensitivity\u201d.3 Comparing to AMSB, the approach of mapping soft masses [18\u201321] is also exact despite that the theory can be strongly-coupled at infrared and the analysis can be done with general soft masses. On the other hand, AMSB is beyond just mapping soft terms, namely AMSB is sensitive to all the sources that break conformal invariance, including e.g. dimensionful parameters in higher dimensional operators in the low-energy dynamical superpotential, which is important in determining the vacuum structure. It might be useful to clarify the following facts before we get into further details. Here SUSY QCD and AMSB are thought of as pure theoretical tools, from which one might hope to learn about the standard non-SUSY QCD. This does not necessarily suggest that SUSY and AMSB are part of reality, namely that QCD is actually embedded in SUSY QCD, in which the SUSY-breaking scale needs to be much larger than the dynamical scale (since we did not discover gluinos or squarks yet). On the other hand, if SUSY is indeed part of reality, it might also get broken by non-holomorphic soft mass terms, which however are not under good control. In this work, we will treat SUSY and AMSB as theoretical tools.\n1Instead, if one finds that the ground state of the theory, where SUSY-breaking scale is small, is different from the one in the non-SUSY limit, then one proves that phase transitions must exist when the SUSYbreaking scale is extrapolated from zero to infinity.\n2See also refs. [26\u201330] for application of this approach to other theories. 3However, notice that \u201cultraviolet insensitivity\u201d can possibly fail if the heavy threshold is set by some vacuum expectation values of singlet scalar fields. This was firstly pointed out in ref. [31] and later on denoted as \u201cdeflected anomaly mediatation\u201d in ref. [32]. See also refs. [33, 34] for related studies of AMSB in SUSY gauge theories. We will come back to this point in section 3.\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 1 6\nThe results obtained in ref. [22] are encouraging and it inspires us to apply AMSB to study SUSY confining gauge theories in more details. Before that, there are still some doubts that remain unclarified to us when applying AMSB to SUSY QCD. In particular, it is only shown that the chiral symmetry breaking pattern can be obtained by minimizing the full potential with AMSB along the specific directionMij \u221d \u03b4ij , whereMij is the meson chiral superfield and i, j are the flavor indices. A priori, this might not necessarily be the case.\n1. In particular, this problem becomes relevant for SUSY QCD with 3Nc > Nf \u2265 Nc: when Nf = Nc and Nf = Nc + 1, the quantum-mechanical moduli space exists at low energy (despite the origin is smoothed out in the case of Nf = Nc); when Nc + 1 < Nf < 3Nc, the low energy limit is described by the dual magnetic theory, which also has a nontrivial moduli space. It is a nontrivial question to identify which direction (or one point) in the moduli space to perturb using AMSB. In general, one needs to take care of the entire moduli space and it is a nontrivial task to verify the global minimum aligns in the direction Mij \u221d \u03b4ij .\n2. The problem is more severe if deeper minima or runaway directions are found along the directions where baryon number might get spontaneously broken. If this is the case, phase transitions are necessary when SUSY-breaking parameter is extrapolated to large values, in order to avoid contradiction with the Vafa-Witten theorem [35] in the non-SUSY limit. Notice that our logic is different from that of ref. [22], namely we do not assume there is continuity between SUSY and non-SUSY limits. Rather, we show that continuity is not true if SUSY and non-SUSY limits are not consistent with each other.\nOn top of the \u201cvacuum alignment\u201d problem as discussed above, another potential problem is that extra (massless) degrees of freedom, which do not appear in the exact SUSY limit, might emerge once SUSY is broken.4 Similarly, condensates which are forbidden in the exact SUSY limit might also form due to strong dynamics in the non-SUSY limit. This kind of effects cannot be fully captured by perturbing the SUSY result, and there are technical difficulties to quantify these effects precisely. In this work, we will try to clarify these problems and discuss related physical implications. The structure of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we analyze in details the ground state of SUSY QCD perturbed by AMSB when Nf \u2264 Nc + 1.5 Special attention is given to the cases of Nf = Nc and Nf = Nc + 1, where the problems depicted above indeed appear, phase transitions are argued to be necessary between the slightly broken SUSY QCD and the standard non-SUSY QCD. The result of Nf < Nc is also given for completeness. In section 3, we check explicitly the property of \u201cultraviolet insensitivity\u201d, by adding a holomorphic mass to the last flavor. We show that the jump of AMSB potential matches the contribution from the holomorphic mass term. In section 4, we discuss\n4For example, \u201cexotic\u201d massless composite fermions (i.e. the pentaquark state q\u0304qqqq in QCD) are forbidden in SUSY QCD, but they are in general allowed in non-SUSY QCD and relevant for \u2019t Hooft anomaly matching [36].\n5We assume Nc \u2265 3 in the following. For Nc = 2 there is no distinction between quarks and antiquarks, similar analysis can be carried out in this case.\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 1 6\nin general perturbing smoothly confining (s-confining) theories with AMSB. We show, if tree-level AMSB potential is not vanishing, the origin of the moduli space cannot persist as a minimum. In section 5, we conclude and briefly discuss future directions. In appendix A, we review AMSB and understand its physical consequences following spurion analysis. In appendix B, we collect some technical details.\n2 Disassembling the exact results of QCD-like theories when Nf \u2264 Nc+1\nIn this section, we examine whether the chiral symmetry breaking pattern\nSU(Nf )L \u00d7 SU(Nf )R \u00d7U(1)B \u2192 SU(Nf )V \u00d7U(1)B (2.1)\ncan be obtained fully as an output of minimizing the full potential, which is the sum of SUSY potential and AMSB potential, when the SUSY-breaking scalem is small. For canonical chiral superfields \u03c6i, the SUSY potential and tree-level AMSB potential are given as\nVSUSY = \u2211 i \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202W\u2202\u03c6i \u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 , (2.2)\nand VAMSB = m (\u2211 i \u03c6i \u2202W \u2202\u03c6i \u2212 3W ) + h.c. , (2.3)\nwhere W is superpotential. Readers who are not familiar with AMSB are encouraged to read appendix A, where we briefly review AMSB in the context of SUSY QCD and discuss its physical consequences using spurion analysis. As mentioned in the introduction, we do not assume the specific direction (i.e. Mij \u221d \u03b4ij) along which the full potential is minimized. Instead we try to analyze the entire moduli space and check whether Mij \u221d \u03b4ij can be obtained as an output, rather than being needed as an input."

            "text": "In the SUSY limit, the classical moduli space is uplifted by the dynamical Affleck-DineSeiberg (ADS) superpotential [37] at low energy, and the true vacuum is pushed to infinity in the field space of Mij \u2261 QiQ\u0303j , where Qi and Q\u0303i are the quark chiral superfields with the flavor indices being i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Nf .

Here we choose to keep \u039b explicitly for concreteness. In spurion analysis, \u039b is promoted to a chiral superfield which carries non-vanishing charges of anomalous U(1) symmetries (such as axial U(1)A symmetry). So it is better to keep \u039b explicitly. Anyway, within this section, for the purpose of minimizing the potential, we will treat \u039b as a real variable, as one can always use the anomalous symmetry to make it real.\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 1 6\nloss of generality. Nevertheless, being different from the analysis in ref. [22] and motivated by ref. [16], we do not a priori assume Mij \u221d \u03b4ij , instead we will prove this is true by minimizing the total potential.\nOne can derive the potential from ADS superpotential as VSUSY = |\u039b|2 \u2211 i | \u2202W\u2202Mi |\n2 in the SUSY limit, and the result is\nVSUSY = |\u039b| 2\u00b7\n3Nc\u2212Nf Nc\u2212Nf +2 \u00b7 Nf\u220f i=1\n1\n|Mi| 2 Nc\u2212Nf \u00b7 Nf\u2211 i=1 1 |Mi|2 , (2.5)\nwhere the K\u00e4hler potential is assumed to be canonical in Mi/\u039b (since Mi has mass dimension two) for simplicity, and this is expected to be true near the origin, i.e. when the theory is strongly coupled. In the region far away from the origin, it is known the theory is weakly coupled and the K\u00e4hler potential is canonical in Qi and Q\u0303i. It is easy to see VSUSY has runaway vacua, i.e. it gets minimized when Mi \u2192 \u221e. With perturbations from AMSB, the theory is likely to be in the weakly coupled regime when the SUSY-breaking scale is infinitesimal. We will come back to this point later.\nOn top of the SUSY potential, one also obtains the AMSB potential:\nVAMSB = m (2Nf \u2212 3Nc) \u039b 3Nc\u2212Nf Nc\u2212Nf Nf\u220f i=1 Mi \u2212 1Nc\u2212Nf + h.c.

The true ground state can be found by minimizing V = VSUSY + VAMSB , which is a function of |Mi|.\nFor the purpose of minimizing V , it is useful to parametrize\nMi = xiM , \u220f i xi = 1 , (2.8)\nsuch that detM = MNf . Therefore, V depends on xi only through\nV \u2283 |\u039b|2\u00b7 3Nc\u2212Nf Nc\u2212Nf +2 |M | \u22122Nf Nc\u2212Nf \u22122 Nf\u2211 i=1 1 |xi|2 , (2.9)\nwhich is minimized when |x1| = |x2| = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = |xNf | = 1. (2.10)\nThe condition Mij \u221d \u03b4ij assumed in ref. [22] is justified, up to the phases of various xi removable by chiral symmetry transformations. With AMSB, we see |M | 6= 0 at the minimum, i.e. the vacuum expectation value is given by\n|M | = (\u22122Nf + 3Nc\nNc\n) Nc\u2212Nf \u22122Nc+Nf\nm \u2212 Nc\u2212Nf 2Nc\u2212Nf \u039b 5Nc\u22123Nf 2Nc\u2212Nf \u039b2 , when m \u039b , (2.11)\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 1 6\ntherefore the chiral symmetry breaking pattern\nSU(Nf )L \u00d7 SU(Nf )R \u00d7U(1)B \u2192 SU(Nf )V \u00d7U(1)B (2.12)\nis derived without any additional assumptions. When the SUSY-breaking scale is extrapolated from zero to infinity, the vacuum expectation value of M is getting closer and closer to the origin, i.e. the theory is extrapolated from the Higgs phase to confining phase. Since quarks/squarks transform under the fundamental representation of the gauge group, the extrapolation is expected to be smooth, although the existence of phase transition is a logical possibility. We obtain the same conclusion as in ref. [22]. As we mentioned before, the only loophole could be K\u00e4hler potential, it is canonical in Q and Q\u0303 rather then in M in the weakly coupled regime. So the above result can only be trusted qualitatively. To clarify this point, we redo the above analysis for squark fields Q and Q\u0303, see appendix B for details. We find the same result as above. In conclusion, we derive chiral symmetry breaking in QCD-like theories when Nf < Nc by minimizing the full potential, where the SUSY-breaking scale needs to be small. Compared to ref. [22], the novelty of our analysis is that we do not assume Mij = \u03c62\u03b4ij (where \u03c6 is the squark field with canonical K\u00e4hler potential in the weakly coupled regime) from the beginning; rather, we prove it is true at the minimum, and therefore the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking as well."

            "text": "In the SUSY limit, the low energy theory is believed to be characterized by the meson and baryon chiral superfields (i.e. Mij and B, B\u0303) with the superpotential [1]\nW = \u03b1 (detM \u2212BB\u0303 \u2212 \u039b2Nc) , (2.13)\nwhere \u03b1 is the Lagrange multiplier, whose equation of motion gives rise to the vacua:\ndetM \u2212BB\u0303 \u2212 \u039b2Nc = 0 , (2.14)\ni.e. the origin of the classical moduli space is smoothed out by quantum-mechanical effects. This is dubbed as \u201cquantum modified moduli space\u201d, where all the vacua satisfy \u2019t Hooft anomaly matching conditions [1]. We assume that the K\u00e4hler potential is regular in meson and baryon chiral superfields, at least this is believed to be true close to the origin. When the K\u00e4hler potential is canonical, the superpotential is found to be\nW = \u03b1 ( \u03bb1\ndetM \u039bNf\u22122\n\u2212 \u03bb2BB\u0303 \u2212 \u039b2 ) , (2.15)\nwhere \u03bb1,2 are dimensionless but uncalculable coefficients related to the wave function renormalization of the meson and baryon fields. Nevertheless, one can rely on naive dimensional analysis (NDA) to estimate the orders of magnitude of these coefficients [38, 39]. When AMSB is turned on, one can calculate the potential from eq. (2.15), where U(1)R symmetry of SUSY QCD is explicitly broken. Since the degeneracy of the vacua in moduli\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 1 6\nspace is accidental in the SUSY limit, it is expected that degeneracy would be broken with perturbations of AMSB. It is useful to divide the discussion of minimizing the potential according to the rank of meson superfield M . When rank(M) = Nf , the chiral symmetry SU(Nf )L \u00d7 SU(Nf )R is spontaneously broken, \u2019t Hooft anomalies are expected to be matched with NambuGoldstone bosons; on the other hand, when rank(M) < Nf , it is possible that part of the chiral symmetry remains unbroken, massless fermions are necessary for \u2019t Hooft anomaly matching. This imposes nontrivial constraints on the sub-manifold of the fields Mij and B, B\u0303, within which the potential gets minimized. A priori, we cannot determine whether baryon number is spontaneously broken or not, it would be interesting to see whether one can derive baryon number conservations as an output of minimizing the full potential together with AMSB.\n2.2.1 rank(M) = Nf\nFrom the superpotential in eq.

When B = 0, we can easily see that the total potential is minimized with B\u0303 = 0, and vice versa. This can be understood as b = 0.

(2.22) back into V , we find the dependence of V on k is\nV = 2|\u03bb2||\u03b1|2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u039b2 \u2212 \u03bb1 M\u0302Nf\u039bNf\u22122 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 k + (1\u2212 k)2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u039b2 \u2212 \u03bb1 M\u0302Nf\u039bNf\u22122 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nWithout considering the constraint 0 \u2264 k \u2264 1, the potential is minimized at\nk\u2217 = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u039b2 \u2212 \u03bb1 M\u0302Nf\u039bNf\u22122 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2212 |\u03bb2||\u03b1|2\u2223\u2223\u2223\u039b2 \u2212 \u03bb1 M\u0302Nf\u039bNf\u22122 \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 1 . (2.23) Nevertheless, since the values of\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u039b2 \u2212 \u03bb1 M\u0302Nf\u039bNf\u22122 \u2223\u2223\u2223 and |\u03bb2||\u03b1|2 are unfixed, k\u2217 can be positive or negative. Therefore, there are two possibilities: k\u2217 \u2264 0 and k\u2217 > 0, as we discuss the minimization in details in the following.\nDirection with unbroken baryon number. When k\u2217 \u2264 0 (i.e. \u2223\u2223\u2223\u039b2 \u2212 \u03bb1 M\u0302Nf\u039bNf\u22122 \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 |\u03bb2||\u03b1|2), the full potential is minimized at k = 0. According to eq. (2.22), we find at this minimum baryon field has vanishing vacuum expectation value, i.e.\nb2 = 0 , (2.24)\nand the potential gets simplified to\nV \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 b2=0 = \u039b4 + |\u03bb1|2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 M\u03022Nf\u039b2Nf\u22124 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2212 2 |\u03bb1| \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 M\u0302Nf\u039bNf\u22124 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 cos(Nf\u03b8M ) +Nf |\u03bb1|2|\u03b1|2 \u2223\u2223\u2223M\u0302 \u2223\u2223\u22232Nf\u22122 |\u039b|2Nf\u22124\n+ 2 m (Nf \u2212 2) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03bb1\u039bNf\u22122 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 |\u03b1||M\u0302 |Nf cos(\u03b8\u03b1 +Nf\u03b8M ) + 4m|\u039b|2|\u03b1| cos(\u03b8\u03b1) . (2.25) Note that the above potential is also valid at the limit when \u039b2 \u2212 \u03bb1 M\u0302 Nf\n\u039bNf\u22122 = 0, where\nminimization also gives b2 = 0. By solving \u2202|\u03b1|V = 0 and \u2202|M |V = 0 order by order in powers of the SUSY-breaking scale m, we find the potential is minimized at\n\u03b8\u03b1 = \u03c0, \u03b8M = 0, |\u03b1| = m |\u03bb1|2/Nf ' m4\u03c0 , |M\u0302 | = \u039b |\u03bb1|1/Nf ' \u039b\u221a 4\u03c0 , (2.26)\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 1 6\nand at this minimum the potential value is\nVmin = \u2212Nfm2\u039b2|\u03bb1| \u2212 2 Nf ' \u2212Nfm 2\u039b2\n4\u03c0 , (2.27)\nwhere NDA implies \u03bb1 ' (4\u03c0)Nc/2 [38, 39]. This is the minimum identified in ref. [22], where the chiral symmetry breaking pattern\nSU(Nf )L \u00d7 SU(Nf )R \u00d7U(1)B \u2192 SU(Nf )V \u00d7U(1)B\nis reproduced. Nevertheless, up to the present stage, one cannot guarantee that this is the global minimum, other deeper minima with different symmetry-breaking patterns may also exist. Identifying those other minima would also be an important part of deriving chiral symmetry breaking.\nDirection with broken baryon number. When k\u2217 > 0 (i.e. \u2223\u2223\u2223\u039b2 \u2212 \u03bb1 M\u0302Nf\u039bNf\u22122 \u2223\u2223\u2223 > |\u03bb2||\u03b1|2), the full potential is minimized at k = k\u2217. When \u03b1 = 0, the full potential is semi-positive definite (i.e. V \u2265 0), so the full potential with AMSB cannot be minimized at \u03b1 = 0. In the following we consider |\u03b1| > 0, so\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u039b2 \u2212 \u03bb1 M\u0302Nf\u039bNf\u22122 \u2223\u2223\u2223 > 0. In this case, according to eq. (2.22), we find baryon number is spontaneously broken, i.e. the vacuum expectation value of the baryon field is\n|b|2 = 1 |\u03bb2| (\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u039b2 \u2212 \u03bb1 M\u0302Nf\u039bNf\u22122 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2212 |\u03bb2||\u03b1|2 ) (2.28)\nfor any fixed values of M\u0302 and \u03b1 which satisfy \u2223\u2223\u2223\u039b2 \u2212 \u03bb1 M\u0302Nf\u039bNf\u22122 \u2223\u2223\u2223 > |\u03bb2||\u03b1|2. After plugging in the vacuum expectation value of the baryon field (i.e. k = k\u2217), the full potential becomes\nV = \u2212|\u03bb2|2|\u03b1|4 + 2|\u03bb2||\u03b1|2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u039b2 \u2212 \u03bb1 M\u0302Nf\u039bNf\u22122 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223+Nf |\u03bb1|2|\u03b1|2 |M\u0302 |2Nf\u22122\u039b2Nf\u22124 + 2m(Nf \u2212 2)|\u03b1||M\u0302 |Nf \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03bb1\u039bNf\u22122 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 cos(\u03b8\u03b1 +Nf\u03b8M ) + 4m|\u03b1||\u039b|2 cos(\u03b8\u03b1) , (2.29)\nwhich is minimized at \u03b8\u03b1 = \u03c0 and \u03b8M = 0 for any fixed but non-vanishing field values of |\u03b1| and |M\u0302 |. We find the chiral symmetry breaking pattern is\nSU(Nf )L \u00d7 SU(Nf )R \u00d7U(1)B \u2192 SU(Nf )V , (2.30)\nwhere in particular baryon number is broken at the minimum in this case. This vacuum is not smoothly connected to the one of non-SUSY QCD, since the Vafa-Witten theorem [35], which is only valid in the decoupling limit (i.e. m \u2192 \u221e), tells that baryon number is not spontaneously broken in the later case. In order to know which chiral symmetry breaking pattern is preferred, we need to compare the depth of two different minima. Strictly speaking, the potential in eq. (2.29) is not bounded from below: there is a runaway direction along\n|\u03b1| = m Nf \u2212 2 Nf 1 |\u03bb1| \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u039b M\u0302 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Nf\u22122 , (2.31)\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 1 6\nwhere the inequality \u2223\u2223\u2223\u039b2 \u2212 \u03bb1 M\u0302Nf\u039bNf\u22122 \u2223\u2223\u2223 > |\u03bb2||\u03b1|2 can be satisfied, since the left-handed side is of order \u039b2 without fine-tuning, while the right-handed side is of order m2, and scale m is assumed to be infinitesimal compared to \u039b. Nevertheless, due to our limitation of the full knowledge on K\u00e4hler potential when M\u0302 & \u039b, the above potential is not trustable when M\u0302 is large compared to \u039b. We expect that non-holomorphic higher dimensional operators in the K\u00e4hler potential kick in roughly at the scale of order \u039b, which might stabilize the potential; otherwise V \u2192 \u2212\u221e as |M\u0302 | \u2192 \u221e following the runaway direction. To be specific, the potential along this runaway direction is\nV = m2 ( Nf \u2212 2 Nf )2 2|\u03bb2| |\u03bb1|2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u039b M\u0302 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232Nf\u22124 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u039b2 \u2212 \u03bb1 M\u0302Nf\u039bNf\u22122 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2212m2 (Nf \u2212 2)2Nf |M\u0302 |2 \u22124m2Nf \u2212 2\nNf \u039b2 |\u03bb1| \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u039b M\u0302 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Nf\u22122 +O(m4) . (2.32) Here we can only estimate the depth of potential along the runaway direction, and the field value needs to be restricted as |M\u0302 | . \u039b. As an illustrative benchmark, we find the potential value is approximately\nV ' \u2212m 2\u039b2 4\u03c0 N2f \u2212 4 Nf +O(m4) at |M\u0302 | ' \u039b\u221a 4\u03c0 +O(m2) , (2.33)\nwhere NDA values \u03bb1 ' (4\u03c0)Nc/2 and \u03bb2 ' 4\u03c0 are used [38, 39]. We also verify numerically the full potential along runaway direction is almost as deep as \u2212Nfm\n2\u039b2 4\u03c0 at |M\u0302 | \u223c \u039b for\nNf = 3, while it can be much deeper at |M\u0302 | \u223c \u039b for Nf = 4, 5, 6. For large Nf (where Nf = Nc), the full potential along runaway direction is approximately \u2212m2 (Nf\u22122) 2\nNf |M\u0302 |2,\nwhich is the only term not suppressed by (4\u03c0)\u2212Nc . We find it is deeper than \u2212Nfm 2\u039b2\n4\u03c0 for |M\u0302 | & \u039b/ \u221a 4\u03c0 ' \u039b/3, which is not far from the origin and the regular K\u00e4hler potential (which may not be canonical) in B, B\u0303 and M can be trustable. Notice that the point here is not to determine the depth of the minimum precisely, since we do not have good theoretical control on the K\u00e4hler potential when the field values are comparable to the dynamical scale. Rather, our result can be interpreted as follows: if only the regular K\u00e4hler potential is used, our analysis suggests a baryon-number breaking direction along which the potential is not bounded from below. One might be tempted to improve the above calculation by taking a toy interpolating K\u00e4hler potential that interpolates between the region close to the origin (B, B\u0303,M \u039b), where K \u223c M \u2020M is valid, and the region far away from the origin (B, B\u0303,M \u039b), where K \u223c Q\u2020Q \u223c \u221a M \u2020M is valid. If one is more interested in the region where the field value is comparable to the dynamical scale \u039b, the result crucially depends on the details of the assumed interpolating K\u00e4hler potential. There can be different interpolating K\u00e4hler potentials which can reproduce the same limits when very close to or very far away from the origin, but they can be very different when the field value is of order the dynamical scale \u039b. Using any specific form of the interpolating K\u00e4hler potential would just be another assumption introduced in the calculation. Compared to ref. [22], our novelty is to analyze the SUSY moduli space and its deformation with AMSB in full generality. In particular, a dangerous runaway direction with\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 1 6\nspontaneously-broken baryon number is identified, which becomes extremely problematic for large Nc where Nc = Nf . Our analysis shows AMSB has only limited power for deriving the chiral symmetry breaking pattern of non-SUSY QCD: the runaway direction of spontaneously-broken baryon number is not smoothly connected to non-SUSY QCD, in general phase transitions are expected as the SUSY-breaking scale m is extrapolated from zero to infinity; otherwise non-holomorphic new physics needs to kick in below the scale \u039b to stabilize this runaway direction.\n2.2.2 rank(M) < Nf When rank(M) < Nf (i.e. detM = 0), the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking is different from 2.12. More specifically, in the diagonal basis of the meson superfield, Mij = diag(M1,M2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,MNf\u22121, 0) where at most Nf \u2212 1 eigenvalues are non-vanishing. The SUSY potential and AMSB potential are respectively\nVSUSY = |\u03bb2|2 ( |x|2 + 1 |x|2 ) |\u03b1|2|b|2 + \u2223\u2223\u2223\u03bb2b2 \u2212 \u039b2\u2223\u2223\u22232 + |\u03bb1| 2\n\u039b2Nf\u22124 |\u03b1|2 \u2223\u2223\u2223M1M2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7MNf\u22121\u2223\u2223\u22232 , (2.34) VAMSB = 2m\u039b2\u03b1+ h.c. = 4m\u039b2|\u03b1| cos \u03b8\u03b1 , (2.35)\nwhere, for any fixed but non-vanishing values of |\u03b1| and |b|, the full potential V = VSUSY + VAMSB is minimized at |x| = 1, cos \u03b8\u03b1 = \u22121, and M1M2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7MNf\u22121 = 0 (i.e. rank(M) < Nc \u2212 1). When rank(M) < Nc \u2212 1, there are nontrivial \u2019t Hooft anomaly constraints, as we will discuss later. Moreover, \u2202|\u03b1|V = 0 implies\n|\u03b1| = m\u039b 2\n|\u03bb2|2|b|2 , (2.36)\nalong which the full potential becomes\nV = \u22122 m 2\u039b4 |\u03bb2|2|b|2 + \u2223\u2223\u2223\u03bb2b2 \u2212 \u039b2\u2223\u2223\u22232 . (2.37)\nStrictly speaking, V is not bounded from below as |b| \u2192 0. When detM = 0 and |b| = 0, AMSB potential only depend on \u03b1, which is not stabilized as \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e no matter how infinitesimally small the SUSY breaking scale m is compared to the dynamical scale \u039b. To summarize so far, when rank(M) < Nf , minimizing the full potential together with AMSB prefers the sub-manifold rank(M) \u2264 Nf \u22122 and B = B\u0303 = 0, which is not connected to the SUSY moduli space characterized by detM \u2212BB\u0303 = \u039bNc . Within this sub-manifold the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking is\nSU(Nf )L \u00d7 SU(Nf )R \u00d7U(1)B \u2192 SU(N \u2032f )L \u00d7 SU(N \u2032f )R \u00d7U(1)B (2.38)\nwhere N \u2032f = Nf \u2212 rank(M). There are \u2019t Hooft anomalies of unbroken chiral symmetries that need to be matched: SU(N \u2032f )2L,RU(1)B and SU(N \u2032f )3L,R (when N \u2032f > 2). Nevertheless, the massless fermionic components of the superfields M,B, B\u0303 cannot match these\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 1 6\nanomalies, this suggests that other massless degrees of freedom should exist in this (runaway) vacuum.7 Note that this vacuum is problematic cosmologically, since the cosmological constant is large and negative in this vacuum, the entire Universe would crunch (see e.g. [40\u201342]). It is difficult to imagine QCD in the real world would live in this vacuum. Alternatively, one can consider the vacua which are smoothly connected to the SUSY moduli space, i.e. the vacua which differ from detM \u2212 BB\u0303 = \u039bNc where the difference is characterized by the SUSY-breaking scale m. In this case, \u2019t Hooft anomalies can always be matched with massless fermionic degrees of freedom of M,B, B\u0303. However, the minima to be found are local minima. When rank(M) < Nf , one can do perturbation on the baryon superfields as\n\u03bb2b 2 ' \u039b2 + \u03b4 +O(\u03b42), (2.39)\nwhere \u03b4 is order of m2. The potential in eq. (2.37) becomes\nV = \u22122m 2\u039b2 \u03bb2 + 2m 2 \u03bb2 \u03b4 + \u03b42 + O(\u03b42,m2\u03b4) , (2.40)\nwhere higher order perturbations, such as the ones of order \u03b42 or m2\u03b4, can be neglected. The condition \u2202\u03b4V = 0 implies\n\u03b4 ' \u2212m 2\n\u03bb2 (2.41)\nup to higher order peturbations. The potential is minimized with the minimum value being approximately\nVmin ' \u2212 2m2\u039b2 \u03bb2 ' \u2212m 2\u039b2 2\u03c0 , (2.42)\nwhere in the last step NDA value of \u03bb2 is used. This minimum is shallower than the minima with rank(M) = Nf , as identified in the previous subsection."

In particular, there is no chiral symmetry breaking at the origin, and the theory is Higgsed down in any generic point of the moduli space. In this section, we focus on SUSY QCD, other s-confining theories will be discussed in section 4.

Therefore, BNf and B\u0303Nf are not vanishing when rank(M) = Nf \u2212 1; either BNf or B\u0303Nf vanishes when rank(M) < Nf \u2212 1. Remarkably, the SUSY moduli space contains the origin M = B = B\u0303 = 0. \u2019t Hooft anomalies are matched everywhere on the moduli space, including the origin where chiral symmetry is unbroken. We assume that the K\u00e4hler potential is regular in meson and baryon chiral superfields, at least this is believed to be true close to the origin. When the K\u00e4hler potential is canonical, the superpotential is found to be\nW = \u03bb Nf\u2211 i,j=1 BiMijB\u0303j \u2212 \u03ba detM \u039bNf\u22123\n(2.47)\nwhere \u03bb and \u03ba are dimensionless but uncalculable coefficients if meson and baryon fields are not canonically normalized. From the superpotential in eq.

Minimizing the full potential with AMSB prefers rank(M) = Nf at the minimum; otherwise AMSB potential vanishes and the minimal value of the full potential is zero, this cannot be the global minimum. In the following, we do not assume the minimum of the full potential is alongMij \u221d \u03b4ij , rather we show that this is not true for small enough m. Thus the symmetry breaking pattern of slightly broken SUSY QCD differs from the one of standard non-SUSY QCD, and the two theories are not smoothly connected."

It is expected that different chiral symmetry breaking patterns can be found within this sub-manifold.

Once SUSY breaking is turned off, the original moduli space is recovered. The field values of other entries are kept in generic, however they are restricted to be smaller than dynamical scale \u039b. Due to the limitation of our knowledge of K\u00e4hler potential, we cannot predict precisely when the field values are bigger (but not infinitely bigger) than \u039b.

When i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Nf \u2212 1, it is useful to choose the parametrization\nMi = yiM\u0302, Nf\u22121\u220f i=1 yi = 1 , (2.64)\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 1 6\nand the full potential is\nV = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03ba\u039bNf\u22123 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 |\u03b4MNf |2|M\u0302 |2Nf\u22124 Nf\u22121\u2211 i=1 1 |yi|2 + 2 |\u03bb||\u03ba| \u039bNf\u22123 |\u03b4MNf | 2|M\u0302 |Nf\u22121\n\u2212 2 m(Nf \u2212 3) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03ba\u039bNf\u22123 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 |\u03b4MNf ||M\u0302 |Nf\u22121 cos(Nf\u03b8M ) +O(m4) . (2.65) The full potential gets minimized at cos(Nf\u03b8M ) and |yi| = 1.\nAlong the direction in the field space suggested by \u2202|\u03b4MNf |V = 0, we obtain\n|\u03b4MNf | = m (Nf \u2212 3)\n(Nf \u2212 1)|M\u0302 |Nf\u22123 |\u03ba|\u039bNf\u22123 + 2|\u03bb| +O(m3) , (2.66)\nand the full potential along this direction is\nV = \u2212m2 |\u03ba| \u039bNf\u22123 (Nf \u2212 3)2 |M\u0302 |Nf +2 |\u03ba|\n\u039bNf\u22123 (Nf \u2212 1)|M\u0302 |Nf + 2|\u03bb||M\u0302 |3\n+O(m4) . (2.67)\nStrictly speaking, the above potential is not bounded from below: when |M\u0302 | is far from the origin, the potential scales as V \u223c \u2212m2|M\u0302 |2, it runs away as |M | \u2192 \u221e. However, as we mentioned before, this potential is only trustable quantitatively near the origin, i.e. when \u039b & |M |. If the field value of |M\u0302 | \u223c m0 \u039b, this runaway vacuum can still be deeper the vacuum in eq. (2.55): when |M\u0302 | \u039b, the above potential is approximately\nV ' \u2212m2 |\u03ba| \u039bNf\u22123 (Nf \u2212 3)2 2|\u03bb| |M\u0302 | Nf\u22121 +O(m4) , (2.68)\nwhich is deeper because its dependence on the SUSY-breaking scale m has lower power than eq. (2.55). For example, for the QCD-like theory with Nf = 4 and Nc = 3, V is of order \u2212m2|M\u0302 |3/\u039b along the direction of broken baryon number, while it is of order \u2212m3\u039b along the direction of conserving baryon number. The vacua with broken baryon number is deeper when |M\u0302 | & (m\u039b2)1/3, which is still close to the origin, given the fact that the SUSY-breaking scale m is infinitesimal compared to the dynamical scale \u039b. Along this runaway direction of broken baryon number, the chiral symmetry breaking pattern is\nSU(Nf )L \u00d7 SU(Nf )R \u00d7U(1)B \u2192 SU(Nf \u2212 1)V . (2.69)\nThis implies that phase transitions are mandatory between the SUSY QCD with a small enough m and the standard non-SUSY QCD (with m \u2192 \u221e). In the m \u2192 \u221e limit, the Vafa-Witten theorem [35] holds and ensures that U(1)B is unbroken."

Assuming \u03c6i have the canonical K\u00e4hler potential, we are going to show that the \u201cjump\u201d of VAMSB when integrating out the Nf -th flavor exactly matches the contribution from the holomorphic mass term.\nClearly there are other ways to integrate out part of the theory, e.g. by going out in the moduli space and higgsing the theory with Nc colors and Nf flavors down to the theory with Nc\u22121 colors andNf\u22121 flavors. In this case, the heavy threshold is set by the vacuum expectation value of the last flavor of squark field, and it is known that \u201cultraviolet insensitivity\u201d does not hold in this case [31\u201333]. Below the threshold of scalar vacuum expectation value, the low energy effective theory is deflected away from the AMSB trajectory, therefore it is denoted as \u201cdeflected AMSB\u201d [31, 32]. As an illustrating example, let us consider Nf < Nc, where the low energy dynamical superpotential for theory of Nc colors and Nf flavors is\nWNc,Nf = (Nc \u2212Nf ) ( \u039b3Nc\u2212NfUV detM ) 1 Nc\u2212Nf , (3.1)\nfrom which one can compute the AMSB potential following eq.

            "heading": "4 On chiral symmetry breaking in s-confining theories",
            "text": "Confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are two distinct phenomena, and it is found that confinement without chiral symmetry breaking (namely s-confinement) can happen in SUSY gauge theories. As we discussed previously, SUSY QCD with Nf = Nc + 1 is the prototype example. Nevertheless, s-confinement seems quite unusual in the non-SUSY limit: the composite fermions in the non-SUSY limit are typically insufficient to match the \u2019t Hooft anomalies of the unbroken chiral symmetries. Therefore, the origin of the moduli space of s-confining SUSY gauge theories cannot persist as a minimum in the non-SUSY limit. In this section, we question whether this is generally true under the perturbation of AMSB.\nS-confinement in the SUSY limit. Based on global symmetries, holomorphy, and the definition of s-confinement (i.e. the exact same classical moduli space is reproduced in the confining phase), two important necessary conditions for candidate SUSY s-confining theories are identified [11, 12], when the theory has only one gauge group and no tree-level superpotential, then they classify all the SU(Nc), Sp(Nc), SO(Nc) s-confining theories with appropriate matters. From all the examples in refs. [11, 12], we find the low energy superpotential in the confined description consists of only operators whose power in composite fields is bigger or equal than three. For example, in SUSY QCD with Nf = Nc + 1, the operator BMB\u0303 has power being three, while the operator detM has power being Nf . For concreteness, the operators of power three are called as marginal operators, while the others are called as irrelevant operators, because they would respectively give rise to operators of being dimension four or larger in the potential. There are simple but general arguments to exclude operators whose power is less than three:8\n8These arguments are new. To the best of our knowledge, they did not appear in previous literature.\n\u2013 20 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 1 6\n1. Constant terms or fractional powers are forbidden, since they are not consistent with symmetries and holomorphy. More specifically, the index constraint [11, 12] implies the superpotential of being in the form\nW \u221d \u039b3 \u220f i ( \u03c6i \u039b )2\u00b5i , (4.1)\nwhere \u03c6i are the elementary superfields at the quark level with \u00b5i being their Dynkin indices. At low energy, \u03c6i form into composite fields Xi in the confined description. The superpotential W is still a polynomial function of Xi with powers being positive integers, which does not contain constant terms. Operators in fractional powers of Xi are impossible, since the origin is singular in that case.\n2. Linear terms of composite fields Xi are also forbidden, because they generate constant terms in equation of motion of Xi, whose solutions do not include the origin of the moduli space, such that the classical moduli space cannot be reproduced by low energy superpotential. Specifically, if W \u2283 ciXi where ci are nonzero coefficients of linear terms of various Xi, whose equations of motion are\n0 = \u2202W \u2202Xi = ci + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (4.2)\nwhere all the other terms vanish in the limit when all Xi = 0. Therefore, the origin of moduli space cannot solve those equations of motion. By the definition of sconfinement, those linear terms are not consistent.\n3. No quadratic terms of composite fields Xi and Xj are possible. They generate mass terms for the composite fields, which however is not consistent with \u2019t Hooft anomaly matching at the origin. For example, if W \u2283 cijXiXj where cij are dimensionful parameters of quadratic terms of Xi and Xj , the potential is\nVSUSY = \u2211 i \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202W\u2202Xi \u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 = \u2211 i |cijXj |2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (4.3)\nNevertheless, according to the definition of s-confinement, at the origin of moduli space, composite fields Xi are required to be massless and saturate \u2019t Hooft anomalies of unbroken chiral symmetries.\nWe conclude that only marginal and irrelevant operators are possible in the low energy superpotential of s-confining theories, and this implies VSUSY has operators being polynomials of composite fields Xi whose power can only be integers equal to or larger than four.\nUnder perturbation of AMSB. Among all the s-confining theories in refs. [11, 12], very few of them only have marginal operators in the low energy superpotential, where treelevel AMSB vanishes and the leading AMSB effect is at loop level. For example, it is found in ref. [30] that the theory of SU(5) gauge group with three generations of quarks in antifundamental and anti-symmetric representations in the non-SUSY limit is likely to confine\n\u2013 21 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 1 6\nwith chiral symmetry breaking due to the difficulty of \u2019t Hooft anomaly matching, whereas its SUSY version is s-confining and the origin persists as a minimum with loop-level AMSB. This implies phase transitions when the SUSY-breaking scale is extrapolated to large values.\nIn this work, we instead focus on the theories whose low energy superpotential consists of irrelevant operators. Most of the candidate s-confining theories belong to this class, and the leading AMSB effect is at tree-level. More specifically, irrelevant operators lead to tree-level AMSB potential\nVAMSB = m ( Xi \u2202W\n\u2202Xi \u2212 3W\n) + h.c. , (4.4)\nand, near the origin of moduli space, there always exists a direction along which VAMSB is decreasing, since AMSB potential is not semi positive-definite and the composite fields are in general complex. Concretely, this decreasing direction can be defined as follows: one can always choose one irrelevant operator, dubbed as O\u0303, in the low energy superpotential and only the composite fields in this operator, dubbed as {X\u0303i}, have non-vanishing vacuum expectation values with appropriate alignment and phases, other composite fields are required to have vanishing vacuum expectation values. Since X\u0303i are charged under the global symmetries (they are in chiral representations and their fermionic components are needed for saturating the \u2019t Hooft anomalies), the chosen operator is the only operator consisting of all the composite fields in {X\u0303i}, such that the vacuum expectation value of the entire operator is non-vanishing, and it is still consistent with holomorphy; in contrast, the operator having different powers of X\u0303i is not consistent. For example, in SUSY QCD with Nf = Nc + 1, detM is the only operator consisting of the composite field M and it is consistent with holomorphy; operators such as (detM)2, (detM)3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 are not allowed.\nThe above statement can be made more quantitatively. Since our goal is to show the existence of the decreasing direction near the origin, rather than to pin down the global symmetry breaking pattern, let us assume all the composite fields in the chosen operator have common but nonzero vacuum expectation value \u03be for simplicity. Up to dimensionless coefficients, the potential V has the schematic form:\nV = VAMSB + VSUSY \u223c \u2212m \u03bed1 \u039bd1\u22123 + \u03bed2 \u039bd2\u22124 , (4.5)\nwhere d1 is the dimensionality of the chosen irrelevant operator in the superpotential (i.e. d1 \u2265 4) if the dimensionality of each composite operator is one, accordingly d2 is the dimensionality of VSUSY . Minimizing the potential, i.e. \u2202\u03beV = 0, yields\n\u03be \u223c ( d1 d2 m\u039bd2\u2212d1\u22121 ) 1 d2\u2212d1 \u039b when m \u039b , (4.6)\nat which the potential has the value\nV \u223c (d1 d2 ) d2 d2\u2212d1 \u2212 ( d1 d2 ) d1 d2\u2212d1 m d2d2\u2212d1 \u039b 4d1\u22123d2d1\u2212d2 . (4.7)\n\u2013 22 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 1 6\nFor s-confining theories, d2 = 2d1 \u2212 2 (i.e. d2 > d1 for d1 \u2265 4) if VAMSB and VSUSY are generated by the same operator. Therefore,\nV < 0 with d1 < d2 , (4.8)\ni.e. the potential is decreasing near the origin along the chosen direction. It is still possible that VAMSB and VSUSY are induced by different operators, e.g. VAMSB is induced by the chosen operator O\u0303, while VSUSY is induced by a different operator which contains a subset of fields in {X\u0303i} but is linear in other fields. In this case, one needs to determine d1 and d2 more carefully. We checked in many examples in refs. [11, 12] and we find that the operator O\u0303 always exist such that d1 < d2, i.e. V < 0 along the direction specified by O\u0303. We will clarify this point in a separate publication with concrete examples. In other words, the origin of the moduli space does not persist as a minimum under the perturbation of AMSB. This is consistent to what we find in section 2.3 for SUSY QCD with Nf = Nc+1. However, the minimum near the origin may not be the global minimum."

            "heading": "5 Concluding remarks",
            "text": "In this work, we critically examined the results obtained in ref. [22] mainly focusing on SUSY QCD with Nf \u2264 Nc+1. Our novelty is to analyze the general moduli space without assuming Mij \u221d \u03b4ij , where M is the meson chiral superfield and i, j are the flavor indices. For 3Nc > Nf > Nc + 1, the low energy SUSY QCD is described by the dual magnetic theory, we will present the similar analysis in a separate work.\nOur main results in this work can be summarized as follows:\n1. We find the chiral symmetry breaking pattern of SUSY QCD perturbed by AMSB is the same as that of non-SUSY QCD only for Nf < Nc. However, runaway directions exist for Nf = Nc and Nf = Nc + 1, along which baryon number is spontaneously broken. Therefore, in order to be consistent with the Vafa-Witten theorem (i.e. persistent mass condition) in the non-SUSY limit, phase transitions are necessary when the SUSY-breaking scale is extrapolated to large values.9 Note that spontaneously broken baryon number signals the violation of persistent mass condition, i.e. the Nambu-Goldstone boson of U(1)B remains exactly massless even its microscopic constituent quarks are (infinitely) massive.\n2. We perform explicit consistency checks for the compelling feature of AMSB called \u201cultraviolet insensitivity\u201d, by adding the holomorphic mass term for the Nf -th flavor and integrating it out below the mass threshold. We verify that the \u201cjump\u201d of AMSB potentials for the Nf -flavor theory and the (Nf \u2212 1)-flavor theory matches the contribution from the holomorphic mass term.\n9In the standard non-SUSY QCD, the chiral symmetry breaking pattern is determined by the quark condensate. However, in the SUSY QCD, the squark component in the chiral superfield also plays a role in strong dynamics and is relevant in the infrared. It might be hard to believe that the change of degrees of freedom in the strong dynamics is continuous between these two limits. More naturally, there may be phase transitions. Indeed, our results point to this direction.\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 1 6\n3. Based on the general features of s-confinement, if tree-level AMSB is not vanishing, we find that the origin of the moduli space of the SUSY theory cannot persist as a minimum under the perturbation of AMSB. Nevertheless, we note this is not enough to pin down the specific global symmetry breaking pattern. A systematic study for determining the global symmetry breaking patterns for these s-confining theories is required.\nDeriving the chiral symmetry breaking pattern in non-SUSY confining gauge theories is still an open question, it is fascinating to notice the perturbation of AMSB is exact and there is still enough predictive power despite the fact the theory confines in the infrared. Nevertheless, it is important to clarify what conditions are still needed as inputs to derive the \u201ccorrect\u201d chiral symmetry breaking pattern in the non-SUSY limit. For QCD-like theories of Nf = Nc and Nf = Nc + 1, we find that baryon number conservation is needed as an input, rather than obtained as an output. Phenomenologically, if SUSY is part of reality of the QCD sector (rather than just being a theoretical tool for controlling the strong dynamics), we might be able to understand why SUSY is so badly broken following the cosmological crunching idea [40\u201342]. One can imagine there is a \u201cmultiverse\u201d (i.e. a landscape of vacua) where the SUSY-breaking scale is different in each of the patches, the patches with small SUSY-breaking scale cannot live long enough cosmologically due to the existence of the runaway direction, along which baryon number is also broken. We hope to return to this direction in the future. Overall, we hope that our results can be useful for better understanding the vacua of non-SUSY confining gauge theories, especially QCD."

            "text": "In this section we review anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) in the context of SUSY QCD. The SUSY-breaking can be introduced using the Weyl compensator\n\u03a6 = 1 +m \u03b82 , (A.1)\nwhere the SUSY Lagrangian is modified accordingly as L = \u222b d4\u03b8 \u03a6\u2217\u03a6 K + \u222b d2\u03b8 \u03a63 W + c.c. , (A.2)\n\u2013 24 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 1 6\nwherem is the SUSY-breaking scale, K andW are the K\u00e4hler potential and superpotential, respectively. Since the Weyl compensator \u03a6 can be thought of as the background of a supergravity multiplet, it couples to SUSY QCD universally regardless of whether the theory confines or not. In AMSB, SUSY-breaking is only physical when there is no exact superconformal invariance, i.e. \u03a6 cannot be removed by certain field redefinitions.\nA.1 High energy theory\nThe SUSY QCD Lagrangian together with the Weyl compensator is L = \u222b d4\u03b8(\u03a6\u2217\u03a6) ( Q\u2020eR(V )fQ+ Q\u0303\u2020eR(V )f\u0304 Q\u0303 ) + 116\u03c0i \u222b d2\u03b8\u03a63 \u03c4 tr[W aW a] + c.c. . (A.3)\nNote that \u222b d2\u03b8 tr[W aW a] \u223c \u2212tr[F 2 + iF F\u0303 ] with F\u0303 a\u00b5\u03bd = 12 \u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3F a\u03c1\u03c3, so\n\u03c4(\u00b5) = \u03b82\u03c0 + 4\u03c0i g2(\u00b5) = b0 2\u03c0i log \u039b \u00b5 , i.e. \u039b = \u00b5 e2\u03c0i\u03c4(\u00b5)/b0 , (A.4)\nwhere b0 = 3Nc \u2212 Nf , \u00b5 and \u039b are the renormalization scale and the dynamical scale, respectively. In order to understand the physical consequence of the Weyl compensator \u03a6, it is useful to rescale all the fields to try to reabsorb the dependence on \u03a6. If \u03a6 can completely be removed, SUSY is not broken. At tree-level, \u03a6 is removed by the rescaling\nQ\u2192 Q\u2032 = \u03a6Q , Q\u0303\u2192 Q\u0303\u2032 = \u03a6Q\u0303 , W a \u2192W a\u2032 = \u03a63/2W a , (A.5)\ni.e. SUSY QCD is classically conformal. However, conformal invariance can be broken at loop level (i.e. super-Weyl transformation can be anomalous), where SUSY is also broken. To be specific, we find at loop level\n\u03c4(\u00b5)\u2192 \u03c4 ( \u00b5\n\u03a6 ) = \u03c4(\u00b5) + b02\u03c0i log(\u03a6) , (A.6)\nwhich can be justified using spurion analysis [23], as we will review in the following. In order to derive eq. (A.6), let us also rescale the dynamical scale \u039b in accordance with the rescaling of various fields as\nQ\u2032 = \u03a6Q , Q\u0303\u2032 = \u03a6Q\u0303 , W a\u2032 = \u03a63/2W a , and \u039b\u2032 = \u03a6\u03b1\u039b , (A.7)\nwhere the value of \u03b1 is kept as agnostic for the moment. Let us also introduce an U(1)R\u2032 symmetry which only acts nontrivially on the compensator field \u03a6. All the relevant U(1) symmetries in the theory and the charges are summarized in table (1a) before rescaling and in table (1b) after rescaling, where U(1)B,A,R are the usual global U(1)\u2019s of SUSY QCD Lagrangian. Note that U(1)B and U(1)R are anomaly-free but U(1)A is anomalous, i.e. only the U(1)A transformation would shift \u03b8. Because U(1)B,A,R are all the global symmetries in the theory, U(1)R\u2032 must be a linear combination of them. Furthermore, since Q and Q\u0303 are charged differently under U(1)B, it cannot be part of the linear combination, i.e. U(1)R\u2032 is only a linear combination of U(1)A and U(1)R, where the corresponding charges are given by\nqR\u2032 = a \u00b7 qA + b \u00b7 qR, (A.8)\n\u2013 25 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 1 6\nQ Q\u0303 W a \u039b \u03a6 U(1)B 1 -1 0 0 0 U(1)A 1 1 0 2Nf3Nc\u2212Nf 0 U(1)R Nf\u2212NcNf Nf\u2212Nc Nf\n1 0 0 U(1)R\u2032 0 0 0 0 23\n(a) Various U(1) charges of the fields in high-energy SUSY QCD before rescaling (A.7), where only \u03a6 is charged under U(1)R\u2032 .\nQ\u2032 Q\u0303\u2032 W a\u2032 \u039b\u2032\nU(1)B 1 -1 0 0 U(1)A 1 1 0 2Nf3Nc\u2212Nf U(1)R Nf\u2212NcNf Nf\u2212Nc Nf\n1 0 U(1)R\u2032 23 2 3 1 2 3\u03b1\n(b) Various U(1) charges of the fields in the highenergy SUSY QCD after the rescaling (A.7). The U(1)R\u2032 symmetry after the rescaling is a linear combination of U(1)A, U(1)R and the original U(1)R\u2032 .\nwith a and b being the coefficients.10 By matching the U(1)R\u2032 charges of Q\u2032, Q\u0303\u2032 and W a\u2032, the values of a and b can be solved:\na = 3Nc \u2212Nf3Nf , b = 1 . (A.9)\nFurthermore, the value of \u03b1 is also determined using the fact 2 3\u03b1 = 3Nc \u2212Nf 3Nf \u00b7 2Nf3Nc \u2212Nf , i.e. \u03b1 = 1. (A.10)\nThis result can be understood as follows: if \u03b1 takes any other value different from 1, the U(1)R\u2032 symmetry would be anomalous, i.e. \u03b8 is shifted under U(1)R\u2032 transformation for the fields Q\u2032, Q\u0303\u2032 andW a\u2032, which however can be compensated if \u039b is also redefined accordingly. In order to formally restore the U(1)R\u2032 symmetry also at quantum level (which is similar to U(1)A symmetry), one needs to rescale the dynamical scale as \u039b\u2032 = \u03a6\u039b. In other words, the SUSY QCD Lagrangian in terms of the rescaled fields remains in the same form as the one before rescaling, but \u03c4(\u00b5) is replaced with \u03c4(\u00b5/\u03a6) as in eq. (A.6). Since the dependence of \u03a6 cannot be removed at loop level, SUSY is broken. Fixing the background value for \u03a6 as in eq. (A.1) and integrating over the superspace, one obtains the gluino mass as\nmgluino = g2\n16\u03c02 b0m . (A.11)\n10Notice here qR\u2032,A,R are the U(1) charges, one should not get confused with chiral superfields which are denoted as Q, Q\u0303.\n\u2013 26 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 1 6\nThe origin of the mass terms for squarks is analogous. Renormalization generates the wave function Z(\u00b5) of quark superfields Q, after rescaling which is\nL \u2283 \u222b d4\u03b8 Z ( \u00b5\n|\u03a6|\n) Q \u2032\u2020eR(V )fQ\u2032 . (A.12)\nIn order to formally restore U(1)R\u2032 symmetry and the K\u00e4hler potential is required to be charge-neutral, the dependence on \u03a6 must be |\u03a6| \u2261 (\u03a6\u2217\u03a6)1/2. By Taylor expanding the wave function and integrating over the superspace in the K\u00e4hler potential, one obtains the squark mass:\nm2squarks = \u2212 1 4 \u03b3\u0307m 2 , where \u03b3 = \u00b5 d d\u00b5 Z(\u00b5) \u03b3\u0307 = \u00b5 d d\u00b5 \u03b3. (A.13)\nA.2 Low energy theory\nThe low energy limit of SUSY QCD is exactly known since the pioneering work of Seiberg [1, 2]. For the purpose of the present work, we only review the cases of Nf \u2264 Nc + 1. In all of these cases, SUSY is broken at tree-level via AMSB, where not all the operators in the superpotentialW are of dimension three. In practice, one can calculate the AMSB-induced potential (or AMSB potential) using\nVAMSB = m ( \u03c6i \u2202W\n\u2202\u03c6i \u2212 3W\n) + h.c. . (A.14)\nThe tree-level AMSB potential vanishes if all the operators in the superpotential W are of dimension three, as in SUSY QCD at high energy. As we will justify, this formula can be derived by using the spurion analysis, i.e. rescaling various chiral superfields with the Weyl compensator. If certain fields \u03c6i are not canonically normalized, additional factors appear when VAMSB is expressed in the canonically-normalized fields. In the following, we will review case by case for different Nf while Nc is fixed.\nA.2.1 Nf < Nc Here the low energy physics is described in terms of the meson chiral superfield M \u223c QQ\u0303, whose charges under various U(1) symmetries can be read off straightforwardly by adding the charges of Q and Q\u0303. The classical moduli space in the ultraviolet is uplifted by the dynamical ADS superpotential\nW = (Nc \u2212Nf ) (\n\u039b3Nc\u2212Nf detM\n) 1 Nc\u2212Nf\n, (A.15)\nwhile the K\u00e4hler potential near the origin is given by\nK = a |\u039b|2M \u2020M + . . . , (A.16)\nwhere high dimensional operators are neglected, and there might be undetermined coefficient a ifM is not canonically normalized. Note that K\u00e4hler potential is out of holomorphic\n\u2013 27 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 1 6\ncontrol, its exact form is unknown. When the field values of M and M \u2020 are large, high dimensional operators cannot be neglected.\nFollowing the previous spurion analysis, we need to formally restore the U(1)R\u2032 symmetry, and this can be done by the rescaling\nM \u2192M \u2032 = \u03a62M and \u039b\u2192 \u039b\u2032 = \u03a6\u039b . (A.17)\nThe Lagrangian in terms of the rescaled fields is given by\nL = \u222b d4\u03b8 ( a\n|\u039b\u2032|2M \u2032\u2020M \u2032 + . . .\n) + \u222b d2\u03b8(Nc \u2212Nf ) ( \u039b\u20323Nc\u2212Nf detM \u2032 ) 1 Nc\u2212Nf + h.c. , (A.18)\nwhere we see explicitly that the Lagrangian becomes formally independent on the Weyl compensator \u03a6.11 One can do a second field redefinition as\nMc \u2261 \u221a aM \u2032\n\u039b\u2032 = \u221a a \u03a6 M\u039b , (A.19)\nwhich renders the K\u00e4hler potential be canonical, and the superpotential in Mc becomes\nW = (Nc \u2212Nf ) \u039b\u20323Nc\u22122Nf aNf2 detMc  1 Nc\u2212Nf\n= (Nc \u2212Nf ) \u03a6 3Nc\u22122Nf Nc\u2212Nf a Nf 2Nc\u22122Nf ( \u039b3Nc\u22122Nf detMc ) 1 Nc\u2212Nf . (A.20)\nUsing Tayler expansion for the background of Weyl compensator\n\u03a6 3Nc\u22122Nf Nc\u2212Nf = 1 + 3Nc \u2212 2Nf Nc \u2212Nf \u03b82 m (A.21)\nand integrating over the superspace, the AMSB potential is obtained as\n\u2212L \u2283 VAMSB = \u2212(3Nc \u2212 2Nf ) m a Nf 2Nc\u22122Nf ( \u039b3Nc\u22122Nf detMc ) 1 Nc\u2212Nf + h.c. (A.22)\n= \u2212(3Nc \u2212 2Nf ) m (\n\u039b3Nc\u22122Nf detMc\n) 1 Nc\u2212Nf\n+ h.c. when a = 1. (A.23)\nThe same result is reached by directly applying eq. (A.14) to the ADS superpotential, where Mc corresponds to M/\u039b. Notice that Mc has mass dimension one, but the original M has mass dimension two.\n11However, the dependence on \u03a6 is hidden in \u039b\u2032, which can be found back at the end of calculation using \u039b\u2032 = \u03a6\u039b. In the spurion analysis, \u039b is promoted as a chiral superfield, such that it should rescale properly according to the anomalous U(1)R\u2032 symmetry. The physical dynamical scale is still \u039b, rather than \u039b\u2032.\n\u2013 28 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 1 6\nA.2.2 Nf = Nc and Nf = Nc + 1\nIn these two cases, the low energy limit is described by both baryon and meson chiral superfields, which are B \u223c QNc , B\u0303 \u223c Q\u0303Nc and M \u223c QQ\u0303, respectively. Again, their U(1) charges can be read off directly from their microscopic constituents. The superpotentials are under holomorphic control, and the their forms (with the Weyl compensator \u03a6) are exactly known:\nW(Nf =Nc) = \u03a6 3 \u03b1 \u039b2Nc\u22122 ( detM \u2212 B\u0303B \u2212 \u039b2Nc ) (A.24)\nfor Nf = Nc, and\nW(Nf =Nc+1) = \u03a6 3 1 \u039b2Nc\u22121 ( BMB\u0303 \u2212 detM ) (A.25)\nfor Nf = Nc + 1. The K\u00e4hler potential however is out of holomorphic control, near the origin it can be expanded in polynomials of baryon and meson chiral superfields, where high dimensional operators can be neglected. To be specific, the K\u00e4hler potential is\nK = (\u03a6\u2020\u03a6) { a\n|\u039b|2M \u2020M + b |\u039b|2Nc\u22122 ( B\u2020B + B\u0303\u2020B\u0303 ) + ( \u03b1\u2020\u03b1 )} + . . . , (A.26)\nwhere the Weyl compensator \u03a6 is explicitly given, a, b, \u03bb are undetermined coefficients if these chiral superfields are not canonically normalized. Here \u03b1 is also treated as a dynamical field, which is formally introduced as the Lagrange multiplier in the case of Nf = Nc; on the other hand, \u03b1 can be set to zero when Nf = Nc + 1.\nThe U(1)R\u2032 symmetry is formally restored by the following field rescalings:\nM \u2032 = \u03a62M , B\u2032 = \u03a6NcB , B\u0303\u2032 = \u03a6NcB\u0303 , \u039b\u2032 = \u03a6\u039b and \u03b1\u2032 = \u03a6\u03b1 , (A.27)\nThe Lagrangian in terms of these rescaled fields is formally independent of \u03a6, as also seen previously in the case when Nf < Nc. Again, let us stress that the \u03a6 dependence is hidden in \u039b\u2032, i.e. \u03a6 cannot completely be removed at tree-level if there is any operator with dimensionful parameters. At the end of calculation, the \u03a6 dependence can be found back using \u039b\u2032 = \u03a6\u039b, where \u039b remains as the physical dynamical scale and final result should be expressed in \u039b. One can do a second rescaling to bring the K\u00e4hler potential into canonical form. The superpotentials in canonical fields for Nf = Nc and Nf = Nc+1 are respectively\nW(Nf =Nc) = \u03b1 ( \u03bb1 detM \u03a6Nf\u22122\u039bNf\u22122 \u2212 \u03bb2BB\u0303 \u2212 \u03a62\u039b2 )\n(A.28)\nand\nW(Nf =Nc+1) = \u03bb Nf\u2211 i,j=1 BiMijB\u0303j \u2212 \u03ba detM \u03a6Nf\u22123\u039bNf\u22123 . (A.29)\nThe AMSB potential is obtained by fixing the Weyl compensator \u03a6 to its background as in eq. (A.1), Tayler expanding the superpotential and integrating over the superspace. The final results match the general formula (A.14).\n\u2013 29 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 8 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 1 6"

            "text": "When Nf < Nc, since we find the ground state of the QCD-like theory is in the weakly coupled regime, it is natural to use quark/squark chiral superfields rather than meson fields. The K\u00e4hler potential is canonical in squarks far away from the origin. The dynamical ADS superpotential in quark/squark chiral superfields is\nW = (Nc \u2212Nf ) (\n\u039b3Nc\u2212Nf det(QQ\u0303)\n) 1 Nc\u2212Nf\n, (B.1)\nfrom which the SUSY potential and AMSB potential can be calculated straightforwardly. Again we work in the basis where Mij = QiQ\u0303j is diagonal, but we do not assume Qi = Q\u0303i. In other words, we do not assume Mij = \u03c62\u03b4ij where \u03c6 has canonical K\u00e4hler potential; rather, our goal is to derive this condition as an output of minimizing the potential.\nThe results of SUSY potential and AMSB potential are respectively\nVSUSY = \u039b 2 3Nc\u2212Nf Nc\u2212Nf \u00b7 Nf\u220f i=1 |QiQ\u0303i| \u2212 2 Nc\u2212Nf \u00b7 Nf\u2211 i=1 [ 1 |Qi|2 + 1 |Q\u0303i|2 ] , (B.2)\nand\nVAMSB = (Nf \u2212 3Nc) \u00b7m \u00b7 \u039b 3Nc\u2212Nf Nc\u2212Nf \u00b7 Nf\u220f i=1 QiQ\u0303i \u2212 1Nc\u2212Nf + h.c. . (B.3) For any fixed QiQ\u0303i,\n1 |Qi|2 + 1 |Q\u0303i|2 \u2265 2 |QiQ\u0303i| , (B.4)\nwhere the inequality is saturated when |Qi| = |Q\u0303i|. This justifies Mij = diag(\u03c621, \u03c622, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c62Nf ) in the diagonal basis. The rest of the analysis for minimizing VSUSY + VAMSB is the same as in section 2.1, and one obtains \u03c621 = \u03c622 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = \u03c62Nf , i.e. Mij = \u03c62\u03b4ij , at the minimum. This justifies the result obtained in section 2.1.\nOpen Access.
