    "abstractText": "As the world strives to control the HIV epidemic, attaining VL suppression for over 95% of people living with HIV on ART is a fundamental step in enabling Uganda, and other sub-Saharan African countries, to achieve the global targets of ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030, as stipulated in target 3.3 of the Sustainable Development Goal 3.1,2,3 HIV viral non-suppression is defined as HIV RNA viral copies equal to or greater than 1000 copies/mL as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).4 This is also an indication of HIV virologic treatment failure in Uganda, and several other sub-Saharan African countries like Kenya, Zambia and Sierra Leone, among others.5 Low-level viraemia (LLV) defined as having an HIV VL of at least 50 copies/mL but less than 1000 copies/mL (\u2265 50 copies/mL to < 1000 copies/mL) is considered as being virally suppressed. Despite the recent 2021 WHO recommendation to offer intensive adherence counselling (IAC) to people living with HIV on ART with LLV,6 no special intervention is given to people living with HIV with LLV in Uganda and several other sub-Saharan African countries; yet, LLV has been associated with various clinically poor outcomes like HIV drug resistance and virologic failure.7,8 This narrative review was completed in January 2022, and the reviewed articles were published from March 2000 to June 2021. Several databases including Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct were searched Attaining viral load (VL) suppression for over 95% of the people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy is a fundamental step in enabling Uganda and other sub-Saharan African countries to achieve global Sustainable Development Goal targets to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030. In line with the 2013 World Health Organization recommendations, several sub-Saharan African countries, including Uganda, use a threshold of 1000 HIV viral RNA copies/mL to determine HIV viral non-suppression. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care deem this threshold very high, and hence recommend using 200 copies/mL to determine viral nonsuppression. Using 1000 copies/mL as a threshold ignores people living with HIV who have low-level viraemia (LLV; HIV VL of at least 50 copies/mL but less than 1000 copies/mL). Despite the 2021 World Health Organization recommendations of using intensive adherence counselling for people living with HIV with LLV, several sub-Saharan African countries have no interventions to address LLV. However, recent studies have associated LLV with increased risks of HIV drug resistance, virologic failure and transmission. The purpose of this narrative review is to provide insights on the emerging concern of LLV among people living with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa. The review also provides guidance for Uganda and other sub-Saharan African countries to implement immediate appropriate interventions like intensive adherence counselling, reducing VL thresholds for nonsuppression and conducting more research to manage LLV which threatens progress towards ending HIV by 2030.",

Despite the recent 2021 WHO recommendation to offer intensive adherence counselling (IAC) to people living with HIV on ART with LLV,6 no special intervention is given to people living with HIV with LLV in Uganda and several other sub-Saharan African countries; yet, LLV has been associated with various clinically poor outcomes like HIV drug resistance and virologic failure.7,8 This narrative review was completed in January 2022, and the reviewed articles were published from March 2000 to June 2021. Several databases including Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct were searched\nAttaining viral load (VL) suppression for over 95% of the people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy is a fundamental step in enabling Uganda and other sub-Saharan African countries to achieve global Sustainable Development Goal targets to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030. In line with the 2013 World Health Organization recommendations, several sub-Saharan African countries, including Uganda, use a threshold of 1000 HIV viral RNA copies/mL to determine HIV viral non-suppression. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care deem this threshold very high, and hence recommend using 200 copies/mL to determine viral nonsuppression. Using 1000 copies/mL as a threshold ignores people living with HIV who have low-level viraemia (LLV; HIV VL of at least 50 copies/mL but less than 1000 copies/mL). Despite the 2021 World Health Organization recommendations of using intensive adherence counselling for people living with HIV with LLV, several sub-Saharan African countries have no interventions to address LLV. However, recent studies have associated LLV with increased risks of HIV drug resistance, virologic failure and transmission. The purpose of this narrative review is to provide insights on the emerging concern of LLV among people living with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa. The review also provides guidance for Uganda and other sub-Saharan African countries to implement immediate appropriate interventions like intensive adherence counselling, reducing VL thresholds for nonsuppression and conducting more research to manage LLV which threatens progress towards ending HIV by 2030.\nKeywords: HIV/AIDS; low-level viraemia; viral load testing; non-suppression; virologic failure.\nLow-level viraemia: An emerging concern among people living with HIV in Uganda and across\nsub-Saharan Africa\nHow to cite this article: Nanyeenya N, Kiwanuka N, Nakanjako D, et al.

In Uganda, an estimated 1.2 million (out of 1.4 million) people living with HIV were on ART by 2019.9 As the efforts to scale-up people living with HIV on ART continue, there is an inevitable need to monitor the efficacy of ART among people living with HIV10 and several methods of ART monitoring are recommended by WHO. These include patient monitoring involving clinical events and adherence monitoring, immunological monitoring involving CD4 cell count, and virologic monitoring comprising HIV VL testing.11, 12"

People living with HIV with a VL result below 1000 copies/mL have a suppressed VL and are routinely given adherence counselling in which they are encouraged to continue with ART, and no other intervention is given.5 A decreased VL is associated with better clinical outcomes and slowed disease progression,17 and is also associated with reduced HIV incidence at community level.17, 18 However, there is limited data about the cut-off of viral copies at which the slowed disease progression and reduced HIV incidence at community level happens.\nPeople living with HIV/AIDS who have been on ART for at least six months with a VL of 1000 copies/mL or more are non-suppressed. These people are offered monthly IAC\nsessions for three months. After the IAC sessions, a VL test is repeated in the fourth month to determine whether they have achieved VL suppression.5, 6, 12 If the repeat VL result after IAC is still non-suppressed, this is considered as virologic failure provided non-adherence to ART is ruled out. A switch committee is then convened to discuss switching the patient to another ART line.5 Several predisposing factors like poor ART adherence, unawareness about the ART benefits and other existing chronic illness, among others, have been associated with VL non-suppression.19, 20, 21 People living with HIV on ART with non-suppressed VL are at increased risk of faster progression to AIDS, which is also associated with poor clinical outcomes.21, 22\nTremendous progress has been achieved by several subSaharan African countries in establishing comprehensive VL testing programmes23; for instance, in Uganda, the number of annual VL tests has steadily increased annually from 16 411 VL tests (2% of people living with HIV on ART) in 2014 to 1 332 335 VL tests (95% of people living with HIV on ART) in 2020.24 Challenges affecting the scale-up of VL testing, like suboptimal sample transportation and results delivery, limited human resource in health facilities, unawareness about VL testing among HIV healthcare providers and people living with HIV, protracted procurement processes, and poor adherence to national and WHO VL testing guidelines, have limited full coverage of VL testing in the country.23, 25 The other key important issue to note with the introduction of VL testing is LLV."

No HIV transmission risks have been demonstrated below 400 copies/mL,38 but the range of viraemia between 400 copies/mL and 1000 copies/mL at which HIV transmission occurs, still remains unclear.39"

However this study did not examine HIV drug resistance, which could be a key driver of virologic failure (failure of people living with HIV with a non-suppressed VL to suppress after three sessions of IAC, and poor drug adherence has been ruled out), and also assessment of drug adherence was mainly through self reports which could have been affected by social desirability and recall bias.45\nFurthermore, in South Africa, LLV occurred in 23% of people living with HIV on ART with an incidence of 11.5 per 100 person-years of follow-up (95% confidence interval: 11.4\u201311.7), during first-line ART. In this study, LLV was associated with increased hazards ratios of virological failure and the subsequent switch to second-line ART, as compared with a non-dectectable VL of less than 50 copies/mL; and the risk of virological failure was increased more with increased ranges of LLV.7 This study did not look at HIV drug resistance testing results in LLV, because they were not available.\nIn another South African study looking at HIV viraemia and mother-to-child transmission risk after ART initiation in pregnancy in Cape Town, the risk of early HIV vertical\ntransmission was greatly associated with VL at delivery, with noted risks of 0.25%, 2.0% and 8.5% among women with VL < 50 copies/mL, 50 copies/mL \u2013 1000 copies/mL and > 1000 copies/mL at delivery, respectively (p < 0.001). This implies that women with LLV at delivery had eight times the risk of HIV vertical transmission, as compared to women with a non-detectable VL < 50.46\nIn Malawi, a study was conducted that comprised 1274 mothers and described VL suppression among HIVpositive mothers at 4\u201326 weeks postpartum, the factors associated with VL suppression, and the impact of VL suppression levels on mother-to-child transmission. This study indicated that 8.7% of these HIV-positive mothers had LLV and were more likely to be adolescents, who had been on ART for less than six months, with suboptimal adherence. LLV was associated with 7.0% risk of mother-to-child transmission, as compared to 0.9% risk for mothers with a non-detectable VL.47\nElsewhere, HIV drug resistance was detected in about 30.0% of people living with HIV with a VL test having the first episode of LLV in British Columbia; and these patients had an increased risk of developing virologic failure, compared to those without HIV drug resistance.48 Another study indicated that there were 44.0% accumulated resistance mutations in 47 people living with HIV on ART with two or more episodes of LLV, and surprisingly the median viraemia was 267 copies/mL; and virologic failure followed in 16.0% of these people living with HIV.49 In the United Kingdom, 30.0% of people living with HIV with LLV acquired at least one drug resistant mutation50; and major resistant mutations were detected in 12.7% of people living with HIV with LLV.51"

Furthermore, there is no data in Uganda and other sub-Sahara African countries to determine whether IAC can be effective in achieving a non-detectable VL among people living with HIV on ART with LLV.

With the advancing global targets to end the HIV epidemic, reduce transmission rates, and improve the clinical outcomes of the people living with HIV on ART, there is an inevitable need to re-assess the use of the threshold of 1000 copies/mL to determine VL non-suppression, and to establish strategies to address the rising proportions of people living with HIV on ART with unmanaged LLV in the region. More research about the association between LLV and drug resistance and virologic failure in sub-Sahara Africa also needs to be done."
