            "text": "Beneath the ice shell encasing Enceladus, a small icy moon of Saturn, a global ocean of liquid water (Postberg et al., 2009; Thomas et al., 2016) ejects geyser-like sprays into space through fissures concentrated near the south pole (Hansen et al., 2006; Howett et al., 2011; Spencer and Nimmo, 2013; Waite et al., 2017), making it one of the places with the highest potential of finding extra-terrestrial life. However, it remains a puzzle as to why all geysers concentrate near the south pole (Howett et al., 2011; Iess et al., 2014; Porco et al., 2007). Enceladus is tidally locked to Saturn with almost zero obliquity, and so tidal heating patterns will be almost perfectly symmetric between the two hemispheres in the absence of an asymmetry in the ice shell (Chen, E M A and Nimmo, F, 2011; Baland et al., 2016).\nIt has been suggested that hemispheric asymmetry could stem from an a-priori anomaly due to a giant impact and/or a monopole structure in geological activity (Han and Showman, 2010; Behounkova et al., 2012; Rozel, A et al., 2014; Roberts and Stickle, 2021). It is supposed that on geological timescales, this anomaly then moves over the south pole by true polar wandering (Nimmo and Pappalardo, 2006; Stegman et al., 2009; Tajeddine et al., 2017). However, given that currently there is only one such hot spot on Enceladus, implicit assumptions have to be made about the frequency of giant impacts and their recovery time.\nHemingway et al. (2019) propose that the ice shell could be torn apart by the overpressure induced by a freezing of the subsurface ocean. Since the ice shell is thinnest and hence weakest over the poles, due to the polar-amplified tidal dissipation in the ice shell and core (Beuthe, 2013; Choblet et al., 2017), the initial fracture would most likely occur at one of the poles. Once this happens, the pressure would be released thus preventing a similar event from happening over the other pole. The enhanced dissipation from polar venting will further thin the ice there.\nKang and Flierl (2020), instead, suggest that any small random asymmetry in ice shell thickness, be it induced by giant impacts (Roberts and Stickle, 2021), obliquity tides (Tyler, 2009)) or other mechanisms, can amplify on million-year timescales. The fastest growth occurs for thickness variations which have the gravest inter-hemispheric scale, significantly thinning the ice shell at one of the poles and thereby promoting fracture formation there. The hemispherically-asymmetric mode will grow and dominate over time for two reasons. First, rheology feedback makes thin regions of the ice shell weaker and more mobile which in turn generates more heat and yet more thinning (Beuthe, 2019)\u2014 this enhances all thickness variations uniformly. Second, ice flow is more efficient at smoothing out thickness variations which have small spatial scales than those with large scales (Ashkenazy et al., 2018). The combined action of these two processes can account, it is argued, for both the concentration of geysers over one pole and the significant hemispheric asymmetry in ice shell thickness.\nwanying@mit.edu (W. Kang); bire@mit.edu (.S. Bire); jmarsh@mit.edu (.J. Marshall) ORCID(s):\nKang et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 1 of 19\nWhatever the processes that influence the evolution of the ice shell, its freezing and melting will induce salinity changes just under the ice, and its thickness variations will strongly influence the temperature at the water-ice interface through the suppression of the freezing point of water with pressure \u2014 see Fig.1a. Thus one can expect lateral salinity and temperature gradients at the water-ice interface, both of which will drive ocean circulation. This circulation will in turn redistribute heat (Tyler, 2014), reshaping the ice shell by inducing freezing and melting (Kang et al., 2021). This interaction between the ice shell and the ocean just below it could provide an additional feedback, promoting, or otherwise, hemispheric symmetry breaking. The focus of the present work is to study the possible role of crossequatorial ocean heat transport in enhancing or diminishing inter-hemispheric asymmetries in ice thickness."

            "text": "We simulate the ocean circulation and its interaction with a poleward-thinning ice shell on an Enceladus-like icy satellite, introduce small inter-hemispheric asymmetries in ice thickness and explore the efficacy of cross-equatorial heat transport. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology ocean model (MITgcm, MITgcm-group, 2010; Marshall et al., 1997) is employed in a zonally-averaged setup similar to, but slightly different from, that described in (Kang et al., 2021). Instead of trying to understand the possible ocean circulation on Enceladus driven by the observed ice thickness variations, here we use the method of perturbations to study the feedbacks at play when the ice shell is assumed to be slightly asymmetric about the equator. Observations suggest a rather marked hemispheric asymmetry in ice thickness (Iess et al., 2014; Beuthe et al., 2016; Tajeddine et al., 2017; \u010cadek et al., 2019; Hemingway and Mittal, 2019) but our goal here is to investigate the ocean feedbacks \u2014 is a small asymmetry amplified or damped by ocean circulation and its associated ice-ocean interaction? Rather than the freezing/melting rate being prescribed, as in (Kang et al., 2021), here it depends on the circulation, allowing us to study feedbacks. Further details of the model configuration can be found in the supplementary materials (SM). Typically solutions take many thousands of years to reach equilibrium.\nThe assumed ice thickness profile, which thins toward the poles and is slightly asymmetric about the equator \u2014 thinner over the south pole than the north \u2014 is shown by the black solid line in Fig.1b. The suppression of the freezing point on increasing pressure leads to temperature variations beneath the ice which induces a circulation. This redistributes heat, and exchanges with the ice modulate the freezing/melting (as set out in detail in Eqs. 13, 14, SM). This in turn changes the salinity through brine rejection/freshwater production (Eq. 16, SM). In our model, however, the ice shell geometry is not allowed to evolve under the assumption that lateral ice flow maintains balance 1. Meanwhile, the core may also be a source of heat due to its tidal flexing, and is transmitted to the ocean through a bottom heat flux. Such core heating has been argued to be necessary to keep Enceladus from freezing up, given that the ice dissipation is likely insufficient at the present-day eccentricity (Beuthe, 2019; Choblet et al., 2017). According to Sandstrom\u2019s theorem (Wunsch, 2005, Malte Jansen, private communication), both temperature and salinity forcings from the ice and the core can drive ocean circulation if buoyancy sinks occur higher up the water column than buoyancy sources. Furthermore, vertical diffusion may provide additional energy to the system by pumping dense water upward (Young, 2010).\nThe normalized heat fluxes due to tidal dissipation in the shell and the core, together with the conductive heat loss through the ice shell, are shown in Fig. 1b. There the global-mean of the heat fluxes in the core and the ice shell are set equal to the global-mean conductive heat loss. In our experiments, the core/ice shell heat fluxes are also adjusted to guarantee that they exactly balance the globally-averaged conductive heat loss. Since regions with a thinner ice shell tend to be more dissipative (due to the ice rheology feedback) (Beuthe, 2019), heat production in the ice shell is concentrated over poles, and especially the south pole. Heating in the core, by contrast, is not affected by the ice thickness and is therefore assumed to be symmetric between the two hemispheres, as shown in Fig. 1b.\nUnder hemispherically-asymmetric forcing, a cross-equatorial overturning circulation forms in the ocean. If heat is carried from the northern hemisphere to the southern hemisphere by ocean circulation, the hemispheric asymmetry of ice thickness is enhanced, and vice versa. Given the limited knowledge of Enceladus\u2019 ocean salinity (Postberg et al., 2009; Zolotov, 2007; Zolotov and Postberg, 2014; Glein et al., 2018; Ingersoll and Nakajima, 2016; Hsu et al., 2015; Kang et al., 2021) and the partition of heat production between the ice shell and the silicate core (Choblet et al., 2017; Beuthe, 2019; Kang et al., 2020), a series of experiments were carried out covering a range of ocean salinities (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 psu) and core/shell heat partitions (0%/100%, 20%/80%, 40%/60%, 60%/40%, 80%/20%, 100%/0%).\n1We expect the results to remain similar with ice shell evolution on, and during the period of integration, we don\u2019t expect significant change of ice geometry due to the long adjusting timescale.\nKang et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 2 of 19\ntwo different pressures. Cold to warm colors denote increasing salinity (see legend). The pressure beneath the 26-km thick ice shell at the equator is used to compute the solid curves and the pressure beneath the 7-km south polar ice shell is used for the dashed curves. In each case the density at \u22125 \u25e6C is chosen as a reference. The circles indicate the freezing point, full circles at the base of the equatorial ice shell and open circles at the base of the south polar ice shell: note the rightward shift of the open circles, which indicate the freezing point increases moving from equator to pole.

The global-mean of tidal heating in the core and the ice shell are set equal to the global-mean conductive heat loss.\nHereafter, we use Sxsy to refer to the experiment with a x psu salinity and y% of heat generated in the shell, s. It should be noted that the ice shell heating rates used in scenarios in which it is the dominant heat source is perhaps 1 order of magnitude higher than the predictions of tidal dissipation models, given our current understanding of ice rheology (Beuthe, 2019). Although more advanced models of ice rheology can lead to more heat production (Gevorgyan et al., 2020), thus far, the attempt to fully account for purported heat losses has not yet been successful \u2014 see Robuchon\nKang et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 3 of 19\net al.

(2020).\nred) and northward (in blue) cross-equatorial heat transport, respectively. Among all profiles, we use a thicker and darker curve to show the case with the highest salinity and shell heating (S30s80), and with the lowest salinity and shell heating (S5s0). These two solutions, representative of northward and southward cross-equatorial heat transport, are shown in more detail in Fig. 3.\nA key finding of our study is summarized in Fig.2(a), where cross-equatorial heat transport is shown for various ocean salinities and core-shell heat partitions. We see that when most of the heating is assumed to be in the ice shell, ocean circulation tends to carry heat from the northern hemisphere to the southern hemisphere. This induces melting in the southern hemisphere where the ice shell is already thin, enhancing hemispheric asymmetry. The opposite happens when heating is assumed to dominate in the core. Ocean salinity plays a secondary role through its affect on the sign and magnitude of the thermal expansion coefficient, the slope of the curves shown in Fig.1a.\nWe use the direction of equatorial heat transport as a criterion to separate our experiments into two groups, one which enhances hemispheric asymmetry in the ice shell (negative/southward cross-equatorial heat transport) and the other that suppresses it (positive/northward cross-equatorial heat transport). Panel (b) and (c) in Fig.2 show the meridional heat transport profiles for the these two groups, respectively. Conspicuously, the pattern of heat transport profiles are broadly the same within each group, attesting to the similarity of their ocean circulation and thermodynamic states (not shown). The solution with the highest salinity and shell heating (S30s80\u2014 asymmetry-enhancing), and the lowest salinity and core heating (S5s0 \u2014 asymmetry-suppressing) are shown in more detail in Fig.3.\nBoth groups converge heat toward the equator, but the amplitude is much stronger in the asymmetry-suppressing group which have the preponderance of heating coming from the core. Since the global heat flux lost by the moon is around 35-40 GW (Beuthe, 2019), convergence of such large quantities of heat toward the equator, as is typical of asymmetry-suppressing scenarios, would ultimately lead to melting of the equatorial ice shell, rendering it impossible to sustain the observed equator-to-pole ice thickness gradient. A typical asymmetry-suppressing scenario has over 50%\nKang et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 4 of 19\nof the global heat flux (20-30GW) transported to the northern hemisphere, where the ice is thicker, sufficient to suppress the development of asymmetry. Furthermore, the observed asymmetry of Enceladus\u2019 ice shell is much stronger than prescribed here (Iess et al., 2014; Beuthe et al., 2016; Tajeddine et al., 2017; \u010cadek et al., 2019; Hemingway andMittal, 2019), making the situation even more problematic for retention of the observed ice shell geometry.\nIn the remainder of our paper, we describe the contrasting circulations of the asymmetry-enhancing and asymmetrysuppressing solutions and then go on to discuss the mechanisms that facilitate cross-equatorial heat transport and hence symmetry-breaking."

            "text": "In the ice shell-heating solutions, the highly polar-amplified heating profile (blue dashed curve in Fig.1b) induces melting over the poles (especially the south pole) and freezing elsewhere. This reduces the salinity over the polar regions compared to the equator (Fig.3-b1). Temperature is higher under the thin ice shell over the poles because the freezing point is higher when the ice shell is thinner. This is manifested by the rightward shift of the open circles (which indicate the freezing point at the base of the south polar ice shell) relative to the filled circles (marking the freezing point at the base of the equatorial ice shell) in Fig.1a. When salinity is higher than 22 psu (the case shown has a salinity of 30 psu), the thermal expansion coefficient of water (given by the slopes of the curves in Fig.1a) is positive. Thus both high temperature and low salinity make polar waters lighter than equatorial waters (Fig.3-c1). This induces downwelling in low latitudes and upwelling in high latitudes (Fig.3-d1). Through mixing of warm polar water with cold equatorial water, heat is converged toward the equator (Fig.2b).\nIf most heat is generated in the core, the heating profile is oblivious to the poleward-thinning ice shell geometry but, nevertheless, is slightly polar-amplified (red dashed curve in Fig.1b). Instead of being directly transmitted to the ice shell, this moderate polar amplification in heating is overwhelmed by the equatorward heat convergence (Fig.2c), leading to melting of ice at low latitudes and freezing at high latitudes. As a result, the salinity of equatorial (polar) waters is brought down (up), as can be seen in Fig.3-b2. Since the case shown has a salinity of 5 psu, lower than the 22 psu transition point, water expands upon cooling (Fig.1a). Thus, in contrast to the shell-heating group, both high temperature (Fig.3-a2) and high salinity (Fig.3-b2) make polar waters denser rather than lighter than equatorial waters. This drives an ocean circulation in the opposite direction to the shell-heating case, with sinking in high latitudes and upwelling in low latitudes (Fig.3-d2). The equatorward flow in the deeper ocean picks up heating from the seafloor, should it be present, carrying heat toward the equator. This is in addition to equatorward heat transport associated with mixing between polar water and equatorial water. The net result is a much stronger convergence of heat to the equator in this asymmetry-suppressing group compared to the asymmetry-enhancing group (Fig.2c).\nIt should be noted that heat is converged toward low latitudes in all experiments, just as described in Kang et al. (2021). This indicates that the ice thickness gradient between equator and poles will always be reduced by ocean circulation (Fig.2b,c). If this cannot be counterbalanced by polar-amplified tidal heating in the ice, the equator-to-pole thickness gradient will erode over time, leading to a state which would be inconsistent with the observed ice geometry (Iess et al., 2014; Beuthe et al., 2016; Tajeddine et al., 2017; \u010cadek et al., 2019; Hemingway and Mittal, 2019).\nFinally, we note that not only are the overturning circulations of the two solutions of opposite sign, but they are also slightly shifted relative to the equator, one north the other south. It is this shift that leads to cross-equatorial transport of heat and the possibility of symmetry-breaking in ice thickness, as we now discuss."

            "text": "Ocean circulation can enhance or suppress symmetry breaking by transporting heat across the equator. This can be facilitated by a circulation that straddles the equator connecting the two hemispheres together, much as our earth\u2019s ocean\u2019s overturning circulation connects the northern and southern hemispheres, resulting in cross equatorial heat transport in the Atlantic sector \u2014 see, for example, the review by Buckley and Marshall (2016). On earth, the ocean\u2019s are confined in basins defined by coasts that cross the equator and support western boundary currents. These boundary currents facilitate cross equatorial transport, for example in the giant meridional overturning circulation of the Atlantic ocean. In our simulations of Enceladus, there are no such topographic assists to cross-equatorial transport because, in the absence of observational constraints, our model assumes a flat bottom. Instead, the top and bottom boundaries provide the necessary friction and ageostrophic flow to support an overturning circulation. Due to the hemispheric asymmetry in the forcing, the overturning cells move (slightly) away from the equator, leading to cross-equatorial\nKang et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 5 of 19\ngroup and (column 2) the shell-heating, asymmetry-suppressing group.

The reference temperature and salinity (marked at the top of each plot) are subtracted from T and S enabling us to better capture the spatial patterns.

The grey shading in panel (c) delineates the possible ranges of cross-equatorial heat transport if only the bottom heating was redistributed. Dashed curves shown in panel (c) are the equilibrium eq for two groups of experiments initialized from different initial conditions. Red curves show the equilibrium eq against the core/shell heat partition for experiments initialized by the equilibrium fluid state of the experiment with 100% core-heating. Blue curves show the same but for experiments initialized using experiment with 80% heat generated in the ice shell.\nKang et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 7 of 19\nheat transport. In the asymmetry-enhancing cases, water crosses the equator in the interior ocean and returns near the surface (Fig.3-d1). The opposite is true in the asymmetry-suppressing cases (Fig.3-d2). We now build a simple model of the cross-equatorial heat transport. The cross-equatorial heat transport, eq, is jointly controlled by the inter-hemispheric mass exchange, which canbe measured by the vertically averaged mass-transport streamfunction at the equator,\u03a8eq, and by the top-minus-bottomtemperature difference \u0394zT . As can be seen in Fig.4b, the diagnosed cross-equatorial heat transport correlates verynicely with Cp\u03a8eq\u0394zT (here Cp = 4000 J/kg/ K is the heat capacity of water). When heat production is predominantlyin the core (denoted by reddish dots) equilibrium solutions are spread in the first quadrant of the diagram, which corresponds to energy gain in the northern hemisphere; when heat production is in the ice shell (bluish dots) solutions congregate in the third quadrant with southward heat transport at the equator. In all experiments, temperature increases with depth at the equator (\u0394zT < 0): for those with core heating, the bottom water is naturally warmer; for thosewithout, |\u0394zT | is much smaller but remains negative because the temperature at the equatorial water-ice interface isclose to the local freezing point, which is strongly depressed due to the thick ice shell there. We see then that the direction of inter-hemispheric heat transport is controlled by the sign of \u03a8eq.The cross-equatorial overturning, \u03a8eq, is driven by the density difference between the two hemispheres (Fig.3-c).The two correlate very well, as can be seen in the scatter plot in Fig.4a of \u03a8eq vs the pole-to-pole density difference N \u2212 S . This strong correlation is likely to stem from the positive feedback between the two variables: if water inthe northern hemisphere is generally denser than in the southern hemisphere ( N \u2212 S > 0), a positive \u03a8eq will beinduced. Given that \u0394zT < 0, ocean circulation will then transport heat into the southern hemisphere, facilitatingmelting there and further increasing the density contrast N \u2212 S . Ocean salinity affects the strength of this positivefeedback, by regulating the amount of salinity change induced per unit amount of freezing/melting. This is why high salinity experiments (denoted by dots of larger size) are found farther away from the origin in Fig.4a. In the presence of a positive feedback, the cross-equatorial circulation and heat transport, once activated, will amplify over time until being stabilized \u2014 as \u03a8eq strengthens, salinity gradients induced by the ice freezing/melting will be smoothed outmore readily, limiting the salinity gradient that can be sustained.\nConstrained positive feedback is known to be the key to systems which exhibit hysteresis and bistable behavior (Meadows et al., 1997). To seek multiple equilibrium solutions for each parameter set, we ran the same experiments across our salinity and core/shell heat partitions, but instead of initializing the model with zero salinity variations and zero flow, we used the equilibrium fluid state (temperature, salinity and flow field) of experiments with 0% shellheating, which exhibit strong northward heat transport across the equator and with 80% shell-heating, which exhibit strong southward heat transport. As shown by the dashed curves in Fig.4c, when initialized from the equilibrium state with 0% shell-heating (red dashed curves), more heat tends to be transported northward, in comparison to the same experiments initialized from the equilibrium state with just 80% shell-heating (blue dashed curves). Just as in a typical hysteresis diagram, the difference between the two sets of experiments maximizes when the heat partition is around 50-50 and vanishes when the core-heat-partition or shell-heat-partition approaches 100%.\nThe direction of the cross-equatorial circulation, and thereby the ocean feedback onto ice shell hemispheric asymmetry, is controlled by the initial pole-to-pole density difference, N \u2212 S , before any cross-equatorial circulation orheat transport has formed. If water in the northern hemisphere is slightly heavier, ocean circulation would transport heat to the southern hemisphere, enhancing the preexisting asymmetry; if the opposite is true, the asymmetry would be suppressed. In principle, the density can be affected by both salinity and temperature. However, salinity dominates over temperature except for the deep ocean in cases such as S5s0 (column-2 of Fig.3) \u2014 this corresponds to a fresh ocean with a significant amount of heating from the core; because of anomalous expansion, the ocean is much warmer at the bottom whilst remaining stable.\nSince salinity is always the dominant factor in setting pole-to-pole density differences thanks to the positive feedback, we must understand which of the poles freezes/melts relative to the other before cross-equatorial heat transport begins to develop. There are three mechanisms that affect this \u201cinitial\u201d freezing/melting: 1) conductive heat loss, cond, will be more efficient over the south pole due to the relatively thin ice there; 2) since the ice shell is thinnerover the south pole, more tidal heating,ice, is produced there as a result of the ice rheology feedback (Beuthe, 2019;Kang and Flierl, 2020), leading to melting; 3) the ice thickness gradient is stronger in the southern hemisphere, and so will induce more equator-to-pole mixing, more equatorward heat transport due to the ice-pump mechanism (Lewis and Perkin, 1986; Kang et al., 2021), and hence more freezing at the south pole. The first and the last processes suppress hemispheric symmetry-breaking, whereas the second mechanism enhances symmetry-breaking. Only when the ice shell produces most of the heat, does the second mechanism dominate resulting in enhanced melting over the south\nKang et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 8 of 19\npole (or less freezing) than the north pole. As time progresses the cross-equatorial ocean circulation then enhances this initial tendency. In this way, we can rationalize the ocean feedback on core/shell heat partition shown in Fig.2a.\nWhether melting of ice occurs more at the north pole vs the south pole depends on the sign of (see Eq.13): L\u0394q = \u0394cond \u2212 \u0394ice \u2212 \u0394ocn\nwhere \u0394 denotes the difference between the quantity evaluated over the north pole and the south pole and q is the freezing rate. The difference between cond and ice over the two poles can be quantified given that the ice over thesouth polar regions is about 30% thinner than that over the north pole (\u0394H\u2215H = 0.3, see black solid curve in Fig. 1b). Since the conductive heat losscond (Eq.8) is inversely proportional to the ice thicknessH and the ice tidal dissipation ice (Eq.10) is proportional toH raised to the power p (set to \u22122 in this study), the relative melt rate is:\nL\u0394q = \u2212cond \u0394H H \u2212 p ice \u0394H H \u2212 \u0394ocn\n= \u2212 [ cond + sp  (s=100%) ice ] \u0394H H \u2212 \u0394ocn, (1) where s is the percentage of heat produced by the ice, the superscript (s = 100%) denotes the 100% shell-heating scenario andocn denotes the heat flux transmitted from the ocean to the ice. As can be read off from Fig. 1b,s=100%iceis roughly 1.5 \u2013 2 times as large ascond in high latitudes. Therefore, more freezing occurs in the north relative to thesouth (\u0394q > 0) only if s > 30% with p = \u22122, if we neglect \u0394ocn. Since the ice pump mechanism will likely bestronger given the steeper ice topography in the south, \u0394ocn should make a positive contribution. This implies thatthe transition from asymmetry-suppressing to asymmetry-enhancing might occur at even higher s, aligned with our results (Fig.2a).\nTypically, once cross-equatorial heat transport has commenced, it strengthens over time whilst remaining the same sign, until an equilibrium is achieved. The absolute value ofeq increases asmore heat is generated in the core (Fig.4c).This is because \u0394zT becomes more negative because the ocean bottom is heated more in the presence of a strongerbottom heat flux. A consequence is that the strongest enhancement of asymmetry does not occur when heating is all produced in the shell. Instead, it occurs when the core makes a minor but non-negligible contribution to the total heat budget. As a by-product of the aforementioned positive feedback, in most cases the amplitude ofeq exceeds the totalhemispheric core heat production (grey shading in Fig.4c), especially when there is significant core heat production. Therefore, although bottom heating makes \u0394zT more negative and affects |eq|, it is the ocean-ice heat exchange thatpredominantly supports and balances the meridional heat transport.\nKnowing the ocean-ice heat exchange (Fig. 5a), tidal dissipation in the ice and the conductive heat loss, we can estimate the freezing/melting pattern for each scenario (Fig. 5b). This allows us to infer ice shell evolution by comparing this freezing rate with the thickness tendencies associated with the ice flow (the likely range is shown by the gray shading in Fig. 5), which transports ice from thick ice regions to thin ice regions under the influence of pressure gradient force (details of the ice flow model are given in appendix B). If the freezing rate is above the shaded zone, ice will grow and vice versa. In the shell-heating scenarios (shown by blueish curves), the hemispheric asymmetry will be enhanced. That said, the ocean heat transport mostly affects the low latitudes and mid-latitudes, inducing freezing around 20-60N and melting around 20S-20N. However, over geological timescales, the resultant thickness anomalies may be spread to the poles by ice flow. In contrast, the core-heating scenarios induce asymmetry which declines over time, due in part to the already weak ice-rheology feedback but also due to strong northward ocean heat transport. Moreover, because of the strong equatorward heat convergence in the core-heating scenarios 2, the equatorial (polar) ice shell will inevitably thin (thicken) over time, aided by poleward ice flow directed down the thickness gradient. This, together with the asymmetry suppression observed in the core-heating scenarios, suggests to us that the source of heat on Enceladus comes predominantly from its ice shell rather than core. Hydrothermal activity at the sea floor may, of course, be an important local energy source for circulation (and life) but, just as on earth, it may not account for a large portion of the total heat source on Enceladus.\n2Equatorward heat convergence melts the equatorial ice shell, reducing the local salinity and hence density, which in turn facilitates upward motions in the low latitudes. This will further enhance the equatorward heat convergence by bringing the bottom hot water toward equatorial ice shell. This cannot happen in experiments with prescribed freezing/melting rate as in Kang et al. (2021).\nKang et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 9 of 19\nthickness) and core-shell heat partitions (denoted by the line color). The freezing/melting pattern required to balance the ice flow given the prescribed ice geometry is shown by two gray dashed curves, assuming two different ice viscosities ( melt = 1013, 1014 Pa\u22c5s). Details of the ice flow model is given in appendix B. Since geysers over the south pole can remove significant amount of energy, and this process is not accounted for here, we set the \u201clower bound\u201d of the freezing rate (corresponding to melt = 1013 Pa\u22c5s) to negative infinity to the south of 60S. The gray shaded area in between is a measure of uncertainty."

            "text": "We have found that heat transport by ocean circulation enhances hemispheric symmetry-breaking in ice thickness when heating primarily occurs in the ice shell driven by ocean tides, whilst if heating is primarily from the core, the ocean circulation acts as a damping of ice thickness asymmetry.\nThe mechanisms leading to cross-equatorial heat transport are sketched in Fig. 6. In the shell-heating scenario, heating concentrates at the south pole (shown by red shading) because the ice shell is thinner and hence more mobile there (Beuthe, 2019; Kang and Flierl, 2020). The conductive heat loss is also more efficient over the south pole (the red curly arrows atop of the ice shell) but is overwhelmed by tide-induced local heating. As a result, the south pole melts relative to the north. Over time, northern hemisphere waters becomes saltier and denser than in the southern hemisphere, driving an ocean circulation that sinks in the north and rises in the south (arrows). Since waters underneath the thick equatorial ice shell are the coldest of the global ocean, due to freezing point depression, such a circulation transports heat into the southern hemisphere, further thinning the ice shell there. The ocean circulation, therefore, results in patterns of melting and freezingwhich enhances inter-hemispheric gradients in ice thickness. This is balanced by transport of ice directed down the thickness gradient within the ice shell.\nIf, instead, the silicate core were to be the dominant heat source (see Fig. 6b), the ocean\u2019s overturning circulation would reverse sign (arrows). This is because, even though core heat production remains symmetric between the two hemispheres, the south pole freezes more rapidly relative to the north due to the more efficient conductive heat loss there (red curly arrows at the top). With sinking now in the southern hemisphere and upwelling in the north, heat is transported northward across the equator reducing ice thickness in the north. The heat flux in the core heating case is typically much stronger than with shell-heating because the vertical temperature gradient at the equator is enhanced due to bottom heating. The ocean circulation, therefore, results in patterns of melting and freezing which reduce interhemispheric gradients in ice thickness. Since ice thickness gradients in the ice are also flattened by ice flow, it must be concluded that the end result is one in which ice thickness gradients have been smoothed out, at which point the ocean circulation and ice distributions would be symmetrically-disposed about the equator.\nThe above scenarios are not strongly affected by the ocean salinity, except that a salty ocean tends to facilitate a stronger positive feedback between the ice freezing/melting and the ocean circulation and thereby faster adjustment of ice shell geometry (see Fig.5).\nOur results suggest, then, that the observed highly asymmetric Enceladean ice shell geometry (Iess et al., 2014; Tajeddine et al., 2017; \u010cadek et al., 2019; Hemingway and Mittal, 2019) is consistent with the primary energy source for ocean circulation being in the ice shell rather than the core. Such high dissipation rates in the ice shell may\nKang et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 10 of 19\npotentially be achieved through multiple scenarios as suggested by Tyler (2009, 2011, 2014, 2020), although current tidal models have difficulty achieving the high ice dissipation rate assumed here (Robuchon et al., 2010; Shoji et al., 2013; B\u011bhounkov\u00e1 et al., 2013; McCarthy and Cooper, 2016; Beuthe, 2019; Soucek et al., 2019; Gevorgyan et al., 2020).\nFor icy moons of size greater than Enceladus, most notably Europa, we expect the ocean circulation and heat transport to increase as gravity and hence surface forcing become stronger. This is because the pressure gradient at the ocean-ice interface will increase with gravity, and so give rise to greater shifts of freezing point, stronger temperature gradients and hence drive stronger ocean circulations. As a result, the role of ocean circulation may be to flatten out any equator-to-pole ice shell gradients on icy moons of larger size. Moreover, asymmetry may also be suppressed because of more efficient equator-to-pole heat transport (i.e., greaterocn in Eq.1) and a weakening of the ice-rheologyfeedback (smaller ice\u2215cond in Eq.1).Finally, we should remind ourselves of the many caveats that accompany our study. First and foremost, to enable us to integrate our model long enough to reach equilibrium (many thousands of years), we use a zonally symmetric configuration in which transport by baroclinic eddies is missing. We note that meridional potential vorticity gradients change sign over the water column of our solutions (not shown), and so, by the Charney-Stern criterion (Charney and Stern, 1962), we might expect baroclinic instability to occur. These can facilitate jet formation and affect heat and tracer transport (Schneider, 2006). Their impact on cross-equatorial heat transport and the general circulation of icy moons is an important topic for future study. Moreover, convection is parameterized in our model rather than resolved, and the bottom heating is assumed to be uniformly distributed, albeit slightly poleward-amplified (red dashed curve in Fig.1b). Convective plumes may significantly affect heat transport, especially if the heat flux becomes geographically localised and more intense, as suggested by Choblet et al. (2017). We also leave such issues for future study.\nS Pole N PoleS Pole N Pole\n(a) shell-heating\nsu bs\nur fa\nce o\nce an\n(b) core-heating\nic e\nsh el\nl\nfreshocean circulation\nsalty\nheat\ncold\nwarm\nslow melting\nfreezing\nfast melting\noc ea n cir cu lat ion\nsalty\nheat\nfresh\ndiffusion\nslow\nmelting\nfast melting\ncold\nwarm\nfreezing\nice flow ice flow\nFigure 6: Schematics of ocean circulation and heat transport for the (a) shell-heating and (b) core-heating scenarios.

The horizontally-directed curly red arrow shows the lateral heat transport by ocean circulation. The red shading in the ice shell mark the patterns of tidal heating which peak over the poles where the ice is thin, largest over the south pole. Broad patterns of melting and freezing are marked, together with the rate, along with the associated salinity anomalies. Melting and freezing are balanced by lateral ice transport within the ice shell, directed from thick to thin. Rates of melting (fast, slow) are based on consideration of Fig. 5b. The broad patterns of anomalous overturning circulation in the ocean are indicated by the thick curved arrows, which are color-coded to indicate the salt transport. Dark brown denotes the flow of dense salty water, light yellow that of buoyant fresh water. The water is coldest just under the thickest ice, which occurs at the equator. The water beneath is warmer, in part due to bottom heating. Water properties in different parts of the ocean are indicated by text boxes.

            "text": "To explore whether ocean circulation enhances or suppresses hemispheric asymmetries in the thickness of the ice shell of Enceladus, wemodel the large-scale overturning circulation in the Enceladean ocean encased by a hemisphericallyasymmetric ice shell, and diagnose the resulting cross-equatorial heat transport. Given our uncertain knowledge of the mean salinity of the ocean and the partitioning of heat production in the core and the shell, we explore many (in fact 30) plausible combinations. The simulations are carried out using the state-of-the-art Massachusetts Institute of Technology ocean circulation model (MITgcm, MITgcm-group, 2010; Marshall et al., 1997) in a two-dimensional configuration (latitude and depth). The efficiency of the 2D setup enables us to integrate out the simulations to full equilibrium and explore a wide parameter space. Unless otherwise stated, initial current and salinity variations are set to zero and the initial potential temperature at each latitude set equal to the freezing point at the water-ice interface. From this initial state, each simulation is launched for 75,000 years, by which time equilibrium is reached.\nThe model integrates the non-hydrostatic primitive equations governing the motion of a fluid in height coordinates including a full treatment of all components of the Coriolis force. These components are typically ignored when simulating Earth\u2019s ocean because of its small aspect ratio (the ratio between depth and horizontal scale of the ocean basin), but is crucial for Enceladus\u2019s ocean, whose aspect ratio is instead order 40km\u2215252km\u223c 0.16 and so not small. The size of each grid cell shrinks with depth due to spherical geometry and is accounted for by switching on the \u201cdeepAtmosphere\u201d option of MITgcm. Since the depth of Enceladus\u2019s ocean is comparable to its radius, the variation of gravity with depth is significant. The vertical profile of gravity in the ocean and ice shell is given by, assuming a bulk density of out = 1000 kg/m3:\ng(z) = G [ M \u2212 (4 \u22153) out(a3 \u2212 (a \u2212 z)3) ]\n(a \u2212 z)2 . (2)\nIn the above equation,G = 6.67\u00d710\u221211 N/m2/kg2 is the gravitational constant andM = 1.08\u00d71020 kg and a = 252 km are the mass and radius of Enceladus.\nSince it takes many tens of thousands of years for our solutions to reach equilibrium, we employ a moderate resolution of 2 degree (8.7 km) and run in a 2D, zonal-average configuration whilst retaining full treatment of Coriolis terms. By so doing, zonal variations are omitted. In the vertical direction, the 60 km ocean-ice layer is separated into 30 layers, each of which is 2 km deep. The ocean is encased by an ice shell with meridionally-varying thickness using MITgcm\u2019s \u201cshelfice\u201d and ice \u201cboundary layer\u201d module (Losch, 2008). We employ partial cells to better represent the ice topography: water is allowed to occupy a fraction of the height of a whole cell with an increment of 10%.\nWe set the ice thicknessH to be slightly asymmetric between the two hemispheres and thin towards each pole: H( ) = H0 +H2P2( ) +H1P1( ), (3)\nwhereH0 = 20.8 km is the mean ice thickness. The constantsH2 = \u221212.1 km andH1 = 2 km set the equator-to-poleand pole-to-pole thickness variations, respectively and P1, P2 are the first and second Legendre Polynomials. Thethickness variation is plotted in the thick black solid curve in Fig. 1b. We explore a wide range of background salinities from 4 psu to 40 psu, and adopt a linear equation of state (EOS, which determines how density depends on temperature, salinity and pressure) to make the dynamics as transparent as possible. The dependence of potential density on potential temperature and salinity S is set equal to:\n( , S) = 0 [ 1 \u2212 T ( \u2212 0) + S (S \u2212 S0) ] (4)\n0 = ( 0, S0). (5) Here, 0, 0 andS0 are the reference potential density, potential temperature and salinity, and T and S are the thermalexpansion and haline contraction coefficients respectively, given by the first derivative of the density with respect to Kang et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 12 of 19\npotential temperature and salinity at the reference point, obtained using the Gibbs Seawater Toolbox (McDougall and Barker, 2011). We carried out two test experiments (one with S0 = 10 psu and the other with S0 = 20 psu) using thefull \u201cMDJWF\u201d equation of state (McDougall et al., 2003) and obtained almost identical results.\nS0 is prescribed a constant value between 5 psu and 30 psu. 0 is set to be the freezing temperature at S0 and P0 = 2.2 \u00d7 106 Pa (this is the pressure under a 20.8 km thick ice sheet on Enceladus). Generally, the freezing point Tfdepends on local pressure P and salinity S following\nTf (S, P ) = c0 + b0P + a0S, (6) where the constants are ascribed the following values: a0 = \u22120.0575 K/psu, b0 = \u22127.61 \u00d7 10\u22124 K/dbar and c0 = 0.0901 degC. The pressure P can be calculated using hydrostatic balance: P = igH where i = 917 kg/m3 is thedensity of the ice andH its thickness). A.1. Representation of subgridscale processes\nTo account for the mixing of momentum, heat and salinity by turbulence that is not resolved, we set the explicit viscosity/diffusivity to be much larger than molecular values. There is no attempt to represent baroclinic instability. The default horizontal and vertical diffusivity are set to 0.001m2/s to represent the mixing induced by high-frequency turbulence driven by tides and libration (Tyler, 2020). This is 3 orders of magnitude or so greater than the molecular diffusivity, but is consistent with the dissipation rate estimated by a recent study (Rekier et al., 2019), in which both libration and tidal forcing were accounted for. According to Rekier et al. (2019), the tidal dissipation in the ocean is mostly induced by librations with a global dissipation rate E of around 1 MW. Following the review of Wunsch and Ferrari (2004), the vertical diffusivity can be estimated as\nv = \u0393\" 0N2 , (7)\nwhere \u0393 \u223c 0.2 is the efficiency by which kinetic energy dissipation can be used to produce potential energy, \" = E\u2215V is the ocean dissipation rate per unit area, V = 4 a2D is the total volume of the Enceladean ocean, 0 \u223c 1000 kg/m3is the density of water, N2 = g() ln \u2215)z) \u223c g(\u0394 \u2215 0)\u2215D is the Brunt-Vaisala frequency. Assuming that \u0394 \u2215 0 isjust T\u0394Tf , where \u0394Tf is the equator-to-pole temperature contrast, setting T \u223c 1 \u00d7 10\u22125/K and \u0394Tf \u223c 0.1K , and substituting the above values into Eq.7, we find v \u223c 0.001m2/s. This is the default horizontal and vertical diffusivityused in our model. The diffusivity for temperature and salinity are set to be the same, so that any double diffusive effects are suppressed.\nDue to the relatively coarse model resolution, convective processes are not resolved. For regions that are convectively unstable, we overwrite the vertical diffusivity with a much greater value, 1m2/s, to represent the vertical mixing associated with small-scale convective motions. Such approaches are widely used to parameterize convection in coarse resolution ocean models. Results are not found to be sensitive to this choice as long as the associated diffusive time scale D2\u2215 conv \u2248 0.5 yr is much shorter than the advective time scaleMhalf\u2215\u03a8 \u2248 2000 yrs (Mhalf is half of the totalmass of the ocean and \u03a8 is the maximum meridional streamfunction in kg\u2215s).\nThe horizontal and vertical viscosity are set to 1m2/s to retain a smooth solution on the grid-scale and to make sure that the Ekman boundary layer is thick enough to be resolved. To damp grid-size noise induced by stair-like topography, we introduce a bi-harmonic hyperviscosity of 1\u00d7108m4/s and a bi-harmonic hyperdiffusivity of 1\u00d7107m4/s in addition to the harmonic mixing terms. Adding a scale-selective viscosity stabilizes the model and smooths the solution, whilst retaining large-scale features.\nTo demonstrate that the viscous terms indeed play a minor role, Fig. 7 shows, for one example case (S30s80), that the two terms in the thermal wind balance \u2014 2 \u22c5 \u2207U = )b\u2215a) \u2014 balance one-another. Since thermal wind is a consequence of geostrophic and hydrostatic balance, and on the large scale hydrostatic balance is always a good approximation, geostrophic balance must also be satisfied. A.2. Heat budget Heat is lost in our system through heat conduction across the ice shell, cond, which can be estimated using a 1Dvertical heat conduction model,\ncond = 0 H ln (Tf Ts ) , (8)\nKang et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 13 of 19\ngiven the thickness of the iceH (Hemingway and Mittal, 2019) (black solid curve in Fig. 1b), the surface Ts (set to theradiative equilibrium temperature of Enceladus assuming an albedo of 0.8) and an ice temperature near the water-ice interface, which, by definition, is the local freezing point Tf given by Eq. 6. This yields a heat loss rate of roughly 50 mW/m2, as shown by the green dashed curve in Fig. 1b of the main text). This loss is counterbalanced by tidal heating in the ice shell, ice. and the core, core. Heating in the shell isforced by ocean tides 3, but tidal dissipation within the ocean itself is likely to play only a secondary role due to the presence of the the ice shell (Chen, E M A and Nimmo, F, 2011; Beuthe, 2016; Hay and Matsuyama, 2019; Rekier et al., 2019), except if the ocean is in a resonant state Tyler (2008, 2011, 2014). For each assumed heat partition, we use the same heating profiles for core and ice (see below).According to Beuthe (2019) and Choblet et al. (2017), the core dissipationcore peaks at the two poles. We obtainthe meridional heat profile using Eq.60 in Beuthe (2019) (Beuthe, 2020, private communication,\ncore( ) = core( ) = core \u22c5 (1.08449 + 0.252257 cos(2 ) + 0.00599489 cos(4 )), (9) where is the latitude andcore is the global mean heat flux at the bottom. Since the global surface area shrinks goingdownward due to the spherical geometry, a factor of (a \u2212H)2/ (a \u2212H \u2212D)2 (H is ice thickness, D is ocean depth) needs to be taken into account when computing core. The expression within the brackets above is normalized overthe globe, and adjusted to take account of the fact that our model only covers 84S-84N. The above formula yields a bottom heat flux that is polar-amplified, as shown by the red dashed curve in Fig. 1b of the main text. This is prescribed as an upward geothermal heat flux from the lower boundary. The remaining heat loss is balanced by tidal dissipation in the ice shell ice. We calculate ice using the thin iceshell model described in Beuthe (2019). Tidal dissipation consists of three components (Beuthe, 2019): a membrane mode memice due to the extension/compression and tangential shearing of the ice membrane, a mixed mode mixice dueto vertical shifting, and a bending modebendice induced by the vertical variation of compression/stretching. Following Beuthe (2019), we first assume the ice sheet to be completely flat and solve for the dissipation rate f lat,xice (where x = {mem,mix, bend}). The ice properties are derived assuming a globally-uniform surface temperature of 60K and a melting viscosity of 5 \u00d7 1013 Pa\u22c5s.\nIce thickness variations are accounted for by multiplying the membrane mode dissipation f lat,memice , by a factorthat depends on ice thickness. This makes sense because it is the only mode which is amplified in thin ice regions (see Beuthe, 2019). This results in the expression:\nice = (H\u2215H0)p  f lat,mem ice + f lat,mix ice + f lat,bend ice , (10)\nwhereH is the prescribed thickness of the ice shell as a function of latitude andH0 is the global mean ofH . The tidalheating profiles are given as follows, f lat,memice = A ( Y00 + 0.25Y20 + 0.0825Y40 ) (11)\nf lat,memice + f lat,bend ice = A ( 0.124Y00 + 0.196Y20 \u2212 0.0199Y40 ) , (12) where Y00, Y20, Y40 are spherical harmonics and A is a constant factor used to adjust the amplitude of ice.Since thin ice regions deform more easily and produce more heat, p is negative. Because more heat is producedin the ice shell, the overall ice temperature rises, which, in turn, further increases the mobility of the ice and leads to more heat production (the rheology feedback). We set p = \u22122 here. ice, rescaled to balancecond, is shown by theblue solid curve in Fig. 1b. Those who are interested in further details of the model are encouraged to read Beuthe (2019). A.3. Water-ice interaction\nThe interaction between the ocean and ice is simulated using MITgcm\u2019s \u201cshelf-ice\u201d package (Losch, 2008; Holland and Jenkins, 1999). We turn on the \u201cboundary layer\u201d option to avoid possible numerical instabilities induced by an ocean layer which is too thin. The code is modified to account for a gravitational acceleration that is very different from that on earth, the temperature dependence of heat conductivity, and the meridional variation of tidal heating generated\n3There have been some misunderstanding in the literature regarding whether crust (i.e., the ice shell) dissipation driven by ocean tide should be counted as ice dissipation or ocean dissipation. A detailed literature review and discussion is available in Tyler (2020).\nKang et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 14 of 19\ninside the ice shell and the ice surface temperature. Following Kang et al. (2020), the freezing/melting rate of the ice shell is determined by a heat budget for a thin layer of ice at the base4. The budget involves three terms: the heat transmitted from the ocean to the iceocn (positive upward), the heat loss through the ice shell due to heat conduction cond (Eq.8), and the tidal heating generated inside the ice shell ice (Eq.10). As elucidated in Holland and Jenkins(1999) and Losch (2008), the continuity of heat flux and salt flux through the \u201cboundary layer\u201d gives,\nocn \u2212cond +ice = \u2212Lf q \u2212 Cp(Tocn\u2212top \u2212 Tb)q (13) ocn = \u2212Sbq \u2212 (Socn\u2212top \u2212 Sb)q, (14)\nwhere q denotes the freezing rate in kg\u2215m2\u2215s, ocn denotes the salinity flux (positive upward), Tocn\u2212top and Socn\u2212top is the temperature and salinity in the top grid of the ocean5, Tb and Sb denote the temperature and salinity in theimaginary \u201cboundary layer\u201d, where the water is just at the freezing point. Cp = 4000 J/kg/K is the heat capacity of theocean, Lf = 334000 J/kg is the latent heat of fusion of ice. The last terms in Eq.13 and Eq.14 are associated with thewarming/cooling and salinification/freshening required to convert ocean water to water in the \u201cboundary layer\u201d.\nocn and ocn in Eq.13 can be written as ocn = Cp( 0 T \u2212 q)(Tocn\u2212top \u2212 Tb), (15) ocn = ( 0 S \u2212 q)(Socn\u2212top \u2212 Sb) (16)\nwhere T = S = 10\u22125 m/s are the exchange coefficients for temperature and salinity, and Tb denotes the and tem-perature in the \u201cboundary layer\u201d. The terms associated with q are the heat/salinity change induced by the deviation of Tocn\u2212top, Socn\u2212top from that in the \u201cboundary layer\u201d, where melting and freezing occur. Tb equals the freezingtemperature Tf (Sb, P ) (Eq.6) at pressure P and salinity Sb by definition. 0 is the reference density (Eq.5).The only two unknowns, Sb and q, in Eq. (13) and Eq. (14) can therefore be solved jointly. When freezing occurs(q > 0), salinity flux w0 S (Socn\u2212top \u2212 Sb) is negative (downward). This leads to a positive tendency of salinity at thetop of the model ocean, together with changes of temperature.\ndSocn\u2212top dt = \u2212ocn w0 z = 1 w0 z ( w0 S \u2212 q)(Sb \u2212 Socn\u2212top) = qSocn\u2212top w0 z\n, (17) dTocn\u2212top\ndt = \u2212ocn Cp w0 z = 1 w0 z ( w0 T \u2212 q)(Tb \u2212 Tocn\u2212top)\n= 1 Cp w0 z [ ice \u2212cond + Lf q + Cp(Tocn\u2212top \u2212 Tb)q ] (18)\nwhere z is the thickness of the upmost ocean grid.

The ice flows down its thickness gradient, driven by the pressure gradient induced by the spatial variation of the ice top surface, somewhat like a second order diffusive process. At the top, the speed of the ice flow is negligible because the upper part of the shell is so cold and hence rigid; at the bottom, the vertical shear of the ice flow speed vanishes, as required by the assumption of zero tangential stress there. This is the opposite to that assumed in the land ice sheet model. In rough outline, we calculate the ice flow using the expression below obtained through repeated vertical integration of the force balance equation (the primary balance\n4This choice is supported by the fact that most tidal heating is generated close to the ocean-ice interface (Beuthe, 2018). 5When model resolution is smaller than the boundary layer thickness, the salinity below the upper-most grid cell also contributes to Tocn\u2212topand Socn\u2212top.\nKang et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 15 of 19\nSymbol Name Definition/Value\nand Whitworth (1999).\nbalance, 2 \u22c5 \u2207U and )b\u2215a) , respectively. \u03a9 is the rotating angular speed, U is the zonal flow speed, b = \u2212g( \u2212 0)\u2215 0 is buoyancy, a is the moon\u2019s radius and denotes latitude.
