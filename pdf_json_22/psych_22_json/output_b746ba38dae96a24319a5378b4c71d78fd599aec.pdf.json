This research attempted to explore the association between\nsocial creativity and aggressive behavior as well as the moderating role\nof hostile attribution bias. Data were obtained from 496 junior high\nschool students in two cities in China using a convenience sampling\ntechnique. The results showed that different aspects of social creativity were\ndifferent related to aggressive behavior. Specifically, appropriateness was\nnegatively, and harmfulness was positively related to aggressive behavior;\nHowever, the relation between originality and aggressive behavior was not\nsignificant. In addition, hostile attribution bias moderated the relationships\nbetween appropriateness/harmfulness and aggressive behavior. Specifically,\nthe negative relation between appropriateness and aggressive behavior\nas well as the positive relation between harmfulness and aggressive behavior\nbecame non-significant when hostile attribution bias was low. Implications of\nthis study are also discussed.\nKEYWORDS\nsocial creativity, originality, appropriateness, harmfulness, aggressive behavior, hostile attribution bias\nIntroduction\nCreativity, defined as the capability to generate useful and novel ideas (Runco and Jaeger, 2012), plays a significant role in adolescents\u2019 survival and success (Florida, 2002). Creativity is generally considered a positive cognitive ability (L\u00fcdeke et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2021). However, it is becoming increasingly recognized that creativity might also have dark aspects. On the one hand, researchers have started to focus on creativity that might threaten or harm others, such as malevolent creativity (Cropley et al., 2008;\nFrontiers in Psychology 01 frontiersin.org\nHarris and Reiter-Palmon, 2015; Gao et al., 2022) and negative creativity (Clark and James, 1999; James et al., 1999; Cropley et al., 2014). On the other hand, studies have indicated that creativity is associated with problem behaviors. For example, Cropley et al. (2008) found that creativity was correlated with criminal actions. Gino and Ariely (2012) also observed that highly creative students were inclined to cheat more often than less creative students. Research on the dark side of creativity has broadened the understanding of creativity and has led to a move away from a focus on only the beneficial aspects of creativity.\nResearch on the dark side of creativity is on the rise, and some studies have begun to focus on the association between creativity and aggression. However, the relationship between creativity and aggressive behavior has been inconsistent or equivocal. Some scholars have argued that creativity can reduce aggression (Lubart et al., 2004). The reason is that when individuals encounter interpersonal conflicts, creative answers can be substituted for \u201cfighting\u201d responses (Mouchiroud and Bernoussi, 2008). However, others have suggested a positive correlation between creativity and aggressive behavior (Saggar et al., 2019; L\u00fcdeke et al., 2020). Highly creative individuals look for creative solutions that benefit themselves (Cropley et al., 2008) and tend to break the rules and law (Petrou et al., 2018). They fear social labeling less, which may enable them to develop and carry out creative ideas to perform aggressive behavior (L\u00fcdeke et al., 2020). Empirical results have also been unclear: studies have found positive (e.g., Tacher and Readdick, 2006; Cheng et al., 2021), negative (e.g., Baquedano and Lizarraga, 2012), and no significant (e.g., Hao et al., 2020) relationships between creativity and aggressive behavior. These arguments and inconsistent conclusions might suggest that additional research is needed to clarify the association between creativity and aggression.\nAggressive behavior is a negative aspect of interpersonal interactions. Research has shown that interpersonal problemsolving skills have a long-term positive impact on an individual\u2019s social adjustment, including enabling children to develop harmonious interpersonal relationships and to effectively resolve interpersonal conflicts (Frye and Goodman, 2000; Gu et al., 2014). Considering the domain specificity of creativity (Li C. et al., 2020), aggressive behavior might be more sensitive to creativity in the interpersonal domain. Therefore, the present study examined the relationship between social creativity, referring to creativity in interpersonal problem-solving, and aggressive behavior."

            "text": "Social creativity is defined as an individual\u2019s capability to generate appropriate and novel ideas when solving interpersonal\nAbbreviations: SC, social creativity; HAB, hostile attribution bias.\nproblems (Mouchiroud and Lubart, 2002; Zhang et al., 2013). Regarding the criteria of social creativity, scholars hold different perspectives. For example, Zhang et al. (2013) investigated elementary school students\u2019 social creativity in terms of fluency, originality, and appropriateness. Gu et al. (2014) indicated criteria of social creativity include five dimensions: novelty, appropriateness, fluency, flexibility, and effectiveness in a sample of 210 adolescents. More recently, using a sample of 34 participants, Wang et al. (2018) evaluated social creativity in terms of originality, appropriateness, and usefulness. Based on the definition of social creativity and the previous studies, originality and appropriateness have always been considered the two fundamental elements of social creativity (Zhang et al., 2013; Gu et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2018). Originality refers to the uniqueness or rareness of a view, and appropriateness is defined as the effectiveness and feasibility of ideas (Runco and Jaeger, 2012).\nHowever, harmfulness as important criteria has been ignored in the evaluation of social creativity. Hao et al. (2016) pointed out that the ideas generated for interpersonal problems might be neutral, benevolent, or even malevolent. That is, harmful ideas might also be generated when solving interpersonal problems. According to the \u201cmotivation to be creative\u201d model, a negative disposition with the goal of being creative is likely to produce negative creativity (James and Taylor, 2010). In other words, when driven by negative dispositions, individuals might generate harmful ideas. However, ideational harmfulness has been considered important criteria mostly in malevolent creativity (Cheng et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2022). On the other hand, the effect of harmfulness is usually different from other dimensions. For example, Lee and Dow (2011) examined the relations between creativity assessed with alternative uses tasks and aggressive behavior. They found that ideational harmfulness was positively associated with aggressive behavior, while no such correlation was found in ideational fluency. To provide a more complete and detailed framework of social creativity, it is necessary to consider harmfulness as criteria of social creativity. Thus, the present study evaluated social creativity by assessing the originality, appropriateness, and harmfulness of the ideas generated.\nSocial creativity and aggressive behavior\nAs social creativity is a multidimensional structure, the relationship between it and aggressive behavior may be complex. Yet, there is no direct evidence of the association between the two. Therefore, the present study will examine the relations between social creativity and aggressive behavior in terms of three dimensions: appropriateness, harmfulness, and originality.\nAs for appropriateness, it represents the extent to which problem-solving is appropriate and feasible (Zhang et al., 2013).\nFrontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org\nJaffee and D\u2019Zurilla (2003) found that more adaptive problemsolving abilities were negatively associated with children\u2019s aggression in a sample of 117 high school students. Similarly, Blair et al. (2000) found that teaching students specific social skills was associated with lower aggression. In addition, Takahashi et al. (2009) also found that children generating prosocial solutions in realistic situations negatively predicted aggressive behavior. This suggests that appropriateness may inhibit aggression to some extent, and when individuals come up with more appropriate and feasible solutions to interpersonal problems, they tend to avoid harming and attacking others. Therefore, we anticipated that appropriateness would be negatively associated with aggressive behavior.\nSeveral researchers have explored the relationship between harmfulness and aggressive behavior. For example, Lee and Dow (2011) found that students\u2019 harmful ideas in a divergent thinking task were positively related to physical aggression in a sample of university students. Other studies have indicated a positive correlation between the harmfulness and implicit aggression of malevolent creativity in the interpersonal aspects of daily life (Harris and Reiter-Palmon, 2015; Cheng et al., 2021). These findings suggest that harmfulness is positively related to aggressive behavior. Although the above results were found in the contexts of malevolent creativity, the harmfulness of malicious and non-malicious contexts has common in threatening or harming others. Thus, we hypothesized that the harmfulness of social creativity may also have positive correlations with aggressive behavior.\nRegarding the relationship between originality and aggression, related research is scarce and the results are inconsistent. A study focusing on originality found a positive correlation between second-grade students\u2019 originality in creativity tests and verbal aggression (Tacher and Readdick, 2006). Yet, Hao et al. (2020) failed to find support for the relations between originality and aggression in malevolent creativity. As the findings on originality are inconclusive, we did not hypothesize the relationships between originality and aggressive behavior.\nThe moderating role of hostile attribution bias\nAnother reason for the inconsistent relations between social creativity and aggressive behavior might be the ignorance of other important factors. The general aggression model (GAM) argues that certain traits predispose individuals to perform aggressive behavior, and hostile attribution bias is one trait type of people who frequently attack others (Anderson and Bushman, 2002). Nasby et al. (1980) defined hostile attribution bias as a tendency for individuals to be more prone to attribute hostile motives to other people\u2019s behaviors in an interpersonal situation. Studies have shown that when individuals have high\nhostile attribution bias, they focus more on negative cues (Dodge and Newman, 1981) and are more prone to have negative psychological feelings and behavioral reactions (Qi et al., 2020). Therefore, the present research further explored the moderating role of hostile attribution bias in the link between adolescents\u2019 social creativity and aggressive behavior.\nPrevious studies suggested that hostile attribution bias may be a risk factor. For example, Ellis et al. (2009) found that as hostile attribution bias increased, the association between planning deficits and reactive aggressive behavior increased in a positive direction. Similarly, Osa et al. (2018) proposed that the positive correlation between oppositional behavior and aggression was stronger when children had a high level of relational hostile bias. Li X. et al. (2020) also found that the relation between alexithymia and aggressive behavior was stronger for students with higher hostile attribution bias. One possible reason is that students with a hostile viewpoint of social relations tend to perceive the threat of resource loss (Zhou et al., 2015) and may engage inappropriately, thus predicting subsequent aggressive behavior (Ellis et al., 2009). Thus, according to this \u201crisk\u201d view of hostile attribution bias, when individuals have high hostile attribution bias, the promotion of harmfulness on aggressive behavior will be strengthened, and the inhibitory effect of appropriateness on aggressive behavior will be destroyed. Based on the above reasons, we hypothesized that hostile attribution bias would moderate the association between adolescents\u2019 social creativity and aggressive behavior. Specifically, a high level of hostile attribution bias might strengthen the positive correlation and weaken the negative relationship. The conceptual model is summarized in Figure 1."

An example of a situational problem is as follows: \u201cImagine that there is a TV program that you truly want to watch. Imagine that your parents do not agree. What could you do?\u201d Participants were required to come up with as many creative solutions as possible to solve this problem.

The original scores were given scores based on their statistical rarity. The opinions given by < 2, 2\u20134.99, and > 5% participants were respectively given points of \u201c2,\u201d \u201c1,\u201d and \u201c0\u201d (Liu et al., 2013). Appropriateness was defined as the appropriateness and feasibility of the ideas given by participants as a solution and the degree of appropriateness. Harmfulness was defined as the respondents\u2019 degree of malevolence in the solutions. Three well-trained raters evaluated the appropriateness and harmfulness scores independently for each problem for each participant. Appropriateness scores for each problem using a 0\u20132 scale (0 = not appropriate at all; 2 = very appropriate) (Zhang et al., 2013).

Simple slope analyses indicated that for students with high hostile attribution bias (1 SD above the\nFIGURE 2 The moderating role of hostile attribution bias in the correlation between appropriateness and aggressive behavior.

            "text": "An increasing number of studies have focused on the dark side of creativity. The present research contributes to the literature by examining the relations between social creativity and aggressive behavior as well as the moderating role of hostile attribution bias. The results showed that originality, appropriateness, and harmfulness were related differently to adolescents\u2019 aggressive behavior. In addition, hostile attribution bias moderated the relations between appropriateness/harmfulness and aggressive behavior, and the higher the hostile attribution bias was, the stronger the relationships. Our results partially support the hypothesis proposed.\nThe different relationships between appropriateness/harmfulness/originality and aggressive behavior\nThe present research found that appropriateness had a significant negative correlation with Chinese students\u2019 aggressive behavior. These results agreed with previous findings in Western culture (e.g., Blair et al., 2000; Jaffee and D\u2019Zurilla, 2003). Individuals with high appropriateness might have high interpersonal problem-solving skills and engage in feasible and effective behaviors. They generate adaptive solutions and engage less in aggression when dealing with interpersonal conflict (Lubart et al., 2004). This is especially true in the context of Chinese culture. Influenced by collectivistic values, individuals emphasize more on interpersonal relationships, individual compliance with the collective, and adherence to social norms and standards (Lin, 2009). This may be the reason why Chinese children come up with more appropriate problem-solving strategies. They prefer to have their problemsolving strategies recognized by society and conform to specific social norms so that the strategies or approaches can reduce interpersonal tensions and conflict.\nIn addition, the present study found that harmfulness was significantly positively correlated with aggressive behavior. This result was consistent with previous research that reported a positive correlation between the harmfulness and implicit aggression of malevolent creativity (Cheng et al., 2021). The study also confirmed the theoretical expectations of the \u201cmotivation to be creative\u201d model, which postulated that individuals generate creative ideas that may direct them toward a harmful or malevolent goal (James and Taylor, 2010). Meanwhile, in our study, we found that approximately 71.4% of students had more or less harmful ideas. Therefore, harmfulness is an essential dimension and should be considered when evaluating social creativity. Participants with higher harmfulness scores produced many more malevolent views in solving interpersonal problems and ideas and solutions were often used defensively (Hao et al., 2016). These harmful views\nmay promote destructiveness, making individuals more likely to break social norms (Harris and Reiter-Palmon, 2015), and might contribute to their aggression.\nRegarding the relationship between originality and aggression, previous studies have not reached consistent results (Tacher and Readdick, 2006; Hao et al., 2020). This may indicate that the role of originality in influencing aggression is multifaceted. On the one hand, children with high originality but combined with high harmfulness may be more likely to break rules and laws, leading to more delinquent and aggressive behaviors; on the other hand, under conflict situations, children with high originality while combined with high appropriateness may be more capable of generating alternative resolution strategies to avoid aggressive behaviors. These complex differential associations between originality and aggression may be a possible explanation for the absence of a link between originality and aggression found in the current study. This result may also suggest that when examining the relationship between creativity and child outcomes, it is necessary to discriminate the different components of creativity and to consider their joint influence on developmental outcomes.\nThe moderating role of hostile attribution bias between harmfulness/appropriateness and aggressive behavior\nGuided by the GAM, this research further examined how hostile attribution bias moderated the relations between harmfulness/appropriateness and aggressive behavior. The results showed that hostile attribution bias served as a moderator for the relation between harmfulness, appropriateness, and aggressive behavior. Specifically, harmfulness was more strongly positively related to aggressive behavior when hostile attribution bias was high, and the positive relations became non-significant under low hostile attribution bias. The reason might be that when adolescents have responses shaped by hostile cue encoding, they tend to focus on and adapt harmful ideas to interpersonal problem-solving (Verhoef et al., 2019), thus resulting in aggression. This is consistent with prior studies in which hostile attribution bias might be a risk factor (Lyu et al., 2016; Osa et al., 2018). In contrast, when adolescents had low hostile attribution bias, the positive relation between harmfulness and aggressive behavior was not significant. This suggested that as the level of hostile attribution bias decreased, harmfulness was less likely to trigger aggression. This finding indicated that low hostile attribution bias may work as a protective factor and reduce aggressive behavior among adolescents who hold harmful ideas. Individuals with a low level of hostile attribution bias tend to perceive others as understandable and excusable (Lyu et al., 2016), causing their harmful ideas to remain in the realm of cognition and not be applied in reality.\nFrontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org\nIn contrast with our hypothesis, the results showed that when adolescents had high hostile attribution bias, appropriateness was more negatively related to aggressive behavior, and the negative relations became non-significant under low hostile attribution bias. This implies that appropriateness was effective in inhibiting aggression when individuals had high levels of hostile attribution bias. The reason might be that high hostile attribution bias motivates children who hold feasible and appropriate strategies to act on these positive cognitions, thereby reducing negative behaviors (Ellis et al., 2009). Previous literature also reported that problem-solving skills more strongly predicted adult male violence than hostile attribution bias (Kelty, 2013). In contrast, adolescents with low hostile attribution bias tended to engage less in aggressive behavior; thus, the effect of appropriateness was not significant.\nTaken together, our findings suggest that hostile attribution bias plays a different role in the relationships between harmfulness/appropriateness and aggressive behavior. When hostile attribution bias acts as a risk factor, adolescents who hold more harmful ideas may be more likely to act on these ideas and engage in aggressive behavior. This shows that high hostile attribution bias may promote positive relations. On the other hand, when hostile attribution bias acts as an interpersonal \u201carousal\u201d factor, it motivates or spurs adolescents who hold more appropriate ideas to reduce aggressive behavior. This shows that high hostile attribution bias may also enhance the negative relations. Notably, low hostile attribution bias acts as a protective factor and may weaken the positive relationship between harmfulness and aggressive behavior."

Firstly, this research was a cross-sectional study used to explore the relationships between social creativity and aggressive behavior, and definitive statements about causality should not be made based on the results of the research. Thus, a longitudinal study is needed to investigate the causal link between social creativity and aggression. Secondly, this study did not find a significant correlation between originality and aggressive behavior. One possible reason might be that the effect of originality on aggressive behavior depends on originality combined with what level of appropriateness and harmfulness. Future research could adopt a person-centered method to test the relationship between different types of social creativity style (the combinations of different levels of originality, appropriateness, and harmfulness) and aggressive behavior. Thirdly, hostile attribution bias was the only potential moderator examined in this research, but other moderators, such as personality and social support, also should be identified and tested in future research."

            "text": "This research contributes to the literature in some aspects. Firstly, the present study adds the harmfulness dimension when evaluating social creativity. The frequency of harmful ideas and the positive effect of harmfulness on aggressive behavior found in our study support the necessity of adding harmfulness. Secondly, this study indicates that different aspects of social creativity have different effects on aggressive behavior, which allows a more comprehensive and clearer understanding of the role of social creativity in adolescents\u2019 aggressive behavior. Our results, to a certain extent, shed light on the existing inconsistent results. Moreover, we identify an important boundary condition between social creativity and aggressive behavior. Our finding indicates that multiple traits of individuals, such as appropriateness and harmfulness of social creativity and hostile attributions, may interact with adolescents\u2019 aggressive behavior.\nIn addition, this research has certain application significance. First, this study illustrates the impact of appropriateness on reducing aggressive behavior and the role of harmfulness in triggering aggressive behavior. This prompts teachers and parents not only to focus on the beneficial role of social creativity but also to pay more attention to the dark side of creativity. This suggests that they can reduce the occurrence of problem behaviors by enhancing students\u2019 feasibility and appropriateness in interpersonal problem-solving and reducing the production of harmful ideas. Moreover, appropriateness and harmfulness of social creativity and hostile attributions work together in aggressive behavior. Teachers and parents can use cognitive training to reduce adolescents\u2019 aggression. Hostile attribution bias is modifiable (Van Bockstaele et al., 2020). This finding may suggest that training-induced changes in bias may be a useful approach to decrease adolescents\u2019 aggression. Specifically, the ability to generate appropriate ideas in solving interpersonal problems is important when adolescents have high hostile attribution bias. At the same time, it may be a good way to provide positive attribution training to suppress the negative effect of harmfulness on aggressive behavior."
