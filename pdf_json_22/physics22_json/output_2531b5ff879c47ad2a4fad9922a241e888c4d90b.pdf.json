We treat possible deviations in the background metric with additional coefficients with respect to the original works. The advantages of this reformulation are clear when applied to a parameter estimation problem, since the coefficients are always real, and many of them do not depend on the overtone number and angular momentum of the frequency, thus eventually reducing the total amount of parameters to be inferred.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nOngoing and future efforts of gravitational wave detectors provide unprecedented access to test general relativity (GR) in the strong field regime [1\u20134]. Among the several exciting possibilities, one is to perform black hole spectroscopy in order to verify the validity of the requirements of the no-hair theorem and also general relativity itself [5\u20137]. Our current understanding of binary black hole mergers predicts that the final stage of such events should be described by a superposition of linear perturbations of the background, the so-called quasi-normal modes [8\u201310], see also Refs. [11\u201314] for reviews.\nThe spectrum of quasi-normal modes is sensitive to the background perturbed metric, but also to the dynamical behaviour of the theory in which the perturbations are excited. The purpose of this work is to provide a framework which allows one to study quasi-normal modes in spherical symmetry for metrics which are different from the Schwarzschild metric when the modifications are small. Our framework follows a prescription similar to the one presented by Cardoso et al. [15] and McManus et al. [16]. In these works, a modified (system) of wave equations has been introduced and the corresponding quasi-normal mode spectrum has been computed up to quadratic order for a set of small deviation parameters. We explicitly show how possible deviations in the background metric could affect the quasi-normal frequencies, in a different fashion compared to [15, 16]. While the general idea is similar, our approach allows for a better description of non-Schwarzschild backgrounds, purely real deviation parameters in the framework, as well as a differentiation between the parameters that depend on the angular momentum of the frequencies and those which do not.\nThis work is structured as follows. In Sec. II we introduce the metric dependent parametrized framework. We apply it to two different cases in Sec. III. Conclusions are discussed in Sec. IV. Throughout this work we use units in which G = c = 1."

            "text": "Let us start by qualitatively reviewing how gravitational perturbations in gravity theories can be studied. In general, one assumes a linear perturbation of the metric as\ngab \u2243 gab + hab , (1)\nfor which the background metric gab and the perturbation metric hab satisfy the 0th order and 1st order equations of motion, respectively. They are obtained from the linear expansion of the full system of equations\nGab \u2243 Gab +Hab = 0 , (2)\nwhere Gab are the equations of motion of a given gravity theory. Let us assume that the background metric is given by some non-GR metric. We remark that we do not know a priori which equations of motion this metric is satisfying. However, as long as it is perturbatively close, with respect to some parameter \u03b4, to the Schwarzschild/Kerr metric, it must satisfy Einstein\u2019s equations of GR up to some error linear in \u03b4,\nG GR\nab [gcd] = 0 + O (\u03b4) . (3)\nThe presence of the O(\u03b4) term can be interpreted as the fact that the equations of motion of a new theory whose static solution is approximated by the metric gab must have different dynamics, not captured with the GR equations by a linear factor.\nWe can conjecture that the first order equations share the same property. For GR, one would have\nHGRab [ hcd; g Sch cd ] = 0 , (4)\nbut when gSchcd is substituted by gcd, the equations become\nHGRab [hcd; gcd] = 0 + O(\u03b4) . (5)\nOne must bear in mind that this notation generically includes the 0th and 1st order metric as well as their derivatives.\nar X\niv :2\n21 0.\n14 02\n0v 2\n[ gr\n-q c]\n2 O\nct 2\n02 3\n2 Let us now take into account a spherically symmetric background metric defined as follows\ngabdx adxb = \u2212f(r)A(r)dt2 + B\n2(r)\nf(r)A(r) dr2 + r2d\u2126 , (6)\nwith f(r) = 1 \u2212 rH/r, rH being the location of the event horizon. Then, we can expand the functions A and B with a set of real coefficients a(k)M , b (k) M in a postNewtonian fashion [17]\nA(r) = 1 + \u03b4 K\u2211 k=1 a (k) M ( rH r )k , (7)\nB(r) = 1 + \u03b4 K\u2211 k=1 b (k) M ( rH r )k . (8)\nWe make the series terminate at some finite number K starting from k = 1 to ensure asymptotic flatness.\nFrom the prescription suggested by passing from Eq. (4) to Eq. (5) one could guess the following form for the master perturbation equation\nfZ d\ndr\n( fZ d\u03a6\ndr\n) + [ \u03c92W \u2212 fZV \u2113 ] \u03a6 = 0 , (9)\nwhere one has enough generality to define the perturbation variable \u03a6 to choose Z = A/B such that the tortoise coordinate r\u2217 arising from this equation is dr\u2217 fA/B = dr. Finally, we expect small deviations from GR in the other parameters as well: W = 1 + \u03b4w(r), V \u2113 = V GR\n\u2113 (r) + \u03b4V \u2113(r). Note that in this definition we made explicit that radial functions modifying the potential depend on the angular momentum \u2113 of the quasinormal frequencies.\nIn the following we try to provide a heuristic explanation for why we expect this form for the master equation. The first step is to write down the master equation for a perturbation in GR\nFGR d\ndr\n( FGR d\u03a6\ndr\n) + [ \u03c92 \u2212 V GR ] \u03a6 = 0 , (10)\nwhere FGR \u2261 \u221a gSchtt g rr Sch = f(r) is the \u201cnatural\u201d tortoise function for the Schwarzschild solution, and\nV GR = gSchtt \u039b\nr2 +G(r) FGR r dFGR dr , (11)\nwhere \u039b = \u2113(\u2113 + 1), G(r) = 1 denotes scalar perturbations, G(r) = \u22123 for axial perturbations and\nG(r) = \u22123 1 + 3F 2 GR(r)\u2212 \u039b2[ 1\u2212 3FGR(r) + \u039b ]2 (12)\nfor polar perturbations. We intentionally wrote the eikonal term gSchtt \u039b/r2 to make its correspondence with geodesic motion evident.\nIf we assume that the background metric is the metric of Eq. (6), we can substitute all the gSchab terms with gab everywhere in equation (10). For example, one should transform FGR into fA/B. Moreover, to take into account that the theory can be different, one should add a correction \u03b4Z to the tortoise coordinate and one \u03b4V to the potential. These two corrections take into account the fact that the derivation of the perturbation equation might be done in a theory which is not GR [cf. Eq. (5)]. The resulting equation is\nf(Z + \u03b4Z) d\ndr\n[ f(Z + \u03b4Z) d\u03a6\ndr ] + [ \u03c92 \u2212 fZ ( V GR\u2113 + \u03b4V \u2113 )] \u03a6 = 0 .\n(13)\nOne can always re-define the perturbation function \u03a6 and re-scale the equation to remove the \u03b4Z term from the derivative term. This would ensure that the second order derivative is acted upon the tortoise coordinate of the metric. However, by doing so, one would introduce some terms multiplying the frequency, obtaining Eq. (9). The term multiplying the frequency can be mapped into the modification of the tortoise coordinate \u03b4w(r) = \u22122\u03b4Z(r), and we expand it as\n\u03b4w(r) = K\u2211 k=1 w(k) ( rH r )k . (14)\nIt is worth noting that this term appears because the background metric (and thus the tortoise coordinate) is different from the Schwarzschild metric.\nOn the potential side, from the construction, we can split the contribution to the potential coming from the metric and from the \u201cdynamics\u201d. We have that\nV GR \u2113 + \u03b4V \u2113 = V mod \u2113 + \u03b4V D \u2113 , (15)\nwhere we made the following identifications:\nV mod \u2113 = B \u2113(\u2113+ 1)\nr2 +\nG(r)\nr\nd\ndr\n( f A\nB\n) , (16)\n\u03b4V D \u2113 = \u03b4\nr2H K\u2211 k=0 \u03b2 (k) D,\u2113 ( rH r )k . (17)\nThis last term, linear in \u03b4, expresses in a 1/r basis our ignorance on the correct equations of motion for the dynamics of the theories under scrutiny.\nCollectively we label all the real coefficients, from metric and from dynamics as\n\u03b2(i) = ( \u03b2 (0) D,\u2113, z (1), b (1) M , w (1), \u03b2 (1) D,\u2113, z (2), b (2) M , w (2), \u03b2 (2) D,\u2113, . . . ) , (18) where we identified z(k) = a(k)M \u2212 b(k)M from the definition of Z. In the rest of the paper we will refer to this set of parameters as mixed parametrization or metric-potential parametrization to distinguish it from the potential-only\n3 parametrization introduced in [15]. A quadratic expansion of \u03c9 in the parameters \u03b2(i) is simply given by\n\u03c9 \u2243 \u03c90 + c(i)\u03b2(i) + 1\n2 v(ij)\u03b2\n(i)\u03b2(j) . (19)\nWe can infer the coefficients c(i) and v(ij) from the coefficients d(k) and e(ks) obtained in [15, 16]1 by comparing the respective master equations. In order to do so, we must manipulate Eq. (9). By performing the change of variables \u03d5 = \u221a Z\u03a6, the master equation takes the form\nf d\ndr\n[ f d\u03d5\ndr\n] + [ \u03c92\nWH Z2H \u2212 fV\n] \u03d5 = 0 , (20)\nV = V\nZ \u2212\nf ( Z \u2032 )2 \u2212 2Z (fZ \u2032)\u2032\n4Z2 \u2212 \u03c9\n2\nf\n( W\nZ2 \u2212 WH\nZ2H\n) ,\n(21)\nwith ZH = Z(rH) and WH = W (rH). In addition, the last term of (21) can be put in the 1/r form with the following manipulation:\n\u03c92\nf\n( W\nZ2 \u2212 WH\nZ2H\n) = \u03c92\n\u2211 k 2z(k) \u2212 w(k) rk\u22121 rk \u2212 rkH r \u2212 rH\n= \u03c92 \u2211 k ( 2z(k) \u2212 w(k) ) k\u22121\u2211 p=0 ( rH r )p . (22)\nIn this way, we can define a first order expansion of the potential in \u03b4 as\n\u03b4V \u2261 V \u2212 VGR = \u03b4\nr2H \u221e\u2211 k=0 \u03b1(k) ( rH r )k . (23)\nThe coefficients \u03b1(k) can be obtained up to second-order by combinations of the coefficients \u03b2(i). For generic index k and tensor axial perturbation, we have that linear contributions are\n\u03b1(k) = [ (k \u2212 2)z(k\u22122) \u2212 (k \u2212 3)z(k\u22123) ] k \u2212 7 2\n+ \u039b ( b (k\u22122) M \u2212 z(k\u22122) ) + \u03b2 (k) D,\u2113\n+ \u03c92r2H K\u2211 p=k+1 ( w(p) \u2212 2z(p) ) , (24)\nwhile we do not display the quadratic ones since the expression is lengthy and uninformative. The formula for scalar perturbations has an analogous form, while for the tensor polar case, one should first decompose the term (12) such that it yields 1/r terms. We suggest that the best-motivated way to proceed is to perform\n1 See also [18, 19] for alternative ways to compute these coefficients\nan eikonal expansion of the term (i.e., around \u2113 \u2192 \u221e) and include eikonal terms until the deviation in the coefficients is smaller than the numerical error of the coefficients themselves.\nThe manipulation shown with the previous calculations results in equation (20) being the same form as that in Ref. [15]. Now, one can apply the quadratic expansion of the quasi-normal frequencies from Refs. [15, 16] to Eq. (20), yielding\n\u03c9 \u2243 ZH W\n1/2 H\n( \u03c90 + d(k)\u03b1 (k)\n+ d(k)d(s)\u03b1 (k)\u2202\u03c9\u03b1 (s) + 1\n2 e(ks)\u03b1\n(k)\u03b1(s) ) .\n(25)\nDue to the relation between the coefficients \u03b1(k) and \u03b2(i), we can always do the mapping\nc(i) \u2261 \u2202\u03c9\n\u2202\u03b2(i) = \u03c90\n\u2202 \u2202\u03b2(i) ZH\nW 1/2 H\n+ d(k) \u2202\u03b1(k)\n\u2202\u03b2(i) , (26)\nv(ij) \u2261 \u22022\u03c9\n\u2202\u03b2(i)\u2202\u03b2(j) = \u03c90\n\u22022\n\u2202\u03b2(i)\u2202\u03b2(j) ZH\nW 1/2 H\n+ d(k)\n( \u2202\n\u2202\u03b2(i) ZH\nW 1/2 H\n\u2202\u03b1(k) \u2202\u03b2(j) + \u2202 \u2202\u03b2(j) ZH\nW 1/2 H\n\u2202\u03b1(k)\n\u2202\u03b2(i)\n)\n+ d(k)d(s)\n( \u2202\u03b1(k)\n\u2202\u03b2(i) \u22022\u03b1(s) \u2202\u03b2(j)\u2202\u03c9 + \u2202\u03b1(k) \u2202\u03b2(j) \u22022\u03b1(s) \u2202\u03b2(i)\u2202\u03c9\n)\n+ d(k) \u22022\u03b1(k)\n\u2202\u03b2(i)\u2202\u03b2(j) + e(ks)\n\u2202\u03b1(k) \u2202\u03b2(i) \u2202\u03b1(s) \u2202\u03b2(j) . (27)\nIt is worth noting that since all the coefficients \u03b2(i) are real, any term that would make the coefficients \u03b1(k) complex comes from the fact that the background metric is not Schwarzschild. Indeed, we note that the coefficients w(k) denote the deviation of the \u201cnatural\u201d tortoise coordinate of the master equation from the tortoise coordinate of the metric, nonetheless defined by the coefficients z(k).2\nThe advantage of this formulation over the potentialonly parametrization is evident when reconstructing the modified potential after the detection of more than one quasi-normal mode [19, 21, 22]. In fact, even at first it seems that the metric-potential formalism has more parameters than the potential-only one, one must be aware that the coefficients of the latter are complex (because they can depend on the frequency) and they are different for each mode measured, as they are sensitive to n and \u2113. This means twice as many K + 1 coefficients for each\n2 An additional frequency-dependent contribution not shown here could come from a non-spherically symmetric background metric, that reduces to Schwarzschild in the zero coupling limit (e.g., the slow-rotation expansion [20]).\n4 mode measured. On the other hand, the mixed formalism has K+1 coefficients \u03b2(k)D,\u2113 which change with the angular momentum of the mode, and K \u2212 1 coefficients z(k), b(k)M and w(k). None of them depends on the overtone number. By simple counting, one can find that the total number of coefficients for the observation of n\u2113 different angular momentum modes and nn additional (i.e., on top of the fundamental one) overtones for the potential-only case is 2(nn + n\u2113)(K + 1), while for the metric-potential case, one has n\u2113(K + 1) + 3(K \u2212 1).\nFormally the mapping to the metric can also be extended to cover the more general scenario of a coupled system of equations, as studied in Ref. [16], if one makes similar assumptions about how the fields are coupled to each other. Those key assumptions are that the additional coupling functions can be expressed in a similar expansion scheme as the potential in eq. (23) and that the additional fields couple linearly via the coupling functions. Such a structure of the coupled case has been explored in Ref. [16] for dynamical Chern-Simons, Horndeski gravity and an effective field theory approach."

(32)\nIn Fig. 1 we compare the application of the original parametrized framework with the new metric dependent one for the RN n = 0, 1, 2, \u2113 = 2 quasi-normal modes. In the two panels we show the relative error\n\u03b4\u03c9 = |\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9RN|/\u03c9RN between the parametrized quasinormal modes \u03c9 (potential-only parametrization is represented by solid lines while potential-metric parametrization by dashed lines) and the numerically computed one \u03c9RN. We check that from the scaling of the relative error, the deviation of RN QNMs from Schwarzschild QNMs is much larger than the error introduced by the parametrization, for the parameters considered. One can clearly see that the mixed parametrization gives an even more accurate prediction of the frequencies for each case considered. We also checked different angular momentum \u2113 which gives analogous features."

            "text": "Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) gravity is a well-studied alternative theory of gravity, where a dynamical scalar field is coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant through a coupling \u03b1GB. Our notation for the action of the theory and the equations of motion is consistent with that of Ref. [27]. Further information about the theory can be found in the latter, as well as in Ref. [28] and references therein. In the small-coupling limit, unless the coupling function does not have a linear term in the scalar field, all BHs in the theory develop a scalar\n5 profile around them, and the background metric and the perturbation equations are of the form we analysed here. The QNM spectrum of these solutions was computed in Ref. [29] without the small coupling expansion. The master equation for axial perturbation can be recast in the form of Eq. (9) retaining up to \u03b62 terms, where we introduced the dimensionless coupling \u03b6 = 4\u03b1GB/r2H. The relevant functions are (according to the notation of [27])\nB = 1\u2212 \u03b62 (\nr2H 8r2 + r3H 6r3 + 7r4H 16r4 + 2r5H 5r5 + 3r6H 8r6\n) , (33)\nZ = 1 + \u03b62 ( \u2212 49rH\n80r \u2212 39r\n2 H\n80r2 \u2212 97r\n3 H 240r3\n+ 49r4H 120r4 + 61r5H 120r5 + 7r6H 12r6\n) , (34)\nW = 1 + \u03b62 ( \u22122r 3 H\nr3 \u2212 r\n4 H\nr4 \u2212 r\n5 H\nr5 + 4r6H r6\n) , (35)\nV \u2113 = V GR \u2113 + \u03b6 2 rH r3\n[ \u2212 147\n80 + (6\u2212 \u039b)rH 8r\n+\n( 99\n4 \u2212 19\u039b 6 ) r2H r2 + ( \u221215\u039b 16 \u2212 29 4 ) r3H r3\n\u2212 9(\u039b\u2212 5)r 4 H\n10r4 +\n( 41\u039b\n8 \u2212 712 5 ) r5H r5 + 519r6H 4r6 ] . (36)\nAs shown in section II, one can transform the equation such that it is in the form suitable to express the modifications from GR as coefficients of the potential formalism. Hence, in Fig. 2, we compare the \u2113 = 2, 3 fundamental modes obtained with the two different formalisms against the fits of the numerical quasi-normal mode frequencies \u03c9GB computed in [29]. In this case, the metric-potential parametrization under-performs the potential-only one in most cases, even though the error with respect to the numerical fits are still comparable."

            "heading": "IV. CONCLUSIONS",
            "text": "In this work we have introduced a framework to compute quasi-normal modes from non-GR metrics where modifications are small. Our ansatz is very similar and can be mapped to the one proposed by Cardoso et al. [15]. This allows for a quick computation of QNMs of a given metric. We have found comparable precision among the two methods in approximating the numerically computed frequencies both for RN and EdGB axial perturbations. We showed how to perform the mapping between the two formalisms for scalar and tensor axial perturbations only, but we also provided an explanation on how to do it for the tensor polar case.\nThe main advantage of the mixed method is evident when one has in mind the so-called inverse problem,\nFIG. 2. Relative errors \u03b4\u03c9 = |\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9GB|/\u03c9GB for the real and imaginary parts of the axial n = 0 GB quasi-normal modes for \u2113 = 2, 3 using the potential-only parametrized framework (solid lines) and the metric-potential dependent one (dashed lines).\nwhich refers to the reconstruction of the perturbation equation in a theory-agnostic approach [19, 21, 22]. The essential condition for the inverse problem is the detection of more angular modes/overtones simultaneously, even if the capability of doing so with current observations resulted in an ongoing discussion in the literature [30\u201335]. The advantage in the inverse problem comes from a reduction of the number of parameters, all real, and only with the \u03b2(k)D,\u2113 depending on the angular momentum of the perturbation. This is not the case for the potential-only parametrization, for which all coefficients \u03b1(k) are, in principle, complex and depend on angular momentum and overtone number as well. Moreover, it can give insight into discerning whether a modification comes from the background or from the dynamics.\nThe possibility to explicitly separate the two contributions could also be useful when complementary constraints on the metric are provided, but not on the dynamics. Such a case may be possible with activities of the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration [36\u201338], which can, in principle, be used to study possible deviations from the Schwarzschild/Kerr metric of supermassive black holes, see e.g. Refs. [39\u201346] for some recent works. Other complementary constraints can also be obtained using x-ray spectroscopy; see, e.g., Refs. [47\u201349]. Although it seems unlikely that observations of the same\n6 objects can be done using gravitational waves and one of these techniques in the foreseeable future, one can still combine constraints on individual metrics under certain assumptions, e.g., assuming that the way the metric is modified is similar for all sources."
