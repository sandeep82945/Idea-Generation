    "abstractText": "In Part I of our sequence of 2 papers, we provide numerical evidence for a potential finite-time self-similar singularity of the 3D axisymmetric Euler equations with no swirl and with C\u03b1 initial vorticity for a large range of \u03b1. We employ an adaptive mesh method using a highly effective mesh to resolve the potential singularity sufficiently close to the potential blow-up time. Resolution study shows that our numerical method is at least second-order accurate. Scaling analysis and the dynamic rescaling formulation are presented to quantitatively study the scaling properties of the potential singularity. We demonstrate that this potential blow-up is stable with respect to the perturbation of initial data. Our study shows that the 3D Euler equations with our initial data develop finite-time blow-up when the H\u00f6lder exponent \u03b1 is smaller than some critical value \u03b1\u2217. By properly rescaling the initial data in the z-axis, this upper bound for potential blow-up \u03b1\u2217 can asymptotically approach 1/3. Compared with Elgindi\u2019s blow-up result in a similar setting [15], our potential blow-up scenario has a different H\u00f6lder continuity property in the initial data and the scaling properties of the two initial data are also quite different.",

Introduction. The three-dimensional (3D) incompressible Euler equations in fluid dynamics describe the motion of inviscid incompressible flows and are one of the most fundamental equations in fluid dynamics. Despite their wide range of applications, the question regarding the global regularity of the Euler equations has been widely recognized as a major open problem in partial differential equations (PDEs) and is closely related to the Millennium Prize Problem on the Navier-Stokes equations listed by the Clay Mathematics Institute [16]. In 2014, Luo and Hou [35, 36] considered the 3D axisyemmtric Euler equations with smooth initial data and boundary, and presented strong numerical evidences that they can develop potential finite time singularity. The presence of the boundary, the symmetry properties and the direction of the flow in the initial data collaborate with each other in the formation of a sustainable finite time singularity. Recently, Chen and Hou [6] provided a rigorous justification of the Luo-Hou blow-up scenario.\nIn 2021, Elgindi [15] showed that given appropriate C\u03b1 initial vorticity with \u03b1 > 0 sufficiently small, the 3D axisymmetric Euler equations with no swirl can develop finite-time singularity. In Elgindi\u2019s work, the initial data for the vorticity \u03c9 have C\u03b1 Ho\u0308lder continuity near r = 0 and z = 0. When \u03b1 is small enough, Elgindi approximated the 3D axisymmetric Euler equations by a fundamental model that develops a self-similar finite-time singularity. The blow-up result obtained in [15] has infinite energy. In a subsequent paper [13], the authors improved the result obtained in [15] to have finite energy blow-up.\nIn this work we study potential finite time singularity of the 3D axisymmetric Euler equations with no swirl and C\u03b1 initial vorticity for a large range of \u03b1. Define \u03c9 = \u2207 \u00d7 u as the vorticity vector, and then the 3D incompressible Euler equations\n\u2217Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA (hou@cms.caltech.edu). \u2020Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA (shumaoz@caltech.edu).\n1\nar X\niv :2\n21 2.\n11 91\n2v 1\n[ m\nat h.\nA P]\n2 2\nD ec\n2 02\n2\ncan be written in the vorticity stream function formulation:\n(1.1)\n\u03c9t + u \u00b7 \u2207\u03c9 = \u03c9 \u00b7 \u2207u, \u2212\u2207\u03c8 = \u03c9,\nu = \u2207\u00d7 \u03c8,\nwhere \u03c8 is the vector-valued stream function. Let us use x = (x1, x2, x3) to denote a point in R3, and let er, e\u03b8, ez be the unit vectors of the cylindrical coordinate system\ner = 1\nr (x1, x2, 0) , e\u03b8 =\n1 r (x2,\u2212x1, 0) , ez = (0, 0, 1) ,\nwhere r = \u221a x21 + x 2 2 and z = x3. We say a vector field v is axisymmetric if it admits the decomposition v = vr(r, z)er + v \u03b8(r, z)e\u03b8 + v z(r, z)ez,\nnamely, vr, v\u03b8 and vz are independent of the angular variable \u03b8. Denote by u\u03b8, \u03c9\u03b8, and \u03c8\u03b8 the angular velocity, vorticity and stream function, respectively. The axisymmetric condition can then simplify the 3D Euler equations (1.1) to [38]:\nu\u03b8t + u ru\u03b8r + u zu\u03b8z = \u2212 1\nr uru\u03b8,(1.2a)\n\u03c9\u03b8t + u r\u03c9\u03b8r + u z\u03c9\u03b8z = 2\nr u\u03b8u\u03b8z +\n1\nr ur\u03c9\u03b8,(1.2b)\n\u2212\u03c8\u03b8rr \u2212 \u03c8\u03b8zz \u2212 1\nr \u03c8\u03b8r +\n1\nr2 \u03c8\u03b8 = \u03c9\u03b8,(1.2c)\nur = \u2212\u03c8\u03b8z , uz = 1\nr \u03c8\u03b8 + \u03c8\u03b8r .(1.2d)\nIn the case of no swirl, i.e. u\u03b8 \u2261 0, the axisymmetric Euler equations are further simplified into:\n\u03c9\u03b8t + u r\u03c9\u03b8r + u z\u03c9\u03b8z = 1\nr ur\u03c9\u03b8,(1.3a)\n\u2212\u03c8\u03b8rr \u2212 \u03c8\u03b8zz \u2212 1\nr \u03c8\u03b8r +\n1\nr2 \u03c8\u03b8 = \u03c9\u03b8,(1.3b)\nur = \u2212\u03c8\u03b8z , uz = 1\nr \u03c8\u03b8 + \u03c8\u03b8r .(1.3c)\nWhen the initial condition for the angular vorticity \u03c9\u03b8 is smooth, it is well known that the 3D axisymmetric Euler equations with no swirl (1.3) will not develop finite-time blow-up [47]. Therefore, we consider (1.3) when the initial condition for the angular vorticity \u03c9\u03b8 is C\u03b1 Ho\u0308lder continuous for a large range of \u03b1. By using an effective adaptive mesh method, we will provide convincing numerical evidences that the 3D axisymmetric Euler equations with no swirl and C\u03b1 initial voriticity with 0 < \u03b1 < 1/3 develop potential finite-time self-similar blow-up.\nWe perform scaling analysis and use the dynamic rescaling formulation [21, 5, 8] to study the behavior of the potential self-similar blow-up. An operator splitting method is proposed to solve the dynamic rescaling formulation and the late time solution from the adaptive mesh method is used as our initial condition for the dynamic rescaling formulation. We observe rapid convergence to a steady state, which implies that this potential singularity is self-similar. We will demonstrate that this potential blow-up is\nstable with respect to the perturbation of initial data, suggesting that the underlying blow-up mechanism is generic and insensitive to the initial data. By introducing a parameter \u03b4 to control the stretching of the physical domain and the initial data in the z-axis, we find that the 3D Euler equations with C\u03b1 initial vorticity can develop potential finite-time blow-up when the Ho\u0308lder exponent \u03b1 is smaller than some \u03b1\u2217. This upper bound \u03b1\u2217 can asymptotically approach 1/3 as \u03b4 \u2192 0. This result supports Conjecture 8 of [13].\nWe choose the following C\u03b1 initial data for \u03c9\u03b8 with a stretching parameter \u03b4 > 0:\n\u03c9\u03b80 = \u221212000 r\u03b1\n( 1\u2212 r2 )18 sin(2\u03c0\u03b4z)\n1 + 12.5 cos2(\u03c0\u03b4z) .\nNote that the initial condition is a smooth and periodic function in z and is C\u03b1 in r. The velocity field u becomes C1,\u03b1 continuous. We further introduce the new variables:\n\u03c91(r, z) = 1\nr\u03b1 \u03c9\u03b8(r, z), \u03c81(r, z) =\n1\nr \u03c8\u03b8(r, z),(1.4)\nto remove the formal singularity in (1.3) near r = 0. In terms of the new variables (\u03c91, \u03c81), the 3D axisymmetric Euler equations with no swirl have the following equivalent form\n\u03c91,t + u r\u03c91,r + u z\u03c91,z = \u2212(1\u2212 \u03b1)\u03c81,z\u03c91,(1.5a)\n\u2212\u03c81,rr \u2212 \u03c81,zz \u2212 3\nr \u03c81,r = \u03c91r\n\u03b1\u22121,(1.5b)\nur = \u2212r\u03c81,z, uz = 2\u03c81 + r\u03c81,r.(1.5c)\nThe above reformulation is crucial for us to perform accurate numerical computation of the potential singular solution and allow us to push the computation sufficiently close to the singularity time.\nIt is important to note that the initial condition for the rescaled vorticity field \u03c91 is a smooth function of r and z. Using the above reformualtion enables us to resolve the potential singular solution sufficiently close to the potential singularity time. If we solve the original 3D Euler equations (1.3a)\u2013(1.3c), it is extremely difficult to resolve the Ho\u0308lder continuous vorticity even with an adaptive mesh, especially for small \u03b1. For this reason, we have not been able to compute the finite time singularity in Elgindi\u2019s work [15] since such a reformulation is not available for his initial data.\nCompared with Elgindi\u2019s blow-up result [15], our potential blow-up scenario has very different scaling properties. The scaling factor cl in our scenario increases with \u03b1 and tends to infinity as \u03b1 approaches \u03b1\u2217. In contrast, the scaling factor cl in Elgindi\u2019s scenario is 1/\u03b1, which decreases with \u03b1 and tends to infinity as \u03b1 approaches 0. Another difference is that Elgindi\u2019s initial vorticity is C\u03b1 in both \u03c1 = \u221a r2 + z2 and z, while our initial vorticity is C1,\u03b1 continuous in \u03c1, but smooth in z. There has been a number of theoretical analysis of the 3D Euler equations. The Beale-Kato-Majda (BKM) blow-up criterion [2, 17] gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the finite-time singularity for the smooth solutions of the 3D Euler\nequations at time T if and only if \u222b T 0 \u2016\u03c9(\u00b7, t)\u2016L\u221edt = +\u221e. In [10], Constantin, Fefferman and Majda asserted that there will be no finite-time blow-up if the velocity u is uniformly bounded and the direction of vorticity \u03be = \u03c9/|\u03c9| is sufficiently regular (Lipschitz continuous) in an O(1) domain containing the location of the maximum vorticity. Inspired by the work of [10], Deng-Hou-Yu developed a more localized non-blow-up criterion using a Lagrangian approach in [12].\nThere have been a number of numerical attempts in search of the potential finitetime blow-up. The finite-time blow-up in the numerical study was first reported by Grauer and Sideris [19] and Pumir and Siggia [41] for the 3D axisymmetric Euler equations. However, the later work of E and Shu [14] suggested that the finite-time blow-up in [19, 41] could be caused by numerical artifact. Kerr and his collaborators [24, 3] presented finite-time singularity formation in the Euler flows generated by a pair of perturbed anti-parallel vortex tubes. In [22], Hou and Li reproduced Kerr\u2019s computation using a similar initial condition with much higher resolutions and did not observe finite time blow-up. The maximum vorticity grows slightly slower than double exponential in time. Later on, Kerr confirmed in [25] that the solutions from [24] eventually converge to a super-exponential growth and are unlikely to lead to a finite-time singularity.\nIn [4, 45], Caflisch and his collaborators studied axisymmetric Euler flows with complex initial data and reported singularity formation in the complex plane. The review paper [18] lists a more comprehensive collection of interesting numerical results with more detailed discussions.\nDue to the lack of stable structure in the potentially singular solutions, the previously mentioned numerical results remain inconclusive. In [35, 36], Luo and Hou reported that the 3D axisymmetric Euler equations with a smooth initial condition developed a self-similar finite time blow-up in the meridian plane on the boundary of r = 1, see also [37]. The Hou-Luo blow-up scenario has generated a great deal of interests in both the mathematics and fluid dynamics communities, and inspired a number of subsequent developments [28, 27, 26, 9, 7, 5, 8, 6].\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly introduce the numerical method. We present the evidence of the potential self-similar blowup in Section 3, and provide the resolution study and scaling analysis. In Section 4 we use the dynamic rescaling method to provide further evidence of the potential blow-up for the case of \u03b1 = 0.1. In Section 5, we consider the potential finite-time blow-up in the general case of the Ho\u0308lder exponent \u03b1, and introduce the anisotropic scaling parameter \u03b4. The sensitivity of the potential blow-up to the initial data is considered in Section 6, and the comparison of our potential blow-up scenario with Elgindi\u2019s scenario in [15] is discussed in Section 7. Some concluding remarks are made in Section 8.\n2. Problem set up and numerical method. In this section, we give details about the setup of the problem, the initial data, the boundary conditions, and some basic properties of the equations, and our numerical method.\n2.1. Boundary conditions and symmetries. We consider (1.5) in a cylinder region Dcyl = {(r, z) : 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1} , We impose a periodic boundary condition in z with period 1:\n\u03c91(r, z) = \u03c91(r, z + 1), \u03c81(r, z) = \u03c81(r, z + 1).(2.1)\nIn addition, we enforce that (\u03c91, \u03c81) are odd in z at z = 0:\n\u03c91(r, z) = \u2212\u03c91(r,\u2212z), \u03c81(r, z) = \u2212\u03c81(r,\u2212z).(2.2)\nAnd this symmetry will be preserved dynamically by the 3D Euler equations. At r = 0, it is easy to see that ur(0, z) = 0, so there is no need for the boundary condition for \u03c91 at r = 0. Since \u03c8 \u03b8 = r\u03c81 will at least be C 2-continuous, according\nto [32, 33], \u03c8\u03b8 must be an odd function of r. Therefore, we impose the following pole condition for \u03c81\n\u03c81,r(0, z) = 0.(2.3)\nWe impose the no-flow boundary condition at the boundary r = 1:\n\u03c81(1, z) = 0.(2.4)\nThis implies that ur(1, z) = 0. So there is no need to introduce a boundary condition for \u03c91 at r = 1.\nDue to the periodicity and the odd symmetry along the z direction, the equations (1.3) only need to be solved on the half-periodic cylinder\nD = {(r, z) : 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1, 0 \u2264 z \u2264 1/2} .\nThe above boundary conditions of D show that there is no transport of the flow across its boundaries. Indeed, we have\nur = 0 on r = 0 or 1, and uz = 0 on z = 0 or 1/2.\nThus, the boundaries of D behave like \u201cimpermeable walls\u201d.\n2.2. Initial data. Inspired by the potential blow-up scenario in [20], we propose the following initial data for \u03c91 in D,\n\u03c9\u25e61 = \u221212000\n( 1\u2212 r2 )18 sin(2\u03c0z)\n1 + 12.5 cos2(\u03c0z) .(2.5)\nLater we will see in Section 6 that the self-similar singularity formation has some robustness to the choice of initial data. We solve the Poisson equation (1.5b) to get the initial value \u03c8\u25e61 of \u03c81.\nThe 3D profiles of (\u03c9\u25e61 , \u03c8 \u25e6 1) can be found in Figure 1. Since most parts of \u03c9 \u25e6 1 and \u03c8\u25e61 are negative, we negate them for better visual effect when generating figures. In Figure 2, we show the 3D profile and pseudocolor plot of the angular vorticity \u03c9\u03b8 at t = 0. We can see that there is a sharp drop to zero of \u2212\u03c9\u03b8 near r = 0, which is due to the Ho\u0308lder continuous of \u03c9\u03b8 at r = 0.\nWe plot the initial velocity field ur and uz in Figure 3. We can see that ur is primarily positive near z = 0 and negative near z = 1/2 when r is small, and uz is mainly negative when r is small. Such a pattern suggests a hyperbolic flow near (r, z) = (0, 0) as depicted in the heuristic diagram Figure 4, which will extend periodically in z.\n2.3. Self-similar solution. For nonlinear PDEs, people are particularly interested in studying self-similar blow-up solutions. A self-similar solution is when the local profile of the solution remains nearly unchanged in time after rescaling the spatial and the temporal variables of the physical solution. For example, for (1.5), the\nself-similar profile is the ansatz\n(2.6)\n\u03c91(x, t) \u2248 1\n(T \u2212 t)c\u03c9 \u2126\n( x\u2212 x0\n(T \u2212 t)cl\n) ,\n\u03c81(x, t) \u2248 1\n(T \u2212 t)c\u03c8 \u03a8\n( x\u2212 x0\n(T \u2212 t)cl\n) ,\nfor some parameters c\u03c9, c\u03c8, cl, x0 and T . Here T is considered as the blow-up time, and x0 is the location of the self-similar blow-up. The parameters c\u03c9, c\u03c8, cl are called scaling factors.\nIt is also important to notice that the 3D Euler equations (1.1) enjoy the following scaling invariant property: if (u, \u03c9, \u03c8) is a solution to (1.1), then (u\u03bb,\u03c4 , \u03c9\u03bb,\u03c4 , \u03c8\u03bb,\u03c4 ) is also a solution, where\nu\u03bb,\u03c4 (x, t) = \u03bb\n\u03c4 u\n( x\n\u03bb , t \u03c4\n) , \u03c9\u03bb,\u03c4 (x, t) = 1\n\u03c4 \u03c9\n( x\n\u03bb , t \u03c4\n) , \u03c8\u03bb,\u03c4 (x, t) = \u03bb2\n\u03c4 \u03c8\n( x\n\u03bb , t \u03c4\n) ,\nand \u03bb > 0, \u03c4 > 0 are two constant scaling factors. In the case of the axisymmetric 3D Euler equations with no swirl (1.5), the scaling invariant property can be equivalently translated to: if (\u03c91, \u03c81) is a solution of (1.5), then{\n1\n\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4 \u03c91\n( x\n\u03bb , t \u03c4\n) , \u03bb\n\u03c4 \u03c81\n( x\n\u03bb , t \u03c4\n)} (2.7)\nis also a solution. If we assume the existence of the self-similar solution (2.6), then the new solutions in (2.7) should also admit the same ansatz, regardless of the values of \u03bb and \u00b5. As a result, we must have\nc\u03c9 = 1 + \u03b1cl, c\u03c8 = 1\u2212 cl.(2.8)\nTherefore, the self-similar profile (2.7) of (1.5) only has one degree of freedom, for example cl, in the scaling factors. In fact, cl cannot be determined by straightforward dimensional analysis.\nAs a consequence of the ansatz (2.6) and the scaling relation (2.8), we have\n\u2016\u03c9\u03b8(x, t)\u2016L\u221e \u223c 1\nT \u2212 t , \u2016\u03c81,z(x, t)\u2016L\u221e \u223c\n1\nT \u2212 t ,(2.9)\nwhich should always hold true regardless of the value of cl.\n2.4. Numerical method. Although the initial data are very smooth, the solutions of Euler equations quickly become very singular and concentrate in a rapidly shrinking region. Therefore, we use the adaptive mesh method to resolve the singular profile of the solutions. A detailed description of the adaptive mesh method can be found in [21, 37, 48]. Here we briefly introduce the idea behind the adaptive mesh method. The specific parameter setting used for the experiments in this work can be found in the appendix of [48].\nThe Euler equations (1.5) are originally posted as an initial-boundary value problem on the computational domain (r, z) \u2208 [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1/2]. To capture the singular part of the solution, we introduce two variables (\u03c1, \u03b7) \u2208 [0, 1]\u00d7 [0, 1], and the maps\nr = r(\u03c1), z = z(\u03b7),\nwhere we assume these two maps and their derivatives are all analytically known. We update these two maps from time to time according to some criteria and construct these two maps as monotonically increasing functions. We will use these two maps to map the physical domain in (r, z) to a computational domain in (\u03c1, \u03b7), so that \u03c91(r(\u03c1), z(\u03b7)) and \u03c81(r(\u03c1), z(\u03b7)) as functions of (\u03c1, \u03b7) are relatively smooth. Let n\u03c1, n\u03b7 be the number of grid points along the r- and z- directions, respectively. And let h\u03c1 = 1/n\u03c1, h\u03b7 = 1/n\u03b7 be the mesh sizes along the r- and z- directions respectively. We place a uniform mesh on the computation domain of (\u03c1, \u03b7):\nM(\u03c1,\u03b7) = {(ih\u03c1, jh\u03b7) : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u03c1, 0 \u2264 j \u2264 n\u03b7} .\nThis is equivalent to covering the physical domain of (r, z) with the tensor-product mesh:\nM(r,z) = {(r(ih\u03c1), z(jh\u03b7)) : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u03c1, 0 \u2264 j \u2264 n\u03b7} .\nWith properly chosen maps of r = r(\u03c1) and z = z(\u03b7), the mesh M(r,z) can focus on the singular part of the solution, so that the accuracy of the numerical solution can be greatly improved.\nAs we will see in the following sections, the singular part of the solutions will gradually move towards the origin. Thus we dynamically update the maps to accommodate the movement of the focused region. The update of the maps is based on an adaptive strategy that quantitatively locates the singular part of the solution and then decides the necessity to change the maps, as well as the parameters for the new maps. Once we update the maps, we interpolate the solutions from the old mesh to the new mesh and use the new computational domain. In our algorithm, we adopt a second-order implementation for our adaptive mesh method. In Section 3.3, we will perform resolution study to confirm the order of accuracy of our numerical method.\n3. Numerical evidence for a potential self-similar singularity. In this section, we will focus on the case with Ho\u0308lder exponent \u03b1 = 0.1, and provide numerical evidences for the potential self-similar singularity observed from the 3D axisymmetric Euler equations with no swirl and with Ho\u0308lder continuous initial data. For the cases with different values of Ho\u0308lder exponent \u03b1, we will present the results in Section 5.\n3.1. Evidence for a potential singularity. On 1024\u00d71024 spatial resolution, we use the adaptive mesh method to solve (1.5) with Ho\u0308lder exponent \u03b1 = 0.1, until the time when the smallest adaptive mesh size gets close to the machine precision. The final time of the computation is at t = 1.6524635\u00d710\u22123, after more than 6.5\u00d7104 iterations in time.\nIn Figure 5, we plot the dynamic growth of several important quantities of the solution. The magnitude of \u03c91 has grown significantly, especially near the end of the computation. At the final time of the computation, \u2016\u03c91\u2016L\u221e has increased by a factor of around 5400, and \u2016\u03c9\u2016L\u221e has increased by a factor of more than 560. We also observe that the double logarithm curve of the maximum vorticity magnitude, log log \u2016\u03c9\u2016L\u221e , maintains a super-linear growth, and the time integral \u222b t 0 \u2016\u03c9(s)\u2016L\u221eds has rapid growth with strong growth inertia close to the stopping time. This provides strong evidence for a potential finite-time blow-up of the 3D Euler equations by the Beale-Kato-Majda blow-up criterion.\nIn Figure 6, we plot the 3D profiles of \u03c91, \u03c81, \u03c9 \u03b8, \u03c8\u03b8, ur, and uz at end of our computation. We can see that \u03c91 is very concentrated near the origin, and so is \u03c9 \u03b8. Therefore, we zoom-in around the origin and plot the local near field profiles of \u03c91, \u03c81, \u03c9 \u03b8, \u03c8\u03b8, ur, and uz in Figure 7. We observe that the \u201cpeak\u201d of \u2212\u03c91 locates at\nthe z-axis where r = 0, and is being pushed toward the origin as implied by the velocity field ur, uz. We denote by (R1(t), Z1(t)) the position at which |\u03c91| achieves its maximum at time t. We have R1(t) = 0. At (R1(t), Z1(t)), the radial velocity u r is zero, and the axial velocity uz is negative, which pushes (R1(t), Z1(t)) toward the origin.\nIn Figure 8, we plot the local velocity field near the maximum of \u2212\u03c9\u03b8 and \u2212\u03c91, respectively. We use the pseudocolor plots of \u2212\u03c9\u03b8 and \u2212\u03c91 as the background, respectively for the figure in the left and the right subplots, and mark the maximum of \u2212\u03c9\u03b8 or \u2212\u03c91 with the red dot. The velocity field demonstrates a clear hyperbolic\nstructure as depicted by Figure 4. And the velocity field clearly pushes the maximum (R1(t), Z1(t)) of \u2212\u03c91 toward the origin.\nIn Figure 9, we show the local streamlines near the maximum of \u2212\u03c9\u03b8 in R3. The maximum of \u2212\u03c9\u03b8 locates in the red ring centered at (0, Z1(t)) along the z-axis. In the left figure, we plot a set of streamlines that travel through the maximum ring from top to bottom. And in the right figure, we plot a set of streamlines that travel around the maximum ring from top to bottom. From Figure 9, we notice that the streamlines are axisymmetric, and do not form swirl around the z-axis.\nIn Figure 10, we show the curve of the maximum location of \u2212\u03c91, Z1 and the kinetic energy, E as functions of time. We can also see that Z1(t) monotonically decreases to zero with t. The curve of Z1(t) seems to be convex, especially in time windows close to the stopping time. We refer to Section 3.4 for more study of the behavior of Z1(t). The kinetic energy E, which is defined as\nE = 1\n2 \u222b D |u|2 dx = \u03c0 \u222b 1 0 \u222b 1/2 0 ( |ur|2 + |uz|2 ) rdrdz,\nfor our axisymmetric case with no swirl, is a conservative quantity of the 3D Euler equations. In Figure 10, we can see that there is little change of the kinetic energy E as a function of time t. In fact, the major reason for the change of E in our computation is due to the update of adaptive mesh, where we need to interpolate \u03c91 and \u03c81 from an old mesh to a new mesh. Since the new adaptive mesh will be more focusing on the near field around the origin, the far field velocity field might lose some accuracy, leading to a change in the kinetic energy E. However, such an update of adaptive mesh occurs only 35 times out of the total 65000 iterations in time, and the change in the kinetic energy E in each update is negligible. By the end of the computation, the change in the kinetic energy E is at most 1.4\u00d7 10\u22124 of the magnitude of E.\n3.2. Evidence for a potential self-similar blow-up. We observe a potential self-similar blow-up in our numerical solution. To check the self-similar property, we visualize the local profile of the rescaled \u03c91 near the origin. Recall that (0, Z1) is the maximum location of \u2212\u03c91, we define\n\u03c9\u03021(\u03be, \u03b6, t) = \u03c91 (Z1(t)\u03be, Z1(t)\u03b6, t) /\u2016\u03c91(t)\u2016L\u221e ,\nas the rescaled version of \u03c91. The above definition rescales the magnitude of |\u03c9\u03021| to 1, and rescales the maximum location of |\u03c9\u03021| to (\u03be, \u03b6) = (0, 1). We plot the profiles of \u2212\u03c9\u03021 near the origin at different time instants and the contours of \u2212\u03c9\u03021(\u03be, \u03b6) at\ndifferent times in Figure 11. The profile of \u2212\u03c9\u03021 seems to change slowly in the late time, indicating a potential self-similar structure of the blow-up profile near the origin. In other words, x0 = 0 in the self-similar ansatz (2.6).\nIn Figure 12, we plot the cross sections of \u2212\u03c9\u03021 at \u03be = 0 and \u03b6 = 1. The cross section at \u03be = 0 shows a good potential for a self-similar blow-up, while the cross section at \u03b6 = 1 shows that the blow-up profile has not converged to a self-similar profile yet. This is reasonable because although we are very close to the potential blow-up time, the strong collapsing along the z-direction and the effect of round-off errors prevent us from continuing the computation. We refer to Section 4 where we use the dynamic rescaling method and indeed observe numerically the convergence to the potential self-similar profile.\n3.3. Resolution study. We perform resolution study on the numerical solutions of (1.5) to confirm the accuracy of our numerical solutions. We first simulate the equations on spatial resolutions of 256k \u00d7 256k with k = 1, 2, . . . , 6. The highest resolution we used is 1536 \u00d7 1536. Next, for the numerical solution at resolution 256k \u00d7 256k, we compute its sup-norm relative error in several chosen quantities at selected time instants using the numerical solution at resolution 256(k+1)\u00d7256(k+1) as the reference, for k = 1, 2, . . . , 5. Finally, we use the relative error obtained above to estimate the convergence order of the numerical method.\nWe consider two types of quantities. The first type is the function of the solutions. Here we consider the magnitude of \u03c91, \u2016\u03c91\u2016L\u221e , the maximum norm of vorticity, \u2016\u03c9\u2016L\u221e , and the kinetic energy, E. We remark that \u2016\u03c91\u2016L\u221e and \u2016\u03c9\u2016L\u221e only depend on the local field near the origin, and E should be considered as a global quantity. The second type is the vector fields of \u03c91, \u03c81, u\nr, and uz that are actively participating in the simulated system (1.5).\nFor each quantity, we use qk to represent the estimate we get at resolution 256k\u00d7 256k. Then the sup-norm relative error ek is defined as\nek = \u2016qk \u2212 qk+1\u2016L\u221e/\u2016qk+1\u2016L\u221e .\nIf qk is a vector field, we first interpolate it to the reference resolution 256(k + 1) \u00d7 256(k + 1), and then compute the relative error as above. The convergence order of the error \u03b2k at this resolution can be estimated via\n\u03b2k = log ( ek\u22121 ek )/ log ( k k \u2212 1 ) .\nIn Figure 13, we plot the relative error of the quantities \u2016\u03c91\u2016L\u221e , \u2016\u03c9\u2016L\u221e and E for t \u2208 [ 0, 1.6\u00d7 10\u22123 ] , and the convergence order of the error in the late time\nt \u2208 [ 1\u00d7 10\u22123, 1.6\u00d7 10\u22123 ] . We observe a numerical convergence with order slightly higher than 2. The convergence order is quite stable in the time interval of our computation.\nIn Table 1, we list the relative error and convergence order of the vector fields at t = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22123. The convergence order stays well above 2, suggesting at least a second-order convergence for our numerical solver of the 3D Euler equations.\n3.4. Scaling analysis. In this section, we quantify the scaling property of the potential blow-up observed in our computation. This scaling analysis will give more supporting evidence that the potential blow-up satisfies the Beale-Kato-Majda blowup criterion. It also uncovers more properties of the potential blow-up.\nAs discussed in (2.6) of Section 2.3, if there is a self-similar blow-up, the scaling invariant property of the 3D Euler equations will ensure that \u2016\u03c9\u2016L\u221e \u223c 1/(T \u2212 t) and \u2016\u03c81,z\u2016L\u221e \u223c 1/(T \u2212 t). Therefore, we examine this property by regressing \u2016\u03c9\u2016\u22121L\u221e and \u2016\u03c81,z\u2016\u22121L\u221e again t, respectively. More specifically, for a quantity v, which is either \u2016\u03c9\u2016\u22121L\u221e or \u2016\u03c81,z\u2016 \u22121 L\u221e , we perform the least square fitting of the model\nv \u223c a \u00b7 (b\u2212 t),\nin searching for constants a and b, where a is the negated slope of the fitted line, and b can be considered as the estimate time of the blow-up. In Figure 14, we visualize the data points and the fitted line using data between t = 1.6500174 \u00d7 10\u22123 and t = 1.6520384\u00d7 10\u22123. The R2 of the fitting between \u2016\u03c9\u2016\u22121L\u221e and t is 1\u2212 1.28\u00d7 10\u22124, and the R2 of the fitting between \u2016\u03c81,z\u2016\u22121L\u221e and t is 1 \u2212 1.21 \u00d7 10\u22125. Such high R2 values show strong linear relation between \u2016\u03c9\u2016\u22121L\u221e , \u2016\u03c81,z\u2016 \u22121 L\u221e and t. Moreover, the fittings of the two quantities estimate the blow-up time to be b = 1.6529356 \u00d7 10\u22123 and b = 1.6529325 \u00d7 10\u22123 respectively. These two blow-up times agree with each other up to 6 digits. Therefore, Figure 14 provides further evidence that the 3D Euler equations develop a potential finite-time singularity.\nWe next move to fit the scaling factors cl and c\u03c9 used in the self-similar ansatz (2.6) of the solutions. Since the functions \u2126 and \u03a8 are time-independent in (2.6), we should have that\nZ1 \u223c (T \u2212 t)cl , \u2016\u03c91\u2016\u22121L\u221e \u223c (T \u2212 t) c\u03c9 ,\nwhere we recall that Z1 = Z1(t) is the z-coordinate of the maximum location of \u2212\u03c91. Due to the unknown powers cl and c\u03c9, the direct fitting of the above model is nonlinear. Therefore, we turn to a searching algorithm for the power variable. Specifically, for a quantity v, that is either Z1 or \u2016\u03c91\u2016\u22121L\u221e , we search for a power c\nsuch that the linear regression of\nv1/c \u223c a \u00b7 (b\u2212 t),\nhas the largest R2 value up to some error tolerance. We will start with a guessed window of the power c, and then exhaust the value of c within the window up to some error tolerance, and choose c with the largest R2 value. If the optimal c we searched falls on the boundary of the current window, we then adaptively adjust the window size and location, and repeat the above procedure. When the optimal searched c falls within the interior of the window, we stop the searching.\nIn Figure 15, we demonstrate the result of the searching. We can see that with the chosen c, the linear regression achieves a very high R2 value, suggesting a strong linear relation. The relative error between the estimated blow-up time and the previous estimate smaller than 7.8 \u00d7 10\u22125. Moreover, the searching suggests that cl \u2248 4.20 and c\u03c9 \u2248 1.41, and these estimated values of cl and c\u03c9 satisfy the scaling relation c\u03c9 = 1 + \u03b1cl in (2.8) approximately.\nIt is worth emphasizing that the estimated cl is well above 1, and this explains the convex curve of Z1(t) as observed in Figure 10 in Section 3.1.\nWe remark that we did not perform the searching algorithm with \u2016\u03c81\u2016L\u221e to find out the scaling factor c\u03c8, so that we could check the other scaling relation c\u03c8 = 1\u2212 cl in (2.8). This is because \u2016\u03c81\u2016L\u221e is mainly affected by the far field behavior of \u03c81, as shown in Figure 6. However, the self-similar ansatz (2.6) is only valid in the near field, so such fitting is meaningless. In fact, the good fitting between \u2016\u03c81,z\u2016\u22121L\u221e and t already implies that c\u03c8 = 1 \u2212 cl, because the self-similar ansatz suggests that \u2016\u03c81,z\u2016\u22121L\u221e \u223c (T \u2212 t)c\u03c8+cl .\nFinally, we perform the above fitting of different quantities using different spatial resolutions, and summarize the results in Table 2. We can see that the fitting has excellent quality at all spatial resolutions, and the fitted parameters are consistent across different spatial resolutions.\n4. The dynamic rescaling formulation. In order to better study the potential self-similar singularity as we have observed in Section 3.2, we add extra scaling terms to (1.5) and write\n\u03c9\u03031,\u03c4 + ( c\u0303l\u03be + u\u0303 \u03be ) \u03c9\u03031,\u03be + ( c\u0303l\u03b6 + u\u0303 \u03b6 ) \u03c9\u03031,\u03b6 = ( c\u03c9 \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b1)\u03c8\u03031,\u03b6 ) \u03c9\u03031,(4.1a)\n\u2212\u03c8\u03031,\u03be\u03be \u2212 \u03c8\u03031,\u03b6\u03b6 \u2212 3\n\u03be \u03c8\u03031,\u03be = \u03c9\u03031\u03be\n\u03b1\u22121,(4.1b)\nu\u0303\u03be = \u2212\u03be\u03c8\u03031,\u03b6 , u\u0303\u03b6 = 2\u03c8\u03031 + \u03be\u03c8\u03031,\u03be,(4.1c)\nwhere c\u0303l = c\u0303l(\u03c4), c\u0303\u03c9 = c\u0303\u03c9(\u03c4) are scalar functions of \u03c4 . In (4.1a), the terms c\u0303l\u03be\u2202\u03be and c\u0303l\u03b6\u2202\u03b6 stretch the solutions in space to maintain a finite support of the self-similar blowup solution. The term c\u0303\u03c9\u03c9\u03031 acts as a damping term to ensure that the magnitude of \u03c9\u03031 remains finite. The combined effect of these terms dynamically rescales the solution to capture the potential self-similar profile. Such dynamic rescaling strategy has widely been used in the study of singularity formation of nonlinear Schro\u0308dinger equations as in [39, 30, 31, 29, 40]. And recently it has been used to study singularity formation of the 3D Euler equations as in [21, 5, 8].\nIf we define\nc\u0303\u03c8(\u03c4) = c\u0303\u03c9(\u03c4) + (1 + \u03b1)c\u0303l(\u03c4),(4.2)\nwe can check that (4.1) admits the following solution\n(4.3) \u03c9\u03031(\u03be, \u03b6, \u03c4) = C\u0303\u03c9(\u03c4)\u03c91\n( C\u0303l(\u03c4)\u03be, C\u0303l(\u03c4)\u03b6, t(\u03c4) ) ,\n\u03c8\u03031(\u03be, \u03b6, \u03c4) = C\u0303\u03c8(\u03c4)\u03c81 ( C\u0303l(\u03c4)\u03be, C\u0303l(\u03c4)\u03b6, t(\u03c4) ) ,\nwhere (\u03c91, \u03c81) is the solution to (1.5), and\nC\u0303\u03c9(\u03c4) = exp (\u222b \u03c4 0 c\u0303\u03c9(s)ds ) , C\u0303\u03c8(\u03c4) = exp (\u222b \u03c4 0 c\u0303\u03c8(s)ds ) ,\nC\u0303l(\u03c4) = exp ( \u2212 \u222b \u03c4 0 c\u0303l(s)ds ) , t\u2032(\u03c4) = C\u0303\u03c8(\u03c4)C\u0303l(\u03c4) = C\u0303\u03c9(\u03c4)C\u0303 \u2212\u03b1 l (\u03c4).\nThe new equations (4.1) leave us with two degrees of freedom: we are free to choose {c\u0303l(\u03c4), c\u0303\u03c9(\u03c4)}. This allows us to impose the following normalization conditions\n\u03c9\u03031(0, 1, \u03c4) = \u22121, \u03c9\u03031,\u03b6(0, 1, \u03c4) = 0, for \u03c4 \u2265 0.(4.4)\nOne way to enforce the normalization conditions, as used in many literatures like [21, 34], is to first enforce them at \u03c4 = 0 using the scaling invariant relation (2.7), and then enforce their time derivatives to be zero\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c4 \u03c9\u03031(0, 1, \u03c4) = 0,\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c4 \u03c9\u03031,\u03b6(0, 1, \u03c4) = 0, for \u03c4 \u2265 0.(4.5)\nUsing (4.1a), the above conditions are equivalent to\n(4.6) c\u0303l(\u03c4) =\u2212 2\u03c8\u03031(0, 1, \u03c4)\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b1)\u03c8\u03031,\u03b6\u03b6(0, 1, \u03c4)\n\u03c9\u03031(0, 1, \u03c4)\n\u03c9\u03031,\u03b6\u03b6(0, 1, \u03c4) ,\nc\u0303\u03c9(\u03c4) =(1\u2212 \u03b1)\u03c8\u03031,\u03b6(0, 1, \u03c4).\nHowever, it is hard to evaluate (4.6) accurately, because it requires calculating secondorder derivatives. More importantly, due to the complicated nonlinear nature of (4.1a), even if (4.6) can be accurately evaluated, the temporal discretization (RungeKutta method) makes it difficult to enforce (4.4) exactly for the next time step. As a result, imposing (4.5) is not as helpful to preserve the normalization conditions (4.4) in the following time steps. The maximum magnitude and location will gradually change in time, which makes it difficult to compute the self-similar profile numerically.\n4.1. The operator splitting strategy. To enforce the normalization conditions (4.4) accurately at every time step, we utilize the operator splitting method and rewrite (4.1a) as\n\u03c9\u03031,\u03c4 = F (\u03c9\u03031) +G(\u03c9\u03031),(4.7)\nwhere F (\u03c9\u03031) = \u2212u\u0303\u03be\u03c9\u03031,\u03be\u2212 u\u0303\u03b6 \u03c9\u03031,\u03b6\u2212 (1\u2212\u03b1)\u03c8\u03031,\u03b6 \u03c9\u03031 contains the original terms in (1.5a), and G(\u03c9\u03031) = \u2212c\u0303l\u03be\u03c9\u03031,\u03be \u2212 c\u0303l\u03b6\u03c9\u03031,\u03b6 + c\u0303\u03c9\u03c9\u03031 is the linear part that controls the rescaling. Here we view \u03c8\u03031 as a function of \u03c9\u03031 through the Poisson equation (4.1b). The operator splitting method allows us to solve (4.1a) by solving \u03c9\u03031,\u03c4 = F (\u03c9\u03031) and \u03c9\u03031,\u03c4 = G(\u03c9\u03031) alternatively.\nWe can use the standard Runge-Kutta method to solve \u03c9\u03031,\u03c4 = F (\u03c9\u03031). As for \u03c9\u03031,\u03c4 = G(\u03c9\u03031), we notice that there is a closed form solution for the initial value problem\n\u03c9\u03031(\u03be, \u03b6, \u03c4) = C\u0303\u03c9(\u03c4)\u03c9\u03031 ( C\u0303l(\u03c4)\u03be, C\u0303l(\u03c4)\u03b6, 0 ) ,(4.8) where C\u0303\u03c9(\u03c4) = exp (\u222b \u03c4\n0 c\u0303\u03c9(s)ds\n) and C\u0303l(\u03c4) = exp ( \u2212 \u222b \u03c4 0 c\u0303l(s)ds ) .\nIn the first step, solving \u03c9\u03031,\u03c4 = F (\u03c9\u03031) will violate the normalization conditions (4.4). But we will correct this error in the second step by solving \u03c9\u03031,\u03c4 = G(\u03c9\u03031) with a smart choice of C\u0303l and C\u0303\u03c9 in (4.8). In other words, at every time step when we solve \u03c9\u03031,\u03c4 = G(\u03c9\u03031), we can exactly enforce (4.4) by properly choosing C\u0303l and C\u0303\u03c9 in (4.8). We could also adopt Strang\u2019s splitting [46] for better temporal accuracy.\n4.2. Numerical settings. Now we numerically solve the dynamic rescaling formulation (4.1). For the initial condition, we use the solution obtained from the final iteration of the adaptive mesh method in Section 3.1, and use the relation (2.7) to enforce the normalization conditions (4.5). Now that the maximum location of \u03c9\u03031 is pinned at (\u03be, \u03b6) = (0, 1), we focus on a large computational domain\nD\u2032 = { (\u03be, \u03b6) : 0 \u2264 \u03be \u2264 1\u00d7 105, 0 \u2264 \u03b6 \u2264 5\u00d7 104 } .\nThis choice of the computational domain implies that the dynamic rescaling formulation effectively solves the original equations in the domain (r, z) \u2208 [0, 100000Z1] \u00d7 [0, 50000Z1].\nWe adopt the boundary conditions and symmetry of (1.5) in Section 2.1, except the far field boundary conditions for \u03c8\u03031. Due to extra stretching terms, the far field\nboundary for \u03c8\u03031 will no longer correspond to the far field boundary for \u03c81, namely r = 1 and z = 1/2. However, we notice that \u03c81,r decays rapidly with respect to r, and \u03c81,z decays rapidly with respect to z. For example, Figure 16 shows the decay of \u03c81,r as r \u2192 1 and the decay of \u03c81,z as z \u2192 1/2 for the solution to (1.5) at t = 1.6524635 \u00d7 10\u22123. Therefore, it is reasonable to impose the zero Neumann boundary condition at the far field boundaries of D\u2032: \u03be = 100000 and \u03b6 = 50000. Due to the size of the computation domain D\u2032 and the presence of the vortex stretching terms, the error introduced by this boundary condition will have little influence on the near field around (\u03be, \u03b6) = (0, 1).\nWe remark that we still need the adaptive mesh in the r- and z-directions, because we not only need to cover a very large field, but also need to focus around (\u03be, \u03b6) = (0, 1). The adaptive mesh that we use to solve the dynamic rescaling formulation will not change during the computation, since the dynamically rescaled vorticity has its maximum location fixed at (\u03be, \u03b6) = (0, 1) for all times instead of traveling toward the origin.\n4.3. Convergence to the steady state. We solve (4.1) until it converges to a steady state. In Figure 17, we monitor how the normalization conditions (4.5) are enforced on the left. The two normalized quantities are essentially fixed at 1, and in fact, they deviate from 1 by less than 5.14 \u00d7 10\u22124. We view the system (4.1) as an ODE of \u03c9\u03031 as in (4.7), and plot the relative strength of the time derivative\n\u2016\u03c9\u03031,\u03c4\u2016L\u221e/\u2016\u03c9\u03031\u2016L\u221e = \u2016F (\u03c9\u03031) +G(\u03c9\u03031)\u2016L\u221e/\u2016\u03c9\u03031\u2016L\u221e ,\nas a function of time \u03c4 in the right subplot of Figure 17. This relative strength of the time derivative has a decreasing trend and drops below 8.18 \u00d7 10\u22126 near the end of the computation, which implies that we are very close to the steady state.\nWhen the solution of (4.1) converges to a steady state, \u03c9\u03031 and \u03c8\u03031 are independent of the time \u03c4 . Therefore, we should have the following relation from (4.3)\n\u03c91(r, z, t) \u223c C\u0303\u22121\u03c9 (\u03c4(t))\u03c9\u03031 ( C\u0303\u22121l (\u03c4(t))r, C\u0303 \u22121 l (\u03c4(t))z ) ,\n\u03c81(r, z, t) \u223c C\u0303\u22121\u03c8 (\u03c4(t))\u03c8\u03031 ( C\u0303\u22121l (\u03c4(t))r, C\u0303 \u22121 l (\u03c4(t))z ) ,\nwhere \u03c4 = \u03c4(t) is the rescaled time variable. Comparing the above relation with the ansatz stated in (2.6), we conclude that\ncl = \u2212 c\u0303l\nc\u0303\u03c9 + \u03b1c\u0303l , c\u03c9 = c\u0303\u03c9 c\u0303\u03c9 + \u03b1c\u0303l , c\u03c8 = c\u0303\u03c8 c\u0303\u03c9 + \u03b1c\u0303l .(4.9)\nWe remark that assuming (4.2), the above relation naturally guarantees that the scaling relation (2.8) holds true.\nIn Figure 18, we show the curves of scaling factors c\u0303l, c\u0303\u03c9 for the dynamic rescaling formulation (4.1) and cl, c\u03c9 for the self-similar ansatz (2.6). We observe a relatively fast convergence to the steady state as time increases. The converged values cl = 4.549 and c\u03c9 = 1.455 are close to the approximate values obtained in Section 3.4. Moreover, they also satisfy the relation (2.8).\nThe approximate steady states of \u03c9\u03031 and \u03c8\u03031 are plotted in Figure 19. We see that both \u03c9\u03031 and \u03c8\u03031 are relatively flat in \u03be, suggesting a possible 1D structure of their profiles. While both functions have weak dependence on \u03be, \u2212\u03c9\u03031 seems to tilt up around \u03be = 0 a little bit. The shape of the steady states looks similar to the shape of the profiles we obtained via the adaptive mesh at the stopping time in Figure 7."

            "text": "blow-up. Starting this section, we will no longer fix the Ho\u0308lder exponent \u03b1 = 0.1.\n5.1. The Ho\u0308lder exponent \u03b1. In his study of the finite-time blow-up of the axisymmetric Euler equations with no swirl and with Ho\u0308lder continuous initial data [15], Elgindi assumes that \u03b1 is very close to zero, smaller than 10\u221214. Such small value of \u03b1 is used to control the higher order terms of \u03b1 in Elgindi\u2019s proof. However, as stated in the Conjecture 8 of [13] by Drivas and Elgindi, such a blow-up may still hold for a range of \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1/3) for the 3D Euler equations. For \u03b1 > 1/3, it has been shown by [47, 43, 44, 42, 11, 1] that the solution will be globally regular.\nTherefore, we try different Ho\u0308lder exponent \u03b1 and explore the window of \u03b1 that admits potential finite-time blow-up. For each \u03b1, we first use the adaptive mesh method to solve the equations (1.5) close enough to its potential blow-up time, and then use the dynamic rescaling method (4.1) to continue the computation and capture the self-similar profile.\nFor our 3D Euler equations with initial data (2.5) with \u03b1 = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, we obtain strong evidence for the formation of self-similar singularity. The steady states of the solutions are plotted in Figure 20. We can see that as \u03b1 increases, \u03c9\u03031 will have weaker dependence on \u03be, and the self-similar profile becomes more and more one-dimensional. We plot the cross sections of the steady states of \u03c9\u03031 in Figure 21. As \u03b1 increases, \u2212\u03c9\u03031(\u03be, 1) becomes more and more flat, especially in the local window around \u03be = 0. Moreover, \u2212\u03c9\u03031(0, \u03b6) seems to be insensitive to the value of \u03b1.\nAs \u03b1 increases, cl increases rapidly. We can see from Figure 22 that, cl is more than 100 when \u03b1 = 0.3. Such large cl can cause a lot of troubles for our adaptive mesh method, as the collapsing speed of the solution is extremely fast. Fortunately, the dynamic rescaling method is stable with large cl, as the extra stretching term can control the rate of collapse. We list the values of cl for different \u03b1 in Table 3 in the next section.\nFor \u03b1 > 0.30, like \u03b1 = 0.31, 0.40, 0.50, we observe that although \u2016\u03c9\u0303\u2016L\u221e grows rapidly in the initial stage, it eventually slows down and starts to decrease, and the dynamic rescaling formulation fails to converge to a steady state. For example, in the case of \u03b1 = 0.31 shown in Figure 23, the double logarithm of \u2016\u03c9\u2016L\u221e becomes sublinear in the late stage, and \u2016\u03c9\u2016\u22121L\u221e seems to decay slowly to zero, which would violate the Beale-Kato-Majda blow-up criterion. While the value \u03b1 = 0.31 is still far from the critical case of \u03b1 = 1/3, we remark that this is due to our choice of the physical domain and initial data. In the next section we explore a class of initial data that would enable us to push the blow-up parameter region for \u03b1 much closer to the\ncritical value \u03b1 = 1/3.\n5.2. The anisotropic scaling parameter \u03b4. As the numerical results in Section 3.1 show, the initial data generate a hyperbolic flow around the origin as in Figure 4, where we observe a fast collapse of the solution along the z-direction. This strong collapsing force in z drives the solution to be singular in an extremely fast manner, which significantly limits our ability to push the computation sufficiently close to the potential singularity time. Therefore, we naturally ask if stretching the physical domain and the initial data in the z-direction would enhance the chance of producing a finite-time blow-up for a larger range of \u03b1.\nWe stretch the physical domain (r, z) \u2208 [0, 1]\u00d7 [ 0, 12 ] to [0, 1]\u00d7 [ 0, 12\u03b4 ] , and stretch the initial data \u03c9\u25e61(r, z) to \u03c9 \u25e6 1(r, \u03b4z). Here \u03b4 is the parameter controlling the stretch or squeeze. The case of \u03b4 = 1 corresponds to no stretch and \u03b4 < 1, \u03b4 > 1 correspond to stretch and squeeze, respectively. Instead of redefining the physical domain D and the initial data (2.5), we define the new variables\n\u03c9\u03021(r, z, t) = \u03c91(r, z/\u03b4, t/\u03b4), \u03c8\u03021(r, z, t) = \u03c81(r, z/\u03b4, t/\u03b4),(5.1)\nIn the following, we will slightly abuse the notations by still using the symbol \u03c91 and\n\u03c81 to represent \u03c9\u03021 and \u03c8\u03021. With the newly defined variables, (1.5) becomes\n\u03c91,t + u r\u03c91,r + u z\u03c91,z = \u2212(1\u2212 \u03b1)\u03c81,z\u03c91,(1.5a\u2019)\n\u2212\u03c81,rr \u2212 \u03b42\u03c81,zz \u2212 3\nr \u03c81,r = \u03c91r\n\u03b1\u22121,(1.5b\u2019)\nur = \u2212r\u03c81,z, uz = 2\u03c81 + r\u03c81,r.(1.5c\u2019)\nThe physical domain D and the initial data (2.5) remain unchanged. The only difference in (1.5\u2019) is that the Poisson equation (1.5b\u2019) has an additional coefficient \u03b42 in front of the z-derivative term \u03c81,zz. Similarly, the new dynamic rescaling formulation will be the same as (4.1), except that there is an extra coefficient \u03b42 in front of \u03c8\u03031,\u03b6\u03b6 in the Poisson equation (4.1b).\nWe solve the equations (1.5\u2019) with different values of \u03b4. In Figure 24, we plot the steady state profiles of \u2212\u03c9\u03031 with different \u03b4. In Figure 25, we plot the cross sections of the steady states of \u2212\u03c9\u03031 with different \u03b4. As \u03b4 decreases, the near field of the steady state profile tends to be closer to a 1D structure. The \u03be-cross section of \u2212\u03c9\u03031 at \u03b6 = 1 becomes remarkably flat for small values of \u03b4. And it seems that the \u03b6-cross section of \u2212\u03c9\u03031 at \u03be = 0 is insensitive to the value of \u03b4. We refer to [23] for more discussion on the limiting behavior of the steady state profile.\nIn Table 3, we list the converged values of cl for different values of \u03b1 and \u03b4. Some cells are left empty because we do not observe a potential finite-time blow-up for that particular pair of parameters. We can clearly see that cl monotonically increases with \u03b1 and \u03b4. When \u03b1 is approaching the critical cut-off value between blow-up and no blow-up, cl becomes extremely large.\nIn Figure 26, we plot 1/cl versus \u03b1. We see that 1/cl decreases with \u03b1 and seems to converge to zero as \u03b1 approaches \u03b1\u2217 < 1/3, which implies that cl \u2192 \u221e. Such a limit corresponds to some limiting behavior of the 3D Euler equations. The critical \u03b1 that makes cl infinity is smaller than 1/3, and increases as \u03b4 decreases to zero.\nFigure 26 also implies that by simply stretching physical domain and initial data,\ncontrolled by the parameter \u03b4, we can obtain a class of potential self-similar blow-up with a continuous range of scaling factor cl. In other words, there are infinitely many possible scaling factors cl for the potential self-similar blow-up of 3D axisymmetric Euler equations with no swirl.\nThe limiting case of \u03b4 \u2192 0 seems to be most interesting. Here in Figure 26 we draw the line of 1\u22123\u03b12 in green and dash as a reference. Firstly, we observe that as \u03b4 decreases, the curve of 1/cl becomes more linear with respect to \u03b1 and gets closer to the reference line. Indeed, at \u03b4 = 10\u22123, regression shows that 1/cl has an R\n2 of more than 1\u2212 6.68\u00d7 10\u22125 with \u03b1. We would like to point out that this regression is done with only 9 data points listed in Table 3. But we believe this is a strong implication that 1/cl is linear with \u03b1 as \u03b4 \u2192 0. We report the similar phenomenon for the n-D Euler equations in [23], where now the reference line has the form n\u22122\u2212n\u03b1n\u22121 .\nSecondly, let us denote by \u03b1\u2217 the critical value of \u03b1 such that 1/cl touches zero. Our numerical results seem to suggest that as \u03b4 \u2192 0, \u03b1\u2217 approaches 1/3. If this is true, it will provide strong evidence supporting Conjecture 8 of [13] that the 3D Euler equations with C\u03b1 initial vorticity with \u03b1 < 1/3 would develop finite-time blow-up.\n6. Sensitivity of the potential blow-up to initial data. We study the sensitivity of the potential self-similar blow-up to initial data. In addition to the initial data (2.5), we consider the following cases,\n(6.1)\n\u03c9\u25e6,11 = \u221212000 ( 1\u2212 r2 )18 sin(2\u03c0z),\n\u03c9\u25e6,21 = \u22126000 cos (\u03c0r\n2\n) sin(2\u03c0z) ( 2 + exp ( \u2212r2 sin2(\u03c0z) )) ,\n\u03c9\u25e6,31 = \u221212000\n( 1\u2212 r2 )18 sin(2\u03c0z)3\n1 + 12.5 sin2(\u03c0z) .\nWe show the profiles of these three initial data in Figure 27. In Case 1, \u03c9\u25e6,11 is a perturbation of \u03c9\u25e61 by setting the denominator to be 1. In Case 2, \u03c9 \u25e6,2 1 has a decay\nrate in r slower than ( 1\u2212 r2 )18 , and is no longer a tensor product of r and z. In Case 3, \u03c9\u25e6,31 has an improved regularity in \u03c1 near the origin. Indeed, we have, with \u03c91(r, z, 0) = \u03c9 \u25e6,3 1 (r, z),\n\u03c9\u03b8(r, z, 0) = r\u03b1\u03c9\u25e6,31 (r, z) \u223c r\u03b1z3 = \u03c13+\u03b1 cos\u03b1 \u03b8 sin 3 \u03b8.\nWhile for the original choice of the initial data (2.5), \u03c9\u03b8(r, z, 0) \u223c \u03c11+\u03b1 cos\u03b1 \u03b8 sin \u03b8. For all three cases, we only solve the 3D Euler equations with \u03b1 = 0.3 and \u03b4 = 1, due to the limited computational resources. As shown in Table 3, for our original initial data, cl = 112.8 is very large, which suggests that our choice of \u03b1 and \u03b4 is very\nclose to the borderline between the blow-up and non-blow-up. If the blow-up profile of the above initial data agrees with our original initial data well, we then have good confidence that they should have the same behavior for other settings of \u03b1 and \u03b4.\nWe solve the 3D Euler equations with the above initial data by first using the adaptive mesh method to get close enough to the potential blow-up time, and then using the dynamic rescaling method to capture the potential self-similar solution.\nFor the first and second cases, we show the fitting of 1/\u2016\u03c9\u2016L\u221e with time t in Figure 28, and the curve of the scaling factor cl in Figure 29. We can see that in both cases, \u2016\u03c9\u2016L\u221e scales like 1/(T \u2212 t), which implies a finite-time blow-up. Moreover, cl converges to 112.8, matching the value of cl we obtained using the original\ninitial data well. In Figure 30, we show the cross sections of the steady state of \u2212\u03c9\u03031 in comparison with the result obtained using the original initial data. There is no visible difference between the three steady states presented. In fact, even on the whole computational domain D\u2032 = { (\u03be, \u03b6) : 0 \u2264 \u03be \u2264 1\u00d7 105, 0 \u2264 \u03b6 \u2264 5\u00d7 104 } in the dynamic rescaling computation, the steady states in the first and second cases only differ by 7.03 \u00d7 10\u221210 and 5.29 \u00d7 10\u221210 respectively from the steady state using our original initial data \u03c9\u25e61 in the relative sup-norm.\nFor the third case, the fitting of 1/\u2016\u03c9\u2016L\u221e and the curve of the scaling factor cl is shown in Figure 31. We observe that 1/\u2016\u03c9\u2016L\u221e has a good linear fitting with time, suggesting a finite-time blow-up. However, cl converges to 19.44 which is clearly different from 112.8, suggesting that there might be a new blow-up mechanism. In Figure 32, we compare the steady states of \u03c9\u25e6,31 and \u03c9 \u25e6 1 in the 3D profiles and the 2D contours. The steady state of \u03c9\u25e6,31 has a slower change near z = 0. This might be caused by the smoothness of the initial data near z = 0. We have \u03c9\u25e6,31 \u223c r\u03b1z3, in\ncontrast to \u03c9\u25e61 \u223c r\u03b1z near (r, z) = (0, 0). The steady state of the third case develops a channel-like structure that is not parallel to either axis.\nThe new blow-up scenario in the third case provides some support of Conjecture 9 of [13], in which the authors conjectured that the 3D Euler equations could still develop a finite-time blow-up for initial data that are C\u221e in \u03c1. In our future study, we plan to investigate the potential blow-up using a class of initial data of the form\n\u03c9\u25e6,41 = \u221212000 ( 1\u2212 r2 )18 sin(2\u03c0z)2k+1,\nwith a positive integer k, so that \u03c9\u25e6,41 \u223c r\u03b1z2k+1 = \u03c12k+1+\u03b1 cos\u03b1 \u03b8 sin 2k+1 \u03b8 is C2k+1 in \u03c1.\n7. Comparison with Eligindi\u2019s singularity. In this section, we compare our blow-up scenario with the scenario in [15] studied by Elgindi.\nElgindi introduced a polar coordinate system on the (r, z)-plane to construct his blow-up solution. More specifically, he introduced\n\u03c1 = \u221a r2 + z2, \u03b8 = arctan (z r ) .\nThen for a Ho\u0308lder exponent \u03b1, he introduced a change of variable R = \u03c1\u03b1 and define the variables\n\u2126(R, \u03b8) = \u03c9\u03b8(r, z), \u03a8(R, \u03b8) = 1\n\u03c12 \u03c8\u03b8(r, z).\nIn this setting, (1.3) can be rewritten as\n\u2126t + (3\u03a8 + \u03b1R\u03a8R) \u2126\u03b8 \u2212 (\u03a8\u03b8 \u2212\u03a8 tan \u03b8) \u2126R = (2\u03a8 tan \u03b8 + \u03b1R\u03a8R tan \u03b8 + \u03a8\u03b8) \u2126, (7.1a)\n\u2212 \u03b12R2\u03a8RR \u2212 \u03b1(5 + \u03b1)R\u03a8R \u2212\u03a8\u03b8\u03b8 + (\u03a8 tan \u03b8)\u03b8 \u2212 6\u03a8 = \u2126. (7.1b)\nElgindi\u2019s analysis of (7.1b) establishes the following leading order approximation for small \u03b1\n\u03a8(R, \u03b8) = 1\n4\u03b1 sin(2\u03b8)L12(\u2126)(R) + lower order terms,(7.2)\nwhere\nL12(\u2126)(R) = \u222b \u221e R \u222b \u03c0 2 0 \u2126(s, \u03b8) K(\u03b8) s dsd\u03b8,\nwith K(\u03b8) = 3 sin \u03b8 cos2 \u03b8. If we plug in the approximation (7.2) to (7.1a), neglecting lower order terms of \u03b1, and (time) scaling out some constant factor, we arrive at Elgindi\u2019s fundamental model\n\u2126t = 1\n\u03b1 L12(\u2126)\u2126,(7.3)\nwhich admits self-similar finite-time blow-up. In his analysis, Elgindi chose the following self-similar solution of the fundamental model (7.3)\n\u2126(R, \u03b8, t) = c\n1\u2212 t F\n( R\n1\u2212 t\n)( sin \u03b8 cos2 \u03b8 )\u03b1/3 ,(7.4)\nwhere c > 0 is some fixed constant, and F (z) = 2z/(1 + z)2. One difference between our blow-up scenario and Engindi\u2019s blow-up scenario is how the scaling factor cl depends on \u03b1. We rewrite (7.4) as\n\u2126 = c\n1\u2212 t F\n( \u03c1\u03b1\n1\u2212 t\n)( r2z\n\u03c13\n)\u03b1/3 = c\n1\u2212 t F\n(( \u03c1\n(1\u2212 t)1/\u03b1\n)\u03b1)( r2/3z1/3\n\u03c1\n)\u03b1 .\nIf we let G(z) = F (z\u03b1), we see\n\u2126 = c\n1\u2212 t G\n( \u03c1\n(1\u2212 t)1/\u03b1\n)( r2/3z1/3\n\u03c1\n)\u03b1 .\nSince r2/3z1/3/\u03c1 is homogeneous, we may conclude that the scaling factors for the self-similar blow-up solution (7.4) are\ncl = 1/\u03b1, c\u03c9 = 2.\nNote that this also satisfies the relation c\u03c9 = 1 + \u03b1cl in (2.8). This implies that cl decreases as \u03b1 increases, and cl will tend to infinity as \u03b1\u2192 0. However, as shown in Figure 26, our cl increases as \u03b1 increases, and cl \u2192 +\u221e when \u03b1 tends to some \u03b1\u2217 below 1/3, and \u03b1\u2217 is approaching 1/3 as the parameter \u03b4 approaches zero.\nFurthermore, the regularity of our initial data as a function of \u03c1 is different from that of Elgindi\u2019s initial data. Around (r, z) = (0, 0), Elgindi\u2019s initial condition has the following leading order behavior\n\u2126 \u223c \u03c1\u03b1 ( sin \u03b8 cos2 \u03b8 )\u03b1/3 = r2\u03b1/3z\u03b1/3.\nHowever, our initial condition gives\n\u03c9\u03b8 = r\u03b1\u03c9\u25e61 \u223c r\u03b1z = \u03c11+\u03b1 cos\u03b1 \u03b8 sin \u03b8.\nThese two leading order scaling properties differ from each other in that \u2022 Elgindi\u2019s initial condition of \u03c9\u03b8 has a C\u03b1 Ho\u0308lder continuity in \u03c1, whereas ours\nis C1,\u03b1 in \u03c1, \u2022 Elgindi\u2019s initial condition of \u03c9\u03b8 has a Ho\u0308lder continuity near z = 0, whereas\nour initial condition is smooth in z. In Conjecture 8 of [13], the authors conjectured that the initial data could be C\u221e in \u03c1 for finite-time blow-up of the 3D axisymmetric Euler equations with no swirl. Our initial data slightly improves the regularity of the initial data in \u03c1. In [48], the second author has also explored the initial data with higher regularity in \u03c1.\nIn Lemma 4.33 of [13], the authors stated that the limiting equations at \u03b1 = 0 of (7.1), can blow up in finite time for initial data of \u2126 that only has a C\u03b1-Ho\u0308lder continuity near r = 0 for \u03b1 < 1/3. Our study shows that the blow-up of the axisymmetric Euler equations does not require to have Ho\u0308lder continuity of the initial vorticity along the z-direction. The essential driving force for the finite-time blow-up comes from the Ho\u0308lder continuity of the initial vorticity along the r-direction.\n8. Concluding remarks. In this paper, we have numerically studied the singularity formation in the axisymmetric Euler equations with no swirl when the initial condition for the angular vorticity is C\u03b1 Ho\u0308lder continuous. With carefully-chosen initial data and specially-designed adaptive mesh, we have solved the solution very close\nto the potential blow-up time, and obtained strong convincing numerical evidence for the singularity formation by numerically examining the Beale-Kato-Majda blow-up criterion. Scaling analysis and dynamic rescaling method have further suggested the potential self-similar blow-up. By introducing an isotropic scaling parameter \u03b4 that stretches the initial data and the Euler equations along the z-axis, we observed the potential self-similar blow-up in finite time when the Ho\u0308lder exponent \u03b1 is smaller than some \u03b1\u2217, and this upper bound \u03b1\u2217 can asymptotically approach 1/3 as \u03b4 goes to 0. Since when \u03b1 > 1/3, the axisymmetric Euler equations with no swirl admit global regularity [47, 43, 44, 42, 11, 1], this would potentially close gap between blow-up and non-blow-up, leaving only the critical case of \u03b1 = 1/3.\nThe potential blow-up observed in this paper is insensitive to the perturbation of initial data. And our initial study suggested that the regularity of the initial data around the origin would determine its scaling properties and the shape of the selfsimilar blow-up profile. Compared with Elgindi\u2019s blow-up result reported in [15], our potential blow-up scenario has very different scaling properties. The regularity properties of the initial condition of the two initial data are also quite different.\nIn our subsequent paper [23], we will further explore the potential singularity formation in the high-dimensional case of the Euler equations. We demonstrate that our settings of the boundary condition and initial data would consistently lead to potential singularity formation in high space dimensions. Moreover, we propose a possible mechanism, which implies the 3D axisymmetric Euler equations with no swirl would develop finite-time blow-up for a range for the Ho\u0308lder exponent \u03b1. Surprisingly, this range of \u03b1 matches well with our numerical results in different dimensions. We also propose a relatively simple 1D model and demonstrate that this one-dimensional model provides a very good approximation to the 3D Euler equations. This 1D model could play a role similar to the leading order system derived by Elgindi in [15] in the analysis of the finite time singularity of the 3D Euler equations.\nAcknowledgments.
