INTRODUCTION\nThe study of electric dipole moments and oscillator strengths is a major endeavor in electronic structure theory. The electric dipole moment is a vector that characterizes the intensity and the orientation of an electric dipole, and its direction and magnitude are dictated by the distribution of the electric charges. In a chemical system, it corresponds to the charge distribution of the electrons and nuclei and is consequently related to its electronic structure.\nFrom an experimental point of view, the dipole moment is a physical \u201csignature\u201d of a system in a given electronic state. Thus, it can be used to characterize unknown species or a specific isomer.1\u20133 In addition, the electric dipole moment is central in spectroscopy. For example, vibrational modes are\na)Electronic mail: yann.damour@irsamc.ups-tlse.fr b)Electronic mail: loos@irsamc.ups-tlse.fr\nsaid to be infrared-active if they are accompanied by a change in the electric dipole moment.4\nFrom a more theoretical point of view, combining dipole moment and potential energy surfaces allows us to model energies and intensities of vibrational-rotational transitions, and is then useful for rovibrational spectroscopy.5\u20137 Furthermore, because the dipole moment is intimately linked to the charge distribution of the system in a given state, it is closely related to its electronic density and wave function. Consequently, dipole moments are often considered descriptors of the quality of the electronic density for both ground and excited states.8,9\nAnother interesting physical quantity also classified as dipolar is the oscillator strength.10 Because the oscillator strength is linked to the transition probability between two states (i.e., the transition dipole moment), it tells us whether or not a transition is (electric-)dipole-allowed. Indeed, the magnitude of the oscillator strength is directly connected to the intensity of the peaks in ultraviolet-visible spectra.\nOne of the main goals in theoretical quantum chemistry is to describe accurately the electronic structure of chemical\nar X\niv :2\n21 1.\n04 12\n0v 2\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. ch\nem -p\nh] 2\n2 D\nec 2\n02 2\n2 systems by solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which gives access to experimentally measurable properties such as dipole moments and oscillator strengths. Unfortunately, an accurate description of the electronic structure requires one to approach satisfactorily the solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation through an appropriate and judicious set of approximations.11\u201313\nThe mean-field Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation11 is a relatively cheap method and is the starting point of correlated treatments in wave function methods. HF is known to produce reasonably accurate properties but breaks down when correlation effects become predominant. One textbook example is the ground-state dipole moment of CO which is predicted with the wrong orientation at the HF level.11,14 This disagreement disappears when one takes into account correlation effects. On the opposite side, the full configuration interaction (FCI) method provides the exact solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation within a given one-electron basis set, by constructing the wave function as a linear combination of all possible electronic configurations.15\u201319 All these configurations, which can be represented as Slater determinants, form the so-called Hilbert space that, unfortunately, grows exponentially fast with the system size, leading to a prohibitive computational cost for real-life molecules. Thankfully, between these two extremes, HF and FCI, a plethora of methods, some with systematic improvability, have been developed.\nTo reach FCI from HF, the most natural route is likely to increase systematically the maximum excitation degree of the configuration interaction (CI) wave function with respect to a reference configuration (usually taken as the HF groundstate determinant). This leads to excitation-based CI which has polynomial scaling but lacks size extensivity/consistency. By taking into account all single and double excitations, one gets CI with singles and doubles (CISD) with a computational cost scaling as O(N6) (where N is the number of one-electron basis functions), while adding the triples yields CI with singles, doubles, and triples (CISDT) scaling as O(N8), and so on. Alternatively, one can systematically increase the seniority number (i.e., the number of unpaired electrons) or the hierarchy parameter (average of the excitation degree and half the seniority number).20\u201322 Unfortunately, all these methods require considering a huge number of electronic configurations, most of them contributing very little to the energies and/or properties of interest.\nThis suggests the need for a selection of determinants based on an adequate predetermined criterion to capture effectively the electronic configurations contributing the most to a given quantity. The use of such criteria to build CI wave functions is the central idea of a general class of iterative methods known as selected CI (SCI), which sparsely explores the Hilbert space by selecting only the \u201cmost important\u201d determinants for a target property.23\u201328 In most of them, this iterative selection process is performed via an energetic perturbative criterion, and determinants with the largest contributions are added to the variational space.23\u201325,29\u201338 A second-order perturbative correction (PT2) is usually computed on top of this variational treatment.30,31,34,37,39\u201341 The resulting SCI+PT2 methods provide a much faster energy convergence with the size of the wave function than standard CI approaches.30,35,39,42\u201351 Impor-\ntantly, as a post-treatment, the SCI+PT2 energy and properties are usually extrapolated to the FCI limit using various strategies.42,46,52\nRelying on an exponential ansatz of the wave function, coupled cluster (CC) methods provide an alternative, sizeextensive, and systematically improvable route (with polynomial scaling) to the FCI limit.53\u201358 Following a similar philosophy as excitation-based CI, by adding successively higher excitation levels, one gets CC with singles and doubles (CCSD),59\u201363 CC with singles, doubles, and triples (CCSDT),64\u201367 CC with singles, doubles, triples, and quadruples (CCSDTQ),68\u201372 with respective computational cost scaling as O(N6), O(N8), and O(N10). Furthermore, each of these methods can be made cheaper without altering too much their accuracy via the CCn family of methods: CC2 (N5),73,74 CC3 (N7),75\u201379 and CC4 (N9).80\u201383\nExcited-state energies and properties can be straightforwardly obtained within the CI formalism by looking for higher roots of the CI matrix and their corresponding eigenvectors. Likewise, one can access excited states at the CC level in the equation-of-motion (EOM)62,66,84\u201388 or linear-response (LR)61,86,89\u201391 frameworks. Although they yield identical excitation energies, the excited-state properties produced by these two formalisms differ and are only equal when the FCI limit is reached.57 For the same excitation degree (hence the same computational scaling), the (non-variational) CC methods are generally more accurate than their (variational) CI counterparts for the computation of ground- and excited-state energies and properties, especially in the Franck-Condon region.71,72,80 This explains why high-order CC methods have now become the workhorse of electronic structure theory when one is looking for high accuracy. Nonetheless, their overall accuracy (with respect to FCI) remains very hard to assess, especially in the case of properties that are usually more sensitive than excitation energies to the level of theory and the one-electron basis set.9,92\u201395\nAnother feature that makes the calculation of electric (and magnetic) properties challenging is that there exist two different pathways for computing them which only become equivalent in the FCI limit but differ for approximate methods where the wave function is not fully variational with respect to all parameters.13,96,97 The first and most natural way consists in calculating the properties as expectation values of the corresponding operator associated with the physical observable of interest. The second approach, based on the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, requires the derivative of the energy with respect to a given external perturbation linked to the observable.96,98,99 Importantly, none of these formalisms can claim to be superior in general, although, in some cases, it has been observed that the derivative approach is likely more accurate.100 The energy derivative technique has been first developed by Pulay in the context of self-consistent field methods,98 followed by others in many-body perturbation theory,96,101\u2013104 CI,105\u2013113 and CC methods.71,114\u2013120 Recently, several groups have reported the implementation of nuclear gradients (i.e., energy derivatives with respect to the nuclear displacements) for SCI-SCF121\u2013123 and related124 methods. The expectation value route is usually more straightforward\n3 in terms of implementation but one must have access explicitly to the wave function and/or to the corresponding reduced density matrices, which is not always possible. For approximate wave functions, it has been observed that the derivative formalism is likely to lead to more accurate properties because additional contributions are taken into account.125,126 In this context, the Lagrangian formalism, developed by Helgaker and coworkers,97,127\u2013129 provides a rigorous mathematical framework to take into account the variation of the wave function parameters. For example, taking or not into account the response of the orbital coefficients to the external perturbation leads to the so-called \u201corbital-relaxed\u201d and \u201corbital-unrelaxed\u201d properties.130 The Lagrangian formalism is employed extensively in LR-CC where the relaxation of the ground-state CC amplitudes is considered, in contrast to the cheaper EOM-CC method, resulting in size-intensive transition properties.131\nUnfortunately, orbital relaxation effects may cause small discrepancies when employed within the frozen-core approximation since the orbital response depends on all the orbitals, even those that are frozen.132 Therefore, within the frozen core approximation, the orbital-relaxed and orbital-unrelaxed dipole moments can slightly differ even at the FCI level. This is typically the case when one considers small molecules with a significant number of frozen orbitals compared to the number of active ones.\nAnother degree of flexibility in the calculation of properties concerns the \u201cgauges\u201d or, more correctly, representations133 (length, velocity, or mixed) chosen to compute quantities like the oscillator strength, which are only equal for the exact wave function, i.e., at the FCI limit and in a complete basis set92,134 (or in the complete basis set limit for approximate methods135 which fulfill the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule136\u2013138). Accordingly, gauge invariance can be employed to evaluate the degree of completeness of the one-electron basis set.139\nThe present work reports ground- and excited-state dipole moments as well as oscillator strengths (computed in different representations) of FCI quality obtained with the SCI method known as Configuration Interaction using a Perturbative Selection made Iteratively (CIPSI)24 for a set of 11 small molecules extracted from the recent work of Chrayteh et al.140 Thanks to the high accuracy of the present results, we can systematically assess the overall accuracy of high-order CC methods for these properties and validate the quality of the theoretical best estimates (TBEs) reported in Ref. 140.\nAt this stage, it is worth mentioning that works on dipole moments at the SCI level have been previously reported in the literature. For example, the seminal work of Angeli and Cimiraglia reports a tailored selection procedure for dipole moments via a modification of the CIPSI algorithm.27 Although restricted to small wave functions, these authors achieved a significant speed-up of the convergence of the latter property and generalized it to other one-electron properties. On the other hand, Giner et al. studied the effect of self-consistency in the context of density-based basis-set corrections94,141\u2013143 on ground-state dipole moments using very accurate CIPSI calculations.9 Another study worth mentioning is the work of Eriksen and Gauss144 who reported (transition) dipole moments of LiH and MgO in large augmented basis sets using\nthe many-body expanded FCI method145\u2013148 which provides an interesting alternative to SCI methods.52 Other relevant studies have been performed using Monte Carlo CI149 or FCI quantum Monte Carlo.150\nAdditionally, benchmark studies of wave function and density-based methods have been reported for both dipole moments and oscillator strengths. For example, Hait et al. produced 200 benchmark values of ground-state dipole moments using CCSD(T) and basis set extrapolation to assess 88 popular or recently developed exchange-correlation functionals.151 More recently, Chrayteh et al.140 reported very accurate groundand excited-state dipole moments, in addition to oscillator strengths, using LR-CC up to quintuples and applying basis set extrapolation for a set of small molecules. In a follow-up paper, using these reference data, Sarkar et al. reported an extensive benchmark study of several single-reference wave function methods and time-dependent density-functional theory for several exchange-correlation functionals.93 The impact of the representations, the formalism (LR vs EOM), and the effect of orbital relaxation (relaxed vs unrelaxed) were carefully analyzed. Besides these three works focussed on very accurate values for small molecules, one can also find a large panel of benchmark studies devoted to larger compounds for which it is obviously harder to establish indisputable reference values.130,152\u2013170\nThe present manuscript is organized as follows. Section II recalls the working equations of the CIPSI algorithm and how one computes dipole moments and oscillator strengths at the SCI level. Section III reports our computational details, while, in Sec. IV, we discuss the present results and explain in detail how we reach the FCI limit via tailored extrapolation procedures. Our conclusions are drawn in Sec. V. Unless otherwise stated, atomic units are used throughout."

The SCI oscillator strengths have been computed in the length, velocity, and mixed representations, while their CC counterparts are only available in the length representation. All the SCI+PT2 calculations have been performed with quantum package,37 where the CIPSI algorithm (see Sec.

            "text": "As discussed above, in the CIPSI method, the wave function is built iteratively. At each iteration, the determinants with the largest contributions to the second-order perturbative energy, |ePT2\u03b1 | , are added to the variational space (see Fig. 1). In practice, we double the size of the variational space at each iteration and include the additional determinants required to obtain eigenstates of the S\u0302 2 spin operator.180 As a consequence of this growth, the variational energy decreases as the number of iterations increases. This is, of course, not strictly true for properties that are not directly linked to the variational principle. However, even if there is no direct relationship between the quality of the variational energy and a given property, the important determinants for the description of this property will eventually enter the variational space as it grows. Consequently, although it is possible to directly select determinants for a given property as shown by Angeli and coworkers,181 the determinant selection based on an energy criterion is, in practice, a reasonable and universal way of producing accurate properties at the SCI level.\nTo illustrate these points, we report in the left panel of Fig. 3 the evolution of the ground-state variational energy Evar0 and the norm of the ground-state dipole moment \u2016\u00b50\u2016 as functions of the number of determinants in the variational space for the BF molecule computed in the aug-cc-pVDZ basis. As one\n6\ncan see, while Evar0 decreases monotonically towards the FCI limit (blue curve), the convergence of \u2016\u00b50\u2016 (red curve) is more erratic but \u2016\u00b50\u2016 eventually stabilizes for large enough wave functions and converges smoothly to its FCI limiting value.\nTo have a closer look at the region where one performs the extrapolation, we have plotted in the right panel of Fig. 3 the evolution of the same quantities (for the same system) as functions of the second-order perturbative energy E(2)0 . As empirically observed, the behavior of Evar0 for small E PT2 0 is linear as expected from basic perturbative arguments (see blue curve in Fig. 3). One can therefore safely extrapolate Evar0 to EPT20 = 0 using the largest variational wave functions (or equivalently the smallest EPT20 values) using a first- or secondorder polynomial in EPT20 to estimate the FCI energy. A similar observation holds for the dipole moment (red curve) but the corresponding curve shows a significant quadratic character and the asymptotic regime usually appears for larger wave functions (see below). Nonetheless, we employ the same procedure as for the energy and estimate the FCI value of the dipole moment using a quadratic fit in EPT20 based on the four largest variational wave functions. A rough error estimate is provided by the largest difference in extrapolated values between this 4-point fit and its 3- and 5-point counterparts.\nThis procedure is performed independently for each electronic state in the case of the energy and the dipole moment.\nFor the oscillator strength that is naturally related to the ground and the target excited state, the extrapolation procedure involves a second-order polynomial in the averaged second-order perturbative energies (EPT20 + E PT2 k )/2.\nIllustrative examples for dipole moments are reported in Fig. 4 and the corresponding numerical values are gathered in Table II. The left panel of Fig. 4 shows a well-behaved case where the data are fitted quite well by a quadratic polynomial and the extrapolated value is fairly independent of the number of points. The right panel shows an ill-behaved case where our procedure can hardly model the evolution of the dipole moment and the error is of the order of 0.01 D. Problematic\ncases are hard to detect a priori and depend on the selected system, state, and basis set.\nFigure 5 reports the oscillator strength between the ground and first excited states of H2S computed with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set, in the length, velocity, and mixed representations. In the case of oscillator strengths, we also rely on quadratic fits to estimate the FCI limiting values and the corresponding fitting errors. The different limiting values reached with the three representations are clearly visible on the left panel. We underline that these differences remain fairly small (below 10\u22123 in this particular case). The right panel shows the extrapolation (with different numbers of points) of f L1 as a function of (E PT2 0 + EPT21 )/2."

            "text": "Our goal is to gauge the quality of the (orbital-relaxed) dipole moments obtained at various LR-CC levels for our set of 11 molecules, by comparing them to our near-FCI estimates. The box plot representations of the error in ground- and excitedstate dipole moments computed at the CCSD (blue), CCSDT (red), and CCSDTQ (green) levels for all basis sets listed in the supporting information are represented in Fig. 6. The corresponding statistical quantities are reported in Table III. We decided not to report any trends on CCSDTQP as the error between the latter method and exFCI is of the same order of magnitude as the extrapolation errors.\nConsidering both the ground- and excited-state dipoles, the\nusual trend of systematic improvement is nicely illustrated with the MAEs going down from 4.5 \u00d7 10\u22122 D for CCSD to 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22123 D for CCSDTQ. The inclusion of triples already provides an accuracy below 10\u22122 D (MAE of 9.1 \u00d7 10\u22123 D for CCSDT), which would be classified as very accurate for most applications. In other words, going from one excitation degree to the next one (from CCSD to CCSDT or from CCSDT to CCSDTQ) reduces most of the statistical indicators by approximately one order of magnitude. The MSEs are positive for both ground and excited states, meaning that the magnitudes of the dipole moments tend to be overestimated by LR-CC, at least for the present set of compounds. In addition, the largest errors are generally positive and obtained for the excited-state\ndipoles. An analysis of the other statistical quantities leads to similar conclusions. As one notices by comparing the central and right panels of Fig. 6, CC methods are more accurate for ground-state dipole moments than for excited-state ones, which is expected since the LR (as well as EOM) formalism is naturally biased towards the ground state.\nThe exFCI/aug-cc-pVTZ values can also be compared to the orbital-relaxed TBEs obtained by Chrayteh et al.140 for the dipole moments computed in the same basis. The differences between these two sets of accurate data are reported in Fig. 7 (see Table I for the raw data). Small differences are observed for BH and BF between the orbital-relaxed and orbital-unrelaxed dipole moments of the first excited state due\n9\nto the frozen core approximation (see Sec. I).132 For formaldehyde, fluorocarbene, and silylidene, the convergence of the CIPSI calculations for the different states is not completely satisfactory, leading to larger uncertainties on the exFCI values, hence explaining the difference with the TBEs. Excluding these cases, the TBEs are found to be in excellent agreement with the exFCI results with differences of few mD only."

            "text": "Let us now focus on the performance of CC methods for oscillator strengths by comparing them to exFCI. The corresponding statistical analysis considering length representation (for all basis sets listed in the supporting information) can be found in Table IV. The box plots of the errors associated with CCSD, CCSDT, and CCSDTQ are represented in Fig. 8.\nConcerning the statistics, the results gathered in Table IV show that the MSEs of the different CC methods are close to zero, sometimes positive and sometimes negative, meaning that one cannot conclude if the oscillator strengths tend to be overestimated or underestimated. Also, similarly to the dipole moments, going from one excitation degree to the next one reduces the error and all the statistical quantities by approximately one order of magnitude (see Fig. 8). Overall, we have found that the oscillator strengths are easier to converge at the SCI level than the individual dipole moments. We note that CCSDT provides a MAE well below 10\u22123, which is sufficient for most applications.\nTable I reports the oscillator strengths at the exFCI/aug-ccpVTZ level in the different representations for the 9 dipoleallowed transitions considered in the present study. The corresponding TBEs extracted from the work of Chrayteh et al.140 and computed in the length representation are also listed for comparison purposes. As one would see, there is a perfect agreement between the two sets of data, which confirms the quality of the TBEs reported in Ref. 140. In Table I, we also report the oscillator strengths computed in the velocity and mixed representations. Except for a few valence transitions, they do not significantly differ from their length counterparts. In each case, f LV can be fairly well approximated by the aver-\naged value of f L and f V, as expected from their mathematical definitions (see Sec. II B)."

            "heading": "V. CONCLUDING REMARKS",
            "text": "In this work, we have implemented the computation of the ground- and excited-state dipole moments, as well as the oscillator strengths, at the SCI level using the expectation value formalism. Thanks to an efficient implementation of the SCI+PT2 method known as CIPSI and tailored extrapolation procedures, we have been able to reach near-FCI accuracy for these properties in the case of 11 small molecules. In most cases, the magnitude of the dipole moments was computed with an accuracy of few mD. Similarly, we have reached an accuracy of the order of 10\u22124 for the oscillator strengths in the length, velocity, and mixed representations. Of course, the accuracy is constrained by the size of the Hilbert space, and reaching such a level of precision is hence limited to compact systems. Nevertheless, the principal ambitions of the present work are (i) to illustrate how one can reach near-FCI quality for electronic properties with SCI+PT2 methods, and (ii) how they can be useful to estimate errors in state-of-the-art CC models which are usually challenging to assess due to the lack of reference data. The main highlights of the present benchmark are that CCSDT is accurate enough for most practical applications, while CCSD produces MAEs of 3.8 \u00d7 10\u22122 D (5.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 D) and 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 for ground-state (excited-state) dipole moments and oscillator strengths, respectively.\nAs a perspective, the present strategy could be further improved by taking into account the (perturbative) first-order wave function in the computation of the expectation values. This would be particularly useful to tackle larger systems. Work along these lines is currently in progress in our group.\nSUPPORTING INFORMATION\nSee the supporting information for the raw data associated with each figure and table, the molecular geometries, and the Hartree-Fock energies corresponding to the different basis\n10\nTABLE IV.
