1. **Investigate the use of active learning to reduce the amount of training data required.** Active learning is a technique that allows models to learn more efficiently by selecting the most informative data points to label. This could be used to reduce the amount of training data required for Kepler, making it more practical for use in production systems.
2. **Explore the use of transfer learning to improve the performance of Kepler on new query templates.** Transfer learning is a technique that allows models to learn from data in one domain and then apply that knowledge to a new domain. This could be used to improve the performance of Kepler on new query templates, even if there is limited training data available.
3. **Develop new methods for generating candidate plans.** RCE is a powerful candidate generation algorithm, but there may be other methods that can generate even better plans. For example, one could explore the use of genetic algorithms or reinforcement learning to generate candidate plans.
4. **Investigate the use of different machine learning models for best-plan prediction.** Kepler uses a simple feedforward neural network for best-plan prediction, but there may be other models that can achieve better performance. For example, one could explore the use of recurrent neural networks or graph neural networks.
5. **Extend Kepler to support other types of queries.** Kepler is currently only designed to support parameterized queries. However, it could be extended to support other types of queries, such as ad-hoc queries or OLAP queries.
