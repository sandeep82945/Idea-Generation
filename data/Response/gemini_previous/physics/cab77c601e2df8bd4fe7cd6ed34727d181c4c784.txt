1. **Investigate the effect of different pH values on the performance of the A. neopropionicum–C. kluyveri co-culture.** The study found that increasing the pH from 7 to 7.3 boosted ethanol consumption and chain-elongating activity of C5–C7 carboxylates. Further research could explore a wider range of pH values to determine the optimal pH for the co-culture and to investigate the underlying mechanisms responsible for the observed pH effects.


2. **Explore the use of in-line product extraction to enhance the production rates of OCCAs.** The study found that the production rates of OCCAs were relatively low compared to those reported in other studies. In-line product extraction has been shown to significantly enhance production rates by reducing product inhibition. Future research could investigate the implementation of in-line product extraction in the A. neopropionicum–C. kluyveri co-culture to determine if it can improve the production rates of OCCAs.


3. **Investigate the use of biomass retention to further improve the production rates of OCCAs.** Biomass retention has also been demonstrated to improve production rates. Future research could investigate the use of biomass retention, either via anaerobic filter reactors or membrane modules, in the A. neopropionicum–C. kluyveri co-culture to determine if it can further improve the production rates of OCCAs.


4. **Study the metabolic pathways involved in odd-chain elongation in C. kluyveri.** The study found that C. kluyveri performed excessive ethanol oxidation during odd-chain elongation, which resulted in a shift towards even-chain products. Further research could investigate the metabolic pathways involved in odd-chain elongation in C. kluyveri to determine the mechanisms responsible for excessive ethanol oxidation and to identify potential strategies to minimize it.


5. **Develop a multi-species genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) of the A. neopropionicum–C. kluyveri co-culture.** A multi-species GEM could be used to predict the phenotypes of the co-culture and to find strategies to optimize process performance. The GEM could be constructed using the existing GEM of A. neopropionicum and the GEM of the Clostridium autoethanogenum–C. kluyveri co-culture. The multi-species GEM could then be used to investigate the effects of different operating conditions, such as pH, substrate concentrations, and dilution rate, on the production of OCCAs.
