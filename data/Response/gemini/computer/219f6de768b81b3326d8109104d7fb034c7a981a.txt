1. **Investigate the use of different group convolution strategies:** The paper uses a simple strategy of maximizing the group number to reduce computational complexity. However, there may be more sophisticated strategies that can further reduce complexity while maintaining or even improving accuracy. For example, one could explore using different group numbers for different layers or using adaptive group convolution, where the group number is dynamically adjusted based on the input data.


2. **Explore the use of different feature fusion techniques:** The paper uses a simple linear fusion layer to combine the features from different groups. However, there may be more powerful fusion techniques that can further improve accuracy. For example, one could explore using attention mechanisms or graph neural networks to fuse the features.


3. **Investigate the use of different auxiliary classifier architectures:** The paper uses a simple fully connected layer as the auxiliary classifier. However, there may be more sophisticated architectures that can further improve accuracy. For example, one could explore using convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks as the auxiliary classifiers.


4. **Apply the proposed method to other HRRP recognition tasks:** The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on a specific HRRP recognition task. However, it is possible that the method can also be applied to other HRRP recognition tasks, such as target classification or tracking. It would be interesting to investigate the performance of the method on these other tasks.


5. **Explore the use of the proposed method for other radar applications:** The paper focuses on the application of the proposed method to HRRP recognition. However, it is possible that the method can also be applied to other radar applications, such as target detection or tracking. It would be interesting to investigate the performance of the method on these other applications.
