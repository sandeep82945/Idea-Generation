"Our outcomes for the ACH hospital at home model were very encouraging. We found that 30-day mortality rates were quite low (0.58%) and we had no patients pass away while enrolled in the ACH program despite the mean severity of illness score of 2.9 across both sites. It should be noted that the low mortality rate both in the program and 30-days following the program could be attributed to the careful patient selection along both clinical and social parameters to ensure the patient would be safe at home and was stable enough to warrant receiving care at home. Interestingly, 80% of patients that participated in the acute phase of care chose to continue into the restorative phase of care. This optional phase of care was offered to patients as a mechanism to continue to stay connected to them and assist the patient using the supplier network of resources in the community in the event the patient began to decompensate. We suspect this high proportion of patients that chose to participate in the restorative phase could be reflective of patientsâ€™ desire to have an ongoing connection to their healthcare team along their healthcare journey. Compared to a reported 30-day mortality rate of traditional hospitalized patients discharged home with home health of 2.3% [20], our model shows promise of being at least as safe, and may even show the mortality reduction like previous traditional hospital-at-home programs [5, 21]. We also found that our readmission rates remain considerably low when compared to national averages [22]. This lower readmission rate could be attributed to our ability to escalate care in the home during the restorative phase of care, reducing the need to have the patient return to an emergency department. However, this could also be a direct reflection of the strict patient selection process, including the clinical and social stability screenings, that specifically look for acute but stable patients that will be safe in their homes."
