    "abstractText": "Although ionizing radiation (IR) is widely used for therapeutic and research purposes, studies on low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) are limited compared with those on other IR approaches, such as high-dose gamma irradiation and ultraviolet irradiation. High-dose IR affects DNA damage response and nucleotide\u2013protein crosslinking, among other processes; however, the molecular consequences of LDIR have been poorly investigated. Here, we developed a method to profile RNA species crosslinked to an RNA-binding protein, namely, human antigen R (HuR), using LDIR and high-throughput RNA sequencing. The RNA fragments isolated via LDIR-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing were crosslinked to HuR and protected from RNase-mediated digestion. Upon crosslinking HuR to target mRNAs such as PAX6, ZFP91, NR2F6, and CAND2, the transcripts degraded rapidly in human cell lines. Additionally, PAX6 and NR2F6 downregulation Biology 2023, 12, 1533. https://doi.org/10.3390/biology12121533 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biology Biology 2023, 12, 1533 2 of 15 mediated the beneficial effects of LDIR on cell viability. Thus, our approach provides a method for investigating post-transcriptional gene regulation using LDIR.",

            "text": "Understanding the biological effects of low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) is important, as healthcare workers and the general public are exposed to varied levels of radiation [1]. Toward this end, in vitro studies using humans, non-human animals, and cloned cells have been conducted. However, the biological effects of LDIR remain unclear, as direct means of evaluating or understanding these effects are unavailable [2,3]. In humans, IR induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which induce genotoxic stress and alter DNA damage reactions, enabling its application in the interventional radiology of cancer [4,5]. High-dose IR causes DNA lesions, indicating that many proteins act on the DNA to alter important cellular events such as cell cycle regulation, signaling, replication, transcription, and DNA repair [6\u20139]. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have recently been proposed as new players in DNA damage response by acting on the chromatin region [10\u201312]. However, transcriptional response in conjunction with DNA repair proteins and LDIR-mediated post-transcriptional gene regulation by RBPs has not been studied. Human antigen R (HuR)\u2014an RBP\u2014acts as a survival factor in IR-induced (10 Gy/various time points) DNA damage by modulating the translation of a subset of target mRNAs [13]. However, the impact of low dose rate IR (<5 Gy/h) on HuR-mediated post-transcriptional gene regulation needs to be explored using a transcriptome-wide approach. Ultraviolet (UV) crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) with high-throughput sequencing\u2014the most widely used transcriptomic approach for mapping RNA-protein interaction sites\u2014has opened new avenues for understanding the complex interaction network between RBPs and RNAs within the cell [14\u201316]. During the last decade, several derivatives of CLIPbased methods have emerged. For instance, photoactivable ribonucleoside-enhanced CLIP (PAR-CLIP) has been developed, incorporating photoactivatable modified nucleoside analogues such as 4-thiouridine to enhance crosslinking precision and efficiency [17\u201320]. Most CLIP-derivative methods rely on irradiating cells with UV light to induce covalent bond formation between proteins and directly associated RNAs. Considering that physical inducers of crosslinking, such as UV light, can induce molecular crosslinking between RBPs and RNAs, we aimed to investigate whether IR could induce crosslinking between RNAs and proteins, revealing its contribution to post-transcriptional gene regulation [21]. Here, we used LDIR-CLIP sequencing to capture the HuR-RNA interactome to identify HuR target mRNAs under LDIR exposure in order to understand the biological effects of LDIR in pathophysiological conditions such as cancer. Our results revealed that LDIR did not affect HuR localization or phosphorylation; however, the stability of the HuR protein following 12 h irradiation at 0.05 Gy was correlated with decreased stability of the HuR target mRNAs. These findings indicate that LDIR exposure for a relatively long duration may exert biological effects."

The pX458 plasmid was linearized with BbsI before insertion of the sgRNAs. Cloning was carried out using the DNA primers listed in Supplementary Table S1. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Wizard\u00ae Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) and amplified with Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). The corresponding primers spanned approximately 80 bp upstream to 80 bp downstream of the CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage site. The first round of PCR amplification utilized a 100 ng template per sample. Purification of PCR products was performed using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, a subsidiary of Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For the second round of PCR, 20 ng of the purified PCR products from the first round were annealed with Illumina adapter and barcode sequences. The primers for this PCR step are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The resulting products underwent isolation, purification, and mixing, then were subjected to 150 paired-end sequencing cycles on the HiSeq system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Approximately 20,000 cells were seeded in six-well plates containing 3 mL Opti-MEM without penicillin/streptomycin and incubated at 37 \u25e6C for 24 h.

            "text": "To profile transcripts crosslinked with RBP HuR (Figure 1A), we irradiated human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells at doses of 0.02\u20135 Gy. After 24 h irradiation, the cells were lysed and centrifuged and the supernatant was collected. After HuR immunoprecipitation and RNase T1 digestion, the protected RNA fragments were phosphorylated and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Autoradiography of RNA fragments crosslinked with HuR was performed to determine the complex size using SDS-PAGE (Figure 1B). Next, the complex was isolated and treated with proteinase K to purify RNAs that were then used for cDNA library preparation, PCR amplification, and high-throughput RNA sequencing. HuR LDIR-CLIP sequencing identified RNA fragments crosslinked to HuR and protected from RNase T1-mediated digestion. The largest number of independent RNA fragments was profiled after 24 h irradiation at doses of 0.02\u20135 Gy. In the 0.02 Gy-irradiated samples, 179 instances of crosslinking occurred in the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) across 21 transcripts, 231 in the codon-determining sequences (CDS) across 29 transcripts, 120 in the 3\u2032 UTR across 11 transcripts, and 1986 in the intronic sequences across 191 transcripts. (Figure 1C, Supplementary Table S2). Moreover, 53 common transcripts were isolated after 0.02 and 5 Gy irradiation (Figure 1D) and 68 transcripts overlapped with HuR PAR-CLIP, which was 0.9% of the total reads from the previous PAR-CLIP analysis [15] (Figure 1E, Supplementary Table S3). These results demonstrate that LDIR promotes HuR crosslinking with RNAs in a dose-dependent manner.\nBiology 2023, 12, 1533 6 of 15\nTo verify crosslinking of HuR and bound transcripts, we selected transcripts containing HuR-bound sequences in their CDS and UTRs, owing to the roles of HuR in target mRNA stability, localization, and translation. We focused on transcriptional regulators that broadly affect gene expression in response to LDIR. PAX6 (5\u2032 UTR), NR2F6 (5\u2032 UTR), CAND2 (5\u2032 UTR), and ZFP91 (5\u2032 UTR and CDS) were exclusively detected in the 0.02 Gy group following LDIR-CLIP sequencing and HuR PAR-CLIP. We performed experiments with various doses for LDIR-CLIP, however, we settled on 0.05 Gy, as we observed a decrease in the overall number of HuR-binding sites on target mRNAs after irradiation at doses greater than 0.2 Gy, in contrast to the observed effects at 0.02 Gy for 24 h in HEK293 cells (Figure 1D, Supplementary Table S2). We reasoned that 0.02 Gy might represent an extremely low level of irradiation, and that a 24 h duration might impose extreme conditions. Therefore, we opted for 0.05 Gy for 6 h as short-term exposure and for 12 h as long-term exposure for the\nBiology 2023, 12, 1533 7 of 15\nsubsequent experiments.

We selected HuR target RNAs from LDIR-CLIP following 0.02 Gy irradiation (Figure 1E) from the total RNA-seq. Our results revealed that 0.02 Gy irradiation slightly reduced the expression of a subset of HuR target RNAs detected using LDIR-CLIP (Figure 3E,F). Similarly, 5 Gy irradiation reduced the expression of a subset of HuR target RNAs detected using LDIR-CLIP (Figure 3G,H). Comparison of the target RNAs obtained after treatment with all the tested doses of irradiation to the non-target RNAs showed that LDIR decreased the expression of the HuR target RNAs at 6 and 12 h exposure to LDIR (Figure 3I,J), indicating that LDIR reduced the expression of a subset of HuR target RNAs detected using LDIR-CLIP in HEK293 cells. This prompted us to hypothesize that LDIR negatively impacts the expression of HuR target genes (Figure 4). Biology 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 16\nFigure 3.

The results revealed that longer exposure (12 h) to 0.05 Gy reduced the levels of many mRNA compared to a short exposure (6 h) (Supplementary Figure S1A,B). This observation is consistent with the findings in Figures 3\u20135, suggesting that prolonged low-dose exposure may exert biological effects. As suggested, molecular functions were analyzed using Gene Ontology (GO) analysis on differentially expressed genes. The affected molecular functions by LDIR were primarily related to DNA-binding after 6 h exposure and growth factor binding and activity after 12 h irradiation. These results suggest that LDIR potentially contributes to diverse biological processes and gene expression regulation (Supplementary Figure S1C,D).\nBiology 2023, 12, 1533 10 of 15 Biology 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 16\nFurthermore, we observed no changes in the protein levels of HuR target mRNAs.\nThis is because the incubation time (6 and 12 h) was insufficient to alter their translational\nlevels.

This implies that LDIR can suppress HuR activity, leading to decreased expression of HuR target genes, consistent with previous observations that HuR stabilizes its target mRNAs [23\u201325]. We next confirmed whether HuR KO and LDIR modulate the stability of HuR target mRNAs by measuring their stability. We treated HEK293 cells with actinomycin D 30 min before 0.05 Gy irradiation to shut off mRNA transcription. We harvested and lysed the cells at 0, 1, 2, and 4 h post-irradiation and performed RT-qPCR to measure the stability of these mRNAs. The stability of GAPDH\u2014a HuR non-target mRNA\u2014in HuR KO did not change significantly after 0.05 Gy irradiation. However, we observed the following: (1) 0.05 Gy irradiation in wild-type (WT) decreased the stability of HuR target mRNAs, with prolonged exposure (0.05 Gy/12 h) showing a more profound impact than 0.05 Gy/6 h, consistent with the observation that 12 h exposure decreased the steady-state levels of target mRNAs more significantly than 6 h exposure; (2) HuR KO without 0.05 Gy irradiation significantly decreased the half-life of HuR target mRNAs; and (3) HuR KO with 0.05 Gy/6 or 12 h irradiation fluctuated the stability of HuR target mRNAs depending on the incubation time (Figure 5A,B and Supplementary Figure S2B,C). Furthermore, we observed no changes in the protein levels of HuR target mRNAs. This is because the incubation time (6 and 12 h) was insufficient to alter their translational levels. Little or no HuR was crosslinked upon LDIR, barely influencing the expression of target genes (Figure 5D), indicating that HuR increased and decreased the stability of HuR target mRNAs under normal conditions and upon 0.05 Gy irradiation, respectively. To examine the molecular mechanisms by which HuR affects the decay of target mRNAs upon LDIR exposure, we hypothesized that LDIR influences HuR function by altering the stability of HuR target mRNAs. Cellular stress can influence the nuclear\u2013cytoplasmic shuttling of HuR, leading to changes in the landscape of HuR target RNAs [26]. We observed no influence on the HuR subcellular location after 0.05 Gy irradiation (Supplementary Figure S3A). Notably, HuR has numerous phosphorylation residues, and post-translational modification can influence both the subcellular localization of HuR and its binding to target mRNAs [27\u201329]. We observed that the phosphorylation status of HuR was not influenced by 0.05 Gy irradiation regardless of the exposure time compared with that in the control group (Supplementary Figure S3B,C). HuR protein stability can be modulated to maintain cellular homeostasis in response to stresses such as heat shock [30]. Interestingly, HuR protein stability slightly increased with the irradiation dose compared with that in the control (Supplementary Figure S3D), suggesting that HuR levels might increase when the irradiant energy crosses a certain threshold. These results indicate that LDIR did not influence the phosphorylation and cellular distribution of HuR but could increase the stability of HuR protein. Finally, we investigated whether LDIR-influenced cell viability depended on HuR target genes. We overexpressed PAX6 and NR2F6, confirmed our results using western blot analysis (Figure 5D), and measured the cell viability after 6 days of 0.05 Gy irradiation (Figure 5C). We found that 0.05 Gy irradiation increased the cell viability of WT compared with WT without irradiation. However, the cell viability of HuR KO cells subjected to 0.05 Gy irradiation did not change significantly, indicating that HuR was required to increase cell viability. Furthermore, PAX6 overexpression in WT subjected to 0.05 Gy irradiation decreased the cell viability compared with WT (without PAX6 overexpression) subjected to 0.05 Gy irradiation. PAX6 overexpression in HuR KO cells subjected to 0.05 Gy irradiation did not significantly change the cell viability. This indicates that PAX6 depletion might be required for HuR-mediated cell viability after 0.05 Gy irradiation. Moreover, we observed no change in cell viability after 0.05 Gy irradiation, and NR2F6 overexpression reduced cell viability with no change in PAX6 overexpression in HuR KO subjected to irradiation. This confirms that PAX6 depletion might be required for HuR-mediated cell viability after 0.05 Gy irradiation. Collectively, our results suggest that LDIR could induce covalent crosslinking between HuR and its target mRNAs, leading to destabilization of the target mRNAs (Figure 6).\nBiology 2023, 12, 1533 12 of 15i l , , x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 16\nIR modulates several biological processes that in turn affect post-transcriptional gene\nregulation.

RKO cells overexpressing HuR exhibited increas d lev ls of p53. C nversely, cells with decreased HuR expression demonstrated sign fi antly reduced p53 translation [35].

[36] repo ted decreased\nBiology 2023, 12, 1533 13 of 15\nexpression of CIRP-induced colony formation and reduced cell viability after irradiation. Additionally, cells with CIRP knockdown exhibited an increased rate of DNA damage and reduced ability to arrest the cell cycle after irradiation. Hence, in CIRP knockdown cells experiencing DNA damage induced by irradiation, the reduced DNA repair processes led to an increased rate of apoptosis. In this study, we discovered new targets, such as PAX6, ZFP91, NR2F6, and CAND2, whose expression was controlled by HuR in response to LDIR. Studies have shown that suppressing PAX6 expression increases cell proliferation, decreases apoptosis, and regulates cell cycle arrest in human retinoblastoma [37] and corneal epithelial cells [38]. In our study, increased cell viability in response to LDIR decreased in HuR WT cells overexpressing PAX6, though not in HuR KO cells. However, NR2F6 overexpression did not consistently regulate cell viability in LDIR-exposed HuR WT cells. NR2F6 expression reportedly regulates proliferation; in particular, NR2F6 knockdown significantly inhibits lung cancer cells via miR-142-3p [39,40]. Therefore, we presumed that NR2F6 RNA expression did not decrease, while PAX6 expression increased in response to LDIR due to a difference in the regulation mechanism of these genes. Our study has a number of limitations. First, the exact sites of LDIR-mediated HuRRNA crosslinking were unclear. Further exploration of molecular events and factors that influence LDIR-mediated crosslinking efficiencies can help to elucidate the influence of LDIR on gene regulation. Second, the LDIR effect was similar to that observed when HuR was knocked out in terms of the decreased steady-state levels and stability of the target mRNAs, suggesting that LDIR effects could be HuR-dependent. Therefore, the underlying mechanism(s) by which mRNAs crosslink with HuR upon LDIR exposure need to be explored. In conclusion, our findings suggest that HuR can be crosslinked with a set of target RNAs upon LDIR exposure. Furthermore, HuR target mRNAs may be degraded due to aberrant HuR-mRNA complex formation. Our approach provides a tool for studying post-transcriptional gene regulation in response to LDIR exposure."
