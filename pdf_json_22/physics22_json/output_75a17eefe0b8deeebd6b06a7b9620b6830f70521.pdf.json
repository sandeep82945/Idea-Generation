    "abstractText": "The low-lying HOMO level of the blue emitter and the interfacial miscibility of organic materials result in inferior hole injection, and long exciton lifetime leads to triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) and triplet-polaron annihilation (TPA), so the efficiencies of blue phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PhOLEDs) are still unsatisfactory. Herein, we design co-host and co-dopant structures to improve the efficiency of blue PhOLEDs by means of solution processing. TcTa acts as hole transport ladder due to its high-lying HOMO level, and bipolar mCPPO1 helps to balance carriers\u2019 distribution and weaken TPA. Besides the efficient FIr6, which acts as the dominant blue dopant, FCNIrPic was introduced as the second dopant, whose higher HOMO level accelerates hole injection and high triplet energy facilitates energy transfer. An interesting phenomenon caused by microcavity effect between anode and cathode was observed. With increasing thickness of ETL, peak position of electroluminescence (EL) spectrum red shifts gradually. Once the thickness of ETL exceeded 140 nm, emission peak blue-shifts went back to its original position. Finally, the maximum current efficiency (CE), power efficiency (PE), and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of blue phosphorescent organic light-emitting diode (PhOLED) went up to 20.47 cd/A, 11.96 lm/W, and 11.62%, respectively.",

            "text": "As a new solid-state light source, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are expected to be used in flat-panel displays and lighting applications, so they have been widely discussed by researchers [1\u20137]. Vacuum thermal evaporation and solution process are the two main technologies for the fabrication of OLEDs [8]. Compared with the vacuum evaporation process, the solution process is easier in terms of adjusting the proportion of host and guest materials in the doping system and is superior in large-scale production [9\u201313]. However, it is difficult to achieve efficient multi-stacked structures due to miscibility between organic layer interfaces in solution-processed devices and the wide band gaps (~3 eV) of phosphorescent materials which result in inferior hole injection. As such, triplet excitons are easily quenched by redundant carriers (TPA process) [14\u201316]. In addition, the long triplet excitons lifetimes (~\u00b5s) of phosphorescent materials lead to excitons accumulation, which would greatly increase the quenching probability of triplet excitons (TTA process) [17\u201319], so the solution-processed blue phosphorescent devices display relatively lower efficiency and inferior operation stability. Therefore, the lack of high-performance blue devices seriously restricts the market application of OLEDs.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 6882. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27206882 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 6882 2 of 12\nAt present, various methods have been proposed to improve device performances. One efficient strategy is designing a co-host system consisting of hole-transporting material and either electron-transporting or bipolar material to enhance carriers\u2019 balance and broaden recombination zone (RZ), thereby reducing driving voltage and improving device performances [20\u201324]. For example, Deepak and his colleagues prepared a co-host device by blending hole-transporting-type host material 4,4\u2032,4\u2032 \u2032-Tris(N-3-methylphenyl-N-phenylamino)-triphenylamine (m-MTDATA) and bipolar host material DT-320, which exhibited PE of 72.6 and 62.9 lm/W at 100 and 1000 cd/m2, respectively [25]. In addition, another feasible strategy is introducing sensitizers or dopants to realize efficient energy transfer [26\u201332]. Baldo and co-workers used green phosphor fac-Tris(2-phenylpyridine)iridium(III) (Ir(ppy)3) as a sensitizer to facilitate the transfer of triplet energy to red fluorescent emitter 4- (Dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-julolidyl-9-enyl-4H-pyran (DCM2) and realized significantly higher DCM2 emission efficiency [33]. Seung et al. selected double dopants of FIrpic and FIr6 to obtain the device with maximum CE of 24.8 cd/A and slow efficiency roll-off, and they proved the efficacy of the second dopant in stabilizing carriers\u2019 balance within the light-emitting layer (EML) and enhancing the energy transfer between two dopants [34]. In this work, we combined the mentioned two strategies by adopting a co-host system composed of bipolar material 9-(3-(9H-Carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)-3-(diphenylphosphor-yl)-9Hcarbazole (mCPPO1) and hole-transporting material 4,4\u2032,4\u2032\u2032-Tris(carbazol-9-yl)triphenylamine (TcTa) and introducing the second dopant Bis(3,5-difluoro-4-cyano-2-(2-pyridyl)phenyl(2-carboxypyridyl)iridium(III) (FCNIrPic) to facilitate carriers\u2019 balance as well as reduce exciton quenching, thus improving the efficiency of PhOLED. Subsequently, the roles of co-host and co-dopant in improving device performances were discussed in detail. Moreover, an interesting phenomenon, whereby the thickness of the electron transport layer (ETL) could significantly influence both efficiency and EL spectrum, was observed and interpreted. Finally, the maximum CE, PE, and EQE of optimized blue PhOLED device went up to 20.47 cd/A, 11.96 lm/W, and 11.62%, respectively."

            "text": "The energy levels diagram of designed devices and the molecular structures of used materials are shown in Figure 1. In this case, PEDOT: PSS film was spin-coated on an ITO-coated glass substrate as the hole injection layer (HIL). Meanwhile, 1,3,5-Tri[(3-pyridyl)phen-3-yl]benzene (TmPyPB), which exhibits high electron mobility and low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, was used as the electron-transporting and holeblocking material. Bis(2,4-difluorophenylpyridinato)tetrakis(1-pyrazolyl)borate iridium(III) (FIr6) is a deep-blue phosphorescent material with 73% photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQY) and high thermal stability, so we selected it as the emitter [35]. To construct high-performance PhOLED, the key is to select host and phosphorescent materials with matched energy levels and triplet energies [36]. Because of the high triplet energy (2.72 eV) of FIr6, it is difficult to select appropriated host materials with high enough triplet energy to prevent the reverse energy transfer from dopant to host molecules [37]. In addition, the low-lying HOMO energy level of FIr6 results in inferior hole injection, thus causing unbalanced carriers\u2019 distribution within EML. Therefore, we adopt a co-host system based on bipolar material mCPPO1 and hole-transporting material TcTa. The triplet energies of mCPPO1 (3.00 eV) and TcTa (2.80 eV) are both higher than that of FIr6, so reverse energy transfer can be well prevented [38,39]. Considering the relatively higher hole injection barrier (1 eV) between PEDOT: PSS (\u22125.20 eV) and mCPPO1 (\u22126.20 eV), direct hole injection from PEDOT: PSS to mCPPO1 is very difficult. In this case, TcTa (with moderate energy level of \u22125.70 eV) would function as hole transfer ladders, which could enhance hole injection, thus broadening RZ and improving carriers\u2019 balance.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 6882 3 of 12\nMolecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 12 2. Results and Discussion The energy levels diagram of designed devices and the molecular structures of used\nmaterials are shown in Figure 1. In this case, PEDOT: PSS film was spin-coated on an ITO-coated glass substrate as the hole injection layer (HIL). Meanwhile, 1,3,5-Tri[(3-pyridyl)-phen-3-yl]benzene (TmPyPB), which exhibits high electron mobility and low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, was used as the electron-transporting and hole-blocking material. Bis(2,4-difluorophenylpyridinato)tetrakis(1-pyrazolyl)borate iridium(III) (FIr6) is a deep-blue phosphorescent material with 73% photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQY) and high thermal stability, so we selected it as the emitter [35]. To construct high-performance PhOLED, the key is to select host and phosphorescent materials with matched energy levels and triplet energies [36]. Because of the high triplet energy (2.72 eV) of FIr6, it is difficult to select appropriated host materials with high enough triplet energy to prevent the reverse energy transfer from dopant to host molecules [37]. In addition, the low-lying HOMO energy level of FIr6 results in inferior hole injection, thus causing unbalanced carriers\u2019 distribution within EML. Therefore, we adopt a co-host system based on bipolar material mCPPO1 and hole-transporting material TcTa. The triplet energies of mCPPO1 (3.00 eV) and TcTa (2.80 eV) are both higher than that of FIr6, so reverse energy transfer can be well prevented [38,39]. Considering the relatively higher hole injection barrier (1 eV) between PEDOT: PSS (-5.20 eV) and mCPPO1 (-6.20 eV), direct hole injection from PEDOT: PSS to mCPPO1 is very difficult. In this case, TcTa (with moderate energy level of -5.70 eV) would function as hole transfer ladders, which could enhance hole injection, thus broadening RZ and improving carriers\u2019 balance.\nFigure 1.

Compared with the device based on singlehost mCPPO1, the co-host device showed lower turn-on voltage which confirms that the existence of TcTa molecules facilitated the injection of holes from HIL into EML due to the reduced energy barrier. In addition, co-host device showed higher maximum CE and slower efficiency roll-off compared with single mCPPO1 or single TcTa device. The higher CE suggests that bipolar mCPPO1 molecules are beneficial in facilitating the balance of electrons and holes within EML. The reduction rate of efficiency decreased from 40.26% and 50.13% in single-host devices to 30.7% in co-host devices within the current density range of 30\u201360 mA/cm2. Hence, the co-host system consisting of hole-transporting and bipolar material is helpful in improving device performances due to enhanced carriers\u2019 balance and broadening RZ. Besides, several devices with co-host system at various proportions were fabricated and compared, and the optimal proportion of TcTa: mCPPO1 = 1: 1 in the EML was determined to be the optimal proportion (Table 1).

Theoretically speaking, the higher energy level increases hole injection, which makes it easier to achieve carriers\u2019 balance and thus improved device performances. To confirm this assumption, we manufactured three hole-only devices with structures: ITO/PEDOT: PSS/mCPPO1: TcTa (1: 1)/TAPC (20 nm)/Al (100 nm), ITO/PEDOT: PSS/FIr6 (20 wt%): mCPPO1: TcTa (1: 1)/TAPC (20 nm)/Al (100 nm), and ITO/PEDOT: PSS/FIr6 (15 wt%): FCNIrPic (5 wt%): mCPPO1: TcTa (1: 1)/TAPC (20 nm)/Al (100 nm), respectively.

Materials and Methods In this study, all organic materials used in the devices were obtained from Luminescence Technology Corp. and used directly. Patterned indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glass (10 \u03a9/sq) was commercially obtained and used as the anode substrate. The ITO substrates were decontaminated with detergent, rinsed in ultra-purified water, dried at 120 \u00b0C for 1 h in oven, and then treated with ambient UV-ozone for 20 min. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) was spin-coated onto ITO substrates at the rate of 3000 rpm for 60 s and annealed at 120 \u00b0C for 20 min, after which they were transferred into inert-atmosphere glove box. Subsequently, the EML was spin-coated from a chlorobenzene solution onto the PEDOT: PSS layer at the rate of 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 70 \u00b0C for 30 min. Then, they were transferred into vacuum chamber to deposit ETL (\u2264 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 Pa) at the rate of 0.1 nm/s. Finally, LiF and Al were deposited in another vacuum chamber (\u2264 8.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 Pa) at rates of 0.01 and 1.0 nm/s, respectively. The current density-brightness-voltage (J-B-V) characteristics and EL spectra were measured by using Brightness Light Distribution Characteristics Measurement System C9920-11. The absorption spectra were measured with CARY 50UV-Vis-NIR Varian spectrophotometer (CA), while the photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer.\n4. Conclusion In summary, we have developed highly efficient solution-processed blue PhOLEDs by constructing co-dopant and co-host structures. Experimental results demonstrated that TcTa molecules function as hole transport ladders and the introduction of FCNIrPic molecules accelerates the transfer of holes onto emitter molecules, thus facilitating carriers\u2019 balance and enhancing light outcoupling efficiency. Furthermore, thicker ETL\nFigure 6. (a) EL spectra of OLEDs with various ETL thicknesses. (b) CIE coordinates of OLEDs with various ETL th cknesses. (c) L effic ency-ETL thickness characteristics of EDs with various ETL thicknesses.\nAccording to SK\u2019s computer model of wide-angle interference and Shogo\u2019s simple model with Fabry-Perot cavity structure, the intensity of EL varies quasi-sinusoidal [48,49]. In addition, d values corresponding to the first peak and trough of the EL intensity are a quarter and a half of the emission wavelength divided by the refractive index of the organic material, respectively [50\u201352]. However, when the ETL thick ess was increased to 120 nm (Figure 6c), a decreased efficiency was observed. On the one hand, it approaches the trough of EL intensity, and on the other hand, thicker ETL will significantly slow down electron transport and destroy the balance of electrons and holes within EML, thus reducing the recombination probability. Considering both efficiency and spectrum (Figures 5a and 6c), it can be easily identified that the optimal ETL thickness is about 80 nm. Among devices A-E, the optimal device was device C, which realized the maximum CE, PE, and EQE of 20.47 cd/A, 11.96 lm/W, and 11.62%, respectively (Table 4). Therefore, device performances can be improved by adjusting the thickness of ETL to balance carriers\u2019 dist ibution. Additionally, it can be concluded that EL spectrum is strongly influenced by the thickness of ETL, which can also affect the lig t ou coupling efficiency by adjusting the resonance wavelength of microcavity. In other words, current efficiency depends on not only the optical factors but also the transport and distribution of carriers. Therefore, the design of device should combine optics and carriers well in order to obtain high performances.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 6882 9 of 12"

Patterned indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glass (10 \u2126/sq) was commercially obtained and used as the anode substrate. The ITO substrates were decontaminated with detergent, rinsed in ultra-purified water, dried at 120 \u25e6C for 1 h in oven, and then treated with ambient UV-ozone for 20 min. Poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) was spin-coated onto ITO substrates at the rate of 3000 rpm for 60 s and annealed at 120 \u25e6C for 20 min, after which they were transferred into inert-atmosphere glove box. Subsequently, the EML was spin-coated from a chlorobenzene solution onto the PEDOT: PSS layer at the rate of 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 70 \u25e6C for 30 min. Then, they were transferred into vacuum chamber to deposit ETL (\u2264 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22126 Pa) at the rate of 0.1 nm/s. Finally, LiF and Al were deposited in another vacuum chamber (\u2264 8.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 Pa) at rates of 0.01 and 1.0 nm/s, respectively. The current density-brightness-voltage (J-B-V) characteristics and EL spectra were measured by using Brightness Light Distribution Characteristics Measurement System C9920-11. The absorption spectra were measured with CARY 50UV-Vis-NIR Varian spectrophotometer (CA), while the photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer."

With increasing thickness of ETL, EL spectrum red shifts firstly and then blue shifts quickly when the thickness of ETL reached 140 nm, which can be explained as microcavity effect between anode and cathode. Finally, the optimal blue phosphorescent device exhibited the maximum CE of 20.47 cd/A, PE of 11.96 lm/W, and EQE of 11.62%. These experimental results validated the efficacy of this device design strategy in preparing high-performance blue PhOLED.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Z.W. and R.W.; methodology, J.W. and L.Z; validation, J.W., J.Y. and X.L.; data curation, J.W.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, J.W.; writing\u2014review and editing, L.Z.; funding acquisition, L.Z.
