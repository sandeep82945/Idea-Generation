    "abstractText": "Aim/Purpose This paper examines the impact of the transformational, servant, and paternalistic leadership styles on employee performance at the middle and senior levels. Background Transdisciplinary research promotes the integration and development of various sciences. It provides more choices for leaders to adopt ways and practical activities to promote enterprise development. Complexity leadership theory emphasizes that effectively functioning organizations need distinct forms of leadership to work together. Leaders rely on different leadership practices in an emergent collaborative context, and finding an optimal balance is challenging. Many scholars have attempted to explore which leadership styles have a more significant impact on employees by distinguishing and defining types of leadership styles and explaining the process by which they influence employee behavior and performance. Various scholars have further explored and empirically demonstrated the impact of these three types of leadership styles (transformational, servant, paternalistic)on employee performance. While transformational and servant leadership have their roots in the West, paternalistic leadership has roots in China. Few scholars have conducted comparative studies on their positive impact on employee performance. How do these three leadership styles affect employee performance at the middle and senior levels in the Chinese context? Which combination of middle and senior leadership styles performs best? These are the second area that this paper will attempt to explore. Methodology This study constructs a three-tier model at the senior, middle, and grassroots levels. A questionnaire survey was used to collect data. SPSS 22.0 and Amos were used for data analysis. Contribution Through its construction of a three-tier model (senior, middle, and grassroots levels), the paper explores the combined effect of three leadership styles (transformational, servant, and paternalistic) on grassroots employees. It explores the The Impact of Middle and Senior Leadership Styles on Employee Performance 124 impact of senior leaders across levels on grassroots employee performance, which is expected to provide a valuable addition to theories on leadership styles. It is also instructive to examine which leadership style performs better and what middle and senior leadership configurations are more conducive to driving beneficial employee behavior and, ultimately, corporate growth. Findings The transformational, servant, and paternalistic leadership styles, both at the top and middle levels, have a significant positive relationship with employee performance; the middle leadership style plays a positive mediating role between the top leadership style and employee performance. In terms of impact on employee performance, transformational leadership shows the best results at both the top and middle levels, with paternalistic leadership second and servant leadership at the same level. Regarding which middle and senior leadership style pairing is the best, the sample is relatively small, and the gap between various pairing combinations is not evident from the data. If the sample size is enlarged, the coefficient will likely expand year-on-year. Therefore, we can assume that the pairing effect of top servant leadership and middle transformational leadership is the best, top paternalistic leadership and middle transformational leadership is the second-best, and the combination of top paternalistic leadership and middle-level servant leadership leaders is the weakest. Recommendations for researchers This paper extends the study of top and middle leadership\u2019s combined effect on employee performance as a positive response to the call for multi-layer or crosslayer analysis in leadership research. The findings further enrich the literature on leadership style-related theories. The middle leadership style plays a positive mediating role between the top leadership style and employee performance. The trickle-down effect is further verified, i.e., the top leadership will have a permeating influence on employees through the middle leadership, and the top\u2019s influence on the middle is generally more significant than the influence on grassroots employees. However, the difference between the influence of the middle leadership on the grassroots and that of the top on the grassroots is not apparent, which is inconsistent with the trickle-down effect that the middle leadership communicates more with the grassroots and has more influence on the grassroots, and further verification is needed. All three types of leaders positively affected employee performance, with the best being transformational leadership, paternalistic leadership, and servant leadership. This finding is consistent with some scholars and inconsistent with some scholars. The interested scholars can do further research. The better performance of diverse pairings in middle and senior leadership combinations is consistent with previous research suggesting that leadership styles have their own strengths and can be complementary. This paper further provides a comparative study of multiple leadership styles to validate the recognition and adaptability of leadership styles and further explain the complex relationship between leadership styles and employee job performance. Scholars can conduct comparative research on other leadership styles, and there may be different results. Recommendations for Practitioners The findings of this paper have some reference value for the choice of leadership behaviors of corporate managers and the formation of middle and senior leadership teams. Transformational, paternalistic, and servant leadership all positively influence employee performance. All play a positive mediating role at the",

It provides more choices for leaders to adopt ways and practical activities to promote enterprise development. Complexity leadership theory emphasizes that effectively functioning organizations need distinct forms of leadership to work together. Leaders rely on different leadership practices in an emergent collaborative context, and finding an optimal balance is challenging. Many scholars have attempted to explore which leadership styles have a more significant impact on employees by distinguishing and defining types of leadership styles and explaining the process by which they influence employee behavior and performance. Various scholars have further explored and empirically demonstrated the impact of these three types of leadership styles (transformational, servant, paternalistic)on employee performance. While transformational and servant leadership have their roots in the West, paternalistic leadership has roots in China. Few scholars have conducted comparative studies on their positive impact on employee performance. How do these three leadership styles affect employee performance at the middle and senior levels in the Chinese context? Which combination of middle and senior leadership styles performs best? These are the second area that this paper will attempt to explore.\nMethodology This study constructs a three-tier model at the senior, middle, and grassroots levels. A questionnaire survey was used to collect data. SPSS 22.0 and Amos were used for data analysis.\nContribution Through its construction of a three-tier model (senior, middle, and grassroots levels), the paper explores the combined effect of three leadership styles (transformational, servant, and paternalistic) on grassroots employees. It explores the\nimpact of senior leaders across levels on grassroots employee performance, which is expected to provide a valuable addition to theories on leadership styles. It is also instructive to examine which leadership style performs better and what middle and senior leadership configurations are more conducive to driving beneficial employee behavior and, ultimately, corporate growth.\nFindings The transformational, servant, and paternalistic leadership styles, both at the top and middle levels, have a significant positive relationship with employee performance; the middle leadership style plays a positive mediating role between the top leadership style and employee performance. In terms of impact on employee performance, transformational leadership shows the best results at both the top and middle levels, with paternalistic leadership second and servant leadership at the same level. Regarding which middle and senior leadership style pairing is the best, the sample is relatively small, and the gap between various pairing combinations is not evident from the data. If the sample size is enlarged, the coefficient will likely expand year-on-year. Therefore, we can assume that the pairing effect of top servant leadership and middle transformational leadership is the best, top paternalistic leadership and middle transformational leadership is the second-best, and the combination of top paternalistic leadership and middle-level servant leadership leaders is the weakest.\nRecommendations for researchers\nThis paper extends the study of top and middle leadership\u2019s combined effect on employee performance as a positive response to the call for multi-layer or crosslayer analysis in leadership research. The findings further enrich the literature on leadership style-related theories. The middle leadership style plays a positive mediating role between the top leadership style and employee performance. The trickle-down effect is further verified, i.e., the top leadership will have a permeating influence on employees through the middle leadership, and the top\u2019s influence on the middle is generally more significant than the influence on grassroots employees. However, the difference between the influence of the middle leadership on the grassroots and that of the top on the grassroots is not apparent, which is inconsistent with the trickle-down effect that the middle leadership communicates more with the grassroots and has more influence on the grassroots, and further verification is needed.\nAll three types of leaders positively affected employee performance, with the best being transformational leadership, paternalistic leadership, and servant leadership. This finding is consistent with some scholars and inconsistent with some scholars. The interested scholars can do further research.\nThe better performance of diverse pairings in middle and senior leadership combinations is consistent with previous research suggesting that leadership styles have their own strengths and can be complementary. This paper further provides a comparative study of multiple leadership styles to validate the recognition and adaptability of leadership styles and further explain the complex relationship between leadership styles and employee job performance. Scholars can conduct comparative research on other leadership styles, and there may be different results.\nRecommendations for Practitioners\nThe findings of this paper have some reference value for the choice of leadership behaviors of corporate managers and the formation of middle and senior leadership teams. Transformational, paternalistic, and servant leadership all positively influence employee performance. All play a positive mediating role at the\nmiddle level; therefore, adopting any of these leadership behaviors has a positive effect on the company. Although transformational leadership performs better in the middle to the senior portfolio, transformational, servant, and paternalistic leadership have their strengths. They can be complementary in improving employee performance, so servant and paternalistic leadership styles still need to be considered in the context of information technology and Chinese culture. In addition, companies should pay more attention to middle leadership because it mediates the influence of senior leadership on employees. Practicing leaders will gain from this research by balancing leadership roles according to individual characteristics, organizational characteristics, and stages of growth. Business leaders should also adapt their leadership style and management style to meet the changing needs of the company in order to achieve the goal of stable and sustainable development.\nFuture Research Because of the cross-sectional data taken, the findings\u2019 generalizability still needs further validation. There are many types of leadership styles, and there are other types of leadership styles that can be explored comparatively, perhaps leading to different findings. From another point of view, various leaders have their strengths, and they are not mutually hindering. More research is needed on team formation in a variety of contexts. Organic organizational structure enables knowledge creation and integration through the process of organizational learning through deep and continuous social interaction or dialogue. So we can further examine the influence process of leaders on employees from how to give full play to their advantages, such as improving shared leadership and shared communication.\nKeywords leadership, transformational, servant, paternalistic, employee performance, trickle-down effect"

            "text": "Transdisciplinary research collaborations promote the integration and development of various sciences. They provide more choices for leaders to adopt ways and practical activities to promote the development of enterprises. Complexity leadership theory emphasizes that effectively functioning organizations need distinct forms of leadership to work together, but leaders rely on different types of leadership practices. Finding an optimal balance between them is challenging in an emergent collaborative context. In the context of the transdisciplinary research organization, it seemed that the different leadership functions were not sufficiently entangled. Instead, they formed a leadership toolbox from which the leaders selected a function and related leadership practices that suited a given situation (M\u00e4kinen, 2018). So what management leadership style works best? Are there different styles that work best for top and middle-level leads? This paper attempts to answer that question by surveying enterprises in China.\nInfluencing employees to achieve performance goals by recognizing leadership styles and adjusting leadership behaviors has become one of the crucial ways to enhance the core competitiveness and maintain a competitive advantage for enterprises in the information age. The top management team endeavors to reverse the passive situation of the company; different types of top leadership styles have a differentiated impact on the company\u2019s performance (Ren et al., 2021). The trickle-down effect in the field of leadership behavior confirms that leadership behavior can gradually spread from top to bottom through the middle level and eventually affect the grassroots employees (Wayne et al., 2008), implying that top leadership style may affect employee job performance through the middle level. In existing studies, scholars have more often studied the role of superior leadership behavior on the binary level of subordinates or simply explored the impact of corporate CEO leadership behavior on corporate performance. Less often have they explored the combined effect of top-level\nleadership and mid-level leadership on subordinates (Song et al., 2009). Therefore, do top-level leadership styles influence employee job performance through mid-level leadership? Is the role of the middle level on the relationship between top-level leadership style and employee job performance weakened or strengthened? It becomes the first aspect of the question that this paper attempts to explore.\nLeadership style is an important variable that affects the performance of subordinates, and different leadership styles have different significant effects on employees\u2019 performance (L. Yang & Wang, 2012). Many scholars have attempted to explore which leadership styles have a more significant impact on employees by distinguishing and defining types of leadership styles and explaining the process by which they influence employee behavior and performance. Among the leadership styles that have received more attention so far, transformational leadership theory proposes that the goal of improving employee performance levels can be achieved through the interaction between leaders and employees (Burns, 1978); servant leadership theory suggests that leaders should place service to others, to the organization, and to society above to their own interests, so that employees can progress in being served (Greenleaf, 1977: Spears, 1998). Paternalistic leadership is characterized by strict discipline and authority, fatherly benevolence, and moral integrity in an atmosphere of human rule. This style influences the behavior of subordinates through different paths of reverence and obedience, recognition and emulation, and gratitude (Farh & Cheng, 2000; Redding, 1990). Various scholars have further explored and empirically demonstrated the impact of these three types of leadership styles on employee performance. However, most of the existing literature investigates the effect of a particular leadership style on employee performance (C. Li & Shi, 2003; Liden et al., 2008; Mayer et al. 2009; Xia & Shan, 2019), and a few comparative studies of two different leadership styles have been conducted (Deng et al., 2012; C. Li et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2014). While transformational and servant leadership have their roots in the West, paternalistic leadership has roots in China. Few scholars have conducted comparative studies on their positive impact on employee performance. How do these three leadership styles affect employee performance at the middle and senior levels in the Chinese context? Which combination of middle and senior leadership styles performs best? These are the second area that this paper will attempt to explore.\nThis paper uses a three-tier model at the senior, middle, and grassroots levels to explore the combined effect of the transformational, servant, and paternalistic leadership styles on grassroots employees. It also explores the impact of senior leaders across levels on grassroots employee performance, which is expected to provide a valuable addition to theories on leadership styles. It is also instructive to examine which type of leadership style performs better. These three leaders have their own advantages and can coexist harmoniously in the same enterprise. The combination of middle and senior leadership configurations is more conducive to driving beneficial employee behavior and, ultimately, corporate growth."

            "text": "The research model in Figure 1 is proposed. This section reviews the findings of the three leadership styles (transformational, servant, and paternalistic) and presents the hypotheses. Although the existing studies do not clearly distinguish between top and middle leaders, they are all company managers, whether they are top or middle leaders. Therefore, the hypothesis section argues that the existing theories are open to inference for both top and middle levels.\nTHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP AND EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE Burns (1978) first proposed that transformational leadership is how leaders and subordinates interact to achieve increased levels of maturity and motivation. Bass (1985) then proposed the theory of transformational leadership, in which he argued that transformational leadership consists of a fourdimensional structure of charisma, inspiration, intellectual stimulation(Bass & Avolio, 1990), and personalized care by making employees aware of the importance of the task they are undertaking, stimulating them to develop higher-level needs, and establishing a climate of mutual trust so that subordinates are willing to sacrifice their personal interests to achieve organizational benefits and to achieve results beyond expectations (Bass, 1995). C. Li and Shi (2003) examined the validity of the four dimensions of Bass\u2019 transformational leadership concept. They found no significant effect of evocative and personalized care on leader effectiveness, no significant effect of personalized care on leader satisfaction, and developed a culturally appropriate scale for Chinese culture, including the dimensions of virtuous modeling, leading charisma, visionary motivation, and personalized care (C. Li & Shi, 2005; D. Ye, 2010).\nTransformational leadership has a positive impact on employee behavior. Judge et al. (2004) showed a positive relationship between transformational leadership and employee job satisfaction. H. Yang et al. (2011) found that any employee in a company has the ability and potential to generate new ideas and create new things. The innovation of employees can form the innovative force of the company and thus improve the company\u2019s competitiveness, and transformational leaders play a decisive role in it. L. Yang and Wang (2012) found that transformational leaders can enhance employee behavior through effective communication and the transfer of knowledge and information to and from employees. Pieterse et al. (2010) argued that transformational leadership positively affects employees\u2019 innovative behavior when they feel high psychological empowerment. X. Li et al. (2015) found that transformational leadership positively promotes good relationships with employees. He and Ling (2010) argued that transformational leadership motivates employees to work more proactively and passionately and to think to enhance their organizational identity, improving individual performance levels. Meng et al. (2011) found that transformational leadership enhances employees\u2019 ability and courage to overcome difficulties, thus ensuring the successful completion of work tasks and goals and maximizing their own performance and job satisfaction.\nBased on the above, this paper hypothesizes that:\nH1: Top-level transformational leadership has a positive impact on employee performance.\nH2: Mid-level transformational leadership has a positive impact on employee performance.\nTHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PATERNALISTIC LEADERSHIP AND EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE Redding\u2019s (1990) study of top management problems in Chinese family companies proposed a paternalistic leadership with Chinese leadership characteristics. Farh and Cheng (2000) defined paternalistic leadership as a leadership style characterized by strict discipline and authority, fatherly kindness, and moral integrity in an atmosphere of human rule. Cheng et al. (2000) further developed the ternary structure of paternalistic leadership, which includes authoritative leadership, virtuous leadership, and benevolent leadership. Paternalistic leadership is widely found in enterprises, institutions, and other public organizations in Chinese culture and can be found worldwide (Cheng et al., 2003).\nChinese scholars have empirically studied the effects of paternalistic leadership on employee performance from different industries, and paternalistic leadership emphasizes emotional communication between leaders and employees, which can bring positive effects on employees\u2019 emotional and cognitive trust and can improve employee performance when embraced by employees (G. Yu et al., 2017). In the college teaching profession, paternalistic leadership through personalized care can motivate college teachers to improve job evaluation and career satisfaction, thus job performance in accomplishing job requirements (Qiu & Yang, 2015). Paternalistic leadership has good cultural adaptability in industries with clear and concise systems and more stable work environments and content. These industries include primary hospital nursing profession; paternalistic leadership behaviors of nurse leaders who convince others with virtue, high moral quality, and extremely high ethical codes are more persuasive and can subconsciously influence subordinates to develop trust, respect, and followership, to show more positive work behaviors, and have an impact on subordinates\u2019 organizational citizenship behaviors and improved job performance with tangible effects (Xia & Shan, 2019).\nBased on the above, this paper hypothesizes that\nH3\uff1aTop-level paternalistic leadership has a positive impact on employee performance.\nH4\uff1aMid-level paternalistic leadership has a positive impact on employee performance.\nTHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SERVANT LEADERSHIP AND EMPLOYEE"

            "text": "Greenleaf (1977) argues that \u201cservice\u201d should be the distinguishing characteristic of leadership, where the leader leads by setting a good example, is willing to be a servant, and leads by serving. Barbuto and Wheeler (2006) argue that servant leadership consists of dimensions as follows: altruism, emotional soothing, intellectual enlightenment, rational persuasive guidance, and social responsibility, etc. C. Wang et al. (2009) developed a localized scale in China to measure servant leadership style at various levels of organizations, departments, and grassroots units. The servant-leader is a leadership style that focuses on the needs and interests of others. It places the interests of subordinates first, and cares about the growth, development, and success of employees morally and ethically, helping subordinates achieve their own goals as well as the overall goals of the organization and society (P. Chen et al., 2016).\nServant leadership emphasizes interaction with employees, making employees feel respected and valued, more secure, and more trustful of their leaders (J. Wang et al., 2017). Employees are motivated to work with a positive attitude of \u201cownership\u201d and \u201cservant\u201d to accomplish their work and ultimately drive performance goals (Y. Li & Ge, 2020). Servant leaders focus more on the interests of employees and can have cross-level influence (B. Ye et al., 2021), improving the performance of subordinates at both the municipal and township levels (Yan et al., 2017). Servant leadership is also shown to have a lasting impact on employees\u2019 current job performance and indirectly on employees\u2019 current job performance through their previous job performance (Ling & Wang, 2010).\nBased on the above, this paper hypothesizes that:\nH5: Top-level servant leadership has a positive impact on employee performance.\nH6: Mid-level servant leadership has a positive impact on employee performance.\nMEDIATION OF MIDDLE LEADERSHIP STYLE ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SENIOR LEADERSHIP STYLE AND EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE Leadership is not a direct path in influencing employees\u2019 job performance but is through a series of processes (B. Yu & Liu, 2008). Different dimensions affect employees\u2019 job attitudes (C. Li et al., 2006), and leaders at each management level influence employees\u2019 job attitudes, job behaviors, and job performance (Waldman & Yammarino, 1999). Leaders at different levels of management have different roles to play and have different effects on employee performance. The \u201ctrickle-down effect\u201d suggests that the leadership behavior of top management will have a broader impact on the whole organization. The leadership behavior of senior leaders will have a \u201ctrickle-down effect\u201d on employees\u2019 work behavior (Mayer et al., 2009). The leadership climate of senior leaders will indirectly affect employees\u2019 work behavior through the leadership climate of lower-level leaders (Ling, Wang, Zhang, & Chen, 2010; Ling, Wang, Zhang, & Liu, 2010). Middle and junior leaders are more likely to interact directly with front-line employees than senior leaders. Their leadership behaviors have a more direct impact on employees\u2019 feelings, attitudes, and behaviors. This paper argues that middle-level leaders, compared to senior leaders, have more frequent, longer, and broader contact with general employees and can play a good role in carrying on the top and bottom (G. Chen & Bliese, 2002).\nBased on the above, this paper hypothesizes that:\nH7: Mid-level transformational leadership mediates the relationship between top-level transformational leadership and employee performance.\nH8: Mid-level transformational leadership mediates the relationship between top-level paternalistic leadership and employee performance.\nH9: Mid-level transformational leadership mediates the relationship between top-level servant leadership and employee performance.\nH10: Mid-level paternalistic leadership mediates the relationship between top-level transformational leadership and employee performance.\nH11: Mid-level paternalistic leadership mediates the relationship between top-level paternalistic leadership and employee performance.\nH12: Mid-level paternalistic leadership mediates the relationship between top-level servant leadership and employee performance.\nH13: Mid-level servant leadership mediates the relationship between top-level transformational leadership and employee performance.\nH14: Mid-level servant leadership mediates the relationship between top-level paternalistic leadership and employee performance.\nH15: Mid-level servant leadership mediates the relationship between top-level servant leadership and employee performance."

It also shows that the middle leadership style positively mediates the top leadership style and employee performance. In terms of impact on employee performance, transformational leadership shows the best results at both the top and middle levels, with paternalistic leadership second and finally servant leadership at the same level.\nRegarding which middle and senior leadership style pairing is the best, the sample is relatively small, and the gap between various pairing combinations is not evident from the data. If the sample size is enlarged, the coefficient will likely expand year-on-year. Therefore, we can assume that the pairing effect of top servant leadership and middle transformational leadership is the best, the combination of top paternalistic leadership and middle transformational leadership is the second-best, and the combination of top paternalistic leadership and middle-level servant leaders is the weakest."

            "text": "This paper extends the study of top and middle leadership\u2019s combined effect on employee performance as a positive response to the call for multi-layer or cross-layer analysis in leadership research. The findings further enrich the literature on leadership style-related theories. The middle leadership style plays a positive mediating role between the top leadership style and employee performance. The trickle-down effect is further verified, i.e., the top leadership will have a permeating influence on employees through the middle leadership, and the top\u2019s influence on the middle is generally more significant than the influence on grassroots employees. However, the difference between the influence of the middle leadership on the grassroots and the influence of the top on the grassroots is not apparent, which is inconsistent with the trickle-down effect that the middle leadership communicates more with the grassroots and has more influence on the grassroots, and further verification is needed.\nAll three types of leaders showed a positive effect on employee performance, with the best being transformational leadership, followed by paternalistic leadership, and finally servant leadership. This finding is consistent with C. Li et al.\u2019s (2007) finding that transformational leadership has a stronger predictive power on leadership effectiveness than paternalistic leadership in this particular cultural context in China. It is also consistent with H. Yu et al.\u2019s (2014) study, which found that paternalistic leadership behaviors increased employee performance more significantly than servant-leadership behaviors. However, findings are inconsistent with Deng et al.\u2019s (2012) finding that servant leadership has higher leadership effectiveness than paternalistic leadership for employees in mainland Chinese firms. This finding is different from that of this paper\u2019s study. Interested scholars can do further research.\nThe better performance of diverse pairings in middle and senior leadership combinations is consistent with previous research suggesting that leadership styles have their own strengths and can be complementary. For example, Ju et al. (2008) found paternalistic leadership\u2019s dimensions of virtue and benevolence were superior in maintaining employees\u2019 emotions and job satisfaction. Transformational leadership was superior in organizational commitment and superior-subordinate communication. H. Yu et al. (2014) found that paternalistic leadership improved employee performance more significantly than servant leadership, and servant leadership improved employee satisfaction more significantly than paternalistic leadership, and that the positive effects of paternalistic leadership on job performance and job satisfaction were stronger to achieve optimal leadership effectiveness when moderated by high levels of servant leadership behaviors. This paper further provides a comparative study of multiple leadership styles to validate the recognition and adaptability of leadership styles and further explains the complex relationship between leadership styles and employee job performance. Scholars can conduct comparative research on other leadership styles, and there may be different results."

            "text": "The findings of this paper have some reference value for the choice of leadership behaviors of corporate managers and the formation of middle and senior leadership teams. Transformational, paternalistic, and servant leadership all positively influence employee performance. All play a positive mediating role at the middle level; therefore, adopting any of these leadership behaviors has a positive effect on the company. However, the transformational leadership style that performs best for an individual is not simply used to form the middle and senior leadership team. Instead, the beneficial elements of transformational, paternalistic, and servant leadership behaviors are supposed to be incorporated and adapted to improve the performance of private companies in the context of informing in the Chinese culture. In addition, companies should pay more attention to middle leadership because it mediates the influence of senior leadership on employees.\nPracticing leaders will gain from this research by balancing leadership roles according to individual characteristics, organizational characteristics, and stages of growth (Petter, 2000). Business leaders should also adapt their leadership style and management style to meet the changing needs of the company in order to achieve the goal of stable and sustainable development. For middle and senior leadership style configuration, it could be seen that when the senior leadership is the transformational type, the middle servant type leadership goes best with it. When the senior leadership is servant or paternalistic, the middle transformational type leadership performs best with it. We can select the most suitable middle and senior leaders in the corporate practice, like recruitment, to help communication between middle and senior leaders, and even to transfer to the best leadership style configuration in boosting agreement and implement of strategies. For example, when the senior leaders are transformational, the middle leaders should adopt a servant leadership style. Doing so will help the middle and senior leaders reach high-quality decisions and help the middle leaders achieve the best performance in mediating the performance of senior leaders and employees, and then promote the implementation of decisions to achieve employee performance."

            "text": "Because cross-sectional data were taken, the generalizability of the findings still needs further validation. There are many types of leadership styles, and there are other types of leadership styles that can be explored comparatively, perhaps leading to different findings. From another point of view, various leaders have their own advantages, and they are not mutually hindering. More research is needed on team formation in various contexts (Salazar & Lant, 2018). An organic organizational structure supports knowledge creation and integration through organizational learning with deep and continuous social interaction or dialogue (Trivedi & Misra, 2018).\nThus we can further examine the influence of leaders on employees. We can explore how to use their advantages, such as improving shared leadership and shared communication (Morgan et al., 2021). This finding aligns with the advocacy of interdisciplinary research to strengthen communication and the practical skills that enterprise managers should have to maintain competitiveness in today\u2019s rapid development of information."
