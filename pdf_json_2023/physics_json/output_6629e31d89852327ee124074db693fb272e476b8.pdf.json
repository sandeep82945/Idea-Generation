    "abstractText": "The introduction of lithiated components with different Li/Li isotopic ratios, also called isotopic tracing, can give access to better understanding of lithium transport and lithiation processes in lithiumion batteries. In this work, we propose a simple methodology based on high-resolution solid-state NMR for the determination of the Li/Li ratio in silicon electrodes following different strategies of isotopic tracing. The Li and Li MAS NMR experiments allow obtaining resolved spectra whose spectral components can be assigned to different moieties of the materials. In order to measure the ratio of the Li/Li NMR integrals, a silicon electrode with a natural Li/Li isotope abundance was used as a reference. This calibration can then be used to determine the Li/Li ratio of any similar samples. This method was applied to study the phenomena occurring at the interface between a silicon electrode and a labeled electrolyte, which is an essential step for isotopic tracing experiments in systems after the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Beyond the isotopic exchanges between the SEI and the electrolyte already observed in the literature, our results show that isotopic exchanges also involve Li\u2013Si alloys in the electrode bulk. Within a 52-hour contact, the electrolyte labeling disappeared: isotopic concentrations of the electrolyte and electrode become practically homogenized. However, at the electrode level, different silicides are characterized by rather different isotopic enrichment. In the present work, ToF SIMS and liquid state NMR were also used to cross-check and discuss the solid-state NMR method we have proposed.",

In this work, we propose a simple methodology based on high-resolution solid-state NMR for the determination of the 7Li/6Li ratio in silicon electrodes following different strategies of isotopic tracing. The 6Li and 7Li MAS NMR experiments allow obtaining resolved spectra whose spectral\ncomponents can be assigned to different moieties of the materials. In order to measure the ratio of the 6Li/7Li NMR integrals, a silicon electrode with a natural 7Li/6Li isotope abundance was used as a reference. This calibration can then be used to determine the 7Li/6Li ratio of any similar samples. This\nmethod was applied to study the phenomena occurring at the interface between a silicon electrode and\na labeled electrolyte, which is an essential step for isotopic tracing experiments in systems after the\nformation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Beyond the isotopic exchanges between the SEI and\nthe electrolyte already observed in the literature, our results show that isotopic exchanges also involve\nLi\u2013Si alloys in the electrode bulk. Within a 52-hour contact, the electrolyte labeling disappeared:\nisotopic concentrations of the electrolyte and electrode become practically homogenized. However, at\nthe electrode level, different silicides are characterized by rather different isotopic enrichment. In the\npresent work, ToF SIMS and liquid state NMR were also used to cross-check and discuss the solid-state\nNMR method we have proposed."

However, depending on the questions being addressed, they have not been developed and applied to the same extent. In the field of materials for energy storage, such an approach has been proposed to study Li-ion batteries, though it still remains at a very early stage. Since 2011, only a dozen publications have used it for studying the SEI structure,2 SEI formation3 and Li\ndiffusion.4\u201310 In this field, carbon and lithium nuclei are the favorite probes. As a matter of fact, lithium plays a crucial role in the operation of Li-ion batteries since it acts as a shuttle from one electrode to the other but it is also involved in many side reactions in various media at different states: the liquid phase of the electrolyte, the solid phase of electrode materials and the solid interphase between the negative electrode and the electrolyte (SEI).\nDuring the first lithiation of the anode, part of the electrolyte is decomposed by reduction. Insoluble degradation products remain at the negative electrode surface and give rise to the SEI. The soluble counterpart remains in the electrolyte itself. A portion of lithium appears to be irreversibly trapped in the SEI associated with capacity fading. Carbon as a major element of the electrolyte is detected not only in the liquid phase but also in the SEI solid phase. It is also present in binder or conductive additives. Although it can be considered as a key element of Li-ion batteries, it remains a difficult probe compared with Li, especially for NMR due to its low sensitivity and the huge number of expected chemical shifts.

In most of these experiments, an electrode is immersed in an electrolyte. Investigations on a model SEI using Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) analysis have already shown that Li isotope exchanges take place quickly (B30 s) between the electrolyte and the SEI.2 Similar isotope exchanges have been also observed on delithiated graphite electrodes via ToF-SIMS with the same types of experiments.10 The results show that the diffusion of Li ions from the electrolyte to the SEI is very fast: the isotopic exchange is almost achieved in less than 20 min. From this, the thickness of the mineral part of the SEI has been estimated. However, while the Li isotope exchanges have been demonstrated between the electrolyte and SEI, no study has been realized considering Li in the active material. For instance, in the experiments carried out by Ilott et al.15 and Gunnarsdo\u0301ttir et al.,17 they soaked a 6Li metal piece in an electrolyte containing 7Li and then monitored 7Li NMR signals, corresponding to both the metal and the electrolyte during all the prolonged contact. In parallel, a numerical model has been developed to describe the process. It allowed them to quantify the growth of the SEI and the evolution of ion permeability into the Li metal. For isotopic tracing, the solid-state NMR is a promising tool since in addition to the quantitative analysis of each isotope, 7Li and 6Li, it provides information on their chemical environments. For instance, in a siliconbased electrode, the different silicides can be easily distinguished with solid-state 6,7Li NMR.19,20 This technique also enables to detect Li dendrites on graphite21 and lithium metal electrodes.22 Moreover, recent studies on either in situ NMR or in situ MRI raise a lot of expectations, especially to follow Li isotope exchange under operando conditions.22 It is worthwhile to recall that NMR analyzes the whole sample, and some experimental conditions have to be fulfilled to provide quantitative data.\nConcerning lithium at natural abundance, it has two isotopes 7Li (I = 3/2) and 6Li (I = 1) at 92.6% and 7.4%, respectively. On non-labelled compounds, the 7Li and 6Li fractions are expected to remain constant, while by introducing a 6Lienriched component during battery assembly, the evolution of the 7Li/6Li ratio after battery cycling enables to identify various processes and trace lithium pathways. In principle, this\ncan be easily done by acquiring quantitative data for each isotope. However, such an approach would require the use of an internal lithium reference inside the studied sample. This strategy is generally followed in liquid-state NMR. However, for solid materials, it appeared worthwhile to develop a method, without an internal reference, to quantify 7Li and 6Li using high resolution solid-state NMR techniques. It is the objective of this work.\nThe method we have developed was tested on several samples with unknown 7Li/6Li isotope ratios. These samples consist of lithiated silicon-based electrodes in which isotopic enrichment was performed using an electrochemical method. The main 6Li enrichment setups that were used in the present work are illustrated in Fig. 1.\nTo validate the methodology based on solid-state NMR, we also carried out the quantification using liquid state 7Li and 6Li NMR. On one hand, it should be easier to implement since internuclear and electron-to-nuclear interactions are averaged due to Brownian motion. On the other hand, the liquid-state 6,7Li NMR requires a complete extraction and dissolution of lithium from electrode samples with a complete loss of information associated with different phases of the corresponding materials.

            "text": "From the experimental point of view, both 7Li and 6Li solidstate NMR can be easily carried out using classical probes dedicated to CPMAS experiments. The 6Li nucleus, having a smaller gyromagnetic ratio and lower quadrupolar moment than 7Li, usually results in better-resolved spectra. However, the low natural abundance of the 6Li nucleus requires longer acquisition times for non-enriched samples. The main problem is to compare the integrals of 7Li and 6Li NMR signals. As a matter of fact, even if the measurements are performed on the same sample and the same NMR probe, at a given magnetic field (11.74 T in our case), the 7Li and 6Li NMR frequencies (Larmor frequencies) are 194.37 MHz and 73.6 MHz, respectively. This means that from an experimental point of view, the NMR probe has to be tuned and matched for each isotope in order to optimize the resonant circuit. It is known that such a circuit cannot deliver a linear response for a whole range of frequencies. Moreover the NMR signal is further filtered and amplified by electronic circuits. They are also not expected to have linear amplification in the whole NMR frequency range. These observations have been rationalized by different formulae describing the dependence on the signal-to-noise ratio, S/N, after a 901 pulse. Among the following options, one that has been very often used23 and extensively discussed is outlined in the excellent review of Doty et al.24\nS N \u00bc\nh2 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2pm0 p 12kb 3 2 \" # nsgIx\u00f0Ix \u00fe 1\u00de ffiffiffiffiffiffi T 2 p Ts ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi Tn \u00fe Tp p \" # \u00f0ZEZfQLVs\u00de 1 2o 3 2 (1)\nwhere %h is Plank\u2019s constant divided by 2p, m0 is the permeability of free space, kb is Boltzmann\u2019s constant, nS is the number of spins at resonance per unit volume, g is the gyromagnetic ratio, Ix is the spin quantum number, T 2 is the effective spin\u2013spin relaxation time, TS is the sample temperature, Tn is the probe noise temperature, TP is the effective preamp noise temperature, ZE is the RF efficiency, Zf is the filling factor of the resonant coil, QL is the quality factor of the matched circuit, VS is the sample volume, and o is the Larmor frequency, where o = gB0. 24\nThe above equation eqn (1) shows that it is impossible to perform direct quantitative comparison of 7Li and 6Li without signal-to-noise (S/N) calibration for each isotope. However, it can be done with sufficient precision by using a reference compound with known isotope abundance and with similar physical properties (magnetic susceptibility, permittivity, etc.). After that, for any samples to be analyzed, provided that the measurements on each Li isotope are carried out under identical conditions, the calculated 7Lis/n and\n6Lis/n ratios will depend only on the fraction of each isotope (ns value in eqn (1)). Indeed, as 6Li and 7Li NMR experiments are performed on the same sample using the same spectrometer, then Ts, Vs,\nB0 and Zf are equivalent for both isotopes. For each isotope, g and Ix, as well as h, m0 and kB are constants. Moreover, due to the proximity of physical properties of the reference and studied samples, the QL and T 2 factors also remain similar. Thus, the integral of measured NMR signals (int) of 6Li and 7Li will be, respectively, proportional to the amount (in %) of 6Li and 7Li nuclei:\nInt\u00f07Li\u00de Int\u00f06Li\u00de \u00bc S %7Li %6Li (2)\nwhere S defines the normalization factor. This relation allows calculating the isotopic ratio of any sample on the basis of the measured integrals. Note that the sum of %7Li and %6Li remains constant and is equal to 100%.\nIt is essential to remind that such a quantification is possible only if the acquisition conditions are optimized and kept constant: excitation pulse, acquisition delay (fulfilling a complete recovery of nuclear magnetization), tuning and matching of resonance circuit. Additionally, the number of scans (N) and the receiver gain (G) used to acquire NMR spectra with good quality can be easily taken into account: as a matter of fact, signal-to-noise ratios can be normalized by dividing the measured S/N ratio by G and N.25,26 Note that the mass of the material does not need to be taken into account since the 7Li and 6Li measurements are performed in the same MAS rotor."

The differences between 7Li and 6Li spectra are as expected. The signal-to-noise ratio for the 6Li NMR spectrum is lower compared to the 7Li NMR spectrum due to a lower gyromagnetic ratio and natural abundance of the 6Li isotope.

In contrast, for 6Li, the quadrupolar moment is lower and almost no spinning side band is observed. These features can be overcome by increasing the spinning rate for 7Li and/or by increasing the number of accumulated transients for 6Li (or otherwise by increasing the magnetic field intensity).\nBoth 6Li and 7Li NMR spectra show the presence of several spectral components. The NMR signal with the chemical shift value of B0 ppm is assigned usually to lithium atoms in the SEI. Two NMR lines near 19 and 6 ppm can be attributed to lithium in the Si bulk, namely to Li atoms nearby small Si clusters (stars, rings) and isolated Si, respectively. Indeed, similar signals were observed earlier for the stable alloys Li12Si7 and Li15Si4 with these characteristic local surroundings. 19,20 The first lithiation of crystalline Si is accompanied by the breaking of Si\u2013Si bonds. This process requires high energy and leads to the so-called \u2018\u2018core\u2013shell\u2019\u2019 mechanism of lithiation with a shell made of an amorphous LixSi phase (x = 2.8 0.3), surrounding the core of pristine crystalline Si.27,28 Taking it into account, it seems reasonable to associate the observed NMR signals near 19 and 6 ppm with Li atoms which are located in the bulk of the shell and with those found in the highly lithiated \u2018\u2018core\u2013shell\u2019\u2019 front, respectively.\nIt is of primary importance to check that the lithium isotope abundances in the sample and those in the counter electrode and electrolyte are alike. It has to be noted that there are some hypothetical phenomena, known as isotope fractionation, which could slightly modify this abundance leading to a small isotope enrichment of a component in one specific isotope. The preferential diffusion of one isotope over the other is an example of an isotope effect leading to isotope fractionation. Isotope fractionation generally leads to very small deviations from the natural ratio (parts per thousand)1,29 and can be neglected. In reversible systems like Li-ion cells, there is no opportunity to observe kinetic fractionation; though equilibrium lithium fractionation could exist. On the other hand, some reactions during SEI formation can be irreversible and could cause a slight isotope fractionation at the electrode surface. In order to clarify this point, ToF-SIMS analyses were performed at the electrode surface where SEI is mainly present. Fig. 3 shows the ToF-SIMS profile obtained for the reference electrode. The evolution of the 30Si fragment reflects that sputtering has been successful in probing the entire depth of the SEI and reaching the beginning of the bulk material as the 30Si moiety reaches a plateau. 7Li abundance measured is around 93% over the entire depth-profile. No isotope fractionation is observed. Thus, it can be concluded that 7Li isotope abundance in this electrode is 93% and this sample can be used as a reference. Using the normalized integrals of 7Li and 6Li NMR signals, which are 3435 and 26, respectively, and using eqn (2), we calculate the correction factor S to be equal to about 10.5. Note that all the NMR lines shown in Fig. 2 were taken into account, including spinning side bands. In order to go a step further, the deconvolution of the measured NMR spectra has been performed.\nAs shown in Fig. 4, they can be considered as a superposition of three components: two \u2018\u2018bulk\u2019\u2019 components, corresponding to lithium nearby isolated Si atoms (Li15Si4 in phase denomination) and lithium nearby Si clusters (Li12Si7), and Li atoms in the SEI with the characteristics presented in Table 1. It is clear from Table 1 that the proportions of each component (silicides and SEI) found in 7Li and 6Li NMR are alike within 3%, which reinforces the idea that there is no isotope fractionation detectable by NMR.

This simple experiment is the exact opposite of the one performed to get the reference sample. As previously mentioned, since isotopic fractionation is considered negligible, a value of 5% for the 7Li content in the silicon electrode is expected and observed. Using the S factor, calculations give a value of 4% for 7Li abundance. It clearly shows that the method we proposed can be applied for samples for which the isotopic ratio has to be determined. Let\u2019s note that here and further, different NMR signals are labeled and discussed as \u2018\u2018phases\u2019\u2019: Li12Si7, Li7Si3, Li13Si4 and Li15Si4. However, it is done just for the sake of simplicity and we rather refer to their typical local lithium surroundings. It has to be also noted that at this stage of the discussion, we restricted ourselves to only two Li12Si7 and Li15Si4 \u2018\u2018phases\u2019\u2019, which correspond to the lowest and the highest stages of silicon lithiation, respectively. However, a better fit of the spectra shown in Fig. 4 can be achieved if we include additional lines near 16 and 12 ppm. These signals correspond to lithium atoms with local coordinations consisting of Si dumbbells, and Si pairs and isolated atoms, respectively. They correspond to the \u2018\u2018intermediary\u2019\u2019 Li7Si3 and Li13Si4 phases if one use the above denomination.19,20 For further discussion (see below), we will use a larger set of lines during NMR spectra deconvolution."

Experiments described in experimental setups B, C and D are some examples. In this section, we would like to focus on the study of Li exchange between electrolyte, SEI and Si core particles using isotope tracing and NMR characterization. Li exchange occurring between the SEI and the electrolyte has been first shown in a SEI-model generated on a copper foil through ToF-SIMS experiments conducted by Peng Lu et al.2 Peng Lu and coworkers have interpreted their results as a permeation of the electrolyte in the first nanometers of the SEI combined with isotope exchanges in depth. From these results, the authors could infer the Li diffusion mechanisms in the SEI in their model setup. Beyond this aspect, this finding is important since it suggests that Li isotope exchange can take place between the liquid and solid media even when the system is at equilibrium, i.e. without any electrical potential. Our recent results also demonstrated that Li isotope exchanges can occur between the SEI of a delithiated graphite electrode and an electrolyte without any electric field.10 Such exchanges are fast and have a large amplitude as isotope distribution becomes homogeneous in less than 20 minutes of contact. In both studies, the methodology is the same: a nat-SEI is dipping in an enr-electrolyte. Note that ToF-SIMS allows the evolution of the 7Li/6Li ratio on the surface of the electrode.\nOur NMR technique is an efficient tool for studying homogeneous samples arranged in successive layers, such as a SEI film on substrate or delithiated graphite electrodes. However, the studied Si electrodes are not layered but rather porous materials, and the SEI can be found not only on the electrodes surfaces but also within their thickness. In this regard, NMR can be considered as a more powerful technique since it is able to investigate the whole sample volume.\nTo answer these addressed questions, a silicon-based electrode was lithiated against a Li metal counter electrode, where lithium isotope abundance was around natural (92.6% in 7Li\u20137.4% in 6Li) to a state of charge corresponding to 1000 mA h g 1. The silicon electrode was then recovered and dipped into a 6Li-enriched electrolyte (95% in 6Li) for 52 hours. These procedures correspond to experimental setup D (Fig. 1D). Fig. 5 shows the 7Li (a) and 6Li (b) NMR spectra of electrode powder at the end of the experiment. The results of spectra deconvolution are present in Table S1 in the ESI.\u2020 The corresponding isotopic ratios are reported in Table 3.

This confirms that silicide particles are also affected by the isotope exchange phenomenon, and its extent is high enough to be observed by NMR. The mean 7Li abundance determined using our methodology is 74%. This value is close to that obtained from electrochemical results (see the ESI,\u2020 calculation used for mass balance), yielding a 7Li concentration of 71% for the complete system, electrolyte + electrode, with the homogenization of a full isotope.\nHowever, the distribution of lithium isotopes in different phases is highly non-uniform: meanwhile for the SEI, Li13Si4 and Li15Si4 exhibit a\n7Li abundance of around 80 3%, while for Li12Si7, it does not exceed 50% (i.e. it is the most enriched in 6Li). The observation of 6Li fractionation in different LixSi silicides can be explained if we assume again that the lithium concentration increases with the shell depth: on the Si grain boundary, the Li environment is similar to that in the poorly lithiated Li12Si7, while for the deepest \u2018\u2018core\u2013shell\u2019\u2019 front, it is rather reminiscent of that for Li15Si4 (while the \u2018\u2018intermediary\u2019\u2019 phase Li13Si4 corresponds obviously to Li atoms in the shell depth). In this case, the difference in 6Li enrichment between different LixSi silicides can be determined by different lithium mobility in these phases. For instance, Dupke et al.8 have shown that lithium ions interacting with silicon clusters or dimers have generally higher mobilities than those surrounded by monomeric silicon atoms. Consequently, Li mobility becomes more and more limited according to the order: Li12Si7 - Li7Si3 - Li13Si4 - Li15Si4. 19\nAt first sight, the most intriguing finding is the high fraction of 7Li in the SEI. Considering that the SEI covers the silicon surface, the 6Li atoms must pass through this domain to reach the Si depth. From this point of view, one would expect a higher fraction of 6Li in the SEI. However, two phenomena have to be taken into account. The first one concerns lithium mobility.\nLithium diffusion coefficients are, respectively, estimated to be around 1.6 10 16 cm2 s 1 for Li2O; 3.5 10 16 cm2 s 1 for LiF; 1.1 10 11 cm2 s 1 for ROLi and 7 10 12 cm2 s 1 for ROCO2Li31,32 which are typical compounds found in the SEI,33 whereas the lithium diffusion coefficient in silicon is estimated to be 10 11 cm2 s 1.28,34,35 The second aspect to consider is that not all the silicon surface can be covered with the SEI. Indeed, the states of Si powder in electrochemical cycling (pressed and stuck to copper foil) and in our experiment (free powder dipped in a liquid electrolyte) are significantly different. In our case, new regions of the Si surface, previously inaccessible for direct contact with the electrolyte, may open up. Thus, the diffusion of 6Li in the Si depth can occur directly across the silicides grains bypassing the SEI.\nIn order to better understand the processes involved in lithium isotope exchange, an \u2018\u2018in situ\u2019\u2019 MAS NMR experiment was performed. For this, a few drops of a 6Li-electrolyte were added in a rotor filled with a 7Li-lithiathed electrode. Then, the NMR measurements were performed after only one hour of contact. NMR spectra, which correspond to 48 accumulated transients with a 4 s recycling delay, were acquired continuously with a 900 s delay between each spectrum. Fig. 6 displays the 7Li NMR spectra obtained during the sequential acquisition process.\nFig. 7 shows the deconvolution of 7Li MAS NMR spectra focusing solely on the central transition (the ssb parameters have been taken into account but are not shown in the figure for clarity). Fig. 8 presents the evolution of 7Li signal intensities (see Table S2, ESI\u2020) in different phases as a function of the soaking time with the 6Li 95% enriched electrolyte.\nIt is clear from these experimental data that the fractions of 7Li in the electrolyte do not vary significantly over time. If we consider the electrolyte as the only reservoir of 6Li, then the corresponding NMR signal should be the first to be modified if isotope exchanges take place. Therefore, we have to conclude that either the lithium isotope exchanges involving the liquid electrolyte and solid powder do not occur, or they have already taken place during the first non-monitored hour. To check it, the Tof-SIMS experiments have been performed. These data (see Fig. 9) clearly demonstrate that the \u2018\u2018liquid\u2013solid\u2019\u2019 isotope\nFig. 5 7Li (a) and 6Li (b) NMR spectra of the reference electrode dipped into a 6Li-electrolyte.

The percentage of 7Li decreases sharply from 93% to 55% during the first ten minutes over the entire depth probed, reflecting a diffusion of 6Li atoms at the surface of the electrode. Curiously, after 30 minutes of immersion, the percentage of 7Li rises to around 75% in the probed depth and to 65% at the surface (0 s of sputtering). Finally, after 60 minutes of immersion, the percentage of 7Li is around 75% for the entire depth probed. This can be explained by mutual 6,7Li diffusion, when 6Li atoms penetrate to deeper Si layers, while 7Li diffuses from the Si depth to the surface, until reaching the homogenized concentration.\nThe main changes in the 7Li fraction are found on the silicides surface: during 25 hours, the 7Li12Si7 phase completely disappears (Fig. 6\u20138), most likely due to the 6Li - 7Li replacement. This confirms our previous results and assumptions (see Fig. 5 and corresponding discussion). Interestingly, the\ndecrease in 7Li12Si7 phase intensity is accompanied by an increase in the 7Li fraction in the SEI, from about 32 to 38%. As in the case of ToF-SIMS data, this result allows assuming that besides 6Li - 7Li replacement, there is a simultaneous inverse process of 7Li - 6Li occurring between silicides and SEI compounds. It has to be noted also that in contrast to the outer part of the LixSi shell, the behavior of\n7Li fraction in deeper layers remains almost unchanged with soaking time. For the \u2018\u2018core\u2013shell\u2019\u2019 interface (which is represented as the Li15Si4 phase as shown in Fig. 8), it seems to be obvious. For the intermediary part of the shell, the situation is more\nFig. 7 Soaking experiment between a 6Li 95%-enriched electrolyte and a 7Li lithiated silicon-based electrode.

Fig. 7 presents one of the possible fits with two NMR lines corresponding to Li7Si3 and Li13Si4 phases. Within this representation with two separate \u2018\u2018intermediary\u2019\u2019 lines, the tendency to decrease the Li7Si3 phase amount is observed. Thus, 6Li penetration is observed in these layers of the LixSi shell. However, it has to be noted that the fit of NMR spectra in the range of chemical shifts around 15 ppm yields rather contradictory results. Due to their proximity, these NMR lines overlap each other. As a result, their parameters (shift, width, ssb distribution) can be changed in a substantially wide range and, consequently, their intensities also change within the large error bars. Therefore, it appears to be more reasonable to represent them as a whole \u2018\u2018Li7Si3 + Li13Si4\u2019\u2019 phase (as shown in Fig. 8 and in Table S2, ESI\u2020). Then it becomes clear that the 7Li fraction remains stable (within 2% of relative intensity) during entire soaking time. The center of mass of this merged NMR line moves in the region of lower chemical shifts, indicating, most likely, the 7Li atoms\u2019 diffusion in the deeper layers of the LixSi shell.\nThus, we can propose the \u2018\u2018two-stage\u2019\u2019 scenario of the 6Li\u20137Li isotope exchange in the 6Li-enriched liquid electrolyte\u20137Li lithiated Si electrode system. During the first 30 min, the fast \u2018\u2018liquid\u2013solid\u2019\u2019 exchange occurs, involving, most likely, both the silicide surface and the SEI. Then the 6Li atoms start to permeate Si bulk, replacing the 7Li ones, which in turn sink deeper in Si particles and/or diffuse in the SEI. This exchange process is much slower (occurs on the scale of tens of hours) and is most likely limited to only the outer part of the LixSi shell."

            "text": "A simple and easy-to-use methodology of lithium isotope titration by high-resolution magic angle spinning solid-state NMR has been proposed. A key point is the use of a reference sample that allows comparing 7Li and 6Li MAS NMR spectra for all acquisitions under the same conditions without the distortion of spectra. The spectra deconvolution makes it possible to determine the isotopes\u2019 ratio for each local chemical environment of the nucleus-probe. Therefore, in silicon-based electrode samples, it was possible to quantify 7Li/6Li for the SEI, electrolyte and different silicides.\nIn the second step, this method was applied to study the isotope exchanges appearing between a 7Li\u2013Si electrode in a partially lithiated state (1000 mA h g 1) and a 6Li-enriched electrolyte. The NMR results in combination with ToF-SIMS data demonstrate that Li isotope exchanges occur most likely due to a \u2018\u2018two-stage\u2019\u2019 mechanism. During the first hour of the electrode and electrolyte contact, the fast \u2018\u2018liquid\u2013solid\u2019\u2019 6Li\u20137Li exchange occurs, involving both the SEI and silicide surface. Then, these 6Li atoms start to permeate into the Si bulk, replacing the 7Li ones. This process is much slower and occurs on a scale of tens of hours.\nIt is worth noting that although in the present work we have considered the battery electrode materials as an example to\nillustrate our methodological approach, it can be applied in a wide range of systems, for example, to study the chemical reactions involving atomic exchanges such as those expected between different solid phases or in liquid\u2013solid reactions. The method proposed can be performed on standard MAS NMR equipment without involving any additional techniques."

At the end of cycling, the cells were disassembled in an argon filled glovebox. Silicon-based electrodes were taken off and washed by soaking in DMC during 1 minute.

Tuning of the probe has to be carried out when changing the observed nucleus. The Magic Angle Spinning method is used by setting the spinning rate at 10 kHz. The acquisition sequence used is direct excitation without proton decoupling using a 301 pulse, 2.5 ms and 2 ms for 6Li and 7Li, respectively. Dead times were set to 40 ms and 0.4 ms and recycling delays to 5.6 s and 0.66 s for 6Li and 7Li, respectively. At first sight, these recycling delays may appear to be too short. Indeed, rough estimates showed that in LixSi phases, the spin\u2013lattice relaxation time, T1, for the\n7Li nuclei was in the range of about 0.4 s which is close to the values obtained by Kuhn et al.36 Thus, the recycling delay of 0.66 s is much shorter than the \u2018\u2018classical\u2019\u2019 required 5T1. It has to be noted, however, that we deliberately choose the shortest possible value of repetition time in order to maximize the number of FID accumulations. We made sure that the shape of the 6Li and 7Li NMR spectra at given delays does not differ significantly from that obtained at longer repetition times. Other parameters such as the number of accumulated transients (NS) and receiver gain (RG) have to be taken into account for quantitative treatment (see the Results section)."
