 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Empirically test the theoretical predictions on how algorithm design and delegation decisions affect decision quality in real-world settings like healthcare, criminal justice, etc. This could involve field experiments that vary algorithm design and human involvement.

2. Extend the theoretical model to allow for more complex action spaces beyond binary choices. This could reveal new insights into optimal algorithm design and delegation for more nuanced decision problems. 

3. Incorporate behavioral models of human judgment and decision making into the theoretical framework, rather than assuming perfect Bayesian agents. This could lead to tailored algorithm designs that account for specific cognitive biases.

4. Study the effects of providing the agent with an explanation of the algorithm's prediction. How does explanation interact with the agent's biases and change the optimal information design?

5. Analyze the case where the principal can design the information structure of both the public and private signals to the agent. How does access to shaping the agent's private information change the results?
