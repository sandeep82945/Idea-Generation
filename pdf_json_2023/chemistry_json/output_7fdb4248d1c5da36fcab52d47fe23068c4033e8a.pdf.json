To overcome safety issues, liver failure, and problems associated with on-/offtargets, natural products due to their novel and unique structures offer promising alternatives as drug targets.\nMethods: In the current study, the Marine Natural Products, North African, South African, East African, and North-East African chemical space was explored for HIFPHD inhibitors discovery through molecular search, and the final hits were validated using molecular simulation and free energy calculation approaches.\nResults: Our results revealed that CMNPD13808 with a docking score of \u22128.690 kcal/mol, CID15081178 with a docking score of \u22128.027 kcal/mol, CID71496944 with a docking score of \u22128.48 kcal/mol and CID11821407 with a docking score of \u22127.78 kcal/mol possess stronger activity than the control N-[(4hydroxy-8-iodoisoquinolin-3-yl)carbonyl]glycine, 4HG (\u22126.87 kcal/mol). Interaction analysis revealed that the target compounds interact with Gln239, Tyr310, Tyr329, Arg383 and Trp389 residues, and chelate the active site iron in a bidentate manner in PHD2. Molecular simulation revealed that these target hits robustly block the PHD2 active site by demonstrating stable dynamics. Furthermore, the half-life of the Arg383 hydrogen bond with the target ligands, which is an important factor for PHD2 inhibition, remained almost constant in all the complexes during the simulation. Finally, the total binding free energy of each"

            "text": "Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a heterodimeric transcription factor that is made up of two helix-loop-helix proteins, HIF-\u03b1 and HIF-\u03b2. HIF is a prime controller for cellular oxygen homeostasis, whereas the prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzyme is a vital regulator for HIF-\u03b1 stability (Oh et al., 2015). Promoting the stability and function of HIF through PHD inhibition has been recommended as a potent medicinal approach for ischemic diseases, cancer-related fatigue, and other oxidative pathological disorders resulting from anemia (Wu et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2017). Under normoxia, HIF-\u03b1 has a comparatively short half-life (less than 5 min) and it quickly decomposes through the ubiquitinproteasome pathway. Both proline residues of human HIF-1\u03b1, Pro402, and Pro564, within its oxygen-degradation domain (ODD), undergo oxygen-dependent prolyl hydroxylation catalyzed by prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHD1, 2 and 3) in the presence of 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and Fe2+ ion (Chowdhury, 2017). Prolyl hydroxylation of HIF-\u03b1 then enhances its linking to the tumor suppressor protein called vonHippel-Lindau (pVHL), which is a fragment of the E3-ubiquitin composite, causing proteasomal degradation of HIF-\u03b1. On the other hand, \u00dfhydroxylation of HIF-1\u03b1 at its asparagine residue (Asn803) within the C-terminal transcriptional activation domain (C-TAD) is catalyzed by factor inhibiting HIF (FIH). This modification lowers HIF-\u03b1 bonding to coactivator p300-CBP proteins, rendering the inactivation of HIF transcriptional action (Hampton-Smith et al., 2019).\nUnder conditions of hypoxia, reduced oxygen levels inhibit the activity of PHDs, thus preventing HIF- \u03b1 prolyl hydroxylation and its degradation. Then, accumulated HIF-\u03b1 is translocated into the nucleus and forms heterodimer by binding to HIF-\u03b2, this subsequently leads to upregulation of HIF transcriptional pathways (He et al., 2012). Recent studies revealed PHD2 is a significant oxygen sensor and a major HIF-\u03b1 regulator, so considering its potency as a therapeutic target, most inhibitors were designed (Emmanuel et al., 2003; Ashok et al., 2017). Many of the reported PHD2 inhibitors compete with 2OG co-substrate to bind to its active site (Rosen et al., 2010; Pergola et al., 2016).\nMany PHD drug candidates have been investigated but some side effects and limitations such as liver failure and hypertension were also reported (Del Vecchio and Locatelli, 2018). Natural products which have novel and unique structures have been a principal source of drugs for many illnesses [11\u201313]. Exploration of the natural product chemical space provides an alternative way for the discovery of novel\nPHD drug candidates. The objectives of the current study are to discover novel potential inhibitors from Comprehensive Marine Natural Products (CMNPD), North African, East African, North-East African, and South African Natural Products databases to target PHD2 protein. The co-crystal structure of HIF-PHD2 was retrieved from a protein databank in a complex with N-[(4-hydroxy-8-iodoisoquinolin-3-yl) carbonyl]glycine (4HG). In the current study, 4HG was used as a positive control and the best compounds were subjected to molecular simulation and binding free energy calculations. Our potential shortlisted candidates that demonstrated promising activity against PHD2 need further in vitro and in vivo validation for the development of potential drugs against HIF-associated diseases."

Boeravinone D was originally isolated from Abronia nana and has previously been reported to have potent anti-oxidative, genoprotective, spasmolytic, and antibreast cancer effects (Park et al., 2014). Figure 3 shows the binding mode of CID15081178 in the PHD2 binding pocket. CID15081178 chelates the active site Fe2+ with its carbonyl and 11-hydroxyl oxygen while its 9-hydroxyl group interacts with Tyr329 and Arg383 via hydrogen bonding.\nThe bioactive alkaloid, 3-debromolatonduine B methyl ester (CID71496944) isolated from marine sponge Stylissa species, with the docking score of \u22128.48 kcal/mol, was the third hit compound identified from the East African Natural Products database (EANPDB) (Fouad et al., 2012, !!!

Furthermore, the amino group and carbonyl oxygen in its azepine-2-one ring and the amino group in its pyrrole ring could also form hydrogen bonding with Gln239, Tyr303, and Asp254, respectively.

RMSD is used to assess the stability of a protein over time and monitor changes in its structure. By comparing the RMSD values of a protein structure at different stages of a simulation, essential information can be obtained that causes changes in proteins in response to various conditions and make predictions about its behavior in real-world environments. Considering the higher importance of this approach in scaling the dynamic stability of a ligand-bound protein complex, we also used simulation trajectories to calculate the RMSD of each complex. As given in Figure 6A, the complex CMNPD13808-PHD2 demonstrated stable dynamic behavior. Initially, the RMSD increased during the first 10ns and an abrupt increase at 5 ns was reported for this complex. Then afterward the structure RMSD stabilized at 2.0 \u00c5 soon after reaching 8 ns With a uniform pattern, the complex reported an average RMSD of 1.96 \u00c5 which demonstrates a stable complex during the simulation. No significant perturbation was observed except a minor up and down between 70 and 80 ns. The RMSD overall demonstrates a stable behavior thus showing the imposed pharmacological behavior of the drug in the binding cavity. In the case of the CID15081178 -PHD2 complex, the RMSD was observed to be lower in contrast to the CMNPD13808-PHD2 complex. From the very beginning, an incline in the RMSD graph was observed, however, soon after reaching 1.75 \u00c5 at 15 ns the RMSD abruptly declined and continued to follow a stable uniform behavior with no significant perturbation. An average RMSD for this complex was calculated to be 1.45 \u00c5 which also implies the pharmacological potential of the drug in blocking the PHD2 active site. The RMSD pattern of the CID15081178 -PHD2 complex is given in Figure 6B. Furthermore, the CID71496944-PHD2 complex also demonstrated stable dynamics and showed similar pharmacological features by demonstrating stable dynamics when bound to the PHD2 active pocket. The RMSD reported an abrupt increase at the beginning and then stabilized at 1.5 \u00c5 with no significant dynamic structural perturbation until the end of the simulation. With minor deviations at 40, 65, and 88 ns this complex demonstrated favorable dynamic behavior till 200 ns An average RMSD was calculated to be 1.48 \u00c5. The RMSD pattern of the CID71496944PHD2 complex is given in Figure 6C. Despite the stable dynamics at the start of the simulation until 58 ns, a continuous increase in the RMSD pattern was observed for the rest of the simulation for the CID11821407-PHD2 complex. As shown in Figure 6D, despite the increase in the RMSD in the later part of the simulation, an average RMSD for this complex was calculated to be in an acceptable range of 1.49 \u00c5. Overall, the results strongly imply how these top-hit ligands strongly bind to the active pockets residues steered by hydrogen bonds and other contacts that are preserved during the simulation and instigate the pharmacological action by blocking the essential residues required for PHD2 functionality. These stable behaviors demonstrate pharmacological potential as the formation of stable complexes by these top-hit molecules may produce the desired therapeutic effects. Furthermore, all the complexes converged with each other, thus showing that they attained a similar atomic configuration during the simulation and satisfy the accuracy of the selected molecules. Consequently, these results may contribute to the development of new treatments for a wide range of diseases, including anemia, inflammation, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, strokes, spinal cord injury, and von Hippel\u2013Lindau disease-associated renal cell carcinoma mediated by HIF-PHD2."

In molecular simulations, the thermal motion of atoms in a protein structure is calculated as root mean square fluctuations (RMSF), which describe the deviation of a residue from its average position. RMSF can provide comprehension of the structural changes and the functionality of a protein. The flexibility index can be used to determine the proteinprotein interactions, molecular simulation, bio-catalytic mechanism, and mutational impacts and to design new drugs that target specific residues. This approach can also be used to understand the underlying mechanisms that direct the stability and dynamics of proteins (Grottesi et al., 2020).

The prominence of hydrogen bonding in protein-ligand complexes lies in its ability to strongly and specifically bind ligands\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org09\nto the targeted residues of a protein, which can have substantial pharmacological potential. Understanding and predicting the hydrogen bonding interactions between protein and ligand is, therefore, an important step in the development of new drugs and therapies (Khan et al., 2022b). Hence, we also calculated the total number of hydrogen bonds in each trajectory of the simulation. As given in Figures 9A\u2013D, the average number of hydrogen bonds in the CMNPD13808-PHD2 complex was calculated to be 128, in the CID15081178-PHD2 complex the average number of hydrogen bonds was calculated to be 126, in the CID71496944-PHD2 complex the average number of hydrogen bonds was also calculated to be 126, and, finally, in the CID11821407-PHD2 complex the average number of hydrogen bonds was calculated to be 124.\nIn molecular dynamics simulations, the half-life of hydrogen bonding refers to the amount of time that a hydrogen bond remains intact during a simulation. Monitoring the changes in the half-life of hydrogen bonds during a simulation can provide information regarding the specific interactions with other molecules (Khan et al., 2022a). Overall, the half-life of hydrogen bonding is an important aspect and provides valuable information regarding the pharmacological potential of a molecule. Herein, we also calculated the half-life of the hydrogen bond for each complex from the simulation trajectory. The hydrogen bond by Asp254 remained consistent in the CMNPD13808-PHD2 complex in 28% of the trajectory which makes 1,400 frames, in the CID15081178\\-PHD2 complex in 15% of the trajectory which makes 750 frames, in the CID71496944-PHD2 complex in 31% of the trajectory which makes 1,550 frames, and in the CID11821407PHD2 complex in 25% of the trajectory which makes 1,250 frames. The hydrogen bond by Tyr303 remained consistent in the CMNPD13808-PHD2 complex in 37% of the total trajectory which makes 1850 frames, in the CID15081178-PHD2 complex in 39% of the total trajectory which makes 1950 frames, in the CID71496944-PHD2 complex in 44% of the total trajectory whichmakes 2,200 frames, and in the CID11821407-PHD2 complex in 29% of the total trajectory which makes 1,540 frames.Moreover, the hydrogen bond byArg322 remained consistent in the CMNPD13808-PHD2 complex in 54% of the total trajectory which makes 2,700 frames, in the CID15081178-PHD2 complex in 48% of the trajectory which makes 2,400 frames, in the\nCID71496944-PHD2 complex in 34% of the total trajectory which makes 1700 frames, and in the CID11821407-PHD2 complex in 43% of the total trajectory which makes 2,150 frames. The hydrogen bond by Tyr303 remained consistent in the CMNPD13808-PHD2 complex in 37% of the total trajectory which makes 1850 frames, in the CID15081178-PHD2 complex in 39% of the total trajectory which makes 1950 frames, in the CID71496944-PHD2 complex in 44% of the total trajectory which makes 2,200 frames, and in the CID11821407PHD2 complex in 29% of the total trajectory whichmakes 1,540 frames. Furthermore, the half-life of the Arg383 hydrogen bond in the CMNPD13808-PHD2 complex was reported to be sustained in 73% of the total trajectory which makes 1850 frames, in the CID15081178PHD2 complex in 78% of the total trajectory whichmakes 1950 frames, in the CID71496944-PHD2 complex in 69% of the total trajectory whichmakes 2,200 frames, and in the CID11821407-PHD2 complex in 76% of the total trajectory which makes 1,540 frames. Finally, for Thr387, the half-life in the CMNPD13808-PHD2 complex was reported to be 21% of the total trajectory which makes 1,050 frames, in the CID15081178-PHD2 complex it was 25% of the total trajectory which makes 1,250 frames, in the CID71496944PHD2 complex it was 36% of the total trajectory which makes 1800 frames, and in the CID11821407-PHD2 complex it was 39% of the total trajectory which makes 1950 frames. Overall, the results show that the essential interaction remained consistent during the simulation for most of the time except Thr387 which is least important for inhibition. In particular, Arg383, which has been reported to play an important role in HIF-PHD2 functionally, was robustly blocked by these molecules with stable hydrogen bonding during the simulation. This shows the potential of these molecules to be tested and used as clinical candidates for the treatment of various diseases. The information regarding the half-life of hydrogen bonds with each active site residue is given in Table 2."

            "heading": "3.7 Binding free energy of the top hits",
            "text": "Binding free energy, i.e., MM/GBSA (Molecular Mechanics/ Generalized Born Solvent Accessible), is a quantification of the\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org10\nenergy necessary to bind two or more molecules into a specific binding configuration, and it is a key factor in comprehending the protein-ligand association. By taking into account both the energy required to bring the ligand and protein into a specific binding configuration and the changes in solvent-accessible surface area that occur during binding, the MM/GBSA technique offers a more accurate estimate of binding free energy. It also re-evaluates the docking conformation to determine the accuracy of the binding. In order to create novel drugs, binding free energy calculations are crucial since they offer a quantitative assessment of the potency of a particular binding interaction (Sun et al., 2014). Therefore, in the current study, we also calculated the binding free energy of each complex using the simulation trajectories. The van der Waals forces for these complexes were calculated as \u221257.41 kcal/mol for CMNPD13808-PHD2, \u221248.22 kcal/mol for CID15081178PHD2, \u221253.89 kcal/mol for CID71496944-PHD2, and \u221246.02 kcal/ mol for CID71496944-PHD2. The electrostatic energy for these complexes was calculated as \u221216.57 kcal/mol for CMNPD13808PHD2, \u221217.11 kcal/mol for CID15081178-PHD2, \u22129.32 kcal/mol for CID71496944-PHD2, and \u221214.55 kcal/mol for CID71496944PHD2. The EGB for these complexes was calculated as 14.22 kcal/ mol for CMNPD13808-PHD2, 10.15 kcal/mol for CID15081178PHD2, 11.21 kcal/mol for CID71496944-PHD2, and 13.78 kcal/mol for CID71496944-PHD2. The ESURF for these complexes were calculated as \u221213.15 kcal/mol for CMNPD13808-PHD2, -10.37 kcal/mol for CID15081178-PHD2, \u221216.47 kcal/mol for CID71496944-PHD2, and \u221215.27 kcal/mol for CID71496944-PHD2 (Table 3). The DELTA G gas for these complexes was calculated as \u221246.97 kcal/mol for CMNPD13808-PHD2,\u221243.25 kcal/mo for CID15081178-PHD2 l, \u221244.17 kcal/mol for CID71496944PHD2, \u221242.36 kcal/mol for CID71496944-PHD2. The DELTA G solvated for these complexes was calculated as 12.45 kcal/mol for CMNPD13808-PHD2, 11.25 kcal/mol for CID15081178-PHD2, 9.98 kcal/mol for CID71496944-PHD2, and 10.63 kcal/mol for CID71496944-PHD2. Finally, the total binding free energy for each complex was calculated as \u221272.91 kcal/mol for CMNPD13808-PHD2, \u221265.55 kcal/mol for CID15081178-PHD2, -68.47 kcal/mol for CID71496944-PHD2, and \u221262.06 kcal/mol for CID71496944-PHD2. These drugs possess relatively good activity compared with previously reported drugs and therefore are the best choice for clinical testing (Siddiq et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2017). Consequently, these four hits may inhibit PHD2 more strongly and need further in vitro and in vivo validation for possible usage as potential drugs against HIF-PHD2-associated diseases."

In the current study, the natural products chemical space was explored which revealed CMNPD13808, CID15081178, CID71496944, and CID11821407 as promising hits by targeting PHD2 active sites Gln239, Tyr310, His313, Asp315, Tyr329, Arg383, and Trp389 residues. The binding results revealed that the shortlisted hits demonstrated better interaction profiles in contrast to the positive control. Moreover, molecular simulation and binding free energy studies revealed that these\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org11\ndrugs possess relatively good activity in comparison with 4HG. The hydrogen bonding results further demonstrated that the essential interactions remained consistent during the simulation formost of the time except for Thr387 which is least important for inhibition. In particular, Arg383, which has been reported to play an important role in HIF-PHD2 functionally, was robustly blocked by these molecules with stable hydrogen bonding during the simulation. To conclude, these hits are potential clinical candidates but further in silico experiments such as metadynamics and free energy perturbation analysis, and in vitro and in vivo validations should be performed to determine the efficacy of these small molecules against HIF-PHD in various diseases."
