However, clinical trials to date have reported contradictory results. Different patient endotypes and variations in the type and dose of steroid may be at fault for this discrepancy, and further investigation is warranted. In this paper, we propose a new DEXA-SEPSIS study design.\nMethods We plan to conduct a multicenter, double-blinded randomized pilot study (DEXA-SEPSIS) investigating the feasibility and safety of early use of dexamethasone in sepsis. Participants will be high-risk septic patients presenting to the emergency department with a systolic blood pressure of <90 mmHg or serum lactate level of >2 mmol/L. Participants will be randomized to the following three groups: control, 0.1 mg/kg of dexamethasone, or 0.2 mg/kg of dexamethasone per day for 1 to 2 days. The primary outcome will be 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes will include time to septic shock, shock reversal, additional steroid administration, number of ventilator-free days, use of continuous renal-replacement therapy, length of stay in the intensive care unit and/or hospital, delta Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score on days 3 and 7, superinfection, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypernatremia, and hyperglycemia.\nDiscussion The DEXA-SEPSIS study will provide insight regarding the feasibility and safety of early use of dexamethasone in high-risk sepsis. The results could provide data to design a future phase III study.\nTrial registration ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05136560\nKeywords Dexamethasone; Glucocorticoids; Sepsis\nClin Exp Emerg Med 2022;9(3):246-252 https://doi.org/10.15441/ceem.22.276\neISSN: 2383-4625\nStudy Protocol\nReceived: 7 February 2022 Revised: 30 March 2022 Accepted: 30 March 2022\nCorrespondence to: Kyuseok Kim Department of Emergency Medicine, CHA Bundang Medical Center, CHA University School of Medicine, 59 Yatap-ro, Bundang-gu, Seongnam 13496, Korea E-mail: dremkks@cha.ac.kr\nCo-correspondence to: Tae Gun Shin Department of Emergency Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, 81 Irwon-ro, Gangnam-gu, Seoul 06351, Korea E-mail: taegunshin@skku.edu\nHow to cite this article: Choi K, Park JE, Kim A, Hwang S, Bae J, Shin TG, Kim K.

            "text": "Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening type of organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated host responses to infection.1 Worldwide, it has high incidence and mortality rates and has become a public health problem.2-4 Given these characteristics, the World Health Organization has announced sepsis management to be a global health priority.5 Many drugs have been developed for treating sepsis, but none to date have shown clinical efficacy. Low-dose steroids are recommended by current guidelines in cases of septic shock requiring ongoing vasopressor therapy, but the evidence in support of this approach is weak.6 A survey of the available studies covering the effects of steroids in sepsis reveals that steroid dose, sepsis severity (as manifested by the mortality rate of the control group), and timing of steroid administration have varied between them. Steroids may be beneficial in patients with a higher baseline mortality rate7,8 compared to those with a relatively lower mortality rate. Concomitantly, considering the immunosuppressant nature of steroids, they may actually be harmful when administered in the immunosuppressant phase of sepsis, i.e., usually the late phase of sepsis. Therefore, steroids could be more effective as early therapeutics. Historically, high-dose steroids have been used to treat sepsis, but no ultimate survival gains have been reported in the literature as a result of this approach.9-11 Subsequently, low-dose steroids were advocated for, but, in recent years, large and well-designed clinical trials have offered contradictory results,8,12 raising questions about the utility of steroids in septic shock. One metaanalysis has advocated for using a dose of steroids (200\u2013400 mg of hydrocortisone per day), which contrasts with the current guideline in sepsis.13 This dose could be converted to 8 to 16 mg of dexamethasone; in patients weighing 80 kg, the dose would be 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg. In addition, there is a small-sized randomized controlled trial that adopted a higher steroid dosage (0.2 mg/kg of dexamethasone) in sepsis than that used in the guideline, and the results favored steroid use, but the study lacked a group taking a routine\ndose of steroid.14 In one animal study, the administration of 0.2 or 5 mg/kg of dexamethasone improved the survival rate more significantly than 0.1 mg/kg of dexamethasone.15 Dexamethasone has only anti-inflammatory effects and has a longer half-life, which makes it easier to use in the emergency department. Moreover, another meta-analysis suggested that dexamethasone has the best therapeutic efficacy among various steroids.13\nConsidering these results, we hypothesized that the effect of steroids on sepsis might differ according to the steroid dosage and the severity and phase of sepsis. In a pilot study investigating the validity of this hypothesis, we plan to assess the effect of early bolus administration of different doses of dexamethasone in highrisk septic patients."

Data will also be presented stratified by center and the severity of septic shock according to the use of vasopressors. The statistical analysis will be performed by an independent and blinded statistician. Descriptive data will be presented using median and interquartile range values or mean\u00b1standard deviation values, as appropriate. Treatment groups will be compared using the chi-squared test, Fisher exact test, Student t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, one-way analysis of variance, or Kruskal-Wallis test with post-hoc analysis. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve with the log-rank test will be used in the time-to-event analysis. Multiple testing corrections will be performed with the Bonferroni method. Since this is a phase IIa study, a sample size calculation will not be required. The sample size would be 102 patients, considering a dropout rate of 10% and allocation of 30 patients to each group. P<0.05 will be considered statistically significant, and all statistical analyses will be two-sided. All analyses will be performed using R ver. 3.6.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and Stata ver. 17.0 (StataCorp., College Station, TX, USA)."

            "text": "The current guideline about sepsis suggests using intravenous corticosteroids for adults with septic shock and an ongoing requirement for vasopressor therapy.6 However, it also noted that the optimal dose, timing of initiation, and duration of corticosteroids remain uncertain. The use of dexamethasone is recommended in patients with COVID-19 or bacterial meningitis without the use of vasopressor therapy and in those with postoperative nausea and vomiting as a single bolus. Given these facts, we propose the use of dexamethasone in the early phase of high-risk sepsis\nin patients not on vasopressor therapy, which is the motive behind conducting this study. The results of this phase II study could lead to the design, development, and conduct of a phase III trial powered to evaluate the effects of the use of early dexamethasone in high-risk sepsis patients."
