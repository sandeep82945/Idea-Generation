    "abstractText": "Micro-light-emitting diodes (micro-LEDs) have been regarded as the important nextgeneration display technology, and a comprehensive and reliable modeling method for the design and optimization of characteristics of the micro-LED is of great use. In this work, by integrating the electrical simulation with the optical simulation, we conduct comprehensive simulation studies on electrical and optical/emission properties of real InGaN-based flip-chip micro-LED devices. The integrated simulation adopting the output of the electrical simulation (e.g., the non-uniform spontaneous emission distribution) as the input of the optical simulation (e.g., the emission source distribution) can provide more comprehensive and detailed characteristics and mechanisms of the micro-LED operation than the simulation by simply assuming a simple uniform emission source distribution. The simulated electrical and emission properties of the micro-LED were well corroborated by the measured properties, validating the effectiveness of the simulation. The reliable and practical modeling/simulation methodology reported here shall be useful to thoroughly investigate the physical mechanisms and operation of micro-LED devices.",

            "text": "Ever since Jiang et al. delivered the first III-nitride blue micro-light-emitting diodes (micro-LEDs) in the year of 2000, research on micro-LED displays has become increasingly attractive and promising [1,2]. In contrast to liquid-crystal displays (LCD) and organic light-emitting-diode displays (OLEDs), micro-LED displays provide potential merits such as high brightness, high luminous efficiency, high dynamic range, long lifetime, short response time, low power consumption, and wide color gamut. The display applications of micro-LEDs could range from large high-performance TVs and mobile/portable devices to wearable devices for augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and smart watches. As a result, micro-LED displays have been now regarded as one of the important next-generation display technologies. To develop high-performance micro-LEDs for displays, some issues and factors critical for micro-LED performance, such as: (i) current spreading, current crowding, and bulk/surface Shockley\u2013Read\u2013Hall recombination that would influence the carrier/emission distribution and internal quantum efficiency (IQE), and (ii) total internal reflection (TIR) loss inside the micro-LED chips that would affect the light extraction/luminous intensity/external quantum efficiency (EQE), require careful study and treatment. There have been some previous simulation studies investigating the physical mechanisms and operating behaviors of micro-LEDs [3\u20136]. Some works focused on the study and optimization of electrical properties [3,4], while some others paid attention to optical loss/light extraction properties [5,6]. Only a few studies considered/integrated both electrical and optical\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 9. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi14010009 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 9 2 of 15\nsimulation of micro-LED chips simultaneously to give more complete and comprehensive views of micro-LED characteristics [7]. However, it is known that the current/carrier distributions and surface recombination phenomena inside the micro-LED mesa would influence the distribution of the spontaneous emission rate over the lateral active region and lead to an inhomogeneous emission distribution over the chip area. Nevertheless, many works have simply assumed a uniform emission distribution over the active region in the optical studies/simulation of micro-LEDs, which might lead to a deviation from the actual situations/characteristics (either chip-surface emission intensity distribution or far-field emission characteristics). Consequently, it would be more ideal and comprehensive to consider/integrate both the electrical and optical simulation of micro-LED chips simultaneously to obtain more a complete and comprehensive view and understanding of micro-LED characteristics. In this work, we conduct comprehensive simulation studies, integrating the electrical simulation with the optical simulation, on real micro-LED devices and corroborate simulation results with experimental characteristics. The reliable and practical modeling/simulation methodology reported here shall be useful to thoroughly investigate the physical mechanisms and operation of micro-LED devices."

            "text": "The simulation studies were based on real fabricated blue GaN micro-LED devices/chips, as illustrated in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1a, the rectangular flip-chip GaN microLEDs transferred and solder-bonded onto the substrate having metal interconnection bus electrodes had a size of 450 \u00b5m2 and a chip thickness of ~4.7\u20135 \u00b5m [5]. The sapphire substrates had been removed from the micro-LED chips by the lift-off process. The GaN micro-LEDs were grown on the pattered sapphire substrate (PSS), thus giving a textured chip surface after substrate lift-off (Figure 1a). Figure 1a further depicts the cross-sectional layer structure of the micro-LED chips. Epi-layers consisted of a ~0.3 \u00b5m p-GaN layer, a 0.02\u20130.05 \u00b5m p-AlGaN electron-blocking layer (p-EBL), ~0.2 \u00b5m InGaN multiple-quantumwell (MQW) active layers, and a ~4\u20135 \u00b5m n-GaN layer [3,8\u201311]. To expose the n-GaN for making n-contacts, a smaller mesa region containing the p-GaN/MQWs/partial nGaN was formed by etching. The indium tin oxide (ITO) in contact with the p-GaN layer served as the current spreading layer for enhancing the electric conductivity and current spreading over the device [12]. The micro-LED chip was encapsulated with a thin SiO2 layer for passivation and for insulation to reduce electrical leakage [13]. Finally, the metal was applied (through openings in SiO2) as the p-contact to ITO/p-GaN and the n-contact to n-GaN [14]. The GaN micro-LED chips were transferred and solder-bonded onto the substrate having metal interconnection bus electrodes. The various sidewalls of the microLED chips had a taper angle of 110 \u00b1 10\u25e6 relative to the chip surface (Figure 1a) [5]. The PSS-induced surface texture had the concave shape of ~\u00b5m scale [15,16]. In addition to bare micro-LED chips bonded onto the substrate, even more practical/realistic microLED samples with a further encapsulation overcoat (OC, tens of micrometers thick over the micro-LED/substrate), as illustrated in Figure 1b, were also prepared and studied. Overall, two different micro-LED devices: (i) bare-surface-textured micro-LED without OC (Figure 1a), and (ii) surface-textured micro-LED with OC (Figure 1b), were analyzed in this study. The electrical modeling/simulation was conducted using the semiconductor module of the FEM (finite element method)-based multiphysics simulation software COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae of COMSOL Inc., while the optical modeling/simulation was conducted using the Monte Carlo ray-tracing-based software LightTools\u00ae of Synopsys Inc. The 3D electrical modeling/simulation of the micro-LED device was performed with the COMSOL semiconductor module, which solves device equations (Poisson\u2019s equations, current discontinuity equation, carrier transport equation, and photon emission rate equation) based on the finite volume method. For most of the simulation, the operating temperature was mainly assumed at room temperature (300 \u25e6K). Considering large aspect ratios between the\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 9 3 of 15\nlength, width, and height in the micro-LED layer stack and chip geometry studied, instead of using the default mesh geometry (tetrahedral mesh), it would be more effective to adopt the swept meshing technique (as illustrated in Figure 2) in the numerical simulation [10]. In the swept meshing, a boundary of quadrilateral meshes with a size of ~300 nm was first constructed as the source surface and the opposite targeted surface was specified. Then, an ample number of layers was set according to the thickness of the designated domain. Subsequently, the hexahedral elements were formed/arranged in order through the swept meshing. By means of the mesh optimization, the swept meshing technique not only reduces the number of meshes (compared with the default tetrahedral mesh), but also enables numerical solutions to reach convergence more effectively (e.g., with reasonable/reduced computing resource and time).

In general, RAuger is more significant at the high current\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 9 5 of 15\ndensities, while RSRH is dominant at the low current densities (thus, under general operating conditions of micro-LED devices). In view of the high perimeter-to-area ratios of microLEDs, the trap-assisted surface non-radiative recombination occurring at mesa surfaces was also considered [3], setting the trap levels 0.46 eV above the valence band and 0.24 eV below the conduction band [25], and setting the surface recombination velocities (SRVs) for both electrons and holes (vs,n and vs,p, respectively) around 1000 cm/s (Table 1) [13]. Through electrical simulation under different biases, the spatial distributions of carrier concentrations, current flows, various recombination rates, and spontaneous emission rates as a function of bias, J\u2013V characteristics, and electroluminescence (EL) and IQE as a function of bias can be analyzed. From the electrical modeling/simulation, the (three-dimensional) distributions of current flows, carriers, recombination, and spontaneous emission in the micro-LED device under different biases can be visualized. With the spatial (non-uniform) distribution of radiative recombination rates (spontaneous emission rates) calculated from the electrical modeling/simulation by COMSOL, the data were transformed into a matrix corresponding to locations over the MQW active region and were then used to set-up the spatial light source distributions over the MQW active region for optical modeling/simulation in LightTools. At each location, the s-polarized and p-polarized light sources were established separately with isotropic and cos2\u03b8 angular distributions and the total radiation power ratio of 3:1 (s vs. p polarization), respectively [26]. In addition, the total radiation powers (sum of s and p polarizations) and, thus, the total light ray numbers over locations were determined by the spatial distribution of the spontaneous rates over the active region calculated by the COMSOL. Overall, the effects of polarization, angular distribution, and spatial distribution were all taken into account in our optical simulation model. As the optical microcavity effects in the microLED configuration had been reported to be weak and relevant micro-LED dimensions (sizes, thicknesses, etc.) were larger than emission wavelengths [5], the optical modeling/simulation was conducted by the 3D Monte Carlo ray-tracing method, using the Synopsys LightTools software. Table 2 lists refractive indices and extinction coefficients at the emission wavelength of 459 nm for various materials/layers used in the optical simulation [5]. The small but not negligible extinction coefficient of the MQW layers would induce absorption loss upon propagation and multiple reflections of light. Tens of millions of rays propagating from the MQW emission region through multilayers and interfaces were calculated according to Snell\u2019s law and Fresnel equations. A planar receiver was placed 20 nm above the micro-LED sample surface to detect the normal-direction surface emission intensity distribution in correspondence with the measurement setup, while a large (infinite) sphere far-field receiver was used to observe/collect the far-field emission characteristics such as the light out-coupling/extraction efficiencies and emission patterns. The emission patterns were represented by the emission intensity as a function of the polar angle \u03b8 under various azimuthal angles \u03c6, in which \u03c6 = 0\u25e6 and \u03c6 = 90\u25e6 correspond to the long axis and short axis of the micro-LED chip (see Figure 1c), respectively. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) \u03b7EQE in general can be expressed as:\n\u03b7EQE = \u03b7CIE \u00d7 \u03b7IQE \u00d7 \u03b7LEE, (4)\nwhere \u03b7CIE is current injection efficiency, \u03b7IQE is internal quantum efficiency, and \u03b7LEE is light extraction efficiency [3]. For verification of optical simulation, simulation results were compared with the experimental measurements. The current-density\u2013voltage (J\u2013V) characteristics of the devices were measured by a source-measurement unit (Keithley 2400 SourceMeter, Tektronix Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA). The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of devices were determined by collecting the total emission fluxes with a calibrated spectral lamp measurement system (model SLM-12, AMA Optoelectronics Inc., Taoyuan, Taiwan), including a 12\u201d integrating sphere, a spectrometer (VNIR1010, Isuzu Optics Corp., Hsinchu, Taiwan), and a source meter (Agilent E3632A, Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). Angle-dependent EL properties (e.g., far-field emission patterns) of the devices were measured by a goniometric spectroradiometer (DMS 201, Autronic-Melchers GmbH,\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 9 6 of 15\nKarlsruhe, Germany). The emission intensity distributions over the micro-LED sample surface were observed using an optical microscope (MX50, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a CMOS sensor (SR-5100, Topcon corporation, Tokyo, Japan).\nTable 2.

Both simulation approaches can more or less predict or reproduce optical effects induced by the chip geometries and material optical properties (e.g., re-direction out-coupling by tapered sidewalls, surface textures, and reflection by the metal electrodes). Yet, the simple optical model adopting the uniform emission source distribution fails to simulate some non-uniform emission characteristics over the MQW mesa area (e.g., those associated with different driving current density or non-radiative surface recombination), while the model adopting the emission source distribution input from the electrical modeling/simulation can better reproduce such characteristics. For instance, the optical model with the electrical simulation input can simulate weaker emission around the center of the MQW mesa at the low current density and stronger/more uniform emission around the center of the MQW mesa at the higher current density. Such results clearly indicate that the integration of both electrical and optical simulation is useful to provide more detailed and comprehensive characteristics and mechanisms of the micro-LED operation."

Through the electrical modeling/simulation, electrical properties, such as J\u2013V characteristics, carrier, current, and spontaneous emission rate distributions, and internal quantum efficiencies, were first calculated. The output of the electrical simulation (e.g., the non-uniform spontaneous emission distribution) was then adopted as the input of the optical simulation (e.g., the emission source distribution) for further calculating optical/emission properties, such as light extraction efficiency, external quantum efficiency, and far-field and intensity distribution profiles. It was found that such an integrated simulation approach can provide more comprehensive and detailed characteristics and mechanisms of the micro-LED operation than the optical simulation by simply assuming a simple uniform emission source distribution. The simulated electrical and emission properties of the micro-LED were well corroborated by corresponding measured properties, validating the effectiveness of the overall simulation methodology. The reliable and practical modeling/simulation methodology reported here, thus, shall be useful to thoroughly investigate the physical mechanisms and operation of micro-LED devices.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, C.-C.L., C.-W.H., C.-L.H., and C.-C.W.; simulation, C.C.L., C.-W.H., and P.-H.L.; sample preparation, C.-W.H., C.-L.H., Y.-H.H., and K.-H.L.; measurements, C.-W.H., C.-L.H., and Y.-H.H.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, C.-C.L. and C.-C.W.; writing\u2014 review and editing, C.-C.L., C.-W.H., C.-C.W., Y.-H.H., and K.-H.L.; project administration, K.-H.L. and C.-C.W.
