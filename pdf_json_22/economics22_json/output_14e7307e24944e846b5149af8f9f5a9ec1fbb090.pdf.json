    "abstractText": "This paper uses Chinese provincial panel data from 2011 to 2019, measures CO2 emissions of provinces in China using the IPCC method, and explores the impact of digital finance on CO2 emissions through the SAR model and SDM. Empirical study shows that digital finance significantly reduces CO2 emissions. Digital finance reduces CO2 emissions by promoting energy industrial structure transformation and spreads to surrounding areas through spillover effects, contributes to increasing green patents granted and thus reduces regional CO2 emissions, advances the green technological progress and therefore inhibits CO2 emissions, but reduces the green technological progress in surrounding areas and increases CO2 emissions due to the siphon effect. With the development of digital finance itself, the higher the level of financial regulation, green development and the green finance index, the better the effect of digital finance on CO2 emission reduction. Additionally, digital finance significantly reduces CO2 emissions in the south of China.",

            "text": "The increase in global extreme weather in recent years has resulted in serious damages to the economic and social development of countries around the world. The International Panel on Climate Change has pointed out that the increasing global anthropogenic greenhouse gases emissions (GHGs), especially carbon dioxide, have led to many environmental problems including global warming [1], which has been one of the major challenges for human well-being [2,3]. The International Panel on Climate Change has pointed out that the increasing global carbon emissions have led to many environmental problems including global warming [4]. As the world\u2019s largest developing country and second largest economy, since the implementation of the \u201cReform and Opening-up\u201d policy in 1978, China has made significant progress in the aspects of economic growth, industrialization and social progress. However, according to the Global Carbon Atlas (GCA), The CO2 emissions in China increased from 1455 million tons in 1978 to 10,175 million tons in 2019, making it the world\u2019s highest emitter since it overtook the United States in 2006. The current stage of China\u2019s economic developing mode that relies on the extensive input of material capital and labors determines its energy consumption structure and carbon emissions. However, as the largest carbon dioxide-emitting economy in the world, China\u2019s process of peak carbon emissions plays an important role in limiting global temperature rise [5]. Under this circumstance, according to the intended nationally determined contributions (INDC), the Chinese government announced its commitment to attain the CO2 emissions peak around\nInt. J.

Given the significant impact of carbon emissions on global climate change and human social activities, the Chinese government committed to the US\u2013China Joint Communique on Climate Change issued in November 2014 to peak and stop growing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil energy combustion activities such as coal, oil, and natural gas; industrial production processes; as well as land use change and forestry by 2030. At the general debate of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly, President Xi Jinping also proposed that China will improve the nationally determined contributions and adopt tougher policies and measures to strive to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. Facing such great pressure from CO2 emission reduction, since the mode of Chinese carbon reduction was proposed, it immediately received a lot of attention from the international and domestic communities. In the meanwhile, at present, artificial intelligence, big data, and the blockchain are increasingly applied in the modern industrial system, which not only contribute more and more importantly to economic growth, but also greatly improve people\u2019s quality of life. In the process of forming the modern economic system, financial support guided by the development of digital finance also plays a pivotal role [7]. Digital finance has significantly expanded the scope of financial coverage, lowered the threshold and cost of financial services, and increased the efficiency of financial services [8]. Over the past decade, digital finance business in China has grown by leaps and bounds, contributing to not only economic growth, but also various aspects of economic development, including greenhouse gas emissions reduction [9]. Through upgrading the industrial structure, digital finance significantly reduces industrial pollution [10] and carbon emissions [11], alleviates financial constraints and increases R&D investment, improves the efficiency of green investment [12], enhances regional agricultural green total factor productivity [13] and the level of regional openness to the outside world, benefits the coordination of regional development, and promotes high-quality development [14]. Overall, there has been plenty of research on carbon emissions and digital finance as well as their relationships. However, most of the existing literature does not distinguish between physical and chemical changes in energy consumption; it conducts CO2 emissions accounts through the numerical value of energy consumption, which tends to overestimate emissions. Additionally, a lot of literature has studied the relationship between digital finance and carbon emissions, but there is a lack of research that identifies the causality between digital finance and carbon emissions excluding endogeneity and examining the mechanism from a spatial perspective. Therefore, this paper shifts the perspective to adopt more accurate indicators and qualitative parameters to measure carbon emissions. At the same time, this paper conducts causal inferences on whether digital finance effectively suppresses regional carbon emissions, which takes issues such as endogeneity and so on into consideration under the spatial perspective, and further explores the mechanisms of digital finance affecting carbon emission reduction under the spatial perspective, as well as the heterogeneity of digital finance on carbon emissions in terms of the different regions, digital finance itself, financial regulation, and green development as well as green finance development. The in-depth study of these issues will help us seek the channel of financial support for peak carbon dioxide emissions and test the role of digitalization on financial development, so as to provide recommendations for decision-making on the development of digital finance and help to peak carbon dioxide emissions in the context of the digital economy."

Developing finance is a reliable path to achieving carbon emission reduction [15]. Digital finance, referring to the financial business carried out by banks, other traditional financial institutions, and Internet enterprises using digital technology [16], leads to the profound transformation of financial mode that enables businesses to access financial services through digital channels [17]. The greatest advantage of digital finance is the use of innovative technology such as information technology, big data technology, and cloud computing to reduce financial transaction costs, expand the scope of financial services, and improve financial accessibility [18], which has played a significant role in sustainable development [19] and low-carbon emission reduction [20]. However, high-tech enterprises with low energy consumption and the technological innovation on which they depend are characterized by high investment, long research periods, and uncertainty [21], coupled with information asymmetry [22]. Here, commercial banks affirm loans for technological innovations as riskier when evaluating. At the same time, commercial banks tend to avoid high-risk projects due to regulations that require them to be risk-averse, which makes it difficult for enterprises to obtain loans for technological innovation projects, thus inhibiting technological innovations. Digital finance, relying on a large amount of individual behavior data and other information precipitated by lenders on the Internet, can build credit evaluation models by means of big data analysis [23], and alleviate the financial constraints of enterprises [24], especially in the sectors of emerging industry with low carbon emissions, through risk assessment of big data [25]. On the other hand, the regulatory risk requirements of Internet financial platforms are not strict as those of banks. Thus, they can do better in evaluating the credit and future profitability of these technological innovation behaviors and undertake a higher risk than banks when providing lending to these enterprises. Thus, they can obtain funds for debt financing, so as to promote the green technology innovations of enterprises. Therefore, digital finance has greatly alleviated the financial constraints of enterprises, stimulated green technological innovation behaviors [26], and assisted enterprises with CO2 emissions reduction. As the essential micro-component of regional market participation, the reduction of enterprises\u2019 CO2 emissions would help to suppress regional carbon emissions to a great extent. Accordingly, this paper puts forward the following hypothesis:\nH1. Digital finance alleviates the financial constraints of enterprises, thus reducing regional CO2 emissions."

Digital finance provides important support for the development of low-energy-consumption industries and the transformation of the energy industrial structure. Traditional energy-intensive industries are mostly stateowned enterprises with large scale, which can obtain loans through their high mortgage assets in the financial system with banking as the main financial intermediary participants, while enterprises devoted to green technological innovations and their innovative projects are excluded by the traditional financial system, making it difficult for enterprises to develop and land the projects. By alleviating the financial constraints of green innovative enterprises and projects, digital finance helps the development of relatively small-scale green technological innovative [26] so as to improve the output ratio of regional lowenergy-consumption industries, improve the efficiency of capital investment, strengthen the function of capital allocation, promote the transformation of funds to low-energyconsumption and high-efficiency industries, eliminate backward industries, optimize the reallocation of funds among industries, and promote the transformation of regional energy industrial structures, so as to achieve the goal of reducing carbon emissions.

            "text": "Viewing the process of global carbon emission reduction, the reasons why some countries realize the peak carbon dioxide emissions and carbon neutrality faster is that they are more energy efficient and developed in innovative low-carbon technology. Reducing carbon emissions requires strong innovation capacity. Therefore, achieving technological innovation is one of the most important ways of achieving carbon emission reduction [27]. Accelerating the technological progress of industries and promoting green innovations are vital for reducing carbon emissions. Finance will undoubtedly provide the necessary funding for the innovative behaviors upon which technological advancement depends. Through investing in high-quality innovative industries, finance is considered one of the most important factors in promoting sustainable economic development [28]. The excellent information collection and processing capability of digital finance can provide better play to the functions of filtering and screening information as well as evaluating risks, so that it can help mitigate information asymmetry [22]. Relying on digital technologies such as cloud computing, big data, and mobile Internet, the risk control, information processing, and monitoring systems that digital financial platforms depend on could efficiently and accurately mine and collect the credit and investigation data of funding demanders. By giving full play to digital advantages, digital finance helps to build a credit evaluation model and a more comprehensive credit investigation system, breaks through the limitations of traditional finance, mitigates information asymmetry between credit providers and demanders, and improves information transparency. By widely absorbing financial resources in the market, digital finance would convert them into accurate and effective information and data, reducing the financing costs of innovative behaviors and technological progress as well as solving the financing troubles of innovative subjects. Longterm and high-risk green projects could receive much-needed financial support, which would improve the utilization efficiency of resources [11], so as to support the development of green innovative behaviors and technological progress, thus reducing carbon emissions through green innovation and technological progress.

Accounting Method\nAccording to the carbon dioxide emissions accounting methods provided in the Guidelines for the Preparation of Provincial Greenhouse Gas Inventories and the Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories of the IPCC, the calculation method for CO2 emissions is shown in the following formula:\nPCi = \u2211ijMij \u00d7 EFi (1)\nwhere PC stands for carbon dioxide emissions, i stands for the subscript of the province, j stands for the subscript of the energy type, M stands for energy consumption, and EF stands for the carbon emissions factor.\n3.1.2. Emission Factors\nThe calculation formula for the carbon emissions factor is as follows:\nEFij = Cj \u00d7 Oij \u00d7 44/12 (2)\nwhere C represents the carbon content; O represents the carbon oxidation rate of the energy source. Due to the slightly different energy sources and accounting boundaries of power industry carbon accounting in different regions, the energy carbon oxidation rate is different in different regions, so the baseline carbon emissions factors of the power grid are different.\n3.1.3. Carbon Content\nThe calculation formula for carbon content is as follows:\nCj = NCVj \u00d7 Hj (3)\nwhere NCV represents the low calorific value of generation of fuel j; Hj represents the carbon content per unit calorific value of fuel j. The carbon content per unit calorific value and carbon oxidation rate of various energy sources refer to the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, and the default values of carbon content and oxidation rate in are expressed as calorific value units. Therefore, it is necessary to convert the physical amount consumed by various energy sources into the corresponding average low calorific value according to the default value of net heating given in the guide. The default values of average low calorific value are carbon content per unit, calorific value, and the carbon oxidation rate of various energy sources.

This paper conducts Moran index tests for spatial correlation between the digital financial inclusion index and CO2 emissions. Table 1 reports the results of spatial correlation tests. Where the spatial weighted matrix includes the provincial adjacency matrix, the provincial capital distance matrix and the spatial geographic reverse matrix. It can be surmised from the table that there is a significant spatial correlation between CO2 emissions and the digital financial inclusion index no matter which spatial weighted matrix is chosen. However, the spatial geographic reverse matrix shows the most significant spatial correlation between CO2 emissions and the digital financial inclusion index. Therefore, we adopted the spatial econometrics model and selected the spatial geographic reverse matrix in the baseline regression. The provincial adjacency matrix and the provincial capital distance matrix were adopted in the robustness test. Furthermore, in order to make sure what model ought to be set, this paper adopted LR tests, and the results show that the probability of the SAR (spatial autoregression model) nested in an SDM (spatial Durbin model) is about 14%, while the probability of the SEM (spatial errors model) nested in an SDM is less than 1%. Thus, we rejected the hypothesis of SEM nested in SDM and there has no obvious evidence of whether SAR is nested in SDM or not. Therefore, the baseline regression model was set as follows:\nCOit = \u03b101DFIit + Xit\u03b30 + \u03b102WCOit + ut + \u03bbi + \u03b5it (8)\nInt. J. Environ. Res.

CO is the indicator of CO2 emissions, DFI is the digital financial inclusion index, Xit is the covariables matrix, ut is the time fixed effect, \u03bbi is the province fixed effect, and \u03b5it is the random error term.

Owing to the controversies of the mediating effect model [34], this paper directly tested the causal relationship between the mechanism variables and the explanatory variables. The model is set as follows:\nMedit = \u03b201DFIit + Xit\u03b70 + \u03b202WMedit + ut + \u03bbi + \u03b5it (10)\nMedit = \u03b211DFIit + Xit\u03b71 + \u03b212WMedit + \u03b213WDFIit + WXit\u03b72 + ut + \u03bbi + \u03b5it (11)\nCOit = \u03c501Medit + Xitv0 + \u03c502WCOit + ut + \u03bbi + \u03b5it (12)\nCOit = \u03c511Medit + Xitv1 + \u03c512WCOit + \u03c513WMedit + WXitv3 + ut + \u03bbi + \u03b5it (13)\nwhere Medit denotes the mediating variable. If \u03c501 is significantly not 0, it means that the mediating variable is significantly correlated with the explained variable, while when \u03b201 is significantly not 0, namely, digital finance has a significant impact on the mediating variable, so it can be taken for granted that when using the SAR model, the mediating mechanism that digital finance affects CO2 emissions through the mediating variable holds. Additionally, if \u03b211 and \u03c511 are significantly not 0, it indicates that the mediating mechanism holds when using the SDM, while if \u03c501 and \u03c513 are significantly not 0, it means that digital finance influences CO2 emissions in the surrounding areas by affecting the mediating variable in surrounding areas."

The K-P LM statistic is 17.212, which corresponds to the p-value of 0.0002, so the instrumental variables are identifiable. The Cragg\u2013Donald Wald F statistic of TS is 20.135, K-P Wald F statistic of it is 18.117, greater than 10% maximal IV size Stock\u2013Yogo weak ID test critical value of 16.38. Thus, TS was not weakly correlated with the digital financial inclusion index. The Cragg\u2013Donald Wald F statistic of DIS is 12.273, greater than 15% maximal IV size Stock\u2013Yogo value of 8.96, and K-P Wald F statistic of it is 6.488, greater than 25% maximal IV size Stock\u2013Yogo value. The Hansen J statistic is 17.862, corresponding to the p-value of 0.0000, thus the instrumental variables were not overidentified, which means they are exogenous. Additionally, considering the possible existence of reverse causality biasing the model estimation, this paper also performed the dynamic spatial panel model test. Panel C of Table 4 shows the results.

Columns (4), (5), and (6) are the results of regressions that lag all explanatory variables by one period and then takes CO2 emissions, which is lagged one period as the explanatory variable. The results of the regressions on Panel C of Table 4 indicate that the digital financial inclusion index reduces carbon emissions at no less than a 5% significance level.\nInt. J. Environ. Res.

Further, considering that the data of CO2 emissions between different regions may not satisfy the parallel trend before and after policy implementation, this paper referred to Qi et al. [38] to test for policy shock by using the spatial DDD model, setting the variable SECT and taking it for 1 when the province was in the top 15 of China in terms of CO2 emissions in 2015, otherwise taking it for 0, and the variable DDD = DID \u00d7 SECT. After that, the spatial DDD model was set as follows:\nCOit = \u03b800 + \u03b801DDDit + \u03b802DIDit + \u03b803TREATit \u00d7 SECTit + \u03b804POSTit \u00d7 SECTit + \u03b805TREATit + \u03b806POSTit + \u03b807SECTit + Xit\u03a60 + \u03b808WCOit + \u03b5it\n(16)\nCOit = \u03b810 + \u03b811DDDit + \u03b812DIDit + \u03b813TREATit \u00d7 SECTit + \u03b814POSTit \u00d7 SECTit + \u03b815TREATit + \u03b816POSTit + \u03b817SECTit + Xit\u03a61 + \u03b818WCOit + \u03b819WDFIit + WXit\u03932 + \u03b5it\n(17)\nGiven the possible multicollinearity problem of fixed effects with POST, SECT, and their interaction term, we used random effect in the spatial DDD model. Table 5 also reports the regression results of the spatial DDD model, showing that the DDD variable is negatively correlated with CO2 emissions at 5% significance level when using the SARDDD model, while the DDD variable is negatively correlated with CO2 emissions at the 1% significance level when adopting the SDM\u2013DDD, so the exogenous shock test passed. Thus, the endogenous test passed, the effect of the digital financial inclusion index on CO2 emissions reduction still held robustly after considering possible omitted variables such as reverse causality, which would cause estimation bias.\nInt.

The regression results of the replaced model tests are shown on Panel A of Table 6, indicating that the digital financial inclusion index suppresses CO2 emissions at the 5% significance level when using the Pooled OLS, differential GMM model and SYS-GMM model, while the digital financial inclusion index suppresses CO2 emissions at 1% when adopting the panel data fixed effect model, SEM and SAC model. Thus, after taking the possible model setting bias which would affect conclusions into account, the digital financial inclusion index still significantly suppresses CO2 emissions. Replaced spatial weighted matrix test: We adopted the provincial adjacency matrix and the provincial capital distance matrix to replace the spatial geographic reverse matrix in the baseline regression. Panel B of Table 6 shows regression results of the replaced spatial weighted matrix robustness test, showing that except for the adoption of SDM with the provincial capital distance matrix, the digital financial inclusion index reduces CO2 emissions at the 5% significance level, the regression results from the rest of the models are negatively correlated at the 1% significance level between two variables. Thus, the replacement of the spatial weight matrix robustness test was performed. Replaced explained variables: Using the raw value of CO2 emissions (unit: 107 t) to replace the logarithmic value in the baseline regression, the regression results shown in Panel C of Table 6 indicate that the digital financial inclusion index is negatively correlated at the 5% significance level with the raw value of CO2 emissions. In the meanwhile, this paper used data from the CEADs China Sub-Provincial CO2 emissions Database to represent the indicator of CO2 emissions, and the regression results that are also shown in Panel C of Table 6 denote that it is negatively correlated with the core explanatory variable at 1%, so the robustness test of the replacing variable passes.

Thus, digital finance reduces CO2 emissions by promoting an increase in the number of green patents granted. Panel C of Table 7 represents the reduction effect of digital finance on CO2 emissions through the promotion of green technological progress. As can be seen from the table, digital finance promotes green technological progress at the 5% significance level, but shows the siphon effect in the peripheries, suppressing the progress of green technology in the surrounding areas. Thus, digital finance reduces CO2 emissions in the local area by promoting green technological progress, but it does reflect the siphon effect, reducing green progress in surrounding areas and thus increasing carbon emissions in surrounding areas.

            "text": "In addition to the above baseline regression, endogenous test, robustness test, mediating mechanism test, and sub-hierarchical indicators test, this paper also carried out the sub-threshold heterogeneity test. Table 9 shows the regression results. Firstly, adopting the core explanatory variable itself as the threshold variable to distinguish the digital financial inclusion index, and the financial regulation (FR), i.e., the ratio of financial regulation expenditure to the regional financial added value, was also used to distinguish the threshold. The threshold value of the digital financial inclusion index was 237.53, while the threshold of financial regulation is 0.07. From columns (1) and (2) of Table 9, it can be seen that the higher the development of digital financial inclusion index, and the higher the ratio of financial regulation expenditure, the greater the reduction effect of digital finance on CO2 emissions in number, and the suppression effect is significant at the 1% level.\nNote: Standard errors are in parentheses. *** and ** represent significance levels of 1% and 5%, respectively.\nSecondly, this paper adopted the regional green development index (GDI) released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China as the threshold, and obtained the threshold value of 0.491, which shows that the effect of digital finance on CO2 emission reduction is significantly negative at 5% when it is less than the threshold value, and negative at 1% when it is greater than the threshold value, indicating that the higher the level of regional green development, the more significant the effect of digital finance on CO2 emission reduction. Thirdly, regional heterogeneity was tested. The North variable was set to 1 when the location of the provincial capital was located north of the Kunlun Mountains\u2013Chin ling Mountains\u2013Huai River line and 0 otherwise. Column (4) of Table 9 reports the results of the test, showing that the effect of digital finance on CO2 reduction is larger numerically and significant at 1% in the south of China, while smaller numerically and not significant in the north. Since it is more developed in the south of China in terms of the economy overall, we can conclude that in economically developed regions, the effect of digital finance on carbon emissions is more significant. Finally, this paper adopted the regional green finance index issued by the IIGF of the Central University of Finance and Economics as the threshold to distinguish the digital financial inclusion index and calculated so as to obtain two threshold values, which are 0.103 and 0.149, respectively. The regression result is reported in column (5) of Table 9, from which it can be seen that the effect of digital finance on CO2 emissions is not significant when the green finance index is lower than 0.103, and the effect of digital finance on CO2 emissions is significantly negative at the 5% significance level when the green finance index is between 0.103 and 0.149, while the effect of digital finance on CO2 emissions is significantly negative at the 1% significance level when the green finance index is higher\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 14276 18 of 21\nthan 0.149, and the reduced effect also increases numerically with higher development of green finance. Therefore, with the development of green finance, the effect of digital finance on carbon emission reduction is greater and more significant. All in all, from the tests above, it can be seen that there is no marginal diminishing effect of digital finance on carbon emissions with the development of itself, economic level, green development, green finance, and increased expenditure in financial regulations. Therefore, promoting the development of digital finance could contribute to carbon emission reduction better. At the same time, digital finance can also help to reduce carbon emissions better in regions with better green development, more developed green finance or more developed economy as well as expending more in financial regulations."

The following conclusions were drawn: 1. Digital finance significantly reduces CO2 emissions, and this result holds after using a 2SLS, dynamic spatial panel data model, spatial DID and spatial DDD exogenous shock tests, replacement model and matrix robustness tests, as well as replacement explained variable robustness tests. 2. Digital finance reduces CO2 emissions by promoting energy industrial structure transformation and spreads to surrounding areas through spillover effects. 3. Digital finance significantly contributes to the increase of green patents granted and thus reduces regional CO2 emissions. 4. Digital finance reduces local CO2 emissions by advancing green technological progress but reduces the green technological progress in surrounding areas and increases CO2 emissions due to the siphon effect. 5. Sub-hierarchical indicators tests show that the usage depth of digital finance, the degree of digitalization, the development of payment, insurance and credit businesses significantly suppress CO2 emissions; however, the effect of the breadth of coverage on CO2 emissions is not significant. 6. With the development of digital finance itself, the level of financial regulation, green development and the green finance index are higher, and the effect of digital finance on CO2 emission reduction is better. Digital finance significantly reduces CO2 emissions in the south of China, but not significantly in the north. Based on the above analysis and conclusions, this paper maintains the following policy suggestions: First, vigorously promote the development of digital finance, advance the environmental protection undertakings and high-quality economic development through technological innovation and low-carbon emission reduction through the development of digital finance. Specifically, we can rely on big data, blockchain, and internet technology to promote financial support for green enterprises and projects and give full play to the ability to reach traditional financial inclusion that cannot be achieved by relying on digital platforms, so that green enterprises that have difficulty enjoying traditional financial services can enjoy the convenience of financial services through digital finance, thus promoting their development and upgrade, while fully encouraging digital platform lending institutions to alleviate the financing difficulties of green industry enterprises, improving the risk prevention of digital platform lending institutions, creating a good market environment, encouraging the innovation of financial services and products, and supporting the development of low-energy-consumption industries through the improvement of financial services. Second, strengthen the organic combination of deepening adjustment of industrial structure and adjustment of energy production and consumption structure, actively promote the transformation of energy consumption structure, realize the transformation from resource dependence to technology dependence, and realize the renewable use of energy and recycling of resources. Promote the ecological development of industries and industrial parks to reduce the intensity of energy and resource consumption. Coordinate and\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 14276 19 of 21\ndevelop the green and low-carbon transformation of energy, and do a good job of green development, low-carbon development and circular development. Third, promote the transaction between carbon emissions of enterprises through digital platforms, provide carbon trading information for enterprises through the network unified trading platform based on big data and the Internet, alleviate the asymmetry of trading information, so as to strengthen the material return to low-carbon emission enterprises and improve the terminal gain of low-carbon action. Fourth, coordinate the improvement of energy efficiency and the development of non-fossil energy sources, such as putting the responsibility of increasing the proportion of non-fossil energy sources into the hands of local governments, and encouraging the transmission of non-fossil energy from regions with abundant non-fossil energy resources to regions with insufficient resources. This will allow for constructing channels for the eastward transmission of electricity from the west and the southward transmission of electricity from the north, taking advantage of the renewable energy resources in the northwest, and achieving a regional balance for sustainable development. This study has conducted a causal inference on the relationship between digital finance and carbon emission reduction by adopting panel data and excluding the endogenous problem, and also explored mediating mechanisms. However, firstly, in Section 2, this paper divided the enterprises into large-scale enterprises of energy-intensive industries and smallscale enterprises with low energy consumption. Digital finance promotes carbon emission reductions by easing financial constraints and supporting the development of SMEs, but for large-scale enterprises with low-energy-consumption, there are relatively few analyses. Secondly, the data in this study are at the provincial level of China, which is a small sample and geographically specific. Thus, future studies can consider using data from prefecturelevel cities or countries around the world. Thirdly, in terms of peak carbon emissions, the indicator of it selected in this paper is the reduction of carbon emissions, which can be characterized by a more comprehensive hand. Finally, the non-linear correlation between digital finance and carbon emission reduction can also be explored.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.W.; Data curation, M.W. and J.G.; Formal analysis, J.G.; Funding acquisition, H.T.; Investigation, M.W.; Methodology, M.W.; Resources, J.G.; Software, M.W.; Supervision, H.T.; Visualization, Y.H.; Writing\u2014original draft, M.W. and J.G.; Writing\u2014review & editing, H.T.
