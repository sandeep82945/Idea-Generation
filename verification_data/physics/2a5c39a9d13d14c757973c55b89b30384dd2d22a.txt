"The effect of functional groups on biogas production will depend on the specific type and number of functional groups present in the biochar, as well as the composition of the microbial community involved in the process. While there is some evidence that certain functional groups in biochar can have negative effects on biogas production, the mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. Further research is needed to better understand the complex interactions among the biochar, microorganisms, and environment in biogas production systems since there is a limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying the negative effects of biochar. The surface properties of biochar can be modified to improve its suitability for use in anaerobic digestion systems. Future research could focus on developing new technologies for modifying biochar properties, such as chemical treatments, thermal treatments, or nanotechnology-based methods."
