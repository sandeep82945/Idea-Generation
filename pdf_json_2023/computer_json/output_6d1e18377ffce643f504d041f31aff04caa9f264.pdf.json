    "abstractText": "In this paper, we investigate joint optimization of secure AirComp and reliable multicasting assisted by a multipleinput multiple-output untrusted two-way relay, where artificial noise is employed at the access point (AP) to interfere the relay for ensuring secure AirComp. We aim to minimize the computation distortion at the AP by jointly designing the transmit variables of all the nodes and the aggregation variables at the AP and relay, under the secure AirComp constraint, the reliable multicasting constraint, and the transmit power constraints of all the nodes. We consider two scenarios that perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) are available. For the former, the formulated optimization problem is highly nonconvex, and we propose an effective block coordinate descent (BCD)penalty successive convex approximation (penaltySCA) method to solve the nonconvex problem. For the latter, we model the imperfect CSI by using worst-case criterion and the formulated robust optimization problem is much more challenging than its counterpart with perfect CSI. To solve the robust problem effectively, we first transform it to a deterministic optimization problem by employing some powerful mathematical lemmas, and then apply the proposed BCD-penaltySCA method to solve the reformulated deterministic problem. The proposed methods are shown by simulations to significantly reduce the computation distortion compared with other benchmarks under considering secure AirComp and reliable multicasting.",

INTRODUCTION\nOVER-the-air computation (AirComp) is a promisingtechnique to aggregate the sensing data from the distribusted sensors in the internet of things (IoT) network by exploiting the supposition of wireless signals over the multiple access channel, bringing the advantage of very high spectral efficiency and extremely low communication delay [1]\u2013[3].\nCopyright (c) 20xx IEEE.

Yang is with the College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha 410082, China (e-mail: liangy@hnu.edu.cn).\nAlthough some works consider computational rate as the objective function [4], [5], the objective function of most prior works is the computation error, namely, mean squared error (MSE) of the aggregation result of the sensors\u2019 data [6]\u2013[11]. Many early works focus on the point-to-point (i.e. single-hop) AirComp networks where the sensors directly communicate with the access point (AP), and optimize the power control in single-antenna AirComp networks [6]\u2013[8] or the beamforming in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) AirComp networks [9]\u2013[11]. Beside wireless communication, the AirComp is also used in other fields. In federated learning, the authors in [12] transmit each distributed device\u2019s gradient through AirComp, while the authors in [13] propose a coded AirComp scheme for fast model aggregation. In [14], the AirComp is introduced to enable efficient computation of the control signal for control systems.\nHowever, the AP in the AirComp network may suffer from severe fading when sensors are far from it. In order to address the issue caused by severe fading, relays have been widely applied in the traditional wireless communication networks [15]\u2013[25]. In order to obtain better quality of service, singleantenna relay [15], [16] and multi-antenna relay [17], [18] are investigated in wireless communication networks. Some existing research works also consider the cooperation with relay [19], [20] or selection of multiple relays [21], [22] schemes in wireless communication networks. Furthermore, due to the high maneuverability and flexible deployment, the works in [23]\u2013[25] consider utilizing the unmanned aerial vehicle as a relay.\nMotivated by the great success of relaying in wireless communications, relays have been introduced in the evolving AirComp networks [26]\u2013[34]. However, to the best of our knowledge, an untrusted two-way relay assisted AirComp is not in the literature and its security issue is worth studying. In this paper, we investigate joint optimization of secure AirComp and reliable multicasting in a MIMO untrusted twoway relay assisted communication and computation network, where the AP and the relay have multiple antennas and the sensors have a single antenna.

            "text": "The novelty of our work comes from the following three main aspects. First, compared with the existing relay assisted AirComp [26]\u2013[34], the proposed untrusted relay assisted AirComp wants to prevent the relay from wiretapping the aggregation of the sensors\u2019 data and thus has an additional security constraint based on the computation distortion, which is highly nonconvex and make the optimization problem much more challenging to deal with. Second, conventional untrusted relay assisted communication needs to decode each data of the sources (sensors), aiming to maximize the secrecy rate or improve the communication reliability [36]\u2013[41], while our proposed untrusted relay assisted AirComp focuses on the secure aggregation of the sensors\u2019 data instead of decoding individual data and its performance metric is the computation distortion in the received value of the desired function, which is a totally different objective from convectional untrusted relay assisted communication. Third, the existing relay assisted AirComp [26]\u2013[34] only consider the case of perfect CSI which is only applicable to a specific scenario, while our work considers both cases of perfect and imperfect CSI and has a greater flexibility to adapt to different application scenarios.\nThe main contributions of our work are summarized as follows.\n\u2022 We propose a MIMO untrusted two-way relay assisted secure AirComp and reliable multicasting network, where we employ the multicasting signal and the AN to interfere the relay to ensure secure AirComp. We formulate the MSE minimization problem with the nonconvex secure AirComp constraint and reliable multicasting constraints, considering both perfect and imperfect CSI. \u2022 With perfect CSI available, we propose an effective block coordinate descent (BCD)-penalty successive convex approximation (penaltySCA) method to solve the nonconvex MSE minimization problem, where the aggregation variables are found in closed form and the transmit variables are optimized by the SCA or penaltySCA method in which a second-order cone programming (SOCP) or a semidefinite programming (SDP) is solved. \u2022 When the CSI is imperfect, we employ the worst-case criterion to model the CSI, and the corresponding robust MSE minimization problem is much more challenging than its counterpart with perfect CSI. To make the robust problem tractable, we transform it to a deterministic optimization problem by employing some powerful mathematical lemmas. Since he reformulated deterministic problem is still nonvenvex, we apply the proposed BCDpenaltySCA method to deal with it.\n\u2022 We provide numerical results to show that compared with other benchmarks, the proposed methods have a significant improvement in terms of the computation distortion under the constraints of secure AirComp and reliable multicasting."

            "text": "Since the relay can substantially overcome the disadvantage of short coverage of single-hop AirComp networks, relayassisted (i.e. two-hop) AirComp networks have been studied recently [26]\u2013[33]. The authors in [26] study a hierarchical Aircomp network assisted by multiple single-antenna relays, and propose a centralized algorithm and a decentralized algorithm with global and partial CSI, respectively. In [27], a part of sensors transmit their sensing signals to the AP with the assistance of a single-antenna cooperative relay, while other sensors directly send their sensing signals to the AP, and the impact caused by the relay position has been studied. A cooperative multi-antenna amplify-and-forward (AF) relay aided AirComp network has been considered in [30], while the corresponding case of cooperating with multiple multi-antenna AF relays has been investigated in [31]. The works [32], [33] mainly focused on the performance analysis of relayassisted AirComp networks. The authors in [32] analyzed the MSE outage probability and diversity order in the context of AirComp and developed a relay selection scheme to achieve the full diversity order, and the work [33] studied wireless edge federated learning system based on relay-assisted AirComp and characterized the decoding failure probability at the AP. Different from the above two-hop AirComp networks, the work [34] proposed a multi-hop digital AirComp network where the authors derived the computation rate and proposed a time allocation and power control scheme to improve the network performance.\nIn the aforementioned scenarios, the relay is considered to be trusted, in the sense that, the relay will not infer the aggregation result of the sensing data from the sensors. However, when the relay is interested in the aggregation result and tends to decipher the result for the unallowed operations,\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

A MIMO untrusted two-way relay assisted AirComp and multicasting networks.\ndespite operating with the desired relaying protocols, the relay becomes untrusted [35]. To maximize the secrecy rate, the security issue of an untrusted relay assisted communication has been widely investigated in the literature [36]\u2013[41]. In [36], the secrecy outage probability and ergodic secrecy rate in a cooperative network in presence of multiple untrusted singleantenna relays and multiple passive eavesdroppers has been investigated. A non-orthogonal multiple access scheme has been considered in [37], where the single-antenna relay that assists the communications between the source and the far user is assumed to be untrusted. In [38], both scenarios of singleantenna and multiple-antenna relay are investigated, and the analytical expression for a lower bound on the ergodic secrecy sum rate has been derived. In [39], both cooperative and noncooperative secure beamforming schemes with a untrusted MIMO AF relay have been investigated, and the result in [39] has been extended to MIMO two-way untrusted relay systems [40]. Later, the MIMO two-way untrusted relay in [40] has been considered to perform full-duplex operation in [41].\nWith regard to the security design for AirComp, in [42], a friendly jammer is used to against passive eavesdropping, where the jammer\u2019s signal is reconstructed and fully canceled by the legitimate receiver but deteriorates the eavesdropper\u2019s signal-noise-ratio (SNR), and thus inhibits the illegitimate receivers ability to estimate the value of the objective function. Different from the secrecy rate of the physical layer security defined in traditional wireless communications, a \u03b4semantically secure based on the total variation norm on signed measures and a V-MSE-secure are defined in [42], which means that the estimation MSE at the eavesdropper is at least V under a uniformly distributed objective, regardless of which estimator the eavesdropper uses. In [43], a multiantenna full-duplex AP utilizes the AN to degrade the eavesdropper\u2019s links while receiving sensors\u2019 pre-processed sensing signals."

            "text": "Consider a MIMO untrusted two-way relay assisted AirComp and multicasting networks as shown in Fig. 1, where K sensors want to send their sensing data (e.g. temperature, humidity) to the AP for aggregation and meanwhile the AP transmits a common signal to all the sensors for some multicasting applications (e.g. updating the status of sensors),\nboth with the help of an untrusted two-way relay. We assume that the sensors are equipped with a single antenna, and the relay and AP has Nr and Np antennas, respectively [30].\nThe transmission of data are finished in two consecutive time slots. In the first time slot, all the sensors send their data to the relay simultaneously, in which the transmitted data by the kth sensor is denoted as\nxk = bksk (1)\nwhere sk is the sensing data with zero mean and unit variable, and bk is the corresponding transmit coefficient.\nMeanwhile, the AP transmits a common signal sc to the relay, and in order to protect the aggregation of sensors\u2019 data from being wiretapped by the untrusted relay, the AP also transmits an AN signal z to interfere the relay. Thus, the transmitted signal by the AP is expressed as\nxc = wsc +Vz, (2)\nwhere w and V is the beamforming vector/matrix for sc and z, respectively, and sc \u2208 CN (0, 1), z \u2208 CN (0, I).\nFrom (1) and (2), the received signal at the relay in the first time slot is given by\nya = K\u2211\nk=1\nhkbksk +Hp(wsc +Vz) + nr, (3)\nwhere hk and Hp denotes the channel from the kth sensor and AP to the relay, respectively, and nr \u2208 CN (0, \u03c32rI) is the additive noise at the relay.\nIn the second time slot, the signal received at the relay is multiplied by a beamforming matrix F and then forwarded to the sensors and AP. From (3), the signal received at the AP is given by\nyp = GpF\n( K\u2211\nk=1\nhkbksk +Hp(wsc +Vz) + nr ) + np,\n(4)\nwhere gk and Gp denotes the channel from the relay to the kth sensor and AP, respectively, and nk \u2208 CN (0, \u03c32k) and np \u2208 CN (0, \u03c32pI) is the additive noise at the kth sensor and AP, respectively.\nTo achieve secure AirComp, the minimum computation distortion measured by MSE at the untrusted relay should be larger than some given threshold, such that the relay cannot compute the aggregation of the sensors\u2019 data accurately enough. Considering the relay is interested to compute the arithmetic sum of the sensors\u2019 data, i.e., s\u0304 = \u2211K k=1 sk, and applies the aggregation beamforming vector a to estimate the value of s\u0304 as\ns\u0302 = a\u2020ya. (5)\nBased on (3) and (5), the computation distortion at the relay is given by [26]\u2013[28]\nMSEr = E(|s\u0304\u2212 s\u0302|2)\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

We assume that the CSI about Hp and Gp are accurate, which is reasonable when the AP and relay are fixed and the channels are estimated through pilot signals with high transmit power [26]\u2013[28]. Then, the AP can completely remove the self-interference signal wsc + Vz in (4), and the remaining signal at the AP is given by\ny\u0303p = K\u2211 k=1 GpFhkbksk +GpFnr + np. (7)\nFrom (7), the MSE for the AP to estimate the arithmetic sum of the sensors\u2019 data is expressed as\nMSEp = K\u2211 k=1 \u2223\u2223d\u2020GpFhkbk \u2212 1\u2223\u22232 + \u03c32r \u2225\u2225d\u2020GpF\u2225\u22252 + \u03c32p \u2225d\u22252 . (8)\nFrom (6) and (8), we can see that the signal transmitted by the AP will only affect the computation distortion at the relay not that at the AP, which possibly provides an effective method for computation security against the relay while not interfering the data aggregation at the AP.\nAt the kth sensor, the received signal given by\nyk = g \u2020 kF ( K\u2211 i=1 hibisi +Hp(wsc +Vz) + nr ) + nk. (9)\nNote that yk contains the signal sk sent by the kth sensor in the first time slot, and sk is known at the kth sensor. Thus, the kth sensor can eliminate the self-interference caused by sk before decoding the common signal sc. Let rk denotes the achievable information rate of the kth sensor, and we use the achievable information rate of each sensor to measure the quality of the multicasting. Obviously, the effect of selfinterference elimination depends on the corresponding CSI, i.e. hk and gk, and the cases of perfect and imperfect CSI will be discussed in the rest of this paper.\nBased on the above, we formulate the optimization problem as\nmin F,V,w,d,{bk} MSEp (10a)\ns.t. min a\nMSEr \u2265 \u03ber, (10b)\nrk \u2265 Rk, k = 1, ...K, (10c) |bk|2 \u2264 Pk, k = 1, ...K, (10d) \u2225w\u22252 + \u2225V\u22252 \u2264 Pap, (10e)\nK\u2211 k=1 \u2225Fhkbk\u22252 + \u2225FHpw\u22252 + \u2225FHpV\u22252 + \u03c32r \u2225F\u2225 2 \u2264 Pr.\n(10f)\nIn problem (10), we aim to minimize the computation distortion at the AP (i.e. (10a)), based on the conditions that the minimum computation distortion at the untrusted relay should be larger than a given threshold \u03ber (i.e. (10b)) to protect the computation security, the achievable information rate of kth sensor is greater than a target transmission rate Rk (i.e. (10c)) to ensure the reliable multicasting, and the transmit power constraints at the sensors, AP and relay (i.e. (10d)-(10f)) with the corresponding power budget {Pk}, Pap and Pr.\nRemark 1 (Encryption Technique): Besides the PLS, another security technology, called the encryption technique, is also widely used [44]\u2013[47]. The homomorphic encryption, which has the property that the result of decryption after adding ciphertext is equivalent to the addition of plaintext, could be applied in this AirComp network. Combing with the PLS technology, the ciphertext received by the relay may be scrambled. Due to the avalanche effect [44], it is more difficult for the untrusted relay to recover the plaintext from the received ciphertext, and the protection of the aggregation result has been strengthened. As for some classic homomorphic encryption methods, such as the elliptic curve cryptography [45] and Paillier [46], we need to change the computing function of AirComp into a polynomial to adapt to their operation on the ciphertext. In addition, since the encryption methods, especially some non-lightweight methods, may bring a large computational burden to the sensors [47], and whether the encryption method can be applied to the network depends on the sensors\u2019 computing resources and power budget."

To solve the problem (27) effectively, in this subsection, we will propose an efficient penaltySCA method that converts the nonconvex problem into a differential convex (DC) form and then linearizes the nonconvex terms.\nBecause the nonconvex constraint (27b) contains the inverse operation of the matrix, it is very difficult to solve it directly. In order to facilitate the expression and handling, we introduce some slack variables {X,Y,T, t} and combine (18) and (19), and then the constraint (27b) can be represented as\nX = [b1h1, ..., bKhK ], (28a) T = [X HpV Hpw], (28b) t = Hb, (28c)\nY = TT\u2020, (28d) t\u2020 ( \u03c32rI+Y )\u22121 t \u2264 \u03be\u0302r, (28e)\nwhere\nH = [Fh1, ...,FhK ], (29) b = [b1, ..., bK ] T . (30)\nNote that the equality constraints (28a)-(28c) are linear and thus are convex, and the left hand side of the inequality constraint (28e) is a matrix fractional function [48], which means that (28e) is also convex and can be represented as a linear matrix inequality (LMI):[\n\u03be\u0302r t \u2020\nt \u03c32rI+Y\n] \u227d 0. (31)\nHowever, the equality constraint (28d) is quadratic over T and thus is a nonconvex constraint. To tackle this equality constraint, we need the following result.\nLemma 1: The equality constraint Y = TT\u2020 is equivalent to [\nY T T\u2020 I\n] \u227d 0, (32)\ntr(Y \u2212TT\u2020) \u2264 0, (33)\nwhere the first constraint is an LMI and the second is a difference of convex constraint.\nProof: please see Appendix A. Substituting (27b) by (28), the optimization problem (27)\ncan be expressed as\nmin V,w,{bk} K\u2211 k=1 \u2223\u2223\u2223d\u0302\u2020Fhk\u2223\u2223\u22232 |bk|2 \u2212 2 K\u2211 k=1 \u211c{d\u0302\u2020Fhkbk} (34a) s.t. tr(Y \u2212TT\u2020) \u2264 0, (34b)\n\u2212 \u2223\u2223\u2223g\u2020kFHpw\u2223\u2223\u22232 + \u03c3\u03022k \u2264 0, k = 1, ...K, (34c)\n(27d), (28a) \u2212 (28c), (31), (32). (34d)\nNow, we can employ the penalty method [48] to solve problem (34), where a penalty term is incorporated into the objective function in order to handle the nonconvex constraint,\nmin V,w,{bk},X,Y,T,t K\u2211 k=1 \u2223\u2223\u2223d\u0302\u2020Fhk\u2223\u2223\u22232 |bk|2 \u2212 2\nK\u2211 k=1 \u211c{d\u0302\u2020Fhkbk}+ \u03c2tr(Y \u2212TT\u2020) (35a)\ns.t.\u2212 \u2223\u2223\u2223g\u2020kFHpw\u2223\u2223\u22232 + \u03c3\u03022k \u2264 0, k = 1, ...K, (35b)\n(27d), (28a) \u2212 (28c), (31), (32). (35c)\nwhere \u03c2 > 0 is a sufficiently large penalty factor.\nHeretofore, we have transformed the nonconvex constraint (27b) into a series of convex constraints and a DC penalty term. Nevertheless, the optimization problem (35) is nonconvex due to the last penalty term in (35a) and the nonconvex constraint (35b) (i.e. constraint (27c)). Since both (35a) and (35b) are in the DC form, we employ the SCA method to solve it. By the convexity, we first have\ntr(TT\u2020) \u2265 2\u211c{tr(T(n)\u2020T)} \u2212 tr(T(n)T(n)\u2020) , f (n) (T) , (36)\u2223\u2223\u2223g\u2020kFHpw\u2223\u2223\u22232 \u2265 2\u211c{w(n)\u2020H\u2020pF\u2020gkg\u2020kFHpw}\n\u2212 \u2223\u2223\u2223g\u2020kFHpw(n)\u2223\u2223\u22232 , g(n)k (w) , (37)\nwhere ( V(n),w(n), {b(n)k },T(n) ) is the optimal solution at the nth iteration.\nNote that f (n) (T) and g(n)k (w) in (36) and (37) are two linear functions. Applying them to (35), at the (n + 1)th iteration, we solve the following convex problem:\nmin V,w,{bk},X,Y,T,t K\u2211 k=1 \u2223\u2223\u2223d\u0302\u2020Fhk\u2223\u2223\u22232 |bk|2 \u2212 2\nK\u2211 k=1 \u211c{d\u0302\u2020Fhkbk}+ \u03c2(tr(Y)\u2212 f (n) (T)) (38a)\ns.t. \u03c1k K\u2211 i=1,i \u0338=k \u2223\u2223\u2223g\u2020kFhi\u2223\u2223\u22232 |bi|2 + \u03c1k \u2225\u2225\u2225g\u2020kFHpV\u2225\u2225\u22252 \u2212 g(n)k (w) + \u03c3\u0302 2 k \u2264 0, k = 1, ...K, (38b)\n(27d), (28a) \u2212 (28c), (31), (32).

The solution of updating {d,a} is given in closed form. The subproblems of updating {F} and {V,w, bk} are solved by applying the SCA and the proposed penaltySCA, respectively. The details of the proposed BCDpenaltySCA algorithm are summarized in Algorithm 1.\nAlgorithm 1 The Proposed BCD-penaltySCA Algorithm to Solve Problem (13)\n1: Initializing: n = 0, {F(0),V(0),w(0), b(0)k }; 2: Repeat: 3: Compute d(n+1) and a(n+1) according to (16) and (17); 4: Solve the SOCP (26) to obtain F(n+1); 5: Solve the SDP (40) to obtain {V(n+1),w(n+1), b(n+1)k }; 6: n := n+ 1; 7: Until: Convergence.\nRemark 2 (Convergence Analysis of Algorithm 1): By (16), (17), (26) and (40), we update the blocks {d,a}, {F} and {V,w, bk} iteratively. Because (16) and (17) have the closed form and problems (26) and (40) are convex, updating {d,a}, {F} and {V,w, bk} iteratively will only decease or maintain\nthe objective value of problem (13). By updating {d,a}, {F} and {V,w, bk} iteratively, we obtain a monotonically decreasing sequence of the objective values of problem (13) which is lower bounded by zero since MSE is positive. Therefore, the proposed Algorithm 1 converges.\nRemark 3 (Complexity of Algorithm 1): The main computational burden of Algorithm 1 is from solving the SOCP (26) and SDP (40), whose complexity is about O(K0.5N6m log(1/\u03b5)) and O(K0.5N7m log(1/\u03b5)) where Nm = max(Nr, Np) [50]. Thus, the complexity of Algorithm 1 is about O(L1K0.5N7m log(1/\u03b5)) where L1 is the iterative number for the convergence of Algorithm 1.\nRemark 4 (The Limitation of the Proposed Algorithm): In general, the proposed BCD-penaltySCA algorithm can only obtain the local optimal solution to the problem (13). Although the outer polyblock approximation algorithm in [51] is employed to obtain a global optimal solution for a DC program, it cannot be applied to obtain a globally optimal solution to the DC program (35) due to the nonconvex quadratic and LMI constraints in the problem (35). Since problem (35) is a subproblem of the original problem (13), how to obtain a global optimal solution to the problem (13) is still unknown. In addition, the penalty factor \u03c2 needs to be selected appropriately according to a specific problem to obtain a faster convergence speed."

(58)\n3) Transformation of the Constraint (46c): Since there are fractions in constraint (46c) and both the numerator and denominator contain channel uncertainty, we cannot rewrite the constraints as the form that the norm of a vector is less than or equal to some value and apply the Lemma 2 to convert them into LMIs. By introducing the slack variables {\u03c9k}, we rewrite (46c) as\nK\u2211 i=1,i\u0338=k \u2223\u2223\u2223g\u2020kFhibi\u2223\u2223\u22232 + \u2225\u2225\u2225g\u2020kFHpV\u2225\u2225\u22252 + \u03c32r \u2225\u2225\u2225g\u2020kF\u2225\u2225\u22252 + \u03c3\u03032k \u2264 \u03c9k, (59a)\u2223\u2223\u2223g\u2020kFHpw\u2223\u2223\u22232 \u2265 \u03c1k\u03c9k, (59b)\nfor all hk \u2208 Hk, gk \u2208 Gk, K = 1, ...,K.\nFor the constraint (59a), neglecting higher order error terms, we can rewrite it as\n\u2225\u03c8k\u22252 \u2264 \u03c9k, (60)\nwhere\n\u03c8k , \u03c8\u0304k + K\u2211 i=1 \u03a8k,i\u2206h,i +\u03a8g\u2206g,k, (61)\n\u03c8\u0304k = \ng\u0304\u2020kFh\u03041b1 ...\ng\u0304\u2020kFh\u0304k\u22121bk\u22121 0 g\u0304\u2020kFh\u0304k+1bk+1 ...\ng\u0304\u2020kFh\u0304KbK V\u2020H\u2020pF\n\u2020g\u0304k \u03c3rF \u2020g\u0304k\n , (62)\nand\n\u03a8k,i =  0g\u0304\u2020kFbi 0  , \u03a8g =  b\u22171h\u0304 \u2020 1F \u2020 ... b\u2217K h\u0304 \u2020 KF \u2020\nV\u2020H\u2020pF \u2020\n\u03c3rF \u2020\n .

(66)\nFor the constraint (59b), its form is similar to the constraint (56), and we apply the Lemma 3 again. For ease of exposition, we insert gk = g\u0304k +\u2206g,k into (59b) and recast it as{\n\u2200 \u2206g,k : \u2206\u2020g,k\u2206g,k \u2212 \u03f52g,k \u2264 0, \u2212\u2206\u2020g,k\u0393\u2206g,k \u2212 2\u211c { g\u0304\u2020k\u0393\u2206g,k } \u2212 g\u0304\u2020k\u0393g\u0304k + \u03c1k\u03c9k \u2264 0,\n(67) where\n\u0393 = FHpww \u2020H\u2020pF \u2020. (68)\nApplying Lemma 3 to (67), we covert the constraint (59b) to an LMI:[\n\u03b6kI+ \u0393 \u0393 \u2020g\u0304k\ng\u0304\u2020k\u0393 \u2212\u03f52g,k\u03b6k \u2212 \u03c1k\u03c9k + g\u0304 \u2020 k\u0393g\u0304k\n] \u227d 0. (69)\n4) Transformation of the Constraint (46f): Similar to the constraint (47b), we can use Lemma 2 again and rewrite the robust transmit power constraint (46f) as an LMI: [ Pr \u2212\u2211Kk=1 \u00b5r,k \u03c8\u0304\u2020r\u03c8\u0304r I ] \u2126\u2020r\n\u2126r diag({\u00b5r,kI}Kk=1)  \u227d 0, (70)\nwhere\n\u03c8\u0304r = \nFh\u03041b1 ...\nFh\u0304KbK FHpw\nvec(FHpV) \u03c3rvec(F)\n , (71)\nand\n\u03a8r,k = [ 0 FT bk 0 ]T , Ur,k = [ 0 \u03a8\u2020r,k ] , (72)\n\u2126r = [\u2212\u03f5h,1UTr,1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\u2212\u03f5h,KUTr,K ]T .

Thus, the proposed Algorithm 2 also converges.\nRemark 6 (Complexity of Algorithm 2): The computational complexity of Algorithm 2 is mainly from solving the SDPs, whose complexity is about O(K4N7m log(1/\u03b5)) [50]. Thus, the computational complexity of Algorithm 2 is about O ( L2K 4N7m log(1/\u03b5) ) , where L2 is the iterative number for the convergence of Algorithm 2. Remark 7 (The Choice Between Robust and Approximate CSI): Another way to handle the channel uncertainty is to use the approximated CSI. As in [57]\u2013[59], the AP can act as a central processor to perform the optimization process. Thus, the AP has the ability to estimate the error caused by using the approximate CSI and decides whether to use Algorithm 1 to obtain a approximate solution with a lower computational complexity or Algorithm 2 to obtain a robust solution."

            "heading": "A. Performances of Proposed Scheme for Perfect CSI",
            "text": "With perfect CSI available, we compare our proposed scheme with three benchmarks, including the zero-forcing reception and zero-forcing transmission scheme proposed in [60] (denoted as \u201cZFR-ZFT\u201d) and the maximal-ratio reception and maximal-ratio transmission scheme proposed in [61] (denoted as \u201cMRR-MRT\u201d) and our proposed scheme with randomly generated AN (denoted as \u201cRandAN\u201d). If not specified, we set the transmit power budget of the sensors, relay and AP is Ps/\u03c3\n2 = 10 dB, Pr/\u03c32 = 30 dB and Pap/\u03c32 = 40 dB, the minimum MSE constraint at the relay is \u03ber = 3, and the SINR threshold at the sensors is \u03c1 = 2 dB.\nIn Fig. 2, we present the average computation MSE at the AP under different minimum MSE constraint at the relay. From Fig. 2, we see that the proposed scheme has a significantly reduction of the computation MSE at the AP over the \u201cRandAN\u201d scheme for different minimum MSE constraint at the relay, which indicates that the AN plays an important role to satisfy the secure AirComp constraint at the relay. Furthermore, the \u201cRandAN\u201d scheme outperforms the \u2018ZFR-ZFT\u201d and \u201cMRR-MRT\u201d schemes, which means that using specified relay beamforming schemes cannot reduce the computation MSE at the AP effectively. In Fig. 2, we also see that when the minimum MSE constraint at the relay is not too large, the average computation MSE at the AP by all the schemes grows not too fast, however, when the minimum MSE constraint at the relay is larger, the average computation MSE at the AP has a relatively rapid increase, which is maybe because that when the minimum MSE constraint at the relay is too large, most of the power is allocated to satisfy the secure AirComp constraint and thus significantly increases the average computation MSE at the AP.\nIn Fig. 3, we present the average computation MSE at the AP under different SINR threshold at the sensors. From Fig. 3, we can see that the proposed scheme is better than all the other benchmarks for different reliable multicasting requirements.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n12\nWe can also see from Fig. 3 that as the SINR threshold at the sensors increases, the average computation MSE at the AP by all the schemes grows, which is because that as the SINR threshold at the sensors increases, more power has to be allocated to satisfy the reliable multicasting requirement and then less power is allocated to reduce the computation MSE at the AP.\nIn Fig. 4, we present the average computation MSE at the AP under different transmit power budget of the sensors. From Fig. 4, it is seen that for different transmit power budget of the sensors, the proposed scheme outperforms all the other benchmarks in terms of the average computation MSE at the AP. We can also see from Fig. 4 that as the transmit power budget of the sensors increases, the average computation MSE at the AP by all the schemes decreases, which is because as the transmit power of the sensors increases, the AP is easier to align the signals of all the sensors to compress the calculation error.\nIn Fig. 5, we investigate the average computation MSE at the AP under different network configuration. If we only increase the antenna number of AP and relay, Np and Nr, the\nnetwork obtains more antenna resources and has greater space freedom to optimize the beamforming design at the AP and relay, thus achieving better network performance [62]. But, if we only increase the number of sensors, K, the network needs to support more sensors to achieve reliable multicast, and at this time, fewer transmit antennas at the AP and relay are difficult to support more sensors [63]. Therefore, as the number of sensors increases, the antenna number of AP and relay should also increase accordingly, and in Fig. 5, we set Np = Nr = 1.1K. From Fig. 5, we can see that as the network size increases, the average computation MSE at the AP by our proposed algorithm slowly increases. Thus, in order to meet the accuracy requirements of AirComp in practical applications, it is necessary to choose an appropriate network configuration.\nIn Table I, we show the time to compute the solution by our proposed Algorithm 1 under different network configuration. The simulations were performed in MATLAB on a Windows desktop with 4 Intel i3 cores and 16 GB of RAM. From Table I, we can see that as the network size increases, the computing time of our proposed Algorithm 1 increases, which is because Algorithm 1 needs to solve a larger scale SOCP or SDP. In order to accelerate the computing of the optimization solutions, a feasible approach is to design a parallel algorithm for Algorithm 1, such as using the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) [64] to solve the SOCP and using parallel primal-dual interior-point method [65] to solve the SDP. This is reserved for an interesting future work.\nTABLE I COMPUTING TIME OF ALGORITHM 1 UNDER DIFFERENT NETWORK CONFIGURATION\n(K,Np, Nr) Computing Time(s) (10, 11, 11) 2.1 (20, 22, 22) 22.3 (30, 33, 33) 270.4 (40, 44, 44) 1317.5 (50, 55, 55) 4520.1\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

            "text": "With imperfect CSI available, we compare our proposed robust scheme (dented as \u201cProposed Robust\u201d) with the proposed robust scheme with randomly generated AN (denoted as \u201cRobust RandAN\u201d), and the proposed scheme with perfect CSI is given which serves as a performance upper (or MSE lower) bound (dented as \u201cPerfect CSI\u201d). If not specified, the simulation parameter setting is the same as that in the case of perfect CSI, and a normalized channel error radius is used and set as 0.02.\nIn Fig. 6, we show the average worst-case computation MSE at the AP under different minimum MSE constraint at the relay. From Fig. 6, we can see that the proposed robust scheme is close to the scheme with perfect CSI, which indicates that the proposed robust scheme can effectively reduce the performance loss raised by the channel errors. We can also see from Fig. 6 that the proposed robust scheme is better than the \u201cRobust RandAN\u201d scheme, which again shows the importance of the AN to satisfy the secure AirComp constraint even with the channel errors.\nIn Fig. 7, we show the average worst-case computation MSE at the AP under different normalized channel error radius. From Fig. 7, it is seen that the average worst-case computation MSE at the AP by the proposed robust scheme and the \u201cRobust RandAN\u201d scheme increases with the channel error radius increasing. We can also see from Fig. 7 that the performance gab between the proposed robust scheme, the \u201cRobust RandAN\u201d scheme and the \u201cPerfect CSI\u201d scheme tends to be greater when the channel error radius goes to be larger. This is because as the channel error radius increases, the robust secure AirComp constraint and reliable multicasting requirement become more strict and thus increase the worstcase computation MSE.\nIn Fig. 8, we investigate the average worst-case computation MSE at the AP under different network configuration, where we set Np = Nr = 1.1K. From Fig. 8, we can see that as the network size increases, the average worst-case computation MSE at the AP by our proposed robust scheme increases slowly. But the average worst-case computation MSE by the\n\u201cRobust RandAN\u201d scheme grows more quickly, which is due to the fact that randomly generated AN becomes harder to satisfy the secure AirComp constraint at the relay and easier to raise the computation MSE at the AP. From Fig. 8, we can also see that the proposed robust scheme is close to the scheme with perfect CSI, which indicates again that the proposed robust scheme can effectively reduce the performance loss due to the channel errors.\nIn Table II, we show the time to compute the solution by our proposed robust Algorithm 2 under different network configuration. The simulations were performed on the same desktop as Algorithm 1. From Table II, we can see that as the network size increases, the proposed robust Algorithm 2 needs to solve larger scale SDPs, and thus the computing time increases. Similar to Algorithm 1, in order to accelerate the computing of the solutions by robust Algorithm 2, a feasible approach is to design a parallel algorithm for Algorithm 2, e.g., using parallel primal-dual interior-point methods [65] to solve the SDPs.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

            "text": "In this paper, we have studied the joint optimization of secure AirComp and reliable multicasting in a MIMO untrusted two-way relay assisted computation and communication networks, where artificial noise is employed at the AP to interfere the relay for ensuring secure AirComp. We have formulated the optimization problems for two cases of prefect and imperfect CSI. We propose an effective BCD-penaltySCA algorithm for the case of perfect CSI, while for the case of imperfect CSI, we first transform the robust optimization problem to a deterministic problem and then employ the proposed BCD-penaltySCA algorithm to solve the reformulated deterministic problem. Numerical results have demonstrated that the proposed schemes outperform other benchmarks in terms of the computation distortion under the constraints of secure AirComp and reliable multicasting."
