1. **Investigate the existence and computation of EF1 and PO allocations for chores with more general valuation functions.** The paper considers chores with additive valuations, but many practical applications involve chores with more general valuation functions, such as lexicographic or bi-valued valuations. It would be interesting to explore the existence and computation of EF1 and PO allocations for these more general valuation functions.


2. **Develop approximation algorithms for DEF-k allocations.** The paper shows that finding the minimal k for which a DEF-k allocation exists is NP-hard, even for highly restricted classes of valuations. This suggests that it may be difficult to find exact DEF-k allocations in practice. It would be useful to develop approximation algorithms that can find DEF-k allocations with a small value of k in polynomial time.


3. **Study the relationship between DEF-k and other fairness notions.** The paper introduces the DEF-k fairness notion, which is a relaxation of EF1 that allows for the introduction of dubious chores. It would be interesting to study the relationship between DEF-k and other fairness notions, such as envy-freeness up to one good (EF1) and envy-freeness up to any good (EF0). This could help to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of different fairness notions.


4. **Explore applications of DEF-k to other domains.** The paper focuses on the application of DEF-k to the fair allocation of chores. However, the DEF-k fairness notion could also be applied to other domains, such as the fair allocation of goods, resources, or tasks. It would be interesting to explore these applications and to investigate how DEF-k can be used to achieve fairness in these different domains.


5. **Conduct experimental studies to evaluate the performance of DEF-k algorithms.** The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the DEF-k fairness notion, but it does not provide any experimental results. It would be useful to conduct experimental studies to evaluate the performance of different DEF-k algorithms in practice. This could help to identify the most effective algorithms for finding DEF-k allocations and to better understand the trade-offs between fairness and efficiency.
