            "text": "Due to the conflicts between the neurovascular bundle and osteo-tendineous and muscular structures, compression of the subclavian vein can result in outflow impairment during 90\u25e6 upper limb abduction. Most subjects with positional neurovascular compression during abduction remain asymptomatic. When symptomatic, this positional neurovascular compression is called thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) (1\u20135). Most symptomatic TOS are considered to result from neural compression. Thrombotic complication of the positional compression of the subclavian vein (Paget Schroetter syndrome) is reported to be the second most frequent form of TOS (6\u20138). Beyond these thrombotic complications, many patients experience transient positional venous outflow impairment by subclavian vein compression that can occasionally be symptomatic (McCleery syndrome) (9), but that mainly remain asymptomatic. We recently proposed the use of venous photo-plethysmography (VPPG) as a way of measuring the forearm swelling that may result from positional venous compression during a 90\u25e6 abduction test (10) and showed that fingertip V-PPG cannot replace forearm VPPG for estimating venous outflow (11). VPPG is of interest because it is easily performed, low-cost, observer-independent and it allows continuous and bilateral forearm volume recordings. Unfortunately, VPPG is a semi-quantitative technique (12); the amplitude of VPPG changes is not reliable from one patient to another or with changes in probe positions (13\u2013 15). Consequently, how can we know whether the forearm is completely emptied during upper limb abduction? We proposed the Ca-Pra maneuver in the sitting or standing position (a modified version of the Roos test) as a way of answering this puzzling question (10). For the Ca-Pra maneuver, following 90\u25e6 abduction (as in the surrender/candlestick: \u201cCa\u201d position) we asked the patient to move the elbows forward while keeping the hands elevated at the same level as in the \u201cCa\u201d position. This second position mimics the prayer \u201cPra\u201d attitude and opens the costo-clavicular angle. It is then expected that in normal subjects no emptying (VPPG increase) shall occur\nwhen moving from \u201cCa\u201d to \u201cPra\u201d and VPPG should remain almost stable. On the contrary, if a venous outflow occurs in \u201cCa,\u201d moving the arm to \u201cPra\u201d shall result in an increase in the VPPG signal (further venous emptying resulting from incomplete emptying in the \u201cCa\u201d position). Then, by allowing the recording of the VPPG value observed during complete emptying in all patients (10), the Ca-Pra maneuver allows for a quantitative analysis of the otherwise semi-quantitative VPPG technique (12).\nThe degree of emptying (percentage of maximal VPPG signal: %PPGmax) that should be used to discriminate normal from abnormal outflow has never been reported. Our aim was to determine this value using the presence of a compression on ultrasound investigation as a reference."

Ten were < 18 years and were not included in the database and US results were available for 442 of the other 475 patients. Of these patients, 51 did not have a PPG recording due to the ELCAT system being unavailable or due to technical failure on one or both sides. We then had 424 patients (848 upper limbs). A description of these patients is reported in Table 1.\nAs shown, patients were predominantly female. Half of the patients took painkillers on a regular basis. Sixteen of the patients did not report pain by history but were investigated for chronic forearm swelling, Raynaud syndrome or unexplained distal emboli. One hundred and forty-six (34.4%) patients had an ultrasound investigation reporting a venous compression on the right side (n= 41), left side (n= 44), or bilaterally (n= 61). As shown in Figure 2, absolute values for PPG at the end of the \u201cCa\u201d period were extremely heterogeneous with 158 (18.6%) values being 100%PPGmax.\nTypical examples of A-PPG recording in a patient with unilateral symptoms are presented in Figure 3. As shown, after an initial emptying, V-PPG absolute values could reach negative values during the \u201cCa\u201d phase of the Ca-Pra maneuver (suggesting the presence of a persistent arterial inflow forcing blood into the vein while outflow is impaired) until elbow are moved forward and veins reach full emptying.\nTable 2 and Figure 4 show the result of ROC curve analysis on a limb-by-limb basis. As shown in Table 2, neither the absolute value of End-Ca-PPG nor PPGmax are significantly predictive of the presence of a venous compression at imaging. As shown, in Figure 4 the optimal cutoff point for End-Ca-PPG to predict the presence of a venous compression at ultrasound was 87%PPGmax. It is interesting to note that End-Ca-PPG values < 87%PPGmax were noted in 447 (52.7%) of the upper limbs. In 65 limbs (7.7% of the recordings) End-Ca-PPG was equal to or lower than zero, while in almost all cases PPG\nincreased initially (forearm emptying) at the beginning of the candlestick period.

            "text": "This is the first study to report a quantitative analysis of VPP in patients with suspected TOS. As shown, an EndCa-PPG of 87%PPGmax during the Ca-Pra maneuver is the optimal cut-off point to differentiate complete from incomplete upper limb emptying during 90\u25e6 abduction. End-Ca-PPG values of < 87%PPGmax were found in 52.7% of recordings, suggesting\nthat venous outflow impairment is very frequent in patients with suspected TOS.\nPlethysmography is the generic name for various techniques that aim to measure the changes in the volume of tissue in humans (12, 13, 16). Among the available techniques are strain gauge plethysmography, conductance plethysmography, air plethysmography and photo-plethysmography (PPG) (17\u2013 22). Regardless of the technique used, there are generally\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 05 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 4 Determination of the threshold to be used for End-Ca-PPG (expressed as %PPGmax) to predict the presence of a venous compression on ultrasound imaging. The arrow represents the shortest distance to the angle and corresponds to a 87%PPGmax value.\ntwo signals that can be extracted from the plethysmography signal. The first one corresponds to the small rhythmic changes resulting from arterial pulsatility and can be separated from the raw signal by a high-pass filter (23). The second one is a slow but ample component that mainly results from venous volume changes and can be obtained by applying a low-pass filter to the raw PPG signal (13, 24, 25). In patients with TOS, the high-pass filtered PPG signal (arterial pulsatility) has been largely studied (26\u201329), whereas low-pass filtered PPG (venous PPG) has scarcely been studied (10, 30). The specific interests of the Ca-Pra maneuver are to confirm whether venous emptying was impaired in abduction (\u201cCa\u201d phase) and to change the semi-quantitative PPG technique (12) into a quantitative tool. In our previous report we showed that the V-PPG signal could be classified into 4 different patterns, two of which were assumed to result from venous outflow impairment and show venous emptying in the transition from \u201cCa\u201d to \u201cPra.\u201d Although pattern analysis is of interest, it is not an easy approach in routine use. The calculation of the value at the end of the \u201cCa\u201d period, expressed as %PPGmax, is easy to apply as routine and should facilitate V-PPG analysis in TOS-suspected patients in the future.\nThe sensitivity and accuracy reported for V-PPG detecting a venous positional compression in our series of recordings may appear low, but we did not expect a higher performance. Indeed, when used as a reference technique, ultrasound is the best\u2013but probably not the ideal - candidate. First, application of the US probe to the proximal vein could have potentially interfered with venous outflow, specifically through eventual compression of collateral superficial vessels by the US probe. Second, the presence of a positional compression of the subclavian vein cannot be predictive of outflow impairment in\nall cases because collateral veins are able to normalize outflow despite subclavian positional compression (31). Third, it has been repeatedly reported that the sensitivity of US in detecting venous compression or occlusion is not optimal, even in trained hands and even in cases of chronic occlusion, due to bone structures making it difficult to visualize the vein at the level of compression (4). Overall, it must be kept in mind that PPG and ultrasound do not evaluate the same thing. While ultrasound detects the presence or absence of a compression, PPG evaluates the hemodynamic consequence of a compression. Then it is not surprising that the negative predictive value of PPG was high.\nIssues might also result from the PPG technique itself (12, 32). First, small differences in elbow altitude relative to heart level may exist despite the recommendation to the patients to keep elbow level constant. This may result in small changes in PPG value. This fully justifies the need to determine the optimal End-Ca-PPG value and not consider values lower than 100% as abnormal. Second, extrapolation to the forearm volume from the local light absorption close to the elbow may appear to be a limitation when compared to air plethysmography (which would better account for the whole forearm volume). We believe that, on the contrary, it is an advantage for PPG. Indeed, in cases of isolated venous occlusion (without arterial occlusion) the elevated forearm will fill from the bottom to the top due to gravity and this is more likely to be rapidly recordable close to the elbow than at the wrist level. Clearly strain gauges would do the same as PPG; strain gauges have the ability to be calibrated, but they are more expensive (12, 33, 34). Furthermore, the advantage of calibrating the strain gauge recorded response compared to PPG is lost in our approach, since quantification is provided for PPG by the estimation of complete emptying during the \u201cPra\u201d phase of the test. Third, and as previously discussed, PPG may remain normal despite positional occlusion of the subclavian vein due to collateral vessels. For example, it has been suggested that 2\u20135% of patients have a pre-clavicular vein draining blood directly to the jugular vein (35). Although this may appear to be a limitation of the PPG technique, we believe that, on the contrary, it is of major interest. Indeed, that which is clinically meaningful is forearm swelling, not venous occlusion itself. We believe that the tolerance of venous attitudinal compression depends on its hemodynamic consequences rather than the presence or absence of compression. Forth and last, the present analysis, with a value at the end of the \u201cCa\u201d period, does not discriminate between outflow impairment with arterial inflow impairment and outflow impairment without arterial inflow impairment. The former should result in arrested and stable PPG during the \u201cCa\u201d phase, whereas the latter should result in forearm filling from the patent artery before emptying occurs when moving in \u201cPra.\u201d A low value at the end of the \u201cCa\u201d period suggests that venous outflow impairment occurred but only PPG pattern classification will indicate whether arterial inflow was simultaneously present in most cases. Only a negative\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 06 frontiersin.org\nvalue at the end of the \u201cCa\u201d period is indicative of a persistent arterial inflow with arrested outflow, with forearm volume exceeding the resting volume due to venous pressure exceeding the hydrostatic pressure of the resting state.\nThere are also some potential issues with the maneuvers that we used. First, sub-occlusion of the veins can result in slowed outflow but then result in complete emptying during the 30-s duration of the \u201cCa\u201d position. We did observe this phenomenon in some patients. Analyzing the initial slope of PPG change could be proposed to account for these slowed outflows, but the speed of upper limb elevation cannot be standardized, and slow abduction would result in slow PPG changes. Another solution would have been to shorten the duration of the \u201cCa\u201d period, but this would have masked the refilling that occurs because of persistent arterial inflow. On the contrary, the \u201cCa\u201d period is probably too short to allow symptoms of upper limb congestion to develop. This is the reason why we did not focus on symptoms in the present study. Second, the 30-s duration is a compromise and other durations would probably result in different values at the end of the \u201cCa\u201d period, but the total duration of recording of the Elcat R\u00a9 device that we used cannot be extended above 1 min.\nThe absence of information on cardiac function or arrhythmia could be suggested as an issue on PPG signals. Nevertheless, the effect of arrhythmia on pulse variability would indeed interfere with pulse PPG but has little, if any, influence on VPPG. Second, the presence of cardiac failure in a population of young subjects (although we had one single patient older than 70 years old) is very unlikely.\nLastly, the fact that we did not simultaneously record PPG with ultrasound could be criticized. Nevertheless, the maneuvers for the ultrasound investigations are rarely performed simultaneously on both sides and imaging with ultrasound cannot be simultaneous on both sides."
