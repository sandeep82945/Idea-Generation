1. **Investigate the use of additional machine-learning methods:** The proposed model ensemble could be further improved by incorporating additional machine-learning methods. This could include methods such as gradient boosting machines, support vector regression with different kernels, or deep neural networks. By combining the strengths of different methods, it may be possible to achieve even more accurate predictions.


2. **Explore the use of different input variables:** The choice of input variables can have a significant impact on the accuracy of load forecasts. In this study, a set of input variables was selected based on the literature and trial and error. However, it is possible that there are other input variables that could be used to improve the accuracy of the forecasts. Future research could explore the use of different input variables, such as weather data from multiple locations, historical load data from multiple substations, or data from smart meters.


3. **Develop a method for online implementation of the model:** The proposed model is currently designed for offline use. However, it could be adapted for online implementation, which would allow it to be used to make real-time predictions. This would require developing a method for updating the model's weights in real time, as well as a method for handling missing or corrupted data.


4. **Investigate the use of the model for other types of load forecasting:** The proposed model could be adapted for use in other types of load forecasting, such as forecasting the load of a specific customer or group of customers, or forecasting the load of a specific type of appliance. This would require collecting data on the load of the specific customer or appliance, and then training the model on this data.


5. **Develop a method for quantifying the uncertainty of the forecasts:** The proposed model does not currently provide a measure of the uncertainty of the forecasts. This is an important limitation, as it makes it difficult to use the forecasts to make decisions. Future research could develop a method for quantifying the uncertainty of the forecasts, which would allow users to make more informed decisions.
