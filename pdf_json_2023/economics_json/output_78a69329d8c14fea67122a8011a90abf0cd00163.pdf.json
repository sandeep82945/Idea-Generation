ABSTRACT Objective This study aimed to explore the perspectives of key decision makers on outofpocket (OOP) payment for medicines and its implications in the Ethiopian healthcare system. Design A qualitative design that employed audiorecorded semistructured indepth interviews was used in this study. The framework thematic analysis approach was followed in the analysis. Setting Interviewees came from five federallevel institutions engaged in policymaking (three) and tertiary referrallevel healthcare service provision (two) in Ethiopia. Participants Seven pharmacists, five health officers, one medical doctor and one economist who held key decisionmaking positions in their respective organisations participated in the study. Result Three major themes were identified in the areas of the current context of OOP payment for medicines, its aggravating factors and a plan to reduce its burden. Under the current context, participants\u2019 overall opinions, circumstances of vulnerability and consequences on households were identified. Factors identified as aggravating the burden of OOP payment were deficiencies in the medicine supply chain and limitations in the health insurance system. Suggested mitigation strategies to be implemented by the health providers, the national medicines supplier, the insurance agency and the Ministry of Health were categorised under plans to reduce OOP payment. Conclusion The findings of this study indicate that there is widespread OOP payment for medicines in Ethiopia. System level constraints such as weaknesses in the supply system at the national and health facility levels have been identified as critical factors that undermine the protective effects of health insurance in the Ethiopian context. Ensuring steady access to essential medicines requires addressing health system and supply constraints in addition to a wellfunctioning financial risk protection systems.",

According to the WHO, OOP healthcare expenditure is considered catastrophic if it amounts to more than or equals 40% of non- food household expenditure or 10% of total household consumption.7 Due to the absence of robust financial protection mechanisms, OOP is a common mode of payment for healthcare, often leading to catastrophic expenditures, in many developing countries.1 4 Households could experience economic or psychological consequences as a result of OOP payment.8 For example, stress, poverty and health complications (as a result\nSTRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY \u21d2 The qualitative design of the study allowed an indepth understanding of the situation of medicine out- of- pocket payments from the perspectives of key decision makers at different levels of the health system in Ethiopia. \u21d2 The study respondents were policymakers and healthcare providers and do not necessarily represent the views of patients and caregivers. \u21d2 Data based on individuals\u2019 opinions could be subject to potential respondent bias.\nP atna).

According to the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) data from 2016 to 2017, 31% of the health finance system raised funds from OOP payments by consumers.16 Hence, based on the 2015/2016 national representative survey, approximately 2% of households encountered catastrophic health expenses (at 10% of total household expenditure), with about 0.9% forced into poverty as a result of excessive health OOP payments.17 Despite encouraging results, the Ethiopian healthcarefinancing system is still a long way from ensuring the universal health coverage targets due to reliance on OOP and resource constraints.18\u201320 The health- financing system relies on health insurance (typically through the implementation of community- based health insurance (CBHI)), a fee waiver scheme, the retention of collected revenue at health facilities and the empowerment of public health facilities to focus on clinical services.21\u201323 However, despite the increase in the number of people enrolled in CBHI, the proportion has remained low.24 Consequently, the majority of Ethiopian households are dependent on OOP health expenses.25\nOver the last two decades, patient OOP spending on prescribed medicines has increased globally, accounting for a larger share of household and national health spending.26 Particularly, OOP medicine expenses remain the primary payment option for households in SSA countries. For example, according to the studies done in SSA countries, payment for medicines was not only the largest but also the most expensive type of health service OOP expenditure.27 28 Generally, a large number of people endure financial hardships as a result of the high cost of medicines.8 9 Nearly 7% and 3% (38 million) of the population in the Philippines and India were pushed below the poverty line due to OOP payments for medicine, respectively.29 30 In Ethiopia, medicines constitute the most expensive component of healthcare services.31 32 The likelihood of catastrophic health expenditure can be influenced by factors such as availability, capacity to pay and the lack of effective protection mechanisms (eg, health insurance).18\nGiven the high proportion of OOP expenditures on medicines, a large number of the Ethiopian population is\nbeing pushed into poverty.33 In the Ethiopian context, the data on OOP payments for medicines come from surveys and national- level household consumption expenditure studies. Hence, there is a paucity of evidence on the system level contexts and constraints resulting in the high burden and impact of the OOP payments for medicines in the country. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to explore the level of OOP payment for medicines and its implications from the perspectives of key decisionmakers in the Ethiopian healthcare system."

A semistructured, open- ended interview guide with flexible probing techniques was employed (see online supplemental file 1). The overall goal of the interview was to address a variety of topics related to participants\u2019 understanding of the current status of medicine OOP payment and its consequences on patients, caregivers, households and the country, and the implementation of strategies for the promotion of access to medicine and financial risk protection interventions to combat catastrophic medicine OOP expenditure. Participants from hospitals were further asked their views on the practice of their respective hospital\u2019s non- cash delivery healthcare service utilisation, funding and patient economic status. During the interviews, the assessment of participants concerning the effectiveness of interventions that had been implemented over the previous 10 years was also discussed. By its very design, the study followed an iterative approach where interviews were done with one informant influenced the subsequent interviews.\nGAM gathered the information from the interview. The Amharic language aided the interview, and the audio was recorded after gaining informed consent. Before the interview, sociodemographic information such as gender, degree of training and certification, and years of experience in the current role was obtained. The interviews followed an emergent approach where prior interviews were used to improve the interview guide and include critical questions for the next interview.34 The interviewer had taken detailed notes of the interview with two of the participants (one from FMOH and the other from TASH) who declined to be audio recorded. In all cases, the interviewer had taken field notes at the end of each interview. The occurrence of information saturation dictated the final number of participants. Saturation was determined by the absence of new information from the interview with the next person. After saturation was detected, three interviews were conducted in a row to see if any new codes or themes emerged. The length of the recorded interviews ranged from 25 to 40 min."

In the analysis, data were selected, charted and organised under key ideas and themes using five steps such as familiarisation, identifying a thematic framework, indexing, charting, and mapping and interpretation. Following the completion of the interview, we carefully listened to the audio and studied the transcription details and field notes to overview the collected data. As a result, we familiarised ourselves with future themes and important messages and made a mental note of them. The thematic framework was identified by classifying the important issues and concepts based on the notes taken during familiarisation. The coding was flexible to add codes when a new concept of participants was identified during the analysis. The third step was indexing; in this stage, we developed subthemes of coded data followed by themes that formed from particular subthemes. Charting involved placing or ordering the themes and subthemes consistently to allow convenient research reporting. Finally, an explanation and recommendations were made. The relevance of the idea, possible connections between concepts and compliance with the research purpose have all been checked throughout the analysis processes."

Overall, the participants considered OOP healthcare service payments as a widespread problem in the country. Even the insured and individuals eligible for subsidised services were not immune to OOP health expenditures. Payment for medicines was identified as one of the major reasons for OOP payment. Patients in urban areas, those who had to go to the emergency room and those with non- communicable disorders were also more likely to be charged OOP medicine payments.\nRegarding the impact of medicine OOP payment in Ethiopia, many of the participants agreed that the cost of medicines is expensive as compared with other healthcare services, and it could lead to impoverishment as it could expose households to high loans and the sale of property. Additional consequences of OOP payments mentioned by participants include a decrease in community healthcareseeking behaviour, driving households to illegal institutions and affecting the nation\u2019s economic well- being (table 2).\nAggravating factors for medicine OOP payment Deficits in the medicines supply chain and limitations in the health insurance system were two recurring ideas highlighted under this theme (figure 1). Each of the two concepts is discussed in more detail below."

            "text": "According to participants, the reason for frequent medicine stockouts in public health institutions ranges\nfrom challenges within the health facility to nationwide supply chain issues. Inadequate health facility medicine budgets and low- forecasting capabilities were noted as facility- level issues contributing to medicine shortages. Nationally, foreign currency shortages, the involvement of multiple actors at various levels of the pharmaceutical supply chain and procedural hurdles contributed to supply challenges. Foreign currency shortages have been accused of causing protracted delays in the procurement of pharmaceuticals, resulting in market shortages. As participants indicated, the drug supply chain management process involves a variety of parties with varying capacities and interests. Participants named stakeholders such as national pharmaceuticals regulators, airlines, shipping lines, purchasers, banks and the customs authority as important actors. The lack of coordination in their efforts was identified as a key source of medicine shortages. Procedural hurdles such as delays in purchase approvals and clearance for the release of acquired goods by the Ethiopian Food and Drug Administration contributed to problems in the timely availability of medicines (figure 1).\nAccording to participants, the unavailability of medicines in public healthcare facilities forces patients to purchase them from the private sector at higher prices. Some participants also claimed that private pharmacies that are aware of the lack of medicines in the public sector raise their already high costs dramatically. Participants from the insurance agency claimed to have stopped reimbursing medicine expenditures due to widespread stockouts in various parts of the country, implying that\nFigure 1 Aggravating factors for medicine out- of- pocket (OOP) payment in Ethiopia, 2021.\nP atna).

Although the number of administrative units (woredas) offering the CBHI has expanded substantially, there are still certain obstacles. The low number of enrolled households, the national health insurance agency\u2019s inability to implement planned and/or better reimbursement policies and guidelines, the health sector\u2019s weak system of checks and balances, the insurance system\u2019s financial constraints and the low level of government subsidy were all mentioned as potential factors that limit the types of services and medicines covered by the insurance system (figure 1). According to participants from EHIA and FMOH, many of the policies\nand strategies designed to institute a functional insurance system in the previous 5 to 10 years were either not executed or had limitations during implementation. The failure to implement SHI, limitations in the implementation of the third- party contract strategy and the difficulty of issuing a proclamation making CBHI membership mandatory were cited as the primary issues in this respect (figure 1).\nPlan to reduce OOP medicine payment Participants were asked if their institutions have any plans to decrease the impact of OOP payment in the future (table 3). Participants from the EHIA disclosed their preparations to implement the SHI system, in addition to plans to expand the CBHI coverage.

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "The analysis shows that the interviewees and their respective institutions understand the extent and impact of high OOP medicine payment in the Ethiopian healthcare system. It was indicated that OOP payments on medicine are currently the most expensive component of healthcare service expenses, which could potentially lead households to impoverishment. These findings were in agreement with the quantitative analysis based on the household report in 2010/2011 and 2015/2016 Ethiopian surveys.33 These findings could imply the significance of OOP medicine payment in the healthcarefinancing system in Ethiopia. The high prevalence of OOP medicine payments was also reported by other developing countries.4 In our context, patients residing in urban areas, those who had to go to the emergency room and those with non- communicable diseases were listed as more likely exposed to high medicine OOP payments. Similarly, several studies, including those done in Ethiopia, reported that socioeconomic status, type of disease, type of healthcare service (inpatient/outpatient service) and health insurance status were frequently identified as contributing factors in the incidence of catastrophic medicine expenditure among households.33 36 37 However, further explorations from a household perspective are required. Because the listed factors in this study are only the perception of participants from decision makers, they do not necessarily represent the views of patients and caregivers.\nThe current study revealed the potential role of the actions and inactions of federal level institutions such as policymakers and healthcare providers in exacerbating the impact of OOP payment on medicine in the Ethiopian healthcare system. In this regard, one of the findings as an aggravating factor was the insufficient medicine supply system, which resulted in frequent medicine stockouts in public healthcare facilities. A framework of challenges was developed with input from the national medicine supply agency and healthcare providers. Similarly, other studies have found that medicines were frequently unavailable in Ethiopian public health facilities.32 38 These findings emphasised the significance of resolving medicine supply chain issues in public healthcare facilities. This is particularly important because purchasing medicines in the\nprivate sector can be costly for low- income households.39 For example, in Ghana, due to a lack of medicine in public healthcare facilities, most households (including the insured) incurred catastrophic OOP medicine purchases from private sources.40 The second aggravating factor investigated in this study was limitations in the health insurance system. Hence, the CBHI has only covered a few medicines. The finding was consistent with another study done in Ethiopia.41 This could imply that insured patients might have to pay OOP for medicines that are not covered by their insurance scheme. This is important because failures in the insurance system are more often linked to socioeconomic devastations as a result of OOP health payments.14 The other revealed challenge was a limitation in the implementation of policies and strategies prepared in the respective institutions. The majority of interventions, particularly those related to health insurance, encountered implementation limitations, which was consistent with other findings in the Ethiopian context. For example, recent studies in Ethiopia reported that implemented financial risk protection strategies are insufficient.42\u201347 Recognising that the Ethiopian government has been implementing a fee waiver mechanism for the poor since 2004, it was reported that it was ineffective to target the beneficiaries, citing limited service coverage, ineffective poor targeting and poor documentation as some of the reasons.48 49 The consequences of household financial insecurity can be exacerbated by the presence of high poverty prevalence and healthcare accessibility challenges in developing countries.50\nThe findings of this study may lead to a better understanding of the impact of medicine OOP payment on healthcare accessibility. The current context of OOP medicine payment in the healthcare- financing system can be an indicator of the effectiveness status of various financial risk protection policies implemented in Ethiopia. Despite the protective impact of strategies such as health insurance, fee waiver systems and national medicine supply systems, it should be noted that the desired protection is yet to come. Therefore, various strategies could be considered to prevent high OOP medicine payment and its consequences. Thus, addressing financial access barriers (such as prepayment packages and borrowed funds), enhancing financial policies (such as SHI or population- based tax- funded health- financing systems) and enhancing medicine availability and affordability are all beneficial.4 51 Furthermore, efficient implementation of existing policies, preparing financial protection policies focusing on access to medicines and other innovative strategies are required to combat the financial burden due to medicine OOP payment."

            "text": "The findings of this study suggested that OOP medicine payments play the largest role when consumers face financial burdens due to health expenditures, and key informants from policymakers and healthcare providers indicated that their institutions contributed to the impact. From their perspective, the situation was aggravated further by a lack of medicine supply chain capacity, limitation of the health insurance system and lack of financial protection policies and initiatives focusing on access to medicines. This implies that people, particularly the poor, have been facing devastating consequences such as catastrophic health expenditures and difficulty accessing quality healthcare services. In general, the findings of this study can be used as a framework for further assessment and analysis of access to medicine and the financial risk reduction programme in Ethiopia\u2019s healthcare- financing system. This might be managed by identifying the current context of OOP payment on medicine, the status of interventions pertaining to access to medicine and financial risk protection, and policy implementation challenges.\nAuthor affiliations 1Department of Pharmacy, College of Health Sciences, Arba Minch University, Arba Minch, Ethiopia 2Clinical Trials Directorate, Armauer Hansen Research Institute, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia 3Department of Pharmacy, Madda Walabu University, Robe, Ethiopia 4Department of Social and Administrative Pharmacy, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia 5Department of Pharmaceutics and Social Pharmacy, Addis Ababa University College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\nTwitter Eskinder Eshetu Ali @AEskinder\nAcknowledgements We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to all of the study participants for their insights during the in- depth interviews.\nContributors All the concerned authors of this study are men.
