We define a large hole island below G3 and G4 to be used simultaneously as a reservoir and as a charge sensor for a single hole trapped in a quantum dot, QD2, under G2. Single-shot readout of this hole spin is performed by means of a spin-to-charge conversion technique based on the real-time detection of spin-selective tunnelling to the reservoir, a widely used method often referred to as \u2018Elzerman readout\u201924. Tunnelling events are detected by dispersive radiofrequency reflectometry on the charge sensor (see Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1 for technical details).\nIn our device geometry, the first holes primarily accumulate in the upper corners of the silicon nanowire25. Figure 1c displays the expected single-hole wave function in QD2, computed with a finite-differences k \u22c5 p model including the six topmost valence bands26 (see Methods and Supplementary Information, section 1). At low energy, that is, close to the valence-band edge, the hole wave function primarily contains heavy-hole (HH) and light-hole (LH) components. The strong two-axes confinement readily seen in Fig. 1c favours HH\u2013LH mixing27,28. This mixing is expected to manifest in the anisotropy of the hole g-tensor, which carries information on the relative weight of the HH and LH components29\u201331. To verify this, we measure the hole spin resonance frequency fL while varying the orientation of the magnetic field B in the xz and yz planes. The effective g-factor g = hfL/(\u03bcB\u2223B\u2223) (with \u03bcB the Bohr magneton and h the Planck constant) is plotted in Fig. 1d,e as a function of the magnetic field angles \u03b8zx and \u03b8zy, respectively.

Spin electric susceptibility, however, renders these qubits generally vulnerable to electrical noise, which limits their coherence time. Here we report on a spin\u2013orbit qubit consisting of a single hole electrostatically confined in a natural silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor device. By varying the magnetic field orientation, we reveal the existence of operation sweet spots where the impact of charge noise is minimized while preserving an efficient electric-dipole spin control. We correspondingly observe an extension of the Hahn-echo coherence time up to 88 \u03bcs, exceeding by an order of magnitude existing values reported for hole spin qubits, and approaching the state-of-the-art for electron spin qubits with synthetic spin\u2013orbit coupling in isotopically purified silicon.

The calculated g-factors are also plotted in the same figures as coloured solid lines. The agreement with the experimental data is remarkable. From the numerical simulation, we conclude that the measured g-factor anisotropy results from a strong electrical confinement against the side facet of the channel (along y), which prevails over the mostly structural vertical confinement (along x). The experimental g-factors and the small misalignment between the principal axes of the g-tensor and the device symmetry axes are best reproduced by introducing a moderate amount of charge disorder in combination with small (\u223c0.1%) shear strains in the silicon channel (Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3, and Supplementary Information, section 1). The latter probably originate from device processing and thermal contraction at the measurement temperature32."

            "text": "Given that the g-factor anisotropy is intimately related to the HH\u2013 LH mixing, which is controlled by the electrostatic confinement potential, the Larmor frequency is expected to be gate-voltage dependent. As a consequence, the hole spin coherence must be generally susceptible to charge noise. We thus measure the longitudinal spin-electric susceptibility (LSES) with respect to the voltages applied to the lateral gate G1 and to the accumulation gate G2, which we define as LSESG1 = \u2202fL\u2202VG1 and LSESG2 = \u2202fL \u2202VG2 , respectively. In essence, LSESG1 and LSESG2 characterize the response of the Larmor frequency to the electric-field components parallel (z) and perpendicular (x,y) to the channel direction, respectively.\nTo probe the response to G2, we directly measure the spin resonance frequency fL at different VG2 (Extended Data Fig. 4). The resulting LSESG2 is plotted as a function of the magnetic field angle \u03b8zx in Fig. 2a. The observed angular dependence is in good agreement with the theoretical expectation.\nNoticeably, LSESG2 is positive along x and negative along z. Indeed, when increasing VG2, the hole wave function extends proportionally more in the yz plane than in the vertical x direction, which increases gx and decreases gy and gz (Extended Data Fig. 2b and Supplementary Information, section 1). As a result of the sign change, LSESG2 vanishes at two magnetic field orientations in the xz plane (marked by arrows in Fig. 2a), which are sweet spots for electric-field fluctuations perpendicular to the silicon channel.\nTo probe the response to G1, we introduce a pulse on VG1 in a Hahn-echo sequence4 as outlined in Fig. 2b. This defines a phase gate, controlled by the amplitude \u03b4VG1 and duration \u03c4z of the pulse. Figure 2b displays the coherent oscillations recorded as a function of \u03c4z for three different pulse amplitudes. The frequency of these oscillations is expected to increase linearly with \u03b4VG1, with a slope LSESG1 = \u2202fL\u2202VG1 . This is shown in Fig. 2c for different magnetic field orientations. LSESG1, plotted in Fig. 2d as a function of \u03b8zx, ranges from \u22120.5 MHz mV\u22121 to \u22120.1 MHz mV\u22121. Its magnitude is much smaller than that of LSESG2 because G1 is further from QD2 than G2 and its field effect is partly screened by the hole gas beneath. The numerically calculated LSESG1 (solid line) reproduces reasonably well the order of magnitude but not the angular dependence of the measured LSESG1. This discrepancy may be due to inaccuracies in the description of the hole gases near QD2 and to unaccounted charge disorder and strains (see discussion in Supplementary\n0\u00b0\n30\u00b0\n60\u00b0 90\u00b0Bias tee VG2 120\u00b0\n150\u00b0\n180\u00b0\n210\u00b0\n240\u00b0 270\u00b0 300\u00b0\n330\u00b0\n0 1\n2\n0\u00b0\n30\u00b0\n60\u00b0 90\u00b0 120\u00b0\n150\u00b0\n180\u00b0\n210\u00b0\n240\u00b0 270\u00b0 300\u00b0\n330\u00b0\n0 1\n2\nzy\nzx\nzx\nzy\nVG3 VG4\nInductor\nDrainSource\nMW2 a d\neb c\nMW1 VG1\nG1 x\ny z\nx\ny z\nG2 G3 G4\nBOX\nGate oxide G2\nBOX\nSilicon\nFig. 1 | Device, measurement scheme and properties of the first confined hole. a, Simplified three-dimensional representation of a silicon (yellow)-on-insulator (green) nanowire device with four gates (light blue) labelled G1, G2, G3 and G4.

We also notice that LSESG1 never vanishes and that the minimum of \u2223LSESG1\u2223 happens to be almost at the same \u03b8zx as a zero of LSESG2.\nCoherence times and frequency-dependent noise contributions We now turn to the angular dependence of the hole spin coherence time and investigate its correlation with the longitudinal spin-electric susceptibility33. To get rid of low-frequency noise sources, we measure the coherence time using a conventional Hahn-echo protocol2. The control sequence, applied to G1 (see upper inset of Fig. 3a), consists of \u03c0x/2, \u03c0y and \u03c0\u03d5/2 pulses separated by a time delay \u03c4wait/2. For each \u03c4wait, we extract the averaged amplitude of the P\u2191 oscillation obtained by varying the phase \u03d5 of the last \u03c0/2 pulse, and normalize it to the P\u2191 oscillation amplitude in the zero-delay limit.\nA representative Hahn-echo plot is shown in Fig. 3a. We fit the echo amplitude to an exponential decay exp(\u2212(\u03c4wait/TE2) \u03b2 ), where the exponent \u03b2 is left as a free parameter. The best fit is obtained for \u03b2 = 1.5 \u00b1 0.1, which implies a high-frequency noise with a characteristic spectrum S(f) = Shf(f0/f)\u03b1, where f0 = 1 Hz is a reference frequency and \u03b1 = \u03b2 \u2212 1 \u2248 0.5 (we note that the same \u03b1 value was reported for hole spin qubits in germanium10).\nTo explore the angular dependence of TE2 in the xz plane, we measure the decay of the Hahn-echo amplitude for different values of \u03b8zx. The results, shown in Fig. 3b, reveal a strong anisotropy, with TE2 ranging from 15 \u03bcs to 88 \u03bcs. Strikingly, the spin coherence time peaks at \u03b8zx = 99\u00b0, an angle between the minimum of \u2223LSESG1\u2223 and a zero of LSESG2, highlighting a correlation with the correspondingly suppressed electrical noise. The extended coherence time is much longer than previously reported for hole spin qubits in both\nsilicon (1.5 \u03bcs (ref. 15)) and germanium (3.8 \u03bcs (ref. 23))34. In addition, we notice that spin control remains efficient at all angles including \u03b8zx = 99\u2218, where we could readily achieve Rabi frequencies FRabi as large as 5 MHz limited by the attenuation on the microwave line. The echo quality factor QE = FRabi \u00d7 TE2 also peaks at \u03b8zx = 99\u00b0, reaching QE \u2248 440 with further room for improvement (Supplementary Information, section 2 and Extended Data Fig. 5).\nThe observed angular dependence of TE2 can be understood by assuming that the electrical noise is the sum of uncorrelated voltage fluctuations on the different gates Gi with respective spectral densities SGi(f) = ShfGi(f0/f)0.5. Given the Hahn-echo noise filter function, the decoherence rate can then be expressed as (Supplementary Information, section 3):\n1 TE2 \u2248 7.8f1/30\n(\n\u2211\ni\n(\n\u2202fL \u2202VGi )2 ShfGi\n)2/3\n. (1)\nUsing the longitudinal spin-electric susceptibilities from Fig. 2a\u2013d and leaving the weights ShfGi as adjustable parameters, we achieve a remarkable agreement with the experimental TE2 (coloured solid line in Fig. 3b). This strongly supports the hypothesis that the Hahn-echo coherence time is limited by electrical noise. As already argued before, LSESG1 and LSESG2 indeed quantify the susceptibility of the hole spin to electric field fluctuations parallel and perpendicular to the channel, respectively.\nThe best fit in Fig. 3b is obtained with ShfG1 = (1.7 \u03bcV/ \u221a Hz)2 and ShfG2 = (66 nV/ \u221a\nHz)2. We speculate that the large ShfG1/ShfG2 ratio results from an artificial enhancement of ShfG1 accounting for hidden sources of electric field fluctuations along the silicon nanowire.\n0\n0.5\nP \u2191\n0\n0.5\nP \u2191\n0 1 2 3 4 5\n0\n0.5\nP \u2191\na\nc d\nb\n2 2\nControl MeasureInitialize\nVG1\nVG2\n1 2 3 4 5 \u03b4VG1 (mV)\n0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n\u2223f L (\u03b4\nV G\n1 )\u2013\nf0 L \u2223 (\nM H\nz)\n\u03b8zx = 90\u00b0 \u03b8zx = 42\u00b0 \u03b8zx = 0\u00b0\n0 45 90 135 180 \u201315.0\n\u201312.5\n\u201310.0\n\u20137.5\n\u20135.0\n\u20132.5\n0\n2.5\n0 45 90 135 180\n\u20131.50\n\u20131.25\n\u20131.00\n\u20130.75\n\u20130.50\n\u20130.25\n0\n(M H\nz m\nV \u20131 ) \u2202f L\n\u2202V G\n2\n(M H\nz m\nV \u20131 ) \u2202f L\n\u2202V G\n1\n\u03c0x \u03c0x\u03c0y\u03b4VG1 \u03c4z\n\u03c4z (\u00b5s)\u03b8zx (deg)\n\u03b8zx (deg)\nFig. 2 | LSeS. a, Spin-electric susceptibility with respect to VG2 (LSESG2) as a function of magnetic field angle \u03b8zx (symbols), at constant fL = 19 GHz.

For reasons of symmetry, we expect LSESG3 to be comparable to LSESG1. A possible additional source of longitudinal electric field fluctuations are the randomly oscillating charges and dipoles in the silicon nitride spacers between the gates. Because these noise sources are closer to QD2 than is gate G1, and because they are much less screened by the hole gas beneath, they presumably make a large contribution to the apparent ShfG1 when lumped into \u221dLSESG1 terms.\nTo further investigate the hole spin coherence, we implement Carr\u2013Purcell\u2013Meiboom\u2013Gill (CPMG) sequences at the most favourable field orientation \u03b8zx = 99\u2218. These consist in increasing the number of \u03c0 pulses cancelling faster and faster dephasing mechanisms. Figure 3c displays the CPMG echo amplitudes as a function of the total waiting time \u03c4wait for series of N\u03c0 = 2n\u03c0 pulses, where n is an integer ranging from 1 to 8. The CPMG decay times TCPMG2 extracted from Fig. 3c (see caption) are plotted against N\u03c0 in Fig. 3d. As expected, the data points follow a power law TCPMG2 \u221d N\u03b3\u03c0, where \u03b3 = \u03b1\u03b1+1 for a \u221d1/f\u03b1 noise spectrum4. The best-fit value \u03b3 = 0.34 yields again \u03b1 \u2248 0.5. For the largest sequence of 256 \u03c0 pulses, we find TCPMG2 = 0.4ms, an exceptionally long coherence for a hole spin34.\nFinally, to gain insight into the low-frequency noise acting on the hole spin, we perform systematic measurements of the inhomogeneous dephasing time T\u22172. To this aim, we apply Ramsey control sequences consisting of two \u03c0/2 pulses separated by a variable delay \u03c4wait. Contrary to Hahn-echo, the dephasing induced by low-frequency noise sources is not cancelled due to the absence of\nthe refocusing \u03c0 pulse. Figure 4a displays P\u2191 for a series of identical Ramsey sequences recorded on an overall time frame of 1 h, with each sequence lasting approximately 5.5 s. The next step is to average P\u2191(\u03c4wait) on a subset of consecutive sequences measured within a total time tmeas. This way, an averaged Ramsey oscillation is obtained for each tmeas, the amplitude of which is fitted to a Gaussian-decay function yielding T\u22172 (tmeas). Representative Ramsey data sets and corresponding fits are shown in Fig. 4b for three values of tmeas. The inhomogeneous dephasing time decreases with increasing tmeas due to the contribution of noise components with lower and lower frequency. To unveil the angular dependence of T\u22172, we repeat the same measurement for different magnetic field orientations. The results are plotted in Fig. 4c for the same three values of tmeas. The overall anisotropy of the Hahn-echo decay time of Fig. 3b can still be identified, although it reduces at large tmeas starting from tmeas > 50 s.\nHowever, if the 1/f0.5 charge noise prevailed over the whole mHz to MHz range, T\u22172 would be \u223c50 \u03bcs when TE2 \u2248 88 \u03bcs (Supplementary Information, section 3), well above the 7 \u03bcs seen in Fig. 4c. The power spectrum S(f) at low frequency can be extracted from the data of Fig. 4a (Extended Data Fig. 6). This reveals a 1/f\u03b1 noise with \u03b1 closer to 1, and a power (at 1 Hz) four orders of magnitude larger than the one expected by extrapolating the high-frequency 1/f0.5 noise inferred from CPMG.

            "text": "We report on a spin qubit with electrical control and single-shot readout based on a single hole in a silicon nanowire device issued from an industrial-grade fabrication line. The hole wave function and corresponding g-factors could be modelled with an excellent level of accuracy in these types of devices, denoting a relatively low level of structural and charge disorder. The hole-spin coherence was found to be limited by a 1/f0.5 charge noise at high frequencies (104\u2212106 Hz), with a strong dependence on the magnetic-field orientation that could be faithfully accounted for by the spin-electric susceptibilities. A largely enhanced spin coherence was measured at the sweet-spot angle, far beyond the current state-of-the-art for hole-spin qubits and close to the best figures reported for 28Si electron-spin qubits electrically driven via a micromagnet. Our study of the inhomogeneous dephasing time revealed a much stronger noise at low frequencies (10\u22124\u221210\u22122 Hz) that could be partially ascribed to the expected hyperfine interaction. In this scenario, the possible introduction of isotopically purified silicon devices would lead to a significant improvement of hole\u2013spin coherence in the low-frequency range. Finally, we would like to emphasize that such sweet spots should be ubiquitous in hole spin qubit devices21, and that a careful design and choice of operation point can make them usefully robust to disorder (see example in Supplementary Information, section 1). The engineering of sweet spots should therefore open new opportunities for an efficient realization of multi-qubit or coupled spin-photon systems35.\nonline content Any methods, additional references, Nature Research reporting summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code availability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/ s41565-022-01196-z.\nReceived: 21 January 2022; Accepted: 18 July 2022; Published online: 22 September 2022"

            "text": "Device. The device is a four-gate silicon-on-insulator nanowire transistor fabricated in an industry-standard 300 mm CMOS platform11. The undoped [110]-oriented silicon nanowire channel is 17 nm thick and 100 nm wide. It is connected to wider boron-doped source and drain pads used as reservoirs of holes. The four wrapping gates (G1\u2013G4) are 40 nm long and are spaced by 40 nm. The gaps between adjacent gates and between the outer gates and the doped contacts are filled with silicon nitride (Si3N4) spacers. The gate stack consists of a 6-nm-thick SiO2 dielectric layer followed by a metallic bilayer with 6 nm of TiN and 50 nm of heavily doped polysilicon. The yield of the four-gate devices across the full 300 mm wafer reaches 90% and their room temperature characteristics exhibit excellent uniformity (see Supplementary Information, section 6 for details).\nDispersive readout. Similar to charge detection methods recently applied to silicon-on-insulator nanowire devices37,38, we accumulate a large hole island under gates G3 and G4, as sketched in Fig. 1a. The island acts both as a charge reservoir and electrometer for the quantum dot QD2 located under G2. However, unlike the aformentioned earlier implementations, the electrometer is sensed by radiofrequency dispersive reflectometry on a lumped element resonator connected to the drain rather than to a gate electrode. To this aim, a commercial surface-mount inductor (L = 240 nH) is wire bonded to the drain pad (see Extended Data Fig. 7 for the measurement set-up). This configuration involves a parasitic capacitance to ground Cp = 0.54 pF, leading to resonance frequency f = 449.81 MHz. The high value of the loaded quality factor Q \u2248 103 enables fast, high-fidelity charge sensing. We estimate a charge readout fidelity of 99.6% in 5 \u03bcs, which is close to the state-of-the-art for silicon MOS devices39. The resonator characteristic frequency experiences a shift at each Coulomb resonance of the hole island, that is, when the electrochemical potential of the island lines up with the drain Fermi energy. This leads to a dispersive shift in the phase \u03d5drain of the reflected radiofrequency signal, which is measured through homodyne detection.\nEnergy-selective single-shot readout of the spin state of the first hole in QD2. Extended Data Fig. 1a displays the stability diagram of the device as a function of VG2 and VG3 when a large quantum dot (acting as a charge sensor) is accumulated under gates G3 and G4. The dashed grey lines outline the charging events in the quantum dot QD2 under G2, detected as discontinuities in the Coulomb peak stripes of the sensor dot. The lever-arm parameter of gate G2 is \u03b1G2 \u2248 0.37 eV V\u22121, as inferred from temperature-dependence measurements. Comparatively, the lever-arm parameter of gate G1 with respect to the first hole under G2, \u03b1G1 \u2248 0.03 eV V\u22121, is much smaller. The charging energy, measured as the splitting between the first two charges, is U = 22 meV. Extended Data Fig. 1b shows a zoom on the stability diagram around the working point used for single-shot spin readout in the main text. The three points labelled Empty (E), Load (L) and Measure (M) are the successive stages of the readout sequence sketched in Extended Data Fig. 1c. The quantum dot is initially emptied (E) before loading (L) a hole with a random spin. Both spin states are separated by the Zeeman energy EZ = g\u03bcBB where g is the g-factor, \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton and B is the amplitude of the magnetic field. This opens a narrow window for energy-selective readout using spin to charge conversion40. Namely, we align at stage M the centre of the Zeeman split energy levels in QD2 with the chemical potential of the sensor. In this configuration, only the excited spin-up hole can tunnel out of QD2 while only spin-down holes from the sensor can tunnel in. These tunnelling events are detected by thresholding the phase of the reflectometry signal of the sensor to achieve single-shot readout of the spin state. Typical time traces of the reflected signal phase at stage M, representative of a spin up (spin down) in QD2, are shown in Extended Data Fig. 1d. We used this three-stage pulse sequence to optimize the readout. For that purpose, the tunnel rates between QD2 and the charge sensor were adjusted by fine tuning VG3 and VG4. For the spin-manipulation experiment discussed in the main text, we use a simplified two-stage sequence for readout by removing the empty stage. The measure stage duration is set to 200 \u03bcs for all experiments, while the load stage duration (seen as a manipulation stage duration) ranges from 50 \u03bcs to 1 ms. To obtain the spin-up probability P\u2191 after a given spin manipulation sequence, we repeat the single-shot readout a large number of times, typically 100\u20131,000 times.\nPulse sequences. For Ramsey, Hahn-echo, phase-gate and CPMG pulse sequences, we set a \u03c0/2 rotation time of 50 ns. Given the angular dependence of FRabi, we calibrate the microwave power required for this operation time for each magnetic field orientation. We also calibrate the amplitude of the \u03c0 pulses to achieve a \u03c0 rotation in 150 ns. In extracting the noise exponent \u03b3 from CPMG measurements, we do not include the time spent in the \u03c0 pulses (this time amounts to about 10% of the duration of each pulse sequence).\nNoise spectrum. We measured 3,700 Ramsey fringes over ttot = 10.26 h. For each realization, we varied the free evolution time \u03c4wait up to 7 \u03bcs, and averaged 200 single-shot spin measurements to obtain P\u2191 (Extended Data Fig. 6a, top). The fringes oscillate at the detuning \u0394f = \u2223fMW1 \u2212 fL\u2223 between the MW1 frequency fMW1 and the spin resonance frequency fL. To track low-frequency noise on fL, we make a Fourier transform of each fringe and extract its fundamental frequency \u0394f reported\nin Extended Data Fig. 6a (bottom). Throughout the experiment, fMW1 is set to 17 GHz. The low-frequency spectral noise on the Larmor frequency (in units of Hz2 Hz\u22121) is calculated (here we make use of two-sided power spectral densities, which are even with respect to the frequency) from \u0394f(t) as4:\nSL = ttot|FFT[\u0394f]|2\nN2 , (2)\nwhere FFT[\u0394f] is the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of \u0394f(t) and N is the number of sampling points. We observe that the low-frequency noise, plotted in Extended Data Fig. 6b, behaves approximately as SL(f) = Slf(f0/f) with Slf = 109 Hz2 Hz\u22121, which is comparable to what has been measured for a hole spin in natural germanium41. To further characterize the noise spectrum, we add the CPMG measurements as coloured dots in Extended Data Fig. 6b4:\nSL (N\u03c0 /(2\u03c4wait)) = \u2212 ln(ACPMG) 2\u03c02\u03c4wait , (3)\nwhere ACPMG is the normalized CPMG amplitude. As discussed in the main text, the resulting high-frequency noise scales as Shf(f0/f)0.5, where Shf = 8 \u00d7 104 Hz2 Hz\u22121 is four orders of magnitude lower than Slf. This high-frequency noise appears to be dominated by electrical fluctuations, as supported by the correlations between the Hahn-echo/CPMG T2 and the LSESs. Additional quasi-static contributions thus emerge at low frequency, and may include hyperfine interactions (Supplementary Information, section 5).\nModelling. The hole wave functions and g-factors are calculated with a six-band k \u22c5 p model26. The screening by the hole gases under gates G1, G3 and G4 is accounted for in the Thomas\u2013Fermi approximation. As discussed extensively in Supplementary Information, section 1, the best agreement with the experimental data is achieved by introducing a moderate amount of charge disorder. The theoretical data displayed in Figs. 1, 2 and Extended Data Fig. 3 correspond to a particular realization of this charge disorder (point-like positive charges with density \u03c3 = 5 \u00d7 1010 cm\u22122 at the Si/SiO2 interface and \u03c1 = 5 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22123 in bulk Si3N4). The resulting variability, and the robustness of the operation sweet spots with respect to disorder, are discussed in Supplementary Information, section 1. The rotation of the principal axes of the g-tensor visible in Fig. 1d,e are most probably due to small inhomogeneous strains (<0.1%); however, in the absence of quantitative strain measurements, we have simply shifted \u03b8zx by \u223c\u221225\u00b0 and \u03b8zy by \u223c10\u00b0 in the calculations of Figs. 1, 2 and Extended Data Fig. 3."

The g-factors gx, gy, and gz are plotted as as a function of the difference of potential \u2212 VG2 between gates G2 and gates G1 and G3 (both grounded). When increasing \u2212 VG2, the lateral electric field from the wrap gate squeezes the hole on the side facet of the channel [see panels (c) and (d)]. This strengthens heavy-hole/light-hole mixing, which results in a decrease of gx, and an increase of gy.

The symbols are the experimental data, and the dotted lines are calculated in the pristine device at the experimental bias point (with the hole gases below G1, G3 and G4). The lateral electric field is however too weak at this bias point to match the experimental anisotropy gy > gx. The solid lines are calculated in a particular realization of a disordered device with roughness and positive charge traps at the Si/SiO2 interface and in Si3N4 (see Methods and Supp. Info S1). These traps tend to strengthen confinement on the side facets (because they are much better screened near the corners of the wrap gate), which increases gy and decreases gx, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 2. Moreover, \u03b8zx is shifted by \u2248 \u2212 25\u2218 and \u03b8zy by \u2248 10\u2218 to account for the experimental rotations of the principal axes of the g-tensor (resulting from residual strains, see Supp. Info S1).

(c) Same as (b) for the echo quality factor QE = FRabi \u00d7 TE2. In the present case, the Rabi frequency is minimal around the sweet spot (a). Nonetheless, the quality factors Q* and QE do peak near the sweet spot owing to the much improved coherence times. They reach Q* = 23 and QE = 276, with peak-to-valley ratios of respectively \u2248 2.5 and \u2248 5.5. As discussed in section Supp. Info S2, we can achieve Rabi frequencies of at least 5 MHz at the sweet spot with a larger driving power PMW1 = 20 dBm, which results in Q* \u2248 35 and QE \u2248 440. In principle, the quality factors may be further improved by driving with gate G2 and looking for the sweet spot in the xy plane (see Supp. Info.

The main solenoid magnet produces a magnetic field of up to 6 T in the z direction, while both transverse Helmholtz coils ramp up to 1 T in the x and y directions. However, one of the axis was broken during the experiment. Therefore, after recording Fig. 1d of the main text, the sample was warmed up, physically rotated by 90\u2218, and cooled down again to record Fig. 1e. 24 twisted pairs are filtered at the mixing chamber by 6 low pass filters. The DC gate voltages are generated by Itest high stability voltage sources (BE2141). To perform charge and spin manipulation, semi-rigid coaxial lines with 20 GHz bandwidth are routed to G1, G2 and G3 using on-PCB bias tees. Microwave frequency signals are supplied by a vector signal generator (R&S SMW200A) with IQ modulating signals originating from two channels of an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) Tektronix AWG5200. Other channels of the AWG are used to generate the pulse sequences. The homodyne readout of the resonator connected to the drain electrode is performed with a Zurich Instrument UHFLI lock-in with an excitation power of \u2212 105 dBm at the PCB stage.
