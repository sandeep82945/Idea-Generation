1. **Extension to Non-Monocomponent Signals:** Investigate the possibility of extending the method to more general classes of signals, such as polycomponent signals or signals with time-varying amplitudes. This would significantly broaden the applicability of the method to a wider range of real-world scenarios.


2. **Robustness Analysis:** Conduct a thorough analysis of the robustness of the method to various factors, such as noise, outliers, and measurement errors. Determine the conditions under which the method is most effective and identify potential limitations.


3. **Computational Efficiency Improvements:** Explore techniques to improve the computational efficiency of the method, particularly for large datasets. This could involve optimizing the TDA algorithms used or developing more efficient embedding strategies.


4. **Application to Signal Separation:** Investigate the use of the method as a preprocessing step for signal separation algorithms. By accurately estimating the number of sources in a mixture, the method could help improve the performance of subsequent separation techniques.


5. **Exploration of Alternative Topological Invariants:** Examine the use of alternative topological invariants, beyond Betti numbers, to characterize the phase space of the mixture. This could potentially lead to more robust and informative features for source counting.
