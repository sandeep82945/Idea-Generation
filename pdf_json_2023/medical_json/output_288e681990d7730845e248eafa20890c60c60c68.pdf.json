    "abstractText": "In relaxed muscle, head-to-tail linked tropomyosin cables wrap around actin-based thin filaments and block the binding of myosin head domains. A small, Ca2+induced shift in the cable\u2019s position relieves this inhibition and allows the formation of myosin crossbridges, leading to muscle contraction. This positional shift is generally thought to involve tropomyosin either sliding or rolling across the surface of the actin filaments but, in this issue of JGP, Lehman and Rynkiewicz reveal that tropomyosin actually moves by pivoting around relatively fixed points on the actin subunits (1). Tropomyosin is a coiled\u2013coil protein containing seven pseudorepeat domains, each of which interacts with a neighboring actin subunit along the thin filament (2). In resting, low Ca2+ conditions, tropomyosin is thought to be held in an inhibitory \u201cB-state\u201d position by the C-terminal domain of the troponin-I subunit of the troponin complex. However, when Ca2+ binds to troponin-C, the C-terminal domain of troponin-I moves away, allowing tropomyosin to transition to a \u201cC-state\u201d position in which myosin heads can weakly bind to actin. (Myosin binding subsequently induces an additional shift in tropomyosin\u2019s position to an \u201cM-state,\u201d which facilitates further myosin binding and full thin filament activation). The movement of tropomyosin from the Bto C-states was first observed almost 30 yr ago (3), but the exact nature of this dynamic structural transition has remained unclear. The tropomyosin cable has been proposed to either roll or slide across the surface of actin, but a team led by William Lehman and Michael Rynkiewicz at Boston University Chobanian and Avedisian School of Medicine recently determined that the intermolecular salt bridges connecting tropomyosin and actin are largely the same in the Band C-states (4, 5). To understand more about the Bto C-state transition, Lehman and Rynkiewicz (1) generated atomic models of troponin and tropomyosin fitted to recent cryo-EM reconstructions of cardiac thin filaments under low and high Ca2+ conditions (6). When viewed face on, these models clearly showed the shift in tropomyosin\u2019s position between the low Ca2+ Band high Ca2+ C-states. Pseudorepeats 3\u20135, which interact with troponin-I in the B-state, showed the largest change in position during the transition to the C-state, while the head and tail domains of tropomyosin moved relatively little.
