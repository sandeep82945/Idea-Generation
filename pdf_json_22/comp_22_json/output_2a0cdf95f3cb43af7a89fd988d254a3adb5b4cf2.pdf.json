    "abstractText": "We study embeddings of continuous dynamical systems in larger dimensions via projector operators. We call this technique PEDS, projective embedding of dynamical systems, as the stable fixed point of the original system dynamics are recovered via projection from the higher dimensional space. In this paper we provide a general definition and prove that for a particular type of rank-1 projector operator, the uniform mean field projector, the equations of motion become a mean field approximation of the dynamical system. While in general the embedding depends on a specified variable ordering, the same is not true for the uniform mean field projector. In addition, we prove that the original stable and saddle-node fixed points retain this feature in the embedding dynamics, while unstable fixed points become saddles. Direct applications of PEDS can be non-convex optimization and machine learning.",

We call this technique PEDS, projective embedding of dynamical systems, as the stable fixed point of the original system dynamics are recovered via projection from the higher dimensional space. In this paper we provide a general definition and prove that for a particular type of rank-1 projector operator, the uniform mean field projector, the equations of motion become a mean field approximation of the dynamical system. While in general the embedding depends on a specified variable ordering, the same is not true for the uniform mean field projector. In addition, we prove that the original stable and saddle-node fixed points retain this feature in the embedding dynamics, while unstable fixed points become saddles. Direct applications of PEDS can be non-convex optimization and machine learning.\nKeywords: projective embedding, projector operators, dynamical systems, fixed points, PEDS"

            "text": "The past decades witnessed an increased interest in physics- or neuro-inspired algorithms for the analysis of dynamical systems, with the main area of application being problems that can be mapped onto optimization ones, whether continuous or discrete [2? , 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Among the most important neuro-inspired algorithms, we mention neural networks, which received a large amount of attention given their wide applicability and remarkable achievements: this is an active area of research falling at the boundary between complex systems, neuromorphic\nEmail address: caravelli@lanl.gov (F.

In the study of neural networks, one of the most important open problems is the acceleration of the training phase, a problem connected to the roughness of the energy landscape [16, 17]. Network training is one of the most difficult tasks, requiring in general huge computational power and a vast number of samples. Many algorithms attempt at modifying the energy function to reduce the time spent on saddle points [18, 19]. Changing the landscape is however challenging in general, as it somehow requires some a priori knowledge of what type of local extrema should be modified. Thus, finding valuable alternatives and/or generalizations of gradient descent has been a topic of intense study. In addition to this, analog models of computation is an active area of research [20] with several applications.\nFrom the point of view of a dynamical system, however, there are not many strategies that one can attempt to employ. A possibility, incidentally the one we explore in this paper, is to increase the dimensionality of the system, by attempting to preserve some properties related to the original dynamical system, while aiming at a trade-off between convergence optimality and the curse of dimensionality. The basic rationale for this strategy is that increasing dimensions, there are more pathways that a system can take in order to reach a certain target point. As a simple example, consider a one dimensional barrier between two minima in a potential: following gradients, one could never move from one local minimum to the other, while in a higher dimension system, pathways around that confinement barrier are, at least in principle, possible.\nThe technique we propose here is inspired by recent results in the context of memristive circuits [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. In circuits, Kirchhoff laws are manifestations of the conservation of physical quantities such as charge or energy. Mathematically, these can be expressed via the introduction of projection operators, i.e. matrices \ud835\udec0 satisfying the constraint \ud835\udec02 = \ud835\udec0, and directly connected to circuit topology. For instance, for a resistive circuit made of identical unitary resistances in series with impressed voltage generators, the Ohm\u2019s law for the network can be expressed as\n\u00ae\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udec0\u00ae\ud835\udc63, (1)\nwhere \u00ae\ud835\udc63 is the collection of voltage generators connected in series to each resistance, while \u00ae\ud835\udc56 contains the branch currents. The underlying assumption of (1) is that the voltage generators \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56\u2019s are in series to the resistances \ud835\udc56\u2019s, while the circuit can be represented as graph with \ud835\udc38 edges. Given the branch currents and a certain orientation of the graph loops 1, . . . , \ud835\udc3f, we can obtain the so called loop matrix of the circuit \ud835\udc34, of size \ud835\udc3f \u00d7 \ud835\udc38 , such that \ud835\udec0 = \ud835\udc68\ud835\udc61 (\ud835\udc68\ud835\udc68\ud835\udc61)\u22121\ud835\udc68, where \ud835\udc61 denotes the transpose. The details of the derivation of \ud835\udec0 from the circuit topology are beyond the scope of this paper, where \ud835\udec0 will be kept generic and unrelated to any underlying graph or conservation law.\nWe assume a continuous dynamical system, but the technique can in principle be extended to vector maps, and thus works also for numerical implementations of a dynamical system. Let us consider a dynamical system expressed in vector form as a first-order differential system\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56 (\u00ae\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc56 = 1, . . . , \ud835\udc5a (2)\nwhere functions \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56 (\u00b7) are assumed known, and analytic. We are in general interested in recovering the stable fixed points of (2), i.e. the values \u00ae\ud835\udc65\u2217 such that \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56 (\u00ae\ud835\udc65\u2217) = 0, if they exist.\nTo this aim we consider another dynamical system, of size \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc41, written in the form\n\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udec0 \u00ae\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc56 ( \u00ae\ud835\udc4b1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc5a) + \u00ae\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56 ( \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56) \ud835\udc56 = 1, . . . , \ud835\udc5a (3)\nwhere for each \ud835\udc56 value we define an augmented vector \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 of size \ud835\udc41. The question we aim at answering in this contribution is to ascertain whether functions \u00ae\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc56 and \u00ae\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56 exist such that the dynamical system (2) is contained, in a sense we will make more precise in the next section, into the extended system (3). The answer we provide in this paper is affirmative, as we will explicitly construct such system along with the technique to recover the original dynamical system.\nFrom a mathematical perspective, these generalizations can be investigated by the study of the properties of fixed points in the embedded system in terms of the original ones, which is the strategy we use in this paper. A fixed point \u00ae\ud835\udc65\u2217 is particular point of the phase space satisfying \ud835\udc51\u00ae\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 |\u00ae\ud835\udc65\u2217 = \ud835\udc53 (\u00ae\ud835\udc65\u2217) = 0. We dub the method developed in this\npaper Projective Embedding of Dynamical Systems (PEDS), as the technique involves the embedding of a target dynamical system of dimension \ud835\udc5a into one of dimension \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc41; ultimately, we recover the fixed points of the original dynamical system by projecting back onto a chosen set (of size \ud835\udc5a) of observables. We will prove that the information of the fixed points of the original target system are related to the fixed points of the reduced observables. As we will see, the dynamical system in which the embedding is contained is a nontrivial and nonlinear extension of the original dynamical system which is obtained via a map between the original one and an extended one. Although the projection operator may be quite general, we prove most of the results here for a specific operator, that we call uniform mean-field projector, as in this simplified case mostly analytical proofs are available.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the PEDS procedure formally, and provide various examples to intuitively grasp why these definitions make sense. In Section 3 we study the uniform mean field projector, and both for 1-dimensional and \ud835\udc5a-dimensional dynamical systems we prove exact results about the properties of the asymptotic stable fixed points and their Jacobians. In Section 4 we provide numerical examples alongside analytical analysis, to further corroborate the bulk of the paper. Finally, conclusions follow."

Let us now identify the key steps of the procedure. First, we begin with a dynamical system in the standard form.\nDefinition 2.2. Embedding procedure: PEDS. We explicitly define here the steps involved in developing the PEDS procedure.\n1. We begin with a tuple ({ \ud835\udc531(\u00ae\ud835\udc65), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5a (\u00ae\ud835\udc65)},\ud835\udec0, { \u00ae\ud835\udc3a1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u00ae\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5a},S, {\u00ae\ud835\udc4f1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u00ae\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5a}, \ud835\udc41), where \ud835\udec0 is a size \ud835\udc41 projector operator. We call { \ud835\udc531(\u00ae\ud835\udc65), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5a (\u00ae\ud835\udc65)} the target dynamical system, while \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 represent the target variables. S represents an ordering, relevant for the case of a multi-dimensional target system if the embedding is non-commutative. Vector \u00ae\ud835\udc4f is constant and such that \ud835\udec0\u00ae\ud835\udc4f \u2260 \u00ae0. Finally, \ud835\udc41 is the dimension of the embedding for each scalar variable. As such, it can also be interpreted as the number of dimensions in which each scalar variable is expanded into.\n2. Given the target dynamical system of dimension \ud835\udc5a, we build an extended dynamical system of size \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc41, represented by a set of canonical equations of the form\n\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udec0\ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc56 ( \u00ae\ud835\udc4b1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc5a) \u00ae\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56 + \u00ae\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udec0; \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56) \ud835\udc56 = 1, . . . , \ud835\udc5a (14)\nThis step is represented by the arrow O in Fig. 1, being it a mapping between each scalar functions \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56 to the vector function \u00ae\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc56 \u00ae\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56. Thus, for each dimension of the original dynamical system, we obtain an extended \ud835\udc41 dimensional subspace in the \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5a dynamical system, so that\n({ \ud835\udc531(\u00ae\ud835\udc65), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5a (\u00ae\ud835\udc65)}) \u2192 O\n({ \u00ae\ud835\udc391( \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u00ae\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc5a ( \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56)}, { \u00ae\ud835\udc3a1(\ud835\udec0; \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u00ae\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5a (\ud835\udec0; \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56)})\n\u2261 (\ud835\udc39, \ud835\udc3a) (15)\nWe call the specific map O the embedding, while (\ud835\udc39, \ud835\udc3a) is the extended system and \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 the extended variable (i.e., a set of \ud835\udc41 scalar variables in the extended system). We also dub the set \u00ae\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56, the decay functions. In each extended subspace, \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 is a vector of components \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57 , while diagonal matrix \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc56 is made of elements \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc58 = \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57\ud835\udeff \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc58 , where \ud835\udeff \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc58 represents Kronecker symbol. The original vector can be easily recovered from the diagonal matrix as \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc56\u00ae1. We stress that in principle \ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc56 can be a non-trivial function of \u03a9, as we shall discuss later on. 3. We consider the time evolution of both the original and the extended system, represented by maps \u03a6\u2032\ud835\udc61 and \u03a6\ud835\udc61 , respectively, in Fig. 1. In Example 2.1, the two maps were analytically expressed, thanks to the simplicity of the target system. 4. Arrow P in Fig. 1, finally, projects the extended dynamical system from size \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5a to an \ud835\udc5a dimensional system, that is required to coincide with the trajectory of the target dynamical system. For each variable, the projection is derived from the projector operator as, given a certain extended variable \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56, we obtain \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 = 1\ud835\udc41 \u2211\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc58=1\u03a9 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc58 ."

As we will see, such difference is important for embeddings of vector dynamical systems in the case of the mixed commutative map, but not for a scalar system. Notice also that\n\u2022 the standard commutative map is a linear mix of the dynamical systems functions \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56 (\u00ae\ud835\udc65), since a direct calculation shows\n\ud835\udc6d(\ud835\udc50) \ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc7f1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc5a) = diag ( \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc4b1,1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc5a,1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc4b1,\ud835\udc41 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc5a,\ud835\udc41 ) ) . (31)\nwhich simplifies drastically the evaluation\n\u2022 for scalar dynamical systems, the mixed commutative map and the standard non-commutative map reduce to the same quantity\n\u2022 in the case of vector dynamical systems, the mixed commutative map preserves the commutativity of the target variables, since diagonal matrices \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc8a commute among themselves.\nAs a consequence, for scalar dynamical system we will study only the standard commutative and non-commutative maps, while the result will follow also for the mixed commutative map from the non-commutative one.

We can write the embedded system as\n\ud835\udc51 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udec0 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b \u2212 \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec0) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b = \ud835\udec0(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udec0\ud835\udc7f)\u00ae1 \u2212 \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec0) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b (34)\nwhich is in the form of a PEDS (3), with \ud835\udc6d = \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udec0\ud835\udc7f, \u00ae\ud835\udc4f = \u00ae1 and \u00ae\ud835\udc3a = \u2212\ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec0) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b.\nWe would like to stress the fact that the PEDS mapping is, in general, highly nontrivial, at least as far as the projection operator is not the trivial one: this condition is required because in this case the matrix powers of the form (\ud835\udec0\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc56)\ud835\udc58 couple all the subspace variables in a nonlinear way.\nOn the other hand, for the trivial projector, the standard decay function is identically zero, and the extended system as well as any extended monomial are ordering independent. In fact, as the diagonal matrices \ud835\udc7f \ud835\udc57 commute among themselves, we have that\n{(\ud835\udec0\ud835\udc7f1) \ud835\udc571 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (\ud835\udec0\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc5a) \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc5a}\ud835\udc46 = (\ud835\udc7f1) \ud835\udc571 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc5a) \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc5a (35)\nif and only if \ud835\udec0 = \ud835\udc70. As a consequence, (27) becomes\n\ud835\udc51 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udec0\ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc56 ( \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc5a) \u00ae\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56 = \u00a9\u00ab \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56,1, . . . , \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5a)\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56,1 ... \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc41 , . . . , \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc5a)\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc41 \u00aa\u00ae\u00ae\u00ac \ud835\udc56 = 1, . . . , \ud835\udc5a (36) thus showing that the PEDS procedure for the trivial projector decouples into \ud835\udc41 identical copies of the original system."

Taking Fig. 1 as a reference, let our target system be described by the evolution map (the solution of the dynamical system) \ud835\udf19\u2032\ud835\udc61 : R \u2192 R, while the PEDS evolution is instead a map \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc61 : R \ud835\udc41 \u2192 R\ud835\udc41 .\nDefinition 3.1. A dynamical system \ud835\udc34 of size \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc34 is contained in a dynamical system \ud835\udc35 of dimensions \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc35 > \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc34 if a linear operator P : R\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc35 \u2192 R\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc34 exists such that, for \u00ae\ud835\udc4b \u2208 R\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc35 P\ud835\udf19\ud835\udc61 ( \u00ae\ud835\udc4b) = \ud835\udf19\u2032\ud835\udc61 (\u00ae\ud835\udc65), (41) where \u00ae\ud835\udc65 has size \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc34.\nGiven the definition above, we can now prove the following\nProposition 3.2. Banality of mean value. Let O = ( \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65),\ud835\udec0, 0, \u00ae1, \ud835\udc41) be a PEDS tuple of a target dynamical system as in (37), where the matrix map can take either the standard commuting or standard non-commuting forms.

Let us consider an extended variable \u00ae\ud835\udc4b subject to the condition \u00ae\ud835\udc4b = \ud835\udc65\u00ae1. Then, as \ud835\udc7f = \ud835\udc65\u00ae1 and \ud835\udec0\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udec0 \ud835\udc56 > 0, for both the standard commuting and non-commuting maps we have:\n\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b = \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \u00ae1 =  \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=0 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udec0\u00ae1 commuting map \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=0 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udec0\u00ae1 non commuting map = \ud835\udc4e0\ud835\udec0\u00ae1 + \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udec0\u00ae1 = \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udec0\u00ae1 (42)\nTherefore, projecting the previous relation onto the span of \ud835\udec0, i.e. evaluating \ud835\udec0 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b =\n\ud835\udec0 \u00ae\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc7f), we obtain ( \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \u2212 \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65)\n) \ud835\udec0\u00ae1 = 0. (43)\nIt follows that as \ud835\udec0\u00ae1 \u2260 \u00ae0, then \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \u2212 \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65) = 0.

It shows that if the initial condition for the variables \u00ae\ud835\udc4b are chosen homogeneously, then the extended dynamical system will follow the one dimensional dynamics of (37). However, condition \u00ae\ud835\udc4b = \ud835\udc65\u00ae1 is a strong requirement for the dynamical system. In principle, a dynamically obtained convergence towards a state of the form \u00ae\ud835\udc4b = \ud835\udc65\u00ae1 would be a much better demand. To this aim, we introduce the decay functions."

On the other hand, projecting via (\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec01), we obtain for both generalizations the following governing equation for the non-uniform modes\n\ud835\udc51 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \u2212(\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec01)\ud835\udc6b \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (51)\nwhose solution is\n\u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc52\u2212(\ud835\udc70\u2212\ud835\udec0)\ud835\udc6b\ud835\udc61 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (0) \ud835\udec0=\ud835\udec01 . (52)\nWe show now that the two generalizations A and B are \ud835\udec0-eligible, i.e. that \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 asymptotically approaches the zero vector. We prove the following proposition for general projectors:\nProposition 3.4. Given the governing equation (51) written for a general projector \ud835\udec0, assuming \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (0) \u2208 Span(\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec0) then \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc61) \u2208 Span(\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec0) \u2200\ud835\udc61. Proof. The solution of (51) takes the form\n\u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc68\ud835\udc61 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (0) (53)\nwhere \ud835\udc68 = (\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec0)\ud835\udc6b. Expanding the exponential, we get \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc61) = \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (0) + +\u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc58=1 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58!

(54)\nWe notice that if \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (0) \u2208 Span(\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec0), then we can express \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (0) = \u2211 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc57 \u00ae\ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 where \u00ae\ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57\nare eigenvectors associated to the eigenvalue equal to 1 of \ud835\udc70\u2212\ud835\udec0. Thus, (\ud835\udc70\u2212\ud835\udec0) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (0) =\u2211 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec0)\u00ae\ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 = \u2211 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc57 \u00ae\ud835\udc63 \ud835\udc57 = \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (0). This implies that\n(\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec0) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc61) = \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (0) + +\u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc58=1 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58!

Equation (51) implies that, if \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (0) \u2208 Span(\ud835\udc70\u2212\ud835\udec01), then in (50) one has \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc61\u2192\u221e \u00ae\ud835\udc4b (\ud835\udc61) = \u3008\ud835\udc4b\u3009\u00ae1.\nProof. We consider the dynamics for the modes \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 = (\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec01) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b (\ud835\udc61) from (51), and we use a Lyapunov stability argument. Let us consider the following functional: \ud835\udc49 ( \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50) = \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 \u00b7 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 \u2265 0. Then,\n\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc49 = 2\n( \ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc61)\n) \u00b7 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc61)\n= \u22122((\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec01)\ud835\udc6b \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc61)) \u00b7 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc61) = \u22122( \u221a \ud835\udc6b \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc61)) \u00b7 \u221a \ud835\udc6b (\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec01)\ud835\udc47 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc61) = \u22122( \u221a \ud835\udc6b \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc61)) \u00b7 \u221a \ud835\udc6b (\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec01) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc61). (56)\nUsing the fact that \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc61) \u2208 Span(\ud835\udc70 \u2212 \ud835\udec01) from the previous Proposition, we obtain that\n\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc49 = \u22122| |\n\u221a \ud835\udc6b \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc61) | |2 \u2264 0. (57)\nSince the only minimum of \ud835\udc49 ( \u00ae\ud835\udc4b) is \u00ae\ud835\udc4b = \u00ae0, then \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc61) \u2192 \u00ae0 for \ud835\udc61 \u2192 \u221e. This proves that \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc50 (0) \u2192 \u00ae0, and thus \u00ae\ud835\udc4b \u2192 \u3008\ud835\udc4b\u3009\u00ae1, for \ud835\udc61 \u2192 \u221e.\nPropositions 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, along with Corollary 3.5 imply that for a onedimensional dynamical system, the PEDS O = ( \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65),\ud835\udec01,\u2212(\ud835\udc70 \u2212 \ud835\udec01) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b, \u00ae1, \ud835\udc41) contains the fixed points of the original dynamical system. In particular, Corollary 3.5 implies that the extended system converges to an asymptotic state of the form \u00ae\ud835\udc4b (\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc61)\u00ae1. Therefore, through the banality of the mean value Lemma, the PEDS embedding will contain the original dynamical system.\nFor practical purposes, it is sufficient to consider the observable \ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc61) = \u3008\ud835\udc4b\u3009 = 1 \ud835\udc41 \u2211\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57=1\u03a91,\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc4b \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) in order to recover the location of the fixed points. Clearly, this example applies only to a one-dimensional dynamical system. However, the result can be extended to the vector case following similar considerations.\nExample 3.6.\nAs an example of a one dimensional dynamical system embedded in \ud835\udc41 = 2 dimensions, let us consider the dynamical system\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc65 \u2212 \ud835\udc652 (58)\nwhose stable fixed point is given by \ud835\udc65\u2217 = 1. A PEDS embedding O = (\ud835\udc65\u2212\ud835\udc652,\ud835\udec01,\u2212\ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc70\u2212 \ud835\udec01) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b, \u00ae1, 2) is given by the two coupled differential equations:\n\ud835\udc51 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61\n= \ud835\udec01 ( \ud835\udc7f \u2212 \ud835\udc7f2 ) \u00ae1 \u2212 \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec01) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b (59)\nwhose components can be made explicit introducing \u3008\ud835\udc4b\u3009 = 12 (\ud835\udc4b1 + \ud835\udc4b2) and evaluating the matrix expressions. The result is\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc4b1\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \u3008\ud835\udc4b\u3009 \u2212 \u3008\ud835\udc4b\u30092 \u2212 \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc4b1 \u2212 \u3008\ud835\udc4b\u3009) (60)\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc4b2\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \u3008\ud835\udc4b\u3009 \u2212 \u3008\ud835\udc4b\u30092 \u2212 \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc4b2 \u2212 \u3008\ud835\udc4b\u3009) (61)\nwhose stable fixed point is easily seen to be \ud835\udc4b\u22171 = \ud835\udc4b \u2217 2 = 1.\nExample 3.6 highlights an important property of the uniform mean field embedding. We gain some intuition on how the uniform mean field projector works by exploiting a direct evaluation of the matrix powers. For instance, for the PEDS O = ( \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65),\ud835\udec01,\u2212\ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec01) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b, \u00ae1, \ud835\udc41), then\n\ud835\udc51 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udec01 \u00ae\ud835\udc39 ( \u00ae\ud835\udc4b) \u2212 \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec01) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b. (62)\nUsing the properties\n(\ud835\udec01\ud835\udc7f)\ud835\udc58 = \u3008\ud835\udc4b\u3009\ud835\udc58\u22121\ud835\udec01\ud835\udc7f \ud835\udc58 \u2265 1, \ud835\udec01\ud835\udc7f\u00ae1 = \ud835\udec01 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b = \u3008\ud835\udc4b\u3009\u00ae1, \ud835\udec01\u00ae1 = \u00ae1\nwe obtain the equivalent form for (62)\n\ud835\udc51 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc53 (\u3008\ud835\udc65\u3009)\u00ae1 \u2212 \ud835\udefc( \u00ae\ud835\udc4b \u2212 \u3008\ud835\udc65\u3009\u00ae1). (63)\nMultiplying on the left times \ud835\udec01 and times \ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec01, yields\n\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61\n( \u3008\ud835\udc4b\u3009\u00ae1 ) = \ud835\udc53 (\u3008\ud835\udc4b\u3009)\u00ae1, (64)\n\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61\n( \u00ae\ud835\udc4b \u2212 \u3008\ud835\udc4b\u3009\u00ae1 ) = \u2212\ud835\udefc( \u00ae\ud835\udc4b \u2212 \u3008\ud835\udc4b\u3009\u00ae1). (65)\nTherefore, the mean value \u3008\ud835\udc4b\u3009 in (64) follows exactly the target system dynamics, while (65) asymptotically determines \u00ae\ud835\udc4b \u2192 \u3008\ud835\udc4b\u3009\u00ae1 for \ud835\udc61 1/\ud835\udefc. It follows that for scalar target systems, because of the identity (\ud835\udec01\ud835\udc7f)\ud835\udc58 = \u3008\ud835\udc4b\u3009\ud835\udc58\u22121\ud835\udec01\ud835\udc7f, the standard commutative and non-commutative maps are identical. This is no longer true for vector target systems, as we discuss below."

            "text": "We will now focus on the generalization of the previous results to the case of a vector target dynamical system of arbitrary dimension. Such generalization is involved, basically because the ordering \ud835\udc46 becomes important (at least for the standard noncommutative map) and this depends on the fact that matrix terms such as (\ud835\udec0\ud835\udc7f)\ud835\udc56 and (\ud835\udec0\ud835\udc7f) \ud835\udc57 do not commute. Nevertheless, exploiting the properties of the uniform mean field projector \ud835\udec01 certain exact results can be obtained.\nWe consider an \ud835\udc5a dimensional target system as in (2), where a Taylor expansion of the defining functions \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc651, . . . , \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a) takes the form (25) after choosing the ordering\n\ud835\udc46. Following the PEDS procedure, we construct as a first instance the embedding map O = ({ \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56},\ud835\udec01, 0, \ud835\udc46, \u00ae1, \ud835\udc41) in the abscence of decay functions.

Multivariate banality of the mean value.

Following the PEDS procedure, the dynamics of the \ud835\udc5a variables \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 is determined by\n\ud835\udc51 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udec01 \u00ae\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc56 ( \u00ae\ud835\udc4b1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc5a) \u2212 \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec01) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 (67)\nwhere \u00ae\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc56 ( \u00ae\ud835\udc4b1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc5a)\u00ae1 is the vector constructed following the PEDS procedure defined in (66). We define the projection operator P\ud835\udec01 = 1\ud835\udc41 \u00ae1 \ud835\udc47 , and the projected variables \u3008\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61)\u3009 = P\ud835\udec01 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61). Then, the following two statements hold true\n(\ud835\udc4e) \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \u3008\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56\u3009 = 0 =\u21d2 \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 = 0, (68)\nand (b) if the extended system approaches a fixed point \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\u2217 \ud835\udc56 for times \ud835\udc61 1/\ud835\udefc, then the projection P\ud835\udec01 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\u2217\ud835\udc56 is a fixed point of the target system.\nProof. Let us first prove statement (\ud835\udc4e), which is a corollary of the banality of the mean value Proposition 3.2. We set \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) = \u3008\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61)\u3009\u00ae1. In all cases of the standard commutative, mixed commutative and non-commutative maps, the standard decay function is identically zero, and it is not hard to see that, for an arbitrary orderings\n\ud835\udc46, we have in all cases the same expression for each term of the expansion:\n\ud835\udec01(\ud835\udc7f1)\ud835\udc561 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc5a)\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\u00ae1( \ud835\udec01(\ud835\udc7f1) \ud835\udc561\u2211 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc58 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc5a) \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\u2211 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc58 )\u2211 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc58 \u00ae1\n{(\ud835\udec01\ud835\udc7f1)\ud835\udc561 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (\ud835\udec01\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc5a)\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a}\ud835\udc46\u00ae1\n = \u3008\ud835\udc4b1(\ud835\udc61)\u3009\ud835\udc561 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u3008\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc5a (\ud835\udc61)\u3009\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udec01\u00ae1\n= \u3008\ud835\udc4b1(\ud835\udc61)\u3009\ud835\udc561 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u3008\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc5a (\ud835\udc61)\u3009\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\u00ae1 (69)\nAs a consequence, a relatively simple calculation shows\n\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \u3008\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61)\u3009\u00ae1 = \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56 (\u3008\ud835\udc4b1(\ud835\udc61)\u3009, . . . , \u3008\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc5a (\ud835\udc61)\u3009)\ud835\udec01\u00ae1 = \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56 (\u3008\ud835\udc4b1(\ud835\udc61)\u3009, . . . , \u3008\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc5a (\ud835\udc61)\u3009)\u00ae1, (70)\nor ( \ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \u3008\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61)\u3009 \u2212 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56 (\u3008\ud835\udc4b1(\ud835\udc61)\u3009, . . . , \u3008\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc5a (\ud835\udc61)\u3009)\n) \u00ae1 = 0. (71)\nReplacing \u3008\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61)\u3009 with \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61), we obtain that the fixed points of the extended system under the assumption \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) = \u3008\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61)\u3009\u00ae1 must be the same as for the target dynamical system.\nWe now turn to statement (\ud835\udc4f). The initial condition \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61 = 0) is now arbitrary. Multiplying on the left (67) times (\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec01), we get\n(\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec01) \ud835\udc51 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \u2212\ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec01) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 (72)\nwhere we define \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc50 = (\ud835\udc70\u2212\ud835\udec01) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56. As Span(\ud835\udc70\u2212\ud835\udec01) = Ker(\ud835\udec01), \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc50 can be interpreted as a deviation from the average, since \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 = \u3008\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56\u3009\u00ae1 + \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc50. Following almost the same steps as in the proof of the convergence of the mean for the one dimensional system, we arrive at\n\ud835\udc51 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \u2212\ud835\udefc \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc50 =\u21d2\n(\u3008\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61)\u3009 \u2212 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56 (\u3008\ud835\udc4b1(\ud835\udc61)\u3009, . . . , \u3008\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc5a (\ud835\udc61)\u3009)) \u00ae1 = ( P\ud835\udec01 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) \u2212 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56 (P\ud835\udec01 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b1(\ud835\udc61), . . . ,P\ud835\udec01 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc5a (\ud835\udc61)) ) \u00ae1 \u2192 \u00ae0, for \ud835\udc61 1\n\ud835\udefc . (73)\nwhere the second expression follows from the first being \ud835\udefc > 0, so that \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc61) \u2192 \u00ae0 for \ud835\udc61 1/\ud835\udefc. Essentially, this implies that the extended system fixed points are those of the target dynamical system: for long enough times the system converges exponentially to the mean in each variable, for which the banality lemma applies. Thus, if the projected PEDS given by O approaches a fixed point, it has to be a fixed point of the target system. Alternatively, the system must not converge.\nThe results of this section show that at least one type of PEDS exists which preserves the fixed points of the target system, thus justifying the entire construction of the PEDS embedding. We now focus the attention on how the PEDS procedure modifies the properties of the fixed points, by analyzing their stability. Therefore, we need to look at the spectral properties of the Jacobian at the embedding fixed points."

Consider the uniform mean field PEDS with standard decay function O = ( \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65),\ud835\udec01,\u2212\ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc70\u2212\ud835\udec01) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b, \u00ae1, \ud835\udc41) of a scalar dynamical system characterized by a fixed point \ud835\udc65\u2217.

We exploit Proposition 3.8, considering \ud835\udec0 = \ud835\udec01 and \u00ae\ud835\udc4f = \u00ae1, from which, because of Proposition 3.2, we have \ud835\udc7f\u2217 = \ud835\udc65\u2217\ud835\udc70.

Summing the second term (85), finally yields for both maps\n\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5f ( \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\u2217) = \ud835\udc53 \u2032(\ud835\udc65\u2217)\u03a91,\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5f \u2212 \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec01)\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5f = \u2212\ud835\udefc\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5f + ( \ud835\udc53 \u2032(\ud835\udc65\u2217) + \ud835\udefc)\u03a91,\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5f = \u2212\ud835\udefc\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5f + 1\n\ud835\udc41 ( \ud835\udc53 \u2032(\ud835\udc65\u2217) + \ud835\udefc). (89)\nAt this point we can start to draw some partial conclusions. In fact, we can use the properties of the fixed points of the target system to understand how these are transformed by the embedding procedure. The target system equilibrium is unstable if \ud835\udc53 \u2032(\ud835\udc65\u2217) > 0, while it is stable for \ud835\udc53 \u2032(\ud835\udc65\u2217) < 0. Finally, \ud835\udc53 \u2032(\ud835\udc65\u2217) = 0 corresponds to a saddle. Since any scalar dynamical system is conservative, it can be expressed as\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65) = \u2212\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc49 (\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udf15\ud835\udc65 , (90)\nwhere \ud835\udc49 is a potential function. The extrema \ud835\udc65\u2217 of \ud835\udc49 (\ud835\udc65) correspond to minima, maxima and saddles, as we show in Fig. 2.\nFor the PEDS O = ( \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65),\ud835\udec01,\u2212\ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc70 \u2212 \ud835\udec01) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b, \u00ae1, \ud835\udc41), Corollary 3.9 implies that the Jacobian spectrum follows from the spectral properties of \ud835\udec01. In fact, \ud835\udec01 has one eigenvalue equal to 1, and \ud835\udc41 \u2212 1 identical, null eigenvalues. Thus, the spectrum \u039b of the Jacobian at \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\u2217 = \ud835\udc65\u2217\u00ae1 is given by\n\u039b(\ud835\udc71(\ud835\udc65\u2217)) = {{\u2212\ud835\udefc}\ud835\udc41\u22121, { \ud835\udc53 \u2032(\ud835\udc65\u2217)}1}, (91)\ni.e. \u2212\ud835\udefc with multiplicity \ud835\udc41 \u2212 1, and \ud835\udc53 \u2032(\ud835\udc65\u2217) with multiplicity 1. We can therefore carry out a stability analysis of the PEDS fixed point \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\u2217 as follows:\n\u00ae\ud835\udc4b\u2217 is  stable if \ud835\udc65\u2217 is stable, a saddle point if \ud835\udc65\u2217 is a saddle point, a saddle point if \ud835\udc65\u2217 is unstable.\n(92)\nWe thus see what are the benefits of the PEDS from the point of view of the target system. While in the scalar case \u201cbarriers\u201d can be present, these can be made to disappear via the PEDS. Although this specific feature is peculiar to scalar target systems, this result will later be useful also for vector target systems. A graphical representation is shown in Fig. 3.\nWe can conclude that the PEDS procedure O = ( \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65),\ud835\udec01,\u2212\ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc70 \u2212 \ud835\udec01) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b, \u00ae1, \ud835\udc41) preserves stable and saddle fixed points of the target dynamics, while it turns unstable fixed points into saddle points.\nLet us now consider the Jacobian properties in presence of the generalized decay functions in (75). A simple generalization of (85) yields\n\ud835\udc3d (2) \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5f ( \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\u2217) =  \u2212 ( \ud835\udc6b (\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec0) ) \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5f\ngeneralization A \u2212 ( (\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec0)\ud835\udc6b (\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec0) ) \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5f generalization B. (93)\nTherefore, the full Jacobian for \ud835\udec0 = \ud835\udec01 and \u00ae\ud835\udc4f = \u00ae1, becomes \ud835\udc71( \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\u2217) = \ud835\udc53 \u2032(\ud835\udc65\u2217)\ud835\udec01 \u2212 { \ud835\udc6b (\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec01) generalization A\n(\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec01)\ud835\udc6b (\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec01) generalization B. (94)\nWe wish, now, to determine the spectrum \u039b(\ud835\udc71( \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\u2217)). We consider the two generalizations separately:\n\u2022 Generalization B. As a consequence of the identities \ud835\udec0(\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec0) = (\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec0)\ud835\udec0 = 0, we can deduce [\ud835\udc71 (1) , \ud835\udc71 (2)] = 0 \u2200\ud835\udc6b. Thus, both Jacobian components can be diagonalized in the same basis assembled in matrix \ud835\udc7b, such that \ud835\udc7b\ud835\udec0\ud835\udc7b\u22121 = \ud835\udc6b1 and \ud835\udc7b (\ud835\udc70\u2212\ud835\udec0)\ud835\udc6b (\ud835\udc70\u2212\ud835\udec0)\ud835\udc7b\u22121 = \ud835\udc6b2. Then the eigenvalues are given by the elements of the diagonal matrix \ud835\udc6b1 + \ud835\udc6b2. Since it is not hard to see that Span(\ud835\udec0) = Ker((\ud835\udc70\u2212\ud835\udec0)\ud835\udc6b (\ud835\udc70\u2212\ud835\udec0)) and Span(\ud835\udec0)\u222aSpan((\ud835\udc70\u2212\ud835\udec0)\ud835\udc6b (\ud835\udc70\u2212\ud835\udec0)) = R\ud835\udc41 with Span(\ud835\udec0)\u2229 Span((\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec0)\ud835\udc6b (\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec0)) = \u2205, we can focus on the eigenvalues of the two addends of \ud835\udc71. For \ud835\udc71 (1), there are \ud835\udc40 eigenvalues equal to 0 and \ud835\udc41\u2212\ud835\udc40 identical eigenvalues \ud835\udf06 = \ud835\udc53 \u2032(\ud835\udc65\u2217). For \ud835\udc71 (2\ud835\udc35) = (\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec0)\ud835\udc6b (\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec0), there are \ud835\udc41 \u2212\ud835\udc40 null eigenvalues, while the remaining \ud835\udc40 eigenvalues satisfy 0 < \ud835\udf06 \u2264 max{\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56}. Clearly, \ud835\udc40 is determined by the cardinality of Span(\ud835\udec0), equal to 1 for \ud835\udec01.\n\u2022 Generalization A. This case is slightly more complicated, since the Jacobian is not symmetric and, thus, its eigenvalues can be complex. We can provide some results exploiting Gerschgorin\u2019s theorem\n|\ud835\udf06 \u2212 \ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 | \u2264 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc58\u2260\ud835\udc56 |\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc56 |. (95)\nSince \ud835\udec0 = \ud835\udec01 and \u00ae\ud835\udc4f = \u00ae1, we have\n\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 = 1 \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 \u2032(\ud835\udc65\u2217) \u2212 \ud835\udc41 \u2212 1 \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\n\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc58\u2260\ud835\udc56 |\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc56 | = \ud835\udc41 \u2212 1 \ud835\udc41 | \ud835\udc53 \u2032(\ud835\udc65\u2217) + \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 | = \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc56\nLet ?\u0304? = max\ud835\udc56 |\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 | and \ud835\udc45 = \ud835\udc41\u22121\ud835\udc41 | \ud835\udc53 \u2032(\ud835\udc65\u2217) |. It follows that the eigenvalues \ud835\udf06 \u2208 \u039b(\ud835\udc71) must be enclosed, in the complex plane, in circles of radius \ud835\udc45 and center \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc56 = 1 \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 \u2032(\ud835\udc65\u2217) \u2212 \ud835\udc41\u22121 \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56."

            "text": "The analysis of the PEDS embedding for scalar target systems carried out in the previous section showed that exploiting the uniform mean field projector and the standard or generalized decay functions, the embedding Jacobian can be fully characterized on the basis of the features of the target system fixed points (stable, unstable, or neutral). We have obtained this result both for the standard commutative map, in which essentially one \u201cmixes\u201d linearly the dynamical systems, and in the case of the standard non-commuting map, in which the mix is non-trivial. The difference between the two is, thus, essentially contained in the embedding intermediate dynamics.\nWhile in higher dimensions the nature of the questions to be answered is quite similar, the derivations are technically more challenging. The reason lies in the ordering,\nthat, as mentioned earlier, does play a role in how the PEDS is defined. However, the case\ud835\udec0 = \ud835\udec01 still makes it possible to carry out an almost entirely analytical derivation, even if at least some results can be proved for a more general projector structure.\nLet us focus on the following PEDS for an \ud835\udc5a-dimensional target system\nO = {{ \ud835\udc531(\u00ae\ud835\udc65), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5a (\u00ae\ud835\udc65)},\ud835\udec01,\u2212{\ud835\udc781(\ud835\udec01) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\ud835\udc78\ud835\udc5a (\ud835\udec01) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b}, \u00ae1, \ud835\udc41}.\nTherefore we consider an extended system as in (14) characterized by the mean field projector and any eligible decay functions.\nSimilarly to the scalar case, we also consider here the two generalizations \ud835\udc78 to the standard decay functions defined in (49). The corresponding PEDS take the form O\ud835\udc34 = ({ \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc65)},\ud835\udec01, {\u2212\ud835\udc6b (\ud835\udc70 \u2212 \ud835\udec01) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56}, \ud835\udc46, \u00ae1, \ud835\udc41) and O\ud835\udc35 = ({ \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc65)},\ud835\udec01, {\u2212(\ud835\udc70 \u2212 \ud835\udec01)\ud835\udc6b (\ud835\udc70 \u2212 \ud835\udec01) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56}, \ud835\udc46, \u00ae1, \ud835\udc41), which in terms of PEDS equations, read\n\ud835\udc51 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udec01\ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc56 ( \u00ae\ud835\udc4b1, . . . , \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc5a)\u00ae1 \u2212 \ud835\udc78\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udec01) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56 (96)\nwhere\n\ud835\udc78\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udec01) = { \ud835\udc6b\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec01) generalization A\n(\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec01)\ud835\udc6b\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec01) generalization B (97)\nbeing \ud835\udc6b\ud835\udc56 positive, diagonal matrices that make the corresponding decay function \ud835\udec01- eligible.\nFor any eligible decay function, we can obtain the vector target system Jacobian for the PEDS system as follows.

(112)\nFinally, let us turn to the non-commutative map Jacobian, for which we have the following result.\nProposition 3.11. Let O = ({ \ud835\udc531(\u00ae\ud835\udc65), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5a (\u00ae\ud835\udc65)},\ud835\udec01, {\ud835\udc78\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udec01) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc56}, \ud835\udc46, \u00ae1, \ud835\udc41) be the PEDS built on a non-commutative map, considering the decay functions \ud835\udc78\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udec01) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b assumed to be \ud835\udec01-eligible. Then, for any ordering \ud835\udc46, the Jacobian matrix, evaluated at the equilibrium \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\u2217\n\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc65\u2217 \ud835\udc56 \u00ae1, is given by\n\ud835\udc71 (\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50) \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 ({ \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\u2217\ud835\udc56 }) = \ud835\udec01 \ud835\udc53 \u2032\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc57 (\u00ae\ud835\udc65 \u2217) + \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc78\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udec01). (113)\nProof. As we aim at demonstrating the independence of the Jacobian from the ordering \ud835\udc46 (at the fixed points), we consider the formalism introduced in Section 2.1. Given the matrix map definition (26), we use the general form\n\ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc60 ( \u00ae\ud835\udc4b) = \u221e\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc58=0 \ud835\udc57\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc561,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57=0 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60,\ud835\udc58;\ud835\udc561,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a{(\ud835\udec0\ud835\udc7f1)\ud835\udc561 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (\ud835\udec0\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc5a)\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a}\ud835\udc46 (114)\nthat forms the basis for the evaluation of the first Jacobian component.

We are interested in assessing the properties of its eigenvalues.\nFor the time being, we discuss the simpler case \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56 \u2261 \ud835\udefc, and since it will be useful later, let us think of this Jacobian for a general \ud835\udec0, only to then consider \ud835\udec01 as a special case.3 Let us therefore discuss the spectrum of\n\ud835\udc71({ \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\u2217\ud835\udc56 }) = (\ud835\udc71\ud835\udc5a (\u00ae\ud835\udc65\u2217) + \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc70\ud835\udc5a) \u2297 \ud835\udec0 \u2212 \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc70\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5a . (122)\nwhere \ud835\udc70\ud835\udc5e is the identity matrix of size \ud835\udc5e \u00d7 \ud835\udc5e. Being \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc56 the eigenvalues of \ud835\udc71\ud835\udc5a (\u00ae\ud835\udc65\u2217), the eigenvalues of \ud835\udc71\ud835\udc5a (\u00ae\ud835\udc65\u2217) + \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc70\ud835\udc5a are given by \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefc, and \u2212\ud835\udefc are the eigenvalues of \u2212\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc70\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5a for the whole matrix. Let us assume that \ud835\udec0 has \ud835\udc58 unitary eigenvalues (\ud835\udc58 = 1 for \ud835\udec0 = \ud835\udec01), while the remaining \ud835\udc41 \u2212 \ud835\udc58 eigenvalues are equal to 0. Then matrix \ud835\udc71({ \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\u2217\ud835\udc56 }) has eigenvalues [27]\n\u2022 \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc56, 1 \u2264 \ud835\udc56 \u2264 \ud835\udc5a with multiplicity \ud835\udc58\n\u2022 \u2212\ud835\udefc with multiplicity \ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc41 \u2212 \ud835\udc58).\nAs a consequence, if \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc56 < 0 \u2200\ud835\udc56, then a stable equilibrium point for the target system is still stable in the PEDS embedding. Similarly, if the equilibrium point is unstable, or if at least some \ud835\udc56 values exist for which \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc56 > 0, then it becomes a saddle point for the extended system, being characterized by \ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc41 \u2212 \ud835\udc58) negative eigenvalues and \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc58 positive eigenvalues. Thus, the following classification holds\n{ \u00ae\ud835\udc4b\u2217\ud835\udc56 } =  stable if \u00ae\ud835\udc65\u2217 is stable, saddle point if \u00ae\ud835\udc65\u2217 is a saddle point, saddle point if \u00ae\ud835\udc65\u2217 is unstable.\n(123)\nThis analysis suggests that the presence of \u201cbarriers\u201d in the target system, characterized by unstable equilibria, can (in principle) be overcome in the PEDS embedding via their transformation into saddle points in the extended system.\n2According to the definition, the \ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57 block of the matrix Kronecker product \ud835\udc34 \u2297 \ud835\udc35 is \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc35. 3To motivate this generalized discussion, we briefly anticipate the result of an upcoming paper, in which we show that (122) is in fact the first term of the representation obtained for the Jacobian of a general projector \ud835\udec0. This general case is, however, beyond the scope of this paper."

            "text": "For the sake of implementation, it would be convenient to define the PEDS transformation without having to evaluate the Taylor expansion, as for the theoretical developments in the previous Sections. This can be easily carried out for factorized vector target systems \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc651, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a) = \u220f\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc58=1 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc58 (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc58 ) (or linear combinations of factorized terms of the same type). For such factorized target systems, the matrix map can be built as the function \ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc58 (\ud835\udec0\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 ) (and \ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc7f1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc5a) = \u2211 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56 \u220f\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc58=1 \ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc58 (\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 ) or similar expressions). The question is therefore how to efficiently evaluate such matrix functions. This can be done defining the matrix maps as the Taylor expansion evaluated in matrix \ud835\udec0\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 . We can write\n(\ud835\udec0\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 )\ud835\udc60 = \u221a\ufe01 \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 \u22121 (\u221a\ufe01 \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58\ud835\udec0 \u221a\ufe01 \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 ) \ud835\udc60\u221a\ufe01 \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 (131)\nwhere \u221a \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 always exists since \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 is diagonal. Notice that (131) defines a similarity transformation, i.e. it conserves the spectrum of the similar matrices. An important\npoint is to verify that if the spectrum of \ud835\udec0\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 is real and \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 is diagonal, then the spectrum of \u221a \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58\ud835\udec0 \u221a \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 is also real. This can be shown using the fact that, based on the definition of the Cayley polynomial and on the determinant properties, the eigenvalue problem for \ud835\udec0\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 is equivalent to the generalized eigenvalue problem \ud835\udec0\u00ae\ud835\udc63 \u2212 \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc7f\u22121\ud835\udc58 \u00ae\ud835\udc63 = \u00ae0, assuming \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 invertible. Then, a proof similar to the spectral theorem shows that if \ud835\udec0 and \ud835\udc7f\u22121\n\ud835\udc58 are symmetric and real, then Im(\ud835\udf06) = 0. This guarantees that an extension\nto the complex field of the scalar target system functions \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc58 (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc58 ) is not required. In fact, (131) implies\n\ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc58 (\ud835\udec0\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 ) = \u221a\ufe01 \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 \u22121 \ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc58 ( \u221a\ufe01 \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58\ud835\udec0 \u221a\ufe01 \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 ) \u221a\ufe01 \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 . (132)\nSince \u221a \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58\ud835\udec0 \u221a \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 is symmetric, \ud835\udc77\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc58 exists such that\u221a\ufe01\n\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58\ud835\udec0 \u221a\ufe01 \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 = \ud835\udc77\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc58\ud835\udeba\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc77 \u22121 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc58\nwhere the real matrix \ud835\udeba\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc58 = diag{\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc58 ,1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc58 ,\ud835\udc41 } is made of the elements of the spectrum of \u221a \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58\ud835\udec0 \u221a \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 . As a result, we can write\n\ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc58 (\ud835\udec0\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 ) = \u221a\ufe01 \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 \u22121 \ud835\udc77\ud835\udc651\ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc58 (\ud835\udeba\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc58 )\ud835\udc77\u22121\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc58 \u221a\ufe01 \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 (133)\nwhere\n\ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc58 (\ud835\udeba\ud835\udc651) = diag ( \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc58 (\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc58 ,1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc58 (\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc58 ,\ud835\udc41 ) ) . (134)\nThus, evaluating the matrix maps boils down to the knowledge of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \u221a \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58\ud835\udec0 \u221a \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 . The question is whether these two must evaluated at every\ntime step, as \u221a \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc58 is a dynamical variable: unfortunately this is the case."

            "text": "This paper is focused mostly on the uniform mean field projection \ud835\udec01. Before concluding, we wish to numerically simulate also the case of a PEDS with a different projection operator. Let us consider a PEDS where \ud835\udec0 = \ud835\udc69\ud835\udc61 (\ud835\udc69\ud835\udc69\ud835\udc61)\u22121\ud835\udc69, where \ud835\udc69 is a random square matrix (uniformly distributed on [0, 1]) of size \ud835\udc41 \u00d7 \ud835\udc3e. The scalar target dynamical system we are interested in is again\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65) = \u2212\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc49 (\ud835\udc65) \ud835\udf15\ud835\udc65 . (157)\nwith the potential in (136), choosing parameters \ud835\udc4e4 = \ud835\udc4e0 = 0, \ud835\udc4e3 = \u22122, \ud835\udc4e2 = \u221210 and \ud835\udc4e1 = 9.85 that guarantee a single potential minimum, as shown Fig. 10 (left). We then consider the PEDS O = ( \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc65),\ud835\udec0,\u2212\ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec0) \u00ae\ud835\udc4b,\ud835\udec0\u00ae1, \ud835\udc41), with \ud835\udc41 = 50, and follow the\nobservable \ud835\udc65 = P\ud835\udec0 \u00ae\ud835\udc4b. The results are shown in Fig. 10 (right). The PEDS embedding converges also in this case to the potential absolute minimum, thus confirming that a generalization of the results of this paper to arbitrary projectors is possible.\nAs a last comment, one of the main motivations for this study is that in circuits, conservation laws can be expressed in terms of projector operators. An example is the volatile but (almost) ideal memristor. A resistor with memory can be described, at the lowest level of approximation for a current controlled device, by an effective dynamical resistance depending on an internal parameter \ud835\udc65. In this sense, memristors are approximately described by the functional form \ud835\udc45(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc45off(1 \u2212 \ud835\udc65) + \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc45on, where \ud835\udc45on < \ud835\udc45off are the boundary resistances, and \ud835\udc65 \u2208 [0, 1]. We assume that the internal memory parameter \ud835\udc65 evolves according to a simple equation of the form \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65/\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc45on\ud835\udc3c/\ud835\udefd \u2212 \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc65. The parameters \ud835\udefc and \ud835\udefd are the decay constant and the effective activation voltage per unit time, respectively. For a recent paper which inspired this study, consider [30], where transitions between effective minima of a lower dimensional potential were observed. Using Ohm\u2019s law, we define voltage \ud835\udc49 = \ud835\udc45(\ud835\udc65)\ud835\udc3c, so as to obtain a normalized equation for \ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc61)\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc49 \ud835\udefd\n1 1 \u2212 \ud835\udf12\ud835\udc65 \u2212 \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc65 = \u2212\ud835\udefc \ud835\udf15\ud835\udc49 (\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc60) \ud835\udf15\ud835\udc65\n(158)\nwhere \ud835\udf12 = (\ud835\udc45off \u2212 \ud835\udc45on)/\ud835\udc45off and \ud835\udc60 = \ud835\udc46\ud835\udefc\ud835\udefd , with 0 \u2264 \ud835\udf12 \u2264 1 in the physically relevant cases, and \ud835\udc49 (\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc60) as an effective potential, where \ud835\udc46 is the voltage applied to the circuit, and \ud835\udc60 is a normalized quantity with units of inverse time.\nThe dynamics of a single memristor (158) is fully characterized by the gradient following the dynamics of the effective potential\n\ud835\udc49 (\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc60) = 1 2 \ud835\udc652 + \ud835\udc60 \ud835\udf12 log(1 \u2212 \ud835\udf12\ud835\udc65), (159)\nwith \ud835\udc60 = \ud835\udc46 \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefd ; the constant \ud835\udefc also acts as the learning rate in (158).\nFor a network of memristors, the differential equation for \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) is a set of coupled ODE of the form [23]:\n\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \u00ae\ud835\udc65 = 1 \ud835\udefd (\ud835\udc70 \u2212 \ud835\udf12\ud835\udec0\ud835\udc7f)\u22121\ud835\udec0 \u00ae\ud835\udc46 \u2212 \ud835\udefc\u00ae\ud835\udc65, (160)\nwhere \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61)\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 . The matrix \ud835\udec0 is the projection operator on the vector space of cycles of G,the graph representing the circuit [23], and, as discussed in the Introduction, a mathematical consequence of Kirchhoff\u2019s conservation laws. Now, we note that we can write (160) as:\n\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \u00ae\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udec0( 1 \ud835\udefd (\ud835\udc70 \u2212 \ud835\udf12\ud835\udec0\ud835\udc7f)\u22121\ud835\udec0 \u00ae\ud835\udc46 \u2212 \ud835\udefc\u00ae\ud835\udc65) \u2212 \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc70 \u2212\ud835\udec0)\u00ae\ud835\udc65, (161)\nwhich is exactly in the form of a PEDS, with a standard decay function. Thus, the results of [30] can be interpreted as the relaxation of the system towards the minima defined by the embedding function. If \ud835\udec0 = \ud835\udec01, then using the results of this paper we know that the potential (159) determines the effective minima of the system. However, in order to justify the presence of the rumbling transitions shown in [30], a deeper understanding of the PEDS properties for a general projector \ud835\udec0 is required."

This is the first of a series of papers formally investigating the projective embeddings of dynamical systems (PEDS) paradigm that we defined here. The purpose of this work was to formally show the properties of this type of embeddings, within the context of a particular projector matrix. As we have seen, their structure is such that for long times, the asymptotic equilibria of the target dynamical system can be recovered.\nWe have discussed in particular the case of the uniform mean field projector operator \u03a91,\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 = 1\ud835\udc41 . For this choice, we have been able to prove analytically that the asymptotic equilibria are strictly connected to those of the original system. Aside from establishing the formalism, this paper also established some exact results about how the embedding changes the properties of the dynamics critical, including the cases of unstable equilibria and saddle points.\nSpecifically, we have studied the embedding of \ud835\udc5a dimensional dynamical systems in \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5a-dimensional systems. The purpose of such embedding is to modify the nature of the fixed points of the dynamics, i.e. those satisfying {\u00ae\ud835\udc65\u2217 s.t. \ud835\udc51\u00ae\ud835\udc65/\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 |\u00ae\ud835\udc65\u2217 = 0}. In particular, we have shown that stable and saddle type fixed points retain their properties, while unstable fixed points become saddles. This observation justify future works in this direction, in particular exploiting different types of decay functions, matrix embeddings and projectors with respect to this contribution. It is worth to mention that a follow up of this work is in preparation, in which we discuss the behavior of PEDS for general projectors; many of the results on the Jacobian obtain in this paper do actually apply also in the general case [? ].\nAn important aspect of interest of future works will be to focus on how to further modify the spectral properties of the fixed points, i.e. the nature of the Jacobian once\nevaluated at \u00ae\ud835\udc65\u2217. What we have shown in the present paper is that, for the uniform projector, the PEDS Jacobian is always symmetric, and thus characterized by real eigenvalues, that in particular are negative if the corresponding fixed point of the target system is stable. This implies that the dynamics near stable fixed points is always laminar, e.g. slowly decaying towards the fixed point. As we will see in future works, this is not the case for general projectors, for which approximate but special techniques will have to be employed.\nAs discussed, the spectral signature is in part inherited by the original, target dynamical system, but modified through the extended number of dimensions. The idea of generalizing the space of solutions to higher dimensions is not new. In a way, the PEDS technique is in spirit close to both Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods [28] and the notion of lifts in convex optimization [29], but is specifically developed for the fixed points of dynamical systems.\nIn particular, in [30] it was observed that memristive circuits have an effective lower dimensional representation in terms of an effective potential, and that they can exhibit a \u201crumbling\u201d transition, i.e. a transient chaotic tunneling between local minima of a properly defined potential. As it turns out, such dynamics is only a particular case of the PEDS introduced here, in which the projector operator was given by random circuit connections.\nThe rumbling transition in [30] was pinpointed numerically to be due to an effective \u201cLyapunov force\u201d, shown to be present in connection with the rumbling transition phenomenon. Such force was defined essentially as a deviation from a mean field theory, and we provided evidence of an athermal and novel mechanism in which barrier escapes emerge in the effective description of a multi-particle system. This paper is a continuation of that work, attempting at generalizing those findings to general systems, although focusing specifically on a particular type of projector: in this case, these \u201cLyapunov\u201d forces are not present. Similar yet different types of behavior were also observed previously within the context of memory-based computing (memcomputing) solutions [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36].\nThe main focus of this paper represents a first step towards a clarification of the general reasons why the introduction of hidden variables in a dynamical system can lead to transitions between local and global minima of the effective description via instabilities in the full system. Since maxima can be turned into saddle points, generically there cannot be no \u201cbarriers\u201d when the target system is a gradient descent. However, as we will show formally in future works, in order to obtain the rumbling transitions, one has to go beyond the uniform mean field approximation and study a more general type of projector.\nClearly, the projective embedding studied in this paper can be employed in a variety of dynamical systems, including all sort of gradient-based dynamics, with applicability to machine learning and neural networks. These applications will also be the subject of future studies. In particular, we hope that the introduction of \u201chidden variables\u201d in dynamical systems [37] can be further investigated for the purpose of machine learning and optimization applications [38]. In general, the study of transient chaos in dynamical systems and optimization [39, 40] is an interesting area of research with possible applications also in memristor-based algorithms [41].\nAcknowledgments.
