In their thinnest form they consist of a layer of carbon or nitrogen sandwiched in between two transition metal layers. Since electronic structure calculations have demonstrated all pristine MXenes to be metallic4, they are prime candidates to host superconductivity in the 2D limit. Our recent first-principles exploration has revealed the occurrence of 2D superconductivity in six MXene compounds with superconducting critical temperatures ranging from 2 to 16 K7. The highest Tc\u2019s were obtained for Mo- and Wbased MXenes, with the maximum Tc of 16 K found for Mo2N7. In addition, interplay between the superconducting state and a charge density wave phase, manifesting itself as an instability in the phonon dispersion, was found for W2N7.\nOn the other hand, pristine Nb2C was predicted as nonsuperconducting7, as recently confirmed experimentally8. The same experiment showed, however, that superconductivity can\naDepartment of Physics & NANOlab Center of Excellence, University of Antwerp, Groenenborgerlaan 171, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium bDepartment of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Eskisehir Technical University, 26555 Eskisehir, Turkey \u2217 jonas.bekaert@uantwerpen.be \u00a7 milorad.milosevic@uantwerpen.be \u2021These authors contributed equally to this work. \u2020 Electronic Supplementary Information (ESI) available: Phonon band structures, electronic band structures, Fermi surfaces incl.

These results demonstrate the potential of surface-functionalization to induce and enhance superconductivity in MXenes.\nIn this work, we focus on functionalization of MXenes with hydrogen (H). H has recently been established as a key element to achieve phonon-mediated high-temperature superconductivity. Its inherently high-frequency phonon modes have brought the superconducting critical temperatures (Tc) of hydride compounds under high pressure to unrivaled heights, up to room temperature9\u201313. However, the need for ultrahigh pressures \u2013 as high as 267 GPa for the recent carbonaceous sulfur hydride with recordholding Tc 13 \u2013 severely limits practical applications of this type of room-temperature superconductivity.\nDepositing hydrogen adatoms on a 2D material provides a very effective way to take advantage of the hydrogen-induced boost in the electron-phonon coupling (EPC), without the need for any applied pressure. This principle has been demonstrated for hydrogenated monolayer MgB2 14 \u2013 with a Tc of 67 K, which can be boosted to over 100 K by applying biaxial tensile strain \u2013 as well as for the elemental 2D material gallenene15. These systems inherit the stability of the 2D host material, while at the same time they are very rich in hydrogen, as needed for a sizeable effect on the superconducting properties. The enhancement of the EPC originates from (i) hybridization between electronic and vibrational states of hydrogen and the host atoms, and (ii) emerging ultrahigh frequency modes of hydrogen, expanding the frequency range of the EPC14. In addition to the effect on the superconducting state, our results on stability, structural and electronic properties of hydrogenated MXenes are also expected to stimu-\nJournal Name, [year], [vol.],1\u20136 | 1\nar X\niv :2\n20 4.\n03 98\n1v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\nup r-\nco n]\n8 A\npr 2\n02 2\nlate ongoing efforts to employ MXenes for hydrogen storage16,17."

We used the Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE) functional in combination with the relativistic Hartwigsen\u2013Goedecker\u2013Hutter (HGH) pseudopotentials19. Considering the marginal effect of spin-orbit-coupling (SOC) on the superconducting properties of the pristine form of these crystals7, we proceeded without taking SOC into account. Within the HGH pseudopotentials, 14 valence electrons for the transition metal elements and 4 (5) valence electrons for C (N) were taken into account. To achieve a high accuracy an energy cutoff of 60 Ha for the plane-wave basis, a dense 32\u00d732\u00d71 kpoint grid, 16\u00d716\u00d71 q-point grid, and at least 16 \u00c5 of vacuum in the unit cell were used. Fermi-Dirac smearing with broadening of 0.01 Ha was used throughout the calculations (except where indicated otherwise, namely a reduced value of 0.0025 Ha was used in certain DFPT calculations to identify emerging lattice instabilities). To further characterize the changes in the Fermi surfaces due to hydrogenation we have calculated the Fermi velocities from the electronic band structures by vF = h\u0304\u22121\u2207k\u03b5k |\u03b5=EF .\nFor the superconducting state we have applied Eliashberg theory, a quantitatively accurate extension to the Bardeen\u2013Cooper\u2013Schrieffer (BCS) theory for phonon-mediated superconductivity20\u201322.

Hence, both from the dynamical and thermodynamic point of view MD2 is unfavorable. The fact that MD1 is identified here as the energetically preferred structure is corroborated by experimental results on Ti2CT2 (T=S,Cl,Se,Br), for which the same preferred structure has been reported8.

The Fermi surface of pristine Mo2C consists of three distinct groups of sheets. Around \u0393, there are six small electron-like pockets and a larger circular electron-like, while centered around M there is an oval sheet, almost touching the larger \u0393-centered sheet along the \u0393-M direction7. In the hydrogenated case, all four Fermi sheets of Mo2CH2 (MD1) are \u0393-centered, and have distinctly six-fold symmetries, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The loss of Fermi sheets centered around M upon hydrogenation reduces the density of states at the Fermi level (NF ) to 2.09 eV\u22121, compared with 3.19 eV\u22121 in the case of pristine Mo2C7. Likewise, the Fermi sheets around M have considerably shrunk in MD3 and MD4 of Mo2CH2 (see Supplemental Material), leading to a similar reduction in NF w.r.t. the pristine case \u2013 see Table 1.\nOn the other hand, the DOS at EF of Mo2N is enhanced upon hydrogenation for all stable structural models w.r.t. the pristine value of 2.58 eV\u22121 7. MD3 of Mo2NH2 is characterized by a particularly high NF of 6.75 eV\u22121 per unit cell. Its Fermi level coincides exactly with a pronounced peak in the DOS, as shown in Fig. 2(d). The corresponding Fermi surface is depicted in Fig. 2(b), consisting of multiple hole pockets in the vicinity of \u0393, surrounded by a quasi-circular sheet further away from \u0393, and two large entwined sheets wrapping around the Brillouin zone edge.

Overall, in all three compounds, H contributes high-frequency phonon modes in the range of 100\u2013150 meV. In the case of Mo2CH2, the addition of hydrogen also leads to significant softening of the Mo-based ZA phonon mode, particularly around the M point [Fig. 3(a)]. In this compound, the contributions of the different atoms to the phonon band structure are well-separated, owing to the large differences in atomic masses between Mo, C and H. Akin to the case of pure Mo2N7, the phonon modes due to N and H are more dispersive in Mo2NH2 [Fig. 3(b)]. Pristine W2N was demonstrated to host a charge density wave(CDW)-type instability in its vibrational states, centered around the M point. Our DFPT calculations for W2NH2 in MD1 show that this instability persists, albeit around a different wavevector, namely at 2/3 \u0393-M (Fig. 3(c))."

We obtained considerable enhancements of the EPC constants upon hydrogenation for all considered compounds, as shown in Fig. 4, albeit based on different mechanisms. The full results for the Tc\u2019s of the different compounds are summarized in Table 1.\nAs discussed in Section 4, the electronic DOS at EF of Mo2CH2 is depleted compared with pristine Mo2C. This is in principle detrimental to the EPC since \u03bb \u221d NF . However, this effect is amply compensated by the softening of the flexural ZA phonon mode, boosting \u03bb owing to its dependence on \u03b12F/\u03c9 (as introduced in Section 2). Similar strong EPC hosted by a flexural mode also occurs in pristine Mo2N, resulting in its enhanced superconducting Tc compared with Mo2C7. As a result, the EPC constant is enhanced from \u03bb = 0.75 in pristine Mo2C to \u03bb = 1.12 in Mo2CH2 (MD1), as shown in Fig. 4(a), and the corresponding Tc increases\nJournal Name, [year], [vol.],1\u20136 | 3\nfrom 7.1 K to 12.6 K. MD of Mo2CH2 has a comparable Tc of 11.8 K, while the Tc of MD4 is significantly depleted (5.5 K).\nOn the other hand, the main contribution to the enhanced Tc of Mo2NH2 and W2NH2 is the increase in NF upon hydrogenation, as discussed in Section 4. In the case of Mo2NH2 (MD3) (see Fig. 4(b)), the EPC attains a particularly high value of 2.67 \u2013 more than double the value obtained for pristine Mo2N (1.2)7 \u2013 yielding a high Tc of 32.4 K. As MD1 and MD4 of Mo2NH2 have a considerably lower DOS at EF , their Tc\u2019s are limited to 21.5 K and 14.7 K respectively \u2013 the former still exceeding the Tc of 16 K of pristine Mo2N7.\nLikewise, the EPC of W2NH2 (MD1) is enhanced to an elevated value of 1.91, yielding a Tc of 30.7 K. Interestingly, the contribution of in-plane H modes, situated in the range 100\u2013120 meV, to the EPC in W2NH2 is particularly strong, as shown in Fig. 4(c). The other dynamically stable models of W2NH2 (MD3 and MD4) also produce sizeable Tc\u2019s (22.0 K and 26.7 K).\nOur first-principles characterization of the different hydrogenated MXene compounds also enables the calculation of superconducting length scales, such as coherence lengths, through the\nGinzburg-Landau relation \u03be (0) = \u221a\n7\u03b6 (3) 3 h\u0304vF 4\u03c0Tc 26, where vF is the average Fermi velocity.

However, the majority of MXene compounds based on group-5 elements were found to be non-superconducting, due to a lack of sufficiently strong EPC. The absence of superconductivity in pristine Nb2C has indeed been confirmed experimentally8. While previous experimental studies have shown the emergence of superconductivity in Nb2C under the influence of surface functionalization8,27,28,\nreaching Tc\u2019s up to 6 K in case of Cl and S adatoms, and up to 7 K for NH functional groups8, the effect of hydrogen adatoms has not yet been considered.\nJust as for the Mo- and W-based hydrogenated MXenes presented above, MD2 of Nb2CH2 is found to be dynamically unstable, having evanescent phonon modes with predominant hydrogen character (see the SM). In case of MD1 and MD3, the contributions of niobium and carbon to the Eliashberg function and the EPC are largely unaltered compared with pristine Nb2C, as shown in Fig. 5(a,b). However, the hydrogen-based phonon modes contribute additional EPC channels, enhancing the EPC constant \u03bb to 0.42 and 0.43 for MD1 and MD3 respectively. A notable difference between these two cases is that the hydrogen phonon modes form a single band in MD1 (centered around 120 meV), while in MD3 they split into two separate bands (the lower band lies in the range of 90\u2212 100 meV and the upper band in the range of 120\u2212135 meV; see also the SM). The relatively modest enhancements of the EPC due to the hydrogen phonon modes nevertheless suffice to induce superconductivity in MD1 and MD3 of Nb2CH2, with Tc\u2019s of 0.8 K and 1.0 K respectively.\nAs shown in Fig. 5(c), MD4 of Nb2CH2 hosts enhanced coupling to niobium- and carbon-based phonon modes (as opposed to MD1 and MD3), combined with additional EPC due to hydrogen modes, yielding a total EPC constant \u03bb of 0.51 and a Tc of 2.9 K."

Our analysis of the dynamical and thermodynamic stability of hydrogenated molybdenum- and tungsten-based MXenes has yielded three different stable structures (see Fig. 1), consistently harboring enhanced EPC and therefore elevated superconducting Tc\u2019s.\nSeveral mechanisms for the enhanced superconducting properties were identified. Firstly, enhanced EPC due to a softened flexural phonon mode, e.g. in the Mo-based flexural mode of Mo2CH2. Secondly, an increase in the electronic DOS at the Fermi\n4 | 1\u20136Journal Name, [year], [vol.],\nlevel due to charge transfer from hydrogen to the MXene layer occurs in several compounds, such as Mo2NH2 and W2NH2. Combined with flat segments in the electronic dispersion, this results in a Van Hove singularity in the DOS around the Fermi level in Mo2NH2 (see Fig. 2(d)) \u2013 akin to the case of hydrogenated monolayer MgB2 14. This enhances the EPC constant to 2.67, more than double the value obtained for pristine Mo2N7, and an elevated Tc of 32 K. Finally, additional contributions to the EPC appear upon hydrogenation, directly stemming from the hydrogen-based phonon modes. The latter mechanism is observed in all studied compounds, but is particularly strong in case of the in-plane hydrogen phonon modes of W2NH2 (see Fig. 4(c)).\nIn addition, we have demonstrated that superconductivity can even be induced by hydrogenation in MXenes which are otherwise non-superconducting in pristine form, such as Nb2C (see Fig. 5).\nAltogether our results clearly demonstrate that the supercon-\nducting properties of the broad family of MXene materials can be engineered through surface functionalization, corroborating recent experimental advances8,27,28. Moreover, the hydrogenated MXenes studied here present another important class of 2D materials in which hydrogen adatoms boost the EPC and the superconducting Tc, extending significantly prior results for pdoped graphane29, hydrogenated monolayer MgB2 14, and hydrogenated gallium monolayers (gallenane)15.\nConflicts of interest There are no conflicts to declare."
