However, external validations are lacking. Therefore, we have used a Dutch sample of general psychiatric patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (N = 637) to evaluate the performance of OxMIV in predicting interpersonal violence over 3 years. The predictors and outcome were measured with standardized instruments and multiple sources of information. Patients were mostly male (n = 493, 77%) and, on average, 27 (SD = 7) years old. The outcome rate was 9% (n = 59). Discrimination, as measured by the area under the curve, was moderate at 0.67 (95% confidence interval 0.61\u20130.73). Calibration-in-the-large was adequate, with a ratio between predicted and observed events of 1.2 and a Brier score of 0.09. At the individual level, risks were systematically underestimated in the original model, which was remedied by recalibrating the intercept and slope of the model. Probability scores generated by the recalibrated model can be used as an adjunct to clinical decision-making in Dutch mental health services.",

Probability scores generated by the recalibrated model can be used as an adjunct to clinical decision-making in Dutch mental health services.\nStructured tools for violence risk assessment are increasingly used to inform decisions around admission, discharge and treatment of psychiatric patients1. However, their suitability for patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders is questionable. The most widely used tools, such as the Historical, Clinical and Risk Management-20 (HCR-20), Violence Risk Appraisal Guide (VRAG) and Level of Service Inventory (LSI)2, were developed in other populations and with methods that are now considered low quality (e.g., absence of a study\u00a0protocol, small and selected samples, vague or undefined risk categories)3. Moreover, they have rarely been validated in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and have low-to-moderate discrimination across psychiatric populations. A systematic review identified two tools, the HCR-20 and VRAG, that were validated in outpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (twice each). The median areas under the curve (AUCs)\u00a0had wide ranges (interquartile range [IQR] = 0.60\u20130.77). In outpatients with any diagnosis, the median AUCs of the 10 included tools ranged from 0.62 to 0.854. Another systematic review found an aggregated median AUC of 0.69 (IQR = 0.62\u20130.75) for 7 tools validated in diagnostically heterogenous samples of inpatients5. None of the validation studies, in either review, reported calibration measures. Finally, current tools are resource intensive. They typically take several hours to complete and cost hundreds of dollars in manuals and training6. By contrast, other areas of medicine, in particular cardiology, have developed scalable tools that can be used by clinicians to discuss health\u00a0risks with patients7.\nA tool that overcomes many of these limitations is Oxford Mental Illness and Violence (OxMIV). It is freely available online (https:// oxrisk. com/ oxmiv-7/), relies on routinely collected information, and requires no formal training. The model was derived and externally validated in a total population cohort of over 75 000 Swedish individuals with schizophrenia spectrum or bipolar disorder.

Upon entry of the 16 items, OxMIV estimates the probability of violent offending within 1 year. This estimate is expressed as a percentage, capped at 20%.

A recent study in Germany found moderate discrimination (AUC = 0.72) for the prediction of inpatient violence in a forensic setting9.\nHowever, further studies are needed to validate OxMIV for different countries, care settings and forms of violent behaviour. The last are relevant because all violence (not\u00a0solely incidents leading to arrest and conviction) has negative consequences, including treatment disruption, morbidity in victims, costs to services10 and stigmatisation of patients11, and may accurately be predicted by OxMIV. Therefore, we have evaluated the performance of OxMIV in predicting interpersonal violence over a 3-year period in a Dutch sample of general psychiatric patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. We also explored the feasibility of adjusting OxMIV for this population and outcome."

            "text": "Setting and participants. Data were collected as part of a larger research project, called Genetic Risk and Outcome of Psychosis (GROUP). The GROUP project was conducted by four university hospitals and affiliated mental healthcare centres (k = 36) in the Netherlands. These institutions are located in representative geographical areas of the country and provide access to psychiatric treatment in a variety of settings (e.g., psychiatric hospitals, outpatient clinics, residential care) to approximately 75% of the population. Throughout 2004, consecutive patients were invited to participate if they met the following criteria: (1) age between 16 and 50; (2) good command of the Dutch language; and (3) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR)12 diagnosis of schizophrenia or other non-affective psychotic disorder. Their parents and siblings were also invited. In total, 1013 patients, 907 parents and 1061 siblings enrolled. Assessments took place at the university hospitals, with a follow-up at 3 years. The protocol for the GROUP project was approved centrally by the ethics committee of the University Medical Centre Utrecht and implemented in accordance with relevant guidelines. All participants gave written informed consent before the first assessment.\nPredictors and outcome. We selected variables whose definitions most closely matched those in the derivation study. The definitions of the predictors (Table\u00a0S1) and the instruments used to measure them (Table\u00a0S2) can be found in the supplement. The psychometric properties of the instruments and training of research personnel have been described elsewehere13. The patients themselves provided information on all predictors, apart from \u2018parental drug or alcohol misuse\u2019 (parents), \u2018parental violence\u2019 (parents) and \u2018sibling violence\u2019 (siblings). For the predictors \u2018parental violence\u2019, \u2018sibling violence\u2019 and \u2018personal income\u2019, data were only collected at three of the four university hospitals. We excluded cannabis from the predictors \u2018previous drug misuse\u2019 and \u2018parental alcohol or drug misuse\u2019, as their prevalence would otherwise have been considerably higher than in the derivation sample (46% vs. 12% and 20% vs. 11%, respectively). Furthermore, we have previously shown that, in the current sample, the contribution of cannabis misuse to violence is small and nonsignificant when adjusted for background factors14. A possible explanation for both observations is that, unlike in Sweden, cannabis use is not criminalised in the Netherlands.\nThe outcome was physical abuse of another person\u00a0(i.e. interpersonal violence) during the 3 years of follow-up, ascertained from clinical case notes and patient interviews. The definition (physical abuse vs. violent offending) and time period (3 years vs. 1 year) thus differed from the outcome OxMIV\u00a0is designed to predict.\nStatistical analysis. We aimed to validate and, if necessary, update OxMIV for a different population (i.e., general psychiatric patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders in the Netherlands) and outcome (i.e., interpersonal violence over 3 years). For model updating, we followed an incremental strategy suggested previously15,16. This strategy involves\u00a0up to three steps: (1) recalibrating the intercept; (2) recalibrating the intercept and slope; and (3) re-estimating one or more coefficients. Performance was assessed in terms of calibration, both \u2018in the large\u2019 (with the ratio between predicted and observed events across the sample and the Brier score) and at the individual level (through calibration plots), and discrimination. We calculated the following discrimination metrics: AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPVs) and negative (NPVs) predictive values. Wilson\u2019s method17 was used to construct 95% confidence intervals around the last four of these. Discrimination was also visualised with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. To aid interpretation, we presented results for the following probability thresholds: 5% (the default), 10%, 15% and 20% (the cap).\nBased on its distribution in the Dutch population, the predictor \u2018personal income\u2019 was converted into deciles. Patients with \u2018unstable\u2019 incomes belonged to deciles 1\u20133, and those with \u2018stable\u2019 incomes to deciles 4\u20131018. The corresponding model coefficients were averaged. Since the predictor \u2018recent (substance) dependence treatment\u2019 was not available, we assigned the derivation sample proportion to all patients. The same was done with patients who had ever been admitted to a psychiatric hospital for the predictor \u2018currently an inpatient\u2019. Others were assumed to be outpatients. For partially missing predictors, we used multiple imputation by chained equations. As recommended, the outcome was excluded from the imputation models18. We averaged values across 20 imputations. Among the predictors measured at all sites, proportions of missing data were modest (\u2264 13%) (Table\u00a0S3). Insofar data were missing due to local practice, they can reasonably be assumed to be missing at random. Missingness on most predictors correlated significantly (p < 0.05) with values on at least one other predictor (Table\u00a0S4).\nOutcome data were available for 637 (63%) patients. As outcomes should not be imputed in external validation19, these patients formed the sample used in the analyses. They typically had attained a higher level of education (\u03c72 [2] = 12.18, p = 0.002) and were less likely to receive benefits (\u03c72 [1] = 5.42, p = 0.020) than patients without outcome data. No significant differences were observed for any of the other predictors (Table S5).\n3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:461 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-04266-9\nAnalyses were carried out in SPSS 21.0 and Stata 12.1.

Previous violence (n = 115, 21%) and drug misuse (n = 118, 20%) were each present in about one in five patients. Almost all patients (n = 565, 95%) had taken antipsychotics in the past 6 months. Fifty-nine (9%) patients physically assaulted another person during the 3 years after baseline.\nDiscrimination, as measured by the AUC, was moderate at 0.67 (95% CI 0.61\u20130.73). The ROC curve is shown in Fig.\u00a01. The original model had low sensitivity (25%) and high specificity (90%) at the default threshold of 5%. The same pattern was observed for the PPV (21%) and NPV (92%) (Table\u00a02). Calibration-in-the-large was satisfactory, with a ratio between predicted and observed events of 1.2 and a Brier score of 0.09 (Table\u00a03). At the individual level, however, risks were systematically underestimated. This was remedied by recalibration of the intercept and slope (updating step ii) (Fig.\u00a02 and, for the model formula, Table\u00a0S6). Re-estimation of coefficients (updating step iii) was therefore not necessary. When using a threshold of 10%, the model with the recalibrated intercept and slope also offered a better balance between sensitivity (47%) and specificity (73%) than the original model (Table\u00a02).\nPredictor Summary\nMale sex 493 (77%)\nAge M (SD) = 27 (7)\nPrevious violence 115 (21%)\nPrevious drug misuse 118 (20%)\nPrevious alcohol misuse 79 (13%)\nPrevious self-harm 142 (23%)\nEducational level\n\u00a0Lower secondary 265 (42%)\n\u00a0Upper secondary 177 (28%)\n\u00a0Post-secondary 189 (30%)\nParental drug or alcohol misuse 63 (18%)\nParental violence 13 (5%)\nSibling violence 47 (12%)\nRecent antipsychotic treatment 565 (95%)\nRecent antidepressant treatment 147 (23%)\nUnstable income 369 (80%)\nBenefit recipient 276 (46%)\nFigure\u00a01.

            "text": "In a Dutch sample of 637 general psychiatric patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, we evaluated the performance of a newly developed risk assessment tool (OxMIV) in predicting interpersonal violence over 3 years. We found OxMIV performed moderately well, especially considering that it is designed to predict a different outcome (i.e., violent offending within 1 year). The broader definition of the outcome and longer followup period may partly explain why we obtained a lower AUC (0.67, 95% CI 0.61\u20130.73) than previous validation studies of OxMIV7,8. At the same time,\u00a0it is comparable to AUCs reported by validation studies of other\u00a0more resource-intensive tools4,, and the current study is an external validation using a different clinically informative outcome. Furthermore, unlike other tools, where calibration has\u00a0not been reported, OxMIV demonstrated\u00a0good calibration in the large.\u00a0In addition, we showed that the\u00a0performance of OxMIV\u00a0can be optimised with model updating: calibration at the individual level was adequate after recalibration of the intercept and slope.\u00a0This is important\u00a0methodologically as it provides\u00a0an approach to test the performance of\u00a0prediction models and risk assessment tools for a\u00a0different outcome\u00a0than in their derivation/development\u00a0studies.\u00a0\nStrengths of this study include the representativeness of the sample, use of multiple data sources for the outcome, prespecification of the methods, and presentation of a wide range of performance measures. However, there are some limitations. First, most predictors were defined differently than in the derivation study (Table\u00a0S1). The distribution of predictors differed as well. Of note, the proportion of men was larger (77% vs. 49%), mean\nTable 2. Discrimination metrics for the original and recalibrated models.

These differences may have hampered the performance of OxMIV. At the same time, they reflect the profile of patients presenting at mental health services in the Netherlands where information is not always available to align predictors exactly with those in the derivation study, and external\u00a0validations with\u00a0patient groups with different baseline\u00a0characteristics provide evidence whether\u00a0a\u00a0tool\u2019s performance can\u00a0be maintained in real-world\u00a0clinical settings and practice. Another limitation was the relatively small number of patients with the outcome. It has been suggested that \u2265 100 events are required to reliably measure predictive accuracy21. For this reason, the findings may be considered preliminary rather than definitive. Finally, missing data may have introduced bias. However, multiple imputation would have reduced this bias in the predictors22, and patients with and without outcome data were similar on nearly all predictors.\nThe findings suggest that OxMIV is suitable for predicting violent behaviour in Dutch patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Clinicians are advised to use the probability scores generated by the model with the recalibrated intercept and slope, as it had the best individual-level calibration and discrimination was worse\u00a0at the chosen thresholds. This\u00a0revised model can be accessed on the OxRisk\u00a0website\u00a0(https:// oxrisk. com). The original model can be used to screen patients for low risk of violence (< 5%), as facilitated by the high NPV (92%). The low PPV (21%) suggests that patients should be assessed further if classified as high\u00a0risk (\u2265 5%). There remains a need for validation studies in which variable definitions more closely match those in the derivation study and the number of events is higher. Comparing the performance of OxMIV against other tools or investigating its clinical feasibility could also be considered."
