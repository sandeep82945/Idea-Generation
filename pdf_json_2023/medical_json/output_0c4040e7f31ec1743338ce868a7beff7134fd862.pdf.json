Current research mainly focused on drivers\u2019 mental model of adaptive cruise control (ACC) and lane centering control (LCC), but rarely investigated drivers\u2019 understanding of emerging driving automation functions beyond ACC and LCC.\nMethods: To address this research gap, 287 valid responses from ADAS users in the Chinese market, were collected in a survey study targeted toward state-of-theart ADAS (e.g., autopilot in Tesla). Through cluster analysis, drivers were clustered into four groups based on their knowledge of traditional ACC and LCC functions, knowledge of functions beyond ACC and LCC, and knowledge of ADAS limitations. Predictors of driver grouping were analyzed, and we further modeled drivers\u2019 trust in ADAS.\nResults: Drivers in general had weak knowledge of LCC functions and functions beyond ACC and LCC, and only 27 (9%) of respondents had a relatively strong mental model of ACC and LCC. At the same time, years of licensure, weekly driving distance, ADAS familiarity, driving style (i.e., planning), and personability (i.e., agreeableness) were associated with drivers\u2019 mental model of ADAS. Further, it was found that the mental model of ADAS, vehicle brand, and drivers\u2019 age, ADAS experience, driving style (i.e., focus), and personality (i.e., emotional stability) were significant predictors of drivers\u2019 trust in ADAS.\nDiscussion: These findings provide valuable insights for the design of driver education and training programs to improve driving safety with ADAS.\nKEYWORDS\nmental model, trust, ADAS, survey study, cluster analysis\n1. Introduction\nAdvanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) have developed rapidly and have become increasingly prevalent worldwide over the past decade (Winter et\u00a0al., 2014; Banks and Stanton, 2016; Litman, 2020). Typically, ADAS in SAE Level 2 level (SAE International, 2021) can provide vehicle control in the longitudinal direction with adaptive cruise control (ACC) or cruise control systems, and in the lateral direction with lane keeping assistance"

With the advancement in hardware (e.g., sensing technologies) and software (e.g., computer vision algorithms) in recent years, new ADAS functions beyond ACC and LCC (e.g., automated lane changing, and automated overtaking) are being integrated into vehicles. Further, instead of introducing each ADAS function as an independent system, vehicle companies tend to \u201cpack\u201d all ADAS functions as a single system. For example, Tesla names its ADAS as Navigate on Autopilot (NOA) (Tesla, 2020) and XPeng names its ADAS as Navigation Guided Pilot (NGP) (XPeng Motors, 2021), both include all functions of ACC and LCC, but can also functions beyond ACC and LCC. To differentiate the driving automation systems such as NOA and NGP from traditional SAE Level 2 ADAS that consists of ACC and LCC, throughout this paper, we\u00a0will name driving automation systems such as NOA and NGP as advanced Level 2 ADAS.\nHowever, it should be\u00a0 noted that regardless of how vehicle manufacturers name them, users of these advanced Level 2 ADAS (i.e., NOA and NGP) are still expected to be\u00a0responsible for the driving task and be\u00a0ready to quickly take over control of the vehicle in case of emergency. Thus, users\u2019 knowledge of and trust in ADAS may still play a critical role in driving safety. To systematically evaluate users\u2019 knowledge of ADAS, previous studies used the concept of ADAS mental model and defined it as drivers\u2019 understanding of the functions, limitations, and capabilities of ADAS (e.g., Beggiato and Krems, 2013; Beggiato et\u00a0al., 2015; Rossi et\u00a0al., 2020; Pai et\u00a0al., 2023). However, to the best of our knowledge, most existing research mainly focused on traditional ADAS technologies (e.g., Beggiato and Krems, 2013; Beggiato et\u00a0al., 2015; DeGuzman and Donmez, 2021a,b; Lubkowski et\u00a0al., 2021). Given that even experienced ADAS users have difficulty understanding all capabilities and limitations of ACC and LCC (DeGuzman and Donmez, 2021b), it may be\u00a0more challenging for drivers to build well-calibrated mental models of advanced Level-2 ADAS, especially the functions and limitations of the sub-systems beyond ACC and LCC.\nThe misuse of the ADAS has contributed to a large number of accidents in the past few years (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2022). Considering the increasing market share of advanced Level-2 ADAS, to ensure drivers\u2019 proper use of the state-of-the-art ADAS technologies, it becomes urgent to understand how well drivers know about ADAS and what factors influence drivers\u2019 knowledge of ADAS, which could help calibrate users\u2019 trust in these systems and avoid overuse or misuse of them. More importantly, according to the data collected by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in China (Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, 2022), in the first six months of 2022, more than 2.88 million passenger cars with ADAS were sold in China (accounting for 32.4% of all vehicles sold in that period) and with a year-on-year growth of 46.2% (NetEase Auto, 2022). However, no research has been conducted among Chinese drivers to explore their mental models of and trust in ADAS. Due to the potential cultural differences between Chinese drivers and drivers with other culture background, it is important to investigate Chinses drivers\u2019 mental models of and trust in ADAS, especially considering the rapidly increasing of ADAS penetration rate in China."

            "text": "To secure the benefits of ADAS, drivers need to have an appropriate understanding of how, when, and whether ADAS can be\u00a0used. Specifically, drivers\u2019 mental models of traditional Level-2 ADAS (i.e., knowledge of the functions and limitations of the ADAS) were found to be\u00a0 associated with driving safety, when either the driving automation was responsible for the longitudinal control (i.e., through ACC) or lateral control of the vehicles (i.e., through LCC) (Dickie and Boyle, 2009; Rossi et\u00a0al., 2020; Gaspar et\u00a0al., 2021).\nIn general, previous studies revealed that drivers who are less aware of the functions and limitations of traditional Level-2 automation (e.g., ACC and LCC) are more likely to fail regaining control of the vehicle when needed (Sol\u00eds-Marcos et\u00a0 al., 2018). For example, in a driving simulator study, Gaspar et\u00a0al. found that drivers with strong mental models of ACC were faster in responding to edge-case situations (i.e., when ACC failed to detect an approaching object in front) compared to those with weak mental models of ACC (Gaspar et\u00a0al., 2021). In another study, Dickie and Boyle found that drivers who were unaware or unsure of ACC limitations were more willing to use the automation in situations that were beyond the system\u2019s capabilities (Dickie and Boyle, 2009). At the same time, drivers who were unaware of ACC and LCC limitations have been shown to attend less to the road (Noble et\u00a0al., 2021), and be\u00a0more inclined to perform non-driving related tasks (Carsten et\u00a0al., 2012; Noble et\u00a0al., 2021), and thus be\u00a0less prepared to intervene when they need to (Winter et\u00a0al., 2014), which may impair traffic safety (Gold et\u00a0al., 2018; Wan and Changxu, 2018). As for the lateral control of the vehicle, through a driving simulator study, Rossi et al. (2020) found that in takeover scenarios, drivers\u2019 mental model of ADAS was a significant predictor of takeover effectiveness, as measured by the mean absolute lateral position and standard deviation (SD) of the lateral position of the vehicle. In the study, those who have ever read the information booklet of ADAS (i.e., the stronger mental model drivers) exhibited smaller SD of lateral position and responded faster in the events. Thus, it is necessary to help drivers construct a well-calibrated mental model to ensure safety benefits of ADAS."

            "text": "The relationship between the mental model and trust may explain the influence of the mental model on driving safety. Trust in automation can be\u00a0defined as \u201cthe attitude that an agent will help achieve an individual\u2019s goals in a situation characterized by uncertainty and vulnerability.\u201d (p.\u00a054 of Lee and See, 2004). Previous research has found that users\u2019 level of trust in ADAS has been associated with their performance in perceiving the environment (Radlmayr et\u00a0al., 2014), reacting to takeover events (Hergeth et\u00a0al., 2016; Payre et\u00a0al., 2016), and responding to hazards (Seppelt and Lee, 2007).\nDrivers\u2019 mental model of ADAS can influence their trust in the ADAS (Lee and See, 2004; Hoff and Bashir, 2015). For example, in a survey study conducted in North America, DeGuzman and Donmez found that among ADAS non-owners, those with a better mental model of the ADAS reported lower trust toward the ADAS (i.e., ACC\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nand LKA) (DeGuzman and Donmez, 2021b). In another survey study, drivers who were unaware or unsure of ACC limitations were found to be\u00a0 more willing to use the automation in situations that were beyond the system\u2019s capabilities (Dickie and Boyle, 2009), indicating these drivers may have over-trusted the ADAS they used.\nIt should be\u00a0 noted that drivers\u2019 trust in ADAS is not solely determined by the mental model of the system but can also be\u00a0moderated by other factors. According to the framework by Hoff and Bashir (2015), there are \u201cthree layers of variability in human\u2013automation trust,\u201d i.e., dispositional trust (i.e., an individual\u2019s overall tendency to trust automation, independent of context or a specific system), situational trust (i.e., transitory context characteristics, types of the system, its complexity and the difficulty of the tasks), and learned trust (i.e., an operators\u2019 evaluation of the systems learned from past experience or current interactions). Each layer of variability can be\u00a0 modulated by different factors. For example, dispositional trust might be\u00a0associated with age, gender, culture, personality traits; situational trust can be\u00a0influenced by system complexity and workload; and learned trust can be\u00a0 associated with users\u2019 experience with and understanding of the system, as well as their mental of the system. All the factors associated with different layers of trust can influence users\u2019 trust in automation directly or indirectly. For example, previous research found that factors from dispositional layer (e.g., age and education) (Gold et\u00a0al., 2015), situational layer (e.g., traffic density) (Li et\u00a0al., 2019) and learned layer (e.g., consistency of driver\u2019s driving style and the driving style of driving automation) (Ma and Zhang, 2020, 2021) can influence drivers\u2019 trust in ADAS. Thus, it is necessary to consider other potential moderating factors when investigating the relationships between the mental model and drivers\u2019 trust in ADAS."

            "text": "Though the mental model of ADAS is critical to driving safety, research has found that drivers generally have less than ideal mental models of traditional Level-2 ADAS in general. For instance, in a survey study, Dickie and Boyle (2009) found that only 42% of ACC owners were aware of the three ACC limitations mentioned in the survey. Similarly, Jenness et\u00a0al. (2008) found that 72% of ACC owners were not aware of some critical limitations of the ACC. In another survey study targeted toward Volvo XC60 (equipped with ACC system) owners, around 30% of the 130 respondents reported being unaware that the system has difficulty functioning in curves and roundabouts (Larsson, 2012). What is more alerting is that, though ACC has been available in the market for decades, a large number of drivers still have an incorrect perception of it according to more recent studies. For example, in a survey conducted in the US, McDonald et\u00a0 al. (2016) found that only 17% of the respondents correctly answered questions assessing their understanding of the ACC system. A more recent study by DeGuzman and Donmez (2021a) still found that 47% of owners hold misperceptions about the ACC systems (e.g., incorrectly thought that ACC systems would not have difficulty when driving on curvy roads or when approaching a stationary vehicle).\nNot just for ACC, drivers also have difficulty understanding other driving automation functions. In another survey study with over 1,500 drivers, Jenness et\u00a0al. (2007) found that 81% of respondents were unaware of any limitations of the sensor-based backing aid system, believing that the system was designed to detect the proximity of\npedestrians, children, pets, and stationary obstacles, which it was not designed to. Similarly, A driving simulator study found that, among 24 drivers with a basic understanding of the lane departure warning (LDW) system, 20 of them mistakenly believed that the system would work at any speed (Aziz et\u00a0al., 2013).\nIt is alerting that drivers have weak knowledge of ADAS functions that have been in the market for many years. The more recent and complex ADAS functions introduced in the past few years may bring even more challenges to drivers. Thus, it is urgent to assess drivers\u2019 mental models of advanced Level-2 ADAS."

According to the driving task model by Ranney (1994), traditional ADAS technologies (e.g., ACC and LCC) help drivers perform the driving task at the operational level and the judgment of the system performance can solely be\u00a0based on the perception of the current maneuver of the system. While emerging ADAS technologies (e.g., automatic lane changing) can help drivers perform the driving task at the tactical level. To judge the performance of and develop trust in these systems, drivers will need a higher level of situation awareness of the traffic scenario. The discrepancy of the required cognitive resource to judge the system performance may affect how the mental model and trust are built up and evolve when using traditional versus advanced ADAS. At the same time, given the expanding market share of advanced Level-2 ADAS and the increasing complexity of this system, existing research focusing on traditional ADAS functions (i.e., ACC, CC, LKA, or LCC) may not be\u00a0enough to support appropriate usage of the emerging technologies in vehicles. Further, the traditional functions in ADAS have been available in the market for an extended period and it is valuable to compare drivers\u2019 mental model of these emerging functions versus the mental models of functions that drivers are potentially more familiar with. This comparison can help better understand the impact of new vehicles technologies on the driving safety. Thus, our survey study targeted the functions and limitations of advanced Level-2 ADAS functions in addition to the traditional Level-2 ADAS functions.\nFurther, cultural difference has been identified as a potentially influential factor in users\u2019 trust in automation (Hoff and Bashir, 2015). Previous studies on drivers\u2019 mental model as well as trust toward driving automation mainly targeted toward users in North America (e.g., DeGuzman and Donmez, 2021a; Greenwood et\u00a0 al., 2022; Hungund and Pradhan, 2022) or Europe (e.g., Larsson, 2012; Beggiato and Krems, 2013; Beggiato et\u00a0al., 2015). Given the rapidly increasing market share of advanced Level-2 automation in China (Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, 2022), the increasing number of ADAS-related accidents in China (Autoevolution, 2021), and the potential cultural difference in Asia (Zaheer and Zaheer, 2006), understanding of Chinese drivers\u2019 mental model of ADAS may provide valuable insights on the design of customized in-vehicle interfaces and driver education programs.\nFor the current study, we\u00a0hypothesized that, compared to emerging ADAS technologies, drivers have better mental models of traditional ADAS technologies, given that understanding and judging emerging ADAS technologies require more cognitive resources compared to that\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nof traditional ADAS technologies. Inspired by previous studies (Beggiato and Krems, 2013; Beggiato et\u00a0 al., 2015; DeGuzman and Donmez, 2021a,b; Lubkowski et\u00a0 al., 2021; Greenwood et\u00a0 al., 2022), we\u00a0 also explored other potential related factors and we\u00a0expect that higher ADAS familiarity, higher technology familiarity, more ADAS experience, and higher ADAS frequency are positively associated with better ADAS mental models, while involving in ADAS-related accident is negatively associated with drivers\u2019 trust in ADAS. As for the relationship between drivers\u2019 mental models of ADAS and trust in ADAS, in general, we\u00a0hypothesize that better mental model is associated with lower trust in ADAS (Pai et\u00a0al., 2023), but this trend can be\u00a0modulated by other factors. For example, previous research found that the experience of using ADAS might weaken the influence of mental model on trust (DeGuzman and Donmez, 2021a)."

            "text": "In total, 49 statements were designed to assess drivers\u2019 mental model of ADAS based on a review of previous relevant studies\n(Beggiato and Krems, 2013; Beggiato et\u00a0al., 2015; Abraham et\u00a0al., 2017; McDonald et\u00a0 al., 2018; DeGuzman and Donmez, 2021a,b) and a thorough review of user manuals and official training materials from vehicle manufacturers. The statements targeted toward functions and limitations of traditional Level-2 ADAS and advanced Level-2 ADAS systems and can be\u00a0categorized into four parts, each targeting toward one type of ADAS-related knowledge, i.e., ACC-related functions, LCC-related functions, functions beyond ACC & LCC, and ADAS limitations.\nThe ACC-related functions and LCC-related functions parts included statements of what ACC can do (e.g., \u201cwhen you\u00a0drive with ADAS on, the system can help you\u00a0maintain a pre-set speed\u201d) and LCC can do (e.g., \u201cwhen you\u00a0 drive with ADAS on, the system can help maintain the vehicle in the center of the lane\u201d). The functions beyond ACC & LCC part assessed participants\u2019 understanding of what the sub-systems beyond ACC and LCC can do. The \u201cbeyond\u201d sub-systems include flexible speed control (which can adjust the speed based on road environment such as curvature of the road), automatic stopand-go (which can continuously follow the lead vehicle in a traffic jam), automatic lane changing (which can automatically change lanes when users turn on turning light or when the lead vehicle is too slow), road assistant (which can identify traffic lights and traffic signs), and driver monitoring & warning (which can monitor drivers\u2019 behaviors during driving and initiate warnings when necessary). The ADASlimitations group included statements regarding the limitations and boundaries of the ADAS sub-systems (e.g., \u201cwhen you\u00a0 drive with ADAS on, the system may have difficulty when driving through construction zones\u201d).\nIt should be\u00a0also noted that for each statement, participants were not informed of the targeted ADAS sub-systems and the names of the sub-systems (e.g., ACC or LCC) were not used in the survey either. Instead, the term \u201cADAS\u201d was used throughout the questionnaire. This is because drivers may not be\u00a0aware of the sub-systems but perceive the ADAS as a single system considering this is how vehicle manufacturers introduce ADAS to consumers. Further, we\u00a0did not classify the limitations into the individual group as some sub-systems share similar limitations, and thus it would be\u00a0arbitrary to assign the limitations to each sub-system (e.g., bad weather can affect both ACC and LCC). For specific statements (23 out of 49), real-world photos or videos of the scenarios were provided to facilitate understanding of the situations. Instead of responding \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019, participants were asked to rate their level of agreement with the statement, ranging from 1 (\u201cstrongly disagree\u201d) to 6 (\u201cstrongly agree\u201d). Participants were further informed that they should choose ratings below or equal to 3 if they tended to disagree and choose ratings above or equal to 4 if they tended to agree. The full list of all statements used to assess drivers\u2019 ADAS mental models is provided in the Appendix, and the relevant photos and videos are provided in the Supplementary materials.\nFor the assessment of drivers\u2019 trust in ADAS, following previous research (DeGuzman and Donmez, 2021a), a five-item scale by Jian et\u00a0al.

Participants were asked to rate their overall agreement with the following five items on a five Likert scale ranging from 1 (\u201cStrongly Disagree\u201d) to 5 (\u201cStrongly Agree\u201d), i.e., \u201cI can trust the ADAS system,\u201d \u201cThe ADAS system is reliable,\u201d \u201cI am\u00a0confident in the ADAS system,\u201d \u201cI am\u00a0familiar with the ADAS system,\u201d and \u201cThe ADAS system is dependable.\u201d This trust assessed by Jian et\u00a0al.

Possible responses for each question in DSQ range from 1 (\u201cvery infrequently or never\u201d) to 6 (\u201cvery frequently or always\u201d). Following previous studies that assessed drivers\u2019 personality (Monteiro et\u00a0al., 2018; Hussain et\u00a0al., 2020; Stinchcombe et\u00a0al., 2023), a ten-item personality measure (TIPI) was used (Gosling et\u00a0 al., 2003), which was a short personality inventory with high reliability and validity for measuring the Big Five personality traits (McCrae and Costa, 2008). Considering that the survey targeted toward Chinese population, a validated Chinese version of TIPI was utilized (Lu et\u00a0 al., 2020), with possible responses ranging from 1 (\u201cstrongly disagree\u201d) to 7 (\u201cstrongly agree\u201d)."

In total, 781 participants filled out the questionnaire. To be\u00a0eligible for the study, participants had to be\u00a0the owner of a vehicle with advanced Level-2 ADAS and had experience using it. Thus, 160 samples were excluded. To screen out potentially unreliable responses and ensure data quality, we\u00a0further adopted the attention check and survey completion time check following previous studies (Rahman et\u00a0al., 2018; Ayoub et\u00a0al., 2021). The attention check was implemented for all participants in our survey by asking a simple math question (e.g., \u201cIf you\u00a0 are reading carefully, please choose the option that matches the result of 6 minus 1\u201d) and the lower threshold of completion time was set to 6 min (50% of the average completion time of 11.8 min). Thus, 268 samples were excluded. Finally, 66 samples with mismatching information were further excluded (e.g., an unreasonable combination of vehicle brand and vehicle model, and ADAS Frequency being higher than Driving Frequency) after manual review. As a result, 287 valid responses from Chinese ADAS users were kept for analyses in this study. The detailed sample demographic information (i.e., age, gender, education, working status, marriage status, household income) is provided in Table\u00a0 1. Respondents of the valid survey sample were compensated with 10 RMB. This study was approved by the Human and Artefacts Research Ethics Committee in HKUST (HREP-2022-0117)."

For each statement, the perfect response was defined as 1 (\u201cstrongly disagree\u201d) if the statement itself is wrong and 6 (\u201cstrongly agree\u201d) if the statement is correct. Inspired by the Manhattan distance, the OMMS of each participant was calculated as follows:\n49\n1\n5 100 5 49 i i\ni\nR P OMMS\n=  \u2212 \u2212 =      \u2211\n(1)\nwhere, Ri is the actual response from the participant for the ith statement; Pi is the perfect answer to the ith statement. Thus, i iR P\u2212 is the distance between the participant\u2019s response and the perfect answer, which can be\u00a0any integer between [0, 5]. Specifically, for a perfect response to a statement, the distance is 0; while for a fully incorrect response, the distance is 5. Therefore, per Equation (1), the possible range for the OMMS is [0, 100].\nIn addition to the OMMS, we\u00a0also calculated the group-based mental model score (gbMMS, ranging from 0 to 100) following the equation below:\n( ) ( )1 5 100 5 length m mn mn m n R P gbMMS length m=  \u2212 \u2212 =     \u2211\n(2)\nwhere, Rmn is the actual response from the participant to the nth statement of the mth group; Pmn is the perfect answer to the nth item of the mth group; length m( ) is the number of statements in the mth group. The possible value for m in this study is 1, 2, 3, and 4, representing ACC-related functions group (gbMMS-ACC), LCC-related functions group (gbMMS-LCC), functions beyond ACC&LCC group (gbMMS-beyond), and ADAS-limitations group (gbMMS-limitation)."

Overall, the analyses in this study include three steps: (1)\nidentify driver groups with different characteristics of ADAS mental model through clustering analysis (highlighted in red); (2) explore predictors of drivers\u2019 mental model through logistic regression model (highlighted in blue); (3) explore predictors of drivers\u2019 trust in ADAS through a mixed linear model (highlighted in green). All analyses were conducted in SAS OnDemand for Academics.\nAs a first step, a cluster analysis using the PROC CLUSTER procedure was conducted based on OMMS and four gbMMS scores. Specifically, Ward\u2019s Hierarchical Clustering method was adopted (Johnson and Wichern, 1992), with the distances between clusters computed using Ward\u2019s minimum-variance method, and the data standardized with the STD option in PROC CLUSTER. The number of clusters was chosen based on the metric of semi-partial R-squared (Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 2009).\nFor Step\u00a02, to explore the predictors of drivers\u2019 ADAS mental model, we\u00a0 fitted a logistic regression model with PROC LOGISTIC. The clusters identified from the previous step were used as the dependent variable. The demographic variables (e.g., age), driving habits-related variables (e.g., driving experience), driving styles, personalities, and their two-way interactions were used as the independent variables in the initial full model. Then a backward stepwise selection method based on Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) (Burnham and Anderson, 2004) was used for model selection.\nFinally, for Step\u00a03, to identify the predictors of drivers\u2019 trust in ADAS, a mixed linear model was fitted using PROC MIXED with the trust in ADAS as the dependent variable. The cluster (i.e., ADAS mental model group) was included in the model as an independent variable. We\u00a0used cluster instead of raw mental model scores as the five mental model scores (OMMS score and 4 gbMMS scores) are highly correlated (e.g., OMMS and gbMMS-ACC: r (285) = 0.74, p < 0.0001; gbMMS-ACC and gbMMS-LCC: r (285) = 0.29, p < 0.0001; gbMMS-ACC and gbMMS-limitation: r (285) = 0.35, p < 0.0001) \u2013 including all of them in the model would cause collinearity issue; while information might be\u00a0lost if we\u00a0include only one of the scores in the model. Further, to avoid potential collinearity issues, all variables that were significant in the logistic regression model in Step\u00a02 were excluded as independent variables in Step\u00a03. The two-way interactions of the independent variables were also included in the initial full model. Similarly, we\u00a0applied the backward stepwise selection method for model selection."

Figure\u00a03 presents the mental scores within each group and Table\u00a0 3 presents the pairwise comparisons of the mental scores between clusters.\nTo further illustrate the characteristics of the clusters, the gbMMS scores were plotted against the OMMS score in Figure\u00a04. Based on the distributions of the mental scores, we\u00a0name the four clusters as follows:\nWeak mental model (WMM) group (i.e., Cluster 3): Drivers in this group has a weak mental model of ADAS in terms of ADASrelated knowledge in general.\nMedium mental model (MMM) group (i.e., Cluster 1): Drivers in this group has a medium level of ADAS-related knowledge in general.\nStrong overall mental model but weak LCC (SMM-W-LCC) group (i.e., Cluster 2): Drivers in this group have a strong mental model of ADAS in general (OMMS). However, although the gbMMS-LCC of this cluster is the second highest among four clusters, the absolute gbMMS-LCC score is much lower than that in cluster 4.\nFurther, this group of drivers also knew well of ADAS limitations. In summary, drivers in this group have a good understanding of ACC and ADAS limitations but a weak mental model of LCC.\nStrong mental model of traditional Level-2 ADAS (SMM-ACC/ LCC) group (i.e., Cluster 4): Drivers in this group have a strong mental model of ADAS in general (OMMS) and know traditional Level-2 ADAS (ACC and LCC) well, though they have relatively weak knowledge of functions beyond ACC & LCC (gbMMS-Beyond). However, it should be\u00a0 noted that all clusters have relatively low gbMMS-Beyond scores and the differences between clusters are small. Thus, this group (Cluster 4) can still be\u00a0 regarded as having the strongest mental model of advanced Level-2 ADAS."

At the same time, every 1-unit increase in emotional stability led to 0.146 units (t(266) = 5.39, p < 0.0001, 95%CI: [0.093, 0.199]) increase in drivers\u2019 trust in ADAS. At the same time, it was found that drivers who encountered ADAS-related accidents trusted less in ADAS compared to drivers without ADAS-related accident history (\u2206 = \u22120.26, 95%CI: [\u22120.48, \u22120.04], t (266) = \u22122.35, p = 0.02). Besides, Tesla owners showed significantly higher trust in ADAS compared to owners of vehicles with other brands (\u2206 = 0.21, 95%CI: [0.08, 0.34], t (266) = 3.10, p = 0.002).\nThe interaction effect between Group and ADAS experience is illustrated in Figure\u00a06, and the corresponding pairwise comparisons are summarized in Tables 6, 7. With more ADAS experience, drivers in the WMM group and SMM-ACC/LCC group tended to have higher trust in ADAS (Figure\u00a06A).

The relatively weak mental model of the functions beyond ACC and LCC is in line with our expectations. First, drivers might be\u00a0less familiar with emerging functions that are only available in the past few years. Second, the capabilities of these emerging functions vary across vehicle brands and even change with time\u2013vehicle manufacturers update vehicle functions Over the Air (OTA), increasing the learning cost of consumers. However, the weak mental model of LCC is beyond our expectations. We\u00a0notice that previous research focusing on drivers\u2019 ADAS mental models did not reveal this significant difference between ACC and LCC (DeGuzman and Donmez, 2021a). A potential explanation is that our study targeted toward a different population compared to those of previous studies. The discrepancies in vehicle culture, traffic rules, advertising strategies, and market shares of these systems may contribute to the difference in mental models. However, it should be\u00a0noted that it would be\u00a0unfair to compare the mental model in our study with the mental model in previous studies directly, as different scoring strategies were adopted.

Thus, it seems to be\u00a0 practically feasible to roughly evaluate drivers\u2019 mental models through a single question. However, further validation through more carefully designed studies is needed before we\u00a0can draw a conclusion.\nFurther, drivers with longer years of licensure were found to be\u00a0more likely to belong to the WMM group compared to the MMM group \u2013 or in other words, to have a weaker ADAS mental model. The years of licensure have been found to be\u00a0correlated with the age of drivers inherently (McCartt et\u00a0al., 2003; Curry et\u00a0al., 2015), which is also the case in our dataset (correlation between age and years of licensure: r (285) = 0.58, p < 0.0001). Thus, the relationship between years of licensure and mental model performance might be\u00a0the effect of age \u2013 those who are younger tend to be\u00a0earlier adopters of new technologies (Lu et\u00a0al., 2009) and thus may have better knowledge of the ADAS system. However, the readers should be\u00a0cautious about this interpretation as other potential covariates might also influence the relationship we\u00a0have observed. For example, it is possible that the driver training program has been changing in the past years, which may lead to a difference in drivers\u2019 understanding of the ADAS. Future research is needed to investigate these relationships with better control of the covariates. Besides, it was found that drivers who drove more mileage (over 300 km/week) tended to have stronger mental models of ADAS compared to those who drive less mileage (less than 99 km/ week). It is possible that those who drove more mileage (over 300 km/ week) tended to use ADAS for long trips and thus they could gain more experience with ADAS. It should be\u00a0noted that, as we\u00a0distributed the survey online, there might be\u00a0professions (e.g., truck drivers) in our respondents. These drivers may drive more but have constructed stronger ADAS mental models through professional training, which may bias our interpretation between driving experience and mental model. Future research with better controlled respondent population or larger sample size is needed to further validate the relationship we\u00a0have observed.\nIn terms of driving style and personality, drivers who had higher planning scores (i.e., tend to plan the trip for an unfamiliar long journey) and with lower agreeableness scores (i.e., tend to be\u00a0more competitive and sometimes even manipulative) were more likely to have strong mental models of ADAS. Previous research found that agreeableness is positively correlated with the adoption of 5G technology (Irfan and Ahmad, 2022). It is possible that those who had higher planning scores and who were more open to technology would prefer to actively seek information regarding ADAS. This finding highlights the importance of providing customized ADAS training to different user groups in order to calibrate their mental model of ADAS."

            "text": "First, it is interesting to notice that drivers\u2019 mental model was associated with users\u2019 trust in ADAS when the users had little experience with ADAS, while the association became weaker after one year of ADAS usage. More specifically, with increased ADAS experience, for drivers with weak or strong mental models, their trust in ADAS showed a generally increasing trend, and drivers in all mental model groups reached a similar level of trust in ADAS after one year of usage. This result echoes the findings in DeGuzman and\nDonmez (2021b) but our findings provide a higher resolution. It seems that when there is little or no experience (i.e., non-owners or new users), drivers\u2019 trust in ADAS is dependent on their knowledge of ADAS; and the trust would gradually increase and become stable after they gained more experience with the ADAS \u2013 this trend of trust is decoupled with the variations in the mental model. The increase in trust with the increase of experience with the system has been widely observed in previous studies (e.g., Beggiato et\u00a0al., 2015). Our results only partially support this conclusion (for drivers who had very strong mental models or very weak mental models) but further indicate that the increase of trust with the accumulation of experience may not be\u00a0the result of increased knowledge in the system. Further studies are needed to explore other factors that can explain the trend of trust in automation with the accumulation of experience.\nFurther, being different from what has been found in DeGuzman and Donmez (2021a), our findings reveal that the relationship between the mental model and initial trust in ADAS (less than 1 month of ADAS experience) is not monotonic. Drivers with a middle level of ADAS knowledge reported the highest trust in ADAS. This might because that in our dataset, drivers with weak mental models are in general with longer years of licensure and are relatively older. Our study, along with some previous research found that age is negatively correlated with trust in technology (Dikmen and Burns, 2017), which may explain the relatively low level of trust in ADAS among drivers with weak ADAS mental model. As for drivers with strong mental models, they might be\u00a0more aware of the system\u2019s limitations compared to those with middle-level mental models and thus they might trust less in ADAS.\nAt the same time, as expected, we\u00a0 found that ADAS-related accidents led to lower trust in ADAS, which is in line with previous studies (Yu et\u00a0al., 2017; Lee et\u00a0al., 2021). It was also found that drivers with higher focus (i.e., higher resistance to driving distraction) and with higher emotional stability (i.e., lower predisposition to psychological stress) would have higher trust in ADAS. The consistency of the driving styles between driving automation and drivers was found to influence drivers\u2019 trust in the driving automation (Ma and Zhang, 2020) and the personality can be\u00a0associated with drivers\u2019 dispositional trust in automation (Hoff and Bashir, 2015), which may explain the associations among driving style, personality, and trust in ADAS observed in our study. However, future research is needed to further explore these relationships. We\u00a0also noticed that drivers of different brands of the vehicle had different levels of trust in ADAS. This might be\u00a0 attributed to different system designs, advertising strategies, and user populations. For example, Tesla has very different in-vehicle human machine interface (HMI) designs compared to vehicles made by traditional manufacturers. Although we\u00a0cannot make comparisons between the HMIs in different vehicles with the data collected in our study, the transparency (Yang et\u00a0al., 2017) and usability of the HMIs (Acemyan and Kortum, 2012) have been widely acknowledged as influential factors of trust in automation. Future research can explore underlying factors that led to the difference among users of different vehicle brands so that targeted strategies to calibrate users\u2019 trust in ADAS can be\u00a0proposed.\nInterestingly, we\u00a0have also observed the difference in drivers\u2019 trust in ADAS across different countries, potentially because of the cultural difference or driver education, which deserves future investigation. Specifically, by comparing our study with other research that used the same measurement for assessing drivers\u2019 trust in ADAS, we\u00a0found that Chinese drivers generally had higher trust (Mean = 4.07, SD = 0.69) in\nFrontiers in Psychology 16 frontiersin.org\nADAS technologies compared to drivers in U.S. (Kidd et\u00a0al., 2017: Mean = 3.67, SD = 0.80) and Canada (DeGuzman and Donmez (2021a): Mean = 3.4, SD = 0.8).\nFinally, it should be\u00a0noted that all our analyses and discussions regarding trust are based on data from a survey study and we\u00a0are not able to observe how trust may affect drivers\u2019 behaviors when using ADAS. Thus, we\u00a0are not able to assess the safety implications of our findings. Future studies may validate our findings in observational or driving simulator studies (Beggiato and Krems, 2013; Beggiato et\u00a0al., 2015; Rossi et\u00a0al., 2020; Zahabi et\u00a0al., 2021; Pai et\u00a0al., 2023). It should also be\u00a0 noted that all the results in this study were based on the population group of Chinese ADAS users. Future research should take potential cultural difference into consideration when interpreting or applying these findings."

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study targeted toward drivers\u2019 mental model of and trust in emerging ADAS technologies beyond ACC and LCC. The findings from this study could be\u00a0summarized as follows:\n\u2022 By clustering drivers\u2019 mental models of individual ADAS functions, only 27 (9%) of respondents can be\u00a0categorized as having a relatively strong mental model of traditional Level-2 ADAS with ACC and LCC. \u2022 Drivers in general had weak knowledge of LCC functions and functions beyond ACC and LCC. \u2022 Years of licensure, weekly driving distance, ADAS familiarity, driving style (i.e., planning), and personability (i.e., agreeableness) were associated with drivers\u2019 mental model of ADAS. \u2022 Mental model levels, vehicle brand, and drivers\u2019 age, ADAS experience, driving style (i.e., focus), and personality (i.e., emotional stability) were significant predictors of drivers\u2019 trust in advanced level-2 ADAS.\nThe findings from this study could provide insights into the design of driver education and training programs. For example, the training programs may put more weights on LCC functions and functions beyond ACC and LCC, given that the user population has weak mental model of it in general. Further, the efforts aiming at calibrating users\u2019 trust in ADAS may focus on more than mental model, but also need to take the characteristics of driver population into consideration, as we\u00a0found that the mental model is not always associated with the variation of trust in ADAS. With more advanced technologies emerging in the field of ADAS, future research may further explore drivers\u2019 usage behaviors of them to enhance more efficient usage of those technologies."
