    "abstractText": "In this paper, the atomic-scale structure fabrication on Si (100) substrate using atomic force microscopy (AFM) with the aid of electrochemical and mechanical processes in a humid environment and under ambient conditions is studied. The local oxidation patterns are formed using platinumcoated tips with the aid of bias applied to the tip-substrate junction, and direct removal has been achieved using single crystal diamond tips, enabling the structure fabrication at the atomic and close-to-atomic scale. The depth and height of the etched trenches reached about 1 nm, which provides an approach for the fabrication of atomic-scale electrodes for molecular device development. Furthermore, material removal close to about three silicon atoms (~3.2 \u00c5) has been achieved. This is important in molecular device fabrication. A detailed comparison among the nanopatterns and the material removal over bare and hydrofluoric acid (HF) treated silicon substrates is provided. This comparison is useful for the application of fabricating atomic-scale electrodes needed for the molecular electronic components. A deep understanding of atomic-scale material removal can be pushed to fabricate a single atomic protrusion by removing the neighbouring atoms so that the molecule can be attached to a single atom, thereby the AFM tip and Si substrate could act as the electrodes and the molecule between them as the channel, providing basic transistor actions in a molecular transistor design. In this paper, platinum-coated and single-crystal diamond tips are used to explain the oxide formations and direct material removal, respectively.",

            "text": "Research on the fabrication of nanochannels using local oxidation and subsequent etching of silicon surfaces have been widely performed [1\u20138]. Even though this approach has been successfully demonstrated, it can hinder the material removal mechanism by forming a deposit over the etched area. Avouris et al. [3] presented that the oxide can be removed by treating it with an aqueous solution of hydrofluoric acid (HF). However, if the oxide layer is removed using the tip itself, direct etching can be made possible without any additional methods. A direct etching method over silicon is made possible without oxide formation by Yamamoto et al. [9], where, they have used a catalytically active platinum-coated atomic force microscope (AFM) probe for material removal. Apart from\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 524. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi13040524 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 524 2 of 14\nthat, methods such as ion-beam sculpting with the application of low- and high-energy ion beams find their relevance in structure fabrication on the atomic scale [10,11]. However, understanding the material removal mechanism is of foremost interest. The conventional mechanisms are well established for micro- and nano-scale manufacturing. On the atomic scale, the material removal could be the result of the combination of different mechanisms such as shearing and extrusion. Material deformations such as ploughing and rubbing could be dominant as well. Usually, during machining, the tip or the machine tool contacts the substrate, and the chips are formed by mechanical shearing [12\u201314]. In the shearing process, due to the compression of the substrate atoms by the tool edge atoms, the substrate atoms are pushed upwards, forming the chips [15]. On the other hand, in extrusion, a plastic deformation is formed beneath the machined surface, and only a few chips will be formed through the extrusion mechanism. The ploughing mechanism is not desirable for machining purposes because it can cause scratches on the machine\u2019s surface, making it less efficient [15]. Even though extrusion is most favored with less chip formation, the actual machining processes at the atomic scale are still not discovered. Molecular dynamic simulations provide a visual understanding of the principles happening at the atomic scale [16\u201319]. Recent studies have shown that the material removal at the atomic scale is mainly caused by the displacement of the substrate atoms [20]. The rake angle, tool edge radius, and the atomistic sizing effects also play major roles [21\u201324]. In order to consistently remove atoms from the topmost layer of material, an atomically precise machining tool should be approached with optimum parameters such as tip force (FT), tip bias, tip velocity (VT), and tip mechanical properties. AFM tips are widely used as the machining tool to understand the fundamentals of structure fabrications at the atomic scale. As silicon is well known for its applications in the semiconductor industry, more precise and consistent material removal should be conducted over it. Apart from that, silicon in its (100) orientation is best suited for the structure fabrication studies as the Si/SiO2 state density is lower than the other orientation, yielding higher carrier mobility when used for nanodevice fabrications. The research gap here is the minimum depth or the heights of atomic patterns that can be achieved to realize structure fabrication using AFMbased electrochemical and mechanical scratching methods using an AFM tip. A removal depth of 1.4 \u00c5 is achieved through mechanochemical methods [25], but the electrochemical and mechanical mechanisms are unknown, which forms the motivation for this study\u2014 with the mechanisms elucidated, it becomes possible to deterministically engineer removal depth. Moreover, the comparison between material removal before and after the oxide layer removal can give a better understanding of the removal mechanism. The influence of the oxide layer is beneficial for fabricating different structures and patterns over the silicon surface. These structures can be used as references for validating the integrated circuit (IC) chip electronic component actions such as the electronic transmission and the conductivity to use these materials as transistors or other devices in their miniaturized versions. Apart from Si, materials such as, highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), gold, silicon carbide and van der Waals materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) are also potential candidates for atomic-scale manufacturing studies using AFM. As a step towards this, in our recently published article, we have shown that a single atomic layer removal over HOPG can be achieved [26]. In this paper, a detailed study on the oxide formation on a silicon surface, with platinum coated tip, while scratching when given a tip bias and the material removal using a diamond tip, using AFM are identified. The differences while using platinum coated and diamond tips over silicon surface is provided, giving information on the structure fabrications in the atomic scale."

When lines were scratched over the bare silicon substrate, under normal room conditions with a humidity of 36%, local anodic oxidation (LAO) occurred. The force with which the lines were drawn is 0.1 \u03bcN. This force is the inimum force used for fabricating nanostructures over silicon substrate using Au-coated and platinum-coated AFM tips [30]. To find an optimized force value with the current set-up, using 7 V tip bias and 1 \u03bcm/s tip velocity, different lines are drawn with different force values ranging from 1 nN to 2 \u03bcN, as shown in Figure 2.

The middle row represents force values from 0.1 \u03bcN t 1 \u03bcN, and th bottom row repr ents the force values from 1.1 \u03bcN to 2 \u03bcN.\nFrom Figure 2, it is clear that the lines are very well distinct and controlled for the force values starting from 0.1 \u03bcN. Apart from that, the LAO happened for the lines with force values as low as 1 nN, and it started to be limited from 0.6 \u03bcN. The lines are faded from 0.6 \u03bcN to 2 \u03bcN. Hence, the upper threshold force value for the LAO to stop is 0.6\u2013 0.7 \u03bcN. With this optimal force, different lines are drawn with different tip voltages and tip velocities. Figure 3 shows a comparison between the effects of oxide formation with low RH (See Figure 3A\u2013C) and high RH (See Figure 3D\u2013F). From the figures, the height and width of all the scratched lines are measured by considering five points within each line, spreading from top to bottom, and the standard deviation is measured to provide the uncertainties in the values. In Figure 3A, it can be seen that the oxidation thickness is higher and wider when the speed is low. At 200 nm/s, the height of the deposit has gone just above 4 nm, and with higher speed, the height is just above 1 nm. This is due to the difference in points of contact between the tip and substrate atoms with varying speeds. With lower speed, more points of contact can be achieved, facilitating the formation of thicker and wider oxides, whereas, with higher speeds, few atoms take part in the oxide formation. A sudden increase in the deposits can be seen from 6 V, and it becomes very much distinct from 7 V. This is because of the increased electric field strength, as shown\n90 n ith an incre ent of 10 n . iddle lines are the forces ranging fro 0.1 \u00b5 to 1 \u00b5 ith an increment of 0.1 \u00b5N. Bottom lines are the forces ranging from 1.1 \u00b5N to 2 \u00b5N with an increment of 0.1 \u00b5N.\nFro Figure 2, it is clear that the lines are very ell distinct and controlled for the force val es starti g fro 0.1 \u00b5 . art fro t at, t e a e e for t e li es it f rce l es s l s , it st rte t e li ite fr . \u00b5 . e li es re f e fr . \u00b5 t 2 \u00b5N. Hence, the upper threshold force value for the LAO to stop is\n.6\u20130.7 \u00b5N. With this optimal force, differe t lines a e dra n with different tip voltages and tip velocities. Figure 3 shows a comparison between th effects of oxide for ati\nfi fi\nr i fro top to bottom, and the standar dev ation is measured to provid the uncer ainties in the values.

This is because of the increased electric field strength, as shown in the earlier works of Cabreta and Mott [31], where the field lowers the activation energy for the ionic species to transfer through the tip-substrate junction.

Furthermore, LAO starts to be clearly visible from 7 V for all the tip velocities. Hence, the formation of oxide deposits has a great influence on VT and the voltage applied, but a threshold voltage of 6\u20137 V is required for the deposits to be seen on the substrate, with a clear and distinct formation at 7 V. This is due to the electric field strength not sufficient enough for the reaction to take place below 6 V.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 14\nin the earlier works of Cabreta and Mott [31], where the field lowers the activation energy for the ionic species to transfer through the tip-substrate junction.

This is due to the electric field strength not sufficient enough for the reaction to take place below 6 V.\nFigure 3.

FT = 0.1 \u03bcN (E) The height vs. tip bias and (F) width vs. tip bias characteristics.\nApart from that, a notable change in the height and width of oxidation, with respect to the decrease in tip velocity, happens after 9 V. This is because of the self-limiting reaction taking place with higher voltage. When the electric field is high, up to 9 V, the oxides are formed with increasing thickness, and this oxide thickness reduces the electric field strength needed for further oxidation and hence reduces the growth rate [1]. With 10 V, the width is almost comparable with different tip velocities. Hence the critical voltage is not strongly affected by the tip velocity after 9 V. This observation could be utilized while performing surface fabrication over silicon. However, when the experiments were performed in the presence of humidity, the LAO behaved differently. The formation of oxides on the surface became consistent and more pronounced than in the ambient air. Figure 3D shows the different lines drawn on the silicon surface with a humidity range of 75\u201390%. From Figure 3E,F, it can be seen that there is a consistent increase in the width and height of the deposits occurring on the surface. The threshold to obtain the deposits were 6\u20137 V under ambient conditions, whereas the deposits start to be clearly visible from as low as 2 V. This indicates that the LAO is largely influenced by the presence of relative humidity. This allows the easy formation of oxides and enhances the formation of a water meniscus at the tip-substrate junction.\nFigure 3.

This is because of the self-limiting reaction taking place with hig er voltage. When the el ctri field is hig , up to 9 V, the oxides are formed with increasing thickness, and this oxide thickness reduces the l ctric field strength needed for further oxidation and hence reduces the growth rate [1]. With 10 V, the width is almost compar ble with differ nt tip velocities. Hence the critical voltage is not strongly affected by the tip velocity after 9 V. This observation could be utilized while performing surface fabrication over silicon. However, when the xperiments were performed in the presence of humidity, the LAO behaved iffer ntly. The formation of oxides on the surface became consi tent and more pronounced than i the ambient air. Figure 3D shows the different lines drawn on the silicon surface with a humidity range of 75\u201390%. From Figure 3E,F, it can be seen that there is a consistent increase in the width an eight of t e deposits occurring on the surface. The threshold to btain the deposits were 6\u20137 V under ambient conditi s, whereas the deposits start to be clearly visible from as low as 2 V. This indicates that the LAO is largely influenced by the presence of relative humidity. This allows the easy formation of oxides and enhances the formation of a water meniscus at the tip-substrate junction. Since a well-defined, consistent and controlled pattern occurred at 7 V potential, 1 \u00b5m/s VT and 0.1 \u00b5N FT, all the experiments are performed by applying a 7 V bias to the tip-substrate junction, the substrate being positive and tip grounded, until and unless\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 524 6 of 14\nmentioned otherwise, a VT of 1 \u00b5m/s and an FT of 0.1 \u00b5N. Hence, 0.1 \u00b5N, 7 V tip bias and 1 \u00b5m/s VT would be best suited for the structure fabrication over the silicon substrate. Some of the letters drawn on the surface under the humid environment, with an RA of 75%, is shown in Figure 4. The letters can be seen well defined and clear with comparable thickness throughout. Hence, to conclude, with platinum-coated conductive tips, LAO occurs, and it is influenced by the tip velocity, tip bias, tip force and humidity conditions. With this, structure fabrication with raised patterns can be achieved, whereas material removal at the atomic scale is not possible directly unless, these substrates are treated with HF acid, which is a time-consuming procedure. Furthermore, as mentioned before, with the catalytically active platinum-coated AFM tip, oxides are not formed, and direct material removal is possible. Here, the oxides are formed because of the absence of any kind of catalyst.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 14\nSince a well-defined, consistent and controlled pattern occurred at 7 V potential, \u03bcm/s VT and 0.1 \u03bcN FT, all the experiments are performed by applying a 7 V bias to the tip-substrate junction, the substrate being positive and tip grounded, until and unless\nentioned other ise, a T of 1 \u03bc /s and an FT of 0.1 \u03bcN.

With Single Crystal Diamond Tip In the above section, oxide deposits were formed over the silicon substrate rather than material removal when platinum-coated tips and applied bias were used. When the tip is replaced with a single crystal diamond, under humidity conditions (~75% and room humidity ~25%) and the same parameters mentioned in the previous section, the results are in favor of material removal. If LAO happened with platinum tips, direct material removal was possible with the diamond tip. Figure 5 shows the contact mode scanned image of silicon in 2 \u00d7 2 \u03bcm area, with a force of 2 \u03bcN. This force is employed since it has been used for implementing nanolithography over hard substrates such as silicon using single crystal diamond tips [32]. The region seems clear with no debris. When a tapping mode scanning of 5 \u00d7 5 \u03bcm area was performed, all dust particles and the oxide deposits can be seen at the boundaries. The line profile shows a depression in the scanned area of approximately 1.89 nm, which ought to be the native oxide layer on the surface that was removed. From the figure, the debris and the dust particles can be seen accumulated on the sides, but it is more pronounced on the right and bottom sides of the scanned area. This happens because of the geometry of the tip used.

In the figure, stable and consistent material removal is obtained for lower voltages till 6 V. With the voltage higher than 6 V, the surface starts to be damaged. Ploughing takes place, and the plastic deformation causes the surface to bulge around the edges of the scratch. However, the dependence of bias over the diamond tip is almost negligible since the depth and height of these lines are not affected by different voltages. The average depth of the seven trenches covered under the line profile is calculated to be 3.98 \u00c5, which is approximately three silicon atoms thick.\nFigure 6.

Side 1 and side 3 causes more materials to be removed from the substrate, whereas side 2 and side 4 causes less removal.
