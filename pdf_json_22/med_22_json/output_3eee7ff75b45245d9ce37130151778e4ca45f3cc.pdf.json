With the development of information technology and the wave of intelligent technology, deep learning has received the attention and attention of scholars. Deep learning advocates learners to actively transfer what they have learned to solve complex problems in reality,\nwhich helps to improve learners\u2019 own critical thinking and knowledge construction. Under the background of educational informatization, due to the support of the Internet and information technology, a variety of teaching tools and teaching resources have emerged that are conducive to teaching construction, an important direction of inquiry in teaching practice. How to use e ective methods to realize deep learning of learners has become one of the research hotspots in the eld of education. e development of Internet technology provides more possibilities for innovation\nHindawi Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience Volume 2022, Article ID 9037010, 13 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/9037010\nin various industries, and network media has become an important medium for information and knowledge dissemination. Teaching is no longer a matter of students being satisfied with the transmission and indoctrination of teachers, but a resonant exchange and knowledge sharing between teachers and students in the classroom. In this context, the traditional indoctrination teaching mode obviously no longer meets the needs of teaching, and it has a certain limiting effect on stimulating learners\u2019 ability to innovate and transfer knowledge. ,e emergence of a series of \u201csmart models\u201d such as smart campuses, smart classrooms, representing new opportunities and challenges for the development of college education. Among them, smart classrooms, as a new teaching model, implement digitalization and personalization in the entire teaching process. Implementing deep learning for learners provides new ideas. Improve the quality of teaching by integrating intelligent data analysis, information sharing, and technology application with the entire teaching process. Information technology has brought strong support for educational reform. With the emergence and development of rain English classrooms, online English learning spaces, and microlecture English resources, the English teaching mode has begun to shift from \u201cteaching-oriented\u201d to \u201clearning-oriented.\u201d In recent years, in order to realize the deep learning of learners, scholars in the field of education continue to carry out teaching practices of various teaching modes. In the development of educational informatization, the application of teaching tools and information technology to improve teaching is an inevitable trend of educational development. Smarter classrooms are more in line with the requirements of the times. Smarter teaching tools are used to better integrate teaching content and teaching methods into classrooms and cultivate students\u2019 higher-order thinking ability. As a new teaching mode, smart classroom provides a new way of inquiry for the realization of deep learning.\nIoT technology can help English learners to learn in a personalized, dynamic, and collaborative manner to solve problems in English learning and to engage in knowledge acquisition and sharing interactively. In addition, the way of learning goes beyond the traditional English classroom, and students can get information from anywhere. In traditional English classrooms, the English teacher is the source of information, learners must stay in the same place and participate in the same activities at the same time, and teaching styles often place students in a passive role. In the smart classroom, students\u2019 access to information is no longer single, and they will not be in a passive state. A smart classroom is not only a physical space to connect objects (smartphones, tablets, RFID tags, etc.), but also a learning environment for learners to learn and solve English learning problems [1\u20138]. From the perspective of the construction of the Internet of ,ings, this research first uses the Internet of ,ings-related acquisition modules to perceive the English classroom environment, designs the acquisition module of the English smart classroom, and then encodes the collected data. ,e data is transmitted to the IoTplatform through the IoTnetwork, and the data is analyzed and processed, so that managers can easily see the collected information."

            "text": "With the development of the Internet and technology, new learning methods are constantly emerging, and smart learning has received more and more attention. ,e environment that learning relies on is more digital. Learning in a smart environment integrates learning activities, textbook materials, and even teachers and classmates. ,ese changes have made users put forward higher requirements for learning experience. ,e learning experience design based on the smart environment demand becomes increasingly important. Research on learning experiences in smart environments has focused on the design of learning experiences [9].\n,e main feature of scholars\u2019 research on smarter classrooms is case evidence. Most of the related researches on smarter classrooms conduct research experiments through actual teaching cases to prove the effect and feasibility of the design.,e original intention of the design is to focus on the all-round development of students and to promote the cultivation of students\u2019 abilities as the core. Kumara and WW and others conducted smart classroom teaching environment experiments for teachers and students and analyzed learners\u2019 experience through questionnaires to verify whether the designed evaluation system can improve the teaching system and promote students\u2019 learning. Lee et al. proposed that, with the development of information technology, it is necessary to be good at applying technology, integrate technology andmethods to form smart classrooms, and make smart classrooms specific and sustainable. Lui and Slotta applied designed experiential immersion learning activities to simulation experiments in biology. Using technology to display all aspects and enhance the experience and perception, through this experiment of teaching cooperation, the students participating in this course have formed a complete system of understanding of biological disciplines. Jena conducted an investigation and research on the learning situation of the smarter classroom, taking Indian primary school students as the research object, and came to the conclusion through the analysis and summary of the scores that the smarter classroom hasmore advantages in teaching strategies, teachers\u2019 roles, and the use of teaching aids. Kumara and others believe that the development of technology provides more possibilities for human-computer interaction, and the integration of somatosensory technology and classroom teaching reflects its advantages. Students gain a sense of pleasure through efficient human-computer interaction, and the proposed evaluation system is verified through questionnaires. It has positive significance for the development of smart classroom learning [10, 11].\nTo sum up, the integration and development of the Internet and education have accelerated the construction of smart teaching, using the information technology means of the new era to push the concept and method of blended teaching to a wider range and promote the cutting-edge information technology (such as cloud computing, Mobile Internet, data mining, etc.) integrated into teaching scenarios and committed to providing data-based and intelligent information support for all teaching processes."

            "text": "English teaching terminal relies on the Internet of ,ings platform and adopts the relevant modules of the Internet of ,ings to design. ,e data collected by the terminal will be uploaded to the English teaching management platform through the Internet of ,ings communication module, and the English teaching management platform will process the data in real time and display it on the page; the administrator can understand the situation of the classroom accurately in real time, which brings convenience to the management of the classroom. ,e monitoring terminal designed in this study mainly collects the campus card information of the students in the classroom, the location of the classroom, and the status of the equipment, then encodes the collected data, and transmits the collected information to the English teaching management through the NB-IoT network platform and processes data in real time. As shown in Figure 2, the main function of the power module is to provide stable voltage to other modules. Since the monitoring terminal needs to work for a long time, in order to make the terminal run stably, the selection of the power module is particularly important. ,e acquisition module has two basic functions in design: the acquisition module will receive the command data from the main control module, and according to the instructions of the main control module, the corresponding acquisition unit (RFID module or positioning module) will be assigned to work for data acquisition. ,e module converts the collected parameter data into processable electronic information and sends it to the main control module for processing. ,e main control module encodes the collected data and sends the data to the English teaching\nmanagement platform by calling the communication module. In the whole monitoring terminal, the main control module is at the core position. First, it controls the acquisition module and sends acquisition commands to the acquisition module for data acquisition. ,e second is to encode the data collected by the acquisition module according to the specified communication protocol and finally control the NB-IoT communication module to send the encoded data to the server, and the server analyzes the data in real time to realize real-time monitoring by the monitoring terminal [15\u201318]. ,e main function of the communication module is to monitor the data communication between the terminal and the English teaching management platform, to send data to the English teaching management platform and to receive data from the English teaching management platform. ,e configuration function of the monitoring terminal can be realized.\n3.1.2. 'e Overall Design of the English Teaching Management Platform. A properly designed English teaching management platform can fully tap the internal connection between the data. ,e function of the English teaching management platform is mainly to analyze and display the data uploaded by the monitoring terminal, and the administrator can easily monitor the collected data. In order to facilitate the management of the monitoring terminal and the reporting of the classroom location, the system will configure the monitoring terminal so that the terminal can report the location to the English teaching management platform in real time. Figure 3 is the basic workflow of the English teaching management platform. It can be seen that the English teaching management platform receives the data uploaded from the acquisition device and extracts the data\naccording to the agreed protocol format. First, the location data of the device is extracted, and the map module is called to locate the device. ,en extract the flag bit of the acquisition device. ,e flag bit is mainly divided into two states: the state where the flag bit is 0 indicates that the monitoring terminal is currently working normally, and each module of the device is operating normally according to the settings. ,e data is stored in the database and then the data analysis module is called to process the data; if the flag bit is not 0, this state indicates that there is an abnormal situation in the acquisition equipment, and the platform will notify the management personnel of the abnormal information in time, thereby reminding the management personnel to take care of the abnormality and deal with it accordingly. Not only can the English teaching management platform analyze and process the uploaded data, but managers with\ncorresponding management authority can also set parameters for monitoring equipment, such as the collection range of monitoring equipment, data collection cycle, and other instructions. After the parameters are configured, the English teaching management platform will issue a configuration instruction, the communication module will transmit the received data to the main control module, and the main control module will execute the instructions to configure the terminal and will automatically communicate with the English teaching management platform after the terminal has updated the configuration [19, 20].\n3.2. Key Technologies of NB-IoT. NB-IoT is a wireless access technology that is standardized in 3GPP and has excellent performance to support IoT devices. IoT technology has\ngood application prospects in many fields, such as security, asset tracking, remote monitoring, metering (gas, water and electricity, etc.), and smart grids.,is enables the superiority of the Internet of ,ings to be reflected. Features such as large connections and low cost will support communications in these fields. ,e currently widely used 2G/3G/4G/5G communication technologies cannot fully meet this demand. ,e structure design of smart classroom can be divided into the following three levels, as shown in Figure 4 [21].\n,e structure design of the smart classroom is designed according to the design mode of the Internet of ,ings: the bottom perception layer is responsible for sensing external information, such as the collection of external information by various sensors; the middle network layer is responsible for information transmission. ,e layer processes the data information passed by the network layer. ,ese three-layer structures cooperate with each other to enable the IoT to operate stably. ,e following are the specific functions of each layer.\n3.2.1. Perception Layer. ,e task of the bottom perception layer is to collect information. ,e design of this research is mainly to collect the campus card information and the latitude and longitude information of the terminal.\n3.2.2. Network Layer. ,e network layer plays the role of data handling. It mainly uses wireless transmission to transmit the data information collected by the perception layer through the network layer, so as to realize multichannel data transmission and forwarding. ,e smart classroom communication technology chooses NB-IoT technology, which is more suitable for IoTcommunication because of its low cost and high security.\n3.2.3. Application Layer. ,e top-level application layer is at the core of the three-layer architecture. ,e application layer analyzes and processes the data sent by the network layer, saves the processing results in the database, and can generate a visual interface according to requirements.\nNB-IoT technology is developed from 4G LTE/evolved packet core network (EPC). NB-IoT technology has many advantages that other communication technologies do not have, such as high coverage, low power consumption, etc. ,is technology optimizes the 4G network architecture to a certain extent. ,ere are the following two transmission optimization schemes: (1) Control plane optimization transmission scheme: ,is scheme performs IP data transmission between the terminal and MME (Mobility Management Entity). ,e signaling bearer mechanism is used in the network, and the nonaccess bearer provides a security mechanism. (2) User plane optimization transmission scheme:,is scheme mainly optimizes the signaling transmission process, so that the terminal can also store the connection in the idle state. ,e context information of the bearer is entered, and the wireless connection and the core network connection can be quickly reestablished for data\ntransmission in an idle state. ,e overall architecture of NBIoT is shown in Figure 5."

Its small size meets the small size requirements of the system design. At the same time, the packaging of BC95 is not difficult. LCC packaging method can be used, and SMT equipment can be used to achieve mass production, which can meet a large number of configurations of monitoring terminals. In order to enable the BC95 module to cope with various complex environments, the use of SMT, a difficult patch technology, enables the module to have good performance and high reliability.\nBy Figure 7, it can be seen that the BC95 module provides a large number of interfaces on the outside and also provides two data storage units, Flash and SRAM, inside the module. Data can be stored here, which can effectively prevent data loss. ,e module also supports an external USIM card to transmit data through the network provided by the USIM card. ,ere is an external interface for the SPI communication module for data transmission, which is convenient for data transmission. ,e network frequency bands supported by the module are rich, and the sending and receiving modes of Band5, Band8, Band20, and Band28 are supported [23, 24]."

It can be directly connected to the development board by using a triode. ,e pin can detect whether the communication module is registered to the network, and the light-emitting state of the diode can be observed by connecting a triode to the light-emitting diode. ,e switch state of the light represents whether the module can be successfully registered to the network, as shown in Table 1.\nPins 29 and 30 are connected to the development board and are responsible for data transmission between the communication module and the development board.

Hardware Design of the Positioning Module. In this research design, the location of the monitoring terminal is also required to be located; the purpose is to be able to understand the distribution of the terminal and to find the equipment in time when the terminal equipment fails to reduce equipment maintenance costs. Since the monitoring equipment is distributed in all corners of the classroom, the positioning accuracy of the positioning module is required to be high. Selecting a suitable positioning module will be beneficial to the analysis of the data of the English teaching management platform and the maintenance of the equipment by the managers. At present, it can receive satellite signals of Beidou B1 frequency band and GPS frequency band and monitor the real-time location through the location acquisition of the positioning module.\n4.3.1. Selection of the PositioningModule. In order to achieve equipment positioning in indoor conditions, this study also has certain requirements for the power supply voltage of the module.,e following is the parameter comparison between various module models.\nBy Table 2, it can be seen that the NEO-M8N positioning module has higher positioning accuracy than other models, and the smaller size of the module meets the requirements of the monitoring terminal module selection.

In the process of testing the RFID module, the card reading operation is performed, and the data shows that the student information has changed. ,rough the movement of the data acquisition module, it can be observed that the position information transmitted by the serial port has changed, and its flag bit has also changed accordingly.\n5.1.2. Network Communication Function Test. Since the NBIoTmodule needs to configure the selection parameters of the working mode before use, the CoAP mode is selected as the data transmission mode in the working mode, and the other transmission modes include the transparent transmission mode and the UDC mode. CoAP mode is a lightweight protocol that is very suitable for this small IoT terminal. ,e parameters of CoAP mode can be configured using AT commands. ,e main AT commands are shown in Table 4.\n,e working mode can be configured through AT+WKMOD, for example: AT+WKMOD\ufffdUDC means to switch the working mode to UDC mode, and similarly, it can also be switched to CoAP mode.\nBefore testing whether the communication module can successfully connect to the network, it is necessary to install the SIM card and connect the antenna.
