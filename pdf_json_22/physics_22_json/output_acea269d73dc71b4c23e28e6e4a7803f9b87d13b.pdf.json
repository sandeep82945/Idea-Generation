            "text": "Shape memory refers to the phenomenon when a material is mechanically deformed and subsequently reverses the deformation upon a change of temperature. Aer its rst discovery in 1951, the shape-memory effect attracted substantial attention on account of its considerable scientic and technological signicance.1,2 To date, Ni\u2013Ti alloys are the most commonly used shape-memory alloys in science and engineering.3 Since the 1980s, the relatively new class of polymeric shape-recovery materials has attracted increasing attention.4\u20138 Many shapememory materials are already in practical use in surgical procedures, mechanical engineering, and clothing, and more are expected to nd applications in aerospace engineering and\nhool of Engineering Hokkaido University, l: hajito@eng.hokudai.ac.jp nce, Shizuoka University, Shizuoka 422- ka.ac.jp , Graduate School of Nanobioscience, nazawa-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 236- c.jp and Discovery (WPI-ICReDD) Hokkaido pan\n(ESI) available: X-ray crystallographic al data, emission spectra and other 2081352.

However, despite signicant advances in this area, it remains difficult to impart known shape-memory materials with additional functionalities; for example, multi-stage and anisotropic shape changes,12\u201324 as well as changes in light absorbance and emission to accompany the shape change remain elusive.25\u201328 This is due to the fact that the shape-memory properties of metal alloys and polymers strongly depend on their components or chemical structures, and that it is difficult to alter their atomic or molecular structure while retaining the shapememory-type effect.\nDynamic molecular crystals that are responsive to external stimuli have drawn increasing attention in recent years. Upon applying external stimuli, these dynamic molecular crystals show macroscopic dynamic effects such as bending, jumping, crawling, or creeping.29\u201333 In 2016, the groups of Naumov34 and Takamizawa35 almost simultaneously reported the rst examples of organic molecular crystals with shape-memory-type phenomena (Fig. 1) These crystals can be bent mechanically, resulting in a stress-induced martensitic transformation. Upon heating, the deformed crystals regain its straight shape. The mechanism of the shape-memory-type phenomena can be expected to be different from those reported for metal alloys and polymers, and we observed similar \u201cshape-deformation and\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

These ndings suggest that the variety of shape-memory-type materials, which had previously been limited to metal alloys and polymers, could be broadened signicantly. In addition, the characteristics of organic crystals could enable functionalities that are unprecedented in conventional shape-memory materials, such as anisotropic or multiple shape changes12\u201324 and optical-property changes.25\u201328,36\u201351\nWe have previously reported gold(I) complexes with ferroelastic properties, whose crystal shape can be deformed by an applied force, which induces twinning.52 The gold(I) crystals show luminescence under UV light. Although they are not temperature-responsive, we anticipated that it should be possible to develop a crystalline compound that exhibits both temperature-dependent, reversible crystal-phase changes and ferroelasticity as well as changes to its crystal shape and luminescence. Herein, we report molecular crystals of an arylgold(I) (N-heterocyclic carbene) (NHC) complex with a reversible multistage shape-changing effect aer mechanical deformation. This material is able to remember at least three different shapes. These shapes can be reproduced in a cyclic fashion among different shapes upon changing the temperature even aer the crystal has regained its straight shape.\nThe reversible multi-stage shape-changing effect was achieved by a combined process involving twinning deformation and multi-step thermal phase transitions among three phases, i.e., a low temperature (LT), room temperature (RT), and high temperature (HT) phase. Ferroelastic behavior,35,52\u201366 i.e., mechanical-stress-induced twinning deformation with\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

Under an applied force, the RT crystal undergoes mechanical bending with a zigzag morphology. Upon cooling, the bent RT (b-RT) transforms into a bent LT (b-LT) with an enhanced zigzag morphology (Fig. 1c). Intriguingly, this shape change is reversible upon heating b-LT, the zigzag morphology of b-RT is recovered, which conrms reversible multi-stage shapechanging effect (Fig. 1c). However, when b-RT is heated to give straight HT (s-HT), the zigzag morphology is lost, and the bent crystal regain its straight shape (Fig. 1c). Surprisingly, aer \u2018memorizing\u2019 the bent shape, the crystals exhibit temperatureinduced reversible shape changes even aer transformation to the unbent s-HT phase. The zigzag-shaped b-RT was recovered upon cooling straight s-HT (Fig. 1c). This full reversibility is able to vary among distinct shapes without external force by simply changing in temperature. Interestingly, the transformations among the three shapes are accompanied by changes of the luminescence color. To the best of our knowledge, such reversible multi-stage shape-changing materials with luminescence-color changes have not yet been reported. Based on XRD, spectroscopic, and thermal analyses, as well as mechanical-property measurements, we will discuss the origin of this unique stimulus-responsivity."

            "text": "Complex 1 was prepared according to our previously reported procedure.52 Typically, pristine crystals of 1, hereaer referred to as RT, are colorless parallelogram plates with corner angles of 74 (Fig. 2c and d and S1\u2020). The RT crystals show weak yellow photoluminescence under UV light.\nCrystals of 1 exhibit simultaneous changes of their luminescence and morphology in response to temperature changes. Upon cooling to 170 K, the emission intensity of RT gradually increased (Fig. 2d(ii)). Upon further cooling to 160 K, the crystal shape begins to change, and several ordered crystalline domains with pale yellow-green emission appear (Fig. 2d(iii)). Upon further cooling to 93 K, the pale yellow-green-emitting domains gradually expand, accompanied by a prominent morphological change (Fig. 2d(iv)). Eventually, a more oblique parallelogram crystal with corner angles of 60 is obtained. The resulting yellow-green emissive crystal will henceforth be referred to as LT. Both the changes in emission color and shape between the LT and RT crystals are reversible upon changing the temperature: upon heating LT, RT is recovered at 273 K (Fig. 2d(vi)). Upon further heating of RT, gradual macroscopic morphological changes are observed starting at 360 K. At 373 K, a rectangular crystal (hereaer: HT) is obtained (Fig. 2d(viii)). The conversion of RT to HT also leads to an emission-color change: HT shows weak green photoluminescence. The photoluminescence intensity enhances upon cooling to 303 K (Fig. 2d(ix)). Recovery of the emission color and shape due to the phase transition from HT to RT was conrmed at 293 K (Fig. S1 and S2\u2020). The entire sequence can be seen in the ESI (Movie S1\u2020). The reversible shape deformation among LT, RT, and HT was performed for at least 16 heating/cooling cycles without visible cracking of the crystals\nChem.

A differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis conrmed the reversibility of the transitions among the three phases (RT to LT: 191 K; LT to RT: 237 K; RT toHT: 324 K;HT to RT: 296 K; Fig. 2b and S4\u2020). These observations conrm that crystals of 1 show reversible changes of their emission color and macroscopic morphology upon cooling/heating.\nThe photophysical properties of the LT, RT, and HT crystals were also investigated. As RT exhibits strong yellow photoluminescence upon moderate cooling (Fig. 2d(ii)), its emission spectrum was measured at 193 K. Under UV light, RT exhibited an emission spectrum with a maximum at 581 nm (Fig. 2e and S5\u2020). The emission spectrum of LT at 93 K showed a maximum at 544 nm, indicating a hypsochromic shi of the emission band upon cooling (Fig. 2e and S5\u2020). Similar to that of RT, the\n9546 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 9544\u20139551\nemission spectrum of HT at 373 K is broad. However, its maximum emission wavelength (510 nm) is shorter than those of RT and LT (Fig. 2e and S5\u2020). We also conrmed that the RT crystal recovered from LT or HT showed an emission spectrum similar to that of pristine RT (Fig. S5\u2020), indicating that the photophysical properties are reversible.\nSingle-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses demonstrated that the LT, RT, and HT crystal structures differ from one another. The single-crystal diffraction analysis of LT was performed at 123 K and indicated that LT crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c at this temperature (Table S2\u2020). In LT, the molecules of 1 adopt a at conformation with a dihedral angle (q) of 2.5789(2) between the NHC ring and the halogenated benzene ring on the gold atom (Fig. 3b and S9\u2020). These at molecules form dimers with a head-to-tail arrangement through p\u2013p stacking interactions between the NHC ring and the benzene ring (heterogeneous stacking) with a longitudinal offset (Fig. S9\u2020). The dimers interact with adjacent dimers through p\u2013p stacking interactions between the NHC rings or benzene rings (homogeneous stacking), allowing the formation of a zigzag stacking motif. To investigate the crystal structure of RT, an XRD analysis of the same piece of the crystal was then performed at 293 K. Importantly, RT exhibits a crystal structure different from that of LT, i.e., RT crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c (Table S2\u2020). In RT, the molecules also adopt at conformations (q \u00bc 4.1(3) or 0.2(3) ; Fig. 3b and S10\u2020). These at molecules form p\u2013p stacking interactions with a head-to-tail arrangement. Stacks of four molecules (tetramer units) interact with adjacent tetramers through homogeneous p\u2013p stacking between NHC rings or benzene rings along the crystallographic a-axis. For the analysis of HT, XRD measurements of the same piece of the crystal were performed at 363 K. HT showed a symmetry change from a monoclinic to an orthorhombic system with the space group Pnma (Table S2\u2020).\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

No homogeneous p\u2013p stacking interactions were observed in HT, indicating that the stacking motif lacks an offset. In their entirety, these results suggest that the LT, RT, and HT crystal structures all involve molecular stacking of molecules with at conformations. However, the motifs of the molecular stacking differ, which could be the origin of the stimulus-responsivity.\nRemarkably, the macroscopic corner angles of the crystals of LT, RT, and HT are correlated to the microscopic offset angle of their molecular stacking. In LT, molecules stack with a longitudinal displacement along the molecular long axis (Fig. 3b) with an overall offset angle of 59.4 , which coincides with the 59 corner angle of its macroscopic crystal (Fig. 3a and b). In RT, the overall offset angle of molecular stacking is 73.4 , which is in good agreement with the macroscopic corner angle of its crystal (73 ; Fig. 3a and b). For HT, the molecules stack without longitudinal displacement along the long molecular axis, producing an offset angle of 90.0 , which also coincides with the corner angle of its rectangular crystal (90 ; Fig. 3a and b). Moreover, the results of the face-indexing experiments support the correspondence between the corner and offset angles (Fig. 3c and S12\u2020). These detailed analyses of the crystal structures of 1 thus claried the origin of their macroscopic morphology changes.\nSubsequently, we examined the mechanical properties of the RT crystal at room temperature. For that purpose, the crystal was mechanically bent by applying shear stress to its (100) face (Fig. 4a(i and ii) and Movie S2\u2020). Even aer removing the mechanical stress, the bent shape was retained, conrming that it exhibited plastic bending. The bending angle of the bent RT (b-RT) is 32 , and the reproducibility of the bending angle was conrmed (Fig. S13\u2020). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation of b-RT showed a clear bending interface at the boundaries between the bent and unbent regions (Fig. 4b and S14\u2020). Upon applying shear stress in the opposite direction, the bent region of RT was completely restored to its original parallelogram shape (Fig. 4a(iii and iv)). These reversible mechanical deformations are similar to those of the ferroelastic molecular crystals that we have previously reported for a structurally similar gold complex.52\nA single-crystal XRD analysis of b-RT was performed at 293 K and demonstrated a twinning deformation composed of an unbent domain (a0) and a bent domain (a1), which indicates that the crystal structures of the a0 and a1 domains are identical but oriented differently. According to the crystal-face indexing, the a0 and a1 domains are connected via the interface (00 1)a0// (00 1)a1 (Fig. 4c). The lattices of the mother and daughter phase are related by a 180 rotation along the rotational axis (arrow in Fig. 4c and d). The microscopic bending angle between a0 and a1 predicted from these twinning analyses is 33.2 (Fig. 4d), which agrees well with the macroscopic bending angle (32 ) conrmed by optical microscopy images (Fig. 4a). The packing diagram shows that a molecular rotation of 33.2 is required to retain continuous boundaries between the a0 and the a1 domain during the deformation (Fig. 4d). Overall, the\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nXRD results demonstrate that macroscopic and microscopic changes occur upon the twinning deformation from the a0 to the a1 domain. The stress\u2013strain relationship during the ferroelastic deformation of the RT crystal was investigated at 303 K. Upon increasing the shear stress on the (100) plane of the RT, the a1 domain was generated at the jig side at 0.16 MPa (Fig. 4e and f(i and ii) and Movie S3\u2020). The a1 domain grew upon applying further, relatively constant shear stress. The a1 domain expanded until another a1 domain was generated at a shear stress of 0.29 MPa(III). The second a1 domain then expanded under almost-constant stress. Aer removing the stress, these two a1 domains remained and the generation of spontaneous strain was observed (iv). Moreover, upon applying shear stress\nChem. Sci., 2022, 13, 9544\u20139551 | 9547\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The second a1 domain began to contract when the stress reached 0.12 MPa. Aer the second a1 domain disappeared, the a1 domain close to the jig started to contract at 0.21 MPa (v). Subsequently, the last a1 domain disappeared and the bent b-RT was restored to its original straight shape. The forward (0.16 MPa) and reverse (0.12 MPa) critical stress of RT are lower than those in our previous report (0.61 MPa and 0.49, respectively),52 indicating that RT is superior in terms of absorbing weak mechanical shocks. The stress\u2013strain measurement of the RT crystal demonstrates typical ferroelastic behavior, including hysteresis behavior and the build-up of spontaneous strain.\nWe then investigated the reversible multi-stage shapechanging effect of crystal 1. First, the bent shape was \u2018memorized\u2019 in the pristine RT crystal by mechanical bending to give bRT (Fig. 5a). Upon cooling b-RT for the transition to LT, the bending angle increases remarkably from 32 to 61 (photographs B and C in Fig. 5a and Movie S4\u2020), whereby b-LT shows a more pronounced zigzag shape than b-RT. The corner angle of\nFig. 5 Reversiblemulti-stage shape-changing effect andmechanism of c is mechanically bent (A and B).

The m crystals of b-LT, b-RT, and s-HT correspond to their macroscopic bend\n9548 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 9544\u20139551\nthe b-LT crystal is 60 , which is similar to that of LT. Upon reheating b-LT to induce the phase transition to b-RT, the bending angle again changed from 61 to 32 at 235 K (photographs C and D in Fig. 5a), i.e., the bent shape of b-RT was restored by heating. Upon further heating b-RT to 330 K , the bend completely disappeared via phase transition to the HT phase to give straight-shaped s-HT (Fig. 5a(E)). Although HT (Fig. 2d) and s-HT (Fig. 5a) have almost the same morphology and s-HT presented no obvious damage, remarkably, s-HT can reproduce the zig-zag shape; upon cooling to room temperature, the crystal again bent with an angle of 32 (Fig. 5a(F)). This indicates that the \u2018memorized\u2019 b-RT shape (Fig. 5a(F)) was recovered from s-HT (Fig. 5a(E)) without applying additional mechanical stress. As mentioned above, HT can be obtained by heating pristine unbent RT; the resulting HT crystal did not undergo bending upon cooling (Fig. S1 and S2\u2020). The b-LT and s-HT shapes could also be reproduced via phase transition upon cooling or heating, respectively. As expected, the morphology changes of the bent crystals of 1 upon cooling/heating were accompanied by emission-color changes (photographs O\u2013R in\nrystal 1.

And the reproducibility of the reversible multi-stage shape changing effect was conrmed (Fig. S18 and S19\u2020). These results indicate that the pristine crystal of 1 can take on three different shapes, b-LT, b-RT, and s-HT, which exhibit a reversible multi-stage shape-changing effect upon cyclic cooling and heating.\nDetailed XRD analyses were carried out to explain the mechanism of the shape memorization and reproduction. Similar to that of b-RT, the observed bending angles of b-LT and s-HT can be reasonably interpreted in terms of their XRD results. An XRD analysis of b-LT was performed at 123 K, and its crystal structure was found to be twinned (Table S3\u2020). Both the a0 and a1 domains have crystal structures that are identical to that of the LT crystal and the interface between the a0 and a1 domains is ( 100)a0//( 100)a1 (Fig. S20\u2020). The lattices of the a1 domain are obtained from a 180 rotation around the rotational axis, which is indicated by the arrow parallel to the twinning interface ( 100). Its microscopic bending angle was estimated to be 61.2 , which coincides with the macroscopic bending angle of 61 conrmed by optical microscopy (Fig. 5 and S18\u2020). For s-HT, twinning was not observed, and it could thus be modeled as a single component (Table S3 and Fig. S21\u2020). As the offset angle of the molecular stack of s-HT is 90.0 , its microscopic bending angle is estimated to be 0 . This causes the straight shape of s-HT, whereby the zigzag shape caused by the twinning in b-RT and b-LT disappears (Fig. 5a and b). As mentioned above, SEM images of b-RT show bending interfaces at the boundaries between the bent and unbent regions (Fig. 4b). The traces of these bending interfaces remained even aer b-RT transformed into s-HT (Fig. S22\u2020). Although the interface seems to disappear via optical observation, the retained post-bending interface in s-HT can be expected to be important for the recovery of the b-RT shape. In contrast, HT, which was obtained starting from unbent RT, showed a clear surface, and no traces were found on s-HT surface via SEM (Fig. S23\u2020). Upon cooling HT to room temperature, it does not bend (Fig. S2\u2020). The macroscopic bending angles of b-LT, b-RT, and s-HT can thus be reasonably rationalized based on their crystal structures. The key to the present reversible multi-stage shape-changing effect in the crystal of complex 1 is that 1 shows both multiple temperature-dependent phase changes (HT, RT,\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nand LT) and mechanical deformation with ferroelasticity (Fig. 6). Moreover, crystals of 1 show simultaneously changes in morphology and luminescence color in response to temperature changes. The crystal of 1 can be mechanically bent by application of stress at room temperature (RT), and subsequently undergo a reversible multi-stage shape-changing effect upon cooling/heating (s-HT, b-RT, and b-LT)."

            "text": "We have reported a reversible multi-stage shape-changing material based on an arylgold(I) (N-heterocyclic carbene) (NHC) complex (1) that is characterized by the reproduction of three different shapes and luminescence-color changes (Fig. 6). The reversible multi-stage shape-changing effect is achieved by a combination of twinning deformation and multi-step thermal phase transitions. The twinning deformation causes lattice rotation in a crystal of 1 at room temperature (RT), resulting in a zigzag shape (b-RT) with different orientations of the crystal structures. When RT is mechanically bent, the bending direction of the crystal structure is memorized. Intriguingly, the interconversion among the three different shapes is accompanied by changes of the luminescence color. The discovery of this reversible multi-stage shape-changing material can be expected to result in novel strategies for imparting known shape-memory materials with additional functionalities."
