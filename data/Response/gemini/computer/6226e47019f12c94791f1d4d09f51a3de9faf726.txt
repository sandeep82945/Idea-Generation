1. **Investigate the impact of different beamforming techniques on the interference power and achievable rate of the NU.** The paper assumes analog-only beamforming for both the NU and FU, but other beamforming techniques, such as digital beamforming or hybrid beamforming, could be used to further reduce the interference. It would be interesting to study how these different beamforming techniques affect the performance of the system.


2. **Extend the analysis to the case where the NU and FU are both located in the far-field region.** The paper focuses on the case where the NU is located in the near-field region and the FU is located in the far-field region. However, it would be interesting to extend the analysis to the case where both the NU and FU are located in the far-field region. This would require a different channel model and different expressions for the interference power and achievable rate.


3. **Consider the effects of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation.** The paper assumes that the propagation between the BS and the NU and FU is line-of-sight (LOS). However, in practice, there may be obstacles between the BS and the users, which can cause NLOS propagation. It would be interesting to study how NLOS propagation affects the performance of the system.


4. **Investigate the use of multiple BSs to serve the NU and FU.** The paper considers a single-cell scenario with a single BS serving the NU and FU. However, in practice, there may be multiple BSs available to serve the users. It would be interesting to study how the use of multiple BSs can improve the performance of the system.


5. **Develop new resource allocation algorithms for the mixed near- and far-field communication scenario.** The paper does not consider resource allocation for the mixed near- and far-field communication scenario. It would be interesting to develop new resource allocation algorithms that can optimize the performance of the system. These algorithms could take into account factors such as the interference power, the achievable rate, and the fairness between the NU and FU.
