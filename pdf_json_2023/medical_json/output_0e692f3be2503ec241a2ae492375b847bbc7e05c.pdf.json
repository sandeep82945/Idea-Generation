McCarthy 1,2* 1Program in Neuroscience, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States, 2Department of Pharmacology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States\nSocial play is a dynamic and rewarding behavior abundantly expressed by\nmost mammals during the juvenile period. While its exact function is debated,\nvarious rodent studies on the effects of juvenile social isolation suggest that\nparticipating in play is essential to appropriate behavior and reproductive\nsuccess in adulthood. However, the vast majority of these studies were\nconducted in one sex only, a critical concern given the fact that there are\nknown sex differences in play\u2019s expression: across nearly all species that\nplay, males play more frequently and intensely than females, and there are\nqualitative sex differences in play patterns. Further limiting our understanding\nof the importance of play is the use of total isolation to prevent interactions\nwith other juveniles. Here, we employed a novel cage design to specifically\nprevent play in rats while allowing for other forms of social interaction. We find\nthat play deprivation during the juvenile period results in enduring sex-specific\neffects on later-life behavior, primarily in males. Males prevented from\nplaying as juveniles exhibited decreased sexual behavior, hypersociability, and\nincreased aggressiveness in adulthood, with no effects on these measures in\nfemales. Importantly, play deprivation had no effect on anxiety-like behavior,\nobject memory, sex preference, or social recognition in either sex, showing\nthe specificity of the identified impairments, though there were overall sex\ndifferences in many of these measures. Additionally, acute play deprivation\nimpaired performance on a test of prosocial behavior in both sexes, indicating\na difference in the motivation and/or ability to acquire this empathy-driven\ntask. Together, these findings provide novel insight into the importance and\nfunction of juvenile social play and how this differs in males and females.\nKEYWORDS\nbehavior, social play, play, social isolation, social behavior, sex differences\nFrontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience 01 frontiersin.org\nMarquardt et al. 10.3389/fnbeh.2022.1076765"

            "text": "Broadly seen in most mammalian species from rodents to humans, social play (also known as rough-and-tumble play or play-fighting) has fascinated neuroscientists and evolutionary biologists alike for decades. Though animals spend upwards of 20% of their time participating in play during adolescence (Pellis and Pellis, 2009), this well-conserved behavior serves no obvious purpose, yet appears fundamental for appropriate development. Various studies have found that juvenile social isolation in rats leads to impairments in social behavior (Hol et al., 1999; Van den Berg et al., 1999; Von Frijtag et al., 2002), cognition (Einon et al., 1978; Baarendse et al., 2013; Yusufishaq and Rosenkranz, 2013), and sexual behavior (Gerall et al., 1967; Cooke et al., 2000), increases anxiety- and depression-like behavior (Parker and Morinan, 1986; Wright et al., 1991; Arakawa, 2003; Leussis and Andersen, 2008; Lukkes et al., 2009; Cuesta et al., 2020), and impacts susceptibility to addiction-related behaviors (Whitaker et al., 2013; Baarendse et al., 2014).\nWhile these studies provide insight on the impacts of juvenile social isolation writ large, there are three important caveats that preclude the ability to apply them to assess the importance of social play specifically. First, isolation prevents all social interaction\u2014both play and non-play\u2014so it is unclear in most of these studies whether and to what extent any identified impairments are due to the lack of play vs. the lack of general social interaction, as well as the additional stress that total isolation induces (Begni et al., 2020). Second, in many of these studies, animals were isolated through adulthood, when testing was conducted; as such, it is also unclear whether and to what extent there may be an effect of acute isolation on the observed phenotypes. Finally, and most notably, the majority of these studies were conducted in only one sex\u2014typically, male subjects\u2014thereby preventing the ability to assess whether there are sex differences in the identified impairments.\nThis final caveat is of critical importance given there are robust sex differences in social play that are seemingly as well-conserved as play itself. Across nearly all species that play, from rodents to humans, male juveniles play more frequently and intensely than females (see VanRyzin et al., 2020a for review). Additionally, there are known sex differences in the qualitative characteristics of social play interactions (Pellis and Pellis, 1990, 1997). Studies investigating the neural underpinnings of this behavioral sex difference have identified various nodes within the larger circuitry of social behavior, including the medial amygdala (VanRyzin et al., 2019) and lateral septum (Bredewold et al., 2014), which exert sex-specific influences on play following sexual differentiation early in life as part of typical brain development. Indeed, deficits in play are core symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and early onset schizophrenia (Alessandri, 1992; Jones et al., 1994; M\u00f8ller and Husby, 2000; Jordan, 2003; Helgeland and Torgersen,\n2005), many of which also exhibit robust sex differences in diagnosis and symptomology (Aleman et al., 2003; Ramtekkar et al., 2010; Arnett et al., 2015; Halladay et al., 2015; Giordano et al., 2021; Prosperi et al., 2021). The robust and conserved nature of this sex difference, then, speaks to its importance and begs the question: does play serve a different purpose in males compared to females?\nHere, we investigate the impact of juvenile play experience on later-life behaviors and how this may differ as a consequence of sex. Juvenile rats of both sexes were deprived of play via one of two different methods or were housed under normal conditions, i.e., controls. For the first play deprivation method, we created perforated Plexiglass cage dividers (\u201cplay barriers\u201d) that could be placed into standard home cages to physically separate the two juvenile rats inside (Figure 1A). Improving upon the previous methodology, this manipulation prevents play while still allowing for other forms of social interaction in the visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile domain. Interaction with a conspecific across a similar physical barrier has been shown to be socially rewarding (Peartree et al., 2012) and to reduce anxiety-like behavior as compared to full isolation, an additional benefit (Klapper-Goldstein et al., 2020). For the second play deprivation method, we eliminated all social interactions (play and non-play) by socially isolating animals via single-housing, as done by others. Animals were placed in these or control housing conditions as juveniles, then re-housed in standard group housing around puberty, after which we assessed the impact on various adult behaviors. Supporting our hypothesis, we found that social play experience impacts later-life endpoints in a sex-specific manner. Play deprivation preferentially impacted behaviors within the socio-sexual domain, decreasing sexual behavior, increasing sociability, and increasing aggressiveness in adulthood in males but not females, providing valuable insight into sex differences in the function of this fundamental adolescent behavior."

This Plexiglass barrier created two identical compartments within the home cage and served to separate the pair of animals and therefore\nprevent them from physically engaging in social play behavior, while still allowing for visual, olfactory, auditory, and tactile communication between the two. In contrast, on P26, ISO rats were placed alone in a new standard cage and subjected to full social isolation. Control rats continued to be housed in pairs for the full extent of this time period. Animals remained in these conditions until P40, when BARR and ISO animals were re-housed in the same same-sex, sibling pairs as before, under\nFrontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience 03 frontiersin.org\nMarquardt et al. 10.3389/fnbeh.2022.1076765\nstandard housing conditions.

In the corner of one chamber (\u201csocial chamber\u201d), a novel same-sex adult (P60+) stimulus rat was placed under a small (20 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 20 cm) clear polycarbonate box (\u201cstimulus box\u201d) containing small 1.25 cm holes to allow the test rat to see, hear, smell, and have some tactile interactions with the stimulus rat. In the corner of the other chamber (\u201cempty chamber\u201d), an identical clear polycarbonate box was placed without a stimulus rat. Test rats were individually placed in the neutral zone of this apparatus and allowed to freely explore for 5 min while video recorded and automatically tracked using ANY-maze software. The time spent in each chamber and the time spent nearby (within 5 cm, deemed the \u201cinteraction zone\u201d) each stimulus box was recorded, and the percentage of time near the social box (time spent in the interaction zone of the social chamber/time spent in the interaction zone of the social chamber + time spent in the interaction zone of the empty chamber) was calculated, as well as the ratio of time spent near the social chamber to time spent near the empty chamber. The position of the social chamber and the empty chamber within the arena was counterbalanced across groups."

After 2 h, a novel same-sex juvenile (P24\u201330) stimulus rat was placed into the test cage with the test rat for 5 min (\u201cTrain\u201d trial) and their interactions were video-recorded. After 5 min, the stimulus rat was removed, and the test rat remained in the test cage for a retention interval of 30 min, after which the same stimulus rat (now familiar) was placed back in the test cage. Interactions between the test rat and the stimulus rat were again recorded for 5 min (\u201cTest\u201d trial). Videos were manually scored offline for the time spent by the test rat investigating the stimulus rat in both tests, and the ratio of the time spent interacting with the stimulus rat on the Test trial (familiar) compared to the Train trial (novel) was calculated. Separately, a control experiment was independently conducted which followed the same procedure; however, a novel stimulus rat was placed in the cage with the test rat in both the Train trial and the Test trial, to control for any effects of a second interaction trial in general, unrelated to recognition of the stimulus animal or the lack thereof."

On P26, animals were individually placed in an enclosure (49 \u00d7 37 cm, 24 cm high) with TEK-Fresh cellulose bedding (Envigo, Indianapolis, IN, USA) containing an empty and open 14 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 9 cm clear polycarbonate confinement box and allowed to explore for 10 min to habituate to the box and arena. This confinement box contained a hinged door that is blocked by a lever when closed, requiring the animal outside the confinement box to push the lever open in order for the animal inside the confinement box to freely escape. On P27, one animal from a sex- and condition-matched cagemate pair was placed inside the confinement box. A funnel filled with ice was positioned over the confinement box, dripping cool water inside and thus motivating the animal to seek release. Video recording and a count-up timer began when the other member of the cagemate pair (the test subject) was placed in the arena. If at any time the test subject released their cagemate from the confinement box, the recording was stopped and the time of release was recorded. Animals were allowed to interact for 10 s, then swiftly returned to CTRL or BARR housing conditions. If 15 min elapsed without release, the lever blocking the door was loosened slightly by the experimenter (turned 90 degrees such that there was no gap in the door but that the lever no longer blocked the exit) to facilitate learning. If an additional 5 min passed (20 min total testing time), the recording was stopped and the door opened further to allow for free exit. In this case, the time of release was denoted as 20 min (the maximum). This procedure was repeated once daily until P38, with each member of the cagemate pair serving the same role each day (i.e., there was no switching as to which member of the pair was the test subject vs. the confined subject)."

Statistical analysis was performed using RStudio (RStudio Team, 2021; version 1.4.1106) and GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA; version 7.04). All data were initially analyzed with a Shapiro-Wilk normality test to determine if data were normally distributed. Data which were normally distributed were then analyzed with a two-way ANOVA with factors for sex and juvenile housing condition (CTRL, BARR, or ISO) unless otherwise stated. If a significant main effect of housing condition or a significant interaction was detected, post hoc analysis was conducted using\na Tukey\u2019s honestly significant difference test to determine which groups differed. If a significant main effect of condition was detected in cases in which a one-way ANOVA was conducted (i.e., tests in which sex was not a factor, such as male sex behavior), post hoc analysis was conducted using Fisher\u2019s least significant difference procedure, as there were three groups (Meier, 2006). In some cases (Novel Object Recognition, Social Preference, and Sex Preference tests), one-sample t-tests were used to determine whether group means differed from chance; additionally, paired t-tests were used to compare the Train trial to the Test trial for the Social Recognition test. Data which were not normally distributed were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests when appropriate, as described in Table 1. Analyses were considered significant when p< 0.05."

Only subjects that had complete datasets were included in the factor analysis. Data were normalized by log transformation, then initially analyzed for adequacy for factor analysis using the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin factor adequacy test and Bartlett\u2019s test of sphericity for the correlation matrix of the dataset. In both the SDB and LDB studies, female data was deemed insufficiently correlated and therefore inadequate for factor analysis based on these indices (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin MSA below 0.5 for both studies; Bartlett\u2019s sphericity p > 0.05). For this reason, we conducted a factor analysis on only the male data, a choice supported by the fact that the vast majority of our observed effects of play deprivation were seen in males but not females. Using male data alone, datasets from both the SDB and LDB study indicated appropriateness for factor analysis, with an overall Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin MSA above 0.5 (SDB: MSA = 0.53; LDB: MSA = 0.53) and a significant p-value for Bartlett\u2019s test (SDB: p = 0.001; LDB: p < 0.001). This resulted in an overall n of 23 for both studies (SDB: n = 6 for CTRL; n = 8 for BARR; n = 9 for ISO. LDB: n = 8 for CTRL; n = 7 for BARR; n = 8 for ISO).\nFactor analysis was then conducted using varimax rotation with a factor-loading cutoff of 0.5. The resulting factors were retained if their eigenvalue was greater than 1 (based on the Kaiser criterion), which generated a three-factor solution for both the SDB and LDB datasets. Behavioral variables which had low communality (below 0.3) and did not load onto any of the three factors above the factor loading cutoff of 0.3 were removed, and analysis was repeated using the parameters described above, again identifying a three-factor solution for both datasets. We then calculated individual factor scores for each subject and analyzed these scores for an effect of condition independently by factor using a one-way ANOVA, as described further above.\nFrontiers

            "text": "To ensure our manipulation did not induce overt behavioral pathology on its own, we began by assessing the acute effects of play deprivation. During the juvenile age (at either P26 or P21 for the open field and playfulness tests, respectively), same-sex sibling pairs of rats of both sexes were placed into control (CTRL) or barrier (BARR) cages or were single-housed in isolation cages (ISO). One week later, we assessed anxiety-like behavior via the open field test. In a separate cohort of BARR and ISO animals, we also assessed playfulness. We found no effect of sex or housing condition on center time in the open field (Figure 1B). As seen in previous studies of juvenile isolation (Panksepp and Beatty, 1980; Ikemoto and Panksepp, 1992), we found that the ability and motivation to participate in play was not only intact in BARR and ISO animals but was increased relative to our historical data for control-housed animals (Figure 1C; Argue and McCarthy, 2015). Interestingly, when we assessed the BARR and ISO play data, we detected a significant main effect of both sex (p = 0.036) and treatment (p = 0.026), with males of both housing conditions and ISO animals of both sexes playing significantly more than females and BARR animals, respectively. However, this effect of the condition seems to be driven more strongly in females than in males. Although the sex \u00d7 condition interaction did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.13), the mean difference in play levels between female BARR and ISO animals (12.7 vs. 29.0 play events) is much larger than that of male BARR and ISO animals (28.6 vs. 31.9 play events). This suggests that the increased social interaction allowed by the BARR housing condition is sufficient to reduce play motivation in females but not males, an unexpected finding speaking to the differential role that play may serve in females compared to males. Overall, these initial studies indicate that the modified housing used to prevent play does not in itself increase anxiety-like behavior or impair the ability to play if given the opportunity and provides intriguing evidence in support of the idea that play may serve different purposes across the sexes.\nFor adult behavioral experiments, rats were weaned on P21 into same-sex sibling pairs. In the short duration barrier experiments (SDB), rats were then placed into barrier or isolation cages starting on P26 or remained in control housing conditions (Figure 1D). Animals remained in these conditions until P40, a 2-week period encompassing the peak of the window in which social play is maximally expressed (Panksepp, 1981), after which they were returned to standard group housing for the remainder of the experiments. To determine whether there were any sex differences in resiliency to play deprivation, we repeated our behavioral assays in the long duration barrier experiments (LDB). In this study, animals were placed in control, barrier, or isolation conditions for as long as could be tolerated based on size: starting at weaning (P21) and lasting until P45, an age when rats of both sexes have typically entered puberty, at which\nFrontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience 15 frontiersin.org\nMarquardt et al. 10.3389/fnbeh.2022.1076765\npoint playfulness dramatically decreases (Meaney and Stewart, 1981; Panksepp, 1981). Given the relatively short period of time in which playfulness is seen in rats, the additional 10 days of play deprivation in the LDB study (an additional 5 days before and 5 days after the SDB deprivation period) represents an appreciable expansion in play deprivation time as compared to the SDB study, while maintaining specificity to the time period in which play is the predominant social behavior."

First, we assessed performance on the elevated plus maze at P47, one week after BARR and ISO animals were returned to standard housing conditions in the SDB study and two days after the return to standard housing in the LDB study. Second, we assessed performance on the open field test at P59. This latter open field test was only conducted in the LDB study, as the SDB animals were exposed to the open field in our initial studies (Figure 1C) and as such it was no longer novel. In both tests, we assessed measures of both anxiety-like behavior and hyperactivity."

Mirroring these findings, we observed a significant main effect of sex in the distance traveled in the maze in both studies (SDB: p = 0.034; LDB: p = 0.005; Figures 2B,D), with males exploring the maze significantly less than females. In the LDB animals, we also observed a main effect of condition (p < 0.001) on distance traveled. Post hoc analysis indicated that BARR animals of both sexes were significantly more active in the maze than both CTRL (p< 0.001) and ISO (p = 0.003) animals."

Additionally, we observed an increase in hyperactivity in animals deprived of play (Figure 2F). Post hoc analysis following a significant main effect of both sex\n(p < 0.001) and condition (p = 0.013) on the number of gridline crossings indicated that CTRL animals of both sexes were significantly less locomotive than BARR animals (p = 0.01), with a trending effect when compared to ISO animals as well (p = 0.117).

To ensure the artificial hormonal priming was not obscuring a potential deficit, we allowed for natural cycling in the LDB study, conducting the behavioral assay when female subjects were in proestrus and thus sexually receptive. Even in naturally cycling conditions, we again observed no effect of play deprivation on either sexual receptivity or proceptivity (Figures 4C,D)."

Bars indicate group means \u00b1 SEM, and open circles represent data from individual rats. n = 7\u201314 per group.\nWe also assessed the proportion of animals that ejaculated across the two tests of sexual behavior. It is well known in the field of rodent sexual behavior that around 10% of all sexually mature male rats will be \u201cduds\u201d (otherwise known as \u201csexually sluggish\u201d), meaning that they do not ejaculate in the\ncourse of a 20\u201330 min assay with a sexually receptive female (Dewsbury, 1972; Pattij et al., 2005; Portillo et al., 2006). To determine if play deprivation affected the incidence of \u201cduds\u201d, we calculated the proportion of animals in each group that ejaculated in one or both of the 20-min sex behavior tests, compared to the proportion that did not ejaculate in either test. We then conducted individual chi-square goodness of fit tests comparing the distribution of each group (Male CTRL, BARR, and ISO) to the expected distribution (90% ejaculators, 10% non-ejaculators/\u201cduds\u201d). In the SDB animals, the distribution of ejaculators vs. non-ejaculators did not significantly differ from the expected distribution across any of the three groups (Figure 5D). In the LDB animals, CTRL males also did not show a significant difference (Figure 5H). However, the distribution of ejaculators vs. non-ejaculators in BARR (p = 0.002) and ISO (p < 0.001) males significantly differed from the expected distribution. In both groups, only \u223c60% of animals ejaculated in one or both tests, while \u223c40% were \u201cduds\u201d. Together, these studies indicate that juvenile play deprivation impairs both the number/rate of sexual behaviors (SDB and LDB) and the proportion of animals which successfully ejaculate (LDB) in adult males, a notable finding given the paramount importance sexual behavior plays in reproductive fitness."

The first factor (31.3% of total variance) contained positive loadings for distance traveled and percent of the time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze, with negative loading for social recognition. As these enriched behaviors generally reflected measures of a latent anxiety-like phenotype, we renamed it accordingly (\u201cAnxiety\u201d).

            "text": "Here, we report persistent alterations in the expression of various adult behaviors following juvenile play deprivation in rats. We demonstrate that social play experience is critical for the development of appropriate socio-sexual behavior in males, as males prevented from playing as juveniles exhibited altered sexual behavior, sociability, and aggressive behavior. These effects are complex and pervasive, seen weeks to months after all animals were returned to group housing, and impact reproductively critical behaviors. In females, however, play is more dispensable. While rats of both sexes were hyperactive shortly after play deprivation and displayed impairments in a test of empathy motivation when acutely prevented from playing, we observed no effects in females on any other test in the diverse battery we conducted.\nGiven the importance for reproductive fitness, the most striking of our findings is the lasting effect of play deprivation on male sexual behavior. Males prevented from playing for as little as 2 weeks (in the SDB study) showed a significant reduction in mount rate across two tests of sexual behavior. This was seen in both BARR and ISO males, indicating that the lack of play, not the lack of social interaction writ large, was the critical driver of this impairment. Moreover, this impairment did not seem to represent a simple delay in the learning process, but rather a persistent reduction in the rate of copulatory behavior; while we present the data here as an average, the deficit in BARR and ISO males was evident across both successive tests. Furthermore, males prevented from playing for as little as 3.5 weeks (in the LDB study) also exhibited deficits in ejaculation. Around 40% of BARR and ISO males did not ejaculate in either test of copulatory behavior, a significant deviation from what was seen in CTRL males (12.5%) and from the expected distribution\nFrontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience 24 frontiersin.org\nMarquardt et al. 10.3389/fnbeh.2022.1076765\nFIGURE 10 Juvenile play deprivation impairs performance on a test of empathy/prosocial helping behavior.

Remarkably, these impairments were close to the magnitude seen in other studies in which male copulatory behavior is altered by more substantial pharmacological or genetic manipulations, despite the fact that our manipulation merely prevented juveniles from playing for a short window of time. For example, the decrease in the number of mounts we observed was of similar magnitude to that seen in males treated with a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor for 2 weeks during the perinatal sensitive period (Amateau and McCarthy, 2004), and the reduction in the percentage of animals which successfully\nejaculated we observed was similar to that seen in males in which both the androgen receptor and estrogen receptor alpha were genetically deleted (Trouillet et al., 2022).\nWe also found that play deprivation induces hypersociability in adulthood. In the SDB study, BARR males exhibited social preference that was significantly higher than that seen in all other groups. This hypersocial phenotype was seen across multiple SDB cohorts, and the effect size was substantial (Cohen\u2019s d ranging between 1.9 and 2.9 for all pairwise comparisons between Male BARR and the other groups for percent of time near the social box; Figure 6A). However, there was no effect on social preference in the LDB animals.

Work from Hol et al. (1999) demonstrated that social isolation from P22\u201328, but not P29\u201335, decreases sociability in adulthood in male rats. Isolation across the full window, from P22\u201335, also decreased sociability. This finding was mirrored by a study in females which found that isolation from P19\u201370 also decreases sociability (Hermes et al., 2011). In contrast, isolation starting later in adolescence, from P28\u201370, was shown to produce hypersociability in both sexes, although this study was conducted in mice (Rivera-Irizarry et al., 2020). Looking at the intersection of these studies, it is possible that two distinct sensitive periods exist, perhaps governed by the maturation of distinct sets of social circuitry: one window from \u223cP19\u201328, in which the lack of play experience causes hyposociability, and another starting at \u223cP35, in which the lack of play experience causes hypersociability. In this view, it is possible we observed no effect on sociability in the LDB study as the play deprivation spanned across those\nwindows (from P21\u201345), canceling out any effects. It is also possible that the additional stress caused by full isolation may alter the direction and magnitude of these effects, given ours were seen only in BARR, but not ISO, males. Future studies should more closely investigate the possibility of these distinct sensitive periods and whether they may differ based on sex, given the hypersocial phenotype we observed was seen only in males.\nOne of many theories regarding the function of social play is the \u201cplay-as-practice\u201d theory, which argues that the individual behaviors constituting social play (e.g., pounces, pins, and boxing behaviors in rats) resemble adult agonistic behaviors for a reason: because play serves as practice for later-life aggressive encounters (Fagen, 1981; Smith, 1997). This theory has received criticism for various reasons, primarily that there are several key differences in the microstructure of juvenile play-fighting and adult aggressive behaviors, thus hindering play\u2019s applicability as a means of physical \u201cpractice\u201d (Pellis and Pellis, 1987). We here provide further evidence\nFrontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience 26 frontiersin.org\nMarquardt et al. 10.3389/fnbeh.2022.1076765\nagainst the play-as-practice theory, as we demonstrate that juvenile play deprivation increases aggressive behavior in adult males, not decreases as a straightforward interpretation of the theory would predict. Nonetheless, a more complex interpretation of the theory may be better justified. While it seems evident that play does not serve as simple practice for the motor skills needed for later-life agonistic behavior, perhaps what is gained from play is experience in its reciprocal nature. This reciprocity\u2014necessitating monitoring one\u2019s own actions and those of a partner, recognizing social signals indicating the partner\u2019s responses and intentions, and adjusting one\u2019s actions appropriately to maintain the backand-forth of the play bout\u2014is a fundamental feature of social play (Pellis and Pellis, 2017), so play may serve to provide experience in these social skills, allowing for the maturation of brain circuitry to the same effect. Animals deprived of play may lack this experience, thereby hindering their ability to appropriately recognize and/or respond to social signals to de-escalate an agonistic encounter, resulting in increased aggression as we observed. Indeed, recent work in Drosophila identified a transcriptional regulator believed to govern this same effect, suppressing aggression in a social experience-dependent manner (Ishii et al., 2022), and long-term post-weaning social isolation has been shown to induce qualitative differences in the attack patterns of male rats (Toth et al., 2011).\nWe also conducted a test of prosocial motivation in animals acutely deprived of play starting a week before and continuing throughout the 12 days of testing. BARR animals of both sexes performed worse on this task, taking significantly longer to free their distressed cagemate from a confinement box on the first 6 days of testing. This impairment was resolved by the latter half of testing, with the performance of play-deprived animals improving to that seen in controls on days 7\u201312 of the paradigm. This finding may serve as another example of the concept that play aids in developing the ability to appropriately sense and respond to social signals. In this view, BARR animals may perform worse on the empathy test due to a deficit in their perception of and/or responsiveness to the social signals generated by their distressed cagemate. This impairment may have improved over time due to the increased social experience afforded as part of the test (while animals were allowed only 10 s to interact with their cagemate following release from the confinement box, this social experience may have accumulated over time), or because animals had sufficient experience with the paradigm by the latter half of testing such that it allowed BARR animals to \u201ccatch up\u201d to controls. We also observed a sex difference in this assay: males generally performed worse than females, as they exhibited a significantly higher latency to release their cagemate on average in the first half of testing. This too may speak to the heightened importance of play experience in males compared to females, given even at baseline males are less successful on this socially-driven task.\nImportantly, we saw no effects of play deprivation on any other assessed behavior, with the exception of a small but significant effect on locomotion shortly after animals were returned to standard group housing. Our findings in which we observed play deprivation had no effect\u2014on anxiety-like behavior, object memory, sex preference, and social recognition in both sexes and on sex behavior and social preference in females\u2014are just as informative as our findings in which we did observe an effect, in that they show what play experience does not seem to be important for. The effects of play deprivation (and therefore, the importance of play itself) seem to preferentially center around socio-sexual behaviors in adulthood, a concept further supported by our factor analyses, which in an independent and unbiased manner identified factors in both the SDB and LDB studies that represent socio-sexual behavior and significantly differed in control and play-deprived males.\nThis specificity to socio-sexual behavior makes sense, given play is itself a social behavior and involves the activity of many regions in the social circuitry, such as the medial amygdala, lateral septum, and hypothalamus (summarized in Siviy, 2016 and VanRyzin et al., 2020a). These regions have distinct roles in socio-sexual behavior in adulthood as well, often driven by distinct, separable cell type-specific and projection-specific mechanisms (Unger et al., 2015; Wong et al., 2016; Ishii et al., 2017; Kohl et al., 2018). The maturation of these cell subtypes and/or projections, then, may be modulated in an experiencedependent (and, potentially, sex-dependent) manner based on playfulness. Like the importance of visual experience for the development of ocular dominance in V1 neurons (Wiesel and Hubel, 1963) or somatosensory experience for dendritic spine dynamics in the barrel cortex (Lendvai et al., 2000), play experience may be fundamental to the developmental firing and wiring of individual cells and projections that establishes appropriate adult circuit organization. However, the fact that the impairments we observed following play deprivation were generally specific to males begs the question: in this view, what, if anything, governs social circuit maturation in females? Does social experience (play or non-play) have any role? In our initial studies, we found that the additional non-play social experience provided by the BARR vs. the ISO housing condition is sufficient to decrease play motivation in females but not males (Figure 1C), suggesting that play itself is the critical feature driving the motivation to play in males. Perhaps in females, the significance of play is more so the social experience in general, and less so the experience of play itself. Even then, it appears little social experience during the juvenile window is necessary for appropriate social development in females, given we observed few impairments following even full social isolation. Future studies should investigate whether the window for experience-dependent social circuit organization is shifted in females compared to males, or if, perhaps, female social circuit maturation is not experience-dependent at all.\nFrontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience 27 frontiersin.org\nMarquardt et al. 10.3389/fnbeh.2022.1076765\nWhile our BARR manipulation improves upon previous methodology in that it prevents play while allowing for other forms of social interaction, there are nonetheless limitations. BARR animals are also deprived of other tactile non-play social interactions such as social grooming, and there may be other variables such as the difference in physical space allowed by the BARR vs. CTRL and ISO conditions that may affect development. Nevertheless, the convergence of evidence from our study and others using different manipulations (e.g., reducing play by rearing juveniles with an adult or a peer from a less playful strain) points to play experience being the critical driver of the impairments observed (Schneider et al., 2016; Burleson et al., 2016; Pellis et al., 2017; Stark and Pellis, 2020, 2021). Additionally, while females appeared largely resilient to play deprivation across the myriad of behavioral assays we conducted, this may not be true for all traits, or there may be latent differences in our assessed traits not detectable by the paradigms we used to evaluate them. Regardless, this female resilience is notable, supporting our hypothesis that the purpose of play differs across the sexes, at least in the rat.\nEmbedded within our studies is also a deep assessment of sex differences and similarities across a wide variety of behavioral tests in rats. When possible (i.e., in assays that are not only applicable to animals of one sex), males and females were included in all experiments, all of which were adequately powered to detect sex differences if they were present. We statistically tested sex as a variable, calling a finding a \u201csex difference\u201d if and only if we detected a significant main effect of sex or a significant interaction. This was as opposed to independently assessing males and females and noting a sex difference if we observed an effect in one sex but not the other, a common misconception of the appropriate way to assess sex differences (Garcia-Sifuentes and Maney, 2021). As the research community works to better address sex as a biological variable (SABV), especially following the implementation of the United States National Institutes of Health\u2019s 2016 policy requiring consideration of SABV in all funded research, we hope this work is useful to behavioral neuroscientists interested in the differences and similarities in male and female rats across various behavioral domains.\nFinally, our results are especially relevant in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. We began these studies shortly before shutdowns began in early 2020, impacting access to play for millions of children worldwide, and as such our experiments became even more relevant. While our studies were conducted in rats, social play is remarkably similar across the many mammalian species in which it is expressed and has strong face validity in humans. Our results would argue that boys may be more vulnerable to a reduction in access to play than girls. This potential sex difference in the influence of the pandemic on child health and brain development is something that should be monitored as we collectively move forward."
