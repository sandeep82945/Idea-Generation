    "abstractText": "A number of parasiticides are commercially available as companion animal treatments to protect against parasite infestation and are sold in large volumes. These treatments are not intended to enter the wider environment but may be washed off or excreted by treated animals and have ecotoxic impacts. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify the existing evidence for the toxicity of the six most used parasiticides in the UK: imidacloprid, fipronil, fluralaner, afoxolaner, selamectin, and flumethrin. A total of 17,207 published articles were screened, with 690 included in the final evidence synthesis. All parasiticides displayed higher toxicity towards invertebrates than vertebrates, enabling their use as companion animal treatments. Extensive evidence exists of ecotoxicity for imidacloprid and fipronil, but this focuses on exposure via agricultural use and is not representative of environmental exposure that results from use in companion animal treatments, especially in urban greenspace. Little to no evidence exists for the ecotoxicity of the remaining parasiticides. Despite heavy usage, there is currently insufficient evidence to understand the environmental risk posed by these veterinary treatments and further studies are urgently needed to quantify the levels and characterise the routes of environmental exposure, as well as identifying any resulting environmental harm.",

            "text": "Over 14,000\u00a0years ago, in the region of Bonn-Oberkassel in what is now Germany, a young dog was cared for through multiple bouts of illness, believed to be canine distemper. This dog was buried alongside two humans, and its skeleton provides us with the oldest evidence of an emotional bond between people and dogs (Janssens et\u00a0al 2018). In the UK now, around 26% of adults own dogs, and 24% cats, and there are approximately 10 million dogs and 11 million cats in the country (PDSA 2020). Along with bacterial and viral\ndiseases, both cats and dogs are vulnerable to a range of external and internal parasites, including fleas, ticks, lice, mites, and numerous types of enteric worm. These may cause morbidity and mortality in animals and can also be transferred to humans. As a result, products to prevent and treat parasite infestations in companion animals are widely used. In 2019, animal parasite prevention products and treatments, known as parasiticides, occupied 39% of the UK animal medicines market, amounting to \u00a3725 million (\u20ac890\u00a0M, $1,010\u00a0M) in sales (NOAH n.d.). Parasiticides come in three categories: ectoparasiticides which prevent and treat external parasites, endoparasiticides which prevent and treat internal parasites, and endectocides which prevent and treat both external and internal parasites.\nCompanion animal parasiticide treatment\nFor companion animals, such as cats and dogs, European Scientific Counsel Companion Animal Parasites (ESCCAP) guidelines recommend individual risk assessments for parasites, and \u2018regular treatment\u2019 against fleas and ticks\nResponsible Editor: Ludek Blaha\n* C. M. Tilly Collins t.collins@imperial.ac.uk\nClodagh Wells clodaghwells@gmail.com\n1 The Centre for\u00a0Environmental Policy, Imperial College London, The Weeks Building, Princes Gardens, London\u00a0SW7\u00a01NE, UK\n1 3\nfor all animals with outside access (ESCCAP 2018). For worm prevention, the ESCCAP recommendation is for between 1 and 12 treatments a year depending on risk, but a recent survey (Pennelegion et\u00a0al 2020) found that 68% of cats and 97% of dogs fell into the ESCCAP\u2019s highest risk category, with none considered low risk. In line with this, many veterinary clinics recommend applying parasiticide products continually throughout the year and offer animal health plans that provide year-round parasite prevention.\nIn the UK, companion animal parasiticides are available online, from veterinary surgeries, and over the counter (BVA 2021); they include spot-on (applied to skin) treatments, tablets, food additives, shampoos, and infused collars. These products contain a range of active ingredients (AIs), classed as insecticides, acaricides, larvicides, and insect growth regulators. The prophylactic prescription of these parasiticides is now causing concern among industry professionals (Little and Boxall\u00a02020; Tarr\u00a02020), and the European Medicines Agency\u2019s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) is preparing a reflection paper on the issue (2020).\nProphylactic parasiticide products do provide benefits, notably in the prevention of suffering and disease in companion animals, in accordance with the fundamental animal welfare principle of freedom from pain, injury, and disease (Animal Welfare Act 2006). Prophylactic companion animal treatments will also prevent zoonotic transmission of parasites and accompanying diseases to people coming into contact with these animals, and therefore be of some benefit to public health (BVA 2021). It is however difficult to say whether the risk of parasites and the actual harm caused to companion animals, as well as humans, are sufficient to justify widespread prophylactic use.\nBroad-spectrum products that contain multiple AIs have been developed, such as Broadline\u00ae by Boehringer Ingelheim. The need for this product was justified by a finding that 0.69% of the surveyed population carried three parasites (ectoparasites, tapeworms, and roundworms). (CVMP 2014a). As such a small proportion of the surveyed population carried three parasites, and the consequent morbidity was not considered, the necessity of these combination products is questionable. Screening of the over 1.6 million electronic health records collected by the University of Liverpool\u2019s Small Animal Veterinary Surveillance Network (SAVSNET) between 2014 and 2016 found ticks noted as present in 0.13% of records, though this is expected to be an underestimation of the true number of ticks (Tulloch et\u00a0al 2017). The corresponding use of parasiticides was not reported. Further analysis of SAVSNET data will aim to better establish prevalence of parasites and related morbidity (A. Prentis, 2021, personal communication), but this information is not currently available."

            "text": "In recent years, there has been suggestion that the AIs in these parasiticides may be harming the environment. Despite very limited recent use in agriculture, imidacloprid above chronic pollution levels was found in three urban streams (Shardlow 2017). In this case, veterinary \u2018spot-ons\u2019 (treatments applied to skin) and flea collars are considered the likely pollution source. A more recent study funded by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate found imidacloprid present in 65.9% of English rivers sampled, with several sites above chronic toxicity levels (Perkins et\u00a0al. 2021). A second insecticide commonly used in parasiticides, fipronil, was found in 98.6% of these samples. The situation in the USA is similar, with imidacloprid and fipronil detected at 100% of wastewater treatment plants sampled in California (Sadaria et\u00a0al. 2017). The very low variability in daily per capita load detected in this study indicates many small sources are responsible for this contamination. Although this insecticide pollution is not conclusively from veterinary parasiticides, the geography of its occurrence suggests urban sources (Sadaria et\u00a0al. 2017).\nThere are multiple pathways through which the AIs in parasiticides administered to companion animals may enter the environment (Fig.\u00a01). Several of these have been demonstrated for fipronil, which can be found on the skin and hair of treated animals (Dyk et\u00a0al. 2012), as well as in significantly higher quantities in the dust of households with fipronil-treated animals (Mahler et\u00a0al.\u00a02009). Fipronil and its degradates are also known to be present in the rinsate of washed dogs previously treated with fipronilcontaining topical parasiticides (Teerlink et\u00a0al 2017).\nIn response to the discovery of imidacloprid and neonicotinoids in UK rivers, the National Office of Animal Health (NOAH) stated that so far \u2018actual evidence of environmental damage being caused by veterinary medicines in these rivers has not been demonstrated\u2019 (Imrie 2020). It should be noted though that the environmental exposure considered safe in the regulatory literature for imidacloprid-containing companion animal parasiticides is far above levels that cause toxicity in aquatic organisms (Perkins et\u00a0al 2021)."

For many companion animal\n1 3\nveterinary products, the assessment stops at Phase I, as the EMA notes \u2018products used in these animals are usually individual treatments [\u2026] likely to be associated with fewer environmental concerns\u2019 (CVMP 2000). The CVMP does, however, recommend a specific risk mitigation measure for topical parasite treatments applied to dogs, in the form of manufacturers\u2019 instructions to not allow treated dogs in waterways for a set period of time (CVMP 2000). While some companion animals parasiticide treatments are prescription only, others are available from a registered qualified person or over the counter (NOAH n.d.). All categories are available online with required checks at purchase point.\nCompanion animal parasiticides are authorised for use on the assumption that the benefits they provide outweigh the harm, or the possibility of harm. The benefit of treating individual animals with suspected parasite infestations can be reasonably expected to outweigh the environmental harm caused by a singular dose of parasiticide. The benefit of prophylactically treating an entire population of healthy animals, however, cannot necessarily be expected to outweigh the environmental harm caused by millions of doses of parasiticides. Although the regulatory authorities currently consider this balance to be favourable, there are three major knowledge gaps:\n\u2022 The benefit of prophylactic parasite treatment to companion animals and humans in terms of both animal welfare and public health particularly in the form of reduced\nmorbidity and mortality, which is currently poorly characterised and varies geographically according to parasite burden. \u2022 The volume of parasiticides that enter the environment, which is dependent largely on owner and animal behaviour and compliance with product application and handling instructions \u2022 The toxicity of parasiticides to non-target species in the environment; the subject of this current review."

As there are so few tests using companion animal parasiticides, this review additionally includes tests of technical grade (TG) active ingredients (defined here as > 95% pure). We synthesise here the existing body of evidence for environmental impact of the six mostused companion animal parasiticide active ingredients in the UK (see justification below).

Imidacloprid is an agonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in postsynaptic neurons and binds irreversibly to these receptors, causing neurotoxicity and death (Simon-Delso et\u00a0al. 2015). Neonicotinoids have largely replaced older insecticides in agriculture due to their higher affinity for insect nAChR subtypes over mammalian subtypes, and ability to be applied as plant protection products at very low rates, leading to increased worker safety (Sheets et\u00a0al. 2016). The first neonicotinoid to be developed, imidacloprid, was introduced into the market in 1991 and by 2008 occupied 24% of the global agrochemical crop protection market (Blacquiere et\u00a0al. 2012). Neonicotinoids were implicated in the global decline of bees, and use was severely restricted in the EU in 2013, followed by a total ban on outdoor use in 2018 (European Commission 2018). This history of widespread agricultural use and subsequent regulatory scrutiny has resulted in an extensive body of research on the ecotoxicity of neonicotinoids."

After topical application, imidacloprid is absorbed into sebaceous glands and spreads out from the application site across the body without being absorbed into the bloodstream (Craig et\u00a0al 2005). As imidacloprid remains on the surface of animals and is generally stable in light and water (CVMP 2009), metabolites and degradates are not considered to contribute to its environmental toxicity. Aquatic exposure may occur through treated dogs entering bodies of water, being bathed, or through rainfall wash-off (Perkins et\u00a0al. 2021). Wash-off\n1 3\nthat alters aquatic insect community structure is recognised to occur with insecticide use in agriculture (Cavallaro et\u00a0al. 2018).\nImidacloprid can be detected on the coat and skin of treated animals for the entire period between treatments (CVMP 2009), and environmental exposure will occur continuously through shed hair and wash-off after bathing and swimming. An mean value of 254 parts per million imidacloprid was identified when stroking a treated dog after 24\u00a0h (Craig et\u00a0al. 2005) and, though there are no direct examples\nof toxicity through this route of exposure, contaminated dust is a major concern in agriculture (Bonmatin et\u00a0al. 2015)."

The safety towards mammals is demonstrated in the European Public Access Report (EPAR), with relatively\nhigh median lethal dose (LD50), and no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) values presented for multiple exposure routes in rats and mice (Table\u00a02). At high doses, imidacloprid is found to exhibit toxicity on the liver and thyroid of treated animals.\nAs classic toxicology model species, mice and rats are heavily represented in the published literature, making up the vast majority (88%) of the mammal species tested with 23 and 30 studies on mice and rats respectively, all of which reported sublethal effects. Although not noted in the EPAR, immunotoxicity was observed in laboratory mice (Badgujar et\u00a0al. 2013) and in\u00a0vitro testing (Shi et\u00a0al 2018). Other signs of toxicity in mice included decreased body weight, gut microbiome and endocrine system disruption, increased oxidative stress, and apoptosis (Yang et\u00a0al. 2020; Yuan et\u00a0al. 2020). Developmental toxicity was also observed, with offspring of treated mice found to exhibit altered brain development, brain function, and behaviour (Burke et\u00a0al. 2018; Nakayama et\u00a0al. 2019). Similar signs of toxicity occurred in rats, including immunotoxicity (Gawade et\u00a0al 2013), decreased body weight (Bhardwaj et\u00a0al. 2010), oxidative stress (Duzguner and Erdogan 2010), and apoptosis (AbdElhakim et\u00a0al. 2018).\nWith the mammal species, the most sensitive end point was tissue damage and decreased testosterone in rats with 90-day exposure to 0.06\u00a0mg/kg bw/day. (Zhao et\u00a0al. 2021). White deer were also found to exhibit signs of toxicity including decreased body weight and fawn survival after drinking water at a dose of 1500\u00a0ng imidacloprid/L. Technical grade imidacloprid was used in all studies but one; a case study in which Advantage\u00ae (Bayer) was used successfully to treat 6 marsupial species, at a maximum dose of 26.3\u00a0mg/ kg bw in a Fat-tailed dunnart (Baker and Beveridge 2001). Birds appear to exhibit a higher susceptibility to imidacloprid, with a 24-h oral LD50 of 17.02\u00a0mg/kg bw in Japanese quail (Rawi et\u00a0al. 2019). Sublethal effects in the form of decreased body weight and impaired orientation occurred in white-crowned sparrows with a 3-day oral dose above 4.1\u00a0\u00b5g/g bw/day (Eng et\u00a0al. 2017). In agriculture, imidacloprid-treated seeds are recognised as a route of exposure for\nbirds, but this kind of direct ingestion is unlikely to occur with parasiticide treatments.\nVariation in routes of exposure, experimental conditions, and sublethal endpoints used make comparison between species challenging. For aquatic vertebrates, sufficient studies reported 96-h LD50 values to allow some comparisons, with imidacloprid demonstrating lower toxicity towards fish and amphibians than other taxa when grouped (Fig.\u00a03). In chordates, 96-h LC50 values range from 6,680\u00a0\u00b5g/L in Common carp up to 550,000\u00a0\u00b5g/L in Rohu (Gradila 2013)."

Of these, 20% concerned crop pest insects which are typically tested for susceptibility to imidacloprid by leaf-dip or spray techniques. These techniques represent agricultural exposure but are not relevant in this context.\nUnder 96-h aquatic exposure, and using a commonly reported endpoint, median lethal concentrations (LD50) varied from 3.56\u00a0\u00b5g/L in the non-biting midge Chironomus\n1 3\ndilutus (Wei et\u00a0al. 2020) to 25,000\u00a0\u00b5g/L in Nitocra spinipes, a small marine crustacean, though immobilisation occurs for N. spinipes at 25\u00a0\u00b5g/L (Moeris et\u00a0al. 2021). While lethal endpoints, such as median mortality, are commonly reported, immobilisation and other sublethal endpoints are more sensitive and critical in assessing toxicity to non-target species.\nFor aquatic arthropods, sublethal impacts of imidacloprid occur at substantially lower concentrations. For example, 1\u00a0\u00b5g imidacloprid per litre of water causes reduced defensive behaviour in rusty crayfish (Sohn et\u00a0al. 2018), reduced time between moulting in brown shrimp (Al-Badran et\u00a0al. 2019), and downstream drift of a mayfly species (Beketov and Liess 2008). For terrestrial invertebrates, which may be exposed when contaminated water leaches into the ground, toxicity was tested extensively in soil worms. The most sensitive endpoint was decreased growth and hatching of cocoons in the earthworm Eisenia fetida, occurring after 14-day exposure to 0.02\u00a0mg imidacloprid/kg soil (Wang et\u00a0al. 2015). Evidence of toxicity in other phyla was largely absent or variable; the short-term no observed effect concentration (NOEC) was 263\u00a0\u03bcg/L in a coral species (Flores et\u00a0al. 2020) and 17,500\u00a0\u03bcg/L in a rotifer species (Gharaei et\u00a0al. 2020).\nSeveral aquatic invertebrate community-level studies were identified for imidacloprid. Their exposure scenarios varied, including \u2018pulsed\u2019 exposure that may occur during adverse weather (Char\u00e1-Serna et\u00a0al. 2019) and steady exposure (Maloney et\u00a0al. 2018), with shifts in community structure found at as low as 0.05\u00a0\u03bcg/L (Cavallaro et\u00a0al. 2018). Pulse exposure may potentially be achieved by a recently treated dog entering a body of water, while steady low-level exposure can be expected in streams downstream of wastewater treatment plants. Imidacloprid was more toxic under Mediterranean conditions relative to more temperate conditions (Rico et\u00a0al. 2018) suggesting that greater caution may be needed under future climate scenarios.\nThe aquatic toxicity of imidacloprid in parasiticide treatments was considered when the spot-on product Advocate\u00ae (Bayer) was authorised for use in the EU in 2003. The EPAR provides a predicted no-effect concentration of 850\u00a0\u03bcg/L (CVMP 2009), above the median lethal dose for the majority of tested arthropod species (Fig.\u00a03). A lack of ecotoxicity data led to imidacloprid originally being considered safe to aquatic organisms (Tisler et\u00a0al. 2009), and it is now recognised that the standard aquatic toxicity test species, the water flea Daphnia magna, displays an unusually high and unrepresentative level of tolerance towards imidacloprid (Li et\u00a0al. 2021)."

Like imidacloprid, fipronil causes neurotoxicity and exhibits a higher affinity for insect receptors than their vertebrate equivalents. Fipronil binds to both gamma-aminobutryric acid (GABA) receptors (which are ligand-gated chloride channels) and glutamate-gated chloride channels, but the primary mode of action is believed to be through the glutamate-gated channels, which are not found in mammals (Narahashi et\u00a0al. 2010). Fipronil is also a chiral molecule typically sold and used as a racemate (a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers), with some species displaying differential sensitivity to these enantiomers (Konwick et\u00a0al. 2005; Overmyer et\u00a0al. 2007; Qu et\u00a0al. 2014)."

Fipronil sulfone demonstrates higher toxicity than fipronil itself in boll weevils (Mulrooney and Goli 1999) and rice borers (Fang et\u00a0al. 2008) and may thus be of environmental concern. The rinsate, however, from treated dogs consisted primarily of fipronil (Teerlink et\u00a0al. 2017).

At high doses, fipronil has been noted to cause neurotoxicity in treated animals.\nMice and rats featured in the literature, with sublethal observations including lung inflammation (Merkowsky et\u00a0al. 2016), disrupted thyroid function (Martin et\u00a0al. 2020), and neurodegeneration (Bharatiya et\u00a0al. 2020). Reproductive toxicity, such as reproductive cycle disruption and decreased sperm motility, occurred at 14-day oral exposure to 3\u00a0mg/ kg bw in female and male rats respectively (de Barros et\u00a0al. 2017; 2016). Toxicity in birds occurred at similar levels, with behavioural changes and oxidative damage in the heart and lungs of Japanese quail at long term exposure to 2.26\u00a0mg/kg bw (Khalil et\u00a0al. 2017; 2019).\n1 3\nIn fish, the 96-h LC 50 of Eurasian carp (Cyprinus carpio) fry was 428\u00a0 \u03bcg/L, while altered haemato-biochemical response occurred with chronic (15-day) exposure to 142\u00a0\u03bcg/L, uninflated swim bladder, and spine malformation (Gupta et\u00a0al. 2014).

Under 96-h aquatic exposure, LD50 ranged from 0.113\u00a0\u03bcg/L in the Little yellow stonefly Isoperla quinquepunctata (Weston and Lydy 2014) to 450\u00a0\u03bcg/L in the springtail Folsomia candida (San Miguel et\u00a0al. 2008).

Fluralaner was authorised a year later as Bravecto\u00ae (Merck Animal Health) first in chewable tablet form, then as a spot-on product, both with 12-week efficacy (Weber and Selzer 2016). Despite their popularity as parasiticides, there is very little information about the non-target toxicity of either available in the published literature. Both exist as chiral molecule and are sold as a racemate, with one record of enantioselective toxicity towards fluralaner identified (discussed below)."

When the spot-on formulation was later registered, the Phase II assessment concluded that any environmental risk would be sufficiently mitigated by including a recommendation in the product leaflet to prevent treated animals from swimming for three days (CVMP 2016). Owners might be motivated to comply as wash-off will reduce efficacy of the treatment, but there is little evidence whether this crucial recommendation is received or applied in practice.\nThe commercially available dose for both spot-on and oral Bravecto\u00ae is 500\u00a0mg for a 15\u00a0kg dog (33\u00a0mg/kg bw) and 250\u00a0mg for a 4.5\u00a0kg cat (56\u00a0mg/kg bw), designed to last for a 12-week period (CVMP 2014b). With both routes of application, fluralaner is absorbed into the body and accumulated\n1 3\nin the plasma of treated animals, with a plasma half-life of 12\u201315\u00a0days. Ultimately, 90% of the dose is excreted in the faeces as an unchanged compound (CVMP 2014b). Fluralaner is very persistent in soil (CVMP 2017), and it is feasible that fluralaner is present in the faeces of treated animals in sufficient concentration to cause toxicity in feeding insects, though no studies exist. Fluralaner can be prevented from entry into the environment by owners disposing of animal waste and limiting entry of animals into bodies of water, but if these steps are not followed the environmental effect is entirely unknown.\nAfoxolaner is only available in tablet formulation for dogs. The commercially available monthly dose is 33\u00a0mg (2.2\u00a0mg/kg bw) for a 15\u00a0kg dog (S1), in contrast to the equivalent monthly dose of 167\u00a0mg of fluralaner (500\u00a0mg over 12\u00a0weeks). Afoxolaner is absorbed by treated animals and accumulated in the plasma, with a plasma half-life of ~ 14\u00a0days. It is excreted primarily in the faeces as a mixture of unchanged parent molecule and unspecified hydroxylate and glucuronide metabolites (CVMP 2013). Although the content of dog faeces is a topic of increasing interest, having been recently identified as a substantial source of nitrogen and phosphorus input into peri-urban ecosystems (De Frenne et\u00a0al. 2022), the presence of parasiticides in faeces is not well characterised. There is currently no information available for the concentration of afoxolaner in faeces, nor for its persistence in the environment. (Letendre et\u00a0al. 2014). Toxicity of afoxolaner and its metabolites to animals that may feed on faeces is a further unknown."

As these glutamate-gated chloride channels are not found in mammals, selamectin displays low toxicity towards mammals.

It is not extensively metabolised and is largely excreted unchanged, but the major metabolite present in faeces is O-desmethyl selamectin and its oxidation products. No toxicity data exists on selamectin metabolites but metabolites for avermectins are generally believed to be less toxic than the parent compounds (Lumaret et\u00a0al. 2012).\nSelamectin is available in multiple commercial products, with a monthly dose of 120\u00a0mg (8\u00a0mg/kg bw) for a 15\u00a0kg dog and a mean monthly dose of 37.5\u00a0mg (8.3\u00a0mg/kg) for a 4.5\u00a0kg cat (S1). As with other spot-on parasiticides, selamectin can enter the environment through wash-off from recently treated animals. This risk is mitigated by a recommendation to not let treated animals swim for 2\u00a0h after treatment. It is believed a maximum of 10% of the dose will be available after 2\u00a0h, which would be 12\u00a0mg in a 15\u00a0kg dog. The EPAR for selamectin considers the scenario of a 40-kg dog\nSpecies IC50 (nM) Reference\nAfoxolaner Fluralaner\nAnopheles stephensi 56 (55\u201357) 106.8 (102\u2013118) Miglianico et\u00a0al (2018)\n1 3\nswimming in a 100,000-L body of water at 2\u00a0h after treatment and provides a predicted environmental concentration/ predicted no effect concentration ratio of 0.8, considered acceptable for intermittent exposure (CVMP 2002).

As Lumaret et\u00a0al (2012) note, very little data exists on the ecotoxicity of selamectin apart from that included in the EPAR (Tables\u00a08 and 9). No ecotoxicity studies were identified by this review. The published evidence for the safety of selamectin to non-target species consists of case reports and laboratory studies of its off-label use in exotic pets and captive laboratory specimens. These include the successful use of formulated selamectin (Revolution\u00ae, Pfizer Animal Health) to treat parasite infections at therapeutic doses of 10\u00a0mg/kg bw in rats (Sevimli et\u00a0al. 2009), 12\u00a0mg/ kg bw in Rhesus macaques (Wang et\u00a0al. 2008), 15\u00a0mg/kg in a masked palm civet (Olivieri et\u00a0al 2015), and up to 20\u00a0mg/kg\nbw in rabbits (Carpenter et\u00a0al. 2012), helmeted guineafowl (Hahn et\u00a0al. 2014), and Patagonian cavies (da Cruz Torres Alpino and Kottwitz 2017).\nA single report of Revolution\u00ae used in an amphibian (American bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana) found no adverse effect of topical administration at 6\u00a0mg/kg bw (D'Agostino et\u00a0al. 2007). Further studies on rabbits noted disorganisation of cells and thinning of epithelial tissues (Bozzatto et\u00a0al 2014) and autophagic cell death (Bozzatto et\u00a0al. 2013) after application of a single pipette of Revolution\u00ae at the recommended dose (30\u00a0mg/mL). Signs of mild toxicity were observed in mice after an acute dose of 100\u00a0mg/kg bw (Bishop et\u00a0al. 2000).\nAlthough effects on target-animals were excluded from this literature review, it is interesting to note that certain breeds of dog (typically collies) are more sensitive to ivermectin due to a mutation in the ABCB1 (formerly MDR1) gene. The gene codes for P-glycoprotein which pumps xenobiotics out of cells, but this protein is non-functional in dogs homozygous for the MDR1 mutation (mdr1\u2212/\u2212). This leads to increased permeation of the blood brain barrier by macrocylic lactones and a dose which would be safe in wild-type dogs can cause central nervous system toxicity in mdr1\u2212/\u2212 dogs (Mealey 2008). Although selamectin is known to bind to a P-gp protein (Cel-Pgp-1) in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans (David et\u00a0al. 2016) and accumulates in the brain of mdr1\u2212/\u2212 mice without P-gp, selamectin accumulates to a lesser degree than ivermectin (Geyer et\u00a0al. 2009). The studies included in the regulatory literature advise toxicity was not observed in ivermectin-sensitive dogs given three monthly doses of 30\u00a0mg/kg, 5 \u00d7 the therapeutic dose of 6\u00a0mg/kg (CVMP 2002)."

            "text": "A hazard is something, such as a chemical, with the potential to cause harm. Risk is the likelihood of harm than can be caused by such a hazard, in this case a chemical in certain concentration in the environment. It is now vital to evaluate which parasiticides represent the greatest hazard to our wider environment so that future regulation can correctly weigh costs and benefits. Increasing interest in this area and technical development are leading to field identification and quantification of many environmental pollutants (Egli et\u00a0al. 2021; Perkins et\u00a0al. 2021; Shardlow 2017). Here, we found a limited number of studies addressing toxicity for the commonly used AIs other than imidacloprid and fipronil. Fipronil was more toxic than imidacloprid in almost all comparative studies, except for in the beetle Hippodamia convergens (Kaakeh et\u00a0al. 1996). The magnitude of difference varies among species. For example, Asian honeybee (Apis cerana) adults have a 48-h LD50 of 0.0025\u00a0\u03bcg/bee for fipronil and 0.0036\u00a0\u03bcg/ bee for imidacloprid, suggesting fipronil is more toxic than imidacloprid (Yasuda et\u00a0 al. 2017). Green plant bug (Apolygus lucorum) nymphs have a 48-h LD50 of 0.153\u00a0mg/L for fipronil and 895.416\u00a0mg/L for imidacloprid, indicating a far greater difference in sensitivity to fipronil (Zhang et\u00a0 al. 2015). As there are several recognised pathways (Fig.\u00a01) for parasiticides to enter waterways and static waterbodies, the sensitivity of aquatic species is of particular interest. Fipronil was 2 to 3 orders of magnitude more toxic than imidacloprid in all tested crustacean species (Hano et\u00a0al. 2019; Hook et\u00a0al. 2018; Key et\u00a0al. 2007).\nDespite being sold and used interchangeably, companion animal parasiticide products contain a diverse group of active ingredients from various chemical classes with distinct modes of action, the most commonly used of which have been considered here. As these products are applied in very low doses to indiviudals, little attention has historically been paid to the impact they may be having on the environment. The literature search used in this review was deliberately broad in order to capture the existing evidence on the toxicity and environmental harm of AIs\n1 3\nused in veterinary parasiticides. This evidence was found to be weighted heavily towards imidacloprid and fipronil and most concerns crop pest species and routes of exposure, such as leaf dips and spray treatments that are of limited relevance to the use of companion animal parasiticides. Our conclusion is therefore that the body of evidence does not allow satisfactory characterisation of the environmental risk posed by companion animal parasiticide use for any of the six AIs considered.\nWhere evidence from laboratory assays does exist, the range of experimental setups and endpoints chosen, as well as of test species, makes drawing large-scale conclusions impossible. General trends in toxicity can be observed due to conserved features of species and genera, but there is considerable inter and intra-species variability. Even in mammals, a dose of afoxolaner that is considered safe in rats causes toxicity to cats due to their different metabolic pathways, and doses of selamectin safe in most dogs are toxic to subpopulations with the mdr1\u2212/\u2212 mutation. Therefore, although indicator species are often used for ecotoxicological testing, it is not possible to extrapolate assays from individual species to indicate generalised toxicity of an active ingredient across a genus or at higher taxonomic levels.\nEach of the AIs covered in this review is reasonably safe for vertebrates in their therapeutic doses, and when used as prescribed, due to their selective toxicity, but their safety in relation to non-target invertebrates is less clear. Imidacloprid and fipronil show lower toxicity towards the typical ecotoxicity test species but are acutely toxic to many aquatic organisms. This is known, but not specifically acknowledged in the marketing authorisation for imidacloprid spot-on products. For afoxolaner and fluralaner, the complete lack of ecotoxicity studies severely limits any judgements about their environmental safety, though fluralaner is confirmed toxic to D. magna (CVMP 2017). Selamectin is also acutely toxic to D. magna, but as the regulatory assumption is that the environmental exposure to these AIs is negligible, no other toxicity studies have been required (CVMP 2013; 2016, 2002). As these AIs display differential toxicity against the wide range of recognised companion animal parasites, they are often used in combination to achieve full prophylactic coverage, or for treatment of co-infected animals. Non-target species are thus likely to be exposed simultaneously to multiple active ingredients with disparate modes of action, which may increase their susceptibility and environmental risk.\nA lack of safety studies is justifiable if there is negligible risk of parasiticides entering the environment, but with millions of doses sold in the UK every year and any mitigation methods reliant on pet owner compliance and cooperation, this is unlikely. For example, Bravecto\u00ae application is advised every 12\u00a0weeks, and in human\nmedicine, information leaflets for repeat medications are fully read by only 25% of patients, though 75.5% of these patients did read the leaflet when first taking the medication (Nathan et\u00a0al. 2007). A risk mitigation measure that relies on the public remembering a message they may have read > 12\u00a0weeks ago, or not at all, is clearly not sufficient to prevent active ingredients entering the environment. Indeed, increasing research into the environmental pollution of freshwater bodies (Miller et\u00a0al. 2019) provides evidence that imidacloprid, fipronil, and fipronil metabolites have been found in water in areas where an agricultural-use source is extremely unlikely (Perkins et\u00a0al. 2021). Treated dogs bathing or swimming can induce continuous low-level exposure, such as that indicated by the steady levels of fipronil found by Sadaria et\u00a0al. (2017) in Californian wastewater. The use of fipronil in California may not be identical to that of the UK, though fipronil in companion animal parasiticide treatment is considered a likely source (Sadaria et\u00a0al. 2016). In addition to specific safety studies, field community level studies will be needed to explore alterations in insect population structures and dynamics, especially in vulnerable waterways.\nThe harmful impacts of parasiticides used on companion animals on the environment are of increasing concern. Eventual legislative assessment of environmental risks is hampered by substantial gaps in the information for exposures (concentrations in different environmental compartments) as well as hazards (as discussed in the present paper). Although the environmental impact of a single dose of parasiticide is small, millions of doses are used both in the UK and elsewhere. This level of companion animal parasiticide usage calls for an in-depth regulatory investigation of their environmental risks and an updating of the marketing authorisation procedure,\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11356- 022- 20204-2.\nAcknowledgements We wish to thank Dr Andrew Prentis BVSc MRCVS who drew our attention to this growing challenge.
