    "abstractText": "Background Lowering the strength of alcohol products could lead to less alcohol being bought and drunk. In its prevention White Paper, the UK Government aims to promote a significant increase in the availability of alcohol-free and low-alcohol products by 2025. Methods Through descriptive analysis and ARIMA modelling of >4 million alcohol purchases from 69 803 British households, we study the potential impact of lower strength alcohol products in reducing household purchases of grams of alcohol over 2015\u20132019. Households are divided into predominantly beer, wine or spirits purchasers. Results Over 5 years, there were decreases in purchases of grams of alcohol within beer amongst beer-purchasing households and increases in purchases of grams of alcohol within wine and spirits amongst, respectively, wineand spirits-purchasing households. Almost all the changes were due to beer-purchasing households buying less regular strength beer, and wine and spirits-purchasing households buying, respectively, more regular strength wine and spirits, rather than increases in purchases of noand low-alcohol products. Conclusions In general, lower strength alcohol products have not contributed to British households buying fewer grams of alcohol over the 5-year follow-up period during 2015\u20132019.",

In its prevention White Paper, the\nUK Government aims to promote a significant increase in the availability of alcohol-free and low-alcohol products by 2025.\nMethods Through descriptive analysis and ARIMA modelling of >4 million alcohol purchases from 69 803 British households, we study the\npotential impact of lower strength alcohol products in reducing household purchases of grams of alcohol over 2015\u20132019. Households are\ndivided into predominantly beer, wine or spirits purchasers.\nResults Over 5 years, there were decreases in purchases of grams of alcohol within beer amongst beer-purchasing households and increases in\npurchases of grams of alcohol within wine and spirits amongst, respectively, wine- and spirits-purchasing households. Almost all the changes\nwere due to beer-purchasing households buying less regular strength beer, and wine and spirits-purchasing households buying, respectively,\nmore regular strength wine and spirits, rather than increases in purchases of no- and low-alcohol products.\nConclusions In general, lower strength alcohol products have not contributed to British households buying fewer grams of alcohol over the\n5-year follow-up period during 2015\u20132019.\nKeywords public health, alcohol consumption, behaviour"

            "text": "The ethanol in alcoholic beverages is toxic to many bodily systems,1\u20135 is genotoxic and is a carcinogen.6,7 Worldwide, alcohol is a cause of 7.1% of all deaths amongst those aged 69 years or less, 2 million deaths a year, with the three top causes of alcohol-related death being cirrhosis of the liver, road injuries and tuberculosis.8\nThe key to reducing the harm caused by ethanol is to drink less alcohol.9 People can be encouraged to drink less alcohol by making alcohol more expensive, decreasing its availability, banning its advertising, putting in place strict drink-driving laws and providing advice, support and treatment to reduce consumption.10 An additional measure would be to have less ethanol in alcoholic beverages,11 following models of less salt12 and less sugar13 in drink and food products. Indeed, in its consultation document, \u2018Advancing our health: prevention\nin the 2020s,\u2019 whilst not without its critics,14 the UK Government made a commitment to work with the drinks industry to \u2018deliver a significant increase in the availability of alcohol-free and low-alcohol products by 2025\u2019.15\nUsing the same dataset as the present paper and analyzing the specificities of lower strength beer products, we have previously shown that the introduction of new no- and lowalcohol beers in Great Britain and the reformulation of existing beers to contain less alcohol during 2015\u20132018 resulted in households purchasing fewer grams of alcohol overall16; reductions were greater for the reformulation of existing\nic.oup.com /jpubhealth/article/44/4/e567/6573750 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nproducts than for the introduction of new no- and lowalcohol products. However, we still lack definitive evidence to answer the bigger question; are lower strength alcohol products, including those beyond beer, and beyond newly introduced products,16 making a dent in the total amount of alcohol (expressed as grams of ethanol) bought and consumed in Great Britain?\nIn this paper, we examine British (English, Scottish and Welsh) household purchases of alcohol over the years 2015\u2013 2019. We exclude 2020 data from the analyses, as household purchases of alcohol were unusually high due to foregone purchases from on-license premises, such as pubs, bars and restaurants that were closed due to COVID-19 mitigation measures.17,18\nSince it is at the level of the household that purchases are recorded, we are interested in examining the extent to which the household shopping basket of purchases of alcohol, including no- and low-alcohol products, changes at the level of the household over time. We consider if changes differ between households that are predominantly beer-purchasing, wine-purchasing and spirits-purchasing (these 3 groups of products being responsible for about 90% of all grams of ethanol purchased at the household level).19 We ask the following two questions:\n1. Up to a maximum follow-up time of 5 years, do individual household purchases of grams of alcohol decrease, remain stable or increase over time? 2. If individual household purchases decrease over time, what is the potential contribution of lower strength products to such decreases, and does the contribution differ by geographical region of Great Britain (Scotland, Wales and regions of England)?\nMethods\nStudy design\nWe undertake descriptive analyses of the changes in purchases of grams of alcohol at the household level over time. We use ARIMA regression analyses to explore potential contributory factors to identified changes in purchases.\nData source\nOur data source is Kantar Worldpanel\u2019s (KWP) household shopping panel.16\u201320 KWP comprises \u223c30 000 British households at any one time, recruited via stratified sampling, with targets set for region, household size, age of main shopper and occupational group, with the panel being\nrepresentative of households in Great Britain as a whole.19 Households provide demographic information when joining the panel, followed by annual updates and quality checks.21 Using barcode scanners, households record all alcohol purchases brought into the home from all store types, including Internet shopping.\nWe analysed raw KWP data on take-home purchasing of alcohol products in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) for the years 2015\u20132019. The data we obtained had no missing values, except for household income, for which just over one in six households (15.7%) did not provide household income data, with this proportion roughly constant over the 5 years. We imputed the missing income data using monotonic multiple imputation.22 Alcohol purchases are recorded daily. For each individual purchase, the data include the type and volume of the purchase, the brand, the alcohol by volume (ABV) and the price paid. The volume purchased was combined with ABV to calculate grams of alcohol purchased. We classified households by a range of sociodemographic groups (see Supplement, page 1).23\u201326\nFor each household, we set the first day of a recorded alcohol purchase as Day 1, and numbered days sequentially onwards until the last day of a recorded alcohol purchase. We prepared data for each day of follow-up by, first, for any day that a household bought alcohol, summing the amount of alcohol purchased in both volume and grams, divided by the number of adults in the household. Then, for each day of follow-up, we calculated the mean volume and grams of purchases across all households for each of six categories of products: beers; ciders; wines; spirits; fortified wines and liqueurs and ready-to-drinks. For each day of follow-up, we also calculated the mean ABV and the mean price in GB pence paid per millilitre (ml) of purchased beers, wines and spirits.\nWe grouped each of the six categories of products by ABV27 (see Supplementary Table 1, page 1)."

Since the calculations of volumes and grams purchased are based on days when a household made an alcohol purchase, we plot frequencies of purchases, calculated at the household level as the number of days between any one purchase and its subsequent purchase.\nFor each cluster of households, using a generalized linear model, we present odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for household characteristics by predominant beverage purchased (beers, wines and spirits). We describe changes in purchases of grams of alcohol and of volume purchased (ml), and changes in ABV over time.\nFor each cluster of households (beer, wine or sprits), we use ARIMA modelling to estimate the standardized coefficients and 95% confidence intervals for the associations of changes over time between four independent variables (standardized values of purchases of volume of zero alcohol product, of low-alcohol product, and of all other regular strength products, and ABV of purchased regular strength products) and the dependent variable, standardized values of purchases of grams of alcohol within beer, wine or spirits, depending on the household cluster.

Spirits-purchasing households tended to be older, more socioeconomically disadvantaged and more likely to be from Scotland and the north of England.\nFor beer-purchasing households, there was a small reduction in purchases of grams of alcohol in beer over the time, matched by similar decreases in purchases of all grams of alcohol, Table 1, rows 8\u20139, and Fig. 1 (top graph). For beer-purchasing households, purchases of grams of alcohol in wine and spirits remained fairly stable over the time of follow-up.\nFor wine-purchasing households, there was a slight increase in purchases of grams of alcohol in wine over time, paralleled by a slight increase in purchases of all grams of alcohol, Fig. 1 (middle graph). For wine-purchasing households, purchases of grams of alcohol in beer and spirits remained fairly low, with a very slight increase in grams of alcohol in spirits over time.\nFor spirits-purchasing households, there was a steady increase in purchases of grams of alcohol in spirits over time, paralleled by a steady increase in purchases of all grams of alcohol, Fig. 1 (bottom graph). For spirits-purchasing households, purchases of grams of alcohol in beer and wine remained fairly low and steady over time.\nOver time, the ABV of beer purchased by beer-purchasing households decreased very slightly, whereas it remained stable for spirits amongst spirits-purchasing households and increased very slightly for wine amongst wine-purchasing households, Table 1, row 41.

For Great Britain for 2015\u2013 2019, there were positive standardized coefficients between changes in the purchase volume and ABV of the regular product over time and changes in purchases of grams of alcohol within beer, wines and spirits. For beers and wines, there were also positive associations between volume of purchases of low-alcohol products and numbers of grams of alcohol purchased over time. For beers, was there a small negative association between volumes of no-alcohol beers purchased and numbers of grams of alcohol purchased within beer, present in the north of England, but not the south. For wines, was there a small negative association between volumes of noalcohol wines purchased and numbers of grams of alcohol purchased within wine, for the years of 2015 and 2019, but not for other years. The standardized coefficients, which place the coefficients on the same scale, indicate that, by far, the main driver of decreases in purchases of grams of alcohol in beers, and increases in wines and spirits across Great Britain was decreases in purchases of the volume of regular strength beers and increases in the volumes of regular strength wines and spirits.\nThe first sensitivity analysis, which restricted analysis to the years 2017\u20132019, found slightly different, but similar sized coefficients. The second sensitivity analysis (which\nincluded the first 365 days within each separate calendar year (2015\u20132019)) also found slightly different, but similar sized coefficients for each of the 5 years. For calendar years 2015 and 2019, there was a (very small) negative association between volumes of no-alcohol wines purchased and numbers of grams of alcohol purchased within wine.\nThe patterns were similar by country (Scotland and Wales) and regions of England, with one exception: in the northern (but, not in the southern) regions of England, there were, albeit very small, negative coefficients between purchases of zero alcohol beer and purchases of grams of alcohol within beer.\nChanges in price over time were not associated with changes in the volumes of regular products purchased, see Supplement page 17 and Supplementary Fig. 17."

For wine purchasing households, there was an association between an increase in purchases of no-alcohol wine during each of 2015 and 2019 and decreases in purchases of grams of alcohol in all wine over time, again with very small-sized coefficients. As the ABV of beer decreased, purchases of grams of alcohol in beer decreased to a small extent, and as the ABV of wines and spirits increased, purchases of grams of alcohol in wines and spirits, respectively, increased to a small extent. For each cluster of households, by far the largest driver in changes in purchases of grams of alcohol was changes in the volume of regular strength products over time.\nWhat is already known on this topic\nWe are not aware of any other similar studies that have analysed the overall contribution of lower strength products to household purchases of alcohol over time. Elsewhere, we have analysed specificities of the impact of newly introduced lower strength beer products on beer purchases, rather than the broader picture of household alcohol purchases presented in this paper. For example, through interrupted time series analyses, we have shown that the introduction of new noand low-alcohol beers leads to replacement purchases from higher strength beers, and thus purchases of fewer grams of alcohol,16 with such purchases of new products greater amongst younger and more socioeconomically advantaged households compared with other groups.27 We have also demonstrated that pricing policy,30 including setting a minimum price per gram of alcohol sold, favours shifts to buying lower strength beers.31 However as these latest findings highlight, the problems are that the contribution of no-alcohol products is mostly restricted to beers (and thus to beer purchasing households), with some, much smaller, contribution from no-alcohol wines and that the volume of sales of noalcohol beers and wines, although increasing, remains very low as a proportion of all products sold.\nWhat this study adds\nThe purchases of grams of alcohol within beer decreased over time almost entirely because households bought less regular strength beer, and purchases of grams of alcohol within wines and spirits increased over time because household bought more wines and spirits, with the volumes purchased over time not associated with changes in price over time. For beer, there were very small contributions to reduced purchases of grams of alcohol within beer from no-alcohol products in the north of England, and for wine to reduced purchases of grams of alcohol within wine from no-alcohol wine purchases during 2015 and 2019."

            "heading": "Limitations of the study",
            "text": "One limitation of our study, which is based on over four million separate alcohol purchases from 69 803 households, is that there is a drop off in the number of households providing follow-up data over time (Supplementary Figs 13\u2013 15, supplement pages 16\u201318). A further key limitation is that we only measure off-trade alcohol purchases and not ontrade purchases. By way of example, for Great Britain, offtrade purchases increased from 69.4% of all alcohol purchases (expressed in volume of absolute alcohol) in 2015 to 72.7% in 2019, with off-trade purchases of beer increasing from 45.6% in 2015 to 53.6% in 2019.32 The data also have\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jpubhealth/article/44/4/e567/6573750 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nlimitations, with heavy drinkers tending to be underrepresented in household panel data,33 and with alcohol purchases tending to be underreported in these datasets.34,35 In addition, we are only able to assess changes in off-trade alcohol purchases as opposed to actual levels of alcohol consumption for these time periods. Adults in a household may not have an equal share of the alcohol purchased, and not all adults in a household may be drinkers of alcohol."

            "text": "Lower strength alcohol products have not contributed in any significant way to British households buying fewer grams of alcohol over a 5-year follow-up period during the years 2015\u20132019. The potential public health contribution of lower strength alcohol products11,16 remains an underresearched area.36 To reap any public health benefit of lower strength alcohol products, governments would need to introduce pricing policies that favour buying and drinking lower strength products,30,31 supported by improved product labelling36 and social norms campaigns.37 Governments should also enforce stepped-up action by the alcohol industry to produce lower strength products that goes beyond voluntary commitments,38 and any actions to date,39 ensuring that noalcohol products are not used to circumvent brand-specific advertising of alcohol.40"
