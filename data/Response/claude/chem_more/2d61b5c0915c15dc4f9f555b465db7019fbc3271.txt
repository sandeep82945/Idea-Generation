 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading the paper:

1. Use mass spectrometry to verify the identity of the compounds tentatively identified by HPLC in the herbal extracts. This will provide more definitive confirmation of the chemical composition. 

2. Expand the fingerprinting methods to additional medicinal plants, particularly other native Latvian species, to continue building a database of chromatographic profiles.

3. Investigate how growing conditions (soil, climate, etc.) impact the chemical fingerprints of the medicinal plants. This could help identify optimal cultivation methods.

4. Develop chemometric models to quantitatively predict the composition of herbal extract mixtures based on the chromatographic fingerprints. This would aid quality control.

5. Evaluate the biological and pharmacological activities of the herbal extracts and identify correlations with components of the chemical fingerprints. This could reveal active compounds.
