1. **Investigate the long-term effects of EWV interventions on child wellbeing and resilience.** This could be done by following up with the same sample of children over time to see how their wellbeing and resilience change as they grow older. This would help to determine whether the positive effects of EWV are sustained over time.


2. **Explore the role of EWV in promoting child wellbeing in different contexts.** This could be done by conducting similar studies in different countries or regions with different cultural, economic, and political contexts. This would help to determine whether the positive effects of EWV are generalizable to other settings.


3. **Examine the cost-effectiveness of EWV interventions.** This could be done by comparing the costs of EWV interventions to the benefits they produce in terms of improved child wellbeing. This would help to determine whether EWV is a cost-effective way to promote child wellbeing.


4. **Develop and test new EWV interventions that are tailored to the specific needs of different populations.** This could be done by working with local communities to develop interventions that are culturally appropriate and responsive to the specific challenges they face. This would help to ensure that EWV interventions are effective in promoting child wellbeing in a variety of settings.


5. **Advocate for the inclusion of EWV interventions in national and international policies and programs.** This could be done by working with governments, NGOs, and other stakeholders to raise awareness of the benefits of EWV and to advocate for its inclusion in policies and programs that promote child wellbeing. This would help to ensure that EWV interventions are available to a wider range of children and families.
