SMEs\u2019 employment statistics and future worker\nneeds make it a focus of policies among rising economies, and Pakistan\nis no exception. The working conditions in SMEs diverge from industry to\nindustry; however, irrespective of the industrial categorization, the SMEs\nare failing to protect the workers\u2019 rights in the perspective of Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs). The interpretivism paradigm and purposive\nsampling, narrative inquiry, and analysis method have been adopted to gain\nin-depth knowledge of workers\u2019 rights in SMEs concerning the SDGs. Results\nrevealed that Pakistan-based SMEs argue to be financially weak and perceived\nas less equipped to adhere to the world\u2019s standards. Highlighted issues in\nfailure to adhere to worker\u2019s rights include lack of financial resources, top\nmanagement\u2019s commitment, regulatory framework, SDG awareness, strategic\nplanning, and the dire need for expert guidance and consultation in translating\ngoals to work environments.\nKEYWORDS\nSMEs, labor rights, industries, sustainability, Sustainable Development Goals\nIntroduction\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are a significant engine of financial expansion and socioeconomic advancement (Taylor and Murphy, 2004; Najeeb, 2021). SMEs include all private sector small and medium-sized industries, businesses and economic entities (Durst and Runar Edvardsson, 2012). SMEs have a vital role\nFrontiers in Psychology 01 frontiersin.org\nin implementing the plan set under Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Verboven and Vanherck, 2016) as this sector creates jobs that diminish unemployment and poverty at a lower level. The SMEs have generated 90% of new positions in the formal sector (Razak et al., 2018; Joan et al., 2022). Accordingly, the World Bank report has also pointed out that in the future, 600 million jobs will be required to take up the emergent worldwide workforce needs, mainly in Asia and sub-Saharan African regions, where annual growth rates may exceed 2.7% (World Bank, 2019).\nThe SMEs are captivating a prominence in fulfilling the business-linked SDGs for sustainable economic growth for decent work and generating a constructive shove for an elevated worth of living, education, and health for all. These enterprises significantly contribute to poverty reduction, particularly in the rural areas for uneducated but skilled men and women. They support low-income families to run their expenditures by earning at a small level (World Bank, 2019). The SDGs demand converting plans with systemic modification in financial markets and institutions work (World Bank, 2019).\nIn Pakistan, there were 5.2 million SMEs reported last year in the press (Najeeb, 2021). These SMEs make up nearly 90% of exclusive private businesses. These enterprises contain manufacturing units, service suppliers, and startups working at different stages. The SMEs use 78% of the non-agricultural workforce, accounting for 25% of manufacturing exports and 30% of Pakistan\u2019s GDP (Shah and Syed, 2018). The Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority (SMEDA) was inaugurated in 1998 for SMEs support and smooth progress. It is not just an SME policy-advisory institute for the government, excluding facilitating the vision of other stakeholders in dealing with their SME growth schema. The SMEs in Pakistan are lowincome enterprises with fewer employees with less attention to SDGs, and only a few have adopted some SDGs-related agenda items (Subhan et al., 2013). In the absence of these agenda points\u2019 implementation, the enterprises face numerous issues. If these enterprises adopt and implement these agenda items in the workplace, it would undoubtedly support their growth and workers in the workplace with ultimate benefits to the owners and further contribute to the national economy in Pakistan. Shah and Syed (2018) reported that SMEs do approximately 30% of the export in Pakistan, contributing 40% share of the total GDP of Pakistan. The SMEs also positively impact people\u2019s lives as this sector provides them economic opportunities for earning and fulfilling their financial needs.\nPakistan has been a signatory of SDG 2030 from its beginning in 2015 (Qazi, 2021). The National Assembly of Pakistan adopted these goals in February 2016 and became the first country who adopts SDGs in 2030. Pakistan\u2019s 12th 5 years plan and provincial level strategies were developed aligned with these SDGs. Seven SDG support units were established at the\nfederal and provincial levels to enhance collaboration among the different government departments and non-government stakeholders to progress toward SDG 2030 (Qazi, 2021). This research aims to understand why SMEs management in Pakistan cannot fulfill the workers\u2019 rights required by SDG 2030. Are they willing to contribute their role toward the achievement of SDG 2030? Is the government supporting SMEs to provide workers\u2019 rights? It explored how SDGs developed on the international level are implemented in SMEs in Pakistan. Primarily, there is very less research seeking the applicability of SDGs on the SMEs for the worker\u2019s rights, and hence, this article will contribute remarkably to the existing knowledge."

Their qualitative thematic analysis of Sialkot-based SMEs produced five interrelated themes of CSR barricades: lack of resources and policies required top management\u2019s pledge, need for CSR information, and inactive buyer behavior (Islam et al., 2021; Rehmani et al., 2022a,b). Zou et al. (2021) analyzed that resource limitations are the key barrier preventing SMEs from being affianced by CSR actions. Through responsiveness to obstructions, policymakers and experts can take the required measures to develop CSR applications in SMEs. Organizations can gain a competitive edge in emerging markets, so focusing on CSR and corporate social performance is necessary (Cris\u0327anMitra et al., 2020). Lotfi et al. (2021) and Hamid et al. (2021) both revealed that many supply chains have the assurance to avoid the abuse of workers\u2019 rights, an essential part of social sustainability in their distant supply chains. They have provided a way to recognize how supply chains do not defeat the infringement of labor\u2019s rights by adopting the UN suggested SDGs on the social basis of the \u201cdoughnut model\u201d regarding labor rights in supply chains. They have developed the \u201csustainable supply chain doughnut model\u201d regarding the SDGs, through which they have investigated the breach of labor rights. A study by La\u030cza\u030croiu et al. (2020a) focused on green public procurement driving the economy as an environment policy mechanism for sustainable goods and services.\nA similar study by Ullah et al. (2021) gave an understanding of how government enticement (economic and non-economic) manipulates green modernism and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) association in SMEs. The research suggested that SMEs focus on implementing green modernization and technology to keep the surroundings and ease society. The results of this empirical study of 204 Pakistani SMEs pointed out that green concepts have an essential sway on SDGs, public growth, and environmental behaviors.\nFrontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org\nFurthermore, government support significantly strengthens the relationship between green innovation and environmental practices, while it does not moderate the path between green innovation and community development. Moreover, the government must financially support the SMEs, so that SMEs may facilitate the labor and workers by implementing the SDGs. Corporate governance systems of organizations shape operational environmental sustainability (La\u030cza\u030croiu et al., 2020b; Rehmani et al., 2020).\nIn this study, we explore the failure of SMEs Management to fill the worker\u2019s rights as required by SDG 2030. According to the International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions illustrated, workers\u2019 rights research defines it by using the terms \u201cfreedom of association, collective bargaining, the abolition of forced or compulsory labor, equality of opportunity and treatment in employment and occupation, protection of children and young persons, wages, working hours, safety, and the legal employment relationship.\u201d We have studied SMEs\u2019 workers\u2019 rights in Pakistan following the SDGs agenda 2030. We explore among the 17 goals directly related to workers\u2019 rights, and SMEs can contribute to it. We studied why SME management has failed to fulfill the workers\u2019 rights required by these related SDGs. How these workers\u2019 rights can be secured; to what extent the government may support SMEs; and how can these SMEs support Pakistan\u2019s national economic growth?\nThe SMEs are enterprises with low budgets that contribute to the country\u2019s economy. There appears to be no universally accepted definition of SMEs. The SMEs definitions are still confusing concepts as they vary. For example, SMEs have less than 500 workers in France. The description may vary according to the kind of business in Japan, where mining, manufacturing, shipping, and building industries are defined as SMEs with less than 300 workers. In Ghana, SMEs are defined as an enterprise with an annual income of \u201c23,700\u20132,370,000\u201d dollars (Gibson and Van der Vaart, 2008). In Thailand, gross national income (GNI) per capita is five times higher than Ghana; SMEs are considered companies that generate income from 84,400 to 8,440,000 dollars. Tables 1, 2 shows the definitions described by different countries, such as, Germany, Belgium, United Nations and Canada. This helps understand the criteria used by various institutions globally.\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises in Pakistani milieu\nNo standardized description of SMEs exists in Pakistan (Dar et al., 2017). The \u201cSME Bank, SMEDA, Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), and State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) all have defined SMEs differently. The PBS accepts an SME based on employee enrollment, while the SBP\u2019s description of the SME is the nature of the business and the number of employees. The SME bank has elaborated many assets as the standard. In schedule 05 to Companies Ordinance 2015, the Security and"

Rohra and Panhwar (2009) mentioned that most developed states grant SMEs\u2019 significance in supporting their economy. SMEs have a vital role in the growth as it has been a source of job creation and revenue. Pakistan-based SMEs play a critical role in economic development and technological innovation. SMEs are playing a part in poverty reduction and increasing the state economy. In Pakistan\u2019s financial system, these enterprises are uplifting employment. Like other developing nations, the state economy directly impacts the SME sector (Khalique et al., 2011). According to the Economic Census of Pakistan 2020, the GDP growth is 3.94% against the visualized target of 2.1%, transmittals have made remarkable records, and exports are touching 25 billion dollars in the extroverted financial year.

In Group 1, all the goals directly related to workers\u2019 rights in SMEs are included. Group 2 consists of the SDGs that are related to the environment. In Group 3, only SDGs associated with the ideal layer are included in Group 1.\nGroup 1 SDG 1: Poverty reduction in all its forms and domains. SDG 2: Hunger reduction, food security, and promote sustainable agriculture. SDG 3: Guarantee health services and endorse wellbeing plans for all age groups.

SDG 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy to all. SDG 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation. SDG 13: Take urgent actions to combat climate change and its impact. SDG 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development. SDG 15: Protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably managed forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss.\nGroup 3 SDG 11: Sustainable city and community. SDG 12: Insurance of sustainable consumption and production patterns. Our primary focus in this study is the goals given in Group 1. The workers\u2019 rights studied concerning the objectives given in Group 1 include basic needs, health, education, income and work, peace and justice, social parity, gender egalitarianism, and networks."

The purposive sampling technique is used to select the respondents, as Abbas and Hafeez (2021). We contacted the management of SMEs from surgical, leather, and sports goods to ask why the failure to fulfill the workers\u2019 rights in the Context of SDG 2030. These respondents were CEOs, GMs, and managers. The researchers know these professionals personally. The data were collected through interviews conducted via phone and physically. After collecting data, narrative analysis was used to analyze it (Abbas and Hafeez, 2021). The sample size is limited as few interviews of wellknown acquaintances provided the necessary details to conduct the narrative analysis. Collecting and analyzing the information shared by people help describe different experiences and offer their interpretations.

The majority of interviewees shared that they are willing to provide all the rights to their workers as required by SDGs, but due to the limited financial resources, they are unable to fulfill this requirement:\n\u201cBeing an export-oriented SME, we have different challenges. Our operations are order-based, and price competition is very\nhigh, so we find it difficult to provide all the rights to the workers.

All our workers are earning enough to meet their personal and family needs. We have the piece-rate workers, which means more work we have more they do and make more. However, a small organization can\u2019t afford to fulfill all their rights due to the non-availability of funds as our profit margins are meager.\u201d SME 7\n\u201cIt seems very hard to provide all the workers\u2019 rights required by the International Standards. Registration with Social Security, EOBI, paying them for annual, sick, casual and maternity leaves, paying the overtime on premium rates and providing them health and safety facilities all need money beyond the affordability of a small organization.\u201d SME 7\nThe respondents expressed that if they have enough financial resources, they will provide all the rights to their workers and try to perform their role to achieve the SGDs 2030.

SMEs in Pakistan work on a low budget and hardly afford sustainable development agenda in their workplace for laborers. Still, despite size and income, all shareholders, employees, and customers expect a similar pledge to sustainability from all small and medium businesses (Iftikhar et al., 2021). Being small can be an advantage, it usually means being additional supple and able to make arrangements quickly. In Pakistan, there are some limitations of financial assistance, low budget and income, lack of top management commitment, regulatory framework, less or no SDG knowledge, lack of strategic planning for workers, and SDGs related to workers\u2019 rights implementation complexity (Zaman et al., 2022).
