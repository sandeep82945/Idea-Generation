    "abstractText": "Background Chronic refractory wounds easily relapse and seriously affect the patients\u2019 quality of life. Previous studies have shown that stromal vascular fraction gel (SVF-gel) significantly promotes the early healing of chronic wounds; however, the mechanisms of SVF-gel function per se remain unclear, and a long-term follow-up is lacking. This study aims to explore the mechanisms of SVF-gel promoting the healing of chronic wounds and follow up the long-term efficacy of SVF-gel. Methods Autologous SVF-gel transplantation was performed in 20 patients with chronic wounds (from March 2016 to September 2019), and the size of the wound before and after SVF-gel transplantation was observed. The conditioned medium (CM) was harvested from SVF-gel under serum-free, serum-deprivation and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) microenvironment in vitro, respectively. The concentration of the growth factors in the two kinds of gel-CM was tested, and their effects on the proliferation and migration of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) were detected. Results All patients had 100% wound closure eventually, and the average time to complete closure was 28.3 \u00b1 9.7 days. The time of follow-up ranged from 2 to 6 years, and there was no wound recurrence. Interestingly, the concentrations of epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor \u03b21 of the CM were higher in serum-free and serum-deprivation condition than in 10% FBS microenvironment (p < 0.05). Correspondingly, the proliferation and migration ability of HDFs treated with gel-CM from serum-free condition were stronger than those treated with gelCM from serum-deprivation (2% FBS) or 10% FBS microenvironment (p < 0.05). Conclusion These results indicate that it is safe, effective, and lasting in effect to treat chronic wounds with SVF-gel and mechanisms of action that include secreting various cytokines and promoting cell proliferation and migration",

The conditioned medium (CM) was harvested from SVF-gel under serum-free, serum-deprivation and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) microenvironment in vitro, respectively. The concentration of the growth factors in the two kinds of gel-CM was tested, and their effects on the proliferation and migration of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) were detected.\nResults All patients had 100% wound closure eventually, and the average time to complete closure was 28.3 \u00b1 9.7 days. The time of follow-up ranged from 2 to 6 years, and there was no wound recurrence. Interestingly, the concentrations of epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor \u03b21 of the CM were higher in serum-free and serum-deprivation condition than in 10% FBS microenvironment (p < 0.05). Correspondingly, the proliferation and migration ability of HDFs treated with gel-CM from serum-free condition were stronger than those treated with gelCM from serum-deprivation (2% FBS) or 10% FBS microenvironment (p < 0.05).\nConclusion These results indicate that it is safe, effective, and lasting in effect to treat chronic wounds with SVF-gel and mechanisms of action that include secreting various cytokines and promoting cell proliferation and migration ability.\nTrial registration: Chinese Clinical Trail Registry, ChiCTR2000034624.

            "text": "Chronic refractory wounds refer to wounds that fail to achieve timely structural and functional integrity after standard clinical treatment and thus develop into a state of chronic pathological inflammation. With the aging of the population and the improvement of living quality, the incidence of chronic wounds, which are common in diseases such as diabetes, venous stasis ulcers, pressure sores, deep burns and systemic sclerosis, has been continuously increasing [1]. Thus, the treatment of chronic wounds has become a major problem for plastic surgeons and affects the quality of life and economic burden of patients. To date, there is no satisfactory treatment method for chronic wounds.\nRecently, stem cell therapy has attracted much attention in the treatment of chronic wounds by regulating wound inflammation and promoting wound vascularization and epithelization. Adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) is a mixed cell population other than mature adipocytes in adipose tissue, including adiposederived stem cells (ASCs)\u2014the major components, adipose precursor cells, macrophages, endothelial cells, and pericytes [2]. ASCs are currently the most widely used type of mesenchymal stem cells due to their wide sources, rich content, and easy access. Several studies suggest that ASCs have therapeutic potential in the treatment of chronic wounds. Not only can ASCs differentiate into a variety of cells needed for wound repair, such as epidermal cells and endothelial cells, but they also have a powerful paracrine function and can secrete a variety of cytokines and growth factors to promote wound angiogenesis and epidermal regeneration [3\u20137]. However, the optimal cell delivery method of ASCs has still not been effectively determined [8]. Moreover, the separation of ASCs requires digestion using heterogeneous collagenases, which increases the risk of biological contamination; its cultivation and purification also require specific laboratory equipment and personnel. These factors limit the further application of ASCs in clinical practice.\nThe stromal vascular fraction gel (SVF-gel) is a highconcentration product rich in extracellular matrix (ECM) and SVF cells obtained through purely physical methods [9]. Its preparation does not require the use of heterogeneous collagenase digestion, which reduces the risk of biological contamination. Moreover, compared with SVF suspension, SVF-gel shows a better therapeutic effect in the treatment of wound models in nude mice [9]. Our previous studies found that conditioned medium (CM) from SVF-gel accelerates wound healing in rats [10, 11].\nHowever, the interference of serum was not eliminated when the culture medium was obtained, while several studies have shown that serum affects the paracrine function of stem cells [12, 13]. Subsequently, our clinical cases showed that SVF-gel significantly promoted chronic wound healing by promoting angiogenesis and collagen regeneration compared with negative pressure wound treatment [14]. However, long-term efficacy observation is lacking, while chronic refractory wounds were easy to relapse.\nIn the present study, we explored the mechanism of SVF-gel promoting wound healing without the interference of serum and further confirmed the clinical efficacy of SVF-gel in treating chronic wounds by extending the follow-up time."

The volume of the SVF-gel used was depended on the area of the wound, and the ratio was approximately 0.25\u00a0mL/ cm2. Approximately three-fourths of the prepared SVFgel was directly injected into the wound bed and edge of the wound, and the remaining gel was used to cover the surface of the wound. Then, the wound was covered with sterile saline gauze. In general, the dressing was changed every 2\u20133\u00a0days and the wound was again enclosed with physiological saline gauze to retain moisture. As for outpatients, they returned weekly for wound inspections. Wound photographs from each subject at different treatment periods were obtained by a digital camera (Canon,\nJapan).

The results showed that compared with that of the 10% FBS group,\nthe gel-CM from the serum-deprived medium produced more EGF (19.40 \u00b1 5.66\u00a0 pg/mL vs. 26.27 \u00b1 4.01\u00a0 pg/mL) and TGF-\u03b21 (154.20 \u00b1 27.13\u00a0pg/mL vs. 191.94 \u00b1 15.54\u00a0pg/ mL) (P < 0.05), while the expression of bFGF (2,037.17 \u00b1 254.06\u00a0 pg/mL vs. 2,164.89 \u00b1 233.66\u00a0 pg/mL) and VEGF (59.56 \u00b1 8.16\u00a0 pg/mL vs. 58.58 \u00b1 4.45\u00a0 pg/mL) (P > 0.05) was not significantly different (Fig.\u00a04A).\nEffect of\u00a0the\u00a0gel\u2011CM on\u00a0the\u00a0migration and\u00a0proliferation of\u00a0the\u00a0HDFs The fast migration of fibroblasts is an essential step for wound healing. To further examine whether the gel-CM could promote dermal fibroblast migration, we performed the wound scratch assay (Fig.\u00a0 4B). The results showed that dermal fibroblasts treated with gel-CM from serum-free medium had better migration ability and the wound was covered significantly faster at 24\u00a0 h after scratching compared with that treated with standard medium or serum-deprivation medium, suggesting that the gel-CM accelerated the dermal fibroblast migration and it worked better in serum-free condition, as shown in Fig.\u00a04B and C. Additionally, we further quantified the scratch wound area and found a statistically significant increase in the fibroblast migration rate in the gel-CMtreated group. To confirm the effect of the gel-CM on\nthe proliferation of HDFs, we performed a CCK-8 assay. Compared with the HDFs in the serum-deprivation or 10% FBS microenvironment, no significantly increased cell viability of the HDFs was observed at 24\u00a0 h after treatment with the gel-CM from the serum-free condition. However, a remarkable increased cell viability was detected at 48\u00a0h (P < 0.01), and the difference was much greater at 72\u00a0h (P < 0.001; Fig.\u00a04C).\nThese results indicated that gel-CM from serum-free condition had better effect on promoting proliferation and migration of fibroblasts compared with those from serum-deprivation (2% FBS) or 10% FBS condition."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "Although we reported in our previous paper that SVF-gel could promote chronic wound healing, only a few cases were included, and the follow-up time was too short. In our current study, more clinical cases were included and the results showed that autologous SVF-gel transplantation could significantly promote the healing of chronic wounds, with no complications and recurrences occurred even at a follow-up time as long as 6\u00a0years.\nFor decades, many therapeutic methods have been used to treat chronic wounds. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is one of the most common treatment\nmethods for chronic wounds. The possible mechanisms of NPWT in the treatment of wounds include reducing matrix metalloproteinases, stimulating granulation tissue formation and angiogenesis, reducing edema, thereby improving blood flow and reducing bacterial proliferation [16\u201318]. It was reported that the area of chronic wounds after the application of NPWT was reduced by 17.44% per week on average [19]. Our previous study also showed that the weekly wound healing rate of negative pressure sealing treatment in the control group was 10.16% \u00b1 2.67%, while the weekly wound healing rate in the SVF-gel group was 34.55% \u00b1 11.18% [14]. In addition, the wound healing rate after SVF-gel transplantation was also significantly higher than that of various other ASCs therapies, including adipose tissue transplantation [20, 21], freshly isolated SVF cells [22], uncultured human adipose tissue treated cells [23], in\u00a0vitro cultureexpanded ASCs, and ASC-based biological dressing [24\u2013 26]. Therefore, as a novel ASCs/SVF therapy, SVF-gel has attractive clinical application prospects.\nPreviously, we have revealed that the infiltration of lymphocytes in the deep dermis of the patients treated with SVF-gel was significantly decreased compared with NPWT, suggesting the potential immunomodulatory effect of SVF-gel. Furthermore, Masson staining showed\nmore collagen production, and CD31 immunohistochemistry also showed increased endothelial-specific CD31 expression in wounds in SVF-gel group, which indicated that SVF-gel treatment promoted more angiogenesis and better tissue regeneration [14]. And in our current study, we illustrated that SVF-gel also contributed to chronic wound healing by promoting the migration and proliferation of HDFs, which further enriched the mechanisms of SVF promoting wound healing. However, more detailed data and further investigation are still needed to explore the complex effect of SVF-gel in the future.\nAccording to our previous research, the density of ASCs and endothelial cells (ECs) in SVF-gel was 1.9 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 105 cell/mL and 7.7 \u00b1 2.4 \u00d7 104 cell/mL, respectively. Many studies have shown that ASCs can promote the regeneration and migration of epithelial cells and fibroblasts, increase angiogenesis, and play an immunomodulatory role by secreting a variety of growth factors, such as VEGF, HGF, EGF, and FGF [27\u201329]. ECs directly form capillaries and are the most important functional cells in angiogenesis [30]. Therefore, SVF cells (including ASCs, ECs, and pericytes) may play an important role in SVF-gel promoting the healing of chronic wounds and ensuring their long-lasting efficacy. In addition, in this study, the SEM showed that the SVF-gel had a large number of concentrated and neatly arranged ECM, which mainly included collagen, elastin, mucopolysaccharide, and fibronectin. Studies have found that collagen and fibronectin are important components in the process of wound healing [31]. In addition, ECM can also promote angiogenesis [32], which may explain the increased new blood vessels seen on the histology done after SVF-gel transplantation in our previous study [14]. This may also be the another factor involved in the promotion of chronic wound healing by SVF-gel.\nRecently, accumulating studies have revealed that the beneficial effects of stem cell therapy result from their ability to secrete bioactive factors that exert a positive impact on the recipient cells, rather than their capability to differentiate into the required cells [33\u201336]. It has been well established that ASCs-CM possesses anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities and is able to ameliorate allergic airway inflammation and induce immunologic tolerance [37, 38]. Additionally, it has been reported that numerous neurotrophic, neurogenic, axon guidance, and axon growth proteins were detected within the secretion or extract of ASCs, which are beneficial to the recovery of patients with neurological diseases such as stroke and epilepsy [39\u201341]. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that some clinical studies showed that ASCsCM had a positive effect on accelerating wound healing after fractional carbon dioxide laser resurfacing and\ncombined with that resurfacing for atrophic acne scars and skin rejuvenation [42, 43]. Therefore, the above-mentioned data suggest that the ASCs secretome [44], including a wide range of bioactive molecules like cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and exosomes, has a beneficial effect on different pathophysiological status and disease.\nChronic wound is always accompanied by persistent tissue ischemia and hypoxia, leading to insufficient nutrient supply to the cells. Furthermore, previous study showed that the concentration of serum may affect the effect of gel-CM [45]. To simulate the chronic wound environment with insufficient nutrient supply, different concentrations of serum were used in the current study to treat SVF-gel to obtain different gel-CMs. The results showed that the secretion of the growth factors, especially the EGF and TGF-\u03b21, within the gel-CM increased in the serum-reduced medium, wherein only 2% serum was added. In addition, the CCK-8 and scratch test also showed that the gel-CM from the serum-free condition significantly promoted the proliferation and migration of HDFs compared with that in the serum-deprivation (2% FBS) or 10% FBS microenvironments. Our results were consistent with those of previously published studies, wherein ASCs-CM could accelerate the proliferation and migration of a variety of cells, including ASCs, HDF, ECs, and keratinocytes [46\u201350]. These positive effects may be due to the enhanced expression of the endogenic genes from various cells within the SVF-gel as lower serum concentration was reported to induce the adaptation of the ASCs to a low growth factor environment by increasing the endogenous production of mitotic agents [51]. In addition, under serum starvation conditions, ASCs can simulate limited blood supply, thereby simulating hypoxic and ischemic conditions in the body and then secreting more growth factors or cytokines. This may also be the reason why low serum can stimulate the SVF-gel to secrete more growth factors such as bFGF, EGF, VEGF, and TGF-\u03b21. Thus, we suggested that chronic wounds provide SVF-gel with a low-serum (lownutrients) environment that stimulates SVF-gel to secrete more growth factors to promote wound healing.\nWound healing is a dynamic and complex process that not only requires careful and coordinated interactions between cytokines, resident cells, and infiltrating cells [52], but also requires an adequate blood supply. Among these growth factors and cytokines, EGF can accelerate re-epithelialization by increasing the proliferation and cell migration of keratinocytes [53, 54], while bFGF and VEGF mainly promote fibroblast proliferation and migration [55, 56]. In addition, it is reported that TGF-\u03b21 plays an active role in skin wound healing by promoting epithelial regeneration, wound contracture, angiogenesis,\nscar formation and ECM deposition [56]. In particular, TGF-\u03b21 stimulates the migration of dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes more obviously [57, 58]. In our study, the promotion of SVF-gel in chronic wound healing may be explained as a serum starvation condition constructed by chronic wounds encourages SVF-gel to secret more cytokines or growth factors required for wound healing.\nGenerally, there are some merits of SVF-gel as a novel stem cell therapy as compared to other traditional ASC therapy. SVF cells are still protected by ECM that is three-dimensional and has natural scaffolds, which may improve the long-term retention rate of SVF cells as compared to those of ASCs or SVF suspensions. In addition, SVF cells avoid the usage of exogenous products, the application of collagenase, and in\u00a0 vitro culture process as compared to ASC therapy. Moreover, SVF-gel can be harvested quickly in the operating room, and a specialized laboratory is not required. The clinical results showed that autologous SVF-gel transplantation significantly promoted chronic wound healing, with no complications and recurrence of ulcers. However, the optimal volume, time, and duration of SVF-gel transplantation need to be further determined. In addition, a larger-scale, multicenter clinical controlled trial is still needed in the future."
