Among refugee parents, stressors such as language difficulties, adapting to a new culture, and discrimination can be such external factors that thwart parental self- efficacy (e.g., Ali,\u00a0 2008; Boruszak- Kiziukiewicz & Kmita,\u00a0 2020; Eltanamly et al.,\u00a0 under review). Also, children's transition to adolescence, and its associated renegotiation of power dynamics within a family, can reduce parental self- efficacy (Glatz & Buchanan,\u00a02015a). Refugee parents of adolescents are, therefore, at an increased risk of reductions in their self- efficacy, which are linked to suboptimal parenting practices (Eltanamly et al.,\u00a0under review; Jones & Prinz,\u00a02005), delinquent behavior, and substance use in adolescents (Kapetanovic et al.,\u00a0 2019). It is therefore important to find ways to\nstrengthen parental self- efficacy in refugee families. In the present study, we aimed (1) to test whether we can strengthen parental self- efficacy in refugee parents using a brief, focused intervention, and (2) whether this intervention makes parental self- efficacy less impacted by post- migration stressors. We conducted this study primarily with Syrian refugee parents of adolescents who have recently resettled in the Netherlands.\nParental feelings of self- efficacy are essential for parents in every stage of children's development, including adolescence (Slagt et al.,\u00a02012). According to Bandura's social cognitive theory, self- efficacy influences human functioning by impacting several cognitive, choice, and motivational processes (Bandura, 1999). Higher self- efficacy would therefore relate to greater cognitive f lexibility, weighing of multiple options, and more\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

Using a within- subject experimental design, experience\nsampling data were collected in 2019 from 53 refugee parents of adolescents\n(Mage\u00a0= 39.7, SDage\u00a0= 5.59, 73% Syrian, 70% mothers) in the Netherlands.

In fact, parental self- efficacy relates to parents being more likely to plan and exercise control over their behavior when encountering parenting challenges (Jones & Prinz,\u00a02005). Parents with higher self- efficacy tend to be warmer, more involved, and engage more in monitoring their child and adolescent's behavior (Shumow & Lomax,\u00a02002; Teti & Gelfand,\u00a0 1991). Furthermore, increases in parental self- efficacy predict increases in supportive parenting and decreases in inept discipline over time (e.g., Dekovi\u0107 et al.,\u00a02010), which are factors associated with favorable child and adolescent adjustment (e.g., Bandura,\u00a01977; Jones & Prinz,\u00a02005; Meunier & Roskam,\u00a0 2009). Adolescence is a turning point for the onset of problematic functioning (Kapetanovic et al.,\u00a0 2019; Lougheed,\u00a0 2020). Therefore uncovering simple techniques that could be used to strengthen parents' perseverance in the face of parenting challenges is very crucial, particularly, in populations at risk of reductions in their parental self- efficacy, such as refugee parents of adolescents.\nParental self- efficacy among refugee parents of adolescents\nBecoming a refugee can be a disempowering experience (Bowie et al.,\u00a0 2017). On top of exposure to lifethreatening conditions, war refugees often go through multiple displacements before they resettle in countries that allow them to apply for asylum, eventually becoming refugees (Williams,\u00a02010). In the process, many people lose their social structures, cultural values, and above all, their self- identity (Aroian et al.,\u00a02008; Samarasinghe & Arvidsson,\u00a0 2002). Such losses are related to feeling incapable of managing the new circumstances among different refugee populations (Sulaiman- Hill & Thompson,\u00a0 2013; Tran,\u00a0 1993; Vromans et al.,\u00a0 2018). In fact, evidence is building that refugee populations experience reductions in their self- efficacy (e.g., Hoffman et al.,\u00a02020; Tran,\u00a01993).\nSpecifically, post- migration stress is known to reduce parental self- efficacy in refugee parents (e.g., Ali,\u00a0 2008; Boruszak- Kiziukiewicz & Kmita,\u00a0 2020). Part of post- migration stress is having to constantly deal with novel and changing situations, which necessitate seeking the help of others (Aroian et al.,\u00a02008), sometimes even one's own children. A parent's role, as someone who can guide their children through different situations, is then jeopardized and refugee parents sometimes feel that they have \u201cfailed their children\u201d (Ali,\u00a02008, p. 156). One's experience of failing could be particularly harmful if it happens before a sense of efficacy is firmly established, such as in the case of families going through multiple transitions (Bandura,\u00a01998). Many parents also experience lower agency in their\nparenting as misconceptions about child protection services in resettlement countries can contribute to their fear of having their children removed from their custody, if they adopt some of the parenting practices they used in their homeland (Bowie et al.,\u00a0 2017; Hoffman et al.,\u00a02020). In other words, a disruption in their perceptions of their ability to fulfill their parental roles coupled with a minimized agency in parenting (Merry et al.,\u00a02017), may put their parental self- efficacy at risk. In fact, a sense of loss, problems dealing with new situations, language difficulties, not feeling at home, and discrimination were found to compromise parental self- efficacy in Syrian refugee populations (Eltanamly et al.,\u00a0under review).\nFurthermore, children's transition to adolescence can reduce parental self- efficacy (Glatz & Buchanan,\u00a0 2015a). An inherent part of adolescent development is the increased demand for autonomy (Wray- Lake et al.,\u00a02010). Adolescents' autonomy striving redefines the relational dynamics with parents, which goes hand- in- hand with temporary increases in conflicts between parents and children (De Goede et al.,\u00a0 2009). These changes might feel particularly threatening for refugee parents as they might view their children's need to develop their own identities as an indication of their own inability to compete with the host culture. They might therefore doubt whether their parenting efforts are successful in sustaining family cohesion, a vital issue for immigrant and refugee families (Boruszak- Kiziukiewicz & Kmita,\u00a02020). Research on migrant populations (e.g., Asians) reveals that adolescents are granted more autonomy than their parents would like to give them, due to immigration (Russell et al.,\u00a02010). Refugee parents could feel reduced agency in their parenting and fewer mastery experiences, which are key sources of self- efficacy (Bandura,\u00a01977; Glatz & Buchanan,\u00a02015b; Jones & Prinz,\u00a02005). Thus, the re- organization of parent\u2013 child interaction patterns that typically occurs as children transition to adolescence (Granic et al.,\u00a02003) can be an added source of stress for refugee parents who are already dealing with post- migration challenges.\nCan we promote parental self- efficacy? Evidence for malleability\nThere is evidence that interventions to support parents can improve parental self- efficacy in ways that predict meaningful changes in parenting behavior. For example, it was found that individual and group parenting interventions improve parental self- efficacy (Amin et al.,\u00a0 2018; Mouton et al.,\u00a0 2018b; Wittkowski et al.,\u00a0 2016), and explain improvements in parenting behavior in community samples (Dekovi\u0107 et al.,\u00a02010). Such interventions vary in length, and some are as brief as a single session (Wittkowski et al.,\u00a02016). Self- efficacy\n14678624, 2023, 1, D ow nloaded from https://srcd.onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1111/cdev.13848 by T ilburg U niversity L ibrary, W iley O nline L ibrary on [03/01/2023].

The effectiveness of these approaches provides evidence for the malleability of parental selfefficacy, even in a single session.\nAccording to Bandura's self- efficacy theory (1977), mastery experiences are the most effective way to strengthen someone's sense of efficacy, which is followed by verbal feedback and social comparisons (1989). Parents' sense of competence thus depends on those moments when they have experienced success despite parenting challenges (e.g., Verhage et al.,\u00a02013). It also depends on the positive feedback that appreciates parents' efforts\u2014 especially when this feedback is given by \u201cauthority figures\u201d (e.g., university researchers; Cass\u00e9 et al.,\u00a0 2015; Mouton et al.,\u00a02018a), and is framed in terms of a social comparison that suggests that parents are doing a good job relative to other parents (e.g., Mouton & Roskam,\u00a02015). For example, a procedure to manipulate parental self- efficacy developed by Mouton and Roskam\u00a0(2015) was tested in a quasi- experimental micro- trial with 42 mothers. In this study, the experimenters presented themselves as university researchers to be perceived by participants as experts in the field and gave participants positive feedback on their parenting skills, referring to questionnaires they had filled out at a previous time point, and compared their performance to others. This manipulation proved effective in boosting mothers' perceived parental self- efficacy. Thus, the findings from Mouton et al.\u00a0 (2018a) indicate that elements of social learning theory can be successfully applied to strengthen parental self- efficacy. However, whether elements of social learning theory can also be effective in strengthening parental self- efficacy in refugee populations is not known yet, and therefore investigated in the present study.\nThere is preliminary evidence that parental selfefficacy can also be enhanced in refugee populations. For example, Morina et al.\u00a0(2018) used mastery experiences to strengthen self- efficacy among a Turkish sample of refugees resettled in Switzerland. In addition, parenting interventions aimed at supporting refugee parents seem to contribute to strengthening parental self- efficacy in Syrian, Karen, Rohingya, and Afghan refugee families (El- Khani et al.,\u00a0 2018; Hoffman et al.,\u00a0 2020; Shaw et al.,\u00a0 2020). Until now, however, studies primarily focused on the feasibility and acceptability of programs in those populations, and the field is less developed in terms of the specific effects that these programs yield. Given the importance of parental self- efficacy for refugee parents, it is important to develop and rigorously evaluate simple techniques that can be used by professionals working with these parents to strengthen parental self- efficacy.\nDoes increased parental self- efficacy fuel resilience?\nA high sense of efficacy is related to well- being. For example, higher self- efficacy is related to better recovery from trauma in war- affected populations (Benight & Bandura, 2004) and to higher levels of positive affect, over time, among a diverse sample of refugees resettled in the United Kingdom (Tip et al.,\u00a02020). However, these studies used static measures of well- being which fail to capture the dynamic nature of self- efficacy that tends to f luctuate in response to the social context (Bandura,\u00a0 1999; Eltanamly et al.,\u00a0 under review). Previous work that tried to capture the dynamic nature of parental self- efficacy shows that the way refugee parents constantly reappraise their competence is impacted by fluctuations in post- migration stressors that they experience during the day (Eltanamly et al.,\u00a0 under review). However, strengthening parental self- efficacy does not necessarily mean that it will become less impacted by post- migration stress. Selfefficacy can actually be higher after an intervention aimed at strengthening it, yet still show a dynamic pattern where it f luctuates in response to post- migration stress (Eltanamly et al.,\u00a0under review). We, therefore, defined resilience in this study as momentary increases in post- migration stress that are not followed by reductions in parental self- efficacy (Kuranova et al.,\u00a02020). In the present study, we tested the effect of strengthening parental self- efficacy of refugee parents in an authentic real- life context and thereby fostered our understanding of real- time parental cognitions and how they are shaped by environmental stimuli in refugee populations.\nAccording to social cognitive theory, perceiving one's environment as stressful is not only a function of objective stressors but also of how people view their efficacy in managing the stressor (Bandura,\u00a0 1997, 1999). By strengthening refugee parents' self- efficacy, they may feel less challenged by difficult parenting situations and also less challenged by everyday demands. Indeed, higher self- efficacy is related to appraising challenges less negatively, both in community (Schulz et al.,\u00a02019) and immigrant samples (Dumka et al.,\u00a01996). As such, promoting refugee parents' self- efficacy likely reduces their perceptions of stress and how challenged they feel by difficult parenting situations, which are\u2014 to a great extent\u2014 occurring as a consequence of post- migration stress (Miao et al.,\u00a02018; Ochocka & Janzen,\u00a02008)."

Second, to test whether the intervention makes parental self- efficacy less impacted by post- migration stressors. The intervention includes a personalized component delivered within a standardized structure. Through the intervention, participants are given feedback on their parenting, which is delivered in a way that taps into the three sources of selfefficacy: mastery experiences, verbal persuasion, and social comparison.\nTo reach our study goals, we conducted a withinsubject experimental study. To do that, we employed a randomized multiple baseline design using the experience sampling method (ESM). This design has several advantages: first, it allows for the sound evaluation of an intervention with fewer participants (compared to a traditional between- person experiment), making the design particularly suitable for hard- to- reach populations such as refugee families (Biglan et al.,\u00a0 2000). Second, randomization of the intervention timing makes sure that threats to internal validity such as history and maturation (i.e., factors that could occur during the course of an experiment and that would bias results) do not interact with the treatment effects (Edgington,\u00a01996). The use of ESM also has several advantages: first, it reduces recall bias, increasing ecological validity as participants' experiences were assessed as they occurred (Larson & Csikszentmihalyi,\u00a02014). Second, it allows the collection of a large number of data points from each participant, increasing the within- person power. Third, ESM allowed us to chart fluctuations in post- migration stress and parental self- efficacy as they happen throughout the day (Larson & Csikszentmihalyi,\u00a02014). We were, therefore, able to capture the dynamics between parental self- efficacy and post- migration stress on a momentary basis, allowing us to test whether the intervention buffers against the negative impact of minor, yet recurring stressors, on parental self- efficacy. Finally, combining ESM with a randomized multiple baseline design afforded us the scientific rigor to make definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of our intervention (Kazdin,\u00a02019). We expected the intervention to (1) improve mean withinperson levels of parental self- efficacy, and (2) weaken the negative link between post- migration stress(t\u22121) on parental self- efficacy(t)."

The impact of the intervention can, therefore, be assessed in relation to each participant's functioning before the intervention. In this design, the use of repeated assessments before (i.e.,\nbaseline) and post- intervention are fundamental. Data from the baseline period can be used to (1) describe functioning before the intervention; and (2) to predict functioning in the immediate future, if no intervention had been delivered. Data from the post- intervention phase can be used to test whether functioning postintervention is different from the projected functioning, if no intervention had been delivered (Kazdin,\u00a0 2019). Combining the within- subject design with randomized multiple baselines strengthens the scientific rigor of the design, allowing us to test whether change in parental self- efficacy is a function of an experimental manipulation (Edgington,\u00a01996; Tate et al.,\u00a02008). Specifically, the different participants who are randomly assigned to different baseline phases serve as control conditions to test whether changes in parental self- efficacy can occur without delivering the intervention. Using a multiple baseline design can demonstrate that intervention effects happen \u201cwhen and only when\u201d the intervention is delivered (Kazdin,\u00a02019, p. 7)."

Parents had at least one adolescent child (Mage\u00a0= 12.60, SDage\u00a0= 1.72), were refugees of war, spoke Arabic, and were primarily Syrian (73%). Participants had, on average, 13.86 years of education, slightly higher than the expected 9 years of education in Syria (Central Intelligence Agency,\u00a02018), but comparable to the average education level of Syrians in the Netherlands (Dagevos et al.,\u00a0 2018). Parents lived in the Netherlands for over three years (Mmonths\u00a0 = 41; SD\u00a0=\u00a013.79) at the time of enrollment in the study, see online Appendix\u00a0 A: Table A1 for demographic information. All participants were offered aid in seeking therapeutic support for any bad memories triggered, and for any mental health problems more generally. None of the parents felt that this was necessary. More details about the sample and the momentary fluctuations in post- migration stress and parental self- efficacy are reported in (Eltanamly et al.,\u00a0under review).\nOur final sample for this study consisted of 53 participants (see Figure\u00a01). Two participants dropped out: one because of personal problems and one because the study triggered bad memories. Two participants were removed from the analyses: one participant expressed that she randomly chose one of her children to report on for each assessment instead of consistently reporting on her parenting of the same child. The other participant had to be referred to professional help because of signs of dysfunctional family dynamics (i.e., parentification).

When comparing participants who had low adherence percentages to participants who had more than 25% of their data points filled in, no differences were reported in positive parenting, post- traumatic stress symptoms, and on most sociodemographic variables.

Participants were blind to the randomization of the baseline period before the intervention, and they were unaware of the specific aims of the research and were told that the study investigated how their new surroundings might be influencing their children's adjustment. Participants were visited at home three times by a contact person (i.e., either the first author or a trained research assistant).\nFirst: Psychological measures and parenting interview\nAt the first data collection point, parents provided written informed consent and filled in demographic information. If participants had more than one child in the age range between 10 and 15, we randomly chose a child for the parents to report on using the random number generator function in MS Excel. Participants were asked to report on their parenting of that particular child and also filled in The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist for DSM- 5 (PCL\u2013 5; Blevins et al.,\u00a02015; Ibrahim et al.,\u00a02018) to measure trauma symptoms. Furthermore, participants took part in a semi- structured interview guided by the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APQ; Frick,\u00a01991), which was audio recorded.\nSecond: Start of baseline ESM assessment\nAt least 4 weeks later, we installed the Ethica App to collect ESM data on participants' smartphones. Participants were shown how the app works and responded to a sample questionnaire in the presence of the research assistant. Those responses were later removed in the data cleaning process. The spacing of 4 weeks was intended to make sure participants' responses to the questionnaires and the parenting interview did not influence their momentary assessments. For the following 15 days (i.e., 6\u2013 8 days baseline and 6\u2013 8 days post- intervention, depending on intervention day), participants received notifications on their phones 10 times a day signaling momentary questionnaires to be filled in. Notifications were sent at quasi- random moments between 7:30 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. One day after the start of the ESM data collection, participants were contacted by phone to make sure the smartphone application worked correctly and participants were encouraged to get in touch with the research assistant, should any technical problems arise.\nThird: Intervention and update\nThe day before the intervention, the family's contact person called the parent to confirm the appointment.\nTo mask the aim of the visit, participants were told that this visit aimed to update the smartphone application. To simulate an application update, participants' phones were used to synchronize their data, something that happens automatically, but can be manually activated. The actual goal of the third visit was the delivery of the intervention (see Intervention). On the day following the intervention, participants were contacted again to make sure the smartphone application worked after the update."

Specifically, we intended to help parents draw the connection between their positive parenting behavior and the positive impact it had on their children. We did this using personalized feedback within a standardized structure. Specifically, we targeted different components of self- efficacy: a mastery experience based on a true story, verbal persuasion, and positive social comparison.\nPersonalized component\nPersonal feedback was based on parents' answers to the positive parenting subscale of the APQ which they gave in a semi- structured interview format during the first data collection point. The first and fourth authors (a clinical psychologist) coded the interviews independently. In cases (n\u00a0=\u00a01) where dysfunctional family dynamics were suspected, it was deemed unethical to conduct the research. We, therefore, referred families for further help and did not deliver the intervention.\nBased on translated transcripts of the audio recordings, we selected parents' statements about positive parenting behavior scoring highest on (1) mastery (i.e., the parent perceived it as a result of their action); (2) impact (i.e., the parent mentioned a positive impact on the child); (3) detail: (i.e., whether there was enough detail to build a story); and (4) clarity. If more than one statement had the same score, one of those statements was randomly selected. Statements were selected with a high interrater agreement (89.2%).\nStandardized structure\nThe standardized structure was guided by the intervention conducted by Mouton and Roskam\u00a0(2015) and tapped into\n14678624, 2023, 1, D ow nloaded from https://srcd.onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1111/cdev.13848 by T ilburg U niversity L ibrary, W iley O nline L ibrary on [03/01/2023].

The participant was told that their data were analyzed at the lab of the University of Amsterdam and offered to view preliminary results. This way, the feedback was perceived as being based on sound scientific research, hence increasing the impact of verbal persuasion. In addition to the feedback on their positive parenting skills, participants were socially compared to other participants in the study using a graph on which the participant ranked highly on positive parenting. This way, all participants received personalized messages, which were provided using a standard structure. For example, below is a transcript of a chosen statement from one of the interviews which was woven into the standardized structure to show the parent how their positive parenting related to positive child outcomes:\nParent: \u201cOnce we had visitors over, parents of her brother's school friends. She did everything and helped me with translation. I forgot to serve something, and she brought it while the guests were still there. After they left, I told her that I had really appreciated that. Interviewer: \u201cAnd how did your daughter react?\u201d Parent: \u201cYou can see that she feels powerful and strong.\nSelf- confident. That she is no longer the shy girl that she used to be.\u201d Personalized component: \u201cDuring the first interview you told [interviewer] of that day when you had visitors over and [child's name] helped out with serving food for the guests, and how she helped you out with translation. That day you told her that you appreciated what she had done. You saw the positive impact it had on her. She feels powerful and strong. She is self- confident and she is no longer the shy girl that she used to be.\u201d\nThis way, we helped parents recognize how their positive parenting behavior had a positive impact on their child. Therefore, in a single session, we aimed to strengthen parental self- efficacy relying on personalized mastery experiences, the strongest source of parental self- efficacy (Bandura,\u00a01989)."

Second, it considers the unequal spacing of assessments using the TINTERVAL option (as participants were triggered at random points per day but not during the night). Third, it deals with missing data using Bayesian statistics by modeling parameters for the missing data in the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm (McNeish & Hamaker,\u00a0 2019). We used at least 45,000 iterations in Mplus and two MCMC chains. Because the first half of each chain is discarded as burn- in, and because we used a thinning rate of every 10th iteration (meaning that only 1 in 10 iterations is saved), our results here are based on 4500 iterations (see Gelman et al.,\u00a02014). We checked model convergence by checking that the potential scale reduction factor stayed below 1.1. We checked for signs of lack of convergence by checking the trace plots for spikes or the two chains drifting away from each other. In such case, we would use a thinning rate of every 5th iteration. We had at least 6 days of data (i.e., 60 assessments) before the single- session intervention (i.e., baseline phase) and at least 6 days of data after the intervention (i.e., post- intervention phase).\nWe tested our first research question\u2014 whether the intervention increased parental self- efficacy\u2014 in two steps. First, we had to check whether there was any change in parental self- efficacy during the baseline phase and whether any change in parental self- efficacy post- intervention was gradual or abrupt. To do that, we used Interrupted Time Series Analyses (ITSA) within a DSEM framework by including time trends in the model, following recommendations by Huitema and Mckean\u00a0 (2000). We, therefore, created a serial variable (1, 2, 3\u2026) that denoted the assessment point (i.e., slope); we created a dummy variable for the phase (i.e., baseline vs. post- intervention); and we created a second serial variable starting at the assessment moment following the intervention (0, 0, 0\u2026 for the baseline phase and 0, 1, 2, 3\u2026 for the post- intervention phase) noting the assessment points post- intervention (i.e., slope change). We estimated the linear change in parental self- efficacy during baseline (i.e., using the slope variable) and the change in this slope post- intervention (i.e., using the slope change variable). We were, therefore, able to examine whether participants reported a gradual change in parental selfefficacy, both, during baseline and post- intervention. Second, if there was no gradual change in parental selfefficacy over time, we would test the intervention effect without controlling for slopes (i.e., we would not include time trends in the model). In this case, we would then use the dummy variable for the phase to investigate the differences in mean levels of parental self- efficacy between both phases (i.e., mean level change) as a random effect. In this model, the estimate for level change in parental self- efficacy represents the change in mean level as caused by the intervention. The effect of the mean level change was specified as random because we expected the\neffect of the intervention to vary across individuals. We re- ran the analyses controlling for the child's age, parent's education level, and parent's gender.\nWe computed the between- case standardized mean difference (BC- SMD; Valentine et al.,\u00a02016) using a webbased calculator version 0.4.2.9300. This gave an overall estimate of the change in parental self- efficacy from baseline to post- intervention on a group level. BC- SMD is an effect size designed for single- case experimental studies with multiple participants and is comparable to between- group experimental studies. BC- SMD accounts for a nested data structure, repeated assessments, and between and within- subject variances. BC- SMD allows for modeling up to sixth- degree polynomial trends for each phase. If the ITSA results show no trends (i.e., gradual changes) in parental self- efficacy before and postintervention, we would calculate the BC- SMD assuming no trends. To calculate the BC- SMD, we used restricted maximum likelihood estimation allowing for random effects during baseline and post- intervention. This allowed participants to vary in their initial baseline scores and in their rates of change in parental self- efficacy postintervention. The effect size was interpreted as small (0.2), medium (0.5), or large (0.8; Cohen,\u00a01992).\nWe tested our second research question\u2014 whether the intervention buffered against the negative impact of postmigration stress(t\u22121) on parental self- efficacy(t)\u2014 by means of an interaction. Specifically, we examined whether the effect of post- migration stress(t\u22121) on parental selfefficacy(t) changed from baseline to post- intervention. To do this, we created a lagged variable (lag \u22121) for postmigration stress to create an interaction variable of phase (baseline vs. post- intervention) \u00d7 lagged post- migration stress. To facilitate interpretation, post- migration stress was group- mean centered before computing the interaction term. We then modeled the interaction effect of phase (baseline vs. post- intervention) \u00d7 lagged postmigration stress on parental self- efficacy, as a random effect. Using this model, we tested whether the intervention weakened the association between post- migration stress and later parental self- efficacy. The slope of lagged post- migration stress was specified as random because we expected its association with parental self- efficacy to vary across individuals. To obtain the significance of the beta for PMS(t\u22121) on PSE post- intervention we re- ran the analysis with phase reverse- coded (1\u00a0=\u00a0pre- intervention, 0\u00a0=\u00a0post- intervention)."

We, therefore, did not need to control for slopes in our analyses.

Self- efficacy indeed increased from baseline to post- intervention (mean change B\u00a0= .69, 95% CI [0.04, 1.34]). On average, parental self- efficacy increased from 27.82 during the baseline phase (on a scale of 0\u2013 40) to 28.51 during the post- intervention phase. The BCSMD effect size was small (0.089; 95% CI [0.01, 0.17]). Importantly, participants varied in the extent to which they experienced an increase in parental self- efficacy (VariancePSE\u00a0= 4.44, 95% CI [2.73, 7.32] see Figure\u00a02).\nAs per our preregistration, we controlled for child's age, parent's years of education, and parent's gender to see if they would change our findings. None of the covariates were significant and the interpretation of results stayed the same. This means that the intervention strengthened parental self- efficacy regardless of how old children in the sample were, how well- educated parents\nwere, and regardless of whether mothers or fathers were participating (Figure\u00a0 3 shows the momentary fluctuations in parental self- efficacy along the course of the study for three different participants randomized to different baselines).\nDoes strengthening parental self- efficacy buffer against post- migration stress?\nTo test whether the intervention buffered against the negative association between post- migration stress and parental self- efficacy, we modeled the interaction of phase \u00d7 post- migration stress on parental self- efficacy. Parental self- efficacy became less dependent upon post- migration stress after the intervention. While postmigration stress had a negative impact on parental selfefficacy during baseline phase (\u03b2\u00a0= \u22120.08, 95% CI [\u22120.14, \u22120.03]), this link weakened post- intervention (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0 0.09, 95% CI [0.03, 0.15]; see Table 2), rendering the net effect of post- migration stress on parental self- efficacy non- significant (\u03b2\u00a0= \u22120.05, 95% CI [\u22120.12, 0.04]).

Specifically, the call invites researchers to design and test interventions that aim to improve the conditions (e.g., parenting) in which war- affected children live. Parental self- efficacy is a key construct affecting parenting behavior and child adjustment (Jones & Prinz,\u00a02005), also among refugee populations (Eltanamly et al.,\u00a0under review). The personalized brief intervention we tested, strengthened momentary parental self- efficacy and made refugee parents more resilient\u2014 their self- efficacy became less impacted by post- migration stressors. In our study, we found evidence for the proposition that interventions for refugee parents can buffer against the momentary negative effects of non- modifiable stressors facing caregivers (Puffer et al.,\u00a02017).\nOur findings show that giving parents personalized feedback on their positive parenting and helping them draw the connection between their behavior and the positive impact it had on their children can improve their momentary self- efficacy and how much agency they think they can exercise in the parenting realm. While Mouton and Roskam\u00a0(2015) relied on false feedback in their study, allowing them to provide all parents with the exact same feedback, we based our feedback on stories parents had shared with us during the first data collection moment. Our study advances the field of parenting interventions by showing that manipulation of a single aspect of parenting\u2014 in this case, parental self- efficacy\u2014 can have an immediate impact on parents' momentary cognitions.\nOur findings also show that higher self- efficacy and having a stronger will to exercise agency with one's children seem to buffer against the negative impact of postmigration stress on momentary parental cognitions. It might be that higher self- efficacy made parents feel better about themselves and therefore appraised their contexts as less challenging. In other words, as parents' self- efficacy was enhanced, they might have associated more positive meanings to their momentary stressors, fostering their resiliency (Bandura,\u00a0 1997). In addition, changes in momentary parental self- efficacy might have changed parents' perceived post- migration stress. For example, if the intervention reassures parents that they are doing a good job raising their children, situations in which parents need to rely on their children (e.g., for their language skills) may become less stressful. It could be, for example, that increased feelings of self- efficacy change parents' perception from feeling inadequate (e.g., struggling with a new language) to attributing their children's abilities to their own efforts as parents. In line with this, our post hoc analyses show that parents reported lower post- migration stress post- intervention.\nAlthough we found support for our hypotheses, they have to be interpreted with caution. First, there may have been a selection bias in the parents who were willing to participate in the study. Because we could not collect data on parents invited but unwilling to participate, we do not know if they differed from the parents\nwho participated in the study. It could be the case, however, that especially parents with an interest in or conscious of challenges in their everyday parenting situations may have been inclined to participate, relating to a higher motivation for change. Importantly, parents varied substantially in how they responded to the intervention. This finding is not unique. Parenting intervention effects are often driven by a smaller percentage who reap large intervention gains (e.g., van Aar et al.,\u00a0 2017). This is also the case in the current study, in which the intervention effect was driven by about 30% of the participants, a percentage comparable to individuals identified as especially sensitive to environmental stimuli, including interventions (20%\u2013 30%; Pluess,\u00a0 2015). Who are those who benefited the most? Post hoc analyses revealed that participants who benefited the most from the intervention had reported significantly more post- traumatic stress symptoms prior to the intervention, and those whose self- efficacy dropped post- intervention (n\u00a0=\u00a03) had reported somewhat higher momentary parental self- efficacy during baseline (M\u00a0=\u00a0 30.57, compared to M\u00a0=\u00a0 28.64 in those who benefited). Interestingly, in our sample, higher post- traumatic stress symptoms were associated with lower trait parental self- efficacy. Findings pertaining to PTSD need to be interpreted with caution, however, given the small sample size on which they are based (i.e., 15 responders). Still, they seem to echo previous findings that indeed report that the families who benefit the most from interventions are the ones who need it the most (Leijten et al.,\u00a02018; van Aar et al.,\u00a02017).\nOur findings are not without limitations. Maybe the most obvious limitation is the absence of a control group that does not receive the intervention. While our design uses each participant as their own control condition, we cannot exclude the fact that the intervention effect might have not been induced by the intervention, but rather because participants received some form of praise. Future studies might test such potential effects by including a control group with participants who do not receive the intervention, yet are given positive feedback on non- parenting questions. A second limitation is that the study was demanding, which could have resulted in low adherence percentages among older parents and those with more children. A third limitation is that we did not test whether strengthening parental selfefficacy had any spill- over effects on parenting behavior and child outcomes. While we know that the more efficacious parents feel, the better they parent, and the more their children benefit (e.g., Glatz & Buchanan,\u00a0 2015b; Jones & Prinz,\u00a02005; Mouton et al.,\u00a02018a), we neither know whether this is the case for momentary parenting behavior nor if strengthening momentary parental selfefficacy has any effects on children.\nDespite these limitations, several strengths give us confidence in our findings. First, the use of a randomized within- subject experimental design utilizing novel\n14678624, 2023, 1, D ow nloaded from https://srcd.onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1111/cdev.13848 by T ilburg U niversity L ibrary, W iley O nline L ibrary on [03/01/2023].

In addition, our sensitivity analyses give us greater confidence that the way we designed the intervention is the driver behind the change rather than who delivered the intervention or whether the participant had sustained contact with the same research assistant. Finally, the brevity of our intervention is especially relevant for at- risk populations, such as refugee parents, who might find it challenging to engage in longer interventions.\nOur findings show that it is possible to strengthen parental self- efficacy in refugee populations using personalized positive feedback, which, if replicated with longer- term follow- ups, can be easily implemented in clinical and intervention settings. In simple terms, using stories that parents share about successful parenting moments to help them see the positive effect it had on their children can enhance their parental self- efficacy. Important to mention, the effect size of the intervention was small. This might be explained by the nature of the intervention being a very brief single- session intervention. This was also the case in similar single- session interventions aimed at strengthening self- efficacy in war veterans and Turkish refugees, where small effects on self- efficacy and on distress were reported, respectively (Brown et al.,\u00a02016; Morina et al.,\u00a02018). Especially relevant for scaling up and optimizing the intervention, future research can build on the present study to test whether a more structured intervention with repeated sessions would yield stronger effect sizes. Specifically, how self- efficacy increases over time, should more sessions be offered (Murray et al.,\u00a02020). Similarly, future research should test the effects of the intervention on real- time parenting behavior and on children.\nWhile our study did not assess whether the momentary effects translated into sustained changes in parenting and child outcomes, our findings add a valuable piece to a greater puzzle. Namely, they show that parental cognitions fluctuate in response to post- migration stress, but that through intervention they can be made less responsive to stressors such as discrimination, language difficulties, and marginalization. We expand previous work by showing how protective factors in at- risk families can be strengthened, an approach that allows vulnerable families to capitalize on their strengths to build resilience."
