Based on the provided text, the portion mentioning future research directions is not explicitly stated. The text extensively discusses the findings and implications of the study on Psidium species, including genomic, epigenomic variations, and their effects on essential oil yield and composition. However, it does not directly outline specific future research directions. For accurate extraction of future research directions, the text would typically include phrases like "future studies should investigate," "further research is needed to," or similar language indicating areas that have not been fully explored or questions that remain unanswered. Since such phrases are not present or highlighted in the provided text, it's challenging to extract a specific quote regarding future research directions without further context or sections of the paper that might explicitly discuss this.
