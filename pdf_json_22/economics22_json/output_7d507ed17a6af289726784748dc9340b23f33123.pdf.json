    "abstractText": "Modified BG Prasad Socioeconomic Status Scale: Updated for the Year 2022 2.88 [7]. Considering the new base year as 2016, there have been some updates of the scale in the recent past [8, 9], and an online tool was also developed previously to update the scale in real time [10]. However, as this calculator considers the base year as 2001(the older base year), the values given by the calculator are no longer valid. To update the scale for 2022, we took the latest CPI (IW) available from the website of Labour Bureau which is 125.1 for January, 2022. Multiplication factor = current CPI (125.1)/Base index value in 2016 (100) =1.251. The new income ranges can now be calculated using the following equation: New income value = Multiplication factor \u00d7 Old income value \u00d7 4.63 \u00d7 4.93 \u00d7 2.88. Where 4.63, 4.93, and 2.88 are the linking factors given by the Labour Bureau. Using the above equation, the updated ranges for the scale for January, 2022 were calculated, as shown in Table I. To conclude, there is a need to periodically update the incomebased socioeconomic scales due to continuous changes in the price of the goods and services as a consequence of inflation. MD.
