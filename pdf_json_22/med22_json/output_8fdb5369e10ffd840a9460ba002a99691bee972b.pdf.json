    "abstractText": "OBJECTIVES: The present study aims to investigate outcomes after the surgical treatment of acute type A aortic dissection in regard to three available selective cerebral perfusion strategies. METHODS: From 2000 to 2019, patients were selected based on the employment of either retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP), unilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion (uACP) or bilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion (bACP) during open zone-0 anastomosis. Propensity score TriMatch analysis considering several preoperative and intraoperative variables was used to identify well-balanced triplets. The primary end point of the study was a new cerebral operation-related neurologic deficit. Presented at the 35th Annual Meeting of the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, Barcelona, Spain, 13\u201316 October 2021. C O N V EN TI O N A L A O R TI C",

            "text": "The surgical treatment of acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) remains challenging and is still associated with high mortality and morbidity rates, especially in the elderly [1]. The main target of surgery is the excision of the primary intimal tear and an open distal anastomosis to seal false lumen and expand true lumen, resolving malperfusion [2]. Present surgical approaches require the use of hypothermic circulatory arrest, possibly employing selective cerebral perfusion strategies. Several concepts were developed over the years: retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) was suggested in the 1990s as adjunct to straight deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA), whereas antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP) became more popular in the following decades, allowing circulatory arrests at moderate hypothermia [3, 4]. Antegrade perfusion is widely used both in unilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion (uACP) and bilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion (bACP) fashion and was shown to provide favourable outcomes, especially with prolonged circulatory arrest times [5]. Although outcomes of these perfusion strategies have been extensively analyzed and bACP has currently become the most used method, a unanimous consensus on which selective cerebral perfusion should be preferred is still missing [4].\nTherefore, we aimed to investigate the results of RCP, uACP and bACP after surgical treatment for ATAAD."

Exclusion criteria were surgeries performed under DHCA alone and iatrogenic ATAAD. Stable patients with pain-to-cut time exceeding 48 h were also excluded since in some cases such dissections undergo delayed aortic repair and would bias the acute surgical setting of this analysis. To increase baseline homogeneity, patients treated with extensive aortic arch surgery were also excluded. The definition of the final study population and the partition in three groups according to the selective cerebral perfusion strategy is summarized in Fig. 1."

            "text": "The preferred cannulation site for arterial perfusion was the right axillary or the femoral artery for ACP and RCP, respectively. A moderate hypothermia (24\u201328 C) was achieved in the ACP surgeries, whereas deeper temperatures (16\u201317 C) were reached in the RCP group. According to the different cannulation setting and cooling protocol, in the ACP group, an archfirst approach was favoured. Based on operative reports, a clear discrimination between isolated ascending and hemiarch replacement was made, considering if the operating surgeon expressly replaced the inner arch curvature. The distal anastomosis was routinely performed using felt stripes as reinforcement. The aortic root was addressed dependently on the presence of entry tears below the sinotubular junction, on the depth of the dissection in the sinus valsalvae, on the involvement of the coronary arteries and on the aortic valve morphology. In the absence of these conditions, big effort was made to repair the aortic root, mainly through commissure resuspension, glueing of the dissected aortic walls and sealing of the new sinotubular junction with felt sutures. In case of massive disruption, the root was replaced.\nSelective cerebral perfusion strategies\nThe setting of ACP considered a 10 ml/kg/min flow through the right axillary artery in case of uACP, with additional direct cannulation of the left common carotid artery for bACP.\nIn contrast, RCP was established after insertion of a standard cannula for bicaval cannulation in the superior caval vein and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) arrest. Target of RCP was a\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ejcts/article/62/5/ezac214/6565841 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\ncentral venous pressure between 30 and 40 mmHg, meaning in the majority of cases a 500 ml/min flow through a separate pump. The azygos vein was not routinely clamped during RCP. Intraoperative monitoring of the selective cerebral perfusion through near infra-red spectroscopy was not available for all patients, since it was routinely performed starting from 2013. It is to mention that RCP was mainly performed in the first period object of this study (2000\u20132013) and was gradually replaced by ACP strategies in the following years (Fig. 2). The selection of a certain selective cerebral perfusion, when all the three strategies were available, was made according to individual preference of the operating surgeon, anatomy and intraoperative course. In case of expected long circulatory arrest times or significant perfusion differences between the 2 hemispheres (according to clinical/radiological signs of malperfusion or near infra-red spectroscopy mismatch), bACP was preferred over uACP. If ACP was considered to be disadvantageous or even harmful, i.e. in cases of massive atherosclerosis or involvement of the supra-aortic vessels, RCP was performed."

Our institution is a single cardiac surgery\nunit, without a first aid department. This means that every ATAAD is referred to us from another hospital, where the initial diagnostic process takes place. The presence of acute preoperative neurologic dysfunction was clinically assessed at admission in our hospital. Preoperatively intubated and ventilated patients or cases requiring preoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation, for whom no information on neurologic status could be achieved, were excluded from the primary end point. These patients did not routinely undergo brain computed tomography (CT) before surgery to save time and try to restore adequate cerebral perfusion.

Retrograde cerebral perfusion, uACP and bACP show no statistically significant differences in terms of neurologic deficits and operative mortality, although RCP performed under lower core temperatures was associated with longer operative times and higher blood product transfusion rates. No adjustment for multiple comparison regarding these results was performed, since its impact would not have been relevant for our conclusions.\nThe importance of immediate surgery and the establishment of adequate cerebral perfusion to prevent brain injuries have been previously described [6, 7]. This aspect becomes clearer in presence of preoperative malperfusion and metabolic dysfunction [8, 9].\nSeveral international registries and expert consensus documents brought valuable information regarding presentation, optimal surgical treatment and postoperative outcome of ATAAD, underlining its multifactorial nature [10, 11]. In this constellation, great effort was made to define novel risk scores and classifications, to enhance a more comprehensive dissection assessment and facilitate standardized treatment approaches [12, 13]. The wide consensus regarding fast referral for surgery is in contrast to the lack of clear indications about which perfusion strategy\nshould be adopted during hypothermic circulatory arrest. Several retrospective analyses demonstrated the superiority of selective cerebral perfusion in adjunct to hypothermia in comparison to straight DHCA, though not showing remarkable differences between RCP and ACP [14, 15]. Moreover, DHCA was recognized as an independent risk factor for permanent neurologic injury, especially in case of prolonged circulatory arrest times [5, 16]. Based on these previously published findings, we limited our investigation to the comparison of RCP, uACP and bACP only, excluding straight DHCA. Safety and favourable results in terms of survival as well as neurologic outcomes for RCP were extensively documented for elective and for emergent aortic surgery [3, 17]. Nevertheless, experimental and metabolic investigations failed to confirm RCP\u2019s clinical results, since additional oxygen delivery and the flushing effect of embolic material could not be supported by animal models [18]. A recently published metaanalysis showed no relevant differences in terms of mortality and postoperative stroke between RCP and ACP [19]. Although the pooled effect sizes of this meta-analysis derive from remarkable 15 365 patients, the study is limited by the lack of discriminating between unilateral and bilateral ACP as well as by the inclusion of both elective aneurysms and acute aortic dissections. The\nFigure 3: Covariate balance plot showing the standardized mean differences of the variables involved in the matching process.

Our findings are also in line with this recommendation, since the RCP group under deep hypothermia experienced longer operative times, as well as higher red blood cell, concentrates and fresh frozen plasma transfusions. The use of uACP or bACP is still a matter of debate: uACP is favoured by many surgeons due to the possibility to switch from whole body to selective cerebral perfusion just by clamping of the innominate artery, avoiding extensive preparation and manipulation of supra-aortic vessels [20]. A recent analysis investigating uACP and bACP during ATAAD surgery showed an equal incidence of left hemispheric strokes and concluded that uACP provides comparable results to bACP [21]. This trend could not be confirmed in patients with prolonged circulatory arrest times (>50 min), where bACP was demonstrated to provide higher survival rates [22]. Considering the comparison of different perfusion strategies in the setting of ATAAD, the small numbers of patients from single centre experiences led to the adoption of statistical tools like propensity score matching, to adjust for possible confounders [23]. However, the available studies couple RCP and ACP only, with no differentiation between uACP and bACP.\nThe decision to exclude extensive arch surgery from our analysis had several reasons: it is the source of selection bias in terms of indication (arch entries, involvement of supra-aortic branches) and surgical strategy (bACP is adopted if prolonged circulatory arrest times are scheduled) but led to a small amount of bACP surgeries. The same considerations led also to the exclusion of partial arch replacements (open zone-1 or zone-2 anastomosis), since also these approaches need more preparation of the aortic arch and the reimplantation of at least 1 supra-aortic vessel, which is not the case for a simple zone-0 open anastomosis. The definition \u2018open zone-0 anastomosis\u2019 is mandatory due to the fact that, especially for the RCP group in the first period of this analysis, a more conservative aortic resection was performed, limited to the ascending aorta only. This led us to include the hemiarch resection into the matching process, achieving a final overall 90% rate for all the groups.\nDissection involvement of the common carotid arteries was shown to strongly affect neurologic outcomes [24, 25]. The inclusion of an anatomical definition of the dissection patterns in the supra-aortic vessels would have been of interest in the assessment of our neurologic end point according to the selective cerebral perfusion strategy employed but was not available for the whole cohort, especially for patients operated in the early 2000s. Similarly, we excluded the discrimination between DeBakey I and II dissections from the matching process due to the lack of\nTable 2: Intraoperative data\nN (%) Mean (SD)\nuACP (N = 62) bACP (N = 62) RCP (N = 62) P-Value\nPreoperative tamponade 10 (16.1) 14 (22.6) 13 (21.0) 0.65 Aortic regurgitation 0.10\nNo\u2013trace 11 (17.7) 13 (21.0) 7 (11.3) Mild 18 (29.0) 22 (35.5) 33 (53.2) Moderate 21 (33.9) 13 (21.0) 12 (19.4) Severe 12 (19.4) 14 (22.6) 10 (16.1)\nLVEF (%) 0.95 <30 1 (1.6) 1 (1.6) 1 (1.6) 30\u201340 1 (1.6) 0 (0.0) 1 (1.6) 40\u201350 2 (3.2) 4 (6.5) 3 (4.8) >50 58 (93.5) 57 (91.9) 57 (91.9) Operation time (min) 390 (333\u2013470) 377.5 (296.8\u2013449) 460 (369\u2013581.3) 0.001 Cardio\u2013pulmonary bypass time (min) 202 (166.5\u2013254.5) 197.5 (152.8\u2013254.5) 250.5 (210\u2013294.3) <0.001 Cross\u2013clamp time (min) 92.5 (78.3\u2013123) 103.5 (82\u2013133) 114 (88.8\u2013134.3) 0.04 Circulatory arrest time (min) 31.5 (21\u201341) 35.5 (29.5\u201344.3) 35.5 (25.8\u201341) 0.09 Reperfusion time (min) 75.5 (61.5\u2013110.3) 49 (33.5\u201388.5) 132 (93\u2013166.5) <0.001 Intraoperative mechanical circulatory support 2 (3.2) 0 (0.0) 3 (4.8) 0.24 Transfusion free surgery 1 (1.6) 3 (4.8) 0 (0.0) 0.17 Intraoperative RCC (units) 3 (2\u20135) 4 (2\u20136) 6 (2\u201310) 0.004 Intraoperative PLT (units) 4 (2\u20135) 4 (2\u20135) 2 (1\u20133) 0.002 Intraoperative FFP (units) 9 (6\u201315) 7 (4\u201312) 11 (6\u201321) <0.001 Primary arterial cannulation site <0.001\nCentral 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 2 (3.2) Innominate artery 2 (3.2) 2 (3.2) 0 (0.0) Right axillary artery 60 (96.8) 60 (96.8) 6 (9.7) Femoral artery 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 54 (87.1)\nOperation temperature ( C) 27.5 (24\u201328) 28 (26\u201328) 16 (16\u201317) <0.001 Root reconstruction 33 (53.2) 25 (40.3) 32 (51.6) 0.29 Root replacement 22 (35.5) 22 (35.5) 18 (29.0) 0.68 Hemiarch anastomosis 56 (90.3) 56 (90.3) 57 (91.9) 0.94 Concomitant procedure 10 (16.1) 8 (12.9) 5 (8.1) 0.39 Revision for bleeding 8 (12.9) 15 (24.2) 18 (29.0) 0.08\nbACP: bilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion; FFP: fresh frozen plasma; LVEF: left ventricular ejection fraction; PLT: platelets; RCC: red cell concentrate; RCP: retrograde cerebral perfusion; SD: standard deviation; uACP: unilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion.\nC O\nN V\nEN TI\nO N\nA L\nA O\nR TI C SU R G ER Y\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ejcts/article/62/5/ezac214/6565841 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\ninformation for the older patients and the fact that the surgical strategy would not differ considering an open zone-0 anastomosis, which is the standard treatment in both scenarios. The matching process involved several preoperative and intraoperative variables which were shown to strongly affect outcomes in the available literature, with great attention to preoperative haemodynamic condition and malperfusion [12, 16, 26]. After matching, the 3 subgroups present a rough 20% rate of both preoperative neurological deficit and shock, with any sign of malperfusion in 40.3%, 46.8% and 50.0% of patients for uACP, RCP and bACP, respectively, without significant differences between the groups. Operative times were not included in the matching process, since the need for deeper temperatures in our RCP setting was associated with longer CPB and reperfusion times. The same applied for arterial cannulation site since the right axillary artery was the primary cannulation site for ACP in over 90% of patients and just 11% for RCP, where femoral cannulation was the preferred strategy (86.3%). This could be the source of confounders in terms of neurologic outcome, taken into account that axillary cannulation is associated with a lower stroke rate and retrograde femoral perfusion has been questioned due to potential expansion of the false lumen and inferior long-term survival [27]. Similarly, operative temperature could not be included in the matching process, because of the absence of overlapping between all the 3 strategies in terms of cooling protocol. Although never performed at our institution, it would be valuable to investigate RCP at moderate hypothermia for a simple hemiarch anastomosis, to finally extrapolate the effect of selective cerebral perfusion irrespective of operative temperature.\nNeurologic outcome and mortality rates represented our study end-points: cerebral operation related NPOND was 11.3%, 11.3% and 12.9% (P-value = 0.95) and 30-day mortality 14.5%, 17.7% and 17.7% (P-value = 0.86) for uACP, bACP and RCP, respectively. Particular attention was paid to the definition of NPOND: we\nbelieve that the comparison of different perfusion strategies should be based on the evaluation of postoperative cerebral deficits directly connected to the type A operation only. Based on this statement, acute preoperative neurologic deficits and postoperative deficits arising from revisions/reinterventions, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or stroke/cerebral bleeding occurring after a first normal neurologic assessment following narcosis termination led to their exclusion from our primary end-point.\nOn this basis, the above mentioned 11.3\u201312.9% rate of cerebral operation-related NPOND represents a solid confirmation regarding the comparable cerebral outcomes of uACP, bACP and RCP during open zone-0 anastomosis for ATAAD."

            "text": "This analysis is limited by its retrospective nature and the singlecentre experience. Moreover, the investigation on the relatively small amount of patients after propensity score matching leads to limited statistical power, which may have influenced our results and conclusions.\nAlthough all groups were well balanced in regard to most relevant preoperative and intraoperative variables and confounders, a residual bias cannot be precluded, also considering the different temporal distribution of the investigated perfusion strategies. The lack of information on aortic involvement in preoperative CT scan is certainly a major limitation. Furthermore, the analysis is limited by the different surgical setting of the 3 selective cerebral perfusion strategies, which does not allow to match for operative temperature, arterial cannulation site and operative times. All these variables are ultimately intrinsic components of each selective cerebral perfusion strategy. In order to state differences between the groups, it would be preferrable to adjust for multiple comparison (i.e. Bonferroni\u2019s correction).
