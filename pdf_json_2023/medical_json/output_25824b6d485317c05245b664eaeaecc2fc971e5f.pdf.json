    "abstractText": "The introduction of high-sensitivity cardiac troponins (hs-cTn) T and I and its analytical superiority translated within the last years into a clinical superiority in the early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In patients presenting with suspected AMI, beyond the presence or absence of AMI, four clinical variables seem to impact hs-cTn concentrations: age, sex, renal dysfunction, and time from chest pain onset.2\u20135 And from all of them, sex has attracted the highest attention, and the idea of using sex-specific cut-off values (instead of uniform ones) to identify patients with AMI has been raised. Several prospective studies assessing the magnitude of using sexspecific cut-off levels for hs-cTnT showed only a negligible number of patients reclassified as compared with the use of a uniform cut-off level, obviating the need to adjust cut-off values.4,6\u20138 Controversies remain for hs-cTnI, which seem at least in part related to its rather high uniform 99th percentile recommended by the manufacturer. Based on these inconclusive data, recommendations of current guidelines are not consistent; while the universal definition of MI recommends sex-specific cut-off values, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) clinical practice guidelines recommend to continue using uniform cut-off values, and the American ones do not specify. In this issue of the EHJ-ACVC, the important observations reported by Lehmacher et al. are yet another important piece in the puzzle of sex and the use of hs-cTn for the diagnosis of AMI. Among this large cohort (n = 2718) of patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected AMI, clinical data and levels of hs-cTn T and I at presentation and after 3 h were collected. Final diagnoses were adjudicated according to the universal definition of MI, evaluating uniform and sex-specific 99th percentiles as diagnostic cut-offs following the ESC 0/ 3 h algorithm. Their analyses found that using the uniform cut-off value for hs-cTnT provides a very high safety to diagnose AMI with a negative predictive value (NPV) of nearly 100%. The uniform values for different hs-cTnI assays (Architect, Atellica, and Pathfast) also showed a high safety with NPVs around 98%. Regarding efficacy, positive predictive values (PPV) were overall also comparable (ranging from 67 to 76%). When assessing the use of sex-specific cut-offs, no major changes were observed among all assays resulting in a comparable diagnostic accuracy to the uniform ones. Similarly, when evaluating the prognostic value of hs-cTn values above the 99th percentile to predict long-term events, the use of sexspecific instead of uniform cut-offs did not reveal any benefit. Overall, these novel insights suggest that there is no clear evidence for a positive effect of using sex-specific cut-offs in clinical practice and hence cannot clearly be recommended for diagnostic workup and risk estimation in patients with suspected AMI. Until the moment, most studies4,6\u20138 were consistent with these results and did not show any relevant readjudication of diagnoses and no differences in terms of prognosis, failing to show any advantage for the use of hs-cTnT sex-specific values. However, as mentioned for hs-cTnI, the evidence was less clear. More recent results from the High-STEACS Investigators showed an increase in the detection of women with myocardial injury when using hs-cTnI sex-specific values compared to cTn. Despite these sex-specific differences, the use of sex-specific values did not translate into an improvement in management or outcomes, corroborating again the lack of evidence for sex-specific values. Although in the present study the results seem to extend this message to the use of uniform cut-off values in the diagnosis of AMI also for hs-cTnI, an important limitation needs to be highlighted as mentioned by the authors. It is the fact that the diagnostic accuracy of the three hs-cTnI assays was based on the final diagnosis adjudicated on the basis of hs-cTnT concentrations. Consequently, as studies continue to investigate providing more robust evidence to corroborate these results, the current results seem to support the recommendation of not implementing sex-specific cut-off values in clinical practice.",
