1. **Investigate the impact of different handcrafted feature extraction techniques on the performance of the hybrid approach.** The paper uses DSURF and HOG features, but there are many other handcrafted feature extraction techniques that could be explored. For example, one could investigate the use of texture features, shape features, or a combination of different feature types.


2. **Explore different strategies for integrating handcrafted features and CNNs.** The paper uses a simple concatenation approach to integrate handcrafted features and CNN features. However, there are other strategies that could be explored, such as feature selection, feature weighting, or multi-stream architectures.


3. **Investigate the use of deep learning techniques for handcrafted feature extraction.** Instead of using traditional handcrafted feature extraction techniques, one could use deep learning techniques to learn features directly from the data. This could potentially lead to more discriminative and robust features.


4. **Develop a hybrid approach that can segment brain tumors from different imaging modalities.** The paper focuses on MRI scans, but brain tumors can also be imaged using other modalities, such as CT scans or PET scans. A hybrid approach that can segment brain tumors from multiple imaging modalities could be more accurate and robust than an approach that only uses a single modality.


5. **Investigate the use of the hybrid approach for other medical image segmentation tasks.** The paper focuses on brain tumor segmentation, but the hybrid approach could also be used for other medical image segmentation tasks, such as lung nodule segmentation, liver segmentation, or kidney segmentation.
