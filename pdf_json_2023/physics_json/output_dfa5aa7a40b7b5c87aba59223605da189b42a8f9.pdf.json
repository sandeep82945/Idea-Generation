    "abstractText": "Black cumin seeds and seed oil have long been used in traditional foods and medicine in South Asian, Middle Eastern and Mediterranean countries and are valuable flavor ingredients. An important ingredient of black cumin is the small molecule thymoquinone (TQ), which manifests low toxicity and potential therapeutic activity against a wide number of diseases including diabetes, cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, the antioxidant activities of black seed oil, TQ and a related molecule found in black cumin, thymohydroquinone (THQ), were measured using a direct electrochemical method to experimentally evaluate their superoxide scavenging action. TQ and the black seed oil showed good superoxide scavenging ability, while THQ did not. Density Functional Theory (DFT) computational methods were applied to arrive at a chemical mechanism describing these results, and confirmed the experimental Rotating Ring Disk Electrode (RRDE) findings that superoxide oxidation to O2 by TQ is feasible, in contrast with THQ, which does not scavenge superoxide. Additionally, a thorough inquiry into the unusual cyclic voltammetry pattern exhibited by TQ was studied and was associated with formation of a 1:1 TQ-superoxide radical species, [TQ-O2]\u2022. DFT calculations reveal this radical species to be involved in the \u03c0-\u03c0 mechanism describing TQ reactivity with superoxide. The crystal structures of TQ and THQ were analyzed, and the experimental data reveal the presence of stacking intermolecular interactions that can be associated with formation of the radical species, [TQ-O2]\u2022. All three of these methods were essential for us to arrive at a chemical mechanism that explains TQ antioxidant activity, that incorporates intermolecular features found in the crystal structure and which correlates with the measured superoxide scavenging activity.",

Historical evidence of its use by ancient civilizations in those areas exists and seeds of the plant (black cumin) were even found in King Tutankhamen\u2019s tomb [1]. Today, populations in those geographical locations still use the black seeds and the related oil, containing the phytochemicals thymoquinone (TQ) and thymohydroquinone (THQ), in traditional foods as valuable flavor ingredients and for medicinal purposes, ingested with food or honey [1,2]. The main active phytochemicals in the seeds and oil include several monoterpenes, TQ (by far, the highest concentration), THQ, p-cymene, carvacrol and thymol [3]. Additionally, black cumin seed oil is rich in nutritionally beneficial fatty acids such as linoleic acid (57.71%) and oleic acid (24.46%) [2]. As with many agricultural materials, black seeds and the related cold-pressed oil show compositional variation depending on the area of cultivation [4].\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 607. https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12030607 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antioxidants\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 607 2 of 17\nImportantly, black seeds and their oil have demonstrated widespread action against numerous diseases. Because the low toxicity and potential therapeutic activity of TQ is notable, including diseases such as diabetes, cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, it has been the subject of many review articles [5\u20137]. Recently, TQ therapeutic activity has extended to include its use as a viable treatment against Covid-19 [8]. The presence of TQ and THQ in other plant species besides N. Sativa, including the Thymus vulgaris L. and Origanum species, is confirmed [5,9]. Studies on the biosynthesis of TQ and THQ in Lamiaceae established that the monoterpenes, thymol and carvacrol, are used to produce THQ by cytochrome P-450 enzymes, CYP76S40 or CYP736A300, which then is converted to TQ [10]. An objective of this study was to obtain chemical data to help clarify the relationship between the antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties of these substances and to gain insight into the chemical mechanisms underlying the therapeutic benefits of these phytochemical ingredients. We investigated the crystal and molecular structures of the small molecules TQ and THQ, as this method also reveals information regarding intermolecular interactions among neighboring molecules. We measured the antioxidant activity of black seed oil, TQ and THQ using the RRDE and one-electrode cyclic voltammetry electrochemical methods to obtain information about scavenging properties. Last, we used DFT methods to describe electronic properties since these are related to a molecule\u2019s ability to donate and/or receive electron density and its antioxidant capability. These computational methods were essential for us to arrive at a superoxide scavenging chemical mechanism that incorporates intermolecular features found in the crystal structure and which correlates with the measured superoxide scavenging activity."

Equipment 2.2.1. Electrochemistry\nA Pine Research WaveDriver 20 bipotentiostat with the Modulated Speed Electrode Rotator was used to perform the hydrodynamic voltammetry at a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) as well as cyclic voltammetry (CV). The working electrode is the AFE6R2 gold disk and gold ring rotator tip (Pine Research, Durham, NC, USA) combined with a coiled platinum wire counter electrode and a reference electrode consisting of an AgCl coated silver wire immersed in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) in dry DMSO in a fritted glass tube. The electrodes were placed in a five-neck electrochemical cell together with means for either bubbling or blanketing the solution with gas. Voltammograms were collected using Aftermath software provided by Pine Research. Careful cleaning of the electrodes was performed by polishing with 0.05 \u00b5m alumina-particle suspension (Allied High Tech Products, Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA) on a moistened polishing microcloth to eliminate potential film formation [11]. Cyclic voltammetry was performed using the same electrodes and cell.\n2.2.2.

Hydrodynamic Voltammetry (RRDE)\nStock clear light-yellow 0.03 M solution of TQ (0.0492 g in 10 mL) and clear colorless 0.03 M solution THQ (0.0498 g in 10 mL), in anhydrous DMSO (99.9% purity), were used in trials, whereas black seed oil was directly introduced in the electrochemical cell. For the experiment, a solution of 0.1 M TBAB electrolyte in anhydrous DMSO was bubbled for 5 min with a dry O2/N2 (35%/65%) gas mixture to establish the dissolved oxygen level in the electrochemical cell of 50 mL. The Au/Au disc electrode was then rotated at 1000 rpm and potential sweep applied to the disk from 0.2 V to \u22121.2 V and then back to 0.2 V while the ring was held constant at 0.0 V; the disk voltage sweep rate was set to 25 mV/s. The molecular oxygen reduction peak (reaction 1) is observed around \u22120.6 V, at the disk electrode; the oxidation current (reaction 2) occurs at the ring electrode. An initial blank, in the absence of an antioxidant, was run on this solution and the ratio of the ring/disk current was calculated as the \u201cefficiency\u201d. This blank efficiency was found to be about 20%. Next, an antioxidant aliquot was added, the solution bubbled with the gas mixture for 5 min, the voltammogram was rerecorded, and efficiency obtained. In this way, the rate at which increasing concentrations of antioxidant scavenge the generated superoxide radicals during the electrochemical reaction is determined as each additional antioxidant aliquot is added. Results from each run were collected on Aftermath software and represented as voltammograms showing current vs. potential graphs that were later analyzed using Microsoft Excel. The aliquots used are indicated in related RRDE graphs. Ultimately, the slope of the overall decrease in efficiency with addition of antioxidant serves as a quantitative measure of the antioxidant activity of each compound. Any decrease in the collection efficiency is expected to be due to the amount of superoxide removed by the antioxidant. In an RRDE voltammetry experiment, the generation of the superoxide radicals occurs at the disk electrode while the oxidation of the residual superoxide radicals (that have not been scavenged by the antioxidant) occurs at the ring electrode.\nReaction 1: Reduction of molecular oxygen at the disk electrode\nDisk Reaction O2 + e\u2212 \u2192 O2\u2022\u2212 (1)\nReverse Reaction 2: Oxidation of superoxide radicals at the ring electrode\nRing Reaction O2\u2022\u2212 \u2192 O2 + e\u2212 (2)\n2.3.2. Cyclic Voltammetry\nOn completion of the RRDE study of TQ, CV was performed both in the presence and absence of oxygen dissolved in the DMSO solvent in order to further study the reactions occurring at the electrode surfaces."

DFT Study 3. .1. Thymoquinone\nAfter X-ray at mic coordinates of TQ were input in Materials Studio (Dmol3) quantum mechanical program, geometry optimization was applied and the resulting minimum energy structure is shown in Figure 4A. Single bonds in the quinone ring are in the range 1.47\u201321.501 \u00c5, obviously longer than the two double bonds, 1.356 \u00c5 (compared with X-ray values of 1.473\u20131.493 \u00c5 (single) and 1.337\u20131.342 \u00c5 (double)). Next, we studied the TQ structural modifications after a superoxide radical was \u03c0-\u03c0 placed at van der Waals separation (3.50 \u00c5) between quinone and superoxide centroids. DFT geometry minimization, Figure 4B, shows the superoxide being more distant, 3.579 \u00c5 apart, and with the initial superoxide O-O bond length distance of 1.373 \u00c5 shortening to 1.283 \u00c5, which rather corresponds to the O2 double bond distance. Meanwhile, the TQ ring bond lengths become modified, for instance, C=C double bonds become longer, 1.372 \u00c5 (from initial values shown in Figure 4A 1.356 \u00c5), while the quinone single C-C bonds become 0.02\u20130.03 \u00c5 shorter. Shorter single bonds and longer double bonds can be associated with ring aromatization, suggesting the unpaired electron of superoxide is donated to the quinone ring. This result has already been observed by us in related polyphenols scavenging superoxide [21]. The electron captured by the ring also has an effect on the C=O bond lengths as they become elongated by 0.03 \u00c5. We call this process (a).\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 607 7 of 17\nFrom Figure 4 we conclude that superoxide oxidation (and O2 formation) by TQ is feasible.\nAntioxidants\u00a02023,\u00a012,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 8\u00a0 of\u00a0 18\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a04.\u00a0TQ\u00a0superoxide\u00a0scavenging\u00a0DFT\u00a0calculations.\u00a0H\u00a0atoms\u00a0are\u00a0light\u00a0blue\u00a0to\u00a0avoid\u00a0white\u00a0back\u2010 ground\u00a0misperception.\u00a0 (A)\u00a0Minimized\u00a0TQ\u00a0molecule\u00a0obtained\u00a0after\u00a0 input\u00a0of\u00a0corresponding\u00a0X\u2010ray\u00a0 coordinates.\u00a0(B)\u00a0Superoxide\u00a0was\u00a0\u03c0\u2010\u03c0\u00a0placed\u00a0(3.50\u00a0\u00c5)\u00a0above\u00a0ring\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0A,\u00a0and\u00a0upon\u00a0DFT\u00a0mini\u2010 mization\u00a0both\u00a0moieties\u00a0became\u00a0more\u00a0distant,\u00a03.579\u00a0\u00c5,\u00a0while\u00a0ring\u00a0C\u2010C\u00a0bond\u00a0lengths\u00a0were\u00a0modified\u00a0 due\u00a0to\u00a0electron\u00a0transferred\u00a0from\u00a0superoxide\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0ring\u00a0and\u00a0O\u2010O\u00a0bond\u00a0length\u00a0shortens\u00a0to\u00a01.283\u00a0\u00c5.\u00a0 (C)\u00a0Structure\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0A\u00a0has\u00a0a\u00a0proton\u00a0van\u00a0der\u00a0Waals\u00a0separated\u00a0(2.60\u00a0\u00c5)\u00a0from\u00a0one\u00a0O(carbonyl).\u00a0(D)\u00a0 DFT\u00a0outcome\u00a0of\u00a0structure\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0C,\u00a0plus\u00a0an\u00a0additional\u00a0proton\u00a02.60\u00a0\u00c5\u00a0separated\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0second\u00a0 O(carbonyl).\u00a0(E)\u00a0DFT\u00a0outcome\u00a0of\u00a0structure\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0D\u00a0whose\u00a0charge\u00a0is\u00a02+,\u00a0showing\u00a0two\u00a0C\u2010OH\u00a0moi\u2010 eties.\u00a0(F)\u00a0A\u00a0superoxide\u00a0radical\u00a0was\u00a0\u03c0\u2010\u03c0\u00a0placed\u00a0in\u00a0E,\u00a0and\u00a0DFT\u00a0shows\u00a0formation\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0radical\u00a0[thy\u2010 mohydroquinone\u2010\u03b7\u2010O2]\u2022+,\u00a0with\u00a0separation\u00a0between\u00a0centroids\u00a0of\u00a02.697\u00a0\u00c5.\u00a0 .

(C) Structure shown in A has a proton van der Waals separated (2.60 \u00c5) from one O(carbonyl). (D) DFT outcome of structure shown in C, plus an additional proton 2.60 \u00c5 separated from the second O(carbonyl). (E) DFT outcome of structure shown in D whose charge is 2+, showing two C-OH\noieties. (F) A superoxide radical was \u03c0-\u03c0 placed in E, and DFT shows formation of the radical [thymohydroquinone-\u03b7-O2]\u2022+, with separation between centroids of 2.697 \u00c5.\nHowever, since TQ has no hydroxyls available, an alternative process (b) can be envisioned involving interaction between the quinone and available protons. This route can induce reduction of a C=O carbonyl to a C-OH moiety and has been described for the quinone natural product embelin [22]. The initial state of this process is shown in\nFigure 4C, where a proton is placed at van der Waals separation from the O(carbonyl), 2.60 \u00c5 (1.20 \u00c5 + 1.40 \u00c5, for H and O van der Waals radii, respectively), Figure 4A. After DFT minimization, Figure 4D shows the proton captured by the TQ, O-H bond length = 0.986 \u00c5, and lengthening of the corresponding C-O bond, 1.311 \u00c5, compared to initial 1.241 \u00c5 in\nFigure 4A, thus confirming C-OH formation. Indeed, Figure 4D shows the input for the\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 607 8 of 17\nnext DFT calculation, i.e., the approach of an additional proton to the second O(carbonyl) in TQ, located initially at 2.60 \u00c5, and which results in the energy minimum moiety shown in Figure 4E, a 2+ charged polyphenol (from 2 captured protons), and having 2 hydroxyls, [THQ]2+. As observed in Figure 4B, superoxide is able to transfer its unpaired electron to the TQ ring, and we can expect that the dicationic polyphenol in Figure 4E will permit an even easier electron transfer to the ring. Indeed, this happens and the DFT outcome after energy minimization of the initial structure, a superoxide \u03c0-\u03c0 posed at 3.50 \u00c5 (Figure 4E), is shown in Figure 4F, having shorter separation between stacked centroids, 2.697 \u00c5. Upon an additional \u03c0-\u03c0 attack by a second superoxide on the opposite side of the polyphenol ring, this radical also binds to the ring with a longer separation, 2.987 \u00c5, Figure 5. This resulting thymohydroquinone-\u03b7-2O2 complex is a neutral species with aromatic character, as shown by the ring C-C bonds in the range 1.394\u20131.418 \u00c5; this is process (b). Attempts to extract one H(hydroxyl) from the thymohydroquinone-\u03b7-2O2 structure shown in Figure 5, by an additional superoxide via \u03c3 attack, were not successful, as the possible expected radical product {[thymohydrosemiquinone-\u03b7-2O2]\u2022 HO2\u2212} is +4.3 Kcal/mol higher than the reagent, thus indicating no further reactivity of the thymohydroquinone-\u03b7-2O2 complex.

According to our DFT results, in TQ scavenging of superoxide, the reaction (3) reactants ar involved, since two protons (Figure 4C,D) are captured as well as two superoxide radicals (Figures 4F and 5), but the products of reaction (3), O2 and H2O2, are not produced by process (b). However, the independent process (a), shown in Figure 4B, suggests O2 formation. In any case, H2O2 is not produced, and so TQ does not mimic SOD action, unlike behavior recently described for some polyphenols [23]. We conclude that TQ scavenging of superoxide can be d scribed only in terms of stoichiometric reactions.\n3.2.2.

A superoxide \u03c3-oriented towards one H(hydroxyl), initially at van der Waals separation 2.60 \u00c5, results in a structure\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 607 9 of 17\nhaving shorter separation, 1.583 \u00c5, Figure 6B.

A comparison between the results of both minimizations showed \u2206G of 0.3 kcal/mol, indicating no product feasibility. The \u03c0-\u03c0 attack was also analyzed after placing superoxide on top of Figure 6A, and DFT minimization showed both reagents rejected, Figure 4D. We conclude that THQ does not scavenge superoxide.\nAntioxidants\u00a02023,\u00a012,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 9\u00a0 of\u00a0 18\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Figure\u00a05.\u00a0An\u00a0additional\u00a0superoxide\u00a0(large\u00a0stick\u00a0style)\u00a0was\u00a0\u03c0\u2010\u03c0\u00a0placed\u00a0below\u00a0the\u00a0structure\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0 Figure\u00a04F\u00a0and\u00a0its\u00a0DFT\u00a0minimization\u00a0shows\u00a0the\u00a0neutral\u00a0final\u00a0complex\u00a0[thymohydroquinone\u2010\u03b7\u2010O2],\u00a0 obtained\u00a0for\u00a0process\u00a0(b).\u00a0\n3.2.2.\u00a0Thymohydroquinone\u00a0 THQ\u00a0X\u2010ray\u00a0atomic\u00a0coordinates\u00a0were\u00a0treated\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0similar\u00a0way\u00a0with\u00a0Dmol3.\u00a0The\u00a0DFT\u00a0\nenergy\u00a0minimum\u00a0structure\u00a0Figure\u00a06A\u00a0shows\u00a0aromatic\u00a0ring\u00a0distances\u00a0(1.40 1.41\u00a0\u00c5),\u00a0which\u00a0 can\u00a0be\u00a0compared\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0corresponding\u00a0X\u2010ray\u00a0values\u00a0(1.37 1.41\u00a0\u00c5).\u00a0A\u00a0superoxide\u00a0\u03c3\u2010ori\u2010 ented\u00a0towards\u00a0one\u00a0H(hydroxyl),\u00a0initially\u00a0at\u00a0van\u00a0der\u00a0Waals\u00a0separation\u00a02.60\u00a0\u00c5,\u00a0results\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0 structure\u00a0having\u00a0shorter\u00a0separation,\u00a01.583\u00a0\u00c5,\u00a0Figure\u00a06B.\u00a0This\u00a0structure\u00a0was\u00a0compared\u00a0with\u00a0 the\u00a0one\u00a0obtained\u00a0after\u00a0posing\u00a0a\u00a0HO2\u2212\u00a0anion\u00a0near\u00a0the\u00a0corresponding\u00a0thymohydrosemiqui\u2010 none\u00a0radical\u00a0(a\u00a0calculatio \u00a0describing\u00a0the\u00a0potential\u00a0expected\u00a0product),\u00a0w ich\u00a0resulted\u00a0in\u00a0 a\u00a0slightly\u00a0shorter\u00a0H O\u00a0separation,\u00a01.564\u00a0\u00c5,\u00a0Figure\u00a06C.\u00a0A\u00a0comparison\u00a0between\u00a0the\u00a0results\u00a0 of\u00a0both\u00a0minimizations\u00a0showed\u00a0\u0394G\u00a0of\u00a00.3\u00a0kcal/mol,\u00a0indicating\u00a0no\u00a0product\u00a0feasibility.\u00a0The\u00a0 \u03c0\u2010\u03c0\u00a0attack\u00a0was\u00a0also\u00a0analyzed\u00a0after\u00a0placing\u00a0superoxide\u00a0on\u00a0top\u00a0of\u00a0Figure\u00a06A,\u00a0and\u00a0DFT\u00a0min\u2010 imization\u00a0sho ed\u00a0both\u00a0reagents\u00a0rejected,\u00a0Fig re\u00a04D.\u00a0We\u00a0conclude\u00a0that\u00a0THQ\u00a0does\u00a0not\u00a0scav\u2010 enge\u00a0superox de.\u00a0\n3.3.

We analyzed the peaks seen in Figure 10, starting with the first reduction peak (non-reversible) at about \u22120.30 to \u22120.35 V and assigned it to incorporatio of an electron into TQ (TQ + e-\u2192 [TQ]\u2022).

CV of TQ 0.00074 M solution (1280 \u00b5L aliquot) purged with N2 gas showing evidence of incomplete purging of the O2.\nThe collection efficiency for the TQ RRDE experiment (Figure 8) is anomalous, showing an initial decrease in efficiency through the first four TQ additions (as normally observed), but then the efficiency increased with each further addition of TQ aliquot, which has never been observed in previous studies [22,24,25,26,27]. To clarify this behavior of TQ, cyclic voltammetry of an RRDE solution yielded the voltammogram in Figure 10. Under these conditions, the reduction of oxygen to generate superoxide, reaction (1), \u22120.60 V, as well as the reverse reaction (2) (oxidation of superoxide), \u22120.30 V, was previously examined by analyzing a blank solution (without antioxidant), Figure 12 [24]. We analyzed the peaks seen in Figure 10, starting with the first reduction peak\n(non-reversible) at about \u22120.30 to \u22120.35 V an.\nwith bubbled nitrogen, in Figure 11, the peak was strongly decreased, consistent with decreasing O2, although not completely eliminated because of the presence of some\nresidual non-purged oxygen. Thus, the anomalous increase in efficiency, Figure 8, is not\nassociated with antioxidant features of TQ, and contrary to results seen for previously\nstudied scavengers [22,24,25,26,27]. Rather, this increase in efficiency is due to\nincreasing [TQ-O2]\u2212\u2022 concentration, formed as TQ aliquots are added and react with\nbubbled O2.\nHowever, it is interesting to compare the peaks associated with reactions (1) and (2)\nin Figure 10, as reaction (2) peak height (indicated by short vertical arrow) is shorter\nthan that of reaction (1) (represented by longer horizontal arrow). For comparison,\nFigure 12 shows a typical blank, also using one working electrode, where both peak\nheights are seen to be equal. Thus, in Figure 10, the difference in peak height between the amount of\npeak oxidation in Figure 9, to give TQ plus O2.\nHowever, it is interesting to compare the peaks associated with reactions (1) and (2) in\nFigure 10, as reaction (2) peak height (indicate by short vertical arrow) is sho ter than that of reaction (1) (represented by longer horizontal arrow).

Thus, in Figure 10, the difference in peak h ight between the amount of superoxide present at the oxidation peak and the amount of superoxide at the reduction peak is due to TQ scavenging of superoxide. These feat res ave been characterized in a previous\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 607 13 of 17\nstudy using both electrochemical methods, RRDE and CV [24]. The interference of radical [TQ-O2]\u2212\u2022 seems not to be important at low concentrations of TQ, as seen in the first five data points in Figure 8. These initial values are plotted in Figure 9 to obtain the efficiency at low concentrations; the related slope (slope = \u22122.11 \u00d7 104) for the linear expression y = \u221221104x + 20.9 (R2 = 0.9965), is a good indicator of superoxide scavenging ability of TQ. We conclude that RRDE experiments on TQ show a mixed effect: on one hand, at low concentrations, TQ is able to scavenge superoxide, and shows the expected decreasing efficiency while at higher TQ concentrations, an unexpected increase in efficiency can be associated with formation of the [TQ-O2]\u2212\u2022 radical. This radical species is oxidized after reversing the potential at about \u22120.45 V in the electrochemistry experiment using one working electrode, or alternatively, is detected at the ring electrode, whose setting is 0.0 V in the RRDE experiment. Table 3 shows electrochemical RRDE data of other polyphenols analyzed previously. The slope of TQ, \u22122.11 \u00d7 104 falls between chrysin and eriodyctiol, but is closer in value to the latter.\nOur results support earlier investigations that describe TQ superoxide scavenging ability [28] as well as a thorough inquiry on the unusual cyclic voltammetry pattern shown by TQ [29].\n3.3.2. Thymohydroquinone\nTHQ was also explored with the RRDE method, and results are shown in Figure 14. There was no variation in disk and ring current, and so THQ does not scavenge superoxide, in agreement with the results of the DFT study described earlier, and so the data show no change from the blank run, both below and above the potential axis, indicating unmodified reaction (1) and (2), respectively. In other words, THQ has no effect on the RRDE outcome.\nAntioxidants\u00a02023,\u00a012,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 14\u00a0 of\u00a0 18\u00a0 \u00a0\nTable\u00a03.\u00a0RRDE\u00a0efficiency\u00a0slopes\u00a0of\u00a0various\u00a0polyphenols.\u00a0\nOur\u00a0results\u00a0support\u00a0earlier\u00a0 investigations\u00a0 that\u00a0describe\u00a0TQ\u00a0superoxide\u00a0scavenging\u00a0 ability\u00a0[28]\u00a0as\u00a0well\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0thorough\u00a0inquiry\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0unusual\u00a0cyclic\u00a0voltammetry\u00a0pattern\u00a0shown\u00a0 by\u00a0TQ\u00a0[29].\u00a0\n3.3.2.\u00a0Thymohydroquinone\u00a0 THQ\u00a0was\u00a0als \u00a0expl r d\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0RRDE\u00a0method,\u00a0and\u00a0results\u00a0are\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a014.\u00a0 There\u00a0was\u00a0no\u00a0variation\u00a0in\u00a0disk\u00a0and\u00a0ring\u00a0current,\u00a0and\u00a0so\u00a0THQ\u00a0does\u00a0not\u00a0scavenge\u00a0superox\u2010 ide,\u00a0in\u00a0agreement\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0results\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0DFT\u00a0study\u00a0described\u00a0earlier,\u00a0and\u00a0so\u00a0the\u00a0data\u00a0show\u00a0 no\u00a0change\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0blank\u00a0run,\u00a0both\u00a0below\u00a0and\u00a0above\u00a0the\u00a0potential\u00a0axis,\u00a0 indicating\u00a0un\u2010 modified\u00a0reaction\u00a0(1)\u00a0and\u00a0(2),\u00a0respectively.\u00a0In\u00a0other\u00a0words,\u00a0THQ\u00a0has\u00a0no\u00a0effect\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0RRDE\u00a0 outcome.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a014.\u00a0THQ\u00a0is\u00a0not\u00a0able\u00a0to\u00a0scavenge\u00a0superoxide,\u00a0as\u00a0no\u00a0variation\u00a0is\u00a0found\u00a0with\u00a0increasing\u00a0concen\u2010 tration\u00a0of\u00a0THQ.\u00a0\n3.3.3.\u00a0Black\u00a0Seed\u00a0Oil\u00a0 Black\u00a0seed\u00a0oil\u00a0was\u00a0also\u00a0analyzed,\u00a0and\u00a0its\u00a0RRDE\u00a0cyclovoltammetry\u00a0data\u00a0are\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0 Figure\u00a015.\u00a0Figure\u00a016\u00a0shows\u00a0decreasing\u00a0collection\u00a0efficiency\u00a0overall,\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0greatest\u00a0de\u2010 crease\u00a0at\u00a0low\u00a0concentrations.\u00a0Figure\u00a017\u00a0shows\u00a0the\u00a0collection\u00a0efficiency\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0first\u00a0four\u00a0ali\u2010 quots,\u00a0having\u00a0good\u00a0 linear\u00a0behavior\u00a0(y\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.0781x\u00a0+\u00a020.08,\u00a0R2\u00a0=\u00a00.9763),\u00a0demonstrating\u00a0a\u00a0 good\u00a0scavenging\u00a0ability\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0black\u00a0seed\u00a0oil.\u00a0 Earlier\u00a0RRDE\u00a0studies\u00a0by\u00a0our\u00a0group\u00a0on\u00a0another\u00a0cold\u2010pressed\u00a0vegetable\u00a0oil,\u00a0extra\u00a0virgin\u00a0 olive\u00a0oil\u00a0 [30],\u00a0 allow\u00a0us\u00a0 to\u00a0 compare\u00a0 the\u00a0 slope\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0RRDE\u00a0 efficiency\u00a0of\u00a0black\u00a0 seed\u00a0oil\u00a0 (\u22120.078)\u00a0and\u00a0that\u00a0of\u00a0extra\u00a0virgin\u00a0olive\u00a0oil\u00a0(\u22120.0838).\u00a0The\u00a0latter\u00a0is\u00a0characterized\u00a0by\u00a0a\u00a0linear\u00a0 trend\u00a0(y\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.0838x\u00a0+19.73,\u00a0R2\u00a0=\u00a00.99348)\u00a0for\u00a0all\u00a011\u00a0runs,\u00a0(aliquot\u00a0range\u00a00\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcL),\u00a0and\u00a0shows\u00a0 a\u00a0slightly\u00a0better\u00a0scavenging\u00a0of\u00a0superoxide\u00a0by\u00a0olive\u00a0oil.\u00a0\ni re 14. is ot able to scavenge superoxide, as no variation is found ith increasing concen-\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 607 14 of 17\n3.3.3.

            "text": "The molecular mechanisms that underlie the therapeutic effects of TQ are not completely understood, and literature reports show that TQ likely interacts with a number of receptors. Its low toxicity and the fact that TQ as well as the oil and seeds from which it is isolated have been used for thousands of years, make studying its therapeutic capacity appealing [6]. In this work, we have measured the superoxide scavenging ability of cold-pressed black cumin oil and two of its ingredients, TQ and THQ. Our results show that the oil and TQ are strong scavengers of the superoxide radical, whereas THQ has no effect on the scavenging, despite the presence of two para-hydroxyl groups. Structural X-ray diffraction data support subsequent DFT calculations that show a path of energetically feasible molecular transformations which corroborate cyclovoltammetry experimental features, i.e., the scavenging of superoxide by TQ, and no scavenging by THQ. The suggested stoichiometric reactivity of TQ when reacting with superoxide involves 1) direct \u03c0-\u03c0 attack, involving superoxide oxidation to produce O2 as a product, and 2) superoxide \u03c3 proton attack on a TQ O(carbonyl), which gets reduced to C-OH, and is not sensitive to further attack by superoxide. This theoretical assessment is confirmed using two cyclovoltammetry techniques, cyclic voltammetry and hydrodynamic voltammetry at an RRDE. Lastly, our work shows the efficacy of combining multidisciplinary approaches, including experimental X-ray crystallography and voltammetry as well as computational DFT methods, to provide understanding of the mechanism of action of small molecule antioxidants. This research supports further exploration of other natural products having important biomedical activities.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/antiox12030607/s1, Figure S1: Overlay of two molecules in the asymmetric unit.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, F.C. and M.R.; methodology, F.C., M.R. and S.B.; software, F.C.; validation, M.R., F.C. and S.B.; formal analysis, F.C., M.R., S.B., R.S. and S.K.; investigation, F.C.,\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 607 16 of 17\nM.R., R.S., M.H. and S.A.; data curation, F.C., S.B., R.S. and M.R.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, F.C.; writing\u2014review and editing, F.C. and M.R.; supervision, M.R.
