    "abstractText": "In this paper we analyze the theoretical properties of a stochastic representation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations defined in the framework of the modeling under location uncertainty (LU). This setup built from a stochastic version of the Reynolds transport theorem incorporates a so-called transport noise and involves several specific additional features such as a large scale diffusion term, akin to classical subgrid models, and a modified advection term arising from the spatial inhomogeneity of the small-scale velocity components. This formalism has been numerically evaluated in a series of studies with a particular interest on geophysical flows approximations and data assimilation. In this work we focus more specifically on its theoretical analysis. We demonstrate, through classical arguments, the existence of martingale solutions for the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations in LU form. We show they are pathwise and unique for 2D flows. We then prove that if the noise intensity goes to zero, these solutions converge, up to a subsequence in dimension 3, to a solution of the deterministic Navier-Stokes equation. similarly to the grid convergence property of well established large-eddies simulation strategies, this result allows us to give some guarantee on the interpretation of the LU Navier-Stokes equations as a consistent large-scale model of the deterministic Navier-Stokes equation.",

            "text": "For several years there has been a burst of activity to devise stochastic representations of fluid flow dynamics. These models are strongly motivated in particular by climate and weather forecasting issues [3, 18, 19, 28] and the need to provide accurate likely scenarios with proper uncertainty quantification as well as the necessity to build efficient methods for the coupling of data of ever increasing resolution with large-scale geophysical dynamical models. In the past decades, several schemes have been devised in that prospect. Multiplicative random forcing and randomization of parameters based on early turbulence studies on energy backscattering across scales [26, 29] have been proposed [7, 44] for weather forecasting. These schemes have not been designed within clear mathematical and physical derivation settings and consequently lack generality. They theoretically face uncontrolled variance increase and are hence mathematically not well posed. Due to this, a proper tuning of an eddy viscosity term must be realized to counterbalance the energy brought by the noise. The precise form that should take this additional eddy viscosity term remains unknown and often relies on debatable physical hypothesis such as the Boussinesq\u2019s assumption [43]. More problematically, random forcing defined outside any conservation principles may lead, even for low noise, to strong discrepancies with the fine resolution dynamics that is meant to be emulated [10]. This issue highlights indeed that two somewhat opposite\n1\ngoals are sought by stochastic parameterization. On the one hand, one wishes to augment the variability of coarse resolution systems, which is particularly desirable for data assimilation applications and uncertainty quantification, and on the other hand, to represent, as accurately as possible, coarse resolution of the geophysical dynamics. This latter goal is a large eddies simulation (LES) issue, while the first one seeks to avoid the traditional over-diffusive approaches associated to coarse scale simulations embedding classical subgrid models. A minimal mathematical requirement for satisfactory LES is that a weak solution of the LES scheme converges in some sense toward a weak solution of the fine-scale deterministic Navier-Stokes equations in 3D and toward the unique solution for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations. The convergence of some classical LES models toward the true fine scale dynamics is well known in the deterministic case [4, 20]. However, the question of convergence of stochastic parametrization toward solutions of the deterministic equations at the limit of vanishing noise is not always clear.\nRecently two different general modelling schemes have been proposed to derive systematically stochastic versions of fluid dynamical models. The first one is based on a Hamiltonian principle and enables to exhibit a circulation preserving representation of Euler equations [23]. This scheme has been analyzed in vorticity form [13] and has been assessed in several geophysical configuration approximations [11]. The second scheme, based also on stochastic transport, relies more directly on Reynolds transport theorem [31]. This scheme, constructed from the classical physical conservation laws preserves energy. It has been successfully applied to several geophysical models [1, 37, 38, 39], to the design of stochastic reduced order models [40, 41, 46] and to devise large eddies simulation models [8, 9, 24]. Beyond its construction the physical relevance of the LU scheme has been numerically assessed on several prototypical flow models [1, 5, 10]. The objective is here to check its mathematical consistency in terms of its well posedness and in terms of its ability to provide in some sense a converging stochastic representation of the Navier Stokes equations.\nThe two stochastic schemes based on transport noise, proposed in [23, 31], are meant to represent the flow at large scales and rely on a decomposition of the Lagrangian velocity in terms of a smooth-intime component and a strongly oscillating component. Nevertheless the question whether or not those schemes converge towards the deterministic Navier-Stokes solutions has not been yet answered. In this work we specifically focus on the second family of methods, referred to as, modelling under location uncertainty (LU) and provide an affirmative answer to this question. We show that LU Navier-Stokes equations admit martingale solutions (also called weak probabilistic solutions) in 3D and a unique strong solution - in the probabilistic sense - in 2D. Moreover, these solutions converge toward weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation in 3D and toward the unique solution in 2D. As such these results enable to consider the LU representation as a valid large-scale stochastic representation of flow dynamics that is more amenable to ensemble forecasting and data assimilation than deterministic model due to an improved variability. The Navier-Stokes equation with transport noise has been the object of many articles, starting with [6, 33]. However, none have considered the equations studied here and the limit of the noise going to zero has not been investigated.\nThe paper is structured as follows. We first briefly introduce the LU modelling and the form of the corresponding stochastic Navier-Stokes equations in this setting. The main convergence results will then be enunciated. Their rigorous proofs are then fully described in the following section."

            "text": "The LU formulation relies mainly on the following time-scale separation assumption of the flow:\ndXt = u(Xt, t) dt+ \u03c3(Xt, t) dWt, (1)\nwhere X is the Lagrangian displacement defined within the bounded domain S \u2282 Rd (d = 2 or 3) with smooth boundary, and u denotes the large-scale velocity that is both spatially and temporally correlated, while \u03c3dW is a highly oscillating unresolved component (also called noise term) that is only correlated in space.\nMore precisely, we consider a cylindrical Wiener process W on L2(S,Rd), the space of square integrable functions on S with values in Rd,\nW = \u2211\ni\u2208N\n\u03b2\u0302iei,\nwhere (ei)i\u2208N is a Hilbertian orthonormal basis of L 2(S,Rd) and (\u03b2\u0302i)i\u2208N is a sequence of independent standard brownian motions on a stochastic basis (\u2126,F , (Ft)t\u2208[0,T ],P) ([35]). The above does not converge in L2(S,Rd) but in any larger Hilbert space U such that the embedding of L2(S,Rd) into U is Hilbert-Schmidt.\nThe spatial structure of the noise is specified through a deterministic time dependent integral covariance operator \u03c3t defined from a bounded and symmetric kernel \u03c3\u0302:\n(\u03c3tf)(x) :=\n\u222b\nS\n\u03c3\u0302(x, y, t) f(y) dy, f \u2208 L2(S,Rd).\nFor each (x, y, t), \u03c3\u0302(x, y, t) is a d \u00d7 d symmetric tensor. Since \u03c3\u0302 is bounded in x, y and t, \u03c3t maps L2(S,Rd) into itself and is Hilbert-Schmidt. Then, the noise can be written as the Wiener process:\n\u03c3tWt = \u2211\ni\u2208N\n\u03b2\u0302it\u03c3tei,\nwhere the series converges in L2(S,Rd) almost surely and in Lp(\u2126) for all p \u2208 N and equation (1) should be understood in the It\u00f4 sense. To avoid, any confusion, we may further write the dependance of the Wiener process in terms of the other variables:\n\u03c3tWt(x, \u03c9) = \u2211\ni\u2208N\n\u03b2\u0302it(\u03c9)\u03c3tei(x),\nWe consider a divergence free noise:\n\u2207x \u00b7 \u03c3\u0302(x, y, t) = 0, x, y \u2208 S, t \u2265 0.\nAlso, for each t \u2208 R+, there exists (\u03c6n(t))n a complete orthogonal system composed of eigenfunctions of the covariance operator at each time t \u2208 R. It can be shown that there exists another sequence of independent standard brownian motions, on the same stochastic basis (\u2126,F , (Ft)t\u2208[0,T ],P) such that we have the representation:\n\u03c3tWt =\n\u221e\u2211\nk=0\n\u03c6k(t)\u03b2 k t .\nThis Gaussian random field is associated to the two-times, two-points covariance tensor given by\nQ(x, y, t, t\u2032) = E (\u03c3t dWt(x) \u03c3t\u2032 dWt\u2032(y)) =\n\u222b\nS\n\u03c3\u0302(x, z, t) \u03c3\u0302(z, y, t\u2032)dy \u03b4(t\u2212 t\u2032) ,\nwith the diagonal part (i.e one time auto-correlation), referred to, in the following, as the variance tensor, and denoted by\na(x, t) =\n\u222b\nS\n\u03c3\u0302(x, y, t) \u03c3\u0302(y, x, t) dy = \u221e\u2211\nk=0\n\u03c6k(x, t)\u03c6 T k (x, t). (2)\nSome important remarks on decomposition (1) can be done at this point. It must be stressed that it is a temporal decomposition and not a spatial decomposition as classically formulated through spatial filtering and/or decimation operators in large-eddies simulation (LES) techniques [42]. However, for turbulent flows, time and spatial scales are intricately related. As a matter of fact, in the inertial range, the turn-over time ratio for two different scales L and \u2113 reads \u03c4L/\u03c4\u2113 \u221d (L/\u2113)\n2/3 and provides a direct relation between time-scale coarsening and spatial-scale dilation. Unless specifically indicated, in the following, the resolved (unresolved) components will always be referred to as large-scales (smallscales), respectively, without differentiating between time or space scales. It can be noted that temporal filtering has already been used for the definition of oceanic models [22] or large-eddies simulation approaches [32].\nIn a way similar to the classical derivation of Navier-Stokes equations, the LU setting is based on a stochastic representation of the Reynolds transport theorem (SRTT) [31], describing the rate of change of a random scalar q within a volume V (t) transported by the stochastic flow (1). For incompressible unresolved flows, (i.e. \u2207 \u00b7 \u03c3 = 0), the SRTT reads\nd (\u222b\nV (t) q(x, t) dx\n) =\n\u222b\nV (t)\n( Dtq + q\u2207 \u00b7 (u\u2212 us)dt ) dx, (3a)\nDtq = dtq + (u\u2212 us) \u00b7\u2207q dt+ \u03c3dWt \u00b7\u2207q \u2212 1\n2 \u2207 \u00b7 (a\u2207q) dt, (3b)\nwhere dtq(x, t) = q(x, t + dt) \u2212 q(x, t) stands for the forward time-increment of q at a fixed point x, Dt is introduced as the stochastic transport operator in [31, 37] and plays the role of the material derivative. This operator is derived from the It\u00f4-Wentzell formula [25] to express the differentiation of a stochastic process transported by the flow [31]. Recall that u is the large-scale velocity used in (1) and a is defined in (2). Note also that we omit to mention the dependance of \u03c3 on time. The drift us = 1 2\u2207 \u00b7 a, coined as the It\u00f4-Stokes drift (ISD) in [1], represents through the divergence of the variance tensor, the effects of the small-scale inhomogeneity on the large-scale flow component. This term can be understood as a generalization of the Stokes drift associated to the surface waves velocities. Note that such a term is added as a corrective advective term together with its associated vortex force in large scale simulation of ocean dynamics to take into account the effect of surface waves and Langmuir turbulence [12, 21, 30]. As shown in [1], the LU modelling carries such effects in its own, and generalizes statistical effect of the small-scale inhomogeneity.\nCompared to the deterministic material derivative, the stochastic transport operator in (3b), involves meaningful terms for large-scale representation of fluid flows. The last term is an inhomogeneous diffusion driven by the variance tensor principal directions. It represents the mixing effect of the smallscale component. Although it can be seen as a matrix generalization of the Boussinesq eddy viscosity assumption, its shape is directly imposed by the noise form. The third right-hand side term corresponds to an energy backscattering from the unresolved scales to the large scales. The backscattering term corresponds to an energy source that is exactly compensated by the diffusion term [37].\nIn particular, for an isochoric flow with \u2207 \u00b7 (u \u2212 us) = 0, one may immediately deduce from (3a) the following transport equation of an extensive scalar:\nDtq = 0, (4)\nwhere the energy of such random scalar q can be shown to be globally conserved, through a direct application of It\u00f4 formula [37]:\nd (\u222b\nS\n1 2 q2 dx ) = ( 1 2\n\u222b\nS\nq\u2207 \u00b7 (a\u2207q) dx\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 Energy loss by diffusion\n+ 1\n2\n\u222b\nS\n(\u2207q)Ta\u2207q dx\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 Energy intake by noise\n) dt = 0. (5)\nIndeed, this can be interpreted as a process where the energy brought by the noise is exactly counterbalanced by the energy lost by the diffusion term.\nAs already mentioned, decomposition (1) is written in terms of a It\u00f4 stochastic integral. This decomposition could have been written in the form of a Stratonovich integral as well. The calculus associated to this latter integral has the advantage to follow the classical chain rule. However, the Stratonovich noise is not anymore of zero expectation. This leads thus to a problematic decomposition with velocity fluctuations of non null ensemble mean. For smooth enough integrands, it is possible to safely move from one form to the other. For interested readers, more insights on the difference of the two settings and their implications in stochastic oceanic modelling are provided in [1]."

The initial condition is denoted by u(0, x) = u0(x) for all x \u2208 S. As usual, u(t, x) =( u1(t, x), ..., ud(t, x) ) and p(t, x) stands for the velocity and the pressure of the fluid, respectively. The term dp\u03c3t corresponds to the Brownian (martingale) part of the pressure. The Ito-Stokes drift us is defined as us := 1\n2 \u2207 \u00b7 a and \u03c1 stands for the fluid density. The dimensioning constant Re = UL/\u03bd\ndenotes the Reynolds number, sets from the ratio of the product of characteristic length and velocity scales, UL, with the kinematics viscosity \u03bd. As for the noise scaling parameter, \u01eb, it encodes the amplitude scale of the unresolved energy and should converge to zero when all the flow component are resolved. Meaning thus there is no noise and the system corresponds trivially to the deterministic Navier-Stokes system. In [38] this factor is defined as the ratio between the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and the mean kinetic energy (MKE), multiplied by the ratio between the unresolved scale correlation time T\u03c3 and the large-scale advection time. This quantity tends to zero when all the scales are resolved.\nAlthough the system corresponds to the Navier-Stokes for zero noise, the convergence toward weak (strong) solutions of the 3D (2D) deterministic Navier-Stokes, respectively, at the limit of vanishing noise is an important property that should be ideally respected by any stochastic flow representations to ensure physical relevance when all the scales are resolved without almost any uncertainty. This is the main results we aim to prove in this paper.\nFirst of all, in order to work with a pressure-free system through a divergence-free Leray projection, we proceed to the change of variable v := u \u2212 \u03b52us in (6) to rewrite the system with a classical incompressibility condition on v:\ndtv+ v\u00b7\u2207v dt\u2212 1\nRe \u2206v dt+ \u03b52(v\u00b7\u2207)us dt\u2212\n\u03b52\n2 \u2207\u00b7(a\u2207v) dt\u2212\n\u03b54\n2 \u2207\u00b7(a\u2207us) dt\u2212\n\u03b52 Re \u2206us dt+\u03b5 2\u2202tusdt\n= \u2212 1\n\u03c1 \u2207(p dt + dp\u03c3t ) \u2212 (\u03b5\u03c3dWt \u00b7\u2207)v \u2212 (\u03b5\n3\u03c3dWt \u00b7\u2207)us + \u03b5\nRe \u2206(\u03c3 dWt), (8)\nwith the incompressibility conditions\n\u2207 \u00b7 v = 0 \u2207 \u00b7 \u03c3 = 0 , (9)\nfor all points in S together with Dirichlet boundary conditions v(t, x) = 0, \u03c3\u0302(x, y, t) = 0 for all x \u2208 \u2202S, y \u2208 S and t > 0 and the initial condition v(0, x) = v0(x) := u0(x) \u2212 \u03b5\n2us(0, x) for all x \u2208 S.

            "text": "Several kinds of solutions can be defined for stochastic partial differential equations. As for deterministic PDEs, these can be strong, weak or mild (semi-group) solutions. The solutions are said to be strong in the probabilistic sense when they are constructed for a fixed Wiener process W on a given stochastic basis (\u2126,F , (Ft)t\u2208[0,T ],P), composed of filtration (Ft)t\u2208[0,T ] and probability space (\u2126,F ,P). For stochastic evolution models like the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations in dimension 3, it is more natural to work with weaker solutions, called martingale solutions. In this case, we look for solutions defined as a triplet composed of a stochastic basis, a Wiener process and an adapted process.\nMore precisely, we say that there is a martingale solution of system (11) if there exists a stochastic basis (\u2126,F , (Ft)t\u2208[0,T ],P), a cylindrical Wiener process W on L\n2(S,Rd) and a progressively measurable process v : [0, T ]\u00d7 \u2126 \u2192 H, with\nv\u03b5 \u2208 L 2 (\u2126\u00d7 [0, T ];V ) \u2229 L2 (\u2126 , L\u221e([0, T ];H)) ,\nsuch that P\u2212 a.e, v\u03b5 satisfies for all time t \u2208 [0, T ]\nv\u03b5(t) +\n\u222b t\n0 Av\u03b5(s) ds +\n\u222b t\n0 B ( v\u03b5(s) ) ds +\n\u222b t\n0 F\u03b5 ( v\u03b5(s) ) ds = v0 +\n\u222b t\n0 G ( v\u03b5(s) ) dWs, (12)\nwhere the equality must be understood in the weak sense. Martingale solution are hence the equivalent, in the stochastic setting, of Leray-Hopf weak solution with an additional degree of freedom provided by a complying Wiener process. In this work, we will show, for all \u03b5 > 0, the existence in dimension 2 or 3 of a martingale solution for the LU representation of the Navier-Stokes equations for noises associated with a smooth enough diffusion tensor kernel \u03c3\u0302 in space and time. In dimension 2, this solution is unique and strong in the probabilistic sense. This result is summarized in the following theorem.\nTheorem 3.1 Let d = 2 or 3 and assume that the noise is smooth enough in the sense that its variance tensor and Ito-Stokes drift are such that\nsup t\u2208[0,T ] \u2016\u03c3(t)\u20162 L2(L 2(S,Rd),H3(S)) = sup t\u2208[0,T ]\n\u221e\u2211\nk=0\n\u2016\u03c6k(t)\u2016 2 H3(S) <\u221e, (13)\nus \u2208 L \u221e ( 0, T ;H3(S,Rd) ) ; \u2202tus \u2208 L \u221e(0, T ;H) and a\u2207us \u2208 L \u221e(0, T ;V ). (14)\nThen, for all \u03b5 > 0, equation (12) admits a martingale solution v\u03b5. Moreover, for d = 2, any solution of (12) is strong in the probabilistic sense, belongs to L2(\u2126, C([0, T ];H)) and is unique.\nBesides, when \u03b5\u2192 0, for d = 3, any converging subsequence of (v\u03b5)\u03b5>0 converges in law to a solution of the deterministic Navier-Stokes equation in L2([0, T ] ; H) \u2229 C0([0, T ] ; D(A\u22123/2) ) and there exists such subsequences. For d = 2, the whole sequence converges to the unique solution of the Navier-Stokes equation in L2(\u2126, L\u221e([0, T ];H) \u2229 L2([0, T ];V )).\nRemark 3.1 When d = 3, although the limit equation is deterministic, the limit solution of the NavierStokes equations is a random object. This unusual feature is due to the lack of uniqueness for the 3D Navier-Stokes equation. For smooth initial data, it is know that there exists a unique strong solution on a small interval of time [0, T (u0)) and that weak-strong uniqueness holds. As a result, the limit solution obtained in Theorem 3.1 is not random when restricted to [0, T (u0)).\nThe proof, which is thoroughly developed in the following sections, follows the well established approach developed in [15, 17]. It is composed of the following successive steps.\n\u2022 An approximate finite dimensional system obtained from a Galerkin projection is first studied:\n{ dtvn(t) + Avn(t) dt +B n \u03b5 (vn(t)) dt + F n \u03b5 vn(t) dt = G n \u03b5 vn(t) dWt,\nvn(0) = v0.\nThe existence and uniqueness of a solution v\u03b5,n is proved for all integers n.\n\u2022 The sequence (v\u03b5,n)n is shown to verify energy estimates.\n\u2022 These estimates enable us to prove that the laws (L(v\u03b5,n))n are weakly compact (tight) on an appropriate space.\n\u2022 We then apply the Skorohod\u2019s embedding theorem and change the stochastic basis. On this basis\nthere exists (v\u03b5,n)n such that v\u03b5,n L = v\u03b5,n and by thinning, the sequence (v\u03b5,n)n converges on an appropriate space almost surely to v\u03b5, a martingale solution.\n\u2022 Finally, in 2D we prove pathwise uniqueness and use a Lemma due to Gyongy and Krylov to deduce that the sequence (v\u03b5,n)n converges in probability to a strong solution.\n\u2022 Having built a family (v\u03b5)\u03b5>0 of solutions of (12), we prove then that this family converges to a - possibly random for d = 3 - solution of the deterministic Navier-Stokes equation when \u03b5\u2192 0.\nThe condition of Theorem 3.1 simplifies when the covariance operator does not depend on time or if the ISD is divergent free. In both cases the condition on the temporal derivative of the ISD are not necessary. We note also, that for a spatially homogeneous noise, the variance tensor is constant and the ISD cancels. However this requires additionally either a periodic domain or the full space.\nThe assumptions on the noise are anyway non optimal but it is not the purpose of this paper to consider non spatially smooth noise since in practice it is smooth. Note that condition (13) is satisfied for instance if we choose \u03c3 independent on t and equal to A\u2212r with r large enough where A is the Stokes operator defined in the following section. Indeed, in this case \u03c6k = \u03bb \u2212r k ek where (ek)k is an orthonormal complete system of eigenvectors of A associated to the eigenvalues (\u03bbk)k and \u2016\u03c6k(t)\u2016 2 H3(S) = \u03bb3\u22122rk . The behavior of the eigenvalues: \u03bbk \u223c k 2/d allows to conclude that (13) follows. Since us = 1 2\u2207 \u00b7 a and\na is defined by (2), (14) holds also for r large enough since \u2016us\u2016H3(S) \u2264 \u2211\u221e\nk=0 \u2016\u03c6k(t)\u2016 2 H4(S) . Finally,\nsince A\u2212r is self-adjoint and Hilbert-Schmidt for r > d/4, it is associated to a symmetric kernel \u03c3\u0302 which is bounded for r large enough.\nThe convergence of the LU representation for limiting vanishing noise warrants that the LU NavierStokes equations can be interpreted as a large-scale model of the deterministic Navier-Stokes equation.\nThese convergence results open new interesting possibilities for the study of turbulence or for the proposition of new large-scale representations of fluid dynamics. From the theoretical point of view, it might be interesting to explore multiscale versions of the LU representation based on spatial filtering together with nested noise models. This would generalize classical large eddy models in which the noise would depend on the spatial filtering applied. The coarser the filtering the larger the noise. Energy transfer between scales would then be very interesting to study in this probabilistic setting. Stochastic Kolmogorov-Monin-Horwart equations for energy exchanges across scale could be obtained by this way. From a practical point of view, these convergence results justify the setting of such stochastic models to represent large-scale solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. Compared to the over-diffusive schemes usually employed to that end, these stochastic representations have the advantage to be well suited to uncertainty quantification, ensemble forecasting and data-assimilation [1, 2, 16, 36, 41, 47], as well as for large-scale flow modelling as used in [34] for the characterization of the velocity profile in turbulent boundary layer flows."

For all v \u2208 D(A) and w \u2208 V , we have\n(Av , w)H = 1\nRe ((v , w))V , (16)\nsince P is a orthogonal projection onto H. Let a be the continuous bilinear form defined by a(v,w) := 1 Re \u222b S \u2207v \u00b7\u2207w dx for all v and w \u2208 V . For all v \u2208 V , we have Av = a(v , \u00b7), in particular, Av \u2208 V \u2032 and\n|Av| V \u2032\n\u2264 1\nRe \u2016v\u2016 V . (17)\nWe also have the equality for all v and w \u2208 V ,\n\u3008Av , w \u3009V \u2032\u00d7V = 1\nRe ((v , w)) V . (18)\nThe operator A : D(A) \u2282 H \u2192 H is positive self-adjoint with compact resolvent, since the embedding V \u2192\u0592 H is compact. By the spectral theorem, we denote by (\u03bbi)i\u22650 the increasing (and unbounded) eigenvalues of A and by (ei)i\u22650 a corresponding orthonormal Hilbertian basis in H of eigenvectors of A. This basis enables to define new spaces\nD(A\u03b1) := {v \u2208 H :\n\u221e\u2211\nk=0\n\u03bb2\u03b1k |(u , ek)H | 2 <\u221e}\nfor all \u03b1 > 0. We endow D(A\u03b1) with the Hilbertian norm\n\u2016v\u2016 D(A\u03b1) :=\n( \u221e\u2211\nk=0\n\u03bb2\u03b1k |(v , ek)H | 2\n)1/2 .\nAll eigenvectors ei belong to D(A \u03b1) for any \u03b1. By (18), it can be observed that V = D(A1/2) and \u2016v\u2016V = 1 Re \u2016v\u2016D(A1/2) for all v \u2208 V . Moreover, since the domain S is smooth, it can be proved that the norm of the classical Sobolev space H2\u03b1(S,Rd) is equivalent to \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016D(A\u03b1) .\nWe have the Gelfand triple D(A\u03b1) \u2282 H \u2282 D(A\u2212\u03b1) relative to H. We denote by \u3008\u00b7 , \u00b7\u3009D(A\u2212\u03b1)\u00d7D(A\u03b1) the duality product. We have, for all u \u2208 H and v \u2208 D(A\u03b1),\n\u3008u , v\u3009D(A\u2212\u03b1)\u00d7D(A\u03b1) = (u , v)H .\nAlthough incorrect from a strict point of view, we may use the notation (u, v)H for u \u2208 D(A \u2212\u03b1), v \u2208 D(A\u03b1).\nLet b be the trilinear form defined for all u, v and w \u2208 V by\nb(u, v, w) = ( w , (u \u00b7\u2207)v ) H =\n\u222b\nS\nw(x) (u(x) \u00b7\u2207) v(x) dx.\nBy Cauchy-Schwarz, and H\u00f6lder inequality, b satisfies for all u, v and w \u2208 V\n|b(u, v, w)| \u2264 \u2016u\u2016 L4(S,Rd) \u2016w\u2016 L4(S,Rd) \u2016v\u2016 V .\nWhen the dimension d = 2, Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality and Poincar\u00e9 inequality give for v \u2208 V ,\n\u2016v\u2016 L4(S,Rd) \u2264 C|v|1/2 H \u2016v\u20161/2 V \u2264 C\u2016v\u2016 V .\nFor d = 3, we have similarly for v \u2208 V ,\n\u2016v\u2016 L4(S,Rd) \u2264 C|v|1/4 H \u2016v\u20163/4 V \u2264 C\u2016v\u2016 V .\nTo conclude, for d = 2 or 3, we obtain for all u, v and w \u2208 V\n|b(u, v, w)| \u2264 C \u2016u\u2016 V \u2016v\u2016 V \u2016w\u2016 V , (19)\nin particular b is continuous on V \u00d7 V \u00d7 V .\nSince the Leray projection P is self-adjoint in L2(S,Rd), we have\nb(u, v, w) =\n\u222b\nS\nP (u \u00b7\u2207v)w dx. (20)\nLet B be the bilinear map defined by B(u, v) := b(u, v, \u00b7) for all u and v \u2208 V . For the sake of conciseness we write B(u) := B(u, u). Equation (20) provides an explicit expression of B(v) as:\nB(v) = P (v \u00b7\u2207v). (21)\nBy (19), we have for all u and v \u2208 V that B(u, v) \u2208 V \u2032 and\n|B(u, v)|V \u2032 \u2264 C \u2016u\u2016V \u2016v\u2016V . (22)\nThe bilinear mapping B : V \u00d7 V \u2192 V \u2032 is hence continuous.\nLet R > 0, for all u and v \u2208 BV (0, R), with BV (0, R) denoting the zero-centered ball of radius R in V , we have\n|B(u)\u2212B(v)|V \u2032 = |B(u, u\u2212 v)\u2212B(u\u2212 v, v)|V \u2032\n\u2264 C (\u2016u\u2016 V \u2016u\u2212 v\u2016 V + \u2016u\u2212 v\u2016 V \u2016v\u2016 V ) \u2264 2C R \u2016u\u2212 v\u2016 V .\nThis shows that B : V \u00d7 V \u2192 V \u2032 is locally Lipschitz.\nAs the function of V are divergence free, for all u, v and w \u2208 V we have\nb(u, v, w) = \u2212b(u,w, v) and b(u, v, v) = 0. (23)\nConsequently, B : V \u00d7 V \u2192 V \u2032 satisfies for all u, v and w \u2208 V :\n\u3008B(u, v) , v\u3009 V \u2032\u00d7V = 0, (24)\n\u3008B(u, v) , w\u3009 V \u2032\u00d7V = \u2212\u3008B(u,w) , v\u3009 V \u2032\u00d7V .\nThe operator B can be extended to H\u00d7H. Indeed by the Sobolev embedding H\u03b2(S,Rd) \u2192\u0592 L\u221e(S,Rd) when \u03b2 > d/2, the embedding D(A\u03b2/2) \u2192\u0592 L\u221e(S,Rd) is continuous. We have hence for all u, v \u2208 V and w \u2208 D ( A \u03b2+1 2 ) ,\n|b(u, v, w)| = |b(u,w, v)| \u2264 \u2016\u2207w\u2016L\u221e(S) |u|H |v|H\n\u2264 C \u2016\u2207w\u2016 D(A\u03b2/2) |u| H |v| H\n\u2264 C \u2016w\u2016 D ( A \u03b2+1 2 ) |u| H |v| H .\nLet \u03b3 := \u03b2+12 > d+2 4 . The tri-linear form b can be extended as a tri-linear operator b : H\u00d7H\u00d7D(A \u03b3) \u2192 R. In particular, B can be uniquely extended to an operator still denoted B : H\u00d7H \u2192 D(A\u2212\u03b3) which verifies for all u and v \u2208 H\n\u2016B(u, v)\u2016D(A\u2212\u03b3 ) \u2264 C |u|H |v|H . (25)\nAs V \u2282 H, we have also for all u \u2208 H and v \u2208 V that\n\u2016B(u, v)\u2016D(A\u2212\u03b3 ) \u2264 C |u|H \u2016v\u2016V . (26)\nTo study the other terms in equation (12), some assumptions on a, us and \u03c3 need to be introduced. As already mentioned, since \u03c3 is Hilbert-Schmidt, it is compact and there exists (\u03c6k(t))k an orthogonal basis consisting of the eigenfunctions of the covariance operator for each t \u2208 R. Also there exists a set {(\u03b2kt )t\u22650 , k \u2208 N} of independent and identically distributed standard Brownian motions such that the noise term can be decomposed on this basis as\n\u03c3(t) dWt =\n\u221e\u2211\nk=0\n\u03c6k(t) d\u03b2 k t and a(x, t) =\n\u221e\u2211\nk=0\n\u03c6k(x, t)\u03c6 T k (x, t), (27)\nwhere each eigenfunction is weighted by its corresponding eigenvalue. It can be noticed that as the noise is divergence free, we have P\u03c6k = \u03c6k for all k. Recall that the assumption on the smoothness of the noise is:\nsup t\u2208[0,T ]\n\u221e\u2211\nk=0\n\u2016\u03c6k(t)\u2016 2\nH3(S) <\u221e,\nus \u2208 L \u221e ( 0, T ;H3(S,Rd) ) , \u2202tus \u2208 L \u221e(0, T ;H), a\u2207us \u2208 L \u221e(0, T ;V ).\n(28)\nBy Sobolev embedding and by definition of a, we deduce\nsup t\u2208[0,T ]\n\u221e\u2211\nk=0\n\u2016\u03c6k(t)\u2016 2\nL\u221e(S,Rd) <\u221e , sup t\u2208[0,T ] \u2016a(t)\u2016V + \u2016a(t)\u2016 L\u221e(S,Rd) <\u221e . (29)\nAlso, it can be seen that this implies:\nsup t\u2208[0,T ]\n\u221e\u2211\nk=0\n\u2223\u2223B ( \u03c6k(t), us(t) )\u2223\u22232 H <\u221e , sup\nt\u2208[0,T ] \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 a(t)\u2016 L\u221e(S,Rd) <\u221e (30)\nLet us now consider the drift terms in (10), corresponding to F\u01eb in the abstract problem (11). In the following for sake of conciseness, we drop the \u01eb subscript:\nF (v) = \u03b52B(v, us) \u2212 \u03b52 2 P ( \u2207 \u00b7 (a\u2207v) ) \u2212 \u03b54 2 P ( \u2207 \u00b7 (a\u2207us) ) \u2212 \u03b52Aus + \u03b5 2P\u2202tus. (31)\nBy (17), (22), (28) and (29), we have for v \u2208 V :\n\u2016F (v)\u2016 V \u2032 \u2264 C\u03b52 \u2016us\u2016V \u2016v\u2016V + \u03b5 2\u2016a\u2016L\u221e(S)\u2016v\u2016V + \u03b5 4\u2016a\u2016L\u221e(S)\u2016us\u2016V + \u03b52\nRe \u2016us\u2016V + \u03b5\n2\u2016\u2202tus\u2016V \u2032 (32)\n\u2264 C\u03b52 (\u2016v\u2016 V + 1), (33)\nand, for all u and v \u2208 V , \u2016F (u)\u2212 F (v)\u2016\nV \u2032 \u2264 C\u03b52 \u2016u\u2212 v\u2016V . (34)\nWe may also extend continuously F to H. Note that for v \u2208 H, w \u2208 D(A): ( P (\u2207 \u00b7 ( a\u2207v) ) , w )\nH\n= ( \u2207 \u00b7 (a\u2207v), w ) H = ( v , \u2207 \u00b7 (a\u2207w) ) H \u2264 C|v|H\u2016w\u2016D(A),\nso that \u2016P (\u2207 \u00b7 (a\u2207v))\u2016D(A\u22121) \u2264 C|v|H .\nMoreover |B(v, us)|H \u2264 C\u2016\u2207us\u2016L\u221e(S) |v|H \u2264 C|v|H .\nIt follows:\n\u2016F (v)\u2016D(A\u22121) \u2264 C\u03b5 2 |v|H + C\u03b5 2, \u2016F (v) \u2212 F (w)\u2016D(A\u22121) \u2264 C\u03b5 2 |v \u2212 w|H . (35)\nLet us now examine the martingale term. Let G be defined for all v \u2208 V by\nG(v) dWt = P\n( \u03b5\nRe \u2206(\u03c3 dWt) \u2212 (\u03b5\u03c3dWt \u00b7\u2207)v \u2212 (\u03b5\n3\u03c3dWt \u00b7\u2207)us\n)\n= \u221e\u2211\nk=0\n( \u03b5\nRe P (\u2206\u03c6k) \u2212 \u03b5P ((\u03c6k \u00b7\u2207)v) \u2212 \u03b5\n3P ((\u03c6k \u00b7\u2207)us) ) d\u03b2kt\n= \u221e\u2211\nk=0\n( \u2212\u03b5A\u03c6k \u2212 \u03b5B(\u03c6k, v) \u2212 \u03b5 3B(\u03c6k, us) ) d\u03b2kt .\nIn other words, G : V \u2192 L(L2(S,Rd),H) is defined for v \u2208 V and \u03d5 \u2208 L2(S,Rd)\nG(v)\u03d5 = \u2212\u03b5A\u03c3\u03d5 \u2212 \u03b5B(\u03c3\u03d5, v) \u2212 \u03b53B(\u03c3\u03d5, us) .\nThanks to (28), we see that for v \u2208 V , G(v) \u2208 L2(L 2(S,Rd),H) and\n|G(v)|2 L2(L2(S,Rd),H) =\n\u221e\u2211\nk=0\n|G(v)\u03c6k | 2 H \u2264 C\n\u221e\u2211\nk=0\n( \u03b52 |A\u03c6k| 2 H + \u03b52\u2016\u03c6k\u2016 2 L\u221e(S) \u2016v\u20162 V + \u03b56\u2016\u2207us\u2016 2 L\u221e(\u2126) |\u03c6k| 2 H )\n\u2264 C\u03b52(\u2016v\u20162 V + 1+\u03b54). (36)\nMoreover, for u and v \u2208 V ,\n\u2016G(u) \u2212G(v)\u20162 L2(L2(S,Rd),H) \u2264 C\u03b52\u2016u\u2212 v\u20162 V ,\nand G : V \u2192 L2(L 2(S,Rd),H) is Lipschitz continuous.\nThe mapping G also extends by continuity to G : H \u2192 L2(L 2(S,Rd), V \u2032) which verifies for all\nv, w \u2208 H,\n|G(v)|2 L2(L2(S,Rd),V \u2032) \u2264 C\u03b52( |v|2 H + 1 ), |G(v) \u2212G(w)|2 L2(L2(S,Rd),V \u2032) \u2264 C\u03b52 |v \u2212 w|2 H . (37)\nOur construction of solutions is based on Galerkin approximation. We use the Hilbertian basis (ei)i\u22650 of H consisting of eigenvectors of A, and define, for n \u2208 N, the orthogonal projections Pn : D(A\u2212\u03b3) \u2192 Hn := Span(e0, ... , en):\nPnu :=\nn\u2211\ni=0\n\u3008u , ei\u3009D(A\u2212\u03b3)\u00d7D(A\u03b3)ei, u \u2208 D(A \u2212\u03b3), \u03b3 \u2208 R.\nClearly: \u2016Pnu\u2016D(A\u2212\u03b3 ) \u2264 \u2016u\u2016D(A\u2212\u03b3 ), u \u2208 D(A \u2212\u03b3) . (38)\nBy dominated convergence, we have:\n\u2016Pnv \u2212 v\u2016D(A\u03b3 ) \u2212\u2192 n\u2192+\u221e\n0, v \u2208 D(A\u03b3), \u03b3 \u2208 R. (39)\nAlso for \u03b1 < \u03b2 and all n \u2208 N,\n\u2016Pnv\u2016D(A\u03b2) \u2264 \u03bb \u03b2\u2212\u03b1 n+1 \u2016Pnv\u2016D(A\u03b1), \u2016 (I \u2212 Pn) v\u2016D(A\u03b1) \u2264 \u03bb \u03b1\u2212\u03b2 n+1 \u2016 (I \u2212 Pn) v\u2016D(A\u03b2 ) . (40)\nWe now introduce the projected operators:\nBn := PnB F n = PnF G n = PnG .\nIt can be seen that Bn is locally Lipschitz and Fn and Gn are globally Lipschitz on Hn, thus\n{ dtvn(t) + Avn(t) dt +B n ( vn(t) ) dt + Fn ( vn(t) ) dt = Gn ( vn(t) ) dWt,\nvn(0) = Pn(v0), (41)\nadmits also a local solution vn \u2208 C 0([0, tn] , Hn). Note that tn is a priori random, it can be chosen as a stopping time. We prove in section 4.2 that for all n \u2208 N, vn verifies for all p \u2265 2:\nE [ sup\n0\u2264s\u2264tn\n|vn(s)| p H\n] < C, E [ \u222b tn\n0 \u2016vn(s)\u2016\n2 V ds\n] < C . (42)\nThese energy estimates enable us to deduce by standard arguments that the solutions vn are global in time, in particular vn \u2208 C 0([0, T ] , Hn), tn = T and for all t \u2208 [0, T ], we have,\nvn(t)\u2212 Pn(v0) +\n\u222b t\n0\n[ Avn(s) +B n ( vn(s) ) + Fn ( vn(s) ) ] ds =\n\u222b t\n0 Gn ( vn(s) ) dWs .

This proves uniqueness.\nUsing an argument due to Gyongy and Krylov (see for instance [15], section 5), we conclude that the whole sequence (vn)n converges to a unique solution of (67) in probability in the original stochastic basis. This in particular gives the existence of a probabilistic strong solution in the 2D case."
