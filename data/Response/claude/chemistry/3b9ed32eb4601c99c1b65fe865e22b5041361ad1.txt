 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Isolate and characterize the new alkaloids identified in M. speciosa leaves, especially the ones abundant in young leaves like vomicine, hirsuteine, and alstonine, using NMR spectroscopy. Evaluate their bioactivities related to anti-diabetic, neuroprotective, antimutagenic, and antipsychotic effects. 

2. Elucidate the full biosynthetic pathway of mitragynine and other major alkaloids in M. speciosa by identifying the missing steps and enzymes involved. Characterize the expression of biosynthetic genes in young versus mature leaves. 

3. Investigate the effects of environmental factors (light, temperature, humidity, etc.) and genetics on alkaloid composition and abundance in young and mature M. speciosa leaves. This can help optimize alkaloid yields.

4. Study the protein targets and mechanisms of action of abundant alkaloids in young M. speciosa leaves, like vomicine and hirsuteine, related to their anti-diabetic and neuroprotective activities.

5. Evaluate the medicinal effects of extracts from young versus mature M. speciosa leaves in animal models of diabetes, cancer, depression, pain, etc. This can determine the optimal leaf maturity for therapeutic efficacy.
