 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Develop and validate an automated algorithm to interpret the plantar pressure graphs from smart insoles, removing the need for manual analysis. This could allow for real-time and continuous assessment of lower extremity function.

2. Conduct larger studies with more diverse patient populations, such as those with specific medical conditions or functional impairments, to further validate the use of smart insoles for SPPB assessment. 

3. Investigate the feasibility and validity of using smart insoles for remote, unsupervised SPPB testing, enabling more frequent and convenient monitoring.

4. Explore the responsiveness and minimal detectable change of the SPPB conducted via smart insoles to determine their ability to detect meaningful changes over time.

5. Examine the potential of using smart insole data beyond the SPPB, for more comprehensive evaluation of factors like gait, balance, fall risk, and effects of interventions in older adults.
