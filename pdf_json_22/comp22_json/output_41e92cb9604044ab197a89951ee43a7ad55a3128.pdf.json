    "abstractText": "To assess and meta-analyse the pooled dropout rate from the randomised control trilas that use virtual reality for balance or gait rehabilitation in people with multiple sclerosis. A systematic review of randomised control trials with meta-analysis and meta-regressions was performed. A search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database, the Cochrane Database, CINHAL, LILACS, ScienceDirect, and ProQuest. It was last updated in July 2022. After the selection of studies, a quality appraisal was carried out using the PEDro Scale and the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials. A descriptive analysis of main characteristics and dropout information was performed. An overall proportion meta-analysis calculated the pooled dropout rate. Odds ratio meta-analysis compared the dropout likelihood between interventions. The meta-regression evaluated the influence of moderators related to dropout. Sixteen studies with 656 participants were included. The overall pooled dropout rate was 6.6% and 5.7% for virtual reality and 9.7% in control groups. The odds ratio (0.89, p = 0.46) indicated no differences in the probability of dropouts between the interventions. The number, duration, frequency, and weeks of sessions, intervention, sex, multiple sclerosis phenotype, Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and PEDro score were not moderators (p > 0.05). Adverse events were not reported and could not be analysed as moderators. Dropouts across the virtual reality and control comparators were similar without significant differences. Nonetheless, there is a slight trend that could favour virtual reality. Standardisation in reporting dropouts and adverse events is recommended for future trials.

In this way, virtual reality-based interventions have been enhanced as a technological solution for telerehabilitation at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic (MatamalaGomez et\u00a0al. 2021). Furthermore, the previous literature has proposed that virtual reality strategies present higher adherence in patients with neurological disorders (Asadzadeh et\u00a0al. 2021; Dalmazane et\u00a0al. 2021). Multitask training,\n* Cristina Garc\u00eda-Mu\u00f1oz cristina.garciamunoz@uca.es\n1 Department of\u00a0Physiotherapy, University of\u00a0Seville, Seville, Spain\n2 Department of\u00a0Nursing and\u00a0Physiotherapy, University of\u00a0Cadiz, Cadiz, Spain\n3 Department of\u00a0Physiotherapy, University of\u00a0Malaga, Malaga, Spain\n4 Institute of\u00a0Research and\u00a0Innovation in\u00a0Biomedical Sciences of\u00a0the\u00a0Province of\u00a0Cadiz (INiBICA), University of\u00a0Cadiz, Cadiz, Spain\n5 UMSS Research Group, Universidad of\u00a0Seville, Seville, Spain\n1 3\npatient motivation, safety, and the low cost of commercial devices are some of the benefits of using virtual reality for neurological rehabilitation (Forsberg et\u00a0al. 2015; Gustavsson et\u00a0al. 2021; Moan et\u00a0al. 2021). Nonetheless, some undesired effects (e.g. headache, sickness, or nausea) (Massetti et\u00a0al. 2018), as well as the difficulty of transferring the complex skills trained in virtual environments to the real world and the lack of ecological validity in a neurologically impaired population (Levac et\u00a0al. 2019), were reported. Specifically, for balance training, the time of latency, the underestimation of perceived distances, and the dependence on specific systems (e.g. balance board) and virtual contexts were proposed as potential weaknesses of virtual reality environments (Morel et\u00a0al. 2015).\nMultiple sclerosis is a global neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately three million people in the world (Tafti et\u00a0al. 2022). Balance disorders, gait impairments, and fatigue are the main symptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis that obtain positive effects with physical therapy intervention (Amedoro et\u00a0al. 2020; Abou et\u00a0al. 2022). Particularly, virtual reality-based physical rehabilitation showed benefits for balance and gait training (Casuso-Holgado et\u00a0al. 2018; Nascimento et\u00a0al. 2021); however, fatigue is a significant barrier to participation in physical activity, which influences the participants\u2019 adherence (Moore et\u00a0al. 2022). A recent systematic review has summarised dropout data from randomised control clinical trials about exercise interventions in people with multiple sclerosis, concluding that mean age, the proportion of females, and intervention duration were moderators inversely associated with adherence (Dennett et\u00a0al. 2020). Therefore, these findings could impact the sample size calculation, promoting an under- or overestimation. Furthermore, this could influence the differential dropout rate, which is how the degree of dropout differs between the intervention and comparator conditions after randomisation (Crutzen et\u00a0al. 2015). It might affect the power of research and could present a risk of bias for randomised control clinical trials (Cooper et\u00a0al. 2018). In view of this background, setting accurate expected dropout rates in virtual reality studies for rehabilitation in multiple sclerosis could help future trials to avoid problems in their internal or external validity. In addition, the identification of factors specifically associated with dropout in virtual reality trials could help clinicians when translating research into practice.\nAs far as we are concerned, no previous systematic reviews were found reporting dropout in virtual reality interventions for balance and gait rehabilitation in this population. Thus, the present systematic review and metaanalysis aimed to: (1) systematically assess and metaanalyse the overall pooled dropout rate of randomised controlled trials using virtual reality as an intervention for balance or gait training in people with multiple sclerosis in both absolute and comparative terms; (2) analyse\nwhether any participant or intervention factors are related to dropout; and (3) identify adverse events that could be the reason for dropouts."

Walking ability was preserved according to the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score (EDSS \u2264 6). Included interventions involved any type of virtual reality systems aimed at improving balance or gait compared to other interventions based on physical activity with or without external aid use. Furthermore, studies that reported dropout event information were included.\n1 3"

            "text": "First, two independent reviewers (C.G.-M. and M.J.C.-H.) identified potential articles in databases to be included in the systematic review through the title and abstract information. Next, duplicates were removed, and an exhaustive analysis of articles was carried out based on their full-text reading. This step was particularly focussed on the selection criteria assessment, ensuring that the inclusion criteria were met before selecting suitable studies. In the case of disagreement, a third reviewer (M.-D.C.-V.) was consulted to decide on the inclusion of the documents.\nOnce articles were selected, the quality assessment was conducted using the PEDro scale (Maher et\u00a0al. 2003) and the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials (RoB-2) (Higgins et\u00a0al. 2019). PEDro is a reliable tool of 11 items that evaluates the inner validity of a clinical trial. If studies score above 6 points, they are classified as level I evidence (6\u20138: good; 8\u201310: excellent). If the score is below 5, they are classified as level II (4\u20135: deficient; < 4: poor). ROB-2 allows the evaluation of bias in randomised control trials, comprising five domains (bias arising from the randomisation process, due to deviations from the intended interventions, to missing outcome data, in the measurement of the outcome, and in the selection of the reported result) that are qualified as a low or high risk of bias with some concerns (Sterne et\u00a0al. 2019).\nNext, reviewers recorded the data for qualitative and quantitative synthesis. The extracted data were country, multiple sclerosis phenotype and disability status, female and male percentages, age, experimental and comparator group intervention characteristics, number of participants recruited and analysed, retention rate, dropout rates (for the experimental and control groups), reasons for dropout (in each group), and adverse events. Disagreements in data were solved by consensus with a third reviewer. Information provided by the included studies allowed us to calculate dropout rates in all cases, so no corresponding authors were contacted."

            "text": "Dropout rate was calculated as the number of participants who did not complete the intervention and follow-up period divided by the total number of participants that underwent the randomisation process. Moreover, retention rate was the total number of participants that concluded the intervention, showing the adherence rate to treatment. For those studies that included more than two groups of intervention, comparison between groups was analysed separately two by two.\nTo conduct the meta-analysis, the R Studio software (version 4.0.0) and its packages meta, metafor, and dmetar were used (Viechtbauer 2010; Balduzzi et\u00a0al. 2019; Harrer et\u00a0al.\n2021). The proportion meta-analysis was performed through the metaprop function to determine the estimated dropout rate in virtual reality intervention, the control comparator, and all arms. Proportions were transformed using the logit transformation (Schwarzer et\u00a0al. 2019).\nA binary meta-analysis based on odds ratios (ORs) was conducted to examine whether the probability of dropouts is higher in the virtual reality or in the comparator interventions. To assess the effect measure in binary outcomes, the OR with a 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was calculated, and the inverse variance method was used to adjust pooling estimations to sparse data (considering that dropouts are a rare event). Likewise, the Hartung\u2013Knapp adjustment for a random effects model was implemented. Focussing on ORs, if the value is 1, there are no differences in dropouts between the experimental and comparator groups. In contrast, if the OR is greater than 1, a higher dropout rate was registered for the experimental group. The restricted maximum-likelihood estimator for tau2 was selected to estimate the between-study variance (Viechtbauer 2005). As some studies could present zero events in the experimental and/or comparator arm, a 0.5 continuity correction was added to all meta-analyses, as suggested by Gart and Zweifel (1967).\nHeterogeneity between studies was assessed through I2, tau2, and Cochrane\u2019s Q (p < 0.05 indicates heterogeneity). When I2 presents a value above 50%, it means that large heterogeneity is found across studies (Higgins et\u00a0al. 2021). A random effects model was employed considering the possible degree of heterogeneity between the included studies.\nForest plots were used to show the outcomes of proportions and binary meta-analyses. The prediction interval was added as a red line to the forest plot to provide a measure of reliability of future treatment effects in new studies (Nagashima et\u00a0al. 2019). Depending on the level of immersion of the subject within the virtual environment, virtual reality was classified as non-immersive, semi-immersive, and fully immersive for subgroup analysis.\nA sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the influence of studies on the overall binary meta-analysis results. The influence was explored to detect the presence of outlier data and whether there were studies that contributed to heterogeneity or bias pooled results. A Baujat plot, a L\u2019Abb\u00e9 plot, and influence graphs were created to represent influential cases in meta-analysis. The influence graphs showed the studies that significantly influenced the pooled effect size in red. In addition, an exploratory graphical analysis of data was performed to examine whether there is a clear trend of effect size related to independent variables.\nMeta-regression was conducted to evaluate possible associations between participants or study characteristics which could vary in the presence of dropout events. Studies with no available data were excluded from the metaregression analysis. Moreover, to run the meta-regression,\n1 3\nat least three studies with the predictor were needed. The analysed moderators were interventions, number, duration, frequency and weeks of sessions, EDSS score, multiple sclerosis phenotype, and sex.\nPublication bias and small study effects were evaluated through a contour-enhanced funnel plot adjusted by the Duval and Tweedie trim and fill method (Shi and Lin 2020). Asymmetry in the funnel plot indicated the effect of small studies in the pooled results. To confirm the absence of asymmetry, a p value greater than 0.05 must be reached in the Harbord\u2019s test (Harbord et\u00a0al. 2006) and the Egger bias test (Egger et\u00a0al. 1997)."

Once the studies underwent the screening and eligibility steps, 16 randomised control trials were included for the qualitative synthesis and quantitative analysis. There was no disagreement between reviewers in the study selection process. Figure\u00a01 showed the PRISMA flowchart detailing the selection\nprocedure. Excluded studies and their reasons are detailed in Supplemental Material 2.\nRegarding the quality assessments, the PEDro scale results are shown in Supplemental Material 3. PEDro scores were reported from the included studies: thirteen with level I evidence (Lozano-Quilis et\u00a0al. 2014; Hoang et\u00a0al. 2016; Kalron et\u00a0al. 2016; Calabr\u00f2 et\u00a0al. 2017; Peruzzi et\u00a0al. 2017; Russo et\u00a0al. 2018; Khalil et\u00a0al. 2019; Munari et\u00a0al. 2020; Ozkul et\u00a0al. 2020; Tollar et\u00a0al. 2020; Molhemi et\u00a0al. 2021, 2022; Pagliari et\u00a0al. 2021) and three with level II (Brichetto et\u00a0al. 2015; Robinson et\u00a0al. 2015; Yazgan et\u00a0al. 2020). Most studies were single blinded, with the assessor being blinded to participant allocation. In addition, the ROB-2 overall score reported that most studies presented some concerns,\nbut only three studies (Robinson et\u00a0al. 2015; Ozkul et\u00a0al. 2020; Yazgan et\u00a0al. 2020) had a \u2018high risk\u2019 of bias (Fig.\u00a02). Disagreements between reviewers occasionally occurred for domain 2, but consensus was always reached without the participation of the third reviewer."

Furthermore, eight studies (Lozano-Quilis et\u00a0al. 2014; Brichetto et\u00a0al. 2015; Hoang et\u00a0al. 2016; Munari et\u00a0al. 2020; Tollar et\u00a0al. 2020; Yazgan et\u00a0al. 2020; Molhemi et\u00a0al. 2021, 2022) involved participants with any type of multiple sclerosis (relapsing\u2013remitting, secondary progressive, and primary progressive) without subgroup analysis.\nConcerning the immersion of the virtual reality systems, 14 studies employed non-immersive virtual reality as the main experimental intervention and four of them used the Wii Fit system (Brichetto et\u00a0al. 2015; Robinson et\u00a0al. 2015; Khalil et\u00a0al. 2019; Yazgan et\u00a0al. 2020). Only two trials used fully immersive virtual reality (Kalron et\u00a0al. 2016; Ozkul et\u00a0al. 2020).\nMost studies compared the virtual reality intervention to improve balance or gait to conventional balance training (n = 13, 81.25%) (Lozano-Quilis et\u00a0al. 2014; Brichetto et\u00a0al. 2015; Robinson et\u00a0al. 2015; Hoang et\u00a0al. 2016; Kalron et\u00a0al. 2016; Peruzzi et\u00a0al. 2016; Calabr\u00f2 et\u00a0al. 2017; Russo et\u00a0al. 2018; Khalil et\u00a0al. 2019; Ozkul et\u00a0al. 2020; Molhemi et\u00a0al. 2021, 2022; Pagliari et\u00a0al. 2021), followed by roboticassisted gait training (n = 3, 18.75%) (Calabr\u00f2 et\u00a0al. 2017; Peruzzi et\u00a0al. 2017; Munari et\u00a0al. 2020). The lowest number of sessions performed was 8 (Robinson et\u00a0al. 2015), while the highest was 54 (Russo et\u00a0al. 2018). Most authors proposed a frequency of intervention of 2 times per week with a minimum time per session of 30\u00a0min (Hoang et\u00a0al. 2016; Kalron et\u00a0al. 2016) and a maximum of 85\u00a0min (Calabr\u00f2 et\u00a0al. 2017).\nThe mean number of dropout events for the experimental group was 1.61 cases and 1.88 for the comparator group. The highest number of dropouts in the virtual reality groups was registered by Hoang et\u00a0al. (2016) and Pagliari et\u00a0al. (2021). The reasons reported by the authors for dropout in both groups were: difficulties reaching the research centre, transportation problems, scheduling problems, moving to another city, refusal to participate, personal or familial issues, lack of motivation or time, loss of data due to administrative problems, exacerbation of symptoms, disease relapse, work intensity, and illness/medical reasons/hospitalisation not related to multiple sclerosis. Three studies did not report any dropout events during the intervention or follow-up period (Brichetto et\u00a0al. 2015; Calabr\u00f2 et\u00a0al. 2017; Russo et\u00a0al. 2018)."

            "text": "A total of 16 randomised control trials reporting dropouts were meta-analysed to calculate the overall pooled dropout rate of virtual reality-based interventions for the improvement of balance and gait in patients with multiple sclerosis. The main clinical implication of the results of our study was that the virtual reality-based training for balance and gait in people with multiple sclerosis was highly accepted with a low dropout rate and high adherence during the study period. Torous et\u00a0al. (2020) suggested that the retention in research contexts could change when experimental approaches are translated into a clinical setting. This could be especially important for long rehabilitation programmes in chronic conditions. A recent study (Hortob\u00e1gyi et\u00a0al. 2022) reported a high adherence rate to a two-year maintenance programme including exergaming in people with multiple sclerosis; however, the sample size was very small, and more research about long-term adherence to virtual reality rehabilitation in this population is needed.\nAdherence is one of the main conflicts faced in rehabilitation; the therapeutic approach of multiple sclerosis\nis not an exception. As a result, looking for rehabilitation therapies that achieve higher participant compliance to treatment is vital (Arafah et\u00a0al. 2017). If correct adherence is not achieved, the effectiveness of the rehabilitation might be limited and incur additional healthcare costs (Jack et\u00a0al. 2010; Room et\u00a0al. 2021). Accordingly, the previous literature has proposed that virtual reality strategies presented higher adherence in patients with neurological disorders (Asadzadeh et\u00a0al. 2021; Dalmazane et\u00a0al. 2021). Nonetheless, our results suggested lower dropout rates in virtual reality-based interventions, which may be confirmed with larger sample sizes. This idea is supported by the prediction intervals, which stated that our findings could change with future trials. The recent systematic review of Bevens et\u00a0al. (2021) analysed the dropout rate in people with multiple sclerosis who received digital health interventions, showing no significant differences between experimental and control comparators. Therefore, we can consider that the adherence to virtual reality or other technological approaches were at least similar to other interventions.\nDuring the screening process, several studies were discarded because dropouts were not mentioned. Despite CONSORT guidelines stating the need to report complete data, many authors do not know how to handle dropouts (Bell et\u00a0al. 2013). To address this issue, it is necessary to standardise the way in which the reason and number of dropouts are described, for example, using the CONSORT flowchart of the study period. Also, further details of dropouts could help to make decisions regarding which interventions to offer to whom (Wright et\u00a0al. 2021).\nOur meta-regression data showed that the type of intervention, number, duration, and frequency of sessions, weeks of intervention, disability score, phenotype, sex, and methodological quality were not predictors of dropouts. Although it seems that a higher frequency of sessions could favour participant dropouts, no significant results were found. Similar results were obtained by Dennett et\u00a0al. (2020), who stated that there was no relationship between the frequency of exercise-based sessions and dropouts, but duration modified the likelihood of dropouts. Although our protocol included the analysis according to the level of immersion, fully immersive and semi-immersive virtual reality was excluded from the moderator analysis because of the limited number of studies included. Therefore, we suggest to provide a specific dropout rate analysis when the proportion of studies using immersive virtual reality rises, since higher immersion and presence levels are expected to achieve a higher treatment adherence (Rose et\u00a0al. 2018; D\u0119bska et\u00a0al. 2019). Additionally, future studies should evaluate enjoyment and motivation with specific measurement scales, allowing researchers to understand whether motivation or enjoyment during the intervention is predictors of dropout or adherence to treatment in the targeted population.\n1 3\nAccording to the literature (Grover et\u00a0al. 2021), adverse events due to treatment are considered one of the main causes of dropouts. Nonetheless, we were unable to analyse them as a moderator of dropout rate, since none of the studies included reported the undesired effects of the virtual reality intervention. Two possible explanations behind the low number of studies describing adverse events or side effects because of the intervention were considered: the first is that participants did not actually have adverse effects due to the virtual reality-based intervention, and the second is that the authors decided not to report them. The latter idea is supported by Phillips et\u00a0al. (2019) and Pitrou et\u00a0al. (2009), who addressed methodological weaknesses in reporting adverse events in randomised control trials, leading to a misinterpretation of intervention safety."

The findings of this review could help future randomised control trials to calculate their sample size to avoid dropout bias. Furthermore, no heterogeneity between the included studies was found in the analysis. The sensitivity analysis did not report any randomised control trial as an outlier that could strongly influence the overall size effect. Moreover, the funnel plot did not show any publication bias.\nThe main limitation of this review was the small sample size that the randomised control trials included, so a larger overall sample size would make our results more reliable. Another issue was that many studies did not report detailed reasons for dropouts. Furthermore, adverse events were not reported, so it was not possible to determine whether they could be moderators for dropout rate."

Our analysis reported no differences in dropout rate for participants who received virtual reality-based interventions versus other comparators; however, the lower dropout rate in the virtual reality group could indicate that the inclusion of larger sample sizes would show a significant difference in favour of the virtual reality group. The number, duration, frequency, and weeks of sessions, sex, age, phenotype, disability, and methodological quality were not determined to be moderators of dropouts. Adverse events were not reported by the studies included, making it impossible to analyse their influence as moderators.\nFuture randomised control trials should standardise the description of dropout causes and adverse effects of the rehabilitation treatments. Furthermore, the advantages of virtual reality, such as motivation and enjoyment, should be systematically assessed in clinical trials to determine whether these outcomes are indeed moderators of dropout and adherence.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s10055- 022- 00733-4.\nAuthors contribution MJC-H and CG-M were involved in conceptualisation and writing, review and editing; CG-M, MJC-H contributed to methodology; CG-M were involved in software and formal analysis; MJC-H, CG-M, MDC-V, RM-V, JAM-M and DL-A contributed to writing\u2014original draft preparation; MDC-V and R-MV were involved in visualisation; MDC-V, JAM-M and DL-A contributed to supervision; MJC-H and CG-M contributed equally to this work.
