This article presents insights from research investigating the end-of-life needs of Aboriginal and culturally and linguistically diverse people living in Western Sydney, Australia. This region has a large rapidly growing, and highly diverse population and on average low socioeconomic status. The research was guided by an advisory panel made up of representatives of supportive and palliative medicine, bereavement support, Aboriginal health, and multicultural health facilities. It aimed to generate findings to support the delivery of culturally sensitive services in the public health system.\nMethod: The multi-method design and the conduct of the research were informed by the literature on researching with marginalized groups which highlights the ethical considerations needed to avoid replicating past injustices. Qualitative data was generated from key informants and community focus groups.\nResults: The analysis revealed seven themes and some suggested solutions which were relevant across several themes. The seven themes were: the Need for trusted relationships; Talking about death and dying; Knowledge of key services; Decisionmaking and obtaining consent from the patient; Appropriate physical spaces; Cultural practices around EOL; and Language barriers.\nDiscussion: Within each theme a variety of cultural beliefs and practices were revealed that conflicted with mainstreammedical systems, indicating the need for changes in such systems. \u2018Compassionate Communities\u2019 was identified as amodel to support the necessary changes.\nKEYWORDS\nend-of-life care, culturally and linguistically diverse people, Aboriginal people, palliative care, health promoting palliative care, medical system\n1. Introduction\nAccess to palliative and supportive care has been recognized by the World Health Organization as a global ethical responsibility (1). Palliative care is for individuals who have a life-limiting illness and their families. It is care that focuses on improving the patient\u2019s quality of life by meeting their holistic needs (physical, emotional, psychosocial, and spiritual) in a manner that aligns with the patient\u2019s care preferences. Sometimes, this care will be known as \u201cSupportive Care\u201d when it is early in the disease trajectory or treats complications of the disease such as infection or metabolic issues that cause symptoms. Much of supportive and palliative care will be directed at living well in the last months or even years of life. Palliative care also involves helping the person and family prepare for the person\u2019s last weeks and days\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 01 frontiersin.org\nof life (the \u201cEnd-of-Life\u201d phase) and their death. It aims to ensure a death of comfort and dignity supported by high-quality care that aligns with their goals and values (2).\nConcerns have been raised internationally about the palliative care needs ofmigrants and First Nations people. Key considerations formedical staff involve how best to communicate about the disease and prognosis, the treatment choices made, and the care goals and preferences during the EOL phase, including the death rituals and observances (3, 4). For migrant communities, there is particular concern about the marginalization of those with limited English. Some examples are Barwise et al. (5) and Abedini et al. (6) in the U.S.; Elkan et al. (7) in the U.K.; Six et al. (8) in Belgium; Nowara et al. (9) in Germany; and Sacchi et al. (10) in Italy. First Nations peoples in developed countries have reduced life expectancies, particularly from chronic diseases, and the lack of access to and take up of palliative care services is an ongoing concern [Shahid et al. (11), cross-national; Gebauer et al. (12), U.S.; Canadian Virtual Hospice (13); Gott et al. (14), N.Z.]. Australia has a dedicated National Palliative Care Strategy (2018) which declares that high-quality evidence-based palliative care should be accessible to all citizens. It was rated fourth out of 81 countries for its EOL care (15). However, there is a lack of detailed nationally consistent data (16), especially for urban Aboriginal communities (17), which would guide the delivery of services in local statebased health districts. The data that do exist show that Aboriginal and culturally and linguistically diverse (CaLD) Australians are currently under-served (18).\nTheoretical analyses of modern Western health systems support concerns about the unmet palliative care needs of First Nations and culturally and linguistically diverse (CaLD) peoples. The principles of palliative care, with its holistic focus on care rather than cure for the patient and their family, stand in contrast to at least three overriding attributes of most medical systems. First, the fragmentation of care (19) contrasts with a holistic focus. Second, the dominance of mechanistic physiology (20) neglects the phenomenological experiences of the patient with its attention to cure over care (19). Third, health\u2019s implicit economic function (19) sees the institution of medicine existing to ensure citizens remain healthy enough to contribute as workers and consumers (21). Thus, people at end-of-life (EOL) especially those who are culturally or economically marginalized will not be a priority of neo-liberal health systems (21).\nHowever, there are alternative models. Health-promoting palliative care (22) emphasizes trusting relationships and networks of care across health services and communities. This public health approach to EOL care is encapsulated in the \u201ccompassionate communities\u201d movement (22). Here, dying, caring, and death are not constructed as solely medical events, but as social events (23\u201325). Moving from systems focused on mechanistic physiology and economics to compassionate communities needs, according to Rosenberg et al. (26), to be guided by three principles: reevaluation of organizational values; recognition of the primacy of caring networks; and realignment of the inherent paternalism in healthcare provision. These are not necessarily easy changes. They are changes that need to be informed by an appreciation of, and sensitivity to, the cultural diversity of people living and dying within our communities. To that end, this article reports on research designed to amplify the cultural voices often marginalized within the context of EOL care to learn about their EOL and\nbereavement needs. The research was conducted in Australia and has implications for other national health systems servicing First Nations peoples and significant migrant communities.\nMore specifically, the research was undertaken within Western Sydney Local Health District (WSLHD). This is a large health jurisdiction with a rapidly growing and highly diverse population, many of whom live with entrenched disadvantages and significant chronic health problems. Public transport and other infrastructure have not kept pace with population growth (27, 28). The current census data (29) show that over one million people (1,1080,820) live in WSLHD. Almost 58.3% of people are non-English speakers at home. The three largest CaLD groups in the LHD are people from Mandarin (6.5%), Hindi (3.5%), and Arabic (5.3%) speaking backgrounds, which are also large language groups across the world (30). Australia\u2019s First Nations peoples comprise many culturally and linguistically diverse groups, many historically displaced from their communities in the Country, and many acculturated to urban life (31). Compared with most LHDs in Australia, Western Sydney has a relatively high number of Aboriginal people (16,614), making up 1.5% of the population. Concerningly, relatively few reach old age. Nationally, only 1.7% are over 75 years, whereas the proportion for the general population is 7.5% (32).\nResearchers from Western Sydney University\u2019s Caring at Endof-Life Research Program worked with WSLHD partners to hear from the community about their culturally specific EOL and bereavement needs. The Caring at End-of-Life Research Program at Western Sydney University addresses the role of informal caring networks and their relationship with formal service providers (33), compassionate communities (34), and community death literacy (35). The WSLHD Advisory Panel consisted of representatives of Supportive and PalliativeMedicine, Bereavement support, Aboriginal Health, andMulticultural Health. Together, the researchers and Advisory Panel collaborated to set clear research goals and to develop relevant research questions to achieve them. The specific aim of the research was to conduct a bereavement and palliative care needs analysis to understand (1) the end-of-life needs of Aboriginal and CaLD communities and (2) how services need to adapt to deliver culturally appropriate EOL care. The research questions were:\n(1) How do CALD and Aboriginal communities experience\ndeath, dying, and caring?\n(2) What do these communities already have that works? (3) What supports and services have they found useful, or\nbelieve could be useful, and how is this different from what is already available? (4) What other support or services do they need and who is best\nsuited to provide this support and/or services?\n(5) In what ways do existing services and supports need to\nchange to be culturally appropriate?"

This multi-modal, multi-lingual, multi-disciplinary project was developed with the research partners. Aboriginal Health requested the nomenclature Aboriginal rather than Indigenous or First Nations. The research was also informed by input from 17 cultural advisors who represented the four cultural groups participating in the research (Aboriginal, Arabic, Hindi, and Mandarin). The methods followed consolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research (38) guidelines for the conduct of qualitative research. The design and conduct of the research were also informed by the literature on researching vulnerable and marginalized groups (39\u201341) which highlights the ethical considerations needed to avoid replicating past injustices. Indigenous Australians and migrant communities have often been subjected to disrespectful and exploitative practices in research including a lack of significant benefit for those being researched (42, 43).\nFrom the outset, the purpose of the research was to amplify marginalized cultural voices to better understand their needs in the palliative and bereavement context. In turn, these valuable perspectives can inform policy and system change recommendations to enable culturally safe and appropriate services for people from different cultural backgrounds and those who care for them at EOL. However, in acknowledging people are the \u201cexperts\u201d on their own experience, affording them epistemic privilege meant more than hearing their voices as expert research \u201csubjects\u201d (39). We sought to foster a relationship of equality and genuine participation as co-researchers and co-designers. The exchange of knowledge among the research team members and between researchers and participants ensured that the research goals would be achieved in ways that were simultaneously culturally sensitive.\nWe approached the research from a position of cultural humility (44) and respectful practices which focused on listening and supporting people to participate. We were inspired also by the Indigenous concept of \u201cDadirri\u201d which involves reciprocity, sharing stories, \u201cdeep listening,\u201d self-reflection, and patience [see West et al. (45)]. Normally applied in indigenist research, the principles of Dadirri are equally relevant to all marginalized people since it positions participants as equal to researchers, giving those who are normally powerless an equal voice in the research process. We ensured our collection of data was informed by Multicultural Education Officers for each cultural group and representatives of Aboriginal Health. The voice of participants was at the center of our research project, and in this article, we focus specifically on the qualitative data derived from the community focus groups and key informant interviews held with all four cultural groups. It was this data that most strongly revealed the challenges to current medical models."

After the easing of community \u201clockdowns,\u201d recruitment was understandably slow. People were grieving and coming to terms with the significant losses in their communities both in Australia and overseas during the pandemic. There were also ongoing concerns about health vulnerabilities which meant the integration of COVID protocols into the focus group procedures so that participants and researchers felt safe."

The Hindi focus group was conducted in English, as the majority of participants spoke and/or understood English.

We presented a written hypothetical vignette about a person not known to the participants and they were invited to build upon that story through a series of prompting questions relating to the scenario. The vignette and prompt questions were designed to address the research aims and were prepared in collaboration with the Advisory Panel. The CaLD advisors agreed that vignettes would be an effective tool for their communities to approach the discussion. Professional translations of the vignettes were checked by the Multicultural Education co-facilitators to ensure the integrity of meaning. The Aboriginal advisors chose to use the prompt questions without vignettes to elicit discussion of participants\u2019 past experiences. Along with providing a gentle way to lead into the discussion, the vignette and prompt questions proved useful to keep the conversation topic centered on EOL and the aims of the project."

However, there are people within the health system that insist that different cultures need to adapt to the medical culture.

You can\u2019t have it both ways . . . because we\u2019re in amedical institution . . . they need to follow the rules. And Anglos can follow the rules so why can\u2019t they? (Volunteer coordinator)\nIn social contexts where there is little trust in government services and the fairness of the law, it makes sense for people to rely\non trusted relationships or a chain of trusted relationships. Trust needs to be proactively developed over time:\nTo develop trust, health workers need to walk with them for a while not just provide information. Health workers need to check in with their clients not just go in with a set spiel so they need to research how to approach that conversation and what they can do with the person and what they might offer or not offer that isn\u2019t going to offend them and disconnect them. (Social worker)\nAboriginal people have experienced systematic abuse for over two centuries and still experience discrimination. They cannot ask for help and assume that they will be treated respectfully and given appropriate assistance. It is not surprising, therefore, that they want to deal with Aboriginal staff in hospitals and home care. If there are no Aboriginal staff in the relevant positions, then they would like an Aboriginal person with some authority to accompany them until the new relationship can be established:\nThat first visit where I will go in and make the connection\u2014 sit down and have a chat and talk about where they\u2019re from and you know, it\u2019s quite a non-threatening visit. And then never to do an assessment at that first visit unless it\u2019s vitally important. And that\u2019s what they said, \u2018If you do an assessment in that first visit, you\u2019ll lose them\u2019. (Aboriginal Community Nurse)\nPeople in CaLD communities, even if they are not refugees, often come from places where there has been recent social upheaval, corruption, or few affordable services. As a result, they do not have confidence in health services here. Furthermore, although many Australians are welcoming of migrants, there is enough racism around for CaLD people to be cautious:\nin [named] Hospital, you see the doctor . . . she was\nwondering whether it is discrimination, because you can check on their face. . . . they just said, it\u2019s in your head, it\u2019s your mind. They couldn\u2019t find the problem. (Mandarin focus group)\nOf course, language is another concern for many. Even if they have adequate English for everyday purposes, they can be excluded by the language of the health system. So, they want to work through people from their cultural and language backgrounds and favor\ntrusted relationships.\nThis focus on relationships is at odds with the health system, which focuses on efficiency and does not allocate time for relationship development. Furthermore, EOL often involves multiple visits to a hospital with a variety of symptoms over several weeks or months. People are allocated to different departments depending on the part of the body affected. Patients are unlikely to see the same doctors and nurses when they return to the hospital unless they are in a specialist unit such as Cancer Care or a Palliative Care Unit (PCU).\nAlthough in some general practices in the community people see a different doctor each time, there are general practitioners (GPs) who have a long-term relationship with their patients. This line of communication often does not connect with the hospital as they are organized as separate systems:\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 05 frontiersin.org\nEven when there is a GP with shared culture and language, patients and families can feel abandoned when the patient goes into palliative care if the GP does not continue to follow up with them. (Multicultural Health worker)\nHowever, the community nurses and Palliative Care Unit staff are gradually building connections from the hospital to the GPs when the patient is at home:\nYou\u2019re the medico that is looking after this patient. We\u2019re not taking over care. You\u2019re still looking after the patient and we\u2019re helping you to do that, and this is how we\u2019ll help you. (Clinical Nurse Consultant)\nCommunity services are also fragmented, and community workers associated with the PCU are distressed when they need to hand over their patients to an entirely different service:\nWe support them through their chemo, their radiation\u2014the whole thing. And then right at the point where they\u2019re literally dying, we have to say goodbye . . . And then we need to choose another service and I say, \u2018Oh look (Palliative homecare service) will take you over. As of tomorrow, we\u2019re not allowed to come in\u2019 . . . They will get an after-hours service and doctor home visiting and that\u2019s through (Palliative homecare service) so there\u2019s some benefits, but the hardest thing is saying goodbye to people before they actually die. (Aboriginal Community Nurse)\nBeing treated with empathy, respect, and dignity\nwas important:\nIn Syria, in our city, there\u2019s an association called \u201cAl-Afia\u201d they are responsible for funding major expensive surgeries such as heart surgeries. Merchants make contributions to fund this association. . . . They treat people with dignity. . . (In Australia) I would like for the government to take care of this in order to protect people\u2019s dignity. (Arabic focus group)\nThis paramedic was standing and telling her \u201cBe prepared\u201d. The mother was shocked. How can she be prepared? Is her son dying? Did he die? The paramedic said in a very rough way, without any affection, or any emotion \u201cI didn\u2019t say this.\u201d This is a concern regarding healthcare people. Before you treat the body, you should treat the soul. . . . I agree with her. This is the humane side that we miss a lot in all aspects of life in Australia. . . . You find that everything is so materialistic, as if they are dealing with a block and not with human beings. (Arabic focus group)\nSome respondents recognized the fundamental changes that would need to take place for health facilities to be safe respectful places for all patients:\nIf you\u2019re really going to be a really respectful kind of organization, you can\u2019t just pay it lip service and have all your staff do diversity training but then the rest of the machine works exactly the same.

Different cultures may have highly coded ways of undertaking these conversations, such as the term \u2018Sorry Business\u2019 being widely used by Aboriginal people. For some cultures, there is a concern that talking about death could invite it in. It could feel like a betrayal of the patient because everyone was giving up on them. Or the belief that seemingly miraculous recoveries were possible meant the patient needed to hold onto hope. It caused distress when patients and carers were required to talk about their situation repeatedly with strangers in each department or service:\nWhen I ring an interpreter and tell them this is a palliative call, it runs in direct contrast to a lot of Muslim beliefs of \u2018We don\u2019t talk about dying\u2019, we need to keep up hope for as long as possible . . . it does get tricky cause you\u2019re managing a culture, an ingrained cultural [belief].

(PCUManager)\nA reluctance to discuss death can make it difficult to formally plan for EOL. The health care system actively promotes Advance Care Plans whereby patients identify how they would like to be treated when they are not able to make decisions. This requires a detailed discussion of bodily decline and the likely success of possible treatments. To be effective, the plans need family support lest families become distressed and seek more intrusive treatment than the patient wanted.\nThere are added difficulties when people rely on government income support or public housing. Such supports have specific requirements which might be attached to the dying person so there is a risk that other family members will suffer financially,\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 06 frontiersin.org\nor children will be taken into foster care away from their culture and community:\nit\u2019s important to have these financial conversations as hard as they are, to put in place those measures so those kids don\u2019t get taken away, the house doesn\u2019t get taken away on top of the family\u2019s grief.

A literal translation could have a very different meaning. Often, interpreters want to explain the significance of what is being said, for example, why the family feels they need to feed the patient. In some\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 10 frontiersin.org\ninstances, there was a lack of trust in interpreters based on this issue:\nAnother dilemma for interpreters is if they are asked if they know of any relevant services, when their role is to simply interpret the words except for the specific cultural-related information. They are not allowed to give personal opinions, but it is difficult to always tell what is culture-specific and what is personal opinion. (Medical Interpreting Service Manager)\nUsing interpreting services might also make it difficult to connect with someone more deeply on the level that is needed for counseling. As a result, working with interpreting services on very sensitive matters can be seen as a barrier. The Mandarin focus group participants all had a phone number that gave them direct access to interpreters. However, being one of the most populous migrant groups and knowing there are many doctors and nurses of Chinese background, they expressed a preference for hospitals to put some effort into allotting them, Chinese staff.\nWith oral and written communications, for example, developing a factsheet, it is not enough to translate from English into another language. Culturally appropriate inclusive language is needed, also recognizing that sometimes this language cannot translate in any straightforward sense. Some roles and activities do not have a translation for other cultures. As already noted, some migrants are not familiar with the concepts of palliative care, volunteering, or counseling so these terms need the skill to translate, and more extensive explanations might be needed.\nLanguage differences can be used as a guide to augment current services. For example, where it is necessary to slow down and explain what is happening in the current palliative situation. It is a reminder that medical language and the jargon in the health services are often not clear to those of non-Englishspeaking backgrounds:\nEven if you\u2019re born here, you\u2019re raised in Australia, the health system in itself is overwhelming let alone with a terminal illness. (Clinical Nurse Consultant PCU)\nThe doctors are very good, and they try really hard but once you give over a couple of pieces of information [to the patient or family], the rest just goes in one ear and out the other. Just bounces off. They can\u2019t absorb it all. So, they go home and think about and they may ring back, and we discuss it. It is very overwhelming and culturally for a lot of people . . . it\u2019s a shock . . . with anybody, it\u2019s not just people who don\u2019t have English as their first language.

            "text": "The antidote for many of the sources of distress identified in the above themes was communication and the development of trusted relationships where people are treated as whole persons, not as health conditions. A successful model trialed during the\nperiod of this project was employing an Aboriginal Supportive and Palliative Care Worker who comes from the local community. They guide patients and families both within the hospital and in the community, standing up to the health establishment when necessary. Respondents who knew about this role were highly appreciative and those working with CaLD people wanted similar specialist workers:\nWe just need more Nicoles! (Culturally specific supportive\nand palliative care worker)\nRespondents from interviews and focus groups suggested that community education about EOL and palliative care was needed. To date, the focus of Multicultural Health education teams has been topics requested by communities, and no one had asked for information on palliative care. Indeed, they doubted that anyone would attend an information session due to the cultural resistance to talking about death and dying. However, younger generations are more open, and they could learn more about how to care for their parents. Furthermore, caring in the family is valued so information about palliative care framed as caring could be appreciated.\nMore diverse and extensive volunteer programs were also suggested. The valuable role of volunteers was recognized especially their freedom to work across health silos and into the community. Indeed, health staff were regretting the lack of volunteers under COVID restrictions. Suggestions included reaching out to communities to recruit volunteers from a wide variety of\ncultural backgrounds to support the diversity of patients. This includes people willing to be on call to help patients with specific language needs and creating a register for hospital staff. Therefore, a volunteer coordinator is present at each hospital to provide training and support, particularly in CaLD perspectives. Cultural\ntraining on Aboriginal perspectives is already a requirement. Furthermore, volunteers need training to understand the roles of social workers, community nurses, and others working in the EOL space so they could better coordinate their efforts. In return, the volunteers should be recognized as an integral part of the hospital team:\nThey do the 4 days of training when they start and then they continually do training . . . they become more Health Literate, so then when they go back to their own families or communities that they can share that insight... I see volunteer service, well particularly my volunteer service, as quite specialized and educated and literate. (Volunteer Coordinator)\nIn addition to the hospital-based volunteers, numerous\ncommunity and religious groups can provide voluntary support. Staff would like an up-to-date and thorough register of Aboriginal and CaLD community support people and services such as not-forprofit groups and religious leaders.\nOn the issue of funeral expenses, funeral funds were found to\nbe expensive scams whereby people lost everything if they missed one payment. One respondent said his church had a donation box for the costs at every funeral. Another practical suggestion was an agency that gave loans for that purpose:\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 11 frontiersin.org\nRegarding the funeral services, I say if any association or agency can financially help the family of the deceased. . . . because death happens suddenly. So, if we can pay them through installments that would be great. (Arabic focus group)\nIf these seven themes and suggestions were taken on board by the health and community services, then mainstream medical services would need to reexamine their orientation and priorities and be prepared to change."

The first three themes tell us that it is important for people to know and trust care providers; there are cultural limitations around discussing death and dying; and there are relatively low levels of knowledge about palliative care and the various services available to assist with care in the last months, weeks, and days of life. The interplay between these three themes is shown to contribute to reduced access to culturally appropriate quality palliative and EOL care. There is a negative cycle among the three themes whereby not talking about death and dying leads to limited knowledge about palliative care. In turn, this meant that patients and families lost the opportunity to develop the relationships of trust which were so important to them. Language barriers cut across the seven themes, aggravating all other issues."

            "heading": "4.2. Suggestions for ameliorating the problems",
            "text": "The research participants had a wide range of practical suggestions for improving EOL care for people from Aboriginal\nand diverse cultural groups. Many of these suggestions would be valuable for all people in need of EOL services. However, it is important to recognize that there are additional barriers for Aboriginal and CaLD people. Barriers to trust can be one of the most entrenched obstacles in the delivery of all forms of healthcare including palliative and EOL care. The treatment of First Nations peoples and migrants, especially refugees, by many governments, including Australia, is not a record that engenders trust. Migrants might also have had negative experiences with the government in their country of origin. Trust requires a strong relationship with people who can guide them and help them understand the strengths and limitations of the services on offer. Often, this needs to be someone from the same cultural background. Sometimes adult children have the education and resources to fulfill this role or a close relationship with their family doctor is another path for long-term migrants.\nSpatial considerations can also be important in building trust. Appropriate spaces with visual symbols and messages in multiple languages help to develop trust by sending the message that\nAboriginal and CaLD people are welcome and valued. So too, when spaces allow for the expression of culture. The aspects here\nare wide-ranging. They include the need for adequately sized spaces that can accommodate family and visitors of sometimes very\nlarge numbers; sensitively located spaces that can accommodate cultural rituals, music, or chanting; and dedicated areas for food\npreparation and consumption. In this research, the only place in the healthcare system identified as possessing flexibility of care allowing\nfor family visits, with suitable food, music, significant images, and rituals, was the palliative care unit. Yet, this flexibility is still very much needed in other parts of the health and community service systems. Given the diversity of places where people die\u2014emergency departments, hospital wards, nursing homes, ambulances, and their own homes\u2014the clear implication is that many more services need to consider a more flexible, culturally safe approach to care at the EOL. An effective palliative care model can pave the way for how the existing health services might respond to culturally specific needs at EOL.\nThe deployment of dedicated workers, not only with diverse languages but also from the cultural backgrounds of those accessing palliative care and bereavement support, is an urgent need. In\nthe research, there was a clear expression of support for such roles. The new Aboriginal Supportive and Palliative Care Worker\ndemonstrated that many of the problems of understanding the health system, bridging silos in services, and developing trust can\nbe effectively addressed through their role. No doubt that culturespecific Supportive and Palliative Care Workers could help CaLD\ncommunities too. However, there are inevitable questions about\nthe feasibility of this suggestion. The provision of culture-specific workers for all of the 170 different language groups in Western\nSydney would be costly. Is it viable to provide one Multicultural Supportive and Palliative Care Worker who would coordinate the needs of all CaLD people in the LHD? Could there be several to cover the large language groups? Could people from diverse backgrounds already working within the health system be trained as \u201ccare navigators\u201d who can guide others around the system. Given that CaLD people make up over 50% of the WSLHD population, there is a strong case for many more culturally specific workers,\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 12 frontiersin.org\nand this would assist with improving the equity of palliative and EOL care to significant sections of a diverse community.\nAnother challenge is presented when considering how to provide culturally appropriate information and education about palliative and EOL care. Many people from culturally diverse groups do not want to talk about EOL, at least not outside their cultural norms. This may also be due to wanting to \u201chold on to hope,\u201d wanting to avoid summoning death by considering it or talking about it, or just being uncomfortable with the topic, as is the case for many in the general population, too. The literature is clear that we cannot engage in cultural stereotyping when considering how best to address EOL and palliative care needs in the setting of life-limiting illness (51). Skillful communication in the setting of a trusted therapeutic alliance is especially important in these cases. Furthermore, considering local strategies within cultural groups to provide information and answer questions about service provision in the setting of age and illness may be a good starting point for conversations about how to best provide EOL information in a culturally safe way.\nMainstream Western culture has encouraged planning and open discussion around dying and provided information about advance care planning, services available, and how to ensure a death that minimizes distress for patients and families. Tapping into existing community programs such as Dying to Know Day and \u201cDeath Caf\u00e9\u2019s\u201d makes the conversations more normal; less taboo and shocking. Culturally acceptable forums within local community events might serve the same purpose. A strategy to make the education suggestions feasible is to tap into existing resources including, multicultural health services, palliative care education providers, and extending and supporting volunteer programs. Indeed, given the problems with communicating across silos of services, it is better for any new supports to be connected to existing organizations and programs.\nThe literature reviews of other countries show that the difficulties identified by Aboriginal and CaLD people in this study are not unique to Western Sydney (5\u20138, 11). Migration to Western countries is expected to continue to increase due to conflict and climate change; and the First Nations people living in neo-colonial countries continue to struggle with disadvantage. However, the suggested strategies for amelioration are also applicable internationally. Countries with Western-developed medical systems all have the resources to meet the suggestions identified in this research. Implementing the flexibility of care evident in some palliative care units in other areas of the health service; developing trust; providing suitable care spaces; employing dedicated workers with requisite cultural and/or language skills; and developing community knowledge about EOL services are all realizable goals. However, they require the will to prioritize equity of access to quality EOL care."

            "text": "The Compassionate Communities model advocates a move from current systems focused on mechanistic physiology and economics (21, 22) to local, civic, and corporate support initiatives for EOL. The aim here is to enable holistic supportive, palliative,\nand EOL care in and with the community where the patient and family are seen as people who are known and loved. The research results reflect the need for investing in a transition to Compassionate Communities (34, 52) via Rosenberg et al. (26) three principles: re-evaluation of organizational values; recognition of the primacy of caring networks; and realignment of the inherent paternalism in healthcare provision.\nIn re-orienting their organizational values, health services need to recognize that their assumptions are often not shared with those outside the health system. The adoption of Health Promoting Palliative Care would focus on relationships, respecting each patient as a whole person with their own lived experience and understanding of the world. Health providers, including nonspecialists and, in some cases, specialist providers of palliative and EOL care are usually pressed for time and focus on their particular area of treatment. Often \u201cKey Performance Indicator\u201d checklists need to be followed so the service can demonstrate adequate care. Although such checklists can cover actions such as the provision of cultural sensitivity training, they would be challenged to cover the development of relationships and trust. Indeed, it would be unfair for an individual staff member to be held responsible for the lack of trust due to years of societal prejudice and mistreatment. However, there does need to be a palliative and EOL care service delivery model that promotes a relationship of trust, to support the quality care wanted by communities, and care that is not compromised by the suspicion that the person was being abandoned or \u201cleft to die\u201d by a biased healthcare system. There needs to be EOL quality of care metrics that can evaluate the capacity of the service to support such relationships.\nMost EOL caring takes place at home and social network maps for patients and caregivers depict medical services on the periphery or absent (53). It is, therefore, important for the model of care and the medical services to accommodate the reality that these are occasional contributors to a larger story about culture, community, friends, and family. The primacy of caring networks means that they cannot be set aside by patients and caregivers when the patient is in the hospital. Good connections rather than silos of care are needed so patients can move from home to the hospital when necessary and return without major disruption to their identity and support network. Assistance so cultures can maintain their rituals, provision of appropriate areas with art, music, kitchens, and space to gather, including outdoor space, can all help to support the patient\u2019s identity and therefore wellbeing.\nBy and large, individual healthcare staff are generally dedicated people doing good work often at some personal sacrifice. However, they operate in a system that promotes a paternalistic view of patients and their families. The system dynamic suggests that patients and families should not only be grateful for the care they receive but also accept that it is they who must adjust their expectations and behaviors when they have a problem with the medical system. These messages are not respectful. They do not engender trust. We need to reconsider, for example, whether the dominant narrative of pushing for individual decision-making and open communication and education about EOL is dismissing alternative values and beliefs. People holding different cultural perspectives are unlikely to easily adopt the values and worldview of the medical system.\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 13 frontiersin.org\nIndeed, good caring is at odds with seeing people from the perspective of a mechanistic philosophy and public sector management framework that packages and standardizes healthcare in the name of \u201cefficiency\u201d at the cost of diverse individual needs (19). This approach typically guides EOL response and care in health systems across theWestern world. However, the results from this research do show that people need guidance to interact in that \u201cforeign territory,\u201d preferably from trusted people who know both the patient\u2019s culture and themedical system. Such guidance needs to go beyond interpreting the words spoken. It cannot be assumed that people are familiar with palliative and EOL concepts and services, nor can it be assumed that they can, or think they should, ask for the help they need."

            "text": "The research was comprehensive in its ambitions to reach diverse voices and in its multi-method approach that laid a basis for the triangulation of the findings from different data sets. However, there were also limitations to the research design. The scope of the research was focused on a single local health district (LHD), albeit one with a large and particularly diverse population. This was relevant for this particular study, which was State government funded for the express purpose of conducting a culturally focused bereavement and palliative care needs analysis within the Western Sydney LHD. There is one dedicated palliative care unit within the LHD which is known for its progressive approach to culturally diverse supportive and palliative care. Expressed satisfaction with this service may limit the generalizability of some findings, but it also provides useful data about what works for people, and this was a key goal of the research questions. Furthermore, many participants had experiences with other palliative care units within Australia or their country of origin. Although comparative research across health districts would potentially add to the significance of the findings, the results are, nevertheless, of relevance both locally and internationally.\nParticipation in the research was limited to the Aboriginal community and the three largest CaLD groups residing within the LHD. This meant that some significant language groups were not allowed to contribute to the research. However, the target groups (Mandarin, Hindi, and Arabic) included in the research are the second, third, and seventh languages spoken worldwide (30), so what they have to say matters. A further limitation was that people were recruited for focus groups through LHD services. Again, while relevant for the project, hearing the voices of those using private or community \u201cservices\u201d outside the public health system could potentially have contributed rich data about EOL experiences. The focus group participants were also limited to those who felt able to participate in face-to-face groups in the context of COVID. This no doubt prevented people, such as those with health vulnerabilities, from coming forward to share their views and experiences. Despite these limitations, the qualitative research generated important findings about the cultural needs of significant population groups, in breadth, if not in absolute participant numbers."

            "text": "The changes in service culture and models of care indicated by this research are not necessarily low-cost or simple to implement. However, they are possible with a broader and more nuanced public debate on how diverse multicultural societies want to experience end-of-life and bereavement. The results from this study both prompt and contribute to such a debate. Many of the EOL challenges faced by culturally diverse people and groups can also be faced by those from the dominant culture who are not \u201cdeath literate.\u201d The range of issues raised here are all reasonable requests for bridging such a gap: knowledge of the systems and services; help discussing EOL needs in a respectful way; guidance in making decisions about medical treatment; performing EOL rituals that are important to us; having home comforts such as the food we like; and support of friends and family when in hospital.\nBarriers due to language differences and past experiences of discrimination exacerbate the challenge of having one\u2019s needs met. Recognizing the needs of diverse and marginalized communities\u2014 such as the Aboriginal, Arabic, Mandarin, and Hindi-speaking groups in this research\u2014is an important step toward understanding the diversity of needs and the challenges to managing EOL in a way that minimizes trauma and strengthens the bonds among people. It can be a time for friends and family to gather and connect and show respect to the dying person. The acceptance across society of a Compassionate Communities model would recognize the fundamentally social and cultural, rather than medical, nature of death, dying, and bereavement and remind us that they are, indeed, everybody\u2019s business.\nData availability statement\nThe datasets presented in this article are not readily available because our ethics approval does not allow for this.
