1. **Investigate the effect of different processing methods on the release and bioaccessibility of IBPs.** This could be done by comparing the content of IBPs in foods before and after processing, as well as by measuring the amount of IBPs that are released during digestion. This information could be used to develop processing methods that maximize the release and bioaccessibility of IBPs.


2. **Study the metabolism of IBPs in the human body.** This could be done by tracking the fate of IBPs after they are consumed, either by measuring their concentration in blood and urine or by using stable isotope labeling techniques. This information could be used to determine the bioavailability of IBPs and to identify the metabolites that are formed.


3. **Explore the potential health benefits of IBPs.** This could be done by conducting in vitro and in vivo studies to investigate the effects of IBPs on various aspects of health, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and cancer. This information could be used to develop new dietary recommendations and to identify potential therapeutic applications for IBPs.


4. **Develop new methods for extracting and analyzing IBPs.** Current methods for extracting and analyzing IBPs are often time-consuming and expensive. There is a need for new methods that are more efficient and cost-effective. This would make it easier to study IBPs and to develop new products that contain them.


5. **Investigate the role of IBPs in the gut microbiome.** IBPs are known to be fermented by gut bacteria, and this fermentation can produce a variety of metabolites that have potential health benefits. There is a need to study the role of IBPs in the gut microbiome in more detail, in order to better understand how they can be used to promote gut health.
