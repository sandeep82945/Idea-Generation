    "abstractText": "Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are essential to global green growth and are a driving force of eco-innovation. With their capability of fast pivoting, they have become critical players in emerging green industry markets. New firms can especially distinguish themselves in developing sustainable markets with novel, creative, and innovative approaches. Simultaneously, radical innovations in sustainability continue to attract increasing attention. These include the development of green energy generation and storage technologies, bioenergy solutions, the application of eco-innovations, novel municipal waste reduction models, and the wide-scale revision of existing business models. Given SMEs\u2019 role in growing markets, this study aims tomap academically studied explanations for current models that are deemed successful.We use a systematic mapping study focusing on English language publications devoted to SMEs. The studies selected were publications on environmentally sustainable waste management conducted successfully by SMEs. The studies for the mapping study analysis were selected using several relevant keywords and PRISMA methodology. The authors studied all 127 contributing publications on SMEs engaged in environmental activities, published from 2015 to 2022. This study investigated current trends and identified the most promising areas of environmental activities and sustainable business practices in the SME context. The distribution of recent research across industry sectors and locations has revealed research gaps and provided directions for future research. We have identified the eight most popular sustainability practices and environmental activities in the SME context. The practical implications of the study could help enterprise owners learn about various opportunities for the implementation and pursuit of sustainable economic, social, and environmental development.

On the one hand, the importance of sustainable business practices has arisen from the need for positive environmental solutions. On the other hand, for many companies,\n56900 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Regarding practical solutions, many services, products, and business activities could contribute to improving the positive effect on our environment. Their contribution generates new jobs, societal improvements, and innovations. At the national level, environmental issues and the rational use of resources to reduce harmful ecological impacts are now a significant part of strategic plans, political dialogue, and the activities of governments and businesses worldwide [4], [5]. However, the human impact has caused the continuance of adverse environmental events, the threat of crucial resource exhaustion, and increasing climatic shifts in recent years, showing that certain ecological management practices may have been reduced to mere bureaucratic routines [6]. Such events signal to stakeholders and managers that it may be reasonable to rethink the role of environmental management by companies, as such methods do not always tangibly reward stakeholders. Managers can attempt to integrate principles for the rational use of resources with crucial business processes and outline ways to build green production chains.\nRecent global crises, such as climate change, degraded air quality, deforestation, biodiversity loss, and stratospheric ozone depletion, demonstrate that the traditional economic model aimed at the unrelenting consumption of natural resources and services needs to be reviewed [7]. In recent years, [8] concepts of circular economy (conceptualized 30 years ago) (CE) [9] and green practices are actively being re-developed for the sustainable crowd [10] activities by NGOs, research organizations, corporations, and several national governments [11]. These activities involve the systematic introduction of environmental rules that transform strategies (product transporting supply chains, for example [12]) and even push for fundamental changes in companies\u2019 business models. Therefore, society and businesses must shift to a new, more sustainable economic model [13], [14], [15]. The boundless growth of technological and industrial potential, and the continuous introduction of new products to the market, which are then marketed as must-haves for people, have led to environmental degradation and huge e-wastage [16]; this now poses a present and future threat to society [17]. This cycle creates difficulties for future generations because they will face the repercussions later. That is why economic activities that do not destroy and stress the natural environment but increase the Earth\u2019s natural wealth have come to the fore in many countries. Products and manufacturing processes are being developed to be less environmentally harmful. Some examples of climate change mitigation methods are renewable energy, waste recycling, intensification of forestry, organic agricultural products, ecological tourism, wastewater, air treatment, and energy-efficient transportation [18], [19].\nCurrently, discussions in scientific and political circles are increasingly focused on green economy issues. In 2016, at the eleventh meeting of the G20 summit in Hangzhou,\nthe leaders of 19 countries recognized the importance of a green economy and the need to increase green financing to maintain environmentally sustainable global growth [20]. In recent years, there has been a growing consensus among scientists [21] and policymakers that the current model of economic development, based on the consumption of finite resources and the generation of waste, is unsustainable in the long term. Hence, there is increasing interest in exploring alternative economic models that are sustainable and can prioritize environmental protection and reduce barriers to green innovations [22], [23]. In general, compliance with the principles of sustainable development and employing socially responsible business practices are critical directions for many companies. The concept of sustainable development has grown from an exclusively ecological vision and is now integrating companies and individual entrepreneurs into a local or global socio-economic community. Here successful businesses are directly linked with sustainable development and social responsibility. Countries and companies are still in the middle of transitioning to new, sustainable processes and models. Therefore, environmentally oriented economies remain in need of more creative innovation. Without innovative resource-saving technologies, it is impossible to enhance the efficient distribution and consumption of natural resources.\nA company\u2019s resources depend on its consumers and investors. To a large extent, the market dictates the price consumers are willing to pay for a product. This is a basic economic principle that companies naturally abide by. Sometimes, the capabilities and habits of a company become obstacles to the introduction of breakthrough innovations. The Resources-Processes-Values model from Christensen\u2019s Innovator\u2019s dilemma reveals that resources, people, or organizational structures determine the processes employed. They are tied to the company\u2019s values, not the publicly professed ones. A company that wants to incorporate breakthrough innovations into its processes and outcomes should be prepared to transform its present values, processes, and resources by utilizing modern technologies and being ready to move from traditional business models to new novel models [24]. We believe that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) can perform the unique role of forming such an economy. Due to their ability to respond to ongoing economic changes [25], [26] faster, they contribute to accelerating innovation processes in the circular and traditional economy.\nTherefore, the sustainable economic development model is becoming a priority for successful SMEs [27], [28]. The structure of the concept of sustainable development recognizes the continuity of three aspects \u2013 social, economic, and environmental. Modern businesses that rely on short-term, fast economic profits fail to be able to build genuine trust between SME network partners to achieve long-term shared win-win results [29] and limits them to see the interconnections between the three sustainability aspects and the efficacy of environmental practices and their long-term effects [30].\nVOLUME 11, 2023 56901\nThe scientific novelty is restructuring existing environmental practices in the SME context and highlighting existing gaps for further studies.\nThe rising combined effect of global problems, such as climate change, global warming, and the trend of green consumption, entails changes in current practices. Companies are forced to consider reductions in their negative environmental impacts. Due to the trend of conscious consumption, buyers are also becoming more aware of the goods and services they consume. Generally, entrepreneurs are trying to reduce the material intensity of production, apply new technologies and make economic activity more environmentally friendly. The most effective approach to mitigating the impact of economic activity on the environment is the concept of sustainable development. This is, therefore, the significance and motivation of this study \u2013 we attempt to demonstrate the opportunities and successful solutions provided by environmental practices in the SME context.\nSMEs significantly impact the environment, often through their use of resources, emissions, and waste. SMEs are the backbone of Europe\u2019s economy. They represent 99% of all businesses in the EU [31]. By studying their environmental practices, we can identify ways to reduce this impact and promote sustainability. SMEs are subject to environmental regulations like larger organizations, including those related to waste management, emissions, and energy efficiency [32], [33]. Understanding their environmental practices can help ensure they comply with these regulations and avoid penalties. Innovation is another driver for the sustainability of SMEs [34], [35], [36]. Developing and implementing environmentally sustainable practices often requires innovation and creativity [37], [38]. Studying the environmental practices of SMEs can help us identify innovative solutions to environmental challenges and promote sustainable development. Exploration of the current studies has positive practical implications. It brings awareness towards existing solutions and innovation; therefore, SMEs will not need to spend time inventing similar ideas and studying already tested implementations and approaches again and again.\nThe research goal of this mapping study is to identify the current trends and most promising areas of development in the environmental activities and sustainable business practices of SMEs. The goal is to obtain practical implications and real-world examples for SMEs by analyzing answers to the research question, \u2018\u2018What are the current examples of successful environmental practices by SMEs, particularly in waste and recycling management?\u2019\u2019 We explore the patterns, challenges, and trends in the environmental activities of small and medium businesses by analyzing the results and content of recent studies on the subject. We conducted search queries in the Scopus database by Title, keywords, and abstract using waste AND sustainability. The search results did produce 29629 papers from 1981 to 2023. It is an enormous amount of work to process.\nMoreover, Figure 1 shows that the number of research papers is growing exponentially. Thus, exploring, analyzing, and synthase current literature is becoming crucial. Therefore, the primary goal of this study is reasonable.\nThis study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology. A literature search and analysis were conducted to achieve this goal by utilizing the following academic databases: Scopus, ACM, Science Direct, Web of Science, and IEEE. The databases were searched with the keywords: small and medium enterprises, sustainability, waste management, recycling, success, and benefit. One hundred twenty-seven relevant papers were chosen based on the eligibility criteria and search filters.\nA. BACKGROUND Although the individual environmental impact of one enterprise in the small and medium size category may be insignificant, SMEs together are a significant entity, and their combined influence on the environment is notable. Fortunately, an increasing number of enterprises are realizing the benefits of environmentally friendly production, which include reduced raw materials costs, compliance with environmental standards, improved customer relations, and an overall competitive advantage.\nSmall- and medium-sized businesses make valuable contributions to society:\n1) Creation of a progressively developing market. Experimental research is being conducted in small- and medium-sized businesses, new ideas are emerging, and significant changes are occurring. Since any innovation or evolution of established operations is accompanied by enormous costs and high risks for large companies, it is much easier and faster for small businesses to change their activity structures. 2) Healthy competition. Due to small- and medium-sized businesses\u2019 ability to adapt quickly to changes in con-\n56902 VOLUME 11, 2023\nsumer demand, they can actively compete with large companies that usually need much more time to reorganize their structures. 3) They are maintaining the openness of the economy. Small- and medium-sized businesses can quickly adapt to the demands of the consumer market, which is why this form of business can quickly and actively occupy profitable niches, especially in the export of goods and services. 4) The fight against unemployment. More than half the population of developed countries is employed in small and micro businesses. 5) Small- and medium-sized businesses are more susceptible to greening, which can affect the environmental situation in the region and optimize the process of using natural resources.\nIn many countries, comprehensive environmental policies have begun to take shape, and the state has implemented them in all spheres of economic activity. SMEs usually take the lead in embarking on risky and promising innovation, as they tend to be naturally agile and can quickly adjust to business environment changes. The more prominent the company is, the more it is subject to legislation. Therefore, small- and medium-sized businesses should become primary agents in the creation of an ecological or green sector of the economy, as SMESmust identify new business ideas as a recipe for their success.\nCompanies are affected by both external and internal factors. Regulatory acts and legislation related to environmental pollution, using renewable energy sources, waste recycling, or implementing socially effective programs are examples of controlling external factors. Companies analyze the additional costs to be incurred and the revenues to be earned from the use or non-use of \u2018\u2018green\u2019\u2019 technologies and production principles. Environmental charges encourage entrepreneurs to reduce harmful emissions to a level where the marginal costs of implementing environmentally friendly technologies will equal ecological taxes and fees. Tax incentives for investments in nature protection can be a stimulating external factor in the greening of businesses. The task of environmental benefits is to stimulate companies to make their technological processes less harmful. Many countries have mechanisms to encourage entrepreneurs to use greening approaches actively. Among them are energy tax benefits and reduced electricity rates when using renewable energy sources; compensation for the purchase of solar panels and other equipment for using solar energy; a floating transport tax that considers the amount of carbon dioxide emissions per kilometer; and differentiated environmental tax rates depending on energy efficiency.\nIn addition, for small businesses, awareness of their customers\u2019 attitudes toward the company\u2019s activities is crucial; enterprises need to know who their customers are and how much they value the company\u2019s \u2018\u2018greenness\u2019\u2019. The zero-waste and eco-friendly product movement has recently become\npopular; therefore, clients can choose companies that use green technologies and reflect their own life principles. In global practice, the eco-business is becoming more competitive and in demand because consumers have begun to prefer environmentally friendly and high-quality products. The green industry aims not only to generate income from producing environmentally friendly products and providing environmental services but also to preserve the environment and conserve natural resources. The last two to five years have witnessed many changes. Several sustainable business models that are both lucrative and environmentally friendly are already available. These business models are based on the CE, sharing economy, and resource recovery, and regard the product as a service. Some examples of businesses with a broad environmental focus are eco-education, landscaping territories considering their ecological characteristics, using alternative energy sources, manufacturing resource-saving equipment, green construction, and eco-tourism [39].\nThe SME owner\u2019s sense of social responsibility is an example of the internal factors that affect the employment of environmental practices. If the owner\u2019s principles include an interest in reducing the negative environmental impact, then external economic instruments would be of additional influence. Conversely, if the owner\u2019s principles differ, prevailing green laws and increased punitive taxes would be an external incentive for running a green business. SMEs have comparatively fewer inflexible enterprise-level practices, so less time and resources are required to become more eco-friendly. Many SMEs work naturally with lean practices as they are resource-limited; however, this does not directly mean their practices are eco-friendly. It means that many SMEs will likely produce less waste and emissions per person working in the company.\nOne theoretical gap in the current studies of the environmental activities of SMEs is the need to understand better the success factors of environmental performance among these firms. While there is a growing body of research on the drivers of environmental practices of SMEs and the barriers that prevent them from doing so, less is known about the successful factors that lead SMEs to adopt environmentally sustainable practices [12], [22], [34], [40], [41].\nAnother gap is the lack of attention to the social dimensions of sustainability. While many studies have focused on the environmental dimensions of sustainability in the context of SMEs [30], [42], relatively little attention has been paid to the social dimensions of sustainability, such as the impacts of SMEs on local communities and the well-being of workers. This is an important theoretical gap, as SMEs can have significant social impacts, and addressing these impacts is crucial to achieving sustainable development. Some studies have suggested that SMEs are less likely than larger firms to adopt environmentally sustainable practices due to factors such as limited resources, lack of knowledge, fewer possibilities to collaborate with research units like Universities, and the perception that environmental initiatives are not a priority for their business [43], [44]. However, other studies have shown\nVOLUME 11, 2023 56903\nthat SMEs can be highly motivated to adopt environmentally sustainable practices, especially when they are linked to financial benefits, such as cost savings or increased market opportunities, and can be fast in developing new and fresh digitalization-based solutions for sustainability [5], [9], [45].\nThere is limited focus on the role of networks and collaborations: SMEs often operate close to one another and may have the opportunity to collaborate on sustainability initiatives. However, there has been relatively little research on the role of networks and collaborations in promoting sustainability among SMEs. Understanding how networks and collaborations can facilitate sustainability initiatives among SMEs could be an important area for future research and can share resources for thriving innovation.\nTo address these theoretical gaps, future research could focus on exploring the success factors of environmental performance among SMEs. Study the role of the social dimensions of sustainability and the values and beliefs of business owners and managers. This research could help to identify effective models for environmentally sustainable practices among SMEs and could contribute to the development of more targeted and effective policies and programs to support sustainable development in the SME context.\nIn this study, we tried to systemize current knowledge about environmental activities and practices in SMEs and to identify current trends and the most promising areas of the development of environmental activities in the SME context.\nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a systematic mapping study (SMS), following the established guidelines and procedures proposed by [46] and [47]. An SMS helps get a comprehensive overview of a particular research topic, presents an unbiased assessment of the current literature, identifies research gaps, and collects evidence for future research [48], [49]. Research using SMS methodology is used primarily for exploration, obtaining general information about a topic and its conceptual understanding; it does not focus on narrower issues and includes top-level descriptions and analyses of existing research. The following is the rationale for this study:\n1) Clarification of the topic as presented in published literature. 2) Identification of critical characteristics or factors related to the topic being studied. 3) Study of research methodology (designs used, methods, techniques, software) in the context of SMEs and environmental activities. 4) Identification and analysis of the gaps in existing scientific knowledge to plan further scientific research effectively. 5) Preparation for a future systematic review.\nThe SMS eliminates researcher-bias, as it is reproducible, increases reliability, and is devoid of a priori assumptions. The general steps taken in conducting the SMS in this\nstudy are presented in Figure 2. To reduce the possibility of researcher-bias, the steps described in the review process [49] were followed in stages: (1) analyze the need for an SMS, (2) choose the data sources to be used, (3) create search string(s) based on the research objectives and questions, (4) define research inclusion/exclusion, i.e., selection criteria, (5) perform study selection, and (6) perform data extraction and synthesis. The process was conducted in three stages (Fig. 2): planning (steps 1, 2, and 3), execution (steps 4, 5, and 6), and reporting the findings. The following sections describe these stages and our actions in detail.\nA. NEED FOR THE SMS There is a twofold purpose of the SMS. First, we aimed to find recent trends and patterns in environmental practices. Second, we intended for this study to have practical implications for SMEs by answering questions like \u2018\u2018What are the current examples of successful SMEs in environmental practices, particularly waste and recycling management?\u2019\u2019 We explored the patterns and trends in the environmental activities of small and medium businesses by analyzing the results of recent studies.\nResearch questions were compiled to narrow the focus of the SMS to an acceptable size. The systematic research aims to explore the examples of successful environmental practices by SMEs based on the following research question: \u2018\u2018What are the current models of successful environmental practices employed by SMEs, particularly in waste and recycling management?\u2019\u2019 The main research question has been divided into detailed sub-research questions:\n1) RQ1: What types of environmental practices exist in SMEs that contribute to the research area? 2) RQ2: Which are the successful countries involved in waste management and recycling for SMEs? 3) RQ3: What are the successful models for SMEs\u2019 environmental activities and practices? 4) RQ4: What industries contribute and participate the most in environmental activities?\nThe rationale for researching successful practices/approaches is to discover studies that discuss successful environmental methods, eco-innovations, and sustainable approaches in SMEs. The terms \u2018\u2018Waste\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Recycling\u2019\u2019 management were used to narrow the search to all papers related to waste and recycling practices.\n56904 VOLUME 11, 2023\nB. DATA SOURCES AND SEARCH STRINGS Five databases, ACM, IEEE, Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science, were covered in this SMS. The databases were chosen to ensure the liability and credibility of the search results and to obtain a wide variety of papers, as advised by Kitchenham\u2019s guidelines [49]. The current SMEs\u2019 waste management and environmental activities topic is multidisciplinary,which is present in different sources, like business, sustainability and environmental journals and conferences. Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science are three of the most popular and valued multidisciplinary citation databases. IEEE focuses on technical literature in engineering and technology, and the ACM database covers computing and information technology. Before inclusion, we searched IEEE and ACM with trial keywords to ensure the relevant results for the study. The identified filters utilized were: English only, with publication years from 2015 to 2022. We decided to use 2015 as a filter due to the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with 17 SDGs issued by the UN General Assembly in 2015 [23].We assumed and noticed an increase in research on environmental enterprises and sustainability after that year. We also limited the searches to peer-reviewed articles, conference proceedings, books, and book chapters. Grey literature was excluded from the search to focus on peer review academic content.\nThe keywords were created based on three dimensions: business size, sustainability, and outcomes.We broadened the search strategies and terms to identify asmany eligible studies as possible. Search terms were modified with an asterisk (a wildcard symbol that broadens a search by findingwords with the same beginning) and combined with Boolean operators. The keywords between dimensions were connected with the AND operator to include all three dimensions, and the OR operator was used inside each dimension to embrace more relevant studies. The applied search is presented in Table 1.\nThe search was performed using the Title, Abstract, and Keywords fields or the closest to these. Each database uses these differently. For example, the search field in IEEE is called Metadata (including the abstract, index terms, and bibliographic citation data such as the document title, publication title, and author); in Web of Science, the field is named Topic. Scopus and ScienceDirect have separate search fields \u2018\u2018TITLE-ABS-KEY\u2019\u2019; in ACM, we have a combined search for title, abstract, and keywords in the command line.\nWe faced a small challenge with the Science Direct database. The maximum permissible is eight operators, but we have nine in our final keywords string. After that, we used the string for two searches with different last keywords in each search.We checked the search results for duplicates in the two searches and combined the results from all the databases. The final search strings and search fields are presented in Table 2. The summarized outcome of the database searches (2872 papers) was imported to the reference management software to conduct a duplicate search. Duplicates were removed, and the results were exported to Excel for the inclusion and exclusion process. Two thousand one hundred sixty-five papers were identified after duplicate removal for further analysis.\nVOLUME 11, 2023 56905\nC. INCLUSION/EXCLUSION OF THE STUDIES, ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, AND QUALITY ASSESSMENT Two researchers performed the inclusion/exclusion process. The article selection process was organized in two rounds: 1st excluding irrelevant papers based on titles and 2nd inclusion of eligible papers based on abstracts.\nResearch papers that met at least one of the criteria below were excluded (automatic exclusion):\n\u2022 Duplicate study or research from different sources. \u2022 (Short) Papers of a few pages (up to 4). \u2022 Papers are written in a language other than English. \u2022 Papers written before 2015.\nResearch papers whose titles met at least one of the criteria below were excluded (manual exclusion):\n\u2022 No mention of SME \u2022 No mention of sustainability \u2022 No mention of recycling/recycle/waste\nFirst, the researchers skimmed the papers by title, searching for SMEs with success in environmental activities, particularly waste management/recycling. The business should directly relate to the recycling/waste management sector or present operating sustainable environmental activities. The article was not included in the abstracts skimming stage if there was no mention of SME, waste/environment/recycle, or sustainability in the title. The search result was evaluated for inclusion or exclusion by considering the title, summary, and keywords. After skimming titles, we had 311 papers for the second step, and 1756 results were excluded as they did not match the selection criteria. All discrepancies were resolved by consensus between the researchers.\nIn the second step, the papers\u2019 abstracts were read and scanned for inclusion criteria. Papers were excluded if there was no mention of SME, waste, environment, recycling, or the main topic was not environmental. For example, was sustainability the mainstay or just a side effect of economic growth? Technical papers that explained tool creation were also excluded. Such publications were excluded as they did not fit the final goal of the study. Finally, 138 articles were included for the full text read and data extraction.\nTo evaluate the quality of the final selected studies and extract the desired data, the researchers performed a quality assurance evaluation based on the research goal, a question, and access to the full text. Thus, 17 papers and book sections were eliminated from the study. Elimination criteria were the following:\n\u2022 They did not directly contribute to the research questions of the review and mapping study and did not cover the SME context, just an overview, and discussion of possible activities. \u2022 Three items were about green supply chain management, not particularly in the SME context. \u2022 The full text was not available for reading.\nFig. 3 presents the number of studies excluded in each criteria and the final number of primary studies included.\nAppendix B Table 7 presents all the papers included in the SMS (n = 127).\nD. DATA EXTRACTION STRATEGY Properties extracted from the full text helped find research gaps and identify possible future studies. Research questions were answered using extracted properties. Moreover, the bibliographic data of the papers (such as pages, document type, citations, and journal) were analyzed to reveal the most popular journals for publication and the appropriate number of pages with examples of proper articles. The gathered elements, as connected to each research question, are explained in Table 3 below.\nResults and environmental sustainability methods were used only for the analysis, not for visualization.\nE. DATA EXTRACTION PROCESS Two researchers conducted data extraction from 127 papers based on the extraction categories and recorded their findings in a Microsoft Excel table for analysis, conclusions, and visualization of the results.\nMicrosoft Excel software was used for data analysis. The following diagrams were created to answer the research questions and are presented in section III: 1) Articles published by year in the context of SMEs and\nenvironmental activities 2) Journals that publish the most on SMEs and environ-\nmental activities 3) The countries that publish the most on SMEs and envi-\nronmental activities 4) Document types about SMEs and environmental activ-\nities that are most published 5) Most cited authors, countries, documents, and journals 6) Research of SMEs by sector 7) Top types of the paper/sectors 8) Research methods and sample sizes that are used in the\npapers on SMEs and environmental activities\n56906 VOLUME 11, 2023\nTABLE 3.

QUALITY ASSURANCE AND THREATS TO VALIDITY The PRISMA guide has been utilized for searching and selecting the papers for the study. PRISMA is an evidence-based approach showing the minimum items required for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. An international group of clinical researchers developed a PRISMA publication guide to improve the quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses publications. The final version of the PRISMA checklist contains 27 items that help researchers in their work. The current study followed the PRISMA checklist for the field\u2019s search, selection, and data analysis stages [50].\nIII. RESULTS AND FINDINGS RQ1:What are the current examples in studies of successful environmental practices by small and medium enterprises, particularly in waste and recycling management?\nThis first research question aims to identify the existing studies that explicitly considered successful environmental practices by SMEs, particularly in waste and recycling management, and review their contribution to the field. These studies are listed below in Table 7, identified by the key used in Appendix B. The contributions of the chosen primary studies are outlined in Table 4. Overall, there are 20 papers with the successful practical implementation of environmental practices.\nAccording to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF), circular products and materials are categorized as biological and technical [51]. Three basic principles of circular economy (CE) proposed by the EMF are: regenerating natural systems, designing waste and pollution elimination systems, and keeping products and materials in use [52]. The basic principles of CE are presented in Figure 4.\nVOLUME 11, 2023 56907\nTABLE 4. The synthesis of main ideas, based on SMS finding. TABLE 4. (Continued.) The synthesis of main ideas, based on SMS finding.\nIn the presented articles, various applications of CE principles and the usage of biological/technical materials are apparent. For example, four studies [53], [54], [55], [56] propose using biomass and biofuel as energy sources, and\n56908 VOLUME 11, 2023\nseveral other articles give solid approaches for recycling and reusing [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62]. However, in the current sample, there are neither sustainable examples of eco-farming or eco-collection of resources nor how such resources can be regenerated. From a technical perspective, there are no cases of sharing resources or materials and using remanufacturing effectively. We recommend further research for successful examples of environmental activities by SMEs in these areas. Researchers should explore eco-farming or eco-collection of resources and resource regeneration methods, opportunities, and challenges in the context of SMEs and large companies. The sharing of resources or materials and effective use of remanufacturing approaches by SMEs are additional subjects for future research. Figure 13 in Appendix C presents CE activities\u2019 biological and technical divisions.\nWith the target to map the research focus areas of the found articles and generalize the current big picture of research in this context, a weighted word cloud (see Fig. 5) was generated based on the primary studies\u2019 abstracts. This was made with WordCloud [72], which uses a stemming algorithm to filter textual input. Observing the density of terms, the most frequently used are recycling, waste, SME, innovation, enterprises, concrete, challenges, and environmental.\nThese papers presented environmental activities that would benefit future practitioners. SMEs can use their resources to\nproduce energy from biogas or biomass or recycle packaging and tires for new materials and re-usage. We focused on successful examples of environmental activities by SMEs, covering the biological and technical aspects of their approaches. These can serve as recommendations and opportunities for small and medium businesses to contribute to the CE and impact resource savings. Cost reductions could be a beneficial outcome of these environmental activities.\nIn Figure 6, eight popular models of environmental activities by SMEs are presented across the literature.\n1) Eco-design and sustainable production: This can include reducing the use of raw materials, improving energy and resource efficiency, and using recyclable or biodegradable materials. 2) Cleaner production and waste reduction: This can include implementing recycling programs, reducing the use of toxic substances, and improving energy efficiency. 3) Sustainable supply chain management. This can include working with suppliers to reduce waste, improve energy efficiency, and use sustainable materials. 4) Following environmental certification and reporting: Certification schemes such as ISO 14001 and EMAS provide a framework for environmental management, while reporting frameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) provide guidelines for reporting on environmental performance. 5) Energy efficiency and renewable energy: Involves implementing energy-efficient technologies, such as LED lighting or smart energy management systems, and using renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power.\nVOLUME 11, 2023 56909\n6) Circular economy: This can include implementing closed-loop systems, such as product take-back schemes or material reuse programs and designing products for disassembly and recycling. 7) Green marketing and communication: Involves green marketing strategies, such as eco-labeling or green branding, and communicating about environmental performance through sustainability reporting or social media. 8) Environmental collaboration and partnerships: Involves participating in industry associations, working with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) on environmental programs, or partnering with government agencies on environmental initiatives.\nThese eight environmental practices and activities can be implemented separately or combined in the SMEs for a successful joint outcome.\nA. ARTICLES PUBLISHED BY YEAR IN THE CONTEXT OF SMEs AND ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVITIES We analyzed the number of studies published each year, as illustrated in Fig. 7.\nThe results show that from 2015, publications related to SMEs and environmental practices grew at a constant and stable rate, except in 2017. The low number of publications in 2017 is quite interesting. It is also worth noting that this mapping study conducted early in 2022 shows a slight decrease for 2022. However, the total number of papers in 2022 should be higher or equal to the previous year. Our search yielded the most studies in 2021, which can be attributed to environmental improvements made during COVID-19, as a lot of production was stalled. This allowed the researchers to direct attention to the suitability question.\nB. JOURNALS THAT PUBLISH THE MOST ON SMEs AND ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVITIES Further, we investigated the publication titles of the papers. Well-known journals in the field, such as the Journal of Cleaner Production, Business Strategy and the Environment, and the Journal of Environmental Management with more than one publication each, are listed in Table 6 in the Appendix. The published journals were studied to understand\nthe dissemination opportunities of our results and similar works. The table is presented in Appendix A.\nC. DOCUMENT TYPE THAT IS PUBLISHED THE MOST ABOUT SMEs AND ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVITIES In Figure 8, chronological distribution based on publication type is presented. Most of the studied papers are journal papers due to the narrow topic and directly connecting with the goals and aims of the journals. Conference papers are in second place. Book and book chapters are minors.\nD. MOST CITED COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE SMEs ARE LOCATED As shown in Fig. 9, the most cited countries are India, Brazil, and Europe (no specific country, just the general region),\n56910 VOLUME 11, 2023\nwhich means environmental activities are gaining popularity. Fig. 9 illustrates the 44 cited countries in this sample. India has the highest number, with a total of 438. India is one of the\nVOLUME 11, 2023 56911\ncountries that generate the most articles and has a large rural economy with a high potential for sustainable technologies. In second place is Brazil, with 288 citations. Europe has 192 citations highlighting the importance of the topic.\nRQ2: Which are the successful countries involved in waste management and recycling for SMEs?\nE. THE REGIONS THAT OPERATE THE MOST ON ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVITIES IN SMEs Fig. 10 shows ten generalized regions where SMEs are located and research was conducted. Europe\u2019s lead seems to indicate the widest attention to environmental activities there. Southeast Asia is 2nd, with Indonesia and Malaysia having successful examples of environmental activities by SMEs.\nRQ4: What industries contribute and participate the most in environmental activities?\nF. DIVISION OF SMEs BY SECTOR Figure 11 presents the division of papers by industry. The most significant industry with environmental activities is manufacturing. Production is generally associated with a negative impact on the environment. Some industries are distin-\nguished by the significant harm they cause to nature, while others are somewhat less.Manufacturing can be singled out as the industry that causes tremendous environmental damage. According tomodern trends, the sector includes three types of economic activity: mining; manufacturing; production, and distribution of electricity, gas, and water. Enterprises of all three of these sectors cause damage to the environment to one degree or another. Therefore, manufacturing is one of the highest polluting industries, and it is not surprising that it is also the first to implement environmental activities.\n56912 VOLUME 11, 2023\nThe most damage is caused to nature by industrial enterprises producing chemical and metallurgical products, coke, and petroleum products, rubber and plastic products, electricity, and oil and gas. There is an inverse relationship between the level of industrial development of a city or region and its environmental situation. Cities with powerful industrial complexes are characterized by intense pollution of atmospheric air, water bodies, and territory.\nRQ3: What are successful models for environmental activities and practices in SMEs?\nWith 44 out of 127 (34.7%) documents relating to challenges/barriers/drivers for environmental activities, these emerged as the main topics of research (Fig. 12). Another topic of interest in environmental activities is the overview of sustainable environmental activities; with proposals for environmental models and activities for SMEs, representing 20% and 19% of the publications, respectively. The other positions are associated with waste reduction, management, and resource savings. As future research topics, examples of real-world waste management practices or applications of resource savings can be studied. Research can be narrowed to a specific size of enterprise or industry.\nIV. CONCLUSION The impact of SMEs on the environment is significant, even though it may not be immediately apparent. The benefits of environmentally friendly production are becoming increasingly evident to more enterprises: raw and other materials costs are reducing, and with the observance of environmental standards, customer relations and the images of companies are improving. Despite this, however, the capabilities of such enterprises are often limited, and not all businesses understand the competitive advantages that good environmental practices can bring.\nIncreased attention to the problems of preserving the environment, reducing the negative impact of economic activity, and developing a \u2018\u2018green\u2019\u2019 economy has become a global\ntrend.Modern businesses should interrelate economic, social, and environmental achievements in a sustainable manner. Businesses and the government should play a leading role in this. The government can motivate businesses to cause less harm to the environment.\nThe study discusses examples of environmental practices and their role and position in SMEs. The papers considered demonstrate the relevance and potential of this topic. In many articles, the concepts of \u2018\u2018green\u2019\u2019 economy, ecoinnovation, and environmental practices are defined; barriers, drivers, and challenges in the transition to environmentally oriented activities of enterprises are identified; and the experience and directions of eco-business are considered. We have identified eight environmental practices: eco-design, cleaner production, sustainable supply chain management, following environmental certification and reporting, energy efficiency and renewable energy, circular economy, green marketing and communication, environmental collaboration, and partnerships. We have found the most popular examples of successful models for SMEs\u2019 environmental activities and practices. The most effective approach for a particular SME will depend on its specific context and goals.\nThe societal implications of the existing solutions provided by environmental practices lend a better understanding of their usage in SMEs. This study tries to increase awareness and heighten future interest in development and research on this topic. The practical implications of the paper allow businesses to study and learn about the various opportunities available for sustainable economic, social, and environmental development. SME owners can use our findings as motivation and ideas on how to be more sustainable and cause less harm to the environment. The theoretical implications lie in exploring and structuring existing knowledge on environmental practices in the SME context and finding research gaps and future research topics.\nThe current trends and most promising areas of environmental development activities and sustainable business practices in the SME context are identified in this study. The data were collected using the PRISMA methodology, and the Kitchenham methodology was used for the SMS. Five databases were used and searched for the study.\nAs the number of papers increases each year, the issue of sustainable development for SMEs is being pursued widely. Companies have adjusted their business strategies according to environmental considerations and sustainable goals.\nDuring our research, we identified several focus areas in the development of environmental activities in SMEs; it is necessary and exciting to focus the attention and effort of the professional community on their practical applications for SMEs, startups, and academics. We identify the following promising areas for the development of eco-innovation and environmental activities in research:\n\u2022 Biogas, biofuel, and biomass usage for energy production.\nVOLUME 11, 2023 56913\n\u2022 Recycling and reusing packaging, tires, and other materials to create new components. \u2022 Concrete recycling. \u2022 Eco-designing. \u2022 Reuse of wastewater. \u2022 Recycling of printed circuits.\nAs future research topics, examples of real-world waste management practices or applications of resource savings can be studied. Research can be narrowed to a specific size of enterprise or industry. We recommend researching successful examples of SMEs in these areas. The fact that these examples were not presented in our sample does not mean that they do not exist in academia or as real-world examples; it only means they did not meet the criteria of our keyword search. Future research can relate to eco-farming or eco-collection of resources or their regeneration; opportunities, challenges, and success and failure factors can also be studied. Sharing resources or materials and using remanufacturing approaches effectively in SMEs are other topics for future research.\nIt is possible to identify a small group of countries and regions that are the main environmental SME actors; this would serve as segmentation for researchers to know where they can visit and gather information easily. The research\ndevelopment shows that countries like India, Brazil, and several European countries have many eco-innovations.\nThus, examples of functioning green businesses are presented in the literature, but they are still in their infancy. It should be remembered that the rapid development of any business, including the environment, is possible, provided it is economically efficient and sustainable. The task of the government is to support eco-business more actively and effectively, which will further facilitate the transition of enterprises and companies to a green economy. In conclusion, we outline themain advantages and disadvantages of environmental entrepreneurship. This would help identify the most promising actions for public authorities in activating green businesses.\nIn the presented literature, we highlighted exciting findings on what can be done to increase initiatives on environmental practices [73], [74], [75], [76], [77], [78]. The company can request an audit from a qualified agency to examine and identify bottlenecks and possible eco-innovations [77]. It is necessary to raise awareness among companies about the optimization and reduction of water, heat, and electricity consumption. There are successful implementations of available technologies for wastewater treatment and atmospheric emissions [64], [74], [79]. The companymay try to reduce the total\n56914 VOLUME 11, 2023\namount of waste generated during production and the amount of waste transferred to landfills for disposal [73], [75]. For example, this can be achieved by returning scrap and waste to production and recycling it. In several industries, recycling more than 80% of waste, such as plastic, wood, cullet, tetra packs, and organic waste is already possible. The government can help with preferential taxes for environmentally friendly SMEs. We recommend that future researchers explore this topic, as it benefits SMEs, entrepreneurs, and business owners. The advantages and disadvantages are presented in Table 5.\nLimitations of our research\n\u2022 Limited to publications in English from 2015- 2022. \u2022 Focusing only on academic publications: journals, con-\nference proceedings, and peer-reviewed books.\nA. FUTURE RESEARCH WORK We have identified some research gaps. Many papers concentrated on the challenges, barriers, and benefits of environmental activities, and some focused on proposed models\nof environmental actions for more sustainable companies. We recommend that future researchers focus on the successful examples of waste management and recycling innovation that SMEs have produced and integrate them for future use. Their implications and scalability can be examined.\nAs one of the goals of the current research was to provide future topics and study areas, we propose several research questions which can be explored in the context of environmental activities; these may aid future research that explores the role of both environmental practices and eco-innovations of SMEs. It can help SMEs reach their environmental missions and produce new ideas by combing existing solutions or collaborating with other companies.\nThese research questions can be a starting point for future research.\nRQ1:What environmental practices exist in SMEs that can be produced or implemented? RQ2: How do SMEs in waste management and recycling become successful? RQ3: What are the successful models for SMEs\u2019 environmental activities and practices? RQ4: What are the challenges, barriers, and benefits of environmental and eco-innovations in SMEs? RQ5: What are the failure factors for the implementation of eco-innovation? RQ6: How can a company combine existing biological and technical techniques to become circular?\nAs future research topics, examples of real-world waste management practices or applications of resource savings can be studied. Research can be narrowed to a specific size of enterprise or industry. We advise researching successful examples of SMEs in these areas. The fact that these examples were not presented in our sample does not mean that they do not exist in academia or as real-world examples; it means they did not meet the criteria of our keyword search. Another suggestion can be the study of themodel\u2019s synergy of environmental practices: what is the level and amount of environmental practices that should be applied in the company for total zero-waste production and sustainable development? Future research can relate to eco-farming or eco-collection of resources or their regeneration, opportunities, and challenges in this field, and success and failure factors can be studied. Sharing resources or materials and using remanufacturing approaches effectively in SMEs are other opportunities for future research.\nAPPENDIX A See Table 6.\nAPPENDIX B See Table 7.\nAPPENDIX C See Figure 13.\nREFERENCES [1] (Aug. 2021).
