 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading this paper on detecting spammer groups in e-commerce:

1. Develop new methods to identify loosely coupled spammer groups where members do not need to review every target product. The paper notes that existing FIM-based methods work better for tightly coupled groups. New approaches could be developed to detect loosely coupled groups more effectively.

2. Incorporate additional node attributes beyond behavioral features to further improve detection. The paper extracts some behavioral attributes, but other attributes like text features of reviews could provide additional signals. Exploring how to best incorporate diverse attributes could enhance performance.

3. Develop adaptive methods to handle evolving spammer behaviors over time. As spammers change strategies, the detection methods may need to adapt. Research on continual learning or concept drift could allow the methods to adjust to new spam patterns. 

4. Explore how to best combine supervised and unsupervised learning for spammer group detection. The paper presents an unsupervised approach, but labeled data could help further boost performance. Studying hybrid semi-supervised architectures could be promising.

5. Investigate how to scale up the methods to handle massive e-commerce sites with billions of reviews. The computational complexity and memory requirements to analyze such large graphs present challenges. Research on efficient implementations, parallelization, approximation algorithms or other techniques to improve scalability would be valuable.
