Using a novel edge-centric structural connectivity (eSC)\nanalysis from individualized single-subject cortical thickness networks, we aimed\nto examine eSC and network measures in severe (> 70%) asymptomatic carotid\nstenosis (SACS).\nMethods: Twenty-four SACS patients and 24 demographically- and comorbidities-matched controls were included, and structural MRI and\nmultidomain cognitive data were acquired. Individual eSC was estimated via\nthe Manhattan distances of pairwise cortical thickness histograms.\nResults: In the eSC analysis, SACS patients showed longer interhemispheric but shorter intrahemispheric Manhattan distances seeding from left lateral temporal\nregions; in network analysis the SACS patients had a decreased system segregation\nparalleling with white matter hyperintensity burden and recall memory. Further\nnetwork-based statistic analysis identified several eSC and subgraph features\ncentred around the Perisylvian regions that predicted silent lesion load and\ncognitive tests.\nConclusion: We conclude that SACS exhibits abnormal eSC and a lessoptimized trade-off between physical cost and network segregation, providing\na reference and perspective for identifying high-risk individuals.\nKEYWORDS\ncortical thickness, structural covariance, brain network, vascular cognitive impairment, graph theory\n1.

As such, cognitive status has been suggested as an indicator of disease progression and efficacy monitoring in these patients (Lattanzi et\u00a0 al., 2018). However, the neuroanatomical basis underlying cognitive impairment remains largely unclear.\nNeuroimaging studies have revealed notable structural alterations in asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Morphological analyses, for example, reveal asymmetrical (Gao et\u00a0al., 2021b) and stenosis-ipsilateral dominated gray matter (GM) atrophies (Avelar et\u00a0al., 2015), cortical thinning in the Perisylvian regions (Gao et\u00a0al., 2021a), and accelerated aging changes (Alhusaini et\u00a0al., 2018). Lesion mapping has reported prominent subcortical microinfarcts and white matter hyperintensity (WMH; Kandiah et\u00a0al., 2014; van Veluw et\u00a0 al., 2017). Structural imaging also identifies reduced white matter integrity and fiber density in such patients (Cheng et\u00a0al., 1970; Meng et\u00a0al., 2017; Gao et\u00a0al., 2019). Moreover, these patients are reported to show compromised hemodynamics (Silvestrini et\u00a0 al., 2009; Balucani et\u00a0 al., 2012), glymphatic dysfunction and enlarged perivascular spaces (Liu et\u00a0al., 2021). These lines of evidence suggest that extensive morphological changes have occurred in these patients, and morphometric network analysis based upon may provide rich information for understanding the neuroanatomical basis of cognitive impairment and predicting long-term risks.\nA multivariate methodology is the structural covariance network analysis (Alexander-Bloch et\u00a0al., 2013), which assumes that morphological measures [e.g., cortical thickness (CT)] of one brain region and another structurally and functionally connected one co-vary, forming different communities. These co-variations are underpinned by gene co-expression (RomeroGarcia et\u00a0 al., 2018), systematically change across lifespan development (Montembeault et\u00a0al., 2012; Kuo et\u00a0al., 2020), and are sensitive to the early stages of neuropsychiatric diseases (e.g., Coppen et\u00a0 al., 2016; Liu et\u00a0 al., 2019; Qing et\u00a0 al., 2021). For example, normal aging is characterized by a decrease in GM covariance connectivity in higher-order associative regions, especially those involved in the semantic, executive control, and default mode functions (Montembeault et\u00a0al., 2012). However, most previous studies of morphometric networks are based on group-level covariance across subjects. While this analysis can reveal brain network architecture, it cannot derive individuallevel network measures, which greatly reduces its clinical utility for individual patients.\nConsequently, individualized single-subject morphometric network analyses are emerging as a new area of research (Tijms et\u00a0al., 2012; Li et\u00a0al., 2017; Xue et\u00a0al., 2022). They can provide measures similar to those derived from functional connectivity with functional MRI or structural connectivity with diffusion MRI tractography, holding promise for clinical settings. The construction of individual morphometric network is generally by estimating the interregional/areal relationships, e.g., probability distributions, distances, and similarities, of morphological features (e.g., GM volume, CT, cortical gyrification, sulcus depth, and\ncortical complexity; Tijms et\u00a0al., 2012; Wang et\u00a0al., 2016; Li et\u00a0al., 2017; Raamana and Strother, 2018). The pairwise estimates of morphological features are termed edges in network analysis. The edges and their inter-edge relationships are called edge-centered brain connectivity, which is a new direction in human brain connectomics.\nAsymptomatic carotid stenosis is a condition characterized by potential chronic hypoperfusion, microembolism, and hemodynamic burdens caused by internal carotid stenosis (Cheng et\u00a0al., 1970; Marshall et\u00a0al., 2017; Wang et\u00a0al., 2017). This condition primarily affects the Perisylvian cortical reorganization and topographically involves somatosensory/motor, semantic, silent processing, and frontoparietal systems, as well as cognitive functions such as processing speed and semantic memory (Avelar et\u00a0al., 2015; Gao et\u00a0al., 2019; Nickel et\u00a0al., 2019; Gao et\u00a0al., 2021b). Thus, an investigation of the morphometric network may provide us with a better understanding of the neuroanatomical basis of cognitive impairment in carotid stenosis. Network edges derived from interareal histogram weights form rich connectivity information, and promote the identification of the edges that closely relate to cognitive impairment (Raamana et\u00a0al., 2015; Wang et\u00a0al., 2016, 2018; Raamana and Strother, 2020; Li et\u00a0al., 2021; Peng et\u00a0al., 2022). However, it is unknown to what extent asymptomatic carotid stenosis may affect the edges and network architecture that are closely associated with cognitive impairment and serve as potential imaging markers.\nIn this study, we\u00a0used a novel individual approach to construct single-subject CT networks and contrasted unilateral (>70%) severe asymptomatic carotid stenosis (SACS) patients with demographically and comorbidities-matched healthy controls (HC). We\u00a0estimated edge-centric structural connectivity (eSC) derived from the pairwise Manhattan distances of regional CT histograms. We\u00a0expected that the SACS showed abnormal eSC in the Perisylvian and language-related regions and that this eSC was associated with cognitive impairment in SACS patients. Furthermore, large-scale structural networks reconstructed from the eSC would exhibit lower network segregation and efficiency globally."

The residual distribution was transformed into a histogram by binning it into N = 100 equally spaced bins. The histogram counts were then normalized by for k = 1: N, where hi is the node i histogram (Figure\u00a01, step\u00a02). This approach computes the pairwise edge-weight for the two nodes i and j, regardless of the number of vertices in the two nodes (Figure\u00a01, step\u00a02). For a detailed method description, please see the original articles (Raamana et\u00a0al., 2015; Raamana and Strother, 2020).

This analysis showed that the SACS patients had longer interhemispheric but shorter intrahemispheric Manhattan distances seeding from left lateral temporal regions, corresponding to lower interhemispheric but higher intrahemispheric connectivity. Further network analysis showed that the SACS patients had decreased system segregation paralleling with WMH burden and recall memory. Lastly, we\u00a0applied a recently developed NBS approach to get feature weights for eSC, and subgraph features that predicted WMH load and cognitive tests. These results showed that SACS had disrupted structural connectivity, altered eSC measured by\nManhattan distances, and pronounced lower system segregation. Further, NBS analysis yielded good feature classification performance. These findings suggest that subject-wise eSC has the potential to identify high-risk individuals while also providing insights into the morphological connectivity basis of cognitive impairment and accelerated aging in advanced asymptomatic carotid stenosis.\nThis study identified that patients with SACS exhibited altered pairwise CT co-vary patterns with increased interhemispheric but decreased intrahemispheric Manhattan distances seeding from the left lateral temporal regions. This result is consistent with prior reports on atrophy and dysconnectivity in the same regions (e.g., Cheng et\u00a0al., 1970; Lin et\u00a0al., 2014; Avelar et\u00a0al., 2015; Marshall et\u00a0al., 2017; Tani et\u00a0al., 2018; Nickel et\u00a0al., 2019; Gao et\u00a0al., 2021b), and also generally consistent with previous reports using fMRI\nA\nG H\nE F\nB C D\nFIGURE\u00a03 Subject-level network using the Desikan-Killiany atlas (68 parcels).

For example, earlier results from resting-state functional connectivity show that SACS has reduced interhemispheric connectivity, especially in the frontoparietal network ipsilateral to stenosis (Cheng et\u00a0al., 1970). Our prior study also has identified lower interhemispheric functional connectivity located in the Perisylvian regions, spanning across somatomotor, salience, and dorsal attention networks (Gao et\u00a0 al., 2019). We\u00a0 interpret this finding as altered morphological co-variations dominated by the lateral temporal regions. Notably, the SACS exhibited shorter Manhattan distances and thus a higher eSC. This is unusual since neurodegenerative diseases are often associated with decreased connectivity globally. On the one hand, this\nphenomenon may reflect pairwise synchronized/co-vary atrophy patterns, as much of previous evidence has shown that these regions have thinner cortex in SACS (Avelar et\u00a0al., 2015; Marshall et\u00a0 al., 2017; Nickel et\u00a0 al., 2019; Gao et\u00a0 al., 2021a), and this synchronized shrinkage could lead to an increased similarity. This speculation requires further verification through computational modeling. On the other hand, this may reflect compensation in the preclinical stage of the disease, as many neurodegenerative diseases have shown a compensatory increase in the early stages.\nIt is also possible that in SACS patients, the long-range connections that maintain interhemispheric interactions and support advanced cognitive function are impaired, while the relatively short-range intrahemispheric connections that are essential for functional specification are enhanced.

Group average connectivity matrices for SACS patients (A,C) and healthy controls (B,D) with 15 mm and 25 mm smoothing kernels using the HCP-MMP atlas are shown. The colorbar shows standard Manhattan distances, with smaller values reflecting greater structural connectivity and vice versa. Subgraphs (E,F) show between-group differences on network connectivity with 15 mm and 25 mm smoothing kernels, respectively, which could be\u00a0visualized as graphs. (G,H) The colorbar shows t values for the group statistics on the edges, with a positive t-value representing that the SACS patients had a longer Manhattan distance and thus a lower structural connectivity on the edge, and vice versa. LH, left hemisphere; RH, right hemisphere.\nFrontiers in Aging Neuroscience 09 frontiersin.org\nstudies have established that interhemispheric integration and intrahemispheric specialization are important underpinnings of an individual\u2019s higher cognitive abilities (e.g., Buckner and Krienen, 2013).\nAnother novel finding of our study is that the SACS patients exhibited decreased system segregation and comparable system integration as compared to the controls. Human functional imaging has shown that system segregation decreases with normal aging (Chan et\u00a0 al., 2014) and supports cognitive resilience in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Ewers et\u00a0al., 2021), and this reduction can be\u00a0improved through visual speed processing training (Chen et\u00a0al., 2021). This suggests that the community structure of SACS blurs system and network boundaries, which may reflect a compensatory\nmechanism under the condition of chronic hypoperfusion and compromised hemodynamics. Such phenomenology has also been suggested as decreased within-system and increased betweensystem functional connectivity in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Vipin et\u00a0al., 2018).\nLimitations. First, as a small sample study, we\u00a0 thus repeated the analyses using different smoothing kernels and atlases to overcome the potential bias; future large-sample studies are needed to address this issue and promote deep learning-based prediction of high-risk individuals, with emphasis on dementia and stroke, to inform clinical decisions for surgical intervention in such patients.
