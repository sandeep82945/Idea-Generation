    "abstractText": "In our recent work, we introduced the reduced unified continuum formulation for vascular fluid-structure interaction (FSI) and demonstrated enhanced solver accuracy, scalability, and performance compared to conventional approaches. We further verified the formulation against Womersley\u2019s deformable wall theory. In this study, we assessed its performance in a compliant patient-specific aortic model by leveraging 3D printing, 2D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 4D-flow MRI to extract high-resolution anatomical and hemodynamic information from an in vitro flow circuit. To accurately reflect experimental conditions, we additionally enabled in-plane vascular motion at each inlet and outlet, and implemented viscoelastic external tissue support and vascular tissue prestressing. Validation of our formulation is achieved through close quantitative agreement in pressures, lumen area changes, pulse wave velocity, and early systolic velocities, as well as qualitative agreement in late systolic flow structures. Our validated suite of FSI techniques can be used to investigate vascular disease initiation, progression, and treatment at a computational cost on the same order as that of rigid-walled simulations. This study is the first to validate a cardiovascular FSI formulation against an in vitro flow circuit involving a compliant vascular phantom of complex patient-specific anatomy.

Phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI), which encodes absolute velocities of coherent blood flow, was previously limited to unidirectional velocity encoding in 2D. Recent developments in 4D-flow MRI, however, have enabled threedirectional velocity encoding over 3D volumes, paving the way for increasingly detailed numerical validation.\nWe recently developed a unified continuum formulation for FSI25 that not only recovers important continuum models including viscous fluids and visco-hyperelatic solids,24 but is also well-behaved in both compressible and fully incompressible regimes. This unified continuum formulation was then simplified to a reduced unified continuum (RUC) formulation via consideration of three modeling assumptions for vascular FSI, namely the infinitesimal strain, thin-walled, and membrane assumptions.21 The RUC formulation, which achieves monolithic coupling of the fluid and solid subproblems in an Eulerian frame, was found to offer computational cost as low as 1.3 times that of rigid-walled CFD simulations.22 While the coupled momentum method (CMM)7 similarly embeds a linear elastic membrane into an Eulerian fluid subproblem, key theoretical and numerical differences exist with regard to the fluid-solid coupling, spatiotemporal discretization, vascular wall dynamics, and linear solver technology.21 In our verification against Womersley\u2019s deformable wall theory, we demonstrated notable agreement between analytical and numerical solutions. Given the overlap in assumptions in the RUC formulation and Womersley\u2019s deformable wall theory, assessing the validity of our adopted assumptions in settings of practical clinical interest, particularly with complex anatomical geometries, remains necessary.\nCFD simulations of the cardiovascular system have commonly been validated against in vivo velocities from either 2D cine PC-MRI6,17,28 or 4D-flow MRI.2,31,32 Numerical validation can alternatively be performed against in vitro MRI of experimental flow phantoms embedded in benchtop circuits to assess effects of various parameters, including boundary conditions, anatomical geometries, and wall mechanical properties, on the flow behavior and solver performance. Constrained by limitations in fabrication methods, these in vitro experiments have until recently employed rigid flow phantoms constructed from photoreactive resin.4,14,19,35 Alastruey et al.1 and Kung et al.18 were among the first to perform in vitro FSI validation on compliant flow phantoms of idealized geometries that were fabricated from silicone dip-spin coating or hand-painting. Numerous other flow circuits with compliant flow phantoms fabricated from silicone, polyurethane, or latex15,16,34 have also been engineered to investigate cardiovascular hemodynamics in health and disease and to further assess the performance of implantable devices. Recent advances in 3D printing techniques,13 including PolyJet and stereolithography, now enable rapid, repeatable printing of compliant patient-specific flow phantoms from novel photopolymers5,11,36 without the need for laborious procedures. Importantly, mechanical characterization of these cost-effective phantoms can be performed to inform FSI validation studies. Nonetheless, to our knowledge, no previous studies have validated cardiovascular FSI formulations against in vitro flow circuits involving compliant patient-specific vascular phantoms.\nIn a previously published study,36 we demonstrated the use of novel compliant 3D printing to fabricate patient-specific aortic phantoms of three stiffness values, which were then embedded in an MRI-compatible flow circuit under physiological hemodynamic conditions. In our current study, we focus only on the most compliant phantom and assess the RUC formulation by drawing direct comparisons to the experimentally measured three-component 3D velocities, flow rates, pressures, luminal area changes, and pulse wave velocity. Effects of selected boundary conditions are also assessed."

While \u0393W has conventionally been modeled as a stress-free surface, a Robin boundary condition was recently introduced to represent the viscoelastic behavior of tissues and organs surrounding the modeled vasculature.30 To model the surrounding gel block, we imposed \u03c3sns = \u2212ksus \u2212 csvf on \u0393W , where the spring constant ks = 0 g/(cm2\u00b7 s2) and damping constant cs = 3.0\u00d7105 g/(cm2\u00b7 s) were determined to best match experimental relative luminal area changes.\nFurthermore, most vascular FSI simulations have enforced clamping, or zero displacements, at all inlets and outlets of the solid subdomain, yet the phantom inlet and outlets here were not experimentally clamped, given the 2-cm extensions beyond the domain of interest. More recently, studies have relaxed this displacement constraint to enable either purely radial motion8 or in-plane motion.3 We similarly enabled in-plane motion on all caps by applying inclined \u2018roller\u2019 boundary conditions on the associated displacements as follows,\nus \u00b7 ns = 0 and \u03c3sns \u2212 (\u03c3sns \u00b7 ns)ns = 0, on \u0393icap for i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 5.\nTo constrain degrees of freedom in skew directions ,10 a skew coordinate system was established for each cap using ns and two orthonormal vectors tangential to \u0393icap. All associated equations were solved in the skew coordinate system, and solutions for the associated degrees of freedom were subsequently rotated back into the global coordinate system.\nThe boundary of the fluid subdomain can be decomposed as \u2202\u2126f = \u0393I\u222a \u22c3ng k=1 \u0393 k g\u222a \u22c3nh l=1 \u0393 l h, where boundary surface \u0393kg represents the k-th surface prescribed with Dirichlet data g k(x, t) as vf = gk(x, t), and \u0393lh represents the l-th surface prescribed with Neumann data \u2212P l(t) as \u03c3fnf = \u2212P l(t)nf . Here, we imposed Dirichlet conditions on inlet and the three neck artery outlets (BCA, LCA, and LSA) and a Neumann condition on outlet, yielding ng = 4 and nh = 1. In the remainder of this work, we eliminate the superscript l for the Neumann boundary to simplify notation.\nTo prescribe time-varying velocity fields on inlet, we leveraged the three-component velocities from 4D-flow MRI rather than the unidirectional, through-plane velocities from 2D cine PC-MRI. Given the different coordinate systems across the various imaging sequences,\n4D-flow and 2D cine GRE scans were first registered to the computational mesh via rigid coherent point drift. Time-varying inlet lumen contours from 2D cine GRE were then used to mask the 4D-flow velocities. To map these deforming luminal domains onto the stationary inlet surface mesh, a piecewise linear transformation was defined to map each experimental lumen contour to the boundary of the inlet mesh. The same piecewise linear transformation was then applied to the luminal domain of the masked inlet velocity profile, and the resulting velocity profile was interpolated onto the inlet mesh with a Gaussian kernel. Linear interpolation of the velocity fields was performed between consecutive temporal frames.\nDespite use of the gel block to ensure repeatable phantom positioning, deformations were experimentally introduced, given the small size of the neck arteries and compliance of the phantom. The rigid registrations therefore yielded visible (though small) misalignment of the neck arteries, precluding assignment of 4D-flow velocity fields on the three corresponding outlets (BCA, LCA, LSA). Experimental b1, b2, and b3 flow rates integrated from 2D cine PC-MRI velocities were therefore respectively prescribed at BCA, LCA, and LSA with idealized parabolic velocity profiles. Lastly, experimental outlet transducer pressures were used to generate the functional form of P (t) prescribed at outlet."

To reduce the size of the associated linear system and enable effective block preconditioning,21,27 we leveraged the special block structure of the fully consistent tangent matrix to develop a segregated algorithm. Our block preconditioner was previously shown to exhibit enhanced robustness and scalability as compared to alternative preconditioners in applications spanning hyperelasticity, viscous fluids, and FSI.21,26\nTo reflect the steady configuration captured by the 3D SPGR scan, we initialized our simulation in the following steps. A rigid-walled CFD simulation was first performed with a prescribed steady inflow of 71.2 mL/s to determine the corresponding fluid traction hf . Resistance boundary conditions were prescribed at all four outlets, tuned to achieve the experimental outflow distribution (18.0% BCA, 4.9% LCA, 3.8% LSA, 73.3% outlet) and mean experimental pressures (inlet 56 mm Hg, outlet 55 mm Hg). The resulting hf was then used in the fixed-point algorithm to determine \u03c30. With the vascular wall appropriately prestressed, we performed a steady-state FSI simulation prescribed with steady diastolic boundary conditions corresponding to t = 0, from which we initialized our pulsatile simulation. Three cardiac cycles were simulated to ensure convergence to a limit cycle, and only the third cycle was analyzed.\nComparisons between experimental and simulated velocity fields were made possible by sampling the 4D-flow velocity fields onto the computational mesh. With the same TTF approach discussed in Section 2.4, we computed the numerical PWV using simulated pressure waveforms at the same 50 normal slices. We note that in contrast to the use of flow waveforms to compute the experimental PWV, pressure waveforms were instead used to compute the numerical PWV due to their uniformity in waveform shape."

            "text": "In addition to the simulation outlined above, which we refer to as Sim-4DMRI (Figure 2), we also alternatively prescribed an idealized parabolic inlet velocity profile in a separate simulation termed Sim-Idealized. Experimental flow rates integrated from the masked 4Dflow velocities were thus prescribed at inlet with parabolic velocity profiles, and all other aspects of Sim-Idealized were kept consistent with Sim-4DMRI.\nWe further performed three supplemental simulations to compare the effects of the inplane and clamped boundary conditions on \u0393iring and assess the effect of reducing the viscous damping constant cs applied over \u0393I . Noting that Sim-4DMRI was performed with in-plane motion and cs = 3.0 \u00d7 105 g/(cm2\u00b7 s), the supplemental simulations enabled investigation of the following four combinations: (i) in-plane motion, cs = 3.0 \u00d7 105 (Sim-4DMRI ); (ii) in-plane motion, cs = 3.0\u00d7103; (iii) clamped, cs = 3.0\u00d7105; and (iv) clamped, cs = 3.0\u00d7103. Experimental 4D-flow velocity profiles were prescribed at inlet across these four simulations. Removing the viscous damping altogether would have allowed us to decouple the effects of these boundary conditions on \u0393iring and \u0393I , but we have found that for practical meshes of reasonable cost, enabling in-plane motion without prescribing any external tissue support results in arbitrary translation of \u0393iring nodes due to inherent mesh asymmetry."

            "text": "Comparisons between simulated and experimentally measured volumetric flow rates, pressures, and relative areas over the cardiac cycle are shown in Figures 3 and 4. Whereas the experimental flow rates plotted for inlet and outlet were computed from 4D-flow velocities, those plotted for BCA, LCA, and LSA were computed from 2D cine PC-MRI velocities, given the 4D-flow MRI registration discrepancies discussed in Section 2.6.2. We focus first on Sim-4DMRI and Sim-Idealized. As expected, flow rate discrepancies from the experimental results were observed only for outlet, the only cap for which a Neumann condition was prescribed. While exact mass conservation would not be expected either experimentally or numerically, the experimental flow rates exhibited a mean loss of 5.01 mL/s from the inflow (77.8 mL/s); by comparison, Sim-4DMRI and Sim-Idealized exhibited mean gains of only 0.0671 mL/s and 0.0765 mL/s, respectively, from the inflow (77.8 mL/s).\nRelative to the experimental inlet pressure, the corresponding Sim-4DMRI and SimIdealized pressures were lower in systole and higher in diastole, suggesting larger numerical compliance. The experimental outlet pressure was numerically prescribed, and no experimental pressure measurements were available for BCA, LCA, or LSA. This increased numerical compliance, which was further supported by the larger simulated relative area changes in 4 of the 6 landmarks along the aortic arch, can be attributed to the adopted linear elasticity with a tangential Young\u2019s modulus taken at the mean pressure. Closer agreement would be expected with future extensions to nonlinear models.\nTurning our attention to the three supplemental simulations, we observed that the simulation with the same damping constant cs = 3 \u00d7 105 g/(cm2\u00b7 s) as Sim-4DMRI but with clamped wall boundary rings yielded flow rates, pressures, and relative areas that were practically indistinguishable from those of Sim-4DMRI, with the exception of the constant inlet and outlet areas. On the other hand, the two simulations with the reduced cs = 3 \u00d7 103 g/(cm2\u00b7 s) exhibited significant oscillations in all non-prescribed flow rates and pressures and all areas at non-clamped landmarks.\nWe investigated the experimental 4D-flow MRI and simulated velocity profiles (Figure 5) at 6 evenly spaced temporal frames spanning systole (annotated in Figures 3 and 4), beginning with acceleration at t = 0.12 s, peak systole from t = 0.20 to t = 0.28 s, and ending with deceleration from t = 0.36 to t = 0.52 s. All six 2D scan landmarks along the aortic arch were included. Focusing only on Sim-4DMRI, we observed close agreement in the profile shapes in all frames leading up to peak systole albeit the higher simulated velocities in the descending aorta, as expected given the higher simulated flow rates seen in Figure 3. Ascending aortic velocity magnitudes in the deceleration phase, however, revealed that the simulation captured stronger forward flow as well as stronger reverse flow along the exterior curve of the ascending aorta. These differences were similarly observed from sagittal velocity fields at the same temporal frames (Figure 6), noting again that no comparisons could be drawn for the misaligned neck arteries. Barring the higher velocity magnitudes in the descending aorta at t = 0.12 s, our simulation almost exactly reproduced the experimental velocity fields leading up to peak systole. We also observed close agreement during fluid deceleration with regard to the shape and angle of the jet, including its curved tip near the brachiocephalic artery take-off.\nTo comprehend the 3D flow behavior, we turned our attention to streamlines (Figure\n7). In both Sim-4DMRI and the experiment, flow near the inlet reversed along the proximal aortic wall at the onset of fluid deceleration following peak systole at t = 0.28 s. This reversed flow continued to grow in strength until formation of a vortex at t = 0.40 s along the left lateral wall. Despite the significantly lower velocity magnitudes in the 4D-flow data, we observed notable agreement in the vortex shape and location in the final two highlighted frames. We do, however, note the presence of three additional smaller vortices in Sim-4DMRI that were absent from the experiment: one along the right lateral wall (formed at t = 0.46s), and two on either side of the sagittal plane (formed at t = 0.50 s). Whereas the single vortex in the experimental data persisted until the end of the cardiac cycle, the presence of multiple interacting vortices in Sim-4DMRI caused the four initial vortex structures to progressively break up into increasing numbers of smaller vortices.\nIn contrast to these Sim-4DMRI results, velocity fields from Sim-Idealized failed to capture key salient features of the experimental fields, including the shape and angle of the jet. Furthermore, the ascending aortic velocity magnitudes were much too low throughout systole, the onset of flow reversal was delayed until t = 0.40 s, and vortex formation was similarly delayed until the end of systole at t = 0.56 s.\nIn computing the experimental PWV, the presence of numerous outlier TTF points yielded 698 cm/s with an LSE regression but 578 cm/s with a RANSAC regression. By comparison, LSE and RANSAC regressions for Sim-4DMRI yielded similar PWV estimates of 624 cm/s and 630 cm/s, respectively, both with equally high coefficients of determination R2 indicating excellent fits (Figure 8). Importantly, our simulated PWV values fell within the experimental bounds."

            "text": "Our study represents the first to validate a cardiovascular FSI formulation against an in vitro flow circuit involving a compliant patient-specific vascular phantom. Novel aspects spanning both the experimental and numerical fronts include (i) rapid, cost-effective, and repeatable PolyJet photopolymerization of a compliant aortic model; (ii) mechanical characterization of the phantom for FSI parameter estimation; (iii) the use of multiple MRI sequences to achieve high-resolution anatomical and hemodynamic data; (iv) in-plane motion of inlet and outlet surfaces to circumvent nonphysiological clamping; (v) external tissue support to model the embedding gel block; and (vi) vascular wall prestressing to reflect imaging under experimental steady flow conditions.\nWhen Moireau et al.30 first proposed external tissue support, they also found it effective at eliminating rapid wall oscillations observed with CMM,7 which have long been hypothesized to arise from clamping-induced wave reflections. Nonetheless, Figures 3 and 4 clearly indicate that even with in-plane motion of \u0393iring nodes, viscous damping beyond some threshold level was necessary to suppress oscillations in our study. To better understand the source of these oscillations, we additionally replaced the flow rate and pressure boundary conditions at the outlets with Windkessel models; no oscillations were observed even when clamping \u0393iring nodes in the absence of external tissue support. Prescribing the resulting inlet, BCA, LCA, and LSA flow rates and outlet pressure from this Windkessel simulation in a subsequent simulation also produced no oscillations. Together, these observations sug-\ngested that the oscillations requiring damping in our study were driven by the assignment of experimental waveforms.\nDespite discrepancies in the velocity fields during deceleration, our simulation captured key salient features of the 4D-flow MRI data, including the (i) region and trajectory of reverse flow following peak systole, (ii) shape and angle of the jet, and (iii) shape and location of the primary vortex. On the other hand, Sim-Idealized exhibited poor agreement with the 4D-flow MRI data in numerous aspects including the ascending aortic velocity magnitudes, shape and angle of the jet, duration of flow reversal, and time of vortex formation. These discrepancies highlight the importance of assigning non-idealized inlet velocity profiles.\nPrevious in vitro and in vivo validation studies4,19,32 have similarly reported larger velocity field discrepancies during deceleration, with simulations exhibiting complex secondary flow features that were absent from the 4D-flow MRI data. These discrepancies in complex flow structures can partially be explained by the many issues inherent to 4D-flow MRI. In particular, despite the many corrections applied to the acquired velocity fields either during or following image reconstruction to reduce phase offsets, the resulting 4D-flow MRI velocity fields are not completely divergence-free, signaling a lack of conservation of mass. Solenoidal filtering and related divergence-free methods33 could be explored in the future. Furthermore, image acquisition in k-space over extended durations of time yields images that are temporally averaged over tens of cardiac cycles, and furthermore averaged within each temporal bin corresponding to the temporal resolution (0.02 s here). Boundary voxels capturing both the fluid and surrounding wall are also subject to the partial volume effect.9 The combined effect of partial voluming and temporal averaging over a deforming domain presents challenges for deriving accurate boundary conditions reflective of the in vivo or in vitro conditions to be prescribed in simulations. Additional sources of error existed in our study, as indicated by the lack of conservation of mass, absence of periodicity in luminal areas, and the large number of outliers yielding regression-dependent PWV estimates. Moreover, the misalignment of the neck arteries hindered our ability to assign non-idealized velocity profiles at the corresponding BCA, LCA, and LSA outlets. The resulting parabolic profiles and limited unidirectional velocity encoding of 2D cine PC-MRI likely introduced discrepancies that were propagated into the flow domain.\nOverall, close agreement in pressures, lumen area changes, pulse wave velocity, early systolic velocities, and late systolic flow structures validates our numerical methodology, including the RUC formulation, in-plane deformation at model inlets and outlets, viscoelastic external tissue support, and vascular tissue prestressing. Together, our suite of computationally efficient FSI techniques offers a platform for investigating vascular disease initiation, progression, and treatment."
