            "text": "The expansion of the Universe is currently accelerating. This is well-supported by many observations but the underlying theory remains obscure. If general relativity is valid on cosmological scales, a dark energy that has negative pressure is thought to be responsible for the accelerated cosmological expansion. In the well-known spatially-flat \u039bCDM model (Peebles 1984), dark energy is a cosmological constant \u039b and contributes \u223c 70% of the current cosmological energy budget (see, e.g. Farooq et al. 2017; Scolnic et al. 2018; Planck Collaboration 2020; eBOSS Collaboration 2021). However, potential observational discrepancies (see, e.g. Di Valentino et al. 2021b; Perivolaropoulos & Skara 2021; Abdalla et al. 2022) motivate consideration of other cosmological models besides flat \u039bCDM. In our analyses here we also allow for non-zero spatial curvature1 as well as dark energy dynamics.\nMany observations have been used to compare the goodness of fit of cosmological models and determine cosmological parameter constraints. These include CMB anisotropy data (see, e.g. Planck Collaboration 2020) that largely probe the high-redshift, z \u223c 1100, Universe, as well as lower-z cos-\n?

In Cao et al. (2021b), by using H(z) + BAO + SN data (SN refers to Pantheon and DES-3yr SN Ia data, discussed in Sec. 3 below), we estimated summary values of the current nonrelativistic matter density parameter \u2126m0 = 0.294 \u00b1 0.020 and the Hubble constant H0 = 68.8\u00b11.8 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121. In Cao et al. (2022b), by using H(z) + BAO + SN + QSO-AS + H iiG data, summary values of \u2126m0 = 0.293 \u00b1 0.021 and H0 = 69.7\u00b11.2 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 were obtained. Compared to our earlier analysis, the addition of QSO-AS and H iiG data results in similar constraints on \u2126m0 with a slightly larger 1\u03c3 uncertainty and more restrictive (1\u03c3 uncertainty reduced by 50%) H0 constraints, with a higher central value of H0 (0.42\u03c3 higher).\nIn our analysis here we improve on our earlier work by more correctly accounting for the neutrinos. We also use updated BAO and H(z) data and now also include Mg ii QSO and A118 GRB data.5 Here the joint analyses of H(z) + BAO + SN + QSO-AS + H iiG +Mg ii QSO + A118 data provide model-independent values of \u2126m0 = 0.295 \u00b1 0.017 and H0 = 69.7\u00b11.2 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121. Our H0 measurement is in better agreement with the median statistics H0 estimate of Chen & Ratra (2011) than with the local expansion rate H0 estimate of Riess et al. (2021). Flat \u039bCDM is favored the most, but mild dark energy dynamics or a little spatial curvature energy density is not ruled out. Although here we use updated H(z) and BAO data, and add Mg ii QSO and A118 data, the constraint on H0 is identical to that of Cao et al. (2022b),6 whereas the new constraint on \u2126m0 is more restrictive (1\u03c3 uncertainty reduced by \u223c 24%) and \u223c 0.15\u03c3 higher.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we introduce the cosmological models/parametrizations used in our analyses. In Sec. 3 we describe the data sets used in our analyses, with the methods we use summarized in Sec. 4.\n3 We do not use these data in this paper since the latest Lusso et al. (2020) QSO flux compilation assumes a UV\u2013X-ray correlation model that is invalid above z \u223c 1.5 \u2212 1.7 (Khadka & Ratra 2021, 2022). 4 Only a subset containing 118 Amati-correlated GRBs are suitable for cosmological purposes (Khadka & Ratra 2020c; Cao et al. 2021a; Khadka et al. 2021c), and these are the Amati-correlated GRBs we use in our analyses here. 5 We also examined constraints from mutually consistent Platinum + A101 GRB data used in Cao et al. (2022d) and jointly analyzed them with QSO-AS, H iiG, and Mg ii QSO data. Cosmological constraints from the joint QSO-AS + H iiG + Mg ii QSO + Platinum + A101 data are similar to those from the QSO-AS + H iiG +Mg ii QSO + A118 data, so we decided to perform further analyses with the latter that constrain fewer non-cosmological parameters. 6 Mg ii QSO and A118 data do not have the power to constrain H0 and updated H(z) and BAO data we use here provide similar constraints to those from older BAO and H(z) data.\nWe discuss our cosmological parameter constraints results in Sec. 5 and summarize our conclusions in Sec. 6."

            "text": "In this paper, we use various combinations of data to constrain cosmological model parameters in six spatially-flat and non-flat dark energy cosmological models.7 Using a number of different models allows us to determine which results are less dependent on the model used to derive them. The expansion rate, E(z,p), as a function of redshift z and the cosmological parameters p in a given cosmological model, is defined as E(z,p) \u2261 H(z,p)/H0, with H(z,p) being the Hubble parameter. The expansion rate is used to compute cosmological-parameter-dependent predictions in the cosmological models we study. In these cosmological models, as in Cao et al. (2022d), we assume one massive and two massless neutrino species, with the effective number of relativistic neutrino species Neff = 3.046 and the total neutrino mass \u2211 m\u03bd = 0.06 eV. Therefore, here the current value of the non-relativistic neutrino physical energy density parameter, \u2126\u03bdh2 = \u2211 m\u03bd/(93.14 eV), is not a free parameter, and along with the current values of the observationally-constrained baryonic (\u2126bh2) and cold dark matter (\u2126ch2) physical energy density parameters, \u2126m0 is derived as \u2126m0 = (\u2126\u03bdh2 + \u2126bh2 + \u2126ch2)/h2, where h is the Hubble constant in units of 100 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121.\nIn the \u039bCDM models the expansion rate function is E(z,p) = \u221a \u2126m0 (1 + z) 3 + \u2126k0 (1 + z) 2 + \u2126\u039b, (1)\nwhere \u2126\u039b = 1 \u2212 \u2126m0 \u2212 \u2126k0 is the cosmological constant dark energy density parameter, \u2126k0 is the current value of the spatial curvature energy density parameter, and \u2126k0 = 0 implies flat spatial hypersurfaces. The cosmological parameters p = {H0,\u2126bh2,\u2126ch2} and p = {H0,\u2126bh2,\u2126ch2,\u2126k0} are constrained in the flat and non-flat \u039bCDM models, respectively. Note that whenH0 and \u2126bh2 are fixed in analyses of some of the data sets we use, p change accordingly.\nIn the XCDM parametrizations,\nE(z,p) = \u221a \u2126m0 (1 + z) 3 + \u2126k0 (1 + z) 2 + \u2126X0 (1 + z) 3(1+wX),\n(2)\nwhere wX is the X-fluid equation of state parameter, and \u2126X0 = 1 \u2212 \u2126m0 \u2212 \u2126k0 is the current value of the Xfluid dynamical dark energy density parameter. The cosmological parameters p = {H0,\u2126bh2,\u2126ch2, wX} and p = {H0,\u2126bh2,\u2126ch2, wX,\u2126k0} are constrained in the flat and non-flat XCDM parametrizations, respectively.

The unmarginalized best-fitting parameter values, as well as the corresponding \u22122 lnLmax, AIC, BIC, DIC, \u2206AIC, \u2206BIC, and \u2206DIC values, for all models and data combinations, are listed in Table 4, whereas the marginalized posterior mean parameter values and uncertainties (\u00b11\u03c3 error bars or 2\u03c3 limits), for all models and data combinations, are listed in\nTable 5.11\nIn the non-flat \u039bCDM and flat and non-flat \u03c6CDM models, Mg ii QSO + A118 data mildly favor currently decelerating cosmological expansion, which is most likely caused by the choice of fixed \u2126b and H0 values. All other data combinations more favor currently accelerating cosmological expansion.\n5.1 Constraints from H(z), BAO, and SN Ia data\nThe updatedH(z) + BAO results derived here are quite similar to the H(z) + BAO results given in Cao et al. (2022d), so we do not discuss them in detail. H(z) + BAO + SN is a more important data combination, so here we discuss these constraints in more detail. While the computation of the H(z) + BAO + SN results reported in Cao et al. (2022b) neglected the late-time contribution of non-relativistic neutrinos, in this paper, where we account for the contributions of one massive and two massless neutrino species, we find very similar constraints.\nThe constraints from H(z) + BAO + SN data on \u2126m0 range from a low of 0.287\u00b1 0.017 (flat \u03c6CDM) to a high of 0.304+0.014\u22120.015 (flat \u039bCDM), with a difference of 0.75\u03c3.\nThe H0 constraints range from a low of 68.29 \u00b1 1.78 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (flat \u03c6CDM) to a high of 69.04 \u00b1 1.77 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (flat \u039bCDM), with a difference of 0.30\u03c3, which are 0.09\u03c3 (flat \u03c6CDM) and 0.31\u03c3 (flat \u039bCDM) higher than the median statistics estimate of H0 = 68 \u00b1 2.8 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (Chen & Ratra 2011), and 2.23\u03c3 (flat \u03c6CDM) and 1.89\u03c3 (flat \u039bCDM) lower than the local Hubble constant measurement of H0 = 73.2\u00b11.3 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (Riess et al. 2021).\nThe constraints on \u2126k0 are 0.040\u00b10.070, \u22120.001\u00b10.098, and \u22120.038+0.071\u22120.085 for non-flat \u039bCDM, XCDM, and \u03c6CDM, respectively. Although non-flat hypersurfaces are mildly favored, flat hypersurfaces are well within 1\u03c3.\nThere is a slight preference for dark energy dynamics. For flat (non-flat) XCDM, wX = \u22120.941 \u00b1 0.064 (wX = \u22120.948+0.098\u22120.068), with central values being 0.92\u03c3 (0.76\u03c3) higher than wX = \u22121; and for flat (non-flat) \u03c6CDM, \u03b1 = 0.324+0.122\u22120.264 (\u03b1 = 0.382 +0.151 \u22120.299), with central values being 1.23\u03c3 (1.28\u03c3) away from \u03b1 = 0.\n11 We use python package getdist (Lewis 2019) to analyze the samples and generate the plots.\n5.2 Constraints from QSO-AS, H iiG, Mg ii QSO, A118, and Platinum + A101 data\nGiven our improved treatment of neutrinos in this paper, compared to our earlier analyses, we have reanalyzed data we had previously studied.\nAs shown in Cao et al. (2022b), QSO-AS data alone do not deal well with H0, so an unbounded prior range for H0 makes it hard for the computation to converge and results in an unreasonably high H0 value and so an unreasonably low lm value. However, we expect constraints on the other cosmological parameters consistent with those given in Cao et al. (2022b). Constraints from H iiG data are consistent with what are given in Cao et al. (2022b). Constraints from Mg ii QSO data are consistent with those described in Khadka et al. (2021b) while those from A118 and Platinum + A101 data are consistent with those in Cao et al. (2022d). We find that cosmological parameter constraints from those four data sets are mutually consistent so they can be used to do joint analyses. As expected, cosmological parameter constraints from the joint QSO-AS + H iiG data and Mg ii QSO + A118 data are indeed mutually consistent, as seen in Tables 4 and 5. We do not discuss these results in detail since there are no significant changes compared to those derived in our earlier analyses. We consider the joint analyses results of QSO-AS + H iiG + Mg ii QSO + A118 data to be more useful and discuss these in more detail next.12\nThe constraints from QSO-AS + H iiG + Mg ii QSO + A118 data on \u2126m0 range from a low of 0.175+0.075\u22120.081 (flat \u03c6CDM) to a high of 0.314+0.051\u22120.044 (flat XCDM), with a difference of 1.60\u03c3. Following the pattern of H iiG data, the \u2126m0 difference is relatively large.\nThe H0 constraints range from a low of 70.38 \u00b1 1.84 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (non-flat \u03c6CDM) to a high of 73.14+2.14\u22122.48 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (flat XCDM), with a difference of 0.89\u03c3, which are 0.71\u03c3 (non-flat \u03c6CDM) and 1.37\u03c3 (flat XCDM) higher than the median statistics estimate of H0 = 68\u00b1 2.8 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (Chen & Ratra 2011), and 1.25\u03c3 (non-flat \u03c6CDM) and 0.02\u03c3 (flat XCDM) lower than the local Hubble constant measurement of H0 = 73.2\u00b11.3 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (Riess et al. 2021).\nThe constraints on \u2126k0 are \u22120.139+0.116\u22120.228, 0.054 +0.227 \u22120.238, and 0.044+0.104\u22120.256 for non-flat \u039bCDM, XCDM, and \u03c6CDM, respectively. As opposed to H(z) + BAO + SN results, non-flat \u039bCDM mildly favors closed hypersurfaces, whereas non-flat XCDM and non-flat \u03c6CDM mildly favor open hypersurfaces. However, flat hypersurfaces are well within 1\u03c3.\nThere are mild preferences for dark energy dynamics. For flat (non-flat) XCDM, wX = \u22121.836+0.804\u22120.419 (wX = \u22122.042+1.295\u22120.451), with central values being 1.04\u03c3 (0.80\u03c3) lower than wX = \u22121; and for flat (non-flat) \u03c6CDM, \u03b1 < 6.756 (\u03b1 < 7.239), with \u03b1 = 0 being within 1\u03c3.\n12 We note that cosmological parameter constraints from Platinum, A101, and Platinum + A101 data are also consistent with those from QSO-AS, H iiG, and Mg ii QSO data, so we also investigate the joint QSO-AS + H iiG + Mg ii QSO + Platinum + A101 (QHPMAP101) data combination. As seen in Tables 4 and 5, we find no significant differences between the QHPMAP101 cosmological constraints and those from the QSO-AS + H iiG + Mg ii QSO + A118 data combination that contains fewer noncosmological parameters.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201316 (2022)\n5.3 Constraints from H(z) + BAO + SN + QSO-AS + H iiG + Mg ii QSO + A118 (HzBSNQHMA) data\nCosmological parameter constraints from H(z) + BAO + SN data are consistent with those from QSO-AS + H iiG + Mg ii QSO + A118 data. From model to model, there are differences, ranging from \u22120.41\u03c3 (flat XCDM) to 1.45\u03c3 (flat \u03c6CDM), between \u2126m0 constraints from H(z) + BAO + SN data and those from QSO-AS + H iiG + Mg ii QSO + A118 data; and there are differences, ranging from 0.73\u03c3 (nonflat \u03c6CDM) to 1.48\u03c3 (flat XCDM), between H0 constraints from QSO-AS + H iiG + Mg ii QSO + A118 data and those from H(z) + BAO + SN data. For the XCDM parametrizations, H(z) + BAO + SN data slightly prefer non-phantom dark energy dynamics, whereas QSO-AS + H iiG + Mg ii QSO + A118 data prefer phantom dark energy dynamics, however, their differences are within 1\u03c3. As can be seen in the (d) panels of Figs. 1\u20136, the two-dimensional posterior cosmological constraints from H(z) + BAO + SN data and QSO-AS + H iiG +Mg ii QSO + A118 data are significantly more mutually consistent than the less than 1.5\u03c3 differences between the maximum and minimum one-dimensional posterior mean values discussed above. Consequently we can combine these data in a joint HzBSNQHMA data analysis; we discuss the results from this analysis next.\nThe constraints from HzBSNQHMA data on \u2126m0 range from a low of 0.286\u00b10.015 (flat \u03c6CDM) to a high of 0.300\u00b1 0.012 (flat \u039bCDM), with a difference of 0.73\u03c3.\nThe H0 constraints range from a low of 69.50 \u00b1 1.14 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (flat \u03c6CDM) to a high of 69.87 \u00b1 1.13 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (flat \u039bCDM), with a difference of 0.23\u03c3, which are 0.50\u03c3 (flat \u03c6CDM) and 0.62\u03c3 (flat \u039bCDM) higher than the median statistics estimate of H0 = 68 \u00b1 2.8 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (Chen & Ratra 2011), and 2.14\u03c3 (flat \u03c6CDM) and 1.93\u03c3 (flat \u039bCDM) lower than the local Hubble constant measurement of H0 = 73.2\u00b11.3 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (Riess et al. 2021).13\nThe constraints on \u2126k0 are 0.018\u00b10.059, \u22120.009+0.077\u22120.083, and \u22120.040+0.064\u22120.072 for non-flat \u039bCDM, XCDM, and \u03c6CDM, respectively. Following the same pattern as H(z) + BAO + SN data results, flat hypersurfaces are also well within 1\u03c3.\nThere is a slight preference for dark energy dynamics. For flat (non-flat) XCDM, wX = \u22120.959 \u00b1 0.059 (wX = \u22120.959+0.090\u22120.063), with central values being 0.69\u03c3 (0.65\u03c3) higher than wX = \u22121; and for flat (non-flat) \u03c6CDM, \u03b1 = 0.249+0.069\u22120.239 (\u03b1 = 0.316 +0.101 \u22120.292), with central values being 1.04\u03c3 (1.08\u03c3) away from \u03b1 = 0.\n13 Other local determinations of H0 result in somewhat lower central values with somewhat larger error bars (Rigault et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2017; Dhawan et al. 2018; Fern\u00e1ndez Arenas et al. 2018; Breuval et al. 2020; Efstathiou 2020; Khetan et al. 2021; Rameez & Sarkar 2021; Freedman 2021). Our H0 determinations here are consistent with earlier median statistics estimates (Gott et al. 2001; Calabrese et al. 2012) and with other recent H0 determinations (Chen et al. 2017; DES Collaboration 2018; G\u00f3mez-Valent & Amendola 2018; Planck Collaboration 2020; Dom\u00ednguez et al. 2019; Cuceu et al. 2019; Zeng & Yan 2019; Sch\u00f6neberg et al. 2019; Blum et al. 2020; Lyu et al. 2020; Philcox et al. 2020; Birrer et al. 2020; Denzel et al. 2021; Pogosian et al. 2020; Kim et al. 2020; Harvey 2020; Boruah et al. 2021; Zhang & Huang 2021; Lin & Ishak 2021; Wu et al. 2022)."

            "text": "In this paper we use many of the most up-to-date available non-CMB data sets to determine cosmological constraints. We analyze 32 H(z), 12 BAO, 1048 Pantheon SN Ia, 20 binned DES-3yr SN Ia, 120 QSO-AS, 181 H iiG, 78 Mg ii QSO, 118 (101) A118 (A101) GRB, and 50 Platinum GRB measurements and find that the cosmological constraints from each data set are mutually consistent. We find very small differences between cosmological constraints determined from QSO-AS + H iiG + Mg ii QSO + A118 data and those from QSO-AS + H iiG + Mg ii QSO + Platinum + A101 data, so report only the cosmological constraints\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201316 (2022)\nfrom joint H(z) + BAO + SN + QSO-AS + H iiG + Mg ii QSO + A118 (HzBSNQHMA) data.\nThe HzBSNQHMA data provide a fairly restrictive summary value14 of \u2126m0 = 0.295 \u00b1 0.017 that agrees well with many other recent measurements and a fairly restrictive summary value ofH0 = 69.7\u00b11.2 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 that is in better agreement with the result of Chen & Ratra (2011) than with the result of Riess et al. (2021).15 Our H0 measurement here lies in the middle of the flat \u039bCDM model result of Planck Collaboration (2020) and the local expansion rate result of Riess et al. (2021), slightly closer to the former. Based on DIC, the HzBSNQHMA data compilation prefers flat \u039bCDM the most, but does not rule out mild dark energy dynamics or a little spatial curvature energy density (evidence against them is either weak or positive).\nWe hope that in the near future the quality and amount of the types of lower-redshift, non-CMB, data we have used here will improve enough to result in cosmological parameter error bars comparable to those from Planck CMB anisotropy data."
