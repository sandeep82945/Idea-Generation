We aimed to evaluate the impact of applying dead\u2010time correction on the reconstructed SPECT image versus on the acquisition projections before reconstruction. Methods: Data from 16 SPECT/CT acquisitions of a decaying Lu\u2010filled phantom (up to 20.75 GBq) and dual\u2010timepoint SPECT/CT in 14 patients treated with personalised Lu peptide receptor radionuclide therapy were analysed. Dead time was determined based on the acquisition wide\u2010spectrum count rate for each projection and averaged for the entire acquisition. Three dead\u2010time correction methods (DTCMs) were used: the per\u2010projection correction, where each projection was individually corrected before reconstruction (DTCM1, the standard of reference), and two per\u2010volume methods using the average dead\u2010time correction factor of the acquisition applied to all projections before reconstruction (DTCM2) or to the SPECT image after reconstruction (DTCM3). Relative differences in quantification were assessed for various volumes of interest (VOIs) on the phantom and patient SPECT images. In patients, the resulting dosimetry estimates for tissues of interest were also compared between DTCMs. Results: Both per\u2010volume DTCMs (DTCM2 and DTCM3) were found to be equivalent, with VOI count differences not exceeding 0.8%. When comparing the per\u2010volume post\u2010reconstruction DTCM3 versus the per\u2010projection pre\u2010reconstruction DTCM1, dif\u2010 ferences in VOI counts and absorbed dose estimates did not exceed 2%, with very few exceptions. The largest absorbed dose deviation was observed for a kidney at 3.5%. Conclusion: While per\u2010projection dead\u2010time correction appears ideal for QSPECT, post\u2010reconstruction correction is an acceptable alternative that is more practical to implement in the clinics, and that results in minimal deviations in quantitative accuracy and dosimetry estimates, as compared to the per\u2010projection correction.",

            "text": "Quantitative single-photon emission computed tomography (QSPECT) is increasingly used for dosimetry in radiopharmaceutical therapy, for which one of the main radionuclides is currently 177Lu [1]. We and others have shown that QSPECT dosimetry-based personalisation of 177Lu radiopharmaceutical therapy allows to safely escalate activity per cycle and/or cumulative activity during the induction course of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in patients suffering from neuroendocrine tumours, with encouraging preliminary efficacy results [2, 3]. We previously showed that correcting QSPECT for dead time leads to more accurate quantification and dosimetry and becomes critical when high activity is administered and/or when high retention thereof occurs [4].\nOur current dead-time correction method is based on the average observed widespectrum count rate during the SPECT acquisition, from which an average dead-time correction factor (DTCF) is deduced and applied to all voxels on the 3D reconstructed volume [5, 6]. However, the observed count rate varies from projection to projection during the acquisition depending on the activity biodistribution and the patient\u2019s morphology. It has been suggested that per-projection dead-time correction may improve accuracy over per-volume correction [7]. However, per-projection correction requires image manipulation before reconstruction, or the use of customised reconstruction software, which makes this approach less practical and potentially less prone to wider adoption and implementation in clinical practice.\nThis study aimed to compare per-projection versus per-volume dead-time correction methods for QSPECT both in a 177Lu-filled phantom and in patients undergoing personalised PRRT, as well as the impact of these methods on absorbed dose estimates for tissues of interest in patients."

Twenty acquisitions were performed with an initial total 177Lu activity of 20.75\u00a0GBq on the Intevo system. Phantom acquisitions were performed consecutively with only detector 1 activated and with both\ndetectors activated [8]. All acquisitions were performed with a total number of 96 projections (10\u00a0s per projection for the first 13 acquisitions and then 20\u00a0s per projection for the seven remaining; 128 \u00d7 128 matrix; 4.8\u00a0 mm pixel). SPECT acquisitions were followed by low-dose CT acquisitions (110\u00a0kVp, 70\u00a0mAs).\nData of 14 patients enrolled in our prospective clinical trial of personalised PRRT (NCT02754297) were selected to gather a large range of average observed widespectrum count rate (Table\u00a02) [2]. Day-1 QSPECT and Day-3 QSPECT were acquired at 23.3 \u00b1 1.2 and 70.3 \u00b1 0.7\u00a0 h, respectively, following 177Lu-octreotate injection on the Symbia system. Acquisitions were performed with both detectors activated, as described above. The time per projection on Day 1 was either 15 or 20\u00a0s, while it was systematically 20\u00a0s per projection on Day 3."

The bone marrow VOI was semi-automatically defined using the CT image: all voxels with Hounsfield units greater than 100 HU corresponding to L1\u2013L4 vertebras were included.\nThe mean counts in these VOIs were converted to activity concentration using the calibration factor and the DTCF [10]. For dosimetry, a mono-exponential curve fit was applied to the data of each VOI in addition to the averaged values for the kidneys. This allowed to determine the area under the time\u2013activity concentration curve and to deduce the self-absorbed dose for each tissue using the activity concentration dose factor [2]."

These parameters were determined for the Intevo using the full range of quantifiable phantom data obtained. In brief, the observed widespectrum count rate (RWo) is expressed in relationship with the activity (A) times RWo divided by the observed primary count rate (RPo) within the phantom VOI [10]. Data points were then fitted to the following equation derived from the Sorenson\u2019s paralysable model to resolve the calibration factor and dead-time constant using Python 3.6 (Lmfit package, least-square minimization) [8, 10, 11]:\nRWo = CF \u00b7 A \u00b7 RWo\nRPo \u00b7 e\n\u2212CF\u00b7A\u00b7 RWo RPo \u00b7\u03c4\n.\nOnce the dead-time constant is deduced, the DTCF can be determined as the ratio of the expected (RWe) on the observed wide-spectrum count rate, using the original Sorenson\u2019s equation:\nFinally, a look-up table is created, with DTCFs corresponding to ascending RWo values."

Then, the counts of each pixel of the projection\u2019s photopeak, upper, and lower scatter windows were multiplied by that per-projection DTCF before reconstruction. As most SPECT reconstruction software is designed to process only integer counts, it was necessary to round the multiplied counts. Rounding to the closest integer results in inaccurate total number of lost counts injected in the image (e.g. for a DTCF of 1.15, numerous low-activity pixels containing only 1, 2 or 3 counts would be corrected to 1.15, 2.30 and 3.45, respectively, and then systematically rounded down, creating a corrected counts deficit at the image level). Instead, we rounded each pixel counts to the upper integer with a probability equal to its four-digit decimal (using a Python 3.6 script). As this method is not completely deterministic, we performed this process in triplicate, followed by the reconstruction, to evaluate the effect of its randomness component. DTCM1 was considered the reference method, being in principle the most accurate. \u2022 DTCM2\u2014pre-reconstruction, per-volume correction Same method as DTCM1, but with all projections corrected using a single DTCF derived from the average observed wide-spectrum count rate of the entire acquisition. The purpose of DTCM2 was to rule out any bias introduced by performing the per-volume correction before versus after reconstruction, as in DTCM3. \u2022 DTCM3\u2014post-reconstruction, per-volume correction As detailed in [4\u20136] and as currently used in our clinics, the DTCF that is derived from the average observed widespectrum count rate of the entire acquisition is applied to voxel counts after reconstruction. In this case, there is no need to round to integers, as a float number can be applied subsequently to VOI count data, or conveniently inserted as the \u201cRescale Slope\u201d parameter (i.e. DTCF multiplied by calibration factor) of the DICOM header of the reconstructed volume converted to the PT modality, enabling to display Bq/ mL or standardised uptake values directly in the image viewer.\nRWo = RWe \u00b7 e \u2212RWe\u00b7\u03c4\nDTCF = RWe\nRWo ."

In dual-detector mode, the Intevo used for phantom studies saturated at 268 kcps per detector when both detectors were simultaneously exposed to the highest activities (Fig.\u00a01a). Because of the asymmetrical activity distribution in the phantom, it was still\npossible to obtain non-saturated acquisition data up to 9.34\u00a0 GBq (i.e. up to 400\u00a0 kcps on detector 1). When acquiring in single-detector mode (i.e. using only detector 1 over 360\u00b0), the absolute saturation level increased to 592\u00a0kcps, allowing to quantify up to 15.34\u00a0GBq (Fig.\u00a01b). We excluded the two phantom datasets with the lowest activity (0.16 and 0.21\u00a0GBq), for which the quantification inaccuracy exceeded 5% in whole phantom or hot objects (Fig.\u00a02). We thus included ten dual-detector acquisitions from 0.32 to 9.34\u00a0GBq, plus six single-detector acquisitions from 9.36 to 15.33\u00a0GBq for further analysis (n = 16).\nFor the Symbia on which the patient acquisitions were performed, the differential per-detector absolute saturation threshold that we previously observed [8, 10] clearly appeared in two patients on Day 1 after treatment (patients 13 and 14, the latter case illustrated in Fig.\u00a01c). These two acquisitions were excluded from further analysis, resulting in 26 quantifiable acquisitions and 12 valid two-timepoint patients dosimetry studies."

For all VOIs under study, both in phantom and in patients, and for both DTCM1 and DTCM2, the median and the maximum coefficients of variation of the VOI counts were 0.27% and 1.50%, respectively. This maximum coefficient of variation was found for tumours in patients (n = 118), whereas those for all other VOIs did not exceed 0.81%. On this basis, we considered that the randomness with which fractional lost counts are distributed in projections before reconstruction has a negligible impact on quantification.\nIn principle, when using the average DTCF of the acquisition (i.e. based on the average wide-spectrum count rate from all projections), adding lost counts before (i.e. DTCM2) or after (i.e. DTCM3) the reconstruction should be equivalent. For all VOIs under study, both in the phantom and in patients, the median and maximum relative differences in VOI counts between DTCM2 and DTCM3 were 0.06% and \u2212 0.84%, respectively.

            "text": "We have previously shown that dead-time correction is essential for accurate QSPECT in the context of dosimetry-based personalised radiopharmaceutical therapy [4]. Few dead-time correction methods have been proposed for QSPECT [5, 7, 10, 12\u201314]. Most of them use a single DTCF that is applied to the reconstructed image. Here, we observed very small relative differences between per-projection (DTCM1) and per-volume (DTCM3) dead-time correction methods, in terms of both SPECT quantification and absorbed dose estimates during 177Lu radiopharmaceutical therapy. These differences were vastly within 1% and at most a few per cent.\nTo our knowledge, only Cohalan et\u00a0al. have previously performed a comparative study of per-projection versus per-volume dead-time correction based on two SPECT acquisitions of an asymmetrical 2.3\u00a0GBq 99mTc-filled phantom causing ~ 20% dead time (i.e. DTCF\u22481.25) [7]. They reported an average quantification difference of 1.7% between methods among few VOIs. Extrapolating from a figure in their paper, the corresponding median and maximum differences were approximately 1% and 3%, respectively. Their results thus appear consistent with ours, especially in cases with a DTCF larger than 1.1 (right of the dashed line, Fig.\u00a0 3a, b). Interestingly, the authors used a Discovery NM/ CT 670 SPECT/CT system (GE Healthcare), which has a larger dead-time constant than the system considered in this study (1.74 vs. 0.55\u00a0 \u03bcs, respectively) [8]. Such a system may potentially increase the amplitude of dead-time variation between projections for objects or patients with a markedly asymmetrical activity distribution. Nevertheless, the differences between per-volume and per-projection corrections remained small, and within a similar range than those we observed. Some strengths of our study are that we\nused 177Lu instead of 99mTc and that we also analysed the impact of dead-time correction methods on patient QSPECT data and dosimetry estimates.\nWe used a different approach than that of Cohalan et\u00a0al. to correct projections for dead time. To achieve this, they inserted a script into the reconstruction loop of commercial software (HybridRecon, Hermes Medical Solutions, Sweden), while we injected lost counts into the acquisition file prior to reconstruction. However, this required in-house scripting in both cases and implied having access to editable reconstruction software or adding an image manipulation step, respectively. Conversely, post-reconstruction deadtime correction is more convenient to perform. While a script or batch file may ease computation of the average wide-spectrum count rate and the automatic look-up of the DTCF, these tasks can also easily be accomplished using common nuclear medicine and spreadsheet software.\nWe concur that, ideally, the most physically accurate dead-time correction method should be used, i.e. per-projection. Eventually, the latter may become standard in commercial QSPECT/CT systems that are being developed. Until then, post-reconstruction per-volume correction appears an appropriate and practical alternative that may be more easily amenable to wider implementation in the clinics. This is applicable to NaI crystal-based SPECT/CT systems. Of note, as newly introduced CZT-based SPECT/CT systems may exhibit less dead time, they should be even less influenced by the choice of the DTCM [15]."
