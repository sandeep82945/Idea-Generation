    "abstractText": "Systemic disruptions are becoming more continuous, intense, and persistent. Their effects have a severe impact on the economy in volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) environments that are increasingly transversal to productive sectors and activities. Researchers have intensified their academic production of multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) in recent years. This article analyzes the research agenda through a systematic review of scientific articles in the Web of Science Core Collection according to the Journal Citation Report (JCR), both in the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and in the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE). According to the selected search criteria, 909 articles on MCDM published between 1979 and 2022 in Web of Science journals in the business and management categories were located. A bibliometric analysis of the main thematic clusters, the international collaboration networks, and the bibliographic coupling of articles was carried out. In addition, the analysis period is divided into two subperiods (1979\u20132008 and 2009\u20132022), establishing 2008 as the threshold, the year of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), to assess the evolution of the research agenda at the beginning of systemic disruptions. The bibliometric analysis allows the identification of the motor, basic, specialized, and emerging themes of each subperiod. The results show the similarities and differences between the academic debate before and after the GFC. The evidence found allows academics to be guided in their high-impact research in business and management using MCDM methodologies to address contemporary challenges. An important contribution of this study is to detect gaps in the literature, highlighting unclosed gaps and emerging trends in the field of study for journal editors.",

Increasingly radical and intense disruptions impact society and companies by generating global challenges and affecting the stability of the economic system. Some examples of these shocks in recent years, such as the Global Financial Crisis, (GFC), sustainability challenges of the 2030 Agenda, COVID-19, war in Ukraine, sanctions against Russia, European energy crisis, risks of reversal of globalization, and political and military tensions with China, should be noted. This dynamic economic environment forces companies, governments, and investors to make increasingly agile decisions to try to eliminate bias in decision-making and minimize risks in professional endeavors. Advanced decision-making methods have been gaining popularity among managers and analysts in an increasingly common VUCA environment. The context of implicit uncertainty has changed the analysis paradigm,\nAxioms 2022, 11, 515. https://doi.org/10.3390/axioms11100515 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/axioms\nAxioms 2022, 11, 515 2 of 37\naffecting management sciences [1\u20137] and creating a need to articulate efficient mechanisms for decision-making in multiple fields [8\u201315]. The first radical shock of the contemporary era was the GFC that began after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers [16\u201318], a situation that created a need to develop better and more sophisticated methods for decision-making in such fields as finance, investment, and policymaking, among others. Society was transformed at great speed and academics progressively altered its predominant interests, as the generalization of VUCA environments transformed the archetypes of researchers and their priorities. Some emerging issues in the academic debate after 2008 are specified in the green strategies of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) [19\u201328], evaluation of decision-making systems based on the urgency and effectiveness of the applied models [23,29\u201337], and the impact disruptions in VUCA environments on global value chains [3,4,19,26,38\u201342]. The motivation for this research article is a drive to describe the structure of the academic agenda in detail and to identify the opportunities for high-impact publications related to MCDC. This study analyzes the academic discourse on multiple-criteria decisionmaking (MCDM) within the business and management areas before and after 2008. In addition, the change in the research agenda produced after the intensification of disruptions in VUCA environments is evaluated, and context is offered to understand the driving and emerging issues that articulate the new debate after 2008. The goal of this article is to present an overview and evolution of the research agenda, allowing academics to learn about new emerging trends, gaps not closed in the literature, and high-impact publication opportunities in the MCDM field of research. In addition, the findings of this study should provide a guide and a roadmap for journal editors to the evolution of the research agenda, facilitating the design of editorial lines and the preparation of special issues that may be thematically oriented to a more mainstream scope among scholars. The article is structured as follows. First, the materials and methods section is presented. Next, the results and discussion with a special focus on the opportunities detected for high-impact publications are reported. Finally, the conclusions of the study are formulated."

            "text": "The objective of this research article was to develop a comprehensive bibliometric analysis on the methodologies of multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM). As per Zupic and C\u030cater [43], the study followed this sequence: (1) design of the research; (2) collection of bibliometric data; (3) analysis and reporting of results; and (4) discussion of the findings. The search strategy for the literature review was an analysis of articles published in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoS-CC). Based on the quality standards established by this study and the purpose of intertemporal comparison between periods, the WoS-CC was chosen, focusing the analysis on journals in the areas of business and management indexed in the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and the Scientific Citation Index Expanded (SCIE). Journals indexed in the Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI) were discarded. The use of Scopus was also ruled out, since the object of analysis began before the creation of Scopus and the inclusion of articles from this database would cause sample biases that would invalidate the analysis and conclusions of this research [44\u201347]. Thus, the WoS-CC was chosen as a source of robust bibliometric information [48,49], for its coverage [50] and its homogeneous availability throughout the period analyzed. The search discarded chapters, books and proceedings, and focused on articles. Based on the high heterogeneity of terms available to analyze the focus determined by the study, the first step taken was to identify the search terms and operators that would allow the identification of the relevant published studies. The PRISMA statement [51,52], widely used in systematic reviews in business and management research, was used [42,53\u201357]. In addition, the methodology proposed by Tavares Thom\u00e9 et al. [58], which suggests that researchers should perform searches both backwards and forwards in order to reinforce the robustness of their studies and through this same practice eliminate the risk of search and/or approach biases, was followed. In this way, the main research\nAxioms 2022, 11, 515 3 of 37\ntopics published on MCDM or MCDA in business and management journals\u2014according to Web of Science categories\u2014indexed in Journal Citation Reports\u00ae (JCR) were identified.

In addition, two subperiods (1979\u20132008 and 2009\u20132022) were constructed for the comparative analysis of the academic discourse and the evolution of the scientific debate in the field. The year 2008 was chosen as it established important conjunctural and systemic changes, which were exemplified by the occurrence of the GFC. In addition, since 2008, academic production has increased based on a strong evolution of academic interest, and new fuzzy-related journals have been created [59].\nFigure 2.

According to the specific criteria selected, the applied method reports 909 articles published between Q1 1979 and Q2 2022, corresponding to journals indexed in JCR. Based on the size asymmetry of the two constructed subperiods (30 years vs. 13 years) and the limitations that this asymmetry represents for a measurement of the academic impact of scientific production, the normalized impact per year (NIY) method was used, in accordance\nAxioms 2022, 11, 515 5 of 37\nwith Castell\u00f3-Sirvent [70]. This method calls for the weighing of total academic impact as measured by a count of citations and dividing this number by the number of years elapsed from the publication of an article to the date of completion of this study. Thus, the NIY highlights the most relevant information since it brings to the surface papers that mark an accelerated academic interest of a topic at a certain moment. This facilitates the process of comparing articles published in different subperiods. In this study, the NIY is used for the analysis of articles, and the NIY average for the analysis of the academic production of journals or subperiods. A citations per document (CpD) ratio was also calculated [70] as an indicator of academic efficiency that divides the total citation count by the number of articles published in a period, or by an author, university, country or journal. In addition, the dynamic comparison of the top 25 articles by total citations and the top 25 articles by NIY for the same subperiod offers information on the articles that quickly become more interesting for researchers, particularly in shorter and more recent subperiods [70]. These types of articles were indicated in this research under the term \u201cstrong trend\u201d (ST) and were shown in the results corresponding to the top 25 articles with the greatest impact of citations per year (NIY). This allowed this article to highlight research that did not manage to be placed in the top 25 articles with the greatest impact by total citations. In other words, the articles marked as ST are mainstream articles that arouse growing academic interest based on the trend accelerator that the NIY represents. [71]. The detailed analysis and evaluation of ST articles is likely to serve as an indicator of \u201chot topics\u201d in the research agenda of a field of study [70,71]. Similarly, this research also applied the ST analysis to the main journals of both subperiods to identify \u201chot journals\u201d as defined by having the greatest impact in comparative terms. ST analysis is a tool that enables academics to more easily select mainstream topics and journals, so that their research will be oriented to the emerging and most active topics in the area of study. It also helps researchers by offering an in-depth discussion on high-impact publication opportunities. [70,71]. The bibliometric software used was VOSviewer 1.6.17 [72,73] and SciMAT 1.1.04. [74]. VOSviewer enabled the analysis of international collaboration networks in MCDM research and the bibliographic coupling of articles. SciMAT showed the strategic diagrams of the two subperiods analyzed, identifying driving, basic, specialized and emerging themes. According to Cobo et al. [74\u201377], following Callon\u2019s preliminary approaches [78], the bibliometric analysis of topics with SciMAT identifies the thematic clusters in a two-dimensional plane that represents the centrality and density of the academic discourse, in order to know the academic field architecture [77] and visualize and evaluate its space\u2013time path [75]. In this way, it is possible to identify the groups (clusters) of analyzed elements and their links with other related elements [73], according to the relative importance of the elements reviewed with respect to the academic corpus under study [79]. In this way, strategic diagrams built with SciMAT show four quadrants that are configured at the intersection of the X and Y axes, with the topics included in each quadrant being characterized in a specific way. The driving themes show high density and high centrality and, consequently, contribute in a relevant way to research and maintain links with their thematic networks, helping to articulate the research agenda. On the other hand, the emerging themes register low density and low centrality, since they are poorly developed, both in the area and in other areas. In the intermediate positions, the basic topics are shown, characterized by their low density and high centrality, reporting a limited development, although they suppose important contributions in other areas of knowledge. Specialized topics have a high density and low centrality, as they are well developed in the area, but in isolation from other areas. SciMAT was used to know the typologies of themes for both subperiods and to understand the dynamic evolution of the discourse of academia on MCDM. For the analysis, the equivalence index [78] was used without network reduction, with association strength [80], based on the simple centers algorithm (min. 5; max. 12). In addition, core mapper, inclusion index and Jaccard\u2019s index [81] were reported.\nAxioms 2022, 11, 515 6 of 37"

            "text": "Proper understanding of the evolving research agenda offers important opportunities for high-impact publishing. There are multiple gaps not yet closed by the literature and in recent years issues have emerged that are of growing interest to scholars. Appendix A reports the top 25 articles and journals. From the perspective of the total impact expressed as the total count of citations for the subperiod prior to 2008 (Appendix A; Table A1), seminal articles on MCDM are located in the index with the highest impact [8\u201315,82,83,86\u201389,91,93,94,96\u201398,100,102,106,107,133], and those that stand out for their high performance expressed in academic efficiency through the normalized impact per year (NIY) method the seminal works of Opriocovic and Tzeng [82] on comparative analysis of VIKOR and TOPSIS (NIY = 132,11) and extended VIKOR method in comparison with outranking methods (NIY = 60,27), and Tone [107] on measure of superefficiency (NIY = 46,50). The academic performance of these three articles is markedly superior to the rest of the research indexed in the top 25 articles by citations. Based on the asymmetry of years included in both subperiods, the NIY analysis for the top 25 articles by citations (Appendix A; Table A2) [19\u201323,29\u201337,84,85,92,95,99,101,108,134\u2013137] offers relevant information on \u201chot topics\u201d for scholars. This evaluation of WHAT research is likely to have a greater impact in the contemporary academic context. Thus, WHAT is determined from the NIY analysis, in order to identify mainstream themes for each of the two subperiods. In particular, the evaluation of the articles included in the top 25 per NIY that were not included in the top 25 articles by citations (Appendix A; Tables A3 and A4; second column: strong trend (ST), shows that before 2008, four very important articles\nAxioms 2022, 11, 515 15 of 37\npublished in the years immediately prior to the 2008 stood out for NIY). These articles addressed topics of academic interest such as robust portfolio modeling [103,138], goal programming models [105] and multiobjective optimization [139]. The articles that are part of the top 25 per NIY after 2008 and that did not achieve enough total impact to be included in the top 25 per citations are articles with high academic efficiency, since they generate many citations in the trade-off per year since posting. Thus, given that subperiod 2 includes only 13 years, a detailed analysis of the \u201chot topics\u201d allows us to identify mainstream topics in recent years. Given the high level of impact achieved by these articles in just a few years, issues such as linguistic analysis for smart health care emerge [140] and MCDM under uncertainty [141], decision-makers\u2019 psychological preferences [142], cognitive mapping [113,143\u2013145], stochastic MCDM [146], big data analytics capabilities and firm performance [147], open innovation in SMEs [145], smart cities [113] and sustainable supplier selection for megaprojects [25,130,148]. The evidence found suggests that the reported topics are presented in the first line of advancement of scientific knowledge. These themes and their semantic connecting detail represent important high-impact publishing opportunities. In this sense, Appendix B (Figures A1\u2013A11) offers detailed information on how to connect the topics based on the clusters of greatest interest in academia, so the \u201chow\u201d shows the connection between the subtopics through the cluster\u2019s networks of subperiod 2. These are thematic nuclei required with interest by the journals, and that make up the academic vanguard. Researchers can identify the way in which contemporary discourse is articulated and build their research on the environment (Figure A1), models (Figure A2), preferences (Figure A3), impacts (Figure A4), multiple criteria (Figure A5), weights (Figure A6), decisions (Figure A7), firms (Figure A8), multiobjective optimization (Figure A9), distance measures (Figure A10) and additive value functions (Figure A11). On the other hand, after analyzing what to research and how to connect the topics to achieve maximum impact, it is necessary to look at where it is most effective to publish high-impact research. Analogously to the previous analysis, evidence is presented for both subperiods. Table A5 (Appendix B) shows the main journals of subperiod 1, ordered by total citations. Before 2008, the 10 journals with the greatest impact on MCDM were the European Journal of Operational Research, Omega\u2014International Journal of Management Science, Journal of the Operational Research Society, Decision Sciences, Tourism Management, Management Science, Technovation, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, Systems Research and Behavioral Science, and Group Decision and Negotiation. The ComD evaluation offers indicators of high academic efficiency for three journals that manage to register at least 100 citations per article: Tourism Management (CpD = 544), Systems Research and Behavioral Science (CpD = 146), and the European Journal of Operational Research (CpD = 103.78). Table A6 (Appendix A) shows the 25 journals with the greatest academic impact in the second subperiod analyzed, offering a useful guide to determine where to publish research on MCDM. According to the second column of Table A6, according to the strong trend (ST) indication, several journals are evidenced, characterized by their emerging impact within the field in comparative intertemporal terms. After 2008, 16 journals appear in the ranking that were not included in the same top 25 ranking of the previous subperiod. The finding of these journals is a very useful recommendation for scholars on where to direct their research on MCDM within the area of business and management once the systemic change in the research agenda after the 2008 took place. The strong trend (ST) evidence found shows 16 \u201chot journals\u201d in the field: Journal of Business Economics and Management, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, International Journal of Strategic Property Management, International Transactions in Operational Research, Journal of Enterprise Information Management, Transformations in Business and Economics, Journal of Business Research, Total Quality Management and Business Excellence, Socio-Economic Planning Sciences, International Journal Of Logistics Management, E a M: Ekonomie a Management, Business Strategy and the Environment, Engineering Construction and Architectural Management, Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, and Tourism Management Perspectives.\nAxioms 2022, 11, 515 16 of 37\nThe results of this article should give researchers a better understanding of the structure of research done on MCDM and MCDA. Among the new contributions to the literature that this article represents is the evaluation of new motor topics though the SciMAT software, which permits the visualization of the most current mainstream thematic nuclei of the academic discourse on MCDM and MCDA. Although the research was not designed or conducted as a meta-analysis, it can be deemed valuable due to the clarity of the information provided. As such, the findings of this study are relevant to the academic community and advance the scientific debate on MCDM. When information is focalized, it constitutes a resource that makes academic interaction more accessible for researchers, allowing for scholarly discussions based on decision-making traditions."

            "text": "The recent succession of economic, social, health, and war crises has generalized the irruption of a continuum of VUCA environments (volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous) that have become global and hegemonic. The existing interdependence among the different systems has a substantial effect on companies, entrepreneurs, and investors, as well as governments and civil society, and forces accurate and rapid decisions to be made. On the other hand, shocks are becoming more frequent, deep, and persistent. In the contemporary era, the first recent systemic crisis that caused major economic and social disruption in most developed countries was the GFC. Since 2008, all kinds of disruptive events have taken place that force managers and governors to make quick and concrete decisions. Following 2008, academic interest in multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) or multiple-criteria decision-analysis (MCDA) has clearly increased. Articles published on these topics in scientific journals in the business and management area in recent years have achieved a much higher normalized impact per year (NIY). In addition to the increase in interest from academia, there has been an important paradigm shift causing the transformation of the research agenda. International collaboration networks have intensified, and Taiwan, USA, Serbia, China, and Spain are leaders in total citations. However, academic efficiency measured as citations per document (CpD) is very strong in Serbia, Netherlands, and Denmark and very weak in Australia, Scotland, India, Turkey, Brazil, Iran, and Switzerland. The theme construction of the scientific vanguard and bibliographic coupling per article analysis show four large clusters that contribute to a better understanding of the structure of the academic debate on MCDM. The dynamic evolution of the research agenda shows a profound transformation of the driving, basic, and emerging issues, offering important recommendations on the construction of the academic debate. The evolution of specialized topics advises scholars on major emerging trends that allow them to increase the impact of their future research. From the perspective of the practical application of the methodologies analyzed, a finding of this study guides future academic production around \u201chot topics\u201d, such as mobility, management of scarce resources, such as water or energy, electrification, and electric vehicles, and new models of business based on blockchain or the sharing economy. In addition, from a particular approach, the evidence found suggests that future research on portfolio modeling, multiobjective optimization, or goal-programming models were emerging topics before 2008, but high-impact publication opportunities are focused on the study of the construction of cognitive maps and a better understanding of the psychological preferences of decision-makers, as well as the application of MCDM methodologies to specific problems, such as smart cities, green supply chain alternatives, open innovation in SMEs, and the impact of big data capabilities on firm performance. The axes of systematic review and analysis carried out by this research offer new vectors to be explored and developed by scholars. In addition, researchers and journal editors can find in this article a roadmap to be used in the planning, design, and publishing of research in the field. Further value can be found in the identification of \u201chot topics\u201d and changing trends defined on the basis of the methodologies used. The main contribution of\nAxioms 2022, 11, 515 17 of 37\nthis study is to offer a panoramic view of the field of research published in business and management areas on MCDM, and to help academics in understanding how the research agenda has been transformed. In addition, the identification of the change vectors of the internal structure of the area guides and advises researchers in their future academic production, informing about gaps not closed by the scientific literature. This research provides journal editors with specific guidance on new emerging topics and the forefront of the scientific debate on MCDM, as well as the uses and applications with the greatest academic impact. A limitation of this study is in the bibliographic methodology used. Future research should complement the scientometric knowledge generated by this research with a qualitative approach that is provided by researchers who are building the cutting edge of science on MCDM. In addition, this research could include a classification of the MCDM methodology that identifies its evolution and its fields of application. Among others, future lines of research should hybridize bibliographic methodologies with others of a qualitative type, such as design and system thinking or focus group, to improve the understanding of the underlying motivations of the researchers, as well as sources of funding, that explain the transformation of the research agenda. Other research should delve into the detailed analysis of specific methodologies used for decision-making, such as fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP) or fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), extending the analysis to the construction and selection of sociotechnical transitions designed to achieve the SDGs.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, F.C.-S.; methodology, F.C.-S.; software, F.C.-S.; validation, F.C.-S. and C.M.-E.; formal analysis, F.C.-S.; investigation, F.C.-S.; resources, F.C.-S.; data curation, F.C.-S.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, F.C.-S.; writing\u2014review and editing, F.C.-S. and C.M.-E.; visualization, F.C.-S. and C.M.-E.; supervision, F.C.-S.; project administration, F.C.-S.
