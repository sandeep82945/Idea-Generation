    "abstractText": "This study presents the results of experimental observation of wind pressure on low-rise buildings in three typical mountain forms through wind tunnel experiments. This research focuses on the distribution change in fluctuating wind pressure coefficients with slope gradient. The variation of power spectra and wind pressure\u2019s probability distribution at representative measuring points with the slope gradient were also included. No obvious variation trend for the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient was identified on the windward side. When the slope gradient was 90\u25e6, there was just a slight change in distribution or value of the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient on the left. However, the coefficient on the leeward decreased and then increased, while on the roof, it gradually decreased. Furthermore, the experiments showed that the fluctuating wind pressure\u2019s distribution in the middle of windward eaves and at the leeward eaves was significantly affected by the slope gradient. At 0\u25e6 wind angle, the wind pressure probability density distribution gradually changes from symmetric to asymmetric at the measuring points of windward eaves and side centers when the slope gradient increases, which shows that the wind pressure probability density distribution changes from non-Gaussian to Gaussian.",

Introduction\nHills and mountains are in high proportion in coastal area all over the world. There are lots of low-rise buildings located in the complex mountain terrain in China. Compared to the flat topography, due to the change caused by the complex topography, the damage ratio of low-rise buildings is much larger under strong winds [1]. Figure 1 shows a damaged low-rise building at the foot of a mountain. Unfortunately, little attention has been paid to studying the interference effect of low-rise buildings\u2019 fluctuating wind pressure by mountain terrain. At present, scholars have mainly studied the influence of different building plane dimensions, roof types and other factors on the surface wind pressure and surrounding flow field of low-rise buildings. Alrawashdeh [2] investigated the interaction between wind and buildings of such geometries. It is shown that the wind load on the roof is significantly affected by building size. Chen [3] investigated the interference effects on wind pressure affected by the roof slope and building spacing of low-rise gable-roofed buildings. Kwan [4] investigated generic low-rise building models by a series of wind tunnel tests.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 2513. https://doi.org/10.3390/sym14122513 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 2513 2 of 28Symmetry 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 30\nFigure 1. Damaged low-rise buildings at the foot of the mountain.\nAt present, scholars have mainly studied the influence of different building plane\ndimensions, roof types and other factors on the surface wind pressure and surrounding\nflow field of low-rise buildings. Alrawashdeh [2] investigated the interaction between\nwind and buildings of such geometries. It is shown that the wind load on the roof is sig-\nnificantly affected by building size. Chen [3] investigated the interference effects on wind\npressure affected by the roof slope and building spacing of low-rise gable-roofed build-\nings. Kwan [4] investigated generic low-rise building models by a series of wind tunnel\ntests.\nIn order to investigate the outdoor air quality around buildings influenced by build-\ning shape, Chahardoli [5] conducted PIV measurements of a simple building with a flat\nroof, and compared with low-rise buildings with eight different roof types. Liu [6] ana-\nlyzed the mean and fluctuating velocity and time-averaged vorticity of three low-rise\nbuildings in an atmospheric boundary layer by wind tunnel tests, and the interference\neffect of wind pressure on the surface of low-rise buildings by surrounding buildings\n(building height, spacing, etc.) was studied.\nIn order to investigate the wind loads influenced by distance between two buildings,\nPindado [7] analyzed the wind pressure distribution on downstream building roofs af-\nfected by upstream ones, and the incident angle of wind. Kim [8] conducted systematic\nwind pressure measurements of a typical low-rise building affected by a large group of\nsurrounding buildings. Li [9] investigated the mean wind-induced interference effects be-\ntween the low-rise buildings by numerical simulations. Zhao [10] used a CFD simulation\nmethod to analyze the wind load distribution and wind flow characteristics on low-rise\nbuildings influenced by different spacing ratio and height ratios of the multi/high-rise\nbuildings. Kim [11] measured the wind pressures on a low-rise building in a large group\nto investigate the proximity effect influenced by surrounding buildings. Meddage [12] in-\nvestigated the gable-roofed buildings\u2019 wind pressure distribution compared with three\nother buildings without boundary walls.\nAlok [13] investigated the effect of outer walls of buildings by wind tunnel experi-\nments. Yong et al. [14] studied five large groups of low-rise buildings with different build-\ning arrangement densities in the suburban wind field by wind tunnel test. Chen et al. [15]\nstudied the disturbance effect of two low-rise buildings with flat roofs, with a particular\nfocus on investigating their mean and fluctuating wind loads in different directions. Li\n[16,17] studied the mutual airflow interference between two buildings with the same ga-\nble roof shape, in which the effects of arrangement, spacing, and wind angle on roof wind-\ninduced disturbance were considered. Similarly, Tang et al. [18] performed a comparison\nbetween the height of disturbed flat roof buildings, arrangement of buildings, and the\ndisturbance effect of wind angle.

Liu [6] analyzed the mean and fl ctuating velocity and time-a ra ed vorticity of three low-rise buildings in an atmospheric boundary layer by wi d tunnel tests, and the inte ference effect of wind pressure on the surface of low-rise buildings by surrounding buildings (building height, spacing, etc.) was studied. In order to investigate the wind loads influenced by distance betwee two buildings, Pindado [7] analyzed the wind pressure distribution on downstream building roofs affected by upstream ones, and the incident angle of wind. Kim [8] cond cted systematic wind pressure measurements of a typical low-rise building affected by a large group of surrounding buildings. Li [9] investigated the mean wind-induced interference effects between the low-rise buildings by nu erical simulations. Zhao [10] used a CFD simulation method to analyze the wind load distribution and wind flow characteristics on low-rise buildings influenced by different spacing ratio and height ratios of the multi/high-rise buildings. Kim [11] measured the wind pressures on a low-rise building in a large group to investigate the proximity effect influenced by surrounding buildings. Meddage [12] investigated the gable-roofed buildings\u2019 wind pressure distribution compared with three other buildings without boundary walls. Alok [13] investigated the effect of outer walls of buildings by wind tunnel experiments. Yong et al. [14] studied five large groups of low-rise buildings with different building arrangement densities in the suburban wind field by wind tunnel test. Chen et al. [15] studied the disturbance effect of two low-rise buildings with flat roofs, with a particular focus on investigating their mean and fluctuating wind loads in different directions. Li [16, 17] studied the mutual airflow interference between two buildings with the same gable roof shape, in which the effects of arrangement, spacing, and wind angle on roof wind-induced disturbance were considered. Similarly, Tang et al. [18] performed a comparison between the height of disturbed flat roof buildings, arrangement of buildings, and the disturbance effect of wind angle. They found that the disturbance effect of a one story flat roof was different from that of two to four story buildings. Weng et al. [19] found that the wind speed acceleration ratio of complex terrain is lower than that of isolated hills; numerical simulation was carried out on a hill with a combination of parameters (mountain height Hm, shape factor R, section parameter L), and the wind field characteristics around the hill and the wind pressure distribution of low buildings after being affected by the hill were studied by S.L. [20]. Zhong [21,22] analyzed the wind pressure distribution of a low-rise building model in three typical mountain terrains along coastal areas by wind tunnel test. The estimation of low-rise buildings\u2019 peak wind pressure coefficient is also studied. Wei [23] compared different extreme wind pressure estimation methods and the estimation methods which were suitable for complex disturbance conditions were selected to study the disturbance effect of extreme wind pressure. Wang [24] analyzed wind velocities and\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 2513 3 of 28\nwind induced pressures on the roof of a typical low-rise building during a typhoon and compared the nonstationary analysis with the stationary analysis to understand wind characteristics and wind pressures on typical low-rise buildings. All these results indicated that the wind loads acting on low-rise buildings only considered the isolated low-rise building condition or architectural complex low-rise buildings group condition in a computer simulation situation. In this paper, wind tunnel tests are carried out to investigate the effect of a fluctuating wind pressure coefficient on low-rise buildings in the typical mountain terrain. A relationship of fluctuating wind pressure coefficient between different wind angles and mountain environment is found. The design consideration with the most unfavorable wind angle of wind load in low-rise building calculations is presented. The effect of mountain disturbance on the fluctuating wind pressure characteristics of low-rise buildings is rarely studied.\n2. Wind Tunnel Tests Experiments\nWind tunnel experiments were carried out in the boundary layer wind tunnel tests equipment in the Department of Civil Engineering, Hunan University, China.

Without the influence of the surrounding environment, the coefficient of A14 increased by 13.2% compared with that of A12. In row A, under working conditions 14 and 23, the middle measuring point A12 had a small fluctuating wind pressure coefficient compared with the edge measuring points A10 and A14. In rows D and G, under working condition 14, D10 and G10 had the largest value among the measuring points. In\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 2513 9 of 28\ncontrast, under working condition 23, middle measuring points D12 and G12 had small values compared with the edge measuring points. The value of D10 increased by 27.6% compared with that of D12. According to Figure 9c, for the leeward side, without the influence of the surrounding environment and under working condition 5, the fluctuating wind pressure coefficients of middle measuring points were smaller than those of edge measuring points. Under the same conditions, the values of middle and edge measuring points differed considerably, and the value of D23 increased by 32.9% compared with that of D19. Under working conditions 14 and 23, in rows A and B, the values of middle measuring points A19 and D19 were larger than that of edge measuring points. In row G the opposite was true, and the value of mid measuring point G19 was smaller than that of the edge measuring points. According to Figure 9d, for the right side, without the influence of the surrounding environment, the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient was generally increased as compared with that under a mountain form, and the values of A24, D24, and G24 were larger than that of other measuring points in the same row. Under a mountain form of working condition 5, the fluctuating wind pressure coefficients of A26, D26, and G26 were also larger than that of other measuring points. Under working conditions 14 and 23, in rows A and D, the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient of A26 was larger than that of other measuring points but in row G, the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient of G28 was smaller. Figure 9e,f show that for both windward and leeward roofs, the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient without the influence of the surrounding environment was larger than that under a mountain form of working conditions. As illustrated, the values of measuring points under different working conditions decreased significantly with the slope gradient increase except for WE26 of the windward roof and WA1 and WA7 of the leeward roof. The changes of middle measuring points WA20 for eaves, edge measuring points WE26 for the ridge, and middle measuring points WA7, WC7, and WE7 for the leeward roof were less obvious than those of other measuring points with the increase of slope gradient. For the windward side, due to less interference by mountain, the value of the central line measuring point is larger than that of the edge measuring point, while for other parts, due to the influence of mountains and surrounding flow, the distribution law of the surface wind pressure coefficient is less obvious.\n3.2. Analysis of the Influence of Mountain Form Slope Gradient on Fluctuating Wind Pressure Coefficient under Different Wind Angles\nAs shown in Figure 10a, with the increase of the wind angle, the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient of middle measuring point D5 for the windward side decreased first, then increased, and dropped again at last. When the wind angle was 0\u25e6~50\u25e6, there was little difference in the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient between various working conditions, and there was no apparent law for this phenomenon. As the wind angle continued to increase, the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient without the influence of the surrounding environment was smaller than that under a mountain form when the wind angle reached 60\u25e6~80\u25e6. If \u03b2 = 30\u25e6 with a wind angle of 75\u25e6, the maximum fluctuating wind pressure coefficient of 0.21 was achieved. As illustrated in Figure 10b, with the increase of the wind angle, the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient of middle measuring point D12 on the left side first increased, then decreased, and dropped again at last. When the wind angle was between 0\u25e6 and 30\u25e6, the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient was larger than that under a mountain form without the influence of the surrounding environment. Similarly, under a mountain form, with the surge of the slope gradient, the coefficient also increased. When the wind angle was 15\u25e6, the maximum fluctuating wind pressure coefficient without the influence of the surrounding environment was 0.21. When the wind angle was 35\u25e6~90\u25e6, there was little difference in the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient between the four working conditions, and there was no apparent law for this phenomenon.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 2513 10 of 28\nSymmetry 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 30\nrounding environment was smaller than that under a mountain form when the wind an-\ngle reached 60\u00b0~80\u00b0.

Fluctuating wind pressure coefficients of representative measuring points with wind angle.\nAccording to Figure 10c, for leeside middle measuring point D19, the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient gradually increased the wind angle. When the wind angle was between 0\u25e6 and 75\u25e6, without the influence of the surrounding environment, the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient changed by about 0.08. When the wind angle was 80\u25e6, the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient considerably changed, and under a mountain form, with the increase of the slope gradient, there was no noticeable difference in the pulsating wind pressure coefficient between different slopes. These results prove that the law behind these phenomena was not so obvious.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 2513 11 of 28\nAccording to Figure 10d, the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient of middle measuring point D26 on the right side gradually decreased with the increase of the wind angle. When the wind angle was 0\u25e6, the maximum fluctuating wind pressure coefficient was 0.15. As shown in Figure 10e, with the increase in wind angle, the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient of midline measuring point WA20 at the windward eaves dropped first and then increased. When the wind angle was between 0\u25e6 and 45\u25e6, the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient at the slope gradient of 90\u25e6 was smaller than under other conditions. Similarly, when the wind angle ranged between 55\u25e6 and 90\u25e6, the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient without the influence of the surrounding environment was smaller than that under other conditions. Furthermore, when the wind angle was 80\u25e6, the maximum fluctuating wind pressure coefficient was 0.23. According to Figure 10f, with the increase in the wind angle, the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient of the middle measuring point WA7 at the leeward eaves increased gradually. When the wind angle was between 0\u25e6 and 75\u25e6, the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient ranged between 0.05 and 0.10. However, when the wind angle was between 80\u25e6 and 90\u25e6, the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient considerably increased. Under a mountain form, when the wind angle was between 25\u25e6 and 80\u25e6, the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient gradually increased with the slope gradient. As different measuring points are affected by the wind direction angle, the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient changes differently. Among them, the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient on the windward side and the left side decreases first and then increases due to the gradual change of the air flow from the front to the slope, while the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient on other surfaces increases or decreases gradually due to the influence of the hillside because they are located on the back of the wind direction angle.\n3.3. Analysis on the Isoline of Disturbance Factors of Fluctuating Wind Pressure Coefficient Varying with Slope Gradient\nIn order to analyze the impact of mountains on low-rise buildings, interference factors are introduced to quantitatively describe the impact of mountains on the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient of low-rise buildings. The expression of impact coefficient IF is shown in Formula (4):\nIF = Cpi,rms Cp0,rms\n(4)\nwhere Cpi,rms and Cp0,rms are the shape coefficients of low-rise buildings after being affected by mountains and without surroundings, i = 1,2,3. According to Figure 11, on the windward side, for a slope gradient \u03b2 = 30\u25e6, the disturbance factors were all less than 1, varying from 0.91 to 0.96. These results indicate that on this side, the mountain form had a weakening effect on the fluctuating wind pressure coefficient as compared with the conditions without the influence of the surrounding environment. Furthermore, the largest disturbance factor (0.955) was found in the right center area of the windward side, and the smallest disturbance factor (0.905) was found in the area above the left edge. For a slope gradient \u03b2 = 60\u25e6, the disturbance factor varied from 0.92 to 0.995, which increased as compared with that for slope gradient \u03b2 = 30\u25e6, indicating that the influence of the mountain form weakened at this point. The maximum disturbance factor (0.99) was located in the bottom middle area of the windward side, and the minimum disturbance factor was in the upper left area. For a slope gradient \u03b2 = 90\u25e6, the disturbance factors varied from 0.92 to 1.0, which had a change in distribution as compared with that for slope gradient \u03b2 = 60\u25e6. The largest disturbance factor (1.0) was found in the left central area at the bottom, and the smallest disturbance factor (0.64) was in the upper left area.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 2513 12 of 28\nSymmetry 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 30 According to Figure 11, on the windward side, for a slope gradient \u03b2 = 30\u00b0, the disturbance factors were all less than 1, varying from 0.91 to 0.96.

The largest disturbance factor (1.0) was found\nin the left central area at the bottom, and the smallest disturbance factor (0.64) was in the\nupper left area.\nSince the windward side is far away from the hillside, the airflow flowing through\nthe windward side is affected by the foot of the hillside, so the fluctuating wind pressure\ncoefficient is less affected by the mountain.\nAccording to Figure 12, for a slope gradient \u03b2 = 30\u00b0, the disturbance factor on the left\nside varied from 0.8 to 0.94, with the maximum located below the right edge and the min-\nimum above the right edge.

Finally, for a slope gradient \u03b2 = 90\u00b0, the maximum dis-\nturbance factor increased or even exceeded one as compared with slope gradient \u03b2 = 60\u00b0,\nindicating that with the increase of slope gradient, influenced by a mountain form, the\nfluctuating wind pressure coefficient in the area under the right edge on the right side\nincreased. As the windward side is less affected by the slope, the change of interference\nfactors is not obvious when the slope increases.\nFigure 11.

As can be seen in Figure 32, as the slope of the hill increases, the vortex formed by the mountain and the building gradually moves downward, and the air flow separates at the edge of the windward cornice and the wall, forming a separation bubble, resulting in a large reverse pressure gradient, which forms a high negative pressure. The separation bubble is then attached to the roof and forms a large pulsating pressure, and the probability density function of the pulsating wind pressure at the wind pressure measurement points located at these positions warps in the negative pressure region, showing obvious non-Gauss.

With the increase of the slope, the wind pressure distribution characteristics of the windward eaves and the middle measuring points on the side gradually change from non-Gaussian characteristics to Gaussian characteristics, and the middle measuring points on the leeward surface have Gaussian characteristics under four working conditions. Among them, the non-Gauss of the roof measuring points WA7 and WA20 is more obvious, mainly because these measuring points are located in the airflow separation area at the front of the roof, and the pulsating energy of the pressure is not only affected by the turbulence degree of the incoming flow itself, but also mainly from the characteristic turbulence caused by the separation of the airflow. Due to the presence of longer negative pressure tails, it has a higher probability of high negative pressure than the Gaussian distribution. The probability distribution of wind pressure at other measurement points is very consistent with the Gaussian distribution, mainly because these measurement points are not in the airflow separation zone, and the pulsating energy of the wind pressure mainly comes from the contribution of the turbulence degree of the airflow itself.\n6.

Conclusions\n(1) The representative measur ment points we e observed for power spectrum variation with relevant parameters under 0\u25e6 wind angle, an the results showed that the energy in the low-frequency band decreased, but it increased as the high-frequency band increased nder a mountain form compared with t e conditions without t e influence of the surrounding environment. This discrepancy may be due to the presence of a mountain body that inhibited the spatial large-scale vortex structure, weakened the turbulence of the incoming wind, and strengthened the small-scale vortex. At the windward eaves, with the increase of slope gradient, the energy in the low-frequency band dropped, but it surged in the high-frequency band. (2) An analysis of the variation law of wind pressure probability distribution of middle measuring points in different areas at 0\u25e6 wind angle showed that with the increase of the slope gradient, the wind pressure probability density distribution map gradually changes from symmetric to asymmetric at the measuring points of windward eaves and side centers, which show that the wind pressure probability density distribution changes from non-Gaussian to Gaussian. Furthermore, the lee side middle measuring points had a Gaussian wind pressure distribution under all of the four working conditions.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 2513 27 of 28\n(3) Compared with no surrounding environment, the energy in the low frequency band is weakened and the energy in the high frequency band is enhanced when there are mountains. This is mainly due to the existence of mountains, which restrain the largescale vortex structures in space, weaken the turbulence characteristics of incoming wind and increase the small-scale vortex. (4) Among them, the non-Gauss of the roof measuring points WA7 and WA20 is more obvious, and it is mainly because these measuring points are located in the airflow separation area at the front of the roof, and the pulsating energy of the pressure is not only affected by the turbulence degree of the incoming flow itself, but also mainly from the characteristic turbulence caused by the separation of the airflow. Due to the presence of longer negative pressure tails, it has a higher probability of high negative pressure than the Gaussian distribution. The probability distribution of wind pressure at other measurement points is very consistent with the Gaussian distribution, mainly because these measurement points are not in the airflow separation zone, and the pulsating energy of the wind pressure mainly comes from the contribution of the turbulence degree of the airflow itself. The non-Gaussian characteristics of the wind pressure probability distribution at the measuring points on the structure surface are mainly caused by the effects of air separation, vortex shedding and vortex reattachment.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Z.L.
