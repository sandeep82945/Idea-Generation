    "abstractText": "Semiconductor-based photocatalyst materials played an important role in the degradation of organic compounds in recent years. Photocatalysis is a simple, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly process for degrading organic compounds. In this work, vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) and V2O5/RGO (reduced graphene oxide) composite were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. The prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and UV-Vis spectroscopic analysis, etc. Raman analysis shows the occurrence of RGO characteristic peaks in the composite and different vibrational modes of V2O5. The band gap of flake-shaped V2O5 is reduced and its light absorption capacity is enhanced by making its composite with RGO. The photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) was studied using both V2O5 and V2O5/RGO composite photocatalyst materials. The V2O5/RGO composite exhibits a superior photocatalytic performance to V2O5. Both catalyst and light play an important role in the degradation process.",

            "text": "In the present situation, environmental pollution is a major problem in the world, causing global damage to the life on the earth. Among the different types of environmental pollutions, such as water, soil, and air pollution, etc., water pollution has a major impact on aquatic life and living organisms. Water pollution is caused by the release of hazardous organic compounds, such as dyes, acids, and antibiotics, etc., from textile, chemical, and pharmaceutical factories into potable water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, and ponds, etc. Most of the organic compounds are carcinogenic in nature. In addition, water pollution directly leads to soil pollution, which directly or indirectly affects day-to-day life [1,2]. From the textile industries, synthetic colour dyes were released during the textile wash mix very well with water in comparison with the chemicals and reagents, so the mix of effluents has toxic properties. Therefore, it is essential to treat industrial effluents before discharging them into the environment. Due to the concern that the toxicity of the effluents has long-lasting effects on the ecosystem [3,4], it is, therefore, important to remove or treat industrial discharge by efficient and effective water treatment methods. To date, different water treatment methods have been employed, such as biodegradation, coagulation, adsorption, and photocatalysis, etc., for the removal of organic impurities [5]. Among these methods, the photocatalysis method is reliable for the removal of toxic pollutants, or the conversion of toxic pollutants to less hazardous pollutants. This method has many advantages, e.g., it is environmentally friendly, there is no yield of secondary pollutants, it is cost-effective, and the catalyst is reusable. The photocatalytic activity of photocatalyst materials is depends upon the spectral response, the light absorption capacity\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 338. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano13020338 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 338 2 of 10\nand the rate of generation of charge carriers, i.e., electrons and holes [6,7]. Efficient photocatalysts should fulfill different requirements, such as good optical response, tunable band gap energy, good photo- and chemical stability, and high affinity for light, etc. [8]. In recent decades, metal-oxide-based semiconductors and their composites have been used for the degradation of organic pollutants, such as dyes, acids, and antibiotics, etc. [9]. TiO2 and ZnO semiconductor materials have been most commonly used by the research community from the last few decades, due to their easy preparation, good photo stabilities, and activities, but the major concerns raised with these materials are their wide band gap abilities and limited spectral responses, i.e., they absorb only ultraviolet light, leading to poor photocatalytic efficiency, etc. [10]. However, despite outstanding success in this field during the past few decades, but there are still major challenges to developing efficient, cost-effective, and robust materials, which are able to absorb visible light with good carrier conductivity, band positions, and stability, during photochemical reactions [11]. Several visible active semiconductor catalysts, such as Fe2O3, WO3, V2O5, etc., have been used for photocatalytic applications. However, among the different visible light active materials, V2O5 has received more attention due to its outstanding properties, such as strong absorption in the visible region, possession of strong photocatalytic activity, and good solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency [12,13]. The band gap value of V2O5 lies in the visible region, without the addition of any dopant or making heterojunctions, etc. In order to improve the photocatalytic performance, different strategies have been employed, such as coupling of V2O5 with other semiconductor materials, such as BiVO4, ZnO, GNS-V2O5\u2013TiO2, etc. [14]. However, for the improvement of photocatalytic performance, carbonaceous materials are typically used because they are low in cost, environmentally friendly, and can be mass-produced. Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) has been widely used as a supporting material for enhancing charge transport properties, organic compound adsorption and light absorption capabilities, due to its outstanding electrical conductivity, large surface area, and good optical properties, with increased photogenerated charge carrier mobility in the photocatalytic process and tunable band gap [15]. V2O5 has been used for different applications, such as lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, photocatalysis, and water-splitting reactions, etc. Chauhan et al. synthesized V2O5-rGO nanocomposite and used it to study the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B [16]. Sharma et al. prepared V2O5/GO nanocomposite by a hydrothermal route and studied MB degradation and photoelectrochemical water splitting [11]. Therefore, V2O5/RGO composite may provide a new generation of material with excellent photocatalytic activity. In the present work, a hydrothermal method was used to synthesize V2O5 and V2O5/RGO composite, in order to study the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye. The bonds formed among the V-O-C are due to unpaired electrons in RGO and extend the visible light absorption capacity of the V2O5 catalyst. Additionally, the role of V5+ in pure V2O5 in absorption and photocatalytic activity is discussed, along with the role of RGO in the V2O5/RGO composite. In view of the above-mentioned facts, it is established that both V2O5 and RGO are good photocatalysts. Hence, composites of these two materials can be a good starting point for enhancing photocatalytic efficiency."

From the XRD pattern, the polycrystalline nature of the prepared catalyst materials is observed. For V2O5, major diffraction peaks are found at 2\u03b8 = 20.37\u25e6, 21.83\u25e6, 26.26\u25e6, and 31.08\u25e6, which correspond to (001), (101), (110), and (301) planes, respectively. All the diffraction peaks of V2O5 match well with the JCPDS card no. 41\u20131426 and confirm that the orthorhombic crystal structure is without any impurities [20]. In the V2O5/RGO composite, an RGO peak is not observed in the composite sample, and the peak intensity of the V2O5 peak is decreased as compared with V2O5. The RGO peak is not detected in the composite sample due to a lower intensity, or possibly due to the distribution of RGO over V2O5, to overlapping with the (110) reflection of V2O5, or due to the small amount of RGO present in the composite [21]. Raman spectroscopy was used to study the structure, symmetry and types of bonding in the V2O5 and V2O5/RGO composite. Figure 2 presents the Raman spectroscopic study of the V2O5 and V2O5/RGO composite. The V2O5 Raman spectrum exhibits multiple peaks, which are located at 144.23, 197.32, 283.05, 404.12, 482.16, and 528.75 cm\u22121.

The peaks at 482.16, and 528.75 cm\u22121 are due to the vibration mode Ag of (V\u2013O3\u2013V) and \u03bd(d3), respectively [22,23]. In the case of V2O5/RGO, two extra Raman peaks were detected at 1350.56 and 1582.85 cm\u22121, as compared to V2O5 [24]. The peak at 1350.56 cm\u22121 corresponds to the D band and the peak at 1582.85 cm\u22121 corresponds to the G band, which confirms the presence of RGO in the V2O5/RGO composite. The G band arises due to the bond stretching of sp2 carbon pairs in both rings and chains, and this band is associated with the optical E2g phonons at the Brillouin zone center.

In the SEM images, the nanoflake-shaped morphology of V2O5 is observed. The web-like structure is formed by these nanoflakes\ninterconnecting with each other. This nanoflake-like morphology is useful for the inser-\ntion of electrolytes through the catalyst surface, providing more active surface area for\nredox reactions [31]. During the preparation of V2O5/RGO composite, the flake-like struc-\nture of V2O5 is disturbed, i.e., the flake-shaped structures are broken down. These\nV2O5/RGO nanoflake-like structures are deposited over the RGO sheet, as presented in\nFigure 4c,d."

A degradation per-\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 338 8 of 10\ncentage of 98.85% is observed using the V2O5/RGO composite photocatalyst. The superior photocatalytic performance of the V2O5/rGO composite photocatalyst is attributed to enhanced light absorption capacity, effective charge transfer, and minimum charge recombination, etc. In addition, a large number of active sites are available for redox reactions as compared to the V2O5 photocatalyst [11,16,35]. Active sites are responsible for the generation of highly reactive hydroxyl and superoxide radicals that react with organic impurities and mineralize them into CO2 and H2O. Figure 7f presents the plot of C/C0 vs. time. A trend similar to that observed with V2O5 was observed in the case of the V2O5/RGO composite photocatalyst, i.e., the concentration decreased with respect to time. Figure 7g displays the plot of ln(C/C0) vs. time. By applying a linear fit to this plot, the value of the rate constant may be obtained; a reaction rate constant of 0.048 min\u22121 is detected, which is higher than that of V2O5. In addition, the R2 (linear coefficient value) value is 0.96, which is close to unity; therefore, it follows a pseudo-first-order reaction.

COD studies provide information on the concentration of\noxidizable matter left in the electrolyte solution, not the concentration of the parent molecule\n[34]. From the plot, the COD value can be observed to ecrease from 65.3 to 22.1 mg/L.\nReaction Mechanism\nBased on the above discussion, the mechanism of the photocatalytic degradation of MB dye using the V2O5/RGO photocatalyst is discussed. This consists of the excitation of the catalyst material by light, the generation of radicals, and the interaction of radicals with the organic compounds. Upon illumination of the V2O5/RGO catalyst, the electrons in the valence band absorb sufficient amounts of energy and are excited to the conduction band, which simultaneously creates holes in the valence band. Excited conduction band electrons can react with dissolved oxygen molecules and generate superoxide radical anions [11,36]. These superoxide radicals react with water or hydroxyl ions, thus generating hydroperoxy radicals (HOO\u2022). Holes in the valence band react with water molecules to produce hydroxyl radicals. These superoxide and hydroxyl radicals are highly reactive in nature [37,38]. They react with dye molecules and transform them into non-toxic compounds. Here, the role of RGO is to reduce recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, promote effective charge transfer and enhance photocatalytic efficiency. Finally, the hydroxyl radicals, which are able to oxidize and mineralize MB molecules, result in the production of different species, such as carbon dioxide and water, as well as other intermediates of decomposition at much lower concentrations.\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 338 9 of 10"

XPS study shows the vanadium to be in the +5 oxidation state and the carbon to be in the sp3 hybridization state. UV-Vis spectroscopy shows that the light absorption capacity of V2O5 is improved and the band gap energy is decreased, when forming a composite with RGO; the photocatalytic properties of the V2O5/RGO composite exhibit an enhanced photocatalytic performance, relative to V2O5. The enhancement in the photocatalytic properties of the V2O5/RGO composite is attributed to the presence of RGO, which provides efficient separation, fast transfer and minimizes recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, C.T., A.F. and S.-W.K.; methodology, Y.M.H.; formal analysis, A.A.Y.; investigation, A.A.Y. and Y.M.H. writing\u2014original draft preparation, Y.M.H. and A.A.Y.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.A.Y., Y.M.H. and S.-W.K.; supervision, C.T., A.F. and S.-W.K.; validation, S.-W.K.; project administration, C.T., A.F. and S.-W.K.
