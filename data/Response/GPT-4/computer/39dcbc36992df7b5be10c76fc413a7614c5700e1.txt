Exploring Other Deep Learning Architectures for sEMG Feature Extraction: While this study demonstrates the effectiveness of a Transformer-based approach, there could be value in exploring other novel deep learning architectures, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) or Capsule Networks, for sEMG feature extraction. These architectures could offer unique advantages in capturing the spatial relationships between muscle activations or in handling the hierarchical structure of muscle movement patterns.

Real-Time sEMG Signal Processing and Classification: Developing lightweight models that can be deployed on wearable devices for real-time sEMG signal processing and movement classification. This involves optimizing the current model to reduce computational complexity and memory requirements without significantly sacrificing accuracy, thus enabling its application in real-time scenarios such as prosthetic control or rehabilitation monitoring.

Cross-Domain Transfer Learning for sEMG Recognition: The paper hints at the model's strong generalization ability. Future research could focus on cross-domain transfer learning, where models trained on sEMG data from one set of tasks or populations (e.g., healthy individuals) are adapted to perform well on different but related tasks or populations (e.g., individuals with neuromuscular disorders). This could include investigating domain adaptation techniques and fine-tuning strategies to maximize transfer learning efficacy.

Integration of sEMG with Other Biosignals: Combining sEMG data with other types of biosignals (e.g., electroencephalography (EEG), heart rate, or inertial measurement units (IMU) data) for more comprehensive and accurate movement intention detection or for diagnosing neuromuscular disorders. This multidimensional approach could lead to richer feature sets and improved performance by leveraging the complementary information available in different signal types.

Interpretable AI for sEMG Signal Analysis: While the proposed method provides a novel feature extraction technique, there's an opportunity to delve deeper into interpretable AI methods that can provide insights into how models make decisions based on sEMG data. This could involve developing methods that can explain which features or patterns in the sEMG signals are most indicative of specific movements or conditions, thereby providing valuable feedback for clinicians, researchers, and end-users about the underlying neuromuscular processes.
