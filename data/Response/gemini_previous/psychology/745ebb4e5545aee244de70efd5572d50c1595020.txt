1. **Investigate the potential of using lysozyme biopeptides as natural preservatives in food products.** Given the high antibacterial and antioxidative properties of lysozyme biopeptides, they could be explored as potential natural preservatives in food products. Research could focus on determining the optimal concentration of biopeptides needed to inhibit the growth of spoilage microorganisms and maintain the quality of food products.


2. **Evaluate the efficacy of lysozyme biopeptides in enhancing the bioavailability and stability of bioactive compounds.** Bioactive compounds often have poor bioavailability and stability, limiting their potential health benefits. Research could investigate whether lysozyme biopeptides can improve the bioavailability and stability of bioactive compounds by encapsulating them or forming complexes with them.


3. **Explore the use of lysozyme biopeptides in the development of novel drug delivery systems.** Lysozyme biopeptides could be utilized to design targeted drug delivery systems due to their ability to interact with specific receptors or cell types. Research could focus on developing biopeptide-based nanocarriers or conjugates that can deliver drugs to specific tissues or cells, improving drug efficacy and reducing side effects.


4. **Investigate the potential of lysozyme biopeptides in promoting wound healing and tissue regeneration.** Lysozyme has been shown to possess wound healing properties, and its biopeptides may also exhibit similar effects. Research could explore the role of lysozyme biopeptides in promoting wound healing, tissue regeneration, and reducing inflammation.


5. **Study the effects of lysozyme biopeptides on the gut microbiome and overall health.** The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in human health, and lysozyme biopeptides may have prebiotic or probiotic effects. Research could investigate the impact of lysozyme biopeptides on the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome, as well as their potential to improve gut health and overall well-being.
