 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the effect of different polymer backbones (e.g. polyacrylates, polymethacrylates) on the gas separation performance of polymeric ionic liquids. The backbone structure can impact permeability, selectivity, mechanical properties.

2. Optimize the molecular weight and polydispersity of the polymeric ionic liquids to find the ideal range for maximizing permeability while maintaining selectivity. Lower molecular weights tend to increase permeability but may reduce selectivity.

3. Explore mixed matrix membranes composed of polymeric ionic liquids and porous fillers like metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) or zeolites. The fillers could enhance selectivity while the PIL provides high CO2 solubility.

4. Evaluate the performance of PIL-based membranes for other gas separations besides CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4, such as O2/N2, H2/CH4, etc. The PIL chemistry can potentially be tuned for different gas pairs. 

5. Conduct a systematic study on the effect of water content on the gas transport properties of the PIL membranes. Many ILs are highly sensitive to moisture which could impact industrial applicability. Understanding water plasticization effects is important.
