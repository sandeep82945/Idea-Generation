    "abstractText": "In this article, subleading (in 1/N) corrections to the action of the one loop dilatation operator in the su(3) sector of N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory are studied. We focus on the system of operators dual to two giant graviton systems, which have a bare dimension \u223c O(N) and are a linear combination of restricted Schur polynomials with p = 2 long columns. At the leading order the dilatation operator gives rise to the free part of an emergent Yang-Mills theory, arising from the open string excitations of the giant gravitons. We verify that the terms we study describe interactions between these open string excitations. The interactions have the U(1)\u00d7U(1) gauge invariance expected for a pair of separated branes.",

            "text": "The AdS/CFT correspondence [1\u20133] claims an exact duality between N = 4 super YangMills theory and string theory on spacetimes that are asymptotically AdS5\u00d7S5. The correspondence can be used to show that states in the string theory correspond to operators in the Yang-Mills theory, and the converse. In this article we are interested in operators that have a bare dimension of order N and correspond to giant graviton branes in the dual string theory [4\u20136]. Giant gravitons are spherical branes that carry a D3-brane dipole charge. As usual, to construct excited D-brane states, we attach open strings to the brane. At low energy these open strings should be described by a Yang-Mills theory, so that the low energy dynamics of these operators should be described by an emergent Yang-Mill theory [7]. Our goal is to study the one loop dilatation operator acting on the operators dual to giant graviton branes, in order to test this idea. This was performed in the leading large\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 0 8\nN limit in [8]. The result matches a free emergent Yang-Mills theory associated with the brane world volume dynamics. Our goal in this paper is to compute the first 1N correction, in order to learn about interactions. The Study on the action of the dilatation operator, at large N , for operators with a dimension of order N is highly nontrivial [9]. The large N limit is usually dominated by planar diagrams, and higher genus ribbon graphs are suppressed [10]. However, for operators of dimension of order N , the combinatorics of the Feynman diagrams can be used to show that the sheer number of non-planar diagrams overpowers the higher genus suppression. The usual simplifications for large N do not hold and new ideas are needed. We will follow the approach to this problem based on representation theory, developed in [11\u201318]. These works developed bases spanning the space of the local gauge invariant operators of the model, that diagonalize two point functions in the free field theory exactly (i.e. to all orders in 1N ), while at low loop order these operators mix only weakly . Specifically, we will use the basis provided by the restricted Schur polynomials [13]. Our approach entails evaluating the exact (to all orders in 1N ) action for the one loop dilatation operator and then expanding to extract the leading term and the first subleading correction. Even with the powerful representation theory methods, this is a problem of considerable complexity, so that we will focus on a system of two giant gravitons. This corresponds to studying restricted Schur polynomials labeled by Young diagrams with two long columns. Since it plays a central role in our analysis, we briefly review the derivation of how the dilatation operator acts on the restricted Schur polynomials in section 2. The leading large N dilatation operator can be diagonalized analytically, with the eigenstates known as \u201cGuass graph operators\u201d. The construction of the Gauss graph operators is reviewed in section 3. In section 4 we explain the identification of the Gauss graph operators with states in the Hilbert space of an emergent Yang-Mills theory. The discussion at this point has all dealt with the leading contribution in a 1N expansion, which reproduces the free emergent Yang-Mills theory. Having set the stage, we are now ready to turn to evaluate the first subleading corrections, which represent interactions in the emergent Yang-Mills. To do this we calculate the exact action of the one loop dilatation operator in section 5. Our computation involves three complex scalars and so is a generalization of similar computations presented in [19, 20]. This generalization is necessary as the operator mixing corresponding to interactions in the emergent Yang-Mills is not captured by the study in [19, 20]. Our final result for the interaction is in section 5.4. This is the key result of this paper. Conclusions and discussion are given in section 6. The physics of how open strings and their dynamics emerges from N = 4 super YangMills theory is a fascinating subject and there are by now many papers on this topic. We recommend [21\u201328] and their references, for background."

(2.4)\nThe restricted Schur polynomials are labeled by representations and multiplicity labels. R denotes an irreducible representation of SnT , labeled by a Young diagram with nT boxes. We have ~r = (r1, r2, r3), where rA is a Young diagram with nA boxes, and n1+n2+n3 = nT . Together these three Young diagrams label an irreducible representation of Sn1\u00d7Sn2\u00d7Sn3 which is a subgroup of SnT . We know the operator should be invariant under swapping bosons \u03c6A. The only way to realize this is to make the row and column indices of \u03c6A transform in the identical representation rA and then project onto an uniquely trivial representation in rA\u2297 rA. Further we have ~\u00b5 = (\u00b52, \u00b53) and ~\u03bd = (\u03bd1, \u03bd2), where \u00b5A and \u03bdA specifies the multiplicity of rA as a subspace of the carrier space of R. At this point we are forced to introduce multiplicities because the representation of the subgroup may appear more than once. We remove n2 boxes from R, and assemble them into r2. There might be more than one way to do this, while they bring us into different copies of the carrier space of r2. We distinguish different copies using \u00b52 (or \u03bd2). Similarly, removing n3 boxes from R we might find different copies of r3, and we use \u00b53 (or \u03bd3) to distinguish them. Finally the remaining boxes in R compose the Young diagram labeling r1 so that no multiplicity label is needed for it. \u03c7R,(~r)~\u00b5~\u03bd(\u03c3) is a restricted character [31], obtained by summing over the row index of \u0393R(\u03c3) over the subspace (~r)~\u00b5 and the column index over the subspace (~r)~\u03bd which both arise upon restricting R of SnT to its Sn1 \u00d7 Sn2 \u00d7 Sn3 subgroup, as explained above. It is useful to write\n\u03c7R,(~r)~\u00b5~\u03bd(\u03c3) = TrR ( PR,(~r)~\u00b5~\u03bd\u0393(R)(\u03c3) ) . (2.5)\nThe trace is over the carrier space of irreducible representation R. The operator PR,(~r)~\u00b5~\u03bd is an intertwining map. In the above trace, it makes the row indices of \u0393R(\u03c3) over the copy of (~r) labeled by ~\u03bd and the column indices over the copy of ~r labeled by ~\u00b5.\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 0 8\nFor convenience we will use the restricted Schur polynomials normalized to have a unit two point function. The normalized operator OR,(~r)~\u00b5~\u03bd (\u03c6) is defined by\n\u03c7R,(~r)~\u00b5~\u03bd (\u03c3) = \u221a\nfRhooksR\u220f A hooksrA OR,(~r)~\u00b5~\u03bd (\u03c3) . (2.6)\nWe will show the action of dilatation operator on normalized restricted Schur polynomials in what follows. It is useful to introduce the short hand\n1\u03c61 = n2 + n3 + 1 n\u03c61 = n1 + n2 + n3 = nT 1\u03c62 = n1 + 1 n\u03c62 = n1 + n2 1\u03c63 = 1 n\u03c63 = n1 .\n(2.7)\nWe also simplify 1\u03c6A as 1A. Note that n\u03c6A and nA are distinct and should not be confused. Now the action of the dilatation operator [8] reads\nDOR(~r)~\u00b5~\u03bd = \u2212 2g2YM (4\u03c0)2 3\u2211 A>B=1 \u2211 T (~t)~\u03b1~\u03b2 (MAB)R(~r)~\u00b5~\u03bd,T (~t)~\u03b1~\u03b2OT (~t)~\u03b2~\u03b1 (2.8)\n(MAB)R(~r)~\u00b5~\u03bd,T (~t)~\u03b1~\u03b2 = \u2211 R\u2032,T \u2032 \u221a cRR\u2032cTT \u2032 \u221a hooks~rhooks~t hooksRhooksT nAnB \u221a hooksR\u2032hooksT \u2032 n1!n2!n3!\n\u00d7 TrR ( [ \u0393R((1, 1A))PR(~r)~\u00b5~\u03bd\u0393R((1, 1A)),\u0393R((1, 1B)) ] IR\u2032T \u2032 (2.9)\n\u00d7 [ \u0393T ((1, 1A))P \u2020T (~t)~\u03b1~\u03b2\u0393 T ((1, 1A)),\u0393T ((1, 1B)) ] IT \u2032R\u2032 ) where R\u2032 and T \u2032 are irreducible representations of SnT\u22121 obtained by removing one box from R and T respectively. IR\u2032T \u2032 is an interwiner from T \u2032 to R\u2032, i.e. we have IR\u2032T \u2032 = 0 if R\u2032 6= T \u2032. One can refer to [8] for a detailed derivation. They are the expressions defined by (2.8) and (2.9) that will in the end be used to define the Hamiltonian of the emergent gauge theory. To make the connection we need to study the dilatation operator in a basis that makes the connection to excited brane states most transparent. This basis, known as the Gauss graph basis, is introduced in the next section."

            "heading": "3.1 Transforming to Gauss graph basis",
            "text": "It is useful to begin with a motivation for the Gauss graph basis. We consider operators which have a definite semi-classical limit in the holographically dual theory, which allows us\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 0 8\nto simplify the large N dynamics. In this paper we consider a system of p giant gravitons, dual to operators labeled by Young diagram R with p long columns. We call this the long columns case, while the system of operators labeled by Young diagram with long rows is called the long rows case. The long rows case has been discussed in [8]. We study the operators with a dimension \u2206 \u223c N , so that there should be \u223c N boxes in the Young diagram R that labels the operator. To construct these operators, many \u03c61 fields and a few \u03c62, \u03c63 fields as excitations are used. Precisely, we assume n1 \u223c N and n2 \u223c n3 \u223c \u221a N . These operators mix with each other only if the Young diagrams labeling them own the same amount of rows or columns. It has been argued that corners on the bottom of the Young diagram R are well separated at large N and weak coupling [8]. This is called the displaced corners limit, which simplifies the action of the symmetric group on boxes at the corners: permutations just swap boxes they act on. Noticing that to obtain irreducible representations of the subgroup we remove and then reassemble boxes at corners, this simplication implies new symmetries and conservation laws [32]. The new symmetry is swapping row or column indices of \u03c6A that belong to the same column. The new conservation law is that operators mix only if the numbers of boxes removed from each column to obtained the Young diagram rA are the same. This fact motivates the notation ~nA = ((nA)1, (nA)2, . . . , (nA)p) where (nA)i tells us how many boxes are removed from the ith column of R and then assembled into rA. Using this notation the group representing the new symmetry is\nH~nA = S(nA)1 \u00d7 S(nA)2 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 S(nA)p . (3.1)\nBoth row and column indices of \u03c6A fields have this symmetry. Thus inequivalent operators constructed from the \u03c6A fields are specified by elements of the double coset\nH~nA\\SnA/H~nA . (3.2)\nSince the above double coset contains the same number of elements as that of triples (rA, \u00b5A, \u03bdA), we are allowed to organize \u03c6A fields using the elements of this double coset instead of the triple (rA, \u00b5A, \u03bdA) [33]. In what follows we show the relevant double cosets we will use to label our operators\n\u03c62 \u2194 \u03c32 \u2208 H~n2\\Sn2/H~n2 \u03c63 \u2194 \u03c33 \u2208 H~n3\\Sn3/H~n3\n(3.3)\nwhere we use \u03c3A to refer to an element of the double coset H~nA\\SnA/H~nA . For convenience we will use the notation ~\u03c3 = (\u03c32, \u03c33). It is clear that ~\u03c3 refers to an element of a direct product of two double cosets. The Gauss graph provides a graphical description of ~\u03c3. A Gauss graph consists of distinguishable nodes and directed edges stretching between nodes. We allow an edge to return to where it departs, but at each node, the numbers of edges departing and arriving should be equal. This constraint follows from the Gauss law of the emergent gauge theory [7, 33]. More details of the connection between graphs and elements of a double coset can be found in [34]. It is evident that both permuting edges departing from a given node and permuting those arriving at a given node yields an identical Gauss graph.\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 0 8\nThus, non-equivalent Gauss graphs can be specified by elements of a double coset and serve as a graphical description of them. In our cases, a Gauss graph describing ~\u03c3 has p nodes corresponding to columns of Young diagram R. There is a species of edges related to each type of \u03c62 and \u03c63 fields, while the number of edges of this species is respectively determined by the number of fields, n2 and n3. For each ~\u03c3, the relevant Gauss graph shows a specified configuration. An example of the configuration of the Gauss graph is shown in figure 1 of [33]. To describe a Gauss graph we let (nA)i\u2192j denote the number of edges stretching from node i to node j, while (nA)ij = (nA)i\u2192j + (nA)j\u2192i denotes the amount of edges connecting node i and node j. In particular, we assume (nA)ii = (nA)i\u2192i. Following [8] we will transform from the restricted Schur polynomial basis to the Gauss graph basis. Since we are considering the displaced corners limit when R has p long columns, some modification of the discussion of [8] is needed. We will use the group theoretical coefficients\nCrA\u00b5A\u03bdA(\u03c4) = |H~nA | \u221a drA nA! drA\u2211 k,l=1 \u0393(r T A) kl (\u03c4)B rA\u21921~nA k\u00b5A BrA\u21921 ~nA l\u03bdA (3.4)\nto transform the labels of \u03c6A fields, where \u03c4 is an element of SnA , drA is the dimension of rA, |H~nA | is the order ofH~nA , and \u0393 (rTA) kl (\u03c4) is the matrix representing \u03c4 in the representation rTA, which is the conjugate representation of rA. BrA\u21921 ~nA\nk\u00b5A is a branching coefficient, defined by\u2211\n\u00b5A\nBrA\u21921 ~nA k\u00b5A BrA\u21921 ~nA l\u00b5A = 1 |H~nA | \u2211 \u03b3\u2208H~nA \u0393(r T A) kl (\u03b3) (3.5)\nwhere 1~nA denotes the anti-trivial representation of H~nA , which might appear more than once in rA. \u00b5A labels these multiple copies so that \u00b5A runs from 1 to the number of copies of 1~nA in rA. One might be concerned that \u00b5A has already been used to specify the multiplicity of rA as a subspace of the carrier space of R. We use this notation on purpose since it has been proved in [33] that the number of copies of rA in R is equal to that of 1~nA in rA, if we remove (nA)i boxes from the ith column of R to obtain rA. Using these coefficients, we define the Gauss graph operators by\nOR,r1(~\u03c3) = \u2211 r2`n2 \u2211 r3`n3 \u2211 ~\u00b5,~\u03bd Cr2\u00b52\u03bd2(\u03c32)C r3 \u00b53\u03bd3(\u03c33)OR,(~r)~\u00b5~\u03bd . (3.6)\nThus, we need a Gauss graph and two Young diagrams R as well as r1 to label a Gauss graph operator, while this Gauss graph, as discussed above, describes element ~\u03c3 of a direct product of double cosets. For the sake of an unit two point function, we then define the normalized operator O\u0302R,r1(~\u03c3) by\nOR,r1(~\u03c3) = \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a 3\u220f A=2 p\u220f i,j=1 (nA)i\u2192j !O\u0302R,r1(~\u03c3) . (3.7)\nWe now turn to the action of the dilatation operator in the Gauss graph basis. To obtain it we need to evaluate\n(MAB)R,r1,~\u03c3;T,t1,~\u03c4 = \u2211\nr2,r3,~\u00b5,~\u03bd t2,t3,~\u03b1,~\u03b2\nC (r2,r3) ~\u00b5~\u03bd (~\u03c3)C (t2,t3) ~\u03b1~\u03b2 (~\u03c4)(MAB)R(~r)~\u00b5~\u03bd,T (~t)~\u03b1~\u03b2 (3.8)\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 0 8\nwhere C\n(r2,r3) ~\u00b5~\u03bd (~\u03c3) = C r2 \u00b52\u03bd2(\u03c32)C r3 \u00b53\u03bd3(\u03c33) . (3.9)\nThe detailed calculation is given in [8]. Our case is almost identical so we will simply quote the result\nD31OR,r1(~\u03c3) = p\u2211\ni>j=1 (n3)ij\u2206ijOR,r1(~\u03c3)\nD21OR,r1(~\u03c3) = p\u2211\ni>j=1 (n2)ij\u2206ijOR,r1(~\u03c3)\n(3.10)\nwhere operator \u2206ij acts only on the R, r1 labels and we have \u2206ij = \u22060 +\u2206+ +\u2206\u2212. Denote the length of the ith column of the Young diagram r by li. Young diagram r+ij is obtained by removing a box from column j and adding it to column i. Young diagram r\u2212ij is obtained by removing a box from column i and adding it to column j. Using this notation we can write the action of \u22060 and \u2206\u00b1 as\n\u22060ijOR,r(~\u03c3) = \u2212(2N \u2212 lri \u2212 lrj )OR,r(~\u03c3) \u2206\u00b1ijOR,r(~\u03c3) = \u221a (N \u2212 lri)(N \u2212 lrj )OR\u00b1ij ,r\u00b1ij (~\u03c3) . (3.11)\nThe action of D32, which is described by matrix M32, is more complicated. It is given by\n(M32)R,r1,~\u03c3;T,t1,~\u03c4 = \u2211 R\u2032i,T \u2032 j \u03b4r1t1\u03b4R\u2032iT \u2032 j\u221a |OR,r1 (~\u03c3)| 2 |OT,t1 (~\u03c4)| 2\n\u221a cRR\u2032icTT \u2032 j\nlRi lTj\n\u00d7 [2\u03b4ik(n3)i(n2)i \u2212 ((n3)ki(n2)ii + (n3)ii(n2)ik)] \u2211\n\u03b31,\u03b32\u2208H2 \u03b4(~\u03c3\u22121\u03b31~\u03c4\u03b32)\n(3.12) where R\u2032i denotes the Young diagram produced by removing one box from the ith column, and cRR\u2032i is the factor of the removed box. We assume that tA is obtained by removing (n\u2032A)i boxes from the ith column of T and H2 = H~n\u20323 \u00d7H~n2 . A Gauss graph has the norm as what follows\n|OR,r(~\u03c3)|2 = p\u220f\ni,j=1\n( n~\u03c32 ) i\u2192j ! ( n~\u03c33 ) i\u2192j ! (3.13)\nwhere the superscript ~\u03c3 of nA indicates it is counting edges in the Gauss graph describing ~\u03c3. In this paper, we focus on the matrix M32 which describes the interaction between excitations."

            "heading": "3.2 Long columns",
            "text": "Our discussion has frequently used results obtained in [8], in which the discussion about the displaced corner limit is given in the case that restricted Schur polynomials have long rows. But the same conclusions follow for the long column case, and we will explain it in this section. Firstly, we argue that the action of the dilatation operator on restricted Schur polynomials, (MAB)R(~r)~\u00b5~\u03bd,T (~t)~\u03b1~\u03b2 , in the long column case has the same form as that in the long\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 0 8\nrow case. In the displaced corners limit, swapping boxes in the same column yields a minus sign. Thus, \u0393R((1, 1A)) should be identified with sgn((1, 1A))(1, 1A) = \u2212(1, 1A), while \u0393R((1, 1B)) should be identified with \u2212(1, 1B). In equation (2.9) we find four \u0393R((1, 1A)) and two \u0393R((1, 1B)), which gives rise to (\u22121)6 = 1. Thus, this action is identical in both cases of the displaced corners limit. Next, the action of the dilatation operator on Gauss graph operators, (MAB)R,r1,~\u03c3;T,t1,~\u03c4 , will also be proved identical in both cases. Note that we obtain this action by using group theoretical coefficients CrA\u00b5A\u03bdA to perform the transformation shown in equation (3.8). The coefficient used in the long row case reads\nC\u0303rA\u00b5A\u03bdA(\u03c4) = |H~nA | \u221a drA nA! drA\u2211 k,l=1 \u0393(rA)kl (\u03c4)B rA\u21921H~nA k\u00b5A B rA\u21921H~nA l\u03bdA\n(3.14)\nwhere 1H~nA denotes the trivial representation of H~nA as a subspace of rA. The tilde, as in C\u0303rA\u00b5A\u03bdA(\u03c4) is used to distinguish this branching coefficient from the coefficient used in the long column case.

What Yang-Mills theory do we expect? The operators we study have p long columns so that this system can be identified with a system of p giant gravitons based on the holographic duality. It motivates us to guess that the emergent Hamiltonian describes the worldvolume dynamics of these gravitons. We expect this world volume dynamics, which should be a super Yang-Mills theory since it arises from the dynamics of open string excitations stretching between the giant graviton branes, to match with the emergent Hamiltonian we derive. To confirm our expectation, we will explicitly write down the Hamiltonian of this Yang-Mills theory for comparison. We expect a U(p) gauge theory as the system consists of p giant graviton branes. Each column in Young diagram R, or equivalently, each node in the Gauss graph corresponds to a brane. Therefore, the edges are naturally interpreted as open string excitations. The branes move in AdS5 spacetime with metric\nds2 = R2 ( \u2212 cosh2 \u03c1dt2 + d\u03c12 + sinh2 \u03c1d\u212623 ) .

(4.8)\nIn the displaced corners limit lRi are not equal, hence the branes are separated, which implies that the Coulomb branch of this gauge theory is being considered. In the low energy limit the dynamics is described by a U(1)p gauge theory. In addition, since the su(3) sector is part of the su(2|3) sector of the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory, we do not expect to the recover the complete U(1)p gauge theory. In fact, we should reproduce part of the s\u2212wave bosonic sector of the emergent Yang-Mills theory [8].

The operators are constructed using many \u03c61 fields, two \u03c62 fields and two \u03c63 fields, i.e. we set p = 2 and n3 = n2 = 2 and take n1 to be of order N . These choices imply some significant simplifications:\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 0 8\n1. Although the dilatation operator acting on operators labeled by Young diagrams with two columns produces operators with three columns, the contribution of these three column operators will be neglected \u2014 the extra column of these operators is much shorter than the two long columns, so they correspond to bound states of two threebranes with some Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons. And graviton emission happens when a two threebrane state transforms into a state of two threebranes with KK gravitons, which implies that in the \u2019t Hooft limit the amplitude of this transition is proportional to the string coupling gs \u221d 1N . Thus, the mixing with more than two columns operators is suppressed and can be dropped. This simplification allows us to study the action of the dilatation operator in the basis consisting of a finite number of operators, each with two long columns. Precisely, the restricted Schur polynomials basis consists of 16 types of operators as shown below\nOaa(\u03be0, \u03be1); Oda(\u03be0, \u03be1); Oea(\u03be0, \u03be1); Oba(\u03be0, \u03be1) Oad(\u03be0, \u03be1); Oae(\u03be0, \u03be1); Odd(\u03be0, \u03be1); Ode(\u03be0, \u03be1) Oed(\u03be0, \u03be1); Oee(\u03be0, \u03be1); Obd(\u03be0, \u03be1); Obe(\u03be0, \u03be1) Oab(\u03be0, \u03be1); Odb(\u03be0, \u03be1); Oeb(\u03be0, \u03be1); Obb(\u03be0, \u03be1) .\n(5.1)\nOur notation is as follows: we use (\u03be0, \u03be1) to specify the Young diagram r1 which has \u03be0 rows with two boxes and \u03be1 rows with one box. a, b, c, d are used to specify the irreducible representation rA and ~nA, the vector with elements as amounts of boxes removed from each column of the Young diagram R to be assembled into rA, as what follows\na\u2192\n\u2217 \u2217\n; , b\u2192 \u2217 \u2217 ; ,\nd\u2192 \u2217\n\u2217\n; , e\u2192 \u2217\n\u2217\n; ,\n(5.2)\nwhere on the r.h.s. the first Young diagram denotes R while the last Young diagram denotes rA. We label the boxes to be removed by \u2217. For example, by removing one box from each column of R and assembling them into we obtain d, so that we have ~n = (1, 1). Both r2 and r3 can be one of a, b, c, d so that we have 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 operators, while the first subscript specifies r2 and the second subscript specifies r3. For instance, Oae(\u03be0, \u03be1) denote the operator labeled by r1 = (\u03be0, \u03be1), r2 = a, r3 = e with ~n2 = (2, 0), ~n3 = (1, 1) \u2014 we first remove one box from each column of R and reassemble them into to obtain r3 = e, and then remove two boxes from the first column of R to obtain r2 = a. Note that when deciding how removed boxes can\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 0 8\nbe assembled to give an irreducible representation, we must respect edges that are joined. The remaining part of R is nothing but r1 = (\u03be0, \u03be1).\n2. It can be proved that when the Young diagram R has only two columns, no multiplicity label ~\u00b5 is needed, i.e. each ~r = (r1, r2, r3), the irreducible representation of Sn1 \u00d7 Sn2 \u00d7 Sn3 as the subgroup of SnT , appear only once as the subspace of R [20]. This fact simplifies the interwiner PR,(~r)~\u00b5~\u03bd as the projector PR\u2192(~r) from R onto its subspace ~r. It allows us to explicitly write down PR\u2192(~r) using the basis of ~r represented by the Young-Yamanouchi symbol.\nAs an example, we will explain how to obtain PR\u2192(\u03be0,\u03be1)da, where the subspace it projects onto is specified by r1 = (\u03be0, \u03be1), r2 = d, r3 = a. This subspace should be spanned by\n|1, i\u3009 = | 4\n3 2 1\ni\u3009 ; |2, i\u3009 = | 3\n4 2 1\ni\u3009 (5.3)\nwhere we assume Sn3 acts on numbers 1, 2 while Sn2 acts on 3, 4. We use label i to denote dr1 different ways to fill out the remaining boxes. Thus, the above basis spans a 2dr1\u2212dimensional space given by (\u03be0, \u03be1)da \u2295 (\u03be0, \u03be1)ea. The irreducible representation (\u03be0, \u03be1)da is furnished by vectors\n| i , 4 3 , 21 \u3009 = A |1, i\u3009+B |2, i\u3009 . (5.4)\nAllowing \u0393R((34)) to act on the above vector and using the well-known action of \u0393R(\u03c3) on the Young-Yamanouchi vector, we obtain the following equation\nA = \u2212 1(\u03be1 + 2) A+ \u221a 1\u2212 1(\u03be1 + 2)2 B\nB = \u221a\n1\u2212 1(\u03be1 + 2)2 A+ 1(\u03be1 + 2) B .\n(5.5)\nWith the normalization A2 +B2 = 1, we obtain a solution\nA = \u221a\n\u03be1 + 1 2(\u03be1 + 2)\n; B = \u221a\n\u03be1 + 3 2(\u03be1 + 2) . (5.6)\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 0 8\nFinally, we can write the projector PR\u2192(\u03be0,\u03be1)da as\nPR\u2192(\u03be0,\u03be1)da = \u2211 i | i , 4 3 , 21 \u3009 \u3008 i , 4 3 , 2 1 |\n= \u2211 i\n( \u03be1 + 1\n2(\u03be1 + 2) |1, i\u3009 \u30081, i|+\n\u221a (\u03be1 + 1)(\u03be1 + 3)\n2(\u03be1 + 2) |1, i\u3009 \u30082, i|\n+ \u221a\n(\u03be1 + 1)(\u03be1 + 3) 2(\u03be1 + 2) |2, i\u3009 \u30081, i|+ \u03be1 + 32(\u03be1 + 2) |2, i\u3009 \u30082, i|\n) .\n(5.7)\n3. Labeling the Young diagram r1 by a pair of parameters (\u03be0, \u03be1) makes it straight forward to consider the large N limit and the displaced corners limit. We assume \u03be0 \u223c N and \u03be0 \u03be1 when we refer to the large N limit, hence we are allowed to set \u03be0 + \u03be1 + a = \u03be0 where a is any number of order 1. When we refer to the displaced corners limit, we assume \u03be1 \u223c \u221a N , which allows us to set \u03be1 +a = \u03be1 and drop terms\nof order higher than (or equal to) 1\u03be1 . Our computation thus has two small numbers, 1 \u03be0\nand 1\u03be1 . We can expand in these two numbers, dropping higher order terms which provides a dramatic simplification.\nThanks to this simplification, it is possible to perform an analytic calculation to derive the exact action of the dilatation operator. We will explain this calculation next."

Based on the discussion in above sections, our calculation can be summarized as\n1. Calculate the action of the dilatation operator in the restricted Schur polynomial basis according to equation (2.9). The bulk of the work for this step is to compute the trace TrR(\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) by expressing operators traced in terms of the Young-Yamanouchi vectors, which give a basis for R. In this step, we end up obtaining some 16 \u00d7 16 matrices describing the action of D31, D21, D32 in the restricted Schur polynomial basis.\n2. Perform the transformation shown in equation (3.8) on the matrices obtained in the last step. This entails computing the group theoretic coefficients given in equation (3.4). This gives three 16 \u00d7 16 matrices, describing the action of D31, D21, D32 in the Gauss graph basis. These matrices have entries dependent on \u03be0, \u03be1.\n3. Finally, we can expand the answer, after performing a power series expansion in the two small parameters 1/\u03be0 and 1/\u03be1. In order to refer to the large N limit, we first expand results in 1/\u03be0 and retain terms of the leading order of it. In practice, terms of order (1/\u03be0)0 are retained in D31 and D21, while those of order 1/\u03be0 are retained in D32. Then, we expand answers in 1/\u03be1. Eventually, the leading contribution to\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 0 8\nD31 and D21 comes from terms of order 1/(\u03be0\u03be1)0, and the leading contribution to D32 is given by terms of order 1/(\u03be0\u03be 01 ). Therefore, the subleading correction to D32 is given by terms of order 1/(\u03be0\u03be1). The leading order must agree with the analytic results shown in equations (3.10) and (3.12), which provides a highly non-trivial check of our analytic result. The subleading terms correspond to interactions. These are new results obtained for the first time in this paper and they allow us to study the non-linear interactions present in the emergent Yang-Mills theory.\nIt is worth describing some of the details needed for the calculation. Firstly, we will explain how to compute the trace TrR(\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) in equation (2.9). It is principally done by writing everything in terms of the Young-Yamanouchi vectors. As the action of \u0393R(\u03c3) in the Young-Yamanouchi basis is widely known and we know how to write down the projectors that were introduced above, we need only discuss the interwiners IR\u2032T \u2032 . This map is non-vanishing only when R is related to T , either (i) by removing one box from the second column of T to the first column, (ii) by removing one box from the first column of T to the second column or (iii) if R = T . The IR\u2032T \u2032 for case (i) can be written as\nIR\u2032T \u2032 = |\n1\n\u3009 \u3008 1 | (5.8)\nwhile IT \u2032R\u2032 is manifestly obtained by swapping the bra and ket vectors\nIT \u2032R\u2032 = | 1 \u3009 \u3008\n1\n| . (5.9)\nThe interwiners for cases (ii) and (iii) are written in a similar way. Next, we will derive the group theoretical coefficients used to transform to the Gauss graph basis. The main task is to compute the branching coefficient, which is given by\nBrA\u21921 ~nA\nk\u00b5A = \u3008rA; k|r \u2192 1~nA ;\u00b5A\u3009 (5.10)\nwhere |rA; k\u3009 denotes the kth basis vector of rA and |r \u2192 1~nA ;\u00b5A\u3009 denote the basis vector of anti-trivial representation 1~nA as a 1-dimensional subspace of rA. In our two giant graviton system, no multiplicity label is needed and all possible rA, given by a, b, c, d introduced above, are one-dimensional. Thus we can drop all subscripts on BrA\u21921 ~nA\nk\u00b5A and write it as a\nnumber BrA\u21921~nA . It is evident that\nBa\u21921 (2,0) = Bb\u21921(0,2) = 1 (5.11)\nbecause the anti-trivial representation 1(2,0) (or 1(0,2)) of S2 in a (or b) is just itself. In addition, we have\nBd\u21921 (1,1) = Be\u21921(1,1) = \u00b11 (5.12)\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 0 8\nbecause |d\u2192 1(1,1)\u3009 = \u00b1 |d\u3009 (or |e\u2192 1(1,1)\u3009 = \u00b1 |e\u3009) can furnish the anti-trivial representation 1(1,1) of S1 \u00d7 S1 in d (or e). This arbitrariness will not cause any problem as the branching coefficient always appears twice in the group theoretical coefficient. The above four branching coefficients are all we need. Now, the relevant group theoretical coefficients are given by\nCa(1) = |S2| \u221a da 2! sgn(1)\u0393 a(1)Ba\u21921(2,0)Ba\u21921(2,0)\nCb(1) = |S2| \u221a db 2! sgn(1)\u0393 b(1)Bb\u21921(0,2)Bb\u21921(0,2)\nCd(1) = |S1 \u00d7 S1| \u221a dd 2! sgn(1)\u0393 d(1)Bd\u21921(1,1)Bd\u21921(1,1)\nCd((12)) = |S1 \u00d7 S1| \u221a dd 2! sgn((12))\u0393 d((12))Bd\u21921(1,1)Bd\u21921(1,1)\nCe(1) = |S1 \u00d7 S1| \u221a de 2! sgn(1)\u0393 e(1)Be\u21921(1,1)Be\u21921(1,1)\nCe((12)) = |S1 \u00d7 S1| \u221a de 2! sgn((12))\u0393 e((12))Be\u21921(1,1)Be\u21921(1,1)\n(5.13)\nwhere the elements of S2 are denoted by 1 (the identity) as well as (12), and we use the fact that \u0393rT (\u03c3) = sgn(\u03c3)\u0393r(\u03c3) for the symmetric group. The final results are\nCa(1) = \u221a 2; Cb(1) = \u221a 2;\nCd(1) = 1\u221a 2 ; Cd((12)) = \u2212 1\u221a 2 Ce(1) = 1\u221a 2 ; Ce((12)) = 1\u221a 2 .\n(5.14)\nNotice that Ca((12)) and Cb((12)) are not needed. To understand why this is the case, recall that the l.h.s. of the basis transformation shown in equation (3.6), requires only Gauss graph operators with non-equivalent \u03c3A. With rA = a, we have H~nA = S2 so that all elements of S2 are in the same equivalence class of the double coset S2\\S2/S2. Thus for rA = a, we only need operators with \u03c3A = 1. In fact, a simple calculation shows that Ca(1) = Ca((12)) as we expect. The same argument shows that Cb((12)) is not needed for the same reason. However, for rA = d or e, we have H~nA = S1 \u00d7 S1. In this case, 1 and (12) are in different classes of the double coset (S1\u00d7S1)\\S2/(S1\u00d7S1) so that they are not equivalent. Hence, we need both operators with \u03c3A = 1 as well as \u03c3A = (12). Finally, as we will use Gauss graph operators to diagonalize the dilatation operator, we implicitly assume that D31 and D21 commute with D32. And we find this is true by using the exact result we obtain to calculate the commutators \u2014 matrix elements in commutators [D31, D32] and [D21, D32] are of order higher or equal to 1/(\u03be0\u03be21) in the expansion introduced above. Thus, they vanish at the order we consider. These details give everything that is needed to carry out the calculation We give the results in the next subsection.\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 0 8"

            "text": "To express the result for the action of the dilatation operator in the Gauss graph basis, it is worth introducing a concise notation to specify the relevant Gauss graph operators. We use \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 to specify ~nA where\n\u03b1 = (2, 0); \u03b2 = (0, 2); \u03b3 = (1, 1) . (5.15)\nFor example, O(\u03be0,\u03be1)\u03b3\u03b1((12), 1) specifies the Gauss graph operator with ~n2 = \u03b3, ~n3 = \u03b1, \u03c32 = (12), \u03c33 = 1 and r1 = (\u03be0, \u03be1). With the help of equation (3.6), we see that this Gauss graph operator is given by\nO(\u03be0,\u03be1)\u03b3\u03b1((12), 1) = C d((12))Ca(1)Oda(\u03be0, \u03be1) + Ce((12))Ca(1)Oea(\u03be0, \u03be1)\n= \u2212Oda(\u03be0, \u03be1) +Oea(\u03be0, \u03be1) . (5.16)\nIt is evident that we have 16 Gauss graph operators. In the notation we have just introduced, they can be written as\nO(\u03be0,\u03be1)\u03b1\u03b1(1, 1); O(\u03be0,\u03be1)\u03b3\u03b1(1, 1); O(\u03be0,\u03be1)\u03b3\u03b1((12), 1); O(\u03be0,\u03be1)\u03b2\u03b1(1, 1);\nO(\u03be0,\u03be1)\u03b1\u03b3(1, 1); O(\u03be0,\u03be1)\u03b1\u03b3(1, (12)); O(\u03be0,\u03be1)\u03b3\u03b3(1, 1); O(\u03be0,\u03be1)\u03b3\u03b3(1, (12));\nO(\u03be0,\u03be1)\u03b3\u03b3((12), 1); O(\u03be0,\u03be1)\u03b3\u03b3((12), (12)); O(\u03be0,\u03be1)\u03b2\u03b3(1, 1); O(\u03be0,\u03be1)\u03b2\u03b3(1, (12));\nO(\u03be0,\u03be1)\u03b1\u03b2(1, 1); O(\u03be0,\u03be1)\u03b3\u03b2(1, 1); O(\u03be0,\u03be1)\u03b3\u03b2((12), 1); O(\u03be0,\u03be1)\u03b2\u03b2(1, 1) .\n(5.17)\nEach of these operators is specified by a Gauss graph. We will soon spell this correspondence out in detail. In terms of this notation, the action of the dilatation operator in the Gauss graph basis calculated analytically is shown below. We have considered the large N limit and the displaced corners limit, hence we show the leading order result. Only the non-vanishing matrix elements are shown. For example, our analytic result implies that D31O(\u03be0,\u03be1)\u03b3\u03b1(1, 1) = 0, so we will not write it down.

            "text": "Our main interest in this section, is the subleading contribution to the action of D32, which describes interactions of the excitations of branes, given by the edges of the Gauss graphs. The leading order result is expected to have the form given in equation (3.12), which has been argued to arise from the interaction Hamiltonian Tr ( [b\u0304, a\u0304][a, b] ) . Our analytical calculation has verified this expectation. We will now relax the strict displaced corners limit and evaluate the first corrections which appear. Of course, by moving further and further from the displaced corners limit we will reach a point where our formulas break down and the Gauss graph operators are no longer well defined. However close to the displaced corners limit we expect our description remains sensible, basically because we have confirmed the duality between our dilatation operator and a system of giant graviton branes, owning a nice semi-classical description in terms of branes excited by open strings. We now proceed to calculate the subleading correction to D32. Our two giant graviton system again provides the simplest possible setting for this task. The subleading correction is given by expanding the matrix elements of D32 in terms of 1\u03be1 around \u03be1 = \u221e and retaining terms of order O( 1\u03be1 ). We will assume that we are in the strict large N limit, so that we set C1 \u2192 C0. This expansion yields\nD32 = D(0)32 + C0 \u03be0\u03be1 D (1) 32 .

(5.49)\nThe fact that the matrix of this subleading correction is symmetric implies that all corrections to the anomalous dimensions are real, as they must be. To interpret this result, it is necessary to write it in terms of the oscillators of the emergent gauge theory. Remarkably, this can be done and one finds the following interaction term written in terms of oscillators reproduces the matrix elements of the subleading action of D32\nD (1) 32 = 2Tr ( \u03c3z ( b\u03042b2b\u03043b3b\u03043b3 + b\u03043b\u03042b2b\u03043b3b3 + b\u03043b\u03043b3b\u03042b2b3 \u2212 b\u03042b\u03043b2b\u03043b3b3\n\u2212b\u03043b\u03042b3b\u03043b2b3 \u2212 b\u03043b\u03043b3b\u03042b3b2 + b\u03042b\u03042b\u03043b3b2b2 \u2212 b\u03042b\u03042b2b2n\u03023 ) )\n+ 2Tr ( \u03c3x\u03c3z ( n\u03022b\u03043b\u03043b3b3 \u2212 b\u03043b\u03043b3b3n\u03022 + b\u03043b\u03043b3n\u03022b3 \u2212 b\u03043n\u03022b\u03043b3b3 ) ) \u2212 4Tr ( \u03c3xn\u03022\u03c3zn\u03023 ) (5.50)\nwhere we have used the usual Pauli matrices\n\u03c3z = [ 1 0 0 \u22121 ] \u03c3x = [ 0 1 1 0 ] .\nBy identifying b\u0304, b with b\u03043, b3 and a\u0304, a with b\u03042, b2 as we did in the previous section, the above formula gives the interactions of the emergent Yang-Mills theory. The emergent Yang-Mills theory lives on the world volume of two giant graviton branes. As a result, the gauge group is U(2). These branes have different radii implying that the open strings stretching between the branes are massive. The strings tretching from a giant graviton brane, back to the same brane remain massless. Thus, the emergent guage theory is on the Coulomb branch and the U(2) gauge symmetry is broken to U(1)\u00d7U(1). Under this gauge group we find\nb2 \u2192 ei\u03b81b2 b3 \u2192 ei\u03b82b3 n\u03022 \u2192 n\u03022 n\u03023 \u2192 n\u03023 .

Each pair of graphs shown are mixed by (5.50). They are not mixed by the leading contribution to the mixing involving \u03c62 and \u03c63. The edges for \u03c62 are colored red while edges for \u03c63 are colored black.\nAt leading order, the mixing is between \u03c61 and \u03c62, as well as between \u03c61 and \u03c63. This mixing is diagonalized by the Gauss graph operators. The leading contribution to the mixing involving \u03c62 and \u03c63 weakly mixes operators labeled by distinct Gauss graphs: two operators can only mix if they differ, at most, by the placement of a single edge that has both end points attached to a single node. The interaction in (5.50) allows graphs to mix even if this involves rearranging open edges. In figure 1 below we have shown four pairs of graphs that are mixed by (5.50), but are not mixed by the leading contribution to the mixing involving \u03c62 and \u03c63. The interaction allows both the movement of closed loop edges from one node to another as well as the rearrangement of closed loop edges with both ends at the same node, into open edges that have their endpoints at different nodes."

Let nT denote the total number of boxes in R, while N is rank of the gauge group as usual. There are bounds for nT as follows\nN < nT < 2N . (5.52)\nThe lower limit sets the smallest radius possible for the giant gravitons two giant graviton system. This corresponds to the case that each column has N/2 boxes, so that both still have a macroscopic size. The upper limit reflects the restriction that the number of rows must be less than N and the Young diagrams we consider have only two columns. These bounds also agree with the fact that we are considering operators with a \u223c N dimension so that the Young diagrams labeling them have \u223c N boxes.\n\u2013 21 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 0 8\nFigure 2.

The table presents the degeneracies of energy levels of each spectrum shown in figure 3. We show pairs of parameters N and nT used to compute each spectrum in the first column, while degeneracies of corresponding energy levels are shown in the latter three columns. Notation D0, D1, D2 respectively denote the degeneracy of energy level 0, E0, 2E0.\nIt is easy to verify that D32, D31 and D21 commutes, so that it is sensible to consider the spectrum from a given one of them. Before considering the spectra of D32, consider the spectra of D31 and D21. Examples of spectra are given in figure 2. This shows that the system is a harmonic oscillator with a high energy cut off, in perfect agreement with the results of [19]. Now consider the spectrum of the leading contribution to D32. Again the spectrum is very similar to that of the oscillator, i.e. the spectrum has several evenly spaced energy levels. The fact that there are only two levels is also not surprising and it reflects the fact that each operator is constructed using only 2 \u03c62 fields and 2 \u03c63 fields. See figure 3 for some examples of typical spectra. This sets the contribution to the energy levels of the system. The complete spectrum takes the form 0, E(0), 2E(0) with the size of E(0) set by the formula (\u03be1,max = 2N \u2212 nT )\nE(0) = 2 ( N\nnT \u2212N \u2212 1\n) = 2 \u03be1,max\nN \u2212 \u03be1,max . (5.53)\nNotice that E(0) is an order 1 number as we take N \u2192\u221e. Some numerical results of E(0) are shown in table 2. A simple check shows that formula (5.53) is in a perfect agreement with these numerical results, within an accuracy of 1 \u00d7 10\u22124.

It is easy to verify that the intervals between adjacent energy levels are constant in each spectrum.\nthe spectrum of the system, in table 1 we also present the degeneracies of energy levels shown in figure 3. All degeneracies listed in the table are exact to the precision we use, except for the second level 2E(0) = 0.0200 of the spectrum computed with parameters N = 200000, nT = 399004. We find there are 796 states of energy 0.0200 and 198 states of energy 0.0021. But, as such deviation is rather small, we still assume the second level of this spectrum is 0.0200. In fact, the average energy of these 796+198 states is 0.0200, as we expect.\nNow consider the contribution to the spectrum coming from subleading corrections. An example is given in figure 4. Comparing it with the leading spectrum shown in 3, we see that these subleading corrections give a very small correction to the leading energy level. Simply based on this numerical evidence, we confirm that our expansion converges very rapidly. Again, in table 3 we show degeneracies of dominating energy levels in figure 4. There are also a relatively small number of states of energy 0.0201 in each spectrum. But the average energy is still 0.0200 when those states of energy 0.0200 are included.\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 0 8\nN nT E (0) N nT E (0)"

            "text": "In this article we have evaluated subleading, in 1/N , corrections to the dilation operator. This was done by performing and exact analytic evaluation of the one loop mixing between three complex scalar fields, \u03c61, \u03c62 and \u03c63. The operators which mix are constructed using a very large number of \u03c61 fields and much fewer \u03c62 and \u03c63 fields. These operators correspond to excited giant graviton branes, with the \u03c62, \u03c63 describing the open string excitations of the branes. The low energy world volume dynamics of the branes is an emergent super Yang-Mills theory. Our computation has allowed us to evaluate ineractions appearing in this emergent gauge theory. Our exact evaluation gives a detailed formula for the matrix elements of the dilatation operator. This formula has passed a number of nontrivial tests, giving us confidence in the result. First, the terms mixing \u03c61 and \u03c62 and the terms mixing \u03c61 and \u03c63 are in complete agreement with the results obtained in [19, 20]. Secondly, the transformation of the dilatation operator to Gauss graph basis gives formulas in our example that are in complete agreement with the general formulas obtained in [33]. Finally, the leading terms mixing \u03c62 and \u03c63 are in complete agreement with the formulas derived in [8]. By expanding our exact result to the next subleading order, we have obtained the result (5.50) which is the main result of this paper. The formula (5.50) represent interactions in the emergent Yang-Mills theory. The leading contribution to operator mixing comes from the mixing between \u03c61 and \u03c62 fields, and the mixing between \u03c61 and \u03c63 fields. This mixing is diagonalized by the Gauss graph operators. The next correction to operator mixing comes from the mixing between \u03c62 and \u03c63 fields. In the Gauss graph basis this mixing allows Gauss graphs to mix if they differ in the placement a single closed edge on the graph. The corresponding operators have equal dimensions, so that although this mixes operators with degenerate scaling dimensions, there is no correction to the spectrum of anomalous dimensions. The formula (5.50) gives a mixing between operators that have different dimension, and consequently it will have a non-trivial effect on the spectrum of operator dimensions. There are a number of ways in which the study of this article can be extended. In the planar limit, arguments exploiting global symmetries were very helpful in constraining the form of the dilatation operator [35, 36]. Similar computations relevant to our study include [37\u201341]. The studies [37, 38] focused on the leading order contribution, while [39\u2013 41] were focused on the su(2) sector. It would be interesting to see if the result (5.50) can be recovered by making use of the su(3) symmetry that is present at one loop, and by making use of su(2|2) symmetry at higher loops. For this task, the action of the su(3) generators acting on restricted Schur polynomials [42] will be a useful result. Finally, one question of clear physical significance, is to understand the emergent gauge symmetry. An initial step in this direction was taken in [43] by showing that the central extension of su(2|2) generates gauge transformations. This article has given an exact evaluation of the dilatation operator. It would be interesting to explore the arguments of [43] away from the distant corners approximation, where we expect U(1)\u00d7U(1) to be enhanced to U(2). Does the central extension correctly generate gauge transformations in this setting?\n\u2013 25 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 5 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 0 8"
