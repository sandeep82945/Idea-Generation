From this multiple-time distribution, we show that the visitation statistics of 1d random walks are temporally correlated and we quantify the non-Markovian nature of the process. We exploit these ideas to derive unexpected results for the two-time trapping problem and also to determine the visitation statistics of two important stochastic processes, the run-and-tumble particle and the biased random walk.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nA key property of a diffusing particle is the territory that it covers, both because of its fundamental utility (see, e.g., [1\u20135]), and because of its wide range of applications to diverse fields, such as chemical reactions [6\u2013 9], relaxation in disordered materials [10], and dynamics on the web [11, 12]. For a lattice random walk, the territory covered is quantified by N(t), the number of distinct sites visited by the walk up to time t. Underlying this quantity is the distribution of the number of distinct sites visited at time t, P(N(t)) [13\u201320].\nFor the purposes of this work, it is important to emphasize that P(N(t)) is a single-time quantity\u2014the distribution of N(t) at one time instant. It thus provides limited information about the full stochastic process {N(t)}, where the braces denote the set of N(t) values for each time step of the walk (Fig. 1). This stochastic process is generally characterized by all its multiple-time distributions, namely the probability P(N(t1) =n1; . . . ;N(tk) = nk) that n1, n2, . . . , nk distinct sites are visited at times t1 < . . . < tk, with n1 \u2264 . . . \u2264 nk for any k \u2265 2. In this Letter, we develop a methodology to determine all these multi-time distributions analytically for 1d random walks and several fundamental generalizations.\nOne motivation for studying multi-time visitation distributions comes from its central role in the celebrated trapping problem [6\u20139]. Here, a random walk wanders on a lattice that contains a fraction c of immobile and randomly distributed traps, and the walk dies whenever it encounters a trap [21]. The survival probability of the walk at t steps, S(t), equals \u3008(1\u2212 c)N(t)\u3009, where N(t) is the number of distinct sites the walk visits up to t steps (equivalently, the span of the walk in one dimension), and the angle brackets denote the average over all randomwalk trajectories and all trap configurations. This average relies on the single-time distribution P(N(t)).\nAn important extension of trapping is to the two-time trapping problem: for a walk that has survived until time t1, what is the probability S(t2|t1) that it survives until time t2? This corresponds to the probability that the walk does not encounter any traps among its newly visited sites in the time interval [t1, t2]. Since none of the\nN(t2)\u2212N(t1) sites is a trap, this two-time survival probability is\nS(t2|t1) \u2261 \u2329 (1\u2212 c)N(t2)\u2212N(t1) \u232a\n(1) = \u2211 n1\u2264n2 (1\u2212c)n2\u2212n1P (N(t1)=n1;N(t2)=n2) ,\nwhich thus relies on the the two-time span distribution. This trapping probability reveals a striking aging feature: if a walk survives until time t1, its survival statistics at later times is strongly modified, since we now have extra information about the location of traps. From the twotime span distribution, we will show the surprising effect that the survival probability S(t2|t1) goes to a non-zero value, independent of time and trap concentration, when t2 is a multiple of t1.\nWe finally emphasize that {N(t)} is not a Gaussian process (even the single-time distribution, P(N(t)), is not Gaussian [4, 13\u201318]), and thus is not fully characterized by the knowledge of its mean and covariance (partial results for the latter quantities are given in [22\u201324]). Thus determining the full two-time span distribution\nar X\niv :2\n20 2.\n13 82\n0v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\nta t-\nm ec\nh] 2\n0 M\nay 2\n02 2\n2 requires new theoretical developments. We also stress that {N(t)} is not even a Markovian process. That is, knowledge of N(t\u2032) at time t\u2032 is insufficient to determine the properties of N(t) for t > t\u2032, because the position of the random walk at time t\u2032 is not known. As a consequence, not only the two-time distribution but all k-time distributions are needed to fully characterize the process {N(t)}.\nII. SINGLE-TIME DISTRIBUTION\nTo introduce our formalism, we first show how to recover the classic asymptotic distribution of N(t) for a nearest-neighbor symmetric random walk. Our approach relies on the random variable \u03c4k, defined as the elapsed time between visits to the kth and (k+1)st distinct sites. Crucially, these times \u03c40, . . . , \u03c4n are independent for a 1d symmetric nearest-neighbor random walk. This independence arises because the distribution of times for a random walker to visit a new site when it starts from the edge of already visited interval depends only on the number of distinct sites already visited and nothing else.\nWe now relate the statistics of N(t) to that of the times \u03c4k by noting that\nP(N(t) \u2265 n) = t\u2211\nk=0\nP(\u03c40 + . . .+ \u03c4n\u22121 = k) , (2)\nwith the convention N(0) = 1 and \u03c40 = 0. That is, to visit at least n distinct sites by time t, the walk must visit n distinct sites by time t or earlier. We now define the discrete Laplace transform for any function f as\nL(f(t)) \u2261 f\u0302(s) \u2261 \u221e\u2211 t=0 f(t)e\u2212st ,\nfrom which the Laplace transform of P(N(t) \u2265 n) is\nL ( P(N(t) \u2265 n) ) = \u221e\u2211 k=0 \u221e\u2211 t=k e\u2212stP(\u03c40 + . . .+ \u03c4n\u22121 = k)\n= \u221e\u2211 k=0 e\u2212sk 1\u2212 e\u2212s P(\u03c40 + . . .+ \u03c4n\u22121 = k)\n= 1 1\u2212 e\u2212s n\u22121\u220f k=0 F\u0302 (s, k) . (3)\nIn the first line, the sums over k and t have been interchanged, the last line exploits the independence of the\n\u03c4k, and F\u0302 (s, k) is the Laplace transform of the exit-time distribution from an interval of length k, when the walk starts a unit distance from its edge [25]. Here, exit from the interval corresponds to visiting a new site. We obtain the large-k asymptotic distribution of N(t) from the behavior of F\u0302 (s, k) in the limit k \u2192\u221e, s\u2192 0, with sk2\nfinite. In Appendix A, we show that\nF\u0302 (s, k) = 1 + g(s, k) + o( \u221a s)\nwith g(s, k) \u2261 \u2212 \u221a 2s tanh (\u221a sk2/2 ) .\n(4)\nThe logarithm of the product in Eq. (3) is then asymptotically given by\nln [ n\u22121\u220f k=0 F\u0302 (s, k) ] \u223c \u222b n 0 g(s, k)dk . (5)\nSubstituting this result in (3) yields the Laplace transform of the distribution of the number of distinct sites visited:\nL ( P(N(t) = n) ) = \u2212\u2202nL (P(N(t) \u2265 n))\n\u223c \u22121 s \u2202n\n( h(s, 0)\nh(s, n)\n) , (6)\nwhere h(s, n) \u2261 exp (\u222b 0\nn\ng(s, k)dk ) = cosh2 (\u221a sn2/2 ) .\nLaplace inversion of (6) finally gives the well-known expression for the asymptotic distribution of the number of distinct sites visited by a 1d nearest-neighbor symmetric random walk [4, 13\u201318]; this is also equivalent to the distribution of the span of a 1d Brownian motion with diffusion constant D = 1/2 at any time.\nIII. TWO-TIME DISTRIBUTION\nWe now generalize and determine the multiple-time distributions of {N(t)}, starting with the two-time distribution. Parallel to the one-time distribution, note that for t1 \u2264 t2 and n1 \u2264 n2, we have\nP ( N(t1) \u2265 n1;N(t2) \u2265 n2 ) = P ( \u03c40 + ...+ \u03c4n1\u22121 6 t1; \u03c40 + ...+ \u03c4n2\u22121 6 t2\n) =\nt1\u2211 k1=0 t2\u2212k1\u2211 k2=0 P(\u03c40+. . .+\u03c4n1\u22121 = k1; \u03c4n1 +. . .+\u03c4n2\u22121 =k2) .\n(7)\nTaking the (two-variable) discrete Laplace transform, exploiting the independence of the \u03c4i, and noting that the upper bound of the second sum depends on the argument of the first sum (k2 \u2264 t2 \u2212 k1), we obtain\nL ( P(N(t1) \u2265 n1;N(t2) \u2265 n2) ) =\nF\u0302 (s1+s2, 0) . . . F\u0302 (s1+s2, n1\u22121)F\u0302 (s2, n1) . . . F\u0302 (s2, n2\u22121) (1\u2212 e\u2212s1)(1\u2212 e\u2212s2) ,\n(8)\n3\nwhere the argument s1 +s2 comes from the upper bound dependency. Using Eq. (4), we find, in the large-time (small-s) limit\nL ( P(N(t1) \u2265 n1;N(t2) \u2265 n2) ) \u223c 1 s1s2 F\u0302 (s1+s2, 0) . . . F\u0302 (s1+s2, n1\u22121)\n\u00d7 F\u0302 (s2, n1) . . . F\u0302 (s2, n2 \u2212 1)\n\u223c 1 s1s2 exp [\u222b n1 0 g(s1 + s2, k)dk + \u222b n2 n1 g(s2, k)dk ] \u223c 1 s1s2 h(s1 + s2, 0) h(s1 + s2, n1) h(s2, n1) h(s2, n2) , (9)\nfor n1 \u2264 n2. We then Laplace invert this formula to obtain the expression for the asymptotic two-time distribution that appears in Eq. (A10) of Appendix A.\nEquation (9) has several important consequences: (i) First, we may verify that the covariance of the span, obtained in [24], follows from the complete two-time distribution Eq. (9) (see Appendix A); (ii) Second, for t2/t1 \u2192 \u221e, with ti, ni \u2192 \u221e and ni/t1/2i = ai fixed for i = 1, 2, the deviation between the two-time distribution and the product of one-time distributions reduces to\nP ( N(t1)=n1;N(t2)=n2 ) \u2212 P ( N(t1)=n1 ) P ( N(t2)=n2 ) \u223c Ca1,a2 t 1/2 1\nt 3/2 2\n, (10)\nwhere the expression for the constant Ca1,a2 is given in Eq. (A19) of Appendix A. Thus temporal correlations in the two-time distribution are long range, and statistical independence of N(t1) and N(t2) is recovered only in the limit t1, t2 \u2192\u221e with t2 t1; (iii) Third, we also obtain the conditional 2-time distribution\nP ( N(t2)=n2|N(t1)=n1 ) =\nP ( N(t2)=n2;N(t1)=n1 ) P ( N(t1)=n1\n) . Figure 2 illustrates the slow convergence of the conditional 2-time distribution to the single-time distribution P(N(t2) = n2|N(t1) = n1) \u2192 P(N(t2) = n2) when t2 t1.\nIV. k-TIME DISTRIBUTIONS\nFollowing our theoretical approach, the Laplace transform of the k-time span distribution is given by (compare with Eq. (9))\nL ( P (N(t1) > n1; . . . ;N(tk) > nk) ) \u223c 1 s1 . . . sk h(s1 + . . .+ sk, 0) h(s1 + . . .+ sk, n1) h(s2 + . . .+ sk, n1) h(s2 + . . .+ sk, n2) \u00d7 . . .\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 h(sk, nk\u22121) h(sk, nk) . (11)\nWe can derive and Laplace invert this expression to obtain the expression given by Eq. (B2) of Appendix B, namely, P(N(t1) = n1, ..., N(tk) = nk).\nWe highlight the non-Markovian property of {N(t)} by comparing P (N(t3) = n3|N(t1) = n1;N(t2) = n2) and P (N(t3) = n3|N(t2) = n2), as shown in Fig. 3. For given N(t1) and N(t2), specifying both observables can change the distribution of the span at later times compared to the distribution when only N(t2) is specified. This quantifies how the distribution of visited sites at a particular time depends on previous values of N(t).\nWe may also use Eq. (11) to calculate the difference between the k-time distribution and the product of k one-time distributions, analogous to Eq. (10), for t1 t2 . . . tk\nP (N(t1) = n1; . . . ;N(tk) = nk) \u2212 P (N(t1) = n1) . . .P (N(tk) = nk)\n\u223c 1\u221a t1 . . . tk k\u22121\u2211 `=1 t` t`+1 C`a1,...,a` , (12)\nwith ai = ni/ \u221a ti fixed, and where the expression for the constant C`a1,...,ak is given in Eq. (B6) of Appendix B. This slow temporal decay means that span correlations between k time points are long range and are controlled by the largest ratio t`/t`+1 between successive times.\nWe emphasize that Eq. (11) fully characterizes the stochastic process {N(t)} in that we can compute any\n4 functional of {N(t)}. Two important and natural examples are general-order moments of the distribution at arbitrary time points, E (N(t1)\u03b11 . . . N(tk)\u03b1k), and the joint statistics P (Tn1 = t1; . . . ;Tnk = tk) of the time to first visit n distinct sites Tn \u2261 min {t|N(t) > n}.\nV. TWO-TIME TRAPPING PROBLEM\nWe can obtain the exact two-time survival probability S(t2|t1) defined above by substituting the two-time span distribution (9) into Eq. (1). The explicit form for this two-time survival probability is given as Eq. (C2) of Appendix C. Three distinct cases arise: (a) t2 \u2212 t1 t1, where S(t2|t1)\u2192 1, (b) t2\u2212 t1 t1, where S(t2|t1)\u2192 0, and (c) t1, t2 \u2192\u221e, with z \u2261 t2/t1 a constant. While the behavior of S(t2|t1) in the first two regimes can be qualitatively inferred from the one-time span distribution, the last case is subtle and requires the knowledge of two-time quantities. As shown in Fig. 4, the survival probability up to time t2 goes to a non-zero value that depends only on the ratio z \u2261 t2/t1, and not on the trap concentration. Since the typical size of the new territory explored beyond time t1, \u3008N(t2)\u2212N(t1)\u3009 \u221d \u221a Dt1 ( \u221a z \u2212 1), diverges at large times, we would naively expect that the probability to encounter a trap among these newly visited sites will be close to 1 for t2 \u2192 \u221e. Thus the walk should be trapped with high probability at time t2, even when conditioned to survive to time t1.\nIn contrast, the conditional survival probability goes to a non-zero value. This behavior corresponds to the probability for the walk to not discover any new sites in the time interval [t1, t2], P(N(t1) = N(t2)) (see Eq. (C5) in Appendix C). Surprisingly, this expression is concentration independent for the particular choice t2 = zt1, and this result reveals itself only through the two-time distribution. Thus correlations between the number of distinct sites visited at different times are crucial for understanding observables that are functionals of several of these variables.\nVI. RUN-AND-TUMBLE PARTICLE\nMore generally, our formalism for the multiple-time span distribution can be applied to any type of random walk with: (i) a simply connected span (i.e., no \u201choles\u201d in the trajectory), (ii) translation invariance (i.e., the distribution for the next step is independent of location), (iii) symmetry, so that the exit-time statistics starting from either end of the interval of visited sites are the same. An important example is the continuous run-and-tumble particle, a classical model of bacteria motility (see, e.g., [26\u201329]). Such a particle moves ballistically at a constant speed v during a flight time that is exponentially distributed with average duration T (a \u201crun\u201d), after which the particle \u201ctumbles\u201d, i.e., chooses a new direction.\nFig. 4. Long-time limit of the two-time survival probability, S(t2|t1) (see Eq. (1)), of the 1d random walk at time t2 knowing that it survived until time t1. Here z = t2/t1 is a constant, with t1, t2 \u2192 \u221e. The black line represents the asymptotic theoretical value, Eq. (C5) of Appendix C. Symbols correspond to numerical simulations, for different values of the fraction c of immobile and randomly distributed traps.\nFor this continuous-space example, the number of distinct sites visited is replaced by the length of the span. We again define g(s, k) as the leading contribution to F\u0302 (s, k) \u2212 1 for s \u2192 0 (see Eq. (4)). Equation (11) still applies, with h(s, n) again given by exp (\u222b n 0 g(s, k)dk ) . In the SM, we show that for this process\nh(s, n) = 1 +\n\u221a sT\n1+sT tanh (wn/2) 1\u2212 \u221a\nsT 1+sT tanh (wn/2)\nsT + cosh2(wn/2)\nsT + 1 ,\n(13) where w2 \u2261 s2/v2 +s/(v2T ). Together with Eq. (11), we thus obtain the Laplace transform of the k-time distribution for the span of a run-and-tumble particle. By numerical inversion of this Laplace transform, we can compute any multiple-time distribution, see Appendix F.\nFor times much longer than the persistence time scale, namely, ti T , where {ti} is the set of times t1 t2 . . . tk at which the span is sampled, the run-and-tumble walk approaches a Brownian motion with diffusion constant D = v2T . The covariance of the span is shown in Appendix D to have a relative correction that is proportional to T/t1 compared to a pure symmetric random walk. This shows that the span of a run-and-tumble walk converges algebraically towards that of Brownian motion. Moreover, it is the smallest of the sampling times t1 that controls this relative difference.\nVII. BIASED RANDOM WALK\nWe can generalize still further to treat a biased random walk that hops one site to the right with probability p or one site to the left with probability q = 1\u2212 p in a single step. While the previous point (iii) about the symme-\n5 try of the exit-time statistics no longer holds, it is again possible to compute the multiple-time span distributions. There are two new issues that we need to resolve to compute these distributions: (i) the asymmetry of exit-time statistics and (ii) the dependence of random variables \u03c4i. For example, if the bias is to the right and a new site is reached at the right extremity of the visited region, then a small value of \u03c4i likely leads to a small value of \u03c4i+1. These two difficulties can be overcome by introducing the coupled variables (\u03c4i, \u03b4i), where \u03b4i denotes the direction (left or right end of the visited interval) of the random walker when the site i+1 is first visited. We further need to replace the exit-time distributions F\u0302 (s, k) by 2\u00d72 matrices of exit-time distributions, whose first index represents the start of the walk (left or right side of the interval), while the second index represents the exit side. The Laplace transform of the k-time span distribution can now be expressed as\nL (P(N(t1) \u2265 n1; . . . ;N(tk) \u2265 nk))\n\u223c 1 2s1s2 . . . sk (1, 1)\u00d7M(s1 + . . .+ sk, 0, n1)\u00d7\nM(s2 + . . .+ sk, n1, n2)\u00d7 . . .\u00d7M(sk, nk\u22121, nk)\u00d7 (1, 1)T , (14)\nwhere M(s,m, n) is a 2\u00d72 matrix defined in Eqs. (E23)(E25) of Appendix E. This general k-time distribution reduces to the one-time distribution recently found in [30]. After numerical Laplace inversion (see Appendix F), it\nprovides the k-time distributions, and thus the full characterization of the span of a biased random walk.\nVIII. SUMMARY\nTo summarize, we developed a new approach to compute the multiple-time distributions of the span of a onedimensional random walk, which fully characterize the time evolution of the span of the walk. We showed that temporal correlations in the span decay slowly, so that the span exhibits a long-time memory. We applied our formalism to uncover unexpected behavior of the twotime trapping problem and we generalized our approach to determine the multiple-time span distribution for a run-and-tumble particle and a biased random walk.\nA significant theoretical challenge is to extend our results to higher spatial dimensions. While important results are available for the single-time visitation distribution [31], nothing is known for the multi-time visitation distribution. Equation (2) holds generally and constitutes the starting point to determine multiple-time distributions of the number of distinct sites visited in any dimension d. However, for d > 1, non-trivial correlations between the \u03c4i\u2019s arise. To deal with these correlations developing new theoretical methods is crucial.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nSRs research was supported in part by NSF grant DMR-1910736.\nAppendix A: The two-time span distribution\n1. Derivation of Eq. (9) in the main text\nWe decompose the process {N(t)} of the number of distinct visited sites at a set of times {t} by using the fact that the times between visits to new sites, {\u03c4i}, are independent. Supposing that n1 6 n2 we have\nP (N(t1) > n1;N(t2) > n2) = min(t1,t2)\u2211\nk=0\nP (\u03c40 + . . .+ \u03c4n1\u22121 = k; \u03c4n1 + . . .+ \u03c4n2\u22121 6 t2 \u2212 k)\n= min(t1,t2)\u2211 k=0 P (\u03c40 + . . .+ \u03c4n1\u22121 = k)P (\u03c4n1 + . . .+ \u03c4n2\u22121 6 t2 \u2212 k) .

(2.2.10) of [25] (noting that F\u0302 (s, 0) = 1 as \u03c40 = 0). This probability is\nF\u0302 (s, k) = sinh\n(\u221a 2s ) + sinh (\u221a 2s(k \u2212 1) )\nsinh (\u221a 2sk )\n= 1\u2212 \u221a 2s tanh (\u221a sk2/2 ) + o (\u221a s ) \u2261 1 + g(s, k) + o (\u221a s ) , (A3)\nwhere the limit s\u2192 0 and \u221a sk2 fixed is taken in the second line. For s1, s2 \u2192 0, we obtain the Laplace transform of the distribution, L (P (N(t1) > n1;N(t2) > n2)), as\nL (P (N(t1) > n1;N(t2) > n2)) \u223c 1\ns1s2 exp (\u222b n1 0 g(s1 + s2, k)dk + \u222b n2 n1 g(s2, k)dk )\n= 1\ns1s2\n1 cosh2 ( n1 \u221a (s1 + s2)/2 ) cosh2\n( n1 \u221a s2/2 ) cosh2 ( n2 \u221a s2/2\n) . (A4) In the following, subscripts of the Laplace transform L are precised only when the variable in subscript is the only one which has been Laplace transformed. Otherwise, all the time variables are Laplace transformed. We now want the inverse Laplace transform of the quantity (A4). First, we perform the inverse transform on the variable s1.

(B2)\nSimilarly to Eq. (A12), the case ni = ni+1 for any i follows from Eq. (B2). Additionally, we obtain the expression for the k-time span distribution for a Brownian motion with arbitrary diffusion constant D by noting that the previous result pertains to the particular choice D = 1/2.\n2. Derivation of Eq. (12) in the main text\nWe treat the limit 1 t1 t2 . . . tk; i.e., s1 s2 . . . sk 1. Starting from Eq. (B1), with ni \u221a si = ai\nfixed, we have\nL (P (N(t1) \u2265 n1, . . . , N(tk) \u2265 nk))\n= 1\ns1 . . . sk\n1 cosh2 ( a1 \u221a s1+...+sk\n2s1\n) cosh2 ( a1 \u221a s2+...+sk 2s1 ) cosh2 ( a2 \u221a s2+...+sk\n2s2\n) . . . cosh2 ( ak\u22121 \u221a sk 2sk\u22121 ) cosh2 ( ak\u221a 2 )\n\u223c 1 s1 . . . sk\n1 cosh2 ( a1 \u221a s1+s2 2s1\n) cosh2 ( a1 \u221a s2 2s1 ) cosh2 ( a2 \u221a s2+s3 2s2 ) . . . cosh2 ( ak\u22121 \u221a sk 2sk\u22121 ) cosh2 ( ak\u221a 2\n) \u223c L ( P (N(t1) \u2265 n1) . . .P (N(tk) \u2265 nk) ) [ 1 +\nk\u22121\u2211 `=1 s`+1 s` ( a2` 2 \u2212 tanh ( a`\u221a 2 ) a`\u221a 2 ) + o(s`+1/s`) ] . (B3)\nThus we obtain a result similar to the 2-time span distribution for the first-order correction to the product of independent one-time span distributions:\nL (P (N(t1) = n1; . . . ;N(tk) = nk)\u2212 P (N(t1) = n1) . . .P (N(tk) = nk))\n\u223c 1\u221a s1 . . . sk \u2202a1,...,ak [ k\u22121\u2211 `=1 s`+1 s` ( a2` 2 \u2212 tanh ( a`\u221a 2 ) a`\u221a 2 ) 1 cosh2(a1/ \u221a 2) . . . cosh2(ak/ \u221a 2) ] .

(1) of the main text, and going to the continuum limit, we have S(t2|t1) = \u2329 (1\u2212 c)N(t2)\u2212N(t1) \u232a = \u222b n1\u2264n2 dn1dn2 (1\u2212 c)n2\u2212n1 P (N(t1) = n1, N(t2) = n2) (C1)\n= P(N(t1) = N(t2)) + \u222b n1<n2 dn1dn2 (1\u2212 c)n2\u2212n1 \u22022 \u2202n2\u2202n1 P(N(t1) \u2265 n1, N(t2) \u2265 n2) , (C2)\nWe now discuss the different regimes:\n(a) t2 \u2212 t1 t1: In this limit, P(N(t1) = n1;N(t2) = n2) \u223c P(N(t1) = n1) \u00d7 P(N(t2) = n2) for n1 < n2, and P(N(t1) = N(t2)) is a decreasing exponential at large times (since this quantity is related to the exit probability from an interval). Thus,\nS(t2|t1) \u223c \u222b n1<n2 dn1dn2(1\u2212 c)n2\u2212n1P(N(t1) = n1)\u00d7 P(N(t2) = n2) \u223c f(t1)S(t2), (C3)\nwhere f(t1) depends only on c and t1 but not on t2.\n(b) t2 \u2212 t1 t1: From the scale invariance of Brownian motion, as the law of (ND(t1), ND(t2)) is the same as the one of ( ND(1) \u221a t1, ND(t2/t1) \u221a t1 ) , the term P(N(t1) = N(t2)) \u223c P(ND(1) \u221a t1 = ND(t2/t1) \u221a t1) =\nP ( ND(1) = ND ( 1 + t2\u2212t1t1 )) \u2192 1 dominates. We note that 1 \u2212 P ( ND(1) = ND ( 1 + t2\u2212t1t1 )) corresponds to the probability of exiting an interval of unit size after a time t = t2\u2212t1t1 1, whose scaling behaviour is known to be \u221d \u221a t, Eq.

(C4)\n(c) t2 = zt1: The term which dominates is still P(N(t1) = N(t2)) \u223c P(ND(1) = ND (z)), as the integral in n1 < n2 is decreasing (at least as a stretched exponential). Moreover, the conditional survival probability S(t2|t1) converges to a value that is neither 0 nor 1:\nS(t2|t1)\u2192 P(ND(1) = ND (z))\n= \u222b \u221e 0 dn1 lim n2\u2192n+1 \u22022 \u2202n2\u2202n1 {( 2 \u03c02 )2 \u221e\u2211 k\u2032=0 n2 cos 2 ( n1 n2 (\u03c0/2 + k\u2032\u03c0) ) (k\u2032 + 1/2)2 e \u2212 2\u03c02 n22 (k\u2032+1/2)2(z\u22121) \u00d7\n\u00d7 \u2202 \u2202n1 [ \u221e\u2211 k=0 n1 (k + 1/2)2 \u2212 n21/n22(k\u2032 + 1/2)2 e \u2212 2\u03c02 n21 (k+1/2)2 ]} . (C5)\nThis limit is illustrated in Fig. 4 of the main text, as a function of z.\n11\nAppendix D: Run-and-tumble particle\n1. Derivation of Eq. (13) in the main text\nWe consider the exit time distribution, p\u00b1(t, x), from the interval [0, k], for a run-and-tumble particle that starts at position x with speed \u00b1v, respectively. This distribution obeys the following coupled differential equations{\n\u2202tp+(t, x) = v\u2202xp+(t, x) + 1 2T [ p\u2212(t, x)\u2212 p+(t, x) ] \u2202tp\u2212(t, x) = \u2212v\u2202xp\u2212(t, x) + 12T [ p+(t, x)\u2212 p\u2212(t, x) ] ,\n(D1)\nwith p+(t = 0, x) = p\u2212(t = 0, x) = 0 and p+(t, k) = p\u2212(t, 0) = \u03b4(t). Laplace transforming Eq. (D1), we obtain the Laplace transform of the exit-time distribution from an interval of length k when the walk starts at position dk:\nF\u0302 (s, k) \u2261 p\u0302+(s, dk) + p\u0302\u2212(s, dk)\n= (2T )\u22121\n[ sinh(wdk) + sinh(w(k \u2212 dk)) + s sinh(w(k \u2212 dk)) + vw cosh(w(k \u2212 dk)) ] s sinh(wk) + vw cosh(wk)) + (2T )\u22121 sinh(wk) , (D2)\nwhere w2 \u2261 s2/v2 + s/(v2T ). Keeping only the first-order terms in the limit dk k, we have\nF\u0302 (s, k) = 1\u2212 wdk s cosh(wk) + vw sinh(wk) + (2T ) \u22121(cosh(wk)\u2212 1)\ns sinh(wk) + vw cosh(wk) + (2T )\u22121 sinh(wk) \u2261 1 + dk g(s, k) (D3)\nwith\n\u222b 0 n g(s, k)dk = ln\n1 + \u221a s T\u22121+s tanh (wn/2)\n1\u2212 \u221a\ns T\u22121+s tanh (wn/2)\nsT + cosh2(wn/2)\nsT + 1  \u2261 ln(h(s, n)). (D4) To obtain the exit time distribution in the time domain from (D4) is difficult. However, in the diffusive limit t T ; i.e., sT 1 and n \u221a s fixed, one can obtain simple results. By keeping the first order terms of h in this limit, we get\nh(s, n) \u223c cosh2 (\u221a s\nTv2 n 2\n)[ 1 + 2 \u221a sT tanh (\u221a s\nTv2 n 2\n)] . (D5)\nThus, with D = Tv2, and defining {NT,v(t)} as the span process for a run and tumble particle and {ND(t)} the span process for a Brownian motion,\nL (P(NT,v(t) \u2265 n)) = L (P(ND(t) \u2265 n))\u2212 \u221a 4T\ns\nsinh (\u221a\ns D n 2 ) cosh (\u221a s D n 2 )3 + o(\u221aT/s).

(D9d) Integration of Eq. (D9a) gives the product of the first moments. Eq. (D9b) gives the same contribution to the covariance as the symmetric random walk. Integration of Eq. (D9c) with respect to a1 and a2 leads to the first-order correction to the difference of the covariances. However, this integral vanishes. This means that one should compute the correction at the next order, using (D9d). This leads to\nCov (NT,v(t1), NT,v(t2))\u2212 Cov (ND(t1), ND(t2))\n\u223c 2DT\n\u221a t1 t2\n\u0393 (3/2) \u0393 (1/2) \u222b \u221e 0 da1 8 ( a21 + 3 ) \u2212 3 ( 3a21 + 8 ) cosh\u22122 ( a1 2 ) \u2212 a1 tanh ( a1 2 ) ( a21 \u2212 24 cosh \u22122 (a1 2 ) + 34 ) 8 cosh2 ( a1 2\n) \u2248 \u22122.957DT \u221a t1 t2 . (D10)\nb. First-order correction to the span distribution\nWe study the correction to the diffusive limit of the two-time span distribution in the limit T t1 t2; i.e., s2T s1T 1. Keeping only the dominant terms, we have\nL(P(NT,v(t1) \u2265 n1;NT,v(t2) \u2265 n2)) = L(P(ND(t1) \u2265 n1;ND(t2) \u2265 n2)) [ 1\u2212 2 \u221a s1T tanh (\u221a s1 D n1 2 ) + o( \u221a s1T ) ] .\n(D11)\nIf we focus on the behavior of this distribution for a typical realization; i.e., situations for which ni \u221a si = ai is fixed, with siT \u2192 0 and s2/s1 \u2192 0, we have\nL(P(NT,v(t1) \u2265 n1;NT,v(t2) \u2265 n2)\u2212 L(P(ND(t1) \u2265 n1;ND(t2) \u2265 n2)) \u221d \u221a T\ns 1/2 1 s2\n. (D12)\nThis means that in the time domain the relative difference between the two cumulative distributions in the case where ni/ \u221a ti = ai is fixed behaves as \u221d \u221a T/t1.\nAppendix E: Biased random walk\n1. Derivation of Eq. (14) in the main text\nFirst, we write the continuum limit exit-time distribution of the biased random walk of speed v = p \u2212 q, see Eq. (2.2.28) of [25], when the walk starts at distance dk = 1 to the left boundary of the interval of size k (and exits\n13\nthe interval either to the left or to the right side):\nF\u0302 l\u2192l(s, k) = D\u2202x\n( ev(x\u2212dk)/2D\nDw sinh(wk) sinh(w(k \u2212 dk)) sinh(wx) ) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 x=0 = e\u2212vdk/2D sinh(wk) sinh(w(k \u2212 dk)) ,\nF\u0302 l\u2192r(s, k) = \u2212D\u2202x ( ev(x\u2212dk)/2D\nDw sinh(wk) sinh(w(k \u2212 x)) sinh(wdk) ) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 x=k = ev(k\u2212dk)/2D sinh(wn) sinh(wdk) ,\n(E1)\nwith w \u2261 \u221a v2 + 4Ds/(2D). Here the superscripts refer to the left and right ends of the interval. Similarly, by reversing the direction of the velocity, we have\nF\u0302 r\u2192r(s, k) = evdk/2D\nsinh(wk) sinh(w(k \u2212 dk)) ,\nF\u0302 r\u2192l(s, k) = e\u2212v(k\u2212dk)/2D\nsinh(wk) sinh(wdk) .\n(E2)\nWe use the convention F\u0302 0\u2192r(s, 0) = F\u0302 0\u2192l(s, 0) = 1/2, corresponding to starting with a single visited site at time 0, which is both on the left and right side of the interval of size 1. We define the indices \u03b4i direction (left, \u03b4i = l, or right, \u03b4i = r, end of the visited interval) of the random walker when the site i+ 1 is first visited. Performing the same calculation as in Appendix B we get\nL (P (N(t1) > n1; . . . ;N(tk) > nk))\n= 1\ns1 . . . sk \u2211 {\u03b4i}i F\u0302 0\u2192\u03b41(s1 + . . .+ sk, 0) . . .

(E3)\nWe use the transfer matrix technique by defining\nF\u0302 (s, k) \u2261 F\u0302 l\u2192l(s, k) F\u0302 l\u2192r(s, k) F\u0302 r\u2192l(s, k) F\u0302 r\u2192r(s, k)  . (E4) In the limit dk k (taking w(s)k fixed), we obtain F\u0302 (s, k) = I2 + g(s, k)dk, with\ng(s, k) \u2261 \u2212v2D \u2212 wtanh(kw) w evk/2Dsinh(wk) w e \u2212vk/2D\nsinh(wk) v 2D \u2212 w tanh(kw)  . (E5) Using this matrix notation, we have the simpler formula\nL (P (N(t1) > n1; . . . ;N(tk) > nk))\n= 1\n2s1s2 . . . sk UT \u00b7 F\u0302 (s1 + . . .+ sk, 1) \u00b7 . . . \u00b7 F\u0302 (s1 + . . .+ sk, n1 \u2212 1) \u00b7 F\u0302 (s2 + . . .+ sk, n1) \u00b7 . . . \u00b7 F\u0302 (sk, nk \u2212 1) \u00b7 U .\n(E6) where the vector U is ( 1 1 ) . Performing the product of matrices F\u0302 (s, k) having the same argument s, we rewrite the previous equation as\nL (P (N(t1) > n1; . . . ;N(tk) > nk))\n= 1\n2s1s2 . . . sk UT \u00b7M(s1 + . . .+ sk, 0, n1) \u00b7M(s2 + . . .+ sk, n1, n2) \u00b7 . . . \u00b7M(sk, nk\u22121, nk) \u00b7 U (E7)\nwhere\nM(s,m, n) \u2261 : exp (\u222b n\nm\ng(s, k)dk ) : for m < n, (E8)\nand : . . . : represents the k-ordering operator. Eq. (E8) is equivalent to the set of partial differential equations \u2202nM(s,m, n) = M(s,m, n) \u00b7 g(s, n) with M(s,m,m) = I2.\n14\nFigure S2. Cumulative distribution of the span at times t = 5, 10 and 15 for parameters v = 1 and D = 1. The curves are 1 2 (yl(t, n) + yr(t, n)), while the circles are from [30].\n2. The one-time span distribution\nThe one-time span distribution derived in [30] can be retrieved using Eq. (E7). Consider the Laplace transform of the distribution of the number of distinct sites visited at a single time,\nL (P(N(t) \u2265 n) = 1 2s UT \u00b7M(s, 0, n) \u00b7 U = 1 2s x(s, n)T \u00b7 U (E9)\nwhere x(s, n) is solution of \u2202nx(s, n) = g(s, n) T \u00b7x(s, n) with x(s, 0) = U as follows from Eq. (E8). We solve the system of equations for n > 0 (for the sake of simplicity, we drop the argument s and write x(s, n) = (xl(s, n), xr(s, n)) = (xl(n), xr(n))):\n\u2202nxl(n) = (\u2212v/2D \u2212 w coth(wn))xl(n) + w exp(\u2212vn/2D) sinh(wn) xr(n)\n\u2202nxr(n) = (v/2D \u2212 w coth(wn))xr(n) + w exp(vn/2D)sinh(wn) xl(n) . (E10)\nSolving these coupled equations, we obtain\nxr(n) = (v/2D \u2212 w coth(wn)) 2\nsinh(nw) \u222b n 0 ev(n\u2212n \u2032)/2D sinh(wn\u2032)dn\u2032 + 2 . (E11)\nTo obtain the distribution of the number of distinct sites visited in the time domain, we perform the inverse Laplace transform of xr(n)/s, identifying the poles at s = 0 and w(s)n = ik\u03c0, k \u2208 N: yr(t, n) \u2261 \u222b +i\u221e \u2212i\u221e dz 2\u03c0i ezt xr(z, n) z (E12)\n= \u222b +i\u221e \u2212i\u221e dz 2\u03c0i ezt (v/2D \u2212 w(z) coth(w(z)n)) 2sinh(nw(z)) \u222b n 0 ev(n\u2212n \u2032)/2D sinh(w(z)n\u2032)dn\u2032 + 2 z (E13)\n= 2 +\n( v\nD sinh(vn/2D) \u2212 v cosh(vn/2D) D sinh(vn/2D)2 )\u222b n 0 ev(n\u2212n \u2032)/2D sinh(vn\u2032/2D)dn\u2032\n+ \u221e\u2211 k=1 (\u22121)k \u222b n 0 dn\u2032ev(n\u2212n \u2032)/2De\u2212 v2t 4D [ 2k\u03c0v sin(k\u03c0n\u2032/n) v2n2/4D + k2\u03c02D e\u2212 k2\u03c02Dt n2 + \u2202n ( 4k\u03c0D sin(k\u03c0n\u2032/n) v2n2/4D + k2\u03c02D e\u2212 k2\u03c02Dt n2 )] .\n(E14)\nBy reversing the velocity, v \u2192 \u2212v, we get the inverse Laplace transform of xl(n)/s, namely, yl(t, n). We check numerically in Figure S2 that P(N(t) \u2265 n) = 12 (yl(t, n) + yr(t, n)) is indeed the same as the expression obtained in [30].\n15\n3. Derivation of the k-time span distribution\nFor the k-time span distribution, we need the general expression of the matrices Mm,n(s). We solve the set of partial differential equations (E10) starting at m > 0 to n > m with arbitrary initial conditions (xl(m), xr(m)). Defining x\u0303l(n) \u2261 xl(n) sinh(wn) exp(vn/2D) and x\u0303r(n) \u2261 xr(n) sinh(wn) exp(\u2212vn/2D), we have that{\n\u2202nx\u0303l(n) = wxr(n) \u2202nx\u0303r(n) = wxl(n) . (E15)\nThus, as x\u0303l(m) = xl(m) exp(vm/2D) sinh(wm) and x\u0303r(m) = xr(m) exp(\u2212vm/2D) sinh(wm),xl(n) = w exp(\u2212vn/2D) sinh(wn) (\u222b n m xr(n \u2032)dn\u2032 + w\u22121xl(m) exp(vm/2D) sinh(wm) ) = w exp(\u2212vn/2D)sinh(wn) Xr(n)\nxr(n) = w exp(vn/2D) sinh(wn) (\u222b n m xl(n \u2032)dn\u2032 + w\u22121xr(m) exp(\u2212vm/2D) sinh(wm) ) = w exp(vn/2D)sinh(wn) Xl(n) . (E16)\nThis gives the equation for Xr\n\u2202nXr(n) = (v/2D \u2212 w coth(wn))Xr(n)\u2212 (v/2D \u2212 w coth(wm))Xr(m) + xr(m) (E17) = (v/2D \u2212 w coth(wn))Xr(n) + \u03b1(m) , (E18)\nwhere \u03b1(m) is defined as\n\u03b1(m) \u2261 w\u22121(\u2212v/2D + w coth(wm))xl(m) sinh(wm) exp(vm/2D) + xr(m) . (E19)\nEq. (E18) solution is given by\nXr(n) = \u03b1(m) exp(vn/2D)\nsinh(wn) \u222b n m exp(\u2212vn\u2032/2D) sinh(wn\u2032) +Xr(m) exp(v(n\u2212m)/2D) sinh(wm) sinh(wn) (E20)\nand deriving this expression,\nxr(n) = (v/2D \u2212 w coth(wn)) ( \u03b1(m) exp(vn/2D)\nsinh(wn) \u222b n m exp(\u2212vn\u2032/2D) sinh(wn\u2032)\n+Xr(m) exp(v(n\u2212m)/2D) sinh(wm)\nsinh(wn)\n) + \u03b1(m). (E21)\nWe get the expression for xr(n) as a function of xl(m) and xr(m)\nxr(n) = xr(m)\n( (v/2D \u2212 w coth(wn))exp(vn/2D)\nsinh(wn) \u222b n m exp(\u2212vn\u2032/2D) sinh(wn\u2032)dn\u2032 + 1 )\n+ xl(m)\n[ \u2212 w\u22121(v/2D \u2212 w coth(wn))(v/2D \u2212 w coth(wm))exp(v(m+ n)/2D) sinh(wm)\nsinh(wn) \u00d7 \u222b n m exp(\u2212vn\u2032/2D) sinh(wn\u2032)dn\u2032 \u2212 w\u22121(v/2D \u2212 w coth(wm))(exp(vm/2D) sinh(wm)\n+ w\u22121(v/2D \u2212 w coth(wn))(exp(vm/2D) sinh(wm) exp(\u2212v(n\u2212m)/2D) sinh(wm) sinh(wn)\n] . (E22)\nThe expression for xl(n) is similar and is obtained by reversing the velocity v \u2192 \u2212v and the indices l \u2194 r. Thus we obtain, using (E22), the exact expression of the matrix M(s,m, n)\nM(s,m, n) \u2261 \u00b5(\u2212v,m, n) \u03bd(v,m, n) \u03bd(\u2212v,m, n) \u00b5(v,m, n)  , (E23)\n16\nwith \u00b5(v,m, n) \u2261 1 + (v/2D \u2212 w coth(wn)) ( exp(vn/2D)\nsinh(wn) \u222b n m exp(\u2212vn\u2032/2D) sinh(wn\u2032)dn\u2032 )\n(E24)\n\u03bd(v,m, n) \u2261 e vm/2D sinh(wm)\nw\n[ (v/2D \u2212 w coth(wn)) ( \u2212 v/2D \u2212 w coth(wm)\nsinh(wn)\n\u222b n m e v(n\u2212n\u2032) 2D sinh(wn\u2032)dn\u2032\n+ exp(v(n\u2212m)/2D) sinh(wm)\nsinh(wn)\n) \u2212 (v/2D \u2212 w coth(wm)) ] , (E25)\nand all the s dependence being within the variable w. Hence, the knowledge of Eqs. (E7), (E23), (E24), (E25) give us the full description of the stochastic process {N(t)}, the span of a biased random walk.\nAppendix F: Illustration of Eq. (13) and (14)\nFigure S3. 2-time distribution for the persistent random walk for parameters T = v = 1 and t1, t2 = 10, 30 (a), as well as for a biased random walk of parameters v = 1 and diffusion D = 1, at times t1, t2 = 20, 30 (b). Numerical simulations are represented by the dots.\nWe numerically invert the Laplace transform of the 2\u2212time distributions of a run-and-tumble particle using Eq. (13) and of a biased random walk using Eq. (14) of the main text. As shown in Figure S3, knowledge of the Laplace transformed distributions can be used to extract numerical values of the statistics, besides the theoretical characterization.\n[1] G. H. Vineyard, J.
