    "abstractText": "Through-space charge transfer (CT) process is observed in Cu(I) carbene-metal-amide complexes, where conventional imidazole or imidazoline N-heterocyclic (NHC) carbene fragments act as inert linkers and CT proceeds between a metal-bound carbazole donor and a distantly situated carbene-bound phenylsulfonyl acceptor. The resulting electron transfer gives a rise to efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), characterized with high photoluminescence quantum yields (\u03a6PL up to 90 %) and radiative rates (kr) up to 3.32\u00d710 5 s . TADF process is aided by fast reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) rates of up to 2.56\u00d710 s . Such emitters can be considered as hybrids of two existing TADF emitter design strategies, combining low singlet-triplet energy gaps (\u0394EST) met in all-organic exciplex-like emitters (0.0062\u22120.0075 eV) and small, but non-negligible spin-orbital coupling (SOC) provided by Cu atom, like in TADF-active organometallic complexes.",

The resulting electron transfer gives a rise to efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), characterized with high photoluminescence quantum yields (\u03a6PL up to 90 %) and radiative rates (kr) up to 3.32\u00d710 5 s1. TADF process is aided by fast reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) rates of up to 2.56\u00d7107 s1. Such emitters can be considered as hybrids of two existing TADF emitter design strategies, combining low singlet-triplet energy gaps (\u0394EST) met in all-organic exciplex-like emitters (0.0062\u22120.0075 eV) and small, but non-negligible spin-orbital coupling (SOC) provided by Cu atom, like in TADF-active organometallic complexes."

            "text": "High cost and rarity of transition metals (Ir, Pt, Os and Re) commonly used for synthesis\nof triplet emitters have fueled large research interest in alternative structural approaches. Among those, metal-free organic compounds exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) have received the most attention.1,2 Beside the main focus for applications in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), these compounds have found an extensive use in photocatalysis3 and time-resolved imaging.4 The emission from triplet state in these materials is realized through a reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) process between T1 and S1 levels, provided that singlet-triplet energy gap (\u0394EST) is sufficiently small to be overcome at room temperature. The chemical composition of TADF emitters involves a presence of electron donating (D) and accepting (A) structural fragments, between which the emissive charge-transfer (CT) process takes place. Small \u0394EST in these compounds is achieved by minimizing the overlap between HOMO and LUMO wavefunctions, usually confined on D and A moieties.5 The majority of the studied structural examples feature D-A pairs that are coupled through \u03c0-conjugated bridging fragments, between which orbital overlap-reducing conformational twists are introduced. The necessity for covalent bonding can be abandoned, by applying physical mixtures of D and A components, which form TADF-active exciplexes with ultralow \u0394EST values (< 0.001 eV). 6\u20138 Such systems, however, often suffer from poor photoluminescence quantum yields (\u03a6PL) and wide emission bands due to highly randomized packing patterns of the constituting compounds. The next evolutionary step of TADF emitters introduced so called intramolecular exciplexes, where through-space CT proceeds between covalently bound D and A fragments and through-bond electronic coupling is prevented by \u03c3bonding or multiple conformational twists.9\u201311 While such conformationally rigid materials solve some of the previously mentioned issues, the SOC between 1CT and 3CT states is practically nonexistent due to almost identical orbital configurations and the attainment of a rapid spin flip is often reliant on the aid of closely located local excited triplet states (3LE).12 Hence through-space TADF emitters often suffer from low radiative rates (kr). 13\nOrganometallic complexes bearing the relatively abundant Cu metal atom is a\nconceptually different class of low-cost TADF emitters.14,15 While this element does not provide large enough SOC for fast room-temperature phosphorescence, the values are sufficient enough to promote a rapid TADF, despite the considerable \u0394EST gaps met in such compounds (> 0.05 eV). Recently a new type of highly emissive materials has arisen among\nthis compound class. Exhibiting strongly coupled CT transitions between metal-bound electrophilic carbene and electron-rich amide ligands, these compounds are often referred to as \u201ccarbene-metal-amides\u201d (CMAs).16,17 Due to a favorable electronic level configuration and metal involvement TADF lifetimes below 1.0 \u03bcs can be achieved.18,19\nHere we present a novel approach towards TADF emitters that can be considered as a\nhybrid case between the previously discussed all-organic through-space and metal-assisted designs (Fig. 1). Similarly to the existing CMA emitters, Cu complexes bearing carbazolide and carbene ligands were synthesized. Imidazole-based N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) were used, with electron-accepting sulfonyl groups introduced at 4-position of the N-bound 2,6- diisopropylphenyl (Dipp) substituents (Scheme 1). The strong electron accepting nature of sulfonyls relocates LUMO from the carbene to the perpendicularly aligned Dipp rings, giving a rise to a through-space CT process with the HOMO-hosting carbazolide fragment. The resulting compounds 1\u22124 exhibit unique photophysical behavior, combining low \u0394EST (0.006 eV) with small, but non-negligible SOC due to the presence of Cu atom. These structural examples demonstrate a new design strategy for the development of TADF emitters.\norganic through space CT (a), metal promoted (b) and our presented hybrid (c) approaches.\nScheme 1.

Transmetallation in the presence of CuBr and subsequent reaction with deprotonated carbazole (Cbz) or 1,8-dimethylcarbazole (MeCbz) afforded CMA complexes 1\u22124 as off-white crystalline solids. The detailed synthetic procedures are provided in the Supporting Information. In the crystalline form the compounds are stable and can be stored indefinitely under air exposure. The decomposition temperatures of the complexes vary in the range of 300\u2212315 \u00b0C (Fig. S2).\nScheme 2. Synthetic route of CMA complexes 1\u22124.\nX-ray diffraction analysis was successfully performed for compounds 1 and 4 (Fig. 2).\nAs it is evident from the acquired X-ray structures, the geometry of the complexes is largely affected by the structure of the attached carbazolide ligand. Complex 1 exhibits a nearly linear geometry with a slight bending at Cu (\u2220 C1-Cu-N2 = 182.3\u00b0) and N2 (\u2220 Cu-N2-\"Cbz centroid\" = 177.7\u00b0). The lengths of metal-ligand bonds, C1-Cu (1.857 \u00c5) and Cu-N2 (1.841 \u00c5), are slightly shorter than in the previously reported structural analogue IPr-Cu-Cz featuring unfunctionalized Dipp rings (1.874 and 1.877 \u00c5),30 thus indicating a slightly stronger bonding. The alignment between Cbz and imidazole planes is coplanar, in contrast to IPr-Cu-Cz, where these planes assume a perpendicular configuration. With the introduction of bulkier MeCbz ligand in 4, a steric repulsion between Dipp ring and MeCbz methyls takes place and the linearity of the axis C1-Cu-\"Cbz centroid\" cannot be retained. The structural strain in 4 is mainly relieved by the bending at MeCbz nitrogen (\u2220 Cu-N2-\"Cbz centroid\" = 147.3\u00b0). This process can be related to a formal hybridization change of the carbazolide nitrogen from the typical sp2 to the sp3-like state, as indicated by the apparent structural pyramidalization at N2 atom and by the carbazolide N2-C2 bond lengthening, from 1.374 to 1.406 \u00c5. The release of\nthe sterical strain by the 90\u00b0 rotation of the carbazolide plane, like in several other reported CMAs,17,30,31 in this case is not possible due to the repulsion between the carbazolide methyls and the isopropyl groups of two Dipp fragments. In comparison to complex 1, the interligand bridge in 4 (C1-Cu-N2) is slightly extended (by 0.081 \u00c5).\nTemperature-induced polymorphism is observed for the studied monocrystal of 4. At\nroom temperature conditions the crystal assumes a stable orthorhombic form, while cooling causes a phase transition to a monoclinic polymorph. The temperature dependence of crystal lattice parameters is outlined in Table S2, indicating that the phase transition proceeds at 219 K (Fig. S3). This process is also evident by low-temperature differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements (Fig. S4). It should be noted that the change from the orthorhombic form to the monoclinic occurs without the destruction of the single crystals and X-ray structures of both forms were obtained. Thus, a typical second-order phase transition is observed."

All compounds show\nsimilar voltammetry traces. Oxidation potentials (Eox) vary in a narrow range from -0.06 to - 0.01 V and are assigned to an electron transfer at carbazolide ligands.32 In contrast to Cbzfunctionalized structural analogues, identical anodic shift of about 0.04 V can be observed for MeCbz-bearing compounds 3 and 4, thus indicating a similar electronic configuration that arises due to the sterical overcrowding-induced structural changes. A larger dispersity is observed among the reduction potentials (Ered). Cathodic shift of about 0.15 V is measured for compounds 1 and 2 in comparison to 3 and 4. The fact that this Ered difference cannot be related to the structure of imidazoline or imidazole-based carbene fragments, but again, can be correlated to the attached carbazolide structures, allows us to assume that the observed reduction process is related to electrochemical processes at the metal. This is also indicated by the low electrochemical bandgap. Such electrochemical behavior is common for Cu(I) complexes, for which voltammetry cannot be used to reliably determine LUMO energy levels.33,34 Accordingly, ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple was used as the reference to convert Eox into HOMO, while the LUMO value was subsequently estimated with the use of experimental optical bandgap values (Table S3)."

            "text": "An understanding about the molecular orbital configuration for 1\u22124 is provided by the\nDensity Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The theoretical investigations were performed at the MN15/LACVP** level.26 In a similar fashion to the known CMAs, HOMO is predominantly situated on the carbazolide, with a small (5.8\u22126.1 %) contribution of the metal atom (Fig. 3a, S6; Table S4).18,35,36 LUMO, on the other hand, shows a contrasting behavior. This frontier orbital is relocated from the NHC-ring to the electron deficient diphenylsulfone groups. Because of the orthogonal configuration, LUMO is completely separated from the carbene-forming ring. This creates several distinctions from the previously reported CMAs. First, the calculated LUMOs have negligible metal contribution, in the range of 0.5\u22120.8 %. For the compounds that host LUMO directly on the carbene moiety these values usually reach a considerable level of 7\u221222 %.18,35\u201337 Second, relatively to the HOMO-hosting carbazolide, LUMO has now been shifted to a more distant molecular region. Consequently, very small HOMO-LUMO overlap integrals of (0.05\u22120.08) are calculated for the synthesized structures (Table S3). For CMAs with LUMO-hosting carbene rings this parameter usually exceeds 0.26, as the frontier orbitals are placed closer and share a common metal atom.35,36\nTime-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations were performed to predict the nature and\nenergy level configuration of the excited states of the complexes (Fig. 3b; Table S5). At the ground state (GS) geometry the lowest energy singlet transition (S0\u2192S1) in 1\u22124 has a throughspace interligand CT character and proceeds with an electron transfer between the frontier orbital pair located on carbazolide and the Dipp rings (Fig. 3c, S7). Through-bond electron transfer between the involved molecular fragments in this case is prevented by both, the presence of the bridging metal atom and the orthogonal twist between NHC and diphenylsulfone planes. Consequently, the predicted S0\u2192S1 transitions show relatively small oscillator strength values in the range of 0.0027\u22120.0058. Among the investigated structures the oscillator strength of the S0\u2192S1 transition is around 1.5\u22122 times higher for of MeCbzcontaining compounds 3 and 4. The extent of the electronic coupling in through-space charge transfer chromophores is affected by the spatial alignment of donor and acceptor aromatic ring systems, and face-to-face configuration leads to a much stronger coupling than edge-to-face arrangement.38 As evident by the obtained X-ray (Fig. 2) and DFT-optimized structures, the\ndihedral angle between Cbz and Dipp planes (\u03b3) becomes substantially smaller, if MeCbz ligand is present (in 3 and 4) due to the sterical strain induced bending of the carbazolide plane.\nBecause of a complete spatial separation of the frontier molecular orbitals the predicted\nenergy gaps between S1 and T1 states are low (0.007\u22120.021 eV; Table S5). To evaluate the heavy metal effect on the potential enhancement of ISC and rISC rates, SOC values between S1 and T1 states were calculated for complex 1. Despite the practically identical orbital configuration, a non-zero SOC value of 0.39 cm-1 is predicted at GS geometry. Because Cu atom has practically no contribution to LUMO, the corresponding SOC is by approximately two orders of magnitude lower than the values typical for CMAs with carbazolide-to-NHC CT states.39 Nevertheless, the calculated SOC value can be considered as sufficient to promote a rapid TADF, taking into account the low \u0394EST values. 40 T1 excited state geometries were obtained for 1 and 4. No major structural changes are observed in comparison to GS, except for a slight planarization at C1-Cu-N2 axis, indicating a decreased sterical strain. The excited state configuration at T1 geometry is almost identical to that of GS, with lower excitations being carbazolide-to-Dipp CT states and with no major changes in \u0394EST and SOC values."

In\nanalogy to other CMAs, the structured bands at 300-380 nm interval can be attributed to the 1\u03c0\u03c0* transitions of carbazolide ligands.32 The lowest energy edge of the carbazolide absorption partly overlaps with weaker intensity bands that extend up to 450 nm mark. These spectral features show extinction coefficients in the range of 1000-3000 M-1cm-1 and exhibit a hypsochromic shift with increasing solvent polarity (Fig. 4b). Negative solvatochromism designates the interligand CT nature of the corresponding transitions. Theoretical and experimental investigations of CMAs have related such CT-band property to the inversion in molecular dipole direction upon the photoexcitation.17,41,42\nA correlation between the intensity of CT absorption bands and the structure of the\ncomplexed carbazolide can be made. For the MeCbz-containing complexes 3 and 4 extinction coefficients are by a factor of 2 larger (Fig. 4a, inset), giving the corresponding solutions a yellowish tint, whereas the solutions of Cbz-containing compounds 1 and 2 are practically colorless. This is in agreement with TD-DFT predictions, which designate larger oscillator strength values for 3 and 4 due to the increased coplanarity between the aromatic rings involved in the through-space CT process.\nThe results of photoluminescence (PL) measurements in toluene solutions are outlined\nin Table S6. All compounds show wide and featureless emission bands with maxima at 521\u2212547 nm (Fig. 4c), indicating CT character of the emissive excited states. This is a contrasting behavior to IPr-Cu-Cz and some other related structural analogues, which show structured emission bands due to the phosphorescence from 3LE states.30,31 In agreement with the theoretical predictions, which reveal more stabilized lowest energy CT states for imidazoline-based complexes 2 and 4, these compounds show bathochromic PL shifts of 20\u221224 nm. The PL bands exhibit a characteristic positive solvatochromism, which arises due to the 1CT state stabilization by the solvation shell, as evident by the emission spectra in toluene and\nchlorobenzene (Fig. 4d, S8).32 With further solvent polarity increase (e.g. acetonitrile) the complexes become non-emissive. The emission efficiency of compounds in the dissolved state is relatively low. Among the screened solvents the highest \u03a6PL values are measured in toluene (0.21\u22120.31). As indicated by the rapid non-radiative decay rates (knr), PL efficiency of 1\u22124 in fluid media is strongly affected by a vibrational relaxation. This can be related to the structural specifics of the complexes. Namely, two possible torsional motions can disrupt the emissive donor-acceptor system: the rotation around the carbazolide-metal (NCbz-Cu) and carbene-Dipp (NCarb-CDipp) bonds.\nSimilarly to several other through-space CT emitters,10,43 PL efficiency of 1\u22124\nsubstantially increases, when compounds are dispersed in solid matrix, as the torsional degree of freedom in the molecules is reduced. In doped PMMA films (5 wt% emitter content) all compounds possess large \u03a6PL values in the range of 0.84\u22120.90 (Table 1). Complexes are susceptible to a strong concentration quenching and in the neat films \u03a6PL drops to 0.03\u22120.08. We note that this is a contrasting behavior to the previously reported CMAs possessing carbazolide-to-NHC CT states, which are able to retain relatively high quantum yields even in pure form.32 This difference can be related to the fact that for the CT states involving NHC ring the bulky side groups act as buffer, preventing close contacts between the emissive regions of the molecule, whether for 1\u22124 CT proceeds with the involvement of the peripheral fragments, allowing more pronounced emission quenching. The investigated samples experience notable PL intensity drop, when exposed to oxygen, affirming that the mechanism of the emissive processes involves excited triplet states (Fig. S9). Characteristically for through-space CT emitters, the measured PL bands are wide, with maxima in 472\u2212492 nm interval (Fig. 5a).\ntriexponential functions (Table 1). The fastest decay component in the 6\u221218 ns range is attributed to the prompt fluorescence. While the contribution of this low-lifetime emission\ntowards the total PL intensity is quite small (0.2\u22120.8 %), it still can be well resolved, in comparison to other emissive TADF-active Cu complexes, where the rapid ISC process leads to a complete excitation transfer to the triplet states.18 For 1\u22124 the ISC is limited by the small SOC between S1 and T1 levels. By applying conventional PL kinetics equations used for allorganic TADF emitters,44 we estimate the ISC rate of the complexes (kISC) to vary in the range 5.22\u221216.66\u00d7107 s-1, about two orders of magnitude higher than the radiative rate from the S1 state (Table 1). Delayed emission decays over several \u03bcs and consists of two components with a comparable contribution to total PL intensity: one with 1.43\u22122.50 \u03bcs and other with 4.25\u221210.59 \u03bcs lifetime. The overall radiative rate of the complexes varies in the interval kr =1.25\u22123.32\u00d7105 s-1. An increase by a factor of 2 in kr is evident for MeCbz-functionalized compounds 3 and 4. As discussed previously, this observation can be related to the higher oscillator strength values for the lower energy CT states of these compounds.\nTime resolved PL measurements at 77 K reveal that at low temperature conditions CT\nemission is being accompanied by long-lived 3LE phosphorescence of the carbazolide ligands (Fig. 5c, S10). A similar effect has been observed for other CMAs and is related to the destabilizing effects of the solvation shell in the frozen host matrix, which raises 1CT close to or above 3LE level.17,36 In conformity with this assumption, the temperature scans show a gradual cooling-induced blueshift of the CT bands (Fig. 5d). Interestingly, while Cbz and MeCbz donor fragments show identical phosphorescence spectra in the pure form, in the complexed state the shapes and spectral placement of the 3LE phosphorescence bands exhibit pronounced differences (Fig. S11). This disparity is attributed to the overcrowding-induced change in hybridization of the N atom in MeCbz ligand. In addition, 3LE level in 3 and 4 is slightly destabilized and lays 0.04 eV higher, in theory providing a tool for energy level tuning.\nTo gain an understanding about the delayed emission mechanism of the complexes, PL\nkinetics were investigated in 10\u2212300 K temperature range (Table S7). Compounds 2 and 4 were characterized to assess the impact of carbazolide ligand structure. The intensity of CT emission gradually decreases with the cooling, revealing a behavior that is more in line with all-organic than heavy metal-promoted TADF emitters. In the absence of strong SOC, the emission from 3CT states proceeds at timescale that cannot compete with the nonradiative vibrational relaxation. This means that for such emitters PL intensity drops at low temperatures, as the lack of thermal activation traps the excitation in the dark triplet state.1 For TADF-active Cu complexes the situation is different. The moderate SOC values promote efficient 3CT phosphorescence with typical lifetimes of few hundred \u03bcs, and PL intensity remains practically constant, as with the temperature decrease the dominating emission mechanism gradually shifts from TADF to phosphorescence.33 The behavior of 1\u22124 belongs to the former case. This assumption is additionally supported by TD-DFT calculations, which estimate phosphorescence lifetime from T1 state of 1 to be 0.22 s, too long for this to be a viable emissive pathway. A slight deviation from the beforementioned trend is observed for complex 4, for which the maximal PL efficiency is measured at 220 K (\u03a6PL = 0.93). This is attributed to the cooling induced solidification of the host matrix and consequent suppression of emissionquenching torsional motions.\nThroughout the explored temperature interval, the compounds retain triexponential\ndecay curves, featuring a prompt and two delayed emission components (Fig. 6a,b; Table S7). The temperature-induced changes in emission rate constants for the two long-lived PL constituents provide another direct evidence for TADF process (Fig. 6c,d). For both, the fastest\n(TADF1) and slowest (TADF2) delayed emission components a gradual radiative emission rate (\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc39) decrease is observed throughout the cooling range, designating a thermally activated nature of the emissive process. In contrast, the prompt PL component does not exhibit a rate decrease. The corresponding \u0394EST values were estimated from the fits of Arrhenius plots relating temperature and the experimental \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc39 values (Fig. 6e,f). 18 For the all examined emissive processes highly similar activation energies were obtained, in the range of 0.0062\u22120.0075 eV. These values correspond well with the TD-DFT predictions for the energy gaps between T1 and S1 levels of the carbazolide-to-Dipp related CT states.\nTo explain the origin of two distinct TADF processes for 1\u22124, time-resolved PL spectra were obtained by collecting PL intensities in TADF1 dominated (1\u22122 \u03bcs) and TADF2 (7\u221230 \u03bcs) dominated time intervals (Fig. 6g, S12). Except for complex 4, where PL bands of TADF1 and TADF2 almost overlap, TADF2 is blueshifted in relation to TADF1. This is an opposite behavior to many triplet emitters, where longer lived emissive states usually attain lower energies due to the progressive exciton migration to lower energy states.45 Additionally, the ratio of the PL intensities between TADF1 and TADF2 is temperature dependent (Table S7), and below 50 K the overall CT emission becomes almost completely dominated by TADF2. The beforementioned observations lets us propose a mechanism for the dual TADF (Fig. 6h), attributing each emissive process to an individual structural conformation of the complex molecule. Upon the photoexcitation primarily the CT state associated with TADF2 becomes populated and relaxes to the molecular configuration denoted as Conformation 1. In conformity with low-temperature measurements, the following excitation transfer to the Conformation 2, exhibiting TADF1 emission, is associated with an energetical barrier (\u0394E), even though in the relaxed state it assumes a lower energy than TADF2. The rate \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc391 is by a factor 2 larger than \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc392. As indicated by \u0394EST values obtained for 2, this cannot be explained by a lower activation energy for TADF1, as, in fact, it is lower for TADF2. Accordingly, the rate difference arises due to a substantial oscillator strength increase for 1CT states associated to the Conformation 2. For through-space CT process this can be induced by arranging the D and A fragments closer to the face-to-face configuration. The consequence for such structural change is a characteristic PL redshift,38,46 which, indeed, is observed in the case of TADF1 emission. In terms of structures 1\u22124, this dual emission is thought to be caused by energetic minima that arises due to a possible Renner-Teller distortions, resulting in a decrease in C1-Cu-N2 angle,37,47 or by the pyramidization at carbazolide N atom, like it is observed in the X-ray structure of complex 4. Both these structural changes would shift the plane of carbazolide ligand in a more coplanar arrangement with Dipp fragments.\nIn accordance with the proposed emissive mechanism, the prompt fluorescence arises\nfrom Conformation 1. By assuming that the same emissive 1CT state is involved in TADF2 process, the corresponding rISC rates for 1\u22124 are estimated at 1.21\u22122.56\u00d7107 s-1 (Table 1). In conformity with the hybrid nature of the proposed TADF emitter architecture, these values fall in between the conventional metal-promoted designs (krISC ~ 10 8 s-1)18 and state-of-art allorganic through space emitters (krISC ~ 10 6 s-1).48,49\nTo assess the prospects of the compounds for electroluminescence related applications\nsolution-processed test device were prepared with the architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PolyTPD/4(20wt%):CzSi/TPBi/LiF/Al.

By combining through-space CT architecture, giving compounds the characteristic low \u0394EST values, with the presence of a heavy metal atom, which provides small, but still present SOC, rISC values exceeding 107 s-1 can be attained. While the examined compounds can still be classified as carbene-metal-amide complexes, from the point of photophysical functionality, the carbene fragment acts as an inert linking fragment between a carbene-bound acceptor and a metal-bound donor. In such way conventional and easy to obtain imidazole-based carbenes can serve as building blocks towards such emitters, in contrast to carbene-to-carbazolide CT state emitters, where a careful tuning of carbene electronic levels is necessary.42 Additionally, we demonstrate that a direct metal bonding to only one of the CTconstituting aromatic systems is sufficient to provide a rapid TADF process. Emissive rates in the presented emitters can be substantially increased by ensuring face-to-face alignment between D and A fragments, what can be achieved through sterical overcrowding-induced twist of the carbazolide plane. The presented findings provide valuable guidelines towards further development of TADF-active molecules."
