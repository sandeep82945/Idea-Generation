            "text": "*e concept of job burnout was first put forward by the famous American psychologists Jackson and Maslach in 1984 [13]. In 2001, Maslach summarized that \u201cjob burnout\u201d refers to a kind of comprehensive syndrome characterized by excessive physical and mental consumption and energy exhaustion under long-term work pressure [14]. Studies have shown that there is a high proportion of job burnout and energy exhaustion among managers of petroleum enterprises, which has a negative impact on ensuring the management quality of petroleum enterprises and the\npersonal career development of managers to varying degrees [15, 16]. *e level of emotional exhaustion, emotional alienation, and reduced sense of accomplishment of managers in petroleum enterprises is poor, indicating that managers in petroleum enterprises consume a lot of physical and psychological functions in corporate management work, aggravating their own sense of exhaustion, and reducing their sense of accomplishment causes oil companymanagers to show symptoms such as indifference, hostility, and lack of compassion [17]. Emotional exhaustion and high burnout suggest that the managers of petroleum enterprises have a deep sense of identity for the excessive consumption of their emotional and physiological functions; emotional alienation and high burnout indicate the objective response of managers of petroleum enterprises in enterprise management [18]; the reduced sense of achievement and high burnout indicate that the managers of petroleum enterprises no longer have enthusiasm for their work, their self-perception ability decreases, and they are more inclined to take care of their own negative critics [19, 20]. Existing research results reflect the current situation of psychological health and job burnout of managers in petroleum enterprises to a certain extent, revealing that job burnout is significantly positively correlated with mental health status, and mental health level can be used to predict the occurrence of job burnout [21]. *erefore, it is necessary to pay more attention to the managers in petroleum enterprises, enhance their career sense of achievement, and balance the relationship between life and work of the managers in petroleum enterprises, pay attention to the physical and mental health of managers in petroleum enterprises, create a harmonious working atmosphere between managers and ordinary employees in petroleum enterprises, and reduce the job burnout of managers in petroleum enterprises [22, 23]. *e job burnout of the managers in petroleum enterprises will also bring a lot of negative effects to the society [24].\nEducational background\nSenior high school and below 3 1.27 Junior college 40 16.95\nRegular college course 152 64.41 Master degree or above 41 17.37\nSmoking status No smoking or occasional smoking in the last one year 125 52.97Smoking frequently in the past year 111 47.03\nAlcohol consumption status Not drinking in the last year 82 34.75Drinking frequently in the past year 154 62.25\nExercise status Never exercise or exercise occasionally 142 60.17Exercise regularly 94 39.83\nRE TR AC TE D *is study showed that (1) Among the 236management personnel in petroleum enterprises, 212 (89.83%) were male and 24 (10.17%) were female.*e average age was (40.28\u00b1 7.07) years old, and the number of people aged 40\u201349 was the largest, accounting for 52.12%; 84.32% were in marriage; regular college or above accounted for 81.78%; no smoking or occasional smoking in the last one year was 52.97%; not drinking in the last year was 34.75%; and 60.17% of managers in petroleum enterprises never or occasionally exercise.

            "text": "Primarily in this paper, we have thoroughly investigated the psychological status and job burnout of managers in petroleum enterprises. For this purpose, we have assumed managers in petroleum enterprises as the research objects, whereas the overall sampling method was adopted from January 2019 to June 2020. A total of 240 questionnaires were sent out and 236 valid questionnaires were received with a recovery rate of 98.33%. *e research objects\u2019 general information, psychological health status, and job burnout level were investigated. Among the 236 management personnel in petroleum enterprises, 212 (89.83%) were male and 24 (10.17%) were female. *e average age was (40.28\u00b1 7.07)\nyears old, and the number of people aged 40\u201349 was the largest, accounting for 52.12%; 84.32% were in marriage; regular college or above accounted for 81.78%; no smoking or occasional smoking in the last one year was 52.97%; not drinking in the last year was 34.75%; and 60.17% of managers in petroleum enterprises never or occasionally exercise. 121 (51.27%) suffered from high burnout due to emotional exhaustion, 125 (52.97%) suffered from high burnout due to emotional alienation, and 139 (58.90%) suffered from high burnout due to reduced sense of achievement. *e scores of somatization, obsessive symptoms, depression, anxiety, and terror of the respondents were significantly higher than the normal levels of domestic adults. *e differences were statistically significant (P< 0.05); there was no statistical significance in the scores of the other four factors compared with the national norm (P> 0.05). In conclusion, the phenomenon of job burnout and some psychological health problems existed in the managers in petroleum enterprises. *e incidence of psychological evaluation was higher than that of the national norm, and the level of psychological health could predict the job burnout of petroleum enterprise managers."
