This paper presents the X-ray crystallographic structure of the N-methylated teixobactin analogue N-Me-D-Gln4,Lys10teixobactin (1). N-Methylation at position 4 prevents uncontrolled aggregation and enables the crystallization of the teixobactin analogue. Lysine at position 10 replaces the non-proteinogenic amino acid allo-enduracididine, which is not commercially available. Crystallization from aqueous solution with MgCl2 and PEG3350 afforded crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography. The crystallographic phases were solved using SAD phasing on data sets collected at 2.0663 \u00c5. Molecular replacement then enabled the determination of the structure at 1.50 \u00c5 resolution using a data set collected at 0.9997\u00c5 (PDB 8U78). Eight peptide molecules comprise the asymmetric unit, with each peptide molecule binding a chloride anion through hydrogen bonding with the amide NH group of residues 7, 8, 10, and 11. The peptide molecules form hydrogen-bonded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet dimers in the crystal lattice, with residues 1\u20133 comprising the dimerization interface. The dimers further assemble end-to-end in the crystal lattice. The \u03b2-sheet dimers are amphiphilic, with the side chains of the hydrophobic residues on one surface and the side chains of the hydrophilic residues on the other surface. The dimers pack in the lattice through hydrophobic interactions between the hydrophobic surfaces. The crystal structure of teixobactin analogue 1 recapitulates several aspects of the interaction of teixobactin with the cell membrane of Grampositive bacteria, including anion binding, supramolecular assembly through \u03b2-sheet formation, and hydrophobic interactions."

            "text": "Teixobactin is a peptide antibiotic that exhibits remarkable efficacy against Gram-positive\nbacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumonia, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci. 1 Teixobactin\u2019s mode of action involves binding to lipid II and related peptidoglycan precursors and disrupting the bacterial cell membrane. Teixobactin is an undecapeptide consisting of an N-terminal linear tail encompassing residues 1 to 7 and a C-terminal macrocyclic ring spanning residues 8 to 11 (Figure 1). The linear tail consists of N-Me-D-Phe1, Ile2, Ser3, D-Gln4, D-allo-Ile5, Ile6, and Ser7, and the macrocyclic ring consists of D-Thr8, Ala9, the cyclic arginine analogue allo-End10, and Ile11. The C-terminus of Ile11 and the hydroxy group of D-Thr8 form an ester bond, creating 13-membered lactone ring.\nSupramolecular assembly is central to the mechanism of action of.2,3 Two teixobactin\nmolecules come together to form an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet dimer which binds the pyrophosphate group of lipid II. The N-terminal tails comprise the dimerization interface and adopt a conformation in which the residues N-Me-D-Phe1, Ile2, D-allo-Ile5, and Ile6 form a hydrophobic surface that interacts with the bacterial cell membrane. Further supramolecular assembly leads to clustering of lipid II and lysis of Gram-positive bacteria.\nOur laboratory has pioneered the use of X-ray crystallography to gain insights into the\nstructure and supramolecular interactions of teixobactin. Although teixobactin itself is highly\nprone to amyloid-like aggregation and cannot be crystallized, our laboratory has found that Nmethylation at D-Gln4 blocks aggregation and permits crystallization. The resulting N-methylated teixobactin analogues exhibit little or no antibiotic activity. We previously observed that teixobactin analogue 2 undergoes supramolecular assembly to form antiparallel \u03b2-sheet dimers that bind sulfate anions and further form fibril-like assemblies (PDB 6E00).4 We have also observed antiparallel \u03b2-sheet dimers in the X-ray crystallographic structure of teixobactin analogue 3, and we have observed that these dimers bind chloride anions (PDB 6PSL).5 We have further observed chloride anion binding in the X-ray crystallographic structure of truncated teixobactin analogue 4 (CCDC 1523518).6 In the current study, we report the X-ray crystallographic structure of teixobactin analogue 1 and describe its supramolecular interactions in the crystal state. RESULTS\nThe X-ray crystallographic structure of teixobactin analogue 1 reveals eight peptide\nmolecules in the asymmetric unit, with each peptide molecule binding a chloride anion (Figure 2). The eight peptide molecules adopt similar conformations, with a backbone RMSD of 0.58 \u00c5. Each peptide molecule forms an amphiphilic surface in which the side chains of N-Me-D-Phe1, Ile2, Dallo-Ile5, Ile6, Ile11, and the \u03b2-methyl of D-Thr8 create a hydrophobic surface and the side chains of residues Ser3, N-Me-D-Gln4, Ser7, and Lys10 create a hydrophilic surface. The carbonyl groups of the macrocycle align, and the amide NH groups of Ser7, D-Thr8, Lys10, and Ile11 hydrogen bond to chloride anion. The oxygen atom comprising the ester linkage also faces toward the chloride ion. The amide NH group of Ala9 hydrogen bonds to the hydroxy group of Ser7.\nThe peptide molecules form hydrogen-bonded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet dimers in the crystal\nlattice (Figure 3). In each dimer, residues 1\u20133 come together through hydrogen bonding interactions to create the antiparallel \u03b2-sheet structure. The N-methyl groups of N-Me-D-Gln4 point outward from the hydrogen-bonding interface. The dimer is amphiphilic, with the top surface shown in Figure 3 being hydrophilic and the bottom surface being hydrophobic.\nThe dimers further assemble end-to-end in the crystal lattice, as illustrated in Figure 4. In this arrangement, the macrocycle of each molecule is in contact with the N-terminus of another molecule in the adjacent dimer, with the carbonyl group of Ala9 hydrogen bonding to the Nmethylammonium group. Two macrocycles are in proximity at each interface between dimers, with the bound chloride anions ca. 7 \u00c5 apart. The end-to-end assembly of dimers is amphiphilic, and the hydrophobic surfaces pack together in the crystal lattice."

In the antiparallel \u03b2-sheet dimer of teixobactin analogue 1, residues 1\u20133 hydrogen bond, with N-Me-D-Phe1 pairing with Ser3. Analogue 2 also forms an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet dimer,\nbut there is more overlap of the strands, with residues 1\u20136 forming the dimer interface (PDB 6E00). The dimers further assemble through antiparallel \u03b2-sheet interactions involving residues 3\u20137 of their outer edges. Analogue 3 forms an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet dimer, with residues 3\u20135 forming the dimer interface (PDB 6PSL). In the dimers formed by analogues 2 and 3, the N-terminus of one peptide molecule helps bind the anion that is grasped by the C-terminal region of the other molecule. In the dimers formed by analogue 1, however, only the C-terminal region participates in anion binding. The dimers of analogues 1 and 2 further assemble in the lattice to create amphiphilic sheets that pack through hydrophobic interactions. The dimers of analogue 3 further assemble through hydrophobic interactions to create three-fold symmetrical rods that extend through the crystal lattice."

            "text": "Despite these differences, similarities exist across all of the X-ray crystallographic\nstructures that we have determined. The analogues 1\u20133 each come together through antiparallel \u03b2sheet interactions to create amphiphilic \u03b2-sheet dimers. The dimerization of these analogues likely reflects the propensity of teixobactin to form dimers and higher order assemblies that interact with bacterial cell membranes through hydrophobic interactions. Analogues 1\u20133 and truncated analogue 4 (CCDC 1523518) each bind anions in the crystal state, with analogues 1, 3, and 4 binding chloride and analogue 2 binding sulfate. The binding of these anions likely reflects the propensity of teixobactin to bind the pyrophosphate groups of lipid II and related cell wall precursors.\nSupramolecular assembly is integral to the mechanism of action of teixobactin. N-\nMethylation at D-Gln4 helps prevent uncontrolled aggregation, permits crystallization of teixobactin analogues, and allows observation of conformation and supramolecular interactions at atomic resolution. In the crystal state, the teixobactin analogues adopt an amphiphilic conformation and form antiparallel \u03b2-sheet dimers though hydrogen bonding between the Nterminal tails. The macrocycles formed by residues 8\u201311 bind anions through hydrogen bonding. The hydrophobic surfaces of the dimers further pack through hydrophobic interactions. These observations further support a model in which teixobactin binds to Gram-positive bacteria through interactions of its hydrophobic side chains with the bacterial cell membrane, undergoes supramolecular assembly through \u03b2-sheet interactions, and binds the pyrophosphate groups of lipid II and related cell-wall precursors."

HPLC grade acetonitrile (MeCN) and deionized water (18 M\u03a9) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were used as solvents for both preparative and analytical reverse-phase HPLC. Deionized water (18 M\u03a9) was obtained from a Barnstead NANOpure Diamond purification system or a ThermoScientific Barnstead GenPure Pro water purification system.

Synthesis and crystallization of N-Me-D-Gln4,Lys10-teixobactin (1).\nWe synthesized N-Me-D-Gln4,Lys10-teixobactin (1) as the trifluoroacetate (TFA) salt as\ndescribed. 7 Crystallization was performed using standard protein crystallography techniques. Briefly, N-Me-D-Gln4,Lys10-teixobactin (1) was dissolved in 18 M\u03a9 deionized H2O at a concentration of 20 mg/mL. Suitable crystallization conditions were identified by screening experiments in a 96-well plate format with the aid of using screening kits from Hampton Research\n(including PEG/Ion, Index, and Crystal Screen kits). Each well was loaded with 100 \u03bcL of solution from the kits. Hanging drops were set up using a TTP Labtech Mosquito liquid handling instrument, with three 150-nL drops per well, with 1:1, 1:2, and 2:1 ratios of well solution and peptide stock solution. Crystals grew in conditions containing chloride with PEG3350 as precipitant.\nTo optimize crystal growth, we tested various conditions that included PEG3350 and\nMgCl2. In this optimization process, we varied the concentrations of PEG3350 (from 15% to 30%) and MgCl2 (from 0.20 M to 0.38 M) across a 4 \u00d7 6 matrix within a Hampton VDX 24-well plate. Hanging drops for the optimization experiments were prepared on glass slides by combining 1 or 2 \u03bcL of the N-Me-D-Gln4,Lys10-teixobactin solution with 1 or 2 \u03bcL of the well solution, using ratios of 1:1, 2:1, and 1:2. Crystals were assessed for X-ray diffraction using a Rigaku Micromax007 HF diffractometer equipped with a Cu anode. X-ray data collection and processing Data collection was conducted using the BOS/B3 software at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) on beamline 8.2.2. We collected X-ray diffraction at the longest wavelength possible (2.0663 \u00c5, 6000 eV) to allow the use of chloride K-edge X-ray absorption (2822 eV) for single anomalous diffraction (SAD) phasing. Three data sets were acquired from three different crystals. Two sets of 360 images were acquired per crystal, with 1.0\u00b0 rotation intervals (equivalent to two complete 360\u00b0 rotations). The data sets were processed using XDS8, and the resulting data sets were merged employing BLEND9. To determine the structure, we used SAD phasing, implementing the Hybrid Substructure Search (HySS)10 module from the Phenix suite11.The anomalous signals from the chloride ions were used in this process. Initial electron density maps were generated by incorporating the chloride coordinates as starting positions in Autosol12. We also collected a higher-resolution data set at 0.9997 \u00c5 wavelength to allow the use of the molecular replacement\nwith the structure determined from the 2.0663 \u00c5 data. X-ray diffraction data collection and processing information is summarized in Table S1. X-ray structure solution and refinement The structure was refined using Phenix.refine13, and Coot14 was used for model building. During refinement, all B-factors were refined isotropically, and coordinates for hydrogen atoms were generated geometrically. For the non-proteinogenic amino acids (N-Me-D-Gln4, D-Thr8, and Dallo-Ile5), bond lengths, angles, and torsion restraints were generated using eLBOW15 in the Phenix software. The resulting structure was successfully used for molecular replacement with the 0.9997 \u00c5 resolution data set, which was refined in a similar fashion. Pentaethylene glycol dimethyl ether was included in the refinement to fill electron density associated with PEG3350. Final refinement and validation statistics are shown in Table S2 (PDB 8U78).
