 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the impact of different types of family micro-business resources (e.g. financial, human, social, etc.) on agritourism performance. The current study focused only on business-based resources. 

2. Investigate the role of resident-micro-business interaction and support for agritourism development in other tourism contexts beyond agritourism, such as eco-tourism, cultural tourism, etc.

3. Conduct a comparative study on the relationships between micro-businesses, residents, and tourism performance in developed vs developing countries. The current study was done in Saudi Arabia, a developing country.

4. Explore the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the tested relationships, since the current data was collected post-pandemic. A pre-post pandemic comparison could yield interesting insights. 

5. Examine the sequential mediation model using more advanced statistical techniques like structural equation modeling (SEM) to further validate the findings. The current study utilized PLS-SEM.
