Expansion to Other CLIs and Programming Languages: Investigate the applicability and adaptability of the developed model to other command-line interfaces and programming languages beyond Azure PowerShell. This could include popular shells like Bash, Zsh, and scripting languages like Python or JavaScript. Such research would significantly enhance the utility of sensitive data redaction across a broader range of computing environments and applications.

Improvement of NLP Techniques for CLI Data: Develop advanced natural language processing techniques specifically tailored for CLI data, which often lacks conventional grammar and structure found in natural language texts. This could involve creating new models or algorithms that better understand the unique syntax and semantics of CLI commands and responses, potentially leading to more accurate identification and redaction of sensitive information.

Real-time Redaction in Live Environments: Explore the development of methods and systems for real-time redaction of sensitive information in live command-line environments. This would require the model to operate with low latency to not disrupt the user experience while ensuring the security and privacy of sensitive information during interactive sessions.

Model Generalization Across Different Cloud Environments: Extend the research to test and improve the model's generalization capabilities across different cloud environments and services, such as AWS CLI, Google Cloud CLI, and others. This could help in creating a universally applicable solution for sensitive data redaction that is not limited to a specific vendor or platform.

User Feedback and Continuous Learning: Implement a feedback loop from users (DRIs) into the machine learning model to continuously improve its accuracy and effectiveness over time. This could involve mechanisms for users to report false positives/negatives and for the model to learn from these inputs, adapting to new types of sensitive information and changing data protection requirements.
