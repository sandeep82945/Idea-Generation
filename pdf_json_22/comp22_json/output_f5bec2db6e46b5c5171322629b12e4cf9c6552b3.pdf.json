    "abstractText": "The development and rollout of COVID-19 vaccination around the world offers hope for controlling the pandemic. People turned to social media such as Twitter seeking information or to voice their opinion. Therefore, mining such conversation can provide a rich source of data for different applications related to the COVID-19 vaccine. In this data article, we developed an Arabic Twitter dataset of 1.1 M Arabic posts regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. The dataset was streamed over one year, covering the period from January to December 2021. We considered a set of crawling keywords in the Arabic language related to the conversation about the vaccine. The dataset consists of seven databases that can be analyzed separately or merged for further analysis. The initial analysis depicts the embedded features within the posts, including hashtags, media, and the dynamic of replies and retweets. Further, the textual analysis reveals the most frequent words that can capture the trends of the discussions. The dataset was designed to facilitate research across different fields, such as social network analysis, information retrieval, health informatics, and social science.

            "text": "Social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram can be a powerful source of data [1]. In recent years, Twitter has been considered a popular source for news broadcasting, marketing, advertising, emerging technologies, global events, and politics [2]. Millions of users use Twitter to interact and exchange news and information. Recently, Twitter had 217 million daily active users who post 500 million tweets a day [3]. Twitter is not only a platform for users to socially interact and maintain social ties, but it has become a communication channel between organizations and society. Leaders, government organizations, and institutions communicate with society through their posts [4,5]. Moreover, conversations on Twitter regarding an evolving topic can offer a great opportunity for investigating people\u2019s opinions and understanding their behaviors. Such understanding can help governments and organizations in decision- and policy-making. The role of social networks, and in particular Twitter, during crises or pandemics has provoked interest among researchers and experts. The data content can provide important insights into the management and analysis of crises, such as Ebola [6] and the seasonal influenza epidemics [7]. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a significant increase in the number of posts on Twitter related to this pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) used Twitter as a communication channel to inform people about the coronavirus and vaccination, to prevent false or fake information [8]. Further, the conversation about the COVID-19 pandemic has drawn people\u2019s attention over the world, and people have turned to Twitter to share their opinion and look for information [9]. The development and production of vaccines [10] offered a potential solution to controlling the pandemic. Most vaccine distribution campaigns started on December 2020 [11]. The spread of vaccine information that can impact vaccine uptake can be significantly increased with\nData 2022, 7, 152. https://doi.org/10.3390/data7110152 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/data\nData 2022, 7, 152 2 of 17\nthe wide usage of social media [12]. Therefore, studying and understanding the content of social media around vaccinations can shape public opinion. Mining the content of social media to develop datasets, particularly tweeted conversations, has gained considerable attention from the scientific community in different fields, such as data mining, machine learning, natural language processing, big data analysis, and social network analysis. In public health, using Twitter to carry out research has increased significantly. Hence, developing tweet datasets to be used by researchers will enrich the research in this field. Recent work developed data on drug safety [13], inflammatory bowel disease [14], and personal health information [15]. As the surge of COVID-19 started, considerable efforts have been made to develop a multilingual Twitter dataset related to coronavirus [16\u201318]. Arabic posts were also collected to develop Arabic datasets [19,20] regarding COVID-19. Although there have been several works on Twitter datasets of COVID-19 vaccination, they are confined to some aspects covering vaccine misinformation detection [21,22], vaccine stance [23], or sentiment analysis [24,25]. Despite Arabic being one of the most dominant languages on Twitter [26], few studies have developed a COVID-19 vaccine tweet dataset. Also, to the best of our knowledge prior works on developing an Arabic dataset related to the COVID-19 vaccine focus on developing labeled datasets for a specific purpose such as detecting vaccine misinformation or sentiment analysis. To address this limitation, we developed a Twitter conversation dataset related to the COVID-19 vaccine with a focus on Arabic tweets only. The aim of this work is to explore and analyze the dynamics of the conversations on Twitter regarding the vaccine to develop a dataset that could be used in the investigation of different research topics. The contribution of this research is threefold:\n1. We build an Arabic Twitter dataset of 1.1 M Arabic posts that was streamed over one year, covering the period from January to December 2021. The data collection started when most countries around the world started the COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. Thus, the dataset covers the initial dynamic conversation on vaccine distribution. 2. We performed a preliminary analysis on the raw data which revealed topical insights and resulting in seven database tables. Further analysis can be done among multiple database tables. 3. We release the dataset to be freely available to the research community in the Mendeley data repository https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zmwfnsms9n (accessed on 31 October 2022). The dataset can be useful for researchers in different fields to analyze people\u2019s activity following the first announcement of the vaccine distribution or to perform comparative analysis. Moreover, scientific communities, public health agencies, and analysts might be interested in this dataset to obtain insights, make decisions, or design strategies that might help in some potential situations\nThe rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of recent works. Section 3 provides the description of the dataset. A detailed description of the developing method of the dataset is presented in Section 4. Section 5 contains the results and analysis. A brief description of the potential research application of the dataset is presented in Section 6. The conclusion is presented in Section 7."

            "text": "During the pandemic, social media platforms played an important role in informing the public and spreading information. These channels provide timely and reliable data that can be valuable for mining and investigating the public\u2019s stance. Consequently, several studies have developed Twitter post datasets related to the coronavirus or vaccination in different languages. Singh et al. [16] collected 2.79 M tweets from 16 January to 15 March 2020. The tweets include multilingual conversations related to COVID-19. They used two datasets, the first one made up of tweets with location mentions and the second comprising geotagged tweets. They performed a cross-correlation analysis between the two datasets and data from the WHO. They found that the conversations were highly correlated with the confirmed cases of COVID-19. They suggested that the tweeted conversations may be a\nData 2022, 7, 152 3 of 17\nleading guide to the cases. Then, they analyzed the content of the English tweets to identify themes and the predominant myths. Another study by Chen et al. [17] collected and analyzed over 72 M tweets from 21 January to 21 March 2020. The dataset includes multilingual COVID-19 Twitter posts. They performed an initial analysis including hashtags, languages, and verified users. They found that hashtag usage increased when COVID-19 was declared a global public health emergency. Their analysis showed that the most active accounts are news and political accounts. Recently, Aguilar et al. [18] gathered 8.98 M Twitter posts over 23 days that reflect the early discussion about coronavirus. The dataset is multilingual with a focus on English, Portuguese, and Spanish languages. They developed different databases including, hashtags, links and media, and retweets. Also, they classified tweets into different types based on whether they were original tweets, retweets, with mention, or without. Their analysis showed that the most retweeted tweets belong to accounts such as news media, politicians, actors, official institutes, and activists. A multilingual COVID-19 Twitter dataset covering 268 countries was presented by Abdul-Mageed et al. [27]. The billion-scale dataset was classified as pandemic-relevant tweets or misinformation. For classification, they used two predictive models. They trained a COVID-relevant classifier using a sample of multilingual tweets developed by [14] and considered them as the positive class. To train the misinformation detection model, they used two publicly available datasets as a positive class. This pandemic has drawn the interest of users who are writing in the Arabic language to become involved in discussions that cover a range of topics related to the coronavirus. Haouari et al. [19] collected about 2.7 M Arabic posts regarding COVID-19 for a year. The data covers the topic in Arab countries, and it includes the tweets and propagation networks of the most 1000 popular tweets. They performed a preliminary analysis of the tweets and user distribution that revealed temporal information and geographical aspects. Further analysis of trending topics discovered a considerable relationship between the frequency peak and the first reported case of the disease. An annotated tweet dataset was developed by Elhadad et al. [20] and contains Arabic and English tweets to detect misleading tweets related to COVID-19. The tweets were annotated using automatically different machine learning techniques and several feature extraction techniques. Another study by Haouari et al. [28] covered 9.4 K labeled tweets and their propagation networks related to the detection of misinformation and rumors about COVID-19. They used an Arabic BERT-based model to classify tweets based on two levels of misinformation detection. Alam et al. in [29] released a 16-K tweet dataset in multiple languages that focused on COVID-19. The dataset was manually annotated for disinformation analysis. Through annotation, the authors determined if the tweets contained accurate claims and their potential for causing harm. They used a training model for each language, and then multilingual training was performed for the data in all languages. An annotated dataset of 10 K Arabic and English tweets was developed by Yang et al. [30] for sentiment analysis. They categorized the tweets into 10 classes using multi-label classifiers based on deep neural network models. The analysis showed that the positive sentiment increased over time. Alsudias et al. [31] collected a dataset of 1 M Arabic tweets about COVID-19. Then, they performed an annotation process for rumor detection on a random sample of the tweets. They applied three machine learning techniques with two sets of features to classify the tweets into false, correct, or unrelated tweets. Further, they performed an analysis to predict the source of the tweets regarding COVID-19. More recently, several studies analyzed and provided tweet datasets about the COVID-19 vaccine. A dataset developed by Zhou et al. [32] called ReCOVery includes about 2000 news articles with 140 K tweets related to this news to predict reliable and unreliable news. For the prediction task, they used a neural network model. They found that 60 percent of the news was identified as extremely high or low in credibility. Then they tracked the news on Twitter through their URLs. Their dataset includes multimodal information from news articles. Malagoli et al. [25] collected about 12 M tweets over two months during the early stage of\nData 2022, 7, 152 4 of 17\nvaccination. They performed sentiment and psycholinguistic analysis to investigate user engagement. For sentiment analysis, they identified the strength of positive and negative opinions. Further, they studied the psycholinguistic property of the tweets to identify users\u2019 communication using the Word Count lexicon technique. Research by Muric et. al. [33] presented a Twitter dataset in English on anti-vaccine sentiments. They collected the historical tweets of accounts that engaged in antivaccination conversations. They performed an initial descriptive analysis, such as hashtag frequency and detecting the source of the news. In addition, they produced a geographical analysis of the tweets. Similarly, a Twitter dataset in English was presented by DeVerna et al. [34]. They performed descriptive analysis for one week of extracted Twitter posts about the COVID-19 vaccine. The analysis includes hashtag clusters and geographical distribution of the tweets. Moreover, the authors present a visualization of the statistical data through a data dashboard. Hu et al. [24] collected over 300 K tweets in the US related to COVID-19 vaccines. Using spatiotemporal patterns, they investigated the sentiments and emotions of the public over time. For sentiment analysis, they used a rule-based model, whereas for emotion analysis the lexicon base was used. Further analysis was performed using topic modeling and word cloud mapping. Another work by Memon et al. [22] proposed a misinformation tweets dataset related to the COVID-19 vaccine. The dataset distinguishes the users who post truthful information and the others who spread misinformation. They used several machine learning and deep learning algorithms. They performed two labeling steps, manual annotation and then validation by a medical expert. The ArCovidVac dataset introduced by Mubarak et al. [23] annotated a 10-K Arabic tweet dataset. Informativeness analysis and stance towards vaccination across an Arab country were presented. The tweets are annotated based on their stance on the vaccination process into a pro-, against vaccination, or neutral stance. Then, they explore the content of the annotated tweets for topics, hashtags, and source of the tweet. Further analysis was performed to investigate the public stance over time. Table 1 summarizes the recent works on COVID-19 and vaccine datasets.\nData 2022, 7, 152 5 of 17\nAll the mentioned developed datasets related to COVID-19 vaccination mainly focused on rumor detection, misinformation detection, vaccine hesitancy, or sentiment analysis. Moreover, there is a limitation on publicly available Arabic datasets regarding COVID-19 vaccine. Therefore, we develop an Arabic twitter posts dataset targeting the vaccination discussion regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. We presented a basic analysis that shows the dynamic of vaccination-related conversation."

We conduct two phases of preprocessing, including the exclusion of irrelevant tweets and cleaning the text of the tweets. We excluded repeated posts and tweets that contain less the three words, due to insufficient content. Then, we carried out tweet text preprocessing. We first extracted the tweets\u2019 text for each month, then we performed cleaning steps on the tweets\u2019 text that are important for eliminating noisy, incomplete, and uninformative data. Therefore, we applied the following steps using the NLTK Python library [37]:\nRemove the URL from the text Remove the mentions (@user) Remove the hashtags Replace the repeated letters with one letter. Remove stop words in the Arabic language such as pronouns, articles, prepositions, etc. Remove punctuation such as commas, brackets, and full stops. Replace emojis with special tokens."

We started by partitioning the remainder of the collected data after the preprocessing by date. Then, we performed different types of analysis on the data. Firstly, we computed some characteristics of the data as shown in Table 3. Secondly,\nData 2022, 7, 152 14 of 17\nwe carried out a content analysis, including trending hashtags, sharing media, the time series of retweets and replies, and the most active users. In the following, we will describe the implementation and the analysis in detail. A hashtag is a phrase starting with a hash symbol (#); using hashtags on Twitter allows users to engage in conversations about specific topics or trends. Hence, we created a hashtag database called \u201cD3.Hashtag\u201d as described in Table 2. In this dataset, 26.22% of the tweets (about 288,803) include one or more hashtags. However, we filtered the unique hashtags, and 94,407 were used more than one time. To extract the most frequent hashtags, we counted the occurrence of each unique hashtag in the whole corpus, then we selected the top 50 hashtags. Twitter allows users to embed media such as photos and videos in their posts, features that can increase the chance of the post being retweeted [38]. To identify the tweets that embed photos or videos, we created a database called \u201cD2.Media\u201d, as shown in Table 2. We extracted the tweets that include media such as images or videos, then we filtered 223,434 tweets that contain at least one media. Next, we grouped each type of media in one cluster to find which is the most shared. To inspect the time series of sharing media, we counted their numbers each month. The discussion on Twitter around different topics is enriched by a lot of interactions through retweets and replies to tweets. To create the retweet dataset, we extracted the tweets that had been retweeted, and then we counted the number of retweets for each tweet to construct the database called \u201cD5.Retweet\u201d, as shown in Table 2. The same process was applied to create the database \u201cD4.Reply\u201d. Both databases contain the date and time that the tweet was either retweeted or replied to. The dataset includes 344,328 unique users who posted 1.10 M tweets. To investigate the more active users in terms of the number of tweets, we first extracted the unique users and created the database \u201cD7.Users\u201d, as shown in Table 2. Then, we counted their posts through the entire period of our dataset. Subsequently, the 20 most active users were extracted and their countries located. To look at the conversation taking place on Twitter regarding vaccination, we explored the content of the tweets by identifying the most frequent words. We excluded the set of the keywords that were used for extracting the corpus since it was expected to be highly frequent. To achieve this, we first counted the words in each month, then we extracted the words that occur more than 5000 times. Next, the top 20 terms were filtered for each month. Further, we selected the 10 most frequent terms over the whole period."

Therefore, this dataset offers a view of the dynamic of the vaccine conversation on Twitter. The dataset of 1.1 M Arabic posts is expected to help research in different fields such as data mining, natural language processing, social analysis, and healthcare. We expected that the data may be useful for several potential applications including but not limited to, social analytics, misinformation detection, and crisis management, as presented below: Social analytics: social investigation analysis includes sentiment analysis, developing topic modeling, stance detection, monitoring retweet patterns, detecting sarcasm, hate speech, and many other applications. Misinformation detection: with the fast development of the vaccine, many rumors are spread and have people\u2019s attention across the globe, which causes the spread of false information about vaccination. The dataset can support research on rumor detection, claims credibility, and community detection in retweets networks to identify fake news and vaccine stances. Crisis Management: since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, health organizations around the world need to analyze information on the pandemic and gather information related to the disease and vaccination for analysis and thus obtain important\nData 2022, 7, 152 15 of 17\ninsight.

            "text": "In this paper, we presented an Arabic Twitter dataset about the COVID-19 vaccine that offers the first look at the dynamics of vaccine conversation on Twitter. We performed a preliminary analysis that characterized the data in several ways, including trending hashtags, prominent terms, and time series of embedded media. Our results provide implications and insights into the dynamic of vaccine conversation on Twitter. First, the results show that hashtags are associated with a positive or negative stance on the vaccine, suggesting that we can understand people\u2019s opinions regarding vaccination distribution. Second, the timeline of retweeting and replying indicates how people are communicating about vaccination. Third, we can discover from the most dominant terms that the conversation continues to grow as the debate continues about vaccination. The dataset can be a source of data that facilitates research in different areas, including health informatics, topic modeling, natural language processing, social network analysis, information retrieval, and social science. In the future, we intend to update the data with newly collected tweets and to perform more in-depth analysis. We are currently working on investigating the content of the conversation to detect the side effects of different types of vaccines reported by people. We also plan to explore the relationship between the Twitter conversation and its effects on public health. Finally, we plan to model vaccination community detection.\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\nInstitutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable.\nInformed Consent Statement: Not applicable.\nData Availability Statement: The data presented in this study are publicly available on Mendeley Data at: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zmwfnsms9n (accessed on 31 October 2022).\nConflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest.\nReferences 1.
