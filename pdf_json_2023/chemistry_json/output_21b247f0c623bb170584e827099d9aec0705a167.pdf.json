    "abstractText": "A pyridine-tricarboxylic acid, 5-(3\u2032,5\u2032-dicarboxylphenyl)nicotinic acid (H3dpna), was employed as a adjustable block to assemble a series of coordination polymers under hydrothermal conditions. The seven new coordination polymers were formulated as [Co(\u03bc3-Hdpna)(\u03bc-dpey)]n\u00b7nH2O (1), [Zn4.5(\u03bc6-dpna)3(phen)3]n (2), [Co1.5(\u03bc6-dpna)(2,2-bipy)]n (3), [Zn1.5(\u03bc6-dpna)(2,2-bipy)]n (4), [Co3(\u03bc3dpna)2(4,4-bipy)2(H2O)8]n\u00b72nH2O (5),[Co(bpb)2(H2O)4]n[Co2(\u03bc3-dpna)2(H2O)4]n\u00b73nH2O (6), and [Mn1.5(\u03bc6-dpna)(\u03bc-dpea)]n (7), wherein 1,2-di(4-pyridyl)ethylene (dpey), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), 2,2\u2032-bipyridine(2,2\u2032-bipy),4,4\u2032-bipyridine(4,4\u2032-bipy),1,4-bis(pyrid-4-yl)benzene (bpb), and 1,2-di(4pyridyl)ethane (dpea) were employed as auxiliary ligands. The structural variation of polymers 1\u20137 spans the range from a 2D sheet (1\u20134, 6, and 7) to a 3D metal\u2013organic framework (MOF, 5). Polymers 1\u20137 were investigated as heterogeneous catalysts in the Knoevenagel condensation reaction, leading to high condensation product yields (up to 100%) under optimized conditions. Various reaction conditions, substrate scope, and catalyst recycling were also researched. This work broadens the application of H3dpna as a versatile tricarboxylate block for the fabrication of functional coordination polymers.",

            "text": "Nowadays, a growing number of transition metal coordination polymers (CPs) serve as crystalline materials because their various topologies and structures [1\u20133]. These functional compounds have prospective applications in gas separation and adsorption [4\u20136], the development of sensors [7,8] and heterogeneous catalysts [9\u201311], and many other fields [12\u201314]. Solvothermal and hydrothermal synthetic methods are widely used in the assembly of coordination polymers [15\u201318]. In the process of self-assembly, many reaction parameters (pH, temperature, concentration, solvent, etc.) as well as the intrinsic characteristics of the organic ligands and metal centers [19\u201326] affect the structures of the coordination polymers. As the main kind of organic ligands for synthesizing coordination polymers, aromatic multi-carboxylic acids are especially attractive given their adjustable deprotonation and charges, tunable coordination modes, and good thermal stability [27\u201330]. Since 2019, our group has been working on the synthesis of coordination polymers with various carboxylic acids and exploring their catalytic performance in organic reactions [31\u201333]. Recently, our group used a pyridine-dicarboxylic acid, 4,4\u2032-(pyridine-3,5-diyl)dibenzoic acid (H2pdba), to synthesize a series of transition metal coordination polymers.

The catalytic properties of the obtained coordination polymers have also been evaluated in Knoevenagel reactions between benzaldehyde and malononitrile.\n2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Hydrothermal Synthesis of Polymers1\u20137\nTo evaluate 5-(3\u2032,5\u2032-dicarboxylphenyl)nicotinic acid (H3dpna) as a promising block for the fabrication of coordination polymers, some reactions were performed under hydrothermal conditions, using a mixture containing a metal(II) chloride, H3dpna (main ligand), sodium hydroxide, and an auxiliary ligand selected from dpey, phen, 2,2\u2032-bipy, 4,4\u2032-bipy, bpb, and dpea. These hydrothermal synthetic reactions were carried out at 160 \u00b0C for three days, and then continued through a slow cooling of the mixtures and the crystallization of coordination polymers, as described in Table 1. The polymers were collected in 42\u201353% yields and characterized using standard methods. The obtained PXRD patterns of 1\u20137 are consistent with the simulated ones (Figure S3), confirming the formation of the homogeneous phase of the obtained polymers. The structural differences in 1\u20137 might be attributed to the type of auxiliary ligand selected as well as the coordination fashion of the metal(II) centers. In polymers 1\u20137, the blocks generated upon the deprotonation of H3dpna showed four different coordination fashions and are partially or totally deprotonated (Hdpna2\u2212and dpna3\u2212, Scheme 2).\nScheme 1. Structures of 3dpna and auxiliary ligands.\nAs a linker, H3dpna ha a lot of interesting char cteri tics that favor its exploration. (a) There is some rotation b ween the phenyl nd pyridine rings, leading to improved adaptability t coo dination preferences of metal(II centers. (b) H3dp a bears s me sites for coordination (six carboxyl O sites a d one pyridine N site). (c) T presence of a free Npyridine atom can provide a base site for catalysis, including Knoevenagel condensation [33 34].

The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F2 with SHELXS-97 and SHELXL-97 [44]. The C, O, and N atoms were refined anisotropically using full-matrix least-squares methods on F2. The H atoms were placed in calculated positions through riding models. In 2, the phen ligands (N4, C43\u2013C54, N5) were split over two sites and refined with 0.70 and 0.30 occupancies. The crystal parameters and structural refinements are summarized in Table 1. The selected bond parameters are collected in Tables S1 and S2 (Supplementary Materials). CCDC 2299559\u20132299565 contains the supplementary crystallographic data of 1\u20137. Topological analysis of the obtained coordination polymers was performed with ToposPro software (Version 5.5.2.1) by producing abbreviated (underlying) nets, therein bridging ligands were simplified to the centroids [45,46]."

Then, the catalyst was removed by centrifugation. The filtrate was evaporated using a rotary evaporator to obtain a crude solid product. This was dissolved in CDCl3 and analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy (JNM ECS 400 M spectrometer) for the quantification of the product (Figure S7). In order to run recycling tests, the catalyst was recollected by centrifugation, washed with methanol, dried at room temperature, and reused in subsequent steps as depicted above."
