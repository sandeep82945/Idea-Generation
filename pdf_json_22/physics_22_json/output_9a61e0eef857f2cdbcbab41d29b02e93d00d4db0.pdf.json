    "abstractText": "In this work, we present metalenses (MLs) designed to enhance the luminous intensity of incoherent light-emitting diodes (LEDs) within the detection angles of 0\u25e6 and 10\u25e6. The detection angle of 0\u25e6 refers to the center of the LED. Because the light emitted from LEDs is incoherent and expressed as a surface light source, they are numerically described as a set of point sources and calculated using incoherent summation. The titanium dioxide (TiO2) and amorphous silicon (a-Si) nanohole meta-atoms are designed; however, the full 2\u03c0 phase coverage is not reached. Nevertheless, because the phase modulation at the edge of the ML is important, an ML is successfully designed. The typical phase profile of the ML enhances the luminous intensity at the center, and the phase profile is modified to increase the luminous intensity in the target detection angle region. Far field simulations are conducted to calculate the luminous intensity after 25 m of propagation. We demonstrate an enhancement of the luminous intensity at the center by 8551% and 2115% using TiO2 and a-Si MLs, respectively. Meanwhile, the TiO2 and a-Si MLs with the modified phase profiles enhance the luminous intensity within the detection angle of 10\u25e6 by 263% and 30%, respectively.",

            "text": "Optical metasurfaces are made up of precisely designed structures, known as meta-atoms, that can modulate the phase [1,2], amplitude [3\u20135], and polarization [6,7] of incident light. Metalenses (MLs) [8\u201314], meta-holograms [13\u201327], structural color [28\u201331], light detection [32\u201338], perfect absorber [39,40], and sensors [41\u201347] are typical applications of optical metasurfaces. Recently, various improvements to MLs have been reported, such as achromatic MLs [48\u201350], polarization-insensitive MLs [50,51], wide field-of-view MLs [52,53], large area MLs [54,55], uses in augmented reality [55,56], tunable focal lengths [38,57\u201359], and fabrication using nanoimprint technology [60,61]. Because MLs are thin and light, they are a potential candidate to completely replace conventional optical lenses, and also have the ability to be combined with conventional bulk optical systems [62]. However, most reported MLs are designed for coherent light sources. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are commonly used as practical light sources [63]. However, the luminous intensity from LEDs dramatically decreases as the light propagates due to the emission of diverging spherical waves [64]. The intensity of light extraction efficiency of LEDs has been enhanced using microlens arrays [65\u201367], surface roughening [68\u201371],\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 153. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12010153 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 153 2 of 14\nphotonic crystal patterning [72,73], patterned substrates [74,75], and surface plasmons [76\u201378]. However, metasurfaces including MLs are difficult to use for LED sources, as the emitted light is incoherent [79,80]. In this study, we numerically design an ML for LED sources. Because the light from the LED is incoherent and is expressed as a surface light source, the LED is described as a set of point sources and the numerical results are calculated using incoherent summation. The ML enhances the luminous intensity within the detection angles of 0\u25e6 (center of the LED) and 10\u25e6 by collimating the diverging light emitted from the LED. We target the detection angle of 10\u25e6 by considering the trade-off between the wide field-of-view and long propagation distance [81]. The phase profile of the ML is modified to spread out the transmitted light to the target detection angle."

            "text": "The LEDs are described as numerous point sources with Lambertian intensity profiles that are incoherently summed. Thus, the designed LED source is an incoherent, unpolarized, surface light source. A 35 \u00b5m square LED source is used in this study. A micro-LED chip can be considered as a point source [82]. Figure 1 shows the simulated results after 20 \u00b5m of propagation with different numbers of points sources. The intensity profiles converge as the number of points sources become 3 \u00d7 3. In addition, the optimized and required chip size is at least 7 \u00b5m for typical display panels, including smartphones, laptops, and televisions [83\u201385], so 5 \u00d7 5 and 7 \u00d7 7 micro-chips are not considered in this study. We consider the LED source composed of 3 \u00d7 3 micro-LED chips, and the light source is described by 3 \u00d7 3 points sources. Because the light emitted from the LED is partially spatial-coherent, the phase of light originating from each point source is random and therefore interference effects are ignored. The propagation results shown in Figure 1 are obtained by adding only the amplitudes of the propagated light.\nThe Lambertian intensity profile is expressed as [86]\nI(\u03b8) = I0 cos \u03b8 (1)\nwhere I is the intensity, \u03b8 is the propagation angle with respect to the optical axis, and I0 is the maximum intensity at \u03b8 = 0, respectively. To describe the Lambertian point source, an interface between two different media is used (Figure S1). Because the transmittance at the interface is dependent on \u03b8, the intensity of the transmitted light also varies with \u03b8. When the distance between the point source and the interface is 40 nm and the refractive indices of the media are 1 and 2, the intensity profile of the transmitted light is similar to a Lambertian intensity profile, therefore allowing us to describe the single point source. The LED source is then modeled as 3 \u00d7 3 point sources placed 40 nm away from the interface. The schematics of the simulation is shown in Figure S2. Figure S3 shows the difference when a single point source and 3 \u00d7 3 points sources are used. However, individual simulations are done for each point source as the LED source is partially spatial-coherent, and therefore interference must be neglected [87]. The final calculations result from the incoherent summation of each individual simulation. The total number of simulations can be reduced if the system is symmetrically designed, allowing some results to be obtained by rotating other results. In addition, the partial temporal coherence of the LED source provides a broad spectral bandwidth of emitted light [88]. The simulation results with both narrowband and broadband sources provide similar results (Figure S4); therefore, the effect of the partial temporal coherence is negligible and ignored.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 153 3 of 14Nanomaterials 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 14\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 153 4 of 14\nIn this work, the points sources are placed at the center of the 3 \u00d7 3 lattice (Figure S2b). The effect of the relative locations of the sources is negligible in a 3 \u00b5m \u00d7 3 \u00b5m LED source, as the 3 \u00d7 3 array of dipole sources provides a similar light emission to a single point source of the same size [89]."

Spherical waves from the LED source are transmitted through the ML and collimated. However, the collimated light is concentrated at the propagation angle of 0\u25e6, so the phase profile is modified to enhance the luminous intensity within the detection angle of 10\u25e6. The modified phase profile \u03d5m is expressed as\n\u03d5m(r, \u03bb) = \u2212 2\u03c0 \u03bb\n(\u221ar2 + f 2 \u2212 f)\u2212 \u221ar2 +( L\n2m tan \u03b1\n)2 \u2212 L\n2m tan \u03b1  (3) where L is the length of the ML, m is the number of point sources that make up of the LED source, and \u03b1 is the detection angle. L is 35 \u00b5m, the same with the length of the LED source, m is 3 because 3 \u00d7 3 points sources are used, and \u03b1 is 10\u25e6 in this study. Because the lengths of the ML and the LED are identical, an ML array can be used to cover a large-area LED composed of equally sized LED pixels. The phase profile from Equation (3) is obtained by adding the phase profiles of the typical ML (Equation (2)) and a concave lens (Figure S5). The second term of Equation (3) originates from the concave lens allowing the transmitted light to spread out to the target detection angle region. Because the LED source is a surface light source and is described as a set of the points sources, the designed ML is split into the subsections one-to-one correspondence with the point sources and the phase profile in each subsection is defined by Equation (2) or (3). The phase profiles at f = 10 \u00b5m and \u03bb = 560 nm are shown in Figure 2. The phase gradient of \u03d5m becomes smaller at the edge of the ML than that of \u03d5t. Thus, when \u03d5m is used, the diverging light from the source is steered less and spreads out to the target detection angle region. Nanomaterials 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 14\nFigure 2.

Nanohole Meta-Atom Since LEDs emit unpolarized light, polarization-insensitive meta-atoms are designed. In addition, nanohole meta-atoms are used instead of nanofins due to good adhesion between the nanohole structure and the substrate when the high aspect ratio (above 1:5) nanostructures are fabricated (Figure S6). Because the dense material is continuously connected, the nanohole structure provides a high production yield. However, the nanofin structure can be relatively easily destroyed during the etching or cleaning process. When the optical axis of the system is parallel to the z-direction, the transmitted electric field through the nanohole is expressed as [50,90\u201392]\n( )1 1exp 2 2 2 x l s l s y E t t t t i E i i \u03b2      + \u2212 = + \u00b1     \u00b1       \n(4)\nwhere tl and ts are complex transmission coefficients when the incident light is polarized along the long and short axis of the nanohole, respectively, and \u03b2 is the rotation angle of the nanohole with respect to the x-axis. The first and the second terms of Equation (4) are known as the co- and cross-polarization terms, respectively, because the Jones vector of each term shows that the polarization of the transmitted light is identical to the incident light at the first term and is opposite the incident light at the second term. The polarization dependence is caused by exp(\u00b1i2\u03b2) from the cross-polarization term. Therefore, the metaatoms are designed to have the same tl and ts to remove the cross-polarization term, which can be achieved using symmetrical meta-atoms such as circle and square holes (Figure S7). Titanium dioxide (TiO2) and amorphous silicon (a-Si) nanohole meta-atoms are usually used at visible frequencies due to their high refractive indices and low loss [93]. Gallium nitride (GaN) has also been used at visible frequencies; however, a sapphire substrate is required and the sapphire substrate is less transparent than fused silica [49]. Thus, TiO2 and a-Si are used in this study. The transmission properties of TiO2 nanohole meta-atoms with a height of 400 nm are investigated using rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) simulations (Figure 3) [94]. The designed meta-atoms work under the spherical wave incidence even though they are designed by RCWA under the plane wave incidence (Figure S8). The phase shown in Figure 3 does not satisfy the complete 2\u03c0 coverage.

The efficiency is defined as the output luminous intensity within \u03b1 (Figure S9) divided by the luminous intensity of the LED source. The TiO2 ML with \u03d5m has higher efficiencies within \u03b1 = 10\u25e6, 20\u25e6, and 30\u25e6 than those of the bare LED, but the ML with \u03d5t has lower efficiency within \u03b1 = 30\u25e6. The luminous intensity within \u03b1 = 10\u25e6 is enhanced by 234% and 263% compared with the LED source when the TiO2 MLs with \u03d5t and \u03d5m are used, respectively (Table S1). Because the ML with \u03d5m has the wide intensity peak profile, the ML has a higher luminous intensity within \u03b1 = 10\u25e6 than that of the ML with \u03d5t despite the lower maximum luminous intensity at the center. Meanwhile, the enhancement of the luminous intensity within \u03b1 = 20\u25e6 and 30\u25e6 is not significant, because the enhancement within \u03b1 = 10\u25e6 is a consequence of steering the transmitted light from the other area to the target detection angle region.

However, the a-Si MLs enhance the efficiencies slightly within \u03b1 = 10\u25e6 and have lower efficiencies within \u03b1 = 20\u25e6 and 30\u25e6 due to the low transmittance of a-Si meta-atoms.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 14\nLED source. The TiO2 ML with \u03c6m has higher efficiencies within \u03b1 = 10\u00b0, 20\u00b0, and 30\u00b0 than those of the bare LED, but the ML with \u03c6t has lower efficiency within \u03b1 = 30\u00b0.

Efficiencies of the LED source and MLs within the different detection angles \u03b1.\n3. Conclusions The MLs are designed to enhance the luminous intensity of incoherent LED sources after 25 m of propagation within \u03b1 = 0\u00b0 and 10\u00b0. The LED source is composed of 3 \u00d7 3 micro-chips and is designed as the set of 3 \u00d7 3 Lambertian point sources. The propagation results are obtained by incoherently adding the simulation result with each single point source. Polarization-insensitive nanohole meta-atoms are designed. Although the phase profiles of the designed MLs do not match with the required phases at the center, the emitted light from the LED source at the center already propagates in the target detection angle region, so the phase modulation at the edge of the MLs is important in this study. When the TiO2 and a-Si MLs with \u03c6t are used, the luminous intensity at the center is enhanced by 8551% and 2115%, respectively. Meanwhile, the TiO2 and a-Si MLs with \u03c6m enhance the luminous intensity within \u03b1 = 10\u00b0 by 263% and 30%, respectively. Because the TiO2 meta-atoms have higher transmittance than that of a-Si, the TiO2 ML shows the higher enhancement. Meanwhile, the efficiency enhancement within \u03b1 = 20\u00b0 or 30\u00b0 is not significant because the ML cannot increase the light extraction efficiency of the LED source and the enhancement within \u03b1 = 0\u00b0 or 10\u00b0 is a consequence of steering the transmitted light. Therefore, the emitted light from the LED source can be delivered over a long distance using the ML, proving that it can be employed for various practical applications using LEDs, including the automotive headlights, display panels and so on."
