    "abstractText": "Fe (II)-and 2-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (Fe (II)/\u03b1-KG DOs) have been applied to catalyze hydroxylation of amino acids. However, the Fe (II)/\u03b1-KG DOs that have been developed and characterized are not sufficient. L-isoleucine dioxygenase (IDO) is an Fe (II)/\u03b1-KG DO that specifically catalyzes the formation of 4-hydroxyisoleucine (4-HIL) from L-isoleucine (L-Ile) and exhibits a substrate specificity toward L-aliphatic amino acids. To expand the substrate spectrum of IDO toward aromatic amino acids, in this study, we analyzed the regularity of the substrate spectrum of IDO using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and found that the distance between Fe2+, C2 of \u03b1-KG and amino acid chain\u2019s C4 may be critical for regulating the substrate specificity of the enzyme. The mutation sites (Y143, S153 and R227) were also subjected to single point saturation mutations based on polarity pockets and residue free energy contributions. It was found that Y143D, Y143I and S153A mutants exhibited catalytic L-phenylalanine activity, while Y143I, S153A, S153Q and S153Y exhibited catalytic L-homophenylalanine activity. Consequently, this study extended the substrate spectrum of IDO with aromatic amino acids and enhanced its application property.",

            "text": "Hydroxyamino acids are unusual amino acids that are commonly found in nature. They exist as secondary metabolites and components of peptides and proteins. Many hydroxyamino acids are components of sugars, peptides and antibiotics and also play an important role in the chemical synthesis of other compounds as precursors and chiral auxiliaries [1\u20136]. Fe (II)- and 2-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (Fe (II)/\u03b1-KG DOs) are a diverse superfamily of proteins that catalyze a variety of oxidative transformations. Industrially, these enzymes are mainly used in the biosynthesis of hydroxylated amino acids and antibiotics [7\u201311]. Currently, there is a common understanding of the Fe (II)/\u03b1-KG DO reaction mechanism for hydroxylation activity. The Fe (II)/\u03b1-KG DO requires Fe (II), usually bound by three residues, to form a highly conserved HXD/E . . . H triad [12]. \u03b1-KG forms complexes with iron in a bidentate manner via its C-1 carboxylate and ketone oxygens [13]. When the substrate binds to the enzyme active site (not, however, to the Fe ion), Fe (II)-bound water is displaced, thus creating a site for binding an O2 molecules, generating an Fe (III)-superoxo intermediate. The distal oxygen atom of the Fe (III)-superoxo intermediate attacks C2 of \u03b1-KG to release CO2 and to yield Fe (IV)=O (ferryl) intermediate. The Fe (IV)=O intermediate attacks the C-H closer to the substrate to form a hydroxylation reaction. Therefore, the distance between the iron ion and the C-H of the substrate is very important [13]. However, the regulation of enzyme selectivity of\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3750. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28093750 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3750 2 of 14\nthe Fe (II)/\u03b1-KG DO-mediated hydroxylation remains unclear. In addition, not enough Fe (II)/\u03b1-KG DOs have been developed and identified, and only a few specific hydroxylases have been reported, such as L-proline 3-hydroxylase from Streptomyces, L-proline 3-hydroxylase from Bacillus thuringiensis, L-proline cis-4-hydroxylase from Mesorhizobium loti, L-proline cis-4-hydroxylase from Sinorhizobium meliloti, L-proline trans-4-hydroxylase from Dactylosporangium, L-proline trans-4-hydroxylase from Amycolatopsis and L-isoleucine dioxygenase (IDO) from Bacillus thuringiensis [14]. In short, these factors prevent the application of these enzymes in the production of various hydroxylated amino acids. IDO is an Fe(II)/\u03b1-KG DO that specifically catalyzes the generation of 4-hydroxyisoleucine (4-HIL) from L-isoleucine (L-Ile) [15,16]. In addition to L-Ile as the target substrate, IDO can also act on other L-aliphatic amino acids and has a substrate spectrum toward such amino acid substrates [17\u201319]. We have previously solved the IDO structure and analyzed the catalytic orientation mechanism of its hydroxylation [20]. To further expand the substrate spectrum of IDO reactions, especially toward aromatic amino acids, we used molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) to simulate the enzyme dynamics of Fe2+ and \u03b1-KG, L-amino acids [L-Ile, D-isoleucine (D-Ile), L-leucine (L-Leu), L-norleucine (L-Nle), L-norvaline (L-Nva), L-phenylalanine (PHE) and L-homophenylalanine (HPHE)]. Then, single point saturation mutagenesis at selected mutation sites was carried out based on polarity pockets and residue free energy contribution, thereby expanding the IDO substrate spectrum for aromatic amino acids to enhance their application properties."

            "text": "Our previous structural analysis showed that the IDO monomer (PDB: 6lnh, Chain A) has 240 amino acids (with the N-terminal purification tag removed) and contains a conserved motif H159-X1-D161-X50-H212 that chelates Fe2+, the active site of IDO [20]. Molecular dynamics simulations using Fe2+, \u03b1-KG and L-Ile as substrates showed that in the IDO active pockets, S153 and P155 formed hydrogen bonds with the amino group of L-Ile, and residues Y143 and R227 had hydrogen bonds to the carboxyl group of L-Ile (Figure 1). Residues S153, P155, Y143 and R227 formed a polar substrate binding pocket, and the formation of this pocket restricted the other end of L-Ile toward Fe2+ and \u03b1-KG, when the carbonyl group of \u03b1-KG (opposite D161 bound to Fe2+) and the C1 position carboxyl group (opposite H159, H212 bound to Fe2+) are bound to Fe2+ in a dentate bound (Figure 1). This makes the C4 of L-Ile in proximity to the Fe2+ (5.9 \u00c5) and C2 of \u03b1-KG (4.7 \u00c5). Such a distance may facilitate the attack of oxygen molecules (the diameter of oxygen molecule is about 3.5 \u00c5) on C4 of L-Ile, where hydroxylation occurs [21,22]. Thus, the distance between Fe2+, C2 of \u03b1-KG and the fourth carbon of L-Ile (where hydroxylation occurs) may be crucial for the incorporation of oxygen molecules and oxidation reactions and important for substrate recognition and catalytic orientation. IDO has a certain substrate spectrum for L-amino acids [17\u201319]. To explore this regularity, we chose L-aliphatic amino acids that can be catalyzed by IDO (although with lower catalytic efficiency), including L-Leu, L-Nva and L-Nle, and analyzed the reaction mechanism by MD simulations [17]. MD simulations showed that the closest distance to Fe2+ was located at C4 of the carbon chain (Fe2+ distances to L-Leu, L-Nva and L-Nle: 5.4, 5.1 and 5.2 \u00c5, respectively) (Figure 2a\u2013c). It is also interesting to note that the distance between C2 of \u03b1-KG and the C4 position of these L-aliphatic amino acids remains essentially around 4.4 \u00c5 (Figure 2), while it is as long as 6.2 \u00c5 in the D-Ile (L-Ile tautomer with a similar structure) which does not react with IDO (Figure 2d). Furthermore, MD simulations showed that the distance between Fe2+, C2 of \u03b1-KG and C4 position of D-Ile fluctuated greatly and was very unstable, whereas the other amino acids quickly reached a stable state (Figure 2e,f). This distance between Fe2+, C2 of \u03b1-KG and C4 of the L-aliphatic amino acid may be more favorable to IDO hydroxylated amino acid at the C4 position. Previous studies on Fe (II)/\u03b1-KG DOs suggest that \u03b1-KG binds reactive ferrous ions and displaces two water\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3750 3 of 14\nmolecules to form an octahedral ligand complex [23\u201325]. During the reaction, one of the water molecules involved in the octahedral ligand complex formation is replaced by a molecule of oxygen, which, through oxidative decarboxylation, produces 1,4-butanedioic acid, CO2 and iron oxide [Fe(IV)=O], followed by high-valent iron interactions with the substrate to undergo hydroxylation [26\u201329]. In contrast, the distance between \u03b1-KG and the C4 position of the L-aliphatic amino acid may make the geometrical configuration of Fe-O more favorable to attack the C4 position of the amino acid for hydroxylation reactions through spatial crowding. This may be one reason why IDO has a favorable substrate spectrum for L-aliphatic amino acids. Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 15\nFigure 1.

In the future, the Y143 and S153 sites can be mutated simultaneously with IDO sites around the benzene ring to further improve their catalytic activity for aromatic side-chain amino acids, thus expanding the reaction of IDO with aromatic amino acids to enhance its application performance.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28093750/s1, Figure S1: LC-MS analysis of products catalyzed by Y143D with substrate PHE; Figure S2: LC-MS analysis of products catalyzed by Y143I with substrate PHE; Figure S3: LC-MS analysis of products catalyzed by S153A with substrate PHE.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.N.; methodology, J.A.; software, J.A.; formal analysis, J.A. and J.G.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, J.A.; writing\u2014review and editing, J.A. and Y.N.; funding acquisition, Y.N.
