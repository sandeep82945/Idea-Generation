The enormous growth of this 31 research area over the past decade with its capability for clinical translation makes a non-32 invasive, automated analysis pipeline of organoids highly desirable. 33\nPurpose: 34\nThis work presents the first application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the non-35 invasive quantification and quality assessment of cerebral organoids using an automated 36 analysis tool. Three specific objectives are addressed, namely organoid segmentation to 37 investigate organoid development over time, global cysticity classification, and local cyst 38 segmentation. 39\n40\nMethods: 41\nNine wildtype cerebral organoids were imaged over nine weeks using high-field 9.4T MRI 42 including a 3D T2*-w and 2D diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequence. This dataset was used 43 to train a deep learning-based 3D U-Net for organoid and local cyst segmentation. For global 44 cysticity classification, we developed a new metric, compactness, to separate low- and high-45 quality organoids. 46\nResults: 47\nThe 3D U-Net achieved a Dice score of 0.92\u00b10.06 (mean \u00b1 SD) for organoid segmentation in 48 the T2*-w sequence. For global cysticity classification, compactness separated low- and high-49 quality organoids with high accuracy (ROC AUC 0.98). DTI showed that low-quality organoids 50 have a significantly higher diffusion than high-quality organoids (p < .001). For local cyst 51 segmentation in T2*-w, the 3D U-Net achieved a Dice score of 0.63\u00b10.15 (mean \u00b1 SD). 52\nConclusion: 53\nWe present a novel non-invasive approach to monitor and analyze cerebral organoids over 54 time using high-field MRI and state-of-the-art tools for automated image analysis, offering a 55 comparative pipeline for personalized medicine. We show that organoid growth can be 56 monitored reliably over time and low- and high-quality organoids can be separated with high 57 accuracy. Local cyst segmentation is feasible but could be further improved in the future. 58\n59"

They are patient-62 derived miniature 3D tissue cultures that are grown from induced pluripotent stem cells. 63 Cerebral organoids have been used to study a wide range of neurological disorders like 64 microcephaly [1] or neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s [2] or Parkinson\u2019s disease [3]. 65\nThe growing interest in organoid research over the past decade [4] results in an increasing 66 amount of data and thus calls for automated analysis and quantification. However, current 67 automated organoid analysis pipelines are limited to smaller, e.g. intestinal, organoids [5] or 68 require organoid sacrifice [6]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows for the generation of 69 3D cerebral organoid time series due to its non-invasive imaging procedure. Furthermore, 70 brain MRI is the gold standard for diagnosis, staging, and treatment guidance of various 71 neurological disorders, thus highlighting its potential for imaging cerebral organoids, which has 72 not yet been exploited. 73\nIn the complex process of organoid cultivation, an important undesired route of organoid 74 differentiation is marked by the occurrence of fluid-filled cavities (or \u2018cysts\u2019) [7, 8]. Thus, 75 accurately and automatically estimating organoid cysticity would greatly contribute to organoid 76 quality monitoring. So far, however, only an approach for automated segmentation of exophytic 77 cysts in patients with polycystic kidney disease using MRI has been reported [9]. 78\nHere, we present the first application of MRI to human brain organoids using a neural network-79 based approach to extract cerebral organoid volume and structural features. Specifically, we 80 address three crucial tasks for organoid monitoring and quality assessment: organoid 81 segmentation, global cysticity classification, and local cyst segmentation. 82\n83"

            "text": "Organoid segmentation is essential to automatically extract features like organoid volume or 86 structure. As shown in Figure 1a-b, the 3D U-Net reached an overall Dice score of 87 0.92\u00b10.06 (mean \u00b1 SD) for organoid segmentation. Even though the model performs very 88 accurately overall, we investigated challenging samples to identify the model\u2019s weaknesses. 89 The model performs poorest for Organoid 3 on day 36 (Dice score of 0.59). For this organoid, 90 the disruption of one or more cystic structures resulted in a reduced overall 91 volume (Supplementary Figure 1) and a split of the organoid into multiple pieces (Figure 1c). 92\nThese pieces stick to the Eppendorf tube wall which causes that part of the organoid border 93 blurs with the MRI background. This biological outlier is unique in our dataset and was 94 therefore difficult to be learned by the model. The analysis of other samples shows that the 95 model captured the organoids very well (Figure 1d-e). 96\n104\nGlobal cysticity classification 105\nCyst formation is an undesired process during cerebral organoid cultivation [7]. Thus, 106 accurately determining organoid cysticity can serve as a quality control tool. Separating low- 107 and high-quality organoids using only their mean intensities resulted in a ROC AUC of only 108 0.65. However, our metric compactness achieved a ROC AUC of 0.98 (Figure 2). 109\nUsing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we observed that low-quality organoids have a 115 significantly higher average diffusion than high-quality organoids (Figure 3a). As can be seen 116 in Figure 3b-c, cysts have an increased diffusion compared to compact tissue. Analysis of other 117 parameter maps are included in Supplementary Table 1. 118\nLocal cyst segmentation 126\nThe good performance for global cysticity classification raises the question of whether cysts 127 can be segmented locally \u2013 which would provide further insight into cyst distribution and 128 location. For this task, the 3D U-Net achieved an overall Dice score of 0.63\u00b10.15 (mean \u00b1 SD). 129 As shown in Figure 4a-b, the Dice scores for individual samples showed a large variation with 130 values ranging from 0.34 to 0.83. The analysis of weak and intermediate model predictions 131 showed discrepancies between model predictions and ground truth especially for organoids 132 with many small cysts (Figure 4c-d). The model performed especially well on images with large, 133 clearly visible, and distinct cysts (Figure 4e). 134\n143\n3. Discussion 144\nIn this study, we introduce high-field MRI for the non-invasive monitoring and analysis of 145 cerebral organoids using a neural network-based approach. Since neither thresholding nor 146 using a 2D U-Net resulted in convincing results for organoid segmentation (Supplementary 147\nTable 2), we used a 3D U-Net which achieved a mean Dice score of 0.92 for organoid 148 segmentation. Comparable methods for MRI brain segmentation achieve Dice scores in the 149 range of 0.72 and 0.93 [17-22]. Such a highly reliable automated analysis will represent a 150 powerful tool to compare wild-type organoids with disease models associated with altered 151 growth rate such as Zika-Virus disease [23] or microcephaly [24]. 152\nAs the first step, reliable organoid segmentation paves the way for comprehensive quality 153 monitoring including morphological and functional tissue parameters. The newly introduced 154 metric compactness, inspired by the concept of signal-to-signal ratio [25, 26], assesses overall 155 cysticity. It successfully separated high- and low-quality organoids at an outstanding ROC AUC 156\nof 0.98, closely matching the phenotypical appearance of previously reported high- and low-157 quality organoids [7, 8]. On a functional level, as expected, it was shown that low-quality 158 organoids have a significantly higher diffusion than high-quality organoids most likely reflecting 159 higher fluid content. 160\nSuccessful global cysticity assessment led to the question of whether cysts can be segmented 161 locally to differentiate solid compartments from fluid-filled cavities. The 3D U-Net trained for 162 local cyst segmentation reached a mean Dice score of 0.63 which indicates a challenging 163 segmentation task. Other challenging segmentation tasks such as ischemic stroke lesion 164 segmentation achieve even lower Dice scores of 0.37 in MRI [27, 28] and 0.54 in CT [27, 29]. 165 Especially for organoids having many small cysts, correct local cyst segmentation appears to 166 be a major challenge due to technical resolution and contrast-to-noise ratio limits. In such 167 cases, global cysticity classification may thus capture more easily the fluent transition from 168 compact to cystic organoids. 169\nSome limitations need to be taken into consideration. On the one hand, reliable organoid 170 segmentation and global cysticity assessment could be achieved despite the relatively small 171 dataset and heterogeneous organoid morphology. Thus, we do not expect a boost in 172 performance here when extending the dataset. On the other hand, local cyst segmentation 173 could probably benefit from a larger dataset. However, technical limitations of the image 174 acquisition would most likely still impede segmentation performance in case of many small 175 cysts due to uncertainty with respect to exact boundary detection for both human annotation 176 and model prediction. 177\nOverall, this work presents the first application of MRI for the non-invasive analysis of cerebral 178 organoids. It was shown that cerebral organoids can be accurately monitored over time and 179 for quality assessment using state-of-the-art tools for automated image analysis. These results 180 highlight the potential of our pipeline for clinical application to larger-scale comparative 181 organoid analysis. 182\n183\n4. Materials and Methods 184\nThe code to reproduce the results is publicly available on GitHub 185 (https://github.com/deiluca/cerebral_organoid_quant_mri). All MRI images and annotations for 186 organoid segmentation, global cysticity classification, and local cyst segmentation generated 187 for this work are publicly available on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/7805426, DOI: 188 10.5281/zenodo.7805426). 189\nDifferentiation of cerebral organoids 190\nOrganoids were generated according to [10] with minor modifications. Wildtype iPSCs were 191 singled and seeded at a density of 8x104 cells/ml in a V-shaped 96 well plate in organoid 192 formation medium (DMEM/F12, KnockOut Serum Replacement, NEAA, \u00df-mercaptoethanol) 193 supplemented with 4ng/ml bFGF and Y-27632 (50\u00b5M) to induce embryoid body (EB) 194 formation. The following day, the medium was exchanged to remove Y-27632 and lower the 195 bFGF concentration to 2ng/ml. On day 5, neural induction was initiated by exchanging the 196 medium to neural induction medium (DMEM/F12, N2 supplement, NEAA, glutamine, 1 \u00b5g/ml 197 heparin) with a medium change on day 7. On day 9, EBs were embedded into Matrigel droplets 198 and cultivated until day 13 in organoid differentiation medium (ODM) 1 199 (DMEM/F12:Neurobasal medium 50:50, NEAA, glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, N2 200\nsupplement, B27 supplement w/o vitamin A, insulin, \u00df-mercaptoethanol). On day 13, organoids 201 were excised from the droplets and transferred into a 12-well plate containing organoid 202 differentiation medium 2 (DMEM/F12:Neurobasal medium 50:50, NEAA, glutamine, 203 penicillin/streptomycin, N2 supplement, B27 supplement with vitamin A, insulin, \u00df-204 mercaptoethanol) and placed on a shaker in the incubator with medium exchange every 2-3 205 days. After imaging, the organoids were transferred back to the plate containing fresh medium 206 and placed on the incubation shaker for further development. 207\nMRI 208\nFor MR measurements, organoids were transferred to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes containing 209 standard ODM (T2-time of ~64 ms in this experimental setting) and conveyed to the MRI using 210 warming packs for temperature control. In total, nine organoids were scanned at varying time 211 points over a period of 64 days, resulting in 45 individual samples. Three Eppendorf tubes 212 were placed next to each other in a holder, thus allowing simultaneous imaging of three 213 organoids (Supplementary Figure 2). Nine control organoids not undergoing MRI served as 214 handling control. Before and after imaging, the medium was analyzed in both groups using a 215 blood gas analyzer which showed that MRI had no specific negative effect on organoid 216 health (Supplementary Table 3). 217\nMRI was performed at room temperature using a high-field 9.4 Tesla horizontal bore small 218 animal experimental NMR scanner (BioSpec 94/20 USR, Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Ettlingen, 219 Germany) equipped with a four-channel phased-array surface receiver coil. The MR protocol 220 included the following sequences: 221\n1. High-resolution T2*-weighted gradient echo sequence: 3D sequence, echo time (TE): 222 18 ms, repetition time (TR): 50 ms, 80 \u00b5m isotropic resolution, acquisition matrix: 400 223 x 188 x 100, flip angle: 12\u02da, number of averages: 1, duration: 15 min 40 s. This 224 sequence was chosen to allow for accurate isotropic imaging and to account for 225 potential susceptibility effects caused by e.g. neuromelanin [11], cellular debris or 226 calcifications. 227 2. DTI-spin echo sequence: 2D sequence, TE: 18.1 ms, TR: 1200 ms, 100 \u00b5m in-plane 228 resolution, acquisition matrix: 120 x 50, slice thickness: 1.5 mm, number of diffusion 229 gradient directions: 18 + 5 A0 images, b-values: 0/650 s/mm\u00b2, gradient duration: 2.5 230 ms, gradient separation: 15.5 ms, flip angle: 130\u00b0, number of averages: 1, duration: 23 231 min 05 s. This sequence was included to account for organoid inner structure including 232 nerve fiber growth [12]. 233\nOrganoid segmentation 234\nOrganoid segmentation was performed to assign each image voxel to one of two categories: 235 organoid or non-organoid. For this task, we used min-max normalized images from the T2*-w 236 sequence. Since simpler methods like Multi-Otsu\u2019s threshold [13] and a 2D U-Net [14] did not 237 deliver convincing results (Supplementary Table 2), we used a 3D U-Net [15] for 238 efficient (Supplementary Table 4) organoid segmentation. We trained the model with 239 Adam (learning rate 1\u00d710\u22123, weight decay 1\u00d710\u22127) for 2,000 iterations with batch size 1 and a 240 combination of binary cross entropy and Dice loss. 241\nFor model evaluation, we used the Dice score, which is commonly used to quantify the 242 performance of image segmentation methods. It is defined as two times the area of the 243 intersection divided by the total number of voxels in the ground truth and predicted 244 segmentation (Eq. 1). A perfect segmentation corresponds to a Dice score of 1. 245\n\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52 =\n2 \u22c5 |A \u2229 B|\n|A| + |B|\nEq. 1\nTo get an unbiased estimate of the model performance, we used organoid-wise Leave-One-246 Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV). For each of the nine LOOCV splits, we used a random 80% 247 training, 20% validation split for model selection. The Dice score in the Results section refers 248 to the model performance on the LOOCV test set. 249\nGlobal cysticity classification 250\nGlobal cysticity classification aims at determining the overall organoid cysticity: cystic (low-251 quality) or non-cystic (high-quality). To provide a reference ground truth based on the T2*-w 252 sequence, an organoid was categorized as low-quality if a cystic structure was detected within 253 the organoid, consistent with findings on brightfield imaging (Supplementary Figure 3) as 254 previously reported [7, 8]. Otherwise, it was categorized as high-quality. 255\nFor automatic classification, we constructed the simple metric compactness which serves as 256 an environment-based estimator of organoid cysticity (Eq. 2). It is based on the idea that cysts 257 are filled with similar fluid like the medium under the assumption of relative B1-homogeneity in 258 a stereotyped region close to the surface coil. Therefore, the more similar the organoid 259 intensities are to the medium intensities, the more cystic the organoid is. 260\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 \u2254 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc60[\u03bc(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc54) \u2212 \u03bc(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5a)] \ud835\udf07(\ud835\udc4b) \u2254 1\n|\ud835\udc4b| \u2211 \ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc65\u2208\ud835\udc4b\n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc60(\ud835\udc65) = { \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc65 \u2265 0\n\u2212\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\nA \u2216 B = {x \u2208 A: x \u2209 B}\n\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc54 = {intensities of organoid voxels} \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5a = {intensities of medium voxels}\\\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc54\nEq. 2\nWhile intorg was derived from the ground truth organoid segmentations, intmedium was 261 determined by applying Otsu\u2019s threshold [16] 2D-wise along all organoid-containing coronal 262 planes (Supplementary Figure 4). The first and last organoid-containing coronal planes were 263 discarded to filter artifacts caused by noisy medium intensities. 264\nFor the evaluation of compactness, we used the area under the Receiver Operator 265 Characteristic curve (ROC AUC). ROC AUC is a common metric for the evaluation of binary 266 classification problems; a perfect classifier achieves a ROC AUC of 1. 267\nTo further probe tissue characteristics of low- and high-quality organoids, parameter 268 maps (Trace; FA; 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Eigenvalues) were extracted from the DTI sequence using 269 the built-in analysis tool (Paravision 6.0, Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany). We used 270 a two-sided T-test to test for significantly different average diffusion and used Holm-\u0160\u00edd\u00e1k to 271 adjust for multiple testing. 272\nLocal cyst segmentation 273\nLocal cyst segmentation aims at localizing cysts. For this task, we used the T2*-w sequence 274 and manually annotated cysts. Due to the low-resolution images, especially smaller cysts are 275 difficult to annotate. Therefore, we excluded organoids with less than 1,000 voxels (0.51 mm3) 276 in cysts and included 34 samples in total. For segmentation, we trained and evaluated a 277 3D U-Net [15] as for organoid segmentation but with 5,000 training iterations. 278\nReferences 279\n[1] Lancaster MA, Renner M, Martin C-A, Wenzel D, Bicknell LS, Hurles ME, Homfray T, 280 Penninger JM, Jackson AP, Knoblich JA.

For better visibility in this figure, we cut 379 the coronal plane to the Eppendorf tube boundaries. 380\nSupplementary Tables 381\nSupplementary Table 1 ROC AUCs and adjusted p-values for separation of low- and high-382 quality organoids for selected DTI parameter maps. 383\nDTI parameter map ROC AUC P-value Trace 0.91 1.1 \u00d7 10-5 3rd Eigenvalue 0.86 6.2 \u00d7 10-4 2nd Eigenvalue 0.91 1.2 \u00d7 10-5 1st Eigenvalue 0.93 2.1 \u00d7 10-5 Fractional Anisotropy (FA) 0.63 9.9 \u00d7 10-1\n384\nSupplementary Table 2 Organoid segmentation performance of Multi-Otsu\u2019s threshold [13] 385 and 2D U-Net [14] in the T2*-w sequence. Multi-Otsu\u2019s threshold was applied in 3D for the 386 three classes MRI background, Eppendorf tube, and organoid using the Python package scikit-387 image. For the 2D U-Net, the images were extracted along the coronal axis. For 2D U-Net 388 training and evaluation, the implementation from https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet was 389 utilized. 2D U-Net: binary semantic segmentation; 200 epochs; batch size 1; learning rate 390 0.00001; loss: binary cross entropy + Dice loss (weighted 1:10), weight decay: 0.001; 391 augmentation: random rotation (probability 0.75). 392\nMethod Dice score (mean \u00b1 SD)\nMulti-Otsu\u2019s threshold 0.08\u00b10.09 2D U-Net 0.58\u00b10.43\n393\nSupplementary Table 3 Blood gas analysis shows no specific negative effect of MRI on 394 organoids.
