The association between selenium supplementation and acute toxic reactions and clinical outcomes in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the safety profile of add-on Se yeast and assess the potential of Se to ameliorate the hematologic toxicity of concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with cervical cancer.\nMethods: Patients with Federation International of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIB cervical cancer who met all inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group. The experimental group received Se yeast tablets (100 \u03bcg Se, twice daily), while the control group received placebos (twice daily) for 5 weeks in total. All patients in both groups received standard treatment, including pelvic external irradiation, concurrent five cycles of chemotherapy, and brachytherapy. Measures included the incidence of myelosuppression, impairment of liver and kidney function, objective response rate (ORR), and blood Se concentrations before, during and after the treatment of the two groups.\nResults: A total of 104 eligible patients were enrolled in the experimental group (n = 50) or the control group (n = 54). The ORR in the experimental group and control group were 96 and 94%, respectively (p = 0.47). The baseline levels of blood Se before treatment in the experimental and control groups were similar (58.34 \u00b1 17.63 \u03bcg/L and 60.21 \u00b1 18.42 \u03bcg/L, p = 0.60), but the concentrations became significantly different after course completion between the two groups (76.16 \u00b1 24.47 \u03bcg/L and 57.48 \u00b1 14.92 \u03bcg/L, respectively, p < 0.01). Se dramatically decreased the incidence of grade 3 myelosuppression (48% vs. 63%, p = 0.034) compared to the control group. In the subgroup of patients with moderately well-differentiated cervical cancer, the incidence of thrombocytopenia induced by concurrent chemoradiotherapy was lower in the experimental group than in the control group (53.8% vs. 78.9%, p < 0.01)."

            "text": "Cervical cancer is one of the most common gynecological malignant tumors, with 604,000 new cases and 342,000 deaths worldwide reported in 2020 (1). The standard treatment mode of early-stage (FIGO stage IA-IB1) patients is radical hysterectomy, lymph node dissection, and/or radiotherapy, and locally advanced stage (FIGO stage IB2-IVA) patients mainly receive platinum-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (2). The overall incidence of genitourinary complications is reported to be\u00a0between 17 and 40% in patients with concurrent chemoradiotherapy, while acute toxicity of grades 3\u20134 occurs in 17.1% of patients with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (3). Acute toxic reactions caused by concurrent chemoradiotherapy often require dose modifications or radiotherapy treatment suspension, which could potentially impair the curative effects of concurrent chemoradiotherapy and prolong the length of stay in the hospital. Previous studies demonstrated that intensity modulation radiotherapy significantly reduced the level of gastrointestinal and hematological toxicity in patients with cervical cancer in comparison to conventional radiotherapy (4, 5). It is imperative to search for an effective strategy to decrease the incidence of acute side effects during concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with cervical cancer.\nSelenium is an essential trace element and has extremely important biological functions in human health. Previous studies have demonstrated that selenium compounds can enhance the effect of radiotherapy and chemotherapy (6\u20138). Several studies have revealed that selenium supplementation may decrease the toxicity of chemotherapy and radiotherapy (9\u201311). However, these studies have been constrained by the limited number of patients included and the lack of randomized controlled clinical trials, and the association between selenium supplementation and acute toxic reactions and clinical outcomes in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy remains unclear. Therefore, we\u00a0 conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess whether adding selenium yeast to platinum-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy would decrease acute side effects during treatment and improve efficacy compared with placebo for patients with stage IIB cervical cancer."

Epidemiological studies demonstrated that salt fortified with selenium as sodium selenite decreased the incidence of hepatocellular cancer by 35% compared to the control group (13). The Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial was the first double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial to assess whether selenium supplementation could reduce the risk of cancer. Selenium supplementation showed effects of 50% lower total cancer mortality (p = 0.002) and 37% lower total cancer incidence (p = 0.001) (14). Selenium deficiency also increases the risk of cervical cancer (15). On the other hand, selenium can reduce the harmful toxicities of radiotherapy and chemotherapy without compromising efficacy (8). In this study, we\u00a0found that selenium supplementation decreased the incidence of grade 3 myelosuppression (p = 0.034) but had no effect on the incidence of grade 0\u20131 myelosuppression, with 26 (52%) in the experimental group and 25 (46.3%) in the control group (p = 0.695). Selenium supplementation did not decrease the incidence of thrombocytopenia in patients with cervical cancer between the two groups. However, in a subgroup of patients with highly differentiated cervical cancer, a significant difference in platelet toxicity was observed, with 7 of 13 (53.8%) in the experimental group and 15/19 (78.9%) in the control group (p < 0.01).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial exploring the role of the addition of selenium in the treatment of patients with cervical cancer. Although several studies have confirmed that selenium supplementation enhances the efficacy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy (17), another phase II clinical trial revealed the opposite result in patients with stage III and stage IV head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated with selenomethionine combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy and simple concurrent chemoradiotherapy. It was found that there was no significant difference in CR, overall survival, and progression-free survival between the two groups (17). Although the short-term efficacy of selenium yeast combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for cervical cancer has not improved, our data showed that the incidence of myelosuppression in the experimental group was lower than that in the control group. Similar effects have been observed by Katya\u2019s team, who noticed that there was no increase in the toxicity of platelets, white blood cell count, neutrophils, hematocrit, and hemoglobin during the\nselenium supplementation period in leukemia/lymphoma patients (18). Moreover, another study has shown that the addition of 500 \u03bcg/day sodium selenite during radiotherapy can reduce the number and severity of diarrhea caused by radiotherapy (10). Recently, a Japanese study revealed that serum selenium predicts achievement of full-dose cisplatin in concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Selenium deficiency before treatment was independently associated with poor compliance with cisplatin (19). Collectively, these studies support our findings that selenium supplementation ameliorates the toxic effects of chemoradiotherapy without extra gastrointestinal side effects, providing a new strategy to improve the tolerance and compliance of patients to chemoradiotherapy.\nCurrent studies indicate that radiation therapy and cisplatin induce lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in cancer cell lines, human cancer samples, and the renal proximal tubules of mice (20, 21). Polyunsaturated fatty acids participate in the formation of essential lipid products that play a crucial role in activating or inhibiting platelet function (22). The platelet membrane structure is very complex with a large number of lipids, making it very sensitive to radiation-induced lipid peroxidation. Recently, a study indicated that although the exposure dose was below the limit, medical workers exposed to low-dose ionizing radiation for a short period of time might have increased first and then decreased platelets (23). Hemoglobin, heme, and hemin produced by old red blood cells trigger ferroptosis in platelets (24). GPX4 is a selenoprotein that utilizes reduced glutathione to convert lipid hydroperoxides to lipid alcohols, thereby alleviating lipid peroxidation and inhibiting ferroptosis. Selenium supplementation can activate GPX4 activity and alleviate ferroptosis inducer RSL3 and erastin-induced lipid oxidation in the retina and heart samples of mice (unpublished data). Hence, we\u00a0hypothesize that selenium supplementation ameliorates the toxic effects of chemoradiotherapy on platelets by activating GPX4 and mitigates lipid peroxidation, which needs further study in the future.\nAlthough we\u00a0have provided evidence demonstrating that selenium supplementation can reduce side effects but does not compromise the therapeutic effect of chemoradiotherapy, the molecular mechanism remains unknown. Our trial had several limitations, including that the sample size was limited and the dosage and duration of selenium supplementation were not optimized but can be\u00a0improved by longer and larger trials in the future. We\u00a0 will continue to follow up with our participants for a much longer time to observe the effect of selenium supplementation on the survival time and gastrointestinal side effects of our patients with cervical cancer."
