            "text": "GABAA receptors are inhibitory chloride channels located in the mammalian central nervous system. They are targeted by many heavily used pharmaceuticals such as benzodiazepinebased sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics, barbiturate-based anticonvulsants, and general anesthetics of a broad range of chemotypes [1\u20133]. Structurally, these channels are pentamers, i.e. consisting of 5 subunits, which can be drawn from a pool of 19 different subtypes (\u03b1 1\u20136, \u03b2 1\u20133, \u03b3 1\u20133, \u03b4 , \u03b5 ,\n\u03b8, \u03c0, and \u03c1). An example of a typical subunit arrangement is shown in Fig.\u00a01.\nAdditionally, Fig.\u00a0 1 shows the binding site of the endogenuous ligand GABA at the \u03b1-/\u03b2 + binding site, besides alternative binding sites for benzodiazepines (Bz) and pyrazoloquinolinones (PQ). Besides those binding sites, additional possible binding sites have been identified which allow several ligand classes to interact with this family of receptors as well, making them highly promiscuous [1]. As a consequence, side effects are associated with all current therapies that target GABAA receptors; thus, there is still the need to further investigate and develop improved ligands with subtype selectivity [4].\nThe complex structure of this receptor makes it a challenging task to selectively target one of the binding sites or even more to target a specific subunit subtype selectively [2, 5]. To elucidate this problem, PQs have been in the center\n* Michael Schn\u00fcrch michael.schnuerch@tuwien.ac.at\n1 Institute of\u00a0Applied Synthetic Chemistry, TU Wien, Getreidemarkt 9/163, 1060\u00a0Vienna, Austria\n2 Center for\u00a0Brain Research, Medical University of\u00a0Vienna, Spitalgasse 4, 1090\u00a0Vienna, Austria\n1 3\nof our attention for some time [1, 3, 5\u20139], and > 100 compounds were prepared with different substitution patterns on the A and D ring.\nIn the present work, we targeted a more profound alteration of the scaffold, by exchanging the A ring with thiophene derivatives, since thiophene is a well-known bioisoster for the phenyl moiety [10]. The proposed derivatives would still maintain the same putative pharmacophores, as depicted in Fig.\u00a02."

            "text": "Traditionally, the initial step of a PQ synthesis starts from the accordingly substituted aniline 1, which is condensed with diethyl ethoxymethylene malonate (DEEMM, 2) to obtain a phenylaminomethylenemalonate intermediate 3 (Scheme\u00a01) [11].\nHowever, this route is not feasible for electron-rich heterocycles, such as thiophene, since some required amines of these heterocycles are unstable [12]. Therefore, several\n1429Novel pyrazolothienopyridinones as\u00a0potential GABAA receptor modulators\n1 3\nalternatives were explored to overcome this obstacle and obtain the thiophenyl aminomethylenemalonate intermediates (Scheme\u00a02, compounds 6 and 9 and Scheme\u00a03, compounds 15, 16, and 20).\nOne of these compounds, namely 6, was already reported in literature [5]. The synthesis started from\nmethyl 3-aminothiophene-2-carboxylate (4), which was hydrolyzed to the corresponding carboxylic acid 5 and subsequently, in a one-pot fashion, decarboxylated and condensed to the desired intermediate 6 at the same time (Scheme\u00a02). This strategy is an attractive option, provided that such a starting material is obtainable, since three\nScheme 1\nScheme 2\nScheme 3\n1430 B.\u00a0A.\u00a0Vega Alanis et al.\n1 3\ndifferent transformations were done without the purification of each intermediate.\nThe regioisomeric product 9 had to be prepared via an alternative route. Hence, it was tried to start from 2-thiophenecarboxylic acid (7) and synthesize Boc-protected 2-aminothiopene (8) via a Curtius rearrangement as reported in literature [13]. Deprotection and reaction with DEEMM would provide the desired intermediate 9. Indeed, 8 could be obtained in 80% yield, however, deprotection attempts only led to a black precipitate which did not yield intermediate 9 after its treatment with dry pyridine and DEEMM. Consequently, a different method for the synthesis of intermediate 9 had to be chosen [12].\nReduction of 2-nitrothiophene 10 with SnCl2\u20272H2O was carried out and the resulting hexachlorostannate salt 11 was isolated in a crude form. Subsequently, pyridine was added to transform 11 to 2-aminothiophene in\u00a0situ followed by immediate condensation with DEEMM gave 9 in 93% yield.\nFor the remaining target compounds 15, 16, and 20 the strategy based on the Curtius rearrangement could be applied [14\u201317]. Substrates 12a, 12b, and 17 gave the Boc protected amines 13a, 13b, and 18 in 91%, 43%, and 50% yield, respectively. Subsequently, the corresponding hydrochloride salts of the amines 14a, 14b, and 19 were obtained in 64%, 73%, and 98% yield via water-free deprotection with 4\u00a0M HCl in dioxane (Scheme\u00a03). The isolation consisted of a simple filtration step and compounds 14a, 14b, and 19 were subjected immediately to the next step, where pyridine was used both as a solvent and as a base to regenerate the desired aminothiophene in\u00a0situ. Anhydrous conditions were selected for this step since it was observed that the amine hydrochlorides were unstable when exposed to air. The target compounds 15, 16, and 20 were isolated in 32%, 78%, and 88% yield, respectively. Generally, the method is very convenient for handling potentially unstable aminothiophenes. The\nobtained aminothiophene hydrochlorides 14a, 14b, and 19 are easy to handle, and the use of high temperatures for the condensation with DEEMM is unnecessary, in contrast to other reported literature procedures [18]. It is noteworthy to mention that characterization of intermediates 14a, 14b, and 19 was not possible. 1H NMR of these salts did not show the expected ammonium signal and only noise was observed, most likely due to instability of the salts in deuterated solvents where traces of water or HCl (in case of CDCl3) are typically present.\nHaving compounds 6, 9, 15, 16, and 20 in hand, the rest of the synthetic route was performed in a similar way to the classical synthesis of PQ derivatives [7] (Scheme\u00a04). The aforementioned intermediates were thermally cyclized in Ph2O as solvent to give compounds 21, 22, and 25\u201327, which were then were chlorinated with phosphorous oxychloride, obtaining compounds 23, 24, and 28\u201330 (Scheme\u00a04).\nAfterwards, compounds 23, 24, and 28\u201330 underwent a nucleophilic aromatic substitution using 4-methoxyphenylhydrazine hydrochloride as the nucleophile adding NEt3 to generate the free hydrazine in refluxing EtOH overnight. Under these conditions, the hydrazine substituted compounds 31\u201333 were obtained, however in low yields (Scheme\u00a05). For further cyclization to the final products 34\u201336, more forcing conditions had to be applied. These consisted of the stronger base potassium tert-butoxide and an increased temperature of 140\u00a0\u00b0C, which required DMAc as solvent (Scheme\u00a05).\nOn the way to product 38, the intermediate hydrazine 37 was not isolated, but after nucleophilic substitution adding the stronger base potassium tert-butoxide to the NEt3 solution and increasing the temperature to 140\u00a0\u00b0C, which required DMAc as co-solvent, delivered 38 in a one-pot fashion in 19% yield (Scheme\u00a06) as previously reported in literature [5].\nScheme 4\n1431Novel pyrazolothienopyridinones as\u00a0potential GABAA receptor modulators\n1 3\nIn the case of substrate 30, the hydrazine intermediate could not be detected, since even with NEt3 in ethanol, the second cyclization towards the final product occurred immediately delivering 39 in 46% yield (Scheme\u00a06).\nIn conclusion, several strategies towards the synthesis of regioisomeric (in respect to the position of the sulfur) pyrazolothienopyridinones derivatives was achieved, which will further enable the development of new pyrazoloquinolinone derivatives. The major challenge, handling extremely electron rich thiophene amines was solved, which can serve as a blurprint for further derivatives with such features. The obtained target molecules will be subjected to biological testing and these results will be reported in due course."

All melting points were obtained without additional recrystallization directly after flash column chromatography (FCC) with light petroleum (LP) and EtOAc and subsequent drying in high vacuum.\nGeneral procedure 1: synthesis of\u00a0heterocyclic tert\u2011butyl\u2011carbamate derivatives / Boc\u2011protected heterocyclic amine derivatives\nHeterocyclic tert-butyl-carbamate derivatives were synthesized according to a literature procedure [14]. In a previously dried 25 cm3 three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, reflux condenser, septa, and in an argon atmosphere, 1\u00a0eq. of the corresponding heterocyclic carboxylic acid was added, which was subsequently dissolved in dry tert-butanol. Afterward, 1.1\u00a0eq. of triethylamine was added, followed by the addition of 1.01\u00a0eq. of diphenylphosphoryl azide. The mixture was heated to reflux (85\u00a0\u00b0C) and was kept at refluxing temperature overnight. The initially light brown colored mixture became dark during the reaction time. After full conversion was observed on a TLC (DCM/MeOH 95:5 + 3 drops AcOH) using bromocresol green as a staining agent, the reaction mixture was poured into water, extracted 3 times with EtOAc and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the resulting product of this procedure was subjected to flash column chromatography using LP:CHCl3 = 60:40 as mobile phase to obtain the corresponding heterocyclic tert-butyl carbamates 13a, 13b, and 18.\nGeneral procedure 2: synthesis of\u00a0heterocyclic ammonium salts\nHeterocyclic ammonium salts were synthesized according to a literature procedure [20, 21]. In a 10 cm3 dry reaction vial, equipped with a magnetic stirrer, septum, and an argon atmosphere, 1\u00a0eq. of the corresponding heterocyclic tertbutyl carbamate was added to a commercial solution of 4 N HCl in dioxane (13.8\u00a0eq.), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature until full consumption of the starting material was observed via TLC, using ninhydrin as a staining agent. Afterwards, a precipitate was observed in the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was diluted with diethyl ether, and the product was collected by filtration, washed with diethyl ether, and dried in vacuo to afford the corresponding heterocyclic salts 14a, 14b, and 19 as a product.\nGeneral procedure 3: condensation with\u00a0diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate (DEEMM)\nDiethylthiophenylamino methylene malonate derivatives were synthesized according to a literature procedure [14]. In a previously dried 30 cm3 reaction vial, equipped with a magnetic stirrer, septum, and an argon atmosphere, the corresponding heterocyclic salt was mixed with the required amount of diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate, and afterwards, dry pyridine was added to the reaction vial. The reaction was heated at 40\u00a0\u00b0C and stirred overnight. After full conversion was observed via TLC using ninhydrin as a staining agent, water was added to the reaction mixture and extracted with chloroform. The organic phase was dried over magnesium or sodium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo, obtaining a crude material. The derivatives 9, 15, 16, and 20 obtained via this procedure were purified via flash column chromatography using PE/EtOAc as mobile phase.\nGeneral procedure 4: thermal cyclization\nEthylhydroxythienopyridine carboxylate derivatives were synthesized according to a literature procedure [3]. In a round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and reflux condenser, the desired condensed substituted aniline derivate (1\u00a0eq.) was dispersed in approximately 2 cm3 of diphenyl ether and heated to 235\u00a0\u00b0C with a heating mantel. After full consumption was observed via TLC analysis using ninhydrin as a staining agent, the reaction mixture was adsorbed onto celite and purified via flash column chromatography, using mixtures of PE/EtOAc to yield the desired derivatives 21, 22, and 25\u201327.\nGeneral procedure 5: synthesis of\u00a0chlorothienopyridine carboxylate derivatives\nChlorothienopyridine carboxylate derivatives were synthesized according to a literature procedure [3]. The desired hydroxythienopyridine carboxylate was suspended in POCl3 and heated to reflux. After full conversion was observed via TLC analysis, the reaction mixture was cooled in an ice bath. Some pieces of ice were added slowly to the reaction mixture, followed by the careful addition of distilled water, ensuring the reaction temperature did not rise. Afterward, the pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 8 by adding either a saturated solution of Na2CO3 or solid Na2CO3. Then, the reaction mixture was extracted using EtOAc, dried over Mg2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude material obtained from this procedure was purified via flash column chromatography, using mixtures of PE/EtOAc to yield the purified halogenated derivatives 23, 24, and 28\u201330.\n1433Novel pyrazolothienopyridinones as\u00a0potential GABAA receptor modulators\n1 3\nGeneral procedure 6: nucleophilic aromatic substitution of\u00a0chlorothienopyridine carboxylates\nEthyl phenylhydrazineylthienopyridine carboxylate derivatives were synthesized according to a modified literature procedure [3].

Afterward, 1\u00a0eq. of the desired chlorothienopyridine carboxylate was added, and the reaction mixture was heated to reflux and stirred overnight or until full consumption of the starting material was observed via TLC analysis. Afterward, distilled water was added to the reaction mixture, extracted 3 times with ethyl acetate, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude material was purified via flash column chromatography, using mixtures of PE/EtOAc as mobile phase to yield the desired derivatives 31\u201333 and 39.\nGeneral procedure 7: formation of\u00a0pyrazolothienopyridinone derivatives\nPyrazolothienopyridinone derivatives were synthesized according to a literature procedure [22]. In a 50 cm3 flask with a septum, 1\u00a0eq. of the corresponding phenylhydrazineylthienopyridine carboxylate derivative and 1.5\u00a0eq. of t-BuOK were added and 3 times evacuated and flushed with argon. Afterward, 3 cm3 of the solvent were added to the flask. The reaction mixture was heated to 140\u00a0\u00b0C overnight. After full conversion was observed according to TLC analysis, the solvent was concentrated in vacuo. The product was purified via prep RP-HPLC. This procedure yielded derivatives 34\u201336.\nDiethyl 2\u2011[(thiophen\u20112\u2011ylamino)methylene]malonate (9) [12, 17] Compound 9 was synthesized according to general procedure 3, using 11 (1.82\u00a0g, 3.42\u00a0mmol) as starting material, 1\u00a0eq. of DEEMM (1.03 cm3, 3.42\u00a0mmol) and dry pyridine (20 cm3). After full consumption of the starting material was observed, water was added to the reaction mixture and in this particular reaction, a precipitate was formed during this step. The precipitate was filtered from the solvent and thoroughly washed with chloroform several times until obtaining a gray solid. Separately, the mother liquor was extracted with chloroform. Both chloroform phases were collected, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was purified via flash column chromatography, using a gradient of PE/EtOAc 95:5 to PE/EtOAc 90:10.

In a three-necked 50 cm3 round-bottomed flask, 2-nitrothiophene (10, 1.70 g, 13.2 mmol, 1 eq) was suspended in 20 cm3 of concentrated HCl and the mixture was heated to 50 \u00b0C and stirred until the substrate was dissolved. Afterwards, dihydrate stannous chloride (2 eq.) was added portionwise to the mixture, maintaining the reaction temperature between 40\u201345 \u00b0C by immersion in an ice bath.
