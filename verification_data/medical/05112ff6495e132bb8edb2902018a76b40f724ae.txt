"To implement the Health China strategy and improve the health of urban older people, further attention should be paid to the role of neighborhood social capital, creating a harmonious environment for neighborhood interaction and promoting the cultivation of neighborhood social capital."

"However, the mechanisms of the relationship between neighborhood social capital and the health of urban older people remain to be explored."

"First, in terms of the measurement of neighborhood social capital, this paper focused on offline social capital, but with the increasing number of Internet users, the possible influence of online social capital on the lives, behavior and health of urban elderly also deserves attention, and future studies can pay more attention to the influence of online social capital on the health status of urban elderly."

"Second, due to the limitation of cross-sectional data and potential endogeneity issues as a result of possible omitted variables and the interplay between individual selfrated health and social interactions as well as frequency of interactions, it is actually difficult to verify the causal relationship between neighborhood social capital and self-rated health of urban older adults in this study."
