    "abstractText": "Aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) provide imperative interfaces and compartments in biology, but the sculpture and conversion of liquid structures to functional solids is challenging. Here, inspired by phase evolution of mussel foot proteins ATPS, we tackle this problem by designing poly(ionic liquids) capable of responsive condensation and phase-dependent curing. When mixed with poly(dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride), the poly(ionic liquids) formed liquid condensates and ATPS, which were tuned into bicontinuous liquid phases under stirring. Selective, rapid curing of the poly(ionic liquids)rich phase was facilitated under basic conditions (pH 11), leading to the liquidto-gel conversion and structure sculpture, i.e., the evolution from ATPS to macroporous sponges featuring bead-and-string networks. This mechanism enabled the selective embedment of carbon nanotubes in the poly(ionic liquids)-rich phase, which showed exceptional stability in harsh conditions (10wt%NaCl, 80 C, 3 days) and high (2.5 kg/mh) solar thermal desalination of concentrated salty water under 1-sun irradiation.",

            "text": "Liquid sculpture and curing of bio-inspired polyelectrolyte aqueous two-phase systems\nChongrui Zhang1, Xufei Liu1, Jiang Gong1 & Qiang Zhao 1\nAqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) provide imperative interfaces and compartments in biology, but the sculpture and conversion of liquid structures to functional solids is challenging. Here, inspired by phase evolution of mussel foot proteins ATPS, we tackle this problem by designing poly(ionic liquids) capable of responsive condensation and phase-dependent curing. When mixed with poly(dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride), the poly(ionic liquids) formed liquid condensates and ATPS, which were tuned into bicontinuous liquid phases under stirring. Selective, rapid curing of the poly(ionic liquids)rich phase was facilitated under basic conditions (pH 11), leading to the liquidto-gel conversion and structure sculpture, i.e., the evolution from ATPS to macroporous sponges featuring bead-and-string networks. This mechanism enabled the selective embedment of carbon nanotubes in the poly(ionic liquids)-rich phase, which showed exceptional stability in harsh conditions (10wt%NaCl, 80 oC, 3 days) and high (2.5 kg/m2h) solar thermal desalination of concentrated salty water under 1-sun irradiation.\nThe formation of interfaces and compartments between immiscible liquids plays crucial roles in engineering and lives1\u20134, such as the broad use ofwater ~ oil emulsions5,6. In addition towater ~ organics twophase systems, Beijerinck et al. discovered that two aqueous solutions can be immiscible depending on structures and concentrations of polymers and macromolecules dissolving in each phases7,8. These systems are termed as aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS), which differ from classic water ~ oil emulsions since NO organic solvents are involved in ATPS. Early examples of ATPS include mixtures between polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran aqueous solution9, and/or PEG/gelatin solutions10. Complex coacervates, formed due to electrostatic interactions betweenoppositely chargedpolyelectrolytes, are also seen as a sub-class of ATPS, since immiscible aqueous phases are formed as well11\u201313. Research in ATPS have been developed rapidly, allowing for versatile applications encompassing encapsulation14,15, microfluidics16, wet adhesives17,18, and interfacial reactions19, etc.\nSince water is the only solvent in biology, it has been expected that ATPS should play crucial roles in biological systems20, e.g., all aqueous cellular compartments might possibly be governed by ATPS mechanisms. Such imaginations have not been concretely verified, until recent studies showing that proteins and polynucleotides form ATPS both in vivo21 and in vitro22. For example, intrinsically disordered proteins form ATPS condensates23, serving as membrane-less organelles21 that determine pathology24 and biology functionalities25,26. Compared to ATPS made from synthetic polymers, ATPS existing in biology are defined by stimuli-responsive phase status and cross-phase evolution. That is, both the phase status and microstructures of ATPS are tunable and curable to fit task-specific purposes, an intriguing ability arising from the complicated chemical structures and supramolecular interactions of proteins27\u201329. For example, mussels hang themselves to underwater rocks through mussel foot threads and plaques25,30, which are characterized by high strength, extensibility, and abrasion resistance31. Mussel threads are formed through two crucial steps: first, the responsive formation of self-coacervate (i.e., ATPS) of mussel foot proteins (mfps) mixtures in the groove mold, and second, the pHdependent curing and microstructure replication of mfps ATPS32,33. Interestingly, hierarchical pores are found in mussel threads and plaques, which improve wet adhesion strength34. While the mfps ATPS are formed through cation ~\u03c0 interaction35, coacervate curing is associated with the oxidative crosslinking of catechol groups32. Other than these understandings, little is known about how the ATPS\u2019 liquid phases evolve in seawater. In a broader context,most of current research focus\nReceived: 7 December 2022\nAccepted: 21 April 2023\nCheck for updates\n1Key Laboratory of Material Chemistry for Energy Conversion and Storage (Ministry of Education), School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, PR China. e-mail: zhaoq@hust.edu.cn\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2456 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\non liquid-status of ATPS, and it remains elusive to translate their liquid structures to functional solids36,37. To these ends, polymers analogous to mfps should be designed to engineer ATPS curing, but it is a grand challenge to resemble protein\u2019s functionality with simplified polymers and synthesis38,39.\nPoly(ionic liquids) (PILs) is a sub-class of polyelectrolytes synthesized by the polymerization of ionic liquid monomers40,41. Considering the rich variety of ionic liquids, PILs are known for their structure versatility and rich supramolecular interactions at inter-/intra chain levels42. Recently we shown that supramolecular interactions among phenyl-containing poly(ionic liquid) copolymers could be tuned to prepare coacervate, which fail to cure as phenyl groups are incapable of efficient crosslinking at ambient conditions17. Here we design a task specific PILs which features two unique properties to construct, modulate and sculpture ATPS\u2019 liquid structures. The polymer contains nitrile groups which likely form cation ~ \u03c0 or cation ~ dipole interaction for ATPS, but also undergo efficient cyclization condensation at base conditions. By this design, cross-linkable ATPS and its structure sculpture is rendered possible, leading to the translation of ATPS liquid structures to macroporous hydrogels. Currently,\npolymer hydrogels with hierarchical pore channels are being intensively studied for solar thermal evaporation43,44. These hydrogels were normally prepared by template methods or repeated freezing drying processes, followed by crosslinking to improve their water stability45\u201347. Through the structure sculpture and curing of ATPS, in this work PIL macroporous hydrogels were rapidly prepared at room temperature, which show structure stability and anti-salt properties. Moreover, carbon nanotubes (CNT) were selectively sequestered in the PIL phase, thus conferring good light absorption to the hydrogel. The resultant polyelectrolyte sponge show high (2.5 kg/m2h) and stable solar thermal desalination performance under 1-sun irradiation."

Recent studies show that the cation ~ \u03c0 interactions between lysine (R) and tryptophan (F) amino acids drive the formation of mfps ATPS in seawater35,50. Then the catechol moieties (Y) in mfps undergo self-oxidative polymerization which convert ATPS to solid threads and plaques51. The formation and\nmerging of two droplets.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2456 2\nevolution of mfps ATPS proceed step-by-step at ambient conditions33. We confer the stimuli responsive ATPS and curing properties to one single polymer, such as poly(1-cyanomethyl-3-vinylimidazolium bromide) (abbreviation: PILCN1, see Supplementary Figs. 1\u20134 for monomer and polymer synthesis). The PILCN1 contains \u03c0 electrons (nitrile) and cations (imidazolium) which would undergo cation ~ \u03c0 or cation ~ dipole interactions, while nitrile groups are activated for cyclization crosslinking when they are attached to cations through methylene spacers52. It is the first time that nitriles are exploited for such interactions and polymer condensation. Other cationic polyelectrolytes, e.g., poly(dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride) (abbreviation: PDDA) was selected as complementary polymers for ATPS.\nPILCN1 and PDDA were dissolved in water to prepare solutions (Fig. 1b). A turbid dispersion (Fig. 1c) was obtained when the PILCN1 solution (1mL, 100mg/mL) was mixed with PDDA solution (1mL, 60mg/mL). After 5 h standing, liquid-liquid phase separation was observed and the bottom phase appears yellowish (Fig. 1d) and fluidic (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Movie 1). Cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) characterizations (Fig. 1f) show that the turbid dispersion consists of micron-scale droplets with relatively broad size distributions. These droplets are mainly spherical (Fig. 1g), and some of them are fusing together to form bigger droplets (Fig. 1h, arrow). The fluidity and droplet fusion were also visualized in situ by optical microscopy (Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary Movie 2), in agreement with cryo-SEM results. These results confirm the formation of PILCN1-PDDA ATPS.\nPhase diagramof the PILCN1-PDDAmixturewas studiedbymixing equal volume of PILCN1 and PDDA solutions (Fig. 2a). The critical concentration of PILCN1 solution for the solution-to-ATPS transition is inversely correlated to the PDDA concentration, which is consistent with typical phase diagrams reported in literature53. Then the PILCN1 concentration was fixed at 100mg/mL, and the effect of PDDA concentration in compositions of the bottom and top phases of corresponding ATPS were characterized (Supplementary Tables 1, 2). When PDDA concentration of the starting solution increases from 50mg/mL to 100mg/mL, the PILCN1: PDDA ratio in the bottom phase increases from 4.59 to 18.53, while that in the top phase decreases from 1.14 to 0.11 (Fig. 2b). That is, there is less PDDA dissolving in the bottomphase (PILCN1-rich) whenmore PDDA wasmixed with PILCN1, and vice versa for PIL dissolving in the top phase (Supplementary Fig. 6).\nFrom the Raman characterization of ATPS (Fig. 3a), PDDA shows peaks at 784 cm\u22121 and 578 cm\u22121, which are assigned to C-H vibration of -CH3 and -CH2\n\u2212, respectively. Meanwhile, PILCN1 shows characteristic peaks at 2265 cm\u22121 and 675 cm\u22121, which are attributed to nitrile groups and the out-of-plane bending of imidazole rings (C-Hring), respectively. Interestingly, the 2265 cm\u22121 and 675 cm\u22121 peaks decreases and increases, respectively, despite the constant PILCN1 solution concentration. The intensities of both peaks are positively related to the electron density of nitrile groups and imidazole rings54. As such, the decreasing and increasing intensity of 2265 cm\u22121 and 675 cm\u22121 peaks suggest that the electrondensity of nitrile groups and imidazole ringswere reduced and increased, respectively. Such changes indicate the increasing interaction between imidazolium and nitrile, whereby electrons were shifted from nitriles to imidazolium. To support this explanation, a control PIL (abbreviation: PILeth) containing an ethyl (instead of nitrile) wasmixed with PDDA, forming a homogenous solution instead of ATPS (Supplementary Fig. 7). In this case, intensity of the 675 cm\u22121 peak is stable with increasing the PDDA concentration (Fig. 3b, c), which indicates negligible interactions due to the absence of nitrile groups.\nTo further verify the supramolecular interaction between nitrile and imidazolium groups, PILCN1-PDDA solution mixture was characterized by 2D 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence (1H-13C HSQC), which can demonstrate intermolecular correlation signals between different groups. As seen in Fig. 3d, the black arrow indicates the intermolecular correlation peak between the 13C moiety of nitriles (115 ppm) and 1H moieties of imidazole rings (7.5 ppm). This signal confirms a nanometer-scale proximity between the nitriles and imidazole cations55, which indicates an attractive interaction between nitrile groups and imidazolium."

The interaction was initially counteracted by the charge repulsion between likely-charged PILCN1, thus a homogenous PILCN1-PDDA solution form at lower polymer concentration (Supplementary Fig. 7). When PDDA concentration in starting solutions increases, the ionic strength in the mixture increases, and screens charge repulsion between PILCN1 chains11,13. Hence the cation ~ \u03c0 interaction become\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2456 3\neffective to trigger the self-association of PILCN1, leading to the separation of PILCN1-rich (bottom) and PDDA-rich (top) phases.\nAccording to this mechanism, the presence of nitrile groups in PILs are indispensable to drive the cation related interaction andATPS. Another four PILs were synthesized (Fig. 4b), with nitriles attached to imidazolium rings (PILCN1 ~ PILCN3) and quatenrized ammonium (PILCN4). All these PILCNx (x: 1 ~ 4) formATPSwith three other cationic polyelectrolytes (PDDA, PAE, and PTMAC) at proper concentrations (see Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9 for ATPS characterizations). By contrast, the PILeth polymer, containing NO nitrile groups, forms homogeneous solution with all cationic polyelectrolytes at similar concentrations (Fig. 4b). As further verification of the mechanism, a PILCN1-PDDA solution was turned into ATPS by adding salts into the solution (Supplementary Fig. 10). This is because the added salts screen charge repulsion between PILCN1 chains, which renders the attractive interactions between PILCN1 effective for self-condensation of PILCN1."

Compared with both the pristine PILCN1 and PDDA, a new FT-IR peak around\n1695 cm\u22121 was seen from lyophilized PILCN1-PDDA hydrogel (Fig. 5b). This peak is assigned to the vibration of -C =N in triazine rings52, and verifies the occurrence of cyclization reactions of nitriles in PILCN1 during the shaking process. The hydrogel shows good stability in organic solvents (Supplementary Fig. 11), and it was not self-healing due to the covalent crosslinking. Water can be reversibly squeezed out/in from the hydrogel depending on external pressure (Supplementary Fig. 12). Interestingly, both the pristine PILCN1 or PDDA solution alone remain solution state at identical conditions (Supplementary Fig. 13), and the gelation occurred only when PILCN1-PDDA formed ATPS (Supplementary Fig. 14). As shown in Fig. 5a, PILCN1PDDA ATPS forms up on mixing the two polymers (a-1), and the two fluidic phases were sculptured into bicontinuous phases during the shaking (a-2). Through the formation of ATPS, importantly the concentration of PILCN1 in condense phase is improved to 248mg/mL, one time higher than the maximum concentration (110mg/mL) of PILCN1 that are dissolvable alone in water at 20 \u00b0C. The higher concentration of PILCN1 is beneficial and imperative for nitrile cyclization, which facilitates the rapid and selective curing of PILCN1-rich phase under base conditions (a-3, Fig. 5b), allowing for the ATPS ~ hydrogel conversion.\nFreshly prepared hydrogel (without water washing) was characterized in situ by laser confocalfluorescentmicroscopy, underwhich\nPDDA (30mg/mL).\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2456 4\nPILCN1 is luminescent (Supplementary Fig. 15) while PDDA is not. The orange color in Fig. 5c represents the PILCN1-rich phase, which appear continuous and account for ~13% of the overall area, close to the volume ratio of PILCN1 (Supplementary Table 1). Zoom-in observation (Fig. 5d) shows that the orange phase consisted of round-shaped, interconnected microbeads (dashed line) that are 1\u20133 microns in size. The lyophilized hydrogel (without wash) shows micro-bead structures that are vaguely visible (arrow, Fig. 5e), as they are covered by PDDA polymers (Fig. 5f). These results verify the formation of PILCN1-PDDA bicontinuous phases during the shaking of ATPS. Alternatively, freshly preparedhydrogelwaswashedbywater, lyophilized and characterized by SEM. From Fig. 5g, the hydrogel shows a sponge-like, macroporous structures, in which the network skeleton consists of interconnected microbeads. Such microstructures were stable after immersing the hydrogel in water (pH 11) for extended time (Supplementary Fig. 16). Figure 5h, i show morphology details of microbeads and how they merge. These beads correspond to the PILCN1-rich phase, which was shaped and rapidly cured while the coexisting PDDA-rich phase was removed during the water wash. As such, the liquid structure of ATPS was sculptured efficiently.\nThe structure sculpture of PILCN1-PDDA ATPS was further exploited by incorporating task-specific nanofillers. CNTs were dispersed in both the PILCN1 and PDDA solution, and mixed to form ATPS (Fig. 6a).\nSimilar to results in Fig. 1f, dropletswere seen (Fig. 6b, c), corresponding to the PILCN1-rich phase. Interestingly, the PILCN1-rich droplets are black, forming a clear boundary (dash line, Fig. 6c) with PDDA-rich phase. After standing for 10 h, the bottom phase is black, while the top phase is light yellow and transparent, containing very little CNTs (Supplementary Fig. 17). These results show that CNTs are selectively condensed in the PILCN1-rich phase. TEM characterizations show that both thepristineCNTdispersion andPDDA@CNTdispersion consist of clean CNTs with little decorations by polymers (Fig. 6d, e). When it comes to the PILCN1@CNT dispersion, CNTs were covered by more PILCN1 (Fig. 6f), indicating thatCNTshave stronger interactionwithPILCN1 that is more hydrophobic compared to PDDA56.\nThe PILCN1-PDDA ATPS was cured at pH 11 to prepare CNTcontaining hydrogels (abbreviation: CNT-hydrogel). Compression strength of the CNT-hydrogel with 0.65wt% CNT is about 60 kPa and shows exceptional recovery with little hysteresis in 50 cycles of repeated tests (Supplementary Fig. 18). As shown in Fig. 6g, morphology of the CNT-hydrogel is analogues to that of the CNT-free hydrogel (Fig. 5g), i.e., it also features bead (1\u20134\u03bcm)-thread networks and sponge-like pores (10\u201330\u03bcm). Such macroporous structures could facilitate the rapid transport of water in the hydrogel (Supplementary\nFig. 19). Figure 6h shows the connection of various microbeads, which is due to the droplet fusion arrested by the rapid curing. The tight\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2456 5\nembedment ofCNTs in PILCN1-richphasewas clearly verifiedbyzoomin examinations (Fig. 6i), while NO CNTs were seen in the void space outside of the PILCN1 phase. Moreover, the PILCN1-PDDA-CNT ATPS microbeads were freezing dried to visualize the internal structures of particles. Figure 6j shows that CNTs were seen both at the particle surface and inside it, and a closer observation indicates that more CNTs were dispersed at the surface region of the particle (Fig. 6k). Thus the added CNTs could stabilize PILCN1 droplets via the Pickering effect. This result indicates the stable incorporation of CNTs in the hydrogel, which is beneficial for solar-thermal desalination under harsh conditions.\nThe proof-of-concept utility of CNT-hydrogel was evaluated by solar thermal evaporation. Effects of CNT content in evaporation rate of CNT-hydrogels were studied, and the CNT content was chosen as 0.65wt% (Supplementary Fig. 20). At this condition, the CNT-hydrogel displays an effective light absorption (95%) in the UV-Vis-NIR regions, which is likely due to the fine dispersion of CNTs and themultiply light reflection among surfaces of microbeads (Supplementary Fig. 21). Under 1-sun irradiation, the surface temperature of CNT-hydrogel floating on water rises to 52 \u00b0C in 2min, and then stabilizes around 57 \u00b0C (Fig. 7a), 50% higher than that of the pure water (38 \u00b0C). The water evaporation rate of CNT-hydrogel is ~2.5 kgm\u22122 h\u22121 at 1-sun irradiation, ca. 11 times and 4 times of the pure water evaporation in dark (0.23 kgm\u22122 h\u22121) and under 1-sun irradiation (0.62 kgm\u22122 h\u22121), respectively (Fig. 7b). The water evaporation rate and microstructure of CNT-hydrogel are stable (Supplementary Fig. 22). On basis of these evaporation data, the solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency of CNThydrogel is calculated to be ~95%. Figure 7c shows that the evaporation enthalpy ofwater inCNT-hydrogel is 1.8 kJ g\u22121, ~20% reduced compared to that of the bulk water (2.2 kJ g\u22121). When it comes to real seawater\nwashed by water for 5 h prior to the lyophilization.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2456 6\ndesalination, the CNT-hydrogel displays stable evaporation rate (2.5 kgm\u22122 h\u22121) in 10 days running (Fig. 7d, Supplementary Fig. 23). During the seawater evaporation, no salt crystals were seen from the CNT-hydrogel surfaces (Supplementary Fig. 24). Meanwhile, Fig. 7e shows that the concentrations of four major ions (Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+) in condensed water are below the drinking water standards defined by the Word Health Organization (1000mgL\u22121) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (500mgL\u22121)57.\nThe salt concentration in water was further increased to 10wt% (ca. 3 times as concentrated as seawater), and the CNT-hydrogel shows impressive evaporation stability (2.4 kgm\u22122 h\u22121) in 12 tests (Fig. 7f). During the evaporation, only a small amount of salt crystals appeared on hydrogels, which quickly dissolved (Supplementary Fig. 25), indicating that the gel shows good self-cleaning property (Supplementary\nFig. 26). The anti-salt and self-cleaning properties of CNT-hydrogels likely arise from the sponge-like pores that accelerate the diffusion and convection of salts, and PILCN1\u2019s positive charge that inhibits salt\ncrystallization58,59. In addition, CNT-hydrogel survives the 3-days brine heat treatment (10wt%NaCl, 80 \u00b0C), with little-to-no CNTs washed out of the hydrogel (Supplementary Fig. 27). This exceptional stability arises from the covalently crosslinked PILCN1-rich phase. Considering the high evaporation rate and stable performance in high salinity water, the CNT-hydrogel represents one of the top tier performances among carbon-loaded polymer composites60, holding considerable potential for solar thermal desalination.\nThis work engineers the formation and structure sculpture of ATPS between likely charged polyelectrolytes, leading to the efficient preparation of functional hydrogels. When charge repulsion between PILCN1 was screened by external ionic strength, cation-related supramolecular interactions between imidazolium and nitriles drive the selfcondensation of PILCN1, leading to the liquid-liquid phase separation of PILCN1 from PDDA. The ATPS evolve into bicontinuous phase structures during shaking, and the concentration of PILCN1 in the PILrich phase is two times as high as the maximum concentration of PILs\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2456 7\ndissolvable in water alone. As such, the rapid curing of PILCN1-rich phase was rendered possible through the nitrile condensation at base conditions, resulting in macroporous hydrogels reassembling morphologies of PILCN1 droplets. CNTs were selectively embedded in PILCN-rich phase, and the hydrogel shows high (about 2.4 kg/m2h) solar thermal desalination under 1-sun irradiation. This work shows a paradigm shift in designing responsive ATPS whose liquid structures are modulated and sculptured by pH and salt stimuli."

As prepared CNT-hydrogels were used for solar thermal steaming tests.\nSolar thermal evaporation measurements The solar thermal steaming measurement was conducted by a solar light simulator (CEL-S500L) at 30 oC and 50% relative humidity. Typically, the CNT-hydrogels were put on the surface of a 0.5 cm thick polystyrene foam, which was employed as the thermal insulating layer and wrapped by hydrophilic cotton to facilitate water transport. The mass change of water wasmeasured by an electronic balance (JA2003, Soptop). The evaporation rate (kg/m2h)was calculated by: Evaporation rate =\u0394m \u2044 (S*t). In this equation, \u0394m is the mass change of water during 1 h evaporation under 1-sun irradiation, S is the area (m2) of the material for evaporation, and t represents the time of solar irradiation. The calculation of evaporation enthalpy was given in Supplementary Information (section 1.6)."
