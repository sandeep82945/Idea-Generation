    "abstractText": "We investigate the Higgs transition within the four-dimensional SU\u00f02\u00de-Higgs model in search for an order parameter as a function of the Higgs field hopping parameter, \u03ba, using lattice technique. We measure the Higgs condensate after applying Landau gauge fixing and study the corresponding susceptibility, magnetization, and fourth order Binder cumulant using four different spatial volumes with N\u03c4 1\u20444 2. The computation is carried out with gauge coupling, \u03b2g 1\u20444 8, for a range of scalar self-coupling, \u03bb 1\u20444 f0.00010; 0.00350g, with an emphasis near the critical end point. Finite size scaling analysis of the gauge fixed condensate and its cumulants agree with the standard 3D Ising values \u03bd 1\u20444 0.62997, \u03b2=\u03bd 1\u20444 0.518, \u03b3=\u03bd 1\u20444 1.964 at \u03bb 1\u20444 0.00150. These results are in agreement with previous studies suggesting 3D Ising universality class. The numerical results also indicate that, at the transition point, the gauge fixed condensate vanishes in the infinite volume limit.",

INTRODUCTION\nThe understanding of the phase structure of SU\u00f02\u00deHiggs theory has crucial cosmological and experimental consequences [1\u20134]. Over the years, several nonperturbative lattice studies have been devoted in this regard [5\u201329] (for reviews, please see [30\u201332]). These studies find that the nature of Higgs transition varies with Higgs quartic coupling (\u03bb). With an increase in \u03bb, the strength of this transition weakens and eventually becomes a crossover for large \u03bb. The first order transition and crossover regions are separated by a second order critical end point at \u03bbc [23]. There are similar examples in QCD, spin models, condensed matter systems etc. where lines/surfaces of the second order transition separate first order and crossover regions in the phase diagram [33\u201335]. Many attempts have been made to study the universality class of such critical end points in different theories [9,33\u201335]. These end points are expected to belong to the universality class of the Ising model [9,34\u201340]. In the electroweak theory, the critical end point in the dimensionally reduced SU\u00f02\u00de-Higgs theory is studied in three dimensions [9]. The analysis of the critical behavior is done by identifying energy and magnetization like observables [35]. The distribution of these observables,\nhigher cumulants and the extracted critical exponents, clearly show that the end point is in the 3D Ising universality class. In Ref. [9], a linear combination of various gauge\ninvariant observables plays the role of magnetization. Another orthogonal linear combination plays the role of an energylike observable. These linear combinations change with the bare parameters of the theory. Though gauge invariant observables can be used to study nature of transitions, it is desirable to have an order parameter for the Higgs transition. In the absence of gauge symmetry, the Higgs condensate (volume average of the Higgs field) plays the role of an order parameter. On other hand, gauge symmetry renders the condensate unphysical. However, it can be made well behaved by a suitable choice of a gauge. It is expected that the choice of a gaugewill not affect physical quantities such as critical exponents. Note that the necessity of a suitable order parameter exists in other gauge theories, such as in high density QCD, to describe the normal color superconducting transition. In the present work, we propose the Higgs condensate in the Landau gauge, denoted by \u03a6g, as an order parameter for the Higgs transition in SU\u00f02\u00de-Higgs theory. In 3\u00fe 1 dimensions, \u03a6g and its cumulants are computed using a Monte Carlo simulation of the partition function by varying the Higgs hoping parameter (\u03ba) and the quartic coupling. It is observed that the partition function average of\u03a6g behaves similar to that of magnetization in spin models. For small \u03bb, the Higgs transition is of first order, and \u03a6g is found to vary discontinuously across the transition point. With the increase in \u03bb, the Higgs transition weakens, which is also seen in \u03a6g behavior.

At a critical point \u03bbc, \u03a6g varies continuously while its various cumulants show singular behavior. The observed scaling behavior is consistent with the 3D Ising universality class and deviates from the universality class of the 3D O\u00f04\u00de spin models [41,42]. The Finite Size Scaling (FSS) of\u03a6g suggests that it vanishes at the critical point in the infinite volume limit. It also vanishes in the high temperature or Higgs symmetric phase at least for \u03bb < \u03bbc. Wewould like to mention here that\u03a6g, as an order parameter, reasonably reproduces the previous results. A linear combination along the lines of previous studies may further fine-tune the results. The draft is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we provide the lattice definition of the SU\u00f02\u00de-Higgs theory. In Sec. III, we discuss the numerical procedures for our work. This includes the Landau gauge fixing in lattice. In Sec. V, we analyze our data using FSS, while we present the magnetization study at various \u03bbs in Sec. VI. Finally, we present the discussion and conclusion of our study in Sec. VII."

            "text": "For Monte Carlo simulations, we use the pure gauge part of the publicly available MILC code [43] and modify it to accommodate the Higgs fields. To update the gauge fields, we first use the standard heat bath algorithm [44,45], and then update Higgs fields using a pseudo heat bath algorithm [13]. We then again update the gauge fields using four overrelaxation steps [46] after which Higgs fields are updated again using pseudo heat bath algorithm. To reduce autocorrelation between successive configurations, we carry out 50 cycles of this updating procedure between two subsequent measurements. We test our codes to reproduce histogram profiles similar to Ref. [22]. For our simulations, we use four spatial volumes, Ns \u00bc 20, 24, 32, 40, while the temporal lattice extent is kept at N\u03c4 \u00bc 2 [23].

One of the methods is the standard SU\u00f02\u00de subgroup method, and the other one is Overrelaxed Steepest Descent method. This was done to check whether both the methods arrive at the same global maxima. In addition, we use single, double, and quadruple precisions in our simulations so that we are able to set our convergence conditions accordingly. We find that both the methods for maximization of H as well as the different precisions produce similar results. Eventually, as described in [47], we combine both SU\u00f02\u00de subgroup and Overrelaxed Steepest Descent methods to speed up gauge fixing. First, we apply SU\u00f02\u00de subgroup method to bring the configuration close to the maximum, and then apply Overrelaxed Steepest Descent method for the final convergence. We set our overrelaxation parameter, \u03c9 \u00bc 1.98, and we use double precision for all our simulations.

We focus our studies at \u03bb \u00bc 0.00116, 0.00132, and 0.00150. For each of them, we generate 2.5 million trajectories out of which gauge fixing is performed on every 50th trajectory at each \u03ba. This gives us a total 50 000 gauge-fixed configurations for each \u03ba. The parameters are listed in Table I. For each of other values of \u03bb, we generate 500 000 trajectories instead out of which every 50th trajectory is selected for gauge fixing giving 10 000 gauge-fixed configurations for each \u03ba. The reduced statistics is due to the limitations in computational resources. The parameters are listed in Table II. All the error analyses in this study are carried out using Jackknife method with bin size determined such a way that the total number of bins is 100.\nIV. M-LIKE AND E-LIKE OBSERVABLES\nThe SU\u00f02\u00de-Higgs theory is similar to the case of the liquid-gas system, i.e., none of the gauge invariant observables can be directly identified with the M-like and E-like observables. In the previous studies of the critical end point, observables such as SK \u00bc\nP x;\u03bc Tr\u00f0\u03d5\u2020xUx;\u03bc\u03d5x\u00fe\u03bc\u0302\u00de, S\u03d5 \u00bcP\nx \u00f012Tr\u00f0\u03d5\u2020x\u03d5x\u00de \u2212 1\u00de2 etc. have been used to define the M-like and E-like observables. It has been pointed out that SK , S\u03d5 etc. are not necessarily orthogonal in the vicinity of the critical point, i.e., h\u0394SK\u0394S\u03d5i \u2260 0, where \u0394SK \u00bc SK \u2212 hSKi and \u0394S\u03d5 \u00bc S\u03d5 \u2212 hS\u03d5i [9,34,35,37\u201339]. However, linear and orthogonal combinations of them have been found to behave as M-like and E-like observables. In the present work, we include the Landau gauge fixed Higgs condensate, \u03a6g, along with other gauge invariant observables to define M-like and E-like observables. The studies of correlations between \u03a6g and other gauge invariant observables seem to suggest that h\u0394\u03a6g\u0394SKi \u2248 0 and h\u0394\u03a6g\u0394S\u03d5i \u2248 0 are satisfied within the uncertainties. We compute the correlation relations, h\u0394\u03a6g\u0394SKi and h\u0394\u03a6g\u0394S\u03d5i, over the whole range of respective \u03ba values at \u03bb \u00bc 0.00116 and 0.00150. They are plotted in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. We clearly see that there is no correlation between the\u03a6g and other observables. We also observe that\nTABLE II.

This suggests that \u03a6g is a M-like observable. We also study the behavior of the \u03a6g distributions vs SK as well as S\u03d5 distributions. In Fig. 3, we plot \u03a6g vs SK and S\u03d5 for \u03bb \u00bc 0.00116 and \u03ba \u00bc 0.129465. In Fig. 4, the same\nquantities are plotted for \u03bb \u00bc 0.001500 and \u03ba \u00bc 0.129765. From these figures, we see that these distributions behave similarly to those of energy vs magnetization distributions of the 3D Ising model. Note that \u03a6g has four components. The individual components have no physical significance, as\n014513-4\nthere are no Goldstone modes in this case. The magnitude of \u03a6g is physical and as a consequence, we can only reproduce the part of the Ising model figure for which M > 0. In Figs. 3 and 4, we observe that the distributions are not linear, unlike the distribution of Sk vs S\u03d5. In this situation, no unique linear combination is possible."

We see that \u03ba acts like an \u201cinverse temperature\u201d [48] for all the\n014513-5\nfour quantities, and there are indications that these four quantities behave similar to that of Ising model. However, it is necessary to study further by scaling all the four\nquantities with the standard Ising exponents and see whether the scaled quantities follow the FSS behavior. In order to carry out the scaling procedure, the corre-\nsponding critical value of \u03ba needs to be evaluated. To find \u03bac, we first estimate the value of \u03c7cmax for each volume and obtain the corresponding \u03ba\u03c7max. The standard procedure to find \u03c7cmax is the Rewieghting method. It can be seen from Fig. 5(b) that we have a reasonable amount of data near the peak point for every volume. Thus, we instead use the Cubic Spline Interpolation method to generate a few hundred points close to \u03ba\u03c7max for every Jackknife sample. From these sets of interpolated points, we find the values of \u03c7cmax and the corresponding \u03ba\u03c7max for each volume. The value of \u03bac is then obtained by using the following FSS relation given by\n\u03ba\u03c7 \u22121 max \u00bc \u03ba\u22121c \u00fe aN\u22121=\u03bds : \u00f012\u00de\nBy using the standard value of \u03bd \u00bc 0.629971 for 3D Ising model, we get the value of \u03bac from the linear fit of \u03ba\u03c7max as a function of N\u22121=\u03bds as (see Fig. 6)\n014513-6\n014513-7\n014513-8\n\u03bac \u00bc 0.1294655\u00f05\u00de: \u00f013\u00de\nUsing the value of \u03bac from Eq.

It can be clearly seen from Fig. 7 that quantities do not\nproperly obey the scaling behavior. The differences are\nmore visible in the cases of susceptibility and Binder cumulant. Further, no improvement in the scaling is seen by changing the universality class. We thus extend our study to other \u03bb values for which scaling can be seen. We considered two other values of \u03bb, namely \u03bb \u00bc 0.00132 and 0.00150, which are around \u223c1\u03c3 and \u223c2\u03c3 from \u03bb \u00bc 0.00116, respectively.\n014513-9\nB. \u03bb= 0.00132 and 0.00150\nWe compute magnetization, susceptibility, total susceptibility and Binder cumulant for \u03bb \u00bc 0.00132 and 0.00150. They are plotted in Figs. 8 and 10, respectively. We again see Ising-like behavior of these quantities. Note that the value of \u03bac changes with the value of \u03bb. We follow the same procedure as described in Sec. VA to determine \u03bac for \u03bb \u00bc 0.00132 and 0.00150. Thus, we get,\n\u03bac \u00bc 0.1296071\u00f08\u00de for \u03bb \u00bc 0.00132; \u00f014\u00de\n\u03bac \u00bc 0.1297642\u00f07\u00de for \u03bb \u00bc 0.00150: \u00f015\u00de\nUsing these values of kc and the standard values of the exponents for 3D Ising model, we scale the quantities as in Sec. VA. They are plotted in Figs. 9 and 11, respectively. By comparing Figs. 7, 9, and 11, we see scaling for \u03bb \u00bc 0.00150. This is an indication that \u03a6g is a good order parameter. Also this suggests that the critical end point is close to \u03bb \u00bc 0.00150."

We study the magnetization for various \u03bb values between f0.0001; 0.0035g. The simulation parameters for this study are listed in Table II. As mentioned in Sec. III, the number of configurations is restricted to 10 000 only for each combination of \u03bb and \u03ba. From Figs. 12(a) and 12(b) at \u03bb \u00bc 0.00010 and 0.00050, respectively, we clearly see that \u03a6g displays a first order transition as a function of \u03ba. Finally, we see from Figs. 12(g) and 12(h) that the volume dependence nearly disappears at the values of \u03bb \u00bc 0.00310 and 0.00350, respectively, indicating a crossover. We also evaluate \u03ba\u03c7maxs from the maximum value of susceptibility for Ns \u00bc 40 for \u03bb \u00bc f0.0008; 0.0035g. They are plotted in Fig. 13."

            "text": "In this work, we study the behavior of the volume average of the Landau gauge-fixed \u03a6g and related quantities in SU\u00f02\u00de-Higgs theory. The aim of our study is to see if \u03a6g behaves like an order parameter for the Higgs transition. We consider \u03b2g \u00bc 8 as in [23], and study \u03a6g at various values of \u03bb, from \u03bb \u00bc 0.00010 to \u03bb \u00bc 0.0035. Our results show that, \u03a6g for different \u03bb accurately identifies the transitions points (\u03bacs). Across first order transition, \u03a6g varies discontinuously, as expected from an order parameter. This is clearly seen at \u03bb \u00bc 0.00010 and \u03bb \u00bc 0.00050 in agreement with previous study [23]. From \u03bb \u00bc 0.0008 onward, we see a weakening of transition, with the jump in\u03a6g decreasing with \u03bb. At much higher values of \u03bb, such as \u03bb \u00bc 0.00310 and \u03bb \u00bc 0.00350, we see a gradual disappearance of volume dependence signifying a possible crossover. It is interesting to note that a different lattice study [49] at zero temperature performed at \u03b2g \u00bc 8, \u03bb \u00bc 0.0033, \u03ba \u00bc 0.131 with a lattice size of 243 \u00d7 48 has found the physical Higgs mass to be 123(1) GeV, which is closer to the experimental value. A significant part our numerical simulations are devoted to study behavior of \u03a6g near the end point. The magnetization, susceptibility, total susceptibility, and Binder cumulant etc. of \u03a6g as functions of \u03ba give an impression of an order parameter like behavior at \u03bbc. The scaling of these quantities for \u03bd \u00bc 0.62997, \u03b2=\u03bd \u00bc 0.518, and \u03b3=\u03bd \u00bc 1.964, shows that the end point belongs to the 3D Ising universality class. From the scaling of the Binder cumulant from Fig. 11(d), we find its value at \u00f0\u03bbc; \u03bac\u00de to be consistent with the standard 3D Ising value of \u223c0.47 [50,51]. We mention here that the FSS of \u03a6g and its various\ncumulants suggests that the 3D Ising-like behavior seen close to \u03bb \u00bc 0.00150, which is within 2\u03c3 of the endpoint found in [23]. The FSS of \u03a6g seen in Fig. 11 suggests that exactly at the critical point \u00f0\u03bbc; \u03bac\u00de\u03a6g vanishes. Also the numerical results suggest that for \u03bb < 0 in the Higgs symmetric phase and at \u03bac, \u03a6g vanishes in the infinite volume limit. This is in contrast to behavior of magnetization in the three-state Potts model, where the magnetization vanishes in the symmetric phase only in the absence of an external field. In the presence of external field, in the symmetric phase at transition point, magnetization increases with external field. This behavior of magnetization vs external field can be obtained by adding a simple explicit breaking term to Ginzburg-Landau type of mean field free energy. Such an effective description of \u03a6g require nontrivial term(s) such that \u03a6g is zero in the Higgs symmetric phase at least for \u03bb < \u03bbc."
