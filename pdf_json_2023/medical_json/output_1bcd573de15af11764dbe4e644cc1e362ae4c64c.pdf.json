Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed on bacteria isolated clinically from the lower respiratory tracts of children in our hospital from 2018 to 2021 by the Kirby\u2013Bauer method and automated systems. Results: From 2018 to 2021, the top three lower respiratory tract clinical isolates in our hospital were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae. These three species showed obvious seasonal epidemic patterns, and their numbers decreased significantly during the COVID-19 epidemic, from 4559 in 2019 to 1938 in 2020. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics also changed before and after the COVID-19 epidemic. The annual proportions of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) were 41%, 37.4%, 26.2%, and 29.8%. The resistance rates of Klebsiella pneumoniae to ceftriaxone were 40.5%, 51.9%, 35.3%, and 53.3%, and the detection rates of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) were 2.7%, 11.1%, 5.9%, and 4.4%. The detection rates of b-lactamase-producing H. influenzae were 51.9%, 59.2%, 48.9%, and 55.3%. The rate of MRSA, ceftriaxone-resistantK. pneumoniae, CRKP, and b-lactamase-producing H. influenzae decreased significantly in 2020 compared with 2019, whereas that of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosaand carbapenem-resistantA.baumannii increased. The detection rates of b-lactamasenegative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR) gradually increased over the 4 years. Conclusions: Protective measures against COVID-19, including reduced movement of people, hand hygiene, and surgical masks, may block the transmission of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis and reduce the detection rate of MRSA, ceftriaxone-resistant K. pneumoniae, CRKP, and b-lactamase-producing H. influenzae.",

Our previous surveillance results showed that S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis have been the most frequently detected in our hospital.\nThe aim of this study is to understand the regularity of the prevalence of common lower respiratory tract infections among children in Shenzhen, and the impact of the strict protection in Shenzhen against COVID-19 on the distribution and resistance of these bacteria.\nWhat was learned from the study?\nS. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, and H. influenzae have obvious seasonal epidemic patterns, and, during the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020, their number dropped significantly compared to 2019 (S. pneumoniae: 801 vs. 1 545; M. catarrhalis: 783 vs. 1 273; H. influenzae: 354 vs. 1 741), the detection rates of b-lactamasepositive H. influenzae, ceftriaxoneresistant K. pneumoniae, MRSA, and CRKP also decreased. However, compared to 2020, antimicrobial resistance of most bacteria in 2021 still continue to rise, despite normalized prevention and control measures.\nWe can block the spread of common bacteria through protective measures during the epidemic season of community-acquired lower respiratory tract. However, to block the spread of nosocomial-acquired lower respiratory tract infection bacteria (including multidrug-resistant bacteria), it is still necessary to strengthen the prevention and control of nosocomial infection and the rational use of antibiotics for a long time."

            "text": "Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in late 2019, the global public health system has faced unprecedented challenges, and different countries have instituted different anti-epidemic policies. China implemented strict anti-epidemic policies; for example, Wuhan\u2019s lockdown measures from January 23 to April 8, 2020 blocked large-scale spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Shenzhen also invoked strong epidemic prevention and control measures, including strict implementation of temperature monitoring, working remotely from home, suspending school classes, staying home unless otherwise necessary, washing hands frequently, and wearing surgical masks. The above measures may effectively block the transmission of infectious diseases and change the distribution of pathogenic bacteria. As the only large-scale public children\u2019s hospital in Shenzhen, we have observed that the distribution and antibiotic resistance of pathogens isolated from the lower respiratory tract in our hospital has changed since the outbreak.\nTherefore, we here report data for the periods January 2018\u2013December 2019 (before the COVID-19 epidemic), January 2020\u2013May 2020, and May 2021\u2013June 2021 (during the COVID-19 epidemic), and June 2020\u2013April 2021 and July 2021\u2013December 2021 (normalized COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control) to help understand and block the spread of bacteria causing lower respiratory tract infections in children."

The trend for S. pneumoniae was similar to that for H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis but was more complex, exhibiting a greater number of peaks (Fig. 1)."

            "text": "To explore how COVID-19 measures may have impacted pathogen distribution, we examined lower respiratory tract specimens from pediatric patients at our hospital for the presence of various bacteria. According to reports [7], infectious diseases accounted for six of the top ten causes of disability-adjusted life-years in children under 10 in 2019, of which lower respiratory tract infections ranked second. New infectious disease pathogens often emerge, and previous infectious disease pathogens often resurface. Since 2017, we have been working on the distribution of clinically isolated bacteria in children in Shenzhen as well as on monitoring antimicrobial resistance. Previous research has shown that S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis have always been among our hospital\u2019s top three bacterial isolates [8, 9]. The present study indicates that these three bacteria are still common pathogens causing communityacquired lower respiratory tract infections in children in Shenzhen, with apparent seasonal patterns.

This may be because the strengthened prevention against COVID-19 in Shenzhen (including working remotely from home, suspending school classes, staying home unless otherwise necessary, washing hands frequently, and wearing surgical masks) blocked the spread of these three bacteria. Among them, since January\u2013May 2020 (during the COVID-19 epidemic) is the peak season of H. influenzae in previous years, the number of H. influenzae (354) detected in 2020 has dropped to the lowest level in 4 years, but the peak period of the prevalence of S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis is not during this period. As a result, the proportion of H. influenzae detected in 2020 is 15.4%, which is significantly lower than that in 2018, 2019, and 2021 (29.1\u201335.2%). Related studies of some viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection have reported similar results [10]. The number of pathogenic bacteria isolated from the lower respiratory tract in February in each of the 4 years evaluated was significantly lower than that in January. The main reason may be that the traditional Spring Festival in China tends to occur in February. Shenzhen is a large immigrant city, and many people return to their hometowns during the traditional Spring Festival, and, because many families leave Shenzhen for the holiday, there are fewer children, including those with respiratory tract infections, in the city during this period. During the COVID-19 epidemic, the detection rates of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii, which mainly cause nosocomial pneumonia [11], did not decrease significantly. Previous studies have shown that these two bacteria are often colonized in hospital plumbing and medical environments, spreading through contact to cause nosocomial infections in ICU patients [12, 13]. Respiratory protection measures against COVID-19 are usually not feasible in ICU patients, and standard hand hygiene, healthcare environment disinfection, and contact isolation measures may be more critical for reducing nosocomial infections of these two bacteria.

Additionally, developing new antibiotics usually requires considerable time and cost, which constrains clinicians with regard to treating many patients infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria. Due to the toxic side effects of antibiotics, the use of antibiotics in pediatrics is limited, and treating multidrug-resistant infections in children is more challenging than it is in adults. The results of our study show that S. pneumoniae in children with lower respiratory tract infections in Shenzhen maintains high sensitivity to penicillin, which can be used as the first choice for clinical treatment. The detection rate of MRSA also exhibited a downward trend, similar to the China antimicrobial surveillance network (CHINET) report [14], at less than 30% in the past 2 years. The resistance mechanism of H. influenzae to b-lactam antibiotics is mainly due to TEM or BOR-producing b-lactamase and decreased affinity caused by mutation of the ftsI gene, which encodes penicillin-binding protein 3 [15, 16]. The proportion of b-lactamase-producing H. influenzae isolated in our hospital was approximately 50\u201360%, and the resistance rate to ampicillin exceeded 60%. However, BLNAR, which exploits the decrease in affinity caused by ftsI gene mutation as the b-lactam antibiotic resistance mechanism, is resistant to a variety of b-lactam antibiotics [15, 16], and its detection rate increased slowly from 12.8% in 2018 to 18.5% in 2021. The resistance mechanism of M. catarrhalis to b-lactam antibiotics is mainly the production of BRO b-lactamase [17], and no amoxicillin-clavulanic acid-resistant strains were detected.\nThe situation of antibiotic resistance among the Enterobacteriaceae and nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli is severe. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on the threat of antibiotic resistance listed CRE and CRAB as urgent threats and ESBL-producing\nEnterobacteriaceae, multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa, and MRSA as serious threats in 2019 [18]. The surveillance results of CHINET showed that the resistance rates in China of K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii to imipenem increased from 3% and 32.9% in 2005 to 25% and 77.1% in 2018, respectively, and that of P. aeruginosa to imipenem was also approximately 30% [14]. From the perspective of bacterial resistance changes in our hospital, rates of b-lactamaseproducing H. influenzae, ceftriaxone-resistant K. pneumoniae, MRSA, and CRKP detection in 2020 were lower than those in 2019, which may be related to the COVID-19 epidemic; however, rates of CRPA and CRAB detection were higher in 2020 than in 2019 (14.5% vs. 6.6% and 11.1% vs. 5.9%), and the rate of CRAB detection continued to rise to 21.2% in 2021. Although the detection rates of CRKP, CRPA, and CRAB were significantly lower than those reported by CHINET [14], those of b-lactamase-producing H. influenzae, ceftriaxone-resistant K. pneumoniae, MRSA, BLNAR, and CRAB in 2021 all increased compared with 2020.\nDue to the limitation of conditions, we could not simultaneously detect lower respiratory tract infection-related pathogens (such as viruses, mycoplasma, etc.) other than common bacteria during the COVID-19 epidemic. Due to the small number of detections of K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii in each year from 2018 to 2021, our study chose to analyze the antimicrobial resistance of common bacteria by year, instead of separate analyses during the COVID-19 epidemic period and the normalized COVID-19 epidemic prevention period."
