1. **Investigate the use of deep learning techniques for gait recognition.** Deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in a variety of image recognition tasks. It would be interesting to see how these algorithms perform on gait recognition tasks, and whether they can improve upon the accuracy of the proposed FCML-Gait approach.


2. **Explore the use of other biometric modalities in combination with gait recognition.** Gait recognition can be combined with other biometric modalities, such as face recognition or fingerprint recognition, to improve the overall accuracy and robustness of the recognition system. This could be a promising area for future research, as it could lead to the development of more secure and reliable biometric systems.


3. **Develop a real-time gait recognition system.** The proposed FCML-Gait approach is not currently implemented in real-time. However, it would be possible to develop a real-time system by using specialized hardware and software. This would allow the system to be used in a variety of applications, such as security and surveillance.


4. **Investigate the use of gait recognition for other applications.** Gait recognition has the potential to be used in a variety of applications beyond security and surveillance. For example, it could be used to track the movement of people in a building or to identify people who are at risk of falling. It would be interesting to explore these and other potential applications of gait recognition.


5. **Develop a gait recognition system that is robust to changes in clothing and footwear.** The proposed FCML-Gait approach is not robust to changes in clothing and footwear. This is a significant limitation, as people often change their clothing and footwear on a daily basis. It would be interesting to develop a gait recognition system that is robust to these changes, as this would make the system more practical for real-world applications.
