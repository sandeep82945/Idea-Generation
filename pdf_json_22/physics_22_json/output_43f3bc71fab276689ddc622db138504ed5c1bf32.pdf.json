    "abstractText": "Abelian U(1) gauge group extensions of the Standard Model represent one of the most minimal approaches to solve some of the most urgent particle physics questions and provide a rich phenomenology in various experimental searches. In this work, we focus on baryophilic vector mediator models in the MeV-to-GeV mass range and, in particular, present, for the first time, gauge vector field decays into almost arbitrary hadronic final states. Using only very little theoretical approximations, we rigorously follow the vector meson dominance theory in our calculations. We study the effect on the total and partial decay widths, the branching ratios, and not least on the present (future) experimental limits (reach) on (for) the mass and couplings of light vector particles in different models. We compare our results to current results in the literature. Our calculations are publicly available in a python package to compute various vector particle decay quantities in order to describe leptonic as well as hadronic decay signatures for experimental searches.",

            "text": "In recent years MeV-to-GeV scale neutral vector mediators have received a lot of attention being the focus of searches in several present and future experimental programs. In part this is because they can be involved in the solution of some unsolved conundrums we face today. They have been evoked in association with dark matter models [1\u20137], with the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment [8, 9], with the MiniBooNE excess of electron like events [10, 11] and to alleviate the reported tension in the Hubble constant [12]. Theoretically, these vector bosons appear in connection to extensions of the Standard Model (SM) where the SM gauge group is supplemented by an Abelian U(1)Q symmetry. The new gauge coupling gQ, charges (Q) and the mass of the vector boson ZQ depend on the particular model realization. The vector mediator can be secluded, when only kinetic mixing with the photon is allowed, or can enjoy direct gauge couplings to SM fermions. In the former case, generally dubbed dark photon, the mediator couples universally to all SM charged fermions and ignores neutrinos. In the latter case, the gauge boson may not only interact with all SM\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 9\nfermions but additional particles, vector-like under the SM symmetry group but chiral-like under U(1)Q. Besides, a judicious choice for the charges is generally required to enforce anomaly cancellation. One can find many limits on the masses and couplings of these particles in the literature. In refs. [13, 14] limits on a few U(1)Q models for a wide range of masses (from 2MeV to 90GeV) were derived or recasted from experimental searches for dark photons. Most of these searches rely on the mediator decays into leptons, either electrons, muons or neutrinos. In some models, the branching ratios into leptons indeed dominate. Nevertheless, for baryophilic vector bosons decays into hadronic final states might have a large share of the total decay width. Especially for a ZQ with a mass in the MeV-to-GeV range, these limits fall in the domain of nonperturbative QCD. Hence, it is important to make sure the hadronic resonances that play an important role in determining the experimental bounds in this region are well described. The main purpose of this paper is to improve this description and provide, for the first time, an almost complete set of ZQ decays into arbitrary leptonic and hadronic final states. This is of consequence as one can, misguided by an incomplete or incorrect theoretical description of the data, exclude regions that are still allowed and perhaps hinder the imminent discovery of a new weak force. Besides, present bounds and future predictions for vector mediator models could, in principle, be complemented by hadronic signature searches. In order to obtain reliable predictions in this low mass region we use a data driven approach fitting e+e\u2212 cross-section data using the meson dominance (VMD) model of chiral perturbation theory. Under this model assumptions we can calculate the decay widths and branching ratios of the new ZQ mediator into hadrons by considering its direct mixing to the dominant vector mesons \u03c1, \u03c9 and \u03c6. A similar approach was also used in [13, 14], but here we improve their implementation in several ways. We explicitly calculate the ZQ width to specific hadronic final states following the same procedure outlined in [3] fitting the available e+e\u2212 data using IMinuit [15]. Many of those fits are based on state-of-the-art hadronic current parametrizations of e+e\u2212 annihilation processes [16, 17], and all fits are updated to the most recent data. Once the hadronic currents for numerous mesonic final states are parametrized and the fit values are fixed, we can couple the weak force to all individual currents. We include several new hadronic channels with respect to [13], especially in the region where there are excited states of the \u03c1, \u03c9, and \u03c6 above 1GeV. The results for the hadronic decays of the new ZQ mediator are provided in the python package DeLiVeR that is available for public use on GitHub at https://github.com/preimitz/DeLiVeR with a jupyter notebook tutorial. This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we introduce a class of baryophilic models that we use throughout the paper. The particular couplings to quarks determines the ZQ decays into light hadrons as described in section 3. In section 4 we discuss how the description of those decays can be improved compared to previous calculations by using the VMD approach with only very little theoretical assumptions. The impact this different approach has on the hadronic widths, the branching ratios, and on the reach of present and future experimental searches for ZQ vector particles is part of section 5. Our conclusion and outlook is presented in section 6.\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 9"

We parameterize this mixing by /(2 cos \u03b8W ) for convenience.\nConsidering 1, we can rotate F\u0302 and Z\u0302 as (see appendix A for details)\nF\u0302\u00b5 \u2192 F\u00b5 \u2212 cos \u03b8W ZQ\u00b5 and Z\u0302Q\u00b5 \u2192 ZQ\u00b5 ,\nin order to define gauge bosons with canonical kinetic terms. This rotation will also impact the neutral bosons interaction Lagrangian so that the relevant terms involving the new physical ZQ boson are\nL0int \u2283 e J\u00b5emZQ\u00b5 \u2212 gQJ \u00b5 QZQ\u00b5 , (2.2)\nwhere e = g sin \u03b8W is the electric charge, g and gQ are, respectively, the SU(2)L and U(1)Q coupling constants and \u03b8W is the SM weak mixing angle. As usual\nJ\u00b5em = \u2211 f f\u0304\u03b3\u00b5 qfem f , (2.3)\nis the SM electromagnetic current, qfem is the fermion f electric charge in units of e, and\nJ\u00b5Q = \u2211 f f\u0304\u03b3\u00b5 qfQ f , (2.4)\nis the new vector current, with qfQ being the Q-charge of fermion f .

We will assume e gQ, so when charges are present we will neglect the kinetic mixing contribution. Because our main focus here are the hadronic modes for a light ZQ with mZQ in the MeV-to-GeV range, we will consider a class of anomaly-free baryophylic models where only three right-handed neutrinos were introduced to the particle content of the SM [19].

            "text": "In the mass range of interest of this paper, a ZQ can decay into charged or neutral leptons as well as into light hadrons, if kinematically allowed. In the following, we describe its partial decay widths into these channels.\n(a) Leptonic decays. The ZQ partial decay width into a pair of leptons is given by\n\u0393(ZQ \u2192 `\u00af\u0300) = C`(gQq`Q)2\n12\u03c0 mZQ\n( 1 + 2 m 2 `\nm2ZQ )\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a1\u2212 4 m2` m2ZQ , (3.1)\nwhere m` is the lepton mass, C` = 1 (1/2) for ` = e, \u00b5 (\u03bde, \u03bd\u00b5, \u03bd\u03c4 ), gQ is the U(1)Q gauge coupling and q`Q the corresponding lepton charge of the model according to table 1. For the dark photon we have to replace gQ with e and q`Q with q`em = \u22121 for all charged leptons as neutrinos do not couple to Z\u03b3 . When mZQ < 2me, the new boson ZQ can also decay into three photons. The decay width for this process can be found in [20]. Nevertheless, the partial decay width for ZQ \u2192 3\u03b3 is negligibly small for the models and mass range of interest in this paper and hence, we refrain from including it into our calculations.\n(b) Hadronic decays. The region 0.5 . mZQ/GeV . 2 is plagued by hadronic resonances and perturbative QCD does not provide a reliable way to evaluate vector boson decays into hadrons, so here one has to, instead, turn to chiral perturbation theory [21]. We will use the so-called vector meson dominance model [22\u201324], which successfully describes e+e\u2212 annihilations into hadrons and has been also applied more recently to BSM\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 9\nphysics [13, 25], to estimate ZQ \u2192 H, where H is a hadronic final state made of light quarks, via mixing with QCD vector mesons.\nLet\u2019s explain briefly how VMD works to describe low-energy QCD. In a nutshell, in the context of SM interactions, VMD splits the electromagnetic light quarks current into three components, the isospin I = 0, I = 1 and the strange quark currents, and identifies them, respectively, with the vector mesons \u03c9, \u03c1 and \u03c6 [26]. The same result can be obtained by incorporating dynamical gauge fields V\u00b5 of a local hidden symmetry U(3)V [27\u201331] into the chiral Lagrangian [21, 28]. Linear combinations of these gauge fields will then describe the vector mesons. The vector mesons subsequently interact with other vector mesons V \u2032 and pseudoscalar mesons P through the anomalous Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) V V \u2032P interactions [28, 29, 31].\nWith the most prominent example being the SM photon, U(1) gauge symmetric fields, such as ZQ\u00b5, enter this pure QCD Lagrangian as external fields through the covariant derivative of the pseudoscalar Goldstone matrix of the chiral Lagrangian [21]. Additional WZW terms [32, 33] are constructed to fully describe the meson sector such as, for example, the \u03c00 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay. Whereas in the low-energy limit those U(1) gauge fields interact directly with the pseudoscalar mesons, they dominantly mix with vector mesons in the hadronic resonance region. Hence, we only have to specify the vector meson-gauge field mixing term. Its most general form is given by2\nLV ZQ = 2 gQZ \u00b5 QTr [ V\u00b5Q f ] , (3.2)\nwith V \u00b5 = T aV a,\u00b5, where T a are U(3) generators. In our case Qf is a diagonal matrix with entries equal to the U(1)Q charges qu,d,sQ . For the dark photon Z\u03b3 one can simply take gQ \u2192 e and qfQ \u2192 qfem.\nThe observed vector mesons of the SM are given by\n\u03c1 : \u03c1\u00b5T\u03c1 = \u03c1\u00b5 1 2diag(1,\u22121, 0) ,\n\u03c9 : \u03c9\u00b5T\u03c9 = \u03c9\u00b5 1 2diag(1, 1, 0) , \u03c6 : \u03c6\u00b5T\u03c6 = \u03c6\u00b5 1\u221a 2 diag(0, 0, 1) . (3.3)\nOnce the vector mediator ZQ has converted into a SM vector meson, the V V \u2032P interactions, e.g. the \u03c1\u03c9\u03c0 vertex, determine their decays. These interactions are encoded in QCD formfactors F (q2). The low-energy limit of chiral perturbation theory is always recovered in the VMD model by making F (q2)\u2192 1 for q2 \u2192 0. All form-factors can be obtained from fits to e+e\u2212 \u2192 H data. The cross-section results are typically displayed as the ratio over the muonic annihilation channel as\nRH\u00b5 \u2261 \u03c3(e+e\u2212 \u2192 H)\n\u03c3(e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212) . (3.4)\n2For alternative definitions see [26].\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 9\nThis common rescale of the results for vector portal models is justified since initial state dependencies cancel in the above ratio. As in the dark photon model, the coupling structure is inherited from the SM photon with a proportionality factor , we can hence model the dark photon decay widths simply by directly rescaling the experimentally known ratios RH\u00b5 [exp] \u2261 \u03c3(e+e\u2212 \u2192 H)/\u03c3(e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212)|exp as\n\u0393Z\u03b3\u2192H = \u0393Z\u03b3\u2192\u00b5+\u00b5\u2212R H \u00b5 [exp]. (3.5)\nAlthough this strategy works well for the dark photon, it cannot be employed anymore when dealing with vector mediators with a coupling structure that is not proportional to the SM photon-quark one. In this scenario the couplings to SM vector mesons need to be determined by eq. (3.2). For instance, in all the models of interest in this paper, ZQ couples to B, so the quark U(1)Q charge matrix takes the form Qf = diag(1/3, 1/3, 1/3). In this case the trace for the \u03c1 meson will be zero and hence, only the \u03c9 and \u03c6 mesons will contribute to describe the ZQ decay into hadrons in RH\u00b5 . Therefore, for generic U(1)Q models, an accurate division of the hadronic channels into their \u03c1, \u03c9 and \u03c6 contributions is of extreme importance in order to obtain the correct description of the hadronic decay widths. In previous studies the VMD approach has been employed with many simplifications and considering a limited number of hadronic channels [13]. These approximations propagate to the width and branching ratio calculations, and can even affect the final experimental bounds in the model parameter space. Next we present a more complete and robust evaluation of various hadronic contributions."

The hadronic current, which includes a form-factor FH, depending on H, can be written as\nJ\u00b5P1P2 = \u2212(p1 \u2212 p2) \u00b5FP1P2(q2), J \u00b5 P\u03b3 = \u03b5 \u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3q\u03bd\u03b5\u03b3,\u03c1p\u03b3,\u03c3FP\u03b3(q2), (4.2) J\u00b5V P = \u03b5 \u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3q\u03bd\u03b5V,\u03c1pP,\u03c3FV P (q2), J\u00b5P1P2P3 = \u03b5 \u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3p1,\u03bdp2,\u03c1p3,\u03c3FP1P2P3(p1, p2, p3) , (4.3)\nwhere P(1,2,3), V, \u03b3 indicate, respectively, the presence of a pseudoscalar meson, a vector meson, or a photon in the final state. The corresponding momenta are labeled accordingly. The photon and vector meson polarizations are given by \u03b5\u03b3/V,\u00b5 and \u03b5\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 is the antisymmetric Levi-Civita tensor. For the pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar current, the pseudoscalarphoton current and the pseudoscalar-vector current, we have q = p1 + p2, q = pP + p\u03b3 and q = pP + pV , respectively. For channels with two pseudoscalars and one vector meson, as in the case of \u03c9\u03c0\u03c0 and \u03c6\u03c0\u03c0, we refrain from parametrizing the hadronic current in terms of intermediate substructures like \u03c9f0 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0\u03c0 due to dissenting data observations [35, 36]. Hence, we assume a point-like interaction and write the hadronic current as\nJ\u00b5V P1P2 = ( g\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 q \u00b5q\u03bd\nq2\n) \u03b5\u2217V,\u03bdFV P1P2(q2) , (4.4)\nwith q = pV + p1 + p2. For channels with more than 3 final states, we directly take expressions from the literature as given in table 3. In order to calculate the decay width of a vector mediator, we simply replace the leptonic current by the polarization vector of the mediator L\u00b5 \u2192 \u03b5\u00b5(ZQ) to obtain the matrix element for the decay, so\nMZQ\u2192H = \u03b5\u00b5(ZQ) \u2211 V r(V )J\u00b5H(V ) , r(V ) = gQTr\n[ TVQ f ]\nTr [TVQem] , (4.5)\nwith the factor r(V ) rescaling the photon-meson coupling to the mediator-meson coupling with the vector meson resonance V , in this case V = \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c6 with generators TV as given in eq. (3.3). The dependence on the vector meson resonances \u03c1, \u03c9 and \u03c6 will appear in the formfactors FH. The dominant vector mesons for a particular channel can be identified using isospin-symmetry assumptions and G-parity conservation. The particular form of these form-factors can be found in [3] and in appendix B. In this work, we include the cross-sections for the four most important hadronic contributions close to the \u03c1, \u03c9, and \u03c6 masses as well as the 4\u03c0 and KK\u03c0 channels that are already part of DarkCast (see table 2), but also consider several new hadronic channels (see table 3) using recent data for the parametrizations. Some of those additional new channels are taken from [3], and are complemented by new fits to other channels not considered before in the energy range closer to \u223c 2GeV. Table 3 summarizes all additional channels and specifies the vector resonances used in the fit as well as possible final state configurations.\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 9\n0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 s [GeV] 10 4 10 3 10 2\n10 1\n100\n101 102 R = (e + e ) (e + e + )\n= + = + 0 0 = + + = + 0\n= 0 = KK = KK\nPDG data\nFigure 1.

The solid (dashed) lines indicate results obtained in this work (taken from DarkCast [13]). The data (black points) was taken from the Particle Data Group compilation (PDG) [34]. See text for discussions on the differences.\n(b) Improvements on the description of the dominant low-energy hadronic modes. For energy ranges around the ground state vector meson masses, the final states \u03c00\u03b3, \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212, \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03c00, KK and KK\u03c0 dominate the cross-section. For higher energies we also include the contribution from e+e\u2212 \u2192 4\u03c0. Those channels are very precisely measured and have been also considered by DarkCast. In table 2, we list the assumptions for resonant contributions and its differences to DarkCast, the data used, and references for the parametrizations and fits. In figure 1, we show our results (solid lines) for these modes and compare them to the state-of-the-art results from DarkCast (dashed lines). Whereas the results are similar around the \u03c1 and \u03c9 masses, channels including the \u03c6meson give different results. Below, we summarize the main improvements and explain the differences for these channels introduced in our work:\n\u2022 In the \u03c00\u03b3 channel, besides the \u03c9-like components we include a \u03c6 and a small \u03c1 contribution. The \u03c6, in particular, accounts for a second peak around its mass near 1GeV (see pink solid line in figure 1) and for the broadening of the \u03c9 peak. Especially in the low-energy limit, below ' 0.6GeV, this might have some significant effect if no other hadronic states contribute to the overall decay width of the vector mediator. In the particular case of a B vector boson model, this modification will visibly affect branching ratios, and hence, may modify model limits.\n\u2022 Regarding the KK channel, we fit both the charged K+K\u2212 and neutral K\u03040K0 components separately, instead of taking KK = 2 K+K\u2212 as in the DarkCast code.\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 9\na DarkCast takes into account higher resonances in an approximate way by adding a non-resonant background function to mimic the shape of the data, whereas we stick to the VMD assumption and calculate each channel by considering resonance contributions.\nThe latter calculation leads to the overestimation of the total KK cross-section (see dashed green line in figure 1). We also consider the contributions from \u03c1-like, \u03c9-like and \u03c6-like mesons, and not only from \u03c6. The inclusion of these other mesons may have an important impact for models that do not couple to the \u03c1 current, such as the baryophilic ZQ models considered here.\n\u2022 Finally, the KK\u03c0 channel can be decomposed into three components H = K0K0\u03c00, K+K\u2212\u03c00 and K\u00b1K0\u03c0\u2213. In DarkCast these components are not considered individually. Instead, only the isoscalar component of the KK\u03c0 channel has been taken into account. The isoscalar and isovector contributions can be extracted from the sub-process e+e\u2212 \u2192 K\u2217(892)K, e.g. in the analysis of e+e\u2212 \u2192 K\u00b1K0\u03c0\u2213 [37]. However, this is a two-body process, and therefore has different kinematics compared to a three-body final state. So in order to correctly describe the kinematics of KK\u03c0 we need to make the decomposition into the three final states. Moreover, we take into account the \u03c1-like and \u03c6-like contributions, while DarkCast assigns the whole [KK\u03c0]I=0 as a \u03c6-like channel. The difference between these calculations can be seen in figure 1 (purple lines).\n(c) Higher resonance effects. The even more challenging energy region starts above the \u03c6 mass and includes processes involving excited states of the vector mesons \u03c1\u2032, \u03c9\u2032, \u03c6\u2032. The only channel that is rather straightforward to be implemented is the \u03c1 meson dominated 4\u03c0 channel with form factors as given in ref. [47] (see navy blue and cyan lines in figure 1). Other processes, especially vector mediator decays to currents involving \u03c9 and \u03c6 contributions, are only poorly described in the literature. We introduce a large amount of new channels in order to accurately describe the region above & 1.5 GeV. To reduce the vast amount of possible final states, we identify common substructures of some channels.\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 9\nchannel resonances data parametrization fit possible final states \u03b7\u03b3 \u03c1, \u03c1\u2032, \u03c9, \u03c6 [62] [62] [62] 3\u03b3, 3\u03c0\u03b3,. . . \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0 \u03c1, \u03c1\u2032, \u03c1\u2032\u2032 [63, 64] [65] [3] 2\u03c02\u03b3, 5\u03c0,. . . \u03c9\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\u03b3 \u03c1, \u03c1\u2032, \u03c1\u2032\u2032 [66] [66] [66] 2\u03c0\u03b3 \u03c9\u03c0\u03c0 \u03c9\u2032\u2032 [35, 36, 67] new new 5\u03c0, 3\u03c0\u03b3 \u03c6\u03c0 \u03c1, \u03c1\u2032 [37, 68] [3] [3] 2K\u03c0, 4\u03c0,. . . \u03b7\u2032\u03c0\u03c0 \u03c1\u2032\u2032\u2032 [35] [65] [3] 4\u03c02\u03b3,. . . \u03b7\u03c9 \u03c9\u2032, \u03c9\u2032\u2032 [69] [3] [3] 2\u03c02\u03b3, 6\u03c0, . . . \u03b7\u03c6 \u03c6\u2032, \u03c6\u2032\u2032 [37, 70] [3] [3] KK2\u03b3,KK3\u03c0, . . . pp\u0304/nn\u0304 \u03c1, \u03c1\u2032, . . . , \u03c9, \u03c9\u2032,. . .

Additional processes included in this work that are not present in the DarkCast code [13]. We denoted channels where a tower of vector meson resonances was considered with \u2018. . . \u2019. For the cases where the parametrization and fit are marked as \u2018new\u2019, we provide details in appendix B.\nFor example, the channel \u03b7\u03c9 can produce 2\u03c02\u03b3 and 6\u03c0 final states,3 whereas \u03c9\u03c0\u03c0 can contribute to 5\u03c0 and 3\u03c0\u03b3. All considered channels and some of their possible final state configurations are listed in table 3. Including additional channels has a significant effect on the total e+e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons cross-section. As seen in figure 2, the sum of the new contributions to the hadronic crosssection increases up to a level where it contributes as much as the so far considered channels at around \u221a s . 2 GeV (purple line). For center-of-mass energies \u221a s & 1.4 GeV, the RH\u00b5 line continues to follow the PDG-data to higher energies and captures the effects of excited states of the \u03c1, \u03c9, and \u03c6 mesons. One can also see from figure 2 that the addition of the new channels \u03c9\u03c0\u03c0, 6\u03c0, \u03c6\u03c0\u03c0 and K\u2217K\u03c0 are important especially in the region near 2GeV where they dominate. The \u03c9\u03c0\u03c0 (\u03c6\u03c0\u03c0) channel correspond to a neutral and a charged contribution, \u03c9\u03c00\u03c00 (\u03c6\u03c00\u03c00) and \u03c9\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 (\u03c6\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212), respectively. The 6\u03c0 channel can also be split into two components, 3(\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212) and 2(\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03c00), while the K\u2217K\u03c0 can be split into four components, K\u22170K\u00b1\u03c0\u2213, K\u2217\u00b1K0S\u03c0\u2213, K\u2217\u00b1K\u2213\u03c00 decaying into K0SK\u00b1\u03c0\u2213\u03c00, and K\u22170K\u2212\u03c0+ decaying into K+K\u2212\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212. More details about these channels can be found in appendix B.\n(d) Final \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c6 decomposition. In order to calculate decay widths for arbitrary vector mediator models, it is useful to split up the hadronic current in its \u03c1, \u03c9 and \u03c6 contributions as given in eq. (3.2). The quark coupling matrix Qf determines if a certain vector meson contribution is present or absent (Tr [ TVQ f ]\n= 0). We can clearly see in figure 3 that the different treatment of the \u03c00\u03b3, KK, and KK\u03c0 channels translate into a\n3Even though the \u03b7\u03c9 \u2192 6\u03c0 contribution is expected to be subdominant [93].\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 9\n0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 s [GeV] 10 4 10 3 10 2\n10 1\n100\n101 102 R = (e + e ) (e + e + )\nall channels old channels new channels\n= + + = = \u2032 = = = pp + nn = = 6 = = K *\nPDG data\nFigure 2.

Since we include a lot more channels in the range above \u2265 1.5GeV, we also get enhanced \u03c9 and \u03c1 contributions. For vector mediator models with only \u03c9 and \u03c6 couplings, like for example all the B-coupled models considered in this paper, this will result in different branching ratios into hadronic final states.\nDue to the fact that in the SM the photon mixes with all vector mesons, in the ideal case we expect the \u03b3-line to follow the PDG data [34]. As seen in figure 3, we can accurately describe the \u03b3-like until around \u223c 1.7GeV. While the \u03b3-line is almost but not fully overlapping with the e+e\u2212-data, we have a more solid description of the separate vector meson contributions due to our approach of summing up all dominant meson channels with subsequent \u03c1, \u03c9, and \u03c6 vector meson structures.\nEspecially in the case of the \u03c9 and \u03c6 contributions, the vector meson contributions differ from the calculations of [13] for vector mediator masses above the \u03c6 meson mass, as well as in the low-energy region of the \u03c9 contribution due to differences in the \u03c00\u03b3 channel. In which way this affects the branching ratios, limits and predictions will be discussed in section 5.\n(e) Hadron-quark transition.

Although we have included all the available data of the exclusive channels listed in PDG [34], our results could be improved with better knowledge of the processes and the channels substructures. Also, the inclusion of more data related to final state configurations in the region closer to 2GeV would improve even more the reach of our \u03b3-like curve. Possible new channels could be easily added in our approach. Nevertheless, we expect that in that mass range, the annihilation processes slowly transition into perturbative quark production where we have RH\u00b5 \u2192 Rem = Nc \u00b7 \u2211 f (qfem)2 = 2 for the SM with Nc = 3, quem = 2/3 and qd,sem = \u22121/3. In accordance with the PDG [34], we take\nR(Q) = Rem(1 + \u03b4QCD(Q)) , (4.6)\nincluding QCD corrections \u03b4QCD(Q) that are described in more detail in the QCD review of [34]. As a consequence, due to the lack of sufficient data, the \u03b3-like curve in figure 3 will be replaced by a perturbative line at RH\u00b5 ' 2. For the dark photon model this transition is made at 1.7GeV, whereas for B-coupled models it is at 1.74GeV. These specific values for the threshold energies were chosen in the intersection between the perturbative quark width, calculated using eq. (4.6) and the width to muons, and the hadronic width, such that the transition can be done smoothly.\n(f) Error estimate. The uncertainties in our calculation of hadronic decays of light vector mediators emerge from uncertainties from the fits to electron-positron data. As in ref. [3], we define a sub-set of the free fit parameters for each channel and vary their mean values within the uncertainty provided by our IMinuit [15] fit or as stated in the papers.\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 9\n0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 mZB [GeV] 10-15\n10-13\n10-11\n10-9\n10-7\n\u03c4 Z B\nB Model\n1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7\n10-15\nFigure 4. Uncertainty on the ZB mediator lifetime obtained by propagating the cross-section fit envelopes into the hadronic width computation. The red curve is the ZB lifetime evaluated by considering the best fit parameters for each hadronic channel width, while the orange region represents the envelope lifetime uncertainty estimate. The large uncertainties below \u223c 0.6 GeV are caused by the lack of \u03c0\u03b3 experimental data in this region. For the regions where data is available, the uncertainties always stay below the 10% level, as we can see in the zoomed in plot. We considered gB = 10\u22124 for the lifetime calculation, we remark, however, that the mediator coupling does not affect the uncertainties. The vertical dashed grey line indicates the hadron-quark transition.\nFor more details about the uncertainty estimates for the individual channels, we refer to ref. [3]. We obtain envelopes around the mean values for the e+e\u2212 cross-section data and propagate those parameters to calculate the enveloping curves of the hadronic widths and related quantities. In figure 4 we show in which way this affects the ZB mediator lifetime. As we can see, below the pion threshold, the ZB mediator decays into leptons, which can be calculated perturbatively and, hence, no error bars are included. In the mass region just above the pion threshold up to around 600MeV the only channel present is H = \u03c0\u03b3. The large uncertainties in this region are justified since no data is available in this mass range as seen in figure 16 of appendix B. In an obvious way, our data-driven estimates could be, therefore, improved if new data were available below 600MeV, in particular for the \u03c0\u03b3 channel as it is the dominant hadronic channel in this region for B-coupled models. Around and above the \u03c1, \u03c9 and \u03c6 resonances, the uncertainties lie below the 10% level. The uncertainties will be even smaller for other quantities like the branching ratios as they would affect both nominator and denominator of the ratio. Furthermore, we choose the B model as an example since errors would be, if at all, mostly visible for models that do not couple to the precisely measured 2\u03c0 and 4\u03c0 currents with small uncertainties as well as to leptons, which would dominate the lifetime computation for masses away from the resonance peaks. Since the theoretical uncertainties are already well below the 10% level for most of the mass range for the lifetime of this model, we refrain from further including them for all other quantities presented in the course of this paper.\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 9\n0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 mZQ [GeV] 10 2 10 1\n100\n101\n12 (Z\nQ ha\ndr on\ns) /g\n2 Qm Z Q\nZQ = Z\nZQ = B-coupled models\nthis work DarkCast\nFigure 5.

The reason for that is related to the fact that, due to the inclusion of a small number of hadronic channels in [13], the authors considered the following strategy to reach the total RSM\u00b5 curve: they take their \u03b3-like curve to be the PDG curve above 1.48 GeV and their calculation below this energy. Then, they define their \u03c1-like curve to be described\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 9\nby the 2\u03c0 and 4\u03c0 channels below 1.1 GeV and to be the \u03b3-like curve, with the \u03c9 and \u03c6 contributions subtracted, above it. On the one hand, the method described above allowed their \u03b3-like curve to match the RSM\u00b5 experimental calculation. On the other hand, this approximation makes the wrong assumption that all the other neglected hadronic channels contribute as \u03c1 components. As a result, we can see from the figure that right before the transition the red solid line is larger than the dashed one, since baryophilic models do not couple to the \u03c1 current, which means for DarkCast that all the other possible hadronic channels that they did not consider will not couple to the ZQ bosons of these models. We can also see that, for the case of the B-coupled models, the dashed line becomes a straight line close to the transition. This behavior is a consequence of the \u03c9 and \u03c6 contributions, that also transition to perturbative values close to 1.6 GeV and 1.7 GeV, respectively. However, the red solid line establishes a little bit above the dashed one due to our inclusion of QCD corrections in eq. (4.6). Another aspect that is important to highlight is the difference for low energies. The two red lines differ close to 0.6 GeV as a result of the divergences in the calculation of the \u03c0\u03b3 channel, as explained in the previous section. This specific channel has a great impact because is the first hadronic channel that couple to the baryophilic model currents. As we will see next, the branching ratios will also modify as a consequence of the above mention disparities."

In figure 6 in the top panel of each model, we show the branching ratios into e+e\u2212 (light blue), \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212 (blue), neutrinos (green) and hadrons (red) as a function of the mass of the vector boson. The solid (dashed) lines represent the results of our (previous) calculations. In the bottom panel of each plot we show the branching ratio difference between the two calculations. We show, for reference, the Z\u03b3 case as well as the pure ZB. In the Z\u03b3 case, DarkCast predicts a larger branching ratio into hadrons than us in the range 0.25 . mZ\u03b3/GeV . 1.8, but the difference is always less than 5%. The discrepancy between the two calculations for ZB is, on the other hand, more visible for 0.2 . mZB/GeV . 0.4 because the previous calculation underestimates the \u03c00\u03b3 contribution (see section 4, paragraph (b)). In this region, the difference can be as large as \u223c 30%. In spite of the fact that for larger values of mZB the hadronic branching ratios seem to coincide, we see in the left panel of figure 7 that the contributions of each hadronic mode is quite different.

For KLOE we also use data for the search \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7ZQ , ZQ \u2192 e+e\u2212 [114]. In Belle-II, one searches for ZQ \u2192 invisible (\u03bd\u03bd\u0304) [115];\n5. ZQ produced in pp collisions at the LHCb experiment either by meson decays or the Drell-Yan mechanism with the subsequent displaced or prompt decay ZQ \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212 [116, 117];\n6. ZQ produced in kaon decay experiments via \u03c00 \u2192 \u03b3ZQ followed by the prompt decay ZQ \u2192 e+e\u2212 at NA48/2 [118] or by ZQ \u2192 invisible (\u03bd\u03bd\u0304) at NA62 [119].\nWe start by presenting the differences on the limits for the U(1)B model as it highlights the consequences of the improvements of our calculations. In all the plots in blue (green) we show the exclusion regions for ZQ decaying to e+e\u2212 and \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212 pairs (neutrinos). In figure 8 we show in blue the recasted limits for various experiments using our calculations. In gray we can see an extra region that would be excluded by DarkCast, but not by this work. This is particularly visible for 0.2 . mZB/GeV . 0.4 where the underestimation of the \u03c00\u03b3 contribution in the previous calculation yields to an enhanced ZB \u2192 e+e\u2212 signal prediction. There are also regions where our calculation results in an increase of the exclusion bounds. For instance, we show in figure 8 in gray the contour for the NuCal limits obtained with DarkCast. As one can see, there is a region previously allowed that we can exclude now. This effect is also a consequence of the difference in the lifetime calculation, that is more prominent for the B model, and has a deep impact specially for beam-dump experiments. There are, however, two caveats here. The first is the fact that the model is anomalous. As it has been shown in refs. [120, 121] light vectors coupled to SM particles and nonconserved currents enhance the rate of meson decays such as B \u2192 KZB and K\u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0\u00b1ZB as well as the Z boson decay Z \u2192 \u03b3ZB. Those limits mostly lie in areas that have been covered by LHCb with the exception of filling unconstrained areas in the vector meson resonance region. Furthermore, the future B \u2192 KZB prediction is expected to cover a sizable part of the region 0.5 GeV . mZB . The second is related to the coupling to leptons, as for all experimental limits the light vector boson is supposed to decay to e+e\u2212 and/or \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212 (BaBar and LHCb). Although ZB does not couple directly to charged leptons, there is a one-loop induced kinetic mixing between ZB and the photon [122]. However, the magnitude of this coupling will depends on the choice of the renormalization scale so it cannot be determined unambiguously. In the DarkCast code, which we use, it is taken to be simply egB/(4\u03c0)2, so the limits involving this coupling to charged leptons have to be regarded with caution. Next we show the exclusion regions for some of the models we have considered. Although in the case of current limits, the differences caused by our calculations are not very\n\u2013 18 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 9\n10-1 100 mZB [GeV] 10-6 10-5 10-4\n10-3\n10-2\n10-1\n100\n101\ng B\nB Model A1APEX BaBar vis\nCHARM\nE137\nKLOE ll\nLHCb \u00b5\u00b5\nLHCb \u00b5\u00b5\nLSND\nNA48\nNuCal\nPS191\nB\u2192KZB\nB\u2192KZB (fut)\nZ\u2192\u03b3ZB\nK\u2192\u03c0ZB\nFigure 8.

In figure 9 we show the exclusion region for ZB\u2212L in the plane gB\u2212L\u00d7mZB\u2212L . Here the differences are small as they practically do not affect ZB\u2212L \u2192 e+e\u2212, \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212 and \u03bd\u0304\u03bd. However, since this model is of great interest and we have some recent data from LHCb, NA62 and NA64, we decided to present here. We also include for completeness the limits from the neutrino experiments Texono [123, 125, 126] and CHARM-II [124\u2013126] that were taken from [14]. These limits do not depend on leptonic decays and therefore are independent of the hadronic branching ratios. We do not show the limit from the Borexino [127\u2013129] neutrino experiment since the NA64 and CHARM-II limits cover it in the mass range considered in this study. In figure 10 we show the exclusion region for ZB\u22123Le which is similar but does not contain the constraints from LHCb, and KLOE in the \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212 final state. Finally, in figure 11 we show the limits for the B \u2212 Le \u2212 2L\u03c4 model. The B \u2212 3L\u00b5 and B \u2212 L\u00b5 \u2212 2L\u03c4 models only have bounds from LHCb (prompt), NA62 and Belle-II, while the B \u2212 3L\u03c4 model only has bounds from NA62. We do not show them here but refer to [130] for a comprehensive analysis of B \u2212 3Li models.

The aim is to search for long lived particles profiting of the luminosity and boost of the LHC beam. There are two proposed phases for FASER. In the first phase, named FASER, the detector will be 1.5m long with a diameter of 20 cm and will operate from 2022 to 2024 [131], being exposed to an expected integrated luminosity of 150 fb\u22121 [132]. In the second phase, named FASER 2, the detector will be 5m long with a diameter of 2m and is expected to take data in the high luminosity LHC era, being exposed to an integrated luminosity of 3 ab\u22121. Dark photons can be produced by meson decays, pp\u2192 Z\u03b3pp (Bremsstrahlung) as well as by direct production in hard scattering. It is important to highlight that, in contrast to the majority of current experimental searches, that rely on leptonic decay signals, the FASER detector will also be sensitive to hadronic final states. Hence, it is crucial to provide a correct hadronic description in order to precisely compute the experiment expected sensitivity.\nIn figure 12 we show the sensitivity for the B (left panel) and B \u2212 L (right panel) models expected for FASER 2 using the FORESEE code [94] with the implementation of the branching fractions we have calculated.

We also show in the lower part of these plots the difference of the branching ratio between our calculation and DarkCast. Here we can appreciate that although the final sensitive regions do not differ very much from the one predicted by the previous calculation, the contributions from the different final states are not the same.\nThe proposed fixed target facility to Search for Hidden Particles (SHiP) at the CERN SPS 400GeV proton beam [133] is also able to search for dark photons, as well as other vector gauge bosons that couple to the gauged baryon number B, in the GeV mass range. It is expected to receive a flux of 2 \u00d7 1020 protons on target in 5 years. The beam will hit a Molybdenum and Tungsten target, followed by a hadron stopper and by a system of magnets to sweep muons away. The detector consists of a long decay volume that starts at about 60m downstream from the primary target and is about 50m long followed by a tracking system to identify the decay products of the hidden particles, for more details see [134]. At SHiP dark photons can be produced by meson decays, Bremsstrahlung and QCD. By recasting the projected constraints for the dark photon model from Bremsstrahlung production given in figure 2.6 of ref. [133] we compute the sensitivity of other models.\nIn figure 13 we compare the sensitivity of the SHiP Bremsstrahlung production search for ZB (left panel) and ZB\u2212Le\u22122L\u03c4 (right panel) predicted by us (solid light blue) and DarkCast (dashed line). On the bottom panels we show again the difference in the predicted branching ratios between the two calculations. For the B model we also show the corresponding difference in lifetime (\u03b4\u03c4 , in orange). If the lifetime is too short ZB will not be able to reach the detector. So the difference with DarkCast comes from the smaller lifetime (for mZB . 0.5GeV) and larger lifetime (for mZB & 0.5GeV) predicted by our calculation.

We use their projected sensitivity for this invisible decay mode taken from figure 209 of ref. [135] to calculate the sensitivity of models where ZQ \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd\u0304 can occur (invisible searches).\nIn figure 14 we display the predicted sensitivity for Belle II (visible searches) for the B \u2212 L (top left panel), B \u2212 Le \u2212 2L\u03c4 (top right panel) and B \u2212 3Le (bottom panel) models. We predict (solid light blue) for all these models a loss of sensitivity for vector boson masses between 1.5GeV and 1.8GeV, due to an increase of hadronic final states (and consequent decrease of leptonic ones) in this mass window. We also predict a slight increase in sensitivity in other mass regions.\nFinally, in figure 15 we can see the expected sensitivity for Belle II invisible searches for the B\u2212L (left panel) and B\u22123Le (right panel) models. Here again the decrease (increase) of the hadronic final state contributions in certain mass regions, respond for the increase (decrease) of sensitivity of Belle II in the invisible mode according to our assessment.\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 9\n6 \u00d7 10-5\n7 \u00d7 10-5 8 \u00d7 10-5 g B \u2212 L\nBelleII visible - U(1)B\u2212L\n1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 mZB\u2212L [GeV]\n0.1 0.0 0.1 \u2206 B r F=\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212, e + e \u2212F= \u03bd \u03bd\u0304 F= hadrons\n8.5 \u00d7 10-5\n9.5 \u00d7 10-5\n1.05 \u00d7 10-4\n1.15 \u00d7 10-4\ng B \u2212 L e \u2212\n2L \u03c4\nBelleII visible - U(1)B\u2212Le \u2212 2L\u03c4\n1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 mZB\u2212Le \u2212 2L\u03c4 [GeV]\n0.1 0.0 0.1\n1.7 \u00d7 10-5\n1.8 \u00d7 10-5\n1.9 \u00d7 10-5\n2 \u00d7 10-5\n2.1 \u00d7 10-5\n2.2 \u00d7 10-5\ng B \u2212\n3 L e\nBelleII visible - U(1)B\u2212 3Le\n1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 mZB\u2212 3Le [GeV]\n0.1 0.0 0.1\nFigure 14.

            "text": "In this paper we present an improved calculation of the decay width and branching ratios for baryophilic vector boson mediators ZQ, associated with a new U(1)Q gauge symmetry and having a mass in the MeV-to-GeV range, providing for the first time an almost complete set of ZQ decays into arbitrary leptonic and hadronic final states. This is relevant as one can, misguided by an incomplete or incorrect theoretical description of the data, exclude regions that are still allowed and perhaps hinder the imminent discovery of a new weak force in this mass region by future experiments. Furthermore, present and future experiments could, in principle, look for hadronic signatures of these states, in particular close to hadronic resonances. We use a data driven approach fitting e+e\u2212 cross-sections from various experiments and the meson dominance model of chiral perturbation theory to derive reliable predictions. The VMD model allows us to calculate the decay widths and branching ratios of the new ZQ into light hadrons by considering its direct mixing to the dominant vector mesons \u03c1, \u03c9 and \u03c6. This was done before in [13] but we improve their calculation in various ways. We have updated to the most recent e+e\u2212 data (see tables 2 and 3), we included a more complete description of the dominant vector meson contributions, we corrected the KK (\u03c00\u03b3) contribution that was overestimated (underestimated) before, we have considered the individual contributions to the KK\u03c0 channel correctly describing the final state kinematics and we included several new hadronic channels (see table 3), in particular, above 1GeV. See appendix B for further details on the calculations for old and new channels. We discussed the impact of our new calculation on the hadronic decay widths and branching ratios of some baryophilic ZQ models as well as on the current experimental limits on the plane gQ \u00d7mZQ for these models. We also show how some future experiments (FASER 2, SHiP, Belle II) can have their sensitivities affected by our better assessment of the ZQ hadronic modes. The results for hadronic decays of any new ZQ mediator in the MeV-to-GeV mass range are provided for public use in the python package DeLiVeR that is available on GitHub at https://github.com/preimitz/DeLiVeR with a jupyter notebook tutorial. See appendix C for some information of what can be found in our hadronic decay package."

To bring this term to the canonical form we perform the GL(2,R) rotation (\nZ\u0302\u00b5Q F\u0302\u00b5\n) =  1\u221a1\u2212( /cW )2 0 \u2212 /cW\u221a\n1\u2212( /cW )2 1\n(Z\u0303\u00b5Q F\u00b5 ) , (A.2)\nwhere cW = cos \u03b8W , so that for 1 the fields are redefined as\nZ\u0302\u00b5Q \u2192 Z\u0303 \u00b5 Q , F\u0302 \u00b5 \u2192 F\u00b5 \u2212 cW Z\u0303\u00b5Q .

However, although A\u00b5 is already the photon field, Z and Z\u0303Q are still not the physical fields because they are not yet the mass eigenstates. What exactly will happen depends on the structure of the extended scalar sector. To illustrate, let us consider that the scalar that breaks U(1)Q is a singlet. In this case the only source of mass mixing between Z\u0302 (that gets a mass MZ generated by the SM Higgs mechanism) and Z\u0303Q (that gets a mass mZ\u0303Q generated by the singlet vacuum expectation value) is the kinetic mixing\nL0mass = 1 2M 2 ZZ\u0302\u00b5Z\u0302 \u00b5 + 12m 2 Z\u0303Q Z\u0303Q\u00b5Z\u0303 \u00b5 Q ,\n= 12M 2 ZZ\u00b5Z \u00b5 +M2Z tan \u03b8W Z\u0303Q\u00b5Z\u00b5 + 1 2(m 2 Z\u0303Q +M2Z 2 tan2 \u03b8W )Z\u0303Q\u00b5Z\u0303 \u00b5 Q .\n\u2013 26 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 9\nOne can finally bring (Z Z\u0303Q) to the mass basis (Z0 ZQ) by the following rotation( Z\u00b5\nZ\u0303\u00b5Q\n) = (\ncos \u03be sin \u03be \u2212 sin \u03be cos \u03be\n)( Z0\u00b5\nZ\u00b5Q\n) , (A.7)\nwith\ntan 2\u03be = 2 tan \u03b8W1\u2212 \u03b42 +O( 2) , with \u03b4 \u2261\nm2 Z\u0303Q\nM2Z .\nFor , \u03b4 1 we have \u03be \u2248 \u2212 tan \u03b8W (1 + \u03b42) which leads to\nZ\u0303\u00b5Q \u2192 \u2212\u03be Z 0\u00b5 + Z\u00b5Q , Z \u00b5 \u2192 Z0\u00b5 + \u03beZ\u00b5Q .

            "text": "In this appendix we provide additional details concerning the hadronic calculation described in section 4.\n(a) Dominant low-energy hadronic modes. In section 4, we highlight the improvements obtained by using our VMD calculation compared to the old channels already included in DarkCast. Specially for the case of the \u03c00\u03b3, KK and KK\u03c0 channels we show that considerable differences appear. These divergences arise mainly because of the inclusion of other vector meson components, but also as a result of the use of additional data in our fits. In the left panel of figure 16, we show our (DarkCast) R-ratio calculation for the \u03c0\u03b3 channel in solid (dashed) pink together with the experimental data points from the SND collaboration [38]. In the right panel of the same figure, we show the decomposition of the \u03c0\u03b3 ratio into \u03c1 (blue), \u03c9 (red) and \u03c6 (green) contributions. From the figure, we can see that the second peak close to 1GeV comes from a \u03c6-like component that was not included in DarkCast. The dip that appears right after this peak is a consequence of the interference term between \u03c9 and \u03c6 contributions. Altogether, we can see that the inclusion of all the vector meson components provides a better description of the data points. For the case of theKK channel, in the left panel of figure 17 we show the individual normalized cross sections for the neutral K0K\u03040 (light green) and charged K+K\u2212(dark green) channels obtained using the fit from [3], along with the corresponding data points extracted from [48\u201357]. In solid (dashed) grey we show our (DarkCast) total KK contribution, where for our calculation KK = K0K\u03040 +K+K\u2212, while in DarkCast KK = 2 K+K\u2212. In the latter case, the reason for this definition is a consequence of the exclusive use of BaBar\n\u2013 27 \u2013\nH E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 9\n1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 s [GeV]\n10 4\n10 3\n10 2\n10 1\n100\n101\n102\nR KK\n= (e\n+ e\nKK )\n(e +\ne +\n)\n= KK = K + K = K0K0\ndata K + K data K0K0\n1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 s [GeV]\n10 4\n10 3\n10 2\n10 1\n100\n101\n102\nR K\n+ K\n= (e\n+ e\nK +\nK )\n(e +\ne +\n) = K + K\n-like -like -like\nFigure 17. Normalized cross-section RH\u00b5 for the H = KK channel. In the left panel the solid (dashed) gray line indicates our (DarkCast) total KK calculation, while the dark (light) green line indicated our fit for the K+K\u2212 (K0K\u03040) channel. The data points correspond to a compilation from several experiments [48\u201357]. In the right panel we show the decomposition of the charged K+K\u2212 channel (dark green) into \u03c1 (blue), \u03c9 (red) and \u03c6 (green) components.\ndata from [55], which was a study that considered only the charged channel contribution. Here, we update the KK channel description also by including recent data from several experiments.\nIn the right panel of figure 17, we present the decomposition of the charged K+K\u2212 channel (dark green) into \u03c1 (blue), \u03c9 (red) and \u03c6 (green) components. It is important to emphasize that in DarkCast only the \u03c6-like component, that is responsible for the peak near 1GeV, is considered. However, the other features of the fit mainly come from the remaining vector meson contributions included in this study.\nFinally, figure 18 shows the normalized cross section obtained using the fit from [3] for the individually KK\u03c0 channels, together with the decomposition into \u03c6 (green) and \u03c1 (blue) contributions and the data points extracted from [37, 58\u201361]. The sum of these three channels results in the total KK\u03c0 channel considered in this work, in contrast to the KK\u03c0 used by DarkCast, which consists only of the isoscalar component and agrees\n\u2013 28 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 9\nwith a different set of data [37]. Hence, we not only consider a new vector component to the KK\u03c0 channel, but also used more recent data and described it correctly including separately the three components K0K0\u03c00, K+K\u2212\u03c00 and K\u00b1K0\u03c0\u2213.\n(b) New channels. Besides the additional channels described in [3] that we include in this study, we add the description of four new channels, relevant in the higher energy region close to 2GeV. For the inclusion of these channels, first we need to identify all the possible intermediate structures. Then, if the data points are available, we can perform a fit using the python package IMinuit [15]. Below, we provide additional details concerning the method used for the computation of the fit for each of these new channels.\n\u2022 H = \u03c9\u03c0\u03c0\nIn case of the \u03c9\u03c0\u03c0 final state, we distinguish between the charged mode \u03c9\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 and the neutral mode \u03c9\u03c00\u03c00, dominantly leading to the five pion final state combinations 2(\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212)\u03c00 and \u03c0+\u03c0\u22123\u03c00, respectively. Although we have signs of possible intermediate substructures, such as \u03c9f0(980)\u2192 \u03c9\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 [35] and b1(1285)\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0\u03c0 [136], so far they have not been clearly seen in the data and hence, we will not consider them.\nConsidering that G-parity only allows for I = 0, we assume a point-like \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0\u03c0 interaction. The form factor is given by\nF\u03c9\u03c0\u03c0 = \u2211 V\naVm 2 V e i\u03d5V\nm2V \u2212 s\u2212 i \u221a s\u0393V , (B.1)\nwhere the only vector meson relevant to describe this channel is V = \u03c9\u2032\u2032, which corresponds to the \u03c9(1650) meson. For the fit, we use data from [35, 36, 67]. Table 4 lists the fit parameters obtained for this channel and figure 19 shows the curve of the fit with the hadronic data.\n\u2022 H = K\u2217(892)K\u03c0\nThe K\u2217(892)K\u03c0 channel is the dominant contribution to KK\u03c0\u03c0 final states. Here, we consider the four most relevant intermediate substructures: K\u22170K\u00b1\u03c0\u2213, K\u2217\u00b1KS\u03c0\u2213 andK\u2217\u00b1K\u2213\u03c00 decaying intoKSK\u00b1\u03c0\u2213\u03c00, andK\u22170K\u00b1\u03c0\u2213 decaying intoK+K\u2212\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212.\n\u2013 29 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 4 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 1 9\n1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 s [GeV]\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n[n b]\ne + e +\nfit data\n1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 s [GeV]\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n1.25\n1.50\n1.75\n[n b]\ne + e 0 0\nfit data\nFigure 19.

Due to the decay of the \u03c6 meson into two kaons, \u03c6(1020) \u2192 K+K\u2212, the charged (neutral) component represents a small contribution to the K+K\u2212\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 (K+K\u2212\u03c00\u03c00) state.\nIn the energy region relevant in this study, we can describe both \u03c6\u03c0\u03c0 states by the first two excited \u03c6 resonances \u03c6\u2032 and \u03c6\u2032\u2032.

Following [93, 137], we fitted the 6\u03c0 cross-section according to the parametrization given by\n\u03c36\u03c0 = 4\u03c0\u03b12 s3/2\n( aVm 2 V e i\u03d5V\ns\u2212m2V + i \u221a s\u0393V\n+Acont )2 , (B.4)\nwhere Acont = c0 + c1 e\u2212b/( \u221a s\u2212m0)\n( \u221a s\u2212m0)2\u2212a\n(B.5)\nis a Jacob-Slansky amplitude [138] that accounts for the mixture of several broad resonances, and the parameters c0, c1, a, b,m0 are free variables. Due to G-parity symmetry arguments we can identify V with the higher excitation of the \u03c1 vector meson, namely V = \u03c1\u2032\u2032\u2032. Table 7 shows the values of the free parameters obtained by our fit using the parameterization described above and the data from [93].

Possible candidates are a Majorana [139, 140], or Dirac fermion [141], a complex scalar particle [139\u2013143], or inelastic pseudo-Dirac DM [144, 145]. For all DM types, the DM mass m\u03c7 is set in relation to the mediator mass via R\u03c7 = m\u03c7/mZQ as it is common practice in the literature and the mediator-DM coupling strength can be specified as well. In case of inelastic DM, the mass splitting between the DM states has to be defined as well. As we focus on hadronic decays of vector particles, we refrain from including an invisible DM decay of vector mediators in the results presented above and leave this study for future work.\n(b) Width calculation. In order to calculate the decay widths of the ZQ mediator in the specified model, the width class is initiated by using the model as an input. As described in section 4, some channels H are sums of several final state configurations. For example H = 4\u03c0 consists of 2\u03c0+2\u03c0\u2212 and \u03c0+\u03c0\u22122\u03c00. Additionally to the summed contributions, the user can calculate single sub-contributions within the width class. Besides all contributions, the total width and lifetime of the particle is calculated without further ado.\n(c) Branching ratios. All calculated widths can then be used to calculate the branching ratios for all channels, as well as to determine the visible, invisible and hadronic width of the vector mediator.\n(d) R-ratio. In the style of the typical way of calculating the dark photon decay width as in eq. (3.5), the user can calculate the RH\u00b5 values for arbitrary vector mediator models. Multiplied by the decay width \u0393ZQ\u2192\u00b5+\u00b5\u2212 this yields the partial decay width \u0393ZQ\u2192H. This method is most useful for the dark photon, but can in principle also be used by other models. In this case the RH\u00b5 should be less seen as a ratio of \u03c3(e+e\u2212 \u2192 H)/\u03c3(e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212) but more simply as \u0393ZQ\u2192H/\u0393ZQ\u2192\u00b5+\u00b5\u2212 .\nOpen Access.
