Conclusions\nA concise synthetic route for pyrrole-based drug candidates from \u03b1-hydroxyketones, 3-oxobutanenitrile, and anilines is presented. The route was demonstrated by the synthesis of several drugs, with high overall yields. This route provides an easy strategy to quickly obtain pyrrole-based drug candidates and has wider applications to the synthesis of analogue compounds.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28031265/s1.
