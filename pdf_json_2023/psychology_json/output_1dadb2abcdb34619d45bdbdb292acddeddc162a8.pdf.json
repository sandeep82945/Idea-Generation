    "abstractText": "The potential application of borophene as a sensing material for gas-sensing devices is investigated in this work. We utilize density functional theory (DFT) to systematically study the adsorption mechanism and sensing performance of \u03c73-borophene to search for high-sensitivity sensors for minor pollutant gases. We compare the results to those for two Pmmn borophenes. The first-principles calculations are used to analyze the sensing performance of the three different borophenes (2 Pmmn borophene, 8 Pmmn borophene, and \u03c73-borophene) on five leading harmful gases (CO, NH3, SO2, H2S, and NO2). The adsorption configuration, adsorption energy, and electronic properties of \u03c73-borophene are investigated. Our results indicate that the mechanism of adsorption on \u03c73-borophene is chemisorption for NO2 and physisorption for SO2 and H2S. The mode of adsorption of CO and NH3 on \u03c73-borophene can be both physisorption and chemisorption, depending on the initially selected sites. Analyses of the charge transfer and density of states show that \u03c73-borophene is selective toward the adsorption of harmful gases and that N and O atoms form covalent bonds when chemisorbed on the surface of \u03c73-borophene. An interesting phenomenon is that when 8 Pmmn borophene adsorbs SO2, the gas molecules are dismembered and strongly adsorb on the surface of 8 Pmmn borophene, which provides a way of generating O2 while adsorbing harmful substances. Overall, the results of this work demonstrate the potential applications of borophene as a sensing material for harmful gas sensing or removal.",

Introduction\nThe extraction of fossil fuels, such as oil, gas, and coal, has contributed considerably to meet the increasing global energy demand. However, these fuels generate large quantities of harmful gases [1]. Industrial exhaust gases can be categorized into particulates, gas, and radioactive pollutants. These combustion products have caused numerous global problems, such as the greenhouse effect, the hole in the ozone layer, acid rain, and widespread environmental pollution [2,3]. Hence, it is vital to remove these harmful gases from the environment. Two-dimensional (2D) materials are considered to be nanomaterials with a sheet-like morphology featuring a large lateral size ranging from hundreds of nanometers to tens of micrometers or, even more significantly, a thickness of a single or a few atomic layers [4,5]. Two-dimensional materials with unusual properties are some of the most promising candidates for numerous applications, including electronics, optoelectronics, catalysis, energy storage, solar cells, biomedicine, sensors, environments, etc. [6]. Due to the larger available surface volume ratio of 2D materials, the adsorption of gas molecules can arouse significant signals in the sensor\u2019s materials, leading to higher sensing performance [7,8]. In 2004, the discovery of graphene ushered in a new era in the study of 2D materials [9]. The large surface area and high conductivity of graphene have resulted in extensive applications [10], such as electrode materials, molecular and other types of sensors, hydrogen storage materials, and data storage [11]. Graphene is the material used\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 2117. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano13142117 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 2117 2 of 16\nmost extensively from nanoelectronics to aerospace applications [12,13]. Borophene is structurally analogous to graphene and was first theoretically predicted by Tang et al. in 2007 [14]. Mannix et al. subsequently prepared borophene in the form of thin sheets on an Ag(111) substrate [15]. Bonding between boron atoms is more complex than between carbon atoms [15]; 16 allotropic compounds based on B12 have been discovered that can be synthesized by various methods. Compared to carbon, boron has a lower molecular weight and is more substantial, flexible, lighter, and more prone to chemical reactions. Thus, boron has tremendous potential as a sensor material. Previous density functional theory (DFT) calculations have demonstrated that single-atomic-layer boron sheets consisting of triangular and hexagonal motifs are locally stable, where the most stable structure is known as an \u03b1 sheet [14]. Subsequent calculations led to the prediction of two novel 2D boron phases with nonzero thickness and higher durability than the \u03b1 sheet [16]. The first of these phases is 8 Pmmn borophene (referred to as a \u03b2 sheet), which has an electronic band structure with a distinct Dirac cone. This phase has a curved structure with eight atoms in the unit cell and is considerably more complex than other 2D materials, such as graphene and phosphorene [10,17]. The second phase is 2 Pmmn borophene (referred to as a \u03b3 sheet). Free-standing relaxation of this structure eliminates the slight corrugation along the A direction and preserves buckling along the B direction [15]. Calculations of the phonon spectra of the \u03b2 and \u03b3 phases have been found to consist of only accurate frequencies; that is, both structures are mechanically stable [18,19]. Liquid-phase exfoliation has been used to synthesize \u03b212-and \u03c73-borophenes with graphene-like hexagonal vacancies that exist stably and freely [20\u201322]. Systematically, Zhang et al. investigated the 2D boron sheet using cluster expansion, consisting of hexagonal holes and triangular shapes on group 11 elements used for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth [23]. In recent years, three types of boron nanosheets, i.e., \u03b46-borophene, \u03b212-borophene, and \u03c73-borophene, have been successfully synthesized in experiments by choosing growth substrates of the noble metals Ag or Au. Because \u03c73-borophene has been synthesized in experiments, we chose it as the main research candidate. The other point is that the sensing performance of \u03c73-borophene on harmful gas small molecules is currently unclear. Considering that the structure of \u03c73-borophene is not complex compared to other borophene structures, we predict that it can have unique transmission characteristics and sensing performance. In this work, we select the other two slightly complex borophenes (2 Pmmn and 8 Pmmn) for comparison. A series of studies have been carried out on the adsorption of harmful gases. For example, Leenaerts et al. used first-principles calculations to study the adsorption of H2O, NH3, CO, and NO on graphene. All the gases were physisorbed on graphene, and only weak charge transfer occurred between the small gas molecules and graphene [24,25]. The adsorption of small gas molecules on other 2D materials has also been extensively studied, including phosphorene [26,27], and germanene [28]. Many research groups have reported the adsorption behavior of gases on borophene, including SO2 [29], AC [30], HCN [31], H2S [32], HCOH [33], AD [34], DMA/TMA [35], and N2-containing gases (such as NO, NO2, NH3) [36,37]. Valadbeigi et al. reviewed DFT studies on the adsorption of CO, N2, NO, and other molecules on the boron cluster B36 [38]. DFT predictions have shown that the boron cluster B36 is a promising adsorbent for CO and NO molecules. Liu et al. used a first-principles study to explore adsorption by borophene of gas molecules (CO, CO2, NH3, NO, NO2, and CH4) [39]. Thus, borophene has broad prospects for the adsorption of harmful gases. Nevertheless, the results of research studies to date are insufficient to understand the adsorption of toxic gases on borophene. Given the current understanding of borophene adsorption summarized above, firstprinciples calculations are performed in this study to investigate the characteristics of \u03c73-borophene adsorption of harmful gases, and the results are compared to those of the two Pmmn borophenes. We investigate the adsorption of five toxic industrial gases (CO, NH3, SO2, H2S, and NO2) by the three borophenes (2 Pmmn borophene, 8 Pmmn borophene, and \u03c73-borophene). The borophenes\u2019 geometric structure and binding energy are calculated\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 2117 3 of 16\nto determine the stable forms of the borophenes during the gas adsorption process. The calculation results show that adsorption on \u03c73-borophene is more effective and stable than on the Pmmn borophenes. Therefore, we further study \u03c73-borophene and find that physisorption and chemisorption of CO and NH3 occur at different sites on \u03c73-borophene. The adsorption of SO2 and H2S on \u03c73-borophene is physical. Adsorption of NO2 on \u03c73borophene is chemical, indicating that \u03c73-borophene has a good detection ability for NO2. Chemisorption deforms a \u03c73-borophene monolayer, enhancing the interaction between the adsorbed molecules and the adsorbent surface. The phonon spectra, charge transfer, total density of states (TDOS), and partial density of states (PDOS) are calculated to analyze the interaction between the adsorbed gas and original borophene. The results of this study provide theoretical guidance for the practical application of \u03c73-borophene as an adsorbent and sensor for pollutant gases.\n2. Computational Methods\nAll calculations are performed based on the first-principles calculations using the projector-augmented wave method implemented in the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [40]. Within the implemented DFT framework, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is used to correct the exchange-correlation functional between electrons, and the Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE) function is used to describe the exchange and correlation energy [41,42]. Van der Waals forces are included by applying a dispersioncorrected framework (DFT-D3) [43]. The electron wave function is spread out as a plane wave with an energy cutoff of 400 eV to ensure convergence. To ensure the credibility of the calculation results, we model the \u03c73-borophene prototype and the borophene after cell expansion, using periodic boundary conditions in three-dimensional space and the 20\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 16\nFigure 2.

Analysis of the Overall Trend of Gas Adsorption for Five Gases\nThe bond lengths of CO, NH3, NO2, SO2, and H2S are known to be 1.13 \u00c5, 1.01 \u00c5, 1.20 \u00c5, 1.448 \u00c5, and 1.543 \u00c5, respectively. A monolayer of \u03c73-borophene was established onto which different harmful gases were adsorbed. The distance from the bottom borophene was set to 2 \u00c5 to control the variable. We selected five adsorption sites: B1, B2, D1, D2, and H. The five investigated gases are simple compounds composed of two elements. Therefore, each position selected two adsorption methods. The configuration in which the atom corresponding to the first element in the molecular gas formula of the gas was closer to \u03c73-borophene than the other atom was represented by \u22121. The configuration in which the atom corresponding to the second element in the molecular formula of the gas was closer to \u03c73-borophene than the other atom was represented by \u22122. Therefore, a total of ten adsorption configurations were investigated. Table 2 shows the adsorption energy, number of transfer electrons, and distance to the bottom borophene for the harmful gases adsorbed at different sites on \u03c73borophene. An appropriate sensor requires both sensitivity and selectivity. When the structure of the adsorbed gas has sufficient charge transfer and appropriate adsorption energy, it proves that \u03c73-borophene can be used as an application sensor for detecting harmful g ses. Table 2 shows that th vertical adsorptio of the CO molecules on the B (B1 a d B2) and D (D1 and D2) sites shifted the \u03c73-borophene layer up. The B-B bon length changed from 1.71 \u00c5 to 1.79 \u00c5, forming a C-B bond. These esults mea an enormous interaction force exists bet een \u03c73-bo ophene and the C at m. Wh n he O atom was closer to \u03c73b rophene, it always deflected th structure at this time. The dist nce between the CO m lecule and the bottom borophene incr ased to approximately 3.3 \u00c5, and the corresponding adsorption energy was approximately \u22120.1 eV. When the CO molecule was ads rbed on \u03c73-borophene with the C atom closer to the \u03c73-borophene s ructure than the O atom, the distance between the CO a the bottom borophene decreased to ap roximately 1.5 \u00c5, resulting in the higher adsorption efficiency (\u22120.44~\u22120.685 eV). The adsorption of CO vertically on the H site did not lead to considerable rotation of the gas molecule. However, the distance between the gas molecules and the bottom borophene increased to approximately 3.1 \u00c5, and the adsorption energy was relatively low. The highest adsorption energy (\u22120.685 eV) was obtained for adsorption on B2 with the C atom closer to \u03c73-borophene than the O atom, which was, therefore, the most stable configuration for the CO adsorption on the \u03c73-borophene layer. At the B1, B2, D1, and D2 sites, when the N atom was closer to \u03c73-borophene (\u22120.538~\u22120.764 eV), the adsorption effect was remarkable, and the height was closer to \u03c73borophene (about 1.64 \u00c5). During chemisorption, the B atom moved upward, and the B\u2013 B bond increased in length (from 1.71 \u00c5 to 1.79 \u00c5). However, when NH3 adsorbed on \u03c73borophene at the H site, the height of the gas molecule above the \u03c73-borophene surface was slightly different, and the adsorption energy was approximately \u22120.134 eV. The adsorption on the D1 and D2 sites was more unstable than adsorption on the B1 and B2 sites, during which the gas molecules rotated slightly and shifted. The adsorption process of the NH3 was consistent with the adsorption process of the CO. The highest adsorption energy for NH3 (\u22120.764 eV) was obtained for the B2 site. When \u03c73-borophene adsorbed the NO2, the adsorption on all sites was chemisorption. As the N atom in the initial NO2 configuration was closer to the \u03c73-borophene than the O atom, the final optimized structures for adsorption at the H, B2, D1, and D2 sites consisted of N-O bonds parallel to the D2, N-B bonds, and O-B bonds.

Analysis of the Overall Trend of Gas Adsorption for Five Gases\nThe bond lengths of CO, NH3, NO2, SO2, and H2S are known to be 1.13 \u00c5, 1.01 \u00c5, 1.20 \u00c5, 1.448 \u00c5, and 1.543 \u00c5, respectively. A monolaye of \u03c73 borophene was established onto which different harmful gases were adsorbed. T e distance from the bottom borophene was set to 2 \u00c5 to control the v riable. We selected five adsorption sites: B1, B2, D1, D2, and H. The five investigated gases are simple compounds comp sed of two elements. Therefore, each position selected two adsorption m thods. The configuration in which the atom corresponding to the first element in the mo ecular ga formula of the gas was closer to \u03c73-borophene than the other atom was represent d by \u22121. The configuration in which the atom corresponding to the second element in the molecular formula of the gas was closer to \u03c73-borophene than the oth r tom was represented by \u22122. Theref e, a total of ten adsorption configurations were investigated. Tabl 2 shows the adsorption e ergy, number of transfer electrons, and distance t the bottom borophe e for the armful gases adsorbed at different sites on \u03c73borophene. An appr priate s nsor requires bot sensitivity and selectivity. When the s ructure of t adsorbed gas h s sufficient charge tra sfer and appropriate adsorption energy, it proves that \u03c73-borophene can b used as application sensor for detecting harmf l gas s. Table 2 hows that the vertical adsorption of the CO molecules on the B (B1 and B2) and D (D1 nd D2) sites shifted the \u03c73-borophene l yer up. The B-B bond length changed from 1.71 \u00c5 to 1.79 \u00c5, forming a C-B bond. These results mean an enormous interaction f rce exists between \u03c73-borophen an the C ato . W en the O atom was closer to \u03c73b ophen , it always deflected th structure at this time. The distance between the CO molecule a d the ottom incre sed to approximately 3.3 \u00c5, and the corresponding adsorpt on energy was appr x mately \u22120.1 eV. When the CO molecule was adsorbed on \u03c73-borophen with the C atom closer to the \u03c73-borophene structure than the O at m, the dista ce b tween the CO and the bott m borophene decreased to approximately 1.5 \u00c5, resulting in the higher adsorption efficiency (\u22120.44~\u22120.685 eV). The adsorption of CO vertically on the H site did not lead to considerable rotation of the gas molecule. However, the distance between the gas molecules and the bottom borophene increased to approximately 3.1 \u00c5, and the adsorption energy was relatively low. The highest adsorption energy (\u22120.685 eV) was obtained for adsorption on B2 with the C atom closer to \u03c73-borophene than the O atom, which was, therefore, the most stable configuration for the CO adsorp ion on the \u03c73-borophene layer. At th B1, B2, D1, and D2 sites, when the N atom was closer to \u03c73-borophene (\u22120.538~\u22120.764 eV), the effect was remarkable, and the height was closer to \u03c73borophene (about 1.64 \u00c5). During chemisorption, the B atom moved upward, and the B\u2013 B bond increased in lengt (from 1.71 \u00c5 to 1.79 \u00c5). However, when NH3 adsorbed on \u03c73borophene a the H site, the height of the gas molecule above the \u03c73-borophene surface was slightly different, and the adsorption energy was approximately \u22120.134 eV. The adsorption on the D1 and D2 si es was m re u stable than adsorption on the B1 and B2 sites, during which the gas molecules rotated slightly and shifted. The adsorption process of the NH3 was consistent with the adsorption process of the CO. The highest adsorption energy for NH3 (\u22120.764 eV) was obtained for the B2 site. Wh n \u03c73-borophene adsorbed the NO2, the adsorption on all sites was chemisorption. As the N atom in the initial NO2 configuration was closer to the \u03c73-borophene than the O atom, the final optimized structures for adsorption at the H, B2, D1, and D2 sites consisted of N-O bonds parallel to the D2, N-B bonds, and O-B bonds.

To evaluate the stabi ity of ad orption a d bonding, we calculat the adsor tion energy (Ead) using the follow n qu tion: Ead = EX+Borophene \u2212 EBorophene \u2212 EX. (1) EX+Borophene, EBorophene, and EX are the total energy of borophene with the adsorbed gas molecule, the original borophene, and the isolated gas molecules, respectively. In addition, we calculate the charge transferred from borophene to a gas molecule using the Bader charge analysis code [45]. The transferred charge reflects the change in the electron density between a gas molecule and the borophene surface during the interaction, which is calculated using the following equation: \u2206\u03c1 = \u03c1X+Borophene \u2212 \u03c1Borophene \u2212 \u03c1X, (2) where \u03c1X+Borophene, \u03c1Borophene, and \u03c1X represent the total charge density of boro hene with the adsorbed as molecule, the original borophen , and an isolated gas molecule, r spect vely. 3.

During che isorption, the B atom moved upward, and the B\u2013 B bond increased in length (from 1.71 \u00c5 to 1.79 \u00c5). However, when NH3 adsorbed on \u03c73borop en a he H si e, the h ight f th g s molecule a ve the \u03c73-borophene surface was slightly ifferent, and the adsor ti n ene gy w s approxim tely \u22120.134 eV.

From the electronic band structure and TDOS, one can find the typical metallic behavior and apparent anisotropy for \u03c73-borophene. At the Fermi level, \u03c73-borophene has a density of state (DOS) of 2.417 per eV. In the X-S and Y-G directions, multiple electron energy bands pass through the Fermi level, where the main contributions are from the py and pz orbitals of the B atom. However, in the S-Y direction, the electron bands near the Fermi level are relatively flat, and the electronic states are more localized, indicating that the electronic properties vary with the directions. Figure 2b shows the phonon spectrum along several highly symmetric paths, where no imaginary frequency arises in the BZ. Hence, the \u03c73borophene structure is stable. The optical phonon branch has a high eigenvalue of 38.89 THz, whereas the eigenvalue of graphene is 47.98 THz [48], showing that \u03c73-borophene is dynamically stable.

A monolayer of \u03c73-borophene was established onto which different harmful gases were adsorbed. The distance from the bottom borophene was set to 2 \u00c5 to control the variable. We selected five adsorption sites: B1, B2, D1, D2, and H. The five investigated gases are simple compounds composed of two elements. Therefore, each position selected two adsorption methods. The configuration in which the atom corresponding to the first element in the molecular gas formula of the gas was closer to \u03c73-borophene than the other atom was represented by \u22121. The configuration in which the atom corresponding to the second element in the molecular formula of the gas was closer to \u03c73-borophene than the other atom was represented by \u22122.

The B-B bond length changed from 1.71 \u00c5 to 1.79 \u00c5, forming a C-B bond. These results mean an enormous interaction force exists between \u03c73-borophene and the C atom. When the O atom was closer to \u03c73borophene, it always deflected the structure at this time. The distance between the CO molecule and the bottom borophene increased to approximately 3.3 \u00c5, and the corresponding adsorption energy was approximately \u22120.1 eV. When the CO molecule was adsorbed on \u03c73-borophene with the C atom closer to the \u03c73-borophene structure than the O atom, the distance between the CO and the bottom borophene decreased to approximately 1.5 \u00c5, resulting in the higher adsorption efficiency (\u22120.44~\u22120.685 eV). The adsorption of CO vertically on the H site did not lead to considerable rotation of the gas molecule. However, the distance between the gas molecules and the bottom borophene increased to approximately 3.1 \u00c5, and the adsorption energy was relatively low. The highest adsorption energy (\u22120.685 eV) was obtained for adsorption on B2 with the C atom closer to \u03c73-borophene than the O atom, which was, therefore, the most stable configuration for the CO adsorption on the \u03c73-borophene layer.

During chemisorption, the B atom moved upward, and the B\u2013 B bond increased in length (from 1.71 \u00c5 to 1.79 \u00c5).

The adsorption on the D1 and D2 sites was more unstable than adsorption on the B1 and B2 sites, during which the gas molecules rotated slightly and shifted. The adsorption process of the NH3 was consistent with the adsorption process of the CO. The highest adsorption energy for NH3 (\u22120.764 eV) was obtained for the B2 site.

The istance between the CO\nolecule a d the bottom borophene inc eased to approximat ly 3.3 \u00c5, and the corresponding dsorption nergy was approximately \u22120.1 eV. When the CO molecule was adsorbed on \u03c73-borophene wi the C atom close to th \u03c73-bor phe structure t an the O atom, the distance between the CO and the bottom borophene dec ased to approximat ly 1.5 \u00c5, resulting in the high r adsorption efficiency (\u22120 44~\u22120.685 eV). The adsorption of CO vertica ly on the H site did n le d t considerab rotation of the gas molecule.

During che isorption, the B atom moved upward, and the B\u2013 B bo d increased in length (fr m 1.71 \u00c5 to 1.79 \u00c5).

However, th distance between the g s molecules and the b ttom borophene increased o appr ximately 3.1 \u00c5, and the adsorption energy was rel ively low. The hig st adsorption energy (\u22120.685 eV) was obtained for adso ption on B2 with the C atom closer to \u03c73-borophene than the O atom, which was, therefore, the most sta le configu ation for the CO adsorpti n on the \u03c73-b roph ne l yer.

The adsorp i on the D1 and D2 si es was mor unstable t an ads rption on the B1 and B2 sites, during which the gas molecules ro ated slightly and shifted. The adsorption process of\nthe NH3 was consistent with the ads rption process of the CO. The highest adsorpti n\nenergy for NH3 (\u22120.764 eV) was obtained for the B2 site.\nWhen \u03c73-borophene adsorbed the NO , adsorption on all ites was chemi orpti .

A monolayer of \u03c73-bor phene was established onto which diff rent harmful gases were adsorbed. The di tance from the bottom borophene was set to 2 \u00c5 to control the variable. We s lected five ads rption sites: B1, B2, D1, D2, nd H. The five investigated gases are simple compounds composed of two el men s. Therefore, each position selected two adsorption methods.

Table 2 shows that the vertical adsorption of the CO molecules on the B (B1 and B2) and D (D1 and D2) sit s shifted the \u03c73-borophene layer up.

T ble 2 shows that the vertical adsorption of the CO molecules on the B (B1 and B2) and D (D1 and D2) sites shift d the \u03c73-borophene layer up. The B-B bond length changed fr m 1.71 \u00c5 to 1.79 \u00c5, forming a C-B bond. These results mean an enormous interaction force exists between \u03c73-b roph ne and the C atom. When the O atom was closer to \u03c73borophen , it alway defl cted the structure at this time. The distance between the CO\nolecul and the bottom borophene increased to approximately 3.3 \u00c5, and the corresp nding adsorption energy was appr ximately \u22120.1 eV. When the CO molecule was ads r ed n \u03c73-b phene wit the C atom closer to the \u03c73-borophene structure than the O atom, the ist ce b tw e the CO and th bottom borophene decreased to approximately 1 5 \u00c5, resulting in the higher s r ti efficiency (\u22120.44~\u22120.685 eV). The adsorption of CO vertically on the H site did not ead to considerable rotation of the gas molecule. Howev r, the distan e b tw en the gas molecules and the bottom borophene increased to appr ximat ly 3.1 \u00c5, and the adsorption energy was relatively low. The highest adsorption energy (\u22120.685 eV) was obtained f r adsorption on B2 with the C atom closer to \u03c73-borophene than t O atom, i h was, therefore, the most stable configuration for the CO ads rption o the \u03c73-borophene laye . At th B1, B2, D1, and D2 sites, when the N atom was closer to \u03c73-borophene (\u22120.538~\u22120.764 eV), the adsorption effe t was emarkable, and the height was closer to \u03c73b rophene (about 1.64 \u00c5). During chemisorption, the B atom moved upward, and the B\u2013 B bo d increased in length (from 1.7 \u00c5 to 1.79 \u00c5). However, when NH3 adsorbed on \u03c73bor p ene at the H site, the height f the ga molecule above the \u03c73-borophene surface wa slightly iffer nt, and t adsorp ion energy was approximately \u22120.134 eV. The adsorption on the D1 and D2 sites was more unstable than adsorption on the B1 and B2 sites,\nuring which the gas molecule rotated lightly and shifted. The adsorption process of the NH3 was c nsistent with e adsorption process of the CO. The highest adsorption e ergy for NH3 (\u22120.764 eV) was obtain f r the B2 site. Whe \u03c73 bor phene adsorbed t e NO2, t e a sorption on all sites was chemisorption. As he N atom in the initial NO2 configura ion was closer to the \u03c73-borophene than the O\nom, the final optimized structures for adsorpti at the H, B2, D1, and D2 sites consisted of N-O bonds parallel to the D2, N-B bonds, and O-B bonds.

By comparison, NH3 and H2S are more likely to adsorb above H, whereas NO2 and SO2 are more likely to adsorb above D2. Different gases are likely to lose electrons at different positions because of the difference in the gas molecular structures and interactions between each atom in the gas and the B atom.

The density of states at the Fermi level is zero. In the band structure, there is a Dirac cone, and the valence band and conduction band meet at the junction point (0, 0.3, 0) at the Fermi level. We investigated five adsorption sites on 2 Pmmn and 8 Pmmn borophene: B1, B2, D1, and D2. The same nomenclature was used for \u03c73-borophene; that is, the configuration in which the atom corresponding to the first (second) element in the molecular formula of the gas was closer to borophene than the other atom in the gas molecule was represented by \u22121 (\u22122).

Eight adsorption mechanisms were considered for each type of borophene. The adsorption energy and charge transfer number of 2 Pmmn and 8 Pmmn borophene for the absorption of harmful gases at different sites are shown in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. The results in the two tables presented above clearly demonstrate that these two borophenes can adsorb harmful gases, and the adsorption site determined the magnitude of the adsorption energy. Also, the physisorption results from relatively weak interactions between a gas molecule and the absorbent surface. Physisorption is nonspecific and involves relatively weak van der Waals forces and low adsorption energies. In addition, physically adsorbed molecules can diffuse along the surface of an adsorbent and are usually not bound to specific locations on the surface. Because the gas molecules are only weakly bound to the adsorbent surface, physisorption can be rapidly reversed. The chemical bond can be created by the sharing of electrons between the adsorbate and the adsorbent and can be regarded as the formation of a surface compound. Chemisorption is difficult to reverse,\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 2117 12 of 16\nbecause of the strong adhesion between the adsorbate and adsorbent [51]. However, as chemisorbed gas molecules cannot be easily desorbed into the gas phase, boron cannot be reused after the gas has been adsorbed onto borophene. Raw materials are thus wasted. Figure 9 shows the results of the differential charge density analysis of the two Pmmn borophenes for the adsorption of (from left to right) CO, NH3, NO2, SO2, and H2S.\nIn Figure 9, the sizable blue area below the gas molecule after adsorption by 2 Pmmn borophene indicates that borophene lost electrons. The small gas molecule was surrounded by yellow regions, indicating that the gas received electrons. The quantity of charge transferred can be used to preliminarily determine the type of adsorption involved. After a gas molecule was adsorbed on the 8 Pmmn borophene, a \u201c#\u201d-shaped blue area appeared high above the borophene surface. By contrast, a \u201c#\u201d-shaped yellow area appeared below the B atom at the bottom of borophene. An intriguing result is that the absolute value of the adsorption energy of the 8 Pmmn borophene for SO2 was considerably higher than those of the other two borophenes, indicating chemisorption. The optimized result after adsorption was S\u2013O bond breakage, meaning that 8 Pmmn borophene may be able to dismember toxic gas molecules. It is speculated that this behavior results from the migration of half of the electrons in 8 Pmmn borophene from the interior to the bridge B atom, transforming 8 Pmmn borophene into a covalent single-element 2D material with ionic properties. Compared to planar borophene, 8 Pmmn borophene is more stable and therefore less prone to deformation. This property may enable 8 Pmmn borophene to dismember and thereby adsorb SO2 more effectively than planar borophene. The fracture of the chemical bond can occur via a free radical reaction, which can be realized by ionization or electron transfer. The cleavage of SO2 molecular bonds could occur via charge transfer, resulting in a more robust and stable O\u2013B bond for 8 Pmmn borophene than for planar borophene.\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 2117 13 of 16\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 16\nable to dismember toxic gas molecules.

This result suggests that borophene with metallic properties has better adsorption performance than borophene with semiconductor properties. The site most prone to electron loss was the H for the \u03c73-borophene and the B1 for the 2 Pmmn and 8 Pmmn borophene. The adsorption mechanism determines the adsorption energy for small gas molecules. Vertical adsorption was most efficient for CO because the C atoms were located closer to the borophene surface than the O atoms. The most efficient NH3 adsorption occurred when the N atoms were closer to the borophene surface than the H atoms. The most efficient NO2 adsorption occurred when the O atoms were closer to the borophene surface than the N atoms. The most efficient SO2 adsorption occurred when the O atoms were closer to the borophene surface than the S atoms for 2 Pmmn and 8 Pmmn borophene) but when the S atoms were closer to the borophene surface than the O atoms for \u03c73-borophene. The adsorption of H2S was most efficient when the H atoms were closer to the borophene surface than the S atoms for the \u03c73- and 8-Pmmn borophene but when the S atoms were closer to the borophene surface than the H atoms for 2 Pmmn borophene.\nAs shown in Figure 10, if the adsorption energy is too high, it will cause small molecules of gas and borophene to tightly adsorb in the form of chemical adsorption, leading to the waste of raw materials and turning borophene into a disposable sensor device. If the adsorption energy is too low, it will lead to very unstable adsorption, and once there is a slight change in the external environment, it will lead to the desorption of gas on the adsorption. In addition, especially when 8 Pmmn borophene adsorbs gas, the difference in the adsorption energy at each site is too large, so it can be inferred that its adsorption of harmful gases is very unstable. Thus, compared to the other two Pmmn borophenes,\nAfter a comparative analysis of the three types of borophene, it was found that the adsorption capacity decreased in the order of 2 Pmmn borophene > \u03c73-borophene > 8 Pmmn borophene.

Comparison diagram of the three systems adsorbing harmful gases.\n4. Summary In summary, we performed a first-principles calculation to investigate the adsorption potentials and effects of harmful gas molecules (CO, NH3, NO2, SO2, and H2S) on three types of borophenes and then determined the most efficient adsorption site and mechanism. Our used lattice constant of \u03c73-borophene was almost consistent with the previous experimental report, which ensured the correctness of our structure and provided a good basis for the following experiments. Compared to the two Pmmn borophenes, \u03c73-borophene was found to have a better ability to adsorb harmful gases and can be used without excessive waste of raw materials. The adsorption capacity of \u03c73-borophene was different for the five gases and was strongest for NO2 because a covalent bond formed between the NO2 and \u03c73-borophene. The high energy and large charge transfer of \u03c73-borophene for gas adsorption makes \u03c73-borophene a candidate material for gas sensor applications. However, chemisorption results in the waste of raw materials, because \u03c73-borophene cannot be reused and becomes a disposable sensor device. The adsorption mechanism for H2S and SO2 on \u03c73-borophene was pure physisorption, which requires low adsorption energy but a high transfer charge. This result indicates that \u03c73-borophene\u2013adsorbed gas structures are relatively stable after adsorption. Therefore, \u03c73-borophene is a good adsorbent. As CO and NH3 can be both physisorbed and chemisorbed on \u03c73-borophene, \u03c73-borophene has high selectivity and is, therefore, a good choice for adsorbing these gases. In addition, it has been found that the adsorption of SO2 by 8 Pmmn borophene occurs by the decomposition of the gas molecules followed by the strong adsorption of the atoms on the surface of 8 Pmmn borophene, which could be exploited to generate O2 during the adsorption of\n4.
