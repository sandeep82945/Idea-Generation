"Future research will likely be needed to improve the accuracy of the results and gain a more comprehensive understanding of user needs and experiences." 

"Furthermore, increasing the number of participants in future studies may yield more robust results and enhance the generalizability of our findings."

"Because the results obtained in this study were intervention dependent, there is still a need to obtain data that is independent of the interventions. One way to accomplish this is to conduct multiple studies, each using a different intervention available on eSano, and then combine the results of these studies to obtain more comprehensive, context-independent findings."

"It may also prove interesting to spend more time understanding how users perceive different areas on the screen with different background colors, and perhaps even more detailed information about how users interact with AOIs of different background colors."

"However, conducting another study over a longer period of time could provide further insight into how users interact with the application. With this better understanding, designers could improve the persuasiveness of the app and create more lasting user engagement."
