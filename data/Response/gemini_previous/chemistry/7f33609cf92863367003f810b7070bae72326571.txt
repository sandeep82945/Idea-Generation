1. **Investigate the potential health benefits of lutein and its isomers.** Lutein is known to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and it has been shown to protect against age-related macular degeneration and other eye diseases. However, less is known about the health benefits of lutein's isomers. Future research could investigate the effects of these isomers on various aspects of health, such as cardiovascular health, cognitive function, and cancer risk.


2. **Explore the use of lutein and its isomers as natural food colorants.** Lutein and its isomers are natural pigments that can be used to color food products. They are safe for consumption and have a wide range of colors, from yellow to orange to red. Future research could investigate the use of these pigments in various food applications, such as beverages, baked goods, and dairy products.


3. **Develop new methods for the extraction and purification of lutein and its isomers.** Lutein and its isomers are typically extracted from plants using organic solvents. However, these methods can be time-consuming and expensive. Future research could focus on developing new methods for the extraction and purification of these compounds that are more efficient and cost-effective.


4. **Investigate the role of lutein and its isomers in plant physiology.** Lutein and its isomers are important components of the photosynthetic apparatus in plants. They play a role in light harvesting and energy transfer. Future research could investigate the role of these compounds in other aspects of plant physiology, such as growth, development, and reproduction.


5. **Study the effects of environmental factors on the production of lutein and its isomers in plants.** The production of lutein and its isomers in plants can be affected by a variety of environmental factors, such as light intensity, temperature, and water availability. Future research could investigate the effects of these factors on the production of these compounds in different plant species. This information could be used to optimize the production of lutein and its isomers in crops and other plants.
