"The definite answers will be given in three to five years when the new conditions will be clear and a number of studies will have been published."

"Even though it is too early to fully understand the definite food choice motive changes, defining a “new” index of consumer satisfaction is necessary since it can alter the food sale strategies of retail managers, food companies, and the other parties involved in the agri-food chain."

"Finally, could the pandemic be assumed to be the threshold at which the usual rules behind food choices are suspended? The definite answer will be known in three to five years when the new worldwide economic and social condition will be clear and stable, and an adequate number of studies will be published by then."

"In this review, we present the studies that have reported to date, with the above conclusions derived from their results so far. It would be more workable if consumers are encouraged to explore healthier food options, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole foods."

"The present review, which is based on the findings reported so far, offers 10 specific propositions for each one of the 10 main food choice motives examined, which can be used as a practical and theoretical basis for the development of a “new” FCM index that can be used by retail managers, food companies, and any other parties involved in the agri-food chain."
