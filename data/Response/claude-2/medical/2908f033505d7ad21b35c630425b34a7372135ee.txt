 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the prehabilitation multimodal online program in improving postoperative outcomes like complications, length of stay, and quality of life. This would provide high-quality evidence on the effectiveness of the program.

2. Explore strategies to improve patient motivation and encouragement for participating in the online prehabilitation program, such as inclusion of motivational coaching, reminders, feedback, etc. This could help address the barriers identified in the current study. 

3. Investigate the impact of prehabilitation in high-risk groups like patients with multiple comorbidities. These patients may derive greater benefits from prehabilitation.

4. Evaluate the cost-effectiveness and healthcare resource utilization of the online prehabilitation program compared to standard care. This is important for wider adoption of the program.

5. Study the long-term impacts of the prehabilitation program by following up patients for 6-12 months post-surgery. This can provide insights into sustained benefits on outcomes like quality of life.
