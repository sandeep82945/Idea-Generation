If commercial (often crossbred) animals could be used in the reference population for these genomic evaluations, this could allow for very large reference populations. In tropical beef systems, such animals often have no pedigree information. Here we investigate potential models for such data, using marker heterozygosity (to model heterosis) and breed composition derived from genetic markers, as covariates in the model. Models treated breed effects as either fixed or random, and included genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) and BayesR. A tropically-adapted beef cattle dataset of 29,391 purebred, crossbred and composite commercial animals was used to evaluate the models. Results Treating breed effects as random, in an approach analogous to genetic groups allowed partitioning of the genetic variance into within-breed and across breed-components (even with a large number of breeds), and estimation of within-breed and across-breed genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV). We demonstrate that moderately-accurate (0.30\u20130.43) GEBV can be calculated using these models. Treating breed effects as random gave more accurate GEBV than treating breed as fixed. A simple GBLUP model where no breed effects were fitted gave the same accuracy (and correlations of GEBV very close to 1) as a model where GEBV for within-breed and the GEBV for (random) across-breed effects were included. When GEBV were predicted for herds with no data in the reference population, BayesR resulted in the highest accuracy, with 3% accuracy improvement averaged across traits, especially when the validation population was less related to the reference population. Estimates of heterosis from our models were in line with previous estimates from beef cattle. A method for estimating the number of effective breed comparisons for each breed combination accumulated across contemporary groups is presented. Conclusions When no pedigree is available, breed composition and heterosis for inclusion in multi-breed genomic evaluation can be estimated from genotypes. When GEBV were predicted for herds with no data in the reference population, BayesR resulted in the highest accuracy. Background Genomic selection has accelerated genetic gains in a number of livestock populations, particularly those based on a small number of breeds and in cases where large existing reference populations were available [1, 2]. The prime example of genomic selection is in Holstein and Jersey dairy cattle, for which semen samples from many progeny-tested bulls formed the basis of reference *Correspondence: Ben J.

Genetics Selection Evolution (2023) 55:71 populations [3]. In other livestock populations, the implementation of genomic selection has proved more challenging, both because they consist of many different breeds and crossbreds, and because such ready-made historical reference populations that are available in dairy populations do not exist [4, 5]. Multi-breed genomic evaluations for livestock are desirable as they allow producers to select sires and dams across breeds, crossbreds and composites, which increase selection intensity. The advantage of multi-breed evaluations for increasing accuracy of genomic prediction, particularly for breeds with smaller reference set sizes, has been demonstrated in dairy cattle [6], sheep [4, 7] and beef cattle [8]. Several approaches for multi-breed genomic predictions have been proposed (see Misztal et al. [9] for a comprehensive review). de Roos et al. [10] made an assumption that the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) would be shared across breeds if they were sufficiently dense. For this to occur, the causative mutations that affect a trait would have to be the same across breeds, and for multibreed predictions, SNPs would have to be close enough to the mutation so that the linkage disequilibrium phase between SNPs and the causative mutation persists across breeds. As a proxy for SNP\u2013causative mutation linkage disequilibrium phase, they investigated the extent of SNP\u2013SNP linkage disequilibrium across three Bos taurus breeds. They concluded that 300,000 equally-spaced SNPs would be sufficient for multi-breed genomic predictions. Goddard and Hayes [11] extended this analysis to more breeds. They also concluded that 300,000 SNPs would be sufficient for multibreed genomic predictions in Bos taurus breeds, but that the associations between causative mutations and SNPs were unlikely to persist across Bos taurus and Bos indicus breeds. With the wide-spread availability of whole-genome sequence data (including the 1000 bull genomes reference set [12]), which can be used to impute SNP datasets to whole-genome sequence, if the assumption that a causative mutation has the same effect across breeds is invoked, genomic prediction using these causative mutations should result in high accuracy genomic predictions from multi-breed evaluations. However only a small increase in multi-breed prediction accuracy has been observed using whole-genome sequence in cattle and sheep [13\u201316]. Kemper et  al. [17] suggested that a Bayesian model with a prior that allowed SNPs to have moderate to large effects (e.g. BayesB [18] or BayesR [19]) may be more suitable for multibreed evaluations with high-density markers than best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) models. Their reasoning was that these models might ascribe larger effects to individual SNPs, with effects possibly persisting across breeds, in contrast to BLUP models that \u201csmear\u201d effects of causal mutations across many SNPs on a large chromosome segment (as a result of the BLUP prior which is all SNPs have small, non-zero effects), which may not persist across breeds. Some evidence supporting this was provided from the analysis of a multi-breed dairy population [17]. In contrast to the models of de Roos [10] and Goddard and Hayes [11], a different approach for multi-breed evaluation is to allow for quantitative trait loci (QTL) with different effects, and/or different QTL segregating across breeds, by treating each breed as a different, but potentially correlated trait [20, 21]. These estimated genetic correlations from this approach indicate the extent of the QTL and their effects, shared across breeds. Refining this type of model to specify the location of QTL that are different across breeds, the breed-of-origin of alleles (BOA) model [22] is based on the hypotheses that \u201cin crossbred populations: (1) effects of SNPs may be breed-specific, and (2) linkage disequilibrium may not be restricted to markers that are tightly linked to the QTL\u201d. They proposed a model for genomic selection to select for commercial crossbred performance with breedspecific effects of SNP alleles, i.e. the model with breedspecific allele effects (BSAM), which subsequently the authors have termed the BOA models [23]. Accuracies of genomic prediction from BOA models based on crossbred populations have been demonstrated to be more accurate than those from models that do not explicitly model the breed-of-origin of alleles, for some but not all traits [24]. The above models have all been implemented and evaluated in Bos taurus breeds. An even greater challenge is the analysis of data from cattle with both Bos indicus and Bos taurus ancestry, as these subspecies diverged 600,000 to 800,000  years ago [25]. Multi-subspecies populations are common in tropical beef production systems in Australia, Latin America and Indonesia, and in tropical dairy production systems in India and Africa, e.g. [26\u201328]. For the analysis of such data, Bolormaa et al. [29] suggested a model that is similar to the BOA model, but at the subspecies level. They suggested that allocating chromosome segments to Bos indicus or Bos taurus origin would take into account the fact, that given the long divergence time between the sub-species, the differences in allele frequencies at QTL would be large, resulting in substantially different SNP-QTL linkage disequilibrium patterns between the sub-species. For multi-sub-species populations, a model that attempts to capture the advantages of both the multi-breed models proposed by de Roos et al. [10], Kemper et al. [17] and the BOA models is the \u201cmulti-subspecies\u201d model proposed by Warburton et al. [30]. In this BayesR model, which is inspired by the model of Bolormaa et al. [29], the sub-species of origin of the haplotypes Page 3 of 13 Hayes et al. Genetics Selection Evolution (2023) 55:71 is assigned, but within each sub-species it is assumed that high-density markers are in linkage disequilibrium with specific causative mutations in the sub-species. Single-step BLUP (ssBLUP) which integrates pedigree, genomic and phenotype information is increasingly used in routine genomic evaluations. The metafounders\u2019 model is a multi-breed extension of ssBLUP [31]. In the usual implementation of ssBLUP, pedigree founders are considered as unrelated. The metafounders\u2019 approach assigns pedigree founders to an ancestral population (a breed or a line). The ancestral populations are represented as a \"metafounder,\" a pseudo-individual included as a founder of the pedigree and similar to an \u201cunknown parent group.\u201d [32]. The metafounders may share a genetic relationship (as in the multi-trait models), which can be estimated from markers. It should be mentioned that none of the above multi-breed models have yet achieved high accuracies of prediction for animals of breeds that are not represented in the reference set, which suggests that more research is required in this area [9]. At present, the solution is to include at least some animals of all the target breed(s), and crossbreds, in the reference set. Perhaps the largest multi-breed beef cattle routine genomic evaluations are conducted in Ireland by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) [33]. The models in these evaluations fit breed proportion as a fixed effect, as a continuous variable (breed proportion for each animal) with a separate effect fitted in the models for each breed. Heterosis in crossbred animals was modelled from pedigree contributions of different breed sires and dams [34]. These evaluations include millions of animals. Efficient single-step methods have been used to combine pedigree, genomic and phenotype information for this population [35]. In practice, there are a number of challenges to overcome for multi-breed predictions, especially in tropical beef cattle where crosses of Bos indicus and Bos taurus cattle are common. In particular, multiple breeds must be measured in the same contemporary groups in order to disentangle contemporary group effects from breed effects. Using commercial data from purebred, crossbred and composite animals (rather than data collected on studs) in multi-breed evaluations is attractive in this regard, as the head-to-head comparison of chromosome segments from different breeds can be done on a large scale. Using commercial data in the reference set may also be attractive because large reference populations can be assembled relatively quickly, for example by collecting records from processing plants where carcass traits and intra-muscular fat are scored on every carcass or pregnancy test records for fertility. Commercial data are also recorded in the target environment for production, so that the genotype-by-environment interaction between stud and commercial environments is no longer an issue (e.g. [36]). However in tropical beef populations, often little is known about breed composition or the heterosis of these animals, and limited or no pedigree is available, so that models such as ssBLUP and metafounders cannot be readily applied. Another challenge in analysing commercial animal data is that, particularly, in tropical environments, the genomes of individual animals can be composed of segments from many breeds, i.e. reflecting the need to balance productivity and adaptation, which results in the use and testing of many breeds in these systems over time. With large numbers of breeds, some of the above models may be computationally challenging; for example the incidence matrices in the BOA models expand to SNPs \u00d7 number of breeds. Here, we propose simple models for multi-breed genomic prediction based on large-scale commercial data that overcome at least some of these problems. One of the models treats breeds as analogous to genetic groups [32], which allows partition of the genetic variance into within-breed and between-breed components, even if a large number of breeds is involved. Our method is similar to the \u2018genomic groups\u2019 approach described by Plieschke et al. [37], which is extended to account for crossbred and composite animals from a large number of breeds.",

We demonstrate that moderately-accurate (0.30\u20130.43) GEBV can be calculated using these models. Treating breed effects as random gave more accurate GEBV than treating breed as fixed. A simple GBLUP model where no breed effects were fitted gave the same accuracy (and correlations of GEBV very close to 1) as a model where GEBV for within-breed and the GEBV for (random) across-breed effects were included. When GEBV were predicted for herds with no data in the reference population, BayesR resulted in the highest accuracy, with 3% accuracy improvement averaged across traits, especially when the validation population was less related to the reference population. Estimates of heterosis from our models were in line with previous estimates from beef cattle. A method for estimating the number of effective breed comparisons for each breed combination accumulated across contemporary groups is presented.\nConclusions When no pedigree is available, breed composition and heterosis for inclusion in multi-breed genomic evaluation can be estimated from genotypes. When GEBV were predicted for herds with no data in the reference population, BayesR resulted in the highest accuracy."

The prime example of genomic selection is in Holstein and Jersey dairy cattle, for which semen samples from many progeny-tested bulls formed the basis of reference *Correspondence: Ben J. Hayes ben.hayes@uq.edu.au 1 Centre for Animal Science, Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation, University of Queensland, St Lucia, QLD 4067, Australia 2 BlackBox Co, Mareeba, QLD 4880, Australia\npopulations [3]. In other livestock populations, the implementation of genomic selection has proved more challenging, both because they consist of many different breeds and crossbreds, and because such ready-made historical reference populations that are available in dairy populations do not exist [4, 5].\nMulti-breed genomic evaluations for livestock are desirable as they allow producers to select sires and dams across breeds, crossbreds and composites, which increase selection intensity. The advantage of multi-breed evaluations for increasing accuracy of genomic prediction, particularly for breeds with smaller reference set sizes, has been demonstrated in dairy cattle [6], sheep [4, 7] and beef cattle [8]. Several approaches for multi-breed genomic predictions have been proposed (see Misztal et\u00a0al. [9] for a comprehensive review). de Roos et\u00a0al. [10] made an assumption that the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) would be shared across breeds if they were sufficiently dense. For this to occur, the causative mutations that affect a trait would have to be the same across breeds, and for multibreed predictions, SNPs would have to be close enough to the mutation so that the linkage disequilibrium phase between SNPs and the causative mutation persists across breeds. As a proxy for SNP\u2013causative mutation linkage disequilibrium phase, they investigated the extent of SNP\u2013SNP linkage disequilibrium across three Bos taurus breeds. They concluded that 300,000 equally-spaced SNPs would be sufficient for multi-breed genomic predictions. Goddard and Hayes [11] extended this analysis to more breeds. They also concluded that 300,000 SNPs would be sufficient for multibreed genomic predictions in Bos taurus breeds, but that the associations between causative mutations and SNPs were unlikely to persist across Bos taurus and Bos indicus breeds. With the wide-spread availability of whole-genome sequence data (including the 1000 bull genomes reference set [12]), which can be used to impute SNP datasets to whole-genome sequence, if the assumption that a causative mutation has the same effect across breeds is invoked, genomic prediction using these causative mutations should result in high accuracy genomic predictions from multi-breed evaluations. However only a small increase in multi-breed prediction accuracy has been observed using whole-genome sequence in cattle and sheep [13\u201316].\nKemper et\u00a0 al. [17] suggested that a Bayesian model with a prior that allowed SNPs to have moderate to large effects (e.g. BayesB [18] or BayesR [19]) may be more suitable for multibreed evaluations with high-density markers than best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) models. Their reasoning was that these models might ascribe larger effects to individual SNPs, with effects possibly persisting across breeds, in contrast to BLUP\nmodels that \u201csmear\u201d effects of causal mutations across many SNPs on a large chromosome segment (as a result of the BLUP prior which is all SNPs have small, non-zero effects), which may not persist across breeds. Some evidence supporting this was provided from the analysis of a multi-breed dairy population [17].\nIn contrast to the models of de Roos [10] and Goddard and Hayes [11], a different approach for multi-breed evaluation is to allow for quantitative trait loci (QTL) with different effects, and/or different QTL segregating across breeds, by treating each breed as a different, but potentially correlated trait [20, 21]. These estimated genetic correlations from this approach indicate the extent of the QTL and their effects, shared across breeds.\nRefining this type of model to specify the location of QTL that are different across breeds, the breed-of-origin of alleles (BOA) model [22] is based on the hypotheses that \u201cin crossbred populations: (1) effects of SNPs may be breed-specific, and (2) linkage disequilibrium may not be restricted to markers that are tightly linked to the QTL\u201d. They proposed a model for genomic selection to select for commercial crossbred performance with breedspecific effects of SNP alleles, i.e. the model with breedspecific allele effects (BSAM), which subsequently the authors have termed the BOA models [23]. Accuracies of genomic prediction from BOA models based on crossbred populations have been demonstrated to be more accurate than those from models that do not explicitly model the breed-of-origin of alleles, for some but not all traits [24].\nThe above models have all been implemented and evaluated in Bos taurus breeds. An even greater challenge is the analysis of data from cattle with both Bos indicus and Bos taurus ancestry, as these subspecies diverged 600,000 to 800,000\u00a0 years ago [25]. Multi-subspecies populations are common in tropical beef production systems in Australia, Latin America and Indonesia, and in tropical dairy production systems in India and Africa, e.g. [26\u201328]. For the analysis of such data, Bolormaa et\u00a0al. [29] suggested a model that is similar to the BOA model, but at the subspecies level. They suggested that allocating chromosome segments to Bos indicus or Bos taurus origin would take into account the fact, that given the long divergence time between the sub-species, the differences in allele frequencies at QTL would be large, resulting in substantially different SNP-QTL linkage disequilibrium patterns between the sub-species. For multi-sub-species populations, a model that attempts to capture the advantages of both the multi-breed models proposed by de Roos et\u00a0al. [10], Kemper et\u00a0al. [17] and the BOA models is the \u201cmulti-subspecies\u201d model proposed by Warburton et\u00a0al. [30]. In this BayesR model, which is inspired by the model of Bolormaa et\u00a0al. [29], the sub-species of origin of the haplotypes\nis assigned, but within each sub-species it is assumed that high-density markers are in linkage disequilibrium with specific causative mutations in the sub-species.\nSingle-step BLUP (ssBLUP) which integrates pedigree, genomic and phenotype information is increasingly used in routine genomic evaluations. The metafounders\u2019 model is a multi-breed extension of ssBLUP [31]. In the usual implementation of ssBLUP, pedigree founders are considered as unrelated. The metafounders\u2019 approach assigns pedigree founders to an ancestral population (a breed or a line). The ancestral populations are represented as a \"metafounder,\" a pseudo-individual included as a founder of the pedigree and similar to an \u201cunknown parent group.\u201d [32]. The metafounders may share a genetic relationship (as in the multi-trait models), which can be estimated from markers. It should be mentioned that none of the above multi-breed models have yet achieved high accuracies of prediction for animals of breeds that are not represented in the reference set, which suggests that more research is required in this area [9]. At present, the solution is to include at least some animals of all the target breed(s), and crossbreds, in the reference set.\nPerhaps the largest multi-breed beef cattle routine genomic evaluations are conducted in Ireland by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) [33]. The models in these evaluations fit breed proportion as a fixed effect, as a continuous variable (breed proportion for each animal) with a separate effect fitted in the models for each breed. Heterosis in crossbred animals was modelled from pedigree contributions of different breed sires and dams [34]. These evaluations include millions of animals. Efficient single-step methods have been used to combine pedigree, genomic and phenotype information for this population [35].\nIn practice, there are a number of challenges to overcome for multi-breed predictions, especially in tropical beef cattle where crosses of Bos indicus and Bos taurus cattle are common. In particular, multiple breeds must be measured in the same contemporary groups in order to disentangle contemporary group effects from breed effects. Using commercial data from purebred, crossbred and composite animals (rather than data collected on studs) in multi-breed evaluations is attractive in this regard, as the head-to-head comparison of chromosome segments from different breeds can be done on a large scale. Using commercial data in the reference set may also be attractive because large reference populations can be assembled relatively quickly, for example by collecting records from processing plants where carcass traits and intra-muscular fat are scored on every carcass or pregnancy test records for fertility. Commercial data are also recorded in the target environment for production, so that the genotype-by-environment interaction between\nstud and commercial environments is no longer an issue (e.g. [36]). However in tropical beef populations, often little is known about breed composition or the heterosis of these animals, and limited or no pedigree is available, so that models such as ssBLUP and metafounders cannot be readily applied.\nAnother challenge in analysing commercial animal data is that, particularly, in tropical environments, the genomes of individual animals can be composed of segments from many breeds, i.e. reflecting the need to balance productivity and adaptation, which results in the use and testing of many breeds in these systems over time. With large numbers of breeds, some of the above models may be computationally challenging; for example the incidence matrices in the BOA models expand to SNPs \u00d7 number of breeds.\nHere, we propose simple models for multi-breed genomic prediction based on large-scale commercial data that overcome at least some of these problems. One of the models treats breeds as analogous to genetic groups [32], which allows partition of the genetic variance into within-breed and between-breed components, even if a large number of breeds is involved. Our method is similar to the \u2018genomic groups\u2019 approach described by Plieschke et\u00a0al. [37], which is extended to account for crossbred and composite animals from a large number of breeds."

            "text": "Fifty-four collaborator beef cattle herds from across tropical Australia participated in data collection for the Northern Genomics project. The properties were located across Northern Australia, including South Western, Central, Western and Northern Queenslandand the Northern Territory of Australia, and the Pilbara region of Western Australia [38]. These regions are characterised by a wet season, and a dry season with little pasture growth. Central and South Western Queensland regions tend to have good to high quality pasture, while Western Queensland and Western Australia regions are arid with low rainfall (350\u00a0 mm or less per year) [38]. The 29,321 heifers enrolled included crossbred and approximately 8000 purebred heifers from at least 14 breeds, i.e. Angus, Belmont Red, Brahman, Charolais, Droughtmaster, Hereford, Limousin, MurrayGrey, SantaGertrudis, Shorthorn, Wagyu, Boran, Senepol, Tuli (for genetic distances and diversity parameters of these breeds see [39]).\nImportantly, producers in this project are committed to have bulls in the paddock for at least 6\u00a0weeks. Traits measured from 2015 to 2020 on the heifers included live weight, hip height and body condition score (BCS) at an average of 600\u00a0days, and a heifer puberty trait. The heifer puberty trait was cycling or not cycling by an average\nof 600\u00a0days (heifer puberty) assessed by the presence or absence of corpus luteum using ovary scanning [40]. To maximise genetic variation, the trait is actually measured when an estimated (by average live weight) 50% of the heifers are pubertal, i.e., at 1 to 2.5\u00a0years of age. Further details on the phenotypes are described in Copley et\u00a0al. [38].\nAll heifers were genotyped with the 35\u00a0k or 50\u00a0k TropBeef SNP array by Neogen, Australasia. SNPs were removed if more than 10% of the genotypes were missing for that SNP. If an individual genotype had a GC score less 0.6, it was set to missing and recovered by imputation. Genotypes were imputed up to 709,768 SNPs (bovine high-density (HD) array) using the findhap software [41] and a panel of 4506 cattle from relevant breeds that were genotyped with the Bovine HD array. This panel of HD SNPs was obtained by removing the SNPs that had less than 10 copies of the minor allele in the imputation reference panel, and the SNPs that had more than 10% missing genotypes. All heifer breeds were represented by at least 50 animals that were genotyped with the Bovine HD array in the imputation reference set. The accuracy of imputation was at least 93% for all breeds/ crossbreds."

            "text": "First, we estimated the breed proportions of each heifer for each of the 14 breeds known to be in the dataset using the 35\u00a0K array data only (Fig.\u00a01). A separate large dataset consisting of 4506 purebred cattle was used to estimate SNP effects for breed composition. This dataset included at least 50 cattle from all the breeds that comprised the\nheifers\u2019 ancestry. A genomic (G)BLUP model was fitted, where the phenotype was 1 if the animal was from that breed and 0 if not [42, 43]. The effect of each SNP for the proportion of each breed was then derived by back-solving for the SNP effects, treating breed as a trait [44], and the resulting prediction equations for each breed were used to estimate the breed proportions in the heifers.\nTo predict genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV), four multi-breed models were evaluated.\n\u2022 Model 1 (BREEDFIXED) was:\nwhere y is the vector of trait records (Clscore, live weight, hip height or body condition score); \u00b5 is the population mean, and 1n is a vector of 1s; f is the vector of fixed effects including contemporary group, the herd + birth year + paddock (enclosed field) that the heifers were in before they were gathered together for trait recording (there were 148 contemporary groups, each group included at least 50 animals), the year of recording (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020), and f also included a linear covariate of the heterozygosity of each heifer as measured by the proportion of marker genotypes that were heterozygous (to capture heterosis effects); X is the design matrix that relates fixed effects to records; W is the matrix of records \u00d7 number of breeds, with each element, measuring the proportion of each breed in the heifers as described above (14 breeds); b is the vector of fixed effects for each of the 14 breeds; u is the vector of random genetic effects ~ N (0,G\u03c3 2g ) with G being the genomic relationship\ny = 1n\u00b5+ Xf +Wb+ Zu + \u03b5,\nmatrix between all the heifers and \u03c3 2g the genetic variance captured by the SNPs, with G constructed according to method 1 of [45]; Z is the design matrix that relates records to animals; \u03b5 is the vector of random deviations ~ N (0, I\u03c3 2e ) with I an animal-by-animal identity matrix and \u03c3 2e is the error variance.\nThere were at least 50 animals in each contemporary group. Marker heterozygosity in the dataset ranged from ~ 0.25 (for a purebred) to 0.5 (for an F1 cross). Maximum heterosis was achieved for F1 crosses (e.g. when marker heterozygosity was 0.5) and minimum heterosis was achieved for purebreds (when marker heterozygosity was 0.25). Accordingly, we re-scaled the estimate of heterosis to be on the scale of purebred (0) to F1 (1). For this model, variance components were estimated with the genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) tool [44], using the greml option with separate files for fixed effects (covar) and covariates (qcovar), and the heritability of the traits (in this case, the proportion of phenotypic variance captured by the SNPs) was estimated as h2 = \u03c3\u0302 2g /(\u03c3\u0302 2g + \u03c3\u0302 2e ). The GEBV for this\nmodel were predicted as: GEBV = Wb\u0302+ u\u0302.\n\u2022 Model 2 (BREEDRANDOM) was:\nwhere effects are defined as above, and a is a vector of random variables (the breed effects combined into one value for an animal) and follows ~ N (0,B\u03c3 2b ) , where B = WWT . A small amount (0.01) was added to the diagonal to aid with matrix inversion. If desired, the estimates of breed effects can be obtained from this model using the following derivation. If we assume that the combined across-breed breeding value, or more precisely the effect pertaining to a particular breed compisition ( a ) is a weighted sum of (the now random) individual breed effects ( b ), then the estimates of breed effects can be obtained as follows:\nNoting that a\u0302 = Wb\u0302 , multiplying both sides by WT results in WTa\u0302 = WTWb\u0302 . Then, multiplying both sides by the inverse of WTW we obtain [ WTW ]\u22121 W T a\u0302 = [ WTW ]\u22121 W T Wb\u0302 , such that the estimates of breed effects equal b\u0302 = [ WTW ]\u22121 W T a\u0302.\nFor this model, GEBV = a\u0302 + u\u0302.\n\u2022 Model 3 (NOBREED)\nA GBLUP model was also fitted where no breed effects were fitted, in order to investigate if the GEBV from this model were the same as a\u0302 + u\u0302 (i.e. within- and across-breed estimates of the breeding values from the\ny = 1n\u00b5+ Xf + Za + Zu + \u03b5,\nBREEDRANDOM model). The model for NOBREED was:\nwhere terms are as above. For this model GEBV = u\u0302.\n\u2022 Model 4 (BAYESR)\nFinally a BayesR model was fitted (BAYESR):\nwhere effects are as above. S is the matrix of records by animal allocating genotypes to records, where the genotypes were recorded as 0 = AA, 1 = AB, 2 = BB, and in the matrix S , these genotypes were centred and standardized; g is a vector of SNP effects. In BayesR, the variance associated with the ith SNP is assumed to come from one of four distributions, either \u03c32i = 0 , or 10 \u22124 \u03c3 2 g , or 10\u22123\u03c32g , or 10\u22122\u03c3 2 g ; where \u03c32g is the genetic variance of the trait. This allows the BayesR model [19] to have a flexible SNP effect distribution, which is a mixture of four possible normal distributions, either N (0, 0) or N ( 0, 10\u22124\u03c32g ) , or N (0, 10\u22123\u03c32g) , or N (0, 10\u22122\u03c3 2 g) , all with a mean of 0 but with different variances. Note that no breed effects were fitted in this model.\nFor the BAYESR model, GEBV = Sg\u0302."

The breed composition of these validation contemporary groups (in total, 3790 heifers) ranged from purebred Brahman to crossbreds of Bos taurus breeds. Genomic estimated breeding values were predicted for the heifers in the 10 excluded contemporary groups, then the GEBV were correlated with the actual phenotypes (adjusted for fixed effects) of the heifers within each contemporary group, and then averaged over the 10 groups. This correlation was divided by the square root of the heritability of the trait to obtain the accuracy of genomic prediction. Validations were also performed when the data for the entire herd for each of the 10 randomly chosen herds was removed. Genetic parameters for all the models were reestimated when the validation sets were removed.\nWe also assessed the accuracy of genomic predictions for heifer puberty in a completely independent dataset, i.e. the Beef CRC groups of 894 and 1088 Brahman\ny = 1n\u00b5+ Xf + Zu + \u03b5,\ny = 1n\u00b5+ Xf + Sg + \u03b5,\nand Tropical composite cattle (respectively). These cattle were phenotyped for a different, but related fertility trait, than the one we used, which was age at first corpus luteum, assessed by ultrasound scanning at six-week intervals [46]. Genotypes for these cattle were imputed to the same 709,768 SNPs used in the genomic predictions.\nUltimately for multi-breed evaluations, head-to-head comparisons of breeds in the same herd/environment are necessary. We assessed the number of head-to-head comparisons as \u2211n i W \u2032 i Wi , where for each of the n contemporary groups in the dataset, Wi is a matrix of breed proportions in contemporary group i , of dimensions equal to the number of heifers in the contemporary group \u00d7 number of breeds. This formula sums the number of head-to-head comparisons made within each contemporary group, then for each breed-by-breed comparison sums across contemporary groups. Standard errors on breed-by-breed comparisons can also be calculated, and these reflect the number of head-to-head comparisons within contemporary groups. An example of standard errors is given for the Angus comparisons (see Additional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S1)."

BAYESR gave slightly higher accuracies, for all traits, when the validation was for all data for the removed 10 validation herds\nTa bl\ne 2\nVa ria\nnc e\nco m\npo ne\nnt s\nan d\nhe rit\nab ili\nty e\nst im\nat es\nfr om\nfo ur\nm ul\ntibr\nee d\nm od\nel s\nfo r t\nro pi\nca lly\n-a da\npt ed\nb ee\nf h ei\nfe r t\nra its\na t a\npp ro\nxi m\nat el\ny 60\n0 da\nys o\nf a ge\nVa ria\nnc e\nco m\npo ne\nnt s\nar e\nth e\nge ne\ntic v\nai ra\nnc e,\nV g\nan d\nVe th\ne er\nro r v\nar ia\nnc e.\nIn a\ndd iti\non , t\nhe B\nRE ED\nRA N\nD O\nM m\nod el\ne st\nim at\nes w\nith in\n-b re\ned (V\ng_ w\n) a nd\na cr\nos s-\nbr ee\nd ge\nne tic\nv ar\nia nc\ne co\nm po\nne nt\ns (V\ng_ b)\nN um\nbe r o f re co rd\ns BR\nEE D\nFI XE\nD BR\nEE D\nRA N\nD O\nM N\nO BR\nEE D\nBA YE\nSR\nVg Ve\nVg _w\nVg _b\nVe Vg\nVe Vg\nVe\nVa ria\nnc e\nco m\npo ne\nnt s*\nLi ve\nw ei\ngh t (\nkg )\n26 ,7\n21 45\n5. 7\n\u00b1 1\n9. 0\n10 06\n.9 \u00b1\n1 4.\n7 44\n4. 5\n\u00b1 1\n9. 0\n36 7.\n8 \u00b1\n1 90\n.4 10\n27 .7\n\u00b1 1\n4. 7\n45 5.\n5 \u00b1\n1 9.\n0 10\n22 .8\n\u00b1 1\n4. 7\n46 1.\n1 \u00b1\n1 9.\n0 10\n06 .1\n\u00b1 1\n6. 6\nH ip\nh ei\ngh t (\nm m\n) 25\n,5 67\n92 3.\n5 \u00b1\n3 3.\n7 13\n93 .9\n\u00b1 2\n3. 0\n96 0.\n5 \u00b1\n2 2.\n2 66\n8. 7\n\u00b1 3\n39 .8\n13 41\n.8 \u00b1\n3 3.\n2 96\n9. 4\n\u00b1 3\n3. 9\n14 07\n.2 \u00b1\n2 2.\n9 92\n0. 2\n\u00b1 3\n0. 0\n14 47\n.8 \u00b1\n2 6.\n6\nBo dy\nc on\ndi tio\nn sc\nor e\n26 ,7\n94 0.\n03 \u00b1\n0 .0\n01 0.\n10 \u00b1\n0 .0\n01 0.\n03 \u00b1\n0 .0\n01 0.\n00 3\n\u00b1 0\n.0 03\n0. 10\n\u00b1 0\n.0 01\n0. 03\n\u00b1 0\n.0 01\n0. 10\n\u00b1 0\n.0 01\n0. 03\n\u00b1 0\n.0 01\n0. 10\n\u00b1 0\n.0 01\nH ei\nfe r p\nub er\nty 29\n,3 67\n0. 05\n\u00b1 0\n.0 02\n0. 16\n\u00b1 0\n.0 02\n0. 05\n\u00b1 0\n.0 02\n0. 02\n\u00b1 0\n.0 14\n0. 10\n\u00b1 0\n.0 14\n0. 05\n\u00b1 0\n.0 02\n0. 16\n\u00b1 0\n.0 02\n0. 05\n\u00b1 0\n.0 02\n0. 15\n\u00b1 0\n.0 02\nH er\nita bi\nlit ie\ns\nLi ve\nw ei\ngh t (\nkg )\n26 ,7\n21 0.\n30 \u00b1\n0 .0\n1 0.\n24 \u00b1\n0 .0\n3 0.\n20 \u00b1\n0 .0\n8 0.\n31 \u00b1\n0 .0\n1 0.\n31 \u00b1\n0 .0\n1\nH ip\nh ei\ngh t (\nm m\n) 25\n,5 67\n0. 40\n\u00b1 0\n.0 1\n0. 32\n\u00b1 0\n.0 4\n0. 23\n\u00b1 0\n.0 9\n0. 41\n\u00b1 0\n.0 1\n0. 39\n\u00b1 0\n.0 1\nBo dy\nc on\ndi tio\nn sc\nor e\n26 ,7\n94 0.\n22 \u00b1\n0 .0\n1 0.\n22 \u00b1\n0 .0\n1 0.\n02 \u00b1\n0 .0\n2 0.\n22 \u00b1\n0 .0\n1 0.\n24 \u00b1\n0 .0\n1\nH ei\nfe r p\nub er\nty 29\n,3 67\n0. 22\n\u00b1 0\n.0 1\n0. 20\n\u00b1 0\n.0 2\n0. 10\n\u00b1 0\n.0 5\n0. 23\n\u00b1 0\n.0 1\n0. 25\n\u00b1 0\n.0 1"

This negative correlation is expected, as a younger age at corpus luetum should be associated with a higher probability that the heifer has a corpus luteum at 600\u00a0days. The stronger negative correlation in the Brahmans than in the Tropical composites, may reflect the substantial representation of Brahmans in the reference population.\nThe number of head-to-head comparisons that were possible from the dataset and allowed estimation of the breed effects, was largest for Angus versus Brahman (337), Brahman versus Droughtmaster (924) and\nBrahman versus Santa Gertrudis (421), but smallest for Wagyu and Belmont Red (Table\u00a04)."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "This study demonstrates that moderate accuracies of multi-breed genomic prediction can be achieved from large-scale commercial tropical beef reference datasets. Genomic heritabilities were consistent with previous estimates based on pedigree data for these traits for tropically-adapted beef cattle [40], as well as the heterotic effects [46] and breed effects [47\u201349].\nIn multi-breed commercial data, the challenges of unknown breed composition and level of heterosis can be solved using estimates of these parameters that are obtained directly from the genotype data, as previously demonstrated in both cattle and pigs [50\u201353], provided there is a reference population of purebred genotypes. Using crossbred data allows head-to-head comparison\nof chromosome segments derived from different breeds, which allows separation of breed effects from contemporary group effects, at least to some extent (Fig.\u00a02).\nWhen cattle are derived from many breeds, and particularly when some of these breeds are represented by only a small number of individuals or only as a small proportion of the genome of a limited number of animals, treating breeds as a random effect rather than a fixed effect appears to result in more accurate multi-breed genomic evaluations. This is likely because when breeds are treated as a fixed effect, the effects for breeds with limited representation in the dataset are over-estimated in magnitude, which reduces the accuracy of the multibreed GEBV.\nThe BREEDRANDOM model is attractive in that it results in two GEBV, a within-breed GEBV and a (single) across-breed GEBV, and it also partitions the genetic variance into within-breed and across-breed components. This may be useful for comparisons with existing withinbreed evaluations, and for understanding how genetic variation is portioned within and between breeds. However, care should be taken when implementing this model; for example, if breeds are nested within environments, the breed effect will capture the environment effect as well, resulting in erroneous genomic evaluations (note that this will affect other models as well). The \u03c3 2b in the BREEDRANDOM model is the variation in the population due to the different means for the traits for different breeds, which in turn are a result of either different QTL segregating in different breeds, the same QTL segregating across breeds at different frequencies, as well as different linkage disequilibrium patterns between SNP sand QTL in the different breeds. The differences across traits that we observed in the partitioning of the withinbreed and between-breed variances is likely to be, at least\npartly, due to different QTL segregating in the Bos indicus and Bos taurus populations [29, 30].\nIf the allele frequencies in the base population for each breed were calculated, and further corrected to represent an F1 cross for each breed, \u03c3 2b would then reflect the variance in the base population from which all breeds diverged [19, 54]. This would be an interesting approach and requires further investigation.\nFitting a separate random effect for breed, and allowing the genomic relationship matrix to capture breed effects (e.g. BREEDRANDOM and NOBREED models) resulted in very similar GEBV. The NOBREED model may be easier to implement as only one genomic relationship matrix is included in the model; however the NOBREED model does not partition the within- or across-breed genetic variance. Plieschke et\u00a0al. [37] made a similar observation with both their genetic group model and their standard GBLUP, which were similar to our BREEDRANDOM and NOBREED models, respectively.\nGenomic predictions from BAYESR were slightly more accurate for all traits than those from BREEDRANDOM, when the validation set included entire herds, but accuracies from the two models were very similar when the validation set included only the last contemporary group of animals from the 10 validation herds. This is likely because when the reference population includes data from the validation herds (other contemporary groups, except for the most recent one, from the validation herds were included in the reference set), there are some substantial genomic relationships between the reference and the validation sets (e.g. half sibs, quarter sibs), and GBLUP can take advantage of these for quite accurate prediction. When entire herds are dropped out, the relationships between the reference and validation sets are\nmore distant and prediction is based more on individual SNP effects, which favours BAYESR.\nOne issue with the BREEDRANDOM and NOBREED models described here is that as breed proportions in the dataset change over time (as more animals are genotyped), the G matrix will be centred and scaled differently, such that variance components will be data-set dependent. REML updates of variance components will be required for each situation. This will have to be pointed out to the users of the GEBV. However, since no pedigree is used, we do not have the problem of the A and G matrices being on different bases, which may occur in a single step analysis, e.g. [9].\nIt is important to note that, in theory, models used to predict (and properly define) estimated breeding values in crossbred populations should allow different (additive) variances in each purebred population, as well as in each crossbred population [55\u201357]. We have not taken this approach here, because the size and structure of our dataset are unlikely to support the estimation of 14 within-breed variances as well as variances for each breed \u00d7 breed interactions. Nevertheless, as the dataset gets larger, it may be worth attempting a more precise partitioning of the variance to assess if higher accuracies of prediction could be achieved with such models."

            "text": "In conclusion, data from crossbred and composite commercial animals (with no pedigree) can be used to construct reference populations for genomic prediction, provided the data collected are of high quality (e.g., consistent measurement protocols, accurate matching of IDs and records). Such data could be collected on a very large scale, for example for carcass traits from processing plants, and for some fertility traits. Breed composition of animals can be recovered from the marker genotypes (provided there is a reference population of pure-bred animal genotypes), as marker heterozygosity which can be used as a proxy for heterosis. Extensive head-to-head comparisons of chromosome segments from different breeds in the same contemporary group are necessary for accurate multi-breed genomic evaluations, and the extent of these comparisons in a dataset can be determined from the genomic data.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12711- 023- 00847-6.\nAdditional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S1.
