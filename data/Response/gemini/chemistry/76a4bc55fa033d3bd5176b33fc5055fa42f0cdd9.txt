1. **Investigating the effects of different processing methods on the release and bioaccessibility of IBPs.** This could involve comparing the effects of thermal processing, non-thermal processing, and fermentation on the release of IBPs from different food sources.
2. **Developing new methods for the extraction and analysis of IBPs.** This could involve developing new solvents or extraction techniques that are more effective at releasing IBPs from food matrices.
3. **Studying the metabolism and bioavailability of IBPs in humans.** This could involve using in vitro and in vivo models to track the absorption, distribution, and excretion of IBPs after consumption.
4. **Investigating the potential health benefits of IBPs.** This could involve conducting clinical trials to assess the effects of IBPs on various health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes.
5. **Exploring the use of IBPs as functional ingredients in food products.** This could involve developing new food products that are fortified with IBPs and evaluating their potential health benefits.
