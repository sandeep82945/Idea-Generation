    "abstractText": "Very large mass ratio binary black hole systems are of interest both as a clean limit of the two-body problem in general relativity, as well as for their importance as sources of low-frequency gravitational waves. At lowest order, the smaller body moves along a geodesic of the larger black hole\u2019s spacetime. Accurate models of such systems require post-geodesic corrections to this motion. Post-geodesic effects that drive the small body away from the geodesic include the gravitational self force, which incorporates the backreaction of gravitational-wave emission, and the spin-curvature force, which arises from coupling of the small body\u2019s spin to the black hole\u2019s spacetime curvature. In this paper, we describe a method for precisely computing bound orbits of spinning bodies about black holes. Our analysis builds off of pioneering work by Witzany which demonstrated how to describe the motion of a spinning body to linear order in the small body\u2019s spin. Exploiting the fact that in the large mass-ratio limit spinning-body orbits are close to geodesics (in a sense that can be made precise) and using closed-form results due to van de Meent describing precession of the small body\u2019s spin along black hole orbits, we develop a frequency-domain formulation of the motion which can be solved very precisely. We examine a range of orbits with this formulation, focusing in this paper on orbits which are eccentric and nearly equatorial (i.e., the orbit\u2019s motion is O(S) out of the equatorial plane), but for which the small body\u2019s spin is arbitrarily oriented. We discuss generic orbits with general small-body spin orientation in a companion paper. We characterize the behavior of these orbits, contrasting them with geodesics, and show how the small body\u2019s spin shifts the frequencies \u03a9r and \u03a9\u03c6 which affect orbital motion. These frequency shifts change accumulated phases which are direct gravitational-wave observables, illustrating the importance of precisely characterizing these quantities for gravitational-wave observations.",

Hughes Department of Physics and MIT Kavli Institute, MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA\nVery large mass ratio binary black hole systems are of interest both as a clean limit of the two-body problem in general relativity, as well as for their importance as sources of low-frequency gravitational waves. At lowest order, the smaller body moves along a geodesic of the larger black hole\u2019s spacetime. Accurate models of such systems require post-geodesic corrections to this motion. Post-geodesic effects that drive the small body away from the geodesic include the gravitational self force, which incorporates the backreaction of gravitational-wave emission, and the spin-curvature force, which arises from coupling of the small body\u2019s spin to the black hole\u2019s spacetime curvature. In this paper, we describe a method for precisely computing bound orbits of spinning bodies about black holes. Our analysis builds off of pioneering work by Witzany which demonstrated how to describe the motion of a spinning body to linear order in the small body\u2019s spin. Exploiting the fact that in the large mass-ratio limit spinning-body orbits are close to geodesics (in a sense that can be made precise) and using closed-form results due to van de Meent describing precession of the small body\u2019s spin along black hole orbits, we develop a frequency-domain formulation of the motion which can be solved very precisely. We examine a range of orbits with this formulation, focusing in this paper on orbits which are eccentric and nearly equatorial (i.e., the orbit\u2019s motion is O(S) out of the equatorial plane), but for which the small body\u2019s spin is arbitrarily oriented. We discuss generic orbits with general small-body spin orientation in a companion paper. We characterize the behavior of these orbits, contrasting them with geodesics, and show how the small body\u2019s spin shifts the frequencies \u2126r and \u2126\u03c6 which affect orbital motion. These frequency shifts change accumulated phases which are direct gravitational-wave observables, illustrating the importance of precisely characterizing these quantities for gravitational-wave observations.\nI.

            "text": "Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are stellar-mass compact objects (of mass \u00b5) which orbit a massive black hole (mass M) and inspiral due to the backreaction of gravitational-wave (GW) emission. They are predicted to be a key source of low-frequency gravitational waves, which will be targeted by the planned space-based Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) [1, 2]. The mass ratios of EMRI systems are small; \u03b5 \u2261 \u00b5/M lies in the range 10\u22127\u201310\u22124. This means that the smaller object makes O(1/\u03b5) \u223c 104\u2013107 orbits during inspiral. By matching phase with theoretical model waveforms (\u201ctemplates\u201d) over those many thousands or millions of orbits, it is expected that EMRI GWs will make possible very precise measurements. Some of the science goals of EMRI measurements are to precisely determine the properties of the EMRI\u2019s black hole and its inspiraling companion [3], to probe that black hole\u2019s astrophysical environment [4\u20137], and to robustly test the Kerr nature of the black hole spacetime [8\u201312].\nAn EMRI\u2019s mass ratio means that these systems can be treated perturbatively. This facilitates developing useful theoretical models, since models of the system can be developed using techniques from black hole perturbation theory \u2014 we treat the binary as general relativity\u2019s exact Kerr solution [13], and add a perturbation which describes the smaller body. In addition to accurately describing systems with extreme mass ratios, applications\nof perturbation theory play a role in helping to understand intermediate mass ratio and even comparable mass binaries [14\u201318]. Especially as the ground-based detectors uncover systems with very unequal mass components [19, 20], there is great interest and potential in combining perturbation theory with numerical relativity [21] and analytic strong-field approaches [22\u201327].\nAt zeroth order in the mass ratio \u03b5, the small body travels along a geodesic of the background spacetime of the massive black hole with four-momentum p\u03b1, obeying\nDp\u03b1\nd\u03c4 = 0 , (1.1)\nwhere D/d\u03c4 is the covariant derivative computed along the orbit and \u03c4 is proper time. When finite mass ratio and finite size effects are taken into account, the righthand side of Eq. (1.1) is replaced by a force f\u03b1. An example of such a force is the gravitational self force, which describes the small body\u2019s interaction with its own spacetime curvature [28\u201334]. The self force encodes the backreaction which drives GW-driven inspiral, as well as conservative effects that shift orbital properties relative to the geodesic.\nIn this paper, we examine the force that arises due to the coupling of the background curvature with the spin of the small body, the spin-curvature force f\u03b1S . The equation governing the small body\u2019s motion becomes\nDp\u03b1\nd\u03c4 = f\u03b1S \u2261 \u2212\n1 2 R\u03b1 \u03bd\u03bb\u03c3u \u03bdS\u03bb\u03c3 . (1.2)\nThis is one of the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations, and will be discussed in detail in Section III. Here R\u03b1 \u03bd\u03bb\u03c3\nar X\niv :2\n20 1.\n13 33\n4v 2\n[ gr\n-q c]\n2 2\nM ar\n2 02\n2\n2 is the Riemann curvature tensor of the background spacetime, and u\u03bd is the 4-velocity associated with the smaller\u2019s orbital motion. The tensor S\u03bb\u03c3 describes the spin of the orbiting body. If that body is a Kerr black hole, S\u03bb\u03c3 \u221d s\u00b52 where s is a dimensionless spin parameter with s \u2264 1. The spin-curvature force thus affects the orbiting body\u2019s motion at next-to-leading-order in mass ratio, just like many important self force effects [31, 33, 35]."

            "text": "A great deal of work, both numerical and analytic, has gone into developing models for the dynamics of and gravitational waves produced by systems containing spinning members. Two limiting approaches have been used extensively for analytic modeling of such systems: the post-Newtonian PN approximation, formally good when members of the binary are widely separated and orbital speeds are small compared to light, and the extreme mass-ratio limit described in Sec. I A. The effective-onebody (EOB) framework synthesizes elements from postNewtonian, extreme-mass-ratio, and numerical relativity results in order to construct a useful prescription for modeling inspirals across a wide parameter space. The dynamics of comparable mass binaries with spinning components has been explored in many post-Newtonian studies [36\u201342]; complementary to this, binaries with spinning members have been investigated extensively in numerical relativity simulations [43\u201348]. Considerable work has also been undertaken to develop EOB models that include spin and quantify their reliability [24\u201327, 49\u201351]; a comparison of spinning effective one body Hamiltonians can be found in Ref. [52].\nIn addition, studies of the relativistic three-body problem correspond to the spinning two-body problem in certain regimes. For example, in hierarchical triple systems, there can be a correspondence between the orbital angular momentum of the so-called \u201cinner\u201d binary (a twobody system which itself orbits a massive black hole) and the spin of a test body. This correspondence holds if the separation of the inner binary is much smaller than the curvature scale associated with the black hole about which the inner binary orbits [53].\nA number of studies have examined the motion of spinning bodies orbiting black holes. Many of these studies have focused either on numerical treatment of the Papapetrou equations (for example, Refs. [54\u201356]), or on constrained orbital geometries such as nearly circular or nearly equatorial orbits. For example, Ref. [57] finds analytic expressions for the radial, meridional, and spin precession frequencies, including terms quadratic in spin for the limit of nearly circular, nearly equatorial orbits (see in particular Sec. IV B of [57]).\nTreating the system to first order in the small body\u2019s spin has astrophysical relevance in the context of EMRIs. A scheme of this type was outlined in Ref. [58] and\nelucidated further in Refs. [59, 60]. Spinning-body orbits have been computed to first order in spin using similar frameworks in Refs. [61\u201363]. A useful effective potential approach presented in Refs. [64\u201366] describes equatorial orbits when the spin of the small body is aligned with the orbit. This method has been employed to compute corrections to orbital frequencies and explore resonance effects for equatorial orbits [67\u201369]. Corrections to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) location of spinningbody motion have also been calculated [70\u201375].\nAnother thread to this research is the use of a canonical Hamiltonian framework to describe the motion of a spinning body [76]. An explicit Hamiltonian for the Newton-Wigner supplementary condition was presented to linear order in spin in Ref. [77], and later extended to quadratic order by Vines et al. [78]. This canonical Hamiltonian picture provides the basis for certain spinning EOB models [79, 80]. Witzany et al. presented an overview of Hamiltonians for several commonly used spin supplementary conditions, including the TulczyjewDixon condition, in Ref. [81]. A Hamilton-Jacobi formulation of spinning-body motion, which exploits the separability of parallel transport in order to determine the turning points analytically, is also known and can be used to compute corrections to the orbital frequencies [82]. A covariant Hamiltonian formalism has also been used to describe spinning-body motion [83, 84]. This approach is used in Ref. [85] to describe circular orbits of spinning bodies in Kerr without truncating higher order spin terms, as well as to study non-planar bound orbits in a Schwarzschild background.\nPost-Newtonian analyses long ago indicated that spinning binaries exhibit chaotic dynamics [86\u201388]. The integrability of eccentric, spinning back hole binaries up to second post-Newtonian order was demonstrated in Ref. [41], with action angle variables presented explicitly in Ref. [42]. In the extreme mass ratio limit, numerical studies in both Schwarzschild [89] and Kerr [90, 91] backgrounds found evidence for chaotic motion. However, the linear-in-spin Hamilton-Jacobi analysis of Witzany [82] found that the equations of motion \u201calmost\u201d separate \u2014 the librational motion in the radial and polar directions is coupled only by the way in which the libration region varies over an orbit. As such, Witzany shows that the equations of motion are amenable to computing important quantities such as frequencies associated with the orbits of spinning bodies. This analysis indicates that terms beyond linear in spin are necessary in order for orbits to exhibit chaos. Indeed, numerical studies have show that prolonged resonances leading to chaotic motion can be attributed to terms that are second order in spin [92].\nNon-integrability and the possibility of chaotic dynamics in the orbits of spinning bodies has received particular attention due to the implications of this for gravitational wave detection [93]. However, even if the motion remains perfectly predictable, it is crucial to understand and quantify the effect a small body\u2019s spin has on\n3 the dynamics of black hole orbits and the gravitational waves produced in spinning-body EMRI systems. The measurability of the secondary spin and its influence on EMRI parameter estimation has been assessed in previous studies [94\u201397]. Quasi-circular equatorial orbits with the spin of the small body aligned with the orbit provide a useful limit that has been studied extensively, and is often used to verify new methods for calculating gravitational wave fluxes [98\u2013102]. Gravitational-wave fluxes from equatorial orbits with aligned spin [65, 103] and quasi-circular orbits with misaligned spin [104] have also been well studied. Warburton and collaborators investigated the gravitational wave emission of a spinning body with misaligned spin orbiting a non-rotating black hole in Ref. [105]. The impact of different spin supplementary conditions on gravitational wave fluxes has been explored for both Schwarzschild [106] and Kerr [107] black holes. Finally, as we were completing this analysis, Mathews et al. presented a detailed examination of the impact of a spinning secondary on the self force [108], focused on the simplest case (Schwarzschild background, spin parallel to orbit, circular configuration)."

            "text": "In this work, we examine orbits under the influence of the spin-curvature force f\u03b1S . Because our focus is on extreme mass-ratio systems, we truncate all spin effects at leading order in the small body\u2019s spin. Under the assumption that the small body is itself a Kerr black hole (an astrophysically plausible assumption for EMRI systems), the small body\u2019s spin has a magnitude that scales with its mass squared. Terms beyond linear in spin thus scale very steeply with the system\u2019s mass ratio. At this order, a closed-form description of the spin precession is known [17], amounting to parallel transport of a vector along a Kerr geodesic. With the precessional dynamics of the small body\u2019s spin in hand, we can straightforwardly compute the spin-curvature force. From this, we find the spinning-body trajectory [r(t), \u03b8(t), \u03c6(t)] consistent with the spin-curvature force by solving Eq. (1.2).\nFollowing Ref. [17], we characterize the small body\u2019s spin using a set of quantities {S1, S2, S3} which represent the components of its spin vector projected onto three legs of a tetrad used in the closed-form analysis of its precession (see Sec. III D). (A fourth component S0, corresponding to the remaining leg of the tetrad, is constrained to be zero by the spin supplementary condition discussed in Sec. III B.) We write its magnitude\nS = \u221a S2\u2016 + S 2 \u22a5, where S\u2016 = S 3 describes the component\nnormal to the orbital plane, and S\u22a5 = \u221a (S1)2 + (S2)2 describes its magnitude within this plane. If S\u22a5 6= 0, then components of the spin vector oscillate in the orbital plane with a frequency \u2126s, describing a precession of the spin vector along its orbit; this frequency is described in more detail in Sec. III D, and computed in Ref.\n[17]. At leading order in spin, the quantities S\u22a5 and S\u2016 (and thus S) are constants of motion along the spinning body\u2019s orbit.\nBecause we consider the small body\u2019s spin to be a small parameter, the spinning-body orbits we examine are \u201cclose to\u201d geodesic orbits (in a sense made more precise later). We begin our discussion of spinning-body orbits by examining how we parameterize bound Kerr geodesics. The radial motion of bound geodesics is typically described using a semi-latus rectum p and an eccentricity e, such that the orbit oscillates between apoastron at r1 = pM/(1 \u2212 e) and periastron at r2 = pM/(1 + e). The polar angle \u03b8 of a bound orbit oscillates such that \u2212 sin I \u2264 cos \u03b8 \u2264 sin I. Using these bounds, we write these motions\nr\u0302 = pM\n1 + e cos \u03c7\u0302r , cos \u03b8\u0302 = sin I cos \u03c7\u0302\u03b8 . (1.3)\nHere and throughout this paper, we use a \u201chat\u201d accent (e.g. r\u0302) to denote a quantity which is evaluated on a geodesic. The definitions (1.3) introduce the angles \u03c7\u0302r and \u03c7\u0302\u03b8, which are generalizations of \u201ctrue anomaly\u201d angles often used in discussions of orbits in Newtonian gravity. The libration range of the geodesics does not change over an orbit, so that p, e and I are all constants of motion. Geodesics can be equivalently characterized by another set of constants of motion: E\u0302, L\u0302z and Q\u0302, which denote a geodesic\u2019s energy, axial angular momentum and Carter constant respectively. These quantities are discussed in more detail in Sec. II.\nSpinning-body orbits cannot in general be parameterized in the same way as geodesics using Eq. (1.3). For the \u201cnearly equatorial\u201d cases that we consider in this paper, we find the following parameterization robustly describes these orbits:\nr = pM\n1 + e cos\u03c7r , \u03b8 =\n\u03c0 2 + \u03b4\u03d1S . (1.4)\nThis radial motion has turning points at r = pM/(1\u00b1e), exactly as for geodesic orbits. However, the anomaly angle \u03c7r is not the same as the anomaly angle \u03c7\u0302r which describes geodesic motion. We elaborate on the difference between these angles in Sec. V. The polar angle deviates from the equatorial plane by \u03b4\u03d1S , a quantity with an amplitude O(S\u22a5) which oscillates at harmonics of the frequency \u2126s. If S\u22a5 = 0, so that the small body\u2019s spin is aligned or anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum, then \u03b4\u03d1S = 0. Aligned and anti-aligned orbits can be purely equatorial.\nFor generic orbits, we find that the libration regions in both r and \u03b8 must be modified to include oscillations at precession frequency \u2126s. We defer the details of how this is handled to our companion analysis, Ref. [109], which examines generic orbits of spinning bodies with generic spin-orbit configuration.\n4"

            "text": "In the remainder of this paper, we present our method for precisely computing bound orbits of spinning bodies orbiting black holes. We begin by outlining characteristics of geodesics around a Kerr black hole in Sec. II. We discuss the constants of motion, 4-velocities, and turning points associated with bound Kerr geodesics in II A and II B. In II C, we present a frequency-domain description of motion in a Kerr spacetime that is particularly useful in our examination of spinning-body orbits. In Sec. III, we move on to the equations of motion for a body when its spin couples to spacetime curvature. We focus on the leading order in spin limit that has the most relevance to the astrophysical systems we are studying in Sec. III C. In this limit, the spin vector is parallel transported along the worldline. Given this, we discuss parallel transport along Kerr geodesics in some detail in Sec. III D.\nWe begin our detailed study of bound spinning-body motion by examining several simple cases. In Sec. IV, we examine orbits which are circular and either equatorial or nearly equatorial, for which we can obtain closed form analytic solutions. This simple case allows us to establish the general principles of the framework we use throughout the paper, as well as to compare with previously known results. We present the circular, nearly equatorial case in detail and for general black hole spin. In Sec. V, we extend these circular cases by expanding in eccentricity in order to study slightly eccentric, nearly equatorial orbits. For general Kerr, we develop closedform solutions to first order in eccentricity. We also present these solutions to second order in eccentricity for the Schwarzschild limit.\nFinally, in Sec. VI, we use a frequency-domain treatment to compute orbits with arbitrary eccentricity and with the small body\u2019s spin arbitrarily oriented. The frequency-domain expansion allows us to examine orbits with arbitrary eccentricity, provided we include enough harmonics in our expansion. We calculate how the spincurvature coupling shifts the orbital frequencies \u2126r and \u2126\u03c6 from their geodesic expectations (using the fact that the parameterization for nearly equatorial spinning-body orbits is very similar to the parameterization of equatorial geodesic orbits), as well as how the coupling shifts the constants of motion ES , LSz and Q\nS . Section VII concludes with a summary of our results, and an outline of plans for future work that uses the orbits of spinning bodies. We also briefly remark on results we present in our companion paper [109], which describes how to extend this framework to model fully generic orbits (i.e., orbits of arbitrary eccentricity and inclination) with generic orientation of the small body\u2019s spin."

(2.2)\n(Here and throughout we use geometrized units, with G = 1 = c.)\nFour constants of motion characterize Kerr geodesics. The first is the rest mass \u00b5 of the orbiting body. It is determined by requiring p\u0302\u03b1 = \u00b5u\u0302\u03b1 (where p\u0302\u03b1 is the geodesic\u2019s 4-momentum, and u\u0302\u03b1 its 4-velocity; recall we use the hat accent to denote quantities defined along geodesics) and by requiring the norm of the 4-velocity to be \u22121. The Kerr metric (2.1) is independent of the coordinates t and \u03c6, implying that the spacetime possesses two Killing vectors \u03be\u03b1t and \u03be \u03b1 \u03c6 , corresponding to time translation and axial symmetries respectively. These Killing vectors yield two more constants of the motion, the energy per unit mass E\u0302 and axial angular momentum per unit mass L\u0302z:\nE\u0302 = \u2212\u03be\u03b1t u\u0302\u00b5 = \u2212u\u0302t , (2.3) L\u0302z = \u03be \u03b1 \u03c6 u\u0302\u00b5 = u\u0302\u03c6 . (2.4)\nNote that we have normalized these quantities by the mass \u00b5 of the orbiting body.\nThe Kerr metric also admits an anti-symmetric KillingYano tensor [121], given by [104]\nF\u00b5\u03bd = a cos \u03b8 ( e\u03041\u00b5e\u0304 0 \u03bd \u2212 e\u03040\u00b5e\u03041\u03bd ) + r ( e\u03042\u00b5e\u0304 3 \u03bd \u2212 e\u03043\u00b5e\u03042\u03bd ) , (2.5)\nwhere\ne\u03040\u00b5 =\n[\u221a \u2206\n\u03a3 , 0, 0,\u2212a sin2 \u03b8\n\u221a \u2206\n\u03a3\n] , (2.6)\ne\u03041\u00b5 =\n[ 0, \u221a \u03a3\n\u2206 , 0, 0\n] , (2.7)\ne\u03042\u00b5 = [ 0, 0, \u221a \u03a3, 0 ] , (2.8)\ne\u03043\u00b5 =\n[ \u2212a sin \u03b8\u221a\n\u03a3 , 0, 0,\n( r2 + a2 ) sin \u03b8\n\u221a \u03a3\n] . (2.9)\n5 This tensor has the defining property\n\u2207\u03b3F\u03b1\u03b2 +\u2207\u03b2F\u03b1\u03b3 = 0 . (2.10)\nLet us define the vector\nL\u0302\u03bd = F\u00b5\u03bd u\u0302\u00b5 . (2.11)\nWe will call this the orbital angular momentum 4-vector, since it has the dimensions of orbital angular momentum (per unit mass of the orbiting body), and reduces to the orbital angular momentum in the Schwarzschild limit.\nNotice that in Refs. [82] and [122], this vector is defined with the index contracted on the second index of F\u00b5\u03bd . Because of the Killing-Yano tensor\u2019s antisymmetry, this results in an overall sign difference. With the definition (2.11), equatorial orbits have L\u0302\u03b8 \u221d \u2212L\u0302z. This is a sensible correspondence, since (by right-hand rule) one expects the angular momentum of a prograde equatorial orbit (for which L\u0302z > 0) to point opposite to the direction of increasing polar angle \u03b8. We have found that this sign swap is needed to establish correspondence between our results and important examples of past literature. In particular, past work which examined equatorial orbits of bodies with spin aligned with the large black hole\u2019s spin and with the orbital angular momentum typically designate the small body\u2019s spin as pointing along the \u201cz direction.\u201d This correspondence requires the \u201cz direction\u201d (i.e., parallel to the large black hole\u2019s spin) to point in the direction of decreasing \u03b8 at the equatorial plane.\nFrom the antisymmetry of F\u00b5\u03bd we see that\nL\u0302\u00b5u\u0302\u00b5 = 0 . (2.12)\nFurther, using Eq. (2.10), it is straightforward to show that L\u0302\u00b5 is parallel-transported along geodesics:\nDL\u0302\u03b2\nd\u03c4 \u2261 u\u0302\u03b1\u2207\u03b1L\u0302\u03b2 = 0 . (2.13)\nIt is also not hard to show that the square of this vector\nK\u0302 = L\u0302\u00b5L\u0302\u00b5 (2.14)\nis conserved, i.e. that\nDK\u0302\nd\u03c4 \u2261 u\u0302\u03b1\u2207\u03b1K\u0302 = 0 . (2.15)\nCarter [123] first demonstrated the existence of a fourth conserved constant for Kerr geodesic motion. This constant arises from a Killing tensor K\u00b5\u03bd , which can be thought of as the \u201csquare\u201d of F\u00b5\u03bd ,\nK\u00b5\u03bd = F\u00b5\u03b1F\u03bd\u03b1 . (2.16)\nThe corresponding constant\nK\u0302 = K\u03b1\u03b2 u\u0302 \u03b1u\u0302\u03b2 (2.17)\nis identical to the K\u0302 defined in (2.14), and is usually called the \u201cCarter constant.\u201d For many analyses, it is\nparticularly convenient to combine K\u0302, E\u0302, and L\u0302z into a related conserved quantity Q\u0302 given by\nQ\u0302 = K\u0302 \u2212 ( L\u0302z \u2212 aE\u0302 )2 (2.18)\n= p\u03022\u03b8 + a 2 cos2 \u03b8\u0302\n( 1\u2212 E\u03022 ) + cot2 \u03b8\u0302 L\u03022z . (2.19)\nConfusingly, Q\u0302 is also often called the Carter constant; we will use both K\u0302 and Q\u0302 from time to time in our analysis. The constant Q\u0302 is particularly useful for discussing geodesics, so we focus on this version of the Carter constant in the remainder of this section.\nB. 4-velocities, turning points, and parameterization\nCarter first showed that the existence of these conserved quantities permits the geodesic equations to be separated in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates [123]. These separated equations are given by\n\u03a32 ( dr\u0302\nd\u03c4\n)2 = [E\u0302(r\u03022 + a2)\u2212 aL\u0302z]2\n\u2212\u2206[r\u03022 + (L\u0302z \u2212 aE\u0302)2 + Q\u0302] \u2261 R(r\u0302) , (2.20)\n\u03a32\n( d\u03b8\u0302\nd\u03c4\n)2 = Q\u0302\u2212 cot2 \u03b8\u0302L\u03022z \u2212 a2 cos2 \u03b8\u0302(1\u2212 E\u03022)\n\u2261 \u0398(\u03b8\u0302) , (2.21)\n\u03a3 d\u03c6\u0302\nd\u03c4 = csc2 \u03b8\u0302L\u0302z + aE\u0302\n( r\u03022 + a2 \u2206 \u2212 1 ) \u2212 a 2L\u0302z \u2206\n\u2261 \u03a6(r\u0302, \u03b8\u0302) , (2.22)\n\u03a3 dt\u0302\nd\u03c4 = E\u0302\n( (r\u03022 + a2)2\n\u2206 \u2212 a2 sin2 \u03b8\u0302 ) + aL\u0302z ( 1\u2212 r\u0302 2 + a2\n\u2206 ) \u2261 T (r\u0302, \u03b8\u0302) . (2.23)\nBecause these are evaluated strictly along geodesic orbits,\nwe parameterize them using the coordinates (r\u0302, \u03b8\u0302, \u03c6\u0302, t\u0302) of such an orbit. Equations (2.20) \u2013 (2.23) are parameterized using proper time \u03c4 along the orbit. As written, these equations are not completely separated: the factor \u03a3 = r\u03022 + a2 cos2 \u03b8\u0302 couples the radial and polar motions. By introducing a new time parameter \u03bb, commonly called \u201cMino time\u201d and defined by d\u03bb = d\u03c4/\u03a3 [124], the radial and polar equations of motion decouple, yielding(\ndr\u0302\nd\u03bb\n)2 = R(r\u0302) ,\n( d\u03b8\u0302\nd\u03bb\n)2 = \u0398(\u03b8\u0302) ,\nd\u03c6\u0302 d\u03bb = \u03a6(r\u0302, \u03b8\u0302) ,\ndt\u0302 d\u03bb = T (r\u0302, \u03b8\u0302) . (2.24)\n6 Mino-time \u03bb is a very convenient parameterization for describing the strong-field dynamics of Kerr black hole orbits. By using dt\u0302/d\u03bb, it is not difficult to convert from \u03bb to Boyer-Lindquist time t, which naturally describes quantities as measured by a distant observer.\nTo understand the turning points of bound geodesics and the parameterization that we use, begin by carefully\nexamining the functions R(r\u0302) and \u0398(\u03b8\u0302). For bound orbits, R(r\u0302) can be written\nR(r\u0302) = (1\u2212 E\u03022)(r1 \u2212 r\u0302)(r\u0302 \u2212 r2)(r\u0302 \u2212 r3)(r\u0302 \u2212 r4) , (2.25)\nwhere the roots are ordered such that r4 \u2264 r3 \u2264 r2 \u2264 r\u0302 \u2264 r1. The roots r1 and r2 are turning points of the motion. Likewise, \u0398(\u03b8\u0302) can be written\n\u0398(\u03b8\u0302) = a2\nsin2 \u03b8\u0302\n( 1\u2212 E\u03022 )( z+ \u2212 cos2 \u03b8\u0302 )( z\u2212 \u2212 cos2 \u03b8\u0302 ) ,\n(2.26)\nwhere we have introduced z\u0302 \u2261 cos2 \u03b8\u0302. These roots are ordered such that 0 \u2264 z\u2212 \u2264 1 \u2264 z+; turning points of the motion occur where z\u0302 = z\u2212. This occurs when \u03b8\u0302 = \u03b8\u2212 and \u03b8\u0302 = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8\u2212, defined by cos2 \u03b8\u2212 = z\u2212.\nBound geodesics are thus confined to a torus, bounded in radius by r2 \u2264 r\u0302 \u2264 r1 and in polar angle by \u03b8\u2212 \u2264 \u03b8\u0302 \u2264 (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8\u2212). We can build these bounds into the orbiting body\u2019s motion by defining\nr\u0302 = pM\n1 + e cos \u03c7\u0302r , (2.27)\ncos \u03b8\u0302 = sin I cos \u03c7\u0302\u03b8 . (2.28)\nThe angles \u03c7\u0302r and \u03c7\u0302\u03b8 are relativistic generalizations of the \u201ctrue anomaly\u201d angles often used in Newtonian orbital dynamics; these angles increase monotonically over an orbit. The parameters p and e are the orbit\u2019s semilatus rectum and eccentricity, respectively; in the Newtonian limit, they correspond to the equivalent parameters which define a Keplerian ellipse. By inspection, one can see that\nr1 = pM\n1\u2212 e , r2 =\npM\n1 + e . (2.29)\nThe angle I defines the inclination of the orbit; it is related to the angle \u03b8\u2212 according to\nI = \u03c0/2\u2212 sgn(L\u0302z)\u03b8\u2212 . (2.30)\nThis angle automatically encodes a notion of prograde (L\u0302z > 0, I < 90 \u25e6) and retrograde (L\u0302z < 0, I > 90 \u25e6) orbits. Equatorial orbits (\u03b8\u2212 = 90 \u25e6) have I = 0\u25e6 (prograde) or I = 180\u25e6 (retrograde). Up to initial conditions, an orbit can be specified by either the set of constants of the motion (E\u0302, L\u0302z, Q\u0302) or the quantities (p, e, I) which determine the orbit\u2019s geometry (being careful to choose values which do not go inside the \u201clast stable orbit,\u201d the locus of parameter\nspace inside which bound orbits are unstable and rapidly plunge into the black hole; see [125] for discussion). In this analysis, we use (p, e, I), and then use expressions given in Refs. [116, 122] (see also App. A of Ref. [126])\nto determine E\u0302, L\u0302z, and Q\u0302. Once these parameters are known, we can use closed-form expressions for the solutions to the geodesic equations (2.20\u20132.23), formulated in terms of elliptic functions [116]. We also use solutions for bound geodesic trajectories as functions of Mino-time, r\u0302(\u03bb) and z\u0302(\u03bb), using the simplified form given by van de Meent [122]. Formulae for computing geodesic trajectories are implemented in the KerrGeodesicsMathematica package of the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit (hereafter \u201cthe Toolkit\u201d) [127]."

[116], and coded into the KerrGeodesics package of the Toolkit [127].\nFrom these Mino-time expressions, we can find their Boyer-Lindquist coordinate-time analogues using a factor \u0393\u0302 which is the orbit-averaged factor relating an interval of Mino-time \u03bb to an element of coordinate time t. Let T\u0302x be the coordinate time orbital period for motion in coordinate x, and let \u2126\u0302x = 2\u03c0/T\u0302x be the corresponding frequency.

It\u2019s worth noting that the quanti-\nties \u03a5\u0302\u03c6 and \u0393\u0302 are orbit averages of the functions \u03a6(r\u0302, \u03b8\u0302) and T (r\u0302, \u03b8\u0302) defined in Eq.

(3.3)\nIncluding additional structure on the small body leads to more complicated equations of motion. For example, the\nsmall body\u2019s quadrupole moment couples to the gradient of curvature [132\u2013134] and introduces additional torque terms [135]. The Mathisson-Papapetrou equations represent the \u201cpole-dipole\u201d approximation, in which the small body is treated as a monopolar point mass supplemented with a dipolar spin.\nFor each spacetime Killing vector \u03be\u03b1 there is constant of motion along the spinning body\u2019s worldline given by\nC = p\u03b1\u03be\u03b1 \u2212 1\n2 S\u03b1\u03b2\u2207\u03b2\u03be\u03b1 .

This constraint is called the Spin Supplementary Condition (SSC), and can be regarded as fixing internal degrees of freedom associated with the extended structure of the small body. In the non-relativistic limit, the center of mass can be identified as the natural place for the worldline to pass through the extended body. However, the center of mass is observer dependent in relativistic dynamics. The role of the SSC is thus to select one of the infinite choices of worldlines passing through the small body. Since there is in general no natural choice for the worldline, the SSC is intrinsically arbitrary. Excellent discussion of the physical meaning of the SSC can be found in Ref. [136]; comparisons of different SSCs and investigation of their equivalence can be found in Refs. [137\u2013141].\nAn SSC commonly used in studies of gravitational wave sources is due to Tulczyjew [142], and is given by\np\u03b1S \u03b1\u03b2 = 0 . (3.7)\nUsing (3.7), we find the relationship between the fourvelocity and the four-momentum (3.3) is now given by\nu\u00b5 = M \u00b52\n( p\u00b5 + 2S\u00b5\u03bdR\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\u03c4p \u03c1S\u03c3\u03c4\n4\u00b52 +R\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4S\u03b1\u03b2S\u03b3\u03b4\n) , (3.8)\n8 where\n\u00b5 \u2261 \u221a \u2212p\u03b1p\u03b1 , (3.9) M\u2261 \u2212p\u03b1u\u03b1 . (3.10)\nThese relationships tell us that p\u03b1 = \u00b5u\u03b1 + O(S2), and \u00b5 =M+O(S2), a result we will exploit shortly.\nThe spin tensor is antisymmetric, which facilitates defining the spin vector [138]\nS\u00b5 = \u2212 1 2\u00b5 \u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2p\u03bdS \u03b1\u03b2 , (3.11)\nwhere\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 = \u221a \u2212g[\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4] (3.12)\nand where \u221a \u2212g is the metric determinant, reducing to \u03a3 sin \u03b8 for Kerr, and [\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4] is the totally antisymmetric symbol. By combining these results, one can show that the magnitude of the spin is another constant of the motion, given by\nS2 = S\u03b1S\u03b1 = 1\n2 S\u03b1\u03b2S\n\u03b1\u03b2 . (3.13)"

Linear-in-spin effects are thus effectively quadratic in the system\u2019s mass ratio, affecting a system\u2019s dynamics at the same formal order as important self force effects [31, 33, 35]. The next order in spin scales with the fourth power of the system\u2019s mass ratio, practically negligible at extreme mass ratios. A linear-in-spin analysis is thus formally interesting as well as of astrophysical relevance. As such, we focus on the linear-in-spin limit, neglecting terms in all of our equations that are O(S2) or higher.\nIn this limit, the Matthisson-Papapetrou equations (3.1) \u2013 (3.2) and the Tulczyjew SSC (3.7) take a particularly useful form. Revisiting various relations in Secs. III A and III B but dropping all terms beyond linear in S, the Tulczyjew SSC (3.7) becomes\np\u03b1 = \u00b5u\u03b1 .

(3.21)\nEquation (3.21) helps us understand the meaning of the SSC, at least in a linear-in-spin analysis: it tells us that in a freely-falling frame that moves with the geodesic whose 4-velocity is u\u0302\u03b1, the small body\u2019s spin is purely spatial.

            "text": "Since the small body\u2019s spin vector is parallel transported along its orbit, as described by Eq. (3.22), let us examine such parallel transport in detail. Past work [143] showed how to build a solution describing this transport using a frequency-domain expansion, demonstrating that an additional frequency emerges which characterizes the timescale associated with the spin\u2019s precession. Van de Meent [122] has since then produced an elegant closed-form tetrad-based solution for describing the parallel transport of vectors along Kerr geodesics, following methods first developed Marck [144\u2013146]; see also work by Bini and collaborators, which explores and clarifies the geometrical properties of Marck\u2019s procedure [132, 147, 148], as well as Mashoon and collaborators [61, 149]. Following Ref. [122], we summarize the procedure for constructing this tetrad and describe how to use it to describe a spinning body moving along its orbit.\nWe write the tetrad {e0\u03b1(\u03bb), e\u03031\u03b1(\u03bb), e\u03032\u03b1(\u03bb), e3\u03b1(\u03bb)}. Take its first leg, e0\u03b1(\u03bb), to be the geodesic\u2019s 4-velocity; take its last leg, e3\u03b1(\u03bb), to be the (normalized) orbital angular momentum 4-vector defined in Eq. (2.11). Our tetrad so far consists of the vectors\ne0\u03b1(\u03bb) = u\u0302\u03b1(\u03bb) , e3\u03b1(\u03bb) = 1\u221a K\u0302 L\u0302\u03b1(\u03bb) , (3.23)\n9 where L\u0302\u03b1(\u03bb) is the orbital angular momentum 4-vector along the geodesic with 4-velocity u\u0302\u03b1(\u03bb). By the properties of u\u0302\u03b1(\u03bb), L\u0302\u03b1(\u03bb), and K\u0302, these tetrad legs are orthogonal to each other and parallel transported along u\u0302\u03b1(\u03bb). We then construct e\u03031\u03b1(\u03bb) and e\u03032\u03b1(\u03bb) by choosing two vectors which lie in the plane orthogonal to e0\u03b1(\u03bb) and e3\u03b1(\u03bb); see Ref. [122], Eqs. (50) and (51), for explicit formulas.\nThe resulting tetrad is in general not parallel transported. However, by defining\ne1\u03b1(\u03bb) = cos\u03c8p(\u03bb) e\u03031\u03b1(\u03bb) + sin\u03c8p(\u03bb) e\u03032\u03b1(\u03bb) (3.24) e2\u03b1(\u03bb) = \u2212 sin\u03c8p(\u03bb) e\u03031\u03b1(\u03bb) + cos\u03c8p(\u03bb) e\u03032\u03b1(\u03bb) (3.25)\nand requiring that the precession phase \u03c8p(\u03bb) satisfies\nd\u03c8p d\u03bb\n= \u221a K\u0302 ( (r2 + a2)E\u0302 \u2212 aL\u0302z\nK\u0302 + r2 + a L\u0302z \u2212 a(1\u2212 z2)E\u0302 K\u0302 \u2212 a2z2 ) (3.26)\nwe obtain a tetrad {e0\u03b1(\u03bb), e1\u03b1(\u03bb), e2\u03b1(\u03bb), e3\u03b1(\u03bb)} that is parallel transported along the geodesic [122, 144, 145]. Van de Meent further finds a closed form solution to Eq. (3.26) of the form\n\u03c8p(\u03bb) = \u03a5s\u03bb+ \u03c8r(\u03a5\u0302r\u03bb) + \u03c8\u03b8(\u03a5\u0302\u03b8\u03bb) , (3.27)\nwhere \u03a5s (denoted \u03a5\u03c8 in Ref. [122]) is the frequency (conjugate to Mino-time) describing the precession of\nthis tetrad along the orbit; the functions \u03c8r(\u03a5\u0302r\u03bb) and \u03c8\u03b8(\u03a5\u0302\u03b8\u03bb) are phases associated with the orbit\u2019s radial and polar motions. We define the Mino-time precession period as \u039bs = 2\u03c0/\u03a5s.\nThis solution makes setting the spin of the small body easy: We write the small body\u2019s spin vector\nS\u03b1 = S 0e0\u03b1(\u03bb) + S 1e1\u03b1(\u03bb) + S 2e2\u03b1(\u03bb) + S 3e3\u03b1(\u03bb) , (3.28) where {S0, S1, S2, S3} are all constants with the dimension of angular momentum. The requirement that u\u0302\u03b1S\u03b1 = 0 means that S\n0 = 0 for all configurations. A component S3 \u2261 S\u2016 denotes a component of the small body\u2019s spin parallel or antiparallel to the orbital angular momentum, normal to the orbital plane; S1 and S2 define components perpendicular to the orbital angular momentum, in the orbital plane. A spin vector with S1 = S2 = 0 does not precess, and so its motion has no frequency components at harmonics of the spin-precession frequency \u03a5s. By contrast, when S\n1 or S2 are non-zero, the small body\u2019s spin precesses over an orbit, and harmonics of the frequency \u03a5s appear in a frequency-domain description of the small body\u2019s orbit.\nCode for computing these tetrad legs is implemented as part of the KerrGeodesics package in the Toolkit [127]."

For the configurations that we study, the spin is a small parameter,\nand these trajectories can be regarded as perturbative deviations from bound Kerr geodesics. We discuss the nature of an orbit\u2019s \u201cspin shift\u201d in detail later as we analyze specific orbit and spin configurations. In general, the small body\u2019s trajectory can be written in the form\nx\u03b1(\u03bb) = x\u0302\u03b1(\u03bb) + \u03b4x\u03b1S(\u03bb) , (3.29)\nwhere x\u0302\u03b1(\u03bb) is the coordinate-space trajectory of an appropriately chosen geodesic, and \u03b4x\u03b1S(\u03bb) is the O(S) shift due to the spin. Similarly, we write the small body\u2019s 4- velocity\nu\u03b1 = u\u0302\u03b1 + u\u03b1S , (3.30)\nwhere u\u0302\u03b1 solves the geodesic equation, and u\u03b1S = O(S). One important point to note is that x\u0302\u03b1(\u03bb) will in general have different periods than x\u03b1(\u03bb): the periods \u039br,\u03b8,\u03c6 which characterize bound orbits of spinning bodies differ from the geodesic periods \u039b\u0302r,\u03b8,\u03c6 by O(S). As such, a naive definition of \u03b4x\u03b1S necessarily contain unbounded, secularly growing terms. Such terms ruin the perturbative expansion that we use.\nAs such, we do not use the explicit form Eq. (3.29) directly when we compute spinning-body orbits in Secs. V and VI. We instead characterize these orbits using amplitude-phase variables. Doing so, the frequency shift is incorporated into the parameterization; see Eq. (5.16) or (6.4) and nearby text. Once we have solved for the frequency shift and phase variables, we can then compute \u03b4x\u03b1S . These quantities are particularly useful for finding the concomitant \u201cspin shifts\u201d to constants of motion, which we describe below. In Appendix A, we provide the explicit form of \u03b4x\u03b1S in terms of variables that we use in this work, as well as further discussion of the secular terms.\nAs the orbit evolves, we must preserve the norm of its 4-velocity. Using Eq. (3.30), demanding that u\u0302\u03b1u\u0302\u03b1 = \u22121, and enforcing u\u03b1u\u03b1 = \u22121 yields the constraint\nu\u0302\u03b1uS\u03b1 + u\u0302\u03b1u \u03b1 S = 0 . (3.31)\nWriting u\u03b1 = g\u03b1\u03b2u \u03b2 , and noting that g\u03b1\u03b2 is evaluated along the spinning-body orbits for which r = r\u0302+\u03b4rS and \u03b8 = \u03b8\u0302 + \u03b4\u03d1S , the spin-corrected covariant 4-velocity has the form\nuS\u03b1 = g\u03b1\u03b2u \u03b2 S + \u03b4rS\u2202rg\u03b1\u03b2 u\u0302 \u03b2 + \u03b4\u03b8S\u2202\u03b8g\u03b1\u03b2 u\u0302 \u03b2 . (3.32)\nThis allows us to write constraint (3.31) entirely in terms of the contravariant spin-correction to the 4-velocity, viz.,\n2g\u03b1\u03b2 u\u0302 \u03b1u\u03b2S+\u03b4rS\u2202rg\u03b1\u03b2 u\u0302 \u03b1u\u0302\u03b2+\u03b4\u03b8S\u2202\u03b8g\u03b1\u03b2 u\u0302 \u03b1u\u0302\u03b2 = 0 .

We also define the leading order in spin corrections to the energy \u03b4ES and axial angular momentum \u03b4LSz due to the spin using (3.5) and (3.6):\nES = E\u0302 + \u03b4ES , (3.34)\nLSz = L\u0302z + \u03b4L S z .

Normalizing by the orbiting body\u2019s rest mass squared, it is given by [135]\nKS = K\u03b1\u03b2u \u03b1u\u03b2 + \u03b4CS , (3.36)\nwhere\n\u03b4CS = \u2212 2 \u00b5 u\u0302\u00b5S\u03c1\u03c3 (F\u03bd\u03c3\u2207\u03bdF\u00b5\u03c1 \u2212F\u00b5\u03bd\u2207\u03bdF\u03c1\u03c3) . (3.37)\nWe define the first order in spin correction to K by\nKS = K\u0302 + \u03b4KS , (3.38)\nwhere K\u0302 is the Carter constant along the geodesic whose 4-velocity is u\u0302\u03b1, and \u03b4KS is O(S). Combining Eqs. (3.29), (3.30) and (3.36) with the definition (3.38) and truncating at linear order in S, we find\n\u03b4KS = 2K\u03b1\u03b2 u\u0302 \u03b1u\u03b2S + \u03b4rS\u2202rK\u03b1\u03b2 u\u0302 \u03b1u\u0302\u03b2 + \u03b4\u03b8S\u2202\u03b8K\u03b1\u03b2 u\u0302 \u03b1u\u0302\u03b2\n+ \u03b4CS . (3.39)\nThe first line of Eq. (3.39) includes two terms which are due to the shift of the small body\u2019s orbit that we find when examining spinning-body orbits. Applying Eq. (2.18), we then find the first-order shift in Q:\n\u03b4QS = \u03b4KS \u2212 2(L\u0302z \u2212 aE\u0302)(\u03b4LSz \u2212 a\u03b4ES) . (3.40)\nFor nearly equatorial orbits with polar motion defined by \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 + \u03b4\u03d1S in Eq. (1.4), \u03b4\u03d1S and \u03b4\u03b8S may be used interchangeably (which we do throughout this paper). However, in general, \u03b4\u03d1S corresponds only to the corrections to the libration region of the polar motion, while \u03b4\u03b8S denotes the entire spin-perturbation associated with \u03b8, as defined in Eq. (3.29). This distinction becomes important in our companion study [109],"

            "text": "In the remainder of this paper, we examine several examples of the orbits of spinning bodies about Kerr black holes. Before exploring these specific cases in detail, we briefly lay out and summarize general characteristics of the orbits that we find.\nConsider first an orbit that would be equatorial if the orbiting body were non-spinning. If this body\u2019s spin is normal to the equatorial plane (i.e., parallel or antiparallel to both the orbital angular momentum and the large black hole\u2019s spin), then its orbit is quite simple. Just as in the geodesic case, we can use the parameterization r = pM/(1 + e cos\u03c7r). The radial turning points are fixed for the duration of the orbit at pM/(1 \u00b1 e), and the orbit\u2019s dynamics maps onto a true anomaly angle \u03c7r. This true anomaly differs from the true anomaly that describes geodesics, \u03c7\u0302r; details of this difference are presented in Sec. V. The orbit\u2019s radial frequency is shifted\ncompared to the geodesic by an amount O(S); we write the radial frequency \u03a5r = \u03a5\u0302r + \u03a5 S r . This case is discussed in quantitative detail in Secs. V C and VI A, with the special case of circular equatorial orbits presented in Sec. IV A.\nConsider next such an orbit but with the spin misaligned with respect to the orbital plane. This misalignment introduces O(S) oscillations centered about the equatorial plane: The polar motion acquires a correction \u03b4\u03d1S whose Fourier expansion is at harmonics of the spin frequency \u03a5s and the radial frequency \u03a5r = \u03a5\u0302r + \u03a5 S r . The radial motion, however, remains exactly as it was in the spin-aligned case. We discuss this case in detail in Secs. V B and VI B; an explicit analytic solution for circular, nearly equatorial motion is calculated in Sec. IV B.\nWe focus on these equatorial and nearly equatorial cases in this paper. For orbits that are not \u201cnearly equatorial\u201d, the parameterization becomes rather more complicated. In particular, the \u201cgeodesic-like\u201d parameterization of the nearly equatorial case must be modified, adding a spin-induced contribution to the orbit\u2019s libration region in both the radial and polar motions. This holds even if the spin-vector is aligned with the orbital angular momentum. We discuss these more complicated cases in a companion paper [109]."

These cases allow us to introduce the main principles we use to describe and parameterize our solutions, and provide limiting examples which can be compared against other results in the literature. We begin with the simplest possible orbit: a circular orbit of radius r, confined to the equatorial plane (I = 0\u25e6 or I = 180\u25e6).\nMany of the results we find are derived in Ref. [104], which focuses on circular orbits of spinning bodies, as well as elsewhere in the literature. The results we present in Sec.

The small body\u2019s spin is parallel to the orbit if s\u2016 > 0, and antiparallel if\n11\ns\u2016 < 0. The geodesic integrals of motion are\nE\u0302 = 1\u2212 2v2 \u00b1 qv3\u221a 1\u2212 3v2 \u00b1 2qv3 , (4.1)\nL\u0302z = \u00b1 \u221a rM 1\u2213 2qv3 + q2v4\u221a 1\u2212 3v2 \u00b1 2qv3 , (4.2)\nQ\u0302 = 0 . (4.3)\nWe have introduced v = \u221a M/r (equivalently r = M/v2) and q = a/M . Where there is a choice, the upper sign is for prograde orbits (I = 0\u25e6) and the lower is for retrograde (I = 180\u25e6). The small body\u2019s background 4- velocity is given by u\u0302\u03b1 = (\u2212E\u0302, 0, 0, L\u0302z).\nThe small body\u2019s spin 4-vector is given by\nS\u03b1 = s\u2016\u00b5 2e3\u03b1 = (0, 0,\u2213rs\u2016\u00b52, 0) . (4.4)\nThis result comes from the fact that for an equatorial circular orbit [122],\ne3\u03b1 =\n( 0, 0,\u2212r (L\u0302z \u2212 aE\u0302)\n|L\u0302z \u2212 aE\u0302| , 0 ) = (0, 0,\u2213r, 0) . (4.5)\nIf the orbit is prograde and s\u2016 > 0, or the orbit is retrograde and s\u2016 < 0, then the small body\u2019s spin points in the direction of decreasing \u03b8; vice versa if s\u2016 and the orbit have the opposite signs and orientations.\nLet us examine (3.16) for this case. Using Eq. (3.30),\nwe start by expanding the covariant derivative:\nDu\u03b1\nd\u03c4 = (u\u0302\u03b2 + u\u03b2S)\u2207\u03b2 (u\u0302 \u03b1 + u\u03b1S)\n= du\u0302\u03b1 d\u03c4 + du\u03b1S d\u03c4 + \u0393\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 u\u0302 \u03b2 u\u0302\u03b3 + 2\u0393\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 u\u0302 \u03b2u\u03b3S +O(S 2) = du\u03b1S d\u03c4 + 2\u0393\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 u\u0302 \u03b2u\u03b3S . (4.6)\nHere, \u0393\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 is the Christoffel connection for the Kerr geometry evaluated along the orbit. In going from the second line to the third line, we used the fact that u\u0302\u03b1 solves the geodesic equation, and we linearized in S. We also used the fact that, for this orbit, the spinning body remains confined to the equatorial plane \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 at radius r. For the misaligned case we consider next, the orbit oscillates in the polar direction, and there is a correction term that involves \u2202\u03b8\u0393 \u03b1 \u03b2\u03b3 .\nRequiring the spinning body\u2019s orbit to be circular and equatorial means that\nurS = u \u03b8 S = 0 . (4.7)\nFurther, the requirement that u\u03b1S u\u0302\u03b1 = 0 tells us that\nutS = L\u0302z\nE\u0302 u\u03c6S . (4.8)\nThe only unique component we must determine is thus u\u03c6S . Note that we must have du \u03c6 S/d\u03c4 = 0. If we observe the system in a frame that co-rotates with the orbit, it appears static; the symmetries of the spin-curvature coupling in this case do not introduce any dynamics.\nCombining Eqs. (3.22) and (4.6) with urS = u \u03b8 S = 0 = du\u03c6S/d\u03c4 , we find the equation which governs the spin correction to the small body\u2019s orbital velocity is given by\n2\u0393r\u03b2\u03b3 u\u0302 \u03b2u\u03b3S = \u2212\n1\n2\u00b5 Rr\u03bd\u03bb\u03c3u\u0302 \u03bdS\u03bb\u03c3 ; (4.9)\nall other components of this equation vanish. Expanding the right-hand and left-hand sides of (4.9), we find\n2\u0393r\u03b2\u03b3 u\u0302 \u03b2u\u03b3S = \u2213\n2v \u221a\n1\u2212 3v2 \u00b1 2qv3(1\u2212 2v2 + q2v4)u\u03c6S 1\u2212 2v2 \u00b1 qv3 , (4.10)\n\u2212 1 2\u00b5 Rr\u03bd\u03bb\u03c3u\u0302 \u03bdS\u03bb\u03c3 = 3s\u2016\u00b5 M2 v7(1\u2213 qv)(1\u2212 2v2 + q2v4) 1\u2212 3v2 \u00b1 2qv3 . (4.11)\nUsing this to evaluate Eq. (4.9) yields\nu\u03c6S = \u2213 3s\u2016\u00b5 2M2 v6(1\u2213 qv)(1\u2212 2v2 \u00b1 qv3) (1\u2212 3v2 \u00b1 2qv3)3/2 . (4.12)\nUsing Eq. (4.8), this in turn yields a simple result for utS . An observationally important aspect of this solution is\nits influence on the system\u2019s orbital frequency. Using\n\u2126\u03c6 = u\u03c6 ut = u\u0302\u03c6 + u\u03c6S u\u0302t + utS , (4.13)\nexpanding in S, using \u2126\u0302\u03c6 = u\u0302 \u03c6/u\u0302t, and finally defining \u2126\u03c6 = \u2126\u0302\u03c6 + \u03b4\u2126\u03c6, we find the correction to the frequency\n12\ndue to the spin-curvature force:\n\u03b4\u2126\u03c6 = \u2126\u0302\u03c6 ( u\u03c6S u\u0302\u03c6 \u2212 u t S\nu\u0302tS\n) . (4.14)\nFor circular and equatorial orbits,\n\u2126\u0302\u03c6 = \u00b1 v3\nM(1\u00b1 qv3) . (4.15)\nCombining these various results, we find the shift to the axial frequency:\n\u03b4\u2126\u03c6 = \u2213 3s\u2016\n2M\n\u00b5\nM (1\u2213 qv) (1\u00b1 qv3)2 v6 . (4.16)\nThis agrees exactly with Eq. (4.26) in Ref. [104]. The orbiting body\u2019s energy, axial angular momentum, and Carter constant are also shifted. Combining Eqs. (3.5), (3.6), (3.34), and (3.35) with the results in this section and using Eqs. (3.39) and (3.40), we find\n\u03b4ES = \u2212 s\u2016\n2\n\u00b5\nM (1\u2213 qv)(1\u2213 4q3 + 3q2v4) (1\u2212 3v2 \u00b1 2qv3)3/2 v5 , (4.17)\n\u03b4LSz = \u00b1 s\u2016\u00b5\n2\n(2\u2212 13v2 + 18v4)\u00b1 3q(3\u2212 7v2)v3 + 2q2(1 + 2v2)v6 \u00b1 q3(3\u2212 7v2)v7 + 3q4v10\n(1\u2212 3v2 \u00b1 2qv3)3/2 , (4.18)\n\u03b4KS = s\u2016\u00b5 (2\u2212 13v2 + 18v4)\u2213 2qv(2\u2212 17v2 + 28v4)\u2212 q2v4(17\u2212 45v2)\u2213 6q3v7 \u2212 3q4v8\nv(1\u2212 3v2 \u00b1 2qv3)2 , (4.19)\n\u03b4QS = \u22132s\u2016\u00b5a . (4.20)\nThese expressions for the conserved quantities \u03b4ES and \u03b4LSz match exactly with Eqs. (B9) and (B10) derived using the alternative approach outlined in Appendix B. It is interesting that there is a non-zero \u03b4QS even though there is no change to the polar motion of the small body in this case. We note that Witzany has provided a modified definition of \u03b4QS (see text near Eq. (48) of Ref. [82]) such that it is zero for cases in which there is no polar motion; we are likely to adopt this definition in future work. In any case, our result agrees with that reported in Ref. [104], after translating the somewhat different notation."

(4.21)\nWe have broken the spin into a component parallel to the orbit (out of the orbital plane) with magnitude s\u2016, and into components normal to the orbit (in the orbital plane) with magnitude s\u22a5. The angle \u03c6s describes the orientation of the spin components normal to the orbit.\nSetting s = \u221a s2\u22a5 + s 2 \u2016, we require 0 \u2264 s \u2264 1.\nUsing (3.24) and (3.25), Eq.

The tetrad leg e3\u03b1 is the same as in Sec. IV A. Continuing to use the parameterization q \u2261 a/M , v = \u221a M/r, the tetrad legs e\u03031\u03b1 and e\u03032\u03b1 are given by\ne\u03031\u03b1 =\n( 0,\n1\u221a 1\u2212 2v2 + a2v4 , 0, 0\n) , (4.23)\ne\u03032\u03b1 =\n( v \u221a 1\u2212 2v2 + q2v4 1\u2212 3v2 \u00b1 2qv3 , 0, 0,\u2213r(1\u00b1 qv3) \u221a 1\u2212 2v2 + q2v4 1\u2212 3v2 \u00b1 2qv3 ) . (4.24)\nFor circular and equatorial orbits, the precession phase \u03c8p can be written as functions of Mino-time \u03bb, proper\n13\ntime \u03c4 , or Boyer-Lindquist time t:\n\u03c8p = \u03a5s\u03bb = \u03c9s\u03c4 = \u2126st , (4.25)\nwith\n\u03a5s = \u221a rM = M/v , \u03c9s = \u221a M/r3 = v3/M ,\n\u2126s = \u03c9s\n\u221a 1\u2212 3v2 \u00b1 2qv3\n(1\u00b1 qv3) . (4.26)\nThis limiting form for \u03a5s was found in Ref. [143], and is confirmed by the general expression derived in Ref. [122]. The factor \u03a3 which converts from Mino-time frequencies to proper-time frequencies takes the constant value r2 for circular and equatorial orbits; likewise, the factor\n\u0393 = r2 1\u00b1 qv3\u221a\n1\u2212 3v2 \u00b1 2qv3 (4.27)\nwhich converts between Mino-time frequencies and coordinate-time quantities is constant for circular and equatorial orbits.\nTo proceed, we again examine Eq.

Expanding the covariant derivative yields a slightly different result as compared to what we found in the aligned case:\nDu\u03b1\nd\u03c4 = (u\u0302\u03b2 + u\u03b2S)\u2207\u03b2 (u\u0302 \u03b1 + u\u03b1S)\n= du\u0302\u03b1 d\u03c4 + du\u03b1S d\u03c4 + \u0393\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 u\u0302 \u03b2 u\u0302\u03b3 + \u03b4\u03d1S\u2202\u03b8\u0393 \u03b1 \u03b2\u03b3 u\u0302 \u03b2 u\u0302\u03b3\n+ 2\u0393\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 u\u0302 \u03b2u\u03b3S +O(S 2)\n= du\u03b1S d\u03c4 + \u03b4\u03d1S\u2202\u03b8\u0393 \u03b1 \u03b2\u03b3 u\u0302 \u03b2 u\u0302\u03b3 + 2\u0393\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 u\u0302 \u03b2u\u03b3S . (4.28)\nThe misaligned spin causes the small body to oscillate about the equatorial plane by \u03b4\u03d1S . This shifts the connection term at O(S), leading to the term in \u2202\u03b8\u0393\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 .\nExpanding the covariant derivatives and Riemann components of Eq. (3.16) for this case, making use of Eq. (4.28) we find\ndurS d\u03c4 \u00b1 2v(1\u2212 2v\n2 + q2v4) \u221a\n1\u2212 3v2 \u00b1 2qv3 1\u2212 2v2 \u00b1 qv3 u\u03c6S = 3s\u2016\u00b5 M2 v7(1\u2213 qv)(1\u2212 2v2 + q2v4) 1\u2212 3v2 \u00b1 2qv3 , (4.29)\ndu\u03c6S d\u03c4 + 2v5(1\u2212 2v2 \u00b1 qv3) M2(1\u2212 2v2 + q2v4) \u221a 1\u2212 3v2 \u00b1 2qv3 urS = 0 , (4.30)\nfor the equations governing urS and u \u03c6 S . Notice that these equations do not couple to the precessing orbit\u2019s polar motion. Notice also that since u\u0302r = u\u0302\u03b8 = 0, Eq. (4.8) holds for the misaligned case, and we do not need a separate equation governing utS .\nWe require the orbit to remain circular, so we put urS = 0 = durS/d\u03c4 . This allows us to immediately solve Eq. (4.29):\nu\u03c6S = \u2213 3s\u2016\u00b5 2M2 v6(1\u2213 qv)(1\u2212 2v2 \u00b1 qv3) (1\u2212 3v2 \u00b1 2qv3)3/2 . (4.31)\nSince this does not vary with time, Eq. (4.30) is also sat-\nisfied. Equation (4.31) is identical to the result we found in the spin-aligned case, Eq. (4.12). Our solution for utS is likewise identical to its aligned counterpart. From this it follows that Eq. (4.16) describes the change to the orbital frequency in this case as well.\nThe polar motion for this misaligned case requires more attention. As stated above, we put \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 + \u03b4\u03d1S , where \u03b4\u03d1S denotes the spin-induced polar motion about the equatorial plane. Because u\u0302\u03b8 = 0, we put u\u03b8 = u\u03b8S = d\u03b4\u03d1S/d\u03c4 . The polar component of Eq. (3.16) thus becomes\nd2\u03b4\u03d1S d\u03c42 + v6 M2 (1\u2213 4qv3 + 3q2v4) (1\u2212 3v2 \u00b1 2qv3) \u03b4\u03d1S = \u2212 3s\u22a5\u00b5 M3 v9(1\u2213 qv)\n\u221a 1\u2212 2v2 + q2v4\n1\u2212 3v2 \u00b1 2qv3 cos(\u03c6s + \u03c8p) . (4.32)\nThe coefficient of \u03b4\u03d1S on the left-hand side of Eq. (4.32) is the square of the polar proper-time frequency for circular equatorial geodesic orbits, which we denote \u03c9\u03b8. The solution to Eq. (4.32) has the form\n\u03b4\u03d1S = A(\u03c4) sin(\u03c9\u03b8\u03c4) +B(\u03c4) cos(\u03c9\u03b8\u03c4) , (4.33)\nwhere\n\u03c9\u03b8 = v3\nM \u221a 1\u2213 4qv3 + 3q2v4 1\u2212 3v2 \u00b1 2qv3 , (4.34)\n14\nand where A(\u03c4) and B(\u03c4) are given by\nA(\u03c4) = c1 \u2212 3s\u22a5\u00b5 2M2 v6(1\u2213 qv)\u221a\n1\u2212 3v2 \u00b1 2qv3\n\u221a 1\u2212 2v2 + q2v4\n1\u2213 4qv3 + 3q2v4\n[ sin(\u03c6s + (\u03c9s \u2212 \u03c9\u03b8)\u03c4)\n\u03c9s \u2212 \u03c9\u03b8 +\nsin(\u03c6s + (\u03c9s + \u03c9\u03b8)\u03c4)\n\u03c9s + \u03c9\u03b8\n] , (4.35)\nB(\u03c4) = c2 + 3s\u22a5\u00b5 2M2 v6(1\u2213 qv)\u221a\n1\u2212 3v2 \u00b1 2qv3\n\u221a 1\u2212 2v2 + q2v4\n1\u2213 4qv3 + 3q2v4\n[ cos(\u03c6s + (\u03c9s \u2212 \u03c9\u03b8)\u03c4)\n\u03c9s \u2212 \u03c9\u03b8 \u2212 cos(\u03c6s + (\u03c9s + \u03c9\u03b8)\u03c4) \u03c9s + \u03c9\u03b8\n] . (4.36)\nThe constants c1 and c2 must be determined by matching to the initial conditions \u03b4\u03d1S |\u03c4=0 and u\u03b8S |\u03c4=0. The precession of the small body\u2019s spin as it orbits the black hole causes the orbital plane to likewise precess. Note that the frequency combination \u03c9s\u2212\u03c9\u03b8 never passes through zero anywhere over the domain of allowed orbits. As such, the functions A(\u03c4) and B(\u03c4) defined in Eqs. (4.35) and (4.36) are well behaved everywhere.\nThe changes to the integrals of motion we find are identical to those in the aligned case, Eqs. (4.17) \u2013 (4.20). The fact that the changes \u03b4ES and \u03b4LSz are identical is consistent with other patterns that this analysis uncovered. However, the fact that \u03b4QS is identical \u2014 in particular, that \u03b4QS is insensitive to s\u22a5 \u2014 is somewhat surprising, since the small body does in fact move in the polar direction when the spin and orbit are misaligned. The precession of the smaller body\u2019s spin nonetheless keeps the orbit equatorial on average, which appears to be sufficient for Q to take its equatorial value. This again is consistent with results found in Ref. [104]."

            "text": "Slightly eccentric equatorial orbits are simple enough that, by expanding in both eccentricity e and spin s, we can develop and present mostly closed-form results for this case. In our discussion below, we show leading-order results, O(e, s), for orbits of bodies with general spin orientation in the Kerr spacetime. We go to higher order, O(e2, s) for Schwarzschild only, confining ourselves to the case of small body spin aligned with the orbit. Though no issue of principle prevents us from developing a more generic analysis at higher order, the formulas describing Kerr orbits become cumbersome as we go to higher order in e. As we will see below, our leading-order analysis is sufficient for us to understand the impact of misaligned spin on spinning-body orbital dynamics.\nThe results in the aligned spin section, Sec. V C, can be obtained using an alternative method we describe in Appendix B. This method is discussed in Refs. [64\u201366], and involves using conserved quantities ES , LSz , \u00b5\n2 and S2 to develop an effective potential for the radial motion."

This switch is not necessary for equatorial or nearly equatorial orbits, but will be necessary for the generic cases that we study in a companion paper. Using this parameterization now allows us to set up the calculation in this framework, and to examine the form of the solutions which emerge in this relatively simple limit.\nThe governing equation for the orbits is Eq. (3.16), which we repeat here and use to define the spin-curvature force f\u03b1S :\nDu\u03b1\nd\u03c4 = \u2212 1 2\u00b5 R\u03b1\u03bd\u03bb\u03c3u \u03bdS\u03bb\u03c3 \u2261 f\u03b1S /\u00b5 . (5.1)\nExpanding the covariant derivative, this becomes\ndu\u03b1\nd\u03c4 + \u0393\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3u \u03b2u\u03b3 = f\u03b1S /\u00b5 , (5.2)\nwhere \u0393\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 is the Christoffel connection for the Kerr spacetime, evaluated along the orbit.\nLet us define\nU\u03b1 \u2261 dx \u03b1\nd\u03bb = \u03a3u\u03b1 ; (5.3)\nthis follows from u\u03b1 = dx\u03b1/d\u03c4 , as well as the definition of Mino-time: d/d\u03bb = \u03a3d/d\u03c4 . From (5.3), it follows that\ndu\u03b1\nd\u03bb =\n1\n\u03a3\ndU\u03b1\nd\u03bb \u2212 U\n\u03b1\n\u03a32 d\u03a3 d\u03bb . (5.4)\nNext multiply (5.2) by \u03a32. Doing so and using Eq. (5.4), we put the equation which governs spinning-body orbits into the form\ndU\u03b1\nd\u03bb \u2212 U\n\u03b1\n\u03a3\nd\u03a3 d\u03bb + \u0393\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3U \u03b2U\u03b3 = \u03a32f\u03b1/\u00b5 . (5.5)\nNote that in general,\nd\u03a3 d\u03bb = 2r Ur \u2212 2a2 cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8 U\u03b8 . (5.6)\nFor the equatorial and nearly equatorial orbits which are our focus in this section, the second term in (5.6) is O(S2), which we neglect. The factor (1/\u03a3)d\u03a3/d\u03bb in Eq. (5.5) becomes 2Ur/r.\n15\nFor misaligned orbits, the orbiting body oscillates about the equatorial plane, just as we discussed for the circular misaligned case in Sec. IV B. Setting the polar angle to \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 + \u03b4\u03d1S , with \u03b4\u03d1S = O(S), the connection term in Eq. (5.5) becomes\n\u0393\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3U \u03b2U\u03b3 = (\u0393\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3)\u03b8=\u03c0/2 U \u03b2U\u03b3\n+ \u03b4\u03d1S (\u2202\u03b8\u0393 \u03b1 \u03b2\u03b3)\u03b8=\u03c0/2 U\u0302 \u03b2U\u0302\u03b3 . (5.7)\nNotice that it is the geodesic 4-velocity U\u0302\u03b2 that appears in the term with the derivative of the connection. Because \u03b4\u03d1S is itself O(S), contributions from the nongeodesic parts of U\u03b2 enter this term at O(S2) or higher.\nLet us write the small body\u2019s spin in the form\nS\u03b1 = \u00b5 2 [ s\u22a5 ( cos(\u03c6s + \u03c8p)e\u03031\u03b1 + sin(\u03c6s + \u03c8p)e\u03032\u03b1 ) + s\u2016e3\u03b1 ] , (5.8)\n= ( s\u22a5\u00b5 2\u03c3t, s\u22a5\u00b5 2\u03c3r,\u2213s\u2016\u00b52r, s\u22a5\u00b52\u03c3\u03c6 ) . (5.9)\nBoth the precession phase \u03c8p and the tetrad elements e\u03031\u03b1 and e\u03032\u03b1 are more complicated than they were in the circular limit; we defer discussion of their detailed forms until they are needed later in our analysis. The form (5.9) is a useful rewriting of (5.8); the components \u03c3t,r,\u03c6 can be read out of e\u03031\u03b1 and e\u03032\u03b1.\nWith everything in place, it is now not difficult to evaluate all the terms appearing in Eq. (5.5) and write out the equations governing the small body\u2019s 4-velocity U\u03b1. First, we write out the equations for Ur, U t and U\u03c6.\ndU t\nd\u03bb \u2212\n2Ur [( r3 \u2212 3Mr2 + a2(r \u2212M) ) Ur + aM(3r2 + a2)U\u03c6 ] r2\u2206 = 3s\u2016\u00b5(L\u0302z \u2212 aE\u0302)M(r2 + a2)U\u0302r r2\u2206 , (5.10)\ndUr\nd\u03bb +\n\u2206 [ M(U t \u2212 aU\u03c6)2 \u2212 r3(U\u03c6)2 ] r4 \u2212 (2r 2 \u2212 3Mr \u2212 a2)(Ur)2 r\u2206 = 3s\u2016\u00b5(L\u0302z \u2212 aE\u0302)M [ E\u0302(r2 + a2)\u2212 aL\u0302z ] r2 , (5.11)\ndU\u03c6\nd\u03bb +\n2Ur [ aMUr + (r3 \u2212 2Mr2 \u2212 a2M)U\u03c6 ] r2\u2206 = 3as\u2016\u00b5(L\u0302z \u2212 aE\u0302)MU\u0302r r2\u2206 . (5.12)\nNo term involving \u03b4\u03d1S enters these equations at O(S). Indeed, note that the equations for U t, Ur, and U\u03c6 are completely independent of U\u03b8 at this order. We can therefore solve U t,r,\u03c6 independently from our solution for U\u03b8.\nIt is worth remarking that Eqs. (5.10) and (5.12) turn out to simplify further by converting them to equations for ut and u\u03c6. Doing so using by converting from U t,\u03c6 to ut,\u03c6, lowering an index, and then using ut = \u2212E\u0302 + uSt , u\u03c6 = L\u0302z + u S \u03c6 , where u S t,\u03c6 = O(S), we find\nduSt d\u03bb = \u2212 3s\u2016\u00b5(L\u0302z \u2212 aE\u0302)MU\u0302r r4 , (5.13) duS\u03c6 d\u03bb = 3as\u2016\u00b5(L\u0302z \u2212 aE\u0302)MU\u0302r r4 . (5.14)\nSolving Eqs. (5.13) and (5.14) is equivalent to solving (5.10) and (5.12), respectively. Finally, the equation we find for U\u03b8 is\ndU\u03b8\nd\u03bb + 2a4rE\u03022 \u2212 4a3rE\u0302L\u0302z + (r \u2212 2M)r3L\u03022z + a2(2r3E\u03022 + 2rL\u03022z \u2212 (U\u0302r)2) r2\u2206 \u03b4\u03d1S = \u22123s\u22a5\u00b5(L\u0302z \u2212 aE\u0302)M r3\u2206 ( \u03c3t(r 2 + a2)U\u0302r + \u03c3r [ E\u0302(r2 + a2)\u2212 aL\u0302z ] \u2206 + \u03c3\u03c6aU\u0302 r ) , (5.15)\nNotice that dU\u03b8/d\u03bb only couples to s\u22a5, and dU t,r,\u03c6/d\u03bb only couple to s\u2016. Notice further that we have not yet introduced an expansion in eccentricity. This means that for all nearly equatorial orbits, the small body\u2019s motion in the equatorial plane is totally decoupled from its outof-plane dynamics.\nFor equatorial and nearly equatorial orbits, we take the small body to move on a trajectory whose radial motion is given by\nr = pM\n1 + e cos\u03c7r . (5.16)\n16\nWe introduce here the orbit\u2019s the semi-latus rectum p and eccentricity e, as well as the radial true anomaly \u03c7r. This anomaly can be written\n\u03c7r = wr + \u03b4\u03c7r , (5.17)\nwhere wr is the radial mean anomaly. The difference between the radial mean and true anomalies, \u03b4\u03c7r, is an oscillatory function whose mean value is zero. In the Mino-time parameterization, wr = \u03a5r\u03bb.\nAs discussed in Sec. II, the parameterization (5.16) is used extensively in studies of geodesic motion. As we will show, it works perfectly for nearly equatorial orbits of spinning bodies as well. This form does not work so well for generic orbits of spinning bodies; for general orbit inclination, we need to allow the radial libration region to oscillate as the orbit precesses. This case is discussed in the companion analysis, Ref. [109].\nWe now solve for the orbit by introducing simultaneous expansions in the small body\u2019s spin and the orbit\u2019s eccentricity e. By requiring that Eqs. (5.10) \u2013 (5.12) hold order by order, we construct a full solution for the orbit of the small body\u2019s motion to that order in our expansion."

[Although there is a linear-in-eccentricity correction to \u03c7r, its impact on the small body\u2019s motion enters at O(e2).]\nTo first order in e, the radial motion of the small body is thus given by\nr = pM (1\u2212 e coswr) = pM [ 1\u2212 e\n2\n( eiwr + e\u2212iwr )] .\n(5.18) The second form proves to be particularly useful for our purposes.\nOur goal is to compute how the spin-curvature interaction affects all of the important parameters of our system.

(5.46)\nFor eccentric equatorial orbits, the precession phase takes the form\n\u03c8p = \u03a5s\u03bb+ \u03c8r , (5.47)\nwhere\n\u03a5s = M \u221a p+O(e2) = M\nv +O(e2) , (5.48)\nand where \u03c8r is a contribution to the precession phase that varies along the orbit\u2019s radial motion. Van de Meent [122] provides a general expression for \u03c8r; for small eccentricity, this expression reduces to\n\u03c8r = \u2212 2ev2(1\u2213 qv)2\n(1\u2212 2v2 + q2v4)\n\u221a 1\u2212 3v2 \u00b1 2qv3\n1\u2212 6v2 \u00b1 8qv3 \u2212 3q2v4 sinwr\n\u2261 e$(q, v) sinwr . (5.49)\nNote that \u03c8r \u221d ev2, and so by definition \u03c8r is a small quantity in the small eccentricity limit. This allows us to usefully expand cos(\u03c6s + \u03c8p):\ncos(\u03c6s + \u03c8p) = cos(\u03c6s + \u03a5s\u03bb+ e$ sinwr)\n= cos(\u03c6s + \u03a5s\u03bb) cos(e$ sinwr)\u2212 sin(\u03c6s + \u03a5s\u03bb) sin(e$ sinwr) ' cos(\u03c6s + \u03a5s\u03bb)\u2212 e$ sinwr sin(\u03c6s + \u03a5s\u03bb) .

(5.54)\nWe have put \u03c6s = 0 here for simplicity. Notice that the total radial frequency \u03a5r appears inside the sine and cosine functions, but the geodesic radial frequency \u03a5\u0302r appears outside these functions in these solutions. This is because A(\u03bb) and B(\u03bb) are used to build the O(S) out of plane precessional motion of the small body, and \u03a5r = \u03a5\u0302r +O(S). Using \u03a5r instead of \u03a5\u0302r outside of the sines and cosines would affect the solution at O(S2), and we neglect terms at this order.\nIt is important to note that the combination \u03a5\u0302r+\u03a5s\u2212 \u03a5\u03b8 can pass through zero. For example, when a = 0, this occurs for orbits that have v = \u221a (2 \u221a\n3\u2212 3)/3, for which p ' 6.464; for a = M , this occurs for orbits that have v = (1/2)(\u00b11/ \u221a 3 + \u221a 1/3 + 2/ \u221a 3, for which p ' 1.238 (prograde) and p ' 9.690 (retrograde). The general case smoothly connects these limiting forms as a function of a. At least naively, Eq. (5.53) appears to be poorly behaved at such \u201cresonant\u201d orbits, with certain terms diverging as this combination of frequencies passes through zero. It is not difficult to show, however, that the combination \u03b12 +\u03b11$ passes through zero at exactly the same orbits for which \u03a5\u0302r + \u03a5s = \u03a5\u03b8. Such resonances thus have no dynamical impact on the system. This is consistent with recent work [82, 92] which shows that spinning body orbits are integrable at leading order in the smaller body\u2019s spin.\nEquations (5.52), (5.53) and (5.54) show that the outof-plane motion of the small body depends on s\u22a5, is uncoupled from the in-plane motion, and is periodic, with structure at harmonics of the precession frequency \u03a5s, the radial frequency \u03a5r, and the polar frequency \u03a5\u03b8. As we consider more general configurations, we expect qualitatively similar behavior. We thus design our algorithm for describing the small body\u2019s orbital motion in the general case in order to capture such behavior."

            "text": "As our final \u201csimple\u201d case, we examine equatorial and eccentric orbits to second order in eccentricity. To keep the expressions relatively simple, we do this only for orbits of Schwarzschild black holes, and only examine the spin-aligned case. As we saw for the equatorial and nearly equatorial orbits discussed in the previous section, non-aligned small body spin decouples from all components of the body\u2019s orbit except the out-of-plane motion component U\u03b8, which is itself decoupled from the aligned spin and from all other components of the orbital motion. Focusing on the Schwarzschild limit of aligned spin orbits will be sufficient for us to develop a strategy for solving for this motion to high precision for more generic cases.\nThe two most important changes versus our previous analyses are that it will turn out we need to know many quantities describing geodesics to fourth order in e in order to compute corrections to the orbits of spinning bodies; and, we need a more complete accounting for the difference between the true anomaly \u03c7r and the mean anomaly wr \u2261 \u03a5r\u03bb. The need to go to fourth order in e may be somewhat surprising. The reason is that the radial velocity introduces a factor e; certain terms in the analysis which scale with U\u0302rU\u0302r or U\u0302\nrUSr have their order in eccentricity \u201cboosted\u201d by a factor of e2.\nTo describe the true anomaly, we generalize a functional form that is well known from studies of Keplerian orbits, writing\n\u03c7r = wr + [ e ( \u03b211 + \u03b2 S 11 ) + e3 ( \u03b231 + \u03b2 S 31 )] sinwr\n+ e2 ( \u03b222 + \u03b2 S 22 ) sin 2wr + e 3 ( \u03b233 + \u03b2 S 33 ) sin 3wr \u2261 wr + \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r + \u03b4\u03c7Sr . (5.55)\nThe quantity \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r stands for all the oscillatory geodesic terms (i.e., the terms with \u03b2ab) that take us from the mean anomaly to the true anomaly. The quantity \u03b4\u03c7Sr stands for the equivalent terms which arise from spincurvature coupling (the terms with \u03b2Sab).\n20\nOther quantities we need are the integrals of the motion and the radial frequency:\nE\u0302 = 1\u2212 2v2\u221a 1\u2212 3v2 + e2v2 2\n(1\u2212 4v2)2\n(1\u2212 2v2)(1\u2212 3v2)3/2\n+ e4v4\n8 (1\u2212 4v2)2(3\u2212 8v2) (1\u2212 2v2)3(1\u2212 3v2)5/2 , (5.56)\nL\u0302z = M \u221a p ( 1\u221a\n1\u2212 3v2 + e2v2 2\n1\n(1\u2212 3v2)3/2\n+ 3e4v4\n8\n1\n(1\u2212 3v2)5/2\n) , (5.57)\n\u03a5\u0302r = M \u221a p (\u221a 1\u2212 6v2 1\u2212 3v2 + e2v2 4 (1\u2212 9v2)(2\u2212 9v2) (1\u2212 3v2)3/2(1\u2212 6v2)3/2\n+ 3e4v4\n64 [8\u2212 25v2(1\u2212 3v2)(8\u2212 49v2 + 147v4)] (1\u2212 3v2)5/2(1\u2212 6v2)7/2\n) .\n(5.58)\nThe true anomaly (5.55), coupled with the form r = p/(1 + e cos\u03c7r), suffices to fully describe the radial motion. Turn next to the small body\u2019s motion in t and \u03c6. We parameterize this motion using the 4-velocity components\nut = \u2212E\u0302 + uSt , u\u03c6 = L\u0302z + u S \u03c6 . (5.59)\nRaising the index and multiplying by \u03a3 = r2, these components can be easily converted to the forms U t,\u03c6. We assume that the spin corrections to these 4-velocity com-\nponents take the form\nuSt = 3\u2211 n=\u22123 ust,ne \u2212inwr , uS\u03c6 = 3\u2211 n=\u22123 us\u03c6,ne \u2212inwr .\n(5.60) We generically find that us(t,\u03c6),n \u221d e |n|. We find that we don\u2019t have enough information to pin down these components for |n| > 3; presumably we need to describe the geodesic motion to higher order in order to do this.\nWe solve for the various unknown quantities we have introduced by enforcing Eqs. (5.10) \u2013 (5.12) and the constraint (3.31), and then gathering terms in spin and eccentricity. Terms at order (s\u2016)\n0 are geodesic, and can be used to find the coefficients which make \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r, defined in Eq. (5.55):\n\u03b211 = \u2212 v2\n1\u2212 6v2 , (5.61)\n\u03b222 = v4\n8(1\u2212 6v2)2 , (5.62)\n\u03b231 = \u2212 19v6\n16(1\u2212 6v2)3 , (5.63)\n\u03b233 = \u2212 v6\n48(1\u2212 6v2)3 . (5.64)\nTurn now to various aspects of the solution at order s\u2016. First, we find the following coefficients which define \u03b4\u03c7Sr :\n\u03b2S11 = s\u2016\u00b5\nM v3 (1\u2212 2v2) (1\u2212 6v2)2 , (5.65)\n\u03b2S22 = \u2212 s\u2016\u00b5\n4M v5(1\u2212 2v2) (1\u2212 6v2)3 , (5.66)\n\u03b2S31 = s\u2016\u00b5\n16M v7(25 + 156v2 \u2212 924v4) (1\u2212 2v2)(1\u2212 6v2)4 , (5.67)\n\u03b2S33 = s\u2016\u00b5\n16M v7(1\u2212 2v2) (1\u2212 6v2)4 . (5.68)\nWe next find the terms which define uS\u03c6 and u S t :\nuS\u03c6 = \u2212s\u2016\u00b5 ( 3v2\n2 (1\u2212 2v2) (1\u2212 3v2)3/2 + e2 v2 4 (2\u2212 5v2 \u2212 16v4 + 48v6) (1\u2212 2v2)(1\u2212 3v2)5/2\n) , (5.69)\nuSt = s\u2016\u00b5\nM\n( 3v5\n2 (1\u2212 2v2) (1\u2212 3v2)3/2 + 3ev5 coswr (1\u2212 3v2)1/2 + e2v5 4\n[ 2\u2212 25v2 + 126v4 + 234v6 + 6(1\u2212 3v2)2(1\u2212 7v2) cos 2wr ] (1\u2212 6v2)(1\u2212 3v2)5/2\n+ e3v5\n8\ncoswr [ 4\u2212 24v2 \u2212 81v4 + 459v6 + (4\u2212 84v2 + 513v4 \u2212 891v6) cos 2wr ] (1\u2212 6v2)2(1\u2212 3v2)3/2 ) . (5.70)\nFinally, we compute the shift to the radial frequency due to spin-curvature coupling:\n\u03a5Sr = 3s\u2016\u00b5\n2\n( v2(1\u2212 2v2)\n(1\u2212 3v2)3/2 \u221a 1\u2212 6v2 \u2212 e\n2v2\n12 (4\u2212 106v2 + 985v4 \u2212 4275v6 + 8928v8 \u2212 7452v10) (1\u2212 2v2)(1\u2212 3v2)5/2(1\u2212 6v2)5/2\n) . (5.71)\nNeglecting the terms in e2, this is consistent with the result we found previously, Eq. (5.35) in the limit q \u2192 0. In\n21\naddition, Eq. (5.35) agrees exactly with the \u03a5rS in Eq. (B26) obtained using the approach presented in Ref. [65]; see Appendix B for details of this comparison.\nSeveral other important quantities can be derived from what we computed here. Two that are particularly important are the axial frequency \u03a5\u03c6, and the quantity \u0393 which converts from Mino-time frequencies and periods to coordinatetime frequencies and periods. As discussed in Sec. II C, the axial frequency \u03a5\u03c6 is the orbit average of U \u03c6:\n\u03a5\u03c6 = 1\n2\u03c0 \u222b 2\u03c0 0 U\u03c6(wr)dwr . (5.72)\nUsing U\u03c6 = \u03a3g\u03c6\u03c6u\u03c6, we find\n\u03a5\u03c6 = M\nv \u221a 1\u2212 3v2\n( 1 +\ne2v2\n2(1\u2212 3v2) \u2212\n3s\u2016v 2\n2\n1\u2212 2v2\n1\u2212 3v2 \u2212 s\u2016e\n2v3\n4 (2\u2212 5v2 \u2212 16v4 + 48v6) (1\u2212 2v2)(1\u2212 3v2)2\n) .

(5.74)\nWith these quantities in hand, it is straightforward to compute \u2126r,\u03c6 = \u03a5r,\u03c6/\u0393. Finally, the shifts to the conserved integrals due to the spin-curvature interaction become.\n\u03b4ES = \u2212 s\u2016\u00b5v\n5\n2M(1\u2212 3v2)3/2\n( 1\u2212 e2 (4\u2212 15v 2)\n2(1\u2212 3v2)\n) , (5.75)\n\u03b4LSz = s\u2016\u00b5(2\u2212 13v2 + 18v4)\n2(1\u2212 3v2)3/2\n( 1\u2212 e 2v4\n2 (17\u2212 96v2 + 144v4) (1\u2212 2v2)2(1\u2212 3v2)(2\u2212 9v2)\n) . (5.76)\nAll of these quantities agree with Eqs. (B16) and (B17) which were obtained using the exact-in-eccentricity approach outlined in Appendix B.\nVI. SPINNING-BODY ORBITS III: FREQUENCY-DOMAIN TREATMENT\nWe now consider nearly equatorial orbits with arbitrary eccentricity, using a frequency-domain treatment of the spinning body\u2019s motion. As described in Sec. III D, the spin of the small body introduces the precession frequency \u03a5s into the analysis. The small body also shifts the orbital frequencies by an amount O(S) which we denote \u03a5Sr and \u03a5S\u03b8 . Functions evaluated on a spinning body\u2019s orbit can thus be written as a Mino-time Fourier expansion in terms of frequencies \u03a5r = \u03a5\u0302r + \u03a5 S r , \u03a5\u03b8 = \u03a5\u0302\u03b8 + \u03a5 S \u03b8 and \u03a5s:\nf(\u03bb) = 1\u2211 j=\u22121 \u221e\u2211 n,k=\u2212\u221e fjnke \u2212ij\u03a5s\u03bbe\u2212in(\u03a5\u0302r+\u03a5 S r )\u03bbe\u2212ik(\u03a5\u0302\u03b8+\u03a5 S \u03b8 )\u03bb . (6.1)\nThe Fourier coefficient fjnk is given by\nfjnk = 1\n\u039br\u039b\u03b8\u039bs \u222b \u039br 0 \u222b \u039b\u03b8 0 \u222b \u039bs 0 f (\u03bbr, \u03bb\u03b8, \u03bbs) e ij\u03a5s\u03bbsein(\u03a5\u0302r+\u03a5 S r )\u03bbreik(\u03a5\u0302\u03b8+\u03a5 S \u03b8 )\u03bb\u03b8d\u03bb\u03b8d\u03bbrd\u03bbs , (6.2)\nwhere \u039br,\u03b8,s = 2\u03c0/\u03a5r,\u03b8,s. By writing all relevant quantities as expansions of this form, we can compute the properties of spinning-body orbits to arbitrary precision, and develop a natural way of computing the frequency shifts \u03a5Sr and \u03a5S\u03b8 . As written, Eq. (6.1) is appropriate for generic spinning-body orbits. In this analysis, we examine orbits of arbitrary eccentricity that are equatorial or nearly equatorial; the generic case is developed and presented in a companion analysis [109]."

            "text": "We first consider eccentric orbits with the spin of the small body aligned with the orbit. The orbit\u2019s geometry\nin this case is exactly as in Sec. V C, but we now allow\n22\nfor arbitrary eccentricity. In this case, only radial oscillations are present in the motion, so all orbits can be described using expansions of the form\nf(\u03bb) = \u221e\u2211 n=\u2212\u221e fne \u2212in(\u03a5\u0302r+\u03a5Sr )\u03bb . (6.3)\nTo evaluate these expressions, we truncate the Fourier expansion at a finite value nmax. In Fig. 2, we examine the convergence of important properties of the orbit as we increase nmax. These residuals are computed by comparing our frequency-domain expansion for these quantities with an alternate method which is exact in eccentricity, but only applies to the spin-aligned case. This method, which is based on that described by Saijo et al. (Ref. [65]) is described in detail in Appendix B. Our results indicate that we can accurately handle large eccentricities (up to at least e \u223c 0.8) by increasing nmax, though larger e requires larger values of nmax in order in order to meet a prescribed level of truncation error.\nAs described in Sec. V A, we parameterize the radial motion as\nr = pM\n1 + e cos\u03c7r . (6.4)\nThis form guarantees that the motion is constrained to the interval p/(1 + e) \u2264 r \u2264 p/(1\u2212 e). As in Eq. (5.17), we write the true anomaly \u03c7r in Eq. (6.4) as\n\u03c7r = wr + \u03b4\u03c7r , (6.5)\nwhere wr is the mean anomaly and \u03b4\u03c7r is an oscillating contribution to \u03c7r. The oscillating contribution in turn has a piece associated with geodesic motion, \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r, and another piece that arises from spin-curvature coupling \u03b4\u03c7Sr = O(S),\n\u03b4\u03c7r = \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r + \u03b4\u03c7 S r . (6.6)\nThe mean anomaly also has geodesic and spin-curvature contributions:\nwr = ( \u03a5\u0302r + \u03a5 S r ) \u03bb , (6.7)\nwhere \u03a5Sr is the O(S)-correction to the radial Mino-time frequency. It is useful to write the true anomaly angles \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r and \u03b4\u03c7 S r as Fourier expansions 1,\n\u03b4\u03c7\u0302r = \u221e\u2211 n=\u2212\u221e \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r,ne \u2212inwr\u03bb , (6.8)\n\u03b4\u03c7Sr = \u221e\u2211 n=\u2212\u221e \u03b4\u03c7Sr,ne \u2212inwr\u03bb . (6.9)\n1 Note that if the function we are Fourier expanding already has a subscript, we use a comma to denote the specific Fourier mode. For example, \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r,1 is the n = 1 harmonic of function \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r.\nWe set \u03c7Sr,0 = 0; this amounts to a choice of initial true anomaly. Note that the geodesic Fourier coefficients \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r,n are known, as described in Sec. II. Observe, however, that wr includes the frequency correction \u03a5 S r , meaning that wr + \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r, with \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r given by Eq. (6.8), is not the same as the true anomaly for the corresponding geodesic orbit with the same radial turning points. We treat the non-oscillating part of the spinning body\u2019s true anomaly as almost identical to the non-oscillating part of the true anomaly belonging to the geodesic with the same turning points, differing only by an appropriate shift to the orbit\u2019s frequency. This cures a pathology associated with the fact that the rate at which the mean anomaly\n23\naccumulates for geodesic orbits differs at O(S) from the rate at which it accumulates for spinning-body orbits. This issue is described in more detail in Appendix A.\nAs in Eq. (5.59), we define the O(S)-corrections to the temporal and axial components of the 4-velocity by\nut = \u2212E\u0302 + uSt , u\u03c6 = L\u0302z + uS\u03c6 , (6.10)\nwhere uSt and u S \u03c6 can also be written as Fourier expansions,\nuSt = \u221e\u2211 n=\u2212\u221e uSt,ne \u2212inwr\u03bb , (6.11)\nuS\u03c6 = \u221e\u2211 n=\u2212\u221e uS\u03c6,ne \u2212inwr\u03bb . (6.12)\nWe divide both uSt and u S \u03c6 into a piece that is constant, and a piece that oscillates:\nuSt = u S t,0 + \u03b4u S t (\u03bb) , u S \u03c6 = u S \u03c6,0 + \u03b4u S \u03c6(\u03bb) . (6.13)\nWe can solve for the oscillating pieces using the t- and \u03c6- components of Eq. (3.16). Combining the axial and temporal components yields two equations of the form\nduS\u03c6 d\u03bb = R\u03c6 , duSt d\u03bb = Rt , (6.14)\nwhereR\u03c6 andRt are functions of known geodesic quantities. For the equatorial and nearly equatorial cases, Eqs. (6.14) are equivalent to Eqs. (5.13) \u2013 (5.14), and we can read out the functions R\u03c6 and Rt from there. The equations in (6.14) allow us to immediately solve for \u03b4uSt and \u03b4uS\u03c6 . The constants u S t,0 and u S \u03c6,0 are determined by the system\u2019s initial conditions; as described below, we solve for these quantities along with with the other unknowns, \u03b4\u03c7Sr and \u03a5 S r .\nTo make further progress, we insert Eqs. (6.4) and (6.10) into Eq. (3.16) and linearize in spin. By gathering in terms of unknown quantities, the radial component of Eq. (3.16) has the form\nFr d2\u03b4\u03c7Sr d\u03bb2 + Gr d\u03b4\u03c7Sr d\u03bb +Hr\u03b4\u03c7Sr + I1r\u03a5Sr + I2uSt,0 + I3uS\u03c6,0 + J = 0 . (6.15)\nIn this equation, we have gathered all the terms and functional behavior which are known (i.e., they depend on the behavior of the geodesic with p and e) into the functions Fr, Gr, Hr, I1r, I2, I3 and J . The explicit expressions for these functions in the Schwarzschild spacetime can be found in Appendix C 1. For Kerr, the expressions become rather unwieldy. We include a Mathematica notebook in the supplementary material which computes the expressions for a 6= 0. Note that we solved for \u03b4uSt and \u03b4uS\u03c6 when we solve (6.14); these functions are incorporated into J .\nWe also use u\u03b1u\u03b1 = \u22121 linearized in spin [i.e., Eq. (3.31)], as an additional constraint. This yields an equation of the form\nKr d\u03b4\u03c7Sr d\u03bb +Mr\u03b4\u03c7Sr +N1r\u03a5Sr +N2uSt,0 +N3uS\u03c6,0 + P = 0 , (6.16)\nwhere Kr, Mr, N1r, N2, N3 and P are again all functions2 of known quantities, and are listed in Appendix C 1 for Schwarzschild (with the Kerr versions included in supplemental material). The solutions for \u03b4uSt and \u03b4u S \u03c6 are here incorporated into the function P.\nTo solve for the unknown aspects of the spinning body\u2019s orbit, we write Fr, Gr, Hr, I1r, I2, I3, J , Kr, Mr, N1r, N2, N3 and P as Fourier expansions of the form shown in Eq. (6.3). We insert these expansions, along with Eq. (6.9), into Eqs. (6.15) and (6.16). Evaluating Eqs. (6.15) and (6.16) in the frequency domain, we turn this differential equation into a system of linear\n2 The functions Fr, Gr, etc. follow a mostly alphabetic sequence; however, we skip the letter L in our scheme to avoid confusion with the angular momentum 4-vector defined in Eq. (2.11).\nequations which can be expressed in the form\nM \u00b7 v + c = 0 , (6.17)\nwhere M is a matrix whose entries are related to the Fourier expansions of several of the functions appearing in Eqs. (6.15) and (6.16), and where c is a column vector whose entries are related to the Fourier expansion of the functions K and P. The entries of the column vector v are the problem\u2019s various unknown quantities, such as the spin-induced shift in the radial frequency \u03a5Sr . As an illustration of this equation\u2019s form, we have written out the explicit form of M, v, and c in Appendix C 2 for nmax = 1. Note that this value of nmax is far too small to achieve numerical convergence, and is used only for\n24\nillustrative purposes. The matrix equation is ungainly when written out for realistic values of nmax, though it poses no difficulties for numerical analysis. We then solve this system of linear equations for the unknown variables \u03b4\u03c7Sr , \u03a5 S r , u S \u03c6,0 and u S t,0. This yields a complete solution for the motion of the spinning body to first order in spin.\nWhen the small body\u2019s spin is aligned with the orbit, an alternative method based on Ref. [65] allows us to calculate \u03a5Sr exactly as a function of eccentricity; this method is described in detail in Appendix B. Figure 2 shows how \u03a5Sr , u S \u03c6,0 and u S t,0 converge to the exact result as we increase the value of nmax. For higher eccentricities, we need to include more harmonics (use a larger value of nmax) in order for the solution to converge to the same level of accuracy as the lower eccentricity orbit. For example, for an eccentricity of e = 0.7 (bottom panel of Fig. 2) we need nmax = 20 to obtain the same discrepancy between the exact and frequency-domain result as for e = 0.3 (top panel of Fig. 2) with nmax = 9.\nAn example of an aligned spinning body\u2019s equatorial orbit is shown in the left panel of Fig. 3. The geodesic orbit with the same radial turning points is overplotted for comparison. Notice the two ways in which the spinning body\u2019s radial motion differs from that of the geodesic. First, the radial frequency is shifted by \u03a5Sr . This effect can be very clearly seen in Fig. 3. Second, the shape of the orbit is modified due to the impact of the oscillatory term in the true anomaly \u03b4\u03c7Sr . This effect is quite a bit smaller, and is not obvious in the figure for this choice of parameters.\nIn the right panel of Fig. 3, we show uSt and u S \u03c6 , as well as corrections to the spinning body\u2019s energy \u03b4ES and axial angular momentum \u03b4LSz [using Eqs. (3.34) and (3.35)]. As expected, the oscillations \u2202\u03b2gt\u03b1S\n\u03b1\u03b2/(2\u00b5) and \u2202\u03b2gt\u03b1S \u03b1\u03b2/(2\u00b5) precisely cancel oscillations in \u03b4uSt and\n\u03b4uS\u03c6 ; upon summing, \u03b4E S and \u03b4LSz are indeed constant. The values for the spinning body\u2019s energy and axial angular momentum match those obtained using the alternative approach described in Appendix B; see App. B 2 b in particular."

            "text": "We now consider eccentric, nearly equatorial orbits, allowing the spin of the small body to have arbitrary orientation. As we saw in Secs. IV A, V C and VI A, if the spin of the small body is aligned with the orbit, the motion remains in the equatorial plane. However, if the spin of the test body is misaligned, the spin vector precesses, as described in Secs. IV B and V B. The spin precession introduces the frequency \u03a5s into the motion. Orbital quantities can then be described using expansions of the form\nf(\u03bb) = 1\u2211 j=\u22121 \u221e\u2211 n=\u2212\u221e fjne \u2212ij\u03a5s\u03bbe\u2212in(\u03a5\u0302r+\u03a5 S r )\u03bb . (6.18)\nThe spin precession induces out-of-plane motion, which we describe by introducing the new variable \u03b4\u03d1S , as in Secs. IV B and V B.

(6.22)\nWe have introduced ws = \u03a5s\u03bb.\nAs in Sec. VI A, we write the axial and temporal components of the 4-velocity in the form Eq. (6.13) and use Eq. (6.14) to find \u03b4uS\u03c6 and \u03b4u S t . We insert Eqs. (6.19), (6.20) and (6.10) into Eq. (3.16) and linearize in spin. Similarly to Sec. VI A, the radial component of Eq.

For nearly equatorial orbits,\n26\nG\u03d1 = H\u03d1 = 0. This is not the case for generic orbit geometry, which we discuss in a companion paper [109]; we include these functions in Eq. (6.23) in order to lay out the structure we need for the generic case.\nWhen the small body\u2019s spin is misaligned with the orbit, the body\u2019s motion takes it out of the equatorial plane. This requires us to include the \u03b8-component of Eq. (3.16) in our analysis. We linearize this equation in spin, yielding\nQ\u03d1 d2\u03b4\u03d1S d\u03bb2 + Sr d\u03b4\u03c7Sr d\u03bb + S\u03d1 d\u03b4\u03d1S d\u03bb + Tr\u03b4\u03c7Sr + T\u03d1\u03b4\u03d1S + U1r\u03a5Sr + U2uSt,0 + U3uS\u03c6,0 + V = 0 . (6.24)\nIn (6.24), the functions Q\u03d1, Sr, S\u03d1, Tr, T\u03d1, U1r U2, U3 and V all depend on known quantities. For nearly equatorial orbits, Sr = S\u03d1 = Tr = U1r = U2 = U3 = 0. This is not the case for the more generic orbits which we discuss in a companion paper [109]. As in our discussion of the spin-aligned case, we use u\u03b1u\u03b1 = \u22121 to obtain a linear-in-spin constraint which we write\nKr d\u03b4\u03c7Sr d\u03bb +K\u03d1 d\u03b4\u03d1S d\u03bb +Mr\u03b4\u03c7Sr +M\u03d1\u03b4\u03d1S +N1r\u03a5Sr +N2uSt,0 +N3uS\u03c6,0 + P = 0 . (6.25)\nHere, Kr, K\u03d1, Mr, M\u03d1, N1r,N2, N3 and P are again all functions of known quantities. For nearly equatorial orbits, L\u03b8 = M\u03b8 = 0. We list the Schwarzschild limit of all these functions in App. C 1, and include Kerr versions in our supplementary material.\nWe can now write Fr, Gr, G\u03d1, Hr, H\u03d1, I1r, I2, I3, J , Q\u03d1, Sr, S\u03d1, Tr, T\u03d1, U1r, U2, U3, V, Kr, K\u03d1, Mr, M\u03d1,\n27\nN1r, N2, N3 and P as Fourier expansions of the form given in Eq. (6.18). We insert these expansions, along with Eqs. (6.21) and (6.22), into Eqs. (6.23), (6.24) and (6.25). This turns these differential equations in linear algebraic ones; as in our discussion of aligned orbits in Sec. VI A, we gather terms into matrix form, and then solve for the for the unknown variables \u03b4\u03c7Sr , \u03b4\u03d1S , \u03a5 S r , uSt,0 and u S \u03c6,0. Further details about the matrix system corresponding to Eq. (6.24) are provided in Appendix C 2 and the explicit solution given for nmax = 1.\nAs discussed in Secs. IV B and V B, when the small body\u2019s spin is misaligned from the orbit, qualitatively distinct behaviour arises due to the spin\u2019s precession. For the nearly equatorial case, non-trivial polar motion \u03b4\u03d1S emerges, varying with the spin precession frequency \u03a5s. Note, though, that in the expansion (6.22) we do not include harmonics at frequency \u03a5\u03b8. Such harmonics can in principle be present, as we saw in Eqs. (5.52), (5.53), and (5.54). In the present analysis, we have only considered initial conditions such that the amplitude of the \u03a5\u03b8 harmonics are suppressed. In our companion study [109], we examine motion with \u03b4\u03d1S governed by the completely general form (6.1). The motion in this case has harmonics of all three frequencies are present.\nIn the left panel of Fig. 5, we show r and \u03b8 for a small body with misaligned spin; an equatorial geodesic with the same radial turning points is overplotted for comparison. The form of \u03b4\u03c7Sr and \u03b4\u03d1S for this orbit is shown in the right panels of Fig. 5. As in Sec. VI A, there are two main ways in which the radial motion of the spinning body differs from that of the geodesic with the same turning points: the radial frequency is shifted, and the shape of the orbit is modified by \u03b4\u03c7Sr . We have actually hidden the first effect by shifting the spinning-body orbit\u2019s radial frequency \u2014 the solid curve in Fig. 5 is a spinningbody orbit with the radial frequency \u03a5r = \u03a5\u0302r + \u03a5 S r replaced with \u03a5\u0302r. This allows us to more clearly show the impact of the shifted radial anomaly oscillation \u03b4\u03c7Sr \u2014 notice that the shifted geodesic sometimes moves faster, and sometimes slower, than the spinning-body orbit with which it is plotted. The frequency shift \u03a5Sr is exactly the same as for the equivalent aligned case except with s replaced by s\u2016. The harmonic content of cos \u03b8 is more complicated, exhibiting a beat between \u03a5r and \u03a5s. We also plot uSt and u S \u03c6 alongside the corrections to the spinning body\u2019s energy \u03b4ES and orbital angular momentum \u03b4LSz in the right panels of Fig. 5.\nFigure 2 displays the convergence of an orbit with aligned spin, while Figure 4 shows the convergence of an orbit with misaligned spin, where both orbits have the same radial turning points. We call the discrepancy between the exact result and our value for a certain nmax the \u201cresiduals\u201d. These residuals are normalized by the exact value of the quantity we are computing, so the values for \u03a5Sr , u S t,0 and u S \u03c6,0 are directly comparable. As nmax increases, the residuals decrease and approach closer to the true value, as expected. The convergence trend is identical for both the aligned and misaligned\ncases, except for the highest value of nmax for each of the different eccentricities. At this point, the working precision of the calculation is insufficient and the computation breaks down due to rounding error."

When the spin vector is misaligned, it precesses with Mino-time frequency \u03a5s, and the motion acquires a polar oscillation \u03b4\u03d1S whose magnitude is O(S). The solution in this case appears to diverge on \u201cresonances,\u201d orbits for which the radial and spin frequencies combine to be commensurate with the polar oscillation frequency: \u03a5\u0302r + \u03a5s = \u03a5\u03b8. In fact, the amplitude of the driving force vanishes at such frequencies, and the system is well behaved, in keeping with past work which demonstrated that nothing \u201cinteresting\u201d happens during spin-orbit resonances at least when considering the motion to leading order in spin [82, 92]. Sections IV and V presented analytic descriptions of nearly equatorial orbits that are circular and slightly eccentric respectively. In Sec. VI, we introduced a frequency-domain description of nearly equatorial orbits with arbitrary eccentricity.\nIn a companion paper, we use this frequency-domain approach to describe completely fully generic orbits \u2014 orbits that are both inclined and eccentric, with the small body\u2019s spin arbitrarily oriented [109]. It is worth remarking that, for the nearly equatorial orbits we consider here, spinning-body orbits share the same radial turning points as some equatorial geodesic orbit. For the nearly equatorial case, this \u201creference geodesic\u201d which shares the orbit\u2019s turning points serves as a particularly convenient point of comparison in analyzing the spinning body\u2019s orbit. This analysis becomes more complicated in the generic case, for which neither the polar nor the radial libration ranges coincide in general with those of a geodesic. We can nonetheless define a \u201creference geodesic\u201d whose turning points coincide with the spinning body\u2019s orbit in an orbit-averaged sense; details are given in Ref. [109]. We use this framework to compute corrections arising from the small body\u2019s spin to the orbital frequencies \u03a5r and \u03a5\u03b8 for generic orbits in Ref. [109]. In addition, we present a detailed comparison between our approach and the methods presented in Ref. [82] for the case of equatorial, spin-aligned orbits in Appendix B of the companion paper [109].\nResults in Ref. [143] suggest that the behavior near resonance of terms which are quadratic in spin plays a critical role in the emergence of chaotic motion via the KAM theorem. This is supported by Ref. [92] which contains a detailed numerical study of the growth of resonances and chaos for spinning-body motion in a Schwarzschild space-\n28\ntime. By using the techniques discussed here to provide a very accurate formulation of the linear-in-spin aspect of spinning-body orbits, we plan to extend work in Ref. [143] by investigating the behaviour of the quadratic in spin terms in the frequency domain. We hope this may clarify the precise manner in which nonlinear terms in the spinning-body equations of motion push such orbits from integrable to chaotic behavior in a Kerr background.\nAnother avenue for future work is to incorporate secondary spin into gravitational waveform models. An osculating geodesic integrator [150, 151] can be used to generate spinning-body worldlines. Any perturbed system of the form Dp\u03b1/d\u03c4 = \u03b4f\u03b1 can be described using an osculating geodesic framework, so long as \u03b4f\u03b1 is sufficiently small. In the EMRI limit we are interested in, both the spin-curvature force f\u03b1S and the self-force effects are small, so it should be possible to fold both into a forcing term and build a spinning-body inspiral. Such a framework has been developed for Schwarzschild orbits, and is presented in Ref. [105]; we hope to use a similar approach to model completely generic spinning-body Kerr inspirals. Ultimately, one hopes to build a fully self consistent self-force driven inpiral, and it is encouraging that the first steps have been taken in this direction [108]."

            "text": "In this paper, we seek periodic solutions to the linearin-spin Mathisson-Pappaptrou equations. As outlined in Sec. VI, we characterize the radial coordinate of spinningbody orbits using the parameterization\nr(\u03bb) = pM\n1 + e cos(wr + \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r(wr) + \u03b4\u03c7Sr ) , (A1)\nwhere\n\u03b4\u03c7\u0302r(wr) = \u221e\u2211 n=\u2212\u221e \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r,ne \u2212inwr , (A2)\n\u03b4\u03c7Sr = \u221e\u2211 n=\u2212\u221e \u03b4\u03c7Sr,ne \u2212inwr , (A3)\nand where\nwr = (\u03a5\u0302r + \u03a5 S r )\u03bb . (A4)\nThe quantities written with hat accents, \u03a5\u0302r and \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r, are computed using geodesic quantities \u2014 \u03a5\u0302r is the Minotime radial frequency for the geodesic with semi-latus rectum p and eccentricity e, and \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r describes the oscillating contribution to the true anomaly for that geodesic. The quantities \u03b4\u03c7Sr and \u03a5 S r are both O(S).\nAlthough \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r is computed using geodesic quantities, notice that as implemented in this formula we include O(S) terms in it via the mean anomaly angle wr. The Fourier coefficients \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r,n are identical to those for a geodesic orbit, but the angle wr in the exponent of Eq. (A2) includes an O(S)-term associated with the impact of the small body\u2019s spin on the orbit, \u03a5Sr . This takes into account the fact that the spinning-body orbit\u2019s frequencies are shifted by \u03a5Sr from those of the geodesic which shares its radial turning points.\nOur goal in this Appendix is examine how the spinning body\u2019s orbit is shifted from the trajectory of the geodesic which shares the same turning points. To expedite this comparison, in this Appendix we write the function \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r with an argument of either wr or w\u0302r, where w\u0302r = \u03a5\u0302r\u03bb. When we use \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r(wr), this is the function which parameterizes in part the true anomaly of a spinning body\u2019s orbit. This function\u2019s form is given explicitly by Eq. (A2); it oscillates in phase with the radial motion r(\u03bb) of the spinning body. On the other hand, \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r(w\u0302r) is the function that appears in the parameterization (A6) of the geodesic orbit. It is identical to the form in Eq. (A2) except with wr \u2192 w\u0302r. It oscillates in phase with the radial motion r\u0302(\u03bb) of the geodesic orbit.\nAs discussed in Sec. III E, we can define the difference between the spinning body\u2019s orbit and that of the geodesic which shares its turning points as follows:\n\u03b4rS(\u03bb) \u2261 r(\u03bb)\u2212 r\u0302(\u03bb) , (A5)\nwhere r(\u03bb) describes the radial motion of a spinning body\u2019s orbit, and r\u0302(\u03bb) describes the radial motion of the geodesic which shares its radial turning points. Note that \u03b4rS(\u03bb) = O(S).\nWe expect \u03b4rS(\u03bb) to contain secularly growing terms due to the difference in frequencies between the geodesic and the spinning body\u2019s motion. For the parameterization defined in Eq. (A1), the explicit expressions for r\u0302(\u03bb) and \u03b4rS(\u03bb) are:\nr\u0302(\u03bb) = pM\n1 + e cos (w\u0302r + \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r(w\u0302r)) (A6)\n29\nand\n\u03b4rS(\u03bb) = pMe \u03a5Sr \u03bb\n( 1\u2212 i \u2211 n n\u03b4\u03c7\u0302r,ne \u2212inw\u0302r ) + \u03b4\u03c7Sr (1 + e cos (w\u0302r + \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r(w\u0302r))) 2\n\u00d7 sin (w\u0302r + \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r(w\u0302r)) . (A7)\nThe secular growth of \u03b4rS apparent in Eq. (A7) is a somewhat troublesome mathematical artefact of the fact that we are comparing two integrable systems that have slightly different frequencies. This is troublesome because we would like to think of the spinning body\u2019s orbit as \u201cclose to\u201d the geodesic which shares its turning points. Though this describes the behavior of \u03b4rS for small \u03bb, this quantity evolves such that it eventually cannot be regarded as a perturbation.\nTo address this, we compare the two solutions in such a way that we avoid secularly growing terms, following a Poincare-Lindstedt-type approach. We begin by shifting the frequency of the geodesic solution so that it matches the frequency of the spinning-body orbit. Let us define\nr\u0302shift(\u03bb) = pM\n1 + e cos (wr + \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r(wr)) . (A8)\nThis is just Eq. (A6), but with the geodesic mean\nanomaly w\u0302r = \u03a5\u0302r\u03bb replaced by the mean anomaly wr = (\u03a5\u0302r + \u03a5 S r )\u03bb. We then define\n\u03b4rshiftS (\u03bb) = r(\u03bb)\u2212 r\u0302shift(\u03bb) , (A9)\nwhere again r(\u03bb) describes the radial motion of a spinning body\u2019s orbit. We introduce the superscript label \u201cshift\u201d to distinguish this quantity from that introduced in Eq. (A5), noting that its frequency is shifted from the geodesic frequency. Using Eqs. (A1) and (A8), we find\n\u03b4rshiftS (\u03bb) = pMe \u03b4\u03c7Sr (wr) sin [wr + \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r(wr)]\n(1 + e cos [wr + \u03b4\u03c7\u0302r(wr)]) 2 . (A10)\nThe quantity \u03b4rshiftS (\u03bb) does not grow secularly, but is instead periodic at the radial period \u039br = 2\u03c0/ ( \u03a5\u0302r + \u03a5 S r ) . We can use Fourier expansions quite naturally to describe \u03b4rshiftS (\u03bb) which is advantageous for the frequencydomain approach we use in this paper."

This yields closed-form expressions for \u03b4ES(p, e) and \u03b4LSz (p, e) analogous to Eqs. (B16) and (B17) which apply for general a, but are quite lengthy and cumbersome. We refer the reader to Eqs. (81) and (83) of Ref. [69] for expressions for ES and LSz to first order in small body spin derived by Mukherjee et al., as well as to Eqs. (38) and (39) of Ref. [103] for exact-in-S expressions for ES and LSz derived by Skoupy\u0301 et al. Both Skoupy\u0301 et al. and Mukherjee et al. write their expressions in terms of ra = pM/(1\u2212 e) and rp = pM/(1 + e). To first order in e, the results for \u03b4ES and \u03b4LSz reduce to Eqs. (4.17) \u2013 (4.18), but with\nv = \u221a\n1/p. We evaluate \u03a5Sr using a formulation analogous to what was done in Sec. B 1, replacing the Schwarzschild function RSchws (r) with R Kerr s (r):\n\u03a5Sr = 2\u03c0\n\u039b\u03022r \u222b \u03c0 0 \u03b4RKerrs (r) RKerr(r)3/2 dr d\u03c7r d\u03c7r . (B31)\nExpanded to first order in eccentricity, this reproduces Eq. (5.35).\nAppendix C: Explicit frequency-domain expressions\n1. Coefficient functions\nIn Sec. VI A, we examine spinning-body motion in the equatorial plane using a frequency-domain expansion. We linearize the radial component of the first Matthisson-Papapetrou equation (3.16) in small-body spin and re-express it in terms of quantities which are unknown (i.e., \u03b4\u03c7Sr , \u03a5 S r , u S t,0 and u S \u03c6,0) and Fourier coefficients of functions along geodesics (i.e., Fr, Gr, Hr, I1r, I2, I3 and J ). This yields Eq. (6.15). We also linearize the constraint u\u03b1u\u03b1 = \u22121 in small-body spin, writing down the corresponding equation (6.16) in terms of the same set of unknowns as well as coefficients Kr, Mr, N1r, N2, N3 and P that likewise arise from known geodesics. We follow a similar procedure in Sec. VI B to compute the nearly equatorial motion of a precessing spinning body. In this case, we also linearize the \u03b8-component of Eq. (3.16) in small-body spin, obtaining Eq. (6.24).\n32\nIn the nearly equatorial limit, the only non-zero coefficients in this equation are Q\u03d1, T\u03d1 and V. In this Appendix, we provide explicit expressions for the Schwarzschild case of the various functions which we then expand in the Fourier domain. These expressions for the functions appearing in Eq. (6.15) are given by:\nFr(\u03bb) = ep sin \u03c7\u0302r\n(1 + e cos \u03c7\u0302r)2 , Gr(\u03bb) =\nep ( \u03b4\u03c7\u0302\u2032r(\u03bb) + \u03a5\u0302r ) (e(cos(2\u03c7\u0302r) + 3)\u2212 2(p\u2212 2) cos \u03c7\u0302r)\n(1 + e cos \u03c7\u0302r)2(2e cos \u03c7\u0302r \u2212 p+ 2) , (C1)\nHr(\u03bb) = \u2212 ep\n4(e cos \u03c7\u0302r + 1)3(p\u2212 2\u2212 2e cos \u03c7\u0302r)2\n{ \u22122 sin \u03c7\u0302r [ 2L\u03022z ( e2(p\u2212 3)\u2212 (p\u2212 2)2 ) + \u03a5\u03022r ( e2(15\u2212 6p)\u2212 2(p\u2212 2)2 ) + 4E\u03022(p\u2212 3)p2 ] + e [ 2 sin(2\u03c7\u0302r) ( L\u03022z ( 2e2 + p2 \u2212 8p+ 12\n) \u2212 \u03a5\u03022r ( 7e2 + (p\u2212 2)p ) + 6E\u03022p2 ) + e ( e ( 2L\u03022z \u2212 \u03a5\u03022r ) sin(4\u03c7\u0302r) + sin(3\u03c7\u0302r) ( 2(2p\u2212 3)\u03a5\u03022r \u2212 4L\u03022z(p\u2212 3) ))]\n\u2212 2\u03b4\u03c7\u0302\u2032r(\u03bb) sin \u03c7\u0302r ( \u03b4\u03c7\u0302\u2032r(\u03bb) + 2\u03a5\u0302r )[ e2(e cos(3\u03c7\u0302r) + (6\u2212 4p) cos(2\u03c7\u0302r)) + e ( 15e2 + 2(p\u2212 2)p ) cos \u03c7\u0302r \u2212 2 ( e2(4p\u2212 9) + (p\u2212 2)2 )] + 2\u03b4\u03c7\u0302\u2032\u2032r (\u03bb)(e(cos(2\u03c7\u0302r)\u2212 3)\u2212 2 cos \u03c7\u0302r)(p\u2212 2\u2212 2e cos \u03c7\u0302r)2 } , (C2)\nI1r(\u03bb) = ep (\u039e2(\u03bb) sin \u03c7\u0302r) (e cos \u03c7\u0302r + 1)2 + ep (\u039e1(\u03bb) + 1)\n( \u03b4\u03c7\u0302\u2032r(\u03bb) + \u03a5\u0302r ) (e(cos(2\u03c7\u0302r) + 3)\u2212 2(p\u2212 2) cos \u03c7\u0302r)\n(e cos \u03c7\u0302r + 1)2(2e cos \u03c7\u0302r \u2212 p+ 2) , (C3)\nI2(\u03bb) = \u2212 2E\u0302p3\n(e cos \u03c7\u0302r + 1)2(p\u2212 2\u2212 2e cos \u03c7\u0302r) , I3(\u03bb) = L\u0302z\n( 4\u2212 2p\ne cos \u03c7\u0302r + 1\n) , (C4)\nJ (\u03bb) = 3E\u0302L\u0302zS\u03b8(1 + e cos \u03c7\u0302r) p \u2212 2E\u0302p 3\u03b4uSt (\u03bb) (1 + e cos \u03c7\u0302r)2(p\u2212 2\u2212 2e cos \u03c7\u0302r) \u2212 2L\u0302z\u03b4u S \u03c6(\u03bb)(p\u2212 2\u2212 2e cos \u03c7\u0302r) (1 + e cos \u03c7\u0302r) , (C5)\nwhere we have defined\n\u039e1(\u03bb) = \u2212i nmax\u2211\nn=\u2212nmax\nn\u03b4\u03c7\u0302r,ne \u2212in\u03a5\u0302r\u03bb , and \u039e2(\u03bb) = \u22122\u03a5\u0302r nmax\u2211 n=\u2212nmax n2\u03b4\u03c7\u0302r,ne \u2212in\u03a5\u0302r\u03bb .

(C10)\nIn the nearly equatorial limit, the only non-zero functions which appear in Eq.

(C12)\n33\nIn the Supplemental Material accompanying this paper, we include a Mathematica notebook which computes these expressions for general Kerr (i.e., for a 6= 0) [152].\n2. Matrix System\nAs discussed in Sec. VI A, our procedure to solve for the spinning body\u2019s orbit in the frequency domain involves writing the functions Fr, Gr, Hr, I1r, I2, I3 J , Kr, Mr, N1r, N2, N3 and P as Fourier expansions of the form\nf(\u03bb) = nmax\u2211 n=\u2212nmax fne \u2212in\u03a5\u0302r\u03bb . (C13)\nWe similarly express the unknown function \u03b4\u03c7Sr (\u03bb) as a Fourier expansion,\n\u03b4\u03c7Sr (\u03bb) = nmax\u2211 n=\u2212nmax \u03b4\u03c7Sr,ne \u2212in\u03a5\u0302r\u03bb , (C14)\naiming to solve for its Fourier coefficients \u03b4\u03c7Sr,n. To do so, we insert expansions (C13) and (C14) into Eqs. (6.15) and (6.16). This yields a system of linear equations in the frequency-domain which allows us to solve for the unknown variables \u03b4\u03c7Sr , \u03a5 S r , u S \u03c6,0 and u S t,0. This system of equations can be written\nM \u00b7 v + c = 0 . (C15)\nTo get a sense of the character of this system of equations, for the choice nmax = 1, the matrix M and vectors v and c are given explicitly by\nM =  \u2212Fr,0\u03a5\u03022r \u2212 iGr,0\u03a5\u0302r \u2212Hr,0 0 I1r,1 I2,1 I3,1 \u2212Fr,\u22121\u03a5\u03022r \u2212 iGr,\u22121\u03a5\u0302r \u2212Hr,\u22121 \u2212Fr,1\u03a5\u03022r + iGr,1\u03a5\u0302r +Hr,1 I1r,0 I2,0 I3,0 0 \u2212Fr,0\u03a5\u03022r + iGr,0\u03a5\u0302r +Hr,0 I1r,\u22121 I2,\u22121 I3,\u22121 Mr,0 \u2212 iKr,0\u03a5\u0302r 0 N1r,1 N2,1 N3,1 Mr,\u22121 \u2212 iKr,\u22121\u03a5\u0302r Mr,1 + iKr,1\u03a5\u0302r N1r,0 N2,0 N3,0\n0 Mr,0 + iKr,0\u03a5\u0302r N1r,\u22121 N2,\u22121 N3,\u22121\n , (C16)\nv =  \u03b4\u03c7Sr,1 \u03b4\u03c7Sr,\u22121\n\u03a5Sr uSt,0 uS\u03c6,0  , and c =  J1 J0 J\u22121 P1 P0 P\u22121  . (C17)\nNote that M is not a square matrix; the system is slightly overconstrained. We use the PseudoInverse Mathematica function to find the values of \u03b4\u03c7Sr,1, \u03b4\u03c7 S r,\u22121, \u03a5 S r , u S t,0, u S \u03c6,0 that satisfy the system of the equations to within a certain tolerance. (We strongly emphasize that nmax = 1 is too small to accurate describe spinning-body orbits in almost all cases; this is merely used to illustrate the character of this system of linear equations.)\nIn the case of a nearly equatorial orbit, the polar and radial equations decouple such that we can solve Eq. (C15) above independently of the equation for the \u03b8-motion. The \u03b8-equation (6.24) has only three non-zero coefficients in the nearly equatorial limit, Eqs. (C11) \u2013 (C12). We insert the values for Q\u03d1 and T\u03d1 and write V as a Fourier expansion of the form\nf(\u03bb) = 1\u2211 j=\u22121 nmax\u2211 n=\u2212nmax fjne \u2212ij\u03a5s\u03bbe\u2212in\u03a5\u0302r\u03bb . (C18)\nWe also write \u03b4\u03d1S as a Fourier expansion,\n\u03b4\u03d1S(\u03bb) = 1\u2211 j=\u22121 nmax\u2211 n=\u2212nmax \u03b4\u03d1S,jne \u2212ij\u03a5s\u03bbe\u2212in\u03a5\u0302r\u03bb . (C19)\n34\nWe take nmax = 1 again, obtaining the following solution for Fourier coefficients of \u03b4\u03d1S :\n \u03b4\u03d1S,\u22121,\u22121 \u03b4\u03d1S,0,\u22121 \u03b4\u03d1S,1,\u22121 \u03b4\u03d1S,\u22121,0 \u03b4\u03d1S,0,0 \u03b4\u03d1S,1,0 \u03b4\u03d1S,\u22121,1 \u03b4\u03d1S,0,1 \u03b4\u03d1S,1,1  = \u2212  V\u22121,\u22121 L\u03022z\u2212(\u03a5\u0302r+\u03a5s)2 V0,\u22121 L\u03022z\u2212\u03a5\u03022r V1,\u22121 L\u03022z\u2212(\u03a5\u0302r\u2212\u03a5s)2 V\u22121,0 L\u03022z\u2212\u03a52s 0 V1,0 L\u03022z\u2212\u03a52s V\u22121,1 L\u03022z\u2212(\u03a5\u0302r\u2212\u03a5s)2 V0,1\nL\u03022z\u2212\u03a5\u03022r V1,1\nL\u03022z\u2212(\u03a5\u0302r+\u03a5s)2\n .
