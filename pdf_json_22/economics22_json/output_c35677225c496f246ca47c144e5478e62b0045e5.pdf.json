            "text": "Adequate water resources are a prerequisite for ensuring the social and economic development of a region. With the rapid economic development and the continuous growth of the population, the limited water resources cannot tolerate higher consumption, and the carrying capacity of water resources is facing severe tests [1]. e carrying capacity of water resources is not only an important prerequisite for achieving sustainable development in a region but also the key to solving water resources problems [2]. rough the analysis of the research status of sustainable utilization of coastal water resources at home and abroad, the research on sustainable utilization of coastal water resources mainly focuses on the research on the relationship between supply and demand of coastal water resources and measures the supply and demand of coastal water resources from two aspects. However, there are few studies on the internal role of coastal water resources-socioeconomic-ecological-environment composite system, especially the relationship\nbetween water-use e ciency and economic development. With the increasing shortage of coastal water resources, the research on the relationship between water use e ciency and economic development has become the key to realizing the sustainable utilization of coastal water resources; in the selection of evaluation indicators, most studies only focus on the indicators of water supply, water use and social and economic development, while the indicators of ecological environment water use are ignored. With the acceleration of the urbanization process, the impact of human activities on the coastal water resources system has been increasing, and the ecological environment water consumption has gradually increased. erefore, in the process of considering the sustainable utilization of coastal water resources, the ecological environment water use has become an indispensable factor.\nOn the basis of analyzing and summarizing the relevant research results of water resources and environmental management at home and abroad, this paper combines the current situation of water resources development and\nHindawi Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience Volume 2022, Article ID 9959933, 9 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/9959933\nutilization in the study area and cloud computing technology to construct a comprehensive analysis system for water resources in the study area [3]. It uses the process analytic hierarchy process and entropy method to formulate indicator weights and uses a multilevel fuzzy comprehensive analysis model to evaluate and analyze the current status of water resources in the study area and the temporal and spatial changes of water resources [4]. Subsequently, early warning and forecasting of the water resources environmental management status in 2020, 2022, and 2035 were carried out, to propose corresponding measures to improve the water carrying capacity, and to provide a reference for ensuring the rational development, utilization, and distribution of water resources in the study area. Based on this point, the article investigates the pilot projects based on environmental economics [5, 6]. As the main body of the economic zone on the west coast of the Straits, the study area takes marine economy as a strategic force for the future economic society and seeks to establish an economic blue pilot zone on the west coast of the Straits [7]. %e key to implementing the development strategy of \u201cStrong Ocean Province\u201d in the research area is to follow the concept of \u201cgreen growth, circular development and environmental protection\u201d in the process of marine economic development. Research and design a typical model of marine circular economy development, with a view to efficient utilization of marine resources, thereby protecting the marine environment, and correctly handling the interactive relationship between development and environmental protection [8]. From the perspective of industrial development, this article puts forward the basic principles of circular economy development: development purpose, overall structure, industrial concentration, regional structure, and transformation of construction mode, etc. [9]. In the research area\u2019s marine economic development model, the research area is focused on marine fisheries (including aquaculture and marine processing industry), marine comprehensive utilization industry, ship dismantling and transformation, coastal tourism, construction, maritime engineering, and shipping [10]. %e main ideas for the economic development of the marine environment are based on the above-mentioned industrial resources and environmental advantages and development conditions, to create a customary model of the economic development circle, and finally from the construction and improvement of legal and management systems, policy support systems, technical assistance systems, evaluation index systems, and the advertising and education system put forward opinions and suggestions to promote the development of circular marine economy in the study area [11]."

According to the graphs of the water consumption of the three industries, the main industry\u2019s water consumption has always been the main body of production water; the primary and secondary industries have experienced many changes before the 21st century and gradually stabilized after entering the 21st century. Water consumption has been at a low level since it was produced.\nAt the end of the 20th century, with the gradual deterioration of the environment, people began to pay attention to the issue of ecological water use and make records. As a large province in the northeast old industrial base, the research area is particularly important for its industrial development characteristics, adjustment of industrial structure, and coordination of the relationship between industry and ecology. As the ecological environment water consumption was recorded late, the curve diagram is shown in Figure 1 based on the ecological environment water consumption data in the study area from 2008 to 2020.\nAccording to calculations, the average annual growth rate of water consumption in the ecological environment from 2008 to 2020 is as high as 16.58%. It can be seen from Figure 1 that, except for a slight decrease in the water consumption in the ecological environment in individual years, the overall increase has remained relatively large increase. Although the eco-industry is still in its infancy in the research area, with the increasing attention of people and the improvement of environmental protection awareness, the eco-industry has great potential and is also a new type of industry with goodmarket prospects that is worth exploring.\nIn order to observe the differences more accurately in the spatial structure of water use in the study area through information entropy, based on the calculation results of the urban degree balance in the study area, the 2020 ArcG IS image is drawn as shown in the following Figure 2.\nAs shown in Figure 2, by 2020, the color difference of images will increase, so the structural difference of water use in each city will increase. City D in the southern region has the most balanced water use structure and has always maintained the highest level in the province. City S in the northern region has optimized its water use structure, while City A, City B, and City L in the central region are more unstable than in 2010 or even 2005; City H in the western region compared with 2010, the water consumption structure has been further improved, and it is basically the same as City S, City F, and even City D.\nAccording to the calculation results of the location entropy of each city and the cumulative percentage of domestic and production water consumption in 2010, the Lorentz process curve is shown in Figure 3:\nIt can be seen from the figure that the minimum curvature curve is the Lorentz curve of the water consumption of the primary industry; the water consumption curve of the\nsecondary industry is the second, and the average is far from the absolute average."

Research on the StatusQuo of theDevelopment of Circular EconomyIndustry. According to the economic development of the coastal industrial zone, based on the comparison and selection of waste recycling technology in the sintering process at home and abroad, the specific materials for the steel sintering process and the steel energy recovery method\nare shown in Table 4. Especially for the recycling of raw materials, the recycling of sintering machine desulfurization by-products, the recycling of sintering ore, and sintering flue gas waste heat, etc.\nInformation system construction is an important part of the eco-industrial park. %e information center plays an important role in the industrial ecosystem, which is the basis for the recycling of materials, energy, and water. By building a unique product marketing platform, it will help companies understand the latest status of logistics, energy, and waste recycling in the park and be able to adapt to the above conditions, so as to achieve the sustainable development of the overall industrial chain. %e stable operation of the ecoindustrial park is inseparable from supporting infrastructure such as water supply installations, sewage treatment plants, water installations, power supply and heating installations, and sewage treatment.%e construction of infrastructure is a\nnecessary condition for realizing efficient recycling management of logistics, energy flow, information flow, and water flow, as well as a prerequisite for ensuring the efficient operation of the park\u2019s ecological network.\n3.4. Analysis of the Ways of Recycling and Utilizing Coastal Resources. As shown in Figure 4, after the seawater is cooled, its by-products will be discharged in a low-permeability background.%e seawater desalination technology produces fresh water and then uses the concentrated salt water produced after reverse osmosis as the raw material of the salt industry to produce potassium, magnesium, bromine, and other salt chemicals to realize the widespread use of seawater.\nSolid waste treatment system, the company has strengthened the management of solid waste generated in the process of dismantling ships, the recycling of recyclable parts, and the timely disposal of nonrecyclable parts. %rough strict control of recyclable and nonrecyclable solid waste, it can avoid pollution and damage to the environment.\nSince the development of this region is greatly affected by policy factors, the relevant indicators of the coastal circular economy are more likely to be affected by administrative intervention. %erefore, this study combines the corresponding planning data and adopts the quota method to analyze the indicators of the coastal circular economy in the study area. Make predictions. %is study builds an early warning indicator system for coastal circular economy based on the balance of water supply and demand, which can effectively use the available information and easily reflect the future resource recycling situation. It can be seen from the relevant research results of this paper that the water resources monitoring and early warning system in a certain area can analyze, predict, and evaluate the status quo of the coastal circular economy and the carrying capacity of the future period of time.

By constructing the overall framework of the economic development model of the ocean circle, the lead agency is required to cover enterprises, governments, and the public and promote the development of the ocean economy through their own initiatives.\n%e core of the marine circular economy circle is the continuous development of the marine industry and the efficient use of marine resources [15]. Based on this, the development of marine recycling industry should focus on marine resource industries such as aquaculture, oil and gas, and comprehensive utilization industries. Since the study area has not yet been involved in themarine oil and gas industry, the development of marine fisheries (including marine aquaculture, product processing, etc.) should be focused on the actual development of the marine industry in the study area [16]. On the other hand, the use, dismantling and construction of marine vessels and coastal tourism, marine engineering construction, and maritime navigation will establish a typical economic environment model based on marine fishing, comprehensive utilization of seawater, dismantling, and reconstruction.\n%e marine fishery development model mainly introduces the economic development concept of marine aquaculture and seafood processing to realize the reduction, reuse, and recycling of marine resources. %e economic development of marine fisheries is an important way to promote the innovation and modernization of traditional fishery development models [17]. From the perspective of the marine fishing industry chain, whether it is the cultivation and fishing of marine biological sources or the processing of marine seafood, it can be reused and updated to conform to the three principles of the economic growth cycle: recycling, reuse, reduction, and circular development, so as to achieve the goal of sustainable growth [18, 19].\nCreating a comprehensive fishing cycle model, including energy-saving and emission reduction in the breeding process, recycling of seawater, and comprehensive\nutilization of processing resources, is very important for achieving sustainable growth in marine fishing [20]. Combining the actual situation of the study area, it is possible to consider building an ecological industrial marine fishery park integrating fishing, aquaculture, and seafood processing in a suitable coastal area to form a fishery demonstration base. %e standard is consistent with the functions of the natural ecosystem, combining fishing, aquaculture, and marine processing, establishing waste exchange and recycling between industrial waste chains, creating an ecological marine fishery chain, and realizing horizontal symbiosis between industrial industries chain (see Figure 5)."

(2) Strictly control the use of groundwater: strictly control the exploitation of a large amount of groundwater, especially all public wells and self-provided wells and water supply wells in restricted mining areas, prohibited mining areas, and severely overexploited areas. %rough closed and comprehensive treatment of groundwater overexploitation areas, groundwater replenishment is strengthened, so as to ensure\nthat the groundwater level stops falling and rises, and finally achieves a balance between groundwater exploitation and filling. (3) Speed up the improvement of water-saving infrastructure: promote the implementation of the secondstage sand source control project in the study area and the national key water and soil conservation project to reduce regional soil erosion and erosion; build rural water supply projects to strengthen rural areas; water and soil loss management and control, implementation of water safety management, and water source protection, etc."

In view of the utilization of marine environmental resources, a reliable guarantee system for the economic development of the marine environment will be constructed, so as to provide a good foundation for efficient and stable operation. %is article intends to establish and improve the guarantee system for the implementation of the marine economic development model from the perspective of government economic management, including legal and management systems, policy support systems, technical assistance systems, evaluation index systems, and advertising education systems.\nLaw is the basis for the establishment and implementation of the system, and it is also an effective guarantee for the correct implementation of policies. A sound system of laws and regulations is conducive to creating a fair and just environment for the development of the marine economy and plays a vital role in starting the marine economy of the study area. %e direct reason for the change of the model is the introduction of policies to incorporate the development of the marine economy into the macrolevel marine economic development plan and to develop a circular economy as the guide, thereby promoting the development of the marine economy. When formulating marine industry policies, the government should focus on\nimproving resource e ciency and protecting the marine environment and promote the restoration and modernization of the marine industry structure. e \u201cTwelfth FiveYear\u201d National Plan clearly proposes to challenge the scienti c use of marine resources and actively develop circular economy as an important part of marine economic development. e relevant plans re\u00a9ect the importance of developing the marine economic circle and promote the development of marine economic policy measures, give play to the leading demonstration role of economic development, play the role of policy guidance and support, and promote the development of marine economy. e policy support system for the development of the marine economic circle in the research area should include the industrial policy system, the scal policy system, the tax policy system, and the nancial policy system.\nIn recent years, the study area has maintained good economic and social development with good development opportunities. e main task of government departments at all levels is to promote sustained and rapid economic growth. e economic development of all coastal cities in the study area is currently in a critical period.

Relevant departments must strengthen their own construction, establish, and improve marine economic management mechanisms, formulate marine economic policies, and manage and promote the implementation of marine economics in accordance with the law.

In the process of vigorously promoting the development of the development strategy, the problems of marine resources and the environment have become increasingly prominent, and there are practical problems such as the destruction of the marine ecological environment and the waste of marine resources. e development of predatory marine tourism resources has caused serious damage to the marine ecological environment in coastal areas. e development of marine circular economy is of great signi cance for promoting sustainable utilization of marine resources and reducing marine environmental pollution. e article investigates the in\u00a9uencing factors of water resources carrying capacity in the study area and integrates the research results of other researchers on the selection of relevant indicators of water resources carrying capacity and selects appropriate indicators from four aspects of water resources, economy, society, and ecological environment. To establish a water source system assessment system in the study area, by dividing the system carrying capacity index and the water carrying capacity state into ve categories, the AHPmethod and the entropy weight method are integrated, the weight index system is combined according to objective factors, and the fuzzy multilevel evaluation method is integrated to select the water resources in the research area in recent years. Finally, based on reading many relevant materials, the author systematically studied various marine industries and related technologies, visited relevant departments, parks, and government-managed enterprises, initially established a typical research model for the development of circular economy, and targeted the goals of the study area.
