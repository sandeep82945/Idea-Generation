    "abstractText": "Aging transition is an emergent behavior observed in networks consisting of active (self-oscillatory) and inactive (non self-oscillatory) nodes, where the network transits from a global oscillatory state to an oscillation collapsed state when the fraction of inactive oscillators surpasses a critical value. However, the aging transition in quantum domain has not been studied yet. In this paper we investigate the quantum manifestation of aging transition in a network of active-inactive quantum oscillators. We show that, unlike classical case, the quantum aging is not characterized by a complete collapse of oscillation but by sufficient reduction in the mean boson number. We identify a critical \u201cknee\u201d value in the fraction of inactive oscillators around which quantum aging occurs in two different ways. Further, in stark contrast to the classical case, quantum aging transition depends upon the nonlinear damping parameter. We also explain the underlying processes leading to quantum aging that have no counterpart in the classical domain.",

However, the aging transition in quantum domain has not been studied yet. In this paper we investigate the quantum manifestation of aging transition in a network of active-inactive quantum oscillators. We show that, unlike classical case, the quantum aging is not characterized by a complete collapse of oscillation but by sufficient reduction in the mean boson number. We identify a critical \u201cknee\u201d value in the fraction of inactive oscillators around which quantum aging occurs in two different ways. Further, in stark contrast to the classical case, quantum aging transition depends upon the nonlinear damping parameter. We also explain the underlying processes leading to quantum aging that have no counterpart in the classical domain.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nCoupled oscillators constitute an important framework to understand several phenomena and processes in physics, biology, and engineering [1]. Depending upon the nature and strength of coupling, diverse collective behaviors are identified, such as synchronization, oscillation suppression, cluster formation, and chimera patterns [2\u20136]. In this context, Daido and Nakanishi [7] in a seminal paper reported an interesting emergent behavior in coupled oscillators, namely the aging transition. They considered a network of globally coupled oscillators in which a fraction of oscillators are in the inactive or non-self-oscillatory state and the rest of the oscillators are in the active or self-oscillatory state. Remarkably, it was shown that, when the fraction of inactive oscillators reaches a critical value, the inactive oscillators bring down the whole network to a non-self-oscillatory steady state. The transition from macroscopic oscillatory state to a globally cessation state due to the interplay of activeinactive oscillators mediated by coupling was defined as the aging transition by Daido and Nakanishi [7]. Note that the aging state is different from the conventional amplitude death state: while the former state is due to the interaction between active and inactive nodes [7, 8], in the latter state active oscillators interact among themselves to achieve oscillation cessation state [9\u201312]. The aging transition is much relevant in biology and technology where maintaining oscillations is essential for the proper functioning of the system (e.g. in brain waves in neuroscience [13], cardiopulmonary sinus rhythm of pacemaker cells [14], and power grids [15]) as degradation (or aging) of some nodes in these systems may lead to irrecoverable pathological condition or system breakdown. Several studies were reported to either verify the transition in diverse systems [16\u201319] or to propose schemes for\n\u2217 tbanerjee@phys.buruniv.ac.in; he/his/him\nrevoking the transition [20\u201322]. However, all the studies are made in the classical domain (see [8] and references therein).\nIn this work, we ask the question \u201cDoes the aging transition take place in the quantum domain, as well?\u201d if yes, what will be its manifestation? Our study is motivated by the recent endeavor of studying the well known results of classical nonlinear dynamics in the quantum domain. It is intriguing that most of the well known phenomena of classical nonlinear dynamics behaves in a counter intuitive way in the quantum domain [23]. A few prominent examples are, synchronization [24\u201329], oscillation suppression [30, 31], and symmetry-breaking states [32\u201337]. These surprising results are attributed to the presence of inherent quantum noise, discrete energy levels, entanglement, which do not have any counterpart in classical domain. Apart from the theoretical motivation, the study of aging in the quantum domain is further motivated by the fact that system degradation or aging is inevitable in real-world quantum systems mainly due to the unwanted losses, for example, due to lossy cavity [38], mechanical dissipation in optomechanical systems [39, 40], loss of trapped-ion due to collision [41], and dielectric losses of superconducting junction in circuit quantum electrodynamics [42].\nIn this paper we show that aging transition indeed occurs in the quantum regime albeit its manifestation is different from that of the classical one. We consider a network of coupled active-inactive quantum Stuart-Landau oscillators under global diffusive coupling. Using the formalism of open quantum systems, we define the notion of active and inactive nodes in the quantum domain based on the nature of dissipators in the quantum master equation. We show that, quantum aging is not characterized by a complete cessation to a collapsed state but a rapid decrease in the mean boson number with increasing fraction of inactive oscillator. We observe that there exists a critical \u201cknee\u201d value of the fraction of the inactive units around which the network exhibits two different trend of decrement in the mean boson number.

            "text": "For a better understanding of the quantum aging transition, let us start with a brief discussion on its classical counterpart [7]. The mathematical model ofN diffusively coupled identical Stuart-Landau oscillators under global coupling is given by (using a slightly different form than [7] to make it compatible with the quantum model),\n\u03b1\u0307j = (\u2212i\u03c9 + Gj\n2 \u2212 \u03ba|\u03b1j |\n2)\u03b1j + V\nN\nN\u2211\nj\u2032=1\n(\u03b1j\u2032 \u2212 \u03b1j) , (1)\nwhere \u03b1j = xj + iyj is the complex amplitude of the j-th oscillator having eigenfrequency \u03c9 (j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7N). Here Gj and \u03ba are the linear pumping rate and nonlinear damping rate of the jth oscillator, respectively. V is the coupling strength: for V = 0, Eq. (1) represents uncoupled classical Stuart-Landau oscillators. In the uncoupled system, Gj determines the activeness of the jth oscillator: if Gj > 0 the oscillator is active and shows limit cycle oscillation, on the other hand, if Gj < 0 the oscillator is inactive, i.e., non self-oscillatory. The network of N coupled oscillators consists of two groups of nodes: Na nodes (Na \u2264 N) are active and Ni nodes are inactive, with Na + Ni = N . In the active group, an oscillator has Gj = a > 0 (j \u2208 {1, 2, ..., Na})\nand in the inactive group, a node has Gj = \u2212b < 0 (j \u2208 {Na + 1, ..., N}). We define the fraction of inactive nodes in the network as p = Ni\nN = N\u2212Na N . The aging\ntransition can be tracked using the normalized order parameter Qcl = |Z(p)| |Z(0)| , where Z = 1 N \u2211N j=1 \u03b1j . Here Z(p) and Z(0) are the values of Z for the fraction of inactive oscillators equal to p and zero, respectively. Using a linear stability analysis, it can be shown that beyond a critical coupling strength (Vc), if p goes beyond a critical value, given by\npc = a(2V + b)\n2(a+ b)V , (2)\nthe network collapses into a global non self-oscillatory state [7]. From (2) the critical coupling strength is given by Vc = a 2 . The result is demonstrated in Fig.1 for a = 4 and b = 2. It shows that for V > Vc(= 2), aging transition occurs (i.e., Qcl becomes zero from a nonzero value) even if the fraction of inactive oscillator p < 1. Also, for V > Vc the critical value of p (i.e., pc) decreases with increasing V . Interestingly, note that (2) does not depend upon \u03ba, i.e., classical aging transition does not depend upon the nonlinear damping parameter."

D[L\u0302] is called the Lindblad dissipator having the form D[L\u0302](\u03c1) = L\u0302\u03c1L\u0302\u2020 \u2212 12{L\u0302 \u2020L\u0302, \u03c1}, where L\u0302 is an operator (without any loss of generality we set ~ = 1). The operator Oj of the second term (shown in underbrace) is introduced to bring the notion of active-inactive element (discussed in the next paragraph). In the classical limit, i.e., Gj > \u03ba, the master equation (3) is equivalent to the classical amplitude equation (1) by the relation: \u02d9\u3008a\u3009 = Tr(\u03c1\u0307a). Here \u2211\nj\u2032 \u2032 indicates that the sum does\nnot include the condition j\u2032 = j. Let us introduce the notion of active and inactive elements into the quantum master equation. We identify that this can be determined by the operator of the Lindblad dissipator associated with the coefficient Gj (shown\n3 in (3) in underbrace) in the following manner\nOj =\n \n\naj \u2020 for active oscillators,\naj for inactive oscillators.\nThat is for Oj = aj \u2020, the dissipatorGjD[Oj ](\u03c1) in Eq. (3) describes a single boson (e.g. photon, phonon, etc.) gain with a rate of Gj , therefore, it gives rise to a stable quantum limit cycle for the jth oscillator, making it a quantum active element. However, Oj = aj gives a single boson loss with a rate of Gj and the jth oscillator exhibits quantum non-oscillatory or inactive behavior. Similar to the case of classical system, the whole network is divided into two groups \u2014 one group consists of Na active elements and the other consists of Ni inactive elements (Ni = N \u2212Na). Also, as usual p = Ni N\ndenotes the fraction of inactive nodes present in the network. Eq.(3) was studied by Ishibashi and Kanamoto [30] in the context of quantum amplitude death, where all the oscillators were taken as active (i.e., Oj = aj\n\u2020): it was shown that a parameter mismatch among the coupled oscillators gives rise to quantum amplitude death. For the uncoupled state (V = 0), the Wigner-function phase space representation of active and inactive elements are shown in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b), respectively. The ring shaped Wigner function [43] of Fig. 2(a) represents a quantum limit cycle (Gj = 4, Oj = aj\n\u2020), i.e., an active element. A probability blob at the origin of Fig. 2(b) (with Gj = 2, Oj = aj) indicates that the element is non-self-oscillatory or inactive. The corresponding occupation probability distribution in Fock state are shown in Fig. 2 (c) (for active elements) and Fig. 2 (d) (for inactive elements). In the inactive element, indeed, ground state is the only occupied state, whereas, for the active element, higher Fock levels are more populated. For a large number of oscillators, one can factorize the density matrix of the many-body system as \u03c1 \u2248 \u2297Nj=1\u03c1j . This corresponds to the mean-field approximation and reduces the master equation Eq. (3) to a set of master equations for each oscillator interacting with the meanfield as follows [30]:\n\u03c1\u0307j = \u2212i[\u03c9aj \u2020aj , \u03c1j ] +GjD[Oj ](\u03c1j) + \u03baD[aj 2](\u03c1j)\n+ 2V (N \u2212 1)\nN D[aj ](\u03c1) + V\n( A[aj \u2020, \u03c1j ]\u2212A \u2217[aj , \u03c1j ] ) ,\n(4)\nwhere A and A\u2217 have the forms: A = 1 N \u2211\u2032N j\u2032=1 \u3008aj\u2032\u3009j and A\u2217 = 1 N \u2211\u2032N j\u2032=1 \u3008a \u2020 j\u2032 \u3009j .

As in the case of classical net-\nwork, here also we take Gj = 4 for the active elements [j \u2208 {1, 2, ..., Na}], and Gj = 2 for the inactive elements [j \u2208 {Na + 1, ..., N}]. In the network, we distinguish oscillatory and oscillation collapsed state by computing the mean boson number per oscillator: n\u0304mf = 1 N \u2211 j \u3008aj \u2020aj\u3009. Based on this, we define an order parameter, namely the normalized mean boson number\nQ = n\u0304mf(p)\nn\u0304mf(0) ,\nwhere, n\u0304mf(p) is the mean boson number per oscillator for a particular p value and n\u0304mf (0) is the same for p = 0.\n4 n P (n ) P (n ) 0 10 0 1 n n p=0.2 p=0.5 p=0.8 (a) Active (b) Active (c) Active (d) Inactive (e) Inactive (f) Inactive\nFIG. 4. Fock state distribution of boson numbers for active (upper row) and inactive (lower row) elements at different p values (coupling strength V = 5). (a,d) p = 0.2(< pcq), (b,e) p = 0.5(< pcq). (c,f) p = 0.8(> pcq). Note that for p > pcq, inactive oscillators go to the ground state, however, active oscillators still populate a few excited states. Other parameters are \u03c9 = 2 and \u03ba = 0.2.\nTo observe the variation of average mean boson number with increasing p value we plot Q with p in Fig. 3(a) for a set of coupling strength V . For V \u2264 2.73, Q decreases monotonically with increasing p that has a resemblance with the classical case (cf. Fig. 1). However, beyond a critical value of V \u2248 2.73, the decrement rate of Q shows two characteristic zones: in the first part Q decreases rapidly with increasing p, however, beyond a critical value pcq, the curve takes the form of an almost inclined straight line. We call the point on the curve separating the sharp fall and the inclined straight region as \u201cknee\u201d point. In Fig.3(a) the knee point of the curve corresponding to V = 5 is shown by a star mark on it. We consider these knee points as aging transition points and denote the p values corresponding to these knee points as pcq and the corresponding order parameter as Qc. With a further increment of p, the curve gradually approaches Q = 0 due to the presence of more and more inactive elements in the network. We get Q = 0 as p equals unity, which is a trivial case as now all the oscillators are inactive.\nThe variations of pcq and Qc with coupling strength V are shown in Fig. 3(b) and Fig. 3(c), respectively. Fig. 3(b) shows that pcq at first increases with increasing V , then for stronger coupling strength it does not change appreciably and gets saturated. This is unlike classical case, in which pc decreases with increasing coupling strength [7]. However, Qc decreases with increasing coupling strength, which is expected as strong coupling is conducive for aging.\nThe quantum aging scenario can be explained by carefully inspecting the Fock distribution. Fig. 4(a,d) shows the distribution of Fock states at a lower p value (p = 0.2) for active and inactive groups. Comparing this scenario with Fig. 2 (uncoupled case) one can observe that in the presence of coupling (V > Vc), at first inactive elements become oscillatory and the active elements become less\nFIG. 5. Two parameter plot of Q in V \u2212 p space. Inset: The variation of Q with V at p = 0.7 (along blue dashed horizontal line). The black square shows the critical value of V beyond which aging can take place. Other parameters are \u03c9 = 2 and \u03ba = 0.2.\nactive. With increasing p, amplitude of active and inactive oscillators decreases rapidly [see Fig. 4(b,e) for p = 0.5], which is manifested by the shift of probability distribution towards the ground state. Beyond the critical value pcq, active and inactive oscillators behave in a different manner: all the inactive oscillators now completely collapsed to the ground state [see Fig. 4(f)], however, the active oscillators do not completely go to the ground state, rather a few lower level states near the ground state are still populated [see Fig. 4(e)]. This can be understood from the nature of dissipator associated with active and inactive oscillators in Eq. (3). For the inactive oscillators, the dissipator (in the under brace) contains a single boson absorption term, which allows for a complete relaxation to the ground state. However, for active elements, damping is governed only by two photon absorption process, which does not allow a complete relaxation of the system to the ground state.\nNext, we present the quantum aging scenario in the V \u2212p space by visualizing the variation of the normalized order parameterQ (shown in Fig. 5). The plot shows that up to a certain value of coupling strength V (shown by a square mark on the V -axis), no aging transition occurs; beyond this value of V the aging transition occurs with increasing p. Choosing p = 0.7, we plot Q \u2212 V (along the horizontal line of Fig. 5), which is shown in the inset of Fig. 5. It shows that beyond a critical value of V , the order parameter Q decreases with V .\nIn the classical case, aging transition does not depend upon the nonlinear damping parameter \u03ba. However, in stark contrast, we find that in the quantum case, \u03ba very much controls the quantum aging transition. Fig. 6 demonstrates the variation of Q with p for three different exemplary values of \u03ba (V = 5): it shows that a large \u03ba induces quantum aging at a lower p value. The variation of pcq with \u03ba in the inset supports this fact. Also note that larger \u03ba results in a greater Qc value, i.e., nonlinearity degrades the quality of aging in the quantum aging transition. This can be attributed to the fact that,\n5 0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1\n0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1\nQ\np\n\u03ba=0.2 \u03ba=0.6\n\u03ba=1\n0 0.1 0.5 1\np c q ,\nQ c\n\u03ba\npcq Qc\nV\n0.5\n1\nFIG. 6.

            "text": "In this paper we have studied the quantum mechanical analog of aging transition. We have considered a network of active and inactive quantum oscillators and using a mean-boson number based order parameter we have demonstrated the quantum version of the aging transition. The following are the key observations that make quantum aging transition different from its classical counterpart. First, unlike classical case, the quantum aging transition is not manifested by the complete collapse of the network but by rapid decrease in the average mean\nboson number. Second, the quantum aging has two distinct processes associated with it: up to a critical \u201cknee\u201d point, the order parameter decreases rapidly, however, beyond that the rate of decrement slows down. In the second part all the inactive elements populate the ground state, which is allowed by the single boson loss process. However, here active oscillators never completely populate the ground state, because for them relaxation is governed by the two-boson absorption process only. This scenario has no classical counterpart and makes the quantum aging process unique. Third, unlike classical aging transition, quantum aging depends upon the nonlinear damping process. We have shown that a strong nonlinear damping makes the aging process weaker. We attribute this to the population of a few excited states in the presence of strong nonlinear damping that does not change appreciably by aging. The study can be implemented in experiments by realizing one boson loss (for inactive elements), one boson gain (for active elements), and two boson absorption process (for both active and inactive nodes). With the advancement of current quantum technology, we believe that trapped-ion set ups and optomechanical systems can provide a feasible experimental platform for verifying the results. Our study has revealed that the presence of a few inactive (or aged) elements in a quantum network may lead to system dysfunction or collapse. Therefore, sufficient measures have to be taken to avoid node degradation due to possible losses [46, 47]."
