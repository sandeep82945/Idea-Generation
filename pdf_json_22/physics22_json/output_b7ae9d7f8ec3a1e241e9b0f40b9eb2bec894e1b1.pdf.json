We investigate the mass spectrum and electromagnetic transitions of charmonia, emphasizing the instanton effects on them. The heavy-quark potential consists of a Coulomblike potential from one-gluon exchange and a linear confining potential. We introduce the nonperturbative heavy-quark potential derived from the instanton vacuum. We also consider the screened confining potential, which better describes the electromagnetic decays of higher excited states. Using this improved heavy-quark potential, we compute the mass spectrum and electromagnetic decays of charmonia. Focusing on the instanton effects, we discuss the results compared with the experimental data and those from other works. The instanton effects are marginal on the electromagnetic decays of charmonia. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .",

            "text": "Quarkonium is a simple and yet crucial hadron system that consists of one heavy quark and one heavy antiquark. Since it is very heavy, a nonrelativistic (NR) approach is suitable for describing its structure and properties. Moreover, accurate measurements of masses and radiative decay widths for low-lying quarkonia provide a precision test of any theory based on perturbative and nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics (see reviews on quarkonia [1\u20134]). Quarkonia have successfully been described by quantum mechanical potential models [5,6]. The static heavy-quark potential consists of two main contributions: the Coulomb-like term and the phenomenological quark-confining one. The former arises from one-gluon exchange (OGE) between a heavy quark (Q) and a heavy antiquark (Q), based on perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) [7\u201310]. Higher-order corrections from pQCD were also considered [11\u201315]. Since OGE comes from pQCD, the Coulomb-like potential governs the short-range dynamics inside charmonia. It should fade away with the distance between heavy and anti-heavy quarks and then will be taken over by the effects of quark confinement [16]. The heavy-quark potential for the quark confinement can be derived phenomenologically from the Wilson loop, which increases monotonically as the distance between heavy quarks increases [5,6].\nC\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

The nonperturbative heavy-quark potential was derived from the instanton vacuum [17] and was examined by computing the charmonium spectra [18,19]. While the instanton effects on the heavy-quark potential are small, they provide significant physical implications. Firstly, the heavy quark acquires an additional dynamical mass from the instantons, i.e., MI 70 MeV [17\u201320], which allows one to use the value of the heavy-quark mass close to the physical one in the heavy-quark potential. Secondly, an additional contribution from the instantons makes it possible to employ the value of the strong coupling constant near the charm-quark mass scale. Note that the strong coupling constant used in the Coulomb-like potential has often been overestimated [21\u201323]. In addition to the instanton effects, we want to modify the linear confining potential. When the 1/mQ corrections are considered where mQ is the heavy-quark mass, the heavy quark is no longer static. The light quark\u2013antiquark pair will be created from the vacuum at a certain scale (\u223c1 fm). Furthermore, the created quark\u2013antiquark pair will screen the color charge [24,25]. The screened confining potential has been adopted to describe the electromagnetic (EM) decays of charmonia [23,26]. While the EM transitions of charmonia have been extensively studied within various theoretical frameworks such as the heavy-quark potential models [21,23,27], lattice QCD [26,28\u201333], QCD sum rules [34\u201336], Bethe\u2013Salpeter equations [37,38], potential NR QCD (pNRQCD) [39,40], and quark models [41\u201345], the EM decays of higher excited charmonium states are not fully understood theoretically.\nIn the present work, we want to extend the previous works and examine the instanton effects on the charmonium spectrum and EM transitions of charmonia. This paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, we briefly explain how the heavy-quark potential is derived from the instanton vacuum. In Sect. 3, we reproduce the mass spectrum of charmonia with the introduction of a new type of confining potential. In Sect. 4, we derive the spin-dependent part of the heavyquark potential. In Sect. 5, we discuss the results for the charmonium spectrum and EM decay rates. The final section is devoted to the summary and conclusion."

Nonperturbative heavy-quark potential The heavy-quark potential can be defined by the Wilson loop as shown in Fig. 1.\nDiakonov et al. [17] derived the central part of the nonperturbative heavy-quark potential, regarding an instanton packing parameter \u03bb = \u03c1\u03044/R4(\u223c 0.01) as an expansion parameter, where \u03c1\u0304 denotes the average instanton size and R the instanton inter-distance that is represented as R = N/V. In the instanton liquid model, the number of instantons N and the 4D volume V give N/V (200 MeV)4 and \u03c1\u0304 (600 MeV)\u22121 1/3 fm [46\u201348]. The gluon field A\u03bc(x) in Euclidean space can be decomposed into classical (A) and quantum (B) parts,\nA\u03bc(x) = A\u03bc(x, \u03be ) + B\u03bc(x), (1) where the classical background field A\u03bc(x, \u03be ) is given by the summation over all (anti-)instanton fields A\u03bc(x, \u03be ) = \u2211 iAi\u03bc(x, \u03be i). Here, \u03be i = (zi, Ui, \u03c1 i) denote collective coordinates: the instanton positions zi, the color orientations Ui, and the sizes of the instantons \u03c1 i.

In this limit, one can ignore the spatial line because r is very small compared to T.\nber of colors) limit, the width of the instanton distribution is of order 1/Nc, so the instanton distributions can be approximated by the delta functions. Thus, \u03c1 i is just the average size of the instanton \u03c1\u0304, \u03c1i = \u03c1\u0304. The instanton field A\u00b1, \u03bc in the singular gauge is expressed as\nA\u00b1,\u03bc(x, z\u00b1) = \u03b7\u2213\u03bc\u03bd (x \u2212 z\u00b1)\u03bc\u03bba\u03c1\u03042\n(x \u2212 z\u00b1)2((x \u2212 z\u00b1)2 + \u03c1\u03042) , (2)\nwhere \u03b7\u2213\u03bc\u03bd stand for the \u2019t Hooft symbols:\n\u03b7\u00b1a\u03bc\u03bd = \u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8 \u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9 a\u03bc\u03bd : \u03bc, \u03bd = 1, 2, 3 \u2213\u03b4a\u03bd : \u03bc = 4 \u00b1\u03b4a\u03bc : \u03bd = 4 0 : \u03bc, \u03bd = 4 . (3)\nHere, the + and \u2212 signs designate respectively the instanton and the anti-instanton. Note that the heavy-quark and antiquark correlator is just the same as the Wilson loop [49]. Considering that the instanton medium is dilute, we can average over the pseudoparticles (instantons and anti-instantons) independently. Thus, the average of the Wilson loop over the pseudoparticles can be expressed as\nw \u2261 \u3008\u3008W \u3009\u3009 = \u222b d\u03be 1\nD(1) 1 D(2) , (4)\nwhere d\u03be = V\u22121\u220fi = 1dzidUi stands for the measure of the zero modes and D(i) is the inverse of the heavy-quark propagator expressed by D(i) = \u03b8\u22121 \u2212\u2211I a(i)I . The double angle brackets represent the ensemble average over the pseudoparticles [17]. \u03b8 designates the inverse of the time derivative d/dt: \u3008t|\u03b8 |t\u2032 \u3009 = \u03b8 (t \u2212 t\u2032) with the Heaviside step function \u03b8 (t \u2212 t\u2032). a(i)I represents a(i)I = iA(i)I,\u03bc(\u03be )x\u0307\u03bc(t), which is aligned along the tangential direction to the Wilson line. The superscripts in Eq. (4) denote the corresponding Wilson lines as shown in Fig. 1. After the integral over the color orientations and using the Pobylitsa equation [50], we obtain the inverse of the Wilson loop in powers of N/VNc:\nw\u22121 = \u03b8\u22121\u03b8\u22121 + N 2V Nc Trc \u2211 \u00b1 \u222b d4z\u00b1\n\u00d7 [ \u03b8\u22121\u03b8\u22121 \u2212 \u03b8\u22121w(1)\u00b1 \u03b8\u22121\u03b8\u22121w(2)\u00b1 \u03b8\u22121 ] + O\n(( N\n2V Nc\n)2) , (5)\n3/15\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ptep/article/2022/10/103D 02/6731797 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nwhere Trc is the trace over color space. w\u00b1 is defined as\nw\u00b1 = (\u03b8\u22121 \u2212 a\u00b1)\u22121.

In the infinite time limit T \u2192 \u221e, the heavy-quark potential is defined by the Wilson loop as follows:\u2329 t(1)1 |w|t(2)1 \u232a \u2248 exp [\u2212VIT ] , (8)\nwhere VI denotes the instanton-induced potential. Then VI is derived as\nVI (r) = N2V Nc \u2211 \u00b1 \u222b d3z\u00b1\n\u00d7 Trc [ 1 \u2212 P exp ( i \u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e dx4A\u00b1,4\n) P exp ( i \u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e dy4A\u00b1,4\n)] . (9)\n2.2. Spin-dependent potential So far, we have obtained the static heavy-quark potential from the instanton vacuum. However, we need to consider the spin-dependent correction to obtain the mass splitting in charmonia. In this section we will briefly show how the spin-dependent parts can be constructed from the central Coulomb-like and confining potentials. We can obtain them by using the Fermi\u2013Breit equation [2,51]:\nVSD(r) = VSS(r)SQ \u00b7 SQ\u0304 + VLS(r)L \u00b7 S + VT (r)[3(SQ \u00b7 n\u0302)(SQ\u0304 \u00b7 n\u0302) \u2212 SQ \u00b7 SQ\u0304], (10)\nwhere the spin-dependent potential VSD can be expressed by three terms, i.e., the spin\u2013spin interaction VSS, the spin\u2013orbit interaction VLS, and the tensor interaction VT. The radial parts of Eq. (10) are expressed as\nVSS(r) = 2 3m2Q \u22072Vv = 32\u03c0\u03b1s 9m2Q \u03b4(r), (11)\nVLS(r) = 1 2m2Qr\n( 3\ndVv dr \u2212 dVs dr\n) , (12)\nVT (r) = 1 3m2Q ( 1 r dVv dr \u2212 d 2Vs dr2 ) , (13)\nwhere Vv and Vs denote the Coulomb-like potential and the confining potential, respectively. The spin-dependent potentials appear from the next-to-leading order in powers of 1/m2Q. The Dirac delta function \u03b4 in Eq. (11) should be smeared by the Gaussian form to avoid a singular behavior of the spin\u2013spin potential\n\u03b4\u0303(r) = (\n\u03c3\u221a \u03c0\n)3 e\u2212\u03c3 2r2, (14)\nwhere \u03c3 is a smearing parameter.\n4/15\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ptep/article/2022/10/103D 02/6731797 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nThe instanton-induced spin-dependent potential is derived from the Wilson line in the nextto-leading order of 1/m2Q. The Wilson line in Fig. 1 is expressed as\nW (x, y; A) = W0(x, y; A) \u2212 \u222b d4zW0(x, z; A)\n\u00d7 [ i /D\u22a5 1\niv \u00b7 D + 2mQ i /D\u22a5\n] W (z, y; A), (15)\nwhere\nW0(x, y; A) = P exp ( i \u222b y4\nx4 A4dz4\n) \u03b4(3)(x \u2212 y). (16)\nIn the rest frame, the four-velocity v\u03bc is written as\nv\u03bc = (1, 0), /D\u22a5 = \u03b3 iDi (i = 1, 2, 3), (17)\nwhere D\u03bc is a covariant derivative that is defined as D\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u2212 igA\u03bc. If we expand the inside of the square bracket of Eq.

Since it is inconvenient and cumbersome to deal with Eq. (28) in a practical calculation, we introduce an interpolation function described in Refs. [19,49]. I in Eq. (28) is interpolated by the following form:\nI(x) = I0 { 1 + 2\u2211\ni=1\n[ aix2(i\u22121) + a3(\u2212b3x)i ] e\u2212bix\n2 + a3 x\n( 1 \u2212 e\u2212b3x2 )} , (29)\nwhich is reduced to the asymptotic forms at r = 0 and r \u2192 \u221e as follows: I(0) = 0, I(\u221e) = I0 (30)\nwith the parameters I0, ai, and bi [49]:\nI0 = 4.416 25\na = \u239b \u239c\u239d \u221210.128 702\n\u22121.1047\n\u239e \u239f\u23a0 , b = \u239b \u239c\u239d0.404 8750.453 923\n0.420 733\n\u239e \u239f\u23a0 .

(33) Here, VCand Vs designate the Coulomb-like and confining potentials, respectively. The linear potential (LP) has often been used for Vs [18,21\u201323,55,56], since it arises from Wilson\u2019s area law [16]. However, when a quark continues to separate from an antiquark, the string connecting them will be broken at a certain scale and a light quark\u2013antiquark pair will be created from the vacuum. The LP does not explain this feature of the quark confinement. This makes it difficult to explain the EM transitions for excited states of charmonia quantitatively. Thus, the strong screened potential for Vs was used in Ref. [23], which is saturated as r increases. In the current work, we revise the strong screened potential by introducing a Gaussian function, expressed as Vs(r) = k(1 \u2212 e\u2212br2 )/b, (34) which provides a better description of the EM transitions in the presence of the instantoninduced heavy-quark potential. To solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, we use the variational method that minimizes the eigenvalues with the six experimental values of the charmonium masses used as input. Minimizing the eigenvalues, we determine the fitting parameters listed in Table 1. Model I is constructed by excluding the instanton-induced potential, whereas Model II is built by including it. We want to emphasize that, with the instanton-induced potential and the confining one given in Eq. (34), we can use a value of the one-loop running strong coupling constant close to the physical one at the charm-quark mass scale, which is given by\n\u03b1s(\u03bc) = 4\u03c0 \u03b20\n1 ln ( \u03bc2/ 2QCD ) , (35) where \u03b20 = (11Nc \u2212 2Nf)/3, QCD = 0.217 GeV [57], and the scale \u03bc \u2248 mc. If \u03bc is fixed at the charm-quark mass \u03bc \u2248 mc = 1.275 GeV, then \u03b1s(\u03bc) = 0.4258. Note that this value is closer to that used in the instanton liquid model (see Table 1).\nIt is of great interest to compare the heavy-quark potential with the instanton effects to the phenomenological potential [21] and that derived from lattice QCD [58]. We draw the central and spin\u2013spin potentials respectively in Figs. 3 and 4. The potentials used for Model I and Model II are illustrated by solid and dashed curves, whereas those from the NR model and lattice QCD are shown by short-dashed and dot\u2013dashed ones, respectively. The parameters used in the NR approach [21] and lattice QCD [58] are given in Table 2.

The confining potential employed in Model I and Model II is defined in Eq. (34), whereas the NR model and lattice QCD use the linear type Vs = \u03bar.\nIn both Model I and the NR approach, the spin\u2013spin potential given in Eq. (11) is used, whereas in Model II we also have Eq. (25). On the other hand, in lattice QCD the following\n9/15\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ptep/article/2022/10/103D 02/6731797 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nform of the spin\u2013spin potential is adopted:\nVSS = A exp(\u2212Br2). (37)\nWe have extracted the values of mc and \u03c3 in lattice QCD by comparing Eqs. (11) and (37). One can see that the central parts of all the four potentials in Fig. 3 are more or less the same\nat small distances. Only at large distances do the potentials in Model I and II become slightly lower than those used in the NR approach and lattice QCD on account of the screening effect in Eq. (34). The spin\u2013spin part of the present one is similar to that from the NR model but becomes much larger than that from lattice QCD.\nAs mentioned already, we use six different values of the charmonium masses as input, denoted by asterisks in the second column of Table 3. Though, in general, the instanton-induced potential provides a marginal contribution to the masses of charmonia, they still improve the numerical results, compared to the experimental data."

On the other hand, they hardly contribute at all to its decay to \u03c7 c0 and hc and are in good agreement with the data.\nTable 5 lists the results for the E1 transition from the 1P to 1S states. In contrast to the E1 transitions for 2S \u2192 1P decays, the instanton effects slightly enhance the decay widths. The decay widths for \u03c7 cJ(1P) \u2192 J/\u03c8(1S) are well described by the present heavy-quark potential. That for hc(1P) \u2192 \u03b7c(1S) is overestimated compared with the data.\nIn Table 6, we present the results for the 1D \u2192 1P decay widths. The decay rates for \u03c8(13D1) \u2192 \u03c7 c0, c1(13P0, 1) are overestimated compared with the data.

Note that the \u03c8(3770) resonance lies just above the open-charm DD\u0304 threshold. This implies that the light quarks may come into play. Furthermore, the 13D1 state \u03c8(3770) is assumed to be mixed with a small 23S1 state [59,60]. One can improve the results by considering the light-quark contributions and S\u2013D mixing. Since \u03c8(3770) is above the DD\u0304 threshold, relativistic corrections may also be important. However, since we are focusing on the effects of the heavy-quark potential from the instanton vacuum in the current work, we have not considered them.\nIn Table 7, we list the results for the decay rates for the M1 transition. Though the results describe the experimental data well, the instanton effects are again negligibly small."

            "text": "In the current work, we examined the instanton effects on the mass spectrum and electromagnetic transitions of charmonia. We briefly reviewed the heavy-quark potential from the instanton vacuum. To improve the results, we introduced a new type of confining potential. We utilized experimental data for the masses of six different charmonia to fit the data. Though the instanton effects are marginal on the mass spectrum of charmonia, they allow one to use smaller values of the strong coupling constant and the charm-quark mass, which are closer to the physical values compared to other works. Using the effective Hamiltonian for the quark\u2013 photon electromagnetic interaction, we derived radiative decay rates for the E1 and M1 transitions. The instanton heavy-quark potential has generally minor effects on the radiative decays of charmonia."
