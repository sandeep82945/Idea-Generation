    "abstractText": "Lung carcinoids (LCs) comprise well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors classified as typical (TCs) and atypical (ACs) carcinoids. Unfortunately, curative therapies remain elusive for metastatic LCs, which account for 25\u201330% of cases. This study evaluated the antitumor activity of axitinib (AXI), a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor selectively targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3) in human lung TC (NCI-H727, UMC-11, NCI-H835) and AC (NCI-H720) cell lines. In vitro and in vivo (zebrafish) assays were performed following AXI treatment to gather several read-outs about cell viability, cell cycle, the secretion of proangiogenic factors, apoptosis, tumor-induced angiogenesis and migration. AXI demonstrated relevant antitumor activity in human LC cells, with pronounced effects observed in UMC-11 and NCIH720, characterized by cell cycle perturbation and apoptosis induction. AXI significantly hindered tumor induced-angiogenesis in Tg(fli1a:EGFP)y1 zebrafish embryos implanted with all LC cell lines and also reduced the invasiveness of NCI-H720 cells, as well as the secretion of several proangiogenic factors. In conclusion, our study provides initial evidence supporting the potential anti-tumor activity of AXI in LC, offering a promising basis for future investigations in mammalian animal models and, eventually, progressing to clinical trials.",

            "text": "Lung carcinoids (LCs) are neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) that comprise welldifferentiated typical (TCs) and atypical carcinoids (ACs) classified as low- and intermediate-\nCancers 2023, 15, 5375. https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15225375 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cancers\nCancers 2023, 15, 5375 2 of 16\ngrade NETs (G1 and G2), respectively [1,2]. Surgical resection represents the mainstay treatment for localized TC and AC. Although LCs are generally less aggressive than other primary lung tumors, approximately 25\u201330% of patients, especially those with AC, develop distant metastases. Since curative therapies are not available for metastatic forms, there is an urgent need for new treatment options [3\u20138]. LCs express a plethora of growth factors and their relative receptors that can promote tumor progression by stimulating angiogenesis and metastasis formation [9,10]. A high expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been correlated with a relevant angiogenesis as well as decreased progression-free survival in patients with low-grade NETs, such as LCs [11]. VEGF receptors (VEGFR-1, -2 and -3) are highly expressed in LCs, suggesting that the autocrine activation of the VEGF pathway may promote tumor growth as observed in other NETs [12,13]. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that VEGR-2 and -3 are more expressed in TC and AC than in other lung cancers [13]. Other tyrosine kinase receptors, such as stem cell factor receptors (c-kit), endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR)-\u03b1 and, PDGFR-\u03b2 have been identified in a significant number of patients with metastatic LCs and in LC cell lines [12,14\u201318]. In light of the heterogeneity in the expression of growth factors and related receptors in LCs, several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been evaluated for the treatment of LCs [15,19\u201321]. In this context, it is valuable to explore other TKIs that have shown effectiveness in treating different types of tumors as potential candidates for managing LCs. Axitinib (AXI) is a potent and selective TKI of VEGFR-1, -2 and -3 [22] that received approval by the European Medicines Agency in 2015 for the treatment of advanced renal carcinoma after a failure of prior treatment with sunitinib or interleukin 2 [23]. Moreover, AXI has been tested as second-line therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer [24,25]. An open-label, two-stage design, phase II trial showed an inhibitory effect of AXI on tumor growth in patients with progressive unresectable/metastatic low-tointermediate-grade NETs [26]. In this study, we characterized the antitumor activity of AXI on human lung TC (NCIH727, UMC-11, NCI-H835) and AC (NCI-H720) cell lines by collecting both in vitro and in vivo read outs."

Subsequently, they were implanted with human LC cell lines, as previously described [30,31]. Briefly, tumor cells were labelled with a red fluorescent viable dye (CellTrackerTM CM-DiI Dye, Invitrogen\u2122 Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The labelled cells were resuspended in PBS, and then grafted (about 100\u20131000 cells per embryo) into the sub-peridermal space of Tg(fli1a: EGFP)y1 embryos, close to the sub-intestinal vein (SIV) plexus. The injections were carried out using a micro-injector FemtoJet (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), equipped with a micromanipulator InjectMan NI 2 (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). All implanted embryos were raised at 32 \u25e6C, which served as a compromise temperature between the optimal temperature for zebrafish maintenance (28 \u25e6C) and the optimal temperature for mammalian cell growth and metabolism (37 \u25e6C). After the implantation, zebrafish embryos were exposed to AXI treatment for up to 48 h with AXI being dissolved into fish medium. As control for the pharmacological treatment, we included grafted embryos incubated in the fish water and the vehicle in which the experimental substance was dissolved (DMSO). This transplantable platform was employed to assess the AXI effects on tumorinduced angiogenesis and the spread of tumor cells. The pro-angiogenic and migratory response of injected tumor cells were monitored in vivo by means of an epifluorescence stereomicroscope Leica M205 FA equipped with a digital camera Leica DFC 450 C and using the LAS software (4.2.0 version, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). As an arbitrary unit of tumor-induced angiogenesis at 24 h post injection (hpi), we calculated in each imaged embryo the EGFP area corresponding to endothelial structures that sprouted from the SIV plexus by using Fiji software (version 2.9.0/14 September 2022) [32]. The presence of tumor cell clusters far from the injection site, in the tail region, was detected via fluorescence microscopy and quantified using the \u201cAnalyze Particle\u201d tool of Fiji software at 0 (immediately after the injection) and 48 hpi."

Due to the permeability of embryonic tissue to small molecules, AXI was directly dissolved in the fish medium. Two different concentrations were tested, 0.25 and 2.5 \u00b5M, based on preliminary pharmacological experiments on Tg(fli1a:EGFP)y1 embryos without tumor xenograft, aimed at detecting the toxicity range of the drug and minimizing the occurrence of morphological abnormalities.\nFigure 4.

In this context, there is an urgent need for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. AXI is a potent, selective second-generation inhibitor of VEGFRs, approved in many countries as a second-line treatment of advanced renal-cell carcinoma [22,23]. An open-label, two-stage design, phase II trial of AXI in patients with progressive unresectable/metastatic low-to-intermediate-grade NETs showed an inhibitory effect of AXI on tumor growth. In this study, only 3 out of 30 enrolled patients presented LCs [26]. Thus far, few data have been published about the anti-tumor activity of AXI in LC preclinical models. Wang and co-workers showed that AXI significantly inhibited cell growth in both 2D and 3D culture models of NCI-H727 after 6 days of incubation [36]. In the present preclinical study, we combined in vitro and in vivo approaches to evaluate the antitumor activity of AXI on a broad number of commercially available LC cell lines, including three human TC (NCI-H727, UMC-11 and NCI-H835) and one AC cell line (NCI-H720). It is important to note that while immortalized cell lines may not fully recapitulate the complexity and heterogeneity of LCs, obtaining primary cultures of these neoplasms is challenging due to several factors, including small tissue samples, the low proliferation rate of tumor cells, and the rarity of LC. In our in vitro experiments AXI was able to significantly decrease the viability rate of all human LC cell lines after 6 days of incubation, especially in UMC-11 and NCIH720 cells. Furthermore, the antitumor activity of this TKI was modulated by the induction of apoptosis/necrosis and cell cycle arrest. Nowadays, no data are available about the effects of this compound on cell cycle and apoptosis in lung NETs. In two TC (NCI-H727, UMC-11) and AC (NCI-H720) cell lines, AXI significantly decreased the percentages of cells in G0/G1 and S phase and promoted the accumulation of cells in G2/M phase. This effect was extremely relevant in UMC-11 and NCI-H720 cells. A cell cycle perturbation of LC cells after incubation with AXI has also been confirmed by the increased expression of p21Waf1/Cip1, a protein that controls cell cycle progression and negatively regulates cellular proliferation, being involved in p53-dependent G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest [37,38]. Moreover, AXI exerted a prominent pro-apoptotic activity in LC cell lines, especially in NCI-H720, as detected via staining with Annexin V/PI and analyzed via FACS, and increased caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. The cleaved PARP-1 (89 kDa, C-terminal fragment) is indeed considered a signal of a point of no return in the late-stage of apoptosis [39]. Notably, when cells encounter genomic instability due to DNA damage, PARP-1 initiates the repair machinery. However, if the extent of DNA damage exceeds the\nCancers 2023, 15, 5375 12 of 16\ncell\u2019s repair capacity, PARP-1 is cleaved by caspases-3. Despite the limitation of the use of immortalized cell lines, future examinations can be beneficial to better understand cell death mechanisms induced by this TKI in LC. Specifically, further investigations should focus on the NCI-H835 cell line, which exhibited a higher resistance compared to other cell lines. NETs are highly vascularized neoplasms. Several studies reported that welldifferentiated NETs are hyper-vascularized with respect to poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas [40\u201343]. In this context, high vascular density is more likely to be a marker of differentiation than a marker of aggressiveness, as usually appearing in other carcinomas. This phenomenon, named as the \u201cneuro-endocrine paradox\u201d, has been mainly described in gastroenteropancreatic NETs, but it has also been reported in lung NETs [44,45]. Indeed, it has been described that serum levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), VEGF and VEGFR-1 were significantly higher in patients with carcinoid tumors versus the healthy control group, and only VEGFR-1 levels closely correlated with TNM classification [46]. Mairinger and co-workers demonstrated that VEGR-2 and -3, as well as c-fos-induced growth factory, an activator of VEGFRs, were more expressed in TC and AC than in other lung NETs [13]. In order to further investigate the antitumor activity of AXI, we analyzed in vivo its effects on tumor-induced angiogenesis and tumor cell dissemination, exploiting the procedure of the tumor xenotransplantation in zebrafish embryos. While murine models are widely regarded as the gold standard for tumor xenografts, zebrafish embryos emerged as a valuable alternative model due to their peculiar advantages and their adherence to the principles of the 3Rs. Zebrafish transparency during embryonic stages allows for a real-time observation of tumor growth and progression, tumor\u2013host interactions, tumor-induced angiogenesis and migration. Tumor implantation in zebrafish embryos can overcome some relevant drawbacks reported in mice. For instance, the maintenance costs of a zebrafish facility are lower compared to those of mice, and their management is straightforward. The response to tumor implantation in zebrafish embryos, in terms of proangiogenic effects of implanted cells or their metastatic behavior, can be readily observed in real-time and only after 24 hpi, a time window narrower than that required in mice, ranging from weeks to months. Immunosuppression is not required because zebrafish embryos do not possess a fully developed immune system, preventing graft rejection at this stage of development. Furthermore, zebrafish offer the possibility to study the effects of small tumor implants (100\u20131000 cells/embryo) compared to the larger implants (about 1 million cells) required in murine models [47]. Another crucial aspect to emphasize is the conservation of tumor-induced angiogenesis between zebrafish and humans in terms of key signaling pathways and molecular players, such as VEGF and its receptors. Studies using zebrafish have demonstrated its utility in evaluating the effectiveness of anti-angiogenic drugs and identifying potential therapeutic agents for inhibiting tumorinduced angiogenesis. The results obtained from zebrafish experiments often correlate with those from human studies, underscoring the predictive value of this model organism in cancer research [48]. Furthermore, tumor xenografts in zebrafish embryos provide a valuable platform to perform the drug screening of new anticancer molecules. Due to the permeability of zebrafish embryos to small molecules (i.e., TKI), these drugs can be directly added to the embryo water. This makes zebrafish transplantable models suitable for the preliminary high-throughput screening of anti-cancer drugs, which can help reduce costs before moving on to more expensive mammalian models. While tumor xenografts in zebrafish embryos offer several advantages, it is important to acknowledge certain potential limitations. For instance, zebrafish embryos are maintained at 28 \u25e6C, which may not provide the optimal temperature for the growth and metabolism of mammalian cells. Additionally, the absence of some mammalian organs in fish, such as the mammary gland, prostate, and lung, restricts the possibility of performing orthotopic transplantations as seen in mouse models. Furthermore, although embryonic organs and systems are well-defined, their differentiation remains incomplete in embryos. This, coupled with physiological differences\nCancers 2023, 15, 5375 13 of 16\nbetween fish and mammals, may influence drug metabolism in zebrafish, potentially leading to variations compared to mammalian systems [47]. Regarding LCs, we have recently [33] provided evidence of the validity of zebrafish embryo xenotransplantation for studying angiogenesis and migration in this group of tumors. Interestingly, we observed a strong tumor-induced angiogenesis in embryos implanted with TC cell lines, with respect to those implanted with AC cells, which displayed a higher ability to spread along the embryo body. These data confirmed the neuroendocrine paradox in this preclinical model and strongly suggested that the zebrafish model faithfully recapitulates the tumor behavior of LCs in humans [33]. We exploited our zebrafish platform to assess the effectiveness of AXI, focusing on its anti-angiogenic and anti-migratory properties. Within just 24 h, AXI strongly inhibited tumor-induced angiogenesis, particularly in embryos injected with UMC-11 cells. This result is intriguing, considering our in vitro observations of a remarkable inhibition of UMC-11 viability after AXI exposure. The heightened sensitivity of UMC-11 cells to AXI treatment, compared to other LC cell lines, may be attributed to their distinct pattern of secreted factors. Notably, UMC-11 cells were found to secrete the highest concentration of VEGF among LC cells, as quantified in the conditioned medium via the ELISA test (Figure S1), suggesting a pivotal role of the VEGF system in their survival. Interestingly, AXI treatment led to a significant reduction in the secretion of several pro-angiogenic factors (VEGF, FGF-1, PDGF-AA, Angiopoietin 1 and 2) in LC cell lines after 24 h of incubation. However, VEGF secretion was significantly inhibited only in UMC-11 cells after AXI (Figure 7a). In this context, AXI could be particularly effective in UMC-11 cells by inhibiting both VEGFR activation and VEGF secretion. Moreover, it is noteworthy that AXI inhibited tumor cell invasiveness only in zebrafish embryos implanted with NCI-H720. With respect to the AXI concentrations used in our experiments, it is worth noting that they fall within the same order of magnitude as the reported Cmax in patients with advanced renal-cell carcinoma (27.8 ng/mL, corresponding to 0.72 \u00d7 10\u22127 M) [49]. Specifically, in the MTT and MTS assays, we observed that AXI concentrations, similar to the reported Cmax, significantly and moderately inhibited cell viability. Notably, in the context of tumor-induced angiogenesis, AXI concentrations near the Cmax demonstrated a more substantial effect, leading to a reduction in tumor-induced angiogenesis of up to 50% (Figure S2). Axitinib is generally well-tolerated at these concentrations, with a safety profile expected for this class of agents. Common adverse events include hypertension, fatigue, and diarrhea [49]."
