These disorders are mainly classified based on the role of insulin in them as the main hormone in regulating blood glucose2. In the insulin-dependent type (type 1), there are disorders in the insulin secretory cells, and in the non-insulin-dependent type (type 2), the body resists against the effect of insulin3. The most common type of DM is type 2 that associated with postprandial hyperglycemia. Commonly, postprandial hyperglycemia is markedly increased in diabetic patients with fasting hyperglycemia4. Therefore, the most important concern in regulating blood glucose in these patients is postprandial hyperglycemia regulation5. After eating, carbohydrates in food were hydrolyzed into glucose by two main groups of enzymes: \u03b1-amylase in the pancreas that converts polysaccharides to oligosaccharides and disaccharides and \u03b1-glucosidase in the intestine that converts oligosaccharides and disaccharides to glucose (Fig.\u00a01)6. Among these two enzymes, inhibition of \u03b1-glucosidase has\nOPEN\n1School of Chemistry, College of Science, University of Tehran, PO Box 14155-6455, Tehran, Iran. 2Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. 3Cellular and Molecular Biology Research Center, Health Research Institute, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran. 4Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. 5Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinical Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. 6Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine Research"

It should be noted, most \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors which are available today as diabetes medicine, can also inhibit \u03b1-amylase, and therefore specific \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors are probably more tolerable8. On the other hand, the potent and safe \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors can be useful in the treatment of obesity and other \u03b1-glucosidase related diseases9\u201311.\nPhthalimide is an important chemical structure in the design of new bioactive compounds12. This scaffold having various pharmacological activities including anticonvulsant, anticancer, antimicrobial, antiviral, and antidiabetic properties13\u201317. Phthalimide scaffold also was applied in the design of several series of the synthetic \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors18\u201320. On the other hand, one of the other pharmacophores that in the design of new potent \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors was applied is benzenesulfonamide19,21. Therefore, in continuation of our ongoing research on introducing new hybrid compounds with significant inhibitory activity against \u03b1-glucosidase, herein, we designed and synthesized a new series of phthalimide-benzenesulfonamide hybrids 4a\u2013n. These compounds were evaluated against \u03b1-glucosidase in\u00a0vitro and in silico. In\u00a0vitro \u03b1-amylase inhibition assay of these compounds was also performed."

In\u00a0vitro \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition assay of the all synthesized compounds, in\u00a0vitro anti-\u03b1amylase assay of the potent compounds against \u03b1-glucosidase, and kinetic analysis of the most potent entry were performed. In silico molecular modeling, molecular dynamics, and druglikeness/ADME/Toxicity profile of these compounds were also evaluated.\nChemistry. The synthetic route for the preparation of phthalimide-benzenesulfonamide derivatives 4a\u2013n has been depicted in Scheme\u00a01. As can be seen in Scheme\u00a01, N-propargylphthalimide 1 reacted with secondary amine derivatives 2a\u2013e and benzenesulfonyl azide derivatives 3a\u2013c in the presence of Et3N and CuI in acetonitrile to give target compounds 4a\u2013n.\nIn vitro \u03b1\u2011glucosidase inhibitory activity. All the synthesized analogues 4a\u2013n were evaluated for their in\u00a0vitro anti-\u03b1-glucosidase activity. Acarbose was used as positive control and the results were summarized in Table\u00a01. As can be seen in the Scheme\u00a01, for the synthesis of target compounds, 5 type of secondary amines were used. On the other hand, there are phenyl, 4-methylphenyl, and or 4-methoxyphenyl groups in the benzenesulfonamide moiety. Enzymatic inhibition results revealed that most of the title compounds exhibited a convincingly potential \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition, in which compound 4m bearing 4-phenylpiperazin and 4-methylphenyl ring was found as the most potent compound (IC50 = 52.2 \u00b1 0.1\u00a0\u03bcM), which is nearly 14.5-fold more active than acarbose (IC50 = 750.0 \u00b1 10.0\u00a0\u03bcM).\nThe comparison of IC50 values of piperidine derivatives 4a\u2013c with their corresponding morpholine derivatives 4d\u2013f against \u03b1-glucosidase revealed that phenyl derivatives (compounds 4a and 4d) in both group are inactive while 4-methylphenyl (compounds 4b and 4e) derivatives in both group showed high inhibitory activity (Fig.\u00a03). In contrast, 4-methoxyphenyl derivative 4c of piperidine series demonstrated a good anti-\u03b1-glucosidase activity while its corresponding morpholine analog was inactive.\nAs can be seen in Fig.\u00a04, phenyl derivative 4g with N,N-diphenylamine moiety demonstrated moderate inhibitory activity while its corresponding analog with 4-benzylpiperidine 4i showed high inhibitory activity against \u03b1-glucosidase. This compound was the second potent compound among the synthesized compounds. Both\nFigure\u00a02.

Synthesis of phthalimide-benzenesulfonamide derivatives 4a\u2013n (ChemDraw 18.2).\n5 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:10569 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-14896-2\n4-methylphenyl analogs with N,N-diphenylamine and 4-benzylpiperidine, compounds 4h and 4j, were moderate \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors. Moreover, 4-methoxyphenyl derivative 4k with 4-benzylpiperidine moiety was inactive.\nFinally, as can be seen in Fig.\u00a05, among the 4-phenylpiperazin derivatives 4l\u2013n, only the compound 4m containing 4-methyphenyl moiety was active. This compound was also the most potent compounds among the all synthesized compounds.\nEnzyme kinetic analysis. Kinetic study of the most potent compound 4m was performed by preparation of Lineweaver\u2013Burk plot of this compound. The analysis of this plot demonstrated that with an increase in concentration of compound 4m, Vmax remains constant but the Km increases. Therefore, compound 4m competes with the substrate for binding to \u03b1-glucosidase (Fig.\u00a06a). Moreover, Ki value of the latter compound was 52.7\u00a0\u03bcM that obtained by the plot of the Km versus different concentrations of compound 4m (Fig.\u00a06b).\nDocking study. According to Yamamoto et\u00a0 al. study, the pocket shape of the active site \u03b1-glucosidase located at the interface of domain A and B, which contain conserve residues around the substrate-binding site23. Based on Davies et\u00a0al. nomenclature, there are four subsides involved in substrate binding; \u2212 1, + 1, + 2, and + 3 subsides24. The location and residue specification of \u03b1-glucosidase subsides are showed in Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a. The \u2212 1 and + 1 subsides consist of Asp214, Glu276, Asp349, Asp68, Tyr71, His111, Phe177, Gln181, and Arg348 (colored in green). The + 2 subside which are defined by Phe157, His239, Asn241 and Ala278 (colored in purple), whereas the + 3 subside depicted by His279, Glu304, Thr307 and Phe311 (colored in red)25,26.\nThe reliability of the applied docking protocol was assessed by re-docking of the enzyme substrate (\u03b1-Dglucose) into the active site of the \u03b1-glucosidase. Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b shows the superimposed structures between the docked and the modeled \u03b1-D-glucose over \u03b1-glucosidase, which its RMSD is in acceptable value within the cutoff limit (0.32\u00a0\u00c5).\nFigure\u00a03.

Table\u00a02 shows docking score, glide score and IFD score of the top scoring pose of all the synthesized compounds. The obtained IFD scores are close to and correlated with the experimental results. Compounds 4m and 4i with the highest inhibitory activity represent the highest negative score of IFD \u2212 1297.89 and \u2212 1299.69\u00a0kcal/mol, respectively, while compounds 4a, 4d, 4f, 4k, 4l, and 4n with the lowest activities show lower negative score of IFD score (\u2212 1293.25, \u2212 1294.56, \u2212 1294.02, \u2212 1294.51, \u2212 1295.92, and \u2212 1294.98\u00a0kcal/mol, respectively).\nThe poses of the most active and the lowest active compounds were analyzed inside the binding site of \u03b1-glucosidase. Figure\u00a07a and b show the structure and interaction mode of acarbose in which it deeply inserted into the active site. The valienamine moiety of acarbose which is corresponds to the non-reducing terminal of this compound interacted with Asp68, Tyr71, His111, Asp214, Asp349, His348 at the \u2212 1 and + 1 subsides at the bottom of the active site. Furthermore, acarbose established hydrogen bonds with N\u2013H units of Asn241 and Arg312 at the + 2 and + 3 subsides with distances 1.81\u00a0\u00c5 and 1.76\u00a0\u00c5, respectively.\nFigure\u00a04. Comparison of \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities of analogs 4g\u2013k (ChemDraw 18.2).\nFigure\u00a05.

Furthermore, the phenylpiperazine group located between two loops at the hydrophobic entrance of the active site which are created by the residues at the tip of + 2 (Phe157) and + 3 (Phe311) subsides, respectively. In addition, phthalimide moiety positioned at the interface of the + 2 and + 3 subsides through hydrophobic interaction.\nAmong all compounds, compound 4i, as the second potent compound, possessed the best docking score, glide energy and IFD score of \u2212 7.84, \u2212 62.32\u00a0kcal/mol, and \u2212 1299.69, respectively. It depicts similar orientation and interaction to 4m in which the phenylpiperazine group located between two loops at the hydrophobic entrance of the active site and stabilized through \u03c0-cation and \u03c0-\u03c0 hydrophobic interactions with Lys155 from the + 2 subside and Phe311 from the + 3 subsides, respectively (Fig.\u00a07d). The phthalimide moiety tends toward the + 3 subside in which it formed \u03c0-\u03c0 hydrophobic interaction with Phe300 at the most bottom part. Also Fig.\u00a07d reveals that the benzensulfonamide moiety oriented toward the \u2212 1 subside while the phenyl group rotated toward the + 1 subside space.\nOn the other hand, compounds 4l and 4n with the lowest IFD score and inhibition activity showed different orientation with the potent compounds 4m and 4i. Benzensulfonamide moiety of both of compounds 4l and 4n totally shifted from the \u2212 1 subside toward the active site mouth (Fig.\u00a07e and f). The mentioned shifting observation may be as a result of the higher steric clash associated with the 4-methoxyphenyl moiety in compound\nFigure\u00a06.

In other word the para position of benzenesulfonamide moiety should provide the substitution with an optimum size in order to proper positioning toward the \u2212 1 subside. This finding is consistence with our\nFigure\u00a07. Acarbose structure (a) and docked representation of acarbose (b), the most active synthesized compounds 4m (c) and 4i (d) and the lowest active compounds 4l (e) and 4n (f) over the \u03b1-glucosidase active site. Domain A and B are colored in yellow and blue, respectively. The docked compounds colored in cyan. The \u03b1-glucosidase subsides residues include region \u2212 1 and + 1 are in green color also the + 2 and + 3 subsides are in purple and orange, respectively (Maestro Molecular Modeling platform (version 12.5)).\n9 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:10569 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-14896-2\nexperimental inhibition assay in which compounds which has more steric 4-methoxy group (4c, 4f, 4k, and 4n) or lack any proper hydrophobic group at the mentioned position (4a, 4d, and 4l) showed lower inhibition activity than acarbose.\nBased on the observed results, it can be concluded that the proper positioning of benzensulfonamide moiety into the \u2212 1 and + 1 subsides is important to reserve high enzyme inhibition activity as observed in compounds 4m and 4i.\nBy the way, in the case of compounds 4i, 4j, and 4k with more bulky amine group like 4-benzylpiperidine, it can be observed that the lower size of the substitution over para benzenesulfonamide moiety is more favorable for high inhibitory action against \u03b1-glucosidase. The docking score, glide energy and IFD score of the mentioned compounds reveal that the energy related to the compound 4i is more negative (\u2212 7.84, \u2212 62.32, and \u2212 1299.69\u00a0kcal/mol) than 4j (\u2212 6.02, \u2212 55.10, and \u2212 1296.01), which is in accordance with the experimental data. So, the absence of only \u2018\u2013CH3 group\u2019 intervene to achieving high inhibitory affinity for compound 4i with more bulkier amine group, but presence of such group leading less inhibitory action against \u03b1-glucosidase for compound 4j.\nMolecular dynamics investigation. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation performed in order to understand the effect of the compound over the enzyme active site. For this purpose, the structural perturbations incurred by the most potent compound (compound 4m) have been investigated over the active site environment.\nRoot mean square deviation (RMSD) of the \u03b1-glucosidase was analyzed over 60\u00a0ns MD simulation in order to evaluate the stability of the protein\u2013ligand complex. The RMSD value of the unbounded target enzyme depicts higher RMSD value than the other two bounded-state enzyme complexes (Fig.\u00a08). The RMSD value significantly increased during the first 7.5\u00a0ns up to 2.5\u00a0\u00c5 and steadily fluctuated to the next 30\u00a0ns and become more stable for the last 15\u00a0ns of the simulation time with the value of 2.6\u00a0\u00c5 (Fig.\u00a08, red line). Moreover, based on the RMSD values of \u03b1-glucosidase-acarbose and \u03b1-glucosidase-compound 4m complexes, the bounded-state enzymes were stable during the simulation time with the lower RMSD values (1.8\u00a0\u00c5 and 1.5\u00a0\u00c5, respectively). The latter result indicated that the employed simulation time has been enough to obtain an equilibrium structure over the simulation time (Fig.\u00a08, green and blue line).\nThe RMSF plot which depicts the flexibility of protein structure showed that compound 4m decreased the RMSF value of \u03b1-glycosidase residues in four regions as a result of non-bonding interactions; the B domain loop, the B domain side, the active site lid, and almost half of the A domain side (Fig.\u00a09a). Furthermore, Fig.\u00a09a showed that although the flexibility of the active site lid was the highest in enzyme acarbose bound-state, the mentioned segment flexibility revealed the lowest in \u03b1-glycosidase complexed with compound 4m. Also, the organization of the \u03b1-glycosidase three main domains; A, B, and C along with the close-up representation of the active site mouth with the corresponding residues of A and B domains at the both sides of active site entrances represent in Fig.\u00a09b and c, respectively. Based on the RMSF plot, acarbose and compound 4m have almost the same interaction pattern through the whole \u03b1-glycosidase structure. The only dissimilarity comes from active site lid flexibility in which we can proposed that compound 4m has superior effect in rigidity of active site lid rather than acarbose.\nIn addition, different residues and types of interactions during the whole MD simulation time was showed in Fig.\u00a010. Based on the timeline result, compound 4m interacted with Phe157, His239, His241, and Ala278 which belong to the + 2 subside and Arg212, Trp242, His279, and Glu304 for approximate the first 15\u00a0ns of the MD simulation time. Otherwise, after about 15\u00a0ns until to the end of simulation some of interactions of the mentioned\nFigure\u00a08.

Based on the cluster analysis of compound 4m, the percent of population in cluster 1 was 86.37% in the first section and 95% in the second section in which the representative frame from cluster 1 of the section\u00a01 (Fig.\u00a010b) and the section\u00a02 (Fig.\u00a010c) were selected for investigating the 3D complex interaction.\nAs it is obvious in Fig.\u00a010b, at the first stage of MD simulation, compound 4m coordinated in a way that the 4-methylbenzensulfonamide moiety oriented toward the \u2212 1 subside. In addition, the 4-methylbenzensulfonamide, phenylpiperazine, and phthalimide aromatic rings provided \u03c0-\u03c0 hydrophobic interactions with Phe157, His239 Asn241, and Trp242, respectively. Also, the sulfonamide moiety stabilized through H-bond interaction with Asn241 (2.3\u00a0\u00c5). Otherwise, after about 15\u00a0ns the 4-methylbenzensulfonamide gradually rotated along its sigma C-N bond and flipped toward the + 3 subunit which was accompany with deep penetrating of the mentioned moiety toward the catalytic part of the active site, consequently electrophilic imine carbon (C = N) faced and exposed toward the three catalytic acidic residues; Asp214, Asp349, and Glu279. The new conformation and orientation of compound 4m increased an average number of ligand-enzyme contacts from 4 to 8 interactions (Fig.\u00a010d, up). In addition, Fig.\u00a010a and c depict the sulfonamide moiety tightly stabilized with Arg439 through the strong H-bond interaction in 1.2\u00a0\u00c5 distance during a significant amount of the simulation time.\nFigure\u00a09.

Druglikeness, ADME, and Toxicity profile of the most active compound 4m and positive control acarbose were assigned using PreADMET as an online software and the obtained predictions were listed in Table\u00a03. 27 As can be seen in Table\u00a03, compound 4m followed of Lipinski \u2018Rule of five\u2019 while acarbose did not follow of this rule. ADME prediction also showed that compound 4m and acarbose have poor permeability to Caco-2 cell and their permeability to blood brain barrier (BBB) is in the normal range; compound 4m has high human intestinal absorption (HIA) while acarbose did not have HIA. In term of toxicity, PreADMET predicted that compound 4m and acarbose are both mutagenic; compound 4m did not have carcinogenicity on mouse and rat while acarbose may have carcinogenicity on mouse. Furthermore, cardiotoxicity of acarbose is ambiguous while compound 4m exhibited low risk in term of cardiotoxicity (hERG inhibition).\nFigure\u00a010.

Benzenesulfonyl azide derivatives 3a\u2013c were prepared according to the procedure described in the literature29.\nGeneral procedure for the synthesis of dioxoisoindolin arylsulfonamides 4a\u2013n.

In vitro \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition assay of target compounds 4a\u2013n, kinetic analysis of the most potent compound, and in\u00a0vitro \u03b1-amylase inhibitory activity of the selected compounds were performed exactly according to our previous work29.\nMolecular modeling procedure. Maestro Molecular Modeling platform (version12.5) by Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC was performed to uncover out the interactions mode of the best active structures over \u03b1-glycosidase enzyme30. The protein 3D structure was implemented according to our previous study as a result of homology modeled based on high structural identity and sequence similarity with \u03b1-glucosidase (\u03b1-1,4-glucosidase) from S. cerevisiae (PDB code 3A4A)31.\nThe 2D representation of the synthesized compounds were drawn in Marvin 15.10.12.0 program (http:// www. chema xon. com) and converted into pdb file32. The Protein Preparation Wizard and the LigPrep module were used to prepare protein and ligand structure properly33,34. The missing side chains of the proteins were filled using the Prime tool and missing residues were updated.\nThe accurate side-chain and backbone flexibility during ligand binding at the active site of \u03b1-glycosidase enzyme were predicted by IFD method using Glide software (Schr\u00f6dinger LLC 2018, USA)35. As the kinetic study revealed competitive type inhibition mechanism against enzyme, the \u03b1-glucosidase active site was used to generate the grid for IFD calculation. The maximum 20 poses with receptor and ligand van der waals radii of 0.7 and 0.5, respectively considered. Residues within 5\u00a0\u00c5 of the \u03b1-D-glucose at the active site were refined followed by side-chain optimization. Structures whose Prime energy is more than 30\u00a0kcal/mol are eliminated based on extra precious Glide docking.\nMolecular dynamics simulation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of this study was performed by using the Desmond v5.3 module implemented in Maestro interface (from Schr\u00f6dinger 2018\u20104 suite)36,37. The appropriate pose for MD simulation procedure of the compounds was achieved by IFD method.\n15\nVol.:(0123456789)\nScientific Reports | (2022) 12:10569 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-14896-2\nIn order to build the system for MD simulation, the protein\u2013ligand complexes were solvated with SPC explicit water molecules and placed in the center of an orthorhombic box of appropriate size in the Periodic Boundary Condition. Sufficient counter\u2010ions and a 0.15\u00a0M solution of NaCl were also utilized to neutralize the system and to simulate the real cellular ionic concentrations, respectively. The MD protocol involved minimization, pre-production, and finally production MD simulation steps. In the minimization procedure, the entire system was allowed to relax for 2500 steps by the steepest descent approach. Then the temperature of the system was raised from 0 to 300\u00a0K with a small force constant on the enzyme in order to restrict any drastic changes. MD simulations were performed via NPT (constant number of atoms, constant pressure i.e. 1.01325\u00a0bar and constant temperature i.e. 300\u00a0K) ensemble. The Nose\u2010Hoover chain method was used as the default thermostat with 1.0\u00a0ps interval and Martyna\u2010Tobias\u2010Klein as the default barostat with 2.0\u00a0ps interval by applying isotropic coupling style. Long\u2010range electrostatic forces were calculated based on Particle\u2010mesh\u2010based Ewald approach with the he cut\u2010off radius for columbic forces set to 9.0\u00a0\u00c5. Finally, the system subjected to produce MD simulations for 60\u00a0ns for protein\u2013ligand complex. During the simulation every 1000\u00a0ps of the actual frame was stored. The dynamics behavior and structural changes of the systems were analyzed by the calculation of the root mean square deviation (RMSD) and RMSF. Subsequently, the energy-minimized structure calculated from the equilibrated trajectory system was evaluated for investigation of each ligand\u2013protein complex interaction.\nPrime MM\u2011GBSA. The ligand binding energies (\u0394GBind) were calculated for compound 4m and acarbose using Molecular mechanics/generalized born surface area (MM GBSA) modules (Schr\u00f6dinger LLC 2018) based on the following equation;\nwhere \u0394G Bind is the calculated relative free energy which includes both ligand and receptor strain energy. EComplex is the MM-GBSA energy of the minimized complex, and E Ligand is the MM-GBSA energy of the ligand after removing it from the complex and allowing it to relax. E Receptor is the MM-GBSA energy of relaxed protein after separating it from the ligand. The MM-GBSA calculation was performed based on the clustering method for energy calculation38,39.\nIn silico druglikeness/ADME/T prediction. In silico druglikeness/ADME/T studies of most avtive compound and positive control acarbose were carried out using by preADMET online server (http:// pread met. bmdrc. org/)28.\nReceived: 3 October 2021; Accepted: 4 May 2022"
