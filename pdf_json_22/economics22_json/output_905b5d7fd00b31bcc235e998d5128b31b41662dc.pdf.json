            "text": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, imposing substantial social, economic, and health burdens on individuals and society annually (Daroudi et al., 2015; Sechopoulos and Mann, 2020). Considering the demographic changes in the populations, it is predicted that the global burden of cancers will increase from 13.3 million cases in 2010 to 21.4 million cases in 2030 (Heer et al., 2020; Dsouza et al., 2021). Breast cancer in women is a significant health problem worldwide. It is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in developed and developing countries and the leading cause of death among women globally (Ferlay et al., 2010). Moreover, breast cancer was identified as the leading cause of global inflection with cancer in 2020, with an estimated 2.3\nObjective: This study sought to investigate Iranian women\u2019s preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) based on the level of breast self-examination and mammography screening practice and knowledge, including risk factors, signs and symptoms, and early detection methods via mammography screening. Methods: This is a descriptive, cross-sectional, population-based study conducted from October to March 2020 on over 35-year-old women living in Mashhad, selected through the convenient sampling method applied in health centers of Mashhad city. To measure the willingness to pay, the study participants were asked for their preferred choices concerning out-of-pocket payment for screening. Results: More than one-half (58.6%) of the study\u2019s sample size had an intermediate level of knowledge regarding breast cancer\u2019s risk factors, and only 12.7% of them had an unsatisfactory level of knowledge. However, most of the participants had a poor level of practice towards breast self-examination and mammography screening. The results of measuring the willingness to pay (WTP) indicated that 11.5% of the participants were not willing to pay at all for mammography breast cancer screening, while 53.3% of the participants were willing to pay 2.27 to 3.41 $U.S, and 35.2% of the participants were willing to pay more than 3.41 $U.S for mammography breast cancer screening. Conclusion: Any attempt to promote breast cancer screening among Iranian women should primarily focus on increasing such indices as awareness, education, health status, and household income. It should be noted that the majority of the participants possessed an average level of knowledge. Moreover, women lack appropriate information about breast cancer and its\u2019 early detection measures. However, it was found that self-employed women were more likely to practice breast self-examination than the women employed in governmental organizations, which could be attributed to the fact that self-employed women could dedicate more time to checking their breasts and practicing breast self-examination.\nKeywords: Breast cancer screening- willingness-to-pay- knowledge- mammography\nmillion newly diagnosed cases, representing 11.7% of all cancer cases worldwide (Sung et al., 2021). It is the fifth cause of cancer mortality worldwide, with 685,000 deaths each year (Zeng et al., 2021). In fact, breast cancer accounts for 1 in 4 cancer cases and 1 in 6 cancer-induced deaths among women, ranking first in the cases diagnosed with cancer (Sung et al., 2021).\nEarly diagnosis of cancer significantly increases the chances of successful treatment. There are two primary components of early diagnosis of cancer: health promotion, including education and screening. Increasing the social awareness regarding the cancer and performing screening for common cancers provide for the most cost-effective approach to prevent and control different types of cancer, bearing high public health potential(Abu, 2020; Mulmi et al., 2021).\n1Department of Economics, Payame Noor University (PNU), Tehran, Iran. 2Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Department of Health and Management, School of Health, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. 3Department of Agricultural Economics, Payame Noor University (PNU), Tehran, Iran. *For Correspondence: ar7315834@gmail.com"

Adopting more effective strategies in empowering physicians and preparing them to prescribe appropriate screening tests are key factors that ultimately contribute to early diagnosis and optimal breast cancer prognosis (Wu et al., 2020).\nThree common approaches to breast cancer screening include breast self-examination, physical examination by a physician, and mammography (Miller and Baines, 2011; Shieh et al., 2017). Monthly breast self-examination is currently under discussion as a screening method (Bokaie and Lotfi, 2013). However, the American Cancer Society (ACS) does not recommend a monthly breast self-examination, emphasizing that the detection of symptoms often occurs unorganized while women are taking a shower or getting dressed (Rahman et al., 2019). According to the ACS, self-awareness is more effective than structured self-examination. Accordingly, over-20 women should be aware of breast self-examination\u2019s possible benefits and limitations (Elasbali et al., 2019).\nEarly diagnosis of breast cancer increases the chances of successful treatment and survival and reduces mortality and disease incidence trends (Francies et al., 2020). Diagnostic strategies include breast self-examination, clinical examination by a physician, and mammography (Al-Mousa et al., 2020), among which the latter is considered as an effective screening method for diagnosing breast cancer at early stages (Grady et al., 2017). In fact, breast cancer could be diagnosed through mammography 1-3 years before its symptoms appear in the patient (Venkataramanan et al., 2020). Therefore, timely mammography screening in 40- year-old or older women could help prevent breast cancer mortality by 15- 30% (Irani et al., 2021).\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has also attracted global attention to the significant increase in breast cancer cases in recent years and warned of the growing trend of the cancer in the coming years, suggesting early diagnosis as an essential strategy in controlling breast cancer (Akinyemiju, 2012). In fact, this strategy which could increase the chances of breast cancer diagnosis in the early stages of the disease tends to be more curative (Phi et al., 2018).\nThe breast cancer screening program seeks to diagnose the breast masses early when they are small, and the patient still displays no specific clinical symptom. Therefore, early diagnosis of benign and malignant masses may alleviate the concerns of the patient\u2019s family. People who get screened are those with no signs and symptoms of breast cancer (Gardezi et al., 2019; Ginsburg et al., 2020).\nAccording to the studies conducted from 2004 to 2015, the most common types of cancer in Iran include gastrointestinal cancer in males and breast cancer in females, and the age of women diagnosed with the cancer are approximately 41-45 years old, being ten years younger than that of the development countries (Askarzade et al., 2019).\nWillingness to pay-contingent valuation method (WTP-CVM) has emerged as one of the most reliable tools for pricing the early diagnosis of breast cancer. In fact, the contingent valuation method (CVM) is used to estimate\nthe willingness to pay (WTP), which itself is measured in cost-benefit analysis in economics (Ghaderi et al., 2012).\nAs few studies have so far been conducted to examine the level of knowledge, attitude, practice towards breast self-examination and mammography screening, and willingness to pay for early diagnosis of breast cancer in over 35-year Iranian women, this study sought to investigate women\u2019s preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) in terms of the level of practice towards breast self-examination and mammography screening, and breast cancer knowledge, including risk factors, signs and symptoms, and early detection methods, performing mammography screening on over 35-year-old women living in Mashhad, the largest city in eastern Iran."

To this end, the study\u2019s participants were selected from among those who visited Mashhad\u2019s health centers using convenient sampling.\nThe study\u2019s target population comprised of Iranian females who were 35 years old or over living in Mashhad (Northeast of Iran). Data were collected from five culturally and economically different regions of Mashhad, which were selected based on expert opinions and represented all parts of the city.

Totally, 384 people were selected as the sample size of the study, using the Cochran formula.\nIn similar studies, 50% of the participants had performed regular mammogram. Based on this proportion, the sample size was calculated using the following equation: Sample size (n) = (Z1-\u03b1/2)\n2 \u00d7 pq/d2, where, Z =1.96 for 95% confidence interval (Prevalence (p) = 0.5; Compliment of P (q) =1-0.5= 0.5, d=0.05).\nThus, based on a 95% confidence level and 10% p allowable error (d), the sample size included 384 cases.\nThe study\u2019s participants were selected via nonprobability purposive sampling. The data were collected by the corresponding author and the first author via entirely voluntarily face-to-face interviews with women who visited the health centers. Moreover, a researcher-developed questionnaire was administered, comprising five parts, whose items concerning the women\u2019s willingness to pay, knowledge of breast cancer, practice towards breast self-examination and mammography screening, and preferences were derived from previous studies (Sabermahani et al., 2017; Mathioudakis et al., 2019; Rahman et al., 2019; Al-Mousa et al., 2020). The first part of the questionnaire was to elicit demographic background regarding the respondents\u2019\nDOI:10.31557/APJCP.2022.23.4.1207 Women\u2019s Preferences For Mammographic Screening Tests\n(288 women (75% of the participants)). Also, 87% of the participants were covered by health insurance, and 35% of them had supplementary health insurance. According to the study\u2019s results, 30% of the participants had a family history of breast cancer, and only 9.4% of them were previously diagnosed with breast diseases.\nThe participants\u2019 knowledge of Breast Cancer\u2019s risk factors and signs and symptoms\nTable 1 shows the respondents\u2019 knowledge concerning each item of breast cancer\u2019s risk factors. According to the\nage, education, working status, marital status, housing status, domicile, income level, health insurance coverage, voluntary supplementary insurance, family size, health index, knowledge index, practice index, and personal or family history in terms of breast cancer.\nThe second part examined the participants\u2019 knowledge of breast cancer\u2019s risk factors (13 items), the third explored the respondents\u2019 knowledge concerning breast cancer\u2019s signs and symptoms (7 items), and the fourth part investigated the participants\u2019 practice of breast cancer\u2019s early diagnosis (3 items). Finally, the last part attempted to examine the participants\u2019 willingness to pay for performing mammographic breast cancer screening tests using the contingent valuation method. The required time to fill out the questionnaire ranged from 5 to 20 minutes.\nAs mentioned before, the contingent valuation method (CVM) was used in this study to estimate the willingness to pay (WTP), which is theoretically based on a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) in an economic evaluation. The Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) is usually employed to value goods that are not available in the market (Phelps et al., 2018). To measure the willingness to pay, the participants\u2019 preferred choices concerning the out-of-pocket payment for screening were asked. Contingent Valuation estimates the value that a person assigns to a product. Instead of inferring individuals\u2019 willingness to pay (WTP) for receiving specified goods or services based on observing their behaviors in regular marketplaces, the approach asks people to report their willingness to pay in that regard directly."

Also, more than half (58.6%) of the participants had an intermediate (average) level of knowledge about breast cancer\u2019s risk factors, and 12.7% of them had an unsatisfactory level of knowledge in this regard.\nTable 3 shows the participants\u2019 level of practice\ntowards the breast cancer screening, showing their attempts to perform mammography.

Only 15% of them had a satisfactory level of such a practice.\nThe results of examining the willingness to pay (WTP) variable indicated that while 11.5% of the participants were not willing to pay any amount for mammography breast cancer screening, 53.3% of them were willing to pay from 2.27 to 3.41 $U.S, and 35.2% of them were willing to pay more than 3.41 $U.S for that type of screening, suggesting that most of the participants were willing to pay higher prices for mammograms. The mean value of the participants\u2019 willingness to pay was 3.5 $ U.S (see Table 4).\nTable 5 shows the estimated parameters derived from the ordinal logistic regression model, showing the estimated coefficients of all variables. The positive value of the constant term in the model indicated that the participants preferred screening over no screening.\nAccording to the results of ordinal logistic regression (Table 5), the patient\u2019s education, the education status of the patient\u2019s husband, domicile, income level, health insurance status, voluntary supplementary insurance, family history of the breast cancer, health index, knowledge index, and practice index had positive effects on the participants WTP for performing mammography screening so that their possible breath cancer is diagnosed at early stages of the disease.\nIn terms of education, it could be argued that the participants with higher education were more aware of the necessity of performing the screening for their own health.\nThe significant positive correlation between the family income and the women\u2019s WTP for breast cancer screening indicated that women with higher income and more financial strength were more willing to pay for the screening (Coefficient:0.7; The reference group comprised of women with the lowest income level ). Moreover, as the supplementary insurance compensates for the costs up to a certain amount, those covered by such insurance were more willing to pay for the mammography screening (Coefficient: 0.82; The women in the reference group lacked supplementary insurance coverage). Women with a history of breast cancer in their families were also more willing to pay for mammography breast cancer screening. In fact, as confirmed by the statistics, worries about being diagnosed with cancer make people pay any amount for the screening (Coefficient: 0.63; The reference group included women with no history of breast cancer).\nFurthermore, those who believed in and observed health-related standards were more willing to pay for breast cancer screening (Coefficient: 0.7; The reference group comprised of women who were indifferent to their health), and those with greater knowledge regarding breast cancer and its screening were willing to pay higher prices for mammography screening (Coefficient: 0.1; Reference group comprised of women with lower level of knowledge regarding breast cancer). In addition, women\u2019s practice towards breast self-examination and mammography screening had a significant positive effect on the WTP variable, suggesting that women who practiced breast self-examination at regular intervals or had previously practiced mammography were more\nwilling to pay for such a screening (Coefficient: 0.5; The reference group included women who had not practiced breast self-examination at regular intervals or had not previously practiced mammography). On the other hand, age, occupation, and family size had negative effects on WTP for screening with the aim of early detection of breast cancer.\nIn terms of occupation, housewives and women with an occupation that required higher education were more willing to pay for the screening (Coefficient: 0.26; The reference group comprised of self-employed). In addition, age and family size had significant negative effects on the participants\u2019 willingness to pay, with the older women and those with larger families being less willing to pay for mammography screening. In other words, younger women paid more attention to their health and were more willing to pay for the screening than the older ones (Coefficient: -0.04; The Reference groups comprised of smaller families and younger women)."

The majority of the participants possessed an average level of knowledge regarding breast cancer. Self-employed women were more likely to practice breast self-examination than the women working in governmental organizations, which could be attributed to the fact that self-employed women had more free time to check their breasts and practice breast self-examination. Previous studies have revealed that most women have an intermediate level of knowledge concerning breast cancer\u2019s risk factors and that only a low percentage of people have a good to an excellent level of knowledge in this regard (Al-Mousa et al., 2020; Pal et al., 2021).\nThe variables of age and occupation had significant negative effects on WTP, with the WTP decreasing as the age increased, indicating that young women had a better understanding of the need for mammography screening. Also, Kristina et al., (2020), Zhao et al., (2018), and Sana et al.,(2020) reported a significant correlation between age and willingness to pay. However, in a study carried out by Wong and Saengow (2018), no significant correlation was found between the two. This difference between the findings of the current study and those of Wong and Saengow (2918) concerning the correlation between age and WTP could be attributed to the difference in the subject of the study.

Moreover, according to the study\u2019s results, the willingness to pay will significantly increase with the increase in knowledge regarding breast cancer.\nA study conducted by Al-Mousa et al., (2020) to investigate the relationship between the level of knowledge on risk factors, signs and symptoms, breast cancer early detection methods, breast cancer curability, and socio-demographic characteristics found that those who live in urban areas have significantly higher knowledge concerning the breast cancer\u2019s signs and symptoms compared to those who live in rural areas. These findings are consistent with the ones found by Kotepui et al., (2014), showing that the female medical and health personnel acquired adequate knowledge on breast cancer due to the daily interactions made between academic and non-academic staff. Furthermore, the knowledge of this study\u2019s participants regarding the breast cancer\u2019s signs and symptoms, including painless breast lump, swollen axillary glands, bloody discharge from the nipple, and nipple change, was generally good (>70.0%) (Al-Mousa et al., 2020). It should be noted that all of the study\u2019s participants were living in urban areas.\nAccording to the results obtained from the logistic regression model, there was a significant positive correlation between income and health insurance status and willingness to pay. Also, people with higher financial ability tended to pay higher prices for breast cancer screening, with the demand for the screening increasing with an increase in income level (Wright et al., 2018; Lew et al., 2020). In addition, indices such as health, knowledge, and practice of mammography screening directly affected the willingness to pay, with younger people typically paying much more money for the screening than do the older people.\nThe mean value of the willingness to pay was 3.5 $U.S. Moreover, there was a significant positive relationship between education and the willingness to pay, with the WTP for mammography breast cancer screening increasing with an increase in education level (Venkataramanan et al., 2020), suggesting that the higher the women\u2019s education was, the more likely they would be to practice breast cancer screening test. These results are in agreement with findings of the previous studies that found a significant correlation between the level of knowledge on breast cancer screening level of education, according to which women with higher education had a higher level of knowledge on breast cancer as they tended to engage more in health improvement activities. Similarly, a study conducted on people living in Kerman province (2017) reported that the factors were involved in WTP for breast cancer screening.\nIn conclusion, it could be argued that any promotion of breast cancer screening among Iranian women should primarily focus on increasing such indices as awareness,\neducation, health status, and household income level. It should be noted that willingness to pay is a hypothetical measure of a person\u2019s stated preference. Indeed, some consider it as a less reliable index of people\u2019s actual behavior. Therefore, promoting the practice of breast cancer screening tests requires careful planning and more attention to removing the barriers. The majority of the study\u2019s participants possessed an average level of knowledge. However, some participants lacked appropriate information concerning breast cancer and its\u2019 early detection methods. Self-employed women were more likely to practice breast self-examination compared to those employed by governmental organizations, as they had had more free time to check their breasts and practice breast self-examination."
