    "abstractText": "Background Ubc13 is the only known ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (Ubc/E2) dedicated to promoting Lys (K)63linked polyubiquitination, and this process requires a Ubc/E2 variant (UEV). Unlike conventional K48-linked polyubiquitination that targets proteins for degradation, K63-linked polyubiquitination, which is involved in several cellular processes, does not target proteins for degradation but alter their activities. Results In this study we report the identification and functional characterization of 12 Brassica napus UBC13 genes. All the cloned UBC13 gene products were able to physically interact with AtUev1D, an Arabidopsis UEV, to form stable complexes that are capable of catalyzing K63-linked polyubiquitination in vitro. Furthermore, BnUBC13 genes functionally complemented the yeast ubc13 null mutant defects in spontaneous mutagenesis and DNA-damage responses, suggesting that BnUBC13s can replace yeast UBC13 in mediating K63-linked polyubiquitination and errorfree DNA-damage tolerance. Conclusion Collectively, this study provides convincing data to support notions that B. napus Ubc13s promote K63-linked polyubiquitination and are probably required for abiotic stress response. Since plant Ubc13-UEV are also implicated in other developmental and stress responses, this systematic study sets a milestone in exploring roles of K63-linked polyubiquitination in this agriculturally important crop.",

All the cloned UBC13 gene products were able to physically interact with AtUev1D, an Arabidopsis UEV, to form stable complexes that are capable of catalyzing K63-linked polyubiquitination in vitro. Furthermore, BnUBC13 genes functionally complemented the yeast ubc13 null mutant defects in spontaneous mutagenesis and DNA-damage responses, suggesting that BnUBC13s can replace yeast UBC13 in mediating K63-linked polyubiquitination and errorfree DNA-damage tolerance.\nConclusion Collectively, this study provides convincing data to support notions that B. napus Ubc13s promote K63-linked polyubiquitination and are probably required for abiotic stress response. Since plant Ubc13-UEV are also implicated in other developmental and stress responses, this systematic study sets a milestone in exploring roles of K63-linked polyubiquitination in this agriculturally important crop.\nKeywords Brassica napus, DNA-damage tolerance, K63-linked polyubiquitination, Protein-protein interaction, Abiotic response"

            "text": "Ubiquitin (Ub) is an abundant and one of most highly conserved proteins in eukaryotes, from unicellular yeast to human. Ub is able to conjugate with other proteins by forming an isopeptide bond using its C-terminal glycine (G76) residue and eventually produces a monoubiquitinated substrate [1]. Ub has two key features. One is that its G76 can form an isopeptide bond with a substrate lysine (K) residue. Another is that seven lysine residues in Ub, namely K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48 and K63 can be potentially used to form distinct types of poly-Ub chains; at least five of which have been observed in\u00a0vitro or in\u00a0vivo [2]. \u2020Ivanthi Kumasaruge and Rui Wen contributed equally to this work. *Correspondence: Wei Xiao wei.xiao@usask.ca 1 Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5E5, Canada 2 Saskatoon Research and Development Centre, Agriculture and AgriFood Canada, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0X2, Canada 3 Department of Plant Sciences, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada\nUbiquitination, a process of Ub attachment to targeted proteins, regulates diverse cellular activities such as proteasomal and lysosomal degradation, subcellular localization [3], DNA damage response [4, 5], ribosomal biogenesis [6], cell cycle progression [7], apoptosis [8], mitochondrial inheritance [9] and transcriptional regulation [10]. Ub conjugated to the target protein can alter the protein stability, localization or activity [11]. The ubiquitination requires three basic enzymatic activities to work in concert to transfer Ub to client substrates and form poly-Ub chains. Firstly, high energy thioester bond is formed with the C terminus of Ub by a Ub activating enzyme (Uba or E1). The Ub molecule is then transferred to the active-site Cys of a Ub-conjugating enzyme (Ubc or E2). The subsequent transfer of Ub to the \u03b5-amino group of a Lys side chain in the substrate is catalyzed by the Ub-charged E2 after binding to a Ub ligase (E3). It is well established that distinct structural and functional information is conveyed by poly-Ub chains bearing different linkages, in which K48-linked Ub chains mainly target protein for degradation by the 26\u00a0S proteosome. In contrast, K63linked chains confer non-proteolytic functions involved in well-characterized pathways including DNA damage response (DDR) [12, 13], NF-\u03baB activation [14, 15], mitochondrial inheritance [9], plasma membrane protein endocytosis [16], ribosome function [17] and cell-cycle checkpoints [18], in which target proteins conjugated with K63-linked poly-Ub chains affect protein-protein interaction and/or protein localization [1]. Thus far, Ubc13 is the only known E2 specialized in catalyzing K63-linked polyubiquitination, and this activity absolutely requires a Ubc/E2 variant (UEV) as a cofactor [12, 19]. It is well established that K48- and K63-linked poly-Ub chains represent two distinct conformations, in which the 26\u00a0S proteosome can only recognize the K48-linked zig-zag conformation, whereas proteins containing specialized tandem Ub-binding domains can recognize K63-linked stretched Ub chains [1, 20].\nThe model plant Arabidopsis thaliana contains two highly conserved UBC13 genes capable of functionally complementing the yeast ubc13 null mutant in terms of spontaneous mutagenesis and sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents [21]. Both AtUbc13s can interact with yeast and human UEVs [21] as well as Arabidopsis UEVs [22]. Subsequent studies reveal that AtUBC13s function in apical dominance [23], DDR [22], iron metabolism [24], auxin signaling [25], low temperature stress response [26] and plant immunity [26, 27]. In addition, systematic studies in Arabidopsis revealed additional target proteins modified by\nK63-linked polyubiquitination [28, 29], indicating that plant Ubc13s play multiple roles in plant development and stress responses.\nArabidopsis belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes large number of economic crops like rapeseed (Brassica napus) and its value-added breeding derivative canola [30]. Given the involvement of Ubc13 and K63-linked polyubiquitination in agriculturally related traits, we wish to investigate B. napus UBC13 genes. Here we report molecular cloning and functional characterization of UBC13 genes from B. napus, following strategies as outlined in Supplementary Fig. S1. All analyzed BnUbc13s can interact with AtUev1D and catalyze K63-linked poly-Ub chain assembly. Since UBC13 genes have been shown to play critical roles in plant development and responses to both abiotic and biotic stresses including agriculturally important features, this study sets a corner stone in improving the oilseed crop through genetic manipulations."

            "text": "Identification and\u00a0bioinformatics analyses of\u00a0Brassica napus UBC13 genes To identify B. napus UBC13 genes, the Arabidopsis Ubc13 protein sequence was used to Blast the B. napus protein database (https:// plants. ensem bl. org/ Brass ica_ napus/ Tools/ Blast). Eight predicted highly similar proteins (E-values at or below 10\u2212 56), namely BnaA06g11360D (GenBank accession OP380669), BnaC08g38130D (OP380670), BnaAnng13030D (OP380671), BnaC08g17090D (OP380672), BnaA07g34450D (OP380673), BnaA08g23450D (OP380674), BnaC05g12900D (OP380675) and BnaC06g39290D (OP380676), were found and named as BnUbc13A-H, respectively. In addition, four incomplete proteins in the database, BnaC02g25260D (OP380677), BnaA07g38410D (OP380679), BnaC06g20310D (OP380678) and BnaA02g19070D (OP380680), have about 99% sequence identity with AtUbc13. After cDNA amplification and sequencing, these four encoded proteins were also found to be highly homologous to AtUbc13 and subsequently named BnUbc13I-L. Features of the 12 identified BnUBC13 genes and gene products, including number of exons, gene location, protein domain and length, molecular weight (MW), isoelectric point (pI) and grand average of hydropathicity index (GRAVY), are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. All 12 BnUbc13 proteins contain 153 amino acids and their alignment with AtUbc13s is shown in Fig.\u00a01A. AtUbc13A and AtUbc13B differ by only two conserved amino acids [21]. Within BnUbc13s, BnUbc13A, B, I, J and L are identical to AtUbc13B; BnUbc13C and D are identical to each other but differ from AtUbc13B by one amino acid; BnUbc13E and K are identical to each other but differ from AtUbc13B by two amino acids; BnUbc13G, F and H differs\nfrom AtUbc13B by 1, 2 and 3 amino acids, respectively. These amino acid substitutions do not affect known functional residues, including M66 (blue asterisk) involved in physical interaction with E3s [31], E57, F59 and R72 [32] required for the interaction with UEV, and the active site C89 to conjugate Ub [12]. All BnUbc13s appear to be closer to AtUbc13B in sequence than to AtUbc13A, as the two amino acid variations in AtUbc13A were not found in any BnUbc13s (Fig.\u00a01A).\nThe phylogenetic analysis of BnUbc13s to AtUbc13s was performed. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 1B, all 12 BnUbc13s can be grouped into two clades separately derived from AtUbc13A and AtUbc13B, and the bootstraps in the clade of AtUbc13B are higher than that of AtUbc13A. To further assess the conservation of BnUBC13 genes in Brassicaceae, we performed synteny analysis among four related species: A. thaliana, B. napus, B. rapa and B. oleracea. As anticipated, the B. napus genome was split into two subgenomes A and C, corresponding to B. rapa and B. oleracea genomes, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2).\nDue to amino acid sequence redundancy, eight BnUBC13 genes (A to H) representing all BnUbc13 variants were used for the subsequent studies.\nFunctional complementation of\u00a0yeast ubc13 null mutants by\u00a0BnUBC13s Budding yeast UBC13 functions in the error-free DNAdamage tolerance (DDT) pathway [33\u201335]. To ask whether BnUBC13s have same functions as yeast UBC13, pGBT-BnUBC13 plasmids were transformed into the yeast ubc13\u2206 mutant and cell survival in the presence of various DNA-damaging agents were examined by a serial dilution assay. As previously reported [34], the yeast ubc13 mutant displayed an increased sensitivity to a variety of DNA-damaging agents including methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, while expression of BnUBC13s could functionally complement the yeast ubc13 DDT defect (Fig.\u00a02A). Similarly, in a gradient plate assay, deletion of UBC13 resulted in an increased sensitivity to MMS, while pGBT-BnUBC13s, but not the pGBT9 empty vector, were able to restore cellular resistance to MMS (Fig.\u00a02B).\nYeast UBC13 functions in an error-free DDT pathway in parallel to the translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) pathway in response to lesions that block replication [34]. While mutations in each pathway cause moderate sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, double mutations defective in both pathways result in synergistic effects [36]. Figure\u00a03 shows that in the presence of 0.001% MMS, neither ubc13\u2206 nor rev3\u2206 single mutants displayed increased sensitivity; however, the ubc13\u2206 rev3\u2206 double mutant did not grow at all in the gradient plat\nassay. Under the same experimental conditions, expression of any of the eight GAL4BD-BnUBC13 genes, but not GAL4BD alone, was able to rescue the double mutant to the level indistinguishable from the wild-type or single mutants (Fig.\u00a03). The above observations collectively demonstrate that B. napus UBC13 genes can functionally complement the yeast ubc13\u2206 mutant from killing by DNA-damaging agents.\nBnUBC13 genes protect ubc13 cells from\u00a0spontaneous mutagenesis Yeast UBC13 is a member of the error-free DDT pathway and plays an important role in protecting yeast cells from spontaneous mutagenesis [33, 34]. Therefore, a spontaneous mutagenesis assay was performed to determine whether BnUBC13s could functionally complement the error-free DDT defect in the yeast. It was apparent from Fig.\u00a0 4 that inactivation of UBC13 in wild-type yeast cells caused nearly 27-fold increase in the spontaneous mutation rate. The large increase in spontaneous mutagenesis supports a notion that UBC13 plays a vital role in maintaining host genome stability. In contrast, when ubc13\u0394s cells were transformed with BnUBC13s, the spontaneous mutation rate dropped to near wild-type levels. These results indicate that BnUbc13s can replace Ubc13 in yeast cells to limit endogenous DNA-damage stress."

            "text": "One condition for the yeast Ubc13 function is that it has to form a stable complex with Mms2, the only known UEV in yeast cells [12]. The fact that BnUbc13s can replace yeast Ubc13 in spontaneous and DNA-damage induced functions indicates that it must interact with Mms2 in yeast cells. To ask whether BnUbc13s are also able to interact with plant UEVs, a yeast two hybrid (Y2H) assay [37] was employed to analyze the proteinprotein interaction between BnUbc13s and AtUev1D. All eight Gal4BD-BnUbc13s gave positive results with Gal4AD-AtUev1D under high stringency (SD-His + 3-AT and SD-Ade) conditions in comparison to negative controls including Gal4BD-BnUbc13s with Gal4AD and Gal4BD with Gal4AD-AtUev1D (Fig.\u00a0 5). All the above interactions are deemed robust and strong, and no difference in the interaction strength among BnUbc13s was observed. Indeed, these interactions seem to be specific between BnUbc13s and AtUev1D as neither of the proteins alone was able to activate reporter genes in the Y2H assay. Therefore, results from the Y2H assay indicate that all BnUbc13s are able to physically interact with AtUev1D.\nThe physical interaction between BnUbc13 and AtUev1D was further confirmed independently\nin\u00a0 vitro by a GST-affinity pulldown assay. In this experiment, bacterial cells were transformed with both His6-tagged BnUbc13s and GST-tagged AtUev1D, and the produced proteins in bacterial cells were copurified by adding to a column containing glutathione beads. After incubation, washing and elution, all eight His6-BnUbc13s were found to be co-eluted with GST-AtUev1D, but not with GST (Fig.\u00a0 6). Hence, all BnUbc13s can form stable heterodimers with AtUev1D in\u00a0vitro.\nDual rescue of\u00a0yeast ubc13 mms2 by\u00a0BnUBC13s and\u00a0AtUEV1D To assess in\u00a0 vivo complex formation and functions between BnUbc13s and AtUev1D, the ubc13 mms2 double mutant was created and co-transformed with pGBT-BnUBC13s and pGAD-AtUEV1D, or with their respective empty vectors. When the double mutant cells were transformed with only pGBT-BnUBC13s or pGAD-AtUEV1D, the transformed cells did not display enhanced resistance to MMS (Fig.\u00a0 7), implying that both Ubc13 and UEV are required for the DDT function. In contrast, double mutant cells carrying both pGBT-BnUBC13 and pGAD-AtUEV1D plasmids displayed MMS resistance comparable to the wildtype level (Fig.\u00a07). Since BnUBC13s and AtUEV1D can jointly complement ubc13\u0394 and mms2\u0394 defects in yeast, one can envisage that BnUbc13s must be able to bind AtUev1D in yeast cells to form a functional E2 complex and promote K63-linked polyubiquitination on PCNA [13], which is a highly conserved process within eukaryotes including plants [38].\nBnUbc13 mediates K63\u2011linked polyubiquitination with\u00a0AtUev1 in vitro To directly examine whether BnUbc13s can promote K63-linked poly-Ub chain assembly, we performed an\nin\u00a0 vitro Ub conjugation assay with selected BnUbc13s. To date, Ubc13 is the only known E2 capable of catalyzing K63-linked polyubiquitination; however, Ubc13 alone is insufficient and requires a UEV as a cofactor [12]. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 8, in our reconstituted Ub conjugation assay, neither BnUbc13s alone (Fig.\u00a08A, lanes 2, 6 and 10; Fig.\u00a08B, lanes 3 and 7) nor AtUev1D alone (Fig.\u00a08A, lanes 3, 7 and 11; and Fig.\u00a08B, lanes 3 and 7) was able to catalyze the poly-Ub chain formation. When both BnUbc13s and AtUev1D are present (Fig.\u00a0 8A, lanes 1, 5 and 9; Fig.\u00a08B, lanes 1 and 5), free poly-Ub chains are formed. These poly-Ub chains are deemed to be K63-linked, since when Ub was replaced by Ub-K63R, the poly-Ub chain formation was completely abolished (Fig.\u00a0 8A, lanes 4, 8 and 12; Fig.\u00a08B, lanes 4 and 8). These results demonstrate that BnUbc13s and AtUev1D can jointly form K63-linked poly-Ub chains in\u00a0vitro."

            "text": "In this study, we identified 12 UBC13 genes from the B. napus genome. Most non-plant eukaryotic organisms contain only one UBC13 gene [39]. Characterized diploid plant genomes contain either one [40] or two [21, 41, 42] UBC13 genes. Hence, it is surprising that the amphidiploid B. napus contains 12 UBC13 genes. Although their DNA sequences vary, the encoded BnUbc13s are highly\nconserved with no more than 3 amino acid differences. Furthermore, five BnUbc13s are identical in sequence with AtUbc13B, while the two amino acid variations found in AtUbc13A were not shared by any BnUbc13s, supporting a previous speculation through phylogenetic analysis that AtUbc13A was derived from gene duplication after Arabidopsis speciation [40]. Similarly, the remaining seven BnUBC13 genes encoding BnUbc13 variants were likely evolved within the Brassica genus. It remains interesting what evolutionary pressure caused sequential UBC13 gene duplications in B. rapa and B. oleracea, and then in B. napus.\nIn this study, we cloned BnUBC13 genes encoding all BnUbc13 variants and characterized their functions in budding yeast. The only known function of yeast UBC13 to date is its involvement in error-free DDT, which is achieved by promoting K63-linked polyubiquitination of PCNA at the K164 residue [13] that promotes template switch to bypass replication-blocking lesions [35]. This study demonstrated that BnUBC13s can functionally complement the yeast ubc13 null defect in error-free DDT. Firstly, heterologous expression of BnUBC13s rescued ubc13\u2206 and ubc13\u2206 rev3\u2206 cells from killing by DNA-damaging agents, indicating that they function in DDR. Secondly, BnUBC13s could also limit the increased spontaneous mutagenesis in ubc13\u2206 cells, suggesting that they protect cells from genome instability under non-stressed conditions. This study also demonstrated physical interactions between BnUbc13s and AtUev1 by Y2H and GST pulldown assays, as well as by a dual rescuing experiment in which BnUbc13s must interact with AtUev1 in yeast cells to restore the DDT function, hence confirming that they form stable heterodimers in\u00a0 vitro and in\u00a0 vivo. Finally, selected BnUbc13 proteins were used in an in\u00a0 vitro Ub conjugation assay, which demonstrated that only in the presence of both BnUbc13\nand AtUev1 could free poly-Ub chains be formed, and that these chains were K63 linked. In addition, the dual rescue experiment of yeast ubc13\u2206 mms2\u2206 mutant cells by BnUBC13s and AtUEV1D also implies that the BnUbc13-AtUev1D heterodimer must promote PCNA polyubiquitination to confer error-free DDT functions. Although this study did not use a UEV from B. napus, the facts that, like Ubc13s, eukaryotic UEVs are also highly conserved and that BnUbc13s could physically interact with both AtUev1 and yeast Mms2 to promote K63linked polyubiquitination support a notion that B. napus Ubc13s and UEVs also form stable heterodimers to promote K63-linked polyubiquitination and are required for plant DDR.\nAll assays employed in this study did not reveal qualitative or quantitative difference among all BnUbc13s, which is not surprising, since they are highly conserved in sequence with very few amino acid variations and that all amino acid residues with functional implications are identical. Indeed, plant UBC13 appears to be a housekeeping gene, particularly when the plant genome contains only one UBC13 gene [40]. However, the similarity in biochemical activity does not necessarily mean that all BnUBC13 genes function equally and redundantly, as one cannot rule out possibilities that these genes contain different promoter sequences and display different spatial and temporal expression patterns, particularly in response to environmental stresses.\nPlant Ubc13-Uev1 complexes are not only required for DDR, but also for other agriculturally related processes. It appears that in multicellular organisms, UEVs serve as regulatory subunits to alter substrate specificity. In human cells, two UEVs, Uev1A and Mms2 contain different N-terminal extension and function in NF-kB activation and DDR, respectively [43]. Plants also contain two classes of Uev1s with different C-terminal extension and cellular activities [44]. We are particularly interested in roles of plant Ubc13 and its mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination in auxin signaling [23, 25, 45], nutrient metabolism [24] and innate immunity against pathogen infections [26, 27, 46], as alteration of these processes may improve quality and yield of the oilseed crop."
