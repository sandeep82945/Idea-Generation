    "abstractText": "Ras proteins are membrane-bound GTPases that regulate essential cellular processes at the plasma membrane (PM). Constitutively active mutations of K-Ras, one of the three Ras isoforms in mammalian cells, are frequently found in human cancers. Ferrocene derivatives, which elevate cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), have shown to block the growth of nonsmall cell lung cancers harboring oncogenic mutant K-Ras. Here, we tested a novel ferrocene derivative on the growth of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Our compound, which elevated cellular ROS levels, inhibited the growth of K-Ras-driven cancers, and abrogated the PM binding and signaling of K-Ras in an isoform-specific manner. These effects were reversed upon antioxidant supplementation, suggesting a ROS-mediated mechanism. We further identified that K-Ras His95 residue plays an important role in this process, and it is putatively oxidized by cellular ROS. Together, our study demonstrates that the redox system directly regulates K-Ras/PM binding and signaling via oxidative modification at the His95, and proposes a role of oncogenic mutant K-Ras in the recently described antioxidant-induced growth and metastasis of K-Rasdriven cancers.",

Constitutively active mutations of K-Ras, one of the three Ras isoforms in mammalian cells, are frequently found in human cancers. Ferrocene derivatives, which elevate cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), have shown to block the growth of nonsmall cell lung cancers harboring oncogenic mutant K-Ras. Here, we tested a novel ferrocene derivative on the growth of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Our compound, which elevated cellular ROS levels, inhibited the growth of K-Ras-driven cancers, and abrogated the PM binding and signaling of K-Ras in an isoform-specific manner. These effects were reversed upon antioxidant supplementation, suggesting a ROS-mediated mechanism. We further identified that K-Ras His95 residue plays an important role in this process, and it is putatively oxidized by cellular ROS. Together, our study demonstrates that the redox system directly regulates K-Ras/PM binding and signaling via oxidative modification at the His95, and proposes a role of oncogenic mutant K-Ras in the recently described antioxidant-induced growth and metastasis of K-Rasdriven cancers.\nDOI 10.26508/lsa.202302094 | Received 12 April 2023 | Revised 23 August 2023 | Accepted 24 August 2023 | Published online 4 September 2023"

            "text": "Ras proteins are a family of small GTPases primarily localized to the plasmamembrane (PM) and function asmolecular switches, cycling between a GDP-bound inactive state and a GTP-bound active state (McCormick, 2016; Chen et al, 2021). In response to activation by upstream receptor kinases, guanine exchange factors bind to Ras to facilitate the release of GDP and binding of GTP, which confers Ras the active conformation for binding its downstream effectors (McCormick, 2016; Chen et al, 2021). Ras proteins are involved in a variety of cellular pathways that regulate cell differentiation,\nproliferation, and survival (Jancik et al, 2010; Chen et al, 2021). GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) promote Ras GTPase activity, enhancing Ras-induced GTP hydrolysis to GDP (McCormick, 2016; Chen et al, 2021). There are three Ras isoforms that are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells: K-, H-, and N-Ras. K-Ras undergoes alternative splicing on the fourth exon, yielding K-Ras4A and K-Ras4B, where K-Ras4B, hereafter K-Ras, is the predominant K-Ras protein expressed in mammalian cells (Cox et al, 2014). Constitutively active mutations of Ras are found in ~19% of all human cancers, with ~75% of those being K-Ras (Prior et al, 2020). Oncogenic mutant K-Ras are found in ~88% pancreatic, ~50% colorectal, and ~30% of lung cancers (Prior et al, 2020), and a group of newly developed K-Ras G12C direct inhibitors have shown promise in clinical trials. Sotorasib and adagrasib are FDA-approved small molecules that directly bind to the GDP-bound K-Ras G12C mutant and form a covalent bond to the mutant Cys, which locks K-Ras in the inactive conformation, thereby blocking its signaling (Ostrem et al, 2013; Canon et al, 2019; Hallin et al, 2020). Although these inhibitors exhibit pronounced anti-cancer effects in K-Ras G12C tumor mice models and in clinical trials (Canon et al, 2019; Hallin et al, 2020), the K-Ras G12Cmutation is found only in ~3% pancreatic, ~4% colorectal, and ~13% of lung cancers that harbor any oncogenic mutations in K-Ras, making it effective against only a small subset of the K-Ras-driven cancers (Cox et al, 2014; Prior et al, 2020).\nOne of the strategies for blocking pan-oncogenic mutant K-Ras activity is to dissociate it from the PM. Experimental data show that K-Ras, regardless of mutation status, activates its downstream effectors primarily at the inner PM leaflet, and that dissociating K-Ras from the PM blocks K-Ras signal output and the growth of K-Ras-driven cancers (Cho et al, 2012b, 2016a, 2016b; van der Hoeven et al, 2013; Kattan et al, 2019, 2021; Miller et al, 2019; Tan et al, 2019; Garrido et al, 2020; Kovar et al, 2020). Ras proteins have two targeting signals for stable interaction with the PM. The first signal is the C-terminal CAAX motif that undergoes a series of posttranslational modifications to generate a farnesyl\u2013cysteine\u2013methyl\u2013 ester, allowing Ras binding to cellular membranes (Apolloni et al, 2000; Prior & Hancock, 2012). For H- and N-Ras, the second targeting\n1Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Boonshoft School of Medicine, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, USA 2Department of Chemistry, College of Science and Mathematics, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, USA 3Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, USA 4Department of Integrative Biology and Pharmacology, McGovern Medical School, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX, USA\nCorrespondence: Kwang-jin.cho@wright.edu\n\u00a9 2023 Rehl et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202302094 vol 6 | no 11 | e202302094 1 of 16\non 11 January, 2024life-science-alliance.org Downloaded from http://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202302094Published Online: 4 September, 2023 | Supp Info:\nsignal is palmitoyl moieties adjacent to the farnesylated Cys, conferring their stable PM binding. The second targeting signal of K-Ras is its C-terminal polybasic domain, a stretch of six lysine residues near the farnesyl moiety, which forms favorable electrostatic interactions with phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), an anionic phospholipid enriched in the PM inner leaflet (Hancock et al, 1990; Yeung et al, 2008; Zhou et al, 2017). Recent studies have identified three molecular mechanisms that regulate K-Ras transport to, and interaction with the PM (i) disrupting K-Ras binding to its chaperone protein, phosphodiesterase 6 delta (PDE6\u03b4), (ii) phosphorylating K-Ras at Ser181, and (iii) reducing PM PtdSer content (Gorfe & Cho, 2019; Henkels et al, 2021). Under basal conditions, H-, N-, and K-Ras proteins are farnesylated, and PDE6\u03b4 continuously sequesters Ras proteins from endomembranes via interacting with the prenyl moiety and returns them to the PM. Disrupting this interaction redistributes all three Ras isoforms to endomembranes (Chandra et al, 2012; Zimmermann et al, 2013; Schmick et al, 2014). Also, protein kinase C and G directly phosphorylate K-Ras, but not other Ras isoforms, at Ser181 via independent mechanisms. This perturbs K-Ras PM binding and mislocalizes K-Ras from the PM to endomembranes (Bivona et al, 2006; Cho et al, 2016a; Kovar et al, 2020). The other regulator for K-Ras PM localization is PtdSer enrichment in the inner PM leaflet. Depletion of PM PtdSer by perturbing mechanisms that maintain PM PtdSer abundance dissociates K-Ras from the PM and blocks K-Ras signal output and the growth of human cancers harboring oncogenic mutant K-Ras in vitro and in vivo (Cho et al, 2012b, 2016b; van der Hoeven et al, 2018; Kattan et al, 2021).\nFerrocene derivatives encompass a diverse range of compounds, but they all contain the ferrocene molecule, an iron atom (Fe) sandwiched between two cyclopentadienyl ligands (Kealy & Pauson, 1951; Wilkinson et al, 1952; Gasser et al, 2011). The ferrocene molecule is insoluble and inactive, requiring additional functional groups to enter the cell (Larik et al, 2016; Peter & Aderibigbe, 2019). Once inside, it undergoes a one-electron oxidation, Fe2+ to Fe3+, to form the active ferrocenium cation (Gasser et al, 2011; Larik et al, 2016). The general mechanism of ferrocene derivatives involves the elevation of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce cellular damage and apoptosis (Melendez, 2012; Mojzisova et al, 2014). For example, a ferrocene conjugated to a gold(I)N-heterocyclic carbene complexes elevates cellular ROS by irreversibly binding to and inhibiting thioredoxin reductase, an essential component of the thioredoxin antioxidant system (Arambula et al, 2016). Human cancers harboring oncogenic mutant K-Ras are susceptible to changes in cellular ROS because of their metabolic reprogramming, and ROS-elevating agents are effective in their growth inhibition (Arambula et al, 2016; McCall et al, 2017; Foo & Pervaiz, 2019). Also, ferrocene derivatives exhibit anti-cancer effects in lung cancer cells harboring oncogenic mutant K-Ras (Domarle et al, 1998; Perez et al, 2015; Arambula et al, 2016; Peter & Aderibigbe, 2019). Thus, ferrocene derivatives may be useful for targeting K-Ras-driven cancers.\nIn this study, we developed a novel ferrocene complex, C16H20FeClNO, which inhibits the growth of K-Ras-driven human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. We also discovered that elevation of cellular ROS disrupts the PM binding and signaling of K-Ras, but not other\nRas isoforms, through oxidative modification of K-Ras His95 residue. Moreover, our findings propose an additional role of oncogenic mutant K-Ras in the recently reported antioxidant-induced growth and metastasis of K-Ras-driven NSCLC (Sayin et al, 2014; Lignitto et al, 2019; Wiel et al, 2019)."

            "text": "Our group recently reported a set of chalconesbearing\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl motifs that blocks the growth of PDAC and NSCLC cell lines harboring oncogenic mutant K-Ras by phosphorylating K-Ras at Ser181 (Kovar et al, 2020). Also, ferrocene derivatives have shown to inhibit the growth of NSCLC harboring oncogenic mutant K-Ras via mechanisms that have not been elucidated (Arambula et al, 2016; Larik et al, 2016; Wang et al, 2020). Thus, we envisaged that an ideal drug to target K-Ras-driven cancers could be designed by combining the \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl and ferrocene motifs. To test this, we devised an elegant strategy to fuse these two motifs in a single-pot reaction. Also, we included an ammonium group to increase the solubility in an aqueous solution. Compound 1 was prepared by treating acetylferrocene with a premixed solution of bis(dimethylamino)methane, phosphoric, and acetic anhydride (Fig 1A). After workup, compound 1 was obtained as a crude product, which was purified using column chromatography to yield the pure product as an orange\u2013yellow oil in 71% yield. The obtained product was characterized using 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy to confirm the identity of compound 1 (Fig S1A and B). The resulting oil was further treated with HCl dissolved in diethyl ether to yield pure compound 2 in 95% yield (Fig 1A). The obtained product was subjected to 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and the identity was confirmed using high-resolution mass spectroscopy (MS) and elemental analysis (Fig S1C and D). The obtained compound 2 (C16H20FeClNO) was further subjected to biological studies.\nCompound 2 inhibits the growth of K-Ras-dependent human cancers\nA wide range of human cancers harboring oncogenic mutant K-Ras reprogram their signaling network so that their survival and growth depend on the oncogenic K-Ras signaling, a phenomenon called K-Ras addiction or dependence (Weinstein & Joe, 2008; Singh et al, 2009, 2012; Hayes et al, 2016). To examine if our compound 2 inhibits the growth of K-Ras-dependent human cancers, a panel of human PDAC and NSCLC cell lines, in which their growth are K-Rasdependent or -independent, were grown with compound 2, and cell proliferation was measured. Our data show that the growth of K-Ras-dependent cancer cell lines was more sensitive than K-Rasindependent control cell lines (Fig 1B\u2013E). We further examined Ras signaling by measuring phosphorylated ERK (ppERK) and Akt (pAkt), the two most well-studied Ras downstream effectors, after treating selected PDAC and NSCLC cell lines with high sensitivity for compound 2. Our immunoblot data show that although there is a dose-\nROS blocks K-Ras activity by oxidizing K-Ras His95 residue Rehl et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202302094 vol 6 | no 11 | e202302094 2 of 16\nROS blocks K-Ras activity by oxidizing K-Ras His95 residue Rehl et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202302094 vol 6 | no 11 | e202302094 3 of 16\ndependent reduction of ppERK in BxPC-3 and H522, control cell lines for PDAC and NSCLC, respectively, ppERK level was initially elevated at 10 \u03bcM and showed a trend of decrease at higher concentrations in K-Ras-dependent cell lines (Fig 1F). To further evaluate the ppERK activity, we measured the phosphorylation of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), the cytosolic substrate of ERK1/2 (Hayes et al, 2016). Our data show that although p90RSK phosphorylation followed the trend of ppERK in control cell lines, it was decreased from 10 \u03bcM, the concentration that elevated ERK phosphorylation, in K-Rasdependent cancer cell lines (Fig 1F). A similar observation has been reported, in which ERK inhibitor SCH772984 paradoxically elevates ERK phosphorylation, whereas it reduces p-p90RSK levels in PDAC. This study proposes that kinome reprogramming overcomes the suppression of MEK-induced ERK phosphorylation by the inhibitor, but not ppERK activity (Hayes et al, 2016). Together, our data suggest that compound 2 has a higher selectivity for the growth inhibition of K-Ras-dependent PDAC and NSCLC, and that the compoundmay disrupt the kinome reprogramming, resulting in elevated ERK phosphorylation, but blocks ppERK activity.\nCompound 2 translocates K-Ras from the plasma membrane to endomembranes\nK-Ras conducts signal transduction by stimulating its direct downstream effectors primarily at the PM, and blocking the PM localization abrogates K-Ras signaling and the growth of K-Rasdependent cancers (Cho et al, 2012b, 2016a, 2016b; van der Hoeven et al, 2018; Miller et al, 2019; Garrido et al, 2020; Kovar et al, 2020). To examine if compound 2 perturbs K-Ras/PM binding, we directly measured K-Ras/PM binding by quantitative electron microscopy (EM). Intact basal PM sheets fromMDCK cells stably expressing GFPtagged oncogenic mutant K-Ras (K-RasG12V) or -H-RasG12V and treated with the compound for 48 h were labeled with anti-GFP antibody conjugated to 4.5-nm gold particles and imaged by EM (Prior et al, 2001, 2003). Our data show that the total number of gold particles for GFP-K-RasG12V, but not -H-RasG12V, was significantly decreased after compound 2 treatment (Figs 2A and S2). Ras proteins in the PM are spatially organized into nanoscale domains, called nanoclusters, which are essential for high-fidelity Ras signal transduction (Prior et al, 2003; Tian et al, 2007; Cho et al, 2012a). Thus, we examined the spatial organization of Ras proteins remaining at the PM after compound 2 treatment. Our data show a significant reduction in the nanoclustering of K-RasG12V, but not H-RasG12V, after compound 2 treatment (Fig 2B), suggesting that compound 2 disrupts the PM binding and nanoclustering of K-Ras, but not H-Ras.\nTo further investigate the cellular localization of K-RasG12V after compound 2 treatment, MDCK cells stably co-expressing mCherrytagged CAAX, a generic endomembrane marker (Choy et al, 1999; Cho et al, 2012b), and GFP-K-RasG12V were treated with various concentrations of compound 2 for 48 h and imaged by confocal microscopy. To quantitate the extent of K-Ras translocation from the PM to endomembranes, an IC50 value for Ras/PM dissociation was derived from Manders\u2019 coefficient, which calculates the fraction of mCherry-CAAX co-localized with GFP-K-RasG12V (Manders et al, 1993; Cho et al, 2012b). Our data show that compound 2 translocated K-RasG12V to endomembranes with an IC50 of 0.39 \u03bcM (Fig 2C and E). Our confocal microscopy further shows that the\ncompound did not disrupt the PM localization of GFP-H-RasG12V, -N-RasG12V, and -K-Ras4A G12V (Fig 2D and E). Subcellular fractionation assay further reveals that the membrane-associating K-RasG12V is reduced, whereas the cytosolic K-RasG12V is elevated after compound 2 treatment. No changes were observed with H-RasG12V (Fig 2F and G). We repeated the fractionation assay in wild-type (WT) Panc-1 cell line and measured membrane-bound and cytosolic endogenous Ras isoforms. Our data show that the membrane-bound endogenous K-Ras4B, but not other Ras isoforms, is reduced (Fig 2H).\nTo examine to which cellular organelles themislocalized K-Ras is redistributed, we co-stained cells expressing GFP-K-RasG12V with organelle markers after compound 2 treatment. Our data show that K-RasG12V co-localized with Rab5A-, Rab7A-, LAMP1-, GALNT1-, and ER-tracker\u2013positive structures after the treatment (Fig S3A\u2013D and F), suggesting that compound 2 translocates K-Ras to the early endosome, late endosome, lysosome, the Golgi complex, and ER. K-RasG12V did not co-localize with a mitochondrial protein, PDHA1, indicating K-RasG12V did not translocate to the mitochondria (Fig S3E). Together, our data suggest that compound 2 disrupts K-Ras/ PM binding and nanoclustering of the remaining K-Ras at the PM, but not other Ras isoforms, and that the mislocalized K-Ras translocates to the cytosol and various cellular organelles except the mitochondria.\nCompound 2 blocks the K-Ras/MAPK signaling\nTo investigate if the isoform-specific inhibitory effect on the Ras/ PM localization translates to Ras signaling, MDCK cells expressing GFP-tagged different oncogenic mutant Ras isoforms were treated with compound 2 and probed for ppERK and pAkt (S473). Our data show that compound 2 significantly decreased the level of ppERK, but not pAkt, in a dose-dependent manner only in K-RasG12V\u2013 expressing cells (Fig 3A and B). A previous study reported that K-Ras is a more potent activator of the Raf-1/MAPK signaling than H-Ras, whereas H-Ras is a more potent activator of the PI3K/Akt signaling (Yan et al, 1998). Thus, it is plausible that compound 2 blocks the PM binding and nanoclustering of K-Ras, but not other Ras isoforms, resulting in significant inhibition of the Raf-1/MAPK signaling with minimal effects on the PI3K/Akt signaling. Also, we showed that compound 2 differentially regulates ERK phosphorylation in human cancer cell lines (Fig 1F), another evidence of a more complex signaling network in human cancer cell lines compared with a model cell line.\nWe also measured total K-Ras protein expression because K-Ras/ PM dissociation by various mechanisms differentially regulate K-Ras protein expression (Cho et al, 2012b; van der Hoeven et al, 2013; Garrido et al, 2020). Our data show that the compound did not change the protein expression of Ras isoforms (Fig 3A and B). Moreover, compound 2 did not induce cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP-1, proteins involved in apoptosis (Fig S4), which suggest that the compound does not induce apoptosis at the concentration that blocks K-Ras/PM binding and K-Ras/MAPK signaling. Together with Fig 2, our data suggest that compound 2 inhibits the PM binding, nanoclustering, and MAPK signaling of K-Ras, but not other Ras isoforms.\nROS blocks K-Ras activity by oxidizing K-Ras His95 residue Rehl et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202302094 vol 6 | no 11 | e202302094 4 of 16\nROS blocks K-Ras activity by oxidizing K-Ras His95 residue Rehl et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202302094 vol 6 | no 11 | e202302094 5 of 16\nROS blocks K-Ras activity by oxidizing K-Ras His95 residue Rehl et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202302094 vol 6 | no 11 | e202302094 6 of 16\nCompound 2 disrupts K-Ras/PM binding and signaling via elevating cellular ROS\nBecause ferrocene derivatives elevate cellular ROS levels (AcevedoMorantes et al, 2012; Arambula et al, 2016), we examined if our compound elevates cellular ROS. Briefly, WT MDCK cells were treated with compound 2 in the presence of DCFH2-DA (29,79-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate), a chemically reduced form of fluorescein. Once it enters a cell, esterases convert it to DCFH, which is further metabolized to highly fluorescent DCF upon exposure to cellular ROS, a readout for cellular ROS levels (Acevedo-Morantes et al, 2012). Our data show that compound 2 increased DCF production, whereas co-treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a general antioxidant (Spagnuolo et al, 2006) reversed it (Fig 3C), confirming that compound 2 elevates cellular ROS at the concentration that blocks K-Ras/PM binding and signaling. Previous studies have reported that under oxidative stress, the oxidation of hemecontaining proteins releases free heme, which stimulates degradation of BACH1 (BTB and CNC homology 1), a pro-metastatic transcriptional factor (Zenke-Kawasaki et al, 2007; Lignitto et al, 2019). To examine if compound 2 induces cellular oxidative stress, we measured BACH1 protein level after treating K-Ras-dependent PDAC and NSCLC cell lines with compound 2. Our data show that BACH1 was reduced from 10 \u03bcM, indicative of elevated cellular oxidative stress (Fig 3D). These data suggest that compound 2 elevates cellular ROS and oxidative stress.\nTo validate the role of cellular ROS in K-Ras/PM binding, we tested other chemical modulators that elevate cellular ROS by blocking the glutathione or thioredoxin antioxidant systems. MDCK cells co-expressing mCherry-CAAX and GFP-K-RasG12V or -H-RasG12V were treated with mitomycin C, a thioredoxin reductase inhibitor, carmustine, a glutathione reductase inhibitor or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (An et al, 2011; Paz et al, 2012; Yokoyama et al, 2017), and cellular localization of Ras proteins were imaged. Our data show that these compounds mislocalized K-RasG12V, but not H-RasG12V (Figs 3E and F and S5C). EM analysis further shows that mitomycin C blocks K-Ras/PM binding, nanoclustering, and K-Ras/MAPK signaling (Figs 3G and H and S5A and B). Moreover, subcellular fractionation assay reveals that mitomycin C, carmustine, and a high concentration of H2O2 significantly increased the cytosolic fraction of GFP-K-RasG12V, but not H-RasG12V (Fig 3I and J). Together, our data suggest that compound 2 elevates cellular ROS, which disrupts the PM binding and signaling of K-Ras, but not H-Ras.\nN-acetylcysteine reverts the effects of compound 2\nTo further validate that compound 2 disrupts K-Ras/PM binding and signaling by elevating cellular ROS, we repeated these experiments after NAC supplementation. MDCK cells expressing GFPK-RasG12V were co-treated with NAC and compound 2, mitomycin C or H2O2, and cellular localization of K-RasG12V was imaged. Our confocal and electron microscopy show that NAC supplementation restored K-Ras/PM binding and nanoclustering (Fig 4A\u2013D). Our immunoblot data further show that co-treatment of compound 2 with NAC rescued the abrogated ppERK level in K-RasG12V-expressing cells (Fig 4E). Moreover, NAC supplementation restored the impaired growth of K-Ras-dependent PDAC and NSCLC cell lines (Fig 4F). Of note, although NAC alone elevates K-Ras/PM binding and ERK phosphorylation in K-RasG12Vexpressing MDCK cells, it did not promote the growth of K-Rasdependent cancer cells (Fig 4C, E, and F). Together, our data suggest that compound 2 blocks K-Ras/PM binding, nanoclustering, signaling, and the growth of K-Ras-dependent cancer cells via an ROSmediated mechanism.\nROS-induced K-Ras/PM dissociation is independent of PM PtdSer content and K-Ras Ser181 phosphorylation\nPtdSer is an anionic phospholipid enriched in the inner leaflet of the PM and plays a critical role in the stable K-Ras/PM binding. K-Ras stably binds to the PM via the C-terminal farnesyl moiety in conjugation with the electrostatic interaction between the polybasic domain and the anionic head group of PtdSer (Yeung et al, 2008; Cho et al, 2012b; Zhou et al, 2017). Depletion of PM PtdSer content dissociates K-Ras from the PM and abrogates K-Ras signal output (Cho et al, 2012b, 2016b; Tan et al, 2018; van der Hoeven et al, 2018; Kattan et al, 2019, 2021). Another mechanism regulating the stable K-Ras/PM binding is K-Ras phosphorylation at Ser181 by protein kinase C or G. Stimulated protein kinase C and G phosphorylate K-Ras Ser181 residue, located adjacent to the polybasic domain, which perturbs the electrostatic interaction of K-Ras and the negatively charged cellular membranes, resulting in K-Ras/PM dissociation (Bivona et al, 2006; Cho et al, 2016a; Kovar et al, 2020). To examine if compound 2-induced K-Ras/PM dissociation is via these mechanisms, we studied cellular distribution of GFP-LactC2 (the C2 domain of lactadherin), a well-studied PtdSer probe (Yeung et al, 2008) and -K-RasG12V S181A, where Ser181 is substituted to Ala to prevent it from being phosphorylated. Our confocal microscopy shows that compound 2 treatment had minimal effects on the PM localization of LactC2, whereas K-RasG12V S181A was redistributed\nloading controls. (E) MDCK cells co-expressing mCherry-CAAX and GFP-K-RasG12V or -H-RasG12V were treated with various concentrations of ROS-elevating agents for 48 h, and imaged by confocal microscopy. Representative images of GFP-RasG12V are shown. Inserted values represent an estimated mean fraction of mCherry\u2013CAAX colocalized with GFP-RasG12V calculated by Manders\u2019 coefficient from three independent experiments.

Cell lysates were fractionated into membrane and cytosol fractions, and RasG12V levels were measured by immunoblotting using an anti-GFP antibody. The graphs show the mean membrane-bound fraction \u00b1 SEM of RasG12V, calculated as membrane/(membrane + cytosol) from three independent experiments. (B, C, G, H, I, J) Significant differences between control (DMSO-treated) and drug-treated cells were evaluated by one-way ANOVA tests for (B, C, I, J), t tests for (G), and bootstrap tests for (H) (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001, #, not significant).\nROS blocks K-Ras activity by oxidizing K-Ras His95 residue Rehl et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202302094 vol 6 | no 11 | e202302094 7 of 16\nROS blocks K-Ras activity by oxidizing K-Ras His95 residue Rehl et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202302094 vol 6 | no 11 | e202302094 8 of 16\nROS blocks K-Ras activity by oxidizing K-Ras His95 residue Rehl et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202302094 vol 6 | no 11 | e202302094 9 of 16\nfrom the PM (Fig 5A), suggesting that compound 2-induced K-Ras/PM dissociation is independent of PM PtdSer abundance and of K-Ras Ser181 phosphorylation.\nK-Ras His95 is critical for compound 2-induced K-Ras/PM dissociation\nAlthough H-Ras is oxidatively modified perturbing its activity, little is known about K-Ras oxidative modifications (Heo & Campbell, 2005; Heo et al, 2005; Burgoyne et al, 2012; Messina et al, 2019). Because our data demonstrate that cellular ROS elevation disrupts the PM binding of K-Ras, but not H-Ras, which is reversed by NAC supplementation, we hypothesized that ROS oxidatively modifies K-Ras, blocking K-Ras/PM binding and signaling. There are five amino acid residues that can be oxidatively modified and are unique to K-Ras (bold in Fig 5B). To identify the exact amino acid residue regulated by cellular ROS, we first generated MDCK cells stably expressing GFP-tagged C-terminal hypervariable region of K-Ras (GFP-CTK), sufficient for K-Ras transport to and stable interaction with the PM (Apolloni et al, 2000), and imaged its cellular localization after compound 2 treatment. We found that the compound had no effect on the PM localization of GFP-CTK (Fig 5C), suggesting that the target residue must be located within the G-domain. In the G-domain, K-Ras contains His at the 95th position, which can be oxidatively modified (this position is Gln in H-Ras, which does not get oxidatively modified). His95 is solvent-exposed in the crystal structure of K-Ras (Fig S6), and previously reported molecular dynamic simulations suggest His95 would still be accessible to solvent, and hence to ROS when K-Ras is bound to a model membrane (Prakash et al, 2016, 2019). To examine if His95 is involved in the ROS-induced K-Ras/PM dissociation, we substituted His with Ala, which does not undergo oxidative modification. MDCK cells expressing GFP-K-RasG12V H95A were treated with compound 2, and K-Ras cellular localization was studied by confocal and electron microscopy. The compound had no effect on the PM binding and nanoclustering of K-RasG12V H95A (Fig 5D and F). We further substituted the Gln95 of H-Ras to His and studied its cellular localization after compound 2 treatment. Whereas Gln95His mutation did not alter the PM binding and nanoclustering of H-RasG12V under basal conditions (Fig S7), compound 2 treatment abrogated the PM binding and nanoclustering of H-RasG12V Q95H, and this effect was reversed by NAC\nsupplementation (Fig 5E and G). Moreover, to evaluate the role of K-Ras His95 residue on cancer growth, K-Ras-dependent PDAC cell lines ectopically expressing GFP-K-RasG12V or -K-RasG12V H95A were treated with compound 2 for 3 d, and their proliferation was measured. Our data show that the growth of cells expressing GFPK-RasG12V H95A was less sensitive to compound 2, compared with K-RasG12V\u2013expressing cells (Fig 5H and I). These data suggest that the His95 residue is important for the ROS-induced K-Ras/PM dissociation and growth inhibition of K-Rasdependent cancers.\nTo directly examine if the His95 residue is oxidized by compound 2, GFP-K-RasG12V was immunopurified from MDCK cells expressing GFP-K-RasG12V and treated with compound 2 or H2O2 for 48 h. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis was performed and MSn fragmentation spectra suggest that although the peptide matching K-Ras His95 oxidation was detected, the fragments corresponding to the oxidized His residues were not detected. It is hypothesized to be a result of known issues with His oxidation and collision-induced dissociation fragmentation (Srikanth et al, 2009). Although the fragments were not directly detected, these data provide indirect evidence for oxidation at K-Ras His95 after compound 2 and H2O2 treatment (Fig 5J). Because His94 and His95 are the only His residues within the peptide (Fig 5B), and the PM binding of K-Ras His95Ala mutant is not changed by compound 2 (Fig 5D and F), our data support the induction of oxidation at K-Ras His95 by cellular ROS. Together, our data suggest that cellular ROS regulates K-Ras/PM binding, nanoclustering, signaling, and the growth of K-Ras-dependent cancer growth by oxidation at K-Ras His95 residue."

These effects were reversed by supplementation of NAC, a general antioxidant. Moreover, NAC alone enhances K-Ras/PM binding and K-Ras signaling without altering its PM nanoclustering. Although previous studies have reported the roles of K-Ras signaling on regulating redox balance,\nresidues unique to K-Ras are in bold.

The isolated protein was digested and subjected to liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. The spectra represent the fragmentation of the K-Ras peptide (amino acid residues 89\u201397) from cells treated with compound 2 (upper panel) and H2O2 (lower panel). Fragmentation generates C9\u2013N9 (b-ions in red) and N9\u2013C9 (y-ions in blue). The differences between peaks correspond to amino acids of the sequence.

Under oxidative stress, BACH1 is degraded by free heme released by the oxidation of hemecontaining proteins (Zenke-Kawasaki et al, 2007; Lignitto et al, 2019). Prolonged supplementation of antioxidants reduces cellular ROS levels, which lowers cellular free heme, stabilizing BACH1 protein. The elevated BACH1 further promotes glycolysis by upregulating transcription of GAPDH and hexokinase-2, promoting metastasis in K-Ras-driven NSCLC (Wiel et al, 2019) (Fig 6). Consistently, promoting the endogenous antioxidant program either by activating NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2), the master transcriptional regulator of antioxidant responses, or blocking its negative regulator, KEAP1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1), up-regulates heme oxygenease-1, which degrade free heme, resulting in the BACH1-dependent metastasis of K-Rasdriven NSCLC (Li & Stocker, 2009; Wiel et al, 2019). Moreover, prolonged treatment of antioxidants, NAC or vitamin E stimulates the growth of K-Ras-driven NSCLC via disrupting the ROS\u2013p53 axis (Sayin et al, 2014). Thus, these studies have demonstrated the role of antioxidants in the ROS/p53-regulated growth of and the BACH1/ glycolysis-mediated metastasis of K-Ras-driven NSCLC, and our study adds the pivotal role of oncogenic K-Ras in this signal axis. We have showed that compound 2 promotes BACH1 degradation in K-Ras-dependent PDAC and NSCLC cell lines, and NAC alone promotes K-Ras/PM binding and ERK phosphorylation in a model cell line. We further provided indirect evidence that cellular ROS oxidatively modifies K-Ras at His95 residue, and the growth of cancer cells ectopically expressing K-RasG12V H95A were resistant to compound 2. Together, we propose that in K-Ras-driven NSCLC and possibly PDAC, elevation of cellular antioxidants prevents the oxidative modification of the His95 residue of oncogenic mutant K-Ras, promoting stable K-Ras/PM binding, and thereby the MAPK signaling, which results in elevated cell proliferation. This elevated K-Ras signaling further promotes NRF2 expression, stimulating the NRF2-mediated antioxidant program (Singh et al, 2008; DeNicola et al, 2011; Yang et al, 2021). This in turn, provides a positivefeedforward loop for the antioxidant/BACH1/glycolysis-induced metastatic signaling. The enhanced K-Ras signaling also promotes glycolysis andmetastasis pathways (Ying et al, 2012; Cox et al, 2014; Gorfe & Cho, 2019), further stimulating the antioxidant/ BACH1/glycolysis-induced NSCLC metastasis (Fig 6). However, one of caveat with our model is that NAC treatment for 3 d did not stimulate the growth of K-Ras-dependent cancer cells (Fig 4F). We speculate that NAC treatment for 3 d may be insufficient timeframe to reprogram signal network for translating NAC-promoted K-Ras/ PM binding and K-Ras signal output to cell proliferation in human cancer cells. For example, K-RasG12D-expressing primary fibroblasts were treated with NAC for 12 d to show elevated cell proliferation (Sayin et al, 2014).\nWe have identified K-Ras His95 as a novel amino acid residue for regulating K-Ras/PM binding via oxidative modification. Although the exactmechanisms on how oxidativemodification of K-Ras His95 perturbs the PM binding needs to be further elucidated, the observations that ROS elevation does not affect the PM binding of\nK-Ras4A, which also has His95, and that Gln95His substitution dissociates H-Ras from the PM (Figs 2 and 5) provide a hint into the possible involvement of the PDE6\u03b4-Arl2/3 transport machinery. PDE6\u03b4 continuously sequesters K-Ras and depalmitoylated H- and N-Ras from endomembranes via interacting with their C-terminal farnesyl moiety. The release factors Arl2 and 3 then bind the Ras/ PDE6\u03b4 complex and release Ras to perinuclear membranes for returning to the PM (Ismail et al, 2011; Chandra et al, 2012; Schmick et al, 2014). Although PDE6\u03b4 does not bind depalmitoylated K-Ras4A likely because of steric hindrance caused by two Lys residues immediately before the C-terminal farnesylated Cys of K-Ras4A, PDE6\u03b4 directly interacts with five amino acids (residues 180\u2013184) immediately before the farnesylated Cys of K-Ras for the stable binding (Dharmaiah et al, 2016). Thus, it is plausible that oxidatively modified His95 of K-Ras may perturb Arl2/3 interaction with the K-Ras/PDE6\u03b4 complex, resulting in K-Ras distribution from the PM to endomembranes.\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates that redox system directly regulates K-Ras/PM binding and K-Ras signal output via oxidative modification at His95, and proposes a role of oncogenic mutant K-Ras in the antioxidant-induced growth and metastasis of K-Rasdriven cancers."
