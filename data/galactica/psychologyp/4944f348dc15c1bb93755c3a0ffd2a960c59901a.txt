While conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is central to the evaluation of patients with multiple sclerosis, its role in detecting the pathophysiology underlying neurodegeneration is more limited. One of the common outcome measures for progressive multiple sclerosis trials, atrophy on brain MRI, is non-specific and reflects end-stage changes after considerable neurodegeneration has occurred. Identifying biomarkers that identify processes underlying neurodegeneration before it is irreversible and that reflect relevant neurodegenerative pathophysiology is an area of significant need. Accumulating evidence suggests that oxidative stress plays a major role in the pathogenesis of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, includingmultiple sclerosis. Imagingmarkers related to inflammation, myelination, and neuronal integrity have been areas of advancement in recent years but oxidative stress has remained an area of unrealized potential. In this articlewewill begin by reviewing the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis ofmultiple sclerosis. Chronic inflammation appears to be directly related to the increased production of reactive oxygen species and the e ects of subsequent oxidative stress appear to be amplified by aging and accumulating disease. We will then discuss techniques in development used in the assessment of MS as well as other models of neurodegenerative disease in which oxidative stress is implicated. Multiple blood and CSF markers of oxidative stress have been evaluated in subjects with MS, but non-invasive imaging o ers major upside in that it provides real-time assessment within the brain.

Frontiers inNeurology 01 frontiersin.org conclusions OS is a key pathophysiological mechanism underlying neurodegeneration in MS. Because of the complexity of the OS pathways, multiple potential targets to capture OS using in vivo imaging techniques have emerged. High spatial resolution methods using MRI offer advantages in the evaluation of MS such as assessing regional or lesional differences in OS. Contrast agents like nitroxides and mito-TEMPO are T1 contrast agents with anti-oxidant properties that penetrate the brain and mitochondria to distribute to tissues where ongoing OS occurs, thus highlighting regional areas with an abundance of ROS. Techniques with high spatial resolution offer the advantage of obtaining more granular regional or lesional variation in OS. A direct measure of overall ROS burden would also be advantageous in the context of MS as opposed to a technique that measures a single ROS, such as glutathione in the case of MRS. In this respect, 62Cu-ATSM may offer a sensitive marker that measures OS comprehensively but with a sacrifice in spatial resolution. At present, MRS investigations of glutathione have the most robust literature in the context of MS, but it does have low spatial resolution and requires specific expertise in analysis which has slowed broad uptake of this method. 62Cu-ATSM PET appears to be primed for investigations of MS with multiple other studies in neurodegenerative disease, however PET has limitations in spatial resolution that are not ideal.
