In the research of industrial clusters and innovation systems, the linear idea of reductionism becomes more and more powerless as the research dimension increases and the research difficulty gradually increases. With the effective application of complex systems theory in the field of natural science research, more and more scholars also consider it as an effective tool in the field of innovation management research [4\u20136]. With the development of system theory, new theories such as quantum theory, synergy theory, dissipative structure theory, and catastrophe theory have opened new doors for us to study socially complex systems. ey can address complex features that cannot be explained by reductionism, especially the dynamic interaction behavior of subjects in industrial clusters and innovation systems.
