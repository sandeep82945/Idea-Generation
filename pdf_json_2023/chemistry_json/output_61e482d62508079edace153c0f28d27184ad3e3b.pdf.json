    "abstractText": "To remove typical herbicide diuron effectively, a novel sludge-derived modified biochar (SDMBC600) was prepared using sludge-derived biochar (SDBC600) as raw material and Fe-Zn as an activator and modifier in this study. The physico-chemical properties of SDMBC600 and the adsorption behavior of diuron on the SDMBC600 were studied systematically. The adsorption mechanisms as well as practical applications of SDMBC600 were also investigated and examined. The results showed that the SDMBC600 was chemically loaded with Fe-Zn and SDMBC600 had a larger specific surface area (204 m2/g) and pore volume (0.0985 cm3/g). The adsorption of diuron on SDMBC600 followed pseudo-second-order kinetics and the Langmuir isotherm model, with a maximum diuron adsorption capacity of 17.7 mg/g. The biochar could maintain a good adsorption performance (8.88\u201312.9 mg/g) under wide water quality conditions, in the pH of 2\u201310 and with the presence of humic acid and six typical metallic ions of 0\u201320 mg/L. The adsorption mechanisms of SDMBC600 for diuron were found to include surface complexation, \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 binding, hydrogen bonding, as well as pore filling. Additionally, the SDMBC600 was tested to be very stable with very low Fe and Zn leaching concentration \u22640.203 mg/L in the wide pH range. In addition, the SDMBC600 could maintain a high adsorption capacity (99.6%) after four times of regeneration and therefore, SDMBC600 could have a promising application for diuron removal in water treatment.",

            "text": "Diuron, a typically substituted urea herbicide, causes plants to wither by inhibiting photosynthesis. It is widely employed for the treatment of gramineous and some broadleaved grasses [1]. Due to its complex and stable structure and long half-life, diuron is often detected in the effluent from municipal sewage treatment plants, surface water, and groundwater at different concentrations [2]. For example, diuron has been detected in UK (6742 ng/L) [3], Brazil (50\u20137800 ng/L) [4], and Japan (2.18 \u00b5g/L) [5]. Diuron has been characterized as a potential mutagenic/carcinogenic chemical by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) [6]. Previous research has revealed the carcinogenic effect of diuron on rats as well as the cytotoxicity and potential genotoxicity on humans [7]. In addition, due to its increasing threat to human health, diuron was added to\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2868. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28062868 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2868 2 of 18\nthe priority list of pollutants for the water policy area in the European Commission, and the European Union has set the maximum allowable concentration of diuron in drinking water at 0.1 \u00b5g/L [8]. In this context, it is essential to adequately treat diuron-contaminated water. Currently, the methods employed to treat diuron in water comprise the advanced oxidation process (AOPs), biological methods, membrane filter methods, and adsorption [9\u201312]. Although AOPs have shown good removal efficiency, the high energy and catalyst consumptions make this treatment method difficult to apply in practical water treatment engineering projects [13]. Although the biological methods can effectively remove diuron in water, water solution conditions (such as temperature and pH) affect adversely the effectiveness [9]. The membrane filter method has a high removal rate for diuron, but the high costs and issues with concentrated water of membrane filtration make it largely impractical [14]. As an efficient and environmentally friendly method [15], the adsorption method requires an expensive adsorbent, which limits its use [16]. Research for environmentally friendly, economic, sustainable, and highly efficient adsorbent is of importance [17]. Municipal excess activated sludge is a major solid waste of municipal sewage treatment. With the advancement of the world economy and urbanization, the excess activated sludge of urban sewage treatment plants increases year by year. At present, the excess activated sludge is generally treated by landfill or incineration. Such a treatment is prone to cause resource waste and secondary pollution [18], and is not in line with the global conception of carbon reduction and resource utilization of waste. Instead, the excess activated sludge is a kind of waste biomass material containing organic matter and nutrients as well as certain metal salts. Thus, the excess activated sludge can be potentially used for producing biochar. Using the residual activated sludge to prepare sludge biochar (SDBC) as an adsorbent has the advantages of waste reuse and high cost-efficiency. This can resultantly reduce the secondary pollution of the excess activated sludge and improve environmental safety. Studies of SDBC for removing organic pollutants from water have been reported recently. For example, the adsorption of atrazine by SDBC was studied [19]. However, the original SDBC had limited adsorption performance for atrazine because of its low number of functional groups, lack of pore capacity, and small specific surface area. Studies on sludge-modified biochar have also been reported but with only limited success. For example, Liu et al. [20] used magnetic biochar prepared by co-pyrolysis of zero-valent iron nanoparticles and sewage sludge to remove Cr(VI) from water, with an adsorption capacity of 11.56 mg/g. Therefore, it would be useful if a better modification method could be established. Modification by metal ions is a common method of biochar modification. For example, Iron(III) is one of the most widely used media for modifying biochar because it increases the specific surface area and facilitates magnetic separation [21,22]. A study showed that the adsorption capacity of Fe-modified lignin biochar for removing methylene blue in wastewater could be 2.7 times greater than that of the unmodified original lignin biochar [23]. In addition, zinc salts were also found to be effective and low-cost modifiers for improving the pore structure and increasing the specific surface area of biochar for enhanced micropollutants adsorption [24]. In a previous study, the adsorption property of the bamboo biochar modified with ZnCl2 was tested to be 4.4 times greater than that of the original bamboo biochar [25]. The metal modification enables biochar to obtain more adsorption sites and a larger surface area, which solves the effective recovery of biochar after adsorption. However, the metal modification will cause the exudation of metal ions of biochar and pollute water. Moreover, Fe-Zn modified biochar could combine the advantages of two kinds of modified material, which is an effective adsorbent to remove organic synthetic raw material (P-nitrophenol [26]), heavy metals (Pb(II) [27], Cd(II) [28]), and antibiotics (tetracycline [29]) from wastewater. Additionally, bimetallic modification can improve the safety of biochar and reduce the leakage of metal ions. However, the preparation of sludge-derived modified biochar (SDMBC) using Fe-Zn has not been reported, and the adsorption efficiency and mechanism of diuron from water by SDMBC are unclear.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2868 3 of 18\nTherefore, the present study aimed at preparing a novel and efficient Fe-Zn modified sludge biochar for the adsorption of diuron in an aqueous solution.

The total pore volume of SDMBC600 (0.0985 cm3/g) was 2.58 times that of SDBC600 (0.0382 cm3/g). This may be due to the effect of ZnCl2 on the pore formation during carbonization, which increased the pore volume of the modified biochar [24].

The H/C ratio raised from 0.116 for SDBC600 to 0.166 for SDMBC600, while the content of C decreased from 22.98% for SDBC600 to 20.62% for SDMBC600 (Table S2). The carbonization degree of biochar could be evaluated by its H/C [32]. The H/C data indicated that SDMBC600 was less carbonized than SDBC600 in the study. Generally, (N+O)/C could be applied to assess the numbers of polarity groups in biochar. If the (N+O)/C ratio of biochar was low, this indicates that its polarity was low and aromatic hydrocarbons were strong [31]. In addition, O/C could be employed to estimate the hydrophilicity of biochar [31]. If the O/C ratio was decreased, this suggests that oxygenic functional groups (carbonyl and carboxyl) were reduced, which was in favor of improving biochar stability [33]. As shown in Table S2, the O/C ratio of SDMBC600 was reduced to 0.85 from 0.91 of SDBC600, while the (N+O)/C ratio of SDMBC600 was reduced to 0.97 from 1.04 of SDBC600. The results showed that SDMBC600 was more stable with higher aromaticity and lower polarity than SDBC600. FTIR had been applied for determining the functional groups of SDBC600 and SDMBC600 (see Figure 1e). The results indicated that the main functional groups of SDBC600 were \u2212OH, O=C\u2212O, C\u2212O\u2212C, C\u2212H, and Si\u2212O\u2212Si. The peaks of Fe\u2212O (588 cm\u22121) and Zn\u2212O (618 cm\u22121) of SDMBC600 appeared after the modification with FeCl3/ZnCl2. The O=C\u2212O antisymmetric stretching vibration (1462 cm\u22121) and C\u2212H (900 cm\u22121) disappeared, while the intensity of C\u2212O\u2212C (1082 cm\u22121) decreased significantly. These results indicated that Fe-Zn oxides loading on biochar resulted in the change of its functional groups. After the second calcination, the functional group C=C (1662 cm\u22121) of SDMBC600 was enhanced, suggesting that the stability of modified biochar (SDMBC600) was significantly improved. In the XRD analyses of SDBC600, the diffraction peak at 26.60\u25e6 belonged to the typical graphite carbon structure (see Figure 1f). The peaks at 26.64\u25e6 and 36.55\u25e6 were matched to the characteristic peaks of the (011) and (110) planes of quartz (SiO2, PDF 99\u20130088). Peaks at 23.06\u25e6, 29.40\u25e6, 35.97\u25e6, 39.41\u25e6, 43.162\u25e6, 47.50\u25e6, and 48.51\u25e6 were matched to the characteristic peaks of the (012), (104), (110), (113), (202), (018), and (116) planes of calcite (CaCO3, PDF 99\u20130022). For SDMBC600, the peak at 35.43\u25e6 matched the characteristic peaks of the (311) plane of Fe3O4 (PDF 99\u20130073), and the peaks at 32.56\u25e6 and 36.25\u25e6 matched the characteristic peaks of the (104) plane of ZnCO3 (PDF 99\u20130095) and the (101) plane of ZnO (PDF 99\u20130111), respectively. The above results also indicated that Fe-Zn was chemically loaded onto SDMBC600.\n2.2. Adsorptive Processes 2.2.1. Adsorption Kinetics\nFigure 2 displays the kinetic adsorption curve of SDBC600 and SDMBC600. The adsorption capacity of diuron by SDBC600 and SDMBC600 achieved an adsorption balance within 6 h, with adsorption capacities of 2.55 and 6.67 mg/g, respectively. The diuron adsorption capacity of SDMBC600 was 2.62 times that of SDBC600, which is likely due to its richer pore structure, greater specific surface area, and more adsorption sites (Table S1). The results showed that SDMBC600 had an enhanced removal efficiency and ability of diuron. Three adsorption kinetic models have been applied for matching the diuron adsorption by SDBC600 and SDMBC600. In contrast to the other two models (Table 1), the pseudosecond-order kinetic model was best fitted to the adsorption behavior of the biochar, especially for SDMBC600. Most likely, the adsorption of diuron by SDMBC600 was mainly by chemisorption [34]. It was reported that the chemisorption was represented by the Elovich model, which assumed that the surface of the adsorbent was heterogeneous [35]. In the present study, the R2 > 0.99 in the fitted data parameters of the Elovich model, so supporting the assumption that the rate-controlling process for the adsorption of diuron onto SDMBC600 was chemisorption [36].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2868 6 of 18\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2868 6 of 18\nFigure 2.

Effects of Solution pH and Coexisting Substances\nAt a pH of 2, the adsorption capacity of SDMBC600 for diuron was low (Figure 5a), which seems to be caused by the disruption of the structure of SDMBC600 under strong acidic solution conditions. The pH values showed an insignificant effect on the adsorption of diuron by SDMBC600 when the pH of he aqueous solution was greater than 3. This indicates that it could be used in a wide pH range.

Therefore, SDMBC600 as an adsorbent used for water treatment has good adaptability to solution pH. Metal ions and natural organic matter such as humic acids (HA) are often present in real wate samples, which may interfere with th adsorption of diuron. C sidering the typical coexisting substances in natural water bodies and referring to the previous literature [30,43], six metal ions (Cu2+, Ca2+, Cr6+, K+, Mg2+, Pb2+) and HA were selected as coexisting substances in this study to investigate the adsorption and removal of diuron (initial concentration of 10 mg/L) by SDMBC600 (see Figure 5b). It was found that the ad-\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2868 10 of 18\nsorption of diuron by SDMBC600 was inhibited only in the presence of high concentrations of Cu2+, Cr6+, and Pb2+ (>5 mg/L). This may be due to the competitive adsorption between metal ions and diuron [44]. Another reason may be that ions enter the diffusion bilayer on the surface of SDMBC600, which reduces the repulsive force between biochars. This result is in the formation of a denser aggregate structure for the biochar, which is not favorable for diuron adsorption [45]. Interestingly, in the presence of Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, and low concentrations of Cu2+, Cr6+, and Pb2+ (<5 mg/L), the adsorption of SDMBC600 to diuron was promoted. This may be due to the salting-out effect, which reduces the solubility of the diuron and promotes the diffusion of the diuron on the surface of SDMBC600, thus increasing the adsorption capacity of the diuron on SDMBC600 [46]. In the study, the inhibition rates of metal ions on diuron adsorption ranged from 2.53% to 23.16%. Compared with the previous studies by Nguyen et al. [33] (50%) and Cao et al. [44] (>80%), SDMBC600 had better environmental adaptability and ionic interference resistance. This result indicated that SDMBC600 could adapt certain interferences from metal ions during the adsorption of diuron. Molecules 2023, 28, 2868 10 of 18\nFigure 5.

Different letters indicate significant differences between different treatments at the 0.05 level, testing by one-way ANOVA.\nMetal ions and natural organic matter such as humic acids (HA) are often present in\nreal water samples, which may interfere with the adsorption of diuron. Considering the\ntypical coexisting substances in natural water bodies and referring to the previous litera-\nture [30,43], six metal ions (Cu2+, Ca2+, Cr6+, K+, Mg2+, Pb2+) and HA were selected as coex-\nisting substances in this study to investigate the adsorption and removal of diuron (initial\nconcentration of 10 mg/L) by SDMBC600 (see Figure 5b). It was found that the adsorption\nof diuron by SDMBC600 was inhibited only in the presence of high concentrations of Cu2+,\nCr6+, and Pb2+ (>5mg/L). This may be due to the competitive adsorption between metal\nions and diuron [44]. Another reason may be that ions enter the diffusion bilayer on the\nsurface of SDMBC600, which reduces the repulsive force between biochars. This result is\nin the formation of a denser aggregate structure for the biochar, which is not favorable for\ndiuron adsorption [45]. Interestingly, in the presence of Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, and low concentra-\ntions of Cu2+, Cr6+, and Pb2+ (<5 mg/L), the adsorption of SDMBC600 to diuron was pro-\nmoted.

Firstly, compared with SDBC600, SDMBC600 has a greater specific surface area and a higher number of mesopores. The experimental results suggest that the co-modification of Fe-Zn could significantly enhance the pore expansion and specific surface area, thereby enhancing the adsorption of diuron. Secondly, with the decrease of (N+O)/C and H/C in SDMBC600, the aromatic compounds in SDMBC600 were increased, which enhanced the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 binding between SDMBC600 and diuron [30]. The surface morphology and surface chemical composition of SDMBC600 after adsorption were evaluated by SEM-EDS (see Figure S2).

This implies that diuron molecules may be adsorbed on the surface of SDMBC600 through pore-filling.

Comparing the FTIR spectra of SDMBC600 before and after the adsorption of diuron, the interaction between biochar and diuron could be inferred.

The results showed that water samples 2 and 4 promoted the adsorption of diuron by SDMBC600, while water samples 1 and 3 inhibited the adsorption of diuron by SDMBC600. This was likely due to the higher total organic carbon (TOC) in the real water samples 1 and 3, with the presence of more organic aromatic compounds in the two water samples, they would compete with diuron in solution to reduce the adsorption capacity of diuron on SDMBC600 [44]. Secondly, according to the results of the coexistence ion experiment above, the presence of calcium ions in solution could promote the adsorption of diuron by SDMBC600. This indicates that\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2868 13 of 18\nthe real water samples matrix had some insignificant influence on the adsorption of diuron by SDMBC600. In general, SDMBC600 can still achieve good adsorption efficiency for diuron under real water quality conditions. According to the above research, SDMBC600 also has certain adsorption capacity in the actual wastewater.\n2.5.3. Stability and Regeneration\nIn order to explore the safety of SDMBC600 in practical applications, the leaching concentrations of iron and zinc were measured at pH 3, 5, 7, and 10 (see Figure S3). The results showed that the leaching concentrations of iron and zinc decreased with the increase of solution pH value. When the pH value among 5 to 10, the leaching concentration of Fe (0.0525\u20130.203 mg/L) and Zn (0.00975\u20130.0310 mg/L) was lower than the limits for the concentration of 0.3 mg/L and 1.0 mg/L in the Standards for Drinking Water Quality in China (GB5749-2022), respectively. Only when the pH value was 3, was the leaching concentration of Fe greater than 0.3 mg/L. It showed that SDMBC600 was chemically stable and environmentally safe in a wide pH range. Sorbent regeneration could give biochar a low-cost advantage. The regeneration combination of ultrasonic and organic solvents (methanol, ethanol, acetone, etc.) is an effective adsorbent regeneration method. In this research, SDMBC600 was regenerated by ultrasonic and ethanol co-treatment. SDMBC600 could be effectively regenerated by ultrasonicethanol co-treatment and maintain good regeneration adsorption performance during the repeated adsorption cycle. The adsorption capacity at four adsorption\u2013regeneration cycles is still 99.6% of the first adsorption capacity (Figure S4). The regeneration effect of SDMBC600 is better than that of previous studies (44.5% and 76.25%) [30,44]. It can be seen that the adsorption capacity of the first three regeneration cycles of SDMBC600 was better than that of the new preparation SDMBC600. This might be caused by the fact that ultrasound could open the pore size and ethanol could change the surface functional groups of SDMBC600. Similar results had been obtained in relevant studies [53]. The results showed that SDMBC600 could still achieve an ideal regeneration property in multiple regeneration cycles through ultrasonic and ethanol co-treatment."
