1. **Investigate the effects of different SL ratios on the degradation of other harmful algal species:** The study focused on the degradation of cyanobacteria using different ratios of lactonic and acidic SLs. Future research could explore the effectiveness of these SL ratios against other harmful algal species, such as dinoflagellates and diatoms, to determine the broad-spectrum applicability of SLs in harmful algal bloom control.


2. **Evaluate the environmental impact of SLs on aquatic ecosystems:** While SLs have been shown to be biodegradable and environmentally friendly, their potential impact on non-target organisms and the overall aquatic ecosystem needs further investigation. Future studies could assess the effects of SLs on aquatic biodiversity, including zooplankton, fish, and macroinvertebrates, to ensure their safe and sustainable use in bloom control.


3. **Explore the potential of SLs in combination with other bloom control methods:** SLs could be used in conjunction with other bloom control strategies, such as physical removal, chemical treatments, or biological control agents, to enhance their effectiveness and reduce the risk of resistance development. Future research could investigate synergistic effects between SLs and other control methods, optimizing bloom management strategies.


4. **Investigate the genetic basis of SL production and degradation in cyanobacteria:** Understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying SL production and degradation in cyanobacteria could provide insights into their ecological roles and potential vulnerabilities. Future studies could focus on identifying and characterizing the genes involved in SL metabolism, exploring the regulation of these genes, and investigating the genetic diversity of SL-producing and SL-degrading cyanobacteria.


5. **Develop SL-based biosensors for early detection and monitoring of harmful algal blooms:** SLs could be utilized as sensing elements in biosensors for the early detection and monitoring of harmful algal blooms. Future research could focus on developing SL-based biosensors that can rapidly and sensitively detect specific algal toxins or bloom-related biomarkers, enabling timely intervention and bloom management.
