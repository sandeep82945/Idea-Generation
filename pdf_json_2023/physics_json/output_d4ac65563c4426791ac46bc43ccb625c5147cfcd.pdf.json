This task is challenging due to the nonlinear nature and discrete structure inherent in CRNs. To address this, we employ an information geometric approach, using the natural gradient, to develop a nonlinear system that yields an upper bound for CRN dynamics. We validate our approach through numerical simulations, demonstrating faster convergence in a specific class of CRNs. This class is characterized by the number of chemicals, the maximum value of stoichiometric coefficients of the chemical reactions, and the number of reactions. We also compare our method to a conventional approach, showing that the latter cannot provide an upper bound on reaction rates of CRNs. While our study focuses on CRNs, the ubiquity of hypergraphs in fields from natural sciences to engineering suggests that our method may find broader applications, including in information science.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nOver the past three decades, extensive research has been dedicated to understanding stochastic and information thermodynamics, specifically focusing on bounds related to entropy production and various physical quantities [1\u20134]. This trajectory persists, with newer studies shedding light on thermodynamic uncertainty relations [5\u20139] and establishing thermodynamic bounds on cross-correlations [10\u201312]. Parallel to the work on physical systems, researchers have also explored bounds in non-physical realms such as biological systems. For example, limits concerning population growth have been studied [13\u201318].\nRecent studies have unveiled the geometric structure of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) and have also extended these concepts to the domain of general hypergraphs [19\u201321]. Concurrently, topological analyses on CRNs and hypergraphs have been performed [22\u201325]. Despite these advancements, the intrinsic nonlinearity in CRNs presents a significant challenge for elucidating specific properties, leaving gaps in our understanding.\nInformation geometry offers a framework that applies differential geometry to probability distributions, facilitating the exploration of their geometric structures [26, 27]. Among its significant contributions is the concept of the natural gradient (NG) [28], which has demonstrated effectiveness in optimization problems, particu-\n\u2217 mizohata.tsuyoshi.t8@elms.hokudai.ac.jp \u2020 tetsuya@sat.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp \u2021 louis.bouchard@gmail.com \u00a7 miyahara@ist.hokudai.ac.jp, hmiyahara512@gmail.com; corresponding author.\nlarly in the realm of machine learning. Additional studies have ventured into the acceleration of information gradient flows [29] and have investigated the biological significance of gradient flows [30]. Research has also extended to constraints involving rates of statistical divergences and mutual information [31]. These diverse applications underline the versatility of information geometry, which we leverage in this study.\nIn the present work, we explore the upper bound on reaction rates in general CRNs using NG. Initially, we present a geometrical description of CRN dynamics [20, 21]. Subsequently, we categorize CRNs according to the number of chemicals involved, the maximum coefficients in the reactions, and the total number of reactions. Utilizing this classification, we formulate a nonlinear system that provides an upper bound on reaction rates for a given class of CRNs. Through numerical simulations, we find that our system exhibits a steeper gradient, facilitating faster convergence. Importantly, this fast convergence minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to zero. In contrast, conventional CRNs often maintain a nonzero KL divergence due to nontrivial equilibrium points. We also note that conventional methods are insufficient for achieving these results, underscoring the uniqueness of our approach.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Sec. II, we furnish an overview of CRNs. Section III elucidates the challenges of establishing an upper bound on CRNs using Newton\u2019s method. Section IV is dedicated to explaining NG. In Sec. V, we introduce a dynamical system that serves as an upper bound for CRNs in a specified class. Numerical simulations are presented in Sec. VI. In Sec. VII, we provide discussions on our findings.

In the case of a CRN, each hypervertex vi is composed of a combination of chemicals X1,X2, . . . ,XNX and given by\nvi := \u03b31,iX1 + \u03b32,iX2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ \u03b3NX,iXNX .

In general, when a CRN involves multiple chemical reactions, the\nstoichiometric matrix provides a concise representation of the relationships between the reactants and products. The stoichiometric matrix S is also expressed as S = \u2212\u0393B.

(4.8)\nNote that \u2206t in Eq. (4.1) is set to unity in the conventional formulation of NG; in the following section, we will impose a specific relationship between \u2206t and \u03f5 in Eq. (4.1) to connect NG and CRNs.\nTo find the solution of Eq. (4.3), we employ the method of Lagrange multipliers where the Lagrange function reads\nL(\u2206x, \u03bb) := \u2202xf(xt) \u22ba\u2206x\u2212 \u03bb\n2 (\u2206x\u22baG\u03d5\u2032(xt)\u2206x\u2212 \u03f5).\n(4.9)\nThe derivative of Eq. (4.9) with respect to \u2206x takes the following form:\n\u2202\n\u2202\u2206x L(\u2206x, \u03bb) = \u2202xf(xt)\u2212 \u03bbG\u03d5\u2032(xt)\u2206x. (4.10)\nThen, the solution of Eq. (4.10) is given by\n\u2206x = 1\n\u03bb G\u22121\u03d5\u2032 (xt)\u2202xf(xt). (4.11)\nThe derivative of Eq. (4.9) with respect to \u03bb has the following form:\n\u2202 \u2202\u03bb L(\u2206x, \u03bb) = \u22121 2 (\u2206x\u22baG\u03d5\u2032(xt)\u2206x\u2212 \u03f5) (4.12)\n= 0. (4.13)\nTaking Eq. (4.11) into account, the solution of Eq. (4.13) is written as\n\u03bb2 = \u2202xf(xt)\n\u22baG\u22121\u03d5\u2032 (xt)\u2202xf(xt)\n\u03f5 . (4.14)\nCombining Eqs. (4.11) and (4.14) and taking account of the nature of the minimization problems, the solution of Eq. (4.3) takes the following form:\n\u2206xt(\u03f5) = \u2212 \u221a\n\u03f5\n\u2202xf(xt)\u22baG \u22121 \u03d5\u2032 (xt)\u2202xf(xt)\nG\u22121\u03d5\u2032 (xt)\u2202xf(xt).\n(4.15)\nNote that \u03d5\u2032(\u00b7) in Eq. (4.15) may be different from \u03d5(\u00b7) appearing in Sec. II. In the case of CRNs, f(xt) in Eq. (4.15) representsDKL(xt\u2225x\u0302). As shown in Eq. (4.15), \u03f5 is a key parameter in NG. From the perspective of applying NG to CRNs, the relationship between \u03f5 in NG and \u2206t in CRNs, when discretized, is still missing. Therefore, NG cannot be directly applied to CRNs. In the following section, we will explain how to address this challenge and develop a general upper bound on the dynamics of CRNs."

            "text": "In this study, we developed a framework based on NG to establish an upper bound on the dynamics of a specific subset of CRNs. The physical meaning of this bound relates to the concept of entropy production, which in turn is related to the speed of convergence of the chemical reaction. The nonlinearity commonly present in CRNs presents a challenge, which is addressed here. The optimization problem in the NG derivation was found to be related to entropy production, enriching the understanding of NG within a thermodynamic context. While the primary focus has been on CRNs, the methods and discussions are applicable to a wider range of hypergraph dynamics. The study holds implications for fields beyond chemistry and physics, including information science and machine learning."
