            "text": "The natural arrangements of a relatively small number of spherical magnets are a great source of inspiration for experimental classroom demonstrations ofmagnetostatic problems in general, and bifurcations between static equilibrium states in particular. Smith et al. discuss a filled hexagonal arrangement based on seven spherical permanent magnets [1]. Their experimental investigation is compared with a mathematical model based on dipole-dipole interactions, which nicely explains the physics of this magnetostatic problem. Within a certain range of their control parameter \u2013 the strength of the central dipole relative to the perimeter dipoles of the hexagonal arrangement \u2013 they find bistability. This bistable range is bounded by two instabilities leading to discontinuous jumps of the dipole arrangement. This comment clarifies the nature of these instabilities."

It shows the bistable range of the control parameter between the two bifurcations at 1 \u2248 1.1545 and 2 \u2248 2.4724. The dipolar and thecircular state are stable within 1 < < 2. They werecalculated here with a relaxation code that was developed for studying a similar magnetic cluster problem [2], and is described in detail in another comment [3]. Due to the symmetries of these stable states, only three angles, e. g., 3, 4,and 5, are necessary to characterize the circular state, andeven one angle is sufficient to describe the dipolar state unambiguously. In Figs. 0(a) \u2013 (c), 3, 4, and 5 are shown as a func-tion of . In addition to the two stable branches, we also show two unstable branches that are necessary and sufficient to understand the bifurcations. The first unstable branch is\nORCID(s): 0000-0002-0036-0394 (S. V\u00f6lkel); 0000-0003-0629-0865 (S. Hartung); 0000-0001-7511-2910 (I. Rehberg)\nthe continuation of the circular state. It has been traced using the function \u2019root\u2019 from SciPy [4]. We name it \"unstable circular state\" and plot the corresponding ( ) as a dashed light blue line. The second unstable state bifurcates at 1from the dipolar state, breaking its symmetry and destabilizing the highly symmetric dipolar state for < 1. Wename this branch \"subcritical branch\", because it emerges as a subcritical bifurcation from the dipolar state. The arrangement of all seven dipoles for the fourmodes of interest within this comment is shown for the middle of the bistable range, namely at ( 1+ 2)\u22152, and is presented in the form of insets.Both unstable branches have the symmetries of the circular state.\nBy visual inspection of the ( )-curves, the two bifurcations of interest can most clearly be seen in the plot of 4( ).The circular state extends to 2. Of course, it does not sim-ply end here: It folds over into its unstable branch shown as a dashed gray line in this comment. The instability of the ensuing dipolar state with 4 = 0and its higher symmetry ( 5 = \u2212 3) is also visible here:At 1, a symmetry breaking solution branches off from thedipolar state. It bends over into the stable range of the dipolar solution, i. e., it is a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation. Being unstable itself, it destabilizes the dipolar state for < 1.Such a symmetry breaking subcritical pitchfork bifurcation comes with two branches, which are mirror images of each other with respect to the symmetry they break. In the mirrored branch, \u2212 4 replaces 4, and 3 and 5 change theirrole. Fig. 0 shows only a shorter part of the mirrored branch for clarity.\nA natural order parameter for transitions between the dipolar and the circular state is the toroidal magnetic moment mtor = \u2211\ni pi \u00d7 mi as described, e. g., in Ref. [5]. The z-component of this vector is shown in Fig. 0(d). It must start from the value 6 for = 0, because the six dipole orientations 1,..,6 are perpendicular to their corresponding location p1,..,6 here. For clarity, the symmetric counterparts with neg-ative toroidal moments are omitted. The fold can nicely be\nS. V\u00f6lkel, S. Hartung, I. Rehberg:, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmmm.2022.169520 Page 1 of 2\nHysteretic transition in a dipole cluster\nseen with this order parameter. Fig. 0(d) also demonstrates that the unstable circular state \u2013 destabilizing the dipolar state at 1 \u2013 does not have the higher symmetry of the dipolarstate. The latter can be characterized by mtor = 0.The magnetic potential energy U of the four states is shown in Fig. 0(e). The energies of the dipolar branch Udipand the subcritical branch Usub meet at 1, and the stablebranch Uc,s of the circular state coincides with the unstablebranch Uc,u at 2. The fundamentally different nature of thetwo bifurcations leads to distinctive energy difference scalings when approaching the corresponding critical point. For the subcritical bifurcation one expectsUsub\u2212Udip \u221d ( \u2212 1)2by analysis of the corresponding normal form of this bifurcation [6]. The scaling is best demonstrated visually when plotting the square root of the energy difference in Fig. 0(f), which leads to a finite slope of the line starting from zero at 1. For the fold we expect Uc,u \u2212Uc,s \u221d ( 2 \u2212 )3\u22152, a semi-cubic parabola, reminiscent of the scaling near a cusp catastrophe [7]. This scaling is best demonstrated visually when plotting the energy difference raised to the power of 2/3, which leads to the corresponding straight line in Fig. 0(f)."

The most precise way to vary experimentally is presumably the use of an additional coil around the central dipole. A pure mechanical modification might be to lower the central dipole from above into the plane of the hexagonal ring. Some implications of the ensuing 3d-scenario are discussed in [8]. The bifurcations would change quantitatively \u2013 the 3d-aspect has been added to version 1.2.1 of the interactive Python demonstration of this scenario [9]."
