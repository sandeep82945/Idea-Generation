    "abstractText": "\u2022 Purpose: The aim of this study was to systematically review clinical studies on the employed definitions of longitudinal forearm instabilities referred to as Essex-Lopresti (EL) injuries, interosseous membrane (IOM) injuries or longitudinal radioulnar dissociation. \u2022 Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science and Cochrane databases, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. All data on diagnosis and treatment were collected. \u2022 Results: In total, 47 clinical studies involving 266 patients were included. Thirty-nine of 47 studies did not mention an IOM lesion as part of the EL injury. The amount of preoperative positive ulnar variance varied from >1 to >12 mm. Nine studies used some form of dynamic pre-operative or intraoperative test of longitudinal radioulnar instability. \u2022 Conclusions: There is no accepted definition of EL injury in the literature. In order to prevent underdetection of acute EL injury, a radial head fracture in a patient with wrist and/or forearm pain should raise awareness of the possibility of an EL injury. In this case, comparative radiographic studies and some form of dynamic assessment of longitudinal radioulnar stability should be performed.",

All data on diagnosis and treatment were collected. \u2022 Results: In total, 47 clinical studies involving 266 patients were included. Thirty-nine of 47 studies did not mention an IOM lesion as part of the EL injury. The amount of preoperative positive ulnar variance varied from >1 to >12 mm. Nine studies used some form of dynamic pre-operative or intraoperative test of longitudinal radioulnar instability. \u2022 Conclusions: There is no accepted definition of EL injury in the literature. In order to prevent underdetection of acute EL injury, a radial head fracture in a patient with wrist and/or forearm pain should raise awareness of the possibility of an EL injury. In this case, comparative radiographic studies and some form of dynamic assessment of longitudinal radioulnar stability should be performed."

            "text": "Forearm joint stability is thought to be conferred by three constraints (1): the proximal radioulnar joint (PRUJ), the interosseous membrane (IOM) and the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). With the forearm thus considered as a single anatomical, articulating unit, a traumatic longitudinal instability of this \u2018joint\u2019 was first described by Peter EssexLopresti in 1951 (2). It is caused by a usually high-energy, longitudinal compression vector that dissipates through the three joints of the forearm, resulting in a complex of lesions that probably starts with a transverse rupture of the central band of the IOM (3). While the IOM is a group of multiple ligaments including the accessory band, distal oblique bundle, proximal oblique cord and the dorsal oblique accessory cord, the central band is considered to be the part which most strongly resists longitudinal and transverse radioulnar forces (4).\nAccording to Soubeyrand\u2019s locker-based classification, lesions of two of the three forearm constraints (PRUJ, IOM and DRUJ) lead to a transverse radioulnar instability, with resultant loss of forearm rotations if both lesions are not addressed properly (5). Examples of such lesions include\nGaleazzi\u2019s fracture (distal radial shaft fracture with DRUJ dislocation), Monteggia\u2019s fracture (proximal ulnar fracture with PRUJ and radiocapitellar joint dislocation) and crisscross injuries (concomitant PRUJ dislocation and DRUJ dislocation with intact forearm bones and intact IOM) (6). However, longitudinal forearm instability only results when there is a lesion of all three constraints.\nUnfortunately, missing the initial diagnosis in the latter situation can lead to a chronic, progressive, proximal radial migration and DRUJ dislocation that is hard to treat while harboring substantial functional deficits (7, 8). Therefore, exactly defining Essex-Lopresti (EL) injury is very important, especially in the acute setting. However, while EL injury has been given considerable attention in the recent orthopedic literature (9), diagnostic criteria do not seem to be used uniformly throughout the literature, probably due to its rarity in clinical practice.\nWe aimed to systematically review clinical studies on the employed definitions of longitudinal forearm instabilities referred to as EL injuries, IOM injuries or longitudinal radioulnar dissociation (LRUD). Additionally, we aimed to establish if the definition used affected reported outcome 1 year after surgical treatment.

Biomechanical studies, consensus statements and surveys were excluded. For clarity, only cases with proximal longitudinal forearm instability, that is, with proximal 1/3 radial shaft bony pathology as part of the cause of the instability, were included. Importantly, patients with only transverse radioulnar instability, such as Galeazzi fractures, Monteggia fractures and crisscross lesions, were excluded. Also, patients with multiple traumatic lesions of the forearm other than osteoligamentous structures, such as tendon injuries, were excluded."

Based on our comprehensive search, there is an absolute lack of agreement on both nomenclature, clinical definitions and radiological definitions of EL injury in the literature.\nIn our review, more than half of the studies did not mention any definition and 39 of 49 studies did not mention an IOM lesion as part of the injury. This is considered remarkable, because tardy treatment of these injuries leads to substantially worse outcomes compared to early treatment (22, 52, 56). Treatment of acute cases typically involves stabilization of the proximal radius (osteosynthesis or arthroplasty) and of the DRUJ. There is currently insufficient evidence regarding an additive effect of IOM repair/reconstruction in these cases (9).\nDue to high variability not only in definitions of EL injury but also in the outcome measures, assessment of whether there was a relation between definition and outcome was unrealistic. Part of the observed high variability in the employed definitions (especially the cutoff value for positive ulnar variance) may be caused by authors reporting on actual observations instead of reporting on upfront-stated definitions. While this confounding factor\nmay be a limitation of our review, it even more delineates a lack of consensus and possibly a lack of understanding on (early) clinical diagnosis of EL injury.\nFor the latter, more knowledge on distinguishing clinical features of EL injury is paramount, especially in the acute phase. In those studies reporting on clinical features (less than half of the studies), most patients had some form of forearm or DRUJ-derived pain on clinical examination, and these signs merit further investigations. In the setting of a proximal radial fracture, Fontana\u00a0et\u00a0al. used the C-Fingers comparative test for diagnosing IOM rupture and the tilt test for diagnosing DRUJ instability (56). To more specifically appreciate the value of these signs, we would recommend future authors to report the clinical features of their EL injury patients in detail.\nIn case of clinical suspicion, longitudinal instability may be detected by observing radial shortening on elbow radiographs (contact between radial neck and capitellum) and comparative wrist radiographs (positive ulnar variance) and DRUJ incongruency on wrist radiographs. As is evident from our review, a cutoff value for the amount of ulnar shortening at the level of the wrist is unknown and is further obscured by the variability of ulnar variance among patients. Therefore, we recommend (i) to take bilateral wrist radiographs and (ii) to also specifically look for DRUJ widening. Still, in the acute setting, there may be no radiographic signs of radioulnar incongruency, while in fact longitudinal radioulnar instability is present.\nStatic instability can indirectly be assessed on MRI. The pitfall is that IOM and/or DRUJ injury may be mistaken for longitudinal radioulnar instability. For example, Hausman\u00a0 et\u00a0 al. found partial IOM lesions in 9 of 14 patients with Mason 1 radial head fractures, with good results after early mobilization (57). So, not all additional injuries as diagnosed on MRI do need surgical treatment. However, Grassman\u00a0 et\u00a0 al. have suggested that rupture of the IOM merits K-wire DRUJ stabilization in addition to\nTable 3 Radiographic preoperative and intraoperative criteria for EL injury used in the literature.\nAcute studies (n)\nChronic studies (n) Total studies (n)\nPreoperative Radiographic positive ulnar\nvariance >1 mm 1 0 1 >2 mm 2 0 2 >3 mm 1 2 3 >4mm 0 2 2 >6 mm 1 1 2 >10 mm 0 2 2 >12 mm 0 1 1 Ultrasound IOM rupture 1 3 4 Axial stress test 1 0 1 Muscle hernia sign 3 0 3 MRI IOM edema/rupture 2 0 2 DRUJ abnormalities* 1 1 2 Muscle hernia sign 1 0 1 Intraoperative Radius pull test 5 2 7 Joystick test 3 0 3\n*Abnormalities: edema, triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) rupture, incongruity.\nDownloaded from Bioscientifica.com at 01/25/2024 08:24:18PM via Open Access.

They reported good results using this protocol (58). Still, it is formally unknown if these patients really had a dynamic longitudinal instability and, so, if some of these patients could be at risk of being overtreated.\nA more dynamic way to detect longitudinal instability is US. As infrequently reported as MRI by different authors, US is mostly used to detect IOM tears, similar to MRI. However, Fontana\u00a0 et\u00a0 al. reported the use of a US axial stress test to assess for dynamic instability in case of the absence of static radial proximal migration (56). As MRI detects injury and US detects instability, we would opt for studying the diagnostic value of both MRI and dynamic US (axial stress test) in patients with radial head fractures and wrist pain.\nThe gold standard for longitudinal radioulnar instability is an intraoperative radius pull test, even though the defined cutoff value of radial shortening (\u22653 mm, during a 20 lb longitudinal pull) is based solely on a cadaveric study (59).\nQuite surprisingly, although regarded as a golden standard, the test was only reported in 5 of 19 studies on acute cases. The radius joystick test was only used in three papers, while reported to have a high diagnostic accuracy (13). Although the term LRUD suggests that they key issue is longitudinal instability, the joystick test mainly assesses transversal instability. Yet, it could be a more sensitive test (3).\nThe variability in treatment strategies was even higher in studies reporting on chronic cases, while more recent studies tended to employ IOM reconstructions and some form of DRUJ reduction in addition to the radial head treatment. Unfortunately, with the multitude of clinical definitions and the quite inconsistent reporting of outcome measures (Supplementary Appendix 2), we were unable to make any comparisons between treatments. For future studies, we recommend reporting at least on range of motion of the elbow, forearm and wrist, and patient\u2019s satisfaction.\nIn conclusion, there is no clear and accepted definition of EL injury in the literature. In order to prevent underdetection of acute EL injury, a radial head fracture in a patient with wrist and/or forearm pain should raise awareness of the possibility of an EL injury. Comparative radiographic studies and some form of dynamic assessment of longitudinal radioulnar stability should be performed to complete the assessment and avoid late diagnosis and treatment.\nSupplementary materials This is linked to the online version of the paper at https://doi.org/10.1530/EOR22-0066.\nICMJE Conflict of Interest Statement The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the research reported.\nFunding Statement This work did not receive any specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sector."
