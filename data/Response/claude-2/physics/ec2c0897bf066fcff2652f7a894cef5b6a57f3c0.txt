 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further investigate the molecular determinants of entropy-enthalpy compensation in the activation energy of the oxygen evolution step. This could involve experimentally determining activation entropy/enthalpy for PSII from various organisms and with genetically modified H-bond networks. Computationally model how amino acid changes affect the H-bond network dynamics.

2. Use advanced spectroscopic techniques like 2D-IR to directly observe the structural dynamics of the H-bond network during the S3 to S0 transition. See if an optimal network configuration can be detected right before oxygen evolution. 

3. Explore whether Marcus theory can be adapted to better account for protein-internal H-bond network fluctuations. Develop modified ET theories that incorporate molecular-level solvent effects.

4. Study other redox protein systems that have extended H-bond networks around their active sites. Examine if their kinetics show entropic contributions indicative of multiple accessible configurations.

5. Further investigate the possibility of concerted electron-proton transfer in the oxygen evolution step. Use kinetic isotope effects and computational modeling of proton tunnels to assess proton transfer limitations.
