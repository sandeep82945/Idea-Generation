In this study, we report on the multilevel resistive switching characteristics in SnSe/SrTiO3(STO) heterojunction-based memory devices with silver (Ag) and copper (Cu) top electrodes. The SnSe/STO-based memory devices present bipolar resistive switching (RS) with two orders of magnitude on/off ratio, which is reliable and stable. Moreover, multilevel state switching is achieved in the devices by sweeping voltage with current compliance to SET the device from high resistance state (HRS) to low resistance state (LRS) and RESET from LRS to HRS by voltage pulses without compliance current. With Ag and Cu top electrodes, respectively, eight and six levels of resistance switching were demonstrated in the SnSe/SrTiO3 heterostructures with a Pt bottom electrode. These results suggest that a SnSe/STO heterojunction-based memristor is promising for applications in neuromorphic computing as a synaptic device.",

            "text": "With the development of the modern world, human society has entered a new era of big data and the Internet of Things (IoT), which brings great challenges and demands to computers for data processing [1,2]. As the demand for high-performance computers increases, the traditional Von Neumann architecture computer becomes less efficient since it separates the memory and calculation modules, leading to large and complicated hardware, high energy consumption, and long memory accessing time [3,4]. Resistive randomaccess memory (RRAM) is considered as one of the most desirable devices for emerging computer architecture due to its smaller size, faster response, higher endurance, nonvolatile characteristics, and multilevel storage potential [5\u20138]. For RRAMs, they can be classified into two types by their working mechanisms: valence change mechanisms (VCM) triggered by the drift-diffusion of oxygen anions and electrochemical metallization mechanism (ECM) relying on the electrochemical dissolution and deposition of active electrode metals [9\u201314]. Both mechanisms play significant roles in resistive switching devices, and more studies are being carried out to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms. Recently, it was found that, beyond those active metals, semiconductors can be used as a buffer layer between the metal electrode and the insulating layer in the memory devices, leading to interesting switching performance [3\u20135,8,15,16]. The performance of such complicated heterostructures may significantly change the memory characteristics such as operation voltage, resistance ratio, and multilevel storage performance etc., especially when choosing unconventional materials such as perovskite oxides SrTiO3 (STO) and BaTiO3 (BTO) as switching layers [17\u201322].\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 2128. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12132128 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 2128 2 of 12\nSTO is a potential candidate for the next generation of high-k gate dielectric materials due to its large dielectric constant, low dielectric loss, and potential ferroelectricity under strain [23\u201325]. For RRAMs with STO thin films epitaxially grown on silicon, or a heterostructure of doped STO films on a Nb-doped STO substrate, their resistance on/off ratios are only in the range between 1 and 100 [18]. These low resistance ratios may be increased by stacking with a semiconducting buffer layer, forming a heterojunction structure. A heterostructure may also make the device achieve a much higher resistance ratio and even multilevel resistive switching. In order to explore the switching mechanism and induce multilevel resistance states in the STO thin film-based device stacking with other semiconductor materials and different top electrodes, in this work, we report on SnSe/STO heterostructure-based memristor devices where the SnSe thin film is constructed in metal\u2013insulator\u2013metal (MIM) sandwich structures with Ag and Cu as top electrodes. Stoichiometric SnSe is a narrow band gap semiconductor at 0.9\u20131.3 eV, with relatively high resistance and a low-density of intrinsic defects [26]. These properties may make the SnSe memory device multifunctional through the integration of light sensitivity [27,28] and the ability to harvest energy from heat [29,30]. Our previous results show that SnSe is a good candidate for ultralow switching and multimode memristors [31]. In this work, for the first time, we demonstrate multilevel switching performance and resistive switching characteristics by inserting a SnSe film on a STO thin film to form a double layer heterostructure memristor device. We also studied the switching mechanism and compared the performance between using Ag and Cu as active electrodes. Furthermore, multilevel storage was achieved, and its outstanding performance as a memristor device has great potential in practical applications in neuromorphic computing (see the summarized performance comparison in Table 1).\n* This work."

After reaching a base vacuum of 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 Pa, high-purity oxygen (O2: 99.99%) was flowed into the chamber during the deposition. For STO thin film deposition, an oxygen partial pressure of 5 Pa was maintained, which is an important factor for the property control. After finishing the deposition of STO film, the sample was cooled down from 625 \u25e6C to room temperature in 1000 Pa oxygen pressure. Subsequently, the base vacuum of 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 Pa was resumed, and a 90 nm thick SnSe film was in situ deposited at room temperature on the STO film to form a SnSe/STO heterostructure. In order to compare the efficiencies of the different electrodes, Ag and Cu top electrodes were selected and deposited on the SnSe film by direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering at room temperature through a shadow mask from 80 to 500 \u00b5m in diameter. The thicknesses of the Ag and Cu top electrodes were about 80 and 180 nm, respectively.

The thicknesses of the electrode layers were measured by means of a surface profiler (DektakXT, Bruker, Breman, Germany). The microstructure of the heterostructure was characterized by means of transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEOL 2100F).\nAll of the first-principles calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP.5.4.4.18) with generalized gradient approximation of the Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof functional (GGA-PBE) and projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials [35\u201337].

We also repeated the switching process 1000 times on the Ag/SnSe/STO/Pt device to study the reliability. The results showed that after 500 times of switching, the on/off resistance ratio remained at about 10.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 2128 6 of 12\nTo analyze the switching mechanism, I\u2013V curves of the switching process of both the Cu and Ag devices were measured, and the results are shown in Figure 3c,d. It is apparent that the switching process of the Cu/SnSe/STO/Pt device can be divided into seven steps. However, the switching process of the Ag/SnSe/STO/Pt device is much more complicated and contains nine steps. According to reference reports, an important aspect of metal oxide materials is the migration of oxygen vacancies (or oxygen ions) under an applied electrical field [9\u201312,22,43,44]. Based on the investigations from former studies, the switching mechanism in our devices should be mediated by the forming and rupture of the conductive filament. This active medium is actually much smaller than the cell size, which allows for a potential of scaling. When the positive voltage sweep is applied on both the Cu and Ag-electrode devices, oxidation occurs on the Ag and Cu top electrode since both are electrochemically active metals. Therefore, volatile Cu+ and Ag+ cations could form as Cu\u2192 Cu2+ + 2e\u2212 and as Ag\u2192 Ag+ + e\u2212. These volatile cations migrate toward the Pt electrode through the SnSe layer and STO layer and are finally reduced by electrons flowing from the cathode (i.e., Cu2+ + 2e\u2212 \u2192 Cu and Ag+ + e\u2212 \u2192 Ag. Meanwhile, when negative voltage sweeps were applied, Cu ions and Ag ions can migrate back to the top electrode in the same way. However, because of the different electrochemical activities of Cu and Ag, the forming voltage of the Cu filament was relatively higher, and the switching time was relatively longer compared to the Ag filament formation [45,46]. The migration processes of the Cu filament and Ag filament in the SnSe layer and STO layer were different. In the Cu/SnSe/STO/Pt device, the 2nd step of the switching process showed that the Cu filament changed from the unstable state to stable state in the whole heterostructure. Before the Cu filament formed stably between the Cu top electrode and Pt bottom electrode, Cu ions first diffused into SnSe layer. After the Cu filament was stabilized in the SnSe layer between the Cu top electrode and the STO layer, it kept migrating to the Pt bottom electrode in the STO layer and finally changed the device to LRS. When the device was switched back from LRS to HRS in the 4th to 6th steps, the Cu filament ruptured and reduced back to the Cu top electrode. The filament first reduced in the STO layer and broke from the Pt bottom electrode, then it kept reducing in the STO layer, as shown in the 5th step. After the whole filament was reduced and broken in the STO layer, it started reducing at the SnSe layer and finally RESET to HRS, as shown in the 6th step. The switching process was very similar for the Ag/SnSe/STO/Pt device, but one could see that the 2nd to 4th steps, as shown in Figure 3d, presented a more complicated process when the Ag filament migrated between the SnSe layer and STO layer to switch the device to the ON state. Moreover, the RESET process of the Ag/SnSe/STO/Pt device in the 6th step showed a significant decrease in resistance, but the decreasing speed of resistance slowed down at the 7th step. This suggests that Ag ions migrate back from the STO layer to the SnSe layer and shows a multistate characteristic between the HRS and LRS. Finally, as the RESET voltage decreased, the Ag ions migrated back to the electrode and the device returned to the HRS. All of these switching processes show that these two devices may result in different resistance states, implying multilevel data storage and applications in neuromorphic computing. We also created double logarithmic plots of I\u2013V curves in both the positive voltage sweeps and negative voltage sweeps, as shown in Figure 4. One can see that during the SET process, as shown in Figure 4a,c, thermally generated carriers were dominant over the electrode-injected carriers in the ohmic conduction regime (I\u221dV) at low voltage. Then, the slope increased to the second regime (I\u221dV3) when the traps in SnSe/STO were all filled out by the carriers due to the further increase in the voltage. There were two distinctive regimes with different slopes in the SET process for both the Ag and Cu TE devices, which can be explained by the space charge limited conduction (SCLC) model. After the SET process, both devices were switched from HRS to LRS. As shown in Figure 4b,d, the double logarithmic plots of the I\u2013V curves in the RESET process of both the Ag and Cu TE devices were also well-fitted with a slope of about 1, suggesting an ohmic conduction behavior. This good fit indicates that Ag ion-based bridge filaments and Cu ion-based bridge filaments\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 2128 7 of 12\nare formed in the SnSe/STO heterostructure switching medium, where the current paths generated by filaments are metallic.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 12\nprocess, both devices were switched from HRS to LRS. As shown in Figure 4b,d, the double logarithmic plots of the I\u2013V curves in the RESET process of both the Ag and Cu TE devices were also well-fitted with a slope of about 1, suggesting an ohmic conduction behavior. This good fit indicates that Ag ion-based bridge filaments and Cu ion-based bridge filaments are formed in the SnSe/STO heterostructure switching medium, where the current paths generated by filaments are metallic.\nTo better understand the diffusion path and the energy barrier for Cu and Ag ions into the SnSe and STO layers, density-function theory (DFT) calculations were carried out. As shown in Figure 5a,b, SnSe provided a faster diffusion channel for both the Cu and Ag ions as the energy barriers were 0.46 eV for the Cu ions and 0.38 eV for the Ag ions, respectively, which were much lower compared to that in STO. The energy barrier for the Ag ion diffusion in STO layer was 1.21 eV, which is relatively higher than that of the energy barrier for Cu ion, which was 0.99 eV, as shown in Figure 5c,d. This result supports the fact that Ag, as the top electrode, can archive more resistance states in the SnSe/STO heterostructure because the relatively higher energy barrier in STO helps to stabilize the intermediate states by delaying the filament rapture process. Since the LRS of devices is the initial state to achieve multistate and the time it takes for a voltage pulse to reach the middle state is approximately 1\u20135 \u00b5s [23], the filament in the SnSe layer and STO layer cannot migrate back to the top electrode completely in such a short time [22,47\u201350].

Therefore, this delayed process increases the possibility of forming more resistance states when negative voltage pluses are applied on the device to rupture the filament [13].

It was found that the resistance states of memory cells with a Cu top electrode and Ag top electrode could achieve six and eight resistance states, respectively, and the formation and destruction of Cu and Ag filaments in the SnSe and STO layers under voltage sweeping and voltage pulses are believed to be responsible for these characteristics. These multilevel states were reliable during 103 SET and RESET reliability tests and were stable after 104 s retention tests. These results suggest that the SnSe/STO heterostructure-based memristors may have a great potential for synaptic devices.\nAuthor Contributions: Thin film and electrical measurement, T.-L.H.; modeling, K.D. and M.Y.; electrical measurement, N.L.; electrode deposition, C.-H.S.; TEM characterization, L.-W.W. and J.Z.; target materials X.Z.; conceptualization, J.-Y.D.
