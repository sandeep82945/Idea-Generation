    "abstractText": "Glioblastoma (GBM) contains cancer stem cells (CSC) that are resistant to treatment. GBM CSC expresses glycolipids recognized by the A2B5 antibody. A2B5, induced by the enzyme ST8 alphaN-acetyl-neuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyl transferase 3 (ST8Sia3), plays a crucial role in the proliferation, migration, clonogenicity and tumorigenesis of GBM CSC. Our aim was to characterize the resulting effects of neuraminidase that removes A2B5 in order to target GBM CSC. To this end, we set up a GBM organotypic slice model; quantified A2B5 expression by flow cytometry in U87-MG, U87-ST8Sia3 and GBM CSC lines, treated or not by neuraminidase; performed RNAseq and DNA methylation profiling; and analyzed the ganglioside expression by liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry in these cell lines, treated or not with neuraminidase. Results demonstrated that neuraminidase decreased A2B5 expression, tumor size and regrowth after surgical removal in the organotypic slice model but did not induce a distinct transcriptomic or epigenetic signature in GBM CSC lines. RNAseq analysis revealed that OLIG2, CHI3L1, TIMP3, TNFAIP2, and TNFAIP6 transcripts were significantly overexpressed in U87-ST8Sia3 compared to U87-MG. RT-qPCR confirmed these results and demonstrated that neuraminidase decreased gene expression in GBM CSC lines. Moreover, neuraminidase drastically reduced ganglioside expression in GBM CSC lines. Neuraminidase, by its pleiotropic action, is an attractive local treatment against GBM.",

            "text": "Glioblastoma (GBM), IDH wildtype, is the most common malignant primary tumor of the central nervous system [1]. Its prognosis remains dismal after the standard of care, which relies on surgery followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy [2]. The median overall survival is around 15 months with no significant improvement in spite of a plethora of clinical trials [3]. There is therefore an urgent need for new therapeutic approaches targeting relevant targets. Three main factors are responsible for the resistance to treatment: the blood\u2013brain barrier, the tumor-propagating microenvironment, and the occurrence of tumor-initiating cells or cancer stem cells (CSC), which are resistant to cell death and drive relapse. Several cell surface markers have been reported in GBM CSC, including, among others, CD133 and A2B5 [4\u20139]. The A2B5 monoclonal antibody, originally prepared against chicken\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 11645. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241411645 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 11645 2 of 22\nembryo retina cells [10], reacts with gangliosides that contain a trisialo sequence (i.e., GT3 and alkali-labile O-acetyl GT3, GQ1c and GP1c) [11\u201313]. Gangliosides are glycosphingolipids composed of a ceramide lipid tail attached through glycosidic linkage to a glycan headgroup containing one or more sialic acid residues. According to the Svennerholm classification, gangliosides can be classified in four series (0-, a-, b-, and c-series) based on the number of sialic acid residues (from 0 to 3) linked to the inner galactose residue [14], the A2B5 antibody recognizing gangliosides of the c-series (for review [15]). Ganglioside biosynthesis involves sequential activities of distinct glycosyltransferases and sialyltransferases. The ST8Sia family is known to catalyze the production of \u03b12,8-linked sialic acid chains according to the acceptor specificity of glycoproteins and gangliosides [16]. ST8Sia3 has been proposed to deliver \u03b12,8-triSia and polySia units onto glycoproteins in vitro [17], and we have shown that ST8Sia3 strongly increased A2B5 expression at the cell surface of U87-MG and U251-MG cell lines [18]. In human GBM, A2B5 and CD133 expression distinguishes three cell populations: A2B5\u2212/CD133\u2212, A2B5+/CD133+, and A2B5+/CD133\u2212. Although the A2B5\u2212 cell population is not able to generate tumors when they are injected into the brains of nude rats or mice, the two other populations generate tumors [7,8]. By using MACS to isolate and characterize A2B5+ and A2B5\u2212 fractions from fresh human GBM, we showed that A2B5+ but not A2B5\u2212 cells have cancer stem cell properties: they can form spheroids, are selfrenewing, and are able to differentiate towards the neural, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes when placed in differentiating media [8]. Furthermore, we and others have generated GBM CSC lines by isolating A2B5+ cells from fresh human samples [8,9,19,20]. Importantly, the number of A2B5+ cells is maintained through serial passages and is recorded in almost all cells after the third passage [9]. In order to decipher the functional role of the A2B5 epitope in human GBM, we used various cell models that express high or low A2B5 levels. To this end, the ST8Sia3 gene was stably overexpressed by lentiviral infection or silenced by using shRNA technology in two GBM cell lines expressing mild (U251-MG, 50.25% \u00b1 3.06) and low (U87-MG, 17.5% \u00b1 0.96) levels of A2B5 immunoreactivity. ST8Sia3 mRNA was significantly increased in ST8Sia3-overexpressing cells in comparison to the wild-type cell lines and the shST8sia3 cell lines. When grafted orthotopically in mice, extended survival was observed with sh-ST8sia3 cell lines in comparison with the ST8Sia3 cell lines. Since the lentiviral delivery of shST8Sia3 in two CSC lines (GBM6 and GBM9) expressing a high level of A2B5 stopped their growth, we used neuraminidase administration to remove the A2B5 epitope at the cell surface of CSC lines and observed impaired cell survival, proliferation and self-renewal [18]. The aim of the present study was to better understand the effect of neuraminidase administration at the cellular level to tackle human GBM CSC. To achieve this goal, first, we quantified A2B5 expression at the cell surface of our cell models before and after neuraminidase administration; second, we used an organotypic three-dimensional model to further characterize the action of neuraminidase; third, we searched for a transcriptomic and epigenetic signature induced by neuraminidase administration as well as changes in ganglioside expression."

In addition, NESTIN and PROM-1, two precursor cell markers, were investigated. The results are reported in Figure 5. In all cases, neuraminidase administration induces significant downregulation of OLIG2 expression (p < 0.001) (Figure 5a), CHI3L1 (p < 0.001) (Figure 5b), TIMP3 (p < 0.001) (Figure 5c), TNFAIP2 expression (p < 0.01) (Figure 5d), and with a tendency for TNFAIP6 expression (p = 0.054) (Figure 5e).

By immunofluorescence, we confirmed the strong reduction in OLIG2 protein expression in each CSC line after neuraminidase administration in comparison to control (Figure 5f). To go further, we took advantage of the organotypic slice model to analyze neuraminidase effects on tumor growth (U87-ST8Sia3 and GBM6 cell lines) within its cerebral microenvironment. The RNA extraction yield from biopsy punch tumor samples did not allow us to perform the analysis of the five genes of interest; we analyzed OLIG2 and CHI3L1.

First, precursor ion scanning of the characteristic fragment of gangliosides, N-Acetylneuraminic acid, at m/z 290, was performed in the negative mode. Gangliosides corresponding to commercial standards were detected in cell lines, confirming their identification: GM3, GM2, GM1, GD2, GD3, GD1a, GD1b, GT1b and GQ1b. Only GM1 co-eluted with GD3, which could, however, be distinguished thanks to MS. A few additional minor peaks could also be detected in addition to major ganglioside classes. They did not correspond to commercial standards and required high-resolution mass spectrometry to be characterized. Unfortunately, it was not possible to perform this additional technique because of an insufficient amount of material. The proportions of the different molecular species detected, corresponding to different ceramide structures, were calculated for each ganglioside class independently, using the data obtained with the QqQ mass spectrometer operated in the negative SRM mode [21,22].

            "text": "Our previous results supported the view that the A2B5 epitope plays a crucial functional role in the promotion of proliferation, migration, clonogenicity and tumorigenesis of GBM CSC. Moreover, the lentiviral delivery of shST8Sia3 in two CSC lines (GBM6 and GBM9) expressing a high level of A2B5 stopped their growth, highlighting that the A2B5 epitope sustained GBM CSC viability [18]. Therefore, neuraminidase that strongly decreases A2B5 expression at the CSC surface might be an attractive therapeutic target for human GBM but requires a better understanding of its action at the cellular level before using it to target human GBM. With this aim, we first confirmed that neuraminidase administration in the GBM organotypic slice model strongly decreased A2B5 expression and the size of the tumors generated after spheroid implantation. However, it is clear that it does not lead to regression of the tumor but rather to stabilization. This might be explained by the persistence of some A2B5-expressing cells after neuraminidase administration and/or the reappearance of A2B5 expression at the cell surface of some tumor cells. It is well known, however, that numerous drugs, especially temozolomide, display a transient efficacy in GBM, leading to tumor resistance and treatment failure (reviewed in [23]), and that this resistance might be secondary to the presence of GBM CSC [24]. Of interest, a previous report showed that adjuvant immunotherapy targeting O-acetyl GD2 ganglioside impaired temozolomide resistance driven by glioma-stem-like cells [25]. Then, we searched for a genetic signature induced by neuraminidase administration in the three A2B5 high CSC lines previously produced in our laboratory. We failed to identify such a genetic signature, and we learnt from the RNAseq performed that each cell line had its own transcriptomic signature and that this signature did not really change after neuraminidase administration, likely because the broad differences between the transcriptome and epigenetic signature of each CSC cell line (GBM6, GBM9 and GBM40) hide those induced by 24 h neuraminidase administration. We also observed that neuraminidase administration did not induce a specific epigenetic signature. Again, DNA methylation profiling showed that each cell line displayed a similar DNA methylation profile to its neuraminidase counterpart. DNA methylation study also showed that the methylation profile of the U87-MG cell line and its derivatives were strikingly different from that observed in CSC lines. Moreover, the DKFZ human brain tumor classifier [26] was unable to provide a DNA methylation class (MC) for the U87-MG cell line, in contrast to the CSC lines that had an MC of GBM, IDH-wildtype. This result is in keeping with recent studies that have challenged the origin of the U87-MG cell line [27]. It is likely, however, that this cell line, which was set up many years ago [28], might have been derived. Nevertheless, the U87-MG cell line, which is widely used, remains an attractive model, easy to manipulate for screening the role of some selected genes. Therefore, we used it to generate the U87-ST8Sia3 cell line in which the ST8Sia3 gene was stably overexpressed by lentiviral infection. We observed that the percentage of cells expressing A2B5 was high in U87-ST8Sia3 (80.2% \u00b1 3.6), in comparison to the U87-MG (14.6% \u00b1 6.9) or to the U87ST8Sia3 cell line treated with neuraminidase (17.3 \u00b1 7.8). By comparing the transcriptomic signature of the U87-ST8Sia3 cell line to that of U87-MG, we identified 63 genes significantly\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 11645 13 of 22\noverexpressed in the U87-ST8Sia3 cell line. Among them, we selected five genes previously reported to be relevant in GBM: OLIG2, CHI3L1, TIMP3, TNFAIP2 and TNFAIP6. We first confirmed by RT-qPCR that all these genes except one (CHI3L1) were overexpressed in the U87-ST8Sia3 cell line in comparison to U87-MG (p < 0.001 for OLIG2, TIMP3 and TNFAIP2 and p < 0.05 for TNFAIP6). Of the utmost interest, we further confirmed in the GBM CSC that neuraminidase administration drastically reduced the expression of the five selected genes (p < 0.001 for OLIG2, CHI3L1 and TIMP3; p < 0.01 for TNFAIP2 and p = 0.054 for TNFAIP6). Moreover, we further showed a strong reduction in OLIG2 protein expression by immunofluorescence in the three CSC lines after neuraminidase administration. All these genes play a crucial role in stemness (OLIG2), invasion (CHI3L1, TIMP3, TNFAIP2) and proliferation (TNFAIP2 and TNFAIP6), three major functions that were found to be sustained by A2B5 epitope expression [18]. OLIG2 transcription factor is implicated in neurogenesis and gliogenesis [29] and is described as a key gene in gliomagenesis. Although the requirement of OLIG2 in maintaining the growth of GBM cells is unknown, Ligon et al. suggested that it was essential in establishing xenografts [30], and Rich et al. reported that OLIG2 expression was restricted to CSCs and was probably a proliferation regulator [31]. In another model, Bao et al. showed that targeting L1CAM expression in CSCs impaired cell growth and sphere formation and was associated with a decrease in OLIG2 expression and apoptosis induction [6]. More recently, it was reported that OLIG2 modulates growth factor signaling in two distinct populations of glioma stem-like cells depending on their EGFR or PDGFR\u03b1 expression [32]. Of interest, in our study, the OLIG2 gene was the only one that remained significant when each GBM CSC line was studied separately. Since these three cell lines exhibit a distinct transcriptomic profile, as previously reported for GBM6 and GBM9 [19], and epigenetic profile (present study), this result emphasizes that the strong decrease in OLIG2 gene expression both at the transcriptome level but also at the protein level after neuraminidase administration might affect all GBM subtypes. TNFAIP2 is a primary response gene of TNF\u03b1, and high expression is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, invasion and metastasis in various cancers including breast and esophagus cancers and gliomas [33\u201335]. Interestingly, it has been shown that in myeloma cells, TNFAIP2 was significantly induced by cell adhesion to fibronectin [36], an extracellular matrix protein that is strongly overexpressed in GBM [37,38]. TNFAIP6 was recently reported as a Hub gene associated with the progression of GBM by weighted gene co-expression network analysis [39]. Of interest also, TNFAIP6 was identified among ARL4C and MSN as a neural progenitor cell-associated chemoradiotherapy resistance gene set for the prognosis of glioma [40]. Moreover, TNFAIP6 also promotes invasion in various other cancers [41,42]. CHI3L1 is overexpressed in many human cancers including GBM (reviewed in [43]). CHI3L1 stimulates cell growth and proliferation in fibroblasts through the phosphorylation of MAPK and AKT signaling [44]. In GBM, CHI3L1 regulates tumorigenesis by interrupting the pathways leading to apoptosis and by remodeling the extra-cellular matrix to create a good substrate for tumor growth [45]. It has also been recently reported that it promotes glioma progression via the NFKB signaling pathway and tumor microenvironment reprogramming [46]. TIMP3 belongs to the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (MMPs) that regulate the pericellular proteolysis of a vast range of matrix and cell surface proteins, generating simultaneous effects on the tumor architecture and cell signaling. TIMPs (1 to 4) are present in the extracellular matrix (ECM) in a soluble form, except for TIMP3, which is bound to ECM. All TIMPs inhibit MMP through reversible blockage, forming 1:1 stoichiometric complexes [47]. Among the members of the family, TIMP3 silencing is usually associated with cancer progression or poor patient prognosis [47], but some studies also reported poor prognosis associated with high TIMP3 expression [48]. Here, we found that TIMP3 expression was reduced after neuraminidase administration and therefore might impair its function. Importantly, TIMP3 binds to MMP2 and MMP9 (reviewed in [49]), and we\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 11645 14 of 22\nhave previously reported that GBM MMP2 is expressed by tumor cells whereas MMP9 is expressed by tumor-infiltrative neutrophils. Moreover, in the AVAglio study [50], showed that the baseline plasma MMP9 level was predictive of bevacizumab efficacy in newly diagnosed GBM [51]. Whether a high TIMP3 level changes its binding to the ECM and/or induces disequilibrium between the MMP2 and MMP9 level in GBM, leading to adverse effects, remains unknown. However, it is obvious that the regulation of the TIMPS family in cancer remains complex, leading to functional disparities depending on the model used [52]. Furthermore, we learnt from this study that the pattern of ganglioside expression revealed by liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectroscopy was strikingly different in the U87-MG cell line versus the CSC line. The U87-MG cell line was characterized by a high expression of GM3 ganglioside, as previously reported [53]. Importantly, ST8Sia3 overexpression in the U87-MG cell line induced a switch from the GM3 ganglioside towards other gangliosides of the a-series (GM2, GM1) and to b-series gangliosides (GD3, GD2 and GD1b). Unfortunately, this technique was not fully appropriate for the detection of c-series gangliosides (which are the main A2B5 carriers), but because of the switch towards b-series induced by ST8Sia3, it is likely that some c-series gangliosides might be included in the \u2018non-identified\u2019 ganglioside compound observed in the U87-ST8Sia3 cell line. In contrast to what was observed in the U87-MG cell line, GBM6 and GBM9 CSC lines displayed a similar ganglioside profile characterized by the overexpression of GM2 and b-series gangliosides, a pattern reminiscent of that described in the U87-ST8Sia3 cell line. Of importance, we observed that neuraminidase administration in both CSC lines drastically reduced ganglioside expression at their cell surface, except for GM2. This might be explained by the action of neuraminidase, which preferentially hydrolyses \u03b12-3 and \u03b12-8 terminal sialyl linkages but is ineffective on the \u03b12-3 inner sialic acid branch (characterizing GM1 and GM2) in accordance with the fact that GM2 was not affected by the enzyme [54,55]. These overall changes after neuraminidase administration were less obvious in the U87-ST8Sia3 cell line, likely because of the constitutive synthesis of b-series gangliosides induced by ST8Sia3. Several studies have reported that GD2 and GD3 are highly expressed in GBM as well as several glycosyl transferases involved in their biosynthesis [56\u201358]. Moreover, GD3 synthase appeared as a key driver for GBM cancer stem cell maintenance and tumorigenesis [57]. Therefore, neuraminidase, which strongly affects sialic acid expression carried by complex gangliosides, induces major changes in cell surface glycosylation of CSC lines and consequently affects cell\u2013cell and cell matrix interaction, with a major impact on downstream processes [59]. Moreover, the sialylation status is exploited by tumors to evade both innate and adaptative immune destruction. Cell surface sialylation is recognized by complement factor H, and sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) acts as a major checkpoint for immune response in the central nervous system (reviewed in [60]). Moreover, it has also been shown that sialic acid blockade suppresses tumor growth by enhancing T-cell-mediated tumor immunity [61]. Therefore, neuraminidase that strongly affects cell surface ganglioside by inducing less sialylated ones might be also considered as a strategy for GBM immunotherapy."

Raw signal intensities were obtained from .idat files using the minfi Bioconductor package (v1.34.0). Background correction and dye-bias correction were performed on each sample. Filtering criteria of probes were the removal of probes targeting X or Y chromosomes and the removal of probes containing single-nucleotide polymorphisms.

The first one, ProfileXpert (Lyon, France), was instrumental for RNA-seq from GBM6, GBM9 and GBM40 CSC lines (treated or not with neuraminidase), whereas in the second one, GBiM platform (Marseille, France), RNA-seq from U87-MG, and U87-ST8Sia3 was performed. Briefly, the total RNA was isolated and qualified, and polyA+ mRNA purification was performed using Qiamp (Qiagen SAS, Courtaboeuf, France), Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Les Ulis, France) and polyT oligo-attached magnetic beads. After two rounds of enrichment for PolyA+ mRNA and thermal fragmentation,\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 11645 17 of 22\ncDNA was synthesized using superscript II and random primers, followed by secondstrand cDNA synthesis, end repair process, adenylation of 3\u2019 ends and ligation of the adapters. The products were then purified and enriched with 15 cycles of PCR to create the cDNA library. Libraries were quantified by qPCR using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit for Illumina Libraries (Roche Applied Science, Meylan, France), and profiles were assessed using the DNA High Sensitivity LabChip Kit (Agilent Technologies, Les Ulis, France) on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Les Ulis, France). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 using a cartridge of the NextSeq 500/550 High Output v2 kit (150 cycles) (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).\n4.5.2. Differential Gene Expression Analyses\nThe raw sequencing data were first converted into FastQ files, which contain 75 nt single-end reads. This conversion was performed using Illumina bcl2fastq software version 2.17.1.14 by allowing for one mismatch in the barcodes when demultiplexing the reads. The quality of the reads was then assessed using FastQC version 0.11 [65]. In order to ensure high-quality data, any low-quality bases and adapters were removed from the reads using Cutadapt version 1.9.1 [66]. The quality threshold score used for this process was set to 30, and the minimum length of the reads was set to 50 nt after trimming. Next, the reads were pseudo-aligned to the GRCh38 transcriptome using kallisto version 0.44.0 [67]. This step enabled the quantification of the transcript abundances within the samples. Counts were then normalized and analyzed for differential gene expression using DESeq2 version 1.26.0 [68]. Differentially expressed genes were identified as those with a fold change of log2 (fc) \u2265 log2 (1.5) and a p-value < 0.05, with p-values being adjusted using the Benjamini and Hochberg method. Genes that were identified as differentially expressed were classified as being up-regulated or down-regulated based on the fold-change values. In order to obtain a short list of relevant genes from the data generated by the GBiM platform (Marseille, France), we differentially selected genes that showed a fold change strictly higher than 3 and p value strictly lower than 10\u22125; http://www.genecards.org and http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html were used for gene analysis."

Moreover, neuraminidase administration also induces major changes in cell surface ganglioside expression and therefore sialylation that might influence the interactions between GBM tumor cells and the microenvironment. Although very promising, numerous experiments must be carried out before including neuraminidase in the GBM therapeutic arsenal, especially as local treatment, likely in combination with other drugs. These include, among others, the measurement of the long-term action of neuraminidase, stabilization of the enzyme, and combination with other drugs such as temozolomide. In addition, given the role of sialic acids in both innate and adaptative immune responses, dedicated experiments must be carried out to analyze the role of neuraminidase in these processes.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms241411645/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, N.B.-K., R.B. and D.F.-B.; methodology, N.B.-K., R.B., V.H., S.C., J.G. and A.G.; software, R.B., S.C., J.G. and C.C.; resources, D.F.-B.; data curation, N.B.-K., R.B., C.C. and D.F.-B.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, N.B.-K., R.B., S.C., C.C. and D.F.-B.; writing\u2014review and editing, N.B.-K., R.B., E.T., A.T., C.C. and D.F.-B.; supervision, D.F.-B.; funding acquisition, E.T., A.T. and D.F.-B.
