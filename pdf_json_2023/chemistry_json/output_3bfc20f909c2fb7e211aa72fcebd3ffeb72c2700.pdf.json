    "abstractText": "Although the supramolecular structure of porphyrin polymers on flat surfaces (i.e., mica and HOPG) has been extensively studied, the self-assembly arrays of porphyrin polymers on the SWNT (as curved nanocarbon surfaces) have yet to be fully identified and/or investigated, especially using microscopic imaging techniques, i.e., scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This study reports the identification of the supramolecular structure of poly-[5,15-bis-(3,5-isopentoxyphenyl)-10,20-bis ethynylporphyrinato]zinc (II) on the SWNT surface using mainly AFM and HR-TEM microscopic imaging techniques. After synthesizing around >900 mer of porphyrin polymer (via Glaser-Hay coupling); the as-prepared porphyrin polymer is then non-covalently adsorbed on SWNT surface. Afterward, the resultant porphyrin/SWNT nanocomposite is then anchored with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), which are used as a marker, via coordination bonding to produce a porphyrin polymer/AuNPs/SWNT hybrid. The polymer, AuNPs, nanocomposite, and/or nanohybrid are characterized using 1H-NMR, mass spectrometry, UV-visible spectroscopy, AFM, as well as HR-TEM measuring techniques. The selfassembly arrays of porphyrin polymers moieties (marked with AuNPs) prefer to form a coplanar well-ordered, regular, repeated array (rather than wrapping) between neighboring molecules along the polymer chain on the tube surface. This will help with further understanding, designing, and fabricating novel supramolecular architectonics of porphyrin/SWNT-based devices.",

            "text": "Porphyrin is derived from the ancient Greek word \u201cPorphura,\u201d which describes the color purple. Porphyrins are a broad group of intensely colored organic dyes that can be found in nature or made synthetically [1,2]. Porphyrins play a crucial role in biochemical processes in vivo as well as metabolism, where they are naturally present in two well-known vital biochemical molecules, i.e., hemoglobin (iron II porphyrin) and chlorophyll (magnesium II porphyrin). Therefore, life would be impossible without porphyrins and their metal derivatives. Consequently, understanding these porphyrin systems can aid our understanding of a variety of essential biological processes, including oxygen binding in hemoglobin, biological catalysis, and the light absorption step in the photosynthesis process. Porphyrins and their derivatives may be synthesized with various functional groups, including anchoring groups that can be directly linked to metal electrodes. Porphyrins are architecturally adaptable, and there are different chemical methods that may be used to combine various building blocks, including aldehydes, pyrroles, dipyrromethanes, dipyrromethenes, and linear tetrapyrroles, which can be utilized in the synthesis schemes.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1439. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15061439 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1439 2 of 13\nIn addition to being exceedingly stable in solution and at high temperatures, porphyrins may be dissolved in both organic and aqueous solvents [3]. Porphyrins, related compounds, and other polymers become significant candidates in many potential applications (i.e., electronic devices, physics, and many materials science applications) [4\u201314] as they have remarkable physical and chemical features, in addition, they can be simply synthesized with a wide substituent range. Likewise, carbon nanotubes (especially single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs)) have attracted much more attention in nanoscience and nanotechnology due to their unusual properties compared to other materials and high applicability [15]. Accordingly, SWNTs can be involved in many applications, i.e., molecular and nano-electronics [16\u201318], sensing [19\u201322], medicine [23,24], and as catalysts [25,26]. Based on their size and shape, nanoparticles have distinct physical, chemical, optical, and catalytic properties [27,28]. The integration of SWNT, porphyrins, and nanoparticles will lead to a crucial improvement in the composite characteristics and/or properties [12,29\u201332]. Our group has made a lot of efforts to explore the supramolecular structures of porphyrin polymers on flat surfaces (i.e., mica and HOPG) [33\u201336], but still the self-assembly arrays of porphyrin polymers on the SWNT (as curved nanocarbon surfaces) have not yet been fully identified and/or investigated (although there have been some attempts from our group and others [37\u201340]) especially using microscopic imaging techniques, i.e., scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In our previous study [31] we successfully reported that porphyrin monomer can be self-assembled on the SWNT surface, forming a regular pattern wrapping around the SWNT. Consequently, we could successfully identify (for the first time) the absolute handedness chirality of SWNT via the supramolecular structure of porphyrin monomer using STM imaging technique under ambient conditions. We have tried to identify the supramolecular structures of porphyrin polymers on SWNT surface using STM imaging technique as we did it using porphyrin monomer [10,31], but unfortunately, we could not as the polymer probably may form a complicated 2D structure which cannot be possibly identified using STM especially under ambient conditions. Herein, we have succeeded in identifying the supramolecular structure of poly[5,15-bis-(3,5-isopentoxyphenyl)-10,20-bis-ethynylporphyrinato]-zinc (II) on the SWNT surface using mainly AFM and HR-TEM microscopic imaging techniques. Firstly, around ~ >900 mer porphyrins were non-covalently adsorbed on SWNT surface via \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking as well as van der Waal interactions. Afterward, the resultant porphyrin/SWNT nanocomposite was then anchored with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), which were used as a marker, via coordination bonding to produce a porphyrin polymer/AuNPs/SWNT hybrid. The self-assembly arrays of porphyrin polymers (marked with AuNPs) were then distinguished mainly using AFM and HR-TEM microscopic imaging techniques, where the porphyrin moieties prefer to form a coplanar well-ordered regular repeated array (rather than wrapping) between neighboring molecules along the polymer chain on the tube surface."

The images demonstrate an obvious SWNT debundling effect owing to the adsorption of porphyrin polymer on the SWNT surface, which is an indication for the successful functionalization of SWNT with the polymer molecules, which agrees with the UV-visible measurements (Figure 4). Nevertheless, there are some SWNT parts that are not totally functionalized with the polymer molecules, as marked by the green arrows in the images (d\u2013h), which refer to bare SWNT.

For more confirmation, we have tried to identify the supramolecular structures of porphyrin polymers on SWNT surface using STM imaging technique as we did it using porphyrin monomer [10,31], but unfortunately, we could not as the polymer probably may form a complicated 2D structure which cannot be possibly identified using STM especially under ambient conditions. Therefore, it was worthy to use gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as markers after anchoring with porphyrin molecules via coordination bonding to produce a porphyrin polymer/AuNPs/SWNT hybrid that can be possibly identified using HR-TEM as well as AFM with clearer images, which will be discussed in detail in the following section."

            "text": "Firstly, we synthesized the protected gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in the form of t-dodecanethiol-pyridineethanethiol-AuNPs by using the ligand-exchange method [36] (modified from the original method [41]), in which an exchange was conducted between t-dodecanethiolAuNPs and 4-pyridineethanethiol in toluene, as illustrated in Scheme S1. The synthesized AuNPs were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy as well as HRTEM. The UV-visible (Figure S11a) shows the characteristic plasmon peak of AuNP at 521 nm, which agrees with the reported results [42]. However, the average diameter of the synthesized AuNPs determined from the TEM measurement (Figure S11b) is about 2.6 \u00b1 0.2 nm, which agrees with our reported results [36]. The porphyrin polymer/AuNPs/SWNT nanohybrid was then prepared by sonicating the polymer/SWNT nanocomposite with a methanolic solution of AuNPs for half an hour, followed by centrifugation, filtration, washed with MeOH (100 mL), dried under N2 gas, and finally kept for the microscopic measurements (as presented in Figure S3). The porphyrin/SWNT nanocomposite was anchored with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), which were used as markers, via coordination bonding to produce the porphyrin polymer/AuNPs/SWNT nanohybrid. Figure 6 displays the typical AFM images (a, b, c, g) (topographic) and (d, e, f, h) (phase) of porphyrin polymer/AuNPs/SWNT nanohybrid on mica surface collected under ambient conditions. The images demonstrate a clear SWNT debundling effect, which agrees with the UV-visible measurements (Figure 4) as well as AFM measurements of polymer/SWNT nanocomposite (Figure 5). Using AuNPs as a marker is a convenient way to construct the ordered molecular assemblies on the SWNT surface, where we can clearly see the AuNPs are aligned along the SWNTs. Moreover, the images also display obvious self-assembly arrays of porphyrin polymers (marked with AuNPs) on the tube surface. Although porphyrin polymer molecules form a well-ordered regular pattern, it is not fully clear (from AFM images) to judge whether it is a coplanar well-ordered regular repeated array between neighboring molecules (Figure 7a) or the polymer molecules are wrapping along the tube surface, forming a helical structure (Figure 7b). As mentioned previously, we have tried to identify the supramolecular structures of porphyrin polymers on SWNT surfaces using STM imaging techniques, but unfortunately, we could not. Therefore, we decided to use HR-TEM measurements instead. Figure 8 depicts the typical HR-TEM images of porphyrin polymer molecules (marked with AuNPs) on a SWNT surface. It is obviously shown from the images that the porphyrin polymer molecules self-assemble in the form of a coplanar, well-ordered, regular, repeated arrays (Figure 7a) rather than wrapping along the tube surface. The self-assembly process restricts the porphyrin rotation about the butadiyne links, which increases the coplanarity between neighboring porphyrins along the polymer chain. Additionally, the nanotube acts as a template that restricts torsional disorder within the polymer backbone and induces a coplanar arrangement of porphyrin repeated units, which totally agrees with the previous assumption [40]. It was previously assumed that the polymer molecules could align in the form of a coplanar, well-ordered, regular, repeated array on the tube surface, but unfortu-\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1439 9 of 13\nnately, with no clear experimental evidence [40], in this study, we succeeded in presenting some experimental proofs for that finding, i.e., HR-TEM as well as AFM measurements.\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 15\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1439 10 of 13Polymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 15\nFigure 8.
