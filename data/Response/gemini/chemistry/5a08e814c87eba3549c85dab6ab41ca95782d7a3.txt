1. **Investigate the long-term effects of XHP on ALD.** The current study only examined the short-term effects of XHP on ALD in mice. It would be valuable to conduct a long-term study to assess the safety and efficacy of XHP in preventing or treating ALD in humans.
2. **Identify the specific mechanisms by which XHP exerts its hepatoprotective effects.** The current study identified several potential targets of XHP, but it did not investigate the specific mechanisms by which XHP exerts its hepatoprotective effects. Future studies should focus on elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms of XHP's action.
3. **Develop a standardized XHP formulation for clinical use.** The current study used a specific formulation of XHP that was prepared in-house. It would be necessary to develop a standardized XHP formulation for clinical use, ensuring that the product is consistent and reproducible.
4. **Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XHP in humans with ALD.** The current study provides promising preclinical evidence for the use of XHP in the treatment of ALD. However, it is necessary to conduct clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XHP in humans with ALD.
5. **Explore the potential use of XHP in the prevention of ALD.** The current study focused on the treatment of ALD. However, it would be valuable to explore the potential use of XHP in the prevention of ALD. Future studies should investigate whether XHP can prevent or delay the onset of ALD in individuals at risk for the disease.
