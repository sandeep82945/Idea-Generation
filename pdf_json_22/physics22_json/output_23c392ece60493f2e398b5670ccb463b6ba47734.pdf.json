Based on our calculations, the new X (6900) state observed by LHCb may be not a ground ccc\u0304c\u0304 tetraquark state, while it could be an orbitally or radially excited state of ccc\u0304c\u0304 system.

            "text": "Structure and properties of the XY Z states, those are beyond the traditional qq\u0304 constituent quark picture, have been intensively studied in the last two decades [1\u20136], since the discovery of the famous X (3872) [7] in the exclusive B\u00b1 \u2192 K\u00b1\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 J/\u03c8 decays. Theoretically, the observed XY Z states are often described as compact tetraquark states, hadronic molecular states, or admixtures of these two kinds of states. Alternatively, one can also treat some of the exotic candidates to be admixtures of the qq\u0304 and (qq\u0304)2 components. In any case, systematical investigations on the meson exotic states can of course deepen our understanding on the non-perturbative regime of QCD theory.\na e-mail: gli@qfnu.edu.cn (corresponding author) b e-mail: ancs@swu.edu.cn (corresponding author)\nAmong the meson exotic states, tremendous investigations on the fully-heavy tetraquark states have been taken very recently, inspired by the experimental measurement carried by LHCb that a broad structure in the range 6.2\u20136.8 GeV and a narrow structure at \u223c 6.9 GeV are observed in the di-J/\u03c8 invariant spectrum [8], which indicates the existence of the all-charm tetraquark states. In fact, theoretical investigations on the fully-heavy tetraquark states could be traced back to 1980s [9\u201313], while these works have not gotten enough attentions because of lack of experimental data. In the new century, discovery of more and more meson exotic states attracted attentions of hadronic physicists again on the fully-heavy tetraquark states, lots of theoretical predictions on spectrum of the QQQ\u0304Q\u0304 (Q = c, b) tetraquark states have been done before 2020 [14\u201328]. Since the discovery of X (6900) in 2020 [8], tremendous theoretical investigations on the structure, production and decay of all-heavy tetraquark states have been taken using different approaches such as the constituent quark model, diquark-diquark picture, QCD sum rules, effective field theory, etc. [29\u201357]. Both the compact and hadronic molecular structure have been considered in these theoretical investigations, and most of the results suggest that the experimentally observed X (6900) may be not a ground state of the tetraquark/molecular state. In addition to the LHCb experiments [8], the CMS [58] and ATLAS [59] collaborations have reported their measurements on the fullycharm structure at the very recent ICHEP 2022 conference. And three all-charm structures are reported, whose BreitWigner masses are [58]:\nMX (6600) = 6552 \u00b1 10 \u00b1 12 MeV, MX (6900) = 6927 \u00b1 9 \u00b1 5 MeV, MX (7300) = 7287 \u00b1 19 \u00b1 5 MeV.\nBesides the all-charm tetraquark states, experimental efforts on searching the beauty-full tetraquark states bbb\u0304b\u0304 have also been made by years. The CMS collaboration have suggested a possible energy region for searching the bbb\u0304b\u0304 structure in the proton\u2013proton collision recently [60], but there is no confirmed signature found by later measurements carried by LHCb and CMS collaborations [61,62].\nAccordingly, it\u2019s still worthy for us to study the fullyheavy tetraquark states systematically. As we know, the constituent quark model is one of the most powerful approach to investigate on spectrum of the multi-quark states. In a very recent work [63], the constituent quark model with an instanton-induced effective interaction has been developed to study the spectrum of S-wave hidden and double charm tetraquark states, and some interesting results consistent with the experimental data and other theoretical investigations have been obtained. Along this line, in present work, we study the mass spectra of the S-wave fully-heavy tetraquark states QQQ\u0304Q\u0304 using the quark model as shown in Ref. [63]. In addition, here we also employ the widely used one-gluon-exchange model to estimate energies of the fullyheavy tetraquark states, and discuss the numerical results obtained with the two different approaches.\nThe present manuscript is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we show the theoretical formalism of this work, including effective Hamiltonian and explicit wave functions of the studied fully-heavy tetraquark states. Determinations of all the model parameters and the corresponding numerical results for spectrum of fully-heavy tetraquark states in the presently employed instanton-induced and one-gluon-exchange models are presented in Sect. 3. Finally, Sect. 4 is a brief summary of the present work.\n2 Framework\n2.1 Effective Hamiltonian\nHere we employ a nonrelativistic quark potential model to study the mass spectra of the fully-heavy tetraquark states. Accordingly, the effective Hamiltonian can be expressed as follow\nHef f = 4\u2211\ni=1 (mi + Ti ) \u2212 TC.M. + Vcon f + V conthyp , (1)\nwhere mi and Ti denote the constituent mass and kinetic energy of i-th quark, respectively, the second term \u2212TC.M. is to remove contributions from motions of the center of mass. VCon f stands for the quark confinement potential, in present\nmodel, we adopt the form [63,64]:\nVcon f = \u2211\ni< j\n\u2212 3 16\n( \u03bbci \u00b7 \u03bbcj ) (\nb ri j \u2212 4 3 \u03b1i j ri j + C0\n) , (2)\nwhere \u03bbc is the SU (3) Gell-mann matrix in color space, and the first term in the second bracket provides the longrange linear interaction, the second term provides the shortrange Coulomb interaction, and the last term is the zero point energy. b and \u03b1i j are the long-range coupling strength of quark confinement, QCD effective coupling constant between a quark pair, respectively.\nThe last term V conthyp in Eq. (1) is the residual (contact part) spin-dependent hyperfine interaction that should cause the mass splittings of different flavor-spin-color configurations, for which the most widely accepted versions are the one-gluon-exchange model (OGE), the Goldstone-boseexchange model (GBE) and the instanton-induced interaction (INS). The OGE model has been intensively applied to study mass spectra of both the traditional hadrons and the multiquark states. While the INS model has also been employed to reproduce the spectrum of the light hadrons and the single charm baryons [65\u201367], as well the tetraquark states with light quarks [68,69]. And the INS model has also been considered to investigate on the S-wave hidden- and doublecharmed tetraquark states very recently [63]. On the other hand, the GBE interaction between a quark\u2013antiquark pair in a multiquark system is often assumed to vanish [70\u201373]. Here, for the hyperfine potential V conthyp , we take into account the OGE or the INS interactions separately.\nIn the OGE model, the spin-dependent contact hyperfine interaction which cause the mass splitting is taken as the following form [74]:\nV contOGE = \u2212 \u03c0\n6\n\u2211\ni< j\n\u03b1i j ( \u03bbci \u00b7 \u03bbcj ) \u03c3i \u00b7 \u03c3 j mim j \u03b43 ( ri j ) , (3)\nwhere \u03c3i and \u03c3 j are the Pauli matrices. While the hyperfine interaction in the INS model is categorized into two parts [63, 68]:\nV contI N S = V contI N S (qq) + V contI N S (qq\u0304), (4)\nwith V contI N S (qq) and V cont I N S (qq\u0304) standing for the interactions between a quark\u2013quark pair and a quark\u2013antiquark pair, respectively. The explicit forms for them are\nV contI N S (qq) = \u2212 \u2211\ni< j\ng\u0302qqi j ( PS=1i j P C,6 i j + 2PS=0i j PC,3\u0304i j ) \u03b43 ( ri j ) , (5)\nV contI N S (qq\u0304) = \u2211\ni< j\ng\u0302qq\u0304i j\n[ 3\n2 PS=1i j P C,8 i j + PS=0i j\n( 1\n2 PC,8i j + 8PC,1i j\n)]\n\u00d7\u03b43 ( ri j ) , (6)\nwhere g\u0302qqi j and g\u0302 qq\u0304 i j are flavor-dependent coupling strength operators, explicit matrix elements of these operators in the light, strange and charm quark sectors have been given in Ref. [63], and the results including bottom quark are similar. PS=0i j and P S=1 i j are spin projector operators onto spin-singlet and spin-triplet states, respectively, and PC,3\u0304i j , P C,6 i j and P C,8 i j are color projector operators onto color anti-triplet 3\u0304c, color sextet 6c and color octet 8c, respectively. Note that one should keep in mind that the interaction between two antiquarks is of the same form as VqqI N S , if one changes all colours to anticolours and all flavours to their anti-flavour indices.\nNote that the presently employed hyperfine interaction is pure contact interaction, which should lead to an unbound Hamiltonian if we don\u2019t treat it perturbatively. Thus we need to regularize it as in Refs. [63,68],\n\u03b43 ( ri j ) \u2192 (\n\u03c3\u221a \u03c0\n)3 exp ( \u2212\u03c3 2 r2i j ) . (7)\nThe regularization parameter \u03c3 should be correlated to the finite size of constituent quarks and therefore flavor dependent, but here we just make \u03c3 to be a unified parameter for all the flavors, and absorb the flavor dependence into the coupling strengths, to reduce the free model parameters.\n2.2 Wave functions\nPresently, we consider the S-wave fully-heavy QQQ\u0304Q\u0304 tetraquark states, including the ccc\u0304c\u0304, bbb\u0304b\u0304, ccb\u0304b\u0304/bbc\u0304c\u0304, bcc\u0304c\u0304/ccb\u0304c\u0304, bcb\u0304b\u0304/bbb\u0304c\u0304, and bcb\u0304c\u0304 , states. Hereafter, we will not list the conjugate states such as bbc\u0304c\u0304. In general, the flavor configurations for the QQQ\u0304Q\u0304 system can be:\n|1\u3009 = {QQ}6c{Q\u0304 Q\u0304}6\u0304c , |2\u3009 = [QQ]3\u0304c [Q\u0304 Q\u0304]3c , |3\u3009 = {QQ}\u2217\u0304\n3c [Q\u0304 Q\u0304]3c , |4\u3009 = [QQ]3\u0304c{Q\u0304 Q\u0304}\u22173c ,\n|5\u3009 = [QQ]\u22176c{Q\u0304 Q\u0304}6\u0304c , |6\u3009 = {QQ}6c [Q\u0304 Q\u0304]\u2217\u03046c , |7\u3009 = {QQ}\u2217\u0304\n3c {Q\u0304 Q\u0304}\u22173c , |8\u3009 = [QQ]\u22176c [Q\u0304 Q\u0304]\u2217\u03046c , (8)\nwhere {\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 } denotes the permutation symmetric flavor state while [\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ] the anti-symmetric one for a two-quark (- antiquark) system. With or without the superscript \u2217 shows the spin-triplet or spin-singlet. The blackened number in the subscript denotes corresponding color symmetry of twoquark subsystem. Accordingly, we present all the possible flavor configurations with appropriate quantum numbers J PC in Table 1. To get the explicit matrix elements of the Hamiltonian, one has to solve the Shr\u00f6dinger equation of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (1). Here we employ the Gaussian functions expansion method (GFEM) [75], which has been applied to study the spectrum of petaquark states in Ref. [76] and QQq\u0304q\u0304\ntetraquark states in Ref. [77], and spectrum of the S-wave hidden- and double-charm tetraquark states in Ref. [63] very recently.\nIn GFEM, one can use a series of Gaussian functions to expand the orbital wave function of the S-wave tetraquark system as follow\n({ ri }) = 4\u220f\ni=1\nn\u2211\nl\nCil\n( 1\n\u03c0b2il\n)3/4 exp [ \u2212 1\n2b2il r2i\n] , (9)\nwhere the parameter {bil} can be related to the harmonic oscillator frequencies {\u03c9l} by 1/b2il = mi\u03c9l . In order to facil-\nitate the calculations, we take the ansatz that \u03c9l is independent to the quark mass as in Ref. [28], i.e., 1/b2il = 1/b2l = ml\u03c9l , then the spatial wave function can be simplified to be\n({ ri }) = n\u2211\nl\nCl\n4\u220f\ni=1\n(mi\u03c9l \u03c0 )3/4 exp [ \u2212mi\u03c9l 2 r2i ]\n= n\u2211\nl\nCl \u03c8 (\u03c9l , { ri }) . (10)\nIn addition, to remove contributions of the motion of the center of mass directly, here we used the Jacobi coordinates { ri } those are defiend as \u03be1 = r1 \u2212 r2, \u03be2 = r3 \u2212 r4, \u03be3 = m1 r1 + m2 r2\nm1 + m2 \u2212 m3 r3 + m4 r4 m3 + m4 ,\nR = m1 r1 + m2 r2 + m3 r3 + m4 r4 m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 , (11)\nwhere we have enumerated the two quarks by 1, 2 and the two antiquarks by 3, 4, respectively.\nFollowing the routine in Ref. [75], the parameters {bl} are set to be geometric series,\nbl = b1al\u22121 (l = 1, 2, . . . , n) , (12)\nwhere n is the number of Gaussian functions and a the ratio coefficient, then there are only thee parameters {b1, bn, n} need to be determined.\nNow we are able to compute the diagonal enlements of the Hamiltonian matrixes through solving the generalized matrix eigenvalue problem, using the patial wave function Eq. (10), the flavor \u00d7 spin \u00d7 color wave functions introduced in Eq., and Hamiltonian Eq. (1),\nn\u2211\nl\nn\u2211\nl \u2032 Cil\n( Hdll \u2032 \u2212 Edi Nll \u2032 ) Cil \u2032 = 0, (13)\nwhere i = 1\u2013n and\nHdll \u2032 =\u3008\u03c8 (\u03c9l) (FSC)|Hef f.|\u03c8 (\u03c9l \u2032) (FSC)\u3009, (14) Nll \u2032 =\u3008\u03c8 (\u03c9l) (FSC)|\u03c8 (\u03c9l \u2032) (FSC)\u3009, (15)\nhere (FSC) stand for flavor \u2297 spin \u2297 color wave function. One can choose a set of {b1, bn, n} tentatively, then extend and densify the harmonic oscillator length parameters until the minimum energy Edm , which should be correlative to the energy of psysical state according to the Rayleigh\u2013Ritz variational principle, becomes stable. In present work we take\n{b1, bn, n}={0.02fm, 6fm, 40}. At last, the nondiagonal elements of Hamiltonian matrices can be easily obtained using {Cml }.\n3 Numerical results and discussions\n3.1 Model parameters\nTo get the numerical results, a reliable set of parameters is required. The parameters in present model are the constituent quark masses, quark confinement strength b, QCD effective coupling constants {\u03b1 f f \u2032 } and the coupling strengths in INS hyperfine interaction {g f f \u2032 } for a two quark pair, the zero point energy C0, and the regulation parameter of the \u03b4 function \u03c3 . Here the constituent quark masses mn , ms and mc and corresponding coupling strengths are just taken to be the same values used in [63], for the constituent quark mass of the beauty quark mb, the empirical value is in the range 4900\u20135100 MeV [28,49], here we take it to be 5000 MeV tentatively.\nSince there is no solid experimental data for the spectrum of pure exotic states, thus it\u2019s impossible for us to fix the parameters by fitting the masses of tetraquark states. On the other hand, the presently employed quark confinement and hyperfine interactions are just the two-body interactions, namely, same as the description of traditional baryons and mesons in the constituent quark model. Consequently, here we try to give the values for present model parameters by fitting the masses of a set of the traditional ground state hadrons listed in PDG [78], using the INS and OGE models, respectively.\nAll the model parameters (used or not for estimation on the spectrum of fully-heavy tetraquark states in present work) in each model are collected in Table 2, and the corresponding fitting results compared to the experimental data are shown in Table 3. As we can see in the tables, the experimental data can be well reproduced in both the INS and OGE models with a set of reasonable values for the model parameters. One may note that the \u03b7c and \u03b7b mesons In INS model have not been considered in the fitting procedure. This is because of that the INS interaction vanishes between a quark\u2013antiquark with the same flavor, and this should yield unreasonable numerical results that the \u03b7c(b) and J/\u03c8(\u03d2) are degenerated states. To solve this problem, one has to consider mixing between the pseudoscalar mesons qq\u0304 with the quark and antiquark being the same flavor naturally caused by the instanton interaction [79], while there is not solid experimental data for this kind of mixing angles, therefore, these meson states have not been taken into account. While masses of all the other hadrons obtained in INS model are perfectly consistent with the experimental data, as we can see in Table 3.\nStraightforwardly, one can calculate the energies of ground S-wave fully-heavy tetraquark systems with the model parameters in Table 2. The final numerical results for the ccc\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304b\u0304 states, ccb\u0304b\u0304 states and bcb\u0304c\u0304 states, and ccb\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304c\u0304 states are presented in Table 4, Table 5 and Table 6, respectively. In the following three subsections, we will discuss the numerical results of the different kinds of fully-heavy tetraquark states respectively.\n3.2 The ccc\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304b\u0304 states\nThe numerical results for the spectrum of ccc\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304b\u0304 states withe quantum numbers J PC = 0++, 1+\u2212 and 2++ in both the presently employed INS and OGE models are\npresented in Table 4, compared to some of the predictions by quark models [10,14,18,19,28]. As we can see in the table, the S-wave ccc\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304b\u0304 states falls in the range \u223c 6400\u20136500 MeV and \u223c 19,200 MeV, respectively. This is in general consistent with most of the theoretical predictions by various of theoretical approaches. For instance, in the early work [10], a quark model with a two-body potential due to color-octet exchange were employed to study the all-charm tetraquark states, and the obtained energies of the S-wave ccc\u0304c\u0304 states were \u223c 6400 MeV. In a recent work base on the QCD sum rule framework [17], the predicted ccc\u0304c\u0304 states fall in the range 6400\u20136800 MeV. And the quark models predict the S-wave bbb\u0304b\u0304 states fall in the range 18,700\u201318,900 MeV in Refs. [19,24], but 19,300 MeV in Ref. [28].\nEspecially, in a recent work [28], the fully-heavy QQQ\u0304Q\u0304 states has been investigated using the constituent quark model with the OGE interaction, which is almost the same as the presently employed OGE model with only a few differences in the details of the fitting and calculation procedure. Numerical results for spectrum of the S-wave ccc\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304b\u0304 states in [28] are in general close to but a little bit higher than the presently obtained ones in the OGE model. It\u2019s because of that a zero point energy C0 = \u2212301 MeV in the quark confinement potential is considered in present OGE model, although the constituent masses of the charm and beauty quark are taken to be higher values than in Ref. [28].\nFor the ccc\u0304c\u0304 states, the obtained energies in both the INS and OGE models suggest that the experimentally observed X (6900) by LHCb [8] may not be the S-wave tetraquark state, but a radially or orbitally excited state, since the obtained energies are \u223c 400 MeV lower than X (6900). And the CMS reported X (7300) [58] is \u223c 800 MeV higher than the presently obtained states. While the presently obtained energies just fall in the range of the broad structure reported by LHCb [8].\nIn addition, the obtained energy \u223c 6500 MeV of the ccc\u0304c\u0304 states is very close to the very recently reported X (6600) state by CMS and ATLAS collaborations [58,59], therefore, one may expect that the X (6600) state should be dominated by the S-wave ccc\u0304c\u0304 tetraquark component.

And the all-charm tetraquark states are studied in the framework of QCD sum rule in [51], where the X (6600) state is assigned to be the first radially excited ccc\u0304c\u0304 state with J PC = 0++. In Ref. [81], it\u2019s shown that contributions of four characteristic intermediate channels \u03b7c\u03c7c1, J/\u03c8\u03c8(3686), \u03c7c0\u03c7c1 and \u03c7c2\u03c7c2 are required to reproduce the CMS distribution.\nConcerning the other components in X (6600), the di-J/\u03c8 molecular bound state with quantum number J PC = 0++ or 2++ whose threshold is just \u223c 200\u2013300 MeV lower than the presently obtained ccc\u0304c\u0304 states should be expected. Generally, mixing between the tetraquark state and the molecular state should raise up energy of the higher state which is dominated by the ccc\u0304c\u0304. Consequently, an admixture of the presently obtained S-wave ccc\u0304c\u0304 component (dominant one) and a diJ/\u03c8 molecular component may account for the experimentally observed X (6600). And one may also expect that the presently obtained ccc\u0304c\u0304 state with J PC = 1+\u2212 should couple to the \u03b7c J/\u03c8 molecular state. Therefore, it\u2019s difficult to determine the quantum number of X (6600) by present model, although J PC = 0++ may be the most prefered one, since energies of the states with different quantum numbers are close.\nSimilarly, one may also expect the mixing between the bbb\u0304b\u0304 states with J PC = 0++ or 2++ in present model and the di-\u03d2 molecular state, and the states with J PC = 1\u2212+ and \u03b7b\u03d2 molecular state, since energies of the presently obtained states are very close to either the di-\u03d2 threshold 18,920 MeV, or the \u03b7b\u03d2 threshold 18,859 MeV. While there is no convincing experimental signature for candidates of the exotic beauty-full state up to now, hope the future LHCb and CMS experiments could provide more information on this kind of exotic meson states.\nOn the other hand, as one can see in Table 4, the obtained ccc\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304b\u0304 states with different quantum numbers are\ndegenerated in the INS model, additionally, there is no mixing between different flavor-spin-color configurations. But the mixing effects in the OGE model are very strong. It\u2019s because of that the INS interaction vanishes in these configurations, thus only the quark confinement potential which doesn\u2019t cause the mass splittings contributes to the energies. While mass splittings about several tens MeV for the states with different quantum numbers are obtained in the OGE model. Tentatively, to distinguish the states with different quantum numbers in INS model, one can roughly estimate the mixing of ccc\u0304c\u0304 states with different quantum numbers and the recently predicted hidden charm tetraquark states cc\u0304nn\u0304 and cc\u0304ss\u0304 in Ref. [63] naturally caused by the INS interactions between the quark\u2013antiquark pairs. The different mixing coefficients should result in the non-degenerate state, but the mixing effects cannot be very strong [63]. On the other hand, one can also take the mixing between the presently studied bb\u0304bb\u0304 states and the bb\u0304nn\u0304 and bb\u0304ss\u0304 states in the INS model, which should cause the mass splittings of the bb\u0304bb\u0304 states with different quantum numbers.\n3.3 The ccb\u0304b\u0304, bcb\u0304c\u0304, ccb\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304c\u0304 states\nAs we can see in Tables 5 and 6, the ccb\u0304b\u0304 and bcb\u0304c\u0304 states fall in the range \u223c 12,850\u00b150 MeV, and the ccb\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304c\u0304 states are located at \u223c 9650 \u00b1 50 MeV and \u223c 16,050 \u00b1 50 MeV, respectively. All the numerical results are in general consistent with the predictions by other theoretical investigations.\nSimilar to the case of the ccc\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304b\u0304 states, the obtained energies in the INS model are in general lower than those obtained in the OGE model. Note that since the zero point energyC0 is considered in the present work, the numerical results in both the INS and OGE models are about several tens (or up to 100) MeV lower than the predicted values in Ref. [28] where the OGE interactions are considered in the constituent quark model.\nWhile in the INS model, it\u2019s different from the ccc\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304b\u0304 states, the obtained ccb\u0304b\u0304, bcb\u0304c\u0304, ccb\u0304c\u0304 and bbb\u0304c\u0304 states with different quantum numbers are non-degenerate since the INS interactions survive in these states, in addition, mixing between the different flavor-spin-color configurations is also caused by INS interactions between quarks. And in both of the INS and OGE models, the configuration mixing effects are very strong, as shown in columns CI NS and COGE of the Tables 5 and 6.\nNote that the bcb\u0304c\u0304 states should also mix with the ccc\u0304c\u0304 or bbb\u0304b\u0304 states in the INS model. While the mixing should be expected to be very small because of that the coupling\nstrength gbc is about one order smaller than gnc and gns . Thus here we don\u2019t discuss much about this kind of mixing. While mixing between the presently tetraquark states and the meson-meson molecular states, for instance, the mixing of the bcb\u0304c\u0304 states with proper quantum numbers and J/\u03c8\u03d2 or \u03b7c\u03d2 should be more interesting in future theoretical investigations."

The model parameters in both the two employed models are determined by fitting them to the mass spectrum of the traditional qq\u0304 and qqq hadron states.\nThe theoretical calculations here show that the ground ccc\u0304c\u0304 state is with mass around 6500 MeV, thus the experimentally observed X (6900) state may not be an S-wave ccc\u0304c\u0304 tetraquark state, but it could be a radially or orbitally excited state of ccc\u0304c\u0304. In addition, the very recently reported all-charm structure X (7300) also cannot be explained by the S-wave tetraquark state. This is in agreement with most of the previous predictions by various of other approaches.\nWhile the presently studied ccc\u0304c\u0304 tetraquark state with quantum number J PC = 0++, color configuration of the quark\u2013quark and antiquark\u2013antiquark being 6c\u22976\u0304c, and both the quark pair and antiquark pair being the spin singlet, may be the dominant component in the very recently reported X (6600) state by CMS and ATLAS collaborations.\nAcknowledgements This work is partly supported by the Chongqing Natural Science Foundation under Project nos. cstc2021jcyj-msxm X0078 and cstc2019jcyj-msxmX0409, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant nos. 12075288, 12075133, 11735003, 11961141012 and 11835015.
