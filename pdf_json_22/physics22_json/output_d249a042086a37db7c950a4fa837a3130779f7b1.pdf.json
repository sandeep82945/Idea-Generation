    "abstractText": "Efficient discretisations of gauge groups are crucial with the long term perspective of using tensor networks or quantum computers for lattice gauge theory simulations. For any Lie group other than U(1), however, there is no class of asymptotically dense discrete subgroups. Therefore, discretisations limited to subgroups are bound to lead to a freezing of Monte Carlo simulations at weak couplings, necessitating alternative partitionings without a group structure. In this work we provide a comprehensive analysis of this freezing for all discrete subgroups of SU(2) and different classes of asymptotically dense subsets. We find that an appropriate choice of the subset allows unfrozen simulations for arbitrary couplings, though one has to be careful with varying weights of unevenly distributed points. A generalised version of the Fibonacci spiral appears to be particularly efficient and close to optimal.",

            "text": "Gauge theories represent the main ingredients to the current standard model (SM) of particle physics, which unifies the electromagnetic, the weak and the strong interactions. Despite the tremendous success of the SM, first principle calculations in non-Abelian gauge theories underlying for instance quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which describes the strongly interacting part of the SM, are still challenging. In the last decades lattice field theoretical methods have been developed and optimised with great success to provide a non-perturbative approach for the investigation of such gauge theories using Monte Carlo (MC) methods.\nHowever, studying QCD for instance at finite density or its real time dynamics is difficult if not impossible with MC\na e-mail: urbach@hiskp.uni-bonn.de (corresponding author)\nmethods, either due to the sign problem or because Euclidean space-time is used. Here is where methods based on the Hamiltonian formalism in Minkowski space-time can provide a way out. In fact, tensor network methods have seen very rapid developments in the recent years towards the possibility of simulations in 2+1 and 3+1 space-time dimensions [1,2]. And the number of qubits available on real quantum devices is ever increasing. This offers a prospect for studying gauge theories with tensor network methods or on quantum computers in the not too distant future.\nThe Hamiltonian formalism for non-Abelian gauge theories with or without matter content was presented a long time ago in Ref. [3]. Its implementation with TN methods or on a quantum computer, however, requires some form of digitisation of SU(N ).\nThere are different ways to digitise SU(N ) or more specifically SU(2) which we will study in this paper. One can for instance chose a discrete subgroup of SU(2). In the early days of lattice gauge theory simulations such discrete subgroups were already investigated to improve the efficiency of the simulation programmes. Soon it was realised that due to the finite number of elements in such subgroups a so-called freezing phase transition occurs at some critical \u03b2-value [4,5]. For \u03b2-values larger than this critical value MC simulations are no longer reliable, because they result in the wrong distribution (for results in a ZN gauge theory see Refs. [6,7].). There exist different approaches to overcome this problem: one is to chose a subgroup with a larger number of elements, if available. The alternative is to improve the action in order to be able to simulate at relevant values of the lattice spacing. We are going to follow the former here, because it can be applied in addition to improved actions and the two approaches are in some sense orthogonal.\nWith the rising interest in quantum computation, interest in digitisations of gauge groups also increased again:\nin Ref. [8] a geodesic mesh was used to discretise SU(2). The authors study systematic effects of this discretisation in detail around \u03b2 = 2, a choice motivated by the onset of the scaling region.\nFor the gauge group SU(3) particular choices of digitisations were first studied in Refs. [9\u201312]. For this gauge group, however, improving the action is mandatory [10], otherwise simulations at values of the lattice spacing in the interesting region are not possible. Recently it was shown that with modified gauge action and a particular SU(3) subgroup MC simulations are feasible with sufficiently small lattice spacing values [13\u201316].\nWhile discrete subgroups have the advantage that they are closed under multiplication, there is no flexibility in the number of group elements. This motivates using the isomorphy between SU(2) and the sphere S3 in four dimensions. The aim is then to find points on S3 depending on some parameter m which are dense in S3 as m approaches infinity.\nIn this paper we investigate all the discrete subgroups of SU(2) and several representative discretisations of S3. We study the freezing transition as a function of the number of elements in these discretisations and show that the discretisation based on so-called Fibonacci lattices behaves optimally. By doing so we go significantly beyond what was done in Ref. [8] in studying discretisations which have not been studied before. Moreover, we study the critical \u03b2-value of the freezing transition for the different discretisations and compare and connect to the analytical understanding of this phase transition."

Here, V is a random element of SU(N ) with average distance \u03b4 to the identity element. The average distance, measured using some norm, determines the acceptance rate of the MC algorithm.\nThe actual value of \u03b4 needs to be adjusted to tune the acceptance rate to about 50%, which implies that for \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e one needs to decrease \u03b4 further and further.\nIn numerical simulations, one nowadays represents an element U of SU(N ) by an N \u00d7 N complex valued matrix and constrains it to be unitary with unit determinant. Every complex number is then represented by two floating point numbers with accuracy limited by the adopted data type (usually double precisions floating point numbers). The results obtained with this quasi continuous representation of SU(2) will be referred to as reference results in the following. It imposes, for \u03b2-values of practical relevance, no restriction on the possible elements U \u2032: small enough distances \u03b4 are possible.\nHowever, this is not necessarily the case if a finite set of elements of SU(N ) is to be used, like for instance a finite subgroup of SU(N ). Here, there is a lower bound for the distance between two available elements, which significantly restricts the possible proposal gauge links. For too large \u03b2values, therefore, the acceptance drops to (almost) zero, an effect that was dubbed freezing transition [4].\nThis transition can be pushed towards larger and larger \u03b2-values by increasing the number of elements in the set. Since there are in general no finite subgroups of SU(N ) with arbitrarily many elements available, one needs to resort to sets of elements which do not form a subgroup of SU(N ), but which lie asymptotically dense and are as isotropically as possible distributed in the group. We will call these sets partitionings of SU(N ).\nFocusing on SU(2), we discuss first some finite subgroups followed by other partitionings of SU(2).\n3.1 Finite subgroups of SU(2)\nDue to the double cover relation between SU(2) and SO(3), finite subgroups of SU(2) can be constructed by taking the Cartesian product of the cyclic group of order 2 with the subgroups of SO(3). Subgroups of SO(3) are obtained by considering the symmetry transformations of regular polygons, as well as the rotational symmetries of platonic solids [18].\nIn the following we will consider the binary tetrahedral group T , the binary octahedral group O and the binary icosahedral group I , with 24, 48 and 120 elements respectively. Their elements are evenly distributed across the whole group, and research on their behavior has already been conducted [4]. The last four-dimensional finite subgroup of SU(2) is the binary dihedral group D4 with 8 elements. One possible representation of these groups can be found in Table 1.\n3.2 Asymptotically dense partitionings of SU(2)\nFor generating partitionings of SU(2), we use the isomorphy between SU(2) and the sphere S3 in four dimensions, which is defined by x \u2208 S3 \u21d4 (\nx0 + ix1 x2 + ix3 \u2212x2 + ix3 x0 \u2212 ix1\n) \u2208 SU(2). (5)\nFor such partitionings, the number of elements can be increased very easily, i.e. the discretisation of SU(2) can be made arbitrarily fine.\nThe reduction approach of SU(2) to a sphere can be generalised to general U(N ) and SU(N ) which can be expressed as products of spheres. To this end, we note that U(1) is isomorphic to S1 and U(N ) \u223c= SU(N ) U(1) where denotes the semi-direct product. This follows from the existence of the short exact sequence 1 \u2192 SU(N ) \u2192 U(N ) det\u2212\u2192 U(1) \u2192 1. With respect to SU(N ),1 we note that SU(N ) acts transitively on S2N\u22121 since the point (1, 0, 0, . . . , 0) is mapped to a\n1 For more detail, see e.g. chapter 22.2c in [20].\npoint z by any element of SU(N ) whose first column is z, and the isotropy subgroup of (1, 0, 0, . . . , 0) is the SU(N \u2212 1) embedding\n( 1 0 0 SU(N \u2212 1) ) .\nHence, we obtain\nSU(N \u2212 1) \u2192 SU(N ) \u2192 SU(N )/SU(N \u2212 1) \u223c= S2N\u22121 which implies that SU(N ) is a principal bundle over S2N\u22121 with fibre SU(N \u2212 1). Thus, by induction with SU(2) \u223c= S3, we can express SU(N ) as a product of odd-dimensional spheres S3, S5, . . ., S2N\u22121, and U(N ) as a product of odddimensional spheres S1, S3, . . ., S2N\u22121.\nOur aim is therefore to find a discretisation scheme of the k-dimensional sphere Sk depending on some parameter m so that the discretising set Smk is dense in Sk asm goes to infinity. The following examples all meet this requirement. Yet they differ in the measure or probabilistic weight attributed to each point. This measure w is defined as the volume of the Voronoi cell [21,22] of the point using the canonical metric on Sk derived from the Euclidean distance, i.e. the measure is the volume of that part of the sphere closer to the given point than to any other point."

It offers an elegant and deterministic solution to the problem of distributing a given amount of points on a twodimensional surface. Fibonacci lattices are used in numerous fields of research such as numerical analysis or computer graphics, mostly to approximate spheres (as e.g. shown in Fig. 1). Mainly inspired by [25], we will now construct a similar lattice for S3.\nThe two-dimensional Fibonacci lattice is usually constructed within a unit square [0, 1)2 as\n2n = { t\u0303m \u2223\u22230 \u2264 m < n, m \u2208 N}\nwith t\u0303m = ( xm ym ) = (m \u03c4 mod 1, m n )t ,\n\u03c4 = 1 + \u221a 5\n2 .\nThis can be generalized to the hypercube [0, 1)k embedded in Rk :\nkn = { tm \u2223\u22230 \u2264 m < n, m \u2208 N}\ntm =\n\u239b\n\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d t1m t2m ...\ntkm\n\u239e\n\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0 =\n\u239b\n\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d\nm n\na1 m mod 1 ... ak\u22121 m mod 1\n\u239e\n\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0\nwith ai a j /\u2208 Q for i = j ,\nwhere Q denotes the field of rational numbers. The square roots of the prime numbers provide a simple choice for the constants ai : (a1, a2, a3, . . . ) = ( \u221a 2, \u221a 3, \u221a 5, . . . ).\nThe points in kn are then evenly distributed within the given Volume.

Therefore, the metric tensor gi j in terms of the spherical coordinates (y1, y2, y3) := (\u03c8, \u03b8, \u03c6) is given by\ngi j = \u2202z a \u2202yi \u2202zb \u2202y j \u03b4ab =\n\u239b \u239d 1 0 0 0 sin2 \u03c8 0 0 0 sin2 \u03c8 sin2 \u03b8 \u239e \u23a0\ni j\n.\nFrom this one can calculate the Jacobian \u221a|g| to be\n\u221a|g| = sin2 \u03c8 sin \u03b8 .\nAs \u221a|g| factorizes nicely into functions only dependent on one coordinate, one can construct a bijective map \u22121 mapping S3 to [0, 1)3 given by \u22121(\u03c8, \u03b8, \u03c6) =( \u221211 (\u03c8), \u22121 2 (\u03b8), \u22121 3 (\u03c6) ) with\n\u221211 (\u03c8) = \u222b \u03c8 0 d\u03c8\u0303 sin 2 \u03c8\u0303\n\u222b \u03c0 0 d\u03c8\u0303 sin 2 \u03c8\u0303 = 1 \u03c0\n( \u03c8 \u2212 1\n2 sin(2\u03c8)\n)\n\u221212 (\u03b8) = \u222b \u03b8\n0 d\u03b8\u0303 sin \u03b8\u222b \u03c0 0 d\u03b8\u0303 sin \u03b8 = 1 2 (1 \u2212 cos(\u03b8))\n\u221213 (\u03c6) = \u222b \u03c6\n0 d\u03c6\u0303\u222b 2\u03c0 0 d\u03c6\u0303 = 1 2\u03c0 \u03c6.\nLooking at some measurable set = \u22121(\u0303) one can see that the inverse map ( \u22121)\u22121 \u2261 trivially fulfils equation Eq.

In this case w(U ) = 1 \u2200 U and the proposal is generated via U \u2032\u03bc(n) = V \u00b7 U\u03bc(n), as explained above.

In the lower panel we compare to the corresponding strong coupling expansion and find very good agreement.\nFor the subgroups the proposal step is implemented by multiplication of U\u03bc(n) with one of the elements V of the subgroup adjacent to the identity. Also in this case the weights w are constant.\nIn the case of the Genz points, the linear discretisation and the Volleyball neighbouring points in the partitioning can be found by geometric considerations as explained in the previous section. A proposal is chosen uniformly random from the set of neighbouring points. For the Genz points we do not take the weights w into account, because of their complex dependence on the direction and the point itself. For the linear and the Volleyball discretisations we compare simulations with and without taking the approximate weights Eqs. (16) and (23) into account.\nDue to the locally irregular structure of the Fibonacci lattices finding the appropriate neighboring elements is not as straightforward as in the case of the other partitionings. Therefore, we pregenerate a neighbour list for each element of the Fibonacci set based on the geometric distance. This list is read and used during the update process.\nIn order to study the freezing transition, we follow the following procedure. For a given \u03b2-value we perform a hot (random gauge field) and a cold (unit gauge field) start separately. This is repeated for \u03b2-values from \u03b2i 1 to \u03b2 f in steps of \u03b2. The phase transition is indicated by either the fact that hot and cold starts do not equilibrate to the same average plaquette expectation value for \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b2c with one of the two, typically the cold start, deviating from the reference result. Or a significant deviation from the reference result is seen for \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b2c for both, hot and cold start.\nFor the purpose of this paper we define the critical value of \u03b2, denoted as \u03b2c as the smallest value of \u03b2 for which forward and backward branches do not agree within errors. In practice, this will only be a lower bound for \u03b2c.\nStatistical errors are computed based on the so-called - method detailed in Ref. [28] and implemented in the publicly available software package hadron [29].\nFinally, we would like to point out one important difference in methodology compared to Ref. [8]: we run the MC algorithm directly on the discrete set of SU(2) elements, while the authors of Ref. [8] run what we call the reference algorithm and project to the discrete set afterwards. Then they study different ways to project onto the discrete set."

            "text": "5.1 Influence of weights\nOne important difference between finite subgroups and the partitionings discussed above is the need for weights in the case of the partitionings. In order to study the influence of weights, we compare here Genz points with the linear discretisation for simplicity in d = 1 + 1 dimensions for L2 = 1002 lattices.\nIn Fig. 3 we compare the plaquette expectation value obtained from MC simulations with Genz points to those with the linear discretisation with and without weighting taken into account for \u03b2 = 4.0. The comparison is performed for values of m in the range from 5 to 200, which adjusts the fineness of the partitioning. The reference result \u2013 generated with the reference algorithm as discussed above, is indicated by the red solid line and the corresponding statistical uncertainty by the dashed red lines. This \u03b2-value is representative. Only at very small \u03b2-value, no dependence on m can be observed.\nWe observe for the Genz points the strong influence of missing weights. As expected from our estimate of the weights, the deviation from the reference result increases with increasing m.\nIn contrast, the linear discretisation without weighting converges towards the reference result with increasing m. The smallish deviations from the reference result at small m-values can be reduced significantly (if not removed completely) by including the weights in the MC simulation. This observation appears is largely independent of \u03b2.\nWe conclude from these results that it is not worthwhile to further consider the Genz points. For the linear partitioning it turns out that the weights appear to be important for small m-values, but become negligible for large m. However, this might also depend on the observable.\nNote that there are alternative methods than the reweighting as described here to avoid biases, for instance projection schemes [8]. We find the weight based method more intuitive and computationally more efficient though.\n5.2 Freezing transition\nWe study the freezing transition using simulations of the SU(2) gauge theory in 3+1 dimensions with L4 = 84 lattice volume. We look at \u03b2 \u2208 {0.1, 0.2, . . . , 9.9, 10.0}. For each value of \u03b2, 7000 sweeps are performed, once with a hot, and once with a cold starting configuration. During a single sweep every lattice site and direction is probed Nhit = 10 times. The plaquette is then measured by averaging over the last 3000 iterations.\nSuch scans in \u03b2 can be found in Fig. 4. \u03b2c is then estimated to be the last value before a significant jump in \u3008P\u3009, or a\nnqubits per link\nsignificant disagreement between the hot and cold start2. We have checked that the such determined critical \u03b2-values do not depend significantly on the volume.\nIn Fig. 5 we show the \u03b2c-values at which the freezing transitions takes place as a function of the number n of elements in the set of points or the subgroups. We compare the Fibonacci, the linear and the Volleyball partitioning, and the finite subgroups of SU(2). For the linear and the Volleyball partitioning we also distinguish between results with and without including weighting to correct for the different Voronoi cell volumes. The corresponding results are also tabularised in Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5. For the Fibonacci partitioning we tabularise only results for selected n values.\nAlso note that our \u03b2c-values for the finite subgroups T , O and I reproduce the ones given in Ref. [4].\nFigure 5 suggests that all our SU(2) discretisations behave qualitatively similar. However, at fixed n-value the subgroups, linear and Volleyball partitionings do have smaller \u03b2c-values compared to the Fibonacci lattice. Moreover, we observe a significant difference between simulations with and without weighting included. This difference increases with increasing n.\n2 Fibonacci lattices usually show the latter behavior, which is why we increase the number of thermalization sweeps to 10 000. This marginally raised the values of \u03b2c.\nTable 2 \u03b2c-values for selected Fibonacci lattice partitionings of SU(2) for d = 4 and 84 lattices.

We remark that for a SU(2) gauge theory the relevant region of \u03b2-values is around \u03b2 = 2, where one enters the scaling region, which is sufficient to reach for traditional MC simulations [13\u201315].\nIn Ref. [4] the authors find that the critical \u03b2-value can be computed theoretically, at least approximately, for the finite subgroups. It is based on an analytical calculation of \u03b2c(N ) for ZN , which is generalised to finite subgroups as follows: for the subgroup G, the authors define the set of elements C(G) closest to the identity, but excluding the identity itself. Close to the freezing transition, plaquettes are made of identity links, or g, g\u22121 \u2208 C(G) for minimal changes compared to unit plaquettes. Next, they define N (the cyclic order) as the minimal integer for which gN = 1. The corresponding subgroup generated by g is isomorphic to ZN . For the four groups D\u03044, T , O and I one finds N = 4, 6, 8 and 10, respectively. This leads to the following expectation for the critical \u03b2-value as a function of N\n\u03b2c(N ) \u2248 ln ( 1 + \u221a2 )\n1 \u2212 cos(2\u03c0/N ) . (30)\nHowever, for Fibonacci, linear and Volleyball partitionings we no longer deal with subgroups. In particular, taking one of the elements e closest to the identity element, it is not guaranteed that there is an N \u2208 N for which eN = 1.\nThus, we have to approximate the order N . For (approximately) isotropic discretisations such as the finite subgroups and the Fibonacci partitioning a global average over the point density is bound to yield a good approximation for the elements in C(G) and therefore N . The volume of the three dimensional unit sphere is 2\u03c02. If we then assume a locally primitive cubic lattice, the average distance of n points in S3 becomes d(n) = ( 2\u03c02\nn\n)1/3 . (31)\nTwo points of this distance together with the origin form a triangle with the opening angle\n\u03b1(n) = 2 arcsin d(n) 2 , (32)\nthus a first approximation of the cyclic order is obtained by\nN\u0303 (n) = 2\u03c0 \u03b1(n) , (33)\nwhich solely depends on the number n of elements in the partition.\nNote that the assumption of a primitive cubic lattice is even asymptotically incorrect for all the partitionings discussed in this work and at best a good approximation. How good an approximation it is, can only be checked numerically. In specific cases it needs further refinement.\nIn particular, in the case of the Fibonacci partitioning the approximation has to be adjusted. Since the points are distributed irregularly in this case, a path going around the sphere does not lie in a two-dimensional plane. Instead it follows some zigzag route which is longer than the straight path. Assuming the optimal maximally dense packing, we expect the points to lie at the vertices of tetrahedra locally tiling the sphere. The length of the straight path would then correspond to the height of the tetrahedron whereas the length of the actual path corresponds to the edge length. Their ratio is\u221a\n3 2 , so N\u0303 has to be rescaled by this factor to best describe\n\u03b2c for the Fibonacci partitioning. We show the curve Eq. (30) using N\u0303 (n) and \u221a 3/2N\u0303 , respectively, in addition to the data in Fig. 5. The version with N\u0303 is in very good agreement with the results obtained for the finite subgroups while the rescaled version matches the values for the Fibonacci partitioning remarkably well.\nThe unweighted simulations of the Volleyball and the weighted simulations of the linear discretisations also yield"

            "text": "Some of the results presented in the previous section deserve separate discussion. Figure 5 shows that the Fibonacci lattice discretisation has larger \u03b2c-values at fixed n compared to the finite subgroups and the other partitionings. This can be understood due to the irregularity of the points in the Fibonacci lattices: at fixed n, this irregularity will generate minimal distances between points which are smaller than the ones for the other discretisations. Thus, the freezing transition should appear at comparably larger \u03b2 values only, because smaller values of | S| are available.\nAlso the difference in \u03b2c between simulations with and without weight included for the linear and Volleyball partitionings, respectively, can be understood qualitatively. Assume the system freezes for the weighted case at some value \u03b2wc . Switching off the weighting, there will be subsets of points with on average lower (or larger) distances between elements than the average distance. In these regions the | S| values required for acceptance will be smaller than the average | S| value at this \u03b2. And it is reasonable to assume that these regions are also reached during equilibration. Thus, the critical \u03b2-value for the not weighted simulation \u03b2nw must be larger or equal \u03b2w.\nThough this trend is universal, we find an additional superiority of the linear as compared to the Volleyball discretisation. We expect this to be a consequence of the denser packing of the linear discretisation where most of the points have twelve neighbours whereas the majority of the points in the Volleyball discretisation has only six neighbours.\nWe have obtained excellent predictions for the \u03b2c-values for finite subgroups and Fibonacci partitionings. For finite subgroups the prediction using N\u0303 is even better than the prediction using N , in particular for larger n. For the Fibonacci partitionings the rescaling with the factor \u221a 3/2 suggests that the Fibonacci elements are close to maximally densely packed. This is strongly backed up by the numerical evidence. Based on this assumption of closest-packing we postulate\nthat there is no discretisation scheme yielding a significantly later freezing transition than the Fibonacci partitioning at an equal number of points.\nFinally, the predicted \u03b2c values do not agree with our observations for the unweighted linear and the weighted Volleyball discretisations, respectively. We do not fully understand these discrepancies, but it suggests that the linear discretisation has subsets of elements which are close to maximally densely packed. And the Volleyball discretisation is in this regard sub-optimal.\nIn Sect. 3.2 we have explained how SU(N ) can be expressed as a product of odd-dimensional spheres S3, S5, . . ., S2N\u22121. Since the k-dimensional hypervolume H(Sk) \u2261 2\u03c0 k+1 2 / ( k+1 2 ) of the k-sphere is well known, we can generalise the prediction of \u03b2c to N > 2 by adjusting the average distance from Eq. (31)\ndN (n) = \u239b\n\u239d1 n\n2N\u22121\u220f\nk=3,odd H(Sk)\n\u239e\n\u23a0 1/(N2\u22121)\n(34)\nand applying Eq. (33) and Eq. (30) successively as before. In particular, this formula readily predicts critical couplings for the finite subgroups of SU(3) which have been determined by Bhanot and Rebbi [30]. We show how our prediction compares to the values obtained by Bhanot and Rebbi in Fig. 6. In addition to the results for \u03b2c given in the paper originally (black circles), we plot the leftmost bounds of the hysteresis loops3 they visualised, denoting the minimal possible value of \u03b2c (red squares). The systematic effect stemming from different estimations of \u03b2c is remarkably large. We therefore refrain from any conclusion as to the quantitative correctness of our prediction. Nevertheless it seems well suited to predict the qualitative scaling of the freezing transition and it provides the correct order of magnitude.\nIn this light it is also interesting to discuss the number of qubits nqubits per link needed to represent these discretisations on a quantum computer. nqubits is of course related to the number of elements via nqubits = log2(n). For SU(2) (see Fig. 5) the usage of the Fibonacci discretisation would mean only a single qubit improvement per link compared to the other discretisations. While this does not sound like much, it might be crucial on so-called near-term noisy quantum devices. Moreover, the added flexibility might be of great help.\nAs argued in Refs. [13\u201315] it is in principle sufficient to reach the scaling region, which for SU(2) starts around \u03b2 = 2. However, with a quantum device one could in principle reach very large \u03b2-values without suffering from the\n3 The hysteresis loop is formed by the different values of the plaquette corresponding to hot and cold starts, respectively. The minimal \u03b2c is the first point where these results do not agree.\nlimitations of MC algorithms. At such \u03b2-values one could then seamlessly connect to perturbation theory. Here, the added flexibility of the Fibonacci discretisation could, again, be of large help. Moreover, if indeed \u221a 3/2N\u0303 is relevant also for SU(3) with the Fibonacci discretisation, the saving in the number of qubits per link is much larger than for SU(2) and might become highly relevant (compare the black dashed with the red dotted line in Fig. 6!)."

            "text": "In this paper we have presented several asymptotically dense partitionings of SU(2), which do not represent subgroups of SU(2) but which have adjustable numbers of elements. The discussed partitionings are not necessarily isotropically distributed in the group, which requires in principle the inclusion of additional weight factors in the Monte Carlo algorithms. We have investigated whether or not the partitionings without and, if possible, with weights included can be used in Monte Carlo simulations of SU(2) lattice gauge theories by comparing the plaquette expectation value as a function of \u03b2 to reference results of a standard lattice gauge simulation.\nThis comparison rules out the usage of the so-called Genz partitioning, because the weights are difficult to compute and\nthe difference due to not included weights increases with the number of elements. Thus, Monte Carlo simulations with fine Genz partitionings of SU(2) are not feasible.\nFor the other considered partitionings, this comparison turned out to give good agreement with the standard simulation code, in particular when the weights are included. Moreover, the finer the discretisation (and the larger the number of elements) the smaller the deviation between simulations with and without weighting.\nIn addition we have investigated the so-called freezing transition for the partitions and for all finite subgroups of SU(2). The main result visualised in Fig. 5 is that the partitioning Fk based on Fibonacci lattices allows for a flexible choice of the number of elements by adjusting k and at the same time larger \u03b2c-values compared to finite subgroups and the other discussed partitionings. Thus, Fibonacci based discretisations provide the largest simulatable\u03b2-range at fixedn.\nComing back to the introduction, using the partitionings proposed here does not pose any problem even at very large \u03b2-values at least in Monte Carlo simulations. This leaves us optimistic for their applicability in the Hamiltonian formalism for tensor network or quantum computing applications.\nFinally, the generalisation of the partitionings discussed here to the case of SU(3) relevant for quantum chromodynamics is straightforward and we expect that the results obtained in this paper directly translate to this larger group. It becomes again clear that in the SU(3) case one also needs to improve the lattice action to avoid the freezing problem. However, the saving due to the Fibonacci discretisation would be much larger than for SU(2) if our prediction turns out to be correct.\nAcknowledgements This work is supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) and the NSFC through the funds provided to the Sino-German Collaborative Research Center CRC 110 \u201cSymmetries and the Emergence of Structure in QCD\u201d (DFG Project-ID 196253076 - TRR 110, NSFC Grant No. 12070131001) as well as the STFC Consolidated Grant ST/T000988/1.
