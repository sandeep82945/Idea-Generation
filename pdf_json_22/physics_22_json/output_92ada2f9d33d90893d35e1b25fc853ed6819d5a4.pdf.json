Relevant to such a setup, we investigate the phase diagram of hard-core bosons in a triangular ladder with next-to nearestneighbor interaction along each leg and nearest-neighbors interactions without hopping between the legs. For weak interactions, Abelian bosonization predicts a spin density wave and a fully gapless Luttinger liquid phase. Such liquids transition to a \u2018spin-locked\u2019 cluster Luttinger liquid at strong interactions along each leg, as predicted by cluster bosonization. Interestingly, the competition with the zigzag interaction generates a charge density wave, a \u2018polarized holonic\u2019 phase, and a crystalline phase at the filling 2/5, that we address via semi-classical perturbative approach. Exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group simulations confirm the predictions and further characterize the phases and their transitions.\nIntroduction. Over the last ten years, ensembles of ground-state atoms laser-coupled to Rydberg states in optical lattices have shown outstanding aptitudes for realizing strongly interacting quantum dynamics under controlled and tunable experimental conditions [1\u20137]. For example, a weak coupling between the ground state and the Rydberg states [8\u201311] (the Rydberg-dressing) generates an effective long-range two-body interaction with a short-range plateau (the soft-shoulder potential [12]) and a power-law tail (van der Waals). The range of the plateau may reach a few microns such that probing the single-site level is easier than conventional cold atoms systems operating in Hubbard-like regimes. For a single scalar bosonic field in 1D, such an interaction induces exotic critical behaviour such as cluster Luttinger liquids (CLL) where the Luttinger theorem is inapplicable [13] and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum critical points [14]. In 2D systems, it is associated with anomalous dynamics and glassy behavior [15, 16].\nConstrained dynamics is instead relatively unexplored in mixed dimensional settings, in particular ladder systems. Such geometries are particularly interesting, as they have been recently realized in experiments [17]. In a first work along this direction, we considered square ladder lattices for dressed Rydberg atoms at filling \u03bd = 2/5, with the two legs interacting, and without inter-leg hopping [18]. Such geometry effectively couples two SUSY theories at a fine-tuned point separating a Tomonaga Luttinger liquid (TLL) and a CLL. All phases and transitions involved in the phase diagram surprisingly appear as soon as the two chains interact. Both the TLL and CLL are \u2018spin-locked\u2019 and the critical point extends into a Gaussian phase transition line, a possibly SUSY conformal transition, and a partially gapped phase in between.\nIn this work, we extend this exploration to triangular\n2 lattice geometries. Such a setting is the minimal geometry where geometric frustration, interaction clustering, and kinetic dynamics can compete. Our main result is the phase diagram of the system that is schematically depicted in Fig. 1: it is considerably richer than - and fundamentally different from - the square lattice case. The ability to manipulate the coupling of the two SUSY conformal field theories by e.g., increasing the range of the inter-leg interaction would be useful to investigate SUSY phenomenology [19, 20]. By using a triangular ge-\nometry, we show that as soon as the range is extended, only a single, potentially SUSY, transition exists between the \u2018spin-locked\u2019 TLL and CLL. In contrast, we show the existence of three phases exclusive to strong coupling, establishing the setup as a promising platform to study commensurability in extended Hubbard models. Triangular ladder. We study a triangular ladder of spinless hard-core bosons at \u03bd = 2/5 filling (on average two filled sites for every five sites in each chain, see Fig. 1(a)). Such a filling supports clustering in the classical limit. The Hamiltonian of the system reads:\nH =\u2212 t \u2211\ni,\u2113\n( b\u2020i,\u2113bi+1,\u2113 +H.c. ) + U \u2211\ni\nni,+ni,\u2212\n+ U1 \u2211\ni\nni,+ni+1,\u2212 + V \u2211\ni,\u2113\nrC \u2211\nj=1\nni,\u2113ni+j,\u2113.\n(1)\nwhere b\u2020i,\u2113 is the creation operator for hard-core bosons on site i of chain \u2113 = \u00b1 and ni,\u2113 = b \u2020 i,\u2113bi,\u2113. t is the intra-chain hopping, U and U1 are the anisotropic nearest-neighbor inter-chain interaction amplitude, V is the intra-chain interaction amplitude of range rC \u2208 N. As there is no inter-chain tunneling, the U(1) charge of each leg is conserved separately such that the Hamiltonian Eq. (1) is U(1)\u00d7U(1) symmetric. Densities are tuned by the loading scheme. For simplicity, we take rC = 2 and U1 = U unless otherwise stated. We now briefly summarize the phase diagram at weakcoupling, that is obtained using both weak-coupling bosonization, cluster bosonization. These approaches follows closely previous works [13, 14, 18]. We thus refer to to the supplementary material [21] for the analytical details of the approach, and only present its results below. The red line (U = 0) in Fig. 1(b) corresponds to two decoupled chains [13, 14]. The phase diagram of a single chain displays a TLL for 0 < V/t \u2272 5.7, and a CLL for V/t \u2273 5.7. Both the TLL and the CLL have a central charge c = 1. They are separated by a SUSY conformal phase transition point of central charge c = 3/2 at V/t \u2243 5.7 identified numerically [14].\nBy adding the interaction (U) between two of these chains, we obtain the rest of the phase diagram as shown in Fig. 1(b). We map the leg index to a SU(2) spin-1/2 degree of freedom to use the Hubbard model formalism and vocabulary [12, 22, 23].

(Color online.) (a) The scaling of the entanglement entropy S\u03c7 with the correlation length \u03be\u03c7 according to Eq. (2) for different phase transitions. We have tracked the transitions by fixing U/t = 1 (for SDW \u2194 CLL), U/t = 3.5 (for SDW \u2194 CDW), U/t = 4.5 (for CDW \u2194 CC), and varying V/t (see Ref. [18]). (b) The variations of the entanglement entropy S\u03c7 across the CDW \u2194 CLL transition for different bond dimensions \u03c7. The sudden jumps in S\u03c7 suggest the the transition to be first order.\nand V/t \u2272 0.34, we find a polarized holonic (PH) phase.\nTo identify and characterize the (gapless) phases and phase transitions, we compute the central charges c of each by evaluating how S\u03c7 scales with \u03be\u03c7 using [37\u201339]:\nS\u03c7 = c\n6 ln \u03be\u03c7 + b\n\u2032, (2)\nwhere b\u2032 is a non-universal constant. We thereby extract c = 1 for the CLL, SDW, and CDW phases, while c = 2 for the 2TLL phase. We refer to the supplementary material [21] for both the associated scalings of entanglement entropy and correlation functions characterizing these phases by their leading instabilities.\nMoreover, following the method used in Refs. [18, 32], we identify the c = 3/2 SDW \u2194 CLL, Gaussian c = 2 SDW \u2194 CDW, and the c = 1 CDW \u2194 CC phase transitions (see Fig. 3(a)). We expect the BKT phase transition between the SDW and the 2TLL phases by analogy with the square case. The sudden discontinuities in S\u03c7 seen in Fig. 3(b) indicate that the direct CDW \u2194 CLL transition is of the first order type.\nAs the iDMRG simulations do not converge properly in the PH phase due to frustrations originating from strong repulsive interaction in the triangular geometry, we cannot characterize the PH phase or the PH \u2194 CC and PH \u2194 CDW phase transitions from the iDMRG results. Therefore, to characterize both the PH and the CC phases, we use a semi-classical strong-coupling approach, completed by exact diagonalization when possible.\nWe note that the 2TLL \u2194 CDW transition is too narrow to be well studied numerically. It is also too deep in the intermediate interaction regime to be approached by perturbative techniques, hence the dotted lines in Fig. 1 (b).\nStrong intra-chain coupling. To provide analytical predictions for the large U regime, we use a perturbative strong coupling approach where t/U is the perturbation. Semi-classically in the limit U \u2192 \u221e, both the geometry and the strong intra-chain interaction segment the ladder into polarized domains. Each domain sees one leg of the ladder hosting atoms while the opposite leg is empty. States displaying such domains as in Fig. 4(a) and (b) generate the effective Hilbert space at strong-coupling. The filled leg of the ladder within a domain may host (quasi-)holes, that we call polarized holons: these holons freely propagate within the domain, and may hop from one domain to the next at no energy cost. The density of such holons fh and the density of domain walls fw is fixed by the filling \u03bd, such that\nfw + 2fh = 2\u2212 4\u03bd, (3a)\n0 \u2264 fw \u2264 Min(2\u03bd, 2\u2212 4\u03bd). (3b)\nWhen V/t is negligible, configurations that maximize the density of holons and minimize the number of domains are favored energetically as the holons can delocalize both within and beyond a domain. It is the polarized holonic (PH) liquid. Instead, for larger V , small but numerous domains (i.e., clusters in that case) are energetically favored. Deprived of the propagating holons, the system is fully gapped. We denote this regime as the cluster crystal. When V \u2a7e 2U , the strong U coupling approach breaks down.\nTo derive these results, we first obtain the perturbative Hamiltonian at second order in perturbation in t2/U with V = 0. Restricted to the effective Hilbert space of the strong coupling, the perturbative Hamiltonian is\nH|res = t\nL \u2211\ni=1\n\u2211\n\u2113\n(b\u2020i,\u2113bi+1,\u2113 +H.c.)\n\u2212 2t2\nU\n\u2211\ni\n(ni,+ni+2,\u2212 + ni,\u2212ni+1,+) .\n(4)\nIn this Hilbert space, the first term of Eq. (4) corresponds to the hopping of one particle two sites further along the zigzag if there are immediately at least three consecutive empty sites in the direction of the hopping (see Fig. 4(a)). These three consecutive holes constitute the holon. When a holon is immediately followed by other holons (its cohort), each of these extra holons adds two holes along the zigzag. In this formulation, the first term of Eq. (4) simply describes the hopping of free holons. The second term of Eq. (4) is a chemical potential for succession of exactly two empty sites. The polarization of the ladder changes across such a structure: it is a domain wall. A domain wall can also accompany a cohort of consecutive holons, each of them adding two holes along the zigzag. By convention, we consider that the domain wall is always at the left of the cohort.\n4 (a)\n(b) (c)\nw/ w\\\nt h\nh h\nFIG. 4. (Color online.)

The ladder is divided into polarized segments (here, only two with periodic boundary conditions). These segments are separated by domain walls (in red). Holes in the segments are holons (in yellow). Holons can belong to the cohort of a domain wall, like for the left domain wall on the picture. Arrow: example of hopping. (b) The cartoon picture of the CC phase. (c) One semi-classical configuration of the CLL phase.\nTo rewrite the effective model in terms of holons and domain walls, we require a creation and annihilation operator for both the holons (h\u2020i and hi) and the domain walls (w\u2020i and wi). It is possible to derive the explicit expression for both the densities of holons (nhi) and domain walls (nwi) (see [21]). The existence of these densities implies the existence of the associated creation and annihilation operators. Using these operators, we define the basis of the effective Hilbert space such that\nh\u2020i |0i\u27e9 = |1i\u27e9, hi|1i\u27e9 = |0i\u27e9, (5a) h\u2020i |1i\u27e9 = 0, hi|0i\u27e9 = 0, (5b) w\u2020i |Xi\u27e9 = |wiXi\u27e9, wi|wiXi\u27e9 = |Xi\u27e9, (5c)\nwith X = 0 or 1, and {hi, h \u2020 i} = {wi, w \u2020 i } = 1. For simplicity, we assume that the holonic and domain walls operators commute, essentially treating them as decoupled degrees of freedom. Such approximation is justified a posteriori, by comparing our findings to numerics. Using these operators, we obtain a phenomenological expression for the perturbative Hamiltonian from which we deduce an estimate of the energy levels as a function of the average density of domain walls and holon. The Hamiltonian is\nH|res\u223c t\nL \u2211\ni=1\n[\nw\u2020ih \u2020 i+1wi+1hi + h \u2020 iw \u2020 i+1hi+1wi\n+h\u2020ihi+1 (1\u2212 nw,i+1) + h \u2020 i+1hi (1\u2212 nw,i+2)\n]\n\u2212 2t2\nU\n\u2211\ni\nw\u2020iwihih \u2020 i .\n(6)\nIn Eq. (6), the first four terms describe the hopping of holons depending on the proximity of a wall. When no wall is nearby, the hopping holon is unimpeded. When a holon hops across a wall, the holon and wall exchange places. The last term in Eq. (6) counts the number of walls without cohort. As a consequence, a wall effectively\nmoves only through scattering with a holon. All walls hop one site when a holon propagates along the entire ladder. Due to this difference in scale of the two momenta, we work under the assumption that the two variables are independent to estimate the spectrum of the Hamiltonian. We take \u27e8nhi\u27e9 = fhL and \u27e8nwi\u27e9 = fwL. We find\n\u27e8H|res\u27e9/2tL = t\nU fw(fh \u2212 1)\u2212\n1 \u03c0 (1\u2212 fw) sin(\u03c0fh)\n\u2212 2\n\u03c02 sin(\u03c0fh) sin(\u03c0fw/2).\n(7)\nEq. (7) highlights competition between holons and domain walls. When U/t > 2\u03c0/(5 sin(\u03c0/5)) \u223c 2.14, the phase is the polarized holonic liquid with c = 1. Such a small value of U/t is beyond the validity of the strongcoupling approach which explains the difference with the value of \u223c 3.1 observed in Fig. 2. Third order corrections in U/t and higher allow the transformation of two domain walls of small domains into one holon and vice-versa. Similarly, we obtain the contribution of the shoulder potential to the estimated energy levels using the holons and domain walls reformulation. We find (see [21])\n\u27e8HShoulder\u27e9/V L =\n2\u2212 4fh \u2212 4fw + 2f 2 h \u2212\n1\n\u03c02 sin2(\u03c0fh)\n\u2212 1\n2\u03c02 sin(\u03c0fh) sin(2\u03c0fh) + 4fhfw +\n1 2 f2w.\n(8)\nThe full estimate of the energy levels is the sum of Eqs. (7) and (8). Because of Eq. (3a), the maximal domain wall density is twice the maximal holon density, such that Eq. (8) unilaterally favours the domain walls over the holons. A transition thus occurs when the contribution of Eq. (8) dominates over the contribution from Eq. (7). When U \u2192 \u221e, this transition is predicted at V/t \u223c 0.33 and observed at V/t \u223c 0.34 on Fig. 2. Higher order corrections effectively introduce a repulsion between domain walls. When the density of domain walls is maximized, a pattern spontaneously breaking the translation symmetry emerges, and the system goes into the CC phase. By comparing the energy of semi-classical configuration of the CC pattern as in Fig. 4(b) ECC = 2V and of a CLL state minimizing U as in Fig. 4 (c) (not included in the restricted Hilbert space) ECLL = V + 2U when t = 0, we predict the end of the CC phase at V = 2U . Due to the existence of the CDW phase (CDW are not included in the restricted Hilbert space), the transition occurs at smaller V < 2U for finite U . We extract the order parameter OCC associated with the CC phase using the structure factor:\nS(q, k) = 1\nL2\n\u2211\nj,j\u2032\n\u2211\n\u2113,\u2113\u2032\n\u27e8nj,\u2113nj\u2032,\u2113\u2032\u27e9e \u2212i(q+k(\u2113\u2212\u2113\u2032))(j\u2212j\u2032). (9)\nIn the CC phase at \u03bd = 2/5, S(q, k) displays a sharp peak at momenta q = 2\u03c0/5, k = 2\u03c0/5 (see Fig. 5(a)). Sub-\ntracting the disconnected contribution from S(q, k), we define the order parameter OCC = S(2\u03c0/5, 2\u03c0/5)\u2212 4/25 of the CC phase. Figs. 5(b) and (c) show the variation of the order parameter along the CC \u2194 PH and the CC \u2194 CDW phase transitions respectively. The sharp changes in OCC across the CC \u2194 PH transition, even for small system-size as L = 10, strongly hint that this transition might be first order in nature.\nConclusions. We have determined the phase diagram of a triangular ladder of hardcore bosons at \u03bd = 2/5 filling with next-to nearest neighbor longitudinal interaction and no transversal hopping. The model is inspired by experimental setups using Rydberg atoms loaded in an optical lattice [17], where most of the regimes we propose are in principle accessible. Similar physics shall be accessible in dressed regimes in tweezers [40]. The tunneling between the chains can be crucially suppressed by leveraging on the comparatively large quadratic Zeeman shifts from chain to chain. Alternatively, one can use a high potential barrier between the chains.\nWe have seen that the extension of the range of the inter-leg interaction immediately redesigns the vicinity of the supersymmetric point with respect to the square ladder case. In particular, a single phase transition line, likely to be a supersymmetric one, separates the weak and strong intra-chain interacting regimes at weak interchain interaction. The extra range only deforms the neighboring SDW and spin-locked CLL instead. Such results illustrate the difficulty in controlling the coupling between two supersymmetric field theories like in the square case as power-law tails always exist in realistic systems. Instead, the CLL phenomenology is robust to the inter-leg interaction range extension.\nThe strong coupling limit is also richer in the triangular geometry: a CDW appears at intermediate U/t, and the PH and gapped translation symmetry breaking CC emerge at large U/t, compared to the square case. The gapless PH is qualitatively unchanged by varying the range of the interaction or the filling. Instead, the CC disappears as soon as the filling (2/5 here) is changed or\nthe interaction range is further extended akin to gapped phases in half-filled Hubbard models. We thus expect a plethora of other CC patterns for other ranges of V and matching commensurate filling, separated at incommensurate filling by both standard and cluster Luttinger liquid phases. The phenomenology of the extended Hubbard model at any filling and at strong coupling is thus more complex than the sole clusterization of the degrees of freedom but involves instead the coexistence of phases with both clustered and Luttinger bosonic excitations separated by uncommon (e.g., supersymmetric) phase transitions.\nAcknowledgments.

EFFECT OF THE TRIANGULAR INTERACTION ON THE SUPERSYMMETRIC CRITICAL POINT\nUsing the infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) [1\u20138] techniques mentioned in the main text, we study the phase diagram in the vicinity of the supersymmetric (SUSY) c = 3 critical point at V/t \u223c 5.7 and U = U1 = 0 as U1 is tuned from 0 (square geometry) to U . We observe that as soon as U1 > 0 (U1 = U/10 in our simulation), the Charge Density Wave (CDW) phase existing in the square geometry [9] vanishes (see Fig. 1). Along with the phase, the c = 2 Gaussian phase transition existing between the Spin Density Wave (SDW) and the CDW vanishes as well. We interpret this result as the non-zero triangular term being relevant for these parameters, preventing the phase transition and deforming the SDW phase into the SDW(\u03b1) (see Sec. II).\nWhile no Gaussian transition appears in our simulation, a more detailed study in its vicinity shows that a remnant of it still exists (see Fig. 2). Such observation is compatible with a spin gap reaching a local finite minimum corresponding to both a correlation length \u03be\u03c7 and entanglement entropy S\u03c7 reaching a local maximum. The absence of a sharp peak (present for the transition in the square case, see Ref. [9]) confirms the absence of the transition.\nThe c = 3/2 phase transition between the spin-locked Cluster Luttinger Liquid (CLL) and the SDW phases remains. The phenomenological understanding of this phase transition as the sign inversion of the mass of an effective Majorana field existing at the SUSY point for the square geometry [9] holds as well for the triangular geometry.\nII. WEAK COUPLING APPROACH\nUsing the Abelian bosonization [10, 11] method we study the phase diagram of the triangular ladder model in the weak coupling regime. Specifically, after reformulating the description of the system in terms of fermions using a Jordan-Wigner transformation, we take the continuous limit of the discrete model, and linearize it around the Fermi points. To the obtained chiral Dirac fermions, we then apply the standard Abelian bosonization relations to finally derive the sine-Gordon model of two compact bosons. Using a conformal renormalization scheme at first loop, we deduce the asymptotes of the renormalization group equations depending on the initial conditions. We therefore obtain the outline of the phase diagram at weak coupling. By computing correlation functions associated to each asymptote, we identify each phase of this diagram. Using this approach, we predict the gapless 2TLL and the SDWz\u03b1 phases separated by a BKT phase transition.\nWe perform a Jordan-Wigner transformation to use fermionic degrees of freedom and notions associated with Hubbard-like models:\nbi,\u2113 = ( \u03b4\u2113,+e i\u03c0 \u2211i\u22121 j=1 nj,+ci,+ + \u03b4\u2113,\u2212e i\u03c0 \u2211N k=1 nk,+ei\u03c0 \u2211i\u22121 j=1 nj,\u2212ci,\u2212 ) , (S.1)\nwhere bi,\u2113 is the hard-core bosonic annihilation operator on site i and leg \u2113 = \u00b1. The fermionic annihilation operators ci,\u2113 obey the standard anti-commutation relations. The particle number operators are ni,\u2113 = c \u2020 i,\u2113ci,\u2113 = b \u2020 i,\u2113bi,\u2113. After the transformation, the triangular ladder Hamiltonian Eq. (1) is unchanged:\nH = H0 +HU +HU1 +HV , (S.2)\nwith\nH0 = \u2212t \u2211\n\u2113=\u00b1\n\u2211\ni\n( c\u2020i,\u2113ci+1,\u2113 + h.c. ) , (S.3a)\nHU = U \u2211\ni\nni,+ni,\u2212, (S.3b)\nHU1 = U1 \u2211\ni\nni,+ni+1,\u2212, (S.3c)\nHV = V \u2211\n\u2113=\u00b1\nrc \u2211\nr=1\nni,\u2113ni+r,\u2113, (S.3d)\nwhere we take rC = 2 unless otherwise specified.\nWe then linearize the model Eq. (S.2) around the Fermi points (at momentum \u00b1kF ) in the weak coupling regime after taking the continuum limit by introducing the right- and left-moving Dirac fermion fields\nci,\u2113 \u223c \u03c8R,\u2113(x = i) + \u03c8L,\u2113(x = i), (S.4a)\n\u03c8r,\u2113 = 1\u221a 2\u03c0a0 Ur,\u2113e irkF xei\n\u221a \u03c0 2 (r\u03d5c\u2212\u03b8c+\u2113(r\u03d5s\u2212\u03b8s)). (S.4b)\n\u03c8r,\u2113 is the associated right (r = R) and left (r = L) moving fermionic field in the continuous limit close to the Fermi points, a0 = 1 is the lattice spacing, Ur,\u2113 are the Klein factors such that {Ur,\u2113, Ur\u2032,\u2113\u2032} = 2\u03b4r,r\u2032\u03b4\u2113,\u2113\u2032 , and kF = \u03c0\u03bd/a0 is the Fermi momentum with \u03bd = 2/5 being the filling factor for each chain. The bosonic fields \u03d5c, \u03d5s, \u03b8c, and \u03b8s are the charge and spin fields and their respective dual fields.

(S.8d)\nBased on the zeroth loop approach, the cosine perturbation in Eq. (S.6c) is irrelevant as soon as Ks > 1 (i.e. g\u2225 < 0). In this regime the spin gap nonetheless opens because of the first-loop corrections to the renormalization group equations [10]\ndg\u2225 dl = 1 2\u03c0 g20 ,\ndg0 dl = 1 2\u03c0 g0g\u2225,\nd\u03b1 dl = 0, (S.9)\nwhich predict a BKT phase transition from gapless 2LL to SDWz(\u03b1) with a spin-gap, when g\u2225 > \u2212|g0|. In other words, the zero-th loop predicts the 2TLL \u2194 SDW transition at V = 5U/2, whereas the first loop renormalization predicts the transition at V = 4\u22122 \u221a 4\u2212 \u221a 5\n10 U . Such a result means that the characterization of each phase should be sharp above and below both predicted transition line, but more arduous in between as the partial gap is weaker. Such a phenomena explains why the detection of the BKT phase transition is more difficult in numerical simulations. We draw the V = 5U/2 line on the phase diagram as it is below this line that a simulation likely mistakenly confuses the SDW for the 2TLL. In the SDWz(\u03b1) phase the spin field is fixed at \u03d5s(\u03b1) =\n\u03b1\u221a 8\u03c0 + \u221a \u03c0 8 modulo\n(\u221a\n\u03c0 8\n)\nby the spin gap. The corresponding\norder parameter is\nO\u03b1 = sin (\u221a 2\u03c0\u03d5s \u2212 \u03b1/2 ) , (S.10a)\n= Otriplet0 cos(\u03b1/2)\u2212Osinglet sin(\u03b1/2), (S.10b)\n4 with \u03b1 \u2208 [0; 2\u03c0/5] as U1/U \u2208 [0;\u221e) and where Otriplet0 is the \u201ctriplet 0\u201d and Osinglet is the singlet order parameter [12]. When \u03b1 = 0 (U1 = 0), this order parameter corresponds to the contribution of the spin sector to the 2kF spin-densitywave operator\nOzSDW = Sz(x)\u2212 1\u221a 2\u03c0 \u2202x\u03d5s(x)\n= cos (\u221a 2\u03c0\u03d5c + 2kFx ) sin (\u221a 2\u03c0\u03d5s ) ,\n(S.11)\nwhere Sz(x) the continuous limit of the spin operator\n1\n2\n\u2211 \u2113,\u2113\u2032=\u00b1 c\u2020x,\u2113\u03c3 z \u2113\u2113\u2032cx,\u2113\u2032 \u223c Sz(x), (S.12)\nwith \u03c3z\u2113\u2113\u2032 the Pauli matrix along the z-direction. The associated correlation function in SDW z(\u03b1) phase is\n\u27e8OzSDW(x)OzSDW(y)\u27e9 \u223c sin2 (\u221a 2\u03c0\u03d5s(\u03b1) ) cos(2kF |x\u2212 y|)|x\u2212 y|\u2212Kc , (S.13)\nwhich is also the correlator with the longest range, such that the SDWz(\u03b1) is the dominant instability in the system. In 2TLL phase, both 2kF momentum CDWs and SDWs instabilities are in competition. The order parameter associated with CDW is defined as\nOCDW = \u03c1(x)\u2212 \u221a 2\n\u03c0 \u2202x\u03d5c(x), (S.14)\nwhere \u03c1(x) is the continuous limit of the density operator\n\u2211 \u2113=\u00b1 c\u2020x,\u2113cx,\u2113 \u223c \u03c1(x).

CLUSTER BOSONIZATION APPROACH\nThe low-energy effective theory of a single chain (U = U1 = 0) at strong coupling V \u226b t is effectively described by cluster bosonic fields, i.e. density fluctuations of perfect cluster configuration of particles. To derive this result, we use the Cluster bosonization approach. In the continuum limit, the bosonic field operators are expressed as [9, 13]\n\u03c8\u2113 (x) = e \u2212 i\n\u221a \u03c0 \u03c3 \u03b8 \u2032 \u2113(x)\n\u221a\n\u03bd \u2212 1\u221a \u03c0\u03c3\n\u2207\u03d5\u2032\u2113(x) +\u221e \u2211\nq=\u2212\u221e \u03b1q,\u2113e\n\u2212i2q(\u03c0x\u03bd\u03c3\u2212\u221a\u03c0\u03d5\u2032\u2113(x)) (S.17)\nand the particle density operator as\n\u03c1\u2113(x) =\n(\n\u03bd \u2212 1\u221a \u03c0\u03c3\n\u2207\u03d5\u2032\u2113(x) ) +\u221e \u2211\nq=\u2212\u221e Aq,\u2113e\n\u2212i2q(\u03c0x\u03c3\u03bd\u2212\u221a\u03c0\u03d5\u2032\u2113(x)). (S.18)\n\u03d5\u2032\u2113(x) is the fluctuation above a perfect cluster configuration on chain \u2113. \u03b8 \u2032 \u2113(x) is defined as the conjuguate variable of \u2207\u03d5\u2032\u2113(x) such that [\n\u03b8\u2032\u2113(y), 1 \u03c0 \u2207\u03d5\u2032\u2113\u2032(x)\n]\n= i\u03b4\u2113,\u2113\u2032\u03b4(x\u2212 y). (S.19)\n5 Aq,\u2113 = A \u2217 \u2212q,\u2113 and \u03b1q,\u2113 are the non-universal constants that strongly depend on the microscopic details of the system. \u03c3 =M/N with M and N being the number of clusters and particles respectively. In the absence of the inter-chain interactions U and U1, we have two decoupled chains with the soft-shoulder interaction V acting within each chain. Using the cluster bosonization, the Hamiltonian of each chain is mapped to the Hamiltonian of free massless cluster bosons [13, 14]\nHV,t \u223c \u2211\n\u2113=\u00b1\nv\n2\n\u222b\ndx ( (\u2207\u03c6\u2032\u2113)2/K +K(\u2207\u03b8\u2032\u2113)2 ) , (S.20)\nwhere K is the cluster-Luttinger parameter. Since the top and bottom chains are identical, we have K+ = K\u2212 = K and v+ = v\u2212 = v. By dropping the constants and only keeping the most relevant terms, the mapping for the U interaction is [9]\nHU \u223c U \u222b dx\u03c1+(x)\u03c1\u2212(x),\n\u2248 g(0)U \u222b dx\u2207\u03c6\u2032+(x)\u2207\u03c6\u2032\u2212(x) + g (1) U \u222b dx cos (\u221a 4\u03c0[\u03c6\u2032+(x)\u2212 \u03c6\u2032\u2212(x)] ) ,\n(S.21)\nwith g (0) U = U |A0|2 \u03c0\u03c32 and g (1) U = 2\u03bd 2U |A1|2.

(S.23c)\nUsing the spin and charge cluster bosonic fields\n\u03c6\u2032\u2113 = \u03c6\u2032c + \u2113\u03c6 \u2032 s\u221a\n2 , \u03b8\u2032\u2113 =\n\u03b8\u2032c + \u2113\u03b8 \u2032 s\u221a\n2 , (S.24)\nwith \u2113 = \u00b1, the total hamiltonian for the triangular ladder H = HV,t +HU +HU1 is\nH = vc 2\n\u222b\ndx\n(\nKc(\u2207\u03b8\u2032c)2 + 1 Kc (\u2207\u03c6\u2032c)2\n)\n+ vs 2\n\u222b\ndx\n(\nKs(\u2207\u03b8\u2032s)2 + 1 Ks (\u2207\u03c6\u2032s)2\n)\n+ g\n\u222b dx cos (\u221a 8\u03c0\u03c6\u2032s \u2212 \u03b1 ) , (S.25)\nwith\ng =\n\u221a\n(\ng (1) U + g (1) U1\n)2\n+ (\ng (2) U1\n)2\n, \u03b1 = arctan\n(\n\u2212g(2)U1 g (1) U + g (1) U1\n)\n, (S.26a)\nKc = K \u221a\n1 +\n(\ng (1) U +g (1) U1\n)\nK\nv\n, vc = v\n\u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a\n1 +\n(\ng (1) U + g (1) U1\n)\nK\nv , (S.26b)\nKs = K \u221a\n1\u2212 ( g (1) U +g (1) U1 ) K\nv\n, vs = v\n\u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a\n1\u2212\n(\ng (1) U + g (1) U1\n)\nK\nv . (S.26c)\nAs the effective cluster Hamiltonian Eq. (S.25) is formally similar to the bosonized Hamiltonian Eq. (S.6), we conclude that two phases are possible (g > 0). If the spin mass is irrelevant, then one possible phase is a CLL with c = 2. If instead the mass is relevant, then the second possible phase is a \u2019spin-locked\u2019 CLL with c = 1. The microscopic details of the coarse-graining realized with the Cluster bosonization are hidden within the A\u2113,q and \u03b1\u2113,q coefficients, preventing their estimations. In consequence, the relevancy of the mass is only accessible by the numerical simulations. The simulations we perform show that c = 1 and therefore that the mass is relevant.\nIV. NUMERICAL RESULTS ON THE PHASES AT WEAK AND INTERMEDIATE INTER-CHAIN COUPLING STRENGTHS\nBy the means of iDMRG simulations, we now numerically analyze different phases that appear at weak and intermediate inter-chain coupling (U/t) strengths, i.e., the 2TLL, the SDW, the CDW, and the CLL phases. To this end, we first extract the central charge c for these phases by fitting the bond dimension \u03c7-dependent entanglement entropy S\u03c7 as a function of the \u03c7-dependent correlation length \u03be\u03c7 using the following relation[15\u201317]:\nS\u03c7 = c\n6 ln \u03be\u03c7 + b\n\u2032, (S.27)\nwhere b\u2032 is a non-universal constant. In Fig. 3, we plot the scaling of S\u03c7 with respect to \u03be\u03c7 in these phases as we increase the bond dimension from \u03c7 = 64 to 1280. Clearly, all these phases, except the 2TLL, have central charge c = 1 indicating gapped spin-sectors while the charge-sectors remain gapless as in the case for square geometry [9]. In the 2TLL phase, c = 2 signifies that the both sectors are gapless. We characterize each phases with c = 1 phases by analyzing correlation functions of the form\nCO(R) = \u27e8OjOj+R\u27e9 \u2212 \u27e8Oj\u27e9\u27e8Oj+R\u27e9, (S.28)\nwhere Oj is a local operator. When the distance R is greater than the correlation length \u03be\u03c7 all correlations trivially decay exponentially, restricting the validity of the computed correlation function to R \u2248 \u03be\u03c7 at maximum.\nInstead of considering the spin correlation function CSz (where Szj = (nj,+ \u2212 nj,\u2212)/2) and the charge correlation function Cn (where nj = (nj,+ + nj,\u2212)), we find that the bond-spin correlation CBS and the bond-charge correlation CBC are more suitable to characterize the SDW and the CDW phases. Within each of the pairs (CSz , CBS ) and (Cn, CBC ), the correlation are largely indistinguishable in theory when the charge sector is not gapped [12]. The bond operators are defined as\nBSj = ( (b\u2020j,+bj+1,+ +H.c.)\u2212 (b \u2020 j,\u2212bj+1,\u2212 +H.c.) ) /2, (S.29a)\nBCj = ( b\u2020j,+bj+1,+ + b \u2020 j,\u2212bj+1,\u2212 +H.c. ) . (S.29b)\nFigs. 4(a)-(b) show these bond correlation functions in the SDW and the CDW phases for R \u2264 200 < \u03be\u03c7=2048. Clearly, in the SDW phase, the bond-spin correlation function CBS follows power-law and the bond-charge correlation\n7 10 20 50 100 200\nR\n10 \u22126\n10 \u22125\n10 \u22124\n10 \u22123\n10 \u22122\n|C B\nS |\n(a)\nSDW, U/t = 2, V/t = 2 CDW, U/t = 4, V/t = 1.8\n10 20 50 100 200\nR\n10 \u22125\n10 \u22124\n10 \u22123\n10 \u22122\n|C B\nC |\n(b)\nSDW, U/t = 2, V/t = 2 CDW, U/t = 4, V/t = 1.8\n40 60 80 100 R\n\u22120.0020 \u22120.0015 \u22120.0010 \u22120.0005 0.0000 0.0005 0.0010 0.0015 0.0020 C B S (c) Frequency 2kF SDW, U/t = 2, V/t = 2\n40 60 80 100 R\n\u22120.010 \u22120.008 \u22120.006 \u22120.004 \u22120.002 0.000 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008 0.010 C B C\n(d)\nFrequency 2kF CDW, U/t = 4, V/t = 1.8\nFIG. 4.

The subplots (b) and (d) depict the Fourier transform of the spin correlation and charge correlation functions respectively.\nCBC decays exponentially with the distance R. The opposite is observed in the CDW phase. The frequencies of the oscillations in the algebraically decaying correlations can be obtained by fitting the the data to the following formula:\nC(R) \u223c cos (kR)R\u2212\u03b2 . (S.30)\nFigs. 4(c)-(d) show such fits for the bond-spin and the bond-charge correlations respectively in the SDW and CDW phases. In both the cases, the numerical fits show that the frequency of oscillations are k = 2kF = 2\u03c0/5 as expected from the analysis of Sec. II.\nIn the case of the CLL phase, since the leading instabilities are clustered, we look at the spin correlation CSz and charge correlation Cn functions. Fig. 5 shows the evolution of these correlation functions with respect to the distance R together with their Fourier transform. As expected in the CLL phase, both the correlation functions decay following a power-law. By analyzing the Fourier transforms, we extract the two primary frequencies of the oscillations as k = 2kF = 4\u03c0/5 and k = 3kF /2 = 3\u03c0/5. k = 3kF /2 is the cluster Fourier momentum appearing in\n8 Eq. (S.18) that translates the specific cluster instability of the Luttinger liquid. Like in the square ladder [9], we interpret the other major frequencies such as k = 2kF as due to the pollution of the signal by subdominant SDW or CDW instabilities. Interestingly and unlike the square geometry, these frequencies are present in both spin and charge correlation functions, translating the deformation due to the added range of U .\nV. STRONG U COUPLING THEORY IN THE TRIANGULAR LADDER.\nWe present here the details of the semi-classical approach to the holonic polarized and the cluster crystal phases.\nA. Densities of holons and domain walls\nIt is possible to get formulae for both the domain walls and holon densities. Because holons can form cohorts, these densities are non-local operators preventing the formulae from being easily used. To obtain them, we define the projectors:\nPi\u2212 = ni\u2212(1\u2212 ni+), (S.31a) Pi+ = ni+(1\u2212 ni+1+), (S.31b) Mi\u2212 = (1\u2212 ni\u2212)(1\u2212 ni+), (S.31c) Mi+ = (1\u2212 ni+)(1\u2212 ni+1\u2212), (S.31d) Di\u2212 = (1\u2212 ni\u2212)ni+, (S.31e) Di+ = (1\u2212 ni+)ni+1\u2212. (S.31f)\nUsing Eqs. (S.31), we define the quasi-local projector Pi and the total projector P onto the effective Hilbert space of strong U coupling as\nPi = (Mi\u22121+ +Di\u22121+ + Pi\u22121+)(Mi+ +Di+ + Pi+)\u2212 Pi\u22121+Pi+, (S.32a) P = \u2297iPi. (S.32b)\nUsing Eqs. (S.31), we obtain the density of domain walls by summing over the projectors on one domain wall state\nfor all cohorts. We note w / i (resp. w \\ i ) a domain wall with its first empty site on rung i and separating a domain with the leg + populated on the left (resp. right) and the leg \u2212 populated on the right (resp. left). Their respective density operator are\nn / wi = Pi\u22121+Di+ + Pi\u22121+Mi+Di+1+ + . . .\n= Pi\u22121+\n(\nDi+ +\nL\u22124 \u2211\nk=0\nMi+Mi+1+ . . .Mi+k+Di+k+1+\n)\n, (S.33a)\nn \\ wi = Pi\u2212Di+1\u2212 + Pi\u2212Mi+1\u2212Di+2\u2212 + . . .\n= Pi\u2212\n( Di+1\u2212 + L\u22125 \u2211\nk=0\nMi+1\u2212Mi+2\u2212 . . .Mi+k+1\u2212Di+k+2\u2212\n)\n, (S.33b)\nfor periodic boundary conditions.

When the holon belongs to the cohort of a domain wall, there is an ambiguity in these definition. This ambiguity explains the factor 1/2 (chosen conventionally). This ambiguity is lifted when defining holons independently of the leg (as it should) e.g. for nh,i = nhi+ + nhi\u2212 when the holon belongs to the cohort of a domain wall \\ or no cohort of a domain wall and nh,i = nhi\u22121+ + nhi\u2212 otherwise. The holon density is then\nnhi =\n\u221e \u2211\nk=0\nk \u2211\nl=0\nPi\u22121\u2212l+\nl \u220f\nm=1\nMi\u2212m+(1\u2212 ni+) k\u2212l \u220f\nr=1\nMi+r\u2212Di+(k\u2212l)+1\u2212\n+\n\u221e \u2211\nk=0\nk \u2211\nl=0\nPi\u22121\u2212l\u2212\nl \u220f\nm=1\nMi\u2212m+(1\u2212 ni\u2212) k\u2212l \u220f\nr=1\nMi+r\u22121+Di+(k\u2212l)+\n+\n\u221e \u2211\nk=0\nk \u2211\nl=0\nPi\u22121\u2212l+\nk \u220f\nm=0\nMi\u2212l+m+Di+(k\u2212l)+1+ + \u221e \u2211\nk=0\nk \u2211\nl=0\nPi\u22122\u2212l\u2212\nk \u220f\nm=0\nMi\u2212l+m\u22121\u2212Di+(k\u2212l)\u2212.\n(S.36)\nFrom the densities Eqs. (S.33) and (S.36), we deduce the existence of the (non-local) creation and annihilation operator for both holons (h\u2020i and hi) and domain walls (w \u2020 i and wi).\nB. Estimation of the energy level\nWe rewrite the perturbative Hamiltonian Eq. (4) using h\u2020i , hi, w \u2020 i , and wi to estimate the energy levels as a function\nof the average densities fh and fw. The perturbative Hamiltonian is\nH = t L \u2211\ni=1\n[\nh\u2020ihi+1 ( 1\u2212 nw\\,i ) + h\u2020iw \\\u2020 i+1hi+1w \\ i + h \u2020 ihi+1 ( 1\u2212 nw/,i+1 ) + h\u2020iw /\u2020 i+2hi+2w / i+1\n+h\u2020i+1hi ( 1\u2212 nw\\,i+1 ) + w \\\u2020 i h \u2020 i+1w \\ i+1hi + h \u2020 i+1hi ( 1\u2212 nw/,i+2 ) + w /\u2020 i+1h \u2020 i+2w / i+2hi\n]\n\u2212 2t 2\nU\n\u2211\ni\n[ nw\\,i(1\u2212 nh,i+1) + nw/,i(1\u2212 nh,i+1) ] ,\n(S.37)\nleading to the phenomenological Eq. (6) when simplifying the details concerning the range that have no influence on the estimation. For simplicity, we consider holons independent from domain walls to obtain an effective Hamiltonian\n10\nfor each by averaging over the holons or the domain walls separately. We have\nHh \u2243 |\u03b1| L \u2211\ni=1\n( ei\u03b8h\u2020ihi+1 +H.c. )\n+ \u03b2 \u2211\ni\n(nh,i \u2212 1), (S.38a)\nHw \u2243 |\u03b3| L \u2211\ni=1\n( ei\u03d5w\u2020iwi+1 +H.c. )\n+ \u03b4 \u2211\ni\nnw,i + 2tLRe(\u03b3),\n(S.38b)\nwith\n\u03b1 = t ( \u27e81\u2212 nw,i+1\u27e9+ \u27e8w\u2020i+1wi\u27e9 ) ,\n= |\u03b1|ei\u03b8, (S.39a)\n\u03b2 = 2t2\nU \u27e8nw,i\u27e9, (S.39b)\n\u03b3 = t\u27e8h\u2020i+1hi\u27e9, = |\u03b3|ei\u03d5,\n(S.39c)\n\u03b4 = \u2212t ( \u27e8h\u2020i\u22121hi\u22122\u27e9+ \u27e8h \u2020 i\u22121hi\u27e9 )\n\u2212 2t 2\nU \u27e81\u2212 nh,i\u27e9.\n(S.39d)\nBy diagonalizing the Hamiltonian Eqs. (S.38) and building the eigenstates as a product state of holonic and domain wall mode, we get the hopping averages (e.g. \u27e8w\u2020i+1wi\u27e9) such that\n\u03b1 = t (1\u2212 fs) + 2t L ei(\u03d5\u2212\u03c0\u2212 \u03c0 L )\nsin ( \u03c0 2 fw )\nsin ( \u03c0 L\n) , (S.40a)\n\u03b2 = 2t2fw U , (S.40b) \u03b3 = t\nL ei(\u03b8\u2212\u03c0\u2212 \u03c0 L )\nsin(\u03c0fh)\nsin ( \u03c0 L\n) , (S.40c)\n\u03b4 = \u22122t L cos ( \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 L ) sin(\u03c0fh) sin (\n\u03c0 L\n)\n\u2212 2t 2\nU (1\u2212 fh) ,\n(S.40d)\n\u03d5 = \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0/L [2\u03c0], (S.40e)\ntan(\u03b8) = sin ( \u03b8 \u2212 2\u03c0L )\ncos ( \u03b8 \u2212 2\u03c0L ) + L sin(\u03c0/L)sin(\u03c0fw) (1\u2212 fw) . (S.40f)\nEqs. (S.40e) and (S.40f) always (only) admit \u03b8 = \u03d5+ \u03c0 = 0 [2\u03c0] as a solution when L\u2192 \u221e. We then obtain Eq. (7) by averaging Eq. (6) over both holons and domain walls successively and using Eqs. (S.40) in the limit L\u2192 \u221e.\nC. Phenomenological shoulder potential\nWe provide the expression of the shoulder potential and its contribution to the estimate of the energy level for rc = 3. The method is identical to Sec. VB, but must be carried term by term. It is diagonal in the basis of domain walls and holons so there are no higher order corrections in V .
