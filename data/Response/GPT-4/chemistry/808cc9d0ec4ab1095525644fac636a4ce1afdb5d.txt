Enhancement of Biogenic Thiosulfate Stability: Future research could explore strategies to enhance the stability of biogenic thiosulfate, aiming to prevent its degradation over time. This might involve investigating alternative buffering systems, the addition of stabilizing agents, or modifications to the bioreactor design to extend the shelf life of biogenic thiosulfate for industrial applications.

Expansion to Other Platinum Group Metals (PGMs): While this study focused on palladium (Pd), expanding the research to include other PGMs such as platinum (Pt), rhodium (Rh), and others could be valuable. This would involve assessing the efficiency of the biogenic thiosulfate leaching process on these metals and optimizing conditions specific to each metal's recovery.

Integration with Other Bioleaching Technologies: Investigating the integration of biogenic thiosulfate production with other bioleaching or biomining technologies could open new pathways for the eco-friendly extraction of valuable metals. For instance, coupling biogenic thiosulfate production with microbial consortia that specialize in metal solubilization could enhance the efficiency and selectivity of PGM recovery.

Scale-Up Studies for Commercial Application: Conducting scale-up studies to evaluate the feasibility of applying the biogenic thiosulfate leaching process on an industrial scale would be crucial for its commercialization. This includes the design and operation of pilot-scale bioreactors, process optimization for large-scale operations, and economic assessments to evaluate cost-effectiveness compared to traditional methods.

Environmental Impact and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA): A comprehensive LCA study to quantify the environmental benefits and impacts of the biogenic thiosulfate leaching process compared to conventional PGM recovery methods would be valuable. This research could include assessments of greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, water usage, and potential ecological impacts, providing a holistic view of the sustainability of the process.
