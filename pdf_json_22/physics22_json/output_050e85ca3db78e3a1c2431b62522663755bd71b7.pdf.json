Using the \u2019t Hooft wave functions, we construct the reduced density matrix for an interval in the momentum fraction x space, and calculate its von Neumann entropy in terms of structure functions, that are measured by deep inelastic scattering on mesons (hadrons in general). We found that the entropy is bounded by an area law with logarithmic divergences, proportional to the rapidity of the meson. The evolution of the entanglement entropy with rapidity is fixed by the cumulative singlet parton distribution function (PDF), and bounded from above by a Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of 1. At low x, the entanglement exhibits an asymptotic expansion, similar to the forward meson-meson scattering amplitude in the Regge limit. The evolution of the entanglement entropy in parton x per unit rapidity measures the meson singlet PDF. The resummed entanglement entropy along the single meson Regge trajectory is stringlike. We suggest that its extension to multimeson states models deep inelastic scattering on a large 2D\u201cnucleus.\u201d The result is a large rate of change of the entanglement entropy with rapidity, that matches the current Bekenstein-Bremermann bound for maximum quantum information flow. This mechanism may be at the origin of the large entropy deposition and rapid thermalization, reported in current heavy ion colliders, and may extend to future electron-ion colliders.",

INTRODUCTION\nQuantum entanglement permeates most of our quantum description of physical laws. It follows from the fact that quantum states are mostly superposition states, and two noncausally related measurements can be correlated, as captured by the famed Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen paradox. A quantitative measure of this correlation is given by the quantum entanglement entropy. The entanglement entropy of quantum many-body system and quantum field theory\nhas been extensively explored in the literature [1\u20135]. Less known perhaps is the concept of quantum entanglement flow and its relation to quantum information flow and storage. A maximum flow is expected in the most ideal quantum systems, following from the bound in energy change imposed by the uncertainty principle [6,7]. In hadron physics, quantum entanglement is inherent to a hadron undergoing large longitudinal boosts, with its wave function described either by wee partons [8] or string bits [9\u201311]. Entanglement entropies are currently measured in diffractive pp scattering at large ffiffi s p in current collider facilities [12\u201314], and will be measured in ep scattering at low x at future eIC facilities [12\u201315], with better accuracy. Entanglement entropies in relation to hadronic processes have also been discussed in [16,17]. In ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, these inherently large entanglement entropies are at the origin of the prompt flow of wee entropy, likely at the boundary of our quantum laws. They may also explain the almost instantaneous *yizhuang.liu@uj.edu.pl \u2020maciej.a.nowak@uj.edu.pl \u2021ismail.zahed@stonybrook.edu Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

The duality between the low-x partons and the string bits [13,19,20] explains why their entanglement provides for the most efficient mechanism for scrambling information, matching only that produced by gravitational black holes [9,10]. In this work we discuss entanglement in longitudinal partonic momentum or Bjorken-x space, and also in rapidity space or ln 1x using two-dimensional QCD. In the large number of colors limit, 2D QCD is solvable with a dual partonic [21] and stringlike description [22]. The purpose of this work is to elucidate the concept of entanglement in single hadron states, or along a fixed Regge trajectory, as probed with deep inelastic scattering (DIS) kinematics. As an example of DIS scattering on a 2D nucleus, we will address the entanglement in a multimeson state (recall that all hadrons are similar on the light front), and show how its growth rate in rapidity saturates the current bound on quantum information flow. The outline of the paper is as follows: In Sec. II we briefly review the light cone formulation of 2D QCD with Dirac quarks. In the large number of color limit, the twobody sector decouples and solves the \u2019t Hooft equation [21]. In Sec. III, we detail the entangled density matrix in a single meson state, with a single parton-x cut, as probed by DIS scattering. The evolution of the entanglement entropy with rapidity is fixed by the cumulative parton distribution function (PDF), obeys a Kolmogorov-Sinai bound of 1 [23] (and references therein), and reduces to the longitudinal meson structure function at low x. The entanglement entropy is shown to be universal in the 2D scaling limit. In Sec. IV we recast 2D QCD as a string on the light front in the 2-particle sector. We show that the entanglement of the string bits follows by resumming over the one meson Regge trajectory, thanks to duality. We suggest that the resummation over multimeson Regge trajectories may describe DIS scattering on a 2D nucleus on the light front. The evolution of the ensuing entanglement entropy with rapidity is extensive in the classical and longitudinal string entropy.

How to choose A depends on the probe experiment of interest. For instance, when probing a hadron in a DIS experiment via hard scattering, the virtual photon selects a quark or antiquark with fixed parton-x, say x0 < 1 2 in the range A\u0304 \u00bc \u00bd0; x0 . The DIS event traces the hadron density matrix over the remaining and unobserved longitudinal momentum range A \u00bc \u00bdx0; 1 . This is particularly clear, when probing a hadron using semi-inclusive DIS production of heavy mesons. In the large Nc or planar approximation, the process is dominated by Reggeon exchange, with the measured parton x, kinematically limited to small x0 \u226a 1. This reduction of the density matrix is asymmetric in parton x. A more symmetric but rather academic reduction is discussed in Appendix B. With this in mind, we now perform the partial trace in the\ntensor product in Eq. (14), over all the Hx and H\u0304x where x > x0 with x0 < 1 2 . To carry out the partial trace, it is clear that for x < x0 and x0 < x0, we are left with the quark contribution\n1 \u039b\u2212 X x<x0 j\u03c6n\u00f0x\u00dej2a\u2020xj0ixh0jxax \u2297 y<x0;y0<x0;y\u2260x j0iyj0\u0304iy0 h0\u0304jy0 h0jy:\n\u00f021\u00de\nSimilarly, for x > 1 \u2212 x0 and x0 > 1 \u2212 x0, we have the antiquark contribution\n1 \u039b\u2212 X x<x0 j\u03c6n\u00f0x\u0304\u00dej2b\u2020xj0\u0304ixh0\u0304jxbx \u2297 y<x0;y0<x0;y0\u2260x j0iyj0\u0304iy0 h0\u0304jy0 h0jy:\n\u00f022\u00de\nIt is easy to see that in the cases where x < x0; x0 > 1 \u2212 x0 or x > 1 \u2212 x0; x0 < x0, there are no partial traces that can be formed since in both of these two cases there will be one quark below x0 and another quark above x0. The case x0 < x < 1 \u2212 x0 and x0 < x0 < 1 \u2212 x0 should be considered, since in this case both the quark and antiquark are above x0, and should be traced out.

The bound (31) can be understood in the following way. For the \u2019t Hooft wave functions, the reduced density matrix contains only one-body and zero-body (vacuum) terms; therefore, its Schmidt decomposition allows at most 2x0\u039b\u2212 terms, which implies an upper-bound Sn \u2264 ln\u039b\u2212 \u00fe ln 2x0.

            "text": "In the large number of colors, the 2-particle sector of 2D QCD on the light front decouples. The eigenmodes in this sector have a dual description in terms of partons or string modes. We have shown that in the partonic language, the entanglement in longitudinal momentum is captured by an exact reduced density matrix that is a tensor product of both the valence and vacuum states. The entanglement entropy for a single meson with a single cut in parton x, as probed by DIS kinematics, is a nonlinear function of the meson PDF. For fixed parton x, the evolution in rapidity of the single meson entanglement entropy is the cumulative quark single PDF. It is bound by a Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of 1. At low parton x, it reduces to the longitudinal structure function, as measured in DIS scattering. It is in agreement with the Regge behavior of the pertinent meson-meson scattering in 2D QCD. Alternatively, for fixed rapidity, the evolution in parton x is shown to probe directly the meson singlet PDF. The sum total of the entanglement entropies for a fixed Regge trajectory is stringlike and extensive with the rapidity, as noted in 4D. We have suggested that DIS scattering on a nucleus in 2D can be modeled by DIS scattering on a multihadron state composed of 2D mesons, modulo Fermi statistics (amusingly shared by mesons\nthrough longitudinal space exclusion for Nc \u00bc 1). The evolution in rapidity of the ensuing entanglement entropy is found to be extensive in the longitudinal string entropy in 2D. The rate of change of this entropy matches the maximum rate of quantum information flow, as given by the Bekenstein-Bremermann bound. A highly boosted multimeson state in 2D (a sort of 2D nucleus as all hadrons are similar on the light front) exhibits a growth rate in its wee parton entanglement entropy, that is only matched by the largest information rate flow allowed by the quantum laws of physics, a fit only exhibited by gravitational black holes. Remarkably, this flow exhibits an energy cost which is fixed by the Hagedorn temperature of the underlying longitudinal string. The highly entangled wee partons in a boosted string as a mock nucleus carry an entanglement entropy that is commensurate with the classical string entropy SS. Their prompt release by smashing, in current colliders at large rapidities \u03c7 \u00bc ln s, may explain why a large quantum entanglement entropy of about \u03c7SS is promptly released, over a short time scale 1=lS, and at temperatures in (slight) excess of the Hagedorn temperature TH \u00bc 1=\u00f02\u03c0lS\u00de. Finally, we note that the t\u2019Hooft model is subcritical in terms of rapidity evolution, with no increase in parton densities for a large rapidity gap. In particular, the linear growth of the entanglement entropy noted here should hold for any general QFT, with subcritical parton evolution in rapidity. In 4D gauge theories with nontrivial parton evolution in rapidity, there are qualitative changes in the evolution of the entanglement in rapidity, and its corresponding entropy [37]."
