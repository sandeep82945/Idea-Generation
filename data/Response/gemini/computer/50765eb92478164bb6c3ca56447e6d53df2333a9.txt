It could also involve developing and implementing programs that connect women with role models and mentors in the entrepreneurial ecosystem.


3. **Examine the impact of different pedagogical approaches on women's participation in EEPs and their entrepreneurial self-efficacy.** This could involve comparing the effectiveness of different pedagogical approaches, such as project-based learning, experiential learning, and collaborative learning, in engaging women in EEPs and developing their entrepreneurial self-efficacy. It could also involve developing and implementing pedagogical approaches that are specifically designed to address the needs of women in EEPs.


4. **Investigate the impact of EEPs on women's entrepreneurial intent and venture creation.** This could involve examining the relationship between participation in EEPs and women's entrepreneurial intent and venture creation. It could also involve identifying the factors that influence women's entrepreneurial intent and venture creation, and developing programs and interventions that are designed to increase women's entrepreneurial intent and venture creation.


5. **Explore the role of EEPs in promoting diversity and inclusion in the entrepreneurial ecosystem.** This could involve examining the impact of EEPs on the participation of women and other underrepresented groups in entrepreneurship.
