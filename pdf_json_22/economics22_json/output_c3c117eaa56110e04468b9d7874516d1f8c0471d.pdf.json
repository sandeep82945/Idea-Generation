The quality of decisions rests heavily on the accuracy of people\u2019s forecasting of future emotions (Greene et\u00a0al., 2016; Lench et\u00a0al., 2019). Unfortunately, a large body of research has indicated that anticipated emotions and actually experienced emotions are often inconsistent, and this bias (inaccuracy) can also have important implications for subsequent decisions, resulting in complex human decision-making behaviors (Hoerger et\u00a0al., 2016; Levine et\u00a0al., 2018). While research has discussed the impact of affective forecasting and the effect the anticipated emotions it generates on decision making, the prevalence and role of affective forecasting bias in social decision making, especially allocation decision making, has not received sufficient attention and needs to be\u00a0further explored.\nIn the following sections, we\u00a0reviewed the affective forecasting bias research and used the feelings-as-information model to explore the effect of affective forecasting bias on allocation decisions. Study 1 tested whether affective prediction bias is present in resource allocation, and study 2 examined whether and when affective forecasting bias influences subsequent allocation decisions. This study makes contributions to the existent literature in three folds. First, it provides experimental evidence for the prevalence and role of affective forecasting bias in allocation decision making and enriches academic knowledge and understanding of this concept; Second, it provides a new emotional perspective\u2014affective forecasting bias\u2014in understanding and studying individuals\u2019 resource allocation decisions; Third, it extends previous findings concerning the feelings-as-information model to resource allocation. Finally, the limitations of this study and directions for future research are discussed.\nAffective forecasting bias and decision making\nPeople always forecast what their future emotional responses will be\u00a0to both positive and negative events when making a decision (Wilson and Gilbert, 2003, 2013; Buechel et\u00a0al., 2014). That is, people are involved in affective forecasting (Wilson and Gilbert, 2003). The outcome of the forecasting is anticipated emotion, which is the \u2018cognitive\u2019 and future-oriented emotion experienced when anticipating a future outcome (Baumgartner et\u00a0al., 2008).\nIn the past decades, a substantial body of research has addressed the question of how well people predict their affective reactions to future events. Research has shown that people often correctly predict the valence of their emotional responses and the specific emotions they will experience, but they are not very good at correctly predicting their initial intensity of the responses and the duration of emotion (for reviews, see Wilson and Gilbert, 2003). People anticipate feeling worse after negative events and better after positive events than they actually experience when the events occur (e.g., Wilson et al., 2000; Gilbert et\u00a0al., 2004). This tendency to overestimate the intensity of future emotion has been\ntermed impact bias (Wilson and Gilbert, 2003; Dillard et\u00a0 al., 2021). For instance, Buehler and Mcfarland (2001) have confirmed this basic forecasting bias in five experimental studies in which participants overestimated the intensity of their affective reactions across a wide variety of life events (e.g., trips and vacations, major purchases, family visits, academic failures, dental appointments). Other studies have also shown that when people predicted they would fail to receive tenure (Gilbert et\u00a0 al., 1998), break up (Eastwick et\u00a0 al., 2008), participate in a talent show (Feys and Anseel, 2015), win or lose games (Lau et\u00a0al., 2016), engage in passive activities (Schiffer and Roberts, 2018), be\u00a0 exposed to opposing views (Dorison et\u00a0 al., 2019), or participate in policymaking (Cohen-Blankshtain and Sulitzeanu-Kenan, 2021), they tended to expect stronger affective reactions than they actually experienced. To explore this phenomenon further, scholars have operationally defined affective forecasting bias as the difference between anticipated and experienced affect (Patrick et\u00a0al., 2007; Lau et\u00a0al., 2016).\nResearch has shown that affective forecasting bias plays a complicated role in decision-making (Levine et\u00a0al., 2018). Bias in affective forecasting may prove costly and lead to inappropriate decisions. For instance, Wilson and Gilbert (2005) found that couples decided to break up due to the false prediction that staying in the relationship would bring greater emotional harm. People were also less likely to ask for genetic test results if they expected to be\u00a0distressed by them (Ferrer et\u00a0al., 2015). In another study, women who expected to experience greater stress were more likely to refuse medications after they received advice to take them to reduce their high risk of breast cancer (Hoerger et\u00a0 al., 2016). Rehabilitation experts overestimated the intensity and duration of a physical injury, a bias that could result in unfair court judgments granting more compensation than necessary (Greene et\u00a0al., 2016). However, affective forecasting bias may also serve a functional purpose. Affective forecasters may strategically overestimate the hedonic impact of events to motivate themselves to produce the events that they forecast (Morewedge and Buechel, 2013).\nAffective forecasting bias and allocation decisions\nIn everyday life, people are often involved in the allocation of limited resources (e.g., money or time) between themselves and others, which is referred to as allocative decision making (Rilling and Sanfey, 2011; van der Schalk et\u00a0al., 2015). As an essential type of social decision-making, allocative decisions involve psychological conflicts between self-interest and the interests of others and may reflect either prosocial or selfish preferences (van Dijk and De Dreu, 2021). Decisions about resource allocation are important, for example, when deciding how to allocate salary raises from a fixed pool or health care resources among patients with different needs (Rilling and Sanfey, 2011; Argyris et\u00a0al., 2022). Furthermore, these allocation decisions are essential for individual social interaction, interpersonal relationships, and well-being, and\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\ntherefore have an important place in decision-making (Rilling and Sanfey, 2011). In this study, we\u00a0 extend affective forecasting research by examining the degree of forecasting accuracy of individuals\u2019 future emotional responses to allocation decisions.\nResearch has shown that observers\u2019 anticipated emotions influence their resource allocations and that people may tend to make allocation decisions based on affective forecasting (van der Schalk et\u00a0al., 2015). When making decisions, they often imagine how they might feel about the consequences of the allocation and use their anticipated emotions to guide their choices (Nelissen et\u00a0al., 2011; van der Schalk et\u00a0al., 2012, 2015). Bargaining offers in ultimatum game experiments are guided by the emotions that proposers anticipate when considering their offers, and findings suggest that both anticipated fear and anticipated guilt can increase proposers\u2019 ultimatum offers (Nelissen et\u00a0al., 2011). Van der Schalk et\u00a0 al. (2012) have found that when participants expected to be\u00a0proud of their fair allocation, they bid more to anonymous others, and when they expected to regret their fair allocation, they bid less to anonymous others. There is an implied assumption in these studies that people are accurate in their anticipated emotions, but this has not been found to be\u00a0the case (Wilson and Gilbert, 2003; Patrick et\u00a0al., 2007; Lau et\u00a0al., 2016). Affective forecasting bias may also be\u00a0prevalent and an important influencing factor on the decision-making process in allocation decisions. Previous studies have not included affective forecasting bias as a key research variable to be\u00a0examined.\nIn summary, affective forecasting plays an important role in decision making, as does affective forecasting bias. The affective forecasting bias can result in individuals making inappropriate decisions, but it may also confer some benefit. The effect of affective forecasting bias on decision-making may vary in different contexts. As an important type of social decision-making, allocative decisions are associated with prosocial or selfish preferences and important for individual social interaction, interpersonal relationships, and well-being. Unfortunately, whether affective forecasting bias leads individuals to be\u00a0more or less generous when allocating limited resources has received little research attention. As a result, in this paper, we\u00a0extended affective forecasting research by examining the degree of forecasting accuracy of individuals\u2019 future emotional responses to allocation decisions and its effect.\nThe ultimatum game has been used in most social interaction studies (G\u00fcth and Kocher, 2014; Tisserand et\u00a0al., 2015). The game is developed by G\u00fcth et\u00a0 al. (1982) and has two players anonymously dividing a certain amount of money. The allocator first offers a proportion of the money to the recipient, and the recipient chooses to accept or refuse the offer. If the recipient accepts the offer, the money is distributed according to the allocator\u2019s offer. On the other hand, if the responder refuses the offer, neither receives any money. The ultimatum game, therefore, models decisions about resource allocation on the part of the allocator (Rilling and Sanfey, 2011; van der Schalk et\u00a0al., 2015). Thus, the ultimatum game on the part of the proposer is very suitable for studying resource allocation decisions."

The allocator decides how to distribute the money, and the recipient can accept or reject this distribution. If the recipient accepts the allocation, then they will get the money according to this distribution, and if the recipient rejects it, neither of them gets any money. The ultimatum game, therefore, models decisions about resource allocation on the part of the allocator. Thus, in this study, all participants were allocators. In addition, according to the classical experimental paradigm of affective forecasting bias, generally, researchers consider both positive and negative outcomes (Buehler and 2001; Pauketat et\u00a0 al., 2016). The recipients were not arranged in order to manipulate the results of the recipients, i.e., half of the participants accepted the allocator\u2019s offer, and half of the participants rejected the allocator\u2019s offer, thus generating both positive and negative event conditions.\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org"

The participants first filled in the basic information, including their gender, age, and initial emotion. Participants were then informed that they would be\u00a0paired with one of the other participants who were at the same time in another room of the laboratory and play an allocation game on the computer. They were told they were assigned as an allocator or recipient based on a chance procedure. After providing consent, the experimenter explained to the participants in detail how to play the ultimatum game, with the following specific instructions: \u201cYou will complete this experiment with a student from another room. In this experiment, you\u00a0will jointly allocate $100. You, as the allocator, will choose one of nine allocation options (allocate \u00a510, \u00a520, \u00a530, \u00a540, \u00a550, \u00a560, \u00a570, \u00a580, \u00a590) to the other student. The other student, as the recipient, will decide whether to accept or reject the allocation option. For example, if you\u00a0allocate \u00a510 to the other student, the other student will receive \u00a510, and you\u00a0will receive \u00a590. And so on. If the recipient accepts the option, the two of you\u00a0 will distribute the money according to this option. If the recipient rejects the option, neither of you\u00a0will receive the money. At the end of the experiment, you\u00a0will be\u00a0paid the appropriate percentage based on your distribution in the experiment.\u201d In this experiment, all participants were allocators; That is, there was no another recipient in the other room.\nNext, participants played the ultimatum game. Whatever the allocator offers, we\u00a0hypothesize that if his offer is rejected, he\u00a0does not get a penny, which is a negative event for him. If the other student accepts his offer, he\u00a0gets the corresponding amount of money, which is a positive event for him. We\u00a0test this hypothesis in a pilot study. The results indicated that offer acceptance could induce positive emotions and rejection could induce negative emotions (see Table\u00a0 1). We\u00a0 could thus safely consider the rejection of their offer to be\u00a0a negative event and the acceptance of their offer to be\u00a0a positive event. Forty-two participants were randomly assigned to a positive event condition (recipients\naccepted the allocation) and 44 participants were randomly assigned to a negative event condition (recipients rejected the allocation)."

In study 2, we\u00a0examined the relationship between this biased affective forecasting and subsequent resource allocation decisions in the same ultimatum game.\nStudy 2\nThe purpose of study 2 was to examine the effect of the affective forecasting bias on subsequent allocation decision making. As study 1 showed, in the positive event condition, the affective forecasting bias showed that the intensity of anticipated positive emotions was higher than the actually experienced one, resulting in feeling worse than forecasted. In the negative event condition, the affective forecasting bias also showed that the intensity of anticipated negative emotions was higher than the experienced one, resulting in feeling better than forecasted.\nThe feelings-as-information model proposes that in order to make decisions, people ask themselves \u201chow do I\u00a0feel about it?.\u201d\nTABLE\u00a02 Descriptive statistics and t-test for anticipated and experienced emotions.\nAnticipated emotion\nExperienced emotion\nAffective forecasting bias\nn (M\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD) (M\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD) t p Cohen\u2019s d\nStudy 1\nPositive event 42 7.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0(0.92) 6.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0(1.04) 0.70 4.17 0.000 0.64\nNegative event 42 6.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0(1.25) 5.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0(1.46) 0.51 2.19 0.034 0.34\nStudy 2\nPositive event 96 6.94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0(1.09) 6.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0(1.63) 0.60 4.64 0.000 0.47\nNegative event 96 6.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0(1.80) 5.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0(1.86) 0.49 4.01 0.000 0.41\nd\u00a0= 0.2 (small effect); d\u00a0= 0.5 (medium effect): d\u00a0= 0.8 (large effect).\nFrontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin.org\nThis model asserts that positive feelings inform a safe and benign environment that does not require careful detailed processing, and that individuals rely on heuristic, top-down process. In contrast, negative feelings suggest the presence of a problem, thus triggering more careful, detailed, and bottom-up processing and attempts to resolve the perceived problem (Clore and Huntsinger, 2007; Huntsinger et\u00a0 al., 2014). Although feeling better/worse than forecasted is not the same as positive/negative feelings, evidence for the proposed effect would extend research by suggesting that like positive/negative feelings, feeling better/ worse than forecasted may also be\u00a0 attention getting, have an impact on information processing, and have greater informative value on decision-making (Pham, 2004). Moreover, the principle of \u2018ecological rationality\u2019 in decision making emphasizes the importance of individual adaptation to the environment, and sees decision making as the process of using information about the environment to achieve valuable outcomes (Gigerenzer, 1998). We\u00a0expected that people with forecasting bias would lead people to propose less generous offers in the positive event condition, and more generous offers in the negative event condition."

It demonstrates that when there is an affective forecasting bias in positive event conditions, the larger the affective forecasting bias, the less generous the decisions will be. When there is an affective forecasting bias in negative event conditions, the larger the affective forecasting bias, the more generous the decisions will be. These results extend previous findings concerning the feelings-as-information model to resource allocation and suggest that affective forecasting bias can likewise assign positive or negative values to available mental content and influence the use of different decision processing strategies in allocation decisions (Clore and Huntsinger, 2007; Huntsinger et\u00a0al., 2014).\nAffective forecasting bias may not necessarily lead to inappropriate decisions, but rather to different effects depending on the valence of the event. In terms of ecological rationality, affective forecasting bias in positive event conditions indicates that the experienced emotion is worse than the anticipated emotion, so individuals protect themselves by being less generous. The changed feeling indicates a decrease in emotional utility, thus individuals compensate for the outcome utility to achieve psychological balance. However, their increased uncooperative behavior will weaken their social interaction effectiveness. In negative event conditions, affective forecasting bias means the experienced emotion is better than the anticipated emotion, resulting in an increase in emotional utility that leads people to ignore monetary losses. These effects suggest that affective forecasting bias has some evolutionary adaptive implications (Gigerenzer, 1998; Dunn et\u00a0al., 2007; Feys and Anseel, 2015).\nThe research implications above point to the fact that the way in which affective forecasts are managed in resource allocation depends on the context. In the present study, when under positive event conditions, the affective forecasting bias had a negative impact on the generosity in allocation decisions, which would undermine the effectiveness of social interaction. In this case, people\u2019s optimistic\nbiases may not be\u00a0reasonable (Patrick et\u00a0al., 2007; van Tilburg and Igou, 2019). However, when under negative event conditions, the affective forecasting bias implies overly dire negative forecasts of their future. As noted previously, people\u2019s decisions are often guided by their anticipated affective reactions to future events. Such overly negative forecasts may undermine individuals\u2019 motivation (Levine et\u00a0al., 2018). Unrealistic positive expectations about positive events and overly dire negative forecasts about negative events may be\u00a0a detrimental factor in people\u2019s emotional well-being and life quality (Buehler and Mcfarland, 2001; Peters et\u00a0al., 2014). Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that being more cautious in forecasting positive outcomes and more optimistic in forecasting negative outcomes can be\u00a0beneficial to one\u2019s well-being.\nThis article focuses on the relationship between affective forecasting bias and allocation decision-making, which has certain theoretical and practical implications, but there are still research limitations. The study only discusses the influence of affective prediction bias on allocation decisions, and does not address the issue of the influence mechanism. There may be\u00a0some important mediating mechanisms between affective forecasting bias and allocation decisions. For example, in the positive event condition, the increase in affective forecasting bias may lead to a relative sense of loss that makes individuals to pay more attention to their personal feelings and make less generous decisions (Martinez et\u00a0al., 2011; Palermo, 2017). This affective forecasting bias may also stimulate a sense of helplessness and apprehension, such that individuals may appear internally focused and egocentric, leading them to focus more on their own interests, and behave less generously (Van Kleef et\u00a0al., 2006). While in the negative event condition, the increase in affective forecasting bias may lead to a relative feeling of elation that compensates for the material loss (van der Schalk et\u00a0al., 2012) and makes individuals pay more attention to the feelings of others and make more altruistic decisions (Lane, 2017). Those good feelings may also cause individuals to adopt a holistic processing strategy that is more considerate of the feelings and interests of others (Huntsinger et\u00a0al., 2014). Future research should empirically explore these hypothesized mechanisms.\nFurthermore, the contingency factors that moderate the relationship between affective forecasting bias and allocation\nTABLE\u00a04 Descriptive statistics and correlations between variables in the negative situation.\nM SD 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n1.

Some studies have found that the effect of emotion on decision-making varies according to individual differences. For example, individual interpersonal orientation moderates the relationship between emotion and gift-giving decisions (Hooge, 2017). In addition to the individual differences\u2019 factors, motivational factors may also play a moderating role in affective forecasting and allocation decisions (Buehler et\u00a0al., 2007; Christophe and Hansenne, 2016; Pauketat et\u00a0al., 2016). The moderating role of time may also need to be\u00a0tested. The extant research has indicated that coping mechanisms in psychological immune system may help proposers reconcile the bias of forecasting (Gilbert et\u00a0al., 1998). We\u00a0might expect, for instance, that the psychological immune system would diminish the impact of forecasting bias on allocation decisions over time, as it allows proposers to reconstruct their affective forecasts and experiences. Identifying the conditions that moderate the relationship between affective forecasting and allocation decisions is also an important future research direction."

            "text": "Although the ability to forecast the future is one of the most prominent human abilities (Gilbert and Wilson, 2007; Miloyan and Suddendorf, 2015), not all forecasts are accurate (Wilson and Gilbert, 2003). Therefore, studying affective forecasting bias is as critical as studying affective forecasting itself. The present study demonstrated that affective forecasting bias affects allocation decisions differently in positive and negative event conditions, and helps people better understand the effect of affective forecasting on decision making. The specific findings are as follows: (1) there is an affective forecasting bias in allocation decisions, where people anticipate more powerful emotional reactions to both positive and negative allocation events than they actually experience when the events occur. (2) The increased affective forecasting bias results in less generous decisions in positive event conditions and more generous decisions in negative event conditions."
