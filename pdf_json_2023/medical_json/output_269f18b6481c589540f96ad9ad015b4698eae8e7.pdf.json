However, any organ system could be affected during disease progression [1-3]. Renal involvement is the most common at 18-77 %, Central Nervous System (CNS) involvement was 1-8 %, and Otitis Media was up to 25-44% % in GPA patients [4]. A recent case report has revealed an association between Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST) and Hypertrophic Pachymeningitis (HP) in patients with Proteinase 3 anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-ANCA) positive GPA [5]. There is a clear relationship between CVST and Hyperhomocysteinemia [6]. A few studies have reported deep venous thrombosis (DVT) as venous involvement in GPA [7]."

            "text": "Published literature describes HP and CVST in GPA as having fibrosing inflammation involving the dura mater, which encases the sinuses, resulting in progressive occlusion [5]. Few studies have shown that Hyperhomocysteinemia was associated with CVST in 52% of patients and was mostly due to dietary deficiency of Vitamin B12 and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) mutation. If the link between Hyperhomocysteinemia and vitamin B12 deficiency in CVST is confirmed, it may supply a basis for preventing CVST in patients [6]. Venous involvement is not common in GPA; if patients complain of pain in their lower limbs, DVT should be ruled out [7]. Some studies provide the first true evidence of an increased risk of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) and an increased risk of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) in patients with GPA compared to the general population [8]. In a recent study, CNS involvement was related to frequent neurological sequelae in patients of GPA [9]. The presentation of Wegener's granulomatosis can vary, and patients may initially present with isolated cranial neuritis. Physicians should be aware of this disease's atypical and uncommon presentations, which may help in early diagnosis and initiation of treatment [10]."

At this point, it can only be hypothesized that Hyperhomocysteinemia and etiopathogenesis of GPA have a direct relation, as no other cases have been reported yet. Also, further research is needed to study the relationship between the same."
