The researchers constructed a mediated regulation model to examine the effects of intrusive rumination on the creativity of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the mediating effect of post-traumatic growth and the moderating role of psychological resilience.\nMethods: A sample of 475 university students from Guangdong Province, China, were surveyed with the Runco Ideational Behavior Scale, the Event Related Rumination Inventory, the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, and the Psychological Resilience Scale. SPSS (version 23) and PROCESS (version 3.3) were used for correlation analysis, mediation analysis, and mediated moderation analysis.\nResults: (1) Intrusive rumination was positively correlated with post-traumatic growth and creativity but negatively correlated with psychological resilience. Psychological resilience was positively correlated with post-traumatic growth and creativity. Posttraumatic growth and creativity were positively correlated. (2) Post-traumatic growth played a mediating role in the relationship between intrusive rumination and creativity.

            "text": "The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is the most widespread public health emergency to hit humanity in nearly a century. It has spread on an unprecedented scale among more than 150 countries worldwide (American Psychological Association [APA], 2020; Liu Y. et al., 2020). The rapid emergence, transmission and infection of COVID-19 have not only overwhelmed the global public health and social systems, but also influenced the mental health of people around the world. The governments have taken extreme public health measures in response to it (Xiao et al., 2020; Government of Canada, 2021). While interrupting the spread of the pandemic, however, these measures have had a negative impact on the national social structure and economic activities (Nicola et al., 2020). Restrictive measures such as isolation have affected people\u2019s psychological well-being while producing dramatic changes in their thoughts, psychological responses and emotional reactions to the pandemic (Brooks et al., 2020). COVID-19 is regarded as a traumatic event in a number of studies related to public health and mental health (Castelli et al., 2020; Fawaz and Samaha, 2020; Forte et al., 2020).\nRecent studies have shown that under the influence of the COVID-19, the public is generally more psychologically stressed and prone to negative emotions such as anxiety and depression. In China, for example, in the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak, a study showed that more than half of the participants perceived a moderate to severe psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, with about one-third of participants experiencing moderate or even severe anxiety (Wang et al., 2020). In North America, severe psychological problems gradually emerging as COVID-19 spread rapidly. The prevalence of depression and anxiety was 44.1 and 47.2%, respectively, in a Canadian study (Nwachukwu et al., 2020) and 24.4 and 28.2% in an American study (Twenge and Joiner, 2020). In addition, the COVID-19 outbreak also triggered post-traumatic stress symptoms (Jiang et al., 2020), with an Italian study (Forte et al., 2020) showing up to 29.5% of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and an Irish study (Karatzias et al., 2020) showing that 17% of adults in the general population have experienced PTSD symptoms. Students have often been susceptible to the \u201cpsychological pandemic\u201d caused by its emotional and academic stress (Kumar et al., 2019; Ahmed et al., 2020; Huang and Zhao, 2020). Studies have shown that COVID-19 has brought more serious mental-health problems to students, with a prevalence of depression of 23.8% (Chi et al., 2020) and anxiety of 24.9%, among which the proportion of severe anxiety is 90% (Talevi et al., 2020). It is worth discussing how college students in areas affected by the pandemic, who were experiencing the distress caused by COVID-19 themselves or those around them, coped with the sudden changes, adjusted to the psychological stress, and grow up in the fight against the pandemic.\nThe negative emotions that individuals experience under the influence of COVID-19 may disrupt their original selfperceptions or core beliefs, resulting in cognitive imbalance. The stress caused by this cognitive disequilibrium may promote them to develop appropriate cognitive activities. Under the stress caused by cognitive disequilibrium, certain negative effects are\ninevitable, but the positive side motivates individuals to form cognitive activities accordingly such as intrusive rumination (Zhou et al., 2015). In the past 20 years, with the rise of positive psychology, researchers have found that although individuals experience a traumatic event accompanied by a stress response, they can also make positive changes in a certain field, thereby achieving growth (Tedeschi and Calhoun, 1996). It is closely related to the process of psychological recovery after a traumatic event, when individuals can achieve positive psychological changes reflecting on their emotions and exploring the causes and consequences of a traumatic event (Dunn et al., 2011). And individuals gain positive growth after encountering an pandemic by thinking about their life environment and social environment after the pandemic (Feng et al., 2021). In this context, researchers have gradually developed a new perspective on stress and trauma research that is oriented toward positive-growth research with a focus on post-traumatic growth (Joseph and Linley, 2006). One study has found a strong link between post-traumatic growth and creativity: post-traumatic growth may lead to enhanced creativity (Liang et al., 2021). Since traumatic events may recur in an individual\u2019s life, creative people are often able to convert challenges into a source of inspiration and motivation for their work. It has also been shown that a high level of psychological resilience can mitigate negative emotional reactions to traumatic events, including COVID-19 (Liu C. H. et al., 2020) and therefore can also help overcome the negative emotional distress caused by the pandemic (Prime et al., 2020).\nCOVID-19 has had a significant impact on the mental health of college students, and creativity as a prior variable can predict individual mental health or adjustment (Wang et al., 2021). The aims of this paper are therefore to explore the relationship between intrusive rumination and creativity and the mediating role of post-traumatic growth between the two, including mental resilience in the model as a moderator. The definitions of these four variables and the relationships among them are described below."

            "text": "After experiencing a global traumatic event such as COVID19, individuals not only experience negative psychological states, but are also prompted to re-examine themselves or reconsider their beliefs, which is regarded as a process of rumination due to the repetitive nature of this cognitive process (Moberly and Watkins, 2008; Cann et al., 2011). Rumination is a cognitive response in which individuals repeatedly think about traumatic events and their consequences when experiencing such events (McEvoy et al., 2013); Nolen-Hoeksema (1991) defined ruminative thinking as he tendency of individuals to spontaneously repeat thoughts when experiencing negative stressful events, considering it a form of negative thinking about traumatic events and as a form of self-referral. On this basis, a large body of research has demonstrated that if individuals are in a ruminative state of mind, their psychological condition\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 789844\nis more susceptible to the negative effects of traumatic events (Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2017), and they are more likely to produce symptoms of depression and anxiety when exposed to negative life experiences (e.g., life challenges, being a victim of bullying) because they tend to be in a negative frame of mind (Marks et al., 2010; Garnefski and Kraaij, 2014). Other researchers have argued that ruminant thinking is the repetition of reflections on relevant events based on understanding the meaning of the event, problem solving, recalling the event, and anticipating the future, a view that reflects the positive side of ruminant thinking. Given that there is no uniform definition of ruminative thinking at this stage, this paper will adopt Cann et al.\u2019s (2011) description of ruminative thinking, which he extends to include intrusive rumination and deliberate rumination, the two dimensions of ruminative thinking, one of which is negative and unconstructive and the other positive and constructive. Intrusive rumination is a negative coping attitude: when a traumatic event passively intrudes into an individual\u2019s perception, they react with an evaluative, negative emotional state, a non-constructive perception (Cann et al., 2011). Positive rumination, as a constructive cognition, means that individuals consciously reduce the negative impact of traumatic events, actively think positively, face difficulties and actively seek solutions to problems. The widespread and rapid spread of COVID-19 has created a sense of crisis in many people, generating many negative emotions and thoughts that lead to intrusive rumination. In fact, intrusive rumination should receive more attention as an important cognitive process that is closely related to physical and mental health.\nThe development and creation of innovative persons has been a matter of international academic and educational concern. Creativity is an intellectual quality that uses all known information to produce something new, unique, and of value to society or the individual, for a certain purpose (Marks et al., 2010). American psychologist J. P. Guilford coined the term creativity, arguing that the process of creating fiction is a process of thought and action (Tedeschi and Calhoun, 1996) and emphasizing that creativity is not a special talent of genius. This led researchers to focus on the exploration of everyday creativity, and their understanding of creative personality shifted from a narrow exploration of top talent in certain fields to a broader exploration of the creative personality of ordinary people (Joseph and Linley, 2006). Creativity is a complex structure that involves both cognition and emotion (Csikszentmihalyi, 1996). Some historiometry studies have pointed out that trauma in childhood may contribute to the development of creative potential, and the frequency and intensity of trauma events can help identify areas of creative achievement.\nPrevious research has shown that certain forms of rumination contribute to the creative process (Vahle-Hinz et al., 2017). Specifically, the relationship between intrusive rumination and creativity needs to be further investigated. Some studies have shown that intrusive rumination contributes to creative processes. The reason may be that intrusive rumination allow individuals to have more consciou s faculties to attend to generating and refining a creative idea or behavior (Cohen and Ferrari, 2010). For example, Verhaeghen et al. (2005) found that\ntraumatic events, while inevitably creating negative emotions leading to intrusive rumination, can also generate creativity, and that high levels of self-reflection and rumination may contribute to creative work. Richards (1981) believed that professionals in the creative field (such as writing) tended to rumination. Intrusive rumination may allow individuals to have more consciou faculties to attend to generating and refining a creative idea or behavior (Cohen and Ferrari, 2010). Furthermore, ruminant thinking affects different professions differently, with knowledge workers being more concerned with ruminating (Krys et al., 2020). In particular, professionals in creative fields (e.g., writing) tend to ruminate (Tsai et al., 2021). Some studies have also investigated that students\u2019 creativity during an pandemic is positively associated with invasive rumination (Wang et al., 2021). Based on this argument, we propose the following hypothesis.\nH1: Intrusive rumination is positively associated with creativity."

            "text": "Research has found that in addition to symptoms of stress, individuals experiencing a traumatic event can also derive benefit and experience growth, including post-traumatic growth. Posttraumatic growth is also approached as a popularization text, and some psychologists try to establish the concept of post-traumatic growth from a theoretical or analytical depth. Tedeschi and Calhoun (1996) first introduced the concept of post-traumatic growth in their measurement of the phenomenon of positive change in the psychological aspects of individuals from traumatic events. They proposed that the concept should cover four areas:\n(a) The traumatic event was impactful. (b) In struggling with the traumatic event, the individual\nexperienced a positive process of psychological change. (c) The individual\u2019s level of functioning in at least one area was\nhigher than before the traumatic event. (d) Growth and psychological distress coexisted.\nThe concept of post-traumatic growth has prompted psychological researchers to re-examine psychological stress and trauma from a new perspective, with positive-growth research focusing on post-traumatic growth (Joseph and Linley, 2006). The rapid spread of COVID-19 around the world is similar to a deep existential crisis or traumatic experience, making people suffer from not only the existential threat brought by the pandemic but also from anxiety and panic (Emanuel et al., 2020).\nThe idea that rumination helps to change individuals\u2019 perceptions and emotions about themselves and the outside world, which can lead to post-traumatic growth, is also reflected in the literature (Cann et al., 2011; Stockton et al., 2011; Lindstrom et al., 2013). Post-traumatic growth emerges from the struggle with the traumatic event, and the cognitive component has a key role in its emergence (Tedeschi and Calhoun, 2004). The level of intrusive rumination positively predicts the level of post-traumatic growth because it is the basis of the cognitive processing that triggers post-traumatic growth and is\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 789844\na catalyst for seeking positive meaning from the traumatic event (Cohen and Ferrari, 2010). According to the above research, intrusive rumination is one of the facilitating cognitive emotional mechanisms of post-traumatic growth. Therefore, we propose a second hypothesis:\nH2a: Intrusive rumination is positively correlated with post-traumatic growth.\nTraumatic events may have different effects on individual creativity. They may cause negative emotions and have a negative impact on creativity (Benedek et al., 2014). However, other research has suggested that post-traumatic growth can help promote individual creativity development (Forgeard, 2013). For example, when studying the relationship between post-traumatic growth and personality intensity, Peterson et al. (2008) found that creativity as a cognitive level of personality intensity was significantly correlated with post-traumatic growth (r = 0.21). In the context of COVID-19, it is also worth exploring how the post-traumatic growth of college students after traumatic events affected their creativity development. Therefore, we propose a third hypothesis:\nH2b: The post-traumatic growth of college students is positively correlated with creativity.\nBased on the above hypothesis and argument, we proposea the fourth hypothesis:\nH2: Post-traumatic growth mediates the positive effects of intrusive rumination on creativity."

            "heading": "The Moderating Effect of Resilience",
            "text": "People differ in how they deal with stress and trauma, and so their responses to different types of emotional distress caused by traumatic events like the COVID-19 outbreak also vary (Killgore et al., 2020). The American Psychological Association (2016) defined resilience as \u201cthe process of adapting well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threat, or other significant adversity\u201d (p. 2). This personality trait enables individuals to withstand and overcome difficulties and adversity, and it plays an important role in overcoming the adverse effects of traumatic events (Southwick et al., 2014). In sports, for example, resilience can help athletes adapt to adverse conditions and overcome difficulties, increasing their chances of success (Hill et al., 2018). Although resilience exists within individuals and is a dynamic adaptive process that is difficult to measure, existing research has shown that individuals with higher levels of resilience achieve better mental-health outcomes (such as for depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder) in the wake of adversity and major threats (Osofsky et al., 2011). Studies of bereavement (Bonanno et al., 2002, 2005a) and of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in New York City on September 11, 2001 (Bonanno et al., 2005b) provided preliminary evidence of mental resilience in adults. In the face of the increasingly severe global COVID-19 pandemic, strengthening the resilience of the public remains a public-health priority.\nCollege students may have unconsciously engaged in intrusive rumination during COVID-19. and those with higher levels of\nresilience have been more likely to focus on and process positive information and the positive aspects of their personal experience (Hou and Ng, 2014). Intrusive rumination involves sorting out one\u2019s own emotions and exploring the meaning of the causes and consequences of negative events, which may contribute to the process of psychological recovery (Prati and Pietrantoni, 2009). However, some studies regard resilience and rumination as two inverse factors of stress disorder and used them to explore the factors that affect the recovery of people with post-traumatic stress (Blackburn and Owens, 2016). Resilience is considered as a factor that promotes recovery from stress, while rumination is seen as a negative factor that inhibits recovery. As a result, we propose a fifth hypothesis:\nH3a: Intrusive rumination is positively correlated with resilience.\nAccording to previous research, resilience and post-traumatic growth are positively correlated, and the level of psychological resilience can predict the level of post-traumatic growth (Wu et al., 2015). Psychological resilience refers to individual\u2019s positive adaptation to adversity (Luthar, 2006; Manyena, 2006), which is a kind of strategy to deal with life adversity. Individuals with high levels of resilience have higher cognitive flexibility, and they can adjust their cognition after a traumatic event so as to maintain good mental health, so as to successfully deal with traumatic events and achieve personal growth (Hooper et al., 2008). In a daily life, individuals may experience traumatic experiences such as interpersonal violence, death of a loved one, natural disasters, serious industrial or other accidents, war, or terrorism (Furr et al., 2010; Eisenberg and Silver, 2011; Dimitry, 2012; Masten and Narayan, 2012; Osofsky and Osofsky, 2013). Although such experiences are a potential risk to mental health and may lead to post-traumatic stress disorder, among others consequences, most people do not develop the such disorders because of the positive effect of resilience (Karam et al., 2014). COVID-19, as a global traumatic event, needs psychological resilience to deal with, which is related to not only the mental health of individuals during the pandemic, but also individuals getting positive results in negative experiences (Li et al., 2015). Therefore, an in-depth study of the relationship between resilience and post-traumatic growth in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic could be significant. We believe that college students with stronger psychological resilience are more likely to achieve post-traumatic growth, therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:\nH3b: Resilience is positively correlated with post-traumatic growth.\nCreativity has long been associated with resilient adaptation factors (Luthar, 2003); Metzl and Morrell (2008) integrated two pertinent concepts of resilience and creativity in a general model under one general model in which creativity, as a trait, plays a role within the conceptualization of resilience as a multifactor process. Specific aspects of creativity\u2014namely flexible thinking and originality\u2014appear most pertinent to the process of emotional resilience, and a high level resilience can help individuals maintain a good state in traumatic events, thus\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 789844\nproviding good conditions for the development of creativity (Metzl, 2009). The relationship between these two variables has been little explored; however, the studies that have reached similar conclusions (Wang et al., 2021). In summary, we propose the following hypothesis:\nH3c: Resilience is positively correlated with creativity.\nBased on the existing research and the above hypotheses, we further propose that\nH3: Resilience may moderate the effects of posttraumatic growth on the relationship between intrusive rumination and creativity."

In order to gather preliminary information before the research protocol was finalized, an exploratory focus-group interview was conducted with students convened by faculty members. To comply with public-health requirements, the focus group was conducted in an onlinemeeting format. During the meeting, most of the students indicated that they had experienced negative emotions during the COVID-19 outbreak due to various factors. College students in the pandemic areas are experiencing the problems caused by themselves or the surrounding people to Covid-19. How to deal with sudden changes, adjust their psychological stress response, and gain experience and growth in fighting the pandemic is a problem worth in-depth discussion.\nA total of 918 students participated in the study by completing an online survey. In China, QR codes are widely used because they carry large amounts of information and are easy and inexpensive to use. Therefore, data for this study were collected with the help of QR codes, mainly by showing the twodimensional code for the questionnaire during breaks in English classes of students in a certain year of their college program. Before the QR code for the questionnaire was shared, the purpose of this study was explained. After giving consent, students who volunteered to do so filled out the questionnaire. The data collection period was from April 10 to June 15, 2020.\nIn order to better study the psychological status of students in pandemic areas and to avoid invalid samples influencing the data results, the data were preprocessed before analysis. Questionnaires from students outside Guangdong province and from non-pandemic areas were removed, which reduced the sample size to 475. These remaining participants were all from students in the same year of study and comprised 156 males (36.534%) and 271 females (63.466%)."

The process of generating passive and undesired invasive ideas after a highly stressful event can be regarded as intrusive rumination, so the consistency between some items of RIBS and intrusive rumination may lead to a positive correlation between intrusive rumination and creativity. Clinical psychology researchers have studied the relationship between rumination and creativity, and there have been some interesting findings. Different forms of rumination have different mechanisms of action on creativity. Only reflective rumination can positively predict creativity, according to Burwell and Shirk (2007). However, the results of this study match those of many previous studies in which intrusive rumination is closely and positively correlated with creativity. Participating students with high levels of creativity experienced more intrusive rumination during the COVID-19 pandemic, possibly because creativity values free association or fantasy (Wang et al., 2021). Intrusive rumination allows more conscious participation in the production and refinement of a creative idea or behavior (Dijksterhuis and Meurs, 2006). In fact, the relationship between rumination and creativity may vary with the person or environment (Wang et al., 2021). Differently from previous rumination studies, for which data collection took place in a safe environment, data collection for this study occurred in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, a traumatic global event. The results of the present study may better reflect reality.\nSecond, the results confirm H2a, H2b, and H2. Intrusive rumination can positively predict post-traumatic growth. Intrusive rumination increases the negative emotion and cognitive burden of individuals. In order to alleviate the impact of these negative psychological reactions, individuals have to engage in active cognitive processing of trauma-related cues (Ciesla and Roberts, 2007). Therefore, positive interventions in college students\u2019 mental health are of great significance for their post-traumatic growth. Furthermore, post-traumatic growth promotes creativity because the experience of adversity can provide important material, ideas, and motivation for creative projects (Forgeard, 2013). After a traumatic event, it forces us to re-examine our past experiences and perceptions, break down our old worldviews, and construct new meanings and identities. For example, and scientists may seek to understand the reasons for their experience. As well, individuals who have experienced traumatic events and grown as a result can collect materials and\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 789844"

This is the \u201csurvivor mission\u201d (Eskreis-Winkler et al., 2014). Therefore, post-traumatic growth can play a mediating role between intrusive rumination and creativity; that is, intrusive rumination can further affect the development of individual creativity after promoting post-traumatic growth.\nThird, the research results confirm H3a, H3b, H3c, and previous research results. Intrusive rumination is negatively correlated with resilience. People with high resilience can produce positive emotions and reduce the incidence of intrusive rumination (Li et al., 2018). When individuals generate intrusive rumination because of traumatic events, a higher level of resilience can promote higher cognitive flexibility and better and faster adjustment of emotions. Furthermore, relevant studies have shown that resilience can positively predict post-traumatic growth (Affleck and Tennen, 1996); that is, the higher the\nTABLE 6 | Conditional indirect effect at specific levels of psychological resilience when mediated by post-traumatic growth.\nConditional effect of DR Effect Boot SE 95%CI\nLow (M \u2212 1SD) 0.345 0.100 [0.149,0.540]\nMedium (M) 0.559 0.093 [0.376,0.742]\nHigh (M + 1SD) 0.773 0.134 [0.511,1.036]\nlevel of resilience, the higher the degree of post-traumatic growth, consistent with Hooper et al. (2008), who reported that individuals with high resilience will report higher levels of posttraumatic growth. Individuals with high resilience can better selfregulate and treat events with an optimistic attitude. In order to help themselves out of the plight of trauma, they can maintain an optimistic and positive attitude and fully mobilize the resources of their personality and their environment when facing adversity. In addition, studies have shown that individuals who exhibit resilience or post-traumatic growth can show strong resistance to possible trauma in the future (Davis et al., 2007). Finally, resilience is closely related to creativity, and it can be predicted that college students with higher levels of resilience have more creative thinking (Liang et al., 2021). This is because people with higher levels of cognitive flexibility can better deal with negative situations and can translate negative information into positive ideas, making it easier to recover from adversity and to continue to engage in innovation (McFadden and Basting, 2010). Individuals with a high level of creativity can solve problems in a variety of ways, which is conducive to improving their resilience (Seale et al., 2013). Emotional flexibility is a component of resilience, which is consistent with the flexibility dimension of creative personality (Thompson et al., 2011). Therefore, it is understandable that there is a significant correlation between resilience and creativity.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 789844\nFourth, this study found that resilience plays a regulatory role in the process of the intrusive rumination of participating college students affecting post-traumatic growth, which confirms H3. And the higher the level of resilience, the more significant is its regulatory role between intrusive rumination and post-traumatic growth. Post-traumatic growth originates from the struggle with traumatic events rather than traumatic events themselves. In this process, the realization of growth is dependent on individual strength (Casali et al., 2021). When individuals are inevitably immersed in negative thoughts, resilience, as an individual trait, can make individuals recover from and adjust to difficulties, setbacks and misfortunes (Hooper et al., 2008). It can be seen that education should continuously improve the level of resilience of college students, so that even when intrusive rumination occurs after traumatic events, individuals can better restore and regulate their emotions, thereby promoting their continued development."

            "text": "In terms of theoretical significance, this study links intrusive rumination with creativity, expanding knowledge of the impact of intrusive rumination on the creativity of college students in the face of public-health emergencies. Different from previous studies conducted in a safe environment, data collection for this study occurred in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its results can better reflect reality. In addition, this study analyzed the mediating effect of the post-traumatic growth of participating college students. The results show that intrusive rumination will enhance their post-traumatic growth and ultimately have a positive impact on their creativity, and that resilience has a positive moderating effect on the relationship between intrusive rumination and post-traumatic growth.\nWith regard to practice, the relationship between the four variables can help teachers and school administrators better cultivate students\u2019 creativity and better attend to students\u2019 mental health after traumatic events. Students inevitably have some negative emotions after experiencing a traumatic event. At such times, they should be encouraged to psychological resilience training. Helping them to look at traumatic events from different perspectives and to discover the potential meaning of traumatic events may reduce their psychological stress and promote their post-traumatic growth, which has positive significance for the cultivation of their creativity."

Although a cross-sectional study combined with data analysis can explore the relationship between different variables, it is difficult to determine the causal relationship due to the short time span. In a future study, researchers could conduct repeated surveys of the same respondents over a period of time and expand the coverage of samples.\n(2) The data for this study come from self-reports by the respondents. Although there is no serious common method bias according to the Harman single factor test results, the generalizability of the research results is undermined because the respondents are from the same college and are affected by social\nexpectations and their environment. Therefore, in the future, data collection could include parental reports, teacher assessments, and peer nomination methods.\n(3) All respondents were from the same university, and the proportion of males and females in the sample is not equal by the limitations of investigation conditions. In future studies, in order to further test the external validity of the research results, more attention should be paid to the extensiveness of sample sources and gender balance in the recruitment of participants.\n(4) We have not yet explored the impact of gender, profession, and other factors on the four variables, and control variables could be added to future studies with the goal of furthering understanding of the relationships among the four variables. Future research could also explore the effects of different types of rumination on creativity and post-traumatic growth."

The results show that intrusive rumination has a positive predictive effect on creativity, and that post-traumatic growth plays a mediating role between the two. In addition, resilience plays a regulatory role in post-traumatic growth as the first half of the mediating path between intrusive rumination and creativity. Specifically, at a high level of resilience, intrusive rumination has a more significant positive predictive effect on post-traumatic growth. These findings provide more evidence for the relationship between creativity and mental health and reveal the impact of a traumatic event on adolescents."
