    "abstractText": "One of the most widespread biotas in the sea is the sponge. Callyspongia is a sponge genus found in the seas, making it easily available. In this review, the pharmacological activity and mechanism of action of the secondary metabolites of Callyspongia spp. are addressed, which may lead to the development of new drugs and targeted therapeutic approaches. Several scientific databases, such as Google Scholar, PubMed, ResearchGate, Science Direct, Springer Link, and Wiley Online Library, were mined to obtain relevant information. In the 41 articles reviewed, Callyspongia spp. was reported to possess pharmacological activities such as cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines (36%), antifungal (10%), anti-inflammatory (10%), immunomodulatory (10%), antidiabetic and antiobesity (6%), antimicrobial (8%), antioxidant (4%), antineurodegenerative (4%), antihypercholesterolemic (2%), antihypertensive (2%), antiparasitic (2%), antiallergic (2%), antiviral (2%), antiosteoporotic (2%), and antituberculosis (2%) activities. Of these, the antioxidant, antituberculosis, and anti-inflammatory activities of Callyspongia extract were weaker compared with that of the control drugs; however, other activities, particularly cytotoxicity, show promise, and the compounds responsible may be developed into new drugs.",

            "text": "The ocean, which covers 71% of the earth\u2019s surface, regulates our climate and contains abundant resources [1]. The sea encompasses a large area, but it is well connected, and the temperature is less extreme compared with that on land. Although containing more biodiversity, only 16% of all species have been identified [2]. One of the most ubiquitous sea organisms is the sponge. Sponges are often abundant in shallow water habitats, making them a unique biodiversity component [3]. They are one of the most diverse sessile organisms, with approximately 8876 valid species identified worldwide. Each has its unique characteristics, while some features are shared [4]. Callyspongia belongs to the family Callyspongidae. More than 60 species are widely distributed in the tropical sea [5]. It is also found in the Indian, Western Atlantic, and Eastern Pacific oceans, including Indonesia [6], the Red sea [7,8], Cuba [4], Barbados [9], Brazil [10,11], and Ecuador [12]. At a depth of 6\u201310 m below sea level, Callyspongia spp. can live under coral reefs, ranging from moderate to damaged conditions, or in habitats dominated by hard coral, sand, and coral rubble [13]. Sponges from the Callyspongia genus are formed from primary, secondary, and tertiary spongin fibers [4]. Callyspongia sponges are encrusting, form a single erect branch or a mass of round branches, and many are bifurcated. The longest branch that has been observed is\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 217. https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo13020217 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/metabolites\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 217 2 of 29\napproximately 40 cm. The branches are approximately 100\u2013150 mm in diameter and have oscula or excretory organs that are slightly elevated, numerous, scattered throughout, and 0.5\u20132 mm in diameter. When pressed or cut, Callyspongia spp. secrete mucus. They have a smooth surface [14]. Skeletal fractions, such as spicules and cell debris, constitute 69.8% of the biomass of Callyspongia spp., the spongy cells (choanosomes) comprise 18.8%, and bacterial pellets account for 11.3%. The skeleton fraction dominates the biomass, resulting in the stiffer morphology of Callyspongia sponges [13]. The morphology of the callyspongia species varies. For example, Callyspongia (Cladochalina) aerizusa (Figure 1e) and Callyspongia (Siphonochalina) siphonella (Figure 1a) have a tubular and clustered form, but with different colors, tubes, and oscula size. Callyspongia aerizusa has a green\u2013orange color, whereas Callyspongia siphonella has pale lavender color. There are also species with varying forms, such as Callyspongia (Cladochalina) diffusa (Figure 1b), which has a dull champagne pink or purplish-pink color, long or short thick cylindrical branches that vary from fanlike to upright or irregular [15]. Other species have unlikely forms, Callyspongia samarensis is called a spaghetti sponge because of its forms (Figure 1d) [16]. The color of Callyspongia spp. also varies with bright colors, such as Callyspongia truncate (Figure 1c), or deep colors like Callyspongia aerizusa.\nMetabolites 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 31\nSponges from the Callyspongia genus are formed from primary, secondary, and tertiary spongin fibers [4].

There are several drugs originating from sponges that have entered clinical trials and approved, including cytarabine (Ara-C) for cancer treatment and vidarabine as an antiviral [17].

Inhibiting this enzyme reduces caloric intake by attenuating appetite, suppressing hunger, and increasing satiety [71,72], thereby supporting weight loss [73] to a moderate level [74]. It is also one of the targets of diabetes therapy. Compared with \u03b1-amylase, inhibiting \u03b1-glucosidase can improve hyperglycemia, especially postprandial hyperglycemia, by decreasing glucose production (Figure 3) [75]. Compounds, such as callyspongiamide A and B as well as disamide A (Figure 3), exert antihypercholesterolemic activity, which can also lead to an antiobesity effect by inhibiting sterol O-acyltransferase (SOAT), the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of cholesteryl ester [76]. In addition, other sterols may be used as activators or substrates of this enzyme [77], which implicates it as a potential drug target [61] in hypercholesterolemia; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In a cell-based testing assay, the IC50 values of callyspongiamide A against SOAT 1 and SOAT 2 were 0.78 \u00b1 0.19 and 2.8 \u00b1 0.72 \u00b5M, those of callyspongiamide B were 1.2 \u00b1 0.31 and 2.4 \u00b1 0.96 \u00b5M, whereas those of disamide A were 5.2 \u00b1 0.93 and 4.2 \u00b1 0.76 \u00b5M.

Callyspongia sp. also contains \u03b2-Sitosterol. This compound exhibits potent antidiabetic activity related to insulin receptor activation and increased glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation to adipose tissue [78,79]. In addition, these compounds can potentially maintain glucose homeostasis through sensitization of insulin resistance by increasing the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and GLUT-4 (Figure 4) [80].

It inhibits the maturation of IL-1\u03b2 via the NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and inhibits other inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 [86]. In a carrageenin-induced edema model in bilaterally adrenalectomized rats, \u03b2-Sitosterol exhibited a 54% anti-inflammatory effect at a dose of 320 mg/kg, which was weaker than the control, oxyphenbutazone, which had a 74% antiinflammatory effect at a dose of 100 mg/kg [37]. Therefore, \u03b2-Sitosterol has no potential as an anti-inflammatory agent. Niphatoxin C significantly affects the viability of pre-monocytic THP 1 cells, which express the P2X7 receptor [65]. Activation of this receptor promotes inflammation by releasing inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2, and by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome [87,88]. Thus, an antagonist of this receptor may inhibit the secretion of these cytokines (Figure 7). Furthermore, it can inhibit allograft rejection [87], sterile liver inflammation [88], and can potentially treat inflammatory diseases, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [28,37].

Although the specific mechanism of 5-bromo trisindoline and 6-bromo trisindoline is unknown, some indole alkaloids were known to interfere with the nuclear factor-\u03baB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathways [90,91], preventing the synthesis or action of specific pro-inflammatory cytokines, and suppressing histamine release and nitric oxide production (Figure 7) [92,93].
