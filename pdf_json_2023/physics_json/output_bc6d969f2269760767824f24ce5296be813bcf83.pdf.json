    "abstractText": "In the last three years, COVID-19 has impacted the world with back-to-back waves leading to devastating consequences. SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, was first detected in 2019 and since then has spread to 228 countries. Even though the primary focus of research groups was diverted to fight against COVID-19, yet no dedicated drug has been developed to combat the emergent life-threatening medical conditions. In this study, 35 phytocompounds and 43 drugs were investigated for comparative docking analysis. Molecular docking and virtual screening were performed against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein of 13 variants using AutoDock Vina tool 1.5.6 and Discovery Studio, respectively, to identify the most efficient drugs. Selection of the most suitable compounds with the best binding affinity was done after screening for toxicity, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) properties and drug-likeliness. The potential candidates were discovered to be Liquiritin (binding affinities ranging between \u22127.0 and \u22128.1 kcal/mol for the 13 variants) and Apigenin (binding affinities ranging between \u22126.8 and \u22127.3 kcal/mol for the 13 variants) based on their toxicity and consistent binding affinity with the Spike protein of all variants. The stability of the protein\u2013ligand complex was determined using Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of Apigenin with the Delta plus variant of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, Liquiritin and Apigenin were also found to be less toxic than the presently used drugs and showed promising results based on in silico studies, though, confirmation using in vitro studies is required. This in-depth comparative investigation suggests potential drug candidates to fight against SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

            "text": "It is not unusual that a Coronaviridae virus has infected humans. In 2002\u201303, there was a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, followed by that, in 2012 the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERSCoV) emerged and affected the Middle Eastern countries (Rabaan et\u00a0al. 2020). The tremendous evolutionary adaptability of coronaviruses to the environment and host specificity eventually gave rise to SARS-CoV-2, which has been inflicting chaos in the world with a series of new mutations (Zheng 2020). COVID-19 has surfed successive waves in the preceding two years, with new variants surfacing one after the other, leaving the infection vulnerable to rumours because of its poor understanding (Maher et\u00a0 al. 2021). According to the World Health Organisation, there have been a total of 5 Variants of Concern (VOCs), namely Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron (Chugh et\u00a0al. 2022).\nOwing to the mutability of this virus, many variants of SARS-CoV-2 have originated and have been more infectious and transmissible than before. Therefore, one of the major obstacles in controlling the Pandemic has been the absence of an efficient therapeutic strategy against the existing and emerging variants (Aleem et\u00a0al. 2022).\nComputational biology has been proved to be a crucial tool in indicating the potential phytocompounds from medicinal plants and repurposed pharmaceuticals in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 (Scherman and Fetro 2020; Toor et\u00a0al. 2021). Within the initial few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a rise in clinical trials of repurposing drugs such as Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Ritonavir, Lopinavir, Ivermectin, Interferon and several other immunomodulators and anti-inflammatory drugs. However, most of them either had serious side effects\u00a0or did not seem to affect the virus significantly (Toor et\u00a0al. 2021; Hall and Ji 2020; Khanna et\u00a0al. 2021; Martinez 2021; Yadav et\u00a0al. 2021). In parallel, research into herbal cures (phytocompounds) also grew rapidly due to their minimal adverse effects and widespread acceptance (Basu et\u00a0al. 2020; Pk et\u00a0al. 2020). Furthermore, the use of plant extracts in traditional medicine and novel drugs have been productive multiple times over the past few centuries (Hakobyan et\u00a0al. 2016; Rolta et\u00a0al. 2021).\nWith the growing number of new variants, it has become necessary to analyse the differential effects of the available therapeutics and to assess their efficacy on each variant of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, a rapid and cost effective in silico method to identify existing molecules or phytocompounds could help in building a repository for clinical trials. Moreover, it would decrease the time for discovery of new drug candidates and may provide significant help for drug development that can be interpreted into clinical applications to combat SARS-CoV-2 (Dotolo et\u00a0al. 2021; Rudrapal and J. Khairnar S et\u00a0al. 2020).\nIn this study, various drugs and phytocompounds have been selected for molecular docking with Spike glycoprotein, a trimeric club shaped structural protein of the SARSCoV-2 virus, which facilitates viral fusion with the host cell (Chugh et\u00a0al. 2022). As Spike gene has a nucleotide mutation rate of 8.066 \u00d7 10\u20134 substitutions per site per year, while the SARS-CoV-2 genome has a rate of 6.677 \u00d7 10\u20134 substitutions per site per year, so certain mutations, particularly in the Spike glycoprotein, have been believed to enhance viral infectivity and transmissibility, resulting in emergence of several variants classified as Variants of Concern (VOC) and Variants of Interest (VOI) by the World Health Organization (Hu et\u00a0al. 2021; Wang et\u00a0al. 2020; Singh et\u00a0al. 2021a, b, c, d). Hence, in this comparative study, molecular docking was performed with Spike glycoprotein from 13 variants of SARS-CoV-2. This may prove to be beneficial in curing COVID-19 as the best phytocompound and drug, effective on all the variants have been compared and analysed using in silico studies."

Docked structures of the protein\u2013ligand complexes (Apigenin with Delta plus Variant) were used in the simulation study. The target protein was processed and the topology file was prepared using pdb2gmx and GROMOS54a7_atb. Force field was downloaded from the automated topology builder website and incorporated into GROMACS. The ligand topology file was prepared using the automated topology builder (ATB) version 3.0. The solvent addition was done in a cubic box using a box distance 1.0\u00a0nm from closest atom in the protein. To neutralise the device, the Cl- ions calculated from the genion module for each protein were used. The energy was minimised using the steepest descent algorithm with 50,000 steps and a cumulative force of 5\u00a0kJ\u00a0 mol-1, as well as the Verlet cut-off scheme with Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) columbic interactions. During the equilibration process, position restraints were used. Following that, NVT equilibration was performed at 300\u00a0K with 100\u00a0ps in 50,000 steps, using the leapfrog integrator and NPT equilibration was performed with Parrinello-Rahman (pressure coupling), 1\u00a0bar reference pressure, and 100\u00a0ps in 50,000 steps.

MD simulation data revealed that RMSD of Apigenin, complexed with Delta plus variant of SARS-CoV-2 was stable from the start of the simulation and remained stable upto 100\u00a0ns time (Fig.\u00a05A). RMSF of protein\u2013ligand complex was done to study the flexibility and fluctuation in interactive residues in secondary structure of target proteins (Sivaramakrishnan et\u00a0 al. 2020; Kumar et\u00a0al. 2014).The RMSF plot for Apigenin fit over the Delta plus protein and showed less residual fluctuation in alpha helical and beta strands. Residues ranging from 100 to 300, 730, 900 to 1150 showed the strongest interactions with Apigenin as shown in Fig.\u00a05B.

            "text": "The mutations in the RBD region of the 18 amino acid long SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein strengthen the virus's capacity for transmission. To understand the genesis of novel variants, research has focused on the Spike glycoprotein. The Spike protein's RBD region mutations can make closer contact with hACE2, which results in a stronger binding affinity and probably enhanced VOCs infectivity (Chugh et\u00a0al. 2022). Among all the previously circulating VOCs, the Delta variant, has shown adverse effects on patients and has caused twice as many hospitalizations (Edara et\u00a0al. 2021). The Delta was found to be 60% more transmissible than the highly infectious Alpha variant identified in the United Kingdom in September 2020 (Duong 2021). The strain undoubtedly contributed to India's massive second wave of cases. According to data available on GISAID, it had spread to 208 countries as of December 19, 2022 (https:// gisaid. org/ hcov19- varia nts/). Delta plus, also known as the AY.1 strain which showed a rapid spread, was found to bind easily to the ACE-2 receptor, and was potentially resistant to monoclonal antibody therapy (Roy and Roy 2021). As per GISAID database, apart from these variants, the Omicron variant, which was discovered in Botswana, has now spread to 208 countries as of December 19, 2022 (https:// gisaid. org/ hcov19- varia nts/). In regional genomic surveillance, XBB, a recombinant of the BA.2.10.1 and BA.2.75 sublineages, has been reported in 35 countries with a global prevalence of 1.3%. The regional immunological landscape and COVID-19 vaccination rates appear to have an impact on establishing whether the increased immune escape of XBB is sufficient\n3 Biotech (2023) 13:36\n1 3\nPage 9 of 17 36\nto cause new infection waves (Kurhade et\u00a0al. 2022). Hence, repurposing existing drugs against potential targets of the virus could be an effective strategy to speed up the drug discovery process (Bhardwaj et\u00a0al. 2021a, b, c).\nMolecular docking facilitates the prediction of protein\u2013ligand affinity and the structure of the protein\u2013ligand\ncomplex. Additionally, it can be used to investigate the binding difference between the two molecules, which is useful information for lead optimization. In the early stages of the pandemic, Ivermectin was considered as a viable therapeutic drug against SARS-CoV-2. Despite the fact that it violated Lipinski's rule and was immunotoxic, being FDA\n1 3"

It showed strongest affinity with the majority of SARS-CoV-2 variants (as justified in our study Table\u00a03) and was found to minimise the probability of mortality in COVID-19 (Bryant et\u00a0al. 2021; Caly et\u00a0al. 2020; Krolewiecki et\u00a0al. 2021; Zaidi and DehganiMobaraki 2022; Mastrangelo et\u00a0al. 2012). Also, Australia\u2019s National COVID-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce and the World Health Organization suggested the use of Ivermectin only in clinical trials (FAQs 2022). Later on, a review of 10 randomised controlled trials by Roman et\u00a0al. concluded\nthat Ivermectin is not a viable option for the treatment of COVID-19 patients (Roman et\u00a0al. 2022). Consequently, it became a weak contender.\nSince ancient times compounds extracted from traditional medicinal plants with strong antiviral activity have been used to treat viral infections. It has been found that phytocompounds can inactivate SARS-CoV-2 variants by binding to the Spike glycoprotein and thus inhibit their function like Curcumin, a component of turmeric (Curcuma longa), is believed to have potential properties to prevent or treat diseases such as cancer and viral infections (Manoharan et\u00a0al.\nmiLogP TPSA Natoms MW nON nOHNH nviolations\nName of compound/antibiotic Dpnh (NADH) \u2212\u00a03.59 317.64 44 665.45 21 10 3 Coenzyme A \u2212\u00a04.44 346.58 48 767.54 23 10 3 Flavin Adenine\nDinucleotide (FAD) Adeflavin\n\u2212\u00a02.69 362.96 53 785.56 24 10 3\nAzithromycin 2.73 180.09 52 749 14 5 2 Colistin \u2212\u00a05.74 490.65 81 1155.45 29 23 3 Liquiritin 0.41 145.91 30 418.4 9 5 0 Glycyrrhizic acid 1.97 267.04 58 822.94 16 8 3 Raltegravir \u2212\u00a00.81 152.25 32 444.42 11 3 1 Lopinavir 5.69 119.99 46 628.81 9 4 2 Ritonavir 7.51 145.78 50 720.96 11 4 3 Doxycycline \u2212\u00a00.87 181.61 32 444.44 10 7 1 Ivermectin 4.58 170.09 62 875.11 14 3 2 Cangrelor 1.33 255.92 44 776.37 17 7 3 Nafamostat 2.29 138.08 26 347.38 7 7 1 Abemaciclib 3.94 75 37 506.61 8 1 1 Name of Phytocompound Emodin 3.01 94.83 20 270.24 5 3 0 Artemisinin 3.32 54.01 20 282.34 5 0 0 Aloe-emodin 2.42 94.83 20 270.24 5 3 0 Anthrarufin 3.13 74.6 18 240.21 4 2 0 Alizarine 2.9 74.6 18 240.21 4 2 0 Dantron 3.13 74.6 18 240.21 4 2 0 1,8 dihydroxy-3-car-\nboxyl-9,10-anthraquinone or rhein\n3 111.9 21 284.22 6 3 0\nCucurbitacin B 2.83 138.2 40 558.71 8 3 1 Apigenin 2.46 90.89 20 270.24 5 3 0 Costunolide 2.89 26.3 17 232.32 2 0 0 Nelfinavir 5.47 101.89 40 567.8 7 4 2 Kaempferol 2.17 111.12 21 286.24 6 4 0 Curcumin 2.3 93.07 27 368.38 6 2 0 Fisetin 1.97 111.12 21 286.24 6 4 0 Quercetin 1.68 131.35 22 302.24 7 5 0 Isorhamnetin 1.99 120.36 23 316.26 7 4 0 Genistein 2.27 90.89 20 270.24 5 3 0 Luteolin 1.97 111.12 21 286.24 6 4 0\n3 Biotech (2023) 13:36\n1 3\nPage 11 of 17 36\n2020; Rattis et\u00a0al. 2021; Singh et\u00a0al. 2021). Artemisinin and Emodin have also been found to interact with SARS-CoV-2 and inhibit its Spike glycoprotein (Rolta et\u00a0al. 2021; Nair et\u00a0al. 2021; Sehailia and Chemat 2021).\nAll this led to investigation of binding affinity of drugs as well as phytocompounds with the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 using molecular docking. Results from our study show that phytocompounds exhibit the binding affinity as high as drugs. Also, Sathya et\u00a0al. has reported the promising results of Liquirtin against H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A virus which further confirms its anti-viral drug property and makes it a competitive candidate for the treatment of COVID-19 (Sathya et\u00a0al. 2020). Zhu et\u00a0al. also proposed that Liquiritin mimics Type I IFN, which inhibits viral\nreplication (Zhu et\u00a0al. 2020). Our study also suggested Liquirtin as one of the promising drugs, as it exhibits high and uniform binding affinity with the Spike glycoprotein of all 13 variants (between \u22127.0 and \u22128.1\u00a0kcal/mol). Although it was found to be immuno-toxic, zero violations of Lipinski's Rule make it a candidate for research.\nSimilarly various studies have attempted to carry out in silico validation of phytocompounds to cure various diseases (Rolta et\u00a0al. 2021; Mehta et\u00a0al. 2021; Salaria et\u00a0al. 2022). Rolta et\u00a0al. 2021 (Rolta et\u00a0al. 2021) also reported that phytocompounds (emodin, aloe-emodin, anthrarufin, alizarine, and dantron) of R. emodias inhibitor of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein\u00a0of\u00a0SARS-CoV-2. Some of the bioactive molecules from tea have also shown promising binding affinities\nApigenin \u2212\u00a07 2Arg1012 Thr959, Ala956, Tyr1005, Leu960, Ser1001, Gln963, Thr1004, Gln1008, Gln952, Gln955 \u2212\u00a07.1 - Thr 959, Gln 1008, Gln 952, Gln 955, Ala 956, Arg 1012, Tyr 1005, Leu 960, Ser 1001, Gln 963, Thr 1004\nLiquiritin \u2212\u00a07.3 5Thr300, Ser50, Asn315, Arg317, Gln626 Cys299, Ala290, Cys289, Glu296, Lys302, Thr628, Thr272, Ser314, Trp631, Gln319\n\u2212\u00a07.3 Gln626, Leu627, Ser314, Thr300, Thr272, Ser50\nArg271, Cys299, Ala290, Thr272, Thr628, Pro629, Glu296, Lys302, Cys289\n1 3"

Bhardwaj et\u00a0al. 2021). Hakobyan et\u00a0al. demonstrated the in\u00a0vitro effect of Apigenin on African swine fever virus infection by interfering with the viral cell cycle at an early stage in their study, implying that Apigenin could be an effective candidate for extended in\u00a0vitro\nand in\u00a0vivo studies combining dosage effectivity (Hakobyan et\u00a0al. 2016). In present analysis as well Apigenin expressed the strongest and most consistent binding affinity with all strains (between -6.8 and -7.3\u00a0kcal/mol). Additionally, Apigenin exhibited no toxicity and zero violations of Lipinski\u2019s rule.\nMultiobjective optimisation in drug discovery field implies that a drug should be potent in being active,\n3 Biotech (2023) 13:36\n1 3\nPage 13 of 17 36\nnon-toxic, orally bioavailable, free of side effects, with strong binding affinity, GI absorption (Thomford et\u00a0al. 2018; Lambrinidis and Tsantili-Kakoulidou 2021). These parameters aid in the screening and recommendation of the prospective drug candidates for in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo studies. Considering all the important parameters, we propose that Apigenin and Liquiritin could be promising options for the treatment of COVID-19 and that they should be investigated further in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo to see if they can be used to build therapeutic strategies to combat future SARS-CoV-2 peaks."
