Conflicting findings exist regarding alterations in both kinematics and plantar pressure. Thus, this systematic review and subsequent meta-analysis were conducted to investigate the impact of general and localized muscle fatigue on kinematics and plantar pressure distribution during running. Initial searches were executed on 30 November 2021 and updated on 29 April 2023, encompassing PubMed, The Cochrane Library, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science without imposing any restrictions on publication dates or employing additional filters. Our PECOS criteria included cross-sectional studies on healthy adults during their treadmill running to mainly evaluate local muscle fatigue, plantar pressure distribution, biomechanics of running (kinematics, kinetics, and EMG results), and temporospatial parameters. The literature search identified 6626 records, with 4626 studies removed for titles and abstract screening. Two hundred and one articles were selected for full-text screening, and 20 studies were included in qualitative data synthesis. The pooled analysis showed a non-significant decrease in maximum pressure under the right forefoot\u2019s metatarsus, which was more than the left rearfoot after local muscle fatigue at a velocity of 15 km/h (p-values = 0.48 and 0.62). The results were homogeneous and showed that local muscle fatigue did not significantly affect the right forefoot\u2019s stride frequency and length (p-values = 0.75 and 0.38). Strength training for the foot muscles, mainly focusing on the dorsiflexors, is recommended to prevent running-related injuries. Utilizing a standardized knee and ankle joint muscle fatigue assessment protocol is advised. Future experiments should focus on various shoes for running and varying foot strike patterns for",

            "text": "During running, the foot is subjected to forces equivalent to two to three times the runner\u2019s body weight. The lower extremity muscles are crucial in providing effective shock absorption to prevent incorrect or excessive loading of the passive musculoskeletal system, primarily through eccentric contraction of the plantar flexors [1]. When these muscles experience fatigue, their ability to adequately absorb impact forces diminishes, potentially affecting the passive musculoskeletal system and elevating the risk of runningrelated injuries. Over 90% of running-related issues are related to the lower extremities, with approximately one-third involving the knee, lower leg, and foot [2,3]. The annual incidence of lower extremity problems among runners ranges from 19.4% to 79.3% [4]. Numerous studies have demonstrated the correlation between muscular fatigue and the\nSports 2023, 11, 241. https://doi.org/10.3390/sports11120241 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sports\nSports 2023, 11, 241 2 of 27\nrisk of injury [5,6]. However, despite this body of research, how fatigue specifically alters foot loading remains unclear. Understanding these changes in foot loading due to fatigue is vital for tailoring injury-preventative training recommendations, particularly for runners with a history of lower extremity injuries, who face an increased risk of re-injury [5,6]. In an ideal scenario, preventing running injuries before they manifest is crucial [3]. However, the surge in runners has been accompanied by a rise in associated health issues, predominantly affecting the lower limbs [7]. Multiple studies have highlighted the connection between fatigue and injury [3,8], yet the exact relationship between injuries and foot strike patterns remains elusive [9]. The exploration of the effects of general and muscle fatigue on plantar pressure distribution and increased ground reaction force during running has seen a significant increase in research since 2006. However, due to a wide array of results, the precise impact of fatigue remains unclear. In a meta-analysis examining the alteration of ground reaction force following fatigue, Zadpoor and Nikooyan [10] highlighted that most studies have primarily focused on the active peak vertical ground reaction force, given its reflection of muscular reaction during ground contact. Two major theories dominate the ongoing debate on this subject. The first theory posits that fatigue diminishes the capacity for adequate shock absorption, causing an increase in ground reaction force to counterbalance this effect. On the other hand, the second theory suggests a reduction in ground reaction force due to the human body\u2019s protective strategy to prevent injuries [10]. The meta-analysis incorporated eight studies that assessed the active peak of the ground reaction force using force plates before and after fatigue induced by running. Among these, three studies demonstrated a significant decrease [11\u201313], while four articles indicated minor, nonsignificant changes [14\u201316]. Another study explored ground reaction force during running after inducing local muscle fatigue in the dorsiflexors and invertors of the foot [17]. The findings revealed a non-significant increase in dorsiflexors and a reduction in ground reaction force due to inversion. Other studies examining ground reaction forces have revealed conflicting results. Morin et al. [18] and Morin et al. [19] observed a significant reduction in ground reaction force after extreme fatigue induced by either a 24-h treadmill run or an ultra-mountain marathon. The decrease ranged from 2.24 to 2.14 times the body mass in one study and 2.32 to 2.17 times in another [18,19]. Quammen et al. [20] compared two different fatigue protocols. One protocol involved strength tests and sprints, while the other incorporated strength tests followed by a 30-min treadmill run. Surprisingly, both protocols led to a non-significant increase in the active peak of the ground reaction force. Studies demonstrate varied plantar pressure distribution across different foot areas following running, ranging from 10 km to a full marathon and even 30-min runs [21,22]. Forefoot pressure specifically increases after running distances of 10 km to a marathon and during 30-min runs [21\u201323]; this heightened forefoot pressure is also noted after inducing local fatigue in the plantar flexors and dorsiflexors [24]. However, the effect of runninginduced fatigue on pressure distribution across different foot areas remains unclear. Some studies have reported decreased pressure under the heel [2,21,22,25], while others have observed a significant increase [22,26]. Pressure under the toes was significantly reduced in some instances [2,24], while two other studies found no significant differences [21,26]. The lack of consensus can be attributed to variations in fatigue protocols and the specific foot areas examined. Another challenge lies in understanding how fatigue influences foot strike patterns during running. Although it is commonly assumed that fatigue alters foot strike patterns, conclusive evidence is lacking [27,28]. Fatigue may lead to runners modifying their foot strikes during running, potentially increasing the risk of injury [5,6]. Therefore, determining whether fatigue induces muscular imbalances and alters foot strike patterns is crucial for injury prevention [29]. Fatigue exerts an impact on both stride frequency and stride length during running. Some studies have shown a decrease in stride frequency and an increase in stride length [2,15].\nSports 2023, 11, 241 3 of 27\nHowever, there were also instances of only minor changes [30] or even no changes in stride frequency [25]. Additionally, treadmill running introduces alterations in stride frequency [2,31\u201333]. At moderate speeds on a treadmill, there is a tendency for a reduction in stride length and an increase in stride frequency compared to natural ground running [34]. However, it is essential to note that the influence of the treadmill on running movements has led to controversial discussions regarding the results [2]. Despite the controversies, these treadmill-induced changes have been accepted by various authors as representative of running investigations [31,32,35]. Regarding local muscle fatigue, the influence of muscle fatigue on the plantar flexors and dorsiflexors has been investigated in various publications. However, there is significant variability in methodologies, leading to varying muscle activation outcomes. A common limitation is the failure to consider critical factors like foot strike patterns, leg dominance, running speeds, distances, and repeated measurements. Many studies utilize exhaustive running, typically a 30-min run at 85% of the individual\u2019s maximal aerobic speed, to induce fatigue [2,10]. However, distinguishing the changes directly resulting from local muscle fatigue remains challenging. The dorsiflexors and plantar flexors of the foot are highly susceptible to severe fatigue during running, considering their involvement in 50 to 85% of the running cycle [36]. Prior research has indicated that plantar flexors experience fatigue after a 2-h running session [37,38]. Similarly, running activities induce significant fatigue in the dorsiflexors [39,40] despite their primary activity during the swing phase. Notably, the muscular imbalance becomes evident during running with progressive fatigue. The activity of plantar flexors remains relatively constant, while that of dorsiflexors decreases, resulting in an imbalance [41]. In the domain of kinematics, studies have examined the ankle and knee angles of runners post-fatigue. Kellis and Liassou [36] highlighted that the knee and ankle angles during touch-down play a vital role in joint stability and are particularly crucial during toe-off. Bruggemann et al. [42] observed increased rearfoot angle during touch-down and delayed attainment of its maximum value after fatigue. Furthermore, Christina et al. [17] observed a decrease in the ankle angle following local muscle fatigue of the dorsiflexors, while fatigue of the plantar flexors contributed to a notable increase in the ankle angle. Fatigue of the ankle musculature due to movement resulted in a decrease in the dorsiflexor angle during the stance phase [36]. A reduced dorsiflexor angle signifies that a greater portion of the heel has contact with the ground during stance, facilitating enhanced absorption of landing forces [2]. This kinematic adaptation involves an increased knee flexor angle [43] and reduced ankle angle during the stance phase [17]. Therefore, the present review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the influence of general and local muscle fatigue on kinematics and plantar pressure distribution during running. It was assumed that the plantar pressure distribution under the foot would differ according to fatigue protocols; they submitted different results, and this is due to using other fatigue protocols."

            "text": "In this review and meta-analysis, we investigated the impact of muscle fatigue on kinematics and plantar pressure distribution during running, revealing varying results due to different fatigue protocols by conducting an extensive literature search and retrieving a total of 6626 records. After removing 2000 duplications, we were left with 4626 studies for titles and abstract screening. Subsequently, 201 articles were selected for full-text screening. Among these, 20 studies were included in our qualitative data synthesis [2,21,22,43,50\u201365]. However, only three studies were eligible for our meta-analysis [50\u201352]. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate how both fatigue during running and local muscle fatigue impact kinematics and plantar pressure distribution during running. We discovered that the plantar pressure distribution under the foot varies based on the fatigue protocols applied. Moreover, the results indicated differing outcomes when employing fatigue procedures involving running or jumping compared to standard muscular fatigue protocols, which produced consistent results for the ankle joint muscles.\nSports 2023, 11, 241 21 of 27\nOur results showed a non-significant increase in stride frequency of the right and left forefoot as well as the right and left rearfoot after local muscle fatigue at a velocity of 15 km/h (MD = 3.5; 95% CI [\u22124.65\u201311.66]; p = 0.40). Also, Alfuth et al. [25] found no changes in stride frequency. Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez et al. [2] demonstrated that runners effectively mitigated fatigue effects by adjusting different components of their overall gait pattern and moderating their running speed. The study revealed that runners reduced their stride frequency similarly on both treadmill and overground surfaces (0.89% in S1 and 2.78% in S2). The experiments were conducted at two speeds: S1 = 3.33 m/s and S2 = 4.00 m/s, both before and after a fatigue protocol involving a 30-min run at 85% of their maximal aerobic speed. Gerlach et al. [15] found that stride frequency decreased significantly before and after fatigue. The present results showed a non-significant decrease in stride length of the right and left forefoot as well as the right and left rearfoot after local muscle fatigue at a velocity of 15 km/h (MD = \u22120.83; 95% CI [\u22125.93\u20134.26]; p = 0.75). These results are different from those of Derrick et al. [43]. They found changes in running stride length after fatigue. The current findings indicated a non-significant reduction in maximum pressure observed in both the right and left forefoot, as well as the right and left rearfoot, following local muscle fatigue; this aligns with the study by Olivier et al. [24], which reported increased forefoot pressure and decreased toe pressure. Similarly, Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez et al. [2] observed alterations in plantar pressure distribution. Additionally, Willems et al. [23] documented significant changes in peak force (12.4%), mean force (11.9%), and impulse (17.6%). Numerous publications have reached a consensus regarding the fatigue-induced increase in forefoot loading. Several studies have consistently demonstrated elevations in peak pressures and impulses beneath the metatarsals following fatigue. For instance, Alfuth et al. [25] observed a significant increase, up to 14%, under the central and lateral metatarsal heads during barefoot walking. Similarly, studies by Willems et al. [23] and Weist et al. [26] reported greater peak pressures due to fatigue across the whole arch, particularly under the medial arch, leading to an increased relative load on the medial arch. Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez et al. [2] also contributed to this understanding. Moreover, Bisiaux et al. [21] found a significant rise in pressure peak and relative impulse under the forefoot 30 min after running. Further supporting this, Weist et al. [26] observed increased maximal force (5%, p < 0.01), peak pressure (12%, p < 0.001), and impulse (9%, p < 0.01) under the second and third metatarsal heads and the medial midfoot towards the end of a fatiguing run. They also highlighted a significant increase in pressure under the medial midfoot. Inconsistencies regarding the effects of fatigue on different foot regions have been noted, particularly concerning the heel, midfoot, and toes [23]. Some studies did not find significant changes in peak pressures due to running [25]. It is worth noting that fatigue may impact the biomechanical pattern of running differently on a treadmill compared to overground, given the distinct muscle activity patterns and specific neuromuscular control mechanisms for each surface [66]. Interestingly, several studies reported reduced peak pressures across various foot zones, with significant differences observed in the whole foot and lateral heel and a slight trend in the hallux [2]. This reduction could be attributed to runners adapting their running kinematics to sustain fatigued performance [30]. Additionally, certain studies indicated a decrease in peak pressures under the toes and an increase in the metatarsal area, suggesting that local fatigue of the toe flexors might drive this pressure shift [23,25,67]. Despite no metatarsal overload, Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez et al. [2] observed a significant reduction in peak pressure under the lateral heel and hallux. This alteration in the \u201croll-over process\u201d due to fatigue could explain the observed change in plantar pressure distribution [2]. Consistent with these findings, previous studies have also reported decreased peak pressures under the hallux and heel due to fatigue [22,67]. This behavior, coupled with the observed load increase under the medial heel by Willems et al. [23], might indicate greater foot pronation resulting from local muscular fatigue, particularly fatigue of the tibialis posterior, known to exhibit fatigue during running motion [22,23].\nSports 2023, 11, 241 22 of 27\nThe noted increase in foot pronation resulting from fatigue could potentially elevate the risk of injuries, a common occurrence among runners. During the forefoot push-off phase, there was a notable shift towards a more lateral pressure distribution. However, inconsistencies were observed regarding the effects of fatigue on the heel, midfoot, and toes [23]. Nevertheless, there is a consensus regarding the fatigue-induced escalation of forefoot loading. Multiple studies have demonstrated rises in peak pressures and impulses under the metatarsals [21,22,26,67]. A study by [67] described a reduction in pressure under the toes post-marathon race, while another study by [26] found no differences. Weist et al. [26] reported a notable rise in pressure under the medial midfoot. Conversely, Alfuth et al. [21] observed decreased peak pressure and relative impulses under the midfoot after 30 min of intensive running. Moreover, Weist et al. [26] found increased impulse underneath the medial heel, contrasting with studies such as those by [6,22], which indicated a decrease in rearfoot loading following a fatiguing run. Additionally, Bisiaux et al. [21] found significant reductions in peak pressures and relative impulses under the heel after 30 min of intensive running. The tibialis posterior muscle is crucial for controlling rearfoot eversion and providing dynamic support across the midfoot and forefoot during the stance phase of gait [68,69]. Noteworthy changes were observed, including significant increases in peak force (12.4%), mean force (11.9%), and impulse (17.6%), coupled with a general increase in metatarsal loading [23]. Fatigue in runners leads to a higher relative load on the medial arch and a decrease in peak pressure under the lateral heel and hallux [2]. However, forces beneath the lateral heel did not show significant differences [2]. Within the midfoot region, there was no\nTable 11.7% increase in impulse (p = 0.021), while peak force and mean force significantly decreased beneath toes two to five by 8.1% and 7.2%, respectively. Forces under the hallux did not demonstrate significant differences [56,65]. Weist et al. [26] showcased a significant increase in impulse under the medial heel, although peak and mean forces did not experience significant changes. They also observed a substantial increase in loading under the midfoot and medial heel. Willems et al. [23] reported heightened loading under the medial midfoot, impulse under the medial heel, and peak and mean force after a 20 km race.\nFollowing local muscle fatigue in the meta-analysis, our findings indicate an insignificant reduction in maximum pressure. Other studies also reported diminished pressure values [2,21,23]. This result supports the hypothesis proposing a potential strategy to reduce the risk of fatigue injuries [10]. It is attributed to several factors, including decreased vertical movement of the body\u2019s center of gravity, reduced muscle stiffness, enhanced shock absorption due to increased knee joint flexion [36], and a flattened foot arch caused by dorsiflexion fatigue [17]. These factors collectively contribute to a reduction in landing pressure. Moreover, as the running speed remained constant with no alterations in stride frequency or length, the load on the forefoot decreased, further diminishing muscular fatigue during running. Furthermore, it is essential to consider the duration for which this compensatory mechanism remains effective without impacting running speed and its applicability within the limited time frame of our treadmill-based studies, which typically last only 60 s. Elevated pressure values beneath the heel point cause increased muscle stiffness and reduced compliance during foot strikes, leading to a greater load on the heel of the more powerful leg. However, it is important to note that these findings exhibited only a small effect size and lost statistical significance after adjusting for multiple comparisons (P adjustment). The fatigue protocol revealed that the dorsiflexor muscles displayed a notably higher level of fatigue when compared to the plantar flexors, thereby exerting an impact on the muscular control of the ankle. One reason for this emerging muscular imbalance can be attributed to the greater strength of the plantar flexors, owing to their larger muscle mass and distinct roles in running and walking. Running places more stress on the plantar flexors, enhancing their fatigue resistance over time. EMG analyses reveal that fatigue alters the neuromuscular relationship in movement control, impacting rolling\nSports 2023, 11, 241 23 of 27\nbehavior and plantar pressure distribution in foot movement [41]. Surprisingly, weaker dorsiflexors following fatigue did not correlate with a higher plantar pressure load but resulted in reduced plantar pressure under the heel. This decrease in heel pressure might be attributed to the weakened support function of the dorsiflexors when flattening the foot and attaching it to the ground, potentially coupled with increased flexion in the knee joint [70]. These alterations in load distribution affect various aspects of the foot, ankle, knee joint, and stabilizing muscles. Notably, there is a stress reduction, at least for the foot, supporting adopting a protective strategy to mitigate fatigue-related injuries. Nonetheless, it is important to consider the treadmill load protocol, which involved short running durations of approximately 1 min per running speed and required subjects to maintain increased attention and focus. This approach led to a reduction in stress, which was more pronounced at the examined running speeds. Interestingly, even after local muscle fatigue at the same running speed, no significant changes were observed in stride frequency or stride length, aligning with the findings by Alfuth and Rosenbaum [25], who also reported no alterations in determined step frequency [25]. Additionally, Willems et al. [23] observed that following a 20 km race, the first contact time of the metatarsal occurred earlier, and the total foot contact time was significantly longer. In a separate study, Weist et al. [26] noted only minimal effects on contact area and contact time, alongside a decrease in step time, as reported [22]. Some studies also indicated an increase in flight time with fatigue [57,58,65], which aligns with the findings by Mizrahi et al. [41]. Previous research consistently indicates an increase in the kinetic variable time with fatigue and after experiencing muscular fatigue [43,51,57,58]. These findings align with those of [15,17], illustrating well-documented kinetic changes following fatigue in both healthy and injured runners. However, two additional studies [71,72] suggest differences in both kinematics and kinetics between treadmill and overground locomotion. Another study by Brown et al. [61] found no interaction between fatigue and limb dominance when examining joint kinematics or kinetics. Consequently, fatigue may accentuate the kinematic and kinetic differences between limbs. Moreover, muscular fatigue has been linked to delayed muscle activation and subsequent kinematic and kinetic alterations in the running stride [43]. Based on this research, using different fatigue protocols leads to different results. Thus, we cannot compare the results of different studies except in the case of a standard muscle fatigue protocol for the knee and ankle joint through which experiments are conducted; thus, comparisons can be made between those results.\nLimitations\nThe treadmill studies are subjected to the disadvantage of unfamiliar conditions affecting the running movement, but the laboratory situation simplifies the control of disturbances and data collection. Another limitation is the plantar pressure measurement, which only included the vertical force registered with lower measurement accuracy than force plates but averaged several running cycles over a duration of 30 s. Using the manufacturer\u2019s software, a reduction to three-foot zones without separating the toes of the medial and lateral foot is restricted to comparability with other studies. The fundamental relationship between the movement technique of the lower extremities and plantar pressure distribution is still not fully understood or has yet to be established. The observed trend of forefoot strikes during barefoot running on the treadmill suggests that some individuals classified as forefoot runners may not consistently maintain this foot strike pattern when wearing running shoes; this highlights the importance of considering footwear in foot strike pattern analysis. Additionally, the exclusive focus on male participants in the conducted experiments underlines the necessity for further research involving groups of women. Comparative studies between genders can provide a more comprehensive understanding of potential variations in foot strike patterns based on gender. Regarding research methodology, this study relied solely on cross-sectional\nSports 2023, 11, 241 24 of 27\nstudies. However, incorporating diverse study designs, such as cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-over studies, and randomized controlled trials, can provide a more robust and comprehensive analysis of foot strike patterns and their implications. Diversifying the study designs can enhance the reliability and generalizability of the findings in this area of research."

A deficiency in the procedure for assessing local muscle fatigue of the knee joint muscles was found. Therefore, it is recommended to use a standard protocol of local muscle fatigue for knee and ankle joints to compare results from different studies. In addition to running, strength training of the foot muscles with a specific focus on the dorsiflexor muscles should be done to prevent running-related injuries. One of the future targets should be applying these experiments while wearing shoes, which is the main running method. The foot strike patterns should be varied for injury prevention to relieve the foot area under the heel. To get a better analysis of the plantar pressure values, it is recommended to check the kinematic parameters of the angles of the knee joint, ankle, and sole for a better understanding of the relationship between the plantar pressure distribution and the movement of the lower limbs.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/sports11120241/s1, PRISMA checklist as the supplementary materials\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, W.A.H., L.H., M.A.K. and K.M.; methodology, W.A.H., L.H., M.A.K. and K.M.; software, W.A.H., L.H., M.A.K. and K.M.; validation, W.A.H., L.H., M.A.K. and K.M.; formal analysis, W.A.H., L.H., M.A.K. and K.M.; investigation, W.A.H., L.H., M.A.K. and K.M.; resources, W.A.H., L.H., M.A.K. and K.M.; data curation, W.A.H., L.H., M.A.K. and K.M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, W.A.H., L.H., M.A.K. and K.M.; writing\u2014review and editing W.A.H., L.H., M.A.K. and K.M.; visualization, W.A.H., L.H., M.A.K. and K.M.; supervision, W.A.H., L.H., M.A.K. and K.M.; project administration, W.A.H., L.H., M.A.K. and K.M.
