1. **Investigate the effects of biochar on the microbial community in saline alkali soil.** How does biochar application affect the composition and diversity of soil microorganisms? Do these changes in the microbial community contribute to the observed improvements in soil properties and plant growth?


2. **Explore the potential of biochar to reduce fertilizer leaching in other soil types.** The current study was conducted in saline alkali soil. It would be valuable to investigate whether biochar can also reduce fertilizer leaching in other soil types, such as sandy soils or clay soils.


3. **Evaluate the long-term effects of biochar application on soil fertility and plant growth.** The current study only examined the effects of biochar application over a period of 90 days. It would be beneficial to conduct long-term studies to assess the sustainability of the observed improvements in soil fertility and plant growth.


4. **Investigate the mechanisms by which biochar reduces fertilizer leaching.** The current study provides evidence that biochar can reduce fertilizer leaching, but the mechanisms responsible for this effect are not fully understood. Future research should focus on elucidating the mechanisms by which biochar reduces fertilizer leaching, such as adsorption, ion exchange, or changes in soil structure.


5. **Develop practical strategies for incorporating biochar into agricultural practices.** To promote the widespread adoption of biochar as a soil amendment, it is important to develop practical strategies for incorporating biochar into agricultural practices. This may involve developing new application methods, optimizing biochar production processes, or identifying suitable biochar sources.
