    "abstractText": "This paper considers the Cauchy problem for the nonlinear dynamic string equation of Kirchhoff-type with time-varying coefficients. The objective of this work is to develop a time domain discretization algorithm capable of approximating a solution to this initial-boundary value problem. To this end, a symmetric three-layer semi-discrete scheme is employed with respect to the temporal variable, wherein the value of a nonlinear term is evaluated at the middle node point. This approach enables the numerical solutions per temporal step to be obtained by inverting the linear operators, yielding a system of second-order linear ordinary differential equations. Local convergence of the proposed scheme is established, and it achieves quadratic convergence regarding the step size of the discretization of time on the local temporal interval. We have conducted several numerical experiments using the proposed algorithm for various test problems to validate its performance. It can be said that the obtained numerical results are in accordance with the theoretical findings.",

            "text": "The nonlinear dynamic Kirchhoff string equation is a hyperbolic partial differential equation that accurately models the behaviour of an elastic string of length \u2113,\nutt (x, t) = \u03b1+ \u03b2 \u2113\u222b 0 u2x (x, t) dx uxx (x, t) , \u03b1 > 0 , \u03b2 > 0 . (K) This equation (K) was first derived by the prominent German physicist Gustav Kirchhoff in the mid-nineteenth century (see [18]). It serves as a prototypical example of a nonlinear wave equation, formulated as an extension of d\u2019Alembert\u2019s wave equation for free vibrations of elastic strings. It considers factors such as tension, as well as external forces like gravity and air resistance. The solution of the equation provides the displacement of the string at any given point in time, and its application extends to a multitude of physical systems.\nHere, in the context of the equation (1.1a), u (x, t) represents the displacement of the string from its equilibrium position at a specific point x and t. The external force density is denoted by f (x, t), while the tension in the string is expressed as \u03b1 (t) + \u03b2 (t) \u222b \u2113 0 u 2 x (x, t) dx. This tension includes material parameters \u03b1 (t) and \u03b2 (t), which may exhibit time dependence in our model. Notably, the key feature of the nonlinear Kirchhoff equation is that the tension is not constant and it varies nonlinearly with the spatial gradient of u (x, t), reflecting variations in the tension due to geometric bending. The quantity \u03b1 (t) represents the base tension of the string unaffected by displacement, while \u03b2 (t) scales the nonlinear contribution to the tension.\nUnder the assumption of time-independent material parameters, the range of applications spans from the classical representation of oscillations of thin beams, as originally formulated by Kirchhoff [18], to contemporary developments in the realm of nanomechanical oscillators [43]. Here, micro- or nanomechanical oscillators serve as building blocks for quantum transducers [19], for ultra-precise sensing devices [42], or as central elements in state-of-the-art quantum optics experiments with important examples being optomechanical quantum teleportation [13] and laser cooling [6].\nAllowing the material parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 to become time-dependent enriches the dynamics and paves the way for numerous important applications. If \u03b1 and \u03b2 are oscillating, they can describe vibrating systems where the vibration has a time-dependent influence on the material properties. Such oscillations might arise in classical applications when strings or cables are exposed to oscillating tensions from the operational vibrations of some machinery. In the case of nanomechanical devices, they can arise due to thermal vibrations or periodic excitations of the oscillator [36]. Furthermore, they can appear in quantum transducers, when the driving forces are strong enough to alter the material properties of an oscillator [39]. Time-varying material constants also allow for the description of environmental changes such as temperature, pressure, or humidity. They could furthermore be used to model beams made out of smart materials whose properties can be modified in response to external events, e.g. in order to better withstand earthquakes [38]."

            "text": "Despite its antiquity, the Kirchhoff dynamic string equation remains a valuable tool in the study of wave motion and is extensively used in the fields of physics, engineering, and related sciences. Numerous\ndistinguished scientists have contributed to the study of the equation and its various modifications. However, obtaining an exact solution to the equation remains a challenging problem, and numerical methods are commonly employed to approximate the solution. The equation has been extensively investigated using both numerical and analytical methods.\nThe conditions governing the existence of solutions for equation (K) were first examined by S. Bernstein in 1940 [4]. Bernstein\u2019s work focused on the scenario where the initial data are 2\u03c0-periodic analytic functions on R. Poho\u017eaev extended Bernstein\u2019s results in 1975 [29] to encompass the multidimensional case regarding spatial variables. In 1978, Lions presented an abstract framework for the Kirchhoff equation (K) in a publication that significantly contributed to its popularity [20]. Since then, many researchers have studied the solvability issues of the classical and modified Kirchhoff static and dynamic equations in general function spaces and developed a qualitative approach. These scholars include Alves, Corr\u00eaa, and Ma [1]; Arosio and Panizzi [2]; Berselli and Manfrin [5]; D\u2019Ancona and Spagnolo [8, 9, 10]; Greenberg and Hu [14]; Kajitani [17]; Liu and Rincon [21]; Ma [22]; Manfrin [23]; Matos [24]; Medeiros [25]; Nishihara [26]; and Rzymowski [35].\nOver the years, many numerical methods have been developed to address the boundary and initialboundary value problems arising from both the classical and modified Kirchhoff\u2019s string equations. These methods encompass a variety of techniques, including but not limited to finite difference, spectral, and finite element methods. Moreover, several of these methods have been combined with other numerical schemes, resulting in even more sophisticated approaches. Christie and Sanz-Serna [7] applied the finite element method to discretize the Kirchhoff equation (K). They utilized predictor-corrector methods based on Crank-Nicolson-type schemes for time integration. Gudi [15] investigated a finite element method for a second-order nonlinear elliptic boundary value problem of the stationary version of the generalized Kirchhoff equation. Here, the finite element system is replaced with an equivalent sparse system for which the Jacobian of the Newton-Raphson iterative method is sparse. Liu and Rincon [21] solved the Kirchhoff equation for nonlinear elastic strings with moving boundaries using the explicit Lax-Friedrichs difference scheme. Peradze [27] developed an algorithm for the numerical solution of the dynamic Kirchhoff string equation, which utilizes the Galerkin method, the modified Crank-Nicolson difference scheme, and a Picard-type iteration process. In [28], Peradze proposed a numerical algorithm based on the projection method and the finite difference method for approximating the Kirchhoff wave equation with respect to spatial and time variables. In [30], Q. Ren and H. Tian developed a numerical scheme for obtaining an approximate solution to a nonlocal stationary analogue of the Kirchhoff equation using the Legendre-Galerkin spectral method, which reduces the problem to a nonlinear finite-dimensional system, followed by an iterative solution. In all of the works considered, numerical algorithms are designed to combine the reduction of the original problem to a finite-dimensional system of nonlinear equations with an iterative process for finding an approximate solution to the obtained system.\nThe works authored by J. Rogava and M. Tsiklauri [31, 32] are primarily concerned with the development and analysis of a symmetric three-layer semi-discrete scheme for solving the Cauchy problem associated with the abstract generalization of the dynamic Kirchhoff equation. In the proposed scheme, the value of a nonlinear term is evaluated at the middle node point, resulting in the transformation of the original problem into a linear one for each temporal layer. In [40, 41], the same approach is extended through the combination of the Legendre-Galerkin spectral method for numerically solving the spatial one-dimensional nonlinear dynamic Kirchhoff string equation. This choice leads to the reduction of the stated nonlinear problem to a system of linear equations per temporal layer, with the corresponding coefficient matrix being sparse and featuring nonzero elements exclusively on the main diagonal, the second diagonal below it, and the second diagonal above it. In the article [34], a semi-discrete scheme is considered for an abstract analogue of the J. Ball beam integro-differential equation, regarding the general nonlinear case. The stability and convergence of this scheme are studied. The book authored by T. Jangveladze, Z. Kiguradze, and B. Neta [16] addresses the design of algorithms for finding numerical solutions and conducting investigations regarding initial-boundary value problems for specific classes of integro-differential equations."

Our objective is to obtain an approximate solution for this problem by employing a symmetric three-layer semi-discrete scheme with respect to the temporal variable. Notably, in this scheme, the nonlinear term is taken at the middle node point (cf. [31, 32, 40, 41]). By applying this approach, the stated hyperbolic nonlinear partial differential equation can be reduced to a system of linear ordinary differential equations of second order. We complete an investigation into the convergence of the proposed semi-discrete scheme for approximating the solution to the problem.\nOur research demonstrates that the considered scheme attains quadratic convergence regarding the step size of the discretization of time on the local temporal interval.\nFrom the standpoint of numerical implementation, a fourth-order accuracy finite-difference scheme is developed regarding the spatial variable, resulting in obtaining a tridiagonal system of linear equations at each time step. Furthermore, the coefficient matrices of these systems reveal strict diagonal dominance. The condition numbers of the coefficient matrices of these tridiagonal systems are estimated. Based on this estimate, a relation between the lengths of spatial and temporal grids is established, ensuring that the condition numbers remain within the practically accepted range. To validate the efficacy of the scheme, we subjected it to four carefully chosen test problems. In the first three tests, exact solutions are known, exhibiting oscillatory behaviour. Numerical experiments show that the order of convergence of the scheme aligns with the theoretical results. The proposed algorithm accurately describes the behaviour of the oscillating solutions. Notably, In the fourth test, we consider a homogeneous version of the Kirchhoff string equation (1.1a) with fixed coefficients and an unknown analytical solution. However, we propose an approach that allows us to find an experimental solution to this test problem. All results and numerical computations are detailed in the final section. Furthermore, the source code for the proposed algorithm, implemented in GNU Octave, is available in the GitHub repository and on Zenodo (see [33])."

[11, 12]), and we present one such version. Lemma 3.1 (Discrete Gr\u00f6nwall-type inequality).

Before proceeding to the proof, it is advisable to note that \u03b1i,k = \u03b1i,i \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03b1k,k = \u03b1i,j\u03b1j+1,k, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 k \u2212 1. The validity of the statement (3.2) for k = 0 is self-evident. This follows from (3.1), which provides evidence for the assertion that \u03b51 \u2264 h0.\nUsing (3.1) for k = 1, the following inequality can be derived through the application of the previously established inequality \u03b52 \u2264 a1\u03b51 + h0 + h1 \u2264 (1 + a1)h0 + h1 = \u03b11,1h0 + h1 .

The sequences of functions L1/2 (uk (x) \u2212 uk\u22121 (x)) /\u03c4 and Luk (x) are locally uniformly bounded with respect to the L2-norm, i.e., there exists T > 0 such that\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225L1/2uk \u2212 uk\u22121\u03c4 \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u2264 M3 , \u2225Luk\u2225 \u2264 M4 , k = 1, 2, . . . , [T\u03c4 ] .\nHere, M3 and M4 are positive constants that depend on the value of T .\nProof. Let us consider taking the inner product of both sides of the equation (2.10) with L (uk+1 \u2212 uk\u22121) = L (\u2206uk) + L (\u2206uk\u22121).

Substituting the notations introduced in the previous step and using the inequality (3.10), we can rewrite the equality (3.9) as follows\n\u00b5\u0303k+1 + 1 2 (\u03b1k + \u03b2k\u03b3k) \u03bdk+1 \u2264 \u00b5\u0303k + 1 2 (\u03b1k + \u03b2k\u03b3k) \u03bdk\u22121 + \u03c4\u03c3k\n(\u221a \u00b5\u0303k + \u221a \u00b5\u0303k+1 ) .\nContinuing from the previous step, using the notation \u03bd\u0303k = 1 2 (\u03bdk\u22121 + \u03bdk), we have\n\u00b5\u0303k+1 + (\u03b1k + \u03b2k\u03b3k) \u03bd\u0303k+1 \u2264 \u00b5\u0303k + (\u03b1k + \u03b2k\u03b3k) \u03bd\u0303k + \u03c4\u03c3k (\u221a \u00b5\u0303k + \u221a \u00b5\u0303k+1 ) .\nExpanding the inequality in the previous step, we obtain \u00b5\u0303k+1 + (\u03b1k + \u03b2k\u03b3k) \u03bd\u0303k+1 \u2264 \u00b5\u0303k + (\u03b1k\u22121 + \u03b2k\u22121\u03b3k\u22121) \u03bd\u0303k\n+ (\u03b1k \u2212 \u03b1k\u22121) \u03bd\u0303k + (\u03b2k\u03b3k \u2212 \u03b2k\u22121\u03b3k\u22121) \u03bd\u0303k + \u03c4\u03c3k (\u221a \u00b5\u0303k + \u221a \u00b5\u0303k+1 ) . (3.11)\nEvaluating the absolute value of the following difference \u03b3k \u2212 \u03b3k\u22121 by virtue of the Lemma 3.4 |\u03b3k \u2212 \u03b3k\u22121| \u2264 (\u221a \u03b3k\u22121 + \u221a \u03b3k ) \u03c4 \u221a \u00b5\u0303k \u2264 2M2\u03c4 \u221a \u00b5\u0303k .

The coefficient of\ntk can be explicitly estimated using data from the problem (1.1a)-(1.1c), taking into account the value of T as well. Furthermore, the inequality \u03bb\u0303 \u2264 M\u0303 holds, where M\u0303 is a positive constant that depends on \u2225\u2225L2\u03c80\u2225\u2225, \u2225L\u03c81\u2225, \u2225Lf0\u2225, and the value of T .\nFrom (3.22), the following inequality follows:\n\u03bb\u0303k \u2264 M\u0303( 1 \u2212 MT )2 ec19T , k = 1, 2, . . . , [T\u03c4 ] , (3.23)\nwhere M = c18 \u221a\nM\u0303, T = q M , 0 < q < 1.\nThe inequality given in (3.23) implies that the sequences of functions L1/2 (uk (x) \u2212 uk\u22121 (x)) /\u03c4 and Luk (x) are uniformly bounded over the local interval [ 0, T ] .\nRemark 3.6.

            "text": "It should be noted that throughout the text, the index t is occasionally omitted in expressing the derivative of the function u (x, t) with respect to the temporal variable t. Specifically, the notation u\u2032 (x, t) is used to represent the first-order derivative of the function u (x, t) with respect to its second argument, rather than u\u2032t (x, t) or ut (x, t). When mixed partial derivatives of the function u (x, t) with respect to the spatial and the temporal variables are encountered, lower indices x and t are used to denote the appropriate partial derivatives. For instance, uxxt (x, t) represents the second-order and the first-order partial derivatives of the function u (x, t) with respect to the spatial and the temporal variables, respectively.\nBefore presenting the theorem on the convergence of the scheme (2.2), we first provide a remark on the smoothness of the solution to problem (1.1a)-(1.1c) to ascertain the order of convergence of the proposed symmetric three-layer semi-discrete scheme (2.2). To ensure the well-posedness of the problem, a minimum degree of smoothness of the solution is required, which guarantees convergence but is insufficient to determine the order of convergence. By raising the smoothness of the solution by one degree, the order of convergence becomes equal to one (specifically, in both the previous and current scenarios, where u1 (x) = \u03c80 (x) + \u03c4\u03c81 (x) is sufficient). Furthermore, if the smoothness degree is risen by two and the initial function is specified using formula (2.7), the order of convergence is improved by an additional degree, resulting in a total order of two. However, further increasing the smoothness degree would be superfluous, as the approximation order of scheme (2.2) does not exceed two.\nThe subsequent theorem is established regarding the convergence of the scheme (2.2). Theorem 3.7. Let the problem (1.1a)-(1.1c) be well-posed. Besides, the following conditions are fulfilled:\n(a) \u03c80 (x) \u2208 D (L0), \u03c81 (x) \u2208 C1 ([0, \u2113]) and the function ux (x, t) has a second-order continuous derivative with respect to the temporal variable.\n(b) The solution u (x, t) of the problem (1.1a)-(1.1c) is a continuously differentiable function up to and including the third order with respect to the temporal variable, moreover, u\u2032\u2032\u2032 (x, t) is a Lipschitz continuous function with respect to the temporal variable.\n(c) The function uxx (x, t) is continuously differentiable with respect to the temporal variable, as well uxxt (x, t) satisfies the Lipschitz condition with respect to the temporal variable.\nThen there exists T ( 0 < T \u2264 T ) such that for the error of an approximate solution denoted by zk (x) and defined as follows zk (x) = u (x, tk) \u2212 uk (x) the following estimates hold:\nmax 1\u2264k\u2264m \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225dzkdx \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u2264 M5\u03c42 , max0\u2264k\u2264m\u22121 \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225zk+1 \u2212 zk\u03c4 \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u2264 M6\u03c42 ,\nwhere m = [ T\n\u03c4\n] .\nProof. If we evaluate the exact representation of equation (1.1a) at t = tk, which is expressed as equality (2.1), and subtract it from equation (2.2), evidently for zk (x) we obtain\n\u22062zk\u22121 (x) \u03c42 \u2212 12qk ( d2zk+1 (x) dx2 + d2zk\u22121 (x) dx2 ) = gk (x) , k = 1, 2, . . . , n\u2212 1 , (3.24)\nhere \u2206zk (x) = zk+1 (x) \u2212 zk (x) ,\ngk (x) = 1 2 (q (tk) \u2212 qk)\n( d2u (x, tk+1)\ndx2 + d2u (x, tk\u22121) dx2\n) +Rk (x, \u03c4) ,\nRk (x, \u03c4) = R1,k (x, \u03c4) +R2,k (x, \u03c4) = (\n\u22062u (x, tk\u22121) \u03c42 \u2212 \u2202 2u (x, tk) \u2202t2 ) \ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nR1,k(x,\u03c4)\n+ (\n\u221212q (tk) d2 dx2 \u2206 2u (x, tk\u22121) ) \ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nR2,k(x,\u03c4)\n.\nWe shall proceed to estimate the remainder term Rk (x, \u03c4) in equation (3.24). To do so, we consider the Taylor expansion of the function u (x, t) around the point t = tk. Specifically, we have\nu (x, t) = u (x, tk) + (t\u2212 tk)u\u2032 (x, tk) + (t\u2212 tk)2\n2 u \u2032\u2032 (x, tk) + (t\u2212 tk)3 6 u \u2032\u2032\u2032 (x, tk) + R\u03033 (x, t) . (3.25)\nIn this context, the remainder term R\u03033 (x, t), also known as the Lagrange remainder, is given by\nR\u03033 (x, t) = t\u222b\ntk s1\u222b tk s2\u222b tk (u\u2032\u2032\u2032 (x, s3) \u2212 u\u2032\u2032\u2032 (x, tk))ds3ds2ds1 .\nBy virtue of condition (b) in Theorem 3.7, it can be simply conclude that\nmax 0\u2264x\u2264\u2113 \u2223\u2223\u2223R\u03033 (x, t)\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 c2024 (t\u2212 tk)4 . (3.26) Upon substituting t = tk\u22121 and t = tk+1 in equality (3.25), we obtain the following result\n\u22062u (x, tk\u22121) \u03c42 \u2212 \u2202 2u (x, tk) \u2202t2 = 1 \u03c42\n( R\u03033 (x, tk\u22121) + R\u03033 (x, tk+1) ) ,\nand from here by taking into account inequality (3.26), we obtain the following estimate\nmax 0\u2264x\u2264\u2113 |R1,k (x, \u03c4)| = max 0\u2264x\u2264\u2113 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22062u (x, tk\u22121)\u03c42 \u2212 \u22022u (x, tk)\u2202t2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = 1\u03c42 max0\u2264x\u2264\u2113 \u2223\u2223\u2223R\u03033 (x, tk\u22121) + R\u03033 (x, tk+1)\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u2264 1 \u03c42\n( max\n0\u2264x\u2264\u2113 \u2223\u2223\u2223R\u03033 (x, tk\u22121)\u2223\u2223\u2223+ max 0\u2264x\u2264\u2113 \u2223\u2223\u2223R\u03033 (x, tk+1)\u2223\u2223\u2223) \u2264 c2012 \u03c42 .

From (3.47) by applying Lemma 3.1 (Discrete Gr\u00f6nwall-type inequality) along with Remark 3.2 we get\n\u03bbk+1 \u2264 ec\u0303tk \u03b1\u0303 \u2264 ec\u0303T \u03b1\u0303 . (3.48) To estimate \u03b1\u0303, we need to first estimate \u03bb1. For this purpose, we use conditions (a) and (b) of Theorem 3.7, and consider the Taylor expansion of the function u (x, t1) around the point t = 0 with respect to the temporal variable, keeping the first three terms. We then apply equation (1.1a) and the initial conditions (1.1b) for the functions u (x, 0), u\u2032 (x, 0) and u\u2032\u2032 (x, 0), which gives us\nu (x, t1) = u (x, 0) + t1u\u2032 (x, 0) + t21 2 u \u2032\u2032 (x, 0) + R\u03032 (x, t1)\n= \u03c80 (x) + \u03c4\u03c81 (x) + \u03c42\n2 \u03c82 (x) + R\u03032 (x, \u03c4) ,\nwhere\n\u03c82 (x) = f0 (x) + q0 d2\u03c80 (x) dx2 , R\u03032 (x, \u03c4) = 1 2 \u03c4\u222b 0 (\u03c4 \u2212 t)2u\u2032\u2032\u2032 (x, t)dt ,\non the other hand, recall that\nu1 (x) = \u03c80 (x) + \u03c4\u03c81 (x) + \u03c42\n2 \u03c82 (x) .\nWe obtain the following estimation for z1 (x)\nmax 0\u2264x\u2264\u2113 |z1 (x)| = max 0\u2264x\u2264\u2113 |u (x, t1) \u2212 u1 (x)| = max 0\u2264x\u2264\u2113 \u2223\u2223\u2223R\u03032 (x, \u03c4)\u2223\u2223\u2223 = 12 max0\u2264x\u2264\u2113 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03c4\u222b\n0\n(\u03c4 \u2212 t)2u\u2032\u2032\u2032 (x, t)dt \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 12 max(x,t) |u\u2032\u2032\u2032 (x, t)| \u03c4\u222b\n0\n(\u03c4 \u2212 t)2dt\n= 16 max(x,t) |u \u2032\u2032\u2032 (x, t)| \u03c43 = c34\u03c43 ,\nfrom here, we find that\n\u2225z1\u22252 = \u2113\u222b\n0\n(u (x, t1) \u2212 u1 (x))2dx \u2264 \u2113c234\u03c46 . (3.49)\nIn order to obtain an estimation for \u03d121, we consider the Taylor series expansion of the function u (x, t1) about the point t = 0 with respect to the temporal variable, but this time we keep only the first two terms. Similar to before, we apply the initial conditions (1.1b) for the functions u (x, 0), u\u2032 (x, 0) to obtain the following expression, i.e.\nu (x, t1) = u (x, 0) + t1u\u2032 (x, 0) + R\u03031 (x, t1)\n= \u03c80 (x) + \u03c4\u03c81 (x) + R\u03031 (x, \u03c4) ,\nhere\nR\u03031 (x, \u03c4) = \u03c4\u222b\n0\n(\u03c4 \u2212 t)u\u2032\u2032 (x, t)dt .\nIt should be noted that u1 (x) is an approximation of u (x, t1), i.e. u (x, t1) \u2248 u1 (x) = \u03c80 (x) + \u03c4\u03c81 (x).\nmax 0\u2264x\u2264\u2113 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223dz1 (x)dx \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = max0\u2264x\u2264\u2113 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 ddx (u (x, t1) \u2212 u1 (x)) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = max0\u2264x\u2264\u2113 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 ddxR\u03031 (x, \u03c4) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n= max 0\u2264x\u2264\u2113 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 ddx \u03c4\u222b\n0\n(\u03c4 \u2212 t)u\u2032\u2032 (x, t)dt \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 max(x,t) |uxtt (x, t)| \u03c4\u222b\n0\n(\u03c4 \u2212 t)dt\n\u2264 12 max(x,t) |uxtt (x, t)|\u03c4 2 = c35\u03c42 ,\nfrom here, we obtain \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225dz1dx \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 = \u2113\u222b 0 [ d dx (u (x, t1) \u2212 u1 (x)) ]2 dx \u2264 \u2113c235\u03c44 . (3.50)\nBased on (3.49) and (3.50), we can derive the following estimations\n\u03bb1 = \u00b521 + 1 2 ( \u03b10 + \u03b20\u03d120 ) \u03d1 2 1\n= \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225z1 \u2212 z0\u03c4 \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 + 12 ( \u03b10 + \u03b20 \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225du0dx \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 )\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225dz1dx \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 = 1 \u03c42 \u2225z1\u22252 + 1 2 ( \u03b10 + \u03b20 \u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225d\u03c80dx \u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 )\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225dz1dx\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252 \u2264 \u2113 ( c234 + 1 2 ( \u03b10 + \u03b20c236 ) c235 ) \u03c44 = c37\u03c44 , z0 (x) = u (x, 0) \u2212 u0 (x) \u2261 0 , (3.51)\nfurthermore, it can be concluded from equation (3.51) that\n\u03b1\u0303 = \u03b11 \u2212 c33\u03c4 = 11 \u2212 c33\u03c4\n( \u03bb1 + 1 2 ( \u03b11 + \u03b21\u03d121 ) \u03d1 2 0 + c28T\u03c44 ) = 11 \u2212 c33\u03c4 ( \u03bb1 + c28T\u03c44 ) \u2264 c37 + c28T1 \u2212 c33\u03c4 \u03c44 = c38\u03c44 . (3.52)\nFrom (3.48), taking the inequalities (3.51) and (3.52) into consideration, the estimates for Theorem 3.7 are obtained.\nRemark 3.8. The error zk (x) = u (x, tk) \u2212 uk (x) of an approximate solution to the problem (1.1a)-(1.1c) is bounded by the following inequality:\nmax 1\u2264k\u2264m \u2225zk\u2225 \u2264 M7\u03c42 , (3.53)\nwhere m = [ T\n\u03c4\n] , and T satisfies 0 < T \u2264 T .\nThe validity of inequality (3.53) follows immediately from the identity\nzk (x) = z0 (x) + \u03c4 k\u22121\u2211 i=0 \u2206zi (x) \u03c4 , z0 (x) = u (x, 0) \u2212 u0 (x) \u2261 0 ,\nby virtue of the second bound of Theorem 3.7."

            "text": "This subsection outlines the development of a three-term difference scheme that attains fourth-order accuracy over an equidistant space grid of length h. The main motivation for constructing this scheme lies in the self-contained nature of our paper, wherein we seek to provide a comprehensive treatment of numerical methods for the problem at hand. Notably, the technique used in this scheme is widely known and has been previously discussed in various literature (e.g. see [3]). Although the primary focus of our research pertains to the development of the symmetric three-layer semi-discrete scheme regarding the temporal variable, we also employ a combination of this scheme with a spatial fourth-order accuracy three-term difference scheme to obtain numerical results. It should be emphasized that the article [31] explores the same approach.\nObserve that the symmetric three-layer semi-discrete scheme (2.2), used in numerical solutions of the problem (1.1a)-(1.1c), yields second-order linear ordinary differential equations per temporal layer. These differential equations are given by (2.4).\nBy introducing the notation\nA = I \u2212 12\u03c4 2qk d2 dx2 , with D (A) =\n{ u (x) \u2208 C2 ([0, \u2113]) | u (0) = u (\u2113) = 0 } ,\none can express equation (2.4) in the following manner\nAuk+1 (x) = \u03c42fk (x) + 2uk (x) \u2212 Auk\u22121 (x) . If the inverse of the operator A is applied to both sides of the preceding equation, the resulting expression can be obtained as follows\nuk+1 (x) = A\u22121vk (x) \u2212 uk\u22121 (x) , where vk (x) = \u03c42fk (x) + 2uk (x) . Denoting wk (x) = A\u22121vk (x), we have\nAwk (x) = vk (x) .\nBy setting the operator A = I \u2212 12\u03c4 2qk d2 dx2 in the above-mentioned equation, we can deduce that the resulting equation can be written in expanded form as follows w\u2032\u2032k (x) \u2212 pkwk (x) = v\u0303k (x) , (4.1)\nwhere pk = 2\n\u03c42qk and v\u0303k (x) = \u2212pkvk (x).\nTo obtain a fourth-order accuracy three-term difference scheme for the equations (4.1), we initially omit the temporal layer index k to simplify the derivation process. Upon deriving the scheme, we subsequently reintroduce the temporal layer index k into the equations. It should be noted that the resulting difference equations are dependent on two indices, namely k and i, where i represents the i-th node along the spatial grid.\nLet h denote the uniform spacing of a spatial grid defined over the domain [0, \u2113] with m + 1 equally spaced points. We define the partition of the domain as:\n0 = x0 < x1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < xm = \u2113, with xi = ih for i = 0, 1, . . . ,m; here, h = \u2113\nm .\nLet us consider the Taylor expansion of a function w (x) about a point x = xi, while maintaining the first six terms, i.e.\nw (x) = 5\u2211\nj=0\nw(j) (xi) j! (x\u2212 xi)\nj + O ( h6 ) .\nIf we substitute x = xi\u22121 and x = xi+1 into the Taylor expansion of the function w (x) centred at xi, then sum and rearrange the resulting expressions, we obtain\nw\u2032\u2032 (xi) = \u22062w (xi\u22121)\nh2 \u2212 h\n2\n12w (4) (xi) + O\n( h4 ) .\nConsider the equation (4.1) in the context of a set of points where x = xi. By substituting the last equality for w\u2032\u2032 (xi), the equation (4.1) can be reformulated as follows:\n\u22062w (xi\u22121) h2 \u2212 h 2 12w (4) (xi) \u2212 pw (xi) = v\u0303 (xi) + O\n( h4 ) .\nBy evaluating the second-order derivative of equation (4.1) at the points x = xi and determining w(4) (xi) = pw\u2032\u2032 (xi) + v\u0303\u2032\u2032 (xi) = p2w (xi) + pv\u0303 (xi) + v\u0303\u2032\u2032 (xi) ,\none can substitute the resulting value of w(4) (xi) into the previous equation to draw the following conclusion \u22062w (xi\u22121)\nh2 \u2212 p\n( 1 + h 2 12p ) w (xi) = ( 1 + h 2 12p ) v\u0303 (xi) + h2 12 v\u0303 \u2032\u2032 (xi) + O ( h4 ) .\nThrough the use of the central difference approximation with a second-order accuracy to approximate the second-order derivative of the function v\u0303 (x) at the discrete spatial grid points xi, an alternative formulation of the prior equation can be obtained with equivalent accuracy\n\u22062w (xi\u22121) h2\n\u2212 p ( 1 + h 2 12p ) w (xi) = 1 12 ( v\u0303 (xi+1) + ( 10 + h2p ) v\u0303 (xi) + v\u0303 (xi\u22121) ) + O ( h4 ) . (4.2)\nFor every temporal layer k, we define uk,i and wk,i to be the approximations of the unknown functions uk (x) and wk (x) at the discrete point xi, respectively. Specifically, we have uk (xi) \u2248 uk,i and wk (xi) \u2248 wk,i. Furthermore, we use fk,i, vk,i and v\u0303k,i to denote the values of the given functions fk (x), vk (x) and v\u0303k (x) at each point xi, respectively. It is noteworthy that vk,i \u2248 \u03c42fk,i + 2uk,i. Finally, the equation (4.2) can be rewritten as follows\nwk,i\u22121 + bkwk,i + wk,i+1 = \u03c6k,i , wk,0 = wk,m = 0 ,\n(4.3)\nwhere the values of bk and \u03c6k,i are given by: bk = \u22122 [ 1 + \u03b4 2\nqk\n( 1 + \u03b4 2\n6qk\n)] , \u03c6k,i = \u2212 \u03b42\n6qk\n( vk,i\u22121 + 2 ( 5 + \u03b4 2\nqk\n) vk,i + vk,i+1 ) , \u03b4 = h\n\u03c4 .\nThe problem defined by equations (2.4)-(2.5) can be approximated by computing solutions uk+1,i for k = 1, 2, . . . , n\u2212 1 and i = 1, 2, . . . ,m\u2212 1. These solutions can be obtained by substituting the solutions for wk,i and uk\u22121,i into the equation uk+1,i = wk,i \u2212 uk\u22121,i. To accomplish the desired objective, it is necessary to effectively solve the tridiagonal systems of linear equations in each discrete time step defined by (4.3), in which the coefficient matrices are characterized by strict diagonal dominance. Moreover, for each fixed layer, the coefficient matrices denoted as Bk \u2208 R(m\u22121)\u00d7(m\u22121) in system (4.3) are symmetric tridiagonal Toeplitz matrices. It is worth noting that there exist straightforward closed-form solutions for their eigenvalues (cf. [37]):\n\u03bbk,i = \u22122 [ 1 + \u03b4 2\nqk\n( 1 + \u03b4 2\n6qk\n) \u2212 cos ( i\u03c0\nm\n)] , i = 1, 2, . . . ,m\u2212 1 .\nOur focus is to determine the lower bound of the parameter \u03b4. To achieve this, we proceed by assessing the condition number of the matrix Bk, employing the matrix norm induced by the (vector) Euclidean norm, denoted as \u2225\u00b7\u22252, viz.\n\u03ba2 (Bk) = \u2225\u2225B\u22121k \u2225\u22252\u2225Bk\u22252 = max1\u2264i\u2264m\u22121 |\u03bbk,i|min\n1\u2264i\u2264m\u22121 |\u03bbk,i|\n= 1 + 2 cos\n( \u03c0 m ) 1 + \u03b4 2\nqk\n( 1 + \u03b4 2\n6qk\n) \u2212 cos ( \u03c0 m ) \u2264 1 + 2\n\u03b42\nqk\n( 1 + \u03b4 2\n6qk ) \u2264 1 + \u03b5 , \u03b5 > 0 , m \u2265 2 . (4.4) It should be noted that an identical estimate can be readily obtained for the condition numbers of the matrix Bk by involving matrix norms induced by the vector 1-norm and the vector \u221e-norm, correspondingly.\nFrom the given inequality (4.4), we can derive the following result\n\u03b4 \u2265 \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221aqk(\u221a9 + 12 \u03b5 \u2212 3 ) .\nIn conclusion, by further strengthening the above-stated inequality and considering the condition qk > c0 > 0, one can infer that\n\u03b4 = h \u03c4 \u2265 max 1\u2264k\u2264n\u22121 \u221a 2qk \u03b5 > \u221a 2c0 \u03b5 .\nSince the value of qk depends on an unknown function, it becomes necessary to specify h and \u03c4 in accordance with the condition \u03b4 > \u221a 2c0 \u03b5 . This strategic choice of spacing of spatial and temporal grids guarantees in a certain way that the condition numbers of the coefficient matrices Bk for the tridiagonal systems (4.3) fall within a favourable range for efficient computational purposes.\nIn order to determine the values of the initial conditions (2.6) and (2.7) at each spatial node xi, i = 1, 2, . . . ,m\u2212 1, we evaluate the values of the given function \u03c80 (x) at each point xi to obtain the initial condition u0,i, where u0,i = \u03c80 (xi). For the first temporal layer, we compute the values of all given functions in (2.7) at the points xi, denoting them with lower indices k and i regarding the original functions. To approximate the second-order derivative of the function \u03c80 (x) with respect to the spatial variable at the points xi, we use the central finite difference scheme with fourth-order accuracy, where the uniform grid spacing h is halved to ensure that we remain within the spatial interval [0, \u2113]. Specifically,\n\u03c8\u03030,i = \u03c8\u2032\u20320 (xi) \u2248 \u2212\u03c80 (xi\u22121) + 16\u03c80\n( xi\u22121/2 ) \u2212 30\u03c80 (xi) + 16\u03c80 ( xi+1/2 ) \u2212 \u03c80 (xi+1)\n3h2 . (4.5)\nSuppose we consider the central finite difference scheme given by (4.5) in the initial condition described by (2.7) for the first temporal layer. In that case, we can represent it discretely at spatial points xi as follows:\nu1,i = \u03c80,i + \u03c4\u03c81,i + \u03c42 2 ( f0,i + q0\u03c8\u03030,i ) , with \u03c80,i = \u03c80 (xi) and \u03c81,i = \u03c81 (xi) .\nTo implement the spatial discretization algorithm, the final step is to compute the integral term in the formula qk, as defined in (2.3). This is accomplished using composite Simpson\u2019s rule by providing that the spatial interval [0, \u2113] is divided into m subintervals, where m is an even number. The resulting expression can be obtained as follows:\nSk = \u2113\u222b\n0\n(u\u2032k (x)) 2dx \u2248 h3 (u\u2032k (x0))2 + (u\u2032k (xm))2 + 4 m/2\u2211 i=1 (u\u2032k (x2i\u22121)) 2 + 2 m/2\u22121\u2211 i=1 (u\u2032k (x2i)) 2  . Note that to evaluate the values of u\u2032k (x0) and u\u2032k (x1), we employ the forward finite difference approximation with fourth-order accuracy, which can be expressed as follows:\nu\u2032k (xj) \u2248 \u221225uk,j + 48uk,j+1 \u2212 36uk,j+2 + 16uk,j+3 \u2212 3uk,j+4\n12h , j = 0, 1 .\nIn order to compute the values of the first-order derivative of the function uk (x) at the grid points xm\u22121 and xm, we use a technique similar to those employed in previous cases. However, in this scenario, we apply a fourth-order accurate backward finite difference scheme, which is defined as follows:\nu\u2032k (xj) \u2248 3uk,j\u22124 \u2212 16uk,j\u22123 + 36uk,j\u22122 \u2212 48uk,j\u22121 + 25uk,j\n12h , j = m\u2212 1,m .\nFor the nodes xj with j = 2, 3, . . . ,m\u2212 2, the values of u\u2032k (xj) are determined by means of the central finite difference approximation with fourth-order accuracy, defined as:\nu\u2032k (xj) \u2248 uk,j\u22122 \u2212 8uk,j\u22121 + 8uk,j+1 \u2212 uk,j+2\n12h .\nFinally, we denote the fourth-order accurate approximations of the values of Sk and qk as S\u0303k and q\u0303k, respectively. Thus, we have q\u0303k = \u03b1k + \u03b2kS\u0303k."

            "text": "Let us study the stability of the tridiagonal system of linear equations (4.3). To do so, we rewrite this system in the matrix-vector form using the following notations:\nwk = (wk,1, wk,2, . . . , wk,m\u22121)\u22a4 ,\nand vjk = (vk,j , vk,j+1, . . . , vk,j+m\u22122) \u22a4 , j = 0, 1, 2 . Consequently, the system (4.3) is reformulated as follows: Bkwk = \u03c6k , k = 1, 2, . . . , n\u2212 1 , (4.6)\nwhere \u03c6k = \u2212 \u03b42\n6qk\n( v0k + 2 ( 5 + \u03b4 2\nqk\n) v1k + v2k ) , vjk = \u03c4 2f jk + 2u j k .\nThe solution associated with the given data (fk,uk, qk) is denoted by wk, where the system is referred to as (4.6). Herein, considering a perturbation of this data, denoted by ( f\u0303k, u\u0303k, q\u0303k ) , leads to the solution denoted by w\u0303k. The objective is to estimate wk \u2212 w\u0303k using the following differences: fk \u2212 f\u0303k, uk \u2212 u\u0303k, and qk \u2212 q\u0303k. It is evident that w\u0303k satisfies the following system\nB\u0303kw\u0303k = \u03c6\u0303k , (4.7) where B\u0303k is derived from the matrix Bk by substituting qk with q\u0303k. Furthermore, q\u0303k is obtained by replacing uk with u\u0303k in qk. Remark 4.1.

Moreover, w\u0303k represents the solution obtained from the perturbed data ( f\u0303k, u\u0303k, q\u0303k ) , which corresponds to the perturbed system (4.7).\nProof. It is evident that the subsequent identity can be derived from equations (4.6) and (4.7) wk \u2212 w\u0303k = B\u22121k \u03c6k \u2212 B\u0303\u22121k \u03c6\u0303k = ( B\u22121k \u2212 B\u0303\u22121k ) \u03c6k + B\u0303\u22121k (\u03c6k \u2212 \u03c6\u0303k)\n= B\u0303\u22121k ( B\u0303k \u2212 Bk ) B\u22121k \u03c6k + B\u0303\u22121k (\u03c6k \u2212 \u03c6\u0303k) .\nHence, we obtain that \u2225wk \u2212 w\u0303k\u22252 \u2264 \u2225\u2225B\u0303\u22121k (B\u0303k \u2212 Bk)B\u22121k \u03c6k\u2225\u22252 + \u2225\u2225B\u0303\u22121k (\u03c6k \u2212 \u03c6\u0303k)\u2225\u22252 .

(4.10)\nThe following inequality holds for the vectors vjk, where j = 0, 1, 2\u2225\u2225\u2225vjk\u2225\u2225\u22252 \u2264 2\u2225\u2225u1k\u2225\u22252 + \u03c42 max0\u2264j\u22642\u2225\u2225\u2225f jk\u2225\u2225\u22252 . (4.11) From the estimation (4.10), taking into account (4.11) it follows that\n\u2225\u03c6k\u22252 \u2264 2\u03b42 qk\n( 1 + \u03b4 2\n6qk )( 2 \u2225\u2225u1k\u2225\u22252 + \u03c42 max0\u2264j\u22642\u2225\u2225\u2225f jk\u2225\u2225\u22252 ) . (4.12)\nFor the inverse matrix of Bk, the following estimation is valid,\u2225\u2225B\u22121k \u2225\u22252 = 1min 1\u2264i\u2264m\u22121 |\u03bbk,i| \u2264 ( 2\u03b42 qk ( 1 + \u03b4 2 6qk ))\u22121 . (4.13)\nAnalogously to the expression (4.13), we derive the following inequality\u2225\u2225B\u0303\u22121k \u2225\u22252 \u2264 (2\u03b42q\u0303k ( 1 + \u03b4 2 6q\u0303k ))\u22121 . (4.14)\nLet us now move forward with the evaluation of the matrix difference, denoted as B\u0303k \u2212 Bk. Evidently, at each temporal layer, the matrix exhibits the characteristics of a diagonal-constant matrix, featuring nonzero elements only along the principal diagonal, with all other entries being zero. These components precisely correspond to the difference b\u0303k \u2212 bk. Through a straightforward calculation, we arrive at the result\nb\u0303k \u2212 bk = 2\u03b42 q\u0303kqk\n(q\u0303k \u2212 qk) ( 1 + \u03b4 2\n6q\u0303k + \u03b4\n2\n6qk\n) . (4.15)\nUpon considering the inequalities (4.12), (4.13), (4.14) together with (4.15) for the first term of the right-hand side of inequality (4.9), we derive the following conclusion\u2225\u2225B\u0303\u22121k (B\u0303k \u2212 Bk)B\u22121k \u03c6k\u2225\u22252 \u2264 |q\u0303k \u2212 qk|qk ( 1 + q\u0303k qk )( 2 \u2225\u2225u1k\u2225\u22252 + \u03c42 max0\u2264j\u22642 \u2225\u2225\u2225f jk\u2225\u2225\u22252 ) . (4.16)\nEmploying a straightforward transformation, we immediately establish the following identity \u03c6k \u2212 \u03c6\u0303k = \u03c8k,1 +\u03c8k,2 ,\nwhere:\n\u03c8k,1 = \u03b42\n6q\u0303kqk (qk \u2212 q\u0303k)\n[ v0k + 2 ( 5 + \u03b4 2\nq\u0303k + \u03b4\n2\nqk\n) v1k + v2k ] , (4.17)\n\u03c8k,2 = \u03b42\n6q\u0303k\n[( v\u03030k \u2212 v0k ) + 2 ( 5 + \u03b4 2\nq\u0303k\n)( v\u03031k \u2212 v1k ) + ( v\u03032k \u2212 v2k )] . (4.18)\nBy applying inequality (4.11) in a way similar to (4.12), we can derive the estimates for (4.17) and (4.18), viz.\u2225\u2225\u03c8k,1\u2225\u22252 \u2264 2\u03b42q\u0303kqk |qk \u2212 q\u0303k| ( 1 + \u03b4 2 6q\u0303k + \u03b4 2 6qk )( 2 \u2225\u2225u1k\u2225\u22252 + \u03c42 max0\u2264j\u22642\u2225\u2225\u2225f jk\u2225\u2225\u22252 ) , (4.19)\n\u2225\u2225\u03c8k,2\u2225\u22252 \u2264 2\u03b42q\u0303k ( 1 + \u03b4 2 6q\u0303k )( 2 \u2225\u2225u\u03031k \u2212 u1k\u2225\u22252 + \u03c42 max0\u2264j\u22642 \u2225\u2225\u2225f\u0303 jk \u2212 f jk\u2225\u2225\u22252 ) . (4.20)\nIn light of inequalities (4.19) and (4.20) along with (4.14) applied to the second term of the right-hand side of inequality (4.9), we deduce the subsequent estimation\u2225\u2225B\u0303\u22121k (\u03c6k \u2212 \u03c6\u0303k)\u2225\u22252 \u2264 |qk \u2212 q\u0303k|qk ( 1 + q\u0303k qk )( 2 \u2225\u2225u1k\u2225\u22252 + \u03c42 max0\u2264j\u22642 \u2225\u2225\u2225f jk\u2225\u2225\u22252 ) + 2 \u2225\u2225u\u03031k \u2212 u1k\u2225\u22252 + \u03c42 max0\u2264j\u22642\u2225\u2225\u2225f\u0303 jk \u2212 f jk\u2225\u2225\u22252 . (4.21)\nWhen we substitute the inequalities (4.16) and (4.21) into (4.9), the result (4.8) is obtained, thereby concluding the proof. Definitely, the stability of the system (4.3) follows from the inequality (4.8)."

Figure 1 presents log-log scale graphs demonstrating the dependence of maximum absolute errors between the exact and approximate solutions of Test 1 under four different scenarios: \u03bb = 1, 3, 7, 11, with respect to temporal steps. The logarithmic scales are used on both the abscissa and ordinate axes. The horizontal axis corresponds to the decimal logarithms of the temporal steps denoted as \u03c4j = 10\u22121(100 \u2212 j)\u22121, while the vertical axis represents the maximum absolute errors g (\u03c4j) = max1\u2264k\u2264nj E1000 (k\u03c4j) for j = 0, 1, . . . , 99. It is assumed that when h is sufficiently small, the behavior of g (\u03c4j) can be expressed by g (\u03c4j) \u2248 c\u03c42j (c = const > 0). Consequently, log10 (g (\u03c4j)) \u2248 2 log10 (\u03c4j) + log10 (c). In other words, on a log-log scale graph, the error exhibits a linear relationship with a slope of 2, which signifies a second-order accuracy regarding the temporal variable. To perform curve fitting on the given data points in all four two-dimensional graphs, Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is employed. The resulting curves correspond to straight lines with slopes approximately equal to 2, providing evidence that the proposed scheme (2.2) achieves second-order accuracy with respect to the temporal variable. In each of the four cases, the division number m of the spatial domain remains fixed at m = 1000.\nConsider the set of sample points denoted by the data pairs (X,Y ) = {(Xj , Yj) , j = 0, 1, . . . , 99}, where Xj and Yj represent the base-10 logarithm of \u03c4j and the base-10 logarithm of g (\u03c4j), respectively.\nLet us define the function Yj = Y\u0302j + \u03b5\u0302j , j = 0, 1, . . . , 99 ,\nwhere Y\u0302j (fitted values) are obtained by substituting Xj into the equation of regression line: Y\u0302j = b\u03021Xj + b\u03020. The residuals \u03b5\u0302j = Yj \u2212 Y\u0302j represent the differences between the given data points Yj and the fitted values Y\u0302j . In statistics, it is well-known that the sum of squared residuals (SSres) can be expressed as follows:\nSSres = \u2211\nj\n(\u03b5\u0302j)2 = SY Y ( 1 \u2212 S 2 XY\nSXXSY Y\n) = SY Y ( 1 \u2212 r2 ) ,\nwhere SXX = \u2211 j ( X\u0304 \u2212Xj )2 , SXY = \u2211 j ( X\u0304 \u2212Xj ) ( Y\u0304 \u2212 Yj ) , SY Y = \u2211 j ( Y\u0304 \u2212 Yj )2 .\nHere, X\u0304 and Y\u0304 represent the arithmetic means of the values of X and Y , respectively. In Table 1, for all four cases under consideration, the coefficient of determination, denoted as r2, consistently matches a value of 1 with a high level of precision. This indicates that a linear regression equation perfectly describes the relationship between Xj and Yj , with all data points exhibiting close proximity to the corresponding regression line Y\u0302j .\nIn Figure 2, we present the exact and approximate solutions of Test 2 at the specific time point t = 1. The solid and dashed curves correspond to the exact and approximate solutions. In Figure 2 and Table 2, (a) and (b) represent the case where \u03bb = 5, while (c) and (d) correspond to \u03bb = 17. In the original configuration, the spatial grid has a spacing of h = 1/32, which is subsequently halved. Additionally, the value of the temporal step \u03c4 is equal to h2 for each pair of considered cases. The test results demonstrate that solely increasing the number of temporal layers is insufficient to achieve high-order accuracy; it is also necessary to increase the number of spatial domain divisions. This phenomenon arises as a consequence of the significant oscillation number, denoted as \u03bb, appearing in the exact solution of the considered cases. It is essential to observe that the constant in the error estimate of the proposed algorithm contains a maximum absolute value of high-order partial derivatives of the solution with respect to both temporal and spatial variables. Furthermore, it is also dependent on the maximum absolute values of q (t), which in turn involve the time-varying coefficients \u03b1 (t), \u03b2 (t), as well as the integral of [u\u2032x (x, t)]\n2 with respect to x. From a numerical implementation perspective, it is also recommended to carefully choose values for h and \u03c4 in such a manner that the condition numbers of the coefficient matrices of the tridiagonal systems obtained per temporal layer remain within a practically acceptable range. This guarantees the existence of a well-defined solution for each time step.\nThe resulting maximum absolute errors for each distinct case are presented in Table 2. Moreover, we evaluate the maximum values of condition numbers of the coefficient matrices associated with the tridiagonal systems (4.3) at the specified temporal layers. These condition numbers are indicated in Table 2.\nIt should be noted that in Table 2, our main focus centres around tracking the evolution of errors in relation to the variable t. In this instance, we have set the values of \u03c4 and h in such a way that \u03c4 = h2, resulting in an overall approximation order of O ( h4 )\nfor the combined scheme. However, this specific choice does not generally ensure the stability of the condition numbers of the coefficient matrices Bk associated with the tridiagonal systems (4.3), which can be further affected by the oscillatory behaviour of the values of qk. In addition, we compute the maximum values of condition numbers of the matrices Bj for j = 1, 2, . . . , k \u2212 1. As we pursue numerical solutions in the (j + 1)-layer, it is necessary to solve the systems (4.3) for the previous j-th layer.\nLet us consider the test problem, which represents a homogeneous formulation of the problem (1.1a)-(1.1c) under consideration. In this context, we have constructed an exact solution for this particular problem. Test 3.\n\u03c80 (x) = a sin ( \u03bb\u03c0\n\u2113 x\n) , \u03c81 (x)= a 2 sin ( \u03bb\u03c0 \u2113 x ) , f (x, t) = 0 ,\n\u03b1 (t) = \u2113 3 \u2212 b\n4\u2113\u03bb2\u03c02(1 + t)2 , \u03b2 (t)= b 2a2\u03bb4\u03c04(1 + t)3 , 0 < b < \u21133 .\nu (x, t) = a \u221a 1 + t sin ( \u03bb\u03c0\n\u2113 x\n) is an exact solution for the specific problem instance in Test 3. To\nnumerically realize the problem, we adopt the following parameter values: the length of the string, \u2113 = 1; time interval, T = 1; a = 1; and b = \u21133/2.\nIn Table 3, we present the maximum absolute errors between the exact and approximate solutions of Test 3, computed using formula (4.22). Similar to the previous problem in Test 2, we consider four cases with the same oscillation numbers \u03bb, assuming \u03c4 to be equal to h. For the case when \u03bb = 5, we use spatial grid sizes of m = 16 and m = 32. In the case of \u03bb = 17, we double the spatial grid sizes, resulting in m = 64 and m = 128. As demonstrated in the Table 3, the maximum absolute errors, corresponding to the specified temporal steps, remain sufficiently small as long as the temporal and spatial grids are not excessively small. In the generated plots, the approximate solution closely approximates the exact solution, resulting in an overlapping representation. Hence, these plots have been omitted from the article.\nOne of the contributing factors to these small errors is the relatively low maximum absolute value of q (t), which can be attributed to the time-varying coefficients \u03b1 (t) and \u03b2 (t). Furthermore, since \u03b4 = 1 and the maximum value of q (t) is small, they ensure that the condition numbers of the coefficient matrices of the tridiagonal systems obtained for each temporal layer are excellent, being close to unity (see (4.4)). This, in turn, further enhances the accuracy of the solutions.\nConsider the homogeneous form of the Kirchhoff string equation (1.1a) for which the exact solution is currently unknown. In this situation, we opt for specific parameter values: the length of the string, \u2113 = 4; the time interval, T = 1; and the time-dependent coefficients are fixed, with \u03b1 (t) = \u03b2 (t) = 1. Test 4.\n\u03c80 (x) = exp ( \u2212(2x\u2212 \u2113)2 )( P\u030333 (x) \u2212 P\u030331 (x) ) , \u03c81 (x) = 0 , f (x, t) = 0 .\nHere, P\u0303N (x) denotes the shifted Legendre polynomials of degree N , defined as P\u0303N (x) = PN (\n2 \u2113 x\u2212 1\n) , where\nPN (x) represents the Legendre polynomials of degree N . The difference of the shifted Legendre polynomials ensures the fulfilment of the compatibility conditions for \u03c80 (x), namely \u03c80 (0) = \u03c80 (\u2113) = 0.\nBefore we begin explaining the approach used to derive the solution for this particular scenario, let us introduce the essential notations required for better understanding.\nLet u ( xi, t (j) k ) \u2248 u(j)k,i , i = 0, 1, . . . ,m , k = 0, 1, . . . , nj ,\nwhere nj = 2jn0 , t(j)k = k\u03c4j , \u03c4j = T\nnj .\nWe propose the following criteria to assess the errors between every two successive approximate solutions for j = 1, 2, . . . , namely:\nE\u0303(j)m = max0\u2264k\u2264nj max 0\u2264i\u2264m \u2223\u2223\u2223u(j\u22121)k,i \u2212 u(j)2k,i\u2223\u2223\u2223 . Suppose that approximate solutions u(0)k,i and u (1) 2k,i are found, and an error tolerance tol is fixed. If E\u0303 (j) m \u2264 tol, then terminate the process and return the solution u(j)2k,i.\nWe have implemented six different cases, where the error tolerance is defined as tol = 10\u2212r with r = 1, 2, . . . , 6. The spatial domain is discretized into m = 1024 segments, and the initial division of the temporal domain is prescribed as n0 = 128. The numerical results are compiled in Table 4. Notably, the obtained numerical solutions for all six cases exhibit remarkable similarity through their respective plots, providing convincing evidence of effectively approximating the exact solution to the given problem.\nFor illustrative purposes, we present Figure 4 under the condition that the error tolerance is tol = 10\u22126. The numerical approximation of the solution is assessed at four specific temporal instances, namely: t = 0.25, t = 0.5, t = 0.75, and t = 1.\nIn Table 5, we present data corresponding to the error tolerance tol = 10\u22126, along with the respective number of divisions of the temporal domain nj , at which the process halts with E\u0303(j)m \u2264 10\u22126. Additionally, Table 5 includes the maximum condition numbers denoted as max1\u2264k\u2264nj\u22121 \u03ba2 (Bk) for each maximum temporal layer. Let us remind you that our method involves the determination of an approximate solution for each (k + 1)-th layer, wherein a system of linear equations (4.3) is solved based on the preceding k-th layer, with k taking values from 1 to nj \u2212 1. Furthermore, the resulting condition numbers conform to the estimate provided in (4.4).\nFunding\nThe second author of this article was supported by the Shota Rustaveli National Science Foundation of Georgia (SRNSFG) [grant number: FR-21-301, project title: \u201cMetamaterials with Cracks and Wave Diffraction Problems\u201d]."
