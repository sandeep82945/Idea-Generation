    "abstractText": "Evidence suggests that psychedelics bring about their therapeutic outcomes in part through the subjective or qualitative effects they engender and how the individual interprets the resulting experiences. However, psychedelics are contraindicated for individuals who have been diagnosed with certain mental illnesses, on the grounds that these subjective effects may be disturbing or otherwise counter-therapeutic. Substantial resources are therefore currently being devoted to creating psychedelic substances that produce many of the same biological changes as psychedelics, but without their characteristic subjective effects. In this article, we consider ethical issues arising from the prospect of such potential \u201cnonsubjective\u201d psychedelics. We are broadly supportive of efforts to produce such substances for both scientific and clinical reasons. However, we argue that such nonsubjective psychedelics should be reserved for those special cases in which the subjective effects of psychedelics are specifically contraindicated, whereas classic psychedelics that affect subjective experience should be considered the default and standard of care. After reviewing evidence regarding the subjective effects of psychedelics, we raise a number of ethical concerns around the prospect of withholding such typically positive, meaningful, and therapeutic experiences from most patients.",

            "text": "Psychedelics reliably produce substantially altered states of consciousness\u2014but how do these subjectively experienced effects relate to the therapeutic effects of psychedelics demonstrated in recent research? Could a psychedelic be created that has no subjective effects (i.e., a \u201cnonsubjective\u201d psychedelic) but identical therapeutic impacts? The prospect of such nonsubjective psychedelics is scientifically and clinically interesting but raises several bioethical considerations.\nTwo distinct views have emerged regarding the question of whether it is possible for a nonsubjective psychedelic to have the same therapeutic impact as currently available psychedelic substances, with their characteristic effects on subjective experience (i.e., altered states of consciousness). On the one hand, David Olson1 has suggested that the subjective effects of psychedelics are likely \u201cunnecessary for their therapeutic effects.\u201d According to this view, currently measurable biological processes which have no subjective correlates (e.g., neurogenesis and neuroplasticity) can entirely account for the benefits of psychedelics and are all that are needed to achieve their therapeutic impact (e.g., reducing depression or treating substance use disorders as well as increasing well-being\u2014described below).\n\u00a9 The Author(s), 2022.

Such changes may involve, for example, explicit adoption of alternative conceptual frameworks through which to view and interpret one\u2019s experiences, motivations, and social relationships.3 While we can imagine nonsubjective psychedelics having some (kinds of) therapeutic impact, we believe it is highly likely that such impact will be less strong and less enduring than what can be achieved through the experience of, and conscious engagement with, the subjective effects of psychedelics.\nData from ongoing preclinical and clinical studies may help adjudicate between these two views. For example, studies using experimental methods such as the controlled manipulation of exposure to anesthesia could provide relevant evidence. In what David B. Yaden and Roland R. Griffiths (see note 2) describe as a \u201ccritical test,\u201d psychedelics would be introduced during deep anesthesia (expected to eliminate any subjective effects of the psychedelics due to the anesthesia-induced suppression of conscious awareness) in one experimental condition and during ordinary waking consciousness in another condition. If the former (anesthetized) mode of administration resulted in equivalent and equally enduring therapeutic effects as psychedelics administered without anesthesia, then this would provide evidence in favor of Olson\u2019s4 view. Another way to test the relative strength of the competing views would be to create psychedelics that act in a nearly identical biological manner but which do not produce subjective effects, as is currently being actively explored.\nPsychedelics that produce therapeutic benefits, but which do not produce a substantially altered state of consciousness, have not yet been created. However, a large amount of funding frommilitary and industry sources has been allocated in order to pursue the possibility of psychedelics or psychedelic-like substances of this kind effects.5 The rationale for such efforts has been,6 broadly: (1) the subjective effectsmay not have any causal role in the therapeutic effects (as mentioned, this issue has not been scientifically settled), (2) the subjective effects of psychedelics could be harmful to some people (e.g., those with a personal or family history of psychotic disorders), for who experiencing the subjective effects of psychedelics is indeed contraindicated,7 and (3) the cost of treatment could be reduced as there might be less of a need for active clinical support during the experience of acute subjective effects (as these may not need to occur). There is no doubt that the discovery of such substances would be valuable scientifically (e.g., to address the first point) and in some cases clinically (e.g., to address the second and third points).\nThe issue at stake in the present article is not whether such substances should be created, as we agree they would have considerable value. Instead, the ethical issues we are concerned with arising when considering whether such possible nonsubjective psychedelics should be the default treatment option. That is, granting the possibility that nonsubjective psychedelics can be created, what should be the standard of care for most patients?"

            "text": "As Olson21 argues, it may be possible to develop substances that produce equivalent therapeutic benefits to psychedelics without their subjective effects. If so, this would likely be due to several basic neurobiological processes associated with psychedelics that have been elucidated. Psychedelics, in both in vivo and in vitro studies, have beenmeasured and shown to produce neurogenesis22,23; they are also known to foster neural plasticity.24 The prospect of creating chemical substances that are capable of promoting processes such as neurogenesis and neural plasticity without triggering subjectively experienced altered states of consciousness is actively being pursued, as noted, through many millions of dollars of funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and industry sources.\nThe motivation behind efforts to produce nonsubjective psychedelics appears, as mentioned, to be two-fold\u2014scientific and clinical. In addition to the aforementioned scientific question regarding whether the altered state of consciousness associated with psychedelics is causally necessary to produce the therapeutic effects of these substances (but there is a need to carefully qualify issues related to studying \u201cconsciousness\u201d with psychedelics),25 there are also questions around basic neuropsychopharmacology at stake that could be better understood through this process. Clinically, the subjective effects of psychedelics may prevent certain groups of people from receiving them\u2014such as those with a history (including family history) of psychotic disorders. Currently, this is considered a risk factor for negative outcomes and is generally an exclusion criterion for both research and therapy,26 although it is not yet established whether potential nonsubjective psychedelics would be safe for these patient populations. In any case, we want to reiterate our support efforts to create such substances.\nThere are, however, important downsides to consider regarding using these potential substances as the default option or the standard of care."

            "text": "The nature of the subjective effects of psychedelics\u2014which so many resources are currently being devoted to removing\u2014has been variously characterized, but the field is working toward a convergence. The effects of psychedelics involve perceptual changes such as seeing patterns and vivid inner imagery, intense positive and negative emotions, as well as feelings of connection and egodissolution.27,28\nThe acute subjective effects of psychedelics can be psychologically challenging (colloquially described as \u201cbad trips\u201d). The unusual and sometimes confusing nature of the subjective effects can cause anxiety and even panic in some people. A survey of recreational psychedelic users who had \u201cchallenging\u201d experiences on psilocybin (i.e., not a representative sample) found that 39% of the respondents rated it among the most challenging experiences in their life (note: this is not always interpreted as negative or regrettable; \u201cchallenging\u201d experiences are often those from which a person learns the most), but, more ominously, 11% reported putting themselves or others at some risk, 2.7% requiredmedical attention, and 7.6% subsequently sought treatment for enduring psychological symptoms that they attributed to the experience.29 In two psychedelic administration studies in psychedelic na\u00efve participants, strong or extreme ratings of fear occurred in 31%30 and fear and other related states were reported in 39% of participants31 at some time during sessions, with sustained anxiety or unpleasant psychological struggle during sessions occurring in 11% of participants.32 Again, these participants did not uniformly consider the experiences of fear or anxiety as rendering the whole experience undesirable; rather, such negative emotions were often interpreted as meaningful in themselves and/or accompanied by positive emotions or feelings of growth.33\nIn terms of lasting negative impacts of psychedelics, postsession negative symptoms occurred in 0.9% of 110 participants in drug administration studies at theVollenweider laboratory in Switzerland (see note 26) and, likewise in 0.9% of 250 participants in studies at Johns Hopkins.34\nDespite these challenging experiences during sessions and some risk of lingering negative effects in terms of psychological stress, psilocybin has been rated as among the safest of all so-called \u201crecreational\u201d\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /S\n09 63\n18 01\n22 00\n00 7X\nP ub\nlis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\ndrugs in terms of risk of harm to oneself or others.35Moreover, classic psychedelics show a positive safety profile (including with respect to neurotoxicity or potential for addiction) when compared with many commonly prescribed drugs used for medication.36\nCrucially for our discussion here, in addition to the fact that many temporally limited negative emotions (e.g., fear and anxiety) are subsequently interpreted as meaningful or instrumental for achieving personal insights or growth, the acute subjective effects of psychedelics when administered under supportive conditions are rated as producing substantial increases in a deeply felt positive mood (e.g., feelings of peace, tranquility, and joy).37,38,39,40\nIn terms of persisting positive effects, there are a number of well-being related outcomes that are may be orthogonal to therapeutic effects. In a randomized cross-over trial comparing psilocybin to methylphenidate, participants reportedmuch larger increases in positive attitudes about life and/or self, positive mood changes, altruistic/positive social effects, positive behavior change, andwell-being 2months after a psilocybin session than after amethylphenidate session.41 Another study involving low and high doses of psilocybin42 found that 1 month after high dose psilocybin sessions, 94% of participants endorsed an increased sense of well-being and 89% endorsed positive behavior change. One finding is worth special mention in this context\u2014the well-replicated finding in at least four clinical trials thatmost participants (mean 76%, range 58\u201394%) rate their psychedelic experiences among the most meaningful experiences of their entire lives 6\u201314 months after their last session.43,44,45,46\nDespite these promising findings, we caution that more research is needed, especially better controlled and larger trials before firm conclusions can be drawn regarding these seemingly highly positive effects.47 With these caveats in place, we believe that the current evidence suggests that the subjective effects of psychedelics pose some risk of inducing a challenging and stress-inducing experience that may in some cases have lingering negative psychological consequences, but that the vast majority of participants report highly beneficial effects that are in many cases considered extraordinarily meaningful."

            "text": "If we grant the hypothetical case that nonsubjective psychedelics were created that were shown to be equally effective at reducing identified mental disorders, then should subjective or nonsubjective psychedelics be the default treatment?\nOlson48 has argued that nonsubjective psychedelics should be the default treatment for several reasons. He emphasizes the risks associated with subjective effects of psychedelics, particularly for some patient populations\u2014but also for people in general. As we have acknowledged, there are indeed risks from psychedelic experiences to some individuals, particularly those who have a personal or family history with psychotic disorders. There is no question that psychedelic experiences can be challenging or negative, especially in some patient populations. We have no disagreement here and would indeed welcome nonsubjective psychedelics for this clinical application.\nAnother reason raised by Olson49 is the clinical costs associated with administering psychedelics in clinical settings. Typically, clinicians must spend several hours with patients. Instead, Olson argues, participants under the influence of the postulated nonsubjective psychedelics would need no supervision. This would cut healthcare costs, or so the argument goes. We agree that it is possible that nonsubjective psychedelics could reduce economic costs\u2014but at what human costs?\nAlready, there is a broad movement in medical ethics critiquing bioreductive approaches to treatment, wheremental health is conceived of in terms of brain states or chemical processes alone rather than (also) in terms of a person\u2019s lived experiences in sociorelational context, and the meanings they give to those experiences as part of a life narrative.50 To be a person, much less a person in goodmental health, is to experience and interpret the world in a certain way (or range of ways); it is not simply to be a bearer of nonpathological brain states. Accordingly, clinician-supported, psychedelic-assisted therapy involving an interpersonal process of interpretation, meaning-making, and integration, is considered the gold standard for treatments involving psychedelics.51 Thus, even if it is possible that nonsubjective\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /S\n09 63\n18 01\n22 00\n00 7X\nP ub\nlis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\npsychedelics could bring about equivalent treatment effects in terms ofmeasurable decrements in clinical symptoms, it is highly unlikely that they would also replicate the less-tangible, but perhaps no less important, effects on well-being derived from the human-to-human therapeutic encounter and associated sense-making of the narrative content of drug-induced subjective experiences or altered states of consciousness."

            "heading": "Ethical Considerations",
            "text": "In the domain of morality, there is a helpful distinction between negative morality and positive morality. Negative morality describes moral rules or laws that are widely socially recognized and interpreted as binding, which prevent us from taking certain actions, or tell us what we ought not to do. Positive morality, on the other hand, asks what we ought to do. This distinction is instructive when applied to the questions of subjective or nonsubjective psychedelics. If, throughout the course of effective treatments, we can help foster one of the most positive and meaningful experiences of a patient\u2019s life without undue risk, then, from the perspective of positivemorality, wemay be under some obligation to provide such an experience.\nSuch an approach is consistent with long-standing operationalizations of health, such as that adopted by the World Health Organization in 1948. According to the WHO,52 \u201cHealth is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\u201d It is uncontroversial that a major purpose of medicine is to improve the health of the population. In this regard, a negative approach to morality might instruct us to avoid taking actions that are likely to cause disease or infirmity. At best, it requires us to apply the tools of medicine to treat existing problems (since available treatments ought not to be withheld). However, a positive approach to morality might also include a duty to promote, in a more holistic fashion, the physical, mental, and social well-being of patients within our care. Stated differently, as bioethicists have long argued, the moral aims of medicine encompass more than simply \u201cdo no harm\u201d (i.e., the principle of nonmaleficence); rather, clinicians and other healthcare providers have a positive ethical duty of beneficence (i.e., to do good).53\nConsider the hypothetical availability of two otherwise equivalent chemical substances:\n1) One substance with the desired treatment effect vis-\u00e0-vis a circumscribed mental disorder and no adverse side-effects stemming from taking the drug 2) Another substance with the same desired treatment effects, a small risk of adverse side-effects stemming from the subjective experience of taking the drug, but also a high probability of a profoundly positive subjective experience as well as other persisting positive effects\nIt may be difficult to assign precise weights to the benefits and risks of each intervention; however, a broad analysis can still be given. The expected value or disvalue of an intervention is a product of both the likelihood of good or bad outcomes and the magnitude or degree of each. Given the available data regarding relatively low likelihood of adverse experiences (especially lasting negative experiences of any great magnitude) as well as a very high likelihood of positive experiences that are weighted as being of exceptional magnitude, we believe that consequentialist calculations would pick the second intervention as by far the more beneficent. To illustrate, less than 1% of participants report lingering negative effects (and of those, only aminority require therapeutic support), whereas about three-quarters of participants report the experience to be, as noted, among the most meaningful of their entire lives.\nAnother major principle of bioethics is the need to ground healthcare decisions in a stance of respect for persons, often operationalized in terms of valuing the autonomy of the individual. Autonomymeans allowing individuals to choose those ends which they themselves value, so long as others are not unduly harmed (or disrespected) in the pursuit of those ends. Almost everyone values well-being (which is typically enhanced by the subjective experience of psychedelics taken under the right conditions), but this is not the only valuable end that people may pursue. Rather, having a meaningful life is also highly valued by most people, and it is notable that the typical subjective effects of psychedelics are often\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /S\n09 63\n18 01\n22 00\n00 7X\nP ub\nlis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\ncharacterized in terms of meaningfulness, not simply increased positive mood or even general wellbeing.54 Such outcomes would presumably not be associated with nonsubjective psychedelics."

In addition to beneficence, therefore, there are reasons rooted in autonomy and respect for persons at least to offer classic psychedelics, with their attendant subjective effects, as the default treatment option and standard of care for those who do not have specific contraindications, while also allowing patients to choose the nonsubjective route if that is what would make them more comfortable. Overall, we support scientific efforts to create nonsubjective psychedelics, but we hope to ensure that the subjective effects of classic psychedelics remain an option for those who are willing and able, as many clinical trial participants report that this experience ranks among the most positive and meaningful of their lives.\nConflict of Interest.
