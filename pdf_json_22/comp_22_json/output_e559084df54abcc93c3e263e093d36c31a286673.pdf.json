    "abstractText": "Background: Germ cell tumors (GCTs) are neoplasms derived from reproductive cells, mostly occurring in children and adolescents at 10 to 19 years of age. Intracranial GCTs are classified histologically into germinomas and non-germinomatous germ cell tumors. Germinomas of the basal ganglia are difficult to distinguish based on symptoms or routine MRI images from gliomas, even for experienced neurosurgeons or radiologists. Meanwhile, intracranial germinoma has a lower incidence rate than glioma in children and adults. Therefore, we established a model based on pre-trained ResNet18 with transfer learning to better identify germinomas of the basal ganglia.",

Intracranial GCTs are classified histologically into germinomas and non-germinomatous germ cell tumors. Germinomas of the basal ganglia are difficult to distinguish based on symptoms or routine MRI images from gliomas, even for experienced neurosurgeons or radiologists. Meanwhile, intracranial germinoma has a lower incidence rate than glioma in children and adults. Therefore, we established a model based on pre-trained ResNet18 with transfer learning to better identify germinomas of the basal ganglia.\nMethods: This retrospective study enrolled 73 patients diagnosed with germinoma or glioma of the basal ganglia. Brain lesions were manually segmented based on both T1C and T2 FLAIR sequences. The T1C sequence was used to build the tumor classification model. A 2D convolutional architecture and transfer learning were implemented. ResNet18 from ImageNet was retrained on the MRI images of our cohort. Class activation mapping was applied for the model visualization.\nResults: The model was trained using five-fold cross-validation, achieving a mean AUC of 0.88. By analyzing the class activation map, we found that the model\u2019s attention was focused on the peri-tumoral edema region of gliomas and tumor bulk for germinomas, indicating that differences in these regions may help discriminate these tumors.\nConclusions: This study showed that the T1C-based transfer learning model could accurately distinguish germinomas from gliomas of the basal ganglia preoperatively.\nKeywords: germinoma, glioma, deep neural network, machine learning, transfer learning\nINTRODUCTION\nGerm cell tumors (GCTs) are neoplasms derived from reproductive cells, mostly occurring in children and adolescents at 10 to 19 years of age (1). Intracranial GCTs are classified histologically into germinomas (assessed in this study) and non-germinomatous germ cell tumors. Intracranial germinomas mostly arise from pineal or suprasellar regions (2, 3). Due to the adjacency to midbrain\nMarch 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 8441971\nstructures, intracranial germinoma patients usually develop hydrocephalus-related symptoms (3), and germinomas of the basal ganglia are difficult to distinguish from gliomas, which are the most common intracranial solid tumors, at the same site, even for experienced neurosurgeons or radiologists. Intracranial germinoma has a lower incidence rate compared with glioma in children and adults (4).\nIntracranial germinoma is sensitive to radiation therapy, and a satisfactory prognosis could be achieved without surgical operation; however, as mentioned above, it is difficult to diagnose by routine MRI (T1-weighted, T2-weighted and enhanced T1) without additional acquisition like DWI and SWI. Unfortunately, such images are not always available due to the patient\u2019s financial status or scanner machine-hour shortage in developing countries. Most entry-level hospitals in China are not equipped with an advanced 3T MRI scanner or haven\u2019t purchased those additional imaging modalities from scanner vendors. In situ biopsies obtained intraoperatively or preoperatively with the stereotactic guide represent the \u201cgold standard\u201d to diagnose germinomas for most of the cases (3, 5), while the potential risk of tumor seeding or spread cannot be ignored. For some patients, traumatic procedures like surgery can be avoided if it is possible to accurately distinguish germinomas from gliomas with routine MRI. Although germinoma is commonly seen in adolescents while glioma has a higher incidence in the elderly population, headache and dizziness are common symptoms reported by both glioma and germinoma patients. Similarities in clinical manifestations compared to glioma in addition to the rarity of germinoma cases make it difficult to distinguish these two types of tumor, despite the difference of age at diagnosis. The lower incidence rate of germinoma and the abovementioned similarities provide little motivations for physicians to require additional serum test in clinics for b-HCG, an important indicator of germinoma. Therefore, a model using only routine MRI that could help physicians decide whether a patient needs further lab examination before hospital admission in such a scenario would be valuable; furthermore, a simple system requiring minimal input information that could distinguish these two types of tumor would reduce the cost per patient by cutting down unnecessary tests.\nRecent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of tumor medical imaging have revealed that computers can achieve better accuracy in classifying different types of tumors than human physicians (6\u20138). Previous studies have investigated deep learningbased approaches to discriminate gliomas from other intracranial lesions including brain metastasis (9, 10), meningioma (10, 11), pituitary adenoma (10, 11), and acoustic neuroma (10). And other studies also reported the classification of germinoma with craniopharyngioma and pinealoblastoma (12, 13) by machine learning approaches. These reports focus on germinomas of the sellar and pineal region. Due to the uncommon incidence of germinomas of the basal ganglia, it has not been explored if routinely acquired MRI images can be utilized to differentiate germinomas from gliomas of this region. In this work, a deep learning model was established to answer this question. We enrolled 73 patients diagnosed with germinoma or glioma of the basal ganglia from two independent medical centers.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org 2\nSupplementary Figure S1 shows typical T1-weighted contrast images of glioma and germinoma patients enrolled in this study, with the characteristic irregular enhancement of tumor bulk and cyst formation, which are similar between these two tumor types (14\u201318).\nThe purpose of the study is to provide aid in preoperative decision-making with a classification system for intracranial germinomas and gliomas of the basal ganglia. Enhanced T1 MRI is routinely acquired for differential diagnosis of intracranial lesions and is what\u2019s solely needed for the neural network we developed based on ResNet-18 (19), which provides the strong capability for future clinical translation."

The delineated images of the two segmented tumor phenotypes (enhancing tumor and peritumoral edema) were exported for further analysis. Lesions smaller than 500 voxels (about 0.65 cm3) were excluded for the following reasons. Small lesions like this could not be reliably segmented, typically such a small lesion will only appear on a single slice or two which makes the image less representative and reliable for feature extraction. In patients with > 1 lesion, all the lesions larger than 500 voxels were included in the analysis. The entire dataset contained a total of 93 lesions (45 germinoma lesions and 48 glioma lesions) from 73 patients (Figure 1)."

More specifically, 6 data augmentation techniques were implemented, including random flip, random affine, random blur, random ghosting, random motion, and random elastic deformation. Examples of the augmented images are shown in Figure 2.\nThe retraining process consisted of two steps, including initializing the convolutional layers with loaded pre-trained weights that trained based on the ImageNet data, and freezing all convolutional layers and fine-tuning the classification layer. By resetting the finial layer into 2 and changing the loss function into cross-entropy, our model was able to implement the pre-learned image feature extractionpattern to this tumorclassification task and make prediction. To compare themodel performance, we also used\nthe same deep learning architecture to train our data from scratch. All the parameters were set identical with the pre-trained model except the randomly initial weights of convolutional layers.

In this study, 5-fold cross-validation was performed to train the model. In each fold, 80% cases were used as the training set and the rest were used as the validation set.

Specifically, for a unit k in a layer l, CAM calculates the importance score of k for class c and follows with visualizing the importance via a heatmap. We added a global average pooling layer after all the convolutional layer, which helps find all the discriminative regions. Feature maps of l before activation was visualized by CAM, then a heatmap was superimposed on input images."

Most previous reports of germinoma are case reports or prognosis analyses based on tens of cases. To our best knowledge, this is the largest cohort of basal ganglia germinoma and the first quantitative MRI image analysis. The rarity of this disease with the specific location makes it difficult to collect enough data to train a convolutional neural network from scratch. In this case, we applied two commonly implemented techniques. The first of which is data augmentation to increase the dataset size and fight overfitting. The second is transfer learning to dramatically reduce the number of parameters to fit (25, 26).\nIt is reported that color information improves the performance on object recognition tasks of human participants (27). As color image encodes more visual information than grayscale image. It is less explored if colorized medical image improves accuracy in diagnostic imaging when examined by a human radiologist. Kather, J. N. et al. showed that radiologists can detect cancer tissue on colorized MRI images, with equivalent performance on grayscale images, while receiving almost no extra previous training (28). Our transfer learning method is based on the ResNet18, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, a natural scene database consisting of over 14 million manually annotated RGB color images of over 1000 categories. The above inspired us to test if deep learning models also have better performance with colorized medical images in classification tasks. Currently, there is no well-acknowledged method for adding pseudo color to medical images. Previously reported method includes linear color conversion from grayscale to a color map (29), triplicate the grayscale channel to synthesize color image (30, 31), concatenating three independent slices from one or cross different series (planes) (32\u201335). In this study, we thoroughly benchmarked these methods. The results showed that linear transformation to a color map yielded the highest AUC in our dataset. This provides a valuable reference for future implementation of neural networks on medical imaging.\nNeural network-based machine learning models are infamously known as \u201cblack boxes\u201d. Therefore, CAM was implemented to improve interpretability, and to shed light on the decision-making process of the network, thus ensuring the focal point of the model doesn\u2019t fall in irrelevant areas. A few misclassified cases were shown in Supplementary Figure 6. For misclassified germinomas Supplementary Figure 6A, focal points of the model are located near ventricle structures and irrelevant peritumoral white matter. For misclassified gliomas Supplementary Figure 6B, focal points of the model located at the tumor bulk or edge of it. Previous reports showed that germinomas of the basal ganglia is characterized with minimal peritumoral edema (36, 37). As for glioma, peritumoral edema is a classic feature of MRI T2 image especially for high-grade glioma (38, 39). This might explain why the model fails on these specific cases and why it emphasizes peritumoral edema of gliomas. The model attention areas provide a valuable reference for physicians in case of suspected germinomas of the basal ganglia to avoid misdiagnosis. We delineated the tumor regions manually for CAM-related analysis, integrating automatic classification algorithms and auto segmentation of tumor will be explored in the future for the deployment of such models in clinical practice.\nFrontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org 7\nMedical images are volumetric datasets as they typically contain slices of body segments and organs. In this study, we developed a neural network model based on a single slice of T1C MRI image, which is routinely acquired in medical practices. Unlike the traditional radiomics based model, no laborious sliceby-slice segmentation and labeling is required. The moderate AUC of the model provides a stronger capability of clinical translation. The increased number of parameters and the higher computational complexity limited the application of 3D CNN currently, but it might perform better in a larger dataset than single-slice-based CNN.\nThis study had several limitations. First, the jet colormap was still not representative and interpretable for different regions on the image, such as the tumor bulk, edema, and normal tissues. In future research, a customized colormap both suitable for machine learning algorithms and human interpretation of MRI gray-scaled images should be developed. Second, although we implemented a good visualization method to identify the focus of this model and discovered the differences for both tumors, the biological meanings of the features of the model attention mechanism still need to be explored further. Interpretable CNN, which trains the kernel to represent the specific meaning of parts on objects, could integrate biological knowledge for better interpretability (40), which should be implemented in the future. Third, the dataset was still small even though we gathered data from two large medical centers. Data augmentation was used to alleviate this problem, still, the repeatability and robustness of the model should be validated with external data, if possible. Finally, our model showed moderate ability to generalize over various tumor sizes, but the model might have better performance on large lesions."
