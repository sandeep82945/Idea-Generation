The catalytic reduction efficiency of 4-NP was found to follow the order of Cu/0DZnO > Cu/ (1D + 0D)ZnO > Cu/1DZnO. The complete reduction of 4-NP has been observed to be achievable within 60 s using the Cu/0DZnO nanocomposite, with a kapp value of 8.42 min 1 and good recyclability of up to five cycles. This nanocomposite was then applied in the reduction of organic dyes in water; it was found that the reduction rate constants for the methylene blue, Congo red, and acriflavine hydrochloride dyes were 1.4 min , 1.2 min , and 3.81 min , respectively.

The removal of organic pollutants from water is essential to protect aquatic ecosystems, protect the health of human beings, and solve the problem of water shortage. Thus, it is crucial to develop advanced technologies for the removal of these toxic materials from wastewater.\nDifferent approaches such as electrocatalytic reduction,3 membrane separation,4 photocatalytic degradation,5 ozone oxidation,6 adsorption7 and biological treatment8 have been successfully established for the effective removal of these hazardous compounds or converting them to less toxic species. However, some of these techniques have the following disadvantages: (1) some cannot destroy the pollutants but transfer them from one phase to another, (2) some can degrade the pollutants but they require expensive apparatus, and (3) some methods can also effectively decompose the pollutants;\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The catalytic reduction of these pollutants has been reported as an effective approach for wastewater treatment technology.9,10 It can effectively degrade pollutants with good stability and recyclability. However, a highly active catalyst is required for effective pollution reduction in the environment.\nThe use of noble and transition metal nanoparticles-based catalysts as a heterogeneous catalyst for the reductive degradation of organic contaminants is very promising.11\u201313 These catalysts have a high density of active catalytic sites due to their recyclability, chemical and physical toughness, and a large surface area. Copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) exhibit high potential in the eld of nanoscience and nanotechnology due to their inexpensive cost and novel physiochemical characteristics; thus, they are being used to replace noble metal NPs. Recently, Cu NPs have been considered as promising catalysts for the oxidation of alcohols,14 oxidation of CO,15 C\u2013C bond formation reactions,16 C\u2013heteroatom bond formation,17 and various coupling reactions.18,19 Unfortunately, thermodynamically unstable Cu NPs are prone to coalescence and agglomeration, resulting in a signicant reduction in their catalytic activity. Immobilizing Cu NPs on specic supporting substrates, such as carbon materials,20 porous silica,21 polymers,22 metal oxides,23 and metal\u2013organic frameworks,24 are the most effective approaches for overcoming this drawback. Catalyst supports serve a critical function in preventing nanoparticle agglomeration and offer a high surface area, which makes it easier to be recovered and reused.25 Consequently, this prevents the leaching of nanoparticles in the environment and minimizes the cost at the same time. Beneting from the good loading capacity, geological abundance, ecofriendliness, easy synthesis, and remarkable structural stability, ZnO was widely utilized as a promising catalyst support. In this issue, Rasaki et al.26 synthesized Ag/ZnO nanorods catalyst, which showed the high catalytic reduction of 4-NP. A Ag/ZnO nanohybrid material was prepared by Oualid et al.27 using the sodium alginate method for the sonocatalytic reduction of 4-NP and antibacterial activity. The Ag@ZnO/MWCNT nanocomposite was investigated by Garc\u0301\u0131aValdivieso et al.28 for 4-NP reduction. Behera et al.29 synthesized maghemite/ZnO nanocomposites for 4-NP reduction. The CuO/ ZnO nanocomposite was synthesized in a green manner by the assistance ofMelissa officinalis L. leaf extract and investigated for the reduction of 4-NP and Rhodamine B by Bordbar et al.30 Alamro et al.31 synthesized ZnO supported on carbon nanotubes for 4-NP reduction via the laser assistancemethod. The ZnO/CdO thin lm for 4-NP catalytic degradation was investigated by Mostafa et al.32 Alula et al.33 prepared silver-coated ZnO/Fe3O4 composites for the reduction of 4-NP.\nThe physicochemical properties of ZnO supports such as effective charge separation, photovoltaic, electron trapping, photoluminescence, Lewis acid/base properties, defect formation, and strong metal\u2013ZnO interactions have been reported to play important roles in catalytic reactions.34 Their morphologies and nanostructures have a great impact on these properties. The Cu\u2013ZnO interactions inuence the interface structure and stability, which contributes signicantly to improve its catalytic\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

However, the inuence of the support morphology on the catalytic reduction of 4-NP and organic dyes over Cu NPs/ZnO has not been documented to our knowledge.\nIn this paper, the effect of the support morphology on the catalytic activity of Cu/ZnO nanocomposites for the reduction of 4-NP was studied. The pure ZnO and Cu/ZnO nanocomposites were characterized via transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM), UV-Vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The relationships between the catalytic performance of the nanocomposites with their surface area and their physicochemical properties were determined. The results revealed that the nanocomposite that contains 0D ZnO support showed the highest catalytic performance for the reduction of 4-NP. Moreover, this nanocomposite was applied for the reduction of organic dyes such as methylene blue, Congo red, and acriavine hydrochloride."

It was noted that the loading of Cu NPs on ZnO nanostructures leads to a decrease in the optical band gap of the nanocomposite, which results in absorption edge redshi. The decrease in the optical band gap energy could be attributed to high density oxygen vacancies and syndromes corresponding to the difference in the ionic radius and electronegativity between the Cu and ZnO ions because of the substitution procedure of Zn2+ by Cu2+ in the matrix. E. Gurger et al. have evaluated the optical band gap of ZnO to be 3.24 eV and by introducing Ag and Cu impurity atoms in the nanocomposite, the band gap narrowed to 3.18 eV and 3.12 eV for ZnO\u2013Cu and ZnO\u2013Ag, respectively.45 Chakraborty et al.46 found that copper doping decreases the electron\u2013hole recombination, and the optical band gap value was reduced from\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\n3.21 eV (ZnO) to 3.07 eV (Zn0.9Cu0.1O); these values are similar to our results. In addition, these impurities created a special imperfection, which seems to raise the Fermi level toward the conduction band.47,48 The light absorption in the semiconductor nanocomposites results in the transportation of the valence band electrons to a particular state through the conduction band to provide electron in the conduction band and hole in the valence band. If the size of the nanoparticle is equal to the de Broglie wavelength, then the conduction band is regarded as a quantum cavity of the electrons. According to the obtained results, we can conclude that the optical band gap of the prepared semiconductor nanocomposites could be affected by its morphological changes, and demonstrated a prospective agent for photovoltaics and other optical applications.\nFTIR studies were performed to ascertain the purity and nature of the functional groups available on the Cu/ZnO nanocomposites. The FTIR spectra of the ZnO nanostructures and Cu/ZnO nanocomposites are depicted in Fig. 5. The pristine 1D and (1D + 0D) ZnO nanostructures exhibited almost the same bands.

The band located at 3412 cm 1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of the OH groups, which resulted from water molecules adsorbing on the ZnO surface. The asymmetric and symmetric (C\u2013H) vibration modes of acetate CH2 groups were detected at 2922 cm 1 and 2852 cm 1.49 The vibration bands at 2359 cm 1 and 2341 cm 1 are assigned to atmospheric CO2.50 The bands ranging from 1561 cm 1 to 1383 cm 1 are attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibration of the C]O group,51 which may be due to zinc acetate used in the reaction. The bands detected at 871 cm 1 and 421 cm 1 are attributed to the stretching vibrational mode of the metal\u2013oxygen bond (Zn\u2013 O).52 In addition to the bands showed by 1D and (1D + 0D) ZnO, 0D ZnO exhibited three signals at 1775 cm 1, 1436 cm 1, and 880 cm 1, which could be because of the adsorbed carbonate\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 16496\u201316509 | 16501\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The differences in the bands positions and intensities for the acetate group may be due to the different amounts of acetate adsorbed on the ZnO surface. The FTIR spectra of Cu/ZnO nanocomposites showed that some bands are similar to pristine ZnO, while some new bands emerged. These new bands were detected at 1605 cm 1, 1427 cm 1, 1350 cm 1, 1160 cm 1, 1076 cm 1, and 1043 cm 1, which might be attributed to the presence of L-ascorbic acid55 since the reaction occurs under an excess of it. It was also noted that the band intensity of the hydroxyl group in the nanocomposite is sharper than that of pure ZnO.\nThe XRD patterns of the ZnO nanostructures and Cu/ZnO nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 6. The clear, intense diffraction peaks indicate the extremely crystalline quality of the grown nanoparticles. Aer the analysis of positions and comparative intensities of the diffracted peaks, the occurrence of single-phase hexagonal wurtzite of ZnO with space group P63mc was established.56 The XRD patterns of the ZnO nanostructures were similar, except for the variation in line broadening due to the change in the morphologies.

All the diffraction peak positions and their corresponding crystal planes are described by the standard spectrum (JCPSD card no. 01-089-0511).57 In addition, no additional reections can be detected related to the other impurities, indicating the high purity of the produced ZnO. On the other hand, the XRD patterns of Cu/ZnO nanocomposites showed typical reections of the pristine ZnO nanostructures. Moreover, a new reection was noticed at 2q \u00bc 42.7 (for Cu/1D and 0D ZnO) and 42.2 (for Cu/(1D + 0D) ZnO), which corresponded to (111), the preferred oriented plane of the FCC structure of Cu NPs, and no obvious reections arising from possible impurity phases such as CuO and Cu2O were detected.

In the case of 1D ZnO, adding copper to its crystals increases the micro-strain of the crystal because the nature of stacking the atoms in the form of rods decreases the interatomic distances during the stacking process, which makes the copper atoms substitute in the crystal sparsely. For (1D + 0D) zinc oxide crystals of larger size, adding copper decreases the micro-strain of the lattice crystal, which might be due to the nature of the mixed particles and how the atoms are packed. The increase in the inside crystal lattice strain of zinc oxide's spherical shape might be due to the presence of rather large interspaces within the spherical crystal nanostructure.\nThe N2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms (not shown) of ZnO nanostructures and Cu/ZnO nanocomposites, as obtained from Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) analysis, are type II, according to the IUPAC classication. The calculated specic areas of all the catalysts are cited in Table 2. The SBET of 1D ZnO, (1D + 0D) ZnO, 0D ZnO, Cu/1DZnO, Cu/(1D + 0D)ZnO, and Cu/0DZnO was about 10.1, 29.0, 23.9, 17.2, 35.5, and 36.1 m2 g 1, respectively. It is well known that the SBET increases with decreasing particle size and increases if the particles are multi-particle agglomerates or have a rough surface structure.58 Among the prepared\nFig. 8 UV-Vis spectra of the reduction of 4-NP using (a) the Cu NPs/1 composite as a catalyst and (c) Cu NPs/0DZnO nanocomposite as a catal Cu/ZnO nanocomposites as catalysts.\n16504 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 16496\u201316509\nsamples, 1D ZnO has a larger particle size (Fig. 2a) than that of the other samples, and thus, it has the smallest SBET value. Although (1D + 0D) ZnO has a particle size larger than that of 0D ZnO, it has a higher SBET value because it has multi-particle agglomerates (Fig. 2b). It was observed that the addition of Cu NPs to ZnOmaterials enhances their specic surface area due to the doping effect and the formation of new pores due to effective Cu species diffusion in the ZnO support.59 The observed increase in the surface area would be helpful for improving the catalytic activity of the nanocomposite catalyst.\nThe chemical states and surface compositions of the Cu/ 0DZnO nanocomposite were examined using XPS, and the results are shown in Fig. 7. The full survey spectrum in Fig. 7a indicates the presence of Zn, Cu, O, and C. The high-resolution spectrum for the Zn 2p region (Fig. 7b) shows two peaks at binding energies of 1044.8 eV and 1021.9 eV assigned to Zn 2p1/ 2 and Zn 2p3/2, respectively. The two peaks are separated by a spin-energy of 23 eV, indicating the existence of Zn in the +2 oxidation state.60 The narrow spectrum of Cu 2p reveals two main binding energy peaks at 952.1 eV and 932.2 eV, which correspond to the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 spin system of zerovalent Cu, respectively.42 Moreover, two peaks at binding energies of 944.7 eV and 934 eV as characteristics of Cu2+ were also\nDZnO nanocomposite as a catalyst, (b) Cu NPs/(1D + 0D)ZnO nanoyst, and (d) plots of ln(At/A0) versus reaction time in the presence of the\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

            "text": "3.2.1. Catalytic reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP. In the presence of excess NaBH4, the catalytic performance of Cu/ZnO nanocomposites was examined for the liquid phase reduction of 4- NP to 4-AP as a model reaction. The aqueous phase solution of 4-NP shows a noticeable absorption peak at lmax \u00bc 317 nm in the UV-Vis spectrum. Aer the injection of excess NaBH4, this absorption peak was redshied to 400 nm due to the formation of 4-nitrophenolate ions with a dark yellow color. The position and intensity of the peak at 400 nm remain unchanged without the catalyst. The decrease in the 4-nitrophenolate ion absorption peak (lmax \u00bc 400 nm) and the simultaneous appearance of a new peak of 4-AP at lmax \u00bc 300 nm indicated that the reduction reaction had proceeded. Using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer, the decline in the absorption peak at 400 nm was measured at regular intervals. The UV-Vis spectra during the reduction of 4-NP over Cu/ZnO nanocomposites are presented in Fig. 8. In the presence of pristine ZnO nanostructures, there was no discernible change in the absorption peak at lmax \u00bc 400 nm aer 1 h, which indicated that they have no catalytic activity for 4-NP reduction. These results are in agreement with those obtained by Bordbar et al.30 However, the decline in the absorption peak at 400 nm and the yellow color of the mixture started to disappear aer the addition of Cu NPs/ZnO nanocomposites in the reaction mixture. The Cu/0DZnO nanocomposite showed outstanding catalytic performance with 4-NP reduction efficiency of about 100% in 1 min, while the Cu/(1D + 0D)ZnO nanocomposite exhibited a reduction efficiency of 91% in 1 h. On the other hand, the Cu/1DZnO nanocomposites demonstrated a poor catalytic efficiency of 28% in 1 h. The Cu/ 0DZnO nanocomposites have a high catalytic performance due to their high specic surface area, small particle size, and excellent dispersion of Cu NPs on the ZnO surface, which provide more active sites for the reduction reaction.\nBecause the concentration of NaBH4 is substantially higher than that of 4-NP, the reaction is thought to follow pseudo rst order kinetics, as shown by the equation\nln At\nA0 \u00bc kappt (8)\nwhere A0 is the absorbance of 4-nitrophenolate ion (lmax \u00bc 400 nm) at zero time, At is the absorbance at different time intervals, kapp is the apparent reaction rate constant, and t is the reaction time. Fig. 8 shows the plot of ln(At/A0) versus time (t) and the kinetic data of 4-NP reduction catalyzed by Cu/1D, (1D + 0D), and 0D ZnO nanocomposites. The calculated rate constants were 0.00523, 0.03546, and 8.42 min 1 for Cu/1D, (1D + 0D), and 0D ZnO nanocomposites, respectively. Furthermore, the value of turnover frequency (TOF, mmol mgCu\n1 s 1) was estimated by the following equation.63\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nTOF \u00bc N4-NP MCut\n(9)\nwhere N (mmol) is the concentration of 4-NP,M (mg) represents the amount of Cu NPs, and t (s) is the reaction time. The comparison of the catalytic activity of the most active catalyst (Cu/0DZnO) with other Cu catalysts found in the literature is given in Table 2. The comparison indicates that the Cu/0DZnO nanocomposite has higher k and TOF values (300 10 6) than those of the other catalysts. The high catalytic activity of this catalyst may be due to the high specic surface area, ultrane size, and good dispersion of Cu NPs.\nBased on the previous investigations,75,76 the catalytic reduction of 4-NP over Cu/0DZnO nanocomposite is an electron transfer process and proceeded via two steps. The BH4\nions were rst diffused from the solution to the surface of the Cu NPs, forming a Cu-hydride complex via p\u2013p stacking interactions. Meanwhile, 4-NP was reversibly adsorbed on the surface of Cu NPs. Then, electron transfer occurred from BH4 and 4-\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 16496\u201316509 | 16505\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The hydrogen was transferred from the Cu hydride complex to the nitro group, which was then reduced. The nal product (4-AP) was desorbed from the surface of the nanocomposite. We may deduce from the previous explanation that the ZnO support can stabilize Cu NPs against aggregation and boost the reduction activity via a synergistic action.\nStability and reusability are important factors for a catalyst's practical application. To investigate if the Cu/0DZnO nanocomposite could be reused, ve successive cycles were carried out using 0.01 g of the catalyst; the results are shown in Fig. 9a. Aer each cycle, the catalyst was ltered out of the reaction mixture, washed several times with double-distilled water and ethanol, and dried at 60 C in an oven. Only a slight decrease in the catalytic activity of the nanocomposite was observed aer ve cycles. The primary cause of the decline in the catalytic activity is the loss of small portions of the catalyst during the separation process.\nThe effect of NaBH4 concentration variation (0.05 M to 0.2 M) on the catalytic performance of the Cu/0DZnO nanocomposite for the reduction of 4-NP was investigated while keeping the 4- NP concentration constant (0.1 mM). The plot of ln(At/A0) against time for every concentration of NaBH4 tested is displayed in Fig. 9b. It was found that when NaBH4 concentration shis from 0.05 M to 0.2 M, the kapp increases from 0.38 min 1\nFig. 10 UV-Vis spectra of the reduction of (a) MB, (b) CR, and (c) ACF usin versus reaction time in the presence of the Cu/0DZnO nanocomposite\n16506 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 16496\u201316509\nto 8.84 min 1. With increasing concentration of NaBH4, the produced BH4\nis increased, and more electrons are delivered to the 4-NP; thus, the reduction occurs rapidly with a higher kapp value and vice versa.77\n3.2.2. Catalytic reduction of methylene blue (MB). MB is a cationic dye that is utilized in the textile, paper, rubber, and plastic sectors and causes substantial environmental damage.78 The absorption peaks of MB in aqueous solution are 664 nm and 614 nm. In a typical catalytic reaction procedure, 0.3783 g NaBH4 was dissolved in 100 ml double-distilled water in a 250 mL beaker, then 100 mL of MB (1 10 2 M) solution was added. Fig. 10a shows the UV-Vis spectrum of MB reduction by NaBH4 in the presence of 0.01 g Cu/0DZnO nanocomposite. It has been noted that the intensities of the peaks for MB gradually decrease with time and fully disappear aer 2 min. The presence of Cu/0DZnO nanocomposite as the catalyst helps in the electron transfer from BH4\n(donor) to MB (acceptor). The reaction follows pseudo rst order kinetics because the concentration of NaBH4 is substantially higher than that of MB, and the linear relationship between ln(At/A0) and time (t) is depicted in Fig. 10d. The reaction's rate constant was estimated from the straight line's slope and was found to be 1.4 min 1.\n3.2.3. Catalytic reduction of Congo red (CR).

Fig. 10b shows the UV/ Vis spectrum of CR reduction by NaBH4 in the presence of Cu/ 0DZnO nanocomposite. Aer the addition of 0.01 g of the catalyst, the peaks intensities of CR gradually decreased with time, indicating that the catalytic reduction occurred, and the red color completely declined aer 3 min. The rate constant was estimated for the slope of the graph that represents the relation between ln(At/A0) and time (Fig. 10d), and was found to be 1.2 min 1.

ACF is a uorescent dye used as a biological stain, topical antiseptic, and in the dual uorescence analysis of cellular DNA and protein simultaneously. However, inspite of the benecial uses of this dye, it may be harmful to the eyes or if inhaled. The absorption peak of ACF in aqueous solution is 450 nm. In a typical experiment, 0.3783 g NaBH4 was dissolved in 100 mL double-distilled water in a 250 ml beaker, then 1 mL of ACF (1 10 2 M) solution was added. The time-dependent UV/Vis absorption spectra of ACF utilizing NaBH4 in the presence of Cu/0DZnO nanocomposite is displayed in Fig. 10c. Aer 0.01 g of Cu/0DZnO nanocomposite was added to the reaction mixture, the uorescent color gradually declined and completely disappeared aer 2 min. The calculated rate constant from the slope of the straight line produced from the relationship between ln(At/A0) and time (Fig. 10d) was found to be 3.81 min 1."

Metallic Cu NPs (5 wt%) were loaded on ZnO nanostructures by a simple reduction method using L-ascorbic acid as a reducing agent. The loading of Cu NPs on ZnO nanostructures leads to a decrease in the optical band gap, slight change in the crystallite sizes, increase in the specic surface area, and increase in the catalytic reduction of 4-NP. The catalytic performance of the nanocomposites takes the following order: Cu/0DZnO > Cu/(1D + 0D) ZnO > Cu/1DZnO. The Cu/0DZnO nanocomposite can reduce 4-NP in a very short time (60 s) with 100% efficiency. The high catalytic performance of this nanocomposite may be attributed to its small particle size, high surface area, and the high distribution of Cu NPs on the surface of ZnO. This composite also showed good catalytic performance in the reduction of organic dyes such as methylene blue, Congo red, and acriavine hydrochloride. The Cu/0DZnO nanocomposite could be easily recycled with just a minor change in its catalytic activity, indicating its potential for use at a broad scale in chemical process industries.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).
