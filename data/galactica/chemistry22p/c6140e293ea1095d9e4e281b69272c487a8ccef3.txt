conclusions One of the most prominent medical concerns in the world today is related to NDDs for which no definite treatment has yet been suggested. With an aging population and an increase in environmental risk factors due to industry, incidences of NDDs are on the rise. Therefore, research has focused on alternatives to pharmacological medicine that can only relieve patients’ symptoms rather than on finding a method that can prevent the occurrence of NDDs and slow down disease progression. Considering the role of inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurodegeneratio in the pathogenesis of NDDs, the therapeutic a d p eventive r les of s veral antioxidative agents, including nutritional and herbal medicines, have been investigated in cellular and molecular studies. Picein is one of the active compounds of several plants and herbs with a potential for neuroprotection. Salix, an aspirin precursor, has shown significant anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties, and picein is one of the phenolic compounds that can be extracted from the water extract of willow bark. In a previous study, our team has shown that treatment of NB SH-SY5Y cells with picein decreased the menadioneinduced ROS levels an recovere mitochondrial activity to normal, indicating the potential of picein as a neuroprotecti agent. However, there are no other studies on the direct neuroprotective effect of picein. A few studies have reported the antioxidative properties of Salix Sp. based on the extracted compounds in cellular models but failed to indicate any favorable effect for the picein compound. Picrorhiza kurroa is another herb from which picein is extracted. However, the one study that evaluated the effect of the extracted picein from this herb failed to show anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties for this compound. These studies do not provide sufficient evidence for a definite conclusion, either for the anti-inflammat ry and anti xidative properties of picein or its neuroprotective potential. Picein has also shown favorable antifu gal and ibacteria properties in spruce trees. Although these plant studies can be appropriate evidence for further studies, no studies have evaluated the effects of the picein extracted from these plants on other cells; therefore, we cannot draw definite conclusions in this regard. 7. future directions The treatment of NDDs s still a major concern and t apeutic agents that tackle the pathophysiology of the disease are required or ef ectiv treatment. In the present review, we presented evidence from a few studies that confirm the antioxidative and neuroprotective role of picein in addition to its lack of cytotoxicity. Therefore, this plant-

derived natural biomolecule may be a safe and effective agent for the treatment of NDDs. Nonetheless, the number of studies is limited in this regard and more studies are required on animals to prove these properties and propose this agent as a novel therapeutic agent. We also recognize the delivery challenges of transiting drug molecules across the blood–brain barrier in the treatment of NDDs and methods addressing this issue are being developed in parallel to the discovery of new, promising compounds for the same.
