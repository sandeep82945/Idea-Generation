    "abstractText": "In this work, cotton stalks (Gossypium barbadense) and date palm stones (Phoenix dactylifera) have been used as biosorbents to remove cadmium; Cd(II), lead; Pb(II), and zinc; Zn(II) from monoand multi-solutions. Each biosorbent was characterized using SEM-EDX, and FT-IR. The findings showed that pH, dose, contact time, metal concentration, and particle size affect the treatment process. The adsorption pattern was Pb(II) > Cd(II) > Zn(II) for both biosorbents. The adsorption performance of cotton stalks was higher than that of date palm stones. The fitted maximum uptake capacities; qm of cotton stalks were higher than those of date palm stones. The maximum adsorption at optimum conditions of Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II) with cotton stalks were 98%, 92.1%, and 78.9%, respectively, within 30 min. While the maximum adsorption of Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II) with date palm stones were 94.6%, 76%, and 68.6%, respectively. Results confirmed the antagonistic effect of heavy metal removal at optimum conditions. Biosorbents could remove ~ 100% of the metal ions from real wastewater samples. Regeneration investigation revealed a successful reusability of both biosorbents for four cycles.",

            "text": "Shortage and lacking freshwater are one of the main challenges in agriculture and food security fields. Out of 800 million people in North Africa, ~ 300 million reside in areas with limited access to water resources (Mayaux et\u00a0al. 2022; Radingoana et\u00a0al. 2020). Reusing agricultural drainage water\ncan be an ideal solution to solve irrigation water insufficiency. Due to salinity issues, reused drainage water quality is extremely important, particularly in arid regions like Egypt (Ashour et\u00a0al. 2021; Ezzat and Elkorashey 2020). Consequently, integrated water and wastewater management/reuse are needed urgently for sustainable practices. Wastewater treated to the proper quality can replenish water supplies and diminish the acute gap between demand and availability in view of climate change impact (Dotaniya et\u00a0al. 2022; Mahmoud et\u00a0al. 2021c). However, heavy metals are generated from a vast array of industrial activities and reach the aquatic ecosystems to be accumulated in aquatic habitats.\nHeavy metals are dangerous even if they have been found in traces in real wastewater effluents. Heavy metals were frequently found, including cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, and zinc, in agriculture wastewater as used in manufacturing of pesticides and herbicides. Cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), the most frequent harmful heavy metals, are known as the \u201cbig three\u201d heavy metals, along with mercury (Kahlon et\u00a0al. 2018). Furthermore, zinc (Zn) is one of the most often found heavy metals in acid mine drainage and industrial effluents from galvanizing facilities (Pratap et\u00a0al. 2022). Despite the\nResponsible Editor: Tito Roberto Cadaval Jr\n* Alaa El Din Mahmoud alaa-mahmoud@alexu.edu.eg\n1 Environmental Sciences Department, Faculty of\u00a0Science, Alexandria University, Alexandria\u00a021511, Egypt\n2 Green Technology Group, Faculty of\u00a0Science, Alexandria University, Alexandria\u00a021511, Egypt\n3 National Biotechnology Network of\u00a0Expertise (NBNE), Academy of\u00a0Scientific Research and\u00a0Technology (ASRT), Cairo, Egypt\n4 Plant Protection and\u00a0Biomolecular Diagnosis, Arid Lands Cultivation Research Institute (ALCRI), City of\u00a0Scientific Research and\u00a0Technological Applications (SRTA-City), Alexandria\u00a021934, Egypt\n1 3\nfact that Zn is a necessary trace element for living organisms, it is poisonous to them at millimolar doses.\nHence, the removal of these elements from wastewater to be reused is still a challenge in view of high tertiary treatment cost. The majority of conventional wastewater treatment methods (including reverse osmosis, ion exchange, and precipitation) possess limitations in most industrial applications. This can be due to high capital with complexity to operate, low selectivity, and energy costs. Hence, they are limiting factors in water reuse.\nBiosorption process can be the green technology for wastewater treatment. It has great effectiveness in sequestering dissolved metals from solutions with diluted concentrations. Because of its procedure over a wide range of temperature and pH without releasing secondary contaminants, biosorption is an appropriate technology for treating lowconcentration and high-volume wastewaters (Sathya et\u00a0al. 2022; Vijayaraghavan and Balasubramanian 2015). Many kinds of biomasses were used as biosorbents for heavy metal removal. For instance, citrus Sinensis peel (El Malti et\u00a0al. 2022), bamboo sawdust/rice husk (Kwikima et\u00a0al. 2022), rice straw (Ameen Hezam Saeed et\u00a0al. 2022; Nasr et\u00a0al. 2017), and orange peel (Priyadharshini and Abraham 2022) were applied for the elimination of cadmium (Cd). Wheat stem biomass (Jalali et\u00a0al. 2021), common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) (Salazar-Pinto et\u00a0al. 2021), and rice straw (Xu et\u00a0al. 2021) were tested for lead (Pb) adsorption. Other biomasses, such as lemon, watermelon, pineapple, and banana peels (Y\u0131lmaz and Tugrul 2021), were used for zinc elimination from water.\nThe regeneration possibility of the biosorbents is a critical step to evaluating their performances and feasibility in real wastewater applications. Effective water treatment and reuse applications can deliver environmental and socioeconomic benefits. Therefore, using locally available agricultural wastes such as date palm stones and cotton stalks as biosorbents possess dual benefits: minimizing biological waste and providing a cost-effective solution for water pollution.\nIt is worth noting that there is still an insufficient comparative study of various agricultural byproducts as biosorbents and few investigations on multi-metal solutions and real wastewater to simulate the actual conditions in the treatment process. The main goal of this work is to test the possibility of using locally available agricultural wastes for the tertiary treatment of wastewater to be reused for agricultural purposes. The objectives are to (1) evaluate the biosorption potentialities of cotton stalks and date palm stones for Cd(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II) in mono- and multi-metal solutions, (2) optimize the environmental factors controlling the biosorption process, (3) investigate the recyclability of the investigated biosorbents, and (4) evaluate the effectiveness of the investigated biosorbents using real wastewater."

A remarkable shift was recorded for hydroxyl group (\u2013OH) stretching. The (\u2013OH) peaks showed a shift from 3337.1 to 3324.7 (Cd(II)), 3328.9 (Pb(II)), and 3332.1\u00a0 cm\u22121 (Zn(II)). The shift from 2917.2 to 2913.7 and 2917.2\u00a0 cm\u22121 for Cd(II) and Pb(II), respectively, and disappeared for Zn (II) were assigned to aliphatic acid\u2019s C\u2013H stretching vibration (Subbaiah Munagapati et\u00a0al. 2022).\nA pronounced shift was recorded at 1733.7\u00a0 cm\u22121, which shifted to 1734.2, 1733.5, and 1733.8\u00a0 cm\u22121 for Cd(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II), respectively, corresponding to stretching vibration of C = O bond which found in carboxylic acids or esters (\u2013COOH or \u2013COOCH3). This shift associated with another shift from 1235.3 to 1234.5, 1235.3, and 1234.1\u00a0 cm\u22121, which may assign to C\u2013O stretching, this observation may confirm the presence of carboxylic ester. Shifted bands from 1644.9 to 16531.1 and 1653.3 for Pb(II) and Zn(II), respectively, were assigned to an asymmetric stretching of \u2013COO\u2013 in ionic carboxylic group, while shifted bands from 1457.1 to 1457.6 (Cd(II)), 1457.3 (Pb(II)), and 1457.5\u00a0 cm\u22121 (Zn(II)) were assigned to symmetric \u2013COO\u2013 stretching in pectin (Iqbal et\u00a0al. 2009).

This happens as a result of an increment in the ions number contending for the available active sites on the surface of the biosorbents (Mahmoud et\u00a0al. 2021b).\nApplying cotton stalks as a biosorbent with different metal ion concentrations (Fig.\u00a04e), Pb(II) and Cd(II) ions removal decreased from 95.48 and 91.02% to 90.34 and 78.64% with increasing the concentrations from 10 to 50\u00a0mg L\u22121.

The adsorption removal of the studied metal ions was 1.1\u20131.2 higher than those of cotton stalks at \u02c3\u00a00.5\u00a0mm. While the removal of Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II) were 1.14, 1.27, and 1.59 higher than those of date palm stones at \u02c3\u00a00.5\u00a0mm. Hence, the smaller the particle size of biosorbent, the greater its surface area, resultant increase in the binding sites for adsorption (Wang et\u00a0al. 2022).\nInfluence of\u00a0pH\npH is a key aspect because it has an impact on how heavy metals are sequestered onto the surface of the biosorbent (Mahmoud 2020). As a result, the sorbent functional groups\nor the targeted elements in the water may have been ionized (Yang et\u00a0al. 2016).\nThe pH effects on the biosorption behavior of both biosorbents for the metal ions were evaluated within pH 2\u20138, as demonstrated in Fig.\u00a05a and b. The optimum pH of the solution was found at 6 for the investigated heavy metal ions. Because the metal ions can exist in their free state and their hydroxide precipitation form can be disregarded, this pH value was chosen (Fertu et\u00a0al. 2022).\nDue to the presence of additional H+ ions, which compete with the metal ions for biosorption sites, the absorption of metal ions in the acidic medium was restricted at low values of pH \u02c2 4. However, at higher pH levels, the metal ion was about to hydrolyze and create metal hydroxide deposition (Qasem et\u00a0al. 2021; Wallace et\u00a0al. 2022). This is due to the colloidal form formation of heavy metals with OH\u2212 in the aqueous media. Therefore, the quantity removed, qe, and % removal of Cd(II), Pb(II), and Zn (II) of the used biosorbent are clearly arranged at the optimum condition in the following order: Pb(II) > Cd(II) > Zn(II). It is found that Pb(II) in a single solution is the highest removal efficiency (83%) with tea pulp at pH = 6 (Pasgar et\u00a0al. 2022)."

Such increment in the removal percentage of the studied metals with increment in the biosorbent dose can be associated with the more available binding sites. Afterward, the removal slowly achieved stability. Such findings are reported by Chen et\u00a0al. (2022), where the modified biochar dosage was more than 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75\u00a0mg with Pb(II), Zn(II), and Cd(II), respectively. The\n1 3\ndecreasing removal percentage of Zn(II) with a further increment of biosorbent dose could be due to the effect of particle concentration, which is driven by interactions between particles. These interactions may physically deny some adsorption sites to the adsorbing solutes in a system\nwith a higher solid content, resulting in reduced R%, or the electrical surface charges on the densely packed particles reduce the attractive forces between the surfaces of the biosorbent and the adsorbing solutes, resulting in electrostatic interferences (Afroze et\u00a0al. 2016).\n1 3\nOn the other hand, the uptake capacities of the metals were decreased with increasing the biosorbent doses (Fig.\u00a05d and f). Such behavior can be explicated by Eq.\u00a0(4) (Abdelfatah et\u00a0al. 2022; El-Maghrabi et\u00a0al. 2022; Mahmoud et\u00a0al. 2022a).\nEquation\u00a04 demonstrates the inverse relation of uptake capacity to biosorbent dose. Hence, the increment of\n(4)qe = ( R \u00d7 C0\u2215W ) \u00d7 100\nW causes decrement in qe at fixed C0.

The Langmuir model\u2019s high correlation coefficient attests to its suitability for fitting experimental data.\nThe values of KL for Pb(II) adsorption by cotton stakes and date palm stones are higher than those values for Cd(II) and Zn(II).

(ii) In comparison to Cd(II) and Zn(II), whose respective hydrated radii are 0.426 and 0.430\u00a0nm, Pb(II) has a smaller hydrated radius (0.401\u00a0nm). (iii) In comparison to Cd(II) (1.69) and Zn(II), Pb(II) has a higher electronegativity of 2.10 (1.65). (iv) The larger unhydrated ions have a lower charge density and less grip on the hydration water, which results in a weaker link between the metal ion and water phase.\nPhysical adsorption could be happened due to a weak Van der Waal\u2019s force. The presence of carbonyl/carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the biosorbents has a role in the binding of heavy metallic cations, as reported in Esfandian et\u00a0al. (2023). The adsorption mechanism could be (i) surface complexation where reactions occurred at the surface functional group X-OH (Mahmoud et\u00a0al. 2016); (ii) ion exchange where K and Ca disappeared after the biosorption process, as depicted in EDX results; (iii) pore filling, where surface and film diffusion adsorption has a role in the uptake process as shown in Fig.\u00a06c and f.

(2022) several physicochemical processes are involved in the adsorption of heavy metal ions by agricultural wastebased biosorbents, involving ion exchange, complexation, physisorption, and intra-particle diffusion.\nIn addition, each metal ion behavior could be attributed to the mutual and varied inhibitory effects on the sorption of the metal ions in ternary solutions.

Figure\u00a010 shows a gradual decrease in Cd(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II) removal efficiencies from multi-metal solution with an increasing number of cycles.

It is noticed that the biomass of cotton stalk could be recycled up to 3 times for Cd(II), 4 times for Pb(II), and 2 times for Zn(II) ions with accepted efficiency loss (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2020).\nA significant portion of the metal ions adsorbed and turned into irreversible sorption, and the biosorbent load capacity is lost for the repeated adsorption-desorption cycles, according to the minor decline in removal efficiency after each cycle. The sequence of desorption was Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn (II). This results from a more efficient interchange of Zn(II) with the ions present in the surface functional groups of the biomass during the adsorption process. Pb(II) ions are easier to desorb because, due\nto their bigger size, they do not permeate pores and channels to the same extent as Zn(II) ions.

The fitted kinetic model was pseudo-second-order with R2 > 0.99 along with the intra-particle diffusion model to prove that adsorption is a rate-limited process. The adsorption\n1 3\nisotherm is favorable because separation factor values were in the range of 0\u20131. The competition between the targeted metal ions was linked to the decrease in removal of multi-metal solutions compared to mono-metal ones. This highlights the significance of investigating the biosorption efficiencies and capacities of biosorbents with other coexisting heavy metals. The calculated Rsa confirmed the antagonistic behavior of the interaction between the multi-metal solutions at optimum conditions. In the real wastewater application, cotton stalks and date palm dates were found to be effective in removing heavy metal ions completely. Successful four adsorption-desorption cycles were conducted. The possibility of biosorbent regeneration with several cycles gives a good opportunity for metals recovery in the aspects of circular economy. In view of their availability, cotton stalks and date palm stones could be considered excellent candidates for the removal of heavy metals from wastewater.\nSupplementary information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11356- 023- 27137-4.\nAuthor contribution Heba Nagy: investigation, methodology, data curation, visualization, and writing\u2014original draft.
