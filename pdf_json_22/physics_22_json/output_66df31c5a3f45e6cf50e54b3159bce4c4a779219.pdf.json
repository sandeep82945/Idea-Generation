The theory of disordered heterogeneous media provides an array of theoretical and computational techniques to characterize a wide class of complex material microstructures. In this work, we apply them to describe the disordered distributions of galaxies obtained from recent suites of dark matter simulations. We focus on the determination of lower-order correlation functions, void and particle nearestneighbor functions, certain cluster statistics, pair-connectedness functions, percolation properties, and a scalar ordermetric to quantify the degree of order. Compared to analogous homogeneous Poisson and typical disordered systems, the cosmological simulations exhibit enhanced large-scale clustering and longer tails in the void and particle nearest-neighbor functions, due to the presence of quasi-long-range correlations imprinted by early Universe physics, with a minimum particle separation far below the mean nearestneighbor distance. On large scales, the system appears hyperuniform, as a result of primordial density fluctuations, while on the smallest scales, the system becomes almost antihyperuniform, as evidenced by its number variance. Additionally, via a finite-scaling analysis, we compute the percolation threshold of the galaxy catalogs, finding this to be significantly lower than for Poisson realizations (at reduced density \u03b7c \u00bc 0.25 in our fiducial analysis compared to \u03b7c \u00bc 0.34), with strong dependence on the mean density; this is consistent with the observation that the galaxy distribution contains voids of up to 50% larger radius. However, the two sets of simulations appear to share the same fractal dimension on scales much larger than the average intergalaxy separation, implying that they lie in the same universality class.We also show that the distribution of galaxies is a highly correlated disordered system (relative to the uncorrelated Poisson distribution), as measured by the \u03c4 order metric. Finally, we consider the ability of large-scale clustering statistics to constrain cosmological parameters, such as the Universe\u2019s expansion rate, using simulationbased inference. Both the nearest-neighbor distribution and pair-connectedness function (which includes contributions from correlation functions of all order) are found to considerably tighten bounds on the amplitude of quantum-mechanical fluctuations from inflation at a level equivalent to observing 25 times more galaxies. The pair-connectedness function in particular provides a useful alternative to the standard three-particle correlation, since it contains similar large-scale information to the three-point function, can be computed highly efficiently, and can be straightforwardly extended to small scales (though likely requires simulation-based modeling). This work provides the first application of such techniques to cosmology, providing both a novel system to test heterogeneous media descriptors and a tranche of new tools for cosmological analyses. A range of extensions are possible, including implementation on observational data; this will require further study on various observational effects, necessitating high-resolution simulations.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevX.13.011038 Subject Areas: Astrophysics, Complex Systems, Statistical Physics\n*ohep2@cantab.ac.uk \u2020torquato@electron.princeton.edu\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

INTRODUCTION\nFrom condensed phases of matter to ecological systems to the primordial distribution of matter in the Universe, nature abounds with examples of disordered arrangements of interacting entities that form structures with diverse geometries and topologies. To understand the collective behavior of such phenomena, it is vital to have a mathematical formalism that enables a stochastic description of the constituent objects, particularly with regards to their spatial distribution and clustering, whether they be carbon atoms, concrete conglomerates, or individual galaxies. The theory of disordered heterogeneous media [1,2], which includes techniques from statistical mechanics [3], provides a natural and powerful machinery with which to equip ourselves in this venture. In particular, its primary objective is to connect the properties of the interacting constituents to their large-scale attributes, such as a material\u2019s bulk transport and mechanical and electromagnetic properties. This is rigorously done by generally relating the bulk properties to an infinite set of diverse types of statistical correlation functions that characterize the microstructures [1], including those that contain topological information, such as phase connectivity and percolation characteristics. While this theoretical machinery has been primarily applied to Earth-bound materials, their applicability is far from terrestrial: these techniques work similarly for any phenomenon that can be treated as complex disordered heterogeneous media [1], including the spatial distribution and clustering of galaxies. While the bulk of cosmological research in the past two decades has focused on analysis of the cosmic microwave background (the radiation signature of physics in the first \u223c300 000 years, which provides a snapshot of the early Universe), that concerning the distribution of galaxies using statistical descriptors has become progressively more important [4\u20136], particularly with the advent of largescale surveys, such as the forthcoming Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) [7] and the Euclid satellite [8]. The distribution of galaxies traces the distribution of matter in the early Universe (see, e.g., Ref. [4]); as such, it encodes information on a wealth of cosmological parameters, such as the density of matter. An open question is how best to analyze the data: most works focus on measuring the correlation functions of the galaxy distribution and comparing them to physical models (either explicitly derived or numerically simulated) (see, e.g., Ref. [9]), though this is known to be suboptimal in terms of information content. While a number of alternative statistics have been proposed (including void statistics [10,11], marked density fields [12\u201315], Gaussianized fields [16\u201319], reconstructed density fields [20] field-level inference [21\u201323], Minkowski functionals and other topological descriptors [24\u201333], and beyond), there is little consensus on which have practical utility (with most having been applied only to the dark matter distribution), and few are\nnatural from a theoretical standpoint. An important insight is that the galaxy distribution is simply a set of irregularly arranged pointlike particles in three dimensions; this is mathematically identical to the structure of many terrestrial materials, including atomic systems, colloids, and sphere packing. As such, both scenarios can be treated with the same mathematical formalisms; i.e., heterogeneous media and statistical mechanical techniques designed to quantify the clustering of particles in materials can be used to provide a practical and well-motivated manner in which to understand the galaxy distribution. This work considers the application of a number of statistical descriptors from the theory of disordered heterogeneous media to characterize structurally the distribution of galaxies, which we treat as discrete point configuration. We ask two main questions. (1) What can we learn about cosmology through the lens of disordered heterogenous media and statistical mechanics? (2) What condensed matter physics lessons, more broadly, can we learn from cosmological structures? As a proof of concept, we will consider a number of descriptors [1,4], including the twoand three-particle correlation functions, \u201cvoid\u201d and \u201cparticle\u201d nearest-neighbor functions, certain cluster statistics, pair-connectedness functions, percolation properties, and scalar ordermetrics to quantify the degree of order.We show how their behaviors in the cosmic landscape, probed through cosmological dark matter simulations, differs substantially from that expected from a simple Poissonian distribution of points as well as well-known homogeneous models of correlated disordered point patterns, showing that cosmology challenges general expectations of standard heterogeneous media and statistical mechanical models. In particular, we will find stronger clustering on large scales, giving an enhancement in the pair correlation and pairconnectedness functions and an excess of large-scale voids; these effects arise due to early Universe physics, which source quasi-long-range correlations in the galaxy distribution and create a hyperuniform system. Particular interest will be paid to the question of clustering and phase \u201cpercolation\u201d; this is a well-understood phenomenon for many models in condensed matter but can be similarly extended to galaxy distributions, and yields interesting results. The cosmological case will be found to percolate faster, but asymptote to the Poisson case if the density is low, and both scenarios share the same set of critical exponents. Furthermore, wewill consider the utility of descriptors from the theory of disordered heterogeneous media in cosmological settings, quantifying how they can add additional information regarding the early and late Universe, finding that the pair-connectedness function adds significant cosmological information at minimal additional computational cost. We caution that further work will be required before the statistics can be applied to observational data: this must include discussion of redshift-space effects (arising from the conversion of galaxy redshifts to distance, creating\n011038-2\nanisotropy with respect to the sample line of sight) and the dependence of descriptors on galaxy properties, such as luminosities or masses. Our conclusions to the above questions asked will be the following: (1) the theory of heterogeneous media and statistical mechanics provides an array of useful tools that can enhance the utility of galaxy survey datasets, strengthening the constraints on cosmological parameters and probing novel features of the distribution, (2) due to its quasi-long-ranged correlations, galaxy samples exhibit very different behavior to most terrestrial media, and thus provide an important sandbox for applying and understanding condensed matter techniques. While we restrict ourselves to galaxy surveys in this work, they are by no means the only cosmological application of such statistics: a number of other phenomena could be described by such approaches. These include two-phase media such as the distribution of cosmic voids (empty regions of gargantuan extent) and the statistics of ionized hydrogen bubbles during the \u201creionization\u201d phase of the Universe. Such areas provide a bountiful mine from which to derive future work. The remainder of this work is structured as follows. In Sec. II, we provide an overview of the statistics used in this work, before presenting the proposed testing ground (simulated galaxy samples) in Sec. III. A comparison of the statistics on galactic and Poisson data is shown in Sec. II, with Sec. V providing a discussion of percolation physics in the two systems. Finally, Sec. VI considers the utility of a specific statistic, the pair-connectedness function, in cosmological contexts, before we conclude in Sec. VII."

Of more practical use is the n-particle probability density function, marginalized over\nthe positions of the other \u00f0N \u2212 n\u00de \u2265 0 particles: this is defined as\n\u03c1n\u00f0r1;\u2026;rn\u00de \u00bc N!\u00f0N\u2212n\u00de!

More generally, for statistically homogeneous systems, \u03c1n\u00f0r1;\u2026; rn\u00de is translationally invariant, enabling us to reexpress it as follows:\n\u03c1n\u00f0r1;\u2026; rn\u00de \u00bc \u03c1\u0304ngn\u00f0r12;\u2026; r1n\u00de; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere gn\u00f0r12;\u2026; r1n\u00de is the n-particle correlation function (closely related to the cosmologists\u2019 n-point correlation function), which depends on the relative positions r12;\u2026, where rij \u2261 rj \u2212 ri. The two-particle or pair correlation\n011038-3\nfunction g2 is particularly important in applications, and is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. For translationally invariant point configurations without long-range order, gn\u00f0r12;\u2026; r1n\u00de \u2192 1 when the points (or particles) are mutually far from one another, i.e., as jrijj\u2192\u221e (1\u2264 i < j<n), \u03c1n\u00f0r1; r2;\u2026; rn\u00de \u2192 \u03c1n. Thus, the deviation of gn from unity provides a measure of the degree of spatial correlations (positive or negative) between the particles. Note that for a translationally invariant Poisson (spatially uncorrelated) point configurations, gn \u00bc 1 is unity for all values of its argument. If the point configuration is in addition statistically isotropic, the functions gn are invariant under joint rotations of rij, such that g2 is a function only of jr12j\u2261 r12, and g3 depends only on r12, r13 and r23 [34]. In cosmology it is commonplace to consider not the probability density function of the full ensemble, but a set of realizations of the microscopic density (often known as the density field), each denoted by \u03c1\u0302\u00f0r\u00de. This gives the probability that there is a particle within dr of r for a specific field (for sufficiently small dr), and can be represented as a sum of N Dirac deltas: \u03c1\u0302\u00f0r\u00de \u00bc PNi\u00bc1 \u03b4D\u00f0r \u2212 xi\u00de. Averaging over realizations (denoted by the expectation operatorE), we can relate \u03c1\u0302\u00f0r\u00de to then-particle probability density functions:\nE\u00bd\u03c1\u0302\u00f0r1\u00de\u2026\u03c1\u0302\u00f0rn\u00de \u2261 \u03c1n\u00f0r1;\u2026; rn\u00de: \u00f03\u00de If the field is statistically homogeneous, and the volume (i.e., R dr) sufficiently large, this is equivalent to a spatial\naverage via the ergodic principle. In cosmological contexts, Eq. (3) is usually adopted, with \u03c1\u0302\u00f0r\u00de often referred to as \u03c1\u0304\u00bd1\u00fe \u03b4\u00f0r\u00de for overdensity field \u03b4. Additionally, it is conventional to work with disconnected correlation functions \u03be\u00f0n\u00de, often known as n-point correlation functions: the first few satisfy\n\u03be\u00f02\u00de\u00f0r12\u00de\u2261 E\u00bd\u03b4\u00f0r1\u00de\u03b4\u00f0r2\u00de \u2261 g2\u00f0r12\u00de \u2212 1; \u03be\u00f03\u00de\u00f0r12; r13; r23\u00de\u2261 E\u00bd\u03b4\u00f0r1\u00de\u03b4\u00f0r2\u00de\u03b4\u00f0r3\u00de\n\u2261 g3\u00f0r12; r13; r23\u00de \u2212 g2\u00f0r12\u00de \u2212 g2\u00f0r13\u00de \u2212 g2\u00f0r23\u00de \u00fe 2; \u00f04\u00de\nsee Ref. [4], and are all zero under Poisson statistics. We will principally work with the full gn functions in this work, adopting statistical mechanics conventions. A particularly important descriptor is the structure factor S\u00f0k\u00de, which is related to the Fourier transform of the total correlation function h\u00f0r\u00de\u2261 g2\u00f0r\u00de \u2212 1:\nS\u00f0k\u00de\u2261 1\u00fe \u03c1\u0304 h\u0303\u00f0k\u00de\u2261 1\u00fe \u03c1\u0304 Z dreik\u00b7r\u00bdh\u00f0r\u00de : \u00f05\u00de\nFor a Poisson point distribution, S\u00f0k\u00de \u00bc 1 for all k. The structure factor and the cosmologists\u2019 power spectrum [4] P\u00f0k\u00de are trivially related to one another via S\u00f0k\u00de \u00bc \u03c1\u0304P\u00f0k\u00de.\nThe structure factor provides a useful way to quantify large-scale (low wave number k\u2261 jkj) correlation and fluctuation properties of a point configuration and plays a central role in the hyperuniformity concept. Hyperuniform states of matter are correlated systems that are characterized by an anomalous suppression of long-wavelength (i.e., large length scale) density fluctuations compared to those found in garden-variety disordered systems, such as ordinary fluids and amorphous solids [35,36]. A hyperuniform (or superhomogeneous [37]) many-particle system in d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd is one in which (normalized) density fluctuations are completely suppressed at very large length scales, implying that the structure factor S\u00f0k\u00de tends to zero in the infinitewavelength limit, i.e.,\nlim jkj\u21920\nS\u00f0k\u00de \u00bc 0: \u00f06\u00de\nEquivalently, a hyperuniform system is one in which the number variance \u03c32N\u00f0R\u00de\u2261 hN\u00f0R\u00de2i \u2212 hN\u00f0R\u00dei2 of particles within a spherical observation window of radius R grows more slowly than the window volume in the large-R limit, i.e., slower than Rd. Typical disordered systems, such as liquids and structural glasses, have the standard asymptotic volume scaling \u03c32N\u00f0R\u00de \u223c Rd and hence are not hyperuniform. For general translationally invariant point configation in Rd, the local number variance \u03c32N\u00f0R\u00de is determined exactly by the pair statistics [35]:\n\u03c32N\u00f0R\u00de \u00bc \u03c1\u0304v1\u00f0R\u00de 1\u00fe \u03c1 Z Rd h\u00f0r\u00de\u03b1\u00f0r;R\u00dedr\n\u00bc \u03c1\u0304v1\u00f0R\u00de\n1 \u00f02\u03c0\u00ded Z Rd S\u00f0k\u00de\u03b1\u0303\u00f0k;R\u00dedk ; \u00f07\u00de\nwhere v1\u00f0R\u00de \u00bc \u03c0d=2Rd=\u0393\u00f01\u00fe d=2\u00de is the volume of a d-dimensional sphere of radius R, and \u03b1\u00f0r;R\u00de is the scaled intersection volume, the ratio of the intersection volume of two spherical windows of radius R whose centers are separated by a distance r to the volume of a spherical window, known analytically in any space dimension [1,38]. Its Fourier transform is the non-negative function given by\n\u03b1\u0303\u00f0k;R\u00de \u00bc 2d\u03c0d=2\u0393\u00f01\u00fe d=2\u00de \u00bdJd=2\u00f0kR\u00de 2\nkd ; \u00f08\u00de\nwhere J\u03bd\u00f0x\u00de is the Bessel function of order \u03bd. Consider translationally invariant point configurations that are characterized by a structure factor with a radial power-law form in the vicinity of the origin, i.e.,\nS\u00f0k\u00de \u223c jkj\u03b1 for jkj \u2192 0: \u00f09\u00de\nFor hyperuniform systems, the exponent \u03b1 is positive (\u03b1 > 0) and its value determines three hyperuniformity\n011038-4\nclasses corresponding to different large-R scaling behaviors of the number variance [35,36,39]:\n\u03c32\u00f0R\u00de \u223c 8><>: Rd\u22121 \u03b1 > 1 \u00f0class I\u00de Rd\u22121 lnR \u03b1 \u00bc 1 \u00f0class II\u00de Rd\u2212\u03b1 \u03b1 < 1 \u00f0class III\u00de:\n\u00f010\u00de\nClasses I and III describe the strongest and weakest forms of hyperuniformity, respectively. States of matter that belong to class I include all perfect crystals [35,39], many perfect quasicrystals [39\u201341], \u201crandomly\u201d perturbed crystal structures [42\u201345], classical disordered ground states of matter [35,46,47], as well as systems out of equilibrium [48,49]. Class II hyperuniform systems include some quasicrystals [41], the positions of the prime numbers [50], and many disordered classical [48,51\u201354] and quantum [55\u201357] states of matter. Examples of class III hyperuniform systems include classical disordered ground states [58], random organization models [59] and perfect glasses [48]. Certain disordered hyperuniform systems are poised at an \u201cinverted\u201d critical point in which the volume integral of the total correlation function h\u00f0r\u00de is quasi-long-ranged but its volume integral is bounded [35,36]. By contrast, for any nonhyperuniform system, the local variance has the following large-R scaling behaviors [60]:\n\u03c32\u00f0R\u00de \u223c ( Rd \u03b1 \u00bc 0 \u00f0typical nonhyperuniform\u00de Rd\u2212\u03b1 \u2212d < \u03b1 < 0 \u00f0antihyperuniform\u00de: \u00f011\u00de\nFor a typical nonhyperuniform system, the structure factor S\u00f00\u00de is bounded [36]. In antihyperuniform systems, S\u00f00\u00de is unbounded, i.e.,\nlim jkj\u21920\nS\u00f0k\u00de \u00bc \u00fe\u221e; \u00f012\u00de\nand hence are diametrically opposite to hyperuniform systems. Antihyperuniform systems include fractals, systems at thermal critical points (e.g., liquid-vapor and magnetic critical points) [61\u201365], as well as certain substitution tilings [66]."

            "text": "Given the richness of the spectrum of possible microstructures that can arise in condensed phase systems, an outstanding challenging task has been the quantification of their degree order or disorder. Scalar order or disorder metrics have been profitably employed to quantify the degree of order in many-particle systems, including sphere packings; see Refs. [1,67] and references therein. Any\nscalar order metric \u03a8\u00f0R\u00de is a well-defined non-negative scalar function of a many-particle configuration R and if, for any two configurations RA and RB, \u03a8\u00f0RA\u00de > \u03a8\u00f0RB\u00de, we say that configuration RA is to be considered more ordered than configurationRB. It has been suggested that a good scalar order metric should have the following additional properties [68]: (1) sensitivity to any type of ordering without bias toward any reference system, (2) ability to reflect the hierarchy of ordering between prototypical systems given by common physical intuition (e.g., perfect crystals with high symmetry should be highly ordered, followed by quasicrystals, correlated disordered packings without long-range order, and finally spatially uncorrelated or Poisson distributed particles), (3) capacity to detect order at any length scale, and (4) incorporation of both the variety of local coordination patterns and the spatial distribution of such patterns. The recently introduced \u03c4 order metric [47] fulfills these requirements and has been fruitfully employed to characterize the degree of order across length scales of a diverse set of disordered media [47,69\u201371]. This metric, which we compute here for the first time for the galaxies, is defined as\n\u03c4 \u00bc 1 Dd Z Rd drh2\u00f0r\u00de\n\u00bc 1\u00f02\u03c0\u00dedDd\u03c1\u03042 Z Rd dk\u00bdS\u00f0k\u00de \u2212 1 2; \u00f013\u00de\nwhereD is a characteristic \u201cmicroscopic\u201d length scale. This scalar metric measures deviations of two-particle statistics from that of the Poisson distribution. Since both positive and negative correlations contribute to the integral, due to the fact that h\u00f0r\u00de is squared, \u03c4 measures the degree of translational order across length scales. It clearly vanishes for the uncorrelated Poisson distribution, diverges for an infinite crystal, and is a positive bounded number for correlated disordered systems without long-range order (i.e., Bragg peaks). It is interesting to note that the \u03c4 order metric is closely related to the negative of the excess twoparticle entropy of the system [72]."

The void nearest-neighbor function HV has received some attention in cosmology, both historically [74\u201376] and in recent works, in particular via the \u201ckNN\u201d statistics [77\u201380], generalizing the above to the kth nearest neighbor. This has been shown to yield strong constraints on cosmological parameters (cf. Sec. VI) and can be modeled semianalytically. It is noteworthy that kNN statistics and related quantities have been studied and fruitfully applied in the field of statistical mechanics [81\u201384]. Both the void and particle nearest-neighbor functions generally involve integrals over all the n-particle correlation functions, fgng (n \u00bc 2; 3; 4;\u2026) [73,77]. While the void and particle nearest-neighbor functions are identical to one another for a Poisson point configuration [e.g., EV\u00f0r\u00de \u00bc EP\u00f0r\u00de \u00bc exp\u00f0\u22124\u03c0r3\u03c1\u0304=3\u00de in three dimensions],\nthey are generally different from one another for correlated systems, as manifested by their different series representations [73]. Both the void and particle quantities arise in rigorous bounds on the effective transport and mechanical properties of heterogeneous media [1]. It is noteworthy that the void nearest-neighbor functions play a deep role in the covering problem of discrete geometry [85]. The covering problem asks for the point configuration that minimizes the radius of overlapping spheres circumscribed around each of the points required to cover d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd [86]. The above void statistic also bears some similarities to the \u201cvoid size function\u201d used in cosmology [10,87]. The latter quantity is usually constructed from smoothed density fields, with voids identified as spherical regions with a mean density below some critical threshold, usually 30% of the system\u2019s mean density. This differs from HV in two key ways: (a) the voids defined by Eq. (14) contain no particles, thus they are equivalent to requiring a critical density of zero, (b) the cosmologists\u2019 void contains no subvoids: i.e., any empty area of space within a void cannot be classified as a smaller void, unlike for HV."

            "heading": "D. Clustering and connectedness functions",
            "text": "To quantify the geometrical and topological properties of the class of disordered heterogeneous media consisting of particles distributed throughout a matrix phase, it is often useful to statistically characterize particle clusters that are defined according to some connectivity criterion [1,88\u201392] For point (zero-dimensional) particles, this can be achieved by circumscribing each point by spheres of diameter D, which generally may overlap with one another. Such a decoration of the points by possibly overlapping spheres divides the space into two disjoint regions or \u201cphases,\u201d encompassing points that do and do not lie within a distanceD=2 of at least one point. Two spheres are deemed to be connected if they overlap. Defining the reduced density \u03b7\u2261 \u03c1\u0304\u03c0D3=6 (in R3), it is clear that as the diameter\n011038-6\nD at fixed mean density \u03c1\u0304 increases from zero, \u03b7 and the fraction of space occupied by the spheres will increase and clusters of various sizes will form and grow [1]. Once clusters have been identified, one can determine the pair-connectedness function P2\u00f0r; \u03b7\u00de, where P2\u00f0r; \u03b7\u00de \u00d7 4\u03c0r2dr is the conditional probability of finding a particle in a shell of radius dr at radial distance r from another particle in the same cluster (assuming statistical homogeneity and isotropy). Equivalently, this quantity gives the probability that there exists a path from the first to the second point that never leaves the particle phase, i.e., one that is always within a distance D=2 of at least one particle (cf. Fig. 1) [93]. This is the connected contribution to the full pair correlation function g2\u00f0r\u00de:\ng2\u00f0r\u00de\u2261 P2\u00f0r; \u03b7\u00de \u00fe B2\u00f0r; \u03b7\u00de; \u00f022\u00de where the pair-blocking function B2\u00f0r; \u03b7\u00de gives the correlation between pairs of particles which do not lie in the same cluster. For r < D\u00f0\u03b7\u00de, any pair of points must be within the same cluster; thus P2\u00f0r < D; \u03b7\u00de \u00bc g2\u00f0r\u00de. A related quantity is the direct-connectedness function C2\u00f0r; \u03b7\u00de (also known as the non-nodal correlation function) [88]. This is the probability that two points separated by a distance r are connected by a path through the set of random particles that does not involve nodes (i.e., one that cannot be broken by a single cut, as in Fig. 1). A general path between two points contains either zero or at least one node: this permits the Ornstein-Zernike (OZ) decomposition [88,89],\nP2\u00f0r12; \u03b7\u00de \u00bc C2\u00f0r12; \u03b7\u00de \u00fe \u03c1\u0304 Z dr3C2\u00f0r13; \u03b7\u00deP2\u00f0r32; \u03b7\u00de;\n\u00f023\u00de\nlabeling rij \u00bc ri \u2212 rj. The first quantity on the rhs contains paths with no nodes, thus it involves the first factor of C2, while for the second, we integrate over the position of the node closest to r1 (assuming a statistically homogeneous field \u03c1\u0304), noting that the path from r1 to r3 contains no nodes by definition, yielding another function of C2. Finally, the path from r3 to r2 can contain nodes, leading to the final factor of P2. In Fourier space this gives a simple relation between the pair-connectedness and direct-connectedness functions:\nC\u03032\u00f0k;\u03b7\u00de\u00bc P\u03032\u00f0k;\u03b7\u00de\n1\u00fe \u03c1\u0304P\u03032\u00f0k;\u03b7\u00de ; P\u03032\u00f0k;\u03b7\u00de\u00bc C\u03032\u00f0k;\u03b7\u00de 1\u2212 \u03c1\u0304C\u03032\u00f0k;\u03b7\u00de : \u00f024\u00de\nTo gain intuition for the pair-connectedness function (and related statistics), it is instructive to consider its form for a Poissonian system (noting that there is no Gaussian limit, given that we are dealing with discrete systems). At low densities, it can be computed as a perturbation series in \u03c1\u0304 (or, more strictly, in \u03b7=\u03b7c), first considering pairs of particles that are directly linked by the covered phase [i.e., their centers lie within D\u00f0\u03b7\u00de], then moving to pairs linked via a third particle and so on.

In this expansion, successive terms integrate over progressively more particle positions with, for example, the second term averaging over the position of r3, which must be within a distance of D from both r1 and r2. As such, this expression is difficult to compute beyond second order (which is convolutional) and thus rarely used in practice, unless \u03b7 \u226a \u03b7c and we restrict to small scales. In practice, approximate treatments\nare usually adopted, such as via the OZ equation (23) combined with heuristic \u201cclosure\u201d relations such as the Percus-Yevick form [94]. These give accurate predictions for P2\u00f0r; \u03b7\u00de in low-density regimes at relatively small r. This stands in contrast to the case familiar from cosmology, when the modeling of g2\u00f0r\u00de becomes progressively more accurate as r increases. For a general system, a similar decomposition to Eq.

At very low densities,P2\u00f0r\u00de tends to \u0398D\u00f0r\u00deg2\u00f0r\u00de, thus we do not expect this statistic to add information; however, as \u03b7 increases, the fraction of information contributed by the higher-order gn increases, until the system becomes nonperturbative at \u03b7 \u2248 \u03b7c (whence the notion of connectedness breaks down). One may ask whether an OZ-like equation with some closure relation can be used to provide an approximate analytic form for P2\u00f0r; \u03b7\u00de in the general case. Unfortunately, this is far from trivial, since any scheme only involving g2 will miss any contributions to P2 from g3 and above, which are of particular cosmological interest, especially when performing parameter inference in conjunction with g2 (as is the case below).

            "text": "Percolation describes the appearance of a phase transition in the system, which, in the above case, corresponds to the emergence of long-range connectivity in the point cloud due to arbitrarily large clusters of points, again defined by spheres of some diameter. This phenomenon is of relevance in a wide variety of physical settings such as the transport of fluid in porous systems, the appearance of fractures in geological formations, spread of diseases, and the collapse of gas into stars [1,2,90,92,95]. This crossover from nonpercolating clusters to the appearance of the incipient sample-spanning cluster (infinite in the thermodynamic limit) is characterized by a critical reduced density (also known as a percolation density), \u03b7c \u00bc \u03c1\u0304\u03c0Dc=6 (in R3), where Dc is the critical sphere diameter at fixed mean density \u03c1\u0304 with the system said to have percolated for \u03b7 > \u03b7c. For a Poissonian system in R3, numerical simulations find \u03b7c \u2248 0.34 [1], implying that the connected phase fills about 29% of the space. In addition to the connectedness functions described above, percolation theory utilizes a number of other statistical descriptors, which we outline below. The mean cluster size S\u00f0\u03b7\u00de gives a simple manner in which to characterize clustering and percolation at some\nreduced density \u03b7 [88]. This quantity is simply the mean number of particles in a cluster containing a randomly chosen particle. It is directly related to the pair-connectedness function by the following relation:\nS\u00f0\u03b7\u00de \u00bc 1\u00fe \u03c1\u0304 Z drP2\u00f0r; \u03b7\u00de \u00bc \u00bd1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0304C\u03032\u00f00; \u03b7\u00de \u22121; \u00f028\u00de\nwhere the second equality follows from Eq. (24). When \u03b7 > \u03b7c, clusters of infinite extent appear, thus S\u00f0\u03b7\u00de \u2192 \u221e, and the volume integral of the pair-connectedness function diverges. Given a form for C2\u00f0r; \u03b7\u00de, the second relation provides a useful manner in which to estimate \u03b7c, by solving \u03c1\u0304C\u03032\u00f00; \u03b7c\u00de \u00bc 1. Furthermore, the behavior close to the phase transition can be expressed in terms of critical exponents of the field: in particular, S\u00f0\u03b7\u00de \u223c \u00f0\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7c\u00de\u2212\u03b3 and C2\u00f0r; \u03b7\u00de \u223c r\u2212\u03b1 at large r, for \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b7\u2212c , where \u03b1 and \u03b3 are found to be universal for a broad class of physical models [92,96]. The mean cluster size can also be written in terms of socalled s-mer cluster statistics for densities below the percolation threshold \u03b7c [1,97]; namely,\nS\u00f0\u03b7\u00de \u00bc P\u221e s\u00bc1 s 2nsP\u221e\ns\u00bc1 sns ; \u03b7 < \u03b7c: \u00f029\u00de\nHere ns is the average number of s-mers, clusters containing s particles, per unit number of particles. This representation will be employed to estimate S\u00f0\u03b7\u00de from simulations. For a finite (aperiodic) system of size L, percolation may be studied by considering the existence of sample-spanning clusters, i.e., clusters of connected points which reach from the top to the bottom of the system (in some dimension). In the L \u2192 \u221e limit, these clusters will appear only for \u03b7 > \u03b7c: for finite systems, the behavior can be characterized using the percolation probability, \u03a0\u00f0\u03b7; L\u00de, which is the probability that a realization of size L will contain a samplespanning cluster. This will be used to compute the percolation threshold \u03b7c in Sec. V, via a finite-scaling analysis. If such a cluster exists, its mass [i.e., the number of constituent particles, denoted M\u00f0L; \u03b7\u00de] can be used to ascertain the effective mass fractal dimension dF of the field. In particular,\nM\u00f0L; \u03b7\u00de \u223c LdF ; \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b7\u2212c ; \u00f030\u00de\n011038-8\nwhere dF \u2248 2.42 for Poisson systems, and any other processes in the same universality class (cf.

            "text": "Although the statistics described in Sec. II have been principally applied to study the properties of physical materials, their applicability extends far beyond the terrestrial regime. In this work, we consider their application to spectroscopic galaxy surveys, such as those of the upcoming Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and Euclid projects [7,8]. Such projects will measure the angular positions and redshifts of O\u00f0107\u00de bright galaxies from ground- and space-based telescopes, providing a three-dimensional map of the Universe with unprecedented resolution. Fundamentally, galaxy surveys measure a set of N galaxy positions with some associated weights, representing experimental effects. In many typical analyses [100\u2013102], these are assigned to some coarse grid in R3, and the associated field taken to be an inhomogeneous Poisson sample of an underlying continuous field. This is itself modeled as a nonlinear transformation of the underlying dark matter distribution, whose correlation functions (particularly g2 and g3) encode early Universe physics, with the field obeying Gaussian statistics on sufficiently large scales, before a perturbative (and well-understood [103]) regime takes hold. Explicitly, the microscopic density \u03c1\u0302\u00f0x\u00de satisfies\n\u03c1\u0302\u00f0x\u00de \u223c Poisson\u00f0\u03c1\u0304\u00bd1\u00fe \u03b4g\u00f0x\u00de \u00de; \u03b4\u0303g\u00f0k\u00de \u223cN (0; h\u03032;g\u00f0k\u00de); \u00f031\u00de\non sufficiently large scales, where \u03b4g is a normally distributed continuous background field with variance h\u03032;g\u00f0k\u00de. On small, nonlinear, scales, a variety of galaxy formation processes become important and the above approach is known to be insufficient. This has led to a flurry of interest in additional statistics beyond the simple correlation functions. An alternative to the standard approach is to consider the point cloud traced by the galaxies as the fundamental object, facilitating direct application of the clustering techniques described in Sec. II. Rather than working with observational data directly, this work will make use of simulated data drawn from the publicly available QUIJOTE suite [104], which is a collection of 40 000 realizations of the Universe, each contained within a cubic volume of size L \u00bc 1000h\u22121 Mpc. (Following cosmologists convention, we work in h\u22121 Mpc units, where 1 Mpc\u2261 106 parsec and h\u22121 \u2248 1.4 is used to remove a leading scaling.) In particular, we use dark matter simulations that have been evolved down to redshift zero (today), and contain a set of \u223c105 dark matter halos: spheroidal agglomerations of matter in which galaxies are known to form. (In this work, we use only halos containing at least 64 dark matter particles to\navoid discreteness effects; these have masses M \u2273 5 \u00d7 1012h\u22121M\u2299 in our baseline simulations.) Rather than dealing with the complexities of assigning galaxies to dark matter halos as a function of their mass (for example, using a halo occupation distribution [105]), we use the positions of the dark matter halos as a direct proxy for the galaxy positions, which is sufficient for this initial study. As such, we do not require the Poisson-Gaussian assumptions of Eq. (31), and will utilize the galaxy catalog only as a discrete point cloud. In most scenarios, we will use the galaxy catalogs extracted from 1000 QUIJOTE high\u2013 resolution simulations, each run with the same underlying physical model, but with varying realizations of the (stochastic) initial conditions. A section of a typical simulation is shown in Fig. 2. We caution that these simulations do not fully represent observational data, in particular, due to their limited mass resolution and lack of (magneto)hydrodynamic effects. However, their simplified nature makes them ideal for the proof-of-concept study considered herein, since it allows for a large number of simulations (and thus determination of accurate covariances). Further work will necessarily require application of the above tools to higher-resolution simulations, though these are fewer in number."

As expected, the latter is simply unity everywhere, while the former shows considerable structure, and is quite different to that expected from most simple heterogeneous media [1]. On small scales (with r\u2272 0.2h\u22121 Mpc, considerably less than the average galaxy separation of \u22488h\u22121 Mpc), g2\u00f0r\u00de decays to zero; this is as expected, since the galaxies are of finite size and cannot overlap, enforcing some minimum separation. (Physically, galaxies can overlap; however, they would be classed as a single object in this paradigm.) The fact the mean galaxy (particle) separation is about an order of magnitude greater than the minimum pair separation is atypical behavior for most\n011038-9\ncondensed phase systems in which these two length scales are comparable to one another (see Refs. [1,3]). At large scales, g2\u00f0r\u00de decays to zero slightly slower than r\u22124 (in fact, r\u22123.96), implying that large-scale correlations are suppressed; since the decay is between r\u2212d and r\u2212\u00f0d\u00fe1\u00de for dimension d \u00bc 3, the system is said to have quasilong-range correlations. This has a physical origin: the large-scale behavior of g2\u00f0r\u00de arises from correlations in the Universe\u2019s quantum initial conditions, imprinted before cosmological inflation. Because of the dynamics of expansion (and slight breaking of time invariance in \u201cslow-roll\u201d inflation), these are suppressed on the largest scales. From the inset of Fig. 3(a), we note that g2\u00f0r\u00de has considerable structure on intermediate scales, with a prominent peak at r \u2248 100h\u22121 Mpc sourced by acoustic oscillations 14 billion years ago [107]. Clearly, the correlation properties of the galactic point cloud are very different to those for most media; this arises due to the combination of Poisson-like placements of galaxies and an underlying background stochastic field from the early Universe."

To place the magnitude of \u03c4 for the galaxies in the context of other models of correlated disordered media, we compute \u03c4 for the random sequential addition (RSA) process, which is a time-dependent (nonequilibrium) procedure that generates disordered sphere packings in Rd [111,112]. Starting with an empty but large volume in Rd, the RSA process is produced by randomly, irreversibly, and sequentially placing nonoverlapping spheres into the volume. If a new sphere does not overlap with any existing spheres, it will be added to the configuration; otherwise, the attempt is discarded. This procedure is repeated for ever-increasing volumes; then, an appropriate infinite-volume limit is obtained.

Notably, we find the number variance to increase faster than the Poisson case at smallR, roughly up to the scale corresponding to the second peak in r2h\u00f0r\u00de (arising from the imprint of acoustic oscillations from the early Universe), then fall to sub-Poisson values by scales corresponding to the peak inS\u00f0k\u00de. Avariance that increasesmuch faster than that for Poisson systems at small R is unusual for typical correlated disordered systems that have been investigated in condensed matter physics. Of course, that the large-scale variance approaches zero indicates that the system is hyperuniform; however, these scales are difficult to measure with most cosmological surveys.\nE. Void and particle nearest-neighbor functions\nIn Fig. 5, we depict the nearest-neighbor functions of the two sets of simulations, which provide an alternative description of the system\u2019s geometrical and topological properties, as discussed in Sec. II C (see also Ref. [77] for a previous discussion of the void function of galaxies, yielding similar results). These are obtained from the simulations by histogramming the minimum distance between each pair of particles (forHP) or a pair of particles and a Poisson random particle (for HV, determining if this particle lies within a void). For the Poisson system, we find identical results for the void and particle nearestneighbor density functions, as expected, but significant differences for the QUIJOTE simulations. While the cosmological case has a similar distribution of small\n011038-11\n(r\u2272 5h\u22121 Mpc) voids to that found in the Poisson realizations, it boasts significantly broader tail toward large r, and thus a somewhat larger mean void size. Specifically, the first moment of HV\u00f0R\u00de, l\u00f01\u00deV , defined by Eq. (20), is equal to 14h\u22121 Mpc (11h\u22121 Mpc) for the cosmological (Poisson) simulations. Interestingly, the maximal void size (averaged over realizations) for the QUIJOTE simulations is 42h\u22121 Mpc, which is almost 50% larger than that for the Poisson system with a maximal void size of 30h\u22121 Mpc. Furthermore, the variance of HV , defined as l \u00f02\u00de V \u2212 \u00f0l\u00f01\u00deV \u00de2, is much larger for the cosmological case: 2.7h\u22122 Mpc2 instead of 1.5h\u22122 Mpc2. In particular, the above results suggest that the galaxies will also boast a lower percolation threshold, foreshadowing what we describe below. For the particle distribution, we note that (a) the cosmological simulations have enhanced large-scale clustering, and thus a broad tail to the nearest-neighbor distance at large r, and (b) there is a sharp cut at low r, with no galaxies found within a separation of \u223c1h\u22121 Mpc. This is a consequence of \u201chalo exclusion\u201d; a pair of galaxies cannot be arbitrarily close, else they would be identified as a single object in the simulation code. Between these two effects, we find a reduced mean particle nearest-neighbor distribution in QUIJOTE, indicating that galaxies are more likely to be found in large-scale clusters. This matches theoretical\nexpectations. Specifically, the mean nearest-neighbor distance between particles l\u00f01\u00deP , defined by Eq. (21), is equal to 8h\u22121 Mpc (11h\u22121 Mpc) for the cosmological (Poisson) simulations, with a minimum distance of 1.1h\u22121 Mpc (0.29h\u22121 Mpc). In addition, the variance of the cosmological HP is again larger than the Poisson case, finding 2.5h\u22122 Mpc2 instead of 1.5h\u22122 Mpc2."

Given P2\u00f0r\u00de, this can be computed using Eq. (24), performing the Fourier transforms numerically via the FFTLog prescription [115]. Figure 7 shows C2\u00f0r; \u03b7\u00de for both the cosmological and Poisson simulations, alongside the analytic\nPercus-Yevick (PY) model, which solves the OZ equation by asserting that C2\u00f0r > D; \u03b7\u00de \u00bc 0 and P2\u00f0r < D; \u03b7\u00de \u00bc 1 [94]. [This is computed for point objects by using the correspondence with the known (cubic) form for hard spheres via CPY;Poiss2 \u00f0r; \u03b7\u00de \u00bc \u2212CPY;hard sphere2 \u00f0r;\u2212\u03b7\u00de [116].] For the Poisson case, we find good agreement between theory and simulations for small \u03b7 (far from the percolation threshold of \u03b7c \u2248 0.34), particularly away from the boundary at r \u00bc D\u00f0\u03b7\u00de. We observe very little power from the region with r > D\u00f0\u03b7\u00de, since most intracluster pathways with r > D\u00f0\u03b7\u00de contain at least one node, and thus do not contribute to C2\u00f0r\u00de. The cosmological simulations show a very different behavior, with two peaks observed, with one in similar location to the Poisson system and one at smaller r. This statistic represents the complexities of the clustering on smaller scales than that typically seen in P2 [with D\u00f0\u03b7\u00de \u223c 10h\u22121 Mpc], and the differences arise primarily due to small-scale physics, such as the restriction that galaxies cannot be arbitrarily close together. We also note that C\u00f0r; \u03b7\u00de was found to be ill-behaved for \u03b7\u2273 0.3 [due to P2\u00f0r; \u03b7\u00de not being square integrable], indicating that the cosmological simulations have percolated by around this value of \u03b7 (cf. Sec. V). In practice, we expect the percolation threshold to depend on the peculiarities of the galaxy sample in question: this will be discussed further below."

            "text": "We now turn to the issue of percolation, following the discussion in Sec. II E. As noted earlier, determining the mean cluster size S\u00f0\u03b7\u00de in a system as a function of \u03b7 is a\n011038-13\nuseful way in which to test whether a system has reached percolation. We utilize the representation of S\u00f0\u03b7\u00de in terms of s-mer cluster statistic ns, as defined by Eq. (29). In principle, we expect S\u00f0\u03b7\u00de \u2192 \u221e as \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b7c; in practice, S\u00f0\u03b7\u00de \u2264 N, where N is the total number of particles in the box. To account for this, it is useful to analyze a number of different configurations with different box sizes L (and therebyN \u2261 \u03c1\u0304L3). Here, we construct (aperiodic) subboxes from the QUIJOTE simulations, with L in the range \u00bd400; 800 h\u22121 Mpc (noting that the majority of our analyses are restricted to r < 200h\u22121 Mpc), and construct\nanalogous Poisson realizations for each. To examine percolation at each choice of box size, we generate clusters for various values of \u03b7 by varying the sphere radius D\u00f0\u03b7\u00de and utilizing burning (friends-of-friends) algorithms, as described above. Figure 8 shows the mean cluster size for the two datasets as a function of L and \u03b7. In both cases, we observe that S\u00f0\u03b7; L\u00de begins to approach its asymptotic limit as \u03b7 increases, and, moreover, the limit is approached faster as the box size increases. Extrapolating the Poissonian results to large L, the percolation threshold [whence\n011038-14\nS\u00f0\u03b7; L\u00de \u2248 N] appears to be around \u03b7c \u00bc 0.35, matching previous studies [97]. For the cosmological simulations, we find a generally slower approach to \u03b7c (corresponding to a different critical exponent), and additionally a lower percolation threshold, around \u03b7c \u00bc 0.28 for L \u2192 \u221e. As above, this arises since the galaxy sample contains a stochastic background inhomogeneity, leading to various areas being super- or sub-Poisson populated in a correlated manner. Even at low \u03b7: for \u03b7 \u00bc 0.1, clusters in the full-volume cosmological simulation contain an average of \u224815 particles, while those in the Poisson realizations contain \u22482 only. It is further instructive to consider the size distribution of clusters, via the average number of s-mers ns, as defined in Eq. (29). This is shown in Fig. 9 for a suite of cosmological and Poissonian boxes at L \u00bc 800with a variety of values of the reduced density \u03b7. At low \u03b7, we find that the ratio of cosmological and Poissonian simulations is a strongly increasing function of s, with the largest slopes seen for small reduced densities. In this limit, the system is far from percolation; thus large clusters are rare in both systems. The enhanced correlations in the galaxy distribution seen in the cosmological case increase the probability of an s-mer forming (at fixed s), giving this stark difference in behavior. As \u03b7 approaches the percolation threshold, the ns ratio becomes roughly constant with s; this indicates that the additional galaxy correlations impact only the largest s-mers, as we are dominated by the clustering signal imprinted by the circumscribed spheres, rather than any intrinsic effects. To measure the percolation threshold of the cosmological simulations in a robust fashion, we perform a finitescaling analysis, following the approach of Ref. [117],\noriginally formulated in Ref. [118]. In essence, this computes the percolation probability [\u03a0\u00f0\u03b7; L\u00de, defined as the fraction of realizations containing a cluster for which the circumscribed spheres overlap with both the top and bottom of the box] for the simulations at various values of L and \u03b7 and extrapolates using asymptotic scaling relations to find the L \u2192 \u221e limit. Figure 10 shows the obtained percolation probability distribution for both sets of simulations as a function of the volume filling fraction \u03d5. This is computed numerically for each simulation from the probability that a randomly chosen point within the box is within a distance D=2 from the nearest particle, i.e., whether it is within the sphere phase; for the Poisson case, this is asymptotically equal to 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b7. The behavior seen in Fig. 10 is qualitatively similar for the Poisson and cosmological system: the percolation probability is small for low \u03d5 (whence the typical extent of the cluster is far below L), and asymptotes to unity at large \u03d5. As the box size increases, the transition becomes sharper, and asymptotes to a Heaviside function in the L \u2192 \u221e limit. It is also clear that the cosmological simulations percolate at smaller values of \u03b7 than the Poisson realizations; this is as expected, and indicates their enhanced clustering due to background inhomogeneities. To extract the percolation thresholds from \u03a0\u00f0\u03d5; L\u00de, we fit the data to the phenomenological sigmoid model of Ref. [117], as shown in Fig. 10:\n\u03a0\u00f0\u03d5; L\u00de \u2248 1 2 1\u00fe tanh\n\u03d5 \u2212 \u03d5c\u00f0L\u00de\n\u0394\u00f0L\u00de\n; \u00f034\u00de\nwhere \u03d5c\u00f0L\u00de and \u0394\u00f0L\u00de are the percolation volume fraction and width at box size L and \u03d5 is the volume filling fraction obtained as described above. Asymptotically,\u0394\u00f0L\u00de \u223c L\u22121=\u03bd and \u03d5c\u00f0L\u00de \u2212 \u03d5c \u223c L\u22121=\u03bd for critical exponent [1]; by fitting for \u03bd from the obtained values of \u0394\u00f0L\u00de, we can thus obtain \u03d5c \u2261 limL\u2192\u221e \u03d5c\u00f0L\u00de. Here, we find a critical exponent of \u03bd \u00bc 0.85 0.03 (0.88 0.03) for the QUIJOTE (Poisson) simulations, with a corresponding percolation threshold of \u03d5c \u00bc 0.223 (0.290) or \u03b7c \u00bc 0.252 (0.343), each with a statistical error around 0.001. The Poissonian case matches standard results [1], and, as foreshadowed in Figs. 6 and 8, the cosmological system percolates at lower densities, due to the additional clustering signature imprinted by early Universe and galaxy formation physics. In addition, the fact that the two sets of simulations appear to share the same critical exponent \u03bd suggests that they belong to the same universality class, as do other correlated disordered systems [119]. It is important to note that the percolation thresholds found herein are not a universal property of galaxy distributions; rather, they depend on the galaxy sample in question. To explore this, we have repeated the analysis using a galaxy sample with half the density of the fiducial sample, and another including dark matter halos (i.e.,\n011038-15\ngalaxies) down to half of the aforementioned minimum size. For the former case (with \u03c1\u0304 \u223c 0.5 \u00d7 10\u22124h3 Mpc\u22123, we find that the percolation threshold for the cosmological sample increases to \u03b7c \u00bc 0.285, while it remains the same for the density-matched Poissonian sample (as expected). This can be rationalized by noting that the galaxies roughly follow Poisson statistics above a stochastic background, caused by the matter density; if \u03c1\u0304 is reduced, the Poisson part of the stochasticity becomes more dominant, thus \u03b7c tends toward its Poisson limit. In the second scenario, we find \u03b7c \u00bc 0.207, significantly lower than the fiducial analysis. In this case, we have both a sample of almost twice greater density and one that is more biased with respect to the continuous dark matter density (such that \u03c1\u0302galaxy=\u03c1\u0302dark matter is larger, smoothed on sufficiently large scales). In both cases, however, we find a similar critical exponent (0.82 0.03) to the above. Finally, we consider the effective fractal dimension of the system dF. As discussed in Sec. II, this may be computed from the dependence of the sample-spanning cluster mass M\u00f0\u03b7; L\u00de (i.e., its number of constituent particles) on the simulation box size L at the percolation threshold \u03b7c [Eq. (30)]. To explore this, we repeat the above analysis for the fiducial sample, computing the mass of the sample-spanning cluster (when it exists) for five box sizes in the range \u00bd700; 800 h\u22121 Mpc and five reduced densities in the range \u03b7c 0.1. For the Poisson system, fitting for the relationship M\u00f0\u03b7; L\u00de \u223c Ld and\ninterpolating to \u03b7c gives dF \u2261 d\u00f0\u03b7c\u00de \u2248 2.40 0.07, matching that predicted from theory [1]. For the galaxy sample, we find dF \u00bc 2.36 0.08, which is consistent with the Poisson realizations, even though the percolation threshold differs. This is an important result: the cosmological sample lies in the same universality class as simple Poisson realizations, for the range of scales considered: r \u223c 500\u20131000h\u22121 Mpc. This is broadly consistent with previous results on smaller scales; Refs. [98,99,120] describe a variety of methods to ascertain the effective fractal index, with galaxy counts yielding dF \u00bc 2.2 0.2 on \u227210h\u22121 Mpc scales, and correlation functions finding the same on \u2272100h\u22121 Mpc scales."

            "text": "A crucial problem in modern-day cosmology is the extraction of physical parameters from observed statistics, such as the distribution of galaxies. In the standard paradigm (dubbed \u03bd\u039bCDM), six parameters are of relevance: (1) the Universe\u2019s current expansion rate H0, (2) the density of baryonic matter \u03c9b, (3) the combined density of dark matter and baryonic matter \u03a9m, (4) the amplitude of clustering in the Universe \u03c38, (5) the slope of the primordial power spectrum (i.e., structure factor) ns, and (6) the sum of the neutrino masses P m\u03bd. While ns and\n011038-16\n\u03a9b are well constrained by observations of the cosmic microwave background [121], the remaining parameters are a key target for upcoming galaxy surveys. Traditionally, they are constrained through summary statistics such as the two-particle and three-particle correlation functions. Such an analysis proceeds by the fitting measured statistics to analytic models depending on the above physical parameters [102]. In this section, we consider the utility of alternative statistics (described above) in this effort. Three metrics by which we judge a statistic to be useful are (a) ease of computation, (b) dimensionality, and (c) information content. Here, we will principally concentrate on the pairconnectedness function P2\u00f0r\u00de, since this has not previously been used in cosmology, unlike void probability or nearestneighbor functions [80]. As shown above, the statistic is simple and fast to measure from the data and has a lowdimensional form, satisfying two of the above criteria. We now proceed to quantify its ability to constrain cosmological parameters. An alternative approach to the above prescription is to model the entire galaxy distribution directly (without compressing to statistics such as the correlation functions), with either perturbative methods [122\u2013125] or machine learning approaches [126\u2013131]. In principle, this approach enables one to obtain optimal constraints on all parameters of interest, though it is nontrivial to implement in practice, due to the huge dimensionality of the galaxy distribution and the necessity to run a large number of expensive simulations."

If the noise properties of the statistics are known (for example, if we assert that the distribution of g2 is a multivariate Gaussian), this comparison can be used to place constraints on the underlying parameters via Bayes theorem. A useful estimate of the constraining power of some statistic X (e.g., g2) can be obtained using a Fisher matrix [132], defined as\nFX\u03b1\u03b2 \u00bc dX d\u03b8\u03b1 T C\u22121X dX d\u03b8\u03b2 ; \u00f035\u00de\nwhere f\u03b8\u03b1g are the set of cosmological parameters of interest, and C is the covariance matrix of X (treated as a vector), i.e., CX \u00bc E\u00bdXXT , averaging over realizations of the underlying microscopic density at fixed \u03b8. According to the Crame\u0301r-Rao theorem, \u00f0F\u22121;X\u00de\u03b1\u03b1 gives the best possible constraint on \u03b8\u03b1 from a measurement X, i.e., var\u00f0\u03b8\u03b1\u00de \u2265 \u00f0F\u22121;X\u00de\u03b1\u03b1. [This limit is saturated if X obeys Gaussian statistics, i.e., X\u0302 \u223cN (X\u00f0\u03b8\u00de;C).] To assess the utility of statistics such as P2 and g2, we need simply\ncompute the covariance matrix and the parameter derivatives appearing in Eq. (35), both of which can be done using a set of simulations. Explicitly, given a set of n realizations X\u0302\u00f0i\u00de with varying initial conditions, the two can be computed via\nC\u0302X \u00bc 1\nn \u2212 1 Xn i\u00bc1 \u00f0X\u0302\u00f0i\u00de \u2212 X\u0304\u00de\u00f0X\u0302\u00f0i\u00de \u2212 X\u0304\u00deT;\nddX d\u03b8\u03b1 \u00bc 1 n Xn i\u00bc1 X\u0302\u00f0i\u00de\u00f0\u03b8\u03b1 \u00fe \u03b4\u03b8\u03b1\u00de \u2212 X\u0302\u00f0i\u00de\u00f0\u03b8\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4\u03b8\u03b1\u00de 2\u03b4\u03b8\u03b1 ; \u00f036\u00de\nusing finite difference for the parameter derivatives, and denoting X\u0304 \u00bc \u00f01=n\u00dePni\u00bc1 X\u0302\u00f0i\u00de [104]. While the Fisher forecast is appealing in its simplicity, it is not without limitations. Firstly, it gives accurate bounds on cosmological properties only if the statistics are Gaussian distributed, which can break down in the case of large correlations between bins, and the parameter posterior is Gaussian, which fails for non-negative parameters, for example. Secondly, a large number of simulations may be required to compute the quantities in Eq. (36), and, if too few are used, the constraining power of a given statistic will be overestimated. (This occurs since noise in the parameter derivatives add a positive definite contribution to the Fisher matrix, and thus reduce the size of the inverted matrix, i.e., the output parameter variances.) An alternative approach is to use simulationbased inference (also known as likelihood-free analysis) [133\u2013135]. In essence, this draws a set of cosmological parameters \u03b8 from some input prior, computes a realization X\u0302\u00f0\u03b8\u00de for each, and compares a \u201ctrue\u201d dataset to the empirical distribution from the simulations. This does not make assumptions on the statistics\u2019 noise properties, and, in the case of too few simulations, will only underestimate the cosmological utility. Here, we examine the constraining power of various summary statistics using both the Fisher matrix formalism (which has become commonplace in cosmology) and simulation-based inference (which is far less common, though more accurate). In particular, we consider the cosmological parameters H0, \u03a9m, \u03c38, and P m\u03bd and the following descriptors: g2, g3, P2, and HV , all of which can be defined for discrete point clouds, such as the galaxy density used in this work. For the pair-connectedness function, we fix the reduced density to \u03b7\u2261 \u03c1\u0304\u03c0D3=6 \u00bc 0.2, which is a useful balance between the uninformative case (\u03b7 \u00bc 0) and the percolated limit discussed in Sec. V, though we note that other choices may yield somewhat different results. Additional statistics could be straightforwardly added, though we caution that descriptors such as the number variance are fully described by g2, and will thus not add additional information. Using the FASTPM code [136], we run n \u00bc 512 QUIJOTE-like dark matter simulations with the following fiducial parameters:\n011038-17\nfH0\u00bc68kms\u22121Mpc\u22121;\u03a9m\u00bc0.31;\u03c9b\u00bc0.0227;ns\u00bc0.96; \u03c38\u00bc0.8178; P m\u03bd\u00bc0 eVg, and compute the four statistics for each realization. In all cases, we consider only scales above 20h\u22121 Mpc (where the simulations are accurate, given the mean pairwise separation of \u22488h\u22121 Mpc), and choose the radial bin sizes to keep the dimensionality fixed to O\u00f0100\u00de elements. g2, P2, and HV are computed as before, with g3 computed using the approach of Ref. [137], involving a decomposition into a Legendre multipole basis, with components g3;l\u00f0r1; r2\u00de for l \u2208 f0; 1; 2; 3g. In accordance with Sec. III, we compute this statistic in configuration space (rather than as a Fourier-space bispectrum), which obviates the need to grid the particles. These simulations are used to compute the covariance matrixC of the statistics using Eq. (36) (initial testing demonstrated that this is a sufficient number of simulations to estimate C and its inverse robustly, after including the correction factor of Ref. [138]), the structure of which is visualized in Fig. 11. We find significant correlations both within and between a number of statistics. In particular, the individual bins of g3 and P2 are highly correlated, indicating that their noise properties may not be Gaussian. In contrast, the void\nnearest-neighbor function has an almost diagonal correlation matrix, and is seen to be largely independent from other statistics. This suggests that it can add significant information compared to analyses using g2 alone. The other ingredient required for Fisher forecasting is the set of parameter derivatives. These are computed using Eq. (36), with n \u00bc 512 simulations (again computed using FASTPM, with a total cost of \u223c104 CPU hours), utilizing finite difference in each of the eight sets of parameters. For the neutrino mass, we have the bound P m\u03bd > 0, thus we instead utilize one-sided derivatives, following Ref. [104], and use the method of Ref. [139] to emulate the effects of massive neutrinos by modifying the initial conditions. Following this, we compute the Fisher matrix via Eq. (35) for various combinations of statistics. We caution that this result appears to retain some dependence on n due to residual noise in the parameter derivatives. This will lead to the constraints being artificially tightened somewhat; however, it is computationally impractical to increase n by a significant amount. For the simulation-based inference (SBI), we utilize a set of 8192 galaxy simulations computed using FASTPM with the method of Ref. [139] at random locations in parameter space, according to the flat priors: H0 \u2208 \u00bd0;100 kms\u22121Mpc\u22121,\u03a9m\u2208\u00bd0;0.3 , \u03c38 \u2208 \u00bd0.4;1.2 , P m\u03bd \u2208 \u00bd0; 4 eV. (The neutrino mass limit is significantly weaker than the bound from the latest probes [121], but is appropriate given the small volume of the simulations.) Summary statistics for each are computed as before, and fed into the SBI code, which uses neural networks (via the sequential neural posterior estimation method) to compute the parameter posterior, given a true observation, taken from the mean of the fiducial simulations discussed above."

            "text": "Figure 12 shows the constraints on cosmological parameters from analyses using the pair correlation function and pair-connectedness function, both via the Fisher and SBI forecasts. From the Fisher forecast, we observe that P2 is a poor predictor of the expansion rate and matter density, but gives much tighter constraints on the clustering amplitude and neutrino mass than g2. This is unsurprising: the slope of P2\u00f0r\u00de is strongly sensitive to the galaxy clustering properties (set by \u03c38, and, on small scales, P m\u03bd), but (being a monotonic function) contains little information on other properties such as early Universe physics. The SBI forecasts give qualitatively similar results, with the P2 constraints onH0 and\u03a9m being largely dominated by the prior, with the combined g2 \u00fe P2 constraints reproducing those of g2 alone, For \u03c38, P2 is again shown to be of considerable use, with a significant (factor of a \u22482.6\u00d7, equivalently to observing a 7 times greater volume of space) tightening in the one-dimensional posterior found by adding P2, driven by the differing degeneracy directions in the \u03c38 \u2212H0 and \u03c38 \u2212\u03a9m planes.

Notably, the individual bins of g3;0 and P2 are highly correlated, and there are a number of nontrivial correlations between observables, though few with HV .\n011038-18\nforecast suggests that the pair-connectedness function does not give significant additional information on the neutrino mass; however, it is shown to change the \u03c38 \u2212 P m\u03bd degeneracy direction considerably. The disagreement between Fisher and SBI forecasts both quantitatively (in terms of the reduction in width of the \u03c38 posterior) and qualitatively (whether the P m\u03bd posterior is affected) may appear a little unsettling. We attribute this to a number of reasons: (1) as mentioned above, the Fisher forecast will give artificially narrow constraints if insufficient simulations have been run, (2) the Fisher forecast is inaccurate for parameters whose posterior is non-Gaussian (such as the neutrino mass, due to the P m\u03bd > 0 constraint), and (3) the SBI forecasts can be artificially broadened by insufficient simulations being run. However, the results of Fig. 12 are enough to convince us that P2 contains significant information regarding the clustering amplitude \u03c38, and its inclusion greatly aids cosmological analyses, including via degeneracy breaking with P m\u03bd. Although we present results only for reduced density \u03b7 \u00bc 0.2 here, a similar story holds also for \u03b7 \u00bc 0.1; in this case, the improvements in cosmological parameters are somewhat weaker, due to the higher-order correlator contributions to P2\u00f0r; \u03b7\u00de being suppressed [Eq. (27)]. We expect that combining\nmeasurements of the pair-connectedness function with multiple values of \u03b7 could further increase the constraining power, again at little computational cost. It is interesting to compare the cosmological utility of the pair-connectedness function to that of other higher-order statistics. Before doing so, let us briefly outline our predictions. In this test, we are limited to relatively large scales (r\u2273 20h\u22121 Mpc, due to simulation resolution effects), where the galaxy distribution (if treated as a continuous field) is close to Gaussian. As such, we expect the majority of the information content on cosmological parameters to be encapsulated by the two- and three-point functions, g2 and g3, with only a small amount leaking into higher-order statistics. In this case, the combination of g2 with alternative statistics will likely perform worse than that of g2 and g3; our question is whether there are statistics that are able to recoup most of the information present in g3 in a simpler form (for example, in the unidimensional HV and P2 statistics). If such a statistic exists, it is likely that it also contains significant information on small scales (as probed by future surveys such as that of the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph and the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey [140,141]), where the perturbative hierarchy described above breaks down. Indeed, statistical physics provides examples of small-scale systems where g2 \u00fe P2\n011038-19\noutperforms g2 \u00fe g3 [91]; it will be interesting to study such effects further in the future. In Fig. 13 we show the Fisher and SBI constraints on the same parameter set as above for g2 in combination with g3, P2, and HV [142]. From both the Fisher and SBI forecasts, we find that no additional statistics lead to significant improvements in the expansion rate constraints, except for a slight tightening from g3. This is not surprising: H0 is primarily measured from an oscillatory feature in g2 arising from acoustic waves in the early Universe, which is generally absent in other statistics. In the SBI forecast, the same is true for the matter density, \u03a9m, and the neutrino mass, though the Fisher forecasts disagree on this aspect, as above, and should therefore caution is warranted (especially given the larger dimensionality of g3). For the clustering amplitude \u03c38, we find similar improvement when combining g2 with any other statistic, with a slight preference for g3 in the SBI analysis (or a significant one for the Fisher forecast). This matches the above predictions. Our conclusion from this exercise is the following: if one wishes to constrain the Universe\u2019s clustering amplitude (a key target of modern-day cosmology), the addition of P2 or HV into cosmological analyses provides an excellent route (cf. Ref. [77]), and contains similar information to g3. Importantly, the alternative statistics are of much lower dimension than g3 and P2 is much less computationally expensive to measure (requiring \u223c5 CPU minutes per simulation, instead of \u223c1 CPU hour for g3 or Hv). If one performs the analysis using a combination of pairconnectedness functions with different values of \u03b7, the\nresults may be stronger still. While this analysis is necessarily simplistic and limited to comparatively large scales (due to the nature of the simulation suite), it nevertheless suggests that the pair-connectedness function is a new statistic of significant potential, and could carry important information also on small scales. In contrast to correlators such as g2 and g3 [145], this is difficult to model analytically even at large r, due to its inherent dependence on short-scale physics including the connection between galaxies and dark matter. For this reason it will likely prove useful to adopt a simulation-based methodology to analyze P2, such as the SBI techniques discussed above, and marginalize over parameters controlling galaxy formation. On small scales, a similar approach is required for any statistic, due to the breakdown of perturbative modeling."

            "heading": "VII. SUMMARY",
            "text": "In this work, we have considered the application of the theory of disordered heterogeneous media and statistical mechanics to cosmology, and of cosmology to the former. By treating the distribution of galaxies in the present-day Universe as a point process, we can analyze the data using techniques developed to characterize heterogeneous media, such as the correlation functions and nearest-neighbor distributions. Furthermore, by augmenting the dataset with some concept of \u201cconnectedness\u201d (here defined by circumscribing the galaxies with spheres), we may utilize various clustering diagnostics and pair-connectedness functions, which encode a different subset of the information present\n011038-20\nwithin the distribution and additionally allows the percolation properties to be determined. Such a framework (a) provides a novel method for understanding the galaxy distribution, whose importance will only grow in the next decade with the plurality of upcoming telescopes, and (b) demonstrates the applicability of heterogeneous media and statistical mechanical techniques in a very different regime to that usually explored. Our main conclusions are the following. (i) The galaxy distribution exhibits very different\nphysical properties to those of conventional materials, leading to distinct signatures in a wide variety of clustering and correlation descriptors. On the largest scales, the system approaches hyperuniformity, while on the smallest, it becomes almost antihyperuniform and strongly inhomogeneous; this dichotomy arises from the fact that the minimum separation between galaxies is much smaller than the mean interparticle distance, with localized groups of galaxies separated by vast cosmic distance. (ii) Physically, the cosmological system has two peculiarities: (a) although we treat the galaxies as point objects, they have some physical scale in practice, and cannot overlap, and (b) the distribution carries the signatures of a large-scale stochastic background that modulates the quasi-Poissonian distribution; this is sourced by early Universe physics and gravitational evolution,\n(iii) The galaxy pair correlation function shows this behavior clearly, with the expected hyperuniform tail appearing only at gargantuan scales (r\u2273 200h\u22121 Mpc), and with a sharp peak at the mean pairwise particle separation of r \u2248 8h\u22121 Mpc. This scale separation induces a large number variance, which is unusually super-Poissonian on small scales, yet sub-Poissonian on the largest. These results are consistent with the order metric \u03c4, which we determine for the galaxy sample for the first time: its value (\u03c4 \u00bc 4.85) implies that the system is strongly correlated and disordered. The nearest-neighbor functions are again consistent with this picture, with considerably extended tails, a lack of particle pairs below some critical galaxy size, and much enhanced variance relative to the Poissonian case (and most other common scenarios). (iv) Analyses of pair-connectedness functions, mean particle numbers, and sample-spanning clusters indicate that the galaxy sample percolates at significantly lower reduced densities than corresponding Poisson realizations. For the fiducial galaxy simulations, finite-scaling analysis gives \u03b7c \u00bc 0.25 in the former case compared to \u03b7c \u00bc 0.34 in the latter, a difference which is amplified by increasing the sample density. This is again supported by the above\nevidence: the scale separation is a consequence of the extra small-scale clustering in the galaxy distribution which leads to faster percolation. Both scenarios appear to have the same critical exponents and fractal dimensions, implying that they live in the same universality class, despite very different physics operating. (v) The pair-connectedness function is a conceptually straightforward and easy-to-measure statistic that carries useful and accessible large-scale information about the underlying physical parameters of the Universe, and can be trivially extended to small scales. This could enhance the cosmological utility of future galaxy surveys, in combination with conventional techniques. Using simulation-based analysis techniques, we forecast that constraints on amplitude of clustering improve by a factor of \u22485 (or \u224825 in terms of survey volume) when performing inference using the large-scale pair-connectedness and pair correlation functions as opposed to the pair correlation function alone (which is standard in cosmology). This provides a useful alternative to the three-particle correlation function g3, which is of significantly lower dimension and much faster to model, and is shown to be a resummation of correlation functions of all order. Unlike the largescale three-particle function, it seems unlikely that P2\u00f0r\u00de can be modeled analytically; simulation-based treatments will likely be required in this case.\nThe galaxy samples used in this work are purposefully simplified, in order to provide a proof-of-concept study capturing the essential physical attributes of the cosmological setup. More work is needed before the statistics can be applied to real data, and will require the following: (a) higher resolution simulations containing more particles, allowing smaller scales to be probed, (b) inclusion of real galaxies in the simulations, rather than dark matter halos, and the associated physical uncertainties with their formation [146,147], (c) anisotropic distortions in the Universe created by transforming from redshifts to physical coordinates [148], and (d) inhomogeneities in the field induced by observational effects, such as the limited field of view of the telescope. However, all of these complexities have been overcome a number of times before for other statistics (such as the correlation functions [102]) and we expect can be similarly surmounted in this case. Furthermore, it is important to characterize how the statistics depend on the galaxy sample: for the correlation functions, this is well understood (and encapsulated by \u201cbias parameters,\u201d which depend on galaxy mass and luminosity), but should be explored further for nearestneighbor and pair-connectedness functions, as well as the percolation threshold. Finally, we consider the broader extensions of this work. Although we have restricted our gaze to galaxy\n011038-21\ndistributions, this is far from being the only stochastic distribution in the Universe. One additional application could include a more principled treatment of cosmic voids [10,11]: these are low-density regions in the galaxy distribution that form a partition of the space, and could be described by the same mathematics as that invoked for percolation. Even more relevant is the distribution of \u201cbubbles\u201d of ionized gas around the first galaxies [149,150]. The growth of such bubbles likely led to the Universe\u2019s reionization approximately one billion years after the big bang, the time of which is set by percolation itself. Finally, we note that there are a wealth of techniques from the theory of disordered heterogeneous media that have not been considered in this work. It would be interesting to consider the utility of the various descriptors in the context of \u201csimulated annealing\u201d [91,151], to understand the extent to which any statistic can capture the full complexities of the field, though we caution that conventional approaches will likely need to be modified to account for the peculiarities of the galaxy distribution, in particular its significant scale separation. Further still, we may consider how annealing techniques allow us to recover \u201ceffective pair interactions\u201d between individual galaxies [152], and thus learn more about the Universe\u2019s average dynamics."

[34] Because of the conversion of cosmological redshifts into distances, the observed galaxy density is not isotropic and but distorted along the line of sight to the galaxy survey n\u0302. As such, the pair correlation function depends on an additional angle, i.e., g2\u00f0r\u00de \u2192 g2\u00f0r; r\u0302 \u00b7 n\u0302\u00de.

[142] We recall that our HV void statistic follows a somewhat different definition to the void size function often used in cosmology, and is restricted to comparatively large scales\n(r > 20h\u22121 Mpc, as for the other statistics), with only spherical voids. This differs from the approach used in several cosmological studies [11,143,144] and explains the reduced utility found herein, and the different correlation properties seen in Fig. 11.\n[143] C. D.
