    "abstractText": "Reticulate pigmentary disorders (RPDs) are a group of inherited and acquired skin conditions characterized by hyperpigmented and/or hypopigmented macules. Inherited RPDs include dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH), dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria (DUH), reticulate acropigmentation of Kitamura (RAK), Dowling-Degos disease (DDD), dyskeratosis congenita (DKC), Naegeli\u2013Franceschetti\u2013Jadassohn syndrome (NFJS), dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis (DPR), and X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder. Although reticulate pattern of pigmentation is a common characteristic of this spectrum of disorders, the distribution of pigmentation varies among these disorders, and there may be clinical manifestations beyond pigmentation. DSH, DUH, and RAK are mostly reported in East Asian ethnicities. DDD is more common in Caucasians, although it is also reported in Asian countries. Other RPDs show no racial predilection. This article reviews the clinical, histological, and genetic variations of inherited RPDs.",

Inherited reticulate pigmentary disorders are caused by various genetic mutations and have distinct clinical manifestations, such as age of onset and distribution of the pigmentation.

DSH was first reported by Toyama in 1929 [3]. DSH is characterized by a mixture of hyperpigmented and hypopigmented macules on the dorsal aspects of the distal extremities [4\u20139]. In addition, DSH is characterized by pigmented freckle-like lesions on the face. The onset of DSH occurs most frequently in infancy or early childhood, and it may extend slowly over time, affecting the face, the sides of the neck, and the supraclavicular region [10]. Skin lesions often stop spreading before adolescence and last for life. DSH has been reported mainly in Japan, China, and Taiwan [9,11,12]. Skin biopsies for DSH demonstrate a reduced density of melanocytes in the hypopigmented macules, and the melanocytes show degenerative vacuolation, indicative of apoptosis [10]. In contrast, an increase in the melanin content of the basal layer of the epidermis is observed in the hyperpigmented macules [13]. By using split-dopa skin preparation for DSH, we demonstrated that there was a reduced density of melanocytes in the hypopigmented macules [4]. Electron-microscopic study revealed that melanocytes in the hypopigmented lesions exhibit degenerative mitochondria and cytoplasmic vacuolization [4,14]."

Although many cases reported are familial so far, still some sporadic cases have been reported [8]. A heterozygous mutation of the ADAR1 gene was identified to be involved in DSH [15,16]. ADAR1 maps to chromosome 1q21.1-21.2 [17\u201319]. ADAR1 is an RNAediting enzyme that catalyzes the deamination of adenosine to inosine in double-strained RNA substrates during post-transcription processing [20]. Patients with DSH usually have no complications. However, recent studies showed that patients with a frameshift mutation (p.Glu673ValfsX652) in ADAR1 presented with congenital heart disease [21] and hemangioma disease [22]. In addition, some reports showed that a mutation of p.G1007R in the ADAR1 gene caused some neurological symptoms, such as dystonia, mental deterioration [8], and brain calcification [14]. However, in other cases with the mutation of p.G1007R in the ADAR1 gene, no neurological abnormality was found [23]. The mechanism by which the mutations in ADAR1 induce DSH remains to be elucidated."

RAK manifests as a well-defined reticulate, with slightly depressed, brownish macules affecting the dorsal aspect of hands\nand feet in the first or second decade of life. The macules gradually darken and enlarge with increasing age until middle age [36,37]. The typical mature-skin manifestation of RAK reveals an angular reticulate, with freckle-like hyperpigmented macules distributed on the dorsal aspect of the extremities. The macules are usually slightly depressed. About 50% of Japanese RAK patients demonstrate punctate pits on the palms and soles. Dermoscopic observation of the hyperpigmented lesions revealed a dark brown background with overlying black dots [38]. Histopathologically, RAK lesion is characterized by epidermal atrophy, with elongation and thinning of rete ridge with a slightly increased number of melanocytes and hypermelanosis [16,37]."

ADAM10 encodes a zinc metalloprotease, which is a member of a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) family. The types of mutations in the ADAM10 gene include the nonsense, missense, and splice-site mutations [16]. The ADAM10 protein is involved in a variety of biological processes, including regulation of the distribution patterns and transport processes of melanosomes in keratinocytes [39]. Additionally, ADAM10 is known to be involved in the ectodomain shedding of Notch proteins as substrates in the skin [35]. In a hairless mice model, an increase in skin pigmentation was noticed during aging, which was associated with the ADAM10 mutation. These results provide an explanation for the inhibitory effect of the ADAM10 protein on melanocyte expansion [40,41]."

Follicular DDD, a distinct type of DDD, presents uniquely with characteristics such as hyperkeratotic follicular papules resembling comedones; acne-like scars with a pitted appearance around the mouth; and perianal reticulated pigmented lesions, which can be observed during adulthood [43]. Galli\u2013Galli disease (GGD) is regarded as an acantholytic variant of Dowling-Degos [44]. It is characterized by the diagnostic features of DDD, with additional acantholysis in suprabasal [45], antler with melanin at the tips, while there is no increase in the number of melanocytes. Additionally, some reports showed that DDD may manifest in a generalized form [46]. However, the genetic basis of this kind of DDD still needs more investigation to elucidate."

DDD can be classified into four subtypes. DDD1 (OMIM#179850) is caused by mutations in the KRT5 gene on chromosome 12q13 [49]. DDD2 (OMIM#615327) is caused by mutations in the POFUT1 gene on chromosome 20q11 [50]. DDD3 (OMIM#615674) is caused by mutations mapped to chromosome 17p13.3 [51]. DDD4 (OMIM#615696) is caused by mutations in the POGLUT1 gene on chromosome 3q13 [52]. GGD can be found with mutations in the KRT5 gene. GGD can also be due to POGLUT1 mutations, and most of these cases are of European ancestry, although a Japanese patient with GGD due to a mutation in POGLUT1 has also been reported [42]. Mutations in genes affecting melanosome trafficking and the Notch receptor signaling pathway, which is an essential regulator of melanocyte and keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation [53], have been implicated in the pathogenesis of DDD. A distinctive syndrome of Dowling-Degos with HS (HS-DDD) (OMIM#613736))\nhas been identified, which is caused by heterozygous variants in PSENEN on 19q13 [54]. A study observed that, in the same family, only obese members carrying the pathogenic PSENEN c.62-1G >C splice variant developed HS-DDD, while their lean family members carrying the same mutation manifested DDD only [55]. The research group also observed that, in another family, nonsmoking, lean patients having the PSENEN 84_85insT variant developed DDD without HS [55]. These findings suggest that environmental factors, such as obesity and smoking, can influence phenotype of patients with the same genotype and highlight that environmental factors play a role in clinical manifestations of genetic predispositions, as environmental factors, such as obesity, diet, and infection, have been identified as predisposing or exacerbating factors in certain skin immunologic diseases, such as psoriasis [56\u201359]."

However, the classic triad of a triad of reticulated hyperpigmentation, dystrophic nails, and mucosal leukoplakia is not always observed in all individuals [60]. It is a hereditary disease that occurs predominantly in males, and the onset of DKC usually occurs in childhood between the ages of five and ten years [61]. DKC has been reported in many ethnic groups [42]. DKC manifests not only cutaneous features but also hematologic abnormalities, such as bone marrow failure, increasing risk of malignancies, pulmonary complications, and liver diseases [62]. The causative mutations of DKC are present in components of the telomerase complex. Some reports indicate that DKC is caused by defective telomere maintenance, which affects the proliferation of epithelial and hematopoietic cells and eventually leads to cellular senescence. Pigmentary changes in DKC are also attributed to increased melanin synthesis occurring in senescent melanocytes."

            "text": "DKC can be classified into three modes of inheritance: X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive [63,64]. Currently, there are 14 types of DKC identified, while only 10 genes are responsible for the 14 types of DKC. Mutations in the same gene may transmit in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pattern and therefore lead to different clinical manifestations and thus are defined as different types of DKC. X-linked recessive DKC (DKCX) (OMIM# 305000) is caused by the DKC1 gene located on chromosome Xq28, which encodes for dyskerin [64], which is involved in ribosome biogenesis and in stabilizing the telomerase complex [65]. Mutations in DKC1 mainly lead to amino acid substitutions. Autosomal dominant forms include DKCA2 (OMIM#613989), DKCA3 (OMIM#613990), DKCA4 (OMIM#615190), DKCA5 (Revesz Syndrome, OMIM#268130), and DKCA6 (OMIM#616553). DKCA2 is caused by mutations in the TERT gene on chromosome 5p15. The TERT gene encodes telomerase reverse transcriptase, which is the catalytic subunit of telomerase [66]. The mutated gene of DKCA3 is the TINF2 gene on chromosome 14q12. The TINF2 gene encodes TERF1-interacting nuclear factor 2, a critical subunit of the shelterin complex, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the length of telomeres [67]. DKCA4 is caused by mutations of the RTEL1 gene on chromosome 20q13 [68,69]. RTEL1 encodes the regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1, a DNA helicase which functions in the stability of telomeres [68]. DKCA5 (Revesz syndrome) is caused by mutations in the TINF2 gene, which is also the mutated gene of DKCA3. Revesz syndrome is regarded as a rare and extremely severe DKC with extracutaneous manifestations of bilateral exudative retinopathy, bone marrow hypoplasia, aplastic anemia, cerebellar hypoplasia, and growth retardation, in addition to cutaneous manifestations of nail dystrophy, fine hairs, and reticulate skin pigmentation [70]. DKCA6 is caused by mutations in the ACD gene on chromosome 16q22.\nThe ACD gene encodes the ACD shelterin complex subunit and telomerase recruitment factor, which is a core protein in shelterin complex and is involved in telomere function [71]. Autosomal recessive forms include DKCB1 (OMIM#224230), DKCB2 (OMIM# 613987), DKCB3 (OMIM#613988), DKCB4 (OMIM#613989), DKCB5 (OMIM#615190), DKCB6 (OMIM#616353), DKCB7 (OMIM#616553, the same OMIM code as DKCA6), and DKCB8 (OMIM#620133). The NOP10 gene, also known as NOLA3, is located on chromosome 15q14 and encodes NOP10 ribonucleoprotein, which is a component of the telomerase complex. The first-identified autosomal recessive form of DKC was DKCB1 [72]. The homozygosity mutations were detected in 16 consanguineous families with 25 affected individuals. DKCB2 is caused by mutations in the NHP2 gene on chromosome 5q35. NHP2 is also known as NOLA2 and encodes NHP2 ribonucleoprotein. The H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex is composed of an RNA molecule and four proteins: dyskerin, GAR1, NOP10, and NHP2, and the complex is responsible for telomere maintenance [64,73]. DKCB3 is caused by mutations in the WRAP53 gene on chromosome 17p13, which encodes an essential component of the telomerase holoenzyme complex required for telomere synthesis [74]. As in DKCA2, DKCB4 is caused by mutations in the TERT gene. Homozygous TERT mutations result in reduced telomerase activity and extremely short telomeres and can lead to a severe variant [75]. Similarly, DKCB5 is caused by homozygous or compound-heterozygous mutations of RTEL1, whose heterozygous mutation in the autosomal dominant form is DKCA4. The PARN gene is located on chromosome 16p13 and encodes poly(A)-specific ribonuclease. A mutation in the PARN gene causes poly(A)-specific ribonuclease deficiency that impacts telomere biology and leads to DKCB6 [76]. As mentioned earlier for DKCA6, protein products of the ACD gene participate in shelterin complex. Heterogeneous mutations of ACD genes from both parents have been reported and are referred to as DKCB7 [77]. The mutated gene responsible for DKCB8 is DCLRE1B, also known as SNM1B, on chromosome 1p13. DCLRE1B encodes the DNA cross-link repair 1B, which is involved in the repair of interstrand cross-links [78]. DKCB8 was reported by Kermasson et al. in three unrelated patients with homozygous or compound-heterozygous mutations in the DCLRE1B gene [79]."

In early literature, DPR consisted of a triad of reticulate hyperpigmentation, noncicatricial alopecia, and onychodystrophy [82]. Additionally, palmoplantar keratoderma with punctiform accentuation, widespread hyperkeratotic lesions, nail and ocular changes, ainhum formation, hypohidrosis, nonscarring\nblisters on the dorsal sides of the hands and feet, and pigmentation of the oral mucosa can be observed in patients with DPR [88,89]. Although the first case was reported in Switzerland, DPR has been reported in European and Asian countries [82,90]. The main differences between DPR and NFJS are that the former has lifelong cutaneous hyperpigmentation, presence of noncicatricial alopecia, and absence of dental anomalies [82,87]. The histological features showed pigmentary incontinence, vacuolar degeneration of the basal cell layer, and hyalinization of dermal collagen in the patients with DPR."

Additionally, certain studies have presented findings indicating increased apoptosis in the basal cell layer, where KRT14 is expressed, upon ultrastructural examination of affected skin. This suggests that apoptosis plays a significant role in the development of DPR, providing evidence for its pathogenesis [24]. It is noteworthy that both NFJS and DPR are autosomal dominant ectodermal dysplasia syndromes due to mutations of KRT14 but have different clusters of symptoms and signs, implying variations between genotypes and phenotypes. Specifically, revertant mosaicism has been reported in epidermolysis bullosa simplex due to KRT14 mutations [91\u201393]. It might be hypothesized that revertant mosaicism exists among clinical manifestations of the NFJS [94]."

It is characterized by different clinical and histological features according to sex. In males, it is characterized by prominent reticulate hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation and unique facial features, such as upswept frontal hairline and flared eyebrows, with systemic manifestations in various organs, including gastrointestinal inflammation, photophobia due to corneal opacification, recurrent respiratory infections, and failure to thrive [96,97]. Hypohidrosis is also a clinical feature [97]. Heterozygous females have milder disease than hemizygous males. In affected females, it is characterized by brown patchy pigmentary skin lesions along the lines of Blaschko, without known systemic manifestations [96,98]. The lines of Blaschko are attributed to the clonal proliferation of genetic mosaicism in keratinocytes that develop from postzygotic mutation during embryogenesis [99]. The distribution of pigmentation in female patients mimics stage 3 (hyperpigmented stage) incontinentia pigmenti, and both diseases are X-linked [100]. Other differential diagnoses of the pigmentary skin lesions along the lines of Blaschko include progressive cribriform and zosteriform hyperpigmentation (PCZH) and linear and whorled nevoid hypermelanosis (LWNH) [97]. Although the first reported case was in Canada, XLRPD has been identified in patients with different ancestry, including Maltese [101], Lebanonian [102], Korean [98], and Chinese [97]. Histopathological analysis shows mild hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, hyperpigmentation of the basal layer, and melanin incontinence in the upper dermis [96]. Electron-microscopic study shows a high number of melanosomes and some degenerating keratinocytes [102]."

            "text": "XLRPD is inherited as an X-linked trait [97]. The disorder is caused by a recurrent intronic mutation ((NM_016937.3:c.1375\u2013354A > G) in POLA1, which encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase-\u03b1 [103,104]. The intronic POLA1 mutation (c.1375\u2013354A > G), causing altered POLA1 gene splicing, leads to reduced transcript and protein levels [105]. POLA1 mutations in XLRPD are associated with reduced levels of cytosolic RNA/DNA hybrids, which results in the activation of type I interferons (IFNs) and upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes. The autoinflammatory manifestations, such as gastrointestinal inflammation and keratitis, may be due to the type I IFN activation [105]. It has been reported that patients with XLRPD have decreased numbers of natural killer (NK) cells and\nreduced NK cell toxicity, and the defect in NK cell function may partially account for the immunodeficiency status of patients with XLRPD [105]. As the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling is the downstream of type I IFN receptors, JAK inhibitors have been proposed as a treatment for XLRPD. In a report, the JAK1/3 inhibitor tofacitinib improved gastrointestinal inflammation and reduced the CRP level in a patient with XLRPD [105]."

            "text": "The mutated genes and clinical manifestations of inherited reticulate pigmentary disorders are summarized in Table 1. DSH, DUH, and RAK are primarily inherited reticulate pigmentary disorders in East Asians. The pattern and distribution of pigmentation differ among these three disorders, and these clinical manifestations are useful information for differential diagnoses in East Asians with reticulate pigmentary disorders. Identification of genetic mutations, however, is the gold standard for accurate diagnosis. DDD has been reported in different regions, although most cases are of European ancestry. The characteristic reticulate, with dot-like hyperpigmentation on flexural surfaces, provides diagnostic clues, while further genetic analysis is needed for identification of subtypes. DKC, NFJS, DPR, and XLRPD show no racial predilection. DKC is a severe disorder with multiple organ involvement due to mutations that involve dysfunction of telomerase complexes. NFJS and DPR are characteristic of their association with ectodermal dysplasia, with other clinical manifestations varying between them. XLRPD is X-linked, and male patients have reticulate hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation, while female patients have patchy pigmentation along the lines of Blaschko. Additionally, male patients with XLRPD have multiple cutaneous and extracutaneous manifestations, while female patients only have cutaneous pigmentation.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.-H.L., P.-C.C., I.-C.L., S.-F.Y., H.-S.Y. and S.Y.; literature review, M.-H.L., P.-C.C., I.-C.L., S.-F.Y. and S.Y.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.-H.L.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.-H.L., P.-C.C., I.-C.L., S.-F.Y., H.-S.Y. and S.Y.; supervision, H.-S.Y. and S.Y.; project administration, S.Y.; funding acquisition, S.Y.
