    "abstractText": "Semi-linear elliptic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) such as the non-linear Poisson Boltzmann Equation (nPBE) is highly relevant for non-linear electrostatics in computational biology and chemistry. It is of particular importance for modeling potential fields from molecules in solvents or plasmas with stochastic fluctuations. The extensive applications include ones in condensed matter and solid state physics, chemical physics, electrochemistry, biochemistry, thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and materials science, among others. In this paper we study the complex analytic properties of semi-linear elliptic Partial Differential Equations with respect to random fluctuations on the domain. We first prove the existence and uniqueness of the nPBE on a bounded domain in R. This proof relies on the application of a contraction mapping reasoning, as the standard convex optimization argument for the deterministic nPBE no longer applies. Using the existence and uniqueness result we subsequently show that solution to the nPBE admits an analytic extension onto a well defined region in the complex hyperplane with respect to the number of stochastic variables. Due to the analytic extension, stochastic collocation theory for sparse grids predict algebraic to sub-exponential convergence rates with respect to the number of knots. A series of numerical experiments with sparse grids is consistent with this prediction and the analyticity result. Finally, this approach readily extends to a wide class of semi-linear elliptic PDEs.",

In this paper we study the complex analytic properties of semi-linear elliptic Partial Differential Equations with respect to random fluctuations on the domain. We first prove the existence and uniqueness of the nPBE on a bounded domain in R3. This proof relies on the application of a contraction mapping reasoning, as the standard convex optimization argument for the deterministic nPBE no longer applies. Using the existence and uniqueness result we subsequently show that solution to the nPBE admits an analytic extension onto a well defined region in the complex hyperplane with respect to the number of stochastic variables. Due to the analytic extension, stochastic collocation theory for sparse grids predict algebraic to sub-exponential convergence rates with respect to the number of knots. A series of numerical experiments with sparse grids is consistent with this prediction and the analyticity result. Finally, this approach readily extends to a wide class of semi-linear elliptic PDEs.\nKeywords: Semi-linear Elliptic PDEs, dynamical systems, elliptic theory, linearization, fixed point theorem 2020 MSC: 35A01, 35A02, 35A20, 35G30, 65N35, 65N12, 65N15, 65C20"

            "text": "Linear elliptic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) have long been used to model problems in chemistry, physics, engineering and biology [31]. For example, the Poisson equation has been used extensively in electrical engineering to model potential fields in semi-conductors, leading to the capacitance extraction problem. However, as the physical scales are reduced, uncertainties in the shapes of semi-conductors leads to impedance matching problems [21, 88]. Moreover, many of these paradigms assume that the charge distribution (in a dielectric) is contained in a vacuum. This is not the case for many important problems that lead to non-linear electrostatics.\nNon-linear elliptic PDEs have also been of much interest, with applications to non-linear electrostatics, a subject that has gained much interest in modeling potential fields from molecules in solvents or plasma. Due to the interaction of the molecule and solvent (or plasma) a more accurate model is the non-linear elliptic PDE known as the non-linear Poisson Boltzmann Equation (nPBE). This model is well known in Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and chemical applications [38, 83]. As an example, it has been used in modeling electrode-electrolyte interfaces [85, 84, 68] and many related software packages have been developed [78, 49,\n\u22c6This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant No. 1736392.

As pointed out in [38] the nPBE has been investigated in biophysics [73, 76, 1, 10], surface science [48, 18], chemical physics [33, 52], polymer physics [67], plasma physics [86, 47], solid state physics [2, 53], condensed matter physics [24], many-body theory [17, 36], thermodynamics [37, 57], statistical mechanics [14, 56, 65], liquid state theory [40, 32, 60] , electrolyte solutions [8, 34], electrochemistry [80, 15, 82], soft matter [28, 27, 44, 77], physical chemistry [13, 3], biophysical chemistry [73, 29], biochemistry [11], medical physics [42], physiology [9, 43], molecular biology [81], colloids [18, 48, 87, 30, 46, 59], applied mathematics [19, 79, 58], materials science [25] and technology [62].\nThe nPBE is given by \u2212\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03f5(x)\u2207u) + \u03ba(x)2 sinhu = f, x \u2208 \u2126,\nu = g, x \u2208 \u2202\u2126, (1.1)\nwhere u is the nondimensionalized potential, \u03f5 is the dielectric, and \u03ba is the Debye-Hu\u0308ckel parameter. The nPBE has found important applications in protein interactions and molecular dynamics [74, 69]. In Figure 1 an example of the electrostatic potential field is rendered from the solution of the nPBE by using the Adaptive Poisson Boltzmann Solver (APBS) [7] for E. Coli RHo Protein. (PDB: 1A63 [12]). However, the mathematical properties of the nPBE are less understood and significantly more complicated than the linear case.\nIn practice may of these processes involve uncertainty in the dielectric material and the geometry leading to uncertainty in the potential field, so that the solution of the nPBE becomes stochastic. If we assume that uncertainty in the domain is parameterized by N random variables, then the solution of the nPBE is high dimensional and in many cases intractable. However, if sufficient complex analytic regularity of the solution with respect to the random variables exists, then it can shown that with a stochastic collocation method and a sparse grid polynomial representation, sub-exponential convergence is achieved [72, 71, 21, 23].\nIn [41] the authors investigate the application of stochastic collocation and stochastic Galerkin to the nPBE. In this paper the nPBE is posed as semi-linear stochastic boundary valued problem and it is proved that a unique solution exists, therefore extending the existence and uniqueness result for the determistic case from [45]. However, there are no analytic regularity results, thus no convergence rates are derived in implementing the stochastic collocation method. In this paper the main contributions are:\n\u2022 Proposition 3.2: We show existence and uniqueness of the complexified nPBE.\n\u2022 Theorem 4.1; We also show that an analytic extension of the solution of the nPBE exists with respect to the random variables that describe the domain.\nThe consequence of our results is that the stochastic nPBE can be solved with at least algebraic convergence with respect to the dimensionality of the sparse grid. Numerical results to study the convergence rates with respect to the dimensionality of the sparse grid are consistent with the analyticity results of Theorem 4.1.\nThis paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces notations and the fundamental mathematical background. In Section 3, the existence and uniqueness results are proved. In Section 4 the existence and uniqueness results are used to show that the solution to the nPBE admits an analytic extension in a well defined region in CN In Section 5 sparse grid tensor product polynomial approximations are discussed. The convergence rates predicted from the error bounds for sparse grids are consistent with the numerical experiments are performed in Section 6. In Section 7 final remarks and future work are discussed. In addition, In Appendix A, analytic estimates for the various constants used in this paper are shown and in Appendix B, a discussion on the failure of uniqueness of solutions is given."

To invoke the elliptic regularity theorem, let w \u2208 H2(\u2126). To motivate this assumption, consider the linear elliptic PDE Lu = f on \u2126 with u = g on \u2202\u2126. Assuming that w exists, a formal calculation reveals that u\u0303 + w is the solution where u\u0303 satisfies Lu\u0303 = f \u2212 Lw on \u2126 with u\u0303 = 0 on \u2202\u2126. If f \u2208 L2(\u2126), we desire Lw \u2208 L2(\u2126) to ensure that u\u0303 has two more derivatives than f \u2212 Lw. That w \u2208 H2(\u2126) follows by assuming g \u2208 H 32 (\u2202\u2126).\nLemma 2.1. [63, Theorem 3.37] Let T : C\u221e(\u2126) \u2192 C\u221e(\u2202\u2126) be given by u 7\u2192 u|\u2202\u2126.

More precisely, let u0 \u2208 H2(\u2126) be the solution for the linearized nPBE; by Lemma 3.1, there exists a unique weak solution u0 \u2208 H1(\u2126) and by Lemma 3.2, u0 \u2208 H2(\u2126). By the Sobolev embedding theorem, H2(\u2126) \u21aa\u2192 C0, 12 (\u2126), and therefore N(u0) \u2208 L2(\u2126). Then, consider\nLuk +N(uk\u22121) = f, k \u2265 1, uk = g,\n(3.9)\nor equivalently, uk = A(uk\u22121). It may be that the sequence is convergent to a function that does not solve (1.1) in any meaningful way; see [16]. By showing that A uniquely extends to a compact operator on fractional Sobolev spaces, it is shown that {uk} converges to a solution of (1.1). In the rest of this section, assume d = 3 unless specified otherwise.\nProposition 3.1. A : L\u221e(\u2126) \u2192 H2(\u2126) is locally Lipschitz continuous. Consequently, A is continuous on Hs(\u2126) for every s \u2208 ( 32 , 2]. Furthermore, A is compact on H s(\u2126) for every s \u2208 ( 32 , 2).\nProof. Let u, v \u2208 L\u221e(\u2126) with \u2225u\u2225L\u221e , \u2225v\u2225L\u221e(\u2126) \u2264M . Then from the Mean Value Theorem,\n\u2225A(u)\u2212A(v)\u2225H2 = \u2225K(N(u)\u2212N(v))\u2225H2 \u2264 CH\u2225N(u)\u2212N(v)\u2225L2 \u2264 CH\u2225u\u2212 v\u2225L\u221e \u222b 1 0 \u2225N \u2032((1\u2212 t)u+ tv)\u2225L2dt\n\u2264 CH\u2225\u03ba\u22252L\u221e\u2225u\u2212 v\u2225L\u221e \u222b 1 0 \u2211 k\u22652 k|nk|\u2225(1\u2212 t)u+ tv\u2225k\u22121L2(k\u22121)dt\n\u2264 { CH\u2225\u03ba\u22252L\u221e |\u2126| 1 2 \u2211 k\u22652 k|nk|2k\u22122(\u2225u\u2225k\u22121L\u221e + \u2225u\u2225 k\u22121 L\u221e ) } \u2225u\u2212 v\u2225L\u221e .\n(3.10)\nIf we show that the series in Equation (3.10) converges, then the proof is complete. By the Cauchy integral formula, we obtain an upper bound on |nk|\n|nk| \u2264 max |z|=R\n|N(z)|\nRk ,\nand combining this bound for R = 4M with Equation (3.10), the infinite sum is a convergent geometric series, and therefore the desired continuity has been shown.\nThe rest follows from the Sobolev embedding and the Rellich-Kondrachov compactness theorem. Indeed, the continuity of A on Hs(\u2126) follows by considering the embedding Hs(\u2126) \u21aa\u2192 L\u221e(\u2126). Compactness of A on Hs(\u2126) is immediate once we show A sends a bounded subset of Hs(\u2126) into a bounded subset of H2(\u2126). For \u2225u\u2225Hs \u2264M ,\n\u2225A(u)\u2225H2 = \u2225K(f \u2212N(u)\u2212 Lw) + w\u2225H2 \u2264 CH\u2225f \u2212N(u)\u2212 Lw\u2225L2 + \u2225w\u2225H2 \u2264 CH\u2225f\u2225L2 + (CHCD + 1)\u2225w\u2225H2 + CH\u2225N(u)\u2225L2\n\u2264 CH\u2225f\u2225L2 + (CHCD + 1)\u2225w\u2225H2 + CH\u2225\u03ba\u22252L\u221e |\u2126| 1 2 \u221e\u2211 k=2 |nk|(CS(s)M)k, (3.11)\nwhere Equation (3.11) follows from Equation (3.7).\nNow we apply the a priori estimate above to obtain a strong solution to Equation (1.1).\nProposition 3.2. Let s \u2208 ( 32 , 2) and M > 0 satisfy\nCH\u2225f\u2225L2 + (CHCD + 1)\u2225w\u2225H2 + CH\u2225\u03ba\u22252L\u221e |\u2126| 1 2 \u221e\u2211 k=2 |nk|(CS(s)M)k \u2264M. (3.12)\nThen there exists a strong solution u \u2208 H2(\u2126) to (1.1) with \u2225u\u2225Hs \u2264M . If the condition\nCHCS(s)\u2225\u03ba\u22252L\u221e |\u2126| 1 2 \u221e\u2211 k=2 k|nk|(CS(s)M)k\u22121 < 1, (3.13)\nholds in addition to (3.12), then u \u2208 H2(\u2126) is unique in BHs(0,M).\nProof. Let \u2225u\u2225Hs \u2264M . Then, a similar argument to (3.11) yields \u2225A(u)\u2225Hs \u2264M . By Schauder\u2019s fixed point theorem ([35, Corollary 11.2]) on BHs(0,M), a closed convex subset of H\ns(\u2126) on which A is continuous and compact by Proposition 3.1, we obtain u \u2208 BHs(0,M) such that A(u) = u. Since A is smoothing, u \u2208 H2(\u2126).\nFollowing the steps leading to Equation (3.10), we obtain\n\u2225A(u)\u2212A(v)\u2225Hs \u2264 ( CHCS(s)\u2225\u03ba\u22252L\u221e |\u2126| 1 2 \u221e\u2211 k=2 k|nk|(CSM)k\u22121 ) \u2225u\u2212 v\u2225Hs , (3.14)\nwhere the strict contraction of A on BHs(0,M) follows from (3.13) and the Banach fixed point theorem.\nRemark 3.3. When N(u) = sinhu, there exists M > 0 that satisfies (3.12) if and only if\ny0 := CH\u2225f\u2225L2 + (CHCD + 1)\u2225w\u2225H2\nis sufficiently small such that\ny0 + CH\u2225\u03ba\u22252L\u221e |\u2126| 1 2 (sinhCSM0 \u2212 CSM0) \u2264M0 (3.15)\nwhere\nM0 = C \u22121 S cosh\n\u22121(1 + 1\nCHCS\u2225\u03ba\u22252L\u221e |\u2126|1/2 ), (3.16)\nwhich is independent of \u2225f\u2225L2 , \u2225w\u2225H2 . Hence the maximum value of y0 that satisfies (3.15) in the equality is\ny\u22170 =M0 \u2212 CH\u2225\u03ba\u22252L\u221e |\u2126| 1 2 (sinhCSM0 \u2212 CSM0)\n= C\u22121S ( (1 + CHCS\u2225\u03ba\u22252L\u221e |\u2126|1/2) cosh \u22121 ( 1 +\n1\nCHCS\u2225\u03ba\u22252L\u221e |\u2126|1/2\n) \u2212 \u221a 1 + 2CHCS\u2225\u03ba\u22252L\u221e |\u2126|1/2 ) ,\n(3.17)\nwhich can be shown to be strictly positive. Note that there exists C > 0 such that y\u22170(\u2225\u03ba\u2225\u221e) \u223c C\u22121S ln ( C\n\u2225\u03ba\u22252L\u221e\n) as \u2225\u03ba\u2225\u221e \u2192 0,\nwith other parameters fixed, which is consistent with the global existence and uniqueness of (1.1) with \u03ba = 0 where (1.1) reduces to the linear PBE.\nGiven that (3.15) holds and y0 \u2264 y\u22170 , the uniqueness condition (3.13) is equivalent toM < M0. Therefore if y0 < y \u2217 0 , there exists a strong solution u \u2208 H2(\u2126) unique in {\u2225u\u2225Hs < M0} by choosing M = M0 \u2212 \u03f5 for \u03f5 > 0 sufficiently small. On the other hand, uniqueness is not guaranteed if y0 = y \u2217 0 .\nThe equality case of (3.15) when y0 = y \u2217 0 is illustrated in Figure 2. The curve M 7\u2192 F (\u00b7, y\u22170) tangentially\nintersects the identity.\nRemark 3.4. As can be shown in (3.12), (3.13) our fixed point approach works for small data where the given parameters must be small measured in various norms. For complexified nPBE, however, this restriction is necessary if we wish to preserve uniqueness of solution; see Proposition B.1. On the other hand, our approach establishes existence and uniqueness for a wide class of nonlinearities that may grow super-linearly.\nIn the spirit of Propositions 3.1 and 3.2, the (local) Lipschitz continuity of A on Sobolev spaces can be shown with more restrictive hypotheses. Denote A \u2272 B whenever there exists an implicit constant C > 0 dependent only on the given parameters such that A \u2264 CB.\nCorollary 3.1. Let s > d2 and \u03c3 \u2264 s \u2264 \u03c3 + 2 for \u03c3 \u2208 N \u222a {0}, and assume \u03f5 \u2208 C \u03c3+1(\u2126), \u03ba \u2208 Hs(\u2126) and \u2202\u2126 is C\u03c3+2. For any given f \u2208 H\u03c3(\u2126), g \u2208 H\u03c3+ 32 (\u2202\u2126), it follows that A : Hs(\u2126) \u2192 H\u03c3+2(\u2126) is locally Lipschitz continuous. Hence for s > d2 and \u03c3 \u2264 s < \u03c3 + 2, there exists a unique fixed point for A in BHs(\u2126)(0, R) \u2286 Hs(\u2126) for some R > 0, if the smallness hypotheses analogous to Equations (3.13) and (3.14) are assumed.\nProof. By the Elliptic Regularity Theorem and the Mean Value Theorem,\n\u2225A(u)\u2212A(v)\u2225H\u03c3+2 = \u2225K(N(u)\u2212N(v))\u2225H\u03c3+2 \u2272 \u2225N(u)\u2212N(v)\u2225H\u03c3 \u2272 \u2225\u03ba\u22252Hs\u2225u\u2212 v\u2225Hs \u222b 1 0 \u2225N \u2032((1\u2212 t)u+ tv)\u2225Hsdt. (3.18)\nThe rest is analogous to the proofs of Propositions 3.1 and 3.2 using the Sobolev algebra property and the fixed point arguments."

In the spirit of uncertainty quantification, the coefficient functions v := (\u03f5, \u03ba, f, g) are assumed to depend on y := (y1, . . . , yN ) \u2208 \u0393 = [\u22121, 1]N where \u0393 denotes the stochastic domain. Suppose the coefficient functions admit analytic extensions to \u0398 \u2286 CN containing \u0393; the notation z := (z1, . . . , zN ) \u2208 \u0398 is used to denote the complexification of y. For convenience, absorb the boundary data and consider\n\u2212\u2207x \u00b7 (\u03f5(x,y)\u2207xv(x,y)) + \u03ba(x,y)2 sinh (v(x,y) + w(x,y)) = f(x,y) +\u2207x \u00b7 (\u03f5(x,y)\u2207xw(x,y)), x \u2208 \u2126, v(x,y) = 0, x \u2208 \u2202\u2126,\n(4.1) where y \u2208 \u0393 and u = v + w is the solution to (1.1).\nHypothesis 4. (Finite Dimensional Noise Model) We assume that that fluctuations of the components of v are modeled as\nv(x,y) := \u03be\u2126(x) + N\u2211 i=0 \u03b1i\u03d5(x)yi\nwhere \u03b1i \u2208 R, \u03be\u2126 is the indicator function defined on \u2126 and \u03d5i \u2208 [C\u221e(\u2126)]4 \u2229 [L2(\u2126)]4 for i = 1, . . . , N .\nRemark 4.1. Suppose we have a complete probability space (\u2126P,F ,P), where \u2126P is the set of outcomes, F is the sigma algebra and P is the associated probability measure. The stochastic fluctuations are modeled by \u0393 = [\u22121, 1]N reflects the finite-dimensional noise assumption that the coefficient functions are random inputs described by N real-valued random variables {Yk(wp)}Nk=1 for wp \u2208 \u2126P with mean zero and unit variance where the domain \u0393 may also be unbounded as described in [4]. Hence v(x,wp) :=[ \u03f5(x,wp) \u03ba(x,wp) f(x,wp) g(x,wp)\n]T \u2208 L2P(\u2126; [L2(\u2126)]4) can be represented by the expansion v(x,wp) = E[v(x,wp)] +\nN\u2211 k=1 \u221a \u03bbk\u03d5k(x)Yk(wp), \u03bbk \u2265 0.\nIf the covariance structure of v were known, then (\u03bbk,\u03d5k) N k=1 forms the eigenbasis of the covariance matrix and therefore by orthogonality (see [20, Section 2] for an introduction to the vector-field Karhunen-Loe\u0300ve transform),\nYk(wp) = 1\u221a \u03bbk \u222b \u2126 (v(x,wp)\u2212 E[v(x,wp)])T\u03d5k(x)dx.\nRemark 4.2. Due to the KL truncation the coefficients \u03f5 and \u03ba can become negative i.e. the truncation does not guarantee that the expansion of \u03f5 and \u03ba are always positive and thus a solution might not exist. This problem is circumvented by taking to the KL expansion of v and replacing \u03f5 and \u03ba with the terms log(\u03f5\u2212 amin), min{\u03f5} > amin > 0 and log(\u03ba) respectively. An exponential is then applied to the truncated KL expansion of v. This will guarantee that \u03f5 and \u03ba will always be positive.\nFurthermore the analytic extension of u(y) from y \u2208 \u0393 to an open subset \u0398 \u2286 CN containing a Bernstein polyellipse E\u03c11 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 E\u03c1N \u2286 \u0398 containing \u0393 with \u03c1i > 1, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N implies a algebraic or sub-exponential convergence of the surrogate model to the exact solution with respect to the number of collocation points used in the sparse grid approximation as shown in [4, Lemma 4.4].\nFor the next proposition, let \u03f5(z) := \u03f5(\u00b7, z) \u2208 W 1,\u221e(\u2126;C) be a scalar field for z \u2208 C satisfying Re(\u03f5(x, z)) \u2265 \u03b8 > 0 for all x \u2208 \u2126.\nTheorem 4.1. Suppose \u03f5, \u03ba, f, w admit analytic extensions from \u0393 to an open subset \u0398 \u2286 CN such that for all z \u2208 \u0398, the following quantitative bounds hold\n0 < d2\u2126 < \u03c0 2\u03b8CH ,\nCH\u2225f(z)\u2225L2 + (CHCD + 1)\u2225w(z)\u2225H2 < y\u22170(z),\n\u2225\u03ba(z)\u22252L\u221e \u2264 \u03c02\u03b8 d2\u2126 \u2212 1 CH ,\n(4.2)\nwith y\u22170 defined as (3.17). Then the solution map \u0398 \u2192 H2(\u2126) given by z 7\u2192 u(z) is complex-analytic.\nRemark 4.3. The upper bound on d\u2126 > 0 and the size restriction on \u0398 are sufficient conditions in Theorem 4.1, but need not be necessary. To elaborate on the smallness of d\u2126 > 0, we have\nCH \u2265 C\u22121D \u2265 1\n18\u2225\u03f5\u2225W 1,\u221e + \u2225\u03ba\u22252L\u221e ,\nby Definition 3.2 and (A.1).

By the Hartog\u2019s Theorem [54, Chap 1], any separately holomorphic functions are continuous on \u0398, and therefore analytic on the Bernstein polyellipse by the Osgood\u2019s Lemma [39, Chap 1]. Let z = (zn; z \u2032 n) \u2208 \u0398 where zn is the nth coordinate of z and z\u2032n is the rest of the coordinates. Let s := \u211czn, \u03c9 := \u2111zn. Based on the proof of [23, Lemma 8], the existence of the partial derivatives of the solution (\u2202su, \u2202\u03c9u) is justified, after which, u(z) is shown to satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equation in zn by taking the complex derivatives of (4.1).\nBy (4.2), the nPBE (4.1) admits a solution v : \u0398 \u2192 H10 (\u2126) \u2229 H2(\u2126) unique in BHs(\u2126)(0,M0) by Remark 3.3. Let \u03b61, \u03b62 be the formal derivatives \u2202svR, \u2202svI , respectively.

Adopting the argument in [23, Lemma 8] where (4.1) is considered in its weak form, it can be shown that \u2202svR(z), \u2202svI(z) exist for every z \u2208 \u0398 and\n\u03b61(z) = \u2202svR(z), \u03b62(z) = \u2202svI(z),\nwhile taking the formal derivative of (4.1) in the imaginary variable yields an analogous conclusion for \u2202\u03c9v. Let P (x, z) = \u2202svR(z) \u2212 \u2202\u03c9vI(z) and Q(x, z) = \u2202\u03c9vR(z) + \u2202svI(z). By taking the partial derivatives of (4.1) and using the Cauchy-Riemann equations satisfied by the coefficient functions given by the hypotheses, one can argue as (22) of [21] that P,Q satisfy (4.3) with \u03b61 = P, \u03b62 = Q and f1 = f2 = 0 under the zero Dirichlet boundary condition. By the Lax-Milgram Theorem, P (zn; z \u2032 n) = Q(zn; z \u2032 n) = 0 for all\nzn \u2208 \u0398(z\u2032n) := {\u03b6 \u2208 C : (\u03b6; z\u2032n) \u2208 \u0398}, for each z\u2032n. Since v : \u0398 \u2192 H10 (\u2126) \u2229 H2(\u2126) defines a complex-analytic map, so does u = v + w define a H2(\u2126)-valued analytic map.

            "text": "Consider the problem of approximating a function \u03bd : \u0393 \u2192 W on the domain \u0393 and Banach space W . The goal is to efficiently approximate such a function using tensor product polynomials. The accuracy of the polymonial representation will depend on the existence of an analytic extension of \u03bd onto the complex domain \u0398 \u2282 CN . In this section we introduce a brief discussion of sparse grids, which have become a popular method for approximating functions with complex analytic extensions. A more detail exposition can be found in [4, 72, 21, 23].\nLet Pp(\u0393\u0303) := span(yk, k = 0, . . . , p) and consider the univariate function \u03bd : \u0393\u0303 \u2192 W , \u0393\u0303 = [\u22121, 1] and univariate Lagrange interpolant Im(i)p : C0(\u0393\u0303) \u2192 Pm(i)\u22121(\u0393\u0303) such that\nIm(i)p (\u03bd(y)) := m(i)\u2211 k=1 \u03bd(\u00b7, yk)lpk(y),\nwhere i \u2265 0 is the level of approximation and m(i) \u2208 N0 is the number of evaluation points at level i \u2208 N0, m(0) = 0, m(1) = 1 and m(i) \u2264 m(i+ 1) if i \u2265 1. By convention, for m(0) = 0, let P\u22121 = \u2205. Furthermore, the Lagrange polynomials lpk form a basis for Pp(\u0393\u0303).\nThe Lagrange interpolant can be easily extended to N dimensions by taking tensor products. Let Pp(\u0393) = \u2297N n=1 Ppn(\u0393n) be an index of polynomial degree along each dimension of \u0393. The interpolant Ip : C0(\u0393) \u2192 Pp(\u0393) can be constructed as Ip := Im(i)p1 \u2297 I m(i) p2 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 I m(i) pN . Thus for any function \u03bd : \u0393 \u2192W we have that Ip(\u03bd(y)) =\n\u2211 k\u2208K \u03bd(\u00b7,yk)lpk (y),\nwhere K is an appropriate index set and lpk (y) are tensors of univariate Lagrange polynomials. However, the dimensionality of Pp and the index set K increases as \u220fN n=1 (pn + 1) with N . This polynomial representation suffers from the curse of dimensionality and becomes intractable for even a moderate amount of dimensions [50]. In contrast, if sufficient regularity of \u03bd(y) exists with respect to y \u2208 \u0393 the dimensionality of the polynomial approximation can be significantly reduced by restricting the degree of the tensor product polynomial along each dimension.\nConsider the difference operator along the nth dimension of \u0393\n\u2206m(i)p,n :=Im(i)p \u2212 Im(i\u22121)p .\nLet i = (i1, . . . , iN ) \u2208 NN+ be a multi-index, w be the level of approximation of the sparse grid and g : NN+ \u2192 N be a restriction function that acts on i. The sparse grid approximation of \u03bd is constructed as\nSm,gw [\u03bd] = \u2211\ni\u2208NN+ :g(i)\u2264w\nN\u2297 n=1 \u2206m(in)n (\u03bd(y)).\nBy choosing the function m(i) and g appropriately the dimensionality of the sparse grid can be controlled. The Smolyak sparse grid [72] can be built with the following formulas:\nm(i) =\n{ 1, for i = 1\n2i\u22121 + 1, for i > 1 and g(i) = N\u2211 n=1 (in \u2212 1),\nwhere\nf(p) =  0, p = 0 1, p = 1\n\u2308log2(p)\u2309, p \u2265 2 .\nThe second step is to choose the location of the knots yk. For the domain \u0393 a good choice is the ClenshawCurtis (CC) abscissa [70]. This consists of the extrema of Chebyshev polynomials:\nynj = \u2212cos ( \u03c0(j \u2212 1) m(i)\u2212 1 ) ,\nRemark 5.1. Note that isotropic sparse grids can be extended to anisotropic setting. By adapting the function g to the contribution of each dimension to the function \u03bd(y), higher convergence rates can be achieved [71].\nWe are now interested in obtaining bounds for the error of the sparse grid i.e. \u2225\u03bd \u2212Sm,gv [\u03bd]\u2225L\u221e(\u0393). This bound can be shown to be controlled by i) the number of dimensions N , ii) the number of knots \u03b7 in the sparse grid, but most importantly iii) the size of the region of complex region of the analytic extension of \u03bd(y) onto CN .\nLet E\u03c3\u03021,...,\u03c3\u0302N := \u03a0Nn=1En,\u03c3\u0302n \u2282 CN , where\nEn,\u03c3\u0302n = { z \u2208 C with Re z = e \u03b4n + e\u2212\u03b4n\n2 cos(\u03b8), Im z = e\u03b4n \u2212 e\u2212\u03b4n 2\nsin(\u03b8) : \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0), \u03c3\u0302n \u2265 \u03b4n \u2265 0 }\nand \u03c3\u0302n > 0. It is known that if a function u : \u0393\u0303 \u2192 R can be analytically extended onto the Bernstein ellipse En,\u03c3\u0302n then the error of the Lagrange interpolation of u will decay exponentially with respect to the parameter \u03c3\u0302n > 0 [23]. This result has been extended to sparse grid polynomials in [72, 71] on suitable Banach spaces. However, the converge rate can was shown to be algebraic or sub-exponential.\nWe set \u03c3\u0302 \u2261 minn=1,...,N \u03c3\u0302n, i.e. the decay is going to controlled by the Bernstein ellipse with the smallest size. This setting corresponds to an isotropic sparse grid.

Suppose that \u03bd \u2208 C0(\u0393;R) admits an analytic extension on E\u03c3\u03021,...,\u03c3\u0302N and is absolutely bounded by M\u0303(\u03bd).

(5.2)\nProof. Theorem 3.10 and 3.11 in [72].\nNote that in many practical cases not all dimensions of \u0393 are equally important. In these cases the dimensionality of the sparse grid can be significantly reduced by exploiting the size of each Bernstein ellipse. By adapting the restriction function g to the \u03c3n along each dimension, a anisotropic sparse grid is produced with higher convergence rates with respect to the number of knots \u03b7 [71]."

            "text": "In this section we test the analyticity result by studying the statistical behaviour of a quantity of interest of the potential field of the Trypsin protein in a solvent. The Trypsin protein molecule (PDB:1ppe [12]) consists of n = 1, 852 atoms. We use the Adaptive Poisson Boltzmann Solver (APBS) [7] for the computation of potential field on a rectangular domain of size 70\u00d7 70\u00d7 70 A\u030angstroms and set \u2202\u2126 with Dirichlet boundary conditions equal to zero. The temperature of the solvent is set to 310 Kelvin (human body temperature).\nLet C be the collection of point charges in the Trypsin molecule. The Domain \u2126 is split into an internal component AI , representing the domain of the molecule that is constructed from the APBS code and AE , which corresponds to the solvent. The point charges x1, . . .xn correspond to the center of each atom in Trypsin. However, the APBS code replaces these point charges with functions in L2(\u2126). See Figure 3 (a) for a cartoon example.\nWe now built the stochastic model and shift the point charges in C as follows:\nC(\u03c9) = {x = x0 + N\u2211\nk=1\n\u03b1kekYk(\u03c9) |x0 \u2208 C},\nwhere e1 = [1, 0, 0] T , e2 = [0, 1, 0] T , e3 = [0, 0, 1] T , \u03b11 = \u03b12 = \u03b13 = 10, N \u2264 3, and Y1(\u03c9), Y2(\u03c9), Y3(\u03c9) are uniformly distributed over the domain [\u2212 \u221a 3, \u221a 3] and independent of each other. The internal domain AI(\u03c9) and external domains AE(\u03c9) are then formed. For the internal domain the dielectric \u03f5I(\u03c9) is assumed to be a constant and \u03baI(\u03c9) = 0. For the external domain the dielectric \u03f5E(\u03c9) and \u03baE(\u03c9) are assumed to be constants. Note that this is common assumption for potential field computational packages such as APBS. Furthermore, the point charges x1(\u03c9), . . .xn(\u03c9) are shifted as follows\nxk(x\u2212 x0) \u2192 xk ( x\u2212 x0 \u2212\nN\u2211 k=1 \u03b1kekYk(\u03c9)\n) ,\nGiven this stochastic model we computed the expected valued of the spatial mean of the potential field E [Q], where\nQ := \u222b \u2126 u(Y1, . . . , YN ) dx\nwith respect to stochastic domain shifts.

The level of the sparse grid is set from w = 2, 3, 4, 5. Since we do not have analytic results we assume that E [Q(u)] for w = 5 is the actual solution. In Figure 3 (b) the convergence graphs of accuracy vs dimensionality of the sparse grid (Work) are plotted for w = 2, 3, 4). Observe that the convergence rate is faster than algebraic.

Our theoretical predictions were tested by numerically verifying the convergence rate of the sparse grid stochastic collocation approximation with Clenshaw-Curtis abcissas.\nThe biggest difference between our model and the real-valued nPBE equation stems from the nonconvexity of the nonlinearity on C, which makes it difficult to directly apply variational calculus to our\nmodel. See [45, Theorem 2.14] that used the variational approach based on convexity to study the real nPBE.\nOur future work will focus on the theoretical and numerical studies of nPBE for discontinuous dielectric interface, which more accurately describes the underlying physics. In the Debye-Hu\u0308ckel model, a collection of macromolecules such as proteins is located in the region \u21261 \u2286 R3, surrounded by the ion-exclusion layer \u21262, which in turn is surrounded by the solvent of positive and negative charges in \u21263.

Therefore, it is of interest to develop the functional-analytic framework to study the nPBE with non-trivial interfaces that extends the traditional Debye-Hu\u0308ckel model given by (7.1).\nAppendices"

By the triangle inequality, \u2225\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03f5\u2207v)\u2225L2 = \u2225 \u2211 i,j \u2202i(\u03f5 ij\u2202jv)\u2225L2 \u2264 \u2211 i,j \u2225\u2202i(\u03f5ij\u2202jv)\u2225L2 \u2264 \u2211 i,j \u2225\u2202i\u03f5ij\u2202jv\u2225L2 + \u2225\u03f5ij\u2202ijv\u2225L2\n\u2264 \u2211 i,j (\u2225\u2202i\u03f5ij\u2225L\u221e + \u2225\u03f5ij\u2225L\u221e)\u2225v\u2225H2 \u2264 2d2\u2225\u03f5\u2225W 1,\u221e\u2225v\u2225H2 ,\nand hence (A.1).\nA.2. Estimates for CS(2).\nIn this subsection, we are interested in obtaining an upper bound of the operator norm ofH2(\u2126) \u21aa\u2192 L\u221e(\u2126) where \u2126 \u2286 R3. To obtain this Sobolev inequality constant, a standard trick is to obtain the desired constant for the full domain Rd. Any reasonably regular function defined on \u2126 can be extended to Rd via an extension operator. Composing these two, one obtains a Sobolev inequality on \u2126. See [31, Chapter 5] for an exposition of this material. To apply the estimates obtained in [66], we lay out the following notation. For 1 \u2264 p < q \u2264 \u221e, let Cp,q, Dp,q > 0 such that for every v \u2208W 1,p(\u2126) and v\u2126 := |\u2126|\u22121 \u222b \u2126 v,\n\u2225v\u2225Lq(\u2126) \u2264 Cp,q\u2225v\u2225W 1,p(\u2126), \u2225v \u2212 v\u2126\u2225Lq(\u2126) \u2264 Dp,q\u2225\u2207v\u2225Lp(\u2126). (A.2)\nTo estimate C2,p and Cp,\u221e, we cite\nLemma A.2. [66, Theorem 2.1] For \u2126 \u2286 Rd, if Dp,q > 0 is given as (A.2), then\nCp,q = 2 1\u2212 1p max(|\u2126| 1 q\u2212 1 p , Dp,q).\nThe estimation for the Sobolev embedding constant, therefore, reduces to computing Dp,q, which is summarized in the following two lemmas:\nLemma A.3. [66, Theorem 3.2] Let p \u2208 (2, 6] and v \u2208 H1(\u2126) where we further suppose that \u2126 is convex. Then, we have \u2225v \u2212 v\u2126\u2225Lp(\u2126) \u2264 D2,p\u2225\u2207v\u2225L2(\u2126) with\nD2,p = d 1+\n3(p+2) 2p\n\u2126 \u03c0 3(p+2) 4p 3|\u2126| \u0393( 3(p\u22122)4p )\n\u0393( 3(p+2)4p ) \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a \u0393( 3p ) \u0393( 3(p\u22121)p ) ( 4\u221a \u03c0 ) p\u22122 2p . (A.3)\nHence C2,p = 2 1 2 max(|\u2126| 1 p\u2212 1 2 , D2,p).\nLemma A.4. [66, Theorem 3.4] For p > 3 and v \u2208W 1,p(\u2126), we have \u2225v \u2212 v\u2126\u2225L\u221e \u2264 Dp,\u221e\u2225\u2207v\u2225Lp with\nDp,\u221e = d3\u2126 3|\u2126| \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223|x|\u22122\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 Lp\u2032 (V ) , (A.4)\nwhere \u2126x := {x\u2212 y : y \u2208 \u2126} and V = \u22c3\nx\u2208\u2126 \u2126x.\n1 Hence\nCp,\u221e = 2 1\u2212 1p max(|\u2126|\u2212 1 p , Dp,\u221e).\nOur proof for the existence of solution depends on the size of the Sobolev inequality constant.\nLemma A.5. For every p \u2208 (3, 6) and \u2126 \u2286 R3 bounded and convex, we have\n|\u2126|\u2212 12 \u2264 CS(2) \u2264 2 1 pC2,pCp,\u221e,\nwhere for 1 \u2264 p < q \u2264 \u221e, denote Cp,q > 0 by a constant such that for every u \u2208W 1,p(\u2126)\n\u2225v\u2225Lq(\u2126) \u2264 Cp,q\u2225v\u2225W 1,p(\u2126).\nIf we further assume that |\u2126| = Cd3\u2126 for some C > 0, then there exists d0 > 0 such that for every d\u2126 \u2264 d0,\n|\u2126|\u2212 12 \u2264 CS(2) \u2264 2 3 2 |\u2126|\u2212 12 .\nProof. Consider the embedding H2(\u2126) \u21aa\u2192 W 1,p(\u2126) \u21aa\u2192 L\u221e(\u2126), which is continuous when p \u2208 (3, 6). From the first embedding, we obtain\n\u2225v\u2225pW 1,p = \u2225v\u2225 p Lp + d\u2211 i=1 \u2225\u2202iv\u2225p\n\u2264 Cp2,p\u2225v\u2225 p H1 + C p 2,p d\u2211 i=1 \u2225\u2202iv\u2225pH1 \u2264 C p 2,p\u2225v\u2225 p H1 + C p 2,p ( d\u2211 i=1 \u2225\u2202iv\u22252H1 )p/2 \u2264 Cp2,p\u2225v\u2225 p H1 + C p 2,p\u2225v\u2225 p H2 \u2264 2C p 2,p\u2225v\u2225 p H2 ,\nand from the second embedding, \u2225v\u2225L\u221e \u2264 Cp,\u221e\u2225v\u2225W 1,p .\n1p\u2032 := p p\u22121 denotes the Ho\u0308lder conjugate of p.\nCombining the two, we obtain the upper bound. For the lower bound, consider a family of constant functions defined on \u2126. Then\n\u2225c\u2225L\u221e \u2225c\u2225H2 = \u2225c\u2225L\u221e \u2225c\u2225L2 = |\u2126|\u2212 12 \u2264 CS(2).\nNow we assume |\u2126| = Cd3\u2126 for some C > 0 and give a sharp bound for CS(2) for d\u2126 sufficiently small. Note that this hypothesis includes domains such as a ball B(0, R) \u2286 R3 or a cube [\u2212R,R]3 for R > 0.\nSince D2,p = C(p)d 3 p\u2212 1 2 \u2126 by Equation (A.3) and |\u2126| 1 p\u2212 1 2 = (Cd3\u2126) 1 p\u2212 1 2 , we have\nC2,p = 2 1 2 |\u2126| 1 p\u2212 1 2 , (A.5)\nfor all d\u2126 \u2264 d0(p) for some d0(p) > 0. On the other hand, we may translate the domain and assume d\u2126 2 = sup\nx\u2208\u2126 |x|. Then, V \u2286 B(0, d\u2126) and\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223|x|\u22122\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223p\u2032 Lp\u2032 (V ) \u2264 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223|x|\u22122\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223p\u2032 Lp\u2032 (B(0,d\u2126)) = 4\u03c0 \u222b d\u2126 0 r\u22122p \u2032+2dr =\n4\u03c0\n\u22122p\u2032 + 3 d\u22122p \u2032+3 \u2126 ,\nand thus Dp,\u221e = C \u2032(p)d \u2212 3p+1 \u2126 by Equation (A.4), and we have\nCp,\u221e = 2 1\u2212 1p |\u2126|\u2212 1 p , (A.6)\nfor all d\u2126 \u2264 d\u20320(p) for some d\u20320(p) > 0. Combining Equation (A.5) and Equation (A.6), we have\n|\u2126|\u2212 12 \u2264 CS(2) \u2264 2 3 2 |\u2126|\u2212 12 ,\nfor all d\u2126 sufficiently small.\nA.3. Estimates for CH .\nTo do a numerical simulation, it is of interest to obtain an estimate for the elliptic regularity constant CH > 0. In applications, the tensor \u03f5 is usually assumed to be a scalar-valued function, in which case, an estimate for CH can be obtained by the Fourier transform:\nf\u0302(\u03be) = \u222b Rd f(x)e\u2212ix\u00b7\u03bed\u03be and f(x) = (2\u03c0)\u2212d \u222b Rd f\u0302(\u03be)eix\u00b7\u03bed\u03be.\nFor any s \u2208 R, define Hs(Rd) = {f \u2208 S \u2032 : \u27e8\u03be\u27e9sf\u0302 \u2208 L2(Rd)},\nwhere \u27e8\u03be\u27e9 := (1 + |\u03be|2) 12 and S \u2032 is the space of tempered distributions.\nLemma A.6. Let L be as in Equation (3.5). Furthermore, suppose \u03f5ij = \u03f5(x)\u03b4ij where \u03b4ij is the Kronecker delta function and \u03f5 \u2208W 1,\u221e(\u2126) such that Re(\u03f5(x)) \u2265 \u03b8 > 0 for all x \u2208 \u2126. Then\nCH \u2264 \u03bb\u221211 \u27e8\u03bb 1 3 1 \u27e93\n\u03b8\n1 + \u2225\u03ba2\u2225L\u221e(\u2126) + d 1 2 max 1\u2264i\u2264d \u2225\u2202i\u03f5\u2225L\u221e(\u2126)\u03bb 1 2 1\n\u03b8\u03bb1 \u2212 \u00b5  . (A.7) Proof. Given F \u2208 L2(\u2126) and a unique weak solution u \u2208 H10 (\u2126) of the Laplace equation \u2212\u2206u = F in \u2126, we find C1 > 0 such that \u2225u\u2225H2(\u2126) \u2264 C1\u2225F\u2225L2(\u2126). We use this energy estimate to handle the more complicated case.\nBy the density argument, it suffices to assume F \u2208 C\u221ec (\u2126). By an integration-by-parts argument, it can be shown that u \u2208 C2c (\u2126). Hence, we extend u to a function in C2c (Rd), which we continue to call u, by defining u(x) = 0 for x \u2208 Rd \\ supp(u). Then,\n\u2225u\u22252H2(\u2126) \u2264 \u2225u\u2225 2 H2(Rd) = \u222b Rd \u27e8\u03be\u27e94|u\u0302(\u03be)|2d\u03be\n= \u222b |\u03be|\u2265c \u27e8\u03be\u27e94|u\u0302(\u03be)|2d\u03be + \u222b |\u03be|<c \u27e8\u03be\u27e94|u\u0302(\u03be)|2d\u03be =: I + II\nfor some c > 0 to be fixed later. For the high frequencies,\nI = \u222b |\u03be|\u2265c \u27e8\u03be\u27e94|u\u0302(\u03be)|2d\u03be = \u222b |\u03be|\u2265c \u27e8\u03be\u27e94 |\u03be|4 |\u2206\u0302u|2d\u03be = \u222b |\u03be|\u2265c \u27e8\u03be\u27e94 |\u03be|4 |F\u0302 (\u03be)|2d\u03be \u2264 \u27e8c\u27e9 4 |c|4 \u2225F\u22252L2(\u2126).\nCombining the Poincare\u0301 inequality and the weak form of the Laplace equation, we have\n\u2225u\u22252L2(\u2126) \u2264 \u03bb \u22121 1 \u2225\u2207u\u22252L2(\u2126) \u2264 \u03bb \u22121 1 \u2225F\u2225L2(\u2126)\u2225u\u2225L2(\u2126),\nand therefore, for the low frequencies,\nII \u2264 \u27e8c\u27e94\u2225u\u22252L2(\u2126) \u2264 \u27e8c\u27e9 4\u03bb\u221221 \u2225F\u22252L2(\u2126).\nCombining I and II, \u2225u\u2225H2(\u2126) \u2264 \u27e8c\u27e92(|c|\u22124 + \u03bb\u221221 ) 1 2 \u2225F\u2225L2(\u2126).\nNoting that c 7\u2192 \u27e8c\u27e92(|c|\u22124 + \u03bb\u221221 ) 1 2 has a global minimum at c = \u03bb 1 3 1 , we fix that value of c to obtain\n\u2225u\u2225H2(\u2126) \u2264 C1\u2225F\u2225L2(\u2126) where C1 := \u03bb\u221211 \u27e8\u03bb 1 3 1 \u27e93. (A.8)\nNow we assume u \u2208 H10 (\u2126) is the unique weak solution of\n\u2212\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03f5\u2207u) + \u03ba2u = f in \u2126. (A.9)\nSetting F := f \u2212 \u03ba2u \u2208 L2(\u2126), the product rule applied to Equation (A.9) yields\n\u2212\u2206u = \u03f5(x)\u22121(F +\u2207\u03f5 \u00b7 \u2207u).\nNoting that |\u03f5(x)| \u2265 |Re(\u03f5(x))| \u2265 Re(\u03f5(x)) \u2265 \u03b8, an immediate application of Equation (A.8) yields\n\u2225u\u2225H2(\u2126) \u2264 C1 \u03b8 (\u2225F\u2225L2(\u2126) + \u2225\u2207\u03f5 \u00b7 \u2207u\u2225L2(\u2126)). (A.10)\nTaking the real part of the weak form of Equation (A.9), we have\u222b \u2126 Re(\u03f5(x))|\u2207u|2 + \u222b \u2126 Re(\u03ba2)|u|2 = Re \u222b \u2126 fu.\nRecalling that Re(\u03ba2(x)) \u2265 \u2212\u00b5 for all x \u2208 \u2126 and the uniform ellipticity,\n\u03b8 \u222b \u2126 |\u2207u|2 + \u222b \u2126 Re(\u03ba2)|u|2 \u2264 \u2225f\u2225L2(\u2126)\u2225u\u2225L2(\u2126).

Instead, we closely follow the argument of [31, Section 6.3, Theorem 4] to obtain an estimate on CH . An emphasis here is that we keep track of the implicit constants.\nLemma A.7. Let L be as given in Equation (3.5).

Since \u03bb1 \u2265 \u03c0 2 d2\u2126 for convex \u2126, the RHS of Equations (A.7) and (A.15) converges to C(\u2126)\u03b8 as d\u2126 \u2192 0. Remark A.2. Since the estimate of Equation (A.15) depends on the number of finitely many open balls covering \u2126, the geometry of \u2202\u2126 plays a big role in the computation of N(\u2126). This will be pursued in future research.\nProof. Let V \u22d0 W \u22d0 \u2126. Let \u03b6 \u2208 C\u221ec (\u2126) such that 0 \u2264 \u03b6 \u2264 1 and \u03b6 = 1 on V , and supp(\u03b6) \u2286 W .

            "text": "In this appendix, we demonstrate that the assumption made in proving the existence of unique solutions were reasonable. In particular, if hypotheses 2 and 3 or the smallness assumptions on (f, g) \u2208 L2(\u2126)\u00d7H3/2(\u2126) are violated, then there can be multiple small solutions of the nPBE.\nLet us first examine what can happen if we allow hypotheses 2 and 3 to be violated. For the case where \u03f5 and \u03ba2 are scalar-valued and f and g set to zero functions, eq. (1.1) simplifies to\n\u2212\u2206u+ (\u03b7 \u2212 \u03bb1) sinh(u) = 0 in \u2126, u = 0 on \u2202\u2126,\n(B.1)\nwhere \u03b7 = \u03bb1 + \u03ba 2/\u03f5 \u2208 R. The function u \u2261 0 is always a trivial solution for the above PDE. For Equation (B.1), Hypotheses 2 and 3 are satisfied if and only if \u03b7 is greater than zero. The parameter \u03b7 is the smallest eigenvalue of the \u2212\u2206+(\u03b7\u2212\u03bb1), so this linear operator is non-invertible when \u03b7 = 0. The following result proved by Crandall and Rabinowitz in [26] can be used to show that the zero solution undergoes a bifurcation at \u03b7 = 0:\nTheorem B.1. Let X and Y be Banach spaces and assume\n(i) F \u2208 C2(X \u00d7 R, Y ),\n(ii) F (0, \u03b7) = 0 for all \u03b7 \u2208 R,\n(iii) dimN(DxF (0, 0)) = codimR(DxF (0, 0)) = 1, and\n(iv) D2x\u03b7F (0, 0)v\u03020 /\u2208 R(DxF (0, 0)) where v\u03020 \u0338= 0 is in N(DxF (0, 0)).\nThen there is a nontrivial continuously differentiable curve\n{(x(s), \u03b7(s)) | s \u2208 (\u2212\u03b4, \u03b4)} (B.2)\nsuch that (x(0), \u03b7(0)) = (0, 0), x\u2032(0) = v\u03020 and\nF (x(s), \u03b7(s)) = 0 for s \u2208 (\u2212\u03b4, \u03b4). (B.3)\nHere Dx and D\u03b7 represent the Frechet derivatives of F with respect to the X and R components, respectively. Note that D\u03b7F (x, \u03b7) \u2208 L(R, Y ), the set of linear operators from R into Y . An element A \u2208 L(R, Y ) can be uniquely associated with an element y \u2208 Y by setting y \u2208 A(1). Thus D2x\u03b7F (x, \u03b7) can be associated with an element of L(X,Y ), which is how the map D2x\u03b7F (0, 0) is being viewed in Item (iv). Applying Theorem B.1 gives the existence of non-unique small solutions.\nTheorem B.2. Let c > 0. Then there is \u03b7\u2217 < 0 such that for any \u03b7 \u2208 [\u03b7\u2217, 0) there is a non-trivial solution u of Equation (B.1) such that \u2225u\u2225H2 < c.\nProof. Define F : H2(\u2126) \u2229H10 (\u2126)\u00d7 R \u2192 L2(\u2126) as\nF (u, \u03b7) = \u2212\u2206u+ (\u03b7 \u2212 \u03bb1) sinh(u). (B.4)\nAssumptions (i) and (ii) are clearly satisfied. Note that DuF (0, 0) = \u2212\u2206\u2212\u03bb1. Thus assumption (iii) follows from the Fredholm properties of \u2212\u2206 and from the fact that \u03bb1 is the principal eigenvalue of \u2212\u2206. Let v\u03020 be be the eigenfunction corresponding to \u03bb1. Then assumption (iv) states that D 2 u\u03b7F (0, 0)v\u03020 = v\u03020 /\u2208 R(DuF (0, 0)). This should hold since if v\u03020 \u2208 R(DuF (0, 0)), then there is a generalized eigenfunction for \u03bb1 which contradicts the simplicity of \u03bb1. Hence, we can apply Theorem B.1 to F (u, \u03b7) = 0 to get a nontrivial continuously differentiable curve {(u(s), \u03b7(s)) | s \u2208 (\u2212\u03b4, \u03b4)}. (B.5) with (u(0), \u03b7(0)) = (0, 0).\nOne can also compute derivatives of \u03b7(s) (see [51, \u00a71.6] for details) to get that \u03b7\u2032(0) = 0 and \u03b7\u2032\u2032(0) < 0. Thus it is possible to choose \u03b4 small enough so that \u03b7(s) is strictly decreasing on s \u2208 [0, \u03b4). Given c > 0, we can find s\u2217 > 0 small enough to get \u2225u(s)\u2225H2 \u2264 c for all s \u2208 (0, s\u2217] by the continuity of the curve. Since s 7\u2192 \u03b7(s) is strictly decreasing on (0, s\u2217], we can invert this mapping to get \u03b7 7\u2192 s(\u03b7) for \u03b7 \u2208 [\u03b7\u2217, 0) where \u03b7\u2217 = \u03b7(s\u2217). Therefore, for each \u03b7 \u2208 [\u03b7\u2217, 0) we have a solution of Equation (B.1), given by u = u(s(\u03b7)) such that \u2225u\u2225H2 < c.\nRemark B.1. There are two non-trivial solutions to Equation (B.1) for \u03b7 < 0 sufficiently close to zero: one for s > 0 and one for s < 0. In fact, from the oddness of sinh(u), if u is a solution of Equation (B.1) then so is \u2212u.\nComparing Theorem B.2 with Proposition 3.2 shows that uniqueness cannot be guaranteed without Hypotheses 2 and 3.\nWe may also lose uniqueness of solutions if (f, g) become too large. We construct an example of nPBE that admits multiple solutions. By construction, this family of nPBEs fails to satisfy the invertibility condition given in Hypothesis 3 and/or the smallness assumption on (f, g) \u2208 L2(\u2126) \u00d7 H 32 (\u2202\u2126). In particular, this example is consistent with the well-known uniqueness result of [55].\nWe wish to obtain a radial solution u(x) = u(|x|) = y(r), where r = |x| \u2265 0, to Equation (1.1) where \u03f5 = 1 for simplicity and \u03ba = i\u03ba\u0303 \u2208 iR on domain \u2126 = B(0, R) \u2286 Rd for R > 0, d \u2265 1 and f(x) = \u03bb \u2208 R, g(x) = sinh\u22121( \u03bb\u03ba\u03032 ). In the polar coordinate, our example reduces to an ODE\nry\u2032\u2032 + (d\u2212 1)y\u2032 + \u03ba\u03032r sinh y = r\u03bb, r \u2208 (0, R) y(R) = sinh\u22121 ( \u03bb \u03ba\u03032 ) .\n(B.6)\nwhere it is clear that the constant function r 7\u2192 sinh\u22121 (\n\u03bb \u03ba\u03032\n) is a trivial solution. Since Equation (B.6) is\nsymmetric under r 7\u2192 \u2212r, we may consider \u03bb \u2265 0. It is also clear that (f, g) \u2208 L2(\u2126) \u00d7 H 32 (\u2202\u2126) can be taken as large as possible (in norm) by taking \u03bb arbitrarily large. Furthermore, we note that Hypothesis 3 is violated when R\u226b 1 depending on \u03ba\u0303. To elaborate, fix \u03ba\u0303 > 0. If Hypothesis 3 holds, then \u03ba\u03032 \u2264 \u00b5 < \u03bb1 = CBR2 . Hence if R > CB\u03ba\u0303 , then Hypothesis 3 cannot hold.\nProposition B.1. Let d \u2265 1, \u03ba\u0303 > 0, \u03bb \u2265 0. Then, there exists a non-trivial solution to Equation (B.6) with R > CB\u03ba\u0303 .\nReducing Equation (B.6) into a first-order ODE by introducing w = y\u2032, we obtain( y w )\u2032 = F (r, y, w) := ( w\n\u2212\u03ba\u03032 sinh y \u2212 (d\u2212 1)wr + \u03bb\n) . (B.7)\nFor d = 1, Equation (B.7) admits an autonomous Hamiltonian vector field where the Hamiltonian is given by\nH(y, w) = w2\n2 + \u03ba\u03032(cosh y \u2212 1)\u2212 \u03bby.\nSince the level sets ofH are a collection of closed one-dimensional curves, all solutions are global and periodic. The inner curves have lower values of H than the outer curves. Indeed, the global minimum of H occurs at P = (sinh\u22121 (\n\u03bb \u03ba\u03032 ) , 0) where H(P ) \u2264 0 with the equality if and only if \u03bb = 0. Hence for each initial datum(\nc 0\n) , there exists a unique solution y to Equation (B.6) where y(R) = 0 for infinitely many R > 0. We\ninclude a phase portrait where the solutions lie on the curves of constant Hamiltonian.\nFor d \u2265 2, the vector field corresponding to Equation (B.7) is non-autonomous, and F in Equation (B.7) is not well-defined at r = 0 where our initial data are given. We regularize the ODE so that the regularized vector field is continuous (in r) near r = 0, and show that the limiting solution satisfies Equation (B.6). We solve an ODE that is slightly more general than Equation (B.6). We use the notations of Proposition B.1.\nLemma B.1. For every A \u2265 0 and c \u2208 R, there exists R > CB\u03ba\u0303 and y \u2208 C \u221e loc((0,\u221e);R) such that y satisfies\nry\u2032\u2032 +Ay\u2032 + \u03ba\u03032r sinh y = r\u03bb, r \u2208 (0,\u221e),\nlim r\u21920+ y(r) = c, lim r\u21920+ y\u2032(0+) = 0, y(R) = sinh\u22121 ( \u03bb \u03ba\u03032 ) .\n(B.8)\nProof of Proposition B.1. Set A = d\u2212 1.\nProof of Lemma B.1. The A = 0 case is equal to that when d = 1, and therefore assume A > 0. Moreover, assume c \u0338= sinh\u22121 (\n\u03bb \u03ba\u03032\n) since it yields a trivial solution. For \u03f5 > 0, consider the perturbed ODE:\n(r + \u03f5)y\u2032\u2032\u03f5 +Ay \u2032 \u03f5 + \u03ba\u0303 2(r + \u03f5) sinh y\u03f5 = (r + \u03f5)\u03bb, r \u2208 [\u2212 \u03f5\n2 ,\u221e),\ny\u03f5(0) = c, y \u2032 \u03f5(0) = 0,\n(B.9)\nwhich, after setting w\u03f5 = y \u2032 \u03f5, reduces to(\ny\u03f5 w\u03f5\n)\u2032 = F\u03f5(r, y\u03f5, w\u03f5) := ( w\u03f5\n\u2212\u03ba\u03032 sinh y\u03f5 \u2212 Aw\u03f5r+\u03f5 \u2212 \u03bb\n) .\nSince F\u03f5 is smooth in r near r = 0 and locally Lipschitz in (y, w), there exists T\u03f5 \u2208 (0, \u03f52 ) and y\u03f5 \u2208 C([\u2212T\u03f5, T\u03f5];R) \u2229 C\u221eloc((\u2212T\u03f5, T\u03f5);R) such that y\u03f5 is a unique solution to Equation (B.9). In the maximal\ninterval of existence, ( y\u03f5 w\u03f5 ) satisfies\nd\ndr H(y\u03f5(r), w\u03f5(r)) = w\u03f5(r)(y\n\u2032\u2032 \u03f5 (r) + \u03ba\u0303 2 sinh y\u03f5(r)\u2212 \u03bb) = \u2212 Aw\u03f5(r)\n2\nr + \u03f5 \u2264 0, r \u2265 \u2212 \u03f5 2\nand therefore the forward orbit of ( y\u03f5 w\u03f5 ) is bounded in the compact subset {(y, w) \u2208 R2 : H(y, w) \u2264 H(c, 0)}\non which F\u03f5 is Lipschitz. Hence, ( y\u03f5 w\u03f5 ) can be uniquely extended globally in forward time, obeying the estimate H(y\u03f5(r), w\u03f5(r)) \u2264 H(c, 0), r \u2265 0. (B.10)\nThis global bound on |y\u03f5|+ |w\u03f5| yields an existence of a limit function, since for r1, r2 \u2265 0, |y\u03f5(r2)\u2212 y\u03f5(r1)| = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u222b r2\nr1\nw\u03f5(\u03c1)d\u03c1 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 C|r2 \u2212 r1|, where C > 0 is independent of \u03f5 > 0. An immediate application of Arzela\u0300-Ascoli Theorem implies that there exists a subsequence \u03f5k > 0 that tends to zero (from the right) and y \u2208 Cloc([0,\u221e);R) such that y\u03f5k \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nk\u21920 y\nin the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets; in particular, y(0) = c. Let T > 0. Since {w\u03f5k} is uniformly bounded in L2((0, T );R) due to Equation (B.10), there exists a subsequence of {\u03f5k} and w \u2208 L2((0, T );R) such that, possibly after relabelling the subsequence, w\u03f5k \u21c0 w in L2((0, T );R). This weak convergence of derivatives and the uniform convergence y\u03f5k \u2192 y on [0, T ] implies that w is the weak derivative of y. Furthermore, we have ((r + \u03f5k)y \u2032 \u03f5k )\u2032(r) = (1 \u2212 A)y\u2032\u03f5k \u2212 \u03ba\u0303\n2(r + \u03f5k) sinh y\u03f5k(r)+(r+\u03f5k)\u03bb from Equation (B.9) where the right-hand side is uniformly bounded in L\n2((0, T );R). Another application of the Arzela\u0300-Ascoli Theorem implies that there exists Y \u2208 C([0, T ];R) such that (\u00b7 + \u03f5k)y\u2032\u03f5k \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192k\u2192\u221e Y in C([0, T ];R), possibly after relabelling the subsequence, and follows y \u2032 \u03f5k \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 k\u2192\u221e Y r in C([\u03b4, T ];R) for every \u03b4 > 0, and therefore we identify w(r) with a continuous function Y (r)r on (0, T ); indeed, w = y\u2032 classically on (0, T ). Yet another application of Equation (B.10) and the triangle inequality |w(r)| \u2264 |w(r)\u2212 y\u2032\u03f5k(r)|+ |y \u2032 \u03f5k (r)| yields the bound |w(r)| \u2264M for some M > 0 on (0, T ).\nSince y\u03f5k is a classical solution to Equation (B.9), it is also a weak solution. Writing Equation (B.9) in the weak form, integrating by parts, and taking k \u2192 \u221e, we obtain ry\u2032\u2032 +Ay\u2032 + \u03ba\u03032r sinh y = r\u03bb on (0, T ) in the weak sense where the distributional derivative y\u2032\u2032 can be identified with a continuous function on (0, T ) using the equation above. Using Equation (B.9) and the uniform convergence of y\u03f5k and its derivative as k \u2192 \u221e, we conclude (r + \u03f5k)y\u2032\u2032\u03f5k \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192k\u2192\u221e \u2212(Ay \u2032 + \u03ba\u03032r sinh y) + r\u03bb = ry\u2032\u2032 uniformly on [\u03b4, T ], and therefore y\u2032\u2032\u03f5k \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192k\u2192\u221e y \u2032\u2032 in C([\u03b4, T ];R) for every \u03b4 > 0. We have shown that y(j)\u03f5k \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 k\u2192\u221e y(j) uniformly on compact subsets of (0, T ) for j = 0, 1, 2. Taking k \u2192 \u221e from Equation (B.9), we conclude that y satisfies the desired ODE pointwise on (0, T ). Since the vector field F is smooth on (0, T ) \u00d7 R2 where T > 0 was arbitrary, we conclude y \u2208 C\u221eloc((0,\u221e);R)).\nSince y\u2032\u2032 is continuous on (0, T ) and y\u2032\u03f5k \u21c0 y \u2032 in L2((0, T );R) as k \u2192 \u221e, for every \u03d5 \u2208 C\u221ec ((0, T );R),\u222b T\n0 y\u2032\u2032\u03f5k\u03d5 = \u2212 \u222b T 0 y\u2032\u03f5k\u03d5 \u2032 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 k\u2192\u221e \u2212 \u222b T 0 y\u2032\u03d5\u2032 = \u222b T 0 y\u2032\u2032\u03d5.\nTherefore, {y\u2032\u2032\u03f5k} is uniformly bounded in L 2((0, T );R), and another application of the Arzela\u0300-Ascoli Theorem shows that there exists a convergent subsequence of {y\u2032\u03f5k} in C([0, T ];R). Since we showed y \u2032 \u03f5k C([\u03b4,T ];R)\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 k\u2192\u221e y\u2032 for every \u03b4 > 0, we conclude that \u03b4 could be taken to be zero. In particular, y\u2032(0) = lim k\u2192\u221e y\u2032\u03f5k(0) = 0.\nFinally from the phase portrait analysis, the solution (y(r), w(r)) exhibits an oscillatory behavior in R2; however, note that in the non-autonomous case, the solution curve does not lie in any curves of constant Hamiltonian due to the y\u2032 term. Since every closed curve of constant Hamiltonian contains the global\nminimum (sinh\u22121 (\n\u03bb \u03ba\u03032 ) , 0), there exists {Rn}\u221en=1 such that 0 < Rn < Rn+1, Rn \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 n\u2192\u221e \u221e such that y(Rn) =\n0.\nRemark B.2. For d = 3, Equation (B.6) with \u03ba\u0303 = 1 can be understood as a nonlinear zeroth-order spherical Bessel equation. To be more precise, a (linear) zeroth-order spherical Bessel ODE is given by\nry\u2032\u2032 + 2y\u2032 + ry = 0.\nThe two linearly independent solutions are given by\nj0(r) = sin r\nr ; y0(r) = \u2212\ncos r\nr .\nWe give plots comparing the linear and nonlinear solutions for d = 3.\nRemark B.3. Intuitively, this non-uniqueness stems from the non-coercivity of the nonlinear operator Tu := \u2212\u03f5\u2206u + \u03ba2 sinhu when \u03f5, \u03ba do not satisfy \u03f5, \u03ba > 0. Indeed, our choice of nonlinearity is beyond the scope of those discussed in [64] that studies the uniqueness of radial solution to \u2206u + f(u) = 0 when f \u2032(0) < 0. As a simple example, let \u03f5 = 1, \u03ba = i and consider the linearized equation u\u2032\u2032 + u = 0 in x \u2208 (0, \u03c0) with the boundary condition u(0) = u(\u03c0) = 0. Then, we have an uncountable family of solutions {A sinx}A\u2208R.\nHowever, it turns out that uniqueness can be salvaged if we drop the lower orders terms of sinh(u). We state a result whose proof, based on the Derrick-Pohozaev identity, is easily adapted from that of [31, Section 9.4, Theorem 1]; compare this to Proposition B.1.\nLet d \u2265 3 and N0 > d+2d\u22122 be an odd integer. Suppose u \u2208 C 2(\u2126) is a classical solution to\n\u2212\u2206u = \u2211\nN\u2265N0, N odd\nuN N ! , x \u2208 \u2126\nu = 0, x \u2208 \u2202\u2126,\nwhere \u2126 is a star-shaped domain containing 0 \u2208 Rd with \u2202\u2126 \u2208 C1. Then, u = 0 in \u2126. Acknowledgements: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant No. 1736392.
