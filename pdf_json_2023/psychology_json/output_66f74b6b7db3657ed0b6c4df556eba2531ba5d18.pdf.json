    "abstractText": "Ricca assays allow the direct introduction of compounds extracted from plants or the organisms that attack them into the leaf vasculature. Using chromatographic fractionation of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaf extracts, we found glutamate was the most active low mass elicitor of membrane depolarization. However, other known elicitors of membrane depolarization are generated in the wound response. These include unstable aglycones generated by glucosinolate (GSL) breakdown. None of the aglycone-derived GSL-breakdown products, including nitriles and isothiocyanates, that we tested using Ricca assays triggered electrical activity. Instead, we found that glutathione and the GSL-derived compound sulforaphane glutathione triggered membrane depolarizations. These findings identify a potential link between GSL breakdown and glutathione in the generation of membrane depolarizing signals. Noting that the chromatographic fractionation of plant extracts can dilute or exchange ions, we found that Cl caused glutamate receptor-like3.3-dependent membrane depolarizations. In summary, we show that, in addition to glutamate, glutathione derivatives as well as chloride ions will need to be considered as potential elicitors of wound-response membrane potential change. Finally, by introducing aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae) extracts or the flagellin-derived peptide flg22 into the leaf vasculature we extend the use of Ricca assays for the exploration of insect/plant and bacteria/plant interactions.",

            "text": "A method pioneered by Ricca (1916) allows the introduction of molecules into the living vasculature of plants. With this technique, compounds of interest can be transferred from a damaged leaf into the veins of distant, intact leaves. The first step in the procedure involves burning or scalding petioles in order to kill all cells surrounding xylem vessels. The damaged part of the petiole can then be cut into any solution from which water and solutes are carried through the xylem transpiration stream in a basipetal direction toward the stem. The fluid stream then enters undamaged distal leaves and moves acropetally toward their tips. Based on\nthe use of this method, Ricca (1916) postulated that \u201chormones\u201d derived from wounded parts of Mimosa species moved through the xylem to trigger distal leaf movements. The subsequent association of leaf movements and electrical signals in Mimosa (e.g. Umrath 1928) eventually led to the term \u201cRicca\u2019s factors\u201d being generalized to molecules that activate electrical signaling in wounded plants (Sambeek and Pickard 1976). Over the years, a number of unsuccessful attempts were made to identify components of leaf extracts that triggered membrane depolarizations in plants (e.g. Cheeseman and Pickard 1977; Sibaoka 1997). Recently, Ricca assays were employed in renewed attempts\nReceived August 17, 2023. Accepted October 12, 2023. Advance access publication October 31, 2023 Open Access \u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.

A rapid membrane depolarization phase is followed by a long-duration irregular repolarization phase typically lasting approximately 2 min and occasionally displaying repetitive depolarization spikes (Mousavi et al. 2013). The ability to propagate SWPs from a wounded leaf to a distal leaf depends on clade 3 glutamate receptor-like (GLR) proteins, and in particular on GLR3.3 and GLR3.6 (Mousavi et al. 2013). The use of the Ricca assay combined with genetic approaches revealed that two \u03b2-thioglucoside glucohydrolases (TGG1 and TGG2) were the principal Ricca\u2019s factors in adult-phase Arabidopsis (Gao et al. 2023). Mutants lacking TGG1 and TGG2, or plants lacking aliphatic glucosinolates (GSLs) which are substrates for these enzymes, failed to produce wild-type (WT)-like SWPs. A mechanism was proposed in which TGG-catalyzed GSL breakdown generated short-lived aglycone (thiohydroximate-Osulfonate) elicitors of membrane depolarization. However, in tgg1 tgg2 double mutants, further activities remained. These other membrane depolarizing factors likely include glutamate (Shao et al. 2020; Gao et al. 2023) a molecule strongly implicated in wound-response calcium signaling (Toyota et al. 2018; Bellandi et al. 2022; Grenzi et al. 2023). In principle, stable membrane depolarizing elicitors such as glutamate could be extracted, fractionated, assayed, and purified from plants. However, such standard approaches are not without their limitations. For example, some active factors might be short-lived and therefore difficult to purify\u2014as is the case for unstable aglucones derived from GSL breakdown (Mocniak et al. 2020). During extraction, other active compounds might react with cell components that they would not encounter in undamaged tissues. Additionally, ions with biological activities may be diluted-out during fractionation of plant extracts. Finally, many plant\u2013insect and plant pathogen interactions could liberate or generate compounds capable of affecting plant membrane potentials. We took each of these possibilities into account in a search for further elicitors of membrane depolarization in A. thaliana. In addition to employing electrophysiology assay-driven fractionation of Arabidopsis leaf extracts we investigated nonplant-derived substances for their ability to trigger membrane potential changes when introduced into the xylem."

            "text": "Introduction of molecules into the leaf vasculature For Ricca assays, a pipette tip fitted onto a 5 mL syringe (Supplemental Figure S1A) was used to drip boiling water (approximately 0.5 mL) onto the leaf 8 petiole of a 5-wk-old plant. A toothpick channeled excess water into the soil (Supplemental Figure S1B). While room temperature water did not elicit electrical activity in leaf 8 or leaf 13, the scalding procedure triggered repetitive depolarizations in leaf 8\n(Supplemental Figure S1C). This procedure caused a low level of induction of JASMONATE-ZIM-DOMAIN 10 (JAZ10) transcripts (which indicate jasmonate-response gene expression) in distal leaf 13. Levels of JAZ10 transcripts induced by scalding in leaf 13 were about 4-fold higher than those of untreated plants (Supplemental Figure S1D). Fluorescein was used to trace molecular movement from leaf 8 to distal leaf 13. Fluorescein transport from leaf 8 to leaf 13 occurred to a similar extent and at a similar velocity when the healthy leaf 8 petiole was severed, or when the equivalent region of a scalded petiole was cut (Supplemental Fig. S2, Supplemental Movies 1 and 2). This indicated that scalding and cutting through dead tissue did not disrupt fluid movement compared to cutting through living petiole tissue.\nUsing this procedure, we investigated how quickly biologically active substances needed to be introduced into the scalded petiole in order for the assay to function. For these experiments, fresh leaf extract (FLE) was prepared. Using the experimental set-up shown in Supplemental Figure S3A, the scalded region of the leaf 8 petiole was either cut in FLE immediately or cut into a buffer then FLE was added into the buffer at various times after cutting. For over 25 min after first cutting into a buffer, FLE introduction into the buffer elicited electrical signals in the \u201clocal\u201d scalded leaf. However, in distal leaf 13 we noted a progressive decay in electrical signal duration in the first 25 min after cutting the scalded region. In this distal leaf, signal amplitudes were almost invariably in the region of \u221275 to \u221230 mV or else they were near zero (Supplemental Figure S3B). In the 1,500 s after cutting the scalded region the apparent velocity of the electrical signal through the distal leaf 13 remained in the region of 5 to 14 (average 10) cm/min (Supplemental Figure S3C). In conclusion, FLE can be introduced into the scalded petiole and electrical signals excited in this same leaf 8 petiole for at least 30 min after initial incubation in a buffer. By contrast, we found that the cut petiole must be treated with an elicitor solution within no more than 3 min of cutting in order to trigger long-duration depolarizations in the distal leaf 13. In all subsequent experiments, the scalded region of leaf 8 was cut immediately into test solutions.\nFractionation of leaf extracts prior to Ricca assays Genetic studies of electrical signaling in Arabidopsis leaves distal to wounds have shown that the \u03b2-thioglucoside glucohydrolases, TGG1 and TGG2, are the most active elicitors of membrane depolarization in leaves distal to wounds (Gao et al. 2023). To identify further components of leaf extracts which could trigger membrane depolarization, FLE was fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Fractions eluted from the SEC column were then tested for their activity in the Ricca assay. Two activity peaks were identified. Fractions 11 and 12 in Fig. 1A corresponded to previously characterized TGG1 and TGG2 proteins (Gao et al. 2023). Fractions 20 and 21 were enriched in low molecular weight compounds. Fraction 20 triggered membrane depolarizations of exceptionally long\n2 | PLANT PHYSIOLOGY 2023: 00; 1\u201313 Gao et al.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of this fraction identified six principal components: glycerol, glucose, citrate, malate, glutamate, and 4-aminobutyrate (Fig. 1B). Despite several overlaps with other signals, the annotated protons of glutamic acid were recovered in fraction 20 (Supplemental Fig. S4). In pure form, each of the six compounds detected in fraction 20 was assayed for its ability to trigger membrane depolarization in the Ricca assay. Only glutamate was active in these tests (Fig. 1C). The activity of glutamate in the assay was concentrationdependent. At 1 mM concentration glutamate provoked a rapid, spike-like depolarization. However, when its concentration was increased to 10 mM, glutamate triggered a spike depolarization followed by a prolonged depolarization phase reminiscent of a slow wave potential (Fig. 1D). The activity of the other 19 canonical amino acids were compared to that of glutamate in the Ricca assay. In some assays, cysteine (Cys) provoked short, spike-like depolarizations (Supplemental Fig. S5). Previously, L-Cys was found to be more active than Glu in triggering cytosolic Ca2+ transients in Arabidopsis roots (Alfieri et al. 2020). Together, these findings drew our attention to other S-containing molecules and among which were GSL breakdown products.\nEffects of sulfur-containing compounds on membrane potentials The breakdown of aliphatic GSLs by TGG1 and TGG2 is essential for slow wave potential signaling in Arabidopsis (Gao et al. 2023). GSL breakdown can be envisaged as a twostep process. Firstly, hydrolysis of the glucose moiety produces unstable aglucones which have short half-lives (Mocniak et al. 2020). These compounds can then decay producing more stable derivatives including isothiocyanates and nitriles (Wittstock and Burow 2010). In the current model, aglucones produced by the breakdown of aliphatic GSLs directly or indirectly trigger wound-response membrane depolarization (Gao et al. 2023). We tested a variety of other GSL breakdown products for their activities in the Ricca assay. However, none of the 16 compounds tested, which ranged from isothiocyanates to nitriles, etc. was active at concentrations shown in Fig. 2A. The electrophilic isothiocyanate sulforaphane was inactive in the assay (Fig. 2A). However, isothiocyanates can be coupled to the glutamatecontaining molecule glutathione (GSH; Yagishita et al. 2019). This led us to investigate the activity of GSH and related compounds.\nUsing the Ricca assay, reduced GSH and oxidized GSSH were, like FLE (Fig. 2B), active in triggering membrane depolarizations in Arabidopsis (Fig. 2, C and D). When we tested the laboratory reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) we found that it could trigger spike-like depolarization of membranes in distal leaf 13 (Fig. 2E). However, the architecture of the DTT-triggered signal differed to the architectures of the GSH- and GSSH-induced signals which displayed more prolonged repolarization phases. Knowing that GSL-derived aglycones act directly or indirectly in SWP signaling (Gao\net al. 2023), and having detected membrane depolarization activities with GSH, we decided to test the potential biological activity of sulforaphane glutathione. This conjugate is one of several metabolites of the aliphatic GSL glucoraphanin. Sulforaphane glutathione at a concentration of 20 mM elicited repetitive spike depolarizations (Fig. 2F).\nSlow wave potential signals activate the synthesis of defense-inducing jasmonates such as jasmonoyl-isoleucine (Mousavi et al. 2013). When introduced into the vasculature, do GSH and its derivates cause activation of the jasmonate pathway? To test this GSH or GSSH (each at 5 mM) or sulforaphane glutathione (20 mM) were introduced into the leaf 8 petiole. One hour later leaf 13 was sampled and JAZ10 transcript levels were measured in that leaf. Each GSH derivative induced JAZ10 transcript accumulation (Supplemental Fig. S6). Next, we considered GSH mutants. Since loss-of-function GSH mutants are embryo-lethal (e.g. Cairns et al. 2006), we tested SWP generation in the phytoalexin-deficient 2-1 (pad2-1) mutant which contains only 22% of WT GSH levels. Under our pest-free culture conditions, pad2-1 grows similarly to the WT (Parisy et al. 2007). Leaf 8 of pad2-1 was wounded and SWPs were measured in distal leaf 13. The SWPs were slightly affected in the mutant plants (Supplemental Fig. S7).\nEffect of ions on membrane depolarization Many ions which are abundant in plant cells could, in theory, be diluted or exchanged during chromatographic fractionation. K+ has signaling functions and is of central importance in plant electrophysiology (Britto and Kronzucker 2008). When we tested 200 mM KCl in the Ricca assay we found that it triggered membrane depolarizations which resembled the SWPs but lacked the apparent hyperpolarization which precedes the depolarization phase of the SWP (Fig. 3A). Expecting membrane depolarization to be due to K+, we tested NaCl and CsCl at the same concentration as a control. In both cases NaCl and CsCl provoked membrane depolarizations (Fig. 3, B and C). To rule out osmotic effects, sorbitol was tested in the assay. This compound did not induce membrane depolarization (Fig. 3D). However, two potassium salts, K2SO4, and to a lesser extent KNO3, stimulated the production of short, spike-like depolarizations (Fig. 3E). The finding that the Cl\u2212 anion could trigger membrane depolarization was unexpected and prompted us to investigate whether mutations in two of the principal GLR genes involved in the SWP signaling (GLR3.3 and GLR3.6) affected the plants ability to respond to this ion. In these experiments glr3.3, glr3.6, and glr3.3 glr3.6 mutants were treated with 500 mM CsCl, in each case using Ricca assays to feed the salt into leaf 8. Interestingly, CsCl introduced into leaf 8 failed to trigger electrical activity in leaf 13 of the glr3.3 single mutant or the glr3.3 glr3.6 double mutant, whereas electrical activity in the glr3.6 single mutant resembled that elicited in the WT (Fig. 3F). Having found that the Cl\u2212 anion can trigger membrane depolarizations we investigated SWP production in several CHLORIDE CHANNEL and ALUMINUM-ACTIVATED MALATE TRANSPORTER mutants (Supplemental Table S1). None of the plants we tested strongly affected SWP production.\now nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /plphys/advance-article/doi/10.1093/plphys/kiad584/7334395 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 11 January 2024\nMembrane depolarizing activities from a herbivorous insect and a bacterial pathogen Elicitors derived from pathogens have long been known to affect membrane potentials (e.g. Pelissier et al. 1986) and the same is true of some insect-derived factors (e.g. Maffei et al. 2004; Camoni et al. 2018). Among effector-secreting\ninsects (Tanaka and Heil 2021) are vein-feeding hemipterans. To test whether Ricca assays could be used to study insectderived factors we produced and tested an extract from the phloem-feeding aphid Brevicoryne brassicae. This extract triggered long-duration depolarizations which are compared to those elicited by FLE in Fig. 4, A and B. Having found\nA\nB C\nE F\nD\nFigure 2.

Remarkably, glr3.3 and glr3.6 mutants differentially affected membrane depolarizations triggered by AE. Specifically, glr3.3 strongly reduced the duration of the depolarization and had a less pronounced effect on signal amplitude (Fig. 4C). By contrast, the glr3.6 single mutant abolished all responses to the extract. Electrical signal production in response to the AE was also abolished in the glr3.3 glr3.6 double mutant.\nFinally, we tested the bacterial flagellin-derived pathogenassociated molecular pattern (PAMP) flg22. flg22 triggers immune responses in plants (DeFalco and Zipfel 2021). When introduced into the leaf 8 xylem of the WT, flg22 elicited spike-like depolarizations in distal leaf 13 very different from those induced by FLE (Fig. 5). In addition, flg22 induced a gradual reduction in membrane potential. This gradual weakening in membrane potential was not affected substantially in the glr3.3 glr3.6 double mutant background. Additionally, the double mutant did not affect the major\ndepolarization detected but attenuated secondary spiking activity elicited by flg22."

However, tgg mutants did not eliminate all electrical activity in leaves distal to wounds and different compounds are likely to contribute to membrane depolarization in the wounded leaf itself. Glutamate is the best candidate for such a molecule, but are there further compounds that need consideration? In their search for plant-derived elicitors of leaf movement or membrane depolarization, some researchers have used boiled or solvent-extracted plant extracts (e.g. Fitting 1936; Sambeek and Pickard 1976). We avoided these treatments and analyzed FLEs. At the outset we took two potential weaknesses of assay-based fractionation into consideration.\nA B C\nD E F\nFigure 3.

Secondly, mixing of reactive cellular components (even in the absence of enzyme activity) could, in theory, remove some active molecular species and generate others. Our findings reveal that, both Cl\u2212 anions and the cellular protectant glutathione (GSH/GSSH) will need to be investigated for their potential contributions to wound-induced membrane depolarizations.\nHighly active low mass fractions contain glutamate Previous work identified high mass (TGG protein) elicitors of membrane depolarization in Arabidopsis leaves distal to wounds (Gao et al. 2023). In this work, we fractionated leaf extracts using the SEC and focused on lower mass elicitors. When eluted fractions containing low molecular weight compounds were assayed for their ability to provoke membrane potential changes the most active fraction contained a mixture of organic acids including glutamate (Fig. 1B). Glutamate proved to be the only compound in the fraction which triggered membrane depolarization, and this was strongly concentration-dependent (Fig. 1, C and D). These results are consistent with early work on the leaf movementprovoking activity of glutamate in Mimosa pudica (Fitting 1936; Schildknecht et al. 1978), with more recent work on the ability of glutamate to induce increases in cytosolic Ca2+ levels in Arabidopsis (Toyota et al. 2018; Bellandi et al. 2022; Gao et al. 2023; Grenzi et al. 2023) as well as with the effects of exogenous glutamate on membrane potentials in this plant (Shao et al. 2020; Gao et al. 2023). In the Ricca assay, 1 mM glutamate triggered spike depolarizations in leaf 13\nwhereas 5 or 10 mM glutamate triggered long-duration depolarizations resembling slow wave potentials (Fig. 1D). The concentration-dependence of glutamate activity is particularly interesting and, at high concentrations, glutamate may be excitotoxic to plant cells (Gao and Farmer 2023). Consistent with the studies of Bellandi et al. (2022) and Grenzi et al. (2023), we speculate that glutamate might act as a membrane depolarization elicitor via gating of GLR3.3. However, other amino acids can act as GLR3.3 agonists to depolarize membranes in roots (Qi et al. 2006). To test their effects on leaf membrane potentials we, therefore, fed each canonical amino acid into the vasculature.\nS-containing molecules can act as modulators of membrane potential In addition to the effects of glutamate, we noted that cysteine had weak activity in the Ricca assay where it triggered spike-like depolarizations of short-duration (Supplemental Fig. S5). Cysteine, like glutamate, is a ligand for GLR3.3 (Alfieri et al. 2020). We tested whether other S-containing molecules could influence membrane potentials when introduced into the vasculature. GSH is an abundant endogenous elicitor which can enhance defense gene expression in bean cell suspension cultures (Wingate et al. 1988). Interestingly, both GSH- and GSSH-induced depolarizations resembled SWPs in that they triggered rapid depolarizations followed by longer repolarization phases (Fig. 2, C and D). DTT also induced membrane depolarization (Fig. 2E). To test whether this might be a general property of S-containing molecules, we chose to study the compounds most closely related to\nA B C\nFigure 4. The activity of aphid extract.

GSL breakdown produces a diversity of byproducts (Halkier and Gershenzon 2006; Wittstock and Burow 2010). Although we only tested a range of these molecules and did not investigate, for example, the potential activities of epithionitriles, none of the 16 GSL-related compounds tested, including nitriles and electrophilic isothiocyanates, triggered membrane potential changes (Fig. 2A). The compounds tested included benzyl isothiocyanate which suppresses proton pump phosphorylation and inhibits stomatal opening (Aihara et al. 2023). In our experiments, the failure to find effects of a variety of commercially available GSL breakdown products suggests that only sulfur (S) atoms in specific molecular contexts (e.g. linked to glutamate-containing molecules) may affect membrane potential when introduced into the vasculature.\nSulforaphane glutathione is a GSL-derived molecule with known activities in defense induction (Andersson et al. 2015). At high concentration (20 mM) this compound triggered\nrepetitive spike depolarizations (Fig. 2F) which were reminiscent of electrical signals occasionally observed in wounded plants (Mousavi et al. 2013). In our study, pulsed spikes were sometimes observed with GSH or GSSH treatments, and they differed from the single spike depolarization typical of DTT treatment. We speculate that the repetitive spike depolarizations triggered by sulforaphane glutathione may arise through a different mechanism than that responsible for the protracted SWP depolarization phase.\nWe note that when concentrations as low as 20 mM glucoraphanin (the parent GSL from which sulforaphane glutathione is derived) were supplied to plants in the presence of TGG1 they triggered SWP-like membrane depolarizations (Gao et al. 2023). The three-orders-of-magnitude difference in activity between glucoraphanin and sulforaphane glutathione suggests that the aglucone-derived regulator(s) of membrane depolarization in leaves distal to wounds is/are likely to have a far higher activity than sulforaphane glutathione. The possibility that GSL-derived aglucones react directly\nFigure 5. The activity of a bacterial PAMP.

The xylem of plants in the Brassicales contains GSH (Mendoza-C\u00f3zatl et al. 2008) and it will be worthwhile investigating the possibility that aglucones derived from GSL breakdown in the xylem react with GSH or GSSH to form biologically active conjugates. Wound-response membrane depolarization causes activation of the jasmonate pathway (Mousavi et al. 2013) and GSH has been implicated previously in the control of basal jasmonate pathway activity (Han et al. 2013). When introduced into the vasculature, GSH, GSSH, and sulforaphane glutathione all stimulated JAZ10 expression (Supplemental Fig. S6). However, the pad2-1 mutant which has lower-than-WT GSH levels did not reduce SWP durations or amplitudes. Under our culture conditions, pad2-1 produces enough GSH for healthy growth and seed production. We, therefore, do not rule out roles of GSH in electrical signaling which might be revealed in mutants with further reduced GSH levels. Additionally, we do not rule out possible effects on cellular redox potentials being linked to depolarization."

Therefore, prior to analyses of leaf extracts we investigated the effects of high concentrations of salts on membrane potentials in leaves. As expected, KCl (200 mM) triggered membrane depolarization (Fig. 3A) and we assumed initially that this was due to K+, an abundant cation important for the regulation of membrane potential (Britto and Kronzucker 2008; Shabala 2017) and which plays roles in long distance signaling (e.g. Wegner and De Boer 1997; Cuin et al. 2018). Unexpectedly, we found instead that Cl\u2212 triggered membrane depolarization (Fig. 3, B and C). Consistent with this, and even at very high concentrations (500 mM), KNO3 and K2SO4 failed to trigger the long-duration depolarizations (Fig. 3E) that we observed with 200 mM KCl, NaCl or CsCl treatments. This was not due to ionic strength (I) since the KNO3 and K2SO4 solutions used had higher I (0.5 and 1.5, respectively) than the KCl or NaCl solutions used (I = 0.2). Remarkably, Cl\u2212 induced depolarization was GLR3.3-dependent (Fig. 3F). H+-ATPase inactivation in response to wounding has been proposed (Julien et al. 1991). How Cl\u2212 fed into the vasculature causes membrane depolarization is unknown and the few anion channels we tested failed to affect SWP production. Finding that Cl\u2212, an anion with important regulatory properties (Valdivieso and Santa-Coloma 2019), can trigger membrane depolarization highlights the difficulty of using genetic approaches for quantitating the relative contributions of key ions, amino acids such as glutamate, and also GSH, all of which are essential cell components."

            "heading": "Conclusions",
            "text": "The main advantage of using Ricca assays to probe biological activities is that substances enter a leaf that has not been\ndamaged. Furthermore, these substances travel along a natural transport route, the transpiration stream. This delivery method has advantages since the vascular bundle may block the entry of certain substances infiltrated into leaves. Ricca assays, therefore, have great potential in studying vascular physiology and pathophysiology. A potential disadvantage is that substances fed into the vasculature will be diluted in the transpiration stream, as they move to distal leaves. This means that assessing the effective concentration of a substance at its site of action in vivo will be difficult. A further consideration is the site of action of molecules or ions introduced in the vasculature. Whether they act on xylem contact cells or, as has been evoked recently (Gao et al. 2023), may travel into the phloem region prior to activating GLR-dependent electrical signaling is unknown.\nIn addition to studying the effects of plant-derived factors, we found that insect- or pathogen-derived molecules can be introduced into the leaf vasculature using Ricca assays. To demonstrate this, we used extracts from phloem-feeding aphids as well as the bacterial PAMP flg22. Results from these experiments were of particular interest and showed that the effects of nonplant-derived substances on membrane potentials can be studied in the WT and mutant plants. Moreover, the procedures we used could now be combined with fractionation and employed, for example, to identify effectors from insects that feed on the vasculature. Equally interesting would be to employ Ricca assays to investigate the biology of effectors produced by vascular pathogens some of which cause serious yield losses (e.g. Burbank and Roper 2021). We, therefore, broaden the use of the term \u201cRicca\u2019s factors\u201d to membrane potentialchanging substances that are naturally released into the xylem from plants themselves or from the organisms that attack them. Given their versatility, Ricca assays could also find further uses in the introduction of hormones into veins; this may be of use to study vascular differentiation.\nFinally, it might even be possible to use Ricca assays to introduce small quantities of molecules which can be replicated in cells surrounding xylem vessels. This could include, for example, the genomes of viral pathogens, or certain other nucleic acids."
