 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the systematic review:

1. Conduct large-scale studies with standardized methodologies to evaluate different ML architectures for lung cancer detection. This could help identify the optimal algorithms and techniques.

2. Develop hybrid AI systems that combine machine learning and deep learning to leverage their complementary strengths. This may improve accuracy compared to using either approach alone.

3. Evaluate the real-world clinical utility and workflow integration of AI lung cancer diagnostics to assess practical benefits versus expert radiologists. 

4. Design optimal training datasets and data augmentation techniques to train AI models effectively without requiring extremely large datasets. This could make AI more accessible.

5. Explore AI for multi-class classification of lung cancer subtypes, not just binary detection. This could aid precision diagnosis and treatment decisions.
