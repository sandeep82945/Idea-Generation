 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Explore the use of different nozzle designs and jet shapes (e.g. flat jets) for improving optical excitation uniformity and enabling new types of experiments like transient grating spectroscopy.

2. Develop nozzles and jet delivery systems tailored for serial femtosecond crystallography experiments to reduce sample consumption and improve hit rates.

3. Perform pump-probe experiments combining X-ray emission spectroscopy and wide-angle X-ray scattering to get a more complete picture of solute and solvent structural dynamics.

4. Extend the multi-color X-ray emission spectroscopy capabilities to more dilute biological samples and multi-metallic centers.

5. Use the high photon energies available at EuXFEL to reach atomic resolution in time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography experiments.
