    "abstractText": "The type-I two-Higgs-doublet model in the inverted Higgs scenario can retain the theoretical stability all the way up to the Planck scale. The Planck-scale cutoff \u039bPlanck cut directly impacts the mass spectra such that all the extra Higgs boson masses should be light below about 160 GeV. However, the observation of the light masses of new Higgs bosons does not indicate the high-cutoff scale because a low-cutoff scale can also accommodate the light masses. Over the viable parameter points that satisfy the theoretical requirements and the experimental constraints, we show that the trilinear Higgs couplings for low \u039bcut are entirely different from those for the Planck-scale cutoff. The most sensitive coupling to the cutoff scale is from the h-h-h vertex, where h is the lighter CP-even Higgs boson at a mass below 125 GeV. The gluon fusion processes of gg \u2192 hh and gg \u2192 AA are insensitive to the cutoff scale, yielding a small variation of the production cross sections, O\u00f01\u00de fb, according to \u039bcut. The smoking-gun signature is from the triple Higgs production of qq\u03040 \u2192 W \u2192 H hh, which solely depends on the h-h-h vertex. The cross section for \u039bcut 1\u20444 1 TeV is about 10 times larger than that for the Planck-scale cutoff. Since the decay modes of H \u2192 W h=W A and h=A \u2192 bb are dominant, the process yields the 6b\u00fe l\u03bd final state, which enjoys an almost background-free environment. Consequently, the precision measurement of pp \u2192 H hh can probe the cutoff scale of the model.",

The Planck-scale cutoff \u039bPlanckcut directly impacts the mass spectra such that all the extra Higgs boson masses should be light below about 160 GeV. However, the observation of the light masses of new Higgs bosons does not indicate the high-cutoff scale because a low-cutoff scale can also accommodate the light masses. Over the viable parameter points that satisfy the theoretical requirements and the experimental constraints, we show that the trilinear Higgs couplings for low \u039bcut are entirely different from those for the Planck-scale cutoff. The most sensitive coupling to the cutoff scale is from the h-h-h vertex, where h is the lighter CP-even Higgs boson at a mass below 125 GeV. The gluon fusion processes of gg \u2192 hh and gg \u2192 AA are insensitive to the cutoff scale, yielding a small variation of the production cross sections, O\u00f01\u00de fb, according to \u039bcut. The smoking-gun signature is from the triple Higgs production of qq\u03040 \u2192 W \u2192 H hh, which solely depends on the h-h-h vertex. The cross section for \u039bcut \u00bc 1 TeV is about 103 times larger than that for the Planck-scale cutoff. Since the decay modes of H \u2192 W h=W A and h=A \u2192 bb are dominant, the process yields the 6b\u00fe l\u03bd final state, which enjoys an almost background-free environment. Consequently, the precision measurement of pp \u2192 H hh can probe the cutoff scale of the model.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.107.015025\nI. INTRODUCTION\nUp to today, all of the measurements of the production cross sections of the standard model (SM) particles at high-energy colliders are in good agreement with the SM predictions [1], including the observed Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV [2\u201316]. Nevertheless, our minds are rarely in satisfaction with the SM, because of the unsolved questions, such as the naturalness problem, baryogenesis, nonzero neutrino masses, fermion mass hierarchy, the origin of CP violation in the quark sector, and the identity of dark matter. We continue our journey in the quest for the ultimate theory. A crucial question is whether the ultimate theory shall\nreveal its whole structure at one energy scale. The answer is much more likely to be no when looking back on the SM,\nthe only reliable guideline at this moment. We witnessed the emergence of SM particles in stages. The same phenomena could happen in the ultimate theory. In other words, the final theory may consist of multilevel submodels. The first-stage new physics (NP) model1 describes our Universe up to a particular energy scale \u039bcut and then hands over its role to the second-stage NP model. \u039bcut could be as high as the Planck scale or as low as 10 TeV. Then can an observable distinguish the high and low \u039bcut? This is the driving question in our paper. For the first-stage NP model, we consider the two-Higgs-\ndoublet model (2HDM) since many fundamental questions are closely related to the Higgs sector. The 2HDM provides the answers to some questions. For example, the first-order electroweak phase transition in the 2HDM can explain the baryogenesis [17\u201321]. However, the model cannot address all the fundamental questions, which makes it a suitable candidate for the first-stage NP model. Then the next question is how to calculate the energy\nscale at which the second-stage NP model appears.

Or it coexists with the SM at the electroweak scale so that the new particles have the intermediate masses.\nPHYSICAL REVIEW D 107, 015025 (2023)\n2470-0010=2023=107(1)=015025(17) 015025-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nway is to calculate the cutoff scale of the 2HDM. Even though the theoretical requirements (unitarity, perturbativity, and vacuum stability) are satisfied at the electroweak scale, they can be broken at a higher energy scale \u039bcut because the parameters evolve under renormalization group equations (RGEs) [22\u201328]. Since it implies the advent of the second-stage NP model, we call \u039bcut the cutoff scale of the model. In the literature, the high-energy scale behavior of the\n2HDM has been extensively studied. Most studies are focused on the impact of high \u039bcut on the extra Higgs boson masses [26,29\u201337]. However, observing the scalar mass spectrum that high \u039bcut predicts does not guarantee that \u039bcut is high. In this paper, we focus on the type I of the 2HDM in the inverted Higgs scenario where the heavier CP-even scalar H is the observed Higgs boson [38\u201340]. The model can accommodate the cutoff scale all the way up to the Planck scale [35]. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the allowed points of \u00f0MA;MH \u00de for \u039bcut \u00bc 1018 GeV (red points) are overlapped with those for \u039bcut \u00bc 10 TeV (gray points). Two points in cyan, one for \u039bcut \u00bc 10 TeV and the other for \u039bcut \u00bc 1018 GeV, have the same MA and MH . We need an alternative observable to disentangle the high- and low-cutoff scales. The measurement of tan \u03b2, the ratio of two vacuum expectation values of two-Higgsdoublet fields, is tricky in type I when tan \u03b2 is large. In type I, all the Yukawa couplings of the beyond the SM (BSM) Higgs bosons are inversely proportional to tan \u03b2 in the Higgs alignment limit. So, the main production channels of gg \u2192 A=h and t \u2192 H b are suppressed by large tan \u03b2. In addition, the branching ratios of all the fermionic decay modes are insensitive to tan \u03b2 in type I. We need alternative observables to probe the cutoff scale.\nWe will show that the trilinear Higgs couplings can play the role. In particular, the value of the h-h-h vertex \u03bbhhh is highly sensitive to the cutoff scale. To probe the trilinear Higgs couplings at the LHC, we will study the di-Higgs processes of gg \u2192 hh and gg \u2192 AA and the tri-Higgs processes of pp \u2192 H hh. The gluon fusion production of gg \u2192 h=H \u2192 hh=AA is to be shown insensitive to \u039bcut because of the destructive interference between the h and H contributions. We will show that the tri-Higgs process pp \u2192 H hh is the best to measure the cutoff scale because the signal rate is solely dependent on \u03bbhhh, yielding \u03c3\u039bcut\u00bc1 TeV=\u03c3\u039bcut\u00bc1018 GeV \u223c 10\n3. Considering the dominant decay modes ofH and h, we will suggest for the first time the 6b\u00fe l\u03bd final state as an efficient discriminator between the high- and low-cutoff scales. These are our new contributions. The paper is organized in the following way. In Sec. II,\nwe briefly review the type I in the inverted scenario. Section III describes the methods of the parameter scanning and the calculation of \u039bcut. The characteristics of the viable parameter points with high \u039bcut are also presented. In Sec. IV, we calculate the correlation between the trilinear Higgs couplings and the cutoff scale. Section V deals with the LHC phenomenology. Based on the study of the branching ratios of the extra Higgs bosons, we will suggest efficient observables to distinguish the high- and low-cutoff scales. Finally, we conclude in Sec. VI."

We allow softly broken Z2 symmetry since it does not affect the RGE of the dimensionless quartic couplings [44]: the hard Z2 breaking in the Yukawa sector causes too fast growth of the scalar quartic couplings in the RG running [32].

Relations of mass eigenstates with weak eigenstates in terms of two mixing angles of \u03b1 and \u03b2 are referred to Ref. [45].

Two scenarios exist for the limit, the normal scenario where hSM \u00bc h (i.e., s\u03b2\u2212\u03b1 \u00bc 1) and the inverted scenario where hSM \u00bc H (i.e., c\u03b2\u2212\u03b1 \u00bc 1).

We use the public code 2HDMC v1.8.0 [62]. For the perturbativity, 2HDMC requires that the magnitudes of all the quartic couplings among physical Higgs bosons be less than 4\u03c0. However, 2HDMC does not check whether our vacuum is the global minimum of the potential. We demand the tree-level vacuum stability condition of [61]\nm212\u00f0m211 \u2212 k2m222\u00de\u00f0t\u03b2 \u2212 k\u00de > 0; \u00f012\u00de\nwhere k \u00bc \u00f0\u03bb1=\u03bb2\u00de1=4. The tree-level conditions have been known to be more than sufficient up to very high scales in the Higgs alignment limit [30,63]. (ii) Peskin-Takeuchi oblique parameters [64]: The oblique parameters of S, T, and U in the 2HDM [65\u201367] should satisfy the current best-fit results at 95% C.L.

(iii) Flavor-changing neutral currents: We demand that\nthe most recent observables from B physics be satisfied at 95% C.L. [69\u201371]. We adopt the results of Ref. [69].\n(iv) Higgs precision data: We use the public code HiggsSignals v2.6.2 [72] to check the consistency with the Higgs precision data. Based on the \u03c72 value for 111 Higgs observables [73\u201380] with five parameters, we require that the p value be larger than 0.05.\n(v) Direct search bounds: We demand that the model prediction to the cross sections of the direct search modes for new scalar bosons at the LEP, Tevatron, and LHC should be less than 95% C.L. upper bound on the observed cross sections. The open code HiggsBounds v5.10.2 [81] is used.\nBrief comments on the recent collider detector at Fermilab (CDF) measurement of the W boson mass [82],\nmCDFW \u00bc 80.4335 0.0094 GeV, are in order here. If we accept mCDFW , the oblique parameters change into SCDF \u00bc 0.15 0.08 and TCDF \u00bc 0.27 0.06 with U \u00bc 0 [83]. Although mCDFW has important implications on the 2HDM [35,36,83\u201396], our main conclusion on the role of trilinear Higgs couplings in disentangling the high- and low-cutoff scales does not change. Therefore, we focus on the oblique parameters without the CDF mW measurement. Over the parameter points that pass the above con-\nstraints, we evolve the following parameters via the RGE, by using the public code 2HDME [32,97]:\ng1;2;3; \u03bb1;\u2026;5; \u03be h;H;A f ; m11; m12; m 2 22; v1;2:\n\u00f014\u00de\nWe include the mixing effects of two scalar doublet fields (with equal quantum numbers) on v1 and v2, which bring about the RG running of t\u03b2. The top quark pole mass scale, mpolet \u00bc 173.4 GeV, is used to match the 2HDM to the SM. The boundary conditions at mpolet are referred to Ref. [32]. The \u03b2 functions of the gauge, Yukawa, and quartic couplings at one-loop level are presented in the Appendix. Since the difference between the one- and two-loop RG running is not large,2 we take the one-loop RGE to efficiently cover all the parameter points. Now let us describe how we obtained the cutoff scale \u039bcut. For each parameter point, we perform the RGE evolution up to the next high-energy scale3 and check three conditions: tree-level unitarity, perturbativity, and vacuum stability.4 If all three are satisfied, we increase the energy scale into the next step. If any condition is violated, we stop the running and record the energy scale as \u039bcut. We find that the Landau pole appears at a higher scale than \u039bcut. We additionally require that the cutoff scale should be larger than 1 TeV. In what follows, the \u201cviable parameter points\u201d denote the parameter points that satisfy the aforementioned constraints and \u039bcut > 1 TeV. Strong correlations exist between the cutoff scale and the\nmodel parameters. In Fig. 2, we present the viable parameter points over the plane of \u00f0MA;MH \u00de in the left panel and \u00f0mh; t\u03b2\u00de in the right panel. The color code denotes the cutoff scale \u039bcut. We sorted the parameter points according to \u039bcut and stacked them in order of \u039bcut, the points with low \u039bcut underneath and those with high \u039bcut on top.\n2For randomly selected parameter points, we compared \u039bcut at one-loop level with \u039bcut at two-loop level. The difference is O\u00f010\u00de%.\n3To cover from the electroweak scale to the Planck scale, we take a uniform step in log\u00f0Q\u00de.\n4Note that 2HDME uses the perturbativity condition of j\u03bb1;\u2026;5j < 4\u03c0 and the tree-level vacuum stability conditions in Refs. [55,98].\n015025-4\nThe overlap is due to the projection of five-dimensional parameter space in Eq. (5) on a two-dimensional subspace. Several remarkable features are shown in Fig. 2. First, the\nviable parameter points are pretty limited even with the weak condition of \u039bcut > 1 TeV. The upper bounds on MA and MH exist as MA;MH \u2272 430 GeV, to which the condition of \u039bcut > 1 TeV plays a critical role. The Peskin-Takeuchi oblique parameter T is satisfied ifMH \u223cMA orMH \u223cmh, which explains two branches in the left panel of Fig. 2. The lower branch corresponds toMH \u223cmh, which puts the upper bound on the charged Higgs boson mass. For the intermediate mass range of MA;MH \u2272 200 GeV, there is no particular correlation between MA and MH . However, meaningful correlations appear outside the box with MA;MH \u2272 200 GeV. If MH \u2273 200 GeV (belonging to the upper branch), MH \u2243MA. If MH \u2272 200 GeV and\nMA \u2273 200 GeV (belonging to the lower branch), MH \u223c 100 GeV. The lighter CP-even Higgs boson mass mh (right panel of Fig. 2) is heavier than half the observed Higgs boson mass due to the strong constraint from the exotic Higgs boson decay of H \u2192 hh. For t\u03b2, most values in the scanning are permitted. Although the density of the allowed t\u03b2 in the scatter plot is lower for larger t\u03b2, we cannot conclude that large t\u03b2 is disfavored: nature chooses just one parameter point. The second remarkable feature of Fig. 2 is that sub-\nstantial parameter points in the inverted type I remain stable all the way up to the Planck scale. Let us investigate the characteristics of the parameter points with the high-cutoff scale. In Fig. 3, we show MA versus mh (left panel) and t\u03b2 versus M2 (right panel) after imposing \u039bcut > 1018 GeV. The color code in the left (right) panel denotes MH (mh).\n015025-5\nIt is clearly seen that the high-cutoff scale requires light masses of the extra Higgs bosons like MA;MH \u2272 160 GeV. We observe that the charged Higgs boson is lighter than the top quark for the Planck-scale cutoff. However, the lower bounds of MA \u2273 10 GeV, mh \u2273 62.5 GeV, andMH \u2273 80 GeV do not change by imposing \u039bcut > 1018 GeV. Similarly, the Planck-scale cutoff does not affect the values of t\u03b2, as shown in the right panel of Fig. 3. The values of M2 are also limited even with \u039bcut > 1 TeV. Only the positive values ofM2 are permitted because negative M2 enhances \u03bb1 through the terms proportional to t2\u03b2. Large \u03bb1 at the electroweak scale quickly evolves into an unacceptably large value, which endangers the global minimum condition of the vacuum [59\u201361]. For \u039bcut > 1018 GeV, a unique correlation of M2 \u2243m2h appears, as shown in the right panel in Fig. 3. It is also ascribed to the t2\u03b2 terms in \u03bb1. The condition of M\n2 \u2243m2h suppresses the t2\u03b2 terms and thus helps to retain the stability of the scalar potential. Although the high-cutoff scale demands light masses of\nthe extra Higgs bosons, the inverse is not true. All the mass spectra in the left panel of Fig. 3 also accommodate a lowcutoff scale; see Fig. 1. Even if we observe mh \u00bc MA \u00bc 100 GeV and MH \u00bc 140 GeV, for example, the mass spectrum alone cannot tell whether the cutoff scale is high or low. The reader may suggest to use t\u03b2 as a discriminator of the cutoff scale. However, measuring t\u03b2 in type I is challenging at the LHC, especially when t\u03b2 \u226b 1. The value of t\u03b2 governs the fermionic productions (from the top quark decay or gluon fusion via quark loops) and fermionic decays of the extra Higgs bosons. If t\u03b2 is large, the fermionic production of the extra Higgs bosons is highly suppressed because all the Yukawa couplings of the extra Higgs bosons are inversely proportional to t\u03b2 in type I. The bosonic productions such as qq\u0304 \u2192 Z \u2192 Ah and qq\u0304 \u2192 W \u2192 H h=A [37,99\u2013109] do not give information about t\u03b2. Moreover, the fermionic decay parts are\ninsensitive to t\u03b2 because of the same dependence of all the Yukawa couplings on t\u03b2. If we cannot measure the exact value of large t\u03b2, it is reasonable to include all the viable parameter points with t\u03b2 > 10 when pursuing a way to discriminate the high and low \u039bcut."

III. Let us turn to the trilinear Higgs couplings versus \u039bcut. In Fig. 4, we present \u03bb\u0302hhh (left panel), \u03bb\u0302Hhh (middle panel), and \u03bb\u0302HH\u00feH\u2212 (right panel) at the electroweak scale, as a function of \u039bcut: note that \u03bb\u0302hAA \u00bc \u03bb\u0302hH\u00feH\u2212 \u00bc \u03bb\u0302hhh=3. Here only the BP-2 results are shown because BP-1 and BP-3 yield similar results withO\u00f010\u00de% differences. Thevalue of t\u03b2 is shownvia the color code. It is impressive that the values of \u03bb\u0302hhh, \u03bb\u0302Hhh, and \u03bb\u0302HH\u00feH\u2212 for \u039bcut \u00bc 1018 GeV are not overlapped with those for \u039bcut \u2272 1017 GeV, although the allowed values for lower\u039bcut are considerably spread by the unfixed t\u03b2 andm212. The most sensitive dependence on \u039bcut is shown in \u03bb\u0302hhh, which ranges in \u00bd\u22120.09; 1.1 . Since \u03bb\u0302hhh \u00bc 0 is included, the\n015025-6\nchange of \u03bb\u0302hhh according to \u039bcut is huge. On the other hand, the variations of \u03bb\u0302Hhh and \u03bb\u0302HH\u00feH\u2212 are small within 10% \u223c 20%. In the left panel of Fig. 5, we present \u03bb\u0302HAA versus \u039bcut for\nBP-1, BP-2, and BP-3. Unlike \u03bb\u0302hhh, \u03bb\u0302Hhh, and \u03bb\u0302HH\u00feH\u2212 , the value of \u03bb\u0302HAA is sensitive to the benchmark point. For high \u039bcut, j\u03bb\u0302HAAj of BP-1 is about 25 times larger than that of BP-3. \u03bb\u0302HAA depends on MA and M2, not on t\u03b2. Since M2 \u2248m2h and mh \u223cm125 as shown in Fig. 3, the M2 contribution to \u03bb\u0302HAA is nearly canceled by the m125 contribution. So, the heavier MA is, the larger j\u03bb\u0302HAAj is. We observe a special \u039bcut in Fig. 4 and the right panel of Fig. 5. Around \u039bcut \u2243 1017 GeV, all the trilinear Higgs couplings are almost fixed. Even though we present only the results of BP-2 in Fig. 4, the same behavior is found in BP-1 and BP-3. The spread trilinear Higgs couplings are focused on a single cutoff point, which we call \u039bfocuscut . Since the allowed value of M2 plays a crucial role in under-\nstanding\u039bfocuscut , we showM\u00f0\u2261 ffiffiffiffiffiffi M2 p \u00de versus the cutoff scale\n\u039bcut for BP-2 in Fig. 6. The left panel presents the results of all the viable parameter points. It is clear to see that the parameter points with \u039bcut \u00bc \u039bfocuscut satisfy the condition of M2 \u00bc m2h. We found that the reverse holds true. If we allow small deviation like jM2 \u2212m2hj \u2264 10 GeV2 as in the right panel of Fig. 6, the cutoff scale converges to \u039bcut \u00bc \u039bfocuscut for t\u03b2 \u00bc 10 but ranges from 1012 GeV to the Planck scale for t\u03b2 \u00bc 50. Then why does the condition of M2 \u00bc m2h fix the trilinear Higgs coupling? It is because the condition removes the t\u03b2 dependence of the trilinear couplings, which is the main source for their variation. In addition,M2 \u00bc m2h removes the dangerous t2\u03b2 terms of \u03bb\u03021, which guarantees the high-energy scale of \u039bfocuscut . Now we discuss the other 2HDM scenarios. This paper\nconcentrates on the inverted type I in the Higgs alignment limit. Let us first consider a small deviation from the alignment. Since the Higgs precision prospect at the future muon collider associated with the HL-LHC and the Higgs factory at ffiffi s\np \u00bc 250 GeV is \u03b4\u03baW \u2243 0.11% [110], we consider two cases of js\u03b2\u2212\u03b1j \u00bc 0.05, 0.1. In Fig. 7, we present\n015025-7\n\u03bb\u0302hhh versus \u039bcut for js\u03b2\u2212\u03b1j \u00bc 0.05 (left panel) and js\u03b2\u2212\u03b1j \u00bc 0.1 (right panel). Here only BP-2 results are shown. For js\u03b2\u2212\u03b1j \u00bc 0.05, the behavior of \u03bb\u0302hhh about \u039bcut remains almost same as the alignment case. The values of \u03bb\u0302hhh for \u039bcut \u00bc 1018 GeV are not overlapped with those for \u039bcut \u2272 106 GeV. If we increase the deviation from the alignment into js\u03b2\u2212\u03b1j \u00bc 0.1, the band of \u03bb\u0302hhh widens. The values of \u03bb\u0302hhh for \u039bcut \u00bc 1018 GeV are mostly overlapped with the low-cutoff scale, except for \u039bcut \u2272 10 TeV. Finally, we discuss whether we have similar results for other types or the normal Higgs scenario where the lighter CP-even Higgs boson is the observed one. In the inverted Higgs scenario, type II and type Y are excluded by imposing the condition of \u039bcut > 1 TeV [35] because the constraint from b \u2192 s\u03b3, MH > 800 GeV [111], contradicts the required light masses of the BSMHiggs bosons. Type X in the inverted scenario can accommodate \u039bcut \u00bc 1018 GeV and shows similar behaviors of the trilinear Higgs couplings about the cutoff scales. In the normal scenario, all four types can retain the theoretical stability up to \u039bcut \u00bc 1018 GeV. The high-cutoff scale demands the almost exact mass degeneracy among the BSM Higgs boson masses, i.e., M \u00bc MA \u00bc MH \u00bc MH , but does not put any upper bounds on the masses. So, the question for the normal scenario is changed: how can we distinguish the high- and low-cutoff scales via observables if we observe a highly degenerate mass spectrum of the extra Higgs bosons? It is more challenging than in the inverted scenario due to the heavy masses and the soft decay products of the BSM Higgs bosons. Nevertheless, the similar behavior of \u03bb\u0302HHH about \u039bcut leaves a motivation for the phenomenological study in future colliders."

            "text": "For the LHC phenomenology, we first present the branching ratios of h (left panels), A (middle panels),\nand H (right panels) as a function of \u039bcut in Fig. 8. The results of BP-1, BP-2, and BP-3 are in the upper, middle, and lower panels, respectively. We include all the viable parameter points. The first noteworthy feature in Fig. 8 is that the dominant decay mode of the extra Higgs boson with the given mass spectra is insensitive to the cutoff scale, even though the two parameters of t\u03b2\u00f0> 10\u00de and m212 are not fixed. The decay of h depends on the hierarchy between mh and MA. When mh \u2264 MA as in BP-1 and BP-2, the leading (next-to-leading) decay mode is h \u2192 bb (h \u2192 \u03c4\u00fe\u03c4\u2212). However, if mh > MA as in BP-3, the dominant decay mode is h \u2192 AZ . The suppressed Yukawa couplings of h by large t\u03b2 enhance the bosonic decay modes if kinematically open. The decay of A is primarily determined by the hierarchy between MA and mh. For BP-2 and BP-3 with MA \u2264 mh, the pseudoscalar A dominantly decays into a pair of b quarks with Br\u00f0A \u2192 bb\u0304\u00de\u2273 0.73. The next-to-leading decay mode of A is into gg. The substantial Br\u00f0A \u2192 gg\u00de is attributed to the larger loop amplitudes of a pseudoscalar than those of a scalar for the spin-1=2 particle contributions [112]. The third one is A \u2192 \u03c4\u00fe\u03c4\u2212. If MA > mh as in BP-1, however, Br\u00f0A \u2192 hZ \u00de becomes the largest, which holds for the entire range of \u039bcut. The decay into bb\u0304 is mostly the next-to-leading mode.5\nThe charged Higgs boson mainly decays into hW and AW , for the three benchmark points. Once kinematically allowed, the bosonic decay modes are dominant: the H -W\u2213-h vertex is proportional to c\u03b2\u2212\u03b1\u00f0\u00bc 1\u00de; the H -W\u2213-A vertex is originated from the pure gauge interaction. In BP-3 with MH > MA and MH > mh, the branching ratios of the fermionic modes are below 1%. If eithermh orMA is beyond the kinematic threshold as in BP-1 and BP-2, the fermionic decay modes become\n5We caution the reader that the scattered points are overlapped except for the leading decay mode. For some parameter points, A \u2192 gg can be the next-to-leading mode.\n015025-8\nconsiderable. The leading fermionic decay mode depends on the charged Higgs bosons mass. For BP-1 whereMH is substantially lighter than the top quark mass, H \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd has the largest branching ratio among the fermionic decay modes, followed by H \u2192 cs. In BP-2 where MH is near to the top quark mass, H \u2192 t b becomes the leading fermionic mode, followed by H \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd. To probe the trilinear Higgs couplings at the LHC, we\nneed to consider multi-Higgs production mediated by Higgs bosons. The first important production channels are the di-Higgs processes, gg \u2192 H=h \u2192 hh=AA. The corresponding Feynman diagram6 is in the left panel of\nFig. 9. The contribution of H destructively interferes with that of h because the signs of \u03bb\u0302Hhh and \u03bb\u0302hhh are opposite to each other; see Fig. 4. In Fig. 10, we present as a function of \u039bcut the parton-level production cross sections for gg \u2192 hh (left panel) and gg \u2192 AA (right panel) at the 14 TeV LHC over the viable parameter points. All the three benchmark points in Eq. (15) are considered. The color code denotes t\u03b2. To calculate the parton-level cross sections, we first obtained the Universal FeynRules Output (UFO) [113] by using FeynRules [114]. Then we interfered the UFO file with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [115] and calculated the cross sections at the 14 TeV LHC with the NNPDF31_LO_AS_0118 parton distribution function set [116].\n6We omit the box diagrams from the top quark loop because two factors of 1=t\u03b2 suppress them.\n015025-9\nFor the production cross sections of gg \u2192 hh, the most crucial factor is mh. The lighter mh is, the larger \u03c3\u00f0gg \u2192 hh\u00de is. BP-1 yields the largest cross section. On the contrary, the production cross section of gg \u2192 AA is larger for heavier MA. The BP-1, which has the heaviest MA among the three benchmark points, has the largest cross section. It seems contradictory to the kinematic loss by the heavy MA. The main reason is that the dominant contribution to gg \u2192 AA is from H and thus \u03bb\u0302HAA determines the signal rate. The heavier MA is, the larger \u03bb\u0302HAA is; see Fig. 5. The dependence of \u03c3\u00f0gg \u2192 hh=AA\u00de on \u039bcut is not large enough to distinguish the high- and low-cutoff scales. Even the optimistic case, the process of gg \u2192 hh in BP-1 with t\u03b2 \u00bc 10, makes a few femtobarn difference in the cross sections between \u039bcut \u00bc 1 TeV and \u039bcut \u00bc 1018 GeV. It is too small to probe at the HL-LHC with the expected total luminosity of 3 ab\u22121. For larger t\u03b2 like 50, the di-Higgs production cross sections become more insensitive to \u039bcut. The weak dependence of \u03c3\u00f0gg \u2192 hh\u00de on \u039bcut is due to the dominant contribution from H and the destructive interference between the H and h contributions. In the BP-1 with t\u03b2 \u00bc 10 and \u039bcut \u00bc 1 TeV, for example, the cross section from H alone is \u03c3\u00f0gg \u2192 H \u2192 hh\u00de \u2243 36.5 fb, from h alone is\n\u03c3\u00f0gg \u2192 h \u2192 hh\u00de \u2243 1.1 fb, and from the interference \u03c3\u00f0gg \u2192 hh\u00deintf \u2243 \u221212.1 fb. The \u03bb\u0302Hhh controls the cross section, but its variation about \u039bcut is small. To single out only one trilinear Higgs coupling, we\nconsider triple Higgs productions at the LHC. Since the gluon fusion production of the tri-Higgs process through the top quark loop is suppressed by large t\u03b2, we concentrate on the tri-Higgs productions mediated by the gauge bosons. Through the Z boson, we have\nqq\u0304\u2192 Z \u2192 Ah \u2192 Ahh; qq\u0304\u2192 Z \u2192 A h\u2192 Ahh; \u00f017\u00de\nqq\u0304 \u2192 Z \u2192 Ah \u2192 AAA; \u00f018\u00de\nand through W,\nqq\u03040 \u2192 W \u2192 H h \u2192 H hh; \u00f019\u00de\nqq\u03040 \u2192 W \u2192 H h \u2192 H AA; \u00f020\u00de\nqq\u03040 \u2192 W \u2192 H A \u2192 H Ah: \u00f021\u00de\nAs a representative, we present the Feynman diagram of qq\u03040 \u2192 H hh in the right panel of Fig. 9. Since all the above processes in Eqs. (17)\u2013(21) have the same topology of the Feynman diagram, the production cross sections as a\n015025-10\nfunction of \u039bcut show almost the same behavior. In BP-2, for example, \u03c3\u00f0pp \u2192 Ahh\u00de=\u03c3\u00f0pp \u2192 H hh\u00de \u2243 0.9 holds for all \u039bcut. In Fig. 11, we present the parton-level production cross sections of qq\u03040 \u2192 H hh at the 14 TeV LHC for BP-1 (left panel), BP-2 (middle panel), and BP-3 (right panel). The color code denotes t\u03b2. The difference of the cross section according to \u039bcut is big enough to distinguish the high- and low-cutoff scales of the inverted type I. The ratio of the cross section for \u039bcut \u00bc 1 TeV to that for \u039bcut \u00bc 1018 GeV is more than about 103. This is the most remarkable result of our study. Measuring the signal rate of the triple Higgs production tells whether the cutoff scale is high or low. Finally, we discuss the discovery potential at the\nHL-LHC. Discriminating the high- and low-cutoff scales through gg \u2192 hh=AA requires the precision measurement on the cross section within \u223c1 fb. Let us roughly estimate the feasibility. The processes of gg \u2192 hh and gg \u2192 AA mainly yield 4b final states because A=h \u2192 bb is leading or next-to-leading. Resembling the di-Higgs process in the SM, they are challenging to observe for two reasons. First, the cross section itself is too small. The maximum cross section, which happens for \u039bcut \u00bc 1 TeV, reaches O\u00f010\u00de fb. It is to be compared with the SM leading-order result of \u03c3\u00f0gg \u2192 hSMhSM\u00deLO \u2243 17 fb at ffiffi s\np \u00bc 14 TeV [117]. Since the projected signal significance of the SM Higgs boson pair production at the HL-LHC with the total luminosity of 3 ab\u22121 is 3.0\u03c3, when the bbbb, bb\u03c4\u00fe\u03c4\u2212, and bb\u03b3\u03b3 decay channels are all combined [118], it is hard to observe gg \u2192 hh=AA. The second difficulty comes from the softer b jets than in the SM di-Higgs process. For gg \u2192 hh \u2192 4b, the lighter mh than 125 GeV yields soft b quarks. For gg \u2192 AA \u2192 4b, most of the viable parameter points in Fig. 3 have MA < 125 GeV, which generate soft b quarks. As the b tagging efficiency is reduced, the signal significance decreases as well. In summary, the di-Higgs process is not efficient to probe the cutoff scale.\nThe triple Higgs production of H hh has higher discovery potential. Since the charged Higgs boson mainly decays into W A=h in the three benchmark points, followed by h=A \u2192 bb, the final state is 6b\u00fe l\u03bd. This attractive channel has not been studied in the literature.7\nThe main backgrounds are\nt\u00fe t\u0304\u00fe l\u03bd \u2192 bjmisb jmisb \u00fe bjmisb jmisb \u00fe l\u03bd; t\u00fe t\u0304\u00fe jj \u2192 bl\u03bd\u00fe bjmisb jmisb \u00fe jmisb jmisb ; \u00f022\u00de\nwhere jmisb is the light jet (from u, d, s, c, and g) mistagged as a b quark jet. We calculated the parton-level cross sections of the backgrounds, with the b tagging and mistagging efficiencies of Pb\u2192b \u00bc 0.7, Pc\u2192b \u00bc 0.05, and Pj\u2192b \u00bc 0.01. We imposed the selection cuts of pbT > 20 GeV, plT > 10 GeV, j\u03b7l;jj < 2.5, EmissT > 20 GeV, and the separation \u0394Rii0 > 0.4. After the basic selection, the background cross section from tt\u0304jj is about 8.7 ab and from tt\u0304l\u03bd is about 3.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 ab. If we impose additional cuts on the invariant mass of two b jets like jmbb \u2212mhj < 15 GeV, the backgrounds are negligible. Despite the almost backgroundfree environment, the high\u039bcut yields too small signal rate of pp \u2192 H hh at the 14 TeV LHC. Exploring the cutoff scale in the inverted type I via the 6b\u00fe l\u03bd final state has a better chance in future high-energy colliders such as the Future Hadron-Hadron Circular Collider (FCC-hh) at CERN [121], the CEPC [122,123], and the muon collider [124\u2013126]. Particularly, we have high expectations for the muon collider with benchmark energies in the range of ffiffi s\np \u00bc 3\u201330 TeV and the integrated luminosity of L \u00bc 10\u00f0 ffiffisp =10 TeV\u00de2 ab\u22121.

            "text": "Beyond the studies on how high the cutoff scale of a new physics model can go up, we have pursued an efficient observable to distinguish the high- and low-cutoff scales. The type I in the 2HDM has been considered for the inverted scenario where the observed Higgs boson at a mass of 125 GeV is the heavier CP-even Higgs boson H. We have first obtained the still-available parameter points that satisfy the theoretical requirements, the experimental constraints, and the cutoff scale above 1 TeV. The viable parameter space at the electroweak scale is already limited such that MA;MH \u2272 430 GeV and mh \u2273 62.5 GeV. Through the calculation of the cutoff scale \u039bcut of each viable parameter point by using the RGE, we have shown that the inverted type I can retain the stability all the way up to the Planck scale. The condition of \u039bcut > 1018 GeV requires the light masses of the extra Higgs bosons like MA;MH \u2272 160 GeV. However, the light masses alone cannot guarantee the high-cutoff scale because the parameter points with light masses accommodate \u039bcut from 1 TeV to 1019 GeV. Targeting at the phenomenologically challenging case of t\u03b2 > 10, we have investigated the trilinear Higgs couplings versus\u039bcut. Although the values of all the trilinear couplings for \u039bcut \u00bc 1 TeV are different from those for \u039bcut \u00bc 1018 GeV, \u03bb\u0302hhh shows a large variation about \u039bcut, \u03bb\u0302hhh \u2208 \u00bd\u22120.09; 1.1 . Multi-Higgs boson productions at the LHC have been studied to probe the cutoff scale. The gluon fusion productions of the di-Higgs, gg \u2192 hh=AA, are not efficient to measure \u03bb\u0302hhh because the dominant contribution from H dilutes the h contribution. The most remarkable result is in the tri-Higgs process of pp \u2192 H hh mediated by the W boson. The signal cross section shows huge variation according to \u039bcut, like \u03c3\u039bcut\u00bc1 TeV= \u03c3\u039bcut\u00bc1018 GeV \u223c 10\n3. The precision measurement of pp \u2192 H hh can indeed distinguish the high- and low-cutoff scales of the model. Considering the dominant decay\nmodes of H \u2192 W A=h, h \u2192 bb, and A \u2192 bb, an efficient final state of pp \u2192 H hh is 6b\u00fe l\u03bd.
