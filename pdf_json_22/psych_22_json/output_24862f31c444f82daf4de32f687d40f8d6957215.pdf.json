    "abstractText": "Adaptive interpersonal functioning relies on the effectiveness of behavioral and neural systems involved in cognitive control. Whether different subcomponents of cognitive control and their neural representations are associated with distinctive interpersonal dispositions has yet to be determined. The present study investigated the relationships between prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation associated with two subcomponents of cognitive control and individual differences in interpersonally relevant traits and facets within the Five-Factor Model of personality. Undergraduate participants (n = 237) provided self-ratings of interpersonal traits and underwent functional near-infrared spectroscopy to measure activation in regions-of-interest linked to subcomponents of cognitive control: the right lateral PFC and its involvement in response selection and inhibition/ suppression (RS) during a go/no-go task, and the left lateral PFC associated with goal selection, updating, representation, and maintenance (GS) on a tower planning task. Multilevel models revealed that during both RS and GS, Neuroticism and Extraversion were associated with lower and higher levels of activation, respectively. Higher Agreeableness was related to lower activation during RS but also with greater activation during GS. More narrowly defined interpersonal facets subsumed within the broader trait domains were differentially associated with RSand GS-related neural responses. Taken together, these findings highlight potential avenues of future research to better understand the ways in which the neural processes that subserve cognitive control may underlie interpersonal dispositions.",

            "text": "The ability to optimally regulate our behavior is advantageous for survival. In particular, behavioral regulation is vital for succeeding in one\u2019s interpersonal milieu. A growing body of research supports the idea that an individual\u2019s overall ability to regulate cognition, affect, and behavior is linked to better interpersonal skills and outcomes across various contexts (Tangney et\u00a0al., 2004). Specifically, it appears that those who are better able to regulate their behavior enjoy favorable interpersonal consequences, such as healthier relationships (e.g., forming secure attachments, experiencing fewer issues relating to anger and relationship conflict) and stronger interpersonal skills (e.g., being better able to take others\u2019 perspectives and show empathy). Additionally, injury to brain regions that are thought to subserve behavioral regulation have been linked to reduced interpersonal competence and more interpersonal problems (Yeates et\u00a0al., 2004). Furthermore, psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders Highlights \u2022 Activation patterns for response- and goal-selection differed across interpersonal traits. \u2022 Variability was also\u00a0seen at the level of facets that constituted trait domains. \u2022 Some facets showed patterns of associations that were distinct from their traits. * Anthony C.

Such evidence supports a general relationship between an individual\u2019s effectiveness in regulating their behavior and their ability to succeed with regard to interpersonal functioning (i.e., better regulation is associated with more favorable interpersonal outcomes). To date, however, the precise nature by which nuances in our ability to regulate behavior might influence interpersonal functioning has yet to be fully elucidated.\nInterpersonal functioning as\u00a0conceptualized in\u00a0the\u00a0five factor model of\u00a0personality\nWhile interpersonal functioning can be assessed in a number of ways, personality science provides a useful framework for understanding and quantifying human behavior within the interpersonal context. Personality traits, commonly conceptualized as enduring patterns of behavioral dispositions, form a key conceptual anchor for our understanding of how we behave with others (Tellegen, 1991). Within this context, the Five-Factor Model (FFM) of personality has emerged as a widely accepted conceptual framework that has unified much of the contemporary research on how we engage with others, as well as our environments more generally (John et\u00a0al., 2008). Importantly, trait domains and their constituting facets within the FFM are useful tools for conceptualizing interpersonal functioning across both momentary (e.g., isolated interpersonal interactions) and longitudinal processes (e.g., attachment; Costa & McCrae, 2011). Therefore, trait domains and their facets within the FFM can help to meaningfully delineate how important constructs such as behavioral regulation may influence interpersonal functioning.\nKey distinctions should be noted with regard to how personality traits and facets may relate to interpersonal functioning in general. While certain trait domains are suggested to be intrinsically interpersonal, the contribution of other trait domains to interpersonal functioning may be context dependent. Specifically, trait Extraversion (E), Agreeableness (A), and Neuroticism (N) define dispositions that are inherently interpersonal in nature, and for the most part, capture the complete gamut of interpersonal functioning (Costa & McCrae, 2011; DeYoung et\u00a0al., 2013). Furthermore, it has been suggested that N represents a general risk factor for interpersonal dysfunction, which in turn may be expressed as a function of E and A. On the other hand, Conscientiousness (C) and Openness to experience (O) also may be relevant to how we engage with others, albeit indirectly depending on the context (Costa & McCrae, 2011; Jensen-Campbell & Malcolm, 2007; McCrae, 1996). More specifically, these\ntraits may shape factors, such as how openly one engages in interactions or how reliable one is with interpersonal commitments. Similarly, as per their conceptualization (McCrae & Costa, 2010), some personality facets\u2014the more narrowly defined personality traits that fall below the broader domains\u2014also appear to be inherently interpersonal, whereas others may only relate to interpersonal functioning in specific contexts. A detailed grouping of trait domains and facets within the FFM based on their relationship to interpersonal functioning can be found in Table\u00a01. Unfortunately, despite decades of research that has advanced our understanding of these conceptual targets of interpersonal functioning, we know little about how they may be associated with one\u2019s ability to regulate behavior, specifically from a neurocognitive perspective. Two important questions arise in this regard: Is cognitive control related to interpersonally relevant trait domains and the corresponding facets, and are these associations within trait domains similar or different across the underlying facets?"

            "heading": "Defining cognitive control",
            "text": "It is important to recognize that the notion of regulating behavior to achieve desirable outcomes has been conceptualized in numerous ways across various theoretical and experimental frameworks (Alvarez & Emory, 2006; Baumeister & Vohs, 2004; Berkman et\u00a0al., 2017; Hoyle, 2010; Inzlicht et\u00a0al., 2021; Lezak et\u00a0al., 2012; Vohs & Finkel, 2006). In the context of this conceptual diversity, the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative, a neuroscience-based research framework introduced by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), provides an alternative, and arguably more comprehensive, conceptualization of one\u2019s ability to engage in behavioral regulation for optimal goal achievement (Insel et\u00a0al., 2010; National Institute of Mental Health, n.d.-a). Within the RDoC framework, regulatory processes implemented in the service of goal-directed behaviors are subsumed under the broader construct of cognitive control, which is conceptualized as a multifaceted, higher-order construct comprised of several subconstructs through which specific regulatory processes are implemented for achieving goal-directed behaviors. Specifically, goal selection, updating, representation, and maintenance (GS), and separately, response selection, and inhibition/suppression (RS), are considered under the RDoC framework as two distinct mechanisms (or subconstructs) that subserve cognitive control.1 Within this context, GS is typically operationalized by behavioral paradigms, such as task-switching/set-shifting\n1 Note that although performance monitoring is also proposed as a subconstruct of cognitive control within the RDoC, it is beyond the scope of this paper.\n1002\nCognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience (2022) 22:1001\u20131020\n1 3\nand tower tasks (National Institute of Mental Health, n.d.b). Such paradigms broadly assess an individual\u2019s ability to evaluate goal states, generate behavioral strategies for achieving said goal states, and adjust such plans based on changing demands so that behavioral goals can be optimally achieved (Ruocco et\u00a0al., 2014; Stemme et\u00a0al., 2007; Kiesel et\u00a0al., 2010). RS is typically operationalized by behavioral paradigms, such as go/no-go, stop signal, Stroop, and\nflanker tasks (National Institute of Mental Health, n.d.-c). These tasks evaluate an individual\u2019s ability to select the most appropriate response in a given context and to inhibit the propensity to select incorrect responses when faced with multiple response options for achieving a goal (Chikazoe, 2010; MacLeod, 1991). Therefore, GS appears to represent regulatory processes that are more deliberate (e.g., figuring out the steps to achieve behavioral goals), whereas RS\n1003\nCognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience (2022) 22:1001\u20131020\n1 3\nrepresents more time-limited or in-the-moment regulatory processes (e.g., enacting planned steps into appropriate behavioral responses) that occur in the service of achieving goal states. This multidimensional nature of cognitive control raises another key question: Do these two subcomponents of cognitive control relate to interpersonal trait domains and their constituent facets in a consistent way?\nIdentifying neural targets of\u00a0cognitive control\nMotivated behavior relies on an intricate array of neural regions (Dosenbach et\u00a0al., 2006; Fox et\u00a0al., 2005). Regulating such behavior, not surprisingly, also requires the complex interplay of various neural systems that perform basic (e.g., perceptual) and higher-order (e.g., integrating across systems) cognitive functions (Dosenbach et\u00a0al., 2008; Kouneiher et\u00a0al., 2009; Miller & Wallis, 2009; Swanson, 2000). Accordingly, cognitive control is suggested to be subserved by a network of brain regions that encompasses aspects of prefrontal, temporal, parietal, cingulate and occipital cortices, as well as subcortical regions, such as the caudate, putamen, thalamus, and the cerebellum (Mackie & Fan, 2017; Niendam et\u00a0al., 2012). As such, while there are many regions, both cortical and subcortical, that have been implicated in cognitive control-related processes, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been consistently identified as a crucial brain region necessary for cognitive control (Badre, 2008; Funahashi, 2001; Fuster, 2000; Koechlin & Hyafil, 2007; Logue & Gould, 2014). In this vein, the lateral aspects of the PFC, both dorsally (primarily consisting of the middle and superior frontal gyri) and ventrally (primarily consisting of the inferior frontal gyrus), have especially been highlighted as being crucial for various procedural elements that constitute cognitive control (Petrides, 2005). Therefore, while recognizing that it may function as part of a complex system that involves a network of brain areas, the lateral PFC has served as a key research target that has elucidated neural mechanisms underlying cognitive control function.\nImportantly, although both the left lateral PFC (LLPFC) and right lateral PFC (RLPFC) have been implicated in successful cognitive control, a growing body of research has provided important insights into specific mechanisms underlying cognitive control, suggesting a differential pattern of lateralization across its subconstructs. Specifically, cognitive and behavioral processes that constitute RS (e.g., inhibiting a preponent response and the selection of a correct response among distractors) have been consistently linked to the recruitment of the RLPFC to a much higher degree than its contralateral counterpart (Aron et\u00a0al., 2004; Chikazoe et\u00a0al., 2007; Swick et\u00a0al., 2011; Aron et\u00a0al., 2014; Rodrigo et\u00a0al., 2014). Conversely, recruitment of the LLPFC has been identified as a more prominent correlate of processes that constitute GS (e.g., planning, updating, and maintaining\ngoal states) compared with the RLPFC (Cazalis et\u00a0al., 2003; Kaller et\u00a0al., 2011; Metuki et\u00a0al., 2012; Ruocco et\u00a0al., 2014). Therefore, these nuanced patterns of functional recruitment of the lateral PFC during the performance of corresponding cognitive control behavioral tasks provide useful targets that may serve as neural markers that can help to elucidate whether subconstructs of cognitive control (i.e., RS and GS) show distinct relationships across individual differences, especially with regard to interpersonal dispositions."

            "text": "There is a longstanding acknowledgement that personality traits are \u201cneuropsychological\u201d or \u201cpsychobiological\u201d entities that stem from cognitive processes subserved by the brain (Cloninger, 1987; Eysenck, 1963; Fonagy & Higgitt, 1984; Tellegen, 1991). Little is known, however, regarding the specific associations between interpersonally relevant FFM traits and specific cognitive control mechanisms. This is especially the case with regard to (particularly prefrontal) neural correlates, which are used to operationalize specific cognitive control mechanisms. A small number of functional neuroimaging studies have attempted to shed light on the relationship between prefrontal neural correlates of RS and personality trait domains. Based on these studies, some evidence suggests that interpersonal traits may show distinct patterns of recruitment within the lateral PFC during RS-related processes. More specifically, higher levels of N have been linked to lower recruitment of lateral PFC regions during RS; conversely, higher levels of E, A, and C have been associated with greater recruitment of lateral PFC regions during RS (Eisenberger et\u00a0al., 2005; Sosic-Vasic et\u00a0al., 2012; Ikeda et\u00a0al., 2014; Rodrigo et\u00a0al., 2016). These findings suggest the possibility of a meaningful relationship between RS and interpersonally relevant traits. Specifically, they suggest a propensity for those who possess what are typically considered more favorable interpersonal dispositions (e.g., higher levels of E and A) to more strongly activate brain regions that are essential for important aspects of cognitive control (i.e., RS). To our knowledge, no study to date has examined the relationship between prefrontal correlates of GS and such interpersonal traits. As such, a comprehensive understanding of how interpersonal dispositions may be linked to specific aspects of cognitive control is yet to be established. This is a notable limitation, especially given the multifaceted nature of cognitive control. In addressing this limitation, neural correlates that can be reliably delineated across subconstructs of cognitive control can be especially useful for better understanding these relationships. Accordingly, clarifying the nuanced ways in which cognitive control relates to interpersonal dispositions can in turn further inform how this important cognitive ability is\n1004\nCognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience (2022) 22:1001\u20131020\n1 3\nconceptualized in the context of how people navigate their social environments. Furthermore, the possible relationships between aspects of cognitive control and interpersonally relevant facets within the FFM can further delineate the role of cognitive control within the interpersonal context."

            "text": "The present study was designed to address a broad research question: Do two key subconstructs of cognitive control relate to interpersonal trait domains and facets in distinct or similar ways? In this vein, the present study attempted to expand on the current, albeit limited, knowledge on the relationship between neural correlates of cognitive control and self-reported interpersonal traits. Specifically, we explored the associations between two subcomponents of cognitive control (i.e., RS and GS) and measured the corresponding hemodynamic response (oxygenated hemoglobin [oxy-Hb]) observed during performance of behavioral tasks intended to assess each cognitive control subconstruct (i.e., relative changes in oxy-Hb that occurred during previously validated cognitive control tasks) and self-reported interpersonal trait domains and facets within the FFM. Based on previous research that used identical neuroimaging paradigms as the ones used in the present study (Rodrigo et\u00a0al., 2014; Ruocco et\u00a0al., 2014), regions-of-interest (ROI) within the PFC that have been most robustly associated with each subconstruct of cognitive control were selected for analyses. Specifically, the RLPFC was selected as the ROI for RS, while the LLPFC was selected for GS (see the ROI selection description below for additional details).\nIn the service of our broad main research question, we had five specific goals. Our first research goal was informed by previous findings examining the link between FFM traits and RS-related neural recruitment. On the other hand, the remaining goals were designed to explore how the associations between the FFM and cognitive control can be further delineated across subconstructs of cognitive control and facets of the FFM. First, we sought to examine whether changes in oxy-Hb during RS are related differently to interpersonal trait domains within the FFM. Based on previous findings (Rodrigo et\u00a0al., 2016), we hypothesized that activation change within RLPFC during RS would show distinct associations across E, A, and N. Specifically, we anticipated that individuals with higher scores on the more interpersonally favorable traits (i.e., E and A) would be associated with a higher hemodynamic response within the RLPFC during RS, compared with those who report lower levels of these traits. On the other hand, those who report higher levels of N, a trait domain that is thought to be a risk factor for interpersonal dysfunction, were expected to be linked to attenuated recruitment within the RLPFC during RS, compared with those who\nreport lower N. Second, we explored whether the hemodynamic response associated with GS within the LLPFC would be moderated by participants\u2019 self-reported levels of E, A, and N. The third goal was to qualitatively explore whether the associations between these interpersonal traits and cognitive control-related neural recruitment represent unique patterns across RS and GS. The fourth goal was to explore the patterns of associations between oxy-Hb change linked to the above cognitive control subconstructs and the lower-order facets within the FFM. Specifically, we examined whether there is distinct within-trait-domain variability in these associations. Notably, a main emphasis was placed on the facets described as inherently interpersonal, as outlined in Table\u00a01. Finally, we sought to explore the associations between cognitive control-subconstructrelated hemodynamic responses and other traits (i.e., C and O) and their constituent facets that may\u00a0also be relevant to interpersonal functioning, albeit less directly."

This neuroimaging method provides several advantages that make it ideal for individual differences research, particularly making it an ideal choice for assessing large samples of participants within the context of personality and social neuroscience (Burns & Lieberman, 2019; Di Domenico et\u00a0al., 2019). Accordingly, in the present study, fNIRS was implemented using the fNIR Imager 1000\u00ae (fNIR Devices, Potomac, MD), a 16-channel continuous-wave fNIRS system.\nfNIRS procedure\nParticipants completed the neuroimaging protocol in a dimly lit room by interacting with a stimulus presentation computer with a mouse and keyboard, while the hemodynamic response within the PFC was monitored. Specifically, raw light intensities of light at 730-nm and 850-nm wavelengths were continuously measured with a frequency of 2 Hz and a measurement depth of 1.25 cm (Ayaz et\u00a0al., 2012). Prior to positioning the fNIRS sensor pad, participants\u2019 foreheads were cleaned with an alcohol swab to minimize residue (e.g., cosmetics or sweat). The sensor pad was then positioned on the forehead and was held in place with Velcro\u00ae straps. The sensor pad positioning corresponded to the standard electrode\npositions F7, FP1, FP2, and F8 on the international 10-20 system (as described by Jasper, 1958) and therefore captured hemodynamic activity in Brodmann areas 9, 10, 45, and 46 (Ruocco et\u00a0al., 2010). Participants then completed one or both of the cognitive tasks described below. During these cognitive tasks, an experimenter was seated quietly behind the participant to monitor the fNIRS equipment and data acquisition process.\nfNIRS signal processing\nfNIRS signal processing was performed by using the fNIRSoft\u00ae Professional Edition software package (Ayaz et\u00a0al., 2010, 2006). A low-pass filter (linear phase filter with an order of 20 and a cutoff frequency of 0.1 Hz) was applied to address possible high-frequency noise and physiological artifacts in the raw light intensities that were recorded (Izzetoglu et\u00a0al., 2005; Ayaz et\u00a0al., 2012). This was followed by a sliding-window motion artifact rejection algorithm for excluding data segments with signal distortions resulting from motion-related probe uncoupling and oversaturation or undersaturation of channels (Ayaz et\u00a0al., 2010). Activation segments in the resulting refined data were demarcated based on time synchronization markers that were received during cognitive task completion. Relative changes in concentrations of oxy-Hb were then extracted for these activation blocks across the 16 channels (Ayaz et\u00a0al., 2012)."

Accordingly, the task was comprised of three blocks that consisted solely of Go stimuli (for the purpose of provoking a prepotent response). Each of these homogenous blocks was followed by mixed blocks that contained pseudo-random combinations of both Go and No-Go stimuli (which pseudo-randomly required participants to withhold their prepotent response). Specifically, each mixed block consisted of 10 Go and 10 No-Go trials (with a total duration of 110 s), with a jittered crosshair fixation between trials to discourage anticipatory responding. Therefore, these mixed blocks represented cognitive processes underlying the cognitive control subconstruct of RS (i.e., selecting a response based on the presented stimulus/inhibiting a prepotent response). Hemodynamic changes during these mixed blocks were contrasted with their local baselines (i.e., first\n1006\n1 3\n10 s of each block; Rodrigo et\u00a0al., 2014) to represent RS in subsequent analyses."

During the MM condition, participants were presented with two tower configurations (i.e., initial and target) on a computer monitor. They were then asked to mentally calculate the number of moves that would be required to achieve the target configuration from the initial state within 7 s. They were then given 3 s to select either \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to the following question: \u201cCould it be done in exactly two moves?\u201d The MM condition consisted of pseudo-random combinations of either two-move or three-move stimuli to discourage random responding.

Both block types consisted of 20 stimuli. Hemodynamic change during the MM blocks were contrasted with the ZM blocks to represent GS in subsequent analyses.\nfNIRS ROI selection\nThe extracted time-series of oxy-Hb concentrations across individual channels were averaged to form RS- and GS-specific ROIs within the PFC. As previously stated, these ROIs were determined based on previous research that investigated these constructs using fNIRS and validated the experimental\nparadigms that were used in the present study. Specifically, as demonstrated by Rodrigo et\u00a0al.

To be consistent with this finding, the RS-related ROI in the present study was demarcated to consist of optode positions/channels 13, 14, and 16 and will be referred to as RLPFC for simplicity.

As outlined by Aiken et\u00a0al. (1991), we then examined the simple effects of domains or facets on the hemodynamic response associated with each subconstruct of cognitive control. Specifically, the presented results focus on the simple effects of high (i.e., one standard deviation [SD] above the mean) and low (i.e., one SD below the mean) levels of each domain or facet on hemodynamic change associated with each subconstruct of cognitive control (i.e., change in oxy-Hb from baseline). These results are summarized below, and further details are provided in supplementary materials. The simple effects of each domain or facet on overall hemodynamic activation during the baseline condition and during RS or GS conditions were explored and are included in the supplementary materials. To control for family-wise Type I error, the False Discovery Rate approach was used across each set of analyses that represented a trait domain or a facet (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995; Benjamini & Yekutieli, 2001). Accordingly, the reported p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons and are presented along with semi-partial R-squared (R\u03b22) as a measure of effect size (Edwards et\u00a0al., 2008)."

When examining the simple effects of traits on hemodynamic change associated with RS (i.e., change in oxyHb from baseline to RS), significant differences were seen across high and low levels of traits. Specifically, high (i.e., 1 SD above the mean) N was associated with significantly attenuated hemodynamic activity within the ROI (b = 0.17, p < 0.001, R\u03b22 = 0.0014) compared with low (i.e., 1 SD below the mean) N (b = 0.31, p < 0.001, R\u03b22 = 0.0046).

High E, on the other hand, was linked to a higher activation increase within the ROI (b = 0.28, p < 0.001, R\u03b22 = 0.0038), whereas lower E was linked to lower activation change (b = 0.20, p < 0.001, R\u03b22 = 0.0019). Similar to E, high C was linked to significantly increased activation within\nthe RLPFC (b = 0.29, p < 0.001, R\u03b22 = 0.0040), whereas low C was linked to attenuated activation when engaging in RS (b = 0.19, p < 0.001, R\u03b22 = 0.0017). Low O also was associated with reduced activation change (b = 0.15, p < 0.001, R\u03b22 = 0.0010) compared with high O (b = 0.33, p < 0.001, R\u03b22 = 0.0053). These results are detailed in Supplementary\u00a0Table\u00a01. The activation change associated with RS (from baseline to task condition) across high and low levels of all trait domains are depicted in Fig.\u00a02.\nRS \u00d7 Facet Interactions Significant cross-level interactions were found for all six facets of N (|b|s > 0.00, ps < 0.05, R\u03b22s > 0.00002) and A (|b|s > 0.01, ps < 0.001, R\u03b22s > 0.0002), whereas four of the six facets of E\u2014Gregariousness (E2), Assertiveness (E3), Activity (E4), and ExcitementSeeking (E5)\u2014also demonstrated significant interactions (|b|s > 0.01, ps < 0.001, R\u03b22s > 0.0001). Additionally, all six facets of O (|b|s > 0.00, ps < 0.01, R\u03b22s > 0.0001), and all facets of C, except for Self-Discipline (C5; b < 0.01, p = 0.35, R\u03b22 < 0.0001), also demonstrated significant interactions (|b|s > 0.004, ps < 0.001, R\u03b22s > 0.00004).\nVariability was apparent across facets under the trait domains when probing the simple effects of high and low levels of these facets on RS-related activation change within the RLPFC (Supplementary\u00a0Tables\u00a02-6).

Higher E4, conversely, was linked to lower hemodynamic change within the RLPFC (b = 0.20, p < 0.001, R\u03b22 = 0.0019) compared with lower E4 (b = 0.28 p < 0.001, R\u03b22 = 0.0038). Low trust (A1) was associated with reduced activation within the ROI during RS (b = 0.19, p < 0.001, R\u03b22 = 0.0017) compared with high A1 (b = 0.29, p < 0.001, R\u03b22 = 0.0040). Higher levels of all other facets of A were associated with lower activation in the ROI (bs \u2265 0.11, ps < 0.001, R\u03b22s > 0.0005) compared with lower levels (bs \u2265 0.28, ps < 0.001, R\u03b22s > 0.0038).\nRegarding facets for trait domains less directly related to interpersonal functioning, higher levels of Competence (C1), Order (C2), Dutifulness (C3), Achievement Striving (C4), and Deliberation (C6) were linked to larger increases in oxy-Hb within the ROI (bs \u2265 0.26, ps < 0.001, R\u03b22s >\n0.0036) compared with lower levels of these facets (bs \u2265 0.18, ps < 0.001, R\u03b22s > 0.0015). Additionally, lower levels of all facets of O were associated with attenuated recruitment of the RLPFC (bs \u2265 0.11, ps < 0.001, R\u03b22s > 0.0005) compared with higher levels (bs \u2265 0.26, ps < 0.001, R\u03b22s > 0.0032).

            "text": "The present study identified clear associations between cognitive control-related neural responses and interpersonal dispositions. To our knowledge, these results are the first to\nsuggest that key differences may exist regarding how these interpersonal dispositions relate to subcomponents of cognitive control. Some variability was also observed in the patterns of associations between interpersonally relevant facets within the FFM and neural activation during both RS and GS. Specifically, while most interpersonal facets showed similar patterns of associations with their corresponding higher-order trait domains, Self-Consciousness and Trust demonstrated opposite trends for RS, while Tender-Mindedness demonstrated an opposite trend for GS. Therefore, these results also are the first to suggest that a subset of the narrower facets in the FFM share divergent associations with cognitive control-related neural activity compared to the broader interpersonally relevant trait domains within which the facets are subsumed. Finally, while higher levels of both C and O were associated with a stronger hemodynamic response for RS, only C demonstrated a similar pattern of activation for GS, as O was not significantly associated with GS. Notable variability was also seen with regard to the facets that constitute these traits, with some facets demonstrating patterns of activation that were opposite to those linked to their trait domains.\nWhereas no trait domain showed a significant association with behavioral performances on the RS or GS tasks, different patterns of association were observed between\nN1 : A\nnx iet\ny\nN2 : A\nng ry\nHo s\nlity\nN3 : D\nep res\nsio n\nN4 : S\nelf -Co\nns cio\nus ne\nss\nN5 : Im\npu lsiv\nen ess\nN6 : V\nuln era\nbil ity -0.03 -0.02 -0.01 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08\nCh an\nge in\nO xy\n-H b\n(\u00b5 m\nol /l)\nE1 : W\narm th\nE2 : G\nreg ari\nou sn\ness\nE3 : A\nsse r\nve ne\nss\nE4 : A\nc vit\ny\nE5 : E\nxci tem\nen t-S\nee kin\ng\nE6 : P\nos i v\ne E mo\no ns-0.01\n0.00 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06\nCh an\nge in\nO xy\n-H b\n(\u00b5 m\nol /l)\nA1 : T\nrus t\nA2 : S\ntra igh\no rw\nard ne\nss\nA3 : A\nltr uis\nm\nA4 : C\nom pli\nan ce\nA5 : M\nod est\ny\nA6 : T\nen de\nr-M ind\ned ne\nss -0.04 -0.03 -0.02 -0.01 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08\nCh an\nge in\nO xy\n-H b\n(\u00b5 m\nol /l)\nC1 : C\nom pe\nten ce\nC2 : O\nrde r\nC3 : D\nu ful\nne ss\nC4 : A\nch iev\nem en\nt S tri\nvin g\nC5 : S\nelf -D\nisc ipl\nine\nC6 : D\neli be\nra on-0.02\n-0.01 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07\nCh an\nge in\nO xy\n-H b\n(\u00b5 m\nol /l)\nO1 : F\nan tas\ny\nO2 : A\nest he\nc s\nO3 : F\nee lin\ngs O4 : A c on s O5 : Id ea s O6 : V alu es\n-0.02 -0.01 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07\nCh an\nge in\nO xy\n-H b\n(\u00b5 m\nol /l)\na) b) c)\nd) e)\n\u00a7 \u00a7 \u00a7\n\u00a7 \u00a7 \u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7 \u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7\n\u00a7 \u00a7 \u00a7 \u00a7\n\u0180 \u0180 \u0180\n\u0180\nFig. 5 GS-related hemodynamic response within the RLPFC for high (+1SD) and low (-1SD) levels of facets that constitute a) Neuroticism, b) Extraversion, c) Agreeableness, d) Conscientiousness, e) Openness.

In keeping with our hypothesis, higher levels of E were associated with a stronger hemodynamic response within the RLPFC during RS, while high N was linked to an attenuated response within the same ROI. Contrary to our expectation, however, high A also was associated with lower hemodynamic recruitment within the RLPFC during RS. These interpersonal traits also demonstrated significant associations with the neural activation observed within the LLPFC during GS. Specifically, the hemodynamic response patterns during GS associated with both E and N were similar to those observed during RS. On the other hand, neural activation associated with A demonstrated an opposite trend, where higher A was linked to higher hemodynamic recruitment during GS within the ROI."

            "text": "Lower N was associated with a higher hemodynamic response within the RLPFC during RS, as compared to the attenuated level of activation associated with higher N. This is largely consistent with previous research, which also has demonstrated a link between N and attenuated PFC recruitment during tasks assessing RS (Rodrigo et\u00a0al., 2016; SosicVasic et\u00a0al., 2012). Therefore, this finding contributes to a growing body of neuroimaging evidence suggesting that N may be associated with lower cognitive control-related activation within the PFC (Forbes et\u00a0al., 2014; Servaas et\u00a0al., 2015; Xu & Potenza, 2012). Interestingly, however, there were divergences with regard to the associations between RS-related hemodynamic change and the two interpersonally relevant facets of N, which could suggest different underlying neural mechanisms for these facets. Specifically, whereas higher angry hostility (N2) was linked to an attenuated RSrelated activation change within the RLPFC, in line with the pattern observed for the broader trait domain, higher self-consciousness (N3) was associated with a stronger hemodynamic response. Although a previous neuroimaging investigation of RS-related processes using fMRI and an alternate questionnaire measuring self-consciousness did not report a significant association between this construct and lateral PFC recruitment (Eisenberger et\u00a0al., 2005), other neuroimaging evidence suggests that RLPFC in particular may represent an important neural correlate that subserves this construct (Morita et\u00a0al., 2008). Specifically, in line with its conceptualization within the FFM (i.e., sensitivity to evaluation by interpersonal others), the level of embarrassment experienced during socially evaluative situations was linked to the neural response within the RLPFC (Morita et\u00a0al., 2008). Furthermore, it has been proposed that the PFC more generally and the frontoparietal control network represent key neural architecture that is essential for the formation and maintenance of the concept of self (de Caso et\u00a0al., 2017;\nVogeley et\u00a0al., 1999). It is possible that such associations may, at least in part, underlie the finding observed in the present study with regard to this construct, which appears to show an opposite trend to the trait domain that it constitutes (i.e., N). The associations between RS-related hemodynamic response and all other facets of N were consistent with the pattern of associations observed with N.\nThe association between N and the GS-related activation change within the LLPFC was similar to what was observed in the context of RS and RLPFC, where lower N was linked to a stronger hemodynamic response associated with GS within the LLPFC (while higher N was not associated with a significant change in activation). Unlike in the case of RS, both interpersonally relevant facets of N (Angry Hostility [N2] and Self-Consciousness [N3]) demonstrated similar trends to that of N with regard to GS-related activation change. All other facets of N also demonstrated patterns of associations with GS-related hemodynamic response that are consistent with N. This further suggests the possibility that N is an interpersonal disposition that confers a lower cognitive control-related neural response in specific regions of the PFC, both with regard to the overall trait domain and across most of its constituting facets, with the possible exception of self-consciousness."

            "text": "In contrast to N, higher E was associated with a stronger RS-related hemodynamic response within the RLPFC, compared with lower E. This finding is consistent with previous research that demonstrates a positive association between RS-related behavioral tasks and lateral PFC activation (Eisenberger et\u00a0al., 2005; Rodrigo et\u00a0al., 2016). It has been suggested that the link between higher E and greater lateral PFC activation during RS may reflect a higher propensity for extroverts to engage in task-relevant cognitive control (Eisenberger et\u00a0al., 2005). The present results appear to further contribute to this idea but also suggest important variability across its constituent facets with regard to their associations with RS-related neural activation. Specifically, while two inherently interpersonal facets of E (Gregariousness [E2] and Assertiveness [E3]) demonstrated patterns of associations that were similar to E, a third (Warmth [E1]) did not demonstrate a significant relationship with the RSrelated hemodynamic response in the RLPFC.\nThe association between E and the GS-related hemodynamic response within the LLPFC was similar to the one seen during RS. Specifically, higher E was linked to a higher increase in oxy-Hb when engaging in GS compared with lower E. Similar to RS, both Gregariousness (E2) and Assertiveness (E3) demonstrated similar trends to E, whereas Warmth (E1) did not demonstrate a relationship with the GS-related hemodynamic response. Previous neuroimaging\n1015\nCognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience (2022) 22:1001\u20131020\n1 3\nresearch examining Warmth and Altruism (a facet of A) have linked these interpersonal processes to empathy-related neural activity within temporoparietal and medial prefrontal regions of the brain (Haas et\u00a0al., 2015). These results may suggest that Warmth, unlike Altruism which demonstrated associations with cognitive control-related processes in the present study, may represent an aspect of empathy that is independent of cognitive control-related processes.\nVariability was also seen with regard to other facets of E, where Excitement-Seeking (E5) showed a pattern of associations that were similar to E during RS, but Activity (E4) demonstrated an opposite trend. Positive Emotions (E6), on the other hand, was not associated with the RSrelated hemodynamic response within the LLPFC. During GS, the pattern of associations between Activity (E4) and oxy-Hb change during GS was similar to that of E, while both Excitement-Seeking (E5) and Positive Emotions (E6) did not demonstrate a significant relationship to the hemodynamic response. Although E4, E5, and E6 are not considered inherently interpersonal facets (Table\u00a01), these results highlight the possibly nuanced nature of cognitive control-related processes that may underlie the broader trait domain of E."

            "text": "Contrary to expectations, higher A was associated with a lower RS-related hemodynamic response relative to lower A. This finding appears to contradict a previous study that demonstrated an opposite result. Specifically, higher levels of A, as measured by the Big Five Inventory (BFI;\u00a0John & Srivastava, 1999), were linked to a stronger hemodynamic response within the RLPFC during an identical RS-related paradigm (Rodrigo et\u00a0al., 2016). This discrepancy, at least in part, may be accounted for by differences in how the construct of A is captured across various instruments (Miller et\u00a0al., 2011). Specifically, it has been suggested that A, as conceptualized within the NEO-PI-R, represents elements of Modesty (A5) and Straightforwardness (A2), which are suggested to be not fully captured within the BFI conceptualization of A. Perhaps consistent with this notion is the qualitative observation that higher Straightforwardness (A2) in the present study was associated with the lowest observed hemodynamic response within the RLPFC. Additionally, however, a previous investigation of 20 healthy adults also revealed a positive correlation between the hemodynamic response within the RLPFC linked to a specific aspect of RS (i.e., detection of response discrepancy) and A as measured using the Japanese version of the NEO Five Factor Inventory (Ikeda et\u00a0al., 2014). This perhaps suggests that the RSrelated hemodynamic response might be further nuanced based on specific subprocesses that constitute RS.\nDespite a high degree of positive correlation between A and its facets, Trust (A1) demonstrated a trend that was\nopposite to the broader trait domain and all other facets of A with regard to its associations with the RS-related hemodynamic response. Specifically, these results suggest that individuals who report a higher propensity to perceive others as trustworthy also demonstrate a stronger hemodynamic response within the RLPFC during RS. Previous research has suggested that, just like in the case of A (Koelsch et\u00a0al., 2013), RLPFC is a key neural region that subserves interpersonal trust (Filkowski et\u00a0al., 2016). The present results may further this knowledge by suggesting that the association between this neural substrate and Trust is perhaps nuanced, as it appears to be unique from its general trait domain of A during RS-related processes.\nFurther highlighting the nuanced nature in which A might relate to cognitive control-related processes, the association between A and the GS-related hemodynamic response within the LLPFC was opposite to that observed in relation to RS. Specifically, higher A was linked to relatively higher activation within the LLPFC compared with lower A. Therefore, unlike in the cases of N and E, which demonstrated similar patterns of associations across both RS- and GSrelated hemodynamic responses, A appears to demonstrate a pattern of neural recruitment that might be differentiated across specific subconstructs of cognitive control. Additionally, while five of the six facets of A (including Trust [A1]) demonstrated patterns of association with GS-related activation change that were similar to the overall trait domain, Tender-Mindedness (A6) demonstrated an opposite result, with individuals who reported lower Tender-Mindedness demonstrating a higher GS-related hemodynamic response within the LLPFC."

This pattern of association was also seen with regard to the GSrelated neural response within the LLPFC. Divergences were seen, however, with regard to the associations between the facets of C and the neural responses associated with RS and GS. Of note was the unexpected finding of higher Deliberation being linked to a larger hemodynamic response within the LLPFC, which appears to be contradictory to previous research that has demonstrated an opposite trend but within a smaller group of participants that does not overlap with the sample described in the present study (Ruocco et\u00a0al., 2014). Taken together, these findings may suggest that, unlike N, C may represent the propensity to adequately engage neural systems that underlie different aspects of cognitive control, albeit with some nuances at the level of its facets.\nWhile a previous study that examined O using a briefer measure of the FFM found no association between this trait\n1016\nCognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience (2022) 22:1001\u20131020\n1 3\nand RS-related hemodynamic activity (Rodrigo et\u00a0al., 2016), the present study indicates that higher O may be associated with a larger hemodynamic response during RS, compared with lower O. This pattern of associations was also consistent at the level of its constituent facets. While the trait domain O was not associated with the GS-related hemodynamic response, many of its facets demonstrated significant relationships with GS-related neural activity within the LLPFC, the directions of which appeared to vary across some facets. This highlights the possible differences that may exist with regard to how cognitive control-related processes may underlie this aspect of personality that may influence interpersonal functioning depending on the context."

            "text": "The present study examined a thin slice of cognitive control, which represents an incredibly complex cognitive process. Specifically, we focused on two previously established neural correlates of cognitive control subconstructs (i.e., RS and GS) in specific regions of the PFC. As previously mentioned, it is important to recognize that cognitive control requires the interplay between several neuroanatomical networks spanning cortical and subcortical regions, and although lateral PFC regions examined in the present study are necessary, they are not sufficient for the successful exertion of cognitive control. On the other hand, to date, little guidance exists with regard to how cognitive control processes may be associated with interpersonally relevant dispositions. To that end, the present study provides important early evidence that may guide future research, which should examine how the involvement of cognitive control processes in interpersonal functioning can be further delineated with better neuroanatomical specificity. Accordingly, future research could contextualize associations between cognitive control and interpersonal functioning within the structural and functional nuances that might better differentiate between subconstructs of cognitive control.\nDespite its many advantages, fNIRS also presents several limitations as compared to other neuroimaging modalities, such as fMRI. Of note is its limited penetration into cortical tissue, only allowing the surface of the cortex to be examined. Promisingly, however, previous fNIRS findings highlighting lateral PFC involvement in cognitive control have been largely consistent with fMRI findings that examine similar constructs (Rodrigo et\u00a0al., 2014; Ruocco et\u00a0al., 2014). fNIRS also does not provide a measure of cortical volume and is solely focused on relative change in hemodynamic activity. In this vein, it is important to consider that previous structural neuroimaging findings suggest that personality traits may be linked to individual differences in cortical volume (DeYoung et\u00a0al., 2010). Therefore, future\nresearch should attempt to account for the role of structural, in addition to functional, aspects of cognitive control processes in interpersonal functioning.\nAdditionally, the present study focused on examining nuances in the neural signature that were associated with successful cognitive control (i.e., when all participants demonstrate mostly accurate behavioral performances). This allowed the assessment of RS and GS, with minimal overlap with neural processes that may subserve error correction, which constitutes performance monitoring (another key aspect of cognitive control). Future research could extend these findings by also examining how this additional aspect of cognitive control may relate to interpersonal traits and facets. We also did not obtain repeated measurements, which would have allowed us to quantify the reliability of the fNIRS signal as it pertains to the cognitive tasks included in the study. Additional research is needed to determine whether the hemodynamic response is reliably activated by the RS and GS tasks and the potential impacts on the observed associations with interpersonal dispositions. Furthermore, the present study demonstrates the presence of important distinctions in associations between the propensity for interpersonal behaviour (i.e., interpersonal traits and facets) and the neural signature linked to aspects of cognitive control, even when such patterns of associations may not be apparent at the behavioral level. Therefore, it would be important for future research to extend these findings and explore how these possible distinctions in the neural correlates of cognitive control may translate into interpersonal behavior. Finally, research is needed to clarify, where possible, the directionality and mechanisms underlying the observed findings."
