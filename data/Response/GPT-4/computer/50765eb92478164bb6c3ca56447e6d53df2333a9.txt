Cross-Cultural and Institutional Variability in EEP Participation: Investigate how cultural and institutional factors influence men's and women's decisions to participate in EEPs across different countries and educational institutions. This research could uncover whether the themes identified (e.g., entrepreneurial self-efficacy, entrepreneurial intent) are universally applicable or vary significantly with cultural and institutional context.

Longitudinal Impact of EEP Participation on Career Trajectories: Conduct a longitudinal study to assess how participation in EEPs influences the career paths of engineering graduates, with a particular focus on gender differences. This research could examine whether EEP participation leads to different outcomes in terms of venture creation, engagement in entrepreneurial activities, or career advancements in traditional engineering roles.

The Role of Pedagogical Practices in Shaping Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy and Intent: Explore how specific pedagogical practices within EEPs (e.g., pitch competitions, experiential learning projects) differently affect men's and women's entrepreneurial self-efficacy and intent. This study could identify instructional strategies that are particularly effective or detrimental to fostering an inclusive and supportive learning environment for all genders.

Peer Influence and Social Networks in EEP Engagement: Examine the role of peer influence and social networks in encouraging or discouraging participation in EEPs among men and women. This research could explore how peer interactions, mentorship, and the presence of role models within the engineering entrepreneurship community affect students' decisions to engage with EEPs.

Designing EEPs for Non-Venture-Oriented Entrepreneurial Careers: Investigate the needs and preferences of students, especially women, who are interested in entrepreneurial skills but not necessarily in starting their own ventures. This study could guide the development of EEPs that cater to a broader range of career goals, including roles in innovation within existing organizations, social entrepreneurship, and technology transfer.
