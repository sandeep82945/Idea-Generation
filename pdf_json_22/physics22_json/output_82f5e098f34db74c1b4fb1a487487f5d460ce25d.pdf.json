    "abstractText": "Of indisputable relevance for non-equilibrium thermodynamics, fluctuations theorems have been generalized to the framework of quantum thermodynamics, with the notion of work playing a key role in such contexts. The typical approach consists of treating work as a stochastic variable and the acting system as an eminently classical device with a deterministic dynamics. Inspired by technological advances in the field of quantum machines, here we look for corrections to work fluctuations theorems when the acting system is allowed to enter the quantum domain. This entails including the acting system in the dynamics and letting it share a nonclassical state with the system acted upon. Moreover, favoring a mechanical perspective to this program, we employ a concept of work observable. For simplicity, we choose as theoretical platform the autonomous dynamics of a two-particle system with an elastic coupling. For some specific processes, we derive several fluctuation theorems within both the quantum and classical statistical arenas. In the quantum results, we find that, along with entanglement and quantum coherence, aspects of inertia also play a significant role since they regulate the route to mechanical equilibrium.",

Box 19044, 81531-980, Curitiba, Parana\u0301, Brazil\n2Schulich Faculty of Chemistry and Helen Diller Quantum Center, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 3200003, Israel\nOf indisputable relevance for non-equilibrium thermodynamics, fluctuations theorems have been generalized to the framework of quantum thermodynamics, with the notion of work playing a key role in such contexts. The typical approach consists of treating work as a stochastic variable and the acting system as an eminently classical device with a deterministic dynamics. Inspired by technological advances in the field of quantum machines, here we look for corrections to work fluctuations theorems when the acting system is allowed to enter the quantum domain. This entails including the acting system in the dynamics and letting it share a nonclassical state with the system acted upon. Moreover, favoring a mechanical perspective to this program, we employ a concept of work observable. For simplicity, we choose as theoretical platform the autonomous dynamics of a two-particle system with an elastic coupling. For some specific processes, we derive several fluctuation theorems within both the quantum and classical statistical arenas. In the quantum results, we find that, along with entanglement and quantum coherence, aspects of inertia also play a significant role since they regulate the route to mechanical equilibrium.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nFluctuation theorems (FTs) have been extended from the field of stochastic thermodynamics to general quantum scenarios [1\u20137], standing out as insightful relations connecting fluctuating quantities to aspects of thermal equilibrium. Among the regarded fluctuating quantities, work plays a prominent role for two reasons: (i) it is of key relevance for complete statements of the energy conservation law and (ii) work FTs yield sensible formulations of the second law of thermodynamics in terms of equilibrium free energy.\nParamount for any unambiguous definition of work is the specification of both the \u201cacting system\u201d (from now on referred to as agent), the one that applies the driving force, and the \u201csystem acted upon\u201d (hereafter, receiver), the one which the force is applied on. Of course, in light of Newton\u2019s third law, there is no fundamental reason preventing one to assign to a given physical system the role of either agent or receiver (this labeling is done by free choice), but the notion of work and internal energy can only make sense through such a clear definition.\nIn the usual stochastic thermodynamics scenarios, the agent1 is classical in essence, meaning that it is rigidly controlled by an external observer who assigns to it a predetermined time dependence [see Fig. 1(a)]. In effect, the agent\u2019s influence over time is entirely encoded in a function \u03bbt \u2261 \u03bb(t) [6, 7, 9], a prescription also adopted in the formalism of statistical physics [10]. As a result, the Hamiltonian describing the receiver\u2019s dynamics is an explicitly time-dependent function usually written in the form H(t) \u2261 H(\u03bbt) = H0 + V(\u03bbt), where H0 is the so-called bare Hamiltonian and V(\u03bbt) is an interaction term [7, 11]. Within this\n\u2217 pinto silva@campus.technion.ac.il 1 In fact, there are some approaches in which the classicalization is intro-\nduced in the receiver\u2019s dynamics instead of the agent\u2019s [8]. Nonetheless, this is not the usual perspective.\nperspective, concepts of work and acclaimed work FTs [7, 12\u2013 14] were proposed, with work depending either implicitly or explicitly on \u03bbt [11, 15].\nAmong the results known today, the Jarzynski equality [12] certainly stands out, being suitable for a large set of applications and experimental platforms (see [1, 7, 16, 17] and references therein), with some extensions to more general scenarios [7, 18, 19]. Departing from the so-called inclusive work [11],Winc(t, 0) = \u222b t 0 dt \u2032 \u2202H(t\u2032) \u2202t\u2032 , Jarzynski arrived at\n\u3008e\u2212\u03b2Winc(t,0)\u3009 = ZtZ0 , (1)\nwith Zt = \u222b d\u0393 e\u2212\u03b2H(t) denoting the partition function at the\nar X\niv :2\n21 1.\n16 17\n9v 4\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n1 9\nM ay\n2 02\n3\n2 instant t and d\u0393 the infinitesimal phase-space volume accessible to the receiver. In another vein, it was only posteriorly acknowledged [7, 11, 15, 20] that a distinct fundamental relation had already been derived by Bochkov and Kuzovlev (BK) in their late 1970s article [13]. BK deduced the equality\n\u3008e\u2212\u03b2Wexc(t,0)\u3009 = 1 (2)\nunder assumptions very similar to those of Jarzynski\u2019s approach, except that an exclusive form of work, Wexc(t, 0) =\u222b t\n0 dt \u2032 dH0\ndt\u2032 , was used instead. The distinction between inclusive and exclusive work led not only to different FTs, as in Eqs. (1) and (2), but also to different work-energy relations, this being the source of an intense debate [11, 15, 21\u201325]. It turns out that the inclusive approach used to deduce the Jarzynski equality is close to a thermodynamical picture of work [8, 59], where the interaction energy with external bodies is accounted as part of the internal energy. On the other hand, the exclusive definition has its essential features very closely related to those of a mechanical notion of work, as in the Newtonian description of massive point particles, where the internal energy does not generally encompass external degrees of freedom [22].\nWhen going to a quantum regime, the usual route to describe work and work FTs has been to directly quantize the classical Hamiltonian H(t) into a time-dependent operator H(t) \u2261 H(\u03bbt) describing the internal energy, with the agent\u2019s influence being encoded in the control parameter \u03bbt. As a consequence, \u03bbt-dependent work definitions analogous to the classical ones were proposed [8, 26\u201335]. Still in the nonautonomous context, a debate emerged around the fact that some of the work definitions lead to results that deviate from the usual classical FTs [27\u201329, 36, 37]. Indeed, it was later shown that work definitions could not simultaneously satisfy two natural requirements, namely, (i) that mean energy variation corresponds to average work and (ii) that work statistics agree with usual classical results for initial states with no coherence in the energy basis [35]. As a result, further work definitions were introduced and modified work FTs deduced [7, 28, 36, 38]. In none of these approaches, however, the role of the agent\u2019s configuration was critically addressed from a purely quantum substratum, so that the use of a classical parameter \u03bbt was unavoidable.\nNow, what if the external control is turned off and the composite system \u201cagent + receiver\u201d is let to evolve autonomously, as depicted in Fig. 1(b)? How can one compute and make sense of work FTs? With the ever-growing interest in thermodynamics phenomena in the quantum regime, the search for generalizations of the concept of work and FTs for autonomous scenarios started to make sense. Within this agenda, autonomous machines have been analyzed [39\u2013 42], the effects of correlations, coherences, degeneracy, thermal fluctuations, and information resources on thermodynamics have been studied [43\u201347], and batteries (or work reservoirs) have explicitly been considered in the dynamics [48, 49]. Alternatively, some constraints (sometimes taken as general quantum FTs) have been obtained for a general class of systems [50\u201352] and other forms to statistically describe work and other thermodynamics properties have been\ndiscussed [53\u201357]. Still, no detailed analysis has so far been reported describing how the well-known FTs are affected in dynamics far away from the usual stochastic thermodynamics regimes, in particular when the agent is no longer classical. Filling this gap is the primary goal of the present work.\nHere, we examine how work FTs manifest themselves when we push the system a bit further into the quantum domain. Basically, we pursue a fundamentally mechanical treatment characterized by two key elements. First, we let the agent be submitted, along with the receiver, to a closed energy-conserving autonomous dynamics, upon which no external control \u03bbt is ever imposed. In particular, we allow the composite system \u201cagent + receiver\u201d to be prepared in nontrivial quantum states, eventually encoding coherence, quantum correlations, and local thermal effects. Moreover, we allow the subsystems to strongly interact with each other without demanding the interaction to be time-independent or even to fade over time [50\u201352]. To the best of our knowledge, these regimes have remained widely unexplored so far. Second, we abandon the usual thermodynamical essence assigned to work in favor of an operator-based model, which naturally attaches a fundamentally quantum mechanical character to this concept. In effect, this model treats work as a Heisenberg observable admitting an eigensystem for each given process and genuine quantum fluctuations [58]. Despite some skepticism to treating work as an observable [5, 7, 29, 36], the work observable formalism was shown to be experimentally testable and physically sound, besides being approachable as a twotime element of reality. At last, taking the operator W as the work done by the agent on the receiver, we compute the average \u3008e\u2212\u03b21W\u3009, with \u03b21 being an effective inverse temperature underlying the receiver\u2019s initial state. To free the discussion of unnecessary technicalities, our theoretical platform is chosen to be as simple as possible: we consider a two-particle system, with elastic coupling, evolving over specific time intervals. Although the framework here introduced to evaluate \u3008e\u2212\u03b21W\u3009 can be applied to more general scenarios, this simple system suffices to show that work FTs may depend on the features of the receiver and agent. Our results are then compared with the BK equality (2), which is closer to the mechanical paradigm than Jarzynski\u2019s formula (1). To highlight the genuinely quantum aspects of our results, we conduct classical studies in parallel employing the usual Newtonian notion of work, with its statistics being raised in accordance with the Liouvillian framework. Although our work FTs are shown to accurately retrieve BK\u2019s equality in some regimes (see also the Appendix for a related discussion), they manifest themselves rather differently, and somewhat surprisingly, in quantum instances."

            "text": "We start by investigating the classical statistical framework, wherein the celebrated FTs were originally derived. Consider two particles of masses m1,2 interacting via an elastic potential of characteristic constant k. The autonomous dynamics is\n3 governed by the Hamiltonian function\nH = p21\n2m1 + p22 2m2 + k 2 (x2 \u2212 x1)2, (3)\nwhere xi (pi) is the position (momentum) of the i-th particle. Henceforth, particle 1 (2) will assume the role of receiver (agent). Within a mechanical perspective, the workW(t2, t1) done by particle 2 on particle 1 during the time interval [t1, t2], is defined as\nW(t2, t1) B \u222b t2\nt1 dt m1 x\u03081 x\u03071 = \u2206K , (4)\nwhere \u2206K = K1(t2)\u2212K1(t1), with K1(t) = m1 x\u030721(t)\n2 being the kinetic energy of particle 1 (receiver\u2019s internal energy). Thus, Eq (4) is the usual statement of the energy-work theorem [60].\nAiming at computing the statistics underlying W(t2, t1), we explicitly solve the Hamilton equations in terms of the initial phase space point \u03930 = (x01, p 0 1, x 0 2, p 0 2) \u2261 [x1(0), p1(0), x2(0), p2(0)]. The procedure is facilitated by the use of the center-of-mass and relative coordinates\nxcm = (m1x1 + m2x2)/M, xr = x2 \u2212 x1, pcm = p1 + p2, pr = \u00b5 (p2/m2 \u2212 p1/m1) ,\n(5)\nwith \u00b5 = m1m2/M and M = m1 + m2. In the transformed Hamiltonian,H = p2cm/2M + p2r /2\u00b5 + kx2r /2, the new degrees of freedom decouple and the trajectories are trivially derived:\nxtcm = x 0 cm + p 0 cmt/M, xtr = x 0 r cos (\u03c9t) + (p 0 r /\u00b5\u03c9) sin (\u03c9t) , ptcm = p 0 cm, ptr = p 0 r cos (\u03c9t) \u2212 \u00b5\u03c9x0r sin (\u03c9t) ,\n(6)\nwith \u03c9 = \u221a\nk/\u00b5. Returning to the original variables, we can write an expression for the momentum of particle 1 at a generic time t,\npt1(\u03930) = a(t) p 0 1 + b(t) p 0 2 + c(t) ( x02 \u2212 x01 ) , (7) a(t) = [m1 + m2 cos (\u03c9t)] /M, b(t) = [1 \u2212 cos (\u03c9t)] m1/M, c(t) = \u00b5\u03c9 sin (\u03c9t) . (8)\nAs a result, we are able to write the kinetic energy K1(t) and the work W(t2, t1) as explicit functions of the initial phase point \u03930. For the sake of analytical convenience (which will be specially welcome within the quantum context treated posteriorly), hereafter we restrict our analysis to processes occurring within the time intervals [t1, t2] = [0, v\u03c4], with v an odd integer and \u03c4 = \u03c0/\u03c9. With the notationW(\u03930) \u2261 W (v\u03c4, 0), the resulting work can be written as\nW(\u03930) = 2\nM2 (m1 p02 \u2212 m2 p01)(p01 + p02). (9)\nTo raise the work statistics, we consider an initial distribution %(\u03930), so that the mean value of a well-behaved function f [W(\u03930)] is given by\n\u3008 f (W)\u3009% = \u222b d\u03930 f [W(\u03930)] %(\u03930).

By use of the distribution (11), the averaging prescribed by Eq. (10) for the function f [W(\u03930)] = e\u2212\u03b2W(\u03930) results in\n\u3008e\u2212\u03b21W\u3009%TG = m1 + m2 |m1 \u2212 m2| . (14)\nIn comparison with the BK formula (2), the differences are clear and insightful, specially with regard to the finite inertia of the agent. Notably, the BK formula is recovered as m1m2 \u2192 0, the limit in which xt2 \u2192 xtcm = x0cm + p0cmt/m2. This is the precise regime for which the BK equality was deduced, viz. the one presuming that the agent acts as a deterministic classical driver whose dynamics (not necessarily uniform) can in no way be disturbed by the receiver. Therefore, the dependence of the result (14) on the masses is a direct consequence of the autonomous character of the dynamics under scrutiny. Also noticeable is the fact that Eq. (14) does not depend on the details of the preparation, such as r\u03042, \u03c32, and \u22061 = \u221a m1/\u03b21. This particular aspect may be a consequence of the quadratic structure of the model and eventual peculiarities underlying the chosen time interval. In any case, this reveals that, as long as the condition m2 m1 is satisfied, the BK equality holds even in the regime of a highly fluctuating agent distribution, for which the notion of a deterministic classical control can no longer be sustained. In fact, as discussed in the Appendix, this is a special case of a more general result for autonomous dynamics: the BK equality can actually be retrieved whenever the agent\u2019s dynamics is sufficiently independent of the receiver\u2019s degrees of freedom.\n2 In some thermodynamic instances, %(x) was chosen to characterize a particle confined in a box [10, 61].\n4 We now conduct our second case study, wherein both receiver and agent are initially given thermal states with respective inverse temperatures \u03b21 and \u03b22. The composite thermalthermal (TT) distribution reads\n%TT(\u03930) = T\u22061 (x01, p01) T\u22062 (x02, p02), (15)\nwhere \u2206i = \u221a\nmi/\u03b2i with i \u2208 {1, 2}. The calculations show that the result is identical to the previous one, that is, \u3008e\u2212\u03b21W\u3009%TT = \u3008e\u2212\u03b21W\u3009%TG . Again, the inertial aspects are seen to prevail over any other elements of the preparation, even the arbitrary temperatures \u03b21,2.\nThe situation gets more interesting when we come to our third case study. Here we let not only thermal ingredients be present but also correlations. The initial distribution is chosen to be\n%c(\u03930) = T\u22061 (x01, p01) %x(x02)\u03b4D(p02 \u2212 cp01), (16)\nwhere \u03b4D is the Dirac delta function, c \u2208 R\u22650 is a dimensionless parameter whose role is discussed below, and again %x(x02) is a generic probability distribution. It is not difficult to check that both marginals are thermal distributions, that is,\n%i(x0i , p 0 i ) \u2261 \" dx0j dp 0 j %c(\u03930) = T\u2206i (x0i , p0i ), (17)\nwith i, j \u2208 {1, 2} and j , i. An interesting aspect is the appearance of the local inverse temperature \u03b22(c) \u2261 \u03b21c2 m2 m1\nderiving from the connection \u22062 = c\u22061. We see, therefore, that c is a direct estimate of both the correlations between the particles and the agent\u2019s thermal momentum uncertainty. Through the procedure established previously, we arrive at\n\u3008e\u2212\u03b21W\u3009%c = m1 + m2\n|m1 \u2212 m2 + 2m1c| . (18)\nIn direct comparison with Eq. (14), the above result demonstrates that classical correlations can influence work FTs in a relevant way. In particular, for m1 = m2, one has \u3008e\u2212\u03b21W\u3009%c = 1 c = \u221a \u03b22/\u03b21, which makes explicit the strong dependence of the result also on the local temperatures. From a broader perspective, result (18) reveals an interesting generalization of the BK formula: by getting apart from the typical thermodynamics setting wherein the agent is a deterministic driver, we find that work FTs can strongly depend on both inertia and, via correlations, agent\u2019s effective temperature, T2 = [kB\u03b22(c)]\u22121.\nWith the aim of getting more insight about our results, it is opportune to make some digression on energetics. Direct application of Jensen\u2019s inequality, \u3008g(X)\u3009 > g(\u3008X\u3009), with g a convex function and X a random variable, allows us to express the Jarzynski equality (1) in the form \u3008Winc(t, 0)\u3009 \u2265 \u2206F, where Ft = \u2212\u03b2\u22121 lnZt denotes the equilibrium free energy at instant t and \u2206F = Ft \u2212 F0. This inequality bounds the mean inclusive work with quantities directly associated with the thermodynamic equilibrium and allows one to make inferences, through the sign of \u2206F, about the spontaneity of a physical process. On the other hand, no symptom of thermodynamic equilibrium shows up straightforwardly in the BK\nequality (2). Still, the derivation of this formula presumes important thermodynamic elements, namely, the preparation of a thermal state for the receiver and an external classical control. These aspects are crucial for a deeper understanding of the relation \u3008Wexc(t, 0)\u3009 \u2265 0 bounding the mean exclusive work. Basically, this inequality states that the agent can only deliver energy to the receiver. This can be explained via the following rationale. One, the thermal state imposes to the receiver a scenario of energetic minimization constrained to a certain temperature. Two, the agent has no need to consume energy from its interaction with the receiver because the agent\u2019s dynamics is deterministically pumped by an external control. Thus, the average result of such dynamics cannot be other than an increase of the receiver\u2019s internal energy. To make contact with this framework, we rephrase our results as\n\u3008W\u3009% \u2265 \u2212\u03b2\u221211 ln \u3008e\u2212\u03b21W\u3009% . (19)\nFor the processes under scrutiny, the work FTs (14) and (18) have shown to be independent of thermodynamic equilibrium quantities, like \u03b21 and \u22061, and strongly dependent on inertia, which is the physical element capable of tuning the mechanical equilibrium. In effect, when m1(2) m2(1) one of the particles approximately remains in uniform motion (mechanical equilibrium). Although the BK formula is retrieved in this regime, the scenarios are still different, since in BK\u2019s approach the agent\u2019s motion, being dictated by \u03bbt, does not need to be uniform. On the other hand, whenever \u3008e\u2212\u03b21W\u3009% 1, the work FTs largely deviate form the BK formula, and the lower bound in relation (19) can become significantly negative, meaning that the agent is now allowed to draw energy from the receiver. This regime is favored when m1 ' m2, an instance in which energy exchange between agent and receiver is expected to be ubiquitous throughout the dynamics and, hence, the concept of mechanical equilibrium evaporates. Interestingly, we see by Eq. (18) that, even in the regime of mechanical equilibrium (m2 m1), an amount c = (m2\u2212m1)2m1 of classical correlations is able to significantly disturb the directionally of the energetic flow typical of the BK scenario. Given the above, it is fair to conclude that the work FTs we thus far obtained make important connections with elements of mechanical (instead of thermodynamic) equilibrium."

            "text": "In full analogy with the classical model studied in the previous section, we now consider particles of masses m1 and m2 evolving autonomously under the unitary dynamics implied by the Hamiltonian operator\nH = P21\n2m1 + P22 2m2 + k 2 (X2 \u2212 X1)2, (20)\nwhere Xi (Pi) is the position (momentum) operator of the i-th particle. The quantum preparation \u03c1 and H act on the joint Hilbert space H = H1 \u2297 H2. As before, particle 1 (2) will play the role of the receiver (agent).\n5 Since we are interested in exploring FTs under a mechanical perspective, we employ the definition of work proposed in Ref. [58]. Accordingly, we use the Heisenberg picture, wherein the operators evolve in time according to the relation O \u2261 O(t) = U\u2020t OsUt, where Os is the corresponding Schro\u0308dinger operator and Ut = exp(\u2212iHst/~) is the time evolution operator. In this framework, the velocity and the acceleration of the receiver can be expressed respectively as X\u03071 = [X1,H]/i~ and X\u03081 = [X\u03071,H]/i~. The quantum mechanical work done by the agent on the receiver within a time interval [t1, t2] is then defined as [58]\nW(t2, t1)B \u222b t2\nt1 dt m1 {X\u03071, X\u03081} 2 = \u2206K, (21)\nwhere \u2206K= K1(t2)\u2212K1(t1), with K1(t) = m1 X\u030721 (t)\n2 being the kinetic energy of particle 1 (receiver\u2019s internal energy). Definition (21) can be seen as the quantum analog of (4), i.e., the Heisenberg statement of the energy-work theorem, which, as shown in Ref. [58], is just a specialization of a more general formulation for quantum systems.\nWe now proceed to obtain explicit expressions for W(t2, t1). Again, we decouple the Hamiltonian operator as H = P2cm/2M + P 2 r /2\u00b5 + kX 2 r /2, by means of the operator transformation\nXcm = (m1X1 + m2X2)/M, Xr = X2 \u2212 X1, Pcm = P1 + P2, Pr = \u00b5 (P2/m2 \u2212 P1/m1) .\n(22)\nAs in the classical model, the analytical solutions are very simple and allow us to write [58]\nP1(t) = a(t) Ps1 + b(t) P s 2 + c(t) ( Xs2 \u2212 Xs1 ) , (23)\nwith the same functions a(t), b(t), and c(t) defined in Eqs. (8). Restricting again our analysis to the time interval [t1, t2] = [0, v\u03c4], with \u03c4 = \u03c0/\u03c9 and v an odd integer, and introducing the compact notation W = W(v\u03c4, 0), we find\nW = 2\nM2 (m1Ps2 \u2212 m2Ps1)(Ps1 + Ps2) (24)\nfor the operator work done by the agent on the receiver in the process defined by the time interval [0, v\u03c4]. It is clear that W is diagonal in the composite basis {|p1, p2\u3009}, with eigenvalues wp1,p2 = 2 M2 (m1 p2 \u2212 m2 p1)(p1 + p2) keeping a direct conceptual connection with the classical work (9). Here is the fundamental reason behind our choice of such very particular time intervals; although allowed by our formalism, other choices would demand the numerical diagonalization of W. (Possibly, they would also yield different FTs.) Result (24) tells us that by jointly measuring Ps1,2, one prepares an amount wp1,p2 of work in the interval [0, v\u03c4]. It is worth noticing that one does not really \u201cmeasure\u201d work by measuring the momenta. As discussed in Ref. [58] and readily seen from the computations above, a work measurement cannot be performed (not even within the classical paradigm) simply because a two-time\nobservable is not definable at a single time. Instead, we \u201cprepare\u201d work for the interval [0, v\u03c4] through the establishment of \u03c1 at t = 0.\nHaving computed the work observable (24), we can raise the statistics associated with any well-behaved function f (W) for an initial state \u03c1 acting on the joint spaceH via\n\u3008 f (W)\u3009\u03c1 = \" dp1 dp2 f (wp1,p2 ) %(p1, p2), (25)\nwhere %(p1, p2) = \u3008p1, p2|\u03c1|p1, p2\u3009. In what follows, we analyze the expectation value of the operator f (W) = e\u2212\u03b21W in instances analogous to those considered in the classical context, but also, and most importantly, in fundamentally quantum scenarios. For the sake of notational compactness and analytical convenience, we introduce the parameters\n\u2261 \u03c31 \u22061\nand \u03b3 \u2261 \u03c31 \u22061 \u03c32 \u22061 , (26)\nin terms of which most of the discussion that follows will be conducted. The interpretations of \u03c31,2 and \u22061 are the same ones employed in the classical scenarios of Sec. II."

Being able to avoid the singularities and normalization problems typical of continuum bases and being very convenient for analytical computations, this state actually is an approximation to a genuine thermal state with inverse temperature \u03b21. This can be checked from the matrix elements\n\u3008p\u20321|T\u22061(\u03c31)|p1\u3009= exp\n[ \u2212 p \u2032 1\n2+p21 4\u220621(1+ 2) \u2212 (p\u20321\u2212p1)\n2\n8\u220621 2(1+ 2) ] \u221a\n2\u03c0\u220621(1 + 2)\n,\nwhich renders, as \u2192 0, vanishing coherences and the populations \u3008p1|T\u22061 (\u03c31)|p1\u3009 \u221d e\u2212\u03b21K1 with K1 = p21/2m1. That\n6 is, when the momentum fluctuation \u03c31 of the Gaussian state G(0,p),\u03c31 is much smaller than the thermal fluctuation \u22061, then T\u22061 (\u03c31) approaches a fully incoherent mixture (in the kinetic energy basis) with thermal populations. Consequently, whenever 1, \u03c1TG as defined by Eq. (27) is a reasonable quantum analog of %TG as given by Eq. (11). Following the prescription indicated by Eq. (25), with f (W) = e\u2212\u03b21W , we arrive at\n\u3008e\u2212\u03b21W\u3009\u03c1TG = (m1 + m2) M exp 2m21 2 p\u030422 M2\u220621  , (30) where\nM \u2261 \u221a (m1 \u2212 m2)2 \u2212 4m1(m1\u03b32 + m2 2). (31)\nThe above FT, which was derived under the convergence condition M2 > 0 for generic values of \u03c31,2 and \u22061, clearly depends on the equilibrium temperature, through \u22061, but also on the momentum uncertainties \u03c31,2 and the masses m1,2, whose values regulate the connection with mechanical equilibrium. Now, the series expansion to first order in , for arbitrary \u03c32, yields\n\u3008e\u2212\u03b21W\u3009\u03c1TG m1 + m2 |m2 \u2212 m1| \u0393, (32)\nwhere \u0393 \u2261 [ 1\u2212 ( 2m1\u03b3\nm1\u2212m2 )2 ]\u2212 12 . Note that the instance of a localized agent (\u03c32 \u22061) is allowed as long as the convergence condition is preserved. On the other hand, when the agent looses spatial localization, so that \u03b3 1, then we retrieve the classical result (14), that is, \u3008e\u2212\u03b21W\u3009\u03c1TG \u3008e\u2212\u03b21W\u3009%TG , and no dependence on the temperature \u22061 remains. Again, inertia is seen to play a role in the FT and BK\u2019s formula for the nonautonomous scenario is readily retrieved for m2 m1. It is worth emphasizing that the BK context is conceptually approached only when, in addition to m2 m1, we consider a dispersion-free state for the agent. However, this does not guarantee a prescription \u03bbt for the agent\u2019s motion, so that, strictly speaking, BK\u2019s regime is still not attained."

On the other hand, if we consider in addition that \u03c32 \u22061, so that |r\u03042\u3009 and |r\u0304\u20322\u3009 turn out to be extremely sharp Gaussian states, then we get\n\u3008e\u2212\u03b21W\u3009\u03c1TS (m1 + m2) |m1 \u2212 m2| \u0393 \u039e, (43)\nwhere \u039e \u2261 1+exp(\u2212\u03b7 2\u03932/8)\n1+exp(\u2212\u03b72/8) . In this case, the role of interference can be analyzed through \u03b7 and \u039e. Note that \u03b7 = 2\u03c32\u03b4x/~ dictates whether a spatial interference pattern is detectable for the preparation: if \u03b7 1, meaning that the distance \u03b4x between the wave packets is much greater than their width ~2\u03c32 , then no interference pattern is visible via position measurements, although the agent\u2019s initial state is a coherent superposition. In this case, one has \u039e ' 1, and the expression (43) reduces to Eq. (32), which can be shown to be the FT also when the agent state is prepared in the mixture \u03be/2. On the other hand, if \u03b7 is not too big, so that interference is observable for the agent\u2019s initial state, then \u039e becomes smaller than unit and the FT is significantly influenced by the agent\u2019s spatial coherence3. It can readily be seen from the plot of \u039e as a function of \u03b7 and m1/m2 (Fig. 2) how interference and inertia effects can be combined to maximally influence the work FT. Interference becomes most important when, to begin with, it meets the conditions to manifest itself through position measurements on the preparation (which means \u03b7 small) and when the ratio of masses comes closer to its upper bound (1+2\u03b3)\u22121, regime which is maximally far apart from the scenario of a heavy agent."

The combined effects of inertia and interference are seen to be mostly significant in the upper half plane.\nstate with center at r\u03042 = (ep, 0) and momentum uncertainty \u03c32. The parameter e \u2208 R\u22650 regulates the correlation of the receiver\u2019s momentum with the agent\u2019s position. In the limits \u03c31 \u2192 0 and \u03c32 \u2192 \u221e, the Gaussian states |0, p\u3009 and |ep, 0\u3009 approach momentum and position eigenstates, respectively, with |\u03c8e\u3009 thus representing a highly entangled state. Moreover, it can be shown that in these limits [as long as (\u03c31\u03c32)\u22121 remains bounded] the reduced matrices \u3008p\u20321|\u03c11|p1\u3009 and \u3008x\u20322|\u03c12|x2\u3009 are nearly diagonal, with respective thermal populations exp [ \u2212p21/(2\u220621) ] and exp [ \u2212x22/(2e2\u220621) ] . That is, not only \u03c11 is effectively thermal but also \u03c12 approximates a mixture of position eigenstates with Gaussian weights of mean value 0 and dispersion e\u22061.\nTo make the discussion about quantum correlations quantitative, we compute the amount of entanglement E(\u03c1e) = 1 \u2212 Tr \u03c12s encoded in \u03c1e by measuring how far the purity Tr \u03c12s of the subsystem s \u2208 {1, 2} is from unit (the maximum purity). Direct calculations lead to\nE(\u03c1e) = 1 \u2212\n\u221a\u221a 2 ( 1 + 2 + \u03d1\u22122e ) ( 1 + 2 ) ( 2 + \u03d1\u22122e\n) , (45) where \u03d1e \u2261 ~/(2e\u03c31\u03c32). It is straightforward to check that dE/de \u2265 0, with equality holding for e = 0. This shows that entanglement is a monotonic function of e, so that, modulo its dimensional unit, this parameter is itself an estimate of entanglement4. It is also interesting to note lim \u2192\u221e E(\u03c1e) = 0\n4 While E(\u03c10) = 0, one has E(\u03c1\u221e) \u2261 lime\u2192\u221e E(\u03c1e) = 1 \u2212 \u221a 2/(1 + 2),\nwhich does not reach its maximum value when e does. However, the definitive monotonicity relation, including maximum and minimum values, can be trivially established, for all , between e and the rescaled measure E(\u03c1e)/E(\u03c1\u221e).\n8 while E(\u03c1e) 1 \u2212 \u221a\n1 + \u03d12e for 1 (so that = 0 implies maximum entanglement).\nTurning to the FT, in the present case the following exact expression arises:\n\u3008e\u2212\u03b21W\u3009\u03c1e = m1 + m2\u221a M2 + 4m21\u03b3 2\n1+\u03d12e (1+ 2)\n. (46)\nIn the regime where 1, we have\n\u3008e\u2212\u03b21W\u3009\u03c1e m1 + m2\u221a\n(m1 \u2212 m2)2 \u2212 ~2\u03b221 e2(1+\u03d12e )\n. (47)\nThese results show how entanglement, via e and \u03d1e, can influence a work FT. It is interesting to assess whether purely classical correlations would also cause a similar impact. To this end, we consider the classically correlated state\n\u03c1c =\n\u222b dp e \u2212 p 2\n2\u220621\u221a 2\u03c0\u220621 G(0,p),\u03c31 \u2297G(cp,0),\u03c32 , (48)\nwhich has the same form as \u03c1c in Eq. (35) except that here the momentum of particle 1 is classically correlated with the position (instead of the momentum) of particle 2 through the parameter c \u2208 R\u22650. Just as for \u03c1e, when \u03c31 \u2192 0 and \u03c32 \u2192 \u221e with (\u03c31\u03c32)\u22121 remaining bounded, the reduced states become nearly thermal. The exact FT, for arbitrary parameters, turns out to be simply \u3008e\u2212\u03b21W\u3009\u03c1c = (m1 + m2)/M. When 1 this result can be written as\n\u3008e\u2212\u03b21W\u3009\u03c1c m1 + m2\u221a\n(m1 \u2212 m2)2 \u2212 ~2\u03b221 c2\u03d12c\n, (49)\nwhere \u03d1c \u2261 ~/(2c\u03c31\u03c32). The formal comparison with result (47) is now immediate. In particular, we see that the scenarios are comparable when \u03d1e,c 1. Also noteworthy is the fact that the relation ~\u03b21/(c\u03d1c) = 2\u03b21\u03c31\u03c32 shows that relation (49) is ~-independent and, therefore, can be claimed to be a fundamentally classical result. In any case, though, it is clear that quantum and purely classical correlations, in combination with the thermal and inertial aspects, generally have different impacts on the work FT. This difference disappears as ~\u03b21/m2 is sufficiently small, for in this regime both results (47) and (49) coalesce to the form typically found throughout this article, namely, (m1 + m2)/|m1 \u2212 m2|. Moreover, BK\u2019s formula is retrieved as m1 m2.\nBefore closing this section, two remarks are in order. First, with regard to energetics, application of Jensen\u2019s inequality allows us to write, as in the classical context, \u3008W\u3009\u03c1 \u2265 \u2212\u03b2\u221211 ln \u3008e\u2212\u03b21W\u3009\u03c1. The state of affairs is then such that, while the BK equality (2) imposes that the average work can never be negative in any time interval, here we shown that there exist processes wherein the lower bound for the average mechanical work can assume negative values. This means that, within the present perspective in which work is a Hermitian operator and the system is autonomous, a finite-mass agent can\nalso draw energy from the receiver. Such a result reveals significant deviations from the mechanical equilibrium emerging when m2 m1.\nSecond, work FTs are commonly tested by use of two-point measurement (TPM) protocols and incoherent states in the energy basis [1, 7, 29], so it is relevant to examine if and how such methods would deal with the present proposal. Usually, TPM protocols are employed to raise work statistics under the premise that work is a stochastic energy change induced by an external driving parameter \u03bbt [1, 7, 29]. This scheme enables the experimental validation of important quantum FTs (see, for instance, Refs. [1, 7, 17] and references therein) and it gives a relatively simple and fairly general way of accounting for work statistics in the quantum thermodynamics domain. It is often applied to a system S described by a timedependent Hamiltonian Hs(t) = Hs(\u03bbt). After being prepared at t = 0 in a generic state \u03c1S, the system is submitted to a projective measurement of energy at t1, thus jumping to an Hs(t1) eigenstate |en\u3009 with probability pn = \u3008en|\u03c1S|en\u3009. The system then evolves unitarily (via U\u2206t, with \u2206t = t2 \u2212 t1) until the instant t2, when a second measurement is performed and a random eigenvalue \u03b5m of Hs(t2) is obtained with probability pm|n = | \u3008\u03b5m|U\u2206t |en\u3009 |2. In this run of the experiment, work is computed as wmn = \u03b5m \u2212 en. After many runs, the work probability density \u2118w = \u2211 mn pm|n pn \u03b4D(w\u2212wmn) is built,\nwhere \u222b dw\u2118w = 1. It follows that the k-th moment of work\ncan be evaluated as wk = \u222b dw\u2118wwk = \u2211 mn pm|npnw k mn. We now examine an adaptation of this protocol to our mechanical perspective. First, it is worth noticing from Eq. (23) that the kinetic energy operator K1 of particle 1 at times 0 and v\u03c4 are such that [K1(v\u03c4),K1(0)] = 0. Therefore, it might be expected [29] that the statistics underlying the work observable W = K1(v\u03c4) \u2212 K1(0) would coincide with TPM predictions. It turns out, however, that this does not materialize for the entangled state \u03c1e, since the first measurement of a TPM protocol cancels out the quantum correlation term. To prove this point, we compute the probability density \u2118pi = [ (|pi\u3009 \u3008pi| \u2297 12) \u03c1e\n] of finding a momentum pi, and a corresponding kinetic energy p2i /2m1, in the first measurement. We find\n\u2118pi = exp\n[ \u2212 p 2 i\n2(\u220621+\u03c3 2 1) ] \u221a\n2\u03c0(\u220621 + \u03c3 2 1) . (50)\nAs soon as the first measurement is concluded, the state of the system is approximately represented by G(0,p),\u03c31 \u2297 G(cp,0),\u03c32 , with \u03c31 sufficiently small. Now, considering the same procedure for the classically correlated state \u03c1c, we find the same probability density for the first measurement, that is, Tr [ (|pi\u3009 \u3008pi| \u2297 12) \u03c1c ] = \u2118pi . Also, via state reduction, the same state G(0,p),\u03c31 \u2297G(cp,0),\u03c32 emerges after the measurement. Therefore, the probability densities related to the first measurement on \u03c1e and \u03c1c are the same and the states right after it also coincide, so that the TPM statistics resulting for \u03c1e and \u03c1c cannot be distinct. Therefore, a relation like Eq. (46) cannot be experimentally verified through a TPM protocol, even when the internal energies in the beginning and at the end commute.\n9"

            "heading": "IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS",
            "text": "Crucial to the assessment of physical systems\u2019 responses to applied perturbations, FTs allow us to analyze averages of fluctuating quantities in terms of physical aspects imposed by thermodynamic equilibrium. Studies in these lines were typically conducted under classical-like assumptions. Nevertheless, searching for the eventual effects of relaxing such constraints is vital for one to build a better comprehension of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, especially in the quantum regime.\nIn this article, we avoid classicalities in several ways. We consider (i) an exclusive work observable, (ii) a finite-mass agent, (iii) an autonomous agent-receiver dynamics, and (iv) fundamentally quantum global states which are thermal only locally. Then, we compute work FTs for specific processes and proved, by explicit examples, that the BK formula (2) cannot be extended to such regimes. Interestingly, we have been able to show that quantum agent\u2019s features such as inertia, effective temperature, quantum coherence, and quantum correlations with the receiver directly influence the work FTs. In any case, the BK formula is retrieved for very massive agents, a regime in which energy can only be delivered to the receiver and the dynamics reaches mechanical equilibrium, with the agent in uniform motion. (As shown in the Appendix, though, the recovery of BK\u2019s formula can occur in more general scenarios.) Apart from this very particular regime, our FTs show how inertia and quantum resources lead to the breakdown of the mechanical equilibrium. In fact, although our FTs are derived for specific physical processes, we believe that the dependence of FTs on inertia and quantum resources is a fundamental characteristic of any truly autonomous quantum system out of equilibrium. Finally, we show that the usually adopted TPM protocol is unable to capture the influence of entanglement on work FTs.\nIt is important to stress that the specializations made throughout this article with regard to interactions and time intervals (the physical processes) are motivated merely by analytical convenience. By principle, our mechanical approach to FTs applies to any autonomous quantum system. The key premise is that work is a quantum observable to be computed in the Heisenberg picture; everything else is just standard quantum mechanics. As a consequence, as opposed to traditional results in the field of quantum thermodynamics, the FTs emerging in autonomous contexts are expected to fundamentally depend on the features of each dynamical system under scrutiny.\nIt would be interesting to explore the work observable formalism of Ref. [58] in further autonomous processes and investigating whether some universal bound may eventually pop out. As shown here, the notion of work observable allows us to dig deeper into the extension of FTs to regimes closer to the quantum domain, specially within a fundamentally mechanical perspective. We believe that some of the predictions made here can be experimentally tested in the near future through the promising trapped ion platforms [62, 63]."

Similarly, we consider a generic agent A with energy HA and phase-space coordinate \u0393At . The composite system R + A evolves in time by means of a Hamiltonian function H = HR +VRA +HA, whereVRA is the coupling energy. The joint phase-space coordinate at time t reads \u0393t = \u0393Rt \u0393 A t . The work done by A on R during a time interval [0, t] is equal to the variation of R\u2019s internal energy [58], that is,\nW(t, 0) \u2261 W(\u03930, t) = HR(\u0393Rt (\u03930, t)) \u2212HR(\u0393R0).

To identify the part of % that codifies the correlations between the subsystems, we introduce the function C(\u03930) = %(\u03930)\u2212%R(\u0393R0)%A(\u0393A0), with %A(\u0393A0) = \u222b d\u0393R0 %(\u03930). With respect to the generic energyconserving autonomous dynamics declared so far, the following statement holds.\nResult 1. The BK equality (2) is attained in the aforementioned autonomous scenario whenever the following two conditions are satisfied simultaneously.\n10\n1. The agent\u2019s initial phase-space coordinate, \u0393A0, when written in terms of the time t coordinate, does not depend on the receiver\u2019s coordinate. Formally, this reads \u0393A0 \u2261 \u0393A0(\u0393At , t), where \u0393A0(\u0393At , t) denotes the agent\u2019s initial condition that reaches the coordinate \u0393At at time t.\n2. The correlations are such that\u222b d\u03930 e\u2212\u03b2W(\u03930,t) C(\u03930) = 0. (A3)\nProof. Assumption 2 implies that \u3008e\u2212\u03b2W(t,0)\u3009 = \u222b\nd\u03930 e\u2212\u03b2W(\u03930,t) %R(\u0393R0)%A(\u0393 A 0). (A4)\nUsing Eqs. (A1) and (A2), along with Hamiltonian invariance of the phase-space volume (d\u0393t = d\u03930), allows us to rewrite Eq. (A4) as\n\u3008e\u2212\u03b2W(t,0)\u3009 = 1Z\n\u222b d\u0393t e\u2212\u03b2HR(\u0393 R t (\u03930,t))%A[\u0393A0(\u0393t, t)]. (A5)\nAssumption 1 ensures that %A[\u0393A0(\u0393t, t)] = %A[\u0393 A 0(\u0393 A t , t)]. Since d\u0393t = d\u0393Rt d\u0393 A t , \u222b d\u0393At %A[\u0393 A 0(\u0393\nA t , t)] = 1, and\u222b\nd\u0393Rt e \u2212\u03b2HR[\u0393Rt (\u03930,t)] = \u222b d\u0393R0e \u2212\u03b2HR(\u0393R0 ) = Z, (A6)\nthen \u3008e\u2212\u03b2W(t,0)\u3009 = 1 immediately follows.\nThe above assumptions reflect two fundamental ingredients through which an autonomous dynamics can approach the regime of deterministic control upon which the BK equality was originally grounded. Assumption 1 indirectly states that the agent\u2019s degrees of freedom at a specific time t are independent of the receiver\u2019s degrees of freedom at some previous time. This embeds the idea that the agent\u2019s dynamics is barely influenced by the receiver. In other words, the agent is allowed to control and deliver energy, but it is by no means controlled. Of course, this regime is also favored when the agent is much heavier than the receiver. By its turn, assumption 2 requires that correlations must not be influential to the work exponential average. Although these are admittedly strong assumptions, they are still weaker than explicitly controlling the agent in a deterministic manner over the entire time interval. Importantly, these assumptions can be materialized in autonomous dynamics. The examples discussed in the main text (for specific time intervals and heavy agents) show that this is indeed the case, that is, the BK equality can emerge out of strictly autonomous dynamics."

From assumption 2, it follows that\n\u3008e\u2212\u03b2W(t,0)\u3009 = Tr [ e\u2212\u03b2W(t,0)\u03c1R \u2297 \u03c1A ] . (A11)\nUsing assumption 3 and Eqs. (A7) and (A8), we arrive at\nTr [ e\u2212\u03b2W(t,0)\u03c1R \u2297 \u03c1A ] =\n1 Z Tr\n[ e\u2212\u03b2HR(t)1R \u2297 \u03c1A ] . (A12)\nAssumption 1 and the cyclic property of the trace yield\nTr [ e\u2212\u03b2HR(t) Z 1R \u2297 \u03c1A ] = Tr [ e\u2212\u03b2HR Z 1R \u2297 \u03c1 \u2032\u2032 A(t) ] = 1. (A13)\nConnecting the above equations gives \u3008e\u2212\u03b2W(t,0)\u3009 = 1.\nIn both scenarios, the assumptions 1 and 2 have the same function, namely, implementing the agent\u2019s independence, a crucial characteristic of BK\u2019s approach. Assumption 3, needed only in the quantum case, circumvents the difficulties underlying the non-commutativity of the algebra. Finally, we remark that the assumptions underlying the results 1 and 2 reflect only sufficient conditions for the recovery of the BK equality. The question of whether these conditions are also necessary, or whether other conditions are relevant, remains to be investigated in future work.\n11\n[1] P. Ha\u0308nggi and P. Talkner, Nat.
