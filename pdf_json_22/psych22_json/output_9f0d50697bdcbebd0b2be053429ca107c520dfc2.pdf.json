    "abstractText": "Background: Prenatal mental health is a global health concern. Despite the far-reaching impact of prenatal mental health issues, many women do not receive the psychological care they require. Women in their childbearing years are frequent users of the internet and smartphone apps. Prenatal women are prime candidates for internet-based support for mental health care. Objective: This study aimed to examine the feasibility and acceptability of internet-based interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for prenatal women. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with women who had received internet-based IPT modules with guided support as a component of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the scale-up implementation of a digital mental health platform (The Healthy Outcomes of Pregnancy and Postpartum Experiences digital platform) for pregnant women. Qualitative thematic analysis was used to explore and describe women\u2019s experiences. Data were analyzed for emerging themes, which were identified and coded. Results: A total of 15 prenatal women were interviewed to examine their experiences and views on the feasibility and acceptability of internet-based IPT modules. Participants found the content informative and appreciated the ways in which the digital mental health platform made the IPT modules accessible to users. Participants voiced some differing requirements regarding the depth and the way information was presented and accessed on the digital mental health platform. The important areas for improvement that were identified were acknowledging greater depth and clarity of content, the need for sociability and relationships, and refinement of the digital mental health platform to a smartphone app. Conclusions: This study provides useful evidence regarding treatment format and content preferences, which may inform future development. It also provides research data on the feasibility and acceptability of web-based applications for prenatal mental health care.

Prenatal women are prime candidates for internet-based support for mental health care.\nObjective: This study aimed to examine the feasibility and acceptability of internet-based interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for prenatal women.\nMethods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with women who had received internet-based IPT modules with guided support as a component of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the scale-up implementation of a digital mental health platform (The Healthy Outcomes of Pregnancy and Postpartum Experiences digital platform) for pregnant women. Qualitative thematic analysis was used to explore and describe women\u2019s experiences. Data were analyzed for emerging themes, which were identified and coded.\nResults: A total of 15 prenatal women were interviewed to examine their experiences and views on the feasibility and acceptability of internet-based IPT modules. Participants found the content informative and appreciated the ways in which the digital mental health platform made the IPT modules accessible to users. Participants voiced some differing requirements regarding the depth and the way information was presented and accessed on the digital mental health platform. The important areas for improvement that were identified were acknowledging greater depth and clarity of content, the need for sociability and relationships, and refinement of the digital mental health platform to a smartphone app.\nConclusions: This study provides useful evidence regarding treatment format and content preferences, which may inform future development. It also provides research data on the feasibility and acceptability of web-based applications for prenatal mental health care.\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01901796; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01901796\n(JMIR Form Res 2022;6(6):e23879) doi: 10.2196/23879"

            "text": "Prenatal mental health is a global health issue, with 15% to 25% of pregnant women experiencing clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and stress [1-3]. Left untreated, prenatal psychological distress is associated with a range of negative consequences on obstetrical outcomes, maternal functioning, infant and child development, interpersonal conflict, parenting strain, and postpartum mood disorders [4-7]. Despite the far-reaching impact of prenatal mental health issues and well-established recommendations for routine mental health screening during the prenatal period, <20% of providers routinely screen [8]. Equally concerning is that only 1 in 7 prenatal women obtain the mental health intervention they require [8,9].\nInterpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is a highly effective treatment for depression and anxiety [10-12]. IPT improves symptoms of depression and anxiety in prenatal women [13-16]. Stuart and O\u2019Hara [17] suggested that IPT is a mainline treatment for prenatal mental health as it focuses on addressing 4 interpersonal problems: role transitions, interpersonal disputes, grief, and interpersonal deficits. These 4 areas address the significant factors involved in the prediction and maintenance of depression and anxiety in pregnant women. The US Preventive Task Force has identified convincing evidence that IPT is effective in treating prenatal depression [18]. Although IPT is considered an effective treatment for depressive and anxiety disorders in the prenatal period, many women are uncertain about what is considered anticipated or expected mental health experiences during pregnancy, and as such, many women are reluctant to access mental health care [10,13,19-23]. Additional barriers to access to face-to-face IPT remain a challenge because of limited IPT-trained therapists, long wait times to access care, and the high cost of therapy sessions [24,25]. As a result, there is a need to make effective IPT interventions more readily available and accessible to pregnant women.\nInternet-Based Interventions for Prenatal Mental"

In addition, internet-based interventions demonstrate preliminary effectiveness in the prevention [26,27] and treatment [28,29] of prenatal depression. Guided internet-based treatments have high levels of patient adherence and convincing reductions in mental health symptoms. They are readily available and cost-effective alternatives to face-to-face treatment [25,30]. Guided support, as a component of an internet-based treatment, has been reported in several systematic reviews to increase adherence and effectiveness for participants [31-33]. Guided support permits personal connections when needed and is a beneficial feature of internet-based interventions [34,35]."

            "text": "We developed an internet-based prenatal mental health intervention for a low-intensity, guided support IPT program for stress, anxiety, and depression. The IPT program comprises 6 modules adapted from the IPT clinician guide developed by Stuart and Robertson [36] and tailored to the specific needs of prenatal women. These IPT modules were delivered through a digital mental health platform (The Healthy Outcomes of Pregnancy and Postpartum Experiences [HOPE] digital platform). Given the model of IPT developed by Stuart and Robertson [36] as benefiting problems involving role transitions, loss, and interpersonal conflict, 6 modules were built around these 3 areas [20]. Role transitions during the prenatal and postpartum periods are primarily related to developing new skills and accommodating changing responsibilities while maintaining relationships. This problem area explores the multiple roles women juggle and the increased relationship demands because of these roles [17,36]. Women are encouraged to combine new roles rather than give up old roles, express emotions attached to each of the roles and their impact on self-esteem, and explore ambivalent feelings for each role. Ultimately, the intention of exploring role transitions is to assist women in developing a more balanced understanding of each role, modifying expectations, and assisting them in restructuring priorities [17,36].\nThe focus area of loss explores grief reactions that coincide with pregnancy and the arrival of a newborn [36]. The therapeutic intent of exploring loss is to assist with the mourning process and help women cultivate new and current relationships that can be substituted for relationships that were lost [17,36]. The focus area of interpersonal conflict is one of the most significant possible stressors during pregnancy and into the postpartum period. This often occurs in individuals and their spouses [17,36].\nThis internet-based prenatal mental health intervention comprises six 30-minute, web-based IPT modules delivered over 6 to 8 weeks. The topics of the modules are (1) identifying the important relationships in women\u2019s lives, (2) understanding and improving communication patterns, (3) navigating interpersonal disputes, (4) adapting to role transitions, (5) working through grief and loss, and (6) maintaining IPT strategies and carrying these skills forward in their lives after the study ends. These topics were tailored to pregnant women. Participants were asked to complete specific assignments on the web for each module, such as self-awareness homework and exploring relationships with those close to them. The goals of the intervention included symptom relief, improving interpersonal functioning and relationships, changing expectations about interpersonal relationships, and improving social support networks. Participants were guided to recognize and disengage from unhelpful communication patterns and foster strategies for developing and nurturing social support in navigating challenging times, such as role transitions, conflict with their partner or extended family members, and grief or loss.\nJMIR Form Res 2022 | vol. 6 | iss. 6 | e23879 | p. 2https://formative.jmir.org/2022/6/e23879 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nWithin this program, women were encouraged to assess their expectations for roles that they, their partners, parents, in-laws, and other children have during the prenatal period. Within these expectations, women explore the changes and consistency of roles before, during, and after pregnancy into the postpartum period. A significant aspect of the focus area of interpersonal conflict includes the identification of disputes and the development of problem-solving approaches that women can put into action. In addition, this IPT module contained the following components: development of a support system, effective communication strategies, and skills for managing conflict in relationships [36]. Homework exercises involved assessing attachment style; communication style; breaking down a distressing conversation or interaction; understanding one\u2019s relationships through relationship circles; visualizing, describing, and resolving conflict through a disagreement or dispute graph; and understanding role transitions through a life events timeline. Women were assessed for the areas of life challenges that caused emotional distress. This provided a targeted direction regarding modules that best suited their needs (eg, loss, transition, and interpersonal).\nThe IPT internet-based prenatal mental health intervention, comprising 6 IPT modules, was a component of a randomized controlled trial that evaluated the scale-up of a digital mental health platform for pregnant women\u2014the HOPE digital mental health platform.\nThis study aimed to investigate women\u2019s views of the feasibility and acceptability of IPT internet-based prenatal mental health modules delivered through a digital mental health platform with low-intensity, guided support."

Recruitment continued during data analysis to achieve saturation of the themes. All interviews were conducted over the phone, audio recorded, and conducted by the first author (KSB; she or her), an experienced qualitative research interviewer, as a part of her doctoral dissertation and transcribed verbatim.

The themes that concurrently emerged from these interviews were relevant to the aim of our study and our research questions. A coding framework was developed in response to the themes that emerged during each interview. This coding framework was reviewed and refined as it was applied to data. Patterns within and across themes were explored using an analysis process. The main coding categories paralleled the questions asked during the interviews. Categories were also reflective of emerging trends in the data, which became apparent from the frequency of certain categories and repetition of points. Agreement on the categories and concepts was sought between members of the research team to ensure reliability. The interviews and coding framework were examined until no new information emerged from the data. KB, who has a background in qualitative interviewing, conducted the interviews and was the lead in the data analysis. LM and DEK, who have backgrounds in psychology, mental health, and the prenatal population, each read 5 interview transcripts. The coding framework was discussed throughout its development, with regular meetings between the 3 researchers to ensure that the concepts were appropriately identified and described.\nJMIR Form Res 2022 | vol. 6 | iss. 6 | e23879 | p. 3https://formative.jmir.org/2022/6/e23879 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX"

And I think that is a big reason why I wasn\u2019t able understand what I could take from what is going on in my life right now and to be able to implement it to complete the exercise. I needed a better understanding of what the homework was asking because I wasn\u2019t understanding what it was asking. [P7]\nI think that if the app could have it so you could do a lot of the exercises in real time so actually inputting\nyour thoughts and your data into app and it could organize it for you. I think that would make it a lot more attractive to the user. [P9]\nI think clearly outlining what is available on this Web-App from the beginning would help like the surveys, the modules, the mood tracker, and things like that.

Like there is so much on YouTube and TedTalks to find helpful, like Bren\u00e9 Brown or something cool like that would be something for interpersonal relationships and vulnerability...It is about catering to different learning styles. [P2]\nI am a very visual learner so having videos instead of a lot of reading would have been more helpful for me. [P7]\nI used multiple apps during my pregnancy it would have been nice to have one that tracks where I am in my pregnancy and mental health to see if they could\nJMIR Form Res 2022 | vol. 6 | iss. 6 | e23879 | p. 6https://formative.jmir.org/2022/6/e23879 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nbe linked or incorporated into one app would be something that I would be interested in. [P8]\nHaving the modules as an audio, like something I could listen to while driving, might be helpful. [P15]\nIn addition, the participants suggested embedding mental health into a pregnancy app to include mental health as a part of overall health:\nI think it would be helpful to integrate this app into a pregnancy app, like all of us had the bump app, and it kind of goes through some of the physical changes in pregnancy and I think people are kind of curious about that the baby is doing and what their bodies are doing, so that might be nice to tie together. That is more holistic too. So, showing people that mental health is just health. [P6]\nIn addition, there was a suggestion to extend the IPT work into the postpartum period with modules aimed at the challenges of being a new parent:\nI think it would be helpful to have additional modules to work through in the postpartum period. Like navigating yourself, your new baby, and your relationship with your partner in the postpartum period. [P12]\nOverall, the participants found the HOPE digital mental health platform and IPT modules helpful in managing their mental health concerns during pregnancy. They also had many suggestions to further improve the HOPE digital mental health platform and IPT modules. These women suggested that the platform and modules could attend to a variety of learning styles, including the use of videos and audio components. In addition, the participants wanted this mental health component to be integrated into existing pregnancy apps as part of comprehensive prenatal and postpartum care."

            "text": "This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a pilot study of internet-based IPT modules. Regarding the feasibility of the study, participants reported that the features of the internet-based IPT modules delivered via the digital mental health platform (the HOPE digital platform) were easily integrated into their lives. Of the 15 participants, 10 (66%) were described as high users of the modules, completing >4 of the 8 modules. The internet-based delivery of the IPT modules permitted flexible and independent access. Participants appreciated being able to seek support and resources to self-manage the emotional or mental health challenges arising during their pregnancies.\nParticipants reported that the format of the digital mental health platform was acceptable and user-friendly. They also reported that the digital mental health platform could be improved by delivering the format through a smartphone app. Among the women who accessed the internet-based IPT, the treatment was considered generally useful and helpful in examining communication and interactions with others. Many women\nreported that the modules were helpful in solving concrete problems. Although described as useful, there were elements of the modules that the participants felt could be improved. Some considered the information to be too basic and required further refinement. They also sought improvement in the depth and breadth of content and clarity of instructions for exercises and homework. In addition, the participants suggested that they would benefit from additional directions on what they needed to do when not managing well.\nParticipants reported that they appreciated the guided support or coach aspect of the internet-based IPT modules and digital mental health platform. Whether the coach was triggered in the digital mental health platform to contact women (based on responses to survey questionnaires) or the women requested a coach callback, the guided support or coach gave women the feeling that they were being checked in on. They valued having the coach see how they were doing. Participants reported that this was one of the most important aspects of the IPT modules and digital mental health platform."

            "text": "This study found that an internet-based mental health intervention was feasible, with participants citing the ease and flexibility of access as beneficial. These results are consistent with previous studies [42-45]. As mentioned by the participants in this study, a smartphone app is preferred over the delivery of interventions with a web application. Previous studies have also reported an increase in treatment accessibility and participation in mental health interventions when delivered via smartphone apps [46]. Furthermore, internet-based and smartphone apps provide convenient and potentially anonymous access to treatment. Smartphone apps can also overcome conventional barriers to seeking help, including lack of time, stigma, childcare issues, and embarrassment [47-49].\nThe efficacy of internet-based interventions is well-established for various mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and stress [25,50,51]. Acceptability of internet-based interventions has been reported across different populations, including students [52], perinatal women [53], and older adults [54].\nThis study adds to the evidence that pregnant women seek resources and support to self-manage mild to moderate mental health concerns [55]. Consistent with previous studies, the preference of women to address mental health problems on their own highlights the need and opportunity to offer alternatives to traditional face-to-face, therapist-led interventions [56-58]. Providing prenatal women with effective resources and support to self-manage their mild to moderate mental health concerns, including internet-based therapy, may be an effective approach for pregnant women with mild to moderate mental health concerns.\nThis study was unique in that mental health symptoms may impact engagement in the digital mental health platform. Participants in this study reported that they were less inclined to access the web application platform when they were doing very well and when they were struggling with significant psychological distress. This finding seems to contradict the\nJMIR Form Res 2022 | vol. 6 | iss. 6 | e23879 | p. 7https://formative.jmir.org/2022/6/e23879 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nfindings that mental health symptoms had no relationship with a preference for and engagement in web-based mental health programs [59,60]. These studies indicate that neither high nor low symptoms of depression and anxiety caused individuals to be more or less likely to engage in web-based mental health interventions.\nGuided support is a beneficial feature of internet-based interventions; this preference for person-to-person support is consistent with previous work [34,35]. However, evidence regarding the nature of guided support is lacking. The use of face-to-face or person-to-person mental health programs is slightly preferred for those experiencing emotional and personal problems [61-64]. Predictors for the preference of person-to-person mental health interventions included currently experiencing emotional or personal problems. The use of coach-based guided support along with mental health apps for smartphones has been found to improve mental and emotional health by decreasing participants\u2019 depression, anxiety, and general distress [46,65-67]. Guided support or coaching with internet-based mental health interventions has been reported to be an effective, cost-efficient, and acceptable alternative to face-to-face therapy [33]. Systematic reviews exploring the internet-based mental health interventions found that offering some form of support or guidance during the web-based treatment increased the effectiveness and was associated with higher levels of program completion [34,68]. Findings from this study will help move this area of study forward by identifying the importance of coach-based guided support within a pregnant population. This study may lead to an increase in the refinement of smartphone delivery of IPT in pregnant women."

            "heading": "Limitations",
            "text": "The findings of the usability, feasibility, and acceptability of internet-based IPTs are limited to the experiences and perspectives of a small sample. None of the women who\nwithdrew from the study before completing the first module reported reasons for dropping out of the program.\nThe research team took several actions to minimize the likelihood of bias during the analysis phase. The research team had regular discussions about the coding framework with fellow team members who each reviewed 5 interviews to ensure that the concepts were being appropriately identified and described.\nParticipants who agreed to be interviewed were offered a small monetary compensation for their time, which may have affected their responses.\nAnother limitation may be the generalizability of these findings because of the smaller prenatal sample size.\nClinical Implications This study provides insights into the acceptability of this internet-based IPT program for prenatal women. This information could be used to further refine the development of targeted IPT mental health support for women during their pregnancy and into the postpartum period. Smartphone app development is required for the delivery of IPT programs. This will support women during their pregnancy and into the postpartum period. Future smartphone IPT programs aimed at prenatal women would also benefit from guided or coach support components."

The current format of this internet-based IPT needs refinement. This study revealed the strengths and weaknesses of the content and format of this internet-based IPT. In addition, the study participants highlighted potential areas of improvement. The IPT modules for women during the prenatal period would benefit from the further refinement of the content and integration of the revised modules into a randomized controlled trial to explore the efficacy of the internet-based IPT modules on perinatal mental health concerns."
