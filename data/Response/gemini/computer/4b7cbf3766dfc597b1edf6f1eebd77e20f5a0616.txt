1. **Investigate the impact of the proposed waiting list procedure on student satisfaction and academic performance.** This could be done by conducting a survey of students who have participated in the new procedure, or by comparing the academic performance of students who participated in the new procedure to the performance of students who participated in the old procedure.


2. **Explore the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to automate the waiting list selection process.** This could help to reduce the time and resources required to manage waiting lists, and it could also help to ensure that students are selected for courses in a fair and equitable manner.


3. **Develop a system for tracking and monitoring waiting lists.** This system could be used to identify courses that are consistently oversubscribed, and it could also be used to track the progress of students who are on waiting lists. This information could be used to improve the waiting list procedure and to ensure that all students have a fair chance of getting into the courses they want.


4. **Conduct a comparative study of waiting list procedures in different educational institutions.** This study could help to identify best practices for waiting list management, and it could also help to inform the development of new waiting list procedures.


5. **Investigate the use of waiting lists in other contexts, such as healthcare or housing.** This research could help to identify new ways to use waiting lists to improve the allocation of resources and to ensure that people have access to the services they need.
