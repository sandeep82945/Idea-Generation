 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming:

1. Examine the impact of governmental restrictions on investor risk perception in other commercial property types like office and industrial real estate. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted different property types in unique ways that could influence investor risk perceptions.

2. Investigate whether the political affiliation of individual investors impacts their risk perceptions and investment decisions. The paper currently looks at state-level factors but micro-level data could provide additional insights. 

3. Analyze how diversity along other dimensions like age, income, education level etc. influences commercial real estate investment risk. The paper finds racial-ethnic diversity reduces risk but other factors could also play a role.

4. Study the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial real estate investment risk premiums. The paper looks at short-term effects but it would be interesting to see if heightened risk perceptions persist. 

5. Examine how local politics and political attitudes in cities/counties within a state influence commercial real estate investment risk. The state-level factors are important but local politics could also contribute to risk perceptions.
