    "abstractText": "While research has widely explored stress, coping, and quality of life (QOL) individually and the potential links between them, a critical dearth exists in the literature regarding these constructs in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study aims to identify the salient stressors experienced, describe the coping strategies used, and examine the relationships between stressors, coping, and QOL among individuals during the pandemic. Data are from a sample of 1,004 respondents who completed an online survey. Key measures included stressful life events (SLEs), coping strategies, and the physical and psychological health domains of QOL. Staged multivariate linear regression analyses examined the relationships between SLEs and the two QOL domains, controlling for sociodemographic and pre-existing health conditions and testing for the effects of coping strategies on these relationships. The most common SLEs experienced during the pandemic were a decrease in financial status, personal injury or illness, and change in living conditions. Problem-focused coping (\u03b2 = 0.42, \u03c3 = 0.13, p < 0.001 for physical QOL; \u03b2 = 0.57, \u03c3 = 0.12, p < 0.001 for psychological QOL) and emotion-focused coping (\u03b2 = 0.86, \u03c3 = 0.13, p < 0.001 for psychological QOL) were significantly related to higher levels of QOL, whereas avoidant coping (\u03b2 = \u20130.93, \u03c3 = 0.13, p < 0.001 for physical QOL; \u03b2 = -1.33, \u03c3 = 0.12, p < 0.001 for psychological QOL) was associated with lower QOL. Avoidant coping partially mediated the relationships between experiencing SLEs and lower physical and psychological QOL. Our study informs clinical interventions to help individuals adopt healthy behaviors to effectively manage stressors, especially large-scale, stressful events like the pandemic. Our findings also call for public health and clinical interventions to address the long-term impacts of the most prevalent stressors experienced during the pandemic among vulnerable groups.",

Experiencing stressful life events (SLEs) has also been significantly associated with reduced quality of life (QOL) in a wide range of vulnerable populations, including racial and ethnic minorities [10], elderly persons [11\u201313], chronically ill patients [14\u201316], and children [17,18]. Specifically, SLEs have been found to be inversely associated with physical QOL [13,16] and psychological QOL [16].\nThe World Health Organization [19] defines quality of life (QOL) as \u201cindividuals\u2019 perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live, and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns\u201d (p.1405). Some research has indicated that individuals experienced lower QOL during the pandemic. For example, stressors, such as loss of income, personal health effects, social isolation, and COVID-19 diagnosis, were negatively correlated with QOL during the pandemic [20]. Further, a study [21] in Germany found that the pandemic did not affect the QOL of individuals equally, with women, job seekers, and younger people reporting a significantly lower QOL. This study also indicated an overall decline in reported physical and psychological QOL during the pandemic [21].\nIndividuals cope with stressors in various ways. Three coping strategies widely investigated\nin the literature include problem-focused coping, emotion-focused focusing, and avoidant coping. Each of these strategies entails different methods for dealing with SLEs. Problemfocused coping involves stress-reducing tactics such as problem-solving, obtaining instrumental support, and planning [22,23]. Emotion-focused coping strategies include the use of emotional support, humor, religion, and positive reframing [22,23]. Avoidant coping involves behaviors such as substance use, distractions, and behavioral disengagement [24]. The literature has demonstrated that problem-focused coping is the most effective in stressful situations because it entails taking control of the stressor and using proactive methods to address it [23]. On the other hand, emotion-focused coping has been shown to be most effective when the stressor, such as a death of a loved one, is outside of one\u2019s control [23,25]. Avoidant coping may be the least effective and most harmful because it not only does not remove the stressor but also likely worsens existing stress, anxiety, and depression [26\u201328].\nThere is limited information about the role of coping strategies in the relationships\nbetween SLEs and QOL. In a study by Merluzzi et al. [15], disengagement/denial coping, which is a form of avoidant coping, mediated the associations between SLEs and emotion QOL and physical/functional QOL among cancer patients. Inconsistent findings exist regarding the relationships between SLEs, coping strategies, and other outcomes such as depression, anxiety, life satisfaction, loneliness, and distress. In a 20-year longitudinal study among high-school students in Canada, Pelekanakis et al. [29] found that problem-focused coping moderated, but did not mediate, the association between SLEs and depressive symptoms in that this association was lower among individuals who employed problem-focused coping. Conversely, emotion-focused coping both mediated and moderated the relationship between SLEs and depressive symptoms, such that SLEs were positively associated with emotion-focused coping, which was then positively associated with depressive symptomatology; additionally, the relationship between SLEs and depressive symptoms was stronger among those who used emotion-focused coping. The study did not demonstrate a mediating or moderating effect for avoidant coping. However, avoidant coping was found to moderate the relationships between SLEs and depression, anxiety, and life satisfaction among college students during the pandemic [30]. Conversely, avoidant coping has been shown to mediate the associations between SLEs and cancer-related distress [31], as well as depression, anxiety, and loneliness [32].\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277741 May 10, 2023 2 / 18\nFurther, though several studies have captured how frequently various coping strategies\nwere used during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is limited research on the relationships between coping strategies and QOL during this time period. A large-scale study [33] in the United Kingdom found that emotion-focused coping strategies were more likely to be used when individuals experienced financial stressors (i.e., their or their partner\u2019s loss of employment or inability to work, decrease in household income) or worries about contracting or becoming severely sick from COVID-19 and that both problem-focused coping and avoidant coping strategies were likely to be employed when respondents reported adverse financial events as well as worries about finances, basic needs, or contracting COVID-19. In terms of potential links between coping and QOL during the pandemic, research [34] has shown that for patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the use of problem-focused coping mechanisms had a direct and positive correlation with their QOL. Additionally, Quiroga-Garza et al. [35] found that problem-focused and emotion-focused coping were marginally, but significantly, correlated with well-being. Further, Shamblaw et al. [28] found that approach coping, which entails more proactive aspects of problem-focused and emotion-focused coping (e.g., planning, positive reframing, and use of emotional support), was associated with higher QOL, whereas avoidant coping was related to significantly lower QOL during the pandemic.\nWhile researchers have widely explored stress, coping, and QOL individually, as well as\npotential links between them, there is a critical dearth in the literature regarding these constructs in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the pandemic had far-reaching and multidimensional health impacts on the population, it provided a unique opportunity to investigate how individuals cope with stressors during a relatively brief period of time and how different coping strategies may have differential impacts on individuals\u2019 QOL. Our study uses a nationwide sample of over 1000 U.S. adults to 1) Identify the salient stressors reported by individuals during the pandemic; 2) Describe the types of coping strategies used by individuals during the pandemic; and 3) Examine the relationships between stressors, coping, and QOL among individuals during the pandemic. Based on findings in the extant coping literature, we hypothesize that problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping during the pandemic were positively associated with QOL. Further, we predict that experiencing SLEs was positively related to the use of avoidant coping, which, in turn, was negatively associated with QOL."

            "text": "Quality of life. QOL was measured using the World Health Organization Quality of Life\nAbbreviated Version (WHOQOL-BREF) instrument [36]. This 26-item measure asks the respondent to indicate how often or how completely certain experiences relating to general QOL and various dimensions of QOL, including physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environmental health, occurred in the past four weeks using 5-point Likert scale responses (1 = \u201cnot at all\u201d or never\u201d; 5 = \u201can extreme amount,\u201d \u201ccompletely,\u201d or \u201calways\u201d). Scores were summed for each QOL dimension, with higher scores indicating higher levels of QOL. Scores for each QOL dimension were then rescaled to range from 0\u2013100, per the instrument\u2019s scoring instructions. In this analysis, we focused on the dimensions of physical health (7 items) and psychological health (6 items), as these dimensions measured perceptions regarding more internal experiences of health, as opposed to experiences with external factors such as social relationships and environmental situations. The physical and psychological health measures (\u03b1 = 0.82 for both) had good internal consistency (Table 1). Stressors. Stressors were measured using a modified version of the Holmes and Rahe Rating Scale [37], in which we asked respondents if they experienced any of the following 21 stressful life events (SLEs) during the pandemic: Death of spouse/partner, child, close family member, or close friend; personal injury or illness; domestic violence in the home; injury or illness in a child or other family member(s); divorce; separation from partner; imprisonment; loss of employment; loss of employment of spouse/partner; loss of educational opportunity; pregnancy; pregnancy of spouse/partner; childbirth; childbirth by spouse/partner; decrease in financial status; need to cut the size meals or skip meals because there wasn\u2019t enough money for food; homelessness; foreclosure of mortgage or loan; eviction; change in living conditions; and increase in the frequency of arguments at home or work. Respondents were asked to mark all that applied, and we used the following categories of responses in our analyses: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4+ SLEs. We also examined the individual effects of each SLE in our multivariate regression models. SLEs were not operationalized as a composite score because over half of the respondents reported not experiencing any SLEs during the pandemic, and the distribution of the composite measure was wide. Further, due to the skew in the SLE count distribution (i.e., 352 individuals experiencing no SLEs, 236 experiencing one SLE, 161 experiencing two SLEs, 113 experiencing three SLEs, 65 experiencing four SLEs, and 77 experiencing 5+ SLEs), we decided to truncate the operationalization of the SLE measure at 4+ SLEs in order to ensure a more even distribution among the SLE categories (i.e., 35%, 24%, 16%, 11%, and 14% of sample reporting 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4+ SLEs, respectively). Other research [38\u201340] examining SLEs has utilized this approach.\nCoping. Coping style was measured using a 16-item version of Carver\u2019s Brief COPE mea-\nsure [24]. Dias et al. [41] grouped the Brief COPE items into three coping styles: problem-\n*p<0.05.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277741.t001\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277741 May 10, 2023 4 / 18\nfocused coping, emotion-focused coping, and avoidant coping. In our survey, individuals were asked to indicate, using 5-point Likert scale responses (1 = \u201cI haven\u2019t been doing this a lot\u201d; 5 = \u201cI have been doing this a lot\u201d), how they coped with stressors over the past year. Problemfocused coping included four items relating to active coping and the use of informational support. Emotion-focused coping included six items pertaining to emotional support, humor, and religion. Avoidant coping had six items relating to self-distraction, substance use, and behavioral disengagement. Scores for each coping strategy were summed, with higher scores reflecting greater use of that strategy. We rescaled the problem-focused coping scores to be out of 24 points to compare our findings more easily regarding different coping styles. The problemfocused, emotion-focused, and avoidant coping measures had acceptable internal consistencies with Cronbach alphas of 0.78, 0.67, and 0.75, respectively (Table 1).\nSociodemographic variables. The following sociodemographic variables were included\nin the analyses: race/ethnicity, gender identity, annual household income, age, and marital status.\nRace/ethnicity categories included American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian; Black or Afri-\ncan American; Hispanic, Latino or Spanish Origin; Middle Eastern or North African; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; White; other; and prefer not to say. Due to their low frequencies in our sample, we categorized American Indian or Alaska Native, Middle Eastern or North African, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and Other as \u201cOther Race/ethnicity\u201d for the analyses.\nWe included the following gender identity categories in the survey: cisgender male; cisgen-\nder female; transgender male; transgender female; non-binary/gender non-conforming; do not identify as female, male, or transgender; and prefer not to say. Our analysis grouped transgender, non-binary/gender non-conforming, and non-identifying individuals as \u201cother gender identity\u201d due to their low frequencies in the sample.\nAnnual household income was operationalized as the following categories: Less than\n$25,000; $25,000-$34,999; $35,000- $49,999; $50,000-$74,999; $75,000-$99,999; $100,000- $149,999; $150,000-$199,999; greater than or equal to $200,000; and prefer not to say. The analysis grouped individuals with annual household incomes of $150,000 to $199,999 and $200,000 or more due to their smaller frequencies.\nAge was a continuous variable that was provided as an open-ended response. Marital status categories included: single/never married; married; not married, but in a rela-\ntionship and living with your partner; not married, but in a relationship and not living with your partner; separated; divorced; widowed; and other.\nPre-existing health conditions. Pre-existing health conditions that were included in the\nanalyses were having a chronic physical condition, mental health condition, or disability.\nChronic physical health condition was operationalized as a dichotomous variable (i.e., any versus none) indicating whether the respondent reported being diagnosed with at least one of the following chronic illnesses: Multiple sclerosis; high blood pressure; COPD; diabetes; heart disease (heart failure, aFib, etc.); cancer; autoimmune (Psoriatic disease, Crohn\u2019s/Ulcerative Colitis, etc.); asthma; rheumatoid arthritis; and other.\nMental health condition was a dichotomous variable (any versus none); conditions\nincluded the following: Mood disorder (e.g., depression, bipolar disorder, etc.); anxiety disorder (e.g., obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, phobias, etc.); eating disorder (e.g., anorexia, bulimia, etc.); Post-traumatic Stress Disorder; and other.\nDisability was operationalized as a dichotomous variable (any versus none) indicating if the\nrespondent reported being diagnosed with any of the following disabilities: Sensory impairment (vision or hearing); mobility impairment; learning disability (e.g., ADHD, dyslexia); and other.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277741 May 10, 2023 5 / 18"

No consistently identifiable pattern emerged with coping strategies; individuals who had an income between $25,000 and $35,000 reported the lowest scores for all three types of coping, and individuals who had an income of $100,000-$150,000 generally reported the highest scores for all three types of coping.

Table 3 displays the statistically significant covariates in each of the models for which the QOL physical health dimension was the outcome variable. Based on the final model (model 6), experiencing a greater number of SLEs was associated with increasingly lower QOL physical health (\u03b2 = -4.94, \u03c3 = 1.72, p = 0.004 for 2 SLEs; \u03b2 = -7.98, \u03c3 = 1.96, p<0.001 for 3 SLEs; and \u03b2 = -8.67, \u03c3 = 1.86, p< 0.001 for 4+ SLEs. After adjusting for all other covariates, problem-focused coping was positively associated with QOL physical health (\u03b2 = 0.42, \u03c3 = 0.13, p< 0.001), whereas avoidant coping was negatively associated with this outcome (\u03b2 = -0.93, \u03c3 = 0.13, p< 0.001). Other significant covariates that were associated with significantly lower QOL physical health included \u201cother\u201d race/ethnicity (\u03b2 = -10.64, \u03c3 = 5.07, p = 0.04), having an annual household income between $25,000-$34,999 (\u03b2 = -6.84, \u03c3 = 2.49, p = 0.006), and having a chronic physical health condition (\u03b2 = -6.77, \u03c3 = 1.22, p< 0.001), mental health condition (\u03b2 = -6.20, \u03c3 = 1.21, p< 0.001), or disability (\u03b2 = -7.61, \u03c3 = 1.41, p< 0.001).\nFurther, as shown in Table 3, we investigated if each coping strategy potentially mediated the relationships between SLEs and QOL physical health. The final model revealed that only avoidant coping is a potential partial mediator in the relationships between the QOL physical\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277741 May 10, 2023 11 / 18\nhealth dimension and experiencing 2, 3, and 4+ SLEs, with reductions in the SLE coefficients with the inclusion of avoidant coping. Fig 2A illustrates the partial mediation model for the relationship between experiencing 4+ SLEs, avoidant coping, and QOL physical health. Sensitivity analysis through Sobel tests confirmed that avoidant coping partially mediated the relationships between experiencing 2, 3, and 4+ SLEs and QOL physical health.\nTable 4 shows the staged linear regression models for the relationships between SLEs and\nthe QOL psychological health dimension. In the final model, both problem-focused coping (\u03b2 = 0.57, \u03c3 = 0.12, p< 0.001) and emotion-focused coping (\u03b2 = 0.86, \u03c3 = 0.13, p< 0.001) were positively associated with QOL psychological health, while avoidant coping (\u03b2 = -1.33, \u03c3 = 0.12, p< 0.001) was negatively associated with QOL psychological health.

On the other hand, increasing age had a small, positive association (\u03b2 = 0.21, \u03c3 = 0.04, p<0.001) with QOL psychological health. Further, in the final model, experiencing 2 SLEs (\u03b2 = -8.87, \u03c3 = 1.66, p<0.001) predicted the highest reduction in the coefficient for QOL psychological health, followed by experiencing 3 SLEs (\u03b2 = -7.72, \u03c3 = 1.90, p<0.001), 4+ SLEs (\u03b2 = -6.60, \u03c3 = 1.80, p<0.001), and 1 SLE (\u03b2 = -3.52, \u03c3 = 1.42, p = 0.01).\nAgain, we tested potential mediation by each coping strategy in the relationships between SLEs and QOL psychological health and found that avoidant coping partially mediated these relationships, with reductions in the SLE coefficients. The partial mediation model for the relationship between experiencing 4+ SLEs, avoidant coping, and QOL psychological health is shown in Fig 2B.

            "text": "This study contributes to the emerging literature on the psychological impacts of the COVID19 pandemic by shedding light on individuals\u2019 experiences of SLEs, utilization of various coping strategies, and current QOL during this traumatic global event. Our findings indicate that the most common SLEs experienced during the pandemic were a decrease in financial status, personal injury or illness, and change in living conditions. We also found that, on average, respondents reported higher levels of problem-focused coping, followed by emotion-focused coping and avoidant coping. Further, our findings support our hypothesis that problemfocused coping and emotion-focused coping were significantly related to higher levels of QOL, whereas avoidant coping was associated with lower QOL. Importantly, consistent with our hypothesis, our study revealed that avoidant coping partially mediated the relationship between experiencing SLEs and lower physical and psychological QOL.\nStudies have reported conflicting findings regarding the most prevalent SLEs experienced\nby individuals during the pandemic. A U.S.-based qualitative study by Jean-Baptiste et al. [45] found that the death of a loved one was the most common stressor experienced by respondents, followed by racism, discrimination including implicit bias and stereotyping, financial hardship and economic crisis, and personal health issues. On the other hand, a cross-sectional study conducted [46] in Iran found that the most prevalent stressor was the rise in essential good prices and that personal illness (i.e., being diagnosed with COVID-19) and the death of a loved one were ranked on the bottom of the list. Overall, our finding that experiencing financial difficulties and personal injury or illness were the most commonly experienced SLEs during the pandemic is consistent with this extant research.\nOur findings corroborate existing literature indicating the positive association between the\nuse of problem-focused coping and QOL pre-pandemic [47\u201349] and during the pandemic [28,34,35]. On the other hand, previous research, most of which was conducted pre-pandemic, has demonstrated inconsistent findings regarding the relationship between emotion-focused coping and QOL, with many studies pointing to a negative association between these two constructs [47,49,50]. A study conducted during the pandemic by Shamblaw et al. [28], however, has suggested that some emotion-focused coping strategies, such as the use of emotional support, may be related to well-being. As the pandemic instigated or exacerbated a wide range of unexpected and unpredictable stressors, such as personal illness, illness and deaths of loved ones, and unemployment, we posit that the use of emotion-focused coping was likely helpful in navigating these situations. Further, our findings regarding the inverse link between the use of avoidant coping strategies and QOL is supported by most pre-pandemic and pandemicrelated literature [15,28,47,51,52].\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277741 May 10, 2023 13 / 18\nImportantly, our study found that avoidant coping mediated the relationship between SLEs\nand lower QOL during the pandemic. Previous research has revealed similar findings in other contexts. Merluzzi et al. [15] discovered that the avoidant coping strategy of disengagement/ denial coping mediated the associations between SLEs and emotion QOL and physical/functional QOL among cancer patients. Similarly, in a study by Langford et al. [31], disengagement coping mediated the association between SLEs and cancer-related distress. Further, Minahan et al. [32] found that avoidant coping mediated the relationships between pandemic-related stress and psychological outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and loneliness. However, to our knowledge, our study is the first to indicate that avoidant coping partially mediates the relationship between SLEs and QOL during the pandemic.\nOur study\u2019s findings have important clinical and public health implications. Greater expo-\nsure to stressors was linked with avoidant coping strategies, which were, in turn, associated with significantly lower QOL. Therefore, it is essential that mental healthcare and primary care providers dissuade the use of avoidant coping among patients, particularly those who experience elevated levels of stress. Alternatively, clinicians should promote the use of problemfocused coping, in general, to decrease the severity of stressors and the use of emotion-focused coping strategies when addressing uncontrollable or unpredictable stressors, such as largescale traumatic events. Our study also highlights the most prevalent SLEs experienced during the pandemic. Hence, these findings call for public health and clinical interventions to address the long-term impacts of these stressors post-pandemic, especially among vulnerable groups such as racial/ethnic and gender minorities, cisgender women, lower-income individuals, unmarried individuals, and those with a chronic physical health condition, mental health condition, or disability.\nOur study has some limitations that should be considered when interpreting its findings.\nFirst, as the survey was conducted in August 2021 and inquired about events that occurred over the time period of 17 months (since the lockdown in March 2020), responses may have been vulnerable to recall bias. Second, as this study was cross-sectional, causality cannot be assumed in the relationships between SLEs, coping strategies, and QOL, and mediation analysis is not ideal when the temporal relationships between these variables have not been established. However, though respondents were asked to report on SLEs experienced and coping strategies used during the pandemic, responses regarding QOL inquired about current (i.e., in the past month) perceptions and feelings. Third, we acknowledge that our observations about SLEs, coping strategies, and QOL experienced during the pandemic are not necessarily specific to the pandemic; for example, financial stressors are likely a prevailing stressor for many individuals and that avoidant coping is likely associated with the experience of more stressful life events and lower QOL, regardless of the pandemic. However, we contend that the pandemic provided an opportunity to examine these trends during a period of heightened global stress, and we were also able to discern the stressors that were likely more prevalent during the pandemic, such as personal illness and change in living conditions. Fourth, though Prolific creates nationally representative samples based on age, sex, and ethnicity data from the U.S. Census Bureau, our sample was not representative of the U.S. population in terms of ethnicity, thereby partially limiting the generalization of our findings to the U.S. population.\nDespite these potential limitations, our study has critical implications for future research\ndirections. Longitudinal research is needed to explore temporal relationships between the previous experience of SLEs, subsequent coping strategies that are employed, and current QOL. Further, as previous research has suggested that social support may act as a moderator in the relationship between stressors and QOL [53,54], researchers should consider the roles of social support and sense of community in the relationships between SLEs, coping strategies, and QOL, including the social relationships dimension of QOL, during global stressors such as the\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277741 May 10, 2023 14 / 18\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Along these lines, traumatic events have been shown to lead not only to stress but also to posttraumatic growth [55]. Therefore, future research should explore the development of both posttraumatic stress and growth after the pandemic, as well as their relationships with coping strategies and QOL."
