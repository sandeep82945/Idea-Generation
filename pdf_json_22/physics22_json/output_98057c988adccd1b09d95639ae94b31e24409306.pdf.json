    "abstractText": "Received: 16 September 2022 Accepted: 16 October 2022 Some of the important critical parameters for assessing the water quality like pH (Hydrogen ion concentration), DO (Dissolved Oxygen), BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand), etc., were monitored at different locations in some major Indian rivers. The results obtained from the study reveals that the critical parameters had increasing values in some monitoring locations, decreasing values, and no variation in values at some other places. It is recommended to have a pH value above 7, higher values of DO, lower values of BOD & FCC (Faecal Coliform Content) for improved water quality. Overall, the water quality improved in most Indian rivers. There was no discharge of industrial wastes, hotels/restaurants wastes, immersing of idols during religious festivals, etc., to the rivers during the COVID-19 lockdown. Therefore, enforcement of strict regulations by the Government of India for disposal of wastes produced from industrial & domestic activities can significantly reduce the water pollution levels in the Indian rivers.",

            "text": "COVID-19 stands for Corona Virus Infectious Disease, whose year of occurrence is 2019. It is caused by the pathogen Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARSCOV-2) belonging to the \u03b2-subgroup of the Corona virus family. The disease was first diagnosed in Wuhan city, Hubei province of China, which later spread its tentacles to over 220 countries and territories around the world. The Government of India imposed a nationwide lockdown since midnight of 24th March to restrict the spread of the deadly Corona virus disease Covid-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a global pandemic of international concern on 30th Jan 2020. It is found that human-to-human transmission is mainly by close contact with an infected person through coughing, sneezing, respiratory droplets. However, there are cases reported of transmission by viral shedding via faeces [1, 2]. Some of the common symptoms of COVID-19 infection are fever, headache, fatigue, dry cough, respiratory distress, vomiting, diarrhea, etc.\nWater pollution is a major global problem that gives rise to water-borne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, hepatitis, etc., [3, 4]. As per estimates, every year globally, around 1.7 million children below five years of age die, and 38 million Indians suffer from various water-borne diseases. Before the COVID-19 lockdown, major Indian rivers and lakes were heavily polluted due to human activities and getting difficult to be treated [5, 6]. As reported by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of India, 40 million litres of wastewater enter the rivers and other water bodies every day. Only 37% is treated adequately [7]. The rapid urbanization has caused contamination of 70% of freshwater sources in India making them unfit for consumption.\nThe imposition of lockdown to contain the spread of the virus resulted in restrictions on public transportation, commercial and industrial activities that positively impacted the environment and were a blessing in disguise to Mother Nature [8-10]. Improvement in water quality across the river water environment due to reduced economic activities resulted in less pollutants discharged to the rivers [11-13]. Ganga river water quality has shown significant improvement during the COVID-19 lockdown and was found suitable for bathing at most monitoring stations. The enforcement of nationwide lockdown also improved the health of other major Indian rivers.\nIn this paper authors focused to study the effect of COVID19 and its consequences on geographical conditions. It focuses on to study water pollution in the Indian rivers and the characteristics changes. Section 2 discusses the methodology implemented to study characteristic behaviors of water in the rivers. A simple statistical model is presented to measure the parameters. Section 3 deals the results and analysis of the work presented in this paper. Results are presented in graphical and tabular forms, before and after of the COVID period. It shows that during this period natural conditions are much improved. Section 4 presents the conclusion part of the paper."

The biggest and highly contaminated river runs in northern parts if India. On average, the DO concentration increased by 20 to 30%, and BOD decreased by 35 to 40%, based on the studies conducted to monitor the water pollution levels of the sacred river. The quantity of decaying organic matter indicates the BOD level. A lower concentration of BOD and a higher level of DO indicate good water quality. A reduced level of DO in water severely affects aquatic life. The prescribed standard for the survival of aquatic life is BOD less than 3 mg/litre and DO above 5 mg/litre.\nThe measured DO value of river Ganga on 6th March 2020 at Varanasi was 3.8 mg/litre, and on 4th April 2020, 6.8 mg/litre indicating an improvement of 79%. Table 1 shows the data collected by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on 28th March 2020, indicating satisfactory levels of recorded values of DO, BOD & pH at Upstream & Downstream Ganga.\nThe observations of river Ganga in Uttar Pradesh (UP) showed satisfactory results. Totally, 14 locations were monitored. Increasing values of DO and BOD were observed\nin 8 and 4 locations. Decreasing DO, BOD & FCC values were observed in 6, 9 & 10 locations, respectively.

            "text": "In this manuscript, the authors attempted to address the impact of COVID-19 on water pollution in Indian rivers. The critical parameters for assessing the water quality like pH, DO & BOD in some significant Indian rivers during pre-lockdown and lockdown are studied in this work. The pollution levels reduced in the major Indian rivers due to the Covid-19 lockdown, thereby showing a remarkable improvement in water quality due to a complete halt to tourism, pilgrimage,\nand industrial activities. However, domestic sewage contributed to the pollution of the water bodies.\nThe findings suggest that the critical parameters monitored during the lockdown period showed satisfactory levels. These changes may be temporary because, after the lockdown, industrial and human activities will increase, due to which more pollutants will be discharged to the water bodies. Therefore, it is necessary for governments in general/ individuals in particular, to learn from the environmental impact due to lockdown and adopt proper measures to reduce pollution on a long-term basis for the welfare of society."
