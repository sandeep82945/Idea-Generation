Optimization of Co-culture Conditions for Enhanced OCCA Production: Investigate the optimal pH, temperature, and ethanol loading rates for the A. neopropionicum and C. kluyveri co-culture to enhance OCCA production. This could involve systematically varying environmental conditions and substrate concentrations to identify settings that maximize OCCA yields and minimize by-product formation.

Genetic Engineering for Improved Ethanol Tolerance and Productivity: Explore genetic modifications to both A. neopropionicum and C. kluyveri to improve their ethanol tolerance and efficiency in converting ethanol to OCCAs. This could include engineering ethanol transporters, metabolic pathways for ethanol assimilation, and enzymes involved in the chain elongation process to increase the specificity and yield of desired products.

Integration with Syngas Fermentation Processes: Design and evaluate a combined process that integrates syngas fermentation directly with the ethanol-to-OCCA bioconversion process. This could involve developing a tandem bioreactor system where syngas fermentation by acetogens is coupled with the A. neopropionicum and C. kluyveri co-culture for direct conversion of ethanol to OCCAs, aiming to streamline the overall process from syngas to final products.

Exploration of Biomass Retention and In-line Product Extraction Techniques: Investigate the application of biomass retention systems, such as anaerobic filters or membrane bioreactors, and in-line product extraction methods, such as liquid-liquid extraction or adsorption, to enhance the production rates and recoveries of OCCAs. These strategies could help mitigate product inhibition and improve the efficiency of the bioconversion process.

Development of Multi-species Genome-scale Metabolic Models (GEMs): Construct and utilize multi-species GEMs for the A. neopropionicum and C. kluyveri co-culture to predict metabolic interactions, optimize co-culture performance, and identify metabolic bottlenecks or targets for genetic engineering. This computational approach could help in designing strategies for enhancing OCCA production and understanding the complex metabolic dynamics between the co-cultured microorganisms.
