1. **Investigate the effect of different photonic mode densities on the FGR rate constant.** The current study assumes a single photonic mode density, but in reality, there may be a range of different mode densities present in a given system. It would be interesting to explore how the FGR rate constant is affected by the presence of multiple mode densities and how the relative strengths of these mode densities affect the overall rate enhancement.


2. **Extend the theory to include the effects of multiple acceptors.** The current study only considered the case of a single accepter, but in many practical applications, there may be multiple acceptors present. It would be interesting to extend the theory to include the effects of multiple acceptors and to explore how the FGR rate constant is affected by the number and properties of the acceptors.


3. **Investigate the effects of different photonic mode geometries.** The current study assumes a simple two-mode photonic mode, but in reality, there are many different photonic mode geometries that can be used. It would be interesting to explore how the FGR rate constant is affected by the choice of photonic mode and how the different geometries affect the overall rate enhancement.


4. **Explore the use of FGR theory to study other types of chemical processes.** The current study only considered the case of energy transfer, but FGR theory can also be used to study other types of chemical processes, such as charge transfer and electron transfer. It would be interesting to explore how FGR theory can be used to study these other types of processes and to identify the factors that affect the rate enhancement in these cases.


5. **Investigate the experimental feasibility of using FGR to enhance chemical reaction rates.** The current study is a proof-of-concept study that shows that FGR can be used to enhance chemical reaction rates. However, it is not yet clear how feasible it is to use FGR in practice. It would be interesting to conduct experimental studies to explore the feasibility of using FGR to enhance chemical reaction rates and to identify the challenges that need to be Ã¼berwunden.
