    "abstractText": "Distal interphalangeal joint arthrodesis is a frequent surgical operation performed to treat severe arthritis. Nevertheless, the angle selected when fusing the joint is arbitrarily chosen without any quantified data concerning its mechanical effects, thus preventing the optimal choice for the patient. In the current study, we realized an experiment and developed a numerical model to investigate the effect of fusion angle on the biomechanics of adjacent non-operated joints. Six participants performed a pinch grip task while arthrodesis was simulated with a metal splint. Kinematic and force data were recorded during this task and used in a biomechanical model to estimate contact pressures in adjacent joints. The biomechanical model involved combining a multibody system and a finite element method. Results showed that the angle of any distal interphalangeal joint arthrodesis influences index finger kinematics and maximal grip force in several participants. For one participant, in the arthrodesis simulation, we observed an increase of 1.9 MPa in the proximal interphalangeal joint contact pressure. Our results provide quantified information about the biomechanical consequences of this surgical operation and its potential long-term effects.",

The most commonly used implants are K-wires, compression screws, and intramedullary implants like the X-Fuse implant (X-Fuse\u00ae, Stryker, USA). The X-Fuse implant differs from the others by its geometry and mechanical properties which offer good smallbone fusion [2, 10, 27]. In particular, it offers several fusion angle options corresponding to 0, 15, and 25\u00b0 of the DIP joint flexion. Nevertheless, the lack of scientific data prevents any quantified and scientifically validated choice for fusion angles. As a result, the selection is often based on subjective criteria. Zero degrees is commonly chosen for aesthetic reasons [10], whereas 15\u00b0 or 25\u00b0 are recommended for manual workers.\nAt this stage, there is no consensus among biomechanical engineers or clinicians regarding the optimal fusion angle for DIP joint arthrodesis to maximize functional recovery [5, 10, 22]. Most biomechanical studies have focused on proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint arthrodesis [4, 11, 15] with only one study concerning the DIP joint [22]. These authors have shown that a slightly flexed angle, around 20\u00b0, could be more\neffective in improving grip force and manual dexterity than an angle of zero degrees (0\u00b0).\nHowever, such conclusions were made by only using grip force measurements and manual dexterity without considering the internal biomechanics of the corresponding finger. Domalain et al. [11], found that for the PIP joint arthrodesis, the fusion angle can have an influence on the kinematics of other joints. This point is of importance since modifying joint angles may influence the internal mechanics of the osteoarticular system. The effect of arthrodesis on grip force and joint position influences muscle forces, as their production and transmission capacity also depend on joint position, through the force\u2013length relationship and moment arm values [17, 26]. Ultimately, such changes at the muscle level could also influence joint contact pressures [14]. The DIP fusion angle could thus affect the biomechanics of adjacent non-operated joints altering finger kinematics, muscle forces, and joint contact pressures. Higher pressures in those joints could increase cartilage degeneration and lead to the early development of osteoarthritis [6, 13].\nGiven these considerations, it appears crucial to help surgeons in the choice of the DIP fusion angle to study how the index DIP joint arthrodesis (IDIPJA) angle affects the biomechanics of the entire finger. The aim of this study is to investigate the biomechanical consequences of IDIPJA and the associated fusion angle on grip capacities. First, we analyzed the direct impact of the fusion angle on grip force and index finger kinematics. Secondly, we investigated how muscle function was affected by different fusion angles. Finally, the impact at the osteoarticular level was quantified by studying how the DIP fusion angle influences the joint contact pressure in adjacent non-operated joints. To answer this objective, healthy participants performed a pinch grip task, while IDIPJA was simulated with splints. Joint kinematics and grip forces were recorded, and a hybrid biomechanical model of the index was then used to evaluate both muscle forces and joint contact pressures. According to previous literature, we hypothesized that high fusion angles lead to higher grip force, lesser index posture modification, lower muscle forces and lower contact pressure in adjacent joints."

Each participant was free of any upper right extremity disorder and signed an informed consent. This protocol was approved by the AixMarseille University Ethics Committee.\nEach participant was seated in front of a table and performed a pinch grip task. The pinch grip task consisted in grasping a 5.5-cm-long object between the fingertips of the right hand thumb and index (Fig. 1a). Participants were asked to seize and raise the object at a comfortable height and to exert a maximal force on it for 5 s. IDIPJA was simulated by positioning a splint guiding both the dorsal and volar parts of the distal and medial phalanges (Fig. 1b). Three fusion angles were simulated in line with those proposed for X-Fuse implant: 0\u00b0 (A0), 15\u00b0 (A15), and 25\u00b0 (A25). A control condition (C) without splint was also performed, giving a total of four conditions. Two trials were performed for each condition and were separated by a 2 min resting period to prevent fatigue entering into the equation. Grip force and kinematic data were simultaneously recorded and synchronized for each trial. Only the data corresponding to the highest grip force peak trial were used for the analysis."

Linear elastic isotropic material was used for modelling cortical bones (E = 18 GPa, \u03bd = 0.2), cancellous bones (E = 300 MPa, \u03bd = 0.25), tendons (E = 3 GPa, \u03bd = 0.3), and pulleys (E = 1 GPa, \u03bd = 0.3).

[12] on a similar pinch grip task, despite the large variability among the six participants. A greater sample might have led to a reduced inter-variability. Maximal grip force variations according to the four conditions differ considerably between each participant. Two groups were distinguishable with a clear influence of fusion angle for participants P1, P4, and P6 while participants P2, P3, and P5 remained stable. This difference can be explained by the fact that the DIP joint fusion affects patients differently as observed in previous studies [10]. For the three participants showing an influence of fusion angle, maximal grip force was higher for a fusion angle at 0\u00b0 and higher than or equal to the one measured at 25\u00b0 (Fig. 3). This force variation is not in accordance with the study of Melamed et al. which showed that maximal grip force increases with fusion angle [22]. This difference could be due to a difference in the grip task. Melamed et al., 2014 used a smaller pinch width of 3 cm against 5.5 cm in this experiment and studies have shown that this width influences index posture and maximal grip force [12]. This parameter seems to evolve differently by participant and according to the object size.\nConcerning the joint angles, PIP and MCP joint angle levels are consistent with the study of Domalain et al. [12] which used the same object size. Results show important index posture adaptation for only two participants: participant P1 and participant P4 (Fig. 4). Participant P1 mainly modified the MCP joint angle with a more extended posture for the three arthrodesis conditions in comparison to the control condition. Participant P4 mainly modified the PIP joint position, also through more extended postures for the three arthrodesis conditions. This suggests that IDIPJA simulation can lead to adjacent joint posture adaptations, but these adaptations were highly dependent on the participant. It could be assumed that these different types of adaptation were partly due to the anthropometric differences between the participants. The hand length of participant P1 is 20.6 cm against just 17.7 cm for participant P4. They both are the extrema of the averaged population [18]. We can thus suppose that this brings important preferential posture differences in pinch grip tasks according to Ambike et al. [1]."

FDS force ratio turns out zero for the\nparticipants P1 and P5 in arthrodesis conditions. This is probably due to the distal interphalangeal removal from the musculoskeletal model which leads to a higher FDP contribution in the other joints. Consequently, FDP tendon force is enough to equilibrate the index joints, thus reducing the FDS contribution. Results revealed different variations of muscle force ratios during the four conditions depending on the participant. The largest variation in muscle force ratios across all participants and all muscles were observed for the FDS muscle of participant P4 (Fig. 5) with differences between conditions of up to 2.0. These results can be explained by the changes in index joint angles previously discussed, especially by the PIP joint flexion which is less than in the control condition. Given that, the FDS muscle moment arm in the PIP joint increases with PIP joint flexion [3], and the muscle force required to produce the same external moment is reduced. The lower influence of fusion angle on muscle force ratios observed for other participants might be due to the fact that index posture modifications across conditions were also less pronounced (Fig. 4). Our results thus suggest that arthrodesis simulation can lead to a muscle force ratio that is 4.5 times higher than without arthrodesis. Assuming IDIPJA leads to the same effect for patients, these muscle force modifications could have deleterious effects on global hand function. Such muscle force increases could increase the risk of localised fatigue, tendinitis or other muscle and tendon damage ultimately reducing the patients\u2019 functional capacities [25]."

The largest effect of fusion angle on adjacent loading was observed for participant P4, especially for PIP where the difference in joint contact pressure between control condition and a fusion of 0\u00b0 is 1.9 MPa (Fig. 6). This result is not surprising as this participant also showed the largest variations of finger posture and muscle force. It confirms results from previous studies showing an intricate link between abilities (applied force and finger posture), muscle forces, and joint loading [14, 17] and justifying the need for more studies to understand the outcomes of such surgical acts.\nBy combining all these measurements and results, this study showed that arthrodesis simulation can lead to participant specific adaptations of index finger posture, inducing an increase in muscle forces ultimately resulting in higher contact pressure on the joint\u2019s cartilage. Despite the effect of arthrodesis simulation being minimal for most of the participants, a large increase in contact pressure was observed in participant P4. From a clinical perspective, these results\nsuggest that IDIPJA could have an impact on adjacent joint contact pressures. Considering that mechanical loading is one of the most important factors concerning osteoarthritis development [13], more studies are needed to clarify the consequences of IDIPJA on early osteoarthritis onset in the PIP and MCP joints. This aspect is important to take into account for the surgeon considering the importance of PIP and MCP for finger mobility [20].\nOur results indicated that an accurate investigation should be conducted on the patient specificity to clarify the IDIPJA effect on finger biomechanics and help surgeons in their decisions, especially concerning patients\u2019 anthropometry. The consequence on mechanical loading and the pathological risk at adjacent joints could be highly amplified according to each individual. In particular, surgeons should be attentive to patients with hand lengths greater than 90% of the overall population, and patients privileging some pinch grip posture (namely with PIP and MCP extended).\nSome limitations should be considered. First, we focused on IDIPJA simulation and a non-real surgical operation, whereas surgery greatly modifies patients\u2019 situation on other levels than on the anatomical and biomechanical ones [10]. For instance, grip capability could be influenced by a reduced tactile sensibility induced by the operation [24] and thus modify biomechanical consequences on the musculoskeletal system. Another limitation is the task used for this study, which is a pinch grip task with maximal force, which is not representative of everyday activities. It should also be noted that the musculoskeletal multibody rigid and finite element models used in this study are associated with inherent limits, such as the modeling hypothesis and lack of a direct validation method. Nevertheless, these approaches were currently the only means to estimate internal forces and pressures in complex musculoskeletal systems like the hand. In addition, the number of participants was low in this study thus preventing the use of any statistical tests. Finally, it should be mentioned that our study focused solely on the mechanical aspect of osteoarthritis whereas this pathology is multifactorial [21].\nIn spite of these limitations, this study seems to provide some understanding of biomechanical consequences of IDIPJA. Even if results do not enable clarifying the problem of fusion angle choice, the study reveals that this particular surgical operation could have detrimental consequences for patients. Further studies should focus on evaluating patients\u2019 abilities and internal biomechanics pre and post-surgical intervention to clarify the outcomes of IDIPJA and the significance of the fusion angle.\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to thank Mathieu Caumes for his help with the experimental device.\nDeclarations\nConflict of interest The authors declare no competing interests."
