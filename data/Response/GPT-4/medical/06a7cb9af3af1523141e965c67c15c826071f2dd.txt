Epidemiological Study on SEOM Prevalence and Association with Systemic Diseases: Conduct a large-scale epidemiological study to determine the prevalence of SEOMs in the general population and among patients with specific systemic diseases, such as thyroid disorders. This study could explore the correlation between the presence of SEOMs and the development of conditions like hyperthyroidism or thyroid eye disease, aiming to understand if patients with SEOM are at a higher risk of developing certain systemic diseases.

Genetic and Developmental Origins of SEOM: Investigate the genetic and developmental mechanisms leading to the formation of SEOMs. This research could focus on identifying specific genetic mutations or developmental disruptions that result in the anomalous formation of extraocular muscles. Studies might involve animal models to trace the developmental pathway of SEOMs, shedding light on the evolutionary aspects and atavistic features suggested by Whitnall and others.

Functional and Structural Impact of SEOM on Ocular Health: Examine the functional and structural impacts of SEOMs on the eye, including their effects on ocular motility, eyelid function, and visual acuity. This could involve detailed clinical examinations, imaging studies, and possibly surgical observations to understand how SEOMs affect the mechanics of eye movement and contribute to conditions like strabismus or eyelid retraction.

Management and Treatment Strategies for SEOM-Related Conditions: Develop and evaluate management strategies and treatment protocols for patients with SEOM, particularly those presenting with restrictive strabismus or other functional impairments. This could include surgical interventions, physiotherapy, and novel therapeutic approaches to address the unique challenges posed by SEOMs. Clinical trials comparing different management strategies could provide insights into optimizing patient outcomes.

Longitudinal Studies on SEOM Progression and Interaction with Thyroid Eye Disease: Initiate longitudinal studies to monitor the progression of SEOM in patients over time, especially in those with concurrent thyroid disorders. This research could explore how SEOMs interact with the development and progression of thyroid eye disease, including potential exacerbation of symptoms or impacts on treatment efficacy. Understanding the dynamics between SEOMs and thyroid eye disease could offer critical insights into both conditions and inform more tailored and effective patient care.
