Box 513, 5600 MB Eindhoven, The Netherlands (Dated: September 8, 2022)\nThere has been a recent upsurge of interest in the quantum properties of magnons for quantum information processing. An important issue is to examine the stability of quantum states of magnons against various relaxation and dephasing channels. Since the interaction of magnons in magnetic systems may fall in the ultra-strong and even deep-strong coupling regimes, the relaxation process of magnon states is quite different from the more common quantum optical systems. Here we study the relaxation and dephasing of magnons based on the Lindblad formalism and derive a generalized master equation that describes the quantum dynamics of magnons. Employing this master equation, we identify two distinct dissipation channels for squeezed magnons, i.e., the local dissipation and collective dissipation, which play a role for both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. The local dissipation is caused by the independent exchange of angular momentum between the magnonic system and the environment, while the collective dissipation is dressed by the parametric interactions of magnons and it enhances the quantumness and thermal stability of squeezed magnons. Further, we show how this formalism can be applied to study the pure dephasing of magnons caused by four-magnon scattering and magnon-phonon interactions. Our results provide the theoretical tools to study the decoherence of magnons within a full quantum-mechanical framework and further benefit the use of quantum states of magnons for information processing.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nMagnons are the collective excitation of ordered magnets and they can carry information for data storage and processing. Because of the low dissipation rate and long spin diffusion length of magnons in magnetic insulators, the information coded in magnons can, in principle, weaken Joule heating problems and thus it is a desirable candidate for durable information processing1. As bosonic particles, magnons share considerable similarities with photons and the quantum states of magnons such as single-magnon state2,3, squeezed states4\u20138, Schro\u0308dinger cat states9,10 and quantum many-body states11 have already been proposed in magnonic systems for information processing. The emerging field, dubbed \u201cquantum magnonics\u201d11, has started to attract significant interest due to its potential to push the traditional studies of magnonics to the quantum limit, and for its convenient docking with mature solid-state quantum platforms, such as cavity photons, mechanical oscillators, superconducting qubits and single-spin qubits.\nTo achieve desirable information processing using hybrid magnonic systems, a crucial objective is to maintain the coherence of magnons for a longer time. The decoherence in a magnetic system may come from the coupling of magnons with conduction electrons, lattice vibrations or phonons, impurities and magnon-magnon scattering process. The standard approach to characterize the dissipation of magnons in the past century is to introduce a phenomenological parameter called the Gilbert damping in the classical magnetization dynamics12,13. The linewidth of the magnetic resonance under external mi-\ncrowave driving is proportional to the Gilbert damping. By analyzing the frequency and temperature dependence of the linewidth, one may extract the various contributions to the damping14\u201317. In the framework of quantum optics, one usually introduces a decay rate of the photon mode, together with a stochastic field acting on the photon in the Heisenberg-Langevin equation, according to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem18. However, different from photons, magnons in the magnets are naturally coupled with each other through either anisotropy or exchange interactions19. The coupling strength can easily reach ultra-strong and even deep-strong coupling regimes11. For example, in a two-sublattice antiferromagnet (AFM), the coupling of sublattice magnons is on the order of exchange interaction, which is as strong as the on-site frequency of the magnons. One has to consistently include the interactions among magnons to get a reasonable prediction of both the dynamic and equilibrium properties of the magnonic systems, especially the decoherence time of magnons. It has been known that the strong interactions inside a hybrid quantum optical system can cause additional dissipation channels and modify the dynamic equations20\u201323. For magnonic systems, how the strong interaction among magnons influences the relaxation processes channels, especially its influence on the robustness of the quantum properties of magnons, has not been examined so far.\nOn the other hand, up till now, most of the studies on the magnon decoherence only account for relaxation process, while how pure dephasing without relaxation process almost gains no attention. If one intends to use quantum states of magnons for quantum information process-\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n02 96\n1v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\nes -h\nal l]\n7 S\nep 2\n02 2\n2 ing, the pure dephasing channel should be treated equal footing as the relaxation channel and be addressed properly, resembling the situation in more conventional qubit systems24\u201327.\nIn this article, we study the relaxation and dephasing of magnons in both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets based on the Lindblad formalism. We derive a generalized master equation for the dynamics of magnons under the Born-Markov approximation. In particular, we identify the interaction induced collective relaxation channels of magnons. This channel could not only enhance the entanglement of magnons, but also makes the quantum correlations of magnons more stable against thermal fluctuations, which is very different from the local dissipation that will destroy the quantumness of the systems. Second, we show that the antiferromagnetic magnons are subject to a decoherence-free evolution in ideal conditions when they are subject to a common bath. The comparison with the relaxation process within classical equation of motion is discussed in detail. Further, we show how our theoretical formalism can recover the dephaisng channels of magnons through four-magnon interaction and magnon-phonon coupling.\nOur work is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we present the generalized formalism to consider the magnon relaxation caused by their interaction with the environment. In Sec. III, we apply the general formalism to study the stability of the single-mode squeezed state in an anisotropic ferromagnet. Then we introduce the twomode squeezed magnons28,29 in a two-sublattice AFM and their relaxation channel subject to both two separate and one common bath and show how decoherencefree evolution of magnons can be realized in Sec. IV. The classical-quantum analogue of the dissipation channels is also discussed in detail. In Sec. V, we apply the generalized master equation to address the dephasing of magnons caused by magnon-magnon interaction and magnon-phonon scattering. In Sec. VI, we come to the discussions and conclusions. Unless stated otherwise, the reduced Planck constant ~ is set to one."

            "text": "Let us consider a magnonic system described by the Hamiltonian H\u0302FM, which is expressed in terms of the magnon creation (a\u0302\u2020) and annihilation (a\u0302) operators in general. To study the decoherence of the magnon state against thermal fluctuation, we model the environment as\na collection of harmonic oscillators, i.e., H\u0302R = \u2211 i \u03c9ic\u0302 \u2020 i c\u0302i, with commutation relations [c\u0302i, c\u0302 \u2020 j ] = \u03b4ij . The interaction of magnons with the bath is through the coherent trans-\nfer between magnons and bath, H\u0302int = \u2211 i gi(a\u0302c\u0302 \u2020 i + a\u0302\n\u2020c\u0302i). Note that the bath modes in the environment may include phonons, electron-hole pairs, or impurities. Here we do not specify them and only assume a phenomenological coupling coefficient gi for simplicity. A more detailed consideration of the various baths will not influence\nthe essential physics presented below. It will, however, determine the temperature and frequency dependence of the coupling coefficients30\u201332. With these assumptions, the total Hamiltonian of the system reads\nH\u0302T = H\u0302FM + H\u0302R + H\u0302int. (1)\nSince the total system is Hermitian, its dynamic evolution should follow the master equation \u2202\u03c1\u0302T (t)/\u2202t = i[\u03c1\u0302T (t), H\u0302T], where \u03c1\u0302T is the density matrix of the total system. To eliminate the non-interacting terms in the total Hamiltonian H\u0302T, we transfer to the interaction picture and trace out the degree of freedoms for the bath to derive the evolution of the ferromagnetic magnons as\nd\u03c1\u0303(t)\ndt = \u2212 \u222b t 0 dt\u2032trR [ H\u0303int(t), [H\u0303int(t\u2032), \u03c1\u0303T (t\u2032)] ] , (2)\nwhere \u03c1\u0303(t) \u2261 trR\u03c1\u0303T(t). Here all the operators in the interaction picture are labeled with an overhead tilde. Under the Born-Markov approximation, the master equation (2) can be reduced to33\u201336\nd\u03c1\u0303(t)\ndt = \u2212 \u222b t 0 dt\u2032trR [ H\u0303int(t), [H\u0303int(t\u2032), \u03c1\u0303(t)\u2297 \u03c1\u0303R(0)] ] ,\n(3) where \u03c1\u0303R(0) is the initial density matrix of the bath and is assumed to be independent of time due to its large degrees of freedoms. Now the state of magnons \u03c1\u0303(t) does not explicitly depend on its history \u03c1\u0303(t\u2032) (t\u2032 < t). Following the standard notations to rewrite the interaction in the form H\u0302int = \u2211 i s\u0302i \u2297 \u0393\u0302i36, where s\u0302i and \u0393\u0302i are respectively the operators acting in the spaces of magnonic system and bath, the master equation (3) can be finally written as\nd\u03c1\u0303(t)\ndt = \u2212 \u2211 i,j [s\u0303i(t)s\u0303j(t \u2032)\u03c1\u0303(t)\u2212 s\u0303j(t\u2032)\u03c1\u0303(t)s\u0303i(t)]\u3008\u0393\u0303i(t)\u0393\u0303j(t\u2032)\u3009\n\u2212 \u2211 i,j [\u03c1\u0303(t)s\u0303j(t \u2032)s\u0303i(t)\u2212 s\u0303i(t)\u03c1\u0303(t)s\u0303j(t\u2032)]\u3008\u0393\u0303j(t\u2032)\u0393\u0303i(t)\u3009.\n(4) This equation is very general and has been widely used to study the dynamic behavior of open quantum system in quantum optics33\u201336. Below we shall study the relaxation of both the single-mode and two-mode squeezed magnons and pure dephasing of magnons based on this master equation37."

The classical ground state of the system is \u3008Si\u3009 = Sez. To consider the magnon excitation above this ground state, we perform Holstein-Primakoff (HP) transformation of the spin operators38, i.e., S\u0302iz = S \u2212 a\u0302\u2020a\u0302, S\u0302+i = \u221a\n2S \u2212 a\u0302\u2020a\u0302a\u0302, S\u0302\u2212i = a\u0302 \u2020 \u221a\n2S \u2212 a\u0302\u2020a\u0302, and substitute them into (5) to derive the effective Hamiltonian of magnon excitations up to the quadratic order as\nH\u0302FM = \u03c9aa\u0302\u2020a\u0302+ gaa(a\u0302\u2020a\u0302\u2020 + a\u0302a\u0302), (6)\nwhere \u03c9a = 2KzS + KxS + H, gaa = KxS/2. Here we considered uniform precession mode of spins such that magnon operator a\u0302 is spatial independent and the exchange coefficient J does not appear in the Hamiltonian.\nNevertheless, the formalism presented below is straightforward to be generalized to study the evolution of the magnon modes with non-zero wavevectors.\nThe ground state of the magnonic system described by Hamiltonian (6) is a single-mode squeezed state |GS\u3009 = exp(r/2(a\u0302a\u0302 \u2212 a\u0302\u2020a\u0302\u2020))|0\u3009 with squeezing parameter r = arctanh(2gaa/\u03c9a)/2 > 0 and magnon occupation \u3008a\u0302\u2020a\u0302\u3009 = sinh2 r. The uncertainties of the total spin components S\u0302x = \u2211 i S\u0302 x i and S\u0302y = \u2211 i S\u0302 y i in this ground state\nare respectively, \u2206Sx \u2261 \u221a \u3008S\u03022x\u3009 \u2212 \u3008S\u0302x\u30092 = e\u2212r \u221a NS/2\nand \u2206Sy \u2261 \u221a \u3008S\u03022y\u3009 \u2212 \u3008S\u0302y\u30092 = er \u221a NS/2. It is clear that\nthe noise of S\u0302x is squeezed below the symmetric limit at the sacrifice of uncertainty increase in the S\u0302y component. The Heisenberg uncertainty relation is still maintained.\nNow we are ready to apply the general formalism to study the quantum decoherence of squeezed magnons.

By substituting all these variables into the master equation (4), simplifying the integrals using\nbath correlations at equilibrium conditions, and finally transferring it back to the original Schro\u0308dinger picture, we have\nd\u03c1\u0302 dt = i[\u03c1\u0302, H\u0302FM] + \u03ba(nth + 1) [\u03b7\u03c9\u03c9Laa + \u03b7\u03c9g(Laa\u2020 + La\u2020a) + \u03b7ggLa\u2020a\u2020 ] [\u03c1\u0302]\n+\u03banth [\u03b7\u03c9\u03c9La\u2020a\u2020 + \u03b7\u03c9g(Laa\u2020 + La\u2020a) + \u03b7ggLaa] [\u03c1\u0302], (8)\nwhere LAB [\u03c1\u0302] = 2A\u0302\u03c1\u0302B\u0302\u2020 \u2212 \u03c1\u0302A\u0302\u2020B\u0302 \u2212 A\u0302\u2020B\u0302\u03c1\u0302 is the generalized Lindblad operator, and nth = (e\n\u03c9r/kBT \u2212 1)\u22121 is the Bose-Einstein distribution function with T being the bath temperature, \u03ba is the effective relaxation rate defined as \u03ba \u2261 g(\u03c9r)D(\u03c9r), where D(\u03c9r) is the total density states of bath modes at the resonance frequency \u03c9r.\nThe three distinguishable relaxation coefficients \u03b7\u03c9\u03c9, \u03b7\u03c9g, \u03b7gg are respectively defined as\n\u03b7\u03c9\u03c9 = (\u03c9r + \u03c9a)\n2\n4\u03c92r , \u03b7\u03c9g =\ngaa(\u03c9r + \u03c9a)\n2\u03c92r , \u03b7gg = g2aa \u03c92r . (9)\nHere \u03b7\u03c9\u03c9 is the leading-order relaxation rate, and \u03b7\u03c9g and \u03b7gg can respectively be viewed as the first and second order corrections of the dissipation channels caused by the squeezing interactions. Their dependencies on the\nhard-axis anisotropy of the system gaa (or equivalently Kx) are shown in Fig. 1(a). As the anisotropy parameter gaa increases, both \u03b7\u03c9g and \u03b7gg becomes comparable with the leading-order terms \u03b7\u03c9\u03c9 and thus they can not be neglected any longer. Note that we can derive the dynamic equation (8) alternatively, by first transferring to the diagonal basis of Hamiltonian (6) through a Bogliubov transformation, deriving the master equation in this basis and then transfer back to the original basis. Equation (8) is a powerful result that allows us to study the quantum dynamics of squeezed magnons starting from any initial state, as well as the equilibrium properties of the squeezed magnons.\nAn intuitive picture to understand these corrections of dissipation channels is illustrated in Fig. 1(b). Without\n4 (a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nsymmetric limit\n\u03b7\n\u03b7 \u03b7\u03c9\u03c9 gg\n\u03c9g\nFIG. 1.

The expected value of the uncertainty in the ground state is plotted as black dashed lines. (d) Uncertainty of S\u0302x as a function of thermal occupation nth. gaa/H = 1.0. The horizontal dashed line represents the symmetric limit. Above the horizontal line, both the uncertainties of S\u0302x and S\u0302y are larger than the symmetric limit, even though the uncertainty of S\u0302x is still smaller than S\u0302y.\nsqueezing (gaa = 0, \u03b7\u03c9\u03c9 = 1, \u03b7\u03c9g = \u03b7gg = 0), magnons can only directly relax to the ground state at zero temperature. The resulting master equation is reduced to the form\nd\u03c1\u0302 dt = i[\u03c1\u0302, H\u0302FM] + \u03ba(nth + 1)Laa[\u03c1\u0302] + \u03banthLa\u2020a\u2020 [\u03c1\u0302]. (10)\nWith squeezing, the magnons may first be excited to higher energy levels (gaaa\u0302\n\u2020a\u0302\u2020) and then relax, which gives the first-order correction (\u03b7\u03c9g). Further, the magnons on energy level |n\u3009 may be excited to |n+2\u3009 and fall back to |n\u3009 and then relax, this correspond to the second-order correction (\u03b7gg). These higher-order processes involve the simultaneous excitation/annihilation of two or more magnons, hence we refer to them as collective relaxation channels.\nTo study how the collective relaxation channel influences the quantumness of the system, we simulate the quantum master equation (8) and show the uncertainty of the Sx component as a function of anisotropy in Fig. 1(c).\nHere the uncertainty is defined as \u2206x = \u221a\n2/NS\u2206Sx. As the anisotropy parameter gaa increases, the generalized master equation recovers a steady state with much stronger squeezing (\u2206x,G, red solid line) than the result by only including the local dissipations (\u2206x,L, red dashed lines). By zooming in the steady state, we found it is ex-\nactly the ground state of the system |GS\u3009, and thus they share the same magnon occupation and squeezing of S\u0302x (\u2206x,th, black dashed lines). As a comparison, the system cannot relax to ground state if only the local dissipation is considered (\u2206x,L, red dashed lines). Therefore, strictly speaking, the generalized master equation is essential to recover the correct equilibrium properties of the interacting magnon system.\nFigure 1(d) shows the influence of temperature on the magnon squeezing. Firstly, as the temperature increases, the uncertainty \u2206x,G gradually increases above the symmetric limit. The critical value of the temperature is around 2 K for nth = 0.46 and \u03c9r/2\u03c0 = 48.5 GHz. This behavior clearly shows that magnon squeezing is a low temperature quantum phenomenon. It is different from the elliptical trajectory of spin precession under the influence of anisotropy, which always exists in anisotropic systems regardless of temperature39. Secondly, when only the local dissipation channel is taken into account, the squeezing will die at nth = 0.27 smaller than the value of 0.46 when both local and collective dissipation channels are taken into account. This comparison suggests that the collective relaxation channel can increase the thermal stability of the quantumness of magnons."

Then we can follow the standard HP transformation to quantize the magnon excitation above this ground state as\nH\u0302AFM = \u03c9aa\u0302\u2020a\u0302+ \u03c9bb\u0302\u2020b\u0302+ gab(a\u0302\u2020b\u0302\u2020 + a\u0302b\u0302), (12)\n5 where \u03c9a,b = Hex +Han\u00b1H, Hex = 2ZJS2, Han = 2KzS with Z being the coordination number, gab = Hex is the coupling of magnon modes excited on the two sublattices. Again, we focus on the uniform precession mode. The ground-state entanglement of magnons taking the contribution of finite wavevectors into account can be found in Refs.40\u201342\nTo describe the interaction of magnons with the environment, we have to clarify whether the two types of magnons are subject to two separate bath or one common bath. Both cases contain local and collective dissipation channels, but they will result in very different relaxation process as we shall discuss below."

Then the collective relaxation channels \u03b7\u03c9g and \u03b7gg may not play a significant role in the regime Hex Han (gab/\u03c9a \u223c 0). The intuitive picture to understand the local and collective dissipation channels is plotted in Fig. 2(b). Instead of single-mode squeezing as shown in Fig. 1(b), now the two-mode squeezing will launch the collective dissipation channels after simultaneously exciting two magnons.\nEquipped with the generalized master equation (16), we study the collective dissipation channel\u2019s influence on the steady state of the system. We first simulate the steady magnon occupation and entanglement of sublattice magnons as a function of the magnon-magnon cou-\npling and show the results in Fig. 2(c). Here the entanglement of sublattice magnons En is quantified as the logarithmic negativity of the joint density matrix11. In the ground state, EN = r (black dashed line in Fig. 2(c)), where r is nothing but the squeezing parameter of the two-mode squeezed state. At zero temperature, the system will gradually evolve toward this ground state, when all the dissipation channels are included (red solid line). This is physically expected. If only the local relaxation channels are considered, however, the system will end up in a different steady states with lower entanglement (red dashed lines), similar to the relaxation of single-mode squeezed state as discussed in Sec. III. The collective dissipation channel becomes more pronounced for stronger exchange coupling, which is typically valid for a crystalline antiferromagnet. Through this comparison, it is clear that the inclusion of the collective dissipation channel is indispensable to recover the physical steady state of the system.\nWhen thermal fluctuations are taken into account, the entanglement of sublattice magnons decreases and is subject to a sudden death at a critical temperature (around 8 K for \u03c9r = 1 THz), as shown in Fig. 2(d). Here, the collective dissipation channel makes the magnon-magnon entanglement survive at a even higher temperature (red solid line) and thus increases the thermal stability of the entanglement. This also resembles the behavior of singlemode squeezed state."

(21)\nThis master equation describes the evolution of any noninteracting boson system, and is not limited to magnonic system. It is also straightforward to extend it to the multi-mode case, by noticing the symmetry of boson modes distribution in the Liouville operator. As a comparison, the evolution of two qubits coupled to a common bath has been more widely discussed, because it supports decoherence free evolution45\u201348 and is useful for quantum computing without error correction. We will show that this is also true for both non-interacting and interacting\nmagnons.\nLet us first analyze how a physical observable evolves under the master equation (19). Note that the master equation (19) is linear in the density matrix and it can be formally written as, d\u03c1\u0302/dt = L\u03c1\u0302, which has a formal solution \u03c1\u0302(t) = eLt\u03c1\u0302(0).

In the limit with gab = Hex Han, we obtain \u03c9r gab, |\u3008a(t)\u3009| = \u03b2| cos(\u03c9rt)|, implying that the coherence will keep oscillating with the period of 2\u03c0/\u03c9r. In the intermediate regime, we have\n|\u3008a\u0302(t)\u3009| = \u03b2/ \u221a 2 \u221a (1 + \u03b62) + (1\u2212 \u03b62) cos 2\u03c9rt, (26)\nwhere \u03b6 = \u221a\n1 + (gab/\u03c9r)2 \u2212 gab/\u03c9r.

Here we numerically evaluate both the magnon occupation \u3008a\u0302\u2020a\u0302\u3009 and first-order coherence function of magnons as, g (1) a = |a\u0302\u2020(t)a\u0302(0)|. Clearly, in the absence of magnon coupling (gab = 0), there is a decoherence free evolution, while the decoherence oscillates in time when the coupling of two magnon modes is included (gab 6= 0)."

This formalism allows us to study the quantum properties of magnons, for exmaple, magnon squeezing and entanglement. In modern spintronics, a widely used approach is to study the magnon excitation and propagation based on the classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation12,13. In this classical formalism, the relaxation of magnons is modelled by a phenomenological parameter called Gilbert damping. In this section, we compare the relaxation rate in the quantum equation of motion with that in the classical equation of motion, and show that the models of two separate baths and one common bath each capture part of the relaxation process, while a hybrid bath model seems more proper to fully describe the magnon relaxation. Even with this correspondence, we emphasize that the quantum formalism is essential to study the quantum properties, such as entanglement, of magnons. These cannot be addressed using the classical formalism. Classical equation of motion.\u2014 The dissipation channel via one common bath enhances the magnon lifetime. This is consistent with the classical relaxation of spins, by introducing the intersublattice damping. To make this point clear, let us recall the LLG equations of a twosublattice AFM50\n\u2202Sj \u2202t = \u2212Sj\u00d7Hj+Sj\u00d7 [ \u03b1 \u2202Sj \u2202t + \u03b1c 2 ( \u2202Sj\u22121 \u2202t + \u2202Sj+1 \u2202t )] , (27) where Hj = \u2212\u03b4HAFM/\u03b4Sj is the effective field acting on the spin of j\u2212th site. Here Sj is a classical vector with magnitude S, instead of the quantum operator in the quantum model. The first and second terms on the right-hand-side of Eq. (27) describe the spin precessing and relaxation toward the equilibrium axis, respectively. The coefficients \u03b1 and \u03b1c are two phenomenological parameters that characterize the strength of dissipation, and they are usually termed as Gilbert damping and intersublattice damping50,51. Recently, Equation (27) was reproduced using a Caldeira-Leggett approach when the two subsystems have both shared and separate baths52.\nIn the classical picture, the lowest-energy magnon excitation can be viewed as the uniform precession of spins around the Ne\u0301el-type ground state, i.e., S2j = Sez + \u03b4Sa(t), S2j+1 = \u2212Sez +\u03b4Sb(t). By substituting the trial solutions into Eq. (27) and keeping only the linear terms in the small perturbations \u03b4Sa,b, we obtain\ni \u2202\n\u2202t ( \u03b4S+a \u03b4S+b ) = Heff ( \u03b4S+a \u03b4S+b ) , (28)\nwhere \u03b4S+a,b = \u03b4S x a,b + i\u03b4S y a,b are classical fields, corresponding to the spin rising operators in the quantum framework, and Heff is the effective Hamiltonian of magnon excitation that takes the form\n9 Heff = ( \u2212\u03c9a + i(\u03b1cgab \u2212 \u03b1\u03c9a) \u2212gab + i(\u03b1c\u03c9a \u2212 \u03b1gab) gab + i(\u03b1c\u03c9a \u2212 \u03b1gab) \u03c9a + i(\u03b1cgab \u2212 \u03b1\u03c9a) ) . (29)\nHere we have assumed \u03b1, \u03b1c 1 to safely neglect the higher-order terms of damping. The Hamiltonian (29) is non-Hermitian for the existence of damping in the dynamic equations, but PT antisymmetric (APT ). To prove this statement, we introduce the parity and time reversal operators as follows\nP\u0302 = \u03c3\u0302x, T\u0302 = I\u0302K\u0302, (30)\nwhere \u03c3\u0302x is Pauli matrix which exchanges the position of two types of magnons (a \u2194 b), I\u0302 is identify operator and K\u0302 is complex conjugate. One can readily prove {P\u0302T\u0302 ,Heff} = 0 such that the system is PT antisymmetric. Now two phases can be classified according to the eigenvalues (\u03c9\u00b1) of Heff . If both eigenvalues are purely imaginary, the APT symmetry is unbroken, which is denoted as APT exact phase. Otherwise, the APT symmetry is broken.\nSpecifically, the eigenvalues of the system can be obtained by solving the secular equation det(\u03c9I\u2212Heff) = 0 as\n\u03c9\u00b1 = \u2212i(\u03b1\u03c9a \u2212 \u03b1cgab)\u00b1 \u03c9r. (31)\nNow the phase boundary separating the APT exact and and APT broken phase is \u03b1c = \u03b1\u03c9a/gab. In the APT exact phase, Im(\u03c9\u00b1) > 0, then the linearized fluctuations will grow exponentially and diverge, which indicates that the Ne\u0301el-type ground state is not stable any longer. Here we will always focus our discussions on the APT broken phase. In this regime, the magnon lifetime is \u03c4cl = 1/(\u03b1\u03c9a \u2212 \u03b1cgab), corresponding to the magnon relaxation time \u03c4qm = 1/[(\u03b7\u03c9\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b7gg)\u03b3] in the quantum formalism.\nClassical vs quantum.\u2014 Now let us go a step further to connect the classical and quantum relaxation process. By comparing the classical equation of motion (28) with the quantum equation (23) obtained from the one bath model, we find the correspondence\n\u03b1\u03c9a \u2194 \u03b7\u03c9\u03c9\u03ba, \u03b1cgab \u2194 \u03b7gg\u03ba. (32)\nNote that \u03b7\u03c9\u03c9 > \u03b7gg as shown in Fig. 2(a), implying \u03b1\u03c9a > \u03b1cgab, hence the stability of the Ne\u0301el-type ground state is always guaranteed. On the other hand, if we compare the classical equation of motion (28) with the quantum equation obtained from the two-bath model, we find the correspondence\n\u03b1\u03c9a \u2194 \u03b7\u03c9\u03c9\u03ba, \u03b1cgab \u2194 0. (33)\nNow we are in a position to discuss which quantum model is more proper to describe the magnon relaxation in an AFM. If the intersublattice damping of a material is zero, within the master equation approach, it seems\nthat we can readily choose the two bath model, which means that the sublattice magnons respectively dissipate angular momentum into their own bath and the spin information emitted by one sublattice magnon will quickly lose in the bath and cannot influence the precession of the other magnon. This may be true for the recent 2D bilayered van der Waals magnets, where the observed magnon linewidth does not support the prediction of intersublattice damping44, and synthetic AFMs. On the other hand, if the intersublattice damping of a material is not zero, for example in the metallic AFMs, XMn (X = Pt,Pd, Ir,Fe) as confirmed by first-principles calculations53,54, the one bath model must be taken into account. One immediate question is whether the one bath model is sufficient to describe such an AFM.\nThe answer is no, which can be justified by reductio ad absurdum. If the two sublattice magnons perfectly share one bath, then the coherent precession of spins will persist forever as discussed in the last section. This may be the case if one can artificially engineer the bath perfectly, but is apparently not true in a natural AFM according to the second law of thermodynamics. Combing all these discussions, it seems more reasonable to use a hybrid bath model to completely describe the magnon dissipation. Here the spins on the two sublattices each have an independent channel to relax, for example, by coupling to the phonons and impurities, while they also share a common bath, for example, the conduction electrons could bridge the dissipation of the two sublattices, as justified by the first-principle calculations53 and analytical treatment of magnon-electron scattering55. Taking all these into account, the master equation reads\nd\u03c1\u0302 dt = i[\u03c1\u0302, H\u0302AFM] +\n[ L(0,2B) + L(0,1B) + L(1,1B) ] [\u03c1\u0302],\n(34) where L(0,2B) and L(0,1B) have identical form as Eq. (17), while L(1,1B) has the form Eq. (20).\nFollowing the same procedures to derive Eq. (23), we find the correspondence principle,\n\u03b1\u03c9a \u2194 \u03b7\u03c9\u03c9(\u03ba2 + \u03ba1), \u03b1cgab \u2194 \u03b7gg\u03ba1, (35)\nwhere \u03ba2 and \u03ba1 are respectively the coupling strength of the spins to the two-separate bath and one common bath. Now the perfect decoherence-free evolution predicted in the model of one common bath vanishes52 and |\u3008a(t)\u3009| will decay to zero with a time scale of \u03c4\u22121 = (\u03b7\u03c9\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b7gg)\u03ba2. The strength of \u03ba2 directly determines the decoherence time of the system, which corresponds to the intrinsic damping stated in Ref.50.\nTypical evolutions of particle number and coherence of the hybrid model are shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d). Now the coherence of an initial product state gradually decreases to zero, regardless of the strength of coupling\n10\nbetween sublattice magnons (gab). The particle number evolves to zero (a finite value) without (with) the sublattice coupling. The finite sublattice coupling also generates a steady entanglement between the magnons, as expected. This is different from the oscillating behavior of entanglement shown in Fig. 3(b)."

III and IV, pure dephasing of magnons without energy relaxation is another important channel that can cause decoherence of the magnons. In our recent work37, we have explicitly demonstrated that both four-magnon scattering and magnon-phonon scattering contribute to the pure dephasing of magnons, and the dephasing rate depends on the exchange coefficient, magnetoelastic coupling strength, external field and temperature. In this section, we provide a detailed derivation of the master equation accounting for pure dephasing, following a methodology similar to our considerations above."

Employing the HP transformation of the spin operators and retaining up to the fourth-order terms of magnon-magnon interaction, we derive the effective Hamiltonian of magnon excitations as37,\nH\u0302FM = \u2211 k \u03c9ka\u0302 \u2020 ka\u0302k + \u2211 k,k\u2032,q C(k,k\u2032,q)a\u0302\u2020k+qa\u0302 \u2020 k\u2032\u2212qa\u0302k\u2032 a\u0302k,\n(36) where \u03c9k = ZJSd\n2k2 +H is the magnon dispersion relation with d the lattice constant, C(k,k\u2032,q) is the interaction strength of magnons that depends on the exchange coefficients and structure factor of the system. Different from the consideration in Sec. III and IV, now both uniform (k = 0) and nonuniform (k 6= 0) precession modes as well as their interaction are taken into account. This is essential to discuss the dephasing of magnons caused by exchange interaction. As we go further, we simplify the triple sum on the right-hand-side of Eq. (36) by focusing on the dynamics of a particular magnon mode with wavevector k0 (for example, the ferromagnetic resonance mode). Then we reduce the four-magnon interaction in (36) and rewrite the Hamiltonian as\nH\u0302FM = \u03c9ra\u0302\u2020a\u0302+ \u2211 k6=k0 \u03c9ka\u0302 \u2020 ka\u0302k + a\u0302 \u2020a\u0302 \u2211 k6=k0 g(k)a\u0302\u2020ka\u0302k, (37)\nwhere we have defined a\u0302 \u2261 a\u0302k0 , \u03c9r = \u03c9k0 , g(k) = C(k0,k,q = 0) to make the notation simple and consistent with our notations in discussing magnon relaxation.\nFollowing the discussion in Ref.37, we shall treat all the magnon modes (k 6= k0) as bath degrees of freedom and trace them out to derive the dynamics of the magnon mode k0. This treatment readily allows us to apply our generalized master equation approach presented in Sec. II to study this problem. Recalling the generalized master equation (4), we immediately have the corre-\nspondence s\u0303 = a\u0302\u2020a\u0302 and \u0393\u0303 = \u2211\nk g(k)a\u0302 \u2020 ka\u0302k. However, we\ncannot apply this correspondence directly, because the derivation of Eq. (4) requires the mean average of the bath operator being equal to zero, i.e., \u3008\u0393\u0303\u3009 = 0, which is not true here. To fulfill this requirement, we reformulate the Hamiltonian (37) as\nH\u0302FM = \u03c9 \u2032 ra\u0302 \u2020a\u0302+ \u2211 k6=k0 \u03c9ka\u0302 \u2020 ka\u0302k+a\u0302 \u2020a\u0302 \u2211 k6=k0 g(k)(a\u0302\u2020ka\u0302k\u2212\u3008a\u0302 \u2020 ka\u0302k\u3009),\n(38)\nwhere \u03c9 \u2032 r = \u03c9r + \u2211 k g(k)\u3008a\u0302 \u2020 ka\u0302k\u3009 is the modified eigenfrequency of the system. Now the new bath operator\n\u0393\u0303 = \u2211\nk6=k0 g(k)(a\u0302 \u2020 ka\u0302k \u2212 \u3008a\u0302 \u2020 ka\u0302k\u3009) has zero mean and we\ncan substitute it back into Eq. (4) and derive the master equation describing the evolution of mode k0 as\nd\u03c1\u0302 dt = i[\u03c1\u0302, H\u0302s] + \u03badpLn\u0302n\u0302(\u03c1\u0302), (39)\nwhere \u03c1\u0302 is the density matrix describing the mode k0, H\u0302s = \u03c9 \u2032 ra\u0302 \u2020a\u0302, Ln\u0302n\u0302(\u03c1) \u2261 2n\u0302\u03c1\u0302n\u0302\u2020\u2212n\u0302\u2020n\u0302\u03c1\u2212\u03c1\u0302n\u0302\u2020n\u0302 with n\u0302 = a\u0302\u2020a\u0302. The parameter \u03badp is a coefficient that characterizes the strength of dephasing\n\u03badp = \u222b \u221e 0 |D(\u03c9)g(\u03c9)|2nth[nth + 1]d\u03c9. (40)\nNote that the modified frequency in the continuum limit reads\n\u03c9 \u2032\nr = \u03c9r + \u222b \u221e 0 g(\u03c9)D(\u03c9)nthd\u03c9. (41)\nAt low temperature, this only gives a small correction to the eigenfrequency, hence it can be safely disregarded, i.e., \u03c9 \u2032\nr \u2248 \u03c9r. Here the strength of the dephasing rate \u03badp can be comparable to relaxatoin rate of magnons in magnetic insulators and thus has to be considered when manipulating the quantum states of magnons in magnetic insulators at low temperature. An extensive discussion of the dephasing rate \u03badp can be found in Ref. 37."

Here we consider a one dimensional spin chain along the z\u2212axis as an example. The effective Hamiltonian describing the interaction of magnons and phonons32 is H\u0302int = \u2211 j bzz(S\u0302 z j ) 2\u0302zz, where the\n11\nstrain tensor \u0302zz = \u2202zuz with the atom displacement uz = \u2211 k(2\u03c1\u03c9kV ) \u22121/2(b\u0302k + b\u0302 \u2020 k)e\nikz. Here bzz is the magnetoelastic coupling coefficient, \u03c1 is the mass density of the magnet, V is the volume, and b\u0302k (b\u0302 \u2020 k) is the annihilation (creation) operator of phonon mode with wavevector k. The phonon follows the linear dispersion relation \u03c9k = c|k| with c being the speed of sound. By substituting the HP transformation of magnons (Szj = S \u2212 a\u0302 \u2020 j a\u0302j) and the quantized phonon mode into H\u0302int, the interaction Hamiltonian can be quantized as\nH\u0302int = \u2211 j g(\u03c9k)a\u0302 \u2020a\u0302 [ b\u0302ke ikRj \u2212 b\u0302\u2020ke \u2212ikRj ] , (42)\nwhere we have transformed to a discrete space (z \u2192 Rj) and g(\u03c9k) = \u22122iSbzzk/ \u221a 2\u03c1\u03c9kV is the coupling coefficient of magnons and phonons, which depends on the phonon frequency. Compared with the relaxation process discussed in Sec. III, now the magnon density instead of magnon creation/annihilation operator is coupled to the bath. We will soon see this will result in pure dephasing of magnons without relaxation.\nAfter a Fourier transform of magnon operator a\u0302j = 1/ \u221a N \u2211 k a\u0302ke\nikRj , we simplify the interaction Hamiltonian (42) as\nH\u0302int = a\u0302\u2020a\u0302 \u2211 k g(\u03c9k)(b\u0302k \u2212 b\u0302\u2020k), (43)\nwhere a\u0302 \u2261 a\u0302k0 is the mode of interest. Here we release the condition of momentum conservation, which may be caused by defects, disorders, grain boundaries or other fluctutations which allows violation of momentum conservation30,31. Now the system and bath operators read\ns = a\u0302\u2020a\u0302,\u0393 = \u2211 k g(\u03c9k)(b\u0302k \u2212 b\u0302\u2020k).

(45)\nBy substituting s\u0303 and \u0393\u0303 into the generalized master equation (4), we end up with a similar form of dynamic equation as Eq. (39), but with the dephasing coefficient\n\u03badp = 8(Sbzz)\n2kBT\n\u03c1d2c3 .

            "text": "In conclusion, we have presented a master equation approach to address the relaxation and dephasing of\nmagnons in both ferromagnetis and antiferromagnets. Employing this approach, we identified both local and collective dissipation channels of magnons and demonstrated that reduction of noise in spin components below the symmetric limit is a low temperature phenomenon, which makes it different from the classical precession of spins in an elliptical trajectory. We compared the prediction of magnon relaxation between the quantum formalism and classical dynamic equations. To make them consistent, we have to consider a hybrid bath model, where the magnons on each sublattice of an AFM have their own dissipation channel and also share a common channel mediated by conduction electrons or phonons for example. Up till now, we restricted most of our discussions to the relaxation of uniform precession modes and did not specify the physical origin of the bath explicitly. It would be meaningful to further consider relaxation of magnon modes by rigorously considering the magnonelectron in magnetic metals and magnon-phonon interactions in both metals and insulators. This will help to quantify the temperature and frequency dependence of the relaxation rate \u03ba in the master equation.\nBesides the master equation approach developed here, the Heisenberg-Langevin equation is another known approach to address the relaxation of quantum states18, which has already been utilized to deal with the relaxation of magnons in hybrid magnet-cavity system11. However, the collective dissipation channel through the interaction of magnons is usually not taken into account in this approach. As shown in Sec. III and IV, this collective relaxation channel may be essential to calibrate the squeezing and entanglement of magnons. In the future, it merits further research to study how the interaction of magnons influences the Langevin noise and compare the results presented here with that of the HeisenbergLangevin equation."
