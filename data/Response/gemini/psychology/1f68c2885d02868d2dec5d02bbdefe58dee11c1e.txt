1. **Investigate the potential of ANP0903 liposomes in combination with other anticancer agents.** The study demonstrated the efficacy of ANP0903 liposomes as a single agent in vitro. However, it would be interesting to explore whether the combination of ANP0903 liposomes with other anticancer drugs could lead to synergistic or additive effects. This could potentially improve the overall efficacy of treatment and reduce the risk of drug resistance.


2. **Evaluate the in vivo efficacy of ANP0903 liposomes in animal models of liver cancer.** The study only evaluated the efficacy of ANP0903 liposomes in vitro. To further validate the potential of this formulation, it is important to assess its efficacy in vivo using animal models of liver cancer. This would provide valuable information on the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and antitumor activity of ANP0903 liposomes in a more complex and physiologically relevant setting.


3. **Investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the antitumor activity of ANP0903 liposomes.** The study suggested that ANP0903 liposomes may exert their antitumor activity through proteasome inhibition. However, the exact molecular mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Further studies are needed to elucidate the signaling pathways and cellular processes affected by ANP0903 liposomes. This knowledge could lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets and the development of more effective treatment strategies.


4. **Explore the potential of ANP0903 liposomes for targeted delivery to liver cancer cells.** The study used non-targeted PEGylated liposomes for the delivery of ANP0903. However, it would be interesting to investigate the use of targeted liposomes that can specifically deliver ANP0903 to liver cancer cells. This could potentially improve the efficacy of treatment and reduce systemic toxicity.


5. **Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ANP0903 liposomes in patients with liver cancer.** The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a new treatment option for patients with liver cancer. To achieve this, it is necessary to conduct clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ANP0903 liposomes in humans. These trials would provide critical information on the maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicities, and overall response rate of ANP0903 liposomes in patients with liver cancer.
