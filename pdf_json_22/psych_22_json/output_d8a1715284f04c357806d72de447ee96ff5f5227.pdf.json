    "abstractText": "Background: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is often diagnosed in adolescence, and most evidence\u2010based treatments for AN in young people involve the family. Family therapies for AN are intensive, outpatient treatments that utilise the parents as the primary resource in the young person\u2019s recovery. Research regarding family treatment for AN is often conducted in specialist settings\u2014with relatively little data reporting the translation of this specialised treatment into real\u2010world, non\u2010specialist settings. This systematic review and meta\u2010analysis aims to determine the efficacy of family treatments for adolescents with AN in specialist settings versus non\u2010specialist settings. Methods: This systematic review and meta\u2010analysis will be conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta\u2010analyses guidelines. Retrospective cohort studies, pilot studies, case series, randomised controlled trials and qualitative investigations that present original data and investigated the efficacy of family treat\u2010 ments for adolescents with AN in either a specialist or non\u2010specialist setting will be included in the review. Data will be extracted by two reviewers and study quality will be assessed. The primary outcome, change in weight, will be used to determine via meta\u2010analysis and, depending on study heterogeneity, subgroup analysis or meta\u2010regression whether there is a statistically significant subgroup difference between specialist and non\u2010specialist treatment set\u2010 tings. The review will also consider changes in eating disorder symptomology and related constructs. Discussion: Results from this review will help determine if there is a difference in the efficacy of family treatments for adolescent AN in specialist versus non\u2010specialist treatment settings, primarily in relation to weight recovery. This, in turn, will inform the translation of evidence\u2010based interventions that are generally studied and implemented within specialist centres into the non\u2010specialist health care system.",

            "text": "Characterised by an excessive preoccupation with weight and shape, food restriction, weight loss, and malnutrition, anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe illness with numerous physical and psychological health impacts [1]. Although observed across the entire lifespan, AN is often first diagnosed during adolescence with an average duration\n*Correspondence: ashlea.hambleton@sydney.edu.au\n1 InsideOut Institute, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nillness of 5\u20137\u00a0 years [2]. AN holds the highest mortality rate of all psychiatric conditions; a consequence of a heightened rate of suicide and medical complications [3, 4].\nConcerningly, young people are particularly susceptible to the physical impacts of the illness, with complications from malnutrition and compensatory behaviours which includes growth retardation, osteoporosis, amenorrhea, and changes in brain structure [5]. Given the seriousness of the illness, treatment must be delivered efficiently and effectively. Although effective treatment of AN in young people remains an area of clinical and research need, the consensus remains that treatment is most effective when including the family. Several models, including a manualised form known as family-based treatment (FBT) [6] or family therapy for AN (FT-AN) (sometimes referred to as Maudsley Family Therapy (MFT)) [7, 8] have garnered an evidence base as the recommended treatment for adolescent AN [5, 9].\nFT (herein encompassing FBT, FT-AN and MFT) is an intensive, outpatient treatment that utilises the family as the primary resource towards the goal of getting the young person with AN well. The initial focus of treatment is weight restoration and disrupting ED behaviours via the parents/guardians. As weight restoration and behavioural symptom resolution are facilitated, less parental authority is typically required, and parents may gradually restore autonomy over eating back to the adolescent. Remission rates are particularly promising for adolescents with short illness duration [10\u201312]. The average remission rate for all participants at the end of FBT is approximately 50% [10, 13\u201315], and 75% of young people demonstrate improvement in weight and eating-related symptomatology at the end of FBT [8, 11]. Few studies have explored the long-term outcomes for FT; however preliminary evidence suggests that treatment effects are maintained for up to 5\u00a0 years [16, 17]. However further replication in larger samples is needed.\nThe efficacy of FT so far has been examined in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews [10]; however, these results are constrained to specialised settings such as university research units or specialist hospitals. Indeed, most research regarding the efficacy of psychological and behavioural treatments for AN (across the lifespan) has taken place within specialist, research-led settings [18], and so generalisability to those not included in trial eligibility criteria is limited. In an effort to bridge the research-practice gap, a growing body of literature (reports and case series) has reported the effectiveness outcomes of FT in non-specialist settings (i.e., digitally, in clinical practice, general practice, and community health settings) [19\u201322]. However, these results have not been synthesised systematically. This\nlack of translation to \u2018real-world\u2019 prevents a fair evaluation of the effectiveness of FT for AN in non-specialist settings, which is necessary, given this is where much of the population accesses treatment [18, 23].\nThis systematic review will gather and organise evidence from a diverse range of studies to critically evaluate the efficacy of FT in specialist compared to non-specialist settings. The current protocol outlines the methods of our investigation, in accordance with the PRISMA checklist [24]. This systematic review\u2019s primary aim is to determine if there is a difference in the efficacy of FT for AN in specialist versus non-specialist treatment settings. A secondary aim is to evaluate the methodological quality of included studies. We hope that findings from this review will inform the translation of evidence-based interventions that are generally studied and implemented within specialist centres into the non-specialist health care system. Further, it is anticipated that the outcomes derived from non-specialist settings may inform the future review and development of specialist protocols, that is, what can be learned from how these treatments are implemented in the \u2018real world\u2019."

Sufficient data are required to calculate effect sizes (e.g., M, SD, and/or, n at pre-treatment, posttreatment or follow up). Thus, a pre-treatment and at least one post-treatment or follow-up assessment are necessary.\nSecondary Outcomes: Changes in associated eating disorder psychopathology and non-eating disorder psychopathology will be reviewed as secondary outcomes, should there be sufficient data. Examples of likely secondary outcome variables include changes in global eating disorder symptomology, restriction, compensatory behaviours (exercise, purging), shape and/or weight (body image) concerns, as well as changes in depression and anxiety/distress severity, quality of life and daily functioning."

Essentially, a specialist setting is one that has been developed solely for the research and treatment of AN.\nNon-specialist settings are defined as those where FT has been delivered in community health settings, online/ telehealth or private practices. While FT may have been\ndelivered by specialist clinicians trained in FT, the setting itself is not a specialist research/clinical centre."

            "text": "This systematic review aims to determine and identify any differences in the efficacy of FT for AN in specialist versus non-specialist settings. Much of the existing peer-reviewed evidence base for the treatment of AN has emerged from RCTs within specialised clinical research settings. However, individuals with AN and their families typically seek treatment from local community settings, often disconnected from specialist multi-disciplinary teams. Further, many young people presenting to these non-specialist services also experience significant comorbidities, such as suicidal ideation, self-harm or psychotic symptoms, that may have meant they were excluded from clinical trials [29]. Thus, it is worthwhile to determine the efficacy of FT for this \u2018real-world\u2019 population group.\nThis method has several limitations that should be considered during data collection, analysis and interpretation. To capture the scope of work that has been completed regarding the specialist family treatment of adolescent AN, we have utilised broad eligibility criteria. However, this will also introduce numerous confounding variables that must be considered and managed. There are several strengths to this method. We will include a broad range of study designs to capture non-specialist settings and provide a complete overview of the literature. Secondly, we will conduct a thorough quality\nassessment of all included studies using an established assessment methodology. To facilitate transparency, the full search strategy that will be used to find relevant studies has been made available, and all data extracted from included studies will be published with the final manuscript.\nThis systematic review will provide a detailed summary of the effectiveness of FT for adolescent AN in specialist and non-specialist settings. The meta-analysis will further detail the effectiveness outcomes, and what, if any, differences because of treatment setting ought to be considered. We hope that findings from this review will inform the research-treatment gap, with learnings regarding: (1) how effective are the treatments tested within labs and specialist settings when they are implemented into the very population they were designed to treat (the \u2018real world\u2019), and, (2) how future treatment protocols can be informed by the outcomes from non-specialist settings.\nAbbreviations AN: Anorexia nervosa; AAN: Atypical anorexia nervosa; ED: Eating disorder; FBT: Family based treatment; FT\u2011AN: Family therapy for anorexia nervosa; MFT: Maudsley family therapy; PRISMA: Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta\u2011analyses; RCT : Randomised controlled trial.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s40337\u2011 022\u2011 00645\u20113.\nAdditional file\u00a01: Systematic Review Search Strategy.\nAcknowledgements No additional acknowledgements.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions AH wrote the initial manuscript; PA assisted with methodology design, and all authors edited and approved the final manuscript.\nFunding Not applicable.\nAvailability of data and materials Not applicable\u2014all citations provided."
