    "abstractText": "Theaflavins (TFs) are good for health because of their bioactivities. Enzymatic synthesis of TFs has garnered much attention; however, the source and activity of the enzymes needed limit their wide application. In this study, a microbial polyphenol oxidase from Bacillus megaterium was screened for the synthesis of theaflavin-3,3\u2032-digallate (TFDG). Based on structural and mechanistic analyses of the enzyme, the O-O bond dissociation was identified as the rate-determining step. To address this issue, a transition state (TS) conformation optimization strategy was adopted to stabilize the spatial conformation of the O-O bond dissociation, which improved the catalytic efficiency of tyrosinase. Under the optimum transformation conditions of pH 4.0, temperature 25 \u25e6C, (\u2212)-epigallocatechin gallate/epicatechin gallate molar ratio of 2:1, and time of 30 min, Mu4 (BmTyrV218A/R209S) produced 960.36 mg/L TFDG with a 44.22% conversion rate, which was 6.35-fold higher than that of the wild type. Thus, the method established has great potential in the synthesis of TFDG and other TFs.",

            "text": "Theaflavin (TFs) is a flavanol with a benzotoketone ring system produced by the condensation of gallocatechin and catechin [1]. TFs have various health benefits, including antioxidant, antiobesity, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties, and they can also prevent fatty liver and cardiovascular diseases [2\u20136]. TFs are naturally derived from the enzymatic oxidation of catechin monomers in fresh green tea leaves during the fermentation process. In addition to the four main compounds, namely theaflavin (TF), theaflavin-3,3\u2032digallate (TFDG), theaflavin-3\u2032-gallate (TF-3\u2032-G), and theaflavin-3-gallate (TF-3-G), more than 30 species of theaflavins have been found [7]. Among these, TFDG is generally regarded as the most effective bioactive component [8]. The production of TFDG involves direct extraction, chemical oxidation, or enzymatic methods [9]. However, the direct extraction is not suitable for industrial-scale production because of high costs, wastage of resources, and a low extraction rate. The chemical oxidation synthesis method has disadvantages such as a low extraction rate of TFs and a complicated operational process. Furthermore, according to the European and United States legislation, chemically synthesized additives cannot be used in cosmetics, foods, or beverages [10]. Consequently, the enzymatic synthesis of TFDG has garnered increasing attention, which is a natural synthesis method and can greatly decrease the production cost [11]. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidases (PODs) are two groups of enzymes that are important for the synthesis of TFs. Zhang et al. [12] integrated transcriptome and\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3831. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28093831 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3831 2 of 14\nmetabolite analysis of tea leaves to identify PPO and POD genes that may be involved in TF production during tea processing. The results showed that PPOs mainly catalyze the oxidation of catechins to TFs, whereas PODs catalyze the oxidation of catechins to TFs and further catalyze the rapid polymerization of TFs to thearubigins. Therefore, PPO are the key enzymes in TF synthesis. To synthesize TFDG, purified PPOs from tea leaves were used as catalysts, which obtained a final yield of 11 mg/L at pH 5.5 and 33 \u25e6C [13]. In a different study, PPOs taken from pear fruits were purified, immobilized, and applied to the synthesis of TFDG, using (\u2212)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and epicatechin gallate (ECG) as substrates, and resulted in a maximum yield of 42.23% [11]. These previous studies have made remarkable progress in the development and utilization of plant PPO. However, the process of isolating and purifying PPO directly from plant tissues is complex and inefficient. Therefore, identifying new and efficient PPO for TF production is important. Computational strategies have emerged in recent years that become an effective and cost-effective way to obtain target mutants by virtual screening. Rational design is based on structural analysis and applies various computational strategies to design novel enzymes or to optimize protein properties using a limited number of mutations [14,15]. This approach has achieved remarkable success in industrial biology and synthetic biology. The transition state (TS) is a metastable state during a chemical reaction that bridges reactants and products. Enzymatic catalysis and TS theory indicate that the catalytic effect of enzymes is owed to the TS, which binds to the enzyme much more tightly than the substrate [16]. Based on this TS theory, much progress has been made in de novo enzyme design and protein modification. Therefore, the use of simple and efficient computational methods is highly preferable for enzyme engineering. Combining the advantages of directed evolution and rational design, we used a method of enzyme redesign based on the Rosetta enzyme design for the computer simulation of stable TS in order to improve oxidation efficiency. In this study, a microbial PPO named BmTyr was screened. Based on the analysis of its structure and mechanism, the O-O bond dissociation (TS2) was found to be the rate-determining step. Therefore, we proposed a strategy to optimize the conformation of TS2, based on the transition state and structure. Compared with the traditional approach of random mutation, which required a lot of screening work, this strategy effectively reduced the workload. The best variant was BmTyrV218A/R209S, which increased the specific activity by 4.67-fold and Vmax/Km by 6.97-fold toward EGCG. Finally, the optimization of the transformation conditions obtained a titer of 960.36 mg/L TFDG."

The selected PPOs were subcloned into the pET28a (+) vector and were heterologously expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). SDS\u2013PAGE analyses were performed to observe soluble PPO proteins (Figure 1a, which were then purified to produce TFDG).

The O-O bond cleavage was a prohibitively large barrier for this reaction. MD simulations showed that the distance between the -O11H of the EGCG and the O1 of the bridging oxygen atom of the active center was 4.66 \u00b1 0.57 \u00c5 (Figures S8), which made the hydride transfer and proton transfer difficult. Thus, optimizing this critical step required the optimum conformation of TS2.\nFigure 2. The construction process of the theoretical complex structure.

            "text": "To determine the optimum c nformation of TS2, restrained MD simulations were conducted. First, the MD state model was cons ructed by defining geometric criteria on the basis of the existing M3 and pr vious studies on the mechanism [20]. During the restrained MD calculati ns, the coordinates of the active site atoms were fixed. Subsequently, stable conformations were selected by cluster analysis to construct the active site cluster model, namely the TS2 state model (Figure S5). A total of 15 residues (M61, E158, M184, E195, F197, P201, N205, R209, Q214, M215, G216, V217, V218, A221, and F227) within 5 \u00c5 of the TS2 were selected for the subsequent Rosetta enzyme design (Figure 4a). During Rosetta enzyme design, to accommodate the large backbone changes introduced at each step, we used PSSMs to limit amino acid choices to identities that were common in the multiple-sequence alignment (Figure S6) [23]. Thus, 119 mutants were designed in this study. Computational mutation scanning was performed to predict the effects of each mutation (\u2206\u2206G).

The data represent mean \u00b1 s.d., as determined from three independent experiments.\nThe 22 variants were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3), which were purified and tested\nfor TFDG production (Figure S7). Compared with the TFDG titers of WT, 19 of the 22 variants showed improved TFDG titers, which confirmed the effectiveness of this method. Among the 19 improved variants, Mu1 (BmTyrR209S), Mu2 (BmTyrV217L), and Mu3 (BmTyrV218A) showed an almost two-fold increase in TFDG titer; Mu3, the most efficient mutant, showed a 2.43-fold increase in TFDG titer (438.19 mg/L) compared with that of WT. To further increase this activity, R209S and V217L were combined with V218A, resulting in the variants Mu4 (BmTyrV218A/R209S) and Mu5 (BmTyrV218A/V217L). Mu4 showed the highest TFDG titer (675.30 mg/L), corresponding to a 4.29-fold increase compared with that of the WT (Figure 4b). The kinetic parameters of WT and its variants are shown in Table 1. Compared with WT, Mu4 showed increased activity toward ECG and EGCG. The specific activities of Mu4 toward ECG and EGCG, which were 51.14 and 86.58 U/mg, respectively, were 3.68- and 4.67-fold higher than that of the WT. The Vmax/Km of Mu4 toward ECG and EGCG were 14.59 U and 27.17 U min\u22121 mg\u22121 mM\u22121, respectively, which were 6.05- and 6.97-fold higher than that of the WT. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the increased enzymatic activity, MD simulations were performed on the Mu4\u2013EGCG complex. Compared with BmTyr\u2013EGCG, the hydride transfer distance of the Mu4\u2013EGCG complex was shortened from 4.66 \u00b1 0.57 to 3.02 \u00b1 0.31 \u00c5 (Figures 5a,b and S8). This suggests that the distance between the -O11H of the EGCG and the O1 of the bridging oxygen atom of the active center was shortened in Mu4. Furthermore, V218A and R209S eliminated steric hindrance (Figure 5c,d). The side chain residues of valine and arginine in Mu4 were larger than that of the WT, which increased the steric hindrance of the transition state. Providing more space for the substrate, where the catalytic residues are present, is conducive to the stability of the transition state, which may enable the release of the products.\nFigure 4.

Plant PPOs are not conducive to the industrialization of tea pigment production because it requires a large number of tea leaves to meet the application requirements. Furthermore, there were large differences in the enzyme composition of plants in different seasons, and their effects on the synthesis of TFs were inconsistent. The large-scale production of TFs requires a stable enzyme source. We selected seven functionally known microbial PPOs from the NCBI database via data mining. The recombinant strain BmTyr was selected to improve the biological preparation of TFDG because it has the advantages of a simple culture method, abundant raw material sources, high enzyme yield, and good enzyme production stability.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3831 9 of 14\nA transition-state conformation optimization strategy was adopted, which provided an effective tool for obtaining beneficial mutations in BmTyr to improve TF synthesis. Many strategies have been adopted to engineer proteins and to improve their properties. For example, Zhou et al. [25] obtained activating mutations from BmTyr after screening almost 20,000 colonies for random mutations. This approach required enormous screening efforts. In this study, BmTyr was efficiently engineered on the basis of the Rosetta enzyme design for the computer simulation of stable TS to improve oxidation efficiency. A total of 19 beneficial mutants were obtained from the designed library (22 mutants) that produced TFDG. Compared with the traditional random mutation, this strategy effectively reduces the workload. In a different study, theaflavins were synthesized by extracting polyphenol oxidase from eggplants. The results showed that the total content of theaflavins could reach 40.7 mg under optimum reaction conditions [26]. Ngure, F. M. et al. [27] used PPO from tea to oxidize catechins, and the final theaflavin content reached 26.99 \u00b5mol/g. PPOs from snow lotus fruits have also been used to oxidize catechins to form theaflavins. The final estimate of theaflavins in the reaction system was 65 \u00b5M dry weight/h [28]. Under the catalysis of the optimum mutant BmTyrV218A/R209S, the titer of TFDG reached 960.36 mg/L with 44.22% conversion, which was 6.35-fold higher than that of the WT. These results showed the effectiveness of our strategy and may be useful for improving the properties of other enzymes. Despite the abovementioned results, several factors restrict the production of TFs. Although the TFDG generation rate is high, the industrial application of free enzymes is impeded because they are either inactivated or cannot be recovered for reuse. Immobilized enzymes can effectively overcome the limitations of free enzymes. A suitable carrier should be found to immobilize PPO, which can make the enzyme reaction continuous and automatic, reduce production costs, and improve efficiency. Our ongoing study will address these issues and improve the utilization of BmTyr."

X-ray diffraction data were collected using a Bruker D8 QUEST diffractometer, and the data sets were indexed, integrated, and merged using XDS [29]. The structure of BmTyr was solved using the molecular replacement, with the protein structure of 3nm8 as the search model. Iterative cycles of model building and refinement were performed in Coot [30] and Refmac [31] programs. The data collection and refinement statistics of the apo-BmTyr crystal structure are listed in Table S4.

            "text": "The initial structure of BmTyr was obtained using Bacillus megaterium as a template (PDB ID:3nm8 [32]). Based on 3nm8, a reactive binding mode, namely BmTyr (M1), was created. The protonation states of the charged residues were determined at a constant pH of 5.0 on the basis of the pKa calculations using H++ [33] while taking into account the local hydrogen bonding network. The His residues were assigned as HID. Asp and Glu residues were deprotonated, whereas Lys and Arg were protonated. The prepared protein was neutralized by adding Na+ ions and solvated into a truncated octahedral TIP3P [34] water box with a 10 \u00c5 buffer distance on each side. The M1 system consisted of 27,473 atoms. The system was equilibrated through a series of minimization steps that was interspersed by short molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, during which the restraints on the protein backbone heavy atoms were released gradually (with a force constant of 10, 2, 0.1, and 0 kcal/mol\u00b7\u00c52). The system was gradually heated up to 303 K in 50 ps in which harmonic potentials were used to positionally restrain the protein backbone heavy atoms (with a force constant of 10 kcal/mol\u00b7\u00c52). Finally, the standard unrestrained MD simulation with periodic boundary condition at 303 K and 1 atm was carried out for up to 100 ns. Based on the dynamically stable BmTyr (M2) binary complex structure determined by MD simulations, EGCG was docked into the active center to obtain the possible binding mode of EGCG (BmTyr\u2013EGCG, M3). A representative pre-equilibrated structure of BmTy\u2013EGCG was used as a template to create the starting coordinates of Mu4\u2013EGCG by changing the\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3831 11 of 14\ntwo mutated residues (V218A/R209S). To check for statistical convergence, each simulation was carried out in triplicate with different initial atomic velocities that were randomly generated according to the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution."

EGCG was fully optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level using the Gaussian 16 [36] package, and docked into the active site of each group representative snapshot. Molecular docking was performed by the Lamarckian genetic algorithm local search method in AutoDock 4.2 and AutoDockTools-1.5.6 [37]. The docking approach was employed on a rigid receptor conformation. One-hundred independent docking runs were undertaken. Reasonable conformations were then selected as the binding conformations for MD simulations."

The partial charges of EGCG were fitted with HF/6-31G(d) calculations, and the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) [38,39] protocol was implemented by the Antechamber module in the Amber 16 package [40]. Each system was initially neutralized with Na+ counter ions and solvated with TIP3P [34] water in a truncated octahedron box at a 10 \u00c5 buffer distance. The resulting systems M2, M3, and Mu4\u2013EGCG contained 27,473, 27,188, and 27,230 atoms, respectively. Next, each system was equilibrated with a series of minimization that was interspersed by short MD simulations, during which the restraints on the protein backbone heavy atoms were released gradually (with force constants of 10, 2, 0.1, and 0 kcal/mol\u00b7\u00c52). The system was then gradually heated from 0 to 303 K for 50 ps, in which a 10 kcal/(mol\u00b7\u00c52) restraint was applied to heavy atoms on the protein backbone. Finally, an extensive MD simulation of 50 ns was performed at constant temperature and pressure. The pressure was maintained at 1 atm and coupled with isotropic position scaling. The temperature was controlled at 303 K using the Berendsen thermostat method [41]. Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method [42], and a 12 \u00c5 cutoff was applied to both PME and van der Waals (vdW) interactions. A time step of 2 fs was employed along with the SHAKE algorithm [43] for hydrogen, and periodic boundary conditions were used. The atomic positions were stored every 2 ps for further analysis. Each system was checked for stability (structure, energy, and temperature fluctuations) and convergence (root mean square deviations (RMSD) of the structures)."
