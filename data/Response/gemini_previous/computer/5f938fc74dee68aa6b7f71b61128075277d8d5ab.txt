1. **Investigate the effects of different peptide block lengths on the optical properties of ALucs.** The study found that the length of the appended peptide blocks influenced the BL intensities of the new ALucs. Future research could explore how the length of these blocks affects other optical properties, such as the BL spectrum and color. This knowledge could be used to engineer ALucs with specific optical properties for different applications.


2. **Explore the use of ALucs in bioimaging applications.** The new ALucs have several properties that make them attractive for use in bioimaging applications, including their strong BL intensities, redshifted BL spectra, and ability to be genetically encoded. Future research could investigate the use of ALucs to image various biological processes in living cells and animals.


3. **Develop new single-chain BL probes using ALucs.** The study demonstrated the utility of ALucs in the construction of single-chain BL probes. Future research could explore the use of ALucs to develop new single-chain BL probes for a variety of applications, such as protein-protein interaction studies, enzyme activity assays, and cellular signaling studies.


4. **Investigate the use of ALucs in protein fragment complementation assays (PCAs).** The study also showed that ALucs can be used in PCAs. Future research could explore the use of ALucs to develop new PCAs for a variety of applications, such as studying protein-protein interactions, protein localization, and protein conformational changes.


5. **Engineer ALucs with improved stability and expression levels.** The new ALucs have several advantages over natural marine luciferases, but they could be further improved by engineering them to be more stable and to have higher expression levels. Future research could focus on developing new ALucs with these improved properties, which would make them even more useful for a variety of applications.
