As a promising protective device, Z-source Circuit Breaker (ZCB) has some unique good features over other approaches. But, under the circumstance of slow-developing faults, the ZCB might be \u201cblind\u201d and fails to protect circuits. In this paper, a new method of coordinating ZCB and fuse is developed to specify the fuse properly to compensate ZCB\u2019s functionality and thus introduce a complete \u201cthermal-magnetic\u201d function of a hybrid ZCB-fuse circuit breaker. By analyzing the currentlimiting features of ZCB and fuse and their interactions, two constraints are identified for the proposed coordination method and two relevant thresholds of melting energy in fuse are formulated. A five-step coordination method is developed and verified by simulation tests with various fault current levels and fault changing time. It is proven that, by following the proposed coordination method, the fuse coordinates well to the ZCB as backup protection under the designated peak tolerable fault current. This research work helps to increase the reliability of short-circuit protection with ZCBs in modern dc power systems.

            "heading": "A. BACKGROUND OF DC POWER NETWORK PROTECTION",
            "text": "Nowadays, more and more renewable energy resources in dc format are developed and installed in the modern electric power grids, via HVDC transmission networks, MVDC distribution networks, and microgrids and nanogrids. The dcformat resources include but are not limited to solar panels, dc-tied wind generators, fuel cells, ultra-capacitors, and rechargeable batteries. At the same time, the technologies of modern pure electric vehicles driven by batteries are developing rapidly to promote the utilization of green energy. Therefore, it is predictable that there would be a grand expansion of dc power networks with increasingly installed dc resources and loads.\nDue to historical reasons, ac power networks dominate the current electric power grids. The protection solutions of ac systems are mature and protect ac power networks well.\nUnfortunately, those protection solutions for ac systems cannot be applied to dc systems directly. Due to the lack of a natural zero-crossing point, the opening of an arc-based circuit breaker cannot itself extinguish the arc generated in dc systems [1]. Because of that, extinguishing such a high arc from a dc short-circuit current would be difficult and also significantly increase the cost of maintenance and reduce the life span of the breaker [2-4]. Therefore, it is essential and critical to address the short-circuit protection of dc power networks effectively, to support the broader applications of green energy and relevant technologies.\nSo far there have been several proposed solutions of dc short-circuit protection to get rid of the arc problem in dc circuits, as shown in Fig. 1. One method is to use overrated ac circuit breakers. With the excessive arc-extinguishing ability, the ac breakers can cut off faulty lines. The \u201coverrated\u201d solution in this method is usually expensive and bulky in field applications [5]. Later, another method of using solid-state circuit breakers was proposed for dc circuit protection. Based\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Different from traditional ac circuit breakers, the solid-state circuit breakers limit shortcircuit current and block power supply by turning the solidstate component into high-resistance condition, other than opening contacts and thus cutting off faulty lines physically.\nRecently, peers paid more attention to hybrid circuit breakers to meet the desire for better dc power network protection. New solutions were being explored continuously by mixing the superiorities of various components and approaches. In 2020, a novel current injection dc circuit breaker (DCCB) integrating the current commutation and energy dissipation was proposed in [7]. The symbiosis between the magnetic induction current commutation module (MICCM) and metal oxide varistor (MOV) eliminates the disadvantages in the conventional current injection scheme, offering a cost-effective solution for isolating faults while preserving large current breaking capability. Based on the complementary advantages of IGBTs and IGCTs, paper [8] proposed a mixture solid-state switch (MSS) for HCBs that uses the switching action of several IGBTs to create a lowcurrent condition that favors the turning OFF of large-scale series-connected IGCTs. The passive resonance DC interrupting properties of CO2/O2 mixed gas with superconducting fault current-limiting technology were studied in [9]. With the development of wide-bandgap (WBG) power semiconductor devices, paper [10] identified and validated the use of ultrafast silicon carbide (SiC) junction field effect transistor (JFET)-based self-powered solid-state circuit breakers (SSCBs) as the enabling protective device for a 340 Vdc residential dc community microgrid. Particularly for HVDC transmission systems, in 2020 paper [11] proposed a hybrid DC circuit breaker module for reciprocating HVDC circuit breaker topology, whose branch connections can switch between series and parallel modes to limit the rising rate and interrupt the DC fault currents. Also, a modified hybrid dc breaker and a half-bridge modular multilevel converter (MMC) were employed to interrupt the dc fault current in a high-voltage direct current transmission system [12]."

            "heading": "B. BRIEFS, LIMIT, AND A PROPOSED COORDINATION METHOD OF ZCB",
            "text": "Compared to other solutions, Z-source Circuit Breaker (ZCB) has some notable features in fault current limitation and normal system operation:\n1. Ultra-fast action of fault current limitation in \u00b5s\nlevel;\n2. Controllability in the fault clearance time; 3. No huge current spike right after the short-circuit\noccurrence;\n4. Low power loss during normal system operation; 5. Ability to handle high voltage high current cases; 6. Low cost in manufacturing and maintenance.\nAs a type of solid-state circuit breaker, the resonant circuit in ZCB enables the ultra-fast action of current limitation. And the fault clearance time can be adjusted by specifying the resonant circuit parameters properly. Based on the operational principle of ZCB, there is no huge spike in fault current right after a fault occurs because a) the resonant circuit responds to the ramp of increasing fault current other than the absolute fault current level; b) the resonant circuit provides anti-directional current to limit the increase of fault current and turn off SCR. Therefore, ZCBs alleviate the shocks of fault current to the protected devices/networks, which would avoid potential damage and lengthen the lifetime of the equipment. In addition, ZCB adopts SCR as the main power semiconductor device, which introduces low power loss during normal operation of dc systems and enables its high-voltage highcurrent ratings and low cost in system applications.\nDerived from the Z-source inverter (initially introduced by F.Z. Peng [13]), ZCB is a thyristor (i.e., SCR) based power electronic circuit breaker, which can operate autonomously with low maintenance and can interrupt fault currents in dc format [14]. After that, some ZCB technologies have been studied. And recently, a bidirectional Z-source breaker using coupled inductor was discussed and experimentally validated for low-voltage DC microgrid applications in 2020 [15, 16]. At the same time, another novel design of the Z-source circuit breaker topology was presented to minimize ON-state losses of the protection device, by applying an ultrafast mechanical switch to commutate the fault current and improve the controllability of the circuit breaker [17]. In paper [18], an active Z-source DC circuit breaker was proposed by the combination of IGBT and SCR. It has advantages of simple and compact topology, economical design, low conduction losses, and active and bidirectional current breaking capacity. In 2021, a new bidirectional Z-source circuit breaker with an O-shaped impedance network was introduced to guarantee the reliable operation of DC microgrids [19]. A new specification method was developed for calculating Z-source capacitances to ensure the turnoff action of SCR in ZCB\u2019s practice for realistic DC network protection [20]. In 2022, paper [21] developed a modified ZCB with an IGBT to discharge capacitor between interruption cycles, to address the unwanted current issues during commissioning and reclosing.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\nVOLUME XX, 2017 9\nHowever, it is noticed that ZCB can only protect the fastchanging fault current with a high ramp, which has been demonstrated in the former studies. That means the ZCB would be \u201cblind\u201d to the slow-developing fault currents such as the insulation failure due to excessive heat. Another example of the undetectable scene is the sustainable resistance of a moist tree branch in ambient environment: initially, only a small current flows and starts to dry out the wood; within a few minutes the resistance of wood gradually reduces and thus more severe short circuit occurs. Typically, for a reliable fault protection scheme, both \u201cthermal\u201d and \u201cmagnetic\u201d functions are inevitable for circuit breakers. By examining its characteristics, ZCB has quick limitation to fast-changing faults, which is analog to the \u201cmagnetic\u201d function in traditional \u201cthermal-magnetic\u201d AC circuit breakers but lacks the \u201cthermal\u201d function.\nIn this paper, it is proposed to adopt fuses to compensate for ZCB\u2019s functionality and thus introduce a complete \u201cthermalmagnetic\u201d function of a hybrid ZCB-fuse circuit breaker. This method would increase the reliability of short-circuit protection with ZCBs in realistic dc power systems. The following sections are organized as follows: Section II introduces the topology and modeling of ZCB and fuse briefly; Section III explains the proposed method of coordinating ZCBs and fuses; and finally, Section IV proves the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method by simulation tests and relevant analysis, which lead to a conclusion drawn in Section V."

            "text": "Up to date, there is a couple of topologies and modeling for ZCB, which are based on the principle of resonant circuits. Generally, a ZCB has one or two SCRs and a resonant circuit consisting of several passive electrical components, i.e., inductors, capacitors, and diodes. The SCRs are halfcontrolled power semiconductor devices and provide the main power flow path in power delivery. When a fault occurs, the high-frequency components in the fault current will trigger the resonant circuit in ZCB and thus cause the interaction of L-C elements and SCR. Due to the interaction, the SCR commutes off naturally with the help of the L-C resonant circuit.\nIn this research, the modeling of the Inter-Cross-Connected Bi-directional Z-source Circuit Breaker (ICC-BZCB) is applied here. Compared to other ZCB topologies, ICC-BZCB\nhas a high-efficient power delivery for high-power applications [22]-[24]. Fig. 2 shows the topology of ICCBZCB. ICC-BZCB consists of two SCRs, two inductors, three capacitors, and two diodes to form a connecting link between the source and the load [20, 22]. The load is considered as a parallel-connected RC circuit. Because of the symmetrical structure in the circuit, the ICC-BZCB can block fault currents from both directions, i.e., from the power source side and the load side. During normal operation, the power flows along the path of \u201cVs \u2212 L1 \u2212 T1 \u2212 D2 \u2212 L2 \u2212 RL\u201d; when there is a fault occurring as shown in Fig. 2, the SCR \u201cT1\u201d commutes off naturally due to the reverse current flow from the triggered resonant circuit. More details of the transient analysis can be referred to [20, 22]. Based on this topology, the modeling of ZCB is built up for the simulation tests of coordination in Section IV."

Fuses are typically applied as a backup of circuit breakers and demonstrate simple structure, fast response, and high reliability in electric circuit protection. During normal operation, a fuse demonstrates very small resistance and is almost \u201cinvisible\u201d in an electric circuit; when a fault occurs and meets the threshold of melting energy, the fuse starts melting and cuts off the fault within a certain time. The period between the fault occurrence to its cutoff is defined as the total clearing time.\nThe total clearing time consists of two sequential periods - the melting time and the arcing time, as shown in Fig. 3. The melting time is defined as a period after the fault occurs and accumulates heat inside the fuse device. During the melting time, the fault current keeps increasing and stores heat inside the fuse device. At the end of this period, the fault current reaches its peak value; the stored heat hits the threshold of melting energy, the fuse starts melting, and gaps and arcs are generated inside the fuse device. The arcing time is defined as a period between the fuse starts melting and the fault current reaching zero. During the arcing time, the gaps expand due to the continuous melting of the fuse. The expanded gaps weaken arcs and finally extinguish the arcs to realize the circuit cutoff.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

When the desired tripping time of SCR (Ttripping) is 10 \u00b5s under a fault of 40 \u2126, the ZCB components are specified as: L1 = L2 = 1.23 mH, and C0 = C1 = C2 = 2.2 \u00b5F.

For the development of the new coordination method of ZCBs and fuses, there are wide-range variations in faults, in the aspects of the fault resistance and its developing time. It is impractical to emulate these variable faults in laboratory experiments. Therefore, simulation tests are applied here to verify the effectiveness of the proposed coordination method and support relevant discussions in this article.\nFig. 6 shows the simulation testbed of sole ZCB in the environment of Matlab/Simulink/Simscape.

In addition, a variable resistor is applied to emulate the behavior of a slowdeveloping variable fault. A control model of \u201cSpecification Control to Fault\u201d is implemented based on (3) and used to specify the resistance of the \u201cVariable Fault\u201d in Fig. 6.\n\ud835\udc58 = 1\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc53 \u2217\n1\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50\u210e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54 (3)\nwhere k is the fault conductance ramp; Rf is the fault resistance; Tchanging is the time length of fault changing time from its prefault resistance value to the final fault resistance value.\n40 \u2126.\nFig. 7 shows the specified ZCB\u2019s response to a fault of 40 \u2126. It is noticed that the fault current is cut off quickly with a spike of 6.5 A, which is smaller than its unlimited peak fault current of 9 A. Different from the other types of circuit breakers triggered by the high value of fault currents, ZCB responds to the changing rate of fault currents and thus there is no huge current spike right after the occurrence of shortcircuit phenomenon. Therefore, ZCB can effectively avoid the shocks of high fault current to the protected devices/networks, which would avoid potential damage and lengthen the lifetime of the equipment. Unfortunately, this notable features of ZCB in fault current limitation might be lost in some circumstances, e.g. the slow-developing faults studied in this article, as compared in Fig. 8.\nWhen the fault changing time exceeds its relevant desired tripping time of SCR, the fault current limitation of ZCB will be lost. Under the condition of 40-\u2126 fault resistance, the threshold of fault changing time equals the relevant desired tripping time of SCR, which is 10 \u00b5s according to the specification of the simulation testbed. Fig. 8 compares the fault currents and dc bus voltages when the fault changing time is 10 \u00b5s and 11 \u00b5s, respectively. From Fig. 8, it is noticed that when Tchanging is 10 \u00b5s the dc bus voltage reduces to zero gradually and the fault current drops to zero after a short transient within 0.5 ms, successfully. But, when Tchanging reaches a value of 11 \u00b5s, the slower-developing fault cannot trigger the ZCB\u2019s resonant circuit strong enough to turn off the SCR anymore. Under this condition, the fault current reaches its unlimited value of 9 A finally and thus the fault protection fails. Therefore, it is proven that ZCB fails to clear the fault when the fault changing time is too long and exceeds the threshold of 10 \u00b5s.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

            "text": "Based on the topology and flow chart of fuse modeling in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, a fuse model and its testbed are built here. The system parameters remain the same as in Section III.A, but the ICC-BZCB circuit in Fig. 6 is replaced with the fuse model. The purpose of this test is to verify the functionality and accuracy of the fuse model. The fuse model will be used to support the verification of the proposed coordination method in Section IV.\nFig. 9 shows the simulation testbed of sole fuse. The \u201cFuse Circuit\u201d block is modeled based on Fig. 4, with an RC time constant of 0.1 \u00b5s. The \u201cFuse Logic & Control\u201d block receives\nthe feedback current from a current sensor and generates the control signals to the two switches (i.e., Kfuse and Karc) in the \u201cFuse Circuit\u201d block.

The simulation results meet the expected fault clearance time in Table II, shown as the three red circles in Fig. 10. The function and accuracy of the fuse model are verified to support the evaluation of the proposed coordination method in Section IV.\nC. METHODOLOGY OF COORDINATING ZCB AND FUSE To achieve the coordination of ZCB and fuse in protection, the ZCB is used as a main protective device to take care of instantaneous and fast-changing faults and the fuse is used as a backup assistant to handle the cases of slow-developing faults. In this way, the combination of ZCB and fuse can provide a reliable protection scheme for all kinds of fault conditions.\nFor coordination, the fuse as a backup should not cause interference to the ZCB during protection operation. By analyzing the current-limiting features of ZCB and fuse, there are two constraints identified to avoid bad interaction between the two protective devices:\n1) The fuse should not be triggered before the fault resistance reaching to its maximum value: since the ZCB responds to the changing rate of fault currents, it has a possibility of being triggered at any time during the changing period of fault resistance. Therefore, the fuse must be specified to be triggered after the changing period of fault resistance. This is the first constraint of ZCB and fuse coordination;\n2) The ZCB should not mistrip the fuse: since ZCB is based on the principle of the L-C resonant circuit, there is an oscillation decaying current looking like a current tail after the ZCB is triggered to cut off fault currents. Due to the series connection of ZCB and fuse, the current tail might reach the threshold of melting energy in the fuse and thus trip the fuse by mistake. Therefore, the selected fuse must have a melting energy threshold high enough to avoid being mistripped by the current tail during the transient of fault current limited by ZCB. This is the second constraint of ZCB and fuse coordination.\nBased on the two identified constraints, the thresholds of melting energy in fuse are formulated as below:\nConstraint #1: for the formulation of the first constraint, Fig. 11 presents the fault current during its changing period. Due to the nature of the fault itself, the fault current may not increase at a constant slope as the actual line in Fig. 11. But, by considering the short changing time in microsecond level and neglecting the effect of pre-fault current, it is acceptable to use a triangle to calculate the melting energy accumulated in fuse, as the gray zone shown in Fig. 11. In this way, the melting energy threshold of the first constraint can be derived in (4).\n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc5a\u22121 \u2248 \u222b ( \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc39\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50\u210e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54 \u2217 \ud835\udc61)\n2\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50\u210e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54\n0\n= 1\n3 \u2217 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc39\n2 \u2217 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50\u210e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54 (4)\nwhere Em-1 is the melting energy threshold of the first constraint; IF is the unaltered fault current after the fault changing period; Tchanging is the length of the fault changing period.\nConstraint #2: for the second constraint, Fig. 12 presents the fault current during the transient of fault current limited by ZCB. After a fault occurs, the ZCB can cut off the fault within the total clearance time (TZCB). The total clearance time of ZCB consists of two periods: one is the required tripping time of SCR (Ttripping) specified in ZCB; the other one is the resonant oscillation time (Tres) determined by the internal L-C resonant circuit of ZCB. The oscillation decays rapidly in one period of the resonant frequency. In another aspect, during the pre-fault operation condition, the load current flows through the resonant inductors (L1 and L2). At the transient of fault occurrence, the currents through the resonant inductors remain unaltered. Depending on the topology of ICC-BZCB in Fig. 2, the peak current during fault clearance (Ilimit) is no more than four times the pre-fault load current theoretically. Similar to the constraint #1, a triangular zone is used to calculate the accumulated thermal energy during the current limitation\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

The fuse model is series-connected to the ZCB model to provide backup protection. The ZCB and fuse models are identical to the ones in Fig. 6 and Fig. 9, respectively. The subsystem of \u201cSpecification Control to Fault\u201d is identical to the one in Fig. 6c. The specification and parameters of the testbed models are summarized in Table III.\nAccording to the proposed coordination method, the parameters of ZCB components are specified as listed in Table III, for the desired tripping time of 10 \u00b5s. These parameters are used as a baseline and unaltered during the simulation tests. When the highest tolerable fault current is set to 27 A, it is found that the threshold of fault changing time (Tchanging) is 103 \u00b5s. Based on that, the first threshold of melting energy (Em-1) can be calculated as 19.97 \u00d7 10\u22123A2s, according to (4). And the second threshold of melting energy (Em-2) can be calculated as 19.39 \u00d7 10\u22123A2s, according to (5) and (6). The period of the resonant circuit (Tres) is 0.3 ms. Finally, the rating of the fuse can be specified with the maximum threshold of melting energy of 19.97 \u00d7 10\u22123A2s. During the simulation tests of system verification, all parameters identified from the coordination method remain unaltered. Only the fault resistance and the fault changing time are changed during tests. By performing a few sets of simulation tests, there are three possible scenarios at post fault:\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\nVOLUME XX, 2017 9\nScenario #1: the ZCB is triggered to cut off the fault current, while the fuse remaining closed. This is an ideal condition of ZCB protection activated and fuse stand by;\nScenario #2: the ZCB fails to be triggered, and the fuse is activated to cut off the fault current. This is a coordinative operation as the fuse provides a backup to the ZCB;\nScenario #3: Both the ZCB and fuse are activated to cut off the fault current. Under this condition, the coordinative protection of ZCB and fuse fails, which should be prevented.\nFig. 14 shows the dc bus voltages, SCR\u2019s current, and fuse status, in the three scenarios. For the fuse status, the \u201c1\u201d means \u201cactivated\u201d, and the \u201c0\u201d means \u201cclosed\u201d. In Fig. 14-a, the SCR\u2019s current drops to zero quickly and thus the fault current is cut off by ZCB successfully. In scenario #1, the fuse remains closed all the time. In Fig. 14-b, SCR fails to turn off and ZCB cannot limit the fault current anymore, which results in an increasing fault current in the circuit. In this case, when the fault current reaches about 15 A, the threshold of melting energy is touched and thus the fuse is activated to cut off the faulty line. In scenario #2, the fuse provides a backup and coordinates well with the ZCB in protection. In Fig. 14-c, this is a case with a fault current beyond the maximum tolerable fault current defined in the coordination method. The ZCB is triggered immediately after the fault occurs followed by the fuse activated by the accumulated melting energy internally. In scenario #3, there is no coordination reached between ZCB and fuse, which meets the prerequisite condition of the proposed coordination method.\n(a) Rf = 10 \u2126, Tchanging = 103 \u00b5s\n(b) Rf = 10 \u2126, Tchanging = 104 \u00b5s\nFurther, a few sets of simulation tests were performed by changing the fault resistance within [2.5 \u2126, 40 \u2126] and the fault changing time within [5 \u00b5s, 200 \u00b5s]. The test results generated Fig. 15 to present the coordination relationships between ZCB and fuse under various fault circumstances. It is noticed that there is a coordination zone introduced from the coordination method. The coordination zone is clearly divided into two subregions: \u201cZCB Only\u201d (i.e., scenario #1), and \u201cFuse Only\u201d (i.e., scenario #2). There is no interference between ZCB and fuse operations. Regarding the region beyond the peak tolerable fault current, there is a sub-region of \u201cBoth Tripped\u201d (i.e., scenario #3) between the green solid line and the red dashed line. But, since the current exceeds the peak tolerable fault current, this sub-region is not in the scope of neither the coordination method nor the fault protection consideration. Overall, it is proven that the coordination method can effectively realize the coordinated operation between ZCB and fuse under the peak tolerable fault current.\nFIGURE 15.

The 1st constraint takes care of the fault changing time, while the 2nd constraint considering the influence of ZCB\u2019s current cutoff process on the possible tripping of the fuse. Based on the identified constraints and formulated thresholds, a five-step procedure of the proposed coordination method is developed in this article. A simulation testbed of dc system protection is built up based on the modeling circuits of ZCB and fuse to verify the effectiveness of the proposed coordination method. A few sets of simulation tests are performed with various fault currents and fault changing time. It is proven that, by following the proposed coordination method, the fuse coordinates well to the ZCB as backup protection under the designated peak tolerable fault current.\nTherefore, the developed coordination method can be valid to specify fuse to compensate ZCB\u2019s functionality and thus introduce a complete \u201cthermal-magnetic\u201d function of a hybrid ZCB-fuse circuit breaker. The hybrid ZCB-fuse circuit breaker is applicable to dc protection of the distributed energy resources defined in the IEEE Std. 1547-2018, as well as the HVDC transmission and MVDC distribution dc networks. It promotes the penetration rate of distributed systems (such as the photovoltaic systems and the electric vehicle systems) in the utility grid. Overall, this research work helps to increase the reliability of short-circuit protection with ZCBs in modern dc power systems."
