 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading the paper:

1. Develop new techniques to extract more fine-grained features from the skeletal data to better represent the nuances of tennis actions. The paper currently uses distances between joints, but more complex features could be engineered.

2. Explore different graph neural network architectures beyond ST-GCN to model the spatial and temporal relationships in the skeletal data. New architectures may be able to learn richer representations.

3. Collect and annotate a large-scale tennis action dataset to facilitate training and evaluation of more complex models. The models are currently evaluated on generic action datasets.

4. Incorporate computer vision techniques by fusing RGB video data with the skeletal data to take advantage of multiple modalities. The paper currently only uses skeletal data.

5. Build an end-to-end system that can take raw video as input and provide real-time feedback to tennis players on their actions. This could be a useful training aid.
