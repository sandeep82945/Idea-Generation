    "abstractText": "An effective method to improve neural machine translation with monolingual data is to augment the parallel training corpus with back-translations of target language sentences. This work broadens the understanding of back-translation and investigates a number of methods to generate synthetic source sentences. We find that in all but resource poor settings back-translations obtained via sampling or noised beam outputs are most effective. Our analysis shows that sampling or noisy synthetic data gives a much stronger training signal than data generated by beam or greedy search. We also compare how synthetic data compares to genuine bitext and study various domain effects. Finally, we scale to hundreds of millions of monolingual sentences and achieve a new state of the art of 35 BLEU on the WMT\u201914 English-German test set.",

However, bitext is limited and there is a much larger amount of monolingual data available. Monolingual data has been traditionally used to train language models which improved the fluency of statistical machine translation (Koehn, 2010).\nIn the context of neural machine translation (NMT; Bahdanau et al. 2015; Gehring et al. 2017; Vaswani et al. 2017), there has been extensive work to improve models with monolingual data, including language model fusion (Gulcehre et al., 2015, 2017), back-translation (Sennrich et al., 2016a) and dual learning (Cheng et al., 2016; He et al., 2016a). These methods have different advantages and can be combined to reach high accuracy (Hassan et al., 2018).\n*Work done while at Facebook AI Research.\nWe focus on back-translation (BT) which operates in a semi-supervised setup where both bilingual and monolingual data in the target language are available. Back-translation first trains an intermediate system on the parallel data which is used to translate the target monolingual data into the source language. The result is a parallel corpus where the source side is synthetic machine translation output while the target is genuine text written by humans. The synthetic parallel corpus is then simply added to the real bitext in order to train a final system that will translate from the source to the target language. Although simple, this method has been shown to be helpful for phrase-based translation (Bojar and Tamchyna, 2011), NMT (Sennrich et al., 2016a; Poncelas et al., 2018) as well as unsupervised MT (Lample et al., 2018a).\nIn this paper, we investigate back-translation for neural machine translation at a large scale by adding hundreds of millions of back-translated sentences to the bitext. Our experiments are based on strong baseline models trained on the public bitext of the WMT competition. We extend previous analysis (Sennrich et al., 2016a; Poncelas et al., 2018) of back-translation in several ways. We provide a comprehensive analysis of different methods to generate synthetic source sentences and we show that this choice matters: sampling from the model distribution or noising beam outputs outperforms pure beam search, which is typically used, by 1.7 BLEU on average across several test sets. Our analysis shows that synthetic data based on sampling and noised beam search provides a stronger training signal than synthetic data based on argmax inference. We also study how adding synthetic data compares to adding real bitext in a controlled setup with the surprising finding that synthetic data can sometimes match the accuracy of real bitext. Our best setup achieves 35 BLEU on the WMT\u201914 English-German test set by rely-\ning only on public WMT bitext as well as 226M monolingual sentences. This outperforms the system of DeepL by 1.7 BLEU who train on large amounts of high quality non-benchmark data. On WMT\u201914 English-French we achieve 45.6 BLEU."

            "text": "We build upon recent work on neural machine translation which is typically a neural network with an encoder/decoder architecture. The encoder infers a continuous space representation of the source sentence, while the decoder is a neural language model conditioned on the encoder output. The parameters of both models are learned jointly to maximize the likelihood of the target sentences given the corresponding source sentences from a parallel corpus (Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014). At inference, a target sentence is generated by left-to-right decoding.\nDifferent neural architectures have been proposed with the goal of improving efficiency and/or effectiveness. This includes recurrent networks (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015), convolutional networks (Kalchbrenner et al., 2016; Gehring et al., 2017; Kaiser et al., 2017) and transformer networks (Vaswani et al., 2017). Recent work relies on attention mechanisms where the encoder produces a sequence of vectors and, for each target token, the decoder attends to the most relevant part of the source through a contextdependent weighted-sum of the encoder vectors (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Attention has been refined with multi-hop attention (Gehring et al., 2017), self-attention (Vaswani et al., 2017; Paulus et al., 2018) and multi-head attention (Vaswani et al., 2017). We use a transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017)."

            "text": "Monolingual target data has been used to improve the fluency of machine translations since the early IBM models (Brown et al., 1990). In phrase-based systems, language models (LM) in the target language increase the score of fluent outputs during decoding (Koehn et al., 2003; Brants et al., 2007).\nA similar strategy can be applied to NMT (He et al., 2016b). Besides improving accuracy during decoding, neural LM and NMT can benefit from deeper integration, e.g. by combining the hidden states of both models (Gulcehre et al., 2017). Neural architecture also allows multi-task learning and parameter sharing between MT and target-side LM (Domhan and Hieber, 2017).\nBack-translation (BT) is an alternative to leverage monolingual data. BT is simple and easy to apply as it does not require modification to the MT training algorithms. It requires training a targetto-source system in order to generate additional synthetic parallel data from the monolingual target data. This data complements human bitext to train the desired source-to-target system. BT has been applied earlier to phrase-base systems (Bojar and Tamchyna, 2011). For these systems, BT has also been successful in leveraging monolingual data for domain adaptation (Bertoldi and Federico, 2009; Lambert et al., 2011). Recently, BT has been shown beneficial for NMT (Sennrich et al., 2016a; Poncelas et al., 2018). It has been found to be particularly useful when parallel data is scarce (Karakanta et al., 2017).\nCurrey et al. (2017) show that low resource language pairs can also be improved with synthetic data where the source is simply a copy of the monolingual target data. Concurrently to our work, Imamura et al. (2018) show that sampling synthetic sources is more effective than beam search. Specifically, they sample multiple sources for each target whereas we draw only a single sample, opting to train on a larger number of target sentences instead. Hoang et al. (2018) and Cotterell and Kreutzer (2018) suggest an iterative procedure which continuously improves the quality of the back-translation and final systems. Niu et al. (2018) experiment with a multilingual model that does both the forward and backward translation which is continuously trained with new synthetic data.\nThere has also been work using source-side monolingual data (Zhang and Zong, 2016). Furthermore, Cheng et al. (2016); He et al. (2016a); Xia et al. (2017) show how monolingual text from both languages can be leveraged by extending back-translation to dual learning: when training both source-to-target and target-to-source models jointly, one can use back-translation in both directions and perform multiple rounds of BT. A simi-\nlar idea is applied in unsupervised NMT (Lample et al., 2018a,b). Besides monolingual data, various approaches have been introduced to benefit from parallel data in other language pairs (Johnson et al., 2017; Firat et al., 2016a,b; Ha et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2018).\nData augmentation is an established technique in computer vision where a labeled dataset is supplemented with cropped or rotated input images. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been successfully used to the same end (Antoniou et al., 2017; Perez and Wang, 2017) as well as models that learn distributions over image transformations (Hauberg et al., 2016)."

            "text": "Back-translation typically uses beam search (Sennrich et al., 2016a) or just greedy search (Lample et al., 2018a,b) to generate synthetic source sentences. Both are approximate algorithms to identify the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) output, i.e. the sentence with the largest estimated probability given an input. Beam is generally successful in finding high probability outputs (Ott et al., 2018a).\nHowever, MAP prediction can lead to less rich translations (Ott et al., 2018a) since it always favors the most likely alternative in case of ambiguity. This is particularly problematic in tasks where there is a high level of uncertainty such as dialog (Serban et al., 2016) and story generation (Fan et al., 2018). We argue that this is also problematic for a data augmentation scheme such as backtranslation. Beam and greedy focus on the head of the model distribution which results in very regular synthetic source sentences that do not properly cover the true data distribution.\nAs alternative, we consider sampling from the model distribution as well as adding noise to beam search outputs. First, we explore unrestricted sampling which generates outputs that are very diverse but sometimes highly unlikely. Second, we investigate sampling restricted to the most likely words (Graves, 2013; Ott et al., 2018a; Fan et al., 2018). At each time step, we select the k most likely tokens from the output distribution, renormalize and then sample from this restricted set. This is a middle ground between MAP and unrestricted sampling.\nAs a third alternative, we apply noising Lample et al. (2018a) to beam search outputs. Adding noise to input sentences has been very benefi-\ncial for the autoencoder setups of (Lample et al., 2018a; Hill et al., 2016) which is inspired by denoising autoencoders (Vincent et al., 2008). In particular, we transform source sentences with three types of noise: deleting words with probability 0.1, replacing words by a filler token with probability 0.1, and swapping words which is implemented as a random permutation over the tokens, drawn from the uniform distribution but restricted to swapping words no further than three positions apart."

We consider two types of MAP prediction: greedy search (greedy) and beam search with beam size 5 (beam). Non-MAP methods include unrestricted sampling from the model distribution (sampling), restricting sampling to the k highest scoring outputs at every time step with k = 10 (top10) as well as adding noise to the beam outputs (beam+noise). Restricted sampling is a middle-ground between\nbeam search and unrestricted sampling, it is less likely to pick very low scoring outputs but still preserves some randomness. Preliminary experiments with top5, top20, top50 gave similar results to top10.\nWe also vary the amount of synthetic data and perform 30K updates during training for the bitext only, 50K updates when adding 3M synthetic sentences, 75K updates for 6M and 12M sentences and 100K updates for 24M sentences. For each setting, this corresponds to enough updates to reach convergence in terms of held-out loss. In our 128 GPU setup, training of the final models takes 3h 20min for the bitext only model, 7h 30min for 6M and 12M synthetic sentences, and 10h 15min for 24M sentences. During training we also sample the bitext more frequently than the synthetic data and we analyze the effect of this in more detail in \u00a75.5.\nFigure 1 shows that sampling and beam+noise outperform the MAP methods (pure beam search and greedy) by 0.8-1.1 BLEU. Sampling and beam+noise improve over bitext-only (5M) by between 1.7-2 BLEU in the largest data setting. Restricted sampling (top10) performs better than beam and greedy but is not as effective as unrestricted sampling (sampling) or beam+noise.\nTable 1 shows results on a wider range of\ntest sets (newstest2013-2017). Sampling and beam+noise perform roughly equal and we adopt sampling for the remaining experiments."

            "text": "The previous experiment showed that synthetic source sentences generated via sampling and beam with noise perform significantly better than those obtained by pure MAP methods. Why is this?\nBeam search focuses on very likely outputs which reduces the diversity and richness of the generated source translations. Adding noise to beam outputs and sampling do not have this problem: Noisy source sentences make it harder to predict the target translations which may help learning, similar to denoising autoencoders (Vincent et al., 2008). Sampling is known to better approximate the data distribution which is richer than the argmax model outputs (Ott et al., 2018a). There-\nfore, sampling is also more likely to provide a richer training signal than argmax sequences.\nTo get a better sense of the training signal provided by each method, we compare the loss on the training data for each method. We report the cross entropy loss averaged over all tokens and separate the loss over the synthetic data and the real bitext data. Specifically, we choose the setup with 24M synthetic sentences. At the end of each epoch we measure the loss over 500K sentence pairs sub-sampled from the synthetic data as well as an equally sized subset of the bitext. For each generation method we choose the same sentences except for the bitext which is disjoint from the synthetic data. This means that losses over the synthetic data are measured over the same target tokens because the generation methods only differ in the source sentences. We found it helpful to upsample the frequency with which we observe the bitext compared to the synthetic data (\u00a75.5) but we do not upsample for this experiment to keep conditions as similar as possible. We assume that when the training loss is low, then the model can easily fit the training data without extracting much learning signal compared to data which is harder to fit.\nFigure 2 shows that synthetic data based on\ngreedy or beam is much easier to fit compared to data from sampling, top10, beam+noise and the bitext. In fact, the perplexity on beam data falls below 2 after only 5 epochs. Except for sampling, we find that the perplexity on the training data is somewhat correlated to the end-model accuracy (cf. Figure 1) and that all methods except sampling have a lower loss than real bitext.\nThese results suggest that synthetic data obtained with argmax inference does not provide as rich a training signal as sampling or adding noise. We conjecture that the regularity of synthetic data obtained with argmax inference is not optimal. Sampling and noised argmax both expose the model to a wider range of source sentences which makes the model more robust to reordering and substitutions that happen naturally, even if the model of reordering and substitution through noising is not very realistic.\nNext we analyze the richness of synthetic outputs and train a language model on real human text and score synthetic source sentences generated by beam search, sampling, top10 and beam+noise. We hypothesize that data that is very regular should be more predictable by the language model and therefore receive low perplexity. We eliminate a possible domain mismatch effect between the language model training data and the synthetic data by splitting the parallel corpus into three nonoverlapping parts:\n1. On 640K sentences pairs, we train a backtranslation model,\n2. On 4.1M sentence pairs, we take the source side and train a 5-gram Kneser-Ney language model (Heafield et al., 2013),\n3. On the remaining 450K sentences, we apply the back-translation system using beam, sampling and top10 generation.\nFor the last set, we have genuine source sentences as well as synthetic sources from different generation techniques. We report the perplexity of our language model on all versions of the source data in Table 2. The results show that beam outputs receive higher probability by the language model compared to sampling, beam+noise and real source sentences. This indicates that beam search outputs are not as rich as sampling outputs or beam+noise. This lack of variability probably explains in part why back-translations from pure beam search provide a weaker training signal than alternatives.\nCloser inspection of the synthetic sources (Table 3) reveals that sampled and noised beam outputs are sometimes not very adequate, much more so than MAP outputs, e.g., sampling often introduces target words which have no counterpart in the source. This happens because sampling sometimes picks highly unlikely outputs which are harder to fit (cf. Figure 2)."

            "text": "The experiments so far are based on a setup with a large bilingual corpus. However, in resource poor settings the back-translation model is of much lower quality. Are non-MAP methods still more effective in such a setup? To answer this question, we simulate such setups by sub-sampling the training data to either 80K sentence-pairs or 640K sentence-pairs and then add synthetic data from sampling and beam search. We compare these smaller setups to our original 5.2M sentence bitext configuration. The accuracy of the\nGerman-English back-translation systems steadily increases with more training data: On newstest2012 we measure 13.5 BLEU for 80K bitext, 24.3 BLEU for 640K and 28.3 BLEU for 5M.\nFigure 3 shows that sampling is more effective than beam for larger setups (640K and 5.2M bitexts) while the opposite is true for resource poor settings (80K bitext). This is likely because the back-translations in the 80K setup are of very poor quality and the noise of sampling and beam+noise is too detrimental for this brittle low-resource setting. When the setup is very small the very regular MAP outputs still provide useful training signal while the noise from sampling becomes harmful."

            "text": "Next, we turn to two different questions: How does real human bitext compare to synthetic data in terms of final model accuracy? And how does the domain of the monolingual data affect results?\nTo answer these questions, we subsample 640K sentence-pairs of the bitext and train a backtranslation system on this set. To train a forward model, we consider three alternative types of data to add to this 640K training set. We either add:\n\u2022 the remaining parallel data (bitext),\n\u2022 the back-translated target side of the remaining parallel data (BT-bitext),\n\u2022 back-translated newscrawl data (BT-news).\nThe back-translated data is generated via sampling. This setup allows us to compare synthetic data to genuine data since BT-bitext and bitext share the same target side. It also allows us to estimate the value of BT data for domain adaptation since the newscrawl corpus (BT-news) is pure news whereas the bitext is a mixture of europarl and commoncrawl with only a small newscommentary portion. To assess domain adaptation effects, we measure accuracy on two held-out sets:\n\u2022 newstest2012, i.e. pure newswire data.\n\u2022 a held-out set of the WMT training data (valid-mixed), which is a mixture of europarl, commoncrawl and the small newscommentary portion.\nFigure 4 shows the results on both validation sets. Most strikingly, BT-news performs almost as well as bitext on newstest2012 (Figure 4a) and improves the baseline (640K) by 2.6 BLEU. BTbitext improves by 2.2 BLEU, achieving 83% of the improvement with real bitext. This shows that synthetic data can be nearly as effective as real human translated data when the domains match.\nFigure 4b shows the accuracy on valid-mixed, the mixed domain valid set. The accuracy of BTnews is not as good as before since the domain of the BT data and the test set do not match. However, BT-news still improves the baseline by up to 1.2 BLEU. On the other hand, BT-bitext matches the domain of valid-mixed and improves by 2.7 BLEU. This trails the real bitext by only 1.3 BLEU and corresponds to 67% of the gain achieved with real human bitext.\nIn summary, synthetic data performs remarkably well, coming close to the improvements achieved with real bitext for newswire test data, or trailing real bitext by only 1.3 BLEU for validmixed. In absence of a large parallel corpus for news, back-translation therefore offers a simple, yet very effective domain adaptation technique."

            "text": "We found it beneficial to adjust the ratio of bitext to synthetic data observed during training. In particular, we tuned the rate at which we sample data from the bitext compared to synthetic data. For example, in a setup of 5M bitext sentences and 10M synthetic sentences, an upsampling rate of 2 means that we double the frequency at which we\nvisit bitext, i.e. training batches contain on average an equal amount of bitext and synthetic data as opposed to 1/3 bitext and 2/3 synthetic data.\nFigure 5 shows the accuracy of various upsampling rates for different generation methods in a setup with 5M bitext sentences and 24M synthetic sentences. Beam and greedy benefit a lot from higher rates which results in training more on the bitext data. This is likely because synthetic beam and greedy data does not provide as much training signal as the bitext which has more variation and is harder to fit. On the other hand, sampling and beam+noise require no upsampling of the bitext, which is likely because the synthetic data is already hard enough to fit and thus provides a strong training signal (\u00a75.2)."

Generating synthetic sources by sampling or by adding noise to beam outputs leads to higher accuracy than argmax inference which is typically used. In particular, sampling and noised beam outperforms pure beam by 1.7 BLEU on average on newstest2013-2017 for WMT English-German translation. Both methods provide a richer training signal for all but resource poor setups. We also find that synthetic data can achieve up to 83% of the performance attainable with real bitext. Finally, we achieve a new state of the art result of 35 BLEU on the WMT\u201914 English-German test set by using publicly available benchmark data only.\nIn future work, we would like to investigate an end-to-end approach where the back-translation model is optimized to output synthetic sources that are most helpful to the final forward model.\n4https://www.deepl.com/press.html"
