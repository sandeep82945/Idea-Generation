    "abstractText": "Analytical techniques used for estimating thermoelastic damping by incorporating both mechanical and thermal interactions between surfaces and the rest of the bulk are intricate and challenging due to the limited understanding of the damping mechanisms in extra-thin films subjected to forced vibrations. This paper proposes a modified model to analytically calculate the thermoelastic damping of ultrathin elastic films due to surface effects and analyzes the thermoelastic damping variation with different factors through numerical experiments on two materials. The model considers surface stresses derived from the elastic surface theory using Kirchhoff\u2019s kinetic hypothesis and determines thermoelastic damping by considering thermal dissipation and elastic potential energy. The results show that surface effects significantly influence the thermoelastic damping of the film, and the specific behavior of a thin film\u2019s thermoelastic damping with respect to film thickness is impacted by various factors, including material property, the variation range of film thickness, and the forced vibration frequency. This study provides insights into the thermoelastic damping behavior of thin films and has important implications for the development of nanoscale oscillators in MEMS or NEMS systems.",

            "text": "Analytical techniques used for estimating thermoelastic damping by incorporating both mechanical and thermal interactions between surfaces and the rest of the bulk are intricate and challenging due to the limited understanding of the damping mechanisms in extra-thin films subjected to forced vibrations. This paper proposes a modified model to analytically calculate the thermoelastic damping of ultrathin elastic films due to surface effects and analyzes the thermoelastic damping variation with different factors through numerical experiments on two materials. The model considers surface stresses derived from the elastic surface theory using Kirchhoff\u2019s kinetic hypothesis and determines thermoelastic damping by considering thermal dissipation and elastic potential energy. The results show that surface effects significantly influence the thermoelastic damping of the film, and the specific behavior of a thin film\u2019s thermoelastic damping with respect to film thickness is impacted by various factors, including material property, the variation range of film thickness, and the forced vibration frequency. This study provides insights into the thermoelastic damping behavior of thin films and has important implications for the development of nanoscale oscillators in MEMS or NEMS systems.\nMicroscale and nanoscale plates or shells serve as essential components in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS)1,2. Owing to their diminutive dimensions, these structures exhibit unique mechanical and thermal characteristics that deviate from their macroscopic counterparts. Comprehensive insights into the physical and mechanical behaviors of these microstructures and nanostructures are therefore indispensable and have garnered significant attention in the research community3\u20137.\nThe surfaces, as well as regions adjacent to the surfaces of solid films, are characterized by a minuscule thickness where atomic arrangements differ from the bulk material. Consequently, surface effects play a pivotal role in modulating the mechanical properties of the film, especially when the surface-to-volume ratio becomes increasingly significant8\u201313. Both experimental investigations and atomic-level simulations have confirmed that the surface structure and properties, such as surface stiffness, differ substantially from those in the bulk material14\u201316. Gurtin and Murdoch rigorously developed a general model that accounts for surface elasticity by conceptualizing the surfaces as two-dimensional membranes with distinct properties from the bulk material, adhering to the latter without any slippage17\u201319. Building upon the Gurtin\u2013Murdoch surface elasticity model, Huang et\u00a0al.20 formulated an analytical framework that incorporates the effects of curvature and classical inertia to study the nonlinear vibrations of simply supported thin films. The frequency of the film, rendered dimensionless for comparison, was computed and revealed significant deviations due to surface effects. Moreover, subsequent research has established that the mechanical and nonlinear vibrational properties of nanoscale thin films are intrinsically tied to their geometric features, particularly the size of the film, in numerous MEMS and NEMS applications20\u201325.\nOne noteworthy phenomenon is the generation of strain-induced heat in film-like oscillators undergoing high-frequency vibrations due to resonant forces, a manifestation of the well-understood thermoelastic effect. This results in a thermal gradient across the film, leading to a decrease in temperature in tensioned regions and an increase in temperature in compressed regions. Such heat transfer within the structure can induce thermoelastic damping, which in turn can attenuate the vibrational motion of the oscillator26. Recognizing thermoelastic damping as a critical attribute, engineers and researchers have emphasized its role in the structural design of various electromechanical and nanomechanical systems27\u201330. However, a comprehensive analytical approach\nOPEN\nCollege of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Jiaxing University, Jiaxing 314001, Zhejiang, China. *email: dwhuang@ustc.edu.cn\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:19658 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-46826-1\nthat integrates both mechanical and thermal interactions between surface and bulk regions for thermoelastic damping prediction is lacking. Existing studies on damping mechanisms primarily rely on empirical or semiempirical methodologies. Furthermore, the influence of variables such as film size, material properties31, and forced vibration frequency on thermoelastic damping, especially in the context of surface effects, remains inadequately understood.\nThis study aims to formulate an analytical model to quantify thermoelastic damping in strip films, taking into account the impact of surface effects. The model employs surface stress equations based on elastic surface theory, using Kirchhoff \u2019s kinetic hypothesis as the foundational principle. Thermoelastic damping is then evaluated through the calculation of thermal dissipation and peak elastic potential energy. The insights gained from understanding thermoelastic damping will contribute to the informed and optimized design of thin film components in MEMS and NEMS systems."

Kirchhoff \u2019s modified plate theory serves as a mathematical model that elucidates the behavior of thin plates under mechanical loads. Concurrently, a thermoelastic damping model was developed, accounting for surface effects. This model is predicated on the ratio of energy dissipation to the maximum elastic energy within one oscillation cycle. Subsequent to establishing this thermoelastic damping model, a parameter analysis was conducted to deeply understand the impact of surface effects on thermoelastic damping.\nGoverning equations for the transverse linear steady-state vibration of elastic film Consider a rectangular strip film with a constant thickness h and dimensions L \u00d7 \u221e along the x-axis and y-axis.

            "text": "During the linear steady-state vibration of a simply supported film subjected to resonant forces Pei\u03c9t , the film vibrates at its natural frequency, leading to alternate compression and tension in different parts of the film. This mechanical energy, during these vibrations, is partially transformed into thermal energy due to frictional forces and inherent material damping. Compressed regions generate heat from frictional forces and material deformation, resulting in a temperature rise. While tensioned regions store energy with minimal heat generation, causing a temperature decrease. Consequently, a temperature gradient is established within the film, inducing heat transfer.\nIn micro or nanomechanical systems, where the elastic film acts as a high-frequency resonator, the vibrations of such thin films can be viewed as an adiabatic process. This is because the high vibration frequencies typically prevent rapid heat exchange with the surrounding environment. Without considering an internal heat source, the heat conduction equation within the film can be derived using the minimum energy principle applied to temperature changes and subsequent integration. It is expressed as:\nwhere \u03b8 indicates the temperature change, T0 is the initial temperature, e = \u03b5ii , \u03ba = k\u03c1ce represents the thermal diffusion coefficient, k denotes thermal conductivity, \u03c1 is the material density, and ce stands for the specific heat capacity.\nGiven the absence of an internal heat source in the film, heat generation can solely arise from the work exerted by external forces. By adhering to Kirchhoff \u2019s assumption, the positive strain effect in the thickness direction is disregarded, leading to the condition: \u03b5zz = 0 . In the context of thin film vibration incited by external resonant forces, strain-induced heat arising from these forces is the primary cause of the temperature gradient. When addressing heat transfer within the film, it can be assumed that the temperature fluctuation along the film\u2019s thickness greatly surpasses any in-plane changes. Hence, in the heat conduction equation, the mid-plane\u2019s temperature deviation can be disregarded to streamline computations.

This is primarily due to the simply supported boundary conditions along the film\u2019s edges. Therefore, in-plane displacements are insignificant and can be overlooked.\nSince the elastic film, as an oscillator in the microelectromechanical system, vibrates at a high frequency and exchanges heat with the surrounding environment very slowly, the thermal boundary condition of the film can be approximated to an adiabatic process.

These cover two distinct cases involving the linear steady-state vibration of elastic films under the action of resonant forces. A thorough parameter analysis was carried out to understand the influence of essential parameters on thermoelastic damping. These parameters include attributes such as film thickness, the ratio of film width to thickness, material constants, and the frequency of the forced vibration. Additionally, for a comparative viewpoint, our findings from each case were contrasted with the results from the linear steady-state vibration of elastic films subjected to resonant forces without considering any surface effects. Additionally, to provide a comparative perspective, our findings from each scenario are juxtaposed against the outcomes derived from the linear steady-state vibration of elastic films subjected to resonant forces but in the absence of any surface effects.

The details of materials are as follows:\nSet I a glass substrate coated with 100\u00a0nm thick layer of iron (Material I)\nSet II a freshly cleaved surface with no additional coating (Material II)\nThe two materials exhibit different surface material constants, with the second material having a significantly smaller and negative intrinsic length scale l (e.g., \u22122.651\u00d7 10\u221211 ) than the first ( 4.069\u00d7 10\u22127).\nThermoelastic damping with surface effect Results using Eq.\u00a0(30) indicate that for both materials, notable surface effects emerge at varying thickness values.

For both Material I and II, when surface effects are disregarded, the constant thermoelastic damping values are 9.17 \u00d7 10\u22126\u00a0m and 2.81 \u00d7 10\u22126\u00a0m respectively. When considering surface effects for Material I, the peak thermoelastic damping reaches 10.14 \u00d7 10\u22126\u00a0m. This value decreases as thickness grows, ultimately stabilizing at 9.47 \u00d7 10\u22126\u00a0m at s = 10. In contrast, for Material II, the thermoelastic damping exhibits a slight growth with an increase in thickness, rising from 2.806 \u00d7 10\u22126\u00a0m to 2.808 \u00d7 10\u22126\u00a0m at s = 10. The maximum value for thermoelastic damping is remarkably similar to the value achieved without surface effect.\nAs a material\u2019s size reduces, surface effects become increasingly pronounced, especially as the ratio of surface area to bulk volume rises. At nanoscales, a material\u2019s surface area can significantly dictate its bulk properties. Surface material constants define a material\u2019s surface attributes, which may differ from its inherent bulk properties. Addressing these surface material constants becomes vital when examining thin films or nanostructures due to their potential significant impact on the material\u2019s attributes and performance. There exists a notable difference between the material constants of Material I and Material II. Figures\u00a02 and 3 further highlight that Material I exhibit a considerably greater thermoelastic damping than Material II, regardless of the presence or absence of surface effects. To illustrate, without considering surface effects, the thermoelastic damping of Material I is 9.17 \u00d7 10\u22126\u00a0m, which is approximately 3.3 times greater than that of Material II when s = 10.\nImpact of width-to-thickness ratio and film thickness The significance of the surface effect in strip films become evident when the thickness of these films reduces to the nanometer scale. To explore the influence of thickness on the surface effect, we maintained a constant widthto-thickness ratio s, for both Material I and Material II. Two specific width-to-thickness ratios were assessed, namely s = 10 and s = 20, at dimensionless resonant force frequencies of 105 and 104. We present the relationship between thermoelastic damping and film thickness (for both Material I and Material II) at the resonant force 104 as both dimensionless frequencies reveal similar data trends.\nFigure\u00a02 illustrates that when the surface effect is excluded, the consistent thermoelastic damping value for a thin film with s = 10 is 9.168 \u00d7 10\u22126\u00a0m. This is 27% greater than that of the film with s = 20. This observation suggests that a film with a smaller width (relative to its thickness) tends to exhibit a higher thermoelastic damping when the thickness remains unchanged. Incorporating the surface effects into the analysis, specifically through Eq.\u00a0(30), and accounting for surface material constants of Material I (i.e., \u03c40 , 0 and \u00b50 ), reveals that the narrower film still displays higher thermoelastic damping compared to its wider counterpart. Moreover, thermoelastic damping for both films decrease exponentially with increasing thickness. As an instance, for the Material I film with s = 20, thermoelastic damping values reduce by 1.63%, from 7.361 \u00d7 10\u22126\u00a0m to 7.241 \u00d7 10\u22126\u00a0m as thickness escalates from 10\u22129\u00a0m to 10\u22126\u00a0m. Meanwhile, for the narrower film with s = 10, thermoelastic damping values decrease by 6.54%, from 10.136 \u00d7 10\u22126\u00a0m to 9.473 \u00d7 10\u22126\u00a0m. Similar findings are also noted for Material II, as depicted in Fig.\u00a03. Specifically, thermoelastic damping values rise by 13.04% and 0.06% for s = 20 and s = 10.\nThermoelastic damping with the impact of dimensionless frequency Figure\u00a04 illustrates the behavior of Material II under the influence of surface effects for width-to-thickness ratios s = 20 and s = 10. Notably, as the film thickness increases, thermoelastic damping also rises regardless of the vibration frequency. However, the vibration frequency plays a significant role in this increase. Specifically, a higher vibration frequency leads to a more pronounced change in thermoelastic damping due to the surface effect, especially in the thickness range of 10\u22129 to 10\u22123\u00a0mm. In contrast, the behavior of Material I, as depicted in Fig.\u00a05, is different. For width-to-thickness ratios s = 20 or s = 10, the variations in thermoelastic damping, when influenced by surface effects, are less pronounced at higher frequencies.\nFigure\u00a03.

Our analytical findings highlight the profound influence of surface effects on thermoelastic damping. Notably, with surface effects taken into account, thermoelastic damping undergoes notable variations with the increase in film thickness for both Material I and Material II. In contrast, employing the classical continuum theory and classical thermoelectricity theory without considering the surface effect yields a consistent thermoelastic damping value.\nThe emergence of surface effects in thin films under periodic vibrations has been extensively documented and clarified by numerous studies20,37,38.

High-frequency vibrations induce temperature fluctuations, with compressioninduced temperature rises in sections of the film, while tensioned sections witness temperature reductions. This temperature disparity creates an uneven stress field during vibrations, manifesting as thermoelastic damping (as depicted in Fig.\u00a02), which becomes a primary avenue for energy loss.\nContrasting the thermoelastic damping variations (as illustrated in Figs.\u00a02a and 3a) between Material I and II indicates that Material II\u2019s thermoelastic damping demonstrates exhibits less sensitivity to thickness changes under similar frequency conditions and a length-to-thickness ratio of 10 (6.54% vs. 0.06%). This diminished sensitivity in Material II can likely be linked to its considerably smaller intrinsic length scale l and summation terms (the key component of the denominator term in Eq.\u00a030 for calculating thermoelastic damping. In the thermoelastic damping formula (Eq.\u00a030), the intrinsic length scale l = (2\u00b50 \u2212 \u03c40 + 0)/E pertains solely to the material\u2019s surface parameters. Given that the material constants of Material II are markedly smaller than those of Material I, as the thickness escalates from 10\u22129 to 10\u22123\u00a0m, the summation term for both materials, specifically\n1 24(1\u2212v2) + 1 4 l h , undergoes variations. For Material I, this figure drops sharply from 101.778 to 0.045, whereas for Material II, there\u2019s a minor increase from 0.038 to 0.045 (as seen in Fig.\u00a06). Such outcomes reveal that, when surface material properties are predominant, Material II showcases reduced sensitivity to thickness alterations concerning its thermoelastic damping behavior.\nHowever, for thinner films (namely, s = 20), the behavior alters: Material II demonstrates increased sensitivity to thickness variations in comparison to Material I, with values of 13.04% against 1.63%. This finding illustrates that the behavior of thermoelastic damping in relation to film thickness might depend on multiple elements, including the material composition and the range of thickness variation. This is supported by the fact that the material properties and width-to-thickness ratio play critical roles in the denominator and numerator of Eq.\u00a0(30), respectively, which is utilized for calculating thermoelastic damping39,40.\nThe strikingly divergent trends in thermoelastic damping observed between Materials I and II can be partially attributed to their distinct surface constants. Material II possesses considerably smaller material constants in contrast to Material I. Notably, Material II\u2019s \u03bb0 even presents a negative value. This leads to contrasting variation patterns in the intrinsic length scale concerning the film thickness for Materials I and II, as depicted in Fig.\u00a06.\nOur previous research20 revealed that the dimensionless intrinsic frequency of forcibly vibrated ultra-thin films (covering both Material I and Material II) with simple support undergoes an increase with the reduction of film thickness due to surface effect. The present study extends this understanding, illustrating the role of the forced vibration frequency in influencing the thermoelastic damping trends relative to film thickness (as presented in Figs.\u00a04 and 5). As previously highlighted, multiple factors, including material property and the range of thickness variation, influence a thin film\u2019s thermoelastic damping behavior concerning its thickness. Therefore, it\u2019s logical that the trends in thermoelastic damping variation with film thickness under different forced vibration frequencies display contrasting patterns: the shifts in thermoelastic damping relative to film thickness due to the surface effect are more pronounced at elevated forced vibration frequencies for Material II, but they are less for Material I.\nCurrently, there\u2019s growing interest in investigating nanofilms and nanoplates as potential oscillators in MEMS or NEMS systems41,42. However, when pondering the potential application of the formula developed in this paper, it\u2019s essential to recognize that the model presumes a homogenous, isotropic, and perfectly elastic body. Future inquiries can delve into thin films that exhibit non-uniformities in both thickness and composition.\nFigure\u00a06.

            "text": "In this study, we introduce a refined model to theoretically determine the thermoelastic damping of ultrathin elastic films with nanoscale thickness, considering the impact of the surface effect. Our approach hinges on numerical experiments using two distinct materials. The advanced model integrates surface stresses derived from elastic surface theory, rooted in the foundation of Kirchhoff \u2019s kinetic hypothesis. Thermoelastic damping resulting from both surface effects and periodic vibration is determined by examining thermal dissipation alongside the maximum elastic potential energy.\nOur derived explicit solution emphasizes the profound impact of surface effects on the film\u2019s thermoelastic damping. A comparative analysis between Material I and Material II unveils that Material II\u2019s thermoelastic damping exhibits reduced sensitivity to thickness alterations under similar conditions, namely frequency and a length-to-thickness ratio of 10. This is potentially due to Material II\u2019s smaller intrinsic length scale and summation terms. Nonetheless, thin film\u2019s thermoelastic damping behavior, in relation to its thickness, is also influenced by other factors, like the inherent material properties, the range of thickness variation, and the externally imposed vibration frequency.\nThe findings from this research offer valuable perspectives on the thermoelastic damping characteristics of thin films across various conditions. They hold significant relevance for advancing nanoscale oscillators in MEMS or NEMS systems. Future research directions could encompass the exploration of thin films characterized by irregularities in thickness and material composition."
