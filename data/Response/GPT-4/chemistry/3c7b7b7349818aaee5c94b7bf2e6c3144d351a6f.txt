Secoiridoid and Carotenoid Synergy Exploration: Investigate the potential synergistic effects between secoiridoids (such as oleacein and oleocanthal) and carotenoids in enhancing the oxidative stability and antioxidant capacity of EVOO. This could include exploring optimal ratios and conditions to maximize this synergy.

Impact of Olive Cultivar Variability: Expand the research to include different olive cultivars beyond ‘Corbella’ to assess the generalizability of the findings. This could help identify other cultivars with potential for producing stable EVOOs or uncover cultivar-specific conditions that optimize stability and shelf life.

Advanced Processing Techniques: Explore the application of advanced olive processing and storage techniques (e.g., modified atmosphere storage, use of specific temperature and humidity controls) to further enhance the content of beneficial compounds like oleacein, oleocanthal, and carotenoids, and their impact on the stability of EVOO.

Genetic and Biotechnological Approaches: Conduct genetic and biotechnological studies to understand the biosynthesis pathways of key compounds affecting EVOO stability. This could lead to breeding or engineering olive trees for higher production of these compounds, or developing biotechnological methods to enhance their levels in oil post-extraction.

Health Implications of Optimized EVOO: Examine the health benefits and nutritional implications of EVOO optimized for higher contents of oleacein, oleocanthal, and carotenoids. This research could include clinical trials to assess the impact of consumption of these optimized EVOOs on markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and chronic diseases.
