            "text": "Polariton Localization and Dispersion Properties of Disordered Quantum Emitters in Multimode Microcavities\nGeorg Engelhardt1,2,3 and Jianshu Cao4\u2217 1Shenzhen Institute for Quantum Science and Engineering,\nSouthern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, China 2International Quantum Academy, Shenzhen 518048, China\n3 Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Quantum Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, 518055, China.\n4Department of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA\n(Dated: June 1, 2023)\nExperiments have demonstrated that the strong light-matter coupling in polaritonic microcavities significantly enhances transport. Motivated by these experiments, we have solved the disordered multimode Tavis-Cummings model in the thermodynamic limit and used this solution to analyze its dispersion and localization properties. The solution implies that wave-vector-resolved spectroscopic quantities can be described by single-mode models, but spatially resolved quantities require the multimode solution. Nondiagonal elements of the Green\u2019s function decay exponentially with distance, which defines the coherence length. The coherence length is strongly correlated with the photon weight and exhibits inverse scaling with respect to the Rabi frequency and an unusual dependence on disorder. For energies away from the average molecular energy EM and above the confinement energy EC , the coherence length rapidly diverges such that it exceeds the photon resonance wavelength \u03bb0. The rapid divergence allows us to differentiate the localized and delocalized regimes and identify the transition from diffusive to ballistic transport.\nIntroduction.\u2014 The spatial confinement of the light field in microcavities gives rise to dispersive polaritons with outstanding spectroscopic properties [1] and establishes an alternative channel for charge and energy transport different from the short-range hopping. Recent experimental measurements of microcavities have found that transport can be enhanced by orders of magnitude [2\u20137]. A thorough description is challenging because of the large number of light modes in the cavity and the energetic, spatial and orientational disorder.\nMany theoretical models describe the light field by a single cavity mode, which is coupled to a macroscopic number of quantum emitters [8\u201327]. Recent investigations have predicted an intriguing turnover of the transport, relaxation and the linewidth as a function of disorder [8, 9]. However, due to the all-to-all coupling structure in single-mode models, excitons can travel instantaneously between distant emitters and thus exceed the speed of light, potentially leading to an unphysical prediction for the transport efficiency.\nSince the photonic dispersion relation ensures the speed of light, the light fields should be described as a continuum of cavity modes. For example, the impact of disorder on polaritons was investigated perturbatively [28\u201331]. Exact diagonalization and integration [32, 33], mean-field based approaches [34\u201337], Monte-Carlo methods [38] and density-functional theory [39] have been used to numerically investigate multimode models. Yet, a fully microscopic and analytical solution of the light-matter dynamics for disordered quantum emitters is still lack-\n\u2217 jianshu@mit.edu\ning. In this Letter, we analytically and numerically solve the multimode disordered Tavis-Cumming model nonperturbatively. Our closed-form solution predicts a finite coherence length for all polariton energies. Away from the average molecular energy EM, the coherence length rapidly diverges and exceeds by far the typical length of realistic microcavities. This defines two transport regimes in the energy spectrum: one regime of strongly localized polaritons, where transport is diffusive, and one regime of delocalized polaritons, where the large coherence length can support ballistic transport. The coherence length exhibits a turnover as a function of disorder, which has no analog in the Anderson localization [40\u201342], but is reminiscent of noise-assisted transport [43, 44]. Multimode disordered Tavis-Cummings model.\u2014 As shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), we consider a onedimensional microcavity of length L which contains N quantum emitters representing atoms, molecules, NV centers or particle-hole pairs in semiconductors. For concreteness, we focus on molecules in the following. We adopt a multimode disordered Tavis-Cummings model, whose Hamiltonian is given as H\u0302 = H\u0302M + H\u0302L + H\u0302LM, where\nH\u0302M = N\u2211 j=1 EjB\u0302 \u2020 j B\u0302j , H\u0302L = \u2211 k \u03c9ka\u0302 \u2020 ka\u0302k,\nH\u0302LM = N\u2211 j=1 \u2211 k gj,\u03baB\u0302 \u2020 j a\u0302k +H.c.

Overall parameters are L = 125\u00b5m, N = 5000, EM = 1 eV, \u03c3 = 0.05 eV, and g \u221a \u03c1 = 0.14 eV. The photonic cutoff energy is \u03c9cut-off = 50 eV, such that 5000 photonic modes are included in the simulations.\ning to a Gaussian function P (E) = 1\u221a \u03c0\u03c3 e\u2212(E\u2212EM) 2/(2\u03c32), with center EM and disorder width \u03c3. Yet, our findings also hold for arbitrary disorder distributions. The light field is quantized by the photonic operators a\u0302k labeled by k. The photonic dispersion relation is \u03c9k = \u221a c2q2k + E 2 C , where c is the speed of light, qk is the wave vector (specified below), and EC is the confinement energy depending on the geometry of the microcavity. As the total exci-\ntation number n\u0302 = \u2211\nj B\u0302 \u2020 j B\u0302j + \u2211 k a\u0302 \u2020 ka\u0302k is conserved,\nwe can restrict our analysis to the single-excitation manifold. The light-matter interaction in Eq. (1) is given by gj,k = gk\u03c6k(rj) where rj = jN/L is the position of molecule j, gk is the wave vector dependent light-matter interaction, and \u03c6k(r) are the photonic mode functions in one-dimensional space. We restrict the current investigation to energetic disorder, while spatial and orientational disorder will be considered elsewhere later.\nFor the numerical calculations we use an open boundary condition, such that the photonic modes are \u03c6k(r) = sin (qkr) / \u221a L/2 for the wave vectors qk = \u03c0k/L with integer k > 0 [45]. In the analytical calculation, we assume a periodic boundary condition such that the photonic modes are \u03c6k(r) = exp (iqkr) / \u221a L, where qk = 2\u03c0k/L with integer k. We note that in the L \u2192 \u221e limit, the boundary condition has a negligible effect.\nAnalytical solution. The Heisenberg equations of B\u0302j and a\u0302k are transformed into the Laplace space defined by f\u0302(z) = \u222b\u221e 0\ndte\u2212ztf\u0302(t) for arbitrary operators f\u0302(t). We find that the coupling between different cavity modes k1, k2 scales as a\u0302k1(z) \u221d \u03c1N\u22121/2a\u0302k2(z) and thus vanishes in the thermodynamic limit N,L \u2192 \u221e with con-\nstant density \u03c1 = N/L [45]. In other words, one can treat the system as a superpostion of uncoupled singlemode systems, which have been investigated in detail in Refs. [9, 46, 47]. The solution of the Heisenberg operators in this limit is\na\u0302k(z) = a\u0302 (0) k\nz + i\u03c9k(z) \u2212 i \u2211 j\ngj,kB\u0302 (0) j\n[z + i\u03c9k(z)] (z + iEj) ,\nB\u0302j(z) = B\u0302\n(0) j\nz + iEj \u2212 i \u2211 k\ngj,ka\u0302 (0) k\n(z + iEj) [z + i\u03c9k(z)]\n\u2212 \u2211 k \u2211 j1\ngj,kg \u2217 j1,k B\u0302 (0) j1\n(z + iEj) [z + i\u03c9k(z)] (z + iEj1) , (2)\nwhere a\u0302 (0) k and B\u0302 (0) j denote the initial conditions of the time evolution. We have defined the renormalized photon energy by\n\u03c9k(z) = \u03c9k \u2212 i \u2211 j |gj,k|2 z + iEj \u2192 \u03c9k + g2k\u03c1\u0393(z), (3)\nwhere the z dependence reflects a retardation effect. We have expressed the disorder average in terms of the density \u03c1 and the disorder-averaged Green\u2019s function of the unperturbed molecules \u0393(z) = \u2212i \u222b dE [P (E)/ (z + iE)]. Using Eq. (2), we can construct arbitrary retarded Green\u2019s functions such as G (L) k,k\u2032(z) \u2261 \u2212i \u2329[ a\u0302k(z), a\u0302 (0)\u2020 k\u2032\n]\u232a or G\n(M) j,j\u2032 (z) \u2261 \u2212i \u2329[ B\u0302j(z), B\u0302 (0)\u2020 j\u2032 ]\u232a . Performing the dis-\n3 FIG. 2. (a) Imaginary part of the Green\u2019s function as a function of the relative position coordinate r = rj \u2212 rj\u2032 as defined in Eq. (5). The results are shown in red (photon contribution, r > 0) and blue (molecule contribution, r < 0). The black lines depict the amplitude decay predicted by the coherence length in Eq. (7). (b) Imaginary part of the Green\u2019s function as a function of wave vector (i.e., the LDOS). The solid and dashed black lines depict the analytical predictions using Eq. (4). Parameters are the same as in Fig. 1 (d). Each Green\u2019s function has been averaged over an interval of width \u03b4 = 0.005 [eV].\norder average, the Green\u2019s function for N,L \u2192 \u221e reads as\nG (L) k,k\u2032(z) = \u2212i\n\u03b4k,k\u2032\nz + i\u03c9k(z) ,\nG (M) j,j\u2032 (z) = \u0393(z)\u03b4j,j\u2032 \u2212 i \u2211 k gj,kg \u2217 j1,k z + i\u03c9k(z) \u03c1\u0393(z)2. (4)\nThese Green\u2019s functions are equivalent to the single-mode system when the sum over k is neglected. The simple superposition of all k modes reflects the mode decoupling in the thermodynamic limit, for which the matter system becomes homogeneous in a statistical sense.\nSpectroscopy.\u2014 The wave-vector-resolved photon and molecule local density of states (LDOSs) are given as \u03bdX,k(\u03c9) \u2261 \u2212 lim\u03b4\u21930 1\u03c0 ImG (X) k,k (\u2212i\u03c9 + \u03b4) with X = L and X = M, respectively, and can be measured spectroscopically [9].\nIn Fig. 1(c), we investigate the LDOSs for EC = 0.4 eV. The LDOSs for EC = 1.0 eV and EC = 1.3 eV can be found in the Supplementary Materials [45]. The dashed lines depict the lower and upper polaritons for a vanishing disorder \u03c3 = 0. Close to \u03c9k = EM, where both\ndispersions would cross for g = 0, the lower and upper polaritons exhibit a Rabi splitting of \u2126 \u2248 2g\u221a\u03c1. The photon and molecule LDOSs closely follow the photonic dispersion curves of the disorder-free systems (dashed). The photon LDOS accumulates close to the photon dispersion \u03c9k, but also around EM close to the polariton anticrossing, where light and matter are strongly mixed. The molecule LDOS accumulates around EM, where it resembles the original disorder distribution. Along \u03c9k and away from EM, the molecule LDOS is one order of magnitude smaller than the photon LDOS. Because of level repulsion, the molecule LDOS is suppressed for energies \u03c9k at the anticrossing (purple arrow), which resembles the electromagnetically induced transparency and related effects [9, 48\u201350]. As each photon mode interacts with a disordered ensemble, the level repulsion is smeared out in the photon LDOS.\nThe photon and molecule weights of a specific eigenstate |\u03b1\u27e9 with energy \u03c9 is given as W (X)(\u03c9) \u2261 \u27e8\u03b1| P\u0302 (X) |\u03b1\u27e9 = \u2211 k \u03bdX,k(\u03c9)/\u03bd(\u03c9), where \u03bd(\u03c9) =\u2211\nX=L,M;k \u03bdX,k(\u03c9), and P\u0302 (X) is the photon (molecule) projection operator. The numerical calculation in Fig. 1 (d,e,f) verifies the analytical solution for various EC . (i) For EC = 0.4 eV < EM, the photon weight vanishes around the resonance condition \u03c9 \u2248 1 eV, as the molecules by far outnumber the photon modes in this energy region. The photon weight increases monotonically with increasing distance from the resonance condition. (ii) For EC = 1.0 eV = EM, the photon weight does not monotonically increase with distance from EM. The peak around \u03c9 \u2248 0.9 eV is a consequence of the polariton formation, causing the light field to be pushed down energetically. (iii) For EC = 1.3 eV > EM, light and matter are energetically separated such that the mutual influence is rather weak. Motivated by Ref. [32], we define dark (bright) states as eigenstates with a photonic weight W (L) < 10% (W (L) > 10%), which accumulate in the dip of the photon weight in Fig. 1(d).\nPolariton localization. Figure 2 (a) depicts the imaginary part of the Green\u2019s function in position space,\n\u03b7X,r(\u03c9) \u2261 \u2212 lim \u03b4\u21930\n1 \u03c0 ImG (X) j,j\u2032 (\u2212i\u03c9 + \u03b4) \u221d e \u2212 r2\u03b6coh , (5)\nwhere r = |rj \u2212 rj\u2032 |, for EC = 0.4 eV and three different energies \u03c9. In this definition we have used the translational invariance of the Green\u2019s function in the N \u2192 \u221e limit. The photon (molecule) Green\u2019s function is depicted for r > 0 (r < 0). Clearly, the amplitude of the Green\u2019s function shows an exponential decay with increasing r, where the coherence length \u03b6coh depends on energy.\nFigure 2(b) depicts the imaginary part of the Green\u2019s function in wave vector space, i.e., \u03bdX,k(\u03c9) for X = L,M. Overall, we observe that the widths of the Green\u2019s functions in position and wave vector space are related by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. In contrast to the photon contribution, which converges to zero for large wave\n4 FIG. 3. Coherence length as a function of Rabi splitting [(a),(c)] and disorder [(b),(d)]. Parameters are the same as in Fig. 1.\nvectors q, the molecule Green\u2019s function converges to a finite value. This is reflected by strong spatial fluctuations of the molecule Green\u2019s function in position space in Fig. 2(a), which are absent in the photon Green\u2019s function.\nFrom Eq. (4) we can determine the coherence length \u03b6coh using functional analysis, which characterizes the localization of the polaritons [45, 51]: In the L \u2192 \u221e limit, we find\n\u03b7L,r(\u03c9) \u221d G(L)j,j\u2032(\u2212i\u03c9) = \u222b dq Gq(\u03c9)e iqr, (6)\nwhere r = |rj \u2212 rj\u2032 | \u0338= 0 and Gq(\u03c9) = (\u2212i)/ [ \u2212i\u03c9 + i\u03c9qL/2\u03c0(\u2212i\u03c9) ] . Specifically, the Green\u2019s function decays as \u221d e\u2212\u03b1r, where \u03b1 is the largest value such that Gq\u2212i\u03b1\u2032 is analytic for all |\u03b1\u2032| < \u03b1. Gq has two types of non-analyticities, namely the roots of the denominator and the branch cuts along the imaginary axis \u00b1q \u2208 [iEC/c, i\u221e] due to the root in \u03c9k. As explained later, the branch cut has minor influence on \u03b7X,r, such that the coherence length is effectively determined by the root of Gq, i.e.,\n\u03b6\u22121coh = 2\nc Im\n\u221a [\u03c9 \u2212 g2\u03c1\u0393(\u2212i\u03c9)]2 \u2212 E2C , (7)\nwhere gk = g is assumed for simplicity. Interestingly, the coherence length depends via the product g \u221a \u03c1 = \u2126/2 (i.e., the Rabi frequency) on the light-matter coupling g.\nIn Figs. 1(g)-1(i) we compare the analytical expression for \u03b6coh with the numerical evaluation [45], which confirms the validity of the analytical solution. For large energies \u03c9, we observe that the coherence length diverges. For realistic parameters and energies \u03c9 \u2248 EM, the branch cuts starting at \u00b1iECc have a minor influence on the coherence length, as for a large EC , 2c/EC is significantly\nsmaller than \u03b6coh, while for small EC , the influence of the branch cut in the Fourier transformation in Eq. (6) is negligible and the Green\u2019s function is still mainly determined by the pole of the Green\u2019s function [45].\nAnalysis.\u2014 In Fig. 1 we demonstrate a correlation between the photon weight and the coherence length. As the interaction between the molecules is mediated via photons, the coherence length increases when photons can travel further without being scattered by molecules. The relation of coherence length and photon scattering can be understood by expanding the Green\u2019s function in orders of g, where destructive interference of distinct photon scattering paths decrease the coherence length for increasing g [45]. A low scattering probability is reflected by a large photon weight in the Green\u2019s function. The coherence length of the Green\u2019s function can thus be identified with the absorption length for light traveling along the extended direction of the cavity according to Beer\u2019s absorption law [45]. Dark states have a detrimental impact on the coherence length. In general, we find a clear relation of dark states with a localized Green\u2019s function, and bright states with a delocalized Green\u2019s function. The localized (delocalized) regimes are thereby described by \u03b6coh < \u03bb0 (\u03b6coh > \u03bb0), where \u03bb0 = hc/EM is the resonance wavelength of the molecular excitations.\nIn Fig. 3, we analyze the coherence length \u03b6coh as a function of \u2126 = 2g \u221a \u03c1 and \u03c3 for EC = 0.4 eV and EC = 1.0 eV. In Fig. 3(a) for small \u2126, we observe a clear linear dependence with slope \u22122 for all energies \u03c9. This can be explained by photon scattering, which consists of absorption (\u221d g\u03c1) and reemission (\u221d g). Interestingly, the coherence length for \u03c9 = 1.2 eV exhibits a dip for large \u2126, as the matter LDOS is strongly deformed and accumulates around \u03c9 = 1.2 eV, causing enhanced photon scattering.\nThe observations in Fig. 3(c) for EC = 1.0 eV and large \u03c9 = 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 eV are qualitatively similar to panel (a). The coherence length behaves very differently for small \u03c9, where the photonic modes are absent for g = 0 as \u03c9k > EC . As for these energies eigenstates can be only formed with non-resonant photon modes, the coherence length for small \u2126 is very small and almost independent of \u2126 [45]. Interestingly, the coherence length increases over more than 1 order of magnitude for \u2126 \u2248 0.3 and \u03c9 = 0.8 eV because of the peak in the photon weight for small energies \u03c9 \u2248 0.8 eV in Fig. 1(e). Analyzing the coherence length as a function of disorder in Fig. 3(b), we observe a turnover as a function of \u03c3. This is in contrast to the Anderson localization, where the coherence length monotonically decreases with disorder. Recent work has revealed a turnover of the steady-state flux as a function of disorder in the singlemode Tavis-Cummings model [8, 9, 15], which can be explained by the overlap of the photon LDOS and the molecule energy disorder distribution P (E) [9]. This interpretation can also be employed here. For small \u03c3, the disorder distribution is strongly centered around EM. With increasing \u03c3, the disorder distribution increases for\n5 \u03c9 \u0338= EM, such that more molecules can resonantly scatter the photons with energy \u03c9, which reduces the coherence length. For a large disorder, the molecule energies spread over a large energy regime, such that there are only few molecules in resonance with the photon modes close to \u03c9, which enhances the coherence length. As the Gauss distribution becomes very flat close to the center for large \u03c3, the coherence length becomes independent of \u03c9 for large \u03c3. For \u03c9 = 1.0 eV, we do not observe a turnover, as the disorder distribution P (\u03c9 \u2248 EM) decreases monotonically for increasing \u03c3. The turnovers can be also observed for EC = 1.0 eV in Fig. 3(d) for large \u03c9 = 1.1, 1.2 eV, while overall the dependence on \u03c3 is more complicated because of the significant influence of the square root dispersion relation of \u03c9k close to q = 0.\nConclusions.\u2014 We have analytically and numerically solved the multimode disordered Tavis-Cummings model and predict its dispersion and localization properties. (i) The analytical solution is built on the mode decoupling and statistical self-averaging and is exact in the thermodynamic limit. Based on the solution, wave-vectorresolved properties such as broadened spectral line shape and dispersion can be predicted effectively within the single-mode treatment, whereas spatial-dependent properties such as transport and coherence length involve a wave vector summation and thus require the multimode formalism. (ii) A coherence length is introduced to characterize the finite size of the eigenstates as a function of the excitation energy and shows transitions from localized states around the molecular energy (EM) to delocalized states away from EM. These transitions are strongly correlated with the photon weight and define a ballistic and a localized transport regime. (iii) Intriguingly, the coherence length is inversely proportional to the square of the Rabi frequency and can exhibit a turnover as a function of disorder. (iv) Both the dispersion and coherence length depend strongly on the cavity confinement energy EC : the number of available resonant photon modes and thus the light-matter coupling regime increase as the cavity changes from blueshifted (EC > EM), resonance (EC = EM), to redshifted (EC < EM). The current investigation focuses on the one-dimensional system with energetic disorder, while higher-dimensional systems with spatial and orientational disorder will be considered elsewhere.\nThe coherence length crucially depends on the light-\nmatter coupling and the disorder. For example, it can be enhanced by more than one order of magnitude with a slight increase of the light-matter interaction [cf. Fig. 3(c)]. Moreover, it can exhibit a turnover as a function of disorder, which contrasts the monotonically decreasing coherence length known from the Anderson localization, but is reminiscent of noise-assisted quantum transport [52\u201355]. Arising from the overlap of the light LDOS and the disorder distribution, this turnover is induced by the same mechanism as the transport turnover previously predicted in the single-mode disordered TavisCummings model [9]. Experimentally, this turnover can be investigated using a mixture of two molecular ensembles as in [18]. Noteworthy, the experiment in Ref. [7] has identified a transition from diffusive transport for small photonic weight to ballistic transport for large photonic weight. This observation is in perfect agreement with our analytical calculation, which predicts localized (i.e., diffusive) and delocalized (i.e., ballistic) eigenstates and a sharp transition as a function of excitation energy, as shown in Fig. 1. Theses findings reveal that the photonic weight explains the enhanced transport efficiency. In general, dark states with low photon weight correspond to localized states, while bright states with high photon weight correspond to delocalized states. The experiment in Ref. [38] indicates that phononassisted coupling of diffusive eigenstates and ballistic eigenstates helps to overcome the localization. Extending our current model in Eq. (1) to incorporate phonon modes will quantitatively demonstrate this mechanism. Moreover, as experimentally shown in [56], the detrimental impact of the cavity quality on transport properties can be modeled by a complex dispersion relation \u03c9k \u2192 \u03c9k \u2212 i\u03ba with \u03ba > 0. This will result in a complex energy shift \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c9+ i\u03ba in the coherence length in Eq. (7), leading to a suppression of transport. These and other experimental implications will be studied in future works.\nG.

(2)\nHere, j and k label the quantum emitters B\u0302j and the photonic modes a\u0302k, respectively, both fulfilling a bosonic commutation relation. The quantum emitters can represent atoms, molecules or particle-hole pairs. For concreteness, we specify to molecules in this work. The excitation energies of the molecules Ej are distributed according to a probability distribution P (E). In this work, we mainly consider a Gaussian distribution,\nP (E) = 1\u221a \u03c0\u03c3 e\u2212 (E\u2212EM)\n2\n2\u03c32 (3)\nwith center EM and width \u03c3, but our findings are also valid for arbitrary disorder models. We consider a onedimensional translational-invariant system of length L with a periodic boundary condition. The molecules are located at positions rj = jL/N . The photonic dispersion relation is given by\n\u03c9k = \u221a c2q2k + E 2 C , (4)\nwith qk = 2\u03c0k/L and integer k. The confinement energy EC appears because of the spatial confinement of the light field in the transversal direction of the microcavity. The photonic mode functions are given by \u03c6k(r) = e iqkr/ \u221a L. The light-matter coupling is parameterized by gj,k = gk\u03c6k(rj). As the excitation number\u2211 k a\u0302 \u2020 ka\u0302k + \u2211 j B\u0302 \u2020 j B\u0302j is an integral of motion, we focus on the single-excitation manifold for simplicity. In this work, we derive a closed-form expression for the Green\u2019s function of the multimode Tavis-Cummings model in the thermodynamic limit, that we define by N,L \u2192 \u221e for a constant molecule density \u03c1 = N/L."

Transforming the molecule operators into the wavevector space, B\u0302k = 1\u221a N \u2211N j=1 e iqkrj B\u0302j , we find that the Hamiltonian is block diagonal in k and reads as\nH\u0302 = \u2211 k H\u0302k,\nH\u0302k = EMB\u0302 \u2020 kB\u0302k + \u03c9ka\u0302 \u2020 ka\u0302k + g \u221a \u03c1 [ B\u0302\u2020ka\u0302k +H.c. ] , (5)\nwhere we have assumed a constant gk for simplicity. For each k, the two energies correspond to the lower and upper polaritons and are given as\nEk,lo/up = \u03c9k + EM 2 \u2213 1 2\n\u221a (\u03c9k \u2212 EM)2 +\u21262, (6)\nwhere we have defined the Rabi splitting of the disorderfree system \u2126 = 2g \u221a \u03c1. The dispersion relations of the lower and upper polariton branches are depicted in Figs. 1 - 3 by dashed lines. The corresponding eigenstates are\n|\u03a8lo(k)\u27e9 = [ cos(\u03b8)a\u0302\u2020k + sin(\u03b8)B\u0302 \u2020 k ] |vac\u27e9 ,\n|\u03a8up(k)\u27e9 = [ \u2212 sin(\u03b8)a\u0302\u2020k + cos(\u03b8)B\u0302 \u2020 k ] |vac\u27e9 , (7)\nwhere\n\u03b8 = 1\n2 arctan\n[ gk \u221a \u03c1\n\u03c9k \u2212 EM\n] + \u03c0\n2 \u03b8 (\u03c9k \u2212 EM) (8)\nwith the Heaviside function \u0398(x).\nCrucially, all molecule operators B\u0302k are coupled to the photonic operators a\u0302k with the same wave vector. Thus, in contrast to single-mode models, there are no dark states in the system. However, for very large k, the photonic energy \u03c9k by far exceeds the molecule excitation energy EM such that Ek,lo \u2192 EM and \u03b8 \u2192 \u03c0/2. In this limit, the photon modes and molecule modes k are nearly decoupled such that the molecule mode k can be considered as dark. We follow the approach suggested in Ref. [32] and classify an eigenstate according to its photon weight as dark or bright. Without disorder, the photon and molecule weights of the lower polariton are defined by\nW (L)(Ek,lo) = sin 2(\u03b8),\nW (M)(Ek,lo) = cos 2(\u03b8). (9)\nAccordingly, one can define the weights for the upper polariton. As suggested by Ref. [32], an eigenstate is clas-\n9 sified as dark, when its photon weight is below a threshold value. In this work, we adopt the threshold value W (L) th (E) = 10%. For disordered systems, a general definition of the photon and molecule weights is given in Eq. (30)."

This solution can then be used to construct arbitrary Green\u2019s functions. The Heisenberg equations for the operators in the multimode Tavis-Cummings model read as\n\u2202tB\u0302j = \u2212iEjB\u0302j \u2212 i \u2211 k gj,ka\u0302k,\n\u2202ta\u0302k = \u2212i\u03c9ka\u0302k \u2212 i \u2211 k gj,kB\u0302j .

In general, this set of coupled linear equations can not be solved analytically for a large number of photonic modes. However, we can find an exact solution in the thermodynamic limit. To see this, we first resolve Eq. (11) and obtain\nB\u0302j = B\u0302\n(0) j\nz + iEj \u2212 i \u2211 k gj,ka\u0302k z + iEj . (12)\nInserting this into Eq.

(14)\nFIG. 1. Wave-vector-resolved photon and molecule LDOSs for EC = 0.4 eV, EC = 1.0 eV and EC = 1.3 eV. Overall parameters are L = 124\u00b5m, N = 5000, EM = 1.0 eV, \u03c3 = 0.05 eV, and g \u221a \u03c1 = 0.14 eV.\nwhere \u03a0(z) will be denoted as self-energy. The third term in Eq. (13) represents an all-to-all coupling of the photonic modes, which cannot be solved in general. Fortunately, this term vanishes in the thermodynamic limit N \u2192 \u221e, as we explain in the following. To this end, we consider the factors\nAk,k1 = N\u2211 j=1 g\u2217j,kgj,k1 z + iEj\n= N\u2211 j=1 g\u2217kgk1 z + iEj \u03c6\u2217k(rj)\u03c6k1(rj)\n= g2\nL N\u2211 j=1 xj + iyj . (15)\nIn the second equality, we have inserted the parameterization gj,\u03ba = gk\u03c6k(rj). In the third line, we have introduced g as a typical measure for gk. To explain the scaling of Ak,k1 , we have excluded the cavity length L\nnormalizing the photonic mode functions \u03c6k(r) \u221d 1/ \u221a L.\nBecause of the energetic disorder, the real and imaginary parts xj and yj are samples of random variables Xj and Yj , respectively. According to the Gaussian law of large numbers, the means and the variances of the accumulated random variables scale as\u2329\nN\u2211 j=1 Xj\n\u232a \u221d \u2329 N\u2211 j=1 Yj \u232a \u221d \u03b4k1,k,\n10\nVar N\u2211 j=1 Xj \u221d Var N\u2211 j=1 Yj \u221d N. (16)\nThus, the expectation values vanish except for k1 = k, while the variances scale linearly with N . Consequently, for k1 \u0338= k we find Ak,k1 \u221d g2 \u221a N/L = g2\u03c1/ \u221a N . Thus, when approaching the thermodynamic limit N,L \u2192 \u221e while keeping the density \u03c1 constant, the terms Ak,k1 \u2192 0 with k \u0338= k1 vanish.\nCombining Eq. (12) with Eq. (13), in which we neglect the third term, we obtain the following solution for the photonic modes and molecule excitations\na\u0302k(z) = a\u0302 (0) k\nz + i\u03c9k(z) \u2212 i \u2211 j\ngj,kB\u0302 (0) j\n[z + i\u03c9k(z)] (z + iEj) ,\nB\u0302j(z) = B\u0302\n(0) j\nz + iEj \u2212 i \u2211 k\ngj,ka\u0302 (0) k\n(z + iEj) [z + i\u03c9k(z)]\n\u2212 \u2211 k \u2211 j1\ngj,kg \u2217 j1,k B\u0302 (0) j1\n(z + iEj) [z + i\u03c9k(z)] (z + iEj1) ,(17)\nrespectively."

In contrast, the Greens\u2019s functions in positions space given in Eq. (20) and (24) involve a summation of the wave vector. Therefore, we conclude that transport quantities and the coherence length cannot be accurately investigated in single-mode models. Thereby, the wave-vector summation in Eq.

For simplicity we assume a wavevector-independent light-matter interaction gk = g. All three photon and molecule LDOSs look qualitatively similar. Yet, we find that the photon LDOS for EC = 1.3 eV has a significant smaller contribution for energies close to EM than the ones for EC = 0.4 eV and EC = 1.0 eV.

For \u03c3 = 0.05 eV, we observe two separate polariton bands, that merge for \u03c3 = 0.3 eV. When further increasing to \u03c3 = 0.8 eV, the photon LDOS increasingly concentrates around the photon dispersion relation \u03c9k: for increasing \u03c3, the molecular excitation energies are distributed over a larger energy range, which leads to an increasing decoupling of photonic and molecular systems, analog to the behavior in single-mode models [9]."

In panel (b) and (c) we find that the photon weight is larger than W (L) = 50% only for energies above EM, as the photonic dispersion relation is bounded by EC from below. The panels Fig. 4 (d) - (f) depict the corresponding matter weights. Moreover, we depict the light-matter mixing, which we define as the product W (L)(\u03c9) \u00b7W (M)(\u03c9).

From Eqs. (19) and (20) we see that the molecule Green\u2019s function is proportional to the photon Green\u2019s function when gk changes only slowly with k. We thus continue to investigate the latter. In the continuum limit L \u2192 \u221e, the photon Green\u2019s function in position space [c.f., Eq. (20)] reads as\nG (L) j,j\u2032\n( \u2212i\u03c9+ ) = \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e Gq(\u2212i\u03c9)eiq(rj\u2212rj\u2032)dq,\nGq(\u2212i\u03c9) = \u2212i\n\u2212i\u03c9 + i\u03c9qL/2\u03c0 + ig2qL/2\u03c0\u03c1\u0393(\u2212i\u03c9) ,\n(33)\nwhere we can replace \u03c9+ \u2192 \u03c9 as the poles of the Green\u2019s function are not located on the real axes because of the complex-valued \u0393(z). We can analyze the asymptotic behavior of the Green\u2019s function using a theorem of functional analysis [51]:\nLet f be in L2 (Rn) (space of squareintegrable functions). Then eb|x|f \u2208 L2 (Rn) for all b < a if and only if its Fourier transformation f\u0303 has an analytic continuation to the set {\u03b6 | |\u03b6| < a} with the property that for each \u03b7 \u2208 Rn with |\u03b7| < a, f\u0303(\u00b7+ i\u03b7) \u2208 L2 (Rn) and for any b < a: sup|\u03b7|\u2264b ||f(\u00b7+ i\u03b7)||2 < \u221e.\nApplied to the Fourier transformation in Eq. (33), this theorem states that the asymptotic behavior of the Green\u2019s function is determined by the poles and branch cuts of the integrand (i.e., the Green\u2019s function in wave vector space), where q is now interpreted as a complex variable.\nFor simplicity, we consider the case gk = g. In this case the integrand Gq is nonanalytic at\nq\u2217,1 = 1\nc\n\u221a [\u03c9 \u2212 g2\u03c1\u0393(\u2212i\u03c9)]2 \u2212 E2C ,\nq\u2217,2 = i EC c , (34)\nas well as the complex conjugate values. Thereby, q\u2217,1 appears because of the pole of the Green\u2019s function Gq, q\u2217,2 appears because of the branch cut induced by the photonic dispersion relation in Eq. (4). According to the above theorem, the asymptotic behavior is mainly determined by the nonanalyticity whose imaginary part is closer to zero. In Fig. 5, we sketch two cases: (i) |Im q\u2217,1| < |Im q\u2217,2|, and (ii) |Im q\u2217,1| > |Im q\u2217,2|. In case (i), we find that the asymptotic decay is determined by the pole of the Green\u2019s function. In this case, the coherence length depends on the light-matter interaction and other system parameters. In case (ii), the branch cut and, consequently, the ratio EC/c determines the asymptotic behavior. In short, the asymptotic behavior for large r = |rj \u2212 rj\u2032 | can be written as\u2223\u2223\u2223G(L)j,j\u2032 (\u2212i\u03c9+)\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2192 a1e\u2212 r2\u03b6coh,1 + a2e\u2212 r2\u03b6coh,2 , (35) where we have defined the coherence lengths\n\u03b6coh,i = 1\n2Im q\u2217,i (36)\nfor i = 1, 2. In the numerical calculations we find that the asymptotic behavior is accurately determined by q\u2217,1, see Sec. II B. For this reason, we assess that the coefficients fulfill a1 \u226b a2, and we define the system\u2019s coherence length as \u03b6coh \u2261 \u03b6coh,1.\n14\nIn the Letter, the coherence length for different values of the confinement energy EC is shown in Figs. 1(g)(i). Comparing with the photon weight, we observe a clear correlation between both quantities, that will be explained in the next section. Consequently, the coherence length is very short in the energy range close to \u03c9 \u2248 EM, that exhibits dark states. From this observation we conclude that dark states have an overall destructive impact on transport properties.\nIt is also instructive to investigate the coherence length for a small light-matter interaction. Taylor expansion of Eq. (34) up to first order in g2\u03c1 results in\n\u03b6\u22121coh = 1\nc Im\n[\u221a \u03c92 \u2212 E2C \u2212\n\u03c9\u221a \u03c92 \u2212 E2C g2\u03c1\u0393(\u2212i\u03c9) ] +O [( g2\u03c1 )2] , (37)\nwhich exhibits a different behavior depending on the energy \u03c9. For \u03c9 > EC , the first term in Eq. (37) is real valued and the coherence length is essentially determined by the imaginary part of \u0393(\u2212i\u03c9). This analysis thus reveals why the coherence length decreases with \u221d (g2\u03c1)\u22121 in Fig. 3(a) and (c) in the Letter for \u03c9 > EC . As the imaginary part of \u0393(\u2212i\u03c9) is given by the molecular disorder distribution P (E), the coherence length is proportional to the number of molecules having excitation energy Ej = \u03c9. Noteworthy, for EC = 0, the inverse coherence length\n\u03b6\u22121coh \u221d g 2\u03c1P (\u03c9) (38)\nis proportional to Beer\u2019s absorption length, which is consistent with the unraveling of the Green\u2019s function in terms of scattering processes below in Sec. I I.\nFor \u03c9 < EC , the first term becomes imaginary and gives a constant contribution to \u03b6\u22121coh. Now, the real part of \u0393(\u2212i\u03c9) determines the dependence on g\u221a\u03c1. Interestingly when the energy \u03c9 approaches EC from above, the coherence length increases. Formally for \u03c9 = EC , the coherence length diverges, yet, we note that the Taylor expansion is invalid in this case. Thus, from Eq. (37) we cannot conclude that the coherence length is non-analytic at \u03c9 = EC .\nI. Interpretation\nInterestingly, the coherence length is a function of the Rabi frequency \u2126 = 2g \u221a \u03c1. Analysis of the coherence length shows that it scales with \u03b6coh \u221d \u2126\u22122 for small \u2126, as can be seen in Figs. 3(a) and (c) in the Letter. In this section, we interpret this behavior in terms of photon scattering.\nExpanding the photon Green\u2019s function in position\nspace in orders of g, we obtain\nG (L) j,j\u2032(z) = \u2211 k G (L) j,j\u2032(z, k),\nG (L) j,j\u2032(z, k) = G (0) j,j\u2032(k) + g\n2 N\u2211\nj1=1\nG (0) j,j1 (k)\u0393j1G (0) j1,j\u2032 (k)\n+ g4 N\u2211\nj1,j2=1\nG (0) j,j1 (k)\u0393i1G (0) j1,j2 (k)\u0393i2G (0) j2,j\u2032 (k)\n+ O(g6), (39)\nwhere\nG (0) i,j (k) = G (0) i,j (z, k) = \u2212i\n\u03c6k(ri)\u03c6 \u2217 k(rj)\nz + i\u03c9k ,\n\u0393j = \u0393j(z) = \u2212i 1\nz + iEj (40)\ndenote the free Green\u2019s functions of photon mode k and molecule j, respectively. Thus, the full Green\u2019s function is a sum of k-dependent Green\u2019s functions, that can be unraveled as a series of scattering processes. The first term (\u221d g0), describes the propagation of a photon without scattering events. The second term describes a single scattering at molecule j1. Both absorption and emission contribute one factor g. Noteworthy, Im\u0393j(\u2212i\u03c9) is proportional to the linear absorption of a two-level systems in dipole approximation. As there are N molecules in the cavity, this terms scales overall with \u221d g2N . Accordingly, the third term can be interpreted as two scattering events and scales with \u221d g4N2. Each term in Eq. (39) can be interpreted as a distinct path from rj to rj\u2032 .\nFor increasing g2N , more higher-order paths become relevant in the expansion in Eq. (39). Due to the random phase factors of \u03c6k(rj), this leads to a destructive interference between different paths, which suppresses the probability that a photon can travel from rj to rj\u2032 . This is reflected by a shorter coherence length of the Green\u2019s function.\nThe disorder distribution of the molecular excitation energies P (E) thereby determines the number of molecules that can take part in this scattering process. Only molecules whose excitation energy Ej exactly matches the energy of the eigenstate \u03c9(= iz) can resonantly scatter photons, which mediate the formation of the eigenstates. Thereby, the more a photon is scattered at molecules the smaller is the photon weight, which explains the close correspondence of photon weight and coherence length in Fig. 1 in the Letter. This analysis motivates to identify the coherence length as the absorption length known in Beer\u2019s absorption law, which opens an alternative way for the experimental verification of the predictions in our work.\n15"

For EM = 1 eV, we find that \u03bb0 = 1.24\u00b5m. Thus, expressed in units of \u03bb0, the cavity length is L = 100\u03bb0, and the particle density is \u03c1 = N/L = 50/\u03bb0. We quantize the photonic field with N = 5000 modes, such that the cut-off energy is \u03c9cut-off = \u03c9k=5000 =\u221a\nc2(\u03c050/L)2 + E2C \u2248 50 \u00b7 EM. In total, we average over M = 50 sample Hamiltonians.\nIn the diagonalization, the photon and molecule subsystems are represented in the wave vector basis and position basis, respectively. The construction of the Green\u2019s function requires a transformation between these representations. We denote the elements of the photon subsystem of an eigenstates \u03b1 with energy \u03f5\u03b1 by \u03a8 (L) \u03b1 (qk), and the molecule subsystem elements by \u03a8 (M) \u03b1 (rj). Using the photonic mode functions \u03c6k(r), we can transform the photon subsystem into the position representation via\n\u03a8(L)\u03b1 (rj) =\n\u221a L\n2N2 N\u2211 k=1 \u03c6k(rj)\u03a8 (L) \u03b1 (qk). (41)\nThe additional factor \u221a L/2N is required due to the discretization of the photon field in position space. It ensures that the photon weight remains unchanged\nin the transformation: W (L)(\u03f5a) = \u2211\nj \u2223\u2223\u2223\u03a8(L)\u03b1 (rj)\u2223\u2223\u22232 =\u2211 k\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03a8(L)\u03b1 (qk)\u2223\u2223\u22232. Accordingly, we can transform the matter subsystem into the wave vector representation:\n\u03a8(M)\u03b1 (qk) =\n\u221a L\n2N2 N\u2211 j=1 \u03c6k(rj)\u03a8 (M) \u03b1 (qk). (42)"

Importantly, the asymptotic behavior of \u03b7X,r(\u03c9) for large r exhibits the same scaling as Eq. (35).\nIn Fig. 6, we depict \u03b72X,r(\u03c9)/N for both X = L,M as a function of position by a solid green line. The normalization N is chosen such that the integral over the position is one. We depicted the squared function to allow for a better comparison with the disorder-averaged eigenstates defined later in Eq. (47).\nThe decay of the Green\u2019s function with increasing separation |r| is clearly visible for both photon and molecule Green\u2019s functions. For comparison, we have added the exponential decay predicted by the analytical coherence length \u03b6coh,1 in Eq. (36) as a dash-dotted black line. We observe that the numerical and analytical calculations precisely agree, which is especially clearly visible for the molecule Green\u2019s function. We thus conclude that the asymptotic behavior of the Green\u2019s function is determined by \u03b6coh = \u03b6coh,1 and that a1 \u226b a2 in Eq. (35). This assessment is additionally confirmed by the agreement of the analytical and numerical calculations of the coherence length shown in Fig. 1 (g)-(i) in the Letter .\nIn Fig. 6, the photon Green\u2019s function is more smooth than the matter contribution and exhibits a modulation as a function of separation r. The modulation frequency is determined by the real part of the root q\u2217,1 in Eq. (34). We explain the deviation from a mononchromatic modulation by the finite energy integral, over which we average the Green\u2019s function in Eq. (44)."

(45) for k = k\u2032.\nGuided by the analytical and numerical calculations of the Green\u2019s function, we anticipate that the exponential decay of the disorder-averaged wavefunction is dominated by one exponential term. Similar to the Green\u2019s function in Eq. (35), we thus define the localization length \u03b6loc such that\u2223\u2223\u03a8(X)(r)\u2223\u22232 \u221d exp [\u2212 |r|\n\u03b6loc(\u03c9)\n] (49)\nfor large |r|. In Fig. 6, we depict the disorder-averaged eigenstates and observe that the photon contribution of the wave function exponentially decays with |r|. The fluctuations are significantly less than the fluctuations in the Green\u2019s function. Interestingly, we observe that the disorderaveraged eigenstates and the Green\u2019s function exhibit the same decay behavior for small-to-intermediate |r|, i.e., \u03b6coh \u2248 \u03b6loc. We attribute this agreement to the photon-mediated long-range interaction between distant molecules, which protects their coherent phase relation.\nFor very large |r|, the eigenstates decay significantly slower than the Green\u2019s function. These deviations can have two distinct explanations: (i) the Green\u2019s function is subject to significant destructive interference because of the average over the finite energy interval in Eq. (44). (ii) The numerical calculation suffers from a finite computational precision. Importantly, we have numerically checked that this slow decay is not determined by the branch-cut related value \u03b6coh,2 in Eq. (36), which would predict a significantly faster decay rate."

In particular, we use F (r) = \u03b72M,r(\u03c9)/N . Here, we use X = M, as the molecule Green\u2019s function does not exhibit (almost) monochromatic smooth modulations like the photon Green\u2019s function (c.f., Fig. 6). While for the monochromatic modulation of the photon Green\u2019s function, F (r) must be multiplied by a cosine function with an unknown frequency, the high-frequent fluctuations of the molecule Green\u2019s function simply average away.

This numerical approach assumes that there is only one exponentially decaying term, as opposed to the two terms predicted in Eq. (35). However, the analysis in Fig. 6 has shown that only the pole of the Green\u2019s function substantially determines the decaying behavior, while the branch-cut term can be neglected. For this reason, the deployed numerical procedure provides a value for the coherence length related to the Green\u2019s function pole. We emphasize that the precise agreement of the analytical and numerical calculations in Fig. 1(g)-(i) in the Letter justifies the numerical approach introduced here."
