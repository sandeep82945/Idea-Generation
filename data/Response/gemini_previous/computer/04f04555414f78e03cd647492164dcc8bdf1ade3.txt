1. **Investigate the use of different pre-trained language models (PLMs) for argument mining.** The paper uses RoBERTa as the PLM, but other PLMs such as BERT, GPT-3, and XLNet could also be explored. Different PLMs have different strengths and weaknesses, and it would be interesting to see how they compare on the task of argument mining.


2. **Explore the use of different attention mechanisms for argument mining.** The paper uses a self-attention mechanism to capture the correlation information of argument components. However, other attention mechanisms, such as multi-head attention, dot-product attention, and scaled dot-product attention, could also be explored. Different attention mechanisms have different properties, and it would be interesting to see how they compare on the task of argument mining.


3. **Investigate the use of different loss functions for argument mining.** The paper uses a cross-entropy loss function, but other loss functions, such as the mean squared error loss function, the hinge loss function, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence loss function, could also be explored. Different loss functions have different properties, and it would be interesting to see how they compare on the task of argument mining.


4. **Explore the use of different evaluation metrics for argument mining.** The paper uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as evaluation metrics, but other metrics, such as the Matthews correlation coefficient, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and the area under the precision-recall curve, could also be explored. Different evaluation metrics have different properties, and it would be interesting to see how they compare on the task of argument mining.


5. **Investigate the use of argument mining for different applications.** The paper focuses on the use of argument mining for legal and financial texts, but argument mining could also be used for other applications, such as political science, marketing, and healthcare. It would be interesting to explore how argument mining can be used to improve decision-making in these different domains.
