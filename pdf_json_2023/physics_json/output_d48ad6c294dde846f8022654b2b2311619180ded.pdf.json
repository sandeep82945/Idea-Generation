    "abstractText": "The present study aimed to characterize the antiproliferative and antimetastatic properties of two recently synthesized monoterpene-aminopyrimidine hybrids (1 and 2) on A2780 ovary cancer cells. Both agents exerted a more pronounced cell growth inhibitory action than the reference agent cisplatin, as determined by the MTT assay. Tumor selectivity was assessed using non-cancerous fibroblast cells. Hybrids 1 and 2 induced changes in cell morphology and membrane integrity in A2780 cells, as evidenced by Hoechst 33258\u2013propidium iodide fluorescent staining. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry revealed substantial changes in the distribution of A2780 ovarian cancer cells, with an increased rate in the subG1 and G2/M phases, at the expense of the G1 cell population. Moreover, the tested molecules accelerated tubulin polymerization in a cell-free in vitro system. The antimetastatic properties of both tested compounds were investigated by wound healing and Boyden chamber assays after 24 and 48 h of incubation. Treatment with 1 and 2 resulted in timeand concentration-dependent inhibition of migration and invasion of A2780 cancer cells. These results support that the tested agents may be worth of further investigation as promising anticancer",

            "text": "According to estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer ranks as one of the major health burdens and a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Therefore, it can be concluded that malignancies are the leading cause of premature death in developed countries. Based on the latest Global Cancer Observatory (GLOBOCAN) survey, 19.3 million new cancer cases, and almost ten million cancer-related deaths were registered in 2020. Several factors, including aging and population growth, as well as the prevalence and distribution of the main risk factors for cancer can lead to such a high cancer incidence and mortality, rapidly growing globally [1,2]. Among females, gynecological malignancies are the most commonly diagnosed tumor types and the leading causes of cancer death. Accordingly, ovarian cancer is the most lethal female reproductive cancer, associated with the highest mortality rate among gynecological tumors. In most cases, it is diagnosed at an advanced stage, when the cancer already spread to other tissues [3]. Several risks factors for the development of ovarian cancer were identified, including family history of ovarian cancer in a first-degree relative, genetic predisposition (e.g.,\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 10581. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241310581 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 10581 2 of 17\nmutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes), hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, endometriosis, postmenopausal hormone therapy, and lifestyle effects, for instance, obesity and smoking [4]. The lack of specific symptoms and adequate screening can lead to delayed diagnosis in advanced stages with high dissemination of the disease, all contributing to poor prognosis [5,6]. Correspondingly, novel treatment options, including innovative drugs with improved efficacy profiles, are eagerly required. The research for and development of novel oncology agents posed significant challenges for all aspects of chemistry and pharmacology since the early 1940s [7]. Initially, most of the materials screened were pure compounds of synthetic origin; however, it was recognized that natural products are an excellent source of complex chemical structures possessing a wide variety of biological activities [8]. As a result, many natural products were introduced into clinical trials and clinical practice, and were used as lead or model molecules for structure optimization, as well as for developing safer and more tolerable drugs [9]. The best-known of currently used anticancer drugs are Vinca alkaloids vinblastine and vincristine. These agents can be isolated from endophytic fungi associated with the source plant. They act via tubulin polymerization, and are utilized in combination with other anticancer agents in various cancer types (leukemia, advanced testicular cancer, breast cancer, etc.). They exert their antitumor effect via binding microtubular proteins, which leads to disturbed tubulin polymerization and disrupts microtubule assembly during mitosis, as well as induces the metaphase arrest of the cell cycle [10]. Another natural anticancer agent, paclitaxel, was isolated from the bark of Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia), and also occurs in the leaves of various Taxus species. It is also widely utilized in oncology, to treat, for example, breast, ovarian, and non-small cell lung cancer, etc. By stabilizing the microtubule polymer and preventing microtubules from disassembly, paclitaxel arrests the cell cycle in the G0/G1 and G2/M phases and, thus, induces cell death [11]. Several binding sites were identified on the surface of the dimer of \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin. These include the vinca site binding Vinca alkaloids, colchicine site binding colchicine, combretastatins, and 2-methoxyestradiol and taxane site binding taxanes and epothilones [12]. Although natural anticancer agents can be potent, they tend to have poor pharmacokinetic properties; thus, chemical derivatization is required to obtain novel analogs suitable for further drug development [8]. The significance of natural products in health care is supported by a report claiming that over 60% of current anticancer agents in clinical use are natural products, their derivatives or analogs, and 74% of the essential drugs consist of plant-derived active ingredients [10]. Terpenoids are the largest class of natural products, and represent an important class of secondary plant metabolites. They are composed of five carbon isoprene units, and they are divided into subclasses based on their structures [11]. They can target several stages of cancer development, including cell proliferation, cell death, angiogenesis, and metastasis formation [13]. The anticancer effect of several terpenoids is mediated by targeting nuclear factor kB (NF-kB), Janus kinases-signal transducer and activated transcription proteins (JAK-STAT), activator protein-1 (AP-1), metalloproteinases (MMPs) and DNA topoisomerase I and II, or the relevant compounds may block the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) the calcium ATPase pump, inhibit the proteasome, activate p53, and modulate DNA minor grooves [14]. Terpenoids were reported to induce cell death by a particular form of apoptosis called autophagy. It is a self-digesting process characterized by forming double-membrane vacuoles and autophagosomes, followed by merging with lysosomes. These processes can lead to the degradation of molecules; thus, organelles become dysfunctional [15]. Monoterpenes exhibit a wide variety of biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antioxidant actions. Numerous scientific works explored the bioactivity of monoterpenes, including their anticancer potential in particular, providing in vitro evi-\nInt. J. Mol.

In a previous study, we reported on synthesizing a series of monoterpene-based diaminopyrimidine analogs, and we successfully demonstrated their antiproliferative properties in vitro on a panel of human adherent cancer cell lines [16]. Two of the prepared and tested analogs, 1 and 2 (Figure 1), exhibited outstanding activity. Our current study aimed to assess the antitumor and antimetastatic properties of these potent analogs, as well as to elucidate their mechanism of action.\nInt. J. Mol.

Those investigated in the current study (compounds 1 and 2) were found to exhibit a remarkable antiproliferative effect against A2780 cells (calculated IC50 values: 0.77 \u00b5M and 2.86 \u00b5M, respectively; Table 1). The obtained IC50 values were comparable to that of the reference agent cisplatin. Noncancerous fibroblast cells (NIH/3T3) were also utilized to characterize tumor selectivity (TS) of the test substances. Based on these results, our compounds are selective towards ovarian carcinoma cells. Therefore, the A2780 cell line was selected for further in vitro investigations aimed at elucidating the mechanism of action of 1 and 2."

Consequently, innumerable terpenoids with anticancer potential were described recently [17\u201319]. The importance of natural compounds and their derivatives in the research and development of anticancer agents is continuously increasing. In a previous study, we investigated some newly synthesized monoterpene-based 2,4-diaminopyrimidine derivatives, and concluded that two of them exhibited remarkable antiproliferative activities [16]. Our present study aimed to assess the antitumor and antimetastatic properties of these potent analogs, as well as to elucidate the mechanism of their action. Antiproliferative assays were performed with these two monoterpene-based 2,4-diaminopyrimidine type derivatives (1 and 2) on a panel of human adherent cell lines (Hela, SiHa, MCF-7, MDAMB-231, and A2780) to calculate IC50 values.

Moreover, under the experimental conditions used, the potency of our test compounds was found to be comparable to that of cisplatin, a standard drug routinely used in the therapy of ovarian carcinomas [20]. Tumor specificity is one of the greatest challenges new anticancer drug candidates tend to face. These potent analogs exhibited higher IC50 values on NIH/3TE non-cancerous fibroblasts than on ovary cancer cells, indicating high tumor selectivity. In addition to cancer selectivity, apoptosis induction is a critical feature expected from lead compounds to be suitable for further development as an anticancer agent. Several plant-derived natural products, capable to induce apoptosis, were tested in clinical trials. In general, apoptosis plays a crucial role in controlling and possibly terminating the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells. Utilizing the cellular mechanisms that induce cell death is an exploitable and practical approach in cancer therapy [21,22]. The apoptosisinducing properties of our currently investigated analogs (1 and 2) were demonstrated by fluorescent double staining and cell cycle analysis. The early process of apoptosis is characterized by morphological changes at the cellular level, including cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and loss of membrane integrity [21]. These phenomena were visualized by Hoechst 33,258 and propidium iodide fluorescent staining, which was applied on A2780 cells after 24 h and 48 h of incubation with different concentrations of 1 and 2. Substantial and statistically significant increases in the proportion of apoptotic and necrotic cell populations were observed in A2780 samples treated with either of the test compounds, indicating their possible proapoptotic properties. Furthermore, increasing the concentration of the test compounds led to the appearance of late apoptotic or secondary necrotic cells, showing a loss of membrane function visualized by propidium iodide. To assess the mechanism of action of 1 and 2, cell cycle analyses were carried out by flow cytometry on the A2780 cell line. Both test compounds induced a concentrationdependent disturbance of cell cycle. In general, the most noticeable consequence of treatment was the elevation of G2/M populations and the accumulation of hypodiploid (subG1) cells at the expense of the G1 population. Furthermore, the increase in the G2/M population was typically more substantial after 48 h than after 24 h of incubation, indicating cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. In addition, the proportion of the hypodiploid subG1 fraction, regarded as the apoptotic cell population, increased in a concentration-dependent manner, supporting the proapoptotic property of 1 and 2 in the A2780 cell line. This finding aligns with recent studies showing that terpenoids typically cause G2/M arrest of the cell cycle and apoptotic cell death in different human cancer cell lines [23,24]. Several studies revealed that some terpenoids induced pronounced cell cycle arrest via direct influence on tubulin polymerization during mitosis [25\u201327]. Tubulin polymerization is a well-organized and crucial process of mitotic cell division. It is generally accepted that tubulin-binding agents induce cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase via the disruption of microtubule dynamics. Since 1 and 2 was detected to arrest cell cycle in the G2/M phase, it\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 10581 13 of 17\nwas rational to investigate the direct effect of these analogs on tubulin polymerization in an in vitro cell-free system. Both compounds, and especially compound 2 at 300 \u00b5M, increased the maximum rate of microtubule formation and enhanced tubulin polymerization, as reflected by significantly increased Vmax values. Consequently, imbalance between the polymerization and depolymerization of microtubules occurred, leading to cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that our test compounds may have a paclitaxel-like microtubule-stabilizing effect. Previously, numerous papers reported that ovarian carcinoma has the highest caseto-fatality ratio among all gynecologic malignancies. It is characterized by rapid growth, early metastasis development, and a generally aggressive disease course. Having no early signs and symptoms that may warm for the diagnosis, the high mortality of ovarian cancer is mainly attributable to the fact that most patients present at an advanced stage, with extensive metastatic disease [28]. During tumor progression, including invasive growth and metastasis development, cell invasion is crucial for cancer spread and for the appearance of distant metastases. To achieve reduction in the mortality of ovarian carcinoma, research for novel drug candidates capable of interfering with metastasis formation is eagerly required. The metastatic cascade represents a multi-step process, involving cancer cell migration and invasion through the basement membrane to reach the extracellular matrix and neighboring tissues [29]. In our study, compounds 1 and 2 significantly inhibited the invasion and migration of A2780 cells after 48 h of exposure. We also demonstrated that the inhibition of cell motility becomes apparent at 0.5 \u00b5M of 1 and 1.5 \u00b5M of 2, which are below the concentration of substantial antiproliferative activity. Our findings indicate that besides their antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and tubulin-disrupting activities, compounds 1 and 2 also can be potent antimigratory agents because of their significant inhibitory effects on cell migration and invasion. Our study is the first one to demonstrate the mechanism of action of monoterpene-based 2,4-diaminopyrimidine derivatives on tumor cells, clarifying our understanding of how they influence cell cycle, apoptosis, and motility of cancer cells. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that compounds 1 and 2 are promising antiproliferative agents in vitro; both cause G2/M phase disturbance during the cell cycle presumably by stabilizing tubulin polymers, leading to programmed cell death. In addition to their proapoptotic effect, they are suggested to show antimetastatic potential in the utilized ovarian cancer cell line. Based on our findings presented above, the tested compounds can be regarded as potential new drug candidates with a promising new mechanism of action among terpenoids possessing antiproliferative properties, and they may be utilized for the design of novel anticancer agents."
