Piperacillin is inactivated by commonly carried 28 resistance enzymes, but tazobactam inhibits these allowing successful treatment. The effect of 29 piperacillin on Gram-negative bacteria has been widely studied, but less attention has been paid to 30 the effects of tazobactam. We used a massive transposon mutagenesis approach (TraDIS-Xpress) 31 to determine the genes in Escherichia coli that affect survival when exposed to piperacillin and 32 tazobactam, separately and together. We found significant differences in the selective pressure of 33 the two drugs: a striking finding was that multiple efflux pump families and regulators were 34 essential for survival in the presence of tazobactam, but only one efflux system was beneficial for 35 piperacillin. Additionally, we identified the shikimate kinase AroK as a potential target for 36 tazobactam. This method also found that genes involved in DNA replication and repair reduced E. 37 coli susceptibility to a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam, not seen from either drug 38 treatment alone. Treatment of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae with piperacillin and/or 39 tazobactam selected for mutants with reduced susceptibility, and SNP analyses supported the 40 TraDIS-Xpress findings that tazobactam selects for changes in membrane permeability and 41 maintenance associated with multidrug-resistance. Increased efflux activity is an important 42 foundation of multidrug resistance in human pathogens, therefore the finding that tazobactam can 43 select for this is concerning. These findings could have consequences for antibiotic prescription 44 and should inform the development of future \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors to reduce the global increase in 45 multidrug-resistant infections. 46\n3\nIntroduction 47 Piperacillin-Tazobactam is one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotic treatments in the UK, 48 used to treat a wide range of infections including pneumonia, urinary tract infections and skin and 49 soft tissue infections (Perry and Markham, 1999). Beta-lactam antibiotics such as piperacillin 50 disrupt peptidoglycan synthesis, an essential component of the bacterial cell envelope. Resistance 51 to this class of antibiotic can however be conferred by genes coding for \u03b2-lactamases which cleave 52 the \u03b2-lactam ring, rendering the antibiotic ineffective. A wide variety of extended-spectrum \u03b2-53 lactamases have been described and have increased in prevalence since the first was described in 54 1983 (Knothe et al., 1983). These can be chromosomal but are often spread on conjugative 55 plasmids and are now common in many species including those causing both hospital-acquired 56 and community-acquired infections (Cant\u00f3n et al., 2008). To prevent the activity of \u03b2-lactamases, 57 \u03b2-lactam antibiotics can be given in conjunction with a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor, such as Tazobactam. 58 These inhibit \u03b2-lactamase enzymes so that activity of the antibiotic is protected. Extensive 59 research has been conducted on how the cell responds to treatment with \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, 60 including piperacillin (Kong et al., 2010). However, relatively little work has focussed on how 61 bacteria respond to \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors, including tazobactam and whether these compounds 62 have any significant activity beyond their interactions with \u03b2-lactamases (Tooke et al., 2019). 63 64 Large-scale genomic screens have previously been used to identify the extended complement of 65 genes and pathways that affect susceptibility to a given antibiotic, including genes beyond the 66 principal target. These methods have often revealed many genes contribute to sensitivity to 67 antibiotics to varying degrees. We have used one such method, TraDIS-Xpress, where massively 68 dense transposon mutant libraries investigate bacterial loci involved in responses to stress at 69 almost base pair resolution. These libraries make use of a transposon-encoded outward-70 transcribing inducible promoter, which allows changes in gene expression as well as gene 71 disruption to be assayed for roles in survival under a given stress. This provides information about 72 essential genes, which are often those of interest for antibiotics that usually target essential genes. 73 This approach has recently been used to identify known and unknown mechanisms of action and 74 resistance to triclosan (Yasir et al., 2020), fosfomycin (Turner et al., 2020b), fluoroquinolones 75 (Turner et al., 2020a), meropenem (Thomson et al., 2022), trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole 76 (Turner et al., 2021). 77 78 In this study we used TraDIS-Xpress to identify how Escherichia coli responds to piperacillin and 79 tazobactam, separately and in combination. We identified known genes involved in sensitivity to 80 piperacillin but also found many genes under selective pressure after exposure to tazobactam. 81 These included a suite of genes involved in multiple drug resistance with multidrug efflux pumps 82 and regulators, whereas only one efflux system was implicated in piperacillin susceptibility. To 83 explore the implications of these findings, we exposed E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae to both 84\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Analysis of these resistant 85 mutants revealed tazobactam selected for mutations in genes involved in efflux activity and 86 regulation and membrane permeability more readily than piperacillin. The demonstration that 87 tazobactam promotes selection of multidrug resistance shows the impact of \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors 88 on target bacteria warrants further study. 89\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The variation of sequence reads per insertion site 95 between replicates was low for all conditions tested (supplementary figure 1), indicating a high 96 degree of experimental correlation. 97 98 After exposure to tazobactam alone, TraDIS-Xpress found many efflux systems affected 99\nsusceptibility. Increased expression of acrA, acrB, acrE, acrF, mdtE, mdtF and mdfA appeared to 100 reduce susceptibility to tazobactam, whilst transposon insertions into these genes increased 101 susceptibility (Figure 1). The same could be seen for positive regulators of these systems (marA, 102 soxS and rob), where increased expression was beneficial to survival and inactivation was 103 detrimental to survival in the presence of tazobactam. Transposon insertions in negative regulators 104 of efflux strongly reduced susceptibility to tazobactam: the log2-fold differences in insertions in acrR 105 (11.8), marR (14.9) and soxR (15.3) indicate a very strong selective pressure favouring inactivation 106 of these genes in the presence of tazobactam. In contrast to the tazobactam data, when the library 107 was exposed to piperacillin alone only acrA and acrR were found to affect fitness with smaller log 108 fold changes in insertion frequency (Supplementary table 1). This data reveals that efflux activity 109 and regulation is extremely important for survival in the presence of tazobactam, but not for 110 piperacillin. When piperacillin and tazobactam were combined, increased expression of acrA, acrB, 111 acrE, acrF, marA, soxS and rob were beneficial to survival which reflects the combined selective 112 impact of both drugs. 113\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

The Lon protease is 123 one of these, which reduces the availability of the efflux activators MarA and SoxS. Following 124 growth in tazobactam there was a large (7.4 log2-fold) increase in insertion mutations in lon 125 compared to controls without tazobactam, indicating that inactivation of Lon increases susceptibility 126 to tazobactam, possibly due to the absence of its protease activity upon MarA and SoxS efflux 127 activators. In the presence of piperacillin alone the opposite was true, and Lon activity reduced 128 susceptibility. This was also seen for genes involved in the synthesis of osmoregulated periplasmic 129 glucans, opgG and opgH, which increased tazobactam susceptibility and reduced piperacillin 130 susceptibility. Osmoregulated periplasmic glucans have been previously linked to efflux activity 131 (Holden et al., 2023) and are thought to affect the activity of two component signalling systems 132 (Bontemps-Gallo et al., 2017, Bontemps-Gallo et al., 2013), which were also found to have a 133 strong effect on tazobactam susceptibility. The PhoPQ signal transduction system reduced 134 tazobactam susceptibility and the CpxAR system increased susceptibility. These two signalling 135 systems have also previously been implicated in efflux activity and may affect tazobactam 136 susceptibility through this route (Holden et al., 2023). Altogether, we show how the genes involved 137 in efflux regulation and membrane integrity affect survival differently in the presence of each drug, 138 highlighting of the mechanisms through which the cell may tailor its drug response to each drug. 139 140 To validate the results of these TraDIS-Xpress experiments, E. coli was cultured under increasing 141 concentrations of piperacillin, tazobactam and a combination of the two to select for resistant 142 mutants. In the population of mutants selected in the presence of tazobactam, whole genome 143 nucleotide sequencing identified four separate single nucleotide mutations related to efflux 144 (supplementary table 2). These included a frameshift mutation in acrR and three distinct mutations 145 in marR, both repressors of efflux. In the population exposed to piperacillin alone, one frameshift in 146 marR was identified as well as a missense mutation in rpoD, which encodes a sigma factor 147 involved in exponential growth (Shimada et al., 2014). To determine if similar selective pressures 148 may be exerted by each drug in other pathogenic bacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae was treated 149 similarly with piperacillin and/or tazobactam to select for resistant mutants. In mutants selected 150 with tazobactam with or without piperacillin, mutations in acrR were found again, showing that 151 tazobactam selects for increased efflux pump expression in K. pneumoniae (supplementary table 152 2). Other genes were also mutated including those affecting membrane permeability and integrity. 153 These included the outer membrane porin ompC (Cai and Inouye, 2002), cpxA involved in 154 regulating membrane integrity (Batchelor et al., 2005), rfbB and rfbD involved in O-antigen 155 biosynthesis and export (Stevenson et al., 1994) and ftsI encoding penicillin binding protein 3 156 (Suzuki et al., 1978). Together with our findings in E. coli, this demonstrates that tazobactam can 157 select for changes in efflux and membrane permeability in two distinct human pathogens. 158 159 160\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Supporting this finding, we also found a frameshift variant of aroK in an E. coli mutant 166 continuously exposed to increasing concentrations of piperacillin and tazobactam (Table 1). AroK 167 is a shikimate kinase involved in chorismate biosynthesis, an intermediate in the synthesis of 168 phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan and also a precursor of folic acid, ubiquinone, 169 menaquinone, and enterochelin (Vinella et al., 1996). AroK is one of two shikimate kinases in E. 170 coli alongside AroL. We did not see a significant difference in transposon insertion frequency within 171 aroL in the TraDIS-Xpress data after tazobactam exposure compared to controls. Deletion of aroK 172 or aroL did not significantly affect tazobactam susceptibility in E. coli (data not shown). 173 174\n175\nFigure 2: Insertion frequency in and around aroK and aroL in E. coli treated with piperacillin and 176 tazobactam, both separately and in combination, relative to unstressed controls.

These included 186 genes involved in tRNA modification and fidelity (truA (Kammen et al., 1988), mnmE and mnmG 187 (Br\u00e9geon et al., 2001)), ribosome biogenesis, (bipA (Choudhury and Flower, 2015)), as well as 188 dsbA, responsible for forming disulphide bonds in periplasmic proteins (Bardwell, 1994). We also 189 found rapA, important for recycling RNA polymerase (Sukhodolets et al., 2001), reduced 190 susceptibility to piperacillin and tazobactam, both separately and in combination when inactivated. 191 These findings suggest a reduction in transcription rate and translation fidelity may benefit survival 192 to a wide range of stresses. 193 194 We identified that DNA repair and replication reduces susceptibility to both piperacillin and 195 tazobactam, but not each drug separately. Increased expression of uspB involved in DNA 196 recombination repair, and mutT involved in maintaining DNA replication fidelity, were both 197 beneficial for survival in the presence of both drugs and not each drug separately (Figure 3). XseB, 198 encoding an exonuclease subunit involved in DNA repair, was essential to survival in the presence 199 of both drugs, where transposon mutants with an inactive copy of xseB could not be detected. This 200 suggests the combination of piperacillin and tazobactam elicits a DNA damage response from the 201 cell and genes involved in DNA repair confer increased fitness when exposed to both drugs, but 202 not either drug separately. This highlights the synergy between piperacillin and tazobactam 203 independent of \u03b2-lactamase inhibition. 204 205\n206\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Images are representative of two independent replicates. 210 211 212 A range of other genes in diverse pathways were also under selective pressure after exposure to 213\npiperacillin or tazobactam 214 Identification of genes known to affect piperacillin susceptibility confirms the efficacy of this 215 approach. Both mrcB and lpoB (both involved in peptidoglycan synthesis) were beneficial for 216 survival in piperacillin-exposed conditions. Mutations in genes involved in peptidoglycan synthesis 217 and re-modelling, including ldcA, mepS, nlpI, prc, slt and the Tol-Pal system, also demonstrated 218 increased susceptibility to piperacillin both with and without tazobactam, indicating that their 219 encoded functions are beneficial in the presence of piperacillin. The genes involved in the 220 synthesis and function of penicillin binding protein 1A, mrcA and lpoA, were only beneficial to 221 survival in conditions treated with the combination of both drugs, not each drug separately. This 222 demonstrates the different selective pressure on genes coding for cell wall functions when these 223 drugs are given in combination relative to separately. 224 225 We found mutations inactivating glutathione synthesis via gshA and gshB strongly reduced 226 tazobactam susceptibility. Glutathione has previously been linked to efflux activity (Song et al., 227 2021, Holden et al., 2023), so this further supports our hypothesis that tazobactam elicits a strong 228 efflux response in E. coli. 229 230 Multiple genes involved in Fe-S cluster synthesis and repair affected tazobactam susceptibility in 231 E. coli. TraDIS-Xpress found inactivation of hscA and hscB (Tokumoto and Takahashi, 2001) 232 reduced susceptibility and inactivation of iscS and its regulator iscR (Schwartz et al., 2001) 233 increased susceptibility. IscS also has a role in tRNA modification, however the genes downstream 234 in this pathway (tusA, tusBCD, mnmE, mnmG) (Ikeuchi et al., 2006) were found to have a negative 235 effect on survival in tazobactam-exposed conditions. Production of extracellular polysaccharides 236 was also beneficial for survival in piperacillin-exposed conditions. Genes involved in LPS 237 biosynthesis (wbbK, waaS, lpxL) and transport (lptA, lptB and lptC) and most of the operon 238 involved in enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) biosynthesis (wecA-wecG) were found to 239 positively affect survival in the presence of piperacillin. 240\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

We 243 found that tazobactam elicited a strong efflux response from a wide variety of efflux pump families, 244 their local and global regulators, as well as genes that affect global regulator activity. This was in 245 stark contrast to the much more limited efflux response elicited by piperacillin, which consisted of 246 only the AcrAB efflux pump and its local regulator AcrR. When cells were treated with a 247 combination of piperacillin and tazobactam, the global regulators MarA, SoxS and Rob and an 248 additional efflux pump AcrEF were beneficial for survival showing the selective impact of 249 tazobactam is maintained when combined with piperacillin. We also showed that tazobactam 250 readily selects for efflux mutants in E. coli and K. pneumoniae, two pathogens where efflux 251 mediated resistance is important. Mutations analogous to those we selected within efflux regulators 252 marR and soxR are well characterised and have previously been described to reduce susceptibility 253 to multiple antibiotics in pathogens (Piddock, 2006). Whilst efflux activity alone may only confer 254 modest reductions in susceptibility to antibiotics it synergises with other resistance mechanisms. 255 For example, E. coli that are resistant to fluoroquinolones through mutations in gyrA are rendered 256 susceptible by disrupting efflux activity (Kern et al., 2000, Oethinger et al., 2000). This 257 demonstrates that a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor which is used to nullify a resistance mechanism may in 258 fact be actively promoting the emergence of another multidrug resistance mechanism. Usage of 259 Piperacillin and Tazobactam is increasing rapidly (Cotteret et al., 2016, Drawz and Bonomo, 2010), 260 as is global antimicrobial resistance (O'Neill, 2014), so it is extremely important to understand how 261 the antibiotics we use may contribute to resistance. 262 263 Tazobactam has been well characterised as an inhibitor of \u03b2-lactamases but little previous work 264 has studied any other impacts on the bacterial cell. In addition to the evidence for tazobactam to be 265 selective for increased efflux, we also found a very strong signal for interaction with the shikimate 266 kinase AroK. This may suggest a direct interaction with tazobactam and AroK as insertional 267 inactivation of aroK considerably increased growth and survival of E. coli, and a SNP within aroK 268 was found in an E. coli mutant selected after exposure to piperacillin-tazobactam. Shikimate is a 269 precursor for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids, enterobactin, folate, ubiquinone and 270 menaquinone: it is possible that reduced synthesis of these compounds slows respiration, carbon 271 metabolism and therefore growth in order to become tolerant to tazobactam. However, we only see 272 a signal for aroK and not aroL with the same function, so it is unlikely that this is the mechanism 273 through which reduced tazobactam susceptibility is achieved. AroK has been previously implicated 274 in mecillinam resistance, where deletion reduced susceptibility independently of its shikimate 275 kinase activity suggesting interactions with \u03b2-lactams are possible (Vinella et al., 1996). It is 276 possible that AroK affects tazobactam susceptibility in the same manner. It is also possible that the 277 combination of reduced AroK activity and increased efflux activity is responsible for a significant 278\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

Further investigation into how tazobactam selects for 279 reduced susceptibility in strains without functional \u03b2-lactamases is crucial. If tazobactam can select 280 for loss of function of aroK, this could have implications for its susceptibility to mecillinam and other 281 \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. 282 283 As well as the impacts on efflux and aroK, we also found many other genes under selective 284 pressure from either tazobactam, piperacillin or the combination of the two. Previous work by 285 Val\u00e9ria dos Santos et al. (2010) characterised an E. coli isolate resistant to piperacillin and 286 tazobactam and found changes to a diverse group of proteins including upregulation of those in 287 membrane permeability and DNA stress response and a lower abundance of proteins involved in 288 respiration and translation. Our work also found genes involved in DNA replication and repair were 289 beneficial to survival in conditions exposed to both piperacillin and tazobactam, but not each drug 290 separately. This and previous work suggest the combination of both drugs induces DNA damage. 291 We also identified multiple genes involved in replication, transcription and translation affected 292 fitness when exposed to piperacillin and tazobactam. Mutations in genes coding for these functions 293 may slow or stop growth, resulting in increased tolerance to the antibiotics in a non-specific 294 manner as has been shown in previous studies (Brauner et al., 2016) 295 296 The demonstration here that tazobactam exerts a selective pressure has implications for how 297 future \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors are designed. It is extremely important to prevent selection for 298 multidrug resistance which could be an unintended correlate impact from tazobactam use. Multiple 299 novel \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor combinations are in development (Naas et al., 2017, Boyd et 300 al., 2020) and our work shows consideration of the selective impact of the inhibitor should not be 301 overlooked. It remains to be seen if other \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors will have significant selective 302 impacts of their own and this should be an important consideration for development of new 303 combinations which are urgently needed to counter the emergence of resistance. 304\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

(2020). Approximately 107 CFU/mL of 308 this library was added to 1 mL LB Miller broth in a 96-well deep-well plate and supplemented with 309 concentrations of piperacillin around the MIC (MIC was 4 \u00b5g/mL piperacillin, concentrations used 310 were \u00bcx, \u00bdx, 1x and 2x MIC). Tazobactam was either added or omitted from these conditions at a 311 concentration of 32 \u00b5g/mL. The Tn5 transposon used to create this library contains an outward-312 transcribing tac promoter, which was either induced with 0.2 or 1 \u00b5M IPTG or left uninduced. Each 313 condition was carried out in duplicate with two antibiotic-free controls. Cultures were grown for 24 314 hours at 37 C shaking and were centrifuged at 3000 x g for 10 minutes to pellet the cells. 315 316 TraDIS-Xpress nucleotide sequencing & Informatics 317 Genomic DNA was extracted from cell pellets following the protocol described by Trampari et al. 318 (2021) and quantified using a Qubit HS assay kit (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA was fragmented with 319 the MuSeek DNA fragment preparation kit (ThermoFisher) and purified using AMPure XP beads 320 (Beckman Coulter). DNA fragments were amplified by PCR using customised biotinylated 321 oligonucleotides of nucleotide sequence specific for hybridisation to one transposon end. 322 Biotinylated DNA fragments were then purified using activated beads from the Dynabeads\u00ae 323 kilobaseBINDER\u2122 kit (Invitrogen). Following this, the Dynabeads\u00ae with bound DNA fragments 324 were used as the template for a second PCR amplification step, using customised oligonucleotides 325 specific for hybridisation to one transposon end and oligonucleotides specific for the MuSeek 326 adapter nucleotide sequences. Dynabeads\u00ae were removed from the PCR reactions using a 327 magnetic stand. The resulting PCR products were purified and fragments of between 300-500 bp 328 in length were applied to a NextSeq 500 using a NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit v2.5 (75 Cycles) 329 (Illumina). 330 331 Output FastQ files from the NextSeq 500/550 were aligned to the E. coli BW25113 (CP009273) 332 reference genome using BioTraDIS (version 1.4.3) incorporating BWA (Barquist et al., 2016). Data 333 from conditions treated with different concentrations of IPTG were amalgamated to simplify the 334 data interpretation. The tradis_comparison.R command (part of the BioTraDIS toolkit) was used to 335 determine significant differences (p < 0.05, after correction for false discovery) in insertion 336 frequencies per gene between control and test conditions. Increased insertion mutations 5\u2019 to 337 genes, that likely signify genes where increased transcription conferred a selective advantage, 338 were identified visually using the Artemis genome browser (Carver et al., 2011). 339 340 Selection of drug-resistant mutants & SNP analysis 341\n(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

After 24 hours, 0.1 mL from each 344 condition was transferred into 5 mL fresh LB broth supplemented with piperacillin and tazobactam 345 at double the concentration of the previous condition. At each passage, 1 mL of culture was also 346 collected, pelleted, and stored at -70 C. Cultures were passaged every 24 hours until no growth 347 was detected in each condition and three independent replicates were performed for each 348 condition. The final passage with visible cell growth was diluted and spread on LB agar to grow 349 single colonies. Three single colonies from each condition were chosen to represent each final 350 population.
