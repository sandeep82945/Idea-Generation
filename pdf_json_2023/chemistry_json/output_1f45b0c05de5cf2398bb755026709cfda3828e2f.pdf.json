This indicated that TiO2 was composed of two different crystal forms, and rutile was the main component. In addition, the characteristic diffraction peak corresponding to NiTiO3 (PDF-ICDD 33-0960) appeared when NiO was doped with TiO2. With the gradual increase of NiO content, the intensity of characteristic diffraction peak of TiO2 gradually decreased, while that of NiTiO3 gradually increased. It indicated that NiO did not exist on the surface of TiO2 carrier in the form of nanoparticles, but reacted with some TiO2 to form NiTiO3 and was uniformly loaded on TiO2. Meanwhile, the characteristic diffraction peaks of NiTiO3 and TiO2 gradually migrated to the low angle direction with the increase of NiO content (Fig. 1(b) and (c)). This may be due to the lattice distortion of TiO2 caused by the existence of NiTiO3.21\nFig. 1(d) and (e) showed the eld emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) of 10% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalyst. It could be seen from the gure that the catalyst was agglomerated by about 70 nm nanoparticles to form a micron-sized structure. In addition, there were abundant sub-micron pores (with the size of 250\u2013800 nm) in the micron block particles, and the pores were interconnected. Combined with BET results, it could be seen that the Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalyst has both mesopores of about 2\u2013 20 nm and submicron pores of about 250\u2013800 nm. In other words, Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalyst had hierarchical porous structure.\nFig. 1(e), (f) and S2\u2013S4\u2020 showed the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images and element mapping images of TiO2 and 10% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalysts, respectively. According to the Fig. S2 and S3,\u2020 the TiO2 catalyst was composed of nanoparticles about 28\u201345 nm, and its lattice fringe spacing was 0.325 nm, corresponding to the (110) crystal plane of rutile TiO2.32\u201334 In addition, its element composition was also Ti and O elements, no other impurities appear. Corresponding to the results of TiO2, the particle size of 10%Ni\u2013Ti\u2013 Ox catalyst was about 20 nm, which indicated that the grain growth of TiO2 was inhibited due to the formation of NiTiO3. Combined with SEM and TEM data, it could be found that for the 10% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalyst, the nanoparticles at about 20 nm were rstly agglomerated into submicron bulk particles at 70\u2013 150 nm, and then submicron particles were agglomerated to form micron particles with hierarchical pore structure. Furthermore, the lattice fringe spacing of 10% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalyst were 0.35 nm and 0.325 nm, corresponding to (101) crystal plane of anatase TiO2 and (110) crystal plane of rutile TiO2, respectively.35,36 Finally, according to the Fig. S4,\u2020 it could be\nfound that Ni element was uniformly distributed in TiO2. Combined with XRD data, it was proved that NiTiO3 structure was formed in 10% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalyst.\nFig. S5\u2020 and Table 1 showed the nitrogen adsorption and desorption curves, pore size distribution and specic surface area of TiO2 and Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalysts. It could be seen that the nitrogen adsorption and desorption curves of all the six groups of catalysts have hysteresis loops, indicating that there were mesopores in the catalysts.37 Furthermore, it could be seen from the pore size distribution that aer a small amount of NiOwas doped, themost probable pore size of the catalyst was 3.8 nm, and its average pore size was also reduced. On the contrary, when the NiO content was increased, the average pore diameter and the most probable pore diameter were increased. However, the 5% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalyst had 30 m2 g\u22121 and the others had close values to the 5% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox."

            "text": "According to our previous studies, the hydroxyl group on the surface of metal oxide was one of the important reaction intermediates in the reforming reaction,38 so the inuence of acidity and alkalinity on the catalytic performance was extremely important. For Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalyst, TiO2 was the main component, and the coordination charge number of oxygen was \u22122/3. One Ni atom in NiO was coordinated with six O atom, so the net charge value on each Ni\u2013O bond was 1/3 \u2013 2/3 = \u22121/3. According to Tanabe rule, the surface of NiO doped with TiO2 was Br\u00f8nsted acid.39 In other words, the incorporation of NiO would increase the surface acidity of Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalyst. It could be seen from Fig. 2(a) that there were two ammonia desorption peaks of pure TiO2 at 87 \u00b0C and 309 \u00b0C, representing physical adsorption and weak acidity, respectively.40\u201342 With the increase of NiO content, the total acid quantity on the catalyst surface showed a trend of increasing rst and then decreasing (Fig. 2(b)). It indicated that the incorporation of NiO could indeed signicantly improve the acid quantity on the catalyst surface. Finally, by comparing the two groups of catalysts of 5% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox and 5% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox\u2013N, it could be found that nickel chloride as a precursor had higher acid quantity than nickel nitrate as a precursor, and its acid strength was also signicantly reduced, which was conducive to the improvement of catalytic activity of steam reforming for hydrogen production.\nNiO is a basic oxide, so the incorporation of NiO can also theoretically enhance the basic surface of the catalyst. It could be seen from Fig. 2(c) that TiO2 had two CO2 desorption peaks at 100 \u00b0C and 299 \u00b0C, representing the weak basic site and the\nFig. 2 (a) NH3-TPD profiles, (b) acid quantity, (c) CO2-TPD profiles, (d) basic quantity, (e) H2-TPR profiles, (f) H2 consumption of different catalysts.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

In addition, with the gradual increase of NiO content, the basic quantity on the catalyst surface increased from 11.2 mmol gcat. \u22121 of TiO2 to 38.2 mmol gcat. \u22121 of 15% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013 Ox. However, as the content of NiO continued to increase, the basic quantity on the catalyst surface began to decrease (Fig. 2(d)). It may be because the content of NiO was too high, so that the active site was gradually covered by coating. Finally, according to our previous research, carboxylic acid species may appear in the intermediate species of methanol reforming to hydrogen production, so the enhancement of catalyst surface basic may be benecial to the improvement of catalytic activity.\nRedox performance was one of the important factors affecting the hydrogen production performance of reforming, so six groups of catalysts were characterized by H2-TPR, and the results were shown in Fig. 2(e) and (f). It was seen that pure TiO2 had a hydrogen reduction peak at 538 \u00b0C, corresponding to the reduction of Ti4+\u2013O\u2013Ti4+.45\u201347 The reduction peak of Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox migrated to low temperature aer the addition of NiO and the hydrogen consumption of the catalyst increased linearly with the increase of NiO content (Fig. S6\u2020). Therefore, the hydrogen reduction peak at 485\u2013523 \u00b0C should correspond to the reduction of Ni2+\u2013O\u2013Ti4+. This indicated that NiTiO3 exhibited better redox performance than TiO2. The increase of hydrogen consumption also indicated that the catalyst surface had more hydroxyl groups, which was benecial to the catalytic reaction. Finally, with the increase of NiO content, the hydrogen consumption of the catalyst increased, but the hydrogen\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nreduction peak temperature also gradually increased. That was to say, the number of hydroxyl groups that could easily participate in the reaction was also gradually decreasing. Therefore, Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalyst had an optimal equilibrium point between redox performance and hydrogen consumption to achieve the best catalytic performance."

In addition, the peak intensity of Ni 2p gradually increased with the increase of NiO content. According to Fig. 3(b), O 1s could be divided into two peaks of 531 eV and 529.5 eV, corresponding to chemisorbed oxygen (Oa) and the lattice oxygen (Ob), respectively.48,49 According to the literature, chemisorbed oxygen was the most active oxygen in the catalytic reaction, so the increase of its concentration was conducive to the catalytic reaction.48,50 It could be found that the proportion of chemisorbed oxygen on the catalyst surface increased from 0.154 to 0.214 with the increase of NiO content. In other words, the incorporation of NiO could effectively promoted the increase of chemisorbed oxygen concentration, thus accelerating the reaction. This was consistent with the hydrogen consumption in H2-TPR results.\nFig. 3(c) showed Ti 2p peaks of TiO2 and Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalysts.

It indicated that the formation of NiTiO3 changed the chemical environment around TiO2. In addition, the decrease of Ti 2p peak intensity aer NiO doping was mainly due to the decrease of the relative content of TiO2 in the catalyst. Finally, it was seen from Table 2 that the concentration of Ti3+ ions gradually decreased with the incorporation of NiO. This may be due to the reaction of some Ti3+ ions with NiO to form NiTiO3, which converted to Ti4+ ions. Fig. 3(d) showed the Ni 2p spectra of TiO2 and Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalysts. Ni 2p was divided into satellite (879.5 eV and 861.5 eV) and Ni2+ (872.9 eV and 855.4 eV).52 Furthermore, the intensity of Ni 2p peak gradually increased due to the gradual increase of NiO content in the catalyst.

Finally, comparing the hydrogen selectivity of 5% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox and 5% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox\u2013N catalysts, it was found that 5% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalyst had lower acid strength and alkali strength, so its hydrogen selectivity was higher. This indicated that the acidity and alkalinity of the catalyst surface were also important parameters affecting the performance of methanol steam reforming for hydrogen production.\nFig. 4(b) and (c) showed CO selectivity and CO2 selectivity of TiO2 and Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalysts, respectively. Similar to the results of hydrogen selectivity, 10% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalyst had the highest CO selectivity (92.6%) at 500 \u00b0C, while the highest CO selectivity of pure TiO2 was only 16.1% at 450 \u00b0C. In addition, the CO selectivity of the six groups of catalysts reached the highest at about 450 \u00b0C or 500 \u00b0C, and then decreased with the increase of temperature. Correspondingly, except that the CO2 selectivity of TiO2 was always lower than 1.1%, that of the other ve groups of Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalysts increased slowly with the increase of temperature before 450 \u00b0C or 500 \u00b0C, but increased sharply in the temperature range of 450\u2013600 \u00b0C or 500\u2013600 \u00b0C. It was speculated that the methanol steam reforming reaction was dominated by CH3OH / H2 + CO below 500 \u00b0C and CH3OH + H2O / H2 + CO at 500\u2013600 \u00b0C.\nFig. S7\u2020 showed the CH4 selectivity of TiO2 and Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalysts. It was found that CH4 selectivity of TiO2 and 20% Ni\u2013 Ti\u2013Ox catalysts was relatively high, reaching 32.2% at 450 \u00b0C and 37.7% at 500 \u00b0C, respectively. Correspondingly, the CH4 selectivity of the optimal catalyst 10% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox was lower than 12.1% in the whole test temperature range of 350\u2013600 \u00b0C. Combined with the results of H2, CO and CO2 selectivity, it was speculated that there were many side reactions for pure TiO2 or Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalysts with excessive NiO doping. Accordingly, the optimal catalyst 10% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox had less side reaction. Finally, it was seen from Fig. 4(d) that the methanol conversion of 10% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalyst reached 88.4% at 400 \u00b0C, and that was higher than 92% at 450\u2013600 \u00b0C. As shown in Table 3, the catalytic performance of 10% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox was compared with that of other catalysts from the literature. It was veried that NiO/MoO3 had some degree of advantages from the aspects of initiation temperature (the temperature at which the H2 selectivity was higher than 50%), highest hydrogen selectivity. However, the initiation temperature was relatively high and needed to be optimized for subsequent experiments.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

It was seen from Fig. 5(a) that with the extension of methanol adsorption time, the main peaks represented hydroxyl group (3670 cm\u22121), methoxy species (CH3O*, 2984, 2897 and 1057 cm\n\u22121), gaseous formaldehyde (1760\u20131722 cm\u22121), formic acid species (HCOOad, 1615 and 1387 cm\u22121) and the n(OH) of molecular-adsorbed ethanol (1238 cm\u22121), respectively. The emergence of methoxy species, formaldehyde species and formic acid species indicated that the path of methanol reforming to hydrogen production was similar to that of our previous study.14 In other words, methanol was adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst to form adsorbed methanol, and then dehydrogenation to form formaldehyde species.

However, the presence of molecular-adsorbed ethanol indicated that the methoxy species of pure TiO2 also reacted with adsorbed methanol during the reaction, resulting in by-products. This was also why the H2 selectivity and CO2 selectivity of pure TiO2 were low, but the CO selectivity and CH4 selectivity were high.\nAs shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c), aer the adsorption of methanol for 10 min, the in situ infrared spectra did not change signicantly whether the water vapor was introduced or both water vapor and methanol were introduced. Only the peak intensity representing methoxy species was slightly enhanced. This was mainly because the H2 selectivity, CO selectivity, CO2 selectivity and CH4 selectivity were at a very low level at 400 \u00b0C. The peaks of all intermediate species decreased signicantly\ntalysts\nHighest H2 selectivity (%) Ref.\n99.9 This work 99.4 37 89.0 53 85.0 54 85.8 55 40.0 56 70.0 57 65.0 58\n(a) methanol adsorption at 400 \u00b0C, (b) H2O adsorption at 400 \u00b0C, (c) O at different temperatures.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 16342\u201316351 | 16347\nTable 4 Details of the bands and corresponding species\nBand (cm\u22121) Species Ref.\n3715\u20133670 Hydroxyl group 59 2984\u20132820, 1057 Methoxy species (CH3O*) 60 1760\u20131722 Gaseous formaldehyde 61 1703 v(CO) in HCOOHad 62 1615\u20131353 vas(COO) in HCOOad 63 1238 The n(OH) of molecular-adsorbed ethanol 64\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

It indicated that methoxy species, formaldehyde, formic acid species and molecular-adsorbed ethanol were involved in the reaction. According to the peak intensity and its variation, it was speculated that methoxy species and formic acid species were the main intermediate species of methanol steam reforming reaction over the TiO2 catalyst. Meanwhile, the hydroxyl group on the catalyst surface was gradually consumed again, indicating that the hydroxyl group was also an important intermediate of the reaction (Table 4).\nIn order to compare the reaction mechanism of pure TiO2 and Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalysts, 10% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalyst was selected for in situ infrared characterization. The results were shown in\nFig. 6 In situDRIFT spectra of 10% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalyst at different tempera (c) methanol reacted with H2O at 400 \u00b0C and (d) methanol reacted with\nFig. 7 Reaction mechanism diagram of Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalyst.\n16348 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 16342\u201316351\nFig. 6 and S9.\u2020 According to Fig. 6(a), aer methanol adsorption for 10 min, methoxy species (2919 and 2820 cm\u22121), formic acid species (1580 and 1467 cm\u22121), and formic acid adsorption species (HCOOHad, 1703 cm\n\u22121) that formed hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl groups on the surface of 10% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalyst appeared. Compared with the results of pure TiO2, gaseous formaldehyde and molecular-adsorbed ethanol did not appear in the spectrum of 10% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalyst, which was mainly because 10% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox had better redox performance and higher selectivity.\nSimilar to the results of pure TiO2, the spectrum of 10% Ni\u2013 Ti\u2013Ox did not change signicantly aer methanol was added for 10 min and water vapor was added (Fig. 6(b)). When water vapor and methanol were simultaneously introduced, the peak intensity of hydroxyl group, methoxy species and formic acid species gradually decreased with time (Fig. 6(c)). It could be speculated that these three intermediates were involved in the steam reforming reaction for hydrogen production. From Fig. 6(d) and S9,\u2020 the peak intensity of hydroxyl group, methoxy species and formic acid species gradually continued to decrease. Based on the results of in situ infrared diffuse reection characterization and catalytic activity, it could be found that there were two main reaction pathways for methanol steam reforming on the surface of 10% Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalyst (Fig. 7): (1)\ntures: (a) methanol adsorption at 400 \u00b0C, (b) H2O adsorption at 400 \u00b0C, H2O at different temperatures.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

According to XRD and TEM results, TiO2 in Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalyst could be divided into anatase TiO2 and rutile TiO2, and themain exposed crystal planes of anatase TiO2 and rutile TiO2 were (101) and (110), respectively. From Fig. 8(a)\u2013(c) and S10(a)\u2013(c),\u2020 the (101)\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\ncrystal plane of anatase TiO2 was cut and optimized. In order to compare the effect of the position of the methanol molecule on the adsorption energy, two methanol adsorption models (site 1 and site 2) were simulated. Correspondingly, two adsorption models of methanol molecules on the (110) crystal plane of rutile TiO2 were optimized (Fig. 8(d)\u2013(f) and S10(d)\u2013(f)\u2020). Comparing the adsorption energy of methanol molecules of the two TiO2 (Table 5), it could be found that rutile TiO2 may be easier to adsorb methanol molecules. That was to say, the presence of rutile TiO2 in the Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalyst was benecial to the adsorption and activation of methanol molecules.\nThe active component NiO in the Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalyst mainly existed in the form of NiTiO3, and its main exposed crystal plane was (104). Therefore, Fig. 8(h), (i), S10(h) and (i)\u2020mainly showed two adsorption models of methanol molecules on its (104) crystal face. It was found that the adsorption energy of NiTiO3 for methanol molecules was signicantly higher than that of TiO2. Combined with the results of H2-TPR, CO2-TPD and XPS, it could be found that the formation of NiTiO3 was more conducive to the adsorption and activation of methanol molecules. This was one of the reasons why the Ni\u2013Ti\u2013Ox catalyst exhibited excellent methanol steam reforming hydrogen production performance."
