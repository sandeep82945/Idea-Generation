    "abstractText": "Topological phononics offers numerous opportunities in manipulating elastic waves that can propagate in solids without being backscattered. Due to the lack of nanoscale imaging tools that aid the system design, however, acoustic topological metamaterials have been mostly demonstrated in macroscale systems operating at low (kilohertz to megahertz) frequencies. Here, we report the realization of gigahertz topological valley Hall effect in nanoelectromechanical AlN membranes. Propagation of elastic wave through phononic crystals is directly visualized by microwave microscopy with unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution. The valley Hall edge states, protected by band topology, are vividly seen in both realand momentum-space. The robust valley-polarized transport is evident from the wave transmission across local disorder and around sharp corners, as well as the power distribution into multiple edge channels. Our work paves the way to exploit topological physics in integrated acousto-electronic systems for classical and quantum information processing in the microwave regime.",

            "text": "Topological phononics offers numerous opportunities in manipulating elastic waves that can propagate in solids without being backscattered. Due to the lack of nanoscale imaging tools that aid the system design, however, acoustic topological metamaterials have been mostly demonstrated in macroscale systems operating at low (kilohertz to megahertz) frequencies. Here, we report the realization of gigahertz topological valley Hall effect in nanoelectromechanical AlN membranes. Propagation of elastic wave through phononic crystals is directly visualized by microwave microscopy with unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution. The valley Hall edge states, protected by band topology, are vividly seen in both real- and momentum-space. The robust valley-polarized transport is evident from the wave transmission across local disorder and around sharp corners, as well as the power distribution into multiple edge channels. Our work paves the way to exploit topological physics in integrated acousto-electronic systems for classical and quantum information processing in the microwave regime.\nwhich are protected by the global property of bulk energy bands and thus robust against local perturbations1-3. While originally developed for electron waves in condensed matter systems, topological band theory soon expanded into other wave systems, leading to the rapid advance of topological mechanics4,5, photonics6,7, and phononics8,9 in the past decade. In particular, transport through edge channels in topological phononic systems is protected from backscattering due to structural disorders, fabrication imperfections, and environmental changes10-20. As a result, the pursuit of artificial elastic structures with novel band topology is not only intellectually attractive but also technologically relevant, especially in configurations that are suitable for integrated circuit applications.\nThe realization of a topological phase of matter requires coordinated efforts in theoretical\ncalculation, experimental implementation, and systematic characterization. In electronic materials, this is achieved through first-principles calculations, material synthesis, macroscopic transport, momentum-space (k-space) mapping, and microscopic imaging2. The same design principle also applies to acoustic metamaterials8,9,21, whose elastic moduli or mass densities vary periodically on a scale comparable to the acoustic wavelength. To date, studies of topological phononic crystals PnCs have been limited to relatively low frequencies. In the kHz range, the sonic design can be implemented by periodic arrangement of centimeter-scale meta-molecules (rods, rings, prisms\u2026), and the local pressure field of the sound wave is measured by a microphone13-15,18. For structures operating in the MHz regime, the local displacement field of the elastic wave is usually detected by a scanning laser interferometer16,17,19,20. In contrast, topological PnCs are much less explored in the Ultra High Frequency (UHF, 0.3 \u2013 3 GHz) and Super High Frequency (SHF, 3 \u2013 30 GHz) bands that are of crucial importance for wireless communication22, sensing technology23, and universal quantum interconnects24. One major hurdle lies in the difficulty to probe phononic structures fabricated on monolithic substrates. Given the micrometer-scale GHz acoustic wavelength in solids, optical vibrometers16,17,19,20 with diffraction-limited spatial resolution (~ 1\nm) are not generally applicable in the UHF/SHF regime. The development of a nanoscale acoustoelectric probing technology is therefore highly desirable for the advance of GHz topological phononics.\nthe observation of robust valley-polarized edge states in suspended AlN phononic crystals. Using a newly developed technique of transmission-mode microwave impedance microscopy (TMIM)25,26, we visualize the wave pattern across gapped and gapless PnCs on microfabricated freestanding membranes. Edge transport channels are vividly seen at the interface between two domains with opposite valley Chern numbers and the band dispersion is consistent with reciprocalspace analysis using fast Fourier transform (FFT). We show that the edge transport is robust against local disorder at the domain wall and sharp corners in Z-shaped channels, highlighting its topological protection against backscattering events. Topology-protected wave steering is also achieved in a beam-splitter design. Our results represent the first successful demonstration of topologically nontrivial phases in integrated phononic circuits with an operation frequency in the microwave regime, which is promising for both classical information technology and quantum computation systems.\nphononic analogue of the valley Hall effect (VHE)27. Valley pseudospin28 labels the degenerate energy extrema in momentum space, whose topological nature stems from the nontrivial Berry curvature localized at these extremal points of the acoustic band structure. As depicted in Fig. 1a, snowflake-like29,30 regions are etched away from a freestanding AlN membrane31,32. The rhombic\nprimitive cell consists of two sublattice sites (equilateral triangles, radii of circumcircles r0  r) and linking bridges. Fig. 1b shows the calculated band structures using finite-element modeling (see Methods). The dependence of eigenfrequencies as a function of various dimensions of this\nsnowflake pattern is shown in Supplementary Information S1. When r = 0, the structure can be viewed as an acoustic analogue of graphene, with C6v symmetry (sixfold rotations about the snowflake center and mirror symmetry about the vertical planes containing a basis vector of the honeycomb lattice), resulting in time-reversal-symmetry-protected Dirac dispersion near the K and\nK points of the Brillouin zone. For r  0, the symmetry of the PnC reduces to C3v, and the broken inversion symmetry lifts the degeneracy at the Dirac point14,15,18,20,33-35. Fig. 1c shows the rdependent bandgaps, as well as the piezoelectricity induced electrical potential profiles at the band\nedges for r =  100 nm. The topological phase transition across r = 0 can be captured by an effective kp Hamiltonian14:\n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3e(\ud835\udc3e\u2032) = \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc37(\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc65\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udf05\ud835\udc66\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc66 + \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc37\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc67), (1)\nwhere \ud835\udc63D is the Dirac velocity, \ud835\udf05\ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc66,\ud835\udc67 the momentum deviation from the K (K) point, \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc66,\ud835\udc67 the Pauli matrices, and \ud835\udc5a the mass term introduced by the broken inversion symmetry. This massive Dirac Hamiltonian produces nontrivial Berry curvatures at the two valleys, each can be integrated into a topological charge, i.e., a valley Chern number CK(K) = \u00bd sgn(m). 14 Here sgn(m) refers to the sign of m. It should be noted that because of the large momentum separation between the\ninequivalent K and K valleys, intervalley scattering is often significantly suppressed. As is seen\nbelow, the quantization of CK(K), arising from mass inversion and the assumption of inhibited intervalley scattering, plays crucial roles in the emergence of gapless VHE edge states.\nThe design of our PnC is geometric in nature and fully compatible with standard\nnanofabrication processes31,32. The inset of Fig. 2a shows the nanoelectromechanical device fabricated on a freestanding 800-nm-thick c-axis polycrystalline AlN film. Future experiments could incorporate Sc-doped AlN thin films36 that will further improve the electromechanical coupling. We emphasize that, in comparison with a prior work16, the relatively thick and stiff film and the small dimension of the triangular artificial atoms are crucial for the realization of GHz characteristic frequencies. The PnC is patterned by electron-beam lithography and plasma etching. The interdigital transducers (IDTs) used to excite acoustic waves in the film are formed by depositing 45-nm-thick Al on the piezoelectric AlN. Visualization of the GHz acoustic waves is performed by TMIM on an atomic-force microscope (AFM) platform25,26. All measurements are\nlaunched by the emitter IDT. The shielded cantilever probe37 behaves as a microwave receiver to\npick up the ~ 1 GHz piezoelectric potential. Through the 50- impedance-match section, the signal is amplified and demodulated by an in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) mixer, using the same microwave source that drives the emitter IDT. The signals at the RF and LO ports of the mixer can be expressed as \ud835\udc49RF \u221d \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc56(\ud835\udf14\ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc65) and \ud835\udc49LO \u221d \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc56(\ud835\udf14\ud835\udc61+\ud835\udf03) , where \ud835\udf14 is the angular frequency, \ud835\udc58 the acoustic wave vector, and \ud835\udf03 the mixer phase, respectively. The two output channels are therefore \ud835\udc49Ch1 \u221d Re(\ud835\udc49RF\ud835\udc49LO \u2217 ) = cos(\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udf03) and \ud835\udc49Ch2 \u221d Im(\ud835\udc49RF\ud835\udc49LO \u2217 ) = \u2212sin(\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udf03). The complexvalued TMIM signal \ud835\udc49Ch1 + \ud835\udc56 \u2217 \ud835\udc49Ch2 provides a phase-sensitive measurement on the local displacement field of the elastic wave. For simplicity, we will only present one channel below unless otherwise specified. The unique properties of the TMIM setup include (1) high sensitivity (10 ~ 100 fm)38 superior to that of commercial laser-based scanning vibrometers (~ 1 pm)39, (2) outstanding spatial resolution (10 ~ 100 nm) well into the nanoscale, and (3) high operation frequency up to 10 GHz and beyond26, making it an ideal technique to study integrated UHF/SHF phononic metamaterials.\nWe begin by characterizing the gap opening due to broken space-inversion symmetry. As\nillustrated in Fig. 2a, the PnC region is tilted from the normal of the plane wave launched by the IDT. Conservation of momentum parallel to the PnC boundary14 requires that k|| = k0 sin , where k|| is the projection of K (or K) on the boundary, k0 the wavevector for the pattern-free AlN membrane, and  the tilt angle. As shown in Supplementary Information S2, this angular selection\nrule is satisfied at 1 = 23 (see Figs. 3 \u2013 5) and 2 = 55 (see Fig. 2). In Figs. 2b and 2c, we plot the transmission spectra taken by a vector network analyzer on the gapless and gapped structures, respectively. Within the IDT passband (1.00 \u2013 1.06 GHz), the transmission coefficient (S21) of the gapless PnC is substantially higher (~ 30 dB) than that of the gapped PnC. The residual wave\ntransmission in the gapped PnC is consistent with tunneling across the finite-sized (50 m) crystal via an evanescent mode. The corresponding TMIM images at 1.045 GHz are shown in Figs. 2d\nand 2e. For the design with r = 0, the gapless nature is evident from the appearance of transmitted\nplane waves on the opposite side of the PnC. In contrast, for the gapped structure with r = 100 nm, the PnC region in the TMIM image (Fig. 2e) only displays the snowflake patterns due to topographic crosstalk (Supplementary Information S3), and the transmitted wave on the far side\nTMIM image inside the gapless PnC and the potential profile simulated by finite-element modeling. The resemblance between the two images confirms that the TMIM indeed measures the piezoelectric surface potential, which is proportional to the acoustic displacement field on the AlN membrane.\norange arrows point to the VHE states. i, Measured FFT amplitude along KK from 1 GHz to 1.06 GHz. The blue, green and red curves are extracted from the profiles indicate by the horizontal lines of corresponding colors in (d, f, h). The peak positions of the edge and bulk states are marked by orange and gray dots, respectively. j, Simulated bands of the PnC projected in the kx direction, showing the VHE band running across the bulk gap. The horizontal lines indicate the three representative frequencies of corresponding colors in i. The VHE edge state is colored in orange. Scale bars are 5 m in (a), 20 m in (b, e, g), and 2  0.05 m-1 in (d, f, h).\nHaving confirmed the symmetry-induced gap opening in our metamaterial design, we now\nmove on to study the VHE edge states. Fig. 3a displays a scanning electron microscopy (SEM)\nimage around the interface separating two domains with r = +100 nm (top) and \u2212100 nm (bottom).\nSince the difference in the topological charge between the two domains is quantized, i.e., |CK| = 1, a chiral valley-Hall edge mode must exist at the boundary due to the bulk-edge correspondence14. Fig. 3b shows the real-space TMIM image at the upper bound of the IDT passband (f = 1.060 GHz), where a weak channel carrying elastic waves is observed (full data in Supplementary Information S4). The k-space information can be obtained by taking FFT of the signal \ud835\udc49Ch1 + \ud835\udc56 \u2217 \ud835\udc49Ch2. Using the extended Brillouin zone of the honeycomb lattice (Fig. 3c) as a guide, we can discern a faint high-intensity line on the left side of the K point (Fig. 3d). At f = 1.045 GHz (Fig. 3e), which coincides with the frequency at the K point in reciprocal space, the VHE edge state is fully resolved as the frequency is well within the IDT band. Correspondingly, the FFT map in Fig. 3f exhibits very strong intensity at the K point. According to the Bloch\u2019s theorem40, the wavefunction of the edge state satisfies \ud835\udf13?\u20d7? (\ud835\udc5f ) = \ud835\udc62?\u20d7? (\ud835\udc5f )\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc56?\u20d7? \u2219\ud835\udc5f , where \ud835\udc62?\u20d7? (\ud835\udc5f ) is a function with the lattice periodicity. At the K point, where |kx| = 2/3a0, one should expect a period of 3a0 in the wavefunction, i.e., \ud835\udf13\ud835\udc3e(\ud835\udc65 + 3\ud835\udc4e0) = \ud835\udf13\ud835\udc3e(\ud835\udc65), which is indeed observed in Fig. 3e. We emphasize that the weak intensity at the K valley in Fig. 3f is not due to intervalley scattering. Rather, it is associated with the inevitable reflection due to the impedance mismatch at the junction between the PnC region and the unpatterned region, which leads to wave propagation in the opposite direction (Supplementary Information S5). At f = 1.010 GHz, the frequency lies inside the bulk band such that both bulk and edge states are present (Fig. 3g). The k-space map in Fig. 3h also shows a high-intensity line on the right side of the K point, which is associated with the VHE state, and some intensity around the K point, which indicates the appearance of bulk states.\nand the calculated band structure. In the real space, the VHE edge state is a gapless mode localized\nat the interface and travels along opposite directions near K and K valleys because of the opposite group velocity, manifesting the momentum-valley locking of the chiral edge states. The group\nvelocity is characterized by the band dispersion as d/dk. In Fig. 3i, we display the FFT line\nprofiles along the KK direction and highlight the three representative frequencies shown in Figs. 3b-3h. The dispersion of both the bulk and topological edge states is clearly seen as we track the position of FFT peak intensity. This is in excellent agreement with the simulated curves in Fig. 3j, where the simulated bands projected in the kx direction are plotted. Here a single band appears around the K valley and runs monotonically across the bulk bandgap of 1.015 \u2013 1.080 GHz.\ncrystals. Schematics are shown to the left of the images. Substantial reflection and attenuation are evident for these topologically trivial interfaces. The false-color scale for all TMIM images is from \u221250 mV to 50 mV. All scale bars are 20 m.\nUsing the same topological design, we can also demonstrate the robustness of VHE edge\nstate transport against structural imperfections. Fig. 4a illustrates the schematic of a different PnC sample with one defect (three missing snowflakes) at the domain boundary13. As seen in Fig. 4b, while the signal strengths in both channels are altered by the scatterer, the TMIM modulus\n(\u221a\ud835\udc49Ch1 2 + \ud835\udc49Ch2 2 ) remains unchanged after crossing the local disorder. In other words, the scattering\ncenter modifies the phase but not the amplitude of the elastic wave propagating along the topological interface. Similarly, the topological protection of valley transport is also validated by transmission with negligible loss through sharp corners of a zigzag interface14, as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 4c. At the unit cell level, the relative position of the two valley Hall domains is invariant with respect to the interface. As a result, the forward-moving modes are always projected to the same valley and protected from backscattering by the band topology. As shown in the TMIM image (Fig. 4c), the incident elastic wave is guided into the domain wall and propagates freely through the two sharp turns. The absence of wave attenuation across the corners is evident from the TMIM signal profiles at three representative locations (lower right inset). The exponential decay (\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udf09\u2044 ) of the wavefunction into gapped PnC regions indicates that the VHE state is indeed\nlocalized at the topological interface, with  ~ 6 m comparable to the lattice constant. For comparison, we design and measure two topologically trivial Z-shaped channels \u2013 one pattern-free waveguide (Fig. 4d) and one gapless waveguide (Fig. 4e) \u2013 within gapped PnCs. In both cases, the\nfirst 120-turn already introduces substantial reflection and strong disturbance to the incident wave. The attenuation after two bending corners is so significant that little energy is transmitted to the output port. The topological protection is thus crucial for guiding elastic waves with minimal loss in nanoelectromechanical systems.\nFinally, we demonstrate the realization of a VHE-based topological beam splitter33,41. Fig.\n5a shows the TMIM modulus image as an elastic wave enters a meta-structure with four alternating valley Hall domains (schematic in the upper right inset). The incident wave splits into two branches\nseparated by an angle of 120. On the other hand, the appearance of propagating wave along the\njunction, which is prohibited by the VHE. In the experiment, wave transmission in the forward direction beyond the intersection is indeed negligible, with a suppression factor of over 40 dB. Interestingly, a careful examination of the crystal design (lower right inset of Fig. 5a) indicates that the upper branch is closer to the input line than the lower branch by 0.5a0. This subtle asymmetry is readily captured by the sensitive TMIM imaging. In Fig. 5b, we plot the square of TMIM modulus integrated over one wavelength (\u222b (\ud835\udc49Ch1 2 + \ud835\udc49Ch2\n2 )\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc4e0 ), which is proportional to\nthe acoustic power, for all four segments. The lower branch receives less (~ 40%) acoustic energy than the upper branch (~ 60%) from the incident wave, which is consistent with the uneven beam splitting inherent in the metamaterial design.\nThe GHz topological VHE demonstrated in this work may be exploited for integrated\nphononic circuits in the UHF/SHF regime. The acoustic beam splitter in Fig. 5a, for instance, can be used as power dividers or combiners. The zigzag VHE edge channels in Fig. 4c allows robust\nthe valley-momentum locking property will enable us to implement valley filters. Here the gapless\nstate (r = 0) is used as the background PnC, where the valley degree of freedom is well defined. In this \u201cacoustic graphene\u201d, both \ud835\udc3e and \ud835\udc3e\u2032 valley-polarized states can propagate in all directions allowed by the crystal symmetry. One can then construct a topological VHE region (similar to Fig. 3a) to select a specific valley state. After certain circuit operations, the valley information can be read out by passing it through a second VHE region that has either the same or opposite valley polarity. All these circuit elements are promising candidates for classical and quantum information applications.\nIn summary, we have designed and fabricated GHz nanoelectromechanical phononic\ncrystals with topologically nontrivial structures. Using microwave impedance microscopy, we successfully visualize the elastic wave on patterned piezoelectric AlN membranes with unprecedented displacement sensitivity and spatial resolution. The topologically protected edge states between two gapped structures with opposite valley Chern numbers are demonstrated in both real-space imaging and momentum-space analysis. The valley Hall effect protected against backscattering is evident from the negligible loss through local disorders and sharp corners, as well as the power splitting into multiple edge channels. Our work provides an excellent framework to exploit integrated topological phononics for classical and quantum information processing in the microwave regime."
