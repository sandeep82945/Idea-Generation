            "text": "In accordance with conditions of the post-financial and economic crisis and the difficult political situation in Ukraine, the investment activity of domestic business entities does not ensure the proper productivity and efficiency of production, which does not contribute to the stabilization of the economic development of the country in the future. This necessitates the adoption of effective management decisions regarding to the organization of investment activities of enterprises in order to obtain high financial results and increasing competitiveness. Understanding the processes of transformation of the investment activity of domestic business entities is decisive, when making decisions and forming effective scenarios for the further development of business activities aimed at increasing profits. In addition, it is also important to identify the main factors that have the most impact on the profitability of the enterprise and to identify and evaluate the relationship between them.\nThere are complex economic realities for the development of production today, so, the economic agents are faced with the task of finding the optimal ratio between investments in the production restructuring processes and investments in innovative projects. Usually, these two areas of investment activity are interconnected and complement each other. On the one hand, investments in repairs and equipment, modernization of management and sales systems enable the business entity to maintain its position in a competitive market environment and create conditions for the accumulation of financial sources. However, on the other hand, they do not contribute to the generation of long-term competitive advantages, as they do not ensure the stability of its market position in the long term. This problem can be solved only by forming the optimal structure of their own capital investments.\nEffective management decisions in the field of investment policy organization will always be a priority among tasks related to the stabilization of the country's economic development at both levels: as for the state, so for the business entities.\nThere are some studies on the investment activities of enterprises. Pi\u0105tkowski, M.J. (2020) analyzed the investment activity of Polish enterprises for 2007\u20132015, as in terms of their sizes and types, so at the regional level. He got the conclusion that the cost of fixed assets remains low despite the growing investment volumes of Polish enterprises compared to the other EU countries\u2019 enterprises. He also revealed the existence of large regional differences in the level of growth per capita of the working-age population and in the level of the growth in the value of investments among private businesses. In another study, Pi\u0105tkowski, M.J. (2020) analyzed the results of material investments in enterprises of the Lesser Poland Voivodeship, in two groups of subjects, that is those who implemented investments at the expense of EU subsidies, and those who financed investments from other sources without using EU assistance. The author used a descriptive approach combined with statistical analysis. The multiple linear regression (MLR) model was used to test the hypotheses. J\u0119drzejczak-Gas, J. et al (2018) conducted a comparative study of Polish companies operating in different\nACCESS Journal: Access to Science, Business, Innovation in Digital Economy\nISSN 2683-1007 (Online)\n2023, 4(1), 7-23, https://doi.org/10.46656/access.2023.4.1(1) https://journal.access-bg.org/\nindustries using linear ordering methods (sum method and Helwig method). They found high fluctuations in investment activity in 2010\u20132016 and attributed this to the uncertainty Polish companies were faced during the period under study.\nWildowicz-Giegel, A. (2013) notes that investments in intangible assets enable businesses as to maintain, so to improve their competitive positions in the long term. Analyzing the investment activity of Polish enterprises, she paid special attention to the amount and structure of investments in tangible and intangible assets and concluded that not only the investment activity of business entities is low compared to the EU-27 countries, but also insufficient from the point of view of the needs of the Polish economy. \u010c\u00e1msk\u00e1, D. et al (2011, 2012) researched investment activity in the Czech Republic during 2008\u20132011 deduced that financial support programs can become an additional source of investment financing.\nThe purpose of this study is to identify the main trends in the investment activity of domestic enterprises using a comprehensive analysis of the structural dynamics of real investment projects and its impact on their financial results."

            "text": "Since the assessment of the effectiveness of the investment policy in relation to enterprises involves the analysis of current and past results of investment activities, we consider the dynamics of the formation of the capital investment of domestic enterprises as a whole and so as by type of economic activity with a breakdown on large, medium and small (the latter also include microenterprises).\nStatistical data of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine, which are presented in the national currency (UAH), were used in the research. However, taking into account the research period (2010\u20132020), namely the fact that in 2014 Russia\u2019s armed aggression against Ukraine was began, which caused a sharp devaluation of UAH (Figure 1), we did a recalculation of the main indicators that were used in analysis, from the national currency to the official currency of the European Union countries (the latter was chosen based on the fact that\nACCESS Journal: Access to Science, Business, Innovation in Digital Economy\nISSN 2683-1007 (Online)\n2023, 4(1), 7-23, https://doi.org/10.46656/access.2023.4.1(1) https://journal.access-bg.org/\ntoday Ukraine is a candidate for joining the EU). This made it possible to avoid false conclusions, since when considering the dynamics of indicators in UAH, only the growth of capital investments is observed and the real situation in the field of investment activity is not reflected. The conversion of measurement units from the national currency to the EUR was carried out according to the official exchange rate (average for the period), calculated on the basis of the data of Ukraine National Bank (2020), which were set for the EUR during the corresponding year.\nAs can be seen on Figure 1 large-scale drop in UAH exchange rate during 2014\u20132016 became a stress for the country\u2019s economy; this made adjustments in most spheres of economic life, in particular, certain transformations took place in the sphere of investment activity. Therefore, it is not rational to talk about the increase of capital investments in UAH without taking into account the interaction of the national and world economies.\nAt the beginning of research, before detecting dynamic investment structure transformations of domestic enterprises, we considered the change in the indicator that are characterized the total volume of capital investments in entrepreneurial activity in dynamics during the studied period. For the analysis we used statistical data that were provided on the official website of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine regarding capital investments of enterprises by type of economic activity with a breakdown on large, medium, small and microenterprises in 2010\u20132020 (the latter two are combined into one group). In order to confirm the feasibility conversion of the national currency into EUR for further calculations, we demonstrated an infographic of the difference between the dynamic series of this indicator depending on the currency in which it is expressed (Figure 2 (a, b)).\nACCESS Journal: Access to Science, Business, Innovation in Digital Economy\nISSN 2683-1007 (Online)\n2023, 4(1), 7-23, https://doi.org/10.46656/access.2023.4.1(1) https://journal.access-bg.org/\nAccording to Figure 2 the volume of capital investments in UAH increases during the studied period of time, and a sharp increase is observed precisely with the beginning of Russia\u2019s armed aggression against Ukraine; but real situation in the investment sphere become more understandable after analyzing the capital investments of domestic enterprises in EUR, namely, taking into account political events we can see the decrease in the volume of investments and their gradual growth during the period of adaptation of the domestic economy to new realities against the background of the country\u2019s struggle for territorial integrity.\nIt is also important to analyze the dynamics of the financial results of the functioning of enterprises with their division into large, medium, small and micro (Table 1) because of the implementation of effective investment activity is primarily aimed at increasing the company\u2019s profit, increasing the cost of capital and/or obtaining other benefits for investors,\nData of Table 1 demonstrate us that despite the superiority of profitable enterprises of Ukraine over lossmaking ones in number (they are correlated as 2:1, and sometimes 3:1, respectively, in each of the groups), the overall resulting indicator of their financial activity is presented with a negative sign, which indicates the advantage of the unprofitability of a relatively small part of economic agents over the profitability of others.\nACCESS Journal: Access to Science, Business, Innovation in Digital Economy\nISSN 2683-1007 (Online)\n2023, 4(1), 7-23, https://doi.org/10.46656/access.2023.4.1(1) https://journal.access-bg.org/\n2015 423 55,7 105387895,0 44,3 250791766,1 2016 383 65,8 158665892,0 34,2 97443205,0 2017 399 73,3 266879072,0 26,7 109972776,0 2018 446 76,9 277607658,8 23,1 102431494,0 2019 518 78,4 336446436,1 21,6 104425962,4 2020 512 69,3 244892012,5 30,7 182936600,4\nMedium enterprises 2010 20983 63,4 87592330,6 36,6 46010660,4\n2011 20753 66,3 87526739,5 33,7 56436042,2 2012 20189 66,2 111313201,3 33,8 63571191,9 2013 18859 65,0 81498827,4 35,0 73108757,5 2014 15906 62,6 103427946,8 37,4 302608302,5 2015 15203 71,1 186781418,8 28,9 277943240,1 2016 14832 76,1 177033687,9 23,9 144217155,5 2017 14937 76,6 208842546,8 23,4 118071953,6 2018 16057 78,2 251823440,4 21,8 104658158,1 2019 17751 77,9 356527463,6 22,1 79332430,6 2020 17602 76,5 273619609,1 23,5 188553885,9\nSmall and microenterprises 2010 357241 58,6 27770042,0 41,4 43417107,9\n2011 354283 65,0 36975655,8 35,0 42032915,5 2012 344048 64,4 39794131,4 35,6 49048118,7 2013 373809 66,0 39640861,7 34,0 64698765,2 2014 324598 66,5 49156077,9 33,5 224418474,8 2015 327814 73,9 95482992,3 26,1 207388949,0 2016 291154 73,3 107312542,0 26,7 131463954,1 2017 322920 72,7 117446532,1 27,3 128171349,9 2018 339374 74,1 139462397,6 25,9 92591583,0 2019 362328 73,7 176668204,9 26,3 72839676,1 2020 355708 71,1 155467187,0 28,9 167754009,2\nSource: Author\u2019s own calculation by using MS Excel.\nThe dynamics of the indicator characterizing the profit / loss of Ukrainian enterprises with a breakdown on large, medium, small and microenterprises in 2010\u20132020 also is quite illustrative (Figure 3).

Among them we can single out the two largest types in each group of enterprises, the shares values which range from 0.4 to 0.5, that are gross investment in machines and equipment and gross investment in construction and alteration of buildings gross investment in construction and alteration of buildings; the other four types of capital investment have significantly lower values.\nTaking into account the breakdown domestic enterprises on large, medium, small and micro, let's depict\nthe dynamics of capital investment shares in studied period on Figure 4.\nAccording to figure 4, we can see that the share of capital investment in machines and equipment in the\noverall structure is growing significantly for all three group of enterprises after 2014. Based on the results of the analysis, it can be stated that in 2014 there were structural deformations in the investment activity of all groups of enterprises. It took domestic enterprises a year or two to overcome its and enter a different structural regime, moreover, this process was accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of enterprises. Another factor in the structural recession of the investment activity of domestic enterprises was the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\nACCESS Journal: Access to Science, Business, Innovation in Digital Economy\nISSN 2683-1007 (Online)\n2023, 4(1), 7-23, https://doi.org/10.46656/access.2023.4.1(1) https://journal.access-bg.org/\nThus, it follows that the situations in both 2014 and 2020 are not natural, but caused a significant reduction in the volume of capital investments in business activities, the number of enterprises of all groups and had some impact on the profitability of business entities.\nIn order to analyze impact of individual components of capital investments on the financial result indicator, to find out whether there is a dependence between them and to highlight the most important factors, we used multivariate regression analysis. This method is the most common and simplest for establishing the relationship between dependent and independent variables; it is used to analyze various economic phenomena and processes, Dziubanovska N., (2019). In addition, constructing the linear regression model can be the initial stage of data analysis.\nSo, before using multifactor regression modeling, we define Y as a dependent variable \u2013 profit / loss of Ukrainian enterprises, billion EUR; and we evaluate the dependence of this indicator on six types of capital investments: gross investment in machines and equipment, thsd. EUR (X1); gross investment in land, thsd. EUR (X2); gross investment in existing buildings and structures, thsd. EUR (X3); gross investment in construction and alteration of buildings, thsd. EUR (X4); gross investment in concessions, patents, licences, trade marks and similar rights, thsd. EUR (X5); gross investment in purchased software, thsd. EUR (X6). For analysis the data from the State Statistics Service of Ukraine in 2010\u20132020 were used (excluding the temporarily occupied territory of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, the city of Sevastopol, and part of the temporarily occupied territories in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions).\nMultifactor regression analysis was carried out using the Multiple Regression module of the STATISTICA 10 software product. At the first stage, we analyzed the impact of capital investments by type on the financial results of business entities of Ukraine as a whole, without a breakdown on groups. The main indicators of the regression model are presented on Figure 5.\nAs we can see for the modeling results, the coefficient of determination from the table of parameters of the multiple regression equation (Figure 6) also shows that some of the coefficients are not statistically significant ( tablecalculated tt  ).\nACCESS Journal: Access to Science, Business, Innovation in Digital Economy\nISSN 2683-1007 (Online)\n2023, 4(1), 7-23, https://doi.org/10.46656/access.2023.4.1(1) https://journal.access-bg.org/\nTherefore, the next stage of the regression analysis is to select such determinants that have a strong impact on the investigated feature. To do this, we applied stepwise analysis, which consists in sequentially excluding or including factors from the model based on certain criteria. As a result, we will get the regression equation\nof the species ( .70766345.02 R ):\n641 98388.019441.179741.09480283 XXXY  . (1)\nAdequacy of the model was confirmed by analysis of residuals. The more the distribution is similar to the normal one, the better the values of the residuals lie on a straight line, as evidenced by the normal probability graph of the residuals for the constructed model (Figure 7).\nACCESS Journal: Access to Science, Business, Innovation in Digital Economy\nISSN 2683-1007 (Online)\n2023, 4(1), 7-23, https://doi.org/10.46656/access.2023.4.1(1) https://journal.access-bg.org/\nOn next step the dependence of profitability / loss of Ukrainian enterprises on capital investments was considered more detail in each of the groups of economic entities. So, similarly, with the using STATISTICA 10 tools, we obtained three multivariate regression models.\nThus, large enterprises ( .85000535.02 R ):\n643 854895.0737240.0627479.019782833 XXXY  . (2)\nMedium enterprises ( 95317954,02 R ):\n531 56975.102436.192588.015064698 XXXY  . (3)\nSmall and microenterprises ( 95253293,02 R ):\n63 16196.120765.113148195 XXY  . (4)\nTherefore, as a result of a step-by-step multifactorial regression analysis, we obtained econometric models for evaluating the impact of certain types of capital investments on the indicator of financial performance of Ukrainian enterprises, having previously rejected factors which impact is not significant on the investigated characteristic. So, according to the results of modeling, the profit/loss of domestic business entities is most affected by gross investment in existing buildings and structures, thsd. EUR (X3), gross investment in construction and alteration of buildings, thsd. EUR (X4) and gross investment in purchased software, thsd. EUR (X6).\nThe last component is the component of capital investment into intangible assets, Corrado et al. (2005, 2009), which at the current stage are recognized in the EU as a key factor in increasing the efficiency and competitiveness of firms in the conditions of the penetration of information technologies, the creation of a single world market without national barriers, and the growing interdependence of national economies. As regards to investments in information technology, Demirhan, D. et al (2005/2006) pointed out that they have become crucial for companies to improve the quality of their products and services. Research results indicated a significant contribution of investments into intangible assets to the economic growth of countries. In particular, Fukao et al. (2009) noted that investment into intangible assets in Japan was 11.2% of GDP, in European countries this indicator was somewhat lower: 9.0% in Sweden (Edquist, 2011), 7.0% in Germany (Crass et al ., 2010), 6-7% in France (Delbecque & Nayman, 2010), 5.2% in Spain and Italy (Hao et al., 2009). According to studying at the level of economic sectors, Goodrige et al. (2012) provided evidence that the ratio of intangible investment to value added was the highest in the UK manufacturing sector.\nConsidering the above, investment into intangible assets, in particular, in software, is a promising direction of capital investments of domestic business entities. Computer technologies contribute to the integration of many areas and sectors of the modern complex systems functioning that evolve in conditions of instability,\nACCESS Journal: Access to Science, Business, Innovation in Digital Economy\nISSN 2683-1007 (Online)\n2023, 4(1), 7-23, https://doi.org/10.46656/access.2023.4.1(1) https://journal.access-bg.org/\ncrises and non-linearity. They provide an opportunity to develop models of optimal management of man-made objects, Ramazanov, S. et al. (2019) and create effective decision-making systems.\nTaking into account the lack of data on the volume of investments in the purchase of software in terms of types of economic activity, we analyzed the impact of the use of high technologies in the production activities of Ukrainian enterprises on their financial results. One of the methods for solving this problem is canonical correlation analysis. Regarding its utility, Opic (2019) noted that it enables the identification of latent correlation factors, i.e. models through canonical functions.\nWe applied this method for studying the impact of the using of high technologies in production on the profitability of Ukrainian enterprises. For analysis the data from the State Statistics Service of Ukraine in 2010\u20132020 were used.\nA set of dependent variables Y is Y1 \u2013 net profit (loss) of Ukrainian enterprises, thsd. EUR, and Y2 \u2013 volume of products sold by enterprises using high technologies in production, thsd. EUR. A set of variables X is X1 \u2013 gross investment in purchased software, thsd. EUR, and X2 \u2013 number of enterprises that using high technologies in production, units (Table 3).\n2211 XXV   , so that the correlation between U and V is maximum. The values of U and V, as well as their coefficients are called canonical. The closeness of the relationship between the canonical quantities is determined by the canonical correlation coefficient R.\nCanonical correlation analysis will be performed using the software product STATISTICA 10 (Figure 8). As a result of canonical correlation analysis, we obtained two canonical roots with the canonical value of the correlation coefficient R = 0.85395, which is quite large and highly significant, since p < 0.005. This value\nACCESS Journal: Access to Science, Business, Innovation in Digital Economy\nISSN 2683-1007 (Online)\n2023, 4(1), 7-23, https://doi.org/10.46656/access.2023.4.1(1) https://journal.access-bg.org/\nshows the closeness of the relationship between the canonical variables in the first and second plurals. Two roots describe 100% variance of the set of indicators of activity of the enterprises of Ukraine and 100% \u2013 set of the indicators characterizing attraction of investments in the acquisition of software and use by the enterprises of high technologies in their production activity.\nUsing the values of the volume of products sold by enterprises using high technologies in production and their net profit and canonical roots, we can explain, on average, 60.8% variance of variables in the left set and 59.7% variability in the right set. These results indicate a fairly strong relationship between the variables of the two sets.\nThe significance of the canonical roots is checked using the correlation coefficient and the fulfillment of\nthe condition p < 0.005 (Figure 9).\nAs it can be seen from Figure 9, the largest value is R = 0.853948 and it is the most significant, (p < 0.005) i.e. only the first canonical root is significant. The second canonical root is not significant, since the p-level = 0.2.\nTo calculate the values of canonical variables the canonical weights are used as of the left (Figure 10) and\nright (Figure 11) sets, respectively.\nACCESS Journal: Access to Science, Business, Innovation in Digital Economy\nISSN 2683-1007 (Online)\n2023, 4(1), 7-23, https://doi.org/10.46656/access.2023.4.1(1) https://journal.access-bg.org/\nBased on Figure 10 and Figure 11, we can make the equation of the canonical model for the variables U\nand V (R = 0.85):\n21 78186.072898.0 YYU  ; (5) 21 94167.064169.0 XXV  . (6)\nSince the correlation coefficient is quite weighty, it means that there is a close relationship between linear combinations of output variables, i.e. indicators of sales of Ukrainian enterprises and their net profit are significantly related to the studied factors.\nThe relationship between the values of the canonical variables from the right and left sets is represented\ngraphically (Figure 12).\nACCESS Journal: Access to Science, Business, Innovation in Digital Economy\nISSN 2683-1007 (Online)\n2023, 4(1), 7-23, https://doi.org/10.46656/access.2023.4.1(1) https://journal.access-bg.org/\nThis graph shows that there are almost no pronounced deviations from the regression line. Thus, we can\nconclude that the basic assumptions of canonical analysis are confirmed."

            "text": "Therefore, taking into account the dynamism and variability of structural interrelationships in investment activity, it is appropriate to conduct an analysis of the structure of capital investments of enterprises by types of activity, as a decision-making support tool in the formation of investment policy. It was found that the dynamics of indicators that identify structural and dynamic changes in the structure of capital investments of Ukrainian enterprises and the selection of certain structural regimes indicate the dependence of the rate of growth and structural shifts on the political situation in the country, as well as on the coronavirus pandemic, which caused significant fluctuations in the investment activity of domestic business entities. The completeness of the conducted research, the reliability of the obtained results and the understanding of transformations of the investment activity of domestic enterprises when making decisions on strategic planning of the directions of the development of the country's entrepreneurial sector will make it possible to develop an optimal scheme for the redistribution of structural components of capital investments and will allow the formation of scenarios for conducting investment activities to increase the financial result and competitiveness of domestic enterprises on the world market.\nIn addition, the study confirmed that the indicator of the financial performance of Ukrainian enterprises is most influenced gross investment in existing buildings and structures, gross investment in construction and alteration of buildings and gross investment in purchased software. This conclusion prompted us to carry out an additional assessment of the impact of the use of high technologies in the production activities of Ukrainian enterprises on their financial results. Thus, as a result of the method of canonical correlations, we investigated that the indicators of the volume of products sold by enterprises of Ukraine that use high technologies in their production and the net profit received by them are significantly related to the gross investments in the acquisition of software and the number of enterprises of Ukraine that use high technologies in its production.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, N.D., V.M.; methodology, N.D., V.M; formal analysis, V.M.,\nZ.L.; investigation, N.D., V.M., Z.L.; project administration, Z.L.; data curation, V.M.; resources, N.D., V.M.; supervision, Z.L.; validation, V.M., Z.L.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, N.D., V.M.; writing\u2014review and editing, N.D.
