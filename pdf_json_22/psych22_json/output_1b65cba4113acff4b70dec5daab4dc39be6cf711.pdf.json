    "abstractText": "This study aimed to examine gambling motivations for esports betting and skin gambling and their association with gambling frequency, problems, and harm. Data were collected via a cross-sectional online survey with 736 participants aged 18 + who engaged in esports cash betting (n = 567), esports skin betting (n = 180), or skin gambling on games of chance (n = 325). Respondents were asked to rate their motivations for the three activities across seven domains: social, financial, positive feelings or enhancement, internal regulation, skill building, competition/challenge, and skin acquisition. The results highlight both similarities and differences in gambling motivations across products. Financial gain and enhancement (i.e., excitement) were the main motivations endorsed for all activities, whereas skin acquisition was an additional motivation for esports skin betting and skin gambling. Across all three products, gambling to escape or improve mood was associated with higher levels of problem gambling and harm. Financial gain motivation was associated with problem gambling only for esports skin betting and skin gambling on games of chance. These findings underscore the importance of considering motivational influences on engagement with emerging gambling activities, especially since some motivations may be a contributing factor in harmful gambling outcomes.",

            "text": "Many new gambling products connected to video gaming have emerged in the last decade. Three popular products are esports cash betting, esports skin betting, and skin gambling on games of chance. Esports cash betting involves gambling money on video gaming competitions (esports), typically via wagering operators or dedicated esports betting providers. In contrast, esports skin betting involves using virtual video game items known as \u201cskins\u201d to bet on esports, most often via unregulated online operators (Greer et\u00a0al., 2019). These\n* Nancy Greer n.greer@cqu.edu.au\nExtended author information available on the last page of the article\n1 3\nunregulated online operators also often enable skin gambling, where skins are gambled on games of chance (i.e., roulette, jackpots). While participation in these emerging gambling activities is currently rare in general adult populations, participation amongst adolescents and young adults is proportionately much higher (Gambling Commission, 2019; Hing et\u00a0al., 2021b; Hing et\u00a0al., 2021; Russell et\u00a0al., 2020). Early research also shows that esports betting and skin gambling are associated with higher levels of involvement in traditional gambling activities and gambling-related harm, especially for adolescents and young adults (Gainsbury et\u00a0al., 2017b; Greer et\u00a0al., 2021, 2022; Hing et\u00a0al., 2021c, 2022; Wardle, 2019). However, participation in these emerging gambling activities only partially accounts for greater intensity of gambling involvement and harm, suggesting the influence of other underlying factors. One area of research which is important to explore is the motivations for gambling on these emerging products.\nSeveral conceptual models identify key risk factors for gambling involvement and harm, including motivations for gambling (see Abbott et\u00a0 al., 2018; Binde, 2009). Motivation models identify key reasons why people gamble and how differences in gambling motivation type and strength are differentially associated with gambling participation and harmful gambling (i.e., Binde, 2013; Dechant, 2014; Lee et\u00a0al., 2007; Stewart & Zack, 2008). To date little research exists on gambling motivations for esports cash betting, esports skin betting, or skin gambling on games of chance, and the role they play in contributing to gambling intensity and harm. To our knowledge, only one study has examined the impact of gambling motivations in relation to esports betting (Lelonek-Kuleta & Bartczuk, 2021). This study examined four gambling motivations amongst Polish esports bettors (enhancement, coping, social, and financial). However, insights from this study are limited because it measured motivations for all gambling activities combined, and not specifically for esports betting. It also defined esports betting as \u201cesports or virtual sports betting\u201d which conflates esports betting with betting on virtual sports. To our knowledge, no research has examined motivations for skin gambling. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by exploring seven potential gambling motivations for these three gambling products drawn from prior research and theorising: social, financial, positive feelings or enhancement, to regulate internal states, skill development, challenge or competition, and the acquisition of virtual items (skins)."

The Gambling Motives Questionnaire (GMQ: Stewart & Jack, 2008), Reasons for Gambling Questionnaire (RGQ: Francis et\u00a0 al., 2015) and Lee et\u00a0 al\u2019s (2007) five-factor gambling motivational measure all include similar social motivation items. These involve socialising with others, making a social gathering more enjoyable, and because friends are gambling. Social motivations have been linked with gambling on electronic gaming machines (EGMs) (Francis et\u00a0al., 2015), sports, and card/casino table games (Abarbanel, 2014; Fang & Mowen, 2009; Flack & Stephens, 2019; Sundqvist et\u00a0al., 2016). Similar social motivations may apply to esports cash betting, esports skin betting, and skin gambling given their similarity to these traditional gambling activities. Social interaction is also an important motivation for watching esports (Macey et\u00a0al., 2020) and playing esports (B\u00e1nyai et\u00a0al., 2020; Lee & Schoenstedt, 2011; Weiss & Schiele, 2013), which could carry over into esports cash or skin betting. Furthermore, in line with research on buying virtual\n1 3\ngaming items, gamblers may be engaged in esports skin betting or skin gambling to acquire skins to increase their social status amongst peers and in return receive more social interaction and friends (Calado et\u00a0al., 2014; Cleghorn & Griffiths, 2015; Gainsbury et\u00a0al., 2016; Hamari et\u00a0al., 2017; Marder et\u00a0al., 2019; Rockloff et\u00a0al., 2020)."

As with traditional gambling activities, esports cash betting is likely motivated by financial gain. In contrast, making a financial profit from esports skin betting and skin gambling requires that skins won are transferred out of the skin gambling website and sold for money through a skin exchange or by trading. The poor regulation of skin gambling and lack of consumer protection could result in players losing their skin inventories and the monetary value they have. Therefore, the added difficulty and risk of converting skins to money could result in esports skin bettors and skin gamblers being less motivated by financial gain than esports cash bettors."

Similar enhancement motivations have been found for online gaming (Demetrovics et\u00a0al., 2011; Myrseth et\u00a0al., 2017), spending money in virtual worlds (M\u00e4ntym\u00e4ki & Salo, 2015), and buying other virtual items with chance-based contents known as \u201cloot boxes\u201d (Rockloff et\u00a0al., 2020; Zendle et\u00a0al., 2019). Similar to traditional gambling and video gaming activities, positive feelings such as excitement could be a key motivator for esports betting (cash or skins) and skin gambling.

The motivation to escape for an individual could extend beyond general consumption of video games and esports into esports cash betting, esports skin betting, or skin gambling. Research has found that escape and coping motivations are particularly\n1 3\nsalient for gambling on chanced-based activities such as EGMs (Abarbanel, 2014; Fang & Mowen, 2009; Francis et\u00a0al., 2015; Nower & Blaszczynski, 2010; Sundqvist et\u00a0al., 2016; Thomas et\u00a0al., 2009)."

Esports betting, whether with money or skins, can also involve skills such as knowledge of esports players, teams, and the game.

For esports betting (cash or skins), motivations of competition and challenge may be embedded in the gambler\u2019s perceived knowledge of esports games, players, and teams\u2014which gives them both a (perceived) competitive edge against others and an intrinsically rewarding challenge. In contrast, skin gambling primarily involves simple versions of chance-based activities such as roulette, blackjack, jackpots, EGMs, coinflips, and case openings (Greer et\u00a0al., 2020; Grove, 2016), which lack skilled play and arguably are less challenging for gamblers than esports betting. Additionally, the competition and challenge of gambling with skins on esports or games of chance may also relate to obtaining virtual items (skins), especially if they are unique."

In addition to being able to exchange skins for money, skins won can be transferred from the gambling operator\u2019s website to a video game player\u2019s inventory, used in gameplay, or traded with other players (Greer et\u00a0al., 2019; Grove, 2016). The motivation to gamble with skins to obtain skins for gameplay is supported by research on why gamers purchase virtual items in video games, social casino games, and loot boxes (Hamari et\u00a0al., 2017; Hilgard et\u00a0al., 2013; Hussain & Griffiths, 2014; Kim et\u00a0al., 2016; Rockloff et\u00a0al., 2020; Yee et\u00a0al., 2012; Zendle et\u00a0 al., 2019). This research has found in-game purchases of virtual items, including loot boxes, are driven by motivations to customise the game and acquire in-game rewards or items. Another motivation for obtaining skins from gambling may be for collectability, particularly for rare or exclusive items (Cleghorn & Griffiths, 2015; Rockloff et\u00a0al., 2020; Zendle et\u00a0al., 2019). Amongst gamers aged 16\u201318\u00a0years (Zendle et\u00a0al., 2019) nearly one-fifth (19.2%) were motivated to buy loot boxes \u201cto gain specific items and characters,\n1 3\nand to create a collection\u201d. An Australian study found one of the top motivations for loot boxes purchasers was to \u201ccomplete a set of items for a collection\u201d (Rockloff et\u00a0al., 2020). Lastly, another motivation for skin betting on esports or games of chance may be to win skins to exchange for other skins. Although not as prevalent as motivations to get rare or new items or for their collection, Rockloff et\u00a0al. (2020) found around 40% of loot box purchasers were motivated to \u201chave items to trade with others for more preferred items\u201d."

Francis et\u00a0al. (2015) also found regular gamblers to have higher scores than nonregular gamblers on motivations for regulation of internal states, social, and challenge. No research to date has explored how these gambling motivations may impact frequency of gambling on esports or with skins. The impact of motivations involving skill building and acquisition of virtual items on gambling intensity present a gap in the literature since they have not been explored for esports betting and skin gambling.\nThe primary gambling motivations associated with problem or harmful gambling are enhancement (i.e., excitement) (Browne et\u00a0al., 2019; Flack & Morris, 2015; Francis et\u00a0al., 2015; Lambe et\u00a0al., 2015; Rockloff & Dyer, 2006; Rodrigeuz et\u00a0al., 2015; Stewart & Zack, 2008; Wardle et\u00a0 al., 2011), financial gain/money (Browne et\u00a0 al., 2019; Lee et\u00a0 al., 2007; Russell et\u00a0al., 2019; Tabri et\u00a0al., 2021; Wardle et\u00a0al., 2011), and regulation of internal states as measured by coping (Lambe et\u00a0al., 2015; Stewart & Zack, 2008; Wardle et\u00a0al., 2011) and escape (Browne et\u00a0 al., 2019; Flack & Morris, 2015; Rockloff & Dyer, 2006; Rodrigeuz et\u00a0 al., 2015; Thomas et\u00a0 al., 2009). The only study that has examined gambling motivations relating to the three emerging products explored here was in a sample of esports bettors using the GMQ-F measure (Dechant, 2014).

Significance testing on the differences in individual motivation items between esports cash betting, esports skin betting, and skin gambling could not be conducted given the samples across the three activities were not independent. Three univariate logistic regressions were conducted to examine, when controlling for age and gender, the independent contribution of the gambling motivations as predictors (IVs) of regular gambling (less than monthly/at least monthly) for esports cash betting, esports skin betting, and skin gambling (DVs). For each of the three gambling products, two ordinal regressions were conducted with age, gender, and gambling motivations as IVs and problem gambling severity (4 categories) and gamblingrelated harm (4 categories) as DVs."

Being older was correlated with higher scores on the skill building and competition/challenge motivations for esports skin betting (r = 0.248, p = 0.001 and r = 0.315, p < 0.001 respectively) and skin gambling (r = 0.224, p < 0.001 and r = 0.229, p < 0.001, respectively).

No age differences were found for the social, financial, enhancement, or skin acquisition motivations for any product.\nSignificant differences in gambling motivation scores were found by gender across the three products.

            "text": "Esports cash betting was primarily driven by the financial motivation \u201cto win money\u201d followed by enhancement motivations, with the latter being more so for excitement and less so for enhancing viewership of the esports match. These findings are consistent with quantitative research on motivations for traditional gambling activities (i.e., Flack & Morris, 2015; Francis et\u00a0al., 2015; Lee et\u00a0al., 2007; Stewart & Zack, 2008; Tabri et\u00a0al., 2021) and qualitative research on sports betting motivations (Gordon et\u00a0al., 2015; Lamont & Hing, 2018) that excitement and financial gain are primary gambling motives. The competition/ challenge motivations were also moderately important to esports cash betting, with the \u201cfor the challenge\u201d item rating slightly higher than \u201cto compete with others\u201d. The finding that challenge and competition are important aspects to esports cash betting is not surprising given the similarities between esports betting and traditional sports betting. For example, both products are offered by the same wagering operators, both involve competition (Gordon et\u00a0 al., 2015) and a high proportion of esports bettors also bet on traditional sports (Greer et\u00a0al., 2021). Furthermore, while skill building was a less common motivation for esports cash betting, skill building was the only motivation that was positively associated with being both a regular esports cash bettor and higher problem gambling severity. It could be that esports cash betting offers an avenue to practice for similar gambling activities such as sports betting and in turn promotes more frequent gambling and the development of disordered gambling. In addition, erroneous cognitions that gambling outcomes are determined by skill rather than chance is considered a risk factor for problem gambling, and skill-building is a motivation supporting these cognitions (Abbott et\u00a0al., 2018; Russell et\u00a0al., 2019; Williams et\u00a0al., 2012). Furthermore, being more motivated by regulation of internal states (escape, improve mood) for esports cash betting was significantly associated with higher problem gambling severity and experiencing more gambling-related harms. These results are consistent with similar findings on traditional gambling forms (Browne et\u00a0al., 2019; Flack & Morris, 2015; Francis et\u00a0al., 2015; Lambe et\u00a0al., 2015; Rockloff & Dyer, 2006; Rodrigeuz et\u00a0al., 2015; Stewart & Zack, 2008; Wardle et\u00a0al., 2011). In addition, the findings align to theory that emotionally vulnerable gamblers and negative coping styles are associated with problem gambling (Abbott et\u00a0al., 2018; Blaszczynski & Nower, 2002; Kurilla, 2021)."

            "text": "In contrast, esports skin betting was highly driven by motivations around skin acquisition (i.e., collection, exchange for skins, use in video games), followed by enhancement (\u201cfor the excitement\u201d) and the two financial motives (\u201cto win skins to exchange to money\u201d, then \u201cto win money\u201d). The competition/challenge motivations were similar to esports cash betting, being rated as moderately important. Additionally, higher competition/challenge motivations were associated with more frequent gambling for esports skin betting but not esports cash betting. The competition/challenge motives for esports skin betting may be more about obtaining skins than the esports competition, whether as a challenge for themselves (i.e., get a rare skin for their collection) or in competition with other video gamers. In turn, this competition may drive greater gambling frequency in the effort to obtain skins. However, competition/challenge motivations were not similarly predictive of downstream gambling problems or harm. Being more highly motivated for esports skin betting\n1 3\nby regulation of internal states (escape, improve mood) and financial gain, in contrast, was associated with more frequent esports skin betting, greater problem gambling severity and harm \u2013 consistent with recent research with esports bettors (Lelonek-Kuleta & Bartczuk, 2021) and decades of gambling research investigating other forms (e.g., EGMs)."

            "text": "The main motivations for skin gambling on games of chance closely aligned with those for esports skin betting: skin acquisition, enhancement, and financial motives. The finding that winning skins for non-monetary gain was just as important as financial gain highlights the attraction of monetised video gaming activities where randomised items can be won, as observed in studies of loot boxes (Rockloff et\u00a0al., 2020; Zendle et\u00a0al., 2019). The finding that skin gambling was less motivated by competition/challenge than esports cash and skin betting reflects that, as games of chance, most skin gambling activities are played alone with randomly generated outcomes. Stronger competition/challenge motivations for skin gambling were associated with more frequent gambling on this activity, but again not problem or harmful gambling. As before, higher motivations for regulation of internal states for skin gambling on games of chance was associated with greater problem gambling severity, and gambling-related harms. Lastly, financial motivations for skin gambling were associated with both greater problem gambling severity and gambling-related harms. These findings position skin gambling as comparable to monetary forms of gambling, which when motivated by financial gain also increase the likelihood of harmful gambling (Browne et\u00a0al., 2019; Dechant, 2014; Francis et\u00a0al., 2015; Lee et\u00a0al., 2007; Tabri et\u00a0al., 2021). It is notable that skin gambling on games of chance is functionally equivalent to other forms of gambling (e.g., EGMs, casino games), with the exception that the underlying currency is skins rather than fiat currency."

            "heading": "Limitations and\u00a0Future Research",
            "text": "There are some limitations of this research which should be considered. First, the findings are only generalisable to the sampled adults who were predominately young adult males. This aligns with research indicating that esports bettors are more likely to be young males (i.e., Browne et\u00a0al., 2019; Gainsbury et\u00a0al., 2017a). Nonetheless, recruiting participants via social media and crowdsourcing, as well as non-completions and those who failed data quality checks, may have biased to the final sample characteristics. Further research is needed on the extent and impact of motivations for gambling on emerging products in the general adult population, as well as amongst children and adolescents. Second, the cross-sectional nature of the research only infers associations between variables and not necessarily causality, which would be better captured by longitudinal research. Third, in the logistic regression analyses the odds ratios for gambling motivations which significantly predicted regular gambling, problem gambling, and gambling-related harm were all relatively small and the total variance of the dependent variables explained ranged between 6 and 29%. This suggests other factors in addition to age, gender, and gambling motivations influence gambling frequency, problematic gambling, and gambling-related harm. Future research could examine gambling motivations for these products while accounting for other variables known to contribute to harmful gambling, such as gambling behaviours (frequency, money, time), impulsivity, and erroneous gambling cognitions (Browne et\u00a0 al., 2019; Lambe et\u00a0 al., 2015; Russell\n1 3\net\u00a0al., 2019). Lastly, the current study assessed gambling motivations based on validated measures of traditional gambling motivations, online gaming motivations, and qualitative research. Future studies should look to validate measures of gambling motivations independently for esports cash betting, esports skin betting, and skin gambling."

            "text": "The current study provides insights into why people gamble on esports and with skins, which has been a relatively unexplored area of research. Engagement in esports cash betting, esports skin betting, and skin gambling on games of chance all appear to be motivated primarily by enhancing positive feelings such as excitement, winning money directly or via exchanging skins; i.e., for largely non-monetary purposes. The importance of skin acquisition is currently unique to esports skin betting and skin gambling, distinguishing it from esports cash betting and other traditional monetary forms of gambling. Despite the importance of skin acquisition, there was no evidence that this motivation was associated with more regular, problematic, or harmful gambling. However, motivations of financial gain via esports skin betting and skin gambling (games of chance) were associated with greater problem gambling severity. In line with traditional gambling activities, negative reinforcement, i.e., esports betting or skin gambling to relieve negative emotions or to escape, was associated with being at greater risk for experiencing gambling problems and harm. Further research is needed to confirm these results. Replication of these findings in representative samples would suggest that education and public health programs should attempt to dissuade young people from engaging in esports betting and skin gambling as a means of financial gain or as a way to escape from negative emotions (Rockloff et\u00a0al., 2011).\nAuthors Contributions NG designed the study, conducted the statistical analyses, and drafted the manuscript.
