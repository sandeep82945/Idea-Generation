Performance in activities of daily living (ADL) at\nthree different levels [basic (The Katz Index of Independence), instrumental\n(Lawton instrumental ADL scale) and advanced (Reuben\u2019s advanced ADL\nscale)], measured through self- and informant-report, as well as awareness\n(discrepancy between self- and informant-report), were compared between\ngroups. Stepwise regression models explored predictors of ADL and\ntheir awareness.\nResults: PwD showed impairment in all ADL levels, particularly when\nmeasured through informant-report. No differences were seen between\ncontrols and PwMCI regardless of measurement type. PwD differed in\nawareness of instrumental and basic, but not of advanced ADL, compared\nto controls. Age, gender, education and fluency were the most consistent\npredictors for ADL. Diagnosis was a significant predictor only for instrumental\nADL. Awareness of basic ADL was predicted by memory, and awareness\nof instrumental ADL was predicted by general cognitive status, educational\nlevel, and diagnosis.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 01 frontiersin.org\nConclusion: Results reinforce the presence of lack of awareness of ADL\nin PwD. Use of informant-reports and cognitive testing for fluency are\nsuggested for the clinical assessment of ADL performance. Finally, assessment\nof instrumental ADL may be crucial for diagnostic purposes.\nKEYWORDS\ndementia, MCI, ADL, cognition, awareness, dependence, functional impairment"

            "text": "Functional capacity, i.e., the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL), is an important variable in the context of aging, being affected by a variety of chronic conditions linked to older age. Loss of functional ability is commonly associated with cognitive decline in older adults (1), and can be the distinguishing diagnostic criterion between dementia and mild cognitive impairment (2) (MCI), both being characterized by cognitive decline. It is known that there is a progressive loss of functional capacity in the course of dementia, with deficits in cognition and other abilities affecting the capacity to perform daily activities (3\u20135). Nevertheless, previous studies provided conflicting results in relation to the extent to which functional capacity is affected at each moment of the condition, probably due to the heterogeneity of patients under the same diagnosis but on different stages of the illness and with different degrees of cognitive impairment (6\u20139).\nOne important issue when considering the relationship between ADL performance and cognitive impairment is the existence of different levels of functional capacity according to the complexity of the activity (10). Typically, three levels are suggested: basic ADL, including simple self-care duties such as bathing and eating; instrumental activities, involving more complex tasks such as handling money and preparing meals; and advanced activities, including social life and hobbies. Advanced activities are the first to be impaired with the appearance of cognitive impairment (11, 12), but functional decline progresses until it affects even basic activities (1, 3). Any level of impairment can cause disability and, without the development of compensatory strategies to offset these difficulties, lead to dependence and decreases in the quality of life of people affected and their caregivers (13).\nThe notion of a hierarchy of ADL is particularly important for the diagnosis of MCI. Initially, it was believed that all levels of ADL would be preserved in this condition (2). However, studies have found that it may be possible to see subtle changes (12, 14), especially in more complex advanced activities (3, 11). It is possible that some measures are not sensitive enough to capture these subtle changes, especially when the activity can still be completed even when the subject makes mistakes (15, 16). Few studies have explored these small variations, but the\nones that do suggest that performance accuracy will decrease with the escalation of cognitive impairment until the ability to live independently becomes fully compromised (15).\nStudies that analyze the cognitive processes related to loss of functional capacity vary in their conclusions. In general, some evidence suggests that executive functioning is the best predictor of functional capacity (3, 8), but there is also evidence that deterioration in the ability to perform everyday tasks could be related to a general cognitive impairment (17). It is also useful to differentiate between commission errors (performing a step incorrectly\u2014using salt instead of sugar to make a cake) and omission errors (not performing a step\u2014not using sugar at all), with only the latter error being related to a deficit in general cognitive resources (17). Other studies found that omission errors seem to be also linked to memory impairment (14, 15). Generally, studies that search for cognitive correlates of functional capacity focus on one function, one diagnosis or one ADL level at a time, instead of combining all of them. Advanced ADL are the least studied (3).\nOne potential issue leading to heterogeneity of results may be that cognitively impaired patients do not fully acknowledge the extent to which they have functional impairments. This lack of awareness about the diagnosis and its consequences has been termed anosognosia. Although findings are mixed, it has been shown that people with MCI (PwMCI) may have limited awareness about their abilities (18). A recent meta-analysis, for example, suggested that there already is mild anosognosia of cognitive abilities in PwMCI, and that it becomes more severe in dementia (19), despite the relationship between awareness and dementia severity not being linear (20, 21). Lack of awareness was mainly measured by comparing informant- and self-reports in identified studies (19) and results suggest that the use of informant-based measures assessing functional abilities may be relevant not only to PwD, but also to PwMCI.\nA better understanding of the association between cognitive impairment, ADL performance and its awareness is critical to aid the development of better interventions, rehabilitation programs and compensatory strategies. These studies are especially relevant for low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), considering the scarcity of data from these world regions in comparison to developed countries (22). Studies in LMIC may also shed light on the specific contribution\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 02 frontiersin.org\nof sociodemographic variables to ADL. For example, lower educational level, and consequently poorer executive functions performance, may impact functional capacity.\nAccordingly, the current study aimed to investigate functional capacity and awareness in dementia and MCI with a sample from a LMIC. Specifically, three levels of ADL were explored (advanced, instrumental and basic), measured both by self- and informant-report. In addition to exploring differences between patient groups, sociodemographic and cognitive correlates for each type of ADL and awareness of functional ability were also investigated."

During stage I, a gender and age-stratified sample from a Brazilian private healthcare plan received home visits by trained research assistants and had their cognitive performance and functional capacity assessed, respectively, by the Mini-Mental State Examination (25, 26) (MMSE) and the Functional Activities Questionnaire (27, 28) (FAQ). The criteria for inclusion in the FIBRA study were having been a client of the health care plan for at least 12 months, being at least 65 years old, and a resident in one of the districts of the North Zone of Rio de Janeiro City.\nDuring stage I, the sample was divided into two groups based on MMSE and FAQ performances. The first one\u2014250 subjects with MMSE \u2265 28, and 215 with MMSE < 28, but without loss of functional capacity (FAQ < 5)\u2014were regarded as cognitively unimpaired and thus negative for dementia syndrome and MCI. From this group, a sample (n = 44) was drawn randomly for evaluation in Stage II, to check for the presence of false negatives (none of them were diagnosed as having dementia). The second group\u2014271 subjects with MMSE scores < 28 and FAQ \u2265 5\u2014were considered suspected of having dementia or MCI and were invited to be assessed by clinical and neuropsychological evaluations (stage II). The assessment was carried out by a multidisciplinary team led by a geriatrician.\nThe eligibility criteria defined for inclusion of participants in Stage II\u2014diagnostic evaluation, in addition to their MMSE score as described above, were their score on the FAQ. They were contacted by telephone and referred for a comprehensive geriatric assessment, which included cognitive and functional evaluation. The diagnosis of dementia syndrome and MCI was established by consensus among geriatricians and neuropsychologists according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder-Fourth Edition (29) and\nPetersen (30) criteria, respectively. The diagnosis also relied on laboratory tests and neuroimaging and neuropsychological tests (instruments section below) (23).\nIn order to take part in the current study, all participants needed to have an informant living or being in close contact with them for at least 10 years and being at least 23 years old [such that informants would have been at least adolescents (13 + years) when their contact initiated]. Some participants had missing informant or self-report measures of ADL and were also excluded.\nThe present study analyzed data from 243 participants who fulfilled all these criteria. Based on these assessments, the sample was split into the following subgroups: 104 participants diagnosed with dementia; 45 diagnosed with MCI and 94 healthy older adults (hereafter, control participants). Although information about dementia subtype was not fully available for the dementia group, most had a diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease."

            "text": "Results have shown more impairments in all ADL levels for PwD. Considering self-reported ability, PwD were more impaired than controls in advanced and instrumental activities\nand more impaired than PwMCI in instrumental and basic activities. In the informant-reported measures, PwD were more impaired than both groups in all types of ADL. No differences were seen between controls and PwMCI regardless of type of measure. Age, gender, education and fluency were the most consistent predictors for ADL performance, across measurement types and level of complexity. Regarding awareness, for advanced ADL there were no differences between groups and no significant regression model. By contrast, PwD showed decreased awareness relative to controls for instrumental and basic, and relative to MCI for basic ADL. Memory was the only predictor for basic ADL awareness, while diagnosis, general cognitive status and educational level were significant predictors for instrumental ADL awareness.\nSignificant differences found between controls and PwD are in line with standard findings (22). ADL performance gradually decreases with progression of dementia, eventually affecting even basic activities (1, 3). Although all levels of ADL performance were significantly different concerning informantreport, it is important to highlight that the differences in selfreported measures between PwD and controls did not include basic activities. A possible explanation is related to unawareness within the PwD group, also found in other studies [e.g., (44)]. Because basic activities are the last to be impaired in the course of dementia, cognitive deficits may have already affected the subjects\u2019 awareness by then (4). In this case, informants perceive the deficit, but not PwD, who overestimate their performance, attenuating group differences. This notion is supported by PwD showing poorer awareness of ability relative to controls for both instrumental and basic ADL in the current study.\nRegarding advanced ADL, in the self-report measures PwD are impaired only in relation to controls, whilst for informant-report PwD have lower ability in relation to both\ncontrols and PwMCI. Again, this suggests that informant-report may be more reliable to ascertain functional change. Direct comparison of awareness of advanced ADL between groups did not show significant differences, but it is possible this was caused by generally low scoring in the variable (i.e., a floor effect).\nLack of significant differences in ADL between control participants and PwMCI is consistent with the definition of this condition, with MCI being characterized by cognitive impairment in the absence of functional deficits (2). Nevertheless, this has been recently questioned in the literature (12, 17). It is possible that the measures used may not be sensitive enough to detect subtle functional changes (45), with impairments at this level affecting the processes more than their results, making difficulties less noticeable (15, 16). Results indicate that PwMCI show good awareness of their functional abilities, with consistent scores regardless of type of report, something that has been reported previously (46). PwMCI also did not show significant differences in relation to controls in any of the awareness variables, with mean values very close to zero, suggesting accurate assessment of ability.\nCognitive and demographic predictors of functional ability were generally consistent across measurement type and ADL level. Higher phonemic fluency and lower age predicted better advanced ADL for both measurement types; in the informant variable, women showed better functional capacity. Older age may lead to decreases in advanced ADL since it is the greatest risk factor for cognitive decline (13). By its turn, cognitive decline causes loss of functional capacity (1), which starts with advanced activities (11).\nThe presence of phonemic fluency in the models may suggest cognitive processes that are at some level linked to advanced ADL performance. This statement, however, should be considered with three caveats. First, fluency tests are\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 08 frontiersin.org\ninfluenced by a variety of different cognitive processes (47, 48), and also, potentially, demographic variables [e.g., age and educational level; (45), lacking in specificity]. Second, the absence of other cognitive variable suggests that other processes, not cognitive in nature, may be involved [e.g., mood disorder (4)]. Third, in a similar sense, phonemic fluency is a test highly sensitive to conditions that affect the frontal lobes (49) and processing speed (47), which can be linked to mood changes, for instance (50, 51).\nIn the informant report, gender was also a predictor, with women showing better functional ability. Although biological hypotheses could be made, this finding may be more readily explained by differences in perception due to psychosocial and cultural roles. Men usually engage more in work-life (52) and less in hobbies, groups and social activities in life, continuing with this pattern in older age (53). Diminished activities can be seen as normal by men themselves, being reported differently by caregivers.\nInstrumental activities abilities were, in both models, also predicted by age and gender, as well as by categorical fluency, immediate recall and education. Diagnosis and MMSE were present in the informant-report model as well. Age and gender are present in this model probably for the same reasons they were present as predictors for advanced activities. The presence of gender for both informant and self-report may be explained by the fact that men are commonly and consciously less involved in housework than women (52), with instrumental activities measures focusing precisely on this type of activity.\nInstrumental ADL models included more cognitive variables than for advanced and basic ADL. Both self- and informant-report models included categorical fluency and immediate recall. This is consistent with previous findings that relate instrumental abilities primarily to executive functioning and memory (3, 45). Categorical fluency is also related to other cognitive functions (47, 48) and demographic variables such as age and education (54). Regarding this and that informant-report model includes also the variables MMSE and diagnosis, a possible conclusion is that instrumental activities performance depends highly on global cognitive status, as has\nalready been indicated in the literature (7, 14, 15, 45, 55). It is worth highlighting the fact that diagnosis was a predictor only for instrumental ADL, which suggests the diagnostic value of this variable when identifying PwD from those with MCI and healthy older adults. This also suggests that although dementia diagnosis contributes to disability across activities type, other factors, such as age, are stronger predictors of functional capacity.\nEducation is a variable that may often be undetected as a predictor of functional capacity because most studies about the theme have been conducted in developed countries, characterized by higher educational homogeneity. In this study, the variable appeared in instrumental and basic ADL models, both in self- and informant- report. Higher education is one of the factors known to provide higher cognitive reserve (56), a protection against cognitive impairment (56, 57) and consequently against its consequences such as functional loss (1).\nIn addition to education, both basic ADL prediction models included also phonemic fluency. First, it is important to highlight that phonemic fluency is associated with education (54). It has also been shown to be associated with diverse cognitive processes, such as language, executive functions and processing speed (47, 48). Current findings highlight the fact that cognitive impairment can be linked to poorer basic ADL performance (1), despite lower complexity to perform these activities.\nRegarding awareness, general cognitive level was a significant predictor of instrumental ADL awareness, and memory was the only predictor of awareness of basic ADL, although explained variance was low for the latter. Altogether these findings suggest that awareness in can be considered a neurocognitive ability, as proposed by theoretical models (58). Additionally, awareness of instrumental ADL was also predicted by diagnosis and educational level. This reinforces the notion of lack of awareness as a marker of dementia (19), also suggesting that wider social awareness, including access to educational resources and general knowledge about the condition, may impact on self-perception of ability (59). In agreement with\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 09 frontiersin.org\nthe current study, associations between awareness in dementia and educational level have been reported before [e.g., (56)]. There were no significant models for awareness of advanced ADL, which can be explained either by variables not included in the model, such as mood and personality playing a role in perception of advanced ADL, or by lack of variance for this variable in the current study.\nOne limitation of the current study refers to the measurement of the main variables explored. The neuropsychological test battery could have been more diverse, exploring also cognitive abilities such as inhibitory control and planning. Nevertheless, a briefer battery was chosen considering application time and the populational approach used in the current study. Questionnaire measurements of ADL also may be criticized for reduced ecological validity, and, ideally, observational measures should be applied. Nevertheless, in the current setting, such measures were not possible, so future community-based work should consider the applicability of ADL outcomes with increased ecological validity. Another limitation is the lack of information regarding specific diagnosis for all participants within the dementia group. Different types of dementia could have led to distinct profiles in terms of ADL and awareness impairment. Nevertheless, where information is available, most participants had Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the most common form of dementia in older adults. Future studies could explore ADL performance and awareness, as well as their predictors, in different types of dementia."

            "text": "In conclusion, the results imply lack of awareness of ADL ability, as well as poorer performance, in PwD, with a subtle decrease in performance in PwMCI in advanced activities. As informant-report consistently showed differences between PwD and both other diagnostic groups in all ADL levels, using informant measures may be crucial for clinical assessment of functional capacity. Using ADL screening may be especially important to LMIC countries, where more expensive methods are not available (60). Regarding cognition, testing fluency can also have an important role as it appeared as a predictor of all ADL types of performance. Even though cognition may play a smaller role in advanced ADL abilities, instrumental abilities are the most consistently affected within each diagnostic group. This finding suggests that the latter level may be the one most directly and purely affected by global cognitive impairment, which is reinforced by the inclusion of diagnosis as a significant predictor. Finally, it is worth highlighting the finding about the relationship between educational level and ADL, considering that this factor may be often overlooked in more developed regions. This suggest that educational achievement, as well as improving cognitive reserve, may, potentially, have a direct impact in functional capacity, warranting further studies in developing countries."
