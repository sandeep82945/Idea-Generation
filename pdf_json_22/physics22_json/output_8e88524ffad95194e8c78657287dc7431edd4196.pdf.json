    "abstractText": "The mid-infrared (MIR) band entangled photon source is vital for the next generation of quantum communication, quantum imaging, and quantum sensing. However, the current entangled states are mainly prepared in visible or near-infrared bands. It is still lack of high-quality entangled photon sources in the MIR band. In this work, we optimize the poling sequence of lithium niobate to prepare two kinds of typical entangled states, the Hermit-Gaussian state and the comb-like entangled state at 3.2 \u03bcm. We have also calculated the photon pair rates and estimated the effect of fabrication resolution in the schemes. Our approach will provide entangled photon sources with excellent performance for the study of quantum information in the MIR band.",

However, the current entangled states are mainly prepared in visible or near-infrared bands. It is still lack of high-quality entangled photon sources in the MIR band. In this work, we optimize the poling sequence of lithium niobate to prepare two kinds of typical entangled states, the Hermit-Gaussian state and the comb-like entangled state at 3.2 \u00b5m. We have also calculated the photon pair rates and estimated the effect of fabrication resolution in the schemes. Our approach will provide entangled photon sources with excellent performance for the study of quantum information in the MIR band.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe entangled photon source in the mid-infrared (MIR) band (approximately 2-20 \u00b5m) is promising for the next generation of quantum communication, quantum imaging, and quantum sensing[1, 2]. In quantum communication, the entangled photon source in the wavelength between 3 \u00b5m and 5 \u00b5m covers the atmospheric transmission window, which has higher transparency than that in the near-infrared band and is beneficial for free-space quantum communications [3]. In quantum imaging, room temperature objects emit light at MIR wavelengths, therefore the MIR band entangled photon sources are compatible with novel applications in infrared thermal imaging [4, 5]. In quantum sensing, the MIR band entangled photon source has strong absorption bands of a variety of gases, which leads to essential applications in gas quantum sensing [6]. With the help of entanglement, the sensing precision may be improved from the shot noise limit to the Heisenberg limit [7].\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is one of the widely used methods to prepare an entangled photon source. Recently, several works have investigated the generation of entangled photons in MIR range from an SPDC process in the nonlinear crystal. From the theoretical side, in 2016, Lee et al reported a scheme for the generation of polarization-entangled state from periodically poled potassium niobate (PPKN) covering 3.2 to 4.8 \u00b5m [8]; In 2018, McCracken et al numerically investigated six novel nonlinear crsystals in order to generate MIR single photons [9]; In 2020, Kundys et al numerically studied the reconfigurable MIR single-photon sources in PMN-0.38PT crystal at 5.6 \u00b5m [10]; In 2021, Wei et al theoretically investigated the preparation of MIR spectrally uncorrelated biphotons from an SPDC process using doped lithium niobate (LN) crystals [11];\n\u2217 These authors contributed equally to this work. \u2020 xyhao.321@163.com \u2021 yangzixiangyzx@foxmail.com \u00a7 jin@wit.edu.cn\nThese schemes for single photon can also be upgraded to prepare entangled photons. From the experimental side, in 2020, Prabhakar et al demonstrated an entangled photons source at 2.1 \u00b5m generated from type-II PPLN crystals [12].\nPPLN is one of the most promising crystals for MIR entangled photon source, not only for its large nonlinear coefficient and wide transparency range [13, 14], but also for its group velocity-matched (GVM) wavelengths, which are in the MIR range [11]. However, from the viewpoint of quantum state engineering, the previous entangled source with PPLN is still not optimal [11, 12]. For a standard PPLN crystal, the phase matching function (PMF) has a \u201csinc\u201d distribution, which has side lobes and will harm the spectral purity of heralded single photon. To overcome the problem of side lobes, one useful method is to adopt the \u201ccustomized poling\u201d instead of \u201cperiodical poling\u201d[15\u201318].\nMany previous works have been devoted to the optimization of a poling period in a periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate (PPKTP) crystal at 1550 nm, and the optimization can be divided into three categories: (1) the optimization of poling order: in 2011, Branczyk et al proposed and experimentally demonstrated the first optimization design of KTP by arranging the poling order [19], and this approach was further improved by Kaneda et al in 2021 [20]. (2) the optimization of duty cycle: in 2013, Dixon et al proposed to design the duty cycle of KTP [21], which was verified experimentally in 2017 [22]; In 2019, Cui et al adopted the Adam algorithm in a machine learning framework to optimize the duty cycle [23]. In 2022, Cai et al optimized the duty cycle of LN using the particle swarm algorithm [24]; (3) the optimization of domain sequence: in 2016, Tambasco et al optimized the domain sequence in the unit of dual domain blocks [25]; In the same year, Dosseva et al proposed to optimize the sequence of single domain blocks using simulated annealing algorithm [26]; In 2017, Graffitti et al theoretically optimized the domain blocks with sub-coherence-length [15], and then verified experimentally in 2018 [27, 28]. Recently, frequency-bin entanglement generated by domain-engineered down-conversion ar X iv :2 21 0.\n12 46\n6v 1\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n2 2\nO ct\n2 02\n2\n2 has been demonstrated theoretically [16] and experimentally [17, 18]. These optimization works were mainly focused on PPKTP and at 1550 nm wavelength. However, for the MIR band, PPKTP crystal is no longer applicable because it no longer meets the GVM condition.\nIn this work, we focus on the MIR band and propose two categories of entangled states at 3.2 \u00b5m, the HermitGaussian (H-G) entangled state and the comb-like entangled state. We will explain how to realize these states by optimizing the poling period of the LN crystal using the domain sequence arrangement algorithm. This work is expected to provide quantum entangled photon sources with excellent performance for the study of quantum information in the MIR band."

            "text": "During the SPDC process, a pump photon with higher frequency impinges on a nonlinear optical crystal, and produces a pair of photons with lower frequency, often referred to as a signal and a idler photon, collectively called biphoton. Without considering higher order nonlinear effects, the joint spectral amplitude (JSA) of downconverted photons is given by the product of PMF and pump envelope function (PEF)[29, 30]:\nf(\u03c9s, \u03c9i) = \u03c6(\u03c9s, \u03c9i)\u00d7 \u03b1(\u03c9s + \u03c9i), (1)\nwhere PEF \u03b1 is determined by the spectral distribution of pump photon and is usually taken as a Gaussian function, and PMF \u03c6 is determined by the properties of the crystal. For periodically poled crystals, PMF can be expressed as a function of \u2206k:\n\u03c6(\u2206k) = 1\nL \u222b L 0 exp[i\u2206kz]dz = sinc( \u2206kL 2 ) exp( i\u2206kL 2 ),\n(2) where L is the crystal length and \u2206k is the difference of the wave vector kp(s,i) = \u03c9p(s,i)np(s,i) c , \u2206k = \u03c9pnp c \u2212 \u03c9sns c \u2212 \u03c9ini c \u2212 2\u03c0 \u039b . Using wavelength as the variable, \u2206k can also be written as:\n\u2206k = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 (np(\u03bbp) \u03bbp \u2212 ns(\u03bbs) \u03bbs \u2212 ni(\u03bbi) \u03bbi \u2212 1 \u039b ), (3)\nwhere np(s,i) and \u03bbp(s,i) are respectively the refractive index and the wavelength of the pump (signal, idler) photon. \u039b is the poling period, it can be customarily designed according to the target PMF, which will be discussed in Section IV.\nDue to the energy conservation, \u03c9s + \u03c9i = \u03c9p, so the ridge direction of \u03b1(\u03c9s + \u03c9i) is always distributed along the anti-diagonal direction. To make the \u03c6(\u03c9s, \u03c9i) distributed along the diagonal direction, it is necessary to consider the GVM condition [30]:\n2V \u22121p = V \u22121 s + V \u22121 i , (4)\nwhere V \u22121p(s,i) is the inverse of the group velocity of the pump (signal, idler). Under the GVM condition, \u03b1(\u03c9s + \u03c9i) is perpendicular to \u03c6(\u03c9s, \u03c9i), and their product may achieve a single Gaussian mode. For type-II phase-matched PPLN (o \u2192 o+e, the pump and the signal is o-ray, and the idler is e-ray), the GVM condition is satisfied at the wavelength of 3207.6 nm [11] according to the Sellmeier equation [31]. The joint temporal amplitude (JTA) can be obtained by performing an inverse Fourier transform (IFT) on the JSA:\ng(ts, ti) = \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e f(\u03c9s, \u03c9i) exp (i\u03c9sts + i\u03c9iti)d\u03c9sd\u03c9i.\n(5) The properties of the JSA and JTA can be measured using the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference [32], in which the coincidence probability p as a function of time delay \u03c4 can be calculated as [33]:\np(\u03c4) = 1 2 \u2212 1 2 \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e |f(\u03c9s, \u03c9i)|2 cos (\u03c9s \u2212 \u03c9i)\u03c4d\u03c9sd\u03c9i.\n(6)"

            "text": "For future applications in quantum communication, quantum imaging, and quantum sensing in the MIR band, we propose two kinds of typical entangled states. The first category is the H-G state, while the second category is the comb-like entangled state. Both categories are intrinsically high-dimensional entangled states and can carry more information for quantum communications [28, 34]. Further, the high-dimensional entangled state has a much narrower interference pattern in HOM interference, which is very helpful to improve the precision of a quantum measurement [35].\nFigure 1 shows the JSA, absolute of the JTA, and HOM interference patterns for H-G states and comb-like states. Figure 1 (a1) shows a typical three-mode JSA, which can be obtained by choosing a PMF of secondorder Hermitian function, and a PEF of zero-order Hermitian function. Figure 1 (a2) is the absolute of the JTA calculated using Eq.(5). Figure 1 (a3) is the simulated HOM interference pattern using Eq.(6). Figure 1 (b1-b3) shows cases of a four-mode H-G state. Figure 1 (c,d,e,f) shows cases of ten-mode, four-mode, five-mode, and sixteen-mode comb-like state.

The second step is to prepare the PEF by designing the pump laser[36].\nThe procedure for designing an H-G mode PMF is shown in Fig.2 (a-e). For the three-mode entangled state, the target PMF, \u03c6target(k), is the second-order Hermitian function, as shown in Fig.2 (a):\n\u03c6target(k) = 1\n2 \u221a 2 exp[\u2212\u03c3\n2\n2 (k \u2212 k0)2](\u22122+4(\u03c3(k \u2212 k0))2),\n(7)\nwhere k0 = 2\u03c0/\u039b, k = kp \u2212 ks \u2212 ki, \u03c3 determines the width of the PMF, and we take \u03c3= L/6 .

The K is 10.0389, 10.1502, and 10.2998 for Fig.4(a, b, c). This means a shift 100 nm in poling does not have a strong effect on the spectral correlation.\nIn the practical condition, the fabrication error is random. Based on this consideration, Fig.4(d) simulates the Schmidt number K of the JSA using different fabrication resolution R from 50 nm, 100 nm, 200 nm, to 400 nm. For example, in the case of R = 100 nm, the domain width for each domain is Lc + \u03b3R, where \u03b3 is a random number between -0.5 and 0.5. We repeat the calculation for each R for 100 times, and obtain an average Schmidt number K\u0304 and standard deviation SD. We consider five resolutions in total: 0 nm (the ideal case), 50 nm, 100 nm, 200 nm, and 400 nm. The corresponding of K\u0304 and SD are listed in Fig. 4(d). With the increase of R, the K\u0304 is almost stable, however, the SD increases rapidly. This suggests that one need to consider the trade-off between R and the SD of K in the fabrication process."

            "text": "In Section 4, we only showed how to design the entangled state in Fig.1(a) and (c). Following a similar procedure, other JSAs in Fig.1 can also be designed by changing the PMF and PEF. To design more types of JSA, the PMF and PEF can be chosen to be arbitrary functions, e.g., the triangle function or rectangular function.\nThe entangled states designed in this work are timefrequency entangled states, which can be further updated to polarization-entangled state or hyper-entangled state by setting the crystal in a Sagnac-loop. In this work we only discussed the optimization of the LN crystal, other quasi-phase matched crystals are also worth investigating, e.g., the PMN-0.38PT crystal.\nIn this work we restrict the study in a very specific wavelength in a group-velocity matched regime. However, such frequency-shaped photons can also be produced in the non-group-velocity-matched regime. In fact, the group-velocity matching condition only determines the ridge direction of the phase matching condition, while the custom poling on the crystal determines the comblike structure in PMF."
