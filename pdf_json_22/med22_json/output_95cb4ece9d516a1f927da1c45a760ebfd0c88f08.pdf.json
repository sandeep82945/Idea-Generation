    "abstractText": "Electrically conductive polymers are promising materials for charge transfer from living cells to the anodes of electrochemical biosensors and biofuel cells. The modification of living cells by polypyrrole (PPy) causes shortened cell lifespan, burdens the replication process, and diminishes renewability in the long term. In this paper, the viability and morphology non-modified, inactivated, and PPy-modified yeasts were evaluated. The results displayed a reduction in cell size, an incremental increase in roughness parameters, and the formation of small structural clusters of polymers on the yeast cells with the increase in the pyrrole concentration used for modification. Yeast modified with the lowest pyrrole concentration showed minimal change; thus, a microbial fuel cell (MFC) was designed using yeast modified by a solution containing 0.05 M pyrrole and compared with the characteristics of an MFC based on non-modified yeast. The maximal generated power of the modified system was 47.12 mW/m2, which is 8.32 mW/m2 higher than that of the system based on non-modified yeast. The open-circuit potentials of the non-modified and PPy-modified yeast-based cells were 335 mV and 390 mV, respectively. Even though applying a PPy layer to yeast increases the charge-transfer efficiency towards the electrode, the damage done to the cells due to modification with a higher concentration of PPy diminishes the amount of charge transferred, as the current density drops by 846 \u03bcA/cm2. This decrease suggests that modification by PPy may have a cytotoxic effect that greatly hinders the metabolic activity of yeast.",

            "text": "There is a very close link between electrochemical sensor technologies and those used to develop biofuel cells [1\u20133]. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) convert chemical energy into electric power via microorganism-catalysed reactions [4,5]. Among many other applications, MFCs are promising for treating wastewater and waste from the food industry. The attainable metabolic energy from such devices can partially meet ever-rising energy demands by reducing industry-generated waste in cheap, clean, and renewable ways, without producing toxic by-products. The electric charge from the ongoing substrate oxidation process during microorganisms\u2019 metabolic processes is released and then transferred towards the electrodes [5]. Microbial fuel cells require continuous electric charge release in the\nSensors 2022, 22, 327. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22010327 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 327 2 of 12\nanode and consumption at the cathode in order to generate electrical power [6]. The MFC efficiency greatly depends on the flow of electric charge transfer from the microorganisms to the electrodes [7,8]. Many new materials applied for electrode modification are used to enhance cell performance by increasing electric charge transfer [5,9\u201312]. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is widely used in microbial fuel cell construction as a biochemical reaction catalyst [13\u201316]. This microorganism, also known as baker\u2019s yeast, is commonly used in the food industry; as a result, it appears suitable for use with MFCs in industrial waste treatment [14]. Moreover, yeast cells are extensively used as a model organism to model the performance of eukaryotic cells. They are widely investigated, have a fast reproduction rate and high metabolic efficiency, are inexpensive and non-pathogenic, and can be cultivated under simple growth conditions [17,18]. S. cerevisiae has different membranes: (1) a plasma membrane, by which the cell is separated from the environment; and (2) a transmembrane electron transfer protein and mitochondrial membrane, which contains proteins connected with metabolism [19]. Yeast uses mono- and disaccharides as carbon sources, which are oxidised by forming two final products\u2013CO2, and H2O\u2014which are both generated over numerous intracellular redox reactions. Bioenergy is usually transferable via redox reactions induced by other materials with high redox activity, e.g., redox mediators. Due to the complex yeast cell structure, a double-mediator system should be used [20,21]. One of these redox mediators is lipophilic, which can cross all cell membranes and join intracellular redox processes; the second is the hydrophilic redox mediator, which transfers electric charge from the extracellular environment towards the electrode. In such a system, the bioenergy can be converted to usable electrical power. However, in practice, these MFCs generate low amounts of electrical power. One of the possible solutions is to increase charge-transfer efficiency while modifying microorganisms with conducting polymers, which preserve the viability of living cells [22,23]. Redox-active polymers such as polypyrrole (PPy) are promising materials for mediating charge transfer compared to carbon nanotubes or modified organic matrices, due to their chemical versatility, tuneable conductivity, reversible electrochemical processes, controllable nanostructure, and low-cost synthesis [24\u201326]. PPy is a biocompatible material suitable for surface modification of cells and nanoparticles, assisting in drug delivery, and enhancing deep-tissue imaging [27]. This offers a significant advantage over high-cost carbon nanotubes and modified organic matrices with lower capacitance and redox activity [28]. Approaches using redox-active polymers are attracting more and more attention due to their being rather efficient, providing biosensor stability and reagent-free assay with no mediator wash-out during the procedure, and being usable for creating biosensors based on microbial cells [29]. Additionally, carbon nanotubes and conductive polymers can be used together via covalent functionalisation to customise their properties [30]. However, the effect of PPy on cells is as-yet unknown: it could increase cell wall conductivity, permeability, or both. In our previous research, the periplasm of Aspergillus niger was modified by encapsulating it with PPy, and the results showed a noticeable increase in current values [17,31]. Furthermore, in yeast-based MFCs, the most commonly used hydrophilic mediator is [Fe(CN)6]3\u2212/[Fe(CN)6]4\u2212. Low amounts of [Fe(CN)6]3\u2212 are redox-cycled in the yeast plasma membrane as it approaches the transmembrane electron transfer protein, and this cycling can initiate pyrrole polymerisation in between the cell wall and the plasma membrane, causing self-modification [32]. This modification forms a yeast\u2013PPy biocomposite, which can be further used in MFCs, increasing their effectiveness. However, it is unclear how these redox mediators affect cell viability, physiological state, and metabolic activity. Cell size and morphology can be considered when evaluating yeast cells\u2019 physiological state (e.g., form irregularities, diameter, and roughness) [33,34]. Typically, lower viability causes a decrease in cell diameter and increases the roughness of the surface. Encapsulation of yeast cells in PPy could potentially disrupt the cell wall and cause a change in the cell\u2019s topology and morphology [35]. PPy-modified yeast cells are more resilient to sudden environmental changes, since their stiffness significantly increases [36].\nSensors 2022, 22, 327 3 of 12\nThe main aim of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of microbial fuel cells using a yeast\u2013PPy biocomposite. Studies of modified and non-modified yeast\u2019s electrochemical activity, along with the topology and morphology of the cells modified with different PPy concentrations, were carried out to achieve this goal."

Next, 2.5 \u00b5L of 9,10-phenantrenequinone solution was deposited onto the shiny electrode surface. After the PQ dried, a 2.5 \u00b5L drop of the nonmodified or PPy-modified yeast suspension was placed onto the electrode. The modified electrode was covered by a polycarbonate membrane with a pore size of 3 \u00b5m. Electrodes prepared via this procedure were used for both electrochemical measurements and the microbial fuel cell anode. The microbial fuel cell cathode was based on bare graphite with a much higher surface area than the anode. Electrochemical measurements were performed using a Metrohm \u00b5Stat-i 400 Potentiostat/Galvanostat (Utrecht, The Netherlands) and DropView software. All experiments were carried out at ambient temperature (20 \u25e6C). The electrochemical cell consisted of three electrodes: a graphite electrode was connected as the working electrode, a platinum electrode as the counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl (KCl, 3 M) electrode as the reference electrode. All of the components (borosilicate glass titration vessel with a plastic mounting ring and lid, platinum, and 12.5 cm long Ag/AgCl (KCl, 3 M) electrodes) were purchased from Metrohm AG (Herisau, Switzerland). If the concentration of the glucose or other materials was changed during the measurements, it was done sequentially by adding it to the same electrochemical cell. A single potential pulse of 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl lasting for 10 s was applied in the electrochemical cell with the 50 mM pyrrole solution for electrochemical formation of PPy. Four cyclic voltammetry cycles were carried out for each experiment with a rate of potential from \u22120.6 V to 0.6 V, a scan rate of 50 mV/s, and a step size of 10 mV.

            "text": "Modification of yeast with polypyrrole (PPy) is a promising way to increase the charge transfer from yeast to the electrode. However, the modification with PPy burdens the cell replication process to a certain degree, causing the cells to become smaller. From AFM images obtained from the cells modified with different concentrations of PPy, it can be seen that when the concentration of pyrrole in the solution used for the modification of yeast increases, the cell size declines. In addition, polymer clusters, which are visible on cells\u2019 topography, appear after the modification. However, from the AFM images, it is not clear where they are formed\u2014in the periplasm, or on the top of the cell wall. Furthermore, after modifying the cell with different PPy concentrations, an increase in roughness was observed, and surface roughness parameters at the 0.1 M PPy concentration became closer to those of the inactivated cells. Our results show that cell modification with a solution containing 0.05 M pyrrole causes minor changes in cells\u2019 size, shape, form, and surface roughness parameters, making this concentration the most suitable for further use for yeast modification in biofuel cell anodes. The electrochemical analysis also shows that only the solution applied for the modification containing 0.05 M pyrrole increased the charge-transfer efficiency. This result suggests that the modification with solutions containing 0.1 M and 0.3 M pyrrole may have cytotoxic effects, hindering cell activity and slowing down metabolic activity or obstructing glucose supply. Therefore, the microbial fuel cell was designed with an anode modified with PQ and yeast cells modified with a solution containing 0.05 M PPy. The maximal calculated power output of the designed cell was 47.12 mW/m2 at 129 mV. This outcome shows that modification of yeast cells with low concentrations of PPy is a viable option when developing a microbial fuel cell.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualisation, I.M.-V. and A.R.; methodology, A.Z.; software, A.Z.; validation, I.B., T.M., J.R. and A.Z.; resources, I.M.-V. and A.R.; data curation, A.Z.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.Z.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.Z., T.M., J.R., I.B., I.M.-V. and A.R.; visualisation, A.Z.; supervision, I.M.-V.; funding acquisition, A.R.
