 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the given paper:

1. Further explore the antifungal efficacy and toxicity of C18 in mammalian models like mice or rats to determine its therapeutic potential before human trials.

2. Investigate if C18 can act synergistically with existing antifungal drugs like fluconazole against drug-resistant Candida strains. Combination therapy may improve efficacy and prevent resistance.

3. Examine if C18 is effective against other clinically important fungal pathogens like Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, etc. Expanding the antifungal spectrum will increase its clinical utility. 

4. Study the pharmacokinetics and stability of C18 in vivo. Modifications like PEGylation may be needed to improve half-life. Delivery systems like nanoparticles could also be explored.

5. Determine the molecular target of C18 more conclusively. Further studies on its interaction with fungal membranes, mitochondria etc. can provide insights into its mechanism of action. Structure-activity relationship studies can help optimize its antifungal properties.
