    "abstractText": "Chronic stress has a substantial influence on the tumor microenvironment (TME), leading to compromised effectiveness of anti-cancer therapies through diverse mechanisms. It disrupts vital functions of immune cells that play a critical role in anti-tumor immunity, such as the inhibition of dendritic cells (DCs) and lymphocytes, while simultaneously enhancing the activity of immune cells that support tumor growth, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumorassociated macrophages. Furthermore, chronic stress exerts a significant impact on crucial mechanisms within the TME, including angiogenesis, DNA repair, hypoxia, extracellular matrix deposition, and tumor metabolism. These alterations in the TME, induced by stress, result from the activation of the hypothalamic\u2013 pituitary\u2013adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system, in conjunction with epigenetic modifications. In conclusion, chronic stress significantly influences the TME and impedes the efficacy of anti-cancer treatments, underscoring the importance of targeting stress pathways to improve therapeutic results.",

It disrupts vital functions of immune cells that play a critical role in anti-tumor immunity, such as the inhibition of dendritic cells (DCs) and lymphocytes, while simultaneously enhancing the activity of immune cells that support tumor growth, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumorassociated macrophages. Furthermore, chronic stress exerts a significant impact on crucial mechanisms within the TME, including angiogenesis, DNA repair, hypoxia, extracellular matrix deposition, and tumor metabolism. These alterations in the TME, induced by stress, result from the activation of the hypothalamic\u2013 pituitary\u2013adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system, in conjunction with epigenetic modifications. In conclusion, chronic stress significantly influences the TME and impedes the efficacy of anti-cancer treatments, underscoring the importance of targeting stress pathways to improve therapeutic results.\nKEYWORDS\nchronic stress, tumor microenvironment, immunotherapy, anticancer treatments, sympathetic nervous system, neural-immune interactions, HPA axis, personalized medicine\n1 Introduction\nChronic stress has been identified as a significant factor in the initiation and advancement of tumors, as it fosters inflammation and leads to adverse cancer-related consequences such as depression, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and unfavorable prognosis (Kruk et\u00a0al., 2019; Russell and Lightman, 2019; Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et\u00a0al., 2021). This phenomenon can be\u00a0ascribed to the enduring stimulation of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) during prolonged episodes of chronic stress. Consequently, stress hormones such as catecholamines [including norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E)] are discharged from sympathetic nerves, while cortisol is liberated from the adrenal cortex (Wang et\u00a0al., 2022; Wu et\u00a0al., 2022b). In cancer patients during diagnosis and treatment, various neuroendocrine factors such as dopamine, prolactin, nerve growth factor, BDNF, substance P, and oxytocin are commonly observed and undergo central regulation in response to stress (McEwen and Boyd, 2018; Mravec et\u00a0al., 2020).

The nervous and immune systems establish communication through shared soluble mediators and receptors, enabling the brain to detect inflammation and modulate the immune response (Dantzer, 2018). The SNS exerts a dual effect on the immune system, enhancing humoral immune responses while concurrently suppressing cell-mediated immune responses through the inhibition of cytotoxic activity in T lymphocytes and NK cells. This ultimately results in an immunosuppressive TME mediated by stress hormones, particularly glucocorticoids (Qin et\u00a0al., 2021).\nThe TME has gained recognition as a crucial element in the pathogenesis of cancer, encompassing stromal cells, immune cells, endothelial cells, and other resident cell types. These cells, previously considered passive observers in tumor development, are now acknowledged to have a pivotal role in driving cancer progression. A multitude of factors, encompassing intrinsic attributes of cancer cells, the location of tumor formation, the stage of the tumor, and variables specific to the patient, exert an influence on the composition and functional state of the TME, resulting in notable variations (Winkler et\u00a0al., 2023). The dynamic interplay between cancer cells and the TME, comprising stromal cells and extracellular matrix constituents, plays a crucial role in fostering cancer cell heterogeneity, clonal evolution, and the development of multidrug resistance. Ultimately, these interactions expedite the advancement and dissemination of cancer (Kamiya et\u00a0al., 2021).\nChronic stress has been shown to affect the effectiveness of anticancer treatments by exerting an influence on the TME (Hong et\u00a0al., 2022). The SNS plays a role in the formation of pre-metastatic niches (Ieguchi et\u00a0al., 2022). Neurological signals and pathways have an impact on various cancer characteristics, such as metabolism and (epi)genomic stability, as well as supporting microenvironments that promote tumor growth, including immune infiltration and the extracellular matrix (Vaes et\u00a0 al., 2022). Numerous studies have provided evidence that chronic stress can induce alterations in the TME, affecting tumor cells, cancer stromal cells, and the extracellular matrix, thereby facilitating the progression of cancer.\nThis article provides an overview of the impact of chronic stress on the TME, elucidates the underlying mechanisms responsible for TME alterations induced by chronic stress, and underscores the detrimental consequences of chronic stress on anticancer treatment efficacy. These findings underscore the imperative for the implementation of comprehensive anticancer strategies."

The HPA axis involves the secretion of CRH and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which then triggers the release of cortisol by the adrenal gland. Similarly, the SNS can stimulate the secretion of E and NE by the adrenal medulla or neurons.\nWhen triggered by chronic stress, these neuroendocrine systems exert diverse effects on immune and tumor cells within the tumor microenvironment. Chronic stress alters the composition and status of immune cells, impairs immune responses, and enables tumor cells\nto circumvent immune surveillance and develop resistance to drugs. Furthermore, chronic stress disrupts crucial processes such as angiogenesis, cell apoptosis, and metabolism, ultimately fostering tumor growth and progression (Figure\u00a01; Tian et\u00a0al., 2021)."

Furthermore, chronic stress can enhance the accumulation of immune-inhibitory cells, specifically regulatory T and B cells, as well as tumor-associated macrophages. Additionally, persistent stress triggers inflammation in the TME, facilitating reciprocal interactions between cancerous and inflammatory immune cells. Upon infiltration into the TME, immune cells undergo metabolic adaptations (Bondar and Medzhitov, 2013; Bader et\u00a0al., 2020). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), DCs, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) employ paracrine signaling to regulate cancer growth by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines. These cellular components establish communication through direct interactions and the secretion of cytokines and chemokines, utilizing autocrine and paracrine mechanisms (Lorton and Bellinger, 2015; Chen and Mellman, 2017; Greten and Grivennikov, 2019)."

This impairment is associated with the increased expression of stress-induced hormones and Tsc22d3, which diminish dendritic cell maturation and hinder their capacity to activate TCD8+ cells. To address this issue, reactivating the \u03b22-AR receptor pathway and increasing Phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (pCREB) levels is crucial to restore CD40 signal transduction in DCs (Singh and Ranjan, 2023), and enhance the effectiveness of basic dendritic cell-based cancer vaccine therapy (Yang et\u00a0al., 2019)."

Additionally, the endogenous signaling of glucocorticoids within the TME impacts the differentiation of CD8+T cells, thereby compromising the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade (Qiao et\u00a0al., 2021). Activation of the SNS via \u03b2-ARs has been observed to modulate the metabolism of CD8+ T cells within the TME, resulting in hindered infiltration of these cells in murine models of melanoma and colon cancer (Geng et\u00a0al., 2023). Moreover, the inhibition of CD8+ T cell infiltration and function caused by NE has been found to confer resistance to anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies in cases of lung adenocarcinoma and gastric cancer (Muthuswamy et\u00a0al., 2017; Vaes et\u00a0al., 2022). Additionally, the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) by tumor-associated neurons has been directly implicated in the exhaustion of CD8+ T cells, thereby impairing their ability to eliminate melanoma cells (Balood et\u00a0al., 2022)."

The activation of the SNS leads to the secretion of NE and facilitates the synthesis and release of adrenaline and noradrenaline. However, the activation of the HPA axis results in the release of CRH from the hypothalamus, which in turn stimulates the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone ACTH and glucocorticoids (GCs) from the pituitary gland. It is worth noting that this complex cascade plays a significant role in facilitating the secretion and release of GCs from the adrenal cortex. Furthermore, the impact of stress-related hormones on cancer cells is mediated through their interaction with receptors on immune cells, thereby facilitating crucial biological processes including cell survival, programmed cell death, cellular selfdegradation, cell division, cellular movement, and infiltration.\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 04 frontiersin.org\ncan also lead to the generation of regulatory Tregs. Tregs have been linked to tumor growth due to their ability to produce immunosuppressive cytokines (Knochelmann et\u00a0 al., 2018). The glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) plays a crucial role in promoting the development of regulatory T cells (Tregs) by inducing the expression of FoxP3. Furthermore, the activation of the \u03b22-AR in Tregs impedes their ability to produce inhibitory cytokines (Cannarile et\u00a0al., 2019). However, the presence of chronic stress has been observed to result in an elevation of CD4+T cells within tumor tissues, thereby potentially facilitating the differentiation of cancer stem cells (Thapa and Cao, 2023). According to T-cell-extrinsic mechanisms, stress hormones cause CD4+T cells to differentiate toward a Th2 response (Capelle et\u00a0 al., 2022). The utilization of \u03b1GITR antibodies to mitigate Tregs functionality has been discovered to induce the differentiation of CD4+T cells into effector T cells, diminish Tregs-mediated immune suppression, and generate anti-tumor impacts (Zenga et\u00a0al., 2022). The potential alleviation of certain negative effects of chronic stress can be\u00a0achieved through \u03b2-ARs antagonism (Partecke et\u00a0al., 2016)."

MDSCs represent a specific subset of immature myeloid cells (I\u00f1igo-Marco and Alonso, 2019). The process of chronic stress has been observed to enhance the accumulation of MDSCs via the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway, thereby creating a conducive environment for metastasis (Cheng et\u00a0 al., 2019; Mohammadpour et\u00a0al., 2019; An et\u00a0al., 2021). Additionally, chronic pressure-induced adrenal signals effectively stimulate the proliferation and activation of MDSCs, leading to the establishment of an immunosuppressive microenvironment (Mohammadpour et\u00a0al., 2021). The activation of the CXCL5-CXCR2-Erk cascade, induced by chronic restraint stress, plays a crucial role in driving the regulatory and recruiting functions of MDSCs (Cao et\u00a0al., 2021). Furthermore, it is important to note that psychological stress serves as a catalyst for the activation of MDSCs within the spleen via TAM/CXCL1 signaling.

Psychological depression has been observed to exert a notable influence on the infiltration of macrophages in tumors, thereby significantly modulating their activity and inhibitory effects, ultimately impacting prognosis and treatment outcomes (Cassetta and Pollard, 2018, 2023). It has been found that the exposure of tumor cells to NE elicits the secretion of neuropeptide Y (NPY), which in turn facilitates the recruitment of macrophages and subsequent release of interleukin 6 (IL6). This phenomenon leads to the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway in prostate cancer cells (Cheng et\u00a0al., 2019). Furthermore, NE exerts control over the CCL2/CCR2 pathway through the stimulation of the \u03b2-ARs, thereby facilitating the migration and colonization of tumor cells in the lungs prior to metastasis (Chen et\u00a0 al., 2018). Moreover, the \u03b23-AR receptor plays a crucial role in maintaining the equilibrium between M1/M2 macrophages and N1 granulocytes within the TME (Calvani et\u00a0al., 2019).

It is worth noting that NE not only influences the resistance of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin but also compromises DNA integrity (LamboyCaraballo et\u00a0al., 2020).\nFurthermore, chronic stress weakens the apoptotic response of tumor cells triggered by chemotherapy, ultimately impairing the efficacy of cytotoxic agents. This impairment is exacerbated by stressinduced glucocorticoids, which increase cancer cell resistance and reduce the efficacy of multiple chemotherapy drugs, such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin, TRAIL, and fluorouracil (Kanai et\u00a0al., 2020; Cui et\u00a0al., 2021; Butz and Pat\u00f3cs, 2022; Mitre-Aguilar et\u00a0al., 2022).

The incidence of distant events following radiotherapy closely correlates with the level of adrenergic stress experienced by the host. Chronic stress has been found to have detrimental effects on T-cell function, gene expression, and signaling pathways, leading to a reduction in immune factor secretion. Adrenergic agonists exacerbate immune suppression and promote the presence of M2 macrophages, further compromising the immune system\u2019s ability to regulate tumor growth. Furthermore, adrenergic\nagonists also impede the activity and function of CD8 +T cells, directly affecting their effectiveness in targeting tumors (Chen et\u00a0al., 2020). Of particular significance is the decrease in expression of IFN-\u03b3 and Granzyme B in T cells caused by adrenergic agonists, which limits their effector phenotype. This reduction ultimately promotes resistance among tumor cells to radiation-induced cell death, thereby disrupting the anticancer effects of radiation (MacDonald et\u00a0al., 2019).

Therefore, it is imperative to prioritize targeted management of chronic stress in order to enhance the efficacy of anticancer therapies (Figure\u00a02).\nFIGURE\u00a02 This study provides evidence that chronic stress induces the activation of a signaling pathway that significantly impacts the TME. ARs, specifically \u03b1-AR, \u03b22-AR, and \u03b23-AR, play a crucial role in this process. ARs function as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and bind to agonists such as adrenaline and noradrenaline. This binding activates intracellular G\u03b1s protein, initiating a series of reactions that result in increased levels of intracellular IP3, DAG, and cAMP. Additionally, this activation simultaneously triggers second messenger pathways, including PKA, PKC, EPAC, and Ca2+-CaM. Furthermore, the involvement of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), which are part of the nuclear receptor family, is also noteworthy. When GCs permeate the cell membrane and bind to GRs, the Hsp protein dissociates, enabling the primary subunit of GRs to relocate to the cell nucleus and initiate gene transcription. Consequently, the regulation of cytokine and ligand gene expression occurs, thereby impacting protein synthesis programming and epigenetic gene expression. Collectively, these signaling mechanisms induce changes that contribute to the deterioration of the TME and ultimately promote tumor development.

For instance, research conducted on breast cancer cells subjected to the \u03b2-AR antagonist propranolol has revealed heightened levels of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and augmented cellular demise (Montoya et\u00a0al., 2019). Propranolol has also exhibited efficacy in alleviating immune suppression facilitated by IFN-\u03b3-induced PD-L1 expression in ovarian cancer (Falcinelli et\u00a0al.,\n2023).

To summarize, interventions such as antineuronal therapy, neural ablation, and NGF inhibition play a significant role in the management of tumors induced by chronic stress (Logotheti et\u00a0al., 2020)."

            "text": "Targeting immune-suppressive neurotransmitters represents a potential approach for overcoming immune resistance and augmenting the anti-tumor immune response (Xiao et\u00a0 al., 2023). Notably, benzodiazepine-class drugs, functioning as GABA(A)R activators, have been observed to enhance the response to radiation and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) by facilitating direct antitumor effects and the infiltration of CD8+ T cells. Additionally, dopamine signaling has demonstrated potential in promoting the differentiation of tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer and regulating macrophage-mediated inflammation (Liu Q. et\u00a0al., 2021; Chen Y. et\u00a0al., 2022). The investigation of GITR in Tregs as a potential target has revealed that the use of antibodies can facilitate the transformation of Tregs into CD4 + T cells, thereby diminishing their inhibitory impact on tumor immunity (Amoozgar et\u00a0 al., 2021). Additionally, the administration of fluoxetine, an antidepressant, has been found to suppress the mechanisms induced by chronic stress in lung cancer, consequently augmenting the cellular immune response and leading to notable antitumor effects (Yang et\u00a0al., 2021; Figure\u00a03)."

            "text": "The examination of prolonged stress in cancer therapy holds significant significance due to its direct influence on the neoplastic microenvironment, ultimately compromising treatment effectiveness and impairing immune responses. It is imperative to acquire a comprehensive comprehension of the complex interaction between persistent stress, stromal cells, and the immune system to formulate effective treatment approaches. Additionally, elucidating the impact of prolonged stress on neoplastic genetics and expression patterns can yield valuable insights into treatment response and prognosis. The advent of innovative technologies, such as artificial intelligence and optogenetics, offers promising opportunities for addressing chronic stress and improving cancer therapies, thereby enabling personalized and targeted treatment strategies. Furthermore, the potential synergy between \u03b2-blockers and anti-angiogenic agents, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy holds promise for enhancing treatment efficacy. The potential for alleviating the adverse impacts of prolonged stress lies in the implementation of mindfulness and meditation interventions, in conjunction with meticulous evaluation of drug dosage and timing. To advance cancer care and the field of personalized medicine, it is imperative to undertake a comprehensive examination of the interplay between persistent stress, the neoplastic microenvironment, stromal cells, the immune system, and treatment.\nAuthor contributions\nYRL: Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing \u2013 original draft.

These strategies encompass the use of targeted inhibitors, psychosocial interventions, neurofiber therapy, receptor blockers (including both \u03b2-ARs and \u03b1-ARs blockers), modulation of gut microbiota, modulation of the immune system, and the incorporation of traditional Chinese medicine. Targeted inhibitors encompass the utilization of pharmacological compounds, protein inhibitors, and other substances that specifically target metabolic processes. Psychosocial interventions encompass a diverse array of activities, including aerobic exercise, psychotherapy, yoga therapy, music therapy, and mindfulness training. Neurofiber therapy incorporates a multitude of treatment modalities, such as nerve ablation, inhibition of nerve growth factor, and interventions for anti-neural diseases. The classification of \u03b2-ARs blockers includes subcategories such as \u03b22-AR blockers and \u03b23-AR blockers, whereas \u03b1-ARs blockers encompass both \u03b12-AR blockers and \u03b11-AR blockers.\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 12 frontiersin.org\nPublisher\u2019s note\nAll claims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated organizations, or those of the publisher, the editors and the reviewers.
