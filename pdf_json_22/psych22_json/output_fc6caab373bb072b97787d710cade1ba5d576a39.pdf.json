Objectives: To analyze the content in communities created during the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to assess the image of health professionals on social media. Methods: Using datamining methods, we analyzed publications about medical staff in a large community \u2018StopCoronavirus.RF\u2019 which unites more than 400 thousand users. Results: More than 700 thousand entries were \u2018liked\u2019 in the community from March 2020 to March 2021; more than 125000 thousand posts were shared, about 290 thousand comments were written, and all community publications were viewed more than 3 billion times. Publications about medical staff working in the \u2018red zones\u2019 in Russia are distinguished by the largest number of \u2018likes\u2019 (more than 5000) and comments (more than 300). In the publications and comments, the model of modern heroes saving human lives is emphasized. This type of information contributes to the reduction of anxiety and promotion of psychological safety in case of COVID-19 contraction through establishing confidence in the competence of medical staff and their involvement in the fight against the pandemic. Conclusions: These results suggest that the image of a doctor on social media during the pandemic has acquired special value for the population. Publications on the work of medical staff in the \u2018red zones\u2019 help to cope with anxiety associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was funded by RFBR, project number 20-04-60174.",

Gannon1* and J. Reynolds2 1Lucena Clinic, Psychiatry, Dublin, Ireland and 2Mayo University Hospital, Psychiatry, Castlebar, Ireland *Corresponding author. doi: 10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.964\nIntroduction: Lithium is commonly administered to patients in an outpatient department (OPD) setting. Regular monitoring of lithium levels and renal function in accordance with published guidelines is required. In our unit, this is usually performed at OPD review. During the COVID-19 pandemic, reviews were either postponed or done remotely. Objectives: 1. To devise a system to ensure that patients receiving lithium had appropriate blood test monitoring in the absence of traditional OPD appointments. 2. To assess the efficacy of this intervention by recording blood test dates and comparing with pre-COVID compliance. Methods: All outpatients receiving lithium, identified from the hospital database, received (1) a letter summarising the monitoring guidelines and (2) prospectively dated blood request forms. Patients at higher risk of contracting COVID-19were advised to attend their primary care setting. Others were encouraged to attend primary care or our phlebotomy department. Compliance was measured by accessing the hospital\u2019s laboratory enquiry computer based system and compared with pre-COVID-19 figures. Information was anonymised, as per General Data Protection Regulations. Results: 57 patients receiving lithium were identified. Prior to the first Irish lockdown in March 2020, 16 (28%) were overdue testing. Three months into the pandemic, 15 patients (26%) were overdue testing. Conclusions: In the absence of routine outpatient appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic, the provision of written guidelines and completed blood request forms for patients receiving lithium was effective in ensuring monitoring of lithium levels and renal function. This system can be utilised as an alternative/adjunct to OPD review benefitting patients and health service delivery.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.
