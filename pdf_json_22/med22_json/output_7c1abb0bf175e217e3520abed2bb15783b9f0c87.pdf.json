    "abstractText": "In light of the limited therapeutic options with Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) infections, understanding the bacterial risk factors, such as biofilm formation and related gene expression of CRE, is vital. This study investigates the biofilm formation and biofilm-related gene expression of two enteric Enterobacterales with major CR determinants Escherichia coli IMP and Klebsiella pneumoniae NDM-1, which were seen in high prevalence in most common bacterial infections over the past few years. To our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrated the relationship between biofilm formation and the related gene expression, to understand the potential molecular mechanisms during the biofilm formation in CRE. Biofilms were quantified by tissue culture plate assay at the stages of the biofilm development: initial attachment (6 h), microcolony formation (12 h), maturation (24 h), and dispersion (48 h). In a dispersion, event bacteria detach without any mechanical means and colonise another area. To investigate the influence of different growth conditions on biofilm formation, biofilms were quantified under different growth conditions. In parallel, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assessed the biofilm-related gene expression of a cluster of genes, including biofilm maturation, quorum sensing, stress survival, and antibiotic resistance. Structural changes during biofilm development were assessed via confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). We observed that the biofilm formation of CRE is correlated with the biofilm development stages, with maximum biofilm observed at 24 h at the maturation stage. Our data also showed that biofilm growth, under the condition tested, is the major factor influencing the variability of biofilm gene expression quantification assays. qPCR analyses have demonstrated that the expression of biofilm-related genes is highly correlated with phenotypic biofilm development, and these findings can be further expanded to understand the variation in regulation of such genes in these significant CRE pathogens. Our study demonstrated that both CRE strains, E. coli IMP and K. pneumoniae NDM-1, are high biofilm formers, and genes involved in biofilm development are upregulated during biofilm growth. The characteristic of the increased biofilm formation with the upregulation of antibiotic-resistant and biofilm-related genes indicates the successful pathogenic role of biofilms of these selected CRE and is attributed to their multi-drug resistance ability and successful dissemination of CRE in common bacterial infections.",

There has been a vicious cycle of increasing resistance in Enterobacterales, specifically with\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 4788. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19084788 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph\nE. coli and K. pneumoniae. Global dissemination of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) among Enterobacterales has resulted in increased resistance to all penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics, which has led to an increase in consumption of carbapenem [4]. Carbapenem has been recognised as a last-resort drug, as well as often being the treatment choice for infections caused by multidrug-resistant Enterobacterales [5]. However, the increased consumption of carbapenem has, in turn, increased selection pressure and facilitated the global spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) [6]. Infections caused by CRE are a major health concern due to the limited therapeutic options and high mortality rates associated with these infections [7]. According to the published literature, there are three major classes of carbapenem-resistant (CR) determinants. They are classified as Class A, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC); Class B, Metallo-\u03b2lactamases (MBLs), such as New Delhi MBL (NDM), Verona integrin-encoded MBL (VIM), and imipenemase (IMP); and Class D, oxacillinases (OXA)-type enzymes such as OXA-48like carbapenemases [7,8]. It is reported that genes encoding for these CR determinants are mainly associated with mobile genetic elements enabling their rapid dissemination [7,8]. Virulence factors of CRE include different adhesins, haemolysin production, serum resistance, and biofilm formation [5]. A biofilm is a structured community of bacterial cells that are enclosed in a self-produced matrix and adherent to an inert or living surface [9]. Bacterial biofilms are recognised as an important cause of many infections as 65\u201380% of all bacterial infections are related to biofilm formation [10\u201312]. Studies have shown that specific physiological growth conditions and genetic interactions within the biofilms cause a dramatic increase in intolerance to the antimicrobial agents, as well as the association between antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation [13\u201315]. Although some surveys have shown that different growth conditions influence biofilm formation and, in turn, the association with antibiotic resistance [14], how the growth conditions affect the biofilm-related-gene expression was not well elucidated in CRE. Specifically, how the growth condition influences the expression of the genes responsible for the bacterial cell communication pathways in CRE. One form of bacterial cell to cell communication is known as quorum sensing (QS). QS is a cell density-dependent chemical signalling system that controls the gene expression relaying on the cell density and regulates bacterial virulence, including that of motility, adhesion, and biofilm formation [16,17]. The QS system for Gram-negatives includes the autoinducer-2 (AI-2) system, where the gene products of luxS are collectively referred to as AI-2 molecules [18]. In E. coli and K. pneumoniae, some genes have been associated with the AI-2 system, and it has been shown that biofilm reduction and virulence gene expression can be attributed to the repression of AI-2 QS systems [19]. Furthermore, it has been shown that luxS produces AI-2 molecules under low nutrient conditions that are exported and can signal other cells to form a biofilm [18]. Hence, it is essential to evaluate how physiological/growth conditions influence biofilm development and the gene expression profiles, and in turn how these characteristics are correlated with the biofilm-associated drug-resistant pathogens. The increasing incidence of CRE is a serious threat due to the associated poor clinical outcomes, and CRE outbreaks have already been reported worldwide [20\u201322]. This burden is exacerbated when CRE strains produce biofilms as they cause increased resistance to antimicrobial agents [13]. Therefore, this study aims to understand the relationship between the increased resistance of CRE isolates, E. coli IMP and K. pneumoniae NDM-1, with the biofilm formation and genes encoding for antibiotic-resistant and biofilm-related gene expressions under different growth conditions."

Previous studies on biofilm analysis showed that there is a heterogeneity of biofilm formation in different media in a given strain [23,24]. To assess the effect of different growth media on biofilm development, we considered two types of growth media. Tested strains were cultured in two types of media, a nutritionally poor medium, Minimal Salts Medium (AB), and nutrient-rich Luria\u2013Bertani Broth (LB). AB medium was used to mimic the low nutrient condition. For biofilm analysis collectively used three passages for each tested strain. Biofilms were quantified at different growth stages of biofilm development such as initial attachment (6 h), microcolony formation (12 h), maturation (24 h), and dispersion (48 h), at 37 \u25e6C under static and shaker conditions. The effect of aeration and distribution of nutrients on the biofilm formation process were also explored in this study by incubating test strains under shaking and static conditions."

After the intended period of incubation, the broth was eliminated from the plate wells using Pasteur pipettes, and the wells were rinsed twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove any non-adherent planktonic cells. The biofilms in the wells were then stained by the addition of 125 \u00b5L of 1% crystal violet and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The stain was rinsed with sterile water until clean and the dye was re-solubilised with 33% v/v acetic acid [26], which was then left at room temperature for 30 min. Finally, the optical density of each well was measured at OD595 (measured at 595 nm) to evaluate the amount of biofilm formed. A medium-only negative control was included in each assay. The biofilms were classified in categories as strongly adherent (OD595 > 0.5), moderately adherent (OD595 0.3\u20130.5), weakly adherent (OD595 < 0.3), lack of biofilm OD595 < 0.15 and non-adherent (OD595 = 0).

            "text": "Biofilm formation is a significant characteristic of Enterobacterales including Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae [35]. Growth in biofilms promotes the survival of bacterial inhabitants in hospital settings and internal patients, rising the probability of occasional nosocomial infections [36\u201338]. Multidrug-resistant CRE, such as E. coli IMP and K. pneumoniae NDM-1, have been reported as a significant health challenge as they are associated with common community and hospital-acquired infections, and indeed CRE outbreaks have already been reported worldwide [21\u201339]. The clinical risk factors for bacterial infections due to CRE were reported as being well captured; however, bacterial risk factors such as antibiotic susceptibility, resistant mechanisms, and biofilm formation, for those infections due to CRE are limited. Hence, understanding the bacterial characteristics, such as biofilms is of utmost importance to the treatment of the biofilm-associated infections caused by CRE pathogens due to the associated poor clinical outcomes and limited therapeutic options associated with these pathogens. Here, we observed the potential relationship between biofilm formation and the existence of antimicrobial resistance genes. Strong biofilm formation was observed for both E. coli IMP and K. pneumoniae NDM-1, which carry the blaIMP and blaNDM-1 resistance genes, compared to the non-resistant control strains. This rate of stronger biofilm formation was similarly observed in other studies of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae [40]. In addition to strong biofilm formation in E. coli IMP and K. pneumoniae NDM-1, the greatest upregulation of the resistance genes, bla IMP and bla NDM-1 at 24 h, where optimal biofilm formation was observed. This could be due to the fact the ability of these resistance genes to influence the process of biofilm formation, and that has been demonstrated that resistance genes in special plasmids can regulate biofilm formation in Klebsiella pneumoniae [28]. The effect of aeration and distribution of nutrients on the biofilm formation process were also explored in this study by incubating test strains under shaking and static conditions. Our data revealed that both CRE strains were high biofilm formers when grown under static incubation as indicated in Figure 5, and that characteristic could be attributed to their preferred physiological growth condition of facultative anaerobes [41]. Both CRE strains\u2019 biofilm analysis and CLSM revealed a varying amounts of biofilms correlating with the biofilm development stages, where the 6 h stage corresponded to attachment, the 12 h stage to exopolysaccharides secretion and microcolony formation, and the 24 h stage to maturation and stabilisation of a three- dimensional biofilm structure,\nwith detachment and dispersion on the biofilm observed at the 48 h time point. This biofilm development was in accordance with the previously demonstrated studies on Gram-negative bacteria [42,43]. Moreover, both CRE strains demonstrated the maximum amount of biofilm at the biofilm maturation stage (24 h of incubation), as similarly observed in multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates [40]) and drug-resistant E. coli isolates [24]. In E. coli IMP, biofilm-related genes csgA and mqsR showed the highest upregulation at the biofilm maturation stage (24 h) to their role in the mechanism of biofilm formation [44,45]. csgA is part of the curli-specific csgBAC operon, which plays a role in curli-dependent biofilm development via encoding the protein Curli [44]. Their role of Curli in surface attachment and cell-to-cell contact makes them the main part of the biofilm matrices and a contributing factor to the biofilm development mechanism, for which it has been demonstrated that infection-associated bacteria are capable of developing curli-dependent biofilm structures [46\u201348]. Upregulation of the mqsR gene at the biofilm maturation stage could be attributed to its function in motility and biofilm formation, as has previously been described for E. coli [45]. For K. pneumoniae NDM-1, biofilm-related genes bssS, and also fimH, showed the highest upregulation at the biofilm maturation stage (24 h) to their role in the mechanism of biofilm formation [49,50]. bssS encodes a small cytoplasmic protein that is a significant regulator in biofilm formation via signal secretion [50]. fimH encodes for one of the most important virulence factors, fimbriae, which is important for attachment and adhesion and is also required for colonisation and biofilm formation [51]. The upregulation of the stress-responsive gene soxS in E. coli IMP is attributed to its response to the growth condition-related role in protecting bacteria from oxidative stress [23]. The presence of nitric oxide or superoxide-generating factors in growth conditions, such as controlled by locus soxRS. soxR senses the intracellular redox signals of these factors and acts as a potent activator of soxS transcription when being activated [52]. The evgA, another stress-responsive gene, encodes for proteins involved in bacterial signalling pathways that allow for a diversity of adaptive responses to their environment. These adaptive responses are often interceded by two-component regulatory systems which generally depend on a prospector kinase and a response regulator [53]. Collectively, both soxS and evgA play integral roles in biofilm development stages by adapting to different environmental stress responses and contributing to the virulence fitness of E. coli [54,55]. In K. pneumoniae NDM-1 the upregulating stress-responsive entB and ycfM could be implicated in the role of iron uptake in different growth/iron starvation conditions. This behaviour of upregulation of entB and ycfM genes in response to iron starvation was also observed in other parallel studies in poor nutrient and nutrient-rich environments [56,57]. For E. coli IMP, we observed maximum upregulation of the QS genes, tnaA and luxS, at the maturation stage of the biofilm development (24 h), which were highly upregulated irrespective of the growth medium. This finding is coincident with the observation that tnaA and luxS expression influences the microorganisms\u2019 adaption to diverse environmental conditions, and also influences the virulence of biofilm formation [17]. Interestingly we have observed the most extensive upregulation of tnaA is in nutrient-rich media (LB) which contradicts the previous findings on the induction of quorum-sensing genes in nutrient-poor conditions [58]. In K. pneumoniae NDM-1, we observed high upregulation of the QS genes, intl and luxS, at the biofilm maturation stage (24 h in all growth conditions tested), which is following a recent study in an extensive drug-resistant K. pneumoniae clinical isolate where luxS gene expression played a significant role in biofilm formation, polysaccharide production, and metabolic pathways, and was influenced by nutrient availability and other environmental conditions [59]. The high-level upregulation of blaIMP, encoding for carbapenem resistance, could be attributed to the hypervirulence/resistance capability that this strain process at the biofilm maturation stage, which could correlate with its successful dissemination in many common infections [60]. The upregulation of antibiotic-resistant gene marA can also be\nattributed to its role in transcription activation as a part of the marA/soxS/rob regulon, where it regulates more than 40 genes of the E. coli chromosome, resulting in different levels of resistance to a wide array of antibiotics and superoxide\u2019s [61]. Moreover, marA promotes the outflux and inhibition of the influx of antibiotics, giving rise to multiple antibioticresistant phenotypes [62]. Similarly, for K. pneumonia NDM-1, there is the highest upregulation of the carbapenemresistant blaNDM gene and transcription activator ramA at the mature biofilm development stage (24 h). The high-level upregulation of blaNDM-1 can be attributed to the hypervirulence/resistance that this strain process shows at the biofilm maturation stage. Collectively, the variation in the antibiotic-resistant genes tested in these strains could be attributed to the fact of their multi-drug resistant ability, as these strains harbour varieties of resistant determinants in their resistant plasmids that can easily conjugate with other bacteria, resulting in broad resistance to antibiotics [63]. The blaNDM gene is generally accepted by conjugative plasmids, resulting in multiple additional determinants and leading to multidrug resistance [64\u201366]. ramA code for ramA is an actual transcription manager in K. pneumoniae, which has been established to be significant to the bacterial response to antimicrobial challenges and wider the regulatory role in K. pneumonia during infection microbe-host or microbe-drug interactions [67\u201370]. In this study, we considered only a cluster of genes encoding for antibiotic resistance (blaIMP blaNDM-1, marA, and ramA), genes encoding for biofilm maturation (csgA, mqsR, bssS, and fimH), genes encoding stress response (soxS, evgA, entB, and ycfM), and QS gene luxS, and their expression during the biofilm development stages. The formation of the biofilm confined into a selected cluster of genes on two selected resistant bacteria is a limitation of our study. Although present findings from our study indicated the potential role of the subset of genes selected on the biofilm formation, but performing additional studies, such as correlating the biofilm magnitude with the selected resistant determinants in CRE to understand the physiological impact of the biofilms is caused by differentiating gene expression, would allow us to understand the role of resistant genes as indicators for biofilm formation. This may help to better understand the molecular mechanism of biofilm formation over time. Our results showed that in both CRE strains, the gene expression is correlated with the biofilm development stages. The highest upregulation of all the gene clusters selected was observed at the biofilm maturation stage (24 h time point) and down-regulation was observed at the detachment stage (48 h time point) under all growth conditions tested. Therefore, the most interesting point in this study is the morphological imaging by CLSM coupled to qPCR which allowed correlating morphological modifications to gene expression profile."

            "text": "This study evaluated the detailed gene expression analysis considering a cluster of genes that linked with the biofilm development in carbapenem-resistant enteric Gramnegative bacilli, E coli IMP and K pneumoniae NDM-1 strains. We observed that genes encoding for biofilm development are upregulated during biofilm growth in E coli IMP and K pneumoniae NDM-1 strains. Our data showed that biofilm growth, among the studied variables, is the major factor influencing the variability of biofilm gene expression quantification assays. CLSM combined with the qPCR has demonstrated that phenotypic biofilm development is correlated with the expression profile of the selected cluster of genes of biofilm, quorum sensing, stress survival, and antibiotic resistance. Therefore, this morphological analysis combined with the gene expression during the biofilm growth can be used to study variation in the regulation of such genes in these significant CRE pathogens. Considering our data and the published literature, it is thought that these CRE strains, E. coli IMP and K. pneumoniae NDM-1, with high biofilm-forming capacity in many growing conditions, indicate their ability to develop resistance to antibiotics and which is considered to be the major risk in terms of successful dissemination and risk in terms of the emergence of multidrug resistance among these CRE pathogens.\nAuthor Contributions: S.S.: conceptualisation of the study, designing of the study, and preparing the manuscript.
