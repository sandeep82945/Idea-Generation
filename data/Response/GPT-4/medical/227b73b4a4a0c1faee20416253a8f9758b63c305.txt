Development of Advanced Drug Delivery Systems: Research and develop advanced nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems that can specifically target tumor cells with high precision, reducing systemic toxicity. These systems could incorporate stimuli-responsive elements that release the drug only in the presence of specific tumor microenvironmental factors, such as pH or specific enzymes.

Enhancement of Local Administration Techniques: Investigate novel methods of local drug administration that can increase drug concentration within the tumor while minimizing exposure to healthy tissues. This could include exploring new catheter-based delivery systems, microfluidic devices for intratumoral delivery, or the use of ultrasound and other physical methods to enhance permeability of tumors to locally administered agents.

Combination Therapies Utilizing Local and Systemic Delivery: Design and test combination therapy protocols that integrate the benefits of local administration with systemic therapy, including the use of targeted molecular therapies and immunotherapies. This research would explore optimal scheduling, dosing, and drug combinations to maximize tumor kill while minimizing toxicity.

Intraperitoneal Drug Delivery for Metastatic Disease: Specifically focus on the development and optimization of intraperitoneal drug delivery methods for treating metastatic diseases in the abdominal cavity. This could involve the creation of novel formulations or drug carriers that improve the distribution and penetration of chemotherapeutic agents within the peritoneal cavity, potentially in combination with hyperthermia (HIPEC) or pressurized aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC).

Immunotherapy Delivery Routes: Investigate the potential of local administration routes for immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors or CAR-T cell therapy. This research could explore intratumoral injection of immunostimulatory agents or the direct delivery of modified immune cells to the tumor site to enhance the local immune response against the cancer, potentially reducing the risk of systemic side effects associated with these powerful therapies.
