TA, anterior corneal astigmatism (ACA), and ocular residual astigmatism (ORA) were converted to vectorial components (J0, J45), followed by an assessment of the compensatory e ect of ACA by ORA. Astigmatism was defined as a cylinder that was better than or equal to 0.75 diopters (D). Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the related factors for children with full compensation, and the generalized linear model was used to assess the influence of TA on UDVA.\nResults: Out of 4,494 eligible children, data of 4,145 children (92.3%, 9.23 \u00b1 3.15 years, 50.4% boys) were included in the statistical analysis. The prevalence of TA (27.9%) increased significantly with age (Ptrend < 0.001). The distribution of full compensation in J0 and J45 components were similar (22.1% and 25.6%, respectively), which decreased with age (Ptrend < 0.001). The closer the refractive status was to emmetropization, the higher the proportion of full compensation and the lower the prevalence of TA were. Shorter axial length (J0: Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61 to 0.94, P = 0.010), better UDVA (J0: OR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.65, P < 0.001; J45: OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.59, P < 0.001), and longer average corneal curvature radius (J0: OR = 3.72, 95% CI: 2.18 to 6.34, P < 0.001; J45: OR = 2.82, 95% CI: 1.67 to 4.76, P < 0.001) were associated with full compensation. Higher TA was associated with a worse UDVA (\u03b2 = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.04, P < 0.001).\nConclusions: The prevalence of TA gradually increased with age, and showed a U-shaped distribution with increased refraction. Full compensation was associated with smaller TA and better UDVA. This indicated that considering the compensatory e ect of ORA is vital for astigmatism correction in clinical work, which may improve the visual quality.\nKEYWORDS\nfull compensation, total astigmatism, related factors, uncorrected distance visual acuity, cross-sectional study\nFrontiers in Public Health 01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Astigmatism is a significant and common clinical and public health problem. Uncorrected astigmatism may increase the risk of developing amblyopia and various ocular symptoms (such as glare, monocular diplopia, visual fatigue, and distortion) (1, 2). Total astigmatism (TA) is the result of the combined effect of corneal astigmatism (CA) and ocular residual astigmatism (ORA). CA theoretically consists of anterior corneal astigmatism (ACA) and posterior corneal astigmatism (PCA). However, CA usually refers to ACA. ORA was defined as an astigmatism of posterior corneal surface, plus the crystalline lens astigmatism, and astigmatism caused by aqueous humor.\nPrevious studies have shown that the cornea was not spherically perfect, and a compensating mechanism between ORA and CA existed (3, 4). In those studies, ACA often exceeded TA, but a balance between internal and corneal optics helped to minimize TA. ORA, however, could not be calculated simply by subtracting ACA from TA unless the astigmatic axis of total and corneal coincide. Instead, Thibos et al. proposed the calculation formula of J0 and J45 components (5, 6). Both the magnitude and directional of astigmatism were took into consideration.\nThe compensatory role of ORA has been already proved to exist. Based on Park and Muftuoglu (3, 7), the ACA of the same magnitude as ORA but in the opposite axial direction was defined as full compensation. However, few studies have assessed the impact on TA by integrating the compensatory effect between ACA and ORA and there is shortage evidence of the related factors about full compensation. In addition, the magnitude of astigmatism might also result in the reduction of uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) and the visual impairment (8). Therefore, our study aimed to analyze the characteristics of compensatory role of ORA, and the associated factors of full compensation in school-aged children, evaluating its influence on the prevalence of TA and UDVA. We hope that these could help understand the general framework of astigmatism occurrence and progression."

First of all, the local authorities of education provided a list of all schools in Huantai area. Nine schools were then chosen by using convenience sampling. Next, according to the enumeration of grades within the schools, the sampling frame was defined, and ensuring that students aged from 4 to 18 years were included. Finally, classes for each grade level were chosen by simple random sampling. All students in the chosen classes were invited to take part in the research. Children with fundus diseases, cataracts and lens dislocations, or any history of eye surgery, were excluded. Additionally, some\nindividuals with deficient astigmatism data were also excluded from the statistical analysis.\nThe study was approved by the Ethics committee of the Affiliated Eye Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (HEC-KS-2020016KY). Written consent was obtained from parents and children, and verbal permission was obtained from all participants before the examination."

Slit-lamp was the first step to assess anterior and posterior ocular segments, followed by testing UDVA at a distance of 3 meter using the \u201cE\u201d chart (#600722, Good-Lite Co., Elgin, IL, USA). The non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic autorefractive status of participants were measured by an autorefractor (Nidek ARK-1, CO., LTD, Japan) with consistent parameters (the vertex distance: 12 mm; the measurement step size: 0.25 D). The difference between the maximum and minimum values of spherical and cylindrical degree should be <0.5 D; otherwise, remeasurement was conducted. The cycloplegia was done as follows: one drop of 1% cyclopentolate (Alcon, Fort Worth, TX, USA) was applied to each eye every 5 min for a total of three times. The pupil\u22656 mm in diameter was considered as adequate cycloplegia, otherwise, one more drop of cyclopentolate was added and refraction was measured after 10 min. We used IOL-Master 500 (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany) to measure Axial length. If the signal-to-noise ratio was<2.1, additional measures were performed until reliable readings were obtained.\nOther ophthalmic examination steps have been described in detail in previous researches (9)."

Astigmatism is defined as a cylindrical refractive error \u2265 0.75 diopters (D). ACA was obtained by autorefractometry in the range of 3-millimeter corneal diameter and calculated as the difference between the flattest and steepest corneal medians of the anterior corneal surface. The cylindrical axis is equal to the flattest meridian. The sum of the spherical refractive error and half of the cylindrical refractive error was defined as the Spherical Equivalent (SE, expressed as negative values).

The prevalence of TA in children varied with refractive status in a U-shaped distribution (Figure 3B). The closer the refractive status was to emmetropization, the higher the proportion of full compensation and the lower the prevalence of TA were.\nRelated factors of full compensation\nFor J0 and J45 components, comparisons for related factors about full compensation were shown in Table 2. Children with full compensation were more likely to be younger and associated with larger cycloplegic SE, shorter axial length, longer average anterior corneal curvature radius, better UDVA, and smaller TA and ACA (P < 0.001).\nAs shown in Table 3, multiple logistic regression was used to assess the related factors of full compensation (the univariate logistic regression shown in Supplementary Table 1).

Multivariate GLM showed that children with full compensation may contribute to a smaller TA in model 1 (J0: \u03b2 = \u22120.42, 95% CI: \u22120.47 to \u22120.37, P < 0.001; J45: \u03b2 = \u22120.18, 95% CI: \u22120.23 to \u22120.14, P < 0.001) and better UDVA in model 2 (J45: \u03b2\n= \u22120.02, 95% CI: \u22120.04 to \u22120.00, P = 0.015).

            "text": "Using cross-sectional data in Shandong, China, we firstly explored the related factors of full compensation and found the effects of astigmatism on visual acuity. The results showed that children with full compensation had smaller TA. Yet, higher TA was associated with worse UDVA in children after adjusting for age, gender, spherical powers, and parental refractive status. Our study also provided new information on astigmatism distribution in children aged 4\u201318: the proportions of full compensation in the J0 and J45 components were 22.1 and 25.6%, and the prevalence of TA was 27.9%, respectively. However, Park et al. investigated 178 adults (aged 19\u201346 years) and examined the compensation of ORA. They found that for the J0 component, 4% was full compensation, and for the J45 component, 12% was full compensation (3). Their percentages were lower than those in our research in both the J0 and J45 components. This difference might be attributable to the age effect. We found that the efficiency of full compensation decreased with age in children aged 4\u201318 years. The phenomenon may be related to ocular development and myopic progression. The cornea is not perfectly spherical. ACA, PCA, the crystalline lens, the asymmetry of each refractive error component of the eye, the tear film conditions, and intrinsic variation of the refractive index, etc., are the complex factors that contribute to astigmatism (11). A disruption of any factor could affect the compensation mechanism.\nCA theoretically is the combination of ACA and PCA. However, because of the difficulties in measuring PCA and the relatively small influence on TA, CA generally only refers to ACA. PCA was considered ORA in most cases. In addition, other components such as aqueous humor, crystalline lens, and vitreous body contribute to ORA (12), which may help neutralize or offset a portion of the ACA to diminish TA or superimpose with ACA to increase TA. Identifying the compensatory mechanism of ORA can help us understand the\nFrontiers in Public Health 06 frontiersin.org\ndistribution of astigmatism and screen children who need early intervention. It also assists clinicians in designing post-operative RA, reducing unnecessary ORA after corneal remodeling. For example, when ORA exhibits an offsetting effect on ACA, leaving the ACA of the same magnitude as ORA but in the opposite axial direction should be considered in kerato-refractive laser surgery, which may improve post-operative vision.\nChildren with full compensation had better UDVA in the J45 component (Shown in Table 4), and the larger TA was associated with worse UDVA (model 3, shown in Table 4). Similar findings also suggested a positive association between visual acuity and astigmatism (LogMAR acuity = 0.068 + 0.055 astigmatism) (13). Moreover, a case-control study revealed that low-level ORA induced by IOL implantation in patients also reduced their visual acuity (14). The reason is that astigmatism could prevent the human eye from focusing complex visual information on the retina, leading to blurred vision. Continuing to find or eliminate the reasons for ORA remains a goal and a challenge for clinical physicians in precision medicine. The balance between the optics in the eye and the cornea helps minimize ORA. ORA is often unpredictable and affects visual quality. Even excellent ortho-K lens fitting may lead to irregular ORA. This can even result in severe visual discomforts such as double vision, glare, metamorphopsia, and decreased visual quality (15). The accuracy of refractive data measurement and calculation needs to be continuously improved. Therefore, highlighting the need for astigmatism correction, based on the compensation mechanism, is important in clinical work and research.\nOur study found that the magnitude and prevalence of TA showed a U-shaped distribution with refractive status. A similar study\nshowed that children with myopia and hyperopia tended to develop astigmatism (16). In other words, children with refractive errors are more likely to have astigmatism than those without refractive errors. This phenomenon may be related to many factors. When children are young, they have a higher hyperopia reserve and present higher astigmatism. When children grow up, myopia progresses. The increase in axial length (a combined parameter about the chamber depth, and lens thickness, with vitreous chamber depth) may lead to changes in ORA (e.g., lens tilt). This could disrupt the attenuation of TA and thus cause an increase in TA. Correcting astigmatism may be an effective way to prevent and control refractive errors in children.\nAstigmatism is associated with a significant social and financial burden all over the world. Though the precise cost of astigmatism treatment was unavailable, it was reported that the direct cost of myopia for each subject was $221.68 for Singapore school children (17). To reduce the effect of astigmatism, the accuracy of refractive data correction needs to be continuously improved in clinical work. Therefore, optometrists or ophthalmologists pay attention to the balance between the eye\u2019s optics and cornea to minimize TA.\nThe strengths of this study were that we use Fourier analysis to transform refractive clinical data into vector notation, which considered both the magnitude and axis of astigmatism. Then, we identified the risk factors for children with full compensation, and identified the relationship between TA and UDVA. Unfortunately, we did not measure the contribution of the internal structure of the ORA (such as the anterior chamber depth, and thickness of the crystal, or lens tilt) to the TA. We were also unable to assess the contribution of PCA on TA due to the difficulty of measuring PCA. At last, the compensatory effect of ORA and ACA on visual\nFrontiers in Public Health 07 frontiersin.org\nacuity was also significantly correlated with other factors (such as higher-order aberrations, pupil size, accommodation, and cortical modulation of astigmatism). These factors could not be further investigated due to the limitations of epidemiological investigations. Long-term longitudinal data are needed to provide more convincing evidence due to the limitations of cross-sectional studies.\nIn conclusion, we found the related risk factors of full compensation. Children with full compensation had better UDVA and smaller TA. In order to reduce the impact of TA, an emphasis on astigmatism vector analysis or compensatory efficiency is required, especially in corneal altering procedures (such as refractive surgeries and orthokeratology lens fitting) or IOL lens implantation."
