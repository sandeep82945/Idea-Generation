Obviously, it is important in geometry, but it is also well known in topology, where a similar telescoping sum is known as the Euler characteristic of any finite space. The value of can also be computed for the unit polyhedra (such as the unit cell, the asymmetric unit or Dirichlet domain) which build, in a symmetric fashion, the infinite crystal lattices in all space groups. In this application has a modified form ( m) and value because the addends have to be weighted according to their symmetry. Although derived in geometry (in fact in crystallography), m has an elegant topological interpretation through the concept of orbifolds. Alternatively, m can be illustrated using the theorems of Harriot and Descartes, which predate the discovery made by Euler. Those historical theorems, which focus on angular defects of polyhedra, are beautifully expressed in the formula of de Gua de Malves. In a still more general interpretation, the theorem of Gauss\u2013Bonnet links the Euler characteristic with the general curvature of any closed space. This article presents an overview of these interesting aspects of mathematics with Euler\u2019s formula as the leitmotif. Finally, a game is designed, allowing readers to absorb the concept of the Euler characteristic in an entertaining way.\n1. Introduction\nTopology, broadly defined as the study of certain properties of geometric figures (or spaces) that do not change as these figures or spaces undergo continuous deformation, is a relatively young branch of mathematics, developed as a distinct field by Henri Poincare\u0301 (see the biographical notes in Appendix A) at the end of the 19th century. However, topologists usually associate the foundation of their discipline with Leonhard Euler (see Appendix A), whose famous formula relating the numbers of vertices, edges and faces of any three-dimensional polyhedron, V E\u00fe F \u00bc 2, is of fundamental importance in topology. This formula later became the basis of the concept of the Euler characteristic , which can be applied not only to polyhedra [more generally termed polytopes (for a definition see Appendix B)] but also to more unusual (to our senses) topological figures, such as spheres, toruses, strips etc. Roughly speaking, is defined as an alternating sum of the numbers of k-cells associated with a given figure, where 0-cells are equivalent to vertices, 1-cells to edges, and so on up to k = N, N being the dimension of the figure. Moreover, these concepts can be applied not only to finite objects, such as, e.g., the cube, but also to objects that extend in space infinitely. An excellent example of such an\nISSN 1600-5767\ninfinite topological object is a crystallographic lattice: periodic and infinite in three dimensions (or in any number N of dimensions, RN). It was the consideration of the crystallographic unit cell (as an object sharing its bounding elements, or k-cells, with its neighbors) and its minimal asymmetric part, the asymmetric unit (ASU), that some time ago made us realize that the Euler\u2019s formula for such \u2018incompletely bounded\u2019 figures will be different, yielding a sum that is smaller by 1 (Dauter & Jaskolski, 2020). This concept was extended, with proof, to the Euler characteristic, termed for such objects the modified Euler characteristic m (Naskre\u0328cki et al., 2021a). A completely general treatment of m based on the topological notion of orbifolds (Appendix B) (Naskre\u0328cki et al., 2021b) showed that these abstract topological ideas have very practical extension to crystallography.\nIn this paper we introduce in an accessible way the notions of the Euler characteristic and modified (multiplicityweighted) Euler characteristic in relation to crystallographic polyhedra, lattices and symmetry groups. Moreover, we show how the idea of m can be derived from some fundamental topological theorems, such as Harriot\u2019s theorem or Descartes\u2019 theorem. It is our goal to use the concept of the Euler characteristic to make topology more familiar, and useful, to crystallographers.\nThe article is constructed in such a way that sections that present cornerstone concepts are concluded with \u2018Take-home messages\u2019, which we hope the reader will have understood and will remember. As the finale, we have designed a game \u2018Let\u2019s compute Euler\u2019s number\u2019 which offers an entertaining way of absorbing the concept of the Euler characteristic."

            "text": "We start from a Euclidean space of a given dimension N. In such a space we will consider sets, called k-cells, which are topologically equivalent to closed balls of dimension k N. Such cells can be joined together to form new subsets, e.g. forming a rectangle from four edges (1-cells) that overlap at four vertices (0-cells).\nA k-polytope embedded in a Euclidean space of dimension N is a union of cells of dimensions ranging from 0 to k. In particular, a 2-polytope in R2 is usually called a polygon, while a 2-polytope in R3 is typically an empty \u2018skin\u2019 (polyhedron), consisting of flat faces joined at straight edges and point vertices. If the points inside the boundary of this \u2018skin\u2019 are also included in the definition of the object, it becomes a solid (a 3-polytope in R3), which formally also includes several 3-cells (interiors I). In this special case, the topological Euler characteristic of the solid equals one (V E\u00fe F I \u00bc 1). In particular, one might ask, what is the crystallographic unit cell? In the extreme case one might say that it is a skeleton of 12 edges of a parallelepiped and the faces do not matter. However, since the crystal unit cell is ultimately filled with concrete matter, atoms and molecules, most crystallographers would view the unit cell as a solid parallelepiped, with proper faces bounding the three-dimensional interior. In this view, the translationally repeated unit cells cover all points of the R3 space.\nDepending on the context, we will refer to a k-polytope (built from cells of dimensions between 0 and k) in RN for k N and call it k dimensional. The standard notation is to say that we have a polytope in RN , which denotes a solid Ndimensional polytope. We will always make the proper distinction because, as noted above, even the adopted definition influences the result of the sum in Euler\u2019s polyhedral formula and characteristic."

In Sections 3 and 4 we discuss the main properties and definitions of the Euler characteristic and its various generalizations.\nIn Section 5 we link the alpha and kappa worlds with the chi world via the fundamental result of Gauss (see Appendix A) and Bonnet (see Appendix A), which on the one hand connects the concept of curvature (kappa world) to the Euler characteristic for smooth surfaces, and on the other hand connects the total angular defect (Appendix B) (alpha world) to the same Euler characteristic in a polytopal analog of the Gauss\u2013Bonnet theorem.

In higher dimensions this generalizes to an angle between planes, hyperplanes etc. In various spaces the ensemble of angles in a certain polyhedron satisfies a list of restrictions. A particular relation holds in the planar triangle ABC. Its internal angles ffA; ffB; ffC satisfy the fundamental equality [Fig. 2(a)]\nffA\u00fe ffB\u00fe ffC \u00bc : \u00f01\u00de\nOne can generalize the statement above to the sphere. For this purpose, we consider geodesic arcs, i.e. arcs of the great circles, which have their center in the center of the sphere and radius equal to that of the sphere. Between three points (vertices) on a sphere that do not belong to a common arc, we can form three geodesic arcs (edges) which bound a region that we call a spherical triangle. In 1603 Thomas Harriot (see Appendix A) proved that a spherical triangle on the surface of a sphere satisfies a more general equalityP \u00bc F=r2; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere F is the area of the spherical triangle, r is the radius of the sphere onto which it is inscribed and the sum of the three\nspherical angles is P . The proof of Harriot\u2019s theorem is quite elementary and based on the concept of \u2018lunes\u2019 (Todhunter, 1886, pp. 72\u201373). In essence, every two great circles on a sphere that are not identical dissect the sphere into four regions or lunes [Fig. 2(b)]. Pairwise opposite lunes have\nthe same area F. It follows that F \u00bc 2 R2, where is the opening angle between the lunes. For a spherical triangle with vertices ABC, we consider the three pairs of lunes which are generated along pairs of arcs between vertices. Adding up the areas provides the formula given above. For a detailed version of the proof, see Hopf (1940).\nThe formula for a planar triangle as well as the formula of Harriot for a spherical triangle generalize to higherdimensional analogs of these figures. In three dimensions one has to take into consideration both the vertex angles and edge angles (Fig. 3). J.-P. de Gua de Malves (1783) gave the following formula:P\nP \u00fe 4 12 1 \u00bc 0; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere the first summation goes over all four triplanar angles at the four vertices of the tetrahedron, and the second summation is over biplanar angles at the six edges between all pairs of faces of the tetrahedron, as marked in Fig. 3. The contribution 4 12 corresponds to the four faces of the tetrahedron with their half spherical angles and the final 1 is the full angle corresponding to the interior of the tetrahedron. Notice the unusual convention: the values of range between 0 and 1 and correspond to the fraction of the area of the unit sphere that the angle subtends inside the tetrahedron. For we measure between 0 and 1 the fraction of the area of the unit sphere, centered at any point within the edge, that is cut out by\n156 Bartosz Naskre\u0328cki et al.

All 12 edges contribute a quarter of the surrounding space into the cube interior, 1j \u00bc 14.

All bounding elements of this tetrahedron lie at the special symmetric positions of this space group.

The edge 1\u20134 lies along a direction of 3m symmetry and sixfold multiplicity, the edges 1\u2013 2 and 3\u20134 lie along directions of 4mm symmetry and eightfold multiplicity, and the remaining edges 1\u20133, 2\u20133, 2\u20134 lie along directions of mm2 symmetry and fourfold multiplicity.

This concept is in principle related to a discrete form of curvature (more on this in Section 5 about the Gauss\u2013Bonnet theorem). An angular defect at a vertex is 1 minus the sum of the angles of the faces at that vertex. Here again we use the convention that the angles are normalized with respect to the measure of the given N-dimensional unit sphere. For N = 1 this measure is 2 , for N = 2 it equals 4 , and\nJ. Appl.

The Euler characteristic for teaching topology 157\nin general it is equal to the total surface of the N-dimensional sphere.\nFor example, at each vertex of the cube, all angles between the three pairs of faces meeting at each corner are equal to\n=2, i.e. 14 of the full planar angle 2 . The angular defect at each cubic vertex is therefore 1 3 14 = 14. The sum of the angular defects at all eight vertices adds up to 2.\nRene\u0301 Descartes (Appendix A) discovered [see the historical account by Federico (1982)] that the total sum of defects K\u00f0v\u00de at all vertices v of the boundary S of a 3-polytope P always satisfies P v K\u00f0v\u00de \u00bc 2: \u00f09\u00de\nWe note here that the value of 2 is equal to the Euler characteristic \u00f0S\u00de of the boundary of the polytope P, as fully explained in the next section. In (9) it is crucial that the boundary of the polytope P is topologically equivalent to a sphere [otherwise the value \u00f0S\u00de might change]. The notion of the Euler characteristic was of course not known to Descartes; his is, therefore, the true precursor of Euler\u2019s discovery.\nAccording to Hilton & Pedersen (1989) this formula is equivalent to the original Euler formula V E\u00fe F \u00bc 2. On the other hand, Descartes\u2019 theorem is a special case of the more general Gauss\u2013Bonnet formula. We will introduce this formula after the discussion of the Euler characteristic.\nDescartes\u2019 theorem has an interesting history. According to Gru\u0308nbaum & Shephard (1991), \u2018The elementary and beautiful theorem known as Descartes\u2019 Theorem was discovered in the seventeenth century and is stated in Descartes\u2019 De Solidorum Elementis. The manuscript was lost, however, and we only know of its contents because a copy made by Leibnitz was discovered in the Royal Library of Hanover in 1860. A transcription and translation of this manuscript, together with comments, can be found in Federico\u2019s (1982) fascinating account of the work.\u2019\nIn higher dimensions, Gru\u0308nbaum & Shephard (1991) found a generalization of Descartes\u2019 formula which still preserves the equality with the Euler characteristic. In their formulation they use a telescoping sum of all defects k of k-cells in an (N 1)-polytope P embedded into RN in which an intersection of any two (N 1)-faces is either empty or an (N 2)- face, forming altogether a polytope which is a topological manifold. The formula is\nPN 3 k\u00bc0 \u00f0 1\u00dek k \u00bc \u00f0P\u00de: \u00f010\u00de\nNote that 0 is the sum of defects at all vertices (0-cells), 1 is the sum of all defects at all edges (1-cells) etc. A nice example is an empty hypercube in dimension 4 (with cells up to dimension 3). It is a union of eight three-dimensional cubes, where four 3-cubes meet at each of the 16 vertices. The defect at each vertex is 1 4 18 \u00bc 12 since the solid angle at a vertex of a 3-cube is 18. Therefore, the defect 0 \u00bc 16 12 \u00bc 8. The hypercube has 32 edges, with three 3-cubes meeting at each edge. Hence the edge defect equals 1 3 14 \u00bc 14 since the angle between two faces of the 3-cube is 14. In total, we have\n1 \u00bc 32 14 \u00bc 8. We conclude, therefore, that the Euler characteristic of the empty hypercube (without the internal 4-cell) equals 0 1 \u00bc 0. This agrees with a general statement from topology that a 3-manifold has the Euler characteristic equal to zero.\nTake-home message. The total angular defect of a polytope is a quantity that, despite its very geometric origin, is a topological invariant."

However, the properties (i), (ii) and (iv) [without (iii)] determine other convex-continuous valuations (like volume integrals, surface integral etc.).\n(d) The Hausdorff metric used in property (iii) allows one to generalize the usual Euclidean distance between points to collections of multiple points (such as polytopes). We present in Fig. 4 two pairs of polytopes \u2013 two that are close in the sense of the Hausdorff metric [Fig. 4(a)], and two that are \u2018far apart\u2019 [Fig. 4(b)]. Continuity of a given function f with respect to the Hausdorff metric means that a small change in the value of the Hausdorff distance of two arguments (polytopes) implies a small change in the value of the function f against these arguments.\nProperties (i)\u2013(iv) allow us to design a game, \u2018Let\u2019s compute Euler\u2019s number\u2019 in Section 3.2. The rules are rather simple. We start from a given shape, which is our challenge. In each step\nall we can do is to decompose the shape into two parts for which we try to compute the Euler characteristic separately. Then we add these numbers and compute the Euler characteristic for all intersections of the pieces and apply the rules of alternating sum. There are two tricky aspects of the game: if the shape is polytopal, the game will always end (think about triangulation of the space); the result (value of the Euler characteristic) does not depend on the way we play a particular round. This surprising conclusion can be proven on the basis of either the combinatorial or topological formula for the Euler characteristic.\nCombinatorial definition of the Euler characteristic. Euler, Schla\u0308fli and Poincare\u0301 defined, at various levels of generality, the Euler characteristic of a polyhedral complex P as\n\u00f0P\u00de \u00bc Pn k\u00bc0 \u00f0 1\u00dekfk\u00f0P\u00de; \u00f015\u00de\nwhere f k\u00f0P\u00de denotes the number of k-cells of P. It is possible to check that the function defined in such a way satisfies principles (i)\u2013(iv).\nIn the most classical form, for a polyhedral surface S (e.g. a boundary surface, or \u2018skin\u2019, of a solid convex 3-polytope in R 3), if S has V vertices, E edges and F faces we have\n\u00f0S\u00de \u00bc V E\u00fe F: \u00f016\u00de\nIn particular, for such a polyhedral skin S of a solid convex\n3-polytope the celebrated Euler theorem is (Euler, 1758)\n\u00f0S\u00de \u00bc 2: \u00f017\u00de\nIn his wonderful book Richeson (2008) explores the many\nfacets of this remarkable formula.\nIn fact, formula (15) can be deduced from the properties (i)\u2013(iv) of as was shown by Klain & Rota (1997, Theorem 3.2.3). This means that the valuative definition of provided by Hadwiger, while being rather modern compared with the definitions of Euler, Schla\u0308fli and Poincare\u0301, is a much more natural point of departure for our discussion. Such an achronological state of affairs is not uncommon in mathematics.\nTopological definition of the Euler characteristic. The Euler characteristic can be extended to any topological space X. The meaning of \u00f0X\u00de in such a case is the alternating sum\n\u00f0X\u00de \u00bc P\ni\n\u00f0 1\u00deibi\u00f0X\u00de; \u00f018\u00de\nwhere bi\u00f0X\u00de denotes the ith Betti number of X and the summation index runs from 0 to the dimension of the space X. An ith Betti number of X is the number of i-dimensional \u2018holes\u2019 in X (Richeson, 2008, ch. 23; see also Hatcher, 2002; Spanier, 1982). The dimension of the \u2018hole\u2019 is related to its boundary, rather than its interior (a sphere bounds a ball-like hole etc.). A circle C bounds a disc-shaped hole, hence b1\u00f0C\u00de \u00bc 1. A sphere S bounds a ball but it has no disc-like hole, hence b1\u00f0S\u00de \u00bc 0, b2\u00f0S\u00de \u00bc 1. In the familiar context when X is a polytope P, the combinatorial and topological definitions of the Euler characteristic coincide. While the terms of the telescoping sums (15) and (18) are rather similar in appearance, they are not directly comparable. The Betti\nJ. Appl. Cryst.

The Euler characteristic for teaching topology 159\nnumbers bi\u00f0P\u00de of a polytope P cannot in general be deduced from the number of faces f i\u00f0P\u00de. For example, the Betti numbers of a polytopal skin of a convex polytope are always b0\u00f0P\u00de \u00bc 1, b1\u00f0P\u00de \u00bc 0, b2\u00f0P\u00de \u00bc 1, bi\u00f0P\u00de \u00bc 0, i> 2, while the numbers f i\u00f0P\u00de will vary with each polytope P.\nHowever, we note here that the valuative, combinatorial and topological definitions of the Euler characteristic do coincide for polytopes. That means we should recognize the quantity \u00f0P\u00de as something more fundamental than any of these three definitions."

            "text": "Homotopy equivalence (Appendix B) is a notion that was discovered during the formative years of mathematical\ntopology. The main idea of homotopy equivalence is to be able to \u2018bend one space into another\u2019. In essence, homotopy equivalence between two spaces X and Y preserves the essential topological features, such as path connectivity and the number of connected components.\nThis \u2018bending\u2019 is done with respect to very strict assumptions: the transformation that replaces one space by another is continuous, which intuitively means that we deform spaces without tearing them apart. So, we say that a subset of the Euclidean space X is homotopy equivalent to a subset Y if there exist two maps f : X ! Y and g : Y ! X , both continuous and such that their compositions f g and g f are homotopic (Appendix B) to the identity maps (an identity map is just sending an element to itself) on X and Y, respectively.\nIn particular, a space is homotopy equivalent to a point only if there exists a point within this space such that every other point is connected to it by a connected path (but sometimes this is not enough \u2013 see the example of the circle and a point at the end of Section 3.2). For example, any star-shaped polytope is homotopy equivalent to a point, and so is any convex subset. The necessary homotopy (Appendix B) is realized by moving each point onto a fixed point along a line which is contained within the space. In Fig. 5(a) we visualize how a point is homotopy equivalent to a bounded segment. The homotopy moves linearly each point of the segment onto one particular point of the segment. Similarly, in Fig. 5(b) we show how a polygon which consists of several connected segments is homotopy equivalent to a point. The homotopy \u2018shrinks\u2019 the branches in several stages. Finally in Fig. 5(c) we demonstrate how two paths on the plane with the same start and end points transform under homotopy into each other in a finite time t.\nFor two polytopes (not necessarily convex or connected) the homotopy equivalence between them will save the general connectivity between points but might even lower the dimension. Take a square with a smaller open square removed and a one-dimensional rectangular skeleton (a parallelogram) \u2013 they are homotopy equivalent, but definitely not rigidmotion equivalent. However, the Euler characteristic remains the same.\nWith the topological extension of we gain the extra flexibility of the homotopy invariance, \u00f0X\u00de \u00bc \u00f0Y\u00de if X is homotopy equivalent to Y. The topological extension of the definition of the Euler characteristic also satisfies the usual principles (i)\u2013(iv). In the first rule we can replace the rigid motion with any homotopy equivalence, and in principle (iii) the convex polytope can be replaced with any topological space that is homotopy equivalent to a point."

According to rule B1, since the filled square is convex, its Euler characteristic equals 1. Alternatively, we argue that there exists a linear motion, continuous from point to point, which moves each point of the filled square onto its center.\nJ. Appl. Cryst.

Let us consider a shape P2 that consists of a circle and an edge attached to this circle at one point B [Fig. 6(b)]. The shape P2 \u00bc [ is an empty lollipop. Rule C tells us that\n\u00f0P2\u00de \u00bc \u00f0 \u00de \u00fe \u00f0 \u00de \u00f0 \\ \u00de: \u00f020\u00de\nRule B1 informs us that \u00f0 \u00de \u00bc \u00f0B\u00de \u00bc 1, hence \u00f0P2\u00de \u00bc \u00f0 \u00de. For a trained topologist this is not surprising since every such \u2018hairy\u2019 circle is homotopy equivalent to a pure circle. So how do we compute \u00f0 \u00de? Well, a circle is a union of two closed half-circles and which intersect at the union of two points \\ \u00bc fA;Bg.

Game 3. Let us consider a rectangle with a smaller rectangle removed from its interior [Fig. 6(c)]. The position of the interior rectangle (as it will turn out) is not important. What is important is that we do not remove the inner boundary around the hole. From a topological point of view, this space is homotopy equivalent to an ordinary circle (in a sense, the flexibility of topology ruins the excitement of our game . . . ). So, the conclusion should be \u00bc 0: In the polygonal version, we can decompose the shape P3 into a union of four trapezoids T1 \u00bc ABFE, T2 \u00bc AEHD, T3 \u00bc CGFB, T4 \u00bc DHGC, with parallel sides corresponding to one outer and one inner edge of the hollow rectangle. Each trapezoid Ti satisfies \u00f0Ti\u00de \u00bc 1 since it is a convex shape. Pairwise neighboring trapezoids, say \u00bc T1 and \u00bc T2, have an edge \\ as their intersection, hence \u00f0 \\ \u00de \u00bc 1, according to rule B1. Let \u00bc T1 [ T2 and \u00bc T3 [ T4. It follows from rule C that \u00f0 \u00de \u00bc \u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 1.

Fig. 6(d) shows a square pyramid with a tunnel cut out at its bottom. We cut the original shape P4 into three convex pyramids ; ; , two of them ( ; ) connected along a face ( \\ \u00de. It follows from rule C that the Euler characteristic of the union P4 \u00bc [ [ satisfies \u00f0P4\u00de = \u00f0 \u00de \u00fe \u00f0 [ \u00de \u00bd \\ \u00f0 [ \u00de .\nRule B1 implies that \u00bd \\ \u00f0 [ \u00de \u00bc 1.

Now, our readers, equipped with such a powerful tool, are asked to try to compute the Euler characteristic of the following shapes:\n(1) A rectangle with two holes (of any shape). (Answer \u00bc 1.) (2) A torus surface (hint: cut the torus surface vertically into two bended tubes; argue that the Euler characteristic of such a tube is the same as for a circle; the intersection of these tubes is a union of two disjointed circles). (Answer \u00bc 0.) (3) A ball. (Answer \u00bc 1.) (4) A sphere.

(Answer \u00bc 1.) (6) A square pyramid as in Game 4, but with two perpendicular tunnels drilled at its bottom, running parallel to the base edges. (Answer \u00bc 1.) (7) A cube with a tunnel drilled through its center. (Answer\n\u00bc 0.) (8) A cube with two crossing tunnels drilled through its center. (Answer \u00bc 2.) (9) A cube with three crossing tunnels drilled through its center. (Answer \u00bc 4.) (10) Challenge: can you generalize the formula for a cube drilled with n tunnels meeting at one central point? [Answer:\n\u00bc 2 \u00f01 n\u00de.] We note that, in cases where for two spaces X and Y the Euler characteristic is different, these spaces are not homotopy equivalent. However, even when \u00f0X\u00de \u00bc \u00f0Y\u00de, it does not imply in general that such spaces are equivalent. A simple and fun proof (without any algebraic topology) that a circle is not equivalent to a point is provided by Brown (1974).\nTake-home message. The computation of the Euler characteristic of a polytope (or even of topological space) is a valuation process which measures the essential \u2018connectivity\u2019 properties of a given set. It is a natural, yet non-trivial, extension of the counting measure for finite sets, which remains finite for polyhedra."

            "heading": "4. The modified Euler characteristic",
            "text": "A typical object in crystallography is a polytope, such as the unit cell or its ASU, which is propagated through space by the action of a certain space-group symmetry. Such a construction provides a new point of view on the intrinsic geometry of the polytopes. Instead of studying a single solid polytope in space, for which the Euler characteristic equals 1, we need to take into account the possibility of vertices, edges and faces being shared by adjacent polytopes in the tessellation.\nTo fix that, one has to introduce a new principle of sharing. In this new \u2018modified Euler characteristic\u2019 ( m) concept we count the k-cells in the minimal space element (in crystallography, the ASU or Dirichlet domain) which is replicated under the space-group action, with the contribution of each k-cell normalized by a weight that is inversely proportional to the number of sharing neighbors, or by the fraction of the total solid angle around this k-cell subtended by the polytope in question. A quantity that will abstract from the particularities of the tessellation subdivision is termed the orbifold Euler characteristic (Appendix B), as introduced by Satake (1956) and Thurston (2002). We have investigated the concept of modified Euler characteristic in earlier papers (Dauter & Jaskolski, 2020; Naskre\u0328cki et al., 2021a) and in relation to the orbifold notion as well (Naskre\u0328cki et al., 2021b). The modified Euler characteristic has the form\n162 Bartosz Naskre\u0328cki et al. The Euler characteristic for teaching topology J. Appl. Cryst.

In three-dimensional space this can also be expressed as\nm \u00bc Vm Em \u00fe Fm Im \u00f027\u00de\nwhere Vm;Em;Fm; Im represent the total fractions of elements of different dimensionality ascribed to one polyhedron in the three-dimensional lattice (Dauter & Jaskolski, 2020; Naskre\u0328cki et al., 2021a).\nThe modified Euler characteristic is multiplicative with respect to coverings of the spaces. The tessellation by its periodic behavior corresponds to a space named the Ndimensional torus. Every torus is obtained by \u2018gluing\u2019 the appropriate cells. In particular, in dimension 2 we start from a filled square. We glue pairwise in the same orientation the two vertical edges, as well as the horizontal edges. In effect, this new space allows one to \u2018pass through the wall\u2019. The effect of crossing the northern boundary is to return to the southern border. A similar situation arises when crossing east to west. In three dimensions we identify and glue together the corresponding faces of the cube, to obtain a three-dimensional torus. In general, one can imagine a filled hypercube in dimension N, where we perform a compatible identification of the (N 1)-cubes. Such a torus maps onto a space which is an orbifold. This object looks locally like a polytope (or even an ASU) except for some special points at which the neighborhoods are rather unusual (Naskre\u0328cki et al., 2021b).\nTake-home message. The fundamental principle that emerges from the calculations of m is that for all space groups the modified Euler characteristic of the ASU equals 0.\nTherefore, the modified Euler characteristic of a periodic tessellation is a useful invariant of the tessellation. A practical computation of the modified Euler characteristic can be performed in a way that resembles the original Euler game. Each time we divide a k-cell along a (k 1)-cell, the latter inherits the weight of the former.\nBelow we present two examples of the computation of the\nmodified Euler characteristic.\nSpace group P3 example. In space group P3 the ASU recommended in International Tables for Crystallography, Volume A (Aroyo, 2016), is a prism with a pentagonal base [Fig. 7(a)]. Each of the three lower and three upper vertices lying at the threefold axes provides 16 of the total spatial angle inside the ASU, and the four remaining vertices provide 18 each of the total angle. The Vm value is therefore 6 16\u00fe 4 18 \u00bc 1 12. Each of the three vertical edges positioned along the threefold axes provides 13 of the total angle and the remaining 12 edges give 14 of that angle each. The total value is therefore Em \u00bc 3 13\u00fe 12 14 \u00bc 4. The seven faces give in total Fm \u00bc 7 12 \u00bc 3 12. With one full interior we get\nm \u00bc Vm Em \u00fe Fm Im \u00bc 1 12 4\u00fe 3 12 1 \u00bc 0: \u00f028\u00de\nSpace group P21 example. In space group P21 the ASU encompasses the lower half (0 y< 12) of the unit cell [Fig. 7(b)]. Every second horizontal planar angle at the ASU vertices has the monoclinic value of and the remaining vertices have the complementary angle . In effect, the average value of all these angles is =2, and the total internal spatial angle of all eight vertices is Vm \u00bc 8 18 \u00bc 1 (in analogy to the cube). All edges contribute in total Em \u00bc 12 14 \u00bc 3. The contribution of the six faces is Fm \u00bc 6 12 \u00bc 3. The resulting value is\nm \u00bc Vm Em \u00fe Fm Im \u00bc 1 3\u00fe 3 1 \u00bc 0: \u00f029\u00de\nOne can further note that the formula of de Gua de Malves is a special form of the modified Euler characteristic, which always takes the value of 0. When we replicate a given polyhedron through space, the vertices, edges and faces are appropriately shared among three-dimensional cells. The\nJ. Appl. Cryst.

The Euler characteristic for teaching topology 163\nweight with respect to which each k-cell is counted in the modified Euler characteristic formula corresponds to the fraction of the total angle that the given k-cell subtends from the full solid angle. That means that, in the context of polytopes that are replicated by space-group action, we can reinterpret the modified Euler characteristic in terms of angles rather than weighted counts of shared k-cells. The examples in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) perfectly illustrate this point."

            "text": "The formula of Harriot and its higher-dimensional analogs encode what modern mathematics calls the curvature around a point. In simple terms, a curvature (Gauss curvature) measures how the space \u2018bends\u2019 around a single point and quantifies it as a real number (negative, zero or positive). We can have positive curvature, e.g. of a point on a sphere. Zero curvature means that the space around a point is flat. For negative curvature things are somewhat upside down and spaces like that for a human standing at a particular point would look unnatural in the sense of revealing more of the horizon than expected. A saddle point is a good example of a place with negative Gaussian curvature (Richeson, 2008, ch. 21).\nThe measure of the curvature on a surface S can be used to express the total value of such a deformation.

This is in fact remarkable, because for other, more wobbly closed surfaces that are distortions of a sphere and can be treated as homotopy equivalent to it, the Gaussian curvature K will obviously change locally, leading to an extremely complicated integration problem. Yet, the final result is always the same, 4 in three-dimensional space.\nTake-home message. The total Gaussian curvature of a closed surface is a quantity that is independent of any small (i.e. continuous) deformations of this object. Its nature is purely topological.\nIn this paper we are mostly interested in the curvatures, angles, topological properties etc. of polyhedra and polyhedral\ntessellations of spaces. In particular, we need to develop and discuss the notion of the curvature for a space with edges and boundaries.\nFor a surface built out of two-dimensional polygons, the faces are flat, and hence their Gaussian curvature is 0.

            "text": "We have discussed many interesting connections between the alpha (angle), chi (Euler characteristic) and kappa (curvature) worlds. The key result that connects the three worlds is Descartes\u2019 theorem, which links the total angular defect with the Euler characteristic. While being a result about angles, it is the simplest variant of the Gauss\u2013Bonnet theorem for polytopes.\nThe formula of Harriot provides a link between the angle sums, Euler characteristic and modified Euler characteristic for tessellations of space. In higher dimensions such a comparison can be made via the theorem of Gram, as explained above.\nIn our rather elementary considerations throughout this paper, we have not discussed in detail that the modified Euler characteristic can be interpreted as the Euler characteristic of an orbifold space associated with the tessellation. A detailed discussion of this view of our topic is presented by Naskre\u0328cki et al. (2021b). This high-brow point of view makes it possible to prove in an elegant way that the modified Euler characteristic is zero for every tessellation in every Euclidean space, using only the multiplicativity of the Euler characteristic under coverings of spaces and the vanishing of the modified Euler characteristic for a simple cubical tessellation (which corresponds on the orbifold side to a wrapped torus space). The Gauss\u2013Bonnet theorem has its version for (twodimensional) orbifolds. Yet again, this establishes a connection\n164 Bartosz Naskre\u0328cki et al. The Euler characteristic for teaching topology J. Appl. Cryst. (2022). 55, 154\u2013167\nbetween counting angles in polytopes shared in the tessellation and the modified Euler characteristic.\nFinally, we note that the terms that appear under the sum signs in the modified Euler characteristic may be interpreted as the number of k-dimensional cells in the tessellation of space. More precisely, if we are given a certain space tessellation and we fix a vertex of a particular polytope as the center of this tessellation, then, growing with the sphere radius R, we obtain a counting function Nk\u00f0R\u00de which computes the number of k-dimensional cells which are strictly contained in or intersect a ball of radius R centered at this fixed vertex. Coxeter (Appendix A) (1948, ch. 4.8) studied such functions and observed that the leading term coefficients k [so that Nk\u00f0R\u00de \u00bc kRN \u00fe ] satisfy the formula P k\u00f0 1\u00de\nk k \u00bc 0 for the periodic tessellations (under certain simplifying conditions). We have explored this theme (Naskre\u0328cki et al., 2021b), proving that this formula is essentially the modified Euler characteristic of the orbifold associated with the tessellation."

            "text": "The notion of the Euler characteristic of a space, polyhedron etc. is a well established numerical quantity, known for many years in mathematics. Over the past five decades, due to advances in our understanding of topological and differential aspects of polytopes, several new variants of the Euler characteristic have been proposed. The first formulation of Euler was somewhat ahistorical to the following development and proved to be less fundamental than the combinatorially founded concepts introduced later.\nIn particular, the modern notion of an orbifold plays a key role in this development, as well as in modern applications driven by computer graphics. Also, a reformulation of the Gauss\u2013Bonnet equation combines the local differential input, expressed in the Descartes angular defect formula, with the global idea of the Euler characteristic of an orbifold space. Such a point of view sheds new light on the intricate relations between combinatorially computed data of polyhedra and tessellations. Our aim in this paper has been to make the crystallographic community aware of these modern notions and indicate their practical and very concrete nature, as well as the unexploited potential for applications in the computational and numerical aspects of crystallography.\nIn the general context, the many facets of the modified Euler characteristic reveal the unity and beauty of mathematics and crystallography, combining their many flavors: combinatorial, geometric and topological. We hope that interested readers will benefit from this unified exposition and will view the modified Euler characteristic as a versatile tool that allows the qualitative properties of various spaces to be measured."

            "text": "Pierre Ossian Bonnet (1819\u20131892) was a prolific mathematician and teacher of the 19th century. In his early life he\nconsidered a career as an engineer but he eventually turned to analysis and geometry. He taught at E\u0301cole Polytechnique and the Sorbonne in Paris, working at that time on several ideas in differential geometry. His interests were broad and included cartography, algebra and mathematical physics. In particular, he applied certain ideas from differential geometry to geographical maps, including an extension of Lambert\u2019s ideas about transformations which preserve angles on cartographic maps. His greatest contribution was the extension of the ideas of Gauss about curvature of surfaces and the proof of the Gauss\u2013Bonnet formula for a surface with boundary.\nHarold Scott MacDonald Coxeter (1907\u20132003) was a man of many talents. An accomplished pianist and a talented linguist, he finally chose mathematics as his master subject, much to the benefit of humanity. Educated in Cambridge, he spent some time at Princeton and returned to Trinity College where he was appointed as a lecturer. He became later a professor in Toronto. He made major contributions to the theory of polytopes, the study of reflection groups and tessellations of spaces.\nRene\u0301 Descartes (1596\u20131650) was a French philosopher and mathematician. He served for a while in the French and Dutch armies, but later he mostly lived in the Netherlands. He died from pneumonia in cold Sweden as a tutor of Queen Christina. With his famous maxim cogito ergo sum, he is regarded as the precursor of modern rationalistic philosophy, pioneering the \u2018Age of Reason\u2019. Descartes left an enduring legacy in mathematics. He introduced the Cartesian system of coordinates and algebraic methods for analyzing geometrical problems. Descartes was a prominent figure of the scientific revolution in the 17th century.\nLeonhard Euler (1707\u20131783) was one of the greatest and most prolific mathematicians of all time. Swiss by birth, he spent most of his life in Berlin and St Petersburg, where he is buried. He influenced many branches of mathematics, including calculus, analysis, number and graph theories, complex function theory, and topology. In crystallography Euler is remembered for his exp\u00f0i \u00de representation of complex numbers, for his theorem about the number of fivefold axes (12) in solids with icosahedral symmetry, or for his formula relating the number of vertices (V), edges (E) and faces (F) of any solid (V E\u00fe F \u00bc 2). His famous identity exp\u00f0i \u00de \u00fe 1 \u00bc 0 is considered the most beautiful formula ever.\nCarl Friedrich Gauss (1777\u20131855) is probably the greatest mathematician of all time, called \u2018Princeps mathematicorum\u2019; he very strongly influenced many branches of mathematics and science and tutored many famous mathematicians. Gauss was intellectually prodigious at a very young age. He studied at the universities at Braunschweig and Go\u0308ttingen, where he later lived. His most notable contributions were in number theory, geometry, probability, geodesy and astronomy. He contributed to important research on magnetism and his name is used as a unit of magnetic induction. Gauss left many important unpublished ideas, extending his influence throughout the 19th century.\nThomas Harriot (circa 1560\u20131621), in today\u2019s terms, was a scientist, mathematician and explorer. In 1585\u20131586 he was\nJ. Appl. Cryst. (2022). 55, 154\u2013167 Bartosz Naskre\u0328cki et al. The Euler characteristic for teaching topology 165\npart of the British Crown\u2019s expedition to the New World (called Virginia) to assess the economic value of the new colonies. Tasked with finding the best way of stacking cannonballs on ship decks, he discovered, without publication, \u2018Kepler\u2019s conjecture\u2019 approximately 20 years before Kepler, i.e. around 1591. Most of Harriot\u2019s discoveries and inventions are documented only in his sparse notes. The only published opus is on the exploration of the New World colony.\nHenri Poincare\u0301 (1854\u20131912) was educated at E\u0301cole Polytechnique in Paris and remains one of the very few mathematicians who understood the field in all its aspects. He made seminal contributions throughout mathematics, competing with Einstein in the discovery of the principles of general relativity. His foundational work in topology transformed the field completely, leading to further development of algebraic topology and making it possible to provide a topological definition of the Euler characteristic. He actively developed mathematical physics, in particular contributing to the qualitative understanding of the solutions of differential equations."
