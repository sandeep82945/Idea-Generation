1. **Investigate the use of glycopolymers for the targeted delivery of antiviral drugs.** Glycopolymers could be used to deliver antiviral drugs specifically to infected cells, thereby reducing the risk of side effects and improving the efficacy of treatment.


2. **Develop glycopolymers that can inhibit the attachment of viruses to host cells.** This could be achieved by designing glycopolymers that mimic the structure of the host cell receptors that the virus uses to attach.


3. **Explore the use of glycopolymers for the development of vaccines.** Glycopolymers could be used to present antigens to the immune system in a way that triggers a strong immune response. This could lead to the development of more effective vaccines against a wide range of viruses.


4. **Investigate the use of glycopolymers for the detection of bacteria and viruses.** Glycopolymers could be used to develop biosensors that can detect the presence of bacteria or viruses in a sample. This could be used for the rapid diagnosis of infections and for the monitoring of outbreaks.


5. **Explore the use of glycopolymers for the development of new antibacterial and antiviral materials.** Glycopolymers could be used to create materials that are resistant to bacterial and viral infection. This could be used to develop new medical devices, implants, and other products that are less likely to become contaminated with bacteria or viruses.
