    "abstractText": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic health problem that can be controlled by slowing one\u2019s carbohydrate metabolism by inhibiting \u03b1-glucosidase, an enzyme responsible for carbohydrate degradation. Currently, drugs for type 2 diabetes have limitations in terms of safety, efficiency, and potency, while cases are rapidly increasing. For this reason, the study planned and moved towards drug repurposing by utilizing food and drug administration (FDA)-approved drugs against \u03b1-glucosidase, and investigated the molecular mechanisms. The target protein was refined and optimized by introducing missing residues, and minimized to remove clashes to find the potential inhibitor against \u03b1-glucosidase. The most active compounds were selected after the docking study to generate a pharmacophore query for the virtual screening of FDA-approved drug molecules based on shape similarity. The analysis was performed using Autodock Vina (ADV)\u2014based on binding affinities (\u22128.8 kcal/mol and \u22128.6 kcal/mol) and root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) values (0.4 \u00c5 and 0.6 \u00c5). Two of the most potent lead compounds were selected for a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to determine the stability and specific interactions between receptor and ligand. The docking score, RMSD values, pharmacophore studies, and MD simulations revealed that two compounds, namely Trabectedin (ZINC000150338708) and Demeclocycline (ZINC000100036924), are potential inhibitors for \u03b1-glucosidase compared to standard inhibitors. These predictions showed that the FDA-approved molecules Trabectedin and Demeclocycline are potential suitable candidates for repurposing against type 2 diabetes. The in vitro studies showed that trabectedin was significantly effective with an IC50 of 1.263 \u00b1 0.7 \u03bcM. Further investigation in the laboratory is needed to justify the safety of the drug to be used in vivo.",

            "text": "Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder widely spread in developed countries, and has become a widespread and rising issue in these communities [1]. It is related to hyperglycemia and affects roughly 537 million people worldwide, accounting for 7.2% of the global population. Of all diabetic patients, more than 95% suffer from type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is the ninth leading cause of mortality, accounting for approximately 6.7 million deaths [2,3]. Type 2 diabetes is equally prevalent in all genders. Approximately 240 million people with diabetes are undiagnosed, and the global healthcare cost for diabetics was USD 966 billion in 2021 for adults aged 20\u221279 [4]. Poor diet, lack of physical activity, smoking, stress, ageing and oversleeping also increase the chances of diabetes [5]. Diabetic patients are more prone to health conditions, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cancer, heart failure, and stroke.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 555. https://doi.org/10.3390/ph16040555 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceuticals\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 555 2 of 20\nThe \u03b1-glucosidase enzyme found on the surface of the small intestine aids in carbohydrate digestion, producing glucose for intestinal absorption, which in turn leads to increased blood glucose levels. The inhibition of the \u03b1-glucosidase enzyme in patients with type 2 diabetes may reduce hyperglycemia; thus, the carbohydrate metabolism slows down. This study uses \u03b1-glucosidase as the target protein to predict drug candidates against it for inhibition. \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors should be safe and capable of decelerating glucose absorption, and consequently decreasing hyperglycemia [6]. Orally administered anti-diabetic drugs act through different mechanisms in controlling blood glucose levels. A combination of drugs has also been broadly used to increase treatment efficacy [7]. There are already some drug candidates against \u03b1-glucosidase used to treat type 2 diabetes. Hitherto, these drugs have absorptive problems, inhibit other non-intestinal proteins [8,9] and long-term side effects including cardiovascular diseases, liver disorders, hypoglycemia, lactate acidosis, and gastrointestinal complaints such as abdominal distension, diarrhea, and drug resistance [7,10]. Acarbose, Miglitol, and Voglibose maintain the glucose levels to slow down the digestion of carbohydrates, delay glucose absorption in the blood, and are used as first-line drugs for treating type 2 diabetes [11]. To deal with type 2 diabetes, these drugs bind to the carbohydrate-binding regions at \u03b1-glucosidases and delay oligosaccharides\u2019 cleavage to monosaccharides, and additionally help in reducing cardiovascular disorders and obesity [12,13]. Moreover, numerous drugs have been discovered in silico, with active biomolecules interacting with the target sites of complex molecular structures in the human body to obtain specificity and efficacy [14]. New effective \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors are highly required due to the side effects, safety, and absorptivity issues associated with currently available inhibitors. Notably, drug repurposing is gaining popularity as a quick and effective method of identifying new services of approved drugs unrelated to their original medical intent, and is successfully moving towards the second phase of clinical trials. In this study, we moved toward drug repurposing with computational methods of drug design, using FDA-approved drugs. We aimed to use this widespread approach and develop drug candidates against \u03b1-glucosidase for type 2 diabetes within a short period and at a reduced cost. As such, in early preclinical studies, lower failure rates will demonstrate the safety profiles of the rediscovered drugs."

            "text": "The structure of \u03b1-glucosidase consists of 874 amino acids with a molecular weight of 101.28 KDa, a theoretical PI of 5.29, an aliphatic index of 82.89, and a \u22120.137 grand average of hydropathy value (GRAVY). Figure 1 shows the domain architecture of \u03b1-glucosidase, which has three main domains and belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family. The first one is the cysteine-rich domain, which is approximately forty-five amino-acid residues long and is known as the \u2018P\u2019, \u2018trefoil\u2019, or \u2018TFF\u2019 domain, composed of three loop-like regions. The beta-barrel-like structure of the gal mutarotase N domain contributes to the construction of the receptor-binding site by donating a loop that comes into close contact with two regions of the catalytic domain, thus forming the site. Gal_mutarotase_2 is found N-terminal to the glycosyl-hydrolase domain and appears similar to the galactose mutarotase superfamily. Glyco_hydro_31 hydrolyses the glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates or between a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety. According to DeepLoc-1.0 and the ESLpred web server, \u03b1-glucosidase is an extracellular lysosomal protein. The expected accuracy of the ESLpred web server is approximately 75%, and the likelihood of DeepLoc1.0 is 0.3572 (Figure 2).\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 555 3 of 20Pharmaceuticals\u00a02023,\u00a016,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 3\u00a0 of\u00a0 22\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a01.\u00a0Domain\u00a0architecture\u00a0of\u00a0\u03b1-glucosidase\u00a0with\u00a0three\u00a0main\u00a0domains\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0glycoside\u00a0hydrolase\u00a0\nfamily.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a02.\u00a0Subcellular\u00a0localization\u00a0of\u00a0target\u00a0protein\u00a0via\u00a0DeepLoc-1.0\u00a0and\u00a0ESLpred\u00a0web\u00a0server.\u00a0\n2.2.\u00a0Protein\u00a0Structure\u00a0Refinement,\u00a0Optimization,\u00a0and\u00a0Minimization\u00a0 The\u00a0missing\u00a0residues\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0structure\u00a0of\u00a0\u03b1-glucosidase\u00a0were\u00a0filled\u00a0using\u00a0MODELLER.\u00a0 The\u00a0best\u00a0model\u00a0was\u00a0selected\u00a0and\u00a0then\u00a0minimized\u00a0by\u00a0two\u00a0servers,\u00a0Chiron\u00a0and\u00a0YASARA.\u00a0 We\u00a0chose\u00a0the\u00a0minimized\u00a0structure\u00a0from\u00a0Chiron\u00a0instead\u00a0of\u00a0YASARA\u00a0due\u00a0to\u00a0its\u00a0lower\u00a0energy.\u00a0The\u00a0total\u00a0clashes\u00a0and\u00a0clash\u00a0ratio\u00a0before\u00a0energy\u00a0minimization\u00a0were\u00a0771\u00a0and\u00a00.0433402.\u00a0 After\u00a0energy\u00a0minimization,\u00a0these\u00a0values\u00a0decreased\u00a0to\u00a0436\u00a0and\u00a00.0177079,\u00a0respectively.\u00a0Figure\u00a03\u00a0shows\u00a0the\u00a0protein\u00a0structure\u00a0with\u00a0highlighted\u00a0domains\u00a0in\u00a0different\u00a0colors.\u00a0The\u00a0RMSD\u00a0 values\u00a0between\u00a0the\u00a0original\u00a0structure\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0structure\u00a0after\u00a0filling\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0missing\u00a0residues\u00a0 is\u00a00.293,\u00a0indicating\u00a0a\u00a0high\u00a0degree\u00a0of\u00a0similarity\u00a0between\u00a0the\u00a0two\u00a0structures.\u00a0\nFigure 1.

Protein Struct e ent, Optimization, and Minimization\nThe missing residues in the structure of \u03b1-glucosidase were filled using MODELLER. The best model was selected and then minimized by two servers, Chiron and YASARA. We chose the minimized structure from Chiron instead of YASARA due to its lower energy. The total clashes and clash ratio before energy mi imization were 771 and 0.0433402. After energy minimization, these values decr ased to 436 and 0.0177079, respectively. Figure shows the protein structure with highlighted domains in different colors. The RMSD values between the original structure and the structure after filling in the missing residues is 0.293, indicating a high degree of similarity between the two structures. The PROCHECK analyses the stereochemistry of the target protein and generates a Ramachandran plot (Figure 4). According to the plot, 88.4% of residues are in the most favored regions, 11% in additional allowed regions, and 0.1% in generously allowed and disallowed regions.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 555 4 of 20\nPharmaceuticals\u00a02023,\u00a016,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 4\u00a0 of\u00a0 22\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a03.\u00a0Three-dimensional\u00a0structure\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0 target\u00a0protein\u00a0Alpha\u00a0Glucosidase\u00a0enzyme.\u00a0P\u00a0Terfoil\u00a0\ndomain\u00a0(TFF)\u00a0(2\u201356)\u00a0is\u00a0represented\u00a0in\u00a0pale-yellow\u00a0color,\u00a0Gal_mutarotase_N\u00a0(69\u2013176)\u00a0in\u00a0light\u00a0blue,\u00a0\nGal_mutarotase_2\u00a0 (178\u2013241)\u00a0 in\u00a0green,\u00a0Glyco_hydro_31\u00a0 (262\u2013746)\u00a0 in\u00a0 salmon,\u00a0and\u00a0Glyco_hydro_b\u00a0\n(627\u2013874)\u00a0in\u00a0cyan\u00a0color.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0PROCHECK\u00a0analyses\u00a0the\u00a0stereochemistry\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0target\u00a0protein\u00a0and\u00a0generates\u00a0a\u00a0 Ramachandran\u00a0plot\u00a0(Figure\u00a04).\u00a0According\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0plot,\u00a088.4%\u00a0of\u00a0residues\u00a0are\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0most\u00a0 favored\u00a0regions,\u00a011%\u00a0in\u00a0additional\u00a0allowed\u00a0regions,\u00a0and\u00a00.1%\u00a0in\u00a0generously\u00a0allowed\u00a0and\u00a0 disallowed\u00a0regions.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a04.\u00a0Ramachandran\u00a0plot\u00a0of\u00a0Alpha\u00a0Glucosidase,\u00a0which\u00a0represents\u00a0most\u00a0 favored\u00a0and\u00a0 favored\u00a0 regions\u00a0and\u00a0additional\u00a0allowed\u00a0regions.\u00a0\n2.3.\u00a0Reported\u00a0Inhibitors\u00a0Docking\u00a0and\u00a0Pharmacophore\u00a0Query\u00a0 The\u00a0target\u00a0protein\u2019s\u00a0binding/active\u00a0site\u00a0residues\u00a0are\u00a0LYS96,\u00a0ASP95,\u00a0ALA97,\u00a0PHE90,\u00a0 ILE98,\u00a0 THR99,\u00a0 CYS92,\u00a0ALA93,\u00a0ASP91,\u00a0 PRO94,\u00a0MET122,\u00a0 PRO125,\u00a0 GLN124,\u00a0 GLY123,\u00a0 PHE128,\u00a0TYR110,\u00a0and\u00a0CYS127,\u00a0as\u00a0labelled\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a05\u00a0[15].\u00a0\nFigure 3.

Site-specific docking was performed on 20 reported inhibitors [16\u201320] (acarbose, celgosivir, metformin, migalastat, 4-(4-methylbenzenesulfonyl)-N,N-diphenylpiperazine-1carboxamide, 1-Deoxynojirimycin, (6S,7R,8R)-Octahydro-indolizine-1,6,7,8-tetraol, miglitol, NAG, Voglibose, metformin, BGC, GLC, NOJ, (2R)_2alpha_Ethylpyrrolidine_3beta_4alpha_diol, SC2, GOL, PGE, PEG, EDO, and MIG) using PyRx. The most active compounds such as Celgosivir (60,734), 4-(4-methyl benzenesulfonyl)-N,N-diphenylpiperazine-1-carboxamide (1,322,817), and Voglibose (444,020) were analyzed and utilized for the pharmacophore query generation (Table 1). Flexible alignment was performed on the selected ligands to\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 555 5 of 20\ngenerate conformers, which helped identify the common features used to generate pharmacophore queries. Four essential features were chosen for pharmacophore query generation, such as hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA), hydrogen bond donor (HBD), hydrophobic, and aromatic groups, highlighted with different colors (Figure 6). This query was used for virtual screening to find similar compounds. The selected inhibitors have the capability to inhibit \u03b1-glucosidase activity, leading to decreased glucose release that slows down carbohydrate digestion and the absorption of glucose in the small intestine. This is a contemporary therapeutic approach for stabilizing blood glucose levels in diabetic patients, especially in type 2 diabetes.

The RMSD plots show the protein RMSD at the left Y axis and ligand RMSD at the right Y axis. Desmond takes the first frame as a reference frame, then aligns all protein frames on the reference frame\u2019s backbone and calculates the RMSD. The protein RMSD provides structural conformation throughout the simulation, while ligand RMSD provides ligand stability in the protein\u2019s binding pocket.

Nevertheless, the ligand remains in the binding site and stays stable for the rest of the simulation. No significant change in ligand RMSD indicates that the ligand did not leave the protein\u2019s binding pocket. The range of ligand fluctuations is higher than the protein due to numerous rotatable bonds in the ligand, but these are acceptable. In Figure 10B, at 15 ns, the protein is stable for the rest of the simulation within 2.0 to 2.4 \u00c5, while ligand RMSD is stable at 20 ns throughout the simulation within 1.6 to 6.4 \u00c5.

RMSF calculates individual residue flexibility during simulation. Due to more fluctuation, the residues at N- and C-terminals are free, and four peaks in the Figure 12A lower panel and one in 11 B show higher variations in the RMSF value, indicating coil or loop regions. In contrast, lesser fluctuation peaks show \u03b1-helices or \u03b2-sheets, and the areas with very minute fluctuations are binding site residues that are primarily conserved. Except for the higher loops, most residues of \u03b1-glucosidase maintain an RMSF value <2.5 \u00c5.

Molecular docking studies predicted the binding of the ligand under static conditions, while simulations predicted ligand binding under physiological conditions. The protein\u2013 ligand complexes were solvated with SPC explicit water molecules and placed in the center of an orthorhombic box of an appropriate size under the periodic boundary conditions. Protein\u2013ligand complexes were preprocessed, including optimization, equilibration, and minimization, using the Protein Preparation Wizard of Maestro default parameters. The system prepared using the system builder tool and OPLS 2005 force field was used in the simulation to describe molecular geometry [28]. During simulation, the models were neutralized to obtain the correct electrostatic values by adding counter ions such as Na+ or Cl\u2212 (0.15 M NaCl) to simulate the physiological conditions. Before starting the MD simulation, bad connections were eliminated, and the system\u2019s deformed geometries and steric clashes were repaired during the energy minimization step to avoid any significant steric overlap. In the minimization procedure, the entire system was allowed to relax for 2500 steps by the steepest descent approach. A temperature of 300 K with 1 atm pressure was maintained for 100 ns simulation. Before the simulation, the models were equilibrated. The equilibrated structure was used as a starting point, and a 100 ns long MD simulation was run. This phase is considered the production run. During the simulation, every 1000 ps of the actual frame was stored. The trajectories were saved for examination, and the stability of the complex was assessed by analyzing the results over time. MMGBSA analysis was performed for the two best compounds, Trabectedin and Demeclocycline, via Prime, a package of Schr\u00f6dinger [29]. This approach was used to determine the binding strength and stability of the protein and ligand, to predict the binding modes, and to differentiate between the binders and non-binders. The binding strength is determined by the binding free energy (\u2206Gbind) for proteins and ligands via Equation (1).\n\u2206Gbind = Gcomplex \u2212 Gprotein - Gligand (1)\n\u2206Gbind = \u2206Evdw + \u2206Eele + \u2206EGB + \u2206ESA \u2212 T\u2206S (2)\nAccording to Equation (2), the total binding free energy of protein and ligand is \u2206Gbind.

            "text": "\u03b1-glucosidase is considered an essential target for type 2 diabetes that is necessary to absorb digestive carbohydrates such as glucose and fructose and create hyperglycemic conditions. An average blood glucose level is required for the coordinated function of multiple tissues and organs. Reduced glucose synthesis and lower intestinal glucose absorption can reduce the severity of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, a library of FDA-approved compounds is used to find inhibitors against \u03b1-glucosidase, to control hyperglycemic conditions and act as a promising anti-diabetic compound with few or no side effects. Drug repurposing is a quick and low-cost method of discovering new modes of action for approved drugs for other diseases, and it was approved by both the FDA and EMA. In this study, a total of 1600 FDA-approved drugs were screened via an in silico approach to identify the candidate compounds showing anti-diabetic effects against \u03b1glucosidase. According to the results, Trabectedin and Demeclocycline, the two FDAapproved compounds, stably bind in the active site of \u03b1-glucosidase and show effective inhibition activities. Patients with type 2 diabetes commonly have an increased risk developing cancer and cardiovascular diseases. It is noteworthy that one of the lead compounds, Trabectedin, is a marine-derived antitumor agent and constitutes an FDA-approved treatment for soft tissue sarcoma. Moreover, with FDA approval, the second lead candidate, Demeclocycline, is used to treat Lyme disease, bronchitis, urinary tract infections, malaria, and bacterial infections. Implementing a bioinformatic approach to investigate FDA-approved drug molecules via a drug repurposing approach for treating type 2 diabetes is a valuable research technique that can reduce the cost and shorten the research time. In this study, molecular docking indicated the strong binding interactions of FDA-approved compounds with \u03b1-glucosidase, which showed stronger interactions than the standard inhibitors of the enzyme. The docking results were validated via an ROC curve. In the ROC curve, the graphical representation of the docking performance provided insights into the AUC which is used to measure test performance. There is an 82% chances that selected compounds are active rather than inactive. The two best selected compounds were also validated via a superimposition with a reference compound. Both the selected and reference compounds bind to the same position. The binding of these compounds was further confirmed through MD simulation studies. Trabectedin and Demeclocycline show potential for treating type 2 diabetes. In addition, the IC50 of trabectedin was found to be significantly lower with 1.263 \u00b5M. Moreover, only further actual in vivo experiments studies can elicit the potential of this FDA-approved drug for type 2 diabetes. Researchers have stated that anticancer drugs have a high risk of increasing diabetics as a side effect, where others have found that trabectedin is more effective in breast cancer patients with diabetics [31,32]. Based on these findings, a better structure\u2013activity relation (SAR) can be implemented to synthesize molecules with a higher activity and a probability of lowering the side effects.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 555 19 of 20\nAuthor Contributions: R.S.M.R. contributed to the planning, designing, screening, evaluation, validation, simulation, and writing of the article; S.T., A.A. and P.K. performed the data collection, data curation, and analysis; M.D. and B.A.-K., collected reported inhibitors built the pharmacophore, writing; H.I., supervision, writing\u2014review and editing.
