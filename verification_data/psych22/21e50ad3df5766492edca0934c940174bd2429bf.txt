"The present study has numerous strengths, including the use of a longitudinal study design, a large sample size, and the inclusion of Clubhouse members from six accredited Clubhouses in Canada. Despite these significant strengths, some limitations exist. First, the present study was unable to determine income outcomes during the pandemic, due to variation in participant reporting (e.g., members reporting COVID relief funds as income). This is an integral area of future research, as past qualitative studies have noted that due to the pandemic, Clubhouses will be 'forever changed' (Mutschler et al., 2021)."
