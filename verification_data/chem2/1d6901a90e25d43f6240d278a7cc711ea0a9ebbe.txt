"However, it is noteworthy that during the late period of cultivation, the intracellular RSS content of ∆adpA sharply decreased (Figure 2). This phenomenon suggests that AdpA might not be the only regulator controlling thioredoxins expression or that the removal of RSS is due to other factors other than thioredoxins. Further studies are thus required to elucidate the cause of this abrupt decrease of the RSS content in the ∆adpA mutant."
