            "text": "The plasma-assisted catalytic synthesis of ammonia has a potential as a reservoir and a carrier of electric power delivered from distributed power sources such as windfarms and solar cells. The potential of the ammonia synthesis is related with the fact that the conventional Haber\u2013Bosch process needs plant-level equipment and is not suitable to the distributed systems. In general, the first and rate-limiting step for the catalytic synthesis of ammonia is believed to be adsorption of nitric species on the catalyst surface. It has been considered that atomic nitrogen, which is produced in plasma by electron impact dissociation of molecular nitrogen, is the principal species for the adsorption in the plasma-assisted catalytic synthesis [1\u20133].\nMolecular nitrogen has a dissociation energy of 9.7 eV [4]. Because of the high\ndissociation energy, the production of atomic nitrogen by electron impact dissociation of molecular nitrogen is inefficient even in plasmas with electron temperatures of 3-4 eV, since only a fraction (\u223c 10%) of electrons has kinetic energies exceeding the dissociation energy. Some researchers point out the usefulness of dissociative recombination of N+2 (N + 2 + e \u2192 N+N) [5\u20138]. However, this process has a large rate coefficient at an\nelectron temperature less than 1 eV [9\u201311], indicating that ordinary ionizing plasmas cannot utilize this process for the production of atomic nitrogen.\nRecently, vibrational excited states of molecules at the electronic ground states\nattract much attention. It is believed that dissociation via vibrational excited states improves the efficiency of CO2 splitting using plasmas [12\u201316]. In addition, it is pointed out that vibrational exited states can work as another species which have high adsorption probabilities on catalyst surfaces. The enhanced adsorption probability is believed to be obtained by the consumption of the vibrational energy for overcoming the activation energy of chemisorption. The enhanced chemisorption has been already reported in CH4-Ni(100) [17], D2-Cu(111) [18], N2-noble metals [19\u201321], and CO2-Cu systems [22]. If vibrational excited states of molecular nitrogen work effectively for the enhancement of the chemisorption probability, they may improve the energy efficiency of plasmaassisted catalytic synthesis of ammonia, since electrons with low kinetic energies can participate in the vibrational excitation.\nThe production and loss processes of radicals and atomic species in plasmas have\nbeen investigated rather intensively in the history of the reactive plasma research. This is because the interaction between radicals and solid-state surfaces has direct applications in the processing of thin films such as etching and deposition. In contrast, the investigation of the kinetics of vibrational excited states is remarkably insufficient in comparison with radicals. This may be partly because the gas reforming reactions mentioned above are the first realistic applications of vibrational excited states. However, thanks to the expectation for the reaction processes driven by vibrationally excited molecules, recently, experimental investigations on the fundamental aspects of vibrational kinetics in plasmas have made great progress with the help of sophisticated diagnostics [23\u201330].\nThe objective of the present work is to give an understanding on the kinetics of\nvibrational excited states (or the vibrational temperature) of molecular nitrogen. In particular, we focus on the importance of the electron temperature. Several authors have reported both the electron (or excitation) temperature and the vibrational temperature in plasmas at low [31], medium [32], and atmospheric pressures [33]. We can find the positive correlations between the electron and vibrational temperatures in their papers, where the electron temperatures are higher than 0.5 eV and the plasmas are at ionizing states. In this work, we employed a helicon-wave plasma source to produce helium and argon-based plasmas. The major part of the helium plasma was at a recombining state with an electron temperature of approximately 0.1 eV, whereas the argon-based plasma was at an ordinary ionizing state. The rate coefficient of the electronic excitation is negligibly small and the vibrational excitation is only the excitation process in the helium plasma, whereas both the electronic and vibrational excitations are possible in the ionizing argon-based plasma. By comparing the results obtained using the two plasmas, we have shown the importance of the ultralow electron temperature to realize a high vibrational temperature of molecular nitrogen."

It was possible to generate a high-density plasma by applying an rf power of 3kW at 13.56 MHz to a helical antenna wound around a quartz tube with an inner diameter of 16 mm. The quartz tube was attached to a stainless-steel chamber, and the plasma produced in the quartz tube was transported to the downstream area. The discharge gas was pure helium or argon with the small addition (5%) of helium. The discharge gas was introduced into the upstream side of the plasma source. The pressure and the flow rate of helium in the helium discharge were 180 mTorr and 200 sccm, respectively, whereas they were 200 mTorr and 200 sccm in the argon-based discharge. The pressure of the argon-based gas was adjusted by reducing the evacuation speed using a gate valve. The plasma source had a uniform magnetic field of 550 G along the cylindrical axis.\nThe background of the present work was the synthesis of ammonia from the mixture\nof N2 and H2. The mixture of N2 and H2 was introduced into the downstream side of the stainless-steel chamber. To avoid the backward flows of N2 and H2 toward the upstream plasma, the stainless-steel chamber was divided into the upstream and downstream sides by placing an orifice with a diameter of 16 mm. The pressures of helium and the argon-based gas in the downstream side were 135 and 105 mTorr, respectively. The larger difference between the pressures of the argon-based gas in the upstream and downstream sides was due to the higher pumping speed of argon than helium. The lower pressure of the argon-based gas was necessary for the similar transports of the helium and argon-based plasmas to the downstream side. The nozzle for introducing the mixture of N2 and H2 was located at an axial distance of 5 cm from the orifice and at a radial distance of 15 cm from the cylindrical axis. The downstream side of the chamber was connected to a turbomolecular pump with a pumping speed of 1000 L/s. The negligible backward flows were confirmed by observing negligible optical emission intensities of molecular nitrogen and atomic hydrogen in the upstream side. The flow rates of both N2 and H2 were 20 sccm, which corresponded to the partial pressures of 3.0 and 2.6 mTorr, respectively, in the helium plasma, whereas they were both 0.5 mTorr in the argon-based plasma. The different partial pressures of N2 and H2 were caused by the different pumping speeds in the helium and argon-based plasmas. The partial pressures were determined using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) attached at port (B) in Fig. 1. We installed QMS in another vacuum chamber, and the QMS chamber was connected to the plasma chamber via an orifice with a diameter of 0.5 mm. The QMS chamber was differentially evacuated using another turbomolecular pump. The purpose for adding helium into argon was to calibrate the sensitivity of QMS. The measurements of various plasma parameters were carried out basically at the position where the mixture of N2 and H2 was introduced (port (A) in Fig, 1)."

The scattered laser light which passed through port (A) was focused onto an optical fiber, and the optical fiber guided the scattered laser light to a triple-grating spectrograph (TGS) [35]. The stray laser light, whose wavelength was not shifted from the incident laser wavelength, was eliminated by the Rayleigh block in TGS. The scattered laser light transmitted through TGS was detected using a charge-coupled device camera with a gated image intensifier (ICCD camera). The scattered laser light was accumulated on the ICCD camera for 4000 laser shots. The spectrum of the scattered laser light was approximated by a Gaussian function, and the electron temperature and the electron density were evaluated from the width and the amplitude of the Gaussian function, respectively [36].

The sensitivity of the spectroscopic system, which was composed of an optical window, a lens, an optical fiber, a CzernyTurner spectrograph, and an ICCD camera, was calibrated using a tungsten standard lamp and a deuterium standard lamp to obtain the absolute emission coefficients (the numbers of photons emitted per unit volume and unit time) [12].

The absolute densities of the p3D states of helium were utilized to estimate the electron density and the electron temperature of the helium plasma at the recombining state. The detailed method for estimating the electron density and the electron temperature from the densities of He(p3D) has been described in a previous paper [12]. The measurements of the N2(B 3\u03a0g) and N2(C 3\u03a0u) densities were carried out at port (A).

The QMS chamber was positioned at port (A) and the sampling orifice was inserted into the plasma column when measuring the N density and the vibrational temperature. The electron beam energy of the QMS filament was varied between 10 and 50 eV. Since the threshold electron energies for N + e \u2192 N+ + 2e and N2 + e \u2192 N+ +N+ 2e are 15.6 and 24.3 eV, respectively, the QMS signal at m/z = 14 comes only from the former reaction if the electron energy is adjusted between the two threshold energies [40]. The absolute density of atomic nitrogen was obtained from the ratio of the QMS signals and the cross sections of the two ionization processes. On the other hand, we estimated the vibrational temperature of molecular nitrogen from the threshold ionization curve (the relationship between the QMS signal and the electron energy) at m/z = 28. The principle of the estimation of the vibrational temperature is the shift of the threshold ionization curve due to the vibrational excitation. The details of the threshold ionization mass spectrometry for estimating the vibrational temperature have been reported in a separate paper [41]. We believe that the sampling and transport processes in the QMS measurement did not affect the vibrational temperature, since a collisionless condition was realized in the QMS chamber with the differential pumping and the surface deactivation coefficient of N2(X 1\u03a3+g , v) is rather small (< 10 \u22123) [42]."

The Zeeman splitting in the magnetic field of 550 G made the absorption spectra complicated, but we obtained the densities of the metastable states from the wavelength-integrated absorption with the help of the knowledge on the transition probabilities [43]. The temperatures of He(23S1) and Ar(4s 2[3/2]o2) were estimated by fitting the absorption spectra with the superpositions of Zeeman-split lines with Doppler broadening.

            "text": "Figure 2 shows the spectrum of laser Thomson scattering observed in the helium plasma. The intensity of rotational Raman scattering of molecular nitrogen was negligible in comparison with Thomson scattering because of the low N2 partial pressure (0.5-3 mTorr). Although the hatched wavelength region (\u2206\u03bb \u2264 0.55 nm) was masked by the Rayleigh block in TGS, we detected the light intensity in the masked region due to the huge stray light. The signal-to-noise ratio in the unmasked region is quite low, but we fitted the spectrum by a Gaussian function, as shown in Fig. 2. We employed the data at 0.55 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 2.5 nm for the fitting since the signal-to-noise ratio at \u03bb > 2.5 nm was too low. According to the width of the Gaussian function, we evaluated Te = 1.6 \u00b1 0.2 eV for the electron temperature. The electron density was evaluated from the amplitude of the Gaussian function, and it was ne = (6.0 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 1018 m\u22123. Note that these values were the electron temperature and the electron density on the cylindrical axis.\nFigure 3(a) shows the optical emission spectrum of the helium plasma, where the\nvertical axis is given by the absolute emission coefficient. We assumed 10 cm for the line-of-sight for deducing the emission coefficient from the optical emission intensity. As indicated in the figure, the emission lines were assigned to the 23Po\u2212p3D, 23Po\u2212p3S and 21S\u2212p1Po transitions of helium [44,45]. We detected the optical emission lines from Rydberg states with p \u2264 16. Since it is impossible to observe the optical emissions from the Rydberg states in an ionizing plasma [46, 47], the optical emission spectrum shown in Fig. 3(a) indicates that the helium plasma is at the recombining state and the Rydberg states are produced by three-body recombination He+ + e + e \u2192 He\u2217 + e.\nThe population densities of electronic excited states of helium are plotted in\nFig. 3(b) as a function of the ionization potential. As has been described in our previous papers [12, 46], the collisional-radiative model tells us that the population distribution of Rydberg states is approximated by the Saha-Boltzmann equation when the plasma is at the recombining state [44, 45]. The Saha-Boltzmann fitting is possible for the population distribution at 9 \u2264 p \u2264 14 in the data shown in Fig. 3(b), and the electron temperature and the electron density were evaluated from the slope and the intercept to be Te = 0.10 \u00b1 0.02 eV and ne = (6.0 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 1018 m\u22123, respectively. The electron density evaluated by the Saha-Boltzmann fitting agreed with that measured by laser Thomson scattering. However, we found the significant difference between the electron temperatures measured by laser Thomson scattering and the Saha-Boltzmann fitting.\nThe discrepancy between the electron temperatures measured by laser Thomson\nscattering and the Saha-Boltzmann fitting was attributed to the difference in the observation position. A photograph of the helium plasma is shown in Fig. 4(a), which was taken using a consumer-grade digital camera from the radial direction when N2 and H2 were not introduced into the downstream-side chamber. As shown in the figure, the helium plasma had a radial structure. The color of the plasma in the central region was orange. The same orange plasma was observed in the quartz tube, indicating that the plasma in the central region was at the ionizing state. On the other hand, the color of the plasma in the outside region was pink, as shown in Fig. 4(a). It is noted here that the optical emission spectrum shown in Fig. 3(a) was obtained by the lineof-sight measurement along the radial direction. Therefore, it is understood that the electron temperature of Te = 1.6 eV, which was measured by laser Thomson scattering, represented the value in the central region, and Te = 0.1 eV, which was evaluated by the optical emission spectroscopy, represented the value in the outside region. Note that the volume of the outside region is eight times greater than that of the central region. Hence, the major part of the helium plasma had an ultralow electron temperature of approximately 0.1 eV.\nThe electron density in the argon-based plasma was estimated to be\nne = (8.0\u00b1 0.8)\u00d7 1017 m\u22123 by referring to the ion saturation current of the Langmuir probe and the electron density of the helium plasma. The electron temperature in the argon-based plasma at the position of port (A) was unknown, since the Thomson scattering signal was below the detection limit and the relationship between the voltage and the current of the Langmuir probe was distorted by the magnetic field and the fluctuation at the frequency of the rf power [37,38]. However, it was possible to detected the Thomson scattering signal in the upstream side just above the orifice. The electron temperature evaluated from the Thomson scattering spectrum was T e = 1.7\u00b1 0.2 eV. Therefore, we speculated that the electron temperature of the argon-based plasma at the position of port (A) was similar to the electron temperature in the central part of the helium plasma. As shown in Fig. 4(b), we observed no anomalous radial transport of the argon-based plasma. By considering the electron density of ne = 8\u00d7 1017 m\u22123 and by referring to the general knowledge that the recombining states are rarely observed in\nargon plasmas [48,49], it was estimated that the entire part of the argon-based plasma was at the ionizing state."

The magnitudes of the shift were assumed to be equal to the vibrational energies. We assumed a Boltzmann distribution at a vibrational temperature Tv, and we calculated the threshold ionization curve which was expected at the vibrational temperature.

Therefore, it was estimated that the He(23S1) and Ar(4s 2[3/2]o2) densities at the flow rate of 20 sccm were much lower than the detection-limit densities. On the other hand, the temperatures deduced from the Doppler broadening widths were 550 \u00b1 50 K for both He(23S1) and Ar(4s2[3/2]o2), and they were independent of the flow rates of N2 and H2. We assumed that the temperatures of He(23S1) and Ar(4s 2[3/2]o2) represented the gas temperatures in the helium and argon-based plasmas, respectively."

The most remarkable peculiarity is that the vibrational\ntemperature of molecular nitrogen in the helium plasma was higher than that in the argon-based plasma, even though the electron temperature was ultralow. To our knowledge, the vibrational temperature that is higher than the electron temperature is rare to observe. In addition, the densities of electronic excited states of molecular nitrogen and the density of atomic nitrogen were also higher in the ultralow-temperature helium plasma.

Production processes of N2(B 3\u03a0g), N2(C 3\u03a0u), and atomic nitrogen\nThe higher N, N2(B 3\u03a0g), and N2(C 3\u03a0u) densities in the helium plasma are considered to be in connection with the higher vibrational temperature. As shown in Table 1, the N2(B 3\u03a0g) and N2(C 3\u03a0u) densities in the helium plasma were two orders of magnitude higher than those in the argon-based plasma. The production rates of N2(B 3\u03a0g) and N2(C 3\u03a0u) by electron impact excitation are proportional to the product of the electron density and the density of N2(X 1\u03a3+g ). Even if we consider the fact that the central part of the helium plasma is an ionizing plasma which has a higher electron density than the argon-based plasma, the significantly higher densities of N2(B 3\u03a0g) and N2(C 3\u03a0u) in the helium plasma cannot be explained only by electron impact excitation. Figure 8 shows the rate coefficients of electron impact excitation for molecular nitrogen as a function of the electron temperature. The rate coefficients were calculated on the basis of the cross section data available in the LXCat database [50]. As shown in the figure, the rate coefficients for producing N2(B 3\u03a0g) and N2(C 3\u03a0u) by electron impact excitation of N2(X 1\u03a3+g ) are steep functions of the electron temperature, and they are negligibly small at an electron temperature of 0.1 eV. Therefore, the production rates of N2(B 3\u03a0g) and N2(C 3\u03a0u) by electron impact excitation are negligible in the recombining plasma in the outside region. Another possible production process of N2(C 3\u03a0u) is the resonant energy transfer from argon metastable states to N2(X 1\u03a3+g ). However, the rate of this reaction is negligible in comparison with electron impact excitation, since its rate coefficient is 4 \u00d7 10\u221220 m3/s [51] and the Ar(4s2[3/2]o2) density (< 3 \u00d7 1015 m\u22123) is lower than the electron density.\nA possibility for the additional productions of N2(B 3\u03a0g) and N2(C 3\u03a0u) is the\ncontribution of vibrational excited states. The productions of electronic excited states of molecular nitrogen have been observed in the spatial afterglow of nitrogen plasmas, and simulation works have pointed out the contribution of vibrational excited states [52\u201355]. Examples of the reaction processes are\nN2(X 1\u03a3+g , v \u2265 39) + N \u2192 N2(A3\u03a3+u ) + N, (2)\nN2(X 1\u03a3+g , 5 \u2264 v \u2264 14) + N2(A3\u03a3+u ) \u2192 N2(B3\u03a0g) + N2, (3)\nand\nN2(A 3\u03a3+u ) + N2(A 3\u03a3+u ) \u2192 N2(C 3\u03a0u) + N2. (4)\nThe highly excited vibrational states, which are necessary in these reactions, are produced by the V-V (vibration-vibration) transition,\nN2(X 1\u03a3+g , v) + N2(X 1\u03a3+g , w) \u2192 N2(X1\u03a3+g , v + 1) + N2(X1\u03a3+g , w \u2212 1). (5)\nSince the vibrational temperature of molecular nitrogen in the helium plasma is higher than that in the argon-based plasma, as shown in Table 1, it is possible to expect a higher rates for the V-V transition in the helium plasma. In addition, the production processes of atomic nitrogen via vibrational excited states\nN2(X 1\u03a3+g , 10 \u2264 v \u2264 25) + N2(X1\u03a3+g , 10 \u2264 w \u2264 25) \u2192 N2 +N+N (6)\nN2(X 1\u03a3+g , 14 \u2264 v \u2264 19) + N2(A3\u03a3+u ) \u2192 N2 +N+N (7)\nmay explain the higher N density in the helium plasma. Note that the assumption of the Boltzmann distribution in deducing the vibrational temperature from the threshold ionization curve does not contradict the importance of the V-V transition. The maximum shift of the threshold ionization curve shown in Fig. 6(a) is approximately 1 eV, corresponding to the detection of N2(X 1\u03a3+g , v = 3). The V-V transition distorts the population distribution at high vibrational quantum numbers, but the deviation from the Boltzmann distribution is not significant at v \u2264 3 even if the V-V transition is active."

            "text": "The principal point to be discussed is the mechanism for the higher vibrational temperature in the helium plasma. The kinetics of vibrational excited states is basically governed by the e-V (electron-vibration), V-T (vibration-translation), and V-V transitions, and in addition to them, other chemical reactions participate in the kinetics. As shown in Fig. 8, the rate coefficient of electron impact vibrational excitation at an electron temperature of 1.7 eV is three orders of magnitude higher than that at 0.1 eV. Therefore, the argon-based plasma has the advantage in the e-V transition in comparison with the helium plasma. Since the gas temperatures are similar in the helium and argonbased plasmas, as shown in Table 1, the V-T transition does not result in the difference in the vibrational temperature. The rate of the V-V transition may be higher in the helium plasma because of the higher partial pressure of nitrogen. However, the V-V transition mainly affects the kinetics of highly excited vibrational states, and it may not explain the difference in the vibrational temperatures (or the population distribution at small v).\nAs mentioned above, the production processes of vibrational excited states in the\nhelium plasma cannot be more efficient than those in the argon-based plasma. Hence, we have speculated that the destruction frequency of vibrational excited states is lower in the helium plasma. The electron impact excitation to electronic excited states can\nwork as a destruction process of N2(X 1\u03a3+g ,v). For example, Fig. 9 shows the estimated rate coefficient of\nN2(X 1\u03a3+g , v) + e \u2192 N2(B3\u03a0g) + e (8)\nas a function of the electron temperature. Since the cross section of this reaction is available only for v = 0, we assumed the same cross section for N2(X 1\u03a3+g ,v) except the shift of the threshold energy when calculating Fig. 9. The magnitude of the shift was assumed to be equal to the vibrational energy. Since the rate coefficient increases with v, as shown in Fig. 9, reaction (8) may disturb the progress of the vibrational excitation or the increase in the vibrational temperature in the argon-based plasma with the electron temperature of 1.7 eV. In contrast, in the helium plasma with the ultralow electron temperature of 0.1 eV, the rate coefficient of reaction (8) is still negligible for higher vibrational states, resulting in the high vibrational temperature. We have proposed the same mechanism to explain more efficient CO2 splitting via vibrational excited states in the plasma with an ultralow electron temperature [12]."

            "text": "In this paper, we reported the comparison between plasma parameters in a recombining helium plasma and an ionizing argon-based plasma. The major part of the helium plasma had an ultralow electron temperature of 0.1 eV, whereas the electron temperature of the argon-based plasma was 1.7 eV. We observed a higher vibrational temperature in the helium plasma (0.34 eV) than the argon-based plasma (0.18 eV). The higher vibrational temperature promoted the V-V transitions of molecular nitrogen, resulting in the higher densities of N2(B 3\u03a0g), N2(C 3\u03a0u), and atomic nitrogen. Since the rate coefficient of electron impact vibrational excitation is higher in the ionizing argon-based plasma, we have estimated that the destruction frequency of vibrational excited state is a key for the higher vibrational temperature in the helium plasma. The process we have proposed is electron impact excitation of N2(X 1\u03a3+g ,v). The rate coefficient of this reaction is negligible even for vibrational excited states at the electron temperature of 0.1 eV, whereas it can work as a destruction process at 1.7 eV especially for highly excited vibrational states. It has been shown by the present work that a high-density plasma with a ultralow electron temperature is useful to obtain a high vibrational temperature and to promote reactions driven by vibrational excited states."
