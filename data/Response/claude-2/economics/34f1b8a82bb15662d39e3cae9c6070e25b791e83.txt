 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming:

1. Examine how the information quantity of a painting interacts with the artist's reputation to affect price. Does a high-information painting by a famous artist command an even higher premium?

2. Apply the SVD entropy measurement to other art forms like sculptures, photographs, etc. and test its effect on pricing in those markets.

3. Conduct lab experiments to see if viewers aesthetically prefer paintings with higher SVD entropy and if that matches with higher willingness to pay. 

4. Extend the analysis to the primary art market by obtaining data on prices of paintings sold by galleries. Test if similar results hold in that segment.  

5. Explore alternate information theory-based measurements beyond SVD entropy, such as mutual information between segments of the painting, to capture additional aspects of information.
