Samani, MD\nT elomeres are protective caps at the end of chromo-somes that progressively shorten with each celldivision.1-3 When telomeres reach a critical length, cells enter senescence; hence, telomere length is a marker of cellular replicative capacity and history.2 At the population level, there is a considerable interindividual variation in mean telomere length, usually measured in leukocytes (leukocyte telomere length [LTL]) but also present in other tissues.3 In epidemiological studies, we and others have shown that shorter LTL is associated with risk of incident coronary artery disease (CAD) as well as heart failure (HF).4-6 Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses have strongly suggested that the association of shorter LTL with CAD is genetically causal, although evidence for an association with HF is less certain.4 Cardiac imaging measurements, such as left ventricular mass (LVM), are intermediary phenotypes whose variability has also been shown to influence adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including CAD and HF.7 Two previous studies have investigated the association of LTL with LVM.8,9 The first by Vasan et al8 investigated 850 Framingham Heart study participants, and the second by Kuznetsova and colleagues9 examined 334 volunteers from the Flemish Study on Environment, Genes and Health Outcomes. Both studies used the LVM estimated by measurements from M-mode echocardiography and reported a\nIMPORTANCE Longer leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is associated with a lower risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. The extent to which variation in LTL is associated with intermediary cardiovascular phenotypes is unclear.\nOBJECTIVE To evaluate the associations between LTL and a diverse set of cardiovascular imaging phenotypes\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This is a population-based cross-sectional study of UK Biobank participants recruited from 2006 to 2010. LTL was measured using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Cardiovascular measurements were derived from cardiovascular magnetic resonance using machine learning. The median (IQR) duration of follow-up was 12.0 (11.3-12.7) years. The associations of LTL with imaging measurements and incident heart failure (HF) were evaluated by multivariable regression models.

The CMR scans available for the current study (n = 40 000) were obtained a mean (SD) 9.0 (1.7) years after the baseline visit. Segmentation of the left and right ventricular and atrial cavities and left ventricular myocardium were performed by automated machine learning algorithms, as detailed previously.13 Global ventricular volume was defined as the sum of the right and left ventricular end-diastolic volumes. LVSV, RVSV, and atrial stroke volumes were calculated by the difference between respective enddiastolic volume and end-systolic volume. LVMVR was derived by dividing LVM with left ventricular end-diastolic volume. End-diastolic biventricular shape models were obtained, as described previously.17 These models were compiled into a statistical shape atlas through principal component analysis, with principal components capturing the largest sources of variation in cardiac shape among the cohort. Through plotting these principal components, we can estimate biological features that they represent. The first principal component represents the overall size of the heart (higher scores having larger hearts), which was the greatest source of variation in heart shape among individuals (eFigure in Supplement 1)."

Given the time lag between LTL sampling and CMR data acquisition, a sensitivity analysis investigating the interaction of the time lag between these 2 dates and LTL was conducted. We sought to identify the association between LTL and incident HF by performing survival analyses using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and smoking status. We also explored the mediating effect of LTL and LVM on incident HF by introducing an interaction term. The effect sizes were represented by a 1-SD increase in loge(LTL) residuals.

As sensitivity analyses, we undertook MR analyses using the weighted median method,21 which is additionally robust in the presence of outliers, and the MR robust adjusted profile score method,22 which overcomes challenges related to measurement error, weak or invalid (due to pleiotropy) measurements, and selection bias (due to weak instrument). We also applied Steiger filtering implemented in the steiger_filtering() function in the R package TwoSampleMR to our genetic instruments, which removed variants that explain more variance in the outcome (ie, imaging measurements or HF) than the exposure (LTL) to minimize the risk of reverse causality. A combination of these approaches provides the best evidence for the presence of a genetic association consistent with a potential causal effect.\nResults Of 40 459 included participants, 19 529 (48.3%) were men, and the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (7.6) years.

Most of the study cohort had CMR measurements within normal ranges23; the proportion of LVH was 2% (806 of 40 332). LVM was lower in higher LTL quartiles in the overall cohort, but when stratified by sex, LVM was higher in the higher LTL quartiles. Our study cohort of UKB participants who had CMR assessment were marginally younger, slightly more likely to be male and White, and had a lower prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors than participants who did not receive CMR examination (eTable 3 in Supplement 1)."

Other imaging traits and HF did not achieve a statistically significant association with LTL, although the overall effect directions were concordant with observational results. There was no evidence of confounding by directional horizontal pleiotropy. Sensitivity analyses with the weighted median and MR robust adjusted profile score methods gave similar estimates as our primary inverse variance\u2013 weighted MR models. Furthermore, Steiger filtering, which removed genetic variants that explain more variance in the outcomes, did not materially alter our findings (eTable 5 in Supplement 1).\nDiscussion To our knowledge, this is the first and largest study to investigate the potential causal association between LTL and a comprehensive set of cardiac structure and function, robustly measured with CMR. Our principal findings are that in a middleaged population (1) longer LTL was associated with higher LVM, larger global ventricular volume and overall size, and higher ventricular and atrial stroke volumes; (2) longer LTL was associated with a lower risk of incident HF even after accounting from traditional cardiovascular risk factors; and (3) the genetic associations between LTL and LVM, LVSV, and global ventricular volume are concordant with the observational results.\nOur findings of an association of longer LTL with increased LVM are consistent with 2 previous reports8,9 that assessed LVM using echocardiography and build on these findings. We advanced this insight by highlighting that longer LTL was also associated with larger global ventricular volume and size and higher LVSV. Our finding of better left ventricular systolic function with longer LTL in a general population parallels the data from 2 small prior studies, which reported the associations between shorter LTL and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in a hypertensive mouse model24 and in a human HF cohort.25 The overall pattern of cardiac morphofunctional differences observed with longer LTL (higher LVM, larger global ventricular volume, static LVMVR, larger atria, and higher ventricular and atrial stroke volumes) closely resembles beneficial balanced myocardial remodeling frequently\nseen with the physiological adaptation to exercise (eg, athlete heart).26 We also provide compelling genetic evidence, based on multiple MR approaches, that the associations of LTL with LVM, global ventricular volume, and LVSV are consistent with a potential causal association.\nThe impact of LTL on cardiac structure and function could have clinical relevance. We demonstrated in this work that longer LTL was associated with a reduced observed incidence of HF in UKB (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81-0.91; P = 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22126). The MR analysis was nonsignificant (odds ratio per 1-SD longer LTL, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.89-1.03), possibly related to low power. However, no firm conclusion can be drawn based on these data, and future studies using information from larger genomewide association study are needed. Other studies have shown that LTL is shorter in patients with HF and is associated with poor prognosis.6,27-29 Experimental studies also directly support a role of telomere dynamics in cardiac structure and function. With aging, telomerase knockout mice hearts showed shortening of telomeres, attenuated proliferation and increased apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, and greater cardiac remodeling and left ventricular failure.30,31 On the other hand, enhanced expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase in rat cardiomyocytes preserved telomere length and induced cardiomyocyte proliferation, hypertrophy, and survival.32 While it is recognized that left ventricular hypertrophy and left ventricular dilatation in isolation are associated with adverse outcomes, through access to a more comprehensive set of imaging features, our study demonstrated a more global positive pattern of cardiac remodeling in association with longer LTL, which could explain the lower incidence of HF."

Nevertheless, several limitations need to be acknowledged. First, there is a healthy volunteer selection bias in the UKB, with the participants being older, more affluent, and having a healthier lifestyle with fewer comorbid conditions than the UK general\njamacardiology.com (Reprinted) JAMA Cardiology September 2023 Volume 8, Number 9 813\nDownloaded from jamanetwork.com by guest on 01/13/2024\npopulation.33 The imaging substudy cohort is even slightly healthier than the overall UKB cohort. In line with this observation, most of our study cohort had imaging measurements within normal physiological ranges, and the applicability of our findings in disease states leading to left ventricular hypertrophy is uncertain. Second, most of our cohort (97%) is White, which may limit the generalizability of our findings in underrepresented races and ethnicities. Third, telomere length was quantified in blood leukocytes, which may not reflect cellspecific or tissue-specific telomere length. Fourth, the LTL and CMR measurements were obtained at different time points. The impact of this on the findings is uncertain but, if anything, is likely to have blunted the magnitude of the observed associations. Furthermore, our findings from MR, which circumvents the issues of confounding, measurement errors, and reverse causation in observational studies, provide concordant results for the key findings. Conclusions In this study, longer LTL was associated with higher LVM, larger global ventricular size, and better cardiac function and a lower risk of incident HF. Further investigations into the prognostic relevance of LTL in adverse cardiac remodeling and the related mechanistic pathways could provide insights into the novel risk stratification approaches and therapeutic targets for HF.\nARTICLE INFORMATION\nAccepted for Publication: May 31, 2023.\nPublished Online: July 26, 2023. doi:10.1001/jamacardio.2023.2167\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2023 Aung N et al.
