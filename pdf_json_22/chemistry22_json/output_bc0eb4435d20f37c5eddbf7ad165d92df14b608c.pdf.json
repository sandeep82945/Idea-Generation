            "text": "Folic acid metabolism plays an important role in the de-novo synthesis of purines and thymedate, which are necessary for DNA replication and repair. Therefore, errors or deficiencies in the distribution of methyl groups due to folate metabolism affect both methylation and DNA synthesis processes that play an important role in cancer development [1]. Defect in folate metabolism also causes cardiovascular diseases, neural tube defects, cleft lip and palate, late pregnancy complications, and neurodegenerative diseases [2]. It has also been reported that folic acid deficiency is associated with congenital malformations of the spine, skull and brain in infant development during pregnancy [3]. Therefore, the sensitive determination of folic acid in the clinical site is very important in diagnosing many diseases. Sensor systems have recently become the most used and intended devices in clinical field diagnosis and diagnosis methods due to their fast response time and low-cost features. These devices offer many advantages such as the ability to analyze small volume samples, faster analysis time, compliance with automation procedures, and increased reliability and repeatability [4].\nElectrochemical determination methods are fast, inexpensive, and easy to apply, which allows accurate measurement of the quantities of various compounds in a wide range of samples [5]. Previously, electrochemical analyses of pharmaceutical compounds were carried out using mercury-based electrodes that replaced graphite and metallic macro electrodes [6]. Today, macro-electrodes are produced from pyrolytic graphene, glassy carbon or boron diamond electrodes that can also be used by modifying or modifying with micro and nanostructures [7]. These developments have revealed new types of biosensors based on surface-printed electrodes (SPE) for the determination of various compounds in a wide range of sample matrixes. SPE\u2019s are disposable devices with plenty of uses in a wide range of fields, including analytical chemistry, drug control, and clinical and environmental analysis due to significant developments in the last\nKey words: Folic acid, nanostructures, MIP, nanobiosensors\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\ndecade [8]. SPE-based biosensors can be considered as tools that provide important advantages such as low design limit, simple operation, low cost, portability and miniaturization potential, analytical detection of pharmaceuticals in a wide range of samples [9].\nMolecular imprinting is an important method based on the use of materials capable of recognizing the target molecule specifically. Molecularly imprinted materials (MIPs) have many advantages such as selectivity, stability, reusability, and cost-effectiveness. However, MIPs prepared with the traditional technique have some disadvantages such as missing template removal, low binding capacity, high diffusion barrier, and low area accessibility. Because most of the imprinted areas are in the interior of the MIP material, in order to solve these problems, a surface imprinting technique has been developed in recent years, which involves the creation of the MIP layer on the surface of nanostructures. This method provides the advantages of higher bonding capacity and faster bonding kinetics on the material surface [10]. Due to the properties of MIPs combined with electrochemical studies, such as ease of use and low cost, their applications in the field of sensors have also increased today [11]. However, before MIP-based sensors take part in the sensor market, some problems still need to be overcome. The most important of these problems is the change in the distance of the imprinted cavities to the sensor surface and consequently the low signaling [12]. To prevent this problem and improve electrochemical signaling, the researchers focused on developing ultra-thin and homogeneous polymeric films on the surface of nano-sized support material with outstanding electrical conductivity such as graphene and an extremely large surface area. This ensures greater selectivity for thin MIP layers [13].\nSince graphene has a wider specific surface area than 3D silica and other nanoparticles, it is quite suitable for supporting MIP to be produced by the surface imprinting technique. Located on the surface of graphene (graphene / MIP composite), MIP not only exhibits faster adsorption and desorption dynamics but also demonstrates a high binding capacity and high selectivity toward the target molecule [14]. In addition, graphene, which has a large \u03c0-electron system, has a strong affinity against carbon-based ring structures found in drugs, pollutants, and biomolecules [15]. In addition to all this, graphene is highly suitable to produce high-precision electrochemical MIP sensors thanks to its impressive properties such as high electron transfer speed, high heat, and electrical conductivity, exceptional elasticity and hardness, and high thermal stability [16]. Graphene has two degrees of oxidation; graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). GO has low conductivity and is water-soluble, while rGO has good conductivity and poor water solubility. The excellent solubility of GO in an aqueous solution is mainly due to oxygen-rich hydrophilic groups such as hydroxyl, epoxide, and carboxylic groups. These functional groups on the surface can interact with functional groups of the molecule that is intended to bind to the surface, providing a large number of reaction zones [17]. In addition, GO increases the detection area per unit volume due to its wide specific surface area (2630 m2g\u22121), which provides high sensitivity for the sensor device [18]. However, as mentioned above, GO\u2019s hosting of oxygen-rich functional groups causes the electrical conductivity to decrease. Therefore, especially in sensor applications, GO is reduced. After the reduction, most oxygen-containing groups in GO, especially hydroxyl, epoxide, and carboxyl groups, are completely removed and converted into graphene rich in \u03c0-conjugation, i.e. reduced graphene oxide [19]. \u03c0-conjugation in graphene layers restores the conductivity of graphene. But it reduces its solubility in water and many other organic solvents. In addition, rGO is not very compatible with some other materials, such as polymer matrices. Various techniques have been developed to solve this problem, including the physical adsorbing of functional molecules to graphene layers and the chemical binding of functional groups to the graphene surface [20]. To date, the distribution of rGO in aqueous solutions has been achieved by physically adsorbing molecules and polymers containing functional groups that dissolve in water into rGO layers. But the presence of such stabilizers is undesirable for most applications [19]. Although there are many studies on surface-imprinting composites obtained using GO, studies on surface-imprinted composites with rGO are very few, especially those that are intended to be produced in the desired nature due to the poor dispersion of graphene layers in various solvents.\nIn this study, in the first step, folic acid was molecularly imprinted in the presence of silanized rGO (MPTSrGO), using a functional comonomer (N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl] acrylamide (NAT)), cross-linker and initiator molecules. This synthesized nanostructure [(FA-Imp-poly(MPTS-rGO-co-NAT)] was characterized by FTIR, SEM-EDS, AFM, and Elemental analysis methods. In the second step, a surface-imprinted carbon electrode (SPCE) was developed using (FA-Imp-poly(MPTS-rGO-co-NAT) nanostructure. The surface imprinted carbon electrode was modified, and measurements were made with ascorbic acid, dopamine selectivity studies, which are structural analogues of folic acid, and electrochemical studies with circular voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Analytical characteristics of the developed nanosensor system (standard deviation, observance limit, determination limit, etc.) were determined. In this way, the analytical performance of the developed nanosensor system was evaluated. Kinetic analyses of the developed nanosensor system were carried out with commercial blood samples."

The template molecule (FA) and functional monomer (NAT) were pretreated for 2 h. MPTS-rGO nanostructures were dispersed in 20 mL of DMF then mixed with the precomplex solution and passed through nitrogen (N2) gas for 3 min.\nMolecular imprinting was performed with free radical polymerization method for 24 h at 60 \u00b0C in the presence of EGDMA as a crosslinker and 0.02 g of KPS as an initiator. Polymerization conditions and the recipe for polymerization conditions are given in Table 1. EGDMA was used as 10 times the ratio of functional monomer moles. Because the crossbinding ratio in molecular imprinting is many times higher than the total amount of monomer moles, it plays a role in the stability of the imprinted regions belonging to the target molecule, and if this mole ratio is low, the imprinting zones are close to each other, and the imprinting efficiency decreases. In addition, the amount of potassium persulphate (KPS) selected as the initiator is taken as a reference from the study conducted by Kuru et al. (2017) and Karako\u00e7 et al. (2009) [23,24]. After the resulting folic acid-imprinted nanostructures were precipitated at 18,000 rpm for 1 h, monomer, substance, and initiator that did not react by washing once with deionized water, once with ethyl alcohol, and again with deionized water were removed. After washing, folic acid, which is the template molecule, was removed from the main structure using a desorption solution consisting of acetic acid:methanol (1:9) mixture [25].\nNonimprinted (NIP) nanostructures were prepared in the polymerization environment with the same method without template molecules (folic acid). Synthesis steps and possible chemical interactions are shown in Figure 2. Figure 3 shows MPTS-rGO interactions."

As can also be understood from the FTIR spectrum, there are plenty of functional molecules (groups of carboxylic, hydroxyl, and carbonyl) on the surface of the synthesized GO.\nWhen the FTIR spectrum of GO-MPTS is examined, the stretching vibrations of the bands -CH2 groups in 2918 and 2850 cm\u22121 in the spectrum, a strong absorption band at 1726 cm\u22121 refers to the stretch vibration of C=O groups. The band at 1582 cm\u22121 corresponds to vinyl groups of MPTS units on GO layers. The bands in spectrum 1068 and 688 cm\u22121 are caused by the stretching vibration of the Si-O-C bonds. Furthermore, the presence of bands in 1068 and 890 cm-1 related to (Si-O\u2013O\u2013C/Si-O\u2013Si) is further proof that silanization has been successfully performed. However, the C=C stretching of the MPTS vinyl group coincides with the length band (1625 cm\u22121) of approximately 1580 cm\u22121 GO. In GO-MPTS, the shift of the C=O stress vibration to 1726 cm\u22121 is also evidence silanization."

As the number of substances connected to the surface increases, it becomes difficult for the iron in the solution to reach the conductive part of the electrode. In light of this principle, the amount of connection on the surface can be calculated from the decreasing signal quantity due to decreased conductivity."

Measurements in differential pulse voltage were performed at an application speed of 5.10\u20132 volts per second in the potential range of \u20130.4 to 0.6 volts. Measurements were made in 3 repetitions. DPV measurements were carried out at different folic acid concentrations (1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 100, 200 ng/mL) in order to optimize folic acid binding time to the electrode surface connected to imprinted nanostructures. The calibration curve and properties of the nanosensor are given in Figure 7 and Table 3, respectively. As we mentioned above, DPV technique was preferred for evaluating the analytical performance of the nanosensor. In response to the biosensor, the difference between the before (SPCE) and subsequent (SPCE/ MIP-MPTS-rGO-co-NAT) and SPCE/MIP-MPTS-rGO co-NAT/FA DPV peak values in different concentrations was used (D\u03bcA). The calibration graph of the nanosensor was prepared in a buffer of 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 100, 200 ng/mL folic acid in a buffer of 10 mM Sodium phosphate (pH:7.4) and obtained by applying it to the nanosensor (Figure 7). Linearity between 1.25\u2013200 ng/mL FA was observed according to the calibration graph obtained. This calibration chart was expressed with the correct equation y = 0.05313 x + 15.82 (R2 = 0.989). The slope standard deviation and % variation coefficient were calculated as 0.00255% and 2.29%, respectively \u00b1 as a result of 8 repeated measurements. After 8 measurements were taken using 10 ng/mL FA, the lowest detection limit (LOD) was calculated as 7.54 ng/mL with 3Sb/m formula, and the determination limit (LOQ) was calculated as 25.14 ng/mL with 10Sb/m formula.

As a result of DPV measurements, it was determined that the imprinted nanosensor system is approximately 7 times more selective to the folic acid molecule compared to its structural analogues.

            "text": "The normal concentration of FA in human serum is approximately 2\u201315 ng/mL [29]. Therefore, it is very important from a clinical perspective to determine the FA sensitively. Numerous methods such as spectrophotometric [30], thermogravimetry [31], and HPLC were applied in FA measurement [32].\nAlthough these techniques are precise and accurate, they are expensive, complex, and time- consuming. In recent years, electrochemical methods have gained a lot of attention and have been widely used to detect and identify various biological compounds, organic molecules, and inorganic ions. Low cost, ease of application, high repeatability, rapid response, and low detection limit are some advantages that indicate the reason for the intense interest in electrochemical methods [33,34]. The literature data were examined, and the potentials of sensor systems developed for folic acid determination were investigated. Some of the studies carried out in this context are summarized below.\nArvand and Dehsaraei (2013) linked folic acid on the surface of the modified carbon electrode (AuNPs/CPE) with gold nanoparticles [35]. Without any complex and time-consuming steps, FA was determined in the human blood plasma sample. In the study, the FA limit of quantification was 6 \u00d7 10\u20138 and 8 \u00d7 10\u20135 mol L\u20131 (LOD) is 2.7 \u00d7 10\u20138. The MIPbased FA sensor is designed using a new monomer (2,4,6-trisacrylamido-1,3,5-triazine, TAT) technique on carbon. It is induced for direct electronic transmission into the carbon polymer. Only FA molecules trapped in the MIP cavity are oxidized on the surface of the MIP-fiber sensor. The cyclic voltammogram showed well-defined redox peaks. The method was found to be more specific and RSD = 1.3% to 0.20 ng/mL LOD was observed. The analysis was done in blood serum and pharmaceutical samples. The interference was found to be negligible during FA detection in biological samples [36]. In another study, Prasad et al., (2010), an electrochemical sensor was developed using a preprepared sol-gel coated pen graphite (2D class) electrode with molecularly imprinted polymer for selective and quantitative recognition of folic acid [37]. As a result of electrochemical studies performed with molecularly imprinted polymer synthesized using functional monomer to triaminotriazine, the linear range 0.007\u20130.156 \u03bcg/mL determination limit was determined as 0.002 \u03bcg/mL. Benvidi et al. (2015) produced glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified with reduced graphene oxide (rGO), gold nanoparticles, and 2-(3,4-dihydroxy phenyl) benzothiazole (DHB), gold nanoparticles by electrochemical deposition method on rGO/GCE. This sensor was simultaneously applied to the determination of\nlevodopa (LD), uric acid (UA), and folic acid (FA). The developed electrode determined the determination of LD, UA, and FA in some standard samples (e.g., Madopar tablet, urine, and human blood serum) by the standard adding method [38]. Chekin et al. (2016) prepared and characterized a matrix based on molybdenum disulfide reduced graphene oxide hybrid (MoS2-rGO). The modification of the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with MoS2-rGO (MG) was carried out by drip and drying method on the electrode surface. In experiments conducted in the presence of various types of interventions, the 10 nM determination limit was determined, and the linear range was 0.01 \u03bcM\u2013100 \u03bcM [39]. In their study He et al. (2016), they modified the sensor surface by electrophoretic accumulation (EPD) on golden electrodes, rGO adsorption, and the functionalization of rGO with folic acid. Using this method, a determination limit of 1 pM is obtained [40]. The method also ensured the detection of folic acid in serum. Rajabi et al. (2017) synthesized with a new two-phase (organic-water) synthesis method of poly (ortho-metoxyanilin) nanostructures (POMANS) for the determination of folic acid (FA) and uric acid (UA), and this polymer was used to create a modified multi-walled carbon nanotube graphite paste electrode (POMANS-MWCNT/GPE). The assignment limit for UA and FA is 0.157 and 0.113 \u03bcM respectively [41]. Kuceki et al. (2018) aim to develop a graphite/limited access molecularly suppressed poly (metacritical acid)/SiO2 composite-based voltammetric sensor for folic acid determination in pharmaceutical formulations. Experiments with graphite cake electrodes prepared with limited access hybrid molecular imprinted polymer (RAM-MIP) resulted in an increase in cathodic peak current for FA. Since the electrical conductivity of RAMMIP is very poor, it has been found that the optimum content is very low (%3, w/w) in the composite. Under conditions optimized using square wave voltammetry, linear ranges between 0.72 \u03bcg L\u2212 1 (1.63 nmol L\u22121) and 5.0 to 100.0 \u03bcg L\u2212 1 (0.01 to 0.23 \u03bcmol L\u2212 1) were obtained [42].\nThe FA is a possible tumour marker for cancer screening. It has been accepted that the concentration of FA in the blood of cancer patients is lower than that of healthy individuals [43]. However, for the determination of this biological token at a low concentration (range of picomolar), it requires the use of ultra-precise detection methods. In addition, folic acid determination is important in diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, neural tube defects, cleft lip and palate, late pregnancy complications, neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Therefore, from a clinical point of view, it is very important that the FA is appointed sensitively. However, only two of the sensor systems developed for FA determination in the above literature summaries offer sufficient precision for the real-time determination of the FA. Numerous methods have also been developed for FA determination, such as spectrophotometry [30], thermogratrometry [31], and high-performance liquid chromatography [44]. Although these techniques are precise and highly repeatable, they are expensive, complex, and time-consuming. In the clinic, the chemiluminescence immunoassay method (CLIA) is currently used for folic acid determination. In the CL method, marking is done with a substance that gives chemiluminescence. In this method, analysis is mandatory on a single device and, accordingly, a single kit. They are also expensive compared to open systems. Since the CL reagent is not specific to single analytics, its selectivity is low. Accordingly, detector responses resulting from measurement may be misleading [45]. CL emission densities are affected by a variety of environmental factors, such as temperature, solvent, ionic force, pH, and other types in the system. Also, since the emission intensity from the CL reaction varies depending on the time (a light increase consisting of a signal increase after the reagent is mixed passes through the maximum and falls to the baseline), the time profile against CL emissions varies from one compound to another. Therefore, care should be taken to detect the difference in current occurring at times defined as references. In many CL systems, there is a low level of background emissions in the absence of an analyte. Therefore, in streaming systems, CL signals increase in proportion to analyte concentration when the mixture of analyte and reagent(s) passes through the detector cell and appear as overlapping sharp peaks when displayed by the time window. Due to the fact that CL emissions are measured only from this small-time profile, nonlinear graph can be obtained when reactions with complex kinetics are graphed against analyte concentration [46].\nIn this study, it is aimed to develop an alternative sensor system to the chemiluminescence immunoassay method used for folic acid determination. The folic acid-imprinted nanomaterials recommended in the study were synthesized for the first time for this purpose. Some characteristics of the developed nanosensor; detection limit (LOD) was 7.54 ng/mL and determination limit (LOQ) were 25.14 ng/mL. FA analytical (10 and 20 ng/mL) was added to commercial synthetic serum samples by standard adding method and RSD values of 0.092% and 0.734% were found in DPV technique and measurements respectively.\nThe design, synthesis, and modification methods of the imprinted nanostructure used in the study are unique. This nanostructure is also unique in terms of its use in the nanosensor developed for the determination of folic acid. It has been determined that the nanosensor developed for the determination of folic acid within the scope of the study has high selectivity, requires a small sample volume, does not require pretreatment, has a low detection limit and cost, and can respond quickly."
