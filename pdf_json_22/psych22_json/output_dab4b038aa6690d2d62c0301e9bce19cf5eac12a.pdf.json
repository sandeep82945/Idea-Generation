Using a bibliometric\ntool, this study aims to evaluate the origin, current hotspots, and research\ntrends on PMD.\nMethods: Articles with research on PMD were retrieved from Web of Science\nCore Collection (WoSCC). We used the bibliometric method to analyze\npublication years, journals, countries, institutions, authors, research hotspots,\nand trends. We plotted the reference co-citation network and used keywords\nto analyze the research hotspots and trends.\nResults: A total of 209 publications related to PMD were identified from\nWoSCC on May 8, 2022. The number of publications concerning PMD\nevery year shows an upward trend. Further analysis indicated that 209\narticles were contributed by 45 countries, 288 institutions, and 501 authors.\nThe United States contributed the most significant number of publications,\nfollowed by China.

Major depression, postmenopausal women, symptoms like\nhot flashes, and prevalence and risk factors are research hotspots in the PMD\nfield. The frontiers in PMD field that will impact future research are anxiety,\nmeta-analysis, association, and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II).\nConclusion: These findings provide us with the core countries, institutions,\nand authors in PMD research and point out the direction of attention in this\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 01 frontiersin.org\nfield. The current research focuses on depression, postmenopausal women,\nhot flashes, and other symptoms, as well as the prevalence and risk factors.\nThe frontiers will be anxiety, meta-analysis, related factors, and depression\nassessment in future research.\nKEYWORDS\nperimenopausal depression, web of science, trends, knowledge domain, CiteSpace front psychiatry"

            "text": "Perimenopause is a natural physiological event in women that involves premenopause, menopausal transition, and early post-menopause (1). Within the female life cycle, women demonstrate a higher prevalence of or are at risk of depressive symptoms (2\u20134). Published research indicates that the highest rate of depression in perimenopause was 25.99% in Shanghai, China (5), and the prevalence of depression in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women in India is 42.47% (6). Furthermore, perimenopausal depression (PMD) is one of the forms of reproductive depression in women related to hormonal changes (7, 8). Women with PMD reported significantly decreased quality of life (QOL), social support, adjustment, suicidal thoughts, and increased disability and compared with non-depressed perimenopausal women (9).\nThere has been growing research on depression among perimenopausal women in recent years. However, there is no bibliometric analysis via CiteSpace on global research trends and hotspots in this field. CreateSpace is scientific software that has been widely used to identify frontier areas of current research by extracting burst terms from identifiers of titles, abstracts, descriptors, and bibliographic records (10). CiteSpace\u2019s recognition in the field of research has increased considerably in recent years. It is used widely in many research fields such as medicine, geology, and others (11\u201313) and has promoted the rapid development of relevant research (14).\nThis study aims to investigate the knowledge domain and gain insights into emerging trends and hot spots of PMD by constructing a visualization network via CiteSpace."

The size of each node indicated the count. Each node was represented by a series of citation rings representing different years, and the thickness of the ring was proportional to the citation count in the corresponding time zone.
