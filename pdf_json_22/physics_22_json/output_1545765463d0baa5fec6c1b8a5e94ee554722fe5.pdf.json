Ho we ver, at high redshifts ( z > 3) there are many utstanding questions on the shape and evolution of the UV LF. The uminosity regime \u221224 < M UV < \u221222.5 is especially challenging, as his is where the galaxy and AGN comoving space densities become omparable (Ono et al. 2018 ; Ste v ans et al. 2018 ; Adams et al. 2020 ; owler et al. 2021 ; Harikane et al. 2021 ). Here, the space density is ow enough that Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) programmes do not rovide enough cosmic volume to produce statistically significant amples of objects (e.g. Oesch et al. 2010 ; McLure et al. 2013 ; ouwens et al. 2015 , 2021 ; Finkelstein et al. 2015 ; Parsa et al. 2016 ;\nshigaki et al. 2018 ). Meanwhile, ground-based observations co v er arger surv e y v olumes, b ut lower resolution makes morphological ifferentiation between galaxies and AGN (e.g. Masters et al. 2012 ; kiyama et al. 2018 ; Matsuoka et al. 2019 ; Niida et al. 2020 ) ore challenging.

Ultimately, this akes it difficult to accurately separate the two populations. These issues of selection and completeness result in contrasting onclusions regarding the faint end of the AGN LF. For example, erived faint-end slopes are in the range \u22122.1 < \u03b1AGN < \u22121.3 at z\n4 (Akiyama et al. 2018 ; Ste v ans et al. 2018 ; Adams et al. 2020 ). n addition, there is an ongoing debate o v er whether the bright end f the galaxy population is better described with a double power aw (DPL) or Schechter function (Schechter 1976 ) beyond some haracteristic luminosity (Bowler et al. 2015 , 2020 ; Ono et al. 2018 ; te v ans et al. 2018 ; Adams et al. 2020 ; Harikane et al. 2021 ) and o what degree lensing effects influence bright-end measurements e.g. Mason et al. 2015 ; Ono et al. 2018 ; Bowler et al. 2020 ). The rimary difference between the DPL and Schechter functions is the radient of the slope brightwards of the characteristic luminosity L \u2217) or \u2018knee\u2019, leading to differing measurements for the comoving pace density of the most luminous systems. An excess in the number ensity of ultra-luminous galaxies M UV < \u221223 has implications for he efficiency of quenching mechanisms at high redshifts, as well as he impact of dust attenuation (e.g. Bouwens et al. 2008 ; Somerville t al. 2012 ; Cai et al. 2014 ; Ono et al. 2018 ). Ho we ver, constraining he numbers of these galaxies with observations pro v es difficult, s the steepness of the bright-end slope is such that galaxies are uickly outnumbered by AGN-dominated sources at z \u2264 6.

This ensures that all sources are accounted for, and hat AGN that have significant contributions from their host galaxy re not discounted through various selection criteria, allowing us to onsider all sources of UV emission (Bowler et al. 2021 ).\nConstraining the comoving space density of highly luminous alaxies and UV-faint AGN is key to understanding several other ssues in extragalactic astronomy at high redshifts. The first of these s the contribution of AGN towards the budget of ionizing photons n the latter stages of reionization, where there has been significant ebate regarding whether AGN are able to sustain the reionization rocess (e.g. Madau & Haardt 2015 ; Yoshiura et al. 2017 ; Boschamon 2018 ; Hassan et al. 2018 ; Parsa, Dunlop & McLure 2018 ; ayal et al. 2020 ). Recent measurements have shown that there is sudden rise in AGN number density post-reionization 3 < z < 6 McGreer et al. 2013 , 2018 ; Jiang et al. 2016 ; Kulkarni, Worseck & ennawi 2019 ; Kim et al. 2020 ; Niida et al. 2020 ; Zhang et al. 2021 ), hich could have implications for the true numbers of AGN present n the Era of Reionization itself ( z > 6). In parallel, there is a large ncertainty in the growth rates of black holes and AGN activity timecales in the early Universe, leading to multiple theoretical formation echanisms of the first supermassive black holes (e.g. Ba \u0303 nados et al. 018 ; Wang et al. 2019 , 2021 ; Yang et al. 2020 ). Finally, the advent f both deep and wide data sets from the likes of the Subaru and ISTA telescopes has generated debate regarding growth rates of he most luminous and massive galaxies during early times and the mpact of dust on their ultraviolet emission (e.g. Ouchi et al. 2009 ; owler et al. 2017 , 2020 ; Stefanon et al. 2019 ; Forrest et al. 2020 ; eeleman et al. 2020 ). Many recent measurements of the UV LF probing the redshift ange of 3 < z < 5 have used colour\u2013colour cuts in order to select alaxy samples (e.g. van der Burg, Hildebrandt & Erben 2010 ; ouwens et al. 2015 ; Ono et al. 2018 ; Harikane et al. 2021 ). While olour\u2013colour cuts can be ef fecti ve in selecting high-redshift samples sing the Lyman break at \u03bbrest < 1216 \u00c5 (Guhathakurta, Tyson & Maewski 1990 ; Steidel & Hamilton 1992 ; Steidel et al. 1996 ), there are ignificant compromises that must be made regarding completeness nd contamination rates. This is because regions of colour\u2013colour pace are shared with lower redshift galaxies and Milky Way brown w arf stars (Stanw ay, Bremer & Lehnert 2008 ; Bowler et al. 2014 ; ilkins, Stanway & Bremer 2014 ). A balance is thus required to btain high sample completeness while minimizing contamination. tudies have shown that with careful selection, sample completeness ith colour\u2013colour cuts can average 60\u201370 per cent and peak up to 0 per cent (e.g. Ouchi et al. 2004 ; Burg et al. 2010 ; Ono et al. 2018 ; arikane et al. 2021 , 2022 ). Extensi ve near-infrared observ ations hat complement optical observations provide the opportunity to mpro v e upon selection criteria by leveraging the full spectral energy istribution (SED) of each source rather than focusing on a select few ptical colours. Studies utilizing SED modelling and photometric edshifts have shown that completeness can be as high as \u223c80\u2013 0 per cent in these redshift ranges, while minimizing the potential or contamination (e.g. McLure et al. 2009 ; Bowler et al. 2015 ; te v ans et al. 2018 ; Adams et al. 2020 ). In this study, we measure the UV LF consistently across three edshift bins: 2.75 < z < 3.5, 3.5 < z < 4.5, and 4.5 < z < .2 using \u223c10 deg 2 of sky containing deep photometry in both he optical and near-infrared. This is performed with the aim of onstraining the comoving space density of UV-faint AGN and V-luminous galaxies, in order to better understand the rise in GN after reionization and determine if the bright end of the\nNRAS 523, 327\u2013346 (2023)\nalaxy population can be better described with a Schechter function r DPL functional form. We conduct this measurement with the se of deep optical and near-infrared photometry available from yperSuprimeCam and the VISTA telescope in the le gac y science elds of COSMOS, XMM-LSS, and Extended Chandra Deep Field outh (E-CDFS). The surv e ys co v ering these fields provide an ideal epth-area combination, enabling rare sources as bright as M UV = 26 to be detected while being simultaneously deep enough to obtain omplete samples of sources as faint as M UV \u223c \u221220.5 at z \u223c 5. We ombine these measurements with results of studies that use other ata sets, whose depth-area combinations are more optimized for xploring brighter and fainter luminosities, to expand the luminosity ange to \u221228.5 < M UV < \u221216 and enable for the simultaneous odelling of the entire observable LF at these redshifts. In Section 2 , we describe the optical and NIR photometric ata used in this study and how these data are used to estimate hotometric redshifts for sample selection. In Section 3 , we assess he completeness of the sample, and then measure and fit the UV F. In Section 4 , we detail the results of our fitting procedure and omment on the performance of the different models. In Section 5 , e expand discussion to contextualize our results with the evolution f galaxies and AGN. We present our conclusions in Section 6 . hroughout this work, we assume a standard cosmology with H 0 = 0 km s \u22121 Mpc \u22121 , M = 0.3, and = 0.7 to allow for ease of omparison with other LF studies. All magnitudes listed follow the B magnitude system (Oke 1974 ; Oke & Gunn 1983 ).\nDATA A N D SAMPLE SELECTI ON\n.1 Photometry\nn this study, we use a multiwavelength data set spanning up to 14 hotometric bands co v ering 0.3\u20132.4 \u03bcm across three e xtragalactic elds (XMM-LSS, COSMOS, E-CDFS). Compared to the work in dams et al. ( 2020 ), the new addition of E-CDFS increases the total rea used by \u224860 per cent. Measurements in the photometric bands re derived from the Canada\u2013France\u2013Hawaii-Telescope Legacy Sure y (CFHTLS; Cuillandre et al. 2012 ), VST Optical Imaging of he CDFS and ELAIS-S1 Fields (VOICE; Vaccari et al. 2016 ), and he HyperSuprimeCam Strategic Survey Programme (HSC DR2; ihara et al. 2018a , b , 2019 ; Ni et al. 2019 ) in the optical regime. ear-infrared data are provided by the final data release of the VISTA eep Extragalactic Observations (VIDEO) surv e y (Jarvis et al. 2013 ) or XMM-LSS and CDFS, while UltraVISTA DR4 (McCracken t al. 2012 ) provides the near-infrared coverage in COSMOS. A reakdown of the available filters and the depths within each subfield s provided in Table 1 . Additionally, a visual representation of the o v erage pro vided by each surv e y in each field is pro vided in Figs 1 , , and 3 for XMM-LSS, COSMOS, and E-CDFS, respectively. With the optical data utilized in this study, the three primary xtragalactic fields can be broken down into a total of five subegions containing approximately uniform depth in the imaging. We esignate these regions COSMOS (COS), XMM-Deep (XMMD), MM-UltraDeep (XMMU), CFHT-D1 (D1), and Chandra Deep ield South (E-CDFS). The XMMU sub-region is centred on the ltra Deep Surv e y from the UK Infrared Telescope (UKIDSS; awrence et al. 2007 ). Coverage in the u \u2217-band in XMM-LSS is btained from the CFHTLS Deep Field programme where available, nd from the Wide Field programme otherwise. We also include the ther optical bands from CFHT within the CFHT D1 and D2 fields see Figs 1 and 2 ), each co v ering 1 de g 2 within XMM-Deep and OSMOS.

Flux is easured in 2 arcsec diameter circular apertures in all bands. These uxes are then corrected with a point-source aperture correction, here we model the point spread function (PSF) with PSFEX (Bertin 011 ); see Bowler et al. ( 2020 ) for further details on catalogue eneration. The images used are seeing-limited and have a full width t half-maximum of around 0.8\u20130.9 arcsec. The sizes of the galaxies e study in this work are sufficiently small ( \u223c1\u20132 kpc; Huang et al. 013 ; Allen et al. 2017 ; Bowler et al. 2017 ) to be dominated by the SF size, and hence we are able to measure accurate colours without he need for PSF matched photometry. The sky area used for each subfield and subsequently the cosmic olumes probed are calculated based on the areas in which the optical nd near-infrared observations o v erlap and large artefacts (e.g. stellar hosting) have been masked out. We present a visual diagram of the ayout of the data for each of the three primary fields in Fig. 1 for he XMM-LSS field, Fig. 2 for the COSMOS field, and Fig. 3 for -CDFS. Between the different filters used for source selection in ur catalogues, there is only one primary difference in the total areas o v ered. This difference originates in the E-CDFS field, where the -selected catalogue uses the VOICE + VIDEO footprint, while the - and z-selected catalogues are confined to the region where both OICE and HSC are present. This is because the HSC data are deeper\nhan VOICE in these two selection bands, but the HSC observations ack r -band co v erage required to confirm the presence of the Lyman reak, requiring VOICE also be included. This results in a loss in small fraction of total area used in the field (3.89 deg 2 compared o 4.08 in the r band). To summarize the area usage in the other elds, the COSMOS region has a surv e y area of 1.51 de g 2 , while the MMD region is 1.56 deg 2 , XMMU is 1.83 deg 2 , and CFHT-D1 s 0.89 deg 2 . Combined, these fields provide a total area of 9.68 eg 2 for the i -band- and z-band-selected catalogues, while the total rea is 9.87 deg 2 for the r -band-selected catalogue.\nNRAS 523, 327\u2013346 (2023)\n.2 Photometric redshifts\nith such a wealth of multiwavelength data in these extragalactic elds, we select our sample following an SED template fitting proceure. Object classification and redshift estimates are made using the emplate fitting photometric redshift code LEPHARE (Arnouts et al. 999 ; Ilbert et al. 2006 ). This code minimizes the \u03c72 of various ED templates for galaxies, AGN, and Milky Way stars using the ultiband photometry and uncertainties. We set the uncertainties f the photometry to a minimum of 5 per cent during the fitting rocess. This minimum error accounts for potential imperfections n the template sets and the filter transparency functions. It also llows for impro v ed conv ergence in the model fitting procedure, ince we are using a finite set of templates, while real galaxies probe continuous distribution of colours. The template sets used in this tudy are the COSMOS SED template set for galaxies (Ilbert et al. 009 ), AGN/quasi-stellar object (QSO)-like objects from Salvato t al. ( 2009 ), and stellar templates from a combination of results from amuy et al. ( 1992 , 1994 ); Bohlin, Colina & Finley ( 1995 ); Pickles 1998 ); and Chabrier et al. ( 2000 ). Additional stellar templates are lso added from the SpeX 1 brown dwarf library. These brown dwarf emplates were added to the sample because M and L-class dwarfs an hav e v ery similar colours to those of z \u223c 5 galaxies (see ection 2.3 for further discussion on brown dwarfs). The treatment erived in Madau ( 1995 ) is used for absorption by the intergalactic edium (IGM) and the Calzetti et al. ( 2000 ) dust law is used with arying strengths of E ( B \u2212 V ) = 0\u20131.5. The SED fitting process was conducted in two stages. In the\nrst stage, we cross-match our catalogues to a spectroscopic sample hich compiles results from the VVDS (LeF \u0300evre et al. 2013 ), VANELS (McLure et al. 2018 ; Pentericci et al. 2018 ; Garilli et al. 2021 ), -COSMOS (Lilly et al. 2009 ), DEIMOS-10K (Hasinger et al. 2018 ), IPERS (Scodeggio et al. 2018 ), and FMOS (Silverman et al. 2015 ) urv e ys. We only use objects with spectroscopic redshifts that have ags indicating a greater than 95 per cent confidence. In addition, he source must have a 5 \u03c3 detection in at least one of the detection ands used. This process provides a total spectroscopic sample of 4 811 cross-matched sources in XMM-LSS and 18 811 sources n COSMOS. Within CDFS, a spectroscopic catalogue of 23 947 ross-matched sources was obtained from the Spitzer Data Fusion ata base (Vaccari 2015 ), featuring results from surv e ys including VDS (LeF \u0300evre et al. 2013 ), BLAST (Eales et al. 2009 ), ACES Cooper et al. 2012 ), GOODS-CANDELS (Hsu et al. 2014 ), OzDES Yuan et al. 2015 ; Childress et al. 2017 ), and VUDS (Tasca et al. 017 ). We also include new spectroscopic redshifts obtained from he LADUMA collaboration using the Anglo-Australian Telescope Wu et al. in preparation). Cross-matched catalogues are then run hrough LEPHARE in its AUTO ADAPT mode, which makes iterative djustments to the zero-points of the photometric filters in order to ptimize the results against the spectroscopic sample. This process is arried out separately for each of the three primary fields, leading to hree sets of zero-point corrections. A diverse spectroscopic sample s required in order to prevent these zero-point modifications from eing biased towards a limited set of galaxy colours. The results f this process provides small offsets (mostly 0\u20130.07 mag with he exception of the u \u2217 band at \u223c0.1\u20130.15 mag) across all bands. hese offsets are then applied to the full photometric catalogue and EPHARE is run a second time to obtain object classification and edshifts for the full sample.\nFigure 4. Comparisons between the photometric redshifts derived in this study and a large compilation of spectroscopic redshifts. In panel (a) we show the results for the XMM-LSS field, in (b) we show COSMOS, and in (c) we show E-CDFS. The blue line shows the one-to-one correlation in the ideal case, and the red lines define the 15 per cent margin in 1 + z that defines a significant outlier.

This can e broken down into two numerical values. First, the outlier rate: he fraction of photometric redshifts which disagrees with the pectroscopic redshift by more than 15 per cent in (1 + z), and second, he Normalized Median Absolute Deviation Hoaglin, Mosteller & ukeyHoaglin et al. (NMAD; 1983 ): a measurement of the spread f the photometric redshifts around the ground truth in a manner hat is resistant to the few extreme outliers that are present, this is efined as 1 . 48 \u00d7 median [ | z | /(1 + z )], where z = z phot \u2212 z spec . cross the COSMOS field we find an outlier rate of 3.1 per cent\nnd a NMAD of 0.029, in XMM-LSS the outlier rate is 4.5 per cent nd the NMAD is 0.031, and finally CDFS has an outlier rate of .5 per cent and NMAD of 0.037. Fig. 4 shows the spectroscopic edshifts against our photometric redshift estimates. We note a small ias in the photometric redshifts in the range of 0.8 < z < 1.4, where hotometric redshifts are systematically lower than spectroscopic edshifts with a mean z = \u22120.06, three times larger than the rest of he redshift space. This leads to a slight skew in the z histograms f Fig. 4 . Ho we ver, such a bias is not present when considering the edshift range of interest in this study.\nFocusing on the redshift ranges of interest, we find that we uccessfully reco v er (within 15 per cent of 1 + z) 592/911 of the ross-matched spectroscopic objects in the range 2.5 < z < 3.5\n65 per cent), 218/257 in the range 3.5 < z < 4.5 (85 per cent), nd 125/142 objects in the range 4.5 < z < 5.5 (88 per cent). The ajority of cases of incorrectly identified sources at z 4 and 5 are result of blending issues that result in a dilution of the Lyman break nd an underestimated redshift ( z < 1). Such objects are accounted or as part of our completeness simulations which are detailed in he LF determination (Section 3.1 ). The performance at z 3 is orse than that of the other two bins due to the limited wavelength o v erage of the study. At these redshifts, the Lyman break at 1216 lies redwards of the u band, but the level of attenuation bluewards f the break is not as strong as at higher redshifts in the rest frame 12\u20131216 \u00c5 (Madau 1995 ; Inoue et al. 2014 ), leading to a shallower rop in the u \u2217-flux. In addition, the u \u2217 band is often shallower than he r band used for the selection of targets at z = 3, and a shallow\n\u2217-band Lyman break has degeneracies with the Balmer break at z 0.4. These effects makes it difficult to ascertain if a target is truly t 2.5 < z < 3.5, especially towards the lower redshift boundary, here the influence of the break is at its weakest in the u \u2217 band. It s therefore not a surprise that we find that the spectroscopic redshift eco v ery rate is found to be around 60 per cent in the redshift region f 2.5 < z spec < 2.75 and increases to 80 per cent at 2.75 < z spec < .5, indicating that the issue does indeed lie with sources with the ildest of Lyman breaks in the u -band. We therefore limit our z \u223c 3 V LF to the redshift range 2.75 < z < 3.5.\nMNRAS 523, 327\u2013346 (2023)\nM\nFigure 5.

First, the source has a \u22655 \u03c3 detection in the band ontaining the rest-frame ultraviolet continuum emission ( r for z 3 nd i for z 4). Secondly the source has a best-fitting SED template minimal \u03c72 ) that is a galaxy or a QSO with a redshift in the range f 2.75 < z < 3.5 or 3.5 < z < 4.5 for the r - and i -selected samples. maximum \u03c72 cut of 100 is employed in order to remo v e sources hat are possible artefacts or contaminated sources while retaining ources whose statistics might be limited by the use of a discrete emplate set. .3.2 Selecting the initial sample of 4.5 < z < 5.2 sources o produce a sample of z 5 galaxies and AGN, we first select 2 489 objects which have a best-fitting SED (minimum \u03c72 ) as being galaxy or QSO within the redshift range of 4.5 < z < 5.5 and have 5 \u03c3 detection in the HSC-z band. The strong Lyman break exhibited y galaxies at these redshifts should result in a non-detection in the FHT- u \u2217 band. As a result, we also implement a requirement for a 3 \u03c3 u \u2217 detection in order to minimize the potential for lower redshift\nontaminants. Ho we ver, it was immediately obvious that these cuts lone were insufficient to produce a robust sample of z 5 galaxies. xamining the redshift distribution of the sample revealed a large pike in number counts for luminous objects ( M UV < \u221222) with z 5.2. Such a spike in number counts can be attributed to Milky ay brown dwarfs, particularly M-class dwarfs whose optical/NIR olours become degenerate with high-redshift galaxies at z > 5.2 (see ig. 5 for an example of the colours of z \u223c 5 galaxies and brown dwarf tars around the redshifted Lyman Break). The inclusion of the brown warf templates from the SpeX data set was found to reduce the umber of ultra-luminous sources at z > 5.2 by greater than a factor f 2, but a significant spike in apparently luminous objects remained.\nNRAS 523, 327\u2013346 (2023)\nA possible solution to this problem is the inclusion of Spitzer RAC data, which can break the de generac y between z \u223c 5 galaxies nd M-class brown dwarf stars. This is because the brown dwarfs roadly follow Planck\u2019s law and decrease in luminosity towards he mid-infrared, while high-redshift galaxies remain flat (See owler et al. 2014 , for more details). However, deep Spitzer data ave a larger PSF and the subsequent source blending issues can ntroduce an additional layer of complexity into the sample selection rocedure. A second solution would be to introduce an upper limit f z < 5.2 to the UV LF. Such a cut only causes a small shift in he mean redshift of the UV LF from z = 4 . 9 to z = 4 . 8 and greatly\ninimizes the o v erlap in colour space between galaxies and brown warfs. We thus proceed with restricting the sample to 4.5 < z < .2 and again apply a quality cut of \u03c7best < 100, which remo v es the orst fit 1 per cent of objects from the sample. This process provides total of 15 025 galaxy and AGN candidates in the range 4.5 < z < .2 with which we can measure the UV LF.\n.4 Assessing contamination\ne ne xt e xamine the contamination rate of low-redshift sources ntering the redshift range of interest, which is found to be very ow. Across the full sample of \u223c58 000 spectroscopically confirmed ources in our three primary fields, we find a total of 12, 4, and 1 ow-redshift interlopers enter our final sample of galaxies in each f our 2.75 < z < 3.5, 3.5 < z < 4.5, and 4.5 < z < 5.2 bins. The pectroscopic sample makes up approximately 2.5 to 4 per cent of the otal number of sources detected to 5 \u03c3 in each of the three main fields sed. Ho we ver, there is a bias towards spectroscopic sources being ore numerous at brighter luminosities. The majority of the sources sed to measure the UV LF\u2019s in this study occupy the apparent agnitude range of 23.5 < m < 26.5. Within this luminosity range, nly 1361 sources, or 0.08 per cent of the 1.65 million sources at this uminosity range, have spectroscopic redshifts across our three fields. nder the simple assumption that the contamination rate measured n the spectroscopic sample in this luminosity range continues for he full photometric sample, the total number of contaminants will e approximately 1000 times that found in the spectroscopic sample. his amounts to 6, 9, and 8 per cent contamination rate of the final edshift bins. As the o v erall contamination is found to be less than 0 per cent and of similar scale to other systematic errors (e.g. cosmic ariance), we do not consider any major contamination corrections o the UV LF.\nM E T H O D S\nrmed with our robust samples, we proceed to measure the UV LF, aking into account the completeness of our sample and the effects f cosmic variance.\n.1 Completeness simulation\nhe incompleteness of source detection can be described primarily hrough two effects. The first of these is the probability that an object s lost due to partial or total blending with a secondary source in the mage. The second is the dependence on M UV , redshift, and location ithin the imaging data on whether a source meets the magnitude cut orresponding to the average 5 \u03c3 depth used for selecting a confident ample.\nThe impact of the first effect can be assessed by examining the egmentation map generated by SEXTRACTOR for each image. The atio between the number of unoccupied sky pixels and the total\nFigure 6. The completeness distribution as derived from the injection + reco v ery simulation performed in each of the five sub-fields. The y -axis displays the rest-frame ultraviolet magnitude of the simulated source, while the x -axis displays the input redshift. The lighter (upper, left) regions show high source completeness (around 90 per cent at maximum), while the darker (lower, right) shows comparatively low completeness (less than 50 per cent). The sudden changes seen at 50 per cent completeness limit denote where the photometric band used for selection changes (at redshifts 3.5 and 4.5). The CFHT-D1 simulation does not extend above redshift 4.5 as for z 5 it uses the same imaging as the HSC data from XMM-DEEP.\nn a s i b b n w i t T 4 s i u f ( l t i w p b d i\nt d ( t a o p i s a c c c T\ne t c p t\np u c B 2 F ( c d t\n3\nW t o e s d i ( < a i c\nw c w\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/523/1/327/7153338 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\number of unmasked pixels can provide the percentage chance that randomly positioned source would o v erlap with another. In this ituation, we apply a simple assumption that a highly blended source s one where the centre of the source lies on a pixel already occupied y another, leading to cases where the source is upwards of 50 per cent lended. Such a source is regarded as irretrie v able and is assumed to ot fall within our source selection. To correct for the second effect, e conduct a simulation where 10.4 million f ak e sources are injected nto the images used for sample selection. Sources are inserted such hat there are 200 000 for every 0.25 bin in redshift in each sub-field. o a v oid making the images artificially o v erdense, we insert only 000 objects at a time into the images before reprocessing. These ources have an assumed spatial profile that is described by a S \u0300ersic ndex of n = 1 (S \u0301ersic 1963 ; Conselice 2014 ) and have an intrinsic ltraviolet luminosity that is drawn in the range \u221223 < M UV < \u221218 rom the redshift evolution of the UV LF derived in Bouwens et al. 2015 ). This ensures that we account for Eddington bias, where the arger number of faint sources have a chance of being scattered abo v e he 5 \u03c3 detection limit. Simulated sources have a half-light radius that s sampled from the results by Huang et al. ( 2013 ) for z = 4 and 5, ith the trends found extrapolated to z 3. The resultant luminosity rofile is then convolved with the PSF model for the respective and and field combination. Our observations however are seeingominated ( \u22480.8\u20130.9 arcsec) and so the assumptions regarding the ntrinsic light profile make negligible difference to our results.\nWe restrict the simulation from placing galaxies with a cenral coordinate that is occupied by another source. This prevents ouble counting the first effect and allows instances for partial < 50 per cent ) blending to occur. To add in the probability of otal blending to the final completeness estimation, the reco v ery rate s a function of redshift and UV luminosity is scaled by the ratio f previously unoccupied pixels and the total number of unmasked ix els. The deriv ed completeness curv es for each re gion are presented n Fig. 6 . To minimize the complexity of our selection functions, ubfields are only used in the measurement in the final LF if they re considered complete ( > 50 per cent) across the full bin width onsidered (e.g. 2.75 < z < 3.5 for z \u223c 3). In addition, to minimize osmic variance we require that at least two sub-fields be 50 per cent omplete when calculating our final measurement of the UV LF. he implementation of the 50 per cent completeness requirement\nf fecti vely increases the SNR cuts to the final sample. We find he absolute magnitudes brightwards of this completeness limit orrespond to around 7.5 \u03c3 detections in each of our sub-fields. The eak completeness of 80\u201385 per cent in each of our fields matches he reco v ery rate of the spectroscopic sample.\nThe authors note that this simulation considers only the incomleteness of successfully identifying a source within the imaging sed for detection. There are studies that go on to simulate galaxy olours and reproduce the full sample selection procedure (see e.g. ouwens et al. 2015 ; Bowler et al. 2015 , 2020 ; Finkelstein et al. 015 ; Ono et al. 2018 ; Ste v ans et al. 2018 ; Harikane et al. 2021 ). rom experience gathered from the simulations run in Bowler et al. 2015 , 2020 ) on the same data used in this study, we have found the ompleteness of sources that are detected at high significance in the ata (e.g. the sources at L L \u2217 that lead to the main conclusions in his paper) have completeness values close to unity.\n.2 Measuring the UV LF with the 1/ V max method\ne use the 1/ V max method (Rowan-Robinson 1968 ; Schmidt 1968 ) o measure the UV LF of our sample. We calculate the maximum bservable redshift z det by iteratively shifting the best-fitting SED of ach source in small steps of \u03b4z = 0.01 and convolving this with the election filter (the r , i , z bands) until the galaxy falls below the 5 \u03c3 etection threshold for the corresponding band and field it is located n. A maximum volume in which the object could have been detected V max ) is thus the co-moving volume contained within the range z min z < z max , where z min is the lower boundary of the redshift bin nd z max is either the maximum bound of the redshift bin or z det if t is found to be lower.

(2)\nTo balance number statistics with resolution in luminosity, we tilize four bin widths of M = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0. Bin widths of .0 are used at M UV < \u221223.5 for the z = 5 UV LF, while widths of .75 are used for z = 4 and z = 3 due to their greater number statistics. idths of 0.5 are used in the intermediate regime of \u221223.5 < M UV \u221223 and widths of 0.25 are used for M UV > \u221223. The absolute V magnitude ( M UV ) is calculated by convolving a 100 \u00c5 top-hat lter, centred at 1500 \u00c5 within the rest frame, on the best-fitting SED f each object. Bins fainter than our imposed completeness limits ontain large number of candidates due to the shape of the UV LF. his means the final sample used to measure the LFs in this study ontain fewer sources than the original selection procedure. The final ource counts used to derive the complete UV LF are 96 894 sources or z 3, 38 655 sources for z 4 and 7571 sources for z 5. he mean redshifts of the final samples are z = 3 . 1, z = 4 . 0, and = 4 . 8, respectively.\n.2.1 Cosmic variance\ns the UV LF is measured using a finite volume of the Universe nd three sight-lines, it can be susceptible to biases resulting from he large-scale structure of the Universe. Finite sight-lines can cause on-representative conclusions to be drawn and such an effect is ommonly referred to as \u2018cosmic variance\u2019. We follow the same rocedure implemented in Adams et al. ( 2020 ), which uses the online osmic variance calculator produced in Trenti & Stiavelli ( 2008 ) 2 to ompute the additional error due to cosmic variance. The total surv e y rea used to measure the LF decreases towards fainter luminosities s the shallower sub-fields fall below 50 per cent completeness. his means our cosmic variance estimations vary across the full uminosity range probed. At brighter intrinsic luminosities, the error udget is dominated by low number statistics, while cosmic variance ominates at fainter luminosities. To be conserv ati ve, we round up the alue obtained from the calculator to the nearest whole percentage oint, ranging from 3 per cent for bright z 3 luminosity bins to per cent for the faintest z 5 luminosity bins; the resultant error s then added in quadrature to our LF uncertainty resultant from ounting statistics in equation ( 2 ).\nRESU LTS\nn this section, we present the raw (binned) results of our measureents of the ultraviolet LF and the results of our subsequent fitting rocedures.\n.1 The binned UV LF at z = 3\u20135 ollowing the processes outlined in Section 3 , we obtain the UV LFs resented in Figs 7 , 8 , and 9 for the z = 3, z = 4, and z = 5 bins, espectiv ely. The ra w data points for each UV LF are provided in able A1 . W e display and use only the bins estimated to be greater han 50 per cent complete from at least two different sub-fields in our ompleteness simulation.\nNRAS 523, 327\u2013346 (2023)\nhttps:// www.ph.unimelb.edu.au/ \u223cmtr enti/cvc/CosmicVar iance.html\nt b t s\nFor the z = 3 UV LF, we are capable of measuring the number ensity of sources o v er a v ery wide range of intrinsic luminosities, panning \u221226.75 < M UV < \u221219.25 and six orders of magnitude in umber density. It encompasses the characteristic \u2018knee\u2019 of both the GN and galaxy LFs in addition to sampling the transition between GN and galaxy-dominated number counts. The measured number ensity of AGN is found to be slightly lower than the UV LF of AGN easured by Zhang et al. ( 2021 ). Ho we ver, this can be explained by he different redshift binning used between our two studies, with hang et al. ( 2021 ) using a bin of 2.0 < z < 3.5, resulting in a ower mean redshift. For the bright galaxies \u221223 < M UV < \u221221, e have very strong agreement with two primary observations of his regime by Parsa et al. ( 2016 ) and Bouwens et al. ( 2021 ). Our arge area enables us to more finely bin across this luminosity regime, roviding two to three times the resolution while maintaining smaller bservational errors. At the faint end, our galaxy LF is slightly lower han found by Parsa et al. ( 2016 ) and more closely matches the bservations from Bouwens et al. ( 2021 ); this could again be due to ur slightly higher mean redshift compared to these two studies, an spect we explore further in Section 4.2 .\nThe measured z = 4 UV LF spans a slightly smaller luminosity nterval than the z = 3 UV LF, with a final range of \u221226.75 < UV < \u221220. AGN measurements broadly agree with those from kiyama et al. ( 2018 ) and the transition between AGN and galaxyominated number counts matches recent observations presented in dams et al. ( 2020 ) and Harikane et al. ( 2021 ). Our observations re found to disagree with the findings from Boutsia et al. ( 2018 ), ho find an excess of faint-end AGN with M UV \u223c \u221223.5. We find hat the observation from Boutsia et al. ( 2018 ) that is uncorrected or completeness lies much closer to observations of this study and arikane et al. ( 2021 ), indicating that the completeness correction mployed within that study may be too strong. The number density f bright galaxies ( \u221223 < M UV < \u221221) are found to sit at the upper nd of the range previously found by past attempts to measure the V LF, agreeing more with Parsa et al. ( 2016 ) and Bouwens et al. 2021 ) than Finkelstein et al. ( 2015 ) and Harikane et al. ( 2021 ). greement with previous observations continues through the lower ntrinsic luminosities, with our measurements towards the centre of he distribution of number densities found in Finkelstein et al. ( 2015 ), arsa et al. ( 2016 ), and Bouwens et al. ( 2021 ). Finally, our z = 5 UV LF co v ers a luminosity range of \u221225.5 < UV < \u221220.5. The use of 10 deg 2 of sky is insufficient to probe the GN LF to higher luminosity due to the significantly lower number ensities that are present at this epoch when compared to z = 4 and = 3. The few ultra-luminous sources that we do measure at M UV \u221224 match the measurements of the AGN LF from Niida et al. 2020 ) and Harikane et al. ( 2021 ), which use substantially larger reas in their studies but lack the ancillary near-infrared information sed in this study. The number density and shape of the transition etween AGN and galaxy-dominated number counts match those easured by Harikane et al. ( 2021 ). As with our other LFs, the galaxy omponent is also in strong agreement with past observations from ouwens et al. ( 2021 ) and slightly higher than those of Finkelstein t al. ( 2015 ). The study by Finkelstein et al. ( 2015 ) attributes their ower number density of faint galaxies to the use of Spitzer data o remo v e contaminants in the form of low-redshift galaxies and\nilky Way brown dwarfs. With the use of ground-based near-infrared ata, we find that brown dwarfs should be sufficiently discarded up o redshifts of z = 5.2, beyond which optical colours of galaxies ecome too similar to dwarf stars and the VISTA bands do not probe o red enough wavelengths to capture the e xpected turn-o v er in the pectrum of a cold, dwarf star.\nFigure 7.

Since we do not differentiate AGN nd galaxies, we elect to simultaneously fit both the AGN and galaxy V LFs. The two primary models we use consist of a DPL for the GN and either a Schechter or DPL for the galaxy population. We do his to assess which of the DPL or Schechter functional forms better t the galaxy population. We combine our LF results with those of ther studies that probe luminosity re gimes be yond what is possible ith the data set used here. Data used to populate the very faint end f the galaxy population are obtained from Bouwens et al. ( 2021 ). hese data are included in order to provide tighter constraints on the aint-end slope ( \u03b1) of the galaxy LF. We find that the precision of the easured value of \u03b1 is impro v ed by a factor of 2 with the inclusion f the Bouwens et al. ( 2021 ) data as opposed to fitting our measured F alone. We only use the Bouwens et al. ( 2021 ) data that are fainter han the completeness limit for each of our UV LFs, providing total o v erage as faint as M UV = \u221216.\nFor the AGN UV LF, our z = 3 measurements probe beyond he \u2018knee\u2019, which enables us to fit the whole AGN LF with the se of our data points alone. Ho we ver, for z = 4 and z = 5, our ack of surv e y volume prevents us from constraining the bright-end lope and knee location. We subsequently employ the use of recent esults from wide-field Subaru/HyperSuprimeCam studies which o v er similar redshift bins to those used in this study. These are kiyama et al. ( 2018 ) and Niida et al. ( 2020 ) for the z 4 and redshift bins, respectively. We only utilize data points with M UV \u221223.5 from the AGN studies. This cut is used for two primary easons to ensure our UV LFs include all sources with rest-frame ltraviolet emission. First, the study conducted in Akiyama et al. 2018 ) uses a morphological selection procedure for their AGN ample. This fa v ourably selects strongly Type-I AGN which have\nNRAS 523, 327\u2013346 (2023)\noint-source morphology. In Bowler et al. ( 2021 ), we show that for agnitudes fainter than M UV > \u221223, such a morphological selection nderestimates the total number sources with AGN. Secondly, dams et al. ( 2020 ) have shown that galaxies begin to dominate he total number counts of the sources in the range \u221223.5 < M UV < 23 at these redshifts. Because the data points obtained from Bouwens et al. ( 2021 ) at he far faint end have slightly different mean redshifts to the UV LFs erived in this study, we make a simple modification that uses the volutionary model of the UV LF derived in Bouwens et al. ( 2021 ) to hift these data points to match the mean redshift of our observations. his is done in order to minimize any potential discontinuity from ffecting our results. We find that fitting to these modified points ead to higher quality fits with smaller \u03c72 values, indicating that iscontinuities between the two data sets have been reduced. Our fitting procedure uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) hat is implemented using EMCEE (F oreman-Macke y et al. 2013 ). The CMC has 500 w alk ers which each burn in for 100 000 steps before apping the posterior distribution for a further 20 000 steps. The alk ers are initially distributed uniformly o v er a wide parameter pace and priors for each parameter are set to be wide and uniform. he results of this procedure are presented in Table 2 for the three edshift bins. In the following subsections, we discuss our findings rom this fitting procedure.\n.2.1 Results of the z \u223c 3 UV LF fits or the z = 3 UV LF, our DPL + Sch model fits obtain a value f M \u2217 = \u221220 . 59 + 0 . 03 \u22120 . 03 with a faint-end slope of \u03b1 = \u22121 . 52 + 0 . 03 \u22120 . 03 for he galaxy UV LF. For the DPL + DPL model fits, we find the est-fitting values of M \u2217 = \u221221 . 18 + 0 . 03 \u22120 . 03 , \u03b1 = \u22121 . 85 + 0 . 02 \u22120 . 02 , and \u03b2 = 4 . 95 + 0 . 08 \u22120 . 09 , resulting in greater number of both the most luminous\nTable 2. The results of the MCMC fitting applied to the total UV LF in each of our redshift bins. The fit uses data points from Bouwens et al. ( 2021 ) fainter than probed by our measurements. Additionally, the z 4 and z 5 UV LFs use the measured AGN LF from Akiyama et al. ( 2018 ) and Niida et al. ( 2020 ), respectively. The first column lists the fitting parametrization used. Columns 2\u20135 are the best-fitting DPL parameters for the AGN LF. Columns 6\u20139 show the best-fitting LBG parameters, either for a Schechter function or DPL. The final columns show the \u03c72 and reduced \u03c72 of the fit. We modify the data points from Bouwens et al. ( 2021 ) using their parametrized evolution of the LF parameters to shift the mean redshift to match the mean redshift of our data.\nFunction log 10 ( AGN ) M \u2217AGN \u03b1AGN \u03b2AGN log 10 ( ) M \u2217 \u03b1 \u03b2 \u03c72 \u03c72 red\nmag \u22121 Mpc \u22123 mag mag \u22121 Mpc \u22123 mag\nz = 3.1 DPL + Sch \u22127 . 46 + 0 . 65 \u22121 . 08 \u221226 . 67 + 0 . 99 \u22122 . 12 \u22122 . 10 + 0 . 22 \u22120 . 14 \u22124 . 10 + 1 . 44 \u22121 . 30 \u22122 . 63 + 0 . 03 \u22120 . 03 \u221220 . 59 + 0 . 03 \u22120 . 03 \u22121 . 52 + 0 . 03 \u22120 . 03 \u2013 70.83 4.17 DPL + DPL \u22126 . 57 + 0 . 21 \u22120 . 24 \u221225 . 57 + 0 . 47 \u22120 . 37 \u22121 . 37 + 0 . 23 \u22120 . 23 \u22124 . 91 + 1 . 37 \u22121 . 89 \u22123 . 20 + 0 . 03 \u22120 . 03 \u221221 . 18 + 0 . 03 \u22120 . 03 \u22121 . 85 + 0 . 02 \u22120 . 02 \u22124 . 95 + 0 . 08 \u22120 . 09 28.75 1.80 z = 4.0 DPL + Sch \u22127 . 90 + 0 . 15 \u22120 . 11 \u221227 . 34 + 0 . 20 \u22120 . 14 \u22122 . 10 + 0 . 06 \u22120 . 05 \u22124 . 64 + 0 . 44 \u22120 . 53 \u22123 . 00 + 0 . 03 \u22120 . 03 \u221221 . 11 + 0 . 04 \u22120 . 04 \u22121 . 80 + 0 . 03 \u22120 . 03 \u2014 74.32 2.06 DPL + DPL \u22127 . 77 + 0 . 21 \u22120 . 15 \u221227 . 18 + 0 . 29 \u22120 . 19 \u22122 . 02 + 0 . 10 \u22120 . 07 \u22124 . 34 + 0 . 43 \u22120 . 51 \u22123 . 62 + 0 . 04 \u22120 . 04 \u221221 . 68 + 0 . 05 \u22120 . 04 \u22122 . 10 + 0 . 03 \u22120 . 03 \u22125 . 29 + 0 . 14 \u22120 . 15 84.44 2.41 z = 4.8 DPL + Sch \u22128 . 74 + 0 . 12 \u22120 . 11 \u221227 . 65 + 0 . 13 \u22120 . 13 \u22122 . 23 + 0 . 10 \u22120 . 08 \u22126 . 54 + 1 . 05 \u22120 . 95 \u22122 . 88 + 0 . 04 \u22120 . 04 \u221220 . 86 + 0 . 05 \u22120 . 05 \u22121 . 57 + 0 . 06 \u22120 . 05 \u2013 43.86 1.46 DPL + DPL \u22128 . 65 + 0 . 13 \u22120 . 12 \u221227 . 58 + 0 . 14 \u22120 . 13 \u22122 . 12 + 0 . 12 \u22120 . 10 \u22126 . 31 + 1 . 04 \u22121 . 04 \u22123 . 57 + 0 . 05 \u22120 . 05 \u221221 . 60 + 0 . 05 \u22120 . 05 \u22121 . 94 + 0 . 04 \u22120 . 04 \u22125 . 73 + 0 . 18 \u22120 . 19 24.04 0.83\na T e p t A fi o L s p c p c t i\nt ( j T > I A d h < d o A i a b t w p fi p a s M\na A m\nf h T c ( a g\n4\nF M g v A g u f w\ng p p r s s 2 w s l s c T a t w\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/523/1/327/7153338 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024 nd the faintest galaxies compared to the Schechter parametrization. he bright end of the AGN LF is poorly constrained, but the faint nd is measured to be \u03b1AGN = \u22122 . 10 + 0 . 22 \u22120 . 14 , when using the Schechter arametrization for the galaxies, and \u03b1AGN = \u22121 . 37 + 0 . 23 \u22120 . 23 when using he DPL parametrization for the galaxies, showing that more UV-faint GN are required if the galaxy UV LF exponentially falls off. We nd that the reduced \u03c72 ( \u03c72 red ) values at the peak of the posterior are v er a factor of 2 lower when using a DPL to describe the galaxy UV F as opposed to using a Schechter function. Detailed examination hows that our observations at M UV = \u221219.125 and the two faintest oints from Bouwens et al. ( 2021 ) at M UV \u223c \u221217 are the largest ontributors to the total \u03c72 . These results show a discontinuity is still resent between the two data sets, even after our adjustments. This ould be the consequence of a different selection function within he redshift bin or an underestimation of the total cosmic variance mpacting either study. We find that the DPL + DPL results produce a faint-end slope for he AGN UV LF that agrees with the findings presented in Zhang et al. 2021 ) ( \u03b1AGN = \u22121 . 26 + 0 . 10 \u22120 . 08 ). The work in Zhang et al. ( 2021 ) fits for ust the Type-I (broad line) AGN population. Ho we v er, the y note that ype-II AGN (narrow line) become dominant in the AGN LF at M UV \u221222, a regime where our LF is dominated by star-forming galaxies. t is thus no surprise that our fits replicate the LF slope of Type-I GN. Compared to the UV LFs derived in Harikane et al. ( 2021 ), the ifferences between our measurements are primarily driven by the igher number density of bright, star-forming galaxies found at M UV M \u2217 in Moutard et al. ( 2020 ), the source of the bright-end galaxy LF ata points used in Harikane et al. ( 2021 ). The higher number density f galaxies at M UV \u223c\u221223 leads to a transition between the galaxy and GN LF that is less sharp than found by our observations. This results\nn Harikane et al. ( 2021 ) finding a value of \u03b1AGN \u223c \u22121.59 when using DPL to describe the galaxy population, steeper than found here and y Zhang et al. ( 2021 ). The cause of these differing results across the ransition between the galaxy and AGN LFs can be attributed to the ay in which the absolute magnitudes are measured. In this study, we lace a 100 \u00c5 top hat across 1500 \u00c5 in the rest frame using the besttting SED, while in Moutard et al. ( 2020 ) the closest observer frame hotometric band is used, which have more complicated shapes and re vulnerable to being affected by sources with steep ultraviolet pectral slopes. This results in an additional source of scatter in the UV measurement, leading to an artificial increase in the number of\npparently luminous galaxies brightward of the knee (see appendix of dams et al. 2020 , for an explanation of the differences in M UV easurements and the shallower galaxy-AGN transition). When the galaxy population is instead modelled by a Schechter unction, the number density of faint AGN is estimated to be much igher in order to account for the more rapid decline in galaxies. his results in a faint-end slope that is much steeper than in the DPL ase, with \u03b1AGN = \u22122 . 10 + 0 . 22 \u22120 . 14 . This diversion from the Zhang et al. 2021 ) AGN LF results, derived from spectroscopic measurements, nd the lower quality of fit (higher \u03c72 red ) provides evidence that the alaxy UV LF is better described by a DPL at z \u223c 3.\n.2.2 Results from the z \u223c 4 UV LF fits or the z = 4 UV LF, our DPL + Sch model fits obtain a value of\n\u2217 = \u221221 . 11 + 0 . 04 \u22120 . 04 with a faint-end slope of \u03b1 = \u22121 . 80 + 0 . 03 \u22120 . 03 for the alaxy UV LF. For the DPL + DPL model fits, we find best-fitting alues of M \u2217 = \u221221 . 68 + 0 . 05 \u22120 . 04 , \u03b1 = \u22122 . 10 + 0 . 03 \u22120 . 03 , and \u03b2 = \u22125 . 29 + 0 . 14 \u22120 . 15 . s with the z = 3 UV LF, the DPL parametrization predicts more alaxies at either extreme of the z = 4 galaxy UV LF compared to sing a Schechter parametrization. A key finding is that there are ewer galaxies with M UV < \u221222 at z 3 compared to z 4, which e discuss in more detail in Section 5.4 . For the AGN UV LF, we find that both parametrizations of the alaxy LF that we fit provide consistent measurements for the DPL arameters used to describe the AGN UV LF. Our fitting procedure roduces faint-end slopes that are quite steep with \u03b1AGN < \u22122. This esult contrasts with the findings of the original Akiyama et al. ( 2018 ) tudy ( \u03b1AGN \u223c 1.3), but broadly agrees with other studies that have ought to simultaneously fit for both AGN and galaxies (Ste v ans et al. 018 ; Adams et al. 2020 ; Harikane et al. 2021 ). This disagreement ith Akiyama et al. ( 2018 ) can be attributed to the morphological election that they employ, which Bowler et al. ( 2021 ) show could ead to an underestimation of the number of sources with AGN ignatures at M UV > \u221223 (and one of the reasons we employed uts on which data points from Akiyama et al. 2018 were used). he differing faint-end slope for the AGN LFs can subsequently be ttributed to the handling of sources that blur the boundary between he definitions of star-forming and AGN-dominated UV emission hen spectroscopic data are lacking.\nMNRAS 523, 327\u2013346 (2023)\nM\no p a f f A B e s f t U\np i P B u M i d F e c t F m F a T p e 2 b O z 3 r r n c i\n4\nF a \u2212 w a t t p\no a b o w e\nt b i ( T t s i a\nT t p i b n t e fi w a b c (\n5\nT m i s m e\n5\nA e 3 e t l p o W d m l q t c p o \u223c \u2212\nd t c s n m\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/523/1/327/7153338 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nWhile the z \u223c 3 UV LF has a clear distinction between the quality f the fits of the Schechter and DPL functional forms for the galaxy opulation, at z \u223c 4 the different models are lower in the quality of fit nd more comparable in their significance. In contrast to the results rom z = 3 (and z = 5), the z = 4 UV LF shows that the Schechter unction is slightly more fa v ourable than the DPL functional form. s with the z = 3 UV LF, we find that our modifications to the ouwens et al. ( 2021 ) points reduces the discontinuity at the faintnd as well as the o v erall \u03c72 . Ho we ver, we find that the data points traddling this transition and the f ar f aint-end are still responsible or around half of the total \u03c72 contributions. For M UV < \u221221, the ypical \u03c72 contributions are around 1, indicating that the rest of the V LF is fit well. The far faint end of the z = 4 UV LF has a greater tension between ast observational studies than the other redshift bins considered n this study, with the results from Finkelstein et al. ( 2015 ) and arsa et al. ( 2016 ) clearly offset to lower number density than ouwens et al. ( 2021 ). To assess what impact the choice of study sed to populate the faint-end has on our results, we repeat our CMC fitting procedure using the Finkelstein et al. ( 2015 ) data nstead of Bouwens et al. ( 2021 ). The results of this procedure are isplayed in Appendix B . We find that the AGN UV LF is unaffected. or the galaxy UV LF, we find that the Schechter parametrization xperiences significant shifts towards higher values of \u2217, fainter haracteristic magnitudes, and flatter faint-end slopes. Compared o the results obtained with Bouwens et al. ( 2021 ), the fits using inkelstein et al. ( 2015 ) data find \u03b4 = 0.13 dex, \u03b4M \u2217 = 0.19 ag, and the faint-end slope flattens from \u03b1 = 1.80 to \u03b1 = 1.49. or the DPL + DPL fits, we find that the galaxy faint-end slope is lso flatter (with \u03b4\u03b1 = 0.25) compared to Bouwens et al. ( 2021 ). he remaining parameters shift to a similar degree as the Schechter arametrization, with \u03b4 = 0.19 dex, \u03b4M \u2217 = 0.19 mag. The brightnd slope changes by a lower significance, with the shift around \u03c3 . This shows that the bright-end slope is largely constrained y our new measurements of the galaxy bright-end and \u2018knee\u2019. verall, the fits with the Finkelstein et al. ( 2015 ) data points at = 4 provide a smoother evolution between our other fits at z = and z = 5, but it is clear that systematics at the faint-end still emain at z = 4, leading to uncertainties in the faint-end. With the ecent releases of the first data from the JWST we will soon see ew capabilities for impro v ed photometric redshifts, spectroscopic ompleteness, and more at M UV > \u221220, which will help alleviate this ssue.\n.2.3 The z \u223c 5 UV LF fits or the z = 5 UV LF, our DPL + Sch model fits obtain value of M \u2217 = \u221220 . 86 + 0 . 05 \u22120 . 05 with a faint-end slope of \u03b1 = 1 . 57 + 0 . 06 \u22120 . 05 for the galaxy UV LF. For the DPL + DPL model fits, e find best-fitting values of M \u2217 = \u221221 . 60 + 0 . 05 \u22120 . 05 , \u03b1 = \u22121 . 94 + 0 . 04 \u22120 . 04 , nd \u03b2 = \u22125 . 73 + 0 . 18 \u22120 . 19 . As with the previous two bins considered, he DPL + DPL parametrization results in greater numbers of he brightest and faintest galaxies compared to the Schechter arametrization. The Schechter fits to the galaxy LF produce a slightly different set f results compared to those obtained in Bouwens et al. ( 2021 ), with flatter faint-end slope and fainter M \u2217 luminosity. This is driven y our slightly higher number density at the faint extrema of our bservations ( M UV = \u221220.5). The DPL parameters that we fit agree ell with the fits conducted in Bowler et al. ( 2020 ) and Harikane t al. ( 2021 ). We find the transition between the galaxy and AGN LF\nNRAS 523, 327\u2013346 (2023)\no be slightly steeper than found by Harikane et al. ( 2021 ), driven y their slightly higher number density at M UV \u223c \u221223. This results n a shallower bright-end slope of \u03b2 = \u22124 . 9 + 0 . 08 \u22120 . 08 in Harikane et al. 2021 ) compared to the \u03b2 = \u22125 . 73 + 0 . 18 \u22120 . 19 value obtained in this study. he fitting procedures for our z = 5 UV LF show a preference for he DPL functional form to describe the galaxy population, with a ignificantly lower \u03c72 red value compared to when a Schechter function s used. Ho we ver, using the DPL functional form can be considered n o v erfit to the data, with \u03c72 red < 1.\nFor the AGN LF, we find similar results to those found at z \u223c 4. he results of both functional forms provide parameters describing\nhe UV LF of AGN that are consistent at the \u223c1 \u03c3 level. The fits roduce very steep values for the faint-end slope (with \u03b1AGN < \u22122), ndicating that there are high numbers of AGN at M UV > \u221223. The right-end slope \u03b2AGN is largely unconstrained due to the very low umber densities of AGN brighter than M UV < \u221228 at this time and he limited surv e y volumes probed by our study and that of Niida t al. ( 2020 ). The steep faint-end slope is in agreement with the ts conducted by Niida et al. ( 2020 ), who find \u03b1AGN = \u22122 . 0 + 0 . 40 \u22120 . 03 hen the bright end is left free (as opposed to being fixed to particular value, \u03b2AGN = \u22122.9 in their case). Similarly, our est-fitting parameters are close to the results derived from the ombined AGN and galaxy LF fit conducted in Harikane et al. 2021 ).\nDI SCUSSI ON\nhe previous section discusses the results of our UV LF measureents in a base context of comparing different parametrizations for\nts modelling and direct comparisons to measurements from other tudies. In this section, we expand discussion to how these new easurements of the UV LF impact our understanding of the covolution of galaxies and AGN.\n.1 The evolving faint-end slope of the AGN LF\ns shown in Fig. 9 and in our fitting in Table 2 , we see a strong volution in the number density of AGN between z 5 and z . To explore this further, we examine the luminosity-dependent volution of the faint-end slope of the AGN UV LF by comparing he simple vertical change in number density as a function of absolute uminosity. Such an evolution can be described with an \u2018evolution arameter\u2019 ( k ), which has been commonly used in previous studies f AGN at high redshifts (Jiang et al. 2016 ; Yang et al. 2018 ; ang et al. 2019 ; Niida et al. 2020 ). This parameter follows the efinition k = log 10 ( z 1 / z 2 ) / ( z 1 \u2212 z 2 ), where z 1 and z 2 are the ean redshifts of two LFs used for comparison. The redshift and uminosity dependence of this evolution parameter provides another uantitative method to measure the change in the faint-end slope of he AGN LF. The measurement of k and its subsequent error margin is alculated by randomly sampling the posterior outputs of the MCMC rocedure for each redshift bin and examining the spread of k values btained by comparing neighbouring redshift bins ( z \u223c 3\u20134 and z\n4\u20135) with each other at three different luminosities ( \u221226, \u221225, 24). The results of this calculation are shown in Table 3 . Our measured values of k clearly show that the evolution in number\nensity of UV-faint AGN is much more rapid at higher redshifts; his is further emphasized when examining other studies that have ompared the AGN LF in the range z \u223c 5\u20136 and find that k is stronger till ( k \u223c \u22120.82\u2013\u22120.95 Matsuoka et al. 2019 ; Niida et al. 2020 ). The umber densities of UV-faint AGN rise by just under two orders of agnitude in the 1 Gyr that separates z 6 and z 3, yet the first\nTable 3.

When we examine the luminosity dependence on the evolution of he k parameter, we find there are no significant trends present. This ndicates that there is a near uniform rise in the number of AGN in the ange \u221226 < M UV < \u221224 in the range 4 < z < 5. In the range 3 < z 4, the growth in number density of AGN slows down significantly. n particular, bright AGN of M UV = \u221226 are found to be consistent n number density between z = 3 and z = 4, while fainter AGN still ho w gro wth in their number density. This drives the flattening of the aint-end slope at z = 3 and shifts of the knee location towards fainter uminosities. Our results are consistent with the evolution proposed n Niida et al. ( 2020 , see their fig. 10), who combined a number of tudies to explore the luminosity-dependent evolution of the AGN F across a wide range of redshifts (0.5 < z < 6; Richards et al. 2006 ; iana et al. 2008 ; Croom et al. 2009 ; McGreer et al. 2013 ; Akiyama t al. 2018 ; Matsuoka et al. 2019 ). Here, they also report that AGN umber density rises more rapidly at higher redshifts before their volution flattens of f and e v entually turns o v er, leading to a decrease n the number of UV luminous AGN in the modern Universe. The ey finding was that brighter AGN peak in their number density at arlier times than fainter AGN. Those with a luminosity M UV = \u221226 eak around z = 3, while AGN with M UV = \u221224 peak in number ensity closer to z = 2. This is consistent with theoretical predictions f the combined effects of AGN downsizing and dust obscuration e.g. Fanidakis et al. 2012 ; Hirschmann et al. 2014 ). To explore whether the excess in the number density of bright alaxies at z \u2265 7 (reported in Bowler et al. 2014 ) can be explained by aint AGN, we fit a simple linear model in (1 + z) to the value of k and xtrapolate to higher redshifts. For this model, we use the k values erived in this study and include those derived for the difference etween the z = 5\u20136 AGN UV LF in Niida et al. ( 2020 ). At M UV = 24, the slope of the evolution in k ( \u03b4k \u03b4z ) is found to be \u22120.40 \u00b1 0.03\n\u22120.42 \u00b1 0.04) when using the DPL + Sch (DPL + DPL) functional orms. This predicts a value of k between LFs measured at z = 6\u2013 to be around k = \u22121.3. Using the z = 6 UV LF measurements rom Matsuoka et al. ( 2019 ), which have a number density of around \u00d7 10 \u22128 Mpc \u22123 mag \u22121 , as a baseline for AGN number densities t z = 6, we estimate the number density of AGN at M UV = \u221224 ill be approximately 5 \u00d7 10 \u221210 Mpc \u22123 mag \u22121 based on this trend. his is o v er two orders of magnitude less than the number density f galaxies observed at M UV = \u221223 in Bowler et al. ( 2014 ). Even ith a steep faint-end slope ( \u03b1AGN < \u22122), the number of AGN t this time is insufficient to explain the excess in number counts eported by Bowler et al. ( 2014 ). Extrapolating this trend to even igher redshift, we would not expect unobscured, Type-I AGN to be ignificant contaminants of current measurements of the z \u2265 7 galaxy\nF. This is in disagreement with recent results from Leethochawalit t al. ( 2022 ), whom claim to observe a substantial number density of ources with M UV < \u221222 at z = 8. This was attributed to AGN, but the umber densities required would be orders of magnitude more than he observed evolution of the AGN UV LF at lower redshifts predict. ur conclusions here are also further supported by the study of inkelstein & Bagley ( 2022 ), whose compilation of AGN studies and redictions towards higher redshifts also find that AGN are unable o account for the excess in highly luminous objects found in galaxy F studies at z > 7.\n.2 Ionizing emissivity of AGN in the epoch immediately ost-reionization\nkey debate regarding the reionization epoch is the contribution f ionizing photons from AGN compared to the fainter, but more umerous, star-forming galaxies. Evidence has been posed both for e.g. Giallongo et al. 2015 , 2019 ; Madau & Haardt 2015 ; Yoshiura t al. 2017 ; Bosch-Ramon 2018 ; Dayal et al. 2020 ; Torres-Alb \u0300a, osch-Ramon & Iw asaw a 2020 ) and against (e.g. Stark 2016 ; \u2019Aloisio et al. 2017 ; Qin et al. 2017 ; Hassan et al. 2018 ; Mitra, houdhury & Ferrara 2018 ; Parsa et al. 2018 ; Zeltyn & Trakhtenbrot 022 ) scenarios where AGN provide significant contributions to the eionizing process in the early Universe. Here, we calculate the missivity of UV photons at 1500 \u00c5 for the two populations by ntegrating the fits to our LFs in the luminosity range of \u221230 < UV < \u221215 [ \u03c11500 = \u222b \u221215 \u221230 ( M ) L ( M )d M ]. Comparing the result rom integrating the galaxy and AGN UV LFs separately, we nd that galaxies generate a factor of 40 (100) times more UV 1500 \u00c5) photons than AGN at z = 5 when using the Schechter DPL) functional form for the galaxy population. Similarly, galaxies enerate 33 (60) times more photons at z = 4. This shows that he steeper faint-end slopes of the AGN LF found when using the chechter functional form for the galaxy population results in more ignificant AGN contributions to the total amount of ultraviolet light t this time.\nThe abo v e calculation assumes that AGN and LBGs have the same scape fraction ( f esc ) of ultraviolet photons into the IGM, which may ot be the case. Some studies have assumed escape fractions of unity or objects classed as AGN (Giallongo et al. 2015 ; Ste v ans et al. 018 ) and this is supported by observations that show generally arge escape fractions for these sources ( > 50 per cent; Cristiani t al. 2016 ; Grazian et al. 2018 ; Romano et al. 2019 ). Ho we ver, t is unclear if this trend holds towards fainter luminosities. For alaxies, there are a variety of results that show the escape fraction s dependent on redshift, stellar mass, halo mass, and more, with bservations measuring escape fractions from the sub-per cent level o o v er 30 per cent (e.g. Cooke et al. 2014 ; Grazian et al. 2017 ; Steidel\nMNRAS 523, 327\u2013346 (2023)\nM\nFigure 10. The emissivity of hydrogen ionizing photons originating from AGN sources. The blue line from Madau & Haardt ( 2015 ) presents a scenario where AGN are capable of driving the reionization of the Universe without the need for contributions from star-forming galaxies. For our data points, the downwards pointing triangles are calculated from the Sch + DPL fits calculated in this study and the upwards pointing triangles are from the DPL + DPL fits. The opposite is the case for the Ste v ans et al. ( 2018 ) results, where they find their DPL + DPL fits provide a higher total emissivity. The red and black lines linking our data points and those of Ste v ans et al. ( 2018 ) show the range of emissivities between those found by the Sch + DPL and DPL + DPL parametrizations. The data points for the various observational studies are extracted from fig. 1 of Madau & Haardt ( 2015 ), who analyses each set of observations in a self-consistent way. The data used originate from Bongiorno et al. ( 2007 ); Schulze, Wisotzki & Husemann ( 2009 ); Glikman et al. ( 2011 ); Masters et al. ( 2012 ); and Giallongo et al. ( 2015 ). Additional data points from more recent studies have been added from Giallongo et al. ( 2019 ). We also show the results of integrating the galaxy UV LF under the same process but with escape fractions f esc = 0.1, 1.0 as the red crosses. We find that the Schechter and DPL functional forms do not cause a significant difference in the estimated emissivity of galaxies.\ne 2\na l i f S e i \u223c o s e c c \u2212 e\nc r E m m f c S f t t w\nt p 5 fi p < p a l o i m r ( e c b\n5 U\nW u d e c b L ( t\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/523/1/327/7153338 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nt al. 2018 ; Vanzella et al. 2018 ; Fletcher et al. 2019 ; Bian & Fan 020 ; Izotov et al. 2021 ; Begley et al. 2022 ). To explore the AGN budget of ionizing photons further, we conduct simple conversion from \u03c11500 to \u03c1912 , the emissivity at the Lyman imit, for the AGN population following the same procedure as used n Ste v ans et al. ( 2018 ). Here, we assume that the spectral slope ollo ws a po wer law of \u03b1\u03bd = \u22121.41 in the range 1000\u20131500 \u00c5 (Shull, te v ans & Danforth 2012 ) and \u03b1\u03bd = \u22120.83 for 912\u20131000 \u00c5 (Ste v ans t al. 2014 ). We note here that Ste v ans et al. ( 2018 ) explore the mpact of these SED slope assumptions and find it has an impact of 10 per cent on the final \u03c1912 value if different assumptions, based on ther observational studies, are used. For closer comparison to other tudies that perform this calculation (Madau & Haardt 2015 ; Ste v ans t al. 2018 ), we integrate the UV LF down to M UV < \u221218 when alculating \u03c1912 for AGN. For a simple comparison, we conduct this alculation for galaxies too, assuming an ultraviolet slope of \u03b1\u03bd = 1.7 (Bouwens et al. 2014 ; Wilkins et al. 2016 ) and two values for the scape fraction ( f esc = 0.1, 1.0). The results are presented in Fig. 10 . This analysis is once again an optimistic calculation for the ontribution of AGN to the number of hydrogen ionizing photons eaching the neutral IGM due to our assumption of a f esc = 1. ven with this optimism, we find that the emissivity is below that easured by Giallongo et al. ( 2015 ) and subsequently used in the odelling conducted by Madau & Haardt ( 2015 ). Our estimate is ound to be broadly consistent with the results from other studies o v ering this time period (Glikman et al. 2011 ; Masters et al. 2012 ; te v ans et al. 2018 ; Giallongo et al. 2019 ) and is greater than a actor of 10 below the emissivity of galaxies when measured under he same assumptions. The use of a Schechter function to model he galaxy population leads to greater numbers of faint-end AGN, hich results in a larger total emissivity (our downwards pointing\nNRAS 523, 327\u2013346 (2023)\nv\nriangles) than when using the DPL functional form (our upwards ointing triangles). This is at its most pronounced at z = 3 and z = , while at z = 4 the results are comparable due to the consistent ts to the AGN LF that we measure. Within uncertainties, it is still lausible that AGN alone could sustain hydrogen reionization at z 5. Their total contributions to the later stages of the reionization rocess should not be entirely discounted until more is understood bout the number density of very faint AGN ( M UV > \u221224) and their eakage of Lyman Continuum photons. With the simple assumptions f f esc = 1.0 for AGN and f esc = 0.1 for star-forming galaxies, it s likely that a combination of galaxy and AGN contributions can aintain reionization at lower redshifts. At z > 5, the extrapolated apid evolution of the AGN LF observed in this study and others Matsuoka et al. 2019 ; Niida et al. 2020 ) will generate expected missivities that are lower than at z = 5, indicating that AGN ontributions deeper within the reionization epoch at z > 7 will e relatively small compared to galaxies.\n.3 The transition between AGN and star-forming-dominated V emission\nith a parametrized ultraviolet LF measured for both the AGN poplation and star-forming galaxies, the question of which population ominates number counts at different absolute luminosities can be xplored. In Fig. 11 , we show the results of using our measured LFs to alculate the luminosity-dependent AGN fraction in our three redshift ins. Here, we find that the DPL parametrization for the galaxy UV F predicts a higher number of ultra-luminous, star-forming galaxies M UV < \u221223) compared to the Schechter parametrization. This leads o a more gradual shift between AGN and galaxy-dominated ultraiolet emission (spanning two and a half magnitudes), as opposed to\nFigure 11.

The use of the DPL functional form for galaxies is found to predict small evolution in the AGN fraction with redshift. Here, AGN ominance extends towards lower luminosities at lower redshifts. o we ver, current statistical and systematic errors on the faint end of he AGN LF mean this result is presently insignificant. The Schechter unctional form, ho we v er, e xhibits a strong shift between z \u223c 4 and \u223c 3, brought on by the combination of the rise in faint AGN umber counts and the significant fall in the M \u2217 value for the starorming galaxies across this time period. The cause of this evolution an be attributed to the onset of widespread quenching in massive, uminous galaxies at z < 4 resulting in the measured turno v er in he star-forming main sequence (Muzzin et al. 2013 ; Tomczak et al. 016 ; Davidzon et al. 2017 ; McLeod et al. 2021 ). To answer the question regarding the true number densities of ltra-luminous, star-forming galaxies ( M UV < \u221222), the differences n the predicted AGN fractions between our models can be exploited. he region of parameter space where the predictions of the AGN raction between the DPL or Schechter function are found to differ he most is in the range \u221224 < M UV < \u221223. Consequently, a ighly complete spectroscopic surv e y targeting a population of ources in this luminosity regime has the potential to shed light n which parametrization of the LF best describes the intrinsic opulation. The studies by Ono et al. ( 2018 ), Boutsia et al. ( 2018 ), nd Bowler et al. ( 2021 ) explored this possibility using both new nd le gac y spectroscopic data sets; ho we ver, such data sets present ample sizes that are too small and lacking in completeness for any ignificant results to presently be determined. In order to successfully ake the distinction between the two parametrizations, a targeted pectroscopic surv e y, perhaps combined with more detailed SED tting to distinguish the AGN and star-formation components (e.g. horne et al. 2022 , at lower redshifts), is likely required.\n.4 Evolution of the galaxy UV LF\nn contrast to the AGN LF, the evolution in the LF of star-forming alaxies is much more mild across the redshift range of z = 3 to = 5. Compared to the studies undertaken with Hubble surv e ys\nnd the COSMOS field (e.g. Finkelstein et al. 2015 ; Parsa et al. 016 ; Bouwens et al. 2021 ), the volumes probed in this study are ignificantly larger. This enables us to measure the bright end of the alaxy UV LF to much greater precision, placing tight constraints on he bright-end slope and the value of the characteristic luminosity M \u2217. he key finding of this study is that the number density of luminous alaxies M UV < \u221221 increases from z = 5 to z = 4, but then decreases etween z \u223c 4 and z \u223c 3. This is subsequently observed in the fit arameter M \u2217 in both Schechter and DPL functional forms, which ncreases at higher redshifts and then decreases at z \u223c 3.\nEvolution in the UV LF of galaxies, and subsequently the arameters used to describe it, is dependent on a number of hysical factors that go v ern galaxy evolution. Star formation rate, uenching mechanisms, and dust obscuration all affect its shape and ll potentially have dependence on time. The excess of galaxies at UV < \u221222 present in the more fa v oured DPL functional fits could hallenge our understanding of these processes. Before these can be onsidered ho we ver, the ef fects of gravitational lensing may need o be taken into account. The studies of Ono et al. ( 2018 ), Bowler t al. ( 2015 , 2020 ), and Harikane et al. ( 2021 ) note that the excess f ultra-luminous galaxies is more than what can be attributed to ensing effects from foreground g alaxies. To investig ate this further, e assume that our measured UV LF is described by a Schechter unction that is convolved with a simple lensing model. We conduct his work by following the lensing prescription developed across the tudies Wyithe et al. ( 2011 ), Barone-Nugent et al. ( 2015 ), Ono et al. 2018 ), and Harikane et al. ( 2021 ).\nWe recalculate the \u03c72 using our observed UV LF o v er the agnitude range \u221223 < M UV < \u221220 using this new lensed Schechter unction and compare the results to the initial Schechter and DPL ts to the galaxy population. We find that the predicted number f luminous galaxies with M UV < \u221222.5 increases by only a arginal amount between the original Schechter model and the ensed Schechter model. This leads to small changes in the quality of he fit of \u03b4\u03c72 \u223c 1. This is in agreement with the results of Ono t al. ( 2018 ), who find that strong lensing is most impactful at edshifts higher than probed in this study. This is because the lensing ptical depth increases with redshift due to the increasing probability f line-of-sight alignment with foreground, lower redshift galaxies Takahashi et al. 2011 ; Barone-Nugent et al. 2015 ).\nAs lensing is unable to explain the presence of these ultra-luminous alaxies, their existence can indicate a lack of quenching and/or ust obscuration at this time. The evolution of the bright-end slope\ncan be used to gain further insight into these processes. The volution found by Bowler et al. ( 2020 ) indicates that \u03b2 steepens ith time, keeping the number density of ultra-luminous galaxies t M UV \u223c \u221223 nearly constant. They postulate that this gradual teepening of the bright-end slope can be attributed to increased ust content in galaxies towards lower redshifts. As is shown in ig. 12 , our observations agree well with this evolutionary model ntil z 3, where we observe the values of M \u2217 and the bright-end lope ( \u03b2) experience a turn o v er and rev ersal in their evolution in he range 3 < z < 4. This coincides with the onset of significant ractions of passivity in massive galaxies (stellar mass log ( M \u2217/ M ) 10.5) as time advances from z \u223c 4.5 to z \u223c 2.75, leading to a urno v er in the star-forming main sequence at the high-mass end Muzzin et al. 2013 ; Tomczak et al. 2016 ; Davidzon et al. 2017 ;\ncLeod et al. 2021 ). Consequently, the most massive and luminous alaxies see a larger reduction in star formation rates which will ltimately reduce their ultraviolet luminosities. Hence, the impact of ust attenuation may be an important driver in the evolution of the right end of the UV LF at high redshifts ( z > 4), but quenching\nMNRAS 523, 327\u2013346 (2023)\nM\nFigure 12.

C O N C L U S I O N S n this work, we have presented new measurements of the ultraviolet F in the range 2.75 < z < 5.2. The sample was selected using a ighly complete and robust SED fitting procedure that was applied o \u223c10 deg 2 of deep optical and near-infrared photometry in the OSMOS, XMM-LSS, and E-CDFS extragalactic fields. These bservations were combined with other studies that complement he dynamical range of luminosity and surv e y volume probed by ur study, enabling the ultraviolet LF to be constrained from \u221228.5 M UV < \u221216 and co v ering eight orders of magnitude in number ensity. The key findings of this study can be summarized as follows: (i) The choice of parametrization used to describe the galaxy opulation (a DPL or Schechter function) remains difficult to discern y purely photometric means. The z \u223c 3 and z \u223c 5 UV LFs shows strong preference for a DPL functional form. Ho we ver, the results rom z \u223c 4 show the qualities of fits remain too close to fa v our ne o v er the other. A simple lensing model is found to be unable to ignificantly impro v e the quality of the Schechter-based fits.\n(ii) The number density of ultra-luminous galaxies at z \u223c 3 is ower than that of z \u223c 4 and fit values of M \u2217 decrease dramatically in he range 3 < z < 4. This result supports studies that find an earlier urno v er in the value of M \u2217 (Weisz, Johnson & Conroy 2014 ; Parsa t al. 2016 ). Comparisons to simple evolutionary models from Parsa t al. ( 2016 ), Bowler et al. ( 2020 ), and Bouwens et al. ( 2021 ) indicate hat z \u223c 4 is a key time period where the evolution of the UV LF xperiences a rev ersal in the growth in the number density of the ost UV-luminous galaxies. This is likely due to more widespread uenching in the population of massive galaxies in the range 2.75 < < 4.5 (Muzzin et al. 2013 ; Tomczak et al. 2016 ; Davidzon et al. 017 ; McLeod et al. 2021 ), indicating that dust attenuation may drive\nNRAS 523, 327\u2013346 (2023)\nhe evolution of the bright end of the galaxy UV LF at high redshifts z > 4, Bowler et al. 2020 ), while the quenching of star formation ecomes more impactful at lower redshfits ( z < 4).\n(iii) Utilizing the differing predictions in the AGN fraction with bsolute UV luminosity is required to solve the above issue in iscerning which of the Schechter or DPL parametrizations better escribes the galaxy population. We find that a spectroscopic camaign targeting objects with an absolute luminosity of \u221224 < M UV \u221223.25, expanding upon work started by Boutsia et al. ( 2018 ), no et al. ( 2018 ), and Bowler et al. ( 2021 ), will provide a definitive nswer to the number densities of UV-faint AGN and UV-luminous tar-forming galaxies at this time.\n(iv) Examining the time evolution of the AGN fraction versus UV , we find that using the DPL parametrization to model the alaxy population produces a non-evolving AGN fraction, with AGN ominating number counts at luminosities brighter than M UV < 23.1. On the other hand, using the Schechter parametrization to odel the galaxies provides a much sharper evolution, with AGN omination extending as faint as M UV = \u221222.6 at z = 3. (v) The number density of UV-faint AGN is found to evolve much ore rapidly at earlier times and grows by around two orders of agnitude in the range 3 < z < 6. This indicates a rapid onset of AGN ctivity as the Universe enters its current, reionized state. Current ata quality is presently unable to discern significant luminosity ependence in the rise in number counts of UV-faint AGN between = 5 and z = 3, though modelling of the wider LF shows the faintnd slope of the AGN LF flattens with time. Extending our measured volution of the AGN LF to z \u223c 7, we find the predicted number ensities of UV-faint AGN to be too few to account for the excess in alaxies identified in Bowler et al. ( 2014 , 2020 ).\n(vi) Following an optimistic calculation for the AGN contributions owards reionizing photons, we obtain values for \u03c1912 that are lower han found by Giallongo et al. ( 2015 ) and the model derived in\nadau & Haardt ( 2015 ), indicating that AGN contributions are ot high enough to be a dominant contributor towards maintaining ydrogen reionization. Although, with our measured emissivities, e find that AGN contributions are high enough to not be discounted ntirely. This is especially the case if galaxies are better described ith a Schechter function as opposed to a DPL functional form due to he higher numbers of AGN that are required to match the observed umber density of sources at M UV \u223c \u221223. The rapid evolution of he AGN LF mak es it increasingly unlik ely that AGN contribute ignificantly to the initial reionization of hydrogen at z > 7.\nUp until now, studies that probe the very faint end of the UV LF M UV > \u221220) at high redshifts have primarily been focused on using he Hubble Space Telescope , which has a relatively small field of iew and near-infrared co v erage limited to 1.8 microns. This has estricted the wavelength ranges available to apply more detailed ED modelling and redshift estimation as used in this work. With he increase in depths, wavelength coverage and volume probed by pcoming facilities such as the JWST and the upcoming Euclid Space elescope, the application of SED fitting techniques will be able to e extended to even higher redshifts and larger dynamical ranges f intrinsic luminosity. The resulting impro v ement in both comleteness and contamination rates that photometric redshifts/SED odelling provide over colour\u2013colour selection (e.g. Burg et al. 010 ; Oesch et al. 2013 ) will soon enable for greater constraints o be placed on the total UV LF across most of the observable niverse.\nA\nT t t d t\nF f t S R F k a E H g T o\nE p p b\nj T c t a p D S\nn T t f t O a F C a S T P\nT i N p A\nD\nA d w\nc h s p\nR\nA\nA A A A A A\nB B\nB B\nB B B B B B B B B B B B B\nB\nB\nv C\nC\nC C C C C C\nC C\nD\nD D E F F F\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/523/1/327/7153338 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\nhe authors would like to pass on our thanks to J.Patterson and he University of Oxford\u2019s IT team at the Physics Department for heir continued efforts.

( 2021 ) data set at the very faint nd of the galaxy UV LF. In addition, it is in this redshift bin where the ouwens et al. ( 2021 ) observations differ the most from other studies hat have probed the faint end in the range 3 < z < 5 (e.g. Finkelstein t al. 2015 ; Parsa et al. 2016 ). To assess the potential impact of this n our conclusions regarding the DPL-based evolutionary model iscussed in Section 5.4 , we repeat the fitting procedure with the use f the Finkelstein et al. ( 2015 ) data points instead of Bouwens et al. 2021 ). We present the results of this in Table B1 and highlight it s the red data point in Fig. 12 . High \u03c72 values remain around the egion where we transition from using our observations to that of inkelstein et al. ( 2015 ), leading to no impro v ement in the final \u03c72 red . possible solution would be to consistently analyse both groundased and space-based data with the same selection procedures and ethodologies. We observe that the change in the best-fitting parameters is ocused on the faint end slope ( \u03b1) of the galaxy UV LF. We nd that the LF normalization \u2217 increases by around 0.1\u20130.2 ex and the characteristic magnitude gets fainter by 0.19 mag ompared to when Bouwens et al. ( 2021 ) data are used for both he Schechter and DPL parametrizations. In both cases, these shifts re driven by degeneracies of these parameters with the faint-end lope, which shifts by \u03b4\u03b1 > 0.25. This result also provides a more moothly evolving DPL faint-end slope compared to when Bouwens t al. ( 2021 ) data are used at z = 4. Otherwise, the results still gree with our observations that the evolution in the parameters sed to describe the UV LF experience a turn o v er around 3 < < 4, indicating a shift in the physical processes go v erning the volution of the UV LF, such as the onset of wide scale galaxy uenching.\nMNRAS 523, 327\u2013346 (2023)\nMNRAS 523, 327\u2013346 (2023)\nTable B1. The results of the MCMC fitting applied to the total UV LF at z = 4. The fit uses data points from Finkelstein et al. ( 2015 ) fainter than probed by our measurement. It also includes those from Akiyama et al. ( 2018 ) to provide better sampling of the AGN UV LF. The first column lists the fitting parametrization used. Columns 2\u20135 are the best-fitting DPL parameters for the AGN LF. Columns 6\u20139 show the best-fitting LBG parameters, either for a Schechter function or DPL. The final columns show the \u03c72 and reduced \u03c72 of the fit.\nFunction log 10 ( AGN ) M \u2217AGN \u03b1AGN \u03b2AGN log 10 ( ) M \u2217 \u03b1 \u03b2 \u03c72 \u03c72 red\nmag \u22121 Mpc \u22123 mag mag \u22121 Mpc \u22123 mag\nz = 4.0 DPL + Sch \u22127 . 96 + 0 . 13 \u22120 . 10 \u221227 . 41 + 0 . 16 \u22120 . 12 \u22122 . 14 + 0 . 05 \u22120 . 04 \u22124 . 83 + 0 . 45 \u22120 . 55 \u22122 . 87 + 0 . 02 \u22120 . 03 \u221220 . 92 + 0 . 03 \u22120 . 03 \u22121 . 49 + 0 . 03 \u22120 . 03 \u2013 78 .11 2.17 DPL + DPL \u22127 . 67 + 0 . 23 \u22120 . 18 \u221227 . 05 + 0 . 39 \u22120 . 24 \u22121 . 95 + 0 . 13 \u22120 . 09 \u22124 . 13 + 0 . 42 \u22120 . 49 \u22123 . 43 + 0 . 04 \u22120 . 04 \u221221 . 49 + 0 . 05 \u22120 . 05 \u22121 . 85 + 0 . 03 \u22120 . 03 \u22124 . 93 + 0 . 11 \u22120 . 12 111 .05 3.17\nThis paper has been typeset from a T E X/L A T E X file prepared by the author.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
