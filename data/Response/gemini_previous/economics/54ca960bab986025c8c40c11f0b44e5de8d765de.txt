1. **Investigate the impact of different information disclosure strategies on the overall efficiency of the sharing system.** This could be done by considering a more comprehensive model that takes into account the impact of information disclosure on the number of transactions, the quality of the transactions, and the overall welfare of the buyers and sellers.


2. **Explore the role of reputation in sellers' information disclosure decisions.** In the current model, sellers' information disclosure decisions are based solely on their own costs and benefits. However, in reality, sellers may also be concerned about their reputation, which could influence their willingness to disclose information.


3. **Examine the impact of different market structures on sellers' information disclosure strategies.** The current model assumes a duopoly market structure, but in reality, sharing systems may have a variety of different market structures, such as monopoly, oligopoly, or perfect competition. It would be interesting to investigate how the market structure affects sellers' information disclosure strategies and the overall efficiency of the sharing system.


4. **Develop a dynamic model of information disclosure in sharing systems.** The current model is static, meaning that it assumes that sellers' information disclosure strategies are fixed over time. However, in reality, sellers may update their information disclosure strategies over time based on their experience and the actions of other sellers. It would be interesting to develop a dynamic model that captures this learning process.


5. **Investigate the impact of information disclosure on the pricing strategies of sellers in sharing systems.** The current model assumes that sellers set their prices independently of each other. However, in reality, sellers may compete with each other on price, and this competition may be affected by the information that sellers disclose about their commodities. It would be interesting to investigate how information disclosure affects sellers' pricing strategies and the overall efficiency of the sharing system.
