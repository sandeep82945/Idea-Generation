The prevalence of COPD and asthma, along with the participants demographical and spirometry data were examined.\nResults The average age of participants was 57 \u00b1 8 years. Never smokers had a significant higher BMI (26.6 vs. 24.8), FEV1 (91% vs. 82%) and FVC (96% vs. 88%) values compared to participants with a positive smoking status. There was a statistical difference in the prevalence of COPD, asthma, and asthma COPD overlap (ACO) based on the participants smoking status, with the highest prevalence among opium and cigarette smokers, followed by opium users alone. Based on multivariate analysis, higher age, lower BMI, lower education than under diploma, cigarette smoking and opium use were significantly correlated with higher COPD prevalence; while lower age, cigarette smoking and opium use were significantly correlated with higher asthma prevalence. Illiterate participants had a significantly higher prevalence of COPD (23.6%), asthma (22%), and ACO (7.9%) among the educational groups. Regarding the prevalence of asthma, the higher socio-economic group had the lowest prevalence.\nConclusions Opium and tobacco users had a significantly higher prevalence of respiratory diseases, along with lower lung function tests based on spirometry evaluation.\nKeywords Cohort, COPD, Asthma, Prevalence, Iran"

            "text": "Cigarette smoking has been shown to worsen the lung function [1], increase exacerbation rates, [2, 3] and increase respiratory symptoms [4, 5] in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma [6]. Furthermore, when compared to the risk associated with smoking in other health conditions, smoking confers a relative risk of mortality that is two times higher in COPD [7]. Despite the significant negative health effects of smoking in COPD and asthma, precise estimates of smoking prevalence in COPD and asthma compared to the general smoking population, as well as analyses of key variables that may underpin this (such as sociodemographic characteristics, smoking behaviors, and use of physician counseling and smoking cessation pharmacotherapy), are lacking. Understanding the scope and nature of smoking behaviors and cessation strategies in COPD and asthma may help healthcare providers and policymakers\u2019 better target resources and develop more effective approaches to assist smokers in these high-risk disease groups in successfully quitting. Despite the fact that smoking-related lung diseases such as COPD and asthma are on the rise, the effects of demographical factors on smoking behavior and cessation among those with respiratory diseases are poorly understood [8\u201311].\nSubstance abuse is defined as the harmful use of any substance that has not been approved by medical authorities and are being used for recreational purposes worldwide [12]. Among the members of substance abuse families is opium, which is commonly used to relieve pain in middle-aged people. It\u2019s a substance derived from the poppy plant. Its history can be traced all the way back to antiquity. Opium was used in traditional medicine in Iran, where it was known as Afion or Taryak [13]. Opium can be consumed as an inhalant or as a comestible. Opioid users have been reported to have small airway diseases. In 1976, the first study of the link between opium and COPD was published in Tehran, Iran [14]. Lung diseases with an obstructive pattern can be clinically demonstrated in opium smokers [15]. Chronic bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiolitis, and COPD can all be caused by opium use [14, 15]. The impact of opium on the respiratory system has not been thoroughly studied; however, according to evidence, opium inhalation can be classified as a risk factor in COPD epidemiology [15].\nAsthma and COPD [15] have similarities in that both can present with fixed airway obstruction (6). Asthma, on the other hand, has been identified as a risk factor for the development of COPD [16]. Bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR) is a defining feature of asthma, and it can be found in 54% of COPD patients [17]. Asthma and COPD patients should avoid opiates due to the increased mortality rate [18].\nThe majority of respiratory guidelines agree that spirometry should be used to diagnose COPD [19]. Patients with respiratory complaints in most countries, on the other hand, go to their primary care provider first, rather than a pulmonary specialist [20, 21], because access to spirometry is limited by cost, availability of spirometry equipment, availability of appropriately trained personnel, or simply the time required for the test. Based on available data, spirometry appears to be underutilized in primary care [22, 23].\nThe goal of this study is to compare the prevalence of asthma and COPD among opium, and cigarette smokers with COPD or asthma to the general population, and to see if smoking habits, physician counseling about quitting smoking, and smoking cessation medication use differed between smokers with COPD or asthma and the general smoking population. We also aim to evaluate the prevalence of COPD and related risk factors."

Kharameh is one of the counties of Fars province, the fifth populous province located in southwestern Iran. According to the latest national census in 2016, its population was 54,864 [26]. Out of the participants in the Kharameh cohort aged 45 to 75 years old, 5944 were female and 4719 were male. The inclusion criteria were living in Kharameh for at least 1 year before the start of this study, and willingness to participate. The participants were categorized into three groups of opium user, cigarette smokers, and a combination of both. Because of very low prevalence of opium among women, they were excluded in this study.\nUsing statulator, online sample size calculator, With confidence of 95% and absolute precision of 5%, based on previous study on the prevalence of COPD and asthma in patients with opioid dependency [27], the sample size of our study was estimated to be 350 [28]. Patients in each group were selected by systematic random sampling method, and were matched based on their age."

Features in favor of COPD include productive cough, progressive increase in severity of accompanying symptoms. For spirometry evaluation, for asthma we included variable airflow limitation, along with the increase of FEV1 of more than 12% and more then 200mL from baseline after 2 puffs (each puff 100\u00a0 \u00b5g) of salbutamol spray as bronchodilator (BD). For COPD, persistent airflow limitation along with post BD FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 0.7 was considered. For ACOS, FEV1 higher than 12% and above 300mL from the baseline after BD, but FEV1 to FVC ratio of under 0.7 after BD. Also, a normal FEV1 to FVC ratio before and after BD is in favor of asthma and contrary to COPD and ACOS [31]."

Furthermore, investigating COPD prevalence among opioid agonist treatment patients is an important first step in ensuring and improving timely medical treatment offers for the opioid agonist treatment cohort and avoiding costs (e.g. fewer hospitalizations due to exacerbations).\nBased on spirometry evolution, never smokers had a significantly higher FEV1 and FVC values compared to"

Aldington et al. also found that patients who used both tobacco and cannabis had lower FEV1, despite the fact that cannabis usage alone had no effect on FEV1 (when compared to never smokers) [43]. Little cannabis usage has no impact on pulmonary function, according to a study by Pletcher et al. [43].\nThere was no statistically significant difference among the SES group regarding the usage of opium and cigarettes. Although our findings demonstrated a higher prevalence of pulmonary diseases among opium and cigarette users, the high rate of tobacco use among drug users cannot entirely account for the link between opium use and chronic respiratory disease. This implies that there might be more intricate elements relating to opium abuse that require more investigation. The connections may result from societal factors, the route of drug abuse, or the pharmacological effects of illicit drugs on the airways. Medical personnel that interact with drug users should be well knowledgeable about diagnosing and ruling out chronic respiratory diseases. More research is required to determine whether the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory illness in opium users are adequate. This may enable the detection of the proportion of opium users who also have undetected respiratory conditions, which may then be used to assess the effectiveness of existing therapy and bring about a change in policy."
