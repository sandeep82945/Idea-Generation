1. **Investigate the impact of different pretraining objectives on BanglaT5's performance.** The paper uses a "span-correction" objective for pretraining BanglaT5, but other objectives, such as text-infilling or masked language modeling, could also be explored. It would be interesting to see how these different objectives affect BanglaT5's performance on various NLG tasks.


2. **Explore the use of BanglaT5 for other NLG tasks.** The paper evaluates BanglaT5 on six NLG tasks, but there are many other NLG tasks that could be explored. For example, BanglaT5 could be used for abstractive summarization, dialogue generation, or question answering.


3. **Develop new evaluation metrics for Bangla NLG.** The paper uses standard evaluation metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE, but these metrics may not be ideal for evaluating all types of NLG tasks. New evaluation metrics that are more specific to Bangla NLG could be developed.


4. **Create a larger and more diverse dataset for Bangla NLG.** The BanglaNLG benchmark dataset is a valuable resource for Bangla NLG research, but it is relatively small and does not cover all types of NLG tasks. A larger and more diverse dataset could be created to support the development of more robust and generalizable Bangla NLG models.


5. **Investigate the use of BanglaT5 for real-world NLG applications.** BanglaT5 could be used to develop NLG applications such as chatbots, text summarizers, and machine translation systems. It would be interesting to see how BanglaT5 performs in these real-world applications and how it can be adapted to meet the specific needs of these applications.
