1. **Investigate the structural basis for the lack of specificity of gatastatin and its derivatives for γ tubulin.** This could be done by conducting additional molecular docking and dynamics simulations, as well as mutagenesis studies, to identify the key residues and interactions that contribute to the binding of these compounds to both α-β and γ tubulin.


2. **Design and synthesize new gatastatin derivatives with improved specificity for γ tubulin.** This could be done by modifying the structure of gatastatin to increase its affinity for γ tubulin while decreasing its affinity for α-β tubulin. This could be achieved by introducing new functional groups or modifying the existing ones, or by changing the overall shape of the molecule.


3. **Evaluate the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of new gatastatin derivatives against glioblastoma multiforme and other cancers.** This could be done by conducting cell-based assays to measure the cytotoxicity of the compounds, as well as animal studies to assess their antitumor activity.


4. **Investigate the potential off-target effects of gatastatin and its derivatives.** This could be done by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the binding of these compounds to other proteins in the cell, as well as by assessing their toxicity in animal models.


5. **Explore the potential use of gatastatin and its derivatives in combination with other anticancer agents.** This could be done by conducting studies to determine whether these compounds can synergize with other drugs to improve their efficacy and reduce their side effects.
