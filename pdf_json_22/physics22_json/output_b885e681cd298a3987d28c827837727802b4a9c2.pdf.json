    "abstractText": "The tree-level q-map assigns to a projective special real (PSR) manifold of dimension n \u2212 1 \u2265 0, a quaternionic K\u00e4hler (QK) manifold of dimension 4n + 4. It is known that the resulting QK manifold admits a (3n + 5)-dimensional universal group of isometries (i.e. independently of the choice of PSR manifold). On the other hand, in the context of Calabi\u2013Yau compactifications of type IIB string theory, the classical hypermultiplet moduli space metric is an instance of a tree-level q-map space, and it is known from the physics literature that such a metric has an SL(2, R) group of isometries related to the SL(2, Z) S-duality symmetry of the full 10d theory. We present a purely mathematical proof that any tree-level q-map space admits such an SL(2, R) action by isometries, enlarging the previous universal group of isometries to a (3n+6)-dimensional group G. As part of this analysis, we describe how the (3n + 5)-dimensional subgroup interacts with the SL(2, R)-action, and find a codimension one normal subgroup of G that is unimodular. By taking a quotient with respect to a lattice in the unimodular group, we obtain a quaternionic K\u00e4hler manifold fibering over a projective special real manifold with fibers of finite volume, and compute the volume as a function of the base. We furthermore provide a mathematical treatment of results from the physics literature concerning the twistor space of the tree-level q-map space and the holomorphic lift of the (3n + 6)-dimensional group of universal isometries to the twistor space.",

            "text": "In the context of type IIB string theory, S-duality is an SL(2, Z)-symmetry of the full 10d-theory that relates strong coupling effects with weak coupling effects. When compactifying the 10d-theory on a Calabi\u2013Yau 3-fold X , one obtains a 4d effective theory with amoduli spaceMIIB4d (X). Furthermore,MIIB4d (X) is supposed to inherit an S-duality action by isometrieswhen all or certain quantum corrections are included [AP12, Section 2.2]. The moduli space MIIB4d (X) has the structure\nMIIB4d (X) =MIIBVM(X)\u00d7MIIBHM(X) , (1.1) where MIIBVM(X) is known as the vector multiplet moduli space, and MIIBHM(X) as the hypermultiplet moduli space.MIIBVM(X) has the structure of a projective special K\u00e4hler (PSK) manifold, whileMIIBHM(X) has the structure of a quaternionic K\u00e4hler (QK) manifold. S-duality then descends to an action onMIIB4d (X), acting trivially onMIIBVM(X) and non-trivially onMIIBHM(X), so we focus on the later.When one considers the classical geometry ofMIIBHM(X) (i.e. the geometry obtained by dropping all quantum corrections in the string coupling constant gs , and also taking the large volume limit), it has been shown in the physics literature that S-duality acts by isometries [BGHL00], and can be even enhanced to an action of SL(2, R) by isometries. An argument using the twistor space associated toMIIBHM(X) can be found in [APSV09,AP12], while a direct argument can be found for example in [ABL18, Section 2.2]. Furthermore, a discussion of the isometries of q-map spaces from the supergravity literature is given in [dWVVP93,dWP96]. Our intention, however, is to do a purely differential geometric treatment, avoiding arguments\nfrom supergravity or string theory, and hence making it accessible to the mathematician with training in differential geometry.\nOur first objective in this paper is to do a purely mathematical treatment of the Sduality action by isometries on any tree-level q-map space. More precisely, we give a proof that any tree-level q-map metric admits an SL(2, R)-action by isometries, and show how it interacts with the previously known universal group of isometries from the mathematics literature [CDJL20, Appendix A]. When the tree-level q-map metric is realized by the classical geometry of MIIBHM(X) in string theory, the SL(2, R)-action corresponds to the action induced by S-duality. Our proof that the SL(2, R)-action acts by isometries is done by showing that the infinitesimal action is given by Killing fields; together with the simplifying Lemma 3.14, which allows us to reduce the problem to showing that theKillingfieldproperty holds along a certain lowdimensional submanifold of the tree-level q-map space. The original argument of [BGHL00] relies on analysing the 4d low energy effective actions of type IIA and IIB string theory, which we want to avoid in our purely differential geometric argument. On the other hand, the direct argument of [ABL18, Section 2.2] relies on two facts, namely that the S-duality action on the classicalMIIBHM(X) is isometric, and that the pull-back of the classical IIB metric by the mirror map coincides with the classical type IIA metric (which has the usual treelevel q-map metric form reviewed in Sect. 2). The calculation establishing the latter fact is however omitted, which is why we chose to present our alternative explicit arguments.\nA q-map space is obtained by composing two constructions. First we start with a projective special real (PSR) manifold (H, gH) and construct a projective special K\u00e4hler (PSK) manifold (M, gM ) via the supergravity r-map, see [CHM12,CDJL20] and references therein. On the other hand, the (one-loop corrected) supergravity c-map takes a PSK manifold (M, gM ) and produces a 1-parameter family (Nc, g c FS) of QK metrics [RLSV06,ACDM15], known as the 1-loop corrected Ferrara-Sabharval metric. The composition of the two previous constructions produces what is known as a (oneloop corrected) q-map space. In the following we take the 1-loop parameter c = 0, and hence focus only on (N , gN ) := (N 0, g0FS) obtained from PSR manifolds (H, gH) via the q-map. The case c = 0 is the so-called tree-level case, and hence (N , gN ) is refered to as a tree-level q-map metric. Our plan for the first part of the paper will then consist of the following:\n\u2022 In Sect. 2 we review the universal isometries for tree-level q-map spaces that are known in the mathematics literature [CDJL20, Appendix A]. If dim(H) = n \u2212 1 \u2265 0, then the tree-level q-map space (N , gN ) has dim(N ) = 4n + 4. Any such (N , gN ) has a group acting by isometries of the form L2 := Iwa(SU(1, n + 2)), where Iwa(SU(1, n + 2)) denotes the solvable Iwasawa subgroup of SU(1, n + 2). Furthermore, (N , gN ) has a group acting by isometries of the from L := L1 \u03d5h L2. Here L1 = R>0 Rn comes from isometries of the PSKmanifold in the image of the r-map, and \u03d5h : L1 \u2192 Aut(L2) is a certain homomorphism depending on the cubic polynomial h(t) defining the PSR manifold. The group L has dimension 3n + 5. \u2022 In Sect. 3 we define the S-duality SL(2, R)-action on N . To define the action, it will be convenient to perform a diffeomorphism of N that in the string theory setting corresponds to the classical mirror map [BGHL00]. We remark that even though we are not in the string theory setting (and hence there are no compactified theories on mirror Calabi\u2013Yau\u2019s to relate), the formulas defining the classical mirror map still make sense as a diffeomorphism of N . With the help of the 3n + 5-dimensional universal group L of isometries, we show that the S-duality action of SL(2, R) is generated by Killing vectors and is thus isometric.\nMore precisely, let e, f, h be the usual generators of the Lie algebra sl(2, R) satisfying\n[e, f ] = h, [h, e] = 2e, [h, f ] = \u22122 f , (1.2) and let Xe, X f and Xh be the corresponding vector fields on N , representing the infinitesimal S-duality action. Xe turns out to be a Killing vector field of any c-map space. On the other hand, the fact that X f and Xh are Killing really uses the fact that we are a on a tree-level q-map space. For example, it will be easy to see that setting the 1-loop parameter to c = 0 breaks the isometry generated by Xh (and hence the one by X f , by (1.2)). \u2022 The main results of Sect. 3 are the following:\nTheorems 3.16 and 3.17: Let (N , gN ) be a tree-level q-map space associated to the PSR manifold (H, gH) with dim(H) = n \u2212 1 \u2265 0. Then S-duality acts by isometries, and there is a (3n + 6)-dimensional connected Lie-group G of isometries containing the isometries of the L-action and S-duality. The Lie algebra of G is isomorphic to\nR (sl2(R) (R n h)) (1.3)\nwith the brackets described in Sect. 3.3. The lie algebra h denotes a certain real codimension 1 sub-algebra of the Lie algebra heis2n+3(R) of the Heisenberg group. Furthermore, in Corollary 3.20we consider howG is enlarged by the isometries obtained from the automorphisms of the PSR manifold H. The other main result from this section is the following: Theorem 3.21: Consider a tree-level q-map space (N , gN ) associated to a PSRmanifold (H, h) with\nh(ta) = 1 6 kabct atbtc, kabc \u2208 Z . (1.4)\nFurthermore, recall the nilradical n \u2282 g from Corollary 3.12. Then there is a lattice of the normal and unimodular codimension 1 subgroup SL(2, R) exp(n) \u2282 G, acting by isometries on (N , gN ). The quotient gives a fiber bundle N/ \u2192 H with fibers of finite volume. In Sect. 3.5 we compute the fiber-wise volume density of N \u2192 H, and explicitly study the volume growth of the fibers of N/ \u2192 H in the cases where H is a maximal PSR curve. This will allow us to conclude that N/ is of finite volume only when H is the incomplete maximal PSR curve. In the case of a complete PSR curve with arclength parameter s \u2208 (\u2212\u221e,\u221e) we show the following dichotomy holds. Either the sublevel and superlevel sets of s : N/ \u2192 R are both of infinite volume or, only the sublevel sets are (for the appropriate orientation ofH). The latter case occurs precisely when the PSR curve is homogeneous.\nIn the second part of the paper we revisit and do a mathematical treatment of results from the physics literature [NPV07,APSV09,AP12] concerning the twistor space (Z, I, \u03bb, \u03c4 )of (N , gN ) and theholomorphic lifts of the universal isometries to (Z, I, \u03bb, \u03c4 ) (here I denotes the complex structure of Z , \u03bb the holomorphic contact distribution, and \u03c4 the real structure [Sal82]). More specifically, in Sect. 4 we discuss the following:\n\u2022 Any tree-level q-map space (N , gN ) lies in the image of theHK/QKcorrespondence, and hence has an associated (pseudo-)hyperk\u00e4hler (HK)manifold (N , gN , I1, I2, I3), together with a circle bundle P \u2192 N with a hyperholomorphic connection \u03b7. If (N , gN ) is anyQKmanifold in the image of theHK/QKcorrespence,wewill describe\nthe twistor space (Z, I, \u03bb, \u03c4 )of (N , gN ) in termsof the \u201cHK-data\" (N , gN , I1, I2, I3) and (P \u2192 N , \u03b7). This description has the advantage that theHKdata is usually easier to describe and handle than the QK data. On the other hand, since the description works for anyQKspace obtained viaHK/QKcorrespondence, it holds not only for the tree-level q-map case, but also any c-map space, or any c-map space with \u201cmutually local instanton corrections\" [CT22]1. \u2022 We will then restrict the previous twistor description to the case where (N , gN ) is a tree-level c-map space, and discuss certain holomorphic Darboux coordinates for the contact structure \u03bb found in [NPV07]. It is clear that the local contact distribution defined by those coordinates coincides with ker \u03bb, but it is a bit more tricky to show that they are actually holomorphic with respect to the holomorphic structure of Z . This difficulty originates from the fact that \u03bb \u2208 1(Z,L) is valued in a holomorphic line bundle L \u2192 Z , and when discussing holomorphic Darboux coordinates for \u03bb one needs to make sure one is working in a holomorphic trivialization of L\u2192 Z . \u2022 On the other hand, any group action by isometries of a QKmanifold lifts canonically to a holomorphic action on its twistor space, preserving the holomorphic contact distribution and commuting with the real structure [NT87]. If (N , gN ) is a tree-level q-map metric, this means that the (3n +6)-dimensional group of isometries G lifts to the twistor space. This in particular includes the lift of S-duality previously studied in [APSV09,AP12]. We finish Sect. 4 by explicitly discussing the lift of the G-action to the twistor space.\nFinally, in Sect. 5we present a quick outlook onwhat is known in the physics literature regarding the S-duality action on the quantum corrected versions of MIIBHM(X) (see for example [AS09,AP12,AMP13,ABMP16,ABMP18,AP19]), and also state future directions regarding the mathematical treatment of such quantum corrected cases."

            "text": "In this section we review the supergravity r-map, c-map and q-map. At each step we also discuss the universal groups of isometries that are known in the mathematics literature.\n2.1. The r-map. The r-map produces a projective special K\u00e4hler (PSK) manifold (M, gM ) from a projective special real (PSR) manifold (H, gH). We recall the corresponding definitions below. Our main references will be [CHM12,CDJL20].\nDefinition 2.1. A projective special real (PSR) manifold is a Riemannian manifold (H, gH) such that H \u2282 Rn is a hypersurface, and there is a homogeneous cubic polynomial h : Rn \u2192 R satisfying \u2022 H \u2282 {t \u2208 Rn | h(t) = 1}. \u2022 gH = \u2212\u22022h|TH\u00d7TH. We will denote the coordinates of Rn by ta , where a = 1, 2, . . . , n. In particular, we will write h as follows:\nh(ta) = 1 6 kabct atbtc (2.1)\nwhere the coefficients kabc \u2208 R are symmetric in the indices. 1 In the physics literature this is also expected to extend to the case of non-mutually local D-instanton corrections [APP11], but a mathematically rigorous construction of such metrics is not currently understood.\nDefinition 2.2. Aconical affine specialK\u00e4hler (CASK)manifold is a tuple (M, gM , \u03c9M , \u2207, \u03be) such that \u2022 (M, gM , \u03c9M ) is a pseudo-K\u00e4hler manifold. We denote its complex structure by J (i.e. gM (J\u2212,\u2212) = \u03c9M (\u2212,\u2212)). \u2022 \u2207 is a flat, torsion-free connection on M satisfying \u2207\u03c9M = 0 and d\u2207 J = 0, where d\u2207 : nM (T M)\u2192 n+1M (T M) is the natural extension of \u2207, and we think of J as an element of 1M (T M).\u2022 \u2207\u03be = D\u03be = Id, where D is the Levi-Civita connection and Id is the identity map on T M . \u2022 gM is negative definite on D = Span{\u03be, J\u03be} and positive definite on D\u22a5. Assume that \u03be generates a free R>0-action on M and that J\u03be generates a free S1action on M . Then \u03bc = 12gM (\u03be, \u03be) gives a moment map for the S1-action, and by performing the K\u00e4hler quotient M := \u03bc\u22121(\u22121/2)/S1 (recall that gM (\u03be, \u03be) < 0), we obtain a K\u00e4hler manifold (M, gM ).\nDefinition 2.3. The K\u00e4hler manifold (M, gM ) obtained via the previous K\u00e4hler quotient is called a projective special K\u00e4hler (PSK) manifold.\nAn easy way to obtain PSK manifolds is via the notion of CASK domains [ACD02, CDS17]:\nDefinition 2.4. A CASK domain is a tuple (M,F) such that\n\u2022 M \u2282 Cn+1\\{0} is a C\u00d7-invariant domain (with respect to the usual C\u00d7-action on C n+1\\{0} by multiplication). \u2022 F : M \u2192 C is a holomorphic function, homogeneous of degree 2 with respect to the C\u00d7-action. \u2022 With respect to the natural holomorphic coordinates (X0, . . . , Xn) ofM , the matrix\n\u03c4i j := ( \u22022F \u2202Xi\u2202X j ) (2.2)\nsatisfies that Im(\u03c4i j ) has signature (n, 1) and Im(\u03c4i j )Xi X j < 0 for X \u2208 M .\nFrom this data, one obtains a CASK manifold (M, gM , \u03c9M ,\u2207, \u03be) by\ngM = Im(\u03c4i j )dXidX j , \u03c9M = i 2 Im(\u03c4i j )dX i \u2227 dX j , \u03be = Xi\u2202Xi + Xi\u2202Xi .(2.3)\nThe flat connection \u2207 is defined such that dxi := Re(dXi ) and dyi := \u2212Re (\n\u2202F \u2202Xi\n) is a\nflat frame of T \u2217M . In the case of a CASK domain, \u03be and J\u03be generate a free C\u00d7-action on M , so we can perform the K\u00e4hler quotient from before and obtain a PSK manifold (M, gM ). Now consider a PSR manifold (H, gH) defined by the real cubic homogeneous polynomial h, and let U = R>0 \u00b7H \u2282 Rn\\{0}. We define M := Rn + iU \u2282 Cn with the canonical holomorphic structure, where global holomorphic coordinates are given by za := ba + i ta \u2208 Rn + iU . On M we consider the metric\ngM = \u22022K\n\u2202za\u2202zb dzadzb (2.4)\nwhere\nK := \u2212 log K (t), K (t) := 8h(t) = 4 3 kabct atbtc, t = (ta) = (t1, . . . , tn). (2.5)\nThen it can be shown that (M, gM ) is a PSK manifold [CHM12]. Its corresponding CASK manifold is defined via the CASK domain (M,F), where M \u2282 Cn+1 is given by\nM := {(X0, . . . , Xn) = X0 \u00b7 (1, z) \u2208 Cn+1 | X0 \u2208 C\u00d7, z \u2208 M} (2.6) and\nF(X) = \u2212h(X 1, . . . , Xn) X0 = \u22121 6 kabc Xa XbXc X0 , X = (Xi ) = (X0, . . . , Xn).\n(2.7)\nRemark 2.5. In the following, the indices labeled by i , j , k, . . . range from 0 to n, while those labeled by a, b, c . . . range from 1 to n.\nThe relation between the coordinates Xi on M and the coordinates za of M is given by\nXi X0 = zi , z0 := 1 . (2.8)\nDefinition 2.6. The construction described above, which associates the PSK manifold (M, gM ) with the PSR manifold (H, gH), is called the r-map. The corresponding inclusion map (H, gH) \u2192 (M, gM ) is also called the r-map. A similar double use of terminology applies to the c-map and q-map discussed below.\n2.2. The universal group L1 = R>0 Rn of isometries of r-map spaces. From (2.4) and (2.5), one finds the following explicit expression for a PSK metric in the image of the r-map\ngM = \u2212 1\n4\n\u22022 log h(t)\n\u2202ta\u2202tb (dbadbb + dtadtb)\n= ( \u2212 kabct c\n4h(t) + kacdkbe f tctd tet f (4h(t))2\n) (dbadbb + dtadtb) , (2.9)\nwhere we recall that za = ba + i ta . If dimR(H) = n \u2212 1, it then follows that gM has a groupRn of isometries acting by translations in the ba coordinates. Furthermore, there is a group R>0 of isometries acting by scalings za \u2192 \u03bbza . Combining the two, we obtain the group L1 := R>0 Rn of isometries. This group is independent of the original PSR manifold.\nWe remark that the mapR>0\u00d7H\u2192 U given by (r, pa)\u2192 rpa is a diffeomorphism, allowing us to identify M = Rn + iU \u223c= H\u00d7 L1. With respect to this identification we can rewrite (2.9) as\ngM = 1\n4 gH +\n3\n4\ndr2\nr2 +\n1\nr2\n( \u2212 kabc p c\n4 + kacdkbe f pc pd pe p f 42\n) dbadbb, p \u2208 H\n= 1 4 gH + gL1(p)\n(2.10)\nwhere gL1(p) is a family of left-invariant metrics on L1 parametrized by p \u2208 H.\n2.3. The c-map. The supergravity c-map assigns a 1-parameter family of QKmetrics to a PSK manifold [RLSV06,ACDM15]. We describe the supergravity c-map in the case that the PSK manifold (M, gM ) comes from a CASK domain (M,F), since this will be the case of interest to us.\nLet N = M\u00d7R>0\u00d7R2n+3, where n = dimC(M).We consider global coordinates on N given by (za, \u03c1, \u03b6\u0303i , \u03b6 i , \u03c3 ) \u2208 M\u00d7R>0\u00d7R2n+2\u00d7R, where i = 0, . . . , n. Furthermore, given c \u2208 R we denote Nc := {\u03c1 > \u22122c} \u2282 N , and define the metric gcFS on Nc by\ngcFS := \u03c1 + c\n\u03c1 gM +\n\u03c1 + 2c 4\u03c12(\u03c1 + c) d\u03c12 \u2212 1 4\u03c1\n( Ni j \u2212 2(\u03c1 + c)\n\u03c1K zi z j\n) WiW j\n+ \u03c1 + c\n64\u03c12(\u03c1 + 2c) (d\u03c3 + \u03b6\u0303i d\u03b6\ni \u2212 \u03b6 i d \u03b6\u0303i \u2212 4cdcK)2 , (2.11)\nwhere Ni j := \u22122Im(\u03c4i j ); Ni j is the inverse matrix;Wi := d \u03b6\u0303i \u2212 \u03c4i j d\u03b6 j ; K = Ni j zi z j ; K = \u2212 log(K ); and dc = i(\u2202\u2212\u2202). It is shown in [ACDM15, Theorem 5] that the metric (Nc, gcFS) is QK and positive definite.\nRemark 2.7. We are using a slightly different convention from [ACDM15] in the normalization of the variables. Our conventions are such that the scalings \u03c3 \u2192 \u22124\u03c3 , \u03b6\u0303i \u2192 2\u0303\u03b6i , \u03b6 i \u2192 2\u03b6 i takes the expression (2.11) to the one in [ACDM15, Equation 4.11] (one also needs [ACDM15, Equation 4.12] for a direct comparison). Notice that there is a difference in the sign of \u03c4i j (and hence Ni j and K ), due to the opposite convention in the signature of the starting CASK domain, with respect to [ACDM15].\nIn the following,we set c = 0, and focus on the simplified tree-levelmetric (N , gN ) := (N 0, g0FS). In this case (2.11) reduces to\ngN = gM + d\u03c12 4\u03c12 \u2212 1 4\u03c1 (Ni j \u2212 2 K zi z j )WiW j + 1 64\u03c12 (d\u03c3 + \u03b6\u0303i d\u03b6\ni \u2212 \u03b6 i d \u03b6\u0303i )2 . (2.12)\nDefinition 2.8. Let (M,F) be a CASK domain and (M, gM ) its PSK manifold. Given c \u2208 R, the map (M, gM )\u2192 (Nc, gcFS) described above is called the (1-loop corrected) supergravity c-map. If we set c = 0, we call the map (M, gM )\u2192 (N , gN ) the tree-level supergravity c-map.\n2.4. The universal group L2 = Iwa(SU (1, n + 2)) of isometries of tree-level c-map spaces. Consider a c-map space (N , gcFS) with dimR(N ) = 4n + 4. Furthermore, let L2 := Iwa(SU (1, n +2)) be the solvable Iwasawa subgroup of SU (1, n +2). The group L2 is diffeomorphic to R>0 \u00d7 R2n+3 with the group structure given by [CHM12]: (r, \u03b7\u0303i , \u03b7 i , \u03ba) \u00b7 (\u03c1, \u03b6\u0303i , \u03b6 i , \u03c3 ) = (r\u03c1, \u03b7\u0303i + \u221a r \u03b6\u0303i , \u03b7 i + \u221a r\u03b6 i , \u03ba + r\u03c3 + \u221a r(\u03b7i \u03b6\u0303i \u2212 \u03b7\u0303i\u03b6 i )) .\n(2.13)\nFurthermore, L2 contains the Heisenberg group Heis2n+3(R) \u223c= {1} \u00d7 R2n+3 \u2282 L2 as its nilradical.\nLetting L2 act on (za, \u03c1, \u03b6\u0303i , \u03b6 i , \u03c3 ) \u2208 N by acting trivially on za \u2208 M , it is easy to check that it acts by isometries on any tree level c-map metric gN = g0FS; while Heis2n+3(R) \u2282 L2 acts by isometries on any c-map metric gcFS.\nWe denote the generators of the infinitesimal action of L2 on N by\nD = \u03c1\u2202\u03c1 + 1 2 \u03b6\u0303i \u2202\u0303\u03b6i + 1 2 \u03b6 i\u2202\u03b6 i + \u03c3\u2202\u03c3 , Pi = \u2202\u03b6 i + \u03b6\u0303i\u2202\u03c3 , Xi = \u2202\u0303\u03b6i \u2212 \u03b6 i\u2202\u03c3 , Z = \u2202\u03c3 .\n(2.14)\nIn particular, Pi , Xi and Z correspond to the infinitesimal action of Heis2n+3(R). The non-trivial commutation relations among D, Pi , Xi and Z are given by:\n[Pi , X j ] = \u22122\u03b4 ji Z , [Xi , D] = Xi 2 , [Pi , D] = Pi 2 , [Z , D] = Z . (2.15)\nAs in the r-map case, we have N = M \u00d7 L2, and we see from (2.12) that we can write\ngN = gM + gL2(z), (2.16)\nwhere gL2(z) is a family of left-invariant metrics on L2, parametrized by z \u2208 M .\n2.5. The q-map.\nDefinition 2.9. The q-map is the composition of the r-map and the supergravity c-map. That is, the composition of (H, gH)\u2192 (M, gM )\u2192 (Nc, gcFS) for some c \u2208 R. If the take c = 0, we call the corresponding space (N 0, g0FS) a tree-level q-map space.\nWe describe the special structure that some terms of gcFS acquire when g c FS is in the image of the q-map. Besides the specific form of the PSKmetric term gM given in (2.9), we have that the matrices \u03c4i j and Ni j have the special form\n(\u03c4i j ) = (\u2212 13kabczazbzc 12kabczbzc\n1 2kabcz bzc \u2212kabczc )\n(2.17)\nand\n(Ni j ) = (\u22124h(t) + 2kabcbabbtc \u22122kabcbbtc \u22122kabcbbtc 2kabctc ) , (2.18)\nwhere in the above expressions, we have used our previous conventions on the indices i, j and a, b, c. In particular, the first entries are the i = j = 0 components, the offdiagonal elements are the i = 0, j = a or i = a, j = 0 components, and the lower block on the diagonal consists of the i = a, j = b components. The identities (2.17) and (2.18) follow from the specific form of the holomorphic prepotential F given in (2.7), together with the formula Ni j = \u22122Im(\u03c4i j ).\nThe inverse Ni j can be easily computed, and it is given by\n(Ni j ) = \u2212 1 4h(t)\n( 1 ba ba babb \u2212 (G\u22121)ab ) , Gab = 1 2h(t) kabct c . (2.19)\nThe invertibility of Gab follows from the fact that \u2212\u22022h defines a Lorentzian metric on U = R>0 \u00b7H, together with the fact that h(t) > 0 on U .\nThe special structure of the terms (2.17), (2.18), (2.19), will be crucial for the results that we wish to prove.\n2.6. The universal group L = L1 \u03d5h L2 of isometries of tree-level q-map metrics. Let (N , gN ) be a tree-level q-map space of dimension 4n + 4 (i.e. corresponding to a PSR manifold H with dimR(H) = n \u2212 1 \u2265 0).\nBecause (N , gN ) is in particular a tree-level c-map space, it has the group L2 = Iwa(SU (1, n + 2)) acting by isometries. Now let \u03d5h : L1 \u2192 Sp(R2n+2) \u2282 Aut(Iwa (SU (1, n + 2))) be the homomorphism defined as follows:\n\u2022 For \u03bb \u2208 R>0 \u2282 L1, we let \u03d5h(\u03bb) \u00b7 (\u03c1, \u03b6 0, \u03b6 a, \u03b6\u03030, \u03b6\u0303a, \u03c3 ) = (\u03c1, \u03bb\u22123/2\u03b6 0, \u03bb\u22121/2\u03b6 a , \u03bb3/2\u03b6\u03030, \u03bb\n1/2\u03b6\u0303a, \u03c3 ). \u2022 For v \u2208 Rn , we have\n\u03d5h(v) \u00b7 \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d \u03c1 \u03b6 0 \u03b6 a\n\u03b6\u03030 \u03b6\u0303a \u03c3\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0 = \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u03c1 \u03b6 0\n\u03b6 a + \u03b6 0va\n\u03b6\u03030 + 16kabcv avbvc\u03b6 0 + 12kabcv avb\u03b6 c \u2212 \u03b6\u0303ava \u03b6\u0303a \u2212 12\u03b6 0kabcvbvc \u2212 kabcvb\u03b6 c\n\u03c3\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n(2.20)\nIn particular, it is easy to check that \u03d5h(v) acts by an Sp(2n + 2) transformation on (\u03b6 i , \u03b6\u0303i ), and that \u03d5h(v + v\u2032) = \u03d5h(v) \u25e6 \u03d5h(v\u2032). We remark that in the formula (2.20) above, the terms with kabc differ in sign with respect to [CDJL20]. This is again due to the opposite conventions in the signature of the CASK manifold, with respect to [CDJL20]. \u2022 For (\u03bb, v) \u2208 L1 one then defines \u03d5h((\u03bb, v)) = \u03d5h((1, v) \u00b7 (\u03bb, 0)) := \u03d5h(v) \u25e6\u03d5h(\u03bb). It is straightforward to check that \u03d5h is a homomorphism. We then obtain the group L = L1 \u03d5h Iwa(SU (1, n + 2)), and it acts by isometries on the tree-level q-map metric (N , gN ), as shown in [CDJL20].\nThe Killing vectors corresponding to the action of the Rn factor in L1 are given by\nVa := \u2202ba + \u03b6 0\u2202\u03b6 a \u2212 \u03b6\u0303a \u2202\u0303\u03b60 \u2212 kabc\u03b6 c\u2202\u0303\u03b6b , (2.21) while the Killing vector corresponding to the R>0 factor of L1 is given by\nD1 = ba\u2202ba + ta\u2202ta \u2212 3 2 \u03b6 0\u2202\u03b6 0 \u2212 1 2 \u03b6 a\u2202\u03b6 a + 1 2 \u03b6\u0303a \u2202\u0303\u03b6a + 3 2 \u03b6\u03030\u2202\u0303\u03b60 . (2.22)\nThe non-trivial brackets among the infinitesimal generators D1, Va , D, Pi , Xi , Z of the L-action on N are given by:\n= \u22122\u03b4 ji Z , [Xi , D] = Xi 2 , [Pi , D] = Pi 2 , [Z , D] = Z ,\n[P0, Va] = Pa, [Va, Pb] = kabcXc, [Va, Xb] = \u03b4ba X0, [Va, D1] = Va, [P0, D1] = \u22123\n2 P0, [Pa, D1] = \u22121 2 Pa, [X0, D1] = 3 2 X0, [Xa, D1] = 1 2 Xa .\n(2.23)\nCombining previous remarks for the c-map and r-map, we find that in the tree-level q-map case we have N = M \u00d7 L2 \u223c= H\u00d7 L , and that we can write gN using (2.10) and (2.16) as\ngN = 1\n4 gH + gL(p) , (2.24)\nwhere gL(p) is a family of left-invariant metrics on L , parametrized by p \u2208 H."

            "text": "Let (N , gN )be a tree-level q-map space.Wewill first define two sets of global coordinates on N , usually called in the physics literature the type IIA and type IIB coordinates. These coordinates are related by the so-called \u201cclassical mirror map\u201d2, which in our case will just be a certain diffeomorphism of N . We then define the S-duality SL(2, R)-action on N , following the usual action of S-duality on the type IIB fields [BGHL00]. We will describe how the resulting SL(2, R) action interacts with the universal group of isometries L , and use this to show that the S-duality SL(2, R)-action acts by isometries on any tree-level q-map metric. We then finish the section showing that one can combine the S-duality isometries with the L-action isometries into a Lie group G of universal isometries for tree-level q-map spaces.\n3.1. The type IIA and type IIB variables. We start by discussing two systems of global coordinates on N , the so-called type IIA and type IIB coordinates. While the tree-level q-map metrics and the action of the universal group of isometries L = L1 \u03d5h L2 are more naturally expressed in terms of type IIA coordinates, the S-duality action is more naturally described in terms of type IIB coordinates.\nDefinition 3.1. Wedefine two systems of global coordinates on N = M\u00d7R>0\u00d7R2n+2\u00d7 R:\n\u2022 The global coordinates (za, \u03c1, \u03b6\u0303i , \u03b6 i , \u03c3 ) \u2208 M \u00d7 R>0 \u00d7 R2n+2 \u00d7 R in which gN is expressed in (2.11) will be called type IIA coordinates. \u2022 On the other hand, by isolating one of the R-factors of R2n+2 \u2282 N and combining it with the factor R>0 \u2282 N as the upper half-plane H := R + iR>0 we can consider another set of global coordinates on N given by (ba + i ta, \u03c41 + i\u03c42, ca, ca, c0, \u03c8) \u2208\n2 We use quotes because there is a priori no underlying Calabi\u2013Yaumanifold, and hence no relation between moduli of mirror Calabi\u2013Yau\u2019s.\nM\u00d7H\u00d7Rn\u00d7Rn\u00d7R\u00d7R = N , related to the type IIA coordinates via the so-called classical mirror map [BGHL00,AP12]:\n\u03c1 = \u03c4 2 2\n2 h(t), za = ba + i ta, \u03b6 0 = \u03c41, \u03b6 a = \u2212(ca \u2212 \u03c41ba),\n\u03b6\u0303a = ca + kabc 2 bb(cc \u2212 \u03c41bc), \u03b6\u03030 = c0 \u2212 kabc 6 babb(cc \u2212 \u03c41bc)\n\u03c3 = \u22122(\u03c8 + 1 2 \u03c41c0) + ca(c a \u2212 \u03c41ba)\u2212 kabc 6 bacb(cc \u2212 \u03c41bc) ,\n(3.1)\nwhere we recall that h(t) is the cubic polynomial defining the PSR manifold:\nh(t) = 1 6 kabct atbtc . (3.2)\nThe coordinates (ba + i ta, \u03c41 + i\u03c42, c0, ca, ca, \u03c8) related to (za, \u03c1, \u03b6\u0303i , \u03b6 i , \u03c3 ) via (3.1) will be called type IIB variables.\nRemark 3.2. It is not hard to check that (3.1) is a diffeomorphism between the two global coordinates. Indeed, the inverse can be written explicitly as \u03c42 = \u221a 2h\u22121(t)\u03c1, ba + i ta = za, \u03c41 = \u03b6 0, ca = \u2212(\u03b6 a \u2212 \u03b6 0ba)\nca = \u03b6\u0303a + kabc 2 bb\u03b6 c, c0 = \u03b6\u03030 \u2212 kabc 6 babb\u03b6 c\n\u03c8 = \u2212\u03c3 2 \u2212 \u03b6\n0\n2 (\u0303\u03b60 \u2212 kabc 6 babb\u03b6 c)\u2212 \u03b6\na\n2 (\u0303\u03b6a + kabc 2 bb\u03b6 c)\u2212 kabc 12\nba\u03b6 b(\u03b6 c \u2212 \u03b6 0bc) . (3.3)\nIn the first equation, we have used that h(t) > 0 on M , so that \u03c42 = \u221a 2h\u22121(t)\u03c1 is valued in R>0.\n3.2. The S-duality action. Consider N with the global type IIB variables (ba + i ta, \u03c41 + i\u03c42, ca, ca, c0, \u03c8) fromDefinition3.1. In these variables,wedefine the followingSL(2, R)action [BGHL00,AP12]:\n\u03c4 := \u03c41 + i\u03c42 \u2192 a\u03c4 + b c\u03c4 + d , ta \u2192 |c\u03c4 + d|ta, ca \u2192 ca, ( ca\nba\n) \u2192 ( a b c d )( ca ba ) , ( c0 \u03c8 ) \u2192 ( d \u2212c \u2212b a ) ( c0 \u03c8 ) , ( a b c d ) \u2208 SL(2, R) (3.4)\nDefinition 3.3. The SL(2, R)-action defined by (3.4) will be called the S-duality action. Proposition 3.4. With respect to the decomposition N \u223c= H\u00d7 L, and the corresponding decomposition of the metric gN = 14gH + gL(p) from (2.24), the S-duality action is a fiber-wise action with respect to the projection into the first factor\nN \u2192 H, (za = ba + i ta, \u03c1, \u03b6\u0303i , \u03b6 i , \u03c3 ) \u2192 ( ta\nh(t) 1 3\n) , (3.5)\nleaving the gH summand of gN invariant.\nProof. To prove that S-duality acts fiber-wise with respect to N \u2192 H, it is enough to observe that in type IIA variables it only acts on the ta-coordinates by an overall rescaling. This is obvious from (3.4) together with the fact that the classical mirror map (3.1) leaves ta invariant.\nOn the other hand, since S-duality acts trivially on the H-factor of N \u223c= H \u00d7 L , it follows that it leaves the 14gH summand of gN invariant.\nWe will now describe the infinitesimal S-duality action, both in type IIA and type IIB variables. We do this as follows: denote by e, f, h \u2208 sl(2, R) the generator of the Lie algebra sl(2, R) given by\ne = ( 0 1 0 0 ) , f = ( 0 0 1 0 ) , h = ( 1 0 0 \u22121 ) (3.6)\nsatisfying\n[e, f ] = h, [h, e] = 2e, [h, f ] = \u22122 f . (3.7) The infinitesimal action in type IIB variables is then described by the following lemma:\nLemma 3.5. Let Ye, Y f and Yh be the generators of the infinitesimal S-duality action in type IIB variables. Then:\nYe = \u2202\u03c41 + ba\u2202ca \u2212 c0\u2202\u03c8 Y f = (\u03c4 22 \u2212 \u03c4 21 )\u2202\u03c41 \u2212 2\u03c41\u03c42\u2202\u03c42 + \u03c41ta\u2202ta + ca\u2202ba \u2212 \u03c8\u2202c0 Yh = 2\u03c41\u2202\u03c41 + 2\u03c42\u2202\u03c42 \u2212 ta\u2202ta \u2212 ba\u2202ba + ca\u2202ca \u2212 c0\u2202c0 + \u03c8\u2202\u03c8\n(3.8)\nProof. This follows easily from a direct computation using the definition of the S-duality action in type IIB variables given in (3.4).\nBecause we want to see how S-duality interacts with the universal isometries L , and the latter are more naturally described in terms of type IIA variables, it will be convenient to describe S-duality in type IIA variables (at least infinitesimally). This amounts to conjugating the action (3.4) in type IIB variables by the mirror map (3.1) relating type IIA and type IIB variables. Given the complexity of the mirror map, the S-duality action in type IIA variables turns out to be quite complicated. We however can describe quite concisely the infinitesimal S-duality action in type IIA variables as follows:\nProposition 3.6. Let Xe, X f and Xh be the generators of the infinitesimal S-duality action on N expressed in type IIA variables. Then:\nXe = \u2202\u03b6 0 + \u03b6\u03030\u2202\u03c3 X f = (2\u03c1h(t)\u22121 \u2212 (\u03b6 0)2)\u2202\u03b6 0 + (2\u03c1h(t)\u22121ba \u2212 \u03b6 0\u03b6 a)\u2202\u03b6 a\n+ kabc 2 (\u03b6 b\u03b6 c \u2212 2bbbc\u03c1h(t)\u22121)\u2202\u0303\u03b6a + (1 2 (\u03c3 + \u03b6 i \u03b6\u0303i ) + kabc 3 \u03c1h(t)\u22121babbbc ) \u2202\u0303\u03b60 +\u03b6 0ta\u2202ta + (\u03b6 0ba \u2212 \u03b6 a)\u2202ba \u2212 \u03b6 0\u03c1\u2202\u03c1 + [ 2\u03c1h(t)\u22121 ( \u2212 \u03b6\u03030 \u2212 ba \u03b6\u0303a \u2212 kabc\n(babb\u03b6 c 2 \u2212 b abbbc\u03b6 0 6 )) \u2212 \u03b6 0 2 (\u03c3 \u2212 \u03b6\u0303i\u03b6 i )\n+ kabc 6\n\u03b6 a\u03b6 b\u03b6 c ] \u2202\u03c3\nXh = 2\u03b6 0\u2202\u03b6 0 + \u03b6 a\u2202\u03b6 a \u2212 \u03b6\u03030\u2202\u0303\u03b60 + \u03c3\u2202\u03c3 + \u03c1\u2202\u03c1 \u2212 ta\u2202ta \u2212 ba\u2202ba (3.9)\nProof. LetM : N \u2192 N be theMirrormap from type IIB to type IIA variables described in (3.1). The expressions for Xe, X f and Xh in terms of Ye, Y f and Yh given in Lemma 3.5 can then be found via\ndM(Ye|M\u22121(p)) = Xe|p, dM(Y f |M\u22121(p)) = X f |p, dM(Yh |M\u22121(p)) = Xh |p . (3.10)\nIn order to perform these computations, one then needs to compute the infinitesimal mirror map dM. The relevant expressions are given by\ndM(\u2202\u03c42) = \u03c42e\u2212K\n8 \u2202\u03c1, dM(\u2202ta ) = \u2212\u03c1\u2202taK\u2202\u03c1 + \u2202ta\ndM(\u2202\u03c41) = \u2202\u03b6 0 + ba\u2202\u03b6 a \u2212 kabc 2 bbbc\u2202\u0303\u03b6a + kabc 6 babbbc\u2202\u0303\u03b60\n+ ( \u2212 c0 \u2212 caba + kabc\n6 babbcc\n) \u2202\u03c3\ndM(\u2202ba ) = \u2202ba + \u03c41\u2202\u03b6 a + kabc (1 2 cc \u2212 \u03c41bc ) \u2202\u0303\u03b6b\n+ kabc ( \u2212 1\n3 bbcc +\n1 2 bbbc\u03c41 ) \u2202\u0303\u03b60\n+ ( \u2212 ca\u03c41 + kabc (\u03c41bbcc 3 \u2212 c bcc 6 )) \u2202\u03c3\ndM(\u2202ca ) = \u2212\u2202\u03b6 a + kabc 2 bc\u2202\u0303\u03b6b \u2212 kabc 6 bbbc\u2202\u0303\u03b60 + ( ca \u2212 kabc 3 bbcc + kabc 6 bbbc\u03c41 ) \u2202\u03c3 dM(\u2202ca ) = \u2202\u0303\u03b6a + ca\u2202\u03c3 , dM(\u2202c0) = \u2202\u0303\u03b60 \u2212 \u03c41\u2202\u03c3 , dM(\u2202\u03c8) = \u22122\u2202\u03c3 .\n(3.11)\nThe result then follows from a straightforward, but rather tedious, computation using (3.11), (3.8) and (3.1). More details on the computation are given in Appendix A. Remark 3.7. As can be seen from (3.9), while Xe and Xh are very simple, X f is highly non-trivial in the usual type IIA variables in which gN is written. This complexity is expected, since in the string theory setting S-duality is non-manifest in type IIAvariables.\nProposition 3.8. Xe and Xh are Killing vector fields on (N , gN ). Proof. Notice that from Proposition 3.6 and equation (2.14) we find that Xe = P0, where P0 is one of the generators of the Heisenberg group action given in Sect. 2.4. Furthermore, notice that\nXh = D \u2212 D1 (3.12) where D is the generator of the dilation action of Iwa(SU (1, n + 2)) given in (2.14), while D1 is the generator of the dilation action coming from thePSRmanifold isometries, given in (2.22). Since P0, D and D1 are Killing fields, we conclude that Xe and Xh must also be Killing fields.\nRemark 3.9. Notice that Xe is a Killing vector field of any c-map space (including the 1-loop deformations). However, the fact that Xh is Killing really uses the fact that we are on the tree-level q-map space case. It is easy to check that Xh (and hence X f ) is no longer a Killing field if we set the 1-loop parameter to c = 0.\nThe fact that the remaining vector field X f is Killing in the tree-level case is harder to show, and will be proven in Sect. 3.4, using the results from the following section.\n3.3. The universal group L = L1 \u03d5h L2 of isometries and S-duality. In this section we wish to show how S-duality interacts with the universal group of isometries L = L1 \u03d5h L2 of (N , gN ) given in Sect. 2.6. We will use this in the next section to show that X f is a Killing field, and hence that S-duality acts by isometries.\nRecall the generators D1, D, Va, Pi , Xi , Z of the left action of L on N given in Sect. 2.6, and the generators Xe, X f , Xh of the S-duality action given in (3.9). Furthermore, recall from Proposition 3.8 that\nXe = P0, Xh = D \u2212 D1 . (3.13)\nWe can therefore interchange the generator D1 with Xh , and generate the infinitesimal L-action by D, Va, Pi , Xi , Z , Xh .\nProposition 3.10. If dim(H) = n\u22121 \u2265 0, there is a 3n+6 dimensional Lie algebra g of vector fields on N generated by D, Xi , Pa, P0 = Xe, X f , Xh = D \u2212 D1, Va, Z where a = 1, . . . , n and i = 0, 1, . . . , n, satisfying the following commutation relations: \u2022 D, Xi , Pi and Z have the non-trivial commutation relations:\n[Pi , X j ] = \u22122\u03b4 ji Z , [Xi , D] = Xi 2 , [Pi , D] = Pi 2 , [Z , D] = Z . (3.14)\n\u2022 Xe, X f and Xh satisfy:\n[Xe, X f ] = \u2212Xh, [Xh, Xe] = \u22122Xe, [Xh, X f ] = 2X f . (3.15)\nIn particular, they span a subalgebra sl(2, R)op \u2282 g isomorphic to sl(2, R). Note that the linear map sl(2, R)\u2192 sl(2, R)op which maps (h, e, f ) to (Xh, Xe, X f ) is an anti-isomorphism. Multiplying it with \u22121 yields an isomorphism. \u2022 We have additionally the following non-trivial commutation relations:\n[P0, Va] = Pa, [Va, Pb] = kabcXc, [Va, Xb] = \u03b4ba X0, [Xh, Va] = Va [X f , Pa] = Va, [D, X f ] = X f\n2 , [Z , X f ] = X\n0\n2 [Pa, Xh] = Pa, [Xh, X0] = X0, [Z , Xh] = Z .\n(3.16)\nIn particular, the Va form an n-dimensional abelian subalgebra of Killing fields. It can be extended to an n +1 dimensional abelian subalgebra by adding either X0, D, X f or Z; and to an n + 2 dimensional abelian subalgebra by adding X0 and X f .\nProof. Most of the brackets follow from the already known brackets from Sects. 2.4 and 2.6, together with the identity (3.13). The brackets in (3.15) follow from the fact that Xe, X f and Xh are the fundamental vector fields of the action by left-multiplication in SL(2, R), i.e. the right-invariant vector fields which evaluate to e, f, h at the neutral element. The fact that they are right-invariant is responsible for the minus sign compared to the brakets of e, f, h \u2208 sl(2, R).\nSince the only new part of the algebra is obtained by the addition of X f , we include the computations of the brackets involving X f that are not obvious, namely: [X f , Xi ], [X f , V a], [X f , Pa], [X f , Z ] and [X f , D]. \u2022 [X f , Xi ]:\n[X f , X0] = \u2212(2\u03c1h\u22121 \u2212 (\u03b6 0)2)\u2202\u03c3 \u2212 (\u22122\u03c1h\u22121 + (\u03b6 0)2)\u2202\u03c3 = 0 [X f , Xa] = \u2212(2\u03c1h\u22121ba \u2212 \u03b6 0\u03b6 a)\u2202\u03c3 \u2212 (\u22122\u03c1h\u22121ba + \u03b6 0\u03b6 a)\u2202\u03c3 = 0 . (3.17)\n\u2022 [X f , V a]:\nX f (Va) = (2\u03c1h\u22121 \u2212 (\u03b6 0)2)\u2202\u03b6 a + kabc 2 (2bbbc\u03c1h\u22121 \u2212 \u03b6 b\u03b6 c)\u2202\u0303\u03b60 + kabc(\u03b6\n0\u03b6 c \u2212 2\u03c1h\u22121bc)\u2202\u0303\u03b6b Va(X f ) = X f (Va) \u21d2 [X f , V a] = 0 .\n(3.18)\n\u2022 [X f , Pa]:\nX f (Pa) = kabc 2 (\u03b6 b\u03b6 c \u2212 2bbbc\u03c1h\u22121)\u2202\u03c3 Pa(X f ) = \u2212Va + kabc 2 (\u03b6 b\u03b6 c \u2212 2bbbc\u03c1h\u22121)\u2202\u03c3 \u21d2 [X f , Pa] = Va . (3.19)\n\u2022 [Z , X f ]:\n[Z , X f ] = Z(X f )\u2212 0 = 1 2 (\u2202\u0303\u03b60 \u2212 \u03b6 0\u2202\u03c3 ) =\nX0\n2 . (3.20)\n\u2022 [D, X f ]: from the fact that the functions (za, \u03c1, \u03b6\u0303i , \u03b6 i , \u03c3 ) are eigenfunctions of D with the respective eigenvalues (0, 1, 12 , 1 2 , 1), we see that X f is an eigenvector of\nLD for the eigenvalue 12 , so that [D, X f ] = X f /2. Let g be the Lie algebra of vector fields on N from Proposition 3.10. Let\nh := span{Z , Pa, Xi }, n := span{Va, Z , Pa, Xi }, Rn := span{Va} . (3.21) Then the commutation relations of Proposition 3.10 show that n is a subalgebra of g, and that h \u2282 n is an ideal with complementary abelian subalgebra Rn , i.e.\nn = Rn h . (3.22) Furthermore, we see that\nu := span{Xe, X f , Xh, V a, Z , Pa, Xi } (3.23)\nis a subalgebra of g, which splits as\nu = sl(2, R)op n . (3.24)\nFinally, it is easy to check that [D, u] \u2282 u, such that\ng = RD u . (3.25)\nWe can summarize the results as follows.\nCorollary 3.11. The Lie algebra g of Proposition 3.10 has the structure\ng = RD u = RD (sl2(R)op n) = RD (sl2(R)op (Rn h)) . (3.26)\nWe furthermore have:\nCorollary 3.12. The subalgebra n \u2282 g is the nilradical of g. Proof. The fact that n is an ideal follows immediately from the commutation relations of g given in Proposition 3.10. On the other hand, the fact that it is nilpotent follows from the fact that n1 = [n, n] = span{X0, Xa, Z}, n2 = [n, n1] = span{Z , X0}, n3 = [n, n2] = {0}. In the previous computation of n1 we used that span{kabcXc} = span{Xc}, which follows from the non-degeneracy of the Hessian of the cubic polynomial, together with [BC02, Lemma 1]. Finally, to show that its maximal, assume that n\u2032 \u2283 n is any ideal strictly bigger that n. It is not difficult to show using the commutation relations that either n\u2032 contains sl2(R)op, in which case it cannot be nilpotent; or it does not contain sl2(R)\nop and n\u2032 = n\u2295 R(4D \u2212 Xh), which is neither nilpotent, since [n\u2032, n\u2032] = n and [n\u2032, n] = n. Corollary 3.13. The Levi-Malcev decomposition of the Lie algebra g of Proposition 3.10 is given by\ng = sl2(R)op (RD\u2032 n),\nwhere\nD\u2032 = 4D \u2212 Xh \u2208 RD sl2(R)op = RD\u2032 \u2295 sl2(R)op \u223c= gl2(R).\nHere sl2(R)op \u223c= sl2(R) is the Levi subgroup and r = RD\u2032 n is the radical, which happens to be non-unimodular and contains the nilradical n as a codimension one ideal.\nProof. From the commutation relations of Proposition 3.10 we see that D\u2032 commutes with sl2(R)op and that the operator adD\u2032 |n has the eigenspace decomposition\nspan{X0, Z} \u2295 span{Xa} \u2295 span{Va, Pa}\nwith the respective eigenvalues (\u22123,\u22122,\u22121). In particular, tr(adD\u2032) = \u22124n \u2212 6 = 0, which shows that the radical r = RD\u2032 n is not unimodular.\n3.4. The (3n+6)-dimensional group of universal isometries. In Proposition 3.8 we have shown that Xe and Xh are Killing vector fields. Here we wish to show that the remaining generator X f of S-duality is also a Killing vector field, which will imply that S-duality acts by isometries. We will later show that the L-action and S-duality combine into a 3n + 6-dimensional connected Lie group G of universal isometries of (N , gN ).\nTo show that X f is a Killing field, we will use some of the previous algebra structure found in Proposition 3.10 to simplify the computation. In the following, we consider the PSR manifold H as embedded in N = R\u03c1>0 \u00d7 M \u00d7 R2n+3 via\np = (xa) \u2208 H\u2192 (1, 0 + i xa, 0) \u2208 R\u03c1>0 \u00d7 M \u00d7 R2n+3 = N . (3.27)\nLemma 3.14. Assume that we have shown that LX f gN (p) = 0 for p \u2208 H \u2282 N. Then LX f gN = 0 on N. Proof. In the following, it will be convenient to consider the nested submanifoldsH = N 0 \u2282 N 1 \u2282 N 2 \u2282 N 3 = N defined by\nN 1 := {(\u03c1, ba + i ta, \u03b6 i , \u03b6\u0303i , \u03c3 ) \u2208 N | ba = \u03b6 i = \u03b6\u0303i = \u03c3 = 0, \u03c1 = 1} N 2 := {(\u03c1, ba + i ta, \u03b6 i , \u03b6\u0303i , \u03c3 ) \u2208 N | ba = \u03b6 i = \u03b6\u0303i = \u03c3 = 0} (3.28)\nso that by our assumptions LX f gN |N0 = 0. We want to show that LX f gN |Ni = 0 implies that LX f gN |Ni+1 = 0, with the final step then showing that LX f gN = 0.\nWith respect to the coordinates (xi ) = (\u03c1, ba + i ta, \u03b6 0, \u03b6 a, \u03b6\u03030, \u03b6\u0303a, \u03c3 ) we will denote LX f gN = Ti j dxi dx j . We first consider the Killing field D1 = D \u2212 Xh , satisfying\n[D1, X f ] = \u22123 2 X f . (3.29)\nFrom this and the fact that D1 is Killing we find that\nLD1LX f gN = \u2212 3\n2 LX f gN (3.30)\nwhich we can write in the previous coordinates (xi ) as\nD1(Ti j ) + Tkj\u2202xi D k 1 + Tik\u2202x j D k 1 = \u2212\n3 2 Ti j . (3.31)\nDenoting the flow of D1 as D1,t , we obtain the following system of first order, linear, homogeneous ODEs satisfied by the Ti j ( D1,t (p)) for p \u2208 N :\nd dt Ti j ( D1,t (p)) + Tkj ( D1,t (p))\u2202xi D k 1 + Tik( D1,t (p))\u2202x j D k 1 + 3 2 Ti j ( D1,t (p)) = 0 .\n(3.32)\nIn particular, we find that if p \u2208 H, then the Ti j ( D1,t (p)) give a solution to the previous system satisfying the initial condition Ti j ( D1,0(p)) = Ti j (p) = 0. Hence, we must have that for all p \u2208 H and all t\nTi j ( D1,t (p)) = 0 . (3.33)\nSince D1|N1 = ta\u2202ta , we find that for (1, 0 + i ta, 0) \u2208 H D1,t (1, 0 + i t\na, 0) = (1, 0 + iet ta, 0) (3.34) so that we conclude that Ti j |N1 = 0 and hence LX f gN |N1 = 0.\nNext we consider the Killing field D, which satisfies [D, X f ] = 12 X f . Since 3D + D1 = 4D \u2212 Xh is a Killing field commuting with X f , we see that LX f gN is invariant under the flow of 3D + D1. Note that applying the flow to N 1 we obtain N 2. This follows from the fact that 3D + D1 = 3\u03c1\u2202\u03c1 + ta\u2202ta on N 2. From LX f gN |N1 = 0 we hence conclude that LX f gN |N2 = 0. (Alternatively, we could have applied a similar argument as for D1 to the flow of D.)\nFinally, using the brackets:\n[X f , P0] = Xh, , [X f , Pa] = Va, [X f , Xi ] = 0, [X f , Z ] = \u2212X0/2 (3.35) and the fact that Xh , Pi , Xi , Z and Va are Killing one obtains that LX f gN is invariant under the transformation group generated by the Lie algebra\nR n heis2n+3 = span{Va, Pi , Xi , Z}. Since the orbit of N 2 \u2282 N under that group is the whole manifold N and LX f gN2 = 0, we conclude that LX f gN = 0. Proposition 3.15. X f is a Killing vector field on (N , gN ). Proof. By the previous lemma, we only need to check that LX f gN = 0 on points of the form (\u03c1, ba + i ta, \u03b6 i , \u03b6\u0303i , \u03c3 ) = (1, 0 + i ta, 0, 0, 0) where the ta satisfy h(ta) = 1 (i.e. on points of H \u2282 N ).\nIn the following all the Lie derivatives will be evaluated at points (1, 0+i ta, 0, 0, 0) \u2208 H \u2282 N . We then have\nLX f (d\u03c12 4\u03c12 )\u2223\u2223\u2223H = \u2212 1 2 d\u03b6 0d\u03c1 (3.36)\nand using equation (2.9) we find\nLX f gM \u2223\u2223\u2223H = kabctbtc 4 d\u03b6 0dta + (kabctc 2 \u2212 kacdkbe f t ctd tet f 8 ) d\u03b6 adbb (3.37)\nFurthermore, the Lie derivative of the line-bundle term gives:\nLX f ( 1 64\u03c12 (d\u03c3 + \u03b6\u0303i d\u03b6 i \u2212 \u03b6 i d \u03b6\u0303i )2 )\u2223\u2223\u2223H = \u2212 1 8 d\u03c3d \u03b6\u03030 (3.38)\nComputing the Lie derivative of the remaining term of gN\nLX f ( \u2212 1\n4\u03c1 (Ni j \u2212 2 K zi z j )WiW j\n) (3.39)\nis a little bit more tricky. We do this in steps: we first have that\nLX f (Ni j ) \u2223\u2223\u2223H =\n( \u22123\u03b6 0N 00 \u22122\u03b6 0N 0a + \u03b6 a4h\n\u22122\u03b6 0N 0a + \u03b6 a4h \u2212\u03b6 0Nab + \u03b6 abb+ba\u03b6 b 4h ) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 H = 0 (3.40)\nLX f (2zi z j/K ) \u2223\u2223\u2223H =\n( \u22126 \u03b6 0K \u22124 z a\u03b6 0 K \u2212 2 \u03b6 a K\n\u22124 za\u03b6 0K \u2212 2 \u03b6 a K \u22122 z a zb\u03b6 0 K \u2212 2 \u03b6 a zb+za\u03b6 b K ) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 H = 0 (3.41)\nLX f (\u03c4i j (z)) \u2223\u2223\u2223H = (\u2212kabczazb(\u03b6 0zc \u2212 \u03b6 c) kabczb(\u03b6 0zc \u2212 \u03b6 c) kabczb(\u03b6 0zc \u2212 \u03b6 c) \u2212kabc(\u03b6 0zc \u2212 \u03b6 c) ) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 H = 0 (3.42)\nIn particular, from (3.42) one obtains\nLX f (W0)|H = 1\n2 d\u03c3 + kabct btcdba \u2212 2i 3 kabct atbtcd(\u03c1h\u22121)\n= 1 2 d\u03c3 + kabct btcdba \u2212 4id\u03c1 + 2ikabctatbdtc\nLX f (Wa)|H = 2ikabctcdba + kabctbtcd(\u03c1h\u22121) = 2ikabctcdba + kabctbtcd\u03c1 \u2212 1\n2 kabct\nbtckde f t d tedt f\n(3.43)\nDenoting\nAi j := (Ni j \u2212 2 K zi z j ) (3.44)\nwe can then use the previous results to compute\nLX f ( \u2212 1\n4\u03c1 Ai jWiW j )\u2223\u2223\u2223H = ( \u2212 1 4\u03c1 [ LX f (A00|W0|2)\n+ LX f (A0aW0Wa + Aa0WaW 0) + LX f (AabWaWb) ])\u2223\u2223\u2223H\n= 1 4\n[ Re ( LX f (W0)W 0 )\u2223\u2223\u2223H \u2212 ta 2 Re(LX f (iW0)Wa + LX f (Wa)iW0) \u2223\u2223\u2223H \u2212 ( \u2212 t atb\n2 + Gab 2 ) Re(LX f (Wa)Wb) \u2223\u2223\u2223H ]\n(3.45)\nFor each of the terms above we obtain\n1 4 Re\n( LX f (W0)W 0 )\u2223\u2223\u2223H = 1 8 d\u03c3d \u03b6\u03030 + 1 16 kabct btcd\u03b6 ad\u03c3 + 1 4 kabct btcdbad \u03b6\u03030\n+ 1\n8 kacd t\nctdkbe f t et f dbad\u03b6 b + 2d\u03c1d\u03b6 0 \u2212 kabctbtcdtad\u03b6 0 (3.46)\n\u2212 t a\n8 Re\n( LX f (iW0)Wa )\u2223\u2223\u2223H = \u2212 t a\n2 d\u03c1d \u03b6\u0303a \u2212 3 2 d\u03c1d\u03b6 0 +\nta 4 kbcd t ctddtbd \u03b6\u0303a + 3 4 kbcd t ctddtbd\u03b6 0\n\u2212 1 16 kabct atcd\u03b6 bd\u03c3 \u2212 1 8 kdbct btckae f t atedbdd\u03b6 f (3.47)\n\u2212 t a\n8 Re\n( LX f (Wa)iW0 )\u2223\u2223\u2223H = \u22123\n2 d\u03c1d\u03b6 0 +\n3 4 kbcd t ctddtbd\u03b6 0 \u2212 1 4 kabct atcdbbd \u03b6\u03030\n\u22121 8 kabct atckde f t etddbbd\u03b6 f (3.48)\n1\n4 ( tatb 2 \u2212 G ab 2 ) Re(LX f (Wa)Wb) \u2223\u2223\u2223H = t b\n2 d\u03c1d \u03b6\u0303b +\n3 2 d\u03c1d\u03b6 0 \u2212 1 4 tbke f ht f thdted \u03b6\u0303b \u2212 3 4 kef ht f thdted\u03b6 0\n+ 1\n4 kadct\natckbe f t btedbdd\u03b6 f \u2212 1\n2 kbe f t\nedbbd\u03b6 f (3.49)\nSumming up all contributions, we find that\nLX f ( \u2212 1\n4\u03c1 Ai jWiW j )\u2223\u2223\u2223H = 1 2 d\u03b6 0d\u03c1 \u2212 kabct btc 4 d\u03b6 0dta\n\u2212 (kabctc\n2 \u2212 kacdkbe f t\nctd tet f\n8\n) d\u03b6 adbb + 1\n8 d\u03c3d \u03b6\u03030\n= \u2212LX f ( d\u03c1 4\u03c12 + gM + 1 64\u03c12 (d\u03c3 + \u03b6\u0303i d\u03b6 i \u2212 \u03b6 i d \u03b6\u0303i )2 )\u2223\u2223\u2223H (3.50)\nso that LX f gN |H = 0. By Lemma 3.14 we then conclude that LX f gN = 0. From the previous results we obtain\nTheorem 3.16. S-duality acts by isometries on tree-level q-map spaces (N , gN ).\nProof. We have shown in Propositions 3.8 and 3.15 that the generators of the infinitesimal S-duality action Xe, X f and Xh are Killing vectors. This implies that the S-duality action of SL(2, R) defined in equation (3.4) is isometric. Theorem 3.17. Let (N , gN ) be a tree-level q-map space associated with a PSRmanifold (H, gH) with dim(H) = n\u2212 1 \u2265 0. Then there is a (3n + 6)-dimensional connected Lie group of isometries G containing the isometries of the L-action and S-duality. The Lie algebra g of G has the structure\ng = RD (sl2(R)op (Rn h)) (3.51) with the brackets described in Sect. 3.3.\nProof. Consider the Lie algebras of Killing fields\nl := span{D, Xi , Pa, Xe, Xh, Va, Z}, sl(2, R)op = span{Xe, X f , Xh} , (3.52) corresponding to the infinitesimal L-action and the infinitesimal S-duality action. Furthermoredenote by Iso0(N , gN ) the identity component of the isometrygroupof (N , gN ). Since l \u2282 Lie(Iso0(N , gN )) and sl(2, R)op \u2282 Lie(Iso0(N , gN )) generate the Lie algebra g, we conclude that g \u2282 Lie(Iso0(N , gN )). It follows that there exists a unique connected Lie subgroup G \u2282 Iso0(N , gN ) with Lie(G) = g. Obviously G contains the isometries corresponding to the S-duality and L actions, while the structure of the Lie algebra g follows from the previous Corollary 3.11. Corollary 3.18. Recall the identification N \u223c= H \u00d7 L together with the decomposition (2.24) of gN as\ngN = 1\n4 gH + gL(p) (3.53)\nwhere gL(p) is a family of left-invariant metrics (with respect to the L-action) on L parametrized by p \u2208 H. Then G acts fiberwise by isometries with respect to the projection N \u2192 H. In particular, when restricted to a fiber L p \u223c= L, it acts by isometries on (L , gL(p)).\nProof. We already know that L and S-duality act fiberwise with respect to the projection N \u2192 H (Proposition 3.4). As a consequence, the same is true for the groupG generated by these groups.\nWe can therefore conjecture the following:\nConjecture 3.19. Let Iso0(L , gL(p)) be the connected component of the identity of the isometry group of (L , gL(p)). Then G can be characterized as the intersection \u2229p\u2208HIso0(L , gL(p)). Corollary 3.20. Let H \u2282 Rn be a PSR manifold and denote by Aut(H) := {A \u2208 GL(n, R) | AH = H} \u2282 Aut(h) := {A \u2208 GL(n, R) | A\u2217h = h}\nits group of automorphisms. ThenAut(H) acts by isometries on the corresponding treelevel q-map space (N , gN ). Moreover, this action normalizes the (3n + 6)-dimensional connected Lie group of isometries G of Theorem 3.17 such that we have a semi-direct product\nAut(H) G \u2282 Iso(N , gN ). Proof. The faithful isometric action of Aut(H) on N is explicitly described in [CDJL20, Appendix A]. An element A \u2208 Aut(H) \u2282 GL(n, R) acts naturally on M = Rn + iU , U = R>0 \u00b7 H, by the identification Rn + iU \u223c= TU . In formulas, this is simply z = (za = ba + i ta) \u2192 Az. The action is extended to N as follows:\n(\u03c1, z, \u03b6 0, \u03b6, \u03b6\u03030, \u03b6\u0303 , \u03c3 ) \u2192 (\u03c1, Az, \u03b6 0, A\u03b6, \u03b6\u03030, (A )\u22121\u03b6\u0303 , \u03c3 ), where \u03b6 = (\u03b6 a), \u03b6\u0303 = (\u03b6\u0303a) \u2208 Rn and (A )\u22121 is the contragredient matrix. We already know from [CDJL20, Appendix A] that this action normalizes the isometric action of the group L , which is simply transitive on each fiber of N \u2192 H. To see that it also normalizes the group G \u2283 L it suffices to observe that the vector field X f is manifestly invariant under the above action of Aut(H) \u2282 Aut(h). Theorem 3.21. Consider a tree-level q-map space (N , gN )associated to aPSRmanifold (H, h) with\nh(ta) = 1 6 kabct atbtc, kabc \u2208 Z . (3.54)\nFurthermore, recall the nilradical n \u2282 g from Corollary 3.12. Then there is a lattice of the normal and unimodular codimension 1 subgroup SL(2, R) exp(n) \u2282 G, acting by isometries on (N , gN ). The quotient gives a fiber bundle N/ \u2192 H with fibers of finite volume.\nProof. Consider the homomorphism \u03bb : g\u2192 R given by X \u2192 tr(adX), and notice that ker(\u03bb) = sl2(R)op n. It then follow that the corresponding codimension 1 subgroup SL(2, R) exp(n) \u2282 G is unimodular and normal.\nBy the commutators in Proposition 3.10 we see that n is a nilpotent Lie algebra with integer structure constants, under the assumption kabc \u2208 Z. Then by Malcev\u2019s theorem there is a lattice of the form exp( ) in the nilpotent group exp(n), where consists of the integer span of a Malcev basis (a particular case of a Malcev basis is given by (Pa, Va, X0, Xa, Z), corresponding to lower central series n = span{Pa, Va, X0, Xa, Z},n1 = [n, n] = span{X0, Xa, Z},n2 = [n, n1] = span{Z , X0}, n3 = [n, n2] = {0}). One can now check from the commutators in Proposition 3.10 that under the S-duality action of SL(2, Z) by automorphisms of n the lattice is preserved. This implies that the lattice exp(n) is normalized by SL(2, Z), so SL(2, Z) is a lattice in SL(2, R) exp(n) \u2282 G.\nNow we can take the quotient of the manifold N by SL(2, Z) , which amounts to taking a quotient of every orbit of SL(2, R) exp(n). The space of orbits isH, so we get a fiber bundle over H with orbits of finite volume.\nIn the following Sect. 3.5 we compute the fiber-wise volume density of N \u2192 Hwith respect to gN . We furthermore analyze the volume growth of the fibers of finite volume of N/ \u2192 H in the cases where H is a maximal PSR curve.\n3.5. Application: volume properties of q-map spaces associated to PSR curves. In this section we consider N/ \u2192 H obtained from Theorem 3.21 and study the volume properties of N/ when H is a PSR curve. Since N/ \u2192 H has finite volume fibers, N/ has a chance of having finite volume. We will see that this is the case only whenH is the incomplete PSR curve, giving rise to an incomplete QK manifold N/ of finite volume.\nLet (H, h) be a PSRmanifold of dimension n\u22121 \u2265 0 and (N , gN ) the corresponding tree-level q-map space of dimension 4n + 4. The fibers of the canonical projection \u03c0 : N \u2192 H are homogeneous submanifolds under the isometric action of the group SL(2, R) exp(n) \u2282 G from Theorem 3.21. We will consider H as a submanifold of N via the natural inclusion:\nH \u2282 H\u00d7 {(r, \u03c1, ba, \u03b6\u0303i , \u03b6 i , \u03c3 )} = H\u00d7 R2>0 \u00d7 R3n+3 \u223c= N , (3.55) provided by the global coordinates (ta, \u03c1, ba, \u03b6\u0303i , \u03b6 i , \u03c3 ), where t = (ta) \u2208 U = R>0 \u00b7 H \u223c= H \u00d7 R>0 is decomposed as t = rp with r = (h(t))1/3 and h(p) = 1. Notice that the fibers \u03c0\u22121(p) are orthogonal to H with respect to gN by (2.24).\nWe start by computing the fiber-wise volume density corresponding to (N , gN ) and \u03c0 : N \u2192 H. Namely, we compute the function \u03b4 \u2208 C\u221e(N ) defined by\ndetgN \u2223\u2223\u2223 (TpH)\u22a5 = (\u03b4(p)dvol f )\u22972 \u2208 ( 3n+5 ( (TpH)\u22a5 )\u2217)\u22972 \u223c= R , (3.56)\nwhere p \u2208 N , p = \u03c0(p), dvol f denotes the product of the the differentials of the fiber coordinates (r, \u03c1, ba, \u03b6\u0303i , \u03b6 i , \u03c3 ), and (TpH)\u22a5 denotes the orthogonal complement of TpH \u2282 TpN with respect to gN . We then study in Sect. 3.5.1 the case when H is a complete PSR curve, and study the volume growth of the finite volume fibers of N/ \u2192 H, where is as in Theorem 3.21. Proposition 3.22. The function \u03b4(p) is a positive constant multiple of\n\u03b4M\n\u03c1n+3 , (3.57)\nwhere \u03b4M \u2208 C\u221e(M) \u2282 C\u221e(N ) is the positive function defined by\ndetgM \u2223\u2223\u2223 (TpH)\u22a5M = (\u03b4M (p)dvolM, f )\u22972 \u2208 ( n+1 ( (TpH)\u22a5M )\u2217)\u22972 \u223c= R , (3.58)\nwhere dvolM, f denotes the product of the differentials of the fiber coordinates (r, b a) of the fibration M \u2192 H of the PSK manifold associated to the PSR manifold (H, h) via the r-map. Here (TpH)\u22a5M denotes the orthogonal complement in TpM. Proof. Consider the CASK manifold (M, gM , \u03c9M ,\u2207, \u03be) associated to (M, gM ). Its metric volume form is parallel to the flat connection \u2207, since it is a constant multiple of a power of the\u2207-parallel K\u00e4hler form\u03c9M . This implies that for\u2207-affine coordinates q I , I = 1, 2, . . . , 2n+2, the function det(gM (\u2202q I , \u2202q J )) is constant. Changing the indefinite metric gM , which in the present conventions is negative definite on D = span{\u03be, J\u03be}, to a positive definite metric g\u0302M by multiplying it by \u22121 on D yields a metric with the same volume form. Hence, det(g\u0302M (\u2202q I , \u2202q J )) is also constant. By [CHM12, Corollary 6] we know that the metric coefficients of the metric gN with respect to the coordinates (\u03b6I ) = (\u0303\u03b6i , \u03b6 i ) are given by\ngN (\u2202\u03b6I , \u2202\u03b6J ) = const \u03c1 g\u0302\u22121M (dq I , dq J ) . (3.59)\nwhere const \u2208 R>0. We conclude that (for a new const > 0)\ndetgN (\u2202\u03b6I , \u2202\u03b6J ) = const\n\u03c12n+2 . (3.60)\nObserving that the coefficients of d\u03c12 and (d\u03c3 + \u03b6\u0303i d\u03b6 i \u2212 \u03b6 i d \u03b6\u0303i )2 in gN have coefficients 1/\u03c12 (up to constant factors), it is then easy to check that the proposition follows. Proposition 3.23. The function \u03b4M \u2208 C\u221e(M) \u2282 C\u221e(N ) is given by\n\u03b4M (p) = \u221a 3 2n+1rn+1 \u221a det(\u03b3ab(p)), (3.61)\nwhere p \u2208 N, \u03c0(p) = p \u2208 H, p = (pa), and\n\u03b3ab(p) = \u2212kabc pc + 1 4 (kacd p c pd)(kbe f p e p f ) . (3.62)\nProof. This follows immediately from (2.10). Proposition 3.24. Consider the Riemannian metric gU = \u2212\u22022 log h on U = R>0 \u00b7H, the evaluation of which alongH is \u03b3abdtadtb. Furthermore, with respect to the natural coordinates ta, a = 1, 2, . . . , n, on U \u2282 Rn, let \u03be = ta\u2202ta . Then gU is related to the affine special real (ASR) metric gASR = \u2212\u22022h on U as follows:\ngU (\u03bep, \u03bep) = \u22121 2 gASR(\u03bep, \u03bep) = 3, gU |\u03be\u22a5p = gASR|\u03be\u22a5p (3.63)\nfor all p \u2208 H. Here \u03be\u22a5p = TpH \u2282 TpU = Rn denotes the orthogonal complement of the line R\u03bep with respect to gU (or equivalently gASR).\nProof. Using the homogeneity of h(t) = 16kabctatbtc we obtain gASR(\u03be, \u03be) = \u22126h, gU (\u03be, \u03be) = \u22126 + 9 = 3 . (3.64)\nRestriction toH then yields the first statement. The other equation follows from the fact that the one form kabctatbdtc vanishes on \u03be\u22a5p = TpH.\nFrom the previous proposition, we then obtain the following\nCorollary 3.25. For p \u2208 H \u2282 U we have\ndet(\u03b3ab(p)) = 1 2 (\u22121)n\u22121det\n( \u22022h(p)\n\u2202ta\u2202tb\n) (3.65)\nSummarizing, we obtain the following theorem:\nTheorem 3.26. The fiber volume density function \u03b4 \u2208 C\u221e(N ) of any tree-level q-map space \u03c0 : N \u2192 H is given by\n\u03b4(p) = const \u03c1n+3rn+1 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223det ( \u22022h(\u03c0(p)) \u2202ta\u2202tb )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 1/2 , (3.66)\nwhere const is a positive constant depending only on n = dim(H) + 1. In the following subsections we specialize to PSR curves, that is to the case dimH = 1. It is sufficient to consider maximal PSR curves.\nDefinition 3.27. A PSR curve H \u2282 {x \u2208 R2 | h(x) = 1} (see Definition 2.1) is called maximal if it is a connected component of the curve {x \u2208 R2 | h(x) = 1, det \u22022h(x) < 0}. Note that complete curves are always maximal but the converse is not true. The maximal PSR curves are listed in [CHM12, Theorem 8]. Up to isomorphism, there are precisely three maximal PSR curves: two are complete and one incomplete.\n3.5.1. The case of a complete PSR curve As an illustration, we will now compute the density function \u03b4 for the two complete PSR manifolds of dimension 1. By Theorem 3.26 this amounts to computing the function\nh := \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223det ( \u22022h\n\u2202ta\u2202tb\n)\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 1/2\n(3.67)\nalongH. Recall that there are two complete PSR curves [CHM12, Theorem 8], which are distinguished by the fact that one is homogeneous, that is has a transitive automorphism group, whereas the other has a finite automorphism group. To minimize the number of parentheses (in expressions like (t1)2), we will denote the coordinates of R2 by x1, x2 rather than t1, t2, since powers of the coordinates will be involved in the explicit expressions.\nLet be a lattice in SL(2, R) exp(n) \u2282 Iso(N , gN ) and denote by N/ the corresponding quotient manifold. The main qualitative result of this section is that the volume of the fibers of N/ along the two ends of the base curve is either asymptotically exponentially increasing or asymptotically decreasing to zero. The homogeneous PSR\ncurve has ends of both typeswhile the inhomogeneous complete PSR curve has divergent volume along both ends.\nWe first consider the PSR curve\nH := {(x1, x2) | x21 x2 = 1, x1 > 0}. (3.68) It is the unique homogeneous PSR curve, up to isomorphism. Its associated tree-level q-map space turns out to be the symmetric space N = SO0(3,4)SO(3)\u00d7SO(4) [CHM12, Corollary 4]. We denote by h(x) = x21 x2 the corresponding cubic polynomial. A straightforward calculation shows that\nh = 2x1 . (3.69) Next we compute the PSR metric in the global coordinate x1 in order to determine the volume density of N along H. Proposition 3.28. Themetric gH = \u2212\u03b9\u2217\u22022h of the homogeneous PSR curve \u03b9 : H\u2192 R2 is given by\ngH = 6dx 2 1\nx21 . (3.70)\nIn particular, its arc-length parameter s measured from (x1, x2) = (1, 1) \u2208 H is given by s = \u221a6 log(x1). Proof. Eliminating x2 = 1/x21 we compute\ngH = \u22122x2dx21 \u2212 4x1dx1dx2 = 6 dx21 x21 . (3.71)\nProposition 3.29. The fiber-wise volume density of the tree-level q-map space N =\nSO0(3,4) SO(3)\u00d7SO(4) associated to the homogeneous PSR curve (H, h) has the following form with respect to the coordinates (s, r, \u03c1, \u03c3, \u03b6 i , \u03b6\u0303i ).\n\u03b4 = const \u03c15r3 exp ( s\u221a 6 ) . (3.72)\nProof. This follows from Theorem 3.26 together with the results of this subsection. Corollary 3.30. After taking a quotient of N \u2192 H by a lattice in the fiber-wise preserving group SL(2, R) exp(n) \u2282 Iso(N ), the fiber-wise volume increases exponentially along the homogeneous PSR curve H for s \u2192 \u221e, and decreases exponentially for s \u2192\u2212\u221e. In particular, the total volume is infinite.\nNext we consider the curve\nH := {(x1, x2) | x1(x21 \u2212 x22 ) = 1, x1 > 0} (3.73) with cubic polynomial h(x) = x31 \u2212 x1x22 . It is the unique inhomogeneous complete PSR curve, up to isomorphism. A direct computation shows that\n2h = 16x21 \u2212 4\nx1 . (3.74)\nIn particular, we see that we have the asymptotics h \u223c 4x1 as x1\u2192\u221e. To interpret the result, we need to compare x1 with the arc-length parameter of H.\nProposition 3.31. The metric gH = \u2212\u03b9\u2217\u22022h of the inhomogeneous complete PSR curve \u03b9 : H\u2192 R2 is given with respect to the (local) coordinate x1 > 1 by:\ngH = 6 x21 ( 1\u2212 1/(4x31) 1\u2212 1/x31 ) dx21 . (3.75)\nIn particular, the arc length parameter s measured from (x1, x2) = (1, 0) satisfies s \u223c\u221a 6 log(x1) as x1 \u2192\u221e. (Hence the asymptotics coincides with the exact value for the homogeneous curve). Proof. Eliminating x2 = \u00b1 \u221a x21 \u2212 1/x1 we obtain\ngH = \u22126x1dx21 + 4x2dx1dx2 + 2x1dx22 = ( \u22126x1 + 2(2x1 + 1/x21 ) + (2x1 + 1/x21 ) 2\n2(x1 \u2212 1/x21 )\n) dx21\n= 6 x21 ( 1\u2212 1/(4x31) 1\u2212 1/x31 ) dx21 .\n(3.76)\nCorollary 3.32. Consider the inhomogeneous complete PSR curve H and the corresponding complete [CHM12, Theorem 4 and 5] (compare [CDJL20]) q-map space (N , gN ). Then the fiber-wise volume density of the QK manifold in the coordinates (s, r, \u03c1, \u03c3, \u03b6\u0303i , \u03b6 i ) satisfies\n\u03b4 \u223c const \u03c15r3 exp ( s\u221a 6 ) , s \u2192\u221e , (3.77)\nwhere s \u223c \u221a6 log(x1) is the arc length parameter on H. In other words, the asymptotics coincide with the exact value obtained for the q-map space associated to the homogeneous PSR curve.\nCorollary 3.33. After taking a quotient of N \u2192 H by a lattice in SL(2, R) exp(n) \u2282 Iso(N , gN ), the fiber-wise volume increases exponentially as a function of the arc-length parameter s along both ends of H. In particular, the total volume is infinite. Proof. Note that contrary to the homogeneous case of Corollary 3.30, in this case we have s \u2192\u221e along both ends of the curve, since 1 \u2264 x1 <\u221e. Remark 3.34. This symmetric behavior is consistent with the fact that \u03b8 : (x1, x2) \u2192 (x1,\u2212x2) is an automorphism exchanging the two ends of the curve H and extending to an isometry of (N , gN ) normalizing SL(2, R) exp(n) \u2282 Iso(N , gN ), by Corollary 3.20. Moreover, the lattice can be chosen to be invariant under the above involution of N , such that it induces a fiber-preserving isometric involution of the quotient space, inducing the map \u03b8 on H.\n3.5.2. The case of an incomplete PSR curve Finally, we consider the curve\nH : = {(x1, x2) | x1(x21 + x22 ) = 1, 3x21 \u2212 x22 < 0, x2 > 0} = {(x1, x2) | x1(x21 + x22 ) = 1, 0 < x1 < 4\u22121/3, x2 > 0},\n(3.78)\nassociated to the cubic polynomial h(x) = x1(x21 + x22 ). It gives the unique incomplete maximal PSR curve [CHM12], up to isomorphism.\nIn this case, we have for x \u2208 H that\n2h = 4\nx1 \u2212 16x21 , (3.79)\nso that 2h \u2192 0 as x1\u2192 4\u22121/3, and 2h \u223c 4/x1 as x1\u2192 0. Proposition 3.35. The metric gH = \u2212\u03b9\u2217\u22022h of the incomplete PSR curve \u03b9 : H\u2192 R2 is given with respect to the the global coordinate 0 < x1 < 4\u22121/3 by:\ngH = 6 x21 ( 1\u2212 1/(4x31) 1\u2212 1/x31 ) dx21 . (3.80)\nIn particular, if s denotes the arc length parameterwe have s \u223c \u2212 \u221a\n3 2 log(x1) as x1\u2192 0,\nwhile s \u223c const as x1\u2192 4\u22121/3. Proof. Eliminating x2 = \u00b1 \u221a 1/x1 \u2212 x21 we obtain\ngH = \u22126x1dx21 \u2212 4x2dx1dx2 \u2212 2x1dx22 = ( \u22126x1 + 2(2x1 + 1/x21 ) + (2x1 + 1/x21 ) 2\n2(x1 \u2212 1/x21 )\n) dx21\n= 6 x21 ( 1\u2212 1/(4x31) 1\u2212 1/x31 ) dx21 .\n(3.81)\nCorollary 3.36. Consider the incomplete PSR curve H and the corresponding q-map space (N , gN ). Then the fiber-wise volume density of the QKmanifold in the coordinates (s, r, \u03c1, \u03c3, \u03b6\u0303i , \u03b6 i ) satisfies\n\u03b4 \u223c const \u03c15r3 exp ( \u2212 \u221a 2s\u221a 3 ) , s \u2192\u221e , (3.82)\nwhere s \u223c \u2212 \u221a\n3 2 log(x1) is the arc length parameter onH.\nCorollary 3.37. After taking a quotient of N \u2192 H by a lattice in SL(2, R) exp(n) \u2282 Iso(N , gN ), the fiber-wise volume decreases exponentially as a function of the arc-length parameter s along the end ofH corresponding to s \u2192\u221e, and remains of finite volume on the other end corresponding to (x1, x2) = (4\u22121/3, 31/2 \u00b7 4\u22121/3). In particular, we obtain that the (incomplete) QK manifold N/ is of finite volume.\nRemark 3.38. In [CT22], certain instanton corrections to c-map spaces were studied, where the instanton corrections are encoded in the notion of mutually local variation of BPS structures. When including such instanton corrections, several of the previous universal continuous isometries of the tree-level q-map space are either broken, or expected to be broken down to a discrete subgroup. For example, the SL(2, R) isometries are expected to break down to a discrete subgroup SL(2, Z) [AP12]; while the isometries corresponding to the Killing fields Pi are broken down to a discrete group [CT22, Corollary 5.7 and Remark 5.8]. Provided the lattice \u2282 SL(2, R) exp(n) thus acts by isometries of the instanton corrected quaternionic K\u00e4hler metric, one can then ask whether the instanton corrections to N/ can be chosen such as to remove the incompleteness of the previous example while keeping the volume finite. This would give examples of complete QK manifolds with finite volume."

            "text": "Let (Z, I, \u03bb, \u03c4 ) be the twistor space of the tree-level q-map space (N , gN ), where I denotes the complex structure, \u03bb the holomorphic contact structure, and \u03c4 the real structure (see [Sal82,Swa91]). In this section we wish to do a mathematical treatment of previous results from the physics literature [NPV07,APSV09,AP12] discussing holomorphic Darboux coordinates for \u03bb, and the lift of S-duality to the twistor space. More precisely, our aim is the following:\n\u2022 Wewill give an explicit description of the twistor space of anyQKmanifold obtained via HK/QK correspondence. The description will be in terms of the HK data, which are usually the one that admits a more explicit and simple description. For this, we will make use of certain results and notations from [ACM13]. \u2022 We will then restrict to the case where the QK manifold is a tree-level q-map space (N , gN ) and discuss a distinguished set of holomorphic Darboux coordinates for \u03bb, originally found in [NPV07] via projective superspace arguments. In particular, we wish to discuss why the distinguished Darboux coordinates for \u03bb are actually holomorphic in the complex structure of Z . The reason this is not immediate is because \u03bb is a holomorphic 1-form valued in a holomophic line bundle L\u2192 Z , and when discussing holomorphic Darboux coordinates for \u03bb one must also make sure one is working in a holomorphic trivialization of L\u2192 Z . \u2022 Finally, since the (3n + 6)-dimensional group G from Sect. 3.4 acts by isometries on (N , gN ), it must lift to an action on (Z, I, \u03bb, \u03c4 ) preserving the twistor space structure [NT87]. In other words, the lift must act holomorphically, preserve the contact distribution, and commute with \u03c4 . We end the section by discussing the lift of G. In particular, this includes the explicit lift of S-duality that was described in [APSV09,AP12], together with a lift of the L-action.\n4.1. Review of the twistor space of a QK manifold. Let (N , gN ) by a QK manifold of dimension 4n with n \u2265 2, and let Q \u2192 N denote the associated quaternionic structure, a parallel subbundle Q \u2282 End(T N ) admitting local trivializations (J1, J2, J3) by skew-hermitian endomorphisms satisfying the quaternion relations. The twistor space of (N , gN ) is then defined as the sphere bundle q : Z \u2192 N given by\nZp := {J \u2208 Qp | J 2 = \u22121} , p \u2208 N . (4.1)\nIt is well known (see [Sal82]) that Z \u2192 N carries a canonical complex structure I, holomorphic contact structure \u03bb, and real structure \u03c4 (i.e. an anti-holomorphic involution of (Z, I)) with certain compatibility properties. Furthermore, the fibers q\u22121(p) = Zp \u223c= CP1 are holomorphic submanifolds of (Z, I), transverse to the contact distribution, and having normal bundleO(1)\u22952n . Conversely, by a theorem due to LeBrun [LeB89], from the previous data of (Z, I, \u03bb, \u03c4 ) and q : Z \u2192 N one can invert the twistor construction and recover gN .\nOn the other hand, the bundle of frames of Q \u2192 N determines a principal SO(3)bundle S \u2192 N . It is known that N\u0302 := S \u00d7 R>0 \u2192 N carries a canonical pseudo-HK structure (N\u0302 , g\u0302, I\u03021, I\u03022, I\u03023) known as the Swann bundle or HK cone (see [Swa91] and [ACDM15, Section 1] for a review on the construction). In particular, the SO(3)-action acts by isometries on (N\u0302 , g\u0302), and rotates the complex structures I\u0302\u03b1; while theR>0-action due to the R>0-factor of N\u0302 acts by homotheties on g\u0302. The twistor space of (Z, I, \u03bb, \u03c4 ) of (N , gN ) can be described in terms of (N\u0302 , g\u0302, I\u03021, I\u03022, I\u03023) as follows [Swa91,Hit13]:\n\u2022 By fixing one of the complex structures, say I\u03023, one obtains an SO(2) \u2282 SO(3)action fixing I\u03023, and C\u00d7 = SO(2) \u00d7 R>0 acts holomorphically on (N\u0302 , I\u03023). The quotient (N\u0302 , I\u03023)/C\u00d7 then gives (Z, I), which is independent of the chosen I\u03023. \u2022 If \u03c9\u0302\u03b1 := g\u0302( I\u0302\u03b1\u2212,\u2212) denotes theK\u00e4hler forms of the pseudo-HKmanifold (N\u0302 , g\u0302, I\u03021, I\u03022, I\u03023), then \u0302 := \u03c9\u03021 + i\u03c9\u03022 gives a holomorphic symplectic form for (N\u0302 , I\u03023). If K 1,0 denotes the generator of the previous holomorphic C\u00d7-action, then the complex rank 2n distribution Ker(\u03b9K 1,0\u0302 )/K\n1,0 \u2192 N\u0302 descends to a holomorphic contact distribution D on (Z, I) defining the contact structure \u03bb as a holomorphic one-form with values in a holomorphic line bundle L \u2192 Z . It is given by the canonical projection \u03bb : TZ \u2192 L = TZ/D. \u2022 The real structure \u03c4 descends from the anti-holomorphic action of I\u03021 on (N\u0302 , I\u03023).\n4.2. The HK cone associated to an HKmanifold with rotating circle action. Elaborating onworkofHaydys [Hay08], itwas shown in [ACM13] how to construct a conical pseudoHK manifold N\u0302 of dimension 4n + 4 from a pseudo-HK manifold N of dimension 4n with a rotating circle action. The manifold N\u0302 was called the conification of N . In the following we will mostly drop the prefix \u2018pseudo\u2019 for simplicity.\nWe start by describing the HK cone (N\u0302 , gN\u0302 , \u03c9\u0302\u03b1) associated to an HK manifold (N , gN , \u03c9\u03b1) with rotating circle action as explicitly as possible, following [ACM13]. If (N , gN , Q) denotes the QK manifold obtained from (N , gN , \u03c9\u03b1) via HK/QK correspondence, then the HK cone associated to the HK manifold coincides with the HK cone associated to the QK manifold, described in the previous section [ACDM15]. We will then use this to describe the twistor space of the QK manifold in terms of the HK manifold with rotating action.\nLet us recall what the initial HK data for the HK/QK correspondence is: \u2022 We require a pseudo-HK manifold (N , gN , \u03c9\u03b1) together with a vector field V on N satisfying:\nLV\u03c91 = \u22122\u03c92, LV\u03c92 = 2\u03c91, LV\u03c93 = 0 . (4.2) We assume that V is time-like or space-like, and that f : N \u2192 R is a non-vanishing Hamiltonian for V , with respect to \u03c93:\nd f = \u2212\u03b9V\u03c93 . (4.3)\nWe furthermore define\nf3 := f \u2212 gN (V, V ) 2 , (4.4)\nand assume f3 is non-vanishing on N 3. \u2022 We also need an S1-principal bundle \u03c0 : P \u2192 N with connection \u03b7, such that\nd\u03b7 = \u03c0\u2217(\u03c93 \u2212 1 2 d(\u03b9V gN )). (4.5)\nSuch a bundle turns out to be hyperholomorphic, in the sence that the curvature \u03c0\u2217F = d\u03b7 satisfies that F is of type (1, 1) with respect to I\u03b1 for \u03b1 = 1, 2, 3 (see for example [Hit13]).\nWith this data, we construct the HK cone (N\u0302 , gN\u0302 , \u03c9\u0302\u03b1) as follows. We will use the notations and construction of [ACM13].\nLetting V\u0303 denote the horizontal lift of V to P with respect to \u03b7, and XP the fundamental vector field of P , we define\nV3 := V\u0303 + f3XP , (4.6) and the one forms on P (below we identify tensor fields on N with their pullbacks to P)\n\u03b8 P3 := \u03b7 + 1\n2 \u03b9V gN , \u03b8\nP 1 :=\n1 2 \u03b9V\u03c92, \u03b8 P 2 := \u2212 1 2 \u03b9V\u03c91 . (4.7)\nNotice that\nd\u03b8 P\u03b1 = \u03c0\u2217\u03c9\u03b1, LV3\u03b7 = 0 , LV3\u03b8 P3 = 0, LV3\u03b8 P1 = \u22122\u03b8 P2 , LV3\u03b8 P2 = 2\u03b8 P1 . (4.8)\nLetting \u03b8\u03b1 := f \u22121\u03b8 P\u03b1 and (i\u03b1) = (i, j, k) for \u03b1 = 1, 2, 3 denote the canonical generators of the imaginary quaternions Im(H) \u2282 H; we consider the 1-form \u03b8 \u2208 1(P, Im(H)) given by\n\u03b8 := 3\u2211\n\u03b1=1 \u03b8\u03b1i\u03b1 . (4.9)\nNow let \u03d5 be the right-invariant Maurer-Cartan form on H\u00d7 := H\u2212 {0}, so that for q \u2208 H\u00d7 we can write \u03d5 = dq \u00b7 q\u22121 = \u03d50 +\u22113\u03b1=1 \u03d5\u03b1i\u03b1 . If e0, e1, e2, e3 denote the right invariant vector fields of H\u00d7 coinciding with the canonical basis at q = 1, we then have\n\u03d5a(eb) = \u03b4ab, a, b = 0, 1, 2, 3. (4.10) We furthermore denote\nAdq : H\u2192 H, Adq(x) = qxq\u22121 . (4.11) 3 The subscript for f3 is only to remember that it is built from a Hamiltonian of V with respect to \u03c93.\nLetting N\u0303 := H\u00d7 \u00d7 P , we can extend \u03b8 to \u03b8\u0303 \u2208 1(N\u0303 , H) by setting\n\u03b8\u0303 = \u03b8\u03030 + 3\u2211\n\u03b1=1 \u03b8\u0303\u03b1i\u03b1 := \u03d5 + Ad(\u03b8) . (4.12)\nFurthermore, let \u03c9\u0303\u03b1 \u2208 2(N\u0303 ) be given by \u03c9\u0303\u03b1 := d(|q|2 f \u03b8\u0303\u03b1) , (4.13)\nand let eL3 denote the left-invariant vector field onH \u00d7 which coincides with the canonical basis vector e3 at q = 1. Let V L3 := eL3 \u2212 V3 \u2208 (N\u0303 , T N\u0303 ) and consider N\u0302 the space of integral curves of V L3 together with the projection \u03c0\u0303 : N\u0303 \u2192 N\u0302 . We assume that N\u0302 is a Hausdorff manifold. We then have:\nTheorem 4.1 [ACM13, Theorem 2]. There is a pseudo-HK structure (g\u0302, I\u0302\u03b1) on N\u0302 with exact K\u00e4hler forms \u03c9\u0302\u03b1 \u2208 2(N\u0302 ) such that\n\u03c0\u0303\u2217\u03c9\u0302\u03b1 = \u03c9\u0303\u03b1 . (4.14) Furthermore, the position vector field \u03beH on H\u00d7 \u2282 H, \u03beH(q) = q, projects to a vector field \u03be such that (N\u0302 , g\u0302, \u03c9\u0302\u03b1, \u03be) is a conicalHK-manifold. In particular, the right-invariant vector fields e\u03b1 for \u03b1 = 1, 2, 3 descend to Killing vector fields J\u0302\u03b1\u03be , generating a faithful SO(3)-action on the three-dimensional space spanned by the two-forms \u03c9\u0302\u03b1 .\nAn explicit form for \u03c9\u0303\u03b1 in terms of the HK data is given by [ACM13, Lemma 3]:\n\u03c9\u0303\u03b1 = 2|q|2 f ( \u03d50 \u2227 \u03d5\u03b1 + \u03d5\u03b2 \u2227 \u03d5\u03b3 + \u03d50 \u2227 (Adq\u03b8)\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b80 \u2227 \u03d5\u03b1\n+\u03d5\u03b2 \u2227 (Adq\u03b8)\u03b3 \u2212 \u03d5\u03b3 \u2227 (Adq\u03b8)\u03b2 ) + |q|2(Adq\u03c9)\u03b1 , (4.15)\nwhere (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 ) are in positive cyclic order.\n4.2.1. The c-map case It is well known that QK manifolds in the image of the 1-loop corrected c-map can be obtained by applying the HK/QK correspondence to a HK manifold obtained via the rigid c-map [ACDM15]. More precisely, if M is a CASK domain and M is the associated PSK manifold, then the QK manifold obtained by applying the 1-loop corrected c-map to M can also be obtained by applying the rigid c-map to M , and then the HK/QK correspondence, with the 1-loop parameter corresponding to a choice of Hamiltonian f for the rotating vector field [ACDM15].\nIn this subsection we wish to recall the description of the HK-manifold associated to a 1-loop corrected c-map space via HK/QK correspondence, and furthermore describe the HK cone data associated to it. This will be used later when we describe the Darboux coordinates for the contact structure of the QK twistor space. We will mostly use the formulas from [CT22], with the corresponding instanton corrections set to 0 (i.e. setting all BPS indices (\u03b3 ) = 0 for all charges \u03b3 ).\nLet (M,F)be aCASKdomainof signature (2, 2n) (notice that this is, as in [CT22], the opposite4 signature fromDefinition 2.4) and (N , gN , \u03c9\u03b1) the associatedHKmanifold (of signature (4, 4n)) via the rigid c-map. Let Zi for i = 0, . . . , n be the natural holomorphic\n4 To obtain the signature convention of Definition 2.4 it suffices to replace the holomorphic prepotential F by \u2212F.\ncoordinates on the CASK domain M \u2282 Cn+1, and let Zi := \u2202F/\u2202Zi and \u03c4i j := \u22022F/\u2202Zi\u2202Z j . In the following, if v,w \u2208 R2n+2 where v = (vi , vi ), w = (wi , wi ) and i = 0, 1 . . . , n; then we denote by \u3008\u2212,\u2212\u3009 the symplectic pairing\n\u3008v,w\u3009 = viwi \u2212 viwi . (4.16) By combining (4.16) with the wedge product, we can describe the HKmanifold (N , gN , \u03c9\u03b1) explicitly by [CT22, Section 2.4]:\n\u03c91 + i\u03c92 = \u2212\u3008dZ \u2227 d\u03b6 \u3009, \u03c93 = \u03c0 2 \u3008dZ \u2227 dZ\u3009 \u2212 1 4\u03c0 \u3008d\u03b6 \u2227 d\u03b6 \u3009 , (4.17)\nwhere \u03b6 = (\u0303\u03b6i , \u03b6 i ) and Z = (Zi , Zi ); while the metric gN is given by\ngN = 2\u03c0(Im(\u03c4 ))i j d Zid Z j + 1 2\u03c0 (Im(\u03c4 ))i j W\u0303i W\u0303 j , W\u0303i := d \u03b6\u0303i \u2212 \u03c4i j d\u03b6 j , (4.18)\nwhere gM = (Im(\u03c4 ))i j d Zid Z j is the conical affine special K\u00e4hler metric. We remark that W\u0303i differs from Wi defined below (2.11) just in the convention of the signature of the CASKmetric defined by \u03c4i j (i.e. with respect to (M,F) of signature (2, 2n) we have Wi = d \u03b6\u0303i \u2212 (\u2212\u03c4i j )d\u03b6 j ). The rotating vector field V is given by\nV = 2 ( i Z i\u2202Zi \u2212 i Z i\u2202Zi ) , (4.19)\nwhile if we denote by \u03be the Euler vector field of the CASK manifold, and r :=\u221a gM (\u03be, \u03be), then\nf = 2\u03c0r2 \u2212 c, f3 = \u22122\u03c0r2 \u2212 c, for c \u2208 R. (4.20) On the other hand, the hyperholomorphic circle bundle (P, \u03b7) associated to (N , gN ,\n\u03c9\u03b1, V, f ) is given by P = N \u00d7 S1 with connection [CT22, Section 4]\n\u03b7 = d\u03c3 \u2212 1 4\u03c0 \u3008\u03b6 \u2227 d\u03b6 \u3009 + i\u03c0 2 (\u2202r2 \u2212 \u2202r2)\u2212 1 2 \u03b9V gN\n= d\u03c3 \u2212 1 4\u03c0 \u3008\u03b6 \u2227 d\u03b6 \u3009 \u2212 \u03c0r2\u03b7\u0303\n(4.21)\nwhere we have set \u03b7\u0303 := 1 r2\n\u03b9J\u03be gM (note that in the present conventions V denotes the \u2207-horizontal lift of 2J\u03be , not the horizontal lift of J\u03be as in [CT22]).\nTheQKmetricweobtain by doingHK/QKcorrespodence to theHKdata (N , gN , \u03c9\u03b1, V, f ) with the hyperholomorphic bundle (P, \u03b7) and taking\nN := {(Zi , \u03b6 i , \u03b6\u0303i , \u03c3 ) \u2208 P | Arg(Z0) = 0} (4.22) is given by [CT22, Equation 5.8]:\ngN = \u03c1 + c\n\u03c1 gM +\n\u03c1 + 2c\n4(\u03c1 + c)\u03c12 d\u03c12 +\n4(\u03c1 + c)\n\u03c12(\u03c1 + 2c)\n( d\u03c3 \u2212 1\n4\u03c0 \u3008\u03b6, d\u03b6 \u3009 \u2212 c 4 dcK\u0303\n)2\n\u2212 1 2\u03c0\u03c1\nW\u0303i ( N\u0303 i j \u2212 2(\u03c1 + c)\n\u03c1 K\u0303 zi z j\n) W\u0303 j (4.23)\nwhere \u03c1 = f ; zi := Zi/Z0 and N\u0303i j = Im(\u03c4i j ), K\u0303 = N\u0303i j zi z j , K\u0303 = \u2212 log(K\u0303 ). In particular, if we perform the rescaling\n\u03c1 \u2192 4 \u03c0 \u03c1, \u03c3 \u2192 \u03c3 4\u03c0 , c\u2192 4 \u03c0 c , \u03b6 i \u2192\u2212\u03b6 i (4.24)\nwe can write\ngN = \u03c1 + c\n\u03c1 gM +\n\u03c1 + 2c\n4(\u03c1 + c)\u03c12 d\u03c12 +\n(\u03c1 + c)\n64\u03c12(\u03c1 + 2c)\n( d\u03c3 + \u3008\u03b6, d\u03b6 \u3009 \u2212 4cdcK )2\n\u2212 1 4\u03c1\nWi ( Ni j \u2212 2(\u03c1 + c)\n\u03c1K zi z j\n) W j , (4.25)\nmatching (2.11). Here we have used that N\u0303i j = Im(\u03c4i j ) = Im(\u22022i jF) = 12 (\u22122Im (\u22022i j (\u2212F))) = 12Ni j , taking into account that\u2212F is the prepotential for which the signature of (Im(\u22022i j (\u2212F))) is (2n, 2). Furthermore, setting c = 0 we obtain\ngN = gM + d\u03c12\n4\u03c12 +\n1\n64\u03c12\n( d\u03c3 + \u3008\u03b6, d\u03b6 \u3009 )2 \u2212 1 4\u03c1 Wi ( Ni j \u2212 2 K zi z j ) W j = g0FS ,\n(4.26)\nmatching (2.12).\n4.3. The QK twistor space in terms of the HK cone. Let (N , gN , Q) be the QK space obtained by applying the HK/QK correspondence to the data (N , gN , \u03c9\u03b1, V, f ) and the hyperholomorphic line bundle (\u03c0 : P \u2192 N , \u03b7) (see [ACDM15, Theorem 2]). In this section, we use the description of the twistor space of (N , gN , Q) in terms of the HK cone given in Sect. 4.1, together with the description of the HK cone in terms of the HK data (N , gN , \u03c9\u03b1, V, f ) and (\u03c0 : P \u2192 N , \u03b7) from Sect. 4.2, in order to obtain a description of the twistor space in terms of the HK data.\n\u2022 The complex manifold (Z, I): Let (N\u0302 , gN\u0302 , \u03c9\u0302\u03b1) be the HK cone associated to the data (N , gN , \u03c9\u03b1, V, f ), and (\u03c0 : P \u2192 N , \u03b7). Furthermore, consider the previous auxiliary space N\u0303 = H\u00d7\u00d7P fromSect. 4.2, togetherwith the projection \u03c0\u0303 : N\u0303 \u2192 N\u0302 . Let q0 + q1i + q2 j + q3k \u2208 H\u00d7, and consider the complex coordinates z = q0 + iq3 andw = q1 + iq2 onH\u00d7 \u223c= C2 \\{0}. Recall that on N\u0303 we have the commuting actions generated by the vector fields V L3 and e3. With respect to the complex coordinates (z, w) we can write:\nV L3 = eL3 \u2212 V3 = i z\u2202z \u2212 i z\u2202z \u2212 iw\u2202w + iw\u2202w \u2212 V3, e3 = i z\u2202z \u2212 i z\u2202z + iw\u2202w \u2212 iw\u2202w . (4.27)\nFor future reference, we note that eL3 generates an S 1-action on H\u00d7 given by\n\u03bb \u00b7 (z, w)\u2192 (\u03bbz, \u03bbw) , (4.28) while e3 generates the S1-action given by\n\u03bb \u00b7 (z, w)\u2192 (\u03bbz, \u03bbw) . (4.29)\nSince [V L3 , e3] = 0, we have that e3 descends to a vector field K on N\u0302 , and by [ACM13, Theorem 2] we have K = I\u03023\u03be and\nLK I\u03023 = 0, LK I\u03021 = \u22122 I\u03022, LK I\u03022 = 2 I\u03021 . (4.30) Furthermore, the S1-action on N\u0303 admits a natural extension to aC\u00d7-action, and descends to the quotient N\u0302 . It is easy to check that theC\u00d7-action on N\u0303 is generated by 12 (e3 + ie0). From the fact that a vector field of type (1, 0) with respect to a complex structure J is holomorphic if any only if its real part preserves J we obtain the following lemma.\nLemma 4.2. The vector field\nK 1,0 := 1 2 (K \u2212 i I\u03023K ) (4.31)\non N\u0302 is I\u03023-holomorphic. Furthermore, it generates an I\u03023-holomorphic C\u00d7-action on N\u0302 , descending from the C\u00d7-action generated by 12 (e3 + ie0) on N\u0303 .\nThe twistor space Z of N , together with its holomorphic structure is then obtained by the holomorphic quotient (see for example [Hit13, Section 4]):\n(Z, I) := (N\u0302 , I\u03023)/C\u00d7K 1,0 . (4.32) Even more, the function \u03bc = g\u0302(\u03be, \u03be)/2 gives a moment map for the U(1)-action generated by K , so (Z, I) has a (pseudo)-K\u00e4hler structure (gZ , I), induced from the K\u00e4hler quotient\n(Z, I, gZ ) = (N\u0302 , I\u03023, g\u0302)//U(1)K . (4.33) \u2022 The holomorphic contact structure \u03bb: we consider the holomorphic symplectic form on N\u0302 in complex structure I\u03023 given by\n\u0302 := \u03c9\u03021 + i\u03c9\u03022 . (4.34) To describe this holomorphic symplectic form as explicitly as possible, we consider as before the complex coordinates z and w on the H\u00d7 factor of N\u0303 . We then have by (4.13) and (4.14) that \u03bb\u0303 \u2208 1(N\u0303 , C) defined by\n\u03bb\u0303 := |q|2 f (\u03b8\u03031 + i \u03b8\u03032) (4.35) satisfies\nd\u03bb\u0303 = \u0303 = \u03c9\u03031 + i\u03c9\u03032 = \u03c0\u0303\u2217\u0302 . (4.36) In terms of the coordinates z and w on the H\u00d7-factor of N\u0303 , it follows from a straightforward computation using (4.12) that \u03bb\u0303 can be written as\n\u03bb\u0303 = f (zdw \u2212 wdz + (z2 + w2)\u03b81 + i(z2 \u2212 w2)\u03b82 \u2212 2i zw\u03b83) = f (zdw \u2212 wdz + z2\u03b8+ + w2\u03b8\u2212 \u2212 2i zw\u03b83)\n(4.37)\nwhere \u03b8\u00b1 := \u03b81 \u00b1 i\u03b82. Using that\nV L3 = i z\u2202z \u2212 i z\u2202z \u2212 iw\u2202w + iw\u2202w \u2212 V\u0303 \u2212 f3XP , (4.38)\none can easily check that\n\u03b9V L3 \u03bb\u0303 = f (\u22122i zw \u2212 2i zw\u03b83(\u2212V3)) = 0\nLV L3 \u03bb\u0303 = f ( LV L3 (zdw \u2212 wdz) + LV L3 (z 2\u03b8+) + LV L3 (w 2\u03b8\u2212) + LV L3 (\u22122i zw\u03b83) ) = 0 (4.39)\nwhere we used that \u03b83(V3) = 1 and (compare with equation (4.8)) LV L3 z 2 = 2i z2, LV L3 w 2 = \u22122iw2, LV L3 \u03b8+ = \u22122i\u03b8+,\nLV L3 \u03b8\u2212 = 2i\u03b8\u2212, LV L3 \u03b83 = 0 . (4.40)\nWe conclude that \u03bb\u0303 descends to a 1-form \u03bb\u0302 \u2208 1(N\u0302 , C) such that \u03c0\u0303\u2217\u03bb\u0302 = \u03bb\u0303, d\u03bb\u0302 = \u0302 . (4.41)\nLemma 4.3. The complex 1-form \u03bb\u0302 is I\u03023-holomorphic. Furthermore, if Rx denotes the action by x \u2208 C\u00d7 under the holomorphic C\u00d7-action on N\u0302 generated by K 1,0, we also have\nR\u2217x \u03bb\u0302 = x2\u03bb\u0302 . (4.42) Proof. Toshow this,we recall fromLemma4.2 that the vectorfield K 1,0 is I\u03023-holomorphic, and that e3 projects to K . In particular, we conclude that \u03b9K 1,0\u0302 is a holomorphic 1-form in complex structure I\u03023 and\n\u03c0\u0303\u2217\u03b9K 1,0\u0302 = \u03c0\u0303\u2217\u03b9K \u0302 = \u03b9e3\u0303 . (4.43) On the other hand, using (4.36), (4.37) and (4.27), we find that\n\u03b9e3\u0303 = Le3 \u03bb\u0303\u2212 d(\u03b9e3 \u03bb\u0303) = 2i \u03bb\u0303 = 2i \u03c0\u0303\u2217\u03bb\u0302 . (4.44) It then follows that\n\u03b9K 1,0\u0302 = 2i \u03bb\u0302 (4.45) and hence that \u03bb\u0302 is holomorphic in complex structure I\u03023.\nOn the other hand, recall that 12 (e3 + ie0) generates a C \u00d7 -action on the H\u00d7-factor of\nN\u0303 acting by\n(z, w)\u2192 (xz, xw) . (4.46) Using (4.37), we then find\nR\u2217x \u03bb\u0303 = x 2\u0303\u03bb . (4.47) Finally, since Rx descends to N\u0302 , Rx and \u03c0\u0303 commute, so that\n\u03c0\u0303\u2217R\u2217x \u03bb\u0302 = R\u2217x \u03bb\u0303 = \u03c0\u0303\u2217(x2\u03bb\u0302) \u21d2 R\u2217x \u03bb\u0302 = x2\u03bb\u0302 . (4.48)\nProposition 4.4. Consider the holomorphic line bundle\nL := N\u0302 \u00d7C\u00d7 C\u2192 Z (4.49)\nassociated to the action x \u00b7 z = x2z of C\u00d7 on C. Then \u03bb\u0302 descends to a holomorphic section of T \u2217Z\u2297L\u2192 Z (i.e a holomorphic 1-form onZ with values inL), and\u03bb defines a holomorphic contact distribution on Z matching the canonical contact structure of the twistor space.\nProof. Notice that\n\u03c0\u0303\u2217\u03b9K 1,0 \u03bb\u0302 = \u03c0\u0303\u2217\u03b9K \u03bb\u0302 = \u03b9e3 \u03bb\u0303 = \u03b9e3 \u03b9e3(\u0303 /2i) = 0 \u21d2 \u03b9K 1,0 \u03bb\u0302 = 0 . (4.50)\nso that \u03bb\u0302 is vertical with respect to N\u0302 \u2192 Z . By the transformation rule of \u03bb\u0302 under the C \u00d7-action from Lemma 4.3, we conclude that \u03bb\u0302 descends to a holomorphic 1-form on Z with values in L. To see that \u03bb defines a holomorphic contact structure on Z , we note that if 2n = dimC(N ), then\n\u03bb\u0302 \u2227 d\u03bb\u0302n = 1 (2i)n+1 \u03b9K 1,0\u0302 \u2227 (LK 1,0\u0302 )n = in (2i)n+1 \u03b9K 1,0\u0302 n+1 . (4.51)\nSince K 1,0 generates theC\u00d7-action fromabove, and (\u0302 )n+1 gives a holomorphic volume form on N\u0302 , it follows that \u03bb\u0302 \u2227 d\u03bb\u0302n descends to a non-degenerate holomorphic form on Z , valued in L\u2297(n+1). It then follows that \u03bb defines a holomorphic contact structure on Z . The fact that it matches the canonical contact structure on the twistor space follows from the remarks at the end of Sect. 4.1. Remark 4.5. From the previous proof it follows that if K\u2192 Z is the canonical bundle of Z , andK\u2217 the dual bundle, then L \u223c= (K\u2217)1/(n+1) (i.e. L is an (n + 1)-root ofK\u2217 with respect to the tensor product of bundles).\nFor future reference, we remark that smooth sections of L \u2192 Z can be identified with smooth functions N\u0302 \u2192 C homogeneous of degree 2 with respect to the action generated by K . In turn, such functions can be identified with functions N\u0303 \u2192 C which are homogeneous of degree 2 with respect to the action of e3, and invariant under the action of V L3 . A particular example of this is given by the function zw : N\u0303 \u2192 C, which then defines a smooth section of L \u2192 Z . Latter we will see that this section is holomorphic.\n\u2022 The real structure \u03c4 : via the identification\n(Z, I) := (N\u0302 , I\u03023)/C\u00d7K 1,0 . (4.52)\nthe real structure \u03c4 on (Z, I)descends from the anti-holomorphicmap I\u03021 : (N\u0302 , I\u03023)\u2192 (N\u0302 , I\u03023). The fact that it descends to an involution comes from the fact that I\u0302 21 = \u22121 acts as the identity on the quotient by the C\u00d7-action.\n4.3.1. Local expressions of the contact structure In the following, we set t := w/z. From (4.37), we can then write the following expression for \u03bb\u0303 \u2208 1(N\u0303 , C):\n\u03bb\u0303 = f (dt t + t\u22121\u03b8+ \u2212 2i\u03b83 + t\u03b8\u2212 ) \u00b7 zw . (4.53)\nEach of the two factors in the above expression is invariant under the V L3 -action. In particular, zw descends to a function [zw] on N\u0302 , homogeneous of degree two with respect to the K 1,0-action, while\nf (dt t + t\u22121\u03b8+ \u2212 2i\u03b83 + t\u03b8\u2212 ) (4.54)\ndescends to a 1-form \u03bb\u03020 on N\u0302 , invariant under the K 1,0-action. We can then locally write\n\u03bb\u0302 = \u03bb\u03020 \u00b7 [zw] . (4.55) Furthermore, since \u03bb\u03020 is invariant under the K 1,0-action, it descends to a 1-form \u03bb0 on the twistor space Z , while [zw] gives a section s of L\u2192 Z , being a function on N\u0302 homogeneous of degree 2 with respect to the K 1,0-action.\nWe can therefore locally write\n\u03bb = \u03bb0 \u00b7 s . (4.56) To describe \u03bb0 in local coordinates, it is enough to identify N\u0302 with a submanifold of N\u0303 transverse to V L3 , and pick local coordinates for the transverse submanifold. In particular, if we pick coordinates of the form (z, w, xa) then we have\n\u03bb0 = f (dt t + t\u22121\u03b8+|N\u0302 \u2212 2i\u03b83|N\u0302 + t\u03b8\u2212|N\u0302 )\n= f dt t + t\u22121\u03b8 P+ |N\u0302 \u2212 2i\u03b8 P3 |N\u0302 + t\u03b8 P\u2212 |N\u0302 ,\n(4.57)\nwhere the restrictions \u03b8\u03b1|N\u0302 and \u03b8 P\u03b1 |N\u0302 = f \u03b8\u03b1|N\u0302 only depend on the xa-coordinates. We finish this section with the following useful lemma, which will be used to prove that Darboux coordinates for \u03bb to be discussed in the next section, are actually holomorphic coordinates on the twistor space.\nLemma 4.6. The section s of L\u2192 Z is holomorphic. In particular, since \u03bb is a holomorphic section of T \u2217Z \u2297 L\u2192 Z , the 1-form \u03bb0 on Z must also be holomorphic. Proof. We use the notation from [ACM13, Section 2]. In particular, we consider the real codimension 1-distribution D \u2295 E of T N\u0303 and the endomorphisms I\u0303\u03b1 of D \u2295 E \u2192 N\u0303 used to describe the complex structures I\u0302\u03b1 on N\u0302 . More specifically:\nD = span{e0, e\u03b1, V\u0303 , I\u0303\u03b1V }, E = (span{V\u0303 , I\u0303\u03b1V })\u22a5 \u2282 T h P . (4.58) where \u22a5 inside T h P is taken with respect to the metric of P given by\ngP = 2 f3 \u03b72 + \u03c0\u2217gN , (4.59)\nand W\u0303 denotes the horizonal lift of a vector field with respect to \u03b7. Showing that s is holomorphic is equivalent to showing that [zw] is an I\u03023-holomorphic function on N\u0302 , which in turn reduces to checking that\nI\u0303 \u22173 d(zw) = id(zw)|D\u2295E . (4.60) We consider the frame (e0, e\u03b1, W\u03030, W\u0303 \u2032\u03b1, Ei ) as in [ACM13], where Ei is a frame for E and (e0, e\u03b1, W\u03030, W\u0303 \u2032\u03b1) a global frame for D. In [ACM13] it is shown that I\u0303\u03b1 splits as\nI\u0303\u03b1 = I\u0303\u03b1|span{e0,e\u03b1} \u2295 I\u0303\u03b1|span{W\u03030,W\u0303 \u2032\u03b1} \u2295 I\u0303\u03b1|E (4.61)\nIn particular, since d(zw) vanishes when evaluated on (W\u03030, W\u0303 \u2032\u03b1, Ei ), it is enough to check that\n( I\u0303 \u22173 d(zw))(ea) = id(zw)(ea), a = 0, 1, 2, 3 . (4.62) This follows from the fact that\nI\u03033(e0) = e3, I\u03033(e3) = \u2212e0, I\u03033(e1) = e2, I\u03033(e2) = \u2212e1 . (4.63) together with the identities\nd(zw)(e0) = 2zw, d(zw)(e3) = 2i zw, d(zw)(e1) = |z|2 \u2212 |w|2, d(zw)(e2) = i(|z|2 \u2212 |w|2). (4.64)\nIt then follows that [zw] is a I\u03023-holomorphic function on N\u0302 , and hence that s is a holomorphic section of L\u2192 Z .\n4.3.2. Darboux coordinates for the case of tree-level q-map spaces We now wish to focus on the tree level q-map case, and describe \u03bb0 in the natural variables appearing in the context of c-map metrics. We will also discuss certain Darboux coordinates for \u03bb, first found in [NPV07]. Our previous arguments (i.e. Proposition 4.4 and Lemma 4.6) will allow us to show that they are actually holomorphic coordinates on (Z, I).\nIn the following, we identify N\u0302 with the following submanifold of N\u0303 , transverse to V L3 :\nN\u0302 := {(Zi , \u03b6 i , \u03b6\u0303i , \u03c3, q) \u2208 N\u0303 | Arg(Z0) = 0} \u223c= N \u00d7H\u00d7 \u2282 N\u0303 , (4.65) which then has coordinates (\u03c1, za, \u03b6 i , \u03b6\u0303i , \u03c3, z, w), where f = \u03c1 = 2\u03c0r2 and za := Za/Z0.\nIn this case, by Sects. 4.2.1 and (4.7) one finds that the 1-forms \u03b8\u03b1 on P satisfy:\n\u03b8+ = \u2212 1 f \u3008Z , d\u03b6 \u3009, \u03b8\u2212 = \u2212 1 f \u3008Z , d\u03b6 \u3009, \u03b83 = d\u03c3 f \u2212 1 4\u03c0 f \u3008\u03b6, d\u03b6 \u3009 + 1 2 \u03b7\u0303 . (4.66)\nThere formulas correspond to the conventions at the beginning of Sect. 4.2.1, where F produces aCASKmanifold of signature (2, 2n). In order to relate back to the conventions of Sects. 2 and 3, corresponding to theQKmetric (2.12), we perform the rescalings (4.24) from Sect. 4.2.1\n\u03c1 \u2192 4 \u03c0 \u03c1, \u03c3 \u2192 \u03c3 4\u03c0 , \u03b6 i \u2192\u2212\u03b6 i (4.67)\nand write everything in terms of the prepotential\u2212F producing a CASKmanifold of signature (2n, 2) (in particular, we redefine Zi = \u2202ZiF and \u03c4i j = \u2202Zi \u2202Z jF from Sect. 4.2.1 by Zi := \u2202Zi (\u2212F) and \u03c4i j := \u2202Zi \u2202Z j (\u2212F)), obtaining\n\u03b8+ = \u2212 \u03c0 4 f \u3008Z \u2227 d\u03b6 \u3009, \u03b8\u2212 = \u2212 \u03c0 4 f \u3008Z \u2227 d\u03b6 \u3009, \u03b83 = d\u03c3 16 f + 1 16 f \u3008\u03b6, d\u03b6 \u3009 + 1 2 \u03b7\u0303 .\n(4.68)\nAs we saw in Sect. 4.2.1, the rescalings (4.67) take the QKmetric (4.23) obtained via HK/QK correspondence to (2.12). In particular, after the scaling we have the relation \u03c1 = \u03c4 222 h(t) = \u03c4 22 16e \u2212K corresponding to theMirror map. On the other hand, we now have 4 \u03c0 \u03c1 = 2\u03c0r2 which implies \u03c1 = \u03c024 |Z0|2e\u2212K (here we have used that r2 = |Z0|2e\u2212K\u0303 = |Z0|2 2 e \u2212K), so we find the relation\n\u03c4 22\n16 e\u2212K = \u03c0\n2\n4 |Z0|2e\u2212K \u21d2 2\u03c0 |Z0| = \u03c42. (4.69)\nRecall the definition of the vector Z = (Z0, . . . , Zn, Z0, . . . , Zn), Zi = \u2212\u2202ZiF(Z0, . . . , Zn).Hence in termsof the normalized central charges Z\u0303 := Z/Z0 = (zi , Fi ),where zi := Zi/Z0 (in particular, z0 = 1) and Fi := Fi (z0, . . . , zn) = Fi (Z0, . . . , Zn) = \u2212\u2202ZiF(Z0, . . . , Zn)/Z0 are homogeneous of degree zero; andusing that \u03b7\u0303|N\u0302 = \u2212 12dcK, we can write\n\u03b8+|N\u0302 = \u2212 \u03c42 8 f \u3008Z\u0303 , d\u03b6 \u3009, \u03b8\u2212|N\u0302 = \u03b8+|N\u0302\n\u03b83|N\u0302 = d\u03c3\n16 f +\n1 16 f \u3008\u03b6, d\u03b6 \u3009 \u2212 1 4 dcK ,\n(4.70)\nand hence,\n\u03bb0 = f (dt t \u2212 \u03c42 8 f t \u3008Z\u0303 , d\u03b6 \u3009 \u2212 t \u03c42 8 f \u3008Z\u0303 , d\u03b6 \u3009 \u2212 2i ( d\u03c3 16 f + 1 16 f \u3008\u03b6, d\u03b6 \u3009 \u2212 1 4 dcK )) .\n(4.71)\nThe claim, following [NPV07], is that one can obtainDarboux coordinates as follows:\nProposition 4.7. Let \u03bb \u2208 1(Z,L) be the holomorphic 1-form valued inL, defining the holomorphic contact structure of (Z, I). Then on the open subset Z0 := N \u00d7 (CP1 \u2212 {0,\u221e}) \u2282 Z \u223c= N \u00d7 CP1, we can write\n\u03bb = 1 8i (d\u03b1 + \u3008\u03be, d\u03be \u3009) \u00b7 s = 1 8i (d\u03b1 + \u03be\u0303i d\u03be i \u2212 \u03be i d \u03be\u0303i ) \u00b7 s , (4.72)\nwhere\n\u03be i = \u03b6 i \u2212 i\u03c42 2 (t\u22121zi + t zi ) \u03be\u0303i = \u03b6\u0303i \u2212 i\u03c42 2 (t\u22121Fi + t Fi )\n\u03b1 = \u03c3 \u2212 i\u03c42 2 (t\u22121\u3008Z\u0303 , \u03b6 \u3009 + t\u3008Z\u0303 , \u03b6 \u3009)\n(4.73)\nand s is the holomorphic section ofL\u2192 Z given in Lemma 4.6. In particular, (\u03be i , \u03be\u0303i , \u03b1) are holomorphic coordinates on (Z, I). Proof.

(4.79)\nBy Proposition 4.4 and Lemma 4.6 we know that \u03bb is a holomorphic section of T \u2217Z \u2297 L\u2192 Z and s is a holomorphic section of L. Hence,\n\u03bb0 = 1 8i (d\u03b1 + \u03be\u0303i d\u03be i \u2212 \u03be i d \u03be\u0303i ) (4.80)\nis a holomorphic 1-form on the twistor space. Now consider the (0, 1) vector\n\u2202\u0303\u03bei + iI \u2202\u0303\u03bei (4.81) and the (2, 0) form\nd(d\u03b1 + \u03be\u0303i d\u03be i \u2212 \u03be i d \u03be\u0303i ) = 2d \u03be\u0303i \u2227 d\u03be i . (4.82)\nWe then have\n0 = d \u03be\u0303i \u2227 d\u03be i (\u2202\u0303\u03bei + iI \u2202\u0303\u03bei ) = d\u03be i + iI\u2217d\u03be i \u21d2 I\u2217d\u03be i = id\u03be i . (4.83) so that \u03be i is holomorphic. Similarly, we find that \u03be\u0303i is holomorphic. Finally, since \u03be i and \u03be\u0303i are holomorphic, and \u03bb0 is (1, 0), we conclude that \u03b1 is also holomorphic. 4.3.3. Darboux coordinates for the case of 1-loop corrected q-map spaces Once we have figured the Darboux coordinates for the tree-level q-map case, we don\u2019t have to do much work to obtain the case with 1-loop corrections. Indeed, in terms of the HK data (N , gN , \u03c9\u03b1, f, V ) and (P, \u03b7) of the HK/QK correspondence from Sect. 4.2.1, the 1-loop parameter c \u2208 R appears only in f via\nf = 2\u03c0r2 \u2212 c . (4.84) We can therefore write the local expression for the contact form \u03bb in (4.57) as\n\u03bb = \u03bbcl \u2212 cdt t \u00b7 s , (4.85)\nwhere \u03bbcl is the contact form for the tree-level case from before. We therefore obtain the following corollary from Proposition 4.7.\nCorollary 4.8. Let \u03bb \u2208 1(Z,L) be the holomorphic 1-form valued in L, defining the holomorphic contact structure of (Z, I). Then on the open subset Z0 := N \u00d7 (C \u2212 R\u22640) \u2282 Z \u223c= N \u00d7 CP1, we can write\n\u03bb = 1 8i (d\u03b1 + \u03be\u0303i d\u03be i \u2212 \u03be i d \u03be\u0303i ) \u00b7 s , (4.86)\nwhere\n\u03be i = \u03b6 i \u2212 i\u03c42 2 (t\u22121zi + t zi ) \u03be\u0303i = \u03b6\u0303i \u2212 i\u03c42 2 (t\u22121Fi + t Fi )\n\u03b1 = \u03c3 \u2212 i\u03c42 2 (t\u22121\u3008Z\u0303 , \u03b6 \u3009 + t\u3008Z\u0303 , \u03b6 \u3009)\u2212 8ic log(t) ,\n(4.87)\nlog(t) uses the principal branch, and s is the holomorphic section of L\u2192 Z given in Lemma 4.6. Furthermore, (\u03be i , \u03be\u0303i , \u03b1) are holomorphic coordinates on (Z, I). Remark 4.9. \u2022 We can of course change the branch cut and branch of the log(t) and\nobtain new holomorphic Darboux coordinates. \u2022 By performing the coordinate change of fiber coordinate t \u2192\u2212i t , we find that the following are Darboux coordinates for \u03bb:\n\u03be i = \u03b6 i + \u03c42 2 (t\u22121zi \u2212 t zi ) \u03be\u0303i = \u03b6\u0303i + \u03c42\n2 (t\u22121Fi \u2212 t Fi )\n\u03b1 = \u03c3 + \u03c42 2\n(t\u22121\u3008Z\u0303 , \u03b6 \u3009 \u2212 t\u3008Z\u0303 , \u03b6 \u3009)\u2212 8ic log(t) , (4.88)\nrecovering the expressions found in the physics literature [AP12, Equation 2.13].\n4.4. Lifting the universal isometries of tree-level q-map spaces to the twistor space. Let (N , gN ) be a tree-level q-map space with dimR(N ) = 4n + 4 (n \u2265 1), and G the (3n+6)-dimensional universal group of isometries discussed in Sect. 3.4. If (Z, I, \u03bb, \u03c4 ) denotes the twistor space of (N , gN ), then it is known that the action of G must lift canonically to an action on (Z, I, \u03bb, \u03c4 ) preserving the twistor space structure [NT87] (i.e. it acts holomorphically, preserves the contact structure, and commutes with \u03c4 ). In the following, we wish to explicitly describe the lifts of the universal isometries that correspond to either an S-duality transformation, or to a an L-action transformation. For the explicit description of the lift of the S-duality, we will follow the presciption given in the physics literature [AP12].\nTo show that the explicit descriptions from below match the canonical lifts, we will make use of the following lemma:\nLemma 4.10. If f is an automorphism of (Z, I, \u03bb, \u03c4 ) covering the identity map of N with respect to the canonical projection Z \u2192 N, then f = IdZ . Hence, if we have a two lifts f1 and f2 of an isometry f of (N , gN ) to (Z, I, \u03bb, \u03c4 ) that preserve the twistor structure, then f1 = f2. Proof. Fix p \u2208 N and recall that the fibersZp ofZ \u2192 N are holomorphic submanifolds of (Z, I) with Zp \u223c= CP1 [Sal82, Section 4]. Using that f is holomorphic and fiberpreserving to conclude that it preserves the sphere Zp and acts on it as an element of PSL(2, C), which is the group of holomorphic automorphisms of CP1. Since it furthermore commuteswith the antipodalmap \u03c4 |Zp weconclude that it acts as an element of PSU(2). That element is induced by an element of SO(3) acting on Qp \u223c= R3 \u2283 Zp \u223c= S2, where Q \u2192 N denotes the quaternionic structure of N . Therefore it has a fixed point A \u2208 Zp. Using the horizontal lift with respect to the contact distribution determined by \u03bb, we can connect A to any element B \u2208 Z by a horizontal curve (this follows from the fact that the holonomy group of any QK manifold contains Sp(1) = SU(2)). That curve is the unique horizontal lift c\u0303 of a curve c in N from p to q = \u03c0(B)with initial condition A. Now since f preserves the contact distribution, it follows that it maps c\u0303 to another horizontal lift of the same curve c with the same initial condition, since f (A) = A. So f acts as identity on c\u0303 and hence f (B) = B.\nFrom Lemma 4.10 it follows that the lifts that will be discussed below coincide with the canonical lifts. We start by discussing the lift of the S-duality action, previously found in [APSV09,AP12].\nThe Darboux coordinates (4.73) found before match precisely the Darboux coordinates from [APSV09,AP12], provided we scale the fiber coordinate by\nt \u2192\u2212i t . (4.89) Indeed after such a scaling, we get\n\u03be i = \u03b6 i + \u03c42 2 (t\u22121zi \u2212 t zi ) \u03be\u0303i = \u03b6\u0303i + \u03c42\n2 (t\u22121Fi \u2212 t Fi )\n\u03b1 = \u03c3 + \u03c42 2\n(t\u22121\u3008Z\u0303 , \u03b6 \u3009 \u2212 t\u3008Z\u0303 , \u03b6 \u3009) , (4.90)\nmatching [AP12, Equation 2.13] (without the 1-loop correction term for \u03b1, since we are on the tree-level case).\nWe can now apply the lift of the S-duality action on the twistor space found in [AP12]:\nDefinition 4.11. With respect to the (smooth) splitting Z \u223c= N \u00d7 CP1, the lift of the S-duality action is such that on the t-variable of the CP1-fiber over (\u03c4 = \u03c41 + i\u03c42, ba, ta, ca, c0, ca, \u03c8) we have that ( a b c d ) \u2208 SL(2, R) acts as\n( a b c d ) \u00b7 t := c\u03c42 + (c\u03c41 + d + |c\u03c4 + d|)t\nc\u03c41 + d + |c\u03c4 + d| \u2212 c\u03c42t . (4.91)\nThis defines a global lift of the S-duality action (seeRemark 4.12 below).We furthermore remark that the SL(2, R) transformations generated by Xe and by Xh (i.e. producing an SL(2, R) transformation with c = 0) act trivially on t , and hence leave the twistor fiber invariant. In other words, the complexity of the transformation (4.91) is only due to the \u201chidden\" symmetry generated by X f .\nRemark 4.12. To check that the lift (4.91) actually defines an action of SL(2, R) it is convenient to follow the suggested Cayley transform of [AP12, Equation 3.5 and 3.6] on the t-coordinate given by\nz = t + i t \u2212 i , t = \u2212i 1 + z\n1\u2212 z . (4.92) Under the new fiber coordinate z, we have that (4.91) is now\n( a b c d ) \u00b7 z = c\u03c4 + d|c\u03c4 + d| z . (4.93)\nIt is then straightforward to check that (4.91) actually defines a lift of the SL(2, R)-action to Z . Proposition 4.13 [APSV09,AP12]. The lift of S-duality to the twistor space defined by (4.91) defines a holomorphic lift of S-duality to the twistor space. Furthermore, it preserves the holomorphic contact distribution and the real structure. In particular, it must coincide with the canonical lift of S-duality to the twistor space.\nProof. On the holomorphic coordinates (\u03be i , \u03be\u0303i , \u03b1) on the twistor space the element( a b c d ) \u2208 SL(2, R) acts as follows [APSV09,AP12]:\n\u03be0 \u2192 a\u03be 0 + b\nc\u03be0 + d , \u03bea \u2192 \u03be\na\nc\u03be0 + d , \u03be\u0303a \u2192 \u03be\u0303a + c 2(c\u03be0 + d) \u03baabc\u03be b\u03be c\n(\u0303 \u03be0 \u03b1\u0303 ) \u2192 ( d \u2212c \u2212b a ) (\u0303 \u03be0 \u03b1\u0303 ) + 1 6 \u03baabc\u03be a\u03beb\u03be c ( c2/(c\u03be0 + d) \u2212[c2(a\u03be0 + b) + 2c]/(c\u03be0 + d)2 ) ,\n(4.94)\nwhere \u03b1\u0303 is related to the previous coordinate \u03b1 via \u03b1 = \u22122\u03b1\u0303\u2212 \u03be i \u03be\u0303i . In particular, in the (\u03be i , \u03be\u0303i , \u03b1\u0303) coordinates we have that\n\u03bb = 1 8i (d\u03b1 + \u03be\u0303i d\u03be i \u2212 \u03be i d \u03be\u0303i ) \u00b7 s = \u2212 1 4i (d\u03b1\u0303 + \u03be i d \u03be\u0303i ) \u00b7 s . (4.95)\nTo check the transformation rule (4.94), it is enough to compute the infinitesimal action of S-duality on (\u03be i , \u03be\u0303i , \u03b1\u0303) and see that itmatches the infinitesimal version of (4.94).\nThe above transformation rule shows that the action of ( a b c d ) onZ is holomorphic away from the divisor D \u2282 Z given by D = {p \u2208 Z | s(p) = 0} \u222a {p \u2208 Z | c\u03be0 + d = 0} , (4.96)\nwhere we remark that {p \u2208 Z | s(p) = 0} = ({0} \u00d7 N ) \u222a ({\u221e} \u00d7 N ). Since the action of ( a b c d ) is globally defined and continuous on Z , and the divisor D is defined by the zero sets of the holomorphic section s and the holomorphic function c\u03be0 + d, it follows by the Riemann removable singularity theorem that the action is\nholomorphic on all of Z . Furthermore, under the action of ( a b c d ) given in (4.94) one can check that\n(d\u03b1\u0303 + \u03be i d \u03be\u0303i )\u2192 (d\u03b1\u0303 + \u03be i d \u03be\u0303i )/(c\u03be0 + d) . (4.97) so that in particular the contact distribution is preserved away from D. By continuity of \u03bb it must then be preserved on all of Z .\nTo check that the lift is compatible with the real structure, it is enough to check that (4.91) commutes with the antipodal map t \u2192\u22121/t . Indeed, we have\n( a b c d ) \u00b7 ( \u2212 1\nt\n) = c\u03c42t \u2212 (c\u03c41 + d + |c\u03c4 + d|) (c\u03c41 + d + |c\u03c4 + d|)t + c\u03c42 = \u2212 [ (a b c d ) \u00b7 t ]\u22121 . (4.98)\nIt then follow from Lemma 4.10 that the lift of S-duality given by (4.91) coincides with the canonical lift.\nWe now discuss how to holomorphically lift the universal isometries of (N , gN ) corresponding to the L-action, to its twistor space. These turns out to be simpler that the S-duality case from before, and the transformation rules of the holomorphic Darboux coordinates (\u03be i , \u03be\u0303i , \u03b1) from Sect. 4.3.2 turn out to have a very appealing relation to the transformation rules of the variables (\u03b6 i , \u03b6\u0303i , \u03c3 ), as we will see below in Proposition 4.15.\nDefinition 4.14. We define a lift of the action of L on N to Z \u223c= N \u00d7CP1 by declaring that it should act trivially on the CP1 fiber.\nNotice that the previous definition is consistent with the lift of S-duality, since the lift of S-duality is such that the SL(2, R) transformations contained in L (i.e. those generated by Xe and Xh) also leave invariant the twistor fiber.\nProposition 4.15. The lift of the L-action to Z is holomorphic, preserves the contact distribution and commutes with the real structure. Furthermore, it acts on the holomorphic Darboux coordinates (\u03be i , \u03be\u0303i , \u03b1) with the same transformation rules of (\u03b6 i , \u03b6\u0303i , \u03c3 ) under the correspondence \u03b6 i \u2194 \u03be i , \u03b6\u0303i \u2194 \u03be\u0303i , \u03c3 \u2194 \u03b1. Proof. Let us first focus on L2 = Iwa(SU (1, n + 2)) = R>0 \u00d7 R2n+2 \u00d7 R and denote an element of L2 by (r, \u03b7, \u03ba) \u2208 R>0 \u00d7 R2n+2 \u00d7 R, where we have used the short-hand notation \u03b7 = (\u0303\u03b7i , \u03b7i ). We then recall that the action of (r, \u03b7, \u03ba) on a point (z, \u03c1, \u03b6, \u03c3 ) \u2208 M \u00d7 R>0 \u00d7 R2n+2 \u00d7 R = N is given by (r, \u03b7, \u03ba) \u00b7 (z, \u03c1, \u03b6, \u03c3 ) = (z, r\u03c1,\u221ar\u03b6 + \u03b7, r\u03c3 +\u221ar\u3008\u03b6, \u03b7\u3009 + \u03ba) . (4.99) In particular, due to the relation \u03c1 = \u03c4 22 h(t)/2 we find that \u03c42 \u2192 \u221a r\u03c42 under the previous transformation. We then find that under the action of (r, \u03b7, \u03ba)\n\u03be i = \u03b6 i + \u03c42 2 (t\u22121zi \u2212 t zi ) \u2212\u2192 \u221ar\u03b6 i + \u03b7i +\u221ar \u03c42 2 (t\u22121zi \u2212 t zi ) = \u221ar\u03be i + \u03b7i \u03be\u0303i = \u03b6\u0303i + \u03c42 2 (t\u22121Fi \u2212 t Fi ) \u2212\u2192 \u221a r \u03b6\u0303i + \u03b7\u0303i + \u221a r \u03c42 2 (t\u22121Fi \u2212 t Fi ) = \u221a r \u03b6\u0303i + \u03b7\u0303i \u03b1 = \u03c3 + \u03c42 2 (t\u22121\u3008Z\u0303 , \u03b6 \u3009 \u2212 t\u3008Z\u0303 , \u03b6 \u3009) \u2212\u2192 r ( \u03c3 + \u03c42 2 (t\u22121\u3008Z\u0303 , \u03b6 \u3009 \u2212 t\u3008Z\u0303 , \u03b6 \u3009) )\n+ \u221a r ( \u3008\u03b6 + \u03c42\n2 (t\u22121 Z\u0303 \u2212 t Z\u0303), \u03b7\u3009\n) + \u03ba\n(4.100)\nor in more abbreviated notation\n(r, \u03b7, \u03ba) \u00b7 (\u03be, \u03b1) = (\u221ar\u03be + \u03b7, r\u03b1 +\u221ar\u3008\u03be, \u03b7\u3009 + \u03ba) . (4.101) Notice that (4.101) matches the action of (r, \u03b7, \u03ba) on (\u03b6, \u03c3 ) under the replacement \u03b6 i \u2194 \u03be i , \u03b6\u0303i \u2194 \u03be\u0303i , \u03c3 \u2194 \u03b1. Furthermore, (4.101) show that the lift of L2 is holomorphic away from the divisor:\nD = {p \u2208 Z | s(p) = 0} . (4.102) Since the lift extends continuously to a global lift to Z , it must then be holomorphic on all of Z .\nOn the other hand, we have that under the action of (r, \u03b7, \u03ba)\nd\u03b1 + \u3008\u03be, d\u03be \u3009 \u2192rd\u03b1 +\u221ar\u3008d\u03be, \u03b7\u3009 + r\u3008\u03be, d\u03be \u3009 +\u221ar\u3008\u03b7, d\u03be \u3009 = r(d\u03b1 + \u3008\u03be, d\u03be \u3009) , (4.103)\nso that the contact distribution is preserved on Z \u2212D. By continuity of \u03bb, it must then be preserved on all of Z .\nWe now focus on the action of L1 = R>0 Rn generated by the trivial lift of the vector fields D1 and V a . Recall that the R>0-factor acts via\n\u03bb \u00b7 (za, \u03c1, \u03b6 0, \u03b6 a, \u03b6\u03030, \u03b6\u0303a, \u03c3 ) = (\u03bbza, \u03c1, \u03bb\u22123/2\u03b6 0, \u03bb\u22121/2\u03b6 a, \u03bb3/2\u03b6\u03030, \u03bb1/2\u03b6\u0303a, \u03c3 ) (4.104)\nso the relation \u03c1 = \u03c4 22 h(t)/2 implies that \u03c42 \u2192 \u03bb\u22123/2\u03c42. One then easily checks that \u03bb \u00b7 (\u03be0, \u03bea, \u03be\u03030, \u03be\u0303a, \u03b1) = (\u03bb\u22123/2\u03be0, \u03bb\u22121/2\u03bea, \u03bb3/2\u03be\u03030, \u03bb1/2\u03be\u0303a, \u03b1) , (4.105)\nmatching the previous transformation rule for (\u03b6 i , \u03b6\u0303i , \u03c3 ). On the other hand, recall that the Rn-factor of L1 acts via\nv \u00b7 \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d ba ta \u03c1 \u03b6 0 \u03b6 a\n\u03b6\u03030 \u03b6\u0303a \u03c3\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0 = \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d\nba + va\nta\n\u03c1 \u03b6 0\n\u03b6 a + \u03b6 0va\n\u03b6\u03030 + 16kabcv avbvc\u03b6 0 + 12kabcv avb\u03b6 c \u2212 \u03b6\u0303ava \u03b6\u0303a \u2212 12\u03b6 0kabcvbvc \u2212 kabcvb\u03b6 c\n\u03c3\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0 . (4.106)\nBy a straightforward, but slightly tedious computation, one can show that the lifted action acts on (\u03be i , \u03be\u0303 , \u03b1) via\nv \u00b7 \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d \u03be0 \u03bea\n\u03be\u03030 \u03be\u0303a \u03b1\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0 = \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u03be0\n\u03bea + \u03be0va\n\u03be\u03030 + 16kabcv avbvc\u03be0 + 12kabcv avb\u03be c \u2212 \u03be\u0303ava \u03be\u0303a \u2212 12\u03be0kabcvbvc \u2212 kabcvb\u03be c\n\u03b1\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n(4.107)\nmatching the previous action on (\u03b6 i , \u03b6\u0303i , \u03c3 ). Formulas (4.105) and (4.107) show that the lift is holomorphic onZ\u2212D, and by the same argument as before, we then get that they must be holomorphic on all of Z . Furthermore, one can check that the action of L1 leaves the formd\u03b1+\u3008\u03be, d\u03be \u3009 invariant, so that the contact distribution is preserved on Z \u2212 D. As before, continuity of \u03bb then implies that the contact distribution must be preserved on all of Z .\nFinally, the fact that the lift of L preserves the real structure follows trivially from the fact that it leaves the twistor fibers invariant. We then conclude that lift of the L-action coincides with the canonical lift of the L-action to the twistor space."

            "heading": "5. Outlook for the Cases with Quantum Corrections",
            "text": "In this final section, we go back to the string theory setting, and summarize which quantum corrections of the tree-level q-map metric ofMIIBHM(X) are known or expected to preserve the S-duality SL(2, Z)-action by isometries (see for example [AP12]). Along the way, we mention how a similar \u201cS-duality\" action by isometries can be conjectured to hold for certain QK metrics, which are formulated in a setting independent of string theory.\nThe type of quantum corrections thatMIIBHM(X) receives is divided into the following types (see the review [Ale13, Section I.2.3] and the references therein for more details):\n\u2022 \u03b1\u2032-corrections: these modify the form of the prepotential (2.7) to F = Fcl + Fw.s (5.1)\nwhere Fcl matches (2.7) and Fw.s is the term containing the effects of perturbative \u03b1\u2032-corrections and world-sheet-instanton corrections. If \u03c7(X) is the Euler number of the Calabi\u2013Yau three-fold X ; Lis(x) denotes the polylogarithm functions; n (0) \u03b3 \u2208 Z denote the genus-0 Gopakumar-Vafa invariant associated to \u03b3 \u2208 H2(X, Z); and H+2 (X, Z) denotes the set of non-zero combinations of the form qa\u03b3\na for qa \u2208 Z\u22650 and {\u03b3 a} a given basis of H2(X, Z), then Fw.s is given by (see [Ale13, Equation I.28])\nFw.s. = \u03c7(X)\u03b6(3)(Z 0)2 2(2\u03c0 i)3 \u2212 (Z 0)2 (2\u03c0 i)3 \u2211\n\u03b3=qa\u03b3 a\u2208H+2 (X,Z) n(0)\u03b3 Li3(e 2\u03c0 iqa Za/Z0) , (5.2)\nwhere \u03b6(x) denotes the Riemann zeta function, and (Z0, Za) with a = 1, 2 . . . , n denote the special holomorphic coordinates. The first term in (5.4) corresponds to the perturbative \u03b1\u2032-correction, while the last term gives the contribution due to worldsheet instantons. We remark that due to the particular form of the correction Fw.s , the metric is no longer in the image of the q-map. These types of corrections break the continuous SL(2, R) of isometries that was found for the tree-level q-map metric, in particular the ones corresponding to the generators X f and Xh . Furthermore, it can be shown that the discrete group SL(2, Z) \u2282 SL(2, R) does not survive these corrections either [BGHL00, Section 4.4], so S-duality is broken when one includes \u03b1\u2032-corrections. The previous statements can be easily abstracted to a string theory-independent setting via the use of mutually local variations of BPS structures (see the beginning of [CT22, Section 3] for a reviewof this notion).More precisely, consider aCASKdomain specified by (M,Fcl)where dimC(M) = n +1 and Fcl has the form (2.7) (i.e. the CASKmanifold associated to a PSKmanifold in the image of the r-map). One can define a natural (trivial) rank 2n + 2 lattice \u2192 M spanned by \u03b3 i := Re(\u2202Zi ) and \u03b3i := \u2212Im(\u2202Zi ), where Zi are the canonical holomorphic coordinates of M and Zi := \u2202Fcl/\u2202Zi . Furthermore, a canonical central charge describing the CASK geometry is given by Z\u03b3 i := Zi and Z\u03b3i := Zi . To this data we can attach numbers (\u03b3 ) \u2208 Z with \u03b3 \u2208 such that the tuple (M, Z , , ) satisfies the conditions of a variation of BPS structures. We will assume that if (\u03b3 ) = 0 then \u03b3 \u2208 spanZ{\u03b3 i }, where i = 0, 1, . . . , n, so that the variation of BPS structures is mutually local. Furthermore, letting + := SpanZ\u22650{\u03b3 a} \u2212 {0}, we assume that the BPS indices have the following structure (compare with [AMPP15, equation (4.5)])\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23a8 \u23aa\u23a9 (q0\u03b3 0) = \u03c7 (q0\u03b3 0 + qa\u03b3 a) = (qa\u03b3 a) for qa\u03b3 a \u2208 + or \u2212 qa\u03b3 a \u2208 + (\u03b3 ) = 0 else.\n(5.3)\nThis particular structure is important for having the S-duality SL(2, Z) isometries, when also including mutually local D-instanton corrections (see the next point). One can then define the modified prepotential F = Fcl + Fw.s as follows:\nFw.s. = \u2212\u03c7 (Z 0)2 (2\u03c0 i)3 \u2212 (Z 0)2 (2\u03c0 i)3 \u2211\n\u03b3=qa\u03b3 a\u2208 + (\u03b3 )Li3(e\n2\u03c0 iqa Za/Z0) . (5.4)\nIf F = Fcl + Fw.s defines a CASK domain on M0 \u2282 M , then we can consider the QK metric obtained via the tree-level c-map as the metric containing the analog of the \u03b1\u2032-corrections from before. These kind of metrics are then not expected to have the SL(2, R) (or SL(2, Z)) of isometries, acting via the S-duality action that was found for the corresponding tree-level q-map metric. \u2022 gs-corrections: perturbatively in the string coupling gs , the metric only gets 1-loop corrections which corresponds to taking c = \u03c7(X)/192\u03c0 for the c-map construction. Hence, the \u03b1\u2032 and 1-loop gs-corrections give a metric within the class of (1-loop corrected) c-mapmetrics. On the other hand, the non-perturbative gs -corrections are divided in the so-called D-instanton corrections (which in Type IIB string theory are themselves divided into D(-1), D1, D3, and D5 corrections) and NS5-instanton corrections. These corrections take the metric outside the class of c-map metrics. While the inclusion of the full non-perturbative quantum corrections is not well under-\nstood, the inclusion of the D-instanton corrections was described in the physics literature [APSV09], by using the twistor space formulation of QK metrics. However, a mathematical treatment dealing with the issues of domains of definition of the metric and its signature has not been given yet. On the other hand, if one considers only the case with D(-1) and D1 instanton corrections, one lands in the case of the so-called mutually-local instanton corrections, which is better mathematically understood. A mathematical treatment of such mutually-local instanton-corrected QK metrics was given in [CT22] (see also [AB15] for a treatment from the physics literature using twistor methods). While the \u03b1\u2032 and 1-loop gs-corrections break the S-duality isometries, it has been shown in the physics literature that these are restored if one adds: either the D(-1) and D1 instanton corrections [AS09,AP12]; or D(-1), D1 and D3 corrections [AMP13, ABMP16,ABMP18,AP19]. Furthermore, S-duality is also expected to act by isometries when all the non-perturbative corrections are included. In a follow up work, the authors intend to do a mathematical treatment of S-duality for the case of mutually local D-instanton corrections, inspired by the work of [AS09,AP12].More precisely, the starting point would be a CASK geometry associated to a mutually local variation of BPS structures of the form given in (5.3), with holomorphic prepotential F = Fcl + Fw.s . By applying the construction of [CT22], one then obtains an \u201cinstanton corrected\" QKmetric. This instanton corrected QK metric would be the analog of the metric ofMIIBHM(X) with \u03b1\u2032-corrections, 1-loop, and D(-1), D1 instanton corrections, and the expectation is that such a metric carries an S-duality SL(2, Z)-action by isometries.\nAcknowledgements.
