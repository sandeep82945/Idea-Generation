    "abstractText": "Colloidal nanoparticles can be coated with a conformal shell to form multifunctional nanoparticles. For instance, plasmonic, magnetic, and catalytic properties, chemical stability and biocompatibility can be mixed and matched. Here, a facile synthesis for depositing metal boride amorphous coatings on colloidal metallic nanocrystals is introduced. The synthesis is independent of core size, shape, and composition. We have found that the shell synthesis is limited to nanoparticles capped with short molecular weight and low binding energy ligands, and does not work with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)coated Ag nanoparticles or thiol-coated Au nanoparticles. Shell thickness can be as thin as 3 nm with no apparent pinholes. High pressure studies show that the coatings are highly resistant to crystallization and are strongly bonded to the crystalline core. By choosing either CoB or NiB for the coating, the composite nanoparticles can be either ferromagnetic or paramagnetic at room temperature, respectively.",

For\ninstance, plasmonic, magnetic, and catalytic properties, chemical stability and biocompatibility can be\nmixed and matched. Here, a facile synthesis for depositing metal boride amorphous coatings on\ncolloidal metallic nanocrystals is introduced. The synthesis is independent of core size, shape, and\ncomposition. We have found that the shell synthesis is limited to nanoparticles capped with short\nmolecular weight and low binding energy ligands, and does not work with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-\ncoated Ag nanoparticles or thiol-coated Au nanoparticles. Shell thickness can be as thin as 3 nm with no\napparent pinholes. High pressure studies show that the coatings are highly resistant to crystallization and\nare strongly bonded to the crystalline core. By choosing either CoB or NiB for the coating, the\ncomposite nanoparticles can be either ferromagnetic or paramagnetic at room temperature, respectively.\nMetallic nanoparticles possess unique catalytic, electronic, optical, and magnetic properties.1 Coating a secondary material on a nanoparticle core (e.g. to form a core@shell nanoparticle) can result in a combination of these properties, and introduce biocompatibility and environmental stability to the bare core.2,3 Core@shell nanoparticles can have either crystalline or amorphous shells. While crystalline shells can be deposited on metallic cores to form nanoparticles such as Au@Ag,4 this remains challenging due to lattice mismatch,5 etching of the core due to shell electrochemical potential,6 and restricted chemical synthesis routes. In contrast, amorphous carbon and silica shells are more compatible with different metallic cores. Yet, carbon shell coatings generally require complicated synthesis routes which involve high temperature pyrolysis.7,8 Silica shell coatings have a facile aqueous phase chemical synthesis which is compatible with a wide variety of nanoparticle cores.7 However, silica shell coatings add limited functionality to the nanoparticle core as silica is chemically\neering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA\nivermore National Laboratory, Livermore,\nineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY\nStanford University, Stanford, CA 94305,\ntanford University, Stanford, CA 94305,\niversity, Stanford, CA 94305, USA\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\ninert, electrically insulating, and magnetic and optically inactive.\nMetallic glasses (MGs) are similar to silica in terms of their amorphous atomistic structure, chemical stability, and corrosion resistance,9,10 but have additional functionalities. Transition (Co/Ni/Fe) metal borides (TMBs) form MGs at 15\u201330 at% boron and are a viable alternative to silica shell coatings for nanoparticles. TMBs have been extensively explored as an economical alternative to noble metals for electrochemical water splitting,11\u201314 as catalyst supports, and for hydrogen generation from borohydrides.15\u201318 Coating noble metal nanoparticles with TMB can reduce the catalytic activity however, provide benets like lowering the wt% of noble metal in the catalyst and extending the lifetime of noble metal nanoparticles. TMBs are electrically conductive,19 chemically active,11 and have favorable mechanical20,21,22 and magnetic23 properties which make them ideal candidates as multifunctional nanoparticle shells.\nTMB nanoparticles have shown promise in nanomedicine as multifunctional components of radiation therapy and theranostics. Both FeB24 and NiB25 nanoparticles have low cytotoxicity with a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 82 mg mL\u22121 for pulmonary alveolar cells.25 In addition, TMBs degrade at physiologically relevant pH levels measured in lysosomes and thus should not accumulate in the body.24 Due to their magnetic properties, TMBs can be simultaneously used as contrast agents inmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and as a cancer treatment via magnetic hyperthermia.24 Amorphous NiB-coated Au nanocubes were shown to provide superior radiation tolerance when compared to silica, which makes them promising coatings for nanoparticle-enhanced radiation therapy26 and as delivery\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 30491\u201330498 | 30491\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Au and Pt cores are coated with NiB and CoB shells and their mechanical stability, optical behavior, and magnetic properties are investigated. The particles are also extremely stable and can withstand more than 55 GPa of hydrostatic pressure via a diamond anvil cell (DAC) without crystallization. NiB-coated Au nanoparticles retained the plasmonic properties of the Au core. NiB and CoB coated Au nanoparticles display super-paramagnetic and ferromagnetic behavior, respectively."

This synthesis could be scaled up from 10 mL to 200 mL batches by maintaining the same Au core concentration. For long term storage of particles, an additional 100 mL of methanol with 0.01 M oleic acid was added aer cleaning.

Thicker coatings of up to 30 nm, as shown in Fig. 1b, can be made by decreasing the initial Au nanoparticle concentration. For thicker coatings, some smaller NiB nanoparticles (<15 nm) nucleate in solution but can be removed using size selective centrifugal precipitation. Particles show a distinct boundary between the core and the shell, indicating that there is no diffusion. We have previously shown that Au nanocubes can also be coated in a similar manner.26 The presence of boron in the NiB structure has been observed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in our previous study20 and by others.23,33\u201341 The current synthesis strategy for NiB shell synthesis is similar to these previous studies indicating the presence of boron in the shell. In addition, several simulations of amorphous NiB structures have accounted for 19\u201335% boron content.42\u201347\nThe coating is also independent of defects in the core as citrate\u2013Au core nanoparticles, which have numerous defects, showed similar conformal coatings (Fig. 1c\u2013e). TEM diffraction of the 10 nm thick-coated particles in Fig. 1e showed the presence of (111), (200), (220) and (311) Au diffraction peaks and a broad amorphous ring (Fig. 1f). The coatings were conformal and pinhole free down to 3 nm shell thickness, which is comparable to silica coatings.48,49\nThe synthesis can be extended to other amorphous shells and crystalline cores. Citrate\u2013Au NPs were coated with CoB using a similar synthesis method to NiB coatings (Fig. 2a). Citrate-Au@CoB particles have a larger variability in shell thickness compared to citrate-Au@NiB since the particles are not as stable in solution. Small, 5 nm Pt nanoparticles were coated with NiB using the same method (Fig. 2b). While the Pt nanoparticles are not a uniform shape and the nal shapes vary, the coating thickness is relatively uniform. Fig. 2c the TEM diffraction pattern for the Pt@NiB nanoparticles with 5 nm\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\ncore. We only observed (111) diffraction ring for the 5 nm core Pt@NiB due to the limited crystallite size. Coatings on larger, 20 nm Pt nanoparticles show a distinct microstructure in TEM images, where lines of contrast begin at the core and extend to the surface (Fig. 2d). These lines of contrast are thought to arise due to the non-epitaxial and cluster-driven growth from the surface.33,50Growth occurs frommultiple nucleation sites on the Pt surface. The lines of contrast indicate the interfaces between two amorphous regions. STEM-EDS line mapping in Fig. 2d and e indicates a distinct boundary between the shell and core with no Pt diffusion in the shell.\nThe growth mechanism of the coating is dependent on the timing of adding oleic acid to the solution. If the methanol/oleic acid solution is added before NaBH4 reduction, then homogenous nucleation occurs and NiB nanoparticles will form without coating the core nanoparticles in solution. The lack of oleic acid in solution during NaBH4 reduction appears to increase the energy of homogenous nucleation, thereby promoting heterogenous nucleation on crystalline nanoparticles. By adding oleic acid one minute aer NaBH4 reduction, nucleation on the core nanoparticles rst occurs, aer which the oleic acid binds to the surface to enhance stability. Longer wait times before adding oleic acid (>5 minutes) led to dissolution of the shell as the MG shell is not stable in solution without oleic acid. The capping ligand on the core of the nanoparticle also plays a role in the nucleation of the MG shell on the surface of the core. Long polymeric ligands like polyvinyl pyrrolidone, commonly used in Ag nanoparticle synthesis, do not allow for the MG shell to nucleate on the core surface. Ionic and easily removable ligands like citrate and CTAC coated nanoparticles are ideal for MG shell nucleation.\nFig. 3c shows the XRD data for citrate-Au@NiB core\u2013shell nanoparticle and NiB nanoparticles.

This indicates that the shell on the citrate-Au core is stretched under tensile forces, which we attribute to the surface curvature of the core nanoparticle. The citrate\u2013Au core XRD peaks match with the bulk Au peak positions and the observed peak broadening is due to the small nanoparticle size. Fig. 3b shows the in situ XRD high pressure compression of citrateAu@NiB core\u2013shell nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were compressed from 0.6 GPa to 55 GPa under quasi-hydrostatic loading. The XRD peaks for Au core are present throughout the pressure range, and the peaks shi towards the right with increasing pressure indicating the lattice compression for Au core. The amorphous XRD peaks for NiB were overlapping with the Au crystalline peaks. The NiB coating stays amorphous up to 55 GPa pressure.\nFig. 3 (a) XRD of citrate-Au@NiB and amorphous NiB nanoparticles.

The plasmon resonance of the Au core nanoparticle is severely dampened aer coating with the NiB shell. The plasmon peak width increases aer the additional of the shell coating and the peak intensity drops with increasing thickness of the NiB shell, but the energy of the peak does not shi (Fig. 3c). The dampened plasmon resonance of citrate-Au@NiB nanoparticles can still be used for applications in biomedicine, photonics and as a pressure marker for high-pressure experiments.51\u201354\nThe magnetic properties of coated Au nanoparticles were investigated.

Citrate-Au@CoB nanoparticles exhibit ferromagnetic behavior that persists up to room temperature. Fig. 4a shows hysteresis in the eld dependence of the magnetization with nite remanence up to 300 K. The temperature dependence of the magnetization shown in Fig. 4c suggests a magnetic transition temperature above room temperature. Citrate-Au@NiB nanoparticles show transitions from ferromagnetic to superparamagnetic to paramagnetic across the temperature range 5\u2013300 K. At low temperatures, the citrate Au@NiB nanoparticles exhibit ferromagnetic behavior with hysteretic eld dependent magnetization loops (Fig. 4b). As eld dependent magnetization is measured at higher temperatures, we observe the onset of superparamagnetism and eventually weak paramagnetism at 300 K along with a diamagnetic background signal from the Si substrate. In order to determine the onset temperature of superparamagnetism, we measure the sample in 500 Oe aer it has been cooled in a strong magnetic eld of 1 T as well as in 500 Oe aer being cooled in zero magnetic eld. Temperature dependences of the eld cooled (FC) and zero eld cooled (ZFC) magnetization (Fig. 4d) deviate from each other at 12 K, where there is a maximum in the ZFC magnetization signal. The deviation of the FC and ZFC curves can be correlated with the onset of\nFig. 4 (a) Magnetization of citrate-Au@CoB nanoparticles at 10 K and 30 300 K. Insets for (a) and (b) showmoment near 0 Oe.

Below TB, the ZFC magnetization of nanoparticles is effectively frozen in random orientations, while the FC magnetization of the nanoparticles is aligned. The blocking temperature of 12 K observed in the NiB nanoparticles is consistent with other ndings that report a blocking temperature of 14 K for amorphous NiB nanoparticles.40. This is well below the transition temperature observed for the CoB core shell nanoparticles, which exhibit a TC above room temperature.\nIn summary, we have demonstrated a versatile metallic glass coating for nanoparticles synthesized in aqueous solution. Coating thickness can be precisely controlled by varying the nanoparticle concentration. The coating thickness has low variation above a thickness of 5 nm. These coatings are chemically stable, radiation resistant, and para/ferromagnetic. The synthesis strategy is universal for different core sizes, shapes, and compositions, and could easily be extended to other aqueous nanoparticle cores such Pd, Cu, Fe3O4 and CdSe.56\u201359 The aqueous phase shell synthesis limits the use of air and moisture sensitive nanoparticles as the crystalline core.
