    "abstractText": "Predicting photolithography performance in silico for a given materials combination is essential for developing better patterning processes. However, it is still an extremely daunting task because of the entangled chemistry with multiple reactions among many material components. Herein, we investigated the EUV-induced photochemical reaction mechanism of a model photoacid generator (PAG), triphenylsulfonium cation, using atomiC\u2013Scale materials modeling to elucidate that the acid generation yield strongly depends on two main factors: the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PAG cation associated with the electron-trap efficiency \u2018before C\u2013S bond dissociation\u2019 and the overall oxidation energy change of rearranged PAG associated with the proton-generation efficiency \u2018after C\u2013S bond dissociation\u2019. Furthermore, by considering stepwise reactions accordingly, we developed a two-parameter-based prediction model predicting the exposure dose of the resist, which outperformed the traditional LUMO-based prediction model. Our model suggests that one should not focus only on the LUMO energies but also on the energy change during the rearrangement process of the activated triphenylsulfonium (TPS) species. We also believe that the model is well suited for computational materials screening and/or inverse design of novel PAG materials with high lithographic performances.",

            "text": "In semiconductor device manufacturing, photolithography is a patterning process of a thin film by exposing a photo-sensitive material (photoresist) under a light, then selectively dissolved to fabricate a desired shape on nanometer-length scales. A minimum feature size, which is defined as the minimum size of the elements on a chip, such as the distance between the source and drain on a MOS transistor, could be decreased by decreasing the light\u2019s wavelength used in the lithography system according to the Rayleigh equation [1]. Conventional photolithography that uses deep ultraviolet (DUV) light with the 248 nm wavelength (from the KrF excimer laser) and 193 nm wavelength (from the ArF excimer laser) reduces the minimum feature size down to about 50 nm. Therefore, it is vital to develop a next-generation lithography technology beyond the DUV (KrF/ArF) technology to further scale down the feature size of electronic devices [2]. To that end, the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photolithography technology, which uses the extreme ultraviolet wavelength of 13.5 nm, has been developed and recently could scale down the feature size to 10 nm in a single exposure patterning. However, one of the significant challenges in EUV lithography is the \u2018stochastic issue\u2019 that the photons are sparsely distributed in the exposed area. Hence, a high EUV\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6244. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28176244 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6244 2 of 12\nexposure dose (low sensitivity) is required to avoid the deterioration of patterning performances, such as the resolution and the critical dimension uniformity (CDU). The following consequences are the lower productivity and higher operation costs of EUV scanners compared to the DUV counterparts [3\u20135]. Therefore, developing high-performance photoresist materials for lower EUV exposure dose (high sensitivity) is critical for high-volume manufacturing. This purpose requires an accurate computational/physical model to predict the EUV exposure dose from the fundamental properties of photoresist materials for high throughput screening, and inverse design would accelerate novel EUV photoresist materials developments. Similar to KrF and ArF photoresists, the typical EUV photoresists are chemically amplified resist (CAR) composites composed of polymers, photoacid generators (PAG), and quenchers. The most commonly utilized PAG is an onium salt based on the triphenylsulfonium cation (Ph3S+). However, as shown in Figure 1, the high energy of EUV photon (92 eV), compared to that of KrF (5 eV) light and ArF (6.4 eV), results in stark differences in the photochemical processes. Currently, the widely accepted photochemical processes of EUV CAR suggest that the initial incident EUV photons that interact with molecules like as polymer which consist of resist film to generate photoelectrons and subsequent secondary electrons [6,7]. PAG molecules interact with these secondary electrons and finally produce acids. Then, the acid-labile protecting group of the polymer is deprotected to release hydrophilic and acidic functional groups. As a result, the basic aqueous developer has a higher solubility for the exposed and deprotected resist film, as shown in Figure 2. Increasing acid generation yield could afford lower EUV dose without compromising resolution and CDU.\nMolecules\u00a02023,\u00a028,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 2\u00a0 of\u00a0

of 12\nTwo reaction pathways for acid generation from sulfonium PAG cations (Ph3S+-type) are proposed for EUV CAR systems [8,9]. One pathway is the \u2018internal excitation\u2019, in which high-energy (10\u201382 eV) secondary electrons could transfer energy to PAG cations and excite their electrons from the highest-occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) to the antibonding unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of the PAG molecules. Then, these excited PAG molecules dissociate to produce acids. The other pathway is \u2018electron trapping\u2019, in which the lower-energy (<10 eV) secondary electrons could be trapped by an antibonding lowestunoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the PAG molecules followed by subsequent PAG decomposition and acid generation, even though recent EUV lithography experiments demonstrated the importance of PAG cation reactions in an acid generation. However, detailed physical and chemical mechanisms of acid generation from PAG cation molecules are still poorly understood. In this work, we aim to develop a EUV sensitivity prediction model by the systematic investigation of the photochemical reactions and acid generation process of PAG cation in both \u2018internal excitation\u2019 and \u2018electron-trapping\u2019 mechanisms using atomiC\u2013Scale materials modeling. Herein, we targeted triphenylsulfonium (Ph3S+, TPS) cation, a conventional PAG cation, and its derivatives with symmetrically and unsymmetrically substituted functional groups, as shown in Figure 3. We first tried to reveal the effects of conventional calculated properties (HOMO, LUMO, band gap, pKa) of TPS-based cations on the EUV exposure dose based on the published experimental data (Asakura et al.) [10]. Next, we investigated the entire photo-reaction mechanism of TPS cations under EUV exposure in order to determine the key parameters of the acid generation and EUV exposure dose. We also developed a two-parameter-based prediction model for the PAG performance on EUV exposure dose based on our own experimental data set. Finally, we suggest practical design principles for selecting and synthesizing new EUV PAG materials with superior properties.\nMolecules\u00a02023,\u00a028,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 3\u00a0 of\u00a0 13\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\ntrapping\u2019,\u00a0in\u00a0which\u00a0the\u00a0lower-energy\u00a0(<10\u00a0eV)\u00a0secondary\u00a0electrons\u00a0could\u00a0be\u00a0trapped\u00a0by\u00a0an\u00a0 antibonding\u00a0 lowest-unoccupied\u00a0molecular\u00a0 orbital\u00a0 (LUMO)\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 PAG\u00a0molecules\u00a0 followed\u00a0by\u00a0subsequent\u00a0PAG\u00a0decomposition\u00a0and\u00a0acid\u00a0generation,\u00a0even\u00a0though\u00a0recent\u00a0EUV\u00a0 lithography\u00a0experiments\u00a0demonstrated\u00a0the\u00a0importance\u00a0of\u00a0PAG\u00a0cation\u00a0reactions\u00a0in\u00a0an\u00a0acid\u00a0 generation.\u00a0However,\u00a0detailed\u00a0physical\u00a0and\u00a0chemical\u00a0mechanisms\u00a0of\u00a0acid\u00a0generation\u00a0from\u00a0 PAG\u00a0cation\u00a0molecules\u00a0are\u00a0still\u00a0poorly\u00a0understood.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a02.\u00a0(a)\u00a0Photolithography\u00a0patterning\u00a0process\u00a0and\u00a0(b)\u00a0solubility\u00a0change\u00a0of\u00a0polymer\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0exposed\u00a0area.\u00a0\nIn\u00a0this\u00a0work,\u00a0we\u00a0aim\u00a0to\u00a0develop\u00a0a\u00a0EUV\u00a0sensitivity\u00a0prediction\u00a0model\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0systematic\u00a0 investigation\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0photochemical\u00a0reactions\u00a0and\u00a0acid\u00a0generation\u00a0process\u00a0of\u00a0PAG\u00a0cation\u00a0in\u00a0 both\u00a0\u2018internal\u00a0excitation\u2019\u00a0and\u00a0\u2018electron-trapping\u2019\u00a0mechanisms\u00a0using\u00a0atomiC\u2013Scale\u00a0materials\u00a0 modeli g.\u00a0Her in,\u00a0we\u00a0targeted\u00a0triph nylsulfonium\u00a0(Ph3S+,\u00a0TPS)\u00a0cation,\u00a0a\u00a0conventional\u00a0PAG\u00a0 cation,\u00a0 nd\u00a0its\u00a0derivatives\u00a0with\u00a0sy metrically\u00a0and\u00a0unsymmetrically\u00a0substituted\u00a0functional\u00a0 groups,\u00a0a \u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a03.\u00a0We\u00a0first\u00a0tried\u00a0to\u00a0reve \u00a0the\u00a0effec s\u00a0of\u00a0conventional\u00a0calculated\u00a0 properties\u00a0(HOMO,\u00a0LUMO,\u00a0band\u00a0gap,\u00a0pKa)\u00a0of\u00a0TPS-based\u00a0cations\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0EUV\u00a0 xposure\u00a0dose\u00a0 based\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0published\u00a0experimental\u00a0data\u00a0(Asakura\u00a0e \u00a0al.)\u00a0[10].\u00a0Next,\u00a0w \u00a0inv stigated\u00a0the\u00a0 entire\u00a0photo-reaction\u00a0mech nism\u00a0of\u00a0TPS\u00a0cations\u00a0under\u00a0EUV\u00a0 xposure\u00a0in\u00a0or er\u00a0to\u00a0determine\u00a0 the\u00a0key\u00a0parameters\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0acid\u00a0generation\u00a0and\u00a0EUV\u00a0exposure\u00a0dose.\u00a0We\u00a0also\u00a0developed\u00a0a\u00a0 two-parameter-based\u00a0prediction\u00a0model\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0PAG\u00a0performance\u00a0on\u00a0EUV\u00a0exposure\u00a0dose\u00a0 based\u00a0on\u00a0our\u00a0own\u00a0experimental\u00a0data\u00a0set.\u00a0Finally,\u00a0we\u00a0suggest\u00a0practical\u00a0design\u00a0principles\u00a0for\u00a0 selecting\u00a0and\u00a0synthesizing\u00a0new\u00a0EUV\u00a0PAG\u00a0materials\u00a0with\u00a0superior\u00a0properties.\u00a0\nFigure\u00a03.\u00a0Target\u00a0PAG\u00a0cation\u00a0structures\u00a0obtained\u00a0from\u00a0Ref.\u00a0[10].\u00a0(a)\u00a0Triphenylsulfonium\u00a0(TPS),\u00a0(b)\u00a0\ntri(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethylphenyl)\u00a0 sulfonium\u00a0 (MDP),\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 tri(4-methoxy-3-methylphenyl)\u00a0 sul-\nfonium(MMP),\u00a0 and\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 tri(4-methoxy-3-phenylphenyl)sulfonium)\u00a0 (MPP)\u00a0 with\u00a0 nona-fluorobu-\ntanesulfonate\u00a0as\u00a0the\u00a0common\u00a0conjugate\u00a0base.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0"

Nonafluorobutanesulfonate was the common counter anion of each PAG, and propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA) was used as the casting solvent. Table 1 lists the DFT-calculated properties, including LUMO, band gap energies, and the experimental ArF and EUV exposure dose of PAG cations in Figure 3 from Asakura et al. [10]. In Figure 4a\u2013c, we can observe the linear dependence of experimental ArF exposure dose-to-clear on the LUMO, band gap, and pKa of diphenylsulfide. While ArF dose-to-clear exhibits a moderate dependence on the LUMO of PAG cations with a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.67, band gap and the pKa, the newly suggested parameter by our study, exhibit a higher correlation with the ArF dose-to-clear (R2 = 0.95 for the band gap and 0.97 for pKa).

            "text": "We mentioned two hypothetical reaction pathways of acid generation from PAG: \u2018internal excitation\u2019 and \u2018electron trapping\u2019. As the band gap becomes narrower, internal excitation would be easier because electrons occupying HOMO can easily excite into the LUMO level. Furthermore, as the LUMO level becomes lower, a secondary electron would be more easily trapped in the LUMO. Therefore, the efficiency of the \u2018internal excitation\u2019 and \u2018electron-trapping\u2019 processes should strongly depend on the band gap and LUMO energies. To understand the overall deprotonation process of the PAG cation, we investigated the detailed EUV photochemical reactions of the TPS cation, a conventional PAG cation. For both processes, the TPS cation is postulated to decompose into diphenylsulfide (DPS) and phenyl radical, followed by the formation of rearranged TPS species. Then, the excited or electron-trapped rearranged TPS releases protons to form acids with the counter-anion of the PAG onium salt. Understanding this entire mechanism elucidates the rate-determining step and fundamental properties of acid generation to control the acid generation yield. Figure 5 shows the photochemical reaction energy profile of TPS cation under EUV exposure. In our computational study, \u2018electron trapping\u2019 is assumed to occur when the TPS cation captures lower energy secondary electrons (<10 eV). Once the TPS radical is gener-\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6244 5 of 12\nated, it spontaneously dissociates from the stable DPS molecule and phenyl radical (1). On the other hand, \u2018internal excitation\u2019 is assumed to occur when the secondary electron transfers energy to an electron by excitation from HOMO to LUMO. This excited TPS cation also undergoes the dissociation into DPS radical cation and a phenyl radical (2) or DPS molecule with a phenyl cation (2-1). The unstable phenyl radical would soon attack the ortho-position of the phenyl ring in the DPS molecule to form an (ortho)-(phenylthio) biphenyl radical (3) [11\u201313]. After or during its generation, the (ortho)-(phenylthio) biphenyl radical (3) reduces other PAG cations to form the cation (4). The subsequent proton release and recombination between the proton and PAG counter-anion would be the last step of the photo acid generation from the PAG cation (5).\nMolecules\u00a02023,\u00a028,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 5\u00a0 of\u00a0 13\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n2.2.\u00a0Simulation\u00a0Study\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0Photochemical\u00a0Reaction\u00a0Profile\u00a0of\u00a0TPS\u00a0Cation\u00a0 We\u00a0mentioned\u00a0two\u00a0hypothetical\u00a0reaction\u00a0pathways\u00a0of\u00a0acid\u00a0generation\u00a0from\u00a0PAG:\u00a0\u2018in-\nternal\u00a0excitation\u2019\u00a0and\u00a0\u2018electron\u00a0trapping\u2019.\u00a0As\u00a0the\u00a0band\u00a0gap\u00a0becomes\u00a0narrower,\u00a0internal\u00a0excitation\u00a0would\u00a0be\u00a0easier\u00a0because\u00a0electrons\u00a0occupying\u00a0HOMO\u00a0can\u00a0easily\u00a0excite\u00a0 into\u00a0 the\u00a0 LUMO\u00a0level.\u00a0Furthermore,\u00a0as\u00a0the\u00a0LUMO\u00a0level\u00a0becomes\u00a0lower,\u00a0a\u00a0secondary\u00a0electron\u00a0would\u00a0 be\u00a0more\u00a0easily\u00a0trapped\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0LUMO.\u00a0Therefore,\u00a0the\u00a0efficiency\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0\u2018internal\u00a0excitation\u2019\u00a0 and\u00a0 \u2018electron-trapping\u2019\u00a0processes\u00a0should\u00a0strongly\u00a0depend\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0band\u00a0gap\u00a0and\u00a0LUMO\u00a0 energies.\u00a0To\u00a0understand\u00a0the\u00a0overall\u00a0deprotonation\u00a0process\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0PAG\u00a0cation,\u00a0we\u00a0investigated\u00a0the\u00a0detailed\u00a0EUV\u00a0photochemical\u00a0reactions\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0TPS\u00a0cation,\u00a0a\u00a0conventional\u00a0PAG\u00a0 cation.\u00a0For\u00a0both\u00a0processes,\u00a0the\u00a0TPS\u00a0cation\u00a0is\u00a0postulated\u00a0to\u00a0decompose\u00a0into\u00a0diphenylsulfide\u00a0 (DPS)\u00a0and\u00a0phenyl\u00a0radical,\u00a0followed\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0formation\u00a0of\u00a0rearranged\u00a0TPS\u00a0species.\u00a0Then,\u00a0the\u00a0 excited\u00a0or\u00a0electron-trapped\u00a0rearranged\u00a0TPS\u00a0releases\u00a0protons\u00a0to\u00a0form\u00a0acids\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0counter-anion\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0PAG\u00a0onium\u00a0salt.\u00a0Understanding\u00a0this\u00a0entire\u00a0mechanism\u00a0elucidates\u00a0the\u00a0ratedetermining\u00a0step\u00a0and\u00a0fundamental\u00a0properties\u00a0of\u00a0acid\u00a0generation\u00a0to\u00a0control\u00a0the\u00a0acid\u00a0generation\u00a0yield.\u00a0\nFigure\u00a05\u00a0shows\u00a0the\u00a0photochemical\u00a0reaction\u00a0energy\u00a0profile\u00a0of\u00a0TPS\u00a0cation\u00a0under\u00a0EUV\u00a0 exposure.\u00a0In\u00a0our\u00a0computational\u00a0study,\u00a0\u2018electron\u00a0trapping\u2019\u00a0is\u00a0assumed\u00a0to\u00a0occur\u00a0when\u00a0the\u00a0 TPS\u00a0cation\u00a0captures\u00a0lower\u00a0energy\u00a0secondary\u00a0electrons\u00a0(<10\u00a0eV).\u00a0Once\u00a0the\u00a0TPS\u00a0radical\u00a0is\u00a0 generated,\u00a0it\u00a0spontaneously\u00a0dissociates\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0stable\u00a0DPS\u00a0molecule\u00a0and\u00a0phenyl\u00a0radical\u00a0 (1).\u00a0On\u00a0the\u00a0other\u00a0hand,\u00a0\u2018internal\u00a0excitation\u2019\u00a0is\u00a0assumed\u00a0to\u00a0occur\u00a0when\u00a0the\u00a0secondary\u00a0electron\u00a0transfers\u00a0energy\u00a0to\u00a0an\u00a0electron\u00a0by\u00a0excitation\u00a0from\u00a0HO O\u00a0to\u00a0LUMO.\u00a0This\u00a0excited\u00a0TPS\u00a0 cation\u00a0also\u00a0undergoes\u00a0the\u00a0dissociation\u00a0into\u00a0DPS\u00a0radical\u00a0cation\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0phenyl\u00a0radical\u00a0(2)\u00a0or\u00a0 DPS\u00a0molecule\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0phenyl\u00a0cation\u00a0(2-1).\u00a0The\u00a0unstable\u00a0phenyl\u00a0radical\u00a0would\u00a0soon\u00a0attack\u00a0 the\u00a0ortho-position\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0phenyl\u00a0ring\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0DPS\u00a0molecule\u00a0to\u00a0form\u00a0an\u00a0(ortho)-(phenylthio)\u00a0 biphenyl\u00a0 radical\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 [11\u201313].\u00a0After\u00a0or\u00a0during\u00a0 its\u00a0generation,\u00a0 the\u00a0 (ortho)-(phenylthio)\u00a0biphenyl\u00a0radical\u00a0(3)\u00a0reduces\u00a0other\u00a0PAG\u00a0cations\u00a0to\u00a0form\u00a0the\u00a0cation\u00a0(4).\u00a0The\u00a0subsequent\u00a0proton\u00a0 release\u00a0and\u00a0recombination\u00a0between\u00a0the\u00a0proton\u00a0and\u00a0PAG\u00a0counter-anion\u00a0would\u00a0be\u00a0the\u00a0last\u00a0 step\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0photo\u00a0acid\u00a0generation\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0PAG\u00a0cation\u00a0(5).\u00a0\nFigure\u00a05.\u00a0Full\u00a0reaction\u00a0mechanism\u00a0of\u00a0TPS\u00a0molecule\u00a0under\u00a0EUV.\u00a0Relative\u00a0energy\u00a0values\u00a0with\u00a0TPS\u00a0\ncation\u00a0are\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0eV\u00a0unit.\u00a0The\u00a0*\u00a0represents\u00a0the\u00a0excited\u00a0state\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0molecule.\u00a0\nUsually, deprotonation energy varies by proton acceptor molecules, but to simplify our model, we introduced another parameter that could represent the proton release ability.

            "text": "As shown in Figure 4, there is a strong correlation between the band gap and ArF dose. It could be translated that the \u2018internal excitation\u2019 pathway is dominant under the ArF exposure, and the molecular decomposition of TPS is accelerated by a narrower band gap, which makes electron excitation more accessible from HOMO to LUMO. In the case of the EUV dose, LUMO shows a relatively higher correlation than the band gap and pKa. As we supposed in the previous Section 2.2, secondary electron trapping by TPS cation might proceed under EUV exposure. Unlike the ArF exposure case, only a LUMO level is essential for the \u2018electron trapping\u2019 pathway because the low-lying LUMO energy level can be more easily occupied by electrons. However, LUMO is not powerful enough to solely predict EUV dose with a less than moderate correlation of R2 = 0.37 (Figure 4d).\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6244 6 of 12\nTo improve the EUV dose predictability, we focused on the post-electron-trap deprotonation processes. The electron charge distribution is significantly affected by the structural changes resulting from decomposition reactions. Therefore, we separated the whole process into \u2018before-decomposition\u2019 and \u2018after-decomposition.\u2019 in Figure 5. For the \u2019before-decomposition\u2019 step, the band gap or LUMO level of TPS is evidently decisive, as we already discussed in the Section 2.2. Otherwise, for the \u2018after-decomposition\u2019 step, there is an energy barrier from structures 3 to 5. To represent this energy barrier, we selected four parameters as Pafter: deprotonation efficiency of DPS 2 (pKa(DPS)), deprotonation efficiency of rearranged TPS radical cation 4 (pKa(rearranged)), oxidation potential of rearranged TPS radical 3 (\u2206Goxidation), and overall energy required to deprotonate the rearranged TPS radical 3 (\u2206Gtotal). Each energy is obtained as an eV unit by equations proposed in Section 3\u2014\u2018Computational Details\u2019. We postulated a two-parameter regression model based on combining the parameters obtained from the before- and after-decomposition steps. By the regression analysis with the experimental exposure dose data and the computed molecular properties, we obtain two multiple-linear prediction models:\nEUVdose = \u03b1\u00d7 LUMO + \u03b2\u00d7 Pafter + \u03b3 (1)\nHerein, the above four parameters (pKa(DPS), pKa(rearranged), and \u2206Goxidation, \u2206Gtotal) can be a Pafter. We applied this regression model to the test set of four TPS cations in Figure 3. Depending on the selection of Pafter parameters, a correlation between experimental EUV dose and predicted EUV dose varies, and \u2206Gtotal afforded the best correlation (see Table 2)."

            "text": "In the Sections 2.2 and 2.3, we could conclude that separated reaction steps should be considered: before- and after- C\u2013S bond dissociation. Also, we discovered that four additional parameters, pKa(DPS), pKa(rearranged), \u2206Goxidation, and \u2206Gtotal, could be considerable in the \u2018after C\u2013S bond dissociation\u2019. When we consider both steps together, the accuracy of EUV dose prediction becomes better for the data sets from ref. [10]. To figure out the most dominant parameter sets, we obtained additional experimental data, the conditions of which are summarized in Table 3. Herein, sets 1, 2, 3, and validation sets contain unsymmetrical TPS molecules. The table shows that only PAG molecules vary in each set while maintaining the same PAG/PDQ/Polymer/solvent type and concentration to verify the correlation between PAG and EUV dose. To apply our study to extended sets of PAG cations, including asymmetrically substituted TPS, we need to determine the most likely dissociable phenyl ring of the TPS cation scaffold and the regioselectivity of new C-C bond formation. First, we compared singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) or mono- and di-substituted TPS neutral radicals to determine the dissociative pathway of the electron trapping mechanism (Figure 6). The hydroxyl group (-OH) represents the electro-donating substituents, and the trifluoromethane(-CF3) represents the electron-withdrawing substituents. While the electron-donating/-withdrawing nature of the substituent influences the conformation of the antibonding orbital responsible for the C\u2013S bond dissociation, the antibonding orbital node locates on the C\u2013S bond of the most electron-rich phenyl ring for all cases of Figure 6. As a result, the relatively more electron-donating group-attached phenyl ring would dissociate from the sulfur center. Because of the conjugation, the C\u2013S bond dissociation would prefer the formation of the substituted phenyl radical and neutral diphenyl sulfide, as shown in structure 1 of Figure 5.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6244 7 of 12\nThe C-C bond formation will follow as the substituted-phenyl radical attacks the more electron-rich site between two phenyl rings of the diphenylsufide.\nTable 3.

4 lists the coefficients of determination (R2) of two types of analyses: the LUMO-based single-parameter correlation with EUV dose prediction and LUMO- and \u2206Gtotal-based on a two-parameter EUV dose-prediction model for five sets of photoacid generators (PAG). Based on the above rearrangement scheme, we calculated each PAG molecule\u2019s LUMO, pKa(DPS), pKa(rearranged), \u2206Goxidation, and \u2206Gtotal. We performed a two-parameter linear regression model like Equation (1). Results from all models are summarized in the Supporting Information of this paper. We checked the correlation between parameters to avoid over-correlations in the regression model. Among the four combinations of two-parameter regression models, the pair of LUMO and \u2206Gtotal predicted the EUV dose most precisely while maintaining the orthogonality with a low correlation between the two parameters. (See Supporting Information Tables S1\u2013S4). Table 4 compares the LUMO-based dose prediction with the LUMO and \u2206Gtotal-based dose prediction for three sets. As shown in Table 4, the experimental and predicted dose value correlation is less than 0.7 from the prediction only based on the LUMO. Otherwise, the prediction accuracy increases when we use \u2206Gtotal together (R2 > 0.7). It is reasonable because deprotonation from the rearranged TPS (structure 3, Figure 5) was determined as the rate-determining step for the electron-trapping hypothesis. During the electrontrapping process, the phenyl ring with electron-donating substituents would be distorted and dissociates spontaneously, as discussed in Section 2.4. Therefore, changing its structure\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6244 8 of 12\nand accepting secondary electrons has restrictions if there is a structural constraint on the TPS. Also, the chemical property of rearranged TPS differs from the original structure, and deprotonation efficiency relies on which substituent group is attached to each ring.\nWe examined our two-parameter EUV dose-prediction model using seven PAG molecules as the validation set, which has different PAGs; otherwise, the same experimental conditions as set 3. As shown in Figure 7, the predicted EUV dose is well-matched with the experimental EUV dose values with a maximum error of 7.2 mJ/cm2. Otherwise, another parameter set predicts dose with R2 = 0.08 with pKa(rearranged) and 0.14 with \u2206Goxidation, respectively.

            "text": "In this section, we want to discuss the novel design strategy of the new PAG molecule. In general, an electron-withdrawing group stabilizes the LUMO level, which might be helpful in lowering the EUV dose. However, at the same time, the electrons-withdrawing group hinders the oxidation, which eventually increases \u2206Gtotal and EUV dose. This might provide a compelling rationalization for the negative correlation between LUMO and EUV\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6244 9 of 12\ndose in the data set from ref. [10]. As summarized in Table 4, it follows the following regression model (Equation (3)).\nEUVdose = \u22122.69 \u00d7 LUMO + 12.63 \u00d7 \u2206Gtotal \u2212 37.63 (3)\nThe five times stronger and positive correlation with \u2206Gtotal can be translated that, for this particular resist system, increasing deprotonation efficiency (smaller) would work better than increasing electron-trapping efficiency (lower LUMO). Therefore, we can suggest a stronger electron-donating group-substituted TPS as a better candidate PAG cation for this system. Additionally, the Hammett constant \u03c3p for para-substituted benzoic acid [14] works as a practical guideline for the TPS substituent effect, exhibiting a strong correlation (R2 > 0.95) with both calculated LUMO and pKa values (Figure 8). Considering the trade-off between electron-trapping and deprotonation efficiencies, careful selection of substituent groups for TPS is essential for optimizing photoresist composition.

When the regression model is obtained for a given experimental condition, we can set the direction of the PAG design strategy, either lowering or heightening LUMO or \u2206Gtotal by selecting proper phenyl substituents of TPS cations. As show in Table 4, the coefficient for LUMO (\u03b1) and \u2206Gtotal (\u03b2) vari s depending on the experimental conditions and can be classified into three categories.\n(1) \u03b1 and \u03b2 >0. As we discussed previously, satisfying both low LUMO (electronwithdrawing substituents) and low \u2206Gtotal (electron-donating substituents) will be frustrated by the trade-off. One might suggest hybrid-type TPS cations with both electron-withdrawing and donating substituents; (2) \u03b1 < 0 and \u03b2 > 0. For this photoresist system, electron-donating substituents will be preferred in both LUMO and \u2206Gtotal-related terms. In this situation, lowering the oxidation potential barrier of rearranged TPS intermediates might be more critical than lowering the LUMO of TPS cations (deprotonation-dominated system); (3) \u03b1 >0 and \u03b2 < 0. In this photoresist system, electron-withdrawing substituents could be beneficial to lower the EUV dose by lowering LUMO without significant deterioration of deprotonation efficiency. In this situation, lowering LUMO is more effective than lowering \u2206Gtotal (electron-trapping-dominated system).\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6244 10 of 12\nThe factors \u03b1 and \u03b2 would vary according to the experimental conditions and concentrations of PAG, PDQ, and polymer. We can also imagine that when the structural distortion of TPS is sterically or electronically forbidden, the TPS cation might have less tendency to accept secondary electrons, and lowering LUMO will not guarantee a lower EUV dose anymore. Also, if a strong basic PDQ is employed, the deprotonation efficiency becomes meaningless, making the electron-trapping step the rate-determining step. The exact contribution of each term should be determined by experiments."

            "text": "Understanding and analyzing the entangled chemical events and related parameters of EUV-exposed photoresists is mandatory for the theoretical prediction of lithography performances. Herein, we focused on the PAG, an acid-generation component that strongly affects the solubility change of polymer at the EUV exposed area. We figured out that one-parameter, LUMO-based EUV sensitivity prediction has low accuracy. Therefore, we investigated the entire proton generation(deprotonation) and energy profile of the TPS cation, the most commonly employed photo-active molecular scaffold for PAG. We envisioned the reaction into two stages based on the C\u2013S bond dissociation as the critical point, \u2018before-decomposition\u2019 and \u2018after-decomposition\u2019 of TPS. On the shoulder of the traditional understanding of the \u2018before-decomposition\u2019 stage described by LUMO, we introduced four new parameters, pKa(DPS), pKa(rearranged), \u2206Goxidation, and \u2206Gtotal, for the \u2018after decomposition\u2019 step and developed a two-parameter linear regression model by pairing with LUMO from before the decomposition step. A combination of LUMO and \u2206Gtotal gives the best dose-prediction model among the four parameters. Next, we verified our new prediction model with the other experimental data. For three experiments, the experimental dose and predicted dose show a correlation of R2= 0.66, 0.67, and 0.91, respectively. Then, we applied this two-parameter model to predict the EUV of new PAG molecules (validation set, Table 4) within less than 7.2 mJ/cm2 error range. Finally, we suggested the molecular design strategy based on our two-parameter EUV dose-prediction model.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28176244/s1, Table S1.
