Throughout the paper the symbol \u2297 denotes the Kronecker product of matrices, while \u2295 is employed for the Kronecker sum of matrices. Systems in form (1) naturally arise when discretizing in space some Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) defined on tensor product domains and with appropriate boundary conditions. In those cases, A\u00b5 are matrices which correspond to differential or fractional one-dimensional operators after discretization with (nonuniform) finite differences, tensor product finite or spectral elements, and usually encapsulate boundary conditions. Typical examples are (systems of) evolutionary PDEs which contain diffusion\u2013advection operators, among the others.\nIn References [2, 3] it is shown that the well-known exponential Runge\u2013Kutta method of order two etd2rk\nun2 = un + \u03c4\u03d51(\u03c4K)F (tn,un), un+1 = un2 + \u03c4\u03d52(\u03c4K)(g(tn+1,un2)\u2212 g(tn,un)), (2)\nwhere \u03c4 is the time step size, if directionally split outperforms other well-established methods in the solution of stiff advection\u2013diffusion\u2013reaction models.

However, the second order accuracy of the formula with respect to the time step size limits its applicability to schemes of at most order two.\nIn this paper we aim at introducing directional split approximations of third order with respect to \u03c4 for exponential-like \u03d5-functions of matrices with d-dimensional Kronecker sum structure.

(4b)\nFrom Reference [6, Section 5.2], we know that we can construct integrators of stiff order three in which the coefficients aij(\u03c4K) and bi(\u03c4K) involve just the \u03d51 and \u03d52 functions. Therefore, we will fully develop our approximation techniques using these two functions only.\nThe starting point for the realization of efficient direction split exponential integrators is the following formula for the matrix exponential of the Kronecker sum K = A\u22971 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+A\u2297d [4, 5]\nexp(\u03c4K)v = exp(\u03c4A\u22971) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 exp(\u03c4A\u2297d)v = (exp(\u03c4Ad)\u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 exp(\u03c4A1))v = vec(V \u00d71 exp(\u03c4A1)\u00d72 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7d exp(\u03c4Ad)).\n(5)\nHere V is an order-d tensor such that vec(V ) = v and \u00d7\u00b5 denotes the \u00b5-mode product, i.e., a tensor-matrix product along the direction \u00b5. The concatenation of \u00b5-mode products is usually referred to as Tucker operator. The advantage of this formulation is that it allows to compute the action of the matrix exponential of K through a single Tucker operator (that, in fact, constitutes the main part of the computational cost) without assembling the matrix itself, and relying on high performance level-3 BLAS operations after the computation of the small sized matrix exponentials exp(\u03c4A\u00b5) (which has negligible computational cost). The employment of time integrators that rely on such matrix/tensor formulations have received a great attention in the latest years (see, for instance, References [7\u201311]). Concerning the functions \u03d5\u2113 with \u2113 > 0, which are needed for the exponential integrators considered in this work, we notice that the first equality in formula (5) is not valid anymore. However, in Reference [2] it is shown that\n\u03d5\u2113(\u03c4K)v = \u2113! d\u22121\u03d5\u2113(\u03c4A\u22971) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03d5\u2113(\u03c4A\u2297d)v +O(\u03c42)\n= \u2113!d\u22121 (\u03d5\u2113(\u03c4Ad)\u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 \u03d5\u2113(\u03c4A1))v +O(\u03c42) = vec ( \u2113!d\u22121V \u00d71 \u03d5\u2113(\u03c4A1)\u00d72 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7d \u03d5\u2113(\u03c4Ad) ) +O(\u03c42), (6)\nof which expressions (3) are particular cases. Notice that in the case d = 2 the formula simply reduces to\n\u03d5\u2113(\u03c4(A\u22971 +A\u22972))v = vec ( \u03d5\u2113(\u03c4A1)(\u2113!V )\u03d5\u2113(\u03c4A2) T ) +O(\u03c42), (7)\nsince for 2-way tensors (i.e., matrices) 1- and 2- mode products are just the standard matrix-matrix and matrixtranspose matrix multiplications, respectively. Hence, after computing the small sized \u03d5-functions, formula (7) can be efficiently realized with two GEMM calls. Similarly, the generic d-dimensional formulation (6) can be implemented with d GEMM calls as floating point operations, see Reference [5] for more details. Clearly, formula (6) can not be directly employed in formulation (4), since it would lead to an order reduction of the resulting integrator. In the following subsections, we will then look for third order direction split approximations of \u03d5-functions similar to formula (6), in the sense that their realization will require few Tucker operators (that we recall again constitute the major computational cost)."

By writing \u03b72 in terms of \u03b71 from equation (9a), \u03b12 and \u03b22 in terms of \u03b11 and \u03b21 from equations (9b), respectively, we get from (9c) two equations of second degree in \u03b11 and \u03b21 in terms of \u03b71 which give four possible pairs. If we now substitute each pair into equation (9d) we get one equation of degree four in \u03b71 with no admissible solution, one equation of degree four in \u03b71 with two complex conjugate solutions, and two equations of degree one in \u03b71, each of which has one real solution. Backsubstituting gives the coefficients.\nNotice that formula (8) allows for a third order approximation of the \u03d5-functions which, in tensor form, requires the computation of two Tucker operators only (i.e., four matrix-matrix products since we are in a two-dimensional setting).\n2.2. Two terms d-dimensional splitting with complex coefficients\nIn the d-dimensional case we consider an approximation of the form\n\u03d5\u2113(\u03c4(A\u22971+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+A\u2297d)) = \u03b71,d\u03d5\u21131(\u03b11,d\u03c4Ad)\u2297\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2297\u03d5\u21131(\u03b11,1\u03c4A1)+\u03b72,d\u03d5\u21132(\u03b12,d\u03c4Ad)\u2297\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2297\u03d5\u21132(\u03b12,1\u03c4A1)+O(\u03c43), (10) which again can be realized in tensor form with two Tucker operators. Similarly to the previous case, the coefficients have to satisfy the nonlinear system\n\u03b71,d \u21131!d + \u03b72,d \u21132!d = 1 \u2113! (11a)\n\u03b71,d\u03b11,\u00b5 \u21131!d\u22121(\u21131 + 1)! + \u03b72,d\u03b12,\u00b5 \u21132!d\u22121(\u21132 + 1)! =\n1\n(\u2113+ 1)! , \u00b5 = 1, . . . , d (11b)\n\u03b71,d\u03b1 2 1,\u00b5\n\u21131!d\u22121(\u21131 + 2)! +\n\u03b72,d\u03b1 2 2,\u00b5\n\u21132!d\u22121(\u21132 + 2)! =\n1\n(\u2113+ 2)! , \u00b5 = 1, . . . , d (11c)\n\u03b71,d\u03b11,\u00b5\u03b11,\u03bd \u21131!d\u22122(\u21131 + 1)!2 + \u03b72,d\u03b12,\u00b5\u03b12,\u03bd \u21132!d\u22122(\u21132 + 1)!2 =\n2\n(\u2113+ 2)! , \u00b5, \u03bd = 1, . . . , d, \u00b5 < \u03bd. (11d)\nTheorem 2. For \u2113 = 1, 2 and \u21131 = 1 and \u21132 = 2 there exists no real solution to system (11). On the other hand, the solutions of system (11) are given by the complex coefficients in Table 2.\nProof. Since \u21131 = 1 and \u21132 = 2, we have from equation (11a) that \u03b72,d = 2 d ( 1 \u2113! \u2212 \u03b71,d )\n. Substituting in expressions (11b)\u2013(11d), we obtain a set of equations that does not depend anymore on d. Let us then consider, among them, the equations for \u00b5 = \u00b51 and \u00b5 = \u00b52, with \u00b51 6= \u00b52. Their solutions correspond to the ones obtained for the two-dimensional case (see Table 1 for a summary), i.e., \u03b71,d = \u03b71, \u03b72,d = 2\nd\u22122\u03b72, \u03b11,\u00b51 = \u03b11, \u03b11,\u00b52 = \u03b21, \u03b12,\u00b51 = \u03b12, and \u03b12,\u00b52 = \u03b22. This has to be valid for each \u00b51 6= \u00b52, which implies \u03b11,\u00b5 = \u03b11 and \u03b12,\u00b5 = \u03b12, for \u00b5 = 1, . . . , d, and hence excludes the real solutions.\n2.3. Three terms d-dimensional splitting with real coefficients The approximation in the d-dimensional case derived in the previous section required two complex Tucker operators to be computed. Here, we present a formula for d > 2 which works entirely in real arithmetic (for the case d = 2, see Section 2.1). We then write our ansatz as\n\u03d5\u2113(\u03c4(A\u22971 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+A\u2297d)) = \u03b71,d\u03d5\u21131(\u03b11,d\u03c4Ad)\u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 \u03d5\u21131(\u03b11,1\u03c4A1) + \u03b72,d\u03d5\u21132(\u03b12,d\u03c4Ad)\u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 \u03d5\u21132(\u03b12,1\u03c4A1) + \u03b73,d\u03d5\u21133(\u03b13,d\u03c4Ad)\u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 \u03d5\u21133(\u03b13,1\u03c4A1) +O(\u03c43)\n(12)\nand look for the coefficients which satisfy the nonlinear system\n\u03b71,d \u21131!d + \u03b72,d \u21132!d + \u03b73,d \u21133!d = 1 \u2113!

(13d)\nThen, we have the following result.\nTheorem 3. Let \u21131 = \u21133 = 1 and \u21132 = 2. Consider the additional conditions\n\u03b71,d\u03b1 3 1,\u00b5\n4! +\n\u03b72,d\u03b1 3 2,\u00b5 2!d\u221215! + \u03b73,d\u03b1 3 3,\u00b5 4! =\n1\n(\u2113+ 3)! , \u00b5 = 1, . . . , d (13e)\n\u03b71,d\u03b11,\u00b5\u03b11,\u03bd\u03b11,\u03be 2!3 + \u03b72,d\u03b12,\u00b5\u03b12,\u03bd\u03b12,\u03be 2d\u221233!3 + \u03b73,d\u03b13,\u00b5\u03b13,\u03bd\u03b13,\u03be 2!3 = 6 (\u2113+ 3)! , \u00b5, \u03bd, \u03be = 1, . . . , d, \u00b5 < \u03bd < \u03be, (13f)\nwhich correspond to match the terms A3\u2297\u00b5 and A\u2297\u00b5A\u2297\u03bdA\u2297\u03be in the Taylor expansion. Then, for \u2113 = 1 and \u2113 = 2 the coefficients in Table 2 are the only solution of system (13).\nProof. We first consider system (13) in the case d = 3. Then, to determine its solutions we use standard arguments of the Gro\u0308bner basis theory. We assume the lexicographic ordering \u03b11,1 >lex \u03b11,2 >lex \u03b11,3 >lex \u03b12,1 >lex a2,2 >lex \u03b12,3 >lex \u03b13,1 >lex a3,2 >lex \u03b13,3 >lex \u03b71 >lex \u03b72 >lex \u03b73 and \u00b5 = 1, 2, 3. Then, for \u2113 = 1 a Gro\u0308bner basis of the ideal associated to the system is\n{570887639987\u2212 724578693084\u03b73+ 218051991900\u03b723, 12544 + 675\u03b72,\u22122243 + 675\u03b71 + 675\u03b73,\u221245 + 28a2,\u00b5, 6486012633+ 13981255498\u03b13,\u00b5\u2212 12113999550\u03b73,\u221233768359205+ 13981255498\u03b11,\u00b5+ 12113999550\u03b73},\nwhile for \u2113 = 2 is\n{840350\u2212 2453166\u03b73 + 1743039\u03b723, 196 + 27\u03b72,\u221238 + 27\u03b71 + 27\u03b73, 81474 + 73990\u03b13,\u00b5 \u2212 193671\u03b73, \u2212 9 + 7\u03b12,\u00b5,\u2212191100+ 73990\u03b11,\u00b5 + 193671\u03b73}.\nThe desired solutions of system (13) are hence equivalently given by the zeros of the polynomials in the Gro\u0308bner basis. Simple calculations lead to the coefficients summarized in Table 3. Finally, using arguments similar to the ones in the proof of Theorem 2, we get the result for the d-dimensional case.\nRemark 1. As mentioned at the beginning of the section, we focused our attention to \u03d51 and \u03d52 functions only, since the class of integrators that we consider requires at most the latter. Clearly, using a similar approach, one could obtain formulas for different \u2113 and \u2113i."

For both examples, we first perform a semidiscretization in space using second order uniform centered finite differences, with n\u00b5 = n discretization points per direction. Then, for the time marching we consider the third order exponential Runge\u2013Kutta integrator in formula (4) with coefficients c2 = 1 3 , c3 = 2 3 , a32(\u00b7) = 23\u03d52(c3\u00b7), b2(\u00b7) = 0, and b3(\u00b7) = 32\u03d52(\u00b7) (labeled exprk3, see also tableau (5.8) in Reference [6]) in combination with the proposed technique for computing \u03d5-functions. As splitting coefficients we always employ the ones corresponding to the choice of the symbol + in the expression of \u03b11 or \u03b11,\u00b5. Moreover, to compute the needed small sized \u03d5-functions we employ the function phiquad from Reference [2]. The resulting directional split exponential integrator is labeled exprk3ds cplx when employing splitting with complex coefficients, and exprk3ds real when using real ones.\nAs term of comparison we consider the second order directional split integrator proposed in Reference [3] (that we denote etd2rkds), which corresponds to the popular etd2rk scheme (i.e., tableau (5.3) in Reference [6] with c2 = 1) with second order directional splitting of the involved \u03d5-functions. Moreover, we present also the results with the etd2rk and the exprk3 integrators (without directional splitting) where the actions of \u03d5-functions are approximated with a popular and efficient Krylov-based technique [12].\nAll the numerical experiments have been performed on an Intel Core i7-5500U CPU with 12GB of RAM using MathWorks MATLAB\u00ae R2022a, and the code to reproduce the examples (fully compatible with GNU Octave) is publicly available in the GitHub repository https://github.com/cassinif/Expds3."

The results are collected in Figure 1.\nFirst of all, we observe that all the schemes show the expected order of convergence, with a magnitude of the error comparable among the second and third order methods, respectively. The advantage of the proposed technique is neat in terms of simulation wall-clock time. In fact, both the third order directional split integrators perform better than etd2rkds for the range of accuracies under study. Also, as expected the cheapest method among exprk3ds cplx and exprk3ds real is the latter, which overall is the scheme that performs best."
