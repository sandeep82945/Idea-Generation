    "abstractText": "Rationale: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in multiple biological processes, many of which exhibit distinct cell type-specific expression patterns. A miRNA-inducible expression system can be adapted as a signal-on reporter for detecting miRNA activity or as a cell type-specific gene activation tool. However, due to the inhibitory properties of miRNAs on gene expression, few miRNA-inducible expression systems are available, and the available systems are only transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulatory system with obvious leaky expression. Methods: To address this limitation, a miRNA-inducible expression system that can tightly control target gene expression is desirable. Here, by taking advantage of an enhanced LacI repression system and the translational repressor L7Ae, a miRNA-inducible dual transcriptional-translational switch system was designed called the miR-ON-D system. Luciferase activity assay, western blotting, CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry analysis were performed to characterize and validate this system. Results: The results demonstrated that leakage expression was strongly suppressed in the miR-ON-D system. It was also validated that the miR-ON-D system could be used to detect exogenous and endogenous miRNAs in mammalian cells. Moreover, it was shown that the miR-ON-D system could be triggered by cell type-specific miRNAs to regulate the expression of biologically relevant proteins (e.g., p21 and Bax) to achieve cell type-specific reprogramming. Conclusion: This study established a tight miRNA-inducible expression switch system for miRNA detection and cell type-specific gene activation.",

            "text": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that can bind to specific mRNA targets and induce their degradation and/or translational inhibition [1]. Increasing evidence has shown that miRNAs play important regulatory roles in a variety of biological processes, such as differentiation, development, and tumorigenesis [2, 3]. In particular, many miRNAs exhibit distinct cell type-specific\nexpression patterns, and their expression may change dynamically during physical and pathological processes [4]. Additionally, miRNAs are considered biomarkers for a variety of cancer types [5]. Accurate detection of miRNA expression is beneficial for revealing the functions of miRNAs and evaluating their cellular states. However, traditional miRNA detection approaches usually require cell lysis, such\nTheranostics 2023, Vol. 13, Issue 8\nhttps://www.thno.org\n2553\nas northern blotting, microarrays, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR, which cannot reflect the dynamic changes in miRNA expression in living cells [6]. Thus, a reporter for detecting and visualizing miRNA expression in living cells is urgently required. A miRNA-inducible expression system can be adapted as a signal-on reporter for miRNA activity, which is thought to provide a more reliable evaluation of miRNA expression than a signal-off reporter [6-8]. Moreover, based on the cell type-specific expression properties of miRNAs, a miRNA-inducible expression system can be adapted as a cell type-specific gene activation tool for cell type-specific reprogramming. However, owing to the inhibitory properties of miRNAs on gene expression, very few miRNAinducible positive systems are available. A common strategy for constructing miRNAinducible expression systems is to construct a negative-feedback gene circuit [8, 9]. In these circuit systems, after transfecting circuit plasmids into cells, the expression of the target miRNA inhibits the repressor, thereby activating the expression of the gene of interest (GOI). Interestingly, Wang et al. developed a synthetic toehold switch that can be activated by miRNAs and demonstrated its capability for detecting and visualizing miRNA expression in mammalian cells [10]. However, to the best of our knowledge, most of the reported miRNA-inducible expression systems are single-level (transcriptional or post-transcriptional) regulatory systems. Among the synthetic biology systems, single-level regulatory systems usually have some leakage expression, wherein the expression of a GOI is observed in its uninduced state, which often leads to the poor performance of genetic circuits [11-13]. As for miRNA-inducible expression systems, leaky gene expression seriously affects their in vivo applications [14]. For example, once the system is used to regulate the expression of fluorescent proteins, such as GFP, for the visual detection of miRNA, leaky GFP expression results in a high background fluorescence signal. In addition, if the system is used to study the function of a GOI, leaky expression results in the inability to determine whether a phenotype is the result of a threshold response to changes in gene expression. Moreover, the cell type-specific gene activation function of the miRNA-inducible expression system may be impaired due to leaky gene expression. One notable example is that when a cell type-specific miRNA is used to activate toxic gene expression to kill specific cell types, low levels of leaky expression may also lead to non-target cell death, as even faint toxic gene expression may kill host cells [15]. Therefore, a tight miRNA-inducible expression system with low leakage is highly\ndesirable. To this end, in this study, an enhanced LacI repression system, which produces stronger transcriptional repression than the wild-type lac system [16], was taken advantage of to construct a miRNA-inducible transcriptional regulatory system with low leakage expression. A miRNA-inducible translational regulatory system was assembled using the translational repressor L7Ae. Considering that both the transcriptional and translational regulation system may still show obvious leaky expression, the above transcriptional and translational regulatory elements were coupled to develop a dual transcriptional-translational control system (miR-ON-D) that was activated by miRNA (Scheme 1). Leakage expression was strongly suppressed in the miR-ON-D system. It was also shown that the miR-ON-D system could be used to detect exogenous and endogenous miRNAs in mammalian cells. Moreover, the results demonstrated that the miR-ON-D system could effectively inhibit proliferation or induce apoptosis of target cells by activating p21 or Bax expression. This study establishes a tight miRNA-inducible dualregulation switch system for miRNA detection and cell type-specific gene activation and reprogramming."

            "text": "Design and characterization of a miRNA-inducible transcriptional regulation system\nThe LacI repression system is an inducible system established from the lac operon in E. coli, in which the LacI repressor suppresses gene transcription by binding to the lac operator. The LacI repression system has been widely used to construct different types of gene expression systems [17, 18]. Recently, an enhanced LacI repression system was engineered by generating a tight binding LacI mutation [16]. Therefore, here, a low-leakage miRNAinducible gene expression system (LacI-miR-ON) was designed based on enhanced LacI (Figure 1A). To test the feasibility and specificity of the LacI-miR-ON system, Fluc was first chosen as the GOI and a miR21inducible luciferase system, named LacI-miR21ON-Fluc, was constructed (Figure 1B). LacI-miR21ON-Fluc plasmids were transfected into HEK293 cells, which do not express endogenous miR-21, miR-9, or miR-124 [19]. As indicated by Fluc activity, the LacI-miR21-ON-Fluc system was activated by exogenous miR-21 mimics rather than non-target miRNA mimics, such as miR-9 or miR-124 (Figure 1C). In addition, to test whether the LacI-miR21ON-Fluc system could be activated by endogenous target miRNAs, a Ctrl system that did not contain miR-21 target sites compared with the LacI-miR21ON-Fluc system was designed (Figure 1B). Ctrl or LacI-miR21-ON-Fluc (R21-ON) plasmids were transfected into several different cell types. As shown in Figure 1D, there was no significant difference in\nFluc expression in HEK293 cells that did not express endogenous miR-21. In HeLa and HCT116 cells, which express high levels of endogenous miR-21 [8, 20], the expression levels of Fluc were significantly higher when transfected with the R21-ON plasmids than when transfected with the Ctrl plasmids (Figure 1D). These results demonstrated that the LacI-miR21-ON-Fluc system can be activated by endogenous miR-21. Next, the leakage expression of the LacI-miR-ON system was tested. Similar to a previous study, the enhanced lac repression (LacI-Mut) also showed substantially tighter repression than the wild-type (lacI-WT) in the LacI-miR-ON systems, although the enhanced LacI-miR-ON system still showed approximately 5% leakage of expression compared with the control Fluc (Max Fluc) (Figure 1E). It was speculated that leakage could be further inhibited by increasing LacI expression levels. However, when the LacI protein expression levels were increased (Figure 1F), sufficient LacI expression did not further inhibit the leakage of luciferase expression in the system (Figure 1G). Together, these results indicated that the LacI-miR-ON system is effective and can respond specifically to target miRNAs, but it still showed obvious leakage expression, which is similar to other reported transcriptional level regulatory systems.\nOptimization of a dual transcriptional-translational regulation system\nPrevious studies have reported that the coupling of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation could strongly suppress leakage expression in bacteria [13, 15, 21, 22]. Inspired by this, it was speculated that a miRNA-responsive dual transcriptional-translational system could tighter regulate gene expression. To test this hypothesis, a miRNA-inducible translational regulatory system (L7Ae-miR-ON system) was first designed using the RNA-binding protein L7Ae (Figure 1H), which binds with high affinity to the RNA motif known as kink-turn and represses subsequent RNA translation [18, 23, 24]. Using the L7Ae-miR-ON system, an miR21-inducible Fluc expression system (L7AemiR21-ON-Fluc) was constructed and its effectiveness and specificity were verified. As shown in Figure 1I, the luciferase signal was increased only in miR-21-transfected HEK293 cells, but not in miR-9- or miR-124-transfected cells, indicating that miR-21 could induce the activation of the L7Ae-miR21ON-Fluc system. Next, LacI-miR-ON was combined with the L7Ae-miR-ON system to design a miRNA-responsive dual transcriptional-translational system; the miR-ON-D system (Figure 2A). In the miR-ON-D\nTheranostics 2023, Vol. 13, Issue 8\nhttps://www.thno.org\n2556\nsystem, LacI inhibited the transcription of a GOI, whereas L7Ae mediated translational suppression of the leaked transcripts of the GOI, ultimately minimizing leakage expression. In the presence of the target miRNA, the expression of both LacI and L7Ae is inhibited, thereby releasing the transcriptional and translational inhibition of the GOI. To test the\nmiR-ON-D system, an miR-21 inducible Fluc expression system was constructed based on the miR-ON-D system. As expected, the miR-ON-D-based system showed extremely low leakage luciferase expression compared with LacI-miR-ON or Max Fluc (Figure 2B-C).\nTheranostics 2023, Vol. 13, Issue 8\nhttps://www.thno.org\n2557\nA previous study suggested that the insertion of\nmiRNA target sites into both the 5\u2032-UTR and 3\u2032-UTR had a stronger effect than insertion into only one UTR [24]. Thus, three different LacI-L7Ae constructs were designed where miR-21 target sites were inserted into the 5\u2019-UTR (T21-LacI-L7Ae), 3\u2019-UTR (LacI-L7Ae-T21), or both the 5\u2032-UTR and 3\u2032-UTR (T21-LacI-L7Ae-T21) (Figure 2D). As expected, it was found that the three forms of LacI-L7Ae constructs exhibited the same inhibitory effect on Fluc in the miR-ON-D system (Figure 2E). The miR-ON-D system containing miR-21 target sites within both the 5\u2032-UTR and 3\u2032-UTR (T21-LacI-L7Ae-T21) showed the highest fold-change in luciferase activity compared to standard systems containing miR-21 target sites only within the 5\u2032-UTR (T21-L7Ae-LacI) or 3\u2032-UTR (LacI-L7Ae-T21) after miR-21 introduction in HEK293 cells (Figure 2F). Therefore, the miR-ON-D system that contained miRNA target sites within both the 5\u2032-UTR and\n3\u2019-UTR of LacI-L7Ae were focused on in the following studies.\nDetection of the exogenous and endogenous miRNAs in mammalian cells\nIt was expected that the miR-ON-D system could be activated by a target miRNA in a concentrationdependent manner. To test this hypothesis, we transfected miR21-ON-D-Fluc plasmids into HEK293 cells, which do not express endogenous miR-21. It was found that the expression of Fluc increased with an increasing dosage of miR-21 mimics (Figure 3A), indicating that the miR-ON-D system could be used to detect exogenous miRNAs. To test the universality of the miR-ON-D system, a miR-1-inducible Fluc expression system (miR1-ON-D-Fluc) was designed based on the miR-ON-D system. Similar to the miR21-ON-D-Fluc system, when the miR1-ON-D-Fluc plasmids and miR-1 mimics were co-transfected into\nTheranostics 2023, Vol. 13, Issue 8\nhttps://www.thno.org\n2558\nHEK293 cells, the expression of Fluc increased with increasing dosage of miR-1 mimics (Figure 3B). Moreover, the miR21-ON-D-Fluc system in the C2C12 myoblast cell line was examined, which was relatively difficult to transfect. Similar to the results in HEK293 cells, miR21-ON-D-Fluc showed good specificity (Figure 3C) and was activated in a concentrationdependent manner in C2C12 cells (Figure 3D). Next, whether the miR-ON-D system could be used to detect endogenous miRNA expression during cell differentiation was tested. For example, two muscle-specific miRNAs, miR-1 and miR-133, were chosen, the expressions of which were apparent in differentiated myotubes but not in myoblasts [25]. A miR-1- or miR-133-inducible Fluc expression system was constructed based on the miR-ON-D system, named the miR1-ON-D-Fluc or miR133-ON-D-Fluc system, respectively. Notably, when miR1-ON-D-Fluc (Figure 3E) or miR133-ON-D-Fluc (Figure 3F) plasmids were transfected into C2C12 cells, Fluc activity gradually increased over time during C2C12\ncell differentiation, indicating that upregulated miR-1 or miR-133 activated Fluc expression. Together, these results demonstrated that the miR-ON-D system can be used as a reporter to detect both exogenous and endogenous miRNA expression.\nThe miR-ON-D system inhibited the proliferation of specific cell types\nNext, whether the miR-ON-D system could be triggered by cell type-specific miRNAs to regulate the expression of biologically relevant proteins was explored. In this case, p21 (also known as CDKN1, CAP20, or CIP1) was chosen, which suppresses cell proliferation by inhibiting the cell cycle through the cyclin kinase pathway [26, 27]. A miR-21-inducible p21 expression system (R21-ON-p21) was constructed by replacing the luciferase gene with p21 in the miR21-ON-D-Fluc system. The R21-ON-p21 system was tested in HEK293 cells, which did not express endogenous miR21, and in HeLa and HCT116 cells, which expressed high levels of miR-21. As shown in\nTheranostics 2023, Vol. 13, Issue 8\nhttps://www.thno.org\n2559\nFigure 4A-C, exogenous p21 protein with FLAG tags (positive control) could be expressed in these three cell types. However, when transfecting the R21-ON-p21 plasmids into these three different cell types, exogenous p21 was only detected in HeLa and HCT116 cells, indicating that endogenous miR21 activated p21 expression. The CCK-8 assay was performed to determine cell proliferation at various time points. As shown in Figure 4D, there was no significant difference in cell proliferation between the empty vector- and R21-ONp21 plasmid-transfected HEK293 cells. In contrast, when the R21-ON-p21 plasmid was transfected into HeLa (Figure 4E) or HCT116 cells (Figure 4F), cell proliferation was significantly inhibited compared with that of the empty vector. Taken together, these results demonstrated that the miR-ON-D system could be employed to efficiently inhibit the proliferation of specific cell types by activating p21 gene expression.\nThe miR-ON-D system induced cell type-specific apoptotic death\nTo further extend the applicability of the miR-ON-D system, a miR-21-inducible Bax expression system was designed based on the miR-ON-D system named the R21-ON-Bax system. Bax is a member of the Bcl-2 protein family and is associated with apoptotic cell death in both cell cultures and intact\nanimals. Overexpression of Bax in cells can destroy the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and lead to the release of cytochrome c, which leads to apoptosis [28]. Previous studies have shown that low levels of leaky expression are required for inducible expression of toxic proteins [15]. In the present study\u2019s miR-ON-D system, leakage expression was strongly suppressed. Therefore, it is suspected that the R21-ON-Bax system functions as follows. In non-target cells lacking miR-21, Bax expression is almost completely inhibited, thereby producing no toxicity in cells. Bax is expressed in target cells expressing miR-21 at high levels, thereby causing cell death. To test this hypothesis, the R21-ON-Bax system was tested in HEK293 cells (non-target cells), which do not express endogenous miR21, and HeLa cells (target cells), which express high levels of miR-21. As shown in Figure 5A-B, exogenous Bax protein with FLAG tags can be expressed in both HEK293 and HeLa cells. In contrast, when the R21-ON-Bax plasmids were transfected into these two cell types, the expression of the Bax protein was detected only in HeLa cells, indicating that endogenous miR21 induced the activation of Bax. Importantly, the results showed that the R21-ON-Bax plasmid led to apparent cell death in HeLa cells, but not in HEK293 cells (Figure 5C). In addition, to further determine whether the R21-ON-Bax system could selectively kill target\nTheranostics 2023, Vol. 13, Issue 8\nhttps://www.thno.org\n2560\ncells, flow cytometry was performed to detect cell apoptosis under different conditions. As shown in Figure 5D-E, in HEK293 cells, the expression of the R21-ON-Bax plasmid did not induce more apoptosis compared with the empty vector. In contrast, the introduction of the R21-ON-Bax plasmids in HeLa cells resulted in a higher proportion of cell apoptosis than that in the vector control group (Figure 5F-G). Together, these results demonstrated that the R21-ON-Bax system could specifically and efficiently kill cells with high miR21 expression, revealing the superiority and cell type targeting of the miR-ON-D system."
