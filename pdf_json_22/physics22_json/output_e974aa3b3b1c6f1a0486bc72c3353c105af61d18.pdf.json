    "abstractText": "One of the main objectives of quantum error-correction theory is to construct quantum codes with optimal parameters and properties. In this paper, we propose a class of 2-generator quasi-cyclic codes and study their applications in the construction of quantum codes over small fields. Firstly, some sufficient conditions for these 2-generator quasicyclic codes to be dual-containing concerning Hermitian inner product are determined. Then, we utilize these Hermitian dual-containing quasicyclic codes to produce quantum codes via the famous Hermitian construction. Moreover, we present a lower bound on the minimum distance of these quasi-cyclic codes, which is helpful to construct quantum codes with larger lengths and dimensions. As the computational results, many new quantum codes that exceed the quantum GilbertVarshamov bound are constructed over Fq, where q is 2, 3, 4, 5. In particular, 16 binary quantum codes raise the lower bound on the minimum distance in Grassl\u2019s table [7]. In nonbinary cases, many quantum codes are new or have better parameters than those in the literature.",

            "text": "Quantum error-correction codes (QECCs) play a prominent role in the implementation of quantum computing by virtue of they can protect fragile qubits from noises (decoherence). Since the initial work of Shor [1] and Steane [2], the theory of QECCs has developed rapidly. With the efforts of scholars, the connection between QECCs and classical codes has been gradually established, so that the problem of constructing QECCs is transformed into the problem of constructing self-orthogonal or dual-containing classical codes over Fq or Fq2 under different inner products [3\u20136].\nIn [7], Grassl et al. collected the best-known binary QECCs and founded an online code table, which is considered to be the most widely used and most challenging to break one. In addition, Edel et al. [8] cataloged a discrete but more involved online code table, which is an essential comparison for nonbinary QECCs. In this paper, we will provide many QECCs that have better parameters than those in [7] and [8].\nQuasi-cyclic codes are a natural extension of cyclic codes, with rich algebraic structure and excellent properties. In [9], Kasami et al. proved that quasi-cyclic codes satisfy the modified Gilbert\u2013Varshamov bound, i.e., quasicyclic codes are asymptotically good. In addition, a mass of record-breaking classical codes were constructed from quasi-cyclic codes [10\u201313]. In [14], Hagiwara et al. first manipulated quasi-cyclic codes to construct quantum LDPC codes with long lengths. In 2018, Galindo et al. [15] proposed an original method to construct quantum codes employing quasi-cyclic codes, which attracted many authors to devote themselves to the investigation of quasicyclic codes to construct QECCs. Thereby, a series of record-breaking QECCs were constructed by quasi-cyclic codes [16\u201324].\nInspired by the above work, we propose a new method for constructing QECCs via quasi-cyclic codes. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, fundamentals of linear codes and QECCs are introduced. Section 3 presents a class of 2-generator quasi-cyclic codes and their sufficient conditions for dual-containing under Hermitian inner product. In addition, we derive a lower bound on the minimum Hamming distance for the relevant codes. As applications, many new quantum codes over small finite fields are constructed. Conclusions are given in Section 4."

            "text": "A linear code C of length n over Fq2 is an non-empty subset of F n q2 , and can be denoted as [n, k, d]q2 . Let ~u = (u0, . . . , un\u22121) and ~v = (v0, . . . , vn\u22121) be vectors in Fn\nq2 , Hermitian inner product of them can be defined as\n\u3008~u,~v\u3009h = \u2211n\u22121 i=0 (uiv q i ). The weight of ~u, denoted by wt(~u), is the number of nonzero coordinates in ~u. The minimum Hamming distance of C is d(C) = min {wt(~u) | ~u \u2208 C} . The Hermitian dual code of C can be denoted as C\u22a5q = {~v \u2208 Fn\nq2 | \u3008~u,~v\u3009h = 0, \u2200~u \u2208 C}, and parameters of C\u22a5q is [n, n\u2212k, d\u22a5]q2 .\nIf C \u2282 C\u22a5q , then we can say C is a Hermitian self-orthogonal code and C\u22a5q is a Hermitian dual-containing code.\nIf C is closed under a cyclic shift, i.e., for any c = (c0, c1, . . . , cn\u22121) \u2208 C, there will c\u2032 = (cn\u22121, c0, . . . , cn\u22122) \u2208 C, then we can say C is a cyclic code. Define the quotient ring R = F2[x]/ \u3008xn \u2212 1\u3009. If C is generated by a monic divisor g(x) of xn \u2212 1, i.e., C = \u3008g(x)\u3009 and g(x) | xn \u2212 1, then g(x) is called generator polynomial of C. Let gcd(n, q) = 1 and \u2126n = {0, 1, . . . , n\u2212 1} and \u03c2 be a primitive n-th root of unity in some extended fields of Fq2 . Then defining set of C = \u3008g(x)\u3009 can be written as T = { i \u2208 \u2126n | g ( \u03c2i ) = 0 } . If Ci is a q 2- cyclotomic coset modulo n, then it can be denoted as Ci = {i, iq2, . . . , iq2(s\u22121) | i \u2208 \u2126n}, where s is the smallest positive integer satisfied with iq2s \u2261 i mod n. For each i \u2208 \u2126n, the cyclotomic cosets Ci is skew symmetric if n \u2212 qi \u2208 Ci; otherwise it is skew asymmetric. Skew asymmetric cosets Ci and Cn\u2212qi occur in pairs and are called skew asymmetric pairs, abbreviated as (Ci, Cn\u2212qi). If T \u2229 T\u2212q = \u2205 and any two cosets in T cannot form a skew asymmetric pair, then C\u22a5h \u2286 C, i.e., g(x) | g\u22a5q (x).\nIf a cyclic shift of any codeword of C by n positions is also codeword, then C is a quasi-cyclic code. The length of C is nl. The generator matrix of quasicyclic code is composed of circulant matrices. An n\u00d7 n circulant matrix M is defined as\nM =\n\n   \nm0 m1 m2 . . . mn\u22121 mp\u22121 m0 m1 . . . mn\u22122\n... ... ... ... ... m1 m2 m3 . . . m0\n\n    .\nThe generator matrix of a 2-generator quasi-cyclic code with index 2 can be transformed into rows of n\u00d7 n circulant matrices by suitable permutation of columns, which has the following form\nG =\n(\nM1,1 M1,2 M2,1 M2,2\n)\n,\nwhere Mi,j is circulant matrices determined by polynomial mi,j(x), where 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2 and 1 \u2264 j \u2264 2.\nA QECC Q of length n is a K-dimensional subspace of qn-dimensional Hilbert space (Cq)\u2297n, where C represents complex field and (Cq)\u2297n is the nfold tensor power of Cq. Three basic parameters can be used to describe Q: length n, dimension k and minimum distance d, so that Q can be denoted as [[n, k, d]]q, where k = logqK. With [6], there is a relationship between QECCs and classical dual-containing linear codes under Hermitian inner product.\nLemma 1 ([6], Hermitian construction) A Hermitian dual-containing [n, k]q2 linear code C such that there are no vectors of weight less than d in C\\C\u22a5h yields a pure QECC with parameters [[n, 2k \u2212 n, d]]q .\nTypically, QECCs can also be derived from existing ones by the following propagation rules, which will be utilized later.\nLemma 2 ([6], propagation rules) If an [[n, k, d]]q pure QECC exists. Then the following QECCs also exist. (1) [[n, k \u2212 1, d]]q for k \u2265 1; (2) [[n+ 1, k, d]]q for k > 0.\nLike the classical counterpart, one of the central tasks of quantum error correction is to construct QECCs with suitable parameters. When length n and dimension k are fixed, we want to obtain a sizable minimum distance d. Conversely, when minimum distance d is fixed, we want the rate k\nn to be larger.\nSome bounds are helpful to judge the performance of QECCs, among which the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov (GV) bound [25] is widely used.\nLemma 3 ([25], quantum GV bound) Let n > kGV \u2265 2, and n \u2261 kGV (mod 2), d \u2265 2. Then, there exists an [[n, kGV , d]]q pure QECC if the inequality is met.\nqn\u2212kGV +2 \u2212 1\nq2 \u2212 1 >\nd\u22121 \u2211\ni=1\n(\nq 2 \u2212 1\n)i\u22121 (\nn i\n)\n. (1)\nIt is easy to determine that the quantum GV bound illustrates the existence of a class of quantum codes, and quantum codes satisfying inequality (1) exist. By virtue of [25], if k \u2265 kGV holds for certain n and d, i.e. QECC [[n, k, d]]q beats this bound, then it is considered to have excellent parameters."

            "text": "In this section, a family of 2-generator quasi-cyclic codes is presented. We derive the algebraic form of its Hermitian dual codes, which yields sufficient conditions for those quasi-cyclic codes to be dual-containing under Hermitian inner product. In addition, we also deduce a lower bound on the minimum Hamming distance of them. As an application, many new QECCs are constructed via the Hermitian construction.\nLet g(x) = g0 + g1x + g2x + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + gn\u22121xn\u22121 \u2208 R and [g(x)] = [g0, g1, g2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , gn\u22121] represents vectors in Fnq2 determined by the coefficient of g(x) in an ascending order. We also define the following polynomials:\ng\u0304(x) = g0 + gn\u22121x+ gn\u22122x 2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ g1x n\u22121,\ngq(x) = gq0 + g q 1x+ g q 2x+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ g q n\u22121x n\u22121.\nMoreover, let h(x) = (xn \u2212 1)/g(x), then g\u22a5(x) = xdeg(h(x))h ( 1 x ) . The\nHermitian dual code of \u3008g(x)\u3009 is \u2329 g\u22a5q (x) \u232a .\nDefinition 1 Let Cq2(g1, g2, t) be a quasi-cyclic code over Fq2 of length 2n generated by ([t(x)g1(x)], [g1(x)]) and ([g2(x)], [t(x)g2(x)]), where g1(x), g2(x) and t(x) are polynomials in R such that g1(x) | (x n \u2212 1), g2(x) | (x n \u2212 1). Then a generator matrix G of Cq2(g1, g2, t) will have the following form:\nG =\n(\nGT1 G1 G2 GT2\n)\n,\nwhere G1 and G2 are generator matrices of cyclic codes \u3008g1(x)\u3009 and \u3008g2(x)\u3009, respectively. GT1 and GT2 are (n \u2212 deg(g1(x))) \u00d7 n and (n \u2212 deg(g2(x))) \u00d7 n circulant matrices determined by [t(x)g1(x)] and [t(x)g2(x)], separately.\nDefinition 2 Let C0 be a quasi-cyclic code over Fq2 of length 2n, and its generator polynomial pairs are ([\u2212t\u0304q(x)g \u22a5q 1 (x)], [g \u22a5q 1 (x)]) and ([g \u22a5q 2 (x)], [\u2212t\u0304 q(x)g \u22a5q 2 (x)]). Then a generator matrix G0 of C0 will have the following form:\nG0 =\n(\nG\u22a5 T\u03041 G \u22a5 1 G\u22a52 G \u22a5\nT\u03042\n)\n,\nwhere G\u22a51 and G \u22a5 2 are generator matrices of cyclic codes \u3008g \u22a5q 1 (x)\u3009 and \u3008g \u22a5q 2 (x)\u3009, respectively. G\u22a5 T\u03041 and G \u22a5 T\u03042 are deg(g1(x))\u00d7 n and deg(g2(x))\u00d7n circulant matrices determined by [\u2212t\u0304q(x)g \u22a5q\n1 (x)] and [\u2212t\u0304 q(x)g\n\u22a5q 2 (x)], separately.\nLemma 4 ([26], Lemma 1) Let C be a linear code over Fnq2 , then C is self-orthogonal concerning the Hermitian inner product if and only if \u3008c, c\u3009h = 0 for all codewords c of C.\nLemma 5 ([19], Proposition 1) Let f(x), g(x) and h(x) be monic polynomials in R. Then the following equality of Hermitian inner product of vectors in Fnq2 holds:\n\u3008[f(x)g(x)], [h(x)]\u3009h = \u2329 [g(x)], [ fq(x)h(x) ]\u232a\nh .\nTheorem 1 Let Cf and Cg are linear codes with length n, generated by f(x) and g(x), respectively. The sufficient and necessary conditions for \u3008[a(x)f(x)], [b(x)g(x)]\u3009h = 0 to hold for any polynomials a(x) and b(x) in R are g\u22a5q (x) | f(x) and f\u22a5q (x) | g(x).\nProof It is easy to deduce that if g\u22a5q(x) | f(x) and f\u22a5q (x) | g(x), then Cf \u2282 C \u22a5q g and Cg \u2282 C \u22a5q\nf , so \u3008[a(x)f(x)], [b(x)g(x)]\u3009h = 0.\nSimilarly, according to the definition of Hermitian dual code, if \u3008[a(x)f(x)], [b(x)g(x)]\u3009h = 0 holds for any polynomials a(x), b(x) \u2208 R, then Cf \u2282 C \u22a5q g and Cg \u2282 C \u22a5q f , so there is g\u22a5q (x) | f(x) and f\u22a5q (x) | g(x). Therefore, we have finished the proof.\nIn addition, the condition in Theorem 1 can be simplified as g\u22a5q(x) | f(x) for reason that g\u22a5q (x) | f(x) and f\u22a5q(x) | g(x) are equivalent.\nProposition 2 If t (x) can be such that parameters of Cq2(g1, g2, t) and C0 are [2n, 2n\u2212 deg (g1(x))\u2212 deg (g2(x))] and [2n, deg (g1(x)) + deg (g2(x))], respectively. Then the Hermitian dual code of Cq2(g1, g2, t) is C0.\nProof Set c1 = ([a(x)t(x)g1(x) + b(x)g2(x)], [a(x)g1(x) + b(x)t(x)g2(x)]), c2 = ([\u2212c(x)t\u0304q(x)g \u22a5q 1 (x)+d(x)g \u22a5q 2 (x)], [c(x)g \u22a5q 1 (x)\u2212d(x)t\u0304 q(x)g \u22a5q 2 (x)]), where a(x), b(x), c(x), d(x) are arbitrary polynomials in R. Then, any codewords in Cq2(g1, g2, t) and C0 can be represented by c1, c2, respectively. The Hermitian inner product of them \u3008c1, c2\u3009h is equal to\n\u3008[a(x)t(x)g1(x) + b(x)g2(x)], [\u2212c(x)t\u0304 q(x)g \u22a5q 1 (x) + d(x)g \u22a5q 2 (x)]\u3009h +\u3008[a(x)g1(x) + b(x)t(x)g2(x)], [c(x)g \u22a5q 1 (x)\u2212 d(x)t\u0304 q(x)g \u22a5q 2 (x)]\u3009h\n= \u3008[a(x)t(x)g1(x)], [\u2212c(x)t\u0304 q(x)g \u22a5q 1 (x)]\u3009h + \u3008[a(x)t(x)g1(x)], [d(x)g \u22a5q 2 (x)]\u3009h\n+\u3008[b(x)g2(x)], [\u2212c(x)t\u0304 q(x)g \u22a5q 1 (x)]\u3009h + \u3008[b(x)g2(x)], [d(x)g \u22a5q 2 (x)]\u3009h +\u3008[a(x)g1(x)], [c(x)g \u22a5q 1 (x)]\u3009h + \u3008[a(x)g1(x)], [\u2212d(x)t\u0304 q(x)g \u22a5q 2 (x)]\u3009h\n+\u3008[b(x)t(x)g2(x)], [c(x)g \u22a5q 1 (x)]\u3009h + \u3008[b(x)t(x)g2(x)], [\u2212d(x)t\u0304 q(x)g \u22a5q 2 (x)]\u3009h.\nSince \u3008g \u22a5q\ni (x)\u3009, i = 1 or 2, represents Hermitian dual codes of cyclic codes \u3008gi(x)\u3009, so the above formula can be simplified to\n= \u3008[a(x)t(x)g1(x)], [d(x)g \u22a5q 2 (x)]\u3009h + \u3008[b(x)g2(x)], [\u2212c(x)t\u0304 q(x)g \u22a5q 1 (x)]\u3009h +\u3008[a(x)g1(x)], [\u2212d(x)t\u0304 q(x)g \u22a5q 2 (x)]\u3009h + \u3008[b(x)t(x)g2(x)], [c(x)g \u22a5q 1 (x)]\u3009h.\nBy Lemma 5, we have that this equation is equal to zero, so C0 is contained by\nC \u22a5q\nq2 (g1, g2, t). In addition, it is analogous that C\n\u22a5q q2 (g1, g2, t) and C0 have the same\ndimension. Therefore, C0 is Hermitian dual code of C.\nIn fact, there are numerous t(x) that satisfy the condition in Proposition 2, so it is a simple matter to construct Cq2(g1, g2, t) and C0 with parameter [2n, 2n\u2212 deg (g1(x)) \u2212 deg (g2(x))] and [2n, deg (g1(x)) + deg (g2(x))], respectively, during calculation by Magma [27].\nLemma 6 ([19], Proposition 2) Suppose f(x), g(x) are polynomials in R and g(x) | xn \u2212 1. If g\u22a5q(x) | g(x), then quasi-cyclic code generated by (g(x), f(x)g(x)) will be Hermitian self-orthogonal.\nProposition 3 If g1(x) | g \u22a5q 1 (x), g2(x) | g \u22a5q 2 (x), g2(x) | (t(x) + t\u0304 q(x))g \u22a5q 1 (x) and t(x) satisfy Proposition 2, then C0 and Cq2(g1, g2, t) are Hermitian self-orthogonal and Hermitian dual-containing, respectively.\nProof According to Lemma 6, if g1(x) | g \u22a5q 1 (x), g2(x) | g \u22a5q 2 (x), one can deduce that 1-generator quasi-cyclic codes generated by ([\u2212t\u0304q(x)g \u22a5q 1 (x)], [g \u22a5q 1 (x)]) and ([g \u22a5q 2 (x)], [\u2212t\u0304 q(x)g \u22a5q 2 (x)]) are both Hermitian self-orthogonal. Let c1 =\n([\u2212c(x)t\u0304q(x)g \u22a5q 1 (x)], [c(x)g \u22a5q 1 (x)]) and c2 = ([d(x)g \u22a5q 2 (x)], [\u2212d(x)t\u0304 q(x)g \u22a5q 2 (x)]), c(x), d(x) \u2208 R, denote codewords generated by them, respectively. Then, the Hermitian inner product of c1 and c2 can be expressed as follows.\n\u3008c1, c2\u3009h = \u3008[\u2212c(x)t\u0304 q(x)g \u22a5q 1 (x)], [d(x)g \u22a5q 2 (x)]\u3009h + \u3008[c(x)g \u22a5q 1 (x)], [\u2212d(x)t\u0304 q(x)g \u22a5q 2 (x)]\u3009h = \u3008[\u2212c(x)t\u0304q(x)g \u22a5q 1 (x)], [d(x)g \u22a5q 2 (x)]\u3009h + \u3008[c(x)t(x)g \u22a5q 1 (x)], [\u2212d(x)g \u22a5q 2 (x)]\u3009h = \u2212\u3008[c(x)(t(x) + t\u0304q(x))g \u22a5q 1 (x)], [d(x)g \u22a5q 2 (x)]\u3009h.\nBy Theorem 1, one can deduce that if g2(x) | (t(x) + t\u0304 q(x))g\n\u22a5q\n1 (x), then above equation is equal to 0, that is, C0 is Hermitian self-orthogonal. Moreover, since t(x) satisfies Proposition 2, so Cq2(g1, g2, t) is Hermitian dual-containing.\nTheorem 4 Let Cq2(g1, g2, t) be a quasi-cyclic code proposed in Definition 1. If g1(x), g2(x) and t(x) satisfies Proposition 2 and 3, then there exists a pure [[2n, 2n\u2212 2 deg (g1(x))\u2212 2 deg (g2(x)) , d]]q QECC, where d = min {\nwt(~c) | ~c \u2208 Cq2(g1, g2, t) } .\nRemark 1 Let T1 and T2 be defining sets of cyclic codes \u3008g1(x)\u3009 and \u3008g2(x)\u3009, respectively. If T1 \u2229 T \u2212q 1 = \u2205 and T2 \u2229 T \u2212q 2 = \u2205, then g1(x) | g \u22a5q 1 (x) and g2(x) | g \u22a5q 2 (x).\nLet \u03c9 be a primitive element of F4. For simplicity, elements 0, 1, \u03c9, \u03c9 2 in F4 are represented by 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively. To save space, we express coefficient polynomials in ascending order and use indexes of elements to express the same number of consecutive elements. For example, polynomial 1 + x3 + x5 can be written as 102101.\nExample 1 Let q2 = 4 and n = 41. Consider the 4-cyclotomic cosets modulo 41. Select T1 = C1 and T2 = C3 as the defining sets of cyclic codes \u3008g1(x)\u3009 and \u3008g2(x)\u3009. Then g1(x) = 10320102301, g2(x) = 12\n3131231. We choose t(x) = 10203521302223210223010213132203123032. This will generate a [82, 62, 9]4 code, one can verify which is a dual-containing code with respect to Hermitian inner product, whose weight distribution can be written as w(z) = 1 + 5166z9 + 119310z10 + 2263323z11 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + 1209882125048724140018184234z82 . Then a new binary QECC with parameters [[82, 42, 9]]2 can be provided. Observe that a code with parameter [[82, 42, 8]]2 is the best-known binary QECC with length 82 and dimension 42 in [7], so the current record of corresponding minimum distance can be improved to 9.\nWe also obtain a new binary QECCs with parameters [[70, 48, 6]]2 from Theorem 4, which is better than corresponding QECC [[70, 48, 5]]2 that appeared in Grassl\u2019s code tables [7]. Select g1(x) = 1\n23120321, g2(x) = 131, and t(x) = 101212010312330 20130213102203033. A Hermitian dual-containing [70, 59, 6]4 code can be obtained, whose weight distribution is w(z) = 1 + 21945z6 + 638400z7 + 14751240z8 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ 596798778770743310728680969z70.\nMoreover, Theorem 4 is a rigorous method for constructing QECCs but is not a necessity. For g1(x) and g2(x) that do not satisfy the condition Proposition 3, QECCs with good parameters can also be constructed by searching for suitable t(x). We identify conditions that t(x) should satisfy, which help to expand the choice of g1(x) and g2(x) and thus make it more likely to construct new quantum codes.\nTheorem 5 Suppose C is a quasi-cyclic code generated by ([f(x)g(x)], [g(x)]), f(x), g(x) \u2208 R, then the sufficient and necessary condition for C to be Hermitian self-orthogonal is g\u22a5q(x) | (f(x)f\u0304q(x) + 1)g(x).\nProof Let c = ([a(x)f(x)g(x)], [a(x)g(x)]), a(x) \u2208 R. Then any codeword of C can be represented by c. The Hermitian inner product of c can be written as\n\u3008c, c\u3009h = \u3008[a(x)f(x)g(x)], [a(x)f(x)g(x)]\u3009h + \u3008[a(x)g(x)], [a(x)g(x)]\u3009h = \u3008[a(x)f(x)f\u0304q(x)g(x)], [a(x)g(x)]\u3009h + \u3008[a(x)g(x)], [a(x)g(x)]\u3009h = \u3008[a(x)(f(x)f\u0304q(x) + 1)g(x)], [a(x)g(x)]\u3009h\nWith reference to Theorem 1, the sufficient and necessary condition for above equation to be zero is g\u22a5q (x) | (f(x)f\u0304q(x) + 1)g(x). In addition, by Lemma 4, it is easy to deduce that the sufficient and necessary condition for C to be Hermitian selforthogonal is g\u22a5q(x) | (f(x)f\u0304q(x) + 1)g(x).\nTheorem 6 Let Cq2(g1, g2, t) be a quasi-cyclic code proposed in Definition 1. If g2(x) | (t(x)+t\u0304 q(x))g \u22a5q 1 (x), gi(x) | (t(x)t\u0304 q(x)+1)g \u22a5q\ni (x), i = 1 or 2, and t(x) satisfies Proposition 2, then there exists a pure [[2n, 2n\u2212 2 deg (g1(x))\u2212 2 deg (g2(x)) , d]]q QECC, where d = min {\nwt(~c) | ~c \u2208 Cq2(g1, g2, t) } .\nProof By Proposition 3 and Theorem 5, we can deduce that C0 is Hermitian self-orthogonal. In addition, t(x) satisfies Proposition 2, so C0 is a [2n,deg (g1(x)) + deg (g2(x))]q Hermitian self-orthogonal code. By Lemma 1, there exists a pure [[2n, 2n\u2212 2 deg (g1(x))\u2212 2 deg (g2(x)) , d]]q QECC, where d = min {\nwt(~c) | ~c \u2208 Cq2(g1, g2, t) } . So we complete the proof.\nHere we give Examples 2, which satisfy Theorem 6, but not Theorem 4.\nExample 2 Let q2 = 4 and n = 35. Consider the 4-cyclotomic cosets modulo 35. Select T1 = C0 \u222a C1 and T2 = C5 \u222a C7 as the defining sets of cyclic codes \u3008g1(x)\u3009 and \u3008g2(x)\u3009. Then g1(x) = 1 2302321, g2(x) = 12 2031. We choose t(x) = 0322032401223120322122020321032. It is easy to check that g \u22a5q\n1 (x) | g1(x),\ng2(x) | (t(x) + t\u0304 q(x))g\n\u22a5q 1 (x), and gi(x) | (t(x)t\u0304 q(x) + 1)g \u22a5q\ni (x), i = 1 or 2. In addition, one can calculate that parameters of Cg1,g2,t and C0 are satisfy Proposition 2. Therefore, this will generate a Hermitian dual-containing [70, 56, 7]4 code, whose weight distribution can be written as w(z) = 1+10605z7 +242025z8 +4743585z9 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + 9324980918306331190370055z70 . Then a new binary QECC with parameters\n[[70, 42, 7]]2 can be provided. Observe that a code with parameter [[70, 42, 6]]2 is the best-known binary QECC with length 70 and dimension 42 in [7], so the current record of corresponding minimum distance can be improved to 7.\nRemark 2 Two new binary QECCs with parameters [[42, 14, 8]]2, [[170, 148, 5]]2 derived from Theorem 6 are also given here, both of which are better than the corresponding QECCs that appeared in Grassl\u2019s code tables [7]. Their generators and weight distributions are as follows.\n(1) [[42, 14, 8]]2: g1(x) = 1 30120212, g2(x) = 23231 2, and t(x) = 20102 1020122101202123. A Hermitian dual-containing [42, 28, 8]4 code can be obtained, whose weight distribution is w(z) = 1 + 4662z8 + 40152z9 + 345933z10 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + 407672056605z42 .\n(2) [[170, 148, 5]]2: g1(x) = 1 30312231, g2(x) = 1 2, and t(x) = 20123201 35020212021023032022101210223413120332312322121310130122021232230120302. A Hermitian dual-containing [170, 159, 5]4 code can be obtained, whose weight distribution is w(z) = 1+66045z5+5326950z6+373937100z7+\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+3075766749787575402851 57212220447157605514941639416619352831833745300990444z170 .\nFurthermore, by the propagation rules of QECCs in Lemma 2, we can get another 11 new binary QECCs from QECCs above. As shown in Table 1, their parameters also improve the lower bounds on the minimum distance in Grassl\u2019s table [7].\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we also constructed many QECCs over Fq, where q is 3, 4, 5. In particular, they all beat the quantum GV bound and are new or have better parameters than those in the literature. Let \u03b3, \u03be, and \u03b6 be the primitives over F9, F16, and F25, respectively. Elements 0, 1, \u03b3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b37 in F9; 0, 1, \u03be, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03be14 in F16 and 0, 1, \u03b6, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b623 in F25 are represented by 0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 8; 0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 9, A, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , F and 0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 9, A, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , O, respectively. In Tables 2, 3 and 4 are the quasi-cyclic codes over F9, F16 and F25, which are dual-containing under the Hermitian inner product. These codes are used to construct QECCs in Tables 5, 6, and 7.\nHowever, even for supercomputers, it is very difficult to calculate the specific parameters of quasi-cyclic codes of larger length and dimension. Therefore, we give a lower bound on the minimum distance of C(g1, g2, t), which will help to reduce the computational effort.\nTheorem 7 The lower bound on the minimum distance of Cq2(g1, g2, t) is\nd(Cq2(g1, g2, t)) \u2265 min\n\n       \n       \nd(lcm(g2(x), xn\u22121\ngcd(xn\u22121,t(x)) ))\nd(lcm(g1(x), xn\u22121\ngcd(xn\u22121,t(x)) ))\nd(g1(x)) + d(g1(x)t(x)) d(g2(x)) + d(g2(x)t(x)) 2d(gcd(g1(x)t(x), g2(x))) d(gcd(lcm(g1(x), g2(x)\ngcd(g2(x),t(x)) ), lcm(t(x)g2(x), g1(x)t\n2(x))))\nd(gcd(lcm(g2(x), g1(x)\ngcd(g1(x),t(x)) ), lcm(g2(x)t\n2(x), t(x)g1(x)))).\nProof Let a(x), b(x) are polynomials in R. Then any codeword of Cq2(g1, g2, t) can be represented by c = ([a(x)t(x)g1(x) + b(x)g2(x)], [a(x)g1(x) + b(x)t(x)g2(x)]).\nCase (a): If a(x) = 0 and b(x) 6= 0, then c = ([b(x)g2(x)], [b(x)t(x)g2(x)]). (i): If b(x)t(x)g2(x) \u2261 0 (mod x\nn \u2212 1), i.e., xn \u2212 1 | b(x)t(x)g2(x), then xn\u22121\ngcd(xn\u22121,t(x)) | b(x)g2(x). So \u3008b(x)g2(x)\u3009 is a subcode of \u3008 xn\u22121 gcd(xn\u22121,t(x)) \u3009, there will d(Cq2(g1, g2, t)) = d(b(x)g2(x)) \u2265 d(lcm(g2(x), xn\u22121 gcd(xn\u22121,t(x)) )).\n(ii): If b(x)t(x)g2(x) 6= 0 (mod x n \u2212 1), there will d(Cq2(g1, g2, t)) \u2265 d(g2(x)) + d(t(x)g2(x)). Case (b): If a(x) 6= 0 and b(x) = 0, then c = ([a(x)t(x)g1(x)], [a(x)g1(x)]). Similar to Case a, if b(x)t(x)g2(x) \u2261 0 (mod x n \u2212 1), then d(Cq2(g1, g2, t)) \u2265 d(lcm(g1(x), xn\u22121\ngcd(xn\u22121,t(x)) )). Otherwise, d(Cq2(g1, g2, t)) \u2265 d(g1(x)) + d(t(x)g1(x)).\nCase (c): If a(x) 6= 0 and b(x) 6= 0, c = ([a(x)t(x)g1(x)+b(x)g2(x)], [a(x)g1(x)+ b(x)t(x)g2(x)]).\n(i): If a(x)t(x)g1(x) + b(x)g2(x) 6= 0 (mod x n \u2212 1), and a(x)g1(x) + b(x)t(x)g2(x) 6= 0 (mod x n \u2212 1), then \u3008a(x)t(x)g1(x)\u3009 and \u3008b(x)g2(x)\u3009 are subcodes of \u3008gcd(t(x)g1(x), g2(x))\u3009, and \u3008a(x)g1(x)\u3009 and \u3008b(x)t(x)g2(x)\u3009 are subcodes of \u3008gcd(g1(x), t(x)g2(x))\u3009. So d(Cq2(g1, g2, t)) \u2265 d(gcd(t(x)g1(x), g2(x))) + d(gcd(g1(x), t(x)g2(x))) = 2d(gcd(g1(x), t(x)g2(x))).\n(ii): If a(x)t(x)g1(x)+ b(x)g2(x) \u2261 0 (mod x n\u2212 1), a(x)g1(x)+ b(x)t(x)g2(x) 6= 0 (mod xn \u2212 1), then xn \u2212 1 | a(x)t(x)g1(x) + b(x)g2(x). In quotient ring R,\nthere will a(x)t(x)g1(x) \u2261 \u2212b(x)g2(x) (mod x n \u2212 1), so g2(x) | a(x)t(x)g1(x) and\ng2(x) gcd(g2(x),t(x)) | a(x)t(x)g1(x) gcd(g2(x),t(x)) . Since gcd( g2(x) gcd(g2(x),t(x)) , t(x) gcd(g2(x),t(x)) ) = 1, there is g2(x)\ngcd(g2(x),t(x)) | a(x)g1(x), i.e., \u3008a(x)g1(x)\u3009 is subcode of \u3008 g2(x) gcd(g2(x),t(x)) \u3009 and\nd(a(x)g1(x)) \u2265 d(lcm(g1(x), g2(x)\ngcd(g2(x),t(x)) )).\nSimilarly, it follows that g1(x)t 2(x) | b(x)t(x)g2(x), i.e., \u3008b(x)t(x)g2(x)\u3009 is con-\ntained by \u3008g1(x)t 2(x)\u3009 and d(b(x)t(x)g2(x)) \u2265 d(lcm(t(x)g2(x), g1(x)t 2(x))). So d(Cq2(g1, g2, t)) \u2265 d(gcd(lcm(g1(x), g2(x)\ngcd(g2(x),t(x)) ), lcm(t(x)g2(x), g1(x)t\n2(x)))).\n(iii): If a(x)t(x)g1(x) + b(x)g2(x) 6= 0 (mod x n \u2212 1), and a(x)g1(x) + b(x)t(x)g2(x) \u2261 0 (mod x n \u2212 1), then xn \u2212 1 | a(x)g1(x) + b(x)t(x)g2(x). So, in R, one can easy to judge that \u2212a(x)g1(x) \u2261 b(x)t(x)g2(x) (mod x n \u2212 1), which yields g1(x) | b(x)t(x)g2(x) and g1(x)\ngcd(g1(x),t(x)) | b(x)t(x)g2(x) gcd(g1(x),t(x)) . Since\ngcd( g1(x)\ngcd(g1(x),t(x)) , t(x) gcd(g1(x),t(x)) ) = 1, there is g1(x) gcd(g1(x),t(x)) | b(x)g2(x) and\nd(b(x)g2(x)) \u2265 d(lcm(g2(x), g1(x)\ngcd(g1(x),t(x)) )). Moreover, as g2(x)t\n2(x) | a(x)t(x)g1(x)\nand d(b(x)t(x)g2(x)) \u2265 d(lcm(g2(x)t 2(x), t(x)g1(x))), so we have d(Cq2(g1, g2, t)) \u2265 d(gcd(lcm(g2(x), g1(x)\ngcd(g1(x),t(x)) ), lcm(g2(x)t\n2(x), t(x)g1(x)))).\nIn summary, the lower bound on the minimum distance of Cq2(g1, g2, t) is proved.\nHere, we provide two examples to show that the lower bound in Theorem 7 is helpful and feasible to deduce good QECCs.\nExample 3 Let q2 = 4 and n = 133. Consider the 4-cyclotomic cosets modulo 133. Select T1 = C1 \u222a C2 and T2 = C1 \u222a C19 as the defining sets of cyclic codes \u3008g1(x)\u3009 and \u3008g2(x)\u3009. So g1(x) = 1010101\n2031301201, g2(x) = 10\n412313012 . We choose t(x) = 312232213520312213221310103021 3212022121023220232122013120213210420303103213102023203030322120203312202 10212023221302320312203. This will generate a [266, 236]4 code, which can be verified as a dual-containing code concerning Hermitian inner product. Moreover, we have calculated that lower bound on the minimum distance of this code is 6, so there exists a binary QECC with parameters [[266, 206,\u2265 6]]2, which is better than the known [[267, 201, 6]]2 QECC appeared in [8].\nExample 4 Let q2 = 9 and n = 247. Consider the 4-cyclotomic cosets modulo 247. Select T1 = T2 = C1 \u222a C38 as the defining sets of cyclic codes \u3008g1(x)\u3009 and \u3008g2(x)\u3009. Then g1(x) = g2(x) = 176853\n2185651. We choose t(x) = 4012063631256847254226128712782573753675123820676382175372030406702214673 13124324723861206250121203437828323523242320126436824370181582386023428042 8327674218625625608717131470103047165835754305240538702263087502656286378 72532186515304035314263216. This will generate a [494, 470]9 code, which can be verified as a dual-containing code concerning Hermitian inner product. Moreover, we have calculated that lower bound on the minimum distance of this code is 5, so there exists a binary QECC with parameters [[494, 446,\u2265 5]]3, which is better than the known [[494, 440, 5]]3 QECC appeared in [8]."

            "text": "In this paper, we study a class of 2-generator quasi-cyclic codes and provide some sufficient conditions for them to be dual-containing under Hermitian inner product. Furthermore, a lower bound on the minimum distance of these codes is also provided. As an application, many good QECCs over small fields are constructed. In particular, many QECCs are new or have better parameters than those in the literature, so our method of constructing QECCs is valid and feasible.\nHowever, determining the specific parameters of quasi-cyclic codes with large dimensions and lengths is currently a challenging problem, and even with the use of supercomputers, these problems remain cumbersome. Therefore, it will be interesting to investigate more accurate quasi-cyclic code structures and minimize the amount of arithmetic power consumed in the calculation of parameters. We hope that this will attract the interest of scholars in research related to quasi-cyclic codes and together advance this area.\nAcknowledgments.
