    "abstractText": "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key cellular transformation for many physiological and pathological processes ranging from cancer over wound healing to embryogenesis. Changes in cell migration, cell morphology and cellular contractility were identified as hallmarks of EMT. These cellular properties are known to be tightly regulated by the actin cytoskeleton. EMT-induced changes of actin-cytoskeletal regulation were demonstrated by previous reports of cell-cycle-dependent changes of actin cortex mechanics in conjunction with characteristic modifications of cortex-associated factin and myosin. However, at the current state, the changes of upstream actomyosin signalling that lead to corresponding mechanical and structural changes of the cortex are not well understood. In this work, we show in breast epithelial cancer cells MCF-7 that EMT results in characteristic changes of the cortical signalling of Rho-GTPases Rac1, RhoA and RhoC and downstream actin regulators cofilin, mDia1 and Arp2/3. In the light of our findings, we propose that cell-cycle-dependent EMT-induced changes in cortical mechanics rely on two hitherto unknown signalling paths i) a cell-cycle-dependent feedback between Rac1 and RhoC and ii) a negative feedback between Arp2/3 activity and cortical association of myosin II.",

Changes in cell migration, cell morphology and cellular contractility were identified as hallmarks of EMT. These cellular properties are known to be tightly regulated by the actin cytoskeleton. EMT-induced changes of actin-cytoskeletal regulation were demonstrated by previous reports of cell-cycle-dependent changes of actin cortex mechanics in conjunction with characteristic modifications of cortex-associated factin and myosin. However, at the current state, the changes of upstream actomyosin signalling that lead to corresponding mechanical and structural changes of the cortex are not well understood. In this work, we show in breast epithelial cancer cells MCF-7 that EMT results in characteristic changes of the cortical signalling of Rho-GTPases Rac1, RhoA and RhoC and downstream actin regulators cofilin, mDia1 and Arp2/3. In the light of our findings, we propose that cell-cycle-dependent EMT-induced changes in cortical mechanics rely on two hitherto unknown signalling paths - i) a cell-cycle-dependent feedback between Rac1 and RhoC and ii) a negative feedback between Arp2/3 activity and cortical association of myosin II.\n\u2217 Corresponding author: elisabeth.fischer-friedrich@tu-dresden.de\n2"

            "text": "Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular transformation of epithelial cells that entails the loss of apicalbasal cell polarity and intercellular adhesion in combination with a gain of mesenchymal cell traits, see Fig. 1a [1\u20134]. EMT was linked to the initiation of metastasis and bad cancer prognosis through the acquisition of aggressive traits in cancer cells of epithelial origin [1\u20134]. In particular, EMT was reported to be connected to enhanced cell migration and cell proliferation in metastatic cancer cells [1\u20135]. The actin cytoskeleton is a major regulator of cell mechanics, cell shape and cellular force generation. Thereby, the actin cytoskeleton constitutes a key player in cancer-related changes of cell migration and cell division [6\u20138]. Consistent with this, it was found that EMT causes major changes in the actin-cytoskeleton [5, 9, 10]. Rho GTPases are known to be essential regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. We and others showed that EMT is associated with characteristic changes in the activation of Rho GTPases as judged by the abundance of its active GTP-bound forms [5, 11\u201313]. In particular, we reported an increase of total RhoA-GTP and a decrease of total Rac1-GTP upon EMT in MCF-7 breast epithelial cells. Furthermore, the increased expression of the Rho GTPase RhoC was associated to enhanced metastasis in several cancer types [14]. In addition, RhoC signalling was featured to be essential for EMT [13\u201316]. Previously, we reported characteristic EMT-induced cell-cycle-dependent changes of actin cortex mechanics in diverse epithelial cancer cell lines originating from breast, lung, prostate and skin tissue indicating that this EMT-induced cellmechanical change is a widely conserved feature in cells of diverse tissue origin [5, 17, 18]. Cortex-mechanical changes were entailing cortical softening and contractility reduction in interphase but a cortical stiffening and contractility increase upon EMT in mitosis. Concomitantly, we found EMT-induced changes of cortical actin and myosin II with reduced cortical myosin in interphase and increased cortical actin in mitosis [5]. While associated EMT-induced changes in Rho GTPases signalling provide a viable hypothesis for downstream changes of cortical actin and myosin, the details of EMT-induced changes in cortical signalling remain elusive. In particular, it is unclear how cortical mechanics is affected in an opposite way in interphase and mitosis, as none of the downstream actomyosin effectors of Rho GTPases is known to exhibit cell-cycle-dependent mechanical effects on the cortex [19, 20]. With this work, we aim to deepen our understanding of EMT-induced changes in cortical signalling, cortical composition and cortical mechanics with a focus on the differences between interphase and mitosis. To this end, we quantify EMT-induced changes of Rho GTPases RhoA, RhoC and Rac1 which were previously linked to EMT. Furthermore, we investigate as actin-regulating downstream targets formin, Arp2/3 and cofilin. In particular, we provide a quantitative analysis of EMT-induced changes of cortical protein localization in combination with changes of protein expression and cortical mechanics. We propose that two hitherto unknown signalling mechanisms at the cortex are at the heart of the cell-cycle dependent changes in cell mechanics - i) a signalling feedback between Rac1 and RhoC and ii) a feedback between Arp2/3 signalling at the cortex and myosin II cortical localization."

We and others showed previously that in response to this treatment, MCF-7 cells displays an EMT-characteristic protein expression change, corresponding cell-morphological changes, as well as increased proliferation and migration, see e.g. [5, 21]. In order to investigate cortical signalling of diverse cortical regulator proteins, we chose to assess cortical signalling via cortical association of the respective regulator under consideration. For cortical imaging, we decided to work with suspended cells in order to remove cortical polarization and inhomogeneities induced through cell adhesion. Immunostaining of the cortical regulator under consideration was combined with fluorescent DNA staining (DAPI or Hoechst) which allowed to identify cells to be in an interphase or mitotic stage, see Materials and Methods. For the measurement of cortical regulators in mitotic cells, the fraction of mitotic cells was enriched via STC-induced mitotic arrest, see Materials and Methods. Using a previously established image analysis scheme, we analysed confocal images of immunostaining fluorescence intensities to infer the cellular outline and the averaged cortical fluorescence profile along the radial coordinate, i.e. orthogonal to the cell boundary, see Fig. 1b and [5, 18]. The averaged radial fluorescence intensity was then used to derive the cortex-to-cytoplasm ratio of protein localization in the cells by calculating the ratio of the cortical fluorescence contribution and the cytoplasmic fluorescence signal, see Fig. 1c and [5, 18]. The cortex-to-cytoplasm ratio was then used and interpreted as a quantitative readout of cortical association and signalling activity.\n3"

            "text": "To investigate whether cortical signalling of Rho GTPases changes through EMT, we quantified the cortex-tocytoplasm ratio of RhoA, RhoC and Rac1 in cells with and without EMT induction. To this end, we performed confocal imaging of the equatorial cross section of suspended interphase or STC-arrested mitotic cells which were immunostained for either of the Rho GTPases under consideration, see Fig. 1d and Materials and Methods. Quantitative analysis shows that the cortex-to-cytoplasm ratio of Rac1 increases upon EMT both in interphase and mitosis (Fig. 1d,e). By contrast, the cortex-to-cytoplasm ratio of RhoA decreases through EMT (Fig. 1d,f). We conclude that cortical signalling of Rac1 and RhoA follows the EMT-induced quantitative change of GTP-bound Rac1 and RhoA in whole-cell-lysates of MCF-7 cells [5], corroborating previous results that activation of either of the two proteins is connected to localization to the plasma membrane and increased cortical signalling [22\u201325]. The cortex-to-cytoplasm ratio of RhoC changes in a cell-cycle-dependent manner upon EMT. While cortical RhoC goes down in interphase, we see an increase of cortical RhoC in mitosis (Fig. 1d,g). Our results on the effect of EMT on cortical signalling of Rho GTPases is summarized in Fig. 1h. We further asked about the influence of Rho GTPases on cortical mechanics. For this purpose, we relied on cortexmechanical measurements with an established cell confinement setup based on oscillatory cell-squishing with the cantilever of an atomic force microscope (AFM). We chose a deformation frequency of 1 Hz. This assay was previously shown to provide a readout of cortical stiffness, cortical tension as well as a characterization of the viscoelastic nature of the cortex quantified by the phase shift between stress and strain [5, 17, 18, 26]. (The phase shift takes values between 0\u2212 90\u25e6 with lower values corresponding to a more solid-like response). In particular, we previously showed that Rac1 signalling was linked to a decrease in cortical stiffness and contractility in interphase cells but to an increase of cortical stiffness and contractility in mitotic cells with a stronger effect in post-EMT cells [5]. This is in agreement with our here reported finding of increased cortical Rac1 signalling post-EMT (Fig. 1f). On the other hand, we previously found that RhoA signalling increases cortical stiffness and contractility in particular in pre-EMT cells [5]. Again, the bigger mechanical effect pre-EMT is in agreement with our current observation of higher cortical RhoA signalling pre-EMT (Fig. 1e). The effect of RhoC on cortical mechanics has to our knowledge not been reported previously. Using the AFM-based cell confinement assay, we measured cortical mechanics with and without RhoC knock-down via RNA interference in pre- and post-EMT conditions, see Fig. 1i-l, S1 and S2 and Materials and Methods. We find that similar to RhoA, RhoC signalling increases cortical contractility and stiffness, see Fig. 1i-l. However, this effect is restricted to pre-EMT interphase cells and post-EMT mitotic cells. It is plausible that the absence of an effect in these conditions is linked to low cortical RhoC signalling (Fig. 1g). Furthermore, RhoC knock-down increases the phase shift in pre-EMT interphase conditions indicating that RhoC signalling contributes to the solid-like nature of the cortex in interphase, see Fig. S1b."

            "text": "The previously reported finding that Rac1 activity affects cortical mechanics opposite in interphase and mitosis provides a clue that the signalling of Rac1 might be at the heart of the cell-cycle dependence of cytoskeletal changes upon EMT. However, currently it is unclear how cortical Rac1 signalling can act in a manner that is qualitatively different in interphase and mitosis. In particular, it surprised us that Rac1 would make a strong contribution to cortical contractility in mitosis in post-EMT conditions given that Arp2/3 activity increase downstream of Rac1 is expected to diminish cortical contractility, see Fig. 6 and [20, 27]. Furthermore, previous reports showed that RhoA is at the heart of cortical contractility in mitosis [25]. While RhoA signalling is low in post-EMT MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1f and [5]), we note that RhoC signalling is similar to RhoA. Therefore, RhoC signalling might step in for RhoA signalling after EMT during mitosis. Following this line of thought, we asked whether Rac1 might increase cortical contractility in post-EMT mitosis via (direct or indirect) activation of RhoC. To test this hypothesis, we monitored changes in cortical localization of RhoC upon knock-down of Rac1 in pre- and post-EMT conditions judged by fluorescence intensity of RhoC immunostaining (Fig. 2a). Obtained confocal images of equatorial cross-sections were used for image analysis in all conditions. We find that inferred cortex-to-cytoplasm ratios of RhoC increase upon knock-down of Rac1 in interphase with a stronger effect in post-EMT conditions (Fig. 2c). By contrast, the cortex-to-cytoplasm ratio of RhoC decreases upon knockdown of Rac1 in interphase with a stronger effect in post-EMT conditions (Fig. 2d). We conclude that Rac1 signalling increases cortical activity of RhoC in mitosis but diminishes cortical activity in interphase in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2g). To test whether in return also RhoC signalling influences Rac1, we performed immunostaining of Rac1 with and without RhoC knock-down in pre- and post-EMT conditions in interphase and mitosis, see Fig. 2b and Fig. S2. We find that inferred cortex-to-cytoplasm ratio of Rac1 decreases upon knock-down of RhoC in pre-EMT interphase cells and in post-EMT mitotic cells (Fig. 2c). In all other conditions, there is no significant effect on RhoC cortical signalling (Fig. 2c). We conjecture that the reverse signalling from RhoC to Rac1 is restricted to pre-EMT, interphase and post-EMT, mitosis due to the low cortical representation of RhoC in post-EMT, interphase and pre-EMT, mitotic\n4 conditions, see Fig. 1g,h. With this explanation approach, our data are consistent with a general positive feedback signalling of RhoC to Rac1 (Fig. 2g). In previous work, the active forms of RhoA and Rac1 were shown to affect each other through mutually inhibitory feedback in breast epithelial cells [28]. This is consistent with the EMT-induced switch-like change from a state of high RhoA and low Rac1 activation to a state of low RhoA and high Rac1 activation [5]. The cell-cycle dependent feedback between Rac1 and RhoC has been to our best knowledge unknown so far."

            "text": "We went on to ask how EMT-induced changes in Rho GTPases signalling affect downstream cortical regulators. We first investigated EMT-induced changes of cofilin signalling. Cofilin is known to promote the depolymerization of the actin cortex through severing of actin fibers [29]. In the context of cancer, cofilin signalling at the cortex has been suggested to be a main factor in f-actin turnover thus playing a key role in cancer cell migration and invasion [30]. Cofilin becomes deactivated through phosphorylation mediated by Lim kinases [30] Quantifying amounts of total cofilin (CFL1) and phospho-cofilin (phospho-CFL1 (Ser3)) via western blotting, we find a trend of a shallow increase of total cofilin (only interphase) and a decrease of phospho-cofilin upon EMT, see Fig. 3a-c and Materials and Methods. Taken together, this points at an increase of the active non-phosphorylated form of cofilin upon EMT in MCF-7. To assess cortical signalling of cofilin, we performed also cofilin-immunostaining of suspended cells, see Fig. 3d. Using immunostaining, we find that the cortex-to-cytoplasm ratio of cofilin is increased upon EMT indicating an EMTmediated increase of cortical cofilin signalling, see Fig. 3d,e. This finding is in agreement with an increase of active cofilin as suggested by western blotting. Immunostaining of the cofilin upstream regulator phospho-Limk1 (phospho-LIMK1 (Thr508)) shows no cortical association but cytoplasmic localization in agreement with previous findings, see Fig. S3a and [31]. Quantifying phosphoLimk1 abundance in whole-cell lysates via western blotting, we find an EMT-induced decrease in interphase (asynchronous cell population) in accordance with the observed concomitant decrease of phospho-cofilin, see Fig. 3a-c and Materials and Methods. In mitosis, phospho-Limk1 amounts are very low and show a trend of decrease upon EMT which is, surprisingly, in disagreement with the EMT-induced trend of phospho-cofilin (Fig. 3a-c). We speculate that this apparent inconsistency may be attributed to the previously reported modified activation scheme of Limk1 in mitosis, where hyperphosphorylation rather than phosphorylation at Thr508 is at the heart of Limk1 activation [32]. This observation features phospho-Limk1 (Thr508) as an unsuitable readout of cofilin phosphorylation activity in mitosis. Investigating the effect of cofilin cortical signalling on cortical mechanics, we find that cofilin knock-down through RNA interference changes cortical mechanics, see Fig. 3f-i and Fig. S3b-h. Both cortical tension and stiffness increase in interphase and mitosis, see Fig. 3f-i. In addition, the phase shift and therefore the fluid-like nature increased mildly upon knock-down in interphase cells, see Fig. S3f. We conclude that increased cortical signalling of cofilin in EMT-induced cells contributes to a trend of decreased cortical contractility and stiffness."

            "text": "In order to understand changes of cortex-associated actin upon EMT [5], we further addressed how actin nucleators are affected upon EMT downstream of Rho GTPases. To that end, we first focused on the formin representative mDia1 (also Diaph1) which together with the actin nucleator Arp2/3 polymerizes the majority of f-actin in the actin cortex [33]. mDia1 is activated downstream of RhoA, RhoB or RhoC through binding to the active form of the respective Rho GTPase [34]. In particular, we therefore expect that mDia1 signalling is modified through cortical signalling of RhoA and RhoC. Performing quantification of protein amounts in whole-cell lysates via western blots, we find that there is no significant change of expression of mDia1 upon EMT (Fig. 4a-c). We then went on to monitor cortical signalling activity of mDia1 via immunoblotting and quantification of the cortex-to-cytoplasm ratio, see Fig. 4d. We find clear EMTinduced changes; in interphase cells, the cortex-to-cytoplasm ratio of mDia1 is reduced, see Fig. 4e, blue boxes. We conclude that cortical signalling of mDia1 is decreased upon EMT in agreement with our finding of reduced RhoA and RhoC cortical signalling. In mitotic cells, on the other hand, the cortex-to-cytoplasm ratio of mDia1 is increased, see Fig. 4e, yellow boxes. This finding points at an increase of cortical mDia1 signalling upon EMT in mitosis. We suggest that this effect is due to enhanced cortical signalling of RhoC in mitosis upon EMT overcompensating the effect of reduced RhoA signalling in mitosis, see Fig. 1h. We further addressed how changes in cortical formin signalling affects cortical mechanics. Previous studies have shown that mDia1 signalling increases cortical contractility [19, 20]. To test the influence of formin signalling on cortical mechanics also in MCF-7, we quantified formin-inhibition induced changes on cortical mechanics with the AFM-based cell confinement setup with and without the formin inhibitor SMIFH2, see Fig. 4f-i and Fig. S4. We find that, as expected on the basis of previous results [19, 20], formin inhibition reduces cortical stiffness and contractility\n5 in MCF-7 cells in interphase and mitosis, see Fig. 4f-i. In addition, formin inhibition increased the phase shift and thus the fluid-like nature of the cortical material in mitotic cells, see Fig. S4d. Our results suggest that cell-cycle-dependent changes of cortical mDia1 signalling upon EMT are likely a major contributor to cell-cycle-dependent changes of cortex-associated actin and cortical mechanics."

            "text": "To further increase our understanding of changes in cortex-associated actin upon EMT as reported in [5], we also investigated signalling changes of the second major actin nucleator beyond mDia1, namely the Arp2/3 complex [6, 33]. The Arp2/3 complex becomes activated by the Wasp family of proteins [35]. Wasp by itself is activated downstream of Rac1 [36]. We therefore expect that our finding of EMT-induced increase of cortical Rac1 signalling (Fig. 1h) should give rise to a downstream increase of cortical Arp2/3 signalling. Performing protein quantification in whole-cell lysates, we find that there are no significant expression changes of Arp2 upon EMT, see Fig. 5a-c. This indicates that there are no significant changes of the amount of the Arp2/3 complexes in MCF-7 cells upon EMT induction. To assess cortical signalling of the Arp2/3 complex, we performed immunostaining of Arp2 in suspended cells in interphase and mitosis, see Fig. 5d. Interestingly, in spite of a direct interaction between Arp2/3 and f-actin, a cortical enrichment of Arp2 is only visible in interphase cells, see Fig. 5d, lower row. Quantification of corresponding cortical association in interphase via the cortex-to-cytoplasm ratio indicates that Arp2/3 signalling at the cortex is enhanced through EMT, see Fig. 5e. Previous studies reported that Arp2/3 signalling reduces cortical tension in interphase and mitosis [27, 37]. This is counter-intuitive as Arp2/3 mediates actin polymerization and, thereby, could be expected to increase the amount of cortical myosin II substrate. A study by Truong Quang et al. suggested that the the emergent branched f-actin structures generated by Arp2/3 activity might prevent myosin II from effective cortical penetration such that myosin activity is impeded. To test the effect of Arp2/3 signalling on cortical tension in MCF-7 cells, we measured actin cortical mechanics with and without the Arp2/3 inhibitor CK666, see Fig. 5f-i and Fig. S5. We find that in agreement with previous results, cortical tension and stiffness increases upon Arp2/3 inhibition in interphase and mitosis, see Fig. 5f-i. By contrast, the phase shift did not change significantly upon Arp2/3 inhibition, see Fig. S5c,d. We conclude that increased Arp2/3 signalling upon EMT downstream of increased Rac1 activity tends to reduce cortex stiffness and contractility independent of the cell cycle state."

            "text": "To deepen our understanding of cortical response to EMT-induced Arp2/3 signalling changes, we investigated how cortex-associated actin and myosin change in response to Arp2/3 inhibition. For this purpose, we transfected MCF-7 cells with constructs expressing fluorescently labeled myosin regulatory light chain (MLC2) or fluorescently labeled actin (ACTB) as fluorescent reporters of cellular myosin II and actin localization, see Fig. 6a and Materials and Methods. Cell transfection was performed for suspended cells in interphase and mitosis as well as in pre- and post-EMT conditions, see Materials and Methods. Quantifying cortical association of myosin II and actin via confocal imaging of transfected live cells, we determined the cortex-to-cytoplasm ratio of actin and myosin II in conditions with and without Arp2/3 inhibition via the inhibitor CK666. As expected, we find that cortical actin association goes down upon Arp2/3 inhibition in all conditions, see Fig. 6b. By contrast, we observe that Arp2/3 inhibition increases myosin II association to the cortex in all conditions in spite of reduction of cortical actin. To further corroborate these findings, we double-checked the observed effect of Arp2/3 signalling in fixed cells using Phalloidin as a fluorescent reporter of f-actin and immunostaining of MYH9 as a fluorescent readout of myosin II localization, see Fig. S6. Again, we see that Arp2/3 inhibition leads to diminished cortical f-actin in combination with an increase in cortical myosin II confirming our results obtained from transfected live cells, see Fig. S6b,c. We conclude that cortical Arp2/3 signalling in addition to expected allocation and polymerization of cortical actin leads to diminished cortical association of myosin II. Enhanced Arp2/3 signalling downstream of enhanced Rac1 cortical signalling upon EMT may therefore, at least in part, account for the observation of emergent reduced cortical tension and stiffness as well as reduced myosin II cortex-to-cytoplasm ratios upon EMT in interphase cells [5]."

            "text": "In this study, we investigated how actin cortex regulation is changed upon EMT in MCF-7 breast epithelial cancer cells. As previous work suggested that activity changes of the Rho GTPases are a game changer of cytoskeletal regulation upon EMT [5, 13, 28, 38\u201340], we focused on modulations of cortical signalling of RhoA, RhoC and Rac1\n6 as well as on selected downstream effectors. Signalling of cortical regulator proteins was assessed through immunostaining and subsequent confocal imaging of fixed MCF-7 breast epithelial cells in a non-adherent state with a largely uniform cortex. The magnitude of the inferred cortex-to-cytoplasm ratio of the regulator protein under consideration was used as a measure of cortical signalling. In particular, we compared cortex-to-cytoplasm ratios in control and EMT-induced conditions in interphase and mitosis. Furthermore, for cortical regulators RhoC, formin, Arp2/3 and and cofilin, we identified their influence on cortical mechanics which was quantified by an established AFM-based cell confinement setup [5, 17, 18, 26]. In summary, we found that EMT reduces cortical signalling of RhoA but enhances cortical signalling of Rac1, while RhoC signalling is subject to a cell-cycle-dependent change, see Fig. 1h and Fig. 7. Interestingly, we discovered a hitherto unappreciated signalling feedback between RhoC and Rac1 that likely contributes to RhoC activation in mitotic EMT-induced cells, see Fig. 2g. This feedback entails in particular a reduction of cortical RhoC in interphase but an increase of cortical RhoC in mitosis through Rac1 signalling. Downstream of Rho GTPases, we found that also the cortical signalling of the formin mDia1 is affected in a cellcycle-dependent manner by EMT. mDia1 decrease at the EMT-transformed interphase cortex can be attributed to decreased RhoA and RhoC signalling. On the other hand, we conjecture that the EMT-related increase of mitotic RhoC signalling contributes to EMT-induced enhancement of mDia1 at the mitotic cortex, see Fig. 7. Furthermore, we find an EMT-induced increase in Arp2/3 and cofilin signalling at the cortex in both interphase and mitosis, see Fig. 7. Taken together, our study indicates that actin nucleation at the interphase cortex is promoted upon EMT through upregulation of Arp2/3, but diminished through downregulation of mDia1 and enhanced cofilin signalling at the cortex. All in all, these signalling changes may give rise to the observed absence of a net change of cortex-associated actin in interphase, see Fig. 6b and [5]. Furthermore, myosin activity at the interphase cortex is diminished through reduced RhoA and RhoC signalling (via Rock) and via increased Rac1 signalling (mediated downstream by Arp2/3, see Fig. 6d). The combined effects can account for the observed net decrease of cortex-associated myosin upon EMT and can be causative to cortical stiffness and contractility reduction, see Fig. 7. In mitotic cells, cortical actin nucleation is promoted through enhanced cortical RhoC signalling (e.g. via mDia1) and enhanced Rac1 signalling (via Arp2/3). On the other hand, cortical actin is diminished through reduced cortical RhoA signalling and enhanced cofilin signalling. The integration of all signalling changes can account for the observed net increase of cortical actin upon EMT in mitosis, see Fig. 6d and [5]. Myosin activity at the mitotic cortex is promoted through enhanced RhoC signalling, but diminished through reduced RhoA signalling and via increased Rac1 signalling (mediated downstream by Arp2/3 signalling, see Fig. 6d). Through the combination of these opposite effects, the net change of cortical myosin II may vanish as was observed in MCF-7 cells, see Fig. 7. In conclusion, our work provides new insight into how EMT changes actin cortex regulation and how cell-cycledependent differences emerge in cortical composition and mechanics. Our results thereby give a new perspective on the role of EMT in cellular processes that rely on the actin cytoskeleton such as cell migration and cell shape regulation.\n10\n11\n12\n13"

To prepare AFM measurements of suspended interphase cells, cell culture dishes (fluorodish FD35-100) and wedged cantilevers were plasma-cleaned for 2 minutes and then coated by incubating the dish at 37\u25e6C with 0.05 mg/mL poly(L-lysine)-polyethylene glycol dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 37\u25e6C (poly(L-lysine)(20)-g[3.5]-polyethylene glycol(2); SuSoS, Dubendorf, Switzerland) to prevent cell adhesion. Before measurements, cultured cells were detached by the addition of 0.05 trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen). Approximately 30,000 cells in suspension were placed in the coated culture dish. Upon resuspension, the culture medium was changed to CO2-independent DMEM (PN:12800-017; Invitrogen) with 4 mM NaHCO3 buffered with 20 \u00b5M HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.2), for AFM experiments \u223c2 hours before the measurement [17, 41\u201343]. The experimental setup included an AFM (Nanowizard I; JPK Instruments, Carpinteria, CA) that was mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M optical, wide-field microscope using a 20x objective (Plan Apochromat, NA = 0.8; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) along with a CCD camera (DMK 23U445 from The Imaging Source, Charlotte, NC). Cell culture dishes were kept in a petri-dish heater (JPK Instruments) at 37\u25e6C during the experiment. Before every experiment, the spring constant of the cantilever was calibrated by thermal noise analysis (built-in software; JPK) using a correction factor of 0.817 for rectangular cantilevers [44]. The cantilevers used were tipless, 200-350 \u00b5m long, 35 \u00b5m wide, and 2 \u00b5m thick (CSC37, tipless, no aluminum; Mikromasch, Sofia, Bulgaria). The nominal force constants of the cantilevers ranged between 0.2 and 0.4 N/m. The cantilevers were supplied with a wedge, consisting of UV curing adhesive (Norland 63; Norland Products, East Windsor, NJ) to correct for the 10\u25e6 tilt [45]. The measured force, piezo height, and time were output with a time resolution of at least 500 Hz. Dynamic AFM-based cell confinement. Preceding every cell compression, the AFM cantilever was lowered to the dish bottom in the vicinity of the cell until it touched the surface and then retracted to \u224814 \u00b5m above the surface. Subsequently, the free cantilever was moved and placed on top of the cell. Thereupon, a bright-field image of the equatorial plane of the confined cell was recorded to evaluate the equatorial radius Req at a defined cell height h. Cells were confined between dish bottom and cantilever wedge. Then, oscillatory height modulations of the AFM cantilever were carried out with oscillation amplitudes of 0.25 \u00b5m at a frequency of 1 Hz. During this procedure, the cell was on average kept at a normalized height h/D between 60 and 70%, where D = 2(3/(4\u03c0)V )1/3 and V is the estimated cell volume. Using molecular perturbation with cytoskeletal drugs, we could show in previous work that at these confinement levels, the resulting mechanical response of the cell measured in this setup is dominated by the actin cortex (see Figure 4 in [42] and Figure S7 in [5]). This is further corroborated by our observation from previous work that the smallest diameter of the ellipsoidal cell nucleus in suspended interphase cells is smaller than 60% of the cell diameter (see Figure S4 in [17]). Additionally, it has been shown that for a nucleus-based force response, when measuring cells in suspension with AFM, a confinement of more than 50% of the cell diameter is needed [46]. Data analysis. The data analysis procedure was described in detail in an earlier work [42]. In our analysis, the force response of the cell is translated into an effective cortical tension \u03b3 = F/[Acon(1/R1 + 1/R2)], where Acon is the contact area between confined cell and AFM cantilever and R1 and R2 are the radii of principal curvatures of the free surface of the confined cell. Here R1 is estimated as half the cell height h and R2 is identified with the equatorial radius Req [17, 41, 42]. Cell height h and equatorial radius Req were estimated from the AFM readout and optical imaging, respectively [26]. For the determination of the radius of the contact area Acon, see also Supplementary Section 5 in [47]. Oscillatory force and cantilever height readouts were analyzed in the following way: for every time point, effective cortical tension \u03b3 and surface area strain \u03f5(t) = (A(t)\u2212 < A >)/ < A > were calculated. Here, A(t) is the total surface area of the confined cell. It is estimated as the area of a rotationally symmetric body with semi-circular free-standing side walls at cell height h and equatorial radius Req , i.e. A = \u03c0(2h(Req \u2212h/2)(\u03c0/2\u22121)+h2/2+2R2eq) [17]. An amplitude and a phase angle associated to the oscillatory time variation of effective tension \u03b3 and surface area strain are extracted by sinusoidal fits. To estimate the value of the complex elastic modulus at a distinct frequency, we determine the phase angles \u03c6\u03b3 and \u03c6\u03f5 as well as amplitudes A\u03b3 and A\u03f5 of active cortical tension and surface area strain, respectively. The complex elastic modulus at this frequency is then calculated as A\u03b3/A\u03f5 exp(i(\u03c6\u03b3 \u2212 \u03c6\u03f5)). Statistical analyses of cortex mechanical parameters were performed in MATLAB using the commands \u201cboxplot\u201d and \u201cranksum\u201d to generate boxplots and determine p-values from a Mann-Whitney U-test (two tailed), respectively."
