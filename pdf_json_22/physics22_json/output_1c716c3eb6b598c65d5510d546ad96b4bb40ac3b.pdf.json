The ability to generate an increasing number of entangled particles is an essential benchmark for quantum information processing. In past decades, considerable efforts have been made to prepare larger and more complex entangled states in various platforms [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], which experimental systems are currently evolving from several qubits to noisy intermediate scale quantum system (NISQ) [15].\nThe developments of quantum technologies raise immediately important questions regarding characterization of quantum entanglement of underlying systems. In bipartite systems, various theoretical works have been contributed, such as separability criterions [16, 17, 18, 19] and entanglement measures [20, 21, 22], which provide standard tools for\nLi Li: eidos@ustc.edu.cn Nai-Le Liu: nlliu@ustc.edu.cn Kai Chen: kaichen@ustc.edu.cn\nar X\niv :2\n21 1.\n05 56\n3v 1\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n1 0\nN ov\n2 02\n2\ncharacterizing bipartite entanglement. For good reviews, please refer to Refs. [1, 23, 24]. When it comes to multipartite systems, the problem is much more complicated. The entanglement structure becomes much richer for multipartite systems [25, 26], since the number of possible divisions grows exponentially with the system size [1]. This leads to many types of multipartite entanglement, ranging from non-fully-separable to genuine multipartite entanglement (GME). In the following, we focus on the detection of genuine multipartite entanglement, which is an essential task for multipartite quantum communication and quantum computing tasks. For the detection of GME, many standard tools in the bipartite case, such as separability criterions, become infeasible since they only detect entanglement between two partitions. Meanwhile, a tomographic reconstruction of quantum state required in these methods becomes time-consuming and computationally difficult in the multipartite case.\nFor genuine multipartite entanglement detection, entanglement witness (EW) [27, 28, 29, 30, 31] provides an elegant solution both theoretically and experimentally without need of having full tomographic knowledge about the state. Moreover, it is also known that witness operator can also be used to estimate entanglement measures [32]. On account of simplicity and efficiency of entanglement witness, it has been widely used for experimental certification of GME in many platforms, such as trapped ions [33, 34], photonic qubits [35, 36, 37, 38], and superconducting qubits[39]. Most available GME witnesses are tailored towards some specific states, for instance, the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states [40], W-states [41], graph states [42, 43], and so on. Despite few general methods for the construction of GME witness have been proposed [44, 45, 46, 47], their performance is very limited, especially as the size of system grows. One major drawback is the limited scope of noise resistance. For example, the fidelity-based method [44] is a canonical witness construction and widely used nowadays. Its noise tolerance decreases dramatically as the system size increases. In realistic NISQ systems, however, the noise always inevitably grows with the system size. In fact, it has been shown that the fidelity witnesses fail to detect a large amount of mixed entangled states [48]. To find more robust GME witnesses, numerical methods have been introduced [45],which, however, suffer from expensive computational costs as the system size grows. Hence, although it is known that for any entangled state there exists some EW to detect it [27], how to construct a desirable EW to recognize a GME state is still a formidable challenge.\nIn this work, we propose a generic framework to design robust GME witnesses by analytical and systematic construction. We start by introducing an exquisite method for GME witness with a novel lifting from any set of bipartite EWs. This establishes the link between the standard tools developed in the bipartite case and the GME witness construction. We then provide a well-designed class of optimal bipartite EWs that allows the design of robust GME witnesses for arbitrary pure GME states with our method. The performance of this framework on many typical classes of GME states is further evaluated in terms of white noise tolerance. It can be shown that the framework outperforms the most widely used fidelity-based method with certainty, and outperforms much better than the best known EWs in many cases. Finally, benefiting from the high robustness of the resulting witnesses, we also demonstrate further applications of the framework, such as to provide a tighter lower bounds on the genuine multipartite entanglement measures and detecting unfaithful GME states [48]."

A pure state is called biseparable if it can be written as a tensor product of two state vectors, i.e., |\u03c8A\u3009 \u2297 |\u03c8A\u0304\u3009. Then a mixed state is called biseparable if it can be decomposed into a mixture of pure biseparable states, formally,\n\u03c1bs = \u2211 A|A\u0304,i pA|A\u0304,i|\u03c8 i A\u3009\u3008\u03c8iA| \u2297 |\u03c8iA\u0304\u3009\u3008\u03c8 i A\u0304 |, (1)\nwhere the summation can be performed over different bipartitions A|A\u0304 of the whole system. A state that is not biseparable is referred to as genuine multipartite entangled. To detect the GME states, the most widely used method is to find an observable WGME that is nonnegative for all separable states and has negative expectation value on at least one GME state. Then for some multipartite quantum state \u03c1, the fact Tr(WGME\u03c1) < 0 will reveal the existence of genuine multipartite entanglement, and the WGME is called a GME witness. Moreover, given two EWs W1 and W2, if there exists \u03bb > 0 such that W1 \u2212 \u03bbW2 is positive semidefinite, i.e., W1 \u03bbW2, one says that W2 is finer than W1 [29]. The finer witness operator W2 detects more entangled states than W1. An EW is optimal if no finer EW exists."

            "text": "Due to its non-negativity over all biseparable states, a GME witness WGME also serves as bipartite EW with respect to each possible bipartition of the whole system. In other words, there exists a complete set of bipartite EWs {WA|A\u0304} satisfying WGME WA|A\u0304 for each bipartition A|A\u0304. This fact, from the opposite point of view, indicates that the GME witness WGME is designed based on the set {WA|A\u0304} according to the constraint WGME WA|A\u0304. This naturally provides a general framework for constructing GME witnesses from a complete set of bipartite EWs. Remarkably, the set {WA|A\u0304} itself cannot be directly used to detect GME states, as there exist biseparable states that are entangled with respect to every possible bipartition [23]. While there are two crucial issues with such a framework. The first one is how to find the operator satisfying WGME WA|A\u0304, and the second one is to decide which set of bipartite EWs should be used. Optimal solutions to these two problems is hard in general, and there have been only a few previous related studies on these issues. In Ref. [46], an alternative solution was proposed to establish a connection between positive maps and multipartite EWs, where EWs detecting multipartite bound entangled state have been obtained. While in the following, we present a novel alternatively solution which is capable of constructing robust GME witnesses."

            "text": "Any mixed GME state contains at least one pure GME state as a component, while the remaining components can be treated as noises. In order to detect mixed GME states with linear EW, it is natural to employ a witness operator for the pure GME component that is sufficiently robust to noise from the other components. In fact, the set of all optimal GME witnesses for all pure GME states will be sufficient to detect all GME states. However, finding all optimal GME witnesses is naturally a formidable task. Therefore, to advance\na solution to this problem, we propose an operational framework to construct a class of robust GME witnesses for all pure GME states.\nTo address the problem of lifting any given set of bipartite EWs to multipartite, one can accomplish it in two steps: (1) For the first step, each bipartite EW WA|A\u0304 is decomposed into some projectors. Note that the entanglement witness is designed for some pure entangled state |\u03c8\u3009. Hence we extract a term \u2212|\u03c8\u3009\u3008\u03c8| before the decomposition. That is, the bipartite EWs are rewritten as WA|A\u0304 = OA|A\u0304 \u2212 |\u03c8\u3009\u3008\u03c8|, and a spectral decomposition of OA|A\u0304 = WA|A\u0304 + |\u03c8\u3009\u3008\u03c8| is performed\nOA|A\u0304 = \u2211\n|~vi,A|A\u0304\u3009\u2208SA|A\u0304\nci,A|A\u0304|~vi,A|A\u0304\u3009\u3008~vi,A|A\u0304|, (2)\nwith SA|A\u0304 being the set of eigenvectors and ci,A|A\u0304 being the corresponding eigenvalues. All these eigenvectors are collected into a set S = \u222aA|A\u0304SA|A\u0304. (2). For the second step, the obtained set S is divided into m subsets {Sk}mk=1, such that the vectors from different subsets are orthogonal with each other. Denote I\u0303k as the identity operator on the subspace Vk spanned by the state vectors from subset Sk, and ck = max|~vi,A|A\u0304\u3009\u2208Skci,A|A\u0304 as the maximal coefficient attached to the state vectors in Sk. With the above preparation and notation, we proceed to the following Theorem:\nTheorem 1. Given any pure GME state |\u03c8\u3009 and a set of bipartite EWs {WA|A\u0304} detecting |\u03c8\u3009 for all possible A|A\u0304, the following operator W\u0302\nW\u0302 = m\u2211 k=1 ckI\u0303k \u2212 |\u03c8\u3009\u3008\u03c8|, (3)\nis nonnegative over all biseparable states, where the ck and I\u0303k have been defined above.\nProof. To prove the statement, it suffices to observe\nW\u0302\u2212WA|A\u0304 = m\u2211 k=1 ckI\u0303k \u2212 OA|A\u0304\n= m\u2211 k=1 ckI\u0303k \u2212 \u2211 |vi,A|A\u0304\u3009\u2208Sk\u2229SA|A\u0304 ci,A|A\u0304|~vi,A|A\u0304\u3009\u3008~vi,A|A\u0304|  \u2265\nm\u2211 k=1 ck I\u0303k \u2212 \u2211 |vi,A|A\u0304\u3009\u2208Sk\u2229SA|A\u0304 |~vi,A|A\u0304\u3009\u3008~vi,A|A\u0304|  \u22650,\n(4)\nwhere the inequalities can be derived directly from the definitions of ck and I\u0303k.\nThe above construction can be interpreted geometrically. That is, noise from different subspaces has different degrees of influence on the entanglement properties of the target state. The influence is characterized by the coefficients ck, and a small ck indicates that noise from this subspace hardly affects the entanglement property of target state. Therefore, Theorem 1 can be seen as robust GME witness construction with the help of some prior knowledge of the target state, which comes from the set of bipartite EWs {WA|A\u0304}.\nRemarkably, Theorem 1 itself cannot be used as an operational framework for GME witness construction, since the resulting operators can be positive semidefinite and fail\nto detect any GME state. In fact, one can hardly expect a nontrivial result when the set of bipartite EWs WA|A\u0304 are chosen randomly. Fortunately, standard tools exist for constructing bipartite EWs based on positive maps. In the following, in order to obtain an operational and generic framework for GME witness construction, we provide a promising choice on the set of bipartite EWs, which are designed for the target states based on partial transposition.\nUnder any given bipartition A|A\u0304, the target state |\u03c8\u3009 can be written in a Schmidt decomposition form |\u03c8\u3009 = \u2211rA\u22121 i=0 \u221a \u03bbi, A|A\u0304|iAiA\u0304\u3009, with rA being the corresponding Schmidt rank. Note that here the local dimension of the Hilbert space need not be fixed. Then we introduce a class of bipartite EWs Wo,A|A\u0304 in order to use them in the construction of GME witness.\nWo,A|A\u0304 = rA\u22121\u2211 i,j=0 \u221a \u03bbi, A|A\u0304\u03bbj, A|A\u0304|iAjA\u0304\u3009\u3008iAjA\u0304| \u2212 |\u03c8\u3009\u3008\u03c8|. (5)\nThe choice of Wo,A|A\u0304 is mainly based on two considerations. Firstly, Wo,A|A\u0304 + |\u03c8\u3009\u3008\u03c8| naturally takes the decomposition form in the Eq. (2). Secondly, the above Wo,A|A\u0304 are a class of optimal bipartite EWs. For a detailed illustration and discussion on the Wo,A|A\u0304, please refer to Appendix. A.\nThese bipartite EWs, together with Theorem 1, promise a generic framework to construct GME witnesses with certainty. The explicit procedure is as follows:\n(1). Firstly, find the set S. For each bipartitionM |M\u0304 , calculate the Schmidt decomposition of |\u03c8\u3009 with respect to M |M\u0304 ,\n|\u03c8\u3009 = rM|M\u0304\u22121\u2211 i=0 \u03bbi,M |M\u0304 |\u03d5i,M \u3009|\u03d5i,M\u0304 \u3009, (6)\nwith rM |M\u0304 being the Schmidt rank under this bipartition. A total of r 2 M |M\u0304 vectors will be added to the set S, and each of them has a corresponding coefficient. This is denoted by\n{( \u221a \u03bbi,M |M\u0304\u03bbj,M |M\u0304 , |\u03d5i,M \u3009|\u03d5j,M\u0304 \u3009)} rM|M\u0304\u22121 i,j=0 . (7)\nAfter traversing all possible bipartitions, one will end up with a set of vectors S as well as their corresponding coefficients, that is, {(ck, |\u03c8k\u3009)} |S| k=1.\n(2). Secondly, find the finest division of S such that vectors from different subsets are orthogonal with each other. This can be achieved with the following steps:\n(i) Put the first element |\u03c81\u3009 of S into an empty subset S1. (ii) For every other vector in S\u2212S1, if it is not orthogonal with all vectors in the set\nS1, it is added into S1. Repeat this step until no new vector can be added to S1. (iii) For the rest vectors in S\u2212 S1, repeat the above two steps to obtain S\u2212 S1 \u2212 S2, S\u2212 S1 \u2212 S2 \u2212 S3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , until one has classified all the elements of S. (iv) One obtain a division S = \u2211m k=1 Sk.\n(3). Thirdly, calculate the subspace spanned by the vectors in subset Sk. By performing Schmidt orthogonalization of the vectors in Sk, one can derive the subspace spanned by these vectors and obtain the identity operator I\u0303k on this subspace.\n(4). Finally, for each subset Sk, find the maximal coefficients ck attached to the vectors in it, and construct a GME witness using Theorem 1.\nThere are two remarks to note about this method. Firstly, the resulting witness from the above procedure is always finer than the commonly used GME fidelity witness WF = \u03bbI\u2212|\u03c8\u3009\u3008\u03c8| for |\u03c8\u3009, with \u03bb = maxA|A\u0304 \u03bb0,A|A\u0304 (Here it is assumed that the Schmidt coefficients \u03bbi,A|A\u0304 are in decreasing order). To illustrate this, note that if the bipartite EWs are chosen as the bipartite fidelity witness WF,A|A\u0304 = \u03bb0,A|A\u0304I \u2212 |\u03c8\u3009\u3008\u03c8|, by applying Theorem 1, the obtained operator is nothing but the WF . Whereas by checking WF,A|A\u0304 \u2212Wo,A|A\u0304 0, it is straightforward to verify that the above Wo,A|A\u0304 is finer than the bipartite fidelity witness WF,A|A\u0304. Therefore, when Theorem 1 is applied to the set of Wo,A|A\u0304, the resulting GME witness strictly outperforms the corresponding fidelity witness WF . Secondly, one starts from a complete set of bipartite EWs in the above construction, leading to EWs that detect genuine multipartite entanglement. While if one starts from a smaller set of bipartite EWs, the method allows also for flexible applications in verifying other kinds of multipartite entanglement, e.g., characterizing the entanglement depth."

Meanwhile, the white noise tolerance pCln exhibits a similar asymptotic behavior as in the first example, that is, tending to 1 for large n. We remark that while the resulting EWs are quite robust, they are not optimal. In fact, the optimality of the bipartite EWs employed in the construction is not sufficient to guarantee the optimality of the resulting GME witness. For some explicit target states, one may either analytically or numerically optimize the result. While a systematic and operational improvement of this framework remains an open question. A brief discussion on this issue is provided at the end of Appendix. B.2."

The white noise tolerance of W|\u03c6s\u3009 is pW|\u03c6s\u3009 = (1\u2212 \u2211d\u22121 i=0 \u03bb 2 i )/(1\u2212\ni=0 \u03bb\n2\ni + 2\nn\u22121\u22121\ndn ((\n\u2211d\u22121\ni=0\n\u221a\n\u03bbi)2 \u2212 1))). The pW|\u03c6s\u3009 tends to 1 for large n when d > 2.\nAs a comparison, the best-known GME witness for this kind of states comes from the\nfidelity-based method, with W|\u03c8s\u3009F = \u03bb0I \u2212 |\u03c6s\u3009\u3008\u03c6s|. The white noise tolerance of W |\u03c8s\u3009 F is (1 \u2212 \u03bb0)/(1 \u2212 1/dn), which tends to 1 \u2212 \u03bb0 \u2264 1 \u2212 1/d with an increasing system size. For the special case of n-qudit GHZ states |GHZdn\u3009, the performance of our construction and the fidelity-based method is compared in Fig. 2, where a significant improvement is demonstrated. Note that for n-qubit GHZ states |GHZn\u3009, the fidelity witness is already optimal, and hence we start from the local dimension d = 3 in Fig. 2."

B.4, a further discussion of the entanglement detection for multi-qubit singlet states is proposed based on our framework.\nConsequently, we have provided a generic framework for detecting arbitrary target GME state in a noisy systems by constructing robust GME witnesses. Firstly, by benchmarking its performance on some well-studied states, it is observed that this framework results in robust GME witnesses that perform comparable to the current best witnesses for these states. For other less investigated states, the most widely used method to construct EW for them is the fidelity-based method. As shown in these examples, our framework can provide a significant improvement compared with the fidelity-based method. This also leads to the conjecture that a large amount of pure GME states become fairly robust to noise as the system size increases. Secondly, the advantage of our framework against the fidelity-based method comes with no experimental overheads. This benefits from the fact that the \u2211 k ckI\u0303k term in this construction is usually diagonal in some well-defined basis, such as the graph state basis and the computational basis. Finally, it should be stressed that Theorem 1 can be applied not only to the class of bipartite EWs shown in Eq. (5), but also to other classes of bipartite EWs. This potentially results in some different GME witnesses. Further example is provided in Appendix. A.3."

            "text": "The unfaithful entangled states are a large class of states that cannot be recognized with any fidelity witness and have been attracted both theoretical and experimental interests [53, 54, 55, 56]. Therefore, given that we have already gained access to construct finer\nGME witnesses than the fidelity-based method, it is natural to investigate their ability on the detection of unfaithful GME states.\nIn general, deciding whether an entangled state is unfaithful is a nontrivial task, since one has to prove that the state is not detected by all fidelity witnesses, rather than a certain one. In bipartite case, a necessary and sufficient criterion for a state \u03c1AB to be unfaithful has been proposed [53], while for multipartite case, it remains an open question on characterization of unfaithfulness. To avoid this difficulty and verify an EW indeed detects unfaithfulness, we limit our attention to a special class of states \u03c1(p) = pI/dn + (1\u2212p)\u03c10. that there is an upper bound on the white noise tolerance of any fidelity witness for arbitrary state. Denote WF = \u03b1I \u2212 \u03c1\u2032 as an arbitrary fidelity witness, then one can derive its white noise tolerance pF for arbitrary \u03c1(p) by solving Tr(WF\u03c1(p)) = 0, which leads to\npF = max{ Tr(\u03c10\u03c1\u2032)\u2212 \u03b1\nTr(\u03c10\u03c1\u2032)\u2212 1/dn , 0}. (13)\nThen it is straightforward to see that pF \u2264 (1 \u2212 1/d)/(1 \u2212 1/dn), due to the fact that Tr(\u03c10\u03c1\u2032) \u2264 1 and \u03b1 \u2265 1/d. Hence it can be concluded that an EW can be employed to detect some unfaithful entangled states, as long as its white noise tolerance for some state is higher than (1 \u2212 1/d)/(1 \u2212 1/dn). This is precisely the case for many GME witnesses constructed with our framework. For example, in an n-qubit case, this upper bound is 1/(2(1 \u2212 1/2n)) and decreases to 1/2 as n grows. While our framework provides large amount of EWs with white noise tolerance converging to 1, allowing for the certification of unfaithfulness of many states in n-qubit case."

            "text": "Moreover, a witness operator is useful not only for entanglement certification, but also for entanglement quantification. To start with, we briefly review the method developed in Ref. [32] for optimally estimating some entanglement measure E given the expectation value of some witness operator W. The task can be described as finding the lower bound\n(w) = inf \u03c1 {E(\u03c1)|Tr(\u03c1W) = w}, (14)\nwhere the infimum is taken over all states compatible with the data w = Tr(\u03c1W). Note that (w) is a convex function, and thus there exist bounds of the type\n(w) \u2265 r \u00b7 w \u2212 c, (15)\nfor an arbitrary r. By inserting w = Tr(\u03c1W) and E(\u03c1) \u2265 (w), it is observed that\nc \u2265 r \u00b7 Tr(\u03c1W)\u2212 E(\u03c1), (16)\nshould be satisfied for any \u03c1. Hence given a \"slope\" r, the optimal constant c is\nc = E\u0302(r \u00b7W) := sup \u03c1 {r \u00b7 Tr(\u03c1W)\u2212 E(\u03c1)}. (17)\nFinally, an optimal lower bound is obtained after optimizing r:\n(w) = sup r {r \u00b7 w \u2212 E\u0302(r \u00b7W)}. (18)\nIt should be remarked that we limit our discussions into the nontrivial case where a negative expectation w of a witness operator is observed in the following. In this case, the optimal \"slope\" r should always be negative.\nNow, suppose that the W2 is a finer EW than the W1, satisfying W2 W1. It is straightforward to see that\nE\u0302(r \u00b7W1) \u2265 E\u0302(r \u00b7W2). (19)\nTherefore, when these two operators W1 and W2 have the same expectation value w0,\n2(w0) = sup r {r \u00b7 w0 \u2212 E\u0302(r \u00b7W2)}\n\u2265 sup r {r \u00b7 w0 \u2212 E\u0302(r \u00b7W1)} = 1(w0).\n(20)\nFor the same target state \u03c1, the expectations w1 and w2 of these two witness operators always satisfy w1 \u2265 w2, which leads to 2(w2) \u2265 2(w1) \u2265 1(w1). That is, a finer EW provides a tighter lower bound on the entanglement measure for the same state. Hence, our framework enables a better estimation of the entanglement measures of genuine multipartite entanglement than the fidelity-based method.\nTo quantitatively investigate the improvement from these new GME witness, we discuss the estimation on the geometry measure of genuine multipartite entanglement for noisy n-partite d-dimensional GHZ states \u03c1n,d(p) = pI/dn + (1\u2212 p)|GHZdn\u3009\u3008GHZdn|, with |GHZdn\u3009 = \u2211d\u22121 i=0 |i\u3009\u2297n/ \u221a d. For arbitrary multipartite pure state |\u03c8\u3009, its geometric measurement of GME is defined by EG(|\u03c8\u3009) = 1\u2212max|\u03c6bs\u3009 |\u3008\u03c6bs|\u03c8\u3009| 2, with |\u03c6bs\u3009 being arbitrary pure biseparable state. The geometric measure of GME is extended to mixed states by the convex roof construction\nEG(\u03c1) = inf pi,|\u03c8i\u3009 \u2211 i piEG(|\u03c8i\u3009), (21)\nwhere the minimization runs over all possible decompositions \u03c1 = \u2211 i pi|\u03c8i\u3009\u3008\u03c8i|.\nBased on the result in Ref. [57], one can derive a lower bound n,df (p) for EG(\u03c1n,d(p))\nEG(\u03c1n,d(p)) \u2265 n,df (p) := 1\u2212 \u03b3(S), (22)\nwhere \u03b3(S) = [ \u221a S+ \u221a (d\u2212 1)(d\u2212 S)]2/d with S = max{1, d(1\u2212p)+p/dn\u22121}. This is just the lower bound related to the fidelity witness WF = I/d\u2212 |GHZdn\u3009\u3008GHZdn|. Whereas it has been proved in the previous section that finer EW is accessible with our method, that is,\nWo,|GHZdn\u3009 = d\u22121\u2211 i,j=0, i<j n\u22121\u2211 r=1 \u2211 m 1 d \u03c0m(|i\u3009\u2297r|j\u3009\u2297n\u2212r)\u03c0m(\u3008i\u2297r|\u3008j|\u2297n\u2212r)\n+ d\u22121\u2211 i=0 1 d |i\u3009\u3008i|\u2297n \u2212 |GHZdn\u3009\u3008GHZdn|.\n(23)\nWith the expectation value wn,d(p) = Tr(\u03c1n,d(p)Wo,|GHZdn\u3009) from this finer EW, a lower bound n,do (p) can be derived by employing the technique developed in Ref. [32]:\nEG(\u03c1n,d(p)) \u2265 n,do (p) := sup r\n{ r \u00b7 wn,d(p)\u2212 E\u0302G(rWo,|GHZdn\u3009) } , (24)\nwith r being a real number, and\nE\u0302G(rWo,|GHZdn\u3009) = sup|\u03c8\u3009 sup |\u03c6bs\u3009\n{ \u3008\u03c8|(rWo,|GHZdn\u3009 + |\u03c6bs\u3009\u3008\u03c6bs|)|\u03c8\u3009 \u2212 1 } , (25)\nwhere the maximization runs over all pure state |\u03c8\u3009 and biseparable state |\u03c6bs\u3009. Furthermore, in this special case, it can be verified that one has to choose |\u03c6bs\u3009 as a state having the largest overlap with |GHZdn\u3009, which results in\nE\u0302G(rWo,|GHZdn\u3009) = 1\u2212 r 2 + 1 2\n\u221a (1\u2212 r)2 + 4rd\u2212 1\nd + r d \u2212 1. (26)\nBy inserting this equation into Eq. (24), the lower bound n,do (p) can be solved directly.\nIn Fig. 3, we have shown the results for d = 3 and n = 3, 5, 7, 9 as examples, to illustrate the performance of our method with an increasing system size. As the number of subsystems grows, the critical value of p tends to 1, when the lower bound n,do (p) vanishes. Meanwhile, the n,do (p) is always larger than the n,d f (p) above, which vanishes at p = 1 \u2212 1/d for large n. That is, the new EWs Wo,|GHZdn\u3009 are able to provide a better estimation on the geometric measure of GME for \u03c1n,d(p). It remains open whether n,do (p) equals EG(\u03c1n,d(p)). However, it is still reasonable to expect that such new GME witnesses can provide faithful estimations on entanglement measures without the need for quantum tomography, as they are already robust enough."

In particular, this is achieved using a novel method to bring any complete set of bipartite EWs to a single GME witness. This method allows to make full use of some prior information about the target state to improve the noise resistance. In fact, the resulting GME witnesses turn out to be quite robust, whose white noise tolerance converge to 1 in many cases. As a consequence, this framework holds great practical potential in real-life situations, especially for detecting entanglement in noisy multipartite or high-dimensional systems. This will play a certain role in facilitating the solution of the very challenging problem of genuine multipartite entanglement detection.\nIn addition to genuine multipartite entanglement, we remark that our method is highly flexible and admits natural generalizations for detecting other types of entanglement. A relevant case is entanglement detection in quantum networks, which is currently under active investigations. In quantum networks, multipartite entanglement exhibits novel features due to the complex network topology [58, 59, 60], and better techniques are urgently needed for the characterization of genuine network multipartite entanglement. Finally, it will also be interesting to seek for further extension of the framework in high-order entanglement detection [10] as well as bound entanglement detection."

To prove that the W|\u03c6\u3009o is an EW, note that it is of the form Q\u0393 with Q being positive semidefinite (Q 0). Thus for all separable states Tr(\u03c1sepW|\u03c6\u3009o ) = Tr(\u03c1\u0393sepQ) \u2265 0. Meanwhile, Tr(W|\u03c6\u3009o |\u03c6\u3009\u3008\u03c6|) = \u2211 i \u03bb 2 i \u2212 1 = \u2212 \u2211 i 6=j \u03bbi\u03bbj < 0. Then W |\u03c6\u3009 o is an EW by definition. To show the optimality of W|\u03c6\u3009o , it is sufficient to prove that the set of pure separable states {|\u03c61\u3009\u2297|\u03c62\u3009} satisfying \u3008\u03c61|\u3008\u03c62|Wo|\u03c61\u3009|\u03c62\u3009 = 0 span the whole Hilbert spaceHd\u2297Hd [61]. For qubit case, one has W(2)o = \u221a \u03bb0\u03bb1(|01\u3009 \u2212 |10\u3009)(\u300801| \u2212 \u300810|)\u0393. It is easy to verify that the set of separable states {|00\u3009, (|0\u3009+ |1\u3009)(|0\u3009+ |1\u3009)/2, (|0\u3009+i|1\u3009)(|0\u3009\u2212i|1\u3009)/2, |11\u3009} satisfying Tr(\u03c1sepW(2)o ) = 0. This set of states span the whole Hilbert space H2 \u2297H2. In fact, it has been shown that any decomposable EW acting on H2 \u2297Hd is optimal iff it takes the form W = Q\u0393 for some Q 0 [62].\nSimilarly, in the qudit case (d > 2), there exist separable states {|ee\u3009, (|e\u3009+ |f\u3009)(|e\u3009+ |f\u3009)/2, (|e\u3009 + i|f\u3009)(|e\u3009 \u2212 i|f\u3009)/2, |ff\u3009} satisfying Tr(\u03c1sepW|\u03c6\u3009o ) = 0, for each pair 0 \u2264 e < f \u2264 d \u2212 1. These states span the same space with {|ee\u3009, |ef\u3009, |fe\u3009, |ff\u3009}. By iterating over all e < f , one ends up with a set of separable states spanning the whole space Hd \u2297Hd. Thus the EW W |\u03c6\u3009 o is optimal. This finishes the proof.\nA.2 Detection of bipartite unfaithful state\nRemarkably, for the |\u03c6\u3009, the most widely used fidelity witness reads W|\u03c6\u3009F = \u03bb0I\u2212|\u03c6\u3009\u3008\u03c6|. It is straightforward to observe that W|\u03c6\u3009F \u2212W |\u03c6\u3009 o 0, which means that the W|\u03c6\u3009o is finer than\nthe W|\u03c6\u3009F . This leads to a byproduct that the W |\u03c6\u3009 o can detect unfaithful states. Unfaithful states are entangled states which can not be detected by all fidelity witnesses [48], namely, an entangled state \u03c1 is unfaithful if and only if Tr(\u03c1W |\u03c8\u3009F ) \u2265 0 for all |\u03c8\u3009. Therefore, the relationship W|\u03c6\u3009F \u2212W |\u03c6\u3009 o 0 itself is not sufficient to demonstrate that the extra entangled states detected by W|\u03c6\u3009o is unfaithful. And a further clarification is required to justify the statement that W|\u03c6\u3009o detects unfaithful state.\nNow we would like to provide qualitative and quantitative characterization on the ability to detect unfaithfulness of the W|\u03c6\u3009o . Consider the class of states \u03c1|\u03c6\u3009(p) = pI/d2 + (1\u2212 p)|\u03c6\u3009\u3008\u03c6|. From the Observation 1 in Ref.

By solving Tr(\u03c1|\u03c6\u3009(p)Wm) = 0, we obtain that the white noise tolerance of Wm for |\u03c6\u3009 is\np |\u03c6\u3009 f =\n\u2211d\u22121 i,j=0 \u221a \u03bbi\u03bbj \u2212 1\u2211d\u22121\ni,j=0 \u221a \u03bbi\u03bbj \u2212 1d . (29)\nThat is, \u03c1|\u03c6\u3009(p) is faithful when p < p |\u03c6\u3009 f . Similarly, one can obtain the white noise tolerance of W|\u03c6\u3009o for |\u03c6\u3009, which is\np|\u03c6\u3009o = 1\u2212\n\u2211d\u22121 i=0 \u03bb 2 i\n1\u2212 \u2211d\u22121 i=0 \u03bb 2 i + 1d2 ( \u2211d\u22121 i,j=0 \u221a \u03bbi\u03bbj \u2212 1) . (30)\nIt can be observed that\n1/p|\u03c6\u3009o \u2212 1 1/p|\u03c6\u3009f \u2212 1\n= ( \u2211d\u22121 i,j=0 \u221a \u03bbi\u03bbj \u2212 1)2\nd(d\u2212 1)(1\u2212 \u2211 i \u03bb 2 i )\n=1 + ( \u2211 i 6=j \u221a \u03bbi\u03bbj)2 \u2212 d(d\u2212 1)(1\u2212 \u2211 i \u03bb 2 i )\nd(d\u2212 1)(1\u2212 \u2211 i \u03bb 2 i )\n\u22641 + d(d\u2212 1)(\n\u2211 i 6=j \u03bbi\u03bbj)\u2212 d(d\u2212 1)(1\u2212 \u2211 i \u03bb 2 i )\nd(d\u2212 1)(1\u2212 \u2211 i \u03bb 2 i )\n=1 + d(d\u2212 1)(( \u2211d\u22121 i=0 \u03bbi)2 \u2212 1)\nd(d\u2212 1)(1\u2212 \u2211 i \u03bb 2 i )\n= 1.\n(31)\nIn other words, p|\u03c6\u3009f \u2264 p |\u03c6\u3009 o , where the inequality comes from the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality, and takes equality if d = 2 or \u03bbi = 1/d for all i. Therefore, the W|\u03c6\u3009o can always detect unfaithful state \u03c1|\u03c6\u3009(p) for p \u2208 [p |\u03c6\u3009 f , p |\u03c6\u3009 o ), unless |\u03c6\u3009 being a two-qubit state or maximally entangled. As a quantitative investigation, we numerically maximize the interval length ld of [p|\u03c6\u3009f , p |\u03c6\u3009 o ) over all |\u03c6\u3009 for different local dimension d. We name ld the maximal unfaithful length from the class of EWs W|\u03c6\u3009o , and the results are listed in Table. 1 for d = 3, 4, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 7.\nIt can be seen that ld grows significantly with an increasing dimension d, indicating that the W|\u03c6\u3009o can greatly outperform the fidelity witness. This is also in agreement with the statement that most states are unfaithful as claimed in Ref. [48].\nExcept for the ld, one may be also interested in the average performance of this new class of EWs on unfaithfulness detection. As a comparison, it is natural to consider two interval [p|\u03c6\u3009e , p|\u03c6\u3009f ) and [p |\u03c6\u3009 o , p |\u03c6\u3009 f ), where the p |\u03c6\u3009 e is the critical value such that \u03c1|\u03c6\u3009(p) becomes separable. The former interval contains all unfaithful \u03c1|\u03c6\u3009(p), while the latter contains the part that can be detected by the class of W|\u03c6\u3009o . Then one can use avg|\u03c6\u3009(p |\u03c6\u3009 o \u2212 p |\u03c6\u3009 f )/(p |\u03c6\u3009 e \u2212p|\u03c6\u3009f ) to evaluate the average performance of W |\u03c6\u3009 o for detecting unfaithfulness, as shown in Table. 2. It is observed that a large percentage of unfaithful states have been detected. This is also the premise that GME witnesses constructed from this class of bipartite EWs can detect multipartite unfaithful state.\nMoreover, the critical value p|\u03c6\u3009e is d 2\u221a\u03bb0\u03bb1\n1+d2 \u221a \u03bb0\u03bb1 according to the results in Ref. [63], assuming that the Schmidt coefficients \u03bbi are in decreasing order.\nA.3 Generalization of Lemma 1 Finally, we provide a generalization of Lemma 1. For the above entangled state|\u03c6\u3009, one can construct another positive operator\nQ\u0303 = d\u22121\u2211 i,j=0, i<j (\u03b1ij |ij\u3009 \u2212 \u03b2ij |ji\u3009)(\u03b1ij\u3008ij| \u2212 \u03b2ij\u3008ji|), (32)\ninstead of Q, where \u03b1ij\u03b2ij = \u221a \u03bbi\u03bbj and the \u03b1ij , \u03b2ij are all positive. The operator W\u0303o = Q\u0303\u0393 is also optimal EW and applicable in our framework for GME witness construction. Here, the proof of the optimality of W\u0303o is similar to the case in Lemma 1. It is sufficient to verify that the set of state {|ee\u3009, |ff\u3009, ( \u221a \u03b2ef |e\u3009+ \u221a \u03b1ef |f\u3009)\u2297 ( \u221a \u03b1ef |e\u3009+ \u221a \u03b2ef |f\u3009), ( \u221a \u03b2ef |e\u3009+ i \u221a \u03b1ef |f\u3009)\u2297 ( \u221a \u03b1ef |e\u3009 \u2212 i \u221a \u03b2ef |f\u3009)}d\u22121e,f=0 have zero expectation value when measured with W\u0303o, and span the whole d2-dimensional Hilbert space."

            "text": "In this section, we will show explicitly how this construction can be applied to some commonly used multipartite entangled states, and make further discussions on the results.\nB.1 W -state The W -state is an important class of multiqubit entangled states. A class of EWs for W -state which can outperform significantly than the fidelity witness has been proposed in Ref. [49]. In Ref. [49], the authors construct an operator at first, and then prove that this operator is decomposable bipartite EW with respect to all possible bipartitions. While our construction is in the opposite direction. We construct a complete set of bipartite EWs for W -state, and lift them to a GME witness. Although different method has been used, our construction recovers the result in Ref. [49].\nWe start with the simplest 3-qubit case, where the target state is\n|W3\u3009 = 1\u221a 3 (|001\u3009+ |010\u3009+ |100\u3009). (33)\nFor the bipartition 1|23, the EW constructed from Lemma 1 is of the form\nW |W3\u3009 1|23 =\n\u221a 2\n3 (|000\u3009\u3008000|+ |1\u03c8 +\u3009\u30081\u03c8+|)\n+ 23 |0\u03c8 +\u3009\u30080\u03c8+|+ 13 |100\u3009\u3008100| \u2212 |W3\u3009\u3008W3|,\n(34)\nwith |\u03c8+\u3009 = (|01 + 10\u3009)/ \u221a\n2. And for the other two bipartitions, the W2|13 and W3|12 can be obtained after permutation of qubits. Then for |W3\u3009, the set S reads\nS = {|000\u3009\u3008000|, |001\u3009\u3008001|, |010\u3009\u3008010|, |100\u3009\u3008100|, |0\u03c8+\u3009\u30080\u03c8+|, |02\u03c8+13\u3009\u300802\u03c8 + 13|, |\u03c8\n+0\u3009\u3008\u03c8+0|, |1\u03c8+\u3009\u30081\u03c8+|, |12\u03c8+13\u3009\u300812\u03c8 + 13|, |\u03c8 +1\u3009\u3008\u03c8+1|}. (35)\nThese states in S can be grouped into 3 subsets according to the procedure in the main text:\nS1 = {|000\u3009\u3008000|}, S2 = {|001\u3009\u3008001|, |010\u3009\u3008010|, |100\u3009\u3008100|,\n|0\u03c8+\u3009\u30080\u03c8+|, |02\u03c8+13\u3009\u300802\u03c8 + 13|, |\u03c8 +0\u3009\u3008\u03c8+0|} S3 = {|1\u03c8+\u3009\u30081\u03c8+|, |12\u03c8+13\u3009\u300812\u03c8 + 13|, |\u03c8 +1\u3009\u3008\u03c8+1|},\n(36)\nand the corresponding \u03b1k by Theorem 1 is\n\u03b11 = \u221a 2/3, \u03b12 = 2/3, \u03b13 = \u221a 2/3 (37)\nrespectively. This result in a GME witness\nW|W3\u3009 = \u221a 2 3 (|000\u3009\u3008000|+ |101\u3009\u3008101|+ |011\u3009\u3008011|+ |110\u3009\u3008110|)\n+ 23(|001\u3009\u3008001|+ |010\u3009\u3008010|+ |100\u3009\u3008100|)\u2212 |W3\u3009\u3008W3|. (38)\nMoreover, by employing the generalization of Lemma 1 in Eq. (32), one obtains\nW\u20321|23 = [ (a|0\u3009|00\u3009 \u2212 b|1\u3009|\u03c8+\u3009)(a\u30080|\u300800| \u2212 b\u30081|\u3008\u03c8+|) ]\u03931 , (39)\nwhere a, b are positive numbers and satisfy ab = \u221a\n2/3. The other two bipartite EWs are obtained immediately after rearrangement of the qubits. For this set of bipartite EWs, the EW W|W3\u3009 can be generalized into\nW\u2032|W3\u3009 =a 2|000\u3009\u3008000|+ b2(|101\u3009\u3008101|+ |011\u3009\u3008011|+ |110\u3009\u3008110|)\n+ 23(|001\u3009\u3008001|+ |010\u3009\u3008010|+ |100\u3009\u3008100|)\u2212 |W3\u3009\u3008W3|. (40)\nIn n-qubit cases, if a subsystem A contains m qubits, the corresponding bipartite EW from the Lemma 1 is of the form (1 \u2264 m \u2264 n\u2212 1)\nWm|n\u2212m =\n\u221a m(n\u2212m)\nn2 |\u03c8\u3009m|n\u2212m\u3008\u03c8|\u0393A , (41)\nwhere |\u03c8\u3009m|n\u2212m = |0\u3009\u2297mA|0\u3009\u2297n\u2212mA\u0304 \u2212 |Wm\u3009A|Wn\u2212m\u3009A\u0304. Then the set S for |Wn\u3009 can still be grouped into 3 subsets:\n{|0\u2297n\u3009}, {|\u03c0m(0\u2297n\u221211)\u3009}, {|\u03c0\u2032m(0\u2297n\u221221\u22972)\u3009}, (42)\nwith the corresponding coefficients \u03b1k being\n\u03b11 = max m\n\u221a m(n\u2212m) n2 = \u221a bn/2c(n\u2212 bn/2c) n ,\n\u03b12 = max m n\u2212m n = n\u2212 1 n ,\n\u03b13 = max m\n\u221a m(n\u2212m) n2 = \u221a bn/2c(n\u2212 bn/2c) n .\n(43)\nTherefore we arrive at the following W|Wn\u3009,\nW|Wn\u3009 = n\u2212 1 n\nP1 + \u221a bn/2c(n\u2212 bn/2c)\nn (|0\u3009\u30080|\u2297n + P2)\u2212 |Wn\u3009\u3008Wn|, (44)\nwith Pi = \u2211 m \u03c0m(|0\u3009\u2297n\u2212i|1\u3009\u2297i)\u03c0m(\u30080|\u2297n\u2212i\u30081|\u2297i), where the summation m is over all possible permutation of |0\u3009\u2297n\u2212i|1\u3009\u2297i. The EW W|Wn\u3009 can also be generalized in a similar manner with the W|W3\u3009, so as to recover the results of Ref. [49]. Although ending up with the same witness operator, our construction provides a different insight on why the W|Wn\u3009 takes such a form.\nB.2 Graph states Before discussing the construction of GME witnesses for the graph states, we first give a brief introduction to the graph states. A graph is a pair G = (V,E) of sets, where the elements of V are called vertices, and the elements of E are edges connecting the vertices. For example, (1, 2) represents the edge connecting vertex 1 and 2. Two vertices are called neighboring if they are connected by an edge. A graph can also be represented by the adjacency matrix \u0393 with\n\u0393ij = {\n1, if (vi, vj) \u2208 E, 0, otherwise.\n(45)\nThen, an n-qubit graph state |G\u3009 is defined with an n-vertex graph G whose vertices correspond to qubits and edges correspond to control-Z (C-Z) gate between two qubits. Graph state can be expressed with a set of stabilizers\ngi = Xi \u220f\nj\u2208N(i) Zj , i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n, (46)\nwhere Xi and Zi are Pauli operators on qubit (vertex) i, and N(i) is the neighborhood of i (i.e. the set of vertices directly connected to i by edges). These operators gi commute with each other and |G\u3009 is the common eigenstate of them such that\n\u2200i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n, gi|G\u3009 = |G\u3009, (47)\nMoreover, all the 2n common eigenstates of these gi form a basis named graph state basis. Each term in this basis is uniquely decided by the eigenvalues of gi. As the eigenvalues of gi are either 1 or \u22121, the graph state basis can be denoted by a vector ~a \u2208 {0, 1}n such that \u2200i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n, gi|a1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 an\u3009G = (\u22121)ai |a1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 an\u3009G. (48) And the density matrix of |~a\u3009G is\n|a1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 an\u3009G\u3008a1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 an| = n\u220f i=1 (\u22121)aigi + I 2 . (49)\nSpecially, the graph state |G\u3009 is denoted as |0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0\u3009G. Remarkably, by choosing the graph state basis instead of the computational basis, the calculation of GME witness construction can be greatly simplified, without needing to perform the Schmidt decomposition. Firstly, the partial transposition of a graph state is diagonal under the graph state basis, namely, |~a0\u3009G\u3008~a0|TA is of the form \u2211 ~a c~a|~a\u3009G\u3008~a|. Meanwhile, the operator Q in Eq. (27) can be seen as a linear combination of all the eigenstates with negative eigenvalue of |G\u3009\u3008G|TA . Therefore, when Lemma 1 is applied to the graph state |G\u3009, the resulting bipartite EW W|G\u3009\no,A|A\u0304 is diagonal in the graph state basis. In this case, the vectors in the set S can be taken as the base vectors |~a\u3009G, such that the construction in Theorem 1 is easy to achieve. In the following, we propose an explicit procedure for finding the decomposition of W|G\u3009\no,A|A\u0304 in the graph state basis.\nFirstly, for the given bipartition A|A\u0304, the adjacency matrix \u0393 can be decomposed into following blocks GA \u0393A|A\u0304\n\u0393A|A\u0304 GA\u0304  . (50) We denote k = rank(\u0393A|A\u0304) as the rank of the submatrix \u0393A|A\u0304. It is known that a graph state can be transformed into tensor product of k Bell states across the partitions A and A\u0304, using C-Z gates within each partition and local complementation operations [42]. Here the local complementation \u03c4a on a vertex a is defined as follows: \u03c4a : G\u2192 \u03c4a(G), such that the edge set E\u2032 of the new graph \u03c4a(G) is E\u2032 = E \u222a E (N (a) , N (a)) \u2212 E \u2229 E (N (a) , N (a)). The local complementation \u03c4a(G) can be implemented with the following local unitary operation [42]:\nUa(G) = (\u2212iXa)1/2 \u220f\nb\u2208N(a) (iZb)1/2. (51)\nAfter this operation, |G\u3009 is turned into |\u03c4a(G)\u3009 and the stabilizers of |G\u3009 transform according to the following equations:\nUa(G)gGb Ua(G) = g\u03c4a(G)a g \u03c4a(G) b , if b \u2208 N(a); Ua(G)gGb Ua(G) = g \u03c4a(G) b , if b /\u2208 N(a).\n(52)\nMeanwhile, we remark that a bipartite EWWA|A\u0304 for |G\u3009 has been transformed into another bipartite EW W\u2032\nA|A\u0304 for |G \u2032\u3009 after some local unitary operation with respect to A|A\u0304. Hence\nour task for constructing bipartite EW of the initial graph state |G\u3009 has been turned into finding a bipartite EW for |Bell\u3009\u2297k by employing Lemma 1, a much easier task compared with the initial one.\nSecondly, after reversing the above transformation process from |G\u3009 to |Bell\u3009\u2297k, the EW for |Bell\u3009\u2297k which is diagonal in Bell state basis will be turned back into a bipartite EW for |G\u3009 which is diagonal in graph state basis.\nWith the above foundation, we move on to a explicit discussion on a typical class of graph states: linear cluster state |Cln\u3009. Linear cluster state is represented with the graph in Fig. 4.\nWe call the bipartition A|A\u0304 a rank-k bipartition if rank(\u0393A|A\u0304) = k, with the \u0393A|A\u0304 defined in Eq. (50). All rank-1 bipartitions of linear cluster state have only two possible types of the subgraph on the boundary \u0393A|A\u0304 (Fig. 5). Any other edge is deleted by C-Z\ngates within each partition. For the type-1 subgraph Gi,i+1, the bipartite EW reads\nWGi,i+1 = 1 2 ( |0i0i+1\u3009Gi,i+1\u30080i0i+1|+ |0i1i+1\u3009Gi,i+1\u30080i1i+1|+ |1i0i+1\u3009Gi,i+1\u30081i0i+1|\n+|1i1i+1\u3009Gi,i+1\u30081i1i+1| ) \u2212 |Gi,i+1\u3009\u3008Gi,i+1|.\n(53)\nby employing Lemma 1, where the state vectors like |0i1i+1\u3009Gi,i+1 are graph state basis defined in the Eq. (48), and the \u20180\u2019s on other vertices are omitted for simplicity here and after. Note that the gGi,i+1j can be transformed back to the g Cln j by employing C-Z gates without disturbing the eigenvalue of the state vector. Therefore the bipartite EW for the original state |Cln\u3009 is\nWA|A\u0304 = 1 2 (|Cln\u3009\u3008Cln|+ |0i1i+1\u3009Cln\u30080i1i+1|+ |1i0i+1\u3009Cln\u30081i0i+1|\n+|1i1i+1\u3009Cln\u30081i1i+1|)\u2212 |Cln\u3009\u3008Cln|, (54)\nwhen formulated in the graph state basis. After normalizing the WA|A\u0304 to meet the constraint Tr(WA|A\u0304|Cln\u3009\u3008Cln|) = \u22121, we obtain\nW\u2032 A|A\u0304 = |0i1i+1\u3009Cln\u30080i1i+1|+ |1i0i+1\u3009Cln\u30081i0i+1|+ |1i1i+1\u3009Cln\u30081i1i+1| \u2212 |Cln\u3009\u3008Cln|, (55)\nas the bipartite EW used in our construction. This bipartite EW contributes the following terms to the set S:\n{|0i1i+1\u3009Cln , |1i0i+1\u3009Cln , |1i1i+1\u3009Cln}. (56)\nThis set is denoted as Si,type\u22121 = {01, 10, 11}i,i+1 for short. Meanwhile, the type-2 subgraph Gi,i+1,i+2 in Fig. 5 can be transformed into the type-1 subgraph after applying CZ,(i,i+2), Ui(Gi,i+1,i+2) and CZ,(i,i+2) sequentially. We remark that the local complementation operation Ui(Gi,i+1,i+2) may change the corresponding eigenvalue when gGi,i+1,i+2j turns into g Gi,i+1 j , which is decided by the Eq. (52). Therefore, this kind of bipartitions contribute the following set of states to the set S:\nSi,type\u22122 = {010, 101, 111}i,i+1,i+2. (57)\nIn summary, all the rank-1 bipartitions contribute an operator R1 by our construction. If one denotes the V1 as the set of vectors from {0, 1}n such that the maximal distance between the \u20181\u2019s appearing in each vector is smaller than 3, the R1 can be formulated as\nR1 = \u2211 ~a\u2208V1 |~a\u3009Cln\u3008~a|. (58)\nFor rank-2 bipartitions, their boundaries are composed of two rank-1 boundaries. For example, if there are two type-1 parts, the bipartite EW takes the form\nWA|A\u0304 = 1 4 \u2211 ~a\u2208{0,1}4 |~ai,i+1,j,j+1\u3009Cln\u3008~ai,i+1,j,j+1| \u2212 |Cln\u3009\u3008Cln|. (59)\nAfter normalization, the bipartite EW reads\nWA|A\u0304 = 1 3 \u2211 ~a\u2208{0,1}4, ~a 6=~0 |~ai,i+1,j,j+1\u3009Cln\u3008~ai,i+1,j,j+1| \u2212 |Cln\u3009\u3008Cln|. (60)\nSuch bipartite EW contribute the following new terms to the set S:\nSi,type\u22121 \u2297 Sj,type\u22121 = {0101, 0110, 0111, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1101, 1110, 1111}i,i+1,j,j+1. (61) The contribution of other possibilities can be decided in a similar manner as above for the type-2 subgraph. All these rank-2 bipartitions contribute a set V2 to S. Here a vector from {0, 1}n belongs to V2 if there exist at most two \u20181\u2019s whose distance is larger than 2 at the same time in the vector. Finally, all the rank-2 bipartitions introduce an operator R2 to our construction, with\nR2 = \u2211 ~a\u2208V2 1 3 |~a\u3009Cln\u3008~a|. (62)\nFor a rank-k bipartition, the subgraph on the boundary is nothing but a combination of k rank-1 part. After repeating the above process, it is shown that all the rank-k bipartitions contribute the following operator Rk:\nRk = \u2211 ~a\u2208Vk 1 2k \u2212 1 |~a\u3009Cln\u3008~a|. (63)\nA vector ~a belongs to Vk if there exist at most k for the number of \u20181\u2019s in ~a, such that their distance with each other are larger than k at the same time. It can be observed immediately that k \u2264 dn/3e, indicating that the partition whose rank is higher than dn/3e gives no extra contribution.\nAfter considering all the bipartitions, we end up with the GME witnessWCln introduced in the main text, namely,\nWCln = dn/3e\u2211 k=1 Rk \u2212 |Cln\u3009\u3008Cln|. (64)\nAs an example, for 4-qubit cluster state,\nWCl4 = \u2211 ~a\u2208V1 |~a\u3009G\u3008~a|+ 1 3 \u2211 ~a\u2208V2 |~a\u3009G\u3008~a| \u2212 |G\u3009\u3008G|, (65)\nwhere V1 is the set {0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0101, 0110, 0111, 1000, 1010, 1100, 1110}, and V2 is the set {1001, 1011, 1101, 1111}.\nRemarkably, in 4-qubit case, the best known EW is [45]\nW opt Cl4 = \u2211 ~a\u2208V1 |~a\u3009G\u3008~a| \u2212 |G\u3009\u3008G|. (66)\nIt is finer than the WCl4 above. That is, while our approach is already quite powerful, there is still room for improvement. In this particular case, the improvement can be achieved by an elaborate choice of the set of bipartite EWs, instead of using Lemma 1 only. If the bipartite EWs for 13|24 and 14|23 in the above construction are replaced by\nW13|24 =|0001\u3009Cl4\u30080001|+ |0100\u3009Cl4\u30080100|+ |0101\u3009Cl4\u30080101|+ |0011\u3009Cl4\u30080011| + |0110\u3009Cl4\u30080110|+ |0111\u3009Cl4\u30080111| \u2212 |Cl4\u3009\u3008Cl4|, W14|23 =|0001\u3009Cl4\u30080001|+ |0010\u3009Cl4\u30080010|+ |0101\u3009Cl4\u30080101|+ |0011\u3009Cl4\u30080011| + |0110\u3009Cl4\u30080110|+ |0111\u3009Cl4\u30080111| \u2212 |Cl4\u3009\u3008Cl4|,\n(67)\nrespectively, one can recover the WoptCl4 with Theorem 1. With this example on 4-qubit cluster state, we highlight that Lemma 1 is just an alternative choice which ends up with robust GME witnesses. Our construction in fact allows a flexible choice on the set of EWs to be lifted to multipartite case, and a suitable choice can further improve its performance. Moreover, it should be remarked that our discussion was based on the partial transposition throughout this paper, to obtain higher noise resistance. If bipartite EWs in the construction are designed by other positive maps (e.g., the Choi\u2019s map), different classes of GME witness can be found. This may help to harness the full potential of Theorem 1 in future work.\nB.3 Multipartite states admitting Schmidt decomposition. A special case of multipartite entangled states is the multipartite states admitting Schmidt decomposition. Without loss of generality, we can assume that such states are of the form |\u03c6s\u3009 = \u2211d\u22121 i=0 \u221a \u03bbi|i\u3009\u2297n with \u03bbi \u2265 0 in decreasing order. Then the Lemma 1 gives a set of bipartite EWs W|\u03c6SD\u3009 A|A\u0304 :\nW |\u03c6SD\u3009 A|A\u0304 = d\u22121\u2211 i,j=0 \u221a \u03bbi\u03bbj |i\u3009\u2297kA|j\u3009 \u2297n\u2212k A\u0304\u3008i| \u2297k A\u3008j| \u2297n\u2212k A\u0304 \u2212 |\u03c6s\u3009\u3008\u03c6s|, (68)\nwhere k = |A| is the number of qudits in subsystem A. For these bipartite EWs, the set S is {\u03c0m(|i\u3009\u2297r|j\u3009\u2297n\u2212r)}r,i,j,\u03c0m \u222a {|l\u3009\u2297n}d\u22121l=0 , (69) with r = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n\u22121, i, j = 0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , d\u22121 (i < j) and \u03c0m being all possible permutations of |i\u3009\u2297r|j\u3009\u2297n\u2212r. Note that all state vectors in S are orthogonal with each other, thus our construction ends up with the following multipartite EW\nW|\u03c6s\u3009 = d\u22121\u2211 i,j=0, i<j n\u22121\u2211 r=1 \u2211 m \u221a \u03bbi\u03bbj\u03c0m(|i\u3009\u2297r|j\u3009\u2297n\u2212r)\u03c0m(\u3008i\u2297r|\u3008j|\u2297n\u2212r)\n+ d\u22121\u2211 i=0 \u03bbi|i\u3009\u3008i|\u2297n \u2212 |\u03c6s\u3009\u3008\u03c6s|,\n(70)\nwhere the summation ofm is over all possible permutations \u03c0m(|i\u3009\u2297r|j\u3009\u2297n\u2212r) of |i\u3009\u2297r|j\u3009\u2297n\u2212r. Moreover, similar to the case of proving the optimality of W|\u03c6\u3009o in the first section, one can verify the optimality of W|\u03c6s\u3009 by checking that all the biseparable states satisfying Tr(W|\u03c6s\u3009\u03c1bs) = 0 span the whole Hilbert space H \u2297n d .\nB.4 GME witness for multi-qubit singlet states Multi-qubit singlet states are of particular experimental interest, while the GME witness for them is less investigated. In this example, it is shown that our framework works well for the multi-qubit singlet states. In the main text, we provide the result for a specific class of four-qubit singlet states. While here we begin with the discussion on general four-qubit singlet states\n|\u03d54\u3009 = a|\u03c8\u221212\u3009 \u2297 |\u03c8 \u2212 34\u3009+ ei\u03b8b|\u03c8 \u2212 13\u3009 \u2297 |\u03c8 \u2212 24\u3009, (71)\nwith the constraint a2 + b2 + cos(\u03b8)ab = 1 and |\u03c8\u221212\u3009 being the two-qubit singlet state (|01\u3009 \u2212 |10\u3009)/ \u221a 2 on the first two qubits. By performing our construction procedure for all four-qubit singlet states, it is observed that the set S is always divided into 5 subsets and the identity operators on the corresponding subspaces are just {P4i }4i=0 (The P4i has been defined below the Eq. (44)). More specifically, the resulting witness is\nW4 = c2P42 + c1(P41 + P43) + c0(P40 + P44)\u2212 |\u03d54\u3009\u3008\u03d54|, (72)\nwith the coefficients decided by\nc2 = max{1\u2212 3 4a 2, 1\u2212 34b 2, 3 4(a 2 + b2)\u2212 12}, c1 = 1 2 , c0 = max{ 1 2 \u2212 1 4(a 2 + b2), 14a 2, 1 4b 2}.\n(73)\nSpecially, with a choice of \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, this recovers the EW in the main text. While if a = \u22121, b = 1 and \u03b8 = 0, |\u03d54\u3009 becomes a biseparable state |\u03c8\u221214\u3009\u2297 |\u03c8 \u2212 23\u3009 and the corresponding EW become positive semidefinite. When the number of qubit grows, achieving a generic expression becomes more complicated. To investigate the GME witness construction in this case, we consider the following six-qubit singlet state\n|\u03d56\u3009 = 1 2 ( |\u03c8\u221212\u3009 \u2297 |\u03c8 \u2212 34\u3009 \u2297 |\u03c8 \u2212 56\u3009+ i|\u03c8 \u2212 13\u3009 \u2297 |\u03c8 \u2212 24\u3009 \u2297 |\u03c8 \u2212 56\u3009\n+i|\u03c8\u221212\u3009 \u2297 |\u03c8 \u2212 35\u3009 \u2297 |\u03c8 \u2212 46\u3009 \u2212 |\u03c8 \u2212 13\u3009 \u2297 |\u03c8 \u2212 25\u3009 \u2297 |\u03c8 \u2212 46\u3009 ) ,\n(74)\nfor which we arrive at the GME witness\nW6 = 5 8P 6 3 + 1 2(P 6 2 + P64) + 1 4(P 6 1 + P65) + 1 8(P 6 0 + P66)\u2212 |\u03d56\u3009\u3008\u03d56|. (75)\nBased on these results, it is reasonable to conjecture that for some 2n-qubit singlet state |\u03d52n\u3009, there exists a GME witness taking the form\nW2n = cnP2nn + n\u22121\u2211 i=0 ci(P2ni + P2n2n\u2212i)\u2212 |\u03d52n\u3009\u3008\u03d52n|. (76)\nwith ci \u2265 ci\u22121 \u2265 0 for i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n and cn is the maximal squared overlap between |\u03d56\u3009 and biseparable states. Moreover, if ci scales with (1/2)\u2212(n\u2212i+1) as in the four- and six-qubit case, a high white noise tolerance tending to 1 can be expected for a large number of qubit."
