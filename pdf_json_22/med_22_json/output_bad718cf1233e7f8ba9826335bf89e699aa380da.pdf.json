While CT angiography (CTA) is the preferred method for the anatomic evaluation of coronary arteries (3), cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) also plays an important role in myocardial tissue characterization for treatment strategy.

The patient had experienced flu-like symptoms 2 months before being suspicious of the COVID-19 infection. Outpatient workup revealed significantly dilated left ventricle (LV) and impaired systolic LV function with an EF of 20\u201325% and severe functional mitral regurgitation (MR). On physical examination, S1, S2, and S3 were audible with an early systolic grade 4 murmur. The patient\u2019s lungs were clear. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia (150 bpm) and deep Q waves in leads I, AVL, V4, V5, and V6 in favor of chronic LV myocardial injury (Figure 1). Cardiac troponin, ESR, and CRP levels were normal. The ProBNP level increased (1,950 pg/ml) and COVID-19 PCR was tested negative.\nCardiac magnetic resonance was performed to investigate the possible underlying pathology, which confirmed severe LV dilation, severely reduced systolic function (LVEF: 22%), and severe MR (Figure 2). Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) sequence demonstrated subendocardial to transmural scar in\nthe basal and especially at the mid anterior and anteroseptal segments, raising suspicion of an ischemic insult. Gated CT coronary angiography (Figure 3) demonstrated an absent LM stem with a centripetal filling of the small caliber confluent LAD and circumflex, likely from collaterals from a dilated right coronary artery. Angiography confirmed the LM atresia with a retrograde collateral filling of LAD and LCX arteries from a dominant RCA. There was no connection to the pulmonary arterial branches (Figure 4; Supplementary Videos 1, 2). Considering the extent of myocardial fibrosis, smallsized coronary arteries and LV remodeling were required, and according to the decision of heart team specialists, the patient underwent medical treatment for heart failure and was scheduled for a heart transplant."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first LMCAA case suspected initially from the findings of CMR of characteristic ischemic LGE pattern and further confirmed by the CTA and invasive angiography.\nThe left main coronary artery atresia is one of the rarest congenital coronary anomalies with <100 reported cases, in which an enlarged RCA is responsible to provide perfusion for the left system via collaterals. The clinical presentation depends mostly on the capacity and size of collateral arteries and the site of their connection to the left system and is variable from asymptomatic to congestive heart failure, syncope, and sudden cardiac death (SCD) (2, 4). Small and distally connected collaterals are indicative of poor outcomes compared to larger, more prominent, and proximally connected ones (1).\nA case series study with a review of the literature, which was published in 2019, analyzed previously reported cases of 50 pediatric patients and 45 adult patients with LMCAA. In total, 88% of the pediatric group was symptomatic while 79% of the adult group was symptomatic. Heart failure was reported to be the most common finding in pediatric patients occurring in 44%, followed by syncope (28%). In the adult group, angina was the most prevalent symptom (48.8%) followed by exertional dyspnea (14%). Sudden cardiac death was reported in 10 and 7% of the pediatric and adult groups, respectively (2).\nThe coronary artery anatomy and anomalous origins are best visualized with multislice CTA due to its high spatial resolution and reconstruction techniques (3). Invasive angiography is used to help confirm the diagnosis (1, 2).\nDifferentiating LMCAA from other conflicting diagnoses such as absent LM with a single coronary artery, an anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA), and secondary occlusion of LM coronary artery is crucial (Supplementary Table 1).\nThe left main coronary artery atresia is completely different from absent LM with a single coronary artery, which occurs in <1% of congenital coronary anomalies (5). It is a condition\nFrontiers inCardiovascularMedicine 02 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 3 Maximum intensity projection (A) and volume rendered (B) CT images demonstrate an absence of the LM artery with proximally connected left anterior descending artery (LAD) and left circumflex artery (LCX).\nwhere a single ostium coronary artery from the aortic trunk may have either RCA or LM origin and divides proximally to take a normal RCA/LCA course or a totally different coronary tree\nwith the antegrade flow (6). This is mostly taken as a normal variation since it rarely causes symptoms (7). In both LMCAA and single coronary with right coronary cusp origin, RCA is dilated; however, in LMCAA, the blood supply to the left system is retrogradely perfused by collaterals (1).\nAnother common misdiagnosis for LMCAA is ALCAPA occurring in 1 in 300,000 live births (3). A total of 26% of pediatric patients reported in Alsalehi et al.\u2019s (2) review were first misdiagnosed with ALCAPA. In both ALCAPA and LMCAA, RCA is dilated; however, in ALCAPA, the proximal part of the left system finally drains to the pulmonary artery. An accurate diagnosis of LMCAA from ALCAPAS is important for preoperative planning and pulmonary artery division (2, 6).\nAn anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery causes chronic ongoing myocardial hypoperfusion leading to myocardial hibernation, which dramatically improves after coronary reimplantation (6, 8). CMR has the advantage of distinguishing hibernated from irreversibly infarcted myocardium (9). In a case series of patients with ALCAPA undergoing CMR, only 25% of patients with ALCAPA showed scar in their LGE sequence, which validated the\nFrontiers inCardiovascularMedicine 03 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 4 Invasive angiography (A\u2013C) showing the dominant RCA [Thick arrow in (A)] retrogradely filling the left system via collaterals [Thin arrows in (B)] and no antegrade flow in left cusp injection (C) confirming left main atresia (arrowhead).\nfact that myocardium is mainly viable despite depressed ventricular function (8). Nonetheless, no CMR or clinical data in patients with LMCAA on myocardial viability or functional reversibility after revascularization have been reported to this date. Regarding the retrograde flow dynamic pattern of coronary arteries in both LMCAA and ALCAPA, the ischemic scar might have basal/mid LV segment predilection due to more downstream locations in the retrograde perfusion pathway. However, further investigation is required for a thorough assessment.\nTotal occlusion of the LM has a relatively similar manifestation to LMCAA as demonstrated in reported cases of arteritis by Takayasu (10) and Kawasaki (11); Crosssectional imaging often reveals the occluded portion, sometimes accompanied by adjacent aortic wall thickening.\nPatients with LMCAA should undergo surgical correction with the restoration of the antegrade flow to the left coronary system either by osteoplasty or bypass grafting. Otherwise, the condition deteriorates gradually with a poor outcome. In instances in which reperfusion is not possible (due to small coronary artery diameter) or not effective (due to extensive transmural myocardial scar), the treatment strategy will focus on heart failure management till the provision of condition for heart transplantation as the last remaining option."
