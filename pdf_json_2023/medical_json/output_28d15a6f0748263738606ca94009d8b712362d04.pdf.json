    "abstractText": "Post\u2010acute COVID\u201019 (PACS) are associated with cardiovascular dysfunction, especially postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Patients with PACS, both in the absence or presence of POTS, exhibit a wide range of persisting symptoms long after the acute infection. Some of these symptoms may stem from alterations in cardiovascular homeostasis, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to provide a broad molecular characterization of patients with PACS with (PACS + POTS) and without (PACS\u2010POTS) POTS compared to healthy subjects, including a broad proteomic characterization with a focus on plasma cardiometabolic proteins, quantification of cytokines/chemokines and determination of plasma sphingolipid levels. Twenty\u2010one healthy subjects without a prior COVID\u201019 infection (mean age 43 years, 95% females), 20 non\u2010hospitalized patients with PACS + POTS (mean age 39 years, 95% females) and 22 non\u2010 hospitalized patients with PACS\u2010POTS (mean age 44 years, 100% females) were studied. PACS patients were non\u2010hospitalized and recruited \u224818 months after the acute infection. Cardiometabolic proteomic analyses revealed a dysregulation of \u2248200 out of 700 analyzed proteins in both PACS groups vs. healthy subjects with the majority (> 90%) being upregulated. There was a large overlap (> 90%) with no major differences between the PACS groups. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed alterations in hemostasis/coagulation, metabolism, immune responses, and angiogenesis in PACS vs. healthy controls. Furthermore, 11 out of 33 cytokines/chemokines were significantly upregulated both in PACS + POTS and PACS\u2010POTS vs. healthy controls and none of the cytokines were downregulated. There were no differences in between the PACS groups in the cytokine levels. Lastly, 16 and 19 out OPEN",

Patients with PACS, both in the absence or presence of POTS, exhibit a wide range of persisting symptoms long after the acute infection. Some of these symptoms may stem from alterations in cardiovascular homeostasis, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to provide a broad molecular characterization of patients with PACS with (PACS + POTS) and without (PACS\u2011POTS) POTS compared to healthy subjects, including a broad proteomic characterization with a focus on plasma cardiometabolic proteins, quantification of cytokines/chemokines and determination of plasma sphingolipid levels. Twenty\u2011one healthy subjects without a prior COVID\u201119 infection (mean age 43 years, 95% females), 20 non\u2011hospitalized patients with PACS + POTS (mean age 39 years, 95% females) and 22 non\u2011 hospitalized patients with PACS\u2011POTS (mean age 44 years, 100% females) were studied.

While most infected individuals recover fully within a few weeks, some experience symptoms that persist for months after acute infection or develop symptoms after a short period of recovery. This novel condition is referred to as post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS)1 and is defined as persisting symptoms > 12\u00a0weeks after contracting an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection2. It is estimated that the prevalence of PACS is approximately 10% among non-hospitalized patients with a mild acute infection3,4. PACS is a complex and multi-faceted condition that can affect various organ systems, including the respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological and musculoskeletal systems1. Some of the most common symptoms of PACS include fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, joint and muscle pain, palpitations and cognitive impairment. However, the pathophysiology underlying PACS is to this date incompletely understood and needs further investigation. We were among the first to report that PACS can be associated with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)5 and have highlighted the importance of cardiovascular dysautonomia in this patient population2. A recent study estimates the prevalence of POTS to be 30% in severely affected PACS patients referred to a tertiary specialist center6. More recently we have shown that POTS associated with PACS is accompanied with microvascular endothelial dysfunction which translates into reduced endothelial dependent cardiac stress perfusion7.\nThe pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PACS remain unknown but proposed causes are persisting SARS-CoV-2 virus, immune system dysregulation, autoimmunity, endothelial cell inflammation (endotheliitis) associated with micro clot formation or neurological dysregulation8. The clinical and pathophysiological association between PACS and POTS also remain elusive. While the prevalence of POTS in PACS has been reported in case series9, detailed studies exploring pathological mechanisms underlying PACS-related POTS are lacking. Possible overlap, but also distinctions among various PACS phenotypes, including POTS and other forms of cardiovascular complications, might exist. Thus, additional knowledge regarding alterations in key signaling pathways is needed to improve our understanding of this complex condition.\nTherefore, we sought to provide a foundation for future mechanistic studies by applying an unbiased, multiomic approach analyzing cardiometabolic plasma proteins, proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and sphingolipids in patients with PACS with and without POTS compared to healthy controls. Our hypothesis posits significant molecular changes in PACS, particularly in cases associated with POTS, aiming to lay a foundation for future mechanistic studies and enhance our understanding of these intricate conditions."

All subjects were diagnosed with PACS by a multidisciplinary team in accordance with the current WHO definition10 and underwent a head-up TILT test due to clinical suspicion of POTS11. All patients were referred to the multidisciplinary clinic due to prolonged and disabling symptoms with at least 50% sick-leave for at least six months after the acute COVID-19 illness. Subjects were stratified according to the presence (n = 20) (PACS + POTS) or absence (n = 22) (PACS-POTS) of POTS defined as a persistent rise in heart rate of > 30 beats/min or a heart rate > 120 beats/min within 10\u00a0min of tilt-up test in line with current diagnostic guideline criteria for POTS12. The subjects were recruited consecutively with the aim of recruiting 50% with and 50% without POTS. This was an exploratory study based on a patient series collected at tertiary center and age and sex matched controls in 2:1 ratio as usually applied in unbiased exploratory studies. As part of the clinical evaluation, all subjects underwent an ambulatory 24-h Holter electrocardiogram and mean frequency over 24\u00a0h was collected.

For sphingolipids with a standard available, an injection of the standard was used to assess the retention time for the selected SRM. For sphingolipids without a standard available, retention time was predicted based on their number of carbons and unsaturations relative to compounds calibrated with a standard. Specific information on SRM, retention times and compound information are detailed in Supplementary File 4.

This analysis showed only minor differences between the PACS + POTS and PACS-POTS groups, as there were 11 and 8 uniquely upregulated proteins for the PACS + POTS and PACS-POTS groups, respectively, as well as 6 and 3 uniquely downregulated proteins for the PACS + POTS and PACS-POTS groups, respectively (Fig.\u00a04B,C). These proteins are listed in Supplementary File 1. Taken together, PACS patients had a clearly dysregulated plasma proteome with a substantial proportion (almost 30%) of dysregulated proteins compared to healthy controls, but there were no major differences between PACS patients with or without POTS."

As there was no difference between the PACS + POTS and PACS-POTS groups, we combined the data from these groups and analyzed them vs. healthy controls. Gene ontology (GO) pathway enrichment analysis led to a large amount of significantly altered pathways, including processes involved in hemostasis, inflammation, amino acid metabolism and apoptosis (Fig.\u00a05A\u2013D). Network plots were then used to depict which specific proteins were altered in each pathway. Interestingly, for hemostasis and coagulation, we found that key proteins such as SERPINE1 (also known as plasminogen activator inhibitor 1) were strongly upregulated in PACS patients, implying increases in clotting susceptibility (Fig.\u00a05A). Moreover, CCL5, a chemokine often expressed by T-cells involved in inflammation, was upregulated in PACS patients (Fig.\u00a05B), implying a key role of T-cells in the hyperinflammatory response often seen in PACS patients. Finally, amino acid metabolism seemed to be increased with expansion of key amino acid metabolic enzymes (Fig.\u00a05C), whilst key apoptotic markers such as Caspase 3 and DIABLO were upregulated in PACS patients (Fig.\u00a05D), indicating activation of apoptotic processes."

            "heading": "Plasma sphingolipid profiling",
            "text": "It has previously been shown that sphingolipids, in particular ceramides, represent potential drivers of cardiovascular disease through various actions, including accumulation in tissues relevant for cardiovascular disease such as the vasculature and the heart with adverse metabolic regulation17. A proposed key-mechanism by which sphingolipids act as mediators of cardiovascular disease is through their pleiotropic effect as inhibitors of nitric oxide formation and increased production of reactive oxygen species17,18. Since our previous work showed that PACS + POTS patients frequently presented with microvascular dysfunction (MVD), we hypothesized that sphingolipid-related dysregulation could accompany POTS and/or MVD in PACS patients. Using a targeted LC\u2013MS based lipidomic approach specifically for sphingolipid detection, we analyzed a total of 88 sphingolipids in our cohort.\nAgain, we analyzed the data to identify differentially expressed lipids between the groups. Compared to healthy controls, we found 16 and 19 dysregulated lipids out of 88 in the PACS + POTS and PACS-POTS groups, respectively (Fig.\u00a08A,B). Moreover, no significant differences were detected between PACS-POTS and PACS + POTS groups (Fig.\u00a08C). A few of the most upregulated sphingolipids in both PACS groups are sphingosine (d18:1) and sphingosine (d16:1) which are the basis of sphingolipids, and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) with diverse bioactive actions including critical roles in the immune system, blood pressure and endothelial function19,20. Interestingly, PCA analysis once again showed a clear cluster between healthy controls and PACS patients but failed to differentiate PACS-POTS from PACS + POTS group, further highlighting the similarities in plasma composition in both PACS-POTS and PACS + POTS groups (Fig.\u00a09A). There were only two unique significantly upregulated lipids in both groups, as well as 2 and 5 unique significantly downregulated lipids in PACS + POTS and PACS-POTS groups, respectively (Fig.\u00a09B,C). Similar to the plasma proteins and cytokines, unsupervised hierarchical clustering resulted in a clear cluster of healthy controls, but no major clusters among PACS-POTS and PACS + POTS patients (Fig.\u00a09D). All sphingolipids with associated log2-fold changes, raw p-values and adjusted p-values and the uniquely dysregulated sphingolipids are listed in Supplementary File 3. None of the sphingolipids fell below the LOD.\nCollectively, our data show clear dysregulation of the molecular plasma profile in PACS patients. This is most pronounced in cardiometabolic proteins but also in cytokines and sphingolipids compared to healthy controls (Fig.\u00a01). Interestingly, all analyses showed a similar picture with absence of major differences between PACS patients with and without POTS. The common denominator for the outcomes of all molecular analysis is the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory proteins/molecules of importance for maintaining hemostasis, metabolism, clot formation and vascular function."

            "text": "In the current study, we aimed at providing a molecular multi-omic characterization of cardiometabolic plasma proteins, cytokines/chemokines, and sphingolipids in PACS patients with and without POTS. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first broad molecular characterization of PACS patients with a distinct POTS phenotype. We identified ~ 200 proteins, 11 cytokines and 16\u201319 sphingolipids with altered levels in previously healthy non-hospitalized PACS-patients up to 18\u00a0months after contracting a relatively mild-to-moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, although major differences were detected across all analyses between healthy controls and PACS patients, the presence of POTS did not impact any of the molecular alterations seen in the group as a whole and did not differ in major aspects from the absence of POTS. Contrary to our hypothesis, this suggests that PACS is associated with distinct molecular changes regardless of POTS occurrence. Therefore, the presence of POTS in PACS may not be related with dysregulation of plasma proteins, cytokines, or sphingolipids, at least not at the discrimination level used in the current study.\nFigure\u00a08.

Non-significant (grey) and significant (red) changes are shown. Adjusted p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n10\nVol:.(1234567890)\nScientific Reports | (2023) 13:20230 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-47539-1\nIt is well-known that COVID-19 infection triggers a hyperinflammatory response during the acute phase of the infection. The majority of COVIDomics studies on patients with acute COVID-19 have shown that a proinflammatory and pro-coagulative signature is dominant and probably drives cardiovascular perturbations and complications during ongoing illness21. These observations are extended in the current study which suggests that patients with PACS exhibit persistent and prolonged immune activation and dysregulation of coagulation pathways that may contribute to symptom perseverance in PACS, even 18\u00a0months after a mild acute infection. This is further corroborated by the strong dysregulation of cytokines seen in PACS patients, with important chemokines such as CCL8, CCL1322 and CXCL1123 being upregulated, showing an overall activation of the inflammatory response.\nOur results suggest that alterations in hemostasis and apoptosis might play a key role in the PACS pathophysiology as several proteins involved in platelet activation and coagulation were dysregulated in PACS. This supports previous observations of COVID-19 convalescents who demonstrated microvascular endothelial dysfunction7,24 associated with a hypercoagulable state including platelet activation and micro-clotting25,26. Interestingly, previous studies have also shown dysregulation of proteins involved in platelet activation and coagulation in POTS patients without PACS27 highlighting the importance of hemostasis in POTS. Whether platelet activation and increased thrombogenicity induced by microvascular endothelial dysfunction constitute an amendable pathophysiological mechanism should be explored in future studies.\nInterestingly, the cytokine profiling also revealed upregulation of several pro-proliferatory and pro-angiogenetic factors such as VEGF-A, EGF and TNFSF1228\u201330. Some of the previously mentioned chemokines like CCL8 have also been shown to promote angiogenesis31. Our proteomics dataset showed clear upregulation of PDGF-A in PACS, another potential player in angiogenesis32. This, together with the concurrent increases in apoptotic and hemostatic proteins, could signal that PACS patients suffer from a hypoxic environment caused by micro clots, leading to apoptosis which in turn upregulates angiogenesis to alleviate the consequences of hypoxia. This seemingly strong upregulation of angiogenic signaling is one of many potential aspects of PACS that needs to be further evaluated.\nThe bioactive sphingolipids, ceramides, are known to act as secondary messengers and mediate important cellular and molecular signaling. It has been shown that several ceramides predict adverse cardiovascular events with high accuracy33 possibly through their diverse regulatory effects on vascular reactivity18. More specifically, S1P, which was upregulated in our cohort, is associated with elevated blood pressure and proinflammatory biomarkers19. As they accumulate in the atherosclerotic plaque, ceramides have been implicated in the onset of lipoprotein aggregation and inflammation34. However, four sphingolipids implicated in cardiovascular disease as predictors of cardiovascular death in a population with coronary artery disease, namely: Cer(d18:1/16:0), Cer(d18:1/18:0), Cer(d18:1/24:1) and Cer(d18:1/24:0) were not significantly dysregulated in the groups compared35. This might suggest that these ceramides are implicated in plaque vulnerability in patients\nFigure\u00a09. Principal component analysis (PCA) plot colored by sample group for sphingolipids (A).

However, the subjects included in the current study do not have known or at risk for coronary artery disease, which might explain the lack of dysregulation of these certain ceramides. Beyond the cardiovascular system, sphingolipids have been implicated in the cellular processes of skeletal muscle cells36. Hence, the observation of persistent alterations of sphingolipids in PACS may not only suggest a predisposition to cardiovascular disease but also to chronic fatigue among PACS patients. However, the potential impact of these alterations on plaque formation and muscle fatigue remains to be established in larger cohorts with longer follow-up.\nWe found very small differences in protein, cytokine and sphingolipid dysregulation between PACS patients with and without POTS. This suggests that POTS may exist on the background of biochemical alterations related primarily to PACS. What specific mechanisms cause development of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in general, and POTS in particular, on top of PACS, could not be established. We speculate that since acute COVID-19 is known to trigger a profound autoimmune response37,38 and there is evidence of autoimmunity being a potential disease mechanism in classical POTS39,40, autoimmune factors may be decisive for POTS development in PACS.\nCollectively, our findings from a large proteomic analysis, cytokine profiling and sphingolipid quantification suggest major alterations of importance in mediating pro-inflammatory signaling in PACS. Future studies should confirm the findings in larger cohorts, assess the prognostic value of the observed changes, investigate the association of the dysregulated molecules to clinical symptoms and most importantly investigate the potential therapeutic targets aiming at restoring the observed changes. The current study suggests that such targets might include anti-inflammatory therapies, immunotherapies, and anticoagulants. Indeed, drugs targeting inflammation, the immune system and the coagulation cascade with promising results have been performed or are currently under investigation (NCT: 05823896)41,42. The overlap in COVIDomics21 between the acute infection and PACS not only suggest a prolonged activation of a pro-inflammatory, pro-coagulative and immune activation state, but also that beneficial pharmacological targets in the acute infection might also alleviate and reduce the symptom burden in PACS."

            "heading": "Limitations",
            "text": "This study has several limitations. The results of the study are based on associations between molecular dysregulation and clinical phenotypes, and any causative relationship should be interpreted with great caution. The limited sample size does not allow for in depth analysis of associations of molecular dysregulations and clinical symptoms. Moreover, the analyses in this study were targeted and thereby limited, which means that we may have missed several important plasma proteins, cytokines, and lipids. Furthermore, we cannot rule out that protein, cytokine, and sphingolipid dysregulation also exist long-term after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination also in asymptomatic patients i.e. in individuals who did not develop PACS. Hence, these results should be verified using a control group that have had SARS-CoV-2 infection with a complete recovery. An additional limitation is that PACS patients in this study contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first and second pandemic wave. The virus has since mutated, mass vaccination has been performed in many countries and anti-viral treatment is indicated in some patients with risk factors for severe COVID-19. Therefore, the results from this study may not be directly extrapolated to later cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections and in vaccinated patients or patients with anti-viral treatment during the acute phase of COVID-19. However, including patients from the first and second wave offer a unique opportunity to document the natural progression of PACS, which represents a strength of this study. The study was almost exclusively performed on female patients, hence extrapolation to male patients should be made cautiously. For unknown reasons, females contracting COVID-19 are more likely to suffer from PACS43. Finally, the study is limited in size without validation of the dysregulated proteins, cytokines, and sphingolipids by other methods."

In particular, alterations in hemostasis, T-cell proliferation, apoptosis and amino acid metabolism may be potentially involved in symptom development and maintenance in PACS. Interestingly, plasma profile of PACS patients with and without POTS do not substantially differ, implying that PACS is associated with alterations in plasma profile regardless of POTS presence. Other pathophysiological mechanisms may be responsible for the development of POTS in PACS. Collectively our data suggest that the pro-inflammatory/ proliferative and pro-coagulative state in PACS represents an important phenotype in the pathophysiology of the disease and might largely explain the disease burden of the population. This may lay the foundation for future clinical investigations with focus on inflammation resolution, resolution of micro clots and rearrange the hemostasis to alleviate the disease burden or dissect possible biomarkers for disease progression in PACS."
