1. **Investigate the effects of different types of funny videos on students' learning outcomes.** For example, researchers could compare the effects of videos that are relevant to the learning material to videos that are not relevant. They could also compare the effects of videos that are short and funny to videos that are long and funny.


2. **Examine the effects of pre-learning emotions on students' learning outcomes in different cultural contexts.** For example, researchers could compare the effects of pre-learning emotions on students' learning outcomes in Western cultures to the effects of pre-learning emotions on students' learning outcomes in Eastern cultures.


3. **Investigate the effects of pre-learning emotions on students' learning outcomes in different age groups.** For example, researchers could compare the effects of pre-learning emotions on students' learning outcomes in elementary school students to the effects of pre-learning emotions on students' learning outcomes in high school students.


4. **Examine the effects of pre-learning emotions on students' learning outcomes in different subject areas.** For example, researchers could compare the effects of pre-learning emotions on students' learning outcomes in math to the effects of pre-learning emotions on students' learning outcomes in science.


5. **Investigate the effects of pre-learning emotions on students' learning outcomes in different learning environments.** For example, researchers could compare the effects of pre-learning emotions on students' learning outcomes in traditional classroom settings to the effects of pre-learning emotions on students' learning outcomes in online learning environments.
