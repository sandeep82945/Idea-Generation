    "abstractText": "The lack of cost\u2010effective methods for producing antimicrobial peptides has made it impossible to use their high potential as a new and powerful class of antimicrobial agents. In recent years, extensive research has been conducted to decrease the cost of recombinant proteins production through microorganisms, transgenic animals, and plants. Well\u2010known genetic and physiological characteristics, short\u2010term proliferation, and ease of manipulation make E. coli expression system a valuable host for recombinant proteins production. Expression in periplasmic space is recommended to reduce the inherently destructive behavior of antimicrobial peptides against the expressing microorganism and to decline susceptibility to proteolytic degradation. In this study, a pET\u2010based expression system was used to express buforin I at E. coli periplasmic space, and its antimicrobial, hemolytic, and cell toxicity activities as well as structural stability were evaluated. The hemolysis activity and cytotoxicity of His\u2010tagged buforin I were negligible and its antimicrobial activity did not show a significant difference compared to synthetic buforin I. In addition, in silico investigating of stability of native and His\u2010tagged buforin I showed that RMSF, RMSD and Rg curves had followed a similar trend during 150 ns simulation. Furthermore, evaluating the modelled structures, FTIR and X\u2010ray methods of both peptides indicated an insignificant structural difference. It was concluded that the recombinant buforin I could be a viable alternative to some currently used antibiotics by successfully expressing it in the pET\u2010based expression system.",

In recent years, extensive research has been conducted to decrease the cost of recombinant proteins production through microorganisms, transgenic animals, and plants. Well\u2011known genetic and physiological characteristics, short\u2011term proliferation, and ease of manipulation make E. coli expression system a valuable host for recombinant proteins production. Expression in periplasmic space is recommended to reduce the inherently destructive behavior of antimicrobial peptides against the expressing microorganism and to decline susceptibility to proteolytic degradation. In this study, a pET\u2011based expression system was used to express buforin I at E. coli periplasmic space, and its antimicrobial, hemolytic, and cell toxicity activities as well as structural stability were evaluated. The hemolysis activity and cytotoxicity of His\u2011tagged buforin I were negligible and its antimicrobial activity did not show a significant difference compared to synthetic buforin I. In addition, in silico investigating of stability of native and His\u2011tagged buforin I showed that RMSF, RMSD and Rg curves had followed a similar trend during 150 ns simulation. Furthermore, evaluating the modelled structures, FTIR and X\u2011ray methods of both peptides indicated an insignificant structural difference. It was concluded that the recombinant buforin I could be a viable alternative to some currently used antibiotics by successfully expressing it in the pET\u2011based expression system.\nAs a result of the overuse of antibiotics, antibiotic-resistant bacteria have become a global threat. Many researchers are taking an interest in antimicrobial peptides (AMP) as a response to this global challenge. Antimicrobial peptides show potential activity against mechanisms of resistance to antibiotic compounds. Because they have a great ability to kill bacterial cells1. Microorganisms from viruses to parasites are targeted by these agents. AMPs are interesting because they are capable of selectively disrupting bacterial cells without affecting mammalian cells2. In addition to the benefits of AMPs, the cost of making antimicrobial peptides is high. Using recombinant DNA technology, large quantities of these compounds can be produced at a relatively low cost3.\nIn many organisms, non-specific defense barriers are created against pathogens using cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAPs). CAPs are positively charged, and 50% of their amino acids are hydrophobic. Lysine and arginine are two basic amino acids that lead to their positive charge4. The rapid antimicrobial performance and resistance to adverse conditions of cationic antimicrobial peptides make them a promising new class of antimicrobial compounds5. The histone-derived peptide family of antimicrobial peptides do not contribute to DNA replication. The extracellular histone derivatives have strong antimicrobial properties, and the buforin family\nOPEN\n1Department of Food Science and Technology, Faculty of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran. 2Department of Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. 3Department of Animal Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Azadi Square, Mashhad 9177948974, Razavi Khorasan Province, Iran. 4Industrial Biotechnology Research Group, Research Institute of Biotechnology, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran. *email: javadmanesh@ um.ac.ir\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:5508 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32782-3\nincluding buforin I, buforin II, buforin EC, parasin I, abhisin, hipposin, harriotin, and histonin had classified as histone-derived peptides. A purified and characterized buforin I from an Asian toad\u2019s stomach demonstrated strong antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungal strains6. Our previous studies showed that buforin I has high and board spectrum antimicrobial6,7, biofilm formation and biofilm radiation activities with high therapeutic index. Buforin I\u2019s safety is confirmed by the lack of cell cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity7. Accordingly, Cationic antimicrobial peptides like buforin I, are being developed as a promising class of antimicrobial substances2.\nE. coli is the most common host for AMP expression, due to its high growth rate and known expression systems. It is nevertheless necessary to address some issues such as low yield, proteolytic degradation of hybrid protein, and toxicity of the product produced in the host8. To overcome these problems, some methods have been proposed, including hybrid expression, vector construction containing multiple linked genes, added anionic fragments for neutralizing cationic peptides, and periplasmic expression9,10.\nIn periplasmic expression, a peptide signal is used to direct the expressed protein to the host periplasmic space11 and the recombinant proteins that extracted from the periplasmic space could purify by using nickel affinity chromatography (Ni\u2013NTA)9. Therefore, an affinity tag with six consecutive histidine residues is known as a poly-histidine affinity tag, or His6; it can range in length from two to ten histidine residues; must be added to the N-terminal of proteins12. Histidine tags have been demonstrated to facilitate the purification of proteins of interest and enhance their refolding, solubility, and stability. While fused tags have numerous advantages, they can alter the biophysical properties of recombinant proteins. There has been evidence of structural and functional differences between histidine-tagged and untagged forms of the same protein13.\nTherefore, this study was performed with the aim of recombinant production of this peptide using the method of periplasmic expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3) by using pET-based IPTG-inducible system and evaluating the effect of the presence of histidine-tag on antimicrobial, hemolytic and cytotoxic activities, in addition, stability and structure of recombinant buforin I. The purpose of conducting this research, the general outline of its conduct and the results obtained from it, are summarized in the Fig.\u00a01."

            "text": "Confirmation of the presence of the gene in the plasmid. The gene map of the expression vector pET22 b (+) was showed in Fig.\u00a02. The buforin I DNA sequence is located between the cleavage site of XhoI and NcoI enzymes. The synthesized sequence of buforin I was inserted into the plasmid pET22 b (+) using XhoI and NcoI enzymes.\nThus, the recombinant plasmid pET22b (+) -BUF was constructed. This recombinant plasmid was transferred to E. coli DH5\u03b1. Bacteria with recombinant peptides had the ability to form colonies on antibiotic-containing media (Fig.\u00a03B), while, there was no colony formation by bacteria without recombinant plasmid on the medium containing ampicillin (Fig.\u00a03A).\nColony PCR was performed from colonies grown on ampicillin-containing medium to confirm the presence of recombinant plasmid. Figure\u00a03C, showed the colony PCR amplification of the transformed host strain on 1% agarose gel. In the recombinant plasmid pET22b (+)-BUF, a fragment with a length of 376\u00a0bp and in the native plasmid pET22 b (+), a fragment with a length of 308\u00a0bp were amplified. Plasmid-free E. coli DH5\u03b1 was used as a negative control.\nPlasmid extraction was performed from E. coli DH5\u03b1 bacteria containing recombinant plasmid pET22 b (+)-BUF using a commercial plasmid extraction kit. Qualitative and quantitative plasmid content was evaluated by the nanodrop device. The recombinant plasmid concentration was 461.89\u00a0ng/\u00b5l and its adsorption ratio at 260 to 280 was 1.973. Figure\u00a04-A showed the gel electrophoresis of recombinant plasmid pET22 b ( +)-BUF and plasmid pET 22b (+) on 1% gel. The size of these plasmids were for the recombinant plasmid pET22 b (+)- BUF and the plasmid pET 22b ( +), 5554\u00a0bp and 5493 pb, respectively, which were consistent with the results predicted with the Snap Gene software. The enzymatic digestion of the recombinant pET22 b (+)-BUF plasmid with the two enzymes NcoI and XhoI and the undigested pET22 b (+) plasmid electrophoresed and visualized on a 1% agarose gel (Fig.\u00a04B).\nExpression of buforin I in the periplasmic space of E. coli BL21. In order to evaluate the production of recombinant protein in the expression system, the relevant samples were evaluated at 2\u00a0h intervals after the addition of IPTG on SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). The profile of buforin I expression in E. coli BL21 at intervals of 0, 2, 4, and 6\u00a0h after the addition of IPTG is showed in Fig.\u00a05A. There was a band approximately with the size of 5\u00a0kDa, whose intensity increases from zero to 6\u00a0h. Figure\u00a04B, shows the result of the western blot test. The band with the size of 5\u00a0kDa on the nitrocellulose paper confirmed the expression of buforin I in E. coli BL21 (DE) containing the recombinant plasmid pET22b (+)-BUF (Fig.\u00a05B). The brown color band formed on nitrocellulose paper is due to the enzymatic reaction of DAB with the enzyme superoxide dismutase, which binds to the anti-histogram monoclonal antibody (Images of agarose gels, SDSPAGE, and Western blot can be accessed separately as supplementary information).\nPurification and quantification of buforin I. Research has shown that the tendency of the amino acid histidine to bind to the nickel metal is high. Protein purification is possible by adding 6 to 8 histidines at the carboxyl or amino terminus of the protein12. As shown in Fig.\u00a06, from Elution 1 to Elution 4, the intensity of the background bands is reduced. Therefore, the purity of the recombinant protein was considerably high. According to the protein marker, the molecular weight of the purified recombinant protein was about 5\u00a0kDa. The production efficiency of buforin I peptide in this study using Bradford method was estimated around 0.327\u00a0\u00b5g/mL. Elution 3 containing the recombinant buforin I was freeze-dried and stored at \u2212 20 \u00b0C for next experiments. In\n3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:5508 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32782-3\naddition, the result of HPLC analysis showed that the purity of recombinant buforin I was 94.64% and confirmed its authenticity and integrity (Fig.\u00a07).\nEvaluation of antimicrobial activity, hemolytic and cytotoxicity activities and therapeutic index. Table\u00a01 showed the results of the antimicrobial effect of recombinant buforin I by MIC assay.\nHemolytic and cytotoxicity activities of buforin I, showed a negligible hemolytic effect or toxicity (Fig.\u00a08). As GM of MIC against tested microbial strains, and MHC were 8.02\u00a0\u00b5g/mL and 800\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, respectively, calculated therapeutic index for recombinant buforin I was 97.54. This value was significantly higher than the value obtained for buforin I (76.73) indicating the greater effectiveness of recombinant buforin I.\nIn silico investigation of physical and chemical features and peptide stability. According to the results of investigation the features of buforin I after adding 6 histidine tags compared with native buforin I which were presented in Table\u00a02, there were not significant differences in PI, net charge, half-life and solubility of both peptides. Amino acid composition of buforin I and recombinant buforin is showed in Table\u00a03.\nThe results of in silico stability investigation of recombinant buforin I and buforin I were presented in Fig.\u00a08. The dynamic behavior of individual amino acid residue of peptides was analyzed using the RMSF value (Fig.\u00a09A). The similarity was observed in pattern of RMSF curves for native buforin I (black curve) and recombinant buforin I (red curve). The RMSD is an assessment of how much the structure of a peptide changes over time in comparison to its initial structure. By increasing his tags, the RMSD patterns did not deviate drastically over\nFigure\u00a01. The outline of this research.\n4 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:5508 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32782-3\n50,000\u00a0ns for both peptides (Fig.\u00a09B). Peptide compactness is measured by the radius of gyration (Rg). The plot of Rg was illustrated for alpha-carbon atoms vs time which is depicted in Fig.\u00a09C. Bothe buforin I and recombinant buforin I maintained their structural compactness during simulation. The insignificant increase in the Rg score confirms the increase in polarity and hydrophilicity (more negative GRAVITY and lower Aliphatic index), also decrease in the globularity of recombinant buforin I in comparison with native buforin I.\nIn vitro peptide stability investigation. As shown in Fig.\u00a010A, buforin I and its recombinant had similar peaks and suggesting that the His tag has no detectable effect on the secondary structure of buforin I. The asymmetric stretching frequencies of the amide I band (1600\u20131700\u00a0 cm\u22121), and N\u2013H band (3200\u20133500\u00a0 cm\u22121) in the FTIR profile reveals the secondary structure of a peptides. Both peptides showed maxima in the Amide I band 1655\u00a0 cm\u22121, which is generally assigned to \u03b1-helix conformation14. This absorption had the corresponding band in the amide II region at 1538\u00a0 cm\u22121. In the amide III region, the 1205\u00a0 cm\u22121 and 1136\u00a0 cm\u22121 peaks confirmed the presence of \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-turn conformers. The \u03b2-turn could be associated with proline present in amino acid sequences which most important amino acid in change chain\u2019s direction and creating loop structure, as a secondary-structural motif in globular proteins15.\nFigure\u00a02.

Production methods and strategies have emerged that focus on both molecular design and the use of recombinant expression in a variety of species17. Strategies for improving antimicrobial peptide production discussed by Deo et\u00a0al.17, are summarized in Table\u00a04.\nPeriplasmic expression of proteins has several important advantages over intracellular expression: (1) toxic or lethal effects of some target proteins can be reduced or eliminated through periplasmic expression; (2) by expressed periplasmically or extracellularly, target proteins can become more solubilized ; (3) an unwanted primary methionine in a protein sequence that it would not normally contain can be prevented by using signal\nMicroorganisms MIC (\u00b5g/mL)\nL. monocytogenes 2\nS. aureus 8\nA. niger 8\nC. albicans 8\nP. aeruginosa 14\nS. aureus (MRSA) 14\nE. coli O157:H7 10\nS.

Pyo et\u00a0al. (2004) and Wang et\u00a0al. (2011) produced buforin II in the E. coli expression host by fusion protein assay. Production yields in these two studies were 1.24\u00a0g of pure buforin II per 10 L of cultured cells and 3.1\u00a0mg/l, respectively. Jang et\u00a0al. (2009) developed buforin II, parasin I, and pexiganan as a conjugated dual systronic expression system. They reported that the production efficiency of each of these peptides was about 100\u00a0mg/l of E. coli culture. Tanhaiean et\u00a0al. (2018) investigated the periplasmic expression of chimera lactoferrin (ID: NP_001290496.1) incorporated into a part of camel lactoferrin (ID: AHJ37525) using plasmid pET22 b (+) in the E. coli BL 21. Their results showed the success of using this expression system. The recombinant peptide had significant antimicrobial potency. The production efficiency of the recombinant peptide was 0.42\u00a0g /L.\nOne of the most important mechanisms to control gene expression in all organisms is mRNA degradation20. This mechanism makes it possible for cells to adapt to their surroundings by responding to environmental signals. The half-life of an mRNA in E. coli varies from 2 to 4\u00a0min for a typical mRNA to 17\u00a0min for an ompA (outer membrane protein) mRNA21. For most mRNAs, the degradation process begins with the endonucleolytic cleavage. The major endonucleases known to degrade mRNAs in E. coli are most often RNase E and rarely RNase III22. Following the action of these two non-selective \u20323-exonuclease enzymes, the polynucleotide phosphorylase and RNase II lead to mRNA degradation. Substrates with \u20325-monophosphate terminus are detected by the RNase E enzyme detection portion23. The formation of the hairpin structure at the \u20325 end of an mRNA causes its faster uptake into the cell translation machine. It also leads to higher stability of the mRNA against exonuclease activity\nFigure\u00a09. In silico assessment of stability of buforin I and recombinant buforin I at 310\u00a0\u00b0K.

Sletta et\u00a0al. (2007) showed that by adding the signal sequence of pel B, ompA and CSP peptides to the beginning of the sequence of three important therapeutic proteins Granulocyte\u2013macrophage Colony-stimulating Factor (GM-CSF), Interferon alpha 2b (IFN-2b) and single-chain antibody variable fragment (scFv-phOx), the expression level of GM-CSF and scFv-phOx in E. coli was 1.7 and 2.3\u00a0g/l, respectively, while IFN-2b expression increased. These results showed that adding the peptide signal sequence to the beginning of the target protein gene sequence could not only direct it to the periplasmic space, but also stimulate mRNA translation. In fact, placement of the signal peptide at the beginning and periplasmic expression of the target protein sequence increases the mRNA half-life, which in turn increases the expression efficiency20.\nThe results of this study showed that the production of buforin I in the periplasmic space of the expression host, E. coli BL21, showed acceptable efficiency (yield = 0.327\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) using pel B as signal peptide and pET22b (+)vector. Therefore, this method could be used as a method to reduce the production costs of this powerful antimicrobial peptide.\nIn our previous study, the antimicrobial effect of native buforin I was assessed against same microbial strains (MIC for L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, A. niger, C. albicans, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus (MRSA), E. coli O157:H7, S. Typhi, K. pneumonia and C. perfringens was 4, 10, 10, 10, 12, 14, 14, 14, 6, and 16 (\u00b5g/mL) of buforin I, respectively)7. As the difference in MICs value for the buforin I and recombinant buforin I for all microbial strains were less than two-fold, the sensitivity levels were considered equal, therefore, there is no significant difference between the antimicrobial effect of recombinant buforin I and synthetic buforin I. This decrease in MIC value can be considered due to the increase in the positive charge of the recombinant buforin I peptide by the addition of the histidine tag25. Despite hemolytic and cytotoxicity activities enhancing by increasing buforin I concentration, this peptide did not exhibit negligible hemolytic effect or toxicity. These results were consistent with our previous study when the peptide\u2019s hemolytic and cytotoxicity activities were evaluated at similar concentrations and by similar methods7.\nThe in silico approaches, such as bioinformatics and data analysis, have been widely used to study peptide behavior in recombinant peptide expression and purification11. The instability index indicates the peptide stability in-vivo as well as in-vitro. An unstable peptide has an instability index of > 40, while a stable peptide has an index of < 4026; then both native and recombinant buforin I considered as unstable. As well as instability index,\nFigure\u00a010. In vitro assessment of stability of buforin I and recombinant buforin I.

A protein\u2019s AI can be expressed as the relative volume captured by its aliphatic side chains (Alanine, Valine, Leucine, Isoleucine). Earlier a good correlation was established between AI and thermo-stability of proteins; having a high AI value indicates that the protein is stable under a wide range of temperatures and has a more flexible structure26. AI for recombinant buforin I and buforin I were 54.22 and 62.56, respectively, the difference were caused by a change in amino acid composition and a decrease in alanine, valine, and leucine percentages in recombinant buforin I. Moreover, peptide hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity was evaluated by the GRAVY score. For each protein, the GRAVY score was determined by dividing the sum of hydropathy values of all amino acids by the number of residues. This score ranges from \u2212 2 to + 2, with a negative score indicating hydrophilicity and a positive score indicating hydrophobicity. Proteins with more negative GRAVY score are considered to be hydrophilic in nature with good solubility and\nTable 4.

GRAVY score of recombinant buforin I was more negative that showed increasing the polarity of peptide in result of adding His tags.\nIn addition of high positive charge of buforin family which facilitates the binding of these molecules to negatively charged extracellular and intracellular targets, presence of proline cause to create hinge-like structure which is necessary for the translocating these molecules from the cell membrane without disrupting the membrane\u2019s structure27. Proline was found to stabilize the a-helical conformation28, as illustrate in Fig.\u00a011A and B, as a rigid amino acid is located in the 26th position and lead to helix structure in both native and recombinant buforin I. It should be noted that the difference between C- score, TM-score and RMSD for native buforin I and recombinant buforin I wasn\u2019t significant. C-score is a confidence score for estimating the quality of predicted models by I-TASSER. It is calculated based on the significance of threading template alignments and the convergence parameters of the structure assembly simulations. The TM-score and RMSD are known standards for measuring structural similarity between two structures which are usually used to measure the accuracy of structure modeling29.These results indicate that increasing the His tag had no effect on the structure and subsequent antimicrobial activity of buforin I. Furthermore, showed the importance of peptide positively charged residues for the initial binding to negatively charged vesicles.\nThe results of the structure stability evaluation of peptides by XRD and FTIR also confirmed above issues. FTIR spectroscopy detects the vibrations in a molecule. Proteins/peptides contain groups with IR active vibrations such as the amide group (i.e., O=C\u2013NH), \u03b1C-H, and residue groups of amino acids. These groups result in several intensive bands in the FTIR spectra. The amide I band around 3300\u00a0 cm-1 is from the N\u2013H stretching vibration in the amide group. The amide I band (mainly from the stretching mode of C=O in the amide group),\nFigure\u00a011.

Among all the amide bands, the position of the amide I band is most sensitive to the conformation (i.e., the secondary structures) change of proteins/peptides and has been widely used to evaluate the fraction of various secondary structures in a protein/peptide30. The result of this study showed \u03b1-helical structure of native buforin I (maxima in the Amide I band 1655\u00a0 cm\u22121) was not affected by adding His-taq to the C-terminal of its amino acid sequence. In addition, the results of the XRD test confirmed the special function of the amino acid proline in creating a hinge in the helical structures of both peptides.\nThere are physical forces such as complementarities between protein surfaces, residue interface propensities, conformational changes, hydrogen bond and van der Waals interactions involved in the physical interactions of proteins, but the electrostatic potentials of proteins could serve as a major basis for their physical interactions. Electrostatic potentials play a major role in their specific physical interactions31. As shown in Fig.\u00a011C and D, change red color in the electrostatic potential of the C-terminal surface of buforin I to blue color in the electrostatic potential of the C-terminal surface of recombinant buforin I indicated the increasing the positive electrostatic potentials that consistent with of the His-taq."

            "text": "The favorable properties of buforin I have led to its use as an alternative to antibiotics in the production of animal, animal, and human infections. Its properties included: thermal stability and stability in 50% human plasma, antimicrobial activity, inhibition of microbial growth for a significant period of time, inhibition of biofilm formation and biofilm destruction, lack of hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity, as well as high therapeutic index. This peptide can also be used as a preservative in the food industry or to prevent the formation and destruction of biofilms in food production lines, medicine and dentistry. However, cationic antimicrobial peptides, such as buforin I, had potential benefits such as broad-spectrum antimicrobial, non-selective performance, thermal stability, and resistance to pH changes. However, their application is limited to two important factors: cost and production efficiency and their sensitivity to proteolytic degradation. In the present study, we tried to introduce an optimal production method by evaluating the feasibility of periplasmic expression of this peptide in E. coli. The results of this study showed a yield of 0.375\u00a0mg/mL of recombinant buforin I in the periplasmic space of this bacterium."

After extraction, plasmid DNA was concentrated via ethanol precipitation32. To confirm the presence of the target gene, the recombinant plasmid was double digested with enzymes XhoI and NcoI. After incubating the digestion reaction at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h, the product of double digestion was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel.

It was sonicated at 25\u00a0W for 30\u00a0s, after resuspension in lysis buffer (20\u00a0mM NaH2PO4, 25\u00a0mM imidazole and 0.5\u00a0M NaCl, pH = 7.4)32. after which the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 4\u00a0\u00b0C at 13000 \u00d7 g for 10\u00a0min, the soluble crude extract was electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE on 12% separating and 5% stacking polyacrylamide gels and Coomassie brilliant blue staining. The expression of recombinant protein was confirmed using western blot assay after transferring proteins from polyacrylamide gel onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using 2% BSA as a blocking solution, anti-poly-histidine antibody (Sigma, USA) and DAB colored substrate34.\nPurification and validation of recombinant peptide. The recombinant peptide extract derived from the periplasmic space injected into the Ni2 + -NTA affinity column (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The column was washed with 20\u00a0mM cold imidazole buffer solution contains 50\u00a0mM NaH2PO4, 300\u00a0mM NaCl, and 20\u00a0mM imidazole. Target proteins were eluted with 250\u00a0mM cold buffer imidazole solution. The concentration of purified protein was assessed by Bradford method32,33 and high-performance liquid chromatography system (HPLC; Agilent 1260) analysis using C18 reversed-phase column (4.6 \u00d7 150\u00a0mm, 3.5\u00a0\u03bcm; Waters, Milford, MA, USA) at 214\u00a0nm.

The synthetic buforin I used as standard, the amino acid sequence of buforin I (NCBI accession number: P55897 and amino acid sequence: AGRGKQGGKVRAKAKTRSSRAGLQFPVGRVHRLLRKGNY) then synthesized by the Mimotopes Company (Australia). One mg of buforin I was dissolved in one mL water and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution (80:20 v/v) and filter-sterilized (0.22\u00a0\u00b5m) to prepare a 1000\u00a0\u00b5g/mL stock solution6.\nInvestigation of the characteristics of recombinant buforin I peptide. Investigation of antimicrobial activity. Antimicrobial effect of recombinant buforin I peptide for S. aurous (ATCC 25923), E. coli O157: H7 (ATCC 35150), Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (ATCC 33591), L. monocytogenes (PTCC 1297), P. aeruginosa(PTCC 1707), K. pneumonia (ATCC 13882), C. perfringens (ATCC 13124), S. Typhi(PTCC 1609), A. niger (PTCC 5010), and C. albican (PTCC 5027) were examined. Microbial strains were incubated for 18 to 24\u00a0h at optimum strain temperature until reaching half McFarland concentration. The minimum concentration of growth inhibitor (MIC) was determined using the standard sequential dilution method. 90\u00a0\u03bcl of the prepared concentrations with 10\u00a0\u03bcl of microbial suspension was incubated in a 96-well plate for 24\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for bacterial strains and 48\u00a0h at 25\u00a0\u00b0C for fungal strains for MIC determination. To determine the MIC, the absorbance at 630\u00a0nm (OD630) was measured by an ELISA reader. The lowest concentration at which no microorganism growth was observed was reported as the minimum concentration of MIC growth inhibitor. No inoculated growth medium was used as a negative control35.\nHemolytic and cytotoxicity activities. To prepare the red blood cells, 4\u00a0ml of fresh human blood (from volunteer donors) was first centrifuged in 50\u00a0\u03bcl of EDTA for 10\u00a0min at 2422\u00a0g. The precipitate was dissolved in 4\u00a0ml of PBS buffer and the resulting solution was centrifuged at 1024\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min. 190\u00a0\u03bcl of the prepared blood suspension was poured into 7\u00a0\u03bcl of 1.5\u00a0ml and 10\u00a0\u03bcl of concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 200, 400\u00a0\u03bcg/ml peptide was added to 5 \u03bcL. 10\u00a0\u03bcl of PBS buffer was added to a microtube as a negative control and 10\u00a0\u03bcl of Triton X100 added to another tube as a positive control. All microtubes were placed in an incubator at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. After 30\u00a0min, the samples were centrifuged at 1919\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min. 100 \u03bcL of the supernatant from the centrifuge was taken, and its volume was reduced to a final volume of 1\u00a0ml by PBS buffer, and then the absorbance of the samples was measured using a spectrophotometer at 570\u00a0nm. The uptake of all blood cells treated with serial concentrations of peptide was measured by spectrophotometer and compared with the uptake of a sample containing Triton, and the percentage of hemolysis was calculated.\nAs sample adsorption, Ac is negative control sample adsorption and A100 is also positive control sample adsorption. A minimum hemolytic concentration (MHC) was defined as the highest concentration of peptide that does not cause hemolysis36.Cytotoxicity evaluated by using HSF (Human Splenic Fibroblasts) cell line DMEM medium containing 1% penicillin and streptomycin and 10% FBS by ATTC culture were maintained. The cells were incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C at 95% humidity and 5% carbon dioxide37. The cells were treated in 96-well platelets at concentrations of 0, 250, 500, 1000, and 1500\u00a0\u03bcg/ml peptide and incubated for another 72\u00a0h.

Cell viability was calculated using the following formula:\nAs adsorption of the sample, Ac adsorption of the control sample (DMEM medium, dye and cell) and A0 also adsorption of blank (dye alone)38.\nCalculation of therapeutic index. The ratio of MHC to the geometric mean (GM) of MIC against tested microbial strains was used for evaluating the therapeutic index of recombinant buforin I. To calculate the therapeutic index, the two-fold tested concentration (800\u00a0 g/mL) was employed when no hemolytic activity was detected at the highest concentration tested (400\u00a0g/mL)39.\nIn silico investigation of physical and chemical features peptide modeling. ProtParam (https:// web. expasy. org/ cgi- bin/ protp aram/ protp aram) was applied for predicting physical and chemical features inclouding amino acid composition, molecular weight, theoretical PI, instability index, aliphatic index, amino acid composition, and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) of peptides. Protein-Sol software was used for predicting proteins solubility11.\nPeptide modeling, in silico stability investigation and molecular electrostatic potentials. For in silico investigation of stability, the amino acid sequence of buforin I and recombinant buforin I, were modeled with I-TASSER server (https:// zhang group. org/ cgi- bin/ itass er) using default parameters40. The quality of the models was examined with VADAR server (http:// vadar. wisha rtlab. com/)41. For analysis of electrostatic potentials of predicted peptides, PyMol plug-in APBS tools were applied, and PDB2PQR and default grid set-tings were applied for the calculations31. The stability of peptides were analyzed using molecular dynamics simulation with the GROMACS 2016.1 package and GROMOS54a7 force field40 was solvated in a cubic box using the Simple Point Charge (SPC) water model, for neutralizing the overall charge of the systems, Na+ and Cl- ions were added as appropriate. The system was first energy minimized using the steepest descent algorithm to relax high-energy contacts. After energy minimization, the system was simulated under the NPT ensemble for 150\u00a0ns, with initial velocities taken from a Maxwell Boltzmann distribution corresponding to 100\u00a0K. During this initial simulation time, the peptide was positionally restrained at the temperature was 310\u00a0K at 1\u00a0atm. The dynamics and stability of peptides under, including root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuations (RMSF), and radius of gyration (RG) were analyzed during the simulation using GROMACS built-in tools40.\nIn vitro peptide stability investigation. The infrared spectra of individual His-tag buforin I and native buforin I peptides were obtained using a FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Nicolet, AVATAR 370) with an AquaSpec flow-through transmission cell and operating at 4\u00a0 cm-1 spectral resolution42. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were obtained using an X-ray diffractometer (Explorer, Italy) operating in reflection mode with CuKa (\u03bb = 1.54\u00a0A\u00b0) radiation at a scan rate of 0.02 to 2\u00a0 s\u22121. For both experiments the samples were prepared in DMSO (100\u00a0mM) and allowed to dry in a freeze dryer (Labconco, USA) before analysis16.\nStatistical analysis. In order to confirm the results, the experiments were repeated three times. Results of the study were analyzed by Minitab version 18.0 and differences among the means were determined by one-way ANOVA for significance at p < 0.05.\nEthical approval and informed consent. All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations by the clinical studies supervision organization of Iran. All experimental protocols were approved by Ethics Committee of the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects and/or their legal guardian(s)."
