"The goal of our work was to find the microscopic mechanism behind the dynamics of PCNB molecules in their plastic phase, as obtained by dielectric spectroscopy.14 We have performed this study by the concurrent use of single crystal X-ray synchrotron diffraction and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation."
