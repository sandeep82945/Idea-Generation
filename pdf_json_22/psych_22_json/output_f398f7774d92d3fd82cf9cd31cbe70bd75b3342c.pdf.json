    "abstractText": "(1) Owing to their resistance resources, nurses can reduce the effects of stress, increase their commitment to work and improve their functioning in the face of challenges in the workplace. The aim of this study was to determine the mediatory role of a general sense of coherence and a sense of comprehensibility, manageability and meaningfulness correlated with global self-esteem and the perceived stress intensity in a group of Polish nurses aged 45\u201355 years. (2) The research using the diagnostic survey method was conducted on a group of 176 nurses (M = 49.1; SD = 3.1) working in seven hospitals located in Olsztyn (Poland). The following were used for data collection: Perceived Stress Scale PSS-10, Rosenberg\u2019s Self-Esteem Scale and Antonovsky\u2019s Sense of Coherence (SOC-29) Questionnaire. (3) According to 21.02% of the nurses, their stress level at the workplace was low, 44.89% reported it was medium and 34.09% reported it was high. The self-esteem of nearly half of the nurses included in the study (48.30%) was at a medium level, 31.82% felt it was high and 19.89% felt it was low. The mediation analysis showed that a general sense of coherence and a sense of comprehensibility, manageability and meaningfulness have a mediator status in a correlation between global self-esteem and stress intensity. However, their mediatory role is partial. It is desirable for safe work environment promotion programmes to reinforce nurses\u2019 personal resources, which can be helpful in coping with stressors.",

            "text": "According to many studies, the contemporary work environment can be a source of stress and burden for nurses [1,2]. The level of stress perceived by nurses increase while the environmental stressors accumulate. An awareness of occupational stress and the experience of its adverse health consequences encourages prophylactic actions [1\u20133]. There are theoretical reasons and empirical evidence that an important role in the process of coping with adversities is played by one\u2019s personal resources, i.e., a set of relatively stable personal traits, cognitive factors and convictions, which affect the threat assessment and the coping processes [4]. One of such resources is self-esteem, also referred to as a sense of selfworth, which remains in a close relationship with the ability to predict the range of one\u2019s capabilities [5\u20137]. This is extremely important to nurses when they take actions, especially in new, unknown situations that are difficult to manage, because a nurse who starts a new activity should take into consideration her own capabilities. The coping effectiveness also depends on personal resources, referred to as \u2018a sense of coherence\u2019. According to Aron Antonovsky, this concept is founded on the assumption that there is a continuum of states between health and disease, which should be perceived as a whole, as a dynamic process of achieving a balance between requirements and resources in confrontation with stress [8]."

Research into stress increasingly often deals not\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 975. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19020975 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 975 2 of 15\nso much with the experience of stress itself, but with human activities aimed at managing the stressors, referred to as coping with stress [4,9]. The effects of stress are determined to a greater extent by coping with stress than with the objective properties of a stressor [4,9]. It is noteworthy that Steven Hobfoll\u2019s concept has been gaining importance in recent years. It is presented as a resource preservation model, according to which people strive to multiply their resources, understood as items valued by an individual, personal property, circumstances or factors [10]. A literature review confirmed a positive association between personal and professional resources and increased resistance to professional challenges [1,2,11,12]. Many authors included such constructs in a pool of personal and professional resources as: sense of self-efficiency, self-esteem, positive orientation, dispositional optimism, sense of coherence, manageability, social support, work satisfaction and general welfare [1,2,11,12]. According to a review by Yu et al., professional challenges (stress, professional burnout, post-traumatic stress disorder and harassment at work) are negatively correlated with a person\u2019s resistance [12]. Owing to growing resistance resources, nurses can reduce the effects of stress and emotional exhaustion, increase their commitment to work and improve their functioning in the face of challenges at the workplace [12]. In another study conducted by Martos Mart\u00ednez et al. among Spanish nurses, it was shown that effective coping with stress is affected by the subjective properties of an individual. Some individual variables, such as personality and an affective state can be regarded as stress moderators [13]. Psychological stress has been demonstrated to be associated with somatic health disorders [4]. According to the findings of many studies, mental well-being can be regarded as an indicator of an individual\u2019s adaptation to various critical or crisis events. This happens when the available resources are used in the optimum way to cope with a crisis situation [14,15]. It has been demonstrated in many studies that a shortage of nursing personnel results in work overload, thereby increasing the level of stress and professional burnout among nurses [12]. Measurement of subjectively perceived stress can be used as a good indicator of work overload, associated with the nursing profession [4]. Professional stress prophylaxis has gained special importance as a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a great impact on the physical and mental health of healthcare professionals, especially those working in direct contact with patients [16,17]. Many studies have been conducted to seek factors which help one to cope with such crises on an emotional level [18]."

            "text": "The definition of self-esteem by Morris Rosenberg is based on the assumption that people have different attitudes towards various objects, and one\u2019s own self is one of such objects [5]. One\u2019s self-image is associated with one\u2019s general well-being, emotions and attitude to tasks [6,7]. The study review shows that self-esteem can be approached in various ways and is sometimes interpreted as a sense of self-worth. According to several studies, people with high self-esteem experience more positive emotions and are more active, tenacious and healthier. On the other hand, people with low self-esteem experience more negative emotions and are less active, and they even show an attitude of avoidance in the face of difficulties, challenges and risk [7]. The first study conducted by Rosenberg showed that people with low self-esteem tend to be seen by nurses at a healthcare centre as more depressive and demonstrating sadness, desolation and disappointment [6,7]. Johnson et al. conducted a study among 306 healthcare professionals in Bangalore to answer the following question: does low self-esteem and a high level of stress lead to professional burnout among healthcare professionals? A path analysis showed that low self-esteem among healthcare professionals had a direct impact on experiencing professional burnout. The impact was also indirect, as employees with low self-esteem were nearly three times more susceptible to high stress levels [19]. The importance of a correlation between selfesteem and professional burnout among nurses was also confirmed in other studies [3,20]. Interesting findings of a study of nurses in Brazil were presented by Santos et al. They\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 975 3 of 15\nfound that such factors as smoking, religious beliefs, family income, length of time at work and special events during one\u2019s career could cause accidents and/or changes in employees\u2019 self-esteem, which could threaten their physical and mental health as well as their quality of life and work [21]. Radhakrishnan et al. conducted a study among healthcare professionals working in hospital \u201cfront line\u201d settings in India to understand their perceived stigmatising experiences and sense of self-worth during the COVID-19 pandemic [22]."

            "text": "Aaron Antonovsky, an eminent medical sociologist, claimed that a mental factor existed which had a positive impact on mechanisms of coping with stress and had a key role in processes of achieving, protecting and restoring good health. He called this factor \u2018a sense of coherence\u2019 (SOC) [8,23,24]. According to Antonovsky, SOC is a global, complex orientation of a person, showing the degree of conviction that the stimuli reaching the person\u2019s body from the inner and outer environment are structured, predictable and ones that can be explained; resources are available which allow for meeting the requirements set by these stimuli and it is worth the commitment and taking actions to meet the requirements [8]. SOC is regarded as a meta-resource, on which the utilisation of other resources largely depends. It comprises a sense of comprehensibility, manageability and meaningfulness that a person has [8,24]. The comprehensibility component concerns a cognitive aspect of the situation\u2014it is possible to work out and explain reality. The sense of manageability is referred to as an instrumental component\u2014an individual has a sense of having resources at their disposal to cope with requirements. Meaningfulness is the degree of feeling the sense of life. Being an emotional\u2013motivational component, it gives one a sense that it is worth engaging oneself in an action [8,23,24]. Antonovsky\u2019s theory of salutogenesis shows that human health can be affected by individual and work-related factors [8,23,24]. Masanotti et al. conducted a wide-ranging literature review and found SOC to be a predictor of depression, professional burnout and dissatisfaction with work among nurses [25\u201327]. The findings of a study conducted by Betke et al. confirmed that the sense of coherence promotes health in a stressful work environment \u2013 a high sense of coherence in nurses translates into better mental health, proper functioning in the work environment and following adaptative strategies of coping with stress [28]. Another study demonstrated a diversity in the three sense of coherence dimension levels among nurses in Sweden. The lowest level was observed in the manageability component, and the highest was in meaningfulness [29]. The aim of this study was to determine the mediatory role of a general sense of coherence and a sense of comprehensibility, manageability and meaningfulness in a correlation between global self-esteem and the perceived stress intensity in a group of Polish nurses aged 45\u201355 years."

Cohen, T. Kamarck, R. Mermelstein in a Polish adaptation by Z. Juczyn\u0301ski, N. Ogin\u0301ska-Bulik [4]; Self-Esteem Scale (SES) developed by M. Rosenberg, in a Polish adaptation by I. Dzwonkowska, K. Lachowicz-Tabaczek, M. \u0141aguna [6]; Sense of Coherence (SOC-29) Questionnaire by A. Antonovsky, in a Polish adaptation by J. Koniarek, B. Dudek, Z. Makowska [32]; The respondent group was characterised by the author\u2019s original questionnaire, which contained questions about the respondents\u2019 age, education, place of residence, marital status, financial situation, frequency of gynaecological check-ups and forms of physical exercise.\n2.2.1. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)\nThis scale is used to assess the intensity of stress associated with one\u2019s life situation over the past month. The stress intensity is determined not by a number of events but rather by their assessment. The scale contains ten questions about various subjective feelings related to personal problems and events, behaviours and methods of coping. For each question, it was a respondent\u2019s task to answer how often they thought and felt like that. Answers are provided a 5-point scale by assigning 0 to 4 points to each response, according to the following rules: 0 = never, 1 = hardly ever, 2 = sometimes, 3 = quite often, 4 = very often. The scores for answers to positive questions, i.e., 4, 5, 7, 8, were changed before the overall index of perceived stress was calculated, according to the rule: 0 = 4; 1 = 3; 3 = 1; 4 = 0. The overall score was the sum of all points, with a theoretical distribution from 0 to 40. A higher score reflected a higher perceived stress level. The internal reliability of the PSS-10 scale, evaluated on the basis of Cronbach alpha, is 0.86 [4].\n2.2.2. Rosenberg\u2019s Self-Esteem Scale (SES)\nRosenberg\u2019s Self-Esteem Scale is used for measuring the global explicit self-esteem, regarded as a relatively permanent attitude towards oneself. It is made up of ten diagnostic statements. A respondent was asked to indicate the extent to which he/she agreed with each of the statements by circling one answer. The answers are given on a 4-degree scale, from 1 to 4 (1\u2014I definitely agree, 4\u2014I definitely disagree). The respondent received from 1 to 4 points for each answer. With the adopted method of assessment, positive statements were reversed: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 so that a higher score was given for answers which expressed a higher self-esteem level. A respondent could receive a score of 10 to 40 points. A higher score reflected higher self-esteem. The SES scale has good psychometric properties. The questionnaire reliability, estimated with Cronbach\u2019s alpha for various standardisation groups, was satisfactory between 0.81 and 0.83 [6].\n2.2.3. Sense of Coherence (SOC-29) Questionnaire\nDeveloped by Aaron Antonovsky, the Sense of Coherence questionnaire comprises 29 test items, expressed as questions about various aspects of human life.

The points are subsequently summed up, and a higher score reflects a higher level of each component and a higher overall sense of coherence. The overall score in the SOC-29 questionnaire can range from 7 to 203 points. The SOC-29 questionnaire has good psychometric properties. In accordance with the theoretical assumptions, significant correlations were observed with various health parameters, and the high reliability of the questionnaire was demonstrated. The internal consistency indices calculated by the split-half method with the Spearman\u2013 Brown correction were: 0.92 for the overall sense of coherence, 0.78 for comprehensibility, 0.72 for manageability and 0.68 for meaningfulness [32]."

A score between 1 and 4 sten was regarded as low, whereas those from 7 to 10 sten were regarded as high, which corresponds to the area of approx. 33% of observations. A score of 5 and 6 sten was regarded as average [4,6]. The mediatory effects were measured by the methodology developed by R.M. Baron and D.A. Kenny [33]. The Sobel test was used to verify the statistical significance of the mediation analysis model [34].

A Correlation between the Global Self-Esteem and the Stress Intensity with a Mediator\u2014A Sense of Manageability\nThe mediatory role of a sense of manageability between global self-esteem and stress intensity was examined at a further stage. A positive correlation between global selfesteem and a sense of manageability was demonstrated in the first step: F(1, 174) = 42.55; p < 0.0001, \u03b2 = 0.443; p < 0.0001, and in the second step this was followed by a confirmation of a direct and negative correlation between global self-esteem and the stress intensity: F(1, 174) = 67.96; p < 0.0001, \u03b2 = \u22120.529; p < 0.0001. A variable described as a mediator\u2014a sense of manageability\u2014was introduced to the model in the next step. After a mediator\u2014a sense of manageability\u2014and an independent variable was taken into account in the analyses, the power of correlation between the global self-esteem and intensity of perceived stress decreased, but it remains statistically significant (\u03b2 = \u22120.356; p < 0.0001), whereas the mediator proved to be highly negatively correlated with the dependent variable: F(1, 174) = 74.95; p < 0.0001, \u03b2 = \u22120.549; p < 0.0001.

A Correlation between Global Self-Esteem and the Stress Intensity with a Mediator\u2014A Sense of Meaningfulness\nThe aim of the last mediation analysis was to determine whether a sense of meaningfulness plays a significant mediatory role between global self-esteem and the stress intensity in the nurses under study. The first step involved testing a correlation between global self-esteem and a sense of meaningfulness, which is positive and statistically significant: F(1, 174) = 55.05; p < 0.0001, \u03b2 = \u22120.490; p < 0.0001. A direct negative correlation between global self-esteem and the stress intensity was confirmed in the second step: F(1, 174) = 67.96; p < 0.0001, \u03b2 = \u22120.529; p < 0.0001. A mediator\u2014a sense of meaningfulness\u2014was introduced to the model in the third step, and the significance of the mediation model was evaluated. The power of correlation between an independent variable and a dependent variable after a mediator\u2014a sense of meaningfulness\u2014was introduced decreased slightly, but it is still statistically significant (\u03b2 = \u22120.443; p < 0.0001), and the mediator proved to be significantly correlated to the dependent variable: F(1, 174) = 31.82; p < 0.0001, \u03b2 = \u22120.393; p < 0.0001. One can conclude that a sense of meaningfulness is a partial mediator of a correlation between global self-esteem and stress intensity. The mediation in the model under discussion was confirmed by the Sobel test result (z = 4.26; p < 0.0002) (Figure

            "text": "The mean stress intensity score on the PSS-10 scale in this study was 17.40 (SD = 5.3), and it was slightly higher than in the normalisation study in a group of healthy subjects [4]. A comparison of the score between this study and the results for nursing students in an international study showed that the mean stress intensity levels for the nursing students were higher in the group in Poland, in Spain and in Slovakia than in th group f nurses aged 45\u201355 years in this study [36]. It is also noteworthy that a Polish normalisation study revealed statistically significant differences in the stress intensity in clinical groups. Relatively low stress levels were noted in patients on dialysis. The mean perceived stress level on the PSS-10 scale in this group was 16.87 (SD = 5.55), and it was lower than in the group of nurses in this study. A high perceived stress intensity was observ d in postmenopausal women and in people after a cardiac infarction, which is a clear indication that they should be provided with special psychological care [4]. The data from the current study showed that 34.09% of the nurses experienced high levels of stress during the past month associated with their own life situation, which may indicate that they are excessively loaded with their work as nurses. Other studies show that high stress levels in nursing students cause a decrease in the q ality of their lives [36]. Zheng et al. argue that nurses\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 975 11 of 15\nare exposed to more serious effects of stress, including health-related effects, during the COVID-19 pandemic [37]. Mazza et al., who conducted a study in Italy, confirmed that the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, associated, for example, with the quarantine, bring about an increased level of stress, anxiety and depression in the general population [38]. Global self-esteem, manifesting itself in how one thinks about oneself, is another variable under analysis. The current study revealed the mean global self-esteem score for the whole group to be 30.9 points and was comparable with the mean calculated from the data collected in 53 countries (M = 30.85) [39]. The study results show that the self-esteem of nearly half of the nurses included in the study, aged 45\u201355 years (48.30%), was at an average level, 31.82% reported a high level, and 19.89% reported a low level. A different study in Poland produced similar findings [3]. An analysis of the correlations of global self-esteem with different variables should address a relatively new trend in research of a sympathetic attitude towards oneself, proposed by Kristin Neff, who understands it as \u201cbeing open and sensitive to one\u2019s suffering, while experiencing care and kindliness towards oneself, adopting an understanding and non-judging attitude towards one\u2019s flaws and failures, realising that one\u2019s own experience is part of the common experience of mankind\u201d [40]. The findings of a study conducted by Dzwonkowska showed that people who are more sympathetic towards themselves, with higher self-esteem, are less susceptible to depression and they feel fewer negative emotions and are less lonely, and at the same time experience more positive affective states than those less sympathetic and with lower self-esteem [41]. The feeling of self-worth is an important source of coping with stress and health protection, and it is associated with work satisfaction. Studies of the correlations between the stress intensity and the coping strategies followed by nurses confirm a correlation between these two variables. Duran et al. conducted a study among a group of 121 nurses in Turkey who worked at intensive care units and showed that those with high self-esteem have fewer psychological issues than those with low self-esteem [42]. In their study, Dimunov\u00e1 et al. found the choice of a coping strategy by nurses working in anaesthesiology and intensive care departments in Slovakia to be correlated with self-esteem. Nurses with high self-esteem levels preferred adaptive coping strategies, such as active coping, positive redefinition, planning and acceptance. On the other hand, nurses with average and low global selfesteem scores preferred non-adaptive coping strategies: denial, lack of commitment and blaming themselves [43]. Performing the nursing profession entails frequent difficult (often stressful) situations as a consequence of being responsible for the highest values\u2014human health and life. According to many researchers, a sense of coherence can considerably contribute to maintaining good health, modify one\u2019s functioning in a stressful work environment, protect nurses from professional burnout and affect the choice of a strategy for coping with stress [23,25,28]. The analyses performed in the current study show that the mean score for the overall sense of coherence for nurses aged 45\u201355 years was 130.5 (SD = 19.8) points, for comprehensibility\u201447.0 (SD = 10.6), for manageability\u201447.5 (SD = 7.8) and for meaningfulness\u201436.0 (SD = 5.5). These findings do not differ significantly from other studies conducted among Polish nurses [44]. Kocie\u0328cka et al. found nurses with high SOC scores to exhibit fewer somatic disorders, anxiety, sleep disorders and to be less prone to depression [45]. Similarly, a study conducted by Malagon-Aguilera among a group of 109 nurses working in a long-term medical care facility found that nurses with a higher sense of coherence were healthier and more committed to their work [46]. Ando et al. conducted a study of a group of 130 psychiatric nurses in a hospital in Japan and found that the sense of coherence affected their work satisfaction and was negatively correlated with unethical behaviour [47]. A study conducted by Jaz\u0307dz\u0307ewska et al. showed an increase in the hope for success was accompanied by an increase in the sense of coherence in the nurses [48]. A different study of a group of women with breast cancer being treated with chemotherapy showed women with a high sense of coherence reported lower fatigue, lower incidence of adverse effects of chemotherapy, and they enjoyed a better quality of life [49]. Zamanian et al. conducted a study of a group of 221 women with breast cancer\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 975 12 of 15\nand observed a positive correlation between the sense of coherence and quality of life. They concluded that practical activities aimed at reinforcing the sense of coherence in women should be included in rehabilitation programmes [50]. According to ColomerP\u00e9rez et al., reinforcing the sense of coherence in nurse assistants through a salutogenic education strategy increases their health resources and contributes to higher resistance to work-related stress [51]. The findings of a study by Allan et al. showed that the level of perceived stress at work had a significant, negative correlation with a sense of life. Understanding the importance of one\u2019s personal development at work improves the protection against the negative impact of occupational stress [52]. Occupational stress is an inevitable, sometimes essential, element of the work environment, but it does not have to result in an organisational, psychological, behavioural or medical dysfunction [53]. In conclusion, it should be noted that global self-esteem and a sense of coherence as subjective individual properties make nurses\u2014even if they perceive some events as stressors\u2014cope with them better and will not experience negative effects of the stress transaction (or will experience them as weaker).\nLimitations and Implications for Professional Practice\nIt has been demonstrated in this study that global self-esteem is a predictor for a sense of coherence and a sense of comprehensibility, manageability and meaningfulness. The analysis has shown that the higher the self-esteem level, the higher the conviction of a sense of coherence. A significant negative correlation has also been found between global self-esteem and stress intensity. Moreover, it has been confirmed that a general sense of coherence and its components have a mediator status in a correlation between global self-esteem and the stress intensity in the group of nurses aged 45\u201355 years. It has been revealed that the components of a sense of coherence constitute the essential cognitive and emotional\u2013motivational resources which determine one\u2019s capability for coping with stress. At the same time, they do not complete the research of the correlations discussed here. The study author indicated certain limitations, as the study group comprised nurses of only one age group. It would also be worthwhile to perform analyses taking into consideration gender as a variable. The findings may be useful in adapting psychological interventions oriented towards styles and strategies of coping with stress by nurses in their work environments and in private lives. There are also reasons to develop and perfect the nurses\u2019 abilities to build a positive self-attitude, and a sense of comprehensibility, manageability and meaningfulness."

The results for the overall sense of coherence and its components: comprehensibil-\nity, manageability and meaningfulness, do not differ much from those in other studies conducted among Polish nurses. It has been shown in the adopted mediation model that a general sense of coherence and a sense of comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness have a mediator status in a correlation between global self-esteem and stress intensity. However, their mediatory role is partial in the correlation between the variables. It is desirable for safe work environment promotion programmes to reinforce nurses\u2019 personal resources, which can be helpful in coping with stressors.\nFunding: This work was a part of a research project, financed by the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn (No. 63-610-001), Poland.\nInt.
