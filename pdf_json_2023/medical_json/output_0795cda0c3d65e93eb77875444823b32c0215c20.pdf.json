A deep understanding of the heterogeneity and intercellular communication network in the TME of HCC will provide promising strategies to orchestrate the immune system to target and eradicate cancers.\nMethods: Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and computational analysis of 35786 unselected single cells from 3 human HCC tumour and 3 matched adjacent samples to elucidate the heterogeneity and intercellular communication network of the TME. The specific lysis of HCC cell lines was examined in vitro using cytotoxicity assays. Granzyme B concentration in supernatants of cytotoxicity assays was measured by ELISA.\nResults: We found that VCAN+ tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) might undergo M2-like polarization and differentiate in the tumour region. Regulatory dendritic cells (DCs) exhibited immune regulatory and tolerogenic phenotypes in the TME. Furthermore, we observed intensive potential intercellular crosstalk among C1QC+ TAMs, regulatory DCs, regulator T (Treg) cells, and exhausted CD8+ T cells that fostered an immunosuppressive niche in the HCC TME. Moreover, we identified that the TIGIT-PVR/PVRL2 axis provides a prominent coinhibitory signal in the immunosuppressive TME. In vitro, antibody blockade of PVR or PVRL2 on HCC cell lines or TIGIT blockade on immune cells increased immune cell-mediated lysis of tumour cell. This enhanced immune response is paralleled by the increased secretion of Granzyme B by immune cells.\nfrontiersin.org01\nFrontiers in Immunology\nDiscussion: Collectively, our study revealed the functional state, clinical significance, and intercellular communication of immunosuppressive cells in HCC at single-cell resolution. Moreover, PVR/PVRL2, interact with TIGIT act as prominent coinhibitory signals and might represent a promising, efficacious immunotherapy strategy in HCC.\nKEYWORDS\nsingle-cell RNA sequencing, HCC, TME, immunotherapy, PVR/PVRL2"

            "text": "Liver cancer is one of most prevalent malignancies in the world, with an estimated 905,677 new cases and 830,180 deaths occurring per year (1). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for approximately 90% of liver cancers and has been closely related to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in China (1, 2). Due to poor liver function or distant metastasis, over 80% of HCC patients fail to meet surgical resection criteria (3). Three types of FDA-approved drugs, that is, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (sorafenib, regorafenib, cabozantinib, and lenvatinib), immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) (nivolumab and pembrolizumab), and vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (bevacizumab) have been used for advanced HCC (4). However, the overall 5-year survival rate of HCC is still poor (5). As such, understanding relevant mechanisms and designing new treatment strategies for HCC have remained challenging tasks.\nThe tumor microenvironment (TME) has been a popular area for drug discovery (6). Unlike tumor cells, immune cells within the TME are genetically stable and thus are popular therapeutic targets with a reduced risk of resistance and tumor recurrence (7\u20139). These immune cells within TME are highly heterogeneous, with tumorantagonizing or tumor-promoting functions (10). In the early stage of tumorigenesis, the tumor-antagonizing immune cells tend to target and kill the cancer cells. However, the cancer cells can eventually escape from immune surveillance and even suppress the cytotoxic function of tumor-antagonizing immune cells. Thus, a deep understanding of the immune cells in TME based on singlecell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) will provide promising strategies to target and eradicate cancers. Two recent studies demonstrated that T cells and immune cells exhibit various states in HCC using single-cell transcriptome analysis (11, 12). Given the limitations of functional analysis of immunosuppressive cells and intercellular crosstalk in the TME at the single-cell level, we performed scRNAseq to better elucidate the mechanisms of HCC progression and with an aim to modulate the immune system to target and eradicate cancers.\nIn the current study, we profiled the transcriptome of 35786 single cells from HCC patients and matching nonmalignant tissue, and we provide a comprehensive global view of the multifaceted immunosuppressive landscape and their interactome in HCC TME that foster an immunosuppressive niche. More importantly, the\n02\nTIGIT-PVR/PVRL2 axis was found to provide a prominent coinhibitory signal in the immunosuppressive TME. We show that blocking the TIGIT-PVR/PVRL2 axis enhanced immune cell-mediated lysis of HCC cells."

The human HCC tumor and adjacent samples were obtained immediately after surgical resection at the First Hospital of Jilin University. The study design was in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Human Ethics Committee of the First Hospital of Jilin University (21K089-001). Informed consent was obtained from all participants.\nTissue dissociation and single-cell suspension preparation\nFresh tumor and adjacent normal tissue were processed immediately with mechanical dissociation and enzymatic digestion to generate single-cell suspensions. Briefly, each sample was cut into approximately 1-mm3 pieces in culture medium (DMEM; Gibco) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco) and then incubated with type II (Thermo Fisher) and IV (Thermo Fisher) enzyme solution for 30 min on a 37\u00b0C shaker.

Briefly, the sorted cells were washed twice with sorting buffer. Then, a trypan blue (Thermo Fisher) staining exclusion assay was used to determine the cell viability and cell number. The singlecell suspension was further mixed with barcoded gel beads on a Chromium Controller (10x Genomics) to produce gel beads in emulsion (GEMs). To capture a target of 8000 cells per library, approximately 12,000 cells were loaded in each channel. After construction of GEMs, reverse transcription reactions were conducted to generate barcoded full-length cDNA, and amplification for 14 cycles was conducted on a thermal cycler (Bio\u2013Rad). According to the instructions, cDNA sequencing libraries were constructed. The Qsep100 (Bioptic) analyzer was used to quantitate the average fragment size of a library. Every library was sequenced on a HiSeq X system (Illumina), and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated.\nRaw data processing and identification of cell types\nBcl2fastq (version v2.19.0.316, Illumina) was used to convert raw data from binary base call (BCL) format to FASTQ files. Sequencing reads in the FASTQ files were aligned to reference genomes of interest by using Cell Ranger pipelines (version 3.0.1; 10x Genomics) to subsequently generate feature-barcode matrices. Single-cell 5\u2019-gene expression data were processed using Cell Ranger Count implemented in the pipelines. The gene expression data were mapped to the human genome reference sequence (GRCh38; http://cf.10Xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/refdatacel lranger-GRCh38-1.2.0.tar .gz). Then, the R package \u201cDoubletFinder\u201d (https://github.com/chris-mcginnisucsf/ DoubletFinder) was applied to remove doublets in each sample individually. The filtered remaining cells were single cells. Next, the gene expression matrices of all remaining tumor and adjacent normal tissue cells were combined and converted into a Seurat object by using the R package Seurat (version 2.3.4, https:// satijalab.org/seurat). Cells with less than 1001 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), less than 501 genes, or over 10% mitochondrialderived UMI counts were considered low-quality cells and were removed. Ultimately, 35786 single cells remained, and they were used for subsequent analyses. From the remaining cells, gene expression matrices were log normalized and subjected to linear regression by using the R Seurat package.\nSince samples from the patients were processed independently and sequenced in batches, we used canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and the RunUMAP function implemented in Seurat to reduce the dimensionality of the scRNA-seq dataset and remove potential batch effects. The main cell clusters were identified with the FindClusters function in Seurat, with the resolution set as 0.5. Then, cell clusters were visualized with 2D UMAP plots. The average gene expression of conventional markers, described in a\nFrontiers in Immunology 03\nprevious study was used to annotate the clusters as major biological cell types. First, 35786 cells were clustered into six major cell types. Subsequently, the abovementioned normalization, dimensionality reduction, and clustering processes were repeated, and the major cell types were further clustered into subclusters of different specific cell subtypes. The Seurat FindAllmarkers function was employed to identify preferentially expressed genes in each subcluster compared with the other subclusters.\nPathway analysis and definition of signature scores\nPathway activities score of per cell implemented in the GSVA package (13) was used for enrichment analysis. Then, the differences in pathway activities scored per cell between C1QC+ TAMs and VCAN+ TAMs were calculated by two-sided unpaired limma-moderated t test. For three subclusters of DC cells (Regulatory DCs, cDC1s, and cDC2s), the differences in pathway activities scored per cell between regulatory DCs VS cDC1s & cDC2s; cDC1s VS regulatory DCs & cDC2s; cDC2s VS regulatory DCs & cDC1s were calculated by two-sided unpaired limmamoderated t test respectively. Then, the p value is adjusted by Benjamini-Hochberg method.\nTo calculate the M1/M2 score of TAMs and the antigen processing and presentation and immune regulatory scores of DCs, GSVA was conducted. Gene sets associated with the above functions were retrieved from previous studies (14, 15)."

Correlations between specific cell types were estimated by Spearman correlation methods.\nThe relative abundances of cell types identified in this study were evaluated by CibersortX (16). Subsequently, all the TCGA LIHC patients were divided into high and low groups based on the optimal cutoff point, which was determined by the \u201csurvminer\u201d R package. The prognostic significance of the relative abundance of cell types between the high and low groups was calculated by Kaplan\u2013Meier curves. Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed that the relative abundance was an independent prognostic factor."

The cells were further annotated as specific cell type subpopulations according to the expression of classic markers, including T cells (CD3D+), myeloid cells (CD68+), endothelial cells (CD34+), hepatocytes (ALB+), B cells (CD79A+), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) (ACTA2+) (Figure 1B; Supplementary Figure 1E, F).\nfrontiersin.org\nVCAN+ TAMs undergo M2-like polarization in the tumor region\nConsidering the immunosuppressive state of myeloid cells in tumor samples, the intrinsic functional subsets of the myeloid cells were further explored. Reclustering of the 5506 myeloid cells produced four clusters (Figure 2A). In contrast to the complex phenotypes of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the breast cancer and lung cancer TMEs (14, 22), the TAMs in HCC exhibited remarkable dichotomy (VCAN+ TAMs and C1QC+ TAMs) (Figure 2A). The coexistence of \u2018\u2018classically activated\u2019\u2019 (M1) and \u2018\u2018alternatively activated\u2019\u2019 (M2) macrophage signatures (23) in the VCAN+ TAMs and C1QC+ TAMs demonstrated the limitations of the M1 and M2 polarization model in vitro (Supplementary Figures 2A, B). Specifically, VCAN+ TAMs highly expressed myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC)-associated genes, S100A family genes, VCAN, and FCN1 (Figure 2C) (24). In contrast, C1QC+ TAMs expressed the classical TAM-associated genes C1QA, C1QB, C1QC, APOE, and TREM2, which were previously reported in lung cancer (Figure 2C) (23). Notably, C1QC+ TAMs were specifically distributed in tumor tissue (Figure 2A). Moreover, the transcriptomes of the VCAN+ TAMs and C1QC+ TAMs showed gradual differences (Figure 2C), suggesting that VCAN+ TAMs were reprogrammed into C1QC+ TAMs in the tumor\nFrontiers in Immunology 05\nregion. Following pseudotime trajectory analysis using Monocle2 to explore the potential transition between VCAN+ TAMs and C1QC+ TAMs, we observed that VCAN+ TAMs developed into C1QC+ TAMs with higher pseudotime scores, meaning that the C1QC+ TAMs were more mature and differentiated TAMs (Figure 2B), which confirmed that VCAN+ TAMs were reprogrammed into C1QC+ TAMs.\nPseudotime analysis was then conducted to investigate the dynamic changes in M1 and M2 scores in TAMs. The M2 score significantly increased with increasing pseudotime (Figure 2D). In this differentiation process, the coinhibitors HAVCR2, LAIR1, LGALS9, and CD276 were all upregulated, while the coactivators TNFSF14, CD48, and CD44 were downregulated (Figure 2E). These results suggested that VCAN+ TAMs undergo M2-like polarization in the tumor region and further exert immunosuppressive functions. Pathway activity in both TAM populations was analyzed by gene set variation analysis (GSVA), revealing strong enrichment of tumor vasculature, tumor angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix (ECM) regulator pathways in C1QC+ TAMs, while complement activation and cytokine pathways were significantly enriched in VCAN+ TAMs (Supplementary Figure 3A). Strikingly, the TGFB1 signaling, WNT signaling, and liver cancer metastasis pathways were specifically enriched in C1QC+ TAMs, suggesting that the cells play a protumorigenic\nA\nB\nfrontiersin.org\nand prometastatic role in HCC (Supplementary Figure 3A). The utility of the cell types identified in this study was evaluated with CIBERSORTx in samples from the TCGA LIHC cohort (16). Strikingly, only the accumulation of C1QC+ TAMs was related to poorer overall survival (OS) (Figures 2F, G). We also observed that the C1QC+ TAMs were independent of other clinical features, including age, sex, grade, and TNM stage, via multivariate Cox\nFrontiers in Immunology 06\nanalyses, suggesting their independent prognostic value (Figure 2H). Through SCENIC analysis, we found that the activity of FOSL2 was downregulated, while activation of MAF motifs was responsible for the M2 polarization, in line with the gene expression patterns (Figure 2I; Supplementary Figure 3B). These results provide potential therapeutic targets for reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment.\nA B\nD\nE\nF\nG\nI\nH\nC\nFIGURE 2 The TAMs in HCC exhibited a remarkable dichotomy.

Subcluster 3 highly expressed LILRA4, GZMB, and IL3RA, representing pDCs. Subcluster 2 highly expressed CLEC9A, CADM1, and XCR1, corresponding to cDC1s. Subcluster 0 highly expressed CD1C, FCER1A, and CLEC10A, representing cDC2s (Supplementary Figure 4A). Notably, subcluster 1 highly expressed the maturation markers LAMP3, MARCKSL1, IDO1, and UBD; activation markers\nfrontiersin.org\nCD80, CD83, and CD40; migration markers CCR7, FSCN1, and SLCO5A1; and immune-suppressive markers CD274, PDCD1LG2, CD200, EBI3, IDO1, IL4I1, SOCS1, and SOCS2 (Figure 3B), indicating that this subcluster closely resembled the \u2018\u2018mregDCs\u2019\u2019 described by Maier (25). Regulatory DCs were significantly distributed in tumor tissues (Supplementary Figure 4B). It has been shown that cDCs can be educated towards a regulatory DC phenotype with immune suppressive functions by the TME (26). Analysis of signaling pathways by GSVA revealed that the term \u2018activation of immune response\u2019 was downregulated in regulatory DCs, which was consistent with this cluster showing upregulated expression of a subset of immune-suppressive genes and the highest immune regulatory score (Figures 3B\u2013D). In addition, cytokine \u2212cytokine receptor interactions were upregulated in regulatory DCs (Figure 3C). We found that these cells expressed various cytokines, including CCL17, CCL19, and CCL22 (Figure 3B). Previous studies have demonstrated that CCL19 has a strong ability to recruit regulatory T (Treg) cells through binding to CXCR3 (27). Moreover, the regulatory DC signature was positively correlated with the Treg cell signature in the TCGA LIHC cohort (Figure 4D). All these results suggested that regulatory DCs could directly inhibit CD8+ T cells through immunosuppressive molecules or indirectly inhibit CD8+ T cells by recruiting Treg cells into the tumor region.\nTo characterize the developmental origins of regulatory DCs, we applied the Monocle2 algorithm and observed that regulatory DCs might develop from cDC1s or cDC2s (Supplementary Figure 4C). Combined with their antigen presentation and immune regulatory scores (Figure 3D), these data suggested that cDCs might be converted into regulatory DCs with decreased antigen-presenting capacity and increased immune-suppressive ability in the tumor region."

Given antitumor capabilities of CD8+ T cells, we performed pseudotime trajectory analysis to reveal the underlying evolution of these cells. Interestingly, we observed a gradual transition of CD8+ T cells towards an exhausted status (Supplementary Figure 5B). Exhausted CD8+ T cells in cell cluster 4 showed upregulated LAG3, PDCD1 (PD-1) and TIGIT (Supplementary Figure 5C). To explore the cellular communication network in HCC, we examined potential ligand\u2212receptor binding pairs among different cell clusters derived from HCC tumors using CellPhoneDB software. We observed intensive cellular coinhibitory, costimulatory, chemokine and adhesion interactions among C1QC+ TAMs, regulatory DCs, Treg cell, and exhausted CD8+ T cells (CD8+ Tex_C3) that fostered an immunosuppressive niche (Figures 4A, B). Regulatory DCs had high expression of CD80/CD86, ADORA2A, and CD70, which showed ligand\u2013receptor binding to CTLA4/CD28, ENTPD1, and CD27 on Treg cells, respectively, suggesting a potential interaction between regulatory DCs and Treg cells (Figure 4A). Regulatory DCs were also predicted to interact with Treg cells\nFrontiers in Immunology 08\nthrough CCL19-CXCR3 and CXCL10-CXCR3, which are known for recruiting Treg cells into tumor tissue (Figure 4A) (27).

C1QC+ TAMs were also predicted to interact with exhausted CD8+ T cells through adhesion molecules (ICAM1ITGAL and ICAM1-AREG) and immune molecules (HAVCR2LGALS9) (Figure 4B), which are well-known to promote CD8+ T cell exhaustion in the TME (29). Consistently, we observed significant correlations of gene signatures among regulatory DCs, Treg cells, exhausted CD8+ T cells, and C1QC+ TAMs in an independent TCGA LIHC cohort (n = 369) (Figures 4C\u2013H). We explored the potential cellular communication network between immune-suppressive niche cells (regulatory DCs, Treg cells, exhausted CD8+ T cells, and C1QC+ TAMs) and malignant cells. TIGIT-PVR/PVRL2 interactions were observed between HCC cells and Treg cells or exhausted CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Figure 6A). These findings suggest that intensive cellular crosstalk among immune-suppressive cell types plays a vital role in maintaining TME homoeostasis in HCC.\nThe TIGIT-PVR/PVRL2 axis is a potential immunotherapeutic target in HCC patients\nICIs have reshaped cancer therapy. However, their efficacy and objective response rates are still unsatisfactory, indicating that our insufficient understanding of the immune microenvironment in HCC hinders effective drug development. We thus conducted systemic immune checkpoint analysis with both tumourinfiltrating immune cells (CD4 T, CD8 T, Treg, and natural killer (NK) cells) and complementary antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (macrophages, DCs, and tumour cells). The relative contribution of coinhibitory and costimulatory checkpoints in shaping the immunosuppressive landscape of HCC was estimated. We identified that the TIGIT\u2013PVR/PVRL2 axis provides a prominent coinhibitory signal in tumour-infiltrating immune cells and APCs. The classical immune-suppressive CTLA4-CD80/CD86 and PD-1 (PDCD1)-PD-L1/L2 (CD274/PDCD1LG2) pathways showed minimal involvement (Figure 5A; Supplementary Figure 6B). In addition, further investigation using the TCGA LIHC cohort showed that high expression of PVR and PVRL2 was significantly associated with poorer OS of HCC patients (Figure 5B). Furthermore, in the TCGA cohorts, PVR and PVRL2 were significantly upregulated in HCC tumour compared to non tumour l iver samples (Figure 5C) . Moreover , us ing immunohistochemistry (IHC) data from the Human Protein Atlas database, we demonstrated significant upregulation of PVR and PVRL2 in HCC tumour compared to normal liver samples (Figures 5D, E). These findings suggest that overexpression of PVR/ PVRL2 might be important in generating an immunosuppressive landscape during HCC development.\nWe continued to investigate the therapeutic potential of blocking novel immune checkpoint molecules PVR and PVRL2 for hepatocellular carcinoma through in vitro immune cell mediated cytotoxicity assays.

We found that the enhanced cytotoxicity is eliminated (Figure 6E). The enhanced immune response was paralleled by the increased secretion of Granzyme B by immune cells in the cellular supernatant (Figures 7A\u2013D).

            "text": "HCC is a lethal malignancy, with more than 80% of patients being diagnosed at an advanced stage (3). Multiple TKIs (sorafenib, regorafenib, cabozantinib, and lenvatinib), ICIs (nivolumab and pembrolizumab), and vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (bevacizumab) have been used to systemically treat advanced HCC. Nevertheless, their efficacy is still unsatisfactory, and objective response rates are at most 25% (30). New therapy targets and/or combined therapy strategies are urgently needed, and such discoveries can be accelerated by a better understanding of the TME. Zhang et al. revealed the immune cells in the HCC TME have dynamic properties (12). Lu et al. further generated a landscape of the global cellular microenvironment of primary and metastatic HCCs (31). However,\nFrontiers in Immunology 10\nthe analysis of functional state, clinical significance, and intercellular communication of immunosuppressive cells in the TME are still lacking. Additionally, the prominent coinhibitory signal in the immunosuppressive TME of HCC needs to be comprehensively evaluated. Herein, we generated a single-cell transcriptome atlas and revealed the functional state and clinical significance of immunesuppressive cell types. Moreover, we visualized the complex interaction network in the TME of HCC at single-cell resolution. Our present study provides strong evidence that the TIGIT-PVR/ PVRL2 axis may represent a promising therapeutic target for HCC patients.\nIn contrast to the dynamic spectrum of TAM phenotypes in lung and breast cancer (14, 22), we identified that TAMs in HCC consisted of VCAN+ and C1QC+ TAMs, exhibiting remarkable dichotomy. Neither of the two clusters exactly matched the M1 or M2 phenotype, consistent with previous studies (14, 32). Rather, C1QC+ TAMs showed enrichment of tumor vasculature, tumor angiogenesis, and ECM regulator pathways, while complement activation and cytokine pathways were significantly enriched in VCAN+ TAMs. Notably, VCAN+ TAMs were reprogrammed into C1QC+ TAMs with upregulated coinhibitor and downregulated coactivator expression in the tumor region, suggesting key roles of C1QC+ TAMs in the tumorigenesis of HCC. Recently, depleting TAMs to promote antitumor immune responses has been revealed as a novel therapeutic approach. However, limited therapeutic benefit was observed in cancer patients treated with monotherapy, although TAMs were significantly depleted by CSF1R blockade (33). The\nA B\nD EC\nFIGURE 6 Blocking of the TIGIT-PVR/PVRL2 axis increases the lysis of HCC cell lines.

In line with this, only the accumulation of C1QC+ TAMs was related to poorer OS. Our data suggest that specific depletion of C1QC+ TAMs could improve myeloid-targeted immunotherapy. As reported previously, tumor-associated myeloid cells are heterogeneous (14). We found that regulatory DCs exhibited immune regulatory and tolerogenic phenotypes with upregulated maturation, migration, and activation markers in line with those reported for regulatory DCs in multiple cancers recently (25, 35). Moreover, the regulatory DCs highly expressed the immune suppression-related genes CD274, PDCD1LG2, CD200, EBI3, IDO1, IL4I1, SOCS1, and SOCS2, showing a similar expression pattern to LAMP3+ DCs in lung cancer (25). We also observed that the regulatory DCs had a decreased antigen-presenting capacity and increased immune-suppressive ability in the tumor region. These results suggested that specifically depleting regulatory DCs or modulating these cells towards a normal phenotype may also be attractive therapeutic approaches for HCC.\nWe observed intensive cellular coinhibitory, costimulatory, chemokine and/or adhesion interactions among C1QC+ TAMs, regulatory DCs, Treg cells, and exhausted CD8+ T cells in HCC, suggesting that multiple immune suppressive cells foster an immunosuppressive niche in the TME of HCC. Indeed, regulatory DCs have a strong ability to recruit Treg cells through the interactions between CCL19-CXCR3 and CXCL10-CXCR3,\nFrontiers in Immunology 11\nwhich has also been demonstrated in colorectal cancers (27). In addition, regulatory DCs also highly express IDO1 in HCC, which can induce tumor-infiltrating Treg cell proliferation (36). On the other hand, Treg cells and regulatory DCs showed ligand\u2013receptor binding through CTLA4-CD80/CD86, which regulate the maturation of tolerogenic DCs, consistent with studies in other cancers (37). The interactions between regulatory DCs and Treg cells could enhance the immune-suppressive effects of exhausted CD8+ T cells in HCC. Additionally, potential ligand\u2013receptor interactions were observed between C1QC+ TAMs and Treg cells, including those of chemokines (CCL18-CCR8), which are well known to promote the immune-suppressive activity of Treg cells in the TME (28). C1QC+ TAMs interact with exhausted CD8+ T cells through immune regulation (HAVCR2-LGALS9) to promote CD8+ T cell exhaustion (29). These findings suggest that intensive cellular crosstalk among immune-suppressive cell types plays a vital role in maintaining TME homoeostasis in HCC. Thus, we propose that disrupting these intensive interactions could disrupt the balance of the TME and thus cure HCC.\nThe intratumor and intertumor heterogeneity of the malignant cells in HCC renders conventional chemotherapy or TKIs, which generally operate in a one-size-fits-all manner, ineffective in HCC. In this sense, immunotherapy, such as ICI therapy, instead of targeting certain specific tumor subclones is a more rational treatment option for advanced HCC patients. Furthermore, the\nA B\nDC\nFIGURE 7 Blocking of the TIGIT-PVR/PVRL2 axis results in increased levels of Granzyme B secretion of immune cells.

As the classical immune-suppressive CTLA4-CD80/ CD86 and PD-1 (PDCD1)-PD-L1/L2 (CD274/PDCD1LG2) pathways were found to be minimally involved, they may have uncertain functions in treatment-na\u00efve HCC patients. These findings could partially explain the unsatisfactory efficacy of antiPD-1 antibodies and anti-CTLA4 antibodies in HCC treatment (38\u201340). Immune checkpoint therapeutic targets need to be further explored. Our findings suggested that the prominent coinhibitory signal of the TIGIT-PVR/PVRL2 axis is involved in HCC. Indeed, Zhang et al. mentioned potential interaction of LAMP3+ DCs and NK cells via TIGIT in the HCC TME (12). Ostroumov et al. reported that the expression of TIGIT is more reliable in identifying CD8+ T cell exhaustion than PD-1 (41). In addition, further investigation using the TCGA LIHC cohort in this study showed that high expression of PVR and PVRL2 was significantly associated with poorer OS of HCC patients. In vitro, antibody blockade of PVR or PVRL2 on HCC cell lines or TIGIT blockade on immune cells increased immune cell-mediated lysis of tumor cell. This enhanced immune response is paralleled by the increased secretion of Granzyme B by immune cells. These results demonstrated that the TIGIT-PVR/PVRL2 axis is a major coinhibitory immune checkpoint in human HCC. Hauke et al. demonstrated that PVR and PVRL2 act as prognostic markers and represent new therapeutic targets in acute myeloid leukemia in vitro (42). Additionally, ongoing clinical trials of anti-TIGIT antibodies in non-small-cell lung cancer (phase II CITYSCAPE trial) have shown encouraging treatment outcomes. It is highly anticipated that targeting the TIGIT-PVR/PVRL2 axis alone or in combination with other drugs may offer hope to HCC patients.\nOur study had several limitations. First, cytotoxicity assays were performed by using HCC cell lines and healthy donor-derived immune cells. This approach differs from the TME in vivo. Blockade TIGIT-PVR/PVRL2 axis in an autologous setting using primary HCC cancer cells and the corresponding tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes should be further studied. Second, due to the limitations of the deconvolution algorithm, identifying the accurate proportion of VCAN+ TAMs and C1QC+ TAMs from bulk sequencing data is difficult. Last, batch effects, the main problems affecting bioinformatics analysis of scRNA data, could be present because fresh samples were required for the present study; however, we did attempt to remove batch effects with Seurat V3 in this study.\nIn summary, our study revealed the functional state, clinical significance, and intercellular communication of immunosuppressive cells in HCC at single-cell resolution. Furthermore, we found that immunosuppressive cells exhibit intensive potential intercellular crosstalk to foster an immunosuppressive niche in the HCC TME. Intriguingly, PVR/PVRL2, which are upregulated and unfavorable prognostic factors in HCC, interact with TIGIT and act as a prominent coinhibitory signal in the TME and was determined in vitro. Collectively, our scRNA-seq data suggested that targeting the TIGIT-PVR/PVRL2 axis with blocking antibodies might be a promising efficacious therapy strategy in HCC.\nFrontiers in Immunology 12"
