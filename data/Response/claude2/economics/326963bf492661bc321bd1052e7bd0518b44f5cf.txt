 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct research to better understand the mechanisms through which conditional cash transfers reduce early pregnancy and childbearing. The review found suggestive evidence that CCTs are more effective than UCTs, but more research is needed on the pathways involved. 

2. Examine whether the impact of cash transfers on reducing early pregnancy persists after the transfers end. The studies in the review measured outcomes during or shortly after the intervention period. Longer-term follow-up could provide insight into sustainability.

3. Investigate the optimal design of cash transfer programs, including amount, payment frequency, and duration, to maximize contraceptive use and reduce early pregnancy. The heterogeneity of programs in the review makes it difficult to identify the ideal structure.

4. Explore the effectiveness of cash transfers in reducing early pregnancy in regions and countries not well represented in the current evidence base, such as West Africa and South Asia. Most studies were conducted in Latin America and East/Southern Africa.

5. Conduct research on unconditional cash transfers and their impact on the outcomes of interest, as most studies focused on conditional cash transfers. There is a need for more evidence on UCTs specifically targeting adolescent girls and young women.
