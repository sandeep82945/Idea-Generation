conclusion Summarily, this study examined the various physicochemical parameters and heavy metal concentrations of soil and water samples from Ilesha gold mining sites. HM-resistant bacteria were also isolated from the samples and were subsequently subjected to a MIC test to ascertain their resistance levels to various heavy metals including Pb, Co, Cd, Zn, and Hg while the molecular characterization of the isolated bacteria was performed. Molecular characterization revealed Priestia aryabhattai and Enterobacter cloacae as the isolates capable of resisting the high concentration of heavy metals. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first in which the ability of Priestia aryabhattai to resist varying concentrations of Pb, Co, Cd, Zn, and Hg was explored and is also the first to report the presence of heavy metal-resisting Enterobacter cloacae in the Ilesha gold mining site.
