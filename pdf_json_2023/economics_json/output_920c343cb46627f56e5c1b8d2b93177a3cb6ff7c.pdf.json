Then, corresponding hypotheses are proposed, and the questionnaire is designed. Finally, reliability, validity, correlation, and regression analysis are applied to analyze the sample structure and the relationships between various variables. The experimental results show that the reliability and validity detection values are higher than 0.8 and 0.75, respectively, indicating that the reliability and validity of the questionnaire designed are qualified. In the correlation analysis, the hypothesis proposed is validated through correlation coefficients, and the rationality of the hypothesis is further verified through regression analysis.",

            "text": "With the rapid development and popularization of Internet technology, China\u2019s Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) e-commerce market has risen rapidly and has become one of the main ways for consumers to exchange goods and services (Saylam and Y\u0131ld\u0131z, 2022). According to the China e-Business Research Center, the C2C e-commerce market has maintained a rapid growth momentum in the past few years and is expected to maintain strong growth in the future. This trend has not only changed the landscape of traditional retail but also provided consumers with a more convenient and diversified shopping experience.\nHowever, despite the booming C2C e-commerce market, consumers still face a range of risks and challenges when making online transactions. The issue of trust is one of the most important factors for consumers in C2C e-commerce (Leonard and Jones, 2021). Unlike traditional face-toface transactions, buyers and sellers on C2C e-commerce platforms often have no physical contact and are difficult to directly establish a trusting relationship. Consumers\u2019 concerns about counterfeit goods, false publicity, payment risks, and transaction disputes may discourage their willingness to purchase (Leung et al., 2020).\nIn addition, perceived benefits are an important factor influencing consumers\u2019 purchase intention on C2C e-commerce platforms. The more consumers perceive the benefits of a transaction, including those in terms of price concessions, product quality, after-sales service, and shopping experience, the more likely they are to choose to make a purchase on a C2C e-commerce platform. Therefore, understanding consumers\u2019 expectations and evaluations of perceived benefits and the impact of these factors on purchase intention is important to improve consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions and facilitate transaction completion.\nIn this context, this work aims to explore the relationship among trust, perceived benefit, and purchase intention in C2C e-commerce in China and verify these relationships through empirical testing. Through the in-depth study of these key factors, the characteristics of C2C e-commerce transactions and the laws of consumer behavior can be revealed, and useful enlightenment and decision-making support can be provided for e-commerce platform operators and decision-makers. Based on previous research, this work proposes a series of hypotheses and designs corresponding questionnaires to collect empirical data. The innovation of this work is to explore the relationship among trust, perceived benefit, and purchase intention in C2C e-commerce from a multi-dimensional perspective. First, the relationship between sample structure and variables is analyzed and verified by statistical methods, such as reliability, validity, correlation, and regression analysis. Meanwhile, correlation coefficients and regression analysis are used to explore the significant relationship and mutual influence among trust, perceived benefit, and purchase intention. Second, the perceived benefits of consumers to C2C e-commerce exchanges are studied. Finally, the performance and influencing factors of consumers\u2019 purchase intention in the C2C e-commerce environment are studied. Consumer behavior and decision-making drivers are better understood to provide new insights into research and practice in e-commerce by deeply analyzing the interplay of these key factors."

            "text": "Regarding the discussions on purchase intention, Bueno and Gallego (2021) found that consumers\u2019 perceived risks to sub-optimal food came from health, social, and quality risks rather than financial and psychological risks. Consumers had a significantly higher perceived health risk for defective suboptimal foods than the other three sub-optimal foods and a considerably higher perceived social risk and perceived quality risk for expiring sub-optimal foods than the other three sub-optimal foods. The personal characteristic information of consumers would have a significant impact on perceived risk. Perceived quality, health, and social risks significantly negatively affected consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase sub-optimal food. However, financial and psychological risks\u2019 impact on purchase intention was insignificant (Bueno and Gallego, 2021). Wang and Dai (2022) first analyzed the current operating and purchasing status of agricultural products on a certain e-commerce platform. They surveyed the willingness of residents in the study area to purchase agricultural products on the e-commerce platform. Subsequently, a survey questionnaire was set up based on literature and theoretical models and distributed and collected. Last, the valid sample results were organized, and Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) analysis was conducted to identify the factors that affect consumers\u2019 purchase intention. Once again, based on the questionnaire results, the problems with consumers\u2019 purchasing intentions were summarized and organized. It was found that there were issues with consumers\u2019 imbalanced willingness to purchase agricultural products, weak willingness to use, and\nweak willingness to repurchase on e-commerce platforms. In response to the above issues, the reasons for the perceived reduction in customer coverage, diversion of consumers through multiple purchasing channels, and poor consumer experience were identified (Wang and Dai, 2022). Pei et al. (2021) found that the environmental protection knowledge and green product knowledge accumulated by consumers in their daily lives positively impacted their perceived value and willingness to purchase green. Moreover, consumers\u2019 subjective perception of the comprehensive effectiveness of green products and their brands played a vital role in generating green purchasing intention. Among them, the perception of environmental value had the most substantial impact on green purchase intention. The perceived value of consumers based on green consumption knowledge had a positive mesomeric effect on their green purchase intention (Pei et al., 2021).\nBased on the above research review, consumers\u2019 purchase intention is affected by several factors. Previous studies have shown that purchase intention is influenced by factors, such as perceived risk, personal characteristic information, green knowledge, and brand comprehensive utility. However, in China\u2019s C2C e-commerce, the relationship among trust, perceived benefit, and purchase intention still needs to be deepened. The innovation of this work is to focus on the Chinese C2C e-commerce market and explore the relationship among trust, perceived benefit, and purchase intention. Unlike traditional research, this work examines these key factors from a multidimensional perspective and reveals the interactions between them. Through empirical testing, the comprehensive impact of these factors on purchase intention is verified, and Chinese consumers are used as research objects to provide specific insights and guidance for e-commerce platform operators and decision-makers."

            "text": "Purchase Intention in C2C E-Commerce The discussion on trust has been involved in fields such as psychology, philosophy, sociology, economics, and organizational theory (Purwandari et al., 2022). The importance of trust in commodity trading is even more evident. Especially with the progress of e-commerce, both parties\u2019 anonymity and information asymmetry in the transaction have highlighted the importance of trust, which hasdramatically affected the transaction behavior (Antwi-Afari et al., 2022). In the current research, no unified definition of trust can cover all its meanings at different levels. This is because trust is an abstract and multidimensional concept used interchangeably with other concepts, such as trustworthiness and reliability in practical research. It also includes dimensions such as cognition, emotion, and behavior (Kim et al., 2020). However, the definition of trust mainly has two perspectives: cognitive perspective and behavioral perspective (Hou et al., 2021). From a cognitive perspective, trust is a belief, willingness, and attitude that primarily focuses on the trustworthy attributes of trading partners, such as goodwill, integrity, and ability, and is established based on these attributes (S\u00e1nchez et al., 2021). From the behavior perspective, trust is believed to be a behavior taken by the trusting party to satisfy consumer interests or even harm their interests in situations of risk and uncertainty (Lee, 2022). In the C2C environment, trust has different definitions. Figure 1 presents the specific content.\nIn Figure 1, trust in the C2C environment can be divided into trade relations and trading environment. Specifically, online trust in a trade relationship refers to the relationship between consumers and sellers. Online trust in the context of a transaction refers to the relationship between the consumer and the transaction website.\nIn the C2C business environment, perceived benefits mainly refer to consumers\u2019 perception and evaluation of transaction-related factors, so it can be considered that perceived benefits are the reputation of merchants (Schwob et al., 2023). The specific content of perceived benefits includes five points, and Figure 2 shows the details.\nThe five perceived benefits in Figure 2 include transaction security, product quality perception, perceived service quality, value perception, and social perception.\nPerceived benefits are closely related to trust. Perceived benefits can lead to the generation of trust, but the generation of trust does not rely solely on perceived benefits (Gomes et al., 2020). In online transactions, the separation of the parties involved makes it more difficult to form trust (Zahara et al., 2021). It should be noted that different people have different perceived benefits for C2C transactions. In C2C transactions, merchants should continuously improve their services and quality to meet the needs of more consumers (Cerdan and Darcy, 2021). Consumer behavior research is widely valued in marketing, covering multiple fields such as sociology, psychology, advertising, marketing, and communication (Le et al., 2021). Understanding and studying consumers\u2019 psychological states and behavioral patterns during market transactions is significant for developing better marketing strategies (Yeap et al., 2022). Consumer purchase intention belongs to the category of consumer behavioral intention, and behavioral intention is an essential concept in attitude theory (Qin et al., 2021). The attitude theory believes that cognition, emotion, and intention constitute attitude. Cognition includes an individual\u2019s knowledge and beliefs, emotions refer to their feelings, and intentions refer to their willingness to act (Kusuma et al., 2020). Figure 3 is a theoretical model.\nThe main components of the purchase intention model in Figure 3 are behavioral beliefs, behavioral consequences evaluation, following motivation, behavioral attitudes, subjective norms, behavioral intentions, and practical actions.\nIn e-commerce transactions, when consumers cannot touch the product and have difficulty understanding relevant product information, the perceived benefit evaluation mechanism can help consumers identify and select sellers (Castillo-Sotomayor et al., 2023). Consumers will choose sellers with good reputations, believe that the seller has goodwill and integrity, can complete the transaction, form a purchasing intention, and finally take purchasing action (Qu et al., 2022)."

The evaluation mechanism of the transaction platform reputation is applied to classify the user\u2019s trading behavior based on information such as store level, dynamic rating, and seller reviews (Feng and Chen, 2022). It is divided into three dimensions: accumulated member credit, dynamic store score, and online comment (Mameri et al., 2020). Table 1 displays the specific meanings of each dimension.\nThis work also divides trust into three dimensions: goodwill trust, integrity trust, and ability trust (Trehan and Sharma, 2021). Table 2 displays the specific content.\nThe definition of purchase intention is the possibility for consumers to purchase goods in online stores using the internet as a carrier. The stronger the consumer\u2019s willingness to buy is, the greater the likelihood of purchase is (Zhang et al., 2022). Based on the above information, this work proposes the following hypotheses. Table 3 shows the specific content."

The respondents rate the situation described in the questionnaire from \u201ccompletely disagree\u201d to \u201ccompletely agree\u201d according to their browsing experience of a store based on purchasing goods on Taobao (Ansari and Sanayei, 2020). Meanwhile, corresponding scores are assigned: 1 point, 2 points, 3 points, 4 points, 5 points, 6 points, and 7 points (Moriuchi and Takahashi, 2023). The questionnaire consists of 33 questions, including four parts. Table 4 presents the specific content.\nSPSS has powerful statistical analysis capabilities and a wide range of applications. As a professional statistical software, SPSS provides a wealth of statistical methods and analysis tools, which can meet the needs of this study. With SPSS, statistical operations, such as reliability, validity, correlation, and regression analysis can be performed to verify the relationship between sample structure and variables to further reveal the influence mechanism between trust, perceived benefit, and purchase intention.After the data collection, this work mainly uses the statistical software SPSS25.0 as an analysis tool.

After removing 55 invalid questionnaires, 321 valid questionnaires are obtained, with an effective rate of 85.4%. The proportion of males and females participating in the questionnaire survey is balanced, with 49.8% of males and 50.2% of females. Young people aged 18-27 account for over 95% of the sample size. Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 coefficient is selected as the reliability indicator for testing. When the coefficient is more significant than 0.7, it indicates that the reliability of the questionnaire is high. When the coefficient is between 0.6 and 0.7, it is also acceptable. Figure 4 displays the reliability of the questionnaire.\nIn Figure 4, A represents accumulated member credit, B represents dynamic store scores, C represents online reviews, D represents goodwill trust, E represents integrity trust, F represents ability trust, and G represents purchase intention. Figure 4 shows that Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 coefficients are\nall greater than 0.8 and can reach a maximum of 0.93, indicating that this questionnaire has high reliability and acceptable internal consistency. Validity analysis uses Kaiser Meyer Olkin (KMO) values and Bartlett\u2019s test. It is generally believed that it is suitable for factor analysis when the KMO value is more significant than 0.7. When it is between 0.6 and 0.7, factor analysis can be performed. When the KMO value is below 0.6, it is unsuitable for factor analysis. Factor analysis can be achieved when the significance probability of Bartlett\u2019s test value is less than or equal to the significance level. Figure 5 displays the experimental results.\nThe analysis in Figure 5 shows that the KMO values of perceived benefit, trust, and purchase intention are 0.868, 0.852, and 0.749, respectively, all above the recommended threshold of 0.7. This\nindicates that the sample data have good usability and adaptability for factor analysis. In addition, by observing the value of the significance probability, it can be found that the significant probability of perceived benefit, trust, and purchase intention are all 0, which is less than the set significance level. This means that there is a significant correlation among perceived interest, trust, and purchase intention in the sample data with other variables, which is consistent with the study requirements. In summary, the data of perceived benefit, trust, and purchase intention have good availability and adaptability in factor analysis, and there is a significant correlation with other variables. This lays a foundation for further exploring the relationship among perceived benefit, trust, and purchase intention and provides reliable data support for subsequent regression analysis."

P&I refers to perceived benefits and integrity trust. P&A refers to perceived benefits and ability trust. Figure 6 shows, first, that at a significance level of 0.01, cumulated member credit and online reviews have a significant impact on goodwill trust. This indicates a positive correlation between member points, online reviews, and goodwill trust. Dynamic store ratings have no effect on goodwill trust, while online reviews have a higher impact on goodwill trust than cumulated member credit. The results of regression analysis verify the hypothesis H1a and H3a.\nSecond, at a significance level of 0.05, dynamic store ratings have a significant impact on integrity trust. The impact of online reviews on integrity trust is significant at a significance level of 0.01. The impact of online reviews on integrity trust is more significant than that of store dynamics, while accumulated member credit has no impact on integrity trust. The results of regression analysis verify the hypothesis H2b and H3b.\nThird, at a significance level of 0.01, cumulated member credit and online reviews have a significant impact on ability trust. Online reviews have a greater impact on integrity trust than member credit, while dynamic store scores have no impact on ability trust. The results of regression analysis verify the hypothesis H1c and H3c.\nFigure 7 shows the regression analysis results of purchase intention, perceived benefits, and trust. Figure 7 reveals that all three trust variables enter the regression equation. That is, the explanatory variables in the regression equation include goodwill trust, integrity trust, and ability trust. The significance probability corresponding to the variable T value is 0, indicating a significant linear relationship between goodwill trust, integrity trust, ability trust, and customer purchase intention. The established regression equation is valid. Besides, the regression equation shows that integrity trust has the most significant impact on customer purchase intention, followed by goodwill trust, while ability trust has a more minor impact. The regression analysis results also validate the previous research hypotheses H4a, H4b, and H4c. In the regression analysis of purchase intention and perceived benefits, the significance probability corresponding to the variable T value is 0. It can be considered that there is a significant linear relationship between accumulated member credit, dynamic store score, online comments, and customer purchase intention. The established regression equation is valid. Moreover, the regression equation shows that online reviews have the most significant impact on customer purchase intention, followed by dynamic store reviews, while the accumulated member credit has a more minor impact.

            "text": "On C2C e-commerce platforms, factors, such as the level of trust between buyers and sellers, the perceived benefits of transactions, and the purchase intention, have become key factors affecting the success of e-commerce transactions. Corresponding hypotheses are proposed by explaining the application of trust, perceived benefit, and purchase intention in C2C, and questionnaires are designed for investigation. The relationship between sample structure and variables is analyzed through reliability, validity, correlation, and regression analysis. The results of the study show that:\n(1) The reliability and internal consistency of the questionnaire are high, and it meets the acceptance criteria. (2) All KMO values are higher than 0.75, which verifies the validity of the questionnaire. (3) There is a correlation between cumulated member credit, dynamic store ratings, and online reviews and trust in goodwill, integrity, and ability. (4) The hypothesis H1a, H1b, H1c, H2a, H2b, H2c, H3a, H3b, and H3c are validated. (5) There is a positive correlation between goodwill trust, integrity trust, and ability trust and purchase intention. (6) The hypothesis H4a and H5b are validated.\nCompared with previous studies, this work not only is innovative in methodology but also provides valuable empirical research for the academic development of the field. However, there are some drawbacks. It only considers the relationship between trust, perceived benefit, and purchase intention but not their mediating role. In future research, the mediating role of consumer trust in perceived benefits and purchase intentions can be further explored. In conclusion, this work provides useful insights for understanding the relationship among trust, perceived benefit, and purchase intention on C2C e-commerce platforms. Future research can build on this and compare with previous studies to delve deeper into relevant questions."
