In internet hospitals, specialist outpatient online consultations (SOOC) are the primary services. However, the acceptance and utilization rates of this service are still low. Thus, the study of patients\u2019 choice preferences for SOOC is needed.\nObjective: To analyze the choice preference of patients\u2019 SOOC via a discrete choice experiment, understand the influence of each factor and promote the development of internet hospitals.\nMethods: Via a discrete selection experiment, a total of 162 patients from two general hospitals and three specialized hospitals in Beijing were selected for the questionnaire survey. The choice preferenceswere analyzed by conditional logit regression.\nResults: From high to low, patients\u2019 willingness to pay (WTP) for the attributes of SOOC is as follows: doctors\u2019 recommendation rate (\u03b2highly recommend = 0.999), the convenience of applying SOOC services (\u03b2Convenient = 0.760), the increasing ratio of medical insurance payment for online services compared to o ine (\u03b2Increase by 10% = 0.545), and the disease\u2019s severity (\u03b2severe = \u22123.024). The results of the subgroup analysis showed di erences in patient choice preference by age, whether the patients had chronic diseases, income, and medical insurance types.\nConclusion: Both price and nonprice attributes influence the choice preference of SOOC for patients. Among them, patients are more inclined to choose SOOC when doctors highly recommend it, when it is convenient to apply, when medical insurance increases by 10%, and when disease severity is mild. The current findings show the government and medical institutions formulate auxiliary policies and welfare strategies by clarifying core attributes and adjusting the levels of di erent attributes to improve patients\u2019 acceptance of SOOC. The utility of SOOC and the further development of internet hospitals are radically promoted.\nKEYWORDS\ninternet hospitals, specialist outpatient online consultations (SOOC), preference, discrete choice experiment, logit regression\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "With the background of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID19), more and more people use online consultations of internet hospitals. Internet hospitals are a newmedical healthcare service in China and are also the public facilities for doctors to conduct diagnosis and treatment activities based on the internet. Since 2015, the Chinese government has begun to positively publish the policy to motivate the development of internet hospitals as part of \u201cHealthy China\u201d. This policy stimulated the enthusiasm of brick-and-mortar hospitals to establish internet hospitals, leading to a rapid increase in internet hospitals (1). Generally, internet hospitals provide subsequent treatment services such as online consultations, prescriptions, and family doctor services for patients. Among them, specialist outpatient online consultations (SOOC) are the primary service. Usually, patients diagnosed with common illnesses and chronic diseases in offline hospitals can utilize the internet hospitals\u2019 resources to receive subsequent treatment from doctors online.\nInternet hospitals bring significant benefits, including improved healthcare quality, efficiency and cost containment, especially for chronic patients (2). China is the country with the second-highest investment in telemedicine systems, but internet hospitals\u2019 acceptance and utilization rates are still low (3). A better understanding of the shortcomings of SOOCs is important. This study chooses Beijing as the sample since the most reputable Chinese internet hospitals are concentrated mostly in this city. However, in research on 2021 BeijingMedical Insurance Bureau statistics, only 300,000 visits from 32 Beijing internet hospitals are found, which means there are only 20 appointments per day in each hospital (4). Accordingly, the utilization rate of Beijing internet hospitals is low. Previous studies found that patients\u2019 choice preferences may affect internet hospitals\u2019 utilization rate and acceptance, and the disease severity, as well as socio-demographic factors such as age and income, can have an impact on patients\u2019 choice preferences (5\u20137). Another study also found that the availability and flexibility of online consultation platforms also affect patients\u2019 choice preferences (8). Thus, understanding the variable of patients\u2019 choice preferences is vital to expanding the number of internet hospitals.\nResearchers have analyzed different views in a previous study of patients\u2019 choice preferences in online consultations. In summary, these views are primarily concentrated on two aspects: the influence of patients\u2019 attributes on healthseeking behavior and the influence of external conditions on health-seeking behavior. Patient attributes mainly involve age,\nAbbreviations: DCE, Discrete Choice Experiment; UEBMI, Urban\nEmployee Basic Medical Insurance; URRBMI, Urban and Rural Residents\u2019\nBasic Medical Insurance; WTP, Willingness to Pay; SOOC, Specialist\nOutpatient Online Consultations.\ngender, income, disease severity, and medical awareness (9\u2013 11). External conditions mainly entail social networks, family factors, treatment distance, price, and medical insurance. The external conditions faced by patients can be further divided into those of medical institutions and social factors (12). At present, most existing research focuses on market surveys of SOOC preferences (13\u201315). At the same time, there are few studies analyzing patients\u2019 preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) against the unique background of internet hospitals in China. Measuring the effect of each attribute and the advantage of using internet hospitals are still the primary concerns. Therefore, this study will research the patients\u2019 choice preference for SOOCs and the influence on each attribute.\nBased on China\u2019s unique internet hospitals model, this study will use the discrete choice experiment (DCE)method to analyze the patient group\u2019s choice preference and WTP and put forward targeted strategies and policy suggestions to promote the use of SOOCs by patients and promote the further the development of SOOCs."

In this study, DCE first set up various groups of attributes of SOOCs. Then, DCE elicited patient preferences for various attributes and quantified the value of these attributes by estimating the WTP. For instance, patients need to consider their choices comprehensively and balance these attributes. Each scenario contains different levels of predefined attributes (see, for example, Figure 1). Then, the discrete model estimates the parameters of different attributes through many aspects, such as measuring the value of each attribute by setting continuous variables, including price in a questionnaire, measuring the importance of each relative factor through regression coefficients, and analyzing the different preferences from different groups by stratification or grouping."

Chinese medical insurance is divided into Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI), Urban and Rural Residents\u2019 Basic Medical Insurance (URRBMI) and other insurance, covering nearly 100% of the population. UEBMI was established for individuals employed in the urban sector. URRBMI was implemented to cover urban residents without formal employment and the large rural population. During the survey, the investigator will explain the meaning of each attribute to the patient in detail. For disease severity, the investigator will assume a disease such as hypertension to the patient as an example. When a follow-up visit for medication is needed, it is a mild condition. When rehabilitation guidance is needed, it is a moderate condition. When unstable blood pressure requires a diagnosis, it is a severe condition. For the doctors\u2019 recommendation rate, when the doctor does not inform patients of the SOOC approach, it means the doctor weakly recommends it. When the doctor informs patients about the SOOC approach, it means the doctor generally recommends it. When the doctor suggests that the patient can take SOOC services next time, it means the doctor highly recommends it."

The basis of this experiment is to determine the attributes and levels, then combine distinct levels and attributes and finally confirm the optional subject combinations that patients select. Generally, this experiment is critical when many optional subject combinations are derived from a large number of attributes and the corresponding level of attributes, which will increase the difficulty of the DCE design. Therefore, in\nthe actual operation process, the orthogonal design method is often used to determine the optional subject combination and select the representative optional subject combinations for the experimental operation to grasp the overall situation. In addition, of all the final optional subject combinations, the appropriate one should be selected as the control group, and the rest should be paired with it to form different selection sets. In this study, 18 groups of optional subject combinations were determined, and the 9th group was selected as the control group. The rest of the optional subject combinations were paired with the 9th group, forming 17 groups of selection sets (Table 2)."

Among the inclusion criteria for patient selection were: firstly, patients who were over 18 years old, had been seen at our hospital, had a better understanding of the consultation process, and could clearly express their personal opinions and views. Secondly, patients who voluntarily participated in this survey and gave informed consent. Thirdly, patients who had previous experience with online consultation. Before administering the survey, we asked patients whether they had used any SOOC services before. For those who answer yes, we invited them to participate in the survey.\nAlthough we randomized the sample as much as possible, the actual survey process is still subject to patient self-selection bias, including sample bias and hypothesis bias.

Then, before the survey, we established the survey team. The team members received thorough training from the researcher to explain the investigation background, questionnaire design, and factors that need attention. During the process, trained members verbally presented each attribute and its level to the respondent. They were responsible for monitoring and guiding the process and carefully checking the quality and completeness of the questionnaire after the respondents filled it in.\nFor hypothesis bias, we assume that patients\u2019 choices reflect their true underlying preferences. Two strategies can be used to try to reduce the bias. One approach\nis for our trained investigators to explain this potential bias to patients and encourage them to consider it more carefully (18). Another approach is to use anonymous surveys to help reduce bias. This is because patients may deliberately misrepresent their true preferences during the actual survey.\nIn addition, this study used Johnson and Orme\u2019s rule of thumb to determine the minimum sample size of the main effect DCE model, which is mainly determined by three factors: the number of DCE questions, the number of options, and the maximum level of attributes (19). The formula isN > 500c/t\u2217\u03b1, where 500 is a fixed variable, c represents the maximum number\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 04 frontiersin.org\nof levels in any attribute, t represents the number of DCE questions in each questionnaire, and \u03b1 refers to the number of options in each question. This formula has been argued to be reasonable and widely used in studies (20\u201322). Therefore, according to the above formula, the sample size of patients in this study should be >89 (t = 17, \u03b1 = 2, c = 6, n > 89), which is considered reasonable. By also considering invalid questionnaires, this study finally determined that at least 120 patients were surveyed."

            "text": "The method adopted in this study is the discrete choice experiment (DCE), a stated preference survey. It explores respondents\u2019 preferences andWTP by studying how they choose between different attribute levels and price conditions so that decisions can be made directly, rationally, and realistically (16). It has been widely used in health economics and policy research and used to inform the design of health care services (24\u201326). When designing health service plans and formulating health policies, it is necessary for policy-makers to understand what factors can affect patients\u2019 choice preferences for services such as the SOOCs provided by internet hospitals. DCE is an effective way to achieve this.\nInitially, this study compared patient perceptions of SOOCs with offline consultations. The results suggest that most patients are willing to use SOOCs. However, they still feel that the quality and accuracy of SOOCs are lower than offline consultations, and there are certain technical risks. The specific outcome is as follows. In terms of user experience, most people think that the doctor\u2019s attitudes and the simplicity of the process during SOOCs are the same as or better than those during offline consultations. In terms of service quality, only 7.4% of people think that the quality of SOOCs is higher than that\nof offline consultations. In terms of technical risks, more than half of patients believe that SOOCs are less accurate than offline consultations. Studies fromChina and abroad have found that low patient willingness to choose online consultations is associated with patient concerns about the quality of online consultation services, particularly about the accuracy of treatment (27, 28). This may be related to some factors, such as the immature technology of online consultations, insufficient protection of confidential data, and unsound laws and regulations, which make the safety guarantee and liability tracing of SOOCs more difficult than offline consultations.\nThen, this study analyzed the factors influencing patient choice preference. The patient\u2019s preferences for the attributes, from high to low, are the doctor\u2019s recommendation rate (\u03b2highly recommend = 0.999), the convenience level of applying SOOC services (\u03b2Convenient = 0.760), the increasing ratio in medical insurance payment for online services compared to offline (\u03b2Increase by 10% = 0.545), and the disease severity (\u03b2severe = \u22123.024). The reasons why these four attributes affect their preferences are explained as follows. Doctor-patient information asymmetry is the main reason why a doctor\u2019s recommendation rate has a great impact on patient preferences. Usually, patients have insufficient awareness of internet hospitals and their disease conditions, and doctors, as service providers,\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 11 frontiersin.org"

Therefore, patients will trust the doctor\u2019s point of view, and the doctors\u2019 recommendations can definitely influence patients\u2019 choices. The second statistically significant factor is the convenience of accessing SOOC services. A study from the United Kingdom found that busy young people had a lower preference for offline consultations and a higher preference for online consultations (30), which was explained by the more attractive convenience of online consultations. The third factor is the increasing ratio of medical insurance payment for online services compared with offline rates, which determines how much patients\u2019 economic benefits can be increased. It could also affect patients\u2019 acceptance and affordability of SOOCs. The last factor is disease severity. The regression coefficient for this variable is negative, which indicates that disease severity is negatively correlated with patients\u2019 choice preferences. Patients with more severe illnesses or injuries are more likely to choose SOOCs for physical examinations and treatments (31), which cannot be met by offline consultations. With the change in the level of attributes, this study also finds that disease severity and doctors\u2019 rate of recommendation have the greatest impact on the probability of patients\u2019 selecting SOOCs. For instance, when the other attribute levels remain the same, but the disease is milder or the doctor\u2019s recommendation rate is higher, patients have a higher probability of choosing a SOOC. Notably, the results of\nthis study showed that the attribute of one-way trip distance to the hospital did not have a significant effect on patient choice preference. This is inconsistent with previous studies. A study from Pakistan suggested that the attribute of distance to hospital may have a significant impact on patients\u2019 choice preferences in underdeveloped areas (32). The possible reason was that the number of patients from other provinces or cities who were treated in the hospitals of Beijing decreased due to COVID-19. In our survey, 79% of the respondents were<2 h from the offline hospital. So, the distance factor did not have a significant effect on local patients.\nIn addition, according to the evaluation results of the monetary value of each attribute, patients\u2019 WTP for disease severity is higher than other attributes. Compared with mild disease severity, patients\u2019 WTP for severe diseases is the weakest, at U \u2212112.00. This means that if patients suffer from severe diseases, the SOOC will only be selected when they pay U 112.00 less than before. When patients perceive that their diseases are severe, they often have a greater demand for faceto-face communication with doctors and physical examinations. Most of them will undergo emergency and complex treatments, including surgery and hospitalization. These services are not available in the SOOC model. Unlike other factors, disease severity is directly related to the patient\u2019s future health, so patients are willing to pay more for quick and reliable treatment.\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 12 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Prior exploration found that patients with mild and moderate diseases would utilize SOOCs more frequently (33).\nThe conditional logit model further suggested the existence of WTP heterogeneity among patients with different sociodemographic characteristics. First, the WTP of patients in the low-age group was higher than that of patients in the high-age group, which is consistent with the finding of a cross-sectional study from Japan (34). That study indicated that during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an overall increase in the use of online consultations by the patient group, younger patients were still more likely to use it than older patients. This finding can probably be attributed to the ability of younger patients to accept new things and learn digital technologies, which also reflects a technological gap and a digital divide caused by age (35\u201337). Second, the WTP of most patients in the high-income group was higher than that of the patients in the low-income group, which echoes the findings of previous research in the United States (38). This is mainly because high-income patients prefer to spend more money for more convenient services and better medical experiences. Third, the findings revealed that patients with different medical insurance types have different WTPs for different attributes. Among them, disease severity has a greater impact on the WTP for patients with UEBMI, and the medical insurance payment\nfor online services reimbursement ratio has a greater impact on the WTP for patients with URRBMI and other types of medical insurance. The reason may be that UEBMI provides patients greater compensation benefits than URRBMI and other medical insurance. Patients with UEBMI are more concerned about whether their disease conditions are suitable for using SOOCs, so they have a higher WTP for severe diseases. Due to the lower compensation levels of URRBMI and other medical insurances, the medical insurance payment for online services reimbursement ratio is a greater concern for patients with these medical insurances; thus, they have a higher WTP for the increasing ratio in medical insurance payment for online services compared with offline services. Finally, this study found that the WTP of patients with nonchronic diseases was basically higher than that of patients with chronic diseases. On the one hand, patients with chronic diseases are mostly older, and older patients have a lower WTP. On the other hand, for patients with chronic diseases, their symptoms may be complex, the treatment cycle may be long, and multiple departments are often involved. To effectively and conveniently handle chronic diseases, internet hospitals that provide SOOCs need to meet various stringent requirements. However, they are not mature or developed enough to meet them currently.

Therefore, when the level of most attributes is adjusted, the WTP of patients with chronic diseases is generally lower.\nThe above analysis provides many directions for developing policy recommendations to improve the SOOC system. On the one hand, as price factors play a significant role in patients\u2019 choice preferences, health authorities in China should reasonably price the SOOCs and appropriately increase the medical insurance payment for online services reimbursement ratio for patients who are eligible for online services, such as those with chronic diseases (39). However, since the convenience of accessing SOOC services is widely considered, it should be emphasized in policy and used as an indispensable indicator of service quality. Previous studies confirmed that the perceived ease of use of SOOC services is a determinant of patients\u2019 adoption intention toward the online service (40, 41), especially among older adults (31). Accordingly, internet hospitals should be patient-centered, further optimize the service delivery process to improve the ease of using SOOCs and provide patients with multiple convenient and easy-to-use channels to consult doctors, such as internet hospital apps and WeChat official accounts (6, 14). In addition, since doctors\u2019 recommendations have a significant impact on patients\u2019 choices, publicity and training for doctors should be strengthened so that patients have a better understanding of and trust in the SOOC model, thereby increasing their use of it."

            "text": "This study contributes to the knowledge of patients\u2019 choice preferences for SOOCs. Nonetheless, some limitations should be noted in this study. The first is that this study analyzes the stated preferences of the respondents to hypothetical scenarios, which may not necessarily reflect the choices they would make in a real setting. Consistency between revealed preferences and stated preferences should be explored in future research. The second limitation is that although the sample size in this study met the requirements of the experiment, it still needs to be expanded in future studies. And patients\u2019 choice preferences for long distances from the hospital need to be explored in a follow-up study. SOOCs face different situations in different regions. When formulating relevant policies, various practical factors, including social background, need to be comprehensively considered. The generalization of the findings requires further research."

Among them, disease severity and the doctor\u2019s recommendation\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 15 frontiersin.org\nrate have the most significant effect, revealing that appropriate diseases and effective physician-patient interactions are essential for driving the SOOC model. The attributes that influence whether patients are more inclined to choose SOOCs are as follows: doctors\u2019 high recommendation, the convenience of accessing SOOC services, when the ratio of medical insurance payment for online services compared with offline is 10% higher, and a mild disease severity. Patients under 40 years old, with high incomes or nonchronic diseases generally have a higher WTP. Based on the findings, patients\u2019 preferences and WTP for SOOCs will be enhanced by increasing the medical insurance payment for online services reimbursement ratio, optimizing the service delivery process, developing humanized and convenient systems for patients of advanced age, and training doctors to provide patients with more professional recommendations and interpretations about SOOCs."
