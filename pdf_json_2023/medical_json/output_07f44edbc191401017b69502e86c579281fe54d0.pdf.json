    "abstractText": "Trichomonas vaginalis is responsible for 156 million new cases per year worldwide. When present asymptomatically, the parasite can lead to serious complications, such as development of cervical and prostate cancer. As infection increases the acquisition and transmission of HIV, the control of trichomoniasis represents an important niche for the discovery and development of new antiparasitic molecules. This urogenital parasite synthesizes several molecules that allow the establishment and pathogenesis of infection. Among them, peptidases occupy key roles as virulence factors, and the inhibition of these enzymes has become an important mechanism for modulating pathogenesis. Based on these premises, our group recently reported the potent anti-T. vaginalis action of the metal-based complex [Cu(phendione)3](ClO4)2.4H2O (Cu-phendione). In the present study, we evaluated the influence of Cu-phendione on the modulation of proteolytic activities produced by T. vaginalis by biochemical and molecular approaches. Cu-phendione showed strong inhibitory potential against T. vaginalis peptidases, especially cysteineand metallo-type peptidases. The latter revealed a more prominent effect at both the post-transcriptional and post-translational levels. Molecular Docking analysis confirmed the interaction of Cu-phendione, with high binding energy (\u22129.7 and \u221210.7 kcal\u00b7mol\u22121, respectively) at the active site of both TvMP50 and TvGP63 metallopeptidases. In addition, Cu-phendione significantly reduced trophozoite-mediated cytolysis in human vaginal (HMVII) and monkey kidney (VERO) epithelial cell lineages. These results highlight the antiparasitic potential of Cu-phendione by interaction with important T. vaginalis virulence factors.",

            "text": "Trichomoniasis is among the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infectious diseases. It is caused by the widespread obligate extracellular parasitic protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 156 million new cases of trichomoniasis are reported worldwide per year [1]. Although many cases remain asymptomatic, patient complaints include the presence of itching, discharge, and local inflammation [2]. In addition, the presence of the parasite can lead to serious complications generated by the production of key molecules (e.g., different classes\nPathogens 2023, 12, 745. https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens12050745 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pathogens\nPathogens 2023, 12, 745 2 of 18\nof extracellular hydrolytic enzymes) that allow the establishment and pathogenesis of infection. For example, T. vaginalis genome sequencing has demonstrated the presence of 440 peptidases\u2019 coding genes responsible for composing the degradome of T. vaginalis, acting in both physiological and pathological events that culminate in a successful infectious process. In general, peptidases are hydrolytic enzymes able to cleave peptide bonds in peptides/proteins, and are classified depending on the amino acid/metal present in their catalytic site that is responsible for binding and cleaving proteinaceous substrates [3]. Trichomonas vaginalis peptidases are classified as cysteine (total of 220 genes), metallo (123 genes), serine (80 genes), threonine (17 genes), and aspartic (6 genes) peptidases. Metallo (MP) and cysteine (CP) peptidases are responsible for more than half of proteolytic diversity in T. vaginalis [4]. CPs have about seven clans composed of fourteen families, including papain (C1), calpain (C2), ubiquitin hydrolases (C12 and C19), and metacaspases (C14), among others [4]. Importantly, representatives of CPs are responsible for the degradation of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, a substance involved in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protection by inhibiting the entry of the virus into monocytic cells, making trichomoniasis a facilitating agent for HIV acquisition [5]. MPs are hydrolases that require the presence of a metal to perform the cleavage of peptide bonds in the target substrates. In T. vaginalis, eight clans containing fourteen families have been described, including leishmanolisin (or gp63) peptidases (M8), FtsH endopeptidases (M41), and several families of aminopeptidases, such as P aminopeptidases (M24) [4]. In general, peptidases are ubiquitously found in living organisms and are responsible for several vital functions in microbial cells, including nutrition, proliferation, growth, differentiation, and signaling, as well as pathological functions such as adhesion events, escape, dissemination, and immunomodulation [6,7]. Moreover, the microhabitat has been shown to play a potential role in the selection of certain functions related to peptidases. Different peptidases in T. vaginalis have been identified in the parasite secretome, such as subtilisin serine peptidases (S8), papain-type CPs, and MPs of the families M8 and M24 [8]. According to Arroyo [9], 123 genes encoding MPs have been described in T. vaginalis. TvMP50 and TvGP63 are most known MPs in trichomonads, both contributing to host cell damage. TvMP50 is an immunogenic MP detected during trichomoniasis in serum samples from male patients. The activity of this enzyme is mediated by Zn2+, which is present in high levels in the male urogenital microenvironment, being considered part of the group of cytolytic effectors involved in the pathogenicity of T. vaginalis mediated by environmental conditions [10,11]. TvGP63 is a family of enzymes that has 48 members, of which 37 members are transmembrane proteins; its activity has been related to cytotoxicity to HeLa cell monolayers [12,13]. Considering the participation of peptidases in the pathogenesis and virulence of trichomoniasis, these enzymes stand out as promising targets for the development of new anti-T. vaginalis therapies. The compound 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione (phendione) has been the focus of several biological studies due to its favorable chemical and pharmacological versatility [14\u201316]. The antibacterial effects of phendione and its silver and copper derivatives have been reported against the widespread multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, revealing that elastase B (a metallo-type peptidase that is a well-known virulence factor of this pathogen) is a target of these metal-based complexes [14,17]. In addition, these complexes have displayed antiparasitic activity against protozoa such as Leishmania amazonensis, Leishmania braziliensis, Leishmania chagasi, and T. vaginalis [16,18,19]. Interestingly, the interaction of copper(II) and silver(I)-phendione compounds with MPs have been described as key target in its antiparasitic activity [16]. In this context, phendionebased compounds were able to inhibit the main metallopeptidase activity (gp63) produced by L. brasiliensis promastigotes, affecting either the infection establishment or infection maintenance processes between parasites and macrophages [16]. Moreover, Cu-phendione induced several impacts on metabolic activity and membrane potential parameters of these Leishmania species [19]. Similarly, our group previously demonstrated the potent action of phendione and its silver and copper complexes against T. vaginalis, especially the copper\nPathogens 2023, 12, 745 3 of 18\nderivative (Cu-phendione), which presented values of minimum inhibitory concentration comparable to metronidazole, a common drug used in clinical therapy [18]. Furthermore, Cu-phendione and metronidazole acted synergistically in order to more effectively kill T. vaginalis trophozoites [18]. In addition, we showed that Cu-phendione killed T. vaginalis through redox homeostasis imbalance and apoptosis, a mode of action that is quite distinct from that caused by metronidazole [20]. Considering the promising contribution of phendione and its silver and copper derivatives in the prospection of therapeutic alternatives against trichomoniasis, as well as the interaction of these compounds with MPs produced by clinically relevant parasites, in the present study we investigated the effect of phendione and its metal-based complexes against T. vaginalis peptidases. Through evaluation of enzyme function and gene expression, significant disturbance in the proteolytic pathway was observed after parasite treatment with Cu-phendione. These data were corroborated by in silico approaches using TvMP50 and TvGP63 as T. vaginalis MP models. Finally, a cytoprotective effect was observed during the interaction process between T. vaginalis and both vaginal and renal epithelial cells induced by Cu-phendione treatment."

Threedimensional models of the enzymes were constructed using Alphafold, as represented in\nFigures 1\u20134 (with the aim of evaluating the interaction of the compounds with MPs. The calculated structures have high prediction levels, with pIDDT (Local Distance Difference Test) results greater than 90% (Figure 1A) and 60% (Figure 2A). This test evaluates how well the environment of a reference structure is reproduced in a protein model by calculating the pairs of atoms in the former and the corresponding distance in the latter [32]. The structure of the modeled TvMP50 was submitted to active site identification analysis using Discovery Studio Visualizer v21. Prior to protein characterization analysis, its structure was protonated at pH 6.0 in order to mimic the characteristics of the enzyme in an in vitro environment. As shown in Figures 1B and 2B, it was possible to identify the enzymatic catalytic site (ECS), represented in green. For TvMP50, the ECS was composed of three histidine residues at positions 215, 324, and 335. The amino acids found in the catalytic triad of the model obtained herein were in accordance with the description referring to the family of MP M24 [33]. At the ECS of TvGP63, a glutamic acid residue on position 208 and two histidine residues at positions 207 and 211 can be observed. Furthermore, it was possible to observe a difference in protonation of the enzyme with the increase in pH. As expected, titrable amino acids can change the load according to the alkalinization of the medium; however, the coupling capacity of the tested molecules did not change, demonstrating that pH change did not affect the inhibiting action of the test molecules. This result has great relevance, as the dysbiosis caused by the presence of pathogens in the vaginal environment is characterized by pH changes within the range evaluated in this experimental approach.\nSubsequently, the interactions between the test compounds and the T. vaginalis MPs were investigated by molecular docking analysis. The results revealed that all compounds were able to bind to the active sites of both TvMP50 and TvGP63 MPs (Figure 3, Tables 2 and 3). For TvMP50, Cu-phendione displayed the highest binding affinity (\u22129.7 kcal\u00b7mol\u22121), followed by Ag-phendione (\u22128.8 kcal\u00b7mol\u22121) and phendione (\u22126.1 kcal\u00b7mol\u22121).

            "text": "Considering the interaction of Cu-phendione with the main trichomonad MPs, the effect of this compound in the enzymatic profile was evaluated further. Azocasein is one of the most reliable substrates for measuring proteolytic activity, as it has good color stability and no need for chromogenic reagents [34]. The same methodology used to characterize T. vaginalis peptidases has been used to evaluate the trichomonacidal effects of compounds such as 2,4-diamine-quinazoline derivative [27,35]. As shown in Figure 5A, trophozoites treated with Cu-phendione had a significant reduction (77.14%) in their ability to degrade the casein substrate compared to untreated parasite cells, demonstrating an important inhibitory effect on the peptidase pool. In order to determine the effect of Cu-phendione on different peptidase classes produced by T. vaginalis, two fluorogenic peptide substrates were used; Phe-Arg was used to evidence the enzymatic activity of CPs, while MMP was used to measure MPs. As shown in Figure 5B,C, trophozoites treated with Cu-phendione showed a significant reduction in the ability to cleave both peptide substrates, suggesting impairment in the biological functions of these peptidases. An extensive review by Arroyo et al. [9] highlighted the main virulence properties related to CPs, such as cytoskeleton disruption, hemolysis, cytotoxicity,\ncytoadhesion, immunoglobulin degradation, and induction of host cell apoptosis.

The significant reduction of MMP cleavage observed with Cu-phendione was comparable to 1,10-phenanthroline, a well-known MP inhibitor. Studies have already linked the action of Cu-phendione with inhibition of metallo-type enzymes from different clinically relevant microorganisms. Multifunctional elastase B, described as LasB, is an MP from Pseudomonas aeruginosa responsible for the degradation of extracellular matrix constituents, potentially leading to tissue injury. Galdino et al. [17] demonstrated that Cu-phendione can interact with the catalytic site of LasB, significantly inhibiting its enzymatic activity.

As shown in Figure 5B,C, trophozoites treated with Cu-phendione showed a significant reduction in the ability to cleave both peptide substrates, suggesting impairment in the biological functions of these peptidases. An extensive review by Arroyo et al. [9] highlighted the main virulence properties related to CPs, such as cytoskeleton disruption, hemolysis, cytotoxicity, cytoadhesion, immunoglobulin degradation, and induction of host cell apoptosis. MPs are related to pathogenesis of T. vaginalis due to the cytotoxic action of these enzymes against host cells, in addition to the immunogenic activity found in the serum of male patients [10,12,36].\nThe significant reduction of MMP cleavage observed with Cu-phendione was comparable to 1,10-phenanthroline, a well-known MP inhibitor. Studies have already linked the action of Cu-phendione with inhibition of metallo-type enzymes from different clinically relevant microorganisms. Multifunctional elastase B, described as LasB, is an MP from Pseudomonas aeruginosa responsible for the degradation of extracellular matrix constituents, potentially leading to tissue injury. Galdino et al. [17] demonstrated that Cuphendione can interact with the catalytic site of LasB, significantly inhibiting its enzymatic activity. Moreover, MP from Leishmania spp. proved to be a target of Cu-phendione, reducing both membrane-associated and secreted MP activities, with direct impacts on the establishment and maintenance of infection [19]. These results demonstrate an imperative effect of Cu-phendione on cellular homeostasis considering the different functions and MPs enrolled in the protozoal metabolism, leading to in-depth investigation of peptidases targeted by this compound.\n3.3.

In addition, the same study demonstrated that this MP is secreted in its active form and that both forms, secreted and endogenous, exert cytotoxicity against prostate cells, being considered a cytolytic effector involved in the pathogenesis of T. vaginalis [10]. In addition, the other MP investigated in this study, TvGP63, is representative of the M8 family. It is described as a zinc-dependent MP, and is not affected by classical inhibitors such as EDTA and phosphoramidon, while 1,10-phenanthroline is active against this MP [3]. Another study described 48 members of TvGP63 family in T. vaginalis and separated them into three main groups, -a/-b/-c, with amino acids preserved at position 81 and at positions 515 and 90, and amino acids highly conserved in 75% of TvGP63 sequences. The localization of TVAG_367130 was described in the plasma membrane, which has great relevance in cytotoxicity processes against cellular hosts [12]. In addition, the occurrence of the GP63 gene in T. vaginalis has been demonstrated and referenced according to GenBank access number GU356538.1, demonstrating that MP acts in the cleavage of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) of the host cell [13]."

            "text": "Considering the importance of peptidases for T. vaginalis cytotoxicity, a cytolysis assay was performed to evaluate whether the pretreatment of trophozoites with Cu-phendione would have any effect in this virulence process. As demonstrated in Table 6, even 2 h of treatment with Cu-phendione was enough to lead to a significant reduction in parasitemediated cytotoxicity, as observed in both clinical fresh and ATCC reference T. vaginalis isolates. In addition, the reduction of cytolysis after Cu-phendione treatment was registered by microscopy of all tested isolates and both mammalian cell lineages (HMVII and VERO) (Supplementary Material, Figures S1 and S2). These results demonstrate that the presence of Cu-phendione can modulate the virulence of T. vaginalis.\nPathogens 2023, 12, 745 15 of 18\na ATCC 30236, TVLAC-M22, TVLAC-M15 and TV-LAC-H4 isolates treated or not with Cu-phendione (CPh). The data were expressed as a percentage of total lysis, considering Triton X-100 treatment as positive control (100% of LDH release). The data were analyzed by Student\u2019s t-test, where (*) p < 0.05.\nThe T. vaginalis peptidases participate in several virulence processes against the host, which may vary according to more or less virulent phenotypic isolates. Heterogeneity cytolysis of human vaginal epithelial cells has been determined in different T. vaginalis isolates [42]. Arroyo et al. highlighted several virulence properties from CPs, and demonstrated that the cytoadherence and cytotoxicity processes present different levels among T. vaginalis isolates, as well as distinct proteolytic activity observed in zymogram profiles [9]. Despite being a complex process that involves the modulation of several pathways of the parasite, the key role of different peptidases in mediating the cytotoxicity process has been increasingly described in the literature. TvCP65 is involved in trichomonad host cellular damage through regulation, probably in the transcriptional and translational levels, with a direct link to the polyamine metabolism [43]. TvCP39 is a glycosylated CP located on the surface the parasite involved in trichomonad cytotoxicity [44]. In addition, MPs have been described as virulence factors. TvMP50 was identified in the cytoplasm and secretion products of trophozoites treated with zinc, and cytotoxicity toward prostatic DU145 cell monolayers was demonstrated [10]. The capacity of lucidin-\u03c9-isopropyl ether to reduce the cytotoxicity of T. vaginalis against HeLa was related to the inhibition of TvMP50 proteolytic activity at the genetic level [45]. In this sense, the inhibition of peptidases by the compound investigated in the present study demonstrates a new option for development of novel anti-T. vaginalis agents."

            "text": "Recently, our group demonstrated the effect of Cu-phendione in the oxidative metabolism of T. vaginalis due to the decreased function and gene expression of enzymes responsible for detoxification, leading to homeostasis imbalance. Moreover, the Cu-phendione complex led to parasite death by activating an apoptosis-like cell death pathway [20]. Data obtained in the present study suggest that these peptidases are not directly involved in the activation of apoptotic pathways; instead, the multiple targets of Cu-phendione can lead to disturbances in the proteolytic metabolism of the parasite. Moreover, while the compound causes the death of T. vaginalis trophozoites by disturbance of the oxidative and proteolytic metabolism, it additionally causes reduced toxic effects against human cells. Indeed, in the scenario where microorganisms are constantly adapting to develop new resistance mechanisms, the presence of a molecule that is able to alter parasite homeostasis by different pathways has a greater ability to circumvent the selective pressure caused by therapy. In this sense, Cu-phendione stands out as a potent antiparasitic molecule able to act in peptidases, with important inhibition capability against T. vaginalis MPs.\nPathogens 2023, 12, 745 16 of 18\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/pathogens12050745/s1, Table S1: Proteins (166) identified by mass spectrometry after zymogram; Figure S1: Light microscopy of cytolysis assay with HMVII lineage after copper-phendione-treated Trichomonas vaginalis isolates ATCC 30236, TV-LACH4, TV-LACM15, TV-LACM22.
