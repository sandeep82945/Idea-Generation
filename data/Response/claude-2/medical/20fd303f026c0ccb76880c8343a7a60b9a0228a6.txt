 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the findings and limitations of this paper:

1. Conduct a larger, multi-center study to validate the findings of increased synchronous advanced adenomas in early-onset colon cancer but not rectal cancer. This could provide stronger evidence for biological differences by primary tumor site.

2. Perform more comprehensive germline genetic testing on patients with early-onset CRC and advanced adenomas to determine if certain genetic variants may predispose to the development of synchronous neoplasms.

3. Evaluate other molecular features of synchronous advanced adenomas compared to solitary advanced adenomas, such as DNA methylation patterns, to assess for evidence of field cancerization. 

4. Prospectively follow patients with early-onset CRC and synchronous advanced adenomas to assess their risk of developing metachronous neoplasms over time compared to those without advanced adenomas.

5. Study the gut microbiome of patients with early-onset colon cancer versus rectal cancer to determine if differences in microbial composition correlate with variations in synchronous neoplasia.
