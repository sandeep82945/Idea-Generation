His PhD dissertation on \u201cStochastic evolution equations\" developed further the Pardoux-Krylov-Rozovskii theory of SPDEs. He defended it in front of a committee chaired by A. N. Kolmogorov in 1981.\nAfter his PhD studies he continued working in the Department of Algebra and Number Theory, and then in the Department of Probability and Statistics at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University.\nHis mathematical development was helped greatly by the Humboldt Fellowship in the Goethe University Frankfurt (1984-85), the Keldysh Fellowship in the Steklov Mathematical Institute Moscow (1987-88), by the invited professorship at the University of Provence (Marseilles 1991-92), the visiting professorship at the University of Barcelona (1993-95), and by visiting positions at Carlton University Ottawa, at ETH Z\u00fcrich, at the University of Minnesota, the University of Melbourne, the University of Paris X, the University of Paris I and at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9riore de Rennes.\nSince 1995 he works in the School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh, teaching various courses in mathematics and mathematical finance.\nProfessor I. Gy\u00f6ngy is a very active researcher in Probability Theory and its Applications. According to the MathSciNet his publications are cited 1585 times by 887 authors (as of June 2021). He was an invited speaker at more than sixty workshops/conferences. Not surprisingly this attracted to him talented students and he supervised ten PhD dissertations. Out of about 90 of his papers more than half are joint papers with many co-authors some with his students. In particular, this shows how valuable and desirable collaborator and supervisor he is.\nIn 2005 he was elected as a member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (Scottish Academy of Sciences).\nHe considers himself extremely lucky that he has had and has many great teachers, friends and colleagues and constant support of his fantastic family, wife Anna, and their children Istvan, Mikl\u00f3s, Anna and Thomas.\nPublisher\u2019s Note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations."
