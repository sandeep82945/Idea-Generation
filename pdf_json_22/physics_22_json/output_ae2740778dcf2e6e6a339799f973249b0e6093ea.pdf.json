INTRODUCTION\nTime-series analysis, modeling, and prediction are ubiquitous tasks in applied sciences. When the time-series stem from ergodic dynamical systems, learning their phase space in a nonparametric fashion from sufficiently long intervals of observations is possible and has become an active field of research in recent years. This so-called data-driven approach seeks to obtain meaningful, physics-related knowledge, in an equation-free manner, shifting the focus from equations-based descriptions to observations-based analysis.1\u20136 Existing data-driven methods can be largely divided into two categories.7 The first is based on a state-space representation, and the focus is typically on finding a map that propagates a state at a given time to a state at a future time. Arguably, the classical approach\nChaos 32, 123127 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0123101 32, 123127-1\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n19 January 2024 01:59:24\nis to approximate the nonlinear dynamics as a collection of locally linear systems on tangent spaces near attractors.8\u201310 Another more recent class of methods in this category constructs reduced models of the state space in Euclidean spaces and then finds the propagation rules in the reduced spaces.1,11\u201313\nThe second category is an operator-theoretic approach that considers observables of the system. In this approach, many recent methods are based on the Koopman operator,14 which is a linear, infinite-dimensional operator that operates on observables in a Hilbert space and propagates them linearly in time.15,16 While the ability to represent nonlinear dynamics in a linear fashion is perhaps the most notable property of using the Koopman operator, it has several other remarkable attributes. In this line of work,7,15,17\u201319 it was shown that the Koopman operator has the ability of capturing the dynamics of linear or nonlinear dynamical systems through its spectral components. More concretely, the time evolution of a dynamical system can be decomposed into spatial patterns, which are often referred to as the Koopman modes and derived from the eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator, and temporal patterns, which are derived from the eigenvalues of the Koopman operator. Therefore, the spectral analysis of the Koopman operator is of high importance for obtaining an informative description of dynamical systems.7,17,18,20\u201322\nUsing the Koopman operator for analysis poses an important trade-off. On the one hand, it facilitates a linear description of the dynamics and a useful decoupling of the spatial and temporal patterns via its spectral representation. On the other hand, the Koopman operator is infinite dimensional. Therefore, finitedimensional approximations are necessary for practical purposes. Perhaps, the most common technique for such a finite approximation is the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), introduced by Schmid and Sesterhenn,23,24 where the primary goal is to approximate the Koopman eigenvalues and modes in finite spaces based on a finite set of observations.25 The DMD eigenvalues and modes give rise to a discrete spatiotemporal representation of the dynamical system, facilitating a data-driven and equation-free analysis. Following its appearance, several variants for enhancing the capabilities of DMD have been introduced, e.g., the extended DMD (EDMD),26 where projections on finite-space dictionaries were used to improve the spatiotemporal representation, least-squares,27,28 and sparsity promoting29,30 techniques, as well as approaches for the analysis of compressed data.31,32 Additional extensions of DMD have been introduced, such as multiresolution DMD (mrDMD),33 which effectively uncovers multiscale structures in the data, and DMD with control (DMDc),34 which extracts low-order models of high-dimensional systems that require control.\nIndeed, in recent years, DMD has been shown to be a powerful tool, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in a broad range of fields35\u201340 and, particularly, in fluid dynamics.25,41\u201347 Nevertheless, despite its popularity and success, DMD has some notable limitations. For example, a straightforward application of DMD does not allow for the signal reconstruction of a standing wave.16,48 In addition, ordinary DMD cannot handle cases when the number of linearly independent DMD modes is smaller than the number of the system\u2019s oscillation frequencies.49 Another notable limitation of DMD concerns one-dimensional signals, which are the output of an abundance of sensors, such as thermocouples,50 force sensors,51,52\nand magnetic and acoustic emission sensors.53,54 The application of DMD to such signals results in a degenerate (scalar) representation.\nCombining delay-coordinates embedding and DMD mitigates these limitations.16,48,49 The delay-coordinates embedding (also referred to as time-delay embedding, or, simply, delay-coordinates) is a method for augmenting past observations to the present observation. This approach dates back to 1981 with the formulation of Takens\u2019 embedding theorem,55 according to which an attractor of a system can be reconstructed up to a diffeomorphism using delay embedding.\nVarious studies that associate delay-coordinates and DMDbased methods have been presented in recent years. For example, Le Clainche and Vega49 presented the higher order DMD (HODMD), a global linear method that is capable of uncovering a large number of frequencies of periodic and quasiperodic dynamical systems based on limited and noisy input data. Brunton et al. introduced the HAVOK analysis in terms of a Hankel matrix, which successfully represents highly nonlinear and chaotic systems using a linear model and intermittent forcing.35 Pan and Duraisamy provided the minimal required augmentation number for a perfect recovery of dynamical systems based on their Fourier spectrum.56 We note that combinations of delay-coordinates and Koopman operator-based methods have also been investigated.19,57,58\nIn this paper, we show that despite its prevalence, application of DMD to augmented data (i.e., delay-coordinates DMD) gives rise to a particular spectral structure that does not exist in ordinary DMD applications and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been studied in the existing literature. This structure comprises augmented DMD modes that embody temporal information, which is entangled with spatial information. We formulate and analyze this entanglement, and term it the spatiotemporal coupling in delay-coordinates DMD.\nBased on this spatiotemporal coupling, we propose a new approach for obtaining compact and reduced-order representations of dynamical systems from observations, where, similar to ordinary DMD, the spatial and temporal patterns are decoupled. Our approach includes solving an inherent challenge of delaycoordinates DMD, where the number of augmented DMD components is often larger than the number of intrinsic modes of the dynamical system. In such cases, the augmented DMD components can be divided into two subsets: those that describe the dynamical system, which we term true, and those that are a mere artifact of the augmentation, unrelated to the system, which we term spurious.\nBy relying on the difference in their spatiotemporal coupling, we distinguish between the true and spurious DMD components and present a method for selecting the true components. In contrast to ordinary DMD, our method is based on delay-coordinates DMD and is, therefore, capable of analyzing and representing a broader family of observations and signals. We demonstrate the spatiotemporal coupling and the effectiveness of our approach on various simulated dynamical systems.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section II briefly describes existing approaches for mode selection. Section III presents the problem formulation. In Sec. IV, we introduce the spatiotemporal coupling in delay-coordinates DMD in detail and reveal the specific relations within augmented DMD modes. Then, in Sec. V, we propose a new method for decoupling the spatial and temporal information, leading to the identification of the true augmented\nChaos 32, 123127 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0123101 32, 123127-2\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n19 January 2024 01:59:24\nDMD components and to a compact, reduced-order, and informative representation of the observations. For the purpose of illustration, in Sec. VI, we present the application of our method to a twomode sine signal. Finally, in Sec. VII, our method is demonstrated on various dynamical systems, outperforming the common method that relies on the amplitudes of the modes at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values."

            "text": "The identification of the dominant DMD components required for optimal, reduced-order representations of dynamical systems (which we term true) has been studied in wider contexts, beyond delay-coordinates DMD. Criteria and methods for such a purpose are usually referred to as mode selection, where we use the broader term DMD components selection. For instance, Rowley et al. ordered the DMD modes by their norms (amplitudes)25\u2014a method we term the maximal amplitudes method. The norms of the modes can be further weighted by the magnitudes of the corresponding eigenvalues to account for modes that have large norms yet decay rapidly, as suggested by Tu et al.48 Schmid et al. used a projection of the data sequence on the identified modes, whose coefficients indicate on the significance of the modes.59 Jovanovic\u0301 et al. introduced a sparsity-promoting approach using an addition of a penalty term of the DMD amplitudes, which regularizes the least-square deviation between the linear combination of DMD modes and the snapshots matrix.29 Tissot et al. proposed an energetic criterion, where the amplitude of a DMD mode is weighted by its corresponding temporal coefficient.60 Sayadi et al. proposed a parameterized approach, which utilizes the sparsity promoting DMD, and then reconstructs the modes\u2019 amplitudes using a time-dependent coefficient, giving a notion of their significance.30 Another approach was proposed by Kou and Zhang, which considered the initial conditions and temporal evolution of DMD modes, ordering them according to the integrals of their corresponding time coefficients.61\nOur work differs from the above studies on mode selection, as it provides, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, a mode selection framework in the specific context of delaycoordinates DMD. Seemingly, the problem of mode selection in delay-coordinates DMD is more challenging due to the existence of spurious DMD modes, as well as the higher dimensions of augmented DMD modes compared to the observations. Nevertheless, we show that despite the additional challenges, delay-coordinates DMD also constitutes a remedy. Specifically, we show that the spatiotemporal coupling in delay-coordinates DMD bears information that facilitates a new method for mode selection."

Recalling that r\u0302 = rank(X\u0302) \u2264 min (n(s + 1), m \u2212 s), fulfillment of r\u0302 \u2265 r depends on the choice of s.

We term each column of 8\u0302 (0) or 8\u0302 (1)\nas a DMD sub-mode or, simply, sub-mode. Considering only the top n entries in Eq. (24) yields\nxk = 8\u0302 (0) c\u0302k. (25)\nOn the one hand, Eq. (25) shows that xk can be expressed by\nthe r\u0302 columns of 8\u0302 (0)\n. On the other hand, according to (9), it can be represented using only the r \u2264 r\u0302 columns of 8. Therefore, Eq.

By applying similar considerations to the bottom n entries in (24), the same conjecture can be made for xk+1 and 8\u0302 (1)\n. In the following assumption, we make these conjectures more precise. We note that this assumption is supported by an empirical verification in Sec.

Assume that the matrix 8\u0302 (j)\ntrue has full column rank r and that its column space spans the space of observations {xk}.\nIn other words, we assume that the r leftmost columns of 8\u0302 (0) are the ones required for the compact reduced-ordered representation of xk (hence, true), while the rest r\u0302 \u2212 r columns are redundant (hence, spurious). According to (9) and by Assumption 1, implying that the columns of 8\u0302 (0)\ntrue are linearly independent, xk can be rep-\nresented using only the r true columns of 8\u0302 (0)\nand their respective eigenvalues.\nNow, consider x\u0302k+1 \u2208 R2n, which for s = 1 is x\u0302k+1 = [xk+1, xk+2]\nT.

(30)\nFor distinct DMD eigenvalues, the rank of V\u0302 m\u2212s and (\u03bb\u03021, . . . , \u03bb\u0302r) is min(r, m \u2212 s).56 Since r \u2264 m \u2212 s [see Eq.

For a non-trivial representation of the dynamical system, i.e., \u03b7\u03020,l 6= 0, l = 1, . . . r, we have that rank ( \u03b7\u03020 )\n= r. Consequently, rank(C\u0302) = r.\nFor convenience, we define 1 = 8\u0302(1)true \u2212 8\u0302 (0) true3\u0302true. As the columns of C\u0302 are in the subspace of the solutions to Eq.

By the rank-nullity theorem, the rank of the matrix 1 equals to the matrix\u2019s number of columns r minus the dimension of its null space, i.e., dim ( ker (1) )\n= r. Therefore, rank (1) = 0, implying that1 = 0. Hence, 8\u0302(1)true = 8\u0302 (0)\ntrue3\u0302true, yielding Eq. (29).\nDenote the columns of 8\u0302 (0) true and 8\u0302 (1) true by \u03c6\u0302 (0) l and \u03c6\u0302 (1) l , respec-\ntively.

(35) and Fig. 1(b)]. We refer to these relations as the spatiotemporal coupling in delay-coordinates DMD. That is, an augmented DMD mode holds temporal information in addition to the spatial information. In addition, we show empirically in Sec. VI that the spurious components do not have this coupling.

            "text": "Based on the spatiotemporal coupling in delay-coordinates DMD presented in Proposition 4, we propose a method for obtaining a compact and reduced-order representation of the observations that is analogous to Eq. (8). As discussed in Sec. IV, representation (8) cannot be directly obtained from applications of DMD algorithms to delay-coordinates embedding due to two challenges: (a) the possible existence of both true and spurious augmented DMD components and (b) the existence of redundant sub-modes comprising every augmented DMD mode, which are unnecessary for the representation. Both challenges must be addressed to obtain the desired compact representation, i.e., the selection of the true augmented DMD modes, followed by the selection of the relevant sub-modes within the true modes.\nTo the best of our knowledge, challenge (a) is not addressed in the current literature in the context of delay-coordinates DMD. In the more general context of the Koopman operator, Pan et al. suggested a framework, which is based on multi-task feature learning, for the extraction of the most informative Koopman-invariant components and the pruning of the redundant components by penalizing departure from linear evolution.21 A common practice to address challenge (b) is to choose the first n entries in each selected augmented DMD mode, ignoring its spatiotemporal coupling. Therefore, we propose a method that considers the spatiotemporal coupling in Proposition 4 and selects the DMD components\nFIG. 6. The absolute errors, \u03b5l , between the averaged eigenvalues \u3008\u03bb\u0303l\u3009 in Eq. (42) and their corresponding DMD eigenvalues, \u03bb\u0302l [see Eq. (43)]. The true eigenvalues, \u03bb\u03021, . . . , \u03bb\u03024 are marked by blue circles, and the spurious eigenvalues, \u03bb\u03025, . . . , \u03bb\u030212, are marked by red crosses. The absolute errors of the spurious\n\u03bb\u0302l are larger by at least 10 orders of magnitude than those of the true \u03bb\u0302l , providing a clear distinction between the true and spurious DMD eigenvalues. The markings of the blue circles and red crosses were obtained in a unsupervised manner using Algorithm 1.\nrequired for compact representations of dynamical systems. Our method is detailed in this section and summarized in Algorithm 1. An empirical comparison between our method and the maximal amplitudes method is conducted in Sec. VII, where the superiority of our method is demonstrated in case the observations are corrupted with high levels of noise.\nOur method begins by augmenting the observations s times, and applying the exact DMD to them. Generally, the augmentation number s can be chosen either in the range prescribed in (19) or in\nALGORITHM 1. Proposed algorithm.\nInput: Observations {xk}mk=0 of a dynamical system. Output: Compact and reduced-order spectral representation of the observations.\n1. Augment the data s times according to the range in (20), apply the exact DMD algorithm to the augmented observations, and extract the\naugmented DMD eigenvalue-mode pairs, \u03bb\u0302l and \u03c6\u0302 l, respectively.\n2. Calculate the oscillations frequencies \u03c9l that correspond to each augmented DMD eigenvalue \u03bb\u0302l using Eq. (13). 3. Compute the bound B(\u03c9l) in Eq. (40) for each \u03c9l. 4. Compute the averaged eigenvalues \u3008\u03bb\u0303l\u3009 by Eq. (42). 5. Calculate the absolute errors, \u03b5l, between the averaged computed eigenvalues, \u3008\u03bb\u0303l\u3009, and their corresponding (non-averaged) DMD\neigenvalues, \u03bb\u0302l, as in Eq. (43). 6. Partition \u03b5l into two subsets using k-means with k = 2, and compute the average values of each subset, as in (44). Select the averaged\neigenvalues (and their corresponding modes) related to the subset corresponding to the smaller average value. 7. Use the selected DMD components for building a compact and reduced-order spectral representation of the observations, according\nto Eq. (46).\nChaos 32, 123127 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0123101 32, 123127-9\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n19 January 2024 01:59:24\n(20). Yet, the empirical evidence presented in Sec. VII shows that s should be chosen according to (20). Next, the DMD eigenvalue-\nmode pairs, \u03bb\u0302l and \u03c6\u0302 l, respectively, are extracted, followed by a calculation of the oscillation frequencies \u03c9l by (13), as well as the bounds B(\u03c9l) that correspond to each \u03c9l by (40).\nTo identify the true components out of all the obtained DMD components, we propose to utilize Eq. (37), where the identification proceeds as follows. The same eigenvalue \u03bb\u0303l is repeatedly computed via substitution of different i and j values in Eq. (37). For example, by setting i = 0 and j = 1, . . . , B(\u03c9l), the eigenvalue \u03bb\u0303l can be computed multiple times by taking the quotients of the sub-modes as\n\u03bb\u0303 (j) l = ( \u03c6\u0302 (j) l\n\u03c6\u0302 (0) l\n) 1 j\n, j = 1, . . . , B(\u03c9l), (41)\nwhere a tilde denotes a computed entity and the superscripted index (j) in \u03bb\u0303 (j)\nl denotes the jth computation of this eigenvalue. As stated in Proposition 4, the spatiotemporal coupling in delay-coordinates DMD holds only for true DMD components. Hence, any jth computation of any lth true eigenvalue according to (41) yields the same value (in a noise-free system). Moreover, this value is identical to\nthe DMD eigenvalue, i.e., \u03bb\u0303 (j) l = \u03bb\u0302l, for l = 1, . . . , r. Conversely, such computations of spurious DMD eigenvalues, for l = r + 1, . . . , r\u0302, are expected to yield different computed results upon substitution of\nvarying values of j in (41), as well as results that differ from \u03bb\u0302l. Therefore, (41) contains information that enables the distinction between true and spurious DMD components.\nIn the presence of observation noise, the identification of true DMD components through (41) can be enhanced by introducing an averaged computed eigenvalue, \u3008\u03bb\u0303l\u3009, e.g., as\n\u3008\u03bb\u0303l\u3009 = 1\nB(\u03c9l)\nB(\u03c9l) \u2211\nj=1 \u03bb\u0303\n(j) l . (42)\nIn case \u03c9l > 0.5\u03c9s, then B(\u03c9l) = 0. This scenario can occur, e.g., when s is chosen to be very large, which, in turn, might produce a very large \u03c9l. Since the sampling rate admits the Nyquist\u2013Shannon sampling criterion for the true oscillation frequencies, such \u03c9l must be related to a spurious eigenvalue. Therefore, when B(\u03c9l) = 0, we consider the eigenvalue corresponding to \u03c9l as spurious and remove it from the computation in (42).\n\u03031 computed based on our and the maximal amplitudes methods, respectively. The whiskers denote the 25th and 75th percentiles of 1.\nChaos 32, 123127 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0123101 32, 123127-10\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\nA noteworthy drawback of DMD is its sensitivity to observation noise.41,65 Different approaches, which are more sophisticated than Eq. (42), tackled this issue. For example, noise-corrected DMD, forward-backward DMD, total least-squares methods,28,66 and variational formulations,67 to name but a few. Overall, the sensitivity of DMD to noise-corrupted data still remains an open problem.68\nThereafter, the absolute errors, \u03b5l, are calculated by\n\u03b5l = \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u3008\u03bb\u0303l\u3009 \u2212 \u03bb\u0302l \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 , (43)\nproviding an estimation for the difference between the augmented DMD eigenvalue and the average of the eigenvalues computed based on the spatiotemporal coupling in Proposition 4. Alternatively, the absolute errors can be defined as the average of the absolute differences between computed eigenvalues \u03bb\u0303 (j)\nl and their corresponding\nDMD eigenvalue \u03bb\u0302l. We note that this definition yields similar empirical results in the applications studied in this paper.\nIf the computed eigenvalues \u03bb\u0303 (j) l for j = 1, . . . , B(\u03c9l) are different from \u03bb\u0302l, then \u03b5l in Eq. (43) is large, which means that \u03bb\u0302l is spurious. Contrarily, if \u03bb\u0303 (j)\nl are approximately equal to \u03bb\u0302l, then \u03b5l is\nsmall, indicating that \u03bb\u0302l is true. Therefore, \u03b5l, l = 1, . . . , r\u0302, can be\npartitioned into two subsets, S1 and S2. Without loss of generality, assume that S1 constitutes the first d values of \u03b5l, i.e., {\u03b51, . . . , \u03b5d} \u2208 S1, where 1 \u2264 d \u2264 r\u0302, and that S2 contains the remaining r\u0302 \u2212 d values, {\u03b5d+1, . . . , \u03b5r\u0302} \u2208 S2. This partitioning can be carried out by applying standard clustering algorithms to \u03b5l, e.g., k-means with k = 2.\nWe choose the k-means algorithm because, on the one hand, it is widely used, easy to implement, and does not assume any statistical model as a prior, and one the other hand, it is a centroid-based clustering algorithm. Namely, it is suitable to perform the task of separating two types of data points clustered around two centroids that are related to the true and spurious DMD components.\nAfter clustering, the average absolute errors of subsets S1 and S2, \u3008\u03b5\u3009S1 and \u3008\u03b5\u3009S2 are computed as\n\u3008\u03b5\u3009S1 = 1\nd\nd \u2211 l=1 \u03b5l, \u3008\u03b5\u3009S2 = 1 r\u0302 \u2212 d\nr\u0302\u2212d \u2211 l=1 \u03b5l, (44)\nand then, the smaller of \u3008\u03b5\u3009S1 and \u3008\u03b5\u3009S2 denotes the subset that contains the \u03b5l related to the true DMD eigenvalues. The distinction between small and large absolute errors was straightforward in the\n\u03032 computed based on our and the maximal amplitudes methods, respectively. The whiskers denote the 25th and 75th percentiles of 2.\nChaos 32, 123127 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0123101 32, 123127-11\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\nillustrative example (see Sec. VI, Fig. 6). We note that in case the values of \u03b5l that are related to the two types of components (true and spurious) are small and relatively close to each other, the input of the k-means algorithm can be scaled, e.g., by considering log10(\u03b5l) rather than \u03b5l; this scaling enhances the difference between the two types and alleviates their distinction via the k-means algorithm.\nIn some cases, the DMD components of dynamical systems arise in complex conjugate pairs. In such cases, each complex conjugate pair represents the same characteristics of the system (e.g., the same oscillation frequencies \u03c9l). These pairs embody another degree of redundancy, which can be exploited, for example, as follows.\nDenote \u03bb\u0302q as the complex conjugate of \u03bb\u0302l. Then, similarly to (42), an averaged eigenvalue \u3008\u03bb\u0303l,q\u3009, which accounts for this redundancy, can be written as\n\u3008\u03bb\u0303l,q\u3009 = 1\n2\n( \u3008\u03bb\u0303l\u3009 + \u3008\u03bb\u0303q\u3009 ) , (45)\nwhere an overline denotes a complex conjugate. As \u3008\u03bb\u0303l,q\u3009 is computed over both l and q, the influence of noise on the observations can be further diminished in these systems.\nLastly, once the subset of the true augmented DMD components is identified using Eq. (44), the observations can be represented analogously to (8) as\nxk = |S1| \u2211\nl=1 \u3008\u03bb\u0303l\u3009k\u03c6\u0302\n(0) l \u03c3\u03020,l, (46)\nwhere \u03c3\u03020,l = \u3008\u03c6\u0302 l, x\u03020\u3009, |S1| is the cardinality of S1, and, without loss of generality, we assume that S1 is the subset that contains the \u03b5l values related to the true DMD eigenvalues \u3008\u03bb\u0303l\u3009. We note that our method has two main shortcomings, which we plan to address in future research. First, compared to mode selection based on maximal amplitudes, our method is computationally heavier. Second, as shown in Sec. VII, our empirical study suggests that the performance is sensitive to the choice of the augmentation number s. We plan to develop a systematic procedure to set the augmentation number, as well as more efficient implementation schemes that mitigate the repeated computation of eigenvalue decomposition. Additional future work may include the demonstration of our method on nonlinear and chaotic dynamical systems, as well as on real-life measurements.\nChaos 32, 123127 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0123101 32, 123127-12\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\nFIG. 10. Same as Fig. 8 but for \u03c92 of the quasiperiodic signal.\nVI. ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE\nBy following the proposed algorithm (Algorithm 1) step by step, we demonstrate the spatiotemporal coupling in delaycoordinates DMD (formulated in Sec. IV) on an illustrative example of a two-mode sine signal. More specifically, we show how Proposition 4 facilitates the identification, in an equation-free manner, of the DMD components required for the representation and characterization of the signal. Evaluation is done by comparing the true signal\u2019s oscillation frequencies to the oscillation frequencies that correspond to the DMD eigenvalues selected by our method. Our method can also be visually evaluated through its signal reconstruction compared to the original signal, as shown in Fig. 3.\nConsider the following two-mode sine signal:\nx(t) = sin(\u03c9sys1 t) + sin(\u03c9 sys 2 t) + \u03b1n(t), (47)\nwhere \u03c9 sys 1 = 3 rad/s, \u03c9 sys 2 = 5 rad/s, n(t) is an additive white standard Gaussian noise, and \u03b1 = 10\u221212. Figure 2 shows a dynamical system whose coordinate x(t) can represent such a signal. Specifically, signal (47) can be viewed as the position of mass m1 in a two degrees of freedom (DOF) oscillator, comprised of two masses, m1 and m2, connected to each other via springs. We denote the\ncomponents that correspond to the system by the superscript sys, i.e., \u03c9\nsys 1 and \u03c9 sys 2 are the system\u2019s harmonics.\nThe signal is sampled at the sampling rate \u03c9s = 2\u03c0/1t = 20\u03c0 rad/s (corresponding to 10 Hz) and 101 samples (observations) {xk}100k=0 are collected, shown by the solid black line in Fig. 3.\nWe begin the illustration by augmenting the observations with s = 11. This choice of s is in accordance with the upper bound on s in (20), yet it does not adhere to the lower bound in the same equation. One of the main purposes of this section is to demonstrate\nk1 = k2 = 50 N/m, k3 = 75 N/m. The system is subjected to the initial conditions x1(0) = 1m, x2(0) = 2m, x3(0) = 3m, x\u03071(0) = x\u03072(0) = x\u03073(0) = 0, giving rise to its oscillations.\nChaos 32, 123127 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0123101 32, 123127-13\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n19 January 2024 01:59:24\nthat Proposition 4 holds for true DMD components and up to the bound B(\u03c9l). Consequently, we choose s = 11, which is a value that, on the one hand, demonstrates these two statements for system (47), and on the other hand, provides a small enough number of eigenvalues that can be conveniently visualized. That is, this choice is made merely for illustrative purposes.\nThe exact DMD algorithm is applied to the augmented observations, resulting in s + 1 = 12 augmented DMD eigenvalue-mode pairs, {\u03bb\u0302l, \u03c6\u0302l} 12\nl=1. Figure 4(a) presents the polar representation of \u03bb\u0302l, and Fig. 4(b) shows the oscillation frequencies, \u03c9l (corresponding to the eigenvalues by Eq. (13)), sorted in ascending order. It can be observed in Fig. 4(a) that the DMD eigenvalues of this signal arise in complex conjugate pairs. Moreover, these eigenvalues are distinct, satisfying the condition of Propositions 2 and 4.\nSince the signal is composed of two oscillation frequencies, \u03c9 sys 1 and \u03c9 sys 2 , two complex conjugate DMD eigenvalue pairs \u03bb\u03021,2 and \u03bb\u03023,4 are related to these frequencies\u2014these are the true eigenvalues and they are marked by blue circles in Fig. 4. Indeed, Fig. 4(b) corroborates them as true since they correspond to the frequencies 3 and 5 rad/s. Similarly, the remaining eight eigenvalues (and their corresponding modes) are spurious and are marked by red crosses in Fig. 4.\nOur goal of identifying the true DMD components required for the system description in an equation-free manner can be visually described via Fig. 4. Suppose the observations {xk}100k=0 were obtained from an unknown system, i.e., without the knowledge that 3 and 5 rad/s are the system\u2019s harmonics. Then, the markings of the blue circles and red crosses would be unknown as well. In this regard, our goal would be the task of identifying the blue circles, which represent the true DMD eigenvalues.\nBy Eq. (40), the bounds that correspond to the two system\u2019s harmonics are computed to be B(\u03c9\nsys 1 ) = 10 and B(\u03c9 sys 2 ) = 6. Next,\nwe demonstrate Proposition 4 by showing that the spatiotemporal coupling indeed holds up to these bounds. The choice of s = 11 is the minimal value of s that can serve this purpose. As an example,\nwe consider the true eigenvalues \u03bb\u03021 and \u03bb\u03023, as well as the spurious eigenvalue \u03bb\u03029. For each of them, we follow the eigenvalues computation in Eq. (41) eleven times; namely, we substitute j = 1, . . . , 11 for each of the three values l = 1, 3, 9 in Eq. (41). Figure 5 presents the polar representations of these computed eigenvalues.\nFigure 5(a) shows \u03bb\u0303(1)1 , . . . , \u03bb\u0303 (10) 1 as blue circles and \u03bb\u0303 (11) 1 as a blue dot. As expected and according to B(\u03c9 sys 1 ) = 10, the former 10 computed eigenvalues coincide with each other, and appear as a single circle in Fig. 5(a). Moreover, a comparison between them and\nChaos 32, 123127 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0123101 32, 123127-14\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\ntheir corresponding true DMD eigenvalue, \u03bb\u03021, reveals that \u03bb\u0303 (1) 1 = . . . = \u03bb\u0303(10)1 = \u03bb\u03021. Contrarily, the 11th computed eigenvalue, \u03bb\u0303(11)1 , differs from them, as expected, since its index exceeds the upper bound B(\u03c9\nsys 1 ) = 10. Similarly, Fig. 5(b) shows \u03bb\u0303(1)3 , . . . , \u03bb\u0303 (6) 3 as blue circles and\n\u03bb\u0303 (7) 3 , . . . , \u03bb\u0303 (11) 3 as blue dots. As B(\u03c9 sys 2 ) = 6, the former 6 computed eigenvalues coincide with each other and appear as a single circle in Fig. 5(b). Further comparison confirms that \u03bb\u0303(1)3 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = \u03bb\u0303(6)3 = \u03bb\u03023. On the other hand, \u03bb\u0303(7)3 6= \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 6= \u03bb\u0303(11)3 6= \u03bb\u03023. That is, relations (41) are indeed valid for true DMD components and up to B(\u03c9l).\nFinally, Fig. 5(c), which relates to the spurious DMD eigenvalue\n\u03bb\u03029, depicts the 11 computed eigenvalues \u03bb\u0303 (1) 9 , . . . , \u03bb\u0303 (11) 9 , which are different from each other. This difference indicates that \u03bb\u03029 is spurious, as relations (41) are not valid for spurious DMD components.\nTo conclude the demonstration in Fig. 5, we showed that only true DMD components adhere to the spatiotemporal coupling in delay-coordinates DMD in Proposition 4 and only up the bound B(\u03c9l) in Eq. (40).\nNext, we exploit this spatiotemporal coupling in order to identify the true DMD components required for compact representation of the dynamical system. Accordingly, we compute all the averaged\neigenvalues, \u3008\u03bb\u0303l\u3009, l = 1, . . . , 12, via Eq. (42), followed by a calculation of their absolute errors, \u03b5l, by Eq. (43). Figure 6 shows \u03b5l for each of the 12 eigenvalues in this illustrative example, where \u03bb\u03021, . . . , \u03bb\u03024 are the true eigenvalues marked by blue circles, and the rest are the spurious eigenvalues marked by red crosses. Evidently, the absolute\nerrors of \u03bb\u03021, . . . , \u03bb\u03024 are smaller by at least 10 orders of magnitude than the absolute errors of the spurious eigenvalues. Consequently, the true and spurious eigenvalues can be easily distinguished by visual inspection based on Fig. 6.\nTo implement this identification in an unsupervised fashion, \u03b5l are clustered into two subsets, S1 and S2, using the k-means algorithm with k = 2. The resulting clusters are {\u03b51, . . . , \u03b54} \u2208 S1 and {\u03b55, . . . , \u03b512} \u2208 S2. Next, the respective average absolute errors of S1 and S2 are computed, namely, \u3008\u03b5\u3009S1 and \u3008\u03b5\u3009S2 , according to (44). In this example, \u3008\u03b5\u3009S1 \u2248 10\u221215 and \u3008\u03b5\u3009S2 \u2248 10\u22123. Therefore, subset S1, corresponding to the smaller value \u3008\u03b5\u3009S1 < \u3008\u03b5\u3009S2 is identified as the subset containing the \u03b5l that are related to the true DMD eigenvalues.\nBased on this identification, the original (sampled) signal is reconstructed using Eq. (46). The accuracy of the reconstruction can be observed in Fig. 3, which shows the original (black solid line) and the reconstructed (blue dashed line) signals. We note that the\nChaos 32, 123127 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0123101 32, 123127-15\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\nmarkings of the blue circles and red crosses in Fig. 6, as well as the reconstructed signal in Fig. 3, were obtained in a completely unsupervised and automatic manner using Algorithm 1.\nTo conclude, we emphasize that the input of our algorithm is the samples (observations) of the system, where it operates in an equation-free and unsupervised fashion to, eventually, extract a reduced-order and optimal spectral representation of the system.\nThe code that reproduces the results in this section is openly available in the following GitHub link (https://github.com/emilbron stein/spatiotemporal_coupling_in_delay_coordinates_DMD)."

V and summarized in Algorithm 1) for the augmentation numbers s = 10, 20, . . . , 360 and compare its DMD components selection to the selection method based on maximal amplitudes. For comparison purposes, we focus on the accuracy of the recovery of the oscillation frequencies of the signal obtained\nby the two methods. For a fair comparison, we set the number of selected DMD components to 4 (2 oscillation frequencies that appear in 2 complex conjugate pairs correspond to 4 DMD eigenvalues). Note that, in general, our method does not require the number of DMD components as a prior, but infers it from the observations.\nThe recovery of the oscillation frequencies is evaluated by the absolute errors, i, between the system\u2019s true oscillation frequencies (\u03c9\nsys 1 and \u03c9 sys 2 ) and the frequencies obtained from the DMD eigenvalues that were selected based on our and the maximal amplitudes methods, denoted by the superscripts our and amp, respectively.

            "text": "Delay-coordinates DMD is widely used for data-driven analysis of dynamical systems based on observations in a broad range of fields. In this paper, we investigated two key questions concerning the inherent redundancy that arises from the utility of delay-coordinates DMD: the excess of dynamical components (i.e., spurious components) and the excess of dimensionality (i.e., coordinates). We showed that delay-coordinates DMD induces a particular\nstructure on the augmented DMD components, consisting of a spatiotemporal coupling. At first glance, this coupling seems to counter the core idea underlying DMD, which facilitates a representation of the system that decouples temporal and spatial patterns. Yet, a deeper look allowed us not only to mitigate this coupling, but also to exploit it. Based on the spatiotemporal coupling we presented, we proposed a method for constructing a compact and improved reduced-order DMD representation. Specifically, we showed how to identify and select the informative (true) DMD components, thereby addressing the excess of dynamical components. This identification is based on the induced temporal associations within each augmented mode, which allowed us to address the redundancy in dimensionality. We tested the proposed method on four dynamical systems corrupted with noise and compared the performance to the prevalent method, which is based on the maximal amplitudes of the DMD modes. The results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method and imply that exploiting the spatiotemporal structure becomes crucial at low SNR values (high levels of noise) and gives a significant advantage over the maximal amplitudes method, which is completely agnostic to it."
