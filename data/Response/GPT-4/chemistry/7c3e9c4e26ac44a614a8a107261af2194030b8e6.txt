Development of more soluble dirhodium(II,II) complexes and metallodendrimers: The paper highlights issues with solubility, particularly for the metallodendrimer complexes. Future research could focus on structural modifications to improve solubility in biological media, thereby potentially enhancing cytotoxic activity and facilitating more accurate selectivity studies against healthy non-tumorigenic cell lines.

Exploration of different ligand modifications: Given that the cytotoxicity of dirhodium(II,II) complexes was influenced by the presence of acetate and methyl-substituted formamidinate ligands, further research could explore the synthesis and evaluation of complexes with other ligand modifications. These modifications could aim to enhance cytotoxicity and selectivity towards cancer cells, potentially leading to compounds with improved therapeutic profiles.

Mechanistic studies of dirhodium(II,II) complex interactions with DNA and proteins: The paper suggests that dirhodium(II,II) complexes may bind covalently to DNA nucleotide bases and interact with biologically relevant enzymes. Future studies could delve deeper into these interactions at the molecular level, exploring the mechanisms of action to better understand how these complexes exert their cytotoxic effects and how they might be tailored to target cancer cells more effectively.

In vivo efficacy and toxicity studies: While the paper presents in vitro cytotoxicity data, there is a clear need for in vivo studies to assess the efficacy and general toxicity of these complexes in animal models. Such studies could provide valuable insights into the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and overall therapeutic potential of these compounds, including their ability to selectively target tumor tissue while minimizing harm to healthy cells.

Investigation of multidrug resistance (MDR) bypass strategies: The paper notes that certain dirhodium(II,II) complexes displayed increased cytotoxicity relative to cisplatin in cisplatin-resistant cell lines. Future research could focus on understanding and exploiting this property to develop strategies for bypassing or overcoming MDR mechanisms in cancer cells. This could involve studying the interactions of these complexes with MDR proteins and identifying structural features that contribute to their ability to evade drug resistance pathways.
