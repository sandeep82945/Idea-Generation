Comparative Studies Across Different Countries: This research could be expanded to include comparative studies of EWP across different countries, especially those undergoing rapid urbanization similar to China. This would help understand the global applicability of the EWP evaluation model and identify unique challenges and solutions across diverse economic, cultural, and environmental contexts.

Longitudinal Impact of Policy Interventions on EWP: Investigating the long-term effects of specific urban and environmental policies on the EWP of various regions. This research can help in understanding which policies are most effective in improving both the efficiency and effectiveness of ecological well-being performance over time.

Integration of Technology and Innovation in EWP Improvement: Exploring how advancements in technology and innovation can be integrated into the existing framework to improve EWP. This could involve the use of smart cities technologies, renewable energy sources, and innovative waste management solutions to enhance ecological efficiency and effectiveness.

Socio-Economic Factors Influencing EWP: Conducting in-depth studies to understand the socio-economic factors influencing EWP in urban settings. This research can delve into how income levels, education, and community engagement in environmental sustainability efforts affect the ecological and human development indices.

Adapting EWP Models for Rural Development: While the current study focuses on urban areas, there's a significant opportunity to adapt the EWP evaluation model for rural development. This research could explore how rural areas, with their unique ecological and social characteristics, can be evaluated for their ecological well-being performance, potentially guiding sustainable rural development strategies.
