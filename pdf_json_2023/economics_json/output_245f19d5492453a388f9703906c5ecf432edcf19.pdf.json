    "abstractText": "15 Since the introduction of the terms in the early 2000s, the land sharing versus land sparing 16 dichotomy has sparked considerable discussion stemming from the relationship between food 17 production and ecological function. The theory underpinning these approaches straddles 18 disciplinary and ideological boundaries and is frequently outlined within a general economy 19 versus ecology background. Both strategies have come up with competing models on the 20 relationship linking agricultural production and ecological function. 21 The present work introduces a conceptual synthesis to unify alternative models under a single 22 coherent framework. A generalized model linking agricultural production with ecological 23 function that can harmonize these conflicting views is presented. In addition, a conceptual 24 shift of paradigm is suggested to approach the issue, moving from yield targets to 25 preservation thresholds. 26 This article provides the theoretical means to identify the environmental and policy 27 conditions under which land sharing strategies, based on low inputs and low impact per unit 28 of cultivated land, can compete with land sparing approaches for the combined goals of 29 biodiversity preservation and food safety. 30",

The theory underpinning these approaches straddles 18 disciplinary and ideological boundaries and is frequently outlined within a general economy 19 versus ecology background. Both strategies have come up with competing models on the 20 relationship linking agricultural production and ecological function. 21 The present work introduces a conceptual synthesis to unify alternative models under a single 22 coherent framework. A generalized model linking agricultural production with ecological 23 function that can harmonize these conflicting views is presented. In addition, a conceptual 24 shift of paradigm is suggested to approach the issue, moving from yield targets to 25 preservation thresholds. 26 This article provides the theoretical means to identify the environmental and policy 27 conditions under which land sharing strategies, based on low inputs and low impact per unit 28 of cultivated land, can compete with land sparing approaches for the combined goals of 29 biodiversity preservation and food safety. 30"

            "text": "Over the last 20 years several disciplines have joined the debate around the trade-off between 32 agriculture and wildlife conservation. This debate is usually framed around the land 33 sparing/land sharing tag, where \u2018sparing\u2019 represents intensive high yielding agriculture on a 34 small area of productive land and \u2018sharing\u2019 requires wildlife friendly farming with lower 35 yields on a larger area of land. Opinions on the subject reflect a broad range of ideological 36 positions, and tend to cross disciplinary boundaries straddling from economic (Kremen, 37 2015; J.-M. Salles et al., 2017) to conservation (A. Balmford et al., 2015; Baudron & Giller, 38\n2014) through to developmental studies (Fischer et al., 2017). Recently, the impact of climate 39 change, increased energy costs, population growth and the need for more housing in many 40 countries are adding a new layer of complexity and a sense of urgency to this pivotal debate. 41 While many more trade-offs can be identified around agricultural production, spanning from 42 land ownership and environmental policy enforcement to allocation and distribution of 43 resources, the link between production and preservation of ecological function cannot be 44 circumvented and is the focus of the present work. 45\nThe role of conservation and low-intensity agriculture in global land use has often been 46 framed, perhaps starting with the pivotal article by Green et al. (2005) in a debate opposing 47 the two alternative frameworks of land sharing and land sparing. Organic and conservation 48 agriculture, together with other forms of agroecology, are considered as the keystone 49 techniques of the land sharing approach, which is based on the idea that a high level of 50 biodiversity and ecological function can be sustained on agricultural land. By contrast, 51 supporters of the land sparing paradigm argue that aiming for intensive, high-yield cultivation 52 is overall a biodiversity-friendlier approach since it allows production targets to be met using 53 a smaller surface area, therefore freeing large areas for minimally managed natural 54 ecosystems. Occasionally, land sparing is referred to as the Borlaug model, since one of the 55 underpinning objectives of the green revolution and of its chief proponent Norman Borlaug, 56 was to stop the encroachment of agriculture into surviving forests and natural grassland by 57 dramatically increasing production on smaller land areas (B. T. Phalan, 2018). Management 58 of landscape connectivity, which allows otherwise fragmented ecosystems to benefit from 59 ecological corridors favouring long-range migrations, gene flow and rapid recruitment after 60 disturbance, is also a key tenet of the land sparing approach, whereas it is deemed to be 61 largely superfluous under land sharing. While the two approaches are largely alternative in 62 their foundations and landscape-scale application, overlap and blurred borders can occur at a 63 smaller scale, where wild margins and fallow corridors can be part of the toolkit of either 64 approach (Gilroy et al., 2014; Grass et al., 2019; Hodgson et al., 2010). 65\nMost of the field and associated modelling data compiled so far point to an inherent 66 advantage of the land sparing approach (Phalan et al., 2014; Segre et al., 2022), but there are 67 dissenting studies (Steffan-Dewenter et al., 2007) and the issue should not be prematurely 68 considered as settled (Kremen, 2015). Others point to the fact that the optimal choice would 69 be context-dependent, with suggestions that land sharing might be more appropriate in 70 temperate regions and land sparing in tropical climates (Ramankutty & Rhemtulla, 2012). In 71 addition, advocates of land sharing claim that the yield gap between conservation and 72 industrial agriculture is not as large as portrayed, and that in the environmental budget of 73 intensive agriculture there are substantial negative externalities that are not taken into account 74 by most comparisons (Matson & Vitousek, 2006). Some authors also highlight the different 75 ethical frameworks underpinning the two strategies, with considerations other than a purely 76 scientific debate essential to assess the optimal choice (Loconto et al., 2020). Moreover, the 77 dichotomous nature of the debate has also been questioned, with a synthetic assessment of the 78 two philosophies pointing out that the global adoption of either of these techniques would be 79 an undesirable outcome for global biodiversity (Kremen, 2015). The criticism is based on the 80 limits of the reductionist approach that such a binary choice entails, and on the observation 81 that a combination of elements from the two alternatives would offer better perspectives 82 (Baudron et al., 2021). 83\nWhatever the ideological starting point, the trade-off between agricultural production and 84 ecological performance is well-documented and has wide-ranging consequences for global 85 land use and agricultural production. While many additional considerations can be made 86\nregarding the social, economic and political aspects of food production, the decision about 87 the optimal level of intensity in the exploitation of each individual parcel of land cannot be 88 avoided. The fundamental question \u201cto what extent can yield be sacrificed for environmental 89 benefits?\u201d lies at the heart of the dilemma. The monetisation of negative and positive 90 externalities \u2013 adverse or beneficial effects on the surrounding environment or local 91 communities- is now commonplace in agricultural policies (Pretty et al., 2001). However, if 92 the adoption of practices to reduce negative externalities or increase positive ones results in a 93 yield contraction, and if the production at a landscape scale must meet stable, or even 94 increasing needs, land managers will face a complex trade-off (Li et al., 2020). More 95 specifically, if the improvement in environmental quality following the adoption of the new 96 practices is quantitatively more than compensated for by the loss in environmental quality on 97 the additional land required to be put into production to maintain production targets, the 98 environmental balance would be negative. 99\n2. Production and ecological function: trade-offs and trajectories 100\nTo provide answers to this conundrum, a conceptual framework is required that links 101 production and ecological function. This is a necessary step, but it is fraught with possible 102 pitfalls when it comes to defining and quantifying the variables involved. 103\nThe term production as employed in the current article encompasses both the crop output of 104 agricultural activities and its energetic, mechanical and chemical inputs. While individual 105 inputs are likely characterised by diminishing marginal returns, an assumption of near-linear 106 correlation between aggregate inputs and yield is made here (J. M. Salles et al., 2017). The 107 assessment of intensity using output as a proxy has been a staple of land sharing/sparing 108 studies. The explicit negation of a linear linkage between the two will be nevertheless taken 109 into account when examining different conceptual approaches. In this case a distinction 110 between inputs, here termed intensity, and outputs, designated as yield, will be introduced. 111\nAs for ecological function, biodiversity and other ecosystem services have been historically 112 favoured as proxies to assess the response of an environment to changes in land use. 113 However, the choice of indicator remains controversial. In most studies, biodiversity is 114 approached at a landscape scale and with a focus on above-ground taxa, which benefits from 115 solid foundations using surveys and structured indexing (Clergue et al., 2009). However, the 116 observable biodiversity is often a partial and imperfect measure of the ecosystem at large and 117 distinct from the ecological function a landscape delivers (Hagan et al., 2021). Similarly, the 118 very concept of ecosystem services have been the object of intense scrutiny in recent years, 119 with criticism focusing on their alleged anthropocentrism and utilitarianism (Muradian & 120 G\u00f3mez-Baggethun, 2021; Schr\u00f6ter et al., 2014) as well as the widely divergent scope of its 121 application in different contexts (Kull et al., 2015). Nevertheless, the use of biodiversity 122 indices and ecologically-relevant elements of the ecosystem service framework are still 123 pivotal to our understanding of global patterns in response to anthropic disturbance. Our 124 proposed hybrid concept of ecological function is meant to encompass a variety of 125 performance indicators, taken individually or as bundles of largely collinear metrics. As an 126 illustration, to test the proposed models below we used alpha diversity metrics for above 127 ground taxa (B. Phalan et al., 2011). Given a degraded reference point however, beta-128 diversity dissimilarities would be an equally acceptable choice (Bray & Curtis, 1957). 129\nA broad and all-encompassing definition of these variables -production, intensity and 130 ecological function- makes it possible to create a common scaffolding to frame a variety of 131 published models. These proposed models link what was here broadly categorised as 132\necological function versus production. We here propose a five-way taxonomy using linear 133 relations or simple curves. 134\nFirst, there are the convex and concave models (Figure 1 (A)), usually presented in parallel 135 and described by curves borrowed from species-density or survivorship functions (Green et 136 al., 2005; B. Phalan et al., 2011; J.-M. Salles et al., 2017). The convex model (Green et al. 137 (2005) use convex and concave as seen from the origin instead) involves a mild decline in 138 ecological function at low production followed by a sharp downturn at high production. Its 139 mirrored counterpart across the diagonal, the concave model, is characterised by a steep 140 downward trend at low production, followed by an anelastic phase. When it comes to sorting 141 the trade-off between production and ecological function the optimal production values lie at 142 the lower end for the convex model and at the higher end for the concave model. The third 143 conceptual model (Figure 1A)) is rarely expressed in mathematical terms, but the formula 144 underpinning it is implicit by its theoretical definition. Some authors insist on the drivers of 145 the land use debate being chiefly ethical in nature (Loconto et al., 2020). A radical 146 interpretation of this approach, denying inherent conservation advantages of any specific 147 production level other than in an ethical dimension, would result in what we will call the 148 \u201cethical\u201d model, in reference to its theoretical foundation rather than its perceived superiority. 149 The only points of the plane satisfying this relation are arranged in a downwards linear trend 150 along the diagonal (Figure 1 A). 151\nThe remaining two models are characterised by their rejection of one of the two implicit 152 trade-offs accepted by the previous ones, which means that the production variable will be 153 split between the now diverging components of yield and intensity. The no yield trade-off 154 model (Figure 1 (B)), while accepting the reduction of ecological function along an intensity 155 gradient, as in the ethical model, postulates that the same levels of production reached by 156 high-input systems can be obtained by conservation-oriented systems. While most proponents 157 of de-intensification recognize a yield gap with conventional high-input agriculture (Wilbois 158 & Schmidt, 2019), some authors outright reject the claim that agricultural output is input-159 limited (Altieri, 1999; Vandermeer & Perfecto, 2005). This view is fundamentally a variation 160 of the ethical model, that introduces a decoupling of production into yield and intensity 161 components, and involves the presence of an optimal point at high yield and low intensity. 162 Finally, the no function trade-off model (Figure 1(C)) is based on exactly the opposite 163 premise: a direct correlation between intensity and yield is accepted, but the reduction of 164 ecological function at high production is rejected, making intensive agricultural systems 165 always advantageous. This model is interesting as a theoretical exercise but might be 166 applicable only in specific real-world circumstances, for example where agricultural 167 production occurs in extremely poor or degraded environments. 168\n3. A unifying approach: the sigmoid response model 169\nExcept for the speculative frameworks that deny the two fundamental trade-offs between 170 yield and intensity and between intensity and ecological function (Figure 1 B & C), which 171 better belong in the theory rather than the practice of land use (De Ponti et al., 2012; Dudley 172 & Alexander, 2017; Kravchenko et al., 2017; Outhwaite et al., 2022), the models describe to 173 differing extents patterns that can be observed in real agroecosystems, albeit with the 174 simplifications required at high levels of generalisations. The convex model describes well 175 the resilience of natural ecosystems to small levels of disturbance (Figure 1A). The concave 176 one illustrates the relatively inflexible response of ecological function under marginally 177 increasing levels of stress. The ethical model fits the cases where transitions in ecological 178 functions occur near-linearly at mid-range agricultural production (Figure 1A). While these 179\nthree models are conceived as mutually exclusive - and they are in their original formulation - 180 we argue they collectively describe a single complex response pattern. This response pattern 181 is better approached and described starting from the well-researched theoretical framework of 182 alternative stable states (Beisner et al., 2003; May, 1977). As observed in many seminatural 183 environments, the response to stress is not a linear one but tends to coalesce around areas of 184 higher stability. In the same way, while agricultural intensity can be seen as a continuous 185 gradient, the environmental response to it is in most conditions segmental and almost discrete 186 (Seppelt et al., 2016). 187\nAt low production, biological buffering systems can compensate for exogenous stress and the 188 resilience phase is maintained (Phelan, 2004). Total biodiversity is not affected until the 189 tolerance threshold of a sizeable minority of species is reached. As for ecosystem services, 190 functional redundancy ensures that the loss of some less resistant taxa does not interfere with 191 general trophic chain stability and biogeochemical cycles (Jurburg & Salles, 2015). With 192 increasing production, a phase of transition follows, where the loss of key taxa has a 193 cascading effect on the provision and catalysis of environmental and ecological services. 194 According to the nature of the system and the measured parameter, this phase can be either a 195 sudden collapse or a more gradual decline with resilience and buffering still working to an 196 extent, but not enough to stem the decline from the original threshold. With increasing stress 197 from agricultural activities, a new stable state is reached, the tolerance phase, with its own 198 mechanisms of resilience and buffering (Cropp & Gabric, 2019). A simplified set of 199 functions is performed by assemblages of organisms largely tolerant to stress. Specific 200 elements are depleted until they reach the threshold of their recalcitrant pools. It is possible to 201 imagine this state as the resilience phase preceding a new transition. Indeed, multiple stable 202 states have been described in natural ecosystems subject to disturbance (Moffett et al., 2015). 203 The presence of more than two alternative stable states in agricultural systems is more 204 unlikely, but it should not be discounted. The model we are proposing in its basic form does 205 not cover multiple stable states with stepwise transitions, but it could still be used to cover 206 discrete parts of the intensity range. 207\nFor the formulation of a model suitable to represent the transition between alternative stable 208 states in an agricultural context, we used an implementation of the sigmoidal response (1), a 209 common stress response function in many biotic systems. The P independent variable can be 210 taken to represent production, expressed as a fraction of the maximum attainable level, which 211 is assigned a unit value. fmax is taken to be the level of the ecological function under 212 investigation at production zero, before stress is applied. fc refers to the core function, i.e. the 213 surviving level of ecological function in the simplified stable state, expressed as a fraction of 214 fmax. \u03c3 (sensitivity) is a parameter determining the slope of the function in the transition 215 phase. Higher values are associated with a steeper transition. While no assumptions are made 216 about hysteresis, and the sigmoid response model is not meant to describe a time series, it is 217 worth noting that steeper transition phases are most often associated with irreversible change 218 (Meyer, 2016). E is the ecological efficiency of the system, defined by the value of P at 219 which the function reaches the mid-point of its transition phase (Figure 2). 220\n(1) \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc43) = \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc50 + \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65\u2212\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc50\n1+10\u2212\ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc38\u2212\ud835\udc43) 221\nThe function in Equation (1), in addition to the central case of a clearly identifiable sigmoidal 222 shape with a linear transition phase connecting the two asymptotic phases, resilience and 223 tolerance, is flexible enough to approximate the other models discussed previously above 224 (Figure 3). The convex model can be generated using a high value of E and a low value of \u03c3. 225\nConversely, the concave model is obtained with values of ecological efficiency approaching 226 0 and medium \u03c3 values. Even the linear ethical model can be approximated with a central 227 value of 0.5 for ecological efficiency and an extremely low sensitivity to expand the 228 transition phase. The two no trade-off models are similarly approached, and their graphic 229 representation looks the same when P is taken to represent yield. However, they can be 230 separated theoretically by using an extremely high ecological efficiency in the case of the no 231 yield trade-off model and a fc value equal to fmax for the no function trade-off. 232\nA conceptual representation of the simplified models along these lines is also helpful to 233 understand the mechanisms at play that make one of the phases of the sigmoid curve 234 dominant over the others, generating the impression of a simpler curve. Convex type relations 235 involve a high level of resilience driven by substantial functional redundancy and are 236 followed by a rapid collapse to levels that are just a tiny fraction of the extensive diversity 237 originally present. Concave curves are observed when the initial level of functional 238 redundancy is quite limited and where the core function level is proportionally higher. The 239 ethical model assumes the absence of stable states, at least within the considered range of 240 stress levels. Even the extreme no-trade off models, for yield and function, become clearer to 241 grasp when they are interpreted respectively as the ability to carry out production entirely 242 within the resilience phase of the system and as production occurring in a system that is 243 already in a simplified and depleted state from the start. 244\nSummarising, we argue that all commonly theorised production/function models are just 245 special cases of a more universal sigmoidal relation, where the dominance of one or two of 246 the three phases masks the presence of the others (Cormont et al., 2016). Three-phased 247 configurations of the sigmoid response are actually the norm for a variety of parameters. 248 Density functions for single species offer a good insight into the mechanistic reasons behind 249 the sigmoidal nature of community response to agricultural intensification and the 250 configurations where one or more phases of the sigmoid are emphasised. 251 Phalan et al. (2011), based on comprehensive databases of tree and bird species from Ghana 252 and India categorised the response of individual species to a gradient of agricultural 253 intensification into four main categories, each characterised by a typical yield-density curve 254 type (A. Balmford et al., 2015). The majority of surveyed species could be clearly assigned to 255 one of these archetypal clusters (Figure 4 B). On one side are \u201closers\u201d, species that show a 256 declining abundance along an intensification gradient, and that form the majority of surveyed 257 species in agricultural context. These can be further divided into two clusters. Species 258 experiencing a population crash at low intensity have a typically concave density curve. At 259 landscape level these species tend to favour land sparing settings. On the opposite, species 260 that tend to preserve good densities at all but the highest levels of agricultural intensification 261 can have their density response represented by a convex curve and fare better in land sharing 262 contexts. The other side is made up of \u201cwinners\u201d, a small number of species that benefit from 263 agricultural conversion, either through niche creation or reduction of competition. This 264 second group also comes in two flavours, mirroring the phenomenon described for \u201closers\u201d. 265 On one hand some species show a convex density response, with a sharp increase in numbers 266 occurring at low levels of intensification and plateauing at higher level. Other species remain 267 at low densities for all but the highest levels of the intensification gradient and show a 268 characteristically convex growth profile. 269\nWhile none of these individual species\u2019 clusters show a typically sigmoidal, three-phased 270 response to intensification, it is possible to show that communities made up of combinations 271 of these groups in proportions registered in nature can generate an aggregate species richness 272\nprofile very accurately described by the proposed sigmoidal model (Figure 3 A). A 273 simulation run on mock communities, each comprising a thousand species belonging to the 274 four different categories, show highly distinctive species richness profiles. With the 275 percentage of \u201cwinners\u201d kept to one fifth of the total \u2013 a quote consistent with surveys (B. 276 Phalan et al., 2011) \u2013 the ratio between \u201cconvex\u201d and \u201cconcave\u201d winners is shown to 277 dramatically change the overall shape of the function, shifting the weight towards specific 278 phases of the sigmoidal response. An even partition between the two results in the linear, 279 transition phase of the sigmoid to almost completely obscures the asymptotic phases, 280 approaching the resulting function of the previously described ethical model. A prevalence of 281 \u201cconvex losers\u201d results in a strongly elongated resilience phase, with higher productions 282 achievable without substantial diversity loss. Conversely, a prevalence of \u201cconcave losers\u201d 283 results in a shortening of the resilience phase and a parallel elongation of the tolerance phase 284 of the sigmoid, with wide scope for intensification at high levels without further decreases in 285 diversity. 286\nIn all the above-mentioned cases, fitting the proposed sigmoidal function to the simulated 287 data results in very high coefficients of determination (R2>0.99), confirming the mechanistic 288 basis for the theoretical foundation of the model. The same observed pattern could also 289 explain why landscape scale ecosystem services based on the direct or indirect activity of 290 biotic communities have also been associated with a sigmoidal development in response to 291 disturbance (Locatelli et al., 2017; Tscharntke et al., 2012). Along the same lines, transition 292 between steady states has been used to interpret long-term trends like soil carbon content 293 following changes in management intensity (Janzen et al., 1998). Even geochemical functions 294 that depend on the activity of biotic communities, such as soil nitrous oxide emissions in 295 response to increased production, have been described with a characteristic shape associated 296 with steady states (Hickman et al., 2017). These steady states, with asymptotic phases linked 297 by a linear transition, are probably driven by a saturation of the processing capabilities of 298 core microbial communities under high fertilisation. 299\n4. A shift of paradigm: production-first to preservation-first 300\nDespite structural criticism about the inherent crude reductionism of the approach, land 301 sharing and land sparing as extremes of a conceptual continuum are still pivotal concepts in 302 the formulation of global land use strategies. The lexical and ideological nature of the debate 303 can be rejected, but the decision of an optimal level of production for individual 304 agroecosystems is inescapable and the decision to adopt extensive or intensive farming 305 practices on a specific extent of land brings back the dualism in full force. Identifying which 306 of the two clusters of management techniques has structural advantages in specific conditions 307 is a valuable contribution for land management policies (Phalan, 2018). In particular, since 308 the adoption of a single approach at a global scale is deemed an undesirable option (Kremen, 309 2015), instruments for allocating land in specific circumstances are required. Gaining a 310 foothold in the understanding of general patterns linking agricultural production to 311 biodiversity and ecological function is a necessary step in this direction. 312\nThe level of production, P, is defined here as constrained between 0, on non-farmed land, and 313 1, for the intensity generating the maximum attainable yield. For a given unit of land, we 314 define s as the ratio of land under productive use and 1-s the unfarmed, wild fraction. The 315 yield of the plot (Y) will be therefore 316\n(2) \ud835\udc4c = \ud835\udc60 \u22c5 \ud835\udc43 317\nSimilarly, the ecological function of land under agriculture at a productivity P can be 318 represented by a function f(P). It is convenient to define f(P) as a spatial density of ecological 319 function, so that the aggregated ecological function for a unit of land combining cultivated 320 and uncultivated fractions can be expressed as 321\n(3) \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61(\ud835\udc43, \ud835\udc60) = \ud835\udc60 \u22c5 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc43) + (1 \u2212 \ud835\udc60) \u22c5 \ud835\udc53(0) 322\nThis model is not explicitly taking into account scale effects in the preservation of ecological 323 function across the landscape. Such effects obviously exist and often take the shape of 324 positive feedbacks in ecosystem service dynamics (Segre et al., 2022) or reduced 325 performance due to fragmentation and minimum habitat requirements (Andersson & Bodin, 326 2014) but are beyond the scope of this streamlined conceptual model. A dynamic definition 327 of f(P) compensating for landscape cohesion would moreover result in more accurate 328 predictions (Villard & Metzger, 2014). Similarly, in the context of broad conceptualisation, 329 no effort was made to integrate a possible divergence between yield and economic values of 330 commodities (Sidemo-Holm et al., 2021). 331\nSubstituting (2), we obtain 332\n(4) \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61(\ud835\udc43, \ud835\udc4c) = \ud835\udc53(0) \u2212 \ud835\udc4c\n\ud835\udc43 \u2219 [\ud835\udc53(0) \u2212 \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc43)] 333\nWhen keeping Y constant, equation (4) can represent the variation of ecological function at 334 constant yield along a sharing-sparing continuum. The resulting curves (Figure 4 (A)) can be 335 named isokarps, from Ancient Greek \u1f34\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 (equal) and \u03ba\u1fb0\u03c1\u03c0\u03cc\u03c2 (harvest). These curves can be 336 plotted on an ecological function versus productivity plot. Since 337\n(5) \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61(\ud835\udc43, \ud835\udc4c = \ud835\udc43) = \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc43) 338\nthe constraint on permissible values of P draws the envelope of f(P). Isokarps for P values left 339 of this curve are not permissible given the constraint of a limited surface, and are represented 340 by dashed curves. Furthermore, points representing authentic land sharing scenarios are 341 organised along the f(P) curve, while points representing land sparing scenarios are located 342 along the vertical axis (P=1). The area between these two limiting curves represents 343 intermediate solutions between sparing and sharing. 344\nUsing the same mathematical scaffolding already introduced, it is possible to rearrange (4) to 345 express the yield as a function of productivity for a given ecological function: 346\n(6) \ud835\udc4c(\ud835\udc43, \ud835\udc39) = \ud835\udc43 \u2219 \ud835\udc53(0)\u2212\ud835\udc39\n\ud835\udc53(0)\u2212\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc43) 347\n(6) therefore represents curves of constant ecological function, which we will call isoergs, 348 from Ancient Greek \u1f34\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 (equal) and \u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd (action, function). These can be plotted on a yield 349 versus productivity plot (Figure 4(B)). The line Y=P delimits the permissible values of P and 350 is the equivalent of the f ( P) curve on the isokarp plot. Isoergs for P values left of this line are 351 not permissible given the constraint on minimum production on a limited surface, and are 352 represented in dashed curves. By analogy with the isokarp plot, points representing land 353 sharing scenarios are organised along the Y=P line, points representing land sparing scenarios 354 are located along the vertical axis (P=1), and the area between these two limiting lines 355 represents intermediate solutions between sparing and sharing 356\nBoth approaches are equally useful to represent respectively ecological function as a result of 357 production and yield, or yield as a result of production and ecological function. Traditional, 358 production-first, land use models are conceptually based on the constraint of meeting a 359 defined production target. The isokarp space can therefore turn from a mere representation 360 tool into a conceptual space where ecological function is maximised following the 361 introduction of enforced agricultural production targets. However, we argue that such a 362 production-first approach is conceptually unfit to correctly frame the land-sharing issues. The 363 concept of yield targets in a land use context is improperly borrowed from the jargon of 364 former planned economies (Dovring, 1982; Xianling et al., 2016). Such targets are not 365 grounded in the current economic reality of land management, where profit is always 366 maximised by rational players and only constrained by externally enforced limits or positive 367 incentives. Externally enforced limits, in the context of the land sharing / sparing debate, are 368 bound to take the form of preservation constraints. We therefore introduced the concept of 369 preservation thresholds (\u03b8) to replace yield targets to orient decisions about land 370 management. This change of paradigm involves switching away from the setting of a target 371 for food production and then maximising ecological function within this limit, which might 372 not be sustainable for either humans or the natural ecosystems. We advocate instead assessing 373 a minimum limit of ecological function necessary for ecosystem and human survival and 374 second economical behaviour by maximising production within this constraint. This change 375 can be conceptualised using isoergs. When \u03b8 replaces F in (6) we enter a conceptual space 376 where yield is maximised within the constrained of an enforced preservation target. The 377 resulting isoerg space becomes a precious tool to address the land sharing / sparing debate 378 from more realistic premises. 379\n5. Synthesis: approaching the land sharing / sparing debate 380\nWe argued earlier that realistic ecological functions are in general best represented using a 381 sigmoid shape. We introduced above a typical sigmoid function based on the logistic function 382 (equation 1), but the following will be valid for any sigmoid function, which can be defined 383 in this context as any monotonic, strictly decreasing function which is at first convex, then 384 concave. 385\nWhen f(P) takes the form of a sigmoid, it can be shown that the isokarps ft (P,Y) are 386 necessarily unimodal with one minimum in respect to P on the interval 0 \u2264 P \u2264 1. It follows 387 that for each given yield, optimal solutions i.e. scenarios that maximise average ecological 388 function on the whole plot of land can only be found on either end of the sharing-sparing 389 continuum (Figure 4 (A)). Specifically, the transition point is located where the chord 390 connecting the sigmoid at P=0 and at P=1 intersects the same sigmoid. This chord can be 391 termed the critical chord by analogy with Green et al. (2005). To the right of this point, 392 optimal production levels fall in the land sparing region and require P=1. To the left of this 393 point, optimal production levels fall in the land sparing region for values of P. 394 It is however useful to move to the isoerg-based conceptual space to explore the relation 395 between yield and preservation thresholds (Figure 4 (B)). The level of P identified by the 396 intersection of the sigmoid with its critical chord allows to determine the value of \u03b8 at which 397 land sharing and land sparing strategies do not have inherent advantages. For lower values of 398 preservation threshold, land sparing at P=1 will have a competitive advantage, whereas for 399 higher values the optimal P levels will fall in the land sharing region. Except when \u03b8 is lower 400 than fc \u2013 i.e .the preservation threshold is never overshot and land sparing always 401 advantageous when aiming at maximal possible yield - it is possible to identify the peaks of 402 each isoerg along the diagonal as the land sharing optima, and the ends of the isoergs along 403\nthe P=1 axis as the land sparing optima respectively. The relative height of these two points 404 determine which is advantageous for maximising yield, for given combinations of the three 405 parameters of the sigmoid function, and for each given level of preservation threshold. 406\n6. Discussion 407\nThe assumption of a sigmoidal link between production and ecological function, and the 408 existence of alternate stable states underpinning it, is an effective conceptual framework to 409 interpret the effect of various land management options. In particular, it can explain both the 410 successes and possible malfunctions of conservation and regenerative agriculture practices. 411 More specifically, the model can be used to predict under what conditions such practices are 412 more likely to yield significant benefits, and in what conditions their use is likely to incur 413 heavy trade-offs. Fitting a sigmoidal response curve can be achieved when few datapoints are 414 available, linking production levels to observed biodiversity of ecosystem function within the 415 same landscape and scale. In this way, many of the observed instances of failure of de-416 intensification programmes to maintain profitable yields find a convincing explanation, even 417 when they succeed in improving biodiversity and ecological functions (Leifeld, 2014). When 418 agricultural systems operate at the high-intensity end of production, well into the tolerance 419 phase of the system, small gains in ecological function will normally come at the price of a 420 significant reduction in yield (Seufert et al., 2012). The typically diminished response to 421 increasing levels of disturbance in the degraded stable state of intensively cultivated arable 422 land plays strongly against the viability of attempts at de-intensification (Millard et al., 2021). 423 However, this does not mean that there is not a place for species-rich rotations, cover crops, 424 conservation tillage and organic amendments in modern agriculture. Indeed, the same 425 sigmoidal response framework offers clear indications as to the conditions where they can 426 express their full potential. To identify them, we can explore the ways the equilibrium of a 427 system can be shifted in favour of land sharing. Among the four variables considered so far, 428 the three parameters of the sigmoidal response curve and the preservation threshold, two (the 429 core function and sensitivity) are specific to the ecological function and the environmental 430 context, and cannot be manipulated. They can, however, orient choices in land management. 431 According to the isoerg conceptual model, raising the core function does not influence the 432 production level at which sharing and sparing are equivalent (Figure 6), but it raises the 433 preservation threshold at which the two strategies are equivalent. When less of the original 434 ecological function is lost at high production, higher enforced protection is required to 435 disincentivise maximum production. De-intensification techniques and extensive cultivation 436 strategies are anticipated to suit better settings where the difference between the pristine state 437 and the post-perturbation state is more pronounced (Standish et al., 2014), which is to say 438 lower core function values. Identification of such areas is therefore key. On one hand, it is 439 possible to argue that complex and rich systems \u2013 like the ones in pristine tropical areas - are 440 able to retain substantial residual function even after disturbance. On the other hand, in 441 poorer and simplified starting contexts, like the ones likely to be encountered in historically 442 cultivated temperate areas, the subset functions that have survived centuries of anthropic 443 activities can be thought to be less impacted by additional stress, making the difference 444 between fmax and fc less pronounced. Whichever of the two patterns prevails for the 445 ecological function under consideration is likely to have a big influence on the prospects of 446 success of land sharing. 447 Sensitivity (\u03c3) is closely linked to core function, and less likely to shift the balance of the 448 preferable land use strategy. Nevertheless, high sensitivity and lower core function values can 449 be associated with hysteresis phenomena (Litzow & Hunsicker, 2016), a relevant 450 consideration for non-productive reconversion of cropland. Moreover, low levels of sigma 451\nare indicative of small magnitudes in the difference in outcome between the two strategies, 452 approximating what we termed the \u201cethical\u201d model. 453 The other two parameters of the sigmoid response model, namely efficiency and preservation 454\nthreshold, offer more scope for substantial intervention and manipulation. Increasing the 455\npreservation threshold, fundamentally a policy intervention, has the effect of excluding 456\nscenarios favourable to land sparing, while retaining the land sharing options (Figure 4b). 457\nEnforcing stricter environmental measures is indeed a very effective policy tool if the aim is 458\nmoving the equilibrium towards low-intensity agriculture (Mupepele et al., 2021; Phalan et 459\nal., 2016). However, it involves lowering yields, financial margins and global production 460\ncompared to restriction-free agricultural systems. 461\nRaising the land sharing peak of the isoerg curve above the land sharing counterpart is the 462 only option to make land sharing more competitive without impacting overall yield. 463 Increased levels of ecological efficiency, i.e., reaching higher yields in the resilience phase of 464 the production curve, can dramatically shift the equilibrium (Figure 6). This would however 465 require a substantial shift of paradigm compared to the recent technological history of 466 agriculture (Evenson & Gollin, 2003). Since the green revolution with the mass use of 467 nitrogen fertiliser produced by the Haber\u2013Bosch process, and advances in crop breeding, 468 global agriculture has witnessed an unprecedented push in the tolerance phase of production 469 systems. In particular, selective breeding for high yielding crops with high chemical and 470 mechanical inputs has given farmers access to the tools for more intensive high-density 471 production. The effect in the sigmoid response framework has been a striking lengthening of 472 the tolerance phase compared to the resilience phase, which resulted in a decline in ecological 473 efficiency at a global scale (i.e., a leftward shift of the transition phase compared to 474 maximum production). This is the ultimate root of the structural disadvantage of land sharing 475 strategies emerging in literature (A. Balmford et al., 2015). Underpinning the tolerance of 476 agricultural systems, attempts at de-intensification are unlikely to be met with success, and 477 their poor performance may discourage further efforts. Identification of less intensive farming 478 strategies will be instrumental in giving land managers the possibility to choose between two 479 competitive strategies for a wider set of environmental conditions and preservation policies, 480 together with large-scale socio-political rethinking (Fischer et al., 2017) and technological 481 advancements. 482\nConcerning the latter, improvements in conservation agriculture techniques and crop 483 diversity with multi-species, and optimised rotations that include cover crops, are important 484 tools to raise the ecological efficiency and yield at low input levels. This would be 485 particularly relevant where soils are degraded after high-intensity production when the stable 486 state is severely depleted compared to the undisturbed state. However, arable techniques 487 alone may only bring marginal improvements, while new crops generated by improved 488 breeding and gene editing could bring dramatic shifts in low input agriculture (Lotz et al., 489 n.d.; Wickson et al., 2016). These developments gave land sparing a competitive advantage 490 across most of the world (B. Balmford et al., 2019). If the competing land-sharing strategy 491 cannot rely on chemical fertilisers, pesticides and aggressive cultivation, a credible path 492 forward would require a vigorous effort towards the targeted selection of plant traits as well 493 as cover and cash crops. These technical improvements would be able to generate an efficient 494 closed system with minimal inputs (Machado et al., 2022). This is especially relevant in the 495 light of global warming and the renewed interest in the development of drought, heat resistant 496 or early-flowering crop varieties (Karavolias et al., 2021). 497\nThe limitations of the sigmoid response model and the isoerg and preservation threshold 498 conceptual space are linked to the high-level conceptualisation at its basis. However, they 499 also allow to identify possible opportunities for further research that would benefit from this 500 theoretical foundation and greatly expand its potential. Link functions could be used to map 501 scale effects on spared land or to decouple intensity and agricultural production. Moreover, 502 the addition of landscape-scale production thresholds to preservation targets could be 503 implemented in an integrated ecological-function-to-yield response model. 504\nIn summary: 505\n\u2022 firstly, de-intensification techniques are predicted to have more chances of succeeding 506 where the loss of ecological function under intensive management is more 507 pronounced. 508\n\u2022 second, without enforced protection thresholds and policies for the internalisation of 509 environmental costs, de-intensification techniques are unlikely to be competitive, 510 irrespective of the configuration of the other parameters. 511\n\u2022 finally, dramatic improvements in the capability of enhancing production at low 512 chemical and energy inputs, such as targeted genetic improvement of both cover and 513 cash crops to minimise environmental damage and enhance natural biodiversity as 514 well as fine-tuning existing agronomic practices, are the ultimate keys to the global 515 success of alternatives to the prevalent land sparing approach. 516\nWhatever form the evolution in land use patterns will take, the sigmoidal response framework 517 does not only introduce a coherent system in agreement with published literature and 518 experimental results. It also provide insights into the role of de-intensification in the toolkit 519 for sustainable agricultural development of land managers and help predict which 520 interventions can be effective, and in which policy and environmental conditions. 521\n522\n7.

Both sides of the ideological divide have theorised models linking ecological 837 function and production. The manuscript offers a conceptual synthesis harmonising 838 apparently contradictory approaches in a coherent framework. It is argued that conflicting 839 views stem from special cases of a more universal function. This reconciliation helps 840 transcend ideological barriers and focus instead on the structural determinants of ecosystem 841 function preservation under productive land use. In addition to providing clarity on the 842 mechanics linking the response of ecological function to increasing levels of land use 843 intensity, the framework potentially allows for predictions to be made about optimal 844 strategies in different environmental contexts and the policy and technological interventions 845 that are necessary for land sharing strategies to have a chance at large scale implementation 846 despite current structural advantages of land sparing. In synthesis, the manuscript provides an 847 innovative conceptual tool to assess optimal strategies for biodiversity preservation and 848 viable agricultural production. 849"
