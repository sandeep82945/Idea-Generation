Development of Advanced Bio-based Flame Retardants: Explore the synthesis and application of new bio-based flame retardants, focusing on enhancing the flame retardancy of phase change materials (PCMs) without compromising their energy storage capacity and thermal conductivity. This could involve studying different bio-derived compounds that have potential flame-retardant properties, such as modifications to chitosan or new bio-derived synergists that can work in tandem with existing flame retardants like APP.

Hybrid Thermal Management Systems: Investigate the integration of RPCM with other cooling technologies, such as liquid cooling or heat pipes, to create hybrid thermal management systems for lithium-ion batteries. This research could aim at optimizing the synergistic effects of different cooling methods to achieve superior thermal management outcomes, particularly for high-power applications where efficient heat dissipation is critical.

Enhancement of Thermal Conductivity in PCMs: Conduct further research into the optimization of thermal conductive networks within PCMs by incorporating various nanomaterials like graphene, boron nitride, or metallic nanoparticles. The goal would be to achieve higher thermal conductivity without affecting the phase change properties or the flame retardancy of the material. This could involve experimenting with different concentrations, distributions, and orientations of conductive fillers.

Long-term Stability and Recyclability of RPCMs: Examine the long-term thermal stability, cyclic performance, and recyclability of RPCMs in battery thermal management applications. This research could focus on understanding the degradation mechanisms of RPCMs under repeated thermal cycles and developing strategies to enhance their durability and end-of-life recyclability.

Scaling Up and Economic Analysis of RPCM Production: Explore the scalability of the RPCM production process and conduct a comprehensive economic analysis to assess its commercial viability. This would involve identifying cost-effective raw materials, optimizing the manufacturing process for large-scale production, and analyzing the market potential for RPCMs in various applications beyond lithium-ion battery thermal management, such as in building materials for energy-efficient cooling and heating systems.
