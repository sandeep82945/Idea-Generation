They arise as low energy excitations of Bose-Einstein condensates and, in nonhomogeneous situations, are governed by a space- and time-dependent acoustic metric. We discuss how this metric can be experimentally designed to realize curved spacetime geometries, in particular, expanding FriedmannLema\u00eetre-Robertson-Walker cosmologies, with negative, vanishing, or positive spatial curvature. A nonvanishing Hubble rate can be obtained through a time-dependent scattering length of the background condensate. For relativistic quantum fields this leads to the phenomenon of particle production, which we describe in detail. We explain how particle production and other interesting features of quantum field theory in curved spacetime can be tested in terms of experimentally accessible correlation functions.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nWhen studying quantum field theory in curved spacetime, many interesting phenomena and peculiarities arise. Most prominently, allowing for a time-dependence in the metric, which is naturally the case in cosmology, leads to the phenomenon of particle production [1\u20134]. Although indirect signatures of this effect can be observed, for example in the cosmic microwave background, any direct detection is an open challenge. In recent years, an analogy of this phenomenon has been studied in the context of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), as an integral part of the analog gravity program (see [5\u20137] for introductions). More precisely, the linear phononic excitations on top of the ground state of a BEC obey a Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar quantum field in curved spacetime in the acoustic approximation (that is neglecting quantum pressure) [8]. The corresponding metric is the so-called acoustic metric (see also [9, 10] for early developments in the context of fluids) and is fully determined by the background parameters of the BEC, such as the background density or the speed of sound. In this manner, the condensate shapes the spacetime geometry experienced by the acoustic excitations. It has been shown that introducing suitable timedependencies of either the scattering length or the external\n\u2217 mtolosa@thp.uni-koeln.de \u2020 alvaparr@ucm.es \u2021 sanchez@thphys.uni-heidelberg.de \u00a7 t.haas@thphys.uni-heidelberg.de \u00b6 curvedspacetime@matterwave.de \u2217\u2217 stefan.floerchinger@uni-jena.de\ntrapping potential allow for a one-to-one mapping of the acoustic metric onto spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\u00eetreRobertson-Walker (FLRW) metrics [11\u201321]. In this sense, all phononic modes propagate in a spacetime geometry set by the acoustic metric with the same speed of sound. In this way, modern cold atoms experiments allow for a direct analysis of quantum effects in the context of cosmological models. Further theoretical studies in this direction have included quantum pressure leading to a quadratic dispersion relation in the ultraviolet momentum regime and so-called rainbow FLRW metrics [19, 22]. Two-component BECs allowing for an additional massive phononic mode have also been investigated [23, 24]. Recent experimental efforts for simulating an expanding universe in d = 1 + 1 effective spacetime dimensions [25] in the laboratory can be found in [26, 27]. Other interesting phenomena that have been studied within the acoustic metric approach (also experimentally) comprise sonic black holes [9, 10, 28\u201331], the Unruh effect [32\u201334], Hawking radiation [35\u201338] or the dynamic Casimir effect [39]. For an overview over current experimental approaches see Ref. [40]. In this work, we focus on the analogy between the acoustic metric and the FLRW metric for an effectively d = 2 + 1 dimensional isotropic trap, which is a common setup of modern BEC experiments. In contrast to previous works, we derive the acoustic metric by parameterizing the quantum fluctuations on top of the ground state in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the complex nonrelativistic scalar field, instead of magnitude and complex phase (see e.g. [41, 42] for a detailed discussion regarding this parameterization). ar X iv :2 20 2. 10 44 1v 2 [ co nd -m at .q\nua nt\n-g as\n] 2\n2 Fe\nb 20\n22\n2 We generalize previous studies from spatially flat to spatially curved spacetimes. To this end we explicitly consider radial dependencies of the background density profile. We find mappings between FLRW universes of positive and negative spatial curvature and the acoustic metric. After allowing in addition also for a time-dependent scattering length, we analyze particle production in different types of expanding cosmologies. In this sense, we extend on earlier considerations by providing an exact mapping to a more general class of cosmologies and by showing how the effect of particle production is accessible experimentally. Note that some technical details on the cosmology side are provided in our companion paper [43]. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we introduce isotropic traps in a quasi twodimensional geometry and make an ansatz for the quantum effective action. We derive conditions on the background parameters such that the background density remains static. We also compute the acoustic metric from the effective action for the fluctuations and discuss the external potentials required for a one-to-one mapping between the acoustic metric and FLRW metrics of positive and negative curvature. Thereupon, we investigate the properties of the arising FLRW universes by comparing the dynamics of radially outmoving phonons. In Sec. III we derive a formalism for the spectrum of fluctuations and the two-point correlation function of a rescaled density contrast for different types of (spatially curved) cosmologies. We study both quantities in Sec. IV for various experimentally accessible scenarios and point out robust features. Finally, we give a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and formulate an outlook in Sec. V. Notation. In this paper we work in SI units. For convenience, we use operator hats for creation and annihilation operators and drop them otherwise. Greek indices \u00b5, \u03bd run from 0 to 2, while latin indices i, j only run from 1 to 2. Also, vectors are denoted by bold symbols."

            "text": "Let us begin our analysis with the quantum effective action of a nonrelativistic complex scalar field equipped with a quartic contact interaction term. This is an accurate description for the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate, i.e. a weakly coupled Bose gas, where most atoms occupy the ground state. We denote the bosonic field\nexpectation value (in general in the presence of sources) in d = 3 + 1 spacetime dimensions by \u03c8(t, r). We consider a pancake-type geometry in cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03d5, z) and a condensate that is tightly confined in the z-direction. Then, the extension of the condensate in z-direction lz is much smaller than in the longitudinal direction lr, i.e. lz lr, leading to a quasi d = 2 + 1 dimensional geometry. Due to the strong confinement in z-direction, the motional degrees of freedom in this direction are frozen in, such that the mean field \u03c8(t, r) separates according to \u03c8(t, r) = \u03a6(t, r, \u03d5)\u03b6(z), where \u03b6(z) is typically of Gaussian form.\nWe study the dynamics of the field \u03a6(t, r) in effectively d = 2 + 1 spacetime dimensions. Then, the ansatz for the action reads [41]\n\u0393[\u03a6] = \u222b dt d2r { i~\u03a6\u2217(\u2202t + iA0)\u03a6\n\u2212 ~ 2 2m (\u2207\u2212 iA)\u03a6\u2217(\u2207 + iA)\u03a6\u2212 \u03bb 2 (\u03a6\u2217\u03a6)2\n} . (1)\nHere, m denotes the mass of the atoms and \u03bb = \u03bb(t) is a time-dependent coupling, which can be expressed in terms of the s-wave scattering length as(t) within Born\u2019s approximation [44],\n\u03bb(t) = \u221a 8\u03c0\u03c9z~3 m as(t), (2)\nwhere \u03c9z is the trapping frequency in z-direction. Furthermore, we introduced an external U(1) gauge field A = (A0,A) such that there is a symmetry of the action \u0393[\u03a6] under the local U(1) transformation\n\u03a6(t, r)\u2192 e\u2212i\u03b1(t,r)\u03a6(t, r), A0(t, r)\u2192 A0(t, r) + \u2202t\u03b1(t, r), A(t, r)\u2192 A(t, r) + \u2207\u03b1(t, r).\n(3)\nAn external trapping potential is then given by A0(t, r) = V (t, r)/~. In our analysis, we restrict to isotropic trapping potentials of the form\nV (t, r) = m\n2 \u03c92(t)f(r), (4)\nwhere \u03c9(t) is a time-dependent parameter and f(r) is typically a polynomial in r. Without loss of generality we can assume f(0) = 0. For example, f(r) = r2 corresponds to the commonly used harmonic trap, in which case \u03c9(t) plays the role of a trapping frequency. Moreover, in chemical equilibrium the chemical potential would enter A0 such that A0(t, r) = (V (t, r)\u2212 \u00b5) /~.\nIn the following, we will work with a linear splitting of the fundamental field \u03a6 into a background part \u03c60 and a fluctuating part parametrized by two real fields \u03c61 and \u03c62, such that\n\u03a6(t, r) = \u03c60(t, r) + 1\u221a 2 [\u03c61(t, r) + i\u03c62(t, r)] . (5)\n3 Therein, we allowed for general space- and timedependencies for all fields. In the present work, we do not consider any explicit backreaction of fluctuations to the form of the action. The fluctuations are assumed to be small enough and will be kept only to linear order in equations of motion corresponding to quadratic order in the action. Conceptually this corresponds to a background field which is well described by mean field equations. We will also not consider any renormalization of the couplings in the action. In this sense, the action (1) can actually be identified with (an approximation of) the quantum effective action, which is renormalized already.\nWe are particularly interested in evaluating the effective action at the point where the field equation of motion is satisfied,\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\u03a6(t, r) \u0393[\u03a6] = 0. (6)\nThe background field \u03c60(t, r) corresponds then to an expectation value of the microscopic field or quantum operator in the absence of sources (up to a wave function renormalization constant). The normalization implicit in equation (1) is such that ns = |\u03a6|2 is the superfluid density, which at vanishing temperature equals the full density n = ns. For A0 = V/~ and A = 0, the classical field \u03c60(t, r) is a solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [45, 46]\ni~\u2202t\u03c60 = ( \u2212 ~ 2\n2m \u22072 + V + \u03bb|\u03c60|2\n) \u03c60. (7)\nThe superfluid behavior of the condensate mean field \u03c60(t, r) can be highlighted by introducing the Madelung representation [47],\n\u03c60(t, r) = \u221a n0(t, r)e iS0(t,r), (8)\nwith n0(t, r) = |\u03c60(t, r)|2 denoting the background particle number density and S0(t, r) being the background phase of the condensate\u2019s mean field. Using the parametrization (8) in Eq. (7) leads to a pair of hydrodynamic equations. Namely, one obtains the local conservation law or continuity equation\n0 = \u2202tn0 + \u2207(n0v), (9)\nand the Euler equation [48]\n0 = ~\u2202tS0 + V + \u03bbn0 + ~2\n2m (\u2207S0)2.

Note that q in Eq. (12) is of second order in ~, as well as in spatial derivatives, such that it is expected to be subleading for sufficiently smooth density.\nThe dynamics of the background variables required to mimic FLRW universes for the fluctuating variables will be discussed in Sec.

Note that we have set n\u03040 = 1. Decreasing the coupling \u03bbi = 1\u2192 \u03bbf = \u03bbi/2 = 1/2 and changing the trapping potential V (t, r) accordingly leads to a stationary background density profile n0(r). In order to illustrate this we set all SI units to 1.\nIf the coupling \u03bb(t) is changed over time, the latter condition has to be fulfilled in order to guarantee a stationary density profile of the form (15).\nLet us discuss a couple of choices for the radial dependence of the trap encoded in f(r). For f(r) = r2, we obtain the well-known Thomas-Fermi density profile in a harmonic trap and R corresponds to the Thomas-Fermi radius, while f(r) = F\u03b8(r \u2212 R) with F \u2192 \u221e leads to a homogeneous density profile in the region r < R. The latter allows for a mapping to a flat FLRW cosmology, which is discussed in detail in [18].\nAs we will show later, spatially curved but homogeneous and isotropic FLRW universes follow from radial dependencies of the trap and density profiles of the form\nf(r) = \u00b12r2 \u2212 r 4\nR2 and n0(r) = n\u03040\n[ 1\u2213 r 2\nR2\n]2 .

Note that decreasing the coupling \u03bb(t) and adjusting the parameter \u03c9(t) accordingly over time never breaks the confinement condition \u03c9(t) \u03c9z, provided that it is fulfilled initially."

            "text": "The relation between the density profiles (19) and the spatially curved FLRW universes is illustrated in Fig. 2 a). Thereupon, let us further comment on the different sets of spatial coordinates and their geometric meaning.\nThe spatial FLRW line element (37) is written in terms of reduced-circumference polar coordinates in two spatial dimensions (u, \u03d5), which is a convenient choice also in cosmology. The radial coordinate transformation in (35) corresponds (up to a factor of 2) to the transformation between reduced-circumference polar coordinates and polar coordinates in the polar plane (r \u2264 R,\u03d5) for \u03ba > 0, or in the Poincar\u00e9 disk model (r \u2264 R,\u03d5) for \u03ba < 0. Hence, the laboratory line element (34) describes at every instance of time t, depending on spatial curvature, a polar disk or a Poincar\u00e9 disk. The arising spatially curved geometries in the laboratory coordinates (r, \u03d5) may be understood from the more intuitive spherical and hyperboloid models, for which we make a distinction of cases. For the positively curved universe (\u03ba > 0), we start from three-dimensional Euclidean space R3 with cartesian coordinates (X,Y, Z) and line element\nds2 = dX2 + dY 2 + dZ2. (41)\nA two-sphere of radius R/2 is embedded in this space via the equation\nR2/4 = X2 + Y 2 + Z2. (42)\nPoints on the sphere can be represented by two angles \u03b8\u2032 \u2208 [0, \u03c0], \u03d5\u2032 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0), which can be mapped to the global coordinates via\n(X,Y, Z) = R/2 (sin \u03b8\u2032 cos\u03d5\u2032, sin \u03b8\u2032 sin\u03d5\u2032, cos\u03d5\u2032) . (43)\nThe induced metric on the two-sphere reads ds2 = R2/4 ( d\u03b8\u20322 + sin2 \u03b8\u2032 d\u03d5\u20322 ) , (44)\nwhich corresponds to an intuitive representation of a positively curved space (cf. Fig. 2 b)). However, the twosphere can also be mapped to the laboratory picture, i.e. the polar disk with coordinates (r, \u03d5), via a stereographic projection from the north pole (0, 0, R/2) onto the disk located at the south pole (0, 0,\u2212R/2) (illustrated with blue lines connecting points on the sphere and in the plane in Fig. 2 b)). Then, the laboratory coordinates are related to the coordinates in S2 by\n(r, \u03d5) = ( R cot \u03b8\u2032 2 , \u03d5\u2032 ) , (45)\nand we obtain the spatial part of the FLRW line element in the laboratory (34), with positive sign. In case of the negatively curved universe (\u03ba < 0), we have to start from three-dimensional Minkowski space M3 instead [50]. Adapting the cartesian coordinates (X,Y, Z) from before leads to a line element of the form\nds2 = dX2 + dY 2 \u2212 dZ2, (46)\nwith an additional minus sign compared to (41). Then, the upper hyperboloid can be embedded in this space through (cf. Fig. 2 c))\n\u2212R2/4 = X2 + Y 2 \u2212 Z2 (47)\n7 with Z > 0. On the hyperboloid, we choose a pseudoangle \u03c3\u2032 \u2208 [0,\u221e) instead of an angle \u03b8\u2032 \u2208 [0, \u03c0], but keep the azimuthal angle \u03d5\u2032 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0). We can express the global coordinates in terms of the latter coordinates as\n(X,Y, Z) = R/2 (sinh\u03c3\u2032 cos\u03d5\u2032, sinh\u03c3\u2032 sin\u03d5\u2032, cosh\u03c3\u2032) , (48)\nleading to an induced metric ds2 = R2/4 ( d\u03c3\u20322 + sinh2 \u03c3\u2032 d\u03d5\u2032 ) , (49)\non the hyperboloid. Finally, we recover the laboratory coordinates (r, \u03d5) by a projection of the hyperboloid onto the Poincar\u00e9 disk located at the south pole of the hyberboloid, i.e. at (0, 0, R/2), using the apex (0, 0,\u2212R/2) of the lower hyperboloid (not shown in Fig. 2 c)) as the base point. This projection is sketched with blue straight lines in Fig. 2 c). We obtain the relation\n(r, \u03d5) = ( R coth \u03c3\u2032 2 , \u03d5\u2032 ) , (50)\nand the spatial part of the FLRW line element (34) with a minus sign for the metric in the Poincar\u00e9 disk."

(58)\nAnother interesting example is the de Sitter universe, which is characterized by the scale factor\na(t) = a0 e Ht, (59)\nwhere H denotes the Hubble parameter and a0 = a(t = 0) is now the initial scale factor. In this case we find\nz(t) = 1\na0HR\n( 1\u2212 e\u2212Ht ) . (60)\nThe resulting trajectories are depicted in the right panel of Fig. 3.

Clearly, the spatial curvature influences the bending of the curves, with stronger / weaker bending for open (black dotted line) / closed (red dashed line) universes compared to the flat one (blue solid line). Again, for convenience, we work with dimensionless parameters.\nwhere f\u0307 \u2261 \u2202tf denotes the partial derivative with respect to time t. The exact form of the Laplace-Beltrami operator depends on the spatial curvature (see below).\nFor spatially curved universes with \u03ba > 0, we transform the radial coordinate u to an angle \u03b8. It is convenient to extend from the half sphere to the full sphere such that \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0). Similarly, for \u03ba < 0 we can introduce the pseudoangle \u03c3 \u2208 [0,\u221e) and for \u03ba = 0 we work with an infinitely extended disk, u \u2208 [0,\u221e). In summary we work with a radial coordinate \u03b8, u or \u03c3 defined by\nu =  sin \u03b8\u221a |\u03ba| for \u03ba > 0,\nu for \u03ba = 0, sinh\u03c3\u221a |\u03ba| for \u03ba < 0.

(l +m)! eim\u03d5 Plm(cos \u03b8), (68)\nwith Plm(cos \u03b8) = (\u22121)mPml (cos \u03b8) denoting the associated Legendre polynomials. Besides this sign, the choice in (68) differs by a factor \u221a 4\u03c0/ \u221a\n2l + 1 from the standard definition of the spherical harmonics. For the flat two-dimensional space one may use polar waves defined in terms of Bessel functions of the first kind\nXkm(u, \u03d5) = e im\u03d5 Jm(ku).

The functions in equations (68), (69) and (70) are normalized with respect to a scalar product as discussed in detail in [43]. With these conventions, the eigenvalues h(k) of the Laplace-Beltrami operator \u2206 defined in Eq. (64) read\nh(k) =  \u2212k(k + \u221a |\u03ba|) for \u03ba > 0,\n\u2212k2 for \u03ba = 0, \u2212 ( k2 + 14 |\u03ba| ) for \u03ba < 0,\n(71)\n9 with the relation k = \u221a |\u03ba|l understood in the two spatially curved cases. Note that h(k = 0) is only nonvanishing for the open universe, \u03ba < 0, and \u221a |\u03ba|/2 acts there like an effective mass gap. The fluctuation field \u03c6 is quantized as usual such that it obeys the (equal time) bosonic commutation relations,\n[\u03c6(t, u, \u03d5), \u03c0(t, u\u2032, \u03d5\u2032)]\n= i~\u03b4(\u03d5\u2212 \u03d5\u2032)\u00d7  \u03b4(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u2032) for \u03ba > 0, \u03b4(u\u2212 u\u2032) for \u03ba = 0, \u03b4(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3\u2032) for \u03ba < 0,\n(72)\nwhere\n\u03c0(t, u, \u03d5) = \u03b4\u03932[\u03c6]\n\u03b4\u03c6\u0307 = ~2\n\u221a g\u03c6\u0307, (73)\ndenotes the conjugate momentum field. To solve the linearized equation of motion (61) for the different classes of universes, we expand the quantum field \u03c6 in terms of the corresponding eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (67),\n\u03c6(t, u, \u03d5)\n= \u222b k,m [ a\u0302kmHkm(u, \u03d5)vk(t) + a\u0302\u2020kmH \u2217 km(u, \u03d5)v \u2217 k(t) ] ,\n(74)\nand similar for the conjugate momentum field \u03c0(t, u, \u03d5). Therein, we used the abbreviation\n\u222b k,m =  \u2211\u221e l=0|\u03ba| l+1/2 2\u03c0 \u2211l m=\u2212l for \u03ba > 0,\u222b dk 2\u03c0 k \u2211\u221e m=\u2212\u221e for \u03ba = 0,\u222b dl\n2\u03c0 |\u03ba|l tanh(\u03c0l) \u2211\u221e m=\u2212\u221e for \u03ba < 0, (75)\nfor the two-dimensional momentum integral. Also, we have introduced creation and annihilation operators a\u0302\u2020km and a\u0302km, respectively, which fulfill the bosonic commutation relations\n[a\u0302\u2020km, a\u0302 \u2020 k\u2032m\u2032 ] = [a\u0302km, a\u0302k\u2032m\u2032 ] = 0,\n[a\u0302km, a\u0302 \u2020 k\u2032m\u2032 ] = 2\u03c0\u03b4mm\u2032  \u03b4ll\u2032 |\u03ba|(l+1/2) for \u03ba > 0, \u03b4(k\u2212k\u2032) k for \u03ba = 0, \u03b4(l\u2212l\u2032)\n|\u03ba|l tanh(\u03c0l) for \u03ba < 0,\n(76)\ntogether with the time-dependent mode functions vk(t) and v\u2217k(t). Combining the latter statements, we find from the Klein-Gordon equation (61) the so-called mode equation\nv\u0308k(t) + 2 a\u0307(t)\na(t) v\u0307k(t)\u2212\nh(k) a2(t) vk(t) = 0. (77)\nFor given initial conditions at some point in time, one can determine vk(t) by solving Eq. (77). Note that the influence of the spatial curvature \u03ba is fully encoded in h(k). On the scales relevant for typical experiments, i.e. for\nR \u223c 10\u22125 m, h(k) turns out to be practically independent of the spatial curvature \u03ba for k/ \u221a n\u03040 & 0.1.\nThe mode functions are further constrained as a result of the canonical commutation relation (72), the orthonormality properties of the functions Hkm(u, \u03d5) (see [43]), and the bosonic commutation relations fulfilled by the creation and annihilation operators (76), leading to a normalization condition in terms of the Wronskian,\nWr[vk, v\u2217k] = a 2(t)~ [vkv\u0307\u2217k \u2212 v\u0307kv\u2217k] = i. (78)\nBy using (77) one can show that (78) is fulfilled at all times when it is fulfilled at one point in time.\nLet us note here that (77) is a second order differential equation, and (78) is just a single constraint, so that the mode functions vk(t) are not fixed completely. In fact, different choices of mode functions correspond to different choices of creation and annihilation operators, and they are related by Bogoliubov transformations. Note that the quantum field \u03c6 in (74) is independent of this choice. This is important to understand particle production, and will be discussed next."

Associated with this choice of mode functions are operators a\u0302km and a\u0302\u2020km that annihilate and create the corresponding phonons, and a \u201cvacuum\u201d state |\u2126\u3009 that has no such excitations,\na\u0302km |\u2126\u3009 = 0. (80)\nThe state |\u2126\u3009 describes the ground state of a (weakly interacting) Bose-Einstein condensate with no excitations. More generally, one may also take some other state as a starting point, for example with fixed temperature T .\nLet us now assume that at some time ti the scale factor a(t) becomes time dependent, until it becomes constant again at time tf. For the intermediate times ti < t < tf (called region II in the following), the mode functions are determined as solutions of equation (77), with initial conditions at t = ti set by continuity to the solution (79). We stress that for a time-dependent scale factor (in region II), the solution vk(t) obtained in this way will not be of the oscillatory form (79). As a consequence, the notions of vacuum states and (quasi)particles become more involved. Mathematically, this is related to the absence of a global timelike Killing vector field in that region, which would allow to define positive frequency waves.\n10\nI II IIIti tf t\n\u03bbf ai,\u03bbi af\na(t)\u03bb(t)\nFIG. 4. The time dependence of the scale factor a(t) (blue solid line) and the coupling \u03bb(t) (red dashed line) are shown for the three regions I, II and III. Up to ti, both are held constant, while they become time dependent in region II (the plot above correspond to a polynomial expansion with \u03b3 = 1/2, Q = m/n\u03040 = 1 and t0 = 0, setting all units to 1) this time dependence leads to particle production, observed in the stationary region III for t > tf.\nWe concentrate on an experimental procedure sketched in Fig. 4. Keeping in mind that the scale factor a(t) is controlled by the inverse coupling \u03bb(t) according to (33), one may first engineer certain initial values ai and \u03bbi in a time interval I up to ti. Then, the coupling \u03bb(t) is varied over time in time interval II, which simulates a FLRW universe with time-dependent scale factor a(t). Finally, the variation is stopped at tf = ti + \u2206t, corresponding to a stationary FLRW universe with scale factor af in time interval III.\nLet us then consider times t > tf where we assume that the scale factor is again constant, a(t) = af (region III). Here one can again find solutions of Eq. (77) in terms of modes with positive frequencies,\nuIIIk (t) = exp(\u2212i\u03c9IIIk t)\naf \u221a 2~\u03c9IIIk , (81)\nwhere now \u03c9IIIk = \u221a \u2212h(k)/af.

(82)\nIt is now important to note that the mode functions vk(t) obtained from extending the solution in region I to region II and then into region III will actually be a linear superposition of positive and negative frequency solutions, so that one can write\nuk = \u03b1kvk + \u03b2kv \u2217 k, vk = \u03b1 \u2217 kuk \u2212 \u03b2ku\u2217k, (83)\nwith the complex-valued and time-independent Bogoliubov coefficients \u03b1k and \u03b2k. From the normalization condition (78) applied to uk(t) follows that the coefficients need to satisfy |\u03b1k|2 \u2212 |\u03b2k|2 = 1. In terms of the Wronskian defined in (78) one has\n\u03b1k = Wr[uk, v\u2217k]/i, \u03b2k = \u2212Wr[uk, vk]/i. (84)\nFor completeness, we also mention the relation between the two sets of creation and annihilation operators,\nb\u0302km = \u03b1 \u2217 ka\u0302km \u2212 \u03b2\u2217k(\u22121)ma\u0302 \u2020 k,\u2212m. (85)\nIn particular it follows that the state |\u2126\u3009, which is initially a vacuum state in the sense of Eq. (80), is not an empty state with respect to the excitations annihilated by the operators b\u0302km. This is the essence of particle production due to a time dependent scale factor a(t).\nThe task is then to solve the mode equation (77) in all three regions I, II and III and to identify the Bogoliubov coefficients \u03b1k and \u03b2k through Eq. (84), from which all following quantities can be derived."

            "text": "To access the phenomenon of particle production experimentally, we introduce a rescaled density contrast\n\u03b4c(t, u, \u03d5) =\n\u221a n0(u)\nn\u030430 [n(t, u, \u03d5)\u2212 n0(u)] , (86)\nwhere n(t, u, \u03d5) = |\u03a6(t, u, \u03d5)|2 denotes the full condensate density, and n\u03040 is the density in the center of the trap. In this way, the rescaled density contrast is dimensionless, and using Eqs. (5) as well as (31) one has to leading order \u03b4c \u223c \u2202t\u03c6. Note here that for a box potential the given prefactor is constant, while for other trapping potentials, such as those put forward in Eq. (19), it has a substantial dependence on u in the outer regions of the trap.\nIn the following, we consider the equal time two-point correlation function of the rescaled density contrast after the expansion has ceased, t \u2265 tf, i.e.\nGnn(t;u, u\u2032, \u03d5, \u03d5\u2032) = \u3008\u03b4c(t, u, \u03d5)\u03b4c(t, u\u2032, \u03d5\u2032)\u3009 , (87)\nwhich is a typical observable in modern ultracold atom experiments. One can show that in leading order in fluctuating fields, where we can assume \u3008n(t, u, \u03d5)\u3009 = n0(u), the latter is proportional to the connected twopoint correlation function of time derivatives of fields\nGnn(t;u, u\u2032, \u03d5, \u03d5\u2032) = ~2m \u03bb2f n\u0304 3 0 G\u03c6\u0307\u03c6\u0307(t, L), (88)\nwhere\nG\u03c6\u0307\u03c6\u0307(t, L) = 1 2 \u3008{\u03c6\u0307(t, u, \u03d5), \u03c6\u0307(t, u\u2032, \u03d5\u2032)}\u3009c . (89)\nThe relation given in (88) is a result of the normalization chosen in (86).\nMoreover, as a consequence of the spatial homogeneity of FLRW universes, two-point correlation functions do not depend separately on the two spatial positions (u, \u03d5) and (u\u2032, \u03d5\u2032), but only on the comoving distance L between them,\n11\nL =  1\u221a |\u03ba| cos\u22121 (cos \u03b8 cos \u03b8\u2032 + sin \u03b8 sin \u03b8\u2032 cos(\u03d5\u2212 \u03d5\u2032)) for \u03ba > 0,[ u2 + u\u20322 \u2212 2uu\u2032 cos(\u03d5\u2212 \u03d5\u2032) ]1/2 for \u03ba = 0, 1\u221a |\u03ba| cosh\u22121 (cosh\u03c3 cosh\u03c3\u2032 \u2212 sinh\u03c3 sinh\u03c3\u2032 cos(\u03d5\u2212 \u03d5\u2032)) for \u03ba < 0, (90)\nand through (88) the observable defined in (86) acquires the symmetries of the FLRW universe,\nGnn(t;u, \u03d5, u\u2032, \u03d5\u2032) \u2261 Gnn(t, L). (91)\nWe proceed with the evaluation of this correlation function through (89) within the FLRW universe paradigm using the Bogoliubov transformations introduced in Sec. III B. This leads to\nGnn(t, L) = ~af n\u03040m \u222b k F(k, L) \u221a \u2212h(k)Sk(t), (92)\nwhere we introduced the spectrum of fluctuations\nSk(t) = 1\n2 +Nk + \u2206Nk(t), (93)\nas the momentum space representation of the rescaled density contrast two-point correlation function. Therein, we have the expected occupation number of phonon excitations per mode\nNk = \u3008\u2126| b\u0302\u2020km b\u0302km |\u2126\u3009 = |\u03b2k| 2, (94)\nand the time-dependent contribution \u2206Nk(t) = Re [ cke 2i\u03c9kt ] , (95)\nwherein\nck = \u2212(\u22121)m \u3008\u2126| b\u0302\u2020km b\u0302 \u2020 k,\u2212m |\u2126\u3009 = \u03b1k\u03b2k. (96)\nFurthermore, we used the abbreviation\n\u222b k =  \u2211\u221e l=0|\u03ba| l+1/2 2\u03c0 for \u03ba > 0,\u222b dk\n2\u03c0 k for \u03ba = 0,\u222b dl 2\u03c0 |\u03ba|l tanh(\u03c0l) for \u03ba < 0,\n(97)\nand the integration kernels\nF(k, L) =  Pl ( cos ( L \u221a |\u03ba| ))\nfor \u03ba > 0,\nJ0 (kL) for \u03ba = 0, Pil\u22121/2 ( cosh ( L \u221a |\u03ba| )) for \u03ba < 0, (98)\nfor the different spatial curvatures specified by \u03ba. We can rewrite the spectrum of fluctuations (93) using (95) and Euler\u2019s formula\nSk(t) = 1\n2 +Nk + |ck| cos (2\u03c9kt+ \u03b8k) , (99)\nwhere\n\u03b8k = Arg(ck) (100)\ndenotes the phase corresponding to the momentum mode k. It is useful to note at this point that Nk and \u2206Nk defined in (94) and (95) with the relations (84) are invariant under phase transformations on the mode functions vk(t)\u2192 ei\u03bbkvk(t), uk(t)\u2192 ei\u00b5kuk(t), if one also takes into account e2i\u03c9t \u2192 e\u22122i\u00b5ke2i\u03c9t in Eq. (95). These phases should not be observable. Also, following [54, 55] one can show that entanglement between modes with opposite wave numbers can be witnessed in the two-mode squeezed state of relevance whenever \u2206Nk > Nk. The latter was recently observed experimentally in [56] within a homogeneous two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate after quenching the time-dependent coupling \u03bb(t) to negative values and back. We leave a similar analysis within the FLRW universe paradigm for future work.\nMoreover, it is important to note that a two-point correlation function of fields as defined in (89) shows an ultraviolet divergence [3]. Consequently, the rescaled density contrast correlation function (92) has to be regularized. In the context of a Bose-Einstein condensate, a regularization arises naturally as the readout of the density contrast is limited by the precision of the measurement apparatus. Moreover, the acoustic approximation that we use here is a low momentum effective description that looses validity in the ultraviolet regime.\nTo solve this problem, which is well known in cosmology, one may work with smeared-out fields [57]\n\u03a6(t, r) = \u222b d2r\u2032W (r \u2212 r\u2032)\u03c6(t, r\u2032), (101)\nwith a window function W (r \u2212 r\u2032). The latter can be normalized according to\u222b\nd2r\u2032W (r\u2032) = 1. (102)\nIn momentum space, this window function plays the role of an ultraviolet regulator. We end up with a regularized expression for the rescaled density contrast correlation function\nGnn(t, L) = ~af n\u03040m \u222b k F(k, L) \u221a \u2212h(k)Sk(t)f\u0303G(k), (103)\nwhere f\u0303G(k) = W\u0303 \u2217(k)W\u0303 (k) corresponds to the absolute square of the Fourier transformed window function. In the following we work with a window function of Gaussian form in position space (as a function of the comoving distance), such that in the absence of spatial curvature\nf\u0303G(k) = W\u0303 \u2217(k)W\u0303 (k) = e\u2212w 2k2 .

This can be read out from the change in the shape of the spectrum in the first row of Fig. 5. It can also be seen that a decelerating expansion leads to slightly higher contrast in the spectrum compared to accelerating or uniform expansion. Furthermore, at large momenta, the spectrum converges to the ground state or \u201cvacuum\u201d expression. In the second row of Fig. 5 we show the manifestation of these features in position space, through the correlation function Gnn(t, L) given in (103). On top of a strong (diverging at L = 0) anticorrelation coming from features of the ground state or \u201cvacuum\u201d, we see an anticorrelation-correlation pair at finite distances. The magnitude of this pair of correlations decreases with slower expansion rates, and is highest for a decelerating scenario.\nThe evolution after expansion is given in the two lower rows of Fig. 5. After a simulated expansion, done by a 2 ms ramp, has ceased, the spectrum shifts to lower momenta, and oscillates in time for each k mode around Nk, with a period corresponding to the frequency of each mode. A node in the spectrum appears for a particular value of k which is not excited in the process of particle production (\u03b2k = 0). This precise feature is present only for the case of uniform expansion, and will be discussed further in Sec. IVD. Complementary, the position space evolution exhibits a decreasing magnitude of correlation-anticorrelation pair through time, along with a propagation to larger distances. In the short range we also see a correlation build up as a reaction to the expansion dynamics. The group of correlations propagates at twice the speed of sound (Eq. (27) at the center of the trap), as phonons travel away from each other. The chosen width for convolution (here w = 0.5\u00b5m) influences the shape of Gnn(t, L), but not the position of the peaks, with the only exception being the vacuum anticorrelation, which goes to L = 0 in the limit of vanishing width. Robust features with respect to changes of the width are discussed in Sec. IVE.\nB. Initial thermal state\nTogether with an initial thermal state comes about the phenomenon of stimulated particle production described in Sec. III D. Given the divergence of the statistical distribution (108) at low momenta, there is a large occupation of soft modes also after the expansion, in contrast with the outcome for vanishing initial temperature. Since stimulated particle production is present for any state above the ground state with T = 0, the study of this phenomenon is crucial when comparing to realistic experimental situations. On the other hand, the question arises whether the\n13\ninitial state in a concrete experiment is actually thermal.

(77)), spatial curvature enters in fact only through the eigenvalue spectrum. Here, the features of spatial curvature are equivalent to posing different boundary conditions on the eigenvalue equation, and do not go further than that. A further dependence on spatial curvature arises in the integral transform from momentum to position space (cf. Eq. (98)). As expected, the effect of curvature on the spectrum of fluctuations is often negligible, but can be tuned to a higher impact when decreasing the condensate radius.\nSomething similar happens to the rescaled density contrast, where differences are unimportant, even at small radii; this is shown in Fig. 7. In the presence of an initial thermal state this situation could change, given that the Bose-Einstein distribution (108) differs for different dispersion relations. In particular for negative curvature N ink is bounded at k = 0, as a consequence of an acquired gap in the dispersion relation.

As opposed to common literature, this correspondence was established starting from a nonrelativistic action and describing phononic excitations in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the fluctuations on top of the mean field. Furthermore, we investigated the phenomenon of particle production in momentum and in position space for various experimentally accessible scenarios. We showed that a suitably rescaled density contrast correlation function is to leading order proportional to a correlator within the FLRW universe paradigm. As a consequence of rescaling, spatial homogeneity and isotropy carried over to the density contrast correlation function. Looking into experimental feasibility, we have shown that the phases of momentum modes and the positions of maxima and minima in the correlation function serve as robust observables and are distinguishable for different dynamics in the scale factor. In future theoretical work it would be interesting to extend our approach from d = 2+1 to d = 3+1 dimensions, which should be straightforward. Also, one may want to study more general excitation fields, involving spin degrees of freedom, or modes with gaped excitation spectrum. Also a generalization to the full Bogoliubov spectrum beyond the acoustic approximation can be of interest for some questions. Another interesting direction could be to investigate other expansions specified by the scale parameter, allowing for a simulation of various epochs of expanding or contracting universes. In particular, one may study the de Sitter universe in the context of inflation or even a cyclic universe, probably exhibiting additional features such as parametric resonance.\nMoreover, one may investigate particle production from a quantum information theoretic perspective. More precisely, entanglement between modes of opposite momenta may be analyzed for spatially curved universes, extending the work of [54, 55]. Most importantly, it is of great interest to apply our methods to concrete ultra cold atoms experiments. In\n17\nparticular, as the rescaled density contrast correlation function serves as a typical observable, our work paves the ground to an extensive experimental investigation of particle production. We report on experimental confirmation of our proposal in [60]."
