    "abstractText": "Water pollution due to heavy metals has become a universal environmental problem. Ni(II) is a common heavy metal ion in polluted wastewater, which has high toxicity and carcinogenicity. In this study, the structure of a calcium-iron layered double hydroxide (Ca-Fe-LDHs) was synthesized and characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM and XPS. Then, Ni(II) ion was effectively removed by Ca-FeLDHs and its mechanism for this materials was described. The maximum adsorption capacity of Ni(II) for Ca-Fe-LDHs was 418.9 mg\u00b7g\u22121 when the initial concentration of Ni(II) was 1 g/L. The adsorption and removal of Ni(II) by Ca-Fe-LDHs was attributed to the action of hydroxyl groups on the hydrotalcite, generating surface capture. Ni(OH)2)0.75(H2O)0.16(NiCO3)0.09, Ni(OH)2, NiO, NiSO4 and other precipitates were generated on its surface. And a small amount of Ni-Fe-LDHs was generated through isomorphic transition before hydrolysis. Therefore, surface capture and isomorphic transition enhanced the removal efficiency of Ni(II) with Ca-Fe-LDHs, making Ca-FeLDHs as a potential material for effective removal of Ni(II).",

Ni(II) is a common heavy metal ion in polluted wastewater, which has high toxicity and carcinogenicity. In this study, the structure of a calcium-iron layered double hydroxide (Ca-Fe-LDHs) was synthesized and characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM and XPS. Then, Ni(II) ion was effectively removed by Ca-FeLDHs and its mechanism for this materials was described. The maximum adsorption capacity of Ni(II) for Ca-Fe-LDHs was 418.9 mg\u00b7g\u22121 when the initial concentration of Ni(II) was 1 g/L. The adsorption and removal of Ni(II) by Ca-Fe-LDHs was attributed to the action of hydroxyl groups on the hydrotalcite, generating surface capture. Ni(OH)2)0.75(H2O)0.16(NiCO3)0.09, Ni(OH)2, NiO, NiSO4 and other precipitates were generated on its surface. And a small amount of Ni-Fe-LDHs was generated through isomorphic transition before hydrolysis. Therefore, surface capture and isomorphic transition enhanced the removal efficiency of Ni(II) with Ca-Fe-LDHs, making Ca-FeLDHs as a potential material for effective removal of Ni(II).\nKEYWORDS\nheavy metal, calcium-iron layered double hydroxide, nickel ions, isomorphic transition, mechanism\n1 Introduction\nWater pollution, especially heavy metal pollution has become an environmental problem concerned by the public. Chemical industry, electroplating, printing and dyeing, pharmaceutical and metallurgical industries can generate lots of heavy metal wastewater, which brings seriously threat to human health. Ni(II) is a common heavy metal ion in polluted wastewater, which is highly toxic and carcinogenic. Excessive intake of Nickel can damage brain, spinal cord and human internal organs (Li et al., 2017a). Besides, heavy Ni(II) pollution in water and soil will destroy the ecosystem and directly cause the reduction of crops and aquatic products (Lan et al., 2019). Therefore, it is necessary to take"

The removal of Ni(II) ion from water has been widely concerned by scholars in the world. At present, the treatment technology of Ni(II) ion from heavy metal wastewater can be divided into chemical method (Li et al., 2009; Fu and Wang, 2010; Dong et al., 2011), biological method (Wen et al., 2018; Yu and Jiang, 2019) and physicochemical method (Cai et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2019) according to the treatment principle. The physicochemical method is widely used by combining physical and chemical effects to reduce the concentration of heavy metal ions in wastewater, so as to meet the discharge standard (Ghasemi and Rohani, 2019). Besides, the physicochemical method can achieve the recovery and utilization of heavy metal ions from wastewater.\nHydrotalcite compounds were often used to treat contamination of heavy metal ion. Hydrotalcite compounds, also known as layered double hydroxide (LDH), are a new kind of layered functional materials with brucite structure. The general chemical formula of hydrotalcite compounds was [M2+1\u2212xM3+x (OH)2]x+(An\u2212x/n).yH2O. Where M2+ and M3+ represented the bivalent and trivalent metal cations that comprise the laminates, and An\u2212 represented the guest anions between the main laminates. M2+ was a divalent metal cation such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+. The M3+ was a trivalent metal cation such as Al3+ and Fe3+. An\u2212 was referred to CO3 2-, PO4 3-, SO4 2-, Cl\u2212, OH\u2212, NO3 \u2212 and other inorganic and organic ions as well as some complex ions (Wang and O\u2019Hare, 2012). All kinds of divalent and trivalent metals can be incorporated into the framework of LDH. In addition, a complete LDH structure can be obtained when the mole ratio of M2+/M3+ was between 2 and 4, that was, the x value was between 0.2 and 0.33. Huang et al. synthesized Mg2Al-TCAS-LDHs and Zn2Al-TCAS-LDHs composite materials arranging between different TCAS layers to study the adsorption performance of TCAS-LDHS composite materials for toxic heavy metal ions. The maximum adsorption capacity of two kinds of TCAS-LDHS composite materials for Pb2+ were 205 mg\u00b7g\u22121 and 188.1 mg\u00b7g\u22121, while, the maximum adsorption capacity of two kinds of TCAS-LDHS composite materials for Cu2+ were 125 mg\u00b7g\u22121 and 103.8 mg\u00b7g\u22121 (Huang et al., 2016). Roozbeh et al. prepared functionalized Ni50Co50LDHs/UIO-66-(Zr)-(COOH)2 nanocomposites and used to remove Hg2+ and Ni2+ from wastewater solution. It was found that the adsorption capacity of Hg2+ and Hg2+ was as high as 509.8 mg\u00b7g\u22121 and 441.0 mg\u00b7g\u22121 (Soltani et al., 2021). However, due to the greenness of the material and the complicated synthesis methods, the further exploration was needed.\nControlling the chemical composition of inorganic layer cations and interlayer space anions in LDH, the unique structure and functional properties can be precisely regulated. Due to its unique interlayer structure and interlayer anion exchangability, LDH has a good application in removing heavy metal nickel. The main function of heavy metal\nremoval include M(OH)X, aggregation on the surface of LDHs through precipitation, isomer substitution, bonding with -OH on the surface of LDHs, and chelation with functional ligands on the plate (Li et al., 2022).\nConsidering heavy metals captured from a complex water environment, the selective adsorbent of FeMgAl extracted from layered double hydroxide (LDH) with different intercalated anions (CO3 2-, NO3 \u2212, and MoS4 2-), and adsorbed Ni2+ ions were compared. The result showed that an isothermal optimized maximum adsorption amount of Fe-MoS4 was 369.0 mg g \u22121 (Ali et al., 2019). The chloride and heavy metal binding capacity of the hydrotalc-like phases formed in the binder were examined (Yang et al., 2020). The results showed that the binder had a higher antichloride ion permeability than silicate cement and other alkaliactivated slag paste. When the binder dosage was 10%, the solidification efficiency of the Pb2+, Cu2+, and Cr3+ ions in the binder was between 66% and 88%. This study provided a guidance for the production of green binders for industrial solid waste treatment. The above hydroslide has made some progress in Ni2+ adsorption, but its adsorption effect can not be shown, and the influence of Ca-Fe-LDH adsorption on Ni2+ has not been explored.\nAccording to the strength of metal KOH > Ca(OH)2 > NaOH > Mg(OH)2, LDH has a strong alkalinity, but the apparent alkalinity is small. The acidity of LDH is related to the alkalinity of the divalent metal hydroxide, the acidity of the trivalent metal hydroxide and the interlayer anion. The basic strength is consistent with that of divalent metal hydroxide, so Ca2+ is selected. In addition, due to the structure and chemical properties of Ca2+, Fe3+, Fe2+, Co2+ and Ni2+, isomorphic substitution is easy to occur (Liang et al., 2013). However, due to a series of problems such as secondary pollution caused by the application of Co2+ and harsh experimental conditions of Fe2+, Ca2+ and Fe3+ are finally determined to construct the unique interlayer structure of hydrotalcite.\nTherefore, this study mainly focused on the preparation and characterization of Ca-Fe bimetallic hydroxide composite materials, and the preparation of layered double hydroxide composite materials was carried out by co-precipitation method to improve the selectivity and removal efficiency of nickel ion. Recovery experiments of nickel ion was conducted to explore the mechanism of adsorption of Ni2+ ion by LDH and the removal model of Ni2+ ion was established."

In the Ca-Fe-LDHS spectrum, the strong overlap band at 3515 cm\u22121 was attributed to the tensile vibration of the structural hydroxyl group (O-H) between the Ca-Fe-LDHs interlayers and lattice water. The deformation of Cl\u2212 in Ca-Fe-Cl interlayer was about 989 cm\u22121. The peak at 493 cm\u22121 was attributed to the stretching vibration of M-O (M: Ca or Fe) and Ca-Fe-O in the lattice (Ifebajo et al., 2019).

As shown in Table 3, compared with the maximum adsorption capacity of some reported adsorbents, Ca-Fe-LDHs also showed an excellent adsorption capacity for Ni(II)."

The FTIR spectra showed a dissolution of LDH, as the bands of H-O-H decreased at 3,500\u20133,650 cm\u22121. It showed that a peak at about 3,416 cm\u22121 was attributed to the broad band vibration of hydrolyzed H-CaF-LDH hydroxylation (\u2212OH), and the peak at about 1,114 cm\u22121 was the broad shoulder band spectrum of SO4 2\u2212, which proved that SO4 2\u2212 was absorbed in the simulated wastewater produced with Ni2SO4 as raw material. The Cl \u2212 characteristic\nspectrum at 874 cm\u22121 was weakened, indicating that SO4 2\u2212 or CO32\u2212 had been replaced. The oscillating band at 712 cm\u22121 was a ferric hydroxide structure, which was the main component of the residual solid after the release of some Ca2+during the hydrolysis of LDH, indicating that the dissolution of LDH led to the formation of calcium-containing or ferric nickel hydroxide (Ni/Ca-FeOH). However, there was a strong peak at 1424 cm\u22121, which proved that CO3 2- existed in the adsorbed material."

Besides, the content of Ni(II) was 10.61% and the rate of Ni/Fe was 13.85, which was much higher than the content of Fe3+ and Ca2+, indicating that the surface adsorption was greater than the ion exchange, which was consistent with the previous result. SEM analysis was carried out on the Ca-Fe-LDHs material after the adsorption of Ni(II) ions by Ca-Fe-LDHs and shown in Figure 11. It could be clearly seen that the outer layer structure of the material was wrapped by some substances in the state of microspheres, which was attributed to the adsorption of Ni(II) ions.

            "text": "In order to determine the ability of the Ca-Fe-LDHs to absorb the Ni (II) ions, we further characterized the samples\nusing XPS. Basic information of XPS for Ca-Fe-LDHs after adsorption was shown in Table 4. As shown in Figure 12A, the key elements such as Ca, Ni, Fe, Cl, O and S were observed, indicating that the SO4 2\u2212 was absorbed. From the mass content analysis, the area ratio of Ni/Fe/Ca was about 100:4:1. According to XRD, the hydrolysis effect was relatively obvious, so the Fe content was less and the sharp decrease of Ca indicated that Ni(II) replacing Ca(II), resulting in a sharp decrease in the content. As shown in Figure 12B, Cl 2p showed a peak at 198.7 eV, demonstrating the presence of Cl\u2212. As shown in Figure 12C, the peaks of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 were located at 713.3 eV and 724 eV, respectively, indicating the oxidation state of Fe3+. Similarly, as shown in Figure 12D, the peaks of Ca 2p3/2 and Ca 2p1/2 were located at 346.8 eV and 350.5 eV, respectively, reflecting the presence of Ca2+ oxidation state, and the main adsorption was that Fe-O interacted with the surface hydroxyl group. As shown in Figure 12E, the peaks of Ni 2P3/2, Ni 2P3/2, Ni 2P1/2, and Ni 2P1/2 were located in 856.2 eV, 861.6 eV, 873.5 eV and 879.9 eV, respectively, indicating the generation of Ni(OH)2, Ni-O, NiOOH, etc. The formation of Ni (II) indicated the presence of various types of Ni (II) on the surface, which was closely related to the distribution of adsorbed oxygen and the -OH structure in the hydrotalc form. As shown in Figure 12F, the 533.34 eV, 531.63 eV, 530.82 eV in O1s were the peaks of lattice oxygen (Ni-O), surface hydroxyl (OH) and adsorbed oxygen (Ni-O), and the hydroxyl group was more abundant than the adsorption oxygen content, indicating that most of them were combined with the hydroxyl group to produce chemical adsorption. The formation of the lattice oxygen (Ni-O) indicated that a small amount of the Ni had synthesized the new Ni-Fe-LDHs."

            "text": "LDHs showed a good adsorption performance on heavy metal ions due to the ability of exchange and adsorption for ions between layers, so it was used to develop materials for adsorption of various heavy metal ions. In general, for common heavy metal cations, LDHs removed heavy metal cations through the following mechanisms, including the formation of surface sediments, such as oxides, hydroxides, carbonates. Ions adsorption was achieved by surface hydroxyl bonding with LDH, isocrystalline replacement, and bonding with functional ligands in the sandwich medium. In addition, cation exchange (isocrystalline replacement) as a non-specific adsorption, was difficult to occur during low concentration adsorption (Li et al., 2017b; Yu et al., 2018).\nIn the adsorption experiment, large number of hydroxyl groups on the surface of Ca-Fe-LDHs provided a high\nFrontiers in Chemistry frontiersin.org10\nadsorption capacity for Ni(II). At the same time, the intensity of hydroxyl peak decreased after adsorption, indicating that Ni(II) and its hydrolysate were involved in hydroxyl interaction on Ca-Fe-LDHs surface. In addition, according to FTIR spectra, Ca ions could undergo isomorphic mass exchange reaction and ion exchange with Ni(II) during the adsorption process (Kucukcongar et al., 2020). The removal mechanism of Ni(II) using Ca-Fe-LDHs was shown in Figure 13, Although the hydrolysis of Ca-FeLDHs occurred, its electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding might be the driving forces of the adsorption process due to hydrolysis. Moreover, it could also be seen from a series of results that the adsorption removal of Ni(II) mainly depended on isothermal mass exchanging and surface capturing. The results of XPS and SEM showed that the effect of surface capturing was much stronger than isothermal mass exchanging. This was because the synthesis of Ni-Fe-LDHs needed to be carried out in a certain alkaline environment. Because Ni(OH)2 precipitation would occur under alkaline conditions, and it was impossible to judge the adsorption effect of hydrotalcite, so the ion exchange precipitation was not ideal. However, the unique structure of hydrotalcite enabled its surface capturing to achieve a strong effect."

After the treatment of Ni(II) wastewater using Ca-Fe-LDHs materials, the maximum adsorption capacity of Ni(II) ions by Ca-Fe-LDHs was 418.9 mg\u00b7g\u22121 within 3 h. The results showed that Ni(II) ions wasmore adsorbed on the surface\nof hydrotalcite and reacted with hydroxyl group. However, in the experiments of Ni(II) adsorption by Ca-Fe-LDHs, it was found that Ca-Fe-LDHs was hydrolyzed and only a small amount of Ni-FeLDHs structure was found. Therefore, isomorphic transformation and surface capture were attributed to the Ni(II) adsorption during the removal process of Ni(II) ions using Ca-Fe-LDHs, among which surface capture was the main adsorption mode."
