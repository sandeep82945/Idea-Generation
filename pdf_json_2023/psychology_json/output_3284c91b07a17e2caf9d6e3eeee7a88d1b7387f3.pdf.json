Silylenes have been widely explored for the formation of transition metal complexes.2 In contrast, the subject of main group metals with silylene or bis(silylene) adducts are not extensively explored. Intrinsically group 13 compounds possess Lewis acidity. Silylene is reported to form Lewis acid\u2013base adducts with organoboron compounds. A number of literature reports on silylene-boron adducts are well documented.3\u201310\nIn comparison with silylene-boron adducts, reports on silylene-aluminum, silylene-gallium, and silylene-indium are rare (Fig. 1).

However, the reports of the Lewis acid\u2013base adducts based on the silylene or bis(silylene) are limited.\nIn this report, we reduced the silylene LSiCl with an equivalent amount of KC8 in the presence of half equivalent of bulky and sterically hindered cyclopentadienyl Cp\u2032\u2032\u2032MCl2 (M = Al or Ga) to afford interesting Lewis acid\u2013base adducts \u03b71-Cp\u2032\u2032\u2032 M(Cl2) \u2190 Si(L)-SiL. To confirm the formation of this type of novel Lewis acid\u2013base adducts, bis(silylene) LSi-SiL was treated with equivalent amounts of Cp\u2032\u2032\u2032AlI2 to get \u03b71-Cp\u2032\u2032\u2032Al(I2) \u2190 Si (L)-SiL.

However, the two Si atoms are in an oxidation state I, this is a very rare situation. In the Lewis acid part, the Al atom adopts a four-coordinate oxidation state III. The Al2\u2013Si2 (2.5413(9) \u00c5) bond length is significantly longer than the reported Al\u2013Si covalent bond in compounds [LAlHSiH2Mes]2 (2.4602(8) \u00c5)\n11 and LAl(SiH2SiH2)2AlL (2.4473 (9)\u20132.4545(9) \u00c5).11 Furthermore, other selected examples with Si\u2013Al bonds are mentioned in brackets (F (2.487(1) \u00c5),14 NacnacAlHSiH2Ph (2.4522(8) \u00c5), and NacnacAlHSiHMePh (2.4548(7) \u00c5)).22 However, the Al\u2013Si coordination bond length which is reported in the following examples is longer in LSi (AlMe3)-Si(AlMe3)L (2.5921(7) and 2.5799(8) \u00c5),\n11 [PhC (NiPr)2]2Si \u2192 AlPh3 (2.5293(14) \u00c5) and [C(N\niPr)3]2Si \u2192 AlPh3 (2.5544(17) \u00c5).4b This indicates that the Al\u2013Si bond in compound 1 is a coordination bond. The Si1\u2013Si2 bond length is 2.4244(10) \u00c5, which is longer than the corresponding compound in LSi-SiL (2.413(2) \u00c5),20 LSi(AlMe3)-Si(AlMe3)L (2.3937 (7) \u00c5),11 and LSi(M)-Si(M)L (M = Ir, 2.376(5) \u00c5; M = Rh, 2.388 (2) \u00c5).23 Since only Si2 in LSi-SiL is coordinated with Al from the Cp\u2032\u2032\u2032Al(Cl2), the Si\u2013N bond lengths and the N\u2013Si\u2013N bond angles in the two amidinato silicon four-membered rings are different. The Si2\u2013N bond length (Si2\u2013N3 1.8295(11) \u00c5, Si2\u2013N4 1.8522(11) \u00c5) are shorter than Si1\u2013N (Si1\u2013N1 1.8667(12) \u00c5, Si1\u2013 N2 1.8691(11) \u00c5), which makes the bond angle N3\u2013Si2\u2013N4 (71.08(5)\u00b0) to be slightly bigger than N1\u2013Si1\u2013N2 (69.50(5)\u00b0). It is also noteworthy that the Cp\u2032\u2032\u2032AlCl2 changes from \u03b75 to \u03b71.\nTo confirm the formation of Lewis acid\u2013base adduct, we also tried the reaction of bis(silylene) LSi-SiL with Cp\u2032\u2032\u2032AlI2 at room temperature overnight, and then isolated the light yellow crystals \u03b71-Cp\u2032\u2032\u2032Al(I2) \u2190 Si(L)-SiL (2) in the yield of 45% (Scheme 1). The 1H NMR spectrum of 2 shows four singlets at \u03b4 1.21, 1.42, 1.66, and 1.76 ppm for the tBu of amidinato and cyclopentadienyl ligand. One broad resonance at \u03b4 6.88\u20136.95 ppm for cyclopentadienyl, two broad resonances at \u03b4 6.97\u20137.06 and 7.20\u20137.25 ppm for phenyl protons. The 29Si NMR shows two resonances at 47.8 and 54.4 ppm for the two Si atoms in compound 2, which shift to up-field in comparison to compound 1 (49.2 and 57.0 ppm) and the starting material bis(silylene) (76.3 ppm).\n2 crystallizes isostructurally to 1 (Fig. 3) in the triclinic space group P1\u0304 with one molecule and two toluene solvent molecules. Due to the larger radius of the two iodine atoms connected to Al in the Lewis acid part, the bond lengths of Al\u2013 Si (2.5505(9) \u00c5) and Si\u2013Si (2.4399(8) \u00c5) are both slightly longer than those in compound 1, while all other features mentioned above for 1 are identical.\nTo further elaborate the formation of Lewis acid\u2013base adduct, we repeated the reaction of LSiCl with equivalent amounts of KC8 and 0.25 equivalents of [\u03b71-Cp\u2032\u2032\u2032Ga(\u00b5-Cl)Cl]2 in toluene at \u221278 \u00b0C. From this reaction we obtained as a Lewis acid\u2013base adduct \u03b71-Cp\u2032\u2032\u2032Ga(Cl2) \u2190 Si(L)-SiL (3) as colorless crystals in 65% yield. The 1H NMR spectrum of 3 shows two singlets at \u03b4 1.25 ppm and 1.37 ppm for the tBu of amidinato ligand, two singlets at \u03b4 1.63 ppm and 1.72 ppm for the tBu of cyclopentadienyl ligand. One broad resonance at \u03b4 6.81\u20136.87 ppm for cyclopentadienyl, two broad resonances at \u03b4\n6.92\u20137.01, 7.10\u20137.13, and 7.22\u20137.24 ppm for phenyl protons. The 29Si NMR shows two resonances at 41.1 and 54.7 ppm for the two Si atoms with the different chemical environments in compound 3, which also shift to up-field in comparison to the aluminum compound 1 and starting material bis(silylene) (76.3 ppm).\nCompound 3 crystallizes again isostructurally to 1 (Fig. 4) in the triclinic space group P1\u0304, however with two molecules and four toluene solvent molecule in the asymmetric unit. Interestingly, the dimer gallium [\u03b71-Cp\u2032\u2032\u2032Ga(\u00b5-Cl)Cl]2 was split into the monomers Cp\u2032\u2032\u2032GaCl2 by the bis(silylene) to form compound 3. In the Lewis acid part, the Ga atom is four-coordinated in oxidation state III. The Si2\u2013Ga1 bond length (2.4910(7) \u00c5) is longer than those in adducts of G (2.438(1) and 2.452(1) \u00c5),15 H (2.3963(17) \u00c5),16 and I (2.3904(6) \u00c5),5a but\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023 Dalton Trans., 2023, 52, 6175\u20136179 | 6177\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .
