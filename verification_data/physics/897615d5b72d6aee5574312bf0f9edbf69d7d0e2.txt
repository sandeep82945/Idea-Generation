"In this work, we tuned the deformability by changing both bending and stretching moduli. Further, we will investigate the assembly of deformable capsomers around cargo such as nanoparticles or polyions [38]. Extending the deformable capsomer model to probe the link between capsomer deformability and the disassembly of viruses [52,53] will also be a subject of future work."
