 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading the paper:

1. Incorporate an orbital environment from STK tools into the PyBullet simulation to better emulate the microgravity and orbital mechanics involved in rendezvous and docking maneuvers. This could lead to more realistic simulations. 

2. Explore the use of different control schemes like adaptive control or reinforcement learning for the trajectory planning and control of the space robot system. This could improve performance in uncertain environments.

3. Test the system with additional sensors like LIDAR for more robust pose estimation and proximity operations. This could improve autonomy and enable operations in cluttered environments. 

4. Expand the experiments to include non-cooperative targets with various shapes, sizes and dynamics. This would demonstrate versatility for active debris removal missions. 

5. Integrate a flexible manipulator arm to expand the capability from rigid body docking to soft docking scenarios. This could enable safer and more resilient docking for refueling and maintenance tasks.
