    "abstractText": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a preclinical stage of dementia and has a higher risk of progression to dementia than controls of the same age (Frederiksen et al., 2021). In China, the rising frequency of MCI is becoming a major public health concern, with approximately 15.54% of Chinese seniors over the age of 60 suffering from MCI (Jia et al., 2020). Despite the absence of a fatal hazard for a short time, the MCI state\u2019s effects on an individual\u2019s cognitive function, mood, physical function, and quality of life can result in a general decline in the patient\u2019s physical and mental health, as well as a significantly increased risk of developing other diseases (Anderson, 2019).

Taking\npatients\u2019 preferences into account can improve the self-management\nsituation. The purpose of this study is to look into MCI patients\u2019 preferences\nfor self-management in China.\nMethods: A qualitative research was conducted using semi-structured in-depth interviews with 21 patients recently diagnosed with MCI who were\nchosen by purposive sampling. These interviews were analyzed through\nthematic analysis and identified emerging themes.\nResults: Five themes of self-management preference were identified: (1) Preference for acquiring disease knowledge; (2) Preference for participating\nin drug therapy; (3) Preference for participating in exercise; (4) Preference\nfor applying memory compensation strategy; (5) Preferences for emotional\nexpression and response.\nConclusion: Our study identified the specific preferences of MCI patients in China for the main self-management items. The findings are valuable insights\nfor knowing MCI patients\u2019 self-management content and preferences and\nprovide better guidance for health practitioners to improve self-management\ncompliance.\nKEYWORDS\ncognitive dysfunction, self-management, patient preference, qualitative research, China\nIntroduction\nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a preclinical stage of dementia and has a higher risk of progression to dementia than controls of the same age (Frederiksen et\u00a0al., 2021). In China, the rising frequency of MCI is becoming a major public health concern, with approximately 15.54% of Chinese seniors over the age of 60 suffering from MCI (Jia et\u00a0al., 2020). Despite the absence of a fatal hazard for a short time, the MCI state\u2019s effects on an individual\u2019s cognitive function, mood, physical function, and quality of life can result in a general decline in the patient\u2019s physical and mental health, as well as a significantly increased risk of developing other diseases (Anderson, 2019).

Yet at the same time, MCI remains a chronic condition, it is critical to explore how to design a more sustainable management approach (Petersen et\u00a0al., 2018).\nThe Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) has published an article describing the paradigm shift in chronic illness treatment during the 1980s\u2014from conventional patient education centered on information transfer to fostering patients\u2019 self-management. It places a premium on patient-centeredness, emphasizing the individual\u2019s responsibility and ability to sustain health and cope with illness (Bodenheimer et\u00a0 al., 2002). Subsequently, the concept of patient-centered care was widely proposed. Scholl et\u00a0al. sorted out the patient-centered principles, patient-centered activities, and enabling factors through a systematic review (Scholl et\u00a0al., 2014). Studies have also shown that patient-centered care has a positive relationship with patient satisfaction, happiness, and other indicators (Rathert et\u00a0al., 2013). Meanwhile, patient-centered self-management has been shown to boost patients\u2019 awareness of their illness and their self-efficacy. It may help patients physically and psychologically and enhance their quality of life, clinical results, and access to health care (Quinn et\u00a0 al., 2016). With the advancement of cognitive impairment research, it has been shown that people with MCI may manage their health despite cognitive impairment (Lee et\u00a0al., 2019).\nHowever, individuals with mild cognitive impairment often have difficulty completing established self-management tasks. Patients are at risk of neglecting the importance of selfmanagement due to attributing the disease to uncontrollable factors such as age or lacking confidence in their ability to manage (Santos et\u00a0al., 2018; Cheng et\u00a0al., 2021). In addition, even when patients complete self-management tasks during the intervention program, it is difficult for them to continue self-management without supervision from professionals or caregivers after finishing interventions. Tak et\u00a0al. (2012) revealed that only less than one-fifth of the patients maintained compliance with the selfmanagement after the tasks were completed. Based on the above, it is notable that MCI patients\u2019 self-management situation is not optimistic.\nPatients will be\u00a0 more motivated and benefit from selfmanagement for longer if treatments are customized to their needs and preferences (Trappenburg et\u00a0al., 2013). According to prior studies, when promoting self-management through peer support for patients with chronic diseases, it may only be\u00a0beneficial if it is consistent with the personal preferences of the patient with chronic diseases, i.e., if the patient is willing to engage in peer support (Been-Dahmen et\u00a0 al., 2017; O'Connell et\u00a0 al., 2021). Evaluating patient self-management preferences also helps healthcare personnel give more individualized self-management support (SMS; O'Connell et\u00a0 al., 2021). While MCI patients\u2019 cognitive function is moderately compromised, they can communicate their daily care preferences (Feinberg and Whitlatch, 2002). Some researchers believe that MCI patients\u2019 selfmanagement material and style should be\u00a0tailored to their needs\nand preferences (Bensadon and Odenheimer, 2013). It could help patients gain self-management skills, better adapt to their needs, and receive tailored and participative counseling (Yu et\u00a0al., 2017). Several studies have examined MCI patients\u2019 preferences for medical care, focusing on treatment options and outcomes. Due to memory loss and lack of peers, MCI patients prefer choosing easy, safe, maneuverable, and group-cooperation treatments (Smith et\u00a0 al., 2018). For patients and their families, the most important outcome of care is quality of life, followed by selfcontrol or coping skills for memory impairment (Chong et\u00a0al., 2014). In addition to this, some patients with cognitive impairment exhibit more altruism, which may influence treatment decisions (Wehrmann et\u00a0 al., 2020). However, research on other selfmanagement tasks and content is lacking.\nThere are few studies on MCI patients\u2019 self-management preferences. The purpose of this study is to synthesize a list of selfmanagement tasks for MCI patients through a literature review and to use this list as a framework for qualitative research to gain insight into patients\u2019 thoughts and preferences for selfmanagement content."

The study was approved by the Nanjing Medical University Ethics Committee (2021-No. 648) and was conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki.\nCorbin and Strauss proposed a model of chronic disease selfmanagement in a seminal report, stating that the core tasks of chronic disease self-management include three categories: medical management, role management, and emotion management (Corbin and Strauss, 1988; Begum et\u00a0al., 2022).

The main diagnostic criteria: cognitive impairment reported by the patient or informant or observed by an experienced clinician; Objective evidence of impairment in one or more cognitive domains such as memory, executive function, language, visuospatial function (from neuropsychological testing); independent activities of daily\nliving function; A diagnosis of dementia has not been reached. (2) Primary school education level or above. (3) The ability to communicate and hear is acceptable, and patients can cooperate with us during the interview. Exclusion criteria: (1) People with severe physical diseases or mental disorders. (2) Refusing to accept the interview or sign the informed consent. (3) Patients who are participating in other studies or drug trials. We\u00a0cooperated with neurological physicians and neuropsychological measurement researchers to jointly identify patient eligibility criteria for MCI.

Fourteen participants have retired and the remaining were at work. Participants were interviewed for an average of 37 min, with a duration of 24-78 min. We\u00a0conducted neuropsychological testing on participants and mainly presented the scores of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein et\u00a0al., 1975) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scales (MoCA; Nasreddine et\u00a0al., 2005), which can represent the overall cognitive status of patients. It is particularly important for the diagnosis of MCI. In addition, the scores of the Activity of Daily Living Scale (ADL; Lawton and Brody, 1969) were also presented to assist diagnosis and understand the basic living conditions of the participants. Patients had an average MMSE score of 25 (range 21\u201330), MoCA had an average score of 18 (range 11\u201323), and ADL had an average score of 14 (range 14\u201315).

            "text": "Our study investigated the self-management needs and preferences of patients with MCI based on the chronic disease self-management model. Through literature review, we\u00a0extensively supplemented the specific self-management tasks of patients with MCI under medical management, role management, and emotional management in the model, to have a more comprehensive understanding of the scope of self-management tasks of patients with MCI. Subsequently, we\u00a0 developed the interview outline under the guidance of the chronic disease selfmanagement model and common self-management tasks of MCI patients and carried out qualitative research, which was normative and guaranteed the reliability of the results. Finally, we\u00a0found that MCI patients had a strong willingness to participate in the five self-management tasks, including acquiring disease knowledge, participating in drug therapy, exercising, applying memory compensation strategy, and emotional expression and response.\nThese preferences for specific contents were characteristic and diverse.\nOur qualitative findings indicated that MCI patients\u2019 preferences for disease knowledge acquisition manifested themselves in two ways. In terms of disease knowledge, patients with MCI obtained it by consulting professional physicians, utilizing multiple network paths such as television, mobile phones, and computers, and communicating with other patients or friends. In terms of disease knowledge content, patients identified three critical components as treatment plans, prognosis, and home health guidance. MCI symptoms are often a sign of normal aging rather than a disease. Patients often choose to seek medical help to obtain relevant disease knowledge (Dai et\u00a0al., 2013) when they have obvious and unexplained cognitive changes. We\u00a0also found that utilizing multiple network paths is also an important way for MCI patients to acquire disease-related knowledge. With the intellectual development of modern society, conducting diseaserelated searching is becoming more popular in China. Despite their lack of technical knowledge, patients with MCI can increase their health knowledge if taught that the Internet can meet their disease management needs and given guidance and training (Klimova, 2017). However, given the complexity and variable quality of disease information available on the Internet, it is necessary to teach patients how to obtain scientifically accurate information about their disease. As a result, it is critical to provide consistent network resources and diverse information support to MCI patients during their health education. Furthermore, memory clinics for MCI patients, even in China, can only provide preliminary disease diagnosis and medication guidance, whereas patients prefer to learn about disease prognosis and treatment options (Palazzo et\u00a0al., 2021). As Dai also pointed out (Dai et\u00a0al., 2013), we\u00a0 discovered a gap between doctor-provided health services and patient preferences for disease knowledge. Patients\u2019 capacity for self-management and subjective initiative is contingent upon their knowledge of the disease. Thus, when diagnosing and treating patients, healthcare workers must provide patients with sufficient disease information that corresponds to their preferences.\nAs a chronic disease, the primary treatment for MCI is always medications, no matter in the clinical application or the patients\u2019 treatment preferences, which is a relatively common \u201cclinical inertia\u201d (Phillips et\u00a0 al., 2001). Currently, there is no proven, effective drug for MCI patients. Cholinesterase inhibitors are the commonly used drugs in clinical practice. However, there is no high-quality long-term research to prove its benefits in cognitive functions and it has apparent side effects. The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) recommends that these drugs not be\u00a0used for MCI treatment (Petersen et\u00a0al., 2018). There is a contradiction between patients\u2019 high dependency on drugs and the lack of recommended medication for MCI. Meanwhile, our study only found that the MCI patients\u2019 preference is long-term drug therapy but failed to find patients\u2019 concrete preferences on drug dose, cost, effectiveness, safety and other aspects. This could be\u00a0related to the patients in our study who were recently diagnosed with and were\nFrontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org\nunfamiliar with the specific treatment drugs and regimens. The development of new drugs and drug trials are essential for cognitive impairment. However, our findings indicate that the majority of MCI patients in China are averse to participating in drug trials, even though we\u00a0have informed these patients about the risks associated with drug trials. This will affect future drug research and development. On the one hand, they are worried about the security of the new drugs. On the other hand, the fact that MCI has no effect on a patient\u2019s daily life significantly reduces the need for risky treatment. Thus, medication for MCI creates a vicious circle.\nExercise is an important protective factor and intervention mode for patients with MCI (Livingston et\u00a0al., 2020). Guidelines and consensus in different countries emphasize the importance of exercise intervention (Petersen et\u00a0al., 2018; Dunne et\u00a0al., 2021; Frederiksen et\u00a0 al., 2021), and multiple clinical studies have confirmed the beneficial effect of exercise on cognition, body and emotion in patients with MCI (Ellis et\u00a0al., 2019; Song and Yu, 2019). However, exercise interventions do have some drawbacks. For instance, exercise programs vary considerably, and patient compliance with exercise interventions varies significantly. As a result, it is critical to ascertain the exercise preferences of MCI patients. Our study discovered that one of the barriers to exercise for MCI patients is a lack of companions, and they preferred team sports, a finding that is consistent with Chong\u2019s (Chong et\u00a0al., 2014). Patients also have a need for exercise safety and prefer to engage in more secure activities. Health complaints have been identified as a significant barrier to participation in physical activities, particularly moderate to vigorous outdoor exercise, for patients with cognitive impairment (Chong et\u00a0 al., 2020). It corroborates our assertions. Additionally, given the decline in memory function in MCI patients, performing simple exercise patterns in an accessible environment is necessary, as complex exercise imposes greater cognitive demands (Chong et\u00a0al., 2021). However, we\u00a0discovered that some relatively young MCI patients preferred complex and professional activities such as table tennis and badminton. They believe that these activities can help the brain perform better in terms of reaction time and cognitive functions. As a result, it is necessary to tailor individualized exercise intervention programs to the unique characteristics and preferences of each patient.\nOur study classified MCI patients\u2019 memory compensation strategies as self-helping, partially dependent, or entirely dependent on people or objects due to memory loss. In our study, patients with mild cognitive impairment most frequently used self-helping and partial dependency compensation strategies to increase their independence and daily functional capacity (Tomaszewski Farias et\u00a0al., 2018). In the Memory Compensation Questionnaire (MCQ), Dixon (Dixon et\u00a0al., 2001; de Frias and Dixon, 2005) described five memory compensation strategies: internal aids (such as psychological imagination), spending more energy (such as focusing more on learning new names), spending more time completing tasks (such as slowing down reading), external aids (such as shopping lists), and recruiting others for\nhelp. This is consistent with our study\u2019s classification, as the first three of the five categories above are consistent with a self-helping memory compensation strategy. A completely dependent memory compensation strategy refers to patients who entirely rely on others to remind and help them cope with the memory impairment. In our study, the majority of patients with MCI resisted using this strategy, which appears to be\u00a0related to a fear of ridicule from others and the stigma associated with memory loss. However, older MCI patients (2 patients around 80 years old in our study) may be\u00a0more inclined to employ an entirely dependent memory compensation strategy, with spousal reminders as the primary method. They were candid in describing how their spouse assisted them and reminded them of the important things in their lives, and how much they appreciated the spousal reminders.\nAdditionally, we\u00a0discovered that patients with MCI would engage in any type of memory compensation strategy voluntarily. Numerous researchers (Frankenmolen et\u00a0al., 2018; Tomaszewski Farias et\u00a0 al., 2018) have demonstrated that memory compensation training improves patients\u2019 memory function and ability to function in daily life and that it can be\u00a0 used passively by researchers or healthcare workers to improve patients\u2019 health outcomes. It necessitates further research into how to guide patients in properly training memory compensation strategies in order to assist them in coping with memory impairment and improving functions and health outcomes. Furthermore, we\u00a0believe that memory compensation strategies should be\u00a0 approached dialectically. To prevent patients from becoming overly reliant on memory compensation strategies, caregivers should limit their use. This could result in delays in obtaining medical assistance and implementing other effective interventions.\nPatients with MCI frequently struggle with emotional problems such as anxiety, depression, apathy, fear, and worry. In patients, negative emotions are linked to cognitive decline and poor physical health. Additionally, it may increase the likelihood of conversion to AD (Lu et\u00a0al., 2009; Yates et\u00a0al., 2017; Liew, 2020). As a result, addressing and resolving the emotional problems of MCI patients has become a critical and meaningful component of emotional management. In our study, MCI patients demonstrated a high level of willingness to deal with emotions and actively identify and manage emotional problems. Additionally, Smith et\u00a0 al. highlighted MCI patients\u2019 expectations for improved emotional indicators (Smith et\u00a0al., 2018). However, our research indicated that patients lacked knowledge of appropriate and effective emotional processing techniques, preferring to tolerate and vent emotional distress. We\u00a0were unable to locate any previous studies examining emotion management preferences in MCI patients, but we\u00a0did discover interventions that could help MCI patients with bad moods. Numerous people use methods based on various meditation practices to enhance their cognitive abilities and mood (Horrigan, 2007; Marciniak et\u00a0 al., 2020). A mindfulness-based stress reduction program (MBSR) had a positive effect on alleviating the depression of MCI patients and was widely accepted by participants (Marciniak et\u00a0 al., 2020).\nFrontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org\nAdditionally, studies have shown that increasing self-efficacy can help people with MCI feel better and have a higher quality of life (Tonga et\u00a0al., 2020)."

            "text": "There are some limitations to our study. First, the participants in this study were a small number of MCI patients from a specific region in China, and might not represent other regions\u2019 patients with MCI, resulting in selection bias. However, thematic saturation was reached in our study, and characteristic information about MCI patients\u2019 self-management preferences was fully obtained. Secondly, the interview data in our study are transcribed using Chinese and translated into English. The translation is done by one researcher, reviewed by another doctoral researcher, and any language issues were discussed and resolved by the research group. Although we\u00a0have tried to avoid linguistic ambiguity, there might be\u00a0expressions in native languages. In addition, patients in the study were recently diagnosed with MCI, and we\u00a0 did not consider longitudinal changes in self-management preferences. At the same time, we\u00a0did not consider the impact of decreased executive function on daily living functions in MCI patients, so an assessment of this issue was lacking. We\u00a0suggest that longitudinal studies of MCI patients\u2019 preferences for self-management should be\u00a0carried out to learn more about possible changes. Finally, given the inevitable limitations of the qualitative research perspective, we\u00a0 suggest that the quantitative study should be\u00a0conducted for self-management preferences in MCI patients in the future."

It\u2019s important to explore self-management preferences in patients with MCI because it prevents healthcare professionals from recommending or using undesired attribute guidance or requiring MCI patients to self-manage and can save scarce medical resources and protect patients from low-value interventions, increasing selfmanagement compliance and improving patient-related health outcomes in turn (Hummel et\u00a0 al., 2012). In addition, the implementation of self-management is a multi-team effort in which healthcare professionals play an essential role in selfmanagement support for MCI patients. Healthcare professionals should respect the self-management preferences of MCI patients and provide personalized guidance, treatment, care, and support based on patients\u2019 preferences. More importantly, healthcare professionals should fully consider and respect MCI patients\u2019 preferences within the scope of scientific and effective medical treatment. Excessive reliance on or compliance with patients\u2019 preferences may influence the intervention effect. Healthcare\nprofessionals should balance patients\u2019 preferences with scientific interventions to manage MCI more effectively."
