    "abstractText": "Objective: Depressive disorders are common in long-term care (LTC), however, there is no one process used to detect depressive disorders in this setting. Our goal was to describe the diagnostic accuracy of depression detection tools used in LTC settings. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy measures. The databases PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL were searched from inception to 10 September 2021. Studies involving persons living in LTC, assisted living residences or facilities, comparing diagnostic accuracy of depression tools with a reference standard, were included. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess risk of bias. Results: We identified 8,463 citations, of which 20 studies were included in qualitative synthesis and 19 in meta-analysis. We identified 23 depression detection tools (including different versions) that were validated against a reference standard. At a cut-off point of 6 on the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15), the pooled sensitivity was 73.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 43.9%\u201376.5%), specificity was 76.5% (95% CI 62.9%\u201386.7%), and an area under the curve was 0.83. There was significant heterogeneity in these analyses. There was insufficient data to conduct meta-analysis of other screening tools. The Nursing Homes Short Depression Inventory (NH-SDI) had a sensitivity ranging from 40.0% to 98.0%. The 4-item Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) had the highest sensitivity (67.0%\u201390.0%) for persons in LTC living with dementia. Conclusions: There are 23 tools validated for detection of depressive disorders in LTC, with the GDS-15 being the most studied. Tools developed specifically for use in LTC settings include the NH-SDI and CSDD-4, which provide briefer options to screen for depression. However, more studies of both are needed to examine tool accuracy using meta-analyses.",

Our goal was to describe the diagnostic accuracy of depression detection tools used in LTC settings. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy measures. The databases PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL were searched from inception to 10 September 2021. Studies involving persons living in LTC, assisted living residences or facilities, comparing diagnostic accuracy of depression tools with a reference standard, were included. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess risk of bias. Results: We identified 8,463 citations, of which 20 studies were included in qualitative synthesis and 19 in meta-analysis. We identified 23 depression detection tools (including different versions) that were validated against a reference standard. At a cut-off point of 6 on the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15), the pooled sensitivity was 73.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 43.9%\u201376.5%), specificity was 76.5% (95% CI 62.9%\u201386.7%), and an area under the curve was 0.83. There was significant heterogeneity in these analyses. There was insufficient data to conduct meta-analysis of other screening tools. The Nursing Homes Short Depression Inventory (NH-SDI) had a sensitivity ranging from 40.0% to 98.0%. The 4-item Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) had the highest sensitivity (67.0%\u201390.0%) for persons in LTC living with dementia. Conclusions: There are 23 tools validated for detection of depressive disorders in LTC, with the GDS-15 being the most studied. Tools developed specifically for use in LTC settings include the NH-SDI and CSDD-4, which provide briefer options to screen for depression. However, more studies of both are needed to examine tool accuracy using meta-analyses.\nKeywords: older people, diagnostic accuracy, systematic review, depressive symptoms, depression, long-term care\nic.oup.com /ageing/article/51/3/afac039/6540127 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024\nKey Points\n\u2022 Providers need an evidence-based approach to case finding depressive symptoms in persons living in long-term care. \u2022 There are many validated tools for detecting depressive symptoms in persons living in long-term care, however not all are\nequally accurate. \u2022 The NH-SDI and CSDD-4 appear to have reasonable accuracy for detecting depressive symptoms, while also being brief\nassessment tools\u2014however there are few studies examining their use. \u2022 More studies are needed to understand the accuracy of these tools.\nIntroduction\nThirty-five to 44% of persons living in long-term care (LTC) in high-income countries, are diagnosed with depression or are living with symptoms of depression [1\u20133]. LTC was defined as any facility where the persons reside and requires on site 24-hour nursing and personal care [19]. Although context in LTC facilitates internationally differs, we included articles focused on settings with 24-hour nursing care as the core defining feature [20]. Depressive disorders, herein referred to as depression, are common with a meta-analysis in LTC reporting a depression prevalence 29% [4]. LTC facility lock-downs due to the COVID-19 pandemic have increased social isolation and loneliness, which may further contribute to depression in LTC residents [5]. Depression can have detrimental effects on cognition, physical health and quality of life [6, 7]. Despite the high prevalence and associated adverse outcomes of depression in LTC residents, it frequently goes under-diagnosed and undertreated [6, 7].\nWhen depression is considered in diagnostic accuracy studies categories included are often no depression, clinically relevant depressive symptoms and all depressive disorders (e.g. anything diagnosed by a reference standard like major depression or dysthymia). Depression detection tools are aimed at detecting depressive symptoms or disorders that warrant further assessment with a clinician interview based on a reference standard or criteria. Thus, when examining the accuracy of tools we want to understand how they compare to criteria for any of the depressive disorders. As clinically we want a depression tool used in LTC to detect any of the depressive disorders because they all impact the wellness and outcomes for residents.\nThere are several potential barriers to explain why depression goes under-diagnosed in LTC residents, including lack of staff training, lack of resources and comorbidities such as symptoms of poor concentration and diminished attention that also present in persons with dementia [1\u2013 3, 6\u20138]. Detection protocols and increased education may improve detection of depression in settings where time and human resources available for assessment may be barriers [9]. Increased knowledge of which screening tools provide the best validity in recognizing depression in persons living in LTC will help to inform protocols aimed at detection.\nGiven how common and burdensome depression is, there is an urgent need for accurate depression detection tools appropriate for the LTC context. Misidentifying residents as\ndepressed or not identifying residents suffering from depressive symptoms, can lead to inappropriate management [1\u2013 3, 8]. Increased accurate detection of depressive symptoms in LTC can increase the frequency of treatment and referral by primary care physicians, which may in turn improve outcomes of persons living in LTC with depression [10]. Prior systematic reviews pertaining to depression in LTC focus on prevention, risk factors and treatments but not diagnostic accuracy [11\u201315].\nIt is important to understand the validity of depression screening tools applied in LTC settings to improve detection, which may lead to improved management of depression in persons living in LTC. The objective of our systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of screening tools for detecting depression in persons living in LTC.\nMethods\nThe study protocol with analyses plans was created and registered a priori with PROSPERO (CRD42018106329). We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) statement to aid protocol development [16]. We reported our findings as per the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (PRISMA-DTA) statement [17] (Appendix 1).\nSearch strategies and literature sources\nThe databases PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL were searched from inception to 10 July 2018. An updated search was conducted to 10 September 2021. The main search clusters were \u2018Long Term Care\u2217\u2019, \u2018Home for the Aged\u2019, \u2018Elderly Care\u2217\u2019 combined with the terms, \u2018Depress\u2019, \u2018Dysthymic Disorder\u2019, and \u2018Case Finding tool\u2217\u2019 or \u2018Diagnos\u2217 Accuracy\u2019 (Appendix 2). To develop the search term cluster for LTC, we reviewed prior systematic reviews focused on any aspect of LTC, including terms such as LTC, nursing homes and homes for the aged (Appendix 2). This was done to be inclusive. Text and explosion of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) were applied and articles were restricted to the English language. Reference lists of Cochrane systematic reviews were manually searched, to ensure a comprehensive search of the literature. The final search strategy was developed by an experienced researcher,\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ageing/article/51/3/afac039/6540127 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024\nand reviewed and refined by an experienced librarian. We did not complete a forward citation search. The grey literature was searched using the CADTH Grey Matters tool [18].\nStudy screening and selection\nAll citations, abstracts and full texts were independently reviewed by two reviewers (Z.G., F.A., B.M. and G.L.). Disagreement was resolved through inclusion of the full-text article or discussion with a third reviewer. At the title and abstract screening stage, papers that included persons living in LTC, assisted living residence or facilities, and screened for depressive symptoms were included. At the abstract phase, we included any article that referred to any tool that measured depressive symptoms or disorders to be inclusive. At the full-text stage, studies involving persons living in LTC, assisted living residences or facilities, comparing diagnostic accuracy of depression tools with a reference standard, were included. Any tool measuring depressive symptoms or disorders was included. The reference standard was defined as either all versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for any depressive disorder, the Provisional Diagnostic Criteria for Depression in Dementia, the International Classification of Diseases or a clinical diagnosis of depression [21\u2013 23]. We did not restrict reference standards to only major depression, but any clinically relevant depressive disorder. This was done to ensure the findings were clinically relevant to providers in LTC who need a tool that can detect any depressive disorder of concern.\nRisk of bias assessment and methodologic quality assessment\nWe used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool to assess the risk of bias and methodologic quality of included studies [24]. There are four domains and 24-items on the QUADAS-2 tool focused on the assessment of patient selection, use of index tool, use of reference standard, and flow and timing of administration of tools [24]. Two study authors (B.M. and P.W.) completed the tool independently for all included studies. Disagreement was resolved through discussion (with Z.G.).\nData synthesis, extraction and analysis\nThe main outcomes of interest were diagnostic accuracy measures associated with depression screening tools in LTC, assisted living residence or assisted living facility populations. Diagnostic accuracy measures included sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs), positive and negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) and area under the curve (AUC). Mean age was calculated by averaging weighted mean ages by sample size reported across included studies.\nStudy authors (B.M and Z.G.) developed the data dictionary a priori, with predefined data items including participant demographics, study size, prevalence of depression, mean age, sensitivity, specificity, LRs and predictive values.\nOne study author (B.M.) extracted data, and another study author independently verified data extraction (P.W.).\nPooled prevalence\nPooled point prevalence of depression, as determined by the reference standard diagnosis of depression, was calculated using Mantel\u2013Haenszel-weighted DerSimonian and Laird models [25]. The I2 statistic and Cochran Q statistic were used to assess heterogeneity, with a P value of 0.05 considered statistically significant [26]. Low heterogeneity was defined at 0%\u201340%, moderate heterogeneity was defined at 30%\u201360%, and substantial heterogeneity was defined at 50%\u201390% [26]. We performed these analyses using Stata, release 14.\nMeta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy: sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios\nWe derived summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves, optimal cut-point thresholds and AUC values at optimal cut-point thresholds for the GDS-15. We pooled true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), false negative (FN) values at reported cutoffs for the GDS-15 using an inverse variance weighted linear mixed effects model that incorporated different random slopes [27]. We presented SROC curves with confidence regions. We used visual inspection of SROC curves to examine heterogeneity. We also presented positive (LR+) and negative (LR\u2212) likelihood ratios. We performed these analyses in R, version 4.0.0.\nResults\nThe database yielded 12,163 records. After removing duplicates, we screened 8,463 titles and abstracts. Seven hundred full-text articles were assessed, of which 20 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis [2, 3, 28\u201345] and 19 in the qualitative synthesis [2, 3, 28\u201335, 37\u201345]. Four of the studies drew from the same study populations, the largest of the studies was included when calculating the prevalence depression and dementia [33\u201336]. No additional articles were included from the updated search (Figure 1). Exclusion reasons are listed in Figure 1. The main reason for exclusion was no use of a reference standard to diagnose depression (n = 267). Nineteen studies provided diagnostic accuracy measures for 23 depression screening tools, which were applied in LTC settings (Table 1).\nRisk of bias assessment\nSix studies had unclear blinding. Unclear reporting of when the index test was administered was the primary concern to the validity of findings across 14 studies [2, 31, 32, 34\u2013 43] (Appendix 3). It was unclear whether all eligible persons were included, which may have introduced bias in five of the included studies [3, 31\u201333, 38]. Eight studies did not\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ageing/article/51/3/afac039/6540127 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024\nAll included studies were written in English and published between 1986 and 2016 [28\u201340, 44]. The mean age across included studies ranged from 75.9 years to 85.9 years, with a mean age of 82.5 years. Studies were conducted in Australia, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and the USA. Across the 19 unique study populations, 3,454 persons living in LTC facilitates were included. The prevalence of depression within the included sample ranged from a minimum of 9.4% to maximum 81.4%. Eight studies reported the prevalence of dementia, which ranged from a minimum of 38.0% to a maximum of 84.5% [3, 28,\n29, 32, 33, 36\u201338]. Three studies also measured anxiety prevalence, the minimum prevalence of anxiety was 1.6% and the maximum prevalence was 36.6% [31, 32, 38]. Other comorbidities, such as mild cognitive impairment, were not reported consistently enough to report prevalence.\nPooled prevalence of depression and dementia\nThe pooled prevalence of depression diagnosis, as determined by the reference standard, from 19 unique study populations was 30.3% (95% CI = 23.0%\u201337.5%). Substantial heterogeneity was associated with the depression prevalence estimate (I2 = 96.4% heterogeneity P =<0.001). The pooled prevalence of dementia diagnosis, as determined by either the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, Mini-Mental State Exam, Global Deterioration Scale, and Diagnostic and\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ageing/article/51/3/afac039/6540127 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024\nTable 1.

Significant heterogeneity was associated with the dementia prevalence estimate (I2 = 90.7% heterogeneity P =<0.001).\nDiagnostic accuracy of depression screening tools\nDiagnostic accuracy measures were provided for 23 depression screening tools, described in detail in Table 2. In brief, these include but are not limited to Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia-4 Item Version (CSDD-4), Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia Modified for use by Long Term Care Staff (CSDD-M-LTCS), Depression Rating Scale (DRS), Geriatric Depression Scale-30 (GDS-30), Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15), Geriatric Depression Scale Residential-12 (GDS-12R), Geriatric Depression Scale8 (GDS-8), Nursing homes short depression inventory (NH-SDI) and Nijmegen Observer-Rated Depression (NORD).\nThe diagnostic accuracy measures of all 23 tools are included in Table 1. For all persons living in LTC, the NHSDI with a cutoff of >6 provided the best balance between sensitivity and specificity, 0.87 and 0.85, respectively [39].\nFor persons living in LTC with dementia, the CSDD-4 with a cutoff of >2 provided the best cut-off balance between sensitivity (0.90) and specificity (0.97) [34]. For persons living in LTC without dementia, the CSDD-19 with a cutoff of >7 provided the best cut-off balance (sensitivity 0.90; specificity 0.81) [34].\nWe included eight studies in our meta-analysis to derive the optimal GDS-15 cut-off value suggestive of a diagnosis of major depressive disorder [28, 30, 37, 40\u201343, 45]. At the optimal cut-off value of 6, the pooled sensitivity was 73.6% (95% CI 43.9%\u201376.5%), the pooled specificity was 76.5% (95% CI 62.9%\u201386.7%) and the AUC was 0.83 (Table 3 and Figure 2). There was significant heterogeneity in these estimates. There was insufficient data to conduct sensitivity analyses, or a meta-analysis of other screening tools.\nDiscussion\nWe identified 23 depression screening tools that detect depression in persons living in LTC (Table 2) compared to a reference standard for any depressive disorder.

It is important to distinguish between persons with and without dementia when screening for depression, as the presence of anosognosia or lack of awareness, which is common in persons with dementia may limit application of selfrated screening tools to detect depression [46]. The use of caregiver- or clinician-rated tools for persons with dementia may be beneficial if anosognosia is present to ensure the most accurate reporting of depression symptoms.\nThe pooled prevalence of depression diagnosis was 30.2% (95% CI = 22.4%\u201338.0%). A recent systematic review describing the pooled prevalence of depression symptoms in persons living in LTC was 27.1%, which is comparable to our prevalence estimate [47]. It is important, however, to note there was high heterogeneity associated with our prevalence estimate, which may be in part due to inconsistent reporting of depression in persons with and without dementia. Only three studies reported different depression prevalence estimates in persons with and without dementia [31, 35, 36].\nThe pooled prevalence of dementia diagnosis across seven unique study populations was 57.6% (95% CI = 47.9%\u2013 67.3%). Our prevalence estimate of dementia closely aligns with a systematic review from 2010, that reported the median prevalence of dementia in LTC as 58%, pooled from 30 studies [4].\nPooled cutoffs for the GDS-15 applied to all persons living it LTC and were not specific to persons with or without dementia. The optimal cutoff of 6, provided well-balanced sensitivity and specificity values (sensitivity 73.6% (95% CI 43.9%\u201376.5%); specificity 76.5% (95% CI 62.9%\u201386.7%). Sensitivity and specificity were weighted 50% each in our calculations. There was significant heterogeneity in this estimate, likely related to variations in study location, inclusion of persons with and without cognitive impairment, and some differences between reference standards. We did not have enough data to do further analyses of this. The comparison of the GDS 15 to a reference standard for any depressive disorder (e.g. major depression + minor depression, etc.) was done as this is what is most commonly reported in these studies, and what represents the most likely clinical scenario where clinicians would want to detect any depressive disorder not only major depression. Compared to the GDS-30, the GDS-15 provides a briefer screening tool that may be best for use in LTC settings where there is limited time and resources to screen for depression. However, the NH-SDI and CSDD may represent more accurate tools for use in LTC, given their apparent higher sensitivities. However, additional studies are required to further validate these tools.\nThe NH-SDI had higher sensitivity and specificity values for all persons living in LTC when compared to the GDS-15. The NH-SDI was developed specifically for use within LTC populations, is administered by nursing staff, and is meant to be easily integrated into nursing procedures [39].\nThe CSDD-4 had the highest sensitivity and specificity values for persons living in LTC with dementia, and is a shortened version of the original 19-item version [34]. Although the CSDD was developed for use in persons with dementia, it has also been validated for use in persons without dementia [48, 49]. The use of the CSDD-19 has been recommended when screening for depression in persons with dementia, given it includes both assessments in consultation with caregivers and directly with persons living with dementia [50]. However, we found that the CSDD4 had the best diagnostic accuracy measures for screening depression in persons with dementia and is briefer then the 19-item CSDD.\nIt is important to consider the informant source of depression screening tools (Table 2). While caregiver administered tools may be used in persons with dementia who do not have the self-awareness required to self-report depression symptoms, caregiver burden may cause caregiver rating bias [51]. Consideration must therefore be given to the level of caregiver burden, when choosing to employ a caregiverrated screening tool for depression. The use of clinician- and nurse-administered tools must consider the ease with which the tools can be added to clinical practice and how well they know the person being administered the tool. A key barrier to screening for depression in older adults is time constraints, therefore screening tools must be both brief and provide good diagnostic accuracy measures [9]. Six depression screening tools included within our systematic review were developed specifically for integration into LTC practice,\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /ageing/article/51/3/afac039/6540127 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024\nincluding the CSDD-M-LTC, DRS, GDS-8, GDS-12-R, NH-SDI and NORD [36, 39, 40, 52\u201354]. Both the NHSDI and DRS contain 16-items, the GDS-12R contains 12 items, the GDS-8 contains 8 items, and the NORD has 5-items. Although the DRS is most commonly applied in LTC facilities in North America, given its inclusion in the inter-RAI (Resident Assessment Instrument), only one study assessed it against a reference standard [40]. Overall, depression screening tools adapted for use in LTC may provide a briefer assessment of depression, which may help address time resource limitations.\nTo mitigate the risk of possibly missing literature, we conducted our search in collaboration with an experienced research librarian, and searched grey literature and references of included studies. Included studies did not provide an assessment of all cutoffs for depression screening tools and we were unable to conduct more comprehensive analyses. Due to resource constraints we could only include English language studies. We were unable to conduct a sensitivity analysis given inconsistent reporting of comorbidities such as anxiety, dementia and pain which may confound depression measurements. There was limited data on sex, gender, race and ethnicity which limits generalizability; furthermore, studies were primarily conducted in Europe and North America limiting generalizability within Asia and Africa. The studies included within this review represent older adults, with an average age of study participants of 82.7 years. This may bias the findings towards older adults, and future research should focus on the assessment of the diagnostic accuracy of depression screening tools in younger persons living in LTC. Future research should also focus on more consistent reporting of depression in the various populations residing in long-term care, including those with and without dementia.\nConclusion\nDetecting depression in LTC is important to improving both quality of care and quality of life. Although 23 depression screening tools were identified, the NH-SDI provided a higher sensitivity and specificity for all persons living in LTC, compared to all included screening tools. The CSDD4 provided higher sensitivity and specificity for persons with dementia living in LTC, compared to all included screening tools developed for use in LTC. The GDS-15 was the only tool with enough data to meta-analyse and had a lower pooled sensitivity and specificity than the NHSDI and CSDD-4. Our results highlight the importance of employing an accurate depression screening tool that best suits the different populations living in long-term care, with consideration given to cognitive function. Healthcare workers should make themselves aware of available depression screening tools for use in LTC and employ the one that best suits their population of interest.\nSupplementary Data: Supplementary data are available at AGEING online.\nDeclaration of Conflicts of Interest: None.\nDeclaration of Sources of Funding: None.\nReferences\n1.
