1. **Investigate the long-term effectiveness of the Monday-enhanced CEASE program.** The current study only followed participants for 3 months after the program ended. A longer-term follow-up study could assess whether the program's effects are sustained over time.


2. **Compare the effectiveness of the Monday-enhanced CEASE program to other smoking cessation interventions.** This could help to determine whether the Monday-enhanced CEASE program is more effective than other commonly used interventions, such as nicotine replacement therapy or behavioral counseling.


3. **Explore the mechanisms of action of the Monday-enhanced CEASE program.** This could help to identify the specific components of the program that are responsible for its effectiveness. For example, researchers could investigate the role of social support, motivation, and temporal landmarks in the program's success.


4. **Adapt the Monday-enhanced CEASE program for other populations.** The current study was conducted with a low-income ethnic minority population in Baltimore City. Future studies could adapt the program for other populations, such as rural residents, adolescents, or pregnant women.


5. **Develop and evaluate a digital version of the Monday-enhanced CEASE program.** This could make the program more accessible to people who live in remote areas or who have difficulty attending in-person sessions. A digital version of the program could also be used to reach people who are interested in quitting smoking but who are not ready to commit to a traditional smoking cessation program.
