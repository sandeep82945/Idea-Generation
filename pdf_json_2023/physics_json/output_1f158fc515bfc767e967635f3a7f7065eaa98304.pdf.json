    "abstractText": "Copper and its alloys are used widely in marine environments, and anisotropic corrosion influences the corrosion kinetics of copper. Corrosion of copper in an electrolyte containing Cl\u2212 is described as a dissolution\u2013deposition process, which is a prolonged process. Therefore, it is laborious to clarify the corrosion anisotropy in different stages. In this paper, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) following elapsed open circuit potential (OCP) test with 0 h (0H), 24 h (24H) and 10 days (10D) was adopted. To exclude interruptions such as grain boundary and neighbor effect, single crystal (SC) Cu(100) and Cu(111) were employed. After 10D OCP, cross-sectional slices were cut and picked up by a focused ion beam (FIB). The results showed that the deposited oxide was Cu2O and Cu(100)/Cu(111) experienced different corrosion behaviors. In general, Cu(100) showed more excellent corrosion resistance. Combined with equivalent electrical circuit (EEC) diagrams, the corrosion mechanism of Cu(100)/Cu(111) in different stages was proposed. In the initial stage, a smaller capacitive loop of Cu(111) suggested preferential adsorption of Cl\u2212 on air-formed oxide film on Cu(111). Deposited oxide and exposed bare metals also played an important role in corrosion resistance. Rectangle indentations and pyramidal structures formed on Cu(100)/Cu(111), respectively. Finally, a perfect interface on Cu(100) explained the tremendous capacitive loop and higher impedance (14,274 \u03a9\u00b7cm2). Moreover, defects in the oxides on Cu(111) provided channels for the penetration of electrolyte, leading to a lower impedance (9423 \u03a9\u00b7cm2) after 10D corrosion.",

            "text": "Corrosion of copper and its alloys containing Cl\u2212 environment has attracted great attention due to the excellent corrosion resistance to seawater and wide usage in marine environments, such as in the manufacturing of pipes, pumps, valves and ship propellers [1]. The corrosion behavior of copper in the Cl\u2212 environment is described as a dissolution and deposition process [2\u20134]. Zhao [5] used a dissolution\u2013ionization\u2013diffusion\u2013deposition (DIDD) process to define the complex corrosion of 20 steel and 3Cr steel. In this mode, various types of metal atoms showed different dissolution rates in the M/S interface when a metal atom dissolved and formed a cation. Subsequently, different concentrations of cation led to various levels of hydrolysis. Consequently, the supersaturation degree and critical surface energy of nucleation for corrosion product would be changed. During the prolonged corrosion process, the anisotropic corrosion behavior of copper was found in the dissolution and deposition stages since atomic density changes in different orientations [6]. Moreover, extensive literature indicated that corrosion behavior strongly depends on the local surface reactivity, and the surface reactivity itself can be strongly influenced by the crystallographic orientation [7\u20139]. X.Y. reported that the orientation-dependent corrosion rate of 90Cu-10Ni\nMaterials 2023, 16, 1740. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16041740 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 1740 2 of 15\nin acidic NaCl solution followed the order of (001) < (101) < (111) [10]. Ma [11] proposed a surface step dissolution model to explain the faster dissolution of the closest packed (111) planes, where coordination number played an important role in understanding the abnormal corrosion rate. Evenly in pure water, fine copper wires showed anisotropic dissolution where the dissolution rate increases in the order of (111) < (001) < (110) [12]. During the deposition, Cu2O is one of the possible products after the corrosion of copper in NaCl solutions, according to the Pourbaix diagram. Cu2O shows the capacity of a P-type semiconductor [13,14], which means some protection from penetration. Furthermore, the protective ability of oxides is associated with the compactness of the crystal. It was reported that granular oxides on Cu(100) contributed to the faster dissolution of oxides [15\u201317]. Therefore, less compact oxide is unhelpful, although passivation can be predicted by the Pourbaix diagram. Through the above analysis, anisotropic corrosion varied in different stages. Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful tool in the investigation of corrosion behavior that not only provides a non-destructive assessment of the corrosion rate but also enables the determination of the corrosion mechanism [18,19]. EIS can separate the diffusion processes from other physico-chemical processes in a wide frequency spectrum, which has served as a powerful and routine tool in estimating the diffusion coefficient [20,21]. Previously, samples were cleaned and migrated from a corrosive environment to an electrochemical workstation after corrosion [22,23]. In this way, the corrosion frontier, namely the solution/metal (S/M) interface, was changed, and the new balance was reconstructed at the interface instead of the S/M interface in the original corrosive conditions. In this paper, immediate EIS following elapsed open circuit potential (OCP) test was adopted. Microstructures, such as grain boundaries [24,25], twins [26,27] and grain size [28,29], can also influence corrosion behavior profoundly. At present, it has been reported that neighbor grain also laid an effect on corrosion [30]. Single crystal (SC) [31\u201333] has some advantages in excluding various influences of microstructures. For example, P.B. [34] successfully confirmed the anisotropic dissolution of Fe3Al SCs in sulphuric acid. Therefore, (100) planes of Fe3Al with the highest atomic density showed a modest corrosion rate. L.N. [33] also reported that a well-compact passive film with field-controlled formed on (013)/(014) planes and a porous film with diffusion control formed on (146) planes. Therefore, SC Cu(100)/(111) were adopted in this paper. As a result, the purpose of this study is to elucidate the corrosion anisotropy of copper in different stages by EIS of SC Cu(100)/Cu(111). SCs were immersed in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solutions under OCP monitoring for 0 h (0H), 24 h (24H) and 10 days (10D), followed by EIS immediately. SCs exhibited various behaviors in different corrosion stages, and differences were also found between Cu(100) and Cu(111) for the same corrosion time. Bare metals and oxides on SCs were both taken into consideration to explain the variations in corrosion behaviors. Distinct interface for Cu(100)/Cu(111) was an important factor contributing to the protective ability of deposited oxides. Combined with an equivalent electrical circuit (EEC), the corrosion mechanism of SCs in different stages was discussed finally."

A standard three-electrode system with a platinum grid as the counter electrode, a KCl-saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode and Cu SCs as the working electrodes was applied on CS310 electrochemical workstation by CorrTest Corporation at Wuhan of China. Electrochemical impedance sp ctroscopy (EIS) tests were c nducted by setting a set alternating current (AC) signal of 10 mV to a frequency range of 105 Hz to 10\u22122 Hz. The results f EIS were analyzed and simulated by ZVi w 2 embedded in CS stud o 5 softwar . A potentiodynamic scan was conducted fr m \u22120.8 V to 0.8 V (vs. SCE) at a rate of 1 mV/s, and the partial r nge was shown in this paper. The morphologie of corrosion products (CPs) after immersi n in elect lytes were imaged on scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7610F Plus, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) and assembled with a backscatter (BSE) detector. Phase constitution was detected by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, UK) detector, XRD, as well as electron probe microanalysis (EPMA, JXA-8530F PLUS, JEOL, Japan). Three-dimensional (3D) topography of corroded samples was obtained by laser-scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM, OLS4000, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). To acquire the cross-sectional information of corroded samples, slices at different zones were milled and picked up by a focused ion\nMaterials 2023, 16, 1740 4 of 15\nbeam (FIB, Helios G4 UX, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA), of which the thickness was approximately 4 \u00b5m enough for SEM and EDS characterization."

            "text": "The morphologies of corroded samples were displayed in Figure 2 after different durations of OCP tests. Many rectangular indentations in different sizes were observed in Figure 2a after 24H OCP. The side walls of the indentations were vertical to the sample surface, which was like the embedded diagram at the lower-right corner. Other profiles can be viewed as a combination of adjacent smaller rectangles. The enlarged picture in Figure 2a showed that the bottom was not a flat plane but with extensive steps, and the corners of steps approximately equaled 90\u25e6. Morphology changed drastically after 10D corrosion of Cu(100) SC, as shown in Figure 2b. Two types of features accounted for the corroded surface, namely rough flocculent-like region and slightly flat planes with extensive pits, which means corrosion products are completely covered on the substrate. For Cu(111) SC after 24H OCP shown in Figure 2c, many inverted pyramids were detected, and the substrate was exposed at the bottoms of pyramids. Many shaded triangles were also exhibited under BSE observation, which should be treated as component segregation, and further EPMA results would confirm this. After 10D OCP, the corroded surface of Cu(111) showed a slushy appearance with some small flakes on it, and the pyramidal structures totally disappeared. From the vague tripe (surrounded by red dotted lines) and enlarged morphology in Figure 2d, the flakes on Cu(111) might be the remained surface, which was like the flat areas in Figure 2b. It was deduced that more extensive dissolution occurred on Cu(111), and the pyramidal structures were covered totally by corrosion products. X.Y. [10] deduced that (001), (111), (101) and (112) planes were all possible faceted planes depending on the deviated angle against low-indexed planes. Herein, the vertical side walls in Cu(100) SC and inverted pyramids, which can be viewed as one corner cut by (111) planes showed in Figure 2c, suggested that the faceted planes are (100) planes. Materials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 17\nThe constitution of different positions after 24H OCP was detected by EPMA, and\nMaterials 2023, 16, 1740 5 of 15\nThe constitution of different positions after 24H OCP was detected by EPMA, and results were generated in Table 1. Position 1 was at the bottom of the corroded pit, and almost complete Cu accounted for the constitution with a slight O element. It was suggested that these rectangular pits remained by a dissolution process, and the bare Cu was exposed at the bottoms of the pits. Furthermore, the atomic ratio of Cu/O exceeded that of Cu2O, which is a reasonable corrosion product of Cu in 3.5% wt.% NaCl solutions. It might be the result that the thickness of the oxide was too small, and the electron beam detected the substrate across the surficial oxide; it was different for Cu(111) SC. The composition of the side wall at position 3 was almost Cu, while the constitution at position 4 approached Cu2O, which means that the depth of oxides in the triangles was larger than that of oxides in Cu(100) SC. Composition at position 5 was similar to position 2 but with a slightly higher atomic ratio of Cu/O, which can be explained by the fact that thicker oxides formed on Cu(111) SC after the same corrosion time. The component of corrosion products was further characterized by XRD after 10D OCP. Compared with the single peak for as-received SC, the square frames A and B in Figure 1c were enlarged views of Cu(100)-10D from 40\u25e6 to 45\u25e6 and Cu(111)-10D from 35\u25e6 to 40\u25e6, where slight Cu2O(200) and Cu2O(111) peaks were detected. The subsequent peaks confirmed the reliability of the above analysis that the constitution of oxide was Cu2O. It was noted that Cl\u2212 level remained stable, approaching 0, which should be viewed as background noise and can be neglected.\nTo compare the thickness of oxides on different surfaces, cross-sectional slices were cut and picked up by FIB, which included the substrate, oxides and deposited Pt layer. Figures 3a and 4a showed the sectional appearances from flat and flocculent-like regions on Cu(100) SC, respectively. From the analysis above, the surface was smooth with several indentations, and the indentations did not stretch to the substrate in Figure 3a. The interface between oxides and Cu was composed of several segments. Interestingly, some of the segments showed a degree against the horizon instead of being vertical, as the red dotted lines show. The interface was almost perfect with rare leaks, and the thickness of the oxides layer ranged from 0.7 \u00b5m to 0.9 \u00b5m. However, Figure 4a shows an uneven surface and more defects at the interface. The enlarged picture in the middle upper part suggested the leak was blocked and did not exist at a long distance. Moreover, the connecting parts at the interface were compact, and the thickness of oxides varied at a larger range from 0.5 \u00b5m to 1.5 \u00b5m. In Figure 3b, a less compact interface was observed for Cu(111) SC situation, where long-distance leaks existed at the interface and crevice stretched along the whole interface. It departed the substrate from oxides obviously. Furthermore, leaks also existed inside the oxides, as the enlarged pattern shows, which means terrible cohesion between oxides and substrate. It may contribute to the easy penetration of electrolytes into the substrate. The constitution of oxide was also characterized by an EDS map, line and point scan, as shown in Figure 4. Element map showed good consistency with SEM profiles, where O highlighted the intermediate layer and Cu changed inapparently. Cl\u2212 served as background noise, which was further verified during a line scan with an extremely low signal. The signal of O remained steady at a compact range of oxides, and the climbing curve of Cu may be caused by the interruption of deposited Pt. Finally, the mass ratio of Cu/O was 9/1, which was slightly higher than Cu2O. It can be explained as the deviation of EDS or incomplete oxidation during corrosion. According to the Pourbaix diagram [2,4,35,36] and\nMaterials 2023, 16, 1740 6 of 15\nextensive research [3,37], CuCl\u22122 is believed to be the main cuprous complex in seawater and NaCl electrolytes, with approximately 0.55 mol/L concentrations of Cl\u2212. CuCl\u22122 was deposited on the substrate according to Formula (1) in the condition where supersaturation was achieved. By combining the constitution analysis above, the oxides can be defined as Cu2O, and similar EDS results were not displayed repeatedly in this paper.\nMaterials 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 17\nTo compare the thickness of oxides on different surfaces, cross-sectional slices were cut and picked up by FIB, which included the substrate, oxides and deposited Pt layer.

More negative OCP for Cu (111) indicated unstable oxides on the electrode. According to SEM morphologies and constitution above, Cu2O formed immediately on SCs, which led to the obvious increase in potential in the initial stage. Both SCs reached to peak at around 24H, but the OCP of Cu(111) decreased at once when the maximum arrived. This might be the less stability of oxides on Cu(111), as the coarser surface in Figure 5b shows. The higher potential of Cu(100) at last can also prove well protection of oxides on it."

It was said that (111) planes in face-centered cubic (FCC) metals with the highest atomic density showed excellent corrosion resistance. However, E.M. [8] and S.O. [12] thought that airformed oxide film was responsible for corrosion resistance instead of bare metals. In electrolyte containing Cl\u2212, the dissolution process is strengthened due to the prototypical activator of Cl\u2212 [43]. Thus, the reaction of Cl\u2212 and Cu2O contributed to the abnormal corrosion behavior of Cu(100)/Cu(111) in this paper. Furthermore, G.D [44] suggested that the larger average adsorption energy of Cl\u2212 on Cu2O {111}-type surfaces accelerated the dissolution of Cu2O. Therefore, a more drastic dissolution of air-formed Cu2O on Cu(111) explained the smaller\nMaterials 2023, 16, 1740 10 of 15\nradius of the capacitive loop. The opposite variation after 24H OCP might be the combination of exposed substrate and deposited oxides. From Figure 2, the dissolution process led to plenty of pits on Cu(100) and oxides in other areas. Additionally, Cu(111) showed a different style in that much dissolution occurred under the surface instead of exposing the substrate totally. It was reasonable to infer that the partially dissolved oxides protected the underlying substrate. Oxides formed in other areas also contributed to the increased capacitive loop on Cu(111). By contrast, uniformly distributed pits on Cu(100) without any protection showed a decrease in the capacitive loop. Finally, capacitive loops of both SCs increased, and the loop\u2019s radius of Cu(100) was larger than that of Cu(111) at a considerable margin after 10D corrosion. This can be predicted that oxides with different appearances formed on both SCs from surficial and sectional morphology. The much larger capacitive loop without a tail in low frequency symbolized a compact oxides layer combined tightly with the substrate, shown by the almost perfect interface in Figure 3a. The separation of oxide and substrate at the interface was deleterious to corrosion resistance. Electrolytes can directly damage substrate as soon as electrolyte passes through the defects in oxides. A more rugged surface might also reduce the stability of deposited oxides due to the larger superficial area exposed in the electrolyte. The corrosion resistance for samples can be evaluated with absolute impedance (|Z|f=0.01 Hz) at a low frequency [38,39,45] (by bode magnitude plots (Figure 7b)), and the exact values were extracted as a histogram in Figure 7d. From the histogram, the impendence of Cu(100) were unambiguously larger than that of Cu(111) in different stages consistent with the variation in the capacitive loop in Nyquist, especially Cu(100) after 10D OCP with an impedance of 13,115 \u2126\u00b7cm2. A potentiodynamic scan was supplied finally to validate the electrochemical behavior during EIS disturbance, as shown in Figure 8. Corresponding surficial morphologies of corroded samples were also displayed. From the polarization curves, Cu(111) SC obtained higher OCP potential (Ep) and smaller corrosion current density (icorr) compared with Cu(111) SC. One more obvious distinction was that a narrow passive range was detected during the positive zone of Cu(100) SC. It was noted that the drastic dissolution during the polarization scan uncovered the faceted planes sharply. The hierarchical rectangular steps led to the inverted quadrangular pyramid on Cu(100) SC. A macroscopic pyramid can be visualized on Cu(111) SC, which confirms the reliability of the faceted (100) planes. The air-formed film was reduced, and bare metals were exposed during the polarization of the negative zone. As a result, a higher OCP of Cu(111) SC was observed as conventional surface energy theory predicted. Cu(111) planes with the highest atomic density showed smaller icorr in the active dissolution zone. However, Cu(100) SC showed slight passive capability, which may be caused by more compact Cu2O on it. This was consistent with larger impendence in EIS and perfect interface in sectional morphology.

            "text": "During EIS disturbance, the electric current is uniformly distributed over the entire surficial area in high frequencies, presenting the response of the whole surficial area. However, the current concentrated at the pores in low frequencies, presenting active corrosion at defects [20]. Furthermore, the broadening of the phase angle curve in medium frequencies was probably the result of time constants overlapping [18,46], which resulted in only a one-time constant. Accordingly, the empirical data obtained from EIS measurements were fitted suitably with the EECs in Figure 9. The extracted data from EIS are listed in Table 2. For easy recognition, the abbreviation of ECs of different EIS was also summarized in Table 3. The EEC of Cu(100) SC was plotted, as shown in Figure 9a, where Rs represented the resistance of the solution and the high-frequency circuit Co symbolized the capacitance of the air-formed oxide film. The parameter groups Rct/Cdl represented double-layer capacitance and charge transfer resistance. Compared with normal two capacitances [47], the resistance of air-formed oxide film (Ro) was absent. It is inferred that Ro was too small to be detected due to the ultrathin air-formed oxide film, which was usually reported as tens of nanometers. Unlike the compact Al2O3 film [21], the protection of oxide film on copper was less efficient in retarding the penetration of electrolytes. As a result, the Rct/Cdl was detected at the interface between oxide and substrate as 4548 \u2126\u00b7cm2 and 2.89 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u00b5F\u00b7cm\u22122, respectively. Cu(111) SC used the same scenario to describe the interface response but with a decreased Rct and a larger Cdl. Rct is an important parameter that is directly dependent on active protection [48]. The value of Rct was usually inversely proportional to the corrosion rate of the test sample [28,49]. Smaller Rct suggested that a more drastic charge transfer occurred on Cu(111) SC. This process can be illustrated in Figure 10a,d, where Cl\u2212 preferentially adsorbed on the air-formed film on Cu2O {111}-type planes. Yan [50] reported that the initial orientation-dependent corrosion behavior was linked to the surface equivalent atomic packing density. The different protective abilities of the passive films resulted in different degrees of damage. K.H [15] suggested that after initial corrosion, the atomic composition of the (111) pyramidal plane was thought to be a combination of the (100) basal plane and the (011) diagonal plane. As a result, the equivalent corrosion tendency of the (111) oriented plane was higher than that of the (001) oriented plane. Herein, the oxides formed easily on SCs as the abrupt increase in OCP in the initial stage (Figure 6). Therefore, the corrosion resistance in this paper should be closely related to the air-formed film or deposited oxides throughout the whole corrosion process. This specific adsorption on Cu(111) caused the premature dissolution of air-formed film, which was well consistent with a smaller capacitive loop in Nyquist.

The bare substrate was exposed, as Figure 2a,c shows. Figure 10b,e explained the increased impendence of Cu(111) after 24H corrosion. Some dissolution occurred through the leaks of deposited oxides rather than complete exposure of the substrate. The corresponding EC was plotted, as shown in Figure 9b. The extracted Rct for Cu (100) SC was approximately twice that of Cu(111) SC. However, if only bare substrate was considered, the latter would acquire larger resistance due to the largest atomic density. It was inferred that deposited oxides started to play a dominant role after 24H corrosion, and more compact oxides on Cu(100) SC contributed to fine resistance. Furthermore, the larger diffusion impendence Zw (7071 \u03a9\u00b7cm2\u00b7s\u22121/2) of Cu(111) SC may be caused by the more tortuous channels in the thicker oxides on Cu(111). However, the total impendence of Cu(100) was still larger than that of Cu(111) (6028 \u03a9\u00b7cm2 +5417 \u03a9\u00b7cm2\u00b7s\u22121/2 > 3070 \u03a9\u00b7cm2 + 7071 \u03a9\u00b7cm2\u00b7s\u22121/2), which suggested a more protective ability of oxides on Cu(100). After 10D corrosion, oxide with ~1 \u03bcm thickness was deposited on both SCs, but their properties varied widely. As Figure 10c,f showed, the interface between oxides and Cu(111) was defective, and electrolytes can penetrate the substrate through channels in\nFigure 10.

As Figure 10c,f showed, the oxides and Cu(1 ) was defective, and electrolytes can penetrate th sub trate through channels in the coarse oxides (bluish lines). Moreover, the interface between oxides and Cu(100) showed fewer defects and was more compact. The matched EC for Cu(100) was Figure 9c, where a compact oxides layer formed on Cu(100) SC, and the electrolyte hardly penetrated the\nMaterials 2023, 16, 1740 13 of 15\nsubstrate. All parameters were involved with the properties of the oxides layer, and the compact layer accounted for the largest capacitive arc in EIS. Figure 9d shows a typical two-time constant EEC for Cu(111) SC. The red lines showed the channel of the penetration, and Rct/Cdl symbolized the interface of S/M. It was noted that the Cdl of Cu(111) SC was one magnitude order larger than that of Cu(100) SC. Capacitance is a key parameter to evaluate the amount of water penetration. The amount of water penetration into the porous oxides affected the dielectric constant of the oxides. Since the dielectric constant of water is much higher than semiconductors. The dielectric constant of porous oxides increased, with electrolyte penetrating into oxides. Furthermore, the Rct of Cu(100) exceeded Rct+Ro of Cu(111) at a larger margin (14,274 \u2126\u00b7cm2 > 4117 \u2126\u00b7cm2 + 5306 \u2126\u00b7cm2). Thus, the compactness of the passive film on the (001) surface planes was greater than those on the (111) surface planes, which was consistent with the results of the microstructural analysis."

            "heading": "4. Conclusions",
            "text": "EIS with different prolonged durations was conducted, and various behaviors were detected in different corrosion stages. The following conclusions can be drawn: In the initial stage, corrosion behavior was decided by air-formed oxide film instead of bare metal itself. The film on Cu(111) SC exhibited a higher possibility to dissolved due to the preferential adsorption of Cl\u2212 on Cu(111) planes, which resulted in a smaller capacitive loop during the EIS test. After 24H, corrosion, dissolution and deposition occurred simultaneously. The dissolution process leads to the exposure of faceted (100) crystal planes macroscopically. The bottom of the indentation in Cu(100) SC was not flat, and it was shown as extensive rectangular steps microscopically. The inverted pyramids can be understood as the orthogonal side walls of one cubic corner on the Cu(111) SC surface. Both SCs showed straight lines in low frequency of Nyquist diagrams, which suggested an obvious mass diffusion process. After prolonged corrosion, compact oxides and less defective interfaces formed on Cu(100), which contributed to the good protection of oxides and a larger capacitive loop in Nyquist. Moreover, a defective interface with leaks and the uneven surface formed on Cu(111), and then the electrolyte penetrated the substrate through channels in the defective oxides.\nAuthor Contributions: Q.L.: Methodology, Data Curation, Conceptualization and Writing\u2014Original Draft Preparation.
