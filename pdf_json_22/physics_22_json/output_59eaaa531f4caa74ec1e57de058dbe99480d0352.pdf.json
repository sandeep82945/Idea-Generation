The radiative heat exchange is due to the difference between the Poynting vectors generated by the fluctuating currents when the CNTs are at different temperatures. The radiated and absorbed Poynting vectors are expressed in terms of the correlations of the electromagnetic fields obtained from the Green\u2019s function and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the current density. The analysis takes into account the scattering of the fields by the nanotubes. We show that the radiative heat transfer depends not only on the distance between nanotubes, but also on their chiralities and thus on their semiconducting or metallic nature, which would allow the design of nanostructures for optimal radiative heat exchange.",

The radiative heat exchange is due to the difference between the Poynting vectors generated by the fluctuating currents when the CNTs are at different temperatures. The radiated and absorbed Poynting vectors are expressed in terms of the correlations of the electromagnetic fields obtained from the Green\u2019s function and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the current density. The analysis takes into account the scattering of the fields by the nanotubes. We show that the radiative heat transfer depends not only on the distance between nanotubes, but also on their chiralities and thus on their semiconducting or metallic nature, which would allow the design of nanostructures for optimal radiative heat exchange.\nIn their study of radiative heat transfer between two infinite parallel plates at different temperatures, Polder and van Hove1 showed that it is possible to exceed the value of the radiated energy, established by Planck\u2019s law, when the distance between the plates is small enough for evanescent waves to contribute to the radiation, in the socalled near-field limit. This result was obtained under the assumption that thermal radiation is generated by the presence of fluctuations of electromagnetic fields, which are also responsible for some other phenomena such as thermal emission, van der Waals interactions, Casimir effect and van der Waals friction between two bodies2. Rytov\u2019s fluctuational electrodynamics3 provides the theoretical framework to analyze the effect of fluctuations.\nRadiative heat transfer arises from the difference between the Poynting vectors associated with the fluctuating electromagnetic fields that one object generates in the other when the two are at different temperatures. The Poynting vector is obtained from the distribution of electromagnetic fields in the objects, which are calculated using Green\u2019s functions. This explains why radiative heat transfer depends on the geometry of the objects, as shown in4,5.\nThe important contribution of the evanescent waves in near-field radiative heat transfer has been reported for different basic configurations such as dipole-plate, dipole-dipole, sphere-sphere, sphere-plate, cylinder-cylinder, cone-plate, cone-cone and ring-ring6\u201319. The impact of radiative heat transfer on thermal technologies has been reviewed in20.\nWhen the plates are made of graphene, near field heat transfer shows new behaviours that have been the subject of recent studies. It has been found to depend on doping and electron relaxation time, with maximum transfer observed at low doping and when the plasmons of the two graphene sheets are in resonance21. Also, the coupling of surface plasmon polaritons and surface phonon polaritons results in a colossal enhancement of the energy transmission coefficient and radiation spectra22. It has recently been shown that near field heat transfer can be significantly enhanced in multilayered graphene structures23.\nIn this article, we will analyze a new aspect of the near field radiative heat transfer between graphene structures. We will show that the near-field heat transfer between two CNTs depends significantly on their chiralities which dictate their metallic or semiconducting behaviour. It also depends on the relaxation time of the surface conductivity. The radiative heat transfer is higher when the nanotubes are metallic than when they are semiconducting and when one is metallic and the other semiconducting. Metallic CNTs are therefore optimal structures for heat exchange.\nThe article is organized as follows. In \u201cThe system of two carbon nanotubes\u201d section, we present the model for the system of two CNTs. In \u201cElectromagnetic fields\u201d section, we compute the electromagnetic fields from the Green\u2019s function formalism. In \u201cPoynting vector and radiative heat transfer\u201d section, we calculate the Poynting vectors and the radiative energy exchanged by the nanotubes at two different temperatures.

Their electronic properties are determined by the way the graphene sheet is rolled-up. Two integers m and n, combining into a dual index (m,\u00a0n), characterize different types of CNTs: n = 0 for zigzag, n = m for armchair, and 0 < n = m for chiral ones. CNTs can manifest either metallic or semiconductor properties, depending on the chiral angle determined by indices m and n25. Armchair CNTs are always metallic (no energy bandgap), zigzag CNTs with m = 3q , with q an integer, are also metallic. Other zigzag and chiral CNTs possess semiconductor properties. The radius of a nanotube can be expressed in terms of m and n as\nwhere b = 0.142\u00a0nm is the interatomic distance in graphene. In this paper, we will consider zigzag CNTs whose radii are given by\nwhere b = 0.142\u00a0nm is the interatomic distance in single-wall CNTs. We will use the surface conductivity model, developed in26 which is based on effective boundary conditions and Green\u2019s function methods and uses the \u03c0 -electron tight-binding approximation.

The radiative heat transfer between the CNTs can be obtained through the Poynting vector which is a bilinear form of the EM fields. Its average value is thus expressed in terms of correlations of the EM fields that can be computed from fluctuational electrodynamics3. We neglect the azimuthal currents in the CNTs because the axial component of the surface conductivity strongly dominates the azimuthal one due to quantum effects, hence Hz = 0 and the radiative heat transfer in the x-direction is expressed only through Hy and Ez.This assumption is justified when the diameters of the CNTs are small enough, of about 1 -1.5 nm smaller than the distance between them which is 10-20 nm The field components obtained from expressions (6)\u2013(10) are given by\nwhere we have omitted the dependence of fields and currents on \u03c9 .

The field components Ez(r), Hy(r) , and the current Jz(r) consist of contributions due to EM fluctuations and to the scattered (diffraction) fields, that will be respectively denoted by the indexes 0 and s. We then have: Ez(r) = E0z (r)+ Esz(r) , Hy(r) = H0y (r)+Hsy(r) , and Jz(r) = J0z (r)+ Jsz(r) . The total fields can be found by solving Eq.\u00a0(24) by the iteration method of the multiple scattering approach30,31.

            "text": "In this Section, we will present the most salient features of the near-field radiative heat transfer between different types of CNTs: metallic-metallic, metallic-semiconducting, and semiconducting-semiconducting. Metallic CNTs are of zigzag or armchair types whereas semiconducting CNTs are of zigzag type. The temperature of the first CNT is assumed to be 307\u00a0K which corresponds to the black-body thermal emission spectrum at about 18 THz. For simplicity, the temperature of the second CNT is taken as zero. The distance between both CNTs is 10\u00a0nm, and the relaxation time is 10\u221213\u00a0s for both CNTs, in the three cases considered.\nFigures\u00a02, 3, 4 and 5 show the results of the numerical integration over frequency of the Poynting vector, emitted by the first CNT. The integration stops when the integral converges which allow us to identify the frequency range contributing to the total thermal energy flow. In addition, we present results for the Poynting vector when scattering is considered or not. In the figure we plot the ratio between the total radiative heat transfer Sx and that obtained only by propagating waves S0 . It can be seen that the evanescent waves are dominant in the heat transfer.\nFigure\u00a02 illustrates the importance of scattering in metallic CNTs. For m1 = 6 , the Poynting vector obtained when the scattering is considered is more than seven times the value obtained when scattering is not taken into account. This result indicates the existence of multiple scattering between the highly conductive metallic CNTs. This difference decreases rapidly with increasing distance d. For example, if d = 20 nm, neglecting the scattering leads to an underestimation of the total heat transfer by about four times. It is observed that the lower the index m1 (the smaller the diameter of the CNT) the higher the total radiative heat transfer.

Both \u03c3 \u20321 and \u03c3 \u2032\u20321 do matter since \u03c3 \u2032\u2032 1 influence on the scattering. Note that for semiconducting CNTs both \u03c3 \u2032 and \u03c3 \u2032\u2032 are two orders of magnitud smaller than for metallic CNTs26. It is remarkable that the radiative heat flow carried only by the propagating waves is ten orders of magnitude smaller than the total flux.\nIn Fig.\u00a03, we compare the radiative heat flows between two metallic zigzag and two armchair CNTs. The m indices for both types of CNTs are taken in such a way that the radii were similar: R = 0.587\u00a0nm for zigzag CNTs and R = 0.610\u00a0nm for armchair CNTs. Comparison of the properties of different types of CNTs with equal radii is difficult as they take discrete values. The radiative heat transfer between zigzag CNTs is slightly higher. If scattering is ignored, the curve (in red) is close to the others.\nFigure\u00a04 illustrates the spectral dependence of the radiative heat transfer calculated for armchair CNTs with different radii determined by Eq.\u00a0(1) with m1 = n1 = m2 = n2 . Figure\u00a05 depicts the radiative heat exchange between CNTs when the first one has semiconducting properties and the second one metallic. We assume that the chiral index of the second CNT is m2 = 12 . There are two significant differences with respect to the previous case. First, the total heat transfer is almost four orders of magnitude lower than in the case of two metallic CNTs. This result is due to the lower conductivity of semiconducting CNTs. Secondly, the effect of scattering is very\n/2 (THz)\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\nS x (\nW /m\n)\n1\n2\n3\n4 5 6\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\nFigure\u00a02.

The fields radiated by the first semiconductor CNT are scattered by the second metallic CNT, but do not excite any significant current in the first CNT, except for that induced by thermal fluctuations. For the same reason, the radiative heat transport between two semiconducting CNTs is much weaker than when both are metallic and similar to that when one is semiconducting and the other metallic as discussed above. Thirdly, unlike in the case of two metallic CNTs, the larger the index m1 and consequently the radius of the CNT, the larger the total heat flux.\nCalculation of the Poynting vectors have been carried out by using the values of the real and imaginary parts of \u03c31 represented in Fig.\u00a06. Both parts contribute to the result since \u03c3 \u2032 is included in the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and \u03c3 \u2032\u2032 influences the scattering. For semiconducting CNTs \u03c3 \u2032 and \u03c3 \u2032\u2032 are two orders of magnitude smaller than for metallic CNTs. We can also see in the figure that for CNTs with a lower index m1 the real and imaginary parts of \u03c31 are larger.\nFigure\u00a07 displays the dependence of the radiated heat flux on the relaxation time \u03c4 responsible for the losses. This parameter can be estimated from the interaction of electrons with longitudinal acoustic phonons34. Calculations have been implemented for larger distance between CNTs than in previous cases, d = 20\u00a0nm. How it depends on frequency is still a matter of debate. At low frequencies of about a few terahertz, it is usually taken as 10\u221212 to 10\u221213\u00a0s (see Refs.26,35,36). At higher infrared frequencies (below optical transitions) the value is \u03c4 = 10\u221213 to 10\u221214\u00a0s (see Ref.37). Due to the difficulty in determining this parameter, we have studied how the radiative\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 /2 (THz)\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n10 14\nS (J\n/m )\nFigure\u00a04.

The figure shows that the heat transfer increases with relaxation time. The results start from \u03c4 = 0.01 ps. The red curve 2 corresponds to the case of absence of scattering by the CNTs.\nFinally, Fig.\u00a08 illustrates how the radiative flow decreases with increasing the distance between the nanotubes. The results are normalised to the maximum values of the radiative flux which are 1.221\u00a0W/m for \u03c4 = 10\u221213\u00a0s, and 0.311\u00a0W/m for \u03c4 = 10\u221214\u00a0s, respectively. They are given on a logarithmic scale due to the rapid drop in radiative heat transfer."

            "text": "In this article, we have studied the radiative heat transfer between two CNTs. Carrying out this study for these particular structures is important, as they are often found in many condensed matter, electronic, and biological applications. We have shown that the heat transfer is dependent on the distance between the nanotubes, their chiralities, their nature: metallic or semiconducting, and the relaxation time of the surface conductivity.\nIn the calculation, we have considered the CNTs to be parallel and infinitely long and have therefore presented the radiative heat transfer per unit length. We have assumed that the azimuthal currents on the CNT surfaces are negligible because the azimuthal component of the surface conductivity is much larger than the axial one, along the z-coordinate. Furthermore, we have considered a homogeneous distribution of the azimuthal surface current. Our analysis takes into account the fields scattered by the nanotubes.
