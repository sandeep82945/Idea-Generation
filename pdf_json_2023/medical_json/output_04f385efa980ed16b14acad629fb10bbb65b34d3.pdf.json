    "abstractText": "The 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Professors James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo, not for the discovery of immune checkpoint molecules, but rather for the discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation (1). In the USA, the molecular discovery of CTLA-4 in 1987 (2) and its functional discovery in 1995 (3) led to the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab was approved for melanoma by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011. In contrast, immune checkpoint research in Japan began in 1992 with the cloning of the PD-1 molecule as a new immunoglobulin gene superfamily (4), and anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab was approved for the first time as an ICI by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in 2014 (Fig. 1). Now, nearly 10 years after PMDA approval of nivolumab, it is time for JJCO to publish comprehensive review articles on these topics. Kato et al. summarised recent advances in immunotherapy for advanced melanoma (5). In Japan, nivolumab was the first ICI to be approved for advanced melanoma in 2014, followed by ipilimumab in 2015. Acral melanoma and mucosal melanoma, subtypes of melanoma that are relatively more common in Japanese than in Caucasians, have been found to be less responsive to ICIs than cutaneous melanoma. The objective response rates of anti-PD-1 antibody monotherapy for acral melanoma were 15\u201330% and those for mucosal melanoma were 10\u201335%. The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab showed some improvement in efficacy against these melanomas, but the objective response rates of 33\u201343% remain unsatisfactory. In common cancers, ICI was initially introduced as a single agent after standard cytotoxic chemotherapy had failed. Phase III trials of ICI monotherapy versus chemotherapy showed efficacy of ICI monotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), urothelial cancer, head & neck cancer, and esophageal cancer, but long-term clinical benefits were obtained in only 10\u201320% of patients (6\u20139). Phase III trials of ICI monotherapies in gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, triple negative breast cancer, and glioma showed no significant benefit in second-line treatment (10\u201313). Exploratory phase II trials were conducted for other cancers, but the development as a single agent was terminated due to a lack of promising results (14,15). Thus, the therapeutic efficacy of single-agent ICIs was found to be limited. Accordingly, a large number of phase III trials attempted the combination of an ICI and standard chemotherapy with cytotoxic agents in the first-line setting. This approach is logical and ethical, since immunotherapy is considered more effective when used in the earlier line of therapy, and all patients who participate in such trials were eligible to receive the standard of care. Indeed, these trials successfully demonstrated that the addition of an ICI increased response rates, progression-free survivals, and overall survivals, as Figure 1.

Data for each drug can be found in the interview form for each drug.\nhad been expected (6\u20138,10,12,16). Thus, combination therapy with ICIs and cytotoxic anticancer agents has become the standard of care in many common cancers. Because adverse events (AEs) of these therapies occur additively rather than synergistically, each AE can be addressed individually and managed relatively easily in a familiar way. This is another reason why they are widely accepted. The combination therapy with two ICIs has been also used clinically in melanoma, renal cell cancer, NSCLC, and esophageal cancer in Japan, but how to deal with enhanced immune-related AEs is an urgent issue (5,6,8,17). Another important field is the combination of ICI and angiogenic inhibitors. Antibodies against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor, and multi-kinase inhibitors targeting VEGF receptor are administered together with an ICI in the treatment of NSCLC, hepatocellular, renal cell and uterine cancers (6,14,18,19). As the important role of vascular endothelial cells in tumor immunity becomes elucidated, expectations for these therapies are increasing, but further clinical experiences are needed before their clinical significance can be firmly established.\nSato et al. and Yotsukura et al. outlined the mechanisms, biomarkers, early clinical experience, and ongoing clinical trials for the combination of immunotherapy and radiotherapy or surgery, respectively (20,21). These combinations are important in the following four ways. One is the possibility of expanding the number of patients indicated for ICI and the opportunity for more cancer patients to receive the benefits of ICI. Second, by using ICIs in patients with earlier stages of cancer, they may be more effective in eliciting therapeutic effects. Third, it is expected that obtaining resected\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jjco/article/53/10/873/7236689 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\n874 Immune checkpoint inhibitors in Japan\nspecimens after administration of ICI will allow further research on the mechanism of ICI and biomarkers for ICI indications and longterm prognosis. Finally, limiting the duration of ICI administration may lower the cost of medical care. On the other hand, it should not be overlooked that patients who were originally cured by surgery alone or by radiotherapy alone may suffer for a long period of time from immune-related AEs.\nClearly, ICI appears to be pushing immunotherapy into one of the four pillars of cancer treatment alongside surgery, radiotherapy and conventional chemotherapy, enabling long-term remission of cancer comparable to cure and a return to normal daily life for patients (Fig. 2). With cancer drug therapy advancing at an extremely rapid pace, it is hoped that these review articles will be of use to readers (856 words)."
