    "abstractText": "It is important to clarify the effects of starch fine structure and protein components on the eating quality of indica rice. In this study, seven indica rice varieties with similar apparent amylose content (AAC) and protein content (PC) but different sensory taste values were selected and compared systematically. It was found that except for AAC and PC, these varieties showed significant differences in starch molecular structure and protein components. Compared with rice varieties with a low sensory taste value, varieties with a higher sensory taste value showed significantly lower amylose and higher amylopectin short chains (degree of polymerization 6\u201312) content; the protein component showed that the varieties with good taste value had higher albumin and lower globulin and glutelin content (p < 0.05). Rice varieties with lower AC, globulin, and glutelin content, as well as a higher content of albumin and amylopectin short chains, resulted in a higher swelling factor, peak viscosity, breakdown value, and ratio of hardness to stickiness, in which condition cooked rice showed a higher sensory taste value. Moreover, this study indicated that rice varieties with a higher content of albumin and amylopectin short chains were conducive to the good appearance of cooked rice. This study lays the foundation for the taste evaluation of good-tasting indica rice.",

            "text": "Improving rice quality is always an important goal for rice breeding. Rice quality includes appearance, processing, nutritional, and eating quality. Among them, eating quality is a complex trait, which is the most concerning trait among consumers. Eating quality, including the smell, appearance, texture, and taste of cooked rice, can be affected by apparent amylose content (AAC) and protein content (PC) [1,2]. Starch and protein are the most important components in rice grains, accounting for more than 80% and 6\u20139% of milled rice, respectively. Starch is composed of two major components: amylose and amylopectin. Previous studies suggested that rice with higher AAC is usually associated with a harder texture of cooked rice, and lower AAC can increase the viscosity of cooked rice [3]. Protein is the second main macromolecule in milled rice. Proteins affect the texture of cooked rice through a network linked by disulfide bonds that restrict the absorbance of water during the early stages of cooking [4,5]. Therefore, rice with high protein content usually has a harder texture. Okadome et al. [6] considered that the hardness of cooked rice is affected by starch, while the surface hardness is mainly related to protein content. Hence, reducing AAC and PC is an effective approach to improving the eating quality of indica rice. Some previous studies found that, in recent years, the AAC and PC of most indica rice varieties bred in southern China were stable, at 17\u201318% and 7\u20138%, respectively [7].\nFoods 2023, 12, 3535. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12193535 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2023, 12, 3535 2 of 15\nRecently, it was found that some indica rice varieties had similar AAC and PC, but they had significantly different eating qualities [8]. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish rice varieties with different eating qualities when mainly relying on AAC and PC. In addition to AAC and PC, amylopectin chain-length distribution can also affect rice quality [9,10]. For example, it has been found that medium-length amylopectin chains (DP 15\u201325) positively correlate with pasting temperature, while longer amylopectin chains (DP > 36) positively correlate with the final viscosity [9,11]. It was indicated that long amylopectin chains were positively linked with cooked rice hardness, while short amylopectin chains (DP < 70) showed significant negative correlations with hardness, which means rice varieties with high and long amylopectin chains had harder textures [12]. Li et al. [12] proved that a high proportion of long amylose chains (DP 1000\u20132000) was an important factor that could cause the harder texture of cooked rice. Moreover, other starch fine structures, such as starch granule size, were reported to be important parameters affecting the appearance of cooked rice [13]. Rice proteins can be classified into albumin, globulin, prolamin, and glutelin according to their solubility [14]. Previous studies demonstrated that prolamin and glutelin affected the texture of cooked rice significantly [14,15]. Furthermore, a Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA) and texture analyzer have often been used to study rice eating quality. As reported, the RVA profile, including elements such as peak viscosity and final viscosity, negatively correlated with the hardness of cooked rice, and rice with a lower setback value was more resistant to retrogradation after cooling [16]. The characteristics of cooked rice texture (e.g., hardness, stickiness, and springing) could well reflect the eating quality of cooked rice [12]. In order to better understand the effects of starch molecular structure and physicochemical properties on the eating quality of indica rice, seven indica rice varieties with similar AAC and PC were selected, and starch molecular structure, physicochemical properties, rice eating quality, and milled-rice grain shape were analyzed. This is because previous studies mainly focused on the effects of physicochemical properties on rice eating quality while ignoring the influence of milled-rice grain shape. Few studies have reported the effects of milled rice appearance on rice eating quality, yet rice is cooked in whole grains instead of as rice flour. It would help to understand the formation mechanism behind the eating quality of rice varieties with similar apparent amylose and protein contents and provide new information for the breeding of high-quality indica rice varieties."

Amylopectin chain-length distributions were significantly different among rice varieties. The Fa content of the GTVG was significantly higher than that of the MPTVG (p < 0.05). This was mainly because a higher proportion of Fb1 or AP1 could increase the stickiness of cooked rice and improve its mouthfeel [12]. Zhu et al. [31] compared two types of japonica rice, high AAC with low PC and low AAC with high PC, and concluded that high and short amylopectin content could create a looser gel network and softer-cooked rice. Peng et al. [8] chose hybrid indica rice with similar AAC as a material and found that rice with good taste values had a high proportion of intermediate chains (DP 13\u201324). Ayabe et al.

Except for the mouthfeel of cooked rice, the existence of a higher proportion of Fa could also enhance the eating quality by improving the cooked rice\u2019s appearance. This was because Fb1, the main component of the dissolved solids, could be dissolved from the rice grains during cooking [39], and it covered the surface of the rice grains to form a thin film.

The breakdown value (BV) was used to measure the disruption of the swelling starch structure, while the setback value (SV) was used to measure how readily cooked rice underwent retrogradation upon cooling.

            "text": "Hardness and stickiness were the most important textural properties of cooked rice. Rice varieties with a high eating quality generally had moderate hardness and high stickiness [12]. The hardness, stickiness, and hardness/stickiness ratio of cooked rice ranged\nFoods 2023, 12, 3535 11 of 15\nfrom 204 to 270 g, 450 to 860 g, and 0.24 to 0.56, respectively (Figure 5C\u2013E). As compared to the MPTVG, the GTVG had a significantly lower hardness of cooked rice and hardness/stickiness ratio and a significantly higher stickiness of cooked rice. These results were consistent with a previous study that found hybrid rice varieties with high taste values exhibited relatively high stickiness and low hardness [8]. It was suggested that AAC was the main factor affecting rice texture, as AAC was positively correlated with hardness and negatively correlated with the stickiness of rice [45,46]. In this study, the seven indica varieties had similar AAC and PC, and their rice/water ratio during cooking was the same. It was reported that the rice/water ratio was also an important factor influencing the texture of cooked rice [12]. Therefore, the cooked rice texture was affected by starch fine structure and protein composition. During cooking, rice expansion caused starch granule ruptures, which made the cooked rice less hard. Meanwhile, amylose, some AP long chains, and glutelin could interact with each other and restrict starch swelling [47]. Li et al. [12] used rice with different ACs (from 1.4% to 29.5%) as materials and suggested that AC was one of the most important parameters affecting the hardness of cooked rice. Therefore, the lower cooked rice hardness of the GTVG was mainly attributed to lower AC. Rice stickiness was caused by leached AM and AP chains, which were mainly affected by AP content [48]. Previous studies suggested that the high amount of short amylopectin chains would create a greater opportunity for bonding and molecular interactions in which case greater forces were required to separate the rice grains, eventually leading to higher stickiness [49]. Hence, the higher cooked rice stickiness of the GTVG was mainly caused by higher amylopectin Fa content."

            "text": "PCA plots were used to visualize the differences and similarities between the goodtaste-value group (GTVG) and medium- or poor-taste-value group (MPTVG). The first two principal components accounted for 65% of the total variance, with the first principal component (PC1) and the second principal component (PC2) accounting for 48.3% and 17.1% of the total variance, respectively (Figure 6). The MPTVG showed a wider variance compared with the GTVG. PC1 was mainly linked to sensory taste value, AC, glutenin content, and ratio of hardness to stickiness. PC2 was mainly linked to Fa, Fb2 contents, pasting temperature, and chalkiness degree. According to factor loading and sample score maps, it was suggested that sensory evaluation characteristics were the most effective parameters to distinguish the eating quality of indica rice varieties with similar AAC and PC. Furthermore, starch fine structure (AC, Fa, etc.), glutenin content, and the ratio of hardness to stickiness could also be used to assess the eating quality of indica rice varieties.
