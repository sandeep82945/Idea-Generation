However, the prevalence of these COVID-19-related disorders and their associated factors remain unclear. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the prevalence rates of insomnia, PTSD, COVID-19-related self-stigma, and smartphone addiction, along with the identification of risk factors and protective factors for Taiwan frontline government workers with COVID-19 pandemic control duties. Methods: The survey was carried out with 151 participants between September and October 2021. All participants completed the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (assessing fear of COVID-19), Self-Stigma Scale (assessing self-stigma during the COVID-19 pandemic), Smartphone Application-Based Addiction Scale (assessing the risk of smartphone addiction), Insomnia Severity Index (assessing insomnia), Impacts of Event Scale-6 (assessing PTSD), and a self-designed set of questions assessing trait resilience. Results: The results showed that the prevalence rate was 31.1% for insomnia and 33.8% for PTSD. Furthermore, service duration (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.86, 0.999) and trait resilience (AOR = 0.19; 95% CI = 0.08, 0.46) were protective factors and fear of COVID-19 (AOR = 1.91; 95% CI = 1.02, 3.57) was a risk factor for insomnia. Fear of COVID-19 (AOR = 2.63; 95% CI = 1.35, 5.14), self-stigma (AOR = 3.62; 95% CI = 1.19, 11.02), and smartphone addiction (AOR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.001, 1.19) were risk factors, and trait resilience was a protective factor (AOR = 0.58; 95% CI = 0.29, 1.17) for PTSD. Conclusion: The findings demonstrated a high prevalence of insomnia and PTSD. Risk-reducing strategies and protective factor promotion strategies are recommended to help reduce the symptoms of insomnia and PTSD among Taiwan frontline government workers.

As a frontline government worker, village officers have the extra responsibility of managing quarantined residents. Job duties include such activities as monitoring the health status of quarantined residents, participating in the disinfection of confirmed case \u2018footprint areas\u2019 (ie, places where confirmed cases have been identified by using information supplied by individuals infected with COVID-19 via smartphone QR codes), and delivering meals to quarantined individuals.8 Such duties appear to cause the same psychological responses (eg, fear, anxiety, depression) as those among frontline healthcare workers. In addition, they have made various complaints due to the stress and concerns regarding their COVID-19 responsibilities. The overwhelming workload,9 insufficient knowledge of self-protection strategies,10 and fear of exposure to the virus11 may cause village officers to experience psychological distress,12 anxiety,9,12 depression,10,12 and self-stigma,13 which may further lead to the development of traumatizing symptoms such as insomnia12 and/or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).13\nFurthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the lifestyle and psychosocial health of individuals.14\u201321 The advice to \u201cstay at home\u201d17 increased the use of the internet and smartphones because of its various functions (eg, online meetings, social interaction, online food shopping).22,23 The psychological stress derived from COVID-19 may trigger problematic smartphone use (which in extreme cases has been referred to as \u201csmartphone addiction\u201d) for a small minority.24 Previous studies indicate that fear of COVID-1925,26 and poor mental wellbeing such as anxiety or depression27,28 may increase smartphone addiction because it allows the temporarily avoidance of reality.28 Moreover, research also indicates the associations between smartphone addiction, psychological distress25,27 and health issues such as insomnia via the influence on poor sleep quality29 and sleep deprivation.30\nThe cognitive models of insomnia31 and PTSD32 suggest that the excessive negative emotions may increase health risks and impair the quality of life.33,34 More specifically, worries and ruminations concerning the stressors may induce a series of psychological changes (eg, anxiety and depression) and eventually exacerbate the symptoms (eg, insomnia and PTSD). Trait resilience is a potential factor that could minimize the negative impacts of insomnia and PTSD35 among individuals. Trait resilience has specifically been defined as a personal trait, which benefits individuals in coping with traumatic events36 and provides the ability for self-adaptation to deal with stressors37 and achieve positive adjustment.36 Individuals who possess lower or weaker resilience are more likely to experience psychological distress.38,39 In contrast, enhancing resilience level may help the individuals to deal with negative psychological mood states.40\nThe therapeutic process of prolonged exposure (PE) in the habituation model (ie, a behavioral model that allows individuals to become accustomed to a specific stimulus by repeated exposure to that stimulus) can help reduce negative psychological responses. The structural contact to the fear stimulus with minimal possibility of avoidance or escape41 makes PE a commonly used treatment for PTSD with the reported effect of reducing emotional distress.42 A recent study indicated that individuals have become accustomed to the \u201cnew way of living\u201d with COVID-19 which has subsequently reduced their anxiety, consequently making \u201ccontinued living with COVID-19\u201d become a form of PE.43 Similarly, service duration of village chiefs can be seen as a type of PE to the stimulus and could have an anticipatory benefit in reducing the level of psychological distress in relation to COVID-19 and the likelihood of insomnia and/or PTSD.\nHowever, there are knowledge gaps among frontline government workers regarding (i) insomnia and PTSD during COVID-19 in Taiwan and (ii) potential risk factors and protective factors for insomnia and PTSD. Therefore, the main purpose of the present study was to estimate the prevalence rate of insomnia and PTSD, as well as the COVID-19related self-stigma and smartphone addiction among frontline government workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan. Among this cohort, the study also investigated the (i) association between psychological distress, insomnia, PTSD and smartphone addiction and (ii) protective effect of trait resilience and service duration on insomnia and PTSD.\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S383842 DovePress Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2022:15 3070\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)"

Extra assignments regarding quarantined residents, such as providing health tracking, delivering meals, and collecting trash, were required during the COVID-19 pandemic. The overall number of village officers in Taiwan is approximately 8000.\nThe present study\u2019s protocol was approved by Human Research Ethics Committee of NCKU (HREC ref: NCKU HREC-E-110-121-2). Moreover, the present study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. The survey was administered directly to the village officers in the township office of Taipei and Tainan during September to October, 2021. All participants provided written informed consent for participation. A total of 181 village officers participated in the survey but 30 did not complete the whole survey.

The consequent fear of COVID-19, along with psychological distress (eg, anxiety, depression) has initiated a series of psychological changes contributing to the poor health (eg, insomnia and PTSD).12,13,62 The fear originating from being near to possibly infected quarantine residents (ie, delivering meals or collecting daily trash), as well as the self-stigma derived from a public perspective, has become a large psychological burden on frontline workers (eg, healthcare providers),13 as seems to be the case among village officers in Taiwan. Moreover, excessive worry caused by the fear of COVID-1956 was one of the predominant factors that contributed to clinical insomnia.63 It has affected sleep quality58 and has led to hyperarousal,64,65 which has been reported in the pathophysiology of insomnia64 and is also a theoretical subtype of PTSD.65 In addition, the symptom of hyperarousal has been reported to be more highly prevalent among healthcare workers who experience high exposure to stressors.58,66 Therefore, it is anticipated that these psychological distresses and poor mental health can gradually develop into advanced health issues of insomnia and PTSD due to the long-term ongoing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nStudies have reported that fear (an immediate and intensive emotion which was particularly derived from medical vulnerability or excessive worries) is one of the critical factors associated with PTSD,66 self-stigma,67 and smartphone addiction.61 The present study\u2019s findings agree with these prior findings.61,66,67 Discrimination from the public (eg, unfriendly attitudes) caused unpleasant psychological burden and has provoked self-stigma among frontline workers.69,70 It also influences the perception and understanding regarding the disease,71 and may further result in vulnerability of individuals facing the potential consequences, including self-stigma and smartphone addiction.71 A higher level of selfstigma has been reported to be associated with psychological distress,72 which might elicit a series of pathological changes to develop into PTSD.58\nTo the best of the present authors\u2019 knowledge, this is also the first study to investigate smartphone addiction among frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Smartphone use provides a temporary escape and psychological support28 for individuals to cope with psychological stress25,26,61 and avoiding negative emotion.68 However, the increasing frequency and duration of smartphone use might be associated with problematic use.73 Moreover, smartphone addiction has been reported to be a mediator in the association between COVID-19 and PTSD.68 Individuals with smartphone addiction have been reported as lacking impulsive control,74 which is also a subcategory of PTSD.75 In\nPsychology Research and Behavior Management 2022:15 https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S383842 DovePress 3075\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\naddition, exposure to artificial light,79 especially at-night blue light from the smartphone,80 may increase the incidence rate of sleep disorder and further lead to insomnia.79 Consequently, smartphone addiction may exacerbate the development of insomnia and PTSD.\nResilience was identified as a protector of insomnia and PTSD in the present study, which concurs with the findings of several previous studies.38,39,76 This indicates that trait resilience acts as a self-protector38 to benefit individuals in stressful situations. Studies show that individuals with higher resilience have a lower chance of developing negative emotional symptoms39 and higher resilience successfully predicts lower levels of PTSD symptoms.76 Some researchers believe that resilience protects individuals by enhancing self-esteem77 and positive influence,78 while others believe that resilience \u201crestrains\u201d individuals from being trapped in negative thoughts.81 Both beliefs explain the ability of resilience to protect individuals from developing negative psychological mood states and inhibiting the occurrence of insomnia and"

            "text": "It is likely that the longer service duration allows village officers to have more experience in dealing the stress event (ie, the village officers experience PE and become habituated as a consequence of their job duties). One study reported that repeated and prolonged exposure to a stressor enables individuals to build up the tolerance to psychological distress (eg, anxiety) as a corrective learning.42 Interestingly, individuals who do not present with diminishing psychological distress can still have reduced post-traumatic symptoms.82 That is, even though there was no improvement in reducing psychological distress, individuals might still benefit from PE by having decreased unpleasant psychological responses. The key point may be attributed to habituation,83 which allows individuals to tolerate negative psychological impacts43,83\nand weakens the effect of stress. The results of the present study have implications in helping reduce the symptoms of insomnia and PTSD among\nfrontline government workers. For example, the risk factor of fear of COVID-19 could be reduced by providing knowledge regarding information concerning COVID-19 (such as personal hygiene as an effective COVID-19 preventive strategy)63 or providing essential protective equipment to reduce excessive worries and anxiety. Additionally, destigmatization may benefit the individuals84 via the improvement of public\u2019s disease perceptions83 or stigma coping skills such as empowerment or help-seeking behavior.84 All these interventions can potentially alleviate the psychological distress85 while conducting job duties of disease control and prevention. Furthermore, strategies (such as mindfulness) to improve the protective factors (eg, resilience) are recommended to help enhance the individual\u2019s ability to cope with the stressor. Maintaining routine physical activity86 or providing psychological support for the frontline government workers40 could help promote self-control and allow the individuals to gain positive effects, further improving resilience.\nThe present study has several limitations. First, the study used convenience sampling to collect the data. Therefore, the results might be limited due to the similar context and features of regional effect and were not representative for the results to be generalized to other countries. Second, a cross-sectional design was adopted. Therefore, the study was unable to determine the cause-and-effect relationship and protective effect of increasing service duration. Third, the measures in the present study used self-reported evaluation, which might have self-report bias. Fourth, the present study had a relatively small sample size. More specifically, the responses collected comprised less than 13% of the total population of village officers in the areas examined. The relatively small number of participants may result in a weaker statistical power and a biased estimation in the prevalence reported in the present study."

The results suggest that despite the relatively low infection rate, frontline government workers had a relatively high prevalence of insomnia, PTSD, and risk of smartphone addiction. Moreover, fear of COVID-19, self-stigma, and risk of smartphone addiction were potential risk factors for insomnia or PTSD, while trait resilience and service duration were potential protective factors. Based on the findings, the psychological health of frontline government workers should be taken seriously. Strategies to reduce the fear of COVID-19, such as providing knowledge regarding COVID-19, or strategies to improve resilience, such as\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S383842 DovePress Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2022:15 3076\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nmaintaining daily physical activity, would likely benefit individuals and further reduce the incidence of insomnia or PTSD among this particular cohort."
