            "text": "Adolescence is a key period in individual physical and mental development. It is also a period in which depression can easily occur (1). A meta-analysis found that the detection rate of Chinese adolescent depressive symptoms was 28.4% (2). Depressive symptoms have an important impact on the academic performance of adolescents, their social adaptation, and their physical/mental health (3). The high detection rate and negative effects of depressive symptoms show the necessity to study their occurrence and development. Recently, an emerging body of research has paid more attention to heterogeneity in the development of adolescent depressive symptoms and the factors of family, peers, and other aspects (4\u20136). However, few studies have explored the trajectories of Chinese early adolescent depressive symptoms or considered the factors of family and peers comprehensively. The present study aimed to identify the different trajectories of depressive symptoms during early adolescence, recognize the family and peer predictors, add new evidence for empirical research, and provide practice guidance.\nThe heterogeneity of the development of adolescent depressive symptoms\nHeterogeneity and individual differences exist in the occurrence and development of adolescent depressive symptoms (7). Person-centered approaches (such as cluster analysis, latent class analysis, and latent growth mixture modeling) focus on the relationships among individuals, and the goal is to classify individuals into distinct groups or categories based on individual response patterns so that individuals within a group are more similar than individuals between groups. Latent class growth analysis (LCGA) is a special type of latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM), whereby the variance and covariance estimates for the growth factors within each class are assumed to be fixed to zero. By this assumption, all individual growth trajectories within a class are homogeneous. The benefit of this approach is the identification of distinct classes prior to conducting LGMM. It serves as a starting point for conducting LGMM. In terms of computation, it is easy to specify in Mplus and the zero constraints on the variance estimates allow for faster model convergence (8). Many researchers used LCGA to identify the heterogeneous trajectories of different classes of adolescent depressive symptoms (4\u20136). These results supported the trajectories of three or four classes. A meta-analysis of 18 studies on the developmental trajectories of adolescent depressive symptoms showed that a four-class trajectory was the best-fitting model: ongoing stable-low levels of depressive symptoms; very high depressive symptoms initially, but a steep decrease in symptoms over time; moderately high depressive symptoms initially, but symptoms decreasing over time; initially low levels of symptoms increasing over time (5). The latest\nstudy on Chinese early adolescents identified four trajectories of depressive symptoms: low stability, low growth, medium growth, and medium reduction (6). Among the four different trajectories, some classes, such as low stability, increasing, and decreasing to some extent exist stably. Previous studies have confirmed that most adolescents are characterized by low and stable depressive symptoms (5, 6, 9\u201311). Some studies suggest that depressive symptoms tend to increase slowly in early adolescence (usually 10\u201314 years old) (12, 13), and such adolescent subgroups were also confirmed in the later LCGA studies (11). In addition, many studies have found that a small number of adolescents show the characteristics of decreasing depressive symptoms, which cannot be ignored (14\u201317). Other LCGA studies also identified these three classes: stably low class, increasing class, and high-decreasing class (9, 18\u201321). Based on previous studies, we hypothesized three classes in the developmental trajectories of Chinese early adolescent depressive symptoms: stably low class, increasing class, and high-decreasing class.\nPredictors of the development of adolescent depressive symptoms\nThe development of adolescent depressive symptoms has different trajectories, which may be related to a series of individual and environmental factors. Gender is a key predictor of depressive symptoms. Gender differences in vulnerability to depressive symptoms in adolescence have been widely investigated (11, 22). The consensus is that females are more susceptible to depressive symptoms in adolescence (11, 23). The diathesis-stress model is an integrated perspective explaining the occurrence of diseases. The model shows that adolescents have innate susceptibility through genetic, endocrinal, biochemical, or environmental factors. These factors interact with psychological and social stressors to produce physical and mental problems (24). Some scholars believe that a genetic history of depression and psychosocial stressors are strong predictors of adolescent depression (3). The vast majority of adolescents with depression have experienced longterm social and psychological pressure, such as discord in family relations or disharmony in their parents\u2019 marriage, domestic violence, abuse, and neglect and school difficulties (such as bullying and academic failure), and social isolation (25). This kind of exposure to high levels and various forms of victimization was called poly-victimization, having even more harmful and less reversible effects on victims (26). The relation between poly-victimization and adolescent depressive symptoms has also been confirmed in Chinese culture (27\u201329). In addition, according to the interpersonal theory of depression (7), negative interpersonal experience makes individuals tend to form more negative cognitive schema and self-evaluation, and deterioration of self-cognition caused by negative interpersonal\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 02 frontiersin.org\nexperiences will continue to increase, eventually increasing the risk of depression (6). In early adolescence, in particular, individuals face a major process of psychological development during which they gradually separate from their parents and become more affected by their peers. Therefore, while individuals are affected by some family factors, peer factors play an increasingly important role.\nFamily predictors on the development of adolescent depressive symptoms\nThe family environment has a far-reaching impact on adolescent psychosocial development (30). Chinese culture also holds that family serves as a critical influencing aspect of depression (31). Some researchers have summarized the family factors that increase the risk of adolescent depression as follows: long-term family stress, negative parenting behaviors, low-level family support and attachment, neglect, and parents\u2019 marital conflict (32). Conflicts in the family environment can disrupt the core sense of security requisite for children\u2019s adaptive coping responses to stress so that increases the risk of depression (33, 34). It is believed that exposing children to violence between parents is a form of psychological abuse (35). An empirical study found that exposure to parents\u2019 aggression in marital conflicts (also called intimate partner violence) was a risk factor for adolescent depression (36). Witnessing is one of the major ways adolescents become exposed to intimate partner violence (37). A study has shown that witnessing intimate partner violence can positively predict depressive symptoms of Chinese college students (38). However, the effect of witnessing intimate partner violence on adolescent depressive symptoms was paid little attention in Chinese culture. More importantly, negative parent-child interactional factors, such as poor parenting style, parental emotional abuse, and neglect also have an important effect on the development of individual adaptability. A meta-analysis showed that parental emotional abuse and neglect were significantly and positively correlated with adolescent depressive symptoms (39), which could continue into adulthood (40). A large number of studies have found that parental emotional abuse and neglect increased the risk of adolescent depression in Chinese culture (41\u201344). Regarding parenting styles, parental control is the core content, including parental behavior control and psychological control (45). Parental behavior control usually includes openly regulating adolescent behaviors, such as establishing rules and boundaries, developing consistent discipline, and monitoring adolescent activities. However, psychological control is different. It refers to a manipulated parenting strategy in which parents aim to force adolescents to think and act in the same way as themselves (46). Parental psychological control interferes with independent adolescent development and causes continuous dependence (47), which was identified as a strong predictor of adolescent depression (48\u201350). A longitudinal study investigated the development\ntrajectories of parental psychological control perceived by adolescents, similar to the trajectories of adolescent depressive symptoms. It further indicated that parental psychological control was closely related to adolescent depressive symptoms (51). However, the relationship between parental behavior control and adolescent depressive symptoms has received less attention. Previous studies have a unified view that parental psychological control is more closely related to adolescent internalized problems (mainly depression and anxiety), while parental behavior control is more closely related to adolescent externalized problems (mainly bad behavior) (52). A later study found that parental behavior control significantly negatively predicted adolescents\u2019 depression, but this effect was masked by adolescents\u2019 personality traits (53). Parental behavior control often reflects parental care and love, which is often accompanied by positive reinforcement and verbal guidance. It may promote the improvement of adolescent psychological well-being, thus providing a buffer for the occurrence and development of depressive symptoms (54). A cross-cultural study also pointed out that in a culture where family intimacy is particularly valued, parental behavior control might predict less internalized problems in adolescence (55). Chinese culture places great emphasis on mutual support and intimacy between family members, where parental behavioral control might be a protective factor against depressive symptoms. The effect of parental behavioral control is not simply linear and only a moderate degree is the best (56). In short, witnessing intimate partner violence, parental psychological aggression/neglect, and psychological control were essential family factors that were closely related to adolescent depressive symptoms. We hypothesized that these family factors could predict the development of adolescent depressive symptoms.\nPeer predictors of the development of adolescent depressive symptoms\nThe supporting role and the potentially negative impact of peer relationships become evident in adolescence. Low level of peer attachment, peer rejection, and peer interaction related to victimization are key factors for adolescent depressive symptoms (57). Bullying is a common adverse peer factor, and it is a particular type of aggressive behavior. There is an imbalance of power between the parties involved (the victim has difficulties protecting themself from bullying), and it is repetitive and deliberate (58). Traditionally, bullying comes in three forms: verbal bullying, physical bullying, and relational bullying (58). Nowadays, bullying also occurs in cyberspace in the form of cyberbullying (59). As a new type of bullying, cyberbullying is destructive and extreme because it can happen anytime and anywhere, and the content of cyberbullying remains accessible after the event, which brings repeated harm to the victims (60). Previous studies have found that traditional bullying perpetration/victimization (61) and cyberbullying perpetration/victimization (62) were\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 03 frontiersin.org\nrelated to the increase in adolescent depressive symptoms. A cross-cultural study shows that bullies (during adolescence) in China had more depressive symptoms in adulthood compared to victims, which emphasizes the impact of bullying (63). Adolescents who bully others were found to have more psychological and physical problems than their peers and had an increased risk for depression (64). A recent study also found that both bullying perpetration and victimization were risk factors for adolescent depressive symptoms (65). Concurrently, researchers generally believe that high-quality interpersonal relationships have a significant protective effect on the occurrence and development of adolescent depressive symptoms (3). Adolescents can gain a sense of security, emotional support, and self-confidence in their interactions with friends (66). High friendship quality plays a protective role in the relationship between early childhood adverse experiences and depression (67). At the early stage, some researchers believed that friendship quality had a direct impact on adolescent depressive symptoms (68). Later, some longitudinal studies found that friendship quality had a significant negative prediction on adolescent depressive symptoms (57, 69). High friendship quality is not only the basis for the healthy development of adolescents but can also compensate, to a certain extent, for a bad family environment (70). In short, traditional bullying perpetration/victimization and cyberbullying perpetration/victimization were essential factors in the impact of peers, and they were closely related to adolescent depressive symptoms. We hypothesized these peer factors could predict the development of adolescent depressive symptoms."

It contains 20 items, including the four dimensions of depressed affect, positive affect, somatic and retarded activities, and interpersonal factors. The scale requires participants to evaluate the frequency of corresponding symptoms within a week (e.g., \u201cI\u2019m worried about some small things\u201d). Responses were given on a four-point frequency scale. 1 = \u201calmost never (less than once a day)\u201d to 4 = \u201cmost of the time (5\u20137 days).\u201d A higher mean score indicates more depressive symptoms. The questionnaire had good reliability and validity when used with Chinese adolescents (72). In the present study, the Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 for all items of each wave were 0.87, 0.88, and 0.90, respectively.\nWitnessing intimate partner violence The Chinese version of the revised Conflict Tactics Scales Questionnaire (73) was used to measure witnessing intimate partner violence. We used 25 of the items (the item about gun use was deleted for cultural reasons). We included the three dimensions of psychological aggression, physical violence, and injuries. Each item was responded to on a seven-point scale ranging from 1 (never) to 7 (almost every day). Participants were asked to use the scale to answer the frequency of witnessing violence between their father (or stepfather) and mother (or stepmother) (e.g., \u201cwitness their father/mother yelling at their\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 04 frontiersin.org\npartner\u201d). After reversing the items, the average score of all items was calculated. Higher scores indicated higher frequencies of witnessing intimate partner violence. CFA was conducted because it was the first time this questionnaire was used to measure Chinese adolescents witnessing intimate partner violence. The three-factor model provided a good fit for the data (\u03c72/df = 3.43, RMSEA = 0.06, CFI = 0.93, TLI = 0.91, SRMR = 0.03). In the present study, Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 was 0.95 in the first wave.\nParental psychological aggression and neglect\nA validated Chinese version of the parent-child Conflict Tactics Scale was used to measure parental psychological aggression and neglect (74, 75). Two subscales were selected: psychological aggression (e.g., \u201cfather/mother yelled at you\u201d) and neglect (e.g., \u201ceven if your parents think you should be accompanied by adults, your father/mother still left you at home alone\u201d), a total of 10 items. Each item was responded to on a seven-point scale ranging from 1 (never) to 7 (almost every day). After reversing the items, the higher mean score indicated that the individual suffers from more psychological aggression and neglect. The two-factor model provided a good fit for the data (\u03c72/df = 2.81, RMSEA = 0.04, CFI = 0.92, TLI = 0.91, SRMR = 0.04). In the present study, Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 was 0.83 in the first wave."

Parental behavior control and friendship quality were\nsignificantly and negatively correlated with baseline depressive symptoms.\nIdentification of depressive symptom trajectories\nAccording to the construction procedure proposed by Jung and Wickrama (8), an unconditional latent growth curve model was first fitted to the data. A cubic growth model, with quadratic and cubic variances fixed to zero to achieve a positive definite psi matrix, was used as a basis for subsequent analyses. The model provided good overall fit (\u03c72/df = 5.10, p = 0.020; RMSEA = 0.08, CFI = 0.99, TLI = 0.98, SRMR = 0.02). However, there were significant variances for the intercept (\u03c32 = 60.12, SE = 6.46, p < 0.001) and linear slope (\u03c32 = 5.86, SE = 2.98, p = 0.021), indicating that there were systematic differences in the trajectories of adolescent depressive symptoms among individuals. The single-class model did not adequately account for variation in adolescent depressive symptoms trajectories.\nNext, GMMs of 1\u20135 classes were used to explore subgroups with distinct symptom trajectories. For GMM models, means and slopes (linear, quadratic, and cubic) were allowed to vary between classes, and means and linear slopes were allowed to vary within classes, with quadratic and cubic slope variances fixed to zero within classes for model estimation purposes. Lower AIC, BIC, and adj. BIC values are indicative of a better model fit. Significant VLMR and BLRT tests favor the k class model over the k-1 class model. Higher entropy and latent class probabilities indicate greater parsimony and classification accuracy [Jung and Wikrama (8); Hill et al. (4)]. Table 2 shows the relative fit indices and numbers of people in each subgroup for all models.\nAdjusted BIC indicated that the four-class model was better.

            "text": "This study identified trajectories of depressive symptoms in early adolescence. Most adolescents belong to the stablelow class, a few adolescents belong to the increasing class, and the least number of adolescents belongs to the highdecreasing class. This study also found some significant family and peer predictors. Specifically, parental psychological aggression/neglect, parental psychological control, traditional bullying/cyberbullying victimization, and friendship quality were significant predictors. Based on the investigation of the short-term trajectories of depressive symptoms in early adolescence, this study is the first to examine how family and peer factors are related to the development of depressive symptoms in Chinese adolescents. The results of this study provide new evidence for the development and factors of depressive symptoms in Chinese adolescents.\nFirst, in the trajectories of early adolescent depressive symptoms, the majority of adolescents showed the characteristics of stable and low depressive symptoms. Their depressive symptoms were below the average level and did not fluctuate in follow-ups. The result was consistent with previous findings. The second class of adolescents showed elevated depressive symptoms. The characteristic of this class was that the baseline level was close to the average level but gradually became higher than the average level. In the last measurement, this class showed the highest depressive symptoms among the\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 07 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 1 Depressive symptoms trajectories.\nthree classes. Almost one-fifth of individuals belong to this kind of development trajectory. Similar results were found in previous studies (20, 21). This kind of adolescent deserves special attention because they might show an important tendency to clinical adolescent depression. The third class of adolescents showed high-decreasing depressive symptoms,\nwhich accounted for the smallest number in the population, only 5%. The class showed the highest baseline depressive symptoms level and a decline in development, but the overall level was still higher than the average. This study found the same conclusions as some long-term follow-up studies using short-term data, showing that the development of adolescent\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 08 frontiersin.org\ndepressive symptoms may be stable and continuous. Therefore, this study emphasizes the early identification and classification prevention of adolescent depressive symptoms.\nSecond, this study found some significant family and peer predictors of the trajectories of depressive symptoms in early adolescence. Specifically, for girls, parental psychological aggression and neglect, and traditional bullying/cyberbullying victimization were the risk factors for adolescents to show the trajectory of increasing depressive symptoms. For girls, the incidence rate of depression in early adolescence increased dramatically (22) to twice that of boys (82). Girls are more likely to show cognitive styles characterized by negative selfevaluation and rumination, and their emotional experience is more profound than that of boys, which makes adolescent women more likely to have depression (13). This study also emphasizes the adverse effect of parental psychological aggression and neglect. Individuals who grow up with bad parent-child interactions are difficult to form a powerful self or a healthy personality. Such adolescents are very vulnerable internally. When facing the huge physical and mental changes in adolescence, they are often unable to cope with it, which leads to depressive symptoms (40, 83). In addition, this study did not identify the impact of witnessing intimate partner violence on the trajectory of adolescent depressive symptoms. This might be related to the low incidence of intimate partner violence in the sample. Regarding peer predictors, contrary to the hypothesis, this study only found that traditional bullying and cyberbullying victimization were risk factors, while traditional bullying and cyberbullying perpetration could not predict the trajectory of depressive symptoms. The result was consistent with some previous research results (4, 64). Bullying victimization is a passive and negative peer interaction, resulting in a series of negative self-cognition and promoting the development of depressive symptoms (10). Meanwhile, bullying perpetration is a more active peer interaction, a way to express hostility and outward aggression. The participants of this study were in early adolescence. Some researchers believed that individuals who bullied others in early adolescence often seemed to be unscathed because their social status and self-concept were significantly better than those who were bullied. These young people were even regarded as positive leaders, with a good sense of humor, high self-esteem, positive early friendship, and popularity (84).\nIt is noteworthy that in the comparison between the stable-low class and the high-decreasing class, this study found that parental psychological control and traditional bullying and cyberbullying victimization were the risk factors, while friendship quality was the protective factor. Parental psychological control seemed particularly important for adolescents in the high-decreasing class. This study also identified the significant role of parental psychological control in comparing the high-decreasing class and the increasing\nclass, revealing the negative impact of parental psychological control, a form of parenting that destroys the development of autonomy and self-consciousness. The main ways of psychological control are guilt initiation and withdrawal of love (45). Guilt and self-aggression modes were easy to provoke in adolescents under psychological control for a long time. These modes promote the occurrence and development of depressive symptoms (51). This study also highlighted the protective effect of high-quality friendship. A positive peer reaction is a kind of external resource for adolescents, which can regulate the relationship between other risk factors and individual adaptive development, thus protecting the physical and mental health of adolescents (9). Adolescents need to develop good friendships and obtain peer support. However, this study did not find a significant effect of parental behavior control. Previous studies have paid more attention to the effect of parental behavioral control on adolescents\u2019 bad behaviors (such as problematic internet use and aggressive behavior) and found a protective effect (56, 85). Regarding emotions, one study found that parental behavior control has a positive predictive effect on adolescent generalized anxiety (86). As mentioned earlier, the effect of parental behavior control is complex and non-linear. On the one hand, behavior control can make individuals feel cared for and taken care of, on the other hand, it can also make individuals feel restricted and deprived of freedom (87). In short, the results of this study reveal the importance of parent-child interaction in the development of adolescents. Some negative interactions, such as bad parenting style, abuse, and aggression, were closely related to the development of depressive symptoms. This study also identified the effect of bullying victimization and the protective effect of a good peer relationship. To some extent, the bad peer interaction suffered by individuals in adolescence is a repetition of the bad parent interaction. These findings suggest that teachers and psychological workers attach importance to parents\u2019 work (e.g., lectures for parents and parent-child psychological group counseling) and the prevention of bullying. More importantly, peer communication training for adolescents is necessary to better help them master the maintenance strategies of high-quality friendship. When individuals have the consciousness and ability to maintain a good friendship, they will also have more strength to cope with the growing pressure and conflicts.\nIn conclusion, this study found different trajectories of depressive symptoms in early adolescence and explored the effects of parental psychological aggression and neglect, parental psychological control, traditional bullying/cyberbullying victimization, and friendship quality. The research combined individual-centered and data-centered methods to complement the results in the related fields. The results help to guide interveners to effectively prevent the occurrence and development of adolescent depression from the perspective\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 09 frontiersin.org\nof family and peer relationships. For example, to decrease adolescent depression, we recommend working with parents, providing mental health education for parents, and calling on parents to interact with their children more healthily. Anti-bullying initiatives should be carried out in schools to prevent bullying.\nHowever, this study has some limitations. First, the followup time was too short, and the waves of data were too few. Future research could take place over a longer time and determine a more accurate development trajectory in Chinese culture. Second, this study did not collect the predictors during the three waves. Therefore, it was difficult to obtain dynamic impact results. Future research could investigate the joint trajectory of parental psychological aggression and neglect, parental psychological control, bullying, friendship quality, and depression, to explore in-depth the dynamic impact mechanism. Thirdly, the data in this study were all self-reported. Social desirability might have introduced bias. In future research, multi-source data could be collected to present the development characteristics and influencing factors more objectively and accurately. Finally, the data were collected only in China and the cross-cultural application of the findings needs further consideration, especially for the predictors."
