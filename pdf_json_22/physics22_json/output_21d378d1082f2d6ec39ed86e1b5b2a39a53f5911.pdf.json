The light-front wave functions of these baryons are given by the eigenstates of the effective Hamiltonian consisting of a three-dimensional confinement potential and a one-gluon exchange interaction with fixed coupling. The masses of these baryons in our approach are in the experimental range, while isospin-dependent mass differences are too small. Meanwhile, the electromagnetic properties are in agreement with the available experimental data, the lattice QCD simulations, and other theoretical calculations. We also present the gluon and the sea quark PDFs, which we generate dynamically from the QCD evolution of the valence quark distributions.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.106.114040\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAlthough quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the wellestablished theory for strong interactions [1], where hadrons are built up from quarks and gluons, due to our incomplete understanding of the color confinement it is not\nyet possible to forecast the experimentally observed hadron spectroscopy from QCD first principles. Meanwhile, a successful theoretical framework for achieving valuable insights into hadron spectra and revealing partonic structures is provided by the Hamiltonian formulation of QCD quantized on the light front [2,3]. Complementary insights into nonperturbative QCD can be accomplished by lightfront holography [4\u20139]. For a practical approach, basis light-front quantization (BLFQ), which is based on the Hamiltonian formalism, provides a computational framework to solve relativistic many-body bound state problems in quantum field theories [10\u201327]. Electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs) and parton dis-\ntribution functions (PDFs) are two essential probes of the internal structure of bound states. Both observables deepen our understanding of nonperturbative and perturbative QCD effects encoded in hadrons. The Fourier transform of the EMFFs provides information about spatial distributions, such as the charge and the magnetization\n*pengtc20@lzu.edu.cn \u2020zhuzhimin@impcas.ac.cn \u2021xsq234@impcas.ac.cn \u00a7xiangliu@lzu.edu.cn \u2225Corresponding author.\nmondal@impcas.ac.cn \u00b6xbzhao@impcas.ac.cn **jvary@iastate.edu\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

While the nucleon\u2019s EMFFs and PDFs have attracted numerous dedicated experimental and theoretical efforts for several decades and are becoming better known (see Ref. [18] and references therein), our information about the partonic structures of the \u039b, \u039bc, and their isospin triplet baryons is very limited. This is due to the short lifetimes of these baryons making them unfeasible as targets. Only the magnetic moments of some of these baryons have been experimentally determined. Meanwhile, the timelike EMFFs of the \u039b baryon have been measured with good precision [28\u201330]. The EMFFs of the \u039b hyperons have been analyzed by several theoretical studies [31\u201341]. The first deep inelastic scattering (DIS) experiment at SLAC [42] showed the partonic substructure of the nucleon. From DIS processes [43], one can extract the PDFs, which encode the nonperturbative structure of the hadrons in terms of the number densities of their confined constituents. The PDFs are functions of the lightfront longitudinal momentum fraction (x) of the hadron carried by the constituents. At the leading twist, the complete spin structure of the spin-1=2 hadrons is described in terms of three independent PDFs, namely, the unpolarized f1\u00f0x\u00de, the helicity g1\u00f0x\u00de, and the transversity h1\u00f0x\u00de. The global fitting collaborations such as HERAPDF [44], NNPDF [45], MMHT [46], CTEQ [47], and MSTW [48] have made considerable efforts to determine nucleon PDFs and their uncertainties. Meanwhile, the nucleon PDFs have also been investigated using different theoretical approaches (see Ref. [18] and references therein). On the other hand, much less information is available on the PDFs of the \u039b, \u039bc, and their isospin triplet baryons [49\u201355], while precise knowledge of PDFs is required for the analysis and interpretation of the scattering experiments in the LHC era. In this paper, with the theoretical framework of BLFQ [10], we adopt an effective light-front Hamiltonian [17,18] and solve for the resulting mass eigenstates for the \u039b, \u039bc, and their isospin triplet baryons at the scales suitable for low-resolution probes. With quarks as the only explicit degrees of freedom, our effective Hamiltonian incorporates a three-dimensional (transverse and longitudinal) confinement potential and the one-gluon exchange (OGE) interaction that account for the dynamical spin effects [13]. By solving this Hamiltonian in the leading Fock space, using the quark masses, the strength of confinement, and the coupling constant as fitting parameters, we determine the masses of the baryons as the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. We also obtain the desired light-front wave functions (LFWFs) of the baryons as the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian. We then employ the LFWFs to study the electromagnetic properties and the PDFs of those\nbaryons. We compare our BLFQ computations for the EMFFs, magnetic moments, and charge radii of the \u039b\u00f0\u03a30;\u03a3\u00fe;\u03a3\u2212\u00de with available experiments and with other theoretical approaches [31\u201335]. The experimental data are not yet available for the electromagnetic properties of the \u039bc\u00f0\u03a3\u00fec ;\u03a3\u00fe\u00fec ;\u03a30c\u00de. We compare our results of the magnetic moments and the charge radii of these baryons with other theoretical calculations reported in Refs. [35,56\u201364]. This paper is organized as follows. A brief description of the BLFQ formalism and the light-front effective Hamiltonian for the baryons is discussed in Sec. II. We discuss the electromagnetic properties of the \u039b, \u039bc, and their isospin triplet baryons in Sec. IV, whereas their PDFs are presented in Sec. V. We provide a brief summary and conclusion in Sec. VI."

At fixed light-front time, the baryonic state can be expressed in terms of various quark (q), antiquark (q\u0304), and gluon (g) Fock components,\njBi \u00bc \u03c8 \u00f03q\u00dejqqqi \u00fe \u03c8 \u00f03q\u00feqq\u0304\u00dejqqqqq\u0304i \u00fe \u03c8 \u00f03q\u00fe1g\u00dejqqqgi \u00fe\u2026; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere the \u03c8 \u00f0\u2026\u00de represent the probability amplitudes to obtain the different parton configurations in the baryon. Within BLFQ, each Fock sector itself consists of an infinite number of basis states. For the purpose of numerical simulations, we employ both a Fock-sector truncation and limits on the basis states within each Fock sector. Here, we restrict ourselves only to the valence Fock component to describe the valence quark contribution to baryon properties. We adopt the effective Hamiltonian (Heff \u00bc P\u00feP\u2212) that incorporates the holographic QCD confinement potential supplemented by the longitudinal confinement, and the OGE interactions [17,18]\n114040-2\nHeff \u00bc X i p\u20d72\u22a5i \u00fem2i xi\n\u00fe 1 2 X i\u2260j \u03ba4 xixj\u00f0r\u20d7\u22a5i \u2212 r\u20d7\u22a5j\u00de2 \u2212 \u2202xi\u00f0xixj\u2202xj\u00de \u00f0mi \u00femj\u00de2\n\u00fe 1 2 X i\u2260j CF4\u03c0\u03b1s Q2ij u\u0304s0i\u00f0k0i\u00de\u03b3\u03bcusi\u00f0ki\u00deu\u0304s0j\u00f0k0j\u00de\u03b3\u03bdusj\u00f0kj\u00deg\u03bc\u03bd;\n\u00f03\u00de\nwhere xi and p\u20d7\u22a5i represent the longitudinal momentum fraction and the relative transverse momentum carried by quark i. mi is the mass of the quark i, and \u03ba determines the strength of the confinement.

We have neglected electromagnetic interactions among the quarks. We have assumed the same strength for our transverse and longitudinal confinement based on the fact that this form reduces to a symmetric three-dimensional harmonic potential in the nonrelativistic limit [13]. It is possible that relaxing this assumption to allow for independent longitudinal and transverse confinement strengths (which therefore introduces another phenomenological parameter) could be advantageous [65,66]. We will pursue this additional freedom in a future work. The basis states of each Fock particle are represented in terms of the transverse and longitudinal coordinates along with the helicity quantum numbers [11]. We exclude the color degree of freedom in the current formalism since, for the pure valence sector considered as a color singlet, a color factor suffices when combined with the strength of our effective OGE interaction. Following BLFQ [10,11], we expand j\u03a8i in terms of the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator (2D-HO) basis state in the transverse direction and the discretized plane-wave basis in the longitudinal direction. The longitudinal momentum of the particle is characterized by the quantum number k. The longitudinal coordinate x\u2212 is confined to a box of length 2Lwith antiperiodic boundary conditions for fermions. The single-quark LFWF in the longitudinal coordinate space is then given by\n\u03c8k\u00f0x\u2212\u00de \u00bc 1\n2L ei \u03c0 Lkx \u2212 ; \u00f04\u00de\nand the longitudinal momentum p\u00fe \u00bc 2\u03c0k=L is discretized, where the dimensionless quantity k \u00bc 1\n2 ; 3 2 ; 5 2 ;\u2026.\nAll many-body basis states are selected to have the fixed total longitudinal momentum P\u00fe \u00bc Pi p\u00fei , where the sum is over the three quarks. We rescale P\u00fe using K \u00bc Pi ki such that P\u00fe \u00bc 2\u03c0L K. For a given quark i, the longitudinal momentum fraction x is then defined as xi \u00bc p\u00fei =P\u00fe \u00bc ki=K. In the transverse direction, we employ the 2D-HO basis state, \u03d5nm\u00f0p\u20d7\u22a5; b\u00de, which is characterized by two quantum numbers n and m representing the radial excitation and the angular momentum projection, respectively, of the Fock particle. In momentum space, the orthonormalized 2D-HO wave functions read [10,11]\n\u03d5n;m\u00f0p\u20d7\u22a5; b\u00de \u00bc ffiffiffi 2 p\nb\u00f02\u03c0\u00de32\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi n! \u00f0n\u00fe jmj\u00de! s e\u2212p\u20d7 2\u22a5=\u00f02b2\u00de\n\u00d7 jp\u20d7\u22a5j b jmj Ljmjn p\u20d72\u22a5 b2 eim\u03b8; \u00f05\u00de\nwith b being its scale parameter with the dimension of mass; L\u03b1n\u00f0x\u00de represent the generalized Laguerre polynomials and \u03b8 \u00bc arg\u00f0p\u20d7\u22a5=b\u00de. For the spin degrees of freedom, the quantum number \u03bb is used to define the helicity of the particle. Thus, each single-particle basis state is associated with four quantum numbers, fx; n;m; \u03bbg. In addition, we have well-defined values of the total angular momentum projection MJ \u00bc P i \u00f0mi \u00fe \u03bbi\u00de for our multibody basis states. Beyond the Fock-space truncation, within each Fock component, further truncation is still required to reduce the basis to a finite dimension. We reduce the infinite basis by introducing a truncation parameter K in the longitudinal direction, and, in the transverse direction, we retain states with the total transverse quantum number\nN\u03b1 \u00bc X i \u00f02ni \u00fe jmij \u00fe 1\u00de; \u00f06\u00de\nsatisfying N\u03b1 \u2264 Nmax, where Nmax is the truncation parameter. The Nmax controls the transverse momentum covered by the 2D-HO basis functions, whereas K is the basis resolution in the longitudinal direction. The Nmax truncation naturally provides ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) regulations. In momentum space, the UV regulator \u039bUV \u2243 b ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi Nmax p , while the IR regulator \u03bbIR \u2243 b= ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi Nmax p . The UV (IR) regulator increases (decreases) with increasing the Nmax [11], and both UV and IR increase as the HO basis scale parameter b increases. We set up our basis using single-particle coordinates. The advantage of using these coordinates is that we can treat each particle in the Fock space on an equal footing [11]. Meanwhile, Heff includes the transverse center-of-mass (c.m.) motion, which is mixed with intrinsic motion. We introduce a constraint term\n114040-3\nH0 \u00bc \u03bbL\u00f0Hc:m: \u2212 2b2I\u00de \u00f07\u00de\ninto the effective Hamiltonian in order to factorize out the transverse c.m. motion from the intrinsic motion. We subtract the zero-point energy 2b2 and multiply a Lagrange multiplier \u03bbL. I denotes the identity operator. The c.m. motion is controlled by [12]\nHc:m: \u00bc X\ni p\u20d7i\u22a5\n2 \u00fe b4 X i xir\u20d7i\u22a5 2 : \u00f08\u00de\nWhen \u03bbL is sufficiently large and positive, we are able to move the excited states of c.m. motion to higher energy than the low-lying spectrum of interest. Thus, the effective Hamiltonian we diagonalize is\nH0eff \u00bc Heff \u2212 X i p\u20d7i\u22a5 2 \u00fe \u03bbL\u00f0Hc:m: \u2212 2b2I\u00de: \u00f09\u00de\nUpon diagonalization of this effective Hamiltonian matrix H0eff within the BLFQ bases, we obtain the eigenvalues that represent the mass spectrum. We also obtain the eigenvectors that correspond to the LFWFs in the BLFQ basis and provide the structural information of the systems. The resulting valence LFWF in momentum space is then expressed as an expansion in the orthonormal basis set consistent with the symmetries of the effective Hamiltonian,\n\u03a8\u039bfxi;p\u20d7i\u22a5;\u03bbig \u00bc hP;\u039bjfxi; p\u20d7i\u22a5; \u03bbigi \u00bc\nX fni;mig \u03c8\u039bfxi;ni;mi;\u03bbig Y i \u03d5ni;mi\u00f0p\u20d7i\u22a5;b\u00de ; \u00f010\u00de\nwith \u03c8\u039bfxi;ni;mi;\u03bbig \u00bc hP;\u039bjfxi; ni; mi; \u03bbigi as the LFWF in BLFQ, where P and \u039b indicate the momentum and the light-front helicity of the system. Note that \u039b and \u03a3 (or \u039bc and \u03a3\u00fec ) are represented as the ground and the first excited states of the effective Hamiltonian and thus the corresponding eigenvectors \u03c8\u039bfxi;ni;mi;\u03bbig, appearing in the LFWF Eq. (10), are also different for \u039b and \u03a3 (or \u039bc and \u03a3\u00fec ). We identify the difference between their wave functions by comparing the S-wave components with their spin-flavor structures dictated by the naive quark model. The spinflavor structures of \u039b and \u03a3 baryons are given in the Appendix."

            "text": "There are four parameters in our model: the quark mass in the kinetic energy (mq=k), the quark mass in the OGE interaction (mq=g), the strength of confining potential (\u03ba \u00bc \u03baT \u00bc \u03baL), and the coupling constant (\u03b1s) in the OGE interaction [17,18]. We now outline our reasoning for flexibility in the choice of the vertex mass. In particular, our model features an effective OGE interaction that\nreflects short distance physics. It approximately describes the processes where valence quarks absorb and emit a gluon during which the system fluctuates between the jqqqi, jqqqgi, and higher Fock components. According to the mass evolution in renormalization group theory, the dynamical OGE would also produce contributions to the quark mass emerging from higher momentum scales leading to a decrease in the quark mass from the gluon dynamics. In turn, this leads to the suggestion that the quark mass in the OGE interaction would be lighter than the kinetic mass. The latter is associated with the long-range physics in our effective Hamiltonian. A similar treatment is also adopted in the literature [67\u201369]. We select the truncation parameters Nmax \u00bc 8 and K \u00bc 16.5, and the model parameters are summarized in Table I. Note that the light quark mass (mq) and the strength of confining potential were fixed by fitting the nucleon mass and the flavor form factors (FFs) [17,18]. In this work, we replace one of the light quark masses by the effective strange (charm) quark mass denoted by ms\u00f0mc\u00de for \u039b\u00f0\u039bc\u00de baryon. We adjust these parameters to fit the known masses of \u039b and \u039bc compiled by the Particle Data Group [70]. Allowing an uncertainty on \u03b1s, we assimilate phenomenologically, in part, the effect of truncations on the system mass (M). Table II compares the computed masses for \u039b\u00f0\u03a30;\u03a3\u00fe;\u03a3\u2212\u00de and \u039bc\u00f0\u03a3\u00fec ;\u03a3\u00fe\u00fec ;\u03a30c) in our BLFQ approach with the experimental data [70]. The errors appearing in our results are estimates based on our assigned 10% uncertainty in the coupling constant \u03b1s. Note that we only fit the masses of \u039b and \u039bc, while the masses of their isospin states are our predictions. We find that the masses of these baryons are in the experimental range, while isospin-dependent mass differences are small as compared to the experimental data. It should be noted that the current calculations subsume the gluon dynamics into effective interactions among the three valence quarks. We cannot directly access the dynamical role of the gluons due to the Fock-space truncation. Future developments will focus on adding higher Fock sectors to include, for example, gluon and sea degrees of freedom, which will eventually allow us to incorporate the fundamental QCD interactions and provide a better prediction for isospin-dependent mass differences. Using those model parameters given in Table I, we then present the EMFFs and the PDFs of those baryons. We also\nTABLE I.

The FFs follow the normalizations Fq1\u00f00\u00de \u00bc nq, with nq being the number of valence quarks of flavor q in the baryon, while the Pauli FFs at Q2 \u00bc 0 provide the anomalous magnetic moments Fq2\u00f00\u00de \u00bc \u03baq. We evaluate the Dirac and Pauli FFs for the valence quarks in the \u039b, \u039bc, and their isospin states using the LFWFs defined in Eq. (10). The flavor Dirac and Pauli FFs for \u039b and its isospin triplet states \u00f0\u03a30;\u03a3\u00fe;\u03a3\u2212\u00de are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. The red bands represent the results for the light quark (u and/or d), while the black bands correspond to the results for the s quark. The error bands in our results are due to our adopted 10% uncertainty in the coupling constant. The slope of the EMFF atQ2 \u2192 0 relates to the electromagnetic radius of the quark. We observe that at small Q2 the slopes of the light quark FFs are larger than those of the s quark FFs. This is due to the lighter mass of the up (down) quark compared to the s quark, and thus the radius of the light quark is also larger than the s quark. Although the flavor content is the same in \u039b and \u03a30, their flavor FFs are not alike, while the flavor FFs of \u03a3\u00fe and \u03a3\u2212 are the same. The Pauli FF for the light quark in \u039b is negative but positive for the s quark, whereas they exhibit opposite behavior in \u03a30. In Fig. 3, we compare our results for the flavor FFs with the lattice QCD simulations [33] available only for the \u03a3\u00fe and \u03a3\u2212. We find that the qualitative behaviors of the flavor FFs obtained within our BLFQ approach and the lattice QCD simulations are approximately consistent with each other. It can be noticed from Figs. 1\u20133 that our model preserves the isospin symmetry. Figures 4 and 5 present the flavor Dirac and Pauli FFs, respectively, for the \u039bc baryon and its isospin states \u00f0\u03a3\u00fec ;\u03a3\u00fe\u00fec ;\u03a30c\u00de. Here again, we observe that the light quark FFs fall much faster than that of the c quark indicating that, as may be expected, the c quark is more localized near the center of the baryons than the light quark. The flavor Dirac FFs of the \u039bc and \u03a3\u00fec are found to be alike, but their flavor Pauli FFs change sign. Meanwhile, both the flavor FFs of \u03a3\u00fe\u00fec are identical to that of \u03a30c. Under charge and isospin symmetry, the baryon FFs can be obtained from the flavor FFs,\n114040-5\nFB 1\u00f02\u00de\u00f0Q2\u00de \u00bc X q eqF q 1\u00f02\u00de; \u00f016\u00de\nwhere the charges of the quarks eu \u00bc 23, ed \u00bc \u2212 13, es \u00bc \u2212 13, and ec \u00bc 23.

Themagneticmoments of the baryons are compared with experimental data in Table III. Based on our BLFQ approach, the magnetic moments for\u039bc and its isospin triplet states are given in Table IV, where we compare our results with other theoretical calculations in Refs. [35,56\u201364]. We find that our predictions for the magnetic moments of \u039bc and \u03a3\u00fec are larger than those in Refs. [35,56\u201364]. This is attributed to the anomalous\nmagnetic moment, i.e., F2\u00f00\u00de, contribution from the charm quark. In our calculations, we find that F2\u00f00\u00de for the charm quark is negative and significantly smaller than the light quarks, while in other theoretical approaches, the magnitude of Fc2\u00f00\u00de is much larger than our result and comparable with their F2\u00f00\u00de of light quarks.

Meanwhile, our predicted value for the magnetic moments of \u03a30c is lower than the values outlined in Refs. [35,56\u201364]. Note that nothing is known about themagnetic moment of\u039bc and its isospin triplet states\nexperimentally at the present time. Our calculation provides a prediction of the expected data for the magnetic moments of heavy baryon from the future experiments. From the Sachs FFs, we can also compute the electromagnetic radii of the baryons (when the charge of the baryon is zero, we need to replace the GBE\u00f00\u00de with one), which are defined by\n114040-9\nhr2EiB \u00bc \u2212 6 GBE\u00f00\u00de dGBE\u00f0Q2\u00de dQ2 Q2\u00bc0 ; \u00f018\u00de\nhr2MiB \u00bc \u2212 6 GBM\u00f00\u00de dGBM\u00f0Q2\u00de dQ2 Q2\u00bc0 : \u00f019\u00de\nThe radii of \u039b\u00f0\u03a30;\u03a3\u00fe;\u03a3\u2212\u00de are presented in Tables V and VI. We compare the BLFQ results with the available theoretical calculations [31,32,35] and the only available measured data for the charge radius of \u03a3\u2212 [72]. We find a reasonable agreement with the experiment within our 10% uncertainties stemming from our uncertainty in \u03b1s. We also find reasonable consistency between our predictions and the results evaluated in the framework of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory [31]. Our predictions for the electromagnetic radii of \u039bc\u00f0\u03a3\u00fec ;\u03a3\u00fe\u00fec ;\u03a30c\u00de are given in Tables VII and VIII. The charge radii are compared with the results evaluated in relativistic quark models [35]. Here we observe substantial differences between our BLFQ predictions and the relativistic quark models [35]. In this connection, we note that there is a rather large spread in the results of the relativistic quark models."

            "text": "The PDF, the probability density that a parton carries a certain fraction of the total light-front longitudinal\nmomentum of a hadron, provides us with information about the nonperturbative structure of hadrons. The quark PDF of the baryon, which encodes the distribution of longitudinal momentum and polarization carried by the quark in the baryon, is defined as\n\u03a6\u0393\u00f0q\u00de\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc 1 2\nZ dz\u2212\n4\u03c0 eip\n\u00fez\u2212=2\n\u00d7 hP;\u039bj\u03c8\u0304q\u00f00\u00de\u0393\u03c8q\u00f0z\u2212\u00dejP;\u039bijz\u00fe\u00bcz\u20d7\u22a5\u00bc0: \u00f020\u00de For different Dirac structures, one obtains different quark PDFs of the baryon. For example, for \u0393 \u00bc \u03b3\u00fe; \u03b3\u00fe\u03b35, and i\u03c3j\u00fe\u03b35, one has the unpolarized PDF f\u00f0x\u00de, helicity distribution g1\u00f0x\u00de, and transversity distribution h1\u00f0x\u00de, respectively. It is worth noting that we work in the light-front gauge A\u00fe \u00bc 0 so that the gauge link appearing in between the quark fields in Eq. (20) is unity. Here, we compute the quark unpolarized PDFs from the eigenstates of our light-front effective Hamiltonian (3) in the constituent valence quarks representation suitable for low-momentum scale applications. Following the two-point quark correlation function defined in Eq. (20), in the LFWFs overlap representation, the unpolarized PDFs f\u00f0x\u00de in the valence Fock component at the initial scale (\u03bc0) reads fq\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc X \u03bbi Z \u00bddXdP\u22a5 \u03a8\u2191 fxi;p\u20d7i\u22a5;\u03bbig\u03a8 \u2191 fxi;p\u20d7i\u22a5;\u03bbig\u03b4\u00f0x \u2212 xq\u00de: \u00f021\u00de Using the LFWFs within the BLFQ approach given in Eq. (10), we evaluate the unpolarized PDFs for the valence quarks in the baryon, which are normalized asZ\n1\n0\ndx fq\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc Fq1\u00f00\u00de \u00bc nq; \u00f022\u00de\nwith nq being the number of quarks of flavor q in the baryon. Furthermore, at the model scale, the following momentum sum rule is satisfied by our PDFs:\nX q\nZ 1\n0\ndx xfq\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc 1: \u00f023\u00de\n114040-11\nBy performing the QCD evolution, we obtain the valence quark PDFs at higher \u03bc2 scales using input PDFs at the model scale. We interpret the model scale associated with our LFWFs as the effective scale where the structures of the baryon are described by the motion of the valence quarks only. The scale evolution allows the valence quarks to produce gluons, with the emitted gluons capable of producing quark-antiquark pairs as well as additional gluons. In this picture, the gluon and sea quark components emerge at scales higher than the model scale. The QCD evolution is described by the well-known Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) equations [74\u201376]. Here, we utilize the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) DGLAP equations of QCD to evolve our valence quark distributions from our model scale \u03bc20 to higher scale \u03bc2. For this purpose, we employ the Higher Order Perturbative Parton Evolution toolkit to numerically solve the NNLO DGLAP equations [77]. We adopt \u03bc20 \u00bc 0.45 0.04 GeV2 for the initial scale of our PDFs for \u039b\u00f0\u03a30;\u03a3\u00fe;\u03a3\u2212\u00de, which we determine by matching the moment of the valence quark PDFs for \u039b: hxiq \u00bcR 1 0 dx xf q 1\u00f0x\u00de at \u03bc2 \u00bc 4 GeV2, with the result from the lattice QCD simulations hxiu \u00bc hxid \u00bc 0.20 0.01 and hxis \u00bc 0.27 0.01 [49], after performing the QCD evolution of our initial quark PDFs. Meanwhile, we choose the initial scale for the PDFs of\u039bc\u00f0\u03a3\u00fec ;\u03a3\u00fe\u00fec ;\u03a30c\u00de as the hadronic scale \u03bc20 \u00bc 1.0 0.1 GeV2. Figure 10 shows our results for the valence quark unpolarized PDFs of the \u039b and its isospin triplet states at the model scale computed using the LFWFs given in\nEq. (10). The red bands correspond to the results for the light quark (u and/or d), whereas the blue bands represent the results for the strange quark. The bands shown in our results arise from the 10% uncertainties in the coupling constant \u03b1s. Since ms > mu\u00f0d\u00de, the peak of the strange quark distribution in the baryons appears at a higher x compared to the light quark distribution. Therefore, the strange quark carries larger longitudinal momentum than the light quark, reducing the probability of finding a light quark with high x in the baryons. We notice that the valence quark distributions in \u03a3\u00fe and \u03a3\u2212 are nearly identical due to isospin symmetry in the model. However, the magnitude of light quark PDFs in these baryons is larger than that of the strange quark PDF. This is because there are two up (down) quarks in \u03a3\u00fe\u00f0\u03a3\u2212\u00de. Meanwhile, the magnitude of the single light quark distribution is lower compared to that for the strange quark in \u039b and \u03a30. The valence quark PDFs of the \u039bc\u00f0\u03a3\u00fec ;\u03a3\u00fe\u00fec ;\u03a30c\u00de at the initial scale are shown in Fig. 11. The peaks of the light quark PDFs again appear at lower x, whereas due to the heavier mass, the charm quark distributions have peaks at higher x. The PDFs of the \u039bc and \u03a3\u00fe\u00fec are identical to the distributions of \u03a3\u00fec and \u03a30c, respectively. Note that \u03a3\u00fe\u00fec \u00f0\u03a30c\u00de has two light quarks of the same flavor, which effectively provides the light quark PDF in \u03a3\u00fe\u00fec \u00f0\u03a30c\u00de twice that of the light quark PDF in \u039bc\u00f0\u03a3\u00fec \u00de. Figures 10 and 11 suggest that our model maintains the isospin symmetry, which is also observed from FFs in Figs. 1\u20133. We demonstrate the scale evolution of the PDFs of \u039b\u00f0\u03a30;\u03a3\u00fe;\u03a3\u2212\u00de and \u039bc\u00f0\u03a3\u00fec ;\u03a3\u00fe\u00fec ;\u03a30c\u00de from the initial scales to 10 GeV2 in Figs. 12 and 13, respectively. We observe\n114040-12\nthat, for \u039b, \u039bc, and their isospin states, the valence quark distributions increase slowly at lower x, while they decrease at higher x with the scale evolution. The gluon and the sea quark PDFs at low x increase much faster than the valence quark PDFs. Effectively, in the low-x region, the distributions are mainly dominated by the gluon PDFs, while at large x the valence quarks dominate the distributions. We notice that the qualitative behavior of the gluon and the sea\nquarks PDFs obtained by the evolution in both \u039b, \u039bc, and their isospin states are very similar. Since the masses of the charm and light quarks in \u039bc\u00f0\u03a3\u00fec ;\u03a3\u00fe\u00fec ;\u03a30c\u00de are very different, the peaks of their distributions appear at different x. The valence quark PDFs in these states exhibit distinctly different behavior compared to that in \u039b\u00f0\u03a30;\u03a3\u00fe;\u03a3\u2212\u00de, where the valence quark (light and strange) PDFs are close to each other after QCD evolution.\n114040-13\nThe first moments of the corresponding PDFs of \u039b, \u039bc, and their isospin states as functions of scale \u03bc are shown in Figs. 14 and 15. We notice that the uncertainty bands in Fig. 15 are insignificant. This is due to the small \u03b1s for \u039bc (\u03a3c), and thus our adopted 10% uncertainty in \u03b1s is also small. We find that with increasing scale \u03bc, as for the other cases described above, momenta carried by the valence quarks decrease, and the contributions of the sea quarks and gluon to the total momentum increase. For the light\nbaryons, the momentum carried by the valence quarks falls faster with increasing scale than that for the baryons having a charm quark. However, the qualitative behaviors of the total moments of valence quarks, sea quarks, and gluons in all states are alike. Note that the x PDFs at low x behave like xa, where a > 0 for the valence quarks, whereas for the gluon and the sea quarks a > \u22121 [25]. The value of the exponent a decreases with increasing scale \u03bc. When \u03bc \u2192 \u221e, a \u2192 0 for\n114040-14\nthe valence quarks, and for the gluon and the sea quarks, a \u2192 \u22121. This phenomenon does not depend on the PDFs at the model scale. To illustrate the low-x behavior of the sea quarks and the gluon PDFs with increasing scales, we consider x PDFs of the baryons at low x, xf\u00f0x\u00de \u223c xa, and present the behavior of a as a function of \u03bc in Fig. 16. We observe that a falls steadily and faster for the gluon than that for the sea quarks with increasing \u03bc. This feature again\nindicates that at low x the gluon dominates the distribution as the scale increases."

            "text": "Using a recently proposed light-front model for the baryon based on a Hamiltonian formalism, we presented a comprehensive study of the masses, electromagnetic\n114040-15\nproperties, and PDFs of \u039b, \u039bc, and their isospin triplet states. The effective Hamiltonian incorporates confinement in both the transverse and longitudinal directions and onegluon exchange interaction for the constituent valence quarks suitable for low-resolution properties. We obtained the masses of baryons and the corresponding LFWFs as the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of this Hamiltonian, respectively, by solving its mass eigenvalue equation using BLFQ as a relativistic three-quark problem. We then employed the LFWFs to investigate the baryon electromagnetic properties and PDFs. We evaluated the electromagnetic form factors for the baryons and their flavor decompositions, the magnetic moments, electric radii, and magnetic radii of the baryons. We compared our BLFQ results with other theoretical calculations [31\u201335,56\u201364] and experimental data [70,72] and found reasonable agreement with available measured data, lattice QCD simulation [33], constituent quark model [34], and heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory [31]. We also computed the unpolarized PDFs of these baryons at a low-resolution scale using our LFWFs. The PDFs at higher scales relevant to experiment and to global QCD analyses have been evaluated based on the NNLO DGLAP equations. The QCD evolution of the PDFs, which gives us the knowledge of the gluon and the sea quark distributions, has also been explored. We observed that, although the valence quark dominates at the large x > 0.1 domain, at the small-x region the distributions are mainly controlled by the gluon distribution. The momenta carried by the gluon and sea quark increase with increasing scale \u03bc. We also noticed that there is an impression of universality of the gluon PDFs from different baryon states. Overall, the QCD evolution of the valence quark PDFs provides predictions for a wealth of information on the gluon and the sea quarks arising from higher Fock components. For further improvement, future developments should focus on the inclusion of higher Fock sectors directly in the Hamiltonian eigenvalue problem in order to explicitly incorporate gluon and sea degrees of freedom at appropriate initial scales. Our work provides predictions for PDFs of the baryons having one strange or charm quark \u039b\u00f0\u03a30;\u03a3\u00fe;\u03a3\u2212\u00de and \u039bc\u00f0\u03a3\u00fec ;\u03a3\u00fe\u00fec ;\u03a30c\u00de from future experiments, as well as a guidance for the theoretical studies of the PDFs with higher Fock sectors.\nSince our LFWFs incorporate all three active quarks\u2019 spin, flavor, and three-dimensional spatial information on the same footing, the effective LFWFs can be employed to investigate other parton distributions, such as the helicity and transversity PDFs, generalized parton distributions, transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions, Wigner distributions, and double parton distribution functions, as well as mechanical properties of the baryons. The presented results affirm the utility of our model and motivate application of analogous effective Hamiltonians to other heavy baryons."
