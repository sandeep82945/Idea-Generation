The conclusions and recommendations outlined in this dissertation underscore the effectiveness and versatility of Bayesian learning approaches in analyzing natural gas flaring data. The suite of models developed provides a comprehensive framework for extracting insights from flaring data at various levels and from different perspectives, emphasizing the importance of incorporating domain expertise, ensuring model interpretability, quantifying uncertainty, and mitigating overfitting. The recommendations for future work suggest exploring hierarchical Gaussian processes for pooling information across entities, investigating the efficacy of spatial-temporal models to understand the influence of neighboring entities on flaring behaviors, and employing nonparametric methods like Dirichlet process for automatic cluster determination in Gaussian mixture models. These directions promise to further enhance the understanding and management of gas flaring, contributing to more informed decision-making and policy development in the petroleum industry.
