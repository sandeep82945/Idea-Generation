For this purpose, a wide field of game mechanics is already available that can be used in teaching. For the development of gamified teaching methods, it\u2019s important to adapt the mechanics used to the students. There are different models that divide target groups of games and gamification into player types to understand what motivates the respective users. This paper describes a study of player types among students of health-related disciplines and analyses the data by a K-Means clustering procedure. The player types Socializer, Player and Achiever are found, and game elements for this groups are suggested. Thus, in the field of health education, game mechanics can be used, which are suitable for students of this domain.",

            "text": "During their studies, students are often confronted with the challenge of acquiring extensive knowledge in a short period of time. Miller's pyramid describes four levels of competence learning. To reach the top level \"Does\" of competence, the lowest level \"Knows\" must be fulfilled first [1].\nFor example, in medical studies, extensive factual knowledge is therefore already required in the first semesters. The M1 exam includes 320 questions on medical factual knowledge and is administered after the 4th semester [2]. However, the way in which this basic knowledge is taught at universities is ineffective for storing the knowledge in the brain. According to Dale's cone of experience, learners can only remember 50% of the information that is conveyed visually and auditorily in a lecture [3].\nAs a result, lecture content should either be conveyed by other means or repeated by the students. From a motivational and learning psychology point of view, gamification can be used for this purpose. Gamification has many positive effects, such as increased motivation, engagement, and well-being of users [4\u20136]. For this purpose, a wide field of game mechanics is already available that can be used in teaching [7, 8].\nDespite the already prevalent use of gamification in teaching, there is a lack of scientific methodology in the development of gamified teaching methods, as well as the evaluation of them [5]. For the development of gamified teaching methods, it\u2019s important to adapt the mechanics used to the students [5]. There are different models that divide\n1 Corresponding Author: Lea Brandl, Institute of Telematics, University of L\u00fcbeck, Ratzeburger Allee\n160, 23562 L\u00fcbeck, Germany, Mail: lea.brandl@uni-luebeck.de\ntarget groups of games and gamification into player types to understand what motivates the respective users [9\u201311].\nThis paper describes a study of player types among students of health-related disciplines, and proposes a new method for evaluating them. Here, the goal is to identify the player types among the students, considering not only the strongest player type, but all player types of their personalities."

[12] use an audience response system to test students, playfully. Unfortunately, the player types are often ignored.\nBartle's model is among the widely used models of player types. It defines four\ndifferent player types based on two dimensions. The first dimension deals with the relevance of the environment of the game or being surrounded by players. The second dimension extends from the preference of acting to that of reacting [9]. Critical to the model is that players in games must satisfy multiple properties of different types. Although it is often used, a player cannot be assigned exclusively to one type, but has characteristics of different types. Furthermore, the model is not based on sociologically collected data, but only on experiences and reports of players of the genre Multiuser Dungeon [8, 9]."

The framework describes six different types, of which four (1 to 4) are intrinsically motivated, one (5) is extrinsically motivated, and one (6) is neither extrinsically nor intrinsically motivated [8, 11]:\n1. Socializer: This type of player wants to interact with other players. They are\ninterested in parts of the system that allow them to connect with other participants. 2. Free spirit: They do not want to be restricted in exploring the system or creating\nnew things within the system. For them freedom of choice is very important.\n3. Achievers: They want to use and master the system 100%. This is about\nimproving themselves.\n4. Philanthropist: This type is motivated by the feeling of being part of something\nbigger. Without expecting anything in return, they want to give to other players. 5. Player: This is the only extrinsic player type. These players are looking for\nrewards or quid pro quos from other players.\n6. Disruptor: This type is neither extrinsically nor intrinsically motivated for the\nsystem. He is motivated by disrupting the system or fellow players."

Subjects in the study were asked to sort a total of 49 statements regarding preferred game mechanics by providing information on whether\nthey agreed, disagreed, or were neutral towards them. Five genre independent player types were identified [10]:\n1. Social achiever: This player type prefers collaborative achievement of goals and\nsuccesses in a game.\n2. Explorer: Players of this player type favor exploring and changing a game world\non their own.\n3. Competitor: These players attach great importance to winning in a game. They\nlook for competition with other players, but also with computer-controlled opponents. 4. Socializer: They use the activity of gaming to meet and exchange ideas with\nother players.\n5. Troll: This type of players compensates their own lack of interest in a game by\nusing cheats, exploiting bugs in the game to their own advantage, and annoying or harassing other players. Among the 109 participants, 30 were assigned to a type. 12 Social Achievers, seven\nExplorers, four Competitors, five Socializers and two Trolls were identified [10]."

The questionnaire includes 24 items, which are answered on a 7-point Likert scale. Each player type is assigned four items [8]. This was\ntranslated into German and validated by Krath and von Korflesch [7]. Compared to the instrument used by Gaalen et al., it can be completed in a shorter time. In addition, a simple evaluation of all expressions is possible. For the evaluation of the measuring instrument, the items of the respective characteristics are added up [8]. It is suggested to assign the player type whose proficiency is the highest. Since the proficiencies of other player types among the respondents are not considered, the data in this paper were evaluated using a cluster procedure that takes all proficiencies into account. To ensure the comparability of the data sets and to consider only the proficiency of the player types, the data were standardized before the cluster procedure. Three cluster procedures were compared using the Calinski-Harabasz [15] and Davies-Bouldin scores [16]. The unsupervised clustering algorithms K-Means, Meanshift, and agglomerative hierarchical clustering (Euclidean distance, ward linkage) were compared to analyze the data. In addition, preprocessing by PCA for K-Means was analyzed. The number of clusters was evaluated using the Silhouette score as well as the Elbow plot or a histogram. The clustering and the analyses were realized with python (v. 3.10).\nThe Hexad framework was used to assign individual game mechanics to the\nidentified clusters."

The low expression of the player type Disruptor and the strong expression of the Socializer and the Philanthropist is noteworthy. The other types are on average less strong to neutral in their expression, see figure 1 (left).\nThe second cluster consists of 52 subjects. In contrast to the first cluster, the Socializer player type is weak to neutral, as is the Disruptor type. In comparison, the Achiever and the Player types are remarkably strong, see figure 1 (right).\nThe last cluster comprises 44 subjects.

Socializers, and Achievers, on the other hand, should receive more attention. Due to the high level of the Player in cluster 2, it should be considered to include elements for this type. Also, elements to support the Philanthropist and Free Spirit types can also be incorporated. Based on Tondello et al. [8] and Karth and von Korflesch [7], the use of challenges or quests that are to be solved together is particularly suitable for Achievers and Socializers. For example, teams that compete against each other. For Players,\nrewarding elements such as points, or achievements represent an opportunity. Easter Eggs for Free Spirits and administrative roles for Philanthropists can be integrated also."

[12] the mechanics used match partly not the player types evaluated in this work and other mechanics could further amplify the measured effects. Compared to the results of Gaalen et al. no clear differences can be seen, if only the most expressed player types are considered. But this paper extends previous evaluations by clustering them to account for all characteristics of player types. Based on this, it shows which mechanics are most suitable for students in the healthcare sector.\nThe sample size is significant for the population studied and a silhouette score of\n0.44 could be obtained, showing a weak cluster strength. The clustering procedure could probably be further improved by a larger sample and stronger clusters could be achieved. Also, bootstrap methods could be used to compensate for uncertainties regarding cluster properties. Since only students from the University of L\u00fcbeck were surveyed, the study should be repeated with the inclusion of additional institutions.\nFurthermore, it should be noted that in a survey with voluntary participation, a self-\nselection bias can be assumed, which may have had an influence on the characteristics of the player types.\nDeclarations Conflicts of Interest: None declared.\nContributions of the authors: LB, AS: conception of the study, LB: conduct of the study, data collection, data analysis and interpretation; LB: writing of the manuscript, AS substantial revision of the manuscript.
