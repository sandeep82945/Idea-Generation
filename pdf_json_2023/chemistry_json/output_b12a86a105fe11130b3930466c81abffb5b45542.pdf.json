The authors have therefore performed additional calculations with correlation consistent basis sets, following previous work.1 The results that have been obtained using a cc-pVTZ basis set are summarised in Table 1. Compared to the parameterisation in the original article, the two main differences are the overall excitation energy (from 4.04 eV to 4.44 eV) and the qualitative changes in the y and z components of the electric dipole transition moment. Since the circular dichroism is, to first order, given by the overlap between magnetic and electric dipole transition moments, these changes cause qualitative differences to the behaviour of the system upon irradiation."

In a real system, different geometries beyond the minimum of the electronic ground state potential energy surface contribute to the absorption even for the vibrational ground state. The corresponding nuclear displacements can be seen as perturbations to the equilibrium system, mixing its eigenstates, which leads to an intensity borrowing mechanism.3,4 Particularly for the n - p* transition in carbonyl groups, these vibrational structure effects are known to be important.4\u20136 This transition is very weak and thus the impact of mixing with electric dipole allowed transitions is comparatively large. As a result, the neglection of vibrational structure is a limitation of the model that the authors aim to address in a future study.\nThe functional used in the original manuscript, eqn (11), was designed to maximise the absolute difference in population,\nJoldT \u00bc 1 1 2 C1 CR\u00f0T\u00dej 2\u00fe C0 CS T\u00f0 \u00dej 2 \u00bc 1 2 1 Dn\u00f0 \u00de: (1)\nAfter amending these issues in the original manuscript, the authors have observed that the optimisation functional in the original article did not lead to an increase in the anisotropy factor anymore. After changing the optimisation target to the anisotropy itself, the optimisations were successful in increasing its value, but this came at the cost of a very small absolute population difference, which would lead to a vanishing signal in the experiment. Therefore, instead of directly optimising the anisotropy g, the weighting\nTable 1 Energies, permanent electric dipole and transition multipole moments for the ground and first electronic excited state of fenchone obtained at CCSD/cc-pVTZ level with DALTON2020.0\n|0i |1i\nEnergy (eV) El. dip.

These ideas lead to defining the following new optimisation functional,\nJnewT = 2 |Dn|ag. (2)\nThe authors have chosen the particular form of eqn (2) such that the new functional strikes a balance between the optimisation of the relative population difference encoded by g and the absolute population difference encoded by |Dn|. Larger values of a favour the absolute signal strength |Dn|, smaller values of a favour the anisotropy g. The authors have repeated the optimisations with different values of a and found the above value a C 0.075 to provide a good compromise. It is large enough to obtain solutions that provide appreciable signal strength, but small enough that the anisotropy still represents the primary optimisation goal. The authors have also confirmed that the qualitative nature of the results does not sensitively depend on the precise value of a chosen for the optimisation \u2013 for example, in the additional calculations, very similar optimisation results for values a A [0.06,0.09] have been obtained.\nWith this new functional, the relation between the fidelity and the difference in excited-state population between R and S enantiomers (eqn (17) in the original article) is less direct. Therefore, for the purpose of Fig. 3 and 4, the population difference, Dn, has been directly plotted. This facilitates distinguishing whether a given pulse favours absorption in the R enantiomer (to which positive values of Dn are assigned) or the S enantiomer (negative values of Dn).\nTable 2 Parameters of the circularly polarised guess pulse (anisotropy g = 0.69 after orientational averaging) and the optimised pulse (anisotropy g = 0.86 after orientational averaging)\nOptimised pulse Guess pulse\nE(0) (GV m 1) E(1) (GV m 1) E(2) (GV m 1) o(1) (eV) o(2) (eV) j E(0) (GV m 1) E(1) (GV m 1) E(2) (GV m 1) o(1) (eV) o(2) (eV) j\nEx 25.71 24.91 25.71 4.22 2.11 1.53 0.0 25.71 0.0 4.44 \u2014 1.57 Ey 0.0 25.39 5.92 4.22 2.11 0.0 25.71 0.0 4.44 \u2014\nFig. 2 Comparison of optimisations with a fully parametrised pulse (top), a restricted pulse without DC contribution (middle) and a restricted pulse without o(2) contribution (bottom).

With the new ab initio data and corrected code, an improvement of about 20% in the g factor (from g = 0.69 to g = 0.86) has been obtained using the new functional in eqn (2), although this comes at the cost of a reduced absolute absorption. The parameters of the optimised pulse are given in Table 2. The increase obtained is appreciably lower compared to the results from the original publication (from g = 0.06 to g E 1). Nonetheless, the model still predicts that it is possible to increase the anisotropy factor of fenchone using optimal control.\nThe population difference between the excited states of the R and S enantiomers irradiated with pulses optimised for each particular orientation is shown in Fig. 3.

This behaviour was similarly seen in Fig. 4 of the original article.\nFig. 4 shows the excited-state population difference between enantiomers when all orientations are irradiated with the optimised pulse shown in Fig. 1. Although the shape of the light-coloured areas indicating high chiral distinguishability is different from the previous results, cf. Fig. 5 of the original article, the crucial feature is preserved \u2013 the light-coloured areas are found predominantly in the panels close to b = p/2. This shows that the optimisation algorithm still focuses on increasing the population difference for those orientations that have a greater weight in the ensemble, as discussed in the original article.\nThe new simulations also confirm the importance of the DC contribution for the optimisation pulse. Analogously to the original article, this has been conformed by performing different pulse optimisations on the orientationally averaged system when considering different constraints to the pulse during the optimisation, namely: (i) forcing a null DC contribution to the field and (ii) forcing a null o(2) contribution to the field. The resulting excited-state population dynamics are shown in the middle (case (i)) and bottom panels (case (ii)) of Fig. 2, which corresponds to Fig. 3 in the original manuscript. In both old and new simulations, it is clear that the algorithm is not able to find a suitable pulse without a DC contribution, and that the electric quadrupole (coupling to the field predominantly with frequency o(2)) only has a minor effect on the overall optimisation.\nThe Royal Society of Chemistry apologises for these errors and any consequent inconvenience to authors and readers."
