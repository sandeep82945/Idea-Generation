    "abstractText": "Monitoring interferences to satellite-based navigation systems is of paramount importance in order to reliably operate critical infrastructures, navigation systems, and a variety of applications relying on satellite-based positioning. This paper investigates the use of crowdsourced data to achieve such detection and monitoring at a central node that receives the data from an arbitrary number of agents in an area of interest. Under ideal conditions, the pathloss model is used to compute the Cram\u00e9r-Rao Bound of accuracy as well as the corresponding maximum likelihood estimator. However, in real scenarios where obstructions and reflections are common, the signal propagation is far more complex than the pathloss model can explain. We propose to augment the pathloss model with a data-driven component, able to explain the complexities of the propagation channel. The paper shows a general methodology to jointly estimate the interference location and the parameters of the augmented model, showing superior performances in complex scenarios such as those encountered in urban environments.",

            "text": "GNSS is a general term that encompasses satellite-based navigation systems such as GPS, Galileo, Glonass and Beidou among others [1,2]. It relies on a constellation of satellites synchronously emitting known signals, which enable computation of a receiver position, velocity, and time (PVT) unknowns. GNSS is arguably the primary technology when it comes to position, navigation, and timing (PNT) applications, such as intelligent transportation systems [3\u20135], critical infrastructures [6], environmental applications [7], or agriculture applications [8] to name a few. However, the increasing dependence on GNSS has created a concern about its potential vulnerabilities [9], mostly related to GNSS vulnerability to simple jamming interferences [10, 11] or more complex spoofing attacks [12].\nIt is therefore of crucial importance to develop interference monitoring systems that can detect and localize the possible threats in an area [13, 14]. In this paper we are particularly interested in congested areas, where malicious users are more prone to operate, where crowdsourced [15] data can be leveraged in order to implement such monitoring. In particular, we foresee a system where agents navigate an area with capabilities of transmitting the measured signal power at the corresponding GNSS frequency bands. Recall that GNSS signals are transmitted using a spread-spectrum system such that they are below the receiver\u2019s noise floor, as a consequence signal values with powers larger than the noise floor would likely correspond to\nThis work has been partially supported by the NSF under Award ECCS1845833.\na jamming signal being present in the vicinity. If a large number of agents convey this information to a central unit, the data can be processed in order to localize the source of jamming interferences and, ultimately, take corrective measures. Several challenges of this approach are addressed in this paper, namely the need for an accurate signal propagation model from which one can perform inference from. The nominal pathloss model has severe disadvantages when it comes to complex environments, given that accounting for reflections and obstructions is not simple. To overcome this, we propose to augment the pathloss model with a data-driven component (e.g. a neural network, or NN for short) that is able to learn the position dependent parts of the propagation model that are complex to accurately model. We refer to these models as augmented physicsbased models (APBMs), which were succesfully used in other contexts [16\u201318].\nSection 2 presents the jammer localization problem, discussing the nominal pathloss signal propagation model that is used as a measurement equation in the proposed scheme. Under the nominal model, the Crame\u0301r-Rao bound (CRB) of estimation accuracy is derived as well as the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). The proposed APBM augmentation to the pathloss is discussed in Section 3, where it is shown how we propose to jointly estimate the jammer\u2019s location and the parameters of the augmented model. Experiments are provided in Section 4 for i) an open-sky scenario where the pathloss is an accurate model, which is used to validate the proposed methods; and ii) a more complex urban scenario, where the received signal powers are generated using ray tracing techniques, where the APBM shows its superiority to plain pathloss modeling. Finally, Section 5 discusses the main conclusions and outlook of this work."

For this, let us define X = {x1, . . . ,xN} and D = {yn,xn}Nn=1 as a dataset composed of N i.i.d. pairs of loci xn and RSS measurements yn. Assuming (6) to define the statistical characteristics of the model in (1), the likelihood distribution can be written as:\np(y|X,\u03b8) = N\u220f n=1 p(yn|xn,\u03b8)\n= 1\n(2\u03c0\u03c32)N/2 exp\n{ \u2212 1\n2\u03c32 N\u2211 n=1\n(yn \u2212 f(xn;\u03b8))2 } .

This generate singularities in the likelihood function that need to be addressed when solving the optimization in (23).

The effect of this choice is twofold. First, infinite values are removed from the observation function and singularities are avoided. Secondly, the \u201choles\u201d visible in Figure 1 (left panel) are filled before the gradient becomes too steep, towards the singularity points. In this way the maximization of the log-likelihood can be pursued efficiently through gradient-based methods. The resulting log-likelihood is shown in Figure 1 (right panel). This strategy is also effective when minimizing the cost function described next."

            "text": "Although the pathloss model in (1) is well suited to describe the jamming RSS field over open-spaces, it fails to capture the complexity of urban or indoor scenarios where multiple reflections and attenuations might occur. Additionally, our practical experience indicated that naive, in the sense that no prior information regarding the jamming field is incorporated in the model, NNs can only represent the jamming field accurately enough if humongous amounts of data is readily available. For this reason, in this section we propose an augmented physics-based (i.e., pathloss-based) neural network model where the NN acts as a nonlinear correction term around the pathloss function. Recently, APBMs have been used successfully in different scenarios [16\u201318, 25]. Here, we propose to augment the modified pathloss model with NNs leading to an enhanced model:\nh(xn;\u03b8,\u03c6) = f\u0304(xn;\u03b8) + g(xn;\u03c6) (25)\nwhere \u03c6 \u2208 RM is the vector of neural network\u2019s parameters. The measurement model in (1) can then be re-written as\nyn = h(xn;\u03b8,\u03c6) + \u03ben , (26)\nand used to perform inference as described later in this section. To limit the NN from overpowering the physics-based model, the authors in [17,18] considered different regularizations employed to force the NN to act as a correction term around the physics-based model, maintaining interpretability of the overall model. Similarly, we consider a `2 regularization to control the NN contribution. Thus, we define the regularized cost function as\nC(D,\u03b8,\u03c6) = N\u2211 n=1 \u2016yn \u2212 h(xn;\u03b8,\u03c6)\u201622 + \u03b2\u2016\u03c6\u201622 (27)\nwhere \u03b2 \u2208 R+ is a scalar controlling the regularization over the NN\u2019s parameters, such that when \u03b2 = 0 the NN dominates the\nAPBM and when \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e the NN contribution is reduced. Finally, we define the optimization problem with respect to the jammer location \u03b8 and the NN\u2019s parameters \u03c6 as a empirical risk minimization problem as:\n(\u03b8\u0302, \u03c6\u0302) = arg min \u03b8,\u03c6\nEp\u0302(D) { C(D,\u03b8,\u03c6) } (28)\nwhere the expectation operator is taken with respect to the empirical data distribution p\u0302(D)."

            "text": "In this section we present our experimental results in two simulated scenarios: an ideal scenario, where the jamming signal propagates according to a nominal pathloss (PL) model, defined by \u03b3 = 2 and described by (2); and an urban scenario, subject to intense multipath and shadowing effects. The urban scenario is modeled exploiting a ray tracing approach [26,27], computing multiple propagation paths using 3-D environment geometry and electromagnetic analysis, including free-space loss and reflection losses up to 4 reflections.\nParticularly, we compare the localization performance of (i) the MLE in (23) under the PL model assumption; (ii) the proposed APBM (\u03b2 = 1) implemented as in (28); (iii) the APBM (\u03b2 = 1) where the parameter P0 is also estimated jointly along \u03b8 and \u03c6, which is of practical importance; (iv) a PL-only solution for (28) where h(xn;\u03b8,\u03c6) = f\u0304(xn;\u03b8); and (v) a NN-only solution for\n(28) where h(xn;\u03b8,\u03c6) = g(xn;\u03c6). Additionally, we plot the CRB (under the PL model) for the sake of benchmarking.\nBoth scenarios involve a static jammer, transmitting with P0 = 10 dB. We collected 10000 observations over an area of 1 km2, yielding, on average, 1 observation every 10 \u00d7 10 m square. Since the signal power decreases very fast with respect to the distance from the source, weak power observations are not informative and buried in the noise floor. Only the 15 most powerful observations were fed to the estimators. We repeated the data collection for different measurement noise variance and therefore different interferenceto-noise ratio (INR), defined as INR = 10 log10 P0/\u03c3\n2 . For each INR level, NMC = 100 Monte Carlo realizations were simulated to collect statistics about the estimators performances. To compare the different approaches we consider the root-mean-square error (RMSE) computed over each dimension of \u03b8 as\nRMSE\u03b8i = \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a 1 NMC NMC\u2211 n=1 (\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8\u0302i,n)2 (29)\nThe NN model is a feed-forward network with 2 hidden layers of 200 and 100 neurons and a hyperbolic tangent activation function. The PL model in (ii) and (iv) is initialized with the same information available to the MLE, i.e. P0 and \u03b3. The models are trained over 200 epochs with a learning rate of 0.4, exploiting the Adam optimizer [28] and batch learning.\nIn the PL scenario, addressed in Figure 4, the jamming signal propagates in nominal conditions, according to (2), and (i) and (iv) are based on a model that matches exactly this propagation rule. Not surprisingly, as the INR increases, they are all approaching the CRB, which is also based on perfect modeling. The use of the PL model component alone enables to closely follow the MLE, even at low INR values, where the fixed implementation settings might prevent such method to perform at its best. Indeed, it is worth stressing that the common settings described at the beginning of this section are kept constant for all the scenarios and methods. Moreover, the solution adopted to circumvent the pathloss formula singularities (see Section 2.3) might affect the learning process in a systematic way for a given set of measurements and jammer locations. On the contrary, despite the simple propagation rule, the NN-only solution is unable to effectively learn the model and it is not able to improve further above 20 dB of INR. When the separate components are joined again to realize the APBM we observe a low RMSE, very close to the MLE, also around 10 dB where the complete system (ii) is outperforming the PL-only model (iv). In these conditions, the NN component is probably helping the APBM to overcome the learning flaws of the PL model. Conversely at very low INR the high amount of measurement noise has a counter-productive effect on the joint learning. The APBM can also work being P0-blind (iii), with no knowledge about the jammer\u2019s power and indeed converge to a correct estimation (Figure 4). In this case the NN is effectively able to learn a constant term, which compensate for the missing jammer information, providing a fundamental aid. The low RMSE values attained by the MLE and PL model in Figure 4 are possible thanks to a perfect knowledge of the propagation environment. When it comes to a realistic scenario such as the one in Figure 3, few valid assumptions on the pathloss can be made. This results in the jammer location estimation performances shown in Figure 5. The MLE and PL-only solution are far form the attainable minimum, instead the APBM and NN-only model are performing better. How close are their respective RMSE values strictly depends on how far the actual propagation model is from an ideal pathloss. The more mismatched is the PL model the closer the APBM performance is to the NN, as in this case. It is worth noting that despite the large difference between the propagation scenarios, the APBM can seamlessly adapt to both without changes. Also, in this realistic scenario, the ability of the APBM to perform a successful P0-blind estimation is even more relevant, since this information is not usually available."

We investigated the use of an augmented physics-based model (APBM) approach that models the complex propagation channel with a physics-based pathloss model and a data-driven NN component, jointly estimating the position of the jamming source and the NN model parameters. The proposed method exhibited flexibility to characterize both ideal propagation conditions and complex urban scenarios, attaining a performance comparable to a perfect model-aware MLE in the first case, and better than a stand-alone NN in the latter. Moreover, such performance can be reached also with no information about the jamming source, thus without knowledge about the transmission power, a parameter not available in realistic scenarios. Further works will investigate the adaptability of the method in dynamic scenarios, involving a moving and intermittent jammer, considering also continual learning to address the changes in data distribution. To address privacy concerns, we intend to connect this work with federated learning schemes."
