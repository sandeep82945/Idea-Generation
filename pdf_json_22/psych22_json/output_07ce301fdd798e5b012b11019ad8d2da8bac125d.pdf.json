    "abstractText": "Objective: Social media (SM) have flourished and are affecting human lives on an unprece\u2010 dented scale. Problematic social media use (PSMU) is a recently emerging problematic behavior that affects both physical and mental health. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether prob\u2010 lematic users of SM display attentional bias (AB) toward SM\u2010related cues, as well as the relationships between AB, the severity of PSMU, and negative emotions. Method: 1000 college students were re\u2010 cruited through classes and online forums and then tested using the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS). Eventually, 60 participants, identified by the cut\u2010off point for BSMAS, consented to participate in the study andwere divided into two groups (i.e., a problematic use group and a typical use group). The severity of PSMU and negative emotions (i.e., anxiety, depression, social fear, and loneliness) were evaluated by self\u2010report questionnaires. AB was assessed by an addiction Stroop task and a dot\u2010probe task (DPT). Results: PSMU was found to be positively associated with anxiety (r = 0.28, p < 0.05), depression (r = 0.35, p < 0.01), and social fear (r = 0.38, p < 0.01), but not with loneli\u2010 ness (r = 0.19, p = 0.15). Participants with a tendency toward PSMU displayed AB toward SM\u2010related cues in the DPT [F (1, 58) = 26.77, p < 0.001, \u03b7p = 0.32], but not in the Stroop task [F (1, 58) = 0.61, p = 0.44, \u03b7p = 0.01]. Moreover, AB toward SM\u2010related stimuli was found to be positively correlated with the severity of PSMU (r = \u22120.51, p < 0.001), anxiety (r = \u22120.37, p < 0.01), depression (r = \u22120.51, p < 0.001), and social fear (r =\u22120.30, p < 0.05) in the DPT. Conclusions: Problematic users of SM show AB towards SM\u2010related cues in the DPT, which is more reliable for assessing AB than the Stroop task. Moreover, it is suggested that in clinical interventionswe shouldwork to change the AB towards SM\u2010 related stimuli and improve negative emotions to decrease risks of PSMU.",

People use SM to experience and engage in various types of social activities and entertainment, such as online social networking, playing games, sharing pictures, and passing time. SM not only provide great convenience for people to establish and expand their social relations, but also provide an important window through which people can understand external in\u2011 formation [1]. According to a 2021 Pew Research Center report, YouTube and Facebook dominate SM landscape in the U.S., attracting 81% and 69% of the adult population, re\u2011 spectively. Seven\u2011in\u2011ten Facebook users report that they use the site every day, including 49% of users who log in to the site several times a day. However, irrational use of SM may result in problematic social media use (PSMU), which refers to the compulsive and\nInt. J. Environ. Res.

A recent survey reported a potential prevalence rate for PSMU of 3.5% in a Chinese sample [3]. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in studies on the consequences of PSMU. For example, De Doncker and McLean found that PSMU is positively correlated with poor sleep quality and depressive symptoms [4]. Zhao revealed that compared with typical users of SM, problematic users of SM have lower subjective well\u2011being [5]. In addition, Ali Homaid found that PSMU induced both exhaustion and technostress, leading to decreased academic performance [6]. In the literature on PSMU, there has been considerable debate regarding whether PSMU should be regarded as a genuine addiction behavior. Although PSMU is not for\u2011 mally recognized in the current psychiatric nosology, a growing body of research has found that PSMU is similar to substance and behavioral addictions, exhibiting six core symptoms of addictions [7,8]: salience (time and energy spent in SM neglecting other ac\u2011 tivities), mood modification (using SM to experience a positive mood state and/or escape negative emotions and feelings of stress), tolerance (need to increase the intensity of SMuse to achieve the samemood effect), withdrawal (unpleasant feeling states and behavioral dis\u2011 comforts when the use of SM is discontinued or suddenly reduced), conflict (interpersonal and intrapsychic conflicts due to difficulty limiting the time and frequency of using SM), and relapse (a tendency to try to reduce or stop using SM, but failing, and thus returning to SM)."

            "text": "Negative emotions are potential risk factors for PSMU. The theory of an affective pro\u2011 cessing model of negative reinforcement explains the mechanism of the formation, main\u2011 tenance, and development of addictive behaviors from the perspective of emotional pro\u2011 cessing [9]. This theory suggests that negative emotions are the dominant motivation to maintain substance addiction and behavioral addictions. Individuals are more likely to form addictive behaviors when they wish to escape from negative emotions. Numerous studies have investigated the influences of anxiety, depression, social fear, and loneliness on PSMU. Severe or even moderate anxiety and/or depression may increase risks of devel\u2011 oping PSMU [10]. Compared with non\u2011users of the SM platform, people who use Face\u2011 book more often tend to suffer from insomnia and depression [11]. In addition, individu\u2011 als with high levels of social fear and loneliness are more likely to turn to SM as a way to avoid uncomfortable face\u2011to\u2011face interactions and compensate for the lack of offline rela\u2011 tionships [12]. For example, de B\u00e9rail et al. adopted the structural equationmodeling to ex\u2011 plore the relationship between social fear and PSMU. They found social fear increased risks of YouTube addiction, which directly and indirectly influenced addictive behavior [13]. In addition, a study by Primark et al. indicated that loneliness is one of the risk factors for PSMU [14]. To briefly summarize, these results suggest that negative emotions may par\u2011 tially contribute to the development of PSMU."

            "heading": "1.2. Attentional Bias towards Addiction\u2011Related Cues in Addictions",
            "text": "The contemporary conceptualization of addictive behaviors is not limited to substance addiction (e.g., nicotine addiction, alcohol abuse, and heroin dependence). Increasing re\u2011 search attention has been paid to various forms of behavioral addiction (e.g., online shop\u2011 ping addiction, pathological gambling, and online pornography). Substance and behav\u2011 ioral addictions are both thought to exhibit the same underlying biological psychosocial addictionmechanism [15]. It iswell\u2011established that addicts tend to direct their attention to addiction\u2011relevant cues in the form of attentional bias (AB), a strong tendency to prioritize the allocation of attentional resources to addiction\u2011related stimuli [16]. Researchers have adopted multiple paradigms to study AB in substance and behav\u2011 ioral addicts, including both indirect and direct measures. The addiction Stroop task, a modified version of the classic Stroop task, is an indirect measure most widely used to in\u2011 vestigate AB. The presence of AB can be inferred if participants\u2019 performance on the color\u2011\nnaming task is impaired when addiction\u2011relevant cues are presented simultaneously [17]. In general, a longer response time (RT) in the presence of addiction\u2011related stimuli suggests AB to addiction\u2011related cues. The dot\u2011probe task (DPT) is another commonly used indirect measure of how addiction\u2011related cues capture participants\u2019 visuospatial attention. In the DPT, a pair of stimuli consisting of an addiction\u2011relevant stimulus (e.g., a nicotine\u2011related picture) and a matched control stimulus (e.g., a landscape picture), is presented on the screen simultaneously. When the pair of stimuli disappears, a probe stimulus appears at the location previously occupied by either the addiction\u2011relevant stimulus or the control stimulus. The presence of AB is inferred from the comparison of participants\u2019 RT to the probe stimuli that replace addiction\u2011related cues vs. those that replace the control cues [18]. If the participants respond faster to a probe stimulus at the location of an addiction\u2011related stimulus than at the location of a neutral stimulus, one can infer AB to addiction\u2011related cues. Other less widely used indirect measurements include flicker\u2011induced change blind\u2011 ness paradigms, dual\u2011task procedures, and visual search paradigms [19]. Eye\u2011tracking technology, as a method of directly measuring AB, allows for the measurement of individ\u2011 uals\u2019 visuospatial selective attention when addiction\u2011related stimuli are presented. Numerous studies employing a range of experimental paradigms have revealed that there is a correlation between addiction and AB towards addiction\u2011related cues [20\u201322]. Currently, the most influential theoretical explanation of AB in substance addicts is the incentive\u2013sensitization theory [23]. According to this theory, addictive behaviors are per\u2011 sistent and progressive neuroadaptations caused by repeated substance use. The repeated exposure to highly pleasurable cues leads to hypersensitization of the reward systems in the brain that generate incentive salience toward addiction\u2011related cues. Incentive sensiti\u2011 zation produces both a bias of attentional processing towards substance\u2011relevant stimuli and pathological motivations for addictive stimuli: in other words, a principle of \u201cgrab attention, become attractive and wanted, and guide behavior to the incentive\u201d. The theory argues that \u201cwanting\u201d (strong motivation) drives compulsive behaviors in substance use more than \u201cliking\u201d (hedonic pleasure). The incentive\u2013sensitization theory was initially used only to explain substance addiction. Further studies have demonstrated that the theory can also explain behavioral addictions. Overall, the role of AB towards addiction\u2011 related cues is purported to play a significant role in the development, maintenance, and relapse stages of both substance and behavioral addictions [24]. PSMUdiffers frommost substance and behavioral addictions in that the availability of SM is so high that everyone has the opportunity to easily access it. Individuals can use SM ondifferent platforms for different activities. AlthoughAB towards addiction\u2011related stim\u2011 uli has been extensively studied in substance and behavioral addicts, it is not clear whether SM\u2011related cues have similarmotivational properties to capture andmaintain the attention of SM users. To the best of our knowledge, only two studies have explored AB in prob\u2011 lematic users of SM. However, their findings are inconsistent. Nikolaidou et al. used eye\u2011 tracking technology in combination with a DPT to assess AB and found that problematic users of SM tend to show increased attentional dwell times toward SM\u2011related stimuli [25]. Their findings support the hypothesis that the AB effect is a common underlying mecha\u2011 nism related to PSMU and other addictions. However, another study by Thomson et al. did not provide support for the presence of the AB effect in PSMU [26]. Their study found that problematic users of SM showed no preferential attentional capture by SM apps and notifications with a visual search paradigm. Furthermore, the engagement and severity of PSMU were not found to be correlated with the AB effect. The main reason for the differ\u2011 ent results may be the different paradigms used in the two studies. Hence, the issue of AB towards SM\u2011related stimuli in problematic users of SM needs to be explored further."

            "text": "The experience of negative mood is thought to be a reliable trigger of PSMU. Accord\u2011 ing to the theory of an affective processingmodel of negative reinforcement, negative emo\u2011 tions are the core symptoms of addiction withdrawal syndrome. Negative emotions can\ndisrupt an individual\u2019s homeostasis, which has been considered the key to the pathophys\u2011 iological maintenance of addiction, and enhance an individual\u2019s motivation to form and maintain addictive behaviors such as alcohol abuse, nicotine dependence, and other forms of addictions [9]. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that negative emotions increase AB towards addiction\u2011relevant cues in addicts and some evidence supports this hypothesis. For example, Field and Powell used the DPT and found that alcoholics showed increased AB towards alcohol\u2011related cues after stress and anxietywere induced, manifesting in both the initial orientation of attention and attentional retention [27]. For problematic users of SM, under negative emotions individuals actively seek SM\u2011related cues and direct their attention to the previous pleasurable events in order to escape from unhappiness and im\u2011 prove their emotional states. Therefore, we can speculate that problematic users of SM preferentially process SM\u2011related cues and use online chatting, games, shopping and other functions to alleviate negative emotions. To the best of our knowledge, no study has re\u2011 vealed any links betweenAB towards SM\u2011related cues in problematic users of SM and their negative emotions."

First, we explored the associations of negative emotions (i.e., anxiety, depression, social fear, and loneliness) with PSMU using self\u2011reported questionnaires. Second, an attempt was made using an addiction Stroop task and a DPT to examine whether SM addicts show AB towards SM\u2011 related stimuli. Both taskswere included to improve the reliability of the current study. We also tested whether the severity of PSMU is associated with AB towards SM\u2011related cues. Third, the link between AB and negative emotions was analyzed. It was hypothesized that:\nHypothesis 1 (H1): Negative emotions (i.e., anxiety, depression, social fear, and loneliness) are positively correlated with PSMU.\nHypothesis 2 (H2): SM addicts show greater AB towards SM\u2011related cues and the severity of PSMU is positively correlated with AB toward SM\u2011related stimuli.\nHypothesis 3 (H3): Increased AB toward SM\u2011related cues is positively correlated with higher levels of negative emotions."

Follow\u2011 ing the example of Hu et al. [28], in order to improve the internal reliability of this study, 30 participants were recruited for the problematic use group and typical use group, respec\u2011 tively. Considering that the prevalence of PSMU is approximately 3.5% [3], 1000 college students were recruited through classes and online forums at Guangzhou University and then tested using the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS). Inclusion criteria in\u2011 cluded fluency in Chinese, normal or corrected\u2011to\u2011normal vision, and the use of SM. Ex\u2011 clusion criteria included current or previous psychiatric conditions (schizophrenia, mood disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and somatoform disorders), and addiction be\u2011 haviors including gaming addiction, alcohol problems, and nicotine dependence. Struc\u2011 tured clinical interviews were used to determine whether participants met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. According to the previous study, the cut\u2011off point for BSMAS was 24 points [3]: if the BSMAS score was 24 or above, the participant was classified into the \u201cproblematic use group\u201d. Otherwise, the participant was classified into the \u201ctypical use group\u201d. Ultimately, 60 participants, including 30 in the problematic use group and 30 in\nthe typical use group, consented to participate in the experiment.

It comprises 6 items (e.g., \u201cHow often have you felt an urge to use SM during the last year?\u201d) measured on a 5\u2011point Likert scale (from 1 = very rarely to 5 = very often) with higher scores indicating greater levels of PSMU. The Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient for the BSMAS was 0.91 in the present study. Generalized Anxiety Disorder\u20117 (GAD\u20117): The Chinese version of the GAD\u20117 [31], adapted from Spitzer et al. [32], was used to measure anxiety. It comprises 7 items (e.g., \u201cI feel restless, anxious, and irritable\u201d) measured on a 4\u2011point Likert scale (from 0 = not at all to 3 = nearly every day) with higher scores indicating greater levels of anxiety. The Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient for the GAD\u20117 scale was 0.92 in the present study. Patient Health Questionnaire\u20119 (PHQ\u20119): The Chinese version of the PQH\u20119 [33], adapted from Kroenke et al. [34], was used to measure depression. It comprises 9 items (e.g., \u201cI feel down, depressed or hopeless\u201d) measured on a 4\u2011point Likert scale (from 0 = not at all to 3 = nearly every day) with higher scores indicating greater levels of depression. The Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient for the PHQ\u20119 scale was 0.79 in the present study. Anxiety Scale (IAS): The Chinese version of the IAS [35], adapted from Leary [36], was used to measure social fear. It comprises 15 items (e.g., \u201cI will be nervous during an interview\u201d) measured on a 5\u2011point scale (from 1 = not at all consistent to 5 = extremely consistent) with higher scores indicating greater levels of social fear. The Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient for this scale was 0.89 in the present study. UCLA Loneliness Scale: The Chinese version of this scale [37]., adapted from Russell [38], was adopted to measure loneliness. It comprises 20 items (e.g., \u201cDo you often feel that no one can be trusted?\u201d) measured on a 4\u2011point scale (from 1 = never to 4 = always) with higher scores indicating greater levels of loneliness. The Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient for this scale was 0.93 in the present study. Addiction Stroop task: Before the task, 15 college students who did not participate in this experiment were asked to rate the extent of SM\u2011related words and neutral words on a 5\u2011point Likert scale (from 1 = extremely inconsistent to 5 = extremely consistent). Ultimately, 20 SM\u2011relatedwords (e.g., WeChat, Weibo, circle of friends) and 20 neutral words referring to daily necessities (e.g., desk, glasses, and shampoo) were chosen for use in the formal experiment. SM\u2011related words and neutral words were matched in similarity, frequency, and length. The experimental program was written and ran on E\u2011Prime. The stimuli were pre\u2011 sented on a 27\u2011inch LCD monitor with 1024 \u00d7 768 pixels resolution and a 60 Hz refresh rate. During the task, a fixation cross (+) with a duration of 500 milliseconds (ms) was first presented at a 60 cm viewing distance. After the fixation cross disappeared, a stimulus in Arial, font size 48, was displayed in the center of the screen. Words were presented se\u2011 quentially in a block, in randomized order, with their color either blue or red, resulting in 80 stimuli for each block. The task comprised 3 blocks and a total of 240 trials. Participants were required to recognize the color of each stimulus as accurately and quickly as possible, while ignoring the actual meaning of the stimulus. If thewordwas red, the participant was required to press the \u201cF\u201d key. If the word was blue, the participant was required to press the \u201cJ\u201d key. Each word remained onscreen until either a key was pressed or 3000 ms had elapsed (Figure 1). No color or word was presented more than twice consecutively. There was a 30 sec break between each block and the next block was initiated by the participant.\nBefore the formal experiment, participants performed 20 practice trials with feedback to ensure that they understood the requirements and procedures. The stimuli used in the practice were not reused in the formal experiment.\nAddiction DPT: Stimuli for the addiction DPT were selected as described for the ad\u2011 diction Stroop task. The timeline of the addiction DPT is shown in Figure 2. During the task, a fixation cross \u201c+\u201d was presented first at the center of the screen for a duration of 500 ms. It was followed by a 1000 ms presentation of a pair of words (one SM\u2011related word and one neutral word) located on the left and right sides of the cross. A blank was presented for 50 ms, followed by a probe dot. Participants were asked to determine the location of the probe dot: they were instructed to press the \u201cF\u201d or \u201cJ\u201d key if the probe appeared on the left or right side of the screen, respectively. The probe remained on the screen until either a key was pressed or 2000 ms had elapsed. Finally, a blank screen was presented for 500 ms and the next trial was performed. As in the addiction Stroop task, participants were first provided 20 practice trials with feedback to ensure that they under\u2011 stood the procedure. Next, each participant was shown 20 pairs \u00d7 2 probe positions \u00d7 2 picture positions (i.e., 80 trials) in a fully randomized order in one block with no feed\u2011 back. Participants performed a total of 240 trials, which were divided into three blocks with a 30 ms interval between each. Two types of trials were used in the paradigm, e.g., congruent (the probe appeared where the SM\u2011related words had appeared) and in\u2011 congruent (the probe appeared where the neutral words had appeared). Stimuli in Arial, font size 48, were presented on both sides of the screen. The center of the probe dot was 12 cm from the center of the screen."

This is consistent with the study by Zhao, which suggested that social fear is a potential risk factor for PSMU [12]. People who have difficulty express\u2011 ing themselves in face\u2011to\u2011face social environments prefer to express themselves on SM, where they can express themselves more easily and perceive less risk. Interestingly, this study found the correlation between loneliness and PSMU to be relatively low. This is in\u2011 consistent with previous studies that have indicated that loneliness may increase the risk of PSMU [14,41]. It has been postulated that a lack of correlation between loneliness and PSMU may attributable to the fact that more lonely individuals experience greater stress while using SM than less lonely individuals, limiting their ability to realize the potential benefits of PSMU [42]."

            "text": "This study used two experimental tasks to explore whether problematic users of SM showed AB towards SM\u2011related cues. The problematic use group was found to display a specific AB toward SM\u2011related stimuli in the addiction DPT. This result supports our hypothesis that SM addicts have a greater AB towards SM\u2011related stimuli. AB towards addiction\u2011related cues is considered to account for the maintenance of the addiction cycle [20,25]. Nikolaidou et al. previously found that problematic users of SM tend to show an increased AB towards SM\u2011related stimuli [25], but contrarily, Thomson et al. found that there was no special AB effect towards SM\u2011related cues in problematic users [26]. The current study was consistent with the former finding. There have been many studies sup\u2011 porting the claim that AB towards addiction\u2011related information plays an important role in addiction behavior. For example, Wilcockson et al. [43] used a behavioral inhibition task and a DPT to find that compared with the non\u2011smokers, dependent smokers showed de\u2011 creased inhibition and increased AB for smoking\u2011related cues. Similarly, Kim et al. found that people with online gaming disorder showed AB towards game\u2011related stimuli using eye\u2011tracking technology and their study supported that AB towards addiction\u2011relevant cues was one of the core symptoms of addictive behaviors [44]. The current study found that SM\u2011related information can capture the attention of problematic users of SM; thus, we are more inclined to suggest that PSMU is an addictive behavior and thus exhibits similar addiction mechanisms to behavioral addiction. Additionally, in agreement with studies that have shown that the AB effect may indicate the severity of the addiction [45], our study found a negative correlation between the severity of PSMU and the index of AB to\u2011 wards SM\u2011related cues in the DPT. In other words, the more serious individuals\u2019 PSMU,\nthe more attention resources they devote to SM\u2011related information. This result suggests that AB toward SM\u2011related cues may be a reliable indicator of the severity of PSMU. Interestingly, in the addiction Stroop task, we found neither an AB effect in SM ad\u2011 dicts, nor a significant relationship between severity of PSMU and AB. Contrary to our current results, Jeromin et al. used a Stoop task and a DPT to study the AB of excessive Internet gamers, and found that in the Stroop task, excessive Internet gamers responded more slowly to computer\u2011related words than to neutral words, but in the DPT, there was no difference between targets following neutral and computer\u2011related images [46]. This discrepancy may be because of the following reasons: First, stimuli were presented on the screen side by side in the DPT, while all stimuli were presented at the center of the screen in the Stroop task. When using words as stimulus material, the DPT is a more sensitive tool for assessing AB than the Stroop task. Second, the relatively long duration of stimulus presentation (3000ms) in the Stroop taskmay have allowedparticipants to consciously con\u2011 trol their attentional resources. Garland et al. used an addiction Stroop task with a 100 ms inter\u2011stimulus interval and found that an automatic AB for substance\u2011related stimuli plays a major role in provoking cravings in alcohol\u2011dependent individuals [47]. Over time, AB towards addiction\u2011related cues becomes automatic and implicit. Third, the Stroop task may have poor stability and reliability. Several studies have failed to find an association between addiction and AB using the addiction Stroop task [48,49]. Last, a possible expla\u2011 nation for this inconsistency could be that the Stroop task may be too easy for problematic users of SM. Hence, it can be concluded that the DPT paradigm is a more reliable measure\u2011 ment for evaluating AB than the addiction Stroop task, as found in the current study."

            "text": "This was the first study to look at the relationship between AB towards SM\u2011related cues and negative emotions. In the DPT, AB was found to be positively associated with negative emotions, especially anxiety, depression, and social fear. This result can be ex\u2011 plained by the theory of an affective processing model of negative reinforcement [9]. Ac\u2011 cording to this theory, negative emotions are an important factor in maintaining addictive behaviors. In order to escape from unpleasant feelings and improve their emotional level, addicts actively seek addictive cues or form addictive behaviors. This study supports the findings of Field and Powell [27], which showed that negative emotions can increase the AB of addicts toward addiction\u2011related cues. Interestingly, this study found that ABwas positively correlatedwith anxiety, depres\u2011 sion, and social fear, but had a relatively low correlation with loneliness. According to the theory of the antecedent model of Internet addiction and psychological adaptation, Inter\u2011 net addiction can lead to psychological maladaptation. Prior research has found that ad\u2011 diction and depression often occur together. Addictionmay increase the risk of depression and is an important predictor of depression [50]. A study by Ciarrochi et al., confirmed through a four\u2011year study of adolescents that Internet addiction is a consistent factor lead\u2011 ing to depression [51]. Problematic users of SM have a higher probability of suffering from major depressive disorder. PSMU has been found to be positively correlated with depres\u2011 sion and is considered to be a significant risk factor in the occurrence and development of depression [52]. As this study found, significant AB often predicts severe PSMU. Based on the studies described above, we can understand that there is a positive correlation between AB and depression. Anxiety is generally considered to be highly correlated with depres\u2011 sion. Jacobson and Newman explored the relationship between early anxiety and later depression using a longitudinal tracking approach and found that anxiety predicts later depression in structural equationmodels [53]. Therefore, we can understand the close con\u2011 nection between anxiety and AB toward SM\u2011related cues. In addition, there is a significant positive correlation between social fear and PSMU, as found in the present study. With an increase in individuals\u2019 dependence on SM, they spend more time and energy on SM, and less time and energy on interpersonal communication and other activities, thus weaken\u2011 ing their sense of self\u2011efficacy, enhancing their sense of loneliness, and ultimately leading\nto social fear [50]. Therefore, we can conclude that individuals\u2019 greater AB towards SM\u2011 related cues can increase their risk of social fear. The relatively weak correlation between loneliness and AB towards SM\u2011related cues is mainly due to the greater stress experienced by lonely individuals, limiting their ability to realize the potential benefits of PSMU [42]. Therefore, SM\u2011related stimuli fail to capture their attention."

PSMU was found to be positively correlated with anx\u2011 iety, depression, and social fear. Individuals with PSMU showed significant AB toward SM\u2011related cues in the DPT paradigm, but not in the addiction Stroop task. Moreover, AB toward SM\u2011related stimuli was positively correlated with the severity of PSMU, anxi\u2011 ety, depression, and social fear in the DPT paradigm. Future interventions for SM addicts may start with correcting their AB with AB modification programs to decrease the risk of PSMU. Supporting evidence comes from the study of Kakoschke et al. to discourage the consumption of unhealthy food [54]. In the \u2018attend healthy\u2019 group, 90% of the dot probes were at the locations of healthy foods, while in the \u2018attend unhealthy\u2019 group, 90% of the dot probes were at the locations of unhealthy foods. Their study found that participants in the \u2018attend healthy\u2019 group showed an increased AB toward healthy foods\u2011relevant cues and ate relatively more healthy snacks than the participants in the \u2018attend unhealthy\u2019 group."

            "text": "The present study has some limitations. First, only BSMAS was used in diagnosing PSMU. Because PSMU is a controversial diagnosis, whether a single scale can accurately distinguish and identify such behaviors remains debatable. Second, in the Stroop task, the presentation time of the stimuli was too long, which may have affected the reliability of the Stroop task. Third, word stimuli were used in both the Stroop task and the DPT as experimental materials, and the ecological effect of text may not be as good as that of pictures. The conflicting findings of this study indicate that other research paradigms are needed to explore AB in PSMU. Fourth, the sample size of this study was relatively small, and only correlation analysis between variables was performed. Correlation analysis is a cross\u2011sectional method and cannot be used to infer causal relationships between variables. Thus, the relationships between AB, PSMU, and negative emotions should be further ex\u2011 plored using other techniques. Fifth, most of the stimuli used in the two tasks are related more to platform names rather than specific types of content or behavioral engagements within platforms, which arguably are the things driving behavioral use and therefore prob\u2011 lematic use. Finally, this study was a behavioral experiment, and the results may be more convincing if combined with eye\u2011tracking technology or brain imaging. In future studies, first, a variety of approaches including structured clinical interviews are needed to validate the diagnosis whether individuals are prone to PUMU. Second, we can decrease the stimulus presentation time to further explore the AB effect in the Stroop task. Third, SM\u2011related images can be used as materials to improve the ecological impact of the stimuli. The Stroop task is a measure of an individual\u2019s selective attention and re\u2011 sponse suppression, while DPT is a measure of an individual\u2019s spatial attention. Other research paradigms such as flicker\u2011induced change blindness paradigms, dual\u2011task proce\u2011 dures, and visual search paradigms can be used to exploreAB in PSMU. Fourth, the sample size can be increased to explore whether PSMU is a mediator or moderator between AB and negative emotions. Longitudinal tracking studies can be performed to explore the causal relationships between AB, PSMU, and negative emotions. Fifth, in terms of stimu\u2011 lus selection, specific types of content or behavioral engagements within SM platforms can be selected, rather than limited to SM\u2011related names, so as to more objectively evaluate the AB of problematic users of SM. Lastly, the mechanism of AB in problematic users of SM\ncan be explored by combining event\u2011related potential analysis, eye\u2011movement tracking, and brain imaging technology.\nAuthor Contributions: Data curation, Z.Z. and L.Z.; Funding acquisition, S.F.; Investigation, J.Z. and Z.Z.; Methodology, J.Z., B.S., X.Z. and L.Z.; Project administration, S.F.
