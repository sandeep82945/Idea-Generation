    "abstractText": "The government-led Chinese economic development system determines that local government competition is a significant factor affecting the economic low-carbon transition. Driving an economic development mode with green technology innovation as the core is the critical path to realizing an economic low-carbon transition. Consequently, it is of significant practical relevance to investigate the impact of local government competition and green technology innovation on the economic lowcarbon transition under the government-led Chinese economic development system. This paper systematically explores the nexus between green technology innovation and economic low-carbon transition in terms of local government competition perspective using the system generalized method of moments, panel threshold model, and geographically weighted regression on the basis of a dataset of 30 provincial administrative areas in China from a period of 2006\u20132019. The results indicate that green technology innovation significantly promotes the economic low-carbon transition. Local government competition not only significantly dampens the economic low-carbon transition but also considerably inhibits the positive effect of green technology innovation on the economic low-carbon transition. A significant N-shaped association is evident between green technology innovation and the economic low-carbon transition when green technology innovation is applied as a threshold, while such association is insignificant when local government competition is used as a threshold. Compared with highcompetition intensity areas, green technology innovation promotes economic low-carbon transition weaker in lowcompetition intensity areas, while local government competition inhibits economic low-carbon transition stronger. However, local government competition significantly inhibits the positive effect of green technology innovation on the economic low-carbon transition in low-competition intensity areas, while insignificant in high-competition intensity areas. The geographically weighted regression technique as a whole also verified the above results. Therefore, policymakers should not only increase research and development investment in green technologies, but also develop a regionally linked low-carbon emission reduction system to avoid ineffective competition among governments to facilitate the earlier fulfillment of the \u201cdual carbon\u201d goal.",

            "text": "As the world economy recovers from COVID-19, carbon emissions linked to energy are rebounding rapidly (Shah et\u00a0al. 2022; Ray et\u00a0al. 2022; Razzaq et\u00a0al. 2020). It is estimated that China will contribute over 11.9 billion tons of carbon emissions in 2021, which is 33% of the global total, according to the latest analysis by the International Energy Agency (IEA).1 Meanwhile, National Bureau of Statistics data reveal that Chinese raw coal production volume reached 4.13 billion tons in 2021, up 55.7% yearon-year, and coal consumption increased by 4.6%.2The disorderly expansion of China\u2019s economic development has destroyed enormous amounts of natural resources and exacerbated ecological degradation, posing a great threat to environmental protection and sustainable economic development (Zahoor et\u00a0al. 2022; Xu et\u00a0al. 2022; Jia et\u00a0al. 2022). China explicitly introduced the goals of \u201ccarbon peak\u201d by 2030 and \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d by 2060 at the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2020 (Shi and Xu 2022; Xin et\u00a0al. 2022; Zhao et\u00a0al. 2022). Subsequently, in October 2021, the Chinese government promulgated the \u201cOpinions on Complete and Accurate Implementation of the New Development Concept to Do a Good Job of Carbon Peaking and Carbon Neutral Work\u201d; since then, the low-carbon transition and high-quality development of the economy under the double carbon goal has gradually emerged as a consensus society (Chen et\u00a0al. 2022a, b).\nSimultaneously, green technology innovation plays an increasingly vital role in economic low-carbon transition as an essential driver of low-carbon economic transition (Razzaq et\u00a0al. 2022; Hao et\u00a0al. 2022). Green technology is a universal designation for all processes and technologies that can minimize energy and resource consumption and reduce environmental pollution (Gao et\u00a0al. 2022; Cao et\u00a0al. 2021). Compared with general technological innovation, green technology innovation emphasizes resource conservation and environmental protection, which can effectively strengthen resource and energy utilization efficiency (Wicki and Hansen, 2019). Also, green technology innovation is widely applied in enterprises, and micro-individuals will boost enterprises\u2019 clean production and drive residents\u2019 green consumption to realize an economic low-carbon transition from the production and consumption sides (Liao and Li 2022). Moreover, green technology innovation in the energy sector is beneficial to the extrusion induced by the consumption of traditional energy sources, reducing the cost\nof green energy usage and transitioning the energy consumption structure to low-carbon and clean energy (Dong et\u00a0al. 2022). Thus, exploring economic low-carbon development powered by green technology innovation has been an essential path for the Chinese economic low-carbon transition.\nAs for the green technology innovation level enhancement and innovation capacity intensification, local governments\u2019 support is indispensable. The Chinese government, as the leader of regional economic and social development, can allocate factors and guide industrial transition through various ways such as policy formulation, tax relief, and financial support, and its competitive behavior and intensity will influence local green technology innovation development, which in turn will have appropriate effects on economic low-carbon transition (Feng et\u00a0al. 2022; Sovacool 2021). On the one hand, under the context of economic performance as the key political incentive, local officials may, to maximize jurisdictional interests, distort the fiscal expenditure structure and increase investment in projects that can stimulate economic growth in the short term (Wang et\u00a0al. 2022; Yan et\u00a0al. 2022). Meanwhile, policy incentives related to green technology innovation with high risks and long payoff cycles are lessened, resulting in a lack of motivation for green technology innovation in research and development, universities, and enterprises (Shang et\u00a0al. 2022). On the other hand, local governments are competing for green technology innovations that can yield environmental benefits as political incentives gradually shift to eco-efficiency. Research and development activities associated with green technology innovation are also gradually gaining attention from local governments, which are strengthening their innovation-driven development strategies to enhance green technology innovation performance (Chen et\u00a0al. 2022a, b).\nAs the Chinese government is an influential practitioner and participant in global ecological civilization, it is economical, and social low-carbon development efforts have already formed an increasingly significant part of the global climate governance system. Thus, it is of practical meaning to consider the impact of green technology innovation on the economic low-carbon transition. So, what is the potential effect of green technology innovation on the economic low-carbon transition? Considering that the natural characteristics and socio-development differ significantly from one area to another in China, and the economic base and the development level also differ, what is the role of green technology innovation in the process of economic low-carbon transition in different areas? What is the role of local government competition in the economic low-carbon transition through intensified competition in the market economy? Under the current innovation-driven development strategy, answering the above questions can be used as an empirical reference 1 See more detail: https:// www. iea. org/ repor ts/ global- energy- review2021? langu age= zh 2 http:// www. stats. gov. cn\n1 3\nfor China to address the energy and environmental constraints and fulfill the \u201cdouble carbon\u201d goal, while simultaneously contributing to the development of low-carbon transition in economies similar to China. As such, this paper systematically explores the nexus between green technology innovation and economic low-carbon transition in terms of local government competition perspective using the system generalized method of moments (SYS-GMM), panel threshold model, and geographically weighted regression on the basis of a dataset of 30 provincial administrative areas in China from a period of 2006\u20132019.\nThis paper mainly broadens the scope of existing research with regard to the following dimensions. First, unlike previous studies, this paper incorporates local government competition, green technology innovation, and economic low-carbon transition into one integrated analytical framework to investigate the association among the three, to generate empirical evidence for a low-carbon transition in China. Second, the influence of green technology innovation on economic low-carbon transition under local government competition in different areas is evaluated in the light of regional heterogeneity to identify a more target-oriented and appropriate path for low-carbon governance. Thirdly, using SYS-GMM, panel threshold model, and geographically weighted regression to quantitatively evaluate the three associations, which serve as valuable guidelines for adjusting local government competition and rationally utilizing green technology innovation to boost low-carbon economic transition.\nThe remainder of the article is organized as follows: the second section is the \u201cLiterature review,\u201d which aims to review the current research findings on local government competition, green technology innovation, and economic low-carbon transition, drawing on the lessons learned from previous research and identifying the shortcomings of previous studies. The third section is \u201cTheoretical analysis and research hypothesis,\u201d which introduces this paper\u2019s mechanism and research ideas. The fourth section is a description of the methodology and data. The fifth section furnishes the study\u2019s results and a detailed discussion of the results. The final section concludes with recommendations and identifies the limitations and deficiencies of the paper."

            "text": "Local government competition, green technology innovation, and economic low-carbon transition are popular issues discussed by scholars. However, there are short\nworks to classify the three in a common framework. This paper is devoted to sorting out the available studies on green technology innovation and economic low-carbon transition and local government competition, and economic low-carbon transition to establish a research basis for further analysis.\nResearch on\u00a0green technology innovation and\u00a0economic low\u2011carbon transition\nTechnological progress is the root of energy saving and emission control, while green technological innovation is crucial to economic low-carbon transition (Ikram 2022; Sun et\u00a0al. 2021). As early as the late nineteenth century, scholars from the neoclassical school of economics had already identified the significant role of production technology on economic growth. Along with economic development, technological progress is emerging as a core driver of stable economic growth and the optimal way to guide changes in economic growth patterns (Xie et\u00a0al. 2021; Sadik-Zada 2021). Hasanov et\u00a0al. (2021), for example, reveal that technological progress facilitates carbon mitigation while GDP growth aggravates carbon emissions. The literature on green technology innovation and economic low-carbon transition is categorized into the following fields.\nFirst, a definition is given to the green technology concept. The formal concept of green technology is derived from Braun and Wield\u2019s (1994) definition, which considers green technology as a general term for processes and technologies that can minimize adverse environmental effects by saving resources, reducing pollution and carbon emissions, resulting in a natural link between green technology innovation and low-carbon development (Nazir, 2021). Later, scholars such as Rennings and Zwick (2002) incorporated sustainable development into their definition of green technology innovation and diversified its connotation. As green development evolves, scholars have classified green technologies in terms of cleaner production, pollution control, and environmental protection (Arslan et\u00a0al. 2022; Demirel and Kesidou 2011; Varbanov et\u00a0al. 2021), broadened their connotation and scope of application, and developed them to micro-enterprise level research, arguing that enterprises are subject to green technological innovation development and are the starting point for technology diffusion (Lu et\u00a0al. 2022). Second, research on green technology innovation assessment. Measuring green technology innovation is mainly divided into surveying its level and dynamic mechanism, and scholars usually quantify its level using technology input (Costa-Campi et\u00a0al. 2017) or patent grants (Cai et\u00a0al. 2020) and utilize approaches such as structural equations to survey the dynamic mechanism affecting its change.\n1 3\nIkram et\u00a0al. (2021) evaluate green technology indicators in several dimensions and identify energy utilization, recycling, and ecological agriculture as critical factors influencing green technology.\nFinally, exploring the association between green technological innovation and low-carbon transition. The promotion of technological innovation in economic low-carbon transition has been more widely proven by scholars (Dong et\u00a0al. 2022; Sovacool et\u00a0al. 2022). Li et\u00a0al. (2019) suggest that technological progress can effectively boost industrial sectors\u2019 green development and economic lowcarbon transition. Scholars such as Ghisetti and Quatraro (2017) also point out that technological innovation significantly contributes to the green economy and lowcarbon development. Pradhan and Ghosh (2022) argue that endogenous technological innovations in new energy sources facilitate low-carbon goals, while green innovations represented by carbon capture and storage technologies contribute to carbon abatement at a lower economic cost. Moreover, Shan et\u00a0al. (2021) reveal that green technology innovation reduces carbon emissions. However, some scholars hold different opinions. They believe that the precise impacts of green technology innovations on carbon productivity are still unknown. For example, Eikeland and Skj\u00e6rseth (2021) argue that corporate technological innovation does not significantly impact green, low-carbon development. It can be noted that, in general, scholars believe that green technological innovation can facilitate economic low-carbon transition by enhancing resource and energy utilization. However, many current studies only substitute technological innovation for green technological innovation for research, resulting in poor representation of green features in green technological innovation.\nResearch on\u00a0local government competition and\u00a0economic low\u2011carbon transition\nLocal government competition is defined as the crossregional competition among local governments in economic, environmental, and social services to attract labor, capital, and other production factors (Zavadskaya and Shilov 2021; Zhang et\u00a0al. 2021). Local governments in China are the tangible implementers of the central government\u2019s environmental governance policies (Beck 2022). Local governments are inf luenced both politically and economically by the central government. Political centralization forces local governments to preserve the environment during economic development (Liu et\u00a0al. 2022b), while economic decentralization empowers local governments with a certain degree of autonomy that can trigger competition among local governments by biasing them toward\neconomic development (Wu et\u00a0al. 2020a). However, as the central government pays more attention to environmental protection, environmental performance will bring new incentives to reduce the competitive strength of local governments for economic growth (Yang et\u00a0al. 2020).\nThe idea of government competition can be traced back to Adam Smith\u2019s \u201cWealth of Nations,\u201d in which government competition is given in terms of the effect of tax differentials between governments on factor f lows (Aschenbrenner, 2021). Later, Tiebout (1956) introduces the concept of \u201cvoting by feet,\u201d in which local governments adjust government tax rates to induce factor inf lows and enhance the well-being of regional residents. Subsequently, Owens (2022) also examines the impact of local government competition on regional services from fiscal and taxation perspectives. As can be observed, early competition research on government has mainly emphasized fiscal and social welfare aspects (Murshed et\u00a0al., 2022). Breton\u00a0and Breton (1997), who first presented the concept of \u201cgovernment competition\u201d as a whole, argued that governments compete for resources, control, and public services. Omodero (2022) identifies that fiscal decentralization positively reflects on residents\u2019 social welfare. After entering the twenty-first century, the concepts of green, low-carbon, and sustainable development have been deeply rooted, and the concept of government competition has been gradually introduced into the research on the local environment and ecological protection (Gan et\u00a0al. 2021; Li 2022). On the whole, research on local government competition and economic low-carbon transition is categorized into two main aspects: the promotion theory and the inhibition theory. Nie et\u00a0al. (2022), for example, finds that local government competition on the environment has a positive impact on green innovation, and there is a significant spatial spillover effect. Moreover, some scholars hold different views, such as Liu et\u00a0al. (2022b) and Yang\u00a0et al. (2022a). The latter argue that the GDPoriented view of performance and official promotion tournaments make local governments actively reduce environmental protection, exacerbate the existence of regional market segmentation of \u201cbeggar-thy-neighbor,\u201d worsen the competitive relationship between local governments, and crowd out the cost of technological innovation, and weaken the ability of local economies to make a low-carbon transition. Deng et\u00a0al. (2019) confirm that the inverted U-shaped relationship between political competition and enterprises\u2019 optimal level of green technology innovation is related to the incentive coefficient of local government investment behavior set by the central government.\n1 3\nReviewing the literature on local government competition and economic low-carbon transition shows that more scholars have focused on the impact of local government competition on green development. At the same time, there are still relatively few systematic studies on local government competition and economic low-carbon transition. Although numerous scholars have conducted normative and empirical studies on local government competition, technological innovation, and low carbon, there are still some limitations. For example, few scholars have included these themes within a unified research framework, and there are earlier definitions and evaluation methods on green technology innovation that are not precise. Based on this, this paper redefines the level of green technology innovation and low-carbon economic transition. It examines the relationship between local government competition, green technology innovation, and economic low-carbon transition by integrating them into a unified analytical framework through both normative and empirical aspects."

            "text": "Low-carbon development is the essence of improving the efficiency of energy and resource utilization, and green technology innovation capability is undoubtedly the most effective way to increase energy utilization efficiency and tackle resource shortage (Dong et\u00a0al. 2022).\nFrom the energy utilization scenario, green technology innovation can drive extensive use of green renewable energy and enhance the development and application of clean energy (Razzaq et\u00a0al. 2021; Xin et\u00a0al. 2022). Meanwhile, it will also impel to reduce the proportion of fossil energy in energy consumption, boost the adjustment and optimization of regional energy structure, and curb the pollution caused to ecology and environment during energy production and utilization. Moreover, the advancement of green technology innovation may boost the development of production processes and applications, and improve traditional energy utilization efficiency (Gao et\u00a0al. 2022). Considering resource utilization, the development of green technology innovation advances the areas to reshape the regional production model through high technology to strengthen the output rate of resources and recycling rate (Hasanov et\u00a0al., 2021). Furthermore, this will also form a development system of green production, green distribution, and green consumption, which will in turn influence the change of residents\u2019 lifestyles and values, and ultimately promote the low-carbon transition of the regional economy (see Fig.\u00a01). Based on this, the following hypotheses are put forward:\nH1: green technology innovation plays a significant role in promoting economic low-carbon transition.\nThe Chinese decentralization model has the characteristics of the principal-agent relationship, which leads\n1 3\nto the information asymmetry between the central and local governments (Yang et\u00a0al. 2022a; Zhao et\u00a0al. 2021). Therefore, the superior government often selects some explicit indicators to assess the lower-level government officials. The relatively easy to judge economic development has become the main basis for assessing the lower-level officials (Hao et\u00a0al. 2021). Under this decentralized mode, local governments, as the \u201cagent\u201d of economic development, have economic development autonomy, and form \u201cbenchmarking competition\u201d under the incentive of economic performance assessment and promotion mechanism (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2021; Yang et\u00a0al. 2022c). The effect of local government competition on the economic low-carbon transition can be subject to shocks at different levels of economic development and geographic locations. (Wu et\u00a0al. 2020a). Economic development level in eastern China is relatively high, and local governments have a stronger preference for economic development, and its competition intensity is also particularly strong. Under high competition intensity, pursuing economic development speed and actively carrying out productive investment has become the primary goal of local governments. The \u201cpromotion tournament\u201d centered on economic growth will lead to local governments reducing environmental regulation intensity for economic development, tolerating and even supporting highly polluting enterprises development, and creating a situation of predatory development of resources, which is not conducive to the low-carbon transformation of local economies (Liu et\u00a0al. 2022a; Ju and Ke 2022). However, the central and western areas of China are rich in resources, and the ecological environment is often fragile, and its competition intensity is also relatively weak (Gan et\u00a0al., 2021). The central government has higher requirements for the local ecological environment. According to the foot voting theory, when regions have a higher preference for the environment, the government will set stricter environmental standards to reduce carbon emissions in the production process (Li 2022). At this time, the inhibition of local government competition on low-carbon transformation is not as obvious as that in the eastern region.\nH2: Affected by competition intensity, and the impact of local government competition on economic low-carbon transition are characterized by heterogeneity.\nAs further economic development and environmental pressure accumulate, economic and social low-carbon transition is inevitable. The central government also requires localities to take the path of ecological priority and green development, and support green technology innovation to achieve the dual carbon goal (Feng et\u00a0al.\n2022). However, green technology innovation can be profoundly influenced by local government competition. Under the way of economic growth as the primary assessment, GDP index is the core basis for officials\u2019 assessment and promotion (Wu et\u00a0al. 2020a). Pursuing the speed of economic growth, favoring short-term achievements in regional development, and accelerating the catching up and surpassing of neighboring and even national benchmark regions have become the rational choice of regional government officials (Liu et\u00a0al. 2022b). As a result, once local governments invest more financial resources in the development of stimulating economic growth in their jurisdictions through fiscal and tax incentives, they will compress their investment in green technology and technological innovation (Deng et\u00a0al. 2022). In addition, there may be a race among governments to lower environmental regulation standards to attract investment in high energyconsuming industries (Jia et\u00a0al., 2022). They may even conspire with highly polluting local enterprises to sacrifice ecological quality in exchange for high economic growth. For the increasingly tightened central environmental policies, they are implemented through tokenism, which ultimately inhibits the contribution of green technological innovation toward economic low-carbon transition. Based on the above analysis, the following hypothesis is proposed. The specific mechanistic analysis can be seen in Fig.\u00a01.\nH3: Local government competition will inhibit the contribution of green technology innovation to economic lowcarbon transition."

And the system GMM model has been more extensively used as compared to the differential GMM model which can solve the weak instrumental variables. This paper bridges local government competition, green technology innovation, and economic low-carbon transition to investigate the impact of green technology innovation on economic low-carbon transition with local government competition. In addition, the dependent variable in the current period may be confounded by the dependent variable in the previous period. Referring to Wu et\u00a0al. (2021), this paper opts to introduce the lag term of the economic low-carbon\n1 3\ntransition and conducts the analysis using SYS-GMM. The specific model settings are as follows:\nNext, in order to identify the impact of the interaction between local government competition and green technology innovation on economic low-carbon transition, the interaction term of the two is added to Eq.\u00a0(1). The specific model is set as follows.\nwhere i and t are province and time, respectively. LTC is the dependent variable, i.e., economic low-carbon transition. LTCit\u22121 represents the lagged term of economic lowcarbon transition. GTECH is green technology innovation, and Comp is local government competition. Inter is the interaction term of green technology innovation and local government competition with decentralization, and X is the control variable.\nConsidering that green technology innovation at various levels will exert a heterogeneous impact on economic low-carbon transition, thus green technology innovation is taken as a threshold variable to investigate the specific impact of green technology innovation at various levels on economic low-carbon transition. Taking the singlethreshold model as an example, the specific setting form is as follows.\nMoreover, green technology innovation may likewise influence economic low-carbon transition in a nonlinear manner under the changing role of local government competition. To verify the above effects, the model is constructed by using local government competition as a threshold variable as follows.\nwhere I(\u22c5) is the indicator function.

To further explore the impact of green technology innovation and local government competition on economic low-carbon transition, this paper takes spatial factors into account to analyze the spatial heterogeneity of the object to be studied. Since the traditional geographically weighted regression model may yield insufficient estimation power of the model parameters, referring to Yang et\u00a0al. (2022b), a temporal dimension is introduced to construct a geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) to make the estimation results more effective. The GTWR takes into account the heterogeneity of explanatory variables across spatial geographic locations. The model is set up as follows.\nThe temporal distance dijST is\nThe temporal weighting function takes the following form.\nwhere (ui, vi, ti) is the latitude, longitude, and time of 30 provincial administrative regions in China, bST is the bandwidth of the spatio-temporal function, and the optimal bandwidth is verified by crossover."

In addition, the change trend of economic low-carbon transition is more consistent across regions, but the gap in the level of economic low-carbon transition between areas is widening. In 2006, the standard deviation and extreme deviation of the level of economic low-carbon transition among Chinese regions were 0.082 and 0.328, respectively, and in 2019, they expanded to 0.092 and 0.374, respectively. By areas, the level of economic low-carbon transition in eastern regions is higher, such as Beijing, Guangdong Province, Shanghai, and Zhejiang Province, while the central and western regions have lower levels of economic lowcarbon transition, such as Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai and Xinjiang provinces, and fail to achieve coordinated development of economic low-carbon transition among areas.\nFigure\u00a03 reflects the green technology innovation level of each area in 2006, 2013, and 2019. This paper confirms that, as a whole, the green technology innovation level is improving, and the green technology innovation capacity of each area is increasing. Moreover, it is observed by areas that the green technology innovation level varies widely among areas, and the gap is rapidly increasing. More meticulously, the green technology innovation level in the eastern area is higher than that in the central and western areas, among which the green technology innovation level in the northwest and northeast is lower and the green technology innovation level is improved at a slower pace.\nOverall, from 2006 to 2019, economic low-carbon transition and green technology innovation in all areas of China showed an upward trend. However, the\ndifferences in the level of economic low-carbon transition and green technology innovation between areas are obvious, and the high level areas of low-carbon economy and green innovation are concentrated in the eastern coast. Secondly, the speed of economic lowcarbon transition and technological innovation level improvement varies greatly among different areas, with the improvement in the eastern area much higher than that in the central and western areas, and the gap between regions has a tendency to keep expanding. Based on the visual observations in Figs.\u00a02 and 3, this paper will further analyze the impact of green technology innovation on economic low-carbon transition in Chinese provinces through an empirical model that incorporates the consideration of local government competition factors."

Therefore, the lagged one-period term of economic low-carbon transition is incorporated into the model, and Eq.\u00a0(1) is estimated using SYS-GMM model (see columns (4)-(6) in Table\u00a04). Among them, column (4) contains the results of the effect of green technology innovation on the economic low-carbon transition, column (5) contains the results of the effect of local government competition on the economic low-carbon transition, and column (6) contains the results of the effect of considering the interaction of government competition and green technology innovation on the economic low-carbon transition. Columns (1)\u2013(3) show the results of the static OLS model estimation and are included together as a reference. The results from columns (4)\u2013(6) reveal that the coefficients of the first-order lagged terms of the dependent variables are all positive and significant (p < 0.01) , which indicates a strong inertial dependence of China\u2019s economic low-carbon transition,\nwith a strong correlation between the development of low-carbon transition in the previous year. This is due to the fact that economic low-carbon transition is not a leap overnight, but a gradual accumulation. Economic low-carbon transition is a complex system that integrates economy, ecology, and society. Factors such as market barriers, industrial technological innovation, and enterprise equipment renewal have led to the need for longterm planning and gradual transition by local governments for the development of a decarbonized economy (Liu et\u00a0al. 2017).\nSecond, all the p values of AR(2) fail the significance test, i.e., the differences of the disturbance terms will not be autocorrelated of second or higher order. The Sargan test also accepts the original hypothesis that the instrumental variables are valid, thus justifying the model setting. Both columns (4) and (6) of Table\u00a04 indicate that green technology innovation has a significant facilitating effect on economic low-carbon transition, and hypothesis (1) is verified. The improvement in green technology innovation level can effectively diminish the energy consumption per unit of output, which, especially after China\u2019s stricter environmental red lines and emission standards are set, strongly motivates localities to develop\n1 3\ncorresponding green technology innovation incentives, accelerates the development and utilization of low-carbon and carbon-free energy, and promotes the low carbonization of regional energy structures (Liu et\u00a0al. 2016). Secondly, green technology innovation can strongly strengthen the research and development and promotion of low-carbon materials, products and technologies, and promote the greening of the entire product life cycle as well as the low carbonization of residents\u2019 lives, which further positively supports economic low-carbon transition (Owen et\u00a0al. 2018). Column (5) of Table\u00a04 suggests that the increase in local government competition had an insignificant effect on the economic low-carbon transition. Column (5) of Table\u00a04 suggests that the increase in local government competition had an insignificant effect on the economic low-carbon transition of the regional economy. Columns (3) and (6) of Table\u00a04 confirm that the interaction term (INTER) between local government competition and green technology innovation negatively affects economic low-carbon transition (p < 0.05) . Although the inclusion of binding ecological indicators in the assessment system of officials and the establishment of the \u201cone vote veto\u201d system for environmental assessment have driven local governments to emphasize green development and environmental protection, when faced with the choice between economic development and green technology innovation, local government officials still prefer to maintain economic development in order to achieve their own promotion due to career considerations. However, given the choice between economic development and green technology innovation, local government officials prefer to maintain economic development in order to achieve their promotion requirements. As a result, local governments may choose biased policies and invest resources in industries that are conducive to economic development, neglecting the improvement of ecological protection and social services (Wu et\u00a0al. 2020b). Moreover, there may be competition among local governments to lower environmental regulation standards to attract investment in energy-intensive industries, which will further inhibit the promotion of green technology innovation to economic low-carbon transition. Therefore, local government competition plays a negative moderating role in the impact of green\ntechnology innovation on economic low-carbon transition. Hypothesis (3) is verified."

            "text": "Table\u00a04 confirms that green technology innovation and local government competition positively contribute to economic low-carbon transition; however, whether this specific effect is linear or not needs to be tested. To further test the impact of green technology innovation and local government competition on economic low-carbon transition, the threshold regression model proposed by Hansen (1999) is utilized to further analyze green technology innovation and local government competition as threshold variables (Aye and Edoja 2017). Table\u00a05 reports the threshold effect test results, confirming that there is a significant double threshold effect of green technology innovation on economic low-carbon transition when green technology innovation is the threshold variable, while the threshold effect test results of local government competition are not significant, which implies that there is not significant nonlinear relationship between green technology innovation on economic low-carbon transition under the influence of local government competition in China at this stage.\nTables\u00a05 and 6 verify the threshold values of 3.040 and 7.480 when green technological innovation is the threshold variable, which divided the green technological innovation development level into three stages. Green technology innovation level in the first stage is lower than 3.040, and its impact coefficient on lowcarbon transition is 0.437; green technology innovation level in the second stage is greater than 3.040 but less than 7.480, at which time the impact coefficient of\nTable 5 Threshold effect test results Threshold variables Thresholds F value p value Critical value Threshold\nestimates\n0.1 0.05 0.01\nGTECH Single threshold 49.35*** 0.000 22.31 24.71 34.77 3.040 Double threshold 33.74*** 0.000 18.20 23.49 27.66 7.480\nCOMP Single threshold 11.52 0.720 30.90 37.32 48.41 3.984\n1 3\ngreen technology innovation on low-carbon transition is 0.028; and with the further improvement of green technology innovation level, it breaks through 7.480 and reaches the third stage, at which time the impact coefficient of green technology innovation on low-carbon economic transition is 0.030. From the above, it can be noted that the contribution of green technology innovation to the economic low-carbon transition has \u201cN\u201d characteristics.\nGreen technology innovation will have different degrees of impact on economic low-carbon transition at different stages of development. When reaching a certain development stage, its contribution to economic low-carbon transition slows down, and when crossing such stage, the impact of green technology innovation on economic low-carbon transition starts to increase again. This result may be due to the fact that in the initial stage of economic green transition, in order to acquire an edge in market competition, localities must increase technological transition efforts, eliminate backward production capacity, and implement policies of clean production, energy conservation, and emission reduction, which can rapidly promote the economic low-carbon transition (Yang et\u00a0al. 2022a). Once the green technology innovation reaches a certain level, the backward production capacity has been gradually eliminated. Constrained by capital, talent, and other factors, coupled with the existence of the \u201cresource curse,\u201d local governments to break away from the original development path to achieve industrial and technological upgrading will increase the cost and difficulty, thus leading to a lack of incentive for enterprise innovation, development into a bottleneck. The role of green technology innovation in promoting economic low-carbon transition has begun to diminish, and the speed of economic decarbonization has slowed down. However, with the further increase in green technology innovation, once the path dependence of development is broken, the new innovation level can trigger a \u201crecombination of production factors\u201d and a new change in production conditions, which can enable regional industries and economies to enter a new stage of low-carbon transition (Tavoni et\u00a0al. 2012). Consequently, the ability to break through the second stage of green technology innovation level is the key to further economic low-carbon transition. It can be observed through the data available in each area that the green technology innovation level of 11 provinces in China, including Qinghai, Guangxi, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Jilin, Gansu, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hainan, and Guizhou, has not yet broken through the second\nstage of development, at which time the promotion of green technology innovation to the economic low-carbon transition is relatively small, and the green technology innovation level needs to be further improved."

            "text": "The threshold model reveals that the impact of various stages of green technology innovation on economic low-carbon transition has significant differences. However, there is no threshold effect of local government competition; thus, the impact of green technology innovation on economic low-carbon transition under different government competition intensity cannot be further analyzed. In addition, Table\u00a04 confirms that local government competition inhibits the contribution of green technology innovation to economic low-carbon transition. Do the above effects work the same for all areas? If not, how does it work within different areas? To further clarify the above issues, this paper divides the studied sample into low local government competition areas and high local government competition areas based on the intensity of government competition using combining the natural interruptions. In particular, the low government competition areas are 12 provinces and cities including Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Hebei, and Chongqing, and the high local government competition areas include 18 provinces and autonomous regions including Heilongjiang, Jilin, Hebei, Shanxi, Anhui, etc. The specific categories are shown in Fig.\u00a04.\nThis section continually follows the SYS-GMM model to estimate the results (see Table\u00a07). In Table\u00a07, columns (1)\u2013(3) show the empirical results for low local government competition intensity areas, and columns (4)\u2013(6) show the empirical results for high government competition intensity areas. This paper reveals that green technology innovation contributes significantly to economic low-carbon transition in both low and high government competition areas. Local government competition inhibits the low-carbon transition, but only in low government competition intensity areas. The interaction term between local government competition and green technology innovation is significant and negative in low government competition intensity areas, but not in high government competition intensity areas. Considering that low government competition intensity areas are mainly coastal or economically developed areas, it implies that changes in local government competition intensity\n1 3\nhave a greater impact on the economic low-carbon transition in developed economic areas, while the impact on economically more backward areas is not obvious. It is evident from Fig.\u00a03 that the low government competition areas are concentrated in the three major urban clusters along the Chinese coast (BeijingTianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta) and the Chengdu-Chongqing metropolitan area, which are economically developed, densely populated, and have frequent exchanges of various factors. At the same time, the economic and social integration development among the above regions tends to be integrated, which makes green technologies often have strong spillover effects, and the benefits from cooperation between regions are much greater than those from competition (Guo et\u00a0al. 2019). Thus, in these areas, the increase of local government competition intensity will inhibit the promotion of green technology innovation for economic low-carbon transition. The areas with high local government competition intensity are the central and western areas with relatively backward economies, where local government officials are mainly faced with promotion incentives brought by economic development. In addition, these areas have prominent local fragmentation problems, so the government must strengthen the competitiveness of the region in order to continuously achieve regional economic development, which in turn may form a stronger contribution to the low-carbon economic transition. Thus, the intensity of local government competition does not have a significant inhibitory effect on the economic low-carbon transition of their economies. This finding further validates hypothesis 2."

Moreover, policymakers shall hasten to construct a green technology innovation system, thereby exerting the role of the engine of green technology to economic low-carbon transition. (2) Policymakers should also further develop the assessment system for local government officials and actively implement an effective reward and punishment mechanism to maximize the initiative of local\ngovernments and enterprises to avoid free-riding and vicious competition. Policy makers shall incorporate green technology-related contents into the political promotion system, so as to stimulate local governments to compete for the incentive to increase green technology innovation and realize economic low-carbon transition.\n(3) Differentiated policies should be implemented. Low government competition areas should continuously strengthen technological exchanges and environmental cooperation among areas and establish a joint low-carbon emission reduction system in the area. The high government competition area should reasonably guide the behavior of local governments, promote the change of competition direction among local governments, and form a benign competition for low carbon and green development. Meanwhile, high government competition areas should change the previous concept of \u201cGDP growth only\u201d and establish a certain consultation mechanism with neighbor-\n1 3\ning governments to guide resource sharing and technical cooperation, so as to avoid excessive internal consumption caused by local government competition and reduce the negative impact on economic low-carbon transition of neighboring areas.\nAlthough this paper explores the issues to be prestudied as comprehensively as possible, there are still some unavoidable limitations. First, this paper is still deficient in the construction of the index system for measuring green technology innovation and economic low-carbon transition, and the comprehensiveness of the evaluation index system can be reinforced in the subsequent research. Secondly, because of data barriers, this paper has only been able to examine the situation at the provincial level, but not at the county and city levels. Thirdly, local government competition includes economic, social, and environmental aspects, which are quantitatively represented in this paper only at the economic level and inevitably omit\nother aspects, which can be further discussed in future studies.\nAuthor contribution YX: conceptualization, project administration, writing\u2014review and editing, writing\u2014original draft.
