    "abstractText": "Security threats are always there if the human intruders are not identified and recognizedwell in time in highly security-sensitive environments like the military, airports, parliament houses, and banks. Fog computing and machine learning algorithms on Gait sequences can prove to be better for restricting intruders promptly. Gait recognition provides the ability to observe an individual unobtrusively, without any direct cooperation or interaction from the people, making it very attractive than other biometric recognition techniques. In this paper, a Fog Computing andMachine Learning Inspired Human Identity and Gender Recognition using Gait Sequences (FCML-Gait) are proposed. Internet of things (IoT) devices and video capturing sensors are used to acquire data. Frames are clustered using the affinity propagation (AP) clustering technique into several clusters, and cluster-based averaged gait image(C-AGI) feature is determined for each cluster. For training and testing of datasets, sparse reconstruction-based metric learning (SRML) and Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) with support vector machine (SVM) are applied on benchmark gait database ADSC-AWD having 80 subjects of 20 different individuals in the Fog Layer to improve the processing. The performance metrics, for instance, accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, C-time, and R-time have been measured, and a comparative evaluation of the projected method with the existing SRML technique has been provided in which the proposed FCML-Gait outperforms and attains the highest accuracy of 95.49%.",

            "text": "Jiwan Lu et al. [9] addressed the issues raised in identifying a human and recognizing gender from gait series with random walking. Most datasets assume that humans walk or move along a static route or a pre-defined pathway, which is impractical. To address this issue, a newgait dataset known as ADSC-AWD (Advanced Digital Sciences Center-Arbitrary Walking Directions) is generated in which humans walk freely and openly. Human silhouettes are extracted from each gait series and then clustered. As a feature, a C-AGI is determined for each cluster. SRML is used to differentiate gait character abstraction. They attained a rate comparable to existing gait-based gender recognition systems.\nJeevan et al. [10] developed earlier gait representations that collect both moving and looking details and are sensitive to changes in various circumstances such as bag holding and fashion style. Shannon Entropy calculates the variability in the silhouette. It understands general moving details and reacts to situations that affect appearance. Pal andPalEntropy are proposed as solutions to this problem. CASIA datasets A, B, and C were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the projected gait illustration. They obtained reasonably good\nresults on a large database, such as CASIA datasets B and C, indicating the technique\u2019s suitability for large datasets.\nArun Joshi et al. [3] used SVM and back propagation neural networks to explain an efficient and easy method for automatic human recognition from body silhouette. Just two kinds of features were obtained in this method: the length and width of the silhouette.\nXiaohui Zhao et al. [11] demonstrated a gait-based strategy for humans moving in random directions. In a broad sense, the monitor equipment\u2019s view angle in situations of the detector matter is proposed using an angle estimation scheme. The drawback of the ACM (Appearance Conversion Machine) is that good-quality exchange results are only achieved for like posture. To compensate for this drawback, modified ACM generates a better recognition outcome for distant stances.\nLopez Fernandez et al. [12] proposed a new approach for multi-view gait recognition for humans moving on uncontrolled routes. Considering the participant\u2019s mobility into account, a unique walking invariant gait representation focused on the angular evaluation of 3D objects is used. The supermajority strategy is used to enhance classifier performance. The moving gait sequences are classified using a support vector machine. The efficiency for gait recognition is demonstrated on uncontrolled routes.\nDaigo Muramatsu et al. [13] presented a gait recognition system that improves correctness in situations where views are divergent. The view transformation technique is used to generate multiple joint gait features for changing gaits. Multiple scores are computed to measure the stability of the attribute and a possibility ratio from the results. The result shows that good calibration and discrimination outcomes are achieved. However, because this strategy is considered on view challenges of gait recognition, other aspects such as clothing, possessions, and gait speed may influence the recognition rate.\nSruti Das Choudhury and TardiTjahjadi [14] proposed a gait recognition system that is unaffected by various gait identification challenges, such as unusual variability in handling and clothing.\nXin Chen et al. [15] discussed how human gait is influenced when walking with different types of individuals. A prototype referred to as a latent conditional random field is used to generate various features, and themodel is built using a support vector machine template. The results revealed that this approach outperforms for gait recognition while moving with different participants.\nDerlatka Marcin [16] described a method focused on ground reaction forces (GRF) to enhance the efficiency of gait recognition for women going in varying footwear such as high-heeled shoes and sports shoes. The expertise of moving in high-heeled shoes has a significant impact on results.\nCheng Fengjiang et al. in [17] have projected an efficient and speedy person gait recognition system. It was built with a Kinect sensor and MATLAB software in combinationwith greatmathematical computing power. They attained two innovations in this approach. The experimental outcomes showed that the system is competent for gait recognition and will be very supportive in the area of identification and security.\nMunish Kumar et al. [18] have discussed various visionbased techniques for gait recognition. In this, all the aspects related to data capturing and environmental factors influencing gait recognition are considered. SVM is used for gender recognition to provide faster responses and higher accuracy.\nMuhammad Hassan Khan et al. [19] described a method that directly works on videos instead of working on the silhouette. Spatiotemporal is used to find the local descriptors as a feature, and then, the linear SVM classifier is used. The method is applied to five different gait datasets.\nHidalgo et al. in [20] have projected a cloud-based gait analysis onmobile devices by applying theK-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) for classification and generated their dataset.\nBatool et al. in [21] have discussed an IoT-cloud-based technique for gait analysis using a machine learning technique and also effectively addressed major threats like imitation attacks. The cloud-level processing is not preferred for real-time applications as having more delay."

Nowadays, the utilization of human gait for individual identification in observation applications has magnetized researchers or inventors from computer vision [24]. The appropriateness of gait recognition or identification for observation systems emerges due to the reality that gait sequences can be obtained from the distance in addition to their non-invasive character [25].\nGait recognition is more appealing because physiological and other behavioral characteristics require human collaboration and do not produce better results in low-resolution image data.

            "text": "Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) are a confined keypoint indicator and descriptor that can be applied for item identification or certification or cataloging or 3D rebuilding [27]. It is partially motivated using the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) [28]. Typical edition of SURF is faster than SIFT and as declared by its writer to be extra strong beyond diverse image transformations than SIFT.\nSpeeded-Up Robust Features method provides finding of interest points, description feature vectors [29], and matching. Initially, Herbert Bay suggested the SURF algorithm in 2006 and is autonomous for scale and rotation [30]. It is comparable to Scale Invariant Feature Transform, however, faster than SIFT as of utilizing Integral images. SURF generates blob-like formations on the bends of items lying on the images. These blobs are found through the determinant of Hessian (DoH) matrix having altered second-order Gaussian derivative which is standardized with the discrepancy of Gaussian [30]. A native maximum is determined in whichever regions of the imagewhileGxx andGyy derivations are normally positive and Gxy is negative.\nIn the SURF detector, the DoH filter is utilized for convolving the input image. Secondly, search the local maxima among neighbor pixels, and each localmaximumpoint found is understood. Lastly, for each key point, values for x, y, and DoH are computed. The SURF descriptor\u2019s primary goal is to provide precise pixel details over the local neighborhood [30]. Since the SURF descriptor is required to recognize key point direction, pixels in its neighborhood region were convolved with lateral and vertical Haar Wavelet reactions [31]. The SURFdescriptor is applied to a region that is divided into 4\u00d7 4 subregions. These subregions are identified by wavelet estimated values as dx for horizontal and dy for vertical. The wavelet responses are then computed by sampling each subregion 5 \u00d7 5 times. The fundamental view of each subarea known as vector v is defined as v { dx, |dx|, dy, |dy|}. Concatenation 4 \u00d7 4 subareas result in 16 \u00d7 1 vector for every key point as the descriptor [31]. Integral image is utilized for getting better the processing time as calculations are performed by traversing the original image simply one time [30]. The integral image I(x) is an image in which every point p(x) (x, y)T holds the addition of every pixel of a rectangular area under consideration between 0 origin and x\npoint.\nI (x) i\u2264x\u2211\ni 0\nj\u2264y\u2211 j 0 P(x , y) (1)\nThe hessian matrix-supported detector is used to locate the key points, resulting in high accuracy and a short computing time [30]. The Hessian matrix determinant expresses the magnitude of the response. Equation (2) denotes the Hessian matrix, where m (x; y) is a key point, \u03c3 is a scale, and Dxx(m, \u03c3 ) is the Gaussian second-order derivative convolution similar to Dxy(x, \u03c3 ) and Dyy(x, \u03c3 ).\nH(m, \u03c3) { Dxx (m, \u03c3)Dxy(m, \u03c3 ) Dyx (m, \u03c3)Dyy(m, \u03c3 )\n(2)\nwhere\nDxx (m, \u03c3) I (x) \u2217 \u2202 2\n\u2202x2 h(\u03c3 ) (3)\nDxy(m, \u03c3) I (x) \u2217 \u2202 2\n\u2202xy h(\u03c3 ) (4)\nand\nh(\u03c3 ) 1 2\u03c0\u03c3 2 e\u2212 (x2+y2) 2\u03c32 (5)\nSURF technique is the speeded-up edition of SIFT, having a better encouragement in real time [31]. The recognition system\u2019s efficiency is further improved by using the fused feature vector obtained fromSURF and other techniques [32, 33]. SURF and SIFT methods are applied broadly for the recognition and tracking of objects to maximize recognition accuracy [34]."

SVM classifiers are broadly applied in bioinformatics (and other disciplines) because they are extremely correct and are capable of computing andmanipulating highdimensional data like gene expression and elasticity tomodel different data sources [36, 37]. SVM fits into the universal category of kernel schemes.\nSVMs have managed knowledge models with related learning algorithms that examine the information and are used to identify arrangements for categorization and regression investigation [38, 39]. Taking a group of training examples, everyone is considered as a member of one of the two classes, SVM training method constructs a model that allots fresh examples into one class or another. The SVM classifier is normally employed as an element of bioinformatics (and contrasting orders) due to its high accuracy and processes the high-spatial details, for example, gene interpretation [40]. SVM fits in with the universal class of portion schemes. A portion scheme is a computation that depends on the information immediately through spot items. Using SVM efficiently necessitates a comprehensive understanding of its features and functions. When organizing an SVM, the specialist may wish to settle various options as to how to pre-process the information and data, on which bits to start operating, and lastly, establishing and initializing the dimensions for support vector machines.\nSVM is based on the system risk minimization principle, which optimizes the training data set to produce machine learning models. For a training phase of instance-label pairs: (ai, bi), i 1, 2, 3\u2026\u2026, l where ai Rn and bi {1, \u2212 1}i (n and l denote the space dimensions and size of training data set).

In our data set, there are 80 different videos for \u2018a\u2019 and 20 different human values as male and female for \u2018b.\u2019\nSVM primarily focuses on determining the best hyperplane for classification by finding solutions to the quadratic optimization model shown below [39]:\nMinimise : 1\n2 || w ||2 + K\nN\u2211 i 1 \u03bei (6)\nwhere w and \u03be i represent the weight vector for learned decision hyperplane and slack variable. K is the penalty factor for balancing the classification correctness. In our approach, K is set to one. SVM categorizes the test instance, x using the decision function shown below [39]:\nf (x) sign( \u2211\nxi\u2208sv \u03b2i yi M(xi , x) + b) (7)\nwhere sv, \u03b2i ,b andM(xi, x) denote support vectors, Lagrange multipliers, model bias, and kernel function. We used linear kernel SVM in this case, soM(xi, x) equals xi \u2022 x.\nLike in this case, we intend to provide the viewer with a common overview of entire verdicts and to offer overall rules and procedures.

However, the majority of them were very timeconsuming and give low accuracy due to inefficient classifiers, fewer parameters, or performing processing at the cloud which takes more time.\nTo overcome and address the above issues, we have presented FCML-Gait, a Fog Computing andMachine Learning Inspired Human Identity and Gender Recognition Model using Gait Sequences.

Figure 2 indicates a portion of the example images of the ADSC-AWD dataset.\nIn a real-time application, the outdoor datasets are collected via IoT devices in the data acquisition layer as depicted in Fig. 3.\nThe accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, C-time, and R-time performance metrics have been measured, and relative analysis of the projected (FCML-Gait) method with the existing (SRML) technique has been performed.\nThe IoT-based gait recognition architecture is divided into four (4) distinct layers as depicted in Fig. 3. In the data acquisition layer, real-time gait sequences are captured using IoT devices or image capturing sensors. Feature vector extraction and classification using SURF, SRML and SVM are performed in the Fog layer to improve the performance and real-time alerts are generated for intruders. Decision-making like gender ratio prediction and image record storage is performed efficiently in the cloud. We can apply this model for gender base mall entry, entries in parks, and to identify the movement of humans near the line of control (LOC) and borders.\nTheworking of the FCML-Gait is explained in detail using the following working algorithm.\nFig. 5 Proposed GUI for simulation\nThe complete flow chart of the projected framework is shown in Fig. 4, where the flow is categorized as a training sequence and testing sequence.\nStep 1 Design a GUI(Graphical User Interface) for the simulation of the FCML-Gait for Human Identity and Gender Recognition from Gait Sequences where SURF, SRML, and SVM are used. The GUI for the projected approach is shown in Fig. 5. It comprises two sections, a testing section, and a training section. In the training section, a database of gait sequences for the proposed work has been uploaded for matching purposes. Training is done by using algorithms named sparse reconstruction-based metric learning (SRML) and support vector machine (SVM). SVM classifies the extracted features obtained from C-AGI and SURF.\nStep 2 Develop a code for uploading the video data for training and testing of proposed work from the ADSC-AWD database of gait. There are 80 videos for twenty different subjects four for each subject. Preprocessing on the uploaded video is applied to ensure that the video used for recognition is compatible with the proposed framework. In the pre-processing step, we have applied filtering (background subtraction), resizing, conversion (into gray and binary form), to make the uploaded video useful.\nStep 3 Clustering of the pre-processed frames using the affinity propagation (AP) technique. The code for C-AGI is also developed to act as the gait feature for every cluster. For the given gait series, suppose there are Nj frames in the jth cluster, then the feature C-AGI is computed as in Eq. (8). Figure 6a, b represents the primitive component, i.e., the cluster of frames and their average, respectively, of the uploaded video which helps in the feature extraction process where SURF is used.\nStep 4The code for SRML is developed formachine learning and a distance matrix (W) is found which is used for training and testing. SRML is applied to detect the region of the frames to be considered for feature extractions and to calculate distance metric (W). Figure 7 presents the notation of each component of the uploaded video and is marked by a red color rectangle which helps in the feature extraction process by using several components.\nStep 5 Develop a code for extracting features from the strokes using the SURF descriptor. The Extracted Features of the uploaded video as key points are shown in Fig. 8. It provides findings of interest points, description feature vectors, and matching. SURF descriptor is applied to a concerned\nregion which is splitted into 4 \u00d7 4 subregions so that maximum key features of the frame are considered. In the feature extraction technique, the way of walking such as differences in consecutive frames, the distance between hands, and style of gait cycle has been calculated. Primitive components of video frames after applying the feature extraction technique have been displayed in circles.\nStep 6 Initialize the SRML and SVM for the training of data according to feature for classification. Save Training Data and simulate with test data and find appropriate results for proposed work with a combination of SRML and SVM.\nStep 7 After the training of data, we have tested the gait video to verify the proposed work using the training dataset. In this learning, we have used the combination of SVM and SRML as a classifier to classify the test data according to the training set. Firstly, the features are trained using the SRML, after that the output of SRML acts as the input of SVM and creates a better training structure to achieve better accuracy of the proposed gait recognition system. In the classification process, both humans, as well as their gender, are recognized.\nStep 8 The performance metrics like precision, recall, F-measure, R-time, C-time, and accuracy are calculated as shown in Fig. 9 and are analyzed."

The proposedmodel is implemented on hardware that comprises a 2.4-GHzCPUand4GBRAM, and its performance will be further improved for more high-end available processors. The computational timeof the projected system is greater than the previsions existing methods as shown in Table 8, but it will not affect the performance as the trainingof the system is performedoffline andonly the testing is accomplished online efficiently as has less recognition time than the existing methods.\nThe proposed FCML-Gait approach is cost-effective as it is non-invasive and gives good results even for low-quality datasets. For its implementation minimum hardware infrastructure is required as 2.4-GHz CPU, 4 GB RAM, cameras, or IoT devices for real-time data capturing and producing good results. Further, there is parallel processing at the fog and cloud level which makes it more effective.\nA comparative analysis of the proposed work with the earlier studies is performed based on parameters, namely datasets used, algorithm/technique used, Internet of things (IoT), fog computing (FC), cloud computing (CC), accuracy/recognition rate (RR) as shown in Table 9."

This research study demonstrated a simple yet efficient fog-based technique (FCML-Gait) for personal identification and gender recognition from gait sequences. We have used SURF, SRML, and SVM at the fog layer to achieve better recognition accuracy in the real-time instance. We have extracted the feature vectors using the SURF feature descriptor, and for verification of the system, an SRML and SVM-based classifier has been used at the fog layer. The accuracy of the proposed FCMLGait-based recognition system outperforms the previous SRML and other techniques as well. The average accuracy values of different samples (for the training set having n 75%, n 50%, and n 25%) are obtained as 95.49%, 93.07%, and 92.82%, respectively, which are higher than previous (SRML) also an alert is generated for an unauthorized human. Further, in terms of recognition time which is another crucial performance metric in recognition systems, the proposed FCML-based recognition system can achieve\nTable 9 Comparative analysis of proposed work with related studies\nAuthors Dataset Algorithm/techniques IoT FC CC Accuracy/RR (%)\nSruti Das Choudhury et al.

In the cloud, records are kept for future use like decision making, prediction of gender ratio, and alert generation. Despite the benefits of the proposed system, it has some limitations as the dataset used is collected indoor, collection and use of outdoor data via IoT devices is needed. It is not implemented in real-world scenarios as having diversity in the datasets and security threats as well which are not taken into consideration. Qualitative features are not considered and have scope to improve the performance further via the concept of fused feature vectors with other advanced classifiers. In the future, we would like to address all the limitations as testing the performance of the FCML-Gait using multiple databases containing different scenarios like collected from dark, fog environment, underwater, walking in a group with different types of persons. Furthermore, we look forward to improving the performance of FCML-Gait by using advanced and more efficient feature extraction methods with fused feature concepts. Additionally, both quantitative and qualitative features can be considered in the future to strengthen the recognition technique. The proposed approach can also be used for the detection of intruders in various real-time applications, recognitions of infected humans during pandemics like COVID-19 in public places as in [43] and is not limited to humans only."
