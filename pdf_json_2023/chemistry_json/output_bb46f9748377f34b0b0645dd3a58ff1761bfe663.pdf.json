However, limited sources and the high price of lithium metal limit the application of LIBs in power grids and electric vehicles. Considering the abundant sodium sources, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have been presented as an alternative to LIBs. However, low energy density and the poor cycle life of SIBs need to be addressed for further development of SIBs.1\u20138\nCarbon materials have been reported as electrodes for SIBs owing to their good electrical conductivity, cost effectiveness, and excellent chemical and physical stability, as well as their high porosity and good cycling performance.9\u201312 Moreover, disordered carbons with larger interlayer space are benecial for Na+ insertion and extraction. Fabricating porous carbon as well as N-doping have been studied for improving the capacity and cycling performance of carbon anodes.

Centrifugal spinning allows fast and cost-effective production of nanobers and centrifugally spun nanobers show higher porosity compared to electrospun nanobers. Furthermore, porosity and pore size could be easily adjusted in this technique.19,24 Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and polystyrene (PS) are the most commonly used polymers to create pore structure in carbon bers because of their low carbon yield. These polymers decompose and create pores during high temperature carbonization processes.3,25,26 The novel morphology of N-doped carbon nanoparticles on porous carbon nanobers obtained from polypyrrole (PPy) coated centrifugally spun PAN/PMMA and PAN/PS nanobers have not been studied yet.

These blend solutions were fed into the centrifugal spinning device by a syringe pump. The rotational speed of 4000 rpm, the feeding rate of 60 ml h\u22121, the collector distance of 20 cm, and the nozzle diameter of 0.5 mm was applied in the centrifugal spinning. 10 wt% polymer blend solutions were used in the centrifugal spinning and approximately 5.7 g of nanobers produced aer an hour due to the losses of the solution during production.

Fig. 7 shows the discharge and charge curves for the rst cycles for all studied electrodes.

The large irreversible capacity in the rst cycle can be attributed to the electrolyte decomposition and formation of SEI layer.15 In the following charge discharge cycles, capacities became stable, indicating reversible intercalation/deintercalation of Na+ (Table S1 and Fig. S2\u2020). Moreover, the small plateau and large sloping capacity\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nregions indicate that a large part of the capacity was contributed by adsorption of Na+ ions into the nanopores and the reversible redox reaction between Na+ ions and functional groups, whereas a minor capacity was shared by intercalation in graphitic nanolayers as reported before for hard carbon included carbon nanober electrodes.7,31\nThe cycling performance of the electrodes at the current density of 50 mA g\u22121 was displayed in Fig. 8. The reversible capacities of around 95, 120, 190, 170, 270 and 220 mA h g\u22121 were seen from CNF, PCNF1, PCNF2, PCNF3, N-PCNF4 and NPCNF5 respectively. The higher capacities were observed from PCNFs compared to CNF and N doping further enhanced the reversible capacities up to 270 mA h g\u22121. The highest reversible capacity of around 270 mA h g\u22121 was achieved by N-PCNF 4 electrode aer 100 cycles among all studied electrodes. Enhanced capacities could be attributed to increased defects, and increased N content which well consistent with Raman and XRD results. Large amount of disordered matrix benecial for Na+ storage and large content of disordered part implies larger Na+ storage active sites thus results in higher conductivity.28 Qu et al.13 also synthesized N doped carbon ber electrodes via electrospinning and dopamine coating and enhanced reversible capacity of around 200mA h g\u22121 at 50mA h g\u22121 obtained fromN doped carbon electrodes compared to that of (around 100 mA h g\u22121) carbon electrodes. Enhanced performance was attributed to porous structure and N doping. N containing functional groups promote redox reactions and defects enhance sodium ion adsorption. Moreover, porous structure contacts better with electrolyte and shorten ion pathway as well.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 7834\u20137842 | 7839\nFig. 8 Cycling performance of CNF, PCNF1, PCNF2, PCNF3, NPCNF4 and N-PCNF5 electrodes at a current density of 50 mA g\u22121.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Moreover, good cycling performance of N-PCNF4 electrode at high current density of 1000 mA g\u22121 was also studied and the result was shown in Fig. 9a. At 1000 mA g\u22121, in 300 cycles reversible capacity was around 172 mA h g\u22121 with a high capacity retention over 88%. A high coulombic efficiency over 98% was also achieved.

The capacity retention exceeded 60% even aer 20-fold increase in current density. Furthermore, when the C rate was back to 50 mA h g\u22121, the capacity of 270 mA h g\u22121 was observed from N-PCNF4.\nThe electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra at an alternating current (AC) voltage of 5 mV amplitude in the 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz were also performed and presented in Fig. 9c. All of the studied electrodes showed semicircle arc shaped curves representing the charge-transfer resistance on electrode/ electrolyte interface and the inclined line in the low frequency region, the Warburg impedance, is associated with the sodiumion diffusion process in the electrodes. The diameter of semi circle is approximately 500 ohm for CNFs however that of is approximately 300 ohm for PCNFs. Moreover, the diameter decreased to 150 and 100 ohm for N-PCNF5 and N-PCNF4, respectively. Introducing porosity decreased the charge transfer resistance and N doping further decreased the resistance owing to larger accessible area and improved electronic conductivity with N inclusion which was proved by XPS survey. Lower resistance with N doping was also reported for carbon anodes and the result was attributed to enhanced conductivity.32\nThe best performance was seen from N-PCNF4 and this result could be ascribed to superior morphology that combine highly porous carbon nanobers and PPy based N doped carbon nanoparticles. PCNFs provide 3d interconnected highly conductive electrode structure while N doped carbon nanoparticles provide high capacity along with fast diffusion kinetics. It has been reported that N doping change the electronic state of the carbon surface and thus improve electrical conductivity of the materials. Moreover, it increases defects on the surface of the carbon materials, thereby enhancing the capacity.21 Ghani et al.7 was also studied hard carbon based electrodes and reported superior capacity with high C rate performance. In N-PCNF4, high amount of nitrogen functional groups and porous ber structure provided more active sites, enhanced electrical conductivity, and surface polarity, all led to excellent cycling performance. The excellent C rate performance of nitrogen doped carbon nanoparticle on highly porous nanober electrodes could be ascribed to novel morphology with more active sites owing to large surface area between electrodes and electrolytes, short ion diffusion distance and increased interlayer spacing which overcomes kinetic limitations. In disordered carbon electrodes, Na+ insert between carbon layers and Na+ are accommodated into mesopores. Large interlayer spacing between layers accelerates Na+ transport and storage. Moreover, N doping generate defects and form disordered carbon structure and thus further enhance Na+ absorption properties. Additional N increase electronic conductivity as well. In summary, more active sites with low charge transfer resistance, expanded interlayer spacing via N doping, large electrode electrolyte interface and short path for ions and electrons due to nanoparticle-on-nanober morphology, porous structure and N doping led to high cycling and C-rate performance.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
