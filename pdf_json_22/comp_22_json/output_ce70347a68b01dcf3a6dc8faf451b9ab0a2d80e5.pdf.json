    "abstractText": "Dalian Jinzhou Bay International Airport (DJBIA) is an offshore artificial island airport, where the reclaimed land is prone to uneven land subsidence due to filling consolidation and construction. Monitoring and predicting the subsidence are essential to assist the subsequent subsidence control and ensure the operational safety of DJBIA. However, the accurate monitoring and prediction of reclaimed subsidence for such a wide area under construction are hard and challenging. This paper utilized the Small Baseline Subset Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-InSAR) technology based on Sentinel-1 images from 2017 to 2021 to obtain the subsidence over the land reclamation area of the DJBIA, in which the results from ascending and descending orbit data were compared to verify the reliability of the results. The SBAS-InSAR results reveal that uneven subsidence is continuously occurring, especially on the runway, terminal, and building area of the airport, with the maximum subsidence rate exceeding 100 mm/year. It was found that there is a strong correlation between the subsidence rate and backfilling time. This study provides important information on the reclaimed subsidence for DJBIA and demonstrates a novel method for reclaimed subsidence monitoring and prediction by integrating the advanced InSAR technology and Terzaghi Consolidation Theory modeling. Moreover, based on the Terzaghi consolidation theory and the corresponding geological parameters of the airport, predicted subsidence curves in this area are derived. The comparison between predicted curves and the actual subsidence revealed by InSAR in 2017\u20132021 is highly consistent, with a similar trend and falling in a range of \u00b125 mm/year, which verifies that the subsidence in this area conforms to Terzaghi Consolidation Theory. Therefore, it can be predicted that in the future, the subsidence rate of the new reclamation area in this region will reach about 80 mm/year \u00b1 25 mm/year, and the subsidence rate will gradually slow down with the accumulation of reclamation time. The subsidence rate will slow down to about 30 mm/year \u00b1 25 mm/year after 10 years.",

Land reclamation is prone to unstable geological foundations due to sediment consolidation [1\u20134]. Airports built on reclaimed land commonly suffer from land subsidence, which will threaten the operational safety of the airport, especially the land subsidence occurring in runway areas [5]. Therefore, it is essential to monitor and\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 2332. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14102332 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 2332 2 of 16\npredict the ground subsidence in this area and assess its impact on the safe operation of the airport. Reliable surface deformation information can be obtained through traditional pointmeasurement methods, such as level surveys or global satellite navigation and positioning technology. However, traditional measurement methods was difficult to apply them to ground subsidence monitoring at airports under reclamation. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is an emerging geodetic technology. It is capable of acquiring highaccuracy and continuously covered surface deformation information, which is widely used in the fields of ground subsidence monitoring [1,3,6,7], and landslide monitoring [8\u201312]. In recent years, InSAR technology has been widely used in land subsidence monitoring at airports. Such as Hong Kong Chek Lap Kok Airport [13,14], Shanghai Pudong International Airport [15,16], Beijing Capital International Airport [17,18], Shenzhen Baoan International Airport [19,20], Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Malaysia [5], and Japanese airports [21\u201323]. The land formed by the land reclamation airport is characterized by high compressibility, low strength, and a large porosity ratio, which easily leads to ground subsidence. Studies related to reclaimed land airport monitoring by InSAR have been performed. Lu et al. [19] and Xu et al. [24] monitored ground subsidence at Shenzhen Baoan International Airport based on the SAR data from 2007 to 2010 and 2015 to 2019, revealing that the subsidence in the reclamation area was greater than in the ground, and dynamic loads is an important factor that causing airport subsidence. Zhuo et al. [25] conducted subsidence monitoring of Xiamen Xiang\u2019an New Airport based on SBAS-InSAR from 2018 to 2020 and identified the areas that may be affected in the future based on the type of airport land use. Hong Kong Chek Lap Kok Airport [14] and Xiamen New Airport [26] used SAR data and geological data combined with Terzaghi consolidation theory for long-term subsidence monitoring of the reclamation airports. The above studies used InSAR observation on reclaimed airport subsidence monitoring and made a detailed analysis of subsidence. Integration of InSAR observation and geological condition of the artificial land area to predict the subsidence trend deserves further study. In this paper, SBAS-InSAR was used to monitor the land subsidence at DJBIA based on 50 Sentinel-1A ascending SAR images between March 2017 and April 2021. The SABSInSAR monitoring results reveal the regional distribution and time\u2013series characteristics of airport subsidence. Based on the Terzaghi consolidation theory, the geological data of the airport were used to calculate the deformation of the soil layer at any time during the land reclamation process and to predict the subsidence development trend. The InSAR results verified that the subsidence in 2017\u20132021 is consistent with the predicted curve of the Terzaghi consolidation theory in the area. The integration of InSAR observation and Terzaghi Consolidation Theory works well in this area and could make a great contribution to the subsidence prediction."

The hills are northeast-southwest direction, with relatively flat terrain on the east and west sides [27]. The study area, DJBIA, is in the sea area of Jinzhou Bay, Dalian City. DJBIA is an offshore artificial island airport on the Chinese mainland, which consists of berms, the runway, and the building area (Figure 1). The western bay of Jinzhou District, where the airport is located, belongs to the high-risk area for geological disasters [28]. DJBIA can serve an average annual passenger throughput of 43 million and 550,000 tons of cargo and mail [29]. Its construction aims to effectively alleviate the tight operating resources and over-saturation of throughput at Dalian Zhoushuizi International Airport, and provide strong support for economic and social development and comprehensive transportation construction in Dalian. DJBIA has a total planned area of 20.87 km2, including a terminal area of 500,000 m2, with two 3600 m long teleparallel runways, 45 m, and 60 m\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 2332 3 of 16\nwide, respectively [29]. The airport started to fill the land from the beginning of 2010. To better analyze the characteristics of subsidence, the reclaimed area from 2010 to 2021 was defined as six reclamation stages with a period of every two years. The spatial distribution of the reclamation area and reclamation area in different stages is shown in Figure 2a. The road to the airport has been completed in 2011, the building area and part of the terminal in 2013, all of the terminal and part of the heliport filled in 2015, and the focus on the runway and building area filled from 2017 to 2021. As shown in Figure 2b, the largest increase in filled area was 4.96 km2 in 2015 and the accumulation of filled area will reach 11.29 km2 by April 2021.

Data Source\nIn this paper, 50 images of Sentinel-1A ascending orbit and 15 images of Sentinel-1B descending orbit from the European Space Agency (ESA) were acquired to monitor ground subsidence at DJBIA. The main obtained include orbit, resolution, polarization mode, and other parameter information, other detailed parameter information, as shown in Table 1. The 30 m resolution SRTM DEM data provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was used in the data processing, to remove the topographic phase. It is worth noting that the study area in this paper is a new reclamation area, and the airport area does not have the latest DEM in the SRTM data or other data. Considering that the entire area is relatively flat (the fluctuation is within 5 m) and the spatial baseline of the sentinel data is controlled within 100 m, the effect of elevation residuals on the deformation of relatively flat terrain in this case of short vertical baseline interference pairs can be neglected. Based on the 50 ascending images, a temporal baseline threshold of 100 days and a spatial baseline threshold of 221 m were set, and 132 pairs of interference pairs were generated by the combination (Figure 3).

            "text": "In 2002, Berardino et al. proposed SBAS-InSAR as a novel technology with great prospects for application in the field of monitoring ground subsidence over long-term time series [33,34]. The technology has better applicability and reliability in areas of changing ground cover because it can reduce the negative effects of incoherence and DEM errors. To detect ground subsidence at the airport, the paper used the SBAS plug-in in ENVI software for step-by-step calculation. It includes three main steps: data pre-processing, interferogram generation, and deformation result generation.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 2332 7 of 16\nThe detailed steps of SBAS-InSAR technology are as follows: Assuming that there are N +1 SAR images covering the same area acquired according\nto the time series, the image acquisition time series is:\nt = [t0, . . . , tN ] T (1)\nAfter selecting one of them as the master image for registration, in all the free combinations of differential interferometric pairs selected to meet the time baseline and spatial baseline thresholds, M differential interferograms can be obtained, then there are:\nN + 1 2 \u2264 M \u2264 N\n( N + 1\n2\n) (2)\nCombined with the orbit data and external digital elevation model data to remove the flat and terrain effects. The noise is effectively removed by multi-viewing and filtering. In order to obtain the accumulation of deformation on the radar LOS (Line of Sight, LOS), the minimum cost flow (MCF) method is used to perform phase unwinding of M interferometric pairs [35,36]. Suppose that the jth differential interferogram is generated by acquiring the SAR image from the moment of image tA and the main image tB, then the corresponding phase unwrapping at any pixel point in the jth interferogram can be expressed as:\n\u03b4\u03d5j = \u03d5(tB)\u2212 \u03d5(tA) \u2248 \u03b4\u03d5 j de f + \u03b4\u03d5 j topo + \u03b4\u03d5 j atm + \u03b4\u03d5 j noise (3)\nwhere \u03b4\u03d5j is the interference phase at the point; \u03d5(tA) and \u03d5(tB) are the phase values at tA and tB moments, respectively, with respect to the initial moment t0; \u03b4\u03d5 j de f , \u03b4\u03d5 j topo, \u03b4\u03d5 j atm , \u03b4\u03d5 j noise indicate the phase difference caused by deformation phase (along with the radar LOS), terrain error, atmospheric delay, and noise, respectively. In order to enhance the accuracy of the deformation monitoring results in the study area, these error terms need to be effectively estimated and eliminated. Firstly, by selecting more uniform Ground Control Points (Ground Control Points, GCPs) for orbit refinement and re-flattening, not only the orbit parameters can be corrected, but also the residual phase and phase jumps can be estimated and removed [37]. Then, the residual elevation and deformation rate are estimated based on the linear model, and the wrapping phase will be unwrapped twice [38]. Finally, the atmospheric phase is removed by spatial high-pass filtering and temporal low-pass filtering [39]. After removing the above error phase components, the time series deformation information in the LOS direction is obtained by the SVD method. Due to SAR radar satellite side-view imaging, LOS displacement as a component of real displacement can be acquired [24]. When the horizontal displacement is much smaller than the vertical component, the LOS direction displacement is dominated by vertical subsidence [24,25,40]. As the airport region is relative flat and not like the mountainous area in the InSAR processing, based on the imaging geometry relationship, dlos can be converted to ground subsidence du based on the incidence angle \u03b8 [41], as in Equation (4):\ndu = dlos/ cos \u03b8 (4)\nwhere du is the vertical displacement component; dlos is the LOS displacement; \u03b8 is the radar incidence angle."

To find the deformation of the saturated soil layer at any time during infiltration consolidation, the Terzaghi consolidation theory can be established to solve the problem. The Terzaghi theory of consolidation makes many simplifications and assumptions about the changing parameter conditions of the soil during consolidation. Firstly, the external load is applied to the soil instantaneously and at once, and remains constant throughout the consolidation process. Secondly, the soil and water do not produce compression deformation, and the soil compression is caused by drainage. Finally, parameters such as permeability coefficient \u03b1 and compression coefficient \u03b2 of the soil during consolidation remain constant during consolidation [30]. In this paper, based on the basic assumptions of the conventional Terzaghi consolidation theory, a differential unit soil body with a height of dh in the soil body is taken for analysis. The volume compression of the soil is equal to the difference between the inflow and outflow of water from the unit body, which is used to establish the consolidation differential equilibrium equation. Additionally, used Darcy\u2019s law and the effective stress principle to solve the equation and obtained the differential equation of Terzaghi consolidation theory [43,44]. As shown in Equation (5):\nC \u22022Pw \u2202h2 = \u2202Pw \u2202t\n(5)\nwhere C is the coefficient of consolidation (m2/year); Pw is pore water pressure (kPa); The coefficient of consolidation C and the degree of time consolidation Dc of the soil can be expressed by Equations (6) and (7):\nC = \u03b1 1 + k0 \u03b2Gw\n(6)\nDc = 1\u2212 8e\u2212\n\u03c02C 4H2\n\u03c02 (7)\nwhere \u03b1 is the permeability coefficient (m/year); k0 is the initial porosity ratio; \u03b2 is the compression coefficient (kPa\u22121); Gw is the water gravity (kN/m3) and H is the maximum drainage distance (m). Determining and deriving the relevant parameters can calculate any time soil consolidation subsidence St(m) [45]. As shown in Equation (8):\nSt = Dc \u03b2\n1 + k0 \u03b3H (8)\nwhere \u03b3 is the Solidification Stress (kPa). After obtaining the subsidence prediction curves according to the above calculation method and geological parameters, they were compared with the ground subsidence results monitored by SBAS-InSAR technology. Finally, the curves were used to predict the rate and trend of subsidence in the study area."

Figure 7b\u2013e shows the coherence coefficient, differential interferogram, distribution of elevation residuals, and the error map in the time-series processing, respectively. It can be seen that the area has a high coherence coefficient, a clear interferogram, and small residuals in the time series analysis (maximum less than 4 mm/year). Since the study area is under long-term construction and exploitation, special consideration needs to be given to the possible errors due to inaccurate\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 2332 9 of 16\nexternal elevation information. According to the demand of the landfill here, the elevation error is about 10 m. Based on the results of related studies [46] and the better baseline control of the sentinel data (all vertical baselines are less than 150 m), it is projected that this part of the elevation error will cause the deformation measurement error of interference pair to be less than 2 mm and can be further weakened during the time-series analysis. The inversion results of the elevation residuals in Figure 7d also shows that the elevation residuals of the airport building area, terminal, and heliport are small (between 0.3 and 3 m). Therefore, the measurement errors caused by elevation errors can be controlled. In addition, we introduced the descending orbit data for the same period (December 2019 to April 2021), where the descending orbit data are missing from June-November 2019. It can be found that the deformation results are highly consistent with the ascending orbit results regarding the spatial distribution (Figure 7a). In the runway end area, the number of effective monitoring points becomes more as the backfill progresses, and there is a partial normal decrease in the deformation magnitude. The comparison of the time-series residual results with the ascending and descending orbit results in Figure 6e confirms that the InSAR results of this study are reliable. In summary, the InSAR monitoring results have high accuracy. Because of the lack of data from the descending orbit, the results of the ascending orbit were used for subsequent analysis to ensure data integrity. Since the study area is dominated by vertical ground deformation with minimal horizontal deformation, the absence of horizontal deformation is assumed here to approximate the ascending orbit deformation results to ground subsidence, which is convenient for subsequent 5-year long time series analysis and model building.

From the vertical subsidence results in Figure 6a after ascending orbit decomposition, it can be seen that during the monitoring period from March 2017 to April 2021, some areas of the airport, such as the runway, terminal, and heliport areas of the airport are in a severe subsidence. It is revealed from the combination of Figures 6a and 8 that the accumulation of subsidence in the terminal was over 300 mm and the maximum vertical subsidence rate reached \u2212160 mm/year. Moreover, the time series of subsidence areas in Figure 8 was near linear in the short term, but the subsidence rate was highly associated with the backfilling time, i.e., the longer the reclaimed time, the lower the subsidence rate.

The prediction based on the current stage can generally identify the subsidence rate and trend in the study area, which is important for the control of the current and future construction. The main findings of this paper are listed in the following. (1) Extensive and significant uneven ground subsidence is occurring throughout the land reclamation area of the airport, especially in the runway, terminal, and building areas, with the maximum subsidence rate exceeding \u2212100 mm/year. By analyzing the maximum subsidence rate in four typical areas and the average regional subsidence rate in six different reclamation periods, it shows that there is a large connection between the ground subsidence rate and the reclamation time in this area, which means that the earlier the reclamation completion, the larger the subsidence rate. (2) Based on Terzaghi consolidation theory and on-site geological parameters, a predicted subsidence rate curve was derived for the area, which was in high agreement with the InSAR monitored subsidence results in 2017\u20132021, verifying the applicability of the proposed prediction model based on Terzaghi consolidation theory for this land reclamation airport. (3) The prediction model reveals that subsidence in the entire reclamation area is in a relatively significant and rapid stage at this stage, and the overall subsidence rate of the reclamation area will be decreasing dramatically as time goes by. The subsidence in the newly reclaimed area in the first two years is within the range of 80 \u00b1 25 mm/year, and it will slow down to about 30 \u00b1 25mm/year after 10 years.\nAuthor Contributions: X.S. and C.C. implemented a combination of both methods.
