    "abstractText": "Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are well known for their ability to adsorb various gases. The use of MOFs for the storage and release of biologically active gases, particularly nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO), has been a subject of interest. To elucidate the binding mechanisms and geometry of these gases, an in situ single crystal X-ray diffraction (scXRD) study using synchrotron radiation at Diamond Light Source has been performed on a set of MOFs that display promising gas adsorption properties. NO and CO, were introduced into activated Ni-CPO-27 and the related Co-4,6-dihydroxyisophthalate (Co-4,6-dhip). Both MOFs show strong binding affinity towards CO and NO, however CO suffers more from competitive co-adsorption of water. Additionally, we show that morphology can play an important role in the ease of dehydration for these two systems. https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-023-00845-1 OPEN",

Their structures consist of metal nodes or oxoclusters bound by organic linkers to create large open lattice frameworks2. MOFs are well known for their high porosities and exceptional gas adsorption properties, due to their tuneable node chemistry and exceptionally high specific surface areas3,4.\nCPO-275, also referred to as MOF-746, is a well-studied and widely used MOF comprising M2+ metal ions, where M can be a wide range of metals such as Mg, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn, linked by 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalate (2,5-dhtp) linkers7\u20139. It crystallises in the R-3 space group and consists of hexagonal channels running along the crystallographic c-axis. These channels contain open metal sites upon removal of covalently bound water molecules, as such CPO-27 is an attractive option for the storage of gases, particularly Lewis acids such as CO and NO. A structural conformer of CPO-27, M2(m-dobdc) where M is Co can be obtained by using the linker 4,6-dihydroxyisophthalic acid (4,6-dhip, an isomer of 2,5-dhtp)10. We refer to this material as Co-4,6-dhip in the rest of this paper. The isomeric linker commands a slightly altered short range structure in the metal node, which results in minutely distorted hexagonal channels and a different space group (R3m), but otherwise almost identical structural features (pore chemistry, and available open metal sites).\nGas storage and sequestration is amongst the most exciting and well researched areas of MOFs. The adsorption of relevant gases for energy production, e.g. H211 and CH412, the storage of pollutants such as CO213, SOx14 and NOx15 have received much attention in recent years. However, the exact binding mechanisms of these gases often remain elusive. Another avenue is the storage and release of biologically active gases. There has been significant research into using MOFs to store and release NO1,7,16\u201323. NO is an important signalling molecule in mammalian physiology, serving a vital function in various systems throughout the body24. In high concentrations NO is toxic, but in low concentrations NO may be used in medical technologies1,25,26. MOFs such as CPO27 have shown great potential in storing NO and the subsequent controlled release in the presence of water1. However, NO is not the only gas capable of performing this function and CPO-27 not the only MOF. Gases such as CO also have medical uses, and MOFs such as BioMIL-316, Co-4,6-dhip and a variety of zeolites have also been studied27,28.\nTo fully understand the uptake and release thermodynamics it is important to know exactly how the gases bind within the frameworks. Single crystal X-ray diffraction (scXRD) provides invaluable understanding of the binding motif in these materials. By using the high intensity and high energy X-rays available at a synchrotron29, it is possible to obtain, and model, data of high enough resolution to observe gas molecules within the MOF pore environment. We have previously published data on NO binding in Ni-CPO-2730. In this study we investigate the binding mechanism of CO and NO in Ni-CPO-27 and for the first time of its structural conformer MOF Co-4,6-dhip. An efficient activation protocol is determined and the MOF gas adsorption properties towards CO and NO are probed as previous work showed a reduced release of NO in the Co/Ni-4,6-dhip framework, while other works have disclosed a higher affinity of this framework toward H210,31, when compared to CPO-27."

Samples were considered activated when the M\u2014Owater\n(Ow) oxygen residual occupancy fell below 10%. However, complete activation, i.e., a residual occupancy of Ow ~0% could not be achieved even after treatment under high vacuum and temperature; a similar behaviour was also observed in a previous study30. There are several possible reasons for this. Some residual water may be trapped in blocked one-dimensional channels on surface contact of the crystal with the glue used to hold it in place. It was also found that if the activated samples were cooled, the amount of bound water increased even under (dynamic) vacuum. This suggests that, because the whole gas delivery system cannot be heated, some water remains bound on the cool surfaces of the gas system even when the crystal itself is heated and this water is readsorbed once the crystal is cooled. Previous studies on other MOFs have successfully achieved complete dehydration32, however the high number of open metal sites in these frameworks makes this more challenging to achieve. To mitigate this to some degree (but not completely), the crystal was exposed to the gases of interest while it was still at the dehydration temperature. However, a small amount of residual water will remain on gas uptake. The samples were then cooled to 300 K to observe how the gas binding changes and to gain better quality data. Presented here are the obtained structures. A list of experimental details with corresponding refinement quality factors (R1) can be found in supplementary table 1 and the full structure determination details have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystal Structure Database as described below.\nAnalysis on bulk samples of Ni-CPO-27 and Co-4,6-dhip can be found within the Supplementary Information. More detailed information on the two MOFs used in this study can be found in the publication by Vornholt et al. which also includes a number of different gas adsorption isotherms for the two systems30."

            "text": "Activation. In a first gas loading experiment, the uptake of CO in Ni-CPO-27, the crystal was first activated at 450 K for 5 h in vacuo. The activated structure is shown in Fig. 1 and supplementary data 6, where the framework shows the expected R-3 space group and characteristic hexagonal channels seen in NiCPO-2730. Ow shows an occupancy of 6.06(2)%, the framework is therefore considered activated.\nGas loading. CO was introduced to the crystal at 450 K at an absolute pressure of 2.5 bar. Figure 1, and Supplementary Data 3, shows that CO has chemisorbed onto the vacant metal site, via the C atom with a linear geometry and 38(3)% partial occupancy. The CO bond length is 1.17(7) \u00c5, within error of the 1.13 \u00c5 bond length computed for molecular CO33. The Ni\u2014C bond length is 2.16(3) \u00c5, longer than has been recorded spectroscopically on Ni surfaces34, but of the same order as that found for Co-CPO-27 at lower temperature19. The Ni-C-O angle is 176.388\u00b0 approximately linear binding. As shown and discussed later in more detail (Fig. 2), the CO appears to be disordered. Enlarged atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) will be a result of the atomic displacement at the high temperature at which the dataset was recorded. Additionally, despite the structure being deemed activated any disorder between the CO and residual water bound to the metal site may artificially elongate the modelled Ni-C bond and enlarge obtained ADPs for the guest. However, a sensible refinement of multiple oxygen position to resolve any such disorder was not successful for this dataset.\nReducing the temperature to 300 K with the same CO pressure has two effects visualized in Fig. 1 and seen in supplementary data 7. Firstly, the CO loading increases to 63(4)%. With this, the CO bond at 1.16(4) \u00c5 is within the error of that from the 450 K structure, the Ni\u2014C bond is also similar at 2.12(4) \u00c5 and the Ni-\n2 COMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY | (2023) 6:44 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-023-00845-1 | www.nature.com/commschem\nC-O bond angle changes to 168.6\u00b0. Secondly, some competing water also binds to the open metal site with 27(3)% loading and a Ni\u2014Ow bond length of 2.16(7) \u00c5. A similar effect was seen with NO in Ni-CPO-2730. This is not unexcepted nor undesirable as the competition between water and NO is what allows controlled release17. A reduction in CO bond length on cooling was expected, as Long and co-workers found spectroscopically that CO in Ni-CPO-27 was adsorbed non-classically and was blue shifted on binding35. However, the presence of water in the model make such variations hard to uncover unambiguously. In addition, the modelled water is likely the main cause of the deviation in Ni-CO bond angle, as modelling the water and CO from the same region of electronic density causes the C to be slightly displaced. Therefore, it is probable that the CO still prefers the linear geometry seen at higher temperatures. The CO molecule was less disordered at 300 K than at higher temperature and yielded a model with only one site (Fig. 2).\nPhysisorbed CO in Ni-CPO-27. It was not possible to sensibly refine any physisorbed gas molecules. However, by calculating a mask with a 1.2 \u00c5 probe it was possible to estimate the open pore volume and the amount of e\u2212 density remaining within the pores, a useful proxy for the amount of gas molecules present in the pore. The activated sample had a free pore volume of 2097 \u00c53 per unit cell. Upon loading with CO this reduced to 1782 \u00c53 per unit cell, and cooling reduced it slightly to 1770 \u00c53 per unit cell, this is approximately 75% of the total, theoretical, dehydrated pore size. The e- density in the pore of the activated sample was estimated at 0.147 e\u2212 per \u00c53. Loading with CO increased this to 0.535 e\u2212per \u00c53 and cooling slightly reduced it to 0.531 e\u2212 per \u00c53. This is the expected pattern as introducing CO into the pores will increase the e\u2212 density, cooling increases the amount of CO chemisorbed\nso there is now less free in the pore. From these values it can be estimated that there are roughly 48 CO molecules per unit cell tumbling freely within the pore at 2.5 bar pressure and 300 K."

            "text": "Activation. Following the CO loading of Ni-CPO-27, CO loading of Co-4,6-dhip was performed to identify any differences between the two systems. Dehydration of a Co-4,6-dhip crystal was more complex than the Ni-CPO-27 sample, involving prolonged treatment at 450 K followed by a slow ramp over 10 h up to 500 K and holding at temperature for 1.5 h in vacuo. This was followed by flushing the sample with CO at 2.5 bar and then removing it in vacuo (Fig. S3). Figure 3 and Supplementary Data 2 shows the resulting activated Co-4,6-dhip with the expected R3m symmetry10. The Ow occupancy on the Co was 9.0(4)%, higher than that achieved for the dehydration of Ni-CPO-27. The significant difference in dehydration conditions required is likely due to the differences in morphology, as one might expect Ni to be harder to dehydrate due to its higher hydration enthalpy36, as well as the very similar thermal gravimetric analysis profiles of the two MOFs between 300 and 470 K (Fig. S4). Co-4,6-dhip crystallizes in long needles, whereas Ni-CPO-27 forms broader hexagonal rods (Fig. S5)30. If the hexagonal channels run down the length of the Co-4,6-dhip needle then the available surface area from which to lose water will be significantly reduced, therefore making dehydration harder.\nGas loading. CO was introduced to the crystal at 500 K and 2.5 bar. This caused CO to be chemisorbed to the open cobalt site, via the C atom; however, it also introduced water, as seen in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 1. This caused the CO loading to be\nCOMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY | (2023) 6:44 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-023-00845-1 | www.nature.com/commschem 3\nonly 10.7(15)% with 15.2(15)% water loading. The CO bond length is 1.13(3) \u00c5, the Co\u2014C bond length is 2.26(4) \u00c5 and the Co-C-O bond angle is 151.747\u00b0. The Co\u2014Ow bond length is 2.22(2) \u00c5. The increase in Co\u2014CO bond length and deviation in bond angle may be due to a weaker bond but the higher temperature and large proportion of water will affect these values significantly and further spectroscopy is needed to verify any changes. Again, the CO is highly disordered, and it was not possible to model sensibly as highlighted in Fig. 2. This binding behavior corresponds with results obtained by Long and coworkers who found similar bond lengths and geometry at lower temperatures in Co-CPO-2737. Upon cooling the sample, a black residue formed on the outer wall of the gas cell and no further data could be gathered.\nPhysisorbed CO in Co-4,6-dhip. It was not possible to sensibly refine any physisorbed CO molecules. However, by calculating a mask with a 1.2 \u00c5 probe it was possible to estimate the open pore volume and the amount of e\u2212 density within the pores. The activated sample had a pore volume of 2061 \u00c53 per unit cell and e\u2212 density of 0.568 e\u2212 per \u00c53, higher than expected under the conditions. On loading the sample, the pore volume changed to 1830 \u00c53 per unit cell and the e- density to 0.644 e\u2212 per \u00c53. The free pore volume calculated here is approximately 78% of the total, theoretical, dehydrated pore volume. The high e\u2212 densities may be explained by disorder within the crystal structure, or even framework decomposition, placing apparent e- density within the pores. Due to the high e- density of the activated sample an accurate measure of the number of physisorbed gas molecules is not possible."

Lastly, NO loading of the Co-4,6-dhip system was studied, allowing a direct comparison of the binding of different gases in this system and any changes of the NO binding in Co4,6-dhip compared to Ni-CPO-2730. This crystal activated more easily than the previous, with a max temperature of only 450 K in vacuo required with no need for gas flushing. A possible explanation for this is the position of the glue relative to the crystal. The previous sample had glue at one end of the needle, whereas this sample had the glue in the middle. Since the hexagonal channels run down the length of the needle it would explain the difference in dehydration conditions needed for the same structure as more pores are blocked when the crystal is mounted end on. It is also possible that this difference is due to slight structural variations between the crystals. The residual occupancy of Ow was 7.7(4)% (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Data 5), and the crystal structure was as expected and discussed above.\nGas loading. Loading NO at 450 K and 2.5 bar, caused NO to become chemisorbed to the open metal site, via the N atom, with 84.5(15)% loading (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Data 8).

To maintain a sensible geometry the refinement included restraints on the N-O bonds as additional observations which resulted in N-O distances that ranged from 1.12(2)\u20131.15(2) \u00c5. The unrestrained Co\u2014N bond length was 1.972(10) \u00c5. The NO binds in a bent geometry; again this was also seen with Ni-CPO2730.\nCooling the sample to 300 K under the same NO pressure caused an increase in NO loading to 92(3)% (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Data 4). The O atom was again disordered and was modelled with four O environments around the N. This reduction in disorder may be down to the reduction in temperature, as seen previously30. Unfortunately, this data set is weaker due to increased background noise, likely caused competition at lower temperature with diffraction from the gas cell capillary (Fig. 4e). The N-O interatomic distance was restrained in the same manner as above and resulted in refined distances that ranged from 1.11(2)\u20131.14(3) \u00c5. The Co\u2014N bond length was 1.960(11) \u00c5, within error of the higher temperature sample. The NO still prefers the bent geometry.\nPhysisorbed NO in Co-4,6-dhip. Again, modelling physisorbed NO was not possible but the mask calculated with a 1.2 \u00c5 probe estimated the following parameters. The activated sample had a pore volume of 2061 \u00c53 per unit cell which decreased to 1434 \u00c53 per unit cell when NO was added and decreased further to 1425 \u00c53 per unit cell on cooling. This is approximately 60% of the total, theoretical, dehydrated pore volume. The e\u2212 density in the pore was again surprisingly high for the activated sample at 0.578 e\u2212per \u00c53, it increased to 0.785 e\u2212 per \u00c53 when NO was added and dropped to 0.648 e\u2212 per \u00c53 on cooling. See above for explanation of high e\u2212 densities."

            "text": "We have verified that Ni-CPO-27 can be activated successfully at 450 K under high vacuum. Co-4,6-dhip can be more difficult to\nactivate, possibly due to its needle like morphology, restricting the rate of water loss from the internal channels. For the first time we show that NO can bind in Co-4,6-dhip successfully and shows many similar characteristics to how it binds within Ni-CPO-2730. CO can also bind at the open metal site of both Ni-CPO-27 and Co-4,6-dhip. The CO bond remains similar to molecular CO suggesting that the metal binding involves very little redistribution of e\u2212 density. CO also prefers binding in a linear geometry compared to NO which prefers a bent geometry. These bonding characteristics match well with the traditional orbital bonding model of CO and NO38. This work further elucidates the importance of high quality, in situ, scXRD experiments to understand not only how gases bind within molecules; but how subtle changes to linker and metal nodes can affect this binding. Having high quality CIF files as definitive structure solution of guest-loaded MOFs is an invaluable for further analysis such as computational modelling that relies on exact bond distances. It is important to note how the relative competition between an adsorbed gas molecule and water can impact on potential utility of a material, especially for biological gases such as NO and CO. The more significant competition between CO and H2O that has been revealed by this work will have an effect on how a COloaded MOF will behave under physiological (aqueous) conditions. This in itself indicates the importance of undertaking complex and advanced characterisation experiments to understand these interactions more thoroughly."

Pink single crystals were obtained after filtration (70% yield based on Co).\nPhase purity was verified by powder X-ray diffraction, Figs.

In-situ gas cell diffraction experiment on single crystals were carried out on the four-circle Newport diffractometer equipped with a Dectris Pilatus 300 K detector in I19-2 beamline, Diamond Light Source. A wavelength of 0.48590 \u00c5 (Ag K-edge) was utilized to give a complete dataset from a single 340 degree phi sweep (1700 images, 0.2 deg/image). Selected crystals were mounted with a mitogen mount (50 \u00b5m) and were secured with a non-diffracting two component epoxy glue (LOCKTITE DOUBLE BUBBLE\u2122). Care was taken to use as little glue as possible to avoid blocking any channels and ensure good gas transport through the crystal. For gas cell experiments, the crystal mount was inserted into a pre-assembled gas cell, with super glue used to hold the mount securely in place in the gas cell capillary. The gas cell was then sealed using the Swagelok mechanism and leak tested. The activation temperature ranged from 450\u2013500 K, with a heating ramp of 360 K/h, in vacuo (3.1 \u00d7 10\u22126 mbar at the pump). A data collection at 300 K of the activated systems was obtained for comparison purposes. Activated crystals were exposed to 2.5 bar of the selected gas (CO or NO) at 450\u2013500 K and data collected after 30 min exposure. The sample was then cooled to 300 K at the same gas pressure and another data set collected. After the crystal had been exposed to the gas for another 30 min, an additional dataset was obtained to monitor gas uptake.\nData processing.
