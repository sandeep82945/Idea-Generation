1. **Investigate the relationship between gut microbiota composition and ACSCR:** 
Explore whether specific gut microbiota profiles are associated with an increased risk of developing ACSCR. This could involve conducting microbiome analysis in ACSCR patients and comparing it to healthy controls.


2. **Examine the effects of dietary interventions on TMAO, PNX, ALA, and SPX levels in ACSCR patients:** 
Determine if dietary modifications, such as reducing choline and L-carnitine intake or consuming prebiotics and probiotics, can influence the levels of these molecules and potentially improve ACSCR symptoms.


3. **Evaluate the potential of TMAO, PNX, ALA, and SPX as biomarkers for ACSCR diagnosis and monitoring:** 
Investigate whether these molecules can be used to differentiate ACSCR patients from healthy individuals and to assess disease severity or treatment response.


4. **Study the role of TMAO, PNX, ALA, and SPX in the pathogenesis of ACSCR:** 
Conduct in vitro and animal studies to elucidate the mechanisms by which these molecules contribute to the development and progression of ACSCR. This could involve examining their effects on retinal pigment epithelium cells, choroidal blood flow, and inflammation.


5. **Develop therapeutic strategies targeting TMAO, PNX, ALA, and SPX for ACSCR treatment:** 
Explore the potential of modulating these molecules through pharmacological interventions or lifestyle modifications to improve ACSCR outcomes. This could involve developing inhibitors of TMAO production, PNX mimetics, ALA analogs, or SPX agonists.
