 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct randomized controlled trials comparing intratumoral immunotherapy to standard systemic immunotherapy for various cancers. This will help determine the optimal route of administration and dosing for immunotherapies.

2. Develop new drug delivery methods and formulations to enhance penetration and distribution of drugs administered regionally, such as nanoparticles or liposomes optimized for intraperitoneal delivery.

3. Identify predictive biomarkers to select patients most likely to benefit from regional drug delivery methods like HIPEC or PIPAC. This can improve patient outcomes and avoid toxicity in non-responders. 

4. Test novel combinations of regional chemotherapy with immunotherapy or other systemic agents. Combined regional and systemic therapy may provide synergistic effects.

5. Further explore emerging preclinical strategies like intrathoracic administration via the thoracic duct. If effective, translate these methods to clinical trials for cancers like abdominal lymph node metastases.
