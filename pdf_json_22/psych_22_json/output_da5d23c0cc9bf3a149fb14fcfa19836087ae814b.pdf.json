            "text": "Physical activity (PA) is essential in maintaining health and living longer without chronic diseases by reducing the risk of certain chronic diseases and health outcomes through prescribed and preventative interventions [1\u20134]. The benefits of meeting PA recommendations include preventing and managing cardiovascular diseases [5\u20137], hypertension [6,8\u201310], cancer [10\u201312], stroke [12], diabetes [13,14], depression and anxiety [15,16], and improving overall well-being [13,17]. Since the 1970s, various organizations have invested tremendous efforts to advance PA advocacy in Healthy People 2020, now Healthy People 2030 [18]. Healthy People sets the United States public health agenda for a healthier society through physical activity [18]. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that early to midlife adults (i.e., aged 18\u201364 years) participate in 150\u2013300 min of moderate-intensity (or 75 min of high-intensity) aerobic PA and two muscle-strengthening sessions at moderate intensity or greater per week [19]. Individuals who do not meet the minimum PA standards are 20% to 30% more at risk for mortality than individuals who meet the criteria [19]. Beyond the minimum PA requirements, it is recommended that individuals limit their sedentary time [20] (ST). Excessive ST is associated with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and type-2 diabetes [19]. The term \u201cSedentary Lifestyle Syndrome\u201d (SLS), coined by Charansonney to describe long-term sedentary behavior, can be triggered by stress (i.e., a global pandemic) [21]. Prolonged \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders increased sedentary\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 11230. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811230 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 11230 2 of 17\nbehaviors, such as extended screen times and sitting (e.g., playing games, watching television, using mobile devices), and decreased PA. Prolonged ST hinders the body\u2019s ability to cope with environmental challenges and increases the chances of acute health conditions (i.e., myocardial infarctions) [22]. Studies show that sedentary time has increased [23] since initiating COVID-19\u2019s \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders [23\u201326]. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, less than a quarter of American adults met the PA recommendations, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) was considered a global emergency by the WHO in January 2020, [27] requiring states to issue \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders to prevent the spread of the virus [28]. These social distance mandates included mass shutdowns of popular PA resources (i.e., gyms, fitness centers, and parks) to slow the virus\u2019s spread. This immediately and drastically reduced many Americans\u2019 daily PA. Within just a few months of mandating these social distancing precautions, attempts to reverse diminished PA and increased ST were initiated. To encourage PA, many strategies and resources were mobilized. Work-place wellness programs provided virtual fitness classes and home exercise equipment [29]. Public health officials advised that outdoor activities (e.g., walking and running) [30] and community parks could allow individuals to exercise while maintaining physical distance [31]. Due to \u201cstay-at-home\u201d mandates, several gyms and fitness groups switched to physically distant or electronic options (i.e., e-lifestyles) for participants [32]. Individuals began to engage in PA using digital services [32]. Those with internet access had the resources to engage in e-lifestyles such as YouTube yoga, \u201clive online\u201d physical activity classes, and asynchronous walking/running programs. The American College of Sports Medicine also posted free \u201chow-to\u201d videos and other education for in-home PA programming [33]. Reduced PA is not as simple to treat as simply offering remote PA options. Despite all of these resources, after two years of chronic pandemic-related stress, PA has diminished even further [18]. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, but traumatic global emergencies requiring social distancing are well documented. The COVID-19 pandemic has been compared to several past pandemics (e.g., the Spanish Flu of 1918, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, Ebola, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS) regarding mental health (MH) outcomes [34\u201338]. Lee and colleagues found that health care workers in contact with patients diagnosed with MERS reported high stress and anxiety levels resulting in post-traumatic stress disorders [36]. Sims anecdotally describe how the sudden outbreak of MERS resulted in increased anxiety within the community [37]. During the Spanish Flu, Americans suffered from fear, anxiety, depression, and other acute MH issues [38]. For the outbreaks of SARS and Ebola, research reveals the alarming severity of emotional distress [36]. As for MERS, studies further support that residual psychological trauma and overwhelming mental distress alter normal behavior [36,37]. These historical pandemics present evidence that individuals may experience MH consequences during traumatic situations [38]. Learning from history should make us more aware of the PA consequences of other MH events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Because history affirms that stressful events are recurrent, understanding how diminished MH may impact PA is important to better prepare us in the future. MH conditions continue to be a leading cause of disability domestically and internationally, and the COVID-19 pandemic may further increase its burden across the population [39]. Of all the MH conditions resulting from social distancing measures, depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders are the most commonly reported. Like past pandemics, today\u2019s pandemic mirrors historical consequences of isolation/quarantine, such as boredom, anger, and loneliness [38]. COVID-19\u2019s social distancing measures have significantly affected the MH of people globally [40\u201347]. During COVID-19, the rate of depression increased five times [40,41], anxiety increased three times [42], PA decreased by 41% compared to pre-COVID-19 [43], and compliance with the standard PA recommendations decreased by over 80% [43]. It is not surprising as MH is a common comorbidity [46\u201348] for which PA is often recommended to treat or alleviate MH symptoms [46\u201348]. Those\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 11230 3 of 17\nnot able to isolate experience a heightened concern for common symptoms (such as cough and fever) that are now indicative of a COVID-19 infection, further exacerbating fear and anxiety for those actively limiting their own exposure [43]. Research has supported that these psychological factors, and others such as stress and social isolation, correlate with adverse health behaviors [44\u201348]. Psychological well-being promotes many healthy behaviors, while the lack thereof deters them [48]. As demonstrated, the complexity of stressful events can affect physical, social, mental, and general health [42]. Aptly, the COVID-19 pandemic has provided an opportunity to examine if diminished MH can actually be a precursor for decreased PA and potentially a contradiction for PA prescriptions [42]. Stanton et al. cross-sectionally surveyed 1492 adults in Australia and discovered that COVID-19\u2019s social distancing measures negatively impacted PA (48.9%), sleep (40.7%), alcohol consumption (26.6%), and smoking (6.9%) since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic [40]. They illustrated that these negative health behaviors in PA, sleep, smoking, and alcohol consumption were associated with increased depression, anxiety, and stress [40]. They further ascertained that long-lasting MH effects might arise from fear of infection, confusion, anger, post-traumatic stress symptoms, separation, frustration, boredom, lack of resources and information, financial loss, and stigma [40]. Likewise, other current literature identifies the most vulnerable psychological factors as isolation, fear, emotional stress, anxiety, and depression [38]. According to historically similar pandemics, any of these four acute MH illnesses may previse reduced PA [38]. The current pandemic allows us to analyze the MH and PA relationship in real-time compared to historical analysis from similar pandemics. In summary, the bleak reality is that many people are neglecting their mental and physical well-being. This observation leads us to consider alternative barriers to PA during these events. The pandemic\u2019s contribution to diminished MH promotes prolonged ST, decreased PA, and other adverse health behaviors [22,23,38]. In response to this recurrent co-occurrence and the known bi-directional relationship between PA and MH, we pose this research question: during excessively stressful events (i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic), does diminished MH serve as a barrier to PA? To answer this question, this review explores whether the pandemic\u2019s MH impact is a significant barrier to PA. Therefore, the study aims to review existing literature for articles that present diminished MH as an indicator of decreased PA to evaluate this alternate direction. We hypothesize that countless studies measure both MH and PA, but only a few will infer that acutely diminished MH may negatively impact PA."

Two studies reported that anxiety and PA were determined based on the participants\u2019 behavior before the pandemic. Kaygisi reported that female participants who were less anxious during the pandemic were more likely to engage in sports before the pandemic [63].

Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has had detrimental health consequences in both physical and MH. Some of the most concerning consequences discussed here include significant increases in emotional stress, depression, and/or anxiety paired with a continuous decline of PA. This mirrors the outcomes of historical pandemics that seem to repeat with extraordinary precision. This study provides evidence that acute MH illnesses such as anxiety, depression, and emotional stress can, in fact, hinder PA participation. Because diminished MH may impede PA, this study suggests that MH care should take precedence over PA reinstatement as we recover from the pandemic. These findings are unprecedented and greatly contribute to the existing literature by uniquely invoking the reverse directionality of the bi-directional relationship between MH and PA."

            "text": "To our knowledge, there are no studies that identify the degree of or duration at which MH may impede PA. Longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the directionality of the bi-directional relationship between MH and PA. Until this is evaluated, we cannot accurately discern the significance of this impedance. Additionally, the degree of diminished MH that interferes with PA is important to accurately define and to guide PA recommendations. Currently, there is no existing acute MH assessment to indicate if physical abilities are impacted. Furthermore, evaluating populations with existing MH diagnoses would contribute toward even greater validity of this barrier. Lastly, it may be interesting to introduce MH practices such as meditation, relaxation, deep social connection, coping skills, and self-reflection into PA regimes to boost physical skills beyond current limits. In any manner, MH practices should be incorporated into all levels of healthy lifestyle interventions."

Again, this makes generalizability less reliable. Because of the vastness in geographic locations and population cultural variations, MH and PA measurement tools varied. While most of the measurement tools were previously validated, they differed between each study. Due to the swiftness of related publications, it is possible that articles could have been incidentally omitted from this narrative review, especially those published in a language other than English and those that failed to explicitly compare the impact of diminished MH on PA. Lastly, and most notably, some cross-sectional studies assumed a potentially misleading causal relationship between MH and PA."

            "text": "Obviously, more desirable pandemic-era PA behaviors would lessen post-pandemic physical health consequences. However, acute MH episodes may be a contraindication for concurrent PA participation in the current pandemic. Assessing one\u2019s current stress levels may be a helpful tool for evaluating one\u2019s PA readiness. Incorporating MH assessments into existing PA pre-screening protocols would help identify if an individual should prioritize MH practices before initiating a PA regimen. For better PA outcomes in future pandemics, preventative MH and coping practices appear to be necessary. To learn from previous shortcomings, it would be wise to exit this pandemic with MH strategies in mind for immediate and long-term utilization for all adults experiencing diminished MH, especially those most affected: women and older adults. Furthermore, providing standardized MH care as a long-term health prevention strategy may alleviate many other adverse health behaviors during future pandemics, including excessive substance use, inadequate sleeping patterns, poor nutrition, and sedentary and screen times. Even more grand, achieving optimal MH may induce the intended objectives of Healthy People 2030.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, C.A. and N.A.; methodology, I.S.H.; software, C.A., validation, C.A. and I.S.H.; formal analysis, C.A. and I.S.H.; resources, C.A. and I.S.H.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, C.A.; writing\u2014review and editing, C.A. and I.S.H.; visualization, C.A. and I.S.H.; supervision, I.S.H.

Participants with the highest reported mental health deterioration were the least likely to be active. Most participants were unmotivated to exercise because they were anxious. The findings highlight the paradox between mental health and PA. People who wanted to be active to improve their mental health but found it challenging to be active due to their poor mental health.
