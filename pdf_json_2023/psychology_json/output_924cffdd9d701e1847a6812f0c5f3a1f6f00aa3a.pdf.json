    "abstractText": "The presence of ATP is known to stimulate helicase activity of the Dengue Virus Non-structural protein 3 helicase ( NS3h ) , and the presence of RNA stimulates NS3h ATPase activity, ho w e v er this coupling is still mechanistically unclear. Here we use atomistic models and molecular dynamics simulations to e v aluate the single-stranded RNA ( ssRNA ) -length dependence of the NS3h\u2013ssRNA binding affinity and its modulation by bound ATP. Considering complexes with 7, 11, 16 and 26 nucleotides ( nts ) , we observe that both the binding affinity and its modulation by bound ATP are augmented with increased ssRNA lengths. In models with at least 11 nts bound, the binding of ATP results in a shift from a tightly bound to a weakly bound state. We find that the weakly bound state persists during both the ADP-Piand ADP-bound stages of the catalytic cycle. We obtain the equilibrium association constants for NS3h binding to an ssRNA 10-mer in vitro , both in the absence and presence of ADP, which further support the alternation between tightly and weakly bound states during the catalytic cy cle. T he length of bound ssRNA is critical for understanding the NS3h\u2013RNA interaction as well as how it is modulated during the catalytic cycle. Gr aphical abstr act",

NS3 is involved in viral replication, encapsidation, host immune evasion and processing of the polyprotein precursor ( 5 ,6 ) . NS3 consists of an N-terminal serine protease domain ( residues 1 to 169 ) connected via a flexible linker to a C-terminal helicase domain ( residues 179 to 618 ) ( Figure 1 a ) . Despite its name, the C-terminal helicase domain of NS3 ( NS3h ) also functions as an NTPase, RTPase and possesses RNA annealing activities ( 7\u201310 ) . Importantly, these activities are retained to an extent even in recombinant NS3h isolated from the N-terminal protease domain ( 4 , 11 , 12 ) .\nEven though NS3h performs multiple functions, here we will focus on its role as an energy transducer or molecular motor that translocates along single-stranded and unwinds double-stranded RNA in a 3 \u2032 -to-5 \u2032 direction while catalyzing the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates ( NTPs ) . The NTPase and helicase activities of the DENV NS3h are coupled such that the hydrolysis of NTPs is necessary for the translocation along a strand of RNA or the unwinding of double-stranded RNA ( 12 ) . Crystallographic studies of the DENV NS3h have shed substantial light on our understanding of the physical mechanisms that underlie the coupled NTPase and helicase activities ( 13 ,14 ) . NS3h recognition of single stranded RNA ( ssRNA ) is known to be sequence independent ( 15 ) and crystal structures of NS3h in absence and presence of RNA have depicted that the NTPase catalytic site adopts a hydrolysis-competent conformation in presence of RNA. This conformational change has been proposed to be key in the RNA-stimulated NTPase activity ( 12 ) .\nCrystallographic structures of NS3h bound to ssRNA reveal only subtle conformational changes during the NTPase catalytic cycle ( 13 ) . This is in sharp contrast to the differences observed in the crystallographic snapshots obtained for the hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) NS3h, in which clear open and closed conformations could be mechanistically related to the RNA displacement that occurs during the NTPase hydrolysis cycle ( 16 ) . Even though the communication between the ATP binding site and the RNA binding site within the DENV NS3h is expected, thermodynamic data are still needed to confirm this hypothesis.\nIn previous work ( 17 ) , we focused on the ssRNA-bound NS3h structures and used molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations to further explore the conformational landscape of NS3h in three stages of the ATP hydrolysis cycle ( apo, ATP-bound and ADP-Pi-bound states ) . In these simulations, we observed a flexible-rigid-flexible alternation in the protein dynamics for the apo, ATP-bound and product-bound stages of the ATP hydrolysis cycle, respectively. Furthermore, we identified a novel open-loop conformation of the \u03b26- \u03b21 \u2032 loop ( residues 316 to 330 ) that forms a backdoor channel to the active site, facilitating the release of Pi, the first product of the ATP hydrolysis ( 18 ) . Other computational studies of the allostery in the DENV NS3h provided a possible description of the effect of RNA binding on the hydrolysis reaction and proposed that motif V controls the communication between the ATP and RNA binding sites ( 19 ,20 ) . Nevertheless, a thermodynamic relationship between the ATPase catalytic site and the RNA binding site has yet to be established.\nInterestingly, thermodynamic studies of the binding of the helicase to oligonucleotides of different lengths have been car-\nried out and indicate that the minimum ssRNA binding site size of NS3h is 10-11 nucleotides ( nts ) ( 15 ) . Although the available crystal structures of NS3h were obtained in complex with a 12-mer ssRNA, only 7 nucleotides ( nts ) were resolved ( 13 ) and of these 7 nts, only four appear to form stable interactions with the protein.\nHere, we test the hypothesis that the RNA binding site size ( namely, the number of nucleotides that form the NS3h\u2013 ssRNA interface ) of the DENV NS3h is indeed greater than the 7 nts resolved in the crystal structures, and ask whether the presence of a longer ssRNA is necessary to observe the interaction between the NTPase and RNA binding sites. To address this question, we modeled the DENV NS3h bound to a 7-, 11-, 16- and 26-mer ssRNA ( Figure 1 b ) and performed MD simulations to examine conformational changes in the protein as well as the relative RNA binding affinity in the presence or absence of A TP. W e then use a single ssRNA length ( 16 -mer ) to evaluate how the affinity of NS3h for ssRNA changes in different stages of the ATP hydrolysis cycle ( Figure 1 c ) . To evaluate the RNA binding affinity in different stages of the catalytic cycle, we used both molecular mechanics generalized born surface area ( MM-GBSA ) calculations from MD simulations as well as isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) and conclude that on binding ATP, the NS3h\u2013ssRNA complex shifts from a tightly bound to a weakly bound state, which is maintained until both products of hydrolysis are released. Together, these results clearly establish an allosteric communication between the ssRNA and ATP binding sites of NS3h. We relate the changes in affinity to conformational changes in the protein that shed light on the physical translocation mechanism."

Three additional complexes were created using this initial structure ( sequence corresponding to DENV 4 serotype ( residues 180 to 618 ) ) by adding a total of 4, 9 and 19 nts of adenosine. The nucleotides were added using the program VMD ( 21 ) to move copies of existing nucleotides to the corresponding ends of the RNA and saving the coordinates. Thus, four complexes were obtained: a 7-, 11-, 16- and 26-mer ssRNA, each bound to the NS3h with a free active site. For the 11-mer, two adenosines were added to each the 3 \u2032 and 5 \u2032 termini of the 7-mer in crystal structure, for the 16-mer 4 and 5 adenosines were added to the 3 \u2032 and 5 \u2032 termini, respectively, and for the 26-mer a total of 9 and 10 adenosines were added to the 3 \u2032 and 5 \u2032 termini, respectively.

            "text": "Effect of RNA length on NS3h\u2013RNA structural models NS3h evidences increased conformational flexibility when bound to longer ssRNA To gauge the ssRNA-length dependence of NS3h flexibility, we calculated the root mean squared deviation ( RMSD ) of the protein backbone atoms from the crystallographic conformation of NS3h bound to a 7-mer ssRNA ( PDB ID 2JLU ) . Histograms of the RMSD values corresponding to the concatenated three 1- \u03bcs simulations are shown in Figure 2 for each of the four ssRNA lengths considered ( 7, 11, 16 and 26- mers ) . The histograms indicate a shift toward higher values of RMSD for the NS3h bound to longer ssRNA, suggesting a larger deviation from the crystallographic conformation due to the presence of longer ssRNA. Furthermore, the histograms tend to broaden in states with longer ssRNA, suggesting increased conformational flexibility of the protein backbone on the timescales simulated. In general, the presence of ATP stabilizes the protein conformation ( Figure 2 , opaque series ) , as has been reported for other helicases ( 29 ,30 ) ; nevertheless, even these distributions broaden when longer ssRNA is bound to the protein.\nTo further explore the deviations from the crystallographic conformation due to the presence of longer ssRNA, we evaluated the per-residue root mean square fluctuation ( RMSF ) for the backbone atoms ( Figure 3 a and b ) . In both the apo and ATP-bound states, we found higher per-residue RMSF values for regions in D3, specifically in two \u03b1-helices: \u03b1-helix 3 \u2032\u2032 ( 526 to 541 ) and \u03b1-helix 7 \u2032\u2032 ( 603 to 616 ) , both of which grip the RNA within the binding site. Interestingly, the \u03b25A\u2019- \u03b25B\u2019 hairpin that we will refer to as the hydrophobic hairpin ( residues 426 to 448 ) ( Figure 3 b ) evidences increased flexibility in an ssRNA-length-dependent manner. In all cases of extended 11- , 16- and 26-mer ssRNA bound to NS3h, the 5 \u2032 end of the modeled RNA wraps around D3, forming new interactions with the protein ( Figure 3 c ) .\nIn all the crystallographic structures of the DENV NS3h the \u03b26- \u03b21 \u2032 loop ( Figure 3 d ) is in a single \u2018closed\u2019 conformation. In our previous work ( 17 ,18 ) , we showed that this loop can also adopt an open conformation that kinetically favors the release of the first product of the ATP hydrolysis, Pi ( 18 ) . The open conformation of the \u03b26- \u03b21 \u2032 loop was observed in our previous work ( 17 ) , albeit with low probability ( \u223c10% ) , in simulations of the apo and product-bound complexes, whereas it remained in the closed-loop conformation in the presence of ATP. In this work, we observed that regardless of the ssRNA length, the presence of ATP stabilizes the closed-loop conformation ( Figure 3 b ) . The variation of the oligonucleotide length from 7 to 26 nts does not appear to significantly affect the openclosed conformational equilibrium observed in the 1- \u03bcs simulations ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) .\nAlthough the 3 \u2032 end of the RNA is more flexible ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) , it tends to curl for the most part around D1 ( Figure 3 c ) . Similar to the trend observed in the\nflexibility of the 3 \u2032 end of the RNA, it is interesting to note that even though the overall flexibility of the protein decreases upon binding ATP ( Figure 2 ) , the flexibility of the RNA binding loop ( residues 243 to 256 ) , in turn, increases ( Figure 3 b ) .\nRNA binding site of NS3h occupies appro ximatel y 10 nts To estimate the RNA binding site size of NS3h, we considered the solvent accessible surface area ( S AS A ) of each nucleotide of the ssRNA fragment, under the assumption that the nucleotides forming part of the RNA binding site are less accessible to solvent molecules. Thus, we selected a certain S AS A range as a threshold, and consider nucleotides with S AS A below this threshold to be part of the binding site.\nThe minimum ssRNA binding site size based on in vitro experiments has been reported to be \u223c10 nts ( 15 ) . Here, we use the per -nucleotide ( per -nt ) S AS A to map out the RNA binding site size of NS3h bound to ssRNA fragments of increas-\nFigure 3.

The nucleotides are numbered accordng to its corresponding base as in the scheme in Figure 1 b, ith the crystallographic 7-mer numbered from 0 to 6 and egative values or values > 6 indicating those added to the \u2032 or 3 \u2032 termini, respectively. From this point on we will use he notation B x , with x being the base number according to his numbering scheme, to refer to specific positions in the ligonucleotides. For the 7-mer complex, both of the series of Figure 4 a reects a similar pattern of lower S AS A values for B 0 to B 4 . Thus, he apparent RNA binding site size in this case is roughly 5 nts, ith the bases toward the 3 \u2032 terminus being more solvent-\nxposed, which is consistent with their observed higher flexiility ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . On extending the length of he ssRNA, the adjacent nucleotides adopt stable conformaions ( Figure 4 b-d ) , increasing the size of the RNA binding ite ( Table 2 ) . This trend is upheld for the lengths of ssRNA onsidered here, with an RNA binding site size of 9\u201311 nts oberved for the apo system, which coincides with the reported inimum occluded RNA binding site size determined in vitro 15 ) . In contrast to that of the apo complex, the RNA bindng site size of the ATP-bound complex is two bases longer at he 3 \u2032 end in the 26-mer compared to the 16-mer; however in oth cases, the site starts at B -2 . An estimation of the RNA site ize for NS3h bound to ATP ( or an analogue ) in bulk has not een reported yet. We obtained comparable results by analyz-\ning the per-nt RMSF, considering nts with low RMSF values as part of the RNA binding site ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . By comparing the distribution of center-of-mass distances between D1 and D2, we were able to discard the possibility that the observed increase in the RNA binding site size may be due to a separation of the two subdomains, and is indeed due to the ssRNA forming new transient interactions with the protein ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) .\nThe apparent RNA binding site sizes estimated from the per-nt S AS A analysis with the threshold indicated in Figure 4 are summarized in Table 2 as ranges, where the lower and upper ends of the ranges correspond to the RNA binding site size considering the lower and upper threshold values, respectively ( see Supplementary Figure S4 for further analysis on threshold selection ) . Notably, the size of the RNA binding site does not change significantly between the 16- and 26-mer complexes. We further observe that although the presence of ATP ( Figure 4 , opaque circles ) hardly affects the apparent RNA binding site size in the 7-mer or the 11-mer complexes, it does\nFigure 4.

Again, this observation is independent of the relative D1\u2013 D2 orientation, which appears to always adopt a more closed conformation in presence of ATP, regardless of the length of bound ssRNA ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . These results indicate that an oligonucleotide of 16 nts is more adequate than one of 7 or 11 nts in terms of accurately modeling the NS3h\u2013 ssRNA binding site size.\nModulation of the NS3h\u2013ssRN A affinity b y ATP depends on ssRNA length To further assess how the NS3h\u2013RNA interaction changes in the presence of a longer oligonucleotide, we estimated the NS3h\u2013RNA binding free energy for each complex using a MM-GBSA approach ( Figure 5 ) . The overall NS3h\u2013RNA binding energy decreases as the length of the oligonucleotide increases from 7 to 26 nts, while the per-nt stabilization, rep-\nresented by the slope, drops with the increase of the ssRNA length, suggesting that the binding energy for the 26-mer complex is approximating a converged length-independent binding free energy ( Supplementary Table S1 ) .\nThe effect of ATP binding is dramatically impacted by the oligonucleotide length. The relative change in RNA binding free energy for the apo and ATP-bound complexes ( note the gap between black and gray series in Figure 5 and Supplementary Table S2 ) is null for the 7-mer, and it becomes more evident as the ssRNA length is increased to 11, 16 and 26 nts. Thus, the presence of ATP results in a weaker NS3h\u2013RNA binding interaction. This would provide evidence of the allostery between the RNA and ATP binding sites, which has only previously been reported in terms of the kinetics of the NTPase activity ( 8 ) . We further note that the decrease in RNA affinity due to the presence of ATP is similar to the effect reported for the HCV NS3h ( 31 ,32 ) . The estimated size of the RNA binding site together with the modulation of RNA affinity by ATP, both observed exclusively for complexes with extended ( > 10-nt ) oligonucleotides, suggest that the transient interactions formed with the extended ssRNA fragments are necessary to accurately model the NS3h\u2013RNA complex.\nConformational and thermodynamic changes during the catalytic cycle RNA binding site size and NS3h\u2013RNA binding free energy The analysis of the varying ssRNA lengths considered so far suggests that the RNA binding site size is similar for the 16- and 26-mer complexes ( Table 2 ) and the relative difference in RNA-NS3h binding free energy for apo and ATP-bound complexes is similar for the 11-, 16- and 26-mer complexes ( Figure 5 ) . Taking into account the 6-fold increase in computational time required to simulate the 26-mer system compared to the 16-mer, we selected the latter as a representative model with sufficiently long ssRNA bound to further explore the product-bound stages of the ATP hydrolysis cycle.\nT m h e A\ne 1 s t p ( A s n\no a t r R o p r\ne s ( w R t b s b G i t A l b N s A f b c c o s\nA m T b R s t m N a ( o A t\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/20/11213/7308684 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 11 January 2024\no analyze the dynamics of the NS3h bound to ssRNA ( 16- er ) throughout the catalytic cycle, we took a closer look at ow the RNA binding site size and NS3h\u2013RNA binding free nergy change for the apo, ATP-bound, ADP-Pi-bound and DP-bound complexes. In Figure 6 a, we show the per-nucleotide S AS A values for ach of the four stages, with a horizontal band indicating a 05\u2013115 \u00c52 threshold used to determine the RNA binding ite size of the NS3h. As mentioned earlier, in the apo complex he size of the RNA binding site is \u223c10 nts ( B -3 to B 8 ) , and the resence of ATP in the catalytic site reduces this size by 4 nts B -2 to B 5 ) ( Schematic in Figure 6 b ) . Although the presence of DP-Pi does not cause an overall change in the RNA binding ite size, the site appears to shift slightly toward the 3 \u2032 termius. On binding ATP, we also note an increase in the flexibility f the 3 \u2032 terminus that is retained in both the ADP-Pi-bound nd ADP-bound complexes, whereas the 5 \u2032 terminus appears o stabilize after hydrolysis and then destabilize again with the elease of the first product of the ATP hydrolysis, Pi ( per-nt MSF in Supplementary Figure S5 ) . The increased flexibility f the RNA binding loop on ATP binding is retained in the resence of the products of hydrolysis, but after phosphate elease this loop is stabilized again ( Supplementary Figure S6 ) .\nUsing ITC and spectroscopy experiments, we obtained the quilibrium constants for the binding of the NS3h to a 10-mer sRNA in the absence ( 5 \u00b1 1 \u00d7 10 6 M -1 ) and in the presence 3 \u00b1 1 \u00d7 10 3 M \u22121 ) of ADP ( Figure 6 c ) . These results agree ith the existence of the interaction between the NTP and NA binding sites, as the presence of ADP results in a reducion of the equilibrium association constant for NS3h\u2013ssRNA inding. In Figure 6 c, we also show the estimated NS3h\u2013 sRNA binding free energies for the apo, ATP-bound, ADPound and ADP-Pi-bound complexes, calculated using MMBSA for the 16-mer system. Again, we observed a reduction n the affinity for ssRNA in the presence of ATP, relative to he apo complex, and similar binding energies for the ADP, DP-Pi and ATP-bound complexes. These results indicate at east two energetic states of the NS3h\u2013RNA complex: a tightly ound state with a free NTPase catalytic site, in which the S3h RNA binding site size is \u223c10 nts; and a weakly bound tate, in which this size is nearly 7 nts, observed on binding TP and after hydrolysis. The computed binding free energies or the four modeled complexes ( apo, ATP-bound, ADP-Piound and ADP-bound ) highlight that the apo NS3h\u2013RNA omplex is bound more tightly than the complex with an ocupied NTP binding site, which is also consistent with the bserved difference in measured equilibrium association contants for the apo- and ADP-bound complexes.\nmong increased conf ormational fle xibility, relative subdoain movements are identified o further probe the interaction between the RNA and ATP inding sites, we asked how the distances between conserved NA-binding residues on D1 and D2 change during the four\ntages of the ATP hydrolysis cycle, and how they relate to disances between relevant amino acids ( residues from conserved otifs I, III and VI ) from the ATP-binding site ( Figure 7 ) . amely, we calculated two inter-subdomain D1\u2013D2 distances t the RNA-binding region ( d RNA ) and the ATP-binding cleft d ATP ) . d RNA is computed as the distance between the centers f mass ( COM ) of residues Arg 225 and Thr 244 on D1, and rg 387 and Thr 408 on D2, which are conserved amino acids hat anchor the RNA to the NS3h. d is calculated as the\nATP\nCOM distance between residues 195, 196, 197 ( from motif I ) , 316 and 317 ( from motif III ) and residues 458 to 463 ( from motif VI ) ( Figure 7 a ) . Figure 7 b shows the 2D density plots for d RNA vs d ATP for the NS3h in its apo, ATP-bound and productbound stages, in all cases bound to a 16-mer ssRNA.\nIn the apo state, we observe that the protein explores a wide range of d RNA values ( from 12 to 16 \u00c5) , as well as d ATP values ( from 8 to 15 \u00c5) , with greater d ATP distances being more favorable. On binding ATP, although the d ATP values are restrained substantially ( clustered around 9 \u00c5) , we found two populations in the d RNA dimension, such that the RNA-binding residues are mainly either 13 or 15 \u00c5 apart, with the former being substantially more populated. After hydrolysis, we observe that these two populations persist but larger d RNA values become more probable and the flexibility in the d ATP dimension is recovered, as indicated by greater inter-subdomain distances at the ATP-binding level. Interestingly, at this stage of the catalytic cycle ( in presence of both products of hydrolysis ) , when the ATP binding site explores a more open conformation, the RNA binding site necessarily closes and vice versa. In contrast, after the release of the Pi, some flexibility is lost again and a new cluster appears with intermediate values of both distances at the same time.\nAs mentioned before, the crystals bound to ssRNA show almost no difference between the different stages of the hydrolysis cycle ( Figure 7 b, black crosses ) , and the values for d RNA correspond to the cluster recurrently observed at \u223c9 \u00c5. Interestingly, for the apo crystal in the absence of RNA, a d RNA length of close to 17 \u00c5 is observed ( Figure 7 b, gray cross ) . This value is close to the cluster observed in more flexible states.\nAsymmetric distribution of contacts between NS3h and ssRNA To characterize the changes in the RNA binding mode of the DENV NS3h during ATP hydrolysis, we analyzed the number of NS3h\u2013RNA contacts per frame for the simulations of the apo, ATP-bound, ADP-bound and ADP-Pi-bound states, all with the 16-mer oligonucleotide bound ( Table 3 ) . Contacts were defined as pairs of residues and nucleotides with centers of mass within 7 \u00c5 ( Supplementary Figure S7 ) . For the apo complex ( i.e. the tightly bound state ) , the number of contacts is also higher than that for the other stages of the catalytic cycle, and most are formed between the 3 \u2032 half of the ssRNA and D1, but there are also many contacts between the 5 \u2032 half and D2. In both the ATP-bound and product-bound states, a fraction of the contacts with D1 and D2 are lost, and they are replaced by new contacts with D3, which interacts with the bases of the oligonucleotide but not with the phosphodiester backbone ( Figure 3 c ) . This shift corresponds to a change in the orientation of subdomain D3 relative to D1 and D2. In both the ATP and product-bound complexes, we observe an apparent downward movement of D3, which clamps down onto the nucleic acid strand ( Supplementary Figure S8 ) . After the release of Pi, the contacts with D3 are lost again; D1 contacts with the 3 \u2032 end are recovered, but D2 contacts with the 5 \u2032 end are not. These results correlate with the shift toward the 3 \u2032 end observed in the RNA binding site after hydrolysis.\nWe further characterized the interactions between the four NS3h residues from d RNA ( Arg 225, Thr 244, Arg 387 and Thr 408 ) , which anchor the RNA to the protein. The crystal structures ( PDB IDs 2JLU, 2JLV, 2JLZ and 2JLY ) show that the Arg residues interact with the phosphodiester backbone of the oligonucleotide through the backbone amide ( NH ) and with its positively charged lateral chain; and the threonines\nFigure 6.

When we calculated the percentage of the simulation frames in which the anchors were bound to their corresponding nucleotides and compared those that are present in at least 50% of the simulation frames, we observed that Arg 387 establishes stable interactions with bases B 1 and B 2 only after hydrolysis.\nFurthermore, we observed a base flipping in B -1 in both ADP-Pi- and ADP-bound complexes, that could also be related to the slight shift and the reduction in the ssRNA binding site size at the 5 \u2032 end. Amino acids in the positions of Pro 431 and Leu 429 from the hydrophobic hairpin have been proposed to act as a \u2018bookend\u2019 breaking the stacking of the bases\nat the RNA 5 \u2032 terminus for other flavivirus ( 33 ,34 ) and for other helicases of the DExH ATPase family ( 35 ) . For the apo and ATP-bound complexes, we observed that B -1 was close to the bookend amino acids, but for the ADP-Pi and ADP complexes, this base moves away ( Supplementary Table S4 ) . After the chemical step the base stacking between B 0 and B -1 is lost because of the B -1 flipping. To show this movement, we compared the distance between the center of mass of stacked bases B 1 and B 0 , as it is maintained in the four stages of the catalytic cycle, with that of B 0 and B -1 and we find that the latter increased for the ADP-Pi- and ADP-bound complexes ( Supplementary Figure S10, Supplementary Table S4 ) . At the 3 \u2032 end of the ssRNA, we also observed an allosteric effect as\nFigure 7. ( A ) Schematic representation of the protein showing the distances d RNA and d ATP .

In our previous MD simulations of the NS3h ound to the 7-mer ssRNA, we further observed a great deal of exibility at the 3 \u2032 terminus of the 7-mer. Importantly, neither he crystal structures nor these MD simulations were able to apture the expected conformational changes due to the occuancy of the NTPase catalytic site. The overall structure was onserved on average, with a notable flexible-rigid-flexible hange in the apo, ATP-bound, product-bound stages of the TP hydrolysis cycle. In this work, we observe that the pres-\nence of extended 11-, 16- and 26-nts ssRNA bound to NS3h enhances the flexibility of the protein backbone and that its structure deviates up to 2.5 \u00c5 from the crystallographic conformation ( Figures 2 and 3 ) .\nWe attribute the increase in RMSD for the protein bound to longer strands of nucleic acid to the formation of transient protein\u2013RNA interactions, which prompt the exploration of different conformations that were not accessible with shorter RNA oligonucleotides. Regardless of the length of ssRNA, ATP retains its stabilizing effect, as has been reported for other helicases ( 30 ) , but even the ATP-bound complexes with longer ssRNA are more flexible than those with a shorter oligonucleotide.\nThe structural deviations observed with the elongation of the RNA strand are predominantly located in the D3 region ( Figure 3 a and b ) and could be due to the interactions between the protein and the ssRNA 5 \u2032 terminus ( Figure 3 c ) . In particular, the hydrophobic hairpin interacts with the RNA bases at the 5 \u2032 end ( Figure 3 c ) . In the presence of double-stranded RNA, the hydrophobic hairpin might compete with the displaced strand of the RNA, participating with the unwinding process. This hypothesis would agree with the model proposed by ( 13 ) in which the hairpin acts as a wedge, preventing the\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/20/11213/7308684 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 11 January 2024\nRNA from forming the duplex. Druggable pockets near the hairpin may be used for possible inhibition of the helicase activity. It is important to note that in this work our simulations were designed to model the complex relevant in the translocation of NS3h along single-stranded RNA. Future studies including the duplex junction, and even considering structured ssRNA at the 5 \u2032 terminus are needed to further probe the allostery of NS3.\nRNA binding site size and potential sub-step One of the objectives of this work was to test the hypothesis that a ssRNA longer than 7 nts is necessary to accurately describe the RNA binding site size of the NS3h. This hypothesis was driven by fluorescence titration experiments of the NS3h with oligonucleotides of different lengths, in which the reported minimum RNA binding site size was 10\u201311 nts. In this work, we observe an RNA binding site size of \u223c10 nts in absence of ATP in both 16- and 26-mer-bound complexes. We further observe that the size of the RNA binding site is reduced by \u223c3 nts in the presence of ATP, and this reduction is maintained after hydrolysis before products are released. Although the reduced size of the RNA binding site does not change much after hydrolysis, it is shifted one nucleotide toward the 3 \u2032 terminus ( Figure 6 a ) . In both 16- and 26-mer apo complexes, the first base of the site is B -3 , but on binding ATP, one nucleotide is released and the site starts at B -2 . Moreover, the tendency continues post-hydrolysis ( first base B -1 ) and after the release of the first product, Pi ( B 0 ) . Taking into account that the NS3h directionality along the RNA is toward the 5 \u2032 end and that it is expected to move one base per ATP hydrolysis cycle, one might expect that after the release of the ADP, the first base at the site would be B -4 , and so on. The interactions between the NS3h anchors ( Arg 225, Thr 244, Arg 387 and Thr 408 ) and the ssRNA are mostly conserved in the four stages of the catalytic cycle except for Arg 387 ( motif IVa ) , which does not establish stable interactions with any nucleotide in the apo and ATP-bound complexes, but does play an important role in both product-bound stages. Interestingly, the simulations show that the side chain of Arg 387 tends to maintain its interaction with B 1 for longer than with B 2 post-hydrolysis ( Supplementary Figure S9, Supplementary Table S3 ) . Thus, it would be reasonable to think that the probability of a step in the 3 \u2032 -to-5 \u2032 direction would be higher than in the opposite direction. Conformational changes in this amino acid side chain have also been reported to be related to a step of NS3h displacement along ssRNA in another computational study of the DENV NS3h ( 19 ) .\nSufficiently long ssRNA is necessary to describe the allosteric interaction between RNA and ATP binding sites The decrease in the size of the RNA binding site of the NS3h due to the presence of ATP is consistent with the observed decrease in the binding affinity for RNA due to the presence of ATP, ADP-Pi or ADP in the catalytic site. An observed decrease in the affinity for RNA due to the presence of ATP has also been reported for the HCV NS3h ( 31 ,32 ) .\nOur results indicate that the allostery between the RNA and ATP binding sites is influenced by the length of the oligonucleotide: without a sufficiently long oligonucleotide such allostery is not observed. This result indicates that the transient protein\u2013RNA interactions play a critical role in the allostery\nbetween the RNA and ATP binding sites. The increased affinity observed for longer ssRNA oligonucleotides is an example of a phenomenon described as the Coulombic end effect ( CEE ) ( 36\u201339 ) , caused by the strong axial dependence of the surface electrostatic potential of nucleic acids, which leads to a transition between oligoelectrolyte to polyelectrolyte behavior of the nucleic acid in the range of ssRNA lengths examined here. In this context, considering the charge of the NS3h and the characteristic CEE length of 9 nts ( 38 ) , we would expect that the binding free energy would cease to be length dependent at \u223c23 nts. Of course, this prediction is for a model that does not take into consideration the association of multiple NS3h molecules, which is a separate effect that has also been reported to cause a length dependence of the observed binding affinity of NS3h to ssRNA in solution ( 15 ) .\nThe DENV genome ( \u223c11 kb ) is much longer than the ssRNA lengths studied here; however this genomic RNA is in large part structured on itself and in complex with viral and host RNA binding proteins, likely leaving much smaller stretches of ssRNA exposed during the viral life cycle ( 40 ) . Furthermore, small RNA fragments of 15 to 30 nts are known to be present in mammalian host cells and the distribution of these lengths has been shown to be affected by viral infection ( 41 ) . We are thus confident that an understanding of the length-dependence of the interaction between NS3h and ssRNA is a critical aspect in future drug discovery efforts, in particular in the design of allosteric inhibitors that may leverage novel pockets and conformational changes in the protein structure.\nChanges in transient protein\u2013RNA interactions during ATP hydrolysis The analysis of protein\u2013RNA contacts ( Table 3 ) reveals that to a large extent, the reduced affinity in the ATP- and productbound complexes can be attributed to a loss of interactions between the 3 \u2032 half of ssRNA and subdomain D1. Interestingly, although the total number of contacts with the 5 \u2032 half of the ssRNA is approximately constant in all four stages, there is a notable shift in the fraction of the interactions from D2 to D3. Thus, the RNA interactions with the two RecA-like subdomains are to a large extent replaced by new interactions with D3 on binding of ATP and even after hydrolysis. After release of Pi, these new interactions with D3 are lost again. The correlation between the change in the percentage of contacts with D3 and the estimated binding free energy suggests that the electrostatic interaction between D1 and D2 with the phosphodiester backbone of the oligonucleotide would give the complex a lower binding energy compared to the interactions between the bases of the oligonucleotide and D3.\nWhen we further take into account the distance between key RNA-binding residues ( d RNA ) or key ATP-binding residues ( d ATP ) on the two RecA-like subdomains D1 and D2, we observe a clear population shift in terms of both separations during the ATP hydrolysis cycle. In terms of the separation of RNA-binding residues, roughly two populations are observed at \u223c14.5 and 12.5 \u00c5, \u2018relaxed\u2019 and \u2018tense\u2019, respectively . Interestingly , variations in the d RNA distance are characteristic of the difference between the crystal structures of the DENV NS3h obtained in the presence and absence of ssRNA, with larger values being observed in the absence of ssRNA ( see crosses in Figure 7 b ) . In the apo state, the relaxed RNA binding mode is more favorable than the tense mode, whereas\nt s s t i O s o t i d i ( e\nC u T w w D T d i\nc s i b w o s t 3 p R fl T t b a d h p w l\nC T i e c t t s s h t t o c\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/20/11213/7308684 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 11 January 2024\nhe opposite is observed for both the ATP- and ADP-Pi-bound tates, and the physical gap between the two states widens lightly in these cases cases as well. Similarly, a relaxed and ense conformation of the ATP binding site can be identified n the apo state, with the relaxed state being more favorable. n binding of ATP, these residues are exclusively in the tense tate, characterized by lower d ATP distances, and on hydrolysis f ATP, the relaxed state is explored once more. It is interesting o note that although the tense RNA binding mode is favored n presence of ATP, the relaxed mode characterized by larger RNA distances is still explored. Mechanistically, this could be nterpreted as the protein \u2018loosening its grip\u2019 on the ssRNA Figure 5 a ) on tightening its grip on ATP, thus permitting the xploration of multiple binding modes along the nucleic acid.\nonfigurational entropy as a driving force for nidirectional translocation he D3 subdomain shows an increased number of contacts ith the ssRNA for the ATP- and ADP-Pi-bound complexes, hich corresponds to an apparent downward movement of 3 toward the ssRNA in the presence of ATP and products. hese additional interactions could also help in biasing the irectionality of the movement toward the 5 \u2032 terminus, which s where it has key contacts.\nThe per-nt S AS A analysis of the different RNA oligonuleotides considered highlights the general tendency of flexible sRNA termini, with a stable, highly interacting core. On takng a closer look at the per-nt RMSF values for the apo, ATPound and product-bound states ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) , e can further identify a change in the asymmetrical aspect f these fluctuations. In the apo system, the 3 \u2032 terminus ( right ide ) is stabilized, and the highest RMSF values are located at he 5 \u2032 terminus ( left side ) . On binding of ATP, however, the\n\u2032 terminus becomes as flexible as the 5 \u2032 terminus, and in the resence of the products ADP and Pi, the flexibility of the ssNA is localized at the 3 \u2032 terminus. After release of Pi, the exibility of the 5 \u2032 terminus is recovered for the most part. his change in the asymmetry of the flexibility of nucleotides\noward the 3 \u2032 and 5 \u2032 termini, in addition to the increased moility of the 3 \u2032 terminus on hydrolysis of ATP\u2014that is likely ssociated with a large entropic cost for advancing in the 3 \u2032\nirection\u2014are consistent with the 3 \u2032 -to-5 \u2032 directionality of the elicase. The stabilization of the 5 \u2032 terminus exclusively in the resence of ADP-Pi suggests that a step in the 5 \u2032 direction ould be the least costly before or concomitant with Pi re-\nease.\nonclusion he use of atomistic models and MD simulations have become ntegral components in drug discovery pipelines. We and othrs have simulated the NS3h\u2013ssRNA complex as it has been rystallized, with a 7-nts ssRNA fragment bound, to elucidate he allosteric networks that connect the NTPase active site o the RNA binding site. Contrary to our expectations, the imulations did not indicate substantial changes in the NS3h\u2013 sRNA interaction due to the presence of ATP or products of ydrolysis ( 17 ) . Here, we have established that the length of he bound ssRNA fragment is critical in accurately capturing his allostery, in which the presence of ATP, ADP or products f hydrolysis result in a more weakly bound NS3h\u2013ssRNA omplex than in the apo state. These results are of direct im-\nplication in the interpretation of in vitro studies of the NS3h with ssRNA as well as in future computational drug discovery efforts for NS3 inhibitors."
