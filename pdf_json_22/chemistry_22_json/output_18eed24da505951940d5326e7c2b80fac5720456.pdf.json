Chemical context\nQuinolone-based compounds have become strikingly conspicuous in recent years. Generally, quinolone derivatives can possess antibacterial, antiparasitic and antiviral (including malaria, hepatitis, HIV, herpes), anticancer and immunosuppressant activities. They can be used in the treatment of obesity, diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases (Horta et al., 2017). Thus, in this work, we decided to broaden the scope of the quinolone scaffolds utilized in our previous works (Bylov et al., 1999; Silin et al., 2004; Savchenko et al., 2007; Hryhoriv et al., 2021) toward a promising new class of arylsulfonylquinolin derivatives, namely ethyl 1-(3-tosylquinolin-4-yl)piperidine-4carboxylate.\nEffective synthetic approaches toward these compounds are versatile. The most notable among them are green chemistry methods and microwave-assisted synthesis (Dhiman et al., 2019; Atechian et al. 2007). However, to date, very few data are available for arylsulfonylquinolins. Kang et al. (2016) described a straightforward and mild one-pot method to synthesize 3-(phenylsulfonyl)-2,3-dihydro-4(1H)quinolinones via a Cu-catalyzed aza-Michael addition/base-mediated cyclization reaction. Other researchers (Ivachtchenko et al.\nISSN 2056-9890\nPublished under a CC BY 4.0 licence\n2012a,b) have reported new 3-(phenylsulfonyl)quinoline derivatives as serotonin 5-HT receptor antagonists, performed molecular docking studies, and proposed them for preventing and treating central nervous system (CNS) diseases such as psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, and obesity. The preparation method for 3-methanesulfonylquinolines such as GABA-B enhancers was patented by Malherbe et al. (2006). In vivo investigations of 4-amino-3arylsulfoquinolin derivatives as metabotropic glutamate 5(mGlu) receptor negative allosteric modulators have shown efficacy for treating anxiety and depression (Galambos et al., 2017).\nIn the present paper, we study an optimal synthetic route for ethyl 1-(3-tosylquinolin-4-yl)piperidine-4-carboxylate and report its molecular and crystal structures as well as potential biological properties."

The presence of two bulky substituents in vicinal positions at the pyridine ring results in a rotation of the piperidine ring with respect to the bicyclic fragment [the dihedral angle between their mean planes is 76.83 (13) ]. The piperidine ring adopts a chair conformation with puckering parameters (Zefirov et al., 1990) S = 1.16 (1), = 0.6 (1) , = 66.2 (12) . The atoms N2 and C19 deviate from the mean plane of the other ring atoms by 0.640 (2) and 0.675 (3) A\u030a, respectively. The atom N2 has a pyramidal configuration with a bond-angle sum of 345.4 . The ethyl ester group is located in an equatorial position with respect to the piperidine ring [the C17\u2014C18\u2014C19\u2014C22 torsion angle is 179.8 (2) ]. It is disordered over the two positions (A and B) due to rotation around the C19\u2014C22 bond with an occupancy ratio of 0.562 (12):0.438 (12). The ethyl group is almost orthogonal to the carboxylic fragment in conformer A and is located in the intermediate position\nbetween +ac and ap in conformer B [the C22\u2014O4\u2014C23\u2014C24 torsion angle is 98.1 (14) and 150 (2) in conformers A and B, respectively].

The first is formed by an oxygen atom of the carboxylic group and a hydrogen atom of the benzene ring (Fig. 2a). An oxygen atom of the sulfonyl group is involved in the second hydrogen bond, similarly with a hydrogen atom of the benzene ring (Fig. 2b). Connected with the initial molecule by the symmetry operations x 12, y + 32, z + 12 and x + 1 2, y + 32, z + 12, these hydrogen bonds are affected by both twofold screw axes <010> and glide plane family {010}.

The standard \u2018high\u2019 surface resolution was used. Two regions with dnorm significantly lower than the van der Waals contact length (in red) emerge on the surface (Fig. 3a). Both of them concern the C4\u2014H4 O3A hydrogen bond and show it to be the sole directed interaction in the crystal. The chains built up by these hydrogen bonds are parallel to the [101] direction. However, they cannot be considered as a structural motif because the aforementioned hydrogen bonds are very weak, exist solely for conformer A and one of them was not revealed for conformer B. At the same time, the short contact C24B O1 appears just for conformer B (Fig. 3b). Differences in the distribution of dnorm for the two conformers and so the short\ncontacts and hydrogen bonds can be easily be seen from the two projections (top and bottom) shown in Fig. 3.\nIn addition to the Hirshfeld surface analysis, the 2D fingerprint plots were computed for ethyl 1-(3-tosylquinolin-4yl)piperidine-4-carboxylate. The contributions of the three types of intermolecular contacts get to areas with the values of the internal and external distances (di and de) below the van der Waals radii of the corresponding atoms (Fig. 4). These contributions belong to the short O H, C H and H H contacts. They are 20.2% and 19.9% of the Hirshfeld surface area for H O/O H for the disorder components A and B, respectively, 16.7% and 17.7%, respectively, for C H/H C and 54.3% for H H. The differences for the disordered positions A and B can be explained by the rearrangement of the interactions network described above."

            "text": "The strength of the non-classical C\u2014H O hydrogen bonds is often underestimated, as mentioned in Sutor (1962) and Desiraju (1996, 2005). Thus, to extend the knowledge of the supramolecular structure of the title compound and to prove the small contribution of these interactions to the structure, analysis of the pairwise interaction energies was performed as proposed by Konovalova et al. (2010) and Shishkin et al. (2012). The procedure was implied in a very similar way to the one described in detail in Vaksler et al. (2021). The single\n892 Vaksler et al. C24H26N2O4S Acta Cryst. (2022). E78, 890\u2013896\nresearch communications\nmolecule was considered as a building unit. The interactions in the molecular pairs containing the aforementioned hydrogen bonds are 7.4 and 10.5 kcal mol 1 for conformer A and 3.2 and 11.7 kcal mol 1 for conformer B (data given for the C24B O1 short contact and the C5\u2014H5 O2 hydrogen bond). These values are comparable to those for the nondirected interactions in other pairs of neighboring molecules. In addition to this, the interaction energy decomposition was performed using an \u2018accurate\u2019 energy model in CrystalExplorer17 for the molecular pairs with C\u2014H O hydrogen bonds. It showed that the sum of electrostatic and polarization components is rather low in comparison with the dispersion and repulsion terms ( 1.0 versus 7.5 and 2.6 kcal mol 1 for the C4\u2014H4 O3A hydrogen bond, 4.6 versus 9.7 and 4.2 kcal mol 1 for C5\u2014H5 O2) implying minimal contributions of hydrogen bonds in general bonding. Despite the apparent layering (Fig. 5a) parallel to the (010) plane, the energetic structure of the title compound can be considered isotropic, which can easily be seen from the energy vector diagrams (Fig. 5b). The total energy of interaction between a basic molecule and its first coordination sphere is 95.8 and 95.5 kcal mol 1 for conformers A and B, respectively."

For receptor-oriented flexible docking, the Autodock 4.2 software package (Morris et al., 2009) was used. Ligands were prepared using the MGL Tools 1.5.6 (Sanner, 1999) and optimized within the Avogadro (Hanwell et al., 2012) (United Force Field with the steepest descent algorithm). The biotargets were chosen on the basis of structural similarity between the title compound and known antibacterial agents from the group of fluoroquinolones.

These parameters were chosen to bring the formation of a complex between the tested molecule and the receptor as close as possible to the conditions that exist in biological systems.\nInhibitory activity against bacterial targets can be realized by the formation of their complexes with ligands [as ethyl 1-(3- tosylquinolin-4-yl)piperidine-4-carboxylate]. In turn, the stability of complexes can be estimated from the strength of the intermolecular interactions. The scoring function indicating the enthalpy contribution to the value of the free binding energy (affinity DG), the values of the free binding energy and binding constants [EDoc (kcal mol 1) and Ki ( M)] are represented for the most profitable conformation positions (Table 2).

In the first stage, the addition of methyl propiolate 2 to aniline 1 produces labile cis\u2013trans mixtures of enamine 3. Thermal cyclization of enamine provides a synthesis of 4(1H)-quinolone 4 (Gray et al., 1951).\nConversion of 4-hydroxyquinoline 4 to 4-chloroquinoline 6 can be carried out by a known halogenation method with POCI3 5, or other suitable reagents (e.g. SOCI2, PCI5, POBr3, PBr3). The obtained 4-chloroquinoline 6 can be converted to 4-aminoquinoline derivative 8 by an aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction with secondary amine 7. Standard bromination of quinoline 8 gives the product 10. 4-Amino-3bromoquinoline 10 can be substituted by the sodium salt of thiophenol 11 to provide compound 12. Oxidation of 4-amino3-arylsulfanylquinoline 12 can be accomplished by known methods, preferably in a suitable acid (e.g. acetic acid) at 273\u2013 278 K with potassium permanganate 15 to give 4-amino-3arylsulfinylquinolines 14 or with aqueous hydrogen peroxide 13 in a suitable acid (e.g. acetic acid or trifluoroacetic acid). To obtain the title compound 16, further oxidation of compound\n14 is required. The reaction can be carried out by known methods, preferably in a suitable acid (e.g. acetic acid) at 273\u2013 278 K with potassium permanganate 15 (Keseru\u0308 et al., 2007). The yield of the title compound is 46.0%.\nAlternative synthesis. Ethyl 2-tosylacetate 19 is obtained by the reaction of ethyl 2-bromoacetate 18 with sodium tosylsulfinate 17 in dry DMF. Compound 21 can be obtained by the condensation reaction of compound 19 with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethylacetal 20 without using a solvent or in a minimum amount of dioxane. Compound 21, upon reaction with aniline 22 in isopropanol/AcOH medium, produces an E/ Z isomer mixture of enamine 23, which is converted to 3- tosylquinoline-4-(1H)-one 24 by thermal cyclization in diphenyl ether. Chlorination of compound 24 is carried out according to a known method with phosphorus oxychloride 5. The final product 16 is obtained by the reaction of aromatic nucleophilic substitution of 4-chloro-3-tosylquinoline 25 with ethyl piperidine-4-carboxylate 7 in a dry DMF medium using a base (triethylamine, DBU), or excess of secondary amine (Keseru\u0308 et al., 2007). The yield of the title compound is 73.6%. Recrystallization by slow evaporation of a solution in acetonitrile produced block-like colorless crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis. The advantages of this synthesis make it seem preferable to the common one."

The cell esds are taken into account individually in the estimation of esds in distances, angles and torsion angles; correlations between esds in cell parameters are only used when they are defined by crystal symmetry.
