1. **Investigate the use of different feedback mechanisms:** The proposed framework uses two types of feedback: pointing-only feedback and combined verbal and pointing feedback. Future work could investigate the use of other feedback mechanisms, such as haptic feedback or gaze-based feedback. Additionally, it would be interesting to explore how different feedback mechanisms can be combined to improve the grounding performance.


2. **Apply the framework to a more complex scenario:** The scenario used in this study is relatively simple, containing only a small number of objects and a limited vocabulary. Future work could apply the framework to a more complex scenario, such as a real-world environment, to investigate how it scales to a larger number of objects and a more diverse vocabulary.


3. **Investigate the use of different unsupervised grounding mechanisms:** The proposed framework uses a cross-situational learning based unsupervised grounding mechanism. Future work could investigate the use of other unsupervised grounding mechanisms, such as Bayesian grounding or neural network based grounding. Additionally, it would be interesting to explore how different unsupervised grounding mechanisms can be combined to improve the grounding performance.


4. **Investigate the use of the framework for grounding in different modalities:** The proposed framework is designed to ground words in visual modalities. Future work could investigate the use of the framework for grounding in other modalities, such as auditory or tactile modalities. Additionally, it would be interesting to explore how the framework can be adapted to ground words in multiple modalities simultaneously.


5. **Investigate the use of the framework for grounding in different languages:** The proposed framework is designed to ground words in English. Future work could investigate the use of the framework for grounding in other languages. Additionally, it would be interesting to explore how the framework can be adapted to ground words in multiple languages simultaneously.
