Based on the provided text, the portion mentioning future research directions is as follows:

"Little information is available on the bioactivities of such acylated conjugates and how they contribute to L. siceraria health effects; thus, further studies are required to explore their potential pharmacological effect."

"Successive extraction of fruits with solvents of different polarities is recommended to further reveal phytochemical classes that require targeting, such as alkaloids and saponins."

"Whether L. siceraria has potential application in skin products comparable to that of C. sativus, with its well-reported anti-irritant, anti-acne, and skin-whitening properties has yet to be examined."

These sentences suggest areas for future research, including exploring the pharmacological effects of certain compounds, employing different extraction methods to reveal additional phytochemical classes, and investigating the potential application of L. siceraria in skin products.
