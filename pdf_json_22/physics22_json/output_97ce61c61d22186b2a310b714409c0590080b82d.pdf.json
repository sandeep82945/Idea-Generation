    "abstractText": "We show that there is a relationship between the generalized Euler characteristic Eo(|VDo |) of the original graph that was split at vertices into two disconnected subgraphs i = 1, 2 and their generalized Euler characteristics Ei(|VDi |). Here, |VDo | and |VDi | denote the numbers of vertices with the Dirichlet boundary conditions in the graphs. The theoretical results are experimentally verified using microwave networks that simulate quantum graphs. We demonstrate that the evaluation of the generalized Euler characteristics Eo(|VDo |) and Ei(|VDi |) allow us to determine the number of vertices where the two subgraphs were initially connected.",

            "text": "The concept of graphs was already introduced in the XVIII century by Leonhard Euler [1]. Two hundred years later, Linus Pauling [2] considered quantum graphs in order to describe the motion of quantum particles in a physical network. The models of quantum graphs were widely used to investigate many physical systems, e.g., quantum wires [3], mesoscopic quantum systems [4,5], a topological edge invariant [6], and the photon number statistics of coherent light [7]. Broad applications of graphs and networks mean that the theory of quantum graphs has been a subject of extensive research [8\u201314]. We will consider a metric graph \u0393 = (V, E), which consists of v vertices, v \u2208 V, connected by e edges, e \u2208 E. The edges e are intervals of the length le on the real line R. The metric graph becomes quantum when we equip it with the free Schr\u00f6dinger operator. In our case, this is the one-dimensional Laplace operator, which equals L(\u0393) = \u2212 d2\ndx2e on\neach of the edges e \u2208 E of the graph \u0393. The self-adjoint Laplace operator L(\u0393) has a discrete and non-negative spectrum [12]. A signal inside a graph moves along the edges, and at each vertex v \u2208 V it splits and enters all edges adjacent to v. If the signal enters the vertex v along the edge e\u2032 and leaves it along the edge e, then the ratio of amplitudes of entering and leaving signals is given by the vertex scattering matrix, which depends on the vertex boundary condition. We will consider two types of vertex boundary conditions. The standard boundary conditions are called also Neumann boundary conditions, for which the eigenfunctions are continuous at vertices and the sums of their oriented derivatives at vertices are zero. The vertex scattering matrix corresponding to the Neumann boundary conditions [15] is given by\nN\u03c3 (v) e,e\u2032 = 2 dv \u2212 \u03b4e,e\u2032 , (1)\nwhere dv is the degree of the vertex v, i.e., the number of edges incident to the vertex v, and \u03b4e,e\u2032 is the Kronecker delta. The vertices with the Neumann boundary conditions will be denoted as vN .\nEntropy 2022, 24, 387. https://doi.org/10.3390/e24030387 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy\nFor the Dirichlet boundary condition, an eigenfunction at the vertex takes the value zero, which leads to the vertex scattering matrix [15,16]\nD\u03c3 (v) e,e\u2032 = \u2212\u03b4e,e\u2032 . (2)\nOne should point out that the Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed only at degree one vertices and higher-degree Dirichlet vertices should be treated as separate degree one Dirichlet vertices. The vertices with the Dirichlet boundary conditions will be denoted as vD. Different types of the boundary conditions, including the Neumann and Dirichlet ones for higher-dimensional systems such as grains, are comprehensively described in Refs. [17,18]. The total number of vertices |V| in a general graph, consisting of both Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions, is defined by |V| = |VN |+ |VD|, where |VN | and |VD| denote the number of vertices with Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions, respectively. One of the most important characteristics of metric graphs \u0393 = (V, E) with the standard boundary conditions (|VD| = 0) is the Euler characteristic\n\u03c7 = |V| \u2212 |E| , (3)\nwhere |V| and |E| denote the number of vertices and edges of the graph. It is a purely topological quantity; however, it has been shown in [19\u201322] that it can also be defined by the graph and microwave network spectra. The formula describing the generalized Euler characteristic E [22,23], which is also applicable for graphs and networks with the Dirichlet boundary conditions, will be discussed later. In the experimental investigation of properties of quantum graphs, we used microwave networks simulating quantum graphs [16,24\u201329]. The emulation of quantum graphs by microwave networks is possible because of the formal analogy of the one-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger equation describing quantum graphs and the telegrapher\u2019s equation for microwave networks [24,26]. Microwave networks are the only ones that allow for the experimental simulation of quantum systems with all three types of symmetry within the framework of the random matrix theory (RMT): Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE)\u2014 systems with preserved time reversal symmetry (TRS) [16,21,24,25,27,30\u201332], Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE)\u2014systems with broken TRS [24,28,33\u201336], and Gaussian symplectic ensemble (GSE)\u2014systems with TRS and half-spin [37]. The other model systems, which are not as versatile as microwave networks, but are often used in simulations of complex quantum systems, are flat microwave billiards [38\u201354], and exited atoms in strong microwave fields [55\u201367]. In this article, we will analyze the splitting of a quantum graph (network) into two disconnected subgraphs (subnetworks). Using a currently introduced spectral invariant\u2014the generalized Euler characteristic E [22]\u2014we determine the number |Vc| of common vertices where the two subgraphs were initially connected. The application of the generalized Euler characteristic E for this purpose stems from the fact that it can be evaluated without knowing the topologies of quantum graphs (networks), using small or moderate numbers of their lowest eigenenergies (resonances). The theoretical results are numerically verified and confirmed experimentally using the spectra of microwave networks simulating quantum graphs."

            "text": "In Refs. [21,22], the formulas for the Euler characteristic for graphs with the standard boundary conditions at the vertices and with the mixed ones, standard and Dirichlet boundary conditions at vertices, were derived. In the case of the standard boundary conditions,\n\u03c7 = 2 + 8\u03c02 \u2211 kn\u2208\u03a3(Lst(\u0393))\nkn 6=0\nsin(kn/t) (kn/t) ( (2\u03c0)2 \u2212 (kn/t)2 ) |t\u2265t0 , (4) where \u03a3(Lst(\u0393)) denotes the spectrum of the Laplacian Lst(\u0393) with the standard vertex conditions, taken in the square root scale, i.e., the numbers kn are the square roots of the eigenenergies \u03bbn and t is a scaling parameter [19\u201321] with t0 = 12lmin , where lmin is the length of the shortest edge of the graph. The above formula is equivalent to Equation (3); however, instead of using topological information about graphs or networks, such as the number of vertices |V| and edges |E|, it requires a certain number of the lowest eigenenergies (resonances) of graphs or networks. For graphs and networks with the mixed boundary conditions, namely the standard and Dirichlet ones (|VD| 6= 0), the generalized Euler characteristic can be expressed by the following formula:\n\u03c7G := \u03c7\u2212 |VD| = 8\u03c02 \u2211 kn\u2208\u03a3(Lst,D(\u0393)) sin(kn/t) (kn/t) ( (2\u03c0)2 \u2212 (kn/t)2 ) |t\u2265t0 . (5) In Equation (5), the spectrum of the Laplacian Lst,D(\u0393) with the standard and Dirichlet vertex conditions is denoted by \u03a3(Lst,D(\u0393)). The above two equations can be unified into a single one for the generalized Euler characteristic:\nE(|VD|) = 2\u03b40,|VD | + 8\u03c0 2 \u2211\nkn\u2208\u03a3(L(\u0393)) kn 6=0\nsin(kn/t) (kn/t) ( (2\u03c0)2 \u2212 (kn/t)2 ) |t\u2265t0 . (6) Depending on the boundary conditions, \u03a3(L(\u0393)) denotes either the spectrum of the Laplacian Lst(\u0393) or Lst,D(\u0393). In the borderline cases |VD| = 0 and |VD| 6= 0, E(|VD| = 0) = \u03c7 and E(|VD| 6= 0) = \u03c7G, recovering, respectively, Equations (4) and (5). From the experimental point of view, the usefulness of Equation (6) stems from the fact that the generalized Euler characteristic can be evaluated using only a limited number K = Kmin of the lowest eigenvalues (resonances) [21,22,68,69]\nK \u2265 |V|+ 2Lt [ 1\u2212 exp ( \u2212e\u03c0 Lt )]\u22121/2 , (7)\nwhere |V| is the total number of graph vertices, L = \u2211e\u2208E le is the total length of the graph, and e is the accuracy of determining the Euler characteristic from Formula (7). To obtain the smallest possible number of resonances Kmin, for a given accuracy e, we assign to t its smallest allowed value t = t0 = 12lmin . Since the Euler characteristic is an integer, the accuracy of its determination should be taken e < 1/2. In our calculations of Kmin, we assumed e = 1/4."

            "text": "In order to simplify the description of the graphs, we introduce the following notation of graphs and networks \u0393(|V|, |E|, |VD|), where |V| = |VN |+ |VD|. A graph or network \u0393(|V|, |E|, |VD|) contains |V| vertices, including |VN | and |VD| vertices with standard (Neumann) and Dirichlet boundary conditions and |E| edges. We will consider a general situation when an original graph \u0393o(|Vo|, |Eo|, |VDo |) is split into two disconnected subgraphs \u0393i(|Vi|, |Ei|, |VDi |), i = 1, 2, at the common for the subgraphs vertices Vc, which are characterized by the Neumann boundary conditions. In the partition process, each common vertex v \u2208 Vc will be split into two new vertices belonging to the different subgraphs (see Figure 1). The generalized Euler characteristics of the original graph and its subgraphs are Eo(|VDo |) = |Vo| \u2212 |Eo| \u2212 |VDo | and Ei(|VDi |) = |Vi| \u2212 |Ei| \u2212 |VDi |, i = 1, 2, respectively.\nThe relationships between the number of vertices and edges of the graphs are the following: |Vo|+ |Vc| = |V1|+ |V2|, |Eo| = |E1|+ |E2|. It leads to the following relationship between Eo(|VDo |) and Ei(|VDi |), i = 1, 2\nE1(|VD1 |) + E2(|VD2 |) = Eo(|VDo |) + |Vc|+ |VDo | \u2212 |VD1 | \u2212 |VD2 |, (8)\nwhere |Vc| denotes the number of common vertices. In Figure 1, we show the case when the original graph \u0393o(|Vo| = 6, |Eo| = 9, |VDo | = 0) = \u0393o(6, 9, 0) is divided into two subgraphs \u03931(4, 6, 0) and \u03932(4, 3, 0). Using Equation (8), one can find that the subgraphs before the disconnection were connected in |Vc| = 2 common vertices. In this relatively simple situation, the generalized Euler characteristics of the graphs or networks can be found from their topological properties, i.e., the numbers of vertices and edges of the graphs. However, if we do not see the graphs and therefore do not know their topological properties but we know their eigenvalues (spectra), the only available solution to the problem is to use Equation (6) to find their generalized Euler characteristics and consequently the number |Vc| of the common vertices. The same situation exists for the graphs possessing the Dirichlet boundary conditions. In this case, in order to identify them, one needs to know (measure) the eigenvalues (resonances) of graphs or networks and use Equations (6) and (8) to evaluate the number |Vc| of the common vertices."

            "text": "In order to evaluate the generalized Euler characteristic E(|VD|) defined by Equation (6), we measured the spectra of microwave networks simulating quantum graphs. In our investigations, we used a set-up (see Figure 2) that consisted of an Agilent E8364B vector network analyzer (VNA) and HP 85133-60016 flexible microwave cable that connected the VNA to the measured network. The flexible cable connected to the network is equivalent to attaching an infinite lead to the quantum graph [22,32]. In this way, the one-port scattering matrix S11(\u03bd) of the network was measured as a function of microwave frequency \u03bd. The modulus of |S11(\u03bd)| was used to identify the network\u2019s resonances. In Figure 2, we also show the original microwave network \u0393o(6, 9, 1), which possesses a single vertex with the Dirichlet boundary condition (VDo = 1), marked by the red capital letter D. The measured spectrum of the network \u0393o(6, 9, 1) is shown in the inset of Figure 2 in the frequency range \u03bd = [0.01, 1] GHz. In order to reconfirm our experimental results, the spectra of the\nquantum graphs simulated by the microwave networks were also calculated numerically using the pseudo-orbits method developed in Ref. [31].\nIn the construction of microwave networks simulating quantum graphs, we used microwave coaxial cables and junctions that corresponded to the edges and vertices of the quantum graphs. The microwave cables consisted of an outer conductor with an inner radius r2 = 0.15 cm and an inner conductor of radius r1 = 0.05 cm, which was surrounded by the dielectric material (Teflon). The fundamental TEM mode propagates in such cables below the cut-off frequency of the TE11 mode \u03bdcut = c\u03c0(r1+r2) \u221a \u03b5 = 33 GHz [70,71], where the dielectric constant of Teflon \u03b5 = 2.06. It is important to point out that the lengths of edges of the simulated quantum graph have to be compared to the optical lengths of the edges of the microwave networks, i.e., lopt = \u221a \u03b5lph, where lph is the physical length of the network edges. In this paper, we discuss two general situations that are possible when the original network (graph) is split into two subnetworks (subgraphs): the case when the original network and its subnetworks have only the standard boundary conditions and the case when they are characterized by the mixed boundary conditions, when the Dirichlet boundary conditions are present."

In this case, all networks possess only standard (Neumann) boundary conditions, denoted with the capital letter N. The total optical lengths of the networks \u0393o(6, 9, 0), \u03931(4, 6, 0), and \u03932(4, 3, 0) are Lo = 2.579 m, L1 = 1.675 m, and L2 = 0.940 m, respectively. The lengths of their shortest edges are lmino = l6 = 0.221 m, lmin1 = l6 = 0.221 m, and lmin2 = l9 = 0.270 m, giving Kmino = 38, Kmin1 = 23, and Kmin2 = 8, respectively, which were estimated using Equation (7). Experimentally, in order to find the minimum number of resonances determined by the parameters Kmino , Kmin1 , and Kmin2 , it was necessary to measure the spectra of the microwave networks \u0393o(6, 9, 0), \u03931(4, 6, 0), and \u03932(4, 3, 0) in the frequency ranges\n[0.010, 2.347] GHz, [0.010, 2.234] GHz, and [0.010, 1.271] GHz, respectively. Taking into account the above parameters, the generalized Euler characteristics Eo(|VDo |), E1(|VD1 |), and E2(|VD2 |) were calculated using Equation (6).

The numerically found generalized Euler characteristics are marked with blue full lines. In all three cases, for both experimental and theoretical results, the plateaus at the generalized Euler characteristics start close to the points t0o = 2.26 m \u22121, t01 = 2.26 m \u22121, and t02 = 1.85 m \u22121 defined by the theory (see the discussion below Equation (7)). The values of the generalized Euler characteristics are found to be Eo(|VDo | = 0) = \u22123, E1(|VD1 | = 0) = \u22122, and E2(|VD2 | = 0) = 1, respectively. Using Equation (8), it is easy to find that |Vc| = 2. It means that, before splitting, the two subgraphs were connected at the two vertices. It is important to point out that the above information was obtained without knowing anything about the topologies of the networks."

The network \u0393o(6, 9, 1) and the subnetwork \u03932(4, 3, 1) possess a single Dirichlet boundary condition. Figure 1 shows the schemes of the networks. The Dirichlet boundary conditions are denoted by the capital letter D. All other parameters of the networks, such as the total lengths and the shortest edges, are the same as in the case of the networks with the standard boundary conditions, which were discussed above. However, for the networks with the mixed boundary conditions, one requires the same number of resonances as, in the case of the networks with the Neumann boundary conditions, the frequency ranges where they can be identified are different. For example, for the networks \u0393o(6, 9, 1) and \u03932(4, 3, 1), they are [0.010, 2.500] GHz and [0.010, 1.131] GHz, respectively.

Therefore, it might be possible to apply the properties of the splitting networks discussed in this article in some more practical applications, such as the diagnostics of electronic or microwave networks. One should underline that the first practical test of such diagnostics where the properties of splitting networks and the generalized Euler characteristic were applied was presented in this article. For this purpose, we used real-world systems, such as microwave networks. They are open and dissipative systems, which are completely different from the ideal dissipationless graphs considered in their mathematical studies. In spite of this, even for more complex networks possessing the mixed boundary conditions, we were able to find experimentally the number of common vertices |Vc| where the two separated subnetworks were connected before their splitting.\nAuthor Contributions: O.F. performed the experiment.
