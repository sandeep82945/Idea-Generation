    "abstractText": "The adoption and diffusion level of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) technology among listed enterprises is an important indicator of the capital market\u2018s openness and efficiency degree. In this study, we established an evolutionary model between the government, listed enterprises, and institutional investors, analyzed the evolutionary path and evolutionary law of the model, and conducted numerical simulations. In the numerical simulations, we discussed the impact of different parameters change on the strategic choices of the three parties, and the results show that increasing government enforcement and subsidies intensity, reducing the adoption cost for listed enterprises, increasing the incremental benefits of adoption for enterprises, and increasing the participation level of institutional investors all promote the adoption of XBRL technology by listed enterprises. The adoption behavior of listed enterprises is driven by a combination of the government\u2019s policy guidance and institutional investors\u2019 XBRL engagement level. Therefore, this paper is an effective supplement to the innovative technology adoption and diffusion theory and provides policy recommendations and management insights for the government\u2019s efforts in promoting XBRL technology, which is conducive to solving the problem of insufficient motivation for XBRL technology adoption by listed enterprises.",

            "text": "In recent years, eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) has been an electronic financial reporting data format that has been widely used in many countries and regions around the world and is gradually developing into an \u201cinternational language\u201d for electronic financial reporting [1]. As an open, cross-platform, and cross-system international standard, it can store, manipulate, reuse, and exchange all kinds of accounting and business information accurately and efficiently in real time, which is expected to solve the long-standing problem of difficulty in sharing accounting information resources due to the lack of uniform standards [2,3]. The authenticity, timeliness, and accuracy of financial reports are important preconditions for the efficient conduct of government supervision and management, enterprise financing and borrowing, investor analysis, and decision-making. XBRL is an effective technology for compiling, submitting, retrieving, and analyzing financial reports, and is also the product of the highly integrated capital market and accounting informatization. Its implementation ability and promotion level are important indicators to measure the degree of capital market openness and market efficiency [4,5]. The adoption of XBRL technology by listed companies is conducive to the healthy and sustainable development of capital markets, while at the same time, governments are faced with new issues and challenges in supervision and management, so the adoption and diffusion of XBRL technology, which has drawn great attention lately, are the main topics of this study.\nSystems 2023, 11, 197. https://doi.org/10.3390/systems11040197 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/systems\nSystems 2023, 11, 197 2 of 26\nAfter more than ten years of development, the technological advantages of XBRL technology in financial management, tax management, financial supervision, enterprise risk management, and internal control have been widely recognized in many nations and regions [6\u20139]. Meanwhile, common issues in the adoption and promotion of XBRL technology by governments and related departments are as follows: how to efficiently manage and apply financial transaction data based on XBRL technology to provide high-quality and easily accessible financial information of listed enterprises to regulatory authorities, investors, and other stakeholders, and greatly improve the economic value and social utility of XBRL related applications? To address this, XBRL technology should be widely adopted by listed enterprises. However, the government still faces the following challenges in promoting the adoption of XBRL technology by listed enterprises. Firstly, listed companies are not particularly motivated to adopt XBRL technology on their own initiative because of factors like technical complexity, implementation costs, and the risk of leaking trade secrets. Secondly, capital market regulation is inflexible, social forces are not sufficiently involved in capital market governance, and institutional investors have a low level of cognition on the advantages of XBRL and cannot resonate with and support the government\u2019s promotion of XBRL technology [10]. Institutional investors refer to financial institutions that can engage in securities investment and fund investment, including banks, securities companies, insurance companies, investment trust companies, fund companies, credit cooperatives, and other investment institutions [11]. Institutional investors are expected to have high expectations for the reform of China\u2019s capital market because they have the advantages of scale, professionalism, and information. They are also more motivated and capable of monitoring listed companies than individual investors, and they have the information and capability to participate in corporate governance [12]. In this context, the goal of this study is to investigate how the government and institutional investors may encourage the listed enterprise to embrace and disseminate XBRL technology more effectively."

            "heading": "1.2. Motivation of the Work",
            "text": "The financial reports of listed enterprises have public attributes, and the adoption of XBRL technology in listed enterprises is affected by multi-stakeholders. Stakeholders\u2019 demands for financial information disclosure are inconsistent because of their limited reasoning and attention to their interests. Listed firms, in particular, want to reveal information in their financial reports to improve their corporate image and attract investment, but they are hesitant to do so because it would require them to spend excessive amounts of money on its preparation [13]. To increase the likelihood of detecting financial fraud and malpractice as well as the cost of non-compliance, regulators are hoping that listed companies will adopt XBRL technology and produce better financial reports. This will, in turn, increase the efficiency of government regulation and further support the healthy and orderly development of capital markets [14,15]. Institutional investors rely on the information they possess to effectively lower the cost of information search, processing, and monitoring, improve investment efficiency, and increase investment returns; they expect financial reporting information to be more current, relevant, useful, and comparable [16]. It is clear from the respective demands of the three parties that there is always a game relationship between the government, listed companies, and institutional investors. To maximize their earnings, listed enterprises are motivated to develop strategies that do not actively use XBRL technology, and the degree of governmental oversight and external monitoring by institutional investors is likely to have an impact on the strategy choice of listed enterprises. To support regulatory system reform and ongoing development of the information disclosure system, it is crucial to investigate the game interaction between the three parties.\nSystems 2023, 11, 197 3 of 26\nAlthough many academics have focused more on the adoption and diffusion of XBRL technology in recent years, the research still has several limitations. First, game theory has been used to study the adoption and diffusion of XBRL technology, but much of the existing literature assumes that governments and listed enterprises are completely rational players [17], meaning that their strategic decisions are intended to maximize their interests. Yet, in practice, both governments and listed enterprises have limited informationgathering and processing capacities, and their decisions are finitely rational and influenced by their social context, experiences, and the actions of others in comparable circumstances. Secondly, most scholars only focus on the optimal strategy choice of listed enterprises and the government in a finite game [18,19], while the evolutionary path of the long-term game is rarely considered. In reality, this process is a long-run dynamic process for game players under finite rationality. Thirdly, the existing literature focuses more on the game interactions between governments and enterprises and less on the role and influence of institutional investors in the adoption and diffusion of XBRL technology, and even less on the specific distinction and discussion of different forms of government behavior and institutional investor participation [20]. In actuality, the government has an information disadvantage in the game with listed enterprises, and even if it incurs significant regulatory expenses, it will not be able to close all the flaws and gaps in the regulatory rules. Hence, institutional investors\u2019 level of capital market engagement needs to increase, and their roles in price discovery, rational investment, and external oversight need to be better played. It supports the shift in our capital market oversight from centralized management and strict management to flexible governance [21]. In summary, from the overview of XBRL technology adoption and diffusion issues, although researchers have made significant progress in this area, the following questions and challenges still need to be addressed: (1) How is the evolutionary game model between the government, listed enterprises and institutional investors constructed and formulated? (2) How do the behavioral strategies of governments and institutional investors affect listed enterprises\u2019 cost-benefit measures of XBRL adoption? (3) How can the roles of government and institutional investors in the adoption and diffusion of XBRL be clearly described?"

In addition, this study explores the impact of changes in parameters such as the intensity of government enforcement, the intensity of subsidies, the cost and benefit of adoption by listed enterprises, and the intensity of participation by institutional investors on the evolutionary path of the system through numerical simulation analysis. Contributions to this paper include the following: (1) We construct a tripartite evolutionary game model, introduce institutional investors into the model, and expand the two-party game model between the government and listed enterprises in the existing literature, which is a supplement to the existing studies on XBRL technology adoption and diffusion. (2) This paper studies the adoption and diffusion of XBRL technology from the perspectives of government law enforcement intensity, subsidy intensity, enterprise adoption costs, incremental benefits of adoption, participation of institutional investors, etc. The results have practical significance and can provide a reference for management practice.

These studies acknowledge that XBRL technology adoption depends on three groups of factors: technology, organizatio , and enviro ment. Amo g them, technical factors ref r to the characteristics of the technology itself, such as complexity, compatibility, and comparative adv ntage [25]. Organizational f ctor re ers to the organizati n\u2019s degree of cognition and ab lity to learn about and apply technology. Environmental factors emphasize the pressure that external environment may cause on the adoption of organizational technology, including normative\nSystems 2023, 11, 197 5 of 26\npressure and imitative pressure [26]. In addition, some studies have pointed out that expected income and network effects are the driving factors for enterprises to adopt XBRL technology, while the adoption cost is the inhibiting factor. If the cost is too high, enterprises will not adopt this technology [27,28]."

            "heading": "2.2. XBRL Application Effects",
            "text": "In terms of application effects, most research has relied on qualitative analysis or empirical testing techniques. The majority of academics have studied how corporations, governments, and investors will be affected by the use of XBRL. For listed enterprises, the advantages of XBRL adoption include increased transparency of information [29], decreased information asymmetry [30], and increased information about the characteristics of individual stocks, which in turn significantly increases the rate at which firm-specific information is incorporated into stock prices, ultimately leading to a reduction in stock price synchronization [31]. According to the literature [32\u201334], there is a significant inverse relationship between the adoption of XBRL technology and the cost of equity and debt financing. This is because increased information transparency lowers creditors\u2019 and investors\u2019 expectations of uncertainty regarding the future performance of listed enterprises, and voluntary adoption lowers financing costs more than mandatory adoption. The biggest supporter and beneficiary of XBRL technology is government regulators, as the standardization of financial statement data can significantly reduce the cost of data exchange and comparison and verification between regulators [35]. The adoption of XBRL technology can raise regulatory efficacy and increase the likelihood of discovering financial crime and malpractice in listed enterprises [36]. For institutional investors, XBRL financial information is more relevant, understandable, and comparable than the traditional financial reporting format, reducing the cost of information processing and monitoring for investors [37]. Institutional investors\u2019 risk expectations and subsequent investment decisions are also impacted by the way listed enterprises adopt XBRL. These investors perceive XBRL-using enterprises as being more willing to provide high-quality financial information, and they are more likely to actively evaluate these enterprises and pay more for their shares than those that do not [38,39]."

            "heading": "2.3. Strategy Choice of Stakeholders",
            "text": "In terms of strategy choice, as an important tool for studying the interaction and influence mechanism of decision-making among participants, game theory provides a general mathematical analytic method for situations with multiple participants whose decisions influence each other. However, because it assumes the complete rationality of parties, game theory has limitations in solving practical situations. For example, game relationship analysis lacks a dynamic mechanism and cannot adequately explain the selection of multiple equilibria. Evolutionary game theory, a sub-discipline of game theory, has been widely used in economic and social fields because it relaxes the assumption of complete rationality of actors. According to evolutionary game theory, players have limited rationality, with a finite knowledge reserve, reasoning ability, and information collection ability. Participants cannot respond quickly and optimally to changes, and their behavior and decision-making will be influenced by culture, experience, convention, and the choices of others in similar situations. Gamers\u2019 conduct is a constantly dynamic evolution and self-adjustment process. Therefore, evolutionary game theory has been widely used in the study of government system construction and industry regulation, market behavior analysis, and enterprise technology innovation and application. In terms of government system construction and industry supervision, Scholars have focused on the prevention and control of public health emergencies [40,41], environmental pollution control [42\u201346], urban ecological transformation [47], problem-solving for rural waste classification [48], assurance of construction safety and quality [49], and purification of cyberspace [50]. In terms of market behavior analysis, the researchers use the interaction between the market\u2019s participating agents as their subject of investigation. They then build an\nSystems 2023, 11, 197 6 of 26\nevolutionary game model to examine the significant role that the government plays in upholding market order, monitoring business compliance, and defending the interests of consumers. To address the issue of quality management in the food supply chain, Peng et al. [51] demonstrated that better government regulation, a reduction in the cost differential between the production of high- and low-quality raw food materials, and a rise in the motivation for consumers to file complaints can all contribute to more sustainable management of the food supply chain. To encourage the healthy and sustainable development of the marine sector, Gao et al. [52] created a three-way evolutionary game model comprising marine product manufacturers, local governments, and consumers. Jiang et al. [53] built an evolutionary game model of the government, developers, and home buyers to study the growth of the green residential building industry, and the results showed that the government has a dominant role in the incubation stage, but as the industry matures, this dominant role will gradually be replaced by market-driven mechanisms. In terms of corporate technological innovation and application, scholars have used evolutionary game models to analyze the long-term evolutionary process of corporate technology adoption decisions. To encourage corporate green and low-carbon technological innovation, Chen et al. [54] built a tripartite evolutionary game model with the government, businesses, and the general public. The study\u2019s findings showed that pollution taxes, low-carbon technology innovation subsidies, and environmental protection publicity guidance were three effective methods. An evolutionary game model was created by Yi and Hiroatsu [55] between the government, construction businesses, and academics around the decision of robotically automated construction technology for construction enterprises. The study showed that raising monetary and reputational rewards, as well as raising the percentage of robotically automated construction in academic evaluations, can encourage the use of new technologies in construction businesses. Scholars have used game theory to study the adoption and diffusion of XBRL technology. Wu and Liu [19] analyzed the adoption motivation and efficiency of XBRL technology by enterprises in a competitive environment and found that whether and when enterprises adopt XBRL technology will be affected by other enterprises\u2019 behaviors, and in this process, the government can play an intervention role to promote the diffusion of XBRL technology. According to Ren and Wu [18], XBRL financial disclosure involves a variety of parties, including businesses, governmental authorities, institutional investors, third-party software vendors, and so on. The adoption of XBRL technology cannot be viewed as a technological application alone but rather as a technology decision made by businesses based on a competitive market environment, which includes the interaction of many players in a game. This process is long-term and dynamic. On this basis, Pan and Xue [20] studied the mechanism of government guidance strategies on the adoption of XBRL technology by building a two-party evolutionary game model and found that reducing the cost of technology, increasing penalties, and increasing subsidies to enterprises are effective ways for governments to promote the adoption of XBRL technology."

            "text": "In conclusion, although the current research on the adoption and diffusion of XBRL technology has produced useful findings, there are still some limitations. On the one hand, the analysis of driving factors and application effects frequently employs qualitative analysis and empirical tests to study the decision-making of a single agent, but such research makes it challenging to interpret the interaction between multi-agent behavior from a global perspective. On the other hand, while some researchers have used evolutionary game theory to examine the multi-agent game equilibrium strategy in the adoption and diffusion of XBRL technology, very few studies have discovered that institutional investors, a significant player in the capital market, are included in the evolutionary game model. The improvement of the capital market\u2019s information disclosure and oversight mechanisms is currently a major global concern. The government actively participates in the regulation of the capital market through the use of market forces, such as institutional investors. The\nSystems 2023, 11, 197 7 of 26\nprocess of XBRL adoption and diffusion is a long-term, dynamic process in which multiple stakeholders in a social system interact with each other. The government, listed enterprises, and institutional investors are interrelated participants in the adoption and diffusion system of XBRL, and they all use bounded rationality, so it is completely reasonable and feasible to use evolutionary game theory to study the game interaction mechanism among them. In this paper, institutional investors are innovatively introduced into the interaction model between government and enterprises, and the adoption and diffusion mechanism of XBRL technology is discussed by constructing a tripartite evolutionary game model and providing a new theoretical basis for promoting listed enterprises to actively adopt XBRL technology and realize efficient diffusion of XBRL technology."

            "text": "The process of adoption and diffusion of XBRL technology involves multi-party interaction between the government, listed enterprises, and institutional investors. The system is complex, multi-participant, and multi-faceted in this manner. When XBRL technology spreads among listed enterprises, it is not guaranteed that individuals in the group can pursue the optimal strategy completely and rationally. Therefore, under this background, we establish a tripartite evolutionary game model of government, listed enterprises, and institutional investors to explore the evolutionary path of tripartite strategy selection. Among them, listed enterprises regularly publish financial reports for information disclosure and can choose whether to adopt XBRL technology and publish financial reports in XBRL format. The government supervises the listed enterprises and influences the technology adoption decisions of listed enterprises through administrative measures such as rewards and punishments. At the same time, the government is a public trust institution for institutional investors, and the government\u2019s publicity and guidance policies have a great impact on the behavior and decision-making of institutional investors. Institutional investors use financial reports to make investment decision analyses, form investment value judgments, and then influence the financing activities of listed enterprises. In addition, they can choose whether to participate in the diffusion of XBRL technology in the process of investment decisions and play the role of external supervision.

The model will evolve to the most beneficial strategy autonomously when game players are facing multiple strategies selection with different benefits levels. The results obtained by the dynamic replication equation can ensure that all the evolutionary stability strategies are evolutionary equilibrium. In the following, the dynamic replication equations are constructed for the government, listed enterprises, and institutional investors, and the evolutionary stability strategies of each party are analyzed in turn.\n3.4.1. Dynamic Replication Analysis of Governments\nFrom the above analysis, the dynamic replication equation for the government\u2019s choice of mandatory strategy is as follows:\nF(x) = dx dt = x(1\u2212 x)[y(\u2212\u03b2T \u2212 \u03b1P) + \u03b1P\u2212 H \u2212 zK], (10)\n(1) If z \u2261 [y(\u2212\u03b2T \u2212 \u03b1P) + \u03b1P\u2212 H]/K, F(x) \u2261 0, means that the government\u2019s strategy does not change over time regardless of whether the government chooses to make it mandatory or voluntary and despite the actual ratio of mandatory to voluntary. (2) If z 6= [y(\u2212\u03b2T \u2212 \u03b1P) + \u03b1P\u2212 H]/K, to make F(x) \u2261 0, it follows that x = 0, x = 1, means the government\u2019s choice of both a mandatory and a voluntary strategy are stable points. That is, if the government chooses the strategy of mandatory (voluntary), the government\u2019s strategy will be stable at mandatory (voluntary) as long as there are no sudden change conditions that make the government change its strategy. Derivation of F(x) leads to: dF(x)/dx = (1\u2212 2x)[y(\u2212\u03b2T \u2212 \u03b1P) + \u03b1P\u2212 H \u2212 zK], the evolutionary stabilization strategy requires F(x) = 0, dF(x)/dx < 0, and the following different scenarios are analyzed: When z < [y(\u2212\u03b2T \u2212 \u03b1P) + \u03b1P\u2212 H]/K, dF(x)/dx|x=0 > 0, dF(x)/dx|x=1 < 0, so x = 1 is the evolutionarily stable strategy point. When z > [y(\u2212\u03b2T \u2212 \u03b1P) + \u03b1P\u2212 H]/K, dF(x)/dx|x=1 > 0, dF(x)/dx|x=0 < 0, so x = 0 is the evolutionarily stable strategy point.

Replication Dynamic Analysis of Listed Enterprises\nBased on the above analysis, the replication dynamics equation for the listed enterprises\u2019 a ption strategy can be obtained in the same way:\nF(y) = dy dt = y(1\u2212 y)[x(\u03b2T + \u03b1P) + z(RE1 \u2212 RE2 + \u03d5LE) + RE2 \u2212 CE] (11)\n(1) If x \u2261 [CE \u2212 RE2 \u2212 z(RE1 \u2212 RE2 + \u03d5LE)]/(\u03b2T + \u03b1P), F(y) \u2261 0 indicates that all levels are steady state in this condition, which means that the listed enterprises\u2019 strategy does not change over time, regardless of whether they choose to adopt or not adopt and the proportion of XBRL adoption. (2) If x 6= [CE \u2212 RE2 \u2212 z(RE1 \u2212 RE2 + \u03d5LE)]/(\u03b2T + \u03b1P), to make F(y) \u2261 0, it can be derived that y = 0, y = 1, means that listed enterprises\u2019 ch ice of adoption and nonadoption strategies are stable points. That is, if a listed enterprise chooses to adopt (not to adopt) a strategy, the listed enterprise\u2019s strategy will be stable at the point of adoption (non-adoption) as long as there are no sudden change conditions that make the listed enterprise change its strategy. Derivation of F(y) leads to: dF(y)/dy = (1\u2212 2y)[x(\u03b2T + \u03b1P)+ z(RE1 \u2212 RE2 + \u03d5LE)+ RE2 \u2212 CE], the evolutionary stabilization strategy requires F(y) = 0, dF(y)/dy < 0, and the following different scenarios are analyzed. When x > [CE \u2212 RE2 \u2212 z(RE1 \u2212 RE2 + \u03d5LE)]/(\u03b2T + \u03b1P), dF(y)/dy|y=0 > 0, dF(y)/dy|y=1 < 0, so y = 1 is the evolutionarily stable strategy point. When x < [CE \u2212 RE2 \u2212 z(RE1 \u2212 RE2 + \u03d5LE)]/(\u03b2T + \u03b1P), dF(y)/dy|y=0 < 0, dF(y)/dy|y=1 > 0, so y = 0 is the evolutionarily stable strategy point. Let x0 = [CE \u2212 RE2 \u2212 z(RE1 \u2212 RE2 + \u03d5LE)]/(\u03b2T + \u03b1P), draw the evolutionary trend map of the listed enterprises\u2019 strategy as shown in Figure 4. The point in front of the split plane will evolve towards y = 1, as shown in Figure 4b, and the point behind the split plane will evolve towards y = 0, as shown in Figure 4c.\n3.4.3. Replication Dynamic Analysis of Institutional Investors\nBased on the above analysis, the dynamic replication equation for institutional investors\u2019 choice of participation strategy can be obtained in the same way:\nF(z) = dz dt = z(1\u2212 z)(xK + yRI1 \u2212 \u03d5CI), (12)\n(1) If y \u2261 (\u03d5CI \u2212 xK)/RI1, F(z) \u2261 0, indicates that all levels are steady state under this condition, which means that institutional investors\u2019 strategies do not change over\nSystems 2023, 11, 197 12 of 26\ntime, regardless of whether they choose to participate or not and the institutional investors\u2019 participation proportion. (2) If y 6= (\u03d5CI \u2212 xK)/RI1, to make F(z) \u2261 0, it follows that z = 0, z = 1, means the point at which the institutional investor chooses to participate in the strategy and the strategy of non-participation are both stables. That is, if an institutional investor chooses the strategy of participating in technology diffusion (not participating in technology diffusion), the institutional investor\u2019s strategy will be stable at participating in technology diffusion (not participating in technology diffusion) as long as there are no sudden change conditions that make the institutional investor change its strategy. Derivation of F(z) leads to: dF(z)/dz = (1\u2212 2z)(xK + yRI1 \u2212 \u03d5CI), the evolutionary stabilization strategy requires F(z) = 0, dF(z)/dz < 0, and the following different scenarios are analyzed. When y > (\u03d5CI \u2212 xK)/RI1, dF(z)/dz|z=0 > 0, dF(z)/dz|z=1 < 0, so z = 1 is the evolutionarily stable strategy point. When y < (\u03d5CI \u2212 xK)/RI1, dF(z)/dz|z=0 < 0, dF(z)/dz|z=1 > 0, so z = 0 is the evolutionarily stable strategy point. Let y0 = (\u03d5CI \u2212 xK)/RI1, draw the evolutionary trend map of the institutional investors\u2019 strategy as shown in Figure 5. The point in front of the split plane will evolve towards z = 1, as shown in Figure 5b, and the point behind the split plane will evolve towards z = 0, as shown in Figure 5c.

Stability Analysis of Equilibrium Points The above analysis of the equilibrium conditions for each subject to reach a stable strategy from the perspective of a single game subject. However, in essence, the achievement of the final stable state of the system requires the joint action of all three parties. Thus, this section will explore the equilibrium conditions for the system to evolve a stable strategy under the synergy of three parties.

            "text": "The above analysis of the equilibrium conditions for each subject to reach a stable strategy from the perspective of a single game subject. However, in essence, the achievement of the final stable state of the system requires the joint action of all three parties. Thus, this section will explore the equilibrium conditions for the system to evolve a stable strategy under the synergy of three parties. Let F(x) = 0, F(y) = 0, F(z) = 0, then eight pure strategy Nash equilibrium points of the government, listed enterprises, and institutional investors in the game can be obtained, namely E1(0, 0, 0), E2(0, 1, 0), E3(0, 1, 1), E4(0, 0, 1), E5(1, 0, 1), E6(1, 0, 0), E7(1, 1, 0), E8(1, 1, 1). The equilibrium points obtained from the dynamic replication equations are not necessarily the evolutionary stability of the system, and the stability of the resulting equilibrium points needs to be analyzed by the Jacobian matrix (denoted as J). The Jacobian matrix of the game system is as follows:\nJ = \u2202F(x)/\u2202x, \u2202F(x)/\u2202y, \u2202F(x)/\u2202z\u2202F(y)/\u2202x, \u2202F(y)/\u2202y, \u2202F(y)/\u2202z \u2202F(z)/\u2202x, \u2202F(z)/\u2202y, \u2202F(z)/\u2202z \n=  (1\u2212 2x)[y(\u2212\u03b2T \u2212 \u03b1P)+ \u03b1P\u2212 H \u2212 zK] x(1\u2212 x)(\u2212\u03b2T \u2212 \u03b1P) x(1\u2212 x)(\u2212K)\ny(1\u2212 y)(\u03b2T + \u03b1P) (1\u2212 2y)[x(\u03b2T + \u03b1P) + z(RE1 \u2212 RE2 +\u03d5LE)+RE2 \u2212 CE]\ny(1\u2212 y)(RE1 \u2212 RE2 + \u03d5LE)\nz(1\u2212 z)K z(1\u2212 z)RI1 (1\u2212 2z)(xK + yRI1 \u2212 \u03d5CI)\n (13)\nFrom Lyapunov\u2019s stability theory, the equilibrium point is the evolutionary stability point of the system when all the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix are less than zero. Taking the equilibrium point E1(0, 0, 0) as an example, the Jacobian matrix can be obtained as follows:\nJ1 = \u03b1P\u2212 H 0 00 RE2 \u2212 CE 0 0 0 \u2212\u03d5CI  (14) The eigenvalues of J1 can be obtained as \u03bb1 = \u03b1P\u2212 H, \u03bb2 = RE2 \u2212 CE, \u03bb3 = \u2212\u03d5CI .\nSimilarly, the eigenvalues of the other seven equilibrium points corresponding to the Jacobian matrix can be obtained, as shown in Table 3.\nNote: 1\u00a9: \u03b1P < H, RE2 < CE, \u03d5CI > RI1. 2\u00a9: CE < RE2, \u03d5CI > max{RI1, K}. 3\u00a9: \u03b1P > H, \u03d5CI < min{RI1, K}, CE < RE1 + \u03d5LE. 4\u00a9: K + H < \u03b1P, CE > max{\u03b2T + \u03b1P + RE1 + \u03d5LE, RE2}, \u03d5CI < K. 5\u00a9: H < \u03b1P, \u03b2T + \u03b1P + RE2 < CE, \u03d5CI > max{K, RI1}.\nAccording to the Jacobian matrix eigenvalues corresponding to each equilibrium point in Table 3, E4(0, 0, 1), E7(1, 1, 0) and E8(1, 1, 1) correspond to \u03bb3 = \u03d5CI > 0, \u03bb1 = \u03b2T + H > 0 and \u03bb1 = \u03b2T + H + K > 0, respectively, so the equilibrium points E4(0, 0, 1), E7(1, 1, 0) and E8(1, 1, 1) are unstable.

These data were manipulated to closely fit certain assumptions of this study before being used. We ranged the level of participation, subsidy, and penalty intensity from 0 to 1. For constant parameters, such as the maximum amount of government subsidy, we set five different sets of values based on five scenarios to satisfy the five scenarios assumed above and validate them.

The influ nce of \u03b1 change on the system evolution path: (a) X-Y perspective; (b) X-Z perspective.\nIt can be seen from Figure 11 that with the increase in mandatory enforcement intensity, the faster the proportion of listed enterprises choosing to adopt XBRL increases, the faster the proportion of institutional investors choosing to participate increases, which shows that government fines can effectively mobilize listed enterprises to adopt XBRL technology and can also fully stimulate the willingness of institutional investors\u2019 participation in the technology adoption and diffusion. However, even at great cost to the government, it will not be possible to close all the gaps and loopholes in the regulatory rules. So as more institutional investors become involved in monitoring, the government will gradually abandon the mandatory strategy. The pressure on listed enterprises to adopt will also gradually shift from a punitive measure by the government to an external monitoring by institutional investors."

However, even at great cost to the government, it will not be possible to close all the gaps and loopholes in the regulatory rules.

However, as more and more listed enterprises choose to adopt XBRL, it also becomes increasingly difficult for institutional investors to identify non-adopters during monitoring, and the search costs for institutional investors increase at the same time.

This is because the higher the participation intensity, the more participation costs occur, and the fewer net benefits for institutional investors, then the less motivated they are to participate. However, this does not deter institutional investors from ultimately choosing to participate; although there are costs associated with participation, it is still profitable for institutional investors.

Third, with the continuous improvement f institutional investors\u2019 participation and incremental incom brou ht by adoption, listed nterprise evolve to adopt strategies fast r, which i icates that the active participation of institutional investors ca stimulate the internal adoption motivation of listed enterprises from the capital market. Therefore, this study emphasizes the importance of institutional investors\u2019 participation in the diffusion of XBRL technology and explains the i portant role of institutional investors in promoting the adoption of listed companies from compulsory passive to voluntary active. In summary, listed enterprises may be forced to implement XBRL technology due to increased government enforcement, but this will also result in increased government regulatory pressure. More government aid can help listed enterprises with their cost burdens and encourage more listed enterprises to embrace XBRL technology. However, high subsidies will place a significant financial burden on the government, making the\nSystems 2023, 11, 197 21 of 26\nsubstantial administrative interference of the government unsustainable. The simulation findings demonstrate that lowering the adoption cost, raising incremental revenue from adoption, and expanding institutional investor participation can encourage listed firms to embrace XBRL technology. To put it another way, the only effective way to influence listed enterprises\u2019 attitudes and willingness to adopt XBRL technology is to lower the cost of adoption, encourage institutional investors to actively participate, and provide enterprises with measurable incremental economic value. This will allow XBRL technology to be effectively disseminated and applied."

            "text": "It is essential to discuss the connections with comparable works. Prior research mostly used qualitative analysis and empirical tests to examine the motivating factors for businesses to use XBRL technology as well as the effects on enterprises, governments, and investors after doing so. This served as a theoretical foundation for the explanation of the XBRL technology adoption driving drivers and application effects. However, the majority of these studies use qualitative analysis and empirical tests to study the decision-making of a single subject, making it difficult to explain the influencing mechanism of decision-making interaction among multiple subjects in the adoption and diffusion of XBRL technology from a macro and global perspective. Evolutionary game theory has advantages in studying the interaction of multiple boundedly rational players. It can help us evaluate the dynamic changing process of players\u2019 behaviors in the game system since it uses mathematical tools to analyze the cost and benefit factors underlying their strategies. Game theory has been used to study the adoption and diffusion of XBRL technology; one of the studies [21,22] used game theory to analyze the XBRL technology adoption behavior of enterprises, and their research assumption was based on the \u201ccomplete rationality\u201d of game players, which was not consistent with the objective reality. The study [24] examined the government\u2019s and the enterprises\u2019 interacting strategies in the XBRL technology adoption regulation process by building an asymmetric evolutionary game model between them. Although the \u201cbounded rationality\u201d of the game\u2019s subject was taken into consideration, it only analyzed the behaviors of the two stakeholders, the government and enterprises, in the process of XBRL technology adoption and diffusion. This study lacks interaction behavior analysis of other stakeholders. Based on evolutionary game theory, this paper integrates the research results of driving factors and application effects into the process of determining the relationship between game players, innovatively introducing institutional investors, an important stakeholder, into the model, and constructs a three-party evolutionary game model that includes the government, listed enterprises, and institutional investors. The stability of the single-agent strategy selection and the stability of the multi-agent system equilibrium strategies are examined at the micro and macro levels. Additionally, the simulation analysis of different parameter change scenarios in the model is carried out, and the impact of each changed factor on the system\u2019s evolution trajectory is intuitively analyzed to more effectively coordinate the various benefits of administrative intervention from the government and participation from institutional investors in oversight, as well as to promote the adoption of XBRL technology in the group of listed enterprises.\nSystems 2023, 11, 197 22 of 26"

            "text": "In this paper, we have established the main game mechanisms among the government, listed enterprises, and institutional investors based on the assumption of limited rationality of the participants and analyzed not only the individual evolutionary stabilization strategies under different situations but also the impact of changes in parameters such as enforcement intensity, subsidy intensity, adoption cost, incremental benefits from adoption and participation intensity on the evolutionary path of the three parties. The study\u2019s findings have significant contributions to theoretical research and management practice. The theoretical contributions of this paper are as follows: first of all, we take into account the \u201cbounded rationality\u201d traits of game players and incorporate evolutionary game theory into the study of XBRL technology adoption and diffusion, which is more accurate and provides a reference for relevant scholars studying the adoption and diffusion of innovative technology. Additionally, it extends the traditional interaction model of government enterprises to a three-party evolutionary game model that includes institutional investors as extra players to solve problems such as a lack of motivation for listed enterprises to adopt XBRL technology and a lack of obvious market feedback, and it provides a reference research method for scholars to introduce more stakeholders in the future and build game models with more than three parties. Third, the findings of this paper not only add to the theory of XBRL technology adoption and diffusion but also provide a theoretical foundation for how the government and institutional investors might encourage the adoption of XBRL technology in listed enterprises. The managerial contributions of this paper are as follows: firstly, the government\u2019s regulatory measures, as a public trust institution, will not only directly affect listed firms\u2019 adoption decisions on XBRL technology but will also directly affect institutional investors\u2019 involvement attitude and technological cognition surrounding XBRL technology diffusion. Although severe regulatory laws can cause listed firms to swiftly embrace XBRL technology, internal motivation for adoption is weak, and the majority of them are passive adopters. Secondly, regardless of the increase in law enforcement or subsidy intensity, the government is faced with a greater regulatory burden and financial pressure during the compulsory promotion process, indicating that the government cannot carry out its responsibilities healthily and sustainably in this state; therefore the government must rely on social forces to consistently improve the system of information disclosure. Thirdly, listed enterprises will fully consider the evaluation and judgment of institutional investors on their value to release favorable trading signals to the capital market and enhance their corporate image. The active participation of institutional investors in the diffusion of XBRL technology will have a direct impact on whether listed firms may receive more financing opportunities and benefit opportunities. As a result, the participation of institutional investors in oversight can effectively promote the internal incentive of listed firms to embrace XBRL technology. In summary, to fully guide the benign interaction of capital market participants and the rational allocation of resources, the government should gradually reduce the mandatory administrative intervention in the process of promoting the use of XBRL and place a premium on cultivating institutional investors\u2019 preference for the use of XBRL financial reports and raising awareness of the right to participate in supervision. Only by providing listed companies with a competitive edge in the capital market will the move from forced passive to active adoption be genuinely realized.\nBased on the findings of this paper, we make the following recommendations: Innovative ways to guide and enhance policy synergy. The government needs to\ntake a holistic approach, deeply consider the roles and interests of different stakeholders, and design multi-dimensional incentive policies to make active adoption of XBRL technology the default option for listed enterprises. On the one hand, the government should strengthen publicity and promote the construction of an XBRL data-sharing service platform to facilitate the application of data analysis by listed enterprises and investment decisions by investors through a unified and authoritative information interaction and sharing platform, increasing the probability of gaining benefits. On the other hand, the\nSystems 2023, 11, 197 23 of 26\ngovernment can encourage software vendors to develop more compatible and adaptable XBRL software to reduce technical complexity and ensure data security, providing strong technical support to listed enterprises and reducing their adoption costs at the same time. Apply a stage-by-stage mindset and move towards flexible regulation. While government mandates for listed enterprises to adopt XBRL is effective in the short term, they are not necessarily beneficial to the long-term development of the technology. The government should implement different regulatory policies based on a long-term policy plan and different stages of technology diffusion. In the early stages of diffusion, the government should adopt mandatory guidance measures to mobilize all parties in their respective roles, to avoid listed enterprises\u2019 shortsightedness, and to raise awareness among institutional investors to actively exercise their rights. When market awareness of XBRL\u2019s technological advantages becomes high enough, the government should allow market forces to guide the allocation of resources in the capital market in a reasonable and orderly manner and direct more institutional investors to participate in the diffusion of XBRL technology. These investors will be acting as a deterrent and external monitoring entity for listed enterprises, forming an effective complementary role to the government\u2019s responsibilities fulfilling tasks, and jointly contributing to the improvement of the information disclosure environment in the capital market. Combine other external forces to act collaboratively and efficiently. The government should mobilize more social forces to participate in exploring the value of XBRL applications and accordingly form a vertical chain mechanism with close cooperation and interlinking between the stock exchanges, listed enterprises, accounting firms, law firms, software suppliers, and consulting service providers. Then, all activities in the process of preparing and using XBRL financial reports can have stronger legitimacy and rationality. Ensuring the authenticity and reliability of accounting information, protecting the interests of investors while reducing the financing costs of listed enterprises, and giving better play to the role of the capital market in promoting overall economic development."

Then, we conduct numerical simulation using the MATLABR2016B software, which not only analyzes the system equilibrium results under various conditions but also analyzes the effects of the intensity of government enforcement, the intensity of subsidies, the cost of enterprise adoption, and the incremental benefit of adoption, as well as the participation level of institutional investors on the path of the system\u2019s evolution. We found that taking into account the participation of institutional investors, some of the results of this study are consistent with the findings of the two-party evolutionary game model between the government and listed enterprises [24], i.e., increasing government subsidies and enforcement intensity, reducing the adoption costs of listed enterprises, and increasing the incremental benefits of adoption by listed enterprises will promote the adoption of XBRL by listed enterprises, but increasing enforcement intensity and subsidies will harm government performance. However, increasing the intensity of enforcement and subsidies will put some regulatory and financial pressure on the government to fulfill its responsibilities. On this basis, our study further found that the government\u2019s reward and punishment policies played a leading role in the initial stage of XBRL technology diffusion, but as enterprises and institutional investors gradually complete their cognition of XBRL technology advantages, this dominant role will be replaced by an \u201cinstitutional investor-led\u201d market mechanism. In conclusion, the adoption of XBRL technology by listed enterprises is driven by a combination of government policy guidance and institutional investors\u2019 participation and oversight. In the early stages of technology diffusion, although the government\u2019s mandatory regulatory measures exerted regulatory pressure on listed enterprises, due to\nSystems 2023, 11, 197 24 of 26\nhigh adoption costs and insignificant incremental benefits, enterprises were more prone to high-pressure stress adoption and did not take much initiative, making it difficult to fully utilize the advantages of XBRL technology. As XBRL technology becomes more widespread and institutional investors\u2019 participation increases, the government will gradually reduce its mandatory administrative intervention and shift its policy focus to guiding and nurturing institutional investors\u2019 exercise of right consciousness; during this period, the economic value rewards from investors\u2019 recognition will become an internal driver of technology adoption by listed enterprises."

The simulation results validate the model\u2019s validity to some extent, but the model\u2019s applicability, in reality, must be confirmed further by collecting and bringing in real data sets. In the future, based on this theoretical analysis framework, scholars can further combine realistic data to conduct empirical tests on the model, to obtain more powerful research conclusions.
