    "abstractText": "Sponsorship describes a set of actions wherein an influential champion (sponsor) uses their position to actively support a colleague\u2019s career by helping them gain visibility, recognition, and/or positions. There is growing awareness of the importance of sponsorship for career advancement in academic medicine, particularly for women and those who are historically underrepresented and excluded in medicine (UIM). This scoping review examines the current landscape of evidence, and knowledge gaps, on sponsorship as it relates to career advancement in academic medicine for women and UIM faculty. We searched peer-reviewed literature in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science (WoS) over the past 50 years (from 1973 through July 2023). Sixteen studies were included in the final review. We found relative consensus on sponsorship definition and value to career advancement. Heterogeneity in study design limited our ability to directly compare study outcomes. All included studies focused on gender differences in sponsorship: two of four quantitative studies found men were more likely to receive sponsorship, one reported no gender differences, and one was insufficiently powered. All but one of the qualitative studies reported gender differences, with women less likely to access or be identified for sponsorship. The mixedmethods studies suggested sponsorship may vary by career stage. Only two studies analyzed sponsorship for UIM populations. The existing data are inconclusive regarding best ways to measure and assess sponsorship, what institutional support (e.g., structured programs, formal recognition, or incentives for sponsorship) should look like, and at what career stage sponsorship is most important. Addressing this knowledge gap will be critically important for understanding what sponsorship best practices, if any, should be used to promote equity in career advancement in academic medicine. We advocate for commitment at the institutional and national levels to develop new infrastructure for transparently and equitably supporting women and UIM in career advancement.",

Sponsorship has emerged as a key new approach to address and ameliorate the persistent disparities that confront women and UIM faculty in career advancement.\u00a01\u20134\u00a0Sponsorship, in this context, refers to an individual in an influential position who advocates for, guides, and provides opportunities to advance a colleague\u2019s career.\u00a05\u00a0This form of support extends beyond and is distinct from traditional mentorship, encompassing active endorsement, networking assistance, and strategic exposure to influential circles.\u00a06\u20138\nThe concept of sponsorship as a vehicle for achieving equity has garnered increasing attention in academia. Some have argued that mentorship, while essential, may fall short in addressing systemic inequities, perhaps because mentorship focuses on the professional development of the mentee but is not directly dedicated to career advancement.\u00a09\u00a0Sponsorship, on the other hand, takes a proactive approach by directly connecting their proteges or sponsees with opportunities for skill development, high-visibility projects, and access to decisionmaking forums (what is colloquially known as a \u201cseat at the table\u201d). Successful implementation of sponsorship in the corporate sector has provided promising insights into the potential of sponsorship to mitigate inequities.\u00a08, 10\u00a0Corporate data reveals that sponsorship can lead to increased representation of traditionally excluded groups in leadership positions, breaking the cycle of traditional hierarchical imbalances.\u00a06\u20138, 11, 12\u00a0Furthermore, in the business world, sponsorship has shown to be particularly effective for women and minority individuals, as it aids in overcoming structural barriers by ensuring direct exposure to influential stakeholders.\u00a06\u20138, 13\u00a0These findings underscore the need for a review of sponsorship\u2019s applicability within the unique context of academic medicine.1\nRachel Schwartz and Mia F.

Williams et\u00a0al. delved further into sponsorship experiences and perceptions using a quantitative approach. In that study, the experience of UIM faculty varied by academic rank. Familiarity and receipt of sponsorship was higher among junior UIM faculty compared to their non-UIM peers, while the inverse was true\nat the associate and full professor levels. Regarding delivery of sponsorship, more full-professor faculty reported serving as sponsors than their non-UIM peers; the same was not true at the assistant level. They also found that among the total faculty sample, a significant proportion perceived inequities in the receipt of sponsorship for UIM faculty members."

Studies highlighted the burgeoning awareness, and importance, of sponsorship\u00a05, 35 and noted that the lack of awareness of sponsorship limits the ability to seek it.\u00a035\u00a0There appears to be a lack of training in sponsorship, despite the recognized importance for faculty career advancement.\nOur review highlights the need for more equitable and pro-active sponsorship of women in medicine in order to achieve gender diversity in career advancement and leadership representation. The data are inconclusive regarding the most important career stage(s) for sponsorship intervention, but the patterns observed in our review suggest differences in both the prevalence and impact of sponsorship for women. Notably, our scoping review did not yield any articles that provided descriptions of formal sponsorship programs or intensity/dose of sponsorship.\nOur review found a limited landscape regarding the influence of sponsorship on UIM cohorts, as only two of 16 studies directly addressed this phenomenon. A diverse workforce is critically important for improving patient care,\u00a038\u00a0creative work,\u00a039\u00a0and scholarship.\u00a040\u00a0Mentorship helps to support increased diversity,\u00a041\u201343\u00a0but the goal goes beyond increasing diversity to supporting more equitable opportunities\nFigure\u00a02 Studies\u2019 proposed interventions for addressing inequity in sponsorship.\nfor career advancement, which many of the articles in the current review suggest requires, or at the very least, is significantly facilitated by sponsorship.

Multiple studies referred to sponsorship as \u201cepisodic\u201d or \u201ctransactional\u201d; however, it is evident from the description of effective sponsorship behaviors that acts of sponsorship rely on the sponsor recognizing the abilities and potential of a sponsee and vouching for the sponsee\u2019s professional abilities. This type of recognition requires more than superficial knowledge of a person, and potential risk to the sponsor\u2019s reputation if the sponsee performs poorly. Several articles in our review highlighted the \u201cloyalty\u201d required of the sponsee, which also suggests an ongoing relationship and commitment, even if the frequency of contact may be low. More attention to the relational precursors to sponsorship is needed to understand how best to develop and foster sponsorship in academic medicine and to ensure it helps to promote more, not less, diversity of opportunity and leadership.\nLimitations. Our findings are limited by a relative paucity of research on sponsorship; this may in part be due to the nature of sponsorship, which often happens behind closed doors, making it difficult to track and quantify.\u00a035\u00a0Increasing awareness and actions of sponsorship requires educating those in a position to sponsor others about its value in providing career advancement opportunities, particularly for those who come from backgrounds that have been historically excluded from leadership positions. While most articles reported on the career stage of participants, the interaction between receipt\nof sponsorship and career stage was not routinely reported, limiting our ability to draw conclusions. Finally, this scoping review may not have captured original research that did not contain an abstract or include \u201csponsorship\u201d in the title."

            "text": "Although sponsorship research is nascent and still evolving, the evidence presented here demonstrates that sponsorship matters for career advancement in academic medicine for women and those who have been historically underrepresented and excluded in medicine (UIM). Leaders must commit themselves to creating a culture of sponsorship, as many have for mentorship, in order to address the current lack of diversity in leadership and equitable support for career advancement for those faculty and trainees who have historically been excluded from these opportunities. We advocate for commitment at the institutional level for program support and training, and at the national level for funding to develop, implement, and assess the impact of sponsorship programs for women and UIM faculty in academic medicine. This process will require individuals in positions of influence to reflect on how they approach sponsorship vis a vis equity, and develop new infrastructure for equitably supporting women and UIM in career advancement. Such initiatives may include new, transparent practices for leadership opportunities, and developing new networks for proactively sponsoring those who our data show are unlikely to seek it for reasons unrelated to their competence and potential.\nCorresponding Author: Rachel Schwartz, PhD; Department of"
