China\n5Department of Physics, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, China\nAntiferromagnetic (AF) transitions of birefringent Dirac fermions created by a Y -shaped Kekule\u0301 distortion in graphene are investigated by the mean-field theory and the determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the quantum critical point can be continuously tuned by the bond-modulation strength, and the universality of the quantum criticality remains in the Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg class. The critical interaction scales with the geometric average of the two velocities of the birefringent Dirac cones, and decreases monotonically between the uniform and the completely depleted limits. Since the AF critical interaction can be tuned to very small values, antiferromagnetism may emerge automatically, realizing the long-sought magnetism in graphene. These results enrich our understanding of the semimetal-AF transitions in Dirac-fermion systems, and open a new route to achieve magnetism in the graphene.\nIntroduction. Graphene features linear dispersions near the Fermi energy [1, 2], which is described by a massless Dirac equation. The electrons therein are thus called Dirac fermions, which have been the origin of various exotic properties [3\u20135]. While theoretical studies have suggested abundant topological or ordered phases in graphene, as generated by various kinds of mechanisms [6\u201312], their experimental observations are lacking due to the overall weak correlation effects in graphene.\nAchieving magnetism in graphene is actively pursued in the hope of its spintronic applications. Although pristine graphene has a non-magnetic ground state, magnetic orders have been observed at the zigzag edges, defects, and hydrogen-terminated vacancies [13\u201320]. The emergent magnetism is generally related to the associated localized states [21], for which the correlation effect is greatly enhanced, resulting in magnetic ordering at much weaker interactions [22\u201324]. From this physical mechanism, it is clear that the above magnetisms are restricted to specific regions of graphene, e.g., edges or defects. Up to now, inducing a robust long-range magnetic order in the bulk of graphene remains a challenge.\nIn this work, we propose that the Y -shaped Kekule\u0301 distortion can induce a global antiferromagnetic (AF) order in graphene. Our work is motivated by the recent experiments which successfully realized such distortion in graphene grown on Cu(111) [25] and on transition metal dichalcogenides substrates [26]. We show that the Y - shaped bond texture modifies the Fermi velocities of two pairs of low-energy bands differently, creating birefringent Dirac fermions. AF transitions of such fermions are investigated by two complementary methods: the mean-field theory and the large-scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations. Both methods\npredict a SM-AF transition, and find that the critical interaction is proportional to the geometric average of the two velocities of birefringent Dirac fermions. The DQMC simulations quantitatively determine the critical values using finite-size scaling. Besides, it is found that the quantum criticality remains in the Gross-NeveuHeisenberg universality class. Our results show that the Y -shaped distortion enables an additional degree of control of Dirac fermions, and provides a new way to tune the quantum critical point. Importantly, we reveal that when the distortion strength is large enough, the critical interaction may be well below the actual value of U/t in graphene [27, 28], generating global AF long-range order. Considering the recent progress in engineering the Y -shaped Kekule\u0301 distortion [25, 26], our result provides a feasible approach to realize magnetic graphene in experiment.\nModel. Our study is based on the Hubbard model defined on a honeycomb lattice with a Y -shaped Kekule\u0301 distortion:\nH = \u2212 \u2211 \u3008ij\u3009\u03c3 tij(c \u2020 i\u03c3cj\u03c3 + H.c.) + U \u2211 i ni\u2191ni\u2193, (1)\nwhere c\u2020i\u03c3 and ci\u03c3 are the creation and annihilation operators, respectively, at site i with spin \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193; \u3008ij\u3009 denotes nearest neighbors; ni\u03c3 = c \u2020 i\u03c3ci\u03c3 is the number operator of electrons; and U is the on-site repulsion. Due to the Y -shaped modulation, the hopping amplitudes are modified as tij = (1 + 2\u2206)t or (1 \u2212 \u2206)t, depending on the position and direction of the bond (see Fig. 1(a)), where \u2206 \u2208 [\u22120.5, 1]. The modifications are defined in such a way to keep the total band width more or less unchanged. The pristine honeycomb lattice is restored at \u2206 = 0. In the limit \u2206 = \u22120.5, the 5th site in each unit cell is com-\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n05 74\n4v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\ntr -e\nl] 1\n3 Se\np 20\n22\n2 1 2 3 4 5 6\ny\nx\n~a1\n~a2\n(a)\nt\u2212 = (1\u2212\u22060)t0 t+ = (1 + 2\u22060)t0 M \u0393 K M\n\u22123 \u22122 \u22121\n0\n1\n2\n3\nE /t\n(b)\n\u22060/t = 0.0 \u22060/t = \u22120.4\n\u0393 M\nK\n1BZ\nFIG. 1. (a) Honeycomb lattice with a Y -shaped bond modulation. Black and white dots label the two sublattices, and black and red lines distinguish different bond strengths. The different sites in the unit cell are marked by a set of integers (1 \u2212 6). (b) The energy spectrum along the high-symmetry directions of the Brillouin zone at \u22060/t = 0 and \u22120.4. Inset of (b) is the 1st Brillouin zone with the high-symmetry points labeled.\npletely isolated from the lattice (see Fig. 1(a)), generating a 1/6-depleted honeycomb lattice. This is similar to the Lieb lattice (also known as 1/4 depleted square lattice) [29]. \u2206 > 0 interchanges the strong and weak bonds as in the \u2206 < 0 case, and the lattice is completely broken into isolated four-site stars at \u2206 = 1.\nUnder the Y -shaped distortion, the lattice has a sixsite unit cell (see Fig. 1(a)). Let\u2019s first neglect the interaction term in (1), then the electronic band structure contains six dispersive bands, as shown in Fig. 1(b). By a Brillouin zone (BZ) folding process, the bands of the \u2206 = 0 case in such a plot can be obtained from the pristine graphene band structure, where the two inequivalent Dirac points at the corners of the BZ are folded to the \u0393 point and the Dirac cones will coincide. For \u2206 6= 0, although the linear dispersions remain near the Dirac points, the Dirac cone degeneracy is lifted, generating birefringent Dirac fermions with two different Fermi velocities, as in Fig. 1(b). By projecting the full Hamiltonian to the low-energy space at \u0393, an effective Hamiltonian can be deduced [30]. The energy spectrum contains four branches with E = \u00b1 32 (1\u2212\u2206)tk and E = \u00b1 32\u03b1(1 \u2212 \u2206)tk, with \u03b1 = 1+2\u2206\u221a1+2\u22062 . The two Fermi velocities are respectively given by\nv1 = 3\n2 (1\u2212\u2206)t, v2 =\n3 2 \u03b1(1\u2212\u2206)t. (2)\nIt is noted that v2 becomes zero in two limits: \u2206 = \u22120.5 or 1, generating two or four flat bands at the Fermi energy. When \u2206 approaches the above two limits, the low-energy bands will be flattened, and the corresponding states tend to localize on the sites connected by the weakened bonds. Then, the correlation effect in the low-energy bands will be enhanced, and we expect that the AF critical interaction will be significantly reduced. This expectation will be explored by two theoretical approaches, as we demonstrate below.\n0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 U/t\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n\u03c1 i\n(a)\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\nn c\n0 2 4 6 U/t\n0.00\n0.03\n0.06\n0.09\nS z A F /N\n(b) \u22060/t=\u20130.5\n\u22060/t=\u20130.4 \u22060/t=\u20130.3 \u22060/t=\u20130.2 \u22060/t=\u20130.1 \u22060/t=\u20130.0\nFIG. 2.

Within the mean-field approximation, the interacting term Uni\u2191ni\u2193 is decoupled in the density channel as [31\u201333] ni\u2191ni\u2193 \u2248 ni\u2191 \u3008ni\u2193\u3009 + \u3008ni\u2191\u3009ni\u2193 \u2212 \u3008ni\u2191\u3009 \u3008ni\u2193\u3009. To incorporate the possible AF order, the averages of the operators are written as\n\u3008ni\u2191(\u2193)\u3009 = 1\n2 \u00b1 \u03c1i, for i \u2208 {1, 3, 5}, (3)\nand\n\u3008ni\u2191(\u2193)\u3009 = 1\n2 \u2213 \u03c1i, for i \u2208 {2, 4, 6}, (4)\nwith \u03c1i being the order parameters, where i labels the six sites in a unit cell. We consider equal number of spin-up and spin-down electrons, such that the following restriction applies on the six order parameters: \u03c11 +\u03c13 + \u03c15 = \u03c12 + \u03c14 + \u03c16, which means only five of them are independent.\nIn the momentum space, the mean-field Hamiltonian is then\nHMF = \u2211 k\u03c3 \u03c8\u2020k\u03c3H\u03c3(k)\u03c8k\u03c3 + E0 (5)\nwith\nH\u03c3(k) = ( h\u03c311 h12(k)\nh\u202012(k) h \u03c3 22\n) , (6)\nwhere \u03c8k\u03c3 = (c1,k\u03c3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , c6,k\u03c3)T is a six-element basis, h\u03c311 = \u2213diag(\u03c11, \u03c13, \u03c15), h\u03c322 = \u00b1diag(\u03c12, \u03c14, \u03c16), and the constant E0 = NU/4 +NU \u22116 i=1 \u03c1 2 i /6 with N the total number of sites. The order parameters \u03c1i in the ground state can be calculated by minimizing the total energy from the mean field Hamiltonian.\nAlthough the order parameters \u03c1i are generally different within the unit cell due to the inhomogeneous bond textures, their curves as a function of U have the same features. Hence, we use their arithmetic mean,\n3 \u22120.4 \u22120.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 \u22060/t 0 1 2 3 4 U c/ t AF SM \u03b1 \u221a \u03bd1\u03bd2 MFT DQMC\nFIG. 3. The phase diagram in the (\u22060, Uc) plane. The dashed line represents the mean-field boundary, which underestimates the critical interaction. The DQMC critical values can be well fitted using the ansatz Uc = \u03b1 \u221a \u03bd1\u03bd2, implying the critical interaction is proportional to the geometric average of the two velocities of the Dirac cones.\n\u03c1 = 16 \u22116 i=1 \u03c1i, to characterize the AF transition. Figure 2(a) shows \u03c1 as a function of U for various values of \u2206 at zero temperature. The values of \u03c1 keep almost zero at weak interactions, and the system is in the semimetal phase. After passing a critical interaction Uc, \u03c1 becomes finite, and increases rapidly with U , suggesting the AF order develops in the system. As the absolute value of \u2206 increases, the curves move leftward, indicating that the critical interaction decreases monotonically with increasing \u2206.\nSince the curves of \u03c1 is continuous, it is not straightforward to determine Uc. Here, we use the critical slowing down at the phase transition to determine Uc. Specifically, the self-consistent process becomes the slowest at the transition point, which is reflected in the maximum cycling time nc to get convergent self-consistent results. We checked that the critical value at \u2206 = 0 obtained by this method is in good agreement with the previous study [34]. Our result is shown in Fig. 3. One finds that the critical interaction of the semimetal-AF transition decreases monotonically from Uc/t = 2.23 at \u2206 = 0 to Uc/t = 0 at \u2206 = \u22120.5. Similarly, Uc also decreases monotonically with \u2206 for \u2206 > 0 [30].\nDQMC approach. In the DQMC approach, Eq. (1) at finite interactions is solved numerically, where one decouples the on-site interaction term through the introduction of an auxiliary Hubbard-Stratonovich field, which is then integrated out stochastically [35\u201338]. The only errors are those associated with the statistical sampling, the finite spatial lattice size, and the inverse temperature discretization. These errors can be well controlled in the sense that they can be systematically reduced as needed, and further eliminated by appropriate extrapolations. At half filling, the simulation is free of\nthe sign problem, due to the presence of particle-hole symmetry [39\u201342]. Thus we can access low enough temperatures, necessary to determine the ground-state properties on finite-size lattices. In our calculation, we use the inverse temperature \u03b2 = 20 and its discretization \u2206\u03c4 = 0.1. The lattice has totally N = 6 \u00d7 L \u00d7 L sites, with L up to 8.\nApplying DQMC to our problem, the antiferromagnetic order is characterized by the staggered structure factor [43] with\nSzAF = 1\nN \u2211 i,j sgn(i, j)\u3008Szi Szj \u3009, (7)\nwhere sgn(i, j) = +(\u2212) when i, j belong to the same (opposite) sublattice. Since the Hubbard model in Eq. (1) preserves the spin SU(2) symmetry, so the spin-spin correlations of the three spin components are identical, and we only consider the z-component here. A related physical quantity of interest here is the sublattice magnetization, which is given by ms = \u221a SzAF/N .\nFigure 2(b) shows calculated m2s as a function of U on a L = 6 lattice for various negative values of \u2206. At \u2206 = 0, it is known that AF order exists when U exceeds Uc = 3.86 [44\u201349]. In the \u22060 = \u22120.5 limit, the geometry corresponds to the 1/6-depleted honeycomb lattice, where AF order is expected to exist for all U > 0, due to the existence of flat band. The behavior of m2s versus U is qualitatively similar for different values of \u2206: m2s increases continuously with U , thus the semimetal-AF transition is of second-order nature. In addition, as \u2206 increases, the curves shift to the weak-interaction side, which results from the decrease of the critical interaction Uc as the absolute value of \u2206 increases. These confirm the observation from the mean field approach.\nTo gain additional insight into the behavior of AF order, it is useful to examine the equal-time real space spinspin correlation function c(r) = \u3008(nj+r\u2191 \u2212 nj+r\u2193)(nj\u2191 \u2212 nj\u2193)\u3009. Figure 4 shows c(r) for \u2206 = \u22120.3 at U/t = 2, 4 on a L = 6 lattice. The origin is placed on the 1st site of the unit cell at (0, 0), and r runs along a triangular path (see Fig.4(a)). Since U/t = 2 is below the critical interaction (Uc/t = 2.85, see the following finite-size scaling), the values of the correlation at large distance are almost zero. On the other hand, the correlation length becomes comparable to the system size for the case of U/t = 4. c(r) has a robust persistence at large distance, and its sign is consistent with AF order. This behavior is consistent with the fact that U/t = 4 is above the critical point, and there exists AF order in the system. The sites in the lattice can be classified into three categories according to the number of the weakened bonds connected. c(r) varies among the different kinds of pairs of sites, which is most pronounced in the large-U limit. As shown in Fig. 4(d), it increases with the total number of weakened bonds connected to the two sites in each pair, exhibiting\n4 an interesting behavior: The less the site is connected to the lattice, the stronger it is correlated to other sites.\nThe behavior of SzAF indicates that AF order may develop at a decreased critical interaction in the presence of Y -shaped bond modulation in going from the pristine honeycomb lattice to the limiting cases of \u2206 = \u22120.5, 1. We then use finite-size scaling to analyze quantitatively the position of the critical point in the thermodynamic limit. The square of the order parameter is given by SzAF/N in the 1/L \u2192 0 limit. These extrapolated values are shown in the phase diagram Fig. 3. As a function of \u2206, the critical interaction strength continuously decreases from Uc/t = 3.869 to zero. Besides, we use the ansatz Uc = \u03b1 \u221a v1v2 to fit the boundary, and find that the critical values are well fitted with \u03b1 = 2.51. This shows that the critical interaction is proportional to the geometric average of the two velocities of birefringent Dirac fermions. This relation is not known in previous studies on the uniform honeycomb-lattice and \u03c0-flux Hubbard models, because the velocity there keeps a constant [49]. Here, the birefringent setup allows a continuous tuning of the velocities, thus providing understanding on the relationship between the critical interaction and the Dirac velocities. It is also noted that when the value of \u2206 is large enough, the critical interaction can be well below the actual U value in graphene, resulting in the emergence of AF order.\nWe also perform a finite-size scaling analysis based on the usual scaling formula [50],\nSzAF = L 2\u22122\u03b2/\u03bdF [L1/\u03bd(U \u2212 Uc)], (8)\nwhere \u03b2 is the order parameter exponent, and \u03bd is the correlation length exponent.

(a) Extrapolation of the structure factor SzAF /N near the transition point. The solid lines are least-squares fits to the polynomial form of 1/L. The value in the thermodynamic limit becomes finite at some interaction between U/t = 2.8 and 2.9, thus the critical interaction is estimated to be Uc/t = 2.85\u00b10.05. (b) The data collapse using the critical exponets of the Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality class and the critical interaction determined in (a). Here the anisotropic parameter is \u22060/t = \u22120.3.\ntion is expected to belong to the Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality class [51, 52]. The previous DQMC studies reported \u03bd = 1.02 and \u03b2 = 0.76 [47]. Together with the critical interaction determined by the finite-size scaling above, we scale SzAF at different lattice sizes according to the above formula. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the data collapse is pretty good, thus confirming the universality class of the phase transition here is unchanged by the Y -shaped Kekule\u0301 distortion.\nIn addition, we have further checked the singleparticle gap by extracting the spectral function and the density of states from the imaginary-time Green function using analytic continuation [30]. It shows that the AF transition is always accompanied by a charge-gap opening, indicating that the system becomes a AF Mott insulator above Uc.\nDiscussion. We have applied the mean-field theory and DQMC simulations to study the Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice with a Y -shaped distortion. Both approaches reveal that AF order develops above a critical interaction, and the critical interaction decreases monotonically with the distortion parameter, and scales with the geometric average of the two velocities of the birefringent Dirac fermions. We find that the quantum criticality of the continuous AF transition is unchanged by the distortion and still belongs to the Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality class.\nThe fact that the Y -shaped Kekule\u0301 distortion can continuously tune the quantum critical point is of great significance in graphene research and applications. When the critical point is put below the actual value of U in graphene [27, 28], the long-sought bulk magnetism in graphene can be realized. Recent experiments [25, 26] have demonstrated the realization of Y -shaped distortion in graphene. For graphene on Cu(111), the distortion is\n5 likely due to regular copper vacancies which lead to a vertical shift of the central carbon atom of each Y -shape texture [25]. Our result indicates that when the shift is large enough, AF order should be spontaneously generated in the graphene layer. Thus, our results not only deepen our understanding of the semimetal-AF transitions in Dirac fermion systems, but also provide a feasible approach to induce magnetism in graphene.\nAcknowledgments.

Another advantage of this kind of choice is that the bandwidth is independent of the sign of \u22060.\nWhen \u22060 varies from 0 to\u22120.5, the bandwidth of the two bands near the Fermi energy decreases continuously, and becomes vanished at \u22060/t = \u22120.5. The evolution of the bandwidth is similar in changing \u22060 from 0 to 1. The difference is that the band-flatting process involves the four bands near the Fermi energy here."

In addition, as \u22060 increases, the curves shift to the weak-interaction side, thus the critical interaction Uc should decrease as \u22060 increases. The above behavior is consistent with the phase diagram of the main text.

Here the lattice size is L = 6, and the inverse temperature is \u03b2 = 20.\nlarge U . It should result from the collapse of the AF order at strong U for large \u22060, where an AF to Y -dimer transition occurs.\nFigure A7 plots the spin-spin correlation function between different kinds of pairs of sites as a function of \u22060. The largest distance between the two sites in each kind of pair is considered, which can represent the long-range spin correlation. Figure A7(a) shows c(r) in the region \u22060 < 0. The 1st, 2nd, and 5th sites in each unit cell are connected by zero, one, and three weakened bonds, respectively. The values of the spin correlations have the following relation: c5\u22125(r) > c2\u22122(r) > c1\u22121(r). For c(r) between the sites with different indexes, the relation of the corresponding values is: c2\u22125(r) > c1\u22125(r) > c1\u22122(r).

A7. The spin-spin correlations as a function of \u22060 between the sites with the same and different indexes of the unit cells in the regions: (a) \u22060 < 0; (b) \u22060 > 0. Here r takes the largest distance in a L = 6 lattice, and the strength of the interaction is U/t = 6.\nc(r) increases with the total number of weakened bonds connected to the two sites in each pair, which remains valid when all the values in Fig.A7(a) are compared. This suggests the spin correlation between two sites can be strengthened by locally weakening the bonds connecting them. As \u22060 increases, the values of the spin correlations without the 5th index involved continuously increases and tends to constants in the \u22060/t = \u22120.5 limit. The sequence of the values keeps as c2\u22122(r) > c2\u22121(r) > c1\u22121(r). In contrast, the spin correlations involving the 5th site begin to decrease quickly from \u22060/t \u223c \u22120.3, and becomes zero at \u22060/t = \u22120.5, which is expected since the 5th site is completely depleted from the lattice in this limit. As demonstrated in Fig.A7(b), the case with \u22060 > 0 is similar, except that all values begins to drop at \u22060/t \u223c 0.5, and becomes zero at \u22060/t \u223c 0.7. Here the vanishment of the spin correlations at extremely large \u22060 is due to the occurrence of an AF to Y -dimer transition.\nIn the large-U limit, the double occupancy is completely eliminated, and the Hubbard model in Eq.(1)\n10\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 \u22060/t\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\nc( r)\n1-1 1-2 2-2 2-5 5-1 5-5\nFIG. A8. The spin-spin correlations as a function of positive \u22060 for the largest distance on a L = 20 lattice in the large-U limit.\nmaps onto the following Heisenberg model[53],\nH = \u2211 \u3008ij\u3009 JijSi \u00b7 Sj , (S10)\nwhere the exchange coupling is Jij = 4t2ij U . Corresponding to the Y -shaped modulations of the hopping amplitudes, the value of Jij takes J1 = 4(1 \u2212\u22060)2/U or J2 = 4(1 + 2\u22060)\n2/U . We set J1 = 1 for \u22060 < 0 (J2 = 1 for \u22060 > 0) as the energy scale, thus J2 = (1+2\u22060)\n2/(1\u2212\u22060)2 (J1 = (1\u2212\u22060)2/(1 + 2\u22060)2), which decreases monotonically as \u22060 changes from 0 to \u22120.5(1).\nSimilar to the plot in Fig.4(d) of the main text, we here plot the spin-spin correlations at the largest distance on a L = 20 lattice as a function of positive \u22060 in the large-U limit. Now the 1st, 2nd, and 5th sites in each unit cell are connected by there, one, and zero weakened bonds, respectively. The values of the spin correlations have the following relation: c1\u22121(r) > c1\u22122(r) > c2\u22122(r) > c5\u22121(r) > c2\u22125(r) > c5\u22125(r). Hence the statement that the value of c(r) increases with the total number of weakened bonds connected to the two sites in each pair, remains valid. Different from the case of \u22060 < 0, the value of c(r) begins to be zero at \u22060/t = 0.5, where an AF to Y -dimer transition occurs. Near the critical point, c(r) decreases rapidly, implying the AF order collapses quickly with increasing \u22060 here."
