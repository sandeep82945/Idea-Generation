    "abstractText": "In this work, a new and efficient composite LDH with high adsorption power using layered double hydroxide (LDH), 2,4-toluene diisocyanate (TDI), and tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (THAM) was designed and prepared, which was used as an adsorbent to adsorb diazinon from contaminated water. The chemical composition and morphology of the adsorbent were evaluated using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) techniques. Also, the optimal conditions for adsorption of diazinon from water were determined by LDH@TDI@ THAM composite. Various parameters like the effect of adsorbent dosage, pH, concentration and contact time of diazinon were studied to determine the optimal adsorption conditions. Then, different isotherm models and kinetic adsorption were used to describe the equilibrium data and kinetic. Also, the maximum adsorption capacity is obtained when the pH of the solution is 7. The maximum adsorption capacity for LDH@TDI@THAM composite was 1000 mg/g at 65 \u00b0C and the negative values of \u0394G indicate that the adsorption process is spontaneous. After that, studying the reusability of LDH@TDI@THAM composite showed that the removal of diazinon by LDH@TDI@THAM was possible for up to four periods without a significant decrease in performance.",

The chemical composition and morphology of the adsorbent were evaluated using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) techniques. Also, the optimal conditions for adsorption of diazinon from water were determined by LDH@TDI@ THAM composite. Various parameters like the effect of adsorbent dosage, pH, concentration and contact time of diazinon were studied to determine the optimal adsorption conditions. Then, different isotherm models and kinetic adsorption were used to describe the equilibrium data and kinetic. Also, the maximum adsorption capacity is obtained when the pH of the solution is 7. The maximum adsorption capacity for LDH@TDI@THAM composite was 1000 mg/g at 65 \u00b0C and the negative values of \u0394G indicate that the adsorption process is spontaneous. After that, studying the reusability of LDH@TDI@THAM composite showed that the removal of diazinon by LDH@TDI@THAM was possible for up to four periods without a significant decrease in performance.\nToday, the widespread use of pesticides for pest control and agricultural development, as well as improper wastewater disposal has led to surface and groundwater pollution, hence removal and Adsorption from water resources is very important1\u20134. Chemical pesticides enter surface and groundwater sources through various means such as direct washing of pesticides, sewage disposal, agricultural drainage water, erosion and air, which threatens human health and the environment, thus leading to there has been considerable concern5\u20139.Various techniques that have been studied to remove pesticides from contaminated water include coagulation/flocculation/sedimentation, membrane filtration, adsorption, and advanced oxidation processes, and biodegradation10\u201316. Each of these proposed methods is less considered due to disadvantages such as high investment costs, poor performance and secondary pollution and is used in a limited way in wastewater treatment17\u201319. Hence, absorption has received considerable attention because of simple efficiency, use on a large scale, regenerative capacity, and cost of removing contaminants from water20,21. Today, organophosphate pesticides are widely used around the world for pest control due to the ban on the use of organochlorine insecticides22,23. Organophosphate compounds are one of the broad and diverse groups of toxic compounds that include pesticides. Organophosphate pesticides are relatively volatile and are very dangerous as neurotoxins to humans and animals. Diazinon with the formulation of O,O-diethyl O-[6-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl)-4-pyrimidinyl] phosphorothioate can be used as an organophosphate insecticide for eliminating flies and mites in a variety of plant and ornamental products in agriculture and home because of its low cost and high efficiency24\u201327. The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified it as a second-class pesticide in terms of toxicity28\u201330. Diazinon is one of the inhibitors of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Therefore, its removal from water resources is very important. The highest permissible concentration of this pesticide in drinking water is 0.1\u00a0\u00b5g/l, which is higher than this limit and has destructive effects on living organisms31.\nOPEN"

Also, Among the various types of methods mentioned, adsorption due to simplicity, biocompatibility and high efficiency as a more appropriate method of removing diazinon from water sources has received much attention. Hence, in the past decades, various adsorbents such as magnetic materials37, carbon nanotubes38, silica particles39, organic porous polymers40 and nano-adsorbents41,42 have been reported to remove diazinon.\nTwo-dimensional nanomaterials of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with sheet-like structures due to their various desirable properties have many applications in various fields43\u201350. LDHs as a new and widely used class of natural or synthetic anionic mineral layered nanomaterials with the formula [M2+(1\u2212x) M3+(x) (OH)2]x+ An\u2212x/n. yH2O where M2+ is a divalent metal ion (Zn2+, Cu2+, Mg2+, etc.), M3+ is a trivalent metal ion (V3+, Ga3+, Al3+, etc.), and An is an anion. The charge density of LDH layers (CO23\u2212, NO\u22123, Cl\u2212) is x = M3+/M2+ + M3+, which is between 0.2 and 0.33 for pure LDH47,51.\nAdsorbents based on layered double hydroxide (LDH) have provided a new path for the design and preparation of new adsorbents for the degradation of pollutants52,53. These adsorbents because of their very good physical and chemical properties, adjustable interlayer distance, high anion exchange capacity, wide light absorption range, special layer structure, ease of synthesis, low cost and recyclability have special place among the adsorbents54.\nTherefore, in this work, according to the mentioned contents about the importance of removing diazinon insecticide from aqueous solutions, an efficient and reusable adsorbent with good adsorption capacity was designed and prepared. Also, a facile approach is used to fabricate an environmentally-friendly composite adsorbent comprising LDH and organic compounds for the removal of organophosphate insecticide contaminants (e.g. diazinon). The components of this novel composite as absorbent include tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (THAM) grafted on the surface of LDH by organic bridges (2,4-toluene diisocyanate). THAM and 2,4-toluene diisocyanate (TDI) groups placed on the surface and between the LDH layers have increased the adsorption capacity on the LDH surface by increasing the functional groups effective (NH2, OH, and aromatic rings) in diazinon absorption. Hence, the composite prepared (LDH@TDI@THAM) here was used as a strong adsorbent with high adsorption capacity to remove diazinon insecticide from aqueous solutions. The performance of the synthesized nanocomposite has been investigated by changing various factors such as dye concentration, removal temperature, pH, adsorbent dose, and adsorbent recyclability. The isotherms and adsorption kinetics of fabricated composite have been also investigated to show the effect of LDH@TDI@THAM composite on the adsorption of diazinon."

The successful synthesis of LDH@TDI@THAM composite was confirmed by different techniques such as FTIR, EDX, XRD, FESEM, and TGA.\nFigure\u00a01 shows FTIR spectra obtained for both the Zn\u2013Al LDH and LDH@TDI@THAM composite. The adsorption band at 3425\u00a0 cm\u22121 related to the stretching vibration of O\u2013H bond (Fig.\u00a01a). The adsorption bands at 1616 and 1356\u00a0 cm\u22121 are related to the bending vibration of H\u2013O\u2013H in water and interlamellar nitrate anions. The absorption bands between 879 and 475\u00a0 cm\u22121 are attributed to the vibration of M\u2013O bonds (M can be Al or Zn)55.\nThe FTIR spectrum of LDH@TDI@THAM composite is shown in Fig.\u00a01b. The band at 3328\u00a0 cm\u22121 corresponds to the vibration of the OH in LDH, and THAM while the band at 2973\u00a0 cm\u22121 is related to the stretching vibration of C\u2013H bond in THAM. In addition, the adsorption bands at 1735\u00a0 cm\u22121 and 1654\u00a0 cm\u22121 can be attributed to the stretching vibration of carbonyl in ester and amide groups in the composite, respectively. The bands between 1036 and 559\u00a0 cm\u22121 belong to the Metal-O and Al\u2013OH bonds.\nFigure\u00a01.

Also, Fig.\u00a03a, there are symmetrical and sharp reflections at 2\u03b8 of 14.80\u00b0, 17.55\u00b0, 24.04\u00b0, 31.25\u00b0, 35.59\u00b0, 39.30\u00b0, 47.75\u00b0, 57.99\u00b0, and 63.01\u00b0, respectively, which determine the structure of Zn\u2013Al LDH56.\nIn addition, The XRD pattern of LDH@TDI@THAM composite is shown in Fig.\u00a03b, which approves the existence of Zn\u2013Al LDH along with other components of the prepared composite. The peaks related to Zn\u2013Al LDH can be clearly seen at 12.80\u00b0, 19.14\u00b0, 26.47\u00b0, 29.98\u00b0, 36.27\u00b0 and 60.54\u00b0 which is the displacement of the peaks due to its composite with THAM. The well-known amorphous halo at 2\u03b8 = 20\u201330\u00b0 clearly confirms the amorphous nature of THAM in the synthesized composite.\nFESEM images of Zn\u2013Al LDH and LDH@TDI@THAM composites are shown in Fig.\u00a04. As can be seen FESEM images Zn\u2013Al LDH shows regular and stacked hexagonal plates (Fig.\u00a04a and b). In addition, images c\u2013f show the morphology of the prepared composite. this images can clearly be seen to increase the diameter of the composite plate compared to raw LDH. Therefore, due to the placement of other components of the composite next to the LDH, the final structure has been created in the form of irregular plates with a larger diameter. This irregularity and increase in diameter can indicate that the composite has been prepared successfully.\nUsing TGA analysis, the thermal stability of LDH@TDI@THAM composite was investigated (Fig.\u00a05). TGA curve shows two weight reductions in the region of 100\u2013150\u00a0\u00b0C and 200\u2013480\u00a0\u00b0C, the first decrease is related to the removal of water and solvent molecules absorbed between the layers and the surface of the composite. Also, the second reduction that occurred in the region of 200\u2013480\u00a0\u00b0C is related to the decomposition of the organic parts of the prepared composite structure. In addition, the curve from the temperature of 480\u00a0\u00b0C has a constant slope, which is related to the mineral parts (Zn\u2013Al LDH) of the composite.\nAdsorption experiments. Experiments were performed for checking the effect of important adsorption parameters including concentration, adsorbent dose, temperature, time, and pH on diazinon pesticide adsorption in LDH@TDI@THAM composite.

(1) and (2):\ndiazinon concentration (Co (mg/L)), equilibrium concentration of diazinon (Ce (mg/L)) value of sorbent (W (mg)) and volume of diazinon solution (V (L)).\nEffect of concentration. Next, to find out the optimal concentration of diazinon, 1\u00a0mg of absorbent was added to 25\u00a0mL of solution having various concentrations of diazinon (10\u201350\u00a0mg/L) with pH = 7 at 25\u00a0\u00b0C for 60\u00a0min. Afterward, filtration was applied to separate the adsorbent from the solution. The absorption was analyzed by using UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer at wavelength of 247\u00a0 nm. The obtained values for the maximum absorption showed that the concentration of 40\u00a0 mg/L can be considered as the optimal concentration for diazinon absorption (Fig.\u00a06).\n(1)Removal % = (C0 \u2212 Ce)\nC0 \u00d7 100\n(2)qe = V(C0 \u2212 Ce)\nW\nFigure\u00a04.

Different amounts of the adsorbent (1\u20139\u00a0 mg) were used to investigate the absorption of diazinon pesticide in the presence of LDH@TDI@THAM composite. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 7, the adsorption capacity of diazinon decreases when the amount of the adsorbent increases from 1 to 9\u00a0mg. Therefore, this decrease in the adsorption capacity of diazinon by LDH@TDI@THAM composite is due to the accumulation of adsorbent particles, followed by less access to the active sites of the adsorbent. Thus, by increasing the value of LDH@TDI@THAM composite, the number of empty sites available for diazinon absorption, hence, leads to a decrease in diazinon absorption.\nEffect of temperature. In various temperatures (25, 40, 65, 80, and 90\u00a0\u00b0C), the effect of temperature on capacity of Zn\u2013Al LDH composite for diazinon adsorption was investigated (Fig.\u00a08). As can be seen in Fig.\u00a08, adsorption capacity decreases by increasing the temperature from 25 to 40\u00a0 \u00b0C. At temperatures higher than 40\u00a0\u00b0C, the adsorption capacity further decreases, indicating the exothermic nature of diazinon adsorption on the LDH@TDI@THAM composite adsorbent.\nEffect of time. Adsorption kinetics of diazinon absorption with an optimal amount of adsorbent (i.e., 1\u00a0mg) at pH 7 was investigated at different times (15, 30, 60, 90, and 120\u00a0min). Figure\u00a09 shows in equilibrium time (60\u00a0min), diazinon has the highest adsorption capacity owing to the presence of more vacancies on the LDH@ TDI@THAM composite surface. Also, with the time increases from 60 to 120\u00a0min, the adsorption capacity of diazinon decreases. This reduction in absorption is probably due to the formation of a single layer of diazinon on the LDH@TDI@THAM composite surface. In addition, it is possible that this decrease is due to insufficient free space for absorption after equilibrium is reached. It can be seen that the adsorption capacity increases by further increasing the adsorption time from 15 to 60\u00a0min. Therefore, 60\u00a0min was chosen as the optimal contact time.\nInfluence of solution pH. Figure\u00a010 shows the dependence of diazinon absorption on the pH of the solution. Diazinon absorption was measured at different pH (1\u20139) to determine the optimal pH value. As can be\nFigure\u00a05.

Also, decreasing or increasing the pH from 7 will decrease the absorption capacity.\nKinetics study. Diazinon absorption kinetics was investigated in the presence of 1\u00a0mg of adsorbent, concentration 40\u00a0mg/L, time 60\u00a0min, temperature 40\u00a0\u00b0C, and pH 7. Stirring of the mixture was performed for 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120\u00a0min. In addition, the solutions were filtered to confidence the absence of adsorbents. For analyzing the kinetic data of diazinon adsorption, pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models were applied according to Eqs. (3) and (4), respectively.\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n0 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008 0.01\nDose (mg)\nQ (m\ng/ g)\nFigure\u00a07.

Various kinetic models related to diazinon adsorption are summarized in Fig.\u00a011 and Table\u00a01. The correlation coefficient (R2) of pseudofirst-order (a) and pseudo-second-order models (b) for LDH@TDI@THAM composite was 0.9956 and 0.9988, respectively. Therefore, the results show that the adsorption of diazinon on LDH@TDI@THAM composite follows the pseudo-second-order kinetic model.\nAdsorption isotherms. Freundlich (Eq.\u00a0 5), Langmuir (Eq.\u00a0 6), and Temkin (Eq.\u00a0 7) isotherms were also applied for more check the diazinon adsorption on LDH@TDI@THAM composite.\n(3)log(qe \u2212 qt) = logqe \u2212 ( K1\n2.303\n)\nt\n(4) t\nqt =\n1\nK2q2e +\n(\n1\nqe\n)\nt\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\n1000\n1100\n1200\n0 2 4 6 8 10 PH\nQ (m\ng/ g)\nFigure\u00a010.

It can be seen that Freundlich isotherm shows higher correlation coefficient (R2) than Langmuir and Temkin isotherms, which indicates that the diazinon adsorption on the LDH@TDI@THAM composite is more compatible with the Freundlich isotherm. Also, the maximum adsorption capacity at 40\u00a0\u00b0C was 1000\u00a0mg/g (Table\u00a02).\nThermodynamic investigation. The adsorption mechanism was further studied by calculating different thermodynamic parameters (\u0394S\u00b0, \u0394H\u00b0, and \u0394G\u00b0) for diazinon adsorption on LDH@TDI@THAM composite using Eq.\u00a0(7) and Eq.\u00a0(8).\nwhere T (K) is the temperature and R is the gas constant. Figure\u00a013 and Table\u00a03 briefly show the thermodynamic parameters related to diazinon adsorption in LDH@TDI@THAM composite. The obtained results clearly confirm the exothermicity of the diazinon adsorption process on the LDH@TDI@THAM composite (\u0394H\u00b0 = \u2212 4.157\u00a0kJ/ mol). This value for \u0394H\u00b0 confirms physical adsorption of diazinon on LDH@TDI@THAM composite. Also, the value obtained for \u0394S\u00b0 is indicative of high tendency of LDH@TDI@THAM composite for diazinon adsorption.\nAdsorption mechanism. Figure\u00a014 shows the absorption mechanism of diazinon pesticide removal using LDH@TDI@THAM composite. It is evident that the structure of the LDH@TDI@THAM composite contains three functional groups: OH, NH, and aromatic ring. Hence, the adsorption of diazinon may be due to hydrogen bonding between amine groups and electron-rich oxygen and electrostatic interaction. Also, the LDH@TDI@ THAM composite contains benzene rings that can form \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions with the benzene ring of diazinon.\nRecycling studies. Reusability and stability for adsorbent materials during the adsorption process is an important factor. Thus, to investigate the reusability of LDH@TDI@THAM composite to remove diazinon in a mixture of NaCl (0.1\u00a0M) and HCl (0.1\u00a0M) as a detergent agent. For this reason, a mixture of NaCl (0.1\u00a0M) and HCl (0.1\u00a0M) was used to wash the LDH@TDI@THAM composite, followed by drying at 80\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0h. Therefore, according to Fig.\u00a015, reusability of the LDH@TDI@THAM composite was investigated for four consecutive periods.

The unique characteristics of LDH@TDI@THAM composite including simple preparation method, reusability, low cost, and high adsorption capacity have made this adsorbent superior to other adsorbents reported previously.\n(8)lnKd = S\nR \u2212\nH\nRT\n(9) G\u25e6 = H\u25e6 \u2212 T S\u25e6\nModels LDH@TDI@THAM composite\nPseudo-first-order\nqe (mg/g) 70.79\nk 0.02\nR2 0.9956\nPseudo-second-order\nqe (mg/g) 1000\nk 0.001\nR2 0.9988\n9 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:10215 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-37070-8\n0.001\n0.006\n0.011\n0.016\n0.021\n0.026\n0.031\n0 5 10 15 20 Ce (mg/L)\nC e/q\ne\n(a)\n4.5\n5\n5.5\n6\n6.5\n7\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\nLn Ce\nLn q\ne\n(b)\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\n1000\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\nq e (m\ng/ L)\n(c)\nFigure\u00a012.
