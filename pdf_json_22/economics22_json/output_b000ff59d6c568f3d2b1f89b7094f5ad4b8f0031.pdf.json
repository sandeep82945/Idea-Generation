The increase rates are 17.4 and 23.1 Tg C decade\u20121 under RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 scenarios, respectively.\nShrubland can sequester approximately 28 Tg C yr\u22121 at baseline, but the C sequestration\nwill sharply decrease to approximately 11 Tg C yr\u22121 in the 2050s (Table S3) due to a reduction of area under target-oriented managements (TOMs). The decrease rates are 3.3 and 3.1 Tg C decade\u20121 under RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 scenarios, respectively. Carbon sequestration in grassland can be 18.0 Tg C yr\u22121 in the 2010s, and increase to 27.5\u201330.5 Tg C yr\u22121 in the 2050s. Part of this increase is attributed to the TOMs implementation, with contribution of 13.9% in the 2020s and 30.5% in the 2050s to the total C sequestration (Table S4).\nCropland soils can sequester C at a rate of 43.1 Tg C yr\u22121 in the 2010s, and 52.6\u201358.4 Tg\nC yr\u20121 in the 2050s (Table S5). Crop residue retention and the expansion of no-till management play a key role in improving C sequestration, contributing a total of 10.8% in the 2010s and 48.6% in the 2050s to respective C sequestration. Wetland soils can sequester 30.5\u201342.8 Tg C yr\u22121 between 2010s\u20132050s (Table S6), 2.7\u201321.7% of which is attributed to wetland restoration."

We assumed that SOCDCK is the current cropland\u2019s SOC density (37.4 Mg C ha\u22121) in the 0\u201330 cm depth [132]. Eqn. (S9) suggests that the restored wetland SOC sequestration in the 15th year since restoration is 2.2-fold as much as in the control. We further assumed that the soil C sequestration after 15 years since restoration will follow the sequestration rate in natural wetlands since the SOCD (0-20cm) in wetland soils is about twice as in cropland soils [102].\nTable S10 shows a summary of variables in the existing estimates and site-specific\nobservations with corresponding reference and necessary information.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nsr/article/9/8/nw ac057/6554264 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\n8\nFig. S1.
