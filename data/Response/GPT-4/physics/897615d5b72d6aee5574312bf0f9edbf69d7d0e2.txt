Incorporating Capsomer Surface Charge Variations: Expanding the model to systematically vary the charge distribution on the capsomer surface could provide deeper insights into how electrostatic interactions influence capsid assembly and stability. This research could explore the interplay between steric attractions, capsomer deformability, and electrostatic repulsion in governing self-assembly, particularly in environments with varying ionic strengths.

Exploring Environmental Conditions and External Stimuli: Investigating how external conditions such as pH, temperature, and ionic strength affect the assembly process could lead to a better understanding of viral capsid formation in diverse biological contexts. Additionally, studying the impact of external stimuli like light or magnetic fields on capsid assembly could open up new avenues for controlled assembly and disassembly, with potential applications in drug delivery and nano-robotics.

Heterogeneous Capsomer Systems: Extending the model to include systems with more than one type of capsomer, varying in size, shape, or interaction properties, could reveal insights into the assembly of more complex viruses or the formation of novel nanostructures. This could also lead to understanding how minor proteins or peptides incorporated into capsids affect virus assembly and infectivity.

Dynamic Modulation of Capsomer Interactions: Designing models where the strength of capsomer-capsomer interactions or capsomer deformability can be dynamically modulated in response to specific signals could simulate the assembly process more realistically. This research could help in designing smart materials that mimic virus assembly/disassembly for therapeutic or material science applications.

Experimental Validation and Application: While the paper focuses on simulations, future research could aim at experimental validation of the model predictions using in vitro assembly systems. This would not only validate the theoretical models but also potentially lead to the development of synthetic viral capsids for vaccine design, drug delivery systems, or as templates for nanomaterial synthesis. Exploring the use of designed capsomers that can assemble into specific structures under controlled conditions could have wide-ranging applications in medicine and nanotechnology.
