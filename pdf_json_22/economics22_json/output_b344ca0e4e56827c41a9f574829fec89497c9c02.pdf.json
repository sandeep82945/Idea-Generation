    "abstractText": "Background and aim: Being the major source of revenue and essential economic tool for policymakers to improve public health, taxes contribute to government spending on the development of health care facilities and services. Given the financial challenges facing the health sector together with the public health issues that affect each society, placing specific taxes on some goods, services, and activities can be effective in this regard. The study aims to explain the various dimensions of specific taxes in the health sector and management of these resources in order to achieve the health system goals. Materials and methods: This study with a qualitative research design was conducted using semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions in 2020\u20132021. In total, 38 managers, policymakers, economists, key experts, and other individuals, as informants, were interviewed. Purposive and snowball with maximum variation was also employed. As well, content analysis was utilized to shed light on the data. The transcribed interviews were further imported into MAXQDA for extracting and classifying the relevant codes. Findings: In this study, 5 main themes and 23 subthemes were labeled. The main themes accordingly included \u201cObjectives and Conditions of Specific Health Taxes\u201d, \u201cEarmarked Taxes\u201d, \u201cTaxes on Goods and Measures of Harmful to Health\u201d, \u201cValue-Added Taxes\u201d, and \u201cGreen Taxes\u201d. Discussion and conclusion: Considering the specific taxes in the health sector, i.e., taxes on goods and measures of harmful to health, value-added taxes, and green taxes, all taxation and pricing policies need to take account of the effects as well as the advantages and disadvantages of types of taxes, a country\u2019s economic structure, the conditions of industries and manufacturing enterprises, cultural aspects in society, and peoples\u2019 socioeconomic status.",

            "text": "As a sustainable and stable financial resource that is less affected by political and economic events, taxation plays an important role in financing government measures, including health programs [1, 2]. As well, an efficient and fair tax system is vital for the continuity of governments\u2019 activities [3, 4]. By levering taxes, governments can also finance spending and take further steps toward meeting three main goals, including: economic stability, resource allocation, and revenue distribution. For example, they can reduce demands for the production of some specific goods, particularly unnecessary and even harmful ones, by putting taxes on them. In this way, governments can influence consumer behavior by taxation [5]. Therefore, among the many sources of government revenues, taxes are thus the most acceptable and logical ones [6, 7].\nAfter oil, taxes in Iran are the most important source of government revenue. In recent years, the share of tax revenues in total government revenues has increased significantly. However, the tax system in Iran suffers from\n*Correspondence: hdargahi@sina.tums.ac.ir\n2 Department of Health Management and Economics, School of Public Health, Health Information Management Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nproblems such as lack of comprehensive tax information system, complexity of the tax system, low executive capacity and weak economic structure [8]. In most countries, tax revenues are the main source of financing and development of health systems. For every $ 100 more per capita in tax revenue each year, about $ 10 per capita in health spending increases [2]. But Iran\u2019s position in this index among the countries of the world is not appropriate [9]. Although taxes are known as important economic tools for policymakers to improve public health [10], at the same time, the taxes on harmful goods and measures in Iran is not very significant and effective. For example, the total share of tobacco taxes as a percentage of retail price is only 21.7% [11]. However, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), this amount should be 70% to be effective [12].\nOn the other hand, How to provide sustainable financial resources is further today one of the challenges facing health policymakers, which is increasing day by day following the growing needs for public services in different countries, on the one hand, and financial constraints, on the other hand [13]. Tax revenues can be used for health care expenditures or to offset other sources of revenue for governments [14, 15].\nThe governments purpose of specific taxes is primarily to discourage the consumption of unhealthy products, and then to generate revenue [16]. The use of taxes for a healthier lifestyle is of interest to scientific and academic centers [17], and the WHO has recommended the use of these financial instruments [18\u201320]. Taxes and subsidies are considered in health policies, because unhealthy products are not economically affordable by increasing the price, and as a result, the incentive to consume these products reduce, or by decreasing the price of healthier products, their consumption becomes economically affordable and increases [21].\nTaxation brings major benefits to the development of the health sector; for example, establishing a health system based on tax revenues can guarantee equal and equitable access to health care facilities and services by all segments of society. Taxes can be similarly utilized as a lever to control harmful goods or as an incentive to improve health systems in different countries [22].\nEvidence also shows that taxes levied on harmful goods as well as rising prices have thus far reduced consumption rates so that, for every 10% growth in the prices of such products, their total consumption has dropped to 4 and 8% in developed and developing countries, respectively [23].\nIn a study in Vietnam in 2018, increasing taxes on tobacco, including cigarettes, had significantly diminished the adverse effects of the use of these substances, and prevented the loss of $57 billion of the country\u2019s resources [24]. A 2016 survey in South Africa had similarly demonstrated that taxation, especially Value-Added Taxes (VATs),\non sugary drinks, could prevent about 72,000 deaths and 550,000 years of healthy living lost due to stroke. Such policies could also reduce health expenses by $5 billion [25].\nIf the main goal of health tax policy is to reduce the consumption of unhealthy goods, the price of products should increase by 20% or more. However, when taxes change health behaviors, the predictability of the revenue flow is reduced [26]. Due to the social, economic and health harms associated with harmful products, attention has been paid to the ability of taxes to raise the costs of manufacturing, distribution, retail or consumption of these products, which can reduce their consumption [27].\nTheoretically, taxes on polluting industries and activities along with environmental standards have thus far provided a suitable tool for controlling and compensating for external costs caused by pollution from various organizations and factories, as well as reducing pollution and emissions to an appropriate level in a steady manner [28]. In a study in Iran (2017) the results showed, health expenses due to reduced air pollution had significantly dropped following the rise in green tax rates [29]. It was also shown in an article in the UK (2011) that taxation could have a significant effect on the consumption of environmentally polluting goods by increasing the prices of goods [30].\nIn addition to having significant health benefits, tax policies can be used to increase public health budgets. These policies encourage healthy behaviors by modifying incentives to prevent disease and making better lifestyle choices, which have significant effects for expenditures of public health and private sector [31].\nGiven the insufficient funds allocated to providing health care facilities and services and even the ignorance about tax revenues, especially specific taxes, in many countries, amending the existing laws to limit tax evasion and develop tax incentives can be among the tactics to reduce financial problems and prevent the incidence of diseases in society [32]. Therefore, the present study examines the obstacles and problems, as well as the strategies for absorption, allocation, and use of specific health taxes.\nThe health system should provide the necessary financial resources to provide facilities related to the health of various people in society, especially the needy [33], and specific taxes such as taxes on harmful goods and measures, VATs and green taxes, are the most important and sustainable of these resources.\nIn order to increase the effectiveness of specific health taxes, legislation should be done in a proper way. Legislation in Iran is mainly done by the parliament. The plans and bills, after the approval of the Parliament, must be approved by the Constitutional Council in order to become law. Next, the president signs the enacted law and provides it to relevant organizations and ministries for implementation [34].\nGiven the financial challenges facing the health sector and the public health issues that affect this society, imposing specific taxes on many goods, services, and activities makes it possible to deal with such problems in this regard. So far, there has been no research in Iran on specific taxes related to the health sector and even no attempt in the other countries examining all the important aspects of specific taxes in the health sector, so the present study was significant in this sense. The objectives of this study are examining and explaining various aspects of specific taxes in the health sector, including VATs, taxes on harmful goods and measures, and green (or environmental) taxes, and the management and use of tax resources related to the health sector. As a result, the challenges standing in front of the health sector, particularly the problems of financing and distribution of financial resources could be firstly reduced, and secondly, public health status could be improved by tackling some difficulties in the healthcare sector, especially through minimizing the incidence of diseases in society and providing proper access to health care facilities and services for all. Policymakers, lawmakers, managers, economists, experts and researchers in the fields of health, taxation, general sector economics, and environment are the most important audiences of this study. In this research, questions were asked about the goals, effects, problems and strategies for absorption and allocation each of the specific taxes related to health, and how to use these taxes."

In total, 38 managers, deputies, policymakers, economists, and key experts were interviewed upon obtaining their consent. The information about the interviewees\u2019 place of employment and demographic information, are illustrated in Tables\u00a01 and 2. Purposive and snowball sampling with maximum variation was also employed. Accordingly, the interviewees were selected by the researcher as well as suggestions by previous interviewees, because they needed to either have a certain feature of a phenomenon or rich information about a particular case [36]. Convenience sampling was used to recruit participants. The interviews also continued until saturation was reached with regard to the collected data.\nDue to the research conducted in Iran and the available samples, as well as the difficulty of interviewing experts from other countries, all interviewees were selected from Iran.

Ultimately, the final guide and interview questions were developed. Naturally, the topics that were more closely related to the individuals\u2019 expertise, responsibilities, and knowledge were questioned in each interview and evaluated in detail.\nThe most important questions was asked from the interviewees in this study, include the following:\n\u2013 Do you think the current rate of taxes on harmful products such as tobacco and cigarettes, sugary foodstuff, fatty foodstuff, soft drinks and other carbonated beverages, etc. is appropriate? If not, why? \u2013 How can we impose a higher VAT or a separate tax on the products and practices that have greater negative effects on public health and give the revenue to the healthcare system?\n\u2013 Are the current green tax rates, especially for highly polluting industries, appropriate and deterrent enough for preventing or reducing environmental damages and whether they contribute to public health? If not, why? \u2013 Upon receiving appropriate tax revenues, what should be the priorities of the Health sector in using the received resources? (If possible separately for taxes on harmful goods and measures, VAT and green tax)\nThe interviews were conducted in a semi-structured manner with open-ended questions; in this way, first, general questions were addressed to start the interview, and then, the interview process was oriented based on the respondents\u2019 answers. The interviews were further conducted based on having a prior appointment and choosing a location by the interviewees over a period of 9 months. Thus, after coordination, most of the interviews were conducted at the respondents\u2019 workplace and some were completed by phone calls as wished by them. The topics of the interview sessions were also recorded with the permission of the interviewees and then transcribed verbatim. The interviews were also transcribed immediately after the end of each session in order to become aware of the data saturation time and increase their accuracy. Out of 38 interviews, 32 and 6 cases were conducted in person and by phone calls, respectively.\nConsidering that all the interviewees were from Iran, the interviews were conducted in Persian. After transcribed, categorizing and coding the interviews, the final text was translated into English by a reputable translation agency. Then, the translated text was also checked by the researchers of this study."

Moreover, individuals\u2019 financial capability in the income groups and the effects of imposing taxes on consumption during different periods needed to be taken into account.\nAlso, the examples of taxes on products with impacts on health must be identified in a correct manner and according to the reality of society.

One way to combat products with impacts on health is the correct administration of taxes on them. Taxes should be such that their effects on reducing consumption rates and the incidence of diseases are tangible.

            "text": "Specific health taxes contribute to sustainable financing in the health sector and improve public health by changing habits and modifying lifestyle patterns. All ministries and agencies must thus play a significant role in absorbing, allocating, and making the best use of specific health taxes, so the required legislation, proper planning and implementation, as well as periodic monitoring must be done in this regard. According to the interviews in this study, five main themes were established, including \u201cobjectives and conditions of specific health taxes\u201d, \u201cearmarked taxes\u201d, \u201ctaxes on goods and measures of harmful to health\u201d, \u201cVATs\u201d, and \u201cgreen taxes\u201d.\nThe study results accordingly revealed that taxes were one of the most important sources of revenue that could be exploited in the health sector. In Nadri and Khodabakhshi study [39], taxes revenues had similarly led to significant positive effects on health expenditures in Iran. Thus, through taxes we can help improve health indicators in society and solve the problems facing the health system, especially providing health care facilities and services and meeting medical expenses.\nA systematic review of the research on health taxes indicated that policy actors need to be clear about the primary goal of any health tax and frame the tax accordingly [27]. Sustainable financing, changing health-related behavior in society, providing, maintaining, and promoting health, and reforming the health sector structure were also among the most important goals of specific health taxes addressed in this study.\nEarmarked taxes include the separation of all or part of tax resources, in order to be allocated to a specific purpose in the health sector. Many countries use dedicate resources, to mobilize resources and finance the health sector. According to the World Health Organization, more than 80 countries use earmarked resource [40]. Earmarked taxes have requirements that Modeling in line with existing conditions and localization, prioritized allocation and consumption of resources according to the facts and transparent spending, are the most important of these requirements. Also, performance accountability, accurate and continuous monitoring and follow-up and executive guarantee system, are very important for the establishment of specific taxes.\nThe resources for specific health taxes should be thus allocated in a balanced manner to all organizations and agencies involved in the health system, and unquestionably, the authority and supervision of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education in the health sector should be maintained. Establishing a fund called the Health Tax Fund was thus one of the suggestions mentioned in this study.\nIn recent years, many countries have imposed new or higher taxes on a broader array of harmful goods, or have structured taxes in new ways with the aim of increasing the cost of manufacturing, distributing and consuming these goods. For example, since 2010, countries such as Denmark, Hungary, Finland, France, Mexico and the United Kingdom, have imposed taxes on the sale of unhealthy foods and beverages [41].\nThe effects of taxes on harmful goods such as cigarettes, sugars, high-fat substances, and alcohol, according to the results of this study, could be positive but some considerations needed to be observed. Imposing taxes could typically increase the prices of harmful products and decrease their consumption rates, resulting in fewer health threats. In a 2017 study in Australia, obesity in the general population had fallen by 1.96% with a 20% tax on sugary drinks. In addition to boosting economic productivity, these changes had also saved 35,000 years of life and reduced $425 million in health expenses [42]. Another research (2008) in the United States had further found constructive evidence that higher taxes had moderated smoking by older adults, especially those with less education and living in low-income families [43].\nEvidence shows that tobacco taxation policies play an important role in achieving significant health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), especially among the poor, as well as help reduce poverty [44\u201349]. In 2012, Powell et\u00a0al. had shown that pricing tools could be considered and evaluated as potential policy tools to pursue health risk factors [50], which were consistent with the findings of the present study.\nIn taxation, individuals\u2019 financial capability in the income groups and the effects of imposing taxes on consumption rates in different periods, as well as the elasticity of goods should be taken into account. On the other hand, the examples of taxes on goods and measures harmful to health must be identified correctly and according to the reality of society. Excise taxes generally result in higher prices for consumers, reducing demand for taxed products. The size of the reduction and whom prices most affect depend on consumers\u2019 price elasticity of demand [16]. According to the WHO and the United Nations, taxes on harmful goods should be increased to reduce the consumption of these goods [51, 52]. This approach is important, because consumption patterns are influenced by purchasing prices [53].\nSin taxes represent one way of raising revenue and, through that, creating fiscal space (FS) [54]. These taxes have significant benefits, especially on health consequences [55, 56]. According to Partyka et\u00a0al. [57], sin tax, if implemented properly, could help change consumer behavior and thus positively affect public health. Sin taxes also can reduce the consumption of unhealthy goods and\ngenerate more revenue [58]. Evidence has shown that the application of these taxes can have a significant effect on consumption patterns and population welfare [59]. The present study correspondingly showed that specific taxes in the health sector, could lead to sustainable financing and improve public health by increasing the prices of goods and services.\nGiven their unique nature, VATs could also have significant effects on economic stability and financial regulation compared with other taxes. The effects of such taxes, especially on health-threatening goods and industries could include sustainable financing for the health system and reducing the consumption rates of harmful products and actions, thereby moderating health expenses as well as improving production processes and renovation of production lines. In this sense, Keen and Lockwood [60] had further found that the application of VATs had boosted productivity and efficiency in most of the countries that have adopted them.\nBased on the results of the present study, different VAT rates could be set on goods and services affecting health. In setting the taxes and determining the rates of VATs, the reform of consumption patterns and production processes should be considered. In Seyed Nourani et\u00a0al. [61], it had been also suggested to reflect on two optimal VAT rates according to the type of goods.\nAs demonstrated in the present study, inadequate infrastructure and non-transparency of tax revenues were among the most important problems related to VATs, which could have a significant impact on the allocation of resources to the health sector. In Ziyai [62], the complexity of National Tax Administration, Insufficient information, inappropriate software, and inadequate training of tax officials could hinder the optimal implementation of the VAT system. In the research by Mobini [63], three categories of barriers, i.e., cultural, administrative, and structural, had been further identified as the main barriers to the establishment of the VAT system.\nRegarding the allocation and use of VAT resources, all ministries and agencies should be viewed with the same and equitable perspective. Increasing VATs and allocating them to the health sector should be thus disciplined and reasonable. Improving the infrastructure of the health sector and meeting the health needs have deprived and less privileged areas, are the most important uses of VAT.\nAnother important issue was that green taxes should be filed according to different conditions such as elasticity in the market and consumer preferences. Goal setting for green taxes accordingly requires access to the necessary information and data, proper monitoring, as well as some effective mechanisms for collecting and spending them. On the other hand, the deterrence and\neffects of green taxes must be thus evaluated. It is thus essential to increase the costs of violations, abuses, and chaos. Designing green taxes and observing economic and political considerations can be accordingly among the decisive factors in the successful implementation of tax policies. There were also several investigations on the effects of green taxes, as mentioned below, whose results were in line with the findings of the present study.\nIn Hosseinzadeh and Madah [64], the significant effect of green taxes on reduced consumption of environmentally polluting goods had given importance to tax tools as a significant solution to diminish pollution. In Izadkhasti et\u00a0al. [65], green taxes had also reduced the emission of pollutants. At the same time, minimizing the emission of pollutants had increased health indicators.\nThe study by Dissou and Eyland [66] had correspondingly stated that the reason for the discrepancy in the results and the effects of pollution taxes in different countries could be attributed to the costs imposed by the implementation of policies on different parts of those countries. Hadian and Ostadzad [67] had further shown that pollution taxes could boost social welfare by reducing the emission of environmental pollutants and demote social welfare by decreasing production and consequently lowering consumption. The results of these two effects could accordingly increase or decrease social welfare [67]. A study in Spain (2011) had also shown that green tax reform was an important tool for environmental protection and could make the tax system much more efficient [68].\nIn a study (2014), it had been reported that the profitability of polluting industrial products was far and significantly higher than this amount in clean industries. In terms of policies, it was necessary to establish some measures to prevent environmental degradation and health threats by applying green taxes [69]. In another survey (2016), it had been further emphasized that policymakers and planners needed to pay more attention to the appropriate collection of green taxes to achieve sustainable development in order to compensate for environmental degradation [70], which was consistent with the results of the present study.\nAnother important issue is that for reasons such as increasing attention and improving the effectiveness of tax policies, green tax is better separated from VATs and considered as a separate tax base. Also, Dealing with pollution and environmental damage, must be continuous and decisive. In addition to helping industries to purchase the necessary facilities and modernize equipment, it is essential to increase the cost of violations and lawlessness.\nAlthough health taxes have been mainly studied in high-income countries (HICs), these experiences can be\napplied for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), because universal health coverage strategies have become increasingly necessary, and this issue depends on the availability of sustainable financial resources [71].\nConsidering that in recent years, many countries have started using specific taxes, and at the same time, few studies have been conducted in the field of specific health taxes [40], thus, the findings of this study can also be used in other countries. On the other hand, many topics of this study have been examined according to health conditions in the world and studies conducted in other countries. High consumption of harmful goods such as unhealthy foods and drinks, and smoking, the spread of environmental pollution in the world, followed by health threats, as well as increased attention to taxes on harmful goods and measures, VATs, and green taxes, these are the important and common issues in most countries. Therefore, the results of this study can be generalized to other countries, especially developing countries."

            "text": "Despite the existing limitations and problems, the collection of specific taxes for the health system within the framework of the necessary rules and policies could be pursued more seriously, and this could at least have two benefits, including providing, maintaining, and promoting health along with financing the health system in a sustainable manner. Many strategies to improve public health accordingly need to be legislated, planned, implemented, and monitored properly, especially in the field of financing and enhancing approaches to health, and specific taxes in the health sector could be the most important requirements and facilitators in this regard.\nAbbreviations VATs: Value-added taxes; INTA: Iran National Tax Administration,; MD: Medical doctorate; MPs: Members of the parliament; WHO: World health organization;\nFS: Fiscal space; LMICs: Low- and middle income countries; HICs: High-income countries.\nAcknowledgements This article was the result of some parts of the PhD thesis in Health Services Management by Mahdi Kooshkebaghi, which was funded and supported by Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.
