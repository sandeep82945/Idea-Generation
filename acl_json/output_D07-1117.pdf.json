    "abstractText": "We present in this paper methods to improve HMM-based part-of-speech (POS) tagging of Mandarin. We model the emission probability of an unknown word using all the characters in the word, and enrich the standard left-to-right trigram estimation of word emission probabilities with a right-to-left prediction of the word by making use of the current and next tags. In addition, we utilize the RankBoost-based reranking algorithm to rerank the N-best outputs of the HMMbased tagger using various n-gram, morphological, and dependency features. Two methods are proposed to improve the generalization performance of the reranking algorithm. Our reranking model achieves an accuracy of 94.68% using n-gram and morphological features on the Penn Chinese Treebank 5.2, and is able to further improve the accuracy to 95.11% with the addition of dependency features.",

            "text": "Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is potentially helpful for many advanced natural language processing tasks, for example, named entity recognition, parsing, and sentence boundary detection. Much research has been done to improve tagging performance for a variety of languages. The state-of-theart systems have achieved an accuracy of 97% for English on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus (which contains 4.5M words) using various models (Brants, 2000; Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Thede and Harper, 1999). Lower accuracies have been reported\nin the literature for Mandarin POS tagging (Tseng et al., 2005; Xue et al., 2002). This is, in part, due to the relatively small size and the different annotation guidelines (e.g., granularity of the tag set) for the annotated corpus of Mandarin. Xue at el. (2002) and Tseng at el. (2005) reported accuracies of 93% and 93.74% on CTB-I (Xue et al., 2002) (100K words) and CTB 5.0 (500K words), respectively, each using a Maximum Entropy approach. The characteristics of Mandarin make it harder to tag than English. Chinese words tend to have greater POS tag ambiguity than English. Tseng at el. (2005) reported that 29.9% of the words in CTB have more than one POS assignment compared to 19.8% of the English words in WSJ. Moreover, the morphological properties of Chinese words complicate the prediction of POS type for unknown words.\nThese challenges for Mandarin POS tagging suggest the need to develop more sophisticated methods. In this paper, we investigate the use of a discriminative reranking approach to increase Mandarin tagging accuracy. Reranking approaches (Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Chen et al., 2002; Collins and Koo, 2005; Ji et al., 2006; Roark et al., 2006) have been successfully applied to many NLP applications, including parsing, named entity recognition, sentence boundary detection, etc. To the best of our knowledge, reranking approaches have not been used for POS tagging, possibly due to the already high levels of accuracy for English, which leave little room for further improvement. However, the relatively poorer performance of existing methods on Mandarin POS tagging makes reranking a much more compelling technique to evaluate. In this paper, we use reranking to improve tagging performance of an HMM tagger adapted to\n1093\nMandarin. Hidden Markov models are simple and effective, but unlike discriminative models, such as Maximum Entropy models (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and Conditional Random Fields (John Lafferty, 2001), they have more difficulty utilizing a rich set of conditionally dependent features. This limitation can be overcome by utilizing reranking approaches, which are able to make use of the features extracted from the tagging hypotheses produced by the HMM tagger. Reranking also has advantages over MaxEnt and CRF models. It is able to use any features extracted from entire labeled sentences, including those that cannot be incorporated into MaxEnt and CRF models due to inference difficulties. In addition, reranking methods are able to utilize the information provided by N-best lists. Finally, the decoding phase of reranking is much simpler.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. We describe the HMM tagger in Section 2. We discuss the modifications to better handle unknown words in Mandarin and to enrich the word emission probabilities through the combination of bi-directional estimations. In Section 3, we first describe the reranking algorithm and then propose two methods to improve its performance. We also describe the features that will be used for Mandarin POS reranking in Section 3. Experimental results are given in Section 4. Conclusions and future work appear in Section 5."

            "text": "The HMM tagger used in this work is a secondorder HMM tagger initially developed for English by Thede and Harper (1999). This state-of-the-art second-order HMM tagger uses trigram transition probability estimations, P (ti|ti\u22122ti\u22121), and trigram emission probability estimations, P (wi|ti\u22121ti). Let ti1 denote the tag sequence t1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ti, and wi1 denote the word sequencew1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , wi. The tagging problem can be formally defined as finding the best tag sequence \u03c4(wN1 ) for the word sequence w N 1 of length N as follows1:\n\u03c4(wN1 ) = arg max tN1 P (tN1 |wN1 ) = arg max tN1\nP (tN1 w N 1 )\nP (wN1 )\n= arg max tN1\nP (tN1 w N 1 ) (1)\n= arg max tN1 \u220f i P (ti|ti\u221211 w i\u22121 1 )P (wi|t i 1w i\u22121 1 )\n1We assume that symbols exist implicitly for boundary conditions.\n\u2248 arg max tN1 \u220f i P (ti|ti\u22122ti\u22121)P (wi|ti\u22121ti) (2)\nThe best tag sequence \u03c4(wN1 ) can be determined efficiently using the Viterbi algorithm.\nFor estimating emission probabilities of unknown words (i.e., words that do not appear in the training data) in English (and similarly for other inflected languages), a weighted sum of P (ski |ti\u22121ti) (with k up to four) was used as an approximation, where ski is the suffix of length k of word wi (e.g., s 1 i is the last character of word wi). The suffix information and three binary features (i.e., whether the word is capitalized, whether the word is hyphenated, and whether the word contains numbers) are combined to estimate the emission probabilities of unknown words.\nThe interpolation weights for smoothing transition, emission, and suffix probabilities were estimated using the log-based Thede smoothing method (Thede and Harper, 1999) as follows:\nPThede(n-gram) = \u03bb(n-gram)PML(n-gram) +\n(1\u2212 \u03bb(n-gram))PThede((n-1)-gram)\nwhere:\nPML(n-gram) = the ML estimation \u03bb(n-gram) = f(n-gram count)\nf(x) = loga(x+ 1) + b\nloga(x+ 1) + (b+ 1)\nWhile porting the HMM-based English POS tagger to Mandarin is fairly straightforward for words seen in the training data, some thought is required to handle unknown words due to the morphology differences between the two languages. First, in Mandarin, there is no capitalization and no hyphenation. Second, although Chinese has morphology, it is not the same as in English; words tend to contain far fewer characters than inflected words in English, so word endings will tend to be short, say one or two characters long. Hence, in our baseline model (denoted HMM baseline), we simply utilize word endings of up to two characters in length along with a binary feature of whether the word contains numbers or not. In the next two subsections, we describe two ways in which we enhance this simple HMM baseline model."

            "text": "Chinese words are quite different from English words, and the word formation process for Chinese words can be quite complex (Packard, 2000). Indeed, the last characters in a Chinese word are, in some cases, most informative of the POS type, while for others, it is the characters at the beginning. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for a character in the middle of a word to provide some evidence for the POS type of the word. Hence, we chose to employ a rather simple but effective method to estimate the emission probability, P (wi|ti\u22121, ti), of an unknown word, wi. We use the geometric average2 of the emission probability of the characters in the word, i.e., P (ck|ti\u22121, ti) with ck being the k-th character in the word. Since some of the characters in wi may not have appeared in any word tagged as ti in that context in the training data, only characters that are observed in this context are used in the computation of the geometric average, as shown below: P (wi|ti\u22121, ti) = n \u221a \u220f\nck\u2208wi,P (ck|ti\u22121,ti)6=0\nP (ck|ti\u22121, ti) (3)\nwhere\nn = |{ck \u2208 wi|P (ck|ti\u22121, ti) 6= 0}|"

Although the interaction between wi and the next tag ti+1 is captured to some extent when ti+1 is generated by the model, this implicit interaction may not be as effective as adding the information more directly to the model. Hence, we chose to apply the constraint explicitly in our HMM framework by replacing P (wi|ti\u22121ti) in Equation 2 with P \u03bb(wi|ti\u22121ti)P 1\u2212\u03bb(wi|titi+1) for both known and unknown words, with \u03c4(wN1 ) determined by:\n\u03c4(wN1 ) = arg max tN1 \u220f i (P (ti|ti\u22122ti\u22121)\u00d7\nP\u03bb(wi|ti\u22121ti)P 1\u2212\u03bb(wi|titi+1)) (4)\n2Based on preliminary testing, the geometric average provided greater tag accuracy than the arithmetic average.\nThis corresponds to a mixture model of two generation paths, one from the left and one from the right, to approximate \u03c4(wN1 ) in Equation 1 in a different way.\n\u03c4(wN1 ) = arg max tN1 P (tN1 w N 1 )\n= arg max tN1\nP (tN1 )P (w N 1 |tN1 )\nP (tN1 ) \u2248 \u220f i P (ti|ti\u22121ti\u22122)\nP (wN1 |tN1 ) = P\u03bb(wN1 |tN1 )P 1\u2212\u03bb(wN1 |tN1 ) \u2248 \u220f i P\u03bb(wi|ti\u22121ti)P 1\u2212\u03bb(wi|titi+1)\nIn this case, the decoding process involves the computation of three local probabilities, i.e., P (ti|ti\u22122ti\u22121), P (wi|ti\u22121ti), and P (wi|titi+1). By using a simple manipulation that shifts the time index of P (wi|titi+1) in Equation 4 by two time slices3 (i.e., by replacing P (wi|titi+1) with P (wi\u22122|ti\u22122ti\u22121)), we are able to compute \u03c4(wN1 ) in Equation 4 with the same asymptotic time complexity of decoding as in Equation 2."

We found that for those features for which either W+k or W\u2212k equals zero, the update formula in Equation 7 can only increase their weight (in absolute value) in one direction. Although these features are strong and useful, setting their weights too large can be undesirable in that it limits the use of other features for reducing the loss.\nBased on this analysis, we have developed and evaluated an update-once method, in which we use the update formula in Equation 7 but limit weight updates so that once a feature is selected on a certain iteration and its weight parameter is updated, it cannot be updated again. Using this method, the weights of the strong features are not allowed to prevent additional features from being considered during the training phase."

In order to design a more sophisticated weight update method that allows multiple updates in both directions while penalizing overly large weights, we have also investigated the addition of a regularization term R(\u03b1\u0304), an exponential function of \u03b1\u0304, to the loss function:\nRegLoss(\u03b1\u0304) = \u2211 i ni\u2211 j=2 Si,je \u2212Mi,j(\u03b1\u0304) +R(\u03b1\u0304)\nR(\u03b1\u0304) = m\u2211 k=1 pk \u00b7 (e\u2212\u03b1k + e\u03b1k \u2212 2)\nwhere pk is the penalty weight of parameter \u03b1k. The reason that we chose this form of regularization is that (e\u2212\u03b1k +e\u03b1k\u22122) is a symmetric, monotonically decreasing function of |\u03b1k|, and more importantly it provides a closed analytical expression of the weight update formula similar to Equations 5 and 6. Hence, the best feature/update pair for the regularized loss function is defined as follows:\nk\u2217 = arg max k \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u221aW+k + pke\u2212\u03b1k \u2212\u221aW\u2212k + pke+\u03b1k \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b4\u2217 = 1\n2 log\nW+k\u2217 + pk\u2217e \u2212\u03b1k\u2217 W\u2212k\u2217 + pk\u2217e +\u03b1k\u2217\nThere are many ways of choosing pk, the penalty weight of \u03b1k. In this paper, we use the values of \u03b2 \u00b7(W+k +W \u2212 k ) at the beginning of the first iteration (after \u03b10 is determined) for pk, where \u03b2 is a weighting parameter to be tuned on the development set. The regularized weight update formula has many advantages. It is always well defined no matter what value W+k and W \u2212 k take, in contrast to Equation 6. For all features, even in the case when either W+k or W\u2212k equals zero, the regularized update formula allows weight updates in two directions. If the weight is small, W+k and W \u2212 k have more impact on determining the weight update direction, however, when the weight becomes large, the regularization factors pke \u2212\u03b1 and pke+\u03b1 favor reducing the weight."

            "text": "A reranking model has the flexibility of incorporating any type of feature extracted from N-best candidates. For the work presented in this paper, we examine three types of features. For each window of three word/tag pairs, we extract all the n-grams, except those that are comprised of only one word/tag pair, or only tags, or only words, or do not include either the word or tag in the center word/tag pair. These constitute the n-gram feature set.\nIn order to better handle unknown words, we also extract the two most important types of morphological features5 that were utilized in (Tseng et al., 2005) for those words that appear no more than seven times (following their convention) in the training set:\nAffixation features: we use character n-gram prefixes and suffixes for n up to 4. For example, for word/tag pair D /NN (InformationBag, i.e., folder), we add the following features: (prefix1, D, NN), (prefix2, D , NN), (prefix3, D , NN), (suffix1, , NN), (suffix2, , NN), (suffix3, D , NN).\nAffixPOS features6: we used the training set to build a prefix/POS and suffix/POS dictionary associating possible tags with each prefix and\n5Tseng at el. also used other morphological features that require additional resources to which we do not have access.\n6AffixPOS features are somewhat different from the CTBMorph features used in (Tseng et al., 2005), where a morpheme/POS dictionary with the possible tags for all morphemes in the training set was used instead of two separate dictionaries for prefix and suffix. AffixPOS features perform slightly better in our task than the CTB-morph features.\nsuffix in the training set. The AffixPOS features indicate the set of tags a given affix could have. For the same example D /NN, D occurred as prefix in both NN and VV words in the training data. So we add the following features based on the prefix D: (prefix, D, NN, 1, NN), (prefix, D, VV, 1, NN), and (prefix, D, X, 0, NN) for every tag X not in {NN, VV}, where 1 and 0 are indicator values. Features are extracted in the similar way for the suffix .\nThe n-gram and morphological features are easy to compute, however, they have difficulty in capturing the long distance information related to syntactic relationships that might help POS tagging accuracy. In order to examine the effectiveness of utilizing syntactic information in tagging, we have also experimented with dependency features that are extracted based on automatic parse trees. First a bracketing parser (the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000) in our case) is used to generate the parse tree of a sentence, then the const2dep tool developed by Hwa was utilized to convert the bracketing tree to a dependency tree based on the head percolation table developed by the second author. The dependency tree is comprised of a set of dependency relations among word pairs. A dependency relation is a triple \u3008word-a, word-b, relation\u3009, in which word-a is governed by word-b with grammatical relation denoted as relation. For example, in the sentence \u201c \u00cf(Tibet) \u00cfN(economy) \u00fa \u00be(construction) \u00d6 (achieves) >W(significant) \u00e9(accomplishments)\u201d, one example dependency relation is \u3008\u00d6 , \u00e9, mod\u3009. Given these dependency relations, we then extract dependency features (in total 36 features for each relation) by examining the POS tags of the words for each tagging candidate of a sentence. The relative positions of the word pairs are also taken into account for some features. For example, if \u00d6 and \u00e9 in the above sentence are tagged as VV and NN respectively in one candidate, then two example dependency features are (dep-1, \u00d6 , VV, \u00e9, NN, mod), (dep-14, \u00d6 , VV, NN, right, mod), in which dep-1 and dep-14 are feature types and right indicates that word-b (\u00d6 ) is to the right of word-a ( \u00e9)."

Its format is similar to the English WSJ Penn Treebank, and it was carefully annotated. There are 33 POS tags used, to which we add tags to discriminate among punctuation types. The original POS tag for punctuation was PU; we created new POS tags for each distinct punctuation type (e.g., PU-?).\nThe CTB corpus was collected during different time periods from different sources with a diversity of articles. In order to obtain a representative split of training, development, and test sets, we divide the whole corpus into blocks of 10 files by sorted order. For each block, the first file is used for development, the second file is used for test, and the remaining 8 files are used for training. Table 1 gives the basic statistics on the data. The development set is used to determine the parameter \u03bb in Equation 4, the smoothing parameter in Equation 7, the weight parameter \u03b2 described in Section 3.3, and the number of boosting rounds in the reranking model. In order to train the reranking model, the method in (Collins and Koo, 2005) is used to prepare the N-best training examples. We divided the training set into 20 chunks, with each chunk N-best tagged by the HMM model trained on the combination of the other 19 chunks. The development set is N-best tagged by the HMM model trained on the training set, and the test set is N-best tagged by the HMM model trained on the combination of the training set and the development set.\nIn the following subsections, we will first examine the HMM models alone to determine the best HMM configuration to use to generate the N-best candidates, and then evaluate the reranking models.

Note that emission probabilities of unknown words are estimated based on characters using the same \u03bb for combination. When \u03bb = 1.0, the model uses only the standard left-to-right prediction of words, while when \u03bb = 0 it uses only the right-toleft estimation. It is interesting to note that the rightto-left estimation results in greater accuracy than the left-to-right estimation. This might be because there is stronger interaction between a word and its next tag. Also as shown in Figure 1, the estimations in the two directions are complementary to each other, with \u03bb = 0.5 performing best. The performance of the HMM taggers on the test set is given in Table 2 for the best operating point, as well as the two other extreme operating points to compare the left-to-right and right-to-left constraints. Our best HMM tagger further improves the tag accuracy significantly from 93.43% (\u03bb = 1.0) to 94.01% (\u03bb = 0.5)."

            "text": "The HMM tagger with the best accuracy (i.e., the one with \u03bb = 0.5 in Table 2) is used to generate the N-Best tagging candidates, with a maximum of 100 candidates. As shown in Table 3, a maximum of 100-Best provides a reasonable margin for improvement in the reranking task.\nWe first test the performance of the reranking methods using only the n-gram feature set, which contains around 18 million features. Later, we will investigate the addition of morphological features and dependency features. The smoothing parameter (for Collins\u2019 method and the updateonce method) and the weight parameter \u03b2 (for the regularization method) both have great impact on reranking performance. We trained various reranking models with values of 0.0001 \u00d7 {1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100}, and \u03b2 values of {0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1}. For all these parameter values, 600,000 rounds of iterations were executed on the training set. The development set was used to determine the early stopping point in training. If not mentioned explicitly, all the results reported are based on the best parameters tuned on the development set.\nTable 4 reports the performance of the best HMM tagger and the three reranking taggers on the test set. All three reranking methods improve the HMM tagger significantly. Also, the update-once and regularization methods both outperform Collins\u2019 original training method significantly.\nWe observed that no matter which value the smoothing parameter takes, there are only about 10,000 non-zero features finally selected by Collins\u2019 original method. In contrast, the two new methods select substantially more features, as shown in Table 5. As mentioned before, there are some strong features that only appear in positive or negative samples, i.e., either W+k or W \u2212 k equals zero. Although introducing the smoothing parameter in Equation 7 prevents infinite weight values, the update to the feature weights is no longer optimal (in terms of minimizing the error function). Since the update is not optimal, subsequent iterations may still focus on these features (and thus ignore other weaker but informative features) and always increase their weights in one direction, leading to biased training.\nThe update-once method at each iteration selects a new feature that has the most impact in reducing the training loss function. It has the advantage of preventing increasingly large weights from being assigned to the strong features, enabling the update of other features. The regularization method allows multiple updates and also penalizes large weights. Once a feature is selected and has its weight updated, no matter how strong the feature is, the weight value is optimal in terms of the current weights of other features, so that the training algorithm would choose another feature to update. A previously selected feature may be selected again if it becomes suboptimal due to a change in the weights of other features.\nWe next add morphological features to the n-gram features selected by the reranking methods7. As can be seen by comparing Table 6 to Table 4, morphological features improve the tagging accuracy of unknown words. It should be noted that the improvement made by both update-one and regularization methods is statistically significant over using ngram features alone; however, the improvement by Collins\u2019 original method is not significant. This suggests that the two new methods are able to utilize a greater variety of features than the original method.\nWe trained several Charniak parsers using the same method for the HMM taggers to generate automatic parse trees for training, development, and test data. The update-once method is used to evaluate the effectiveness of dependency features for reranking, as shown in Table 7. The parser has an overall tagging accuracy that is greater than that of the best HMM tagger, but worse than that of the reranking models using n-gram and morphological features. It is interesting to note that reranking with the dependency features alone improves the tagging accuracy significantly, outperforming reranking models using n-gram and morphological features. This suggests that the long distance features based on the syntactic structure of the sentence are very beneficial for POS tagging of Mandarin. Moreover, n-gram and morphological features are complementary to the dependency features, with their combination performing the best. The n-gram features improve the accuracy on known words, while the morphological features improve the accuracy on unknown words. The best accuracy of 95.11% is an 18% relative reduction in error compared to the best HMM tagger.\n7Because the size of the combined feature set of all n-gram features and morphological features is too large to be handled by our server, we chose to add morphological features to the n-gram features selected by the reranking methods, and then retrain the reranking model."

The effectiveness of dependency features suggests that syntax-based long distance features are important for improving partof-speech tagging performance in Mandarin. Although parsing is computationally more demanding than tagging, we hope to identify related features that can be extracted more efficiently.\nIn future efforts, we plan to extract additional reranking features utilizing more explicitly the characteristics of Mandarin.
